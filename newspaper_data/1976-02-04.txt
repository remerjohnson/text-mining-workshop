Emphasis On 
Solving Library ,~ 
Problems 

by PbWp baae 
StaHWrtter 

After the rapid growth of the UC 
San Diego Library in the past few 
years, the development of new 
facilities will no longer be the 
major priority of ' the Library, 
according to Alvina Robertson, 
Business officer for the UCSD 
Library. 

Robertson said that the em-
phasis will be placed on solving the 
current problems of the library 
with its five branches. 

The completion of the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography -
which should be ready by the end of 
the year - will mark the end of 
major building of library facilities 

Saxon Returns To 
UCSD On Friday 

by Mark Stadler 
News Editor 

President Saxon is returning to 
UCSan Diego. 

Saxon will meet with 
representatives of the Academic 
Senate (AS) and Chancellor's Club 
members Friday, Chancellor 
McElroy said yesterday. 

New Names 
Added in 
Saxon Charges 

This will be Saxon's first visit to 
UCSD since Nov. 25, when his visit 
was interrupted by students 
angered at his responses to 
questions about Central 
Intelligence Agency involvement 
on UC campuses. 

Fourteen people were charged 
with violations of campus 
regulations in connection with that 
demonstration. 

atUCSD. There vvere a lot of vvet tennis shoes this Tuesday . 

Two students have been added to 
the list of those charged in the Nov. 
25 demonstration which protested 
President Saxon's policy toward 
Central Intelligence Agency in-
volvement on UC campuses. 

The next building project is not 
scheduled to begin construction 
until 1980 when an extension is 
planned for the north side of the 
Centra l University Library. 
Robertson said the extension will 
add more than 87,000 sq. f1. to the 
first and second floors of the CUL. 

With the deemphasis on building 
programs, the UCSD library will 
seek to improve the existing 
structures and upgrade the ser-
vices offered said Robertson. 

Problem Recoplzed 
According to Robertson, the 

problems that have plagued the 
Cluster I Undergraduate Library 
have been recognized and attempts 
are now being made to rectify 
them. 

Among the most pressing 
problems encountered by the staff 
were that of excess noise and poor 
lighting. 

According to a noise and lighting 
survey made in 1973 by the UC 
'Office of Environmental Health 
and Safety "all of the work stations 
monitored," at the Cluster 
Library, " were unsatisfactory" for 
the amount and quality of 
illwnination available; only " the 
chafrs by the magazines had 
enought light" to meet minimwn 
standards set by the American 
Standards Institute. 

The survey goes on to say that 
"no sound levels e15ceeding 90 
decibels, a legal limit for hearing 
loss, were found," but enough

Woman, Chicano Preferred 
To Fill Regent's Vacancies 

One student, charged with 
violations of campus regulations 
but previously unidentified, was 
positively identified last week, 
Vice-chancellor and Dean of 
Student Affairs George Murphy 
said Monday. 

by James G. Soto 
City Editor 

One of the new UC Regents will 
be a woman and the other will 
probably be a member of a 
minority, according to Otis Wat-
son, the student representative to 
the regental selection committee. 

Watson, the only student on the 
statewide Committee Advisory to 
Gov. Brown in the Selections of 
Regents for UC, said it was the 
consensus of the committee that a 
woman should probably be 
selected to fiH the vacancy to be 
created by Mrs. Edward Heller's 
departure from the Regents in 
June. 

According to Watsoll , he and 
Heller have been lobbying for a 
minority appointee for the other 
vacancy created by the expiration 
of Regent Norton Simon's term on 
the board. 

Watson said there has been 
considerable sentiment for 
nominating a Chicano to the 
Regents. He said that HeHer has 
also suggested the possibility of 
nOminating an Oriental as a 
Regent. 

Present Evidence 
This week Watson will travel to 

Sacramento to giv.e oral testimony 
to Prebel Stolz, one of Brown's 
assistants, and Carlota Mullins, 
Brown's secretary for personnel 
appointments. He will present 
evidence in support of his can-
didate, who is unknown at the 
present time. 

While in Sacramento, he will also 
be meeting with representatives of 
the Statewide Chicano Steering 
Committee, Lt. Gov. Mervyn 
Dymally and the Black Legislative 
Caucus to lobby for the Chicano 
nominee. 

Another, who previously hadn 't 
replied to Murphy's query 
regarding the demonstration, 
recently answered that letter. 

Both s tudents have elected to 
join the " common defense," 
Murphy said. 

The students, now 10 in number, 
are charged with failure to comply 
with directions from a university 
official, resisting a university 
official performing his duties and 
endangering a person's health and 
safety. 

Signup Sheets 
In a related measure, Murphy 

" A Chicano could very well be said Monday that a signup sheet

UC President David Saxon 
_ AS Reps 

Saxon will meet with a group of 
Academic Senate representatives 
in the early afternoon, Lynn 
Harris, the administrative 
assistant to the AS, said yesterday. 

Harris said members of the AS 
group will include the Executive 
and Policy Committee, past AS 
chairman, certain senate com-
mittee chairs and the heads of each 
colJege faculty. 

Saxon's last visit was to include a 
speech to the AS. However, that 
meeting was disrupted. Friday 
Saxon plans to speak infonnally 
with the representatives, McElroy 
said. 

Then, at 4:00 that afternoon, 
Saxon will meet with the Chan-
cellor's Club, a group of people who 
pay $250 a year to join that 
organization and meet bi-monthly 
with the Chancellor to hear about 
UCSD. 

McElroy said Saxon would 
probably speak to the Chancellor's 
Club about the state of UC, Gov. 
Brown's proposed budget and 
UCSD in general. 

Asmus to Lecture 
At last week's meeting, Stolz 

outlined what the governor wanted 
from the committee. Brown will 
ask that each of the 12 members 
submit a list of two or three can-
didates to Brown's office

scheduled last summer. 

New Spending Limit Set On Lasars and DaVinci 
Lasers and Leonardo Da Vinci 

will be the subject of a special 
lecture to be held at UC San Diego 
tomorrow nlg~. 

John Asmus, as associate 
research physicist for the UCSD 
Institute for Pure and Applied 
Physical Sciences, will describe 
the use ~ laser technology in art 
restoration. 

Asmus will ~ speaking at USB 
2722 at 8 pm. His lecture is IlIOn-
sored by the UC San Diego Alumni 
and Friends and ls open to the 
general public. There is no charge. 

Asmus has been involved in a 
search for a lost fresco ~ Leooardo 
Da Vinci in Florence, Ita!y. His 
work in Italy was a major factor in 
the founding ~ an Art/Science 
tudies ProJect at UCSD. 

Discovert ... the True Ale 
Asmus has specialized In 

adapting laser technology for 

locating art treasures for both the 
govenunent and private industry 
for the put 15 years. His work has 
led to the restoration and 
cataloguing ~ certain art works. 
In addition, his work has been 
instrumental in discovering the 
true age of many, heretofore, 
unidentifia ble treasures. 

Using brief, localized pulses of 
laser energy, art works could' be 
cleaned of surface materials 
without marring the treasures 
themaelves. The Asmus method 
has been able to restore works in a 
few hoW'J that previously took 
months of tedious, painstaking 
hard work. 

Asmus will also be speaking 
later in the month for the Friends 
of the Library on using laser 
energy to restore and conserve 
classic manuscripts. 

Â·Final Approval 

At that time, Brown's staff will 
consider the names on the com-
mittee members' lists as well as 
other names that have been sui). 
mitted to the governor's office. 
Brown and his staff will then select 
two names and send them back to 
the committee for final approval.

For Del Mar Candidates 
A new spending limit has been set for Del Mar municipal elections 

which will allow candidates to spend more but will decrease the amount 
that contributors may give. The new law will be in effect for the March 2 
election which will decide three city council seats, the Del Mar Com-
munity Plan, and the recall of Councilmember John Weare. 

Under the new law, campaigns'will be restrided to spending no more 
than 18 cents per voter, three cents more than und r the previous law. 
According to the City Clerk's office this will work out to around $638 per 
campaign, based on the number of register d voters in the last election. 
Contributors will be limited to contributions of no more than $15 in any 
particular campaign. This figure is down from the $25 contributions 
permitted under th old law. The Council said the decrea e was pa ed to 
encourage a broad-based campaign and to fcrce vot rs to u campaign 
committ es. 



Wedne.y, February., 1171 

IRI 
Jimmy Crack Corn _. 

The clean cut young man who has positioned himself on the aisle seat in 
the first row is ready with the first question when Jimmy Carter finished 
his opening remarks at his little gathering at the University of New 
Hampshire, at Durham. . 

'Government Should Assert the Public Interesf 

I have heard the same introductbry comment by the candidate three 
times now, and I suppose it telJs something of his presence and manner 
that it doesn't sound as corny as it reads in print afterward. He wants 
"our nation to have, once again, a govenunent as good and honest and 
decent and truthful and fair and competent and idealistic and c0m-
passionate, and as filled with love as are the American people." 

He says it in a low voice and a little catch in his throat, as though it were 
. occuring to him for the first time. The audience sits silent They don' t 
applaud. They are impressed. Candidate -Hayden Meets the Press So the young man on the aisle seat stands up and asks a question, and 
the Yankee listeners who maybe are Congregationalists and tight-lipped 
about religion, cringe a little because he asks Carter, in evangelical 
jargon, "Are you saved?" That old cynic Henry Mencken, with his china 
blue eyes, would rub his hands and gloat over the situation. It just em-
barrasses us. What will Carter say? 

Following his UC San Diego 
appearance last week, activist 
Tom Hayden - a candidate for 
Johu Tulllley'S US Senate seat -
met with reporten In the Revelle 
iafonnal 1000nge. A selection of 
questions aad auwen follow: 

â¢â¢â¢ 
Question: In your original cam-
paign statment, you said everyone 
should be guaranteed a job. How 
would you achieve that without 
total recoune to govenunent 

employ~nt? 
HaydeD: Well, you make that 
sound awful. 

Do you want total recourse to 
govenunent welfare? Do you want 

. govenunent unemployment in-
surance? Or do you want the 
govenunent to put people to work? 

I say we should put people to 
work. 1be Hawkins Bill is the first 
step. 1be second thing is a public 
works program. The public works 
program bas to involve plaming 
by the govenmem and investment 
by the government The different 
kinds of enterprises can range 
from private to co-ops to gover-

the government that they don 't 
think can work. Our program tries 
to lay out thIS alternative, which is 
a more grass roots governmental 
structure. 
Question: Would you explain your 
proposal for handling the CIA? 
Hayden: I think we need a dif-
ferent type of intelligence agency 
that's more in keeping with dif-
ferent foreign policy assumptions. 
I don ' t see the world as a 
dangerous world, with con-
spiracies and Soviet agents 

. breathing down our necks 
everywhere. That's the world that 
the Pentageon would like us to see 
because they are able to get their 
appropriations through a 
suspicious Congress. 

I think that you need In-
telligence including the abili~ to 
know what weapons other CCIUR-
tries have, whether they are 
pointed at us or nOt But I don't 
think spies are effective a-t 
gathering infonnation. 
QuestIOD: Would you favor total1y 
dismantling the CIA and starting 
over? 

terms of benefits when you came 
home. There are enonnous job and 
education problems, drug 
problems ... 

I'd like to see better conditions in 
the VA hospitals. I'd like to see vets 
in charge of sound rehabilitation 
programs. I'd like to see vets 
benefits extended on the campuses 
and I 'd like to see it coupled with 
an amnesty for all the people still 
in exile. I'd like to see both ends of 
our generation, the one that 
resisted the war and the one that 
fought the war, to no longer be 
played against each other. 
Question: What are you willing to 
commit American defense policy 
to? You spoke of protecting the 
continental US and maintaining 
traditional alliances. What are the 
traditional allia.nces? 
Haydea: First, .. think we should 
reduce nuclear overkill, but retain 
a Iluclear deterrent. Second, we 
should cut aid to rig~-wing dic-
tatorships; the Spain, the Por-
tugal, the Chile, the South Korea 
type of dictatorships, before we get 
dragged in on the lIIIJIOPular and 

He pauses for a silence that seems longer than it is, and then amwersÂ· . 
simply and matter-of-factly, "Yes, I am twice-born," and goes on quietly 
from there. A spark has passed between the two; they have com-
municated in their own way, in a language that is more familiar, perhaps, 
in reVivalist Georgia than in snow-bound New Hampshire. We go out into 
the waist-high drifts, wondering who will be the next president and 
whether it could be, just possibly, this surprising political novelty. 

I have a political activist friend in Washington who burst out against 
carter with a vehemence that startled me: " He's a two-faced louse!" he 
ejaculated, or words to that effect. My friend thinks he's a hypocrite -
nuiybe he is prejudiced. Deep down, perhaps he is asking a variant of that 
old question, " can anything good come out of Georgia?" . 

Politicians are permitted a certain degree cI. ambiguity, and their 
survival requires cloudy rhetoric on occasion. In the Iowa caucus on the 
emotional abortion issue Carter said, yes, he was against abortion, no, he 
wasn't for a constitutional amendment, and he added a maybe - maybe 
he would favor some vague federal statute on the subject Democratic 
liberal candidates denounced him for cynical deviousness and Carter won 
the contest. 

My impression is that audiences yearn to believe Jimmy Carter. They 
are looking for something. It is tU manner and tone. He baa a mop of hair 
like a wig turning gray at the ean, a trademark grin, a wann, frieudly 
manner, a pietistic appeal and a homely face of the moat attractive sort 
that reminds Â·one of Eleanor Roosevelt. Underneath is a fint rate In-
telligence and rare ambition - hard as nails. After Annapolis, peanut 
farming and warehousing, and after leading a l~year fig~ to end 
segregation in the local church, the local scbool and the local commun{ty, 
he ran for office with the public support rJ. segregationists like ~ster 
Maddox and of those who nonnally would back George Wallace. 

Did they think they could control him? As governor he hung the picture 
of Martin Luther King in the state capitol, and he has now the support of 
some of Georgia's respected black leaders, Andrew Young and Julian 
Bond. It's as odd a combination as American politics has recently seen. 

At a recent rally of Democratic. presidential hopefuls here, Jimmy 
Carter stunned his audience by Wlexpectedly alUlouncing that if revenue 
sharing of federal funds is extended (as he hopes), the money should be 
sent to cities, not states; that states are diverting money from poor 
people to marg inal capital improvement projects like golf courses and 
parks. Wisconsin's governor Lucey registered sharp " distress," but they 
couldn't budge Jimmy. If he is ambiguous on some things he is obstina te 
on others: "sot" the Yankees call it.

Ploughing aroWid in New Hampshire's snow now, with the primary 
three weeks off, is Ronald Reagan. He is as surprising a candidate in his 
way as carter. At every appearance for two days I heard him tell 
audiences that the state sends "$115 million" alUlually to Washington and 
gets back only " $100 million" in services, so why wouldn't it be better, he 
asked in his frank, likable way, to just keep the money at home and save 
$15 million? 

At his final press conference on the trip, Ted Knap, of Scripps-Howard, 
asked him if that extra $15 million didn't go into the Anny, Navy, Air 
Force and interstate highways and wasn't it IJ bargain, therefore and 
where did he get the statistic anyway? 

rune nt enterprises. I don't think 
that the form of ownership is the 
key thing. U's making sure that 
the tax dollar is wisely invested in 
the job producing area and that 
what you want built is built. 

The role of the government has 
to be to assert the public interest. 
I kn.ow that t.hese days government 
is not in fa shion, especially among 
members of government who seek 
to dissociate themselves and their 
ambitions from the structure that 
they' re in. But my solution to that 
would be for them top resign a nd 
let somebody else' do it differently. 
Not le t them continue to command 

Hayden: Yes, Ithink that you have 
to start over; there are some CIA 
agents that can be rehabilitated, 
but for the most part they have left 
the agency. The ones that saw the 
truth about Vietnam were fired or 
left volunta rily. 
Question: What do you consider to 
be the problems of today's veteran 
population? 
Hayden : Having been sent off to a 
war as champions and heroes and 
coming back to a society where 
there's no respect and no jobs. 
Where the Presidents and officials 
who sent you off cheering you 
would like to forget about you in

Special Issue 

Ronald Reagan registered complete surprise. He explained that he had 
" never understood the thing that way" and that he couldn't remember 
where he got the figure and " if I 'm mistaken," he said disarmingly, "I 
stand corrected ." What more was there to say? 

President Ford will be up in New Hampshire shortly, too, the very 
fountainhead of the movement for a do-less govenunent and a politiCian 
who has staked a great deal on a bold gamble. He says in his budget that 
he knows of no way to get unemployment below seven percent in the 
coming year and is asking for reelection on that basis. Mr. Ford deserves 
a good deal of credit for his frankness and the consistency of t1is beliefs. 

By contrast, when Nixon was up in 1972 he spun the wheels of the 
economy Wltil after election, and then settled back with the slwnp we still 
have. Mr. Ford has asked the nation to tighten its belt, lower its el-
pectations and accept what he proudly calls the "new realism," which 
means the trickled down theory and reliance on private business, not the 
government, to make jobs. .

Physicists L~ok ~t ESP: Not Only Impossible, But ~rue 

by Paullronkwe 
ScieDce Writer 

It is common knowledge to physicists that information transfer between two physically 
separated locations takes place by elec~gnetic wave pr~gation. This could be ~ light, 
microwaves or radio waves. However, It has atso been recognized (by parapsychologISts and 
the common folk) that there are other 'hwnan' ways to transmit information which ap-

rently seem to violate the laws of physics. Such modes of information transfer are 
:lIectJvelY called psi phenomena or more popularly as 'extra-sensory perception ' (ESP). 

Basically, ESP can be classified under four major subdivisions namely telepathy, clair-
voyance, precognition and psychokinesis . Telepathy is information transfer from one mind to 
another by thought; clairvoyance involves discerning events and objects not present to our 
nOrmal senses. In precognition, information of a future event is actually perceived now and 
psychokinesis entails the ability of the mind to exert some force on objects. 

The weird nature of ESP in relation to physics as we now know it, has caused it to be a less 
respected field of investigation. It is not a surprise, therefore, that a majority of physiCists 
have considered scientifically undocumented stories of ESP events as sheer superstition and 
to many ESP may be labelled " essentially superstitious physics." However, the ac-
cumulating weight of scientifically documented evidence under controlled laboratory con-
ditions are causing many to wonder whether the laws of physics have an explanation for such 
phenomena. An answer to this question may bring ab~~t a new revision of our concept of 
space and time, comparable to that of the theory of relatlvlty. 

In search for a physical ex-
planation for ESP, Stanford 
Research IrL'Itltute (SRI) physicist 
and ESP researcher Dr. Russel 
Targ, in a recent colloquium at UC 
San Diego actually confronted 
physicists here with the "im-
possible but true' reality rJ. ESP. 
From our observations, no 
colloquium last quarter attracted 
so large a physics audience. An 
hour after his humor-packed 
presentation, Targ was still an-
swering questions irom the 
inquisitive audience. 

ESP Experimenll 
In the fint part of his talk, Targ 

described well controlled ex-
periments with psychic subjects, 
experiments which stronglysuggesi 
that " a channel elists whereby 
information about a remote 
location can be obtained by means 
of as 'yet unidentified perceptual 
modality." Noteworthy from the 
impressive catalogue of his ex-
periments with psychics is the 
ability of two psychics. 

IngoSwaM- a New York artist and Pat Price - a forme r police commissioner capable of the 
following feats : describing the contents of a sealed envelope hidden in another room. rais ing 
the temperature of an object and describing in words and drawings a remote geographical 
site not previously known to the subject. According to Targ, these experiments were con-
ducted under sufficient control, " utilizing visual, accoustic and electrica l shielding, to ensure 
that all conventional paths of sensory input were blocked." Most of these experiments were 
carried out under such conditions that the probability of the subjects giving a cor rect answer 
by guessing was one in a million ! To date, he added, many of these remote v iewing ex-
periments have been " very sa tisfactorily" replicated at UCSB, UC Berkeley a nd at Stanford. 

MAJOR DISCOVERIES 
After over three years of intensive investigation , the SRI group a ppears to have pinned 

down certain physical characteristics of ESP. Unlike infonnation transfer by elec-
tromagnetic waves, information transfer by ESP, Targ noted , is independent of distance and 
all types of electromagnetic shielding and in some cases (precognition ) can travel faste r than 
the speed of light! Another surprising discovery of the SRI group is that 'objects in ra pid 
motion are in general not perceived' by an ESP subject. 

Physiologically, the SRI ~xperimenters have not found any correlation between elec-
troencephalographic (EEG ) brainwave recordings of a subject and the ability to receive ESP 
signa ls. In fact, thei r experiments with numerous subjects Indicate that everyone is a 
potential ESP receive r. " We have not fOWid anyone who could not do this." "We did not find a 
class of people who failed ... ," Targ emphasized. 

BRAIN WAVE EXPERIMENTS 
The most dramatic aspect of the SRI experiments were the brainwave experiments in 

which a subject, resting with eyes shut, had her brain-waves shifted to a higher frequency 
when a strobe lamp was flashed at 6 HZ or 16 HZ for 10 second intervals in a distant 

I~boratory, even though the subject was unaware on a cognitive level of exactly when the 
hght was flashed. " We consider this probably the most important of the experiments we have 
done," Targ said, " in tliat we have direct phys iological evidence for a kind of rroncognitive 
perception of a remote target." 

MAGNETOMETER EXPERIMENTS 
As though the above experiments might not be convincing enough to physicists, Targ also 

has gone further to seek other demonstrable evidence for ESP. A squid magneometer inside a 
superconducting shield is reputed to be non-perturbable. Can psychic psychokinetically in-
fluence its swing? Experimenting with the psychic artist Ingo Swann, the SRI researchers 
found that of all recorded perturbations of the magnetometer, twice as many occurred during 
the psychic's working time as did occur at other times! 

THEORIES AND SPECULATIONS 
"wt.>lt"is not forbidden is required" P.A.M. Dirac 

Targ appears to be fully aware of the wall of skepticism his ESP experiments was bound to 
meet with especially when talking to an audience of distinguished phYSicists. " What brings 
me to La Jolla," he stressed, " is that what I'm telling you is not only 'impossible' but is also 
true and what I look forward to from physicists here is to help reconcile the impossible with 
the true and make some sort of physical reconstruction in which this can be permitted to 
ha ppen instead of forbidden ... " 

He added that as of da te, there is yet no comprehensive physical theory for ESP 
phenomena. " Different people have different ideas a nd it is a n open subject" he noted. 
However, a few big names in physics have occassiona lly reflected on ESP. David Bohm, he 
said , believes in a kind of 'Quantum Connectedness' a nd holds the view that quantwn theory 
predic ts a connectedness transcending space a nd time and that if this kind of thing (ESP) 
were not observed, then he would think there is something wrong with quantum mechanics . 
Oliver Costa deVorre, a French relativist, fa vors a kind of advanced potential theory ex-
planation for precognition , and the Soviets, who a ppear to be ahead of the US in the ESP race, 
are convinced of an E LF (electromagnetic low frequency) explanation. However, Targ 
thinks that the 'data-rat e is too high to admit to this expla nation.' The SRI group is not without 
a theory of its own. Their experiments have suggested that certain s!lbjects can have' access 
to future time' and are able to describe correctly certain events before they happen. Hence, 
the SRI group favors a theory that includes a n additional coordinate of complex time in which 
information is mediated by tachyons (hypothetical particles supposed to travel faster than 
the speed of light): 

n IIluslral,on by Mark Robb 
Readers further interested in 

other views on ESP and physics 
are referred to Arthur Koestler's 
very excit ing book : " The Roots of 
Coincidence" (Vintage Books 
Edition cost $1.95) or for more 
details of the ESP experiments at 
SRI, read: " Information Tran-
smission under Conditions of 
Sensory Shielding" by Russell 
Targ and Harold Puthoff in 
" Nature" of October 18,1974. 

VIEWS ON THAT ESP TALK ... 

Since t he ESP colloquium 
generated so much interest and so 
many questions, our science writer 
Wldertook to get .behind the cur~ 
tains to hear what the professors 
and graduate students a re 
thinking. There a re the views of 
some of those interviewed: 

Lu Jeu Sham (professor of 
physics)-

" Dr. Targ's experimimts sound ve ry interesting, though I think more experiments of a 
confirmatory na ture are needed from other sources, to help theorists. However, I'll mention 
that it is a dangerous attitude to asswne that unexplanable events are necessarily untrue." 

LeonardLieberman (professor of physics)-
" Having worked with magnetometers of the sensitivity described in the lecture, I know how 

difficult, if not impossible, to de tect such small noises and be able to distinguish it from 
geomagnetic noise. Such magnetometers are so sensitive they can detect the presence of 
moving cars. Dr. Targ did not mention any controls which show that in fact the signals were 
not random noise but were due primarily to the psychic's influence." 

Sheldon Schultz ( profe~or of physlcs)-
Asked to comment 00 ESP research and the possibility of sponsoring a pr.ysics graduate 

student thesis on ESP, Profellsor Schultz said : " I think ESP is a legitimate area of research 
and should be encouraged among phys icists. P ersonally, I would be willing to supervise a 
graduate resea rch in this order." In other respects, Schultz had these comments: " The 
remote vtewing experiments were adequately discussed but the brain-wave and 
magnetometer experiments were too briefly described. I think more experiments need to be 
done a nd the question of improving signal to noise of the subject receivers look into. 
Simultaneous of a number of psychics may a lso be valuable." On the distance-
independence of ESP, Schultz said: "It has yet to be quantitatively proved, not assumed .. . " 

JoiuJ Goodkind (professor of . physics) had these comments on the magnetometer ex-
periments. "The magnetometer experiments sounded ve ry qua litative to me. The results he 
obtained cannot be subjected to quanti tative statistical a nalysis." 

Two graduate students had this to say: 
Peter Czipott - I was favorably impressed by the talk, but I still don 't understand its 

physics. We know of four kinds of interactions in physics : nuclear force, electrical in-
teract ions, the beta-decay interaction and g ravity, and none of them is independent of 
distance . Is it possible then that we a re looking at a new kind of interaction, assuming ESP is 
rea lly true? On ESP research, it would be interesting to look into it if such research could be 
supported here. 

Bob caldwell - " I don 't believe t he magnetometer experiments are correctly done." On 
how the ESP s ignals are transferred, Bob said: " It can't be by ELF since a lot of infonnation 
caMot be carried to give a resolution of the type described in the lecture. Now elec-
tromagnetic waves (EMV ) fall off with distance. Hence, if Dr. Targ's observat ions are true, 
it cannot be EMV. What else can it be ... ?" 

Dr Russel Targ will be lecturing in the Frontiers of Science class on February 12. Interested 
students could hear him at HSS 2250 at 1:00 pm.

Events for Seniors Top Third Activities 

by Steve ColmaD 
CalPIRG 

" At least a qUllrter, and perhaps as many as balf of all pharmacies in 
San Diego are violating the provisions of the State's prescription drug 
price posting law. This was the result or a survey of 165 pharmacies in the 
metropolitan area by the California Public Interest Research Group 
(CaIPlRG). . 

The study examined compliance with the drug price posting law, as 
well as compiled drug prices from pbarmacies. The study revealed that 
while most pharmacy prices are within a fairly reasonable range, difÂ· 
ferences between some of the low and high priced pharmacies are as 
great as four to sixÂ·fold. 

COMMENTARY 

by Brian Davis 
Staff Writer 

Two events designed for Third 
College seniors highlight the up-
coming activities for the college. 

Next Monday, the Graduation 
Committee will meet for the first 
time. The committee will begin to 
organize itself for the June 
graduation ceremonies as well as 
make some tentative plans for 
speakers. The committee will meet 
in CR 107 at6:3Op.m.

putting the price poster in some outÂ·ofÂ·the-way corner. Others are placing 
it so far behind the counter that you have to ask to step behind the counter 
in order to read it. 

Prescription drug costs make up a significant portion of total spending 
on health care - 11 % of the total cost of such care. It should be emÂ· 
phasized that high prescription drug prices hurt those least able to pay 
for them - the old and the infirm. While most Americans will spend about 
$30 in the coming year on prescription drugs, the average elderly person 
will spend over $90. Only a portion of drug costs are covered by MediCare, 
MediÂ·Cal, or other insurance. 

Although most students can probably get their prescriptions filled 
mostly cheaply at the Student Health Center, two things should be kept in 
mind. First, the Health Center carries only a limited stock of drugs, so 
you 'll probably find yourself at some point having to purchase drugs from 
a regular pharmacy. Second, as students, we are also members of society 
as a whole. In two or three years most of us will be paying the same in-
flated drug prices as everyone else. It's important that we understand the 
importance of ~derstanding how to obtain price information about 
pharmacies and other health care services. 

For example, few realize that the pharmacist must give out price inÂ· 
formation, no matter how requested (e.g., over the phone). Few know 
that the drug price posters even exist, much less how to use them. 

In order that we, as consumers, be given" the infonnation needed to 
make intelligent choices about the pharmacies we choose, we recomÂ· 
mend to the pharmacists that they utilize their right to advertise drug 
prices. . 

The enormous spread in drug prices indicates that very little price 
competition between pharmacies is taking place. The price posters, while 
a good idea, require that the consumer actually travel to the pharmacies. 
Advertisements, if they provide solid information about the drugs, could 
make comparison of drug prices much easier. 

The lowestÂ·priced pharmacies in different areas were as follows: 
La Jolla: Med Rx Drugs and Burn's Drugs. 
Clairemont: FedMart-Genessee Plaza, Long 's Drugs, and Drug Mart. 
Mission Bay Area : Fed MartÂ·Arena Plaza (lowest County), Med Rx 

DrugsÂ· Pacific Bea ch, and Thrifty Drugs-Pacific Beach. 
North County: Med Rx DrugsÂ·Encinitas, Solana Beach Pharmacy, 

Thrifty DrugsÂ·Encinitas, and Thrifty Drugs-Carlsbad. 
You should a lso consider va r ious services pharmacies provide, along 

with considerations of price. Ask your doctor to write your prescription in 
Engli~h (not Latin), then phone around to several pharmacies to find the 
lowest price. 

Coop Shows 
Concern for 
Credibility 

by Ken Stipanov 
Staff Writer 

Improving the credibility of the 
Student Cooperative was again the 
m!ljor topic of the Coop meeting 
Monday night. 

In recent weeks, the Coop has 
become increasingly concerned 
with its credibility, which many 
members feel is deteriorating. 

Coop members discussed at 
length the poSBibility and value of 
meeting every two weeks to in-
crease attendance and in-
volvement. (Meetings are 
presently held weekly. ) 

Last week, the CQOP discussed 
having large, monthly meetings 
for the same reasons. 

No decision was reached on 
either proposal. 

In other business, the Coop 
approved budget a llocations 
totaling $9017. Major allocations 
included $2500 for Cinco de Mayo 

p~ograms, $1090 for the Muir 
Outing Club, $1050 for a future allÂ· 
campus dance and $3189 for a 
science fiction film festival. 

It is expected that the film 
festival will pay for itself through 
ticket sales.

This Year's Fad: Nutty Chic 
In the last decade and a half, with the ever increasing popularity of 

psycho-prophets like R. D. Laing, novels like "One F lew Over The 
Cuckoo's Nest," and movies like " King Of Hearts" and " A Woman Under 
The Influence," it has become obvious that insanity has been promoted 
into a lyrical state of grace, an aberrant's sanctuary. 

In all likelihood, Milos Forman's film of "Cuckoo's Nest" will make a 
clean sweep at the Academy Awards this year, as it did at the Golden 
Globe Awards. No one, as far as I know, has been so crass as to bestow a 
generic monicker on these works. I might as well be mee-how about 
" nutty chick?" 

Or, better still, IN-sanity? 
Once past coining an encapsulating nomenclature, the categorist's duty 

is to look for culture heroes, media figures who have carved lucra tive 
careers out of being blatant, no-holds-barred imbeciles. He must sea rch 
fol' those who have shown a total disregard for the constricting demands 
of taste , intelligence, and measured sensibilities. In recent years there 
have been very few worthy candidates-Jerry Lewis and Robert Blake 
come immediately to mind, but they must ultimately be disqualified on 
the grounds of displaying varying degrees of actua l talent. 

The only consistently useless, obnoxious, overbearing, and 
schizophrenic of our prime-times is soul brother number 2,756,823 himÂ·

Davis' gushy " mahÂ·mainÂ·man" demeanor was a pose, a humanitarian's 

The Polish Mime Ballet's perÂ· 
formance of " The Managerie of 
Empress Phylissa" was inÂ· 
triguingly billed as an erotic 
portrayal of the sexual awakening 
of a YOWlg woman . 

Phylissa's sexual awakening 
begins with the opening scene of 
the performance as she 
metamorphoses from a YOWlg girl 
playing with a doll to a nymphet 
who receives her suitors in her bed. 
Scarcely leaving her bed, Phylissa 
embarks on a sexual oddessy 
which includes encounters with a 
cavalier, Napoleon, a Nazi and 
biker. At the end of ' the per-
formance, Phylissa crowns her 
sexual conquests by dressing as a 
r ingmaster and taming her enÂ· 
tourage of lovers. Still, Phylissa 
does not find happiness - when she 
meets her last lover, a coinÂ·

... attempt to exude an unequivocal love for everyone he came in contact 
with. The way Sammy hugged Nixon, his uncontrollable spasms of 
laughter on the slightest pretext (often none at all), his lugubrious 
mixture of practiced ghetto philosophizing and pure, unrehearsed in-
coherency, the intensity of his magnificent plea for individuality, " I 
Gotta Be Me," and his gritty blues classic, " Candy Ma n," led me to 
believe that Sammy's mannerisms were a very deliberate attempt to 
aestheticize goonishness. No one could be tha t much of an asshole and not 
realize it.

Sammy, bless his hear, has proven me wrong. He's no foppish actor, 
simply going through the motions of histrionic stupidity. He is the real 
thingÂ·Â·the first actual lunatic to become a celebra ted entertainer. His true 
genius never had a chance to fully bloom until he attained his syndicated 
talk show. This Las Vegas ve rsion of "SunÂ·Up" is a lways graced with 
such luminaries as Guy Marks, Frankie Laine, and Phil Foster. Sta rÂ· 
studd ed lineups like this haven't been seen since the Norm Crosby show. 

Although the ballet deals with 
the empress' sexual experiences as 
billed, the treatment of the subject 
matter is more akin to burlesque 
than the erotic. Each of Phylissa's 
nine encounters evokes laughter

Believe It or Not 
I knOW it is not supposed to happen. In fact, I probably stand to lose my 

last tenuous claims to credibility by reporting it. But it is an inarguable 
truth, hard to believe as it may be. 

In the m~in gym, o~ not only o~e. but two successive nights of this Rast 
weekend, mtercolleglate athletic teams from UC San Diego excited 
people. 

Excited, you scoff? Maybe got the attention of some bored foots. 
Possibly even to the point of mildly interesting thelJl. But sports exciting 
anyone at UCSD? No way, you laugh. 

Well, without trying to sound pigheaded, it did happen. I saw it with my 
own two eyes and felt it. 

This newspaper has reported the facts of these events. Allow me to 
explain the fun. 

â¢â¢â¢ 

Friday night: VolleybalJ. 
Irvine extended UCSD to rive full games. The Tritons scrapped, 

hustled, dove, dug, set, passed, and won. But more imporianUy, tbey 
spiked. 

Every sport has its ultimate. Baseba1J has the homerun. Football, the 
bomb. Boxing, the one punch knockout. 

In volleyball, it is the spike. 
Defense, dinks, finesse, and hustle are fine. They win volleyball 

matches. A vicious, cannonball, floor-denting spike is what the sport is 
reaUy aU about It is what starts the adrenalin flowing in both players 
and fans alike. It is what makes volleyball exciting. 

Just ask Bruce Cazdan. . 
Cazdan, you see, is the team's number one spiker. He carries the big 

bat. The cannon. He throws the Sunday punch. 
Ucs[) has other notable spikers. Big Bob Rhodes gets up the highest. 

JOM Blumenshine grunts the loudest. Tim Myrick has the most fans. But 
Cazdan packs the biggest wallop of them all. Without being tall or blonde, 
two requisites for Southland college power volleyball hitters, Bruce 
strikes the big white ball the way it was meant to be hit. Hard, fast, and 
fierce. 

For Friday night's crowd it was stimulating. They clapped. They 
hooted. 1lIey stomped their feet . They apparently loved it. 

â¢â¢â¢ 
And Saturday night: Basketball. 
The junior varsity pulled their game out in the final minute. The 

- varsity romped. 
Unfortunately for the JVs there were few people present to witness 

their comeback. It takes spectators to generate real excitement. The 
va rsity game drew the big turnout. 

And Mallory Mitchell and Ken Melvin provided the entertainment. 
J'he slam-dunk has, unfortunately, been taken out of college basketball. 

But the sport does ~ot suffer. Not while smooth, slick, flashy guards like 
Mitchell and MelVin play the game. The behind-the-back pass, the 
th~ough-the-Ieg dr:1bble, the twisting, turning, driving lay-up. can all 
bring people to their feet. 

As long as they are done with style. 
Style is what excites basketball fans. Style brings the cheers. It's not 

the meat, it's the motion. 
Such a hard word to define, style is. I will not even try. 
When Mitchell pulls down a one-handed rebound away from players a 

head taller than he is, when he licks his fingertips looks up at the clock at 
the opp?sing team's bench, then rifles a perfect pass through three ~nÂ­

sU~Dectlng defenders, ",;he.n he leads the fastbreak with his high-step 
dribble, when... Mallory IS 1n a game one is aware of some very chic 
basketball. . 

And Melvi~, who dribbles, passes, and shoots with complete calm and 
~asual~ess, hk~ he could play in his sleep, his shot floating to (he basket 
like a ~Ig soft ~1110~ that just sort of falls through the net, his betwee~theÂ­
leg dribble while directing UCSD's offense, his quick glance to his friends 
In the stands, is also very fashionable. 

Two different basketball players, Mitchell and Melvin. The common 
denominator is style. . 

r.be crowd sucked it up. They clapped. They hooted. They stomped 
theIr feet . They apparently loved it. 

â¢â¢â¢ 
But I am sure there are still a whole flock of non-believers Who can 

blame them? Exciting sports at uam. Pshaw! .

Staff Writer 
UC San Diego's women's swim 

team placed second in both A and B 
competition in Saturday's tn-meet 
with San Diego State University 
and Calirornia State University. 

Los Angeles, hosted by the San 
Diego State team. 

San Diego State. with clearly the 
strongest, most fully-rounded team 
of the three, took the A competition 
with UCSD 102-19 and the B 
competition 51-22. In UCSD-Cal 

State competition UCSD gained a 
62-15 win at the A revel and a 60-15 
win in theB. 

Most UCSD times were slower 
than usual. but there were a few 
surprises. CiCi Smith, swimming 
the 100 A breast stroke for the (jrst 
time rinished second while Laurel 
Erzinger took a third in the event. 
Both swimmers had very good 
personal times. Erzinger swam to 
a 2nd in the 50 A breast stroke as 
well. 

Kiki Nellis. taking a (jrst in the 
100 B free style competition 
dropped 2 seconds of( her previous 
best time to bring her down to 
1 :03.6. Nellis also placed 3rd in the 
50 B free style. 

The 200 B free relay, the final 
event at that level proved the 
closest of the afternoon. Both the 
Tritons and Aztecs were clocked at 
1 :57.3 but the judge's decision gave 
UCSD the victory. UCSD relay 
swimmers were Kiki Nellis, Uta 
Wilson, Laurel Erzinger and 
Deanna Duoos.

San Diego State swimmers 
showed strong performances the 
entire morning. Two of State's 
team members, Marilyn Silva and 
Toria Schlemmer qualified for 
national competition during the 
day's events. Silva, swinuning to a 
victory in the 50 A free style was 
clocked at 25:5 while SchJenuner 
qualified with a 30.0 win in the 50 A 
breast stroke. State has sent 
enough members for a relay team 
to the natiooaJs for the last four 
years, which will be held this year 
in March, in Florida. 

JV B-BaU Nips Navy to 
Raise Records, Spirits 

The UC San Diego junior varsity 
basketbaU team, playing with 
renewed spirit and detennination, 
came from behind last Saturday 
night to upset a talented club from 
North Island Naval Air Station, 90-
86. 

Combining a torrid 61% field 
goal shooting percentage with an 
improved man-~man defense, 
UCSD snapped a four game losing 
streak and raised their season 
record to 3-6. 

Along with the losing streak, the 
Tritons entered Saturday's contest 
having allowed over 100 points in 
each of their last two games. 
Defense, however, had not been the 
team's only problem. " Up to this 
week our motivation had not been 
very good," said Coach Ron Werft 
before the start of Saturday's 
game. " But the guys' attitudes 
reaUy improved. in practice this 
week. A 2-6 record is not something 
to be proud of. " 

Despite their aroused play, the 
Tritons needed some fine outside 
shooting by Doug Hafford and 
substitute guard Eric F.iAk:le to 
overtake North Island late in the 
second half. 

NI had built a seven point lead in 
the first half with some long-range

bombing and with the help of 19 
UCSD turnovers. 

Fighting back after in-
termission, the Tritons tied the 
score at 64-64 midway through the 
second half on one of Finkle's 
jumpers. Hafford and Finkle, with 
strong support from forwards Bob 
Peterson and Randy Meis, kept 
UCSD even until Doug's 2O-foot 
shot with only 40 seconds 
remaining on the game clock put 
the Tritons ahead for good. 

Hafford led all scores with a 
personal season high of 28 points. 
F inkle finished with 16 and Meis 15, 
both players hitting seven of nine 
shots from the floor. Peterson 
grabbed a team-high 11 rebounds 
to go along with his 12 points. 

UCSD coach Diana Dann 
commented on the day's swim-
ming, "We did alright. We' re 
starting into the heavy part of our 
schedule. I've been working the 
girls hard for the last week or so, 
building for the next week's." 

"We didn't really come here for 
the points, but rather for a lot of 
swimming. It was more of a 
preparation for the UCLAlWhittier 
meet in three weeks. Our times 
were a bit slower, but we were 
working a little more on some of 
our turns and starts. As we start 
tapering off we can concentrate 
more on the quality of our swim-
ming and the times." 

Surfers Get Three }"irsts 
Three Tt;itons came through with first place finishes and another had a 

second, as' UC San Diego was barely outscored by UC Santa Barbara in 
the intercollegiate surf contest last Sa~urday. 

The contest, held ~t Bl~ck 's Bea~Ii, involved the Tritons, along with 
UCSB, Cal State Uruverslty NorthrIdge, and Cal State University Long 
Beach. It was the first contest of 1976. 

In the nine heats, UCSD surfers finished first three times. Surf club 
president Rick Rodewald , Kim Fulton, and Clark Quinn had the thr;;; 
firsts. Mark Brolaski finished second in his heat. 

The high ~laces by the four.Tritons helped UCSD to 37 points, four less 
than champion UCSB. Northridge and Long Beaclfsurfers were held to 14 
total points each.

attended to because " our biggest 
problem is with the budget, and 
without any student input the 
university is slow to act. " 

Further adding to the Cluster 
Library problems is that during 
the academic year an average of 
20,000 individuals use the facility 
weekly, causing acute over-
crowding and hence excessive 
noise. 

Other improvements in the 
library system include the yearly 
addition of 68,000 volumes to the 
present 1,133,857 UCSD collection, 
this money has been approved by 
the State with the likelihood of an 
approval for 70,000 volumes per 
year. 

Security System Planned 
To insure that the books remain 

in the library, a new charge card 
system will be introduced in the 
fut ure alJowing book lending 
without the cumbersome paper 
work. A book security system is 
also planned, each book will 
contain a magnetic ribbon that will 
sound a warning when leaving the 
library. 

Inter-library loans have recently 
been opened to all undergraduate 
students, making it possible to 
obtain materials from libraries 
throughout the UC as well as other 
organizations. Along with this 
service the rec~tly inaugurated 
CLSS (computer literature 
searching service) enables all 

students and faculty access to a 
wide source of information in the 
field of literature. 

The library 's budgetary 
problems and the lack of space 
available continue to the 
lengthening of hours of service 
provided by the library, as weli as 
the books reserve'service used by 
many professors. 

Polish Mime ... 
through sexual symbols delivered 
with a wink. The erotic possibilities 
of the combination of mime and 
ballet are displayed only in 
Phylissa's tryst with Lodovic, the 
" romantic illusionist of lovers." 

Pbylissa's numerous sexual 
experiences become tiresome, 
because there is a sameness about 
her lovers, despite their different 
gimmicks. One cannot see how 
Phylissa developes as a result of 
her experiences. Though Phyllssa 
shows little development, she is 
engaging enough to hold the 
viewers' interest. One always feels 
sympathetic to Phyllssa even when 
she is willful and demanding 
because of her energy and in-
couciant charm. 

Though Phyllssa her lady in 
waiting were the obvious standouts 
in the cast, the supporting players 
showed themselves to be highly 
competent mimists and dancers. 

Hearings. .. 
approximately 20 seats fur 
designated observers have been 
allocated, Murphy said. 

One seat has been reserved for 
each provost and college council, 
the Graduate Student Council and 
the Student Cooperative. The 
Academic Senate has been al lotted 
two seats. 

Two seats are reserved for the 
Triton Times, five for the off-
campus press and an as yet un-
specified number for other UC San 
Diego journals.

one of a regular series of meetings 
on Thursday nights sponsored by 
NOW. 

The lecture consisted of a 25-
minute slide show covering a few 
television commercials and 100 
products from 31 magazines. The 
NOW spokeswoman said that they 
found most of these degrading to 
women because they assigned 
women to the role of housewife, 
mother or sex object. In addition, 
the slide show pointed out that the 
advertising industry was using the 
women's movement for its own 
purposes. A few examples NOW 
found to be complimentary to 
women were also covered, most of 
which were paid for by NOW. 

The meeting ended with a short 
question and answer period on 
what could be done to make the

wanna-be-taken-seriously-as-a-performer motif. Obviously taken aback 
by such ingratitude, Sammy lunged into a heartbreaking love duet with 
Joey ("that's the point! was getting at mama"). . 

Sammy then went into a ten-minute mullish monologue about his 
shortness, his two-hit repertoire, and his confession that he wished he 
didn't got to be he (ceptin what can he be cept what he am?) He abruptly 
broke into a visceral version of Chase's "Get It ON," flubbing his cues 
and forgetting the lyrics. Everytime Sammy has a spaz attack he breaks 
into a song. Even when he can't remember how it goes, it seems to have a 
therapeutic effect on him. -

Sammy's show has improved his guest appearances as well. On a 
recent Merv Griffin episode, Sam,stomped out on Griffin, Alan King, and 
Redd Foxx, daring them with a haughty "meet me backstage, white 
dudes." It has gotten to the point where he can always be e~pected to do 
something urunitigatedly embarrasing. 

He is the true original of our times, the first escapee from the asylum to 
succesfully capitalize on his origins.
