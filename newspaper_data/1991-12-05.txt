UCSD Student Credit Union 
Struggles to Remain Open 
• Although parent company announces closure, A.S., 
Student Credit Union and administration seek compromise 
Byo.nlWuu 
StJJff Writer 

Despite an announcement by the Uni-
versityandStaleEmployees(U.S.~)Credit 
Union thai it will discontinue its fmancial 
support of the Student Credit Union, the 
U.S.E. has not yet given an official written 
notice to the university concerning the 
closure. 

As a result, the Associated Students 
(AS.), the Student Credit Union, and the 
administration are in the process of negoti-
ating alternatives to closing with the U .S.E. 

"We're still negotiating [with U.S.E.) 
to keep the Student Credit Union open," 
said Doua Hutshings, one of the students 
who founded the Student Credit Union. 

"Even though U.S.E. has thought about 
closing [the Student Credit Union) , it hasn't 
been decided yet." 

At a meeting on Monday which in-
cluded A.S. council members, representa-
tives from the administration and Student 
Credit Union representatives, a list of con-
tractual adjustments to be proposed to 
U.S.E. was drawn up in order to continue 
operation of the UCSD Student Credit 
Union. 

Among the proposals made was the 
continuation of a student credit union space 
on campus. Another proposal was the em-
ployment of no fewer than six enrolled 
UCSD students and the establishment and

Ignores UCB 
Coop Resolution 
• UCB members believe they can review an 
administrative decision; Canuthers disagrees 
By ErIc Schmidt 
Associate News Editor 

The University Cen-
ter Board (UCB) passed 
a resolution on Monday 
attempting to halt Uni-
versity Center Director 
lim Canuthers from tak-
inganyadmini trativeac-
tion against Groundwork 
Books or any other stu-
dent cooperative without 
the board's consent. 

The resolution also 
mandates the fonnation 
of a joint committee of Jim Carruthers 
UCB representati ves and 
co-op members to reach a resolution on co-op issues. 

The resolution, authored by UCB Commissioner of Fi-
nance, Co-ops and Enterprise Chris Burnett, reprimands 
Carruthers for taking action against the co-ops without a 
UCB vote. 

At a Tuesday meeting, the Graduate Student Association 
(GSA) also voiced its support for the resolution. 

The day after the resolution was passed, Carruthers 
violated it by sending a letter to Groundwork ordering the 
signing of a new contract which make Groundwork an 
outside vendor by Dec. 20. 

Groundwork. according to Carruthers, will no longer be 
considered an agency account within the un.iversity. 

The new contract will double Groundwork 's rent and 
i~iately require a large bond on the order of$25,OOO, 
according to Groundwork co-op member Steve Dubb. 

"It's clearly a blatant abuse of [Carruthers'] authority, to 
send the letter the day after the resolution was passed," Dubb

• Parking prices may be one cause of San Diego Transit overload 
By PIIIIp MlchII'1 
Staff Writer 

As a result of the increase in the number 
of people using public transportation near 
UCSD, San Diego Transit buses have been 
unable to accommodate all passengers, in-
cluding many UCSD stu-
dents ttaveling to campus. 

The oven:rowding has 
occurred along the 34A bus 
line at the Via MaUorca/Via 
Alicante stop, between the 
hoursof8:30and 10:3OAM. 
This is • time when stu-
dents who live in the many 
condominiurncomplexes in 
thai area are trying to reach 
campus. resulting in major 
inconveniences for student 
bus riders. 

"It's almost like clockwork," said Muir 
CoUege senior Sylvia Thomas of the regular-
ity of crowding. According to Thomas, who 
has used public transportation fortluee years, 
the buses have never been overcrowded be-
fore. 

Patrick Riley, a Third College senior, has 
been left off the bus twice and is one of many 
students to be affected by the overcroWding. 

"It woukIn't be so bad, except for the last 
couple of times,l've had a sprained ankle. I 
usually walk.. .. said Riley. 

Greg Snce, a senior administration ana-

Iyst at Transportation Alternatives, said the 
problem has not gone unnoticed. 

"We are aware of the problem, and San 
Diego Transit is aware of the problem," 
Snee said. 

Transportation Alternatives, a division 
of the UCSD Parking 
Office, coordinates alter-
natives to driving to cam-
pus, including free San 
Diego Transit bus passes. 

Snee cited the cam-
pus parking situation as 
an explanation for this 
year's unprecedented in-
crease in the number of 
bus passengers. 

"It's probably because 
the system is actually be-

coming more successful. With the parking 
fee increase, students are looking for alter-
native means of transportation," he said. 

Transportation Alternatives and San 
Diego Transit became aware of the situa-
tion through the efforts of Thomas, who 
wrote two letters to the bus company alert-
ing them to the problem and proposing 
possible solutions. 

"Either [San Diego Transit) needs to 
add a bus, or [Transportation Alternatives] 
should make it another shuttle loop ... even 
if UCSD only ran it during the fifteen

said. 

Molly McKay, UCB chair, said. ".'m 
incredibly disgusted with the adrninistratiop' s 
heavy-handedness in this issue." 

Canuthers said during the UCB meeting 
that he did not intend to follow the UCB 
resolution, calling his decision administra-
tive. 

"The actions made [during November] 
are admini trative," he said. "When we find 
things that are inconsistent [with the UCSO 
Policy and Procedures Manual (PPM)]. we 
are not going to look the OIher way." 

On Nov. 18. Carruthers sent a letter to the 
UCB saying that. since Groundwork decided 
this quaner (0 contract its payroll through an 
outside agency. it would be considered out-
side the university system within 30 day . 

Canuthers said the action of Groundwork 
was in violation of the PPMs.1n addition. by 
choosing to route payroll through an outside 
agency. Groundwork had in essence made a 
decision to become completely autonomous. 

• n his Nov. 18 correspondence to the 
UCB. Canuthers also said the other co-ops 
were violating the PPMs through alleged 
"loans to employees. payment of wages out-
side the payroll system, cash advanCe to a 
university employee, mystery checks, and 
payment to vendors withoutdocumentation." 

Because of those violation . Carruthers 
said. the other co-ops would have to decide 
either to remain campus entities with on-
campus account or become contract vendors 
within 90 days. 

lOe other co-ops were thu offered the 
choice of losing autonomy to the university 
or gaining complete independence. 

According to Betsy Olson. a Groundwork 
co-op member. "[The admini tration] hasn't 
really been straight with us - it' . like a bomb 
that 's been dropped on us." 

Olson and Dubb said that. at the time the 
co-op decided to route their payroll through 
anoutsideentity. its members did not know it 
would cost them their on-campu tat us. 

"There's been no effort to say, 'Tnese are 
the policies you're violating· ... Olson said. 
adding that Carruthers did not inform Ground-

Tbc UCSD o.rdim 

work before issuing his uhimIIb.m to mnove 
them from the Wtiversity syaem. 

According to 01s0n, CmuIIas did noI 
even teU them which particular PPMs they 
were violating. 

Carruthers said, "With Groundwork, 
they've taken a direction simply by employ-
ing people [through the outside qaIC)' J. • 
pointed out that Groundwork ha been doing 
this since the begiMing of the fall quancr-
we were only informed, after repealed re-
quests, in November." 

Carruthers emphasized that the decision 
was beyond the range of the UCB' s authority. 
"Our administrative decision stands," he said. 
.. It's an administrative decision because the 
issue are administrative in nature. The PPMs 
are the university [not UCB] PPMs." 

UCB members, however, believed they 
could rule on the maner. McKay aid during 
the meeting. "( want to make it clear - ( 
expect that on Jan. 6, the co-ops will still be in 
the same stale as when we leave Saturday 
night." 

Dubbsaid, "I think it's rathetpatCrnalistic 
of (Carrulhers] to suggest that he can work on 
his own," since the UCB pays his salary • 

McKay~saying."He'snowa'daddy 
figure'. and we are little children that do not 
have any responsibility." 

McKay believes Canuthers' disregard for 
the resolution is '~USl pouring salt in the 
wounds." She also said it shows the long-
standing ho tility of the administration to-
ward Groundwork 

1lle issue of whether or not Carruthers is a 
UCB employee came up many times during 
Monday's meeting. Although many UCB 
members claimed he was their employee, 
Canuthers said repeatedly that he was a uni-
versity employee. not a UCB employee. 

Carruther's salary i a line item in the 
UCB-approved budget; however. Vice Chan-
cellor of Undergraduate Affairs Joseph 
Watson stated that Carruthers works for 
UCSD. not the UCB. 

"The Board is not his upervisor," said 
Watson. "They do not hire and fire him." 

Watson said that he understood the UCB 
position of wanting Carruthers to work with 
the UCB before taking action on the issue. 

McKay said the UCB does have some

~. __ ..-_ ... 'l'S 

control over Carruthers, since his salary is 
partially paid out of the $37.SO quanerfy fee 
that students pay for the university centers. 

The meeting became heatedjust before the 
vOle as co-op members and Carruthers fired 
statements back and forth. A co-op member 
said the issue may go to court. "Let's do it," 
Carruthers replied. 

Later, he said, "From our standpoint. it 
doesn't need to happen." 

Dubb said. in response to the idea of a legal 
confrontation. "I would hope it doesn't come 
to this." 

According to McKay. if Carruthers forces 
the issue, Groundwork and the other co-ops 
may have no recourse but to force a legal 
issue. "It is going to come to a head, obvi-
ously." she said. 

McKay added that the co-ops have a good 
chance of success in the legal scenario ....

think [the co-ops] have a very Sb'Ong case," 
she said. 

Denise Fenton, GSA representative to the 
UCB, said one reason why she voted against 
the resolution was because she hoped for 
more constructive dialogue instead of con-
frontation. ". think we had the opportunity to 
negotiate," she said. "The passage of the 
resolution closed that window." 

"The only thing ( would say now is that [ 
would think it's imperative for the co-ops to 
pursue dialogue," Fenton added. 

According to McKay, on the other hand, 
the confrontation is rooted in long-standing 
clashes between the administration and SlU-
dents. "The situation is severe enough that I 
think students in general feel it necessary to 
bring in other relevant issues that also have 
not received a clear-cut solution" from the 
administration, she said.

RuWn D&ria. a Third CoUege 
senior ..s former AssocilllCd Stu-
dents (A.S.) viccpresidenlldminis-
nive, has been selected • one of 
nine semifinaliSlS for the poIition of 
student regem, the sole sIUdenI vote 
on the Board of Regents. 

Dunin. UCSO's only semif.nal-
ist, will be interviCwcd in January 
by the University of Califomia Stu-
dent Association (UCSA), which 
will narrow the fJCld to dwe candi-
dates. 1bc Board of Regents then 
makes the final selection. 

Last year, Dunin was named one 
of the three student regent finalists 
but was not selected to be the stu-
dent regent. 

"The student regent presents the 
students' views on different levels 
and represents the students' views 
strongly," saidAguscin Orozco, A.S. 
president. 

Orozco and Graduate Student 
Association (GSA) President Denise 
Fenton made the first round of se-
lections on the campus level, based 
on written applications from UCSD. 
Then the nine semifmalists were 
chosen by a consortium of the A.S. 
and GSA presidents from all of the 
UC campuses following individual 
interviews with the candidales. 

".t is imperative that the person 
represents all students," Fenton said. 
".t is someone who doesn't have 
panisan affiliations." 

"He had proven himselfas a very 
qualified leader. It is good for our 
school to have a student regent who 
would understand San Diego stu-
dents' issues," said current Vice 

President Administrative Mike 
Holmes. 

"Dur60 is • very moCivaled per-
son. Once he starts on an issue, he 
does • aood job." Orou:o said. 

"His 1tnowJed8e of the issues 
will carry him a long way duoogh. 
He is weD-rounded on the issues 
and caD 100It at them from different 
perspectives," he continued 

OneofDunin's main concerns is 
the UC's budget. which is facing 
funhercurbacltsafterayearinwhich 
student fees increased 40 percent 

"WhIIcver solution the regents 
come up with, • would like to see 
that it does not adversely affect so 
many students, .. Duran said, explain-
ing that he opposes such ideas as the 
implementation of student tuition. 

Duran said he hopes that the UC 
can retain as much state funding as 
possible, and that long-term plans 
for growth in the form of additional 
campuses can be preserved. 

If selected, Duran said he would 
make an effort to be visible to the 
students so that the student regent 
can be used as a means of commu-
nication with the regents. 

"With a lack of access to the 
student regent. there follows a lack 
of access to the board," he said. 

Although he said the work of the 
student regent is limited, Dunin said 
he stiU believes the limitations of 
the position depend on how hard 
one works. 

". would like to take part in the 
decision-making that affects the 
entire system. As student regent you 
have the obligation to bring the stu-
dents' perspective before the board. 
I can see myself doing that from a 

RubAn DurAn Is one of nine semi-
finalists for UC student regent. 
broad student perspective, and with 
a certain amount of strength and 
honesty," he said. 

Since his first year at UCSD, 
when he served as Third College 
freshman senatorlo the A.S., Dunin 
has been actively involved in stu-
dent government. During his tenure 
as vice president administrative last 
year, Dunin said he gained "a good 
working knowledge of the issues 
affecting UCSD and its students." 

Dur4n added that he has learned 
"a broader range" of issues specific 
to both undergraduate and graduate 
students in his experience at UCSD, 
including his present position as a 
Third College resident advisor. 

..It is crucial to get someone who 
knows student issues andconcerns." 
Duran concluded. 

Of the nine semifinalists, another 
is UC Berkeley graduate student 
Alex Wong. a graduate of UCSD 
who also served as vice president 
administrative while he attended 
UCSD. 

The article "Recycling Co-op Works with PPS to Find a Home-
(Dec. 2) contained several errors. The Recycling Co-op is not 
creating the campus planning committee to oversee the creation 
of a permanent recycling site; campus Planning is creating that 
committee with Recycling Co-op representation. 

PPS Director Jack Hug will meet with the Chancelior's Council 
in December to discuss recycling. not just with Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson. 

Campus Planning. not Chancellor Atkinson. must deSignate 
the permanent recycling yard site. 

Physical Plant Services has not fully taken over paper recycling 
from the Co-op. Each performs about 40 percent of the total paper 
recycling on campus. with the other 20 percent controlled by 
Housing Services. 

The Guardian regrets these errors.

• A look back at a year of war, peace, 
scandal, controversy and revolution - a year 

full of sound and fury, signifying nothing 
By PhIlp Mlchll •• , StlJff wnter 

J 99 J was one of those years which 
had everything, but in the long run ended 
up saying nothing. The year had history-
making moments up the gazoo, but when 
it came time to analyze the lasting effects 
oflhose moments, 199I,like a well-trained 
politician, kept answering "I'll have to get 
back to you on that." 

0.1111: enough oil to draw the attention of the rest of the world. We went to war with 
Iraq for three main reasons: the 
liberation of Kuwait, the protection of 
our economic interests in hopes of 
putting an end to a crippling recession 
and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein 
(who took over the "Menacing 
Foreigner of the Year" title from 
Manuel Noriega). 

This year has given US 
a sizeable number of 
events which could fill 
up 8nJ history book -

It was like when you were five years 
old and had just finished fingerpainting on 
the kitchen wall. "Wait 'til your father 
gets home," Mom would always scream. 
Well,l991 hasjustfini hedfingerpainting 
the entire house, only it looks like Dad 
isn 't coming home any time soon. 

that's what scholars

you ask those same 
schoIa's what these 
events mean for the 
future, }OJ'II get a lot 

Well. .. one out of three isn't bad. 
The war gave everyone what they

ber of events which could fill up any

,blank stares 

us, anyway. But if you ask those same scholars what these 
events mean for the future, you'll get a lot of head-
scratching and blank stares. When it comes down to the 
ultimate historical meaning of 1991, nobody has a clue. 

Ignoring the Jimmy Swaggarrs, David Dukes and 
Jeffrey Dahmers who pop up every year, make a lot of 
noise and then leave quietly, the major stories of 1991 are 
s~lar in dial not one seems conclusive in any way. A war 
was ended, but peace is stiD out of reach.. The dceIh knell 
for communism was sounded this summer, but the Eastern 
bloc COWltries seem in a grearer sbIle of chaos than before. 
The words "definitive" and 1991 in no way joined hands 
and waltzed merrily off info history. All we bave to show 
for this year is some big news SIOries and some bigger 
questions. 

THE GULF WAR: Our COWlIry fought in a war earlier 
Ibis year. Don't feel bad if you've fcqoaen III IIbout it. 
Most of the people who waged it probably have, too. Just 
to refresh your memory. the hubbub was over a counay 
dial most Americans can't find on a map. but produced 

pmty weapons on CNN, and Saddam 
Hussein got to remain in power. Yes. there was some-
thing for everyone - except, of course, for the Iraqi 
citizens. who were bombed, fiJ'Sl by the UN fon:es and 
then by Hussein. There were other negative aspects to the 
Gulf War, namely Whitney Houston's comeback. And 
there's no way on earth that could be good for humanity. 

The war also made George Bush the most beloved 
U.S. president in history,. least unlil his own inenia 
broupl him t.ck down to e8I1h.. For most of 1991, BUIh 
had a viltUal stranaJehold on the opinion polls, until the 
populace began to notice the adrninistntion', domestic 
policy: "Ignore it and hope that it goes away." And by the 
end of 199I,Ihat's whaI Bush's popularity did.

White MaIe." (Monday, ~ 2) 
!be flaws are piled biJh, and the 
mi" ... .,.. are exceeded in 
depee only by the paIroOiz.ina 
lODe. 

Mr. Conway erects and rails 
apiDIIa &b'aw man (&b'aW per-
lOll?), The auack itself rends 10-
ward the ad IJomUwm (album) 
variely, "suburban world," 
"Wonderbread-Disneyland vi-
sion," "arrogant white men, Of 
"sorry bunch of guys, .... a pitiable 
buDcb, .. etc. It becomes "increas-
ingly easier (sic)" to see thai Mr. 
Conway is motivated by a hatred 
of mainstream culture rather than 
high-minded justice. 

Mr. Conway decrees, "II is a 
sad objectivity indeed thai would 
disIUow the telling ... of bow Na-
tiveAmericans were not saved by 
Kevin Costner." The suggestion 
of this clwosy doublc-neptive is 
Ihat mainstream Amerikkka ~ 
lieves that Kevin Costner saved 
the natives. This is so wrong in so 
many ways that an explanation 
wouIdbenefit Mr. Conway solely. 

He belittles the maneuverings 
of the Left and multiculturalists, 
then devises the White Male ~ 
geym&n- What is imidious about 
this is Ihat terms like "Leftist" and 
"multiculturalist .. refer to those 
who espouse certain ideas. Using 
"White Male, "hecleaveshuman-
ity and evenly peppers an entire 
portion willi a rancid belief sys-
tem. Mr. Conway, whiffing the 
ranIt odor of the hairs he seared 
venturina too close to racism, al-
lows for the existence of 'white 
men' who are above White Male 
philosophy. Isn't this equiValent 
to comments like "sure, not nlery 
Asian is good at math"? 

To observe the "myth of the 
supremacy of the individual over 
COIIIIIIUIIity" shows a yearning to 
avoidreaponsibility, which is fur-
ther evidenced by a claim to an 
unIudty trauma. It is unfonunaJe 
for Mr. Conway that he was "in-
doc:trioaIed into fearin& African-
American and Laboo neighbor-
hoods. " That would be a terrible 
infellectual setbadt for anyone: a 
blow that would require years of 
pIayiDa phiIoeqIbicaI calcb-up.

refer to the allegations that Mama

not chair the Culture Quest festi-
val becaasethey are white. Orozco 
isquocal.sayioa that there would 
'be tenaion between the two sides 
because Riser and Roberts are 
white, and the groups in Culaure 
Quat are not. This qUOte demon-
mares Orozco's bipolar view of 
aw:e relations. 

II appears that he believes it is 
a oonfIOOIaIiooaI case of "us ver-

UCB ChaIr CIdes BoIId's 
Role In CoGp Debate 
Editor: 

I am writing this letter to s0-
lidify and clarify my position, as 
University Center Board chair, 

~arding the current "Adminis-
trative Action" taken against the 
coops. I find it unaccepcable that 
the UCB, thus far. has been left 
out of the loop. This is not the 
correct way to go about dealing 
with the co-ops. 

F'1J'St, I would like to air my 
concerns regarding certain UCB 
staff -:- and Director Jim 
Carruthers in panicular - talting 
steps that notonly do not originate 
from the UCB, but that seem to 
exclude it on issues which most 
gravely concern it and its relations 
withtheco-ops. We do not wish to 
setaprecedentofthedirector lead-
ingthe board rather than vice versa, 
as the UCB pays his salary. 

It is not clear, in my mind, that 
Canuthers is a university em-
ployee dim:dy. If he is, it is only 
byvinueofthe UCB. The chain of 
responsibility to the depaItmenl 
of undergraduate affairs should 
reflect Ihis.It is the UCB which is 
responsible for- the co-ops and, 
therefore, has the greatest stake in 
their sound business practices and 
secwity. TherefoR, the adminis-
trative 8CIion taken by the UCB 
director should not exclude the 
board's participation in the ~ 
lution of this issue. The UCB 
should be the determining body 
whic:b judps whether or DOC an 
adequaae solution is given to the · 
aIIeJCd problems with Ihe oo-opI 
UCB financial siIUaIion. 

Asc:blir,ldonot ra:ognillC the 
30 or the 9O-day deadline • sec 
fortb, DOl' _the boan1 made any 
decision Ibal such u1timaIums are 
neceuary at Ibis time. 

In my opinion, il is the resp0n-
sibility of the UCB to: I) clearly 
delioeatr any and all allepd vio-
laaionaofthePPMs; 2) make all of 
the infunlMion gathered by their 
ofIicea available in lteroxed form 
10 all of the coopi; 3) give lllges-
tiona of bow theie malIa'I are to 
be raoIved within abe current 
opeIIIIinJ IIrUI:IUre; and 4) offer 
complete coopenIion in helping 
the COoOpI RID eft'ectively wiIbin 

the university system without com-
promising their collective style of 
running business. 

Once this infOlTTlalion is given to 
the co-ops. they must be given ad-
equate time to review the documents, 
research all availableoptions and bring 
a proposal to the UCB for approval. 

Until these guidelines are satis- . 
fied, any action taken by the admin-
istration in regard to the coops will 
beseenasanac:tofaggressionagainst 
students. Such action could warrant 
the immediate review of all involved 
UCB staff members' employment 
by the board. 

The co-ops provide a wonderful 
experience for students and generate 
a feeling of empowennent that must 
not be compromised or dismantled. 

This situation can be res'Olved to 
the satisfaction of all involved par-
ties if mutual respect, patience and 
rational dialogue prevails. I suggest 
a series of round tables to be con-
ducted throughout winter quarter to 
answer questions about co-op pr0-
posals once the above steps have 
been taken to ensure that the coOp 
status is clearandsecure in the minds 
of all parties. 

For documentation purposes, 
progress on this issue should be con-
tinu.uy substantiated from all sides. 

I look forward to a salisfac:tory 
resolution to the current UCB/co-
opIadministralion conflict.

"If any solution is 10 come, it 
mUSl come from the university," 
said Carmen Sandoval of San 01-
ego Transit 

The proposal to add anocber bus 
line hu met wilh some opposilion, 
particularly from San Diego Tran-
sit Critics of the plan have deemed 
it economically infeasible. . 

"At this point. we aren't pre-
pared to add another bus [on the 
34A route). It would be too costly 
and [the Via Mallorca stop] is the 
only stop impacted:' said Sandoval. 

"It's alfl105t too much to ask [San 
Diego Transit) to run another bus 
every fifteen minutes because after 
this loop, it's not justified," Riley 
said. 

The current contract between the 
university and San Diego Transit is 
in its final year. When negotiation 
of the new contract begins, solu-
tions to the overcrowding problem 
wiU be discussed, 

"In January of 1992. we're going 
to be siRing down and discussing if 
we're going to make any changes in 
the system," Snce said 

Snce suggested that students 
should try to use altemate bus routes. 

"I don't know if people can pick 
and choose their schedules. There 
realJy are no short-term solutions 
for the next few months, OCher than 
to let students know we're aware of 
the situation, and we're looting for 
a solution," said Snce.

ideaofhirn buying one. When Kelly 
did get a motorcycle, at the begin-
ning of Ibis quarter, he did not tell 
his parents. 

Lumby also said that Kelly did 
1101 own a helmet. "He didn't have 
the money to buy a helmet, so he 
kept putting it off," she said. 

"He really liked life, and I'm not 
just saying that because he's gone:' 
Lumby said 

Lumby described Kelly as hav-
ing a love for music and dancing. 
"He was a really good dancer -
everyone used to tease him about 
it." she said.

According to Lumby, Kelly, an 
electrical engineering major, also 
took an interest in reading phiJoso.. 
phy and often played basketball. 
80laris added that Kelly had talked 
about wanting to travel and see the 
world 

"It's tough. He hadalotoffiiends. 
and everyone takes care of each

Since services for Kelly were

A Time to 

• The 199,1 fall quarter marked one of the most 
successful periods in tbe history of the UCSD athletic 
program. As the year winds down, we pause to take a 
look back at the moments which cal,lght our attention,

championships for the second time 
and finished sixth.

UCSD to be excited about 85 J8IOII "Tuttle" 
Brown was selected to the AIl-TOUI1I8IDeIIt team 
last weekend, an honor rarely bestowed on 
Division m players. 

"It's just amazing," said UCSD Head Coach 
Denny Harper. "We're all really proud of it" 

UCSD, which fmishcd the season with a m:ord 
of 23-18, entered last weekend's tournament at 
Belmont Plaza seeded sixth. The scedings were 
true to fonn as UCSD lost to UCLA 14-10 in the

MEN ' S SOCCER

UCSD won its second title in four 

years by downing Trenton State 1-0 
in front of a raucous home crowd.

"We came this far. 

We weren't going to let 
it go in the end," said 
UCSD fullback Mike 
Gerbardt 

How else to explain a 
men '5 soccer team that 
was given up for dead at 
the beginning of the 
year'! 

Adversity never 
knew a better friend. 
The Tritons lost forward 
Ryan Nutting in the first 
five minutes of the 
season to compound 
fractures of the tibia and the fibia. They opened the year 3· 
3, the program's worst stan in nine years. Midfielders 
Mike Lodoen and Janet Stevenson each missed Significant 
chunks of playing time at the beginning of the year 
because of injuries, and l.odoen would eventually miss the 
final four because of a pulled hamstring. 

The offense, too, was hamstrung throughout most of 
the year, totaling a meager 43 goals in 18~ . 

But through it all, the defense shined. And, with its

fifth time in six years.

Remember the UCSD women's soccer 

team •. . the squad that was dominating 
opponents all year and went to the final four in 
Plymouth, New Hampshire with a 15-1-2 
record, ranked third nationally, and confident 
thai it would win the national championship. 

Well, a school named Ithaca College got in 
the way of the Tritons' title hopes as it downed 
UCSD 1-0 in the semifinals. The Bombers 
were the defending national champions, and 
they dropped a mighty bomb on the high-
powered Triton offense.

The women's volleyball team £aeed 
Washington in a rematch oflast 
year's final, but this time came 

away on the losing end 
., an ....... AssocIlIte Spotta Editor 

What at first appeared 10 be a season in which die 
UCSD women's volleyball am would capture its 
sevc:ntb national title in II years ended up falling one 
pneshort. 

The Tritons, behind a high-powered offense and a 
solid defense, dominated Division m opponents 
throughout die year. 

On offense, UCSD was led by FJizabeth Tan, 
Vitti VM Duyne, and liz Vesanovic. Stacie Sasaki 
gave the Tritons depIh off die bench, and Julie Fabian 
set up the offensive aaack. Defensively, Dana Simone 
emesged as one of the top players in the nation, 

~ abe TrilOnS 10 an undefeated regular-season 
recooI apimt Division m oppooenls. 

Fwthennore, after UCSD won the Northeast 
Regional in Rochester, New York, Ibe Tritons had 
only lost one game (not a match) to Division m learnS 
all year and won 4S. 

The only game the Tritons,lost came in the first 
match of the season against Menlo, when they were 
up two games to none and the reserve players were in 
during garbage time. 

The nationals took UCSD back to the same spot in 
which it had won the national champiOMhip the year 
before - Washington University in St. Louis, 
Missouri. 

In the semifinal match against Juniata, die Tritons 
played what Head Coach Doug Dannevik called 
"maybe the best match we've played all year," 
downing die Indians in three straight games IS-6. IS-

championship 
match agiUnsl 
dleWahing· 
tonBcars, 
given the fact 
that the Tritons 
had beaten the 
Bears the year 
before on 
Washington's 
home court to 
win the title. 

But this 
year, it just 
wasn't meant 
to be. 

UCSD 
came out shaky and could never pull it together. 
"We started so poorly. It was our worst passing job 
aU year," Dannevik said 

The Tritons dropped the title match to Washing-
ton in five games 14-16.15-6,9-15,15-13, 154, and 
ended the year with a 26-6 ~ 

Although they feU short of their staled goal, the 
year did bring honors to several Tritons. 

UCSD was vel)' well·represented on the AU-
West Region team, with five of the six top vote-
getters being from UCSD. Tan received the most 
votes. followed by Fabian, Simone, Van Duyne and 
Heather Holtzclaw. But, because of NCAA regula-
tions that limit onJy three players from one team to 
making All-Region, Van Duyne and Holtzclaw were 
left out. 

Tan was also named Division m Player of the 
Year.

collective back to the wall. UCSD 
closed out the year I~I-l. Then 
came die NCAA tournament. And 
everything that the Tritons were 
during the regular season, they 
Wem1't during die playoffs. The 
offense exploded for II goals in 
three games. The defense cracked 
worse than the Berlin Wall, flood-
ing its own net with seven goals. 

But die TritOM held steady. The 
turning point was a second-round 
game against the University ofWis-
consin-Oshkosh in which the two 
teams exchanged leads for ties four 
times. Goalie Michael Madden had 
a horrible game, the lowlight of 
which was a 45-yard floater that he 
misjudged and allowed to fly over 
his head. The hannJess free kick 
knotted the game at three, and left 
Madden as the prime candidate for 
the goat's outfit. 

But, in a microcosm of UCSD's 
season, he would fight back to play 
the role of hero. The two teams 
played through 120 minutes of soc-
cer, and then headed for penalty 
kicks. On UWO's founh kick, 
midfietder Mark Pawlyshyn drilled 
a shot hard into the right comer. 

Madden dove. and with his right 
hand. slapped the ball away -
perhaps the biggest save in the his-
tol)' of the men's soccer program. 

But this fairy tale would not be

complete unJess the TritOM had to 
knock off the big, bad bully. And 
they did - two in fact, in the final 
four. rtrst up was Ohio Wesleyan, 
the No.1 team in the country, and a 
fmalist the year before when it lost 
to Glassboro State . . 

The defense stiffened and re-
turned to its regular-season fonn, 
shutting out one of the most explo-
siveanddiverseoffenses in the tour· 
nament. UCSD's lone goal came on 
a penalty kick by Mike Albe.rts after 
(luis Hanssen was tripped. 

The two would pair up once again 
in the final against Trenton State-
a match made for revenge if there 
ever was one. It was against the 
Lions in the first game of the year 
that Nutting had broken his leg on a 
particularly hard - though legal-
slide tackle. 

In the 55th minute, Alberts took 
a pass from Brian Bradbul)' off a 
restart and whacked a cross into the 
center of the box. From 10 yards 
out, Hanssen lined a shot off the leg 
of keeper Mike Rentrier that rico-
cheted high into the air and then fell 
softly into the net. 

That was all the Tritons would 
need. With the support of a vocifer-
ous home crowd that rode the Tren-
ton State players mercilessly, the 
defense completely shut down the 
highest scoring team in the final 
four. In the process. UCSD nailed 
down its second national champi-
onship in four years.

fltSt round and dropped into the 
losers' brackcc. 

The Tritons came roaring t.ck 
to bear Slippery Rock 12-9 before 
taking on Long Beach Scare for the 
consolation tide. 

Butthe4gers won 12-lOtoclaim 
fi fth place. 

The announcement of Brown to 
the AU-Tournament team helped 
easesomeofUCSO'spWn. ''TunJc's 
seleclion definitely took some of 
the sting out of the loss," Harper 
said. 

W.SOCCER 
ContInued from PICe 9 
with midfielder Kalyn Shea com-
bined for 42 goals this year, the 
Tritons had managed to score 65 
times in just 18 games. 

But against the Bombers, the 
Tritonscould manage only fiveshots 
the entire game. And Ithaca goal-
keeper Beth Howlanddidn 't have to 
make a save all day. 

Although UCSO's bid for a sec-
ond national championship in three 

L.JCSEI 
HClC)KS' ()Ht-

1991 was a complete turnarOUnd 
from last year when the Tritons 
stumbled before losing in the 
WWPA roumamenL But. Harper 
said, this year, he is completely sat-
isfied. 

One reason. he said, i$thaI UCSO 
has begun 10 establish itself as a 
force in future NCAA tounwnents 
and will be a contender for years to 
come. ''Teams know that when they 
play UCSO they have to be ready," 
he said. 

Despite preseason anxiety by 
some who felt that UCSO wouldn't 
be able to pull together its highly-
talented - but inexperienced -

years fell shon, it was still a year 
worthy of appreciation. 

First off, UCSO lost only one 
game throughout the entire regular 
season, and that was to Cal State 
Dominguez Hills. which went on to 
win the Oivision 0 national cham-
pionship. 

Secondly, the Tritons recorded 
II shutouts in the regular season 
and two more in the West Regional. 
In fact, the Tritons allowed only one 
shot on goal in the two games com-
bined. 

The UCSD Guardian 

team, the Trilons RICOVend forlheir 
second berth in three years. 

The rcd-shirtinS of senion Grea 
Goodrich end Brown in 1990 peid 
off • .x:orcIinItoHarper. Thllmove, 
mixed with a few surprises -
Il8IIICly freshman Mike Nalu -
vaulted the Tritons into the nation's 
elite. 

"Nalu was a pleasant surprise," 
said Harper of his young saar. "We 
knew we had a real gem, bull never 
thought he'd have the stats he did. 

"Overall it wasjusu great year," 
he said. ''The NCAA is going to get 
used to having a team like UCSO 
around. " 

Perhaps most notably, however, 
the Tritons fought through a virtual 
rosterofinjuries. Sophomores Katie 
Larkin and Heather Sears, and se-
nior Danielle Placek, all of whom 
were at one point starters, were ide-
lined. 

And then sophomore defender 
Jayrnie Bradford was lost for the 
season when she tore ligaments in 
her knee in a scrimmage against 
BYU . 

But UCSD kept roUing. Until it 
faced Ithaca.

SIaIb Records 
It is truly unazing that some 

binds get signed and release an al-
bum. Even more incredible is when 
a famous producer gets involved 
and the finished product is distrib-
uted by a greallabel, but the bind 
and album are very mediocre and 
banal. 

The UCSD Guardiml 

Cue in point is Tribe. a bind out 
of Boston, whole debut RIIionaI 
relcase,Abon,wMproduccdbyGii 
Norton (the Pixies) and is on Slash 
Records. SIasb !lied to have IOIIle 
of the most inventive punk t.nds of 
theearty '801, but now it ha .. tooped 
to the Iowesc level. 

Tribe is nola bad bend. RIIhc:r, 
it 's predictable IIId it triea to cover 
everythins from the Coctcau Twins 
to Siouxsie. Those are JOOd influ-
ences to wodt with, but Norton and 

Slash Records should have heeded 
the title. 

Tribe's version of a1lem1livepop 
isn't very caIdIy or moving. The 
music jusa hanp 1heIe, and like a 
Paula Abdulaune, it aoea away until 
the next listening. The musicians in 
Tribe are good. They are a very tight 
t.Id, bur they don't try 10 blow 
away their audience. 

The inIapIay of guitar and syn-
lhesizas is unique. but Tribe fails to 
take it to • new pIareau. Instead of 

creaaing songs that take its influ-
ences one step further, it has failed 
at trying to duplicale its heroes. 

Two songs are somewhat ap-
pealing and will probably make it 
0l1IO 91 X. "Here at the Horne" is a 
concerted effon to imitale their fel-
low Bostonians, the Pixies. "Out-
side" meshes classic Siouxsie and 
the Banshees with a touch of Enya. 

To get a taSIe of the modem 
Boston scene, bypass Tribe and go

Thunday, December 5,1991 The UCSD Guardian 

• Graduate professor Jorge Huerta pioneers a theater for everyone 
IIyWlleenWOIW 
As5«iate Hiatus Editor 

Growing up in East L.A. as a 
Chicano was not eay for UCSD 
graduate theater professor and the-
ater pioneer, Jorge Huerta He felt 
that being Mexican was something 
a peMD couldn't be proud of. He 
admitted, thai as a youm, he thought 
of himself as being white. In high 
school, Huena said he was always 
doing white theater sunounded by 
white students because that was all 
a peMD could find in high school 
theater departments. 

As a child, people would con-
stantly remind him of who or what 
he was supposed to be and constant-
ly ask him what he was and where 
he came from. 

"All my life people would say 
'What are you?' and r d put them on 
the spot and say, ' What do you 
mean what am 11 Do you think I'm 
a lettuce, a tomato?'" said Huena 
with a chuckle. "All of my youth, 
being Mexican was a dirty word. To 
be a paser was to be a stereotype 
- the same as Hollywood portrays 
us today." 

While attending college, Huerta 
was exposed to EI Teatro 
Campesino, a thealernoupecre8ted 
by Luis Valdez. Valdez staned the 
theater company in 1965 to address 
the problems faced by Hispanic 
workers in the United SlateS. Val-
dez recruited farm workers to be 
actors for perfonnances in the fields 
of Central California. 

The encounter with Valdez 
sparked an interest in Huena for 
theater that addressed his commu-
nity. "It was my understanding that 
there was a community out there 
that I could serve that wasn' t being 
5erved, and it was because I saw my 
people on stage performing in our 

language. a mixture of Spanish and 
English," Huerta said. 

Huerta became involved in pr0-
moting Hispanic theater after he 
had gone back to graduate school. 
His first effon was the fonnation of 
Teatro de la Esperanza in Santa 
Barbara. 

After graduating from UCSB in 
1974 - when Huerta became the 
flJ'St Chicano to get a Ph.D. in!he-
ater - he moved to San Diego and 
began his career as a professor at 
UCSD. He became an active partic-
ipant in many of the community 
theaters in San Diego, including the 
Old Globe and the San Diego Rep-
enory 1beater. 

TIJeater experts say that Huena 

" I [was] naive to think that 
these students would be 
satisfied to have second 
best. That time is over. 

" JORGE HlERTA Theater professor 
is anexpen in Chicano theater and is 
thekey to its movement in thiscoun· 
try. Some even accredit him as be-
ing the founder of Chicano theater. 
Huerta admitted that he and Valdez 
are the two oldest people in the 
movement- but not the founders .. 

"Some people wiD introduce me 
as the founder of Oticaoo theater, 
which is not true, I dido't 'found' it 
lfLuis Valdez founded it, then I'm 
theGodfather. He was the one in the 
tre{lChes, initially. and I was the one 
at the university," Huena said. 

At UCSD, Huena has become 

the administralor of the first bilin· 
gual MFA theater arts program in 
the U.S. It is a graduate program in 
Hispanic theater that staned four 
years ago. 'The program is made up 
of eight actors and two directors, 
whose backgrounds range from 
Olicano to Pueno Rican to Argen-
tinean. 

Though Huenaaccepted thechal-
lenge of heading such a program, he 
did not see the potential problems 
that have plagued it Huerta thought 
the graduate program would be "sep-
arate but equal." The only problem, 
according to Huerta, is that there is 
OQequal. 

Only two fellowships were of-
fered to 10 students. The other the-
ater program is getting much more 
than the bilingual theater program. 
1bere are no facilities and no staff 
support. In retrospect, Huerta says 
thai the program was poorly planned 
-andthebudgetcutsthisyearhave 
not helped the program either. 

Huerta blames himself for not 
having the foresight in predicting 
the unfortunate outcome of the pro-
gram. "I [was] naive to think that

WINTER MOVIE GUIDE 

of the 
Along with ho-hum holiday flicks and reruns on the tube 
comes a parade of equally ho-hum movie releases from 
Hollywood's stu~ios. As a season of money-losing movies 
comes to a close, it seems as if the year will wrap with a 
disappointing collection of regurgitated casts and 

storylines. So if you've been looking forward to hitting the movie 
theaters during Winter Break, you may want to change your plans and 
rent some classics at the video store instead. But if you're still 
determined to slap down $7 for a movie at a theater, there are a few 
films that look like they may show some promise ... very few films. 

Preyle •• It, Jen., 41.1 •••• A •• ocl.te HI.t •• Editor 

t "Star Trek VI: The Undlscoyered Country" Paramount Pictures, (Dee.6) 
Yes ... it's yet QlIOlh~r Star Trek 

movie. You would think that the cast and crew 
would've learned their lesson after "Star Trek V: 
The Final Frontier" was beamed into oblivion in 
1989. But nevertheless, Captain James T. Kirit 
(William Shatner) and Mr. Spock (Leonard 
Nimoy) are back to battle the bad guys, hopefully, 
for the last time. 

The return of lhe original cast (James Doohan 
as Scotty, George Takei as Sulu, and DeForrest 
Kelley as Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy), and the 
added talents of Christopher pfummer, Kim 
Caurall, lman and Michael Dom may be enough 
to lead the Federalion to an inevitable victory over 
Ihe evil Klingon Empire, but it will take more 
than pointy ears, matching unifonns and stale 
Stardate entries to save this film. Talented 
craftspersons and technicians will undoubtedly 
paint a pretty picture, but for how long will 
audiences be sAtisfied with space-age sets and 
special effects when the cast looks so tired? 

A sizeable box office gross can be expected 
during opening week, but after the faithful 
"trekkies" have had their fill, this movie will 
probably warp speed out of the tbeaten to make 
way for more deserving films . 

...... y" t Tri-Star Pictures, (Dec. 20) Director Barry Levinsoo ("Rainman", "Avalon") tells the story of the binh of 
Las Vegas by chronicling the life of 

the charismatic gangster Ben "Bugsy" Siegal 
(Warren Beatty). Focusing upon his relationship 
with starlet Virginia Hill (Annette Bening), the 
movie highlights his dream of building a 
gambling kingdom. Inspired by Hill, Bugsy tums 
his dream into a reality by building the Hotel 
Aamingo (so called after his nickrwne for Hill), 
the first luxury casino in Vegas. 

t "The PrInce of TIdes" Columbia Pictures, (Dec. 25) Pat Conroy's best-selling novel The Prillc~ o/Tides will come to life in 
tbeaters this holiday season via 

producer/director/star Barbra Streisand. Taking on 
the role of the wounded healer, Streisand ponrays 
Susan Lowenstein, a New Yorit psychiatrist who, 
with the help of Tom Winao, (Nick Nolte. who 
can also be seen in the recent thriller "Cape 
Fear"), pieces together the brilliantly psychotic 
history of the self-destructive Wingo family of 
South Carolina. 

1bose who have read the novel know why The 
PrillU o/Tidts sold over two million copies; tbe 
narrative is a beautifully woven tapestry of 
violence and revelation. Conroy also pens the 
screenplay, which should comfort his fans, but 
one always wonders whether the movie will be as 
good as the book. 

If her past works, ("Yentl," "FUMY Girl," '"The 
Way We Were"), build any precedence, then 
Streisand's stab al bringing this piece to the big 
screen should hil lhe target, or al least come preny 
close to it. 

t "Hook" Tri-Star Pictures, (Dec. 11) This fantasy-adventure stars Robin Williams as the grown-up Peler Pan, 
who returns to Neverland to face his 

arcb-enemy, Captain Hook (Oustin Hoffman). 
This time, Peter Pan must rescue his children from 
Hook's evil clutches by recovering the spirit and 
imagination he once possessed as "\he boy who 
wouIdn't grow up," because apparently, by the 
size of him, he has. 

Evolved from the characters created by J.M . 
Barrie and directed by Steven Speilberg, "Hook" 
also stars Julia Robens as the fairy Tinkerbell 
and Bob Hoskins as Hook's sidekick. 

"The a..t Boy Scout" t Warner Brothers. (Dec. 13) You won't be watching Ihis one because of the plot, because there isn't 
much of one. Bruce Willis is back as 

Joe Hallenbeck in a "Die Hardn_type role where 
he's a tough detective looking for the bad guys. 
People get killed, things explode, and tbere's a lot 
of gunfire. If you're looking for a hard-hitting 
action-packed thriller, then you've found it. In 
fact, if you're looking for a remake of "Lethal 
Weapon," "48 Hours," and "Beverly Hills Cop" 
all rolled up in one, then you've found that, too. If 
you can stop laughing when you realize Ihat 
Hallenbeck's partner James Dix (Damon Wayans) 
is "Homey lhe Clown" from Fox's "In Living 
Color', then you just may enjoy this film. 

t "The Inner Circle" Columbia Pictures, (Dec. 25) Filmed within the Kremlin walls, a first for a major motion picture, "The 
Inner Circle" slars Tom Hulce (best 

known for his role as Mozan in "Amadeus', as 
Ivan Sanshin, a loyal Soviet citizen who becomes 
pan of Stalin's inner circle when he is pressed 
inlo service as Slalin's personal projectionist. 
Sanshin faces struggles with both himself and his 
.marriage, ironically finding weakness in his 
actions despite his being in such close pro)l;imity 
to power. Scenes are also shot inside the KGB 
headquaners and the Soviet Red Army's war 
college. 

t "JFK" Warner Brothers, (Dec. 20) Academy Award-winner Oliver Stone joins fon:es with Kevin Costner and an 
all-slar cast 10 bring Ihis suspense 

drama to the screen. Costner is Jim Garrison, the 
New Orleans district attorney who raises lhe 
nation's suspicions concerning the assassination 
of President John F. Kennedy. The film recaptures 
the doubts, upheaval and mystery surrounding the 
murder. With Sissy Spacek, Walter Mallhau, Ed 
Asner, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon and John 
Larroquette, this could be the one that sweeps the 
box office.

McErtaine fits in with such greats as

The musicianship is truly amazing. 
EddieCampbell's sirnplekeyboards 
augment the somber tune5 and spice

What makes the sound complete 
is Sharleen Spiteri's powerful and 
ethereal voice. She brings the lis-
tener into her heart and bares her 
soul. NO( many vocalists have that 
talent, and Spiteri makes full use of 
her gift. 

Texas is a slow, intense band. 
Every song is incredible in its own 
way. "This WiU All Be Mine"dwells 
on the demise of a relationship based 

on mind games. McErlaine's dis-
toned solo and Johnny McElhone's 
bass set the scene of despair and 
contempt. 

The songs on MOIhers Heaven 
not only deal with receiving pain, 
but they also focus on anger, re-
venge, and deceit. Spiteri is not in-
nocent, and she seems very proud of 
the fact. 

"Beliefs" and the tille track are 
the two true rock and roll songs, but 
they still surprise the listener be-
cause of their originality. It is easy 
to hear how Texas has been influ-
enced, but the mesh of so many 
styles has corne together to create a 
totally unique sound.

like just another college-oriented 
alternative-music group. But 
Bandwagonesque is hardly an ob-
scurerecord-afterall, it was named 
record of the year by Spill maga-
zine. 

This isn't lO say that Spill maga-
zine isa trustworthy source for music 
knowledge - but in this case, it 
certainly hits the ballpark. 
Bandwagonesque's 12 songs con-
tain entrancing pop songs laced with 
perplexing lyrics and plenty of 
feedbacking guitars. 

TIle songs are a strange combi-
nation of the Bealles, Badfinger, 
and even the Eagles, but with an 
alternative-style edge that brings to 
mind Bob Mould and Husker Oil. as 
well as more traditional pop acts 
like Marshall Crenshaw and 

HIATUS H7 

Crowded House. 
The album's best song is 

"Alcoholiday," which showcases 
the almost-ambivalent pessimism 
that pervades the album. As the song 
says, 'There are things I want to dol 
but I doo't know if they will be with 
you/Went to bed, but I 'm not readyl 
Baby, I've been rucked already." 

TIle serious of "Alcoholiday" is 
nicely balanced by the hilarious 
Heavy Metal tale in "Metal Baby," 
as well as the loud and obnoxious 
(like you couldn't tell it from the 
title) ··Satan." 

Teenage Fanclub's melodies are 
as pleasing as its lyrics are strange. 
Either way, Bandwagol/C'sqllC' cer-
tainly belongs among the year'sbest 
albums.

What we assume to be human nature is often highly suspect. 
In reality, the concept is largely misunderstood and misap-
plied, varying remarkably from one historical and cultural per-
spective to another. In a revealing and unique course this win-
ter, Professor Emeritus Robert Livingston and a host of expert 
guest lecturers analyze what it is to be a globally responsible 
human being while examining human nature with respect to 
its potential fitness for survival. Students delve Into the very 
origins of humanity, analyzing the evolution of the human 
brain and its functions, including sensory processing, per-
ception, visceratlon, expression, and effectuation. Participants 
also examine global cooperation and conflict while studying 
cultural diversity among world views. Lively and enlightening 
discussions help students discover, analyze, and explain the 
range and diversity of human perception, judgment, and be-
havior. Join us In January on an unforgettable voyage of self-
discovery. Complimentary enrollment is available for regiS-
tered UCSD students.

Willlim Vin:his. a colleague of 15 
years. 

Huerca says that the department 
will no longer have a seperare His-
panic program. Instead, the whole 
depanment will be multicultural. 
UCSD has been one of the most 
successful graduate proarams in 
California at getting fellowships. In 
ocher words, UCSD is most suc-
cessful at brinatng in people who 
are underrepresented. This doesn'l 
mean a complete elimination of the 
Hispanic PI'08f1U1l; it means expos-
ing the students in the program to 
things that they will never get in 
ocher graduaIe programs. 

"What we decided to do is go 
into the whole multicultura1 realm 
[We will have] a class of actors nexi 
year that will be representative of 
the multicultural or the multi~ 
nicity of our stale. To me, multicul-
tural means everything - it does" 't 
exclude white people, it includes us 
along with them. 

"People are still calling me about 
the Hispanic program. What I'm 
going 10 try to do is lure them here in 
understanding that it's going to be a 
multicuilUral program. I much pre-
fer that We've got to get together," 
Huerta said. 

The Teatro Mascara Magica. a 
theater company created by both 
Huerta and Vin:his, is now going 
through many of the same changes. 
The theater p1ans to integrate the 
African-American, Asian and His-
panic theater communities togeth-
er. Huerta expressed that though he 
loves 10 address and deal with jusl 
Hispaniclheater, he also loves know-
ing and learning aboul other cul-
tures as well. 

Professionally, Huerta is most 
proud of his students. Education 
brings great satisfaction to Huerta. 
When asked what the professor/di-
rector hoped to get out of everything 
he's done, he laughed and replied, 
"I'm gonna go to heaven, that's 
what lieU people. The only thing 
you get out of teaching is heaven, 
and great satisfaction. I have stu-
dents allover the country doing 
theater. When I go to these theater 
things-Hispanic theaterthings-
I look up there and I see the one in 
charge of that show was a student of 
minein'78,andthatoneoverthere ... 
I have made my contribution to a 
movement" 

The one thing Huerta c1airns to 
do weU is teach. Though he loves 
teaching his Hispanic theater class, 
he also enjoys teaching his class on 
tragedy writing, which is a much 
larger class and includes all kinds of 
students - not just theater majors.

encing young people and I'm very
