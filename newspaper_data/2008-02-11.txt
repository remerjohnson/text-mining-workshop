the United States “for the American Dream” and is well- 
respected in San Diego’s Korean-American community.

However, both victims described their attacker as an 
Asian male who smoked cigarettes, and the DNA obtained 
from the crime scenes matched Baek’s, according to Mónica 
Muñoz, a spokeswoman for the San Diego Police Department. 
The jurors deliberated for about a day before finding Baek 
guilty on seven of the nine charges, but were unable to reach 
a verdict on two charges of attempted burglary.

“His crimes showed an escalating pattern of violence, and 
what his next step was going to be, nobody knows,” Means 
said. “He is a serial rapist of the scariest type.”

In the months following the rapes, police swabbed the 
mouth of any individual fitting the suspect’s description. 
In December 2006, another University City woman heard 
noises in the bushes outside her window one night and called 
the police. When the police arrived at the scene they chased 
and caught Baek. He was placed under surveillance until the 
results of the DNA test linked him to both rapes, leading to

As many UCSD premed stu-
dents  prepare to graduate and enter 
medical school, a realm of new 
experiences and challenges awaits 
them. Yet these students’ medical 
school experiences come at a price 
— almost $130,000 in educational 
bills, according to a report by the 
Association of American Medical 
Colleges. 

Studies suggest that medical 
schools’ escalating tuition fees and 
the subsequent debt that students 
accumulate influence the specialty 
they choose upon graduation. The 
cost of tuition fees and health insur-
ance has risen from last year at 
UCSD’s School of Medicine: The fees 
for 2007-08 are $22,959 for residents 
and $35,204 for non residents. 

The nationwide increase in 
tuition fees is sparking concerns due 
to the adverse effects on students and 
patients, according to recent data 
released by the American Medical 
Association. The AMA suggests that 
there have been correlations between 
debt and students’ choices, and how 
those decisions in turn have come to 
harm the health-care system. Such

A UCSD committee will soon 
decide if ancient remains found on 
campus property show evidence 
of cultural affiliation to the local 
Kumeyaay American Indian tribe, 
the first step to ending a decades-
long dispute over the remains’ own-
ership and final resting place. 

The two skeletons in question 
were discovered during an arche-
ological dig at University House, 
the historic UCSD chancellor’s res-
idence, in 1976. Since that time, 
the remains have been held at the 
Museum of Man, the Smithsonian 
Institution and the San Diego 
Archaeological Center. 

Gail Kennedy, a UCLA anthro-
pology professor, was part of the 
archeology class that first unearthed 
the remains over 30 years ago. The 
archeologists uncovered an older 
woman and a younger man buried 
in a very interesting ritual, in which 
the man had part of his fingers cut 
off and put in his mouth, Kennedy 

said. The skeletons were dated to 
about 8,350 before present, making 
them around 10,000 years old.

A long dispute has ensued 
between archeologists and 
Kumeyaay tribe members, who 
want the remains returned to them 
so they can be properly reburied.

“We have a very strict religion 
on handling and burying remains,” 
said Steve Banegas, spokesman for 
the Kumeyaay Cultural Repatriation 
Committee, founded in 1997. “We 
treat them as if they are loved ones or 
family members and rebury them. It’s 
a very intensive and long process.”

The federal Native American 
Graves Protection and Repatriation 
Act of 1990 requires that institu-
tions receiving federal funding 
return American Indian cultural 
items and human remains to their 
respective tribes. Under this act, 
local Kumeyaay Indians must prove 
to the UCSD NAGPRA Working 
Group that the remains indeed 
belong to their tribe. 

UCSD anthropology profes-
sor  and committee Chair Margaret 
J. Schoeninger said members will 
make their decision based on evi-
dence in the following categories: 
geography, kinship, biology, archae-
ology, linguistics, folklore, oral tra-
dition and history.

A 40-year old San Diego travel agent was convicted on 
Feb. 7 for sexually assaulting two UCSD medical students in 
2005 and 2006.

Teddy Baek, dubbed the “Asian male smoker rapist” by 
members of the media, faces multiple life sentences for convic-
tions on seven charges, including multiple counts of forced 
rape. The sentencing will occur on March 14.

The attacks, which happened nine months apart in 
University City, both took place in the early morning during 
finals week. Baek entered by removing a window screen and 
climbing into the victims’ apartments through the open win-
dow while they slept. The victims were then blindfolded, and 
the second victim testified that her attacker pressed a metallic 
object against her cheek.

“The similarities between all the attacks were so extraor-
dinarily unique that there was only one conclusion,” said 
Deputy District Attorney Gretchen Means, who prosecuted 
Baek. “It was a very solid case.”

Means said that Baek had a “particular type of female 
that he seemed to like,” as the victims were all young Asian-
American UCSD students.

Baek’s defense attorney, Marc Carlos, argued that there 
were not enough links between the two cases to prove Baek’s 
guilt and that the victims had conflicting physical descrip-
tions. One of the victims told police that her attacker had a 
Japanese accent, and a weapon was involved in only one of 
the rapes.

Baek, who owns the “Travel-Land” agency in Kearny 
Mesa, emigrated from Korea in 1991. He lives in Carmel 
Valley and is currently married with two children. Carlos 
described him as a hard-working immigrant who came to

Despite outcries from students offended by Revelle College Semiformal’s Asian theme “Eastern Elegance: 
A Night in the Orient,” advertisements  for the event remained posted on campus as recently as Feb. 10.  

Revelle Committee Apologizes 
for Contested Dance Theme

By Connie Shieh
Staff Writer

After the theme of this year’s Revelle 
College semiformal was revealed to 
be “Eastern Elegance: A Night in the 
Orient,” the Semiformal Committee 
and Revelle College Council have been 
criticized for approving and funding 
the event, which some student groups 
have labeled offensive and culturally 
insensitive.

After months of brainstorming, the 

Semiformal Committee planned for an 
Asian theme this year, complete with 
fans, silk cherry blossom decorations, 
a performance by UCSD’s Japanese 
drumming group Asayake Taiko and 
chopstick party favors.

Three weeks ago, RCC approved 
nearly $7,000 of partial funding to the 
event without any discussion of how 
the dance theme might be received. 
The event made its debut on Facebook

correlations include unsafe physician 
behavior and a decrease in primary-
care physicians and in diversity of 
the physician workforce. 

The AMA said that residents 
who carry the high debt burdens are 
more likely to assume an additional 
job. This can lead to fatigue, which 
in turn can breed medical errors. 
Also, high debt becomes a barrier 
for many low-income and minority 
students. Furthermore, the increase 
in debt among students can pressure 
them to pursue higher-paid special-
ties.

likely to pursue family practice and

gested by a 2007 report by physi-
cian-staffing firm Merritt, Hawkins

ners are earning. According to the

New Minor to Focus on 
European Studies

Beginning Spring Quarter 2008, 
UCSD will offer a European studies 
minor program highlighting Europe’s 
political and economic expansion, 
as well as broader issues of national 
identity.

Other minor topics include 
Europe’s Enlightenment, immigration, 
Islam, the European Constitution, 
new forms of communication and 
art, the politics of fear, terror and 
democracy and Europe’s relations 
with the United States.

Professor of French studies and 
cultural studies and European studies 
minor Faculty Director Roddey Reid 
said the program is ideal for students 
interested in a career in foreign ser-
vice or nongovernmental organiza-
tions. He added that those pursuing 
law, biomedical research, medicine, 
business or those who wish to study 
aboad in Europe will also find the 
program especially beneficial.

‘Love Hormone’ Could 
Help Psychiatric Patients

School of Medicine researchers 
are currently experimenting to deter-
mine whether a hormone triggered by 
physical contact could help patients 
with schizophrenia, social anxiety and 
other disorders.

Oxytocin, a brain chemical 
released during hugging and other 
physical contact, plays a major role in 
parent-infant and male-female bonds, 
UCSD assistant clinical professor 
of psychiatry Kai MacDonald said. 
Research suggests that the chemical 
alters the firing of the amygdala — the 

part of the brain that processes emo-
tional stimuli — resulting in changes in 
the brain signals that enable recogni-
tion of facial expressions.

MacDonald said that oxytocin 
may play a critical role in human 
social behavior.

“Oxytocin is sometimes called the 
‘love hormone,’” he said. “We know 
that the eye-to-eye communication 
— which is affected by oxytocin —is 
critical to intimate emotional commu-
nication for all kinds of emotions — 
love, fear, trust, anxiety.” He added 
that individuals with schizophrenia 
or autism often struggle with social 
contact because they avoid eye con-
tact and focus on less relevant parts 
of the face.

Also known as Pitocin, the hor-
mone has long been used to induce 
labor and lactation in women; how-
ever, research regarding its effects 
on the brain has been limited. UCSD 
researchers believe that oxytocin 
could increase levels of trust, generos-
ity and emotional contact for patients 
with schizophrenia or anxiety. 

The hormone reduces the activ-
ity of brain circuits related to fear 
and increases the patient’s level of 
eye contact, and MacDonald said 
that although people seem to act 
differently, they historically have not 
reported feeling different at all. He 
said it is clear that the “love hor-
mone” affects brain activity, but that 
researchers have yet to confirm the 
chemical’s effects on human interac-
tions.

“A hug or a touch that causes 
a release of this hormone might 
change brain signals,” MacDonald 
said. “We want to know if oxytocin 
can also impact social and emotional 
behavior in patients with psychiatric 
disorders.”

Schoeninger said the objective 
of the UCSD NAGPRA Working 
Group is to review all the evidence 
before preparing a recommenda-
tion to Vice Chancellor of Research 
Arthur B. Ellis.

However, Banegas said the 
Kumeyaay are offended that they 
are even being asked to prove infor-
mation they feel is well-known. The 
Kumeyaay presented cultural songs, 
stories, maps and history at a Jan. 24 
meeting to show their ancient ties to 
the La Jolla area.

KCRC and the NAGPRA 
Working Group have met three 
times during this academic year. At 
the latest meeting on Jan. 24, held at 
the Barona Community Center, the 
committee reported on the status of 
its deliberations and the KCRC pre-
sented information about the tribe’s 
history.

“We are hopeful that ongoing dis-
cussions with interested parties and 
state agencies will result in a project 
that is sensitive to both university 
needs and concerns expressed by 
members of the community,” UCSD 
spokeswoman Dolores Davies said.

Banegas, however, said he was 
dissatisfied with the meetings.

“I had this belief that at an insti-
tution of higher learning they would 

his arrest.
It is unknown why Baek’s victims 

were UCSD students, or whether the 
pattern was even intentional, accord-
ing to Means. UCSD does not have a 
very high rate of sex crimes on cam-
pus. According to UCSD’s Clery Report, 
a federally mandated compilation of 
crimes occurring on or around universi-
ty campuses, there were six instances of 

sexual offenses with the use of force on 
and directly adjacent to campus in 2004 
and 2005, and two in 2006. Most rapes 
are committed by someone known by 
the victim, making Baek’s crimes par-
ticularly threatening, Means said.

“He represented a unique predator, 
which made him very dangerous,” she said.

Though Carlos said during the trial 
that Baek was innocent and that there 
was still a rapist on the loose, the city 

police department expressed satisfac-
tion with the conviction.

“We are extremely pleased with 
the outcome of this case,” Muñoz 
said. “It is a testament to the excel-
lent work of our officers, detec-
tives and also the district attorney’s 
office staff who worked on the case.”

Committee Aims for Spring-Quarter Resolution
▶ ARTIFACTS, from page 1 have been more open and there 

would have been a more diverse 
group of people who would meet 
to learn and understand,” he said. 
“There’s so much here that the com-
mittee refuses to hear or that they 
don’t want to hear. The decent thing 
to do is to treat these remains as 
respected human beings. We’re try-

ing to right the wrong that’s been 
done for the last 20 to 30 years. We 
look forward to the day of meeting 
with sincere people as equals.”

The Kumeyaay have also 
expressed concern about the pro-
posed demolition of University 
House, which since 2004 has been 
deemed unlivable. The residence 
was nominated for a position on the 

National Register of Historic Places 
in November.

Resting atop an ancient  American 
Indian burial ground and built in 
the unique “pueblo revival” style, 
the property is viewed by historians 
as archeologically and historically 
important.

“Our goal is to have a University 
House that both meets our chancel-
lor’s residential needs and our pro-
grammatic needs and supports our 
relationships with the community,” 
Davies said.

The plans for the repatriation 
will continue to move forward 
regardless of the University House 
project, she added.

Schoeninger said the committee 
hopes to make a recommendation 
to Ellis by the beginning of Spring 
Quarter. The recommendation will 
then be transferred to the University 
of California’s NAGPRA Advisory 
Committee, which will approve or 
reject it.

“The final decision is made by

Office of the President,” Schoeninger 
said. “We are hopeful that will be 
made during the summer at the 
very latest.”

Junie Chea, a member of the Asian 
Pacific Islander Student Alliance and 
Student Promoted Access Center for 
Education and Service. 

A coalition of students arrived at 
the RCC meeting on Feb. 5 to share 
their feelings about the Asian-themed 
dance.

In addition to problems with the 
dance’s name, members of the pub-
lic pointed out that the decorations 
and food do not showcase an accurate 
representation of the diversity within 
Asian cultures. Instead, students felt 
that the cultures represented were pri-
marily Chinese and Japanese, despite 

the fact that “Asian” and “Orient” are 
terms that encompass a multitude of 
distinct cultures and ethnicities.

Many present at the meeting sug-
gested that the root of the problem lies 
predominantly in the lack of awareness 
of Asian Pacific-Islander history, which 
if known, would have prevented the 
creation of a social event that upset 
many within UCSD’s API community. 

“The fact that such a large amount 
of people let this bypass them, without 
knowing that it was a harmful state-
ment, shows that maybe we aren’t as 
culturally aware as we’d like to think,” 
Revelle Semiformal Committee co-
Chair Alicia Zuniga said.

At the same meeting, the co-chairs 
of the Revelle Semiformal Committee 

a week later and has since received so 
much criticism that the details of the 
event  — including the theme — were 
removed by the committee co-chairs 
shortly after.

The controversial term “Orient” 
was popularly used in the age of colo-
nialism to refer to places and people in 
East Asia in relation to Europe, and is  
considered a Eurocentric term within 
some Asian communities.

However, “Orient” has been a prob-
lematic term for the committee because 
it is not considered universally objec-
tionable. Many Asian Americans on 
Revelle’s Semiformal Committee and 
college council said they do not find the 
word offensive.

“We personally were not offended 
by the semiformal theme, but now 
recognize that there are members of 
the UCSD community who feel differ-
ently,” Revelle Semiformal Committee 
co-Advisers Janice Lew and Erica 
Okamura said in an e-mail. “In no 
way was there any intention to offend 
anyone.”

However, Cathlene Yapyuco, a 
Thurgood Marshall College alumna 
and staff member at the Cross-Cultural 
Center, said she was particularly 
shocked when she noticed the event 
on Facebook.

“Even though I know that Asian-
American issues are still very much 
invisible these days, it was still sur-
prising to hear that the word ‘Orient’ 
was used in a title of a dance,” said 
Yapyuco, a former A.S. councilmem-
ber. “It was even more upsetting to see 
on the Facebook page where the term 
‘ghetto geisha’ was used to advertise 
the event.”

Yapyuco was not the only person to 
express surprise at the event’s approval.

“What bothered me the most [is] 
that it has been approved by Revelle 
College and that no one ever thought 
that other people might find it offen-
sive,” said Thurgood Marshall senior

aware as we’d like to think.”

— Alicia Zuniga, co-Chair, Revelle 
College Semiformal Committee

produced a formal apology to the Asian 
Pacific-Islander and UCSD communi-
ties.

“We picked an Asian-style theme 
because we felt that the cultural aspects 
were beautiful and should be shared 
with the Revelle community,” co-Chair 
Allison Potter said. “If anyone had 
mentioned that the theme or title could 
be offensive in any way we would have 
discussed the matter and stricken any 
elements that would be offensive. We 
were truly unaware of this.”

The following day, Revelle College 
Senator Sonia Chokshi sent an apologet-
ic e-mail to the A.S. Council addressing 
the issue. Chokshi outlined the prob-
lems regarding the dance, as well as pos-
sible solutions to replan the event. 

To ameliorate the situation, the 
planning committee will collaborate 
with members of S.P.A.C.E.S. and the 
Student Affirmative Action Committee 
to implement necessary changes and 
compromise on aspects of the event. 

The Revelle Semiformal is still set 
to take place on March 7, though the 
name of the event has been changed to 
“Sakura Night,” or “Night of the Cherry 
Blossom.” The details of the event, such 
as food and decorations, will not be 
finalized until further discussion with 
student groups. The planning commit-
tee will have to go before the college 
council once more to approve any dras-
tic changes made to the budget.

RCC plans to be more involved in 
community events and with groups 
such as SAAC to avoid similar situations 
in the future, according to Chokshi.

“It is unfortunate that our impact on 
the community was not the same as our 
intent, but the silver lining to this situa-
tion is that we can use it as a first step in 
raising public awareness of the negative 
connotations words like ‘Orient’ and 
‘Eastern’ have when referring to the 
API community,” Zuniga said.

Cyclists 
Should Lose 
the Attitude, 
Find the Law

What’s up with bicyclists on the road? Now before I lose all 
of you health- and environment-
minded people, let me be the first 
to admit biking’s awesomeness. 
It’s healthy, saves the planet and is 
more efficient than walking. 

And I can definitely understand 
how cyclists could get frustrated 
with bad drivers, prompting criti-
cal-mass-type events and a general 
share-the-road attitude. 

It’s true: Many drivers are care-
less, and without much more than 
a plastic helmet for protection, 
cyclists have extra reason to be sus-
picious and resentful. 

The problem is that this fair 
frustration has a tendency to lead 
to a holier-than-thou mentality that 
ends up harming cyclists more than 
anything. 

How often have you seen some-
one biking two feet to the left of the 
clearly marked bike lane? 

Cars stack up behind Mr. 
Spandex Shorts as he moves five 
miles an hour stubbornly proclaim-
ing, “I am a vehicle too and the road 
must be shared!”

But rather than consider his 
plight, and the plight of the other 
800 UCSD affiliates who bike to 
campus each day, all drivers behind 
him are thinking is, “Man, that 
guy’s an asshole.”

And I don’t think they’re neces-
sarily wrong. 

What is Mr. Spandex Shorts 
gaining by ignoring the bike lane in 
favor of the road? This is something 
I see every day as a driver, bus rider, 
pedestrian and cyclist. No matter 
what mode of transportation I’m 
using, it’s clear to me that most 
cyclists are harming, not helping, 
their cause. By blatantly disregard-
ing the bike lane, they’re just deep-
ening the distrust between cars and 
bikes, making drivers resent them 
and putting themselves in very real 
danger.

But that’s not all cyclists do 
to stab themselves in the cleated 
foot. Another example of this self-
destructive attitude at work, which 
is arguably more dangerous, is when 
cyclists pull up to a red light where 
cars are stopped but go ahead any-
way. The hypocrisy here is mind-
boggling.

How can cyclists preach about 
being treated as equals, but then act 
as though major traffic laws don’t 
apply to them? Not only is this 
common ignore-the-red-light prac-
tice illegal, it’s pretty annoying to 
drivers who come across that same 
rule breaker later, stubbornly bik-
ing down the middle of their lane. 
Again, this kind of arrogance harms 
only the cyclists themselves, as they 
offend law-abiding drivers and put 
their own safety at risk. 

You catch more flies with honey 
than you do with vinegar. And the 
way cyclists should convince driv-
ers that they, too, own a share of 
the road certainly isn’t by recklessly 
stealing it.

ON CAMPUS — It’s no surprise 
that residential security officers are 
the same as ever, despite a year-old 
report analyzing the RSO program. 

The report, which was commis-
sioned by former Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Joseph W. Watson 
during Fall Quarter 2006, essentially 
suggested that improving the rela-
tionship between students and RSOs 
could reduce underage alcohol con-

sumption on campus. 
But when Watson retired in June 

2007, the movement to re-evalu-
ate the program left with him, and 
rightfully so. 

It would be a 
complete waste to 
spend time and 
money on addi-
tional reports to 
bridge the gap 
between stu-
dents and RSOs. 
Watson’s original 
hypothesis that 
greater amity 
between the stu-
dent body and 
campus security 
would cut down 
on illegal drinking is ridiculous. 

Did Watson honestly think that 
if students were less intimidated 

by RSOs they would simply refrain 
from taking part in illegal activi-
ties out of respect for their new 
“friends”? 

RSOs exist in some form at all UC 
campuses, where 
they enforce rules 
and provide secu-
rity and safety. 

On a cam-
pus like UCSD’s, 
where the crime 
rate is hardly com-
parable to that of 
South Central Los 
Angeles, the main 
activity that RSOs 
report are cases of 
underage drink-
ing. Students are 

well aware of the university’s policies 
on illegal substances and knowingly 
partake in these activities regardless 

of these rules. 
For that reason, students must be 

held accountable if they are caught 
red-cup-handed and subsequently 
cannot blame RSOs for simply doing 
their job.

It was one thing to hope that 
most students respect RSOs and the 
vital role that they play in campus 
life, but to desire a better relation-
ship between the two groups is ide-
alistic at best. 

In a perfect world, students 
would follow all campus rules and 
never create a situation that neces-
sitates RSO involvement, but in real-
ity students are going to break the 
rules and those who are not sneaky 
enough to slip through the cracks 
are going to get caught. 

And when this happens, it’s 

RSOs Designed to Regulate, Not Congregate, With Students

See RSO, page 5

“It would be a complete waste to spend time and money on further reports in an effort to 
bridge the gap between 

students and RSOs.”

Stealing
the Shoes

The university’s lack of 
progress after last year’s 
residential security 
officer program report 
is a blessing in disguise.

By Hadley Mendoza
Senior Staff Writer 

STUDENT LIFE — A glimmer of 
free speech illuminated UCSD’s 
bleakly restrictive scenery on Jan. 
31, as student representatives from 
the free-speech policy revision com-
mittee released an updated policy 
proposal. And things were looking 
pretty promising until word of the 
University Centers Advisory Board’s 
own Price Center-governing speech 
policy promptly extinguished that 
flicker.

The trouble first started last 
spring, when university administra-
tors pumped out a draconian policy 
during finals week. Luckily, once stu-
dents looked up from their books, 
they were able to successfully protest 
the changes, and a committee was 
formed to review the policies. The 
committee, which has met extensive-
ly with various on-campus groups 
including the A.S. Council, has now 
presented a vaguely overarching solu-
tion that reads more like a wide-eyed 

mission statement — the document 
even includes a preamble. But while 
the new proposal is a vast improve-
ment, it fails to specifically answer 
the original question: What protected 
speech rights do students have? 

In comes the new UCAB policy, 
which coupled with an already-exist-
ing section in the student conduct 
code, creates tempting loopholes for 
administrators trying to circumvent 
the new proposal. In order to truly 
protect constitutional rights, the 
committee needs to directly address 
and integrate these other documents. 
While committee members have said 
their policy will supercede all others, 
its vague language isn’t promising. 

Carol-Irene Southworth, the 
A.S. representative to the commit-
tee, said the group purposely chose 
broad wording in order to protect 
students’ rights. But by being inten-
tionally unspecific, the committee is 
knowingly opening its policy up for 
administrative abuse. With some-
thing as important as freedom at 
stake there is no room for question, 
and it is the committee’s duty to 
present the most airtight document 
possible. 

It’s clear from their shady actions 
last year regarding free speech that 

UCSD administrators are just look-
ing for ways to thwart student free-
dom, and this is why the new UCAB 
policy must be addressed immedi-
ately. Without repealing the Price 
Center Plaza Limited Forum Policy, 
students’ rights are not protected in 
the place they are most likely to con-
gregate — the very heart of campus.

Apparently, we can’t even trust 
our fellow students to come up with 
an appropriate policy that will protect 
our rights. UCAB, comprised largely 
of undergraduates, proved to be just 
as underhanded as university offi-
cials when it ignored student protests 
against the original administrative 
rewrite, and passed its own equally 
oppressive Price Center policy in the 
face of the revision committee.

UCAB members such as Arian 
Mashhood and Vice Chair Lana 
Blank felt their policy was suitable 
because they didn’t like having to 
hear people yell about their ideas 
during lunch. 

“We feel like Price Center is for 
UCSD, not just anyone,” Blank told 
the Guardian.

Forget for a moment that the 
board’s restrictive policy does, in 
fact, limit UCSD affiliates — Blank’s 
assertion still is dead wrong. UCSD 
is a public institution and its grounds 
are public space. Perhaps a look at 
the recent court case affecting the 
nearby Fashion Valley Mall will help 
clear up any misunderstandings — in 
a similar debate where mall officials 

wanted to regulate protestors, the 
California Supreme Court ruled that 
mall space, though privately owned, 
was a space for the public, and thus 
the court upheld free speech.

UCAB’s Price Center policy out-
laws, among other things, “public 
speaking activities that generate 
excessive noise,” but fails to explain 
what qualifies as excessive. It puts 
an end to student protests, crushes 
impromptu gatherings — better get 
that reservation! — and even has the 
capacity to ban boisterous students 
from the plaza. This infringement 
upon freedom of speech and assem-
bly was approved without question 
by a board featuring many of UCSD’s 
student leaders.

And all this comes in spite of 
the progress made by the revision 
committee. Though new-proposal 
advocates like Southworth should be 
applauded for their effort to reform 
the spring 2007 policy and protect 
students’ rights, they shouldn’t be 
content yet. Addressing the UCAB 
policy should be the committee’s 
foremost concern in its attempt 
streamline speech policies and sup-
port freedom.

The bottom line is that students 
need to keep a watchful eye on not 
only administrators but also other 
students — if we don’t protect our 
rights, no one else will.

HUMANITIES

understandable for students to 
hold a certain amount of animosity 
toward the officers. But this anger 
is actually positive; it strengthens 
the separation between student and 
officer, which is necessary for stu-
dents to respect the authority of 
RSOs and, for the most part, adhere 
to UC rules and bylaws. 

If UCSD administrators really 
want their student body to be bosom 
buddies with RSOs, they can look at 
how private universities form their 
campus security teams. 

At Stanford University, the resi-
dential advisers and residential secu-
rity advisers are more like watchdogs 
than police; instead of keeping stu-
dents from drinking alcohol, they 
are there to make sure that kids do 
not get sick or get into serious trou-
ble. The fact that freshmen living on 
campus at Stanford are permitted 
to drink represents a big difference 
between private and public universi-
ties, and is often one of the reasons 
that students choose to attend the 
former. 

If administrators want to mini-

mize RSOs’ intimidating persona, 
they should expand on their idea of 
giving the officers new uniforms and 
distribute Hawaiian T-shirts for offi-
cial use on duty. The idea of an RSO 
patrolling residence halls wearing a 
brightly colored, leis-printed shirt 
is just as ludicrous as the thought of 
UCSD creating a positive connection 
between the officers and students. 

But if administrators want to 
ensure that students respect the 
school rules and behave themselves, 
officials must make an effort to 
emphasize RSOs’ authority on cam-

pus. 
Right now RSOs want to con-

tinue doing their job and enforcing 
the rules, but at the same time they 
want students to see them in a more 
positive light. 

Simply put, UCSD wants to have 
its cake and eat it, too. But the uni-
versity must realize that a second 
RSO report would accomplish noth-
ing and would only end up creating 
more hostility between students and 
officers. 

Bringing the unfortunate realities 
of the student-RSO relationship to 

light would make RSOs more frus-
trated with being disliked and cause 
students to be even more aware of 
the ever-looming security presence 
on campus. If UCSD truly cares 
about maintaining its desired level 
of safety and enforcement, it must 
come to terms with the fact that 
RSOs and students need a divide 
between them and that each must 
be allowed to play its specific role 
on campus.

ON CAMPUS — Physical and recre-
ational activities serve as a vital com-
ponent to a student’s well-being. It 
makes sense, then, that UCSD offers 
a variety of recreational classes. 

But unlike other University of 
California campuses such as UC 
Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz and UC 
Santa Barbara, which advocate their 
recreational classes by awarding 
units without added expense, stu-
dents in La Jolla unfairly have to 
pay — in many ways — to pursue 
similar activities. 

So if a student’s recreational 
activity is such an important aspect 
of this university, and other simi-
lar universities do so, why doesn’t 
UCSD allow units for students 

who take advantage of recreational 
opportunities? 

In order to participate in an 
activity of particular interest, UCSD 
students are required to pay fees 
ranging from $40 to nearly $300. 
They are then forced to take time 
out of their schedules to attend these 
classes, purely out of satisfaction 
and interest in learning. Thus, stu-
dents are left with merely an option 
to be active; there is no administra-
tive incentive.

Admittedly, offering units for 
recreational activities would require 
a physical education department 
that would need to review and 
reform the existing courses to meet 
its standards. According to admin-
istrative records, such a department 
existed from 1975 to 1994, but was 
discontinued due to the universi-
ty administration’s lack of “a clear 
understanding of the department’s 
role in the university’s mission and 
its distinctness from the roles of 
the departments of recreation and 
athletics.” 

But a lack of understanding on 
the part of administrators shouldn’t 
supplant the student’s right to earn 

credit for learning. Students should 
be granted units for work they 
do and instruction they receive, 
regardless of the specific depart-
ment. Furthermore, UCSD has a 
dance department that gives stu-
dents credit for its classes, which are 
recreational in nature. In order to 
standardize the school’s educational 
goals and the UC system’s practices, 
similar units should be awarded for 
similar activities. 

According to UC Berkeley’s 
physical education department Web 
site, the university offers a variety of 
instructional as well as performance 
courses in sequence to “develop 
and improve performance skills, 
to impart knowledge and concepts 
relevant to the activity, to intro-
duce information concerning the 
fitness and health benefits of regu-
lar exercise and to help students to 
develop and maintain physical fit-
ness” — all without additional cost. 
These courses are treated as actual 
classes, meaning that Cal students 
can take them for about half a unit 
and a grade. 

UCSB’s department of exercise 
and sports studies also offers similar 

programs, implementing sequen-
tial — elementary, intermediate 
and advanced — levels of instruc-
tion. Not only does the department 
present lectures along with activity 
courses, it also offers a minor in 
“exercise and sports studies with 
emphasis in athletic coaching, 
exercise and health science, fitness 
instruction or sport management.”  
And save a few, all the courses bear 
no extra cost. 

So, if other UC campuses are 
granting units for their physical 
education courses without cost, why 
doesn’t UCSD?

One reason might be that today’s 
UCSD lacks a physical education 
department. But why not reinstate 
it? 

Obviously, the distinction 
administrators failed to see in the 
1994 physical education department 
must be the reason for their hesita-
tion, but the distinction is simple: 
such a department would instruct 
and develop students’ knowledge of 
fitness and health through practical 
activity and lecture courses, while 
the recreation department would 
provide leisure opportunities to the 

people of La Jolla. The PE depart-
ment would operate within tuition 
costs without extra costs for stu-
dents, while the recreation depart-
ment could charge a fee. Finally, 
students would be held accountable 
for attendance because of the grades 
and units they receive. 

If UC Berkeley, UCSC and UCSB 
can do it, why can’t UCSD?

It is disheartening that while 
other schools encourage physi-
cal education in this way, UCSD 
requires that its students pay hefty 
prices without seeing any academic 
benefit. 

Physical activity plays an impor-
tant role for many students, but 
they are forced to relinquish it due 
to their rigorous academic sched-
ules. By awarding credits for its 
recreational courses, not only would 
UCSD reward the students who sac-
rifice their time to learn, but also 
encourage them to take up activi-
ties that would prove beneficial to 
the students’ — and ultimately the 
university’s — well-being.

UCSD Med Students Typically 
Have Less Than $100K in Debt
▶ DOCTORS, from page 1
year.

Despite the increase of tuition 
fees at UCSD’s School of Medicine, 
the average debt is less than what the 
national data suggests, according to 
Maria Savoia, the school’s vice dean 
of medical education. 

“There are national data that 
suggest that higher debt — over 
$100,000 — makes students think 
about choosing higher-paying spe-
cialties,” Savoia said. “Thankfully, 
we at UCSD aren’t at an average debt 
greater than $100,000, but this cer-
tainly is a concern for us as tuition 
and fees go higher.”

However, Assistant Director of 
UCSD Career Services Center Nicole 
O’Neil said that postgraduation debt 
is nothing new to medical students.

O’Neil said that premed stu-
dents at UCSD are advised about the 
financial burdens that they will face 
if they are serious about choosing a 
medical career, which helps to lessen 
the shock related to salary disparities 
in different fields.

“We tell all the students who 
come in here and who are interested 
in premed, ‘Be prepared to take a 
debt,’” she said. 

According to the data compiled 

by the Career Services Center, the 
number of UCSD students apply-
ing to medical school has steadily 
increased. There were 410 applicants 
in 2006, compared to 362 in 2004 
and 383 in 2005. 

O’Neil suggests that there are 
other factors that play into a stu-
dent’s specialty choice, such as life-
style and location. There are also 
personal reasons that drive students 
toward one particular medical field 
over another, she said.

Such is the case for Revelle 
College junior Elizabeth McDevitt, 
who hopes to practice pediatric 
medicine and specialize in autoim-
mune diseases because of her own 
battle with juvenile rheumatoid 
arthritis. McDevitt said the idea of 
accumulating debt was never a point 
of concern for her.

“It’s just money, and this is some-
thing I really want to do,” she said. 
“I’m sure it is something that will 
work itself out, and instead of wor-
rying about it now, I’m just focusing 
on doing the best I can to get what I 
want, and for me, that’s never been 
money.”

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK
FOCUS

J
ohn Muir College sopho-
more Tanya Menendez sat 
comfortably in a shabby 
mom-and-pop grocery store 

in southern Mexico.
Any nervousness she felt about con-

versing with the family vanished at the 
sight of the friendly storeowners. She 
was immediately welcomed into the 
shop and offered a seat at the family’s 
lunch table, where they spent the rest of 
the afternoon sharing anecdotes about 
their lives and native cultures.

This was the scene of Menendez’s 
first interview for the UCSD Mexican 
Migration Field Research and Training 
Program, which brought 34 students 
to the small village of San Miguel 
Tlacotepec to research immigration 
issues in the Mexican state of Oaxaca.

Although Menendez spent two 
weeks of her winter break in an unfa-
miliar town interviewing complete 
strangers, the locals made her feel right 
at home, she said.

“It was so amazing to go into a town 
and just walk into somebody’s house,” 
Menendez said. “I don’t know many 
storeowners in the U.S. willing to pull 
up a chair, feed me and talk to me for 
hours about their life.”

The program, partnered with UCSD’s 
Center for Comparative Immigration 
Studies and Eleanor Roosevelt College’s 
immigration studies minor, is the only 
one in the nation to train undergradu-
ates to be migration researchers, accord-
ing to political science professor and 
program co-director Wayne Cornelius.

Each year, the program sends stu-
dents to one small migrant-populated 
community in Mexico to provide an 
insider’s look on the consequences of 
international immigration as seen from 
a migrant’s perspective. Since the birth 
of the program in 2004, students have 
visited transient populations in the 
states of Jalisco, Zacatecas and Yucatan 
to generate new findings that are com-
piled into a book at the end of the 
year, used by scholars and policymakers 
interested in shaping a more humane 
immigration policy.

The study’s populations are cho-
sen for their longstanding histories of 
migration to the United States and for 
their population size of 2,500 people 
or less, making it possible to interview 
every community member age 15 to 65.

Students also witness the other 
side of the story by interviewing the 
migrants who have crossed the border 
and are now living in transplanted com-
munities in Southern California.

Cultural immersion and the 
hands-on approach to learning are 
the program’s distinguishing features, 
Menendez said.

“This progam is not about just 
memorizing facts,” she said. “It’s about 
learning and engaging in a real world 
experience. You learn in the classroom 
and actually put what you learn into use 
so you never forget it — it’s ingrained 

in you.”
Being forced to interview the towns-

people helps bridge generational and 
cultural gaps and broaden one’s perspec-
tive on the matter, Menendez said. This 
personal approach to studying migra-
tion puts a face on the issue, allowing 
one to look beyond the numbers by 
forming relationships with the natives, 
experiencing their lifestyle and becom-
ing their friends.

“I was able to connect to these people 
on a human level,” she said. “I realized 
that we all had a lot in common. Every 
one wants to make their lives better.”

Not only does interviewing give the 
issue a face, but it also sheds light on 
the emotions involved, according to 
Muir College junior Jonathan Hicken, 
who said he remembered the story of 
a man whose son was killed trying to 
cross the border.

The 65-year-old man broke down as 
he retold the incident, 10 years after it 
occurred, Hicken said.

“To shoulder the guilty conscience 
of a country in that moment was very 
powerful,” Hicken said. “It put a heart 
and tears into the issue and I know 
his story is just one of countless that 
are similar.”

For Eleanor Roosevelt College 
senior Emily Hildreth, learning about 
family separation firsthand through 
parents’ anecdotes of leaving children 
behind made her re-evaluate the effects 
of immigration. She now considers the 

costs to Mexico, rather than only assess-
ing the costs to the United States.

“There are real emotions tied to the 
whole thing,” Hildreth said. “It’s not just 
about data. It’s about real people and 
the consequences of crossing the border 
and having things that pull children 
away from their parents.”

According to Cornelius students 
form close relationships with both 
their interviewees and other program 
participants.

“It’s a very intense 24-hours-a-
day, seven-days-a-week experience,” 
Cornelius said. “[The students’] proj-
ect becomes their world and students 
make lifetime friends who are mutually 
supportive. It’s something most under-
graduates are trying to find in Greeks 
or sports but they don’t have the oppor-
tunity to be with a small group for an 
entire year.”

The binational team is composed 
of 23 undergraduates, nine graduate 
students and six Mexican graduate stu-
dents studying in Tijuana and Oaxaca. 
The program divides participants into 
eight teams, each studying a different 
subject that will later become a chapter 
of the book.

The program unites Mexican and 
American students in a common cause, 
according to Mexican graduate student 
Bribrilia Cota Cabrera, who discovered 
that many American students also come 
from immigrant families and have a 
genuine concern about the subject.

“I am happy to realize that American 
students are actually interested in this 
controversial theme,” Cabrera said in 
an e-mail in Spanish. “I think that I can 
share the knowledge that I’ve acquired 
in my day-to-day life living out the 
problems of immigration in my family, 
in my community, in my state and in 
my country.”

Hicken said he is proud to be 
involved in a program that he deems 
valuable and beneficial for the future.

“The program really gives purpose 
to your studies,” he said. “Reading 
books and taking tests is great but you 
really feel the importance of your work 
in this program.”

Cornelius mentioned the increas-
ing mobility of the world’s populations, 
where 200 million people are currently 
living outside the country they were 
born, as an important reason to study 
the topic of immigration.

“You’re likely to work with immi-
grants as coworkers, go to school with 
them,” Cornelius said. “They’re your 
neighbors, your fellow church mem-
bers and your fellow citizens, not just 
your fellow workers … [Immigration 
is] part of the fabric of life in a state 
like California and it’s important for 
people to realize what they bring — the 
benefits rather than just the costs of 
their presence.”

Looking Beyond the Normal Tourist’s Itinerary
After undergoing an hour of interrogation while fidget-ing nervously at the crossing 
to Sinai, and then being detained for 
more than two hours in the Ismailiya 
police station, we were led up three 
flights of stairs to a small office deco-
rated in papyrus and family photos. 
There, a youthful, slightly overweight 
police chief in a baby blue sweater said 
we were free to go 
— straight back to 
Cairo. “Do not go to 
Al-Arish,” he said. 
“There are 700,000 
Palestinians in 
the Sinai. You are 
American and they 
are from Hamas. It 
is too dangerous.”

Dangerous, perhaps. We predicted 
news reports from Gaza of cross-bor-
der rock hurling, as well as gunfire, 
between Palestinians and a strained 
Egyptian police force. When Eleanor 
Roosevelt College junior Kevin Staight, 
Earl Warren College senior Wesley 
Horne and I gathered in front of the 
American University in Cairo campus 
on a whim 12 hours earlier, we were 
worried the opportunity to witness 
political history in action would be lost. 
We rushed to the Metro and headed for 
Ramses Station, the main Cairo train 
depot, where we met up with John 
Muir College junior Mariela Goett.

It had been nearly a week since 
an explosion from the Palestinian side 
ofthe strip had brought down a section 
of the wall at the Rafah border cross-
ing between Gaza and Egypt, allowing 
Palestinians to flood across in search of 
much needed supplies, cigarettes and 
business opportunities. As cars drove 
across the border, Egyptian authorities 
— having earlier expressed a desire 
to approach containment passively — 
were preparing to strengthen security. 
We wanted to go before things in the 
area settled, or exploded into violence.

“When there is a big political situ-
ation in the Middle East, and it’s right 
there, you need to go,” Horne said. 
That’s the reason I came to Cairo.”

At Ramses Station we were told 
the train was booked, but managed to 
secure four third-class seats, though 

these are rarely sold to foreigners 
because of their poor riding conditions. 
We boarded the train a few minutes 
before it was scheduled to leave, tak-
ing our cramped spots next to an open 
door among several anxious Egyptian 
men. Some, opting for a more comfort-
able ride, climbed onto the baggage 
racks above the seats to lie down.

Thirty minutes later several pas-
sengers had dis-
embarked, but 
the train was still 
quietly standing in 
its loading posi-
tion at the station. 
A crowd, gathering 
outside and around 
the front of the 

train, 12 cars up, eventually drew our 
attention. Jumping out onto the aban-
doned tracks alongside us, we headed 
toward the chanting mob. 

Anxious for action in Rafah, we 
were excited and surprised to find such 
a commotion at home in Cairo. Horne 
and Staight, utilizing their burgeoning 
Arabic language skills to ask about 
the protest, were quickly surrounded 
by a crowd of 20 or more Egyptians 
eagerly venting their frustrations of 
the government’s failure to meet basic 
needs. Others were simply intrigued by 
foreigners taking interest in the dem-
onstration. 

The Egyptian Railway Authority, 
the other observers informed us, had 
raised fines. Exactly which fines were 
unclear. An interview with Railway 
Authority Supervisor Said Tahah in 
a quiet train car was equally unclear, 
despite translation. An English speaker, 
on the other end of a cell phone passed 
between Tahah and I, explained that 
fines were hiked because train conduc-
tors were arriving at destinations late 
and passengers were boarding with-
out tickets, which conductors collect 
in transit.

Fines for first-class riders had been 
tripled and third-class passengers 
would now pay a fine of 10 Egyptian 
Pounds, an increase of 20 times the 
current amount. Conductors already 
face the possibility of being attacked or 
even shot when collecting fines. The 
increase could put their lives at further 

risk. Nevertheless, the question “What 
will the Train Authority do in response 
to the protests?” garnered only a smile 
and a nod from Tahah.

Recently, the Egyptian government 
has given in to many demands of such 
economic protests, while simultane-
ously becoming increasingly harsh 
when dealing with political opposi-
tion and political rallies. Peaceful activ-
ists and politicians associated with the 
Muslim Brotherhood consistently face 
the threat of imprisonment, and many 
have been, or remain, behind bars. 
Likewise, political bloggers face jail time 
for even writing negative statements 
about President Hosni Mubarak. 

Train conductors, protesting eco-
nomic issues, were not only certain 
fines would be lowered, but, like several 
union and labor protests in the past 
few years, they would succeed without 
being detained or attacked. Less than 
three hours after the protest gathered, 
and less than an hour after I spoke 
with Said Tahah, the Railway Authority 

reversed their decision, and restored 
fines to their previous rates. We were 
not present for the announcement.

Despite our enthusiasm at being 
a part of a local political movement 
in the heart of Cairo, the four of us 
still had a determination to visit Rafah 
and witness the international situation 
unfold before us.

Mohammed, a twenty-something 
Alexandrian patiently awaiting his trip 
home, helped us find a minibus to 
Port Said before the announcement. 
We spent the next four and a half hours 
on the road. We had been told we could 
cross to Sinai in Port Said, but there we 
discovered the only bus route origi-
nated from Ismailiya. 

We were shown to a taxi that 
drove us straight back down the same 
highway to Ismailiya, where our 
minibus had stopped an hour and a 
half earlier, and arranged another bus 
to Al-Arish after allaying the driver’s 
concern that we might be Palestinian. 
With any luck, we could catch a cab 

from there to Rafah.
The traffic at the border crossing was 

halted. Trucks, cars and buses waited in 
an ever-growing queue while Egyptian 
military personnel tore through luggage 
and cargo in an attempt to sever the 
flow of supplies to Gaza. Our American 
passports, to the delight of all onboard, 
allowed us to cut to the front of the line, 
bypassing the stalled traffic — we didn’t 
fuss about special treatment.

But the mood changed quickly 
when an officer ripped Staight’s camera 
from his hand after he flashed a picture 
of confiscated cigarette cartons piled 
on the highway. Minutes later, Horne, 
Goett and I were asked to step out of 
the bus. As the photos on our cameras 
were carefully scanned, questions grew. 
“Where is this?” asked an officer in 
dark green with bloodshot eyes. “This 
is not Cairo.”

“It’s a protest at the train station,” 
I responded cautiously, knowing that

Senior Staff Writer

There is a little-known secret in 
American law enforcement: The pub-
lic is permitted to accompany offi-
cers on what’s called a ride-along, 
allowing anyone interested in law 
enforcement to experience a typical 
shift, and giving the public a look at 
where their tax dollars go. Having 
just watched “Superbad,” I was hop-
ing to have an experience similar to 
McLovin’s wild night with his new 
police-officer friends, but sadly the 
five hours I spent with police officer 
Michael Britton on his Friday night 
shift went by as many things do at 
UCSD — incredibly slowly. 
3:15 p.m.: The Waiting Room

Sergeant Gustafson comes out and 
gives me the paperwork I have to com-
plete before I can legally go on my 
ride-along. While I sign an agreement 
requiring me to listen to Britton at 
all times, I can’t help but overhear a 
student trying to press battery charges 
on a professor who pulled her shirt as 
he was kicking her out of class during 
an exam.  
 3:42 p.m.: Greetings

Britton strides in, shaking my hand 
before showing me around the depart-
ment. After we make our way out to his 
squad car, he sits me down and explains 
that in a “worst case scenario” involving 
gunfire, I am to remain low and run 
away when he draws the danger from 
me. Britton laughs at the look of terror 
on my face and assures me he does not 
expect this to happen, but wants me  
prepared nonetheless.
4:14 p.m.: The Arsenal

We drive away from the police sta-
tion onto campus loop and immediately 
I get a sense of power. Everyone around 
us is watching for our next move. We 
can stop anyone in their tracks and 
either ruin or make their day. 

As we go to many a campus cop’s 

favorite stakeout spot — the track 
parking lot at the northernmost point 
of campus — Britton goes over the 
armory that he has at his disposal: 
two rifles, a gun, a knife, pepper spray 
and an extendable baton. Despite the 
arsenal, he admits that he rarely has the 
need for any of it.

“My most important weapon is my 
brain,” Britton tells me.
4:28 p.m.: Stop Signs

The stakeout is in plain view. Britton 
does not try to hide; any alert driver 
can see us. Most do, taking unusually 
long pauses at the traffic sign, but one 
driver pulls a California roll and does 
not notice the occupied squad car until 
it’s too late. He looks over in sheer hor-
ror; however, Britton lets him go with a 
shrug, explaining he understands that 
students need to get to class on time. 

“I think, ‘Is that bad enough for 
me to stop them?’” Britton says. 
Evidently, this instance isn’t bad 
enough to ruin someone’s Friday 
afternoon with a ticket. 

Without warning, we tear off after 
a Chevy quickly halts at the three-way 
stop before taking off again. Britton 
turns his lights on and pulls the car 
over on the side of North Torrey Pines 
Road, mentioning that the tags are 
expired before he hops out and strides 
over to the car. He gives the driver, who 
claims to not have known, a fix-it ticket 
and he thanks Britton for bringing the 
violation to his attention. 

Although Britton admits that peo-
ple usually aren’t gracious when being 
pulled over, having people thank him 
is not entirely unheard of. Even so, he 
is visibly pleased to be appreciated for 
doing his job. “I don’t expect someone 
to say thanks, but it’s nice,” he says.
4:58 p.m.: Laser Time

Obeying all traffic laws, we drive 
unhurriedly over to Revelle College, 
where we pull into the loading area 
behind Plaza Cafe. Britton takes out his 
new laser gun, a more accurate gauge 

of speed than a radar gun and a tool 
he passed a test to use. With the gun 
poised and ready to go, he looks for 
speeders coming around the curve near 
the basketball courts. The speed limit 
is 25 and it only takes a few minutes to 
clock a Honda Civic going 35. Whether 
he is trying to show me how merci-
ful he is or he’s simply feeling lenient, 
Britton lets the girl go with a warning. 
However, he mentions that if the girl 
gets stopped again, his verbal warning 
is on record and will most likely influ-
ence the next officer’s decision; maybe 
he’s not letting her get away with so 
much after all.
5:15 p.m.: Hunting for Mary Jane

Since waiting for people to blow 
through stop signs can get tedious, 
Britton spends much of his time look-
ing for marijuana. At sunset, we head 
to the cliffs, which he assures me is a 
prime spot to catch stoners. Although 
he is a UCSD police officer, his jurisdic-
tion still extends a mile around campus, 
and he is legally allowed to pursue law 
breakers to anywhere in California. 
However, when we get to the cliffs, 
there are only a few visitors walking 
around and no paraphernalia in sight. 
5:49 p.m.: Still Looking

We drive to the Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography to make sure the 
doors are locked and that no one here 
is smoking marijuana, after a short 
spin around graduate student housing. 
Britton leads the way up some treacher-
ous footpaths where we stand quietly, 
listening for people who might be up to 
no good. Once again, we have no luck.

Before we can check the doors, 
Britton gets a call — a girl hurt her 
thumb while using the facilities at 
RIMAC. It’s not a car chase or a busted 
party, but it’s the highlight of the night. 
6:13 p.m.: Ouchies at RIMAC

Striding into RIMAC, we find the 
student surrounded by four employees 
who are attending to her mildly injured 
thumb. Britton goes into the gym to 

examine the machine where the acci-
dent happened and to take a picture for 
his records. Even for seemingly trivial 
events, he meticulously documents the 
incident. If Britton ever has to go to 
court, he wants to be able to remember 
the details. People stare curiously at 
Britton as he scrutinizes the bench she 

was using. They come over to see what 
all the excitement is about. Besides a 
few drops of blood on the wall, there is 
nothing to see. 

Britton’s partner shows up; now 
five people are attending to a swollen

my photos of officers at Ramses Station 
were quite illegal, and that such photos 
had been known to inspire not only 
camera smashing, but violence as well.

“These are not beautiful photos, 
these are not tourist photos,” he said 
with a condescending air and military 
authority. I did not respond.

The bus driver waited briefly 
before heading on to Al-Arish. We 
waited considerably longer — a full 
hour — whispering among ourselves 
about reacquiring our passports and 
cameras, as well as the possibility of 
resuming our journey to Gaza, before 
being shuttled back to the center of 
Ismailiya. We were shown into a quiet, 
brightly lit room with white chipped 
paint and Quranic verses hanging 
askew on the walls. We were informed 
our phones would be joining our cam-
eras in police custody. 

“Straight back to Cairo,” we mut-
tered as we collected our things from 
the reception at the police station 
before heading out into the predawn 
cold of Ismailiya. Skeptical about the 
police chief ’s assertion of danger in 
Sinai we contemplated other means of 
reaching Rafah, certain if we were to 
return to the same crossing we would 
land ourselves right back in custody. 
We never made it to Gaza.

The next morning, in a second-
class car on the train back to Cairo, 

Goett bought the morning edition of 
Al Masry Al Youm, an Egyptian daily 
paper. On the front page was a picture 
of the Ramses Station protest — a 
reminder of our previous day’s adven-
ture and our subsequent run-in with 
the Egyptian military.

Back at Ramses Station, heightened 
security meant to keep ticketless pas-
sengers, those who would have faced 
the consequences of new fines, off 
the platform, was another footnote to 
the demonstration and a reminder of 
Cairo’s struggle with issues of class.

Stepping out into the sun and 
toward the Ramses Station Metro stop, 
we were greeted by the unavoidable 
shouts of taxi drivers. 

“Welcome to Cairo.”
“You want to see the pyramids?”
These shouts, meant for tourists 

who would normally never experience 
the frustrating policies and politics of 
Egypt firsthand, were a vivid reminder 
of defeat. They were meant for those 
more interested in a photo of a pyramid 
than in the political failure at the bor-
der and the station. They ignored the 
Egypt struggling with control, author-
ity and transparency — an Egypt tour-
ists rarely get the chance, or even want, 
to experience.

thumb. Having nothing else to do, we 
walk to the squad car conveniently 
parked in front of the gym — a major 
perk of the job.
6:59 p.m.: A Final Attempt

By the time we approach Mandeville, 
Britton is still persistently tracking drug 
users. I make a note to tell everyone I 
now know that smoking on campus is 
a terrible idea. Although we also look 
for people tagging the newly painted 
stairways, Britton seems set on finding 
some pot smokers.

As we walk down the stairwell, he 
points to graffiti referencing “Star Wars” 
and bursts into laughter. Suddenly it 
occurs to me that deep down inside, 
this police officer is a real person. In 
fact, Britton enjoys typical interests and 
pastimes like playing video games and 
basketball. By the time he points out 
the “Star Trek” tag and laughs, I know I 
have a bit of a geek on my hands.
7:02 p.m.: Door Checking

Door checking is probably the most 
tedious, and least glamorous, part of 
being an officer on campus. Since many 
on-campus crimes involve theft, deter-
ring property loss is a main pursuit. We 
walk into the Natural Science Building 
and although it is a Friday night, we 
find many labs occupied. Britton is 
exasperated to find many doors wide 

open, mentioning that thefts occur 
because people would rather prop open 
the doors than carry their keys. 
7:57 p.m.: Panda Express

After Britton calls dispatch to alert 
them he is on foot patrol, we head to 
Price Center for a quick bite. Over his 
dinner of chicken and rice, Britton phi-
losophizes about what his career means 
to him. Although he has spent his time 
on the job in relatively safe areas, he 
still finds his work satisfying. Going 
into the county to help during the fires, 
he says, was one of the most rewarding 
things he has done. He also mentions 
that, although he has seen people at 
their worst, he has not lost faith in 
humanity. However, he has been let 
down occasionally. “I have been disap-
pointed … like, ‘Did you guys really get 
in a fight over this?’” he says. 

Heading back to the police station to 
fill out reports, which Britton bemoans 
as being incredibly time consuming, 
I ask if we have just experienced what 
he would consider a typical shift. He 
thinks for a moment, trying to com-
pare the last five hours to his past year 
at UCSD.

“It varies day to day … there is no 
rhyme or reason to it,” he tells me.

six Triton batters throughout the 
game, but was always able to escape 
unscathed. UCSD left nine runners 
on base, a staggering total for a team 
that prides itself on its offensive 
prowess.

The unfortunate pitching punching 
bag was UCSD’s senior starter Melissa 
Ward, who pitched seven gutsy innings 
and allowed only a fourth-inning run 
on a two-out double to center. Even 
Ward’s complete-game, one-run, 
seven-strike-out performance couldn’t 
overcome her team’s anemic offense 
and she was dealt her first loss of the 
young season. 

In Friday’s nightcap, the first five 
innings mirrored the pitcher’s duel 
of the previous game, with neither 
team scoring any runs. In the bot-
tom of the fifth, junior first-base-
man Jenni Habib and senior third-
baseman Jenny Maze finally came 
through with the clutch hits that 
eluded the Tritons, notching a pair 
of RBIs for a score of 2-0. The two-
run cushion was more than enough 
for junior pitcher Lauren Chastain, 
who tossed a three-hit shutout while 
striking out five.

San Diego’s offensive struggles 
went from a problem to a pandemic 
in the third game of the series, when 
the team was shut out again 4-0 in 
an extra-innings heartbreaker on 
Feb. 9. Again, Ward was the unde-
serving losing pitcher, but this time 
around, there was almost nothing 
that she could have done better. The 
southpaw threw a no-hitter through 
seven innings of regulation play, but 
was forced to take her no-no bid 
into extras.

After another perfect eighth 
inning, Chico State finally broke 
through in the ninth. A one-out 
error by leftfielder Randelle Bundy 
put the go-ahead run on base before 
the visiting Wildcats put together 
two doubles and an infield single

blocks by the 49ers tied the game, 23-
23, but the Tritons pulled ahead with 
a little run, capped by an ace to bring 
the score to 26-24. Long Beach State 
closed out the game with a kill.

The Tritons exploited poor 49er 
hitting, taking an early advantage and 
clinging to it late into the game, but 
Long Beach State overcame its numer-
ous errors, coming back from a grow-
ing deficit to take the lead, 28-29. 
After five game points between the two 
teams, the Tritons prevailed 35-33. 

UCSD finally broke the recurring 
theme that has plagued it all season: 
having a late lead and seeing it disap-
pear. While game three was no dif-
ferent in terms of losing its lead, Ring 
pointed to the team’s experience in 
the pressure situation as the key to 
the win.

“We’ve been in that late-game 
position before and the more times 
we’re there, the better we’ll get at it,” he 
said. “Sometimes we come out on the 
winning side and others we don’t. Any 
little mistake can cost you but our 
composure was good and I thought 
[freshman setter] Phil [Bannan] really 
managed the offense well.” 

The energy was short lived as the 
49ers rolled in game four, winning 
30-18. Ring said one of the team’s all-
American players took over, sending 
over a unique serve that the Tritons 
rarely see and were having difficulty 
passing.

UCSD had high expectations 
against the 49ers after their 30-19, 
30-15, 30-27 victory over HIU. The 
Royals had difficulty defending the 
UCSD offense as the Tritons had 
a field day out-hitting HIU, 46-27. 
Senior outside hitter Russ Hardy led 
the way for the Tritons with 13 kills. 
UCSD used a 20-9 run to close out 
game one after seven ties and two 

lead changes. 
Little changed in game two as the 

Tritons continued to roll, firing out to 
a 22-9 lead. This lead would stick as 
they cruised to take two games to no 
advantage. The Royals fought from 
behind all of game three but were 
unable to match up to a faster UCSD 
team. Ring said the Royals were play-
ing with a bare-boned roster due to 
injury and expects a much different 
match next time around.

“[HIU] was a little depleted but 
we didn’t let that mentally affect us,” 
he said. “We served really well, our 
passing was strong and our middles 
effective. We handled the match from 
start to finish. This is definitely a 
team that will be better when they 
are healthy.”

The Tritons now hold a 4-8 over-
all record but are still looking for 
their second conference win. To get 
that win in arguably the toughest 
conference in the nation, Ring said 
the team needs three or four guys to 
put together solid stretches during 
a match.

“One or two guys having a good 
statistical game just aren’t enough,” 
he said. “We can win games but we 
need to get those stretches together 
with three or four guys. When that 
happens, we’re a good team.” 

The Tritons are back in action 
Feb. 13 and Feb. 16 with a pair of con-
ference matches at No. 11 University 
of California and No. 5 Pepperdine, 
who both knocked off UCSD a little 
over a week ago. The familiarity will 
play the lead role as the Tritons look 
to topple the Trojans and the Waves, 
respectively, and there will be little 
room for error as UCSD tries to stay 
afloat in the MPSF.

that scratched across four runs to 
seal the win.

Head coach Patti Gerckens was 
straightforward with her assessment 
of why her team dropped two of its 
last three games.

 “Our offense is nonexistent and 
our pitchers are getting no support 
whatsoever,” Gerckens said. “We’re 
not making adjustments at the plate. 
[Chico’s pitcher, Kyrstle Shaw] is 
no better; in fact, I think we faced 
better pitching last week. We’re just 
refusing to make adjustments.”

Sophomore catcher Nicole Saari 
echoed her coach’s observations, 
saying that to regain its winning 

ways the team only has to get back 
to playing its offensive style of soft-
ball.

“We need to go out there with 
confidence and just know that we 
can get back to hitting the ball like 
we know how,” Saari said. “We need 
to start making adjustments between 
every at-bat and showing good dis-
cipline at the plate. Our pitchers are 
doing an amazing job, and it’s up to 
us to give them all of the support 
that they deserve.”

Between games, Gerckens lividly 
scolded her team for chasing bad 
pitches and the players’ inability to 
get the clutch hit. The Tritons used 
their coach’s impassioned speech to 
kick-start their offense and were 
able to triple their run production 

from the previous three games, pull-
ing out a 6-5 win to salvage the 
series split. 

Freshman shortstop Sarah 
Woofter’s first collegiate homerun 
helped pace the Tritons to a 5-3 
lead, but in the top of the seventh 
UCSD was unable to shut the door 
and allowed two runs, sending the 
game once again into extra innings. 
In the bottom of the eighth, the 
Tritons were able to find a much 
needed clutch hit, and won the game 
on Chastain’s walk-off single up the 
middle, scoring Woofter and hope-
fully giving the team the confidence 
it needs to put its recent offensive 
struggles behind it.

The Tritons will travel to Phoenix 
to participate in the Schutt Sports 
Leadoff Classic from Feb. 14 to Feb. 
16, when they are slated to play 
Grand Canyon University, Missouri 
Western State and New Mexico 
Highlands University.

game to seal the 72-59 win over Sonoma State.
Three Tritons scored in the double digits, 

with Mezzetta and Osier leading the way with 17 
points and Gaskin adding 15 points. Osier helped 
the Tritons out-rebound the Seawolves by pulling 
down 15 boards.

“We responded to the loss [against Humboldt 
State] just like I hoped we would,” head coach 
Charity Elliott said. “We were extremely focused 
and we played 40 minutes of intense basketball.”

UCSD’s win came after a disappointing night 
against Humboldt State in which the Tritons gave 
up a 10-point halftime lead to lose the contest in 
the second half. 

The Tritons played a solid first half, taking 
their first lead of the game on Noonan’s three-
pointer with 11:39 left in the first half to make 
the score 16-14. After the Lumberjacks answered 
back with a three-pointer of their own, Osier 
made a layup and sophomore guard Laura Moore 
scored another three-pointer for the Tritons to 
start a UCSD run. The Tritons ended the half 
strongly, with key scores from Noud and senior 
center Diahnn Futalan to give the Tritons a 34-24 
lead at halftime.

The second half proved to be a tough one for 
the Tritons as the Lumberjacks began chipping 
away at UCSD’s lead right away. With the Tritons 
struggling, Humboldt State finally tied the game 
at 45 with 10:58 left. UCSD’s defense was unable 
to come up with any stops to answer back to the 
Lumberjacks, and offensively, the Tritons had 
trouble getting their shots down.

With 1:31 left in the game, Humboldt State 
opened up an 11-point lead, eventually handing 
the Tritons the loss. The Lumberjacks used a bal-
anced attack — all of their starters finished the 
game in double digits — to outscore the Tritons, 
52-31, in the second half. 

“The things we were doing in the game weren’t 
really working and we didn’t change anything,” 
Mezzetta said. 

Elliott cited the Tritons’ defensive struggles 
as the main reason for UCSD’s meltdown in the 
second half. 

“Our intensity on defense was much less than 
it needed to be,” she said. “We played 30 minutes 
instead of 40 minutes.”

The Tritons will play their last regular season 
games at home on Feb. 15 against Cal State Los 
Angeles and Feb. 16 against Cal State Dominguez 
Hills. The team will celebrate Senior Night in 
the game against Cal State Dominguez Hills, as 
UCSD’s eight seniors play the last home game of 
their careers. 

“It’s really important that we maintain focus 
especially on Senior Night,” Elliott said. 

The Tritons will face two teams that they 
beat earlier in the season and they will need to 
repeat those results if they want to earn a high 
seed in the CCAA tournament from March 4 
through March 8. Both games will be played 
at RIMAC Arena at 5:30 p.m. with a senior 
ceremony before the contest against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills.

games over the Seawolves and swept the season 
series with the former CCAA champion. 

“I remember my first two years here; we had 
a tough time with Sonoma State,” junior forward 
Shane Poppen said. “We’d have close games, but 
we couldn’t finish. To beat them both times this 
year, that feels really good.”

Four Tritons scored in double digits, led by 
a career-high 17 points from junior guard Alan 
Husted, who connected on 5-of-6 three-point-
ers and also grabbed three rebounds in only 17 
minutes off the bench. 

Husted, who also grabbed three boards and 
added one steal and one assist, said he has been 
getting good looks at the basket.

“Luckily I got some open shots against the 
zone,” Husted said. “I feel like I’ve been shooting 
the ball well. Kelvin and Clint penetrating and 
getting me open shots, and if I’m that open I feel 
confident shooting the ball.”

Fellow reserve junior guard Andrew Hatch 
added 12 points on a perfect 4-for-4 field-goal 
shooting night, while Patterson and Lawley 
scored 15 and 14 points, respectively. Patterson 
put together a double-double, adding 10 
rebounds, while Kim was just shy with nine 
points and a game-high 10 assists.

In a battle of the CCAA’s second-place teams, 
UCSD struggled early on from the floor against 
Humboldt State, scoring only four points in the 
first 9:29 of the game. The Tritons’ swarming 
defense kept them close, with Humboldt State 
coming to just eight points in that same stretch. 
The Lumberjacks seemed poised to pull away, 
however, with three three-pointers in just over 
two minutes and a 21-11 advantage with 7:04 
to play in the half. Kim and senior guard Clint 
Allard drove to the basket for layups on con-
secutive possessions as the Tritons cut into the 
Humboldt State advantage. Getting as close as 
two points following an Husted three-pointer, 
the Tritons would go into the breakdown four 
after Husted found Poppen for a layup with six 
seconds on the clock.

According to Lawley, the Tritons did not 
treat Humboldt State lightly, having surren-
dered a 45-39 halftime lead and eventually los-
ing to the Lumberjacks in January. 

“We came in knowing that Humboldt was a 
great team,” Lawley said. “They beat us at their 
place, so [there was] definitely some vengeance 
there.”

UCSD wasted little time in the second half, 
tying the score within three-and-a-half min-
utes following intermission. The Tritons played 
patiently and in control, adeptly handling the 
Lumberjacks’ full-court pressure and using it 
to find open looks on the offensive end. After 
Poppen put back a missed three-pointer by 
Allard, an Allard steal and assist led to a three-
pointer from junior forward Darryl Lawlor that 
gave UCSD its first lead of the game, 41-40, 
with 13:17 to play. UCSD would not trail for the 
remainder of the game, despite leading by no 
more than six points over the next 10 minutes. 
Humboldt State was unable to mount a come-
back, going 1-of-7 from long distance over the 
final 2:22, as the Tritons converted 12-of-16 
from the line to seal the victory.

The Tritons converted exactly half of their 
field-goal attempts, though only 4-of-17 from 
behind the arc. However, UCSD held a 35-28 
rebounding advantage and went 30-for-37 from 
the charity stripe, compared to Humboldt State’s  
17-for-25. UCSD received a balanced scoring 
attack, with five Tritons in double digits. Kim 
led the way with 14 points, followed by Lawlor 
with 13, Allard with 11 and Lawley and Poppen 
with 10 each. Poppen also grabbed a game-high 
10 rebounds and had two steals in 20 minutes of 
work off the bench.

“Now we’re in the thick of things in the 
CCAA, so everything is a big game from here 
on out if we want to be playing meaningful 
games in March,” Husted said. “We’ve just got 
to take it one game at a time and hopefully, one 
victory at a time.”

UCSD concludes its regular season home 
schedule next weekend, hosting Cal State Los 
Angeles on Feb. 15 and Cal State Dominguez 
Hills on Feb. 16. Both games are slated for 
7:30 p.m. tip-offs, with Saturday night’s game 
preceded by a brief pregame Senior Night cer-
emony.

The senior center dropped 15 points 
and seven rebounds in 23 minutes in 

the Tritons’ 72-59 blowout win against 
Sonoma State on Feb. 9.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — The sea-
son-long trend of UCSD splitting its 
weekend home 
games kept the 
Tritons in a 
third-place tie 
in California 
C o l l e g i a t e 
Athletics Association standings.

UCSD saw a 10-point lead evapo-
rate in its game against Humboldt State 
University on Feb. 8, which ended in a 
76-65 loss. But the Tritons answered 
back in their game against Sonoma 
State University the next night, vying 
with the Seawolves over third place in 
the conference. The Tritons won the 
contest by a score of 72-59. 

In the Tritons’ game against 
Sonoma State, the two teams played a 
very tight first half with the Seawolves 
holding on to the lead in the early 
going. Both teams found success early 
from beyond the arc, with senior guard 
Alexis Mezzetta hitting three three-
pointers and Sonoma State converting 
on four three-pointers in the first six 
minutes of the contest. 

The Seawolves held the lead until 
the Tritons tied the game at 20 with 
sophomore forward Erin Noonan’s 
jumper with eight minutes to go in the 
half. The Tritons then took the lead 
on another jumper from Noonan, and 
the teams went back and forth for the 
rest of the half. After junior forward 
Michelle Osier missed two free throws 
at the end of the half, the Tritons 
entered halftime trailing the Seawolves 

by a score of 28-27. 
Sonoma State started the second-

half scoring with another three-point 
basket to give the Seawolves a 31-27 
lead. The two teams continued to bat-
tle each other, with neither able to gain 
any separation from the other. 

With the score 53-49 in favor of 
the Tritons, an Osier layup started a 

UCSD run to give the Tritons control 
of the game. Scores from senior cen-
ter Alexis Gaskin and senior forward 
Meaghan Noud helped the Tritons take 
a 60-53 lead with three minutes left in 
regulation. The Tritons made their free 
throws in the last few minutes of the

Tritons Roll to Fifth-Straight Win

By Joe Tevelowitz
Senior Staff Writer

MEN’S BASKETBALL — With two 
double-digit victories over the week-
end, the Tritons extended a five-
game winning streak that puts them 
just one game behind the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association lead 
heading into the final stretch of the 
regular season. 

The Tritons rebounded from an 
early 10-point deficit on Feb. 8 to 
defeat Humboldt State University 84-
72. The following night, UCSD never 
trailed and notched a decisive 82-61 
win against Sonoma State University. 
With the victories, UCSD improves to 
14-6 overall and 10-4 in the CCAA.

With the game against the Sonoma 
Seawolves broadcast on CSTV as part 
of the NCAA Division II National 
Broadband Broadcast schedule, the 
Tritons took the opportunity to prove 
themselves in front of a national audi-
ence. While UCSD was able to take 
an early lead, a nearly four-minute 
scoring drought that began with just 
over 10 minutes to play in the first 
half allowed Sonoma State to tie the 
game at 18. 

Head coach Chris Carlson’s 
squad responded, scoring 19 points 
in the final six-and-a-half minutes 
and outscoring the Seawolves 13-6 
in the final four minutes of the half. 
Shooting over 60 percent from the 

field and connecting on 6-of-8 from 
long distance, the Tritons led by as 
much as 11 and held a 37-28 advan-
tage at the break.

 “They kind of played harder than 
us in the first half,” junior center A.J. 
Maulhardt said. “Coach talked to us 
at halftime and told us ‘no one plays 
harder in our house,’ so we came out 
in the second 
half, knocked 
down some 
shots and 
D’ed up.”

Due to a 
technical foul against Sonoma State 
coach Pat Fuscaldo that came at the 
end of the first half, UCSD opened 
the second with sophomore guard 
Kelvin Kim hitting one-of-two free 
throws to extend to a 10-point lead. 
The Seawolves climbed no closer 
than eight points the rest of the way 
as sophomore guard Jordan Lawley 
connected on two early second-half 
threes and UCSD found its first 20-
point lead with 15:33 left in the game. 
Despite increased pressure from 
Sonoma State, the Tritons executed on 
both ends, turning the ball over only 
10 times in the game and converting 
31 of their 49 field goal attempts in 
the game on 22 assists. UCSD would 
hit 6-of-8 from three-point range, 
and junior forward Henry Patterson 
punctuated the victory with a thun-
derous dunk at 4:07 left in the game. 
The 21-point final margin serving as 
the Tritons’ biggest win of the year.

SOFTBALL — After a season-open-
ing series in which the Tritons 
scored 32 runs on their way to a 
4-0 record in the Mizuno Best of the 
West tournament, UCSD was only 
able to scratch up six runs over four 
games this weekend against Chico 
State. Although, for the most part, 
their offense went into hiding this 
weekend, the Tritons were still able 
to split the series 2-2, leaving with 
an overall record of 6-2.

In the series’ first game, UCSD 
didn’t lose for lack of opportunities, 
and in the end was unable to come 
through with a clutch hit, getting 
shutout of 1-0. The leadoff man 
reached base and moved over to

9 game, but both times the runner 
was left stranded. The Chico pitch-

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — After an 
easy win over Hope International 
University on Feb. 6, UCSD only 
managed to win one game against 
No. 3 Long Beach State on Feb. 8. The 
crushing loss to the 49ers was just the 
beginning of another gauntlet against 
top squads that the Tritons must run. 
While the HIU Royals posed no com-
petition for the Tritons on Feb. 6, the 
49ers were another monster altogeth-
er. Head coach Kevin Ring expected 
a tough game, but nearly every Triton 

match against teams in the nationally 
recognized Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation will prove tough.

 “We knew it was going to be a 
challenge against Long Beach State,” 
Ring said. “They’re undefeated and 
one of the best teams out there. I was 
really impressed with how hard we 
fought.”

UCSD had a chance against the 
49ers but was unable to capitalize in 
the early stages of the game. The two 
teams’ offenses were evenly matched, 
but the 49ers used their height 
advantage at the net to out block the 
Tritons. Long Beach State cruised in 
game one winning 30-22. The teams 
were close early, but the 49ers used a 
late service run to open up breathing 
room and close out the game. UCSD 
steadied out in game two keeping it 
close and holding a lead, 21-19. Two

after another split against 
foes, again failing to win
