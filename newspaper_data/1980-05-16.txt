Regents: 
Ugliness 
Stops Here 
BY J. BERESFORD-HOWE 

New. F.ditnr 
LOS ANGELES - Ever 

wonder why architecture at the 
ut' campuses is so boring and 
dull? 
. SQme of the UC Regents do. 

and ' their curiosity yesterday 
almost killed a $2.5 milhon 
Irvine library building at the 
first day of a two-day meeting 
in Los Angeles. 

After a 10-minute slide 
show on the "modular 
spine" medical library, which 
calls for a block surrounded by 
circular constructed auxiliary 
rooms, Regent William 
French Smith looked up, a 
~ttle binded by a flickering 
overhead light, and said, "just 
because there's a lot of 
uglint!ss doesn't mean we have 
to add to it. I really don't like 
this." 

"I would like to second 
that," Regent Yori Wadda 
added. "We let a lot of ugly 
buildings be built in this 
system, particularly at the Sari 
Diego campus." 

UC Irvin e Chancellor 
Daniel Aldrich admitted to the 
Board that his first reaction to 
the proj ct was that it looked 
like "a factory. " 

But, he added, " I stopped 
looking at it as a library and 
started thinking of it as a multi-
purpose center. On e I got 
past that, it was atisfaclory." 

UC President David Saxon 
quickly moved approval of the 
complex, but lost a voice vote. 
A roll call vote, including all 
members of the Regents' 
Buildings and Grounds 
Committee, stiffened their 
spines and reversed the 
decision. 

"You've been listening to 
our objections to the center, :' a 
disgruntled Smith said, "but I 
don't think you've been 
looking." 

The first day of the meeting 
was otherwise uneventful. 

The Regents Finance 
Committee approved a $2.50 
increase in the UCSD Student 
Center fee. 

About 20 students from the 
Alliance for Peace continued

Reg Fee Approves 
La\V Student Plan 
For UCSD Advice 
Cites 75% Savings Over Present 
System, Claims Quality Adequa e 

BY PETER MORTENSEN ' . 
The Registration Fee committee vo~ed 10·1-1 in open 

session yesterday to endorse a subcommittee proposal 
which calls for the elimination of professional legal services 
and the substituteion of an attorney-supervised legal dinic 
internship. 

The proposal was approved only five days after the 
committee first considered UCSD's $65,000 per year legal 
services program, despite protests from Legal Services 
staff that lhere had not been enough time to assess the 
impact of any program changes. 

It is now up to Vice ChanceUor of Student Affairs 
Richard Armitage to decide whether or not to implement 
restructure or reject the Reg Fee committee'~ 
recommendation. 

According to Liz Riley, Reg Fee committee chairperson, 
Armitage had indicated he would go along with the 
proposal if it received the group's "strong endorsement." 
Riley believes the vote is "strong enough" for Armitage 
adding that there was no concerted effort on the part of any 
committee member to defeat the measure. 

The proposal is one of many "dyad" (two-person 
committee) reports now being considered for the 
committee's 1980-8 1 budget, expected to total $5 million. 

Night and morning low clouds hould continue through the week-
end but afternoons will be sunnier and war~er. Highs in the upp r 
60's. Breaker 3 ·5 feet at eleven second interval'l. 

The Reg Fee plan entails the hiring of five University of 
San Diego law school 'ltudents and a qualified 
lawyer/supervisor for three thre ·hour blocks per week 
with a capabi lity of handling 45 stud nt during that 
we kly schedule. 

McElroy's Anti-9 Letter May 
Have Been Legal But Intproper 

BY REBECCA LOWEN 
Staff Writer 

Was Chancellor William McElroy's letter to 
campus staff describing the evils of Proposition 9 
legal and proper? . 

Whether or not it was legal for McElroy to use 
UCSD Foundation money to send the letter 
"depends on the character of the funds and the 
conditions governing their use. It would also 
have to be determined if the letter was in the 
realm of a political statement or was done with 
the intent of educating the community about 
Proposition 9 ," Nick Aguilar, lawyer for UCSD's 
LeHal Services, told the Daily Guardian. 

'Even if the use of the money may have been 
within university regulations; it can still be asked 
whether the use of funds was proper," Aguilar 
added. 

It is difficult to know what kind of restrictions 
governed 't~ use of the $2,000 in Foundation 
money. No one in either the Chancellor's office or 
at the Foundation knows or will explain exactly 

where the money went. 
The Foundation's bOokkeeper says that she 

wrote a check to the Regents and designated the 
money for the Chancellor's Discretionary Fund. 

But McElroy and Bob Oakes , UCSD's 
Budget Manager, say that the $2 ,000 would not 
have gone into this fund, which they refer to as an 
"opportunity fund." 

. The opportunity fund contains about 
$200,000 and must be sued, at the Chancellor's 
discretion. for the university or for educational or 
administrative purposes, according to McElroy. 

"Money from the Foundation would never go 
into the opportunity fund," said Oakes. "If 
occasionally McElroy gets a grant, the money is 
assi~ned to a special account. It doesn't come 
through the budget." 

This account is like a "checking account," and 
it is "literally unrestricted," explained Oakes.

Ril y estimated th cost of 
the program at between 
$12,000 and $15;000 per 
year to students over the 
current service. 

" Ideally w want a blue· 
ribbon legal service here, and 
every legal problem that 
comes up will be taken care of. 
Unfortunately , the charge of 
the Reg Fee committee is not 
to do that," she said. "We 
have to take the entire Reg Fee 
and look at what type of 
services that want money to 
serve students and prioritize 
them . . . and, according to 
student surveys, legal services 
falls about in the middle." 

Although Riley acknow· 
ledges that the internship 
program is not the "best" legal 
service available, she feels it is 
quite adequate for the needs of 
UCSD students and also frees 
desperately needed funds and 
office space for services of 
"higher priority." 

Student Records Bill Passes ComDlittee 
BY CAROLYN FRIDAY constituents are students and I want to see 

that they get treated like everybody else." 
Under debate still, it would be up to the 

university to pay that student's court costs 
and attorney fees . 

A major concern of Nick 
Aguilar, present head of 
UCSD Legal Services, i . ~at 
the USB legal clinic would not 
be providing the quality and 
quantity his office now offers. 

In particular, he noted that a 
legal "diversion network," set 
up in cooperation with the 
vice-chancellor of student 
affairs office, would not 
effectively keep students out of 
the ourt system as it was 
intended to do. 

Sacramento Correaondent 
A long and tough negotiating process 

culminated Wednesday in the passage of 
Berkeley Assembly member Tom Bates' 
Student Records Bill by th~ Assembly 
Education Committee, 8·3. 

The bill will give students the same 
rights enjoyed by all other citizens of 
California by making it possible for them 
to sue the state's public universities and 
colleges for any abuses of stud nt's 
record. 

"Everybody else in our so iety has the 
right to go to court when they hav 
exhausted the admini trative remedi ," 
Bates said. "Tw nty-fiv p r nt of my 

UC Student Lobby Co-director Amiel 
Jaramillo told the committee during the 
first hearing last week, "Realistically, 
students don't have access to the court if 
their rights are violated. They do not have 
the money to put up funds to pay the 
attorney. This bill would allow an attorney ' 
to take the c~se on c.onsignment." 

If UC does not maintain accurate 
records, violat th confid ntiality of a 
tudent's records or refuses to provide 

access to his records, the student may 
seek an injun tion after first exhausting 
the int rnal administrativ proce s 
laborated by a h ampus. 

If, however, a student eeks damages 
from the university as well, then the 
student must also exhaust the grievance 
procedure set out in the Family Education 
Rights and Privacy Act. 

This would involve filing a complaint 
with the Health, Education and Welfare 
Departrn nt in Washington which should 
take not more than ix months, according 
to Jaramillo. 

It would be up to the stud nt to provide 
evid nc that the univer ity a ted

Chomsky Details 
Rule Of' Terror . 
By· US Clients 

BY BUD RUSSELL 
Noam Chomsky is the type of person the main'stream 

media ignores while he lives and lauds as a great example of 
what American political pluralism can produce once he's 
safely dead. Fortunately, Chomsky still lives, and his latest 
critique of American foreign policy, co·authored by Edward 
S. Herman, is now available. The Political Economy of 
Human Rights; Volume One, The Washington Connection 
and Third World Fascism is a disturbing book - so 
disturbing that an earlier version lay in the warehouses of 
Warner Communications for several years after corporate ..... 
heads, aghast at it's 'a1legations, declined to release it. 

Berkeley's Garbage Inspires 
Visions of Recycled Society 

On the faculty at Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
since the early 50s , Chomsky is perhaps the country' 
foremost linguist. He further distinguished himself during the 
60s with a steady flow of cogently argued essays critical of 
American policy, in Indochina (collected in American Power 
and the New Mandarins and For Reasons of State ). 

In this book Chomsky and Herman - a professor of 
Finance at University of Pennsylvania - have assembled a 
vast array of data and testimony supporting their thesis that in 
the past 25 years "the balance of terror" in the world "appears 
to have shifted to the West and its clients, with the United 
States setting the pace as sponsor and supplier." The authors 
detail massive torture carried out by US "client" regimes. 
primarily in Latin America, citing evidence that the American 
government has trained the torturers and supplied the 
equipment, even going so far as to smuggle it in diplomatic 
pouches. Our leaders follow such policies, the authors assert, 
in order to provide a specific fOI"TT1 of stability and a "favorable 
investment climate" for multinational financial interests.

In 1982 or 1983, the city 
hopes to start burning all of its

work in conjunction with a 
massive recycling program to 
be set up by the local Ecology 
Center. If this plan works, the 
recycling will provide revenue 
and jobs. while the steam will 
be piped to nearby industries. 

But that's in the future. In

done a surprisingly enlighten.

Bob Beally started a 
recycled building materials 
operation called Flight 

S~lvage a few years ago. 
"People's ideas of solid waste 
disposal are like stuffing things 
into a closet," says Beatty, 
"You can't get away with that 
forever - sooner or later the 
closet's going to overflow." 

O'Loughiin and Beatty had 
the recycling credentials, but 
they lacked the credibility, 
capital and heavy equipment 
experience which the city 
expected. So they teamed up 
with some friends who owned 
a local paving and grading

You may be getting the ideaj Chomsky and Herman think 
our government's human rights policy is more than a bit 
hypocritical. The mainstream media also comes in for 
criticism. The authors contend that these worthies cope with 
contradictions in the government's foreign policy in a variety 
of ways, ranging from rationalization to manipulation and 
omission. Support of brutal dictators is said to represent a step 
toward democracy. an unfortunate but necessary bulwark 
against communism. The admittedly abominable 
Cambodian genocide receives media saturation, while the 
equally loathsome barbarity of our allies in Indonesia who 
have "very possibly killed as many people (in practically 
unknown East Timor) as did the Khmer Rouge," is virtually 
ignored, 

. employs some 60 to 70 peOple 
on various engineering and 
demoJition jobs. 

Combining. the ecologists' 
enthusiasm with the 
contra·ctors' practical 
experience, the new 
partnership won the city 

./ contract. and began to tum 
vision. into practice. 

The upshot of our government's policies , say the authors, is 
that much of the world has become a powder keg ready to 
explode on u. - witness Iran. While Jimmy Carter heaped 
praise on the shah, citing the "respect, admiration and love 
the Iranians felt for their leader, Amnesty International was 
saying that "no country in the world (had) a worse record in 
human rights" than Iran under his rule. Our policy rebounds 
on us at home aI well. We have created a Valt arms industry 
- not to mention torture industry - to supply our "clients." 
We have powerful ves~ed interests intent on maintaining the 
status quo. In effect, we become like th~ tyrants we create and

Letters to the Editor 

Start Learning Names Now 
Editor: 

This is an open leiter to all students at UCSD. 
It concerns the new movement sweeping across 
this ·campus. You ask "Just what i. this new 
movement?" Well this new movement is the 
SLNN which is the Start Learning Names Now 
campaign. In an attempt to bring harmony and 
happiness to the entire student body at UCSD 
the SLNN has embarked upon this very 
idealistic and optimistic endeavor. The 
movement consists basically on the premise 
that every person on campus should learn every 
other person's first name! This means that 
before a student is to graduate s/he must learn 
the entire student body's first names. The 
movement spreads through the following 
process: When you approach an individual that 
you do not know you must extend your-hand , in 
a friendly manner. and tell this fellow student 
your first name and in turn request their first 
name. After exhanging names and smiles you 
then conclude by explaining what the SLNN is 
and request of this human being, that you have 
just encountered, to also spread the SLNN to 
any stranger s/he comes across. However if a 
student should, which is absolutely unheard of, 
refuse to give their proper narne that person 
shall forever be referred to a. a "REGGGGY." 

This is a student cause and will only succeed 
if we aI students want it to. So stop being 
iohif-itf><l And start rf'Achin!( ('lIt. It is time we all 

g,;>t to know each 'ot!:ter and started being 
friends!! So spread the SLNN and tell your 
friends about it. 

Finally, there will 'be many activities being 
undertaken over the next three weeks to 
stimulate interest in this vital cause. Some of 
tllese activities will include SLNN members 
passing out name tags and raffle tickets.. We 
would also please request that everyone wear 
their name tag until everyone learns everyone's 
names . If you don't receive an official tag you 
can be creative and make a hand made one. 
The raffle tickets will be free to everyone who 
wears a tag. The raffle will be held June 6 . At 
that time three copies of the Beatles' Rarities 
album will be given away . They have been 
graciously donated by KSDT and ASsorted 
Vinyl. We hope the Beatles' song "You know 
my name," on the above mentioned album, will 
be an inspiration for everybody to get involved. 

If you have any questions about why this 
craziness is very important and beneficial or 
you just want to get involved in SLNN please 
contact Mitch, Matt , or Jeremy at 452·4452. 
Thank you!

The coalition, also known 

as the "No on 9" coalition, is 
registered with the state as a 
political organization and, 
according to its · San Diego 
director, is "definitely 
political." 

AgiJar emphasized that "it's 
a situation where IIOmething 
may be legal, but it may not be 
proper." And, according to 
Aguilar, "It's up to the 
Chancellor to decide _if it's 
proper or improper." 

"The next recourse is the 
courts," said Aguilar. .

Redlands Rules Finals, 
But 4 Tritons Named 
All·District-a Record 

BY BARBARA HAAS 
Senior SlAff Wriler 

What was supposed to be the men's 
tennis NAIA District III Regional 
Championships last weekend became 
instead a duel match between UCSD 
and the University of Redlands. 

.. Unfortunately, Redlands outplayed the 
Tritons in the final rounds , taking first 
place with 36 points over UCSO's 20. 
. : Four UCSD players were seeded in 
the top eight positions in the six·team 
tournament. Paul Metsch had the 
second spot , with John Rosenberg, 
Everett Gee and Billy Hein scheduled 
in . the fourth, seventh and eighth 
places. All these rankings came below 
corresponding players from Redlands . 
Two other Redlands players were also 
seeded, making the first 10 spots 
exclusively from UCSD or Redlands. 

The Triton team put forth a good 
show in the tournament until they 
arrived in the quarter finals. 

In the singles division, everyone but 
Metsch fought their way Into the 
semi 's, and then lost some ough match-
es to the opponents from Redlands .

support. . 

Chomsky and Herman hold little hope of significant 
change in government policy in the near future, barnng a 
major shift in power relations within the syslem. They note an 
absurd intransigence reRected in Presi<lent Carter's'claim that 
the US owes Vietnam no war reparations because "the 
destruction was mutual." They do advise concerned 
individuals 10 continue working through nonpartisan human 
rights groups. Their book is not pleasant bedside reading, but 
it deserves careful attention from everyone looking for a way 
out of the current international political nightmare. It is 
meticulOusly documented and absent of jargon and rhetoric. 
Reader. sympathetic with its perspective wiU find a useful 
resource for documenting their opinions. Skeptics will 
encounler a worthy, readable challenge to their views. No one 
will come away from it believing that Third World eruptions 
are attributable merely to communist subversion or religious 
fanaticism, or to the ingratitude of people who grab our· 
generous aid with one hand while stabbing us in the back with 
the other.

Local Delis Rated on 
Price, Atmosphere 
And Quality of Menu 

New Yorkers eat in delicatessens 
more frequendy than in fast food 
places, which means they usually 
ignore places ~t are merely visually 
and economically pleasing. Ralnen is 
by far the most popular deli in 
Manhattan. It is noisy, crowded and' 
expensive, yet you come because you 
know their hot pastrami sandwiches ' 
and cheese blintzes are the best in 

town~ 
San Diegans are a quite different 

Food/Gabriel Gelbart 
breed when it comes to dining out. 
They eat out more o ften, and do so 
more out of desire than necessi ty. 
Attenti o n is placed more on 
atmosphere than on food qual ity. 
Popular eating es ta bl ishments of San 
Diego cater to this inclina tion of 
sensual preference. 

Here is a guide to . La Jollan 
delicatessens that employs the best of 
both judgments in choosing the sublime 
from the mediocre. A good deli should 
have uncompromising food at 
reasonable pnces, as wdl as a nice 
atmosphere. 

For those who have known places 
such as Ratner's, none will be quite as 
satisfactory. But then again, none will 
be quite as unpleasant either.

This is one of my favorites . It has the 

only complete kosher style menu in

Ravor;' however; the preparation of the 
food, and the personality of the people 
who work there give Abe'. a strong 
New York overtone, 

The menu includes such savory 
kosher delicacies as Gefilte fi.h (fish 
patties served cold with horseradish), 
pickled 'herring and potato knishes -
all are a must for anyone not familiar 
with New York cuisine. 

For those less daring, Abe'. also has 
hamburgers, salads and specialty 
sandwiches to choose from . The menu 
goes on a nd on. 

.A hot pastrami sandwich costs 
$2.85, a nd you'll pay $3.95 for 
bagels, lox and cream cheese. The 
prices a re a bit high, but rarely can a 
true kosher deli lover feel so much at 
home in San Diego. ****

not tasteful atiill and sounds like a jack 
hammer after a couple of songs. 

The area was partitioned in such a 
manner that only about a third of it was 
available for seating. About two-thirds 
of that WBI filed. I think I might have 
seen two or three women there. While 
waiting in the wings back.tage, we 
were non-pluued to witnell5two people 
being carried out on stretcher.. A 
group of four roadies examined the 

remainder of a Ai" pack of beer. 
"There's four left," one said. "Let's 
see ... that means one for each of us, 
right?" 
. I am not making any of this up. 

We stood in the backstage area 
throughout most of the show, due to the 
voice of God sound system which could 
have been better put to use as an air 
raid siren for all of California, or better 
yet, as a device for broadcasting civil 
defense.' instructions concerning what 
to do in preparation for the imminent 
arrival of Mahogany Rush . 

-The co ncer t was originally 
scheduled for last Friday night at the 
open-air State College ampitheatre but 
was cancelled due to inclement 
weather. They should have gone on 
with it. The fireworks would .have been 
the most interesting aspect of the sll(\w. 
I have always wanted to see someone, 
specifically Marino, electocuted on 
stage. It cQ.uld only have enhanced hiS 
sound effects. 

Or perhaps Steve Marriot and the 
reformed Humble Pie, who deigned to 
play for about a half an hour' and left 
the stage with no intention of ever 

returning to San Diego, which is OK by 
me. Once " driving force in the early 
70s hard rock scene, original members 
Marriot and Jerry Shirley have added 
ex-Beck vocalist Bob Tench on guitar 
and vocals and someone el§e whose 
name I dont' remember. The result is, 
at best, a result. 

Two other bands, Angel, and Axe 
also played. . . 

The event was billed as a rock 
marathon. I believe the intention of the 
promoter was to award a prize to 
whoever was left at the end, probably a 
brain. There was no winner. 

Only losers.

elegant; it would appear more 
appropriate with the Birkenstock

prices are high, however, even when 
compared to the more stylish delis in

ATC Factory - University Towne 

Center 
A TC is the only franchiser among 

those reviewed, which means the food 
quality is controlled in order to keer up 
a standard. Food is rarely "out 0 the 
ordinary" in these types of eateries 
because it would be difficult for all the 
franchises to simultaneously keep up 
the quality . The sandwiches are good, 
though the french bread is a little stale, 
a bit ironic for a place that is strongly 
reminiscent o~ San Francisco. The 
price range of the sandwiches is about 
average, but the prices for the 

miscellaneous prelerves, wines and 
Ghirarddli chocolates are slightly on 
the high side . ... 

Revelle Deli 
The best thing that Revelle Deli has 

to offer is its low prices. It's also 
conveniently located for faculty and 
students who wish to escape the 
lackluster cuisine of the commons. The 
Poor Boy, a new Orleans submarine 
sandwich creation, is an r excellent 
value at 30¢ an inch, and the roast beef 
is fairly fresh . One has to sacrifice 
atmosphere and comfort, and may 
have to wait for a seat during rush 
hours . It's almost as bad as Ratner' •. 

Law Plan 
Conlinued from page ; • 

Aguilar also contends that i. 'office 
canworlc with officials to get sludenll 
out of jail. The USD 'internship'ciinic, 
Riley said, maintains a 24·hour jail 
consultation plan, thus equaling 
anything presently offered here. 

Riley stressed that the interna, 
comprised of almost all third year law 
students, are letter graded on the 
quality of their performance, not on the 
quantity . 

"It's not just a matter of showing up, 
its a maller of putting out quality work.

Awakenint_ She ia one of the 
few undergraduates to be 
allocated a budget ($250,)

opportunity ~ direct her own

The production, has been 
on a hectic, pressured 
schedule. Wolpe had only four 
days between her , lasl 
performance in The Rivals 
and the beginning of her work 
on this play. In addition, she 
has- had a short six-week 
period to prepare and 
rehearse_

the pressures, and their fint

night revealed an ambitious 
production.

herself, .. diacovered" Frank 
Wedekind's Spring's Awa-
kenin, while Iravelling in 
London. She say. she was 
particularly impressed by the 
play', appeal to modern 
audiences, despite its having 
been written in 1891. 

The play, subtitled "a 
children's tragedy," deals with 
the pain of passing from 
adolescence into adulthood, 
focusing on the role sociely 
plays in the process. The 
theme of sexuality among 
adolescents is explored by 
Wedekind, which caused the

play to be condemned as 
obscene at lhe time of its 
publication, 

The play remains a striking 
psychological study of 
adolescence and a concerned 
commentary on society_ 
Wedekind shows sympathy 

for both children and parents, 
and he offers no easy answers 
to the dilemma of growing up, 
as one character says, in "this 
whirlpool." 

Spring's Awakening is an 
episodically structured play 
that works on a kind of internal 

poetic logic rather than 
realism_ 
Spring's Awakening will run 
May 16, 17 and 18 at the 
John Muir Theatre (HSS 
2250). The production is 
recommended for mature 
audiences .
