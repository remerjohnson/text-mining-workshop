Newly appointed Regent Michael Salerano 

"Baby Regent" does. not 
represent students 

by Lean A. Richter 
New EdItor 

Michael Salerno was christened 
"baby regent" by a smug Edward 
Qlrter at the Sept. UC Regents' 
meeting in Los Angeles. 

Salerno returned the honor. 
"Then you must be grandfather 
regent," he said to the graying 
businessman, and the meeting 
continued. 

A shrewd, often calculating and 
career oriented politician, Salerno 
was appointed to the Board of 
Regents to fill the 1977-1978student 
regent post. . 

"I don't represent the students," 
said the UC Davis law school 
student. Calling t\le role of the 
student regent "a misconception," 
Salerno pointed out that ''there is a 
real distinction between being a 
representative and a trustee." He 
felt that if the Regents had in-
tended the position as a means by 
which students could express a 
collective opinion, they would not 

Admissions 
Challenged 

ating the California Supreme 
Court Bakke case ruling that UC 
special admissions programs for 
minorities are unconstitutional, a 
federal judge last week ordered the 
admission of a white student to the 
UC Davis medical school. 

Rita Clancy, 22, entered clasaes 
at Davis Monday by order of US 
District Judge Thomas MacBride. 
She had been placed at the bead of 
the school 'a waiting U8t. 

Clancy, who graduated from 
UCLA laIt year with an Aavenae, 
said she would have been admitted 
to the ICbooI if a apecIal PI'Oll'8lD

have liven that member a voting 
status. 

Salerno's approach to his 
vobmteer appointment contrasts 
markedly with that . of Daryn 
Peeples, 1~1977 student regent. 
Peeples was an integrated fipre 
at Student Body Presidents' 
Council (SBPC) and other 
meetings, while she also visited 
campuses and prepared for 
Regents' meetings. The un-
dergraduate's classes often took 
second priority while she juggled a 
hectic schedule and five office 
hours each day. 

Consciencious about his law 
studies, Salerno fincb that the 
addition of his regent's duties has 
created ~ "depressing" time 
llmitatioo. He plans to spend 16 
hours weekly preparin, for the 
monthly Reaents' meetings, but is 
still debating about the most ef-
ficient means of utilizing that time. 
Salerno said he would enjoy 
touring the various campuses, yet 
he feela that office time would 
allow better preparation. 

Salerno misses last year's 
pleasure of being able to frequently 
ignore school work so that he could 
"play," in a figurative sense. A 
lover of films, restaurants and the 
beach, he now finds that he barely 
has enough time for sleep, Which 
he frequenUy goes without. He 
bemoaned the fact that he has very 
few chances to do outside reading. 
"There are a lot of things that 
aren't the same," admitted 
Salerno. But he is quick to add that 
he does enjoy the company of his 
fellow regents, even though he has 
little corUct with them. 

A 10Dl time UC student, Salerno 
felt that be bas "a areat deal of 
empathy for what', ,oing on and a 
Imowledle of the UC system." He 
received lU B.A. in pII)'CbolOCY 
and lOdoioo from UC SaJU 
Barbara In 1m, where be .ned

ASSB and participated in the SBPC

UC Davia for a year, Salerno

Court battle in the making? 
Abortion controversy on campus 

by Alaa Runell 
EdItor 

The many headed hydra of 
abortion has struck UCSD in the 
form of two students who have 
withheld their Registration Fee 
payments to ,Protest the portion !>f 
that money 'being used to fund 
abortions for students. 

Albim Rhomberg, an APIS 
(Applied Physics Information 
Science) graduate student, and 
Peggy Patton, a Muir sophomore, 
have placed in trust ,120 fall 
quarter Reg. Fee pay because 
of a non-optional insurance 
program which pays for abortions. 
It is estimated by the ad-
ministration that 275 such abor-
tions were performed last year. 

"It violates my conscience that I 
have to pay for abortions," said 
Rhomberg. "The mandatory fee I 
am forced to pay is not only wrong, 
but, I believe, also illegal." 

The "fee" Rhomberg refers to is 
a $13 per quarter cbarge to 
students for a comprehensive 
health care plan. Under that health 
plan, insured last year by the 
Empire Insurance Company, 
abortions of up to $150 were 
covered, the only requirement 
being that conception had to occur 
while the student was covered by 
the medical plan. None of last 
year's operations was performed 
on campus, as all women involved 
were referred to off-campus 
physicians. 

ynJversity Acted ruegally? 
In challenging the paying of his 

Reg . Fees, Rhomberg stated that 
he believed the University of 
California, operating under the 
constitution of the State of 

California, had violated Article 
nine, Section nine, and thWi had, 
among other things, "gone against 
matters of a religious nature." 

" It seems to me that UCSD made 
an illegal contract with the in-
surance company," said Rhom-
berg. "I don't see how what they've 
done can be a binding condition for 
a student to be a member of the 
University of Qllifomia. They've 
made a serious mistake and 
they're going to have to rectify it." 

Acting Vice-chancellor of 
student Affairs Howard Hunt sees 
the issue of the students 
withholding their fees in a different 
light, saying that the legal 
precedents he had researched 
showed that "individuals cannot 
pick and choose those programs 
they'll support. " 

Hunt stressed that the University 
could not let "two or three dictate 
for the rights of the whole." He 
noted that it would be "difficult 
and self-defeating" to allow 
students the right to select which 
programs they would support and 
which they would not support. 
Citing such programs as 
recreational athletics, in-
tercollegiate athletics, educational 
opportunity programs, and OASIS, 
Hunt said, "IT students could pick 
and choose those programs they 
support, every program would lose 
some of its financial basis because 
not every student would be willing 
to back it." 

Translating the situation to that 
of one outside the University, Hunt 
said, "I can't withhold taxes from

Mort Sahl : More than 
a comic, a conscience 

Getting ahold of Mort Sahl for an 
interv-eiw is about as easy as the 
interview itself. 

Neither is easy. 
When finally tracked down over 

the phone in a Los Angeles health 
club, I couunented to Sahl, "So this 
is where you social critics have to 
spend your time." 

He waan't amused. 
And when I asked him my first 

question it was enough to make 
him observingly note, "You've 
never seen me on stage, have 
you?" And it went on like that. Sabl 
will tell you that a question is 
leading. That I give him no choice 
but to answer, "No, I don 't beat my 

wife anymore." That I leave him 
no grounds but to appear 
egocentric or meek. 

But. .. when Sahl tires of 
dissecting a question or clarifying 
a point, when you lcuk on to those 
buzz words wihch set his com-
bination of anger and wit on edge, 
then you have the legendary Mort 
Sahl, the comedian/social critic 
who has been called the "con-
science of America" for almost 25 
years. 

Sahl, appearing at the Comedy 
store in La Jolla Oct. 5 through 
Oct. 9, labels his viewpoints as 
"interpretation of facts." His

Contraceptive counseling on campus 
Students: Better cautious than sorry 

by Laura A. Richter 
News Editor 

You're away from home for the 
first time. No curfews, no 
restrictions, no parents "atching 
Qver your shoulder. 

You're on your own. 
Don't blow it. 
The UCSD Contraceptive 

Counseling and Education Clinic, 
formerly the Birth Control Clinic, 
located in the Student Health 
Center, provides a range of sexual 
health services for both men and 
women. The staff, headed by 
Sharon Keating, functions 
primarily as an educator in birth 
control as well as in prenatal care 
and family planning. 

Saying that "nothing is ab-
solute," Keating pointed out that 
deciding on a form of con-
traception is left to the woman who 
has attended a mandatory in-
formation session. "It is our 
concern that the individual chooees 
a type of birth control with which 
she is mOlt comfortable and which 
baa the Ieut number of side ef-
fects." 

Nune Pract1tioner Maryann 
Bowman said that obtaining in-
formation or an eDmination does 
not constitute a commitment. 
"We're concerned with con-
fidentiality and with the Individual 
being comfortable with henell," 
~ Bowman. She Itreued that 
wNle she performs the pelvic 
euminations, I)'MCOlogilts are 
available at the cUnic to insure that 

problems are dealt with by 
qualified physicians. 

Keating emphasized the man's 
role and participation in effective 
birth control, commenting that 
men are often very supportive and 
attend information sessions with 
their partners. Condoms are the 
only type of contraception 
available for male use, but the 
female may choose among several 
methods, such as the pill and the 
diaphragm . The intrauterine 

device, rated as third choice by the 
clinic, has been known to cause 
infection and other discomforts, 
but Bowman said that "any type of 
contraception has a considerably 
less risk factor than pregnancy full 
term or abortion." 

The philosophy of the clinic 
personnel is to give the woman 
back her body. "We, hopefully, are 
helping to make a decision. We 
don't make it for her," stressed

StatUI "Up In The AIr" 
Though Rbomberg and Patton 

won't be facing jail sentences for 
their actions, their status is by all 
accounts "up in the air." Hal 
Temmer. Assistant Vice· 
<lIancellor of Admissions and 

~istration, bas returned the two 
their registration fonna with a note 
citing the "incompleteness" of the 
fonna. Because of the extenuating 
circumstances, the Reg. Fee due 
date for Rbomberg and Patton has 
been extended, with no deadlines 
set as of yet. 

The extension was also given to 
Susan Eninger, a recent high 
school graduate who had intended 
to enroll at U<:5D. but because of 
the controversy has changed ber 
mind. 

"I was really looking forward to 
going to school," said Erzinger, 

"The . .. existence of the program Is on enor. 
mous plus lor UCSD. You need 10 get more 
tutors so more Individuals can get specific

" But with the possibility of not 
getting any credit for classes this 
quarter, I decided to stay out. " 

Erzinger added that her con-
science wouldn't permit her to pay. 
and that by doing so ''the whole 
point would be lost." When asked if 
she would attend UCSD if the 
current health policy continues, 
Erzinger said. " I don't think I 
would go." 

The "point." as Erzinger and 
others call it, Is that they do not 
believe any mandatory fees should 
go to paying for abortions. AJ 
Rhomberg puts it. "Of primary 
concern is a moral issue. I . in good 
conscience. am not gong to pay for 
the killing of a unique human In-
dividua1." 

SInce the fees sWl have not been 
paid. the matter has reached a 
head. Hlllt said that his flnt 
concern is that ''the students get in

Rbomberg and PaUon "first had to 
register to bring such a program 
into being." He also expressed 
concern over their missing classes. 

Uaeuy Over SituatJoa 
That feeling does not extend only 

one way; Rhomberg readily ad-
mits that ''the whole situation is 
disturbing to me and my status. I 
don't know what's going to ha~ 
pen." Rhomberg was quick to add. 
though, that, " It would be 
hypocritical to back out because of 
the opposition-no matter how long 
the battle takes." 

Both sides claim they hope to 
avoid a legal battle, but differences 
appear to be growing rather than 
diminishing. An attorney, Burton 
Clwnaky. has been hired by Peggy 
Patton '8 mother In order to gain an 
injunction allowing the students to 
stay on in a "registered" status. It 
II judged by some that this wUJ be 
the springboard for other legal 
action. 

The CQIltroversy stands to grow 
becauae Rhomberg says tbat 
"quite a few" atudera paid their 
Reg. Feea. "unaware" of the 
abortion issue, but have since 
written letters to the ad-
ministration expressing their 
concern with the situation. Hlllt 
admiUed that the administration 
had received "five or six" letters 
from students and parents. 
However. UJere will soon be more 
than letters, said Rhomberg. as he 
had heard from others who, if the 
situation is not resolved, will, ef-
fective nelt quarter, a1io put their 
money in the trust.

try's asleep now," but It's not for 
lack of bIa trying to wake it. By 
chance I likened Sabl to the 
"angry" ancoorman In the movie 
"Network." complete with "I'm 
mad as hell and I'm not going to 
take it anymore." To my 
amazement, Sahl said that 
screenwriter Paddy <lIayefsky 
had modeled the character after 
him. Not surprisingly, Sahl did not 
like the picture. thollgh not 
because of the characler por-
trayal. 

Rather. the movie had those 
elements. particularly the ending. 
which "appealed to liberals." The 
tenn liberal ("What's a liberal?

to Sahl. "I let .. better with

rather have Ronald Reagan judge 
me, or anybody else with a con-

than some liberal. Aren't the 
liberals the ones that left Jack 
Kennedy lying like a dog in the 
street?" 

The problem. as Sahl sees it, is 
that ' 'the liberals have neutered 
this country." He said that "the 
liberals advanced government 
because they thouglt it would 
always be on their side. never 
realizing that it would become 
bigger and start governing our 
lives." Saying that "Congress is 
full of liberals suppressing CIA 
reporta," Sabl noted angrily. ' 'the 
liberals can sleep at night but Jack 
Kennedy can sleep forever." 

Sahl points to the Kennedy 
assassination. citing the fact that 
of the witnesses to the event, over 
100 people have disappeared, been

that he expressed great admiration 
for such figures as Chief Justice

Franklin Roosevelt, John Ken-

Jefferson (who he termed 
"brilliant"), Sabl conunented that 
Ralph Nader (not one of his 
heroes) "would make him get 1000 
dollars in matching fundcJ from 
King George." 

It's not that Sabl doesn·t believe 
in causes. but he says, "We better 
have priorities." He eschews the 
"liberal's priority list" of being 
able to sleep at Digit because 
they've spoken out for pay and

New charter "unrepresentative" -
Is the AS an oligarchy? 

While you were away for the summer, the new 
Associated Students proposed and confirmed a new 
charter for the Student Center Board, the studert 
board which controls tbe entire Student Center. Thi.$ 
new charter, though, contains numerous Daws. The 
two most significant flaws are as follows: 1. First, 
and most important, is the non-repreaentatlve 
membership of thia new charter. 0It m six un-
dergraduate members, tine are presidential 
appointments, one is the AS Vice-President, and the 
other two ate AS council members. This mem-
bership is quite umepresentatiw of the entire 
Iludent populace. 2. Second, space allocatiOllis at 
the full discretion of only Olle person • The Facilities 
Board Chair (instead of the entire Student Center 
Board as was last year.) 

The crux of this dilemma is tbat the AS initiated, 
reworked and finalized this whole proposal wHhe. 
uy consultation with any previous member of the 
Student Center Board or any 01 the College Coun-
cils, who have aiready appointed their represen-
tatives to the Board for this year. This is a blatant 
violation of the rights of the four College Councils 
and of the previous Student Center Board. The 

proposal sboaid have been drawn up oaIy after 
consulting the College Counclla, for these bodies 
have the autbority to appoint members to the 
Board. The AS cannot abrogate this authority 
unless cOll8ultation takes place with the Counclla. 
No written or orai consultation ever took place 
between the AS and tile College Councils or even 
with any previous member of the Board which they 
were attempting to restructure. Furthermore, the 
AS didn't consult, seek advice, or CGnfer with any 
other student group or any students in general who 
utilize tbe facilities accorded by the Student Center. 
U tile AS had consulted with these groups, perhaps 
these Daws would not have surfaced. 

It seems quite clear to us that the AS is gradually 
evolving Into an oligarchy. While asserting their 
power, they are simultaneously omitting valuable 
stOOent input into their deciaions. This is tbe sort of 
elitism which the promoten of the AS so adamanUy 
fought against. Has the AS ~y forgotten some 
of their initial goals? This son., of elitism, tbis 
deliberate separation by and between the AS and

The UC s.n Diep Me &bop Is 
once apia the focal polS for 
statewide COIltrowray. lD • J_ 
letter to the OuInceDor, UC 
Pl'ealcIem Soon offered three 
options for the f.aure of tbe tike 
shop. Servlces could be discon-
tinued, contracted out to area 
buaineumeo, or activities could be 
cuntinued only if justIfted by loca1 
crttics. 

Last February, a few local ~ 
shop owners, repI"eIeIhd by Robm 
Buabam of tbe Soutbern 
Cailfornia Bike Deelen 
AuocIatlon, were llUCCe8lful In 
convinclns the San Diego aty 
Council that bike sales OIl Olr 
campus collllitut.e unfair com-
petltlon wttb small buslneuea In 
tbe community. The owners 
claimed that the. activities had 
been unfairly supported by illite 
lues uaed to fund the Univeraity. 

~ents of the bike shop 
claimed a gJ'Osa sales that neared 
$100,000. Larry Rairden, a 
representative of the bike shop, 
testified that tbe whole operation 
took in $27,000 dollars during 

~e ~e 

0uIdI. He ..... tbat"OW 
mantbly budl« is deIIped .. that 
income es.ctly coven out-
flow ... We try to provide 0"-
CGIJlIJlunlty with a low coil, c0n-
venient source of cycling equip-
ment, but we are not a profit.. 
oriented business, and in a~ 
solutely no way do we encoarage 
sales to those who an not mero-
ben of our campua community. " 

By a vote m 5-4, witb ~ JoUa 
CowlcUman GO Jollllon In favOl", a 
reaoIuUon WII tralllllDiUet:I to the 
UC Board m Reienta. It ... 
requested ..... tbIt the bicycle ... 
activity beJn& CGDducted by the 
Univenity m Califamia, San Dteco 
be tenninated, but tbat emergency 
repair actlvtty be permitted to 
continue." 

Since that time, the bDre shop baa 
limited aalea to faculty, Iludenta, 
and staff who must pramt an l.d. 
The 10 percent discount that bad 
once been given to bike coop 
memben W8I elimInated. The bike 
shop also now pays a $240.00 dollar 
per month rent for tbe space that is 
used in the Student Center. 

President Saxon is currently 
preparing a response to tbe City 
CoWicil. In conjunction with the 
bike shop and Acting Vice Ulan-
cellor of Student Affairs Howard 
Hunt, the OtanceDor has recom-
mended a strong position in su~ 
port of student views on the bike 
shop. He sets the continued 
operation of the bike shop as a 
campus priority based upon the 
important service the bike shop 
provides to the student com-
munity. "I believe that if we were 
to close the bike shop because of 
outside pressure, and not because 
we no longer see it as a valid and 
necessary service, we would set a 
dangerous precedent regarding 
our right to run any student 
auxiliary service." 

Lit/Sp 121: THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD: POESIA EPICA Y 
ROMANCERO. Tu·Th: 10:30 -11 :50 -- TIH 302 -- CC5222. 
Instructor: Maria Eugenia lacarra . 

The Bike shop may be closed due to pressures from local business-
men. 

Direct commWlication between 
the UC President and the City 
CoWicil might reduce the intense 
focus on the bike sop. It does not 
end the growing community 
concern over UC operation of 
auxiliary enterprises which may 
compet~ with the private sector. In 
the face of rwnored legislation in 
Sacramento and a management 
audit by the Auditor General, UC 
President Saxon has established a 
systemwide Task Force to 
examine Univenity~rated and 

student~rated activities. 
This Task Force will evaluate 

the need in the context of available 
alternatives for such services as 
" ... ('esidence halls, food services, 
intercollegiate athletics ... , college 
unions I college stores, and other 
services, such as fibn series, 
concerts, bike shops, and the like." 
Representatives of the Task Force 
will visit ~e San Diego Campus in 
the first week ·of October.

ASUCSD chaUenged CoadDued from p.,e 3 thinks be baa every iig~ to ask the questions. He believes hia duty is 

not to take sides on an issue, but 
ratber act so that the matters don't 
become dormant. He lJid that 
those like hlmaelf, who have 
vocally asked questions; "Have 
stopped the war in Viet Nam, have 
shown that the Warren commiaaion 
was fraudulent, and revealed that 
the intelligence agencies are

WhEEL ANd DEAL AT ThE t 
UCSD BikE Shop I 

Lut Spring quarter, the Iludenta 
in a campUl-Wide govemmerUl 
referendum voted to replace ~ 
StOOent Cooperative Union model 
of govermneni witb an Associated 
Stooenta model of government . 
Since that time, as eledions have 
been held, and the duly elected 
officers have assumed their m-
fices. Since taking office, the 
elected officiall have perpetrated 
what are in my mind, a number of 
abuses of power against the 
student body of U~D. 

The purpose of this letter is to 
comment upm one of these in an 
attempt to make you aware of what 
has happened. I choose the one 
incident because I feel it deeply 
effects the viability of student 
activism on this campus I and 
because I find it to be an Ideal 
illustration of what the AS has been 
up to since being elected to office. 

On the top floor of the main 
building of the Student Center is an 
area which was fonnerly known as 
student Organizations. It was in 
this area that many if not most of 
the organizations founded and 
operated by students carried out 
their business. 

Since the Associated Students 
have assumed office, they have 
unilaterally removed all student 
organizations from this area, save 
a select few such as the powerful 
Advisory Committee for Student 
Fee Programs, a conunittee which 
really has the last say as to how the 
AS spends its monies. No wonder 
they allowed the ACSFP to stay! 
Because they have taken all of the 
office space for themselves, they 
have deprived other student 
organizations from the use of a 
phone and a receptionist, 
privileges that all students pay for 
through the quarterly activity fee . 

When the Coop was in office, I 
recall that they operated out of one 
of the many offices in Student 
Organizations. I will grant you that 
the AS is a larger and more 
detailed govenunent, but all of the 
offices? Come on . The past 
govenunent realized that the 
central student government is but 
one of the many important student 
groups that operate on a Univer· 
sity campus. 

I wish to make it clear that ram 
not ' arguing with the mandate 
handed to the Associated Students 

the student body. I fully respect

the student's wiabe.. Nor am I 
making an effort to revive the 
Student Cooepratlve Union; 
frankly, I did not vote for them in 
the referendum. Rather, my sole 
intention is to let the AS know that 
there' are students on this campus 
who will not stand for abuses of 
power such as the one mentioned in 
this letter. The students ousted the 
Coop because they had no respect 
for it. 

I fully believe that the 
Associated Students is inviting the · 
same fate if they do not learn that 
they are not all there is to student 
involvement on this campus . It is 
true that we learn by our mistakes. 

Well, ASUCSD, you have made a 
mistake. I truly hope that you will 
benefit from it.

There is no disputing the fact 
that we learn much about our-
selves from other people, even 
fro~ those whose thoughts , 
feelings, and experiences differ 
greatly from our own. This 
premise lies at the core of the 
perfonner/audience interaction in 
performance art. Performance 
offers the artist a chance to 
examine his own experiences and 
feelings and share them with the 
audience by acting them out. 

Last Wednesday, at a forum 
sponsored by the United Artists 
Coalition (UAC), Norma Jean 

'J~l~ 

Deak, MaryLou Blankenburg, and 
linda Montano presented their 
most recent works in performance. 
Each piece was highly personal 
yet universal in appeal. The to: 
timacy inherent in live per-
formances promoted an insightful 
look at the artist and, more im-
portantly, at the human experience 
she prOjected. 

Norma Jean Deak's per-
rormance, entitled "Travel Log" 
took the ronn of a narration that 
was supplemented by slides and 
excerpts from letters and a diary. 
The piece was presented as a 
reenactment of Deak's recent trip 
to Europe; the diary and letters to

home acted as records of her state 
of mind at the time of her stay 
there. The significance of the 
presentation revolved aroood the 
idea of disconnection . The letters 
put across a very content and 
tra~uil image of her experience, 
while the passages from the diary 
revealed feelings rl depression and 
paranoia . The audience was 
confronted with the problem of 
deciding which account of her trip 
was more valid and, in the end 
which impression was a reflectio~ 
of the "real" woman. Deak's vucal 
and facial transformation, which 
accompanied the role changes 
from narrator to author rl the 
letters to author tl the diary to 
characters in the slides, were 
especially effective in defining the 
element of disconnection involved 
and were often very humorous. 

Marylou Blankenburg revealed 
her feelings about repression In our 
school systems by dancint them 
out to a recording of henelf 
speaking on the subject. Her words 
delCl'ibed the deb1D8DJzation tl

Auditions open to all 
Casting tonight, tomorrow 
for three UCSD productions 

by JIlllAuile Bueley 
ArtIIWriter 

The UC San Diel{o drama department will hold 
auditions tonight and tomorrow night at 8 o'clock in 
the U~D Theatre ror the first three productions of 
the 1977-78 season. Dr. Jorge Huerta will direct a 
special version of Arthur Miller's "A View from the 
Bridge" to be produced in the UCSD Theatre; Dr. 
Floyd Gaffney will direct the new John Muir 
Theatre Ensemble's production of a new translation 
of Euripides' " The Bacchae " in the recently con-
verted John Muir Theatre (HSS 2250) ; and in MC 
409, JeMifer Parent will direct a graduate 
production for three women entitled "Slag" by 

. David Hare. 
The auditions are open to all UCSD students and 

all three plays will be handled in the same session. 
Auditioners are advised to be familiar with the 

. material , and especially with the versions being 
used . Scripts for " A View from the Bridge" and 
"Slag" are available for overnight checkout from 
Paula Shetula or Jane Bayer at the drama depar-
tment office, MC 4f11. "The Bacchae" can be foond 
in the UCSD bookstore. 

Production dates are: "A View from the Bridge," 
Nov. 1G-13 and Nov. 1~~; "The Bacchae," Dec. 1 ... 
and "Slag," Nov. 16-19. 

Of his production of "A View from the Bridge," 
Huerta notes that a west coast milieu gives new 
dimensions to the tragedy of a common man driven 
to self-destruction as his primal desires CUDe Into 
violent conflict with modem realities. One change 
that Huerta, a leader rl the Teatro Wcano 
movement makes is to transform the character 
Eddie Carbone into Eddie carranza In an effort to 
ma~e the play relevant to the Wcano people. Both 

Oticano arut non..Q\icano actors are sought for the 
play. 

"The Bacchae" is being produced in coordination 
with the Drama 41, 42 and 43 sequence. Besides 
using a fresh translation, it is possible that Gaffney 
may create even more interest by the addition of 
Mrican ritual. Designed to go along with the 
productiOns of the John Muir Theatre Ensemble is 
the drama course for non-majors, Theatrical 
process/events. According to teaching assistant 
JeMifer Parent, the purpose of the course is to 
create an educated audience. Basic requriements 
for the course this quarter are attendance at one 
rehearsal of "The Bacchae " and at one section per 
week . 

"Slag," says Parent, " is about institutions, 
feminism, womens' relationships with women and 
the inability to deal with reality ." "Slag" presents 
to UCSD the current movement in theatre to 
recognize the female voice in me. 

The 1977-78 UCSD Theatre season is composed of 
four main stage productions (including "A View 
from the Bridge") plus one special bonus produc-
tion, " Christmas in October," reaturing Eric 
Christmas. The student subscription rate for the 
entire season is $7.50; staff, $10.00 and general, 
$12.00 Regular ticket prices are students, $2.50 and 
general, $3.50. Enthusiasts may also join Frlend'J of 
the U~D 1beatre,wlth varying membership fees 
starting at $20.00. -, 

Drama at UCSD is consistently exceUent and is 
one rl the best theatre buys in San Diego. Because 
of the pmessional quality of the faculty, the modest 
budget and the technical limitations of the UCSD 
1beatre, the productions are always Intimate, in-
ventive and never overdone.

1M sign-ups 
to be held 
this week 

By Doug Robina 
Staff Writer 

Sign-ups for the various in-
tramural sports are being held 
through Friday, October 7 in the 
recreation gymansiwn conference 
room, with schedules for captain 
meetings available now in the 
intramural office. 

1M sports offered this quarter 
include the traditional flag football 
(men. women and coed). three on 
three basketball (men and 
women), volleyball (coed) and 
team tennis (coed), as well as two 
special events . 

New Levels of CompetlUoD 
Mike Hipp and Lee Johnson, who 

head the 1M program, have 
changed the levels of competition 
from the A. B, C and D leagues of 
previous years to A. AA and AAA 
(with triple A maintaining the 
highest level of competition). Post" 
season play-{)ffs with the overall 
championship team's photo in-
stalled in the 1M hall of fame. 
located in the intramural office. 

Strong emphasis by the par_ 
ticipants is placed on winning, but 
due to the absence of trophies and 
awards. studetns usually compete 
for enjoyment of sport rather than 
accolades. 

May Stude ... Compete 
According to Hipp, ap-

proximately sixty percent IJf the 
total student population (un-
dersraduate and sraduate) 
compete in one program or 
another. Most students are in-
volved in 1M sports II an outlet of 
tension. frustration and release of 
anxiety frOOl the studyins and 
clasaes during the week. Of course. 
studera also compete for the pure 
thrllI of victory wbidt is a part of 
competitive sporta.

We teach you how to achieve your potential 

Check into Bank of America. 
Our CoDege Plan 
is made for students. 
Lets begin at the beginning. . 

The first thing every student needs is a no-nonsense checking 
account. And in that category, our College Plan® Checking Account 
is pretty tough to beat. 

For just $1 a month for the nlne-month school ye~, you get , 
unlimited checkwriting, with no minimum balance reqUired. Theres 
no service charge at all for June, July, August, or for any month you 
maintain at least a $300 minimum balance. You get our 
Timesaver® Statement every month_ And your account stays open 
through the summer, even with a zero balance, saving you the 
trouble of having to close it at the end of the school year, and re-
open it in the fall. Complimentary personalized regular checks are 
available, or premium checks may be purchased. 

BANK OF AMERICA NT&SA. MEMBER FDIC 

To shed a little more light on the subject, all our branches 
also offer an arra!! of free Consumer Information Reports. Includ-
ing "A Guide to Checks and Checking:'which explains what you 
need to knO\N about cashing and depositing checks, holds and stop-
payment procedures. 

Now. that's not all the bank you'll ever need. And it's certainly 
not all the bank we offer. But it does make for a good start. 

We also offer a wide variety of other banking services y?u . 
might find useful, both in school and after. So why not check In With
