Reinecke Criticizes UC Teaching load; 
Regents Hear IV Proiect Called Failu re 

Acting Governor Ed 
Reinecke charged Friday that 
UC faculty are not teaching 
enough and said the Reagan 
Administration would attempt 
to enforce a heavier teaching 
load when it submits the Uni-
versity's 1972-73 operating 
budget early next year. 

Reinecke said during the UC 
Regents . meeting in Los 
Angeles that the average 
teaching load for UC professors 
had dropped from 6.5 hours to 

six hours per week from fall 
1969 to fall 1970. Data from a 
state audit currently being 
prepared indicate the average 
declined even more last year . 

" If each professor would 
teach just one more hour per 
week it would save some $13 
million per year." he said. 

campuses. asked the Regents 
to spend only $13 million of 
tuition money on building while 
devoting $8 million to student 
financial aid . 

COMPROMISE REACHED 

The students were supported 
by Regent William Coblent~ . 
He claimed that today s 
students should not have to 
finance buildings for future UC 
students. The board finally 
compromised. agreeing to 
spend at least $19 million on 
construction while reserving 
$2.7 million for possible use as 
student financial aid . 

Regents Approve $397 Million Budget 

During a press conference 
following the meeting. UC 
President Charles Hitch 
commented that the hours 
spent in the classroom or 
laboratorv are "not an 
adequate 'measure of faculty 
teaching loads." Professors 
also spend much time in 
tutorials. conferences and 
other teaching activities not 
considered part of a formal 
teaching load. 

In other action the Board 
ordered General Counsel 
Thomas Cunningham to 
investigate whether UC student 
lobbyists should be allowed to 
accept donations from tax . 
exempt foundations . 

A faculty pay raise of 13.3 per 
cent is included in C 
President Charles Hitch 's 
budget for 1972-73. which asks. 
$397.4 million in State funds . 
Hitch's budget. which holds as 
its highest priority " the 
improvement of undergraduate 
instruction." was approved by 
the UC Regents last Friday. It 

, must now be passed by the 
State Legislature. 

Hitch 's proposed budget of 
$397.4 million is the second of 
three alternative budgets he 
drew up for presentation to the 
Regents. The first was an 
" austerity level " budget. 
which asked $377.1 million. 
540.6 million more than the 
state 's 1971-72 appropriation. 
This figure . however. would 
provide only for increases on 
fixed expenditures due to 
inflation. as well as a few 
workload increases . The 
austerity level budget 'would 
not restore any of the program 
reductions the niversity has 

had to make during the past 
three years. In these years. 
Hitch says. " the University has 
had to live virtually within the 
same state appropriation - the 
state has disregarded recent 
Regents ' budgets. This means 
that inflation and enrollment 
increases have had to be met 
by reducing and eliminating 
certain programs." 

Summer Quarter Axed 
As a result of these 

limitations .. UC has had to 
eliminate the Summer 
Quarter. decrease library 
hours and acquisitions by about 
15 percent each. eliminate 
state support for University 
Extension. delete 480 faculty 
positions in the total 
University. and raise the 
student·faculty ratio by 21 
percent. 

In the last year alone. 
Berkeley. UCLA. and Santa 

Barbara have lost a total of 217 
faculty positions so that needs 
for additional faculty at the 

McGovern Apologizes 
for Population Inaction 

" Environmental Law and 
Overpopulation" was. the 
theme of the first annual 
California Zero Population 
Growth Conference held at the 
UCSD School of Medicine last 
Saturdav and Sundav. Senator 
Georg'e Mc·Govern . 
Democra tic presidentia I 
candidate. apologized to an 
audience of 400 Saturda\' for his 
inactivitv on environmental 
problems. 

Other speeches included 
Richard RypiDski on "Control 
of Land Use": Peter John 
Ames on "Your Bod\'. Your 
Decision" : and Nicholas C. 
Yost on " Population 
Stabilization. " During the 
afternoon. six workShops were 
held. coverinjf : Abortion and 
Sterilization : Status and 

Pro~ress : Public 
Education/Speakers for ,ZPG : 
Law and Land Use : Citizen 
Action: and Lobb~'inll and 
Population Stablilization. 

Ml'Govern stated that "the 
population bomb is a more 
dan~('I'ous threat than an~' 
possible threat that might be 
mounted b,· Hanoi. Havana. 
Peti", or ~IOIa)w . He nrned 
that " we're headed for 
catast~ on the front of 
famirw and political chaOl. 
e't'OIIOInic dlstrns and tM 

worst kind of social conditions 
around the globe if we do not do 
vastlv more in this area ." 

McGovern added that. " All 
of us must make a greater 
personal commitment to 
assure a happy future for our 
children ." He feels that 
Americans bear a heavier 
responsibility due to the 
"enormous consumption and 
waste spill-off from an affluent 
societ\'. 

"I "'ant to plead quilty here 
toda~' for not having done 
ellough. on this front. " 
declared McGovern. " I'll trv to 
do better in the future :' He Said 

hi~ bbsession" to end the war in 
Indochina has diverted his 
attent~n " that would 
otherwise have gone to 
population control. " 

Ml'Govern stated that we are 
reai1~' now " to accept Vie ZPG 
concept as a national and 
international goal. " He said 
that if elected he would bellin a 
massive educational and 
informational campaiarr'which 
would encourage fami1~'

birth control devices that 
would not conflict with current 
reli.ious teachinlls. He also 
sullested the use of 400 million 
dollars to begin researchin, 
population control problems. 

smaller campuses could be 
met : this came just after 
Berkeley and UCLA had lost 
380 positions as a result of 
cancellation of the Summer 
Quarter. 

Hirch 's second alternative. 
the one he asked the Regents to 
approve. asks $397.4 million in 
state aid . This is $60.3 million 
more than the 1971-72 
appropriation. " Th is 
alternative does not fulfill all of 
the University's most urgent 
needs. " Hitch emphasized. 
" but it does enable the 
University to reverse the 
direction of thl? last three 
years. It will only provide 
a minor amount of relief for 
our most pressing needs". ". 

The third alternative asked 
$414 million from the state. an 
increase of $76.9 million over 
this ~·ear . According to Hitch. 
this amount would be a 
"modest budget based on 
standards well below those 
prevailing in the mid·60·s.·· 
Hitch said that although tbe 
third alternatiye is "highly 
desirable. I feel that it cannot 
be obtained in one year : but. 
we must at least move in that 
direction." Thus. he chose to 
request the second alternative 
budget so that the Universitv 
could at least begin to reverse 
what he had earlier termed "a 
trend toward medocrity. " 
Underllraduate Education 

. Stressed 
Under the proposed 1972·73 

budget. the highest priority 
would be improvement of 
undergraduate instruction and 
relief of the common situation 
in which students are unable to 
get their dellrees due to the 
inavailability of classes. Some 
aspects of the second 
alternative plan are : 

11 Student-facult,· ratios 
would decline from ' 17.4: 1 in 
1971-72 to 17.1: still the highest 
of any year except this ~·ear . 
21 A 51 million increase would 
be inclu<ted for the continued 
instructional use of computers. 

31 Librar~' hours would be 
restored to the 1971-72 Rel/ents ' 
budl/et level. Other -services. 
such as utilities and janitorial 
services. would also be 
restored. 

41 An additional 11 million 
would be desi~nated for 
financial aid for the Economic 
Opportunit~· ProJram : no state 
funding is cumntl~' provided. 
Governor Re .. an vetoed the 
III million added ~. tM State 

" . 

Legislature to last year 's 
budget. ) 

5) A school of law would be 
established at Santa Barbara. 
and a school of administration 
at Davis. 

6) An additional 130 faculty 
would be provided for the 
health sciences programs at 
Davis. Irvine. Los Angeles. San 
Diego. and San Francisco. 

7) An additional $3 million 
would be allocated to organized 
research into such fields as air 
pollution . health care.. and 
environment. 

Student-Faculty Ratio Up 
Since 1960-67. enrollment at 

UC has increased 33 percent 
• while faculty positions have 

only increased 7 percent. 
Despite a 4.5 percent increase 
in enrollment in 1971-72. it was 
necessary to eliminate 100 
faculty positions . cut 
instructional support hy 5 
percent. and library support by 
5750.00Q. because no increase in 
state support was provided. 

Hirch foresees " widespread 
deterioration in our programs 
if we do not receive a 
substantial increase ". the 
1971·72 budget is completely 
inadequate ... 

The University could 
probably continue to enroll all 
eligible undergraduates in 
California. but its character. 
according to Hitch. would 
change drastically: " It would 
be a sterile Universitv." 
, Whatever budjZet ' is finally 
approved by the Sta te 
Lellislature. the Re~ent will 
be eXp('cted to come up with 
$16.3 million to augment it. 
accordinJZ to Hitch 's proposal. 
The Regents ' funds are derived 
from the overhead on federal 
contracts and grants. half of 
which goes to assist in 
financing the operation of the 

Universit~· and half of which 
supports Regents' Special 
ProjZrams. These include 
student aid and educational 
enrichment prollrams. as well 

. as facult~· study. teaching 
assistant loans . anct the 
President's Contingency'tund . 

The total expenditure budllet 
for rc is expected to amount to 
about 1924.8 million altogether. 
and will be rounded out by 
Ilrants from the 'State of 
California and the Federal 
Government. as well as 
endowments. gifts. and private 
funds. 1271.8 million will be 
brou.bt in through the three 
major AEC contracts. 

The discussion of teaching 
load came as the Regents 
approved a requested budget of 
$397.4 million in state operating 
funds for the 1972-73 academic 
year. a $60 million increase 
over the current vear. 

OPPOSITION OVERRULED 

The Board also approved a 
request of $73 million in state 
funds and student tuition 
income for construction 
purposes in the next academic 
year. despite opposition from 
students and some Regents. Of 
the $73 million. $54 million is 
designated for the eight UC 
general campu~es and $19 
million is for new health 
science facilities . However. the 
enactment of this budget 
depends upon several funding 
sources - passage of the 
University's proposed $296 
million health science bond 
issue in ovember 1972 and on 
the availability of construction 
money from the state 's 
tidelands oil fund . Without such 
fu nding. the construction 
program would again be 
reduced to income from 
student tuition money. 

The Regents requested $56.9 
million for this academic year 
for construction and received 
none. This year they are 
spending $23.9 million in tuition 
money on building projects. 

When President Hitch 
proposed that another $21.7 
million of tuition money be 
earmarked for buiiding 
purposes next year. Steve 
Chadima . student body 
president at UC Irvine. 
objected. Chadima. speaking 
for AS presidents on all nine 

The Regents also heard 
conflicting reports a bou t 
progress in solving some of the 
problems in Isla Vista . the 
communitv near UC Santa 
Barbara .' La st year the 
Regents approved the spending 
of S6OO.000 in special Regents' 
funds to effect reforms in the 
community which has been the 
scene of rioting in recent years. 
Thus far . only about $300.000 
has actually t>een allocated and 
only $108.600 has been spent. 
UCSB Chancellor Vernon I. 
Cheadle and former Vice-
Cl)ancellor Ray Varley said the 
allocations have ·. improved 
conditions in Isla Vista . 

But Mike Salerno. executive 
vice - president of the ASUCSB. 
and Cliff Harrison. a non -
student member of the Isla 
Vista Communitv Council. told 
the Regents their spending 
program has been a failure and 
that Isla Vista could evolve into 
another Haight - Ashbury 
district. Salerno and Harrison 
charged that the University. 
through the UCS B 
administration and the General 
Counsel's Office in Berkeley. 
has delayed many worthwhiie 
projects in bureaucratic red 
tape. They also cri~ed the 
lack of faculty and staff 
involvement in isla Vista and 
attributed to it the dangers of 
tenure denial and delav of 
academic promotions. . 

After discussion of this 
contradi tory information the 
Regents asked President Hitch 
to report to the board soon on 
further steps to implement Isla 
Vista reforms.

Third College Helps to Expand 
Student's Growing Self-Awareness 

Tommy Ca/im •• 
Third College has been a focal point for academic and 

political controversy ever since its inception two years ago. 
Attended by students of all races, this college is a center for 
Third World and urban studies. 

However. regardless of monetary cutbacks. the college has 
been doing some beautiful and innovative educating. An 
analysis of the course content brings to light many worthwhile 
features. 

Third College has a rather unique and profound history. Its 
history includes many encounters between local government, 

s~te .government and university officials opposed by a 
minority of Black and Brown students. Angela Davis for 
example, was one of those students who demanded that a 
college devoted to the Third World be established at UCSD. 

Third World Studies : this program is the most controversial 
subject matter of the college. Many of the attacks on Third 
World Studies have come from people who will never have an 
indepth perspective of Africans. Chicanos. Orientals and native 
Americans. The basic aims and goals of this course sequence 
are the' study of the Third World. introspectively. with an 
emphasis on its people inside and outside the United States. 
The first quarter usually deals with history of people in Asian. 
African and Latin-American countries as they came into 
contact with European countries. According to the course 
description. "the focus will be on the establishment of the 
colonial relationship ... 

According to the original demands that were presented , 
Third College would be "devoted to relevant education for 
minority youth and to the study of contemporary social 
problems of all people." The structure of the college would 
have to be radically different from that of traditional 
American universities and colleges. The innovative plan 
covered the ~inds of courses taught and included student input 
In the selectJ(~n of faculty and the overall objectives of Th ird 
College. "To do this authentically." stated the demands. ,· this 
collel!e must radically depart from the usual role as the 
idea logical bacl<bone of the social system. and must subject 
every part of the system to ruthless criticism. ,. 

Third College is now a genuine, tangible reflection of this 
original purpose. Third World, Third College students can be 
seen in abundunce throughout UCSD. Yet, there is still some 
criticism that not "enough " students of the Third World 
comrrrunity are enrolled in Third College. This complaint is 
indeed quite valid. On the other hand. there are many factors 
which substantiate the reasons behind this shortage in Third 
World students. For example. there have been enormous 
cutbacks in funding of the Educational Opportunities Program (EOP) . 

Science and Technology: this program includes the 
fundamentals of biology. chemistry. physics and the health 
sciences. Third World students will be trained to become 
competent professional scientists and technologists, and will 
obtain preparation for medical school and related areas . "The 
relationship of these disciplines to the human organism and its 
environment is stressed. " says the description. Also. all Third 
College students are required to complete two quarters of 
mathematics. regardless of major . 

TT editors notice 
News Analysis will be a regular feature of 

the TRITON TIMES designed to give staff 
writers an opportunity to analyze aspects of 
the Universitv about which thev are 
particularly concerned . . 

In an effort to stimulate discussion of the 
issues. News Analysis articles will contain a 
minimum of editing and will thus contain 
opinions and judgments which would not be 
present in the regular news columns. 

TheTRITONTIMES invites comments and 
discussion of the issues raised in News 
Analvsis articles . 

Third College . a unique experiment in 
minority education. opened one year ago . 
Here two TRITON TIMES staff writers 
present their views on the college. 

Urban and Rural Studies: this program has as its major 
objectives "the urbanization process from various points of 
view about society. from radical to conservative. noting how 
such outlooks are reflee,ted in problem definition . analysis and 
solution." An exploration of rural life and its link with 
urbanization will also be made. also seekini! concrete 
solutions. (eoatiDued on JIIge 3) 

The Fruits of a Political Struggle or 
Third ~ollege-Selling Out its Own 

lim Sills 
UCSD's Third College came to life on May 7. 1969. when a 

group of students from MAYA I Mexican-American Youth 
Association ) and the BSC I Black Students ' Council I broke into 
and occupieiJ the Registrar's Office on Matthews Campus. 
These students sent an ultimatum to the facultv senate . then in 
session. to pass the Third College plan desired by these 
students or else. That ame day. moments later . the faculty did 
vote to completely change the academic plan 01 what was to 
become Third College . 

This little bit of hi story heds considerable light on the 
present course of Third College . The college owes its existence 
to politics and intimidation. not to reason or academic merit. 
In this sub titution of politics lor education. the present 
directors 01 the college cheal many persons : the campus. the 
taxpayers . and most especially their own students. 

Why are such seemingly harsh criticisms made of a college 
which declares itself to be the champion o[ America's 
minorities ' Why have such respected national columnists as 
Jefferv Hart. Rowland Evans and Robert Novak. and Willard 
Edwards commented unfavorably on his "hope for the Third 

World "~ 
TRITON TIMES Racist? 

Racism? Well. this charge has been made against everyone 
who has criticized Third College. even some who haven ·t. The 
TRITO;\f TIMES was banned from coverage of Third College 
Assembly meetings last year for its reports on that body's 
meetings. Judge for yoursell . 

Third College ma\' be viewed on two levels. the 
organizational and the educational. Let 's take orl!anization 
lir t: an essential ingredient in Third College 's philosophy is

racial identity . A student is not Joe Jones fir t. but rather an 
Asian . or a ;\fa live-American I Indian I. or a Black . or a Brown. 
Thus. when it comes time to elect members of Third College's 
tudent government. the voting is on racial lines. Three 

students are elected to the college's Board of Directors. As 
written in a by-law approved last year. one of those three must 
be Black. Another must be Chicano. with the third seat rotating 
among Asians. Indians . and white . The topper . however. is 
that a Black student voting in this election can only vote for a 
Black student. Similarly . only Chicanos can vote for Chicanos. 
and so on . One does not. at Third College. vote on the basis of 
principle. 01 personality. or philosophy : one votes on the basis 
of race. 

Curriculum 
Through different techniques. but to the same end . much of 

the Third Collel!e curriculum develops this racial feeling . The 
political nature of the curriculum can be judged from the 
following representative sample of quotes from text books 
used at Third College over the past two years: 

Third World Studies - "Like all imperialisms. the thrust of 
American imperialism takes military. political. and economic 
thrusts." " ... the State Department must consult the opinion 
of the one thousand Americans t bankers. industrialists. 
businessmen. and pubHshers I who are really the ones who 
govern the U.S.A." "Mao is the leader. not only 01 China. but 
a Iso of the colored peoples. amonl! whom the most important 
people are the Negroes and persons 01 mixed ancestry in the 
U.S." The se lection of authors considered " representative" of 
the Third World is restricted to the likes 01 Kwame ·krumah . 
Ho Chi Minh. Juan Bosch. and Che Guevara . Third World

In other words. the Third 

College curriculum reduces to 
a post-/!:raduate course in 
political orllanizing : in 
expanding the political conlllct 
which has in the past disrupted 
this campus. The situation 
would be as reprehensible in a

contribute anything of value to 
society or to its students. it 
must' be a center of 
disinterested learning. not a

political activities . With a

Is Jesus Just Another Bad Trip? 

We Don't Get 
Fooled Again 

By WI;IUam H. SIoddard 
This summer. I visited this 

campus a few limes. On one of 
these visits. I met two Black 
men. one of whom. Myles 
Proctor, is a student at this 
college whom I had previously 
met. Proctor addressed me as 
a 'neo-fascist· . I attempted to 
eXp'lain. briefly. that my 
pllliosophical position is in fact 
philosophical anarchism. one 
which is more opposed than 
any other to anything 
resembling fascism. The other 
Black then said he wanted to 
ask me a question : I told him I 
was willing to answer it, 
whereupon he lectured me for 
ten minutes, on the general 
inferiority of white men and 
my own special inferiority as 
proved by my unsuitedness to a 
social order of pure violence. 
(This, incidentally, has never 
been advocated by any 
anarchist ; the anarchist social 
tbeory advocates purely 
peaceful and voluntary 
cooperation.) In conclusion, he 
seized my glasses and 
threatened to smash them ; 
struck me in the face : and then 
explained that I was unworthy 
even of being assaUlted. . 

Recently. I was on Ma tthews 
Campus. buying a text. Another 
Black student. Vincent Hollier . 
came up to me and told me that 
I had been 'snooping around 
Third College' II have not gone 
there this quarter. except to 
pay fees and buy books ). He 
told me that he didn 't want me 
around there. since I have 
written articles for Dimension, 
and told me. in effect. that he 
would beat the shit out of me if 
I want there again. He then 
rejoined Proctor . who was 
standing nearby. 

I have heard many elaborate 
accounts of the' freedom 
possible under socialism. many 
denunciations of the slavery of 
free enterprise. [ shall not 
discuss the historical evidence 
against these arguments : but I 
think it worth mentioning that 
none of the staff of Dimension, 
despite their radical 
disagreement With my views. 
has ever threatened me lor to 
my knowledge anyone else I 
with anv form of violence. I 
have 'twice now been 
threatened bv Black socialists. 
Earlier. [ have been told that 
socialism would put me and 
others like me on the bollom. 
where we could be oppressed. I 
can only remark that the 
peacef ui and libertarian 
surface of the socia list 
movement is largely a rraud , 

This is hardl~' surpris ing. 
Socialism. as a philosoph~·. 
calls for the subordination of 
the individual to a moral law 
defined b\' the State . 
Economicall\:. it demands the 

expropriation of individual 
property. acquired by first 
occupancy. gift. or trade, and 
peacefully used . and the 
compulsory participation of all 
men in a single giant 
monopolistic corporation, the 
State. This ould hardly be 
achieved without violence : nor 
does the socialist philosophy. 
typically, have any objection to 
such violence. 

The socialist idea of freedom 
could be summed up as: 
freedom is the power to exploit 
and subjugate all other men. 
gained by participating in that 
apparatus of exploitation 
known as the State. Men such 
as Hollier and Proctor - or 
such greater figures as Lenin, 
Mao. Hitler - have every 
intention of gaining control of 
that apparatus. Having done 
so. their response to any 
innovation. criticism. or self -
assertion would be and has 
been precisely what I have met 
with : deprivation. 
intimidation. assault. They 
have no interest in creating 
anything new. but simply in 
taking over what other men 
have built. and trapping men 
for all time in a sterile pattern 
of robbery and enslavement. 

I am an artist. a scientist. a 
philosopher ; I am not a 
specialist in violence and 
fraud . I have no desire to be 
involved in the perpetual 
struggle for meaningless power 
which everv socialist from 
Nixon to Mao has brought 
about. I don 't think most people 
are aware of the choice. But 
the choice is there: to tolerate 
and even seek out diversity. 
letting each man develop h'is 
own wa\' of life without 
interference - which would 
result in evervone's liberation. 
in the onl~' meaningful sense of 
the word - or to give way 
before th e c laim s of 
irresponsible hoodlums. which 
can onlv lead to a perpetual 
war or a totalitarian 
dictatorship. Th is campus has 
its own such thuj1s: I have met 
them . Let them know that \'ou 
oppose them . and see what the\' 
say to you. or what they do to 
vou . Remem ber. when the 
socialists speak of taking over. 
these are the kind of men the\' 
would put in charl!e of you'r 
lives. and the lives of Blacks 
and Chicanos and women : 
those whose primar~' skills are 
public fraud. assault. theft. 
politic al barj1aininj1 . and 
kissing the asses of their 
superiors. Brothers. \'ou have 
been askinl( for it. Don 't think 

the~' won 't give it to ,·ou . Men 
who will not defend 
themselves. more than am' 
others. are sure to be attacked', 

Chuck Graham 

Christine Albert's comparison of the 
current "Jesus movement" with the 
drug culture (TRITON TIMES, Oct. 5) 
not only fP.Yeals her miscoDceptioo of 
what Christianity is all about, but also 
raises some legitimate questions which 
should be answered if misconceptions 
such as hers are to be dispelled -
questions which, no doubt, have 
occurred to almost everyone confronted 
with the message of Jesus. Therefore 
I'll reserve comment on Miss Albert's 
article for the final part of this 
discussion , and first attempt to answer 
the following : 11 Did this person Jesus 
really exist at all . or was he just a 
myth? 2) Exactly who was this Jesus 
Christ - just a man and perhaps a great 
teacher. or what he claimed to be (the 
Son of the living God)? 3) What is his 
message. and what sets Christianity 
apart from all other faiths? What 
accounts for the tremendous response to 
Jesus' message that is currently 
reflected in the "Jesus Movement"? 

The obvious question for those who 
declare that Jesus never existed at al\ is 
the following : what accounts. then. for 
Christianity as it is today . with over 900 
million adherents around the world? Did 
an obscure group of men band together 
and come up with a set of tea~hi!lgs they 
proceeded to spread across Judea and 
thence to the entire Roman Empire - or 
was there an original source for wha t 
they taught? Can a myth account for the 
faith of nearly one-third of humanity? I 
think not. . 

ADeleDt HistoriaDs MeDlioa Jesus 
As far as written accounts go . the life 

of Jesus is of course chronicled (in four 
different versions) in the Bible. In 
addition. at least two ancient historians 
have mentioned Jesus. Josephus 
Flavius. famed chronicler of the Jewish . 
uprising against Rome from 66-70 A.D .. 
wrote in chapter 18 of his Autiqultles 
about a man named Jesus. " .. . a wise 
man .. a doer of marvelous deeds .. . who 
led away many Jews and also manv 
Greeks. :This man was the Christ. And 
when Pilate had condemned him to the 
cross .. . those who had loved him at first 
did not cease ; for he appeared to them 
on the third day alive again." and even 
now the tribe of Christians. so named 
after him. has not vet died out." 

In recounting the conflagration of 64 
A.D. which nearlv destroyed Rome. 
Cornelius Tacitus notes ' how the 
emporor .. ero . made scapegoats of " .. . a 
class of men. loathed for their 
vices ... Chri stians. Christus. from 
whom the~' got their name. had been 
executed by sentence of the procurator 
Pontius Pilate ." 

Thus. even if one discounts the Bible. 
primary historical evidence would seem 
to indicate that Jesus did . in fact. e)(ist. 

Two Schools of Thought 
From the begInning there have been 

two schools of thought on who Jesus was 
land. to many. iS I: great teacher. but 
onlv human like the rest of us: or God in 
the' flesh. One of the first groups to 
declare Jesus onl y a man were the 
Gnostics. pseudo : intellectuals of the 
first and second centuries A.D .. who 
mix ed Christiani ty with pagan 
philosophy. In effect. they said. Jesus 
was a man deepl~' influenced by God and 
who had deep spiritual insights. but He 
was still just a man. 

Let us now consider what one Biblical

PQge" Triton Times October 19, 1971 

writer had to say about this, and. most 
importanUy. what Jesus Himsell had to 
say. John opens the first chapter of his 
gospel with the words, " In the beginning 
was the Word. and the Word was with 
God. and the Word was God. The same 
was in the beginning with God" (John 
1: 1-2). 

Notice the word " Word"- John chose 
it carefully. He was writing to both 
Greeks . and Jews. Jews would 
understand " Word " because of its Old 
Testament roots. suggesting the concept 
of the all- powerful Word of God. But in 
Greek. " Word" means " logos." For 
those trained in Greek ways of thinking. 
"logos" meant "reason" - the mind of 
God. guiding and directing the universe . 

Jell. Is God 
Verse 14 tells us who John is talking 

about: "The Word became flesh. and 
dwelt among us." He clearly says that 
the Word is Jesus Christ and that Christ 
is God Himself. 

Many theologians today see Jesus as a 
simple human being who had a knack for 
teaching through storytelling and (or 
stirring up political controversy. Did 
Jesus actually see Himself as divine . or 
was this added to Christianity by over -
enthusiastic disciples carried' away with 
religious fervor? Let's see what Jesus 
had to say. 

In John 10:30 Jesus unequivocally 
stated. " I and mv Father are one." John 
14 :9 gives His answer to Philip 's request 
to "show us the Father" : "I and my 
Father are one." Jesus also claimed 
power to forgive sins ; the Jews of his 
day fully realized that only God could do 
that I see Mark 2:5-ll!. 

When Jesus told the Jews. " Before 
Abraham was. I am." the significance 
of His words was not lost upon them. 
They knew He was claiming that He was 
from eternity. that He had lived even 
before Abraham 's time nearly 2000 
years before. . 

Coming from any mouth other than 
God·s. such statements would seem to 
symptomize sheer lunacy. But as one 
reads the Gospels one hardly gets the 
idea that Jesus was a lunatic. On the 
contrary. the impression is one of 
perfect humility. meekness and wisdom. 

Two CIJolces 
Thus one is faced with two choices 

about Jesus. In the words of C.S. Lewis 
I from Mere ChristiaDity). Jesus was 
and is the Son of God ,and that means 
God Himself. not a son of God by 
creation in the sense that all men are 
sons of God I. or He is a lunatic . " Make 
one of two choices about Jesus Christ : 
laugh at Him . spit at Him. even call Him 
the devil himself: or fall at His feet and 
call Him vour Lord and your God . But 
don 't go io Jesus with any patronizing 
nonsense about His being a great human 
teacher." This is one option the 
Scripture denies us. 

All right. then - granted that Jesus 
existed and that He was and is the Son of 
God . - That still leaves an important 
matter unresolved - why did he come. 
and whv was he crucified bv the 
procurator Pontius Pilale? How. indeed. 
could God die? 

To answer this one we have to go way 
back to the beginning when God created 
man in the first place, no. I don 't believe 
that man and ape had a common 
ancestor and evolved along separate 
paths. or that bomo babilis, homo 
erectus, ZiDjaothropus or what have you 
are man 's forbears . with all due 
apologies to Dr. Leakey I . Man was 
given one commandment - only one -

and that was to not eat of the fruit of the 
tree of the knowledge of good and evil. 
Man 's destiny was eternal life and 
eternal fellowship with God. But - and 
that's an awfully big "but" - man. 
urged on by the renegade angel Lucifer 
in the form of a serpent. broke God 's 
only commandment. 

WIly Co't It Be? 
Everyone knows the lyrics to the 

popular song by the Youngbloods 
"C'mon people. now. smile on your 
brother. everybody get together. try to 
love one another right now." etc.!. and 
it would indeed be wonderful if this 
actually did happen and all people 
everywhere did love one another . 
Needless to say. this unfortunately is not 
the case. Why? Because when God's 
only commandment was broken. an ugly 
little three-letter word-sin-entered 
upon the scene. And with it entered a 
whole panorama of things which the 
world would be better off without-hate. 
lust. envy. greed . treachery . war. and 
many other goodies which are the stuff 
of nightmares. And man. poor man. was 
condemned to live out his life upon this 
earth and. because God is holy and 
cannot-'·will not- look upon sin. doomed 
to eternal separation from his Creator. 
cannot - will not - look upon sin. 
doomed to eternal separation from his 
Creator. 

This brings us to the most crucial 
point of the entire discussion . and . 
indeed. the most wonderful. God 
provided a way out for roan. He sent His 
only Son. Jesus Christ. to die a horrible 
criminal's death on a desolate hill 
outside Jerusalem. nearly 2000 years 
ago. Why? Because, simply. He loves 
us! When Jesus died on that cross He 
paid the penalty which God. being holy. 
had to exact for sin. 

But the best is vet to come- for not 
even death could hold Jesus Christ. 
Three days after His crucifixion He rose 
again and. conquering death . walked and 
talked with his disciples for a full 40 
days before ascending to Heaven. 
I Consider the following if you doubt 
this : who moved the stone from the door 
of the tomb. and why was Jesus' body 
never found ? Could Christianity have 
survived if based on a lie? Would most of 
the disciples have suffered and 
died - many times violently - for a 
colossal hoax ? ) 

And all we have to do in order to be 
assured an eternity together with our 
Creator and our Savior is to accept the 
wonderful gift which God. in His love. 
has freely provided for us-to accept 
Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord and let 
Him pay for our sins. 

"Done !" 
This is the crucial difference between 

Christianity and all other faiths. It 
doesn't say "do ~ .. and give a long list of 
requirements for reaching heaven . In its 
marvelous simplicity it declares. 

"done ~" All we need do is believe this 
and accept God 's free gift of sa lvation 
through Jesus Christ. 

Needless tQ say. accepting Christ as 
Savior does not shield one aga inst all 
.. the mundane problems of life." to 
quote Miss Albert : indeed. Jesus and hi s 
disciples had to endure many hardships . 
Nor. as Miss Albert savs. does the mere 
intona.tion of Christ's ' name produce a 
" nice big natural high." Neither do all 
of man's cultural achievements shrink 
into absolute insignificanc Christians . 
after all . must live in the world and 
participate in its daily affairs just like 
everyone else.

Editor: 
We have discussed among 

ourselves, as most people have, 
the paucity of green upon this 
campus. We propose that the 
people of UCSD - students, 
faculty, staff - donate to the 
campus trees to be planted in 
impoverished areas of this 
school. 

Dreading red tape. we ask 
t hat whoever in the 
Administration or the ASB is in 
a position to facilitate this 
please write the TT to express 
their views. We also ask for 
feedback and improvements to 
the idea of more choropbyll per 
square meter of UCSD ground. 

The possibilities are endless : 
on your own. organize your 
suite or dorm. illicit use of 
grant moneys. enjoy a live 
Christmas tree and donate it to 
live happily ever after among 
its fellows. perhaps excess 
cafeteria funny money may be 
arranged to buy a tree. etc.

Edil«: 

At our first house meeting. I 
was told of the questionable 
parental beginnings of the 
people in tbe Mu sic 
Department. I thought it was 
just an exaggeration to test the 
gulli bility of incoming 
freshmen . but when I went 
there to ask for a key to one of 
the practice rooms. I (ound out 
everything that was said was 
true. 

The Music Department still 
believes in the theory of 
"Divine Rights." They feel 
they are the Master Race 
which will eventually control 
the University. You go in to get 
a key. and if they don 't like the 
way you look . they tell you tha t 
you have to be a music major 
or taking a music class before 
you can get a key. My 
roommate meets none of the 

It is hip time the Music 
Department realizes that it is 
part of the University, and 
must treat everyone as an 
equal. If they don ' t have 
enough keys for everyone, they 
should get more rather than 
being arbitrarily selective as to 
who gets in and who doesn't. 

Every facility in this 
University belongs to every 
student of the University in. 
theory, and its about time that 
the Music Department be 
forced to realize this. Their 
pianos are in our dorms, and if 
they don't let us in to their 
practice rooms. we might just 
find a way to keep them out of 
our dorms.

A Progress Cynic 
After glossing over the 

Friday editorial in the TRITON 
TIMES. I feel that a few 
clarifications are in order. 
Several statements were made 
in the editorial that can easily 
be grossly misinterpreted. . 

I would like to point out that 
we need $3000 for this year . If 
we receive $2000 from the com-
board. we will still need to 
raise IlOIlO. The S1.400 that will 
'be used to maintain a dark 
room and layou't room will not 
benefit us if we are not funded . 

The CRAZY TIMES is more 
than just a journal. We brought 
to the attention of students 
events of interest in our 
newspaper last year. And if the 
TRITON TIMES cannot cover 
Campus Events on a $40.000 
budget. we will try to fill the 
gap despite our more modest 
operation. Bill Maltz 

Jesus ... from pale - 4 
Instead. accepting Christ 

does at least four things for the 
believer : l! assures him of an 
eternity together with his 
Crea tor in Heaven ; 2) provides 
him with the peace of God. 
since he knows he is at last at 
peace wltll God ; 31 imparts 
him with a desire to share 
Chrisrs wonderful message 
with others ; . ) gives him an 
understanding of the Bible. 
God 's word. and a new view of 
a world made by God and 
controlled by Him as well . 

Is it any wonder. then. that 
the " Jesus Freaks " so 
enthusiastically proclaim this 
message? Christianity isn 't a 
big cop-out It's a whole new 
outlook on life. and irs an 
assurance - a blessed 
assurance - that one need go 
no further in the search for 
peace within.

Sylvia Platb'3 TIle Bell-Jar and

inner selves .. nd j!et rid of a few 
tangled lives to boot. The 
formula seems 10 he to cash in 
on the ancient 8th-grade diary 
gatherinK dust in tbe bottom of 
your closet. 

I know I sbould. in fact . make 
mention of Miss Plath 's 
grandiose gift for works and 
her way of making the 

universal malady seem very 
personal and ·· that's bow I am" 
to the reader. I sbould write 
like "The Bell-Jar is a sImple 
tale of a girl's strul!gle with 
society and witb ber own 
laqrer-tban-life demons." 
However. I don 't think an 
author capable of a book of 
poems like Ariel should be 
wasting moments of quicksand 
creativity writing the simple 
tale of a simple girl 'to the 
simple-minded folk who simply 
force the said girl to attempt 

suicide. 
I can't understand why Sylvia 

Plath bothered to rid herself of 
the past and try 10 "make 
thinj!s rillht" I her words J. 
People do write to themselves. 
they even speak to themselves. 
but these personal insij!hts 
aren ' t published . These 
insij!hts are private moments 
catching a free-for-all of 
others' lives with them. I 
believe that Svlvia Plath is 
above this ' base Rod 
McKuenism that honors the 
aIm ighty green paper bills 
above everything else . She is 

not above a public purge or 
two. 

Tbe Bell Jar concerns a 
young gir\"s emotional trials. 
The young girl. Esther. is a 
guest editor in New York 
producing a leading fashion 
magazine with 30 other young 
college women. Strangely 
enoul!h. Sylvia Plath was a

portrayed in TIle BeU Jar are 
real people - close people - in 
Sylvia's life and are 
camouflaj[ed with a flimsy 
alias in TIle BeD Jar. 

However. TIle Bell Jar was 
first publishPd in England and 
was. by Miss Plath 's request. 
to remain unpublished in the 
U.S. Sylvia Plath was vainly 
attemptinj[ an escape from old 
memories . By staring these 
memories coldly in their self-
righteous eyes and greeting 
them publicly she felt she could 
indeed escape. Yet she had not 
lost her compassion . Or 

cowardice? I like to think 
compassion would describe her 
respect for the privacy of 
others. She didn 't purj!e herself 
of worn-out lies and daily 
falsehoods at the expense of 
others. 

I only regret that it was 
necessary for Miss Plath to 
waste her short life writing The 
Bell Jar. Of course it was a 
highly interesting book as any 
True Confession or tanl/led 
soap opera can be.I enjoyed it 

• 

very mucb. I read it in one 
sitting. I loved the originill 
Sylvia Plath sketches. stuck in 
as the publisber ' s added S$$ 
punch. I suppose. But I rellret 
the lost time.For TIle Bell Jlr 

was indeed a premonition - A 
gross foreshadowinj/ . The 
ultimate in crystal gazin~ : 
" How did I know that someday 
. .. anywhere - the bell jilr 
with its stiflinj( distortations_ 
wouldn't descend again ?" 

Svlvia Plath committed 
suicide at age 31. She had 
alluded to this suicide in such 
poems !Is "Lady Lazarus" and 

.. Ariel. " A few books of poetry 
and Tbe Bell-Jar stand as 
monuments to her genius. 

The story behind this. the 
novel. and the indefinite 
number of poems that floated 
fragmented within her. never 
to be revealed. is one of the 
literary world's tragedies. And 
the simple fact that Tbe Bell-
Jar stands where these poems 
do not grants the book an ironic 
power that cannot. for all of its 
faults. be overlooked.

Saturday Cinema 
Peter Selvin the incestuous relations of two 

The Saturday evening films 
this quarter feature an 
impressive series of movies by 
Ingmar Bergman as well as 
other modern classics of 
cinema. 

The series began with 
Bergman's apocalyptic and 
moving ' 'Seventh Seal. " In the 
opening scene. a knight. newly 
returned from the Crusades. 
confronts the guise of Death in 
a game of chess : this same 
tension played throughout the 
film is finallv consummated in 
the final vfsion of universal 
death and perdition. Jean 
Cocteau 's surreal " Orpheus" 
was the second feature . 

"Through a Glass Darklv." 
Bergman's story of a you'ng 
woman 's convulsive descent 
into madness. was featured 
last week with George Bernard 
Shaw's " Major Barbara:' 

" Darkl~'" is part one of the 
Bergman trilogv that is being 
shown in this film series. 

Last weekend. part II of the 
trilog~·. " Winter Light. " 
screened at LJCSD with a 
Ha vlev :\1ills l Alan Bates 
movie: " Whistle Down the 
Wind." " Wind" is the haunting 
story of an unassuming young 
girl ..... ho th inks she has 
discovered the real Jesus. and 
thus questions her religious 
ideas. 

This coming Saturday 
evening will conclude 
Bergman's three - parter with 
the showing of "The Silence." a 
film mal deals with the 
problems of two relationships.

Virginia Woolf? " is scheduled . 
Adapted from Albee 's best -
selling play. the movie stars 
Elizabeth Taylor . Richard 
Burton. and Sandy Dennis in a 
conversation piece \ literally 
and figuratively, that marked 
this second film of director 
Mike Nichols as one of the 
finest American movies of the 
196O·s. 

November 6 will bring 
Godard 's "Le gai Savior" 
along with a short called 
"Tantra." The following week 
will bring the horrifying tale of 
a boys' preparatory school. 
.. Diabolique:' to the screen.

Intramural Statistics 
The intramural football season survived wind. rain. cold. and 

even hail as it got well into its second full week of action. Muir 
League power The Plague rolled to its second victory of the 
season by a 32-0 count over the enthusiastic. but greatly 
outmatched. Mudville Crows . The victory proved costly to the 
winners. though . as their captain Bruce Warner collided with 
his teammate Albert ILightn in') Hopkins. Warner suffering a 
broken fibula as a result. 

In coed action this week. Paul Anderson 's Wasted showed the 
talent I her name is Lynn McClure' that makes them probably 
the best coed team. although Barbara 's Teen Angels still claim 
to be the best " ball-playi ng" team around . Wasted scored " 
TD 's in each of their wins while the Teen Angels scored a keg 
in each of their losses.

Three in a Row for. Kickers 
With their 2-0 victory over 

Chapman Co llege la st 
Saturday, the Triton soccer 
team now possesses a 3-2 
record and have won their last 
three in a row. The UCSD 
offense. led by forwards Bob 
Goe. Carlos Robles. Hugo 
Flores. Fancisco Luna , Tony 
Valledolid and Ian Robertson. 
and halfbacks George Rivas 
and Andy Rubin . mounted a 
balanced attack against 
Chapman . Rivas scored the 
first goal on an indirect free 
kick. and Robles added the 
second one on a fast break. The 
momentum of the match 
seesawed constantly . with 
Chapman pu tting ' on its 
strongest thrusts in the second 
and th ird quarters . 

Triton fullbacks Ray 

Carrillo. Doug Smith. Mark 
Schneider. Stewart Hayes. Joe 
Steinberg. and goalkeeper 
Robert Van Valin cut o(f the 
Chapman offense. allowing 
only four potentially dangerous 
shots on goal during the game. 
all of which were stopped by 
the goalie. Ahead only 2-0 after 
three quarters. the Tritons 
literally blew Chapman off 
their own field in the fourth 
quarter to clinch the win . 

The "Man of the Match" 
award goes to Triton coach IIan 
Rothmuller. who ate three 
towels and chewed a wooden 
bench while guiding the Tritons 
to victory. The team travels to 
Fresno on Wednesday to play 
Fresno State. The next home 
game is next Saturday against 
Fresno Pacific College. 

Tritons Stomp Biola 
Mark Lisko 

UCSD smashed Biola in what appeared to be a cakewalk 
instead of a cross country meet. Placing the first five men. the 
Tritons ran up lo r down . since low score wins ' a 14-48 win on 
the new AAU course last Saturday at 11 a.m. 

This was the first time the Triton runners have used the AAU 
course and some excellent times were turned in . Once again 
junior Ed Avol led all runners with a pace-setting 33.37. Bob 
DeLeonardis placed second with a time of 34 .44 . followed by 
Terry King placing third with a 36.16 mark. and our favorite 
R.A .. Kirk ewell. placing fourth with a time of 37.03. 

Possibly the most exciting finish of the meet. however. was 
the finish of the fifth-placed runner. freshman Bob Perez. He 
was running neck and neck with a Biola runner until the last 30 
yards. Here he turned on a burst of speed to beat his man by 
three seconds. 37.16. and make it a clean sweep of the first 
five places by the UCSD runners. 

Coach Skief was again pleased with the performance of his 
runners. He feels that they are constantly improving and the 
team is anxiously awaIting the rest of the season. and 
especially next year. The next meet will be next Saturday at 
Balboa Park against Pasadena College. 

Bowling Balls Ride 
The Rugby Trail 

Mike Roth 
Three sports clubs of rather contrastmg natures - rugby. 

bowling. and horseback riding - are initiating membership 
drives this month and planning future activities Space does not 
allow a complete rundown of the clubs. so here are a few of the 
basics. 

Rugby. the roughest of the sports at UCSD (Or for that 
matter almost anywhere ). provides a home for the frustrated 
football hero on campus. The first club event will be held on 
Oct. 21. at 7 :30 p.m. in room 1330 of the 2-D building on the 
Muir campus. It will show films of the international match 
between ew Zealand and South Africa. and this will be 
followed by a short meeting to inform everyone of plans for the 
upcoming season . Lack of experience shouldn 't bother anyone. 
since for the first time a second team will be fielded that will 
also have a full schedule. There will be plenty of opportunity 
for everyone to play. 

The horseback riding club is in the process of lining up trail 
rides (one of which was held over the weekend ' and possibly a 
few overnight trips as activities for the upcoming vear. The 
club is open to all levels of riding experience - that mcludes 
level I . . . commonly referred to as the "what is a horse'" 
level. Two regularly - scheduled trail ride days have been set. 
the first Sunday of everv month and the third aturda\" of everv 
month. The r{de usualiy lasts for three hours and costs 7. 
which includes extensive insurance. Dues are 1 per year to be 
paid by Nov . I. and transportation to the corral IS avaIlable for 
those who need it. For information the person to call is Sandy 
Rokop at X2195. or just drop by 2233 Bonner Hall . 

Anyone interested in bo wling. whether good or bad . is invited 
to join the UCSD Bowling Club. The club provides instructlon 
in the sport from a certified instructor . participation In a 
bowling league. and intercollegiate bowling. If interested call 
453-8565. or contact the Physical Education Office in the gym 
for further information.
