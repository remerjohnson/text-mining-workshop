Volume 14, Number 14 
A series of changes has been 

proposed by state auditors for 
University of California 
operations . according to 
yesterday's LOS ANGELES 
TIMES. These changes include 
a sharp increase in faculty 
teaching load. an increase in 
student fees to pay for building 
maintenance. and a drastic 
reduction in new book 
purchases. 

These recommendations are 
contained in a series of 37 
separate reports compiled by a 
State Department of Finance 
audit team which has been 
visiting UC campuses in recent 
months. 

According to the auditors. 
these changes would save the 
state about $70 million a year. 
but UC officials say they would 
cripple the University. 

Last week a furor developed 
over one of the auditor 's 
suggestions: that UC sell some 
of its rare book collections to 
provide extra revenue in the 
present tight budget period. 

'_'Very Preliminary 

Director of Finance. Verne 
Orr said the proposal to sell the 
rare books and other audit 
recommendations were "very 
preliminary" suggestions 
which may never become 
Reagan Administration policy. 
But UC officials are taking at 
least some of the audit 
proposals seriously. 

There have been so reports 
made public. but from sources 
within the University and 
elsewhere it has been learned 
that the auditors made these 
major recommendations. 

1) UC faculty members 
should devote an average of 
nine hours each week to 
classroom or laboratory 
teaching. instead of the five or 
six hours the auditors say they 
teach now. .. 

2) Only UC Berkeley and 
UCLA should have major 
research libraries and scholars 
at the other six UC general 
campuses should depend on 
interlibrarv loans or bus 
shuttle service for their needs. 
This would save between $.1.35 
million and $8 .15 million 
annually. according to the 
auditors. 

3) Student fees should be 
increased about $40 per year. 
with the money used to 
maintain campus buildings and 
to pay for such student services 
as counseling and health care. 
UC students" fees have been 
risinlC steadily in recent years 
and now range from $621 to $678 
per year on the nine campuses. 

Government Support 
Propo ed 

4) The federal government 
and other agencies spon oring 
UC research should be required 
to pay part of the salari s of 
the profe ors who do the work . 

5) The niversitv should turn 
over to the State GeneralFund 
all of the "overhead" money it 
receive . for administered 
federal contracts and grants. 
Under present arrangements 
the niversit\' divide this 

mone~' equa ll~: with th tate. 
La t "ear it amount d to about 
$30 million. 

6l The llniver itv of alifor-
nia Pr ss. which publishe 
cholarl\' books mo s t 

commercial publi hers would 
not handle. hould break even 
on it operation in tead of 
receiving a subsidy from th 
tate. 
7) The " indirect co t " of 

running Universit~· Exten ion 
and ummer Se ion course -
admini trative salarie and th 
cost of using building - hould 
be paid by the niversit~· 
instead of the state. 

- . -Iton tl 
8) State subsidies to UC 

teaching hospitals should be 
halted and the UniVersity no 
longer should use student fees 
income to supplement salaries 
of medical school professors. 

9, The Ciuthority of UC 
President Charles J . Hitch and 
his staff should be increased 
and UC operations should be 
more standarized. with less 
diversity permitted on the nine 
campuses. 

Hitch has declined to 
comment on the audit 
proposals. on the grounds they 
are not yet final recommenda-
tions. He has also ordered 

University of California, San Diego 
recommendations may be 
eliminated in the audit division 
and we may eliminate some 
more here in my office on a 
policy basis." the finance 
director stated. 

Only the "most feasible " 
proposals will be turned into 
final recommendations. Orr 
said. and even they "can only 
be made as sUlCgestions. not 
edicts - our onlv control over 
the University ' is the total 
number of dollars we put into 
their budget. " 

However. UC officials noted 
that control over the total 
appropriation is a formidable 

average of nine hours per 
week. This recommendation 
apparently is based on what 
Orr called a "cursory look" at 
four academic departments on 
all eight UC general campuses. 
This check is said to have 
produced evidence that in some 
departments on some 
campuses professors spend as 
little as three of four hours in 
classroom or lab contact with 
students. 

UC sources said the auditors. 
in checking faculty workload. 
counted only hours spent in the 
classroom or laboratory. and 
gave no credits for the many

personal prestige and higher 
salary. "There are strong 
indications that they have a 
personal interest in maximum 
acceleration of collection 
growth," the report states. 

"First of all. there may be 
considerations of professional 
status. Within the library 
community. collections are 
evaluated' on the basis of size 
and the possession of materials 
of relative scarceness". There 
is also a salary incentive to 
make one's collection as large 
as possible. " 

Empire-Building" 
Denied 

doing research under contract 
or grants paid for by outsiders 
should receive a portion of 
their salaries from these non-
University sources. 

In rebu·ttal. officials pointed 
out that research is required of 
all UC professors: it is part of 
the job for which they are paid. 

They also noted that the 
federal government. the main 
source of research funds. 
requires the University to put 
up matching money in order to 
obtain contracts and grants. 
Usually this matching money 
takes the form of faculty time. 

State auditors suggest that U( 
The recommendation that 

student fees should be used to 
pay for building maintenance 
apparently is based on the 
belief that. since student fees 
already are being used to build 
new academic facilities. they 
should also be used to mainta'in 
them.

p:age two 
JQsh McDowell to speak 
on Christian ethics here 

Josh McDowell. 32-year-old scholar. who in the past five 
years has spoken on more than 400 campuses in 38 countries. 
gave a series of lectures last weekend in the San Diego area. 
Over 200 college students heard these lectures on Christian 
apolegetics. consisting of the discussion of nine points which 
Josh feels must be explained away before a person can 
intellectually and realistically reject Christianity. 

Along these lines. Josh spoke of what he had found in his 
studies on the reliability of the Scriptures. the uniqueness of 
the person and claims of Jesus Christ. the conversion of Saul of 
Tarsus. the Jew. prophecy fulfilled in the life of Jesus and 
prophecy being fulfilled today. 

According to Josh. "The majority of student movements are 
in error today because they are based on a thesis that history 
has proved to be false . A change in the social and economic 
system of society is not enough to bring about peace. Envy. 
greed. racism and hatred will still be present in the nature of 
man. What we need is a power that can change man 's basic 
nature. " 

It is Josh 's conviction that the one Person capable of 
effecting this inner change is Jesus Christ -"the only true 
source of lasting solution to man's problems." 

Josh will be giving a variety of lectures this week at San 
Diego State College. They are : Wednesday. 8 p.m. in the Casa 
Real Room of Aztec Center. on " History-Revolution-
Resurrection :" Thursday. 8 p.m. in SS-I00 on " Prophecy : Will 
the J\ext World War be the Last :" and Friday. 7 p.m" SS-I00. 
"Maximum Sex." 

During the hazy hours of the 
morning, in a dinj{y motel room 
in Toledo, RADIO KRAP was 
born. without anesthetic. Its 
immaculate conception 
occurred wben Peter Kizinski 
rewired a small Wollensak tape 
recorder. A few experimental 
tapes later and a electrical 
connection into a stereo 
system. KRAP thrust its way 
into the hearts and homes of 
the Revelle student body. 

Radio KRAP is a non-profit, 
non -secta r ia n, non -
commerical. non-sensical 
enterprise. Its inner sanctum is 
composed of "Engineer Hank" 
(boss DJ . head writer and 
former cut-man for Floyd 
Patterson): "Uncle" Paul 
Kutuskii (the Kiddies ' pal and 
former Encino bus driver) : 
and Peter Kizinski (bon vivant.

is complemented by Edtorial 
Assistant Lynn Ubu. indulgent 
philanthropist D.R. Bilgewater

president and general 
manager. Elton P. Warthog. 
KRAP has been broadcasting 

Coming tomorrow 

Radio KRAP smells bad 

(more or less sporadically) 
programs of tasteless comedy 
and social commentary. 

Though originally established 
on the 5th floor of Argo Hall . 
KRAP had to be moved due to 
threats of violence against the 
staf£. their immediate 
families . and their personal 

property. KRAP presently 
resides somewhere in Galathea 
(names and room numbers 
~ave been withheld to protect 
. the disturbed ). 

Broadcasting on weekends. 
RADIO KRAP has a progaga-
lion radius of three furlongS 
with the wind, and is powered 

I J 

by two Everyready flashlight 
batteries and a lot of chutzpah. 

A preview of the forthcoming 
show includes this following 
commerical message. Elise : 
"Look Joe. I've gollen rid of 
my frizzies! " Joe : "Yes Elise. 
but you still limp." So stay 
tuned and ... PEACE! 

In addition. Josh will be on Revelle Plaza at noon tomorrow 
to talk on hypocrisy in the church.

The San Diego Blood Bank's 
Bloodmobile will be on the 
UCSD campus from 11 a .m. to 3 
p.m. on. Wednesday ·ov. 17. in 
front of the Lower Blake 
Lounge. 

The San Diego Blood Bank 
provides more than 30.000 pints 
of blood everv ,'ear for the 
people of San' Diego County. 
Over 30 hospitals in the county 
draw from the blood collected 
by the San Diego Blood Bank. 

The San Diego Blood Bank is 
a non-profit organization which 
only charges a service fee to 
pay I'or the costs of drawing. 
processing and delivering 
blood. It was organized in 1950 
with the cooperation of the San 
Diego County Medical Society 
and the cit v and count. of San 
Diego. Since that time. more 
than 400 .000 units of blood have 
been used in emergency 
surgery in childbirth. in open 
heart surgery. and in many 
other cases requiring blood to 
save lives. 

No substitute has been found 
for human blood : therefore the 
complete suppl~' must come 
from donors. A 24-hour supply 
of all types ot blood must 
constant I\' be available. but 
blood can be preserved for only 
21 days Therefore. blood must 
be dona ted a nd collected 
throughout the entire year. 

The blood bank has 
established group reserve 
accounts which in man\' ways 
work like a joint checking 
accounts in banking. UCSD has 
such a group accoun t from 
which students. stat r. and 
faculty may draw upon if the 
need arises. In order to keep 
the balance at a level which is 
useful. blood drives such as the 
one this Wednesda\' are 
or!!anized . A donation of blood 
is not on'" a wi se investment 
for \'ou rs'el I' but for all the 
members of the campus

'Elitism and Admissions 
by Bruce Condra 

As the head of this article suggests, the symptoms of distaste 
for college life (which we see manifest in evervone's behavior 
to some degree) are in part an attempt ' to answer an 
unqualified charge that sludents are re,ponsible for the 
inequities that exist in college admission 
procedures".procedures which students have no power to 
adjust. 

A most potent result of attending UC can be the conclusion 
that a college education is an unmerited badge of white elitism. 
Junior faculty members /themselves a true elite) sometimes 
try to cultivate this attitude in order to help themselves. 
reasoning that students who take their studies seriously pose a 
personal job - security hazard. _ 

Egged on from all corners. students fall into mutual 
backbiting to expiate their new - found guiltiness. Each white 
occupies a seat which might otherwise be available to Blacks 
of Chicanos or to any other minority of America-speak they 
non-standard English or whatever they choose. I firmly 
suggest that college admission procedures be altered to admit 
anyo."e who has .the desire to attend. Remove the degree -
credit - grade system. and substitute examinations of 
proficiency in various vocational areas".optional to any 
student. Make college and high school year-round operations. 
with relaxed attendance schedules. This having been done. 
invite 1000 Australian Aborigines. 2000 citizens of Indonesia 
and 3000 Chinese fro'm the mainland. Distribute them 
throughout the high schools and colleges. Let these people 
provide courses in their language and culture. 

Once a person ceases to think of himself as an agent of 
elitism. college can be seen for what it is - an opportunity. 
Students who have been programmed into college with 
essentially no say in the matter - high school students - are 
open to the suggestion that college is only useful in that it 
might serve as a t ieket to a secure job in a large impersonal 
organization. or as a key to a professional school. In this sense. 
college education is much akin to membership in a trade union. 
Guessing. hoping that the union will fold and the degree 
become useless. the four years might appear to be wasted 
investment. 

But it is only after a student has taken time to try other 
futures that (s )he comes to a reahzation that college is not just 
a work permit. A person is indeed fortunate if IS the arrives at 
this conclusion while still financially able to attend. To these 
people. it is likely that the experience of college will be less full 
of overreaction to charges of elitism and somewhat more 
pointed in its goals. 

For be it elitist or no - it's still what a person makes it to be.

San Diego A ortion 
Action Coalition 

by Kathy E ty 
Because of the restrictive Abortion Action Coalition 

abortion laws in the United (S DAAC J supports this 
States today. over 1.000 women demonstration. We want to 
are forced to criminal include local women bv 
abortionists each year and sponsoring a bus to San 
because of this. at least four Francisc(r."' Ticket3 available 
women die every day from ($15 round trip ) from Kathy 
abortions. The total deaths per Esty in Visual Arts Dept. 
year amounts to more than 
i5.000 women every year with 
the poor and the non - white 
women comprising most of this 
total. 

On July 16. 17 and 18 of this 
year . more than 1.000 women 
met in New York City to launch 
the Women 's National Abortion 
Action Coalition in order to 
coordinate the nationwide fight 
for the repeal of all abortion 
laws. Three of the demands 
made at this conference by the 
Women 's National Abortion 
Action Coalition were : 1) 

There are many arguments 
against abortion. One is: 

. Abortion is a dangerous 
medical procedure. This is 
very untrue if it is performed 
within 12 weeks. A vacuum 
aspirator abortion performed 
during the first 12 weeks of 
pregnancy can be done safely 
and quickly in any properly

The Price of Silence 
byJim ill 

Some people say that abortion is " one of those issues :" one 
impossible to debate without acrimonious comments and 
rasied voices. It is a controversy u uaUv discussed only in the 
uncompromising language of moral absOlutes. . 

Those people are. by and large. right : and I should know. 
having gollen into this touchy issue before. Let me try DOW to 
calmly and succintly explore the issue. Let's clearly 
summarize the points of philosophical. political and medical 
contention that separate those who favor . and those who 
oppose. abortion. 

Perhaps the fundamental disagreement centers around the 
qut:stion : When does " life" begin? Is the destruction of a 12-
week-old fetus murder? Or is it the humane elimination of a 
portion of the mother's body? 

The proponents of abortion (henceforth referred to as the 
"pros") begin by noting that a fetus is totally dependent on its 
mother. The opponents (henceforth referred to as the "cons") 
reply that a new-born child is no less dependent on its mother 
for food and shelter. The pros note that a three month fetus is 
tiny. six inches in length. and that the sensibility and 
intelligence which make a man individual cannot be present in 
the fetus . 

The cons rejoinder is that the fetus at this stage has most of 
its vital organs : the heart is beating. the brain and nervous 
system are highly developed. the fingers and toes can be 
counted and the face has a distinctlv human cast. Brainwaves 
have been det~ted as early as eight weeks. The child is 
generally sucking his thumb by age 12 weeks. Genetically. the 
cons contend. the exchange of genetic information at 
conception produces a genetically unique being which will 
never be duplicated. The development of personality. they add_ 
is a gradual process. certainly not completed for several years 
after birth. 

Abortions may legally be performed in California up to the 
20th week . in New York until the 24th week . 

The political aspects of abortion are if possible even more 
confusing. Both sides of the controversy claim to be the side of 
individual freedom and society 's best interest. The pros 
contend that a woman should have the right to dispose. as she 
wishes of her own body. They say that laws against abortion 
are an unnecessary intrusion into American privacy. and as 
such are a standing threat to civil liberties. The cons reiterate 
that a fetus is not part of a woman 's body. but rather 
independent life. and thus entitled to full protection from 
society. They hold that legalization and public funding of 
abortion establishes the principle that certain citizens are 
expendable in the interests of society . The pros place much 
reliance on the pop~lation problem. noting that abortion is an 
invaluable aid in population control. The cons reply that men 
have never solved their problems through destruction. that the 
problem cannot be solved by destroying the problem child. 

Abortion is no easy question to resolve. It is the view of this 
writer that it is impossible to clearly decide whether a felu . at 
any particular stage. is alive or not alive. Yet. even this 
tenuous conclusion is enough to make me an opponent of 
abortion. If we are willing to give the " benefit of the doubt" to 
accused murderers. can we do any less for an innocent unborn 
child? .

Flag Football 
Reaches Climax 

Pat Stacy 
As college football 

throughout America draws to a 
close. each game becomes 
more and more crucial. While 
Auburn and Georgia were busy 
battling it out for the Southeast 
Conference championship and 
a Sugar Bowl bid. intramural 
football at UCSD proceeded 
towards a climactic finish. 
With just a few regular season 
games remaining the playoff 
situation is shaping up with a 
few surprises. a few not-so-sur-
prises. and a"we're not-really-
sure-what·s·going·to--happen: 
yet. " 

The biggest upset occurred in 
Revelle League in probably the 
hardest-hitting game or' the 
year. the end result of which 
was a 6·0 squeaker for the Orcs 
over favorite Argo II. Both 
teams were super·fired for the 
game. the Orcs fighting a life· 
and-death struggle for a tie for 
the Revelle Leal!ue leadership . 
As an unfortunate consequence 
there were many costly 
roughness penalties due to 
over-zealous play by both sides. 
The Orcs ' Damon Dalistratv 
again showed why he is one of 
the most exciting runners in 
intramural football. ripping off 
long gains and finally tallying 
the game 's only TD. receiving 
a hall back- option pass from 
Don Reordan. 

Reordan and Wally 
McCloskey. both freshmen . had 
excellent J.lames both 
offensively and defensivelv. 
both blocking superbly arid 
McCloskey sacrificing his body 
to clog up the powerfu I Argo II 
sweeps. Doug Beanan plaved a 
strong J.lame for the losers. 
making some unbelievable 
punts. to leave the Orcs in a 
hole for much of the game. The 

Orcs' victory threw the Revelle 
League into a 3·way tie for first 
(Argo V is also 5·1 J. The Orcs 
drew the bye for the playoff for 
the league championship. 

Bran X clinched the Revelle 
X League championship. but 
not before the Snoids put up a 
hell·of·a struggle. holding the 
X·men to a 6-6 tie. An inspired 
Snoid defellse effectively 
bottled up the talented Bran X 
runners. and performed a 

mi~or miracle in holding the 
champs 3 downs ' Crom the 
Snoid 's own 2-yard line. 

De Anza arid the Stumblers 
clinched t~eir respective titles 
(Muir and Open I by knocking 
off the Mudhens and the Men. 
De Anza finally had its shutout 
strinj! snuffed out in their 19-6 
victory. Rick Coleman. who 
gets my vote lor MVP of 
intramurals. played another 
amazing J.lame offensivelv and 
defensivelv. . 

And as 'for cocd ", the Bares 
goosed the fun· loving Goosers 
21-6 In a game played well into 
dark . The Geese. who somehow 
struggled to a 5·2 record behind 
the play of the talented 
Debbie 's (Sheppard and 
Vacarriello I and a tremendous 
amount of finesse (also known 
as " faking it " l. baffled 
everyone on their touchdown 
play. It was so dark that vou 
could barely see the ball when 
center Eric' faked a snap. stuck 
the ball under his shirt and 
"sped " over the J.loal line. 

either the Bares nor the 
bewildered Zebras had any idea 
what was coming off. Having 
no other choice . the Zebes 
signalled " touchdown " and the 
Goosers were on the board . The 
Bares pla~' Circulatory System

UCSD Basketball 
Hope to Out-think 0 

Ma rk Young 

In this al(e of - of - whatever this age is of -
we have a group of short· haired activists who 
have dedicated themselves to the proposition that 
a ball is round and should be thrown through a 
hoop. If you 're now thinking what I think vou're 
thinking. forget it : I'm talking about this year's 
basketball team . Guided by the experienced eye 
of coach Barry Cunningham. this year's edition of 
the Triton basketball team will exhibit a 
combination of peed. aggression . and brains. 
That is to say. they are lacking on the boards and 
must make up it in other ways. Coach 
Cunningham feels that a strong and tenacious 
man - to - man defense with a patient and passing 
offense could lead to a successful season for the 
Tritons. 

The Triton have been working on a number of 
drills in practice to assure the quickness and 
rugged play which they must exhibit in the games 
to come. Cu nningham seems to be instilling a 
sense of motion where the ball players must 
anticipate the moves and reactions of their 
teammates. This is an all-important facet of the 
passing offense which the Tritons will be running 
this year. 

With the sense of apathy spreading over this 
campu . it is encouraging to see a group of men 
I short·haired. yet i j!iving their time freely to the 
achievement of some sort of self-excellence. 
Sinc ba ketball players don't j!et any 
scholar hips. there are no dumb jocks here. 
Each pla~' er must meet the high level of 
acad mic achievement et bl' this institution of 
higher learning - without the help of an affluent 
PE Department. Plavers must make it both on 
and off the court. This is wh:> Coach Cunningham 
feels so pleased with the athletes he coaches. He 
feels the~' are a fine group of young men who are 
displaying a fine attitude and a great desire. 
When watching-a practice it's often hard to tell 
what the players think under the the sweat. But 
the mere fac t that they are there shows the 
dedication that the\' have to the fame of 
basketball. . 

The loss of Mark Wilson. Brian Todd. and Steve 
Hoch leaves the Tritons on the short end of an 
experienced front line. To make up for this 10 s. 
Cunningham looks to Scott Wril(ht and Dave 
Wriji!ht. veterans from last vear. and Paul 
Trainer and Pete Henderson. new recruits. The 
Wriji!ht bo~'s Inot spelled R-I-G-H-TI both plaved 
quite a bit for last ~'ear ' s Tritons and should give 
the team some experience under the boards. 
Dave is the super-hustler of the team and is 
constantl~' puttinl! out that little extra effort. You 
might remember him from last I'ear's All-Cal 
Tournament. '.I·hen he put on dribbiing exhibition 
to ril'al that of Curl~' :\'eal hi mscH. ScOll is the 
ganJ.llinji! blonde who seems to be in danger of 
cracking his head on the rim ever~' time he leaps 
for rebound. CunninlZham sees the 6'7" Trainer as 
ha\'ing the potenlial to be the oest freshman to 
e\'er pial' at L'CSD. He is tall .. nd 3j!i1e With a good 

" 

sense of the bu(~ke~~sit.ion is warned not to

The cross couQtl')\ team is in the midst of a crucial and busy 
three weeks. and U1~ tesults of the first two weeks are here and 
waiting to be printed. In order to clarify things. Saturday. 11-6-
71. there was \he Biola Invitational at Biola : last Sa'turday 

th~re w~s the N~IA Di trict III Championships: and. to top ail 
thIS exclttng actiOlL next week. get this. the ALL-CAL meet 
will occur. I 

The first big'meet was the Biola Invitational. There were 64 
runn~rs from .11. schools participating. and this precipitated 
multiple traffiC Jams on the c.0~rse . Runnin~ and placing for 
UCSD was Bob DeLeonardiS. lID1shtng 16th With a time of 26,29 
and receiving a me~al for his efforts . Jerry King. who recorded 
a. tlme of 26 :56. finished 22nd and Bob Perez placed 32nd with a 
time of 27 : 51 . Also running in the race Bob HolzinlZer . Chuck 
Crumly and H~well Usher. providing some depth for UCSD. 
Ftnally. Kirk Newell started for UCSD and was running quite 
well : however. poor Kirk took a wrong turn in the midst of the 
course and It took three days to find him again. 

The next big meet was last Saturdav and the famed AlA 
District ~I/ C~ampionships (UCSD. forthose of you who didn't 
know. IS 10 District III In almost all sports I I. This was another 
grandiose meet. with 13 schools competing and probablv 
somewhere around 80 runners I this makes it necessary to have 
stop- lights on the course I. There was a lot of competition in the 
meet. however. and UCSD didn 't do all that bad (not all that 
good. either for that malten The first three finishers were 
OccidentaL 44 points : .USIU. 48 points: and Westmont. third 
With 116 pomts. UCSD followed these teams. placing 9th with a 
score of 199 points. 

Individually. once again the Tritons were led bv Bob 
DeLeonardis. He placed 27th with a time of 26 :43. He was 
closely followed by Jerry King. placing 33rd with a 26 :59 : and 
Kirk .. ewe.lI. who was able. to stav on the course and not get 
lost. .flnlshtng 41st with a lime of 27 :30. Again all the Triton 
harriers ran the race : however. Ed Avol. who was the premier 
runner at the beglnntnl! of the season. couldn 't finish the race. 

The last big event in this trilogy of star-studded races is the 
ALL-CAL championships. This year the meet will be held here 
at UCSD. The teams competing will include. among others. UC 
Irvine. UC Riverside. UC Davis and probablv UC Berkeley. 
along with home team UCSD. The meet will be held th'is 
Saturday on the CSD cross country course. The course is 
loc.ated on the end of Matthews Campus by Miramar road . 
ThiS IS the last meet 01 the season and it shou Id be quite 
exciting. 

Cal Tech Drowned 
at Hands of UCSD 

The sea on for the water polo 
team. as undoubtedly the great 
majority of you realize. is 
rapidly drawing to a 
co nclusion . Saturdav the 
Tritons traveled to Cal Tech 
and demonstrated what is 
perhaps the team ' most 
grandiose example of letharj!y. 
The lack of team unitv for this 
game was evident from the 
start. as evervbody left in 
different cars ' at ' different 
times under the casua l 
assumption that everyone 
would run into each other at the 
right time and right place in 
Pasadena. 

Fortunately . that did happen . 
out the casual approach to the 
game persisted. The team 
warmed up lazily. waiting lor 
the infamous Cal Tech refs to 
show up . Combined with Cal 
Tech 's pool. the refs have 
,created a legend at Cal Tech 
for slighth' slanted officiating. 
The refs turned out to favor 
only ignorance and the shallow 
end. The shallow end is so 
shallow that Rick Parmer. the 
goalie didn 't even get hi s sweat 
pants wet while warming up . 
Correspondingly the goal is. 
they say in water polo circles. a 
"!!arage door ." Fortunately for 

High Tide 

the Tritons. Rick spent many 
childhood days in the garage. 
so he had it pretty well 
covered . 

So the local gang just wasn 't 
up for this one. in spite of a 
surprising number of UCSD 
fans. including representatives 
from the Stanford and Berkeley 
chapters of the UCSDWPFC ·. 
Margaret. president of the 
Stanford chapter. flew down 
Friday. but got her landing 
gear screwed up and ended up 
on crutc:les. 

The distraction was enough 
to find the Tritons only winning 
by one III goal at halftime. lOr 
was it 2' I Anyway. it was 
close. ridiculou Iv close. to 
say the least. Stoner kept 
coming to the sidelines at time 
out saying "come on you guvs. 
get serious." which everyone 
was sincerely trying to do but 
just couldn ·t. How can anyone 
get serious when the passing 
and shooting are pathetic 
enough to be laughed at? 
Perhaps the only guy who 
looked good was defensive 
strong boy John Hoff. He really 
wasn 't doing that much more. 
but must have gotten more 
sleep. since just sittinj( there

One picks up this book about 
a week in the life of a political 
celebrity expecting to be 
dazzled ' by the spectacular 
sights of life at the top : the 
personalities. the glory. the 
ambience of life lived at its 
fullest. And it is all there. The 
debates with Ramsev Clark 
and Dick Gregory. ttie criss-
crossing of the country. the 
emotional acclaim or 
disapproval of college 
audiences. Yet the sense of 
fatigue is also there . and one 
realized that the Cruising 
Speed of William Buckley's life 
is a soul-draining one. It is the 
life of the American politician ; 
Buckley 's point on the political 
spectrum being merely a detail , 
in the panorama of America. 

several hours. most of them 
filled with angry and emotional 
debate. And there are the 
letters, 500 a week . which come 
to Buckley in endless variety. 
and which he (usually) 
manages to answer 
personally ...

repelled by him. With a 
desperate energy they ask the 
most demagogic and unfair 
questions for bours on end in

Perhaps the part of the boIi 
most characteristic of 
Buckley's usual style is hi!

about his election as editor of

Perhaps the most striking 
feature of this book to the 
reviewer is its stvle. Bucklev's 
columns. as weli as his otlier 
published works. are tightly 
reasoned and concise. This 
book wanders in and out of 
subject matter. even as his 
days wander from place to 
place and job to job. It is as 
though Buckley wished to tell 
us of the kind of strain under 
which the celebrity operates. 
Even so. one has few glimpses 
of Buckley's personal life. His 
wife. Pat. remains a shadow. 
his son is never mentioned . his 
siblings briefly referred to. 

Buckley has captured the 
endless round of work that 
politics becomes for the full· 
time publicist : as the reviewer 
knows on Iv too well. And 
what end does Buckley

MASH -JW 
I have been chided for writing 

reviews long after the movie being 
reviewed was fresh in the reader 's 
mind. So. this commentary (which is 
not a review) is directed to'the number 
of you who saw "MASH" recentlv at 
UC'SD or have seen it someplace else. 
and remember it. fond Iv or otherwise. 

When "MASH" first 'appeared there 
were two critical viewpoints balled 
around by the people who enjoyed the 
film (and many apparently did l. One 
group thought it was a serious. 
trenchant satire on war. satiric 
because it was funnv and horribly 
realistic at the same' time (all that 
spurting blood. all those pitiful bodies. 
shattered shells of men). something 
like Dr . Strangelove . The second group 
of cfitics no which I first belonged ) 
thought it was a lightly funny comedy. 
the Korean War being a remote enough 
backdrop to show the antics of Our 
Boys cutting up the army. like the ma n 
at the end of the movie said. Good 
performances. a sympathetic puppy as 
lot of laughs in a-slam-bang football 
game. etc. but not a serious anti -war 
movie at all just good dirty fun . 

I saw the movie again and still 
thought it was funny and not 
particularly serious. But I was 
disturbed bv an undercurrent of 

something very dangerous -
dangerous because it was hidden to 
those who did not already have the 
consciousness (or whatever it takes) to 
recognizE.' it: the film 's rotten atti tude 
towards women. 

Certainly the whole doctor-nurse 
relationship. a key area of the film. is a 
sick one. if onlv because most doctors 
are men - top bananas - and most 
nurses are women. Any exceptions to 
that rule are considered strange. even 
now. But since "MASH" was supposed 
to have taken place in the ·5O·s. could 
you expect a liberated system. with 
men and women working equally 
together? No. of course not ; not if 
"MASH" is a bit of realism a slice of 
life . But look at the presuppositions 
about women the film reinforces. 
without you obviously knowing it : . 

First . that women talk about or think 
about nothing important (note the first 
scene with the nurses at the men's 
table ) and are to be cutely and quickly 
propositioned. but in that straight 
forward. winning way they ultimately 
ca n't turn down . 

Second . that any women with 
" intelligence" (the movie does equate 
rank with intelligence. in spite of 
appearances) is quite mad. and must 
be brought down to the level of idiocy 
where she is most natural. This is the 
meaning of the metamorphosis of Head 
Nurse Hoolihan in to Hot Lips Hoolihan 

(Hot Lips at the football game : "They 
sbot him. they .. : ' to which Head Man 
replies something like " It's just the 
end of the question, you stupid broad" 
- a funny line, no?) . Ah . the lovely 
difference between the early Nurse H. 
and later Bonnie Hot Lips (of " Bonnie 
and Clyde" ) watching her Man play 
poker with a lacquered poker chippie I 

Third . that all any women really 
needs is to be well-fucked - that post-
coital smile in the helicopter was 
funny. but you believed it because it's 
time. Not so? Isn 't that how Scarlett 
O' Hara (Hot Lips O'Hara?) got it from 
Rhett Butler in "Gone With tbe 
Wind"? Remember her smile? But 
she must have been a bitch 'cause it 
didn 't keep her smiling. And how did 
the dentist in .. MASH : ' the "best· 
equipped dentist in the Army. " behave 
just after his resurrection? 'As normal 
and unaffected as apple pie. Women 
are normal when they are sexually 
anesthetized ' into smiling morons 
(which men can do - what power!). 
but men are normal when they can act 
cooi and do their competent high,level 
intelligent work getting pleasure out of 
it, and out of everything else on the 
side. I'm not saying that sexual 
intercourse shouldn 't result in such 
smiles - it can and does . for both 
women and men . But the idea that a 
woman should trip along happily doing

by Father

In May, 1968, nine people, 
including a former nun and two priests, 

burned 378 draft files to protest 
Vietnam. Was it an act of conscience? 

Civil disobed ience? A crime? 
Christian duty? With unsurpassed moral 

intensity, this chllllenging new drama 
eXllmines the backgrounds of the nine; 

re-enacts the burning and presents 
excerpts from the tense trial.
