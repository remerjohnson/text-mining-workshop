The A.S. Office of External Affairs held a rally yester-day on Library Walk, part 
of a campaign aimed at protecting 
the future of Cal Grants with a 
state constitutional amendment.

The campaign, which began 
at a UC Students Association 
board meeting last month, hopes 
to convince Sen. Denise Ducheny 
(D-Chula Vista) to draft an amend-
ment that would save the Cal 
Grants from future funding cuts.

In May, Governor 
Schwarzenegger  proposed to 
eliminate the Cal Grant program 
completely, inciting protests 
across all 10 UC campuses.

“Luckily, the legislature put 
the money back and gave a lot 
of students who rely on the Cal 
Grant renewed hope for being 
able to attend their university,” 
Celina Velazquez, Legislative 
Liaison for the A.S. Office of 
External Affairs, said.

The event is part of a state-
wide campaign organized by the 

REGISTRATION 
FEES PULLED 
FROM STUDENT 
SERVICES
By Ayelet Bitton
Staff Writer   

Over $1 million in student reg-
istration fees have been reallocated 
from student services to compensate 
a campus funding shortfall of $84.2 
million. An additional $2.5 million 
has been set aside in anticipation of 
future funding cuts.

Each UCSD student currently 
pays $900 in annual registration fees 
— funds intended for a variety of 
student service programs, ranging 
from counseling and psychological 
services to the Career Services Center 
and campus sports facilities. 

However, due to cutbacks in 
state funding, the Office of the Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs is now 

channeling $1,316,672 
— or 8 percent of the 
$19 million total reg-
istration-fee budget 
— toward other areas 
such as the Registrar’s 
Office, the Office of 

Admissions, classroom maintenence, 
staff salaries and equipment.

Last year, the Registration Fee 
Advisory Committee released a 
report recommending where regis-
tration fees should be reallocated.

“[In] normal years we go through 
and we decide what we want to allo-
cate for new programs and initia-
tives, but this past year was essen-
tially a unique one,” former commit-
tee chair and graduate student Garo 
Bournoutian said.

Since July, the Vice Chancellor 
departments have reduced their 
operating budgets to remedy the 
$84.2 million budget cuts. The chang-
es amount to roughly $20 million in 
cuts, while the newly implemented 
faculty furlough plan will save an 
additional $75 million. 

The remaining gap of about 
$40 million was filled by a loan 
from internal funds, Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Ed 
Spriggs said.

The Office of the Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs determined the 
final registration-fee budget and allo-
cations, using the committee’s report 
as a guide. 

“Because we’re trying to protect 
the academic mission, all of the 
vice-chancellor offices contributed,” 
Spriggs said. “The reg. fee commit-

SAVE THE
GRANTS
Top: Roughly 15 students 
gathered in front of Geisel 
Library Oct. 29 to promote 
a constitutional 
amendment that would 
make Cal Grants a 
mandatory part of the state 
budget. Student speakers 
shared personal ﬁnancial 
struggles and advocated 
to save a program that 
provided $967 million in 
ﬁnancial aid this year.

Berkeley Leads Conference on Higher Education

By Jake Blanc
Senior Staff Writer

In reaction to recent budget cuts, 
over 800 people filled the Pauley 
Auditorium at UC Berkeley on Oct. 
24 in an effort to coordinate statewide 
action in defense of public educa-

tion. The conference was attended 
by students, faculty and community 
members from UC campuses, state 
universities, community colleges, 
K-12 education and labor unions. 

The conference resulted in the 
decision to call a statewide strike and 
day of action on March 4 to build a 
unified movement of all educational 
sectors in the state. 

“I was really happy with how 
the conference turned out,” Desiree 
Angelo, a student organizer from the 

City College of San Francisco, said. 
“We had really less than a month 
to organize it, and we got over 800 
people from across the state — from 
across public education — together in 
one room.” 

Along with voting on the March 4 
strike, the conference called for state-
wide action from Nov. 17 to Nov. 19 
to coincide with a meeting of the UC 
Board of Regents in Los Angeles. The 
labor unions in attendance endorsed 
both proposals, which called for soli-

darity to support the student move-
ment.

“There was overwhelming sup-
port for solidarity action [on Nov. 
17] and overwhelming support for 
the March 4 strike,” Angelo said. “All 
different sectors of public education 
voted to endorse solidarity action.”

Participants also discussed pro-
posals ranging from similar types 
of university strikes to more radical 

Organizers call for 
three days of action in 
Nov., strike in March.

With a major fee increase rapidly approaching amid systemwide unrest, 
UC President Mark G. Yudof 
announced a new effort to raise 
funds for financial aid over the next 
four years.

Under “Project: You Can,” the 
10 UC campuses will attempt to 
raise $1 billion from private sources 
by 2014. Yudof said he hopes the 
plan will eventually alleviate the 
mounting financial stress placed on 
students as fees increase.

The UC Board of Regents will 
be meeting next month to vote on 
a potential 32-percent fee increase.

But UC Student Association 
President Victor Sanchez said stu-
dents aren’t convinced.

“It’s a [public relations] kind 
of thing,” Sanchez said. “When 
they’re about to raise fees, they put 
together an additional financial-
aid package to go along with it.

It’s an unhealthy and unsustainable 
cycle.”

Yudof also said he is seeking to 
modify the boundaries of the Blue 
and Gold Opportunity Plan  — the 
UC Office of the President’s trophy 
financial aid package  — which was 
originally approved by the regents in 
February. 

The plan currently covers the 
system-wide fees of California resi-
dents whose families earn less than 
$60,000 per year. Blue and Gold 
students with sufficient financial 
need also qualify for further grant 
aid to help reduce the cost of atten-
dance.

Yudof said he wants to raise 
the family income ceiling for the 
plan from $60,000 per year to 
$70,000 per year. Under the pro-
posal change, approximately 800 
more UC students would have their 
system-wide fees fully covered by 
the university. 

“We’re in the opportunity busi-

ness, and even in hard fiscal times 
we are going to be doing everything 
we can to preserve one of the great-
est attributes of the university — 
its rare combination of world-class 
education and research and its high 
proportion of students from low-
income families,” Yudof said in a 
statement.

Vasquez said there are 52,000 UC 
students whose families make under 
$70,000 a year. 

Thurgood Marshall College 
junior Anashe Bandari disagrees 
with the proposal. She said it would 
make more sense to lower fees for 
current UC students than to raise 
them while promising full rides to 
both current and prospective stu-
dents.

“I am helping someone pay for 
their education when I can hardly 
pay for mine,” Bandari said. “It’s not 
fair.”

propositions — like the establishment 
of a tent city in Sacramento and the 
occupation of a Wells Fargo bank in 
Oakland.

On the day’s agenda were discus-
sions about the current state of public 
education, debates on what course 
of action to take regarding it and 
open-floor opportunities for anyone 
to voice their opinion. During the 
afternoon, the conference split into 
four different groups — one for each 
of the UC campuses, state colleges, 
community colleges and K-12 — that 
discussed their individual demands 
and how they could be connected with 
the movement as a whole.

The inclusion of so many sectors 
of public education, while seen as a 
positive development by organizers, 
presented problems, as well.

“There was some conflict,” UC 
Berkeley student Lucy Carrillo said. 
“At the community colleges, they’re 
threatening to take away summer 
school and cut back a lot of money 
from their funding starting in January. 
So a lot of community colleges are 
fighting to have this day of action 
happen before [the March 4th strike].” 

Lucy Carillo, a UC Berkeley stu-
dent, saw the conference’s diversity as 
a huge step toward a successful cam-
paign throughout the state.

“There were students, grad stu-
dents, faculty, workers, unions, par-
ents from elementary, middle and 
high schools,” Carrillo said. “I don’t 
think anybody was left out; we had 
people from all sectors.”

Echoing Carrillo’s beliefs, Angelo 
touched upon the significance of hav-
ing such a wide range of representa-
tives at a conference in support of all 
public sectors. 

“There were also parents there 
who have kids in the public educa-
tion system and there were a lot of 
folks involved in organizing against 
the budget cuts who identify as com-
munity members,” Angelo said. “Folks 
from public sectors as a whole came 
to the conference and said how can 
we work together, how can we bond 
in this.”

Most students in attendance had 
no affiliation with any one specific 
campus political group, representing 
instead the growing numbers of pro-
active students looking for a means to 
fight against rising tuition fees. 

“This was definitely for non-orga-
nizers to get organized,” Carillo said. 
“Most of the people who are going to be 
[influential] in this struggle are going 
to be those who aren’t organized right 
now. There’s a lot of opportunity for the 
different communities to get involved 
in their own movements.”

No representatives of the regents 
or public administrators attended the 
conference. Organizers of the meet-
ing view this as a positive sign and as 
motivation for their movement to go 
even further. 

“Our plan is to go where they are,” 
Angelo said. “We went to the Trustees 
meeting Thursday night and we plan 
to go to the regents’ meeting down in 
LA... The only time they’ve ever tried 
to communicate with us was after the 
walkout and it was a clear attempt to 
get us to pick at each other.” 

The conference’s Continuation 
Committee is currently writing up the 
final draft of their strike proposal to be 
distributed throughout the state and 
presented to the UC administration.

Alleged racial remarks by a vendor on Library Walk —toward an African-American 
student after her booth was robbed 
— made for a prolonged debate at the 
A.S. meeting last night.

During public input, AVP 
Local Affairs Aries Yumul brought 
Tuesday’s “attack on a student of 
color” to the 
council’s attention. 

“This is hap-
pening in 2009 
on our campus 
on Library Walk,” 
Yumul said. “This 
isn’t ignorance; 
there is zero tolerance for actions of 
hatred.”

AVP Academic Affairs and 
University Centers Advisory Board 
chair Jordan Taylor warned the coun-
cil that they might soon see a referen-
dum regarding a Loft programming 
fee of $4.91 per student per quarter. 
He mentioned a potential partnership 
with the Graduate Student Association 
in an effort to lower the fee to $4.04.

Student consultants for the Center 
for Student Involvement Stephanie 
Usry and Tiffany Rivera reminded the 
council of the advantages of One Stop 
for student leaders and organizations.

Campuswide Senator Adam 
Kenworthy discussed his A.S. visibil-
ity initiatives plan. One of the more 
interesting and lesser-known ways for 
students to interact with the council, 
he said, is the A.S. Events Line — a 
phone number that students can call 
anytime for a listing of the day’s events 
on and off campus. The number is 
(858) 534-7529.

A.S. President Utsav Gupta 
announced some recent policy chang-
es that deeply concerned him. He said 
one change to the electronic policy 
allows the university to retain copies 
of all UCSD e-mails for evidence pres-

ervation.
“I’ll look further into the policy 

and see if it is systemwide or if we can 
even reverse this. I know many stu-
dents treat their UCSD email like their 
personal account,” Gupta said. 

Vice President of External Affairs 
Gracelynne West spoke about the 
Nov. 19 UC Board of Regents meet-

ing, where the 
regents will vote 
on a proposed 
32-percent student 
fee increase and 
new enrollment 
cuts. 

Warren 
Senator Alyssa Wing and Sixth 
College Senator Kevin Nguyen said 
only three councilmembers attended 
the men’s soccer and women’s vol-
leyball games last week, and strongly 
encouraged more members to support 
the athletes. 

“After the game, the soccer players 
saw us walking and asked us, ‘If A.S. 
loves us, then why are there only thee 
of you guys?’ We couldn’t refute that,” 
Wing said.

Councilmembers later returned 
to the vendor’s racist remarks to a 
student on Library Walk. Yumul 
drafted a resolution titled “Resolution 
for Adherence to UCSD Ideals of 
Community by Vendors and Non-
Affiliates.” However, several council-
members had issues with its wording.

After numerous failed motions, 
debate continued for about an hour, 
and the council’s official position was 
not resolved by the end of the night.

Marshall Chair Tanvir Dhillon 
attempted to smooth over any hard 
feelings created by the heated discus-
sion with some hopeful words. 

“Even though we may disagree, 
I hope we can still be friends and 
love each other outside of this room,” 
Dhillon said.

External Affairs offices at each UC 
campus to pass an amendment that 
would make Cal Grant funding a guar-
antee instead of something that has to 
be re-approved from year to year. 

UCSD’s external affairs office met 
with Ducheny last week to discuss 
the amendment. So far, however, 
attempts to garner Ducheny’s support 
have been less successful than West 
would have liked. 

“She’s been a strong advocate for 

Cal Grants and for education, but 
… she doesn’t feel strongly that Cal 
Grants should be mandatory funded,” 
West said. “I really hope that we can 
continue to pressure her for her sup-
port.”

West said Ducheny currently 
favors an effort to gather outside 
funding for the Cal Grant pro-
gram over drafting a constitutional 
amendment. 

Though the rally was sparsely 
attended — about 15 to 20 people 

held signs outside Geisel  Library — it 
attracted local media attention. News 
stations like San Diego 6 and Univision 
Televisione, among others, provided 
bilingual publicity for the event.

“We really hope to phone more 
students and really get the word 
out,” West said. “Hopefully, this is 
the start of even stronger press con-
ferences.”

tee’s recommendation is the best evi-
dence of what is important to stu-
dents, so that of course gets a lot of 
weight.” 

Programs that suffered the largest 
cuts included intercol-
legiate athletics, which 
lost $139,314 — or 15 
percent — of its reg-
istration fee funding. 
Career services and 
sports facilities lost 
10 percent each — or 
$107,219 and $40,245, 
respectively. 

The committee 
said these departments 
would have sufficient 
funds to fall back on, 
while still being able 
to maintain services 
because they do not 
rely heavily on support 
from registration fees.

“We didn’t know 
what the final numbers 
were going to be from the [UC] Office 
of the President, so we went through 
everything and just prioritized it 
from highest to lowest,” Bournoutian 
said. “That way we would have infor-
mation to make informed decisions 

on what we think are the services 
that would really impact the students 
the most.”

The committee chose to vary the 
level of cuts by program rather than 
simply cutting all programs evenly 

across the board. 
“We looked at every-

thing to see what was the 
highest priority based 
on number of students 
served, other funding 
sources, basically its rela-
tionship with the mission 
of the university, whether 
or not other programs 
exist on campus that can 
serve those same needs,” 
Bournoutian said. “We 
try to preserve those 
things that only exist 
with that registration fee 
funding.”

Next year, the campus 
expects to face similar 
cuts, leaving the commit-
tee in a similar position. 

“More cuts are going to be com-
ing down the pipeline next year,” 
Committee Chair Erik Van Esselsytn 
said. “We’re going to have to do the 
same sort of priority list for those 
as well.” 

On Oct. 23, UC President Mark 
G. Yudof officially announced a pro-
posal to raise student fees 32 percent  
by Fall Quarter 2010. 

“In the next couple years, all the 
fees are going to go up by a substantial 
amount,” Van Esselsytn said. “The 
cuts coming through the state are 
huge, and they’re not expected to let 
up anytime in the next two years. 
Really the only way to make up lack 
of funds is to raise fees.” 

He said the Registration Fee 
Advisory Committee will aim to 
protect valuable student services 
despite the reductions. 

“For the benefit of all students, I 
think the [registration] fees should 
only be used for things related to 
student life,” Van Esselsytn said. 
“One of the dangers is that the 
UC system as a whole in raising 
its fees is going to start to use the 
registration fees to cover the stuff 
that has lost funding because of 
the state cuts. I don’t agree with 
that, but that’s not to say it’s not 
going to go happen. It’s not within 
a single committee on one campus’ 
power to keep that from happening.”

It’s no secret that we the stu-dents — bio-book worms, co-op art freaks and sorority 
sisters for all — stand disunited. 
Aside from sweaty Sun God Festival 
elbow rubs once a year and starved 
solidarity in the never-ending 
Goody’s burrito line, there isn’t 
much reason for all of us to hang 
out on a Friday night. 

A.S. President Utsav Gupta 
wants to end UCSD’s loner legacy, 
and he thinks he’s got just the pill: a 
Triton football team. 

While the prospect of 
tomorrow’s aerospace engineers and 
baristas alike gathering ’round for a 

pregame tailgate holds 
a certain old-school 
collegiate charm, 
there’s one little detail 
in particular we can’t 
ignore, at least for 
now: those trident-
emblazoned helmets 
and the myriad of 

costs that go along with them.
Gupta is convinced otherwise. 

He estimates that creating a 
Division-II football team could 
cost as little as $1 million annually 

(no more than the total price we 
pay to keep UC President Mark G. 
Yudof and the campus loop shuttle 
around).  

After last spring’s A.S. election 
— which included a poll asking 
students whether they’d support 
the creation of a football team, 
and how much they’d pay for it — 
Gupta is also sure that most of the 
campus is on board, too. The only 
problem with those statistics — and 
the inevitable meager turnout to 
vote on the football referendum 
— is that less than a quarter of 
the student body could even be 
bothered to vote. True, a 73-percent 
majority of those spirited few 
did vote in football’s 
favor — but the poll 
question, of course, 
gave no specifics as to 
how the hypothetical 
team would come to 
reality. 

The survey went 
on to reveal that over 
35 percent of students 
wouldn’t be willing to 
pay a cent for a football 
program. Which 
should be a major red 
flag, considering that long before 
hopping in the pickup and cracking 
open a pregame Bud Light, we’d 
have to open our wallets pretty 
wide — certainly wider than that 
impossibly undershot $1 million 
figure might necessitate. UCLA, 
for comparison’s sake, spent $16 
million on football in 2004 — and 
a scoreboard alone runs for about 
$500,000.

Gupta might not know exactly 
how pricey a football program 
would be, but he can’t deny it would 
be a huge blow for any hurting 
budget. Though the details of his 
football referendum — which he 
plans to complete by this spring’s 
A.S. election — aren’t yet public, 
making ours a school of pom-poms 
and Friday night lights wouldn’t be 
nearly as cheap or simple a task as 
some (well, mostly Gupta) would 
like to believe.

He envisions transforming our 
current track and field facility to 
host football games in its spare 
time. But just throwing a couple 
goal posts around the track 
wouldn’t solve the field issue: With 
over 140 student runners already 
using the facility, there isn’t nearly 
enough space to accommodate a 60- 
to 70-person football team — not to 
mention in the locker room, which 
would get real cozy real fast.

Another big one? Under Title 
IX, a national law in place since 
1972, there must be an equal 
number of male and female athletes 
at every high school and college. 
Though Gupta has said he’d opt 

to add more women 
to our program, he 
hasn’t figured this cost 
into the final price tag. 
Ultimately, additional 
female players would up 
the referendum fee — 
and with the devastating 
academic cuts we’re 
facing, now isn’t the time 
to be increasing our fees 
for frills.

Even if money were 
no object and Gupta’s 

just-add-water plan were free of 
gaping holes in logic, a Division-II 
football team would have one sole 
competitor in all of California: 
Humboldt State University. Their 
team, the Lumberjacks, has a 
mighty four home games scheduled 
for this year; the rest, naturally, 
are out of state. After a few 
snoozeworthy Lumberjack-Triton 
face-offs, our team, too, would be 
forced to jet across the country. We 
can just see the TritonLink bill now.

By no means would we be able 
to smear paint across our cheeks 
and hop over to SDSU on a Friday 
night to show them what we’re 
made of. Supporting the Tritons 
would more likely require hopping 
on a Boeing 757 to Dixie State — 
unless anyone’s down for another 
road trip to Utah.

Gupta says that when you think 
of big schools, you think football — 

which, in the case of UC Berkeley, 
UCLA and USC, might be true. 
But those schools have ancient 
programs whose finances were built 
into the system long ago. A hastily 
concocted Division-II football 
team wouldn’t edge us closer to 
their prestige; it would simply be 
interpreted as a poorly conceived, 
transparent catch-up effort to 
overshadow our nerdier strengths. 

Considering the $234 yearly hike 
in campus athletic fees — voted on 
by students in a Winter Quarter 
2007 referendum — that doubled 
our annual sports budget to $3.5 
million, it’s clear that UCSD values 
athletics. Yet a more reasonable 
first move than declaring the 
second coming of UCSD football, 
and asking students for even more 
money, would be to set our sights 
onto making the jump to Division-I 
for our current athletic lineup. 

This, too, would be a costly 
move. But it makes far more sense 
to invest in already-successful teams 
than to roll the dice on a nonexis-
tent one. Our 1968 foray into the 
football arena resulted in seven 
consecutive losses and no wins. 
We pulled the plug that year before 
embarrassing ourselves any further 
— and if forty years have made us 
any wiser, we’ll keep doing what we 
do best.

Welcome to a brand-spankin’-new column written by the most 
politically disenchanted political-
science major you’ll ever meet.  

I was reminded of my frustration 
with factional partisan politics just 
this past Monday morning, when 
I stepped onto the shuttle and The 
Rush Limbaugh Show was blasting 
at full volume, subjecting the entire 
bus of sleepy students to Limbaugh’s 
infuriating conservative lunacy.  

His vein-popping claim of the 
day was that President Obama is 
intentionally eliminating jobs. Hey, 
what president wouldn’t deliberately 
sabotage his country? 

I closed my eyes and tried in vain 
to ignore his sniggering tone. My 
eyelid twitched spastically. This is not 
what I needed at 10 a.m., trying to 
cram the final details of an obscure 
18th-century French painter for my 
impending art-history midterm.  

My beef with American politics 
is by no means reserved for the 
right-wing. I’m equally repulsed by 
leftist commentary, like that of former 
Democratic National Committee 
chairman Howard Dean, who 
claimed to “hate the Republicans and 
everything they stand for” in 2005. 

Political pundits’ desire to see 
the world as a black-and-white, 
hyperpolarized battlefield between 
the left and the right evokes images 
of muddy-faced brats pulling each 
other’s hair on playgrounds — not of 
educated adults. 

Interestingly, Dean followed up his 
declaration by saying that he admires 
the Republicans’ discipline and 
organization. And he should. Though 
I identify with most Democratic 
ideology, the party is paralyzed by 
internal bickering and unable to focus 
on much-needed policy change. 

Even with a popular Democrat in 
the White House and a Democratic 
majority in both houses of Congress, 
the party is so mired by internal 
conflict that it isn’t even able to pass a 
bill to reform national health care — 
something for which most Americans 
are hankering, and rightly so.

Liberal ineffectiveness runs 
even more rampant on a local 
level. Yesterday’s campuswide press 
conference against cutbacks to Cal 
Grants boasted a crowd of 15 people.

In large part, it’s because the 
average student is turned off by 
extremism — and rightly so.

Instead of comparing Mark G. 
Yudof to Hitler or holding up signs 
with confusing declarations such as 
“Fees Are Racist,” activists should be 
doing more to educate all those too 
busy studying biochemistry to write 
a letter to their local legislator or 
walk out of their class in protest.

An ability to inspire people to 
care about what’s going on around 
them and a willingness to negotiate 
with the “other side” without 
resorting to inflammatory rhetoric 
works. It’s how Martin Luther King 
Jr. slowly eroded away centuries of 
racism and segregation. It’s how 
Barack Hussein Obama became 
President. And it’s the only way to 
work toward change on this campus.

ON THE LINE By Christina Aushana

Dear Editor, 
I am excited to announce the Web 

site The Little Black Book (www.thelb-
bucsd.com) for the students of UCSD. 
This Web site offers various services 
with the intention of creating infinite 
opportunities for students to meet. 
It will give each student a chance to 
venture out of his or her dorm, suite, 
apartment or closed social clique. It 
will give students the opportunity to 
be matched with one of the thousands 
of other students at our campus after 
quickly and easily creating an anony-
mous profile. 

My goal with this Web site is 
to give students a steady stream of 
matches of whichever types of stu-
dents they so desire. This site can 
really cater to any social demand. 
Whether you are interested in dat-
ing, hooking up, making new friends, 
networking or venturing on a blind 
date (try our Daring Pairing service), 
you should become a member of the 
Little Black Book for a year’s worth of 
student matches.  

This site is meant to be fun. But 
it can also play an important role in 
preparing us for life after college. A 
huge part of college is learning how to 
interact with others. We need to know 

how to socialize in various settings 
and the scary fact is: Employers know 
UCSD as the school that produces 
graduates that lack this essential skill. 

The Little Black Book is killing 
two birds (maybe more) with one 
stone. It will balance your life and will 
also push you to be the best that you 
can be — the only thing that looks 
better than a UCSD graduate is a 
well-rounded UCSD graduate!

The deep rooted goal for this Web 
site is to enable the nearly 30,000 
students to make the most of their 
college life while at UCSD. You want 
to be able to look back on this saga of 
life and remember all the experiences 
and story-worthy memories. So, I 
urge you to check out The Little Black 
Book — the site will be up and fully 
running soon.

—James Carroll 
Senior, Marshall College

Treasures
B etween main outfit Deerhunter’s kraut-punk and solo project Atlas Sound’s bedroom dream-pop, 
Bradford Cox gets around. The 28-year-
old Atlanta native just released his second 
proper LP, Logos — a stunning collection 
of singles/concepts without any greater 
ambition to be a statement record.

He told to the A.V. Club back in 
August that he wanted each track to stand 
alone, “like a collage or a photo album — 

snapshots from a lot of places.” Listening 
to the finished recording conjures memo-
ries from last year, when I was obsessed 
with all things Bradford — right around 
the time a half-finished sketch of Logos 
accidentally leaked and Cox considered 
abandoning the project entirely.

I decided I’d pay tribute to the dude 
who’d given me a wealth of sweet music 
and ideas over the past few years — well 
over 100 free songs on deerhuntertheband.
blogspot.com — by culling the top eight 
Bradford blog tracks in what I call the 
Atlas Sound Steezy Hits Mixtape.

1. “Coffin Trick.” Let’s start with 
a spooky number that shuffles and 
jangles, as Cox calls us to “the coffin 

that awaits you.” Released 
last October as a quick 
Halloween treat, the song 
repeats its eerie, raw 
melody over acoustic 
arpeggios until the lo-fi 
tech climaxes with all the 
blown-out overdubs. 

2. “Game of Diamonds (Atlas Sound 
Demo).” This cut might be familiar to 
some: Deerhunter released a mellow 
island version of it on this year’s Rainwater 
Cassette Exchange. Cox’s first sketch of 
“Diamonds” maintains the Motown and 
shoegaze aesthetic he tends to gravitate 
toward; it’s oddly captivating despite its 
utilitarian nature.

3. “Holiday.” Another entry in his 
lineup of sexual-stalker themes, “Holiday” 
is part of a Virtual 7” series that Cox 
helmed for digital consumption, each 
iteration containing its own A and B Side. 
This creepy guitar ballad repeats lines like 
“I hold the knife to your perfect fucking 
face” and “I know your parents are away/ 
So I’ll come over/ We’ll have a perfect holi-
day.” It’s brutal, but Cox manages to make 
it near-endearing.

4. “Rendered.” Part of How I Escaped 
the Prison of Fractals, an ’06 self-released 
CDR that Cox pushed locally and then re-
upped on his blog in ’08, “Rendered” cap-
tivates from the first fuzzy chord strum. 
The rest of the song is decent, but the first 
three seconds — “Two hours back,” Cox 
whispers, and then the guitar rushes in — 
are truly sick.

5. “So Sad (To Watch Good Love Go 
Bad).” This tasty Everly Brothers cover 
proves that Cox could build an entire 
career morphing timeless ballads into 
twisted girl-group Motown. The bouncy 
beat, the reverb, the distortion, the sadness 
— it hits that sweet spot.

6. “Activation.” Uploaded at a crazy-
prolific period in early ’08 when Cox 
was releasing new tunes on a daily basis, 
“Activation” is a standout on his Orange 
Ohms Glow EP. The classic acoustic 
progression and delivery of lines like 
“Activation in the abyss/ Mouth on mouth 
was catalyst” make it a welcome addition 
to Steezy Hits.

B ack in fall 2004, Warren College senior Tristan Newcomb found himself in a slacker’s dilemma. 
He had signed up for an extra-
credit group project in lecturer 
Brett Stalbaum’s introductory 
Computing in the Arts course, 
but — after a couple of distracted, 
Perrier-fueled meetings — he 
soon realized he and his class-
mates were nowhere near moti-
vated enough to develop the video 
game they’d promised. 

“We’re art students getting 
high on fizzy water — so there 
was no way we were going to sud-
denly go around the clock trying 
to finish this thing,” Newcomb 
said. “And so we came up with the 
idea that we were going to have to 
fake it … We’re going to have to 
fake it in such a way that the fak-
ing it was better than if we’d ever 
done anything real.”

So Newcomb recorded some 
video footage of himself and 
other group members navigating 
what he considers to be the worst 
student-developed video game 
ever created. Location: gas station 
on a floating island. Character set: 
a few indiscriminate Lego men 
and SpongeBob SquarePants. The 
objective: to fetch a golden orb 
and exchange it for gasoline. 

On top of it all, Tristan decid-
ed to present the footage to his 
peers as if it were an actual class 
project, using a DVD to simulate 
live laptop projection of the game.

At first, it was just a way to 
dodge the real assignment. But 
once the students started rehears-
ing their performance — a string 
of computer glitches followed by a 
full-fledged emotional breakdown, 
courtesy of Newcomb, as instable 
programmer guy — they realized 
their hoax could be so much more 
than a scapegoat.

However, before they could 
perform it in public, they needed 
the go-ahead from professor 
Stalbaum.

“They were concerned with 
the ethical dimensions of the 
deception, or — possibly closer 
to the truth — they were more 
concerned whether I would allow 
it in my class,” Stalbaum said. 
“They asked me if it was OK, and 
essentially, I only had to give them 
permission to do something dar-

ing … Sometimes, that is all an art 
teacher needs to do.”

The day of their first perfor-
mance went swimmingly — or 
horribly, depending on which 
end of the room you were facing.  
Playing the student program-
mer, Newcomb floundered as his 
shoddy software “froze” on the 
projector screen, and he took to 
filling the awkward pauses with 
bizarre puppet videos and existen-
tial monologues.

Still, his student audience 
remained numb.

“As soon as [students] see 
technical glitches in a presenta-
tion, they begin to disconnect 
and they go into the world of the 
laptop or the iPhone,” Newcomb 
said. “It fed into all their secret 
expectations that this was going to 
be a train wreck anyway.”

On that fateful day in 2004, 
the Gaming Response Resource 
Foundation was born. Since then, 
Tristan has performed before a 

collection of visual arts courses 
at UCSD. Some involved par-
ticipation from Stalbaum himself; 
others unraveled the elaborate 
story of a fictitious GPS student-
tracking system meant to curb 
UCSD’s supposedly severe hit-
and-runs rate.

There was even one 2005 
performance in which Newcomb 
forced a painstaking lecture on a 
crowd of Sixth College orientees.

“That was the one where Brett 
had to run interference for us 
because the Sixth College provost 
wanted to stop the performance,” 
Newcomb said. “Everyone in the 
room thinks it’s real — only we 
and Brett know that it’s fake. And 
once we flounder for 24 minutes 
— and it has to be 24 minutes, 
because the DVD that’s playing 
on the screen behind us is 24 
minutes — we can’t stop it. The 
train’s going down the track and 
there’s no way to get it off the rails 
or to get it to stop without giving 

it away. So we’re having to consis-
tently flounder, and the provost is 
looking more and more irritated 
[at] us, and really disappointed 
with Brett because he isn’t stop-
ping this.”

In the end, Stalbaum 
convinced the provost that 
Newcomb’s presentation would 
teach students an important les-
son on technical difficulties, and 
he was able to wrap up the show 
without interruption.

After a five-year stretch of 
GRRF performances, Newcomb 
has partnered with Eleanor 
Roosevelt College senior Simon 
Quiroz and Revelle College 
senior Roberto Rosales to launch 
Lumalin Productions — a film

THE SOUND OF SUICIDE
POSTPONEMENT
Newcomb teams with UCSD professor 
Brett Stalbaum to spoof malfunction-
ing GPS phones in what is perhaps 
his most infamous video. The starring 
fake offers a concerning statistic: 
UCSD, apparently, is the systemwide 
champion for hit-and-runs, as a 
result of its bizarre “topology.” In 
fact, Newcomb admits to witnessing 
a student being hit by a car — and 
describes it in uncomfortable detail. 
He goes on to explain his proposal: a 
video-game-inspired student tracking 
system. Sweet.

For a spinoff of Trsitan Newcomb’s former Student-
Run Television program “Live Hot Puppet Chat,” his 
Lispy Dog puppet goes medival in an extremely rough 
interpretation of King Arthur’s quest for knighthood. 
Featuring — but not limited to — psychadelic moving 
backdrops, rambling inner-reasoning and a banana 
with bad facial hair claiming to be an ex-cop. Tip to the 
viewer with a short attention span: Pack a bowl. Or two.

ARTREVIEW

THE LAST LECTURE
In this GRRF episode, Newcomb 
poses as a software engineer 
mourning the loss of a student he 
holds dear to his heart. As usual, 
technical difficulties are thrown into 
the mix, and Newcomb resorts to 
cueing a video of “a cats-running-
full-speed-into-table-legs kind of 
thing,” which ends up being a pup-
pet rambling about Tetris. Newcomb 
then admits to posting a video online 
in which he claims to be a profes-
sor giving his last lecture before he 
dies — an admittedly “awkward” 
move after he realized he mistakenly 
diagnosed his illness as fatal.

FILMREVIEW

By Jenna Brogan
Associate Hiatus Editor

R enowned French film director and photographer Agnès Varda (“Cleo from 
5 to 7”) steps in front of the 
camera in this autobiographi-
cal documentary about her life 
as an artist. Shot like a living 
scrapbook, “The Beaches of 
Agnès” is a hodgepodge of 
anecdotes, photographs, home 
videos, interviews, art and 
clips from her filmic repertoire 
that combine to encompass 
her identity and how she views 
the world. 

At the outset, the 81-year-
old introduces the natural 
framework of her life: the 
beach. Throughout the film, she 
explores the ways in which her 
sense of self was created on and 
around the timeless sea — from 

Sète, France, to Venice Beach. 
Known for her innova-

tive art installations, Varda 
frequently shows off an eye 
for finding the extraordinary 
within the ordinary, setting up 
mirrors on the sand to capture 

the angles of the ocean and rec-
reating black-and-white pho-
tographs from her childhood 
with modern-day child actors. 

But the film’s charm rests

HALLOWEEN

La Paloma Theatre in North County carries on its annual Halloween 
tradition this weekend with a special screening of 1975 classic “The 
Rocky Horror Picture Show.” Based on Richard O’Brien’s musical, the 
ﬁlm follows a sing-songy pair of lovebirds (Barry Bostwick and Susan 
Sarandon) who ﬁnd themselves stranded at a mad scientist’s castle. 
There, the two meet a peculiar group of characters, all devoted to head 
of the household Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), from the planet of 
Transsexual. As the questionable professional helps the couple reveal 
their hidden desires, they are forced to examine their true sexuality — a 
true-blue shoutout to the sexual liberation movement of the ’70s. 
Unforgettable song-and-dance numbers will spring to life at La Paloma, 
where a live cast promises to spruce the sex scenes. (JB)

“Saw” installment, here’s an 
update: Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), 
the series’ ﬁrst red-bowed 
torturer, was killed in “III,” 
autopsied in “IV” and is 
somehow still kicking — 
ahem, rolling — in “VI.” While 
it’s unlikely that new fans will 
be recruited by the latest, cult 
followers will undoubtedly 
dig the revamped collection 
of torture machines, puzzles 
and toys. This time around, 
though, selected victims are 
mortgage lenders and health-
insurance adjusters rather 
than people who simply don’t 
appreciate life. It’s all about 
timeliness, right? Heh. (JB)

T hey lost everyone but frontman Andrew Stockdale, and they took four years to release a followup to their debut — yet somehow, 
Wolfmother’s new Cosmic Egg still sounds like the 
second coming of hard rock.

The old trio slammed the airwaves with hits like 
“Joker and the Thief ” back in high school, but with 
the lineup change, the bat-outta-hell sonic assault is 
gone. Instead, Stockdale has crafted a bluesy, mea-
sured sound straight out of Jimmy Page’s garage.

First single “New Moon Rising” starts off quiet 
and void, its verses carried by a hollow drumbeat 
and muted guitars, but explodes into a blues-heavy, 
bring-the-house-down chorus to kick-start Egg. Of 
course, good rock ‘n’ roll always has a little bit of 
the devil in it, and these guitars grind with a dose of 
tuned-down Sabbath grunge — a heavy contrast to 
Stockdale’s wail.

Album standout “White Feather,” though, is pure 
heaven. The choppy rhythm guitar pops along while 
the lead equivalent rambles in never-ending solo, 
ringing pure and clean all the way through the final 
chorus. Stockdale can’t write interesting lyrics to save 
his soul anymore, unfortunately, but some skipping 
Keith Moon drums more than make up for it.

The best part? Each of 12 tracks has the hard-rock 
spirit of Led Zeppelin, and the whole lot runs for 
over an hour of heavy blues. Sure, Stockdale needs to 
think twice before escalating his wail to an earsplit-
ting shriek, but there’s no question that Egg deserves a 
whole lotta love.

Hard Rock? Hallelujah!

T he Swell Season’s Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova may have been produced on an indie-pop assembly line, so perfectly do they melt into the genre’s cookie-cutter mold. Cute and foreign? Check 
— he’s an Irish singer and she’s a Czech pianist. Stars of a sweet, quiet 
cult film? Check — they were the nameless protagonists in 2007’s Irish 
musical “Once,” which spawned Oscar-winning hit “Falling Slowly.” 
On-again off-again tension in the studio? Check — they briefly dated 
before making the film and subsequently broke up (pay attention to this 
one, it’s important).

It’s hard not to dwell on the possibility of true-life romance through-
out the pair’s disjointed new Strict Joy. Hansard and Irglova take turns 
supplying the album’s vocals, each singing from a markedly different 
place; as the album progresses and their lyrics alternate, how not to fanta-
size it as one long duet, chronicling two sides of a complicated love story?

Hansard has one particularly intense moment of moodiness dur-
ing “In These Arms,” in which his whispers and understated whines 
bemoan a failed relationship. Mostly, though, he specializes in cheerful 
songs of celebration a la “Back Broke” and “Feeling the Pull.” They’re 
mind-numbingly upbeat, with just-complex-enough background noise 
and simple, swooping vocals that invoke nothing so much as the jubila-
tion of being free.

In contrast, Irglova puts her songbird to good use with downbeat 
medidations on sadness like “Fantasy Man” and “I Have Loved You 
Wrong,” alternating between dreams of an imaginary lover and apologies 
for the harm she has inflicted on the one sitting next to her. (We assume. 
And hope.)

The two narratives meld together in the final and best song of the 
album, “The Verb,” on which the two lament: “I’m tired of fighting she 
said/ Your words just rattle my head/ All  joy escapes in the dark/ And I 
can’t make this make sense.” It’s OK, guys — we’ve got no problem filling 
in the blanks.

‘Once’ Lovebirds Make Sweet Narrated Love

S omewhere in the midst of toying with side group Megapuss and sleeping with Natalie Portman, freaky folker Devendra Banhart managed to churn out some cuts for seventh studio 
album What Will We Be. Unfortunately, the effort doesn’t live 
up to the tinge of eccentricity we’ve come to expect from the 
listener-friendly hippie.

Either he’s been spending a lot of time blazing in Topanga 
Canyon or recently reached BFF status with Jack Johnson, 
because Banhart’s freak flag is flying half-mast at best. Topping 
out at 14 tracks (all his other albums have run between 16 and 
22), What Will We Be sees Banhart treading dangerously close to 
main-mainstream.

The album begins with a few upbeat numbers, sprinkled with 
cheery lyrics that achieve warm fuzzies without giving way to 
nausea. “Can’t Help But Smiling” showcases slow, suave vocals 
on a smooth melody of drums, shakers and tinkery piano keys, 
making it almost impossible not to flash a few pearly whites. The 
folkie even dabbles in foreign languages on a few tracks, keeping 
up his charming hipster image.

Everything goes smoothly until mid-album, where the beat 
slows and shit starts to really drag. Both “First Song for B” and 
“Last Song for B” (yeah, he gets over B pretty quick) are lone-
some, downright depressing piano ballads with the same effect 
as Jude Law’s receding hairline — they instantly make the whole 
package a lot less attractive.

Final track “Foolin” is somewhat of a saving grace — an honest 
attempt at letting our spirits free — but after having been rocked 
to sleep, we hardly notice the Banhart’s recovery from depression. 
In other words, the album wastes a solidly entertaining start with 
a terrible second half. Let’s just hope this isn’t a peek into his bland 
new crystal ball.

WORLD FAMOUS HAMBURGERS

FILMREVIEWS

By Gretchen Wegrich
Staff Writer

B ased on the life of Sandra Laing, “Skin” is the story of a black woman born into a family of 
white Afrikaners in apartheid-era 
South Africa. Raised as culturally 
white, Sandra (Sophie Okonedo, 
“The Secret Life of Bees”) struggles 
to define herself amid her parents’ 
expectation that she marry a white 
Afrikaner. 

Although 
Anthony 
Fabian’s film 
is framed 
by racial 
conflict, it 
succeeds by 
transcend-
ing what is 
expected of 
an apartheid biopic, emerging with 
an empowering feminist message 
from a meditation on love, family, 
betrayal, reconciliation and the self. 

Bookended with textured footage 
of South Africa’s first free elections 
in 1991 and starring actors who look 
like photocopies of their real-life 
counterparts (we catch a glimpse at 
the end), the film nearly masquerades 
as a documentary, leaving us to won-
der whether we’re just sitting through 
a collection of someone else’s home 
videos. 

While Okonedo, the film’s only 
big-name star, fails to steal the 
screen from Alice Krige — who 
shines as Sandra’s mother Sannie 
— she brings Sandra’s emotional 
turmoil to life with an expressionless 
face and body language that betrays 
her character’s physical insecurities. 
The mother-daughter relationship 
are explored throughout, as both 

characters 
are tested 
by the 

stubborn cruelty of Sandra’s father 
(Sam Neill). 

The story begins when a young 
Sandra (Ella Ramangwane) is sent 
to boarding school. The color of her 
skin immediately subjects her to peer 
abuse, and after being re-classified 
as “colored” by the school doctor, 
Sandra is expelled. Maddened by the 
decision, her father takes the issue to 
the Supreme Court, asking his daugh-
ter be permanently classified as white. 
But as the girl reaches adulthood, she 
realizes that no matter what her birth 
certificate says, the world will always 
identify her as black. 

Rebelling against her domineer-
ing parents, Sandra runs away with a 
young black man named Petrus (Tony 
Kgoroge). Disowned by her father, 
she must forge her own path out-
side of the society in which she was 
raised. Her mother, meanwhile, is left 
behind to weather a marriage turning 

increasingly bitter with the years. 
It is only when Sannie is torn 

between a duty-bound love for her 
husband and enduring sadness at the 
departure of her daughter that Krige 
becomes a profoundly conflicted — 
and finally interesting — character, 

letting some 
of the film’s 
most power-
ful themes of 
betrayal and 
reconciliation 
come to the 
forefront.

It is only 
after Sandra 
has broken 
free of the 
masculine grip 
on her life that 

she is able to forge her own sense of 
self. The film’s powerful voice on tol-
erance, love and identity make “Skin” 
more than just a bra-burning soap-
box, and instead a thought-provok-
ing take on the human experience.

in its quiet humility, as Varda amus-
ingly waddles backward down the 
street to visually demonstrate her 
movement into the past. The film 
is entirely in French: An English-
speaking audience is asked to 
read along as the pop-up book 
unfolds with fantastical characters 
— including a troupe of acrobats, 
Harrison Ford and an animated 
Cheshire cat that speaks like a robot 
alien.

While these various digressions 
are at times erratic and difficult to 
follow, Varda creates smooth transi-
tions between the stages of her life, 

gluing each segment to the next 
with the sound of a door creaking or 
images of gondola-jousting. 

From life as a young girl to cin-
ematic force — and, finally, wrapped 
in a love affair with fellow director 
and husband Jacques Demy — Varda 
reconstructs her own history by 
visiting the actors who appeared in 
her films, floating down the Seine in 
a yellow sailboat and setting up her 
production company’s office in an 
outdoor sandbox. 

But Varda is a character in her-
self. With a red-and-silver bowl cut, 
the body of a matryoshka doll and 
the swagger of a mallard, she tells of 

her futile efforts to be a joyful femi-
nist, her fascination with the Black 
Panthers, her love for the plastic 
colors of summer and the feeling of 
helplessness that overcame her as 
Demy succumbed to AIDS. 

The biggest beauty of the film, 
however, lies in the fact that we do 
not need to know anything about 
Varda to appreciate her artistic 
eccentricities and innate goofiness. 
So relax and allow Schubert to fill 
your head as one of French cinemas’ 
greats guides you through the life of 
an artist — to a place where fact and 
fiction, collide and complement one 
another in delicate harmony.

The ﬁlm nearly 
masquerades as 
a documentary, 
leaving us to 
wonder whether 
we’re just sitting 
through a
collection of 
someone else’s 
home videos.

and made it difficult for players to see the turf and 
for goalies to track shots on goal. 

The Coyotes’ first goal came in the 69th minute. 
The Tritons answered back a quick five minutes 
later, when junior midfielder Shane Micheil nailed  
his fourth goal of the season from 30 yards away. 

Despite UCSD’s comeback, a game-winning 
Coyote goal sealed the Triton defeat. 

In their Oct. 25 game against Cal Poly Pomona, 
the Tritons’ offense had no answer to the superior 
Bronco defense. The Broncos managed to eek out 
the game’s lone point for a narrow victory. 

“[It was] a bit of an uninteresting game,” senior 
midfielder Jonathan Sawyer said.

Pomona’s only score came just after halftime, in 
the 47th minute, as senior forward Kevin Ramirez 
knocked a rebound shot past senior goalkeeper 
Peter Akman into the lower left corner of the net. 

Each team notched six shots apiece in the first 

half. Triton junior midfielder Shane Micheil and 
senior forward Tony Choi led the way with two 
attempts each. 

The Tritons have dealt with a frustrating year, 
all seven losses have been decided by a single goal. 

The team’s annual Senior Day will take place at 
a Nov. 1 home game against Cal State Dominguez 
Hills. Seven graduating student athletes will be 
honored for their accomplishments on and off the 
field before a final home game in Triton uniforms. 
The graduating seniors are Akman, Choi, Sawyer; 
midfielders Scott Gressard and Kyle Parton; and 
defenders Chris Guitierrez and Daniel Pavitt.

The Tritons will be  back in action Friday to host 
No. 7 Cal State University Los Angeles at 4:30 p.m. 
The Golden Eagles boast an impressive 15-2-1 over-
all record and an 11-2-1 mark in the CCAA.

Along with assessing the student body’s interest, 
the survey asked how much students would be will-
ing to pay in additional fees to support the creation 
of a football team. 35.59 percent of students said 
they were not willing to pay any money at all. The 
remaining students expressed — on average — that 
they would be willing to take on an extra $19.46 
per quarter to create a Triton football program.

Gupta said he has taken the current University 
of California budget crisis into consideration in 
planning the football referendum. 

“Things are tough, and you’re forced to priori-
tize,” Gupta said. “I think that if a football referen-
dum can survive in this market, then it does show 
support within the student body. Sure, there’s more 
likelihood for it to fail than it probably would have 
three years ago, but I think that students can make 
value judgments as to where their money wants to 
go. This is not us forcing a fee on the student body 
— this is us asking students what they want.”

Gupta said a UCSD football team could provide 
students with a necessary and missing component 
of the traditional college experience.

“When people think of big schools, they think 
of football teams,” Gupta said. “We have a super 
majority saying that they would actually pay to 
support a team.”

In researching the feasibility of a football team, 
Gupta worked with Vice Chancellors Steven Relyea 
and Penny Rue to come up with an estimated bud-
get. He produced an estimated figure of $1 million 
to 2 million a year — a total that Gupta sees as 
compatible with what students are willing to pay, 
based on last spring’s survey.

While Senior Associate Athletic Director Ken 
Grosse said he would support a UCSD football 
team, he also expressed concerns about its logistics.

“There are all the start-up costs that we’d be 
looking at: the equipment, the additional people that 
are working here,” Grosse said. “We don’t even have 
room now to store what we need to. It’d be great to 
have a team, [but] I just don’t see it working.”

UCSD currently plays at the NCAA Division-
II level. Because Humboldt State University is the 
only other D-II school in California, the UCSD 
football team would have to travel to other states 
in order to play games — adding additional travel 
costs to basic program needs.

“There are only a dozen D-II schools west of 
the Mississippi, so you’re talking about some pretty 
heavy travel costs,” Grosse said.

Grosse added that in the past decade, only a few 
colleges have successfully created a football team. 
According to Grosse, these examples cannot be 
compared to UCSD, because two of the schools — 

the University of Connecticut and the University of 
South Florida —already ran powerhouse Division-I 
athletic programs beforehand, and had existing 
funds and facilities to support the new team. 

Another obstacle in a UCSD football team’s 
future would be Title IX, a national law created 
in 1972 that requires men and women’s athletic 
teams at the high-school and collegiate levels must 
remain in equal balance. As stipulated by Title IX, 
there must be an even number of male and female 
athletes at any one institution. This means that if 
UCSD were to add a men’s football team — which 
would require anywhere from 60 to 90 student ath-
letes according to Grosse — the university would 
have to add the same number of female athletes or 
subtract from the men’s total. 

Grosse sees Title IX as an impossible obstacle. 
“We’re in compliance with Title IX right now,” 

Grosse said. “So if you add a football team, we’d 
have to do one of two things: You either make an 
equivalent addition on the women’s side or cut the 
equivalent on the men’s side. For how much foot-
ball is going to cost, you’re talking about decimat-
ing the men’s program. At least four or five teams 
would have to go.”

Gupta said he is aware of Title IX, but remains 
optimistic.

“The idea that we’d want to cut men’s teams to 
make room for football is simply not true,” Gupta 
said. “What we’d be after is creating women’s 
teams.”

Gupta does not currently include any such 
details in his planned referendum. 

In terms of home-game location, Gupta’ envi-
sions the use of the Triton Track and Field Stadium. 

“The track and field was actually constructed 
with the foresight of allowing a regulation football 
field,” Gupta said. “All you’d have to do is get rid of 
the inner jogging track and make a small adjust-
ment to the track, and you’d have a regulation foot-
ball stadium.”

Men’s track and field coach Tony Salerno said 
that adding a football team to the space would 
present several problems.

“The stadium is not configured for football, so 
there’s no goalposts or a scoreboard,” Salerno said. 
“We have just over 100 [athletes] in track. Facility 
issues would be complex.”

If students pass the referendum this Spring 
Quarter, Gupta believes that the football team 
could officially begin play by Fall Quarter of 2011.

“It would take time to get coaches, to start train-
ing players and recruiting,” Gupta said. “I think that 
that would take about a year to do.”

MEN’S SOCCER — The UCSD men’s 
soccer team continued its slide last 
weekend, falling in a pair of one-goal 
games at home against Cal State San 
Bernardino and Cal Poly Pomona on 
Oct. 23 and Oct. 25, respectively. The 
Tritons’ losing streak now stands at 
four games, leaving them 7-7-4 overall 
and 4-7-3 in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association play.

The Tritons made a late-game 
push but lost 2-1 against Cal State 
San Bernardino. Two days later, they 
couldn’t notch a single point against 
Cal Poly Pomona, and lost 1-0. 

Despite a strong defensive effort for 
two-thirds of the match, the Tritons   
swallowed a tough loss after allowing 
two Coyote goals over the final 20 
minutes. A thick fog engulfed the field

SWIMMING & DIVING — The 
Tritons inaugurated the newly 
repaired Canyon View Aquatic 
Center with a victory against their 
visiting Claremont-Mudd-Scripps 
opponents at the UCSD swim team’s 
Oct. 24 2009-10 season-opening 
meet.

“I am very happy where we are 
at as far as racing,” head coach Scott 
McGihon said. “This was an out-
standing first meet.”

The Triton women emerged 
with a dominant 180-115 win, while 
the men’s team scored an equally 
impressive 197-97 victory over the 
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps swim-
mers.

Collectively, the UCSD swim-
mers and divers won 23 of the day’s 
32 events.

The Tritons had multiple win-
ners in several individual events. 
Freshman Katherine Tse and senior 
Daniel Perdew both took the 50- 

and 100-yard freestyle heats for the 
Tritons, while junior Anju Shimura 
won the 100- and 200-yard back-
stroke events. Additionally, fresh-
man Bethany Dong and senior 
Jereme Barnett-Woods both won the 
500- and 1000-yard distance events.

The relay teams on both sides 
were equally successful. Shimura 
partnered with teammates Tse, 
sophomore Mercedes O’Brien and 
junior Jessica Ferguson to win the 
200-medley relay with a time of 
1:48.87. 

The men’s team — which includ-
ed Perdew, freshman Julius Espiritu, 
seniors Juan Pablo Carillo and Todd 
Langland — took the same event on 
the men’s side with a time of 1:34.05.

The meet marked the first official 
competition for the diving team. 
Freshman diver Tyler Runsten wast-
ed little time making an impact in 
his first NCCA competition, win-
ning the men’s one-meter and three-
meter diving events. 

He scored an impressive 290.85 
in the latter event — despite the 
fact that the diving team has been 
unable to practice their full rep-
ertoire, because Canyon View had 
been closed for about a month.

“I wasn’t even sure what dives we 
were going to do,” Runsten said. “We 
haven’t been diving three meters due 

to the pool situation, so I just went 
for big dives. I have no regrets. I am 
proud and happy.”
McGihon was particularly pleased 
with Runsten’s performance. 

“He was outstanding,” McGihon 
said. “Considering it’s his first meet 
as a first-time freshman, [it was] 
very impressive.” 

Runsten said his performance 
expectations can be credited to his 
team’s cohesion heading into the 
season.

“The team thus far has been a 
great experience,” Runsten said. “I 
love this team. We hang out every 
night.”

McGihon said he would like 
to continue developing the team’s 

dynamic, and is keeping his eye on 
of the long-term goal of making the 
NCAA National Competition.

“We need to work on our level 
of focus,” McGihon said. “With the 
pool open, it’s better for everyone. 
We can enjoy some continuity and 
flow to training. We want to win 
these league meets, but preparing for 
the NCAA is the longer-term plan.”

The UCSD swim and diving team 
will look to build on last Saturday’s 
results when they visit San Diego 
State on Nov. 6, where the Tritons 
will compete against hosts Aztecs 
and Texas Christian University.

Both the men’s and women’s teams defeated Harvey-Mudd-Scripps in UCSD’s first team home meet.

With repairs to Canyon 
View pool finally finished, 
the swim and dive team 
made a victorious return.

R iding on the results of a survey on last Spring Quarter’s A.S. election bal-lot, A.S. president Utsav 
Gupta said a referendum to create 
a student-funded UCSD football 
team is currently in the works. 
Gupta aims to have the refer-
endum on this Spring Quarter’s 
student ballot.  

According to Gupta, the sur-
vey showed that students not only 
want a football team, but are more 
than willing to pay for its creation.

Asked if they would sup-
port the creation of a Division-II 
Intercollegiate Football team, 
72.65 percent of the 5,174 stu-
dents who voted in the election 
said ‘Yes,’ 17.75 percent voted no 
and 9.6 percent abstained.
