A Weel~ly Survey of 
Local and State News 

New Student Regent Picked 
Michael Salerno, the newly named student regent, thinks the rising 

cost of attending the University of California is keeping some people 
from attending UC. 

"I think the fees are starting to get out of hand," Salerno, a UC 
Davis law student, said after being named 'to the one-year post on the 
Board of Regents at last month's Regents' meeting in San Francisco. 

Salerno-whose term a8 student regent begins July I-was selected 
by the regent. to the position from a field of three candidates proposed 
by the Student Body Presidents' Council. One of the other candidates 
was Mark Mochary, a graduate student in anthropology at UCSD. 

Salerno will replace UCLA's Daryn Peeples, student regent for 1976-
77. 

Brown, Saxon Clash Again 
Gov. Brown and UC President Saxon clashed again at last month's 

Board of Regents meeting, this. time over Brown's plan to freeze the 
pay of state employees earning more than $50,000 per year. 

For his part, Brown-who makes $49,500 annually-said UCSD em-
ployees should recall the spiritual past of the university . 

"The university is like a church," the fonner Jesuit seminarian said 
at the meeting, "Its origins are out of certain medieval institutions 
and as such, I think its life style should be more appropriate to the 
original. When it isn't it tends to scandalize, I won't say the faithful, 
but the pubUc." 

" Past attempts to enact 
collective bargaining proposals 
have been hampered by dissension 
among the various employee 
groups," Berman noted. "Having 
achieved an early consensus this 
time, we should be in a much 
stronger position," he asserted. 

Art Bierman, President of the 
United Professors of California 
(UPC), an American Federation of 
Teachers, AFL-ClO union of 3,800 
CSUC faculty, hailed the proposed 
legislation in a statement last 
week. 

"Collective bargaining rights for 
CSUC and UC faculty are overdue. 
They are the only teachers in 
California that don ' t have 
bargaining rights, Bierman said. 
" Passage of Berman's bill will 
complete the bargaining picture 
for teachers in California and will 
restore equity, " he concluded. 

Campus Reaction MIxed 
Reactions on this campus were 

mixed in their support of the Ber-
man bill. Virginia Lopez, president 
of the UCSD chapter of the 
California State Employees 
Association (CSEA), felt the 
legislation "is long overdue." 
Further, she said, "There is a need 
for it." 

Jim Stronski, president of UCSD 
local 2068 of the Association of 
Federal, State, County, and 
Municipal Employees (AFSCME) 
said his union "basically supports" 
the collective bargaining bill. He 
continued,"U's not everything we 
want, but we can live with it." A 
problem he saw with the bill was 
the lack of a provision for " binding 
arbitration to arbitrate 
stalemates. ... The bill should 
really have binding arbitration or 
the right to strike. But since the bill 
is mute on the right to strike, it 
doesl1't say you can or you can't, 
we still have that weapon. Like I 
said, we can live with it." 

"We'd Go Out of Business" 
However Tom Tribble feels that 

his group, the UCSD staff 

association, " would go out of 
business" if the legislation is 
passed. The Staff Association, a 
self -proclaimed vehicle of com-
mWlication between its over 500 
members and the administration, 
is, Tribble stated; " by definition 
not a collective bargaining agent." 
In discussing the situation that 
would exist if the Berman Bill is 
passed, Tribble said " that would 
have to be viewed as death blow for 
the Staff Association and staff 
associations everywhere ." 

Tribble termed collective 
bargaining for the staff members 
" a good thing in the theoretical 
sense. In the practical sense," he 
continued, " there are ways to 
achieve the benefits of collective

Night Rider Shuttle Bus 
Begins Service Next Week 

The Rape Task Force's efforts in obtaining a night time shuttle bus 
have been realized. 

The Task Force, working through Vice-chancellor and Dean of Student 
Affairs George Murphy, showed what they tenned the " necessity" of a 
shuttle. 

Called the "Night Rider," the shuttle bus will begin on a trial basis 
April 11 , running from 8:00 pm to 12:00 pm Sunday through Thursday. 
The need and use of the Night Rider will be a main detenninant for its 
continuation next year. 

The total cost for the service will be approximately $3200, with funds 
being split up between the Business Office and Registration Fees. 

"The van will hold twelve passengers, and the relief drivers from the 
Coast Cruiser will drive it," said Cathy Hauer of the Task Force. "The 
shuttle is scheduled to circulate the campus about every twenty minutes. 
Men and women who are going anywhere on campus will be encouraged 
to walk along the bus route, so that the bus can pick them up as it passes 
by." 

The roote will be patrolled by police, and the shuttle will also include a 
citizens band radio to provide corrununication with police. If a student is 
walking along any route the shuttle can be flagged down, though the bus 
stops are well lit and close to all major housing and study facilities . 

The Night Rider's scheduled run starts at Central Library and makes a 
circle around the perimeter of the campus. The entire route takes 15 
minutes. Times and a map of the run are featured on the last page of the 
paper. 

In reply, Saxon-who hauls down $62,500 annually-said he would 
fight Brown's proposal. However, he conceded that the 'public will 
probably back the governor on his plan. 

Former "Acid Guru" Speaks Here 
"I don't sense any great wave of enthusiasm for those who earn 

$50,000 or more," said Saxon, who this year donated about $9000 of his 
salary back to UC. 

UCSD's Rep .Running Again 
Gil Johnson, The San Diego City Councilman who voted to recom-

mend that the UCSD Bike Sbop stop its retail sales activity, announced 
last week his candidacy for re-election this year. . 

Johnson, 70, who was first appointed to the council in 1971, and won 
re-election in his own right in 1973, became first incumbent coun-
cilman to declare his intention to seek re-election this year. 

In announcing his candidacy last Wednesday, Johnson cited city 
costs and tax rates, crime, planned growth and San Diego's unem-
ployment rate as the big issues confronting the council. 

Besides voting with a colD"lcil majority to recommend closure for the 
Bike Shop's retail activities, Johnson also voted in favor of both the 
North City West and University Town Center developments. 

Johnson's first distiict includes La Jolla, Mira Mesa, North 
Clairemont, Scripps Ranch, University City, Del Mar, Rancho Ber-
nardo and UCSD. 

Campus Employee Killed 
One U~D employee, and two former UCSD employees were among 

the 576 persons killed in history's worst airline tTash March rT. The

Tim leary is Now Headed for Outer Space 
by Joel C. DoD 

Aaoda(.e News EdItor 
During the cultural tumult of the 

1960s, Timothy Leary's message to 
the world was to "turn-on" to 
altered states of consciousness 
through the use of various 
chemical hallucinogens. 

But society's reticence at this 
radical departure from so-called 
normal behavior sent Leary 
through a nightmare of courtrooms 
and three years "on the run" in 
Europe and Asia. 

Now, reUeved of drug possession 
charges, legal battles and prison 
terms, Leary plans a new " trip" or 
voyage, with the aim of 
establishing colonies in space 
where people can " Uve, work and 
play" and enjoy a "better Ufe." 

He shies away from the tenn 
"utopia," insisltlng that there will 
be many colonies of different in-
terests, each having its own unique 
problems. 

Leary spoke here last week in a 
lecture titled "The American 
CUlture (1MS-1915)," sponsored by 
GRIN, a student group amuated 
with the 1.-5 Society. The L-5 
Society promotes space habitation 
in artificial satellites orbiting 
Earth and the potential ute of these 
satelUtes for solar power.

Bakk~ Decision Debated 
SupJ>ort Equal Edu~tion 

In the Trltorl Times 01 March 2, 1m, an article entitled "Bakke 
DecIaion Suppcirted, Prejudice Is 'Unacceptable' " by Scott Reidler 
appeared. 'lbe UCSD Studem eo.IItian Agaimt Raclam believes that 
Mr. Beidler is misinformed on several points and that his arguments 
distort tile realllBue; tile ri8ht to an equal education. 

ReIdIer btpns by complabdng tbat the "TrIton times even implied 
tbIIt the 150 people â€¢.â€¢ were all tb.-e to rally qajDst the Bakke Dedaion", 
.. furtber states tbIIt be "aDd IDIlDY otbers bad just been IllteniDI to 
band." TbIs mUes no sense since there was no band! We wonder If 
Reidler did in fad attend tile rally! 

ReidIer eGIdID .. , apIa!n .. tbat be sappor1I tile Bakke dedsIoa and 
that be beJieyes ''that moet people doallo." We oftbe Student Coalition 
wonder wllere .. ,ets bIIlDformation. Up to tbls date there baw been 
DO 'p~Bakk. DecIsiGa' rallies tb8t we !mow 01. 

Indeed, 'anU-Bakke DecIsion' mobIllpUoas have taken place CO~ 
sistently since Noveblber 1978 throughout the state. They include: 
several MECbA conferences, a statewide conference 01 Ofti' 500 people 
In Berkeley; rallies at UCLA, ~, UCB, UCSB, UCD, U<E>, CSULA, 
along with city-wide rallies ~ San Diego, San Jose, Los Angeles and the 
Bay area. The Bay area rally was the moet ~ with over 2,500 In 
.~ce. . 

Again, we must ask, why is Beidler blessed with such an accurate 
Insight Into the opinions of the 'sUent majority?' 

Heidler's arguments go downhill from there. He even resorts to the 
thinly veiled racist argument that "a white pre-med student Is supposed 
to get-used to the fact that he may work much hanJer than a minority 
student and stUI be rejected before the minority student." Reidler 
associates "harder work" with superior Intelligence and ability, and by 
Inference casts a shadow on the sincerity of minority students. 

He continues by attacking the argument for special admissions, 
saying "the fact Is that by ~ed schools' own standard'l,. the mln~rity 
student Is not always as qualified." A study by the UCB Amn Amencan 
Law Student Association showed that there was absolutely no 
correlation between the traditonal entrance requirements used for 
admission to undergraduate and graduate schools (SAT, LSAT, MCAT, 
GPA, etc.) and how well the students did once they were .admltted . 

The correlation that was revealed, showed that the hIgher GPAs and 
entrance test scores tended to belong to applicants that were white and 
well-off: 

Heidler's problem is that he chooses to ignore the social context of the 
Bakke Decision. In his sterile schema the issue is some 'nebulous 
discrimination. ' 

We strongly disagree: the issue at hand Is the right to an equal 
education for 3rd World Americans. 

Reidler chooses to support a decision that sets the precedent for 
returning admissions standards to the way they used to be before the 
student movement of the 1960s. If the Bakke Decision succeeds it is quite 
possible that UCSD will return to the way it was in 1969 when there were 
only 20 Chicanos on the entire campus. 

You see unlike Reidler, we really are opposed to discrimination and 
racism. That is why we are for the reversal of the Bakke Decision, the 
withdrawal of all US interests from South Africa, freedom for the Camp 
Pendleton 14. and so on. Join Us! UCSDSCAR 

Eliminate "Unnatural" Quotas 
The Bakke controversy comes at a most inopportune time for un-

dergradute education at the University of California. Indeed, .regard~ess 
of the upcoming decision by the US Supreme Court, the Immedlat.e 
salient danger is that affirmative action will be put to sleep before It 
even had an opportunity to mature to its intended fruition: 

The Bakke dilemma specifically raises the question: do quota 
systems for the enrollment of historically disadvantaged minority' 
constituencies into graduate and professional schools constitute a 
flagrant fonn of discrimination? 

In a sense, I agree, they do. 
Yet for me, speaking from my own experience of affirmative action at 

UCSD the apparent unfairness of special minority admittance progr~ms at the graduate level serves as a predominat Indication that 
affinnative action programs must be strengthened and expanded 
rather than dismanUed. 

The primary problem of note in the Bakke dilemma is not the question 
of "discrimination" or "reverse discrimination." To argue on such 
grounds is self-evidenUy a futile exercise in semantics. The quin-
tessential problem is the quota system itself. 

Quota systems by definition mean regulation. Regulations are im-
posed when gross imbalances are perceived in the equilibri~ within 
the system or the frame of reference of concern. 

Specifically, with regards to affirmative action, it is evident t~t 
given the percentage of the population in California that are ethniC 
minorities and the percentage of minorities "qualified" by universally 
accepted modes of criteria (e.g. GPA and aptitude tests) to graduate 
school, the "lIatural" equilibrium has been disrupted. 

For, althOl.gh etlmic minorities constitute almost 30 per cent of the 
population of tHe state of California, less than half of that per cent attend 
school at the graduate level. 

I grant th~t /ninority enrollment quotas at the graduate school levels 
are "unnatural" remedial tools. I agree also, that quota systems that 
are umatur~1 should be eliminated. 

The most to.ical mode 0' c1imiNItin(l the quotas involved here Is to 
increase the ~source pool of affirmative action minorities " qualified" 
for graduau school. This in turn mellJUl that an enlarged resource pool 
must be culti~ted and qualified ethnic constituencies be admitted into 
the UC syste<Jliat the undergraduate level. 

You see, there is another quota system inherent in the system that 
must be eliminated. This is the quota system at the undergraduate 
level, which maintains the percentage of affirmative action minorities 
below the corresponding percentages of these constituencies in the state 
population. 

The lJC educational system must become more equitable and ae-
cesible for all constituencies in California. AU quotas and barriers at 
both the undergraduate and graduate levels must be tran8cended. 

And this means that " affirmative action" policies must be vigorously 
fonnulated and pursued at the undergraduate level in order to eradicate 
long standing historical barriers and quotas everyone seems to have 
ignored.

Start Conserving Campus Water Â· 
Granted that I do not have at 

hand staUstical evidence for what I 
am about to say, I would Uke to 
submit something today in the way 
of a reminder to the students, 
faculty and staff of UCSD because 
I address myself to a problem that 
is getting worse every day that it Is 
ignored. . 

As we must all have heard by 
now, ihrough the media or by word 
of mouth, our sisters and brothers 
to the north are experiencing the 
effects of one of the most severe 
droughts in the history of 
California as one of the "united" 
states. 

Since San Diego and vicinity has 
received substantial yearly 
rainfall, (for a change,) we are not 
immediately able to perceive the 
severity of the problem. But this Is 
not just another nunor or a scheme 
to raise the price of water! 

As we go progressively north-
ward, even as close as Los 
Angeles, the evidence becomes 
more obvious since supplies of 
water to the southland from the 
north are being cut off. There is 
already a problem and with the 
present, seemingly delightful 
weather and summer on the way, it 
will get to be more and more imÂ· 
portant that Yie conserve the water 
we have and share it. 

Steve Grady 
For President 

Yes I'm here and I have been an 
active member of the Ski Club for 
four years. I hav.e seen Steve 
Grady rise to the presidency of the 
Ski Club and I must say he has 
done a job. The Ski Club has had 
the dyno parties, lots of beer and 
all the chicks. 

Yah! 
The all-Cal trip was a blast. 

Grady not only arranged the trip 
but he also put everyone's twelve 
dollar rebate into the Ski Club's 
fund for more parties. 

Right on! 
I'm glad he put the money to 

good use instead of giving it back to 
those who went on the trip. 

Everyone tells me that the only 
reason Steve Grady Is running for 
president is because he wants to 
take his URS degree to graduate -
school. Well, I know that isn't so. 
His fathe!; got him an internship 
with Senator Talmadge. of Georgia 
because Steve really wanted to 
participate In government. 
Graduate school is the farthest 
thing from his mind. 

I'm looking forward to the 
eltctlon in the next few weeks. I'm 
sure when Steve Grady graduates 
at the end of the fall quartel nellt 
year, he will have done an ex-
cellent job, Ask Geronimo, he'll tell 
you. 

JOHN KING 

I don't believe that UCSD has yet 
recognized this fact or made ef-
forts to save water on a campus-
wide basis. As residents and/or 
citizens of the US we have become 
accustomed to the thoughUess use 
of resources which are valuable 
and appreciated luxuries in many, 
if not most other countries. These 
include natural fuel, (another 
limited resource, more necessary 
in colder parts or the world, and 
something we will realize In. 
time ... ) and water as well as many 
others. 

The point I am trying to get 
across Is that a lot of water is 
currently being wasted at UCSD 
and that If we care about others 
who need it more, this waste is 
unjustifiable. 

will name one specificaUy, as1 am 
hoping to elicit some inter-campus 
cooperation whicb wlll be 
necessary to our success. 

Here we have toilets all over the 
place! While the SOIItbland as a 
whole is supposed to be trying to 
nush less water down the drain, I 
have yet to see an unflushed toilet 
at UCSD! This suggests to me one 
of two things, either that we are 
using our toilets only for "serious 
business," (a term I use only to 
respect the tender ears of some 
people) or that we are wasting a lot 
of water on just this one point! 

A sign I saw in one bathrootn, 
which brought a smile and which I 
considered to be more than graffiti 
said: 

"Save H2O! 
If it's pee, let it be. 

Basically, what we need to do to If It's brown, flusb it down." 
remedy this is to think about what Whether or not the joke is foony 
we are doing. If every person to you, the point is valid! I don't 
would ask himself each day. "What think we would be offending others

Reinstate Will Wright 
Dea r Dr. Saltman: 

As a sta ff member and student at 
UCSD, I am voicing my opinion 
regarding Professor Will Wright. 
On the Staff Development 
Program I have been taking one 
credited Sociology course each 
quarter since 1973. ~aving gra~ed 
the corridors of higher learnmg 
since 1950, I have never found a 
professor more dedicated to the 
care, motivation, and thoughtÂ· 
provoking inquiry of the student 
than Professor Wright. Not only 

We received these two letters 
coucemlng ProfcsHr WiD Wript 
from Dorta JODeS, a UCSD _taft 
member aDd_tude â€¢. 

Sociology 143, taught by Professor 
Wright, is overflowing with eager 
students, attempting to make some 
scnse out of the current social 
s ituations. We don 't have to attend 
class, but we do . I have never 
relished writing a term paper but 
in this class 1 am looking forward 
to the assignment with high ex-
pectations from myself to put out 
an intelligent, wellÂ·thought-out 
paper. I feel that anyone who can 
command this much respect from 
his students is worth keeping. I 
also feel that it wo Id be a grave 
mistake for UCSD to permit the 
slipping through of its fingers of 
such magnificent talent in the field 
of higher education as possessed 
by Will Wright. 

Commentary 

does he stimulate his students to 
healthy thought but he also 
remains with the pertinent 
question until it is delved into on a 
much deeper level than mere class 

. entertainment. 
I have found most of his classes 

to be very depressing yet I have 
come away with a feeling of 
gratitude that someone is exposing 
social problems in an intelligent 
manner. Possibly this way they 
can be dealt with. This quarter 

Won't you please seriously 
consider giving your students at 
UCSD the benefits of associating 
with and learning from Professor 
Wright? I strongly urge you to give 
the students at UCSD the high 
caliber educational opportunities 
that they so much desire by 
keeping Professor Wright on the 
faculty at UCSD.

Dear Dr. Davis : 
Using my innate right as a student 
to demand quality education, I 
question the decision of the faculty 
of the Sociology Department to 
release Professor Will Wright from 
his enormous contribution toward 
higher education here at UCSD. 
Intending no cynicism at all, I 
wonder about the selective process 
for faculty members. Students 
enrolled in Professor Wright's 
classes respect his leading role in 
exposing the inner machinations of 
the power structure in the United 
Statee as well as his inciteful expos~re on the exploitation of the 
innocent. . 
Tn an effort to find an acceptable

tactic to persuade you to recon-
sider Professor Wright's right to be 
here I would like to invite you to 
see 'firsthand Dr. Wright's efÂ· 
fective appeal with the students 
before you make your decision on 
his, as well as our, future here at 
UCSD. 

As you well know, a month ago, I 
asked Dr. Paul Saltman to pursue 
this issue. At this time, I am urging 
you to seriously consider a fair 
appraisal of Professor Wright. 
With all due respect,

professor doing in shoes?" 
It no longer pained him to talk 

about it. After all, he had been in 
ladies shoes for five years already. 
His adjustment had been 
facilitated by the Panglossian 
philosophy that what must happen 
will happen, and that when it does 
it will be the best thing that could 
have happened. "I'm pleased that 
you recognized me after all these 
years. Let me tell you why [ 
relinquished my professorship and 
how I was born again-don't 
laugh-as a salesman. 

"Several years ago I was given 
the Distinguished Teaching Award 
al the convention that 
psychologists hold each year. On 
the flight back to State I could 
hardly wait for congratulations 
from my family and colleagues. 
Chimerical as it now appears, I 
even fantasized a welcoming 

committee of town and gown 
dignitaries, like the mayor, the 
university preSident, the ~rts and 
sciences dean , and a student 
delegation. It turned out that no 
one greeted me at the airport, but 
it was the diMer hour and the days 
were becoming shorter as people 
were preparing for the fall 
semester. 

" What happened next is not to be 
believed. My colleagues never did 
congratulate me for the teaching 
award. Worse still, they went out of 
their way to ignore me. The 
psychology faculty squirmed in 
torturous embarrassment at the 
thought that their reputations as 
hotshot researchers were 
irrepa rably tarnished by the 
. econd-rate image which my in-
famous award reflected. I became 
a nonperson.

Works 0 Ruth Landay 
Fir e Art in the Science Library 

by Debbie Sdnrartz 
StaffWrHer 

How often we find the smaU 
inspirations that give us en-
joyment, and insight into life, in 
the most unlikely places! Each one 
of us has at some time ur another 
been touched by a verse of grarfiti 
scrawled across as wall or the tune 
of a merry whistling busdriver. 
One doesn't have to read a classic 
or go to a symphony to enjoy a 
renewed look at life. And there is 

, 

no law reservlng valid art for 
musewps and galleries. 

For instance, here on campus 
you can find some interesting fine 
art in a science building. Many 
students who use the Science and 
Engineering Library in Urey Hall 
are undoubtedly aware of this , for 
the showcases lining the entrance 
ha 11 to the library are presently 
filled with some delightful pain-
tings, collages, and line drawings 
by a local artist, Ruth Landay. 

These pieces of artwork , all done

within the past ten years, are the 
culmination of some 50 years of life 
experiences encompassing what 
Landay refers to as a vastly 
"expanded landscape." Born in 
1917 in New York , Landay was 
largely self-taught and greatly 
influenced by the post-
impressionists of the 1930s. She 
attended the University of Buffalo 
and, after moving to California, 
received her BA in Art from UC 
Santa Barbara. She taught art in 
the California public school 
system, retired and is now a full-
time independent artist. 

The display consists of acrylic 
paintings, pen and ink drawings, 
pastels, watercolors and collages. 
The drawings develop th~ir fonns 
through the cultivation of con-
tinuous, nowing, curvilinear lines, 
which are also evident in the 
paintings. Landay's works also 
portray the influence of abstract 
and German expressionism and 
many of her forms and shapes are 
distorted for the purpose of fonnal 
and stylistic exploration. 

Structure manifests itself in 
Landay's work. Many of her 
drawings bring to mind the 
molecular or cellular framework 
which underlies the physical 
world. Landay sees this structural 
element in her art as an 
" awareness' of expanded world 
vision," which rapidly developed 
during her lifetime through science 
and technology. 

Landay offers this advice to 
aspiring art students : " Do a lot of 
WOrk, be aware of what is hap-
pening in the art world, and allow 
yourself to be influenced as much 

a~ possible by professors." She 
feels that one has one's entire life 
to develop individual potentials.

IITango~' at the Corter--A Tragic 
Force from Behind the Iron Curtdin 

by Margaret Hewey 
Staff wrtter 

Nobody seems to mind_that thE! 
house looks like a dump. Or that 
dad parades around in pajamas all 
day with his fly open. Or that Mom 
is having an affair with the ser-
vant, who plays poker and guzzles

They're just Bohemians bucking

years d rebelling against con-

formity and order so they could 
enjoy these fruits of freedom and 
anarchy. But what happens when 
there aren't any conventions left to 
rebel against - when it all becomes 
passe' to be Bohemian? 

Contrary to the connotations of 
the title, Tango is not a porno play 
or a story about dancing. It's 
political farce/tragedy by Polish

makes a serious point about in-

surface. 
Here we go again--another 

political/intellectual Cassius 
Carter Center Stage production. 
Director Craig Noel notes that 
"this play's more substantive 
values reflect that throughout 
history, mankind is continuously 
intimidated and threatened Â· by 

. many forms of tyranny in the 
unceasing pursuit of personal 
liberty and individual freedom." 

But fortunately the play is not all 
business-there's comedy to jazz-it-
up, making it more bearable. And 
playwrite Mrozek worked hard at 
making this piece as madcap and 
shocking as possible. In fact, he 
had to nee Poland when Com-
munist authorities banned Tango 
after its premiere in 1965-the 
audience recognizing it as political 
satire. 

Director Craig Noel also worked 
. hard at making the scenes as 
comic and incongruous as possible, 
and ofthen succeeded. Designer 
Brigitte Sitte contributed wittily 
with her set and costumes. 

Set in pre-World War II Poland, 
the play involves the conflicting 
ideals of a conservative, Â· con-
ventional son and his Bohemian, 
free-spirited family. Arthur (Hugh 
Monaha n) is sick ofthe dlsorder. 

And no wonder, Grandfather's 
easet is still in the livingroom, an 
old baby carriage and mother's 
wedding dress are dumped behind 
the couch, junk and family relics 
are strewn all over the place. 

As for the family members-they

Dr. Littleman 

Dear Doe: III what field do yoa 
bold year dldente? 

Left field . Seriously, I hold my 
doctorate in Foolosophy, i.e. a 
Foo. D. There are many examples 
of foolosophy, and they are found in 
many places. Witness the 
following. 

I know this saxophone player 
who is as good as any I've ever 
heard. He also sings like an angel. 
He does both as a living. Recently, 
I asked him to go hunting with me 
and he said, 'I'm no good at that. I 
just can't get the hang of it.' Fine. 
Can't be good at everything. He 
didn't feel inadequate, he didn 't 
stay home reading "The Joys of 
Hunting" in order to become a 
great shooter. He just ignored it. 

But if a pretty young lady had 
asked him if he would like to go to 
bed with her, is there any chance 
that he-or anyone else-would have 
said, "No thanks, I'm not good in 
bed. You go on to bed without me"? 

Just as aD of us in this country 
can't possibly be pro golfers like 
Arnie, it's fairly certain that the 
men among us can't be aU God's 
gift to women when it comes to 
performance in bed. Just as in 
every other skill, there must be a 
vast groundwork of average lays to 
support those few who are 
dynamite in the sack and who lord 
over those who are just plain lousy. 
But somehow we've gotten this 
notion into our heads that if we hold 
our mouth right, smile a lot, read 
the right books and think pure 
thoughts, every last man of us can 
make the girls see comets blazing 
in the dead of night. 
. I doubt it. ... So what we have is a 
staggering population represented 
by a prototype who is a relatively 
poor screw and either totally 
unaware of it or seriously anxious 
about it and buying up books and 
devices , learning the gentle art of 
massage, reading "How to Pick Up 
Sheep" and what have you-
ignorant of the fact that he will go 
to the grave pretty much the same 
run-of-the-mill bed partner he was 
when he first fogged up the win-
dows of his dad's Chevrolet. 

If you're one of those people, you 
may not even know it. And with 
every one talking about sex so 
openly, it's amazing the subject of -

Good vs. Bad never comes up, so to 
speak. You can do whatever'kind of 
sex play your perversion can think 
up, and it makes perfectly 'ac-
ceptable cocktail talk. But mention 
how rotten your technique is (not to 
be confused with impotence-you 
can do it, sure, you're simply no 
damm good at it) and see what 
happens. In fact, it's almost as bad 
as admitting you can't play ten-
nis .... 

There seems to be little we can 
do to improve the quality of 
screwing in this country, short of 
appointing panels of men and 
women to Test Screw samples of 
the population as it reaches the age 
of consent. Those found lacking 
would, of course, be put to sleep. 
Because when you give it serious 
thought, it is a problem deserving 
national attention. Suppose the 
Russians are better in bed? Are we 
going to allow a Schlup Gap to 
develop? 

Probably the best think to do is 
just admit the average truth and 
learn to love it. After all, any 
nation that can learn to love 
Jolumy Carson, General Motors , 
The New York TImes, Linda 
Lovelace and McDonald's aU in 
one century can't be demanding 
too much in the clinch. So drop the 
machinery and philosophy and just 
go get Mc~id. 

Watch for more foolosophy from 
far-fetched sources in the future .

The job of the Legislative Analyst is to provide the History of Offtce

Post uses the pronoun " we", meaning him and his staff, Post said. " There is a separation of powers and we are going 
when talking about his work. He speaks with obvious pride to have to be critical of the executive programs and the 
about the 54 professionals on his staff and the high quality of Governor's Budget." 

"The governors disagreed and they argued, but they 
never challenged our rig~ or responsibility to make the klild 
of recommendations we do. And they never, except in 
maybe one instance, said we were doing anything im-
proper." 

That one instance occured in 1973 when Gov. Reagan 
called a special electioo to enact his tax limitation plan. 
Reagan's plan, designated Proposition One on the ballot, 
would have reduced the amoWlt of state taxes Californians 
pay by .1 per cent per year from the 1973 level of 8.3 per cent 
to a coostant 7 per centof their income. 

In his analysis of Prop. I, Post said, " It will obviously 
reduce state subsidies to local government, state payments 
to individuals (such as Medi-Caland senior citizens property 
tax assistance) and state operations such as the University 
of California and the State Colleges. The poor counties will 
fare badly . ,. 

Angered by Post's opposition, Reagan attacked the 
Analyst and his office. He said Post had made "deliberate 
distortions" in his analysis of the proposition. 

The Legislature responded to the Governor with bipar-
tisan support for their Analyst. Post's own response was no 
response. " I don't debate governors," he said. "That's not 
my function ." 

Struggle on Prop. ODe 
Recalling the struggle over Prop. One, Assemblymember 

Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) said, " Post had to be far 
more liberal than he ever dreamed he would be just to save 
the people of the state. If there's a liberal bone in his body, 
Reagan brought it out." 

Other than the Reagan affair in 1973, Post said he has had 
amicable relationships with the governors, including Jerry 
Brown. 

"We don't agree on a number of things," Post said. "But 
in most respects, we agree about efficiency and economy. " 

"There are thousands of items in the state program and 
we disagree on a lot of them ," Post said. "After he con-
siders what we have to say, it's surprising how often they 
tend to agree (with us) next year. " 

He and the governors have had the same basic objectives 
about 90 per cent of the time, Post said. But when dif-
ferences have arisen, they have been over the relative value 
of programs receiving state funds. 

"We by and large disagreed on the University of 
California with Gov. Reagan," Post said. "Not so much with 
respect to the amoWlts of money as it was with how you deal 
with it. What constitutes a University? What are its values? 
How do you deal with it (and be) fairly tough on dollars?" 

Retirement Immfnent 
Post will turn 63 in September. He has already annoWlced

It's Spring--New

by RonKato 
Sports EdItor 

The arrival of spring means the 
opening of another intramural 
season and this quarter's activities 
will be highlighted by an ex-
perimental free agent softball 
league as well as three new 
tournaments. 

The free agent softba U league 
will be structured to allow athletes 
to participate in as many as three 
leagues (men's/women's, coed and 
the free agents ) without jeopar-
dizing the eligibility of playoff 

Further information concerning 
the rules and entry deadlines of 
each tournament can be obtained 
in the recreation gym office. 

Besides softball , which will be 
offered in three d ivisions (men's, 
women's a nd coed), the volleyba ll 
program wiII be expanded to in-
clude an all men's and all women's 
league. Indoor ' soccer , th ree-<>n-
three basketball (men and women 
leagues only) , innertube waterpolo 
and team tennis (coed leagues 
only) will round out the sporting 
events for the quarter.

Softball is only one of seven intramural sports on tap for this quarter. The others are innertube waterpolo. volleyball . 
rndoor soccer. three -onÂ·three basketball . team tennis and free agent softball. 
bound teams. The aim of this 
league is to cut down on the 
number of individuals par-
ticipating on two teams within the 
same men's women's or coed 
divisions ( grounds for team 
disqualification), while providing 
students with more playing time. 

In addition to the free agent 
softball league, the new tour-
naments to come into the In-
tramural scene this quarter will 
include an over-the-line contest 
(April 30), a wrist wrestling match 
(May 7), and competition in one-
on-<lne basketball (May 8 ). Also, 
scheduled for May 1 is a coed 
doubles volleyball tournament. 

Team meetin.gs for captains or 
representatives of the sports will 
start Thursday and continue into 
the second week . If a team is short 
of a full roster or if an individual is 
Wlable to get on a team, at-
tendance at the meetings is also 
encouraged. All meetings will be 
held in the recreation gym con-
ference room on the following 
dates :

with a 'good worldeg relationship 
with the adminil,1ration are one 
way. This type of relationship has 
worked well for the Academic 
Senate," Tribble concluded. 

According to a representative of 
the Academic Senate the iss:Je of 
collective bargaining was a topic of 
much debate two years ago when it 
appeared the item would pass the 
State Legislature. "We have not 
discussed the matter recently, and 
there is far from unanimity among

the faculty on the matter of 
collective bargaining," the 
representative concluded. 

Much of the impact of the 
legislation, if passed, would be felt 
in the campus personnel office. 
Nick Atma, Manager of Employee 
Relations for the personnel office, 
works as an ombudsman for 
employee problems. "If collective 
bargaining does come about," 
Atma said, "it will have an impact 
on personnel relations. The im-
pact, however, depends on the 
players. It is too early to tell if 
collective bargaining will have a 
negative or a positive impact. If 
the bill is passed, we'll do our 
damnest to abide by it. If It doesn't 
pass, we'll still do our damnest to

ideology, wortz explanied the works of Rothko and Irwin. Rothko's 
minimal, monochromatic panels are empty, nebulous grounds, "to be 
filled in with the viewer's own personal feelings and meanings." They 
depend on "the quality of liglt upon them to portray the inner glow that 
flows from them." Robert Irwin, who is also interested in the experiential 
rather than the objective realm of art, creates works that involve a 
"perceptual act on the part ofthe viewer." 

Upon careful observation of his disc paintings, the viewer perceives a 
merger of the figure and ground. This unity signifies "an enlightened 
state or level of Nirvana" in the viewer. Irwin also designed a three story ' 
plex\glass plate that was installed in a shopping center. As the natural 
light of the shopping center changed throughout the day, the shaft of light 
created by the plexiglass was transfonned into various illusions and/or 
reflections, the validity of which was imperceptible.

Wortz feels that "fascination with light has to do with the inability to 

hold or capture it. II This evasive and immaterial quality is the core of art 
works by Dan Flavin, Larry Bell and Dwayne Valentine, among others, 
Dan Flavin's experiments with neon light employ "light as a thing." The 
light from his florescent tubes "permeates out, affecting the surrounding 
space," Larry Bell applies the illusory character of light refraction In his 
work. Wrotz described one of his large pieces as a "maze of ephemeral, 
illusionistic walls." Dwayne Valentine's cast polyester resin objects 
reveal "light suspended in space." 

Wortz concluded with an inspiring comment: "There is a strong 
spiritual level in contemporary art that could bring solace to many who 
are so desperately seeking altered states of consciousness." In the words 

. of a famed yogi, Paramahansa Yogananda, "God's first command

UC-881 Not EDolllb 
On the administrative side, Dr. 

Archie Kleingartner, UC Vice-
President of Academic and Staff 
Personnel, told the Triton Times in 
a telephone interview last week 
that the University "has great 
concern with a collective 
bargaining bill that does not ~ 
clude all state employees." 
According to Kleingartner, " the 
University is in the process right 
now of doing a detailed analysis of 
the bill. We will be making our 
concerns known in the Stale 
Legislature and in other ap-
propriate areas." To sum up the 
University's position? "We've got 
problems with the bill." 
The proposed legislation buildson

Commentary._ 
Coatbaaed from Page I 

"My 'colleagues' reasoned that they had not built State's eclat as a 
leading graduate psychology faculty by frittering away their time in the 
classroom. They had attracted brilliant graduate students and bollnteous 
grants on the basis of flashy research achievements, not on such 
worthless fiddle-faddle as teaching prowness. Even the university adÂ· 
ministration let it leak out that my Distinguished Teaching Award 
troubled them because they were convinced that this would deflect the 
lion's share of research grants state would have ordinarily attracted, and 
it was predicted dolefully that this would lead to a critical shortfall in 
overhead funds. 

" Even a few of the younger faculty, more interested in transmitting 
than in creating knowledge, looked the other way when they passe<! me in

tenure, or reappointment- did not want to dampen or ruin altogether

productive and equitable way to 
determine issues of mutual con-

far superior for all concerned" he 
said, " that matters such as 
working conditions, grievance 
procedures and so on be resolved 
by the employees and employers 
themselves rather than having to

case now." 

"There will, of course, still be

and the Governor on issues With

requiring legislative action since 
they serve as the public's 
representatives," Bennan added. 

Berman observed that the 
"foundation for collective 
bargaining for employees in the 
educational system was set by 
Senator Rodda in SB 160. I think it 
makes eminent sense to extend this 
principal to the UC and CSUC 
systems so that all employees of 
the public education system enjoy 
the same rights and responÂ· 
sibilities."

acknowledged that I had considerable talents outside the classroom. she

knew that her chances for a respectable postdoctoral berth would be nil if 
faculty at other universities found out she was teacher's pet.

Assembly Speaker McCarthy supports Post's statement. "We will first 

have to look and see if there is a competent person in the Analyst's

Babies cry when they are born, 
proof of a keen insight benied such 
lesser mortals as adults. And when

the very first things it sees is the 
grinning face of a parent: one of 
those smiles one sucker gives

The fact of the matter is that 
people often die for better reasons

Dying from cancer is a better

And yet, this dogged insistence

The human imagination is 
wonderful thing, isn't it? Basically, 
it separates the men from the boys 
in the animal kingdom. Bound to a 
rude intelligence, imagination 
becomes a fearsome thing, a sad 
thing. Even in its most feeble 
manifestation, the human 

imagination can conceive a better 
situation for itself. Few men are so 

unimagm.tiv~ that they can't 
envision something better.

only thing he can't imagine at aU, 
is that he can't imagine. . 

And man can imagine God. 
Rea lly, . this was quite an 
achievement for man, to imagine 
that something could be greater 
and better than he is. Of course, 
there was and is a certain amount 
of pride involved in the concept of 
God. 

One of the preconditions of God is 
that he COMot be stuck here on 
earth with the rest of us. That 
would never do. How would you 
like it if you lived next door to God? 
You'd have to do everything God 
said. A god should be close, but not 
get in the way.

Post has painted with both oils

his paintings throughout the state,

his wife, who is a sculptor,

Henson also noted that NASA has

habitation as a source of solving 
the energy crisis. The space 
satellites can beam solar energy 
from the Sun via microwaves to the 
Earth, without the terrestrial 
problems of night and day and

In an attempt to demystify the 
notion of space and space

attacking the notion of "macho"
