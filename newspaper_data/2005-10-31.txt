SRTV porn turns 'political' 
York's latest shows mock sex with senator 

By MAn L'HEUREUX 
Senior Staff Writer 

One day after the A.S. Council 
passed an Oct. 23 amendment 
banning pornographic images 
from being aired on Student-Run 
Television, John Muir College 
senior Steve York rebroadcast a 
video with an overlaid image of an 
A.S. senator in place of the adult-
film actress featured in the clip. 

The face of Thurgood Marshall 
Senior enator Kate Pillon , a 
staunch supporter of the ban against 
"graphic sexual activity involving 
nudity" on SR'TV, was secn in place 
of the actress engaged in sex with 
York when the video was replayed 
on Oct. 27. York, who spoke of his 
disapproval of the amendment at 
the Oct. 26 A.S. Council meeting, 
had warned councilmembers that 
they "could nor win" the battle of 
censorship when it came to free 
speech and RTV content. 

Pillon, who made public her 
vote to ban pornography during 
an open discussion at the meeting, 
stated that although she recognized 
the intent of the piece to be hurtful, 
she understood on a professional 
level that it could also be seen as 
politica l sati re of a public figure . 

"I've voted all along that this 
kind of explicit sexual acts shouldn't 
be on SRTV," Pillon said. "Because 
I've voted that way, I was attacked. 
They tried to make it personal, to 
have it get to me, but they haven't 
and they can't." 

Students 
face GRE 
revamps 

By SERENA RENNER 
Contributing Writer 

A dramatic nverhau l of the 
Graduate Record Exami nation 
taken by nea rly 500,000 gradu-
ate school hopefuls is slated for 
October 2006, primarily aimed 
to enhance security measures and 
increase validity, according to the 
Ed ucationa l Testi ng Service. 

After four years of research, 
ETS is changing the structure and 
contentofthe GRE, modifying the 
emphasis in each of its th ree sec-
tions to include more "rea l-life" 
scenarios. The new format will 
make tests unique for each stu-
dent and require a wide range of 
questions. Other changes include 
increasing the test time from two-
and-a-half to four hours, and lim-
iting the number of times the test 
is offered. 

However, the Princeton Review 
sees a different reason beh ind the

Screen strugIe: Thurgood Marshall Senior Senator Kate Pillon was unwillingly involved 
with "Koala 1V when her face was superimposed into a pornography segment 

The amendment, passed in a 
14-8-0 vote, was a topic of con-
troversy not only among the stu-
dents attending the meetiJlg, but 
council members as well. Senators 
debated the legality of the nudity 
ban, which some believed could be 
seen as the A.S. Council imped-
ing the station's First Amendment 
rights. The majority ultimately 
decided that the legality of the item 
was best left up to the university's 
lega l counsel, and could not be 
adequately interpreted by the scna-

tors.

Manager Andy 'Tess, neiciler he nor 
his partner were prescnt at the sta-

Online wiretap rules 
dial up tuition hikes 

.yGRACE WU 
Contributing Writer 

The Federal Communications 
Commission has asked universi-
ties to accommodate new wire-
tap laws, which could cost cam-
puses $7 billion overall and $450 
more in tuition for each student, 
according to estimates from the 
American Council on Education . 

The new regulations, issued 
in August, are a modification of 
the Communications Assistance 
for Law Enforcement Act from 

1994. The federal law ensures 
that law enforcement agencies 
receive access to conduct court-
ordered wiretaps. The order 
will make CALEA applicab le 
to [nternet phone traffic, and 
broadband Internet access pro-
viders, which includes universi -
ties. 

While there is an FCC-man-
dated 18-month deadlin e for 
compliance, the process could 
be slowed down by a lawsuit

I CURRENTS 
Davis researchers 
dispel beer myths 
Despite popular belief that beer is 

a source of unhea~hy carbohydrates, 
researchers at UC Davis have found 
the drink can actually be beneficial in 
many ways. 

1he message for consumers is 
that the on~ sustainable and sensible 
way to lose weight and avoid weight 
gain is to focus on the calorie content 
of all foods and beverages, induding 
beer: Charles Bamforth, chair of the 
UC Davis food, science and technol-
ogy departmen~ stated in a press 
release. ':.\nd they should remember 
that contrary to popular thought 
beer is not comprised mere~ of 
empty calories. Rather, it can contain 
significant levels of vitamins, antioxi-
dants, minerals and fiber.' 

In the research, Bamforth notes 
that the South Beach Die~ the brain-
child of Arthur Agatson, had initiallr. 
coined beer as a fattening alcoho. 
As a result Bamforth found that a 
slew of 'Iow-carb" beers, which con-
tained no more than seven grams of 
carbohydrate per serving by federal 
standards, began to come into the 
market 

However, the specialized ' Iow-
carb" beer is only a superstition, 
Bamforth said. 

'In truth, the majority of beers 
on the market contain relatively low 
levels of carbohydrates: Bamforth 
stated. "Furthermore, alcoholic drinks 
that contain mixers such as ginger 
ale, cola, tonic and tomato juice are 
far more charged with carbohydrate 
than is beer.' 

KSDT forced to 
change Web site 

Due to an unexpected expira-
tion of its Web srte registration, and 
a loss in a bidding war, KSDT radio 
has been forced to move from the 
Intemet home it has known for five 
years. 

During the summer, the radio 
station, which was broadcast exdu-
sively online at http://WNW.ksdtradio. 
org had gone offline because of 
an expiration of its five-year con-
tract with Aim High!, Inc., according 
to former Operations Manager Kip 
Mitchell. The staff had been unaware 
of the contract's deadline because 

of leadership changes and missing 
paperwork. Its domain name was 
then bought by a 'drop catchinlt 
service, which routinely buys Web 
sites to resell to the fomner owners, 
Mitchell said. 

'Irs ridiculous: he said. "Vvhat 
other place would want Qur domain 
name, anyway? We're the on~ radio 
station named KSDf' 

Bartering with the company 
proved unfruitful, since its demand 
was far too high for KSDfs budge~ 
Mitchell said. The radio station has 
since utilized an old university-pro-
vided Web site for broadcasting. 

Because of a powerful ad cam-
paign since the beginning of the 
school year, KSDT has managed to 
keep a consistent patronage despite 
the domain name change, according 
to Station Manager Leo Bondar. 

'We pushed hard to get the new 
name out there: he said. 'On cam-
pus, students seem to know where 
to go to hear us. But we did have a 
good amount of listeners outside of 
UCSD, and since they're not here to 
be notified of the news, we've lost a 
lot of them." 

The radio station had to eat the 
cost of banners advertising the old 
domain name, Bondar said. In addi-
tion, KSDT had to spend around 
$100 in advertising its new Web site, 
http://WNW.scw.ucsd.edu. 
. The radio. station could regain 
Its old domain, and plans to wait 
a few more months to continue 
negotiations with the current owners, 
Bondar said. 

Regents to field 
putilic questions 

A UC Board of Regents commit-
tee will hold a speciar meeting Oct 
31 to address the public and deter-
mine various regents' procedures 
including splitting future regents 
meetings into four two-day sessions, 
with two meetings a year to be held 
in Southem Califomia, and two a year 
in Northem Califomia. 

Members of the public will be 
able to pose university-related ques-
tions or comments to committee 
members through a telephone con-
ference at (510) 987-9220. 

Committee members include 
Regent Peter Preuss, UC President 
Robert C. Dynes and Gov. Amold 
Schwarzenegger.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEW 3 

FCC: Deadline for wiretap called unrealistic 
continued from page I 

filed by Educause, a nonprofit 
organization, and A.C.E. A.C.E. 
has already taken the lead in legal 
action against the government 
and filed the initial papers that 
reserve its right to sue, according 
to Educause Vice President Mark. 
Luker. 

"In filing suit, we hope to 
convince the FCC that colleges 
and universities can provide the 
same access through alternative 
approaches without the need to 
incur the $7 billion expense of 
revamping our computer network 
systems," A.C. E. Vice President 
Sheldon Steinbach stated in a 
press release. "This alternative 
approach also would make it 
more efficient for law enforce-
ment. When you evaluate effi-
ciency versus the incredible cost 
of compliance, we just don't think 
it makes a lot of sense." 

While FCC spokesman Mark 
Wigfield declined to comment 
about the lawsuit, he said that 
the agency is currently consider-
ing an exemption to educational 
institutions. 

A.C.E.'s calculation for the 
cost of implementing the new 
system was derived from the 
FCC's requirements. 

"Drafts of the standards ". 
strongly suggest that a cam-
pus will be required to pro-
vide access points [for lawful 
surveillance) deep into the net-
worle, requiring extensive replace-
ment and reconfiguration of net-
work equipment. 

"This fact, and the large num-
ber of campuses in higher educa-
tion, drive the overall size of the 
A.C.E. calculation," Luker said. 

Although Wigfield also 
declined to comment about the 
actual cost of installing new 
wiretap systems, the potential 
financial impact is a major con-
cern for UCSD and would be 
a "bottleneck" in meeting the 
FCC's requirements, according 
to Academic Computing Services 
Director Tony Wood. 

"What we're concerned about 
is the expense," Wood said. "If 
it requires a lot of money to do 
something we never have to, we 
don't want it." 

Although ACS is uncertain of 
the technological specifications of 
the wiretap regulations, there are 
two scenarios of how the new sys-
tem will be installed, Wood said. 

"It's uncertain how much it 
would cost because we haven 't 
seen what [installing new systems) 

would require," Wood said. 
According to Wood, there can 

be either an inexpensive or more 
costly approach. 

"[The inexpensive meth-
od) would enable a device that 
would watch ingoing and outgo-
ing Internet traffic. An analogy 
would be tapping a telephone 
switchboard." 

The pricier method would 
involve replacing hundreds of 
internal switches and approxi-
mately 30 to 40 routers, which 
are devices that relay computers 
to the Internet. 

The 18-month deadline is not 
enough time to comply with the 
requirements if the expensive 
method is implemented, Wood 
said. 

"Tapping requires a court 
order, which are very specific to 
a person or location and can only 
be obtained by a law enforcement 
officer," Wood said. "Campuses 
have been responding to wiretaps 
for years. It's not something that 
is done often, but we respond to 
it because it is a legal obligation. 
This order is to prepare ourselves 
for a reque t." 

Readers ran contact Grace Wu at

GRE: Money could be motive for test changes 
continued from page I 

format change. 
"The new test will contain 

new question types that have 
never been tested on any stan-
dardized exam, it will be an hour 
and a half longer, it will have a 
new scoring scale, and it will be 
less convenient for studenrs to 
take," aid Liz Wands, Princeton 
Review's national director of 

graduate programs. "How doe 
that make a more valid te t? 
ETS only makes changes when 
their pocketbook is affected, and 
they're changing the exam to 
save money." 

ETS is looking to rid itself 
of the current computer-adaptive 
version, which is more expensive 
because it requires a constant 
need for fresh question pools, 

Wands sa id. 
However, finances played 

no role in the GRE's change, 
according to Director of External 
Conununic3tions Tom Ewing. In 
fact, ETS will have to shoulder 
additional expenses by creating 
30 different tests and increasing 
the number of online test centers

When Universities Fight Back 
Government-mandated wiretaps are an unnecessary financial hardship 

By MEGAN DURHAM 
Contributing Writer 

W ith students looking at steep tuition increases, no one wants to hear 
about a looming unfunded federal 
mandate facing universities that 
are already dangerously over bud-
get. Especially one with a $7 bil-
li on dollar price tag. But unfortu-
nately that is exactly what univer-
sities across the country are facing, 
all due to a recent extension of an 
II -year-old law. An order issued 
by the Federal Communications 
Commission "extends the provi-
sions of a 1994 wiretap law not 
on ly to universities, but also to 
libraries, airport ... and com-
mercial Internet access providers," 
accord ing to the fW York Times. 

T he order deals primarily with 
new Voice over Internet Protocol 
(Vo l P) technologies, which allow 
users to make telephone ca lls 
over an Internet connection rath -
er than a traditional telephone 
linc . Basica lly, it make it easier 
for law enforcement authorities 
to monitor these technologies. 
Justice Department spokesman 
Paul Bresson argues that such an 
order is nece sa ry: "As communi-
cations technologies develop, we 
must ensu re that such progress 
doc~ not come at the expense of 
our nation 's sa fety and security. n 
Proponents of the new regulations 
argue that terrorists and criminals 
could u e such technologies to 
keep their activities off investiga-
tors' radar. 

The new decis.ion to apply the 
Communications Assista nce for 
Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) 
of 1994 to Inrernet technolo-
gies cou ld be very costly indeed. 
CALEA dealt with telecommuni-
cations carriers, requiring 1;hem 
to design sy te rns to meet the 
wiretapping needs of law enforce-
ment officia ls per governmental 
sta ndards. 

The SOl1 Froncisco Chronicle 
reports that the new application 
of CALEA could cost universities 
"many millions of dollars in some 
cases." It is possible that the new 
regtdations could require universi-

ties to buy and install new switches 
and routers for their networks, 
an installation which could neces-
sitate the redesign of their net-
works to link dozens of buildings 
together. Conservative estimates 
say that this computer work could 
raise tuition costs as much as $450 
per student. 

But not only are these new 
regulations costly, they are unnec-
essary. Law enforcement agencies 
can already access the contents of 
VolP calls as long as they provide 
a subpoena. The mandate doesn 't 
provide the ability to access these 
calls; it only allows officials to 
morc easily capture the conver-
sation . Currently, official who 
wish to monitor someone at a 
university simply work together 
with campus officials [Q install the 
necessary survei llance equipment 
at specific rn ternet access sites. 

nder the new mandate. uni-
versities would be required to 
insta ll a network that would send 
all communications to a network 
operations center before allow-
ing them onto the Internet. 
This would essentia lly allow law 
enforcement officia ls to access the 
information easi ly from a remote 
location without having to set up 
individual wiretaps. 

University officials are all the 
more infuriated because it is rare 
for wiretaps to be placed in col-
lege networks in the first place. 
According to imide Higher Ed 

ews, of the hundreds of wire-
taps placed in 2003, only a dozen 
involved computer networks, and 
those dozen "would· cover not 
just those at colleges but those 
anyplace in the United States. It 
doesn't seem as if university net-
works are particularly a problem 
for law enforcement officials, so 
why bother with the new legisla-
tion?" 

Terry W . Hartle, the senior 
vice president for public and gov-
ernment affairs at the American 
Council of Education , agrees. 
"This is an awful lot of money for 
very little gain," he said. 

But there is more at stake than 
how the bill affects universities. 
It is highly possible that the FCC 

exceeded its statutory authority in 
expanding CALEA. When the bill 
was de bated in Congress the first 
time, many congressmen were 
nervous about what fell under its 
umbrella. One House report stat-
ed that CALEA's requirements 
did "not apply to information 
services such as e lectronic-ma il 
services; or online services; or to 
Internet service providers." The 
only ~ay the FCC was able to 
expand CALEA was to argue that 
the law's definition of 'telecom-
munications carrier' included such 
Internet technologies as broad-

band and VolP. 
This legal ground is so shaky 

that two of the four FCC commis-
sioners who voted for the exten-
sion aclmowledged that the FCC 
might have taken a "legal risk." 
Mark Rotenburg, director of the 
Electronic Privacy Information 
Center, said, "the FCC simply 
does not have the statutory author-
ity to extend the 1994 law for the 
telephone system to the 21 st cen-
tury lnternet." 

Essentia lly, the FCC has over-
stepped its authority. Not only is it 
requiring an already impoverished 

educational system to fund a man-
date that is entirely unnecessary, 
but they have made their decision 
on questionable legal grounds. 

If the mandate is not appealed, 
universities across the country will 
be forced to implement a very 
expensive new network system. 
But it is also possible that the door 
has been opened for future abuses 
of the law. Couldn't the FCC's 
argument for applying CALEA to 
VoIP also apply to other Internet 
applications? If recent appeals suc-
ceed, we should be hopeful that we 
won't find out. 

Fun-starved students get an extra hour - sort of 
Great 
Expectations 

Carol Freire 

T here i~ something terribly depressing about com-ing out of a midtenll at 
5 p.l11 . and stepping out into an 
alrc'ldy-dark afternoon. You just 
don't expect night to quite litcra lly 
fall faster than gnlVity in tile 50 
minutes vou' re in vVarren Lecture 
Iiall. It feels oddly like a prank, as 
if someone turncd off all the lights 
in the huuse whi le I was in the 
hathroom. You C~1I1 sec on campus 
that it makes all the studcnts who 
arc just barely dragging through 
the day lose that last flickering 
glimmer of motivation. 

nfortunately, that extra hour 
we ga ined over the weekend was tile 
last stand in staving-off easonal 
Affective Disorder. That's about all 
that hour is good for - symbolic 

cheer. Gaining an extra hour is 
a wonderful, if preposterous, illu-
sion. It is akin to gaining an extra 
pound: measurable, but you can't 
really tell where it went, and it's 
not really tha t useful. 

We all say wc wish we had 
more time. But that Little blip of 
nothing we borrow during fall 
only to return during spring is, in 
fact, extra time. Twenty-five hour 
days, although more in line with 
our circadian rhythms according 
to psychologists, aren't all thcy're 
cracked up to be. What did you do 
with th 'l t extra hour? 

At the risk of playing Captain 
Obvious, what we really wish for 
is more enjoyable time. You can: 
( I) save time and (2) enjoy the time 
you have. Go ahead and block off 
that afternoon for personal time. 
Do all the things you wish you did . 
Quit sch lwnping through campus 
and enjoy La Jolla . For example: 

• r lave a sunset picnic atop 
Mount oledad. 

• Learn to play ;in entire song 
on a new instrument. 

• Enjoy coffee in a sleepy ocean 
vista from the cove's Goldfish 
Point Cafe. 

• Regress back to a time before 
you were born and have ice cream 
at Ferrell's. 

• Bowl an entire game left-

~ I LEnERS TO THE EDITOR 
Sex offenders deserve 
harsher punishment 

Dear Editor, 
I read your editorial concem-

ing sex offenders and their "ban-
ishment" to modern-day leper 
colonies and chuckled. 

I chuckled because you obvi-
ously are not a parent. Since I am 
a parent of an II -year-old gi rl, 
1 ca n tell you that your concern 
for the well-being of sex offend-
ers will drastically change once 
you bring a child into this world . 
Once you realize that your child , 

" 1 can teU you that 
your concern for the 

weU,being of sex 
offenders tUiU

ld " tuor . 
- Michael May, Earl Warren 

College senior 
bc it a boy or a girl, is a possiblc 
target for these sick bastards, you 
will do anything - 071ything - to 
keep your child safe from preda-
tors. 

And considering the environ-
ment here in Cali fornia about 
executing people for heinous 
crimes - murder, rape, child 
molestation - the on ly alterna-
tive to taking all child molesters 
out of the gene pool with a 9mrn 
bullet in the skull is to isolate 

them in such a way that they will 
not be "tempted" by school-age 
children. If that means "leper 
colonies," then so be it. 

Putting a "Lo Jack" on them 
should be the least of their con-
cerns and since the so-called "pro-
gressives" here ill Ca lifornia can-
not condone permanently remov-
ing these pieces of filth from soci-
ety via execution, it's the minimum 
price they should pay for robbing a 
chi ld of its innocence.

Eucalyptus groves 
deserve more notice 

Dear Editor, 
I thought the ellcalypnls groves 

had ~reat meaning and symholism 
and usage for the univer ity, and 
that they add itionally represented 
an unused natural resource which 
could be utilized for bringing a 
new academic discipline to tile 
ca mpus of CSD, and also a few 
other Universiry of California 
campuses. In case the campus 
wasn 't aware, I have been operat-
ing a survey for the last month to 
determine the campus awarenes 
of the groves and [theirJ relation 
to a multigrants, multidiscipline 
program and project, in addition 
to the new agronomy club I am 
attempting to get off the ground 
here. 

What 1 have found is that no 
one on campus actually carcs at 
all what happens to the eucalyptus 
groves or about a multimillion dol-
lar new curriculum, department, 
lab faci li ties and many, many more 
jobs, or even of having a new 
campus club to support a new cur-
riculum. 

Are you thinking about a career in medicine, pharmacy, 
dentistry, optometry, or another health profession?

I have found that most who 
saw the several notices have no 
awareness of trees at all, much 
less the eucalyptus environment 
here at UCSD. Or they see 
agronomy and they say, "Hey, 
UCSD doesn't have any agrono-
my department or cou rses. Wllat 
good will that do me?" But we 
could havc uch a deparOl1cnt and 
course of rudy. 

That is what I am trying to 
stimulate, for the university and 
maybe for you or someone clse. 
There's no reason why CSD 
can't have agronomy. T he agron-
omy club community service cle-
ment was going to be amI still 
can be sound, hands-on training, 
which was hopefully to blossom 
into the Internship part of the 
submirted program, once the 
California Eucalyptus Program 
for Scholars got off the ground .

nless there is a better under-

be interested, it would appear 
that something very, very, good

OCTOBER 31. 2005 lHE UCSD GUARDIAN 

·SRTV: Broadcast within FCC rules, Tess says 
. continued from page J 

are. We are to make sure no student 
breaks FCC broadcast rules and 
regulations, which Steve York has 
not done." 

John Muir College Senior 
Senator Conrad Ohashi, who voted 
against the ban on pornography, 
said that, although he felt sympa-
thy for Pillon, the latest broadcast 
has not changed his mind on the 
broader issue. The same day of the 
second airing, the Muir College 
Council passed a resolution sup-
porting free speech on SRTv. 

"I view last Thursday as a politi-
cal statement, and political state-
ments should be honored as free-
dom of speech," Ohashi said. "J feel 
even more strongly now that this 
should go through the grievance 
process." 

Pillon herself expressed no 
desire to let Thursday'S airing alter 
her views in any way. 

"I believe strongly that I was 
attacked for standing up for what I 
believe in," she said. "I'm not going 
to stop doing thaL" 

Rather than inciting personal 
vendettas, the effect of Thursday'S 
broadcast may be the galvaniza-
tion of the council, according to 

acting Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Student Life Gary R. Ratcliff. 

The broadcast was aired as a 
political statement, and had no per-
sonal bearing, acccording to York.. 

"This was not a personal attack 
on Kate Pillon," he said. "She threw 
herself into this debate and made 
herself a figure for satire. Granted, 
it was done in a very low-blow way, 
but it got the point across." 

Tess said that he did not believe 
the legislation passed last week 
was in effect because it had yet 
to be signed by A.S. President 
Christopher Sweeten. Mcanwhile, 
York said the council did not have 
the vote necessary to install the 
nudity ban. 

"I am personally convinced that 
the amendment to the constitution 
required a two-thirds majority to 
pass, and they didn't have it," York 
said. "I would hope if A.S. has a 
problem with the content of the 
show, they would follow their own 
Media Grievance Procedure guide. 
Issues with content belong there, 
not on the council Ooor." 

York's decision to air his Oct. 
n broadcast was indicative of the 
Koala's unprofessional manner, 
Ratcliff said. 

"'Koala 1V' had an opportu-
nity to honor the intent of the A.S. 
Council and they chose not to," he 
said. "From what I've read, Steve 
York is characterizing it as civil 
disobedience, but they singled out 
a member of the council. r thought 
it was very cruel and hatefuL" 

The university will allow the 
A.S. Council to ultimately decide 
what course of action will be taken 
in this maner, Ratcliff said. 

"The university hasn't been pas-
sive," he said. "We've made resourc-
es like campus counsel available 
to [the council], but there haven't 
been any plans formulated to inter-
vene. This is a council maner." 

Pillon said that although per-
sonal legal action against York may 
be within her rights, she does not 
believe it to be the most productive 
way of dealing with the situation. 

"I don 't want to engage Steve 
York," Pillon said. "Fighting back 
is stooping to his level and gratify-
ing him. It's not what [want. We 
can tum this into a positive thing, 
as far as the community coming 
together."

from 600 to 2,000. 
Changing the GRE is a step 

toward accomplishing the goals 
set by several graduate school 
committees, which envisioned a 
test that could better gauge future 
graduate work., Ewing said. Some 
students that plan on taking the 
GRE next fall or later find the 
new test to be a better version. 

"I think the new GRE will be 
more beneficial because it will 
be testing actual knowledge that 
might predict future success rather 
than just how well a person takes a 
test," Thurgood Marshall College 
senior Ashley Torres said. 

Torres plans on taking the GRE 
next fall in prepara tion to pursue a 
graduate degree in sociology. 

Test equality is another fac-
tor that makes the impending 
GRE an improved test, according 
to Thurgood Marshall College 
junior Angela Diveley, who ho!>C!s 
to study psychology at the gradu-
ate level. 

On the other hand, the length-
ened exam and limited number 
of sittings makes the experience 
more stressful and less convenient, 
both students said. 

"But if a longer test time results 
in a more accurate test score, it 
will be worth the time," Diveley 
said . 

While a revised GRE will also 
require new ways of prepara-
tion, students shouldn't fear the 
changes, according to Wands. 
The Princeton Review is current-

Iy looking into new methods of 
training students to continue to 
help them excel on the exam. 

A new GRE doesn't present 
major obstacles, but is just a mat-
ter of adaptation, Torres said. 

"If you really want to go to grad 
school to pursue your goals, you're 
going to do what you have to do," 
Torres said. "It's just another one 
of life's inconveniences that we'll 
have to deal with." 

The new GRE is currendy 
undergoing field study until Nov. 
23 to determine final revisions. 
Test preparatory courses such as 
Princeton Review are creating 
new courses for the revised exam.

Muir surf shop rides the boarding 
breaks all the way to campus 

By KAnE WESTFALL 
Contributing Writer 

N estled beneath J ohn Muir Collegc's Sierra Summit, Muir Surf & Sporr is a 
modest stOre with a sma ll cache of 
surf and ska teboarding clluipmcnt 
m:lking the best out of its limited 
space. 

Behind the counter i owner 
Scon Lembach, who works eve n 
after closing time. From bui ld-
ing a display case and hanging 
posters to adding lighting in the 
dressing room, he works intensely 
to maintain an inviting ambia nce 
in the store. lie only stops to 
help students find products or 
conversc about swell forecasts or 
cond itions. 

The store may be sl11all but its 
owner's vision is not. A self-pro-
clai med sa lesman, Lcmbach exudes 
youthful energy and enthusiasm. 
li e is a man of big ideas who talks 
with eager eyes about fi.mlre pro-
motions and ideas for the store. 

lie opened the doors of Muir 
Surf & Sport 011 Sept. 17 as the 
first surf, skate and snow shop to 
appear on a co ll ege campus in the 
continenta l U.S., according to 
Lcmbach . 

Good timing is partly responsi-
ble for the launching of Lembach 's 
husiness venture. According to 
,\1uir Co llege Center Director 
Vince Manson, the SpOt that is 
now Muir Surf & Sport was once 
called Glacier Point, a quiet study 
lounge that students rarely u ed. 
A student survey fowld that the 
top requests for the pace included 
a barber/hair sa lon, a video store 
and a surf hop. 

The origina l attempt of a video 
store fai led. and with CSD's 

John Yao/ Guardian 
Surf's Up: Muir Surf & Sport, the onft surf shop near Blacks Beach makes an array of 
surf and skate gear readift available for the 6,500 students who live on campus. 
proximity to the beach and its nota-
ble surfing culture, the idea of a 
surf shop was tempting. The sheer 
number of UCSD's o n-campus 
population made the venture seem 
promising: O ut of UCS O's 30,000 
students, more than 6,500 snldenrs 
live on campus - many of whom 
have few transportation options. 
An on-ca mpus store gives sl1ldents 
an incentive to shop locally. 

"We've got 30,000 kids here, 
and we are offering the industry'S 
culture to a new culture that's never 
been touched before," Lembach 
said. 

Ccrtain students also appreciate 
the arriva l of surf culture and prod-
ucts to campus. UCSD su rf tcam 
co-captain Lorca Lueras noted that 
the shop's location on campus is 
convenient for students. 

In 1997, Sports Illustrated 
ranked UCSD the "Best School 
for urfing," stemmi ng from the 

university's proximity to Black's 
Be'lch, where 3n offshore canyon 
generates one of the world's most 
famous breaks. However, there has 
ncver been a surf shop closer than 
2.5 miles from the school. 

O n the west side of campus, 
Mui r Surf & Sport sits within 
wa lkin g distance of the world-
renowned beach. Because the 
nearest surf shop is 2.5 miles 
away, Muir Surf & Sport has a 
claim as the beach 's exclusive shop. 
Lembach plans to also target the 
nonstudent B lack's Beach su rfer 
by emphasizing that parking is 
usually free o n t he weekends in 

CSD parking lots. 
But, Muir Surf & Sporr is sti ll 

ai med mainly at students. A stu-
dent-designed logo has recently 
been crafted for the shop's prod-
uct line and will appea r o n appar-

Water polo beat Lions 9-7 with strong first quarter 

Swimming: Tritons to head

By ANGIE UN 
Associate sports Editor 

The o. 6 UCSD Tritons

on Oct. 29 with a 9-7 victory 
over No. II Loyola Marymount 
University. In a high-scoring game, 
the Tritons extended their overaU 
record to 21 -7 with their second 
win over the Lions this season. 

Very similar ro their first march-
up earlier in the year, the Tritons 
jumped out in from with a 4-0 
lead in the first quarter, with senior 
Brandon Borso leading the way 
by scoring twO of the first-quarter 
goals.

Women's volleyball 
claims home victory 
Courtney's 27 kills raise host Tritons 
over Wildcats after four-game battle 

By NICKY BUCHANAN 
Staff Writer 

The No. 17 Tritons stepped up 
their game last week, using their 
home-court advantage to notch two 
wins over Cal State Stanislaus on 
Oct. 28 and Chico State on Oct. 29. 

UCSD (IS-5 overall, 10-4 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association) cruised by the Warriors 
in straight sets, but needed four sets 
for the win over the Wildcats. 

"The saying for this week was 
MEP or 'ma.ke 'em play,'" said 
junior Nicole Courtney, who was 
the star player against Stanislaus 
with 27 kills, 15 digs and a .364 
hitting percentage. "We wanted to 
keep the pressure on them and focus 
on minimizing our errors instead of 
swinging blindly." 

The Tritons started off sluggish 
in the first game against Chico State 
and didn't wake up until the final 
minutes when they scorM seven of 
the last 10 points to win game one 
by a score of30-22. In game two, the 
closest of the afternoon, the Tritons 
barely hung on after pulling ahead, 
thanks to senior Laura Watkins' ace 
to close out the game, giving UCSD 
a 33-31 win. 

Game three mirrored game two, 
with both teams breathing down 
each other's necks until the last 
points. At 13-13, UCSD scored 
three points on consecutive Wildcat 
errors, before falling right back to 
an 18-18 tie, which was broken by 

the combined forces of Courtney 
and junior Brianna Koche. The duo 
carried UCSD to a 24-19 and ulti-
mately the 30-22 win, capped off 
by freshman Rebecca Bailey's game-
ending kill. 

"Passing is really effective," 
Koche said. "By nailing the ball right 
at our target it allows us to run lots 
of quid sets." 

The Tritons didn't just rely on 
passing for the win, according to 
Courtney. 

"Our aU-around play contributes 
to our wins," she said. "We have to 
be sharp in every area." 

The Tritons completed the vic-
tory in the founh game, finishing off 
the Wildcats 30-22. 

"We need to maintain the 
same aggression and minimize our 
errors," head coach Tom Black said. 
"Nicole Courtney was huge tonight 
and Rebec:ca Bailey gets better every 
time, but I'm waiting for all six to 
play really good at the same time. 
We're in the home strctch here so 
hopefully we'll get to see it." 

The girls have two more home 
games this week to show what 
they're made of. On Nov. 2, they 
will face Cal State Bakersfield, while 
Nov. 4 has them pitted against Cal 
State Los Angeles. 

UCSD freshman Kim Carpenter 
said she hopes for lots of suppott 
from fans. 

"I'm really pumped for the 
CSULA game," she said. "We lost 
to them last time, so it's payback."

By LAUREN KATO

The home-field advantage was 
not enough to boost the UCSD 
men's and women's swimming 
and diving teams as both teams 
dropped matches to the University 
of Utah on Oct. 29 at Canyonview 
Pool. 

The loss was the first of the

of whom took first place in their 
ind ividual events. 

Tourtellottc, who set a CSD

freesty le on Oct. 15 , won in the

who won All-American honors for 
his performance la st year, finished 
in 59. 13 seconds, the faste t in the 
100 breaststroke race. 

Hsiao al 0 set an earlier record 
at this year's Blue vs. Gold meet 
in th e 50 fly. 

Marin joined the others in vic-
tory, winning the 100 backstroke 
in 52.03 seconds. 

Baier, who broke the UCSD 
300 individual medley record 
earlier this month and last year 

was All -American in two events, 
claimed the top spot in the 400 
individual medley, with a time of 
4:09.18. 

In the 200 medley relay, the 
team of Hsiao, freshman Steven 
Hardy, junior Lars ordstrom 
and senior Bernabe Sclafani tied 
for first with a finish of 1:34.91. 

The Triton men added to their 
score with a 6rst-place finish in 
the 400 freestyle relay. Freshman 
Artur Kubalski, juniors Nordstrom 
and Tim Fuller and senior Woody 
Hooten raced to victory with a 
time of 3:09.54. 

The UCSD women's team also 
won a total of six races but was 
defeated with a score of 116-ISO. 
Junior Emily Harlan had a trong 
day, winning both of her sprint 
events. 

Co-captain [farlan, who had a 
record-breaking season last year, 
finished in 24.34 seconds in the 
50 freestyle and in 53 .27 seconds 
in the 100 freestyle. 

Harlan 's 100 time broke her 
old record of 53.47, set earlier 
this month. 

Freshman Kendall Bohn also 
won two events, swimming to vic-
tory in the 100 backstroke with a 
time of I :06.S3. 

In the 200 breaststroke, Bohn 
flew past the competition with a 
finish of 2:20.75, almost five sec-
onds faster than the second-place 
finisher.

The UCSD's women's soccer 
team followed an impressive 3-0 
win over Cal State San Bernardino 
on Oct. 26 with a 2-0 win in the 
Tritons' finale against Cal State Los 
Angeles on Oct. 29. After clinch-
iJ1g their sixth-straight California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
South Division title in the game 
against the Coyotes, the Tritons 
used their final win to earn the 
No. 2 seed in the upcoming CCAA 
Conference Championships to 
begin on Nov. 4. 

The Tritons came into the game 
against Cal State San Bernardino 
realizing the importance of the 
contest. 

"It was a must-win game after 
our Cal State Dominguez Hills 
loss, which could have upset our 
chances at regionals but didn't," 
head coach Brian McManus said. 

It was not until the 64th minute 
that the Tritons got on the board. 
Junior Alise Malley knocked in her 
sixth goa I of the season off an assist 
from freshman Natasha Belak-
Berger to break the deadlock. 

"We switched the players in 
order to keep our statters relaxed 
and we really stepped it up," 
McManus said. 

Junior leading scorer Megan 
Dickey shoved in the second goal 
three minute~ after Malley's goal, 
again with a Belak-Berger assist. 

The goal was Didey's II th of 
the season. Only two minutes later, 
freshman Kelly Mayo 6nished off 
the scoring.

Dickey. After that point, the Tritons 
easily wielded off any attempts by 
the Coyotes to penetrate their air-
tight defense. 

"We had a very good defense 
that enabled us to stan attacking," 
McManus said. 

Freshmen goalkeepers Mia 
Shirley and Jessica McGovern shut 
down the Coyotes, who finished 
the season going scoreless in their 
last five matches. 

Cal State San Bernardino was 
limited to only seven shots in the 
9O-rninute contest, leaving two 
shots apiece for the goalies to save. 

"We had no real superstars in 
this game, we were just really solid 

all around," McManus said. 
Standing in last place in the 

CCAA South Division, the Coyotes 
finished the season a disappointing 
5-12-2 overall and 3-10-1 in league 
play. 

It is the fewest wins by a Cal 
State San Bernardino women's soc-
cer team since the program was 
staned in 1988. 

The Tritons beat Cal State 
Los Angeles 2-0 on senior night at 
home on Oct. 29. The team played 
following the brief ceremony to 
honor seniors Heather Szafraniec 
and Kristina De La Rosa. 

The 2-0 finale closed out the 
2005 season in which UCSD went 
15-3-0 overall and 11 -3-0 in CCAA
