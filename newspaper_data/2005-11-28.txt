House rejects bill to 
freeze 'Pell 'Grants 
By ERIKA CERVANTES 

Staff Writer 

T he U.S. House of 
Representatives rejected a compro-
mi e pending bill that would have 
blocked future Pell Grant increas- · 
e . T he 224-209 vote on ov. 17 
included unanimous Democratic 
oppo ition , which was bolstered 
by votes from 22 Republicans and 
one lndependent. 

Coll ege groups opposed the 
bi ll specifically because it would 
have kept federal Pell Grants at a 
maximum $4,050 per student, 3n 
amount that has remained stag-
nant despite inflation and tuition 
increases, according to Rep. Steny 
l1. I l oyer (D - Md.). 

T he bi ll would also have kept 
financi~1 aid programs at their 
2005 levels.

Federal loans a-,ain 
on chopping block 

By CHARLES NGUYEN 
News Editor 

After ' turning down legisla-
tion that would have stunted Pell 
G rant growth, the U.S. House of 
Representatives proceeded to cut 
student aid, passing a bi ll that reduc-
es funding of federal student loans 
by $14.3 billion. 

The downsizing is part of a "bud-
get reconciliation" process to reduce 
the federal deficit by $50 billion. 
In the report, the Congressional 
Budget Office concluded that the 
bill would force a change in interest 
rates on student loans, which would 
inflate student borrowing costs by 
$5.5 billion. 

The bill, passed by a narrow 
2 17 -2 15 vote, will move into a con-
ference committee with the Senate, 
which approved a version of the bi ll 
that also includes a $15 billion curto 
student- loan programs. In addition, 
the Senate bill establishes grant pro-
grams that cou ld benefit tudents 
from disadvantaged backgrounds. 

The House passage dealt a blow 
to college advocacy groups, which 

have been lobbying politicians to 
stand against the cuts. The nited 
States Student Association spear-
headed a nationwide cru ade against 
what it dubbed a "raid on sutdent 
aid." 

.. tudents intend to make 
Congress aware that budget rec-
onciliation threatens the future of 
our generation and the livelihood of 
o ur country," US A Board Member 

'hley Rees stated in a press re lease. 
"We are opti mistic thaI we ca n 
defeat the final budget reconcilia-
tion bill , even if it means we must 
make ca lls during finals week and 
our winter vacation. " 

Both Chancellor Maryc Anne 
Fox and AS. President C hristopher 
Sweeten have sided wi th the cam-
paign, and spoke out on ov. I 
against cutting higher education 
loan financing. 

"This is a very important chal-
lenge we are facing," Fox said. "Any 
effort that shi fts the responsibili ty 
from the federa l government to the 
backs of students is not a prudent

Task force to redefine 
SRTV purpose, charter 

Following the appointment of 
AS. councilmembers to the Student-
Run Television Ad Hoc Task Force, 
the group will meet to rewrite the 
station's charter in order to craft a 
management hierarchy, identify roles 
and define the purpose of the sta-
tion, according to Thurgood Marshall 
Student College Council Chair and 
appointed task force member Denis 
Shmidt 

'One of the main things I want to 
accomplish out of all I)f this is darity; 
I would like anyone to be able to 
read the charter and know exactly 
where AS stands, what the rules are 
and what the hierarchy IS: Shmidt 
stated in an e-maiL "The current 
charter is far too vague, has far too 
many discrepancies and does not 
clearly show who is accountable for 
preserving and enforcing the rules of 
the station:' 

The task force has not yet con-
vened, but hopes to at least once 
before the end of the quarter, 
according to Revelle College Senior 
Senator Rachel Corell, another task 
force member. 

Report: Federal funds 
for science slipping 
Data released from the National 

Science Foundation suggest that 
federal money for scientifiC research 
has been shrinking in recent years. 

The foundation's report esti-
mates that, while research funding 
in 2005 will increase a half percent 
over last year, adjusting for inflation 
since 2000 still puts federal fund-
ing 1.5 percent below the 2004 
level. The NSF projected that total 
federal sCience research funding 
would be $54.7 billion in 2005. 

The numbers released by the 
NSF also showed varying federal 
support levels for different agen-
Cies and Indicated that while the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services, the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration and 
the NSF received funding hikes In 
2005, research funding declined 
for Ihe Departments of Agriculture, 
Defense and Energy. 

However, when adjusted for 
Inflation since 2000, all agen-
Cies showed a decline In federal 
research funding after, except the 
NSF. 

The NSF also reported that, in 
2005, total federal funding of all 
research and development as well 

as R&D facilities will amount to $110 
billion. 

Ericsson backs new 
UCSD position 

Telecommunications company' 
Ericsson has endowed a new UCSD 
chair of wireless communication 
access techniques, which will be 
filled by Jacobs School of Engineering 
professor laurence Milstein. 

Milstein, a faculty member of 
almost three decades, will serve ai 
chair through UCSD's new CaI-~I1) 
division, which has a corporate part-
nership with Ericsson. Milstein, a 
specialist in digital communication 
theory, usually advises up to 20 
graduate students as well as some 
candidates for maste~s degrees. 

Milstein served as prinCipal inves-
tigator on another Ericsson-funded 
venture. The code division multiple 
access systems ~search project. run 
through CaI-(I1) since 2002, was 
also backed by a grant provided by 
the UC Discovery program. With 
the research, Milstein hopes to lead 
developments in the area of COMA, 
which is used in mobile telecom-
munications. 

Anti-depressant key 
in meth use therapy 

UCLA researchers have begun 
human testing on a potential treat-
ment for methamphetamine addic-
tion by using an anti~epressant 
Currently, no medications are feder-
ally sanctioned to treat meth addicts. 
The anti-depressan~ called bupro-
pion, curbs the "high" created by 
meth as well as the desire to use the 
drug. UCLA Semel Institute research-
ers stated in the online journal 
Neuropsychopharmaco/ogy. 

The researchers stated in the 
report that bupropion diminishes 
the effects of meth by blocking its 
way Into brain cells, where the drug 
expedites the release of neurotrans-
mitters that give the user feelings of 
euphona. The study, the fi rst to use 
the antl~epressant in human meth 

treatmen~ IS in its second phase of a 
dlnlcal trial. Currently, 20 of 26 clini-
cal participants have completed test-
Ing. All participants, active meth users 
between the ages of 18 and 45, 
randomly received either a placebo 
or the anti-depressant while taking 
meth doses intravenously. Subjects 
taking the antidepressant said that 
they experienced both weaker highs 
and cravings after treatment the 
researchers found.

Other ' college organizations are 
ga lvanizing in opposition to the 
cuts. The California Public Interest 
Research Group has launched "stu-
dent debt alett." a campaign that 
aims to publicize a platfoml of 
srudent-aid refonn . Other groups, 
such as the Student Aid Alliance, 
are organizing similar effons. 

"\Vhenever the student aid pro-
grams produce savings, Congress 
takes them to spend on other areas 
of government, whether deficit 
reduction, hurricane relief or othcr 
ed ucation and health programs," 

SAA co-Chairs David Ward and 
David Warren stated in a letter to 
Congress. "Congress must stop the 
mid on student aid!" . 

However, the move to green-
light the cut emphasizes fiscal 
responsibility, said some of the bill's 
supporters. 

"[The] vote is an investment 
in America's future," Rep. Duncan 
Hunter (R-Calif.) stated in a press

steps toward reducing the deficit,

Pell: Buying power of grant fell in past years 
conr.in~d from page I 

ing for the federal grant has fallen 
far behind other aid programs, 
according to UCSD Director of 
Financial Aid Vincent De Anda . 

"The Pel! Grants have lost 
substantial ground in real dollars 
over the last six years," De Anda 
said. "Federal PelJ Grants are the 
weakest link in the triumvirate 
of grant programs that [ use to 
fund our students. Cal Grants and 
university grants have increased 
considerably every year, as fees 
increase, while Pell Grants have 
steadily decreased in real dollars." 

A budget outline passed by the 
House Appropriations Committee 
in June would have increased the 
Pell Grant maximum to $4,100, 
but the final spending bill, draft-
ed by a conference committee 
between the House and Senate, 
opted for keeping the maximum at 
the same level as years before. 

The decision to not increase 
grant funding makes access to 
higher education increasingly dif-
ficult for some students, according 
to De Anda . 

"In my opinion, there appears 
to be a constant, measured with-
drawal at the federal level from 
funding student financial aid," De 
Anda said. "If the feds did their 
part in increasing Pell Grants, 

students would not have to bor-
row and work as Illuch ." 

Republican opposition to the 
bill was largely due to a $1 billion 
cut to pork-barrel initiatives, as 
well as fierce lobbying from col-
lege groups that oppose a cut to 
student loans that was passed by 
the House (see story on page I). 

" If tlle feds did their 
part in increasing 

PeU Grants, students 
would not have 

to barrow and work 
as much." 

- VIncent De Anda. 
~ UCSD office of 

fiMncilllid 

It is unclear how the vote deci-
sion will affect college students and 
whether legislation that follows 
will alJocate more funds to higher 
education. Though the future of 
the Pell Grant program remains 
unknown, Democrats celebrated

th e rejection of the bill as a "tre_ 
mendous defeat" for Republicans, 
according to the minority leader 
Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). 

"It was defeated because it had 
the wrong priorities and did not 
address the needs of the American 
people," Pelosi stated in a press 
release. "This bill cut our federal 
investment in education, it aban-
doned job training programs and 
it fails our public hea lth system.

ha>ed on a random sample of about 250 
fClllal e ~md male pastors from a r.lI1gc of 
denominations. It i important to note that 
men's and wOlnen's varying styles can com-
plement rather than excl ude each other. As 
in a marriage, both can help provide balanced 
leadership - the best of both worlds as a 
working, constructive lmit. 

Ilowever, every person is an individual in 
their own right, and it is crucial to remember 
that no gender can completely be represented 
by one mode of though r. Just as not every 
woman is "loving, nurturing and ca ring" -
the generali7A1tions fo mled by some pastors 
of the study - not every man is necessarily 
stronger, morc opinionated and decisive. 

Sometimes it's surprising to recall that 
women's suffrage has only been in effect for a 
li ttle over 80 years. But before women were 
allowed to vote, activisr Victoria Woodhull 
stepped forWard as th e first woman presi-
dentia l candidate in 1872 against Ulysses 
Grant, and though the surge of fire that 
prompted the women's suffrage movement 
has since receded, women have surfaced for 
consideration within the past few decades. 
Ilopefu ls such as Elizabeth Dole, Patricia 
Shroeder and Geraldine Ferraro broke male-
domi nated barriers, committee and position-
wise, appearing on ly within the last 20 years. 

nfortunately, this is already old news for 
colin tries around the world.

"the first

cial position, Edith Wilson was able to read 
all documents en 1Vllfe to the president and 
become his most influential advisor. She is not 
the first nor thc last woman to have claimed 
:I se3t of power from the shadows. Although 
a woman has yet to acheivc the ultimate seat 
of power, that in no way implies that women 
have been completely absent from positions 
of leadership. 

Cennlries of patriarchal familial systems 
have led Americans to become accustomed 
to male bread\\"inners, protectors and heroes, 
even if such attitudes arc only subconscious 
today. The strange duality of dIe matter is 
that women are required to care and teach 

for thl! future leaders of the world, but never

A poll 
co ndu c t ed 
by USA 
Today and 

By YASHA SHARMA 
Staff Writer 

CNN last month indicated that 8t percent 
of people think that they arc willing to vote 
for a female candidate, bur 34 percent think 
their neighbo rs would not vote for a fcmal e 
candidate. Bec.lUse many try to respond 
in the most politica lly correct manner, it 
is highly unlikely that all are te lling the 
truth . 

bour 67 percent of those poll ed sa id 
3 female president would be better than a 
male on domestic i~sues, but only 24 percent 
sa id a woman president would do better on 
fo rcign policy issues. So it is ironic that

Thatcher, one of the United Kingdom 's 
greatest leaders, pushed for conflict and

terous, 
expecting the same mindset from dl C nation 
is fooli h. Convincing most Americans to 
believe this idea is preposterous is a task 
that will be long in the making. 

In any election, a male candidate will be 
considered for his competency and respect-
ability. For a female, unfortunatel y, the first 
thought that comes to the mind of an aver-
age voter is that he is a woman. There will 
be some wbo dismi ss the idea of voting for 
a femal e candidate si mpl y because of her 
gender, and not because they consider her 
any less competent than the other ca ndi-
date. As a result, any female candidate will 
start an election at a serio us disad.antage. 

It's also worth noting that while 5 1 
pe rcent of th e American population is 
female, Congress is only 15 percent fema le. 
Geraldine ~rraro ran for vice president in 
1984, but in the twO decadcs since then, no 
woman has been nominated to a presid en-
tial ticket - or even seriously co mpeted for 
a nomination. Ten of the 86 male enators 
have ·taken steps toward 2008 presidential 
campaigns· Sen. J l illary Clinton (D - .Y.) 
is the only of the 14 female se nators posi-
tioned to run . Six of the nation's 42 male 
governors have sa id they may run; none of 
the eight female governors have. 

It is clear that even those women who 
may have achieved the kind of status that 
is required to run for presidcnt often do 
not take the necessary measures towa rd a 
presidential campaign. Perhaps it is tradi -
tion that prevents women from contem-
p lating such. a position, or perhaps it is 
just taken for granted that the presidential 
post belongs to a man. In either case, it is 
certain that female politicians are not as 
incli ned to run for presiden t, even in situ-
ations where they have as much experience 
as men. It is all unfortunate reaUty that 
such a discouraging envi ron ment exists for 
American fema le poUticians, but it is a real-
ity nonetheless. 

W hen in 1960 Si rivamo Bandara naike 
of Sri Lanka becamc the world's first 
fem ale prime minister, it was said that the 
United States, as the world's most impor-
tan t democracy, would soon fo llow suit by 
electing a woman president. Similar predic-
tions fo llowed Isabe l Peron 's ascension to 

. the presidency of Argentina in 1974, yet 
both major American political parties have 
continued to nominate males. Women have 
taken positions of power in such supposedly 
backwards countries as the Philippines, 
Bangladesh and Mozambique. 

Recently, E llcn Johnson-SirIeaf claimed 
victory as the first woman elected president 
of an African nation (Liheria). Angela 
Merkel has become the first female chan-
cellor of Germany. But regard less of how 
good they may be at their jobs, neidler of 
these women has ever governed a super-
power. 

Anl erica n voters feel as though they arc 
voting for the leader of the free world, and 
they are. Perhaps this is why a woman can-
didate is unlikely to be allowed a fair chance.

Women: Female politicians 
are now leading the pack 

continued from page 4 
too long ago, in the era of physical 
roiling and labor, women worked 
beside their husbands in the fields 
before rushing home to cook meals 
without thc aid of refrigeration, elec-
tricity or supermarkets. They were 
able and imporrant, and re pected 
for it. While the United Srates has 
left the agriculnlral society almost 
com pletely behind, women arc sti ll 
industrious. Their jobs si mply go 
largely unrecognized and their back-
bone dismissed , even as women begin 
to reUlrI1 to the work force. Even if 
women arc numlrers, it takes guts to 
em away the g:l1lgrene. 

ecording" to a recent inter-
view of the CW\\,L, igdb 
Finnhogadottir said th~lt when she 
had been pre ident of Iceland for 
eight yea r~, children of that age had 
assumed that o nly women could 
be presidents. Media influences, 
such as "Com mand er in Chief," 
a new television drama ahout the 
first' female .S. president, and 
even ources like " tar Trek," 
which stars women as captains and 
leaders, show that mericans have 
become accllsromed to the concept 
of a female leader. 

T he polls agree. Sta ti slics taken 
by ll carst Newspapers/Siena 
College Poll show that 62 percent 
of merican believe the)' arc ready 
for a female president in 200tl, and 
8 1 percent would vote for a female 
president. The W BC/Marist 
poll suggest~ that the wording of 
a national poll and analy~is of sub-
groups can yield more compre-
hcnsive answers. For instance, age 
plays a factor: People under the age 
of 45 tend to suppo rt the idea of a 
fema le president more than oldcr 
America ns o f both genders. 

IIowever, the most compelling 
evidcnce for the probahility of a 

woman in office is a poll taken of 
a wide range of Democrats and 
Republicans, with both partjes 
voting for prospective candjdates 
respectively for the 2008 prima-
ry election. Interestingly, when 
Democrats were asked to give their 
preference for a presidcnt from 
a list of choices, I fill ary Clinton 
led the pack with appro)(imately 
40 percent, a large lead over male 
peers John Kerry (18 percent), 
J o hn Edwards ( 16 percent) and 
odle r Dcmocrnti c hopefuls. A large 
majority of D emocrat (74 percent) 
a lso supported Clinton sho uld she 
enter the race. O n the Republican 

~ide, a similar listing of Republican 
hopefuls found that Ri ce tied, at 2 1 
percent, with Rudy Giuliani at the 
top of the po ll , followed closely 
by John Mc ain, Jeb Bu h, I ewt 
Gingrich and o th ers. In both lists, 
women were leaders in the poll , 
despite the overwhelming pres-
ence of male politici'lIls. Women , 
as indi vidual, can stand out in a 
crowd without assistance. 

Considering th e histOry of wom-
en's rights in the nited States and 
the hjghly va ried status of wo men 
worldwide, it shouldn 't come as 
a surprise that W0111en themselves 
may be uncomfortable with the 
idea of putti ng themselves in the 
spotlight. Countlcs~ female lead -
ers have professed ,I desire to stay 
where they are as le;lderl;, governors 
and senators of their own srates and 
pass up a presidential ticket. I':ven 
abroad, fc mal e leaders exp ress dis-
comfort \I hile in office due to over-
whelming criticism and scrutin y, 
which they feel is not pre ent for 
male leaders. But the nited rates 
Illust move ahead in time, and with 
female candida tes currently leading 
tile pack, the present is as good a 
time as any. 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

N I LEnERS TO THE EDITOR 
Important events at 

UCSD overlooked 
Dear Edito r, 

We are writing to express our 
dissatisfaction with the Gll11rdinll ~r 
lack of coverage of Thurgood 
MarshaU Week. 

One newsworthy event y~ur 
newspaper fail ed to cover was 
Cheryl Brown I lenderson speak-
ing to hundreds of UCSD students 
about educational inequality, her 
role in the landmark ClIse B1Tl11.'n v. 
BOfird of EtiIlClIlioll and her personal 
interactions with the late Thurgood 
Marshall. Another event was the 
fourtll annual MarshallpalooZ<1, a 
free (:ll mival and conceIT that rhe 
GlI(wditlll also overlooked. 

Thurgood Marshall ' Week's 
purpose i not only to celebrate 
the essence of our college but· also 
to huild communi ty and school 
pride . The student satisfa ction 
report srates that there is a need 
for traditions on thi s campus, yet 
the Gllnrdi(lII has chosen to ignore 
the efforts of many smdent leaders 
who are trying to esrablish these 
trJrutions. 

Furthermore, we do not 
understand your ob ession with 
the 'ldministration. \Ve are sure 
that students picking up the Nov. 
2 1 iss ue of the GllfJrdi(JII were 
much more i"ntercsted in reading 
about a free concen than being 
given an update on the status of 
C hancellor Fox's future hou se. 
Certain ly a pictu re of a Ferri, 
wheel full of C D students or a 
close-up of one particu lar ~tl1dem 

getting bucked off a mechanical 
bu ll is more eye-catching than 
acting Assistant Vice Chancellor 
of Student Life Gary Ratcliff sit-
ting behind his desk. 

Articles about events that have 
already happened persuade stu -
dents to attend simjlar cvents in 
the future. The GllflJrlill11 should 
also utilize the 1 lianls section to 
preview upcoming festiV:lls' musi-
cal acts. Your newsp3llCr's lack of 
coverage of actual CSD events is 
absurd and we urge you to recon-
sider the G(I/wdi(/I/:" journalistic

Outreach resources such as clubs 
and orientations should focus on 
increasing engagement to curb the 
concerning levels of dissatisfaction 
among transfer students, Kinzie 
said. 

"ERC has so many [general] 
requirements that I have to we care 
of first," Kraisornkowit said. "But 
if] were at Muir or Marshall, I'd 
take advantage of it because I'd have 
more time." 

Otherwise, Kraisornkowit is satis-
fied with UCSD, and disagreed with 
the study's findings that transferring 
schools makes college involvement 
more difficult. 

Lau said that events for transfer 
students were an efft:ctive way to 
socia/ize, while Huang found ori-
entation the most helpful because 
it showed students the locations of 
buildings o n campus.

"The pattern of results shows 

that transfers are less engaged across 
some important areas of effective 
educational practices '" related to 
high levels of learning and person-
al development," SSE Director 
George Kuh said. 

Kuh also said that college may 
benefit transfer students less than 
other students. 

"I t's hard to know for sure Iwhy 
the results are the way they are) 
and nor all transfer srudents are less 
engaged," Kuh said. 

Overall , transfers have fewer 
enriching experiences, such as study-
ing abroad, mostly because it has to 
be planned in advance, Kuh said. 

The disruption caused by trans-
ferring to a different environment 
may prevent a srudent from being 
involved in meaningful ways, the 
study reported. 

" I don't want to srudy abroad yet 
because I want to know the campus 
better," said I-luang, a transfer from 
De Anza College in San Jose. 

Although he is sa tisfied with 
CSD, I luang said he finds it dif-

ficult to build relationships with pro-
fessors. 

" I had great relation hips with 
instructors at De Anza," I luang said. 
" ow that I've left I have to find 
new faculty members to build rela-
tionships with. It's like starti ng over 
and I'm only going to be here for 
[wo more years." 

For Kraisornkowit, who first 
attended 'UC Riverside and then 

"J feel more accepted here than 

" Now that I've left [De Anzal I have W find

at DC Riverside and Mount SAC: 
he said . "At CSD, I thought of it as

Sixth College jWlior Shuli Lau 
said she thinks that transfer students 
am be more involved if they try. 

"If you put yourself to it you 
won't miss out on things," she said. 
"It just takes some time. Compared 
to freshmen, we have to do it on our 
own. We're trying to ger used to a

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK 

MONDAY, N VEMflER 28, 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 8 

EDUCATION'S NEw FRONTIER 
By.VLADIMIR KOGAN 

Senior Staff Writer 
As the global economy evolves, students an,d their 

professors quickly emerge as the n'ew 'creative class' 
experts predict will drive the future of America 

I n 1993, Michael Doyle did not set out to fun -damentally change the then-infant Internet. Instead , the UC San Francisco biology researcher was working withthrec-dimension-al images of die heart, images he wanted to 
share with colleagues. So Doyle tinkered with some 
computer code, birthing the technology responsibl e 
for the first interactive Web pages - a technology 
now ubiquitous in Web browsers and es ential to t he 
Internet. 

By 1998, the Univer ity of CalifornIa had secured 
a patent for the technology 'and licensed it to a com-
pany run by Doyle. Shortly thereafter, both the uni -
versity and (he re earcher filed suit against Microsoft, 
alleging that the software giant'S I nternct Explorer 
violated Doyle'S patent; last year, a jury agreed, giv-
ing the UC system and Doyle 's firm more than $S20 
million in damages - an amount equal to almost a 
fifth of the tOtal funds the state of California gives 
to UC campuses each year. Though the controversy 
is sti ll making its ways through the courts, the .S. 
Patent and Trademark Office reaffirmed Doyle 's pat-
em earlier thi s fall. 

Perhaps like few other inventions, Doyle's dis-
covery is emblematic of the changes at American 
universities that has accompanied the arrival of the 
high-tech information economy. More and more, th e 
husiness of universities is becoming less "teaching," 
and more "inventing." 

"U niversities provide an effective vehicle for trans-
ferring cutting-edge technology from the lab to th e 
manufacturing floor," said Mathew M. ordan, vice 

of research at Lux Resea rch, a nanotechnol -
consultancy, during testimony in Congress thi s 

Half a century ago, college wa s 
••• ~, • . _ -, viewed as the place 

to trajn students to 

become effective members 'of the worl.force. But at 
the beginning of a new millennium, the mission of 
universities is changing. Some policy experts predict 
that it is creative capital , not traditional economic 
compararive advantages, that will provide th e basis of 
fi.mlre economic growth in America. . 

"Where once we optimized our organizations for 
efficiency and quality, now we must optimize our 
entire society for innovation," stated the Cou ncil 
on Competitiveness, a group made up of business, 
union and academic leaders, in a 2004 report on the 
American economy. 

With newly emerging economics in Indi a and 
China, both of which produce highly skilled work-
ers who arc willing to work for low wages, eco nomic 
expert argue that America 's future will not be based 
on traditional "factors of production" - things like 
higher quality of the workforce or lower costs. On 
these axes , it simply cannot rcmain competitive. 
Instead , they believe that the United States can retain 
its economic dominance by tapping into its uniqu e 
culture of high-growth entrepreneurship, compcting 
in the field of new and robust ideas. 

In the words of the Council on Competitiveness, 
America must "innovate or abdicate." 

And entrepreneurship advocates, including tthe 
Ewing Marion Kauffman Fou ndation , believe that 
universities will be central to incubating innovation. 
In particu lar, they focus on a process known as "tech-
nology transfcr" - the way new ideas generated by 
academics enter the marketplace, in much the same 
way that Doyle's novel invention wa transformed for 
wider app lication . 

"The capitalization of knowledge represents a 
transformation of the role of the university in soci-
ety comparable to the first academic revolution of

·U.CSD students give their two cents on porn fiasco at York Hall 
By ALU STlATFOLD-YOUNG 

Contributing Writer 

P ornography isn't typica lly discussed in polite conver-sation, but its recent air-
ing on Student-Run Television 
has inspired a wide range of reac-
tions among sUldents - from mild 
amusement to indifference to com-
plete disgust. 

"Porn ation," a presentation 
on pornography held in York Hall 
on ov. 21 followed the airings of 
pornography that put UCSD in 
the national spotlight. The event, 
hosted by the Ca mpus Crusade for 
Christ, was intended to rai se social 
awareness about sexual culture in 
our society. 

Fonner self-described porn and 
sex addict Michael Leahy spoke to a 
crowd that nearly filled up the seats 
in York I lall 2722. As the event's 
title suggested, the main message 
was that our nation is turning into 
an overly sexual culture, supported 
by Leahy's own experience and a 
brief 61m that presented facts and 
interviews about pornography. 

Leahy presented his Story hon -
estly and with little emotion. l Ie 
described his first viewing of por-
nography at the age of II and how 
that first viewing \I"as what devel-
oped his addiction, 'thich eventually 

ruined his IS-yea r marriage. 
After his wi fe and children left 

him because t hey couldn't deal 
with his add iction and the affair 
he'd been having, Lea hy said that 
h is wife's brother ca lled h im and 
told him to find God . He devel-
oped a stro ng fai th in C hristianity, 
which helped him recover. 

T he event attracted a number 
of students who have an opinion 
on pornography and were anything 
but passive, even though some had 
not seen the ai ring on SRTV. 

Some students thought that por-
nography should be available for 
those who seek to view it in private, 
while others thought that pornog-
raphy and all graphjc images associ-
ated with it should be completely 
banned from SRTV, more specifi-
cally. 

"The school should regulate it," 
said Bora Park, a Sixth College 
freshman. " I think we're toO young 
to be exposed to that kind of 
media." 

Park noted that regular TV 
channels make an effort to censor 
nudity and added that the pornog-
raphy aired on RTV was a waste 
of mone),. 

"They use the moncy I pay to 
air this show," she said. 

Eleanor Roosevelt College 
senior Ryan Dooley said that th e 

pornography airings were in bad 
taste, but added that the 'school 
doesn't have the right to remove 
the show. 

D arrell Carbaja l, a , Revelle 
College senior, shared a similar 
opinion, but noted that he hadn't 
rea lly thought about it beca use he 
doe n't watch SRTV. Students liv-
in g off-campus are not connected to 
the UCSD closed-circuit network, 
caus ing much of their opinion to be 
limited to public pornography. 

"(believe it's immoral, but should 
it be legal?" Carbajal said. 

Sixth College senior Katie 
Renock said that she hadn't given it 
much thought either. 

"If I saw it, J wou ld probably be 
disgusted," she sa id. 

Renock also commented on tile 
second porn airing on SRTV, where 
the face of Thurgood Marshall 
College Senior Senator Kate Pi ll on 
was superimposed on the body of 
the original adult film actress. 

" I fee l for her, because her repu-
tation was attacked and she ha s to 
redecm herself," Renock said. 
. Park also -aid that what hap-

pened to Pillon was in bad taste. 
"People say it's OK because 

people know her, but r don 't think 
that's right," she said. "I think she

Commercialization of new ideas 
has also provcn to be a profitable 
business for univcrsities, and not 
just in the form of licensing fees 
they reccive from new technolo-
gies. Since 1980, the government 
has givcn universities billions of 
dollars in rcscHch grants with few 
strings attached, monies that do 
not need to be paid back. 

For example, about :J third of 
l)CSJ)'s record 1.9 billion in 
revenue in 2004 came from grants 
and comracts. It received les than 
halfofthat amount from Californi.l 
ta~paycrs and tudenr fees.

their brethren's role in promoting 
research and profits.

L. Doolittle in a 2003 interview 
with the fill Diego UlIiOIl-Tribllllr. 
"Therc's a neglect of dut), whcn 
faculty pay so much arrention to 
their companie~, rather than their 
undergraduate teaching." 

For_ now, those who share 
Doo littl c's fear remain in the 
minority. 

'Flight of the creative class' 

I n late july, top academics and policy experts met in a luxuri-ous conference room on the 
top floor of the Dirksen Senate 
office building in Washi ngton, 
D.C. Few, howevcr, were there 
for the free food and booze. 

The event was a forum on 
innovation, hosted by johns 
llopkins nivcrsiry, mer i ca'~ 
first rescarch university (found-
ed in 1876) and the top national 
recipient of federal funding. But 
the 'llmosphere was anything but 
cheerful, acknowledged Johns 

Il opkill~ niversity Pre idem 
\Vill iam R. Brody, who moderated 
th e discus~ions. 

"The legacy America bequeaths 
to its chi ldren will depend on the 
creativity and commitmcnt of our 
nation to build a new era of pros-
perity at horne and abroad," Brody 
told Congres earlier that month. 
"The generation of new knowl-
cdge through research, and the 
transmis ion of existing knowl-
edge in a world-Icading education 
system are the two cssential elc-
ments of a productive and innova-
tive society." 

America's , lea dership in gen-
e rating creative new ideas, he 
warned , was being challenged by 
g rowing competition from other 
nations. 

"The race belongs to the swift-
est," Brody sa id . "We must keep 
running." 

Tn particular, Brody decried 
sh rinking government investment 
in research and development. In 
I 965, federal R&D tota led more 
than 2 percent of America's gross 
domestic product , accorrling 
to the Whitc H ouse Office of 
Management and Budget; in 2005, 
it is estimated to be less than half 
a~ much. 

nder the administration of 
President .eorge \v. Bush, most 
new rescarch funds have flowe.d 
toward defense technology. 
And eve n thC Defense Advanced 
Research Projccts Admi ni stration, 
whicb provided the sccd money for 
creation of the Lnternet, has shifted 
its f1lC[l~ toward "applied" rescarch, 
instead of the chin-scratching, theo-
retica l kind loved by pointy-headed 
academics. Ilowever, it is the latter 
- what Brody calls "fu r-out frontier 
rescarch" - that has proven to pro-
vide the larges t long-teml economic 
gai n. 

" Boy, wc've gOt a big problem 
on our hands," said Georgc Mason

University economic df!velopment 
professor and best-sclling author 
Richard Florida a month before 
the Johns Hopkins forum just sev-
eral blocks' away. -

]n 2002, Florida wrote "Thc' 
Rise of the C reative C lass," a book 
showing how a new "cr eative class" 
was transforming the America n 
economy. But in june, Florida was 
lau nching his second boo k, omi-
nou Iy titled "The Flight of thc 
Crearive C lass." 

His basic thesis is that other 
cou ntries have "gotten hip to the 
ta lent thing." And America, which 
has long relied on foreigners to 
make up nearly half of its gradlb 
ate smdents in math and sciencc 
fie lds, i~ falling behind. In partiClI-
lar, tringcnt vi a rcgulations and 
the perccption of xenophobia in 
the post-9I11 cra have driven for-
eign students to other countries, 
particularly Canada, he warned. 

Without major changes in pri-
o riti es, Florida and Brody say that 
new inn ovation on university cam-
puses will not sustain itself. 

For now, though, that may not 
be of much concern to students. 
As Doolittle would surely point 
out, "entrepren euria l pi ri t" is 
not a category measu red on the 

ourse and Professor Evaluations

MONDAY, NOVf.MBER 28, 200S 

Barkley: 
'Sir Charles' 
tops hottest 

male athletes 
continued from page 16 

absurd at first, but end up being 
right in the end. 

Case-in point: "They [Phoenix 
Suns] are like the Jackson Five 
without Michael. That's exacdy 
what losing Amare Stoudamire 
is." 

All of this makes it no sur-
prise that he was named Sports 
fllustrated's Most Intriguing 
Character. 

Barkley probably had his glory 
days about 12 years ago; he was 
retired for a couple years and, if 
it wasn't for his gambling habit, 
he probably wouldn't remain on 
television - but thank God he 
still is. 

Every sport needs a Sir Charles, 
someone not a fraid to say what's 
on their mind, not afraid to admit 
that they' re wrong, and someone 
who is able to poke fun at every-
thing and anything that comes 
their way. 

Chris Rose: "You used to 
be ca lled the Round Mound of 
Rebound . Just how round are you 
these days?" 

Sir Charles: "A few doughnuts 
away from a complete circle." 

He's not known for his all -
American Abercrombie good-
looks or his Greek-god body, but 
he'll go head- to-head with you 
in any debate, teach you how to 
perfect your golf swing (hmmm, 
Charles grabbing you from 
behind), and tell you why you're 
wrong even when you're right. 
And that's what makes him the 
sexiest male athlete in the past 
and present. 

TH E UCSD GUARDIAN 

Basketball: Tritons to head 
north for weekend matchups 

continued from page 16 
Poppen and two apiece from 
sophomore guards Clint Allard 
and Jason Bull. Patterson's layup 
at the 4:37 mark capped the 25-
8 run and brought the Tritons 
within three, the closest they had 
been since the opening minutes 
of the game. 

Unfortunately, head coach 
Bill Carr's squad never was able 
to capture the lead or the tie as 
the Amelopes went an aston-
ishing II-of-12 from the free-
throw line down the stretch to 
finish with a 12-point victory. 

Gra'nd Canyon benefited 
from double-digit scoring efforts 
by all five of its starters, led 
by Jason Stromvall's 16 points 
and game-high eight rebounds. 
The Antelopes also shot more 
than 50 percent from the field, 
along with going 40 percent 
from the three-point range and 
88 percent from the line. The 
Tritons were led by Patterson's 
game-high 19 points and soph-
omore guard Andrew Hatch's 
five points, five assists and six 
rebounds, which tied Patterson 
for the team-high in rebounds 
from the point guard position. 
\Vhile the Tritons held tough, 
losing the rebound battle by a 
slight margin (27-26) against a 
strong Grand Canyon squad, 
which improved its record to 
3- 1 on the season, they suf-
fered from a cold shooting night,' 
going 40 percent from the field 
and below 30 percent from 
three-point range. 

The pre- turkey results were 
more successfu l for UCSD at 
Pomona -Pitzer University on 

ov. 23 . Although trailing fo r 
only 30 seconds in the first half, 
tile Tritons were unable to open 

up much of a lead against the 
Sagehens. A layup and two free 
throws by Allard in the last two 
and a half minutes of the half 
was enough to give UCSD a 
five-point lead at the b~ak. The 
second half went much like the 
first, with the Tritons leading 
for all but 34 seconds, but lack-
ing the ability to open up a 
comfortable lead . At the 4: I 0 
mark, UCSD's lead was down to 
one point after Sagehen reserve 
ThOmas Iloilo 's layup made the 
score 46-45. The Tritons, how-
ever, demonstrated the pilla rs 
of their team with stout defense 
and teamwork as they went on 
an 8-2 run in the final four min-
utes, with four different players 
scoring for UCSD. 

Allard led the way for the 
Tritons in their first win of the 
season, tying the game-high and 
his career~high with 18 points. 
while also dishing out a game-
high six assists . 

Junior guard Robby Peters 
also scored in double-dig-
its for the Tritons with II 
points, while sophomore Drew 
Spaventa notched a game-high 
five rebounds. The Tritons only 
allowed one double-digit point 
total from tile Pomona-Pitzer 
squad, with Ed Wexler- Baron 
tying Allard and Spaventa for 
game- highs of 18 points and five 
rebounds. 

UCSD will begin CCAA 
play on Dec. 2 with a game 
against Cal State Bakersfield at 
Rabobank Arena. 

Last year, the Tritons scored 
a huge 66-60 victory over the 
Roadrunners, their first win in 
12 prior m3tchups. The follow-
ing evening, the Tritons will take 
on Cal State Los Angeles.

UCSD beats Eagles after falling by one to S. Dakota 

No Cup 
Required 

Angie Lin 

Let's face it, when it comes to finding the hottest male athletc, Charle Barkley is 
the man . You can't deny it - and I 
certainl\' can't either. What's hot-
tcr tha~ 300 pounds of unbridlcd, 
tcamy muscle? 

Three-hundred pounds of 
sweaty, unbridled, steamy mu de 
constricted in a tight ports suit. 
That's why I reach back in time 
and choose Charles Barkley as the 
hottest male athlete.

due in part to a shooting stall in 
the second half, when the liitons 
made only 7-of-33 shots and were 
outscored 29-25. 

Junior Leora Juster had a tough 
time getting the ball to fa ll . 

"It was just one of those games," 
she said. "Just a goofy thing where 
[ was tnlggling wi th Shootillg but 
Concordia, for some reason, was 
opening up better."

Freshman Meghan Noud linked 
the Nov. 25 loss to problems wi th 
grabbing rebounds. 

"We will improve on that no 
doubt," oud said. "The game 
could have gone either way but we 
fought hard in the end and that tells 
you a lot about our tcam." 

Al l the Triton players seemed 
to be on their A-game on ov. 26. 
Aside from Juster's perfomlance, 
sophomore point guard Alexis ' 
Mezetta upped her ca reer high from 
Nov. 25's 11 points to 13 on Nov. 
26, along with five rebotmds and 
four assists. Noud contributed by 
netting 10 points in 16 minutes of 
play. After posscssing a merc seven-
point lead at the half, the Tritons 
outscored Concordia by a margin 
of 38 to 16 in the second half, to 
finish with a 29-point advantage.

Some players attribute the win 
to prepara tion and the dedication 
put forth by the T riton coaches. 

Team captain Kim Buffum said 
that "prac~ces are much longer this 
year and on a tight schedule. " 

"We do drill after drill wi th no 
breaks much like we do in a game, 
and that really helps," she aid. 
"The coaches arc very involved and 
good at correcting in each play. 
It's great to have tha t one-on-one 
instruction every day." 

Juster agrees that tough practic-
es have helped the team in games. 

"Coach OanellJ Jones keeps it at 
a very intense level 3l\d we try to 
feed off that intensity in the game," 
Juster aid. "When we don't, we pay 
fo r it. We hate to let her down." 

She added that the team's 
improvement is apparent because

the players are getting more com-
fortable at their positions. 

For these team members, sweat-
ing together has also brought them 
closer together. Wi th eight new 
player and many seniors gone, 
team chemistry remailled an uncer-
tainty at the beginning of the sea-
son. 

"It's definitely a whole new feel-
ing this year, but we're aLI very sup-
portivc and much more open wi th 
each other than I've seen in the 
past," Juster said. "There are also a 
lot of chardcters on the team, which 
brings loads of laughter." 

Furthermore, the close bond the 
players share may be the key to 
their interaction on the court. 

"I t's been a pretty smooth transi-
tion and our closeness is what sets 
us apart from other teams," Buffum 

said. "We are 1I1J pulling fo r each 
other. You can see it when our faces 
light up when one of our teammates 
scores." 

While the support system is 
strong in the team, Buffum feels 
the fan base has been lacking. 

"There were only like 15 funs in 
the stands at the last home game so 
we realJy need to get more people 
involved because a good set of fans 
truly adds to the game," she said. 
"Hopefully UCSD supporters can 
step it up some as well. " 

T he next opportuni ty comes on 
Nov. 30 in RIMAC Arena when 
the Tritons will go head-to-head 
against Alaska Fairbanks University. 
In early December, the team will 
take on two of the top teams in the 
conference, Ca l State Bakersfield 
and Cal State Los Angeles. 

Tritons gobble down 
vidory, stomach loss 
Men's basketball gets first win 
of season over Sagehens, 54-47 

By JOE TEVELOWITZ 
Staff Writer 

While everyone else busied 
in preparation for Thanksgiving 
festivities, the members of the 
UCSD men 's basketb;1I team 
spent their holiday playing two 
games in preparation for the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association season. 

The Tritons, in the midst of a 
nine-game season-opening road 
trip, traveled to Pomona-Pitzer 
University on Nov. 23 and defeat~ 
ed the Sagehen~ 54-47 for their 
first win of the season. On Nov. 
25, the Tritons were in Phoenix to 
take on Grand Canyon University, 
where UCSD lost by a score of 
72-60 after falling behind by 19 
points early in the game. 

The Antelopes opened up a 19-
o lead in the first seven minutes 
of play due to four early three-
pointers - two by Noe Alonzo 
- and three layups in a one-min-
ute span by Bryan Lee. UCSD 
freshmen forwards A.J. M~ulhardt 

and H enry Patterson and fresh-
man guard Shane Poppen put the 
first points on the board for the 
Tritons as part of a 12-2 run, 

. which brought the team within 
nine after the early deficit. Just 
as Grand Canyon seemed to have 
taken back the momentum, hold-
ing a 15-point lead with under four 
minutes to play in the half, UCSD 
made another charge, pulling to 
within eight before going into the 
half down 34-24. 

UCSD scored the first basket 
of the second half on a jumper by 
Patterson , but the Antelopes then 
began to increase their lead. Up 
again by 19 with 13 minutes, 45 
seconds left to play in the game on 
their home court, Grand Canyon 
seemed poised for a true "stuff-
ing." However, the Tritons proved 
unwilling to simply give up. Using 
the tactic that initially got Grand 
Canyon irs early lead, UCSD 
staned dialing in from long dis-
tance with one three-pointer by
