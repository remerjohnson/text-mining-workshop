Officer William Milligan issues a citation to a cyclist for violating the policy on the main Revelle walkway, 

Bicycle and skateboard policy 
causes controversy on campus 
By A.M. BEZZERIDES 
AuodIII. Nnn Editor 

Due to the controversy sur-
rounding the bicycle / skateboard 
policy, the UCSD police de-
partment has been led to find 
other methods of enforcement, 
while on the path to the lon,-
term goal of patterning the cam-
pus after UC Davis. 

The new policy prohibits bike-
riding, skateboarding, and roller 
skating through the main part of 
the campus from 7:30 am to 7:30 
pm except on weekends and 
holidays. The prohibited areas 
include the Revelle Plaza and the 
main walkway from the Revelle 
Plaza to Third Colle,e. An 
alternate path that runs around 
the campus throu.h the Revelle 
residents' parking lot has been 
marked off for bicyclists this 
year. 

According to UCSO police 
training director Randy Feedak, 
the Univenity began implement-
in, the new bicycle/ skateboard 
policy this year because of the 
"huge liability problem." 

Feedak referred to an accident 
at UC Irvine where' in November 
of 1986 a student, James A. Fitz-
gerald, was struck from behind 
by a bicyclist on a campus side-
walk and suffered and suffered 
brain dama,e and is paralyzed in 
both leas and one arm. 

Feedak said that UCSO's 
changing of the signs from 
"please" to "prohibited" was part 
of initiatin, the policy in a grad-
ual manner. He said that there 
was just a "warning system" in 
place first quarter. 

Now. however, students are 
finding that the policy is indeed 
beina enforced, with officers 
issuing citations to students who 
are violating the policy. 

Although these citations usu-
ally require the payment of a fine 
ranging from S to for an unregis-
tered bicycle to SSO for reckless 
or unsale ridina. two incidents 
have occurred in which the riden 

were taken into police custody. 
Judy Maloof, a araduate stu-

dent who witneued one incident 
whic& involved a skateboarder 
on Revelle Plaza on March II, 
recalled what happened: "The 
police officer told the skate-
boarder to stop. When he [the 
skateboarder] didn't, the officer 
started chasing him from about 
10 yards with his club, assaulted 
him, handcuffed him and took 

him away." She said, "itwasdef-
initely an act. of agreuion ... 

Feedak said that the initial 
infraction in the incident [ille-
gally riding his skateboard on 
Revelle Plaza] became a misde-
meanor, which is an arrestable 
offense, when the skateboarder 
failed to yield to the officer. He 
said that the student, was taken 
to the police station, where he

Third College 
elections voided 
By LETICIA VILLARREAL 
S"", Writ" 

The Third College Student 
Council subcommittee for elec-
tions' attempt to "humanize" 
Third College ballots led the 
Third College Judicial Board to 
nullify the election results for 
Third College student govern-
ment positions. 

The J udical Board rendered 
its decision Monday night on a 
complaint by Third College 
Student-at-Large candidate Carl 
Katz regarding mismanagement 
of this month's Third College 
elections. 

The board, in a written state-
ment to the Third College Stu-
dent Council, ruled the election 
results for Financial Director and 
Student-at-Lar,e invalid and 
called for new elections, which 
are tentatively scheduled for 
MayS. 

The board found no evidence 
to support Katz's allegation that 
the Elections subcommittee was 
"intentionally malicious" and 
biased in its choice of excerpts 
from "personal essays" written 
by Third College candidates on 
their application forms. 

The board decided ihat the 
subcommittee printed excerpts 
from the essays on the ballot to 
"humanize" it - providing some 
information to the voters about 
the candidates. 

The board also agreed with 
subcommittee chair Karen 

Fagan's assertaion that the 
absence of a statement on the 
ballot under Katz's name was 
due to the fact that he did not 
write an essay on his application 
form, and that attempts by the 
subcommittee to discuss the 
matter with him were "thwarted" 
by an illegible telephone number 
and address on his form. 

The board, however, agreed 
with Katz's assertion that the 
essay excerpts printed on the 
mimeographed ballots were used 
without the prior knowledge or 
consent of their authors, and 
that the application form did not 
reveal the purpose for which the 
essays were being requested . 

This led the board to declare 
the election results for Student-
at-Large and Financial Director 
void. 

The new elections will involve 
the original candidates the origi-
nal candidates only, but Carl 
Katz will not be among them, 
since he withdrew his bid for 
Student-at-Large this morning. 

The remaining ~ndidates for 
this office are Bob Kim, Paul 
Lanning, and Daniel Simons. 
The candidates fOT Financial 
Director are Mark Boatman, 
Jennifer Brinker, Peter Smee, 
and Eschelle Stapp.

SHORTS 
Ring Lardner, one of the blacklisted 
"Hollywood Ten," to speak on May 4 

Two-time "Academy Award-winning screenwriter 
Ring Lardner Jr. is one of the most famous victims 
of the Hollywood witchhunt of the late 19405 by the 
House Committee on Un-American Activities. He 
will appear at UCSD on Wednesday. May 4, at 8:00 
p.m. in the Mandeville Auditorium. 

Out of the hearings conducted by Chairman J. 
Parnell Thomas came an "unofficial Hollywood 
blacklist that destroyed the careers of many actors, 
writers and directors. Dashiell Hammett, Lillian 
Hellman, Dalton Trumbo, and Ring Lardner Jr. 
were among those who refused to testify. By the 
mid-l960s when the blacklist finally came to an end, 
the lives of more than 300 people (many of them 
innocent victims of "friendly" HUAC witnesses) had 
been destroyed in spite of the fact that neither 
membership in nor affliation with the communist 
party has ever been illegal. 

During the life of the blacklist, Lardner and 
several other screenwriters managed to make a 
precarious living by writing under pseudonyms or 
through "fronts." It wasn't until the early 1960s that 
he was finally able to call through a studio 
switchboard and use his real name. In 1910, Lardner 
won an Academy Award and a Golden Palm Award 
for his script for the film M·A·S·H. 

Today, Ring Lardner Jr. remains an eloquent 
witness to one of the darkest chapters in domestic 
American history. 

Tickets are $8 for general admission, $1 for senior 
citizens, $4 for students, and are available at the 
UCSD Box Office and all TicketMaster outlets. An 
Evening with Ring Lardner Jr. is presented by 
University Events and Student Activities Office. 

Loret Miller Ruppe, director of the 
Peace Corps, to speak on May 13 

The University of California, San Diego, 
International Center will present Peace Corps 
director Loret Miller Ruppe as the featured speaker

May 13, 1988, at 7:30 p.m. at Peterson Hall. Ruppe, 
appointed in 1981 by President Reagan, will speak 
on "The Peace Corps of the 19805 and its Future in 
the 1990s." 

Tickets to the lecture and a reception that follows 
at the International Center are free; however, 
because seating will be limited, the public is urged to 
pick up tickets in advance at the International 
Center or UCSD Box Office. For more information

"Killing_ Dream" and "The Ribbon" 

The Committee for World Democracy will present 
"Killing a Dream" and "The Ribbon" Friday at 1 
p.m. in TLH 101. 

"Killins a Dream" is a report of the II-year-old 
terror/ war waged inside Mozambique by South-
:African sponsored "auerillas," the MNR. 

"The Ribbon" resulted from the events of 1986 in 
South Africa. Black and white women established 
small women's organizations to malee their voices 
heard in a cry for just resolution to the escalating 
conflict. These women sew, paint, and draw works 
which they join together to form the Peace Ribbon 
as a form of protest.

Continued from pa,e 1 
was eventually cited and released . 

Another incident involved a 
cyclist who failed to yield to an 
officer and subsequently took a 
swing at the officers. According 
to Feedak, this individual was 
not a student. He described the 
incident as "resisting arrest in a 
way." He explained, "We don't 
throw cuffs on every person, 
only if they're using unnessary 
force." However, he added, "It 
sbould never get to an assault." 

Warren freshman Robin Sam-
uel said in response to the two 
incidents of arrest, "I think they 
just overreacted." He added, "I 
think UC cops have to prove 
their self-worth because people 
don't thinle they're real cops." 

Currently, Feedak refers to 
the enforcement of the current 
policy as something that needs to 
be done until the larger plans of 
the future are completed. Fee-
dale, who used to work at UC 
Davis, said that in order to have 
a campus which is geared to 
bicyclinS the way that Davis is, 
the central part of the campus 
has to be closed to vehicular traf-
fic. This is part of a 10nl-tefV1 
plan which would include turn-
ing current intersections on Gil-
man into traffic Circles. 

Feedak explained that "if 
you're loinl to talee something 
away [freedom to ride every-
where], you're going to have to 
give them [bikers and skate-
boarders] and alternative," such 
as integrating bilee and pedes-
trian paths into new building 
sites. 

Gable Beurskens, with the alter-
native transportation depart-
ment, sees chanles in the future 
for the campus. "The school is 
loing to grow, so we have to 
start now so we can grow with 
it." He continued, "I believe there 
will be a need for separate [bike 
and pedestrian] paths, ones that 
are accessible to classes ." 

However, he added that it is 
all dependent on the plans for 
more campuses and on funding 
from private Irants. With regard 
to these future separate paths, 
Feedale said that sleateboards 
would probably be allowed to 
ride on the same paths as the 
bicycles. 

Officer Randy Feedak 

Third senior Sean Flanagan 
doesn't think that skateboarders 
are loing to be allowed to skate 
with bicyclists: "They're [the 
University] Iradually trying to 
ease it out, pretty soon you're 
not goinl to be able to skate 
anywhere, and there aren't 
enoulh skat~rs to fight it." 

Flanagan said, "The present 
bike paths are okay for bikes but 
not for skateboards. You can't 

skate in the street or a parking 
lot; I've been stopped for that 
before." 

When asked ifhe was going to 
keep skatins, Flanagan said, "I 
paid $145 for my skateboard and 
it's my transportation, I should 
be able to tise it." 

Economics professor Theo-
dore Groves, who worked on a 
bicycle/ skateboard safety task 
force which advised the vice 
chancellor, said that the task 

as a "I0od gesture." However, he 
said, "maybe they're just tryins 
to malee up for the police brutal-
ity with the free cokes." 

As part of his future plans, 
Feedak said he would include a 
"limited duty peace officer" who 
would be responsible for any-
thinl that has to do with bicy-
cles, such as stolen reports, 
licensing, and living out tickets. 
He said that this bicycle officer 
would be a solution to the com-

plaints from people that the 
police haven't been able to en-
force enough because of priori-
ties. 

Feedak concl.uded by sayins 
that althoulh now, "we have to 
write citations because people 
aren't complying," be thinks it 
can be a "really good biking 
campus." 

"We want them to ride, but we 
want them to ride in a safe way," 
Feedak said. 

force recolnized the need for r---------------------------
some policies to be formulated 
before there were any serious 
accidents. 

Groves said that because the 
chancellor felt tbe University was 
in "vulnerable" position, "We 
[the task force] were Biven the 
job of finding a temporary solu-
tion without usinS much money. " 
However, he said that the tasle 
force felt "education is far better 
than punitive measures." 

Feedale shares Groves' view: 
"You can let a whole lot more 
done by positive than negative 
enforcement." It is this philo-
sophy that has lead to a program 
Feedale is loing to instigate to 
encourale compliance with the 
policy. 

"If we [officers] see people 
who are complyins by walleinl 
their bilees or carrying tbeir 
skateboards, we're going to re-
ward them by Bivinl our cou-
pons from the Grove [CAffe], the 
[Triton] Pub, and the bilee shop 
for tbings like free colees or bike 
tune-ups," Feedak said. "It's 
loing to be a sporadic kind of 
thing."

Hunter S. Thompson 
Darkness at Noon 

"They also serve who only sland and wail." - Ukranians 5:78. 

F our years is a long time in politics, or at least that's what the boys in the business will tell you. And maybe it's true, if your name is Gary Hart or Ed Meese . .. or George Bush, for 
instance . 

There is not much argument in the business about who had the 
longest four years of al1 : George is a clear winner. He has suffered the 
slings and arrows of a genuinely outrageous fortune for what must 
seem to him like 44 years suffering in silence the mockery and abuse 
ofthose al1 around him and the idle contempt ofthose further away .. . 
He was forced to deny that he ever really participated in any 
meaningful decisions by the White House inner circle: He was at the 
Army-Navy game, he claimed, on the day of that fatal meeting on 
Dec. 7, 1985, that set the Iran-contra deal in action. 

Dumb George, they caUed him. AU he did was sit there and roU his 
eyes helplessly whenever the talk got serious. He knew nothing, saw 
nothing, said nothing - except for the War on Drugs, which they put 
him in charge of. 

Ho ho ... The price of cocaine in Miami dropped 50 percent in two 
years and a vicious dope-running thug is now in charge of the 
Panama Canal. The war was a hopeless failure and a bad deal for 
George - along with all the other wrong and ugly things he got 
blamed for - and he swore in his heart of hearts that he would get 
even .... 

W hich he d id . He stomped his enemies like peasants and ran them out of the territory. The Preacher Robertson is gone now, crushed swiftly and silently in the South Carolina 
primary - and three days later, on the fabled Super Tuesday, he 
destroyed Bob Dole by winning 16 out of 17 states and strutting 
around like a hedgehog. 

The Republican side of the ledger is brutaUy balanced now. AU 
those who dared to challenge Dumb George have been systematically 
croaked - and we are still only halfway through April and three 
months until the conventions. 

And George has already gigged them like frogs. Haig, Kemp, 
Robertson, du Pont, Dole ... That is a lot of big frogs to gig in two 
months, Jack: If he were a civilian, he'd be locked up for murder. 
He's killed more people than Ted Bundy. 

This news was received by about 77 percent of the voters in 20 
states with whoops of unrestrained joy. Bush was massively exoner-
ated and crowned as the next president. .. It was harsh and it was 
weird , but it was also true. 

We\1 ... 1 make book on these things, from time to time, and if J 
had to make numbers today I would put Walsh off the board and 
Jesse Jackson at about the same place 1 had him on the chart last 
October, which was 77-1. 

Jesse has always been a bit of a mystery to political journalists -
even the best of them, like Mary McGrory, who wrote a column that 
says. in a nut, that Jackson would and should be an easy bet to win 
the Democratic nomination except that he is not a White man and 
can't possibly be elected . 

But he must be on the ticket, she adds, because he has become too 
powecful to dump which has become a nasty things for the party 
gurus to cope with. "The net result of the Southern primaries was to 
put Jackson squarely in the catbird seat," she wrote. 

Their only hope, outside of Bush getting busted for perjury and 
relentless malfeasance for his long-denied role in the sleazy Iranian 
business, is for Jackson to See the Light and Get Serious and Do 
What's Best for the Party - puUing out, rolling over, selling out his 
own people and hunching down to a Pakis tani way of life: Let the 
Market Speak, as they say in Karachi , and always sell your daughters 
to a relative. 

But Jesse will probably not do that, for reasons of his own, and the 
party's assumption that he will act in the end like some kind of 
statesmanlike Uncle Tom is not likely to bear fruit. Jesse has been in 
the business too long and knows it too wen to go down that easy; he 
has hung out on too many street corners and jumped too many hotel 
bills and begged for money too many times to sell it all out for the 
sake of the Democratic Party. 

If he's as big a problem as they say he is, there are easier ways to get 
rid of him than treating him likea Paki and expecting him to roll over 
for nickels and dimes. 

They double-crossed him in '84, and they will try to do it again this 
year ... That is the nature of politics. Only the corrupt survive, 
usually with different stories which is almost the same as saying, in 
political circles these days, that one more general election can't be 
much of a problem for a man with the right connections. 

T he outlook is for another series of bad blunders by the Demo-crats and another gift to the GOP ... Bush was an easy mark this time: He was a cipher and a wimp, and he would not be 
with us if Dole hadn't let him off the hook in New Hampshire. 

That is a hideous reality to confront at this stage of the campaign: 
Ronald Reagan's dumb boy is a huge favorite to run this ruinous 
Atavistic Endeavor for another eight very long years. Nobody else is 
close .... 

The Democratic Party has whipsawed and cannibalized itself to 
the point where all of its arguments are shrugged off as self-serving 
lies and all of its presidential candidates are perceived as degener-
ates ... The party's only hope, now, is to have Bush arrested. If it ever 
comes to a vote, the Democratic Party is doomed; it will be their last 
election ... Like the Whigs in 1856, they will be like tits on a boar-hog. 
Utterly useless . And they will have to disappear.

Editor: 
The last few issues of the 

Guardian were largely devoted 
to the A.S. elections recently. 
For example, several students 
"on the street" were asked whe-
ther they planned to vote in the 
elections, including a grad stu-
dent in math. From his response, 
he obviously assumed, as I did, 
that he had a choice in the mat-
ter; it was only when 1 walked up 
to a voting booth that I was told 
graduate students were not al-
lowed to vote 

"I know I can't vote on A.S. 
undergrad officers," I protested, 
"but what about the referenda? I 
voted on them lasl year as a grad 
student!" 

I was sent to the A.S. office, 
where 1 eventually found some-
one willing to tell me what was 
going on: The GSA hadn't spe-
cifically requested to be in on the 
election, and, therefore, no grad 
student had a vote. It was par-
ticularly galling because as a 
member of the Co-ops and Enter-
prises Subcommittee of the UCB 
I was involved in drafting the co-
op referenda , and was now being 
told neither I, nor the substantial 
told neither I, nor the substantial 
number of other grad students I 
know who are involved in the 
co-ops, could vote on our own 
referendum! (Although I don't 
pay A .S. fees, and thus could leg-
itimately be excluded from the 
football referendum, I do pay for 
the Student Center 

Can the A.S. do something to 
insure that in future elections a 
sizeable portion of the UCSD 
student body is not excluded a 
priori from voting on issues that 
concern them?

Candidates 
Ignored 
Editor: 

[Guardian , April 25]. 
Unfortunately, Kachur is 

guilty of the same thing that he 
accuses the Guardian of; unfair 
coverage for every candidate (or 
at least the front runners) . I 
agree with him that the Guardian 
"has an obligation to present all 
the candidates to the students." 
And 1 agree with him that the 
Guardian has done a poor job 
with this obligation. But nowhere 
in his letter does he mention the 
Republican front runner or, for 
that matter, any other party's 
candidate. 

Kachur is entitled to his opin-
ion and has the right to express it 
in a letter to the editor. But he is 
wrong in faultling the Guardian 
for neglecting his candidate when 
he himself is neglecting someone 
else's candidate. All candidates, 
regardless of party affiliation, 
deserve equal coverage, not just 
Michael Dukakis.

Can't Vote 
For Jesse 
Editor: 

I am writing a letter to tel1 you 
why I am not voting for Jesse 
Jackson. It is not because I don't 
want to give the poor "a helping 
hand." Nor is it because the poli-
cies of the Reagan administra-
tion were such an inspiration to 
me that J want to see our next 
president continue them. It is 
because Jesse Jackson, at this 
time, is lacleing the experience to

Toxic Dump 
Lawsuit 
Editor: 

I have been fol1owing the toxic 
waste incinerator issue for almost 
a year now. Let me summarize 
the arguments and actions of 
Ogden Environmental Services 
bysaying that what we have here 
is prime material for Ii marvelous 
20-minute segment on "60 Min-
utes." 

Ogden, based in Paramus, 
N.J., has negotiated with the 
(recently-changed) management 
of General Atomic (G. A.) Tech-
nologies to use/ convert an exist-
ing Circulating Bed Combuster 
(CBC) incinerator to conduct 
experimental burns of toxic 
waste. This toxic waste may be 
of widely varying and possibly 
unknown origin. Furthermore, 
contrary to what Ogden would 
have you believe, earlier attempts 
to accurately monitor, much less 
control, the pol1utants rendered 
airborne during the functional 
test incinerations were fraught 
with problems and not success-
ful. 

The immense amount of pres-
sure on the federal (EPA) and 
state (DHS) agencies to sanction 
ways of disposing of the ever-
increasing amounts of toxic 
waste being generated through-
out California and across the 
nation is well-known. Legal me-
thods of toxic waste disposal can 
be quite costly. An enterprise-
gaining license to "dispose of" 
toxic waste by incineration can 
expect to be swamped with 
business (a.k.a. M-O-N-E-Y). 

The lawsuit against our City 
Council filed by Olden is fun-
damental1y preposterous and 
morally dissusting. Torrey Pines 
(zip code: 92121) is in the city of 
San Diego. San Diego is in the 
state of California. California is 
in a democratic nation - the 
United States of America. To 
operate something such as an 
incinerator, which spews gases, 
chemicals and particulate into 
the air for all nearby inhabitants 
to involuntarily breathe, the law 
requires the operator to prove to 
the federal, the state, and the 
local authority, (that's three, not 
two exams to pass, Mr. Mul-
liken) that permission to operate 
such a facility deserves to be 
sranted. 

In this nation, each level of 
government is independent and 
has its own concerns and prior-
ities. Each level of government 
deserves and has its own criteria 
for decision-making. The San 
Dieso City Council is composed 
of nine thinking, concerned, 
foward-Iooking individuals; not 
nine rubber-stamp-wielding 
clerks dispatched from Sacra-
mento or flown in from D.C. 

That our City Council is con-
cerned that one of its most 
prolific nei&hborhoods not have 
a potentially life-curtailing enter-
prise thrust in its midst should 
not be cause for a lawsuit. The 
local,overnment's responsibility 
in this matter runs deeper than 
the state's or fed's . Sacramento 
and Washington have decidedly 
different agendas. Fact: The day 
after our City Council's 7-2 vote 
at 2 p.m. on Dec 8, 1987, the 
EP A raised the level at which it

history has shaped itself under 
similar circumstances. 

The Federal District Court 
must back our City Council and 
its responsibility to conduct in-
formed, careful decision-making 
on land use within the city of San 
Diego. Ogden's proposed activity 
screams out for the completion 
of an Environmental Impact 
Report (EIR). Let Ogden prove 
left , right and center that their 
operation is unequivocably en-
vironmentally sound. Consider 
what's at stake! 

Safe Choice 

Why is sm so important to 
the United States and its future? 
This can be answered by looking 
at how far ahead the Soviet 
Union is over the United States 
in missile defense systems. The 
Soviet started research on such a 
system over 10 yeras ago. It is 
debatable how far they are ahead 
of the United States, but they 
must know something the Uni-
ted States doesn't. Why else has 
the Soviet Union suddenly be-
come so concerned about the 
research the United States is 
presently undergoing? 

Is it too much to require these 
gentlemen in three-piece suits 
from New Jersey to submit to an 
independently-conducted Envi-
ronmentallmpact Report (EIR)? 
I don't think that's too much to 

Editor: 
One reason why the Strategic 

Defense Initiative (SDl), better 
known as "Star Wars," has 
sparked so much controversy is 
the fear of the unknown. It is 
undoubtedly agreed on both sides 
of the issue that it would alter the 
course of history, much the same 
as that of the first dropping of 
the atomic bomb over Hiro-
shima. The onlywaywe can fully 
understand SDI is to look at the 
ultimate goal of it and to see how 

In addition to the research

could explode in your face if the 
bumper gets hit by another car. 

The Guardian mentioned that 
Jesse has plenty of political 
experience to lead the country. If 
his handling of PUSH funds is 
an example of experience t hat 
will lead the country, then we're 
in big trouble. Although PUSH 
fu nds were not handled illegally, 

they were handled very poorly. 
However, Jesse is making a 

valiant attempt to compensate 
for his lack of political expe-
rience. He is trying to get the best 
and brightest of the democratic 
party to serve in his administra-
tion, if he is elected (Carter is 
only one example). 

This is not enough, though. I 
think that the President of the 
United States needs a little expe-

rience in some other political 
position before he is a viable 
candidate. A president not only 
needs to rely on his staff, but be 
able to give themadvicefrom his 
own experience in government 
adminstration. What I am trying 
to say is that our President should 
be able to "talk shop" with his 
political and financial advisers. 

Time magazine pointed out 
something about Jesse recently. 
If he was white, Jesse would have 
been groomed for a political

position by some other white 
politican a long time ago. But he 
would have also been a political 
outcast by now, because of his 
meetings with Arafat, Castro, 
and his "Hymie-Town" com-
ment. So his color has been a set 
back as far as gaining political 
administrative experience, and 
has also kept him in this year's 
election as a strong candidate. 

Jesse has opened up a lot of 
new doors for politicians of color. 
And for this, I congratulate him.

Even our armed forces are much 
better integrated, and have more 
minority soldiers than our na-
tional government. And when 
you trail the military in carrying 
out progressive causes - that's 
sad. 

I would love to see a Con-
gressman Jackson, or a Senator 
Jackson for a while. To see how 
Jesse attempts to change domes-
tic and foreign P91icy and prac-
tice. Then I would have a lot 
more information to make a wiser 
decision as to whether he is cap-

I think it should be run. 

I am not into having blind

ground-based defense system. 
This will enable the Soviets to 
have a first generation missile 
defense system in which the Uni-
ted States has no counter capa-
bility. 

We must now ask ourselves if 
the world would be a safer place 
under these conditions. No Amer-
ican or any other citizen of the 
world will want anyone country 
to be so overwhemlingly super-
ior in this kind of military 
strength and technoloiy. As his-
tory has proven, from Roman 
times to the present century, the 
future oft his planet will be again 
at the mercy of a nation if this 
country possesses such capabil-
ities. 

Are we now faced with such a 
threat from the Soviet Union? 
We owe it to ourselves and the 
world to counteract this world 
threat. In whose hands will the 
world be safer - the United 
States or the Soviet Union? We 
are not dealing with bows and 
arrows, or guns or cannons; we 
are dealing with weapons that 
can destroy the planet we live on. 

Everyone should ask them-
selves the questions outlined 
above. It is of the utmost urgency 
to pursue the research, develop-
ment and the deployment of the 
Strategic Defense Initiative. We 
may not be given another chance.

Alcoholism is 'no disease' 
By BOB ENGLISH 
UCCUp SltHt 

SANTA BARBARA - Al-
most everything the American 
public believes to be the scientific 
truth about alcoholism is false . 

This gauntlet is thrown down 
by Herbert Fingarette, professor 
of philosophy at the University 
of California, Santa Barbara, in 
a new book, "Heavy Drinking: 
The Myth of Alcoholism as a 
Disease," just published by the 
University of California Press. 

Distilled from 20 years of study 
of the scientific literature on 
alcoholism by researchers in 
biology, medicine, psychology 
and sociology, the book contends 
that the public's misconcep-
tions - some of which are fos-
tered by those who run treatment 
centers- are blocking alternate 
and more promising methods of 
helping the heavy drinker. 

The most damaging belief-
and the one most stoutly de-
fended both by healthcare groups 

A.S. 
Continued from pale 1 
funds, were postponed until next 
week's meeting. 

"The long-term goal is to 
inform the UCSD community 
about crime prevention, which 
this campus is lacking in," the 
A.S. Security Chairperson said . 

In arguments against the allo-
. cation, Robert Frankl, Vice Pre-
sident of Finance, said, "The 
finance committee does not feel 
it would be prudent to spend 
over one quarter of general allo-
cated for this [program)." 

In items ot Immediate consid-
eration, a two-thirds vote was 
passed in favor of an underwrite 
of 5650 for food sales at the 
Cinco de Mayo celebration on 
campus, May 2-6. All proceeds 
from the sale will go to a student 
organization, Movimento Estu-
diantil de Chicaono de AztlilO. 

and Alcoholics Anonymous- is 
that alcoholism is a disease, he 
writes. It is alleged that the 
alcoholic's ability to control his 
or her conduct in regard to drink 
is destroyed bya bodily function, 
rendering the victim unable to 
voluntarily control drinking. 

This concept is totally lacking-
in scientific evidence, flies in the 
face of everyday observations, 
and is harmful to heavy drinkers 
because it absolves them of 
responsibility for their actions, 
according to Fingarette, a former 
research fellow of the British 
Royal Psychiatric College Ad-
diction Research Center and a 
consultant on alcoholism to the 
World Health Organization. 

From his studies and obser-
vations Fingarette has concluded 
that: 
• There is no one cause of 

alcoholism nor anyone pattern 
of drinking among "alcoholics." 
• Alcohol abuse is the outcome 

of a range of physical, personal 

Two new items of business 
were sent to the finance commit-
tee for deliberations: first, the 
,:Uocation of $78 for transporta-
tion expanses to send lecture 
notes manager to UC Berkeley 
for training purposes, and se-
cond, the a\Jocation of $SOO for 
transportation expenses to send 
the UCSD College Bowl team to 
Chicago for the National Col-
lege Bowl Tournament. 

Several members of the coun-
cil announced campus events to 
take place during Cinco de Mayo 
week: 
• The American-Japanese 

Cross-Cultural Society will meet 
from 7 to 9 pm next Tuesday and 
will serve Sushi and "American 
junk food" for $1 to all students 
interested in American/ Japanese 
relations. A discussion will take 
place and a Japanese Cultural 
video will be screened . 

and social characteristics that 
together predispose a person to 
drink to excess. 
• Episodes of heavy drinking 

are commonly triggered by im-
mediate events in a person's life. 

And just as there is no single 
cause, there is no single cure. 

Fingarette offers an entirely 
different approach to what he 
acknowledges is a serious human 
and social problem. 

"Let's view the persistent heavy 
drinking of the alcoholic not as a 
sin or disease but as a central 
activity of the individual'S way of 
life. 

"But as the daea show, heavy 
drinkers who are motivated to 
change and who are persistent in 
the face of setbacks can succeed," 
he concludes. 

"In the end, it always comes 
down to this: The drinker must 
take responsibility for reshaping 
his or her life and voluntarily 
ceasing alcohol abuse."

More construction underway 

U CSD builds up international relations 
By ARLEEN SAN MIGUEL 
S~Writn 

"It's a timely thing to do," said 
Barbara Blomgren, UCSD's man-
agement feUow for 1987-88. "The 
fact that there is an increasing 
interest [in international aware-
ness] at this time" is one of the 
reasons for the up-and-coming 
opening of the International 
House at UCSD. 

As as addition to other inter-
national programs offered on 
campus, International House will 
be a residential facility in which 
residents, with the assistance of

as international speakers, nation-

tivals (film, music, folk dance 
and food), discussions of world 
issues and cultural similarities 
and differences, research presen-
tations , and receptions for visit-
ing dignitaries . International 
House will be a place where 
people will live and learn the 
diverse cultural experiences of 
one another. 

Half of the 150-200 residents 
will be American and the other 
half will be students from all 
over the world. Juniors and 
seniors from UCSD's five col-
leges will make up 35 percent of 
the International House; 3S per-
cent will be graduate students, 
and 30 percent will be post-
doctoral students, visiting lec-
turers and researchers, and facul-
ties from different parts of the 
world. Though the accomoda-
tions are limited, the space is 
large enough so that the planning 
committee will be able to achieve 
a mixture of people with different 
national backgrounds.

For International House to be 
a success, it is necessary that it 
has a "well-balanced mix for a 
fruitful interaction," said Blom-
gren. 

The main criterion to obtain 
residency in the International 
House apartments will be the 
applicant's enthusiasm in meet-
ing different people from all parts

the "moving spirit" behind Inter-
national House. Dean Marsh has 
had international education ex-
periences, spending several years 
at the International House at 
New York, the oldest Interna-
tional House in the United 
States. 

Plans for the International 
House at UCSD were based on a 
study committee, appointed two 
years ago by Joseph Watson, 
Vice Chancellor for Undergra-
duates Affairs, that determined 
the need of an international 
house for the campus. The com-
mittee, chaired by Dean Marsh, 
assessed the level of interest in 
international relations addressed 
to U.S. and foreign undergradu-
ate and graduate students; de-
partment, program,and research 

unit heads; and post-doctoral 
and visiting scholars. Their re-
sponses led to discussions and 
eventually a recommendation of 
a facility that would be both a 
living center and an international 
and intercultural program. 

The International House at 
UCSD will be the second facility 
to be established at the University 
of California system. Though 
the planning committee has con-
sulted other International House 
Centers in the country, Inter-

national House at UCSD will 
involve its own programs and 
ways of operation. 

The six buildings of the Pepper 
Canyon apartment complex that 
are set aside as part of the Inter-
national House program will be 
ready for occupants in Septem-
ber of this year. Applications for 
residency for the 1988-89 aca-
demic year are still being ac-
cepted until May I and can be 
obtained from any on-campus 
housing offices. 

Bringing people together from diverse cultures so that they may 
share their experiences is the philosophy behind the International 
House. 

Sea World: Fishing for new 
ways to replenish the sea 
By LISA QUINTANA 
Stl4l/ Writer 

Although Sea World is close 
to UCSD, most students con-
tinue to think. of the marine park. 
as solely an amusement center 
and tourist attraction. Few real-
ize that within Sea World's 
sprawling acreage, a warehouse-
type facility is the center of a 
non-profit organization which 
works toward a greater under-
standing of marine life. 

Sea World Institute / 
Hubbs Marine Research Center 
(SWRI / HMRC), founded in 
1963, was created specifically 
under the philosophy to research 
ocean life as a means of returning 
something to that source - the 
sea - which gives so much to 
people, and preservation is one 
of the Institute'S greatest roles. 

Currently, SWRI/ HMRChas 
a scientific staff of 27 and fre-
quently houses visiting research-
ers. In addition to laboratories, 
the Institute possesses several 
classrooms and a growing marine 
library, of which undergraduate 
and graduate students from San 
Diego State University and the 
University of San Diego take 
advantage . 

Marie Robinson-Ching, public 
relations assistant , said that 
UCSD has yet to use SWRl's 
resources "because no one from 
UCSD has ever approached the 
head of the program. " Although 
this may be because of the 

proximity to Scripps, it is un-
likely that Scripps can provide 
the benfits of SWRI. 

the relationship that was es-
tablished in 1977 between the 
universities and the Institute is 
rewarding to' both parties. For 
the university, students have the 
benefit of facilities that the uni-
versities would have no other 
methods of supporting indepen-
dently, such as boats for off-
shore research and the number 
of animal subjects available at 
Sea World. Not many univer-
sities would be able to provide 
sea lions and dolphins to their 
biology students. Students have 
the opportunity of on-the-job 
experience -and perhaps the 
chance to have a more per-
manent relationship with SWRI. 

For the Institute, the students 
provide them with a source of 
technical assistants. Many stu-
dents, who are volunteers or who 
were hired to assist on certain 
projects, pursue research projects 
in other areas, and some end up 
working for the Institute as re-
search assistants. 

Robinson-Ching, herself a bi-
ology majorfrom SDSU, started 
in the classrooms at SWRI. "It 
was the most interesting work I 
had done while attending college. 
I felt that students from SDSU 
and USD were fortunate to have 
access to these types of resources 
. . . I never dreamed I'd end up 
working here, to she said. 

According to Robinson-
Ching, "Sea World is the largest 
contributor" to the Institute, and 
the area which SWRI occupies is 
leased from the park. The Insti-
tute also uses some equipment 
belonging to Sea World, and 
many of the sea lifeforms con-
tained in th.: park act as research 
subjects. There is allo a volunteer 
support-group called the Helms-
men, which contributes funds to 
back and expand different pro-
jects. There are also several 
corporate sponsors. 

SWRI additionally receives 
funds from the Califonia Depart-
ment of Fish and Game especial-
ly allocated to the Ocean Re-
sources Enhancement and Hatch-
ery Program (OREHP). Each 
year 55 million is raised by the 
Department from the sale of 
sport and commercial fishin, 
licenses and is divided among 
different research institutes to 
aid in the research of dwindlina 
fish species. Of this, SWRI re-
ceives less than 5200,000 an-
nually to support their white sea-
basa program. 

SWRI does not limit itself to a 
single research project at a time. 
A variety of divene programs 
are in production at once, and 
most are funded throu,h several 
different sponsors. Some of the 
current projects include research 
on a symbolic tone-langua,e with 
whales lind dolphins, which is an

relatively small considering that 
weights up to 90 pounds have 
been recorded in the ocean. Two 
of the tanks are controlled envi-
ronments, meaning that tem-
perature and light stages arc 
regulated so that the bass will 
spawn all year-round. In the two 
other tanks, the fish are allowed 
to spawn naturally. Several 
drums around the facility contain 
food for the baby fish , eggs, or

Part of the OREHP involves 
the release of juvenile "finger-
lings" into Mission Bay as an 
experiment in restocking coastal 
waters . This release of young fish 
has been done three times so far, 
the first time being in October of 
1986. The last group will be the 
first that scientists will be able to

FEATURES 

Forthe future. SWRI/ HMRC 
hopes to develop a full-scale 
hatchery for OREHP which 
would be capable of raising and 
releasing millions of juvenile fish . 
In other areas, the Instit ute 
continues to work toward the 
preservation and understanding 
of marine life with researchers of 
all different backgrounds, and 
Sea World hopes to establish 
two additional research centers 
like SWRI at their Texas and 
Aorida marine parks. Sea World 
Iso rescues several hundred in-

_ .Ired or beached animals annu-
ally. 

Perhaps the next time someone 
complains about the high cost of 
Sea World's admission, food and 
merchandise, they will remember 
that not only does Sea World 
york toward maintaining their 

own marine life, they also work 
toward preserving the natural 
marine life of California .

Commentary 
Continued from pale 11 
swimming meets or water polo 
matches anyway and that if 
UCSD only had a football team, 
you would definitely go to some 
games. 

Well, guess who voted down 
the football referendum (A refer-
endum which not only would 
have added a football team to 
the Triton sports program but 
would have also financially aided 
all the other sports here at 
UCSD)? You did. 

If you say that the reason that 
the football referendum was de-
feated was because not enough 
students on this campus care 
about sports, how do you explain 
people waiting in line for seven 
hours just to sign a softball team 
up for an intramural competi-
tion? And how do you explain a 
crowd bigger than most any 
crowd at an intercollegiate sports 
event this year at the IFC (Intra-
Fraternity Council) football 
final? (This appears even more 
unusual when the fact that 
Greeks are definitely in the 
minority on this campus is con-
sidered.) 

Perhaps you do not attend 
UCSD sports contests because 
you assume that because the 
students are not on scholarship, 

the competition is probably lousy 
anyway. Is that what you think? 
Try making one of these teams as 
a walk-on. earn a starting po-
sition, and then tell me the 
competition is lousy. 

So what can be done about the 
lack of support for our excellent 
overall sports program? At the 
immediate moment, probably 
very little. But if the teams here 
continue to perform as well as 
they have been, maybe word of 
mouth will eventually result in a 
great deal more fan support at 
the games. Let's hope so, because 
you're really missing out.

Baseball 
Continued from pale 11 
States are invited to compete in 
regional playoff actions, and 
because both Cal State San Ber-
nardino (No. S) and Stanislaus 
State (No.6) are both currently 
ahead of UCSD (No. 8) in the 
national ranlcings for Division 
III, the Tritons must win today 
in order to remain contenders 
for a spot in the postseason 
tournament. 

"Basically, if we lose to San 
Bernardino, we're out," UCSD 
intercollegiate 5 ports information 
director Bill Gannon stated in a 
telephone interview. "Stanislaus 

State has a virtual lock on one of 
the spots, and the other spot is 
still up in the air." UCSD and 
Cal State San Bernardino have 
split the season series at one 
apiece thus far, and should the 
Tritons win today they may be 
selected to the regionals based 
solely on head-to-head combat. 

Even if the Tritons do win, 
however, they have not guaran-
teed themselves an appearance 
in postseason play. Including 
today's game, UCSD still has 
three games remaining on the 
schedule and possibly two more 
if the twice-rained-out double-
header with Riverside is re-
scheduled. 

Softball 
Continued from pale 11 
much of the same for the offense, 
as the Triton hitters managed 
only four singles. Hurtt collected 
two of these singles for herself, 
but was not as fortunate on the 
mound as she gave up eight hits 
to the Chapman batters. Never-
theless, Hurtt was also victimized 
by the defense behind her which 
committed three errors in the 
fourth inning when Chapman 
scored the bulk of its runs. The 
game hardly put a dent in Hurtt's 
record either, which now stands 
at 14-34.

W. waterpolo 
drowns 
SDSU, 16-6 
By MICHAEL U'REN 
St"uWrltv 

The UCSD women's water 
polo team won their home opener 
Wednesday afternoon against 
rival San Diego State 16-6. The 
Tritons, now 11-3 and ranked 
third in the nation, led from the 
start and never looked back. 

After jumping out to an early 
2-0 lead the San Diego State 
Aztecs scored on a penalty shot 
to close to within one point. 

Both teams then traded goals, 
but with time running out in the 
frrs t period the Triton women 
scored again, leaving the score at 
4-2 after tbe first quarter of play: 

That was as close to the Tri-
tons as the Aztecs would get. The 
Tritons scored five consecutive 
goals and led 9-3 at the half. 
Both teams played sloppily in 
the third quarter but UCSD 
seemed to put it together in the 
fourth and final period and pulled 
away with the impressive 16-6 
victory. 

Commentary 

When asked about his team's 
performance, coach Denny 
Harper said, "I thought they 
played well. There were some 
mental lapses at times but over-
all I thought we had a good 
outing." 

Coach Harper was impressed 
by the play of both Caren Craw-
ford and Toya Ellis but was also 
concerned about Crawford's 
injury to her elbow. 

Crawford and company will 
have to be healthy in order for 
the third-ranked Tritons to win 
their own tournament this week-
end. They have set a goal to 
knock off two-time defending 
National Champions Santa Bar-
bara who will also be participat-
ing in this weekend's tournament 
here at UCSD. Other teams 
involved in the tournament are 
Cal Berkeley; San Luis Obispo, 
UC Irvine, UCLA and Stanford 
University. 

The Tritons will open tour-
nament play with Cal Berkeley 
at 4 pm on Friday, April 29. "I 

TI ..... ut - Head Coach Denny Harper gives his troops a breather on their way to a 16-6 victory over 
San Diego State Wednesday. . 
feel if we play up to our potential 
and have a limited amount of 
injuries we should have a good 
showing in tbe tournament," 
Coach Harper said. 

Shupe shoots 66 

So where are the fans? 
Lowest score since 1973 
helps UCSD to. third 
place finish in tournament 

I f you are an average UCSD student, you probably worry too much about grades, hate 
the alcohol policy, and are not 
reading this column. Chances 
are, you probably did not even 
turn to the sports pages. Further-
more, you are unaware that 
UCSD even has an intercollegi-
ate sports program. 

Okay, oleay. Maybe that's 
going a bit too far. But the fact is, 
you couldn't care less about 

. Triton sports . Admit it. Aside 
from the players, tbe coaches, 
the referees, and the score-
keepers, unless you're on the 
Guardian staff or have a friend 
on the team, you probably have 
not gone to any UCSD inter-
collegiate sports events this 
season. Maybe one. Al mosl. 

What this docs, in effect, is 
makes for incredibly small 
attendances at games and leaves 

the athletes no choice but to play 
only for their own exercise and 
self-gratification. 

So you say that you shouldn't 
be expected to support the 
UCSD spons program because 
this is a fine academic institution 
where schoolwork comes before 
athletics? Do you think that 
because most of the athletic com-
petition for this school is at the 
Division lllievel and none of the 
athletes are on scholarship, that 
maybe sports do not matter here 
anyway and theyarejustanother 
way for a bunch of jocks or 
jockettes to let off steam? Well, 
think what you like, but there are 
some serious flaws in this philo-
sophy. 

As far as work coming before 
athletics, there is little question 
that this is the case here, but that 
does not necessarily mean that 
sports sbould be vinually neg-

Softball swept 
Division II Chapman 
beats Tritons 5-2, 4-0 

By PHIL GRUEN 
Stll/! Writer 

Even though it probably will 
not hurt their playoff chances, 
the UCSD women's softball team 
dropped two rather convincing 
defeats at the hands of Chapman 
College Tuesday afternoon, S-2 
and 4-0. Because Chapman is a 
Division II school and UCSD is 
ranked sixth in the nation in 
Division III, it is doubtful the 
losses will prevent the 28-7-1 
Tritons from being selected for 
tbe regionals on May 8. 

Freshman pitching sensation 
Stacie Sasaki suffered an unus-
ually rocky outing against Chap-
man, giving up eight hits while 
striking out only two in the first 
game. Despite the loss, her record 
is still an impressive 14-4. Like 
pitcher Patty Hurtt who was 
tagged with the loss in the second 
game, Saski received very little 
hitting support from the Triton 
offense. The normally powerful 
UCSD bats only mustered three 
hits in game one. 

In game two, .the story was

lected. Take Harvard University 
for example. 

Here is a school which, quite 
obviously, prides itself in aca-
demics above all else. But that 
does not stop the students from 
coming out in droves to the 
football games, the crew races, 
and hosts of other events. And 
believe me, they do not give 
scholanhips for athletics in the 
Ivy League. 

So you argue that Harvard 
plays Division One ofthe NCAA 
and that if UCSD played in 
Division I you would probably 
go to the games? Yeah, right. 

The Tritons' water polo and 
swimming teams compete in 
Division I, but the crow(1s are 
stilI small. Oh, so now you 
counter that nobody goes to

-"Terrapin Station," 
Robert Hunter, Jerome Garcia 

IRVINE - You have to have an 
10 to pay cash at the Irvine Hilton, 
and all the buildings are boxes with 
exteriors just like those shades coke 
dealers wear - real friendly. 

Irvine doesn't like people on the 
streets. At the order of Carl Karcher, 
still popular in Orange County des-
pite the inconvenience of indictments 
for massive stock fraud, the Dead-
heads here last weekend for three 
shows were confined to the "camp-
ground," actually a huge asphalt lot. 

They probably liked it that way. 
The police keep' a low profile as long 
as the 'heads stay within their bounds; 
the parking lot was a free fire zone of 
merchants hawking mushrooms and 
T-shirts, acid stir-fry, MDMA 
and backrubs. 

Anyway, both the 'heads and the 
Dead have been kicked out of much 
nicer places than the Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheater. The band played three 
outstanding shows, which is about 
one more than can be expected from 
a bunch of old men who, as of late, 
Visibly tire playing three days in a 
row. 

The Grateful Dead are unique in 
the musical world for a number of 
reasons. For one thing, they're an 
American musical jukebox. If you 
sawall three shows, you saw songs 
written or inspired by: Bob Dylan, 
Chuck Berry, the Reverend Gary 
DaviS, Willie Dixon, Johnny Cash, 
the Mamas and the Papas, the 
Kingsmen, Bob Wills, Neal Cassedy, 
John Coltrane, Ken Kesey, and, a 
couple of British imports, Stevie 
Win wood and the Beaties. 

They are storytellers, creating a 
mood but demanding that the lis-

tener fill in the experience and mean-
ing from the details of their own 
lives. The open-endedness of their 
songs makes every concert an au-
dience';participation experience. If 
you want to sit back and be enter-
tained you're missing the point and 
will get bored, as many new, soon-
to-move-on fans find. 

The band plays completely differ-
ent sets of songs every night in a run 
at a particular town because most 
people who attend one performance 
will attend all of them. Rarely-played 
songs are prized. Over the weekend 
the 'heads were treated to the first 
California versions of "Louie, 
Louie," and the "Hey Jude" coda, 
Dylan's "Queen Jane Approxi-
mately" and the first version here in 
eight years of a Garcia-Hunter bal-
lad, "To Lay Me Down." 

There were also especially good 
versions of the Dead anthem, "Uncle 
John's Band," Traffic's "Dear Mr. 
Fantasy" (with the "Hey Jude" coda), 
a powerfully peaceful rendition of 
Dylan's "Knockin' on Heaven's 
Door, " the New Orleans parade song, 
"Iko-Iko," and the ballad, "Looks 
Like Rain" (inspirational verse: 
"Have 10" wei' heard the sound of street 
cats making Love/And guessed", their 
cries you were listening to a fight''') . 

Deadheads, who are surpassed in 
their statistical zeal only by baseball . 
fans, keep elaborate setlists. The 
Irvine setlists went as follows: 

Friday: Mississippi Half-step, Feel 
Like a Stranger, Franklin's Tower, 
New Minglewood Blues, Candyman, 
Queen Jane Approximately, When 
Push Comes to Shove, Let it GrOWi 

China Cat Sunflower, I Know You 
Rider, Louie Louie, Estimated Pro-
phet, He's Gone, Drums, Space, The 
Wheel, Gimme Some Lovin', All 
Along the Watchtower, Sugar Mag-
nolia/Black Muddy River.

"Incredible!" "Unbelievable!" "Fan-
tastic!" These were the three most 
common words overheard in the 
lobby of the Wiltern Theatre in Los 
Angeles Saturday night, following a 
stunning sold-out performance by 
Sinead O'Connor. Even more sur-
prising was the fact that few appeared 
disappointed by the relatively short 
50 minute show. 

Amid all the anticipation, the 
press coverage, and the Hollywood 
hoopla, Sinead stepped on stage, 
flawlessly delivered her material, and 
left leaving the capacity crowd daz-
zled. 

At an informal press conference 
earlier that day, Sinead Sat cramped 
on the Wiltern's elegantly carpeted 
floor surrounded by numerous col-
lege newspaper and radio repre-
sentatives. Initially a little nervous, 
the 21-year-old Irish singer re-
sponded briefly to the familiar ques-
tions she'd been bombarded with 
since her album, "The Lion and the 
Cobra," was released several months 
ago. Eventually loosening up, Sinead 
gave up biting her nails and began to 
answer quite openly the questions 
being asked by people no older than 
she. 

Avoiding questions about her 
work with U2 and about her hair (or 
lack of it), she covered topics ranging 
from the political aspects of her 
music to the recent birth of her son 
Jake. 

Asked about the dilemma of being 
a role model, Sinead answered ser-
iously, "I don't really think about it. 
But I'd be a bit worried if being a role 
model meant that you were solely 
responsible for the actions of a whole 
lot of people. Like you know when 
Janis Ian wrote that song, "Seven-
teen," apparently a whole lot of 17-
year-olds killed themse Ives . I 
wouldn't want to do anything like 
that." 

Growing up in Dublin, Ireland, 

Sinead hated school and dropped 
out at the age of 16. She took up 
singing because, "Largely it was an 
excuse to get out of school, which I 
didn't like at all, and singing seemed 
to be a far more interesting alter-
native." 

During this time she did various 
odd jobs until 1985 when Nigel 
Grainge of Ensign Records saw her 
performing in a rehearsal hall and 
encouraged her to move to England. 
Wishing to avoid the chance of being 
labeled an Irish folk singer, Sinead 
followed Orainge's advice. 

It was soon after her migration 
that U2's Bono heard Sinead's initial 
demo tapes and recommended her to 
fellow band mate, The Edge, for 
work on the soundtrack to the Irish 
film, "The Captive." The resulting 
song, "Heroine," which was known 
as the movie's theme, was an elegant 
yet powerful introduction for Sinead 
into the recording industry. 

Having finally finished her own 
writing and demo recordings, she 
entered the studio in the fall of 1986 
to begin recording her first album, 
"The Lion and the Cobra." But 
about three months down the line 
she scrapped the existing tracks, 
unsatisfied with the results. Unhappy 
with the producer that Ensign had 
assigned her, Sinead decided to pro-
duce the album herself the follOWing 
spring. 
- . The result is an incredible multidi-
mensional album that features 
Sinead's vast tonal scale and very 
personal lyrics. Discussing the lyrical 
content of the album she commented, 
"I don't know what it says to any-
body else. I didn't even consider 
what it would say to anyone else 
because I don't write songs for any-
body except myself. So I don't have 
any message for anybodYi whatever 
it sort of conveys to anybody else is 
their own business."

For the Huichol Indians, a 
tribe native to the northern 
mountains of Mexico, art 
imitates life at its simplest and 
still manages to be abstract. 
The simplicity of their art 
results from its practical use in 
the ceremonial search for the 
hallucinogenic peyote cactus. 
The Huichol fast for long 
periods before "hunting" the 
plant, which they symbolically 
refer to as "deer," and shoot 
the first find with miniature 
arrows as a metaphoric ges-
ture of the kill. 

These miniature bows and 
arrows can be seen on display 
at the Grove Gallery along 
with other ceremonial tools

While under the influence

plants which produces halluc-
inations when eaten, the Hui-
chol create yarn "paintings" 
that depict symbolic journeys 
and incorporate mythological 
and representational figures. 
The brightly-colored yarns are 
twisted into various shapes 
and patterns, and then are 
glued to a wood packing to 
give the appearance of a uni-
form "painting." Some of the 
colors and shapes are fantas-
tic, and the importance that 
the "deer" holds in Huichol 
culture dominates each scene. 

Alongside the Huichol ex-
hibit at the Grove is a display 

of Mexican folk art that re-
sembles the Huichol tradition 
of blending representational 
art with elements of the fan-
tastic. The papler macheskel-
eton figures made by the 
Unares family of Mexico City 
are shown griding cornmeal, 
hawking newspapers, playing 
musical instruments, and other 
everyday events. 

Another piece made in terra 
cotta and fired black shows a 
wedding couple with the 
groom portrayed as the devil 
and the bride as the grim 
reaper. 

The Huichol Indian exhibit 
together with the Mexican folk 
art provide an interesting view 
of Mexican culture and can be 
seen at the Grove Gallery 
through May 7.

the way of vengeance. 

Hodges and McGavin cruise 
the streets daily. They make 
almost no arrests (although 
McGavin tries, and Hodges 
lets them go); their responsi-
bility to the community is to 

maintain peace. Meanwhile,

In the greater Los Angeles 

area, there are approximately 
600 street gangs with over 
70,000 memhers. Last year, 
there were 387 gang-related 
killings in Las Angeles county. 
Combatting this activity is the 
Los Angeles Police Depart-
ment's gang crime division, 
C.R.A.S.H. (Community Re-
sources Against Street Hood-
lums). 

"Colors" is a captivating, 
realistic drama that serves to 
inform its audience. Sean Penn 
and Robert Duvall are effec-
tive and work well together on 
screen. Danny McGavin 
(Penn) is cocky, arrogant and 
conceited - a very appro-
priate role for Penn. Bob 
Hodges (Duvall) is a middle-
aged, five-year veteran to the 
C.R.A.S.H. program. He is 
calm and collected, and doesn't 
necessarily act as a superior to 
the gang members. McGavin 
has a purpose - to fight crime 
and make a bust. Hodges, on 
the other hand, does not jump 
at the chance to make an arrest, 
and maintains a respectable 
relationship with gang mem-
hers.

As a veteran, Hodges has 
earned the respect of the gangs, ' 
and is realistic; he believes in 
gaining the trust of gang 
members, and exchanging 
"favors." He doesn't take them 
in on routine charges (Le., 
drug possession, graffiti, van-
dalism - activity which the 
viewer sees constantly through-
out the film). He and the gangs 
have an understanding; no one 
wants to go to jail, so Hodges 
lets them go on the provision 
that they 'owe him one.' 
Hodges only intends to keep a 
few kids from getting killed 
and keep the dangerous ones 
out of trouble. 

It is this struggle which 
inspired director Dennis 
Hopper to enlighten viewers 
with a true-to-life depiction of

Ziggy follows consciously 

by jeff lambeth 
hi.tul writer 

It 's a good thing Ziggy Mar-
ley isn't trying to deny his 
roots.

gae prophet Bob Marley, looks, 
writes and especially sounds 
startlingly similar to his legend-
ary father. Comparisons are 
both constant and inevitable. 

the elder Marley offered. 
While the late Peter Tosh, 
along with Jimmy Cliff, Steel 
Pulse and Third W orid have 
all made significant stabs at 
the reggae crown, the throne 
has remained empty since Bob 
Marley'S death . 

that Ziggy is just a sound-alike 
rehashing his father'S work. 
Ziggy, while acknowledging his 
roots and family in his songs, 
addresses themes and issues 
prevalent in today's world. 

liT omorrow People," the 
album's first single, which is 
already getting significant radio 
airplay, reveals Ziggy's strong 
ties to his roots and to his fam-
ily. "If you don't know )'OUT 
past, " he sings, " )'OU don 't know 
your future ." 

And with the recent release 
of the 19-year-old Marley'S 
outstanding album, " Con-
scious Party," the hype and 
hoopla surrounding reggae's 
child prodigy is certain to in-
crease. 

With " Conscious Party," 
Ziggy Marley and the Melody 
Makers (the backing vocal trio 
consisting of Ziggy's brother 
Stephen and sisters Cedella 
and Sharon) may be leading a 
reggae renaissance. With the 
first spin of the lO-song offer-
ing, it becomes apparent why 
critics are so enthusiastic about 
Ziggy. 

"Conscious Party" reflects 
and projects Ziggy's devout 
religious views on several 
tracks. Rastafarianism -the 
religion which makes a corre-
lation between the cArrying of 
the Biblical Jews into captivity 
and the deportation of blades 
from Africa during the slave

Since the death of Bob Mar-
ley in 1981 from throat cancer, 
the reggae world flasn't had 
the kind visionary leadership 

The album has the sound 
and feel of the great Bob Mar-
ley albums "Survival" and 
"Uprising." That's not to say

"Equus," a Uttle Boots 
production, playing at the 
Lyceum in Horton Plaza 
proves to be an exciting, 
eerie and even erotic drama 
which takes the audience 
on an electrifying journey 
into the mind of a 17 -year-
old stableboy whose pecu-
liar passion for hor8eS is' 
unleashed when he horri-
fidy blinds six of the horses 
that he worshipS. 

If you like plays that sticle 
to the status quo and are 
easily understood, then 
don't bother seeing this one; 
on the other hand, if dra-
matically different and per-
plexing plays interest you, 
then "Equus" is a must. 

This production will run 

marvelous "Lee and Molly" 
and the cheerful "New Love." 
"Lee and Molly" is a wonder-
ful, catchy song about interra-
ciallove. It explores the reser-
vations of an older generation 
toward, as Ziggy calls it, 
.. White gu, in /otJe with black 
bea""." Ziggy sings, "Dadd, 
got drunk one da" he beat the 
hell out of poor old Lee . .. Wh, 
should the, hide to share strong 
moments!" 

But Ziggy is at his best in the 
socially, politically conscious 
songs such u the title track 
and, especially, "Dreams of 
Home." 

On the title sonK, Ziggy sings, 
"Everyone is happ, tonight, but 
not becawe of the world. And 1 
know there'll be no fight in such 
a consciow parr,. " With these 
words, Ziggy evokes his 
father'S image. For through all 
the struggles about which he 
writes, the soog is ultimately a 
celebration, a triumphal cry to 
transcend the problems of the 
worl!i. 

"Dreams of Home" is the 
reggae answer to U2's smash 
"I Still Haven't Found What 
I'm Looking For." The song 
features the female members 
of the South African cast of 
the play "Safarine!" singing 
background. Behind ominous

TIan's films are distinguished by a majestic, almost mystical

Continued from page 3 
tend with the brotherhood of 
the llangs. 

After the initial murder, the 
viewer witnesses various 
events which contribute to an 
inevitable confrontation at the 
end. The suspense builds and 
the viewer, knowing a meeting 
is unavoidable, is continuously 
on the edge of his seat. 

"Colors" depicts the strug-
gle for supremacy between the 
two gangs - the endless 

rivalry that consistently results 
in violence, and inevitably ends 
in fatality. The conflict is never 
a question between individu-
als - it is between groups. 

Hopper portrays the signif-
icance of peer pressure and its 
power to influence confor-
mity. As a group, these gangs 
fear nothing - the support 
and loyalty thpy give each other 
overpowers any fear of injury 
or death. 

This movie is p.owerful 
enough to keep the audience 
in a state of stunned aware-
ness, and its reality will shock 
you - as it did at the screen-
ing in Mandeville Auditorium. 
What was a loud and viva-
cious audience at the begin-
ning of the movie became a 
solemn, speechle,!s audience 
at the end.

On Thursday, April 28 at 8 pm, UCSD will get its first 
look at an all undergraduate theatrical production of "The 
Elephant Man." Calling themselves the UCSD Theatre 
Ensemble Group, the talented cast and crew has put an 
enormous amount of time and energy into the upcoming 
production. 

Using a small but adequate budget, the ensemble has 
managed to create the necessary props and costumes in order 

- to produce a respectable rendition of Bernard Pomerance's 
1977 play. 

Though the drama department has supplied an academic 
advisor for this production, everything is being done entirely 
by the students. Leading the cast by both directing and 
starring the title role, Reggie Mathes is guiding some of 
UCSD's finest undergraduate performers. 

The UCSD Theatre Ensemble Group's production of 
"The Elephant Man" will run from Thursday, April 28 
through Sunday, May 1. All performances will be held at 8 
pm at the Warren Theatre for only $3.

Sinead 
on stage 
Continued from page 1 

No doubt th~ most pressing 
question on everyone's minds 
Saturday night was whether 
Sinead could capture on stage 
the same passion achieved on 
her album. Though the odds 
were against her because the 
album is overlayed with nu-
merous trades and effects, she 
had left the press conference 
with a note of confidence. 
"There isn't anything really 
like playing live. It's really 
exciting and in many ways it's 
better than recording," Sinead 
said. 

Opening the show with the 
album's first and most haunt-
ing cut, "Jackie," Sinead 
crooned, "Jackie left on a cold 
dark night/Telling me he'd be 
home/Sailed the seas for a 
hundred years/Uaving me all 
alone/I've been dead for 20 
years /I've been washing the sand 
with m, ghastl, tears/Searching 
the shores /for m, Jackie-a," 
Instantly aware that she was 
indeed able to meet their 
expectations, the crowd re-
sponded exuberantly. jumping 
to their feet immediately at 
the start of her current hit, 
"Mandinka. " 

Doing a fantastic job repro-
ducing the album's occasion-
ally complex instrumentation 
was her back-up band, which 
included bass player Andy 
Rourke and drummer Mike 
Joyce, both of which are from 
the now defunct band, The 
Smiths. Though it was ru-
mored that all or several 
members of U2 were attend-
ing the performance, no sur-
prise guests joined Sinead on 
stage as she roared through 
the remainder of her II-song 
set. 

Surprising the crowd with 
an eloquent rendition of The 
Smith's "The Hand That 
ROCKS the Cradle," Sinead 
proved that she can soothe as 
well as scream. Also notable 
was the inclusion of two new 
unreleased songs. The first, 
still untitled, and the second, 
"Jump in the River," came off 
extremely well and promised 
that an equally fantastic album 
will eventually follow. 

She ended her ~-minute 
set with a stimulating version 
of her new single, "Lay Your 
Hands on Me." 

Showing that she knows the 
art of making the audience 
want more, Sinead reappeared 
on stage alone armed only 
with an acoustic guitar. Per-
forming the album's most 
produced and entrancing song, 
"Troy, " in the simplest manner 
possible, the crowd met her 
with an eager and appreciative 
response . Die-hard fans 
screaming, "I love you, Si-
nead" in response to the 
inquisitive lines of the song, 
even brought a smile to the 
otherwise somber singer, 

As the crowds poured out 
of the theatre less than an 
hour after they'd entered, it 
was easy to see that Sinead 
O'Connor really il loved.

"Look how long we've been away, 
How Long are we to stay? Look 
how Long we've been away from 
home, how long are we to roam?" 

Producers Chris Frantz and 
Tina Weymouth of the Talk~ 
ing Heads deserve much credit 
for this album as well. They 
brought in Rolling Stones 
guitarist Keith Richards for a 
captivating, roaming guitar 
track on "Lee and Molly." 

Also, fellow Talking Head 
Jerry Harrison plays keyboard 
on "Tomorrow People" and 
the pointedly political song 
"We Propose." 

The album's overall sound 
is excellent, combining classic 
reggae textures with "modern 
high tech punch." But it is 
Ziggy's familiar voice and 
artistic vision which make 
"Conscious Party" a reggae 
masterpiece.
