Courseload equivalencies fonnula under fire 
By MA TIHEW WT, Staff Writer 

Teacher unions and adminis-
trators throughout the UC system 
are keeping a watchful eye on UC 
San Diego's new policy of 
determining a lecturer's workload 
and pay. 

Under this policy, which weighs 
the efforts involved in teaching a 
class, all writing and linguistic 
courses were evaluated 25 percent 
less than most other classes and 
150 percent less than some science 
courses. Because of this policy, 
Jllany lecturers are forced to teach 
one-third more classes for the 
same salary. 

The UCSD administration is 
requiring certain lecturers to teach 
twelve courses a year despite a 
contract negotiated last year with 
the teachers' union that set the 
maximum workload at nine. 

Members of the American 
Federation of Teachers (AFr) at 
other universities within the 
system fear that if the 
administration at UCSD is allowed 
to enforce this equivalency policy, 
other UC administrations will 
adopt similar policies. 

"UCSD is the only place where 
nine can equal twelve," Marde 
Gregory, AFT Local Union 
President at UCLA , said . 

"Obviously the administration at 
San Diego has no concern or 
interest whatsoever in the quality 
of the writing, instruction and 
critical thinking development for 
its students. It is absolutely 
ridiculous for them to think that 
making lecturers teach three more 
courses a year does not affect the 
quality of the instruction." 

Although no other UC schools 
have encountered San Diego's 
disputes over courseload 
equivalencies, Santa Barbara's 
union recently filed an unfair laboT 
charge similar to the one the union 
here filed against the UCSD 
administration for instituting a 
mandatory nine-course workload 
for all departments. The unions of 
both universities contend that the 
determination of workloads lies 
with the departments and not 
administrations. 

Before the mandatory nine-
course workload, many 
departments, such as history, only 
required their lecturers to teach six 
or seven classes. Currently, all 
departments must make their 
lecturers teach the equivalent of 
nine courses. 

"We [the departments] thinkwe 
are the best judge of what the 

Dr. Thomas Dublin, associate professor of history, contends 
students suffer due to increased lecturer workloads. 

standard (workload) should be for 
our departments," Michael Parrish, 
History Department Chairman 
said. 

The new equivalencies, in most 
cases, allow lecturers of science 

, 

courses to teach fewer classes than 
those who teach in the humanities. 
All history and psycholog~lasses , 
for example, count only as one 
course whereas some physics 
classes are valued at 2.25. A lecturer 

Skateboard club project rolls to a halt 
By ISABELLE TIHANYI 

"Ready to Shred!" (R.T.S.) UCSD's new skateboarding club, has 
launched its first year with a Wide-ranging series of fund raising and 
organizational activities only to find its most prized accomplishment 
- a wooden structure built by the skaters as a practice and workout 
facility ~nown as "1/2-pipe ramp" - a center of conflict. 

On April 23, two weeks after its completion, the skateboard club was

notified by a memo from Director of Campus Recreation, Diana 
Chadwell, that the U-shaped structure was not to be used until further 
notice. Chadwell stated that there is a !roblem concerning the 
"standard steps which need to be followe according to Umverslry 
Procedures and Policies." 

Entirely constructed of plywood, the ramp I located in a remote 
area of the campus in a clearing among the eucalyptus crees. 

The R.T.S. club is a fully registered student organization led byMuir 
junior Steve Villarreal. Regarding the shut-down. Villarreal said. "It's 
very discouraging. The whole club is bummed and would be 
devastated should the ramp be lost after months of hard work." 

Laurel Dean, Recreations Club Coordinator and R.T.S. advisor 
explained the problems which have prompted the university to take 
such actions. Primarily, R.T.S. did not follow the usual procedures 
required prior to the construction of any structure on campu 
property. Neither .the structure nor the location was in any way 
approwd by the administration. Also not cleared was the problem of 
liability insurance. The university cannot take responsibility for 
injuries due to ramp usage. 

However. Dean has already successfully geared her efforts toward 
solving the problem of liability for skateboarders in a previous 
situation. In a similar problem faced by the Del Mar Skate Ranch. 
in~urance difficulties nearly terminated the facility . Although they had 
never had a claim and their premiums were actually going down, the 
insurance company went out of bUsiness and th~y lost their policy. 

The park was saved by the Boy ScoutS of America who assumed 
liability. Should the university not wish to take responsibility, the club 
members could become part of the Boy CaUl's "Exploring" program. 
DeSigned specifi ally for speCIal-interest groups involved in a 
particular actiVIty. the program also fo u es on Scouting ideals. Once 
tlie. unit is officially fanned , liability insurance is included. 

Dean ha approached the Scouts and spoken to the head of Post 
Development in an Diego. The respon e ha been p itlve and they

of physicS. therefore, would get by 
with teaching only four classes a 
year but a lecturer of a writing or 
language class, whose course is 
worth .75 , must teach twelve. 

Courseload equivalencies were 
determined by "the size of the 
class, the repetitiveness of the class 
and outside preparation, in order 
to avoid disparities among the 
departments ." Dr. Stanley 
Chodorow, Dean of Humanities 
said in an interview late January 
when the value of courses was 
being determined. 

T om Hull. assistant to the Vice 
Chancellor and spokesperson for 
the administration refused to 
comment on the fonnula which 
determined the .75 courseloads for 
writing classes. ~Because of the 
unfair labor charge filed by the 
union we feel that it would be 
unwise to say anything now," he 
said. 

No other UC has lower than a 
1.0 equivalency for writing courses 
and some have up to a 1.25 rating. 

Revelle Provost Thomas Bond 
said that the .75 rating of writing 
courses is justified. ~It's not fair to 
compare [to other UC 
universities]. The other schools 
have larger sections. You have to 
include the number of students in 
the section in any kind of 
calculation They (lecturers) may 
be teaching fewer classes but they 
are teaching more students," he 
said. 

Although the number of 
students 10 UC writing sections 
varies, the average enrollment IS 
about 25 students. UCSD averages 
between 12 and 15- students. 

"Teaching the same course three 
times a week to 20 people. or four 
times a week to 15 people hardly 
makes any difference in the work a 
lecturer has to do. I think it [the 
grievance I is ndiculous ." ProvOSt 
Bond said. 

One writing lecturer, who 
wi hed to remain anonymous for 
fear of lOSing his job. has 
consolidated one of his classes 
without the approval of the 
administration . 

"1 think the administration is 
going to raise holy hell [over course 
consolidations] and it is a 
senseless thing because I'm not 
teaching any less number of 
students. [Dean] Chodorow, [Vice 
Chancellor] Ticho and others 
unfortunately don't see it this way." 
the lecturer said . 

Currently the administration 
does not allow the lecturers to 
combine theIr classes to make 
larger sections so they can teach 
Ie s classe . 

Assistant Vice Chancellor Hull 
refu ed to comment on the 
po ibility of combining ewon .

campus foundations - one at each of 
eight campuses and rwo at UC Irvine -
that solicit donations from private 
sources The revised policy was 
prompted in part by a University audit 
of the UC Santa Sarbara foundation . 

Since 1987, the University'S overall 
reve nue from fund -raiSing increased 
from $79.5 million to $255 million in 
1985-86. In 1978-79, 20 percent of that 
revenue came through the efforrs of 
campus fo undations. The amount 
mcreased to 37 percent In 1985-86.

are willing to work with the club in 
order to se t up a post which would 
be open to both male and female 
students. 

However, Dean notes that it is 
important to realize the club does 
have the support of the Campus 
Recreation regarding their efforts. 
In a memo to Chadwell, Dean 
emphasized that· ... the club has 
followed all the proper procedures 
concering the construction and 
supervision of this ramp. In no way 
should they be criticized for their 
actions. I take full responsibility for 
the existence of the ramp and I am 
in hopes that we can aggreSSively 
pursue a way to keep this ramp on 
campus. It represents much 
student time and effort and 
provides a needed service" Dean 
also stated that "Diana (C hadwell) 
would like to see the facility stay if 
they can get through the 

HAIRCUTS 

problems." 
Dean pointed out that R.T.5. had 

only rwo choices regarding the 
construction of the ramp. The first 
possibility was to use the proper 
channels and obtain approval of 
the administration . Dean also 
explained that gaining approval 
could take up to several months (if 
at all) and sometimes it is better to 
take a more direct approach. This 
direct approach was the club's only 
other option when they voted to go 
ahead with the project. The 
members felt mat because they had 
already put in so much energy into 
fund raising and organization. the 
ramp should be built and the club 
given a chance to prove itself. 

All ramp materials and labor 
were provided by club members. 
who donated time and money for 
the project. Valued at an estimated 
$2,000, this is entirely a student 
project with the active support of 
Campus Recreation, No university 
funds went into the project.

Club members also feel the 
advantages of having a ramp on 
campus far outweigh the possible 
negative aspects. They are willIng 
to do anything to keep the ramp, 
even if it means chainsawing it 
into sections and hauling it to 
another location on campus. 

Security of the ramp is 
important to keep out non-insured 
skaters. The club members have 
installed two thick chains which 
run across the width of the ramp at 
the bottom of each side of the "U". 
The chains are cemented to the 
ramp which make it impossible for 
any skati ng to take place. 12 "core" 
members of R.T.s. have keys and 
are responsible for keeping the 
chains locked. 

Commenting on the safety 
aspect, Dean illustrated the fact 
that student participation in 
skateboard ramp activities are no 
more dangerous than other 
accepted sports on campus such as 
rugby, lacross, gymnastiCS and 

sc uba diving. etc. 
According to Third student, 

Russell Johnson , the ramp is 
a tually a safer place to practice 
than the campus or street and 
provides a suitable outlet for their 
talents . " In a controlled 
atmosphere , there are bener 
condi tions geared towards safety. 
Street skaters generally don 't wear 
protective gear and run higher 
risks of collision " 

Revelle Senior Gem Noble also 
pointed out that after "skating the 
ramp, I and other members had no 
energy (or need) to skate on 
campus." Muir Sophomore Jocko 
Snodgrass agreed and said "We 
need a place to workout and the 
ramp is ideal. The ramp IS 
beauti fic !" 

R. T.s. has over 75 members who 
participate in meetings and club 
ac ti vities. Plans for "Demos" 
(skating exhibitions) in order to 
raise money for chari ty are 
projected for next year. "RAMP-

International Center. 

It is encouragmg to - see a 
compromise emerge from the 
dispute of the skateboard ramp on 
university property. Both sides are 
being cooperative and the 
administration seems to be willing 
to acknowledge the time and effort 
put into this project by the 
students. A meeting has been 
scheduled for next week with 
representatives from the Business 
Office and the Associated Students 
and Villarreal. 

The largest hurdle left for R.T.S. 
is the ramp's appraisal by Physical 
Plant. who must inspect it for 
proper construction. Thirty-six 
feet in length , 10 feet high , and 20 
feet wide, the structure IS solId and 
carefully built. The skaters are 
proud of its stability and are 
hopeful for the future of their ramp.

Part two 

The plight of the forgotten people 
By BIUCK MOOMCHI 
Editor's note: This IS part two oj a 
three part series outlining solutions to 
the dilemma oj the homeless. 

Part three will appear next week. 
At dusk, a woman in her 60s, 

pushing her belongings in a 
shoppping cart was searchmg fora 
place to spend the night. ThiS was 
by the fancy seCtion of the 
downtown area. he looked so lost. 
lifeless and hopeless . A 
horrendously depreSSIng and 
disgraceful scene. The ene was 
conducive to raising the question. 
"is thiS the way to treat a human 
person in herold age1" and , "is this 
the way to set an example and 
create a role model for the youths 
regardmg how to treat the aged, 
what might happen to them if and 
when they grow old' ''. 

conclusion of all the major 
religions. Could 11 be that America 
too is becoming a rich, but not a 
prosperous nation? - a hallmark 
of underdeveloped and 
developing nations? Man)' more of 
these forgotten people have been 
observed and some have been 
interviewed In depth . None IS 
pleased WIth his/ her lot in hfe. 
They want help. Unfortuna tely, 
most do not have the capacity nor 
the inspiration to communicate 
about heir needs let alone 
obtaining them - not unlike 
children. This is clearly a brutal 
situation: and this brutality will 
come back to haunt us. 

for the homeless in San Diego 
County: 'To create a day center, to 
offer homeless men a safe haven 
from the meets during the 
daytime." The truth of the matter is 
that there are substantial numbers 
of women and children, not to 
mention entire families, belonging 
to this rank. More importantly, 
they need safe haven at night. 

This is perhaps a good example 
of how the bureaucracy has been 
dealing with the problem. In effect, 
they are saying "get rid of these 
bum , lest people think we have 
problems of this kind." In other 
words, "out of Sight, out of mind " 

Examination of such a proposal 
on the regional level on the one 
hand, and the recent armwlstmg 
by u.s. authorities to not release 
films on the United States' 
homeless to the United Nations 

Task Force on the homeless, attests 
to the fa t some people are not 
proud of the problem. This action 
has harmed and challenged the 
First Amendment Rights (Freedom 
of the Press), and the United States 
has been accused of cenSl)rship. 

A challenge of this nature during 
the Bicentennial of the U.S. 
Constitution poses some serious 
concerns. We have a moral,ethical 
and national obligation to provide 
immediate attention to it. We must 
also realize that there are greater 
dangers of psychological, socio-
political and economical 
ramifications if they are i~nored . 

The adverse psychological 
impacts of such atrocities could be 
very grave for the young. It could 
give rise to more delinquency: 
substance abuse, and hostility. It 
could culminate into a pessimistic 

outlook lowered respect for the 
authority, and a diminished sense 
of integrity, It could lead to even 
greater confusion in their belief 
and value systems. The impact on 
adults, at least unconsciously, may 
not be negligible either. The overall 
image about America both 
domestically and internationally 
could benefi t in the long run 
without the homeless problem. 

Biucl! Moomchi holds an M.5. in 
Counseling Psychology, has done 
doctoral worn in Health-Promotion 
and psychology. as well as post-
graduate worn on Substance Abuse. 
Death and Dying Perspectives and 
Clinical Hypnotheraw Currently, 
aside Jrom doing Needs Assessment pJ 
the Homeless, he is warning on a book 
on Optimizing Health: Coping 
With Catastrophes.

Despite the great need for

WIth intent to eradicate the 
problem. The following is the most

Re: Maura Visser, and anyone 
else like you out there: 

I've been working with olhers on 
thiS campus for some time to 
expose the iron fist beneath the 
velvet glove of the U.S. 
military/ corporate/ academic 
complex, and your letterin the May 
18 Gua rdian leaves me with but one 
question: how come I've never 
heard so much as a peep out of you 
untll now? If you really share our 
disgusl with the role of 
organizations like the FBI and CIA 
in helping the transnational 
co rporati ons to wri ng every last 
drop of profil from the bodies of 
the world's laborers, why aren't you 
out organIzing against this role 
instead of pouling on the 
sidelines? The ruthless snarling of 
those who know themselves to be 
our enemies, or the schizophrenic 
pot-shots of those who mistakenly 
believe themselves to be, are far 
more understandable than the 
petulant snivelli ngs of those who,

Editor: 

I would first like to thank 
Maura VIsser for taking the 
time to make her suggestions 
(Guardian , 5/ 18). I know it is 
difficult to criticize those with 
whom yo u agree, without 
experiencing some fear of 
being misunderstood. Although 
I represent myself in this 
letter/ response, after speaking 
with some of the people at 
the May 15 rally, I find many 
who are in agreement with 

my view. 
You suggest that " the 

painting on the side of Third 
Lecture Halls exhibited 
immaturity and lack of respect 
for public propeny," which in 
tum re£lects poorly on Kristen 
Crabtree's cause . I will not 
address the merits or harm of 
"graffi ti ," but draw your 
anention to the error in your 
logIC. You are presupposing 
that thi s individual act of 
self-expreSSion was sanctioned 
by the FBI / Crabtree arrest 
protest organizer s. The 
organizers and its members 
are limited m their jurisdiC-
tion of other individual or 
peripheral members. Given 
that the organizers are a loose 
coalmon of different student 
groups that all adhere to the 
prinCiples of democracy, it 
would be a totalitarian 
measure to re s tr ic t the 
members of the group from 
taking direct action.

handed OU t was full of 
"extremely vague condemnation 
of the FBI and CIA that was 
filled with overblown rhetoncal 
phrases: I refer you back to 
the flier that was handed out. 
How more specific could the 
flier have been than by 
refering to the CIA's involve-
ment in the overthrow of 
Allende in Chile, 1973, or to 
the Office of Public Safety, 
and the 1 nternational Police 
Academy, who's expressed 
purpose is to train foreign 
military and police forces? 
The Ilier specifically referred 
to the FBI's COINTELPRO 
program used in the 1960s to 
infiltrate and spy on domestic 
political organizations. 

The Ilier is difficult to 

accept not because of its 
inflammatory language but 
because it destroys our 
illusions about the infallabllity 
of our government and their 
strategies. We are taught that 
the United States is the only 
true democracy, so committed 
to those principles that we 
will insure democracy around 
the world. The contradictions 
appear when we become 
aware of how our government 
goes about accomplishing that 
goal. 

The flier also includes one 
section entitled "What Can

with my observations on a 
different but related matter. 
This is in regard to Brian 
Taylor's "A little Q &: An 
which appears In the same 
issue directly beneath Ms . 
Visser's letter to the editor. [ 
find It curious that Bnan 
Taylor printed four out of five 
opposing views on Il,e issue 
of no student fee 's to bring 
FBI, CIA and INS on campus. 
Given that an overwhelming 
majority of the student body 
voted in a referendum in 
April 1986, to disallow direct 
or indirect use of student fee 
mOnies to be used for these

MagicJohnson and friends 
to run camp at UCSD 
Coop, Thomas, Wilkins and Aguire will join the fun 
By GUSTAVO SANTOYO, StaffWnur 

It may sound unbelievable, but UCSD head coach Tom 
believe it the NBA's Most Valuable Marshall, who has worked in 
Player, Magic Johnson , and his several of Magic's camps in the 
buddies, the Detroit Pistons' Isiah past, said he talked with Magic 
Thomas, the human highlight film about bringing the camp to UCSD. 
Dominique Wilkins and the Dallas "Last year's camp was held at 
Mavericks' Mark Aguire will Occidental Ccllege and their 
converge on UCSD during the 

will be very successful ." 
Triton Pavillion will be the main 

venue where Magic will give 
instruction. Instruction will also 
take place in the Rec Gym, and the 
outdoor courts at Muir and Revelle. 

Argo Hall and one of the 

MagicJohnson Basketball Camp to 
be held July 12-16. 

Some of Magic's teammates on 
the Lakers , Including Michael 
Cooper and Navy basketball st.ar 
David Robinson, Will also take pan 
in the camp. Lakers' owner Jeny 
Buss and General Manager Jeny 
West may make a surpnse Visit. 

''The public ity for th is kind of event alone 
does wonders for the basketball program," 

- Tom Marshall 
UCSD basketball coach 

The deciSIOn to hold MagiC'S 
camp out of the Los Angeles area 
was not a hard one . ·We've had a 
lot of suppon from San Diego in 
the past ," said Lon Rosen , 
coordinator of th e Magi Johnson 
Basketball caml .. everal kids 
from the San Die!:.0 a rea come up to 
our camp each summer. and taking 
all things mto w nsJdera[ion , we 
thought San DIt." \ would be a great 
location for thiS ,.ear's camp." 

facilities were not nearly as good as 
ours: said Marshall "We have 
access to four indoor couns and 
SIX outdoor courts as well as 
fantaSiIC hOUSing accommoda-
tions. HIS people came down here 
a couple of months ago and they 
loved [he facilities." 

Rosen's assessment of UCSD's 
faCilities concurs WIth Marshall's 
"The facill(ies at UCSD are great," 
said Rosen. "We were really 
impressed when we went down 
there and we really think the camp 

mud huts on the Revelle campus 
WIll be used for housing 
accommodations. The Revelle 
cafeteria will provide the meals. 

Luring Magic and his friends on 
campus is, according to Marshall , a 
boost to the UCSD program. "The 
pubhcity for thIS kind of event 
alone does wonders for the 
baske[ball program ," said Marshall .

[he residence halls will pay $200 
whIle on-campus campers will 
shell out $400 for the camp. ~

But they weren't done yet. 
Christine Behrens and Nancy 
Calhoun had to start over again at 
noon in the indiVidual singles 
matches. Behrens also teamed with 
Rhonda Meier for the individual 
doubles matches. In their Singles 
matches, both Behrens (seeded 
second) and Calhoun (unseeded ) 
advanced to the quarter finals 
where they were forced to meet 
each other. Although a close 
match, Behrens was also playing 
on very painful shin splints which 
affected her game. "If she had been 
100 percent, she would have 
dominated. Next year should really 
be her year," said LaPlante. 
Calhoun had upset the number six

Meiers lost their doubles match in 
the first round , knocking them out 
of the competition~

A preview

*Art and Science. Diamet-
rical. Incongruous. As 19th 
century writer Claude 
Bernard commented , "Art is 
I: Science is We." The 
upcoming Undergraduate Art 
Exhibit offers a reconciliation 
between the arts and sciences 
at UCSD. This two-week 
affair encompasses a wide 
spectrum of the arts. From 
June 1-5 , the All -Student Art 
Exhibit will be presented' in 
the Mandeville Annex 
Gallery. This exhibition space 
will be open Monday through 
Friday from noon-5pm. 

The Undergraduate Art 
Exhibit is an exceptional 
opportunity for any UCSD 
student to showcase his or her 
work. This year, the exhibit 
consists of about 125 entries, 
from photographs and 
mobiles to sculptures and 
drawings. Because the exhibit 
is ope n to all UCSD 
undergraduates, the students 
involved co me from a 
diversity of majors - Physics, 
Biochemistry, Political 
Science - though most of the 
artists have taken Visual Arts 
courses. They have submitted 
their best work for display, 
and as this event is not a juried 
show I the entries will ran~e 
fr m introductory to senior 
work. All works submitted 
are put on display. 

"Let's face it. The arts have 
always been given a real 
downplay here at UCSD," 

noted B.J. Bar~lay, undergrad-
uate advisor for the Visual 
Arts Department. Barclay has 
coordinated the Undergrad~ 
uate Art Exhibit ·since its 
inception in 198 L 

In order to infuse art 
throughout UCSD, Barclay 
stated, "We have a tradition 
of presenting artwork in 
unusual places: elevators, 
classrooms, outdoors." She 
believes that art should be 
brought out to the campus, 
not only for the unique 
display of the student artists, 
but also to interest other 
students in viewing the work 
at the Mandeville Annex 
Gallery. Discounting the 
notion that Visual Arts is 
easier than any other major, 
Barclay points out that 
creating art takes just as much 
time and skill as other forms 
of learning, only in a different 
sense. 

This particular evt!nt is a 
major part of the annual 
UCSD Undergraduate Arts 
Festival. Of the U ndergrad-
uate Art Exhibit, Barclay 
challenged, "Th!:! main point 
is to draw attention to the arts, 
so that people will realize that 

. this is not just 1:1 science-
oriented school." 

'*one medium in particular 
whi h is not widely recognized 
In U SD's Visual Arts 
Department is media 
production. The Arts Festival 
enables students to 

which are not usually 
accessible to an open 
audience. This year's film 
festival includes 18 student 
films, both 16 mm and Super 
8. The festival occurs a t an 
opportune time, as the V.A. 
students have completed 
al most a full year's work . 

Many of the films 
submitted this year are 
products of the 16 mm film 
class offered at UCSD. The 
increase in films submittted 
can be attributed to the fact 
that this class was offered this 
quarter. 

Most of these films are first-
time endeavors, but for Rico 
Martinez, "Patients," is his 
third 16 mm film out of four 
entered. He has received a 
number of U.S. grants 
enabling him to make all of his 
films at least 15 minute 
longer than most student 
films. 

*Everything from half-
minute animations to 15 to 
20-minute documentaries will 
be featured in the video 
portion of the Undergraduate 
Arts Festival. The 8 12 hours of 
unrepeated videos will be 
screened in the North 
Conference Room located in 
UCSD's Student Center, May 
28 and 29 from noon to 5 pm. 

"All of the videos are made 
by students," video 
chairperson Mike Lapkin 
said. Lapkin, a Third College 

will have two of his videos 
shown. Lapkin stressed that 
"this is a festival. There will be 
no judging ." 

* All of the videos shown are 
produced on campus and are 
basically upper-division 
course work. Lapkin 
emphasized that this is a great 
opportunity for students to 
see other students' work. 

Lapkin expressed that all 
their forms of art are readily 
accessible to students, 
through concerts and art 
galleries on campus. Yet there 
is very little opportunity to 
see the video works of media 
and visual arts majors. 

"Media is becoming a very 
popular field," Lapkin said. 
"There is a definite need for 
the media department to 
expand. The media depart-
ment is where the media 
students spend "the majority 
of their lives," Lapkin said. 
"A video can take anywhere 
from five hours to six days 
straight to make. It's really a 
time consuming process. It's a 
lot of time, a lot of work, a lot 
of money, and a lot of fun." 

The making of a video 
involves pre-production, 
which involves making a 
script, storyboard, and 
shooting script, production, 
the actual shooting of video 
footage. and post-production, 
video and audio editing. "It 
reillly takes a lot of creative 

Lapkin explained. 

He hopes that the video 
portion of the Undergraduate 
Arts Festival will . help to 
further increase intt:rc.,t 
among other UCSD students . 

A reception will also be 
held on Friday, May 29 from 
3:30 to 5 pm. 
*A Supercomputer Wor-
shiper who believes it is a

Soulscape. Their next album 
Nite Train went even further,

graphers Pat Rincon and 
Melissa Nunn joined forces 
with their ideas for the 
production of the concert, 
recruiting Mullins to perform 
live.

of live jazz music and dance is

Directorial debut 
by michael brown 

A pair of San Diego State 
students conjured up an 
innovative idea to raise funds for 
their student film: present the 
student works of six prominent 
filmmakers. The result wa 
Friday and Saturday's " Back to 
School" program at the La Jolla 
Museum of Contemporary Art. 
While the dizzying joy of 
financing a student film for State 
students was enough for me, the 
program managed to be 
entertaining itself, even though 
who made the films was more 
interesting than the films 
themselves. 

Amblin, made by teven 
Spielberg in 1968, opened the 
program. While thi film is 
dated, it does exhibit Spielberg's 
flair for storytelling. A simple, 
well-told story with little depth, 
this film i a precursor to the 
format in which Spielberg ha 
become so prolifi . 

George Lucas' THX 1 131::l, a 
technically preci e and well-
polished film followed . The film 
was about a man 's escape from 
technology, but what made it 
intere ting wa how clearly it 

demonstrated Lu as' fascination 
with te hnology. Hi work often 
displays technologi al wizardry, 
but usually centers on an 
inclvidual overcoming tech -
nology, or any other obstacles, 
through internal strength. THX 
I 138 is an unadorned microcosm 
of Lucas' later works. 

The two shortest pieces were 
works by Martin Scorsese and 
Orson Welles. Scorsese's one-
act skit, where an idylli shave is 
interrupted by a nick and 
eventually turns into an orgy of 
blood. foretold the ominous 
tone that would later pervade his 
work . The stylish filming was 
infused with increasingly morbid 
black humor that prevented the 
film from becoming a gory one-
punch joke. 

Orson W elle' short was shot 
with a home movie camera and 
po sessed the choppy a-
cinematic quality indi ative of 
mo t home movies. As a result, 
Welles' heavy-handed theatri s 
and extensive use of symbolism 
dominated the piece. It 's an 
interesting example of Welles I

in a pure and unrefined form. 
Roman Polanski ' Two Men 

and a Wardrobe wa the only 
European w rk and had a 
di tinctively different style. 
With the verite look of Italian 
neo-realism, Polan ki told the 
tale of two men bringing a 
cumbersome wardrobe from the 
ocean and carrying it about a city. 
After a series of unpleasant 
episodes, they ported it back to 
sea. Hopefully, he didn'ttake the 
symbolism too seriously . 

The most innovative and well-
ani ulated film was The 
Grandmother by David Lynch, the 
director of Blue Velvet. As he has 
d ne in his well known films, 
Lynch creates a uniquely 
perverse cinematic world that 
uncovers the ugly sides of life. 
The Grandmother revolves 
around a young boy turning to 
memories of hi grandmother's 
love to es ape the hate of his 
parents. 

The film draws the audience 
into the boy's fantasy world 
through an innovative use of 
special effects. Deliberately long 
(annoyingly so) and rt·dundant 
in o rder to parallel the boy's 
mental state, the film was, 
neverthcle s, the most 
intere ting and memorable of the 
program.

she learned of a conflict; 
Nunn was also planning a 
concert featuring Mullins' 
music. Eventually the two 
decided to work together 
using Rincon's dance 
company. Recruiting Mullins 
was not as hard as it appears; 
he is Nunn's brother. When 
asked about working with 
Mullins, Rincon said, "We sat 
down with Rob and asked him 
how he felt about his music. 
Once we understood his 
feelings, we could figure out 
how we felt about the 
choreography." 

Mullins' style can be 
characterized as very different 
from traditional jazz acts. He 
likes to refer to his music as 
"instrumental pop." Most jazz 
acts rely on improvisational 
technique while Mullins' 
music is much more 
structured. This highlights his 
great versatility as a musician. 
Strict adherence to format has 
allowed for complex passages 

to work in a new way; he is 
able to switch fr m 
propul ive to dreamy within 
the same ' piece. The Rob 
Mullins Trio has performed 
for several years at the Regus 
Cafe in Denver where its 
music first gained its ever 
growing popularity. The band 
is currently playing at The 
Alley Cat Bistro in Los 
Angeles. 

The concert will feature 
selections from both of 
Mullins' albums. "Soul-
scape," "Bay Wolf Blues," 
and "Schroeder Meets Basie" 
have been choreographed by 
Rincon from the Soulscape 
album, and "Daybreak" and 
"Torpedoes on the Mouse-
trap," have been choreo-
graphed by Nunn from the 
Nice Street album. In between 
each number, the Mullins 
trio will be performing cuts 
from their unreleased album. 

The performance will be 
May 22 and 23 at the Lyceum 
Theater in Horton Plaza. 
Tickets are $12 for general 
admission, $9 for students, 
military and seniors.
