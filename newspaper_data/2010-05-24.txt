Fee Policy 
Raises New
Questions

<*�)<+.,;�*90:0:

The UC Board of Regents’ approval to revisions to the mandatory system reg-istration fees has raised concern that 
the money will be used for educational funding 
rather than servings its original purpose of fur-
thering student life. 

The registration fee — officially renamed 
the Student Services Fee, as 
of May 19 — exists within 
the UC Student Fee Policy, 
which also includes the sys-
temwide educational fee. 
The $300-per-quarter fee 
has traditionally funded 
student resources such as 
counseling and psychologi-
cal services, as well as some 
social activities.

The Student Fee Policy 
was last revised on Nov. 
19, 2009, when the regents 
voted to raise both the reg-
istration and educational fee 
by a total of 32 percent — leading to widespread 
student outcry, several protests and the March 
4 Day of Action, during which students across 
the nation rallied in support of public education. 

According to graduate student and 
Registration Fee Advisory Committee Chair Erik 
Van Esselstyn, the new guidelines for the Student 
Services Fee allow the money to be put toward 
non-service resources, such as funding enroll-

Existing within a system that weath-ered an $813 million drop in state funding last year — and facing 
another direct $7 million cut next year — 
the academic departments of UCSD rely on 
a delicately budgeted balance between uni-

versity money and grants toward research 
in the sciences and arts. 

Control of departmental funding begins 
in the UC Office of the President, then trick-
les down to the UCSD office of Academic 
Affairs, individual division heads and then 
department heads themselves. 

According to Chief Financial Officer 
for Academic Affairs Debbie McGraw, her 
office divides the university’s pool of funds 
— consisting of student fees, state funds 
and grants —  between five recipients: arts 
and humanities, physical sciences, biologi-
cal sciences, engineering and social sci-
ences.  The divisions each house individ-
ual departments — for example, arts and 
humanities is composed of the philosophy, 
literature, music, theatre and dance, visual 

arts, and history departments.
The size of each share varies by division 

and is reallocated every fiscal year. This 
year, Academic Affairs allocated approxi-
mately $36.4 billion among the divisions. 
Of this amount, about $6.1 million was 
allocated to the arts and humanities divi-
sion, $7.4 million to social sciences, $10.2 
million to engineering, $7.7 million to 
physical sciences and $5 million to biologi-
cal sciences. 

“Every department has a permanent 
support budget,” McGraw said. “That 
means that there is a certain amount of 
dollars that — unless someone comes to 
actively cut or add to it — they can count 

Final budget based on how 
much money each academic
division — such as humanities 
and biological sciences — 
receives from outside sources.

Registration fee committee, Office 
of the President disagree on the 
effect of revised $900 student fee.

The last Non-Sexist Dance of 
the year, hosted by UCSD LGBTQIA, 
abandoned its traditional Porter’s 
Pub venue in favor of the roomier 
Price Center Plaza. Over 600 people 
showed up for the event on Friday 
night, which — unlike all Non-Sexist 
Dances this year — did not reach 
capacity. 

Because a Non-Sexist Dance was 
cancelled in February due to the 
“Compton Cookout,” controversy, there 
were more funds available for this one-
time splurge on a larger, pricier venue.

However, event organizer James 
Small said the change is not perma-
nent. 

“We love Porter’s,” he said. “We 
have zero reason to want to leave.”

Next Fall Quarter, though, the dance 
will return to its usual home in Porter’s. 
Small added that the last dance of the 
year will likely continue to take place in 
its new location — hopefully allowing 
more students to participate in the 
bi-quarterly, queer-friendly bash.

on it every year. This is a budget that 
is specifically set for staff and for 
other support needs — telephones, 
supplies, supporting the class labs.”

McGraw said Academic Affairs 
bases its allocations on factors such 
as the number of faculty members 
in each division, the number of stu-
dents enrolled in each division and 
the amount of outside grant support 
the divisions receive. 

Of all the undergraduates on 
campus, only 9 percent have not 
declared a major. Thirty-six percent, 
on the other hand, have chosen the 
social-science division — the largest 
of the divisions, home to 342 faculty 
members. The arts-and-humanities 
division contains 276 faculty and 8 
percent of undergraduates, whereas 
engineering has 226 faculty mem-
bers and 18 percent of undergradu-
ates.  The physical-science division 
has 255 faculty members and 9 
percent of undergraduates, whereas 
biological science has only 88 fac-
ulty members but 20 percent of the 
undergraduates.

Divisional funding is also heavily impacted by grant activity, since the science 
divisions are much more likely to 
bring in non-state funds.

Unlike the funds allocated by 
the university, grant money is gifted 
to individual faculty members or 
research groups who seek funding 
from outside sources.

Last year, as illustrated in the 
graph on page one, the grant activ-
ity total was only $360,000 for arts 
and humanities and $2.9 million for 
social sciences, whereas engineer-
ing received $46.1 million in grants, 
physical sciences received $28.5 mil-

lion and biological sciences received 
$22.7 million. 

McGraw said that another factor 
Academic Affairs takes into account 
is need — for example, the engineer-
ing department receives the most 
outside funding, but it also receives 
the most divisional funding because 
of the high cost of computers, soft-
ware and other equipment that the 
arts and humanities department 
might not need. 

“Special fac-
tors that we look 
at include the sci-
ences, which have 
lab courses that 
drive certain costs, 
and the arts, which 
have performances 
that drive certain 
costs,” McGraw 
said. “We try 
to compare one 
against another 
when we figure out 
how much money 
to give or cut.”

If grants are 
taken into account, 
the amount a divi-
sion receives from 
Academic Affairs 
is often an inaccurate estimation of 
the overall money that departments 
are receiving. 

“Arts and humanities has the 
three humanities departments — lit-
erature, history and philosophy — 
and they have three art departments: 
theater, visual arts and music,” 
McGraw said. “They have very com-
plicated staffing needs to support 
their productions. So if you look at 
humanities versus arts, there’s not 
the same funding across the board. 
The humanities do have less. And 

they don’t have contracts and grants 
to manage. They don’t have costly 
laboratories.”

According to McGraw, once all 
these factors are taken into account, 
each division receives a fair amount 
of funding every year. 

Once funds are allocated to the divisions, the dean of each division then evalu-
ates similar factors — like the num-

ber of faculty members, 
the number of students 
enrolled in that divi-
sion and the amount of 
outside grants provided 
— within his or her area 
to decide how to allo-
cate money to individual 
departments. 

“The departments go 
through a similar pro-
cess: They look at work-
load, what needs are, 
how many enrollments 
and how many majors,” 
McGraw said. “They try 
to blend it together.”

According to 
Associate Vice Chancellor 
for Undergraduate 
Education Barbara 

Sawrey, the Office of Academic 
Affairs sets aside money for each 
department’s faculty and teaching-
assistant salaries, but otherwise does 
not control how the divisions allo-
cate the remaining funds. 

“Academic Affairs provides fund-
ing to the departments, but it is the 
departments that determine how to 
set their own spending priorities,” 
Sawrey said. “We do not manage the 
expenditures.”

Arts and Humanities Assistant 
Dean Heath Fox said department 

allocations are very rigid, as there 
are certain pools of money that must 
be used for certain purposes, such 
as office supplies. To allocate the 
remaining money, the dean consid-
ers factors such as enrollment levels 
and varying numbers and requests 
of faculty members in each depart-
ment.

Although Academic Affairs sets 
money aside for salaries, teaching 
assistants and supplies, the deans 
take care of more curriculum-related 
expenses — like paying for servic-
es such as temporary lecturers. He 
added that deans gauge the “need” 
for certain services as requested by 
faculty. 

“We are guided by the faculty 
in the department and what they 
articulate as the need,” Fox said. 
“That’s the biggest factor: what sup-
port requirements the departments 
have. And the second biggest factor 
is going to be the total amount of 
money that’s available in different 
funding categories. Those are basi-
cally the two things that will guide 
all the funding decisions.”

McGraw said she is unsure of how 
academic divisions will be funded in 
the 2010–11 fiscal year, considering 
the budget cut of $7 million she said 
will be implemented next year.

“We’re trying to figure out how 
to allocate a budget cut of about 
$7 million dollars,” McGraw said. 
“Seven million is a big number, and 
we’re kind of looking at three years 
in the future. Whatever number each 
division gets cut, we’re going to give 
them time to achieve it. Still, it’s 
going to be a cut they’re all going to 
have to take.”

21�&$0386�³�Just three days after the Sun 
God Festival — as we all grasped to fading memo-
ries of freedom — came a buzz kill for the books: 
The UCSD Native American Student Alliance 
released a statement condemning those who had 
decorated themselves with face paint, feathers and 
headdresses on the day of the festival.

According to NASA, the students’ faux-tribal 
attire — aside from degrading Native-American 
tradition — contributed to negative cultural ste-
reotypes on campus.

“As students at UCSD we should not have to 
see our cultures mocked and ridiculed during a 

student sponsored event taking place at our uni-
versity,” the alliance said in an online statement.

It’s no doubt that, after Winter Quarter’s 
“Compton Cookout” fiasco, the UCSD student 
population could use a lesson or two in cultural 
sensitivity. The frat-planned party that mocked a 
disadvantaged California community — followed 
by a string of other racist events — warranted 
immediate response from the Black Student 
Union, and demonstrated a dire need for educa-
tional and outreach efforts. 

The case of the Sun God headdress, however, 
is a different story. First off, as a Sun God celebra-

tor who peppered her hair with gold feathers the 
day of, I’d argue many costumed students never 
intended to emulate traditional American-Indian 
dress, but rather the aesthetic of the statue itself.

The festival’s winged inspiration, after all, was 
created by artist Nikki St. Phalle’s indigenous 
handbrush. Even with all artistic classification 
aside, it’s still a bird splashed in primary colors — 
perfectly crowned with a row of gold feathers.

Maybe there were a handful of Sun God 
enthusiasts who, after downing a few shots on the 

When Students Cry ‘Cookout’

Dear Editor, 
Your abysmal coverage of Justice in 

Palestine Week and the Horowitz fias-
co reeks of Hearstian and Horowitzian 
journalism.

While you sought to clarify my 
answer in your May 20 article entitled 
“Students Clash Anew Over Israeli-
Palestinian Conflicts,” you chose not 
to qualify it with my position. I will 
do you a favor and quote it from my 
statement directly. “My opinion of 
Hamas is not as simple as condemn or 
condone, for it or against it. I firmly 
believe that the killing of civilians, 
even as collateral damage regardless of 
creed, politics, sexuality, nationality or 
ethnicity is one of the highest crimes 
in the eyes of God and is morally rep-
rehensible and abhorrent.”

Secondly, Hezbollah is not a 
Palestinian faction — it is Lebanese. 
Hamas (regardless of its designa-
tion as a terrorist organization by 
Israel and the U.S.) is neither geno-
cidal nor Holocaust-denying. This 
is simply evident in Yale University’s 
copy of Article 20 of the Covenant 
of the Islamic Resistance Movement, 
which analogizes Israel’s treatment 
of Palestinians to Nazi treatment of 
Jews, and Article Six, which calls for 
the establishment of a Palestinian state 
where people of all religions can coex-
ist in peace. Your fact-checking should 
at least consist of Googling either 
organization’s name.

Young Americans for Freedom 
chairwoman Gabriella Hoffman is 
quoted saying that she feels hurt that 
I would want to kill her and other 
Jews. Barzilay claims that the apartheid 

wall makes her feel “alienated” and 
demands that I apologize. These indi-
viduals have no right to speak of hurt, 
alienation or apology whatsoever. It 
was Hoffman, acting as chair of Young 
Americans for Freedom, who invited 
and introduced David Horowitz. It 
was Barzilay’s organization, Tritons for 
Israel, which initially tri-sponsored the 
event and had many of its members in 
attendance. Those students were not 
threatened or preoccupied by my sup-
posed “racist” sentiments. When I left, 
one member followed me out, brushed 
aside my attempts at clarification and 
admitted that she knew I had misspo-
ken, given Horowitz’s reputation.

Horowitz was not invited to pres-
ent any argument or engage in con-
structive dialogue — rather, he was 
brought because of his reputation for 
racism and hatemongering against 
Arabs and Muslims. If anyone can 
claim alienation or marginalization, 
it’s me. For the university to allow him 
to set foot on my campus using my 
student fees is a slap in my face and a 
slap in the face of all other non-Jewish 
minorities on this campus. Need more 
proof? Google this article: “Guns Don’t 
Kill Black People, Other Blacks Do.” 
Tell me: Who needs to apologize now?

As far as the sense of “alienation” 
that the apartheid wall heralds: The 
panels and speakers criticized the 
Israeli government, not the Jewish 
people. Professors and lecturers at this 
university urge us to examine our own 
government. Why should the universi-
ty or A.S. Council entertain the notion 
that the Israeli government is holier 
than our own and beyond reproach?

The voices of the Palestinian peo-
ple have been silenced by the main-
stream media for too long, and I refuse 
to silence my own voice to appease the 

twisted politics of the pro-Israel com-
munities on and off campus.

Dear Editor,
It disgusts and saddens me that a 

Palestinian student at UCSD has to 
defend herself against the wordplay 
of Horowitz and is being blamed for 
supporting genocide, while her own 
people are suffering from acts of racial 
violence on the scale of genocide on a 
daily basis. Only at UCSD could such 
a backward discussion be made into 
headline news. The entire situation 
was instigated by Tritons For Israel, 
who purposely invited a hateful, anti-
Palestinian figure to speak at UCSD 
during Justice in Palestine Week. 
What’s next, KKK speakers during 
Black History Month? One of the first 
lessons in critical race theory is that 
counterattack — blaming the victim 
— is a common strategy for avoiding 
blame, and it’s used by people commit-
ting acts of racism just as it is used by 
perpetrators of domestic violence.

As an alumnus of UCSD who is 
now a lecturer here, I want to make 
my support for Palestine clear. When 
students ask how much money is 
spent on Justice in Palestine Week, 
even though they may not understand 
its importance, I have to ask how 
much money is spent on support for 
Israel on this campus. How much 
money goes to developing nuclear 
weapons, and how much money goes 
to animal testing? There are a whole 
host of things on this campus that I 
don’t agree with, but the purpose of 

a university is to provide a space for 
intellectual inquiry, and to open stu-
dents’ minds to the injustice of their 
own society. Spending a few thousand 
dollars bringing to light the crimes of 
the No. 1 recipient of military aid from 
the U.S. is an excellent way to spend 
money, in my view.

That the article “Students Clash 
Anew Over Israeli-Palestinian 
Conflict” called into question the qual-
ity of the speakers is a further insult. 
Angela Davis, a world-renowned 
scholar, activist and alumna of UCSD, 
was only one of the brilliantly chosen 
speakers who the Muslim Student 
Association — in all its hard work — 
brought to our campus.

To quote the Mexican-American-
studies department of the Tucson 
Unified School District, our goal here 
should be to “work toward the invok-
ing of a critical consciousness within 
each and every student” and “promote 
and advocate for social and education-
al transformation.” Justice in Palestine 
Week is one of the most important 
events our campus holds annually, and 
it should get more funding instead of 
less, in light of the growing racial intol-
erance this campus is supporting.

Biased Against Palestine

Justice for Palestine Week 
Should Receive More Funds

Since my only-child upbringing exhausted any need for attention a decade ago, I’m not usually one 
to ask for cheap pity. In the hope that 
I might spare others such a harrowing 
fate, though, I’ll share my story: Last 
weekend, I sustained an injury. A seri-
ous one. The kind that makes you beg 
mercy from whatever cruel, senseless 
higher power has left you with insom-
nia and a burning red rash (on the 
shoulder, sicko). 

Though I am no doctor, I’m 
reasonably sure I know where the 
problem started. After spending a rare 
Saturday in a tank top under the sun, 
I later awoke with a sore shoulder. 
Having been born — as some cultur-
ally insensitive individuals call my 
kind — a “ginger,” I’m no stranger to 
the phenomenon of the sunburn. But 
I was also certain my pus-covered 
shoulder was no mere sunburn. 
Sunburns don’t keep you up all night, 
and they definitely don’t ooze deadly 
fluids. 

Twenty minutes of WebMD.com 
research later, I arrived at an alarming 
self-diagnosis that did little to alleviate 
my fears. Apparently, if one remains 
under the sun for an extended period 
of time without any protection, he 
becomes subject to something called 
“sun poisoning” — a term I still do not 
entirely understand, but nevertheless 
frightened me into making good on 
the site’s suggestion to consult a doctor. 

In what must have been a personal 
record, I arrived at Student Health a 
full 10 minutes before it opened. There 
I stood in line behind an assembly of 
snifflers and wheezers. God, I thought, 
What a luxury to have such a treatable, 
obvious condition as a common cold.

Once the doors opened, it was a 
mad dash to the urgent-care recep-
tionist, but I managed to fill out the 
requisite form with lightning precision. 
“Severe rash on shoulder,” I reported, 
“Since Saturday.” I resisted the urge 
to underline for dramatic effect. The 
statement spoke for itself. 

Upon rehashing the salient details 
of my story to the doctor — overexpo-
sure to the sun; insomnia; enormous, 
pus-filled welts — I was asked to kindly 
remove my shirt so that “we” could 
have a better look. 

After a thorough 10-second 
examination, the good doctor had 
arrived at his diagnosis: It was, in 
strict medical terminology, a ... sun-
burn. Or, more specifically, a blister-
ing sunburn — which would account 
for the menacing pockets of air lining 
my shoulder. 

We sat in awkward silence as the 
doctor tried his best not to make light 
of my hysteria, typing up a two-page 
treatment plan with such eye-opening 
recommendations as “wear longer 
shirts, use hats and apply sunscreen.”

When — in a final attempt at 
proving my sensibility — I asserted 
that I’d never suffered such a pain-
ful reaction to the sun, the doctor 
mentioned that such inexperience 
was probably symptomatic of a larger, 
graver life circumstance: “generally 
good parenting.”

Thank you, Mom and Dad, for 
slathering me in sunscreen every day 
of elementary school. Maybe next 
time, though, I’ll wait another day or 
two before braving the doctor’s office. 
I’d hate for my next diagnosis to be 
hypochondria.

OPINION� MONDAY, MAY 24, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

THE RIVETER By Ronnie Steinitz

For More Than a Chancellor’s Nod, Choose Your Battles
eve of the festival, thought it’d be fun 
to throw on their old “Pocahontas” 
costumes, but most of us were paying 
respect to the festival’s namesake. If 
our beloved party God also happens 
to remind a small group of students 
of their cultural heritage, cool — the 
more, the merrier.

But even if we’re talking about 
those who did aim to sport some 
Sioux-inspired gear because they 
thought it looked cool, it’s unclear 
why that would be classified as mock-
ery. If students had decked themselves 
in moccasins and paint and skipped 
around howling a sarcastic war cry, 
I’d say we had another Cookout on 
our hands. But, seeing as they were 
simply borrowing from the culture’s 
style because they think it’s awesome, 
it seems like more of a case of flattery 

in the form of imitation. America is 
a melting pot of heritage and tradi-
tion; many a white boy has donned 
a kurta to demonstrate respect for 
the Indian culture, or a toga for the 
Greeks. While American-Indians 
have faced especially violent hard-
ship in the U.S. — which shouldn’t be 
downplayed — that doesn’t take away 
a collective right to appreciate their 
art and culture.

NASA argued that these acts “are 
a product of the ever-diminishing 
Native American presence on UCSD,” 
and demanded administrators up edu-
cation and outreach in response. 

While there are indeed pressing 
reasons to boost the American-Indian 
presence on campus, NASA is hurt-
ing its case by singling out these 
arbitrary incidents. Isolating students 
— who, in their decision to plaster 

their bodies with paint and feathers, 
were not acting out of ignorance, but 
celebration — will only alienate those 
who are otherwise on NASA’s side. 
Unfortunately, as was the case with last 
quarter’s Cookout controversy, unless 
a minority group can communicate its 
reasons for upset clearly to the rest of 
the clued-out campus, its message will 
sound like nothing more than a whine 
to those who need to hear it most. 

So pick your battles, and we’ll stick 
with you when they’re worth fighting. 
But if you keep crying “Cookout” at 
every turn, all you’ll ever get is a string 
of e-mails from Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox’s PR slaves detailing the 
importance of cultural sensitivity until 
we’re completely desensitized.

After winning the Miss USA pageant on May 16, Lebanese 
immigrant Rima Fakih has since expe-
rienced a flood of backlash from critics 
who say that because she’s Muslim, she 
doesn’t accurately represent America 
— and that her ties with a terrorist 
nation make her title undeserved.

In particular, Fakih has received 
conservative backlash over her name 
— which a few Hezbollah officials 
allegedly share. Radical pundits like 
columnist Debbie Schlussel have 
fueled an absurd rumor that Fakih is a 
terrorist, which birthed the unoriginal 
nickname “Miss Hezbollah.” 

The suspicion that Fakih has 
anything to do with Hezbollah is 
embarrassing to our collective national 
intelligence. Claiming that her last 
name ties her to a militant group is on 
par with the assumption during World 
War II that every Japanese citizen was 
an enemy.

Fakih’s story — which helped 
to make this year’s string of candi-
dates more representative of modern 
America than that of the blond-haired, 
blue-eyed, Stepford-in-training run-
ner-up — offers a refreshing perspec-
tive on what it means to be American. 
She was not chosen, as critics have 
alleged, based on affirmative action, 
but on the competition’s true prerequi-
sites — however shallow they may be. 

In the end, Fakih wowed the judges 
with a stock interview and bikini bod. 
That’s not to say bestowing national 
honors based on superficial attributes 
is a good thing, but — by design — 
the Miss USA pageant is one instance 
where politics and religion should take 
a backseat to stunning evening dresses 
— and, of course, legs for days.

—Margaret Yau
Contributing Writer

Although this year’s Miss USA winner is the first Muslim or 
Lebanese-American to boast the 
crown — which may help shift per-
ceptions of what the girl next door 
should like in the U.S — that victory 
means nothing inside a tradition 
as rigged and biased as a national 
pageant.

In Fakih’s defense, her resume is 
a far cry from last year’s Miss USA 
winner, Kristen Dalton — a blue-
eyed blonde with nothing more than 
a North Carolina high-school diplo-
ma to her name. Fakih, on the other 
hand, graduated from the University 
of Michigan with a degree in eco-

nomics and 
business 
management, 
and has plans 
to attend law 
school in the 
future. 

But while 
Miss USA 
2010 may 
be a more 
well-rounded 
baton-twirler 
than her 
predeces-
sors, Fakih’s 
newfound 

fame still exists inside a superficial 
industry that emphasizes — above all 
else — the importance of light skin, 
meticulous hair and an anorexic 
bikini bod. 

Though her victory may have 
taken a small step toward reshaping 
the cookie-cutter ideal of American 
beauty, it only means so much on 
such firmly-planted pillars of sexism.

ment and admissions services, finan-
cial aid administration and campus 
libraries. 

However, a 2002 document from 
the UC Council on Student 
Fees — which consists of 
the chairs of the Council 
of Student Fees at each of 
the campuses — listed all 
these areas as inappropriate 
recipients of registration-
fee funds. 

Van Esselstyn said the 
fee’s new flexibility is det-
rimental to student life. 

“The registration fee 
is not supposed to be 
used for libraries or state-
funded programs,” Van 
Esselstyn said. “They’re 
separate from education 
fees for a reason, and stu-
dents pay these fees so 
that it can come back to 
them in the form of ser-
vices.”

However, according to 
UC spokesperson Peter 
King, the reclassification of the fee 
will increase accountability for stu-
dent-fee allocation as a whole. 

“It’s essentially a name change, 
but the change was motivated by a 
desire to remove any doubt about 
where the students’ registration fees 
were being spent,” King said. “There 
had been some concern expressed 
by students and others that the 
monies generated were being 
applied to other purposes beyond 
student services. This clarifies they 
are not.”

A.S. President Wafa Ben Hassine 
agreed with King that the revision is 
a positive one. 

“From what I’ve heard, from 
UCSA and all sources, they say it’s 
just a name change to make it more 
transparent,” Ben Hassine said. “I 
would not support this if it paid for 
libraries or administrative services.” 

The Student  Services Fee pol-
icy now requires each campus to 
maintain a website providing 
details on how registration fees are 
spent.  Additionally, chancellors for 
individual campuses are now required 
to annually solicit and consider stu-
dent opinion on the amount of the 
fee; these recommendations will then 
be considered by the Council on 
Student Fees. 

“It’s a really good change,” Ben 
Hassine said. “It increases transpar-
ency as to where the student ser-
vice fees are going, since students 
had been suspecting that it was used 
for other things. Also, changing the 
name to student service fee makes it 
more specific.”

However, Van Esselstyn has main-
tained that the recent change allows 
administrators to expand the scope 
of the Student Services Fee, which  
would contradict the purpose of hav-
ing two separate fees — one for edu-
cation and one for student services.

“Distinguishing these two fees 
has a purpose,” Van Esselstyn said. 
“These fees were designed so that in 
these circumstances, when budget 
cuts occur, we still retain these stu-
dent resources on campus. Because 
college isn’t just about education — 
it’s about the experience as well. This 
is blurring the distinction and taking 
out of two pockets instead of one.” 

Van Esselstyn said an alternative 
to redirecting student-service funds 
would be to raise the education fee 
and lower the Student Services Fee so 
that the total amount would remain 
the same. 

Because the Student Services Fee 
can be considered a “new” fee, he said 
it is possible that previous documents 
ensuring the oversight of the registra-
tion fee will now be ignored. 

“One of the tactical advantages 
of defining the fee with a new name 
is that the history of the fee under 
the old name becomes more difficult 
to associate with its current usage,” 
Esselstyn said. 

Former Marshall College Council 
Senator and Registration Fee 

Advisory Committee member Brian 
McEuen said the new policy unfairly 
allows the university to funnel money 
away from the fee’s intended recipi-
ents. 

The UCSD admin-
istration already has a 
history of drawing from 
the registration-fee fund 
for academic purposes. 
In an October 20, 2009 
article, graduate student 
Garo Bournoutian said 
that over $1 million in 
student registration fees 
had been reallocated 
from student services to 
compensate for a lack 
of adequate academic 
funding. 

“Before, [the fee] 
couldn’t be used for 
curricular things, and 
anything to do with the 
educational mission,” 
McEuen said. “It’s very 
shady that this is hap-
pening, and it shouldn’t 
be happening.”

The new Student Services Fee 
policy will go into effect beginning 
Fall Quarter 2010.

emolishing $2,000 worth of electronic equipment 
isn’t normally a cause for celebration. But for the 25 
students on UCSD’s Triton Robotix team — lead by 
Warren College sophomore Daniel Yan and Sixth 
college senior Allen Jiang, it’s all in a hard day’s work. 

After competing on the television show “Battle Bots” last 
April, Yang and Jiang, a fourth year from Sixth College, hit the 
road with 12 other members of Robotix, a 120-pound robot 
and two three-pound mini robots. They drove to San Mateo, 
Calif., to compete in this year’s Robogames competition — an 
annual weekend showdown between robots from Canada, 
Puerto Rico and Brazil. At the end of the three-day battle, 
Robotix emerged fifth out of 21 competitors.

“We’re really excited to have been in the top 20 percent 
internationally,” Jiang said.  

The club was started two years back as an outlet for stu-
dent engineers who wanted practical training at a university 
that, according to Yang, is predominantly hands-off in its 
teaching methods.

“We have very few opportunities to try things,” Yang said. 
“We just study. This gives you a chance to experiment with 
things you learn; although a majority of it is that we like to 
engineer things, and we like to engineer things that destroy 
other things.”

And on the destroying front, Kraken — Triton Robotix’s 
middle-weight-class robot — has been pretty successful. 
Between 10 club members, The metal droid took six to eight 
months to plan and build, spread over 12 in six-hour build 
sessions. 

“We started off with raw material and just built it up,” Yang 
said. “But not the electrical part, because we’re not electrical 
engineers. We buy the electrical components, but everything 
still had to be connected together.”

According to Jiang, a surprisingly large chunk of the $2,000 
it took to build Kraken went to spare parts, which the team 
needs on hand in case of a malfunction. 

“The materials have to be strong and robust,” Jiang said. 
“We have to buy extra motors and batteries in case they fail.”

Going into the competition, Kraken’s battle strategy was 
to ram other robots into submission and immobilize them. 
Equipped with four-wheel drive and a linear actuator — a 
motor that controls the robot’s front shield, which is made out 
of abrasion-resistant steel — Kraken would be able to lower 
the shield under its opponents and then lift and immobilize 
them by running them into a wall.

“If you think of a game of rock, paper, scissors — we’re a 
rock robot; we’re built really solid,” Yang said. “We’re really 
tough and hard to destroy. Our goal is to ram them, break 
their weapon — then lift them and immobilize them.”

The blueprint stages for Kraken began Week Three of Fall 
Quarter 2009. As the final model was completed a mere day 
before the April 22 competition, the team had only enough 
time for a few trial runs before Kraken’s first battle.

“Last year, we tested it at the competition,” Yang laughed. 
“We’re already doing better than last year.”

Though they finished in the nick of time this year, the 
team still encountered a roadblock before the competition. For 
every four players traveling to the arena to participate, there 
needed to be one robot — or each additional person would

U CSD alumna and Surf eCo founder Torrey Trust never planned to get rich quick. In fact, after graduat-ing with a major in visual arts and media from UCSD 
three years ago, Trust has yet to pursue a job within in her 
field of study. Instead, she has dedicated her time to saving

While studying at UCSD, Trust worked as the recreation 
department’s first-ever female surf instructor. During that 
time, when the surf program was still in its infantile stages, 
she helped develop both an eight-week lesson plan and the 
all-female “Wahine” class that still exists today. 

Combining her experience at UCSD Recreation with a 
passion for sustainability, Trust founded Surf eCo in 2007. 
Based in Encinitas, the school integrates beach clean-ups and 
environmental lectures into its traditional surf lessons. Most 
of Trust’s classes outline how students can learn to be more 
aware of their carbon footprint while going about their daily 
lives. 

At the end of a session, participants receive goodie bags 
with biodegradable wax, reusable towels made from bamboo 

and green-tea sunscreen. 
“Starting Surf eCo was just my way of raising money and 

awareness about deforestation,” Trust said. “People can’t 
imagine that the things they do — like eating a hamburger 
or throwing away a plastic bag — can have such a negative 
effect on the environment.” 

Trust has taken it upon herself to ensure that eco-friendly 
practices are incorporated into all aspects of her business. 
She uses green surfboards, made from bio-foam planks 
wrapped in a thin layer of squishy, boogie-board-esque 
foam. She said her own Earth-friendly creativity has inspired 
her students to be aware of their environmental impact as 
well. 

“After the first week of lessons, everyone showed up with 
reusable water bottles and Trader Joe’s bags for wetsuits,” 
Trust said, laughing. “A year later, a mom told me that her 
son still bugged her to reuse plastic bags.” 

Trust credits her father — a fellow surfer and environ-
mental-science teacher for high schoolers — for instilling in 
her the urgent attention to sustainability. Recently, she said, 
he managed to raise $10,000 with his class toward prevent-
ing tropical deforestation. However, it wasn’t until her own 
honeymoon in Costa Rica that Trust said she saw for herself 
what arboreal destruction really looked like. 

“Half of the trees had been cut down on over 50 acres [of 
the Osa Peninsula],” she said.

When she returned to California, inspired by her travels, 
Trust founded Surf eCo. In its first year, the company was 
so successful that Trust was able to pay back her startup 
costs and save approximately 75 acres through donations to 
the Nature Conservancy (a leading nonprofit organization 
that protects “ecologically important lands and waters”). 
According to Trust, most large-sum donors to the Nature 
Conservancy are over 65 years old — something she has 
been working to change.

Though it started with quite a bang in 2007, Surf eCo 
soon met several setbacks. According to Trust, a handful of 
members from the tight-knit Encinitas surf community have 
responded negatively to her surf lessons, believing that she 
intended to teach them at the popular surf break known as 
Swamis. In actuality, she said, the lessons ran further down 
the beach, where she has “never seen anyone surf — ever.” 

Then, in 2008, without any say from local surf schools, 
the Encinitas City Council made it illegal for surf lessons to 
run on the weekends. Within a few weeks, the most profit-
able surf schools — the same ones who helped fund upkeep 
with beach-use fees — were the only companies allowed to 
continue holding weekend lessons. Surf eCo couldn’t com-
pete. 

“I believe Surf eCo could have been an example to other 
surf companies of an environmentally friendly business 
model that was very successful,” Trust said. 

Trust said she still hopes to find an opportunity to teach 
larger surf companies how to be both profitable and eco-
conscious. Even though she can no longer teach lessons in 
Encinitas, Trust has developed the first online surf school. 
For a small donation to the Nature Conservancy through her 
website, clients can view in-depth lesson plans and watch 
instructional videos. 

“I make sure to cover all the little things that most surf 
classes leave out,” Trust said. “Like rip currents or arching 
your back as you paddle.” 

Sitting in front of your laptop, it may seem like a strange 
way to learn to surf, but considering there are YouTube 
instructional videos on everything from hula-hoop dancing 
to pogo-hopping, Trust said she thinks there might just be a 
niche.

CLUBHOPPING

E very Friday night in Warren College, the bub-bly voice of the ukulele can be heard drifting from the conference room of the Computer 
and Science Engineering Building — all thanks to a 
freshmen seminar taught by computer-science and 
engineering department chair Keith Marzullo.

MUS 87: Beginning Ukulele brought about 20 
students together for one day a week for a school-
ing in the basics of the peaceful Hawaiian instru-
ment. After Revelle College sophomore Vashisht 
Madabhushi took the seminar last year, he decided to 
create the UCSD Ukulele Club. Marzullo then helped 
Madabhushi connect with other ukulele enthusiasts 
on campus, and the group of about six students start-
ed an official student organization last quarter

“The ukulele has been treated as more of a toy in 
the past,” Marshall College sophomore David Chan 
said. “People are now seeing it as an instrument with 
a lot of original charm to it.” 

The Ukulele Club meets Friday nights from 4 p.m. 
to 7 p.m. The first hour serves as an instruction ses-
sion for new members and beginners, and the last two 
hours opens up for advanced players to jam together.

All beginners must first master “This Land Is Your 
Land” before taking on Jason Mraz’ “I’m Yours,” John 
Mayer’s “Daughters” and Jay Sean’s “Down.” 

At meetings, faculty and staff often play alongside 
the undergraduates. Chan said the club is open to 
anyone who likes playing ukulele or who wants to 
learn how to play. 

“The only requirement is that you are teachable 
and want to learn,” Chan said.

He added that owning a ukulele is not required, 
although it is preferred: Currently, Marzullo — who 
serves as the club’s advisor — lends out a total of 5 
ukuleles. According to Chan, a used ukulele costs 
anywhere from $50 to $500. Madabhushi, in charge 
of administrative duties for the club, said he is trying 
to get a hold of more additional models so that more 
new members can participate during meetings. 

Although there are no more performances 
planned, this year the Ukulele Club did perform for 
prospective students and their parents on Admit Day.

 “There is an organic growth to the club,” Chan 
said. “I didn’t want this club to have a meeting agen-
da. The Ukulele Club spends time relaxing by getting 
together, playing and teaching ukulele.”

UKULELE CLUB
have to pay $35. Out of time and money, 
team members quickly scrapped together 
two three-pound mini-bots in three 
weeks. One of them, unfortunately, never 
made it to the competition, as it was still 
unfinished on competition day. The other 
was called Mini Triton. 

“It didn’t do too well in competition, 
but the fact that it drove was something,” 
Yang said.

Taking inspiration from UCSD’s 
marine surroundings, Robotix decided 
to name all their fighting robots after sea 
creatures. Last year’s robot took on the 
moniker of Greek sea god Triton, and this 
year’s Kraken paid tribute to a large sea 
monster.

“We’re starting a theme of sea-creature 
named robots to honor UCSD, because 
we’re like — the ocean, or something,” 
Yang said.

The weekend began and finished with 
bloodshed — specifically Yang’s, as he cut 
himself twice trying to turn Kraken on 
and off.  The most exciting battle team 
Robotix fought in was against Dark Cyde 
— a robot that had a flipper.

After checking to make sure all were 
safe, and the arena doors were shut 
securely, the referee began a countdown. 
Kraken charged at the Dark Cyde, as the 
latter launched their weapon, missing 
twice. Robotix’s agile robot prevailed, 
managing to get underneath the oppos-
ing robot to ram them repeatedly into the 
arena walls, damaging a battery and their 
frame weapon. 

“We would get around them get 
behind them and throw them into a wall, 
its really like ramming someone into a 
solid wall.” Jiang said. 

Kraken emerged victorious in two out 
of the four frays it competed in. There 
were two ways for a robot to win at the 
Robogames —the first is to completely 
destroy your opponent’s machine, and the 
second is to immobilize it. If neither robot 
is incapacitated after three minutes, a 
panel of three judges named the winner. 

“We won normally by the judges’ deci-

sion,” Yang said. “One judge was [from 
‘Mythbusters’] —Grant Imahara — so 

that was pretty cool.”
Between rounds, competitors are 

allowed to repair their robots. Fortunately 
for Robotix, Kraken’s damage remained 
fairly minimal: isolated to tears on its tires 
and a sizable dent in its shield from plow-
ing opponents. 

“We were lucky we didn’t sustain 
much damage,” Yang said. “Some robots 
are other robots’ kryptonite.”

Yang said the team hoped that Kraken 
would be the Achilles heel for UCLA’s 
robot. One month before the competition, 
Robotix challenged the UCLA team to a 
grudge match before the competition. 

“Daniel even drew a little UCLA robot 
on the top of our robot, and it was on 
fire, ” Jiang said. “We had designed it to 
withstand UCLA’s robot, and it never hap-
pened. UCLA didn’t bring their robot — 
it wasn’t finished yet.”

As the last few weeks of Spring 
Quarter trickle away, the Robotix co-
captains are already devising another 
ferocious robot to smash next year’s com-
petition — this time, with weaponry. Jiang 
has even pitched a name for the improved 
bot: Crysomallon Squamiferum, a type of 
iron-armored sea snail. He said he expects 
the new machinery to cost more, but 
that he isn’t worried about finding spon-
sors thanks to a mix of generous donors, 
including Expro, SolidWorks, Eplastics, 
Mutant Robots and Hiveports.com.

“A lot of people are interested in 
having a very fast, hardcore spinning 
weapon,” Jiang said. “I’m all for new ideas. 
Should be exciting. Each year we’re getting 
better at getting people and sponsors, so 
we can afford to take the [offensive].”

Yang said he anticipated a similar 
upgrade to the Robotix representative in 
2011.

“Next year, we’re going to build some-
thing really scary and destructive,” Yang 
said. “At least, that’s my plan.”

College students have been going to Tommy’s since 1946 for the 
greatest burger in L.A., possibily the world. If  you haven’t been 
to Original Tommy’s World Famous Hamburgers you’re missing 

a big part of  the college experience.

WORLD FAMOUS HAMBURGERS

If Plaza Cafe’s frightening excuse for beef gives you a food-poisoning hangover the size of Milwaukee, head to the corner of Prospect 
Street and Girard Avenue to satisfy your cow 
cravings. There’s a new burger joint in town: It’s 
called Smashburger and it’s the latest in a long line 
of Smashburgers known for their customizable 
options, cold beers and designer selection of savory 
meat.

With a minimalist aesthetic — as the shop is too 
cramped to be decorated — Smashburger’s ambi-
ence screams high class In-N-Out. If it weren’t for 
the “smash” and “sizzle” boldly painted red on its 
nondescript walls, we would almost be dining in a 
dimly lit Abercrombie and Fitch.  

Smashburger’s clientele, however, quickly pulls 
us from the delusions of VIP dining. A Mecca for 
La Jolla families, the shop’s red polyester booths 
are usually crawling with whiney high-schoolers or 

snotty five-year-olds.
First impressions and 

callow clientele aside, 
Smashburger’s juicy patties 
never fail to hit the spot. 

By slamming and 
smashing the beef 
patties onto the grill, 
chefs keep all savory 
flavor locked inside, 
await release at first 
bite. The fact that it’s 
Angus Beef makes 
the experience even 
more divine — if 
only because of its 
reputation for off-
the-charts fat con-
tent.

When ordering, 
customers can either 
design their own 
burger or try one of 
Smashburger’s spe-
cialties. If you need 
a fiery kick, try the 

Spicy Baja, topped with chipotle mayo and fresh, 
thick slices of jalapeno. Another top option is the 
San Diego Smashburger: a pile of fresh avocados 
and veggies, covered in pepper jack and slathered 
in sour cream. 

The Smashchicken is a healthier (yet still deli-
cious) choice, in which the chicken is literally 
smashed into a quarter-inch thick slice — making 
the flavor as concentrated as can be. Although side 
dishes are fairly pricey— an extra $2 to $3 with the 
purchase of a sandwich — most are hard to resist. 
The Smashfries, seasoned with olive oil, rosemary 
and garlic, taste exactly like Mom’s oven-roasted 
potatoes on Thanksgiving. But skip the haystack 
onions and fried pickles: Though the creamy dip-
ping sauces that come with these sides are delicious, 
they do little to overpower an over-whelming salti-
ness. And unless you like your asparagus, carrots 
and green beans drenched in a shower of oil, pass 
on the veggie fries.

At the end of the day Smashburger is best known 
for its milkshakes, made from real Haagen-Dazs 
and served in tall ice cream glasses with whipped 
cream on top. The post-meal staple lets us fee like 
all we need on a Friday night is a jukebox and a 
maraschino cherry — a little taste of simpler times 
in a land of lavish modernities.

Think you missed the boat on the

HPV vaccine?

Think Again

If you didn’t get the Gardasil vaccine as part 
of your childhood immunizations, it’s not too 
late. Planned Parenthood now offers free or 

low-cost Gardasil for women who want to 
significantly reduce their risk of getting 

HPV, the leading cause of cervical cancer.

nationals for the 400-meter hurdles — 
this time, as the sixth seed with a time 
of 52.18 seconds.

After an exceptional season in 
which he won nearly every race he 
entered — including the CCAA title 
in the 110 and 400 hurdles — Baham 
said he is more than ready to compete 
at nationals. 

“I’m in the best shape of my life, I’m 
hurdling the best I ever have and I’m 
faster than I ever have been,” Baham 
said. “I’ve taken care of myself, and 
we’ll just see what happens with my 
competitors when we get on the track. 
I like my odds though.”

The returning national champion in 
the javelin throw — Felipe Ortiz of the 
University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez — 
will not compete this year, which leaves 
the event wide open. UCSD sophomore 
Nick Howe is currently ranked third, 
and will look to capitalize on Ortiz’s 
absence after finishing seventh at the 
2009 championship meet.

After battling injuries earlier this 
year, senior Daniel Anderson emerged 
to have a breakout season. He is ranked 
eigth for 800-meter race, but the top 
runners ten are all seperated by less 
than two seconds.

An experienced squad, eight of the 
thirteen Tritons travelling to Charlotte 
have competed in the national meet 
before.

“The level is quite high at the top 
end of Division-II, with athletes that 
have been on national teams and even 
Olympic teams,” Salerno said. “Having 
been to the meet gives people a lot 
more confidence — and that they don’t 
just belong there, but they deserve to 
win.”

is commonly called, is often so 
unpredictable that even the most 
competent football pundits hesitate 
to provide any firm predictions. 
While Group G earns the ominous 
distinction in this year’s tournament 
— featuring Brazil, Côte d’Ivoire 
and Portugal — Group D, which 
could be called the Mini Group 
of Death, features the venerable 
World Cup stalwarts Germany, a 
talent-packed Serbia, an exceed-
ingly athletic Ghana (drawn into 
a difficult group for the second 
straight tournament) and a well-
balanced Australia. With all four 
teams ranked in the world’s top 32, 
this group is the tournament’s most 
evenly balanced from top to bottom.

Germany
No. 6 Germany is the intuitive 

pick for the group’s winner, but its 
standing as favorite is tenuous. As 
evidenced by previous World Cup 
successes — and the litany of elite 
players now honing their trade at 
the European club level — Germany 
is a premier hotbed of footballing 
talent capable of producing iconic, 
tournament-defining players. 
However, German captain Michael 
Ballack’s devastating ankle injury 
— sustained while playing in the 
English Cup final on May 15 for 
London team Chelsea Football Club 
— has deprived the team of their 
talisman, and deprived the world of 
one of football’s most well-known 
and respected players.

Ballack’s injury is even more 
damning to a team whose chances 
of victory are balanced largely on 
the presence of strong veterans. 
While this year’s German selection 
does include a smattering of older 
players — defenders Philipp Lahm 
(age 26), Arne Freidrich (age 31) 
and striker Miroslav Klose (age 
32) — at the core of the team are 
younger players with little expe-

rience playing for the German 
national team, much less on a 
stage as grand as the World Cup. 
Manager Joachim Low will bank 
on the experience of the team’s 
few seasoned leaders to stabilize 
and harness the talent of unproven 
youngsters like midfielder Mesut 
Ozil and forwards Stefan Kiessling 
and Thomas Muller. However, while 
the absence of Ballack’s leadership 
will hurt, Germany still has a more 
talented roster than any other team 
in the group — giving the team a 
good chance not just to win Group 
D, but perhaps the entire tourna-
ment. A deep run to the semifinals 
and beyond is well within question.

Serbia
While there is a substantial 

drop-off in quality between No. 16 
Serbia’s first team and its reserve 
players, it still fields a starting 11 
perfectly capable of beating any 
opposition. They proved their com-
petence during a surprisingly easy 
European qualification campaign, 
finishing ahead of group members 
France and Romania and boasting 
top-class talent in every depart-
ment.

On defense, Nemanja Vidic and 
Branislav Ivanovic — two hard-
hitting, dogged defenders who have 
garnered international acclaim for 
their exploits on English-league 
powerhouses Manchester United 
and Chelsea FC, respectively 
— form arguably one of the best 
defensive pairings in the world.

In the midfield, team captain 
Dejan Stankovic and Milos Krasic 
excel. The former, who just lifted 
the European Champions League 
Cup with club side Inter Milan 
on May 22, combines combative, 
ball-winning abilities with a wide 
passing range and a venomous shot 
from afar. Krasic, who flies under 
the international radar playing in 
the frozen tundra of Russia’s first 

division for CSKA Moscow, is a 
deadly hybrid of skill and speed. 

So, with an imposing defense 
and dynamic midfield, the Serbs 
obviously have what it takes to 
maintain form throughout the tour-
nament. Four years ago, however, 
stocked with comparable talent, 
the team (competing as Serbia-
Montenegro) lacked organization 
and team chemistry, making head-
lines with the 6–0 annihilation it 
suffered at the hands of a merciless 
Argentina.

If the Serbians are to improve 
upon that performance, they must 
avoid injury. Unlike the Germans, 
— who will likely replace Ballack 
with little impact to their on-field 
ability — the Serbians don’t have 
the luxury of an endless roster of 
talent. Should they fall at all short 
of their potential, they will have 
major problems with the likes of 
No. 20 Australia and No. 32 Ghana 
— whose African support base will 
likely make every stadium a living 
hell for any Black Star opposition. 

Ghana
The Black Stars of Ghana, 

despite an inferior pre-tournament 
ranking, are not to be taken lightly. 
Inter Milan’s Sulley Muntari and 
Chelsea FC’s Michael Essien are two 
of the finest central midfielders in 
the world. Their lethal combina-
tion of power, skill, speed, stamina 
and mental fortitude is unrivaled, 
and both play pivotal roles on their 
respective club teams.

Big names aside, when the 
Ghanaians made their improbable 
march into the round of 16 from a 
similarly difficult group four years 
ago, their play was not dependant 
on their superstars; rather, on a 
physically imposing, energetic, 
up-tempo style of football with 
which opposition teams struggled 
to cope. Because the intensity of 
this already overwhelming style will 

be enhanced by a raucous African 
crowd in the stands, not only could 
Ghana propel into the knockout 
rounds, but they could very well 
claim top group honors.

Australia
Lastly, the Socceroos — the fans 

affectionate name for the team — are 
no slouches. The team may not boast 
any international superstars, but its 
complexion is very similar to that of 
the U.S.: The team features a smat-
tering of European-based players, 
headlined by standout forward Tim 
Cahill and defender Lucas Neill. 

In 2006, the Socceroos advanced 
past the group phase to battle 
eventual champion Italy in a 0-0 
stalemate over 90 minutes. It stands 
as of one of the most controversial 
moments of the last World Cup: A 
questionable call inside the penalty 
area with mere seconds left doomed 
the Aussies to a heartbreaking 
extra-time loss. With many players 
from that team returning this year, 
the Socceroos will have retribution 
on their mind entering group play. 
However, given the equally powerful 
motivations and superior ability of 
their group opponents, the Aussies 
will most likely impact the group as 
a spoiler rather than a group leader.

The Verdict
Ultimately, the Germans have 

too much World Cup pedigree and 
raw talent not to advance out of the 
group. Maybe. However, the team 
that joins them in the knockout 
rounds will be determined by the 
winner of Serbia vs. Ghana on June 
13 — a matchup that promises to be 
one of the best of the group phase. 
Maybe.

The only thing I can really pre-
dict with any great is that there’s 
only way to make watching Group 
D any better than it already prom-
ises to be: Watch it with a beer in 
hand.

ELIAS TUMA | BASEBALL

TRACK & FIELD — The best athletes — the UCSD track and field 
team has to offer know the stakes for their final meet of the season. 
With one quality race, throw or jump, any one of them could return to 
campus a national champion, and be immortalized in the Triton history 
books forever.  

From May 27 to May 29, UCSD will be represented by 13 athletes 
— nine women and four men — at the 2010 NCAA Division-II Track 
and Field Championships held at Johnson C. Smith University in 
Charlotte, N.C. One of the top programs in the nation, UCSD have 
several athletes poised to take national titles, including two with the 
top ranking in their respective events.

“What I like about this group is that most of them are ranked in the 
top 10 in their event,” head coach Tony Salerno said. “At this level, any-
body who is ranked in the top five or so is right there — so that leaves 
us pretty excited.” 

Fresh off her second consecutive Athlete of the Meet award at the 
CCAA championships last week, senior Christine Merrill will compete 
in four events in Charlotte. Along with defending her national title in the 
400-meter hurdles, Merrill will run the 100-meter hurdles and both the 
4x100 and 4x400 relays. This will be Merrill’s fourth straight trip to the 
D-II national championships. 

Junior Kelly Fogarty — who will join Merrill on the relay teams — is 
similarly slated to compete in four events for the Tritons. Fogarty will 
enter the championships ranked ninth in both the 100- and 200-meter 
races, having set school records of 11.74 seconds and 23.97 seconds in 
the events, respictively, earlier this season. 

 Senior Linda Rainwater was scratched from the heptathlon lineup 

due to injury, but is still scheduled to compete as the top seed in the 
high jump. Rainwater worked through the pain of a fractured back to  
win conference in the high jump last week. Though she is the defending 
national champion in the event, Rainwater’s medical clearance will not 
be certain until just before she leaves for Charlotte. 

“If we knew at the time, we would have pulled her; and by the end 
of the event she needed help off the mat after each jump,” Salerno said. 
“But she was able to get up and wind it up again, and she got the jump 
she needed to win. You hear about tough athletes — this was really 
impressive.”

Even in Rainwater’s absence, UCSD will not be short on talent in 
the heptathlon. Junior Stephanie LeFever won the conference title in the 
event. LeFever is also entered in the long jump and 4x400 meter relay, 
part of her impressive nine-event schedule in Charlotte.  

Sophomore Jacqueline Rose and freshman Kathleen Hitchens will 
join Merrill and Fogarty on the 4x100 team; Rose will also run on the 
4x400 team. The squads are ranked ninth and sixth, respectively. 

Junior Theresa Richards and senior Marie Archer will represent 
UCSD in the throwing events, with Richards ranked seventh in the jav-
elin throw and Archer ranked 15th in the hammer throw. Senior Donna 
LeFever will arrive ranked No. 10 in the pole vault. 

On the men’s side, senior Casey Ryan leads the team as UCSD’s other 
top-ranked athlete. Already the school record holder in the event, Ryan 
holds the national lead by nearly three inches; at 7’3.25”.

Fellow senior Leon Baham is making his second straight trip to 

I t’s no secret, really: The magic, drama and intrigue of the FIFA World Cup is at its pinnacle 
during the tournament’s two-week, 
high-octane knockout round. Having 
weathered their respective groups, 
the remaining 16 nations go to battle 

in emotionally charged, single-elimi-
nation fixtures — until one (and only 
one) nation immortalizes itself in the 
pages of history. And, of course, in 
the hearts and minds of adoring (or 
bitterly resentful) fans.

When the field of 32 competing 
nations is drawn, lottery-style, into 
eight groups for the two-week group 
phase of the monthlong tourna-
ment, two frontrunners can usually 
be inferred. Certain countries have 
proven themselves time and time 
again throughout the tournament’s 
history to be worthy contenders in 
the final fortnight. Even the most 
soccer-apathetic of individuals are 
familiar with World Cup usuals 
Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Italy and 
France. These squads  are all safe bets 
for deep runs into the tournament’s 
latter stages, and can be penned in 
as the winners of their respective 
groups before a ball is even kicked.

However, at each quadren-
nial competition, the lottery draw 
arbitrarily warps the fortunes of a 
few nations — randomly casting 
four quality teams into a group and 
effectively creating the World Cup 
equivalent of a four-way heavyweight 
free-for-all. As only two of these four 
juggernauts are allowed to advance 
to the legend-defining knockout 
rounds, the group is typically full 
of tense, evenly fought tussles — an 
emotional rollercoaster for fans 
of the participating teams, and a 
mouth-watering spectacle for neutral 
bystanders.

CREW FINISHES STRONG AT GOLD RIVER
By Liam Rose
Associate Sports Editor

WOMEN’S CREW — They may have been up 
against top competition in their final race on 
Saturday — with little chance of earning a place 
in the National Division-II rowing champion-
ships  —   but the UCSD women’s crew team still 
managed to turn in its fastest performance of 
the year.

At the Pacific Coast Rowing Championships 
on May 15, the Tritons faced an elite lineup of 
teams, but still came home with 26 medals among 
24 members of the varsity and novice squads. 

The varsity eight-boat came in at 7:22.8, 
recording its best time of the season. Competitors 
included Western Washington University, the 
five-time defending NCAA D-II National 
Champions. Though WWU broke to the front 
at the start of the race, the Tritons trailed close 
behind and showed good finishing speed in the 
last 500 of the 2000 meters.

“They had a terrific race and finished the 
season beautifully,” head coach Patti Pinkerton 

said. “I think we got all the speed we could get 
and executed our race very well. Maybe it sounds 
trite, but when it comes together like that, it’s just 
magical.” 

The varsity eight has dropped its time more 
than 20 seconds since the start of the year. 
On Saturday, the boat was led by captains 
senior Jesi Bennett and junior Denise Kleckner 
and powered by seniors Lynn Nguyen, Wanda 
Chin, Summer Austin and Jaime Bigwood, as 
well as junior Megan Simmons and freshman 
Courtney Escajeda. Junior Katrina Paz served 
as coxswain.

The varsity four-boat also held its own at 
the season-ending tournament, coming in third 
behind two boats from WWU. The varsity light-
weight four took home one of two Triton golds 
that day, topping University of Oregon by several 
boat lengths. Senior Brianna Patterson rowed in 
the stroke position for both boats, wrapping up 
her Triton career with two medal-winning per-
formances.  

The novice four earned a third-place medal 
in the race, coming in behind D-I competitors 

UCLA and St. Mary’s University. 
Austin finished her senior year by winning the 

Collegiate Single Skull — a single-person race — 
followed by sophomore teammate Carolyn Belak.    

For a squad that lacked experience at the 
beginning of the season, Pinkerton said the 
Tritons quickly learned to gel as team. 

“We have a lot of young rowers, so we’ve 
been working hard to get everyone on the same 
page,” Pinkerton said. “You will always have some 
athletes that are better than others, but as long as 
everyone works as hard as they can, it’s going to 
come together — and we really did that.”

Because most of the team will be returning 
next year, Pinkerton said she is optimistic that the 
Tritons will continue to improve next season.

“In order to get back to the national champi-
onships, we will need to drop another 20 seconds 
next season, and get down to about seven min-
utes,” Pinkerton said. “Before, it was just theoreti-
cal; but now, the team believes that it’s possible.”
