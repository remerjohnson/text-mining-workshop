The Advisory Committee on 
Student Fee (Reg Fee) Pro-
grams Wednesday turned down 
a $25,475 subsidy request that 
would have allowed the UCSD 
Day Care Center to continue 
operating under its current 
program. 

Muir Committee Representa-
tive Carroll Wills moved to 
support the center at a $17,000 
level, but his attempt died for ' 
lack of a econd . Third College 
Provo t Joseph Watson count-
" red with a $12,000 proposal 
whic h al 0 failed . Wills 
reintroduced his original 
request. which again failed 
with a two to five vote. 

Day Care parents had been 
advancing a proposal in which 
the State Department of 
Education would fund 32 child 
slot , 75 percent of the current 
operating budget. The remain-
ing 25 percent would ha ve been 
covered by student Reg Fees. 

Although $21,000 have been 
contributed by the Reg Fee 
Committee to the Day Care 
Center over the last two years , 
the committee. announced last 
Spring quarter its intention to 
withdraw all subsidy. 

The eight month controversy 
over child care facilities -
culminated in a six hour sit-in 
insi de the administrative 
complex as a response to the 
Chancellor 's announcement 
that he could no longer provide 
an annual subsidy from 
discretionary funds. 

Even though the parents are 
attempting to continue the 
Piaget open classroom format 
for the center, the Business 
Office is currently exploring an 
arrangement to bid the service 
out to an off campus agency at 
reduced staffin£ costs. 

When asked what he felt the 
next action would be, Associate 
Vice-chancellor for Student 
Affairs Richard Whitehill 
re ponded , "I'm assuming 
other alternatives are avail-
able either through improved 
management of our center or 
through placement in the

Tho"mpson takes on 
students in visit here 

by Reed Alpert 
Associate News Editor 

Looking more like a CHP officer than the outrageous creator 
of Gonzo journalism, Dr. Hunter S. Thompson screamed, 
slurred and otherwi e responded to questions from the 
audience in an abbreviated stage-show Tuesday night in 
Revelle Cafeteria. 

" I'm sure it ' a wretched, fucking , sick thing," Thompson i 
labeled a question about the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). :! 
" The DEA wants to keep the price of marijuana up," he said, ! 
" they can't keep the quantity down. They want to keep the 
drugs out of the hands of the rabble. J 

Carlos Montalvo, defeating 
Richard Ferlito, will be the 
next Commissioner of Public 
Relations. 

Margot Tempereau, who took 
60.8 percent of the vote in a field 
of five candidates, will be the 
next Commissioner of Acade-
mic Affairs . 

Another campaign 
With the top two positions still 

contested, the candidates are 
gearing-up for another cam-
paign. 

Moser said after the results 
(Please turn to page 4) 

" That's the reason for the paraquat thing, they've driven 
Mexican weed either off the market or up or down or whatever. ~ Thomp o n listens to a question from behind the bottlu. 
I don ' t smoke it. By tainting the Mexican weed they've driven 
the price of Columbian up by 30 percent." Th 0 m p son 0 n st a rd 0 m Thompson originated a style of writing termed Gonzo , 
journalism, a judicious mixing of fact, fantasy and whatever d" t 
other bullshit Thompson t hinks he can slip past. He has written rug s w r I tin ge e 
for the National Affairs Desk of Rolling Stone magazine, been , , ••• 
the model for the Uncle Duke c haracter in the Doonesbury by Mark tadler 
comic strip, and authored three books, two of them in the Fear Senior Editor 
and Loathing genre. Hunter S. Thompson was getting a little worried. As he tood 

Throughout the one-hour show Thompson kept a glass of Wild in the darkness near the Revelle Formal Lounge, Tuesday 
Turkey on the rocks and a bottle of Heineken near him and night, watching the long line of people filing into the Revelle 

(Please tum to pa ge 12) Cafeteria where Thompson was soon to speak, he wondered 
..... aloud what his listerners would do when they learned he c!ould 

only stay for an hour. 
"This could be vicious," Thompson said to the small crowd of 

students who had gradually gathered around him. " I don ' t 
mind being late, but I hate cutting out early, especially with 
a mob around ." 

The situation was not really Thomp on' fault. He had been 
due at San Diego's Lindbergh Field at 6: 30 pm - plenty of time 
to make his 8: 30 speaking ngagement here. But that flight wa 
cancelled, an€! Thompson had to catch a plane arrIvIng at 7: 55 . 

But that wasn ' t the end of th Doctor' s problems with th 
airlines. He had scheduled him elf on a flight leaving San Diego 
at 11: 30 pm - again, plenty of time to peak at UCSD and till 
got on his plane. This plane was al 0 cancell d. ince Thompson 
in isted he had to be back in Lo Angele by midnight, he had to 
take th next available flight which wa at 10: ~'O . 

So Thompson was going to face a standing-room-only crowd, 
that paid $2 .50 and $3 ,50 to ee him, th n cut out after only an 
hour with hi $1600 speaking- fe .

Victory for the AS 

A preliminary glance at the vote totals for this week's AS 
elections seems to indicate a solid victory for the AS itself. Not only 
did over 30 percent of the students turn out to vote - a phenomenal 
turnout - but those students largely supported candidates who 
can be considered government insiders. 

H there was widespread dissatisfaction with the AS, surely 
students would have supported the candidates running directly 
against the government. There were certainly enough such 
candidates available. But, instead, the students backed the 
candidates who either have experience in student government, or 
are running on a slate with several insiders. 

This either means that students seriously back the AS. or that 
they don 't really care about it one way or the other, or that they 
just thought the experienced candidates were the best. 

So what's going to happen in next weeks run-off elections? It's 
always risky to predict which way the losing candidates' votes 
will go in a run-off election, especially wi.thout any ~ind of polli~g 
information available. But I'll throw cautIOn to the wmd and try It. 

The major factor to keep in mind is that nerot week's run-off will 
be held on one day, next ~hursday. This should cause a 
substantially lower turnout since this week's large turnout was 
divided fairly equally between Tuesday a nd Wednesday . 

This factor should be the major consideration in who wins the 
presidential run-off between Gary Moser and John Jenkel. The 
two candidates virtually tied this week and the ultimate winner 
will be the person who can muster his forces and get his supporters 
to the polls a second time. Right now the election is toss-up; much 
too close to call. 

In the vice-presidential and appointments and evaluations run-
offs the candidates who took the most votes in this week's ball~ting look like shoe-ins next week. Both Ann Carberry, in the V-
P race, and Marlene Peterson , in the A&E race, captured well 
over 40 percent of the vote, and were far ahead of their nearest 
opponent. 

In the communications election, in which Bill Friedman and 
Jamie Montgomery ran almost even, Friedman stands the best 
chance of collecting most of third candidate Paul Karoffs votes. 
While Montgomery came out in favor of consolidating all 
subsidiary journals into one conglomeration, both Friedman and 
Karoff favored maintenance of the current subsidary journal 
situaton. 

The low point of the election so far has been the behavior of 
Elections Commissioner Lori Dority and the ASUCSD Bulletin. In 
this week's " election edition", the Bulletin printed a "comment" 
by Dority, which was actu~lly a diatrybe against candidates Ed 
Thalheimer and Dan Amos and the Judicial Board. Publication of 
Dority's anguished comment was a cheap and shabby trick by the 
Bulletin , which is supposed to be a neutral government journal. 
It was especially inappropriate to print the thing in an "election 
edition." 

I wonder if the AS and Dority checked out the libel laws before 
saying in print that Thalheimer and Amos were guilty of violations 
worth disqualification, after the Judicial Board ruled otherwise? 

As for Dority 's com pia ints about the Judicial Boa rd' s decision a 
board member said the board ' s m ai n problems with the 
Thalhemier case resulted from her poor presentation of the 
evidence against the candidates. H Thalheimer and Amos were 
really guilty it was Dority, with her shoddy casework, that let 
them off the hook.

Chancellor is lying about parking 

Editor: 
The Chancellor is lying about 

parking fees and setting up a 
special committee which he can 
manipulate to give him the go 
ahead he wants on the University 
Hospital parking garage fee 
increase scheme. 

The Chancellor's perception of 
the parking situation (quoted in the 
Triton Times, Friday, April 28 , pg. 
1) : "There hasn't been an increase 
(in parking fees) since I've been 
here." I wonder where he was in 
June of 1974 when parking fees were 
increased by 25%? 

Of course his parking fees have 
not increased - he gets a special 
reserved spot as pa rtofthe job. The 
Regents consider it a small price to 
pay for his ability to lie so glibly 
about everybody else's parking 
fees.

Apology for 
Poli Sci 109 
Editor: 

To the students of Political 
Science 109 an d particularly 
professor Kernell, regarding the 
incident which took place on the 
final class day of last quarter. 

This is to publicly apologize for 
our actions which were not only 
disrespectful to all involved, but 
also deprived you of your basic 
right to education as set forth in the 
bylaws of this university. We were 
ignorant of Professor Kernell 's 
right to instruct the class, and more 
importantly, we were ignorant of 
the student's right to learn at a 
crucial time in the quarter. 

But ignorance is no excuse for 
something which never should have 
happened to begin with , and seeing 
beyond our selfish intentions of that 
afternoon , we heartily apologize.

somely (e.g. a rent-free 18 room 
mansion ) for his ability to 
manipulate. Can anyone doubt that 
the purpose of his special 11 -
member parking task force is to 
give him the recommendation 
which the official Parking Advisory 
Committee would not? 

The Parking Advisory Commit-
tee exists precisely to deal with 
issues such as the Chancellor wants 
to divert to the special task force 
which he will appoint. Of course, 
the Advisory Committee would 
have difficulty meeting during the 

summer (when the pruposed Task 
Force will do its work) because the 
student representatives would not 
be around to attend . That sort of 
makes you wonder who is going to 
represent the student interests on 
the Task Force, doesn't it? 

My guess is that it will probably 
be several (i.e . a majority of the 11 
members) Special Assistants to the 
Chancellor and a few doctors from 
the University Hospital. In such 
good hands, our pa rking fees are 
bound to increase. 

DON STREBEL 

Parking 'Advisory Rep 
explains committe'e actions 
Editor: 

In response to Monday's article on the Parking Advi ory Committee 
rejection of the increase in the 78-79 year fees, I feel tha t students need to 
know the facts of why we rejected it. 

After ha ving found out about the proposed increase two weeks before the 
meeting, I decided to find out what had gone into the proposal. I found out 
the following: 

1. This proposal and all of its studies only started three months ago. This 
time was supposedly the time needed to look into alternative parking and 
funding . 

2. The A&E office stated that there was only one place to build a parking 
structur~which I looked into and found completely false . 

3. Apparently, the residents complained about the situation , but 
according to Associate Vice-chancellor Don Sites they held only one 
meeting and out of quite a few thousand residents only 60 showed up. 

4. One of the major points is that this university's administration did not 
even bother to look into having the parking structure being funded by the 
state, because of the fear that they might lose tbeir jobs. This info came 
from a source that wished to keep this "off the record." 

5. The California Air Pollution Control District has served a second 
warning to UCSD to cut down on emmision outputs. Is building another 
parking structure complying with this warning? 

6. The last point I wish to make is that the employees at the present time 
don' t want to pay to use the parking lot down there now, when parking on 
the streetis free . What is going to make them pay fifty dollars more to park 
in this new parking structure? 

I find it quite disturbing that as a student of UCSD I had to find these 
things out. We hire professionals to do this job. I suue.ted, along with 
many other people, for the Chancellor to have his admirtistration look into 
other alternatives that we proposed. The Chancellor bas the time, the 
people, and the support of the students, staff and faculty if he does this. 
Let 's see if he respects the Parking Advisory Committee's 
recommendation.

. Increased school spirit at UCSD is not all Rah-Rah 
by Susan Self 

As a loyal fan of varsity basketball , I must say that I have mixed feelings about 
efforts to increase school spirit at UCSD by having more people show up at games. 
For most of the season there is only a small and not very vocal crowd of spectators, 
but these people are real enthusiasts of basketball and appreciate seeing it played 
well no matter who wins. When on a designated "spirit night" troops of people come 
marching in to hold a shouting competition among the dorms, it distracts a lot from 

, the game. Such fans are fairweather friends coming for ulterior motives- to draw 
attention to themselves and win a prize - rather than because they care about 
basketball , our team or any particular players. It is true that our team represents 
our school, and that's something to support , but such a symbolic relationship is 

· rather removed from the reality of five people running on a wooden floor and 
throwing a leather ba ll around. If one comes to a game only for the symbolic reason 
of supporting the bes~ presentatives of our school, the joy of the sport itself i lost , 

· and one shouts for it e school rather than for the real people out there playing. 

Susan Self is a gradlJate student in the Dep~rtment of Lit.eratur 

· I am not knocking ,an support by any means, for I think the feeling of the crowd 
· behind the team on lhe first spirit night helped them beat a theoretically much 
superior opponent. Wh t I object to are the kinds of fans who take a personal pride 
in their school' s team and need the team to win in order to sustain their own 
in ecure egos . The fo lowers of some of the visiting teams we play especially eem 
to be this way, but thEre's 110 need to imitate them. Atone game our team was down 
by about twenty poin ts with little time for recovery, yet the cheerleaders and fans 
of the opponents were s houting and clawing for two more points a if to kick a 
beaten man once more just to make sure he knows who's superior. Such' a 
malicious and adistic attitude toward an opponent is contrary to what sports 
should be about. Competition between schools is for the purpose of c reating 
challenging situations for excellent athletes in order that they may bring out their 
potential and d velop th ir skills further . One wants a respected a nd well-matched 
opponent becau too little or too gr at a challenge Is either boring or fru trating. 
There i as little joy in destroying an opponent as there i in being destroyed by him , 

.. u.n.l . siiis. o.n.i.s. a. sa. dilli.st. o .. rMa l!iom""a.' siii0*icijhi:ijis. tiil!' ii-~~at one need an overwhelmin victory to 

mamtain his pride only shows hGW hurt and inferior he feel in the first place. A 
really together athlete is strong in himself and free enough not to need constraint 
winning and approval to feel good about himself. , 

The fans .who bring their own insecurities to a game and do not show sympathy 
and respect for the opponent, even though they want to win, actually do a disservice 
to the players. They create an atmosphere charged with cutthroat competition 
and undue tension and anxiety that can inhibit the players' ability to flow and 
perform well . Nowhere have I seen this bad feeling more than at the spirit night of 
the disasatrous final game of the season. The rowdy troops from the dorms 
marched in and got engaged in a shouting competition not only among themselves 
but with the adamant and very vocal followers from Azusa Pacific. The loudness 
and emotional intensity of the antagonism had little to do with the game but was so 
uncomfortable and disturbing, like the incipient stirrings of a riot, that I almost . 
wanted to get up and leave. Although the energies of the crowd were pretty well 
contained, I sensed the danger of the latent violence within it. There is no way of 
knowing for sure, but it seems to me that the antagonistic atmosphere created by 
the fans may be partly responsible for Azusa Pacific's Mike Berry punching Peter 
Yolk on very little provocation . All a player with a hairtrigger temper needs to 
encourage the u e of violence and push him beyond his limit of self-control is a 
conflict between shouting, fight-happy fans . It is hard to imagine such an incident 
occurring so easily in the presence of a quiet crowd there just to enjoy the game 
without wanting to antagonize the opponents and increase the players' sense that 
their egos are on the line or their pride is being challenged. . 

In conclUSion, my feeling is that people should not come to games unless they will · 
really SUPPORT the team. That means: 1) they appreciate and ca re about the 
individual players a nd the team and not just its ymbolic value; 2) they don ' t 
unduly distract from the game by calling attention to themselves; 3) tl)ey don ' t 
direct their energies to ridiculing and " destroying" the opponents but to praising ' 
and encouraging th ir own team members . Ideally, one should have enough 
ympathy and humanity to feel along with the player on both teams' so thata good 

play by the opponents can be appreciated as well as one by the home team. A 
shifting betw en uch disintere ted observation and motionally-engaged 
partisanship allow one to obtain maximum pleasure from the game without 
maligning the opponent or feeling too di appointed if our side 10 s. When sports 
are thus dominated b dee stron sitiv feelin ever n tands to win .

Teaching: A 'secondary considera tion 
Two letters consider the issue, specifically in 

the Political Science Department 

4/17178 
Dr. Lakoff: 

I realize that you and the members of the 
political science office are trying to do your 
best to provide an upgrad~d and well-rounded 
education for your students . But, please allow 
me to make one comment in reference to Dr. 
Bender ' s situation . Professor Laitin 
mentioned in today 's Triton Times that good 
teaching is a secondary consideration for the 
political science office. For any student w~o 
sits through 12-15 hours of class a week - thIS 
statement is extremely depressing. A good 
professor, such as Bender, is a joy and 
inspiration for all - and, a rare l.vmmodity! 
Half the beauty of learning is being inspired 
by those with superior kn~wledge , wh?m >,:ou 
wish to emulate. It prOVIdes the motivatIOn 
necessary to pursue education and 
knowledge. I have actually dropped classes 
that had extremely interesting summaries in 
the catalog because the professor proved to 
be so boring or uninspiring or unknowled-
geable. There is nothing worse than to be 
excited about taking a class - only to have 

.. the subject matter practically ruin~d by a 
person who either is not good at or IS bor~d 
with teaching. Classroom performance IS 
paramount! 

Lastly , I would just like to say that I have 
found many excellent professors at UCSD 
such as Dr. Bender, Dr. Heller and many 
more. But on the contrary I have found some 
of the political science staff to be far infe~ior 
to Dr. Bender in both knowledge and teachmg 
abilities. And I think that the popular a nd 
fascinating subject which Dr. Bender teaches 
could hardly be " redundant" and not add 
" breadth" to the curriculum. He is teaching 
something vital to the United States ' foreign 
affairs - and what could be more necessary 
to widening the intellectual scope of the 
department? 

At any rate , thank you very much for your 
time and attention . 

JANE WIL ON

Miss Wilson: 

Thank you [or your note concerning 
Professor Bender. 

As it happens, I agree strongly with mo~tof 
what you say in your letter. I do not believe 
that teaching ability should be " secondarv" 
in university appointments. I think it should 
be considered seriously as one of the {actors, 
and that in a case where a teacher is clearly 
" a joy and inspiration" to his students, that 
factor should weigh heavily in the balance. 

Unfortunately, this is not the standard 
enerall a lied in rna' or i.e . research-

oriented) universities . That is what I think 
Prof. Laitin had in mind in making the 
comment quoted in the Triton Times; he did 
not say that he approved of this practice. 

As far as this department is concerned, it is 
a matter of considerable personal regret to 
me that in this case we should be applying the 
same narrow standards that have brought 
undergraduate teaching into disrepute at 
other major universities . Nor was this a case 
in which the candidate was so inadequate on 
the research criterion as to preclude serious . 
consideration on the ground of exceptional 
teaching ability - and on the ground of public 
service as well . As you rightly point out, Prof. 
Bender already made an impressive 
contribution to the public debate over 
American foreign policy toward Africa . As a 
consultant to leading members of Congress, 
as an articulate contributor to such 
influential media as the Washington Post and 
Foreign Policy magazine , and as a 
prospective member of the new Rockefeller 
Foundation Commission on American Policy 
Toward Africa, he will undoubtedly continue 

,to play an important role in this connection . 
Any department in the country would be 
fortunate to have such a talented and 
valuable scholar on its faculty . 

On one point I disagree with your 
formulation of this department's policy and 
practice. We do care about teaching . We have 
not knowingly appointed anyone who was 
likely to be a poor u~dergrad.u.ate tt:acher .• 
Political science majors famIliar With the 
record of the department over the past 
several years know that this is the case. The 
last set of CAPE evaluations rated every 
regular member of the department quite 
highly on the score of teaching eff~ctive":ess . 
I sincerely hope that our courses Will conti nue 
to merit the approval of seriou students like 
yourself, and I can only say that in this • 
particular instance I share your regret over 
the Department's decision . 

I am afraid that this practice will not be 
reversed until it is changed at the universities 
which educate the leading members of the 
academic profession . When Harvard, Yale, 
MIT and Berkeley consider exceptional 
teaching a bility to weigh equally with 
research achievement , then those who 
acquire their academic standards a~~ng with 
their doctorates from these UniversIties may 
be willing to do the same. 

I should perhaps add ~at these comments 
reflect my own personal views and should not 
be construed as reflecting those of any or all . 
of my departmental colleagues.

sents an exceptional model 
program for the region and the 
university has a responsibility 
to act as an educational leader, 
rather than accept the sub-
standard conditions caused by 
franchising . 

From an opposing perspec-
tive Whitehill states. " I'm not 
at all sure this center or the 
program is the model it's been 
presented as. Nor am I sure at 
all that a program just as 
effective from an educational 
and developmental standpoint 
couldn't be done at a far less 
expense." 

After the meeting with the 
committee, Layon commented, 
" It is an issue of priorities 
where they' choose to spend our 
mont:y. Films or dances might 
be alright, but single parents 
can't go to school wi!hout a day 
care service." Layon continued 
that, " If anything, we should 
expend more money to expand 
the center. There are 70 more 
children on the waiting list. " 

Parents were angry and 
disappointed that the commit-
tee had ignored over 4,000 
signatures collected from 
students on petitions asking for 
day care funding. "They (the 
committee) felt they could 
overlook the petitions, despite 
their capacity and responsi-
bility to regr ent students," 
said parent Terri McDarby. 
"Day care would cost only $2.50 
per student per year. That is a 
small pittance compared to the 
overall Reg Fee intake. 

" The members were telling 
us that the number of students 
affected by day care didn 't 
warrant the money." 

Layon summed up the feeling 
of most parents. "We are not 
being properly represented. 
We' ll continue to struggle."

The month of May is shaping up as a major concert month for 
San Diego music enthusiasts. Hold on to your stash. This is what's 
in store: 

Tomorrow night at the UCSD Gym, Pablo Cruise will perform 
their unique form of pop/ rock at 8 pm. Opening the show will be 
Roger Voudouris. Their latest album A Place In The Sun 
skyrocketed Pablo Cruise to national prominence, with the hit 
single " Watcha Gonna Do." Tickets an be purchased at the UCSD 
box office and at Ticketron out1~ts . 

The tollowing night, Sunday May 7, will feature Angel and Head 
East at1he Sports Arena. Opening the show will be the Godz. The 
what? Anyway, an evening of unmitigated, hard-driving rock and 
roll. 

Singer/songwriter Lloyd Thacker will appear in two noon 
concerts at UCSD, with a performance in the Muir Plaza on 
Thursday, May 11 and at the Revelle Plaza on Wednesday, May 17. 
This is an excellent chance for students to enjoy some fine 
homegrown talent. 

Gordon Lightfoot, one of Canada's premier performers, will 
perform at the Civic Theatre on Sunday, May 14. 

Also performing that night, crosstwon at the Sports Arena will 
be John "Thank God I'm A Country Boy" Denver. The show is 
Dfwer's first appearance in San Diego in well over a year, and is 
his only one this time around. His tour, which encompassed over 44 
cities nationwide, ends in ~os Angeles the following week. 

The Patti Smith Group will arrive in San Diego Monday, May 15 
for a show at the California Theatre. , 

One of tbe greatest jazz bassists I've ever seen, Stanley Clarke, 
will perform with his band on May 25 at the Calfornia Theatre. Also 
on the bill is legendary guitarist John McLaughlin. 

REO and Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow assault the Sports 
Arena with power guitar rock n' roll on May 22 . Pray you don't 
have mid-terms the following day.

Butch Lacy 
String group 
shines bright 

by Ted Burke 
Contributing Editor 

Though one wouldn't think it 
so, San Diego has an active, 
vital music sc ne on all fronts , 
and to make the situation more 
spectacular to the novice, much 
of the homegrown talent equals 
and at times surpasses the 
nationally known acts. This 
rather pleasant revelation was 
proven at the Butch Lacy String 
Consort concert last Sunday 
night at the Mandeville 
Auditorium. I' 

Lacy, a jazz pianist with 
sparkeling technique and 
sublime lyricism, has formed 
the String Consort to pursue his 
interest in combining the lush 
textures of a string quartet with 
the frenetic elan of be-bop jazz. 
The results were astonishing, 
because Lacy, like McCoy 
Tyner and Chick Corea, is a 
composer of the first rank. able 
to bridge the gap between 
classical structuralism and the jmprovisatory freedom of jazz 
with an intuitive understanding 
of how to use the best of both. 
Lacy has banded together an 
ensemble of superlative 
musicians whose discipline and 
creative energies have found 
an uncommonly sympathetic 
context in the consort. 

Especially outstanding were 
guitarist Peter Sprague , a 
permanent consort member 
and full member of his own 
Dance of the Universe Orches-
tra, and saxophonist Hollis 
Gentry , guesting with the 
ensemble. In an age where 
every other guitarist is aping 
either John McLaughlin or Jeff 
Beck, Sprgues' approach was 
refreshing: Rooted, to my ears, 
in the be-bop styles of Joe Pass 
and Kenny Burrell, yet with a 
distinctive voice of his own, 
Sprague's solos were concise 

(Please tum to page 10) 

Last year, Head East spread their good time, basic boogie 
all over the country on the road with Frampton, Kiss, 
BTO, Jethro Tull, and Black Oak Arkansas. Now they're 
making headlines wi th another tour and a sensual new 
album of first degree boogie. Head East. The only 
way to go .

"Golden age" movie posters on Exhibit 
The first showing of 1930s and 

1940s movie posters in San 
Diego will occur at the Phaedra 
Gallery in La Jolla , 

view from May 12 to May 20 in 
the gallery. 

showing of "When Comedy 
Was King" will begin at 8 pm in 
the space adjoining the gallery . 

In the past few years there 
has been an increased interest 
in collecting these mementos of 
the " golden age" of film. A 
select collection of exceptional 
lithographic posters will be on 

On opening night, Friday, 
May 12, from 7 pm to 10 pm, Bob 
Coleman, a noted film historian 
from Los Angeles, will be in the 
gallery to answer questions on 
film, stars, directors and 
various other esoterica related 
to the cinema. In addition, a 

"First Nighters " are re-
quested to wear costumes of 
their favorite stars of the '30s 
and '40s . Prizes will be 
awarded. The public is invited . 

The Phaedra Gallery is 
located in Suite 207, 1111 
Prospect St. in La Jolla . 

Butch Lacy Strong Consort. .. 
(Continued fro~ page 9) 
showcases of taste', phrasing and technique. 
Rather than follow the notion that jazz guitar 
stylings are a series of rapid fire clump or 
brai .... fever flurries , Sprague built his sorties 
with a craftsman's care, offering melodious 
configurations and ideas, alternating between 
quicksilver lines and pensive rhythmic roles, all 
the while maintaining the "swing" of the music. 

As a composer, Lacy displays the rarest of 
talents, the proper use of dynamics . Unlike 
people he's comparable to, such as Corea (in his 
Romantic Warrior period) or Frank Zappa (a 
wildly inconsistent genius) , Lacy isn't out to 
blow the a udience away with gratuitous flash , 
either in the. ensemble work or in the soloing. 
Rather, he creates a balance and maintains a 
dynamic flow that allows the beaut~ of the 
melodies to evolve out of each suc!t!eeding 
passage instead of forcefeeding the audience 
with arrogant cleverness. 

In addition to Gentry, the other 

were Trip Sprague, on sax, Kevin Lettau on 
vocals, and Kelly Jacoy on drums, all members 
of the Dance of the Universe. Singer Lettau , 
though young, has a big, swooping voice that 
could be, at will, sweet and innocent or as brassy 
as a horn section. Tripp's sax work reminded me 
of Paul Desmond, and though lacking Gentry 's 
overall finesse, applied himself well with solos 
of good humor and sensitive clarity. Jacoy's 
drum work, on one song only unfortunately, was 
reminiscent of Philly Joe Jones and Hal Roach. 

If nothing else, the Butch Lacy String Consort 
is a masterf~ unit of exemplar local musicians 
whose dedication to good - I mean great -
music deserves the support of local audiences. 
Along with Grace, a nother local original music 
band whose work far surpasses most of the tripe 
audiences are served by all too often callous 
record companies a nd brainless pomoters , The-
String Consort is one of those rare combinat ions 
of talent that manages to produce something of 
unbelieva ble beauty.

the minimum 21 batters over

One very evident fact from 
the just-concluded season was 
the Tritons' proclivity for close 
games ... and losing those close 
games. The Tritons ' record in 
one and two-run games is what 
separated them from finishing 
with a decent. near-break even 
season. 

Fully one-quarter of the 
UCSD games were decided by 
one run, and the Tritons lost 
seven of those contests . Adding 
in two-run games - all of which 
the Tritons lost - almost half 
the UCSD games were decided 
by not more than two runs.

Thompso on all manner 01 topics ... 
(Coadllaed from pAle 1) 

"Do I meet your ima .e'" Thompson aksed 
one of his new bodyguard " Do I look like you 
thought I would? You knON, this is as bad forme 
as it is for you ... 

" We're gonna have to make this show a real 
motherfucker," he said to no one in particular. 
"Maybe I could denoun~ ... What's the name 01 
the university president? I could work on the 
president. I could have like a SO-minute outburst 
of extremely vituperative bullshit." 

He paused for a moment in his monologue, his 
deep monsyllabic voice trailing off as he took 
another drink of beer, then snorted. some into 
his nostrils in an attempt to relive an allergy he 
picked up in, LA. He adjusted his red cap, with a 
white patch that read " Muhammad Ali's 
training camp" on it, then continued . 
"Somebody's gonna have to ask the first 
question so I can measure the crowd, see who 
laughs and who doesn't. Otherwise, this could be 
madness. What do these people want to hear? 
Carter? Doonesbury?" 

His small enteurage answered in one voice: 
" Drugs." 

A small, almost shy smile crept across 
Thompson's features . Of course he knew what 
the crowd wanted to hear. " OK. Drugs. " 

Then it was time to make the entrance and 
meet the yowling mob, for what Thompson had 
predicted in the car earlier would be a " fuckin, 
King Kong nutkicker." 

"We're I gODDa 'have to make this 
show a real motherfucker ... 1 
could have like a 50 minute 
outburst of extremely vitupera-
tive buOshit." 

In the car, driving from the airport to UCSD, 
Thompson gave an exclusive interview to the 
Triton Times. Asking the questions were a 
Triton Times reporter and two students from 
University Events , who were escorting 
Thompson. Thompson was occasionally aided in 
his answers by John Kay, a Universal Pictures 
screenwriter who is writing a movie script on 
the adventures of Raoul Duke, Thompson's 
occasional pseudonym. 

In a wide-ranging interview, Thompson 
talked about the Raoul Duke film, his status as a 
media celebrity and comic strip character in 
Doonesbury , journalism, his writing, Texas, 
politics and drugs. 

Kay gave most of the background about the 
Duke movie. While he shied away from going 
into any detail, he did say it would be about "The 
life and times of Raoul Duke, 1967-1977," and 
that he should have a script done in a few 
months. 

Asked if he was going to play himself in the 
film, Thompson answered, "No, man, that's the 
weird part. It's not myself, it's Raoul Duke. 
We ' re gonna do a movie on a fictitious 
character, who's not quite fictitiou ." 

Thompson also demonstrated a fine sense for 
presenting the outrageous with a straight face, a 
sense that has helped to make his writing so 
popular. When he was asked why he had to take 
the 10: 30 flight back to LA, he replied: 

"You want to know the real answer? I can tell 
it to you. (Rolling Stone magazine editor) Jann 
Wenner had decided he ' s gonna run for 
president with Jack Ford, and he wants the 
backing of Phil Walden of Capricorn Records, 
who did pretty well with Carter. 

" Walden and I have been talking about it and 
we've decided it's worth listening to. I've been 
staying with Walden in the hotel for three days 
now, waiting for this to come together and 
Wenner's flying in, I suppose tonight, I mean he 
should be in tonight. Jack Ford's coming in to 
explain the whole thing. 

.. And it's too weird to miss. It's insane to me. I 
mean it sounds totally insane that Wenner's 
running for president. " 

"Jann Wenner has decided he's 
gonna run for president with Jack 
Ford, and he wanb the bac;king of 
Phil Walden of Capricorn 
Records, who did "retty well with 
Carter." 

Thompson acted some\\hat taken aback when 
he was asked , "How doe:l i teel to be a lOt:uia 
heavy , right up thert! with Rather and 
Cronkite? " 

HST: Oh, you can't be ;erious. 
Q: Well , how does it fed to be a celebrity? 
HST: To find yourself in a comic strip (Garry 

Trudeau's Doon bury) is trange. To me it's 
strange. I mean, I don't know anyone else I can 
go to and ask how it felt for them. 

Q: Do you feel honored to be picked on by 
Trudeau? 

HST: Oh no, not at all. I feel it's a very seriou 
invasion of privacy. If he pushe too far I'm 
gonna have him working in my yard for about20 
years . 

Q: Do you think being a public figure will k p 
you from ev r writing anything lik ear and 

Loathing on the Campaign Trail or in Las Vegas 
again? 

HST: Yeah, yeahJOf necessity I've had to stop 
that. 
Q: SO you've felt constricted? 

fIST: It's much too public. You can't write 
that kind of stuff and be a publi figure . 

Q: What kind of stuff are you writing these 
days? After the Muhammad Ali thing (now in 
Rolling Stone) ? 

HST: Well, that'll supposedly be my last journalism thing. I'm gonna make the last be the 
Ali-Spinks fight in September. 

Q: For Roiling Stone? 
HST: Well, not necessarily . 
Q: Then are you gonna turn back to fiction? 
HST: Yeah. I've just been putting if off for a 

long time. 
Q: A couple of years ago I heard a report that 

you were writing the great American novel 
about Texas. 

HST: I've been writing the great American 
novel for a long time. 

Q: Can you tell anything about it? What it's 
gonna be about? Or would that be a jinx? 

HST: It probably would never happen . But, 
uh, Texas interests me. It's one of the last really 
raw American conditions there, you know. It's 
the only place you can actually go to and .. .1 was 
in Dallas last week and coming from the airport 
somewhere, I've forgotten where, I was in a 
convertible with two girls and the idea of sitting 
at a red light with a bottle of Wild Turkey was so 
natural, it was almost like smoking . • 

I mean, you know what would happen to you 
here. Jesus Christ, you 'd look over at a 
cop ... Texas is sort of like Brazil, it's like going to 
Brazil. It's the last place where the American 
illusion really works. There really is more land 
in Texas. You can still move west. It's the last 
place in the country where you can do that. 

••••• 
Thompson's interest was caught most of all by 

the topic of drugs, and during this dialogue he 
managed to reserve the roles of interviewer and 
interviewee, as he settled back into something 
he undoubtedly finds more comfortable than 
answering questions - asking questions. 

Q: I heard rumors that you had given up 
taking hard drugs, drugs in general, maybe not 
alcohol, but pill-form drugs. 

HST: Well , that was probably a shriek of 
despair in the night you heard. It's getting 
harder and harder to get good pill-form drugs. 

Q: Where do you get good acid these days? 
HST: I don' t have any trouble getting acid. 

But so few people want it these days, it's almost 
impossible to get acid that's chemically hip. I 
think the days of psychidelics are just about 
gone. 

Q: There's been a bi~ upsurge in organic 
psychidelics. . 

HST: What kind? 
Q: Mescaline and buttons. 
HST: Really? 
Q: My experience is that I've never seel. 

anything more popular in my life. 
HST: Is this increasing taste for organic 

stylishnes or is it reflected in a quality 
availability? I mean, is it a nostalgia thing? 

Q: Oh, not in the least. Real big upsurge in 
mushroom-growing kits . People are growing 
psychedelic mushrooms in their hou es. 

HST: Does it work, or is it that High Times 
siJil? 

Q: It works. 
HST: Mushrooms that work are one of the 

hardest things to plant. Wow . That's very 
encouraging. Psychedelics that work ar 
clearly the most artistic and interesting drug 
around. 

Q: What's your preferenc , above all? 
HST: Good mushrooms . Good , the best 

mushrooms. Ever try that crystal mushroom? 
That is beautiful stuff. Ju t never snort it. It' 
like snorting crush d gla . It' one of the finest 
highs I ever had. That' the fir t tim I heard 
that, (a out organi p ych d lie ), though .

Thompsf;)n visits UCSD ... 
(Continued from page 1) 
never removed the Muhammad Ali training camp ~at that 

covered thp. remains of his short-cropped hair. 
Saigon evacuation 

Promising to talk about things that have " never been spoken of 
among the two-legged white people before, " Thompson recounted 
his experiences during the last days of Saigon. J ann Wenner, the 
editor of Rolling Stone, had assigned Thompson to Saigon, then 
fired him while he was over Guam and on his way into the war 
zone. Wenner had received a nasty letter from Thompson after 
Thompson had left for Saigon and angrily fired him. Thompson-
didn't find out he was fired until he got back. 

" It was the best story I was ever on and didn't write, " Thompson 
said, "I don't believe you should write a story for someone who 
cancels your insurance while sending you into a war zone. 

"During that ten-year period, the war was the major element in 
our lives wether we realize it or not. If I'm going to make any point 
about the whole Saigon evacuation it is there was almost a 
rebellion among the correspondents against the US Marines . I 
could not live the rest of my life knowing my ass was saved by US 
Marines." 

Throughout the show Thompson screamed out numerous fear 
and loathing threats at various people. "Shut up, swine, or I'll 
break your neck! II he shrieked at a heckler; " I want those swine 
killed! " to a group outside who was pounding on the window. 

Punk rock 
" I was so sick, I was broken hearted by the whole thing, the fact 

that rock and roll would degenerate to that (punk rock) . Nothing 
hit so hard as the failure of punk rock," Thompson said. 

Thompson, whom Doonsbury creator Gary Trudeau modeled 
the cha'ncter of Uncle Duke after, said, " I've never seen Trudeau, 
I've never met or talked to him. I don't know what to make of the 
goddamn comic strip. I'd like to se~ the motherfucker on fire ." 

Although much of what Thompson aid during the evening 
contained an angry ' note, there was no signs of hostility or 
resentment in the way he acted or spoke. His casual clothes, from 
the Ali cap down to the white Converse tennis shoes with no socks, 
and the ready, slightly cynical smile, gave the impression of 
someone who had lived through enough shit to be able to say, 
without malice and smiling easily, " It's good for you every once in 
awhile to be ripped off really badly." 

Thompson, who ran for sheriff of A~pen County in 1968, said he 
would never. return to polit ics, labeling it a self-defense 
mechanism. "Nobody believes Humphrey was anything but a 
lying asshole anyway," said Thomp on, "Nixon is the kind of 
person you could turn around on a bus and smack in the teeth with 
no guilt at all. 

"I have the best mformation of anybody in Washington because 
they realize I'm not writing about politics anymore. Since people 
don't think I'm going to lie about it, or write about it, it's the same 
thing, they don 't worry . 

Egomaniac Carter 
" I had some big hopes for Carter. I believe he has about six 

months to pull his act together. Teddy Kennedy will run in '80 and 
knock him right out. What I was looking for was Carter's 
egomaniac sense of the imperative. I'm disappointed in Carter 
and I'm afraid it is because I overestimated the chemistry of 
egomania as a means to success." 

About halfway through the show a number of people brought 
copies of Thomspon's books up for him to autograph . "Nobody 
buys these books," said Thompson, " I can see this one is stolen. 
I'm the poorest writer in America . I'm living proof that fame and 
fortune don 't go together. If I were rich I wouldn't be standing up
