Hedgecock: The district I have is the 
north side of the city of San Die,o and 
Del Mar and Poway and there re five 
campuses in my district: UCSD, State, 
USD, and USIU and Mesa. It wu 
clear at the beginning when I was 
unknown that one of the strengths that 
I could have-I was the youngest 
person who'd ever run for thi. office, 1-
was about 30-was the college 
campus. 

So I pitched the campaign on 
environmental iuues, protection of the 
coa.t, air quality, open apace, the 
whole growth management kind of 
issue, so we had an active campaign on 
all the campuses. I did very, very well 
on the college campuses and it 
provided an added margin. I got 59% 
of the vote, which i. a miracle against 
an incumbent in San Diego politics. 

We have a real interesting issue

how Los Angeles became Los

Chinatown, other than the detective

Itory about the flavor of the times, how 
LA just went out and stole the water 
from the Owens Valley people. 

Mulholland; and those guys at the 
time, Dohihi and some of the others 
bought up all the San Fernando Valley 
land when it was nothing because there 
was no water and then stole the water 
and made millions. And although it'. 
not that blatant or personal in San 
Diego, the fact is the engineering feata 
of previous generations in bringing 
water hundreds of miles through the

Bakke Overruling 'Ruuses Minority Ire 
BYCarol~~ Sacramento ent 

Three Black lobby group. blasted last week's high 
court ruling on minority admiuions as a "blatant 
attempt to further diacrimination and racial abuse" 
yesterday. 

The groups, the California Legislative Black 
Caucus, the NAACP and the California Asaociation 
of Black Lawyers, hit the DeRonde vs. University of 
California appeals court ruling which invalidates 
minority admiaaions programs at UC law schools. 

"We view this decision as a serious setback for the 
status of minorities across the country, if not more 10 
than the Bakke case," said Elihu Ham. (D· 
Berkeley), a '72 Davi. law graduate. 

Harris laid de.pite his high LSA T scores, he 
would not have been admitted to law school had it not 
been for Affirmative Action program •. 

While the US Supreme Court ruled in the Bakke 
case that QUotas were illegal, it laid race may be 
considered as one of the many fadors determining an 
applicant'. admiaaioh. 
. but the 2·1 decision handed down last Monday br 

the Third District Court of Appeals said that the UC 
9avi. Law School'. , consideration of race to offset 
lower grade points constituted a p,reference for 
minorities which was "discriminatory' and therefore 
in violation of the .tate con.titution. 

The original ruling in the Yolo County <court in 
1976 that white applicant Glen DeRonde's grade. 
and LSA T acores were not equitable with those of 
other studenta admitted was made by Judge James 
A. Changari., whose daughter had been rejected by 
UC Davis Law School'. Admissions Committee. 

Nathaniel Colley, regional counsel for the West 
Coa.t chapter of the NAACP and perhaps 
Sacramento's best known lawyer, called the decision 
"a classic example of gratuitous arrogance and 
unforgivable ignorance. Arrogant, because these 
judge. assume they can tell the minorities of America 
at what pace we must be able to go forward in 
aociety; and ignorant because the decision does not 
conform with either the federal or state con.titution. 

"The Bakke case made one thing perfectly clear. 
Race, religion, and sex can be used as a factor when 
aociety is trying to correct the effects of past 
discrimination," said Colley. 

The appeals COltrt justices George E. Paras and 
Robert K. Puglia justified their overruling of the 
Bakke , case because "the Supreme Court just 
intellectualized them.elves into' decisional 
obscurity. " 

Their decilion also stated, "only ti~, patience 
and dogged exploitation of the fundamental 
birthright will bring about insured equal 
proportionality. " 

Legal Aid Society's Attomey Frank J. Ochoa 
proteated the DeRonde decilion because it reaches 
far beyond the legal framework of the case it was 
supposed t:> judge, f:':1' whether or not a white 
male student was re admission to UC Davis 
Law School because of hi. race. 

" It constitutes a deformation of all ~ minority 
graduates of UC Davis Law School, based on the 
illogical assumption that the minority .tudents were 
accepted because of the ethnic factor and not on 
merit," said Ochoa. 

"It also doe. a great deal of damage to the 
reputation of UC which in fact, never lowered its 
standard. of admission," added Mel T uagillo, a local 
attorney and UC Davi. Law School graduate. 

"The use of such phraaea as 'chosen people,' 'pro· 
(euionaUy inferior' and 'mediocrity' in the judge's 
deci.ion demonstrably perpetuate racial hatred and 
.trife," said Ramona Annstead, an attorney for the 
Sacramento Aasociation of Black Attorney •. 

The group at the press conference had 
unaucce.sfully petitioned for an intervening goal in 
thi. case so that it could introduce .uch te.timony a. 
the actual admission. process at UC Davis Law 
School, which the court asaumed to be favorably 
biased toward minorities, a. well as the validity of

'Persian Dust' Hooking Middle Class 
By MarY Claire Blakeman 

The match nares up beneath the tin foil 
and the tannilh golden powder begins to 
bubble. At it melta, running down a 
Create in the foil, ita fumes are inhaled 
through a .lver maw. The ritual i. called 
"chasing the dragon." 

Mary Claire Blakeman is an editor of 
the Pacific News Service. 

But for many who take part. in this 
chaae-young, middle clau, upwardly 
mobile American.-the dr~on tumsinto 
a monkey on their backs. The powder i. 
Persian dust, some of the purest heroin to 
hit this country in rears. 

As ita name implies, the drug is coming 
in from the Mideast-mainly Iran, 
Afghani.tail and Pakistan. For now, it is 
primarily a California phenomenon. 

Smoking the Persian repre.ents a .hifl 
not only in the way heroin is uaed, but allO 
in who i. using it. Ita conlUlTlera are 
ahowing up in heroin detoxification 
centers from Oakland to Lo. Angeles, 
and they are breaking the .tereotYpe of 
the addict. 
. "What we're getting now are people 
who are making it-.traight, middle cla .. 
people, achievement· oriented people," 
said Lee deBarro., executive director of 
the Marin T reatrnent Center in San 
Rafael. 

"We're teeing it go from two or three in 
a neilhborhood to eight or ten," adds Dr. 
OaviC! Deikh, chief of IUbatance abute

HOlpitai. And thoae neighborhooda are in

One ecenario .bout the .. owth of 
. ...... ct... .......... haIda thatje4 

set Iranians turned their American friends 
on to the drug in places like Marin County 
and Westwood. Some of theae Iranians, 
who escaped Iran along with the Shah, 
carried their own drug .whe. a. well a. a 
cultural heritage in which 1II10king opiates 
was almost as acceptable a. the three. 
martini lunch is in this country. 

In fact, during the reign of the Shah, 
older opium uaen could get a monthly 
supply through a government vending 

'Straight, middle 
class, achievement-
oriented' people ' 

.ystem. Dr. Forest TeMant, executive 
director of Community Health Projecta in 
East Los Angeles County, says he has 
aeen an increasing number of Iranian 
patienta in the past year. "They get here 
and ask .. 'What drugstore do I buy my 
opium from?' "he said. "And when they 
don't get it, they find themselves having to 
enroll in methado~ program •. " 

It would be easy to blame Iranian 
traffickers for the current inAux of heroin. 
"We are definitely seeing an increaae 01 
Mideast heroin in this part of the world," 
.ay. Daniel Addario, special agent in 
charge of the Drug Enforcement 
Admini.tration in San Franci.co. 
"lbere's a pretty .ubatanbal amount 
corning in." 

Iranians were arreated in all three 
heroin aeizures at San FrancilCo 
International Airport duri", the palt lix 
month.. Thoae arresta netted more than 
five pounds of raw heroin and a fanner 
Iranian citizen had aIeo recently been 

arrested with aeven pounds of the drug in 
Seattle, according to the DEA. 

But while Iranians play a part, a 
combination of factors is at work to 
produce the increased heroin Oow. The 
Golden Crescent-Iran, Afghanistan and 
Paki.tan-experienced a bumper opium 
crop in 1979, with an estimated harvest of 
1,500 tons. That harvest amounted to 
100 times the amount gathered in 
Mexico. Meanwhile, Mexican heroin has 
steadly declined in quality and purity. 

Also, a heroin epidemic has hit Europe 
in the past two yean, with T urkiah guest 
workers providing the main link between 
Middle Eastern prQducers and refiners 
along the revitalized French Connection 
Une. in Western Europe. As with a surplul 
of any product, the glut of heroin in 
Europe has to go somewhere, and the 
target marked is the United Statel, 
D£A official. say. 

"The bottom line is that we have 
500,000 addicll in the United States," 
says Addario. "The demand is here. The 
market is here." 

Market forces asid..e, Addario also says 
"turmoil in that part of the world" has 
increa.ed Middle Eastern drug traffic.

Interference by many

Dr. Robert FISher, a..ooate 
director at Scripps. 

A few forei.BJl countries, like 
Burma and India, altogether 
deny the privilege of 
conducting research off their 
coutIines. Often, Scripps' 6ve 
...... ch vesaels must seek 
clearance for reaearch up to a 
yur in advance. 

"Countrie. often don't give 
permis.ion until the day before 
we sail," reported Robert 
Haines, a lhip captain in 
charge of scheduling. 

Cases of intervention by 
host countries include ' 
interference in the research 
activities themselves. Many 
nations request that 
representatives be present on 
lOard, and several attempt to 
:ontrol the pubtication of data 

gained off their shores. 
''OJ)eTations in Trinidad 

and Tobago waters by U.S.

·colleagues from other 
countries often feel very 
impotent in influencing their 
own governments. About a 
year ago, a joint Mexican·US 
seismic experiment in the Gulf 
of California was turned down, 
apparently because of worry 
that fish would be killed by the 
firing of large charges," Fisher 
says. 

Some of the blame for the 
problems encountered by 
Scripps scientists lie. with the 
US government. In the 
absence of an international 
law of the sea treaty, the US 
has refused to respect the 
claims of 60 coastal nations to 
jurisdiction over scientific 
research conducted within 
200 miles of their shores. The 
State Department recognizes 
a jurisdiction of 12 miles. 

Developing natiori. have 
always · been wary of the 
possibility o·f developed 

nations exploiting the mineral 
resources off their shores, but 
the Pueblo incident in 1968, 
where a US spy ship was 
disguised as a research vessel, 
according to Fisher, "did more 
to destroy the trust and cause 
problems than any other single 
event." 

Fisher believej that the 
United Nations Conference on 
the Law of the Sea win soon 
reach a decillion concerning 
jurisdiction over offshore 
research activities. 

"More and more people in 
other countries are getting 
very weary of this confusion 
and see that we need some 
agreement," says Fisher. 

"Our own scientists chafe 
under these restrictions and it 
degrades their enthusiasm. 
When the hassle becomes too 
much, they find another 
project and place to work."

After Delays, Hospital Sets 
Date for Helicopter Service 

By Peter Mortenten 
Science Editor 

Officials at Univer.ity Hospital have 

~rent1y convinced skeptical .tate health nning repn!lentatives that emergency Iicopter service for the San Diego area is 
necessary, according to Pat Jacoby, public 
information officer for the ~. 

"We ha \Ie gotten aI OW' approvals and 
thought we would be able to start the prosram 
at the end of FebrUary,·but now we ve set a 
start date in March," Jecoby said, explaining 
that a proLIem with ~ement from the 
Motorola Corporation is holding up activation 
of the helicOpter. 

At thi. point, Jacoby predicts that the 
dedication ceremony for the air ambWance 
will be March 17, providing all things go as 
planned. 

"We're charging right along and have 
gotten all the approvals from the .tate we 
need," she added. 

"This will be the first state.approved 
helicopter service in California," Jacoby says. 

When the helicopter is delivered, "it will be 
kept on the pad on top of the outpatient 
center" to be dispatched as necessary in 
emergency situations, .he says. . 

last September, the local Health Systems 
Agency reluctant1y approved the $610,000 . 
needed to get the project underway: In 
November of wt year, undisclosed problem •

patients to the neareat hospital \Vith approved 
landing facilities. 

FlIJurea discuueci late last year indicated 
that, during the helicopter's first year of 
operation, it would save more than 30 live •. 
Many of these lives would be saved due to the 
helicopter's access to the oudying rural areas 
of the counties, said hospital official •.

Plans to restore the G.H. 
Scripps Memorial Marine 
Laboratory, the oldest facility 
of its kind in the nation, were · 
announced last week by 
Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography associate 
directors Fred Spiess and 
George Shor. 

The laboratory, a two· story 
structure located near the 
beach on the Scripps campus, 
was the first permanent 
structure there, built in 1909. 
Its laboratories, classrooms 
and office s):>aces were 
vacated in 1977 due to 
seismic instability of the 
building. 

"The renovated structure 
will not be just a monument," 
said Spiess, "Our intent is to 
retain the· laboratory as a 
center for national and 
international programs in 
oceanography, hoUling both 
visiting scienti.ts and lOme 
Sa-ipp. staff." 

The construction contract, 
awarded to E.F. Couvrette 
COMtruction Company of La 

Mesa,calIsforthec~tion 
of the fint stage of n!novation 
by -July 10. This first stage of 
n!lIoration work; whida begins 
before the end of J~ r 
·incIudes structural reinforce-
'ment, conformalv;t!' with fire 
and safety codes. and 
upgrimng of basic electrical ' 
.y.tems. 

''R1e total cost of the project 
is expected to be about 
$400,000. Of that amount, 
Shor said only about 
$250,000 have been raised. 

"The money that we have 
already has come in little bits 
and pieces, from $5 to 
$25,OOO-mostly on the' low 
end," Shor explained. 

"The remainder we're 
trying to raise jUit the way we 
raised the rest of. it," he said, 
adding tha t the large 
contributions thus far have 
corne from member. of the 
Scripps famil), and companies 
involved in oceanography. 

According tQ Shor, 
$72,650 of the funds for the 
building came from federal 
historic pre.ervation funds 
administered by the California 
Office of Historic Preserva· 
tion. To receive the 
preservation funds, the 
building had to be deaiRll8ted 
as a Hiatorical Landmark on 
the basi. of its pioneering 
architecture and eervice to the 
development of science and 
education. 

"The acceptance of the 
federal money put a 
requirement in that the 
university maintain the 
building for at leut 20 years," 
Shor .aid. The actual 
designation as a hiltorical 
landmark "doesn't do much 
for the building." Shor 
admitted. "but it does let UI put 
up a plaque and makes it 
e1iJiiWe for limited matc:hint 
feeler. hmda-Iike those we 
have already received." 

Once the final restoration of 
the building is conipleted. the 
laboratory's derio"r wiU look 
somewhat like iI cicI when it 
opened 70 yean ago. 

One major change. said 
Shor, is that "the olel second 
floor classroom i. being 
converted into a workroom 
because handicapped access 
rules would make u. make 
major structural changes 10 
the building wouldn't look the 

" same.

8 The Daily Guardian T~y,Jan.29, 1980 

Hedgecock Keeps County Focus on Energy 
Continued from pate- 1 
NCWQ, and it'. pretty dear that there 
it no water. 

The city council i. approving this 
and then going on faith thatlOmehow 
or other there will be a sufficient waler 
supply, that somehow or other we 11 
figure out how to treat the sewage and 
build the neceqary school. and the 
funding rnechanilm will do that. All 
that i. wishful thinking rather than 
.ood planning. I really object to it 
,trongly. If we're going to try and 
fashion a future for San Diego that 
makes sense in an energy shortage 
situation and a future that make. sense 
environmentally and in term. of waler 
and sewage, then . we have to get 
Ierioua about. . this planned 
urban 'prawl tha~ty of San Diego 
calla crowth management. 

G: What will NeW 11M for 
~ "'lment, for eump/e? 

Here', how the city is handIina it. 
n., have a plant that', rated at 120 
...... pions a day. Its running at 
135.140 miIion~. They've 
......., aIowed beyond the 
QllKity 01 .... plant. They say, "well 
.. M" to ....., the .,owIh." 

Cantrut that with the county. We 
line • ccqaIe 01 plants up the north 
COML w .......... ...... 
llac ........ .,..... ..... it 

mea.ure. down the Ia.t remaining 
capacity of the plant. A.. you reach 
certain points, it cuts off certain kind. 
of hookup •. In the end, the remaining 
.mall amounts of capacity are reserved 
for low income housing and senior 
houling and that sort of thing, 10 that 
you don't wind up with just first come 
first served and the rich people get 
hookup. and that's it, rou .top. We're 
actually stopping. We ve come to the 
time when you have a moratoriwr. 
You .imply say there is no more 
sewage capacity. 

The city hal taken quite another 
tack on NCW. They'd simply run it 
through the pipe and say "until you 
give us lOme money we won't have a 
greater sewage treabnent capacity". 
It'. a whole different philosophy. 

G: I. the dty council making Rood 
decision. for San DieRo? 

I think they're good people and 
conscientiou.. I admire anyone who 
geta into politica for $17,000 a year 
and goe. throup the kind of abuse that 
come. with poGtic •. 

They are coHectively .peaking 
however, not addressing the problems 
01 the region with any creativity. For 
instance, we're moving ahead with a 
number of efforts in recycling water for 
qric:ultural use. They're not. We're 
movinl ahead in alternative energy, by 

opposing the nudear alternative in Sun 
Desert and requiring~we're the first 
jurisdiction in the country to do 10-
lolar hot water heaters in the 
unincorporated areas under new 
conltruction. We're the first place 
around us that made luch an incredible 
use of our moniel to help seniors ltay in 
their home. rather than be committed 
to institutuions when they get unable to 
do a lot of housework. 

We send people around to help them 
so they can stay in their aparbnents 
and around their friends so they don't 
have to be institutionalized. We're the 
first people in the country to have taken 
on the oil companies both in our 
administrative proce.. and in the 
courts. We have the toughest vapor 
recovery lawl to prevent the 
hydrocarbons our of ga.oline nozzles 
from going in the air. And last year we 
were the first metropolitan area in the 
county to have our hydrocarbon 
concentrations go down. We've taken 
a number of initiative. that are 
important in a national context 
whereat the city council can't mention 
one. 

G: I. there any institutional reason 
for the ·council'. behavior? 

I think there are a couple of good 
reuona. 'The charter-San Diego i. 
one of the lut citiea that hat a city 

manager form of government. Dallas 
and San Diego are the lalt of the large 
areas. What it means is that in the area 
of real political power, the mayor and 
the city council are ribbon·cutters. 

Mayor Wilson has carved out 
political power for himself wholly 
through the application of his 
personality and through no real 
jurisdictional power. I think that the 
city council is not expected to be 
innovative or creative. It's the city 
manager who's IUpposed to run things. 

~umber two, I do not think you get 
people with any real experience or 

I quality of leadership for $17,000 a 
year. That may lOund like a lot to 
make, but for a po.ition in a 
profe.sional field making IeSI than an 
administrative aide in the City of San 
Diego, Ie .. than anyone would make in 
many technical jobs and fields, there's 
no way they can expect to get anyone 
of ·any real background, education or 
experience. It'. wrong .. 

And then third, the fact that the city 
council memberl are required to run 
citywide in a general election prevents 
areas of the city and the di.tricts in the 
city from growing their own 
repreaentatives who would be more 
interested. And you'd get a greater 
cro .. section if you'd allow different 
people to elect their representatives.
