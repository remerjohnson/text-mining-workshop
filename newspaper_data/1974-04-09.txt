Chancellor to 
Make Final 

Possibility of UCSD Vet 
School--'Still Uncertain' 

T. T Decision 
Meeting yesterday afternoon, the 

UCSD Communications Board approved 
chairman Micheal Weiss' motion that the 
board's recommendations concerning 
the controversial April 2 is~ue of the 
Triton Times be submitted to the 
Chancellor for final decision, and that 
the board's recommendations not 
become public until at least 48 hours 
after the board adjourns. 

Weiss said he had received a letter 
from Vice-<:hancellor for student affairs 
George Murphy containing that 
suggestion, and, citing the Com Board's 
hierarchical position directly below the 
Chancellor's office, offered the 
suggestion for a vote. 

Editor Bucllbinder 

by John Taylor 
A campaign by state 

assemblyman Willie Brown 
(D-San Francisco) is under 
way to locate California's 
second school of veterinary 
medicine at UCSD, but 
Chancellor William 
McElroy warned last week 
that UC President Charles 
Hitch isn't " ready to make a 
decision yet." 

The idea was spawned 
in the legislature rather 
than the UC hierarchy, and 
a recent study by Hitch's 
office suggests expansion of 
the UC Davis facility, and 
initiation of a search 
program to find a site for a 
future veterinary school site 
in Southern California . 

(That course of action was 
reinforced last week, when 
the Senate Finance 
CommitteevotedS200,OOO to 
the University of California 
for use in a search for 
possible sites.) UCSD, UC 
Riverside and UC Irvine are 
mentioned as possibilities. 

Brown, chairman of the 
Assembly Ways and Means 
Committee, said last month 
he expected money to be 
included in the new state 
budget for construction of a 
bet school at UCSD. The 
committee's ammended 
version of Governor 
Reagan 's S9.8 billion state 
budget will appear in May. 

"We figured we need a 
(veterinary) school in the 

south," he said . "We found 
a willing chan cellor 10 San 
Diego and the San Diego 
legislative delegation is 100 
percent in favor of It " 
McElroy said last week that 
Brown's office had con-
tacted him , and , " Ob-
viously, I said 'yes.' There 
would be no point in saying 
'no' ." 

The Chancellor did 
comment that the proxim ity 
of the San Diego Zoo and 
the Del Mar Race track 
would aid any veterinary 
research in the area. Brown 
listed other advantages of a 
UCSD site.

The motion before the board calls for 

the dismissal of Triton Times editor-in-
chief David Buchbinder and four other 
staff members for their contributions to 
the April Fool 's issue. The paper has, 
since publication of that issue, been 
accused of racism and insensitivity to 
issues concerning Third World students 
on campus. Buchbinder has maintained 
that the articles were intended as attacks 
against the UCSD administration and its 
treatment of Third College. 

dismiss a medium's executive was not 
subject to the greivance hearing rule, but 
that the part ot the motion dealing with 
the four staff members was, because of a 
bylaw requiring, notification of the 
greivance hearing 5 days in advance. 
Buchbinder then accepted Bookman's 
request to waive notification, but 
required that the meeting in progress 
become a greivance hearing. The board 
agreed .

Procedure Complaints 

Following approval of the motion to 
submit the board's recommendations to 
Chancellor McElroy, the board moved 
IOto executive session to hear testimony 
in the matter. At press time, the board 
was still in session . 

Before the vote, Editor Buchbinder 
stated that the motion to dismiss was out 
of order, because the Com Board bylaws 
required for greivance hearing to be held 
before a motion to dismiss can be ac-
cepted. Com Board legal counsel Mark 
Bookman responried that a motion to 

Weiss also read letters from the three 
college provosts. Muir Provost John 
Stewart condemned the "outrageousness 
and crudeness" of the April Fool's issue, 
and declared the people responsible to 
be "out of touch ." Revelle Provost 
Muarry Goodman requested an op-
portunity to review the matter from his 
office before final decision, because of 
the importance of the paper's future to 
Revelle. Third College provost Joseph 
Watson requested a formal review of the 
issue, and stated that it couldn't be 
"dismissed as a prank." 

La Jolla Towing logged 
the first car to be towed 
from North Torrey Pines 
Road into their lot at 7:47 
Thursday morning . This 
action was taken at the 
request of the San Diego 
Police Department in order 
to clear the street for 
repaving. 

The SDPD said that signs 
had been placed along the 
road for four days previous. 
In addition, they notified 
the Campus Police that 
towing would happen to 

Area ot Black's Beach Cool for Nudists 
by Mary Pat Huxley 

The San Diego City Council recently declared that 
swimsuits are now optional beachwear along a 900-foot 
section of Black's Beach. Th@ city ordinance has ruled in 
favor of nude bathing in the secluded northern section 
of Black's, between Box Canyon and Torrey Pines. 
Bathing in the buff was banned by the ordinance at all 
other San Diego public beaches for persons over 10 
years of age. 

Councilman Floyd Morrow summed up the general 
reaction to the ruling. "It's probably a pretty good 
<>rdinance when both sides attack 'it, " he said . . 

Much of the opposition to nude bathing at Black's has 
come from residents of the La Jolla Farms community. 
Prior to the City Council meeting, the San Diego Union 
(April 3) published an article on the subject, in which 
Lawrence F. O'Donnell, a resident of La Jolla Farms, 
expressed his opinion . 

He agreed that the State Supreme Court decision of 
1972, which allows nudity on inaccessible beaches, 
eems straightforward enough. O'Donnell reasoned, 

however, that Black's Beach is not inaccessible. "On 
any given sunny Saturday or Sunday in season," he says 
"2000 to 3000 people can be .seen at Black's .. . Black'~ 
Beach is public and accessible by the simple criterion of 
the crowds who visit it." 

A condition sought by the ,La Jolla Farms 
Homeowners Association was approved by councilmen 
at the meeting, that steps will be taken to avoid traffic 
problems in their neighborhood. 

In the same San DiPgo Union article (April 3), Paul K. 
Sch lapper, a resident of Mission Beach, considered it 
on ly natural that a larle number of nude bathers ap-
pared at Black's, and that the number was probably 
growing. 

At the council meetinl, hours of testimony were 

heard before the ordinance was passed, including Bible 
quotes from both sides and 85-year-old Rolland Reed 
who said he still sunbathes in the buff . 

Some beachgoers, applauding the ci ty's efforts, were 
in favor of extending the area at Black's from 900 feet 
(about one-fifth of a mile) to three miles . Others sought 
the establishment of additional zones, particularly at 
the foot of Ladera Street at Point Loma. This beach is 
very near Point Loma College, and the president there, 
W. Shelbourne Brown appeared to be a~ong those in 
favor of a single special zone for nude bathing. 

Others, such as Happiness of Womanhood (HQW), 
declared that public nudity is part of a declining public 
morality.

Thursday and Friday . 
Campus Police claimed that 
the Resident's Deans of all 
three colleges were notified 
in advance . The Muir 
Residence Office agreed, 
but Revelle said that no 
notice was given . Third 
College's Resident Dean 
cou ld not be sure if notice 
was given because of his 
secretary's absence. 

A charge of S16 for 
towing and S2 per day will 
have to be paid to La Jolla 
Towing, 7545 Drap~r in L 
Jolla, for release of cars. 

The study by Hitch's 
office proposes expansion 
of UCD's vet school size 
from its present 96 to 180 by 
1980. At that point, the 
report suggests, a fac ility 
oriented toward pract ical 
application of theory 
should be established in 
Southern California. The 
report suggests that the site 
for the new facility be UC 
Irvine.

The C .... m 
Someone streaked the Academy Awards. Just when 

David Niven was about to utter some fatous, fullsome 
remark about either the value of the American Film or 
the value of Elizabeth Taylor, someone zipped right 
behind him and dashed off camera. Niven, of course, 
was ready with a nice pat insult, something about 
'shortcomings', but it didn't lessen the impact of the 
year's one appropriate streak. 

The awards show, like the Grammy night last month , 
was full of all sorts of appealing contradictions that, 
eventually, prove not to contradict at all. Like : Alice 
Cooper and Helen Reddy presenting a Grammy 
together. Paul Simon and Dawn having songs 
nominated within the same catagory. Paul McCartney 
nominated for an Oscar for writing the theme to a james 
Bond film . And Diana Ross reading her childhood's 
experiences off cue cards and talking bubblingly about 
'A Touch of Class' . 

Since it all happened, we wonder . Entertainment is 
just one industry, created, according to Niven, to "keep 
people sane." Art, of course, is secondary. 

And there were other bizarre things. Imagine: 
Telly Savalas singing 'You're Nice To Be Aro\.lnd', 

while smoking. 
Twenty-five dancers performing a glittery 

choreography of 'Live and Let Die', with McCartney 
gazi ng on muddily. 

Most of the dialogue in a scene from 'The Last Detail' 
getting beeped out because, presumably, it is incorrect 
for the television audience. It is difficult to honor a film 
when three-fourths of its dialogue is unsuitable . 

The most illuminating thing about the :\cademy 
Awards, though, is to separate the evening's scattered 
moments of pure, profeSSional class, all of which make 
you want to forget the rest. Both Kathrine Hepburn and 
an emotional Croucho Marx made appearances, 
causing the shoddy representatives of Today's 
Hollywood to stand and applaud in adoration . (It's hard 
to think about 'The Exorcist' or 'The Sting' wh ile 
listening to either of these two people.) At one point, 
when Hepburn said, "I'm living proof that you can wait 
41 years to be unselfish," the audience responded with 
scattered, hesitant applause, indicating to me that they 
either didn't understand or appreciate her remark . I was 
more sure after seeing Ellen Berstein ('The Exorcist') 
scowl and hiss when Glenda jackson was chosen over 
her as best actress, and when AI Pacino ('Serpico') 
applauded his own nomination and sneered when he 
lost . 

It seemed throughout that the older members of the 
industry were a little classier . john Houseman ('The 
Paper Chase') was the only winner to offer an articulate 
and somewhat meaningful statement of thanks (except 
for the winner of the documentary films award, who 
simply said that he hoped the winning of it would help 

. him to do better work in the future) . Tatum O'Neal 
('Paper Moon'), on the other hand, was breathless in the 
perfect Hollywood tradition as she thanked "my 
director." The New Breed . 

The Oscars were less upsetting, in general, than the 
Grammies, because I don't need to be reminded of the 
monolithicness of the movie business. However, it was 
saddening to see the musicians lumped together, as 
they were in the Crammie presentations, though it was 
some concilation to note who the judges chose over 
whom ('Dawn' over Simon), and what was left out of the 
nominations altogether (most of what is vital in 
American music .) 

If you weren't depressed enough after the Oscars, you 
could've tuned in afterwards . There was a sports award 
show that involved a bunch of movie people who were 
apparently left out of the Oscar proceedings entirely. 
On that show, Billie jean King allowed herself, with 
evident enjoyment, to play the straight person to a 
string of Bob Hope's women's lib jokes. It's always 
interesting to watch conviction melt so completely 
under spotlights.

Editor's Note: Much has 
been dilusseel about the 
propoleel "Town Center" 
to be built nellt to the 
university. To my 
know leclae , no one has 
mentioned the necessity of 
constructinl any housinl 
there that would be 
available to row income 
families. It has been im-
plicit that in our capitalist 
sys tem such thinls are 
unfeasible and that the 
poor should be relelateel to 
slum areas of San Dielo so 
that La ,oIlans will noC 
have their cocoon of 
decacence disturbed. The 
following is an article from 
the "Daily Californian" 01 
U.c. Berkeley that shows 
what some people ilre 
trying to do about the 
problem of housing for low 
income people. This is 
Berkeley'S attempt at a 
model for housing that 
obviates the necessity of 
profits. There is no reason 
a similar model could not 
be adopted here. Such a 
model should be imposed 
upon the "T own Center" 
with the help of the 
university community and

Records: Musical Notes Larry Deckel 
Todd-Todd Runsren 
Bearsville Records 

I have to approach this 
album from a historical 
void as I have not really 
heard much of Rundgren's 
previous mater ial either as 
a soloist, or with his two 
bands Nazz and Runt. This 
is attr ibutable to growing 
sickened and disgusted 
with his " We've got to get 
you a woman leroy" which 
permeated am air-waves 
back in my youth . 

But on the bas is of his 
fine reputation as a 
producer I gave a listen to 
his latest offering, " Todd" 
a two record set, and was 
delighted and amazed. 

From the opening 
moment in which an 
electronic voice chops out 
the syllables which ask 
" How about a little fan-
fare" and the electronic 
fanfare which follows 
cleanly seques into a sort 
of keenly produced ballady 
" I think You Know", you 
know you are dealing with 
something other than the 
ordinary pop-star . 

The albums attraction 
lies in i ts non-
predictability . It's style 
range s from heartsy 
ballads " The last Ride" to 
electronic compositions " In

" Everybody's Going to

the " King Kong Reggae" 
complete with massive

Rudgren plays the grass 
major ity of the instruments 
and electronics on the 
album, and yet uses 
sideman as needed and 
avoids that super-pop-star 
image that plagues so many 
abitious record ing artists . 
Rundgren remains very 
much the producer , and 
this makes the big dif-
ference here. One is 
reminded of Zappa in 
terms of this high level of 
production , variety of 
material, and general non-
commercial attack on 
things . 

The philosophical air 
that surrounds things is 
best summed up in the most 
fun cut on the album" An 
Elpee's Worth of Toons": 

" There's something at 
the heart of it that's simply

and " A man would sil1l>ly

Obviously Rudgren is 
that mad, and does try to 
change the world, and we 
get a sense of import as the 
albums last cut has an 
audience at Wollman Rink, 
Central Park and another 
audience in San Francisco 
singing with Rudgren on 
" Son's of 1984". 

This album is certainly 
no crowd pleaser , but is 
rich in dynamiC production 
and comes across as an 
exci ting cacophy of musical 
ideas .

PRETZEL Loc;IC, Steely Din - ABC 0 .... 

With a first lP marked by a concise, limited rock-song 
format and a second by lengthy selections featuring often-
indulgent solos, Steely Dan, on " Pretzel logic," have suc-
cessfully combined the most creative elements of each pr ior 
effort and come up with their most intelligent and enjoyable 
album to date. 

Gone is the obvious " hit-bound" approach of "Can't Buy a 
Thrill" and the excesses of "Countdown to Ecstacy" replaced 
on "Pretzel Logic" by well-arranged, very well-produced 
compositions which generate a much more overall balanced 
sound than before . 

The album is highlighted by " Night by Night" a hard rock 
and roller with a fiery gUitar solo, "Rikki Don't Lose That 
Number", the characteristic Steely cha-cha tune, and the 
cynically witty title song. Also of note is an unusual retake on 
Ellington's 1920's hit, " East St. louis Toodle-oo", and a tribute 
to alto-sax great Charlie Parker entitled "Parker's Band". 

With the exceptions of three distinctively filler-quality 
songs ("With a Gun" , "Charlie Freak", and "Monkey In Your 
Soul"), which close side two, " Pretzel logic" maintains a high 
level of interest, imagination and creativity . 

RATED: GOOD (Rock) 
WINDFALL 'Rick Nelson Ind the Stone unyon Band - MeA-
383 

This is a superficially pleasant but ultimately inconsistent, 
unsatisfying disc of diverse song styles handled by Rick & Co. 
with varying degrees of success. The LP contains-elements of 
rock and roll ("Someone to love" ), reggae ("Windfall"). 
country ballads ("How Many Times"), and latin-rock ("Ev il 
Woman Child" ), which only finally serve to point out and 
contrast the various strengths and weaknesses of Rick, the 
band, and "Windfall ," itself. 

The album's strengths include its capable musicianship, 
tight harmonies, and Rick's own long-standing and continuing 
ability to create a convincing empathy in the performance of 
both ballads and country songs . It's weaknesses relate directly 
to the musical excursions attempted beyond this secure low-
key country-western base . While Rick's vocal talents allow for 
subtle moves in phrasing and for the creation and main· 
tenance of assorted psychological moods, he clearly lacks the 
hard edge in vocal dynamiCS necessary for the production of 
effective and convincing rock and roll . Each attempt fails to 
tran scend even the ordinary, and in the end only aids in 
destroying any sense of flow or view of the album as a near 
harmonious whole .

He sees his electronic

JOHNNY SHINES, Johnny Shines - Advent 2803 

Johnny Shines is one of the few surviving bluesmen playing 
in the Mississippi Delta blues style. His music is marked by a 
thick vocal vibratto reminiscent of Bukka White and a 
proficient slide-guitar technique heavily influenced by the 
legendary Delta bluesman Robert Johnson (author of 
"Cross roads" and " love in Vain"). 

The material on this , Shines' debut Advent album, is nearly 
evenly distributed between urban and country blues. His 
electric guitar/urban blues sound, which smacks stylistically 
of Otis Rush and the late Magic Sam, essentially provides able 
contrast for Johnny's true forte, the country blues performed 
solo with self-accompaniment on acoustic slide-guitar. Each 
of the albums six solo pieces is a unique aural jewel. "To 
Lazy" , "Moaning & Groaning", these and the other solos are 
excellent and contribute to make " Johnny Shines", the album, 
a consistently entertaining, often highly exciting blues set .

The cinematic product of the last Stones U.S. concert

It's been announced that the Allman Brothers Band will

currently touring as a solo artist backed by a 24-piece or-
chestra and 6-piece rhythm section . 

That day-16ng outdoor concert, the "California Jam", held 
April 6 at Ontario Motor Speedway was taped for ABC under 
the direction of Joshua White probably to form four future 
segments of " In Concert".

Holland, in 1970, before 
enrolling in the UCSD 
doctoral program. At

Mac Dougall , who 
studied connposition at the 
Peabody Conservatory of 
Music before enrolling in 
the doctoral program at 
UCS D, wor ks as a forest 
service lookout in Montana 
during the summer . 

He found the title for his 
recorded piece in Webster 
which defines anacoluthon 
as " a sentence which shifts 
from one construction to 
another , as in 'You really 
ought-well, do it your own 
way' ." This concept of 
interfections and sudden 
shifts in direction is central 
to his work . 

According to Mac-
Douga II, "A nacoluthon" is 
not primarily a melodic 
work but, rather , an ex-
plor a tion of degr ees of 
attentiveness . expressed 
through changing 
relationships within the 
ensemble. To this end he 
makes use of conflicting 
tempi and dynamics, and 
the performers are asked 
at var ious times to divorce 
themselves rhythmically, 
dynamically, and timbrally 
fr om one another . 

"This interaction is of 
prime . importance for me 
on both a conceptual and 
social level," MacDougall 
said . " I wanted to create 
situations in which the 
performers were given the 
opportunity to assume 
control Oller certain parts 
of the work, yet I did not 
want to relinquish 
responsibility for the 
cour se of the compos ition 
as a whole. 

" As a result , 
'A na coluthon' has become 
a contrapuntal involvement 
in the largest sense, not 
only for me as a compaser, 
but, I hope, for the per-
former and the listener as 
well," he said .

Summer Intern 
Program 

The State of California Health and Welfare Agency is 
sponsoring an intern program of approximately 200 
summer work assignments which will expose students to 
the environment of a governmental agency. UCSD 
students will be competing for these positions with 
students from forty other colleges and universities; so 
only the most qualified candidates will be nominated. 
Since it is impossible to provide here all of the varieties 
of qualifications these positions require, it will be 
necessary for applicants to check with both the Student 
Employment Office (10 MC) and Career Planning & 
Placement (6012 H&SS, Muir) . The seven departments 
of the Health and Welfare Agency participitting in this 
program are listed below with an indication of which 
campus office is handling that particular group of 
openings.

Department of Benefit Payments (CP&P) 
Department of Corrections (SEO) 
Department of Employment Development (SEO) 
Department of Health (CP&P) 
Department of Rehabilitation (CP&P) 
Department of Youth Authority (SEO) 

Apart from the specialized requirements of each 
position, the basic qualifications for all are: Applicants 
must have at least a 2.5 CPA, be regi.stered this quarter, 
full-time UCSD underllraduate students in good stan-
ding. 

Unfortunately, the final de .. dline for submittina an 
application to one of these two offices (SEO or CP&P) is 
noon on Wednesd .. y, April 10, 1974. There is a strict 
time table by which we must abide, so please apply as
