SAN DIEGO - After a long 
legal tug-of-war between the 
San Diego State University 
administration and City 
Planning Senior Anne Rizzo 
over the destruction of the 
Aztec Bowl, a step has been 
taken toward its preservation. 
The Aztec Bowl was nomi-
nated to the national registry 
of historical sites last month, 
with the State Historical 
Resources Commission 
voting 6-1 in favor of 
nominating it for placement 
on the state list of preserved 
sites.

DAVIS - Several former 
employees of the Davis 
branch of the University and 
State Employees Credit Union 
(U.S.E.) have alleged that the 
union discriminates against 
employees and members. "As 
an e"perienced credit union 
employee, I am more than 
aware of the fair lending 
practices and nondiscrimina-
tory bylaws which credit 
unions are supposed to 
follow," said Cindy Contreras, 
a former loan officer who 
claims to have witnessed and 
experienced discrimination at 
the credit union. "I can assure 
you that U.S.E. does not 
follow these. In fact, they 
blatantly disregard them." A 
spokesman for the credit union 
denied the charges.

Regent in Trouble After 
Senate Committee Vote 

FDA 
Restricts 
UCSD 
Research 

STUDIES: Lee could 
be the first regent since 
Leland Stanford in 
1883 to be rejected for 
UC Board of Regents 
By Jonne '.Imer 
Associate News Editor 

For the first time in more than 
a century, a nominee for the Uni-
versity of California Board of 
Regents was rejected by the Cali-
fomia State Senate. In a 3-2 vote, 
the Senate Rules Committee re-
jected the appointment of Lester 
H. Lee, a Sunnyvale business-
man. The vote was split along 
party lines, with Democrats vot-
ing against Lee. 

Lee, who was appointed by 
Gov. Pete Wilson last year, could 
be the first regent denied a seat on 
the board since Leland Stanford 

in 1883. 
Lee's ousting was orchestrated 

by the Senate's new president pro-
tem, Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), 
reportedly as a reaction to Lee's 
conservative voting habits during 
his year on the Board of Regents. 
Lee, the only Chinese American 
ever to serve on the board, cast 
votes to increase fees and cut 
employee pay raises last year 
while also voting to raise the sala-
ries of certoin top UC administra-
tors. Lee was one of five regents 
to vote against pay increases for 
UC hospital administrators in 
November. 

In spite of his vote on that 
issue, Lee was also cri ticized by 
members of the committee for 
deferring to the decisions of the 
UC Office of the President. 

The governor's office was sur-
prised by the Senate vote. "Dr. 
Lee is exactly the kind :>f person 

HERE'S CALVERT 

we need on the Board of Regents, " 
Wilson said. 

The only way Lee 's appoint-
ment could be resurrected would 
be if the full Senate granted him 
the seat,a motion that has not been 
attempted for many years. At press 
time, there was no indication as to 
whether Lee's supporters would 
initiate a fight on the Senate floor 
this Friday. 

Associated Students Vice Presi-
dent External Nick Endres said he 
knew that Lee would have a hard 
time being appointed by the Sen-
ate. '" think this is indicative of the 
climate ... The regent reform initia-
tives are really beginning to be 
taken to heart by the [California] 
Assembly," Endres said. 

"I've talked with Lee before. 
My impression of him is that he 
really just seems to take the word 
of the Office of the President for 
granted," Endres added.

As a result of the recent University of 
California budget cuts and across-the-board 
fee increases voted for by the Board of Re-

demanding union representation by the Uni -

tor Elliot Kamin last week to be 
tbe A.S. representative to the

"[The A.S. ] was under the im-

Former Model Speaks 
Out Against Media 
LECTURE: Simonton discusses media exploitation 
as part of UCSD's International Women's Week 
By IVIIII Delventhal 
Staff Writer 

Ann Simonton, the former 
model who now heads Media 
Watch, gave a slide presentation 
Tuesday night about the way in 
which the media presents 
exploitive portrayals of women. 

Simonton, who appeared on the 
covers of both Sports 
Illustrated and Sev-
enteen in the early 
'70s before she be-
gan her campaign 
against exploiti ve 
images, spoke to an 
audience of approxi-
mately 300 students 
as part of UCSD's 
Int e rnational 
Women's Week. 

to educate that audience. 
"There is a freedom of com-

mercial speech in America, " said 
Simonton, adding that many indi-
viduals do not have the means to 
exercise their First Amendment 
rights. "Everyone should have ac-
cess to freedom of speech, not just 
those who can afford 'It." 

Many of 

One of the pri-
mary goals of Media 
Watch is to show that 
"education must be 
used to bring about 
social change. It is 
necessary to help 
stop violence against 
women and men," 
Simonton said. 

"In order to 
maintain the 

Simonton ' s 
slides dealt with 
the way women 
are transformed 
into sex objects 
by the commer-
cial industry. 
Simonton 
showed that 
women are fre-
quently por-
trayed as submis-
sive and vulner-
able, which is a 
dangerous repre-
sentation because 
it reinforces the 
"woman as vic-
tim" stereotype 
that already ex-
ists in society. 

Simonton spoke 
briefly of her own 
career as a model, 
which began at age 
14 when she worked 
as the trophy girl at a 
racetrack. Simonton 
called it a humiliat-

statu. quo, you 
must teach men 
to be violent, 
and you must 
also teach 
women that It In addition, Simonton dis-

cussed the preva-
lence of violence

victim. and 
that they 
deserve to be 
hurt." ing experience 

which "typified what 
women have to put 
up with in society. 
We must swallow our humilia-
tion." 

From there, Simonton went on 
to beauty pageants and modeling. 
At age 18, she appeared on the 
cover of Seventeen, and it was 
around this time that Simonton 
was gang-raped at knife-point on 
her way to a modeling interview. 

Although the experience was 
extremely traumatizing, she con-
tinued modeling, appearing on the 
cover of Sports Illustrated. How-
ever, Simonton said she had very 
low self-esteem and was suicidal. 

Since then, Simonton has be-
come a self-described radical femi-
nist, who tours the country, chal-
lenging stereotypical ideas held 
about beauty, violence and the ef-
fects of advertising. 

Through her slide presentation, 
Simonton illustrated the way in 
which advertisers present their au-
diences with very specitic notions 
of what it means to be beautiful. 

According to Simonton, adver-
tisers seek a passive, receptive 
audience, She said that she hopes 

havior in children 
-Ann SImonton and adults," said 

Former Model Simonton, add-
ing that many ad-

vertisers have subtly incorporated 
the notions of sex and violence 
into their campaigns. 

"In order to maintain the status 
quo, you must teach men to be vio-
lent, and you must also teach women 
that it is sexy to be victims and that 
they &serve to be hurt," Simonton 
said. 

Simonton said she is not against 
all modeling, but added that those 
who choose that field should be 
fully aware of what they're doing 
to themselves as well as to soci-
ety. They should realize that they 
are perpetuating the existing sys-
tems of exploitation and violence 
against women, she said. 

Simonton concluded by saying 
that one of her most important 
goals is to reach a point where 
"women are judged by what 
they've done in society, rather than 
what they look like." 

The presentation was (oJlowed 
by a "Take Back the Night" march 
in which women walked to the 
various campus residence halls to 
rally support (or women's rights.

UCSD Launches Glaucoma Study 
The National Eye Institute has launched the first 

multl-eenter, kIf1t-term study to determine whether 
glaucoma can be prevented or delayed in people with 
ocular hypertension through early use of prescription 
eyedrops which haVe proven effective In the safe 
treatment of glaucoma. 

The Shiley Eye Center at UCSO is one of 21 clinical 
centers in the study and is currently seeki,. volun-
teers. 

"People with ocular hypertension - a higher-than-
normal pressure within the eye - may not even know 
they have a potential problem," said Robert N. 
Weinreb, director of the Ocular Hypertension Study at 
UCSD. 

"But this common condition In people over the 
age of 40 Is believed to be one of the leading risk 
factors for glaucoma - one of the most common 
causes of blindness In the United States." added 
Weinreb, who Is also a professor and vice chairman 
of the Department of Ophthalmology at UCSO's 
Shiley Eye Center. 

Nearly eight percent of Americans over age 40 
experience eye pressure, and approximately three 
million Americans suffer from glaucoma_ People with 
diabetes and high blood pressure are at higher risk for 
ocular hypertension and glaucoma. The disease also 
runs In families and is more common among people of 
African ancestry. 

According to Weinreb, clear fluid bathes the Inside 
of the eye and normally drains out of the eye as more 

Is produced. If drainage slows or Is blocked, excess 
fluid causes elevated pressure Inside the eye. Glau-
coma occurs when excess fluid damages the optic 
nerve at the back of the eye, which carries visual 
Information from the eye to the brain. 

"Published studies are almost equally divided be-
tween those that find earty use of preScription eyedrops 
to be effective In preventing or delay!,. glaucoma In 
ocular hypersensetlves and those that do not," said 
Weinreb, noting that prior studies suffered from such 
limitation as small sample size and relatively short-
term follow-up. 

"Althougll there are no scientifically grounded 
gult1ellnes to follow In deciding on treatment for these 
patients, some 1.5 million people with ocular hyper-
tension are being treated with costly medications 
that carry the potential for serious side effects," he 
said. 

Over the next two years, 1,500 people with ocular 
hypertension, Including 400 or more African Ameri-
cans, will be enrolled In the study and followed for at 
least five years. 

Patients will be randomized to close observation 
only or to medical treatment with prescription eyedrops 
which have lore term In safely used for the treatment 
of glaucoma. No experimental drugs will be used. 

"If a patient develops 8lrJ eye problem, doctors In 
the study are likely to spot It right fJWay," Weinreb said. 
"Arty patient whO shows even the earliest signs of 
developing glaucoma will be treated promptly." 

ERRATA 
In "GSA Presents Autonomy Bid to Administration" (Feb. 28), the GlUlrdiDn incorrectly referred to 

a 1972 precedent-setting case at UC Riverside. The decision in that case recognized students as a legal 
entity. The GlUlrdUin regrets the error.

Calvert DeForrest Faces Life 
Mter Larry: 'Bud' Mehnan 
TOUR: Late night 1V 
star visits UCSD as part 
of CBS promotion 
By PhIlIp MIc ...... 
News Editor 

John Mosseau, who handles 
promotions for CBS, has a few 
words of advice for anyone inter-
viewing Calvert DeForrest, the 
diminutive character actor who has 
developed a cult following as 
David Letterman's comic foil. 

"Don't ask him his age," said 
Mosseau, explaining that every re-
porter who has interviewed 
DeForrest during this latest CBS 
College Tour promotion has asked 
the question, much to the actor's 
chagrin. 

So when DeForrest made an 
appearance at UCSD on Tuesday 
afternoon, the dreaded question 
went unasked. Who, after all, 
would be foolish enough to tempt 
the wrath of a man noted for his 
appearances on "The Late Show 
With David Letterman" , and as-
sorted commercials? 

It would be hard to imagine 
DeForrest as anything but the jo-
vial actor who signed autographs 
and posed for photographs with 
UCSD students at Revelle Plaza on 
Tuesday. DeForrest has reason to 
be happy - his appearances on 
Lettennan 'stop-rated "Late Show" 
are identified by many to be some 
o( the show's funniest moments. 

"It ' s the best move that could 
ever have happened," DeForrest 
said of Letterman's much publi-
cized move from NBC to CBS this 
summer. 

DeForrest may be better known 
by his stage name - Larry "Bud" 
Melman - which he used back in 

UPTE: UCSD 
employees criticize 
state of university 
Continued from ,... 1 
announce the filing for election with 
the Public Relations Board. 

According to UPTE/CW A sec-
tion9119(SanDiegoCounty)Presj-
dent Jelger Kalmijn, UPTE mem-
bers are currently in San Francisco 
delivering the signatures of about 
1,500 of the 3,500 employees. 

"We think this is extremely 
important, as of right now, given 
the budget crisis here at UCSD 
and at the whole University of 
California. It's especially critical 
that we have some kind of official 
means to represent ourselves," 
Kalmijn said. 

In effect, winning a union elec-
tion would allow UPTE to negoti-
ate with regent board members and 
bargain for a contract that would 
recognize the finer points of griev-
ance procedures and negotiate wage 
cuts, layoffs and health benefits. 

According to Kalmijn, without 
such representation, the univer-
sity will continue to esploit its 
employees. 

"At this point, the regents can 
basically do whatever they want 
to our personnel policies - they 
can Ily us off whenever they want, 
they can cut our wapa, our health 
benefits, and we have no lepl 
recourse becauae we Ire com-
pletely uncqanized. So it's criti-
cal that we orpnize ourselves into 
I union," he aaid. 

the days when Letterman's show 
was on NBC. However, when 
Leiterman switched networks, 
NBC claimed the name "Larry 
'Bud ' Melman" as its intellectual 
property, and DeForrest was forced 
to relinquish the na~e. 

Nevertheless, people still call 
DeForrest by his stage name. "I 
don't think you can sue everyone 
for it," he said. 

"I like my real name," DeForrest 
added. "It's nice to get it back again. 
But I enjoyed being Larry." 

DeForrest has been with 
Letterman since the latter's lare-
night debut in 1982. When two of 
Letterman's writers showed him a 
film they had made as students ,at 
NYU which featured DeForrest, 
I.:.etterman hired the character ac-
tor instantly. 

Since then, Melman has been a 
mainstay on the late-night program, 
doing memorable comedy bits like 
his rendition of Elvis Presley 's 
"Hunk-a Hunk-a BumingLove" and 
his infamous goodwiU tour, in which 
DeForrest attempted to drive from 
New York City to Tierra Del Fuego 
in South America. 

"I went as far as Guatemala," 
DeForrest said. " It was supposed 
to be a goodwill tour, but after you 

According to Kalmijn, mis-
gu ided budget priorities of the state 
of California and the Board of 
Regents have resulted in a 3.5 per-
cent pay cut for employees and a 
three-year delay of merit increases 
and cost of living adjustments. 
Even if the employees are initially 
promised wage increases and ben-
efits, the gains are still subject to 
the constant fluctuation of the 
governor's budget. 

"Now [they say) we're going to 
get it, but then [these factors are] 
also dependent on the governor's 
budget, which includes getting 
millions of dollars in federal aid 
which we will probably not get. So 
I wouldn't be surprised if once 
again, while they promised us a 
merit increase. they go back on 
their wqrd, just like they did last 
year," Kalmijn said. 

Kalmijn added that the morale 
of the university as a whole is suf-
fering, and consequently, the em-
ployees receive the hard end of it. 

"We understand [that] the pay 
cuts and the layoffs [are] not onJy 
a reaction to fisal constraint and 
economic hardship but an actual 
altered vision - that the regents 
are trying to change the master 
plan for education, .. he said 

In addition, Kalmijn said that the 
applicant acceptance rate has now 
dropped from 125 percent to only 
the top 10percent ofCalifomia high 
acboolaeniors. This proportionally

leave the Winnebago and have to 
change to a car and you're travel-
ing through all these small Mexi-
can towns, and then from there, 
you get to Guatemala, they tell 
you [that] you can't use the car, 
you have to go by bus .... It seemed 
like it took forever to get to Guate-
mala City." 

The tour ended after one of 
television's stranger moments, 
when a feverish DeForrest 
pleaded with Letterman over the 
phone to be allowed to come 
home. "He said, 'Don ' tbeababy, 
Larry, .. ' De Forrest said. 

But DeForrest said he has no 
regrets about any of his appear-
ances on Letterman's two shows 
and that he has never refused to do 
a sketch with which the writers 
have come up With. " I never veto 
anything. David says do it, that' s 
it," DeForrest said. 

His success on late night has 
propelled DeForrest into other 
ventures. He plays a nasty acting 
coach in the movie Mr. Write, 
which debuts in May and co-stars 
Paul Reiser and Martin Mull. 

DeForrest also wrote a book, 
Calverl DeF orresl's CheapAdvice, 
which will hit bookstores this (all. 
DeForrest declined to talk about 
the book's content. "It 's cheap, but 
not (ree. I don 't give away secrets," 
he said, punctuating the sentence 
with his trademark laugh. 

DeForrest has no explanation 
for his popularity with viewers. 
"Maybe it 's because they feel I' m 
a friend, an uncle, or I don't know, 
however you want to put it. Some-
one they can trust and confide in," 
DeForrest said, 1

Many of us who work here will not 
be able to send our kids here for 
financial reasons, as the fees at

Since San Diego is not consid-
ered a bastion of union ism, 
Kalmijn added that union recruit-
ment is often difficult. But current 
union breakthroughs, such as 
Telcommunications Administra-
tive Analyst Michael Goh 's in-

Clinton Welfare Plan Is 
Discriminatory 

Bill Ointon has gotten away with what Dan Quayle never could. 
While Quayle was verbally stoned for his attacks on Murphy Brown's 
"glamorization of single motherhood," President Ointon h. been able 
to point the finger at unwed mothers in a way that's more palatable to 
the American public. 

As part of his effort to fulfill his campaign promise to "change 
welfare as we know it," President ainton recently released some key 
details of his proposed welfare reform package. The thrust of the plan, 
of course, is to get' em off the dole, into the job market and out of the 
vicious cycle of poverty. And not surprisingly, one of the primary 
groups targeted for refonn is single mothers - in particular, teenage 
single mothers. 

At the heartofOinton'swelfare reform package is thetwo-year "up-
and-out" plan, which would cut off welfare benefits to those recipients 
born after 1970 at the end of a two year period. However, it would also 
provide job training and temporary government employment (prima-
rily at minimum wage). Under the plan, recipients born before 1970will 
be eligible to remain on welfare as long as necessary. 

Money is one reason why young recipients are singled out. Because 
preliminary estimates for the job-training program were extremely high 
(as much as $14.5 billion per year), the Ointon administration decided 
that, instead of fighting for a comprehensive job-training proposal 
which could benefit all welfare recipients, it will simply target young 
people born after 1970. 

This two-year plan was flawed from the outset. While it sounds good 
in theory (the time limit would provide a nice "incentive" to push people 
into the job market and the training program would pick up the slack), 
many people will fall through the cracks. There are a number of reasons 
for this: the general inefficiency of government programs, the de-
pressed job market (there are more people than jobs) and the difficulty 
of finding entry-level jobs which pay a livable wage (the government 
jobs are of this kind). While a job-training program 'would be highly 
beneficial, making this service contingent on a tw~year welfare limit 
is unreasonable and unnecessarily punitive. 

More fundamentally , by forcing the young off welfare after two 
years and not giving older recipients the benefit of job training, the 
proposal discriminates on the basis of age. The message sent to older 
recipients is clear: they are less useful to society. In essence,"You can ' t 
teach an old dog new tricks." 

The most problematic aspect of the proposal are the guidelines 
which it sets for young, unwed mothers. To be eligible for welfare 
benefits under the Clinton plan, teenage mothers and mothers-to-be 
must live at home with their parents. Accordingto the administration, 
by keeping young mothers at home - and under the guidance of their 
parents - they are less likely to perpetuate the cycle of poverty and 
welfare dependency. While the logic itself .is questionable, the real 
problem is how it will affect these mothers. Quite simply, it puts many 
women in a double bind. What ~appens to young mothers whose 
parents are abusive? Or runaway and homeless teens? It's highly 
unreasonable to cut these women from the roles - especially since 
they're the ones who are most likely to need financial assistance. 

The Clinton administration should kill the two-year plan and begin 
pursuing the implementation of job training and day care for all women 
- young and old. If we really want to "change welfare as we know it, " 
welfare should be based on the goal of helping people escape poverty 
by providing the necessary stepping stones (e.g. education, training and 
services) andÂ·nolby threatening to take these stones away.

Thumbs Up to the 
GSA .â€¢â€¢ 

... for taking real steps toward autonomy. For years, UCSD student 
governments have talked about gaining autonomy from the administra-
tion, but nobody has Â· ever really foJlowed through. The Graduate 
Student Association (GSA), with the helpofGSA Autonomy Represen-
tative Patrick Carroll-Burke, has drafted a concrete proposal which 
would give the organization freedom from administrative oversighl 

This freedom is warranted for a number of reasons. The GSA is not 
made up of children. Graduate students can make their own decisions 
and are among the most educated of the American public. They don't 
need parental guidance. Further, interest in student government on 
campus is pathetically low. If student representatives were actually 
given an iota of actual power, more students might get involved in the 
process. Hopefully, the administration and GSA will reach an agree-
ment by the end of the year.

A GREEN LIGHT TO BIGOTRY 
COMMENTARY: Despite his well-known hate-mongering, Rev. Louis 
Farrakhan is being invited to a national summit of African-American leaders 
By Rob levinson 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Imagine if you will: The senior spokesman for the 
Jewish DefCftSe L.eague(n>L)makesaspeecbata univer-
sity in which he says, among other ~ that blacks are 
sucking the blood of the Jewish community, that Jesse 
Jackson is a' fat-lipped, watennelon- and fried chicken-
eating imposter who controls the White House, that Arab 
women and children should be killed as well as the 
handicapped and homosexuals. The head of the 101.., 
responding to pressure from Jewish leaders and politi-
cians, stands by "the truths that he spoke," 
but condemns the "manner in which 
those truths were represented." Shortly 
thereafter, Ihe Anti-Defamation League 
ofB'nai B'rith (ADL) announces that it 
will hosl a national summit of Jewish 
leaders and will include the leader of the 
JDL 

Sound ridiculous? Of course it does. 

and a German in his own country would almost have to go 
to a Jew to get money. The Jews had undermined the very 
fabric of the society." 

Lest he leaw anyone out, Muhammed included Catho-
lies in his diatribe: "Go to the Vatican in Rome when the 
old no-good pope, you know, that cracker - somebody 
need to raise that dress up and see what's really under 
there." He referred to Alan Greenspan, the chainnan of the 
Federal Reserve as "the hook-nosed, bagel-eatin' lox-
eatin' imposter" who "owns the Federal Reserve" and 
"control[s] that seat [in the White House] that they sit in 

from behind the scenes." 

The ADL has a long history of fighting 
alJ forms of bigotry and racism in the 
United States and around the world and 
would never embrace anyone espousing 
hatred. However, another organization, 
with an equally distinguished record in 
combatting prejudice, is doing just that 
by inviting Louis Farrakban to its na-
tional summit. I'm speaking of the Na-
tional Association for the Advancement 
of Colored People (NAACP). 

If you think tbis an exaggeration, 
consider the speech delivered by Khalid 
Abdul Muhammed, an official spokes-
man for Farrakban's Nation of Islam 
(NO!) at Keane College. Speakingabout 
whites in South Africa, Mubarnmedsaid, 
"We give the white man 24 hours to get 
out of town by sundown. Ifhe don't get 
out before sundown we kill everything 
that ain't right in sight in South Africa." 

The speech was replete with this sort 
of hate-mongering, and it's no suprise 
thatJesse Jackson, Benjamin Chavis and 
a host of other African-American leaders 
condemned the speech and demanded 
that Farrakhan renounce Muhammed. 
Responding to this pressure, Farrakhan 
removed Muhammed from his post and 
generously said, "While I stand by the 
truths that he spoke, I must condemn ... 
the manner in which those truths were 
represented." Some were satisfied, but 
many, understandably, were not. Just 
what did Farrakhan mean by the "truths 
that he spoke?" That all the whites in 
South Africa should be killed? That the 
Jews were really to blame for the Holo-
caust? Sadly, I think Famkhan truly 
believes most of what Mohammed said 
- and his record proves it. 

Farrakhan has ca1Ied Judaism a "gut-
ter religion." He told the Oticago Sun-
Times that "Wben I talk to the Jews, I am 
talking to the segment that holds my 
people in its grip." He went on:"1 happen 
to believe that everything I have said 
[abo..'!!,Jews) is the truth." 

His Nation of Islam sells the infa-

Given the years of oppression of blaclcs in South Africa, 
perhaps such anger and hatred is understandable. But

COMMENTARY: The American obsession with thinness is not only unreasonable, but dangerous 

THE HIGH COSTS OF 'BEAUTY' 
By Heether Huo ........ 
Contrlbutlrw Opinion WrIter 

Here's the scenario. You and a 
bunch of friends go out for dinner. 
When it comes time to order, all of the 
males order mega-meals that could 
feed Somalia for three days while all 
of the females order salads with low-
fat dressing. When the food arrives,. 
the guys immediately dig in and don't 
look up until the plate is clean. The 
females, on the other ~ nibble 
daintily. Some finish their salads and 
hungrily eye the men's food while 
feigning that they "couldn't possibly 
eat another bite." The others push 
around their salad hoping that no one 
notices thatthey 've only had two bites. 

A familiar scene for you? It cer-
tainly is for me. Every night at Ocean 
View Terrace, I encounter this di-
chotomy in the eating habits of males 
and females. It's very subtle - you 
may not even notice it unless you look 
-and that's what makes it so danger-
ous. 

America ha a problem that it isn't 
talking about. It's called obsession 
with thinness. 10 a 1985 survey of 
American women, 90 percent of re-
spondeotssaidthey weighed too mucb. 
Whilethisobsessionprimarilyamids 
women, its repen::ussions affect every 
one of us. 

Without knowing it, society is pay-
ing a huge price for its obsession with 
thiness.1o her book 1M BetJIIIy Myth, 
Naomi Wolf desaibes its effects: 
lbere is a disease spreading. It taps 
on the shoulder of America's first-
born .... its best and brightest. At its 

touch, they tumaway from food. Their 
bones swell out from the receding 
flesh. Shadows invade their faces. ... 
They grow thin and still more thin. 
They can hardly speak aloud. They 
lose their libido, and can no longer 
make the effort tojoke or argue. When 
they run or swim, they look appalling; 
buttocks collapsed, tailbones protrud-
ing. ... There is no medical reason .... 
They wallt slowly, with the effort of 
old men. A whitespitt1efonmon their 
lips. They can swallow only pellets of 
bread, and a little thin milk. First tens, 
then hundreds, then thousands, are 
stricken. Many are hospitalized, many 
die." 

What Wolf is describing is an eat-
ing disorder, which strikes one out of 
len young American women. Most 
women with eating disorders suffer 
from anorexia-nervosa or bulernia. 
An anorexic does not eat, sometimes 
for days. A bulemic "binges and 
purges" - overeats and then throws 
up the food. Many people with eating 
disorders have a combination of these 
problems. 

The term "eating disorder" is a 
medical one, and many sufferers are 
cordoned off in society because they 
are somehow seen as "wierdos." As 
one recovering bulemic put it, 
'" Anorexia and bulemia are 
pathologized. As in, when you throw 
up this many times a day you are at 
this level in the disorder. However, 
that is not what the disorder is about. " 

Women don't get eating disor-
ders, they develop them. because of 
societal pressures. Currently, there is

a debate raging as to whether some 
people have a propensity for eating 
disorders. However, the disease itself 
is part of a larger issue - America's 
obsession with thinness. 

From the day women are born they 
are told that thin is beautiful. Women 
are valued simply because of lhe way 
they look. Even if a woman has a 
wonderful personality, if she is 70 
pounds overweight she will have 
trouble finding a partner. Even if a 
woman has excellent qualifications, 
she won't be hired for a job if she is 
"fat." Because of this, most women 
feel tremendous pressure to be thin 
and adhere to the "norm" of society. 

Women are taught that, in order to 
to be sua:essful and have power over 
their own lives, they must "control" 
their weight. One UCSD junior, who 
wishes to remain anonymous, said, "I 
developed bulemia in junior high, at a 
time when I had a lot of problems in 
my life. When I didn't have control 
over my own life, having an eating 
disorder gave me that control. I threw 
up my breakfast as a way of having 
control over myself and my own ac-
tions." 

This pressure to be thin fo)lows 
women everywhere. On TV, only the 
thin women are happy. In advertise-
ments, only thin women are models or 
the successful people in our society. 
We see that Oprah Winfrey, even 
though she had already attained much 
sua:ess in her life, fe It she needed to 
be thin to be happy. We see how 
Roseanne Barr and Delta Burke, two 
outstanding actresses and comedians, 

are publicly ridiculed for their size. 
On the other hand, there 's Norm 

from the television show "OJeers." 
His tremendous girth is encouraged 
both on and off the set. Don't get me 
wrong - men, too, have socielal pres-
sures to look a certain way. However, 
it does nol affect their very liveli-
hoods. For women, it has been driven 
home thaI if they aren'l Ihin, lhey 
aren't anything. It's a pressure that 
follows them everywhere - from the 
time lhey wake up to the time they go 
to sleep, every day of lheir lives. 

The need that women feel to be 
thin isn'l a natural one. As we all 
know, people come in all shapes and 
sizes - short and tall, big and small. 
To be thin, mOSI women muSI physi-
cally change their bodies to fit the 
standard. Women react to this pres-
sure ina numberofways. Some watch 
what they eat, others starve them-
selves. 

Many may say, "We hear that there 
is this pressure to be thin, but the fact 
ofthe matter is that thin is beautiful." 
Yes, being fit and healthy is very 
important and helps some look beau-
tiful, but that's very different then 
being thin. How much are you willing 
to pay for it? With the lives of 150,CXX> 
bulemic and anorexic women a year? 
That's how many women die every 
year because they aren't "thin 
enough." 

Although eating disorders take a 
more severe toll on women's bodies 
and minds than dieting, the two (dis-
orders and dieting) have the same

This, of course, conveniently ignores 
the Jews who died during the civil 
rights struggles of the '60s. If all this 
is true and Farrakhan is unapologetic, 
why is the NAACP inviting him to a 
national summit?

Unfortunattly, I thiak the NAACP is 
respondingtosomethingmuchdeeper, 
stronger, imidiousand, therefore, dan-
gerous. 

According to a recent TUlle/CNN 
poll, African Americans named 
Farrakhan the second most important 
black leader in America today, though 
thankfully with only nine percent to 
Jesse Jackson's 34 percent. However, 
the same poll found that 48 percent of 
African Americans had a "generally 
favorable impression" of Famkhan, 
40 percent personally admired him, 
67 percent found him .an "effective 
leader" and 63 percent agreed with 

UCSD senior Mari Cllemow, a 
recovering anorexic and peer counse-
lor working with others that have eat-
ing disorders, tells a similar story. "I 
was very scared of becoming fat. ... I 
would eat nothing for days .. . and then 
maybe a piece of fruit or a glass of 
milk. But most days I would just eat 
nothing." Chernow eventually spent 
six weeks in the hospital for her disor-
der. At the time, she was 5'1" and 
weighed 70 pounds. "When they first 
put me in and made me eat I was 
pissed... they started me off at 400 
calories a day. That was way too 
much. "To put this number in perspec-
tive, at Treblinka, during the Holo-
caust, Jews were given 900 calories a 
day, the scientifically determined mini-

This cleary indicales that Farrakhan's

people within the African-American 
community. 

Rather than act II a birometer, 
reflexively responding to the latest 
poll daIa, the NAACP should provide 
leadership in the face of this haired. 
Benjamin 0Iavis, the leader of the 
NAACP, shouJd say, "Rev. Farrakban,

Eating disorders are commonly 
thought to be a "white woman's" dis-
ease. However, the pursuitofthinness 
crosses all barriers. All Americans, 
regardless of race, religion or socio-
economic status, are affected by these 
standards in one way or another. For 
some women of color, the dynamics 
oftheobsession with thinness are a bit 
different. For example, in some cul-
tures large women are not only ac-
cepted, but venerated. This directl):. 
contradicts the American notion of 
beauty. Because of this, women of 
cOlor are caught in a double bind. 
Many health clinics do not have coun-
selors adequately trained in dealing 
with the specifics of eating disorders 
- much less counselors trained to put 
eating disorders within the context of 
one's cultural background.

Generation X Author Visits UCSD 
ay ........ NIcoII 
St"ff Writer 

To some, author Douglas 
Coupland is the voice of his gen-
eration, but the author of the 
twentysomething classic, GenerQ-
lion X, may deny it. Nevertheless, 
many of Coupland's fans describe 
bim as a "modem Beatnik." To 
writer and Coupland fan Terry 
Hertzler, Coupland is a modem-
day version of Jack Kerouac or 
Kurt Vonnegut. 

"Every generation goes 
through the same thing - a pe-
riod of trying to figure out why 
things are the way they are," said 
Hertzler, adding that he believes 
Coupland is an author who effec-
tively addresses that question for 
today's younger generation. 

On Tuesday, Coupland ap-
peared at the UCSD bookstore to 
sign copies of his latest offering, 
LifeAfterGod, a collection ofshon 
stories about the big questions in 
life. In idditioD, the author read 
three of his sbon stories to an 
enthusiastic group of approxi-
mately SO students and commu-
nity members. 

Students brought copies of 
Coupland's GeMratiort X, Tile 
Slulmpoo PUJMt and Life After 
God for the author to sign. All 
three boob addresa issues relat-
ing to a younger generation, a rea-
son that some students gave for 
their interest in Coupland's books. 

"He writes how people speak. 
It isn't stiff," said Marshall Col-
lege junior Andrea Aumann, add-
ing; "He's someone youth can 

identify with." 
"It is a biological necessity that 

we have stories told to us," 
Coupland said, before he read some 
of his work to the audience. The 
first piece was I never-before-re-
leased story about a diverse group 
of islanders and their personal 
6att1es. 

Coupland's second story was 
based on the 1974 abduction of 
Patty Hearst, while hls third was 
littered with references to pop cul-
ture figures like Daffy Duct, Bugs 

SUMMER SESSIONS '94 

Bunny aDd Marsha Brady. 
Coupland described his third read-
ing as "for anyone who has ever 
broken up with anyone else. " ' 

Coupland was born on a Cana-
diaD NATO base in Beden-
Solliogen, Germany, but grew up 
in Vancouver, Canada, where he 
now lives. While in art school, he 
often wondered if he was "throw-
ingaway his life," becauie he never 
went to college. However, he said 
he has no regrets about his accom-
plishments.

by the drug being tested on the

the report of the death to the Hu-

that the documentation of informed

there were instances of incomplete

Melissa Ferrick is not just another girl with a guitar 
Singer-guitarist Melissa Ferrick first received ac-

claim after putting on a stirring opening performance 
for Morrissey three years ago. Last year she released 
Massive Blur on Atlantic Records and toured with a 
variety of musicians. inc1uding Paul Westerberg, 
Marc Cohn and the Violent Femmes. Late last year, 
Ferrick released a five-song compact disc featuring a 
song called "Juliana Hatfield," which humorously 
analyzes the way female guitarists are marketed by 
major record labels. Ferrick compares the relatively 
low-key release of her album with the hoopla that 
surrounded Hatfield's release. During a recent phone 

B J J ' E F F. N I ESE L . 

interview, Ferrick talked about Massive Blur and the 
experience of attending school at the Berklee School 
of Music in Boston. She will perfonn at Disc Cafe 
(456-1951) in downtown La Jolla tonight at 8:30 p.m. 
0 ....... : You've opened for â€¢ wide ......

Ferrick: It's the strangest thing. You walk gn stage 
with an acoustic guitar and, being a girl. people 
automatically think you're Tracy Chapman. With the 
Westerberg crowd. I was playing to all these kids

BLUR: Singer cites the 
Bangles as an early influence 
Continued from .... H1 
dressed in black. Then I start playing, and 
they go "Oh my God. She 's not a quiet, little 
singing folk girl." With Marc Cohn, you get 
a yuppie audience, and they think "She's so 
loud." I haven ' t had too much trouble. I also 
change my set list depending on whom I'm 
opening for. I always have a good time 
wondering if they will clap at the end of the 
first song. 
It sounds Ik. you're ......... your 
heart out on .very sonl. Do 1Iv. 
perfonnanc:es become .motlonally 
and physlcdy tolna? 

They do, but I'm still young. I can't sing 
any other way. I live to get onstage. Some-
thing else takes over when I get onstage.It's 
like "here we go. Hold on to your seats. I 
don't know if I'm going to be in tune or not, 
but I certainly am going to be there." I kind 
of surrender all when I sing. I think people 
appreciate it more if you ' re there emotion-
ally inside your songs than how technically 
good you are. 
You went to the Berklee School of 
Music for a couple of y ..... DId you 
learn an)'thlnl that helped your ca-
reer? 

I bought my guitar right before I went 
there. I locked myself in my dorm room and 
wrote songs. I taught myself how to sing and 
play guitar. I didn't really go to class that 
much. The only class I went to was a lyric 
writing class. I had no idea what I would do 
with a degree in songwriting. Berldee is a 
great purgatory. A lot of people go there for 
a little while, and they get out and either get 
something going, or they don't. It's a great 
place because you're surrounded by musi-
cians the whole time. There's some excel-
lent teachers and musicians. But there's also 
2,000 long-haired, electric guitar players 
who buy Steve Vai's book and learn the 
solos. You deal with that and the people who 
want to be the Chili Peppers. It's a weird 
place. 
DId you knOw J ..... HMfteId when 
.... w .. there? 

Yes. We went to school together. She 
was with the Blake Babies. Evan [Dando] of 
the Lemonheads was also in town then. It 
was 1988. It was a weird time. 
Sonp auch .. ......,." Sonc" .... 
"The M ....... of Love" ......... 
......tIc ...... Do you think you 
come across .. a bit ...ave on the 
"'m? 

"Happy Song" was written for the record 
label because they didn't want to sign me 

because my songs were too depressing. I 
didn't have any happy songs. It's a com-
pletely sarcastic song. I don't think I come 
across as naive. I have a difficult time writ-
ing happy things. I think a lot of people do. 
"The Meaning of Love" is about validating 
one-night stands. It's not about really about 
having some long-lasting, committed rela-
tionship. I put this obvious chord change 
underneath it and got a Bangle [Vicki 
Peterson) to sing on it. The Bangles are so 
cool. They are so old now, they're cool. You 
have to love bands like the Go-Go's and 
Bananarama. I get thrown back into my 
sophomore year of high school. 
Sonp auch ...... onest Eyes" ... 
........ Blur" ...... to be -..t 
tryIna to ..... relationships work. 
.... you .xperIenced some tryInl 
relationships? 

Yeah. I think what goes beyond the obvi-
ous fact that I've been through a lot of 
difficult relationships is the fact that I've 
been through a lot of difficult relationships 
quickly. I think the deeper meaning behind 
it, from talking about this record so much, is 
the difficulty I have in the relationship with 
myself and loving myself. Although it sounds 
really' trivial, it's not. That whole puberty 
thing just really screwed up my head. I 
didn't know what was going on. My body 

wu all weirding out, and I had braces and 
glasses. My sister was beautiful and went 
out with the most gorgeous guy. The record 
hu a lot to do with that because now I'm 
growing up and becoming a woman. Being 
23 is a very weird age. You're still young, 
but you're not really a woman. People will 
still call you a girl. Trying to find someone 
to go out with who can deal with my sched-
ule is a whole other thing. 
Wh.t ..... ~ of the title 
""--lre IIIut't 

I know what I was thinking about when I 
wrote that song, but I don't understand ev-
erything about it. I picked Massive Blur as 
the album title because I was really happy 
with the track, and it was the song I was most 
unaware of at the time. The Morrissey tour 
seems like yesterday, and it was three years 
ago. The song clearly states how I feel about 
what has been going on in my life for the past 
three years. It has all been very blurry. It's a 
difficult song. There could be something in 
it from childhood. I always envied others 
who seemed really aware of who they were. 
A lot of people take "Massive Blur" very 
differently. Some women take it as their 
token lesbian thing and that's cool too. I can 
see that in it as well. It will be interesting to 
see how it reveals itself in my life. Ask me in 
three or four years, and we'll see.

HIATUS 4 The UCSD Cuardian Thunday, March 3,1994 

FILM 

The Accompanist 
Claude Miller directs a movingfilm about World War II 

By Yazmln Ghonalm 
Staff Writer 

You can add Parisian director 
Claude Miller's film The Accom-
panist to his list of internationall y-
acclaimed films, which also in-
cludes Garde ti Vue (1981) and 
The LiUle Thief (1988). The Ac-
companist is worthy of praise be-
cause of its realistic portrayal of a 
girl who searches for her identity 
in the midst of World War II. 

Set during the winter of 1942-
43 in German-occupied Paris, the 
film focuses on the hardships en-
dured by the young pianist Sophie 
(Romane Bohringer). 

After the singer Irene (Elena 
Safonova) hires Sophie as her ac-
companist, Soph ie becomes privy 
to Irene's secrets. 

Although her husband Charles 
(Richard Bohringer) is aiding the 
Germans, Irene is having an affair 
with Jacques Fabert (Samuel 
Labarthe), a member of the French 
Resistance. 

When Charles cuts his ties with 

the Germans, he takes Sophie and 
Irene with him to London. There 
they meet Benoit Weizman (Julien 
Rassam), who proposes to marry 
Sophie. Irene doesn' t approve of 
the match, and Sophie is forced to 
live vicariously thro~gh Irene 's 
secret love life. 

Although Miller 's original in-
tent was to divide the film into 
three parts, the first focusing on 
Sophie, the second on Irene and 
the third on Charles, the distinc-
tions are not obvious. 

In the last third, the three char-
acters flee war-torn France, leav-
ing their extravagant life in Paris 
behind . 

Miller sa id in a published inter-
view, "although World War" is 
not ve ry visible in the film , I 
wanted it to be felt, from start to 
fini sh, as an agonizing climate that 
is almost suffQCating." 

With great actingperformances 
and a moving score by Alain Jomy, 
TheAccompanist successfully por-
trays the "agonizing climate" of

CONCERTS 

Aithouah ............ bers of Bitoto come from Z*e, the band now ~ In San UIIIt&Q. 

Bitoto 
Local band heats things up in Friday concert 

By Annett. Loudon 
Guardian Reporter 

Bitoto was steaming when it 
played on the Muir campus last 
Friday night. Don't get me wrong, 
this is not just a cutesy phrase I 
plucked out of my pocket edition, 
"How to write groovy music re-
views." Bitoto 's Zairean vocal trio 
actually worked up such a sweat 
that steam rose from their scalps. 

The Latin rhythms of the Su-
personic School of Samba pre-
pared the crowd for Bitoto' s per-
formance. The audience was in 
the mood to groove, and even a 
few Friday night textbook-
munchers appeared on the balco-
nies of Tioga Hall to shake their 
stuff. 

Bitoto is Zairean for "a stew 
with everything thrown in," and 
the band definitely cooked up a 

delectable blend of African and 
Latin music. These boys were also 
smooth movers. 

Although Bitoto ' s singers, 
MadjoAbdullah, Freddy Basembe 
and Dido Tshibangu have been in 
San Diego for a few years, they 
haven't lost their style. 

When the singers arrived in San 
Diego they were more than sur-
prised to discover an American 
Soukous band ready and waiting 
for their harmonies. 

. After a jam or two, Bitoto was 
born. The final line up includes 
Marcus Turner (congas), J.D. 
Mobely (percussion), Jason Hann 
(drums), David Thompson (bass), 
Leslie Cohen (rhythm guitar) and 
Lew Cohen (guitar). 

This group adroitly plays 
Soukous, Salsa, Rhumba, Merenge 
and probably any other African or 

Cuban style one can think of. These 
musicians twisted the rhythms in 
quite unexpected ways. Details 
aside, it knows how to get things 
shaking. 

Perhaps the most refreshing 
aspect of the performance was the 
blurring of the line between the 
performers and the audience. 
Members of the audience were fre-
quently on stage doing things your 
mother definitely wouldn ' t like. 

And in reciprocal fashion any 
band member who got the urge 
would jump off the stage and wind 
a groove-train through the crowd. 

In case you're begining to feel 
like you missed out big time, you're 
right. Lucky for you, Bitoto plays 
at Cafe Sevilla in downtown San 
Diego every Tuesday from 9 p.m. 
until 1 a.m . For information, call 
John Tidwell at 233-5979.

MU S Ie 

Tori ' Amos 
Under the Pink 

A .......... 

Her debut album was incred-
ible. Tori Amos' Little Earth-
qualces injected 57 minutes of a 
much-needed rush straight to the 
pop jugular. 

While it's often said that the 
'90s is the decade of the female 
artist, few stand outside the blur of 
singers such as Edie Brickel and 
Natalie Merchant - and even 
fewer are the power behind the 
music. Many women in pop con-
tinue to serve as a kind of wallpa-
per: a prelly, decorative backdrop. 

The impact of Little Earth-
qUilUs came from the fact that 
Amos ignored the precendents. 
Instead of mixing up the same pop 
structures, adding some catchy 
hooks and dramatic yet inane lyr-
ics, she built an aesthetic, which 
was miles from the great swells of 
pop-dom. As a classically-trained 
pianisl, this isn'l surprising. 

What makes Amos so engag-
ing is her power. Like Polly Jean 
Harvey, who entered the scene in 
1992 with her brillianlDry, Amos 
placed the conflicts of being a 
woman at the center of her music 
through intense personal narratives 
on love, sexuality, guilt, oppres-
sion and violence. 

However, 
while Harvey is 
driven by dis-
sonance, rage and 
the instabilty of 
gender para-
digms, Amos' 
work 15 melodic, 
and the emotional 
inlensity bubbles 
beneath the sur-
face, only ex-
ploding periodi-
cally. 

Amos' latest 
album,Under the 
Pinle, picks up 
where Little 
Earthquakes left Tort AnIoe' ............. r.I.... .......'t 
off. She has said 1MtdI ........ p Ice of ..... ...... 
Ihat PiIIk is more complex, and 
that it "requires more digging" than 
her debut. Unfortunately, some-
thing was lost in the evolution. . 

While Amos rehashes many of 
the same themes, she's unable to 
reach the high she did in her prev i-
ous work. She misses as often as 
she hits. 

While there are several out-
slanding tracks ("Icicle," 
"Comflake Girl," "The Waitress" 
and "Pretty ' Good Year"), many 

are flat and contrived. 
With Urukr 1M Pink, Amos 

has moved away from her intensely 
personal grounding to a more uni-
versal one, which an damage any 
artist. Perhaps her first album cre-
ated unrealistically high expcc:ta-
tions. While some combination of 
inflated expectations and moraliz-
ing destroyed Tracy Chapman, 
Tori}.mos iso'tdeadyet-I think 
she still has much to offer.

Alice in Chains

Betrayed. Now, with pop-driven rock 
That was the first word thai bands like The Breeders in style, 

crossed my mind when I first heard Alice has taken a decidedly pop 
Alice in Chains' single "No Ex- turn. For this band, however, that 
cuses," off the new Jllr 0/ Flies . turn leads to a dead end. 
EP. A band that could once be 
considered "metal" has devolved 
into the realm of catchy pop jingles. 

Unfortunately, "No Excuses" 
is not very catchy for a pop tune, 
nor is it heavy enough to sustain 
the interest of Alice in Otains fans. 
In fact, the song sounds more like 
a bad cover of an R.E.M. tune. 

And it doesn't get much better 
from there. The album consists 
mainly of semi-acoustic, blues-
influenced tracks reminiscent of 
those released 011 the SlIp SP sev-
eral yean ago. Unlike SlIp, Flies 
does nothing new tDUlicaUy, cov-
ering tired terrilory mercilessly. 

Perhaps lhe key to the new 
album's failure lies in changing 
musical trends. When the band's 
first a1bum,Fllcelift, was released, 
g1am metal was en vogue, and 
some tBcks definitely conveyed a 
g1am feel. 

The next real a1bum,DUt, came 
in lhe midst of the grunge craze, 
and the Seattle-based Alice in 
Chains changed its tune slightly. 

The lyrics have~deadended, 
taking the typical Alice in Chains 
droning "ooh, yeah" vocals to an 
abhorrent excess. 

The meanings are often more 
cryptic than on other Alice albums, 
and they are trite when they do say 
something. 

In the track "Rotten Apple," 
for example, vocalist Layne Staley 
croons, "Hey Ah Na Na, Inno-
cence is over, Over. Hey Ah Na 
Na, Iporance is broken, Broken. " 
Sure, Layne. 

The music is a little bit better, 
although it all too often devolves 
into typical, boring pop or blues. 

. One really neat thing aboUI the 
album is the pactaaing. Little plas-
tic flies slide back and forth be-
neath the left-hand endoftbe cover. 

Don't get me wrong. I still lis-
ten to Jar 0/ Flies, and I stiD tbint 
Alice in Otains is the best thing 
since buttered bread. 

But based on past ~ort, the 
album is a disapppintment.

Ah, spring is here again. 

NCAA OPENER: Third-seed UCSD hosts fourth-ranked Pomona-Pitzer in first round of tourney 
The baseball diamonds are 
green, !be air is fragrant with 
the smell of pine tar and glove 
oil, and all that can be heard is 
the sound of birds singing 
intermingled with the crack of 
a baseball bat making solid 
contact. 

Outfielders have pulled 
their gloves out of the moth-
balls and are shagging flies. 
Pitchers are loosening their 
arms for opening day. Infield-
ers are working the ball around 
the born. Enthusiastic, wide-
eyed rookies, fresh from the 
minors, are looltina to make a 
good impression with the 
parent clubs. Everything is 
right with the world again. 

America!s pastime gives us 
so much to look forward to: 

Frank Thomas ripping a 
three-run homer down the right 
field line; Roger Clemens, 
"The Rodtet," overpowering a 
gawking batter with his 9O-plus

The game has changed 
though. The cJuaic structure of 
baseball, which withstood the 
test of time for so many years, 
is now a memory, replaced by 
the more profitable, multi-
tiered playoff system reminis-
cent of those used by lesser 
sports. 

When I say "lesser," I am 
referring to basketball, football, 
hockey, sports that are 
inherently dwarfed by baseball 
- a gamoowith an unparalleled 
history, a game with distinct 
personalities, a game that has 
endured professionally for over 
a century, virtually unchanged. 

Hey, don't get me wrong; I 
enjoy these lesser sports. I love 
watching Shaq muscle in those 
gorilla dunks just lib everyone 
else, but the MTV "in-your-
face" altitude is mind-numbing 
after a while. And football's no 
beller-the mere presence of 
those crummy, stylin', "pretty-
boy" Cowboys is enough 10

Seldom is a team able to avenge 
every loss it may have suffered over 
the course of a season. The UCSO 
men's basltetball team (20-4) has 

the opportu-
nity to do just 
that in the 
1994 Division 
III National 
Champion-
ships. 

The first 
and second 
rounds of the 
West Region-
als will be 
held tonight 
and Saturday 

in the Triton Main Gym. Both games 
are scheduled for 7:30 p.m. tip-offs, 
and ticket prices are 54 for general 
admission and $3 for students and 
chiidren. 

Thursday's marquee matchup 
pits the West's third-ranked Tritons 
against the visiting Southern Cali-
fornia Intercollegiate Athletic Con-
ference (SClAC) runner-up and 
west Regional fourth-seed Pomona-
Pitzer ,.,,7). 

'I1rp of'tJCSO', four Ioaea, .at 
Cbaplll8D and MeaJo. have been 
successluIly aveopd, but it will be 
payback time with the stakes raised 
for !be San Diego squad, which was 
trounced in its season home-opeoer 
by the Sagehens, 89-68, on Nov. 19. 

The Sagehens dominated virtu-
ally every statillical category. in-
cluding a SI-33 rebound margin. 
Pitzer shot .S IS from the floor to 
UCSO's .338, and the Sagehens hit 
seven of 14 three-pointers while ~ 
Tritons canned a dismal four of 26. 

"We were an entirely different 
offense and an entirely different 
defensive set," Head Coach Tom 
Marshall said. "We decided after 
our first two games to tune the of-
fense down a bit. Pomona-Pitzer is 
going to see a far different team this 
time." 

"The style of play lUils our team 
very well now and we are playing 
some very solid buketblll," he 
added. "We aren't doing anything 
particularly different in preparing 
for them. Pitzer is a good team that 
has gotten the most out of their play-
ers, bllt we just need to tend to 
business and stay focused." 

The winner will host the SCIAC 
champion and the West's top-gun, 
California Lutheran University (24-
2) on Saturday.

The Kingsmen also had their way 
with the Tritons earlier in the sea-
son, giving their southern opponents 
a merry Yuletide crushing, 1()()'79, 
on Dec. 23. 

"Cal Lu is a very good team," 
Marshall said of the November 
game. "There is no doubt about it. 
But I feel that if we get there, we can 
play with them." 

The Tritons home-court advan-
tage should most certainly work in 
their favor. "It's great to be playing 
It home, but it can be difficult," 
Marshall admitted. "We can't allow 
our emotions to get away with us. 
We have to remain focused and 
maintain our inlensity." 

UCSD was pleasantly sUrprised 
when it discovered that it had the 
chance to host. In a controversial 
selection process last Sunday 
evening, third-seed UCSO was 
awarded the host site for the 
tournament's opening rounds de-
spite not being the West's premier 
qualifier. 

Because Cal Lutheran, which 
with a first-place &ceding, should 
have earned the right to host, pllYs 
on a non-NCAA sanctioned, 88-foot 
court, the Kingsmen found them-
selves hilling the highways. 

"I hate playing at their place," 
Marshall said. "But they do,a great 
job of usina the smaller court to 
their advantage." 

Pomona-Pitzer, had they beaten 
Cal Lu in last Saturday's head-to-
head matcbup for !be- SCIAC tide, 
would have staked its NCAA cham-
pionship hopes on home ground. 
But an 89-68 loss dropped Pitzer 
dramatically in the rankings. 

The Sagehens were previously 
tied for first with St. Thomas of 
Minnesota in the West region in the 
NCAA Division III national polls 
released only last week. 

But after a long and arduous con-
ference call which consisted of of-
ten-heated input from head basket-
ball coaches across the nation on 
Sunday, the NCAA selection com-
millee determined that UCSO's im-
pressive tally of victories, which 
included wins over several top Oi-
vision II and NAJA foes in addition 
to an unprecedented victory over 
Division I Northern Arizona Uni-
versity, deserved the nod. 

Tom Marshall attributes the Tri-
tons' fortunate stroke ofluck in host-
ing to simple geography. 

"That's just life out here in the 
West," Marshall said. "National goes

Cycling 

The UCSD cyÂ· 
cling team was off to 
the Claremont Col-
leges in L.A. last 
weekend for its first 

chance of the season to see how it 
measured up against the national 
cycling powerhouse Cal-Poly San 
Luis Obispo. 

Despite a second-place finish 
overall behind Cal-Poly SW, San 
Diego was able to take first place in 
the A division races. 

" It was a really important race 
this weekend. It was good for us to 
get a look at one of the top teams in 
the nation and 
now we know 
that our A team 
can beat them," 
said sophomore 
race r Ian 
Bett inger. " It 
was a real con-
f i de nc e

UCSD squad, out for the season. 
Chad Roemer came in with a 

fifth-place finish, ahead of team-
mate Mark Patterson who cruised 
home for an eighth-place tally in 
the men's Drace. 

The women's A team grabbed 
the third and fourth-place positions 
with strong performances from 
Karina Francis and Rachel Tobin. 

In the women's B division, 
Rachel Kay garnered a strong 
fourth-place finish to hold up the 
UCSD banner. 

Sunday brought a new course to 
challenge the competitors. The 

In men's A, Livingston endured 
the course to place third, just ahead 
of teammate Glenn Sanders, who 
captured fourth place. Bettinger 
came home in seventh position to 
round out the top UCSD finishers. 

The men's B team took four of 
the top-10 finishes, with showings 
by Leute (fourth), Alex Vendler 
(sixth), Erik Stauber (ninth), and 
Tim Knudsen (10th). 

In the C Division, Joe Nelesen 
captured third for UCSD, while 
Mike Seid also grabbed a 10th-place 
finish. 

The men's D race resulted in two 

In Satur-
day's Asphalt

men's A squad 
was led by Dave

was nosed out

in the sprint and 
had to settle for 
a second-place 
finish. 

Photo Counesy of NICk MoecIe/Ryln Cady 
Ian Bettlnle, and Adam Uvlnpton (front two on rICht) paced the UCSO effort. 

Other no-
table finishers for UCSD were 
Adam Livingston (fourth), Dave 
Deyhimy (fifth), and Bettinger 
(ninth). 

In the men's C Division, Jesse 
Rosen brought home the team's top 
finish, taking seventh and followed 
closely by Jed Brintzenhoff in 
eighth and Eric Leute in eleventh.

The UCSD equestrian team 
was burdened with an extreme

but it was certainly not the result 
of any failure on the team's part.

the blue ribbon- first place overÂ·

UCSD trampled an elite field, 
which featured Division I powerÂ·

three finisbes. 

Among the multiple winners, 
Kristen Smith seized first in the 
novice equitation-over-fences

Chung and Katherine Brovant in 
the walkÂ·trot canter and walkÂ·trot

Women's Lacrosse 

The UCSD 
women's lacrosse 
team (2-0 in league) 
has had an outstand-., 
ing year thus far, and 

its success continued last weekend 
when the Tritons travelled to Ari-
zona for a battle against the UniÂ· 
versity of Arizona. 

UCSD entered the game ranked 
second in the South, while the Wild-
cats held the fifth-place ranking 
and posed a stiff test for the young 
Tritons. 

Forced to compete without the 
guidance of Head Coach Diane 
Whipple, who was unable to join 
ber team in Arizona, UCSD had to 
look within itself for motivation 
and8dvi~. 

"1tw.loughwitbout(Whipple]

Obviously, UCSD made the

team captain Lac Ngyen said. 

But this is nothing new for the 
Tritons. "As a unit, we've been 
playing extremely well defen-
sively," Whipple said.

trolled the momentum of the game, 
placing continual pressure on the 
Wildcats. 

led by Jeannie Churo, who put 
home five goals in the contest, and 
Nguyen, who tallied three, the Tri-
tons had no trouble putting balls 
past the Arizona defense. 

1be victory pulled UCSD into a 
firstÂ·place tie in tbe Southern DiviÂ· 
sion with the Uaiversity of Calif or-
nia at Santa Barbara, with whom 
the Tritons will do battle on Sun-
day, April 10.

Rugby 

The UCSD 
rugby team's 
hopes of qualify-
ing for the play. 
offs this season 

were dealt a harsh blow last Satur-
day when the promising young 
squad suffered a resounding 32-6 
defeat at the hands of conferenco 
power Loyola Marymounl. 

UCSD exerted a solid allÂ·around 
effort but 
could not deÂ· 
cipher the 
more experi-
enced lMU 
team. UCSD 
fell to 2-2 in 
league play. 

is currently ranked second. 
UCSD, still banged up from an 

OMBAC Tournament a couple of 
weeks ago, had trouble generating 
any kind of offensive momentum 
against the host Lions. 

UCSD's lone scoring efforts 
were two first-half penalty kicks 
converted by captain Devon Shea. 

The stingy lMU defense be-
fuddled any other San Diego at-

tempts to close 
the ever-wid-
ening scoring 
gap. 

Despite the 
final tally , 
Stensen and 
fellow coach 
Erik Takeuchi 
were generally 
pleased with 
the perfor-
mance turned 
in by their San 
Diego squad 
against the 
more experi-
enced lions. 

"We ' re 
still in the 
running [for a 
playoffspotJ, 
but we will 
probably 
have to finish 
the season 
with a record 
of 5-2," 
Coach Mark 
Stensen said.

rently, the San Diego squad sits 
tied for third in the Southern Cali-

LMU kept its top-seed spot with 
the victory Saturday, and UC Irvine 

Men's Lacrosse 

., 
UCSD doesn't 

usually play a team 
like UCLA in any 
sport. Basketball? 
No. Baseball? Think 

again. Men's lacrosse? Why not. 
Although UCLA is a Division I 

power in just about everything 
imaginable, lacrosse is not exactly 
its forte. 

Host UCSD took full advantage 
orUCLA's.inadequacies last SatÂ· 

checked in 
with a strong outing for UCSD. 

The UCSD B side outplayed 
LMU's second unit, with consisÂ· 
tent play from Andy Lin and Erik 
Schultz en route to a 20-15 victory.

urday, thoroughly dominating ilS 
foe, 18-8, to raise ilS Western ColÂ· 
legiate Lacrosse Association SouthÂ· 
em Division record to 3-0. 

"Defensively, I don't think we 
played very well," captain Mark 
Steele said. 

"All of [UCLA's] goals were 
pretty weak. There's no way we 
should have allowed eight goals. 
The goals that UCLA scored were 
just ridiculous," he added. 

San Diego was 
constantly in control 
from the game's 
outset. Using a solid 
passing game, 
UCSD established 
an 8Â·3 advantage at . 
halftime. 

Attackman 
James Kappler led 
the way for UCSD, 
scoring four goals. 
MidfielderThadeus 
Reynolds tallied 
three scores.

M. HOOP: 
UCSD hosts NCAAs 
Continued from peee 11 
with whatever makes the most sense 
financially for the matchups. The 
number-two seed St. Thomas [MNJ 
is hosting number-five Central 
[lowaJ. Normally four and five 
would be fighting it out to take on 
the number-one team. But that would 
cost a lot more in travel costs over 
the week. 

"We are very excited to host," he 
added. "It doesn't always work out 
th.t way in the West, but we are 
going to use this to our advantage. 
We feel we have a debt to repay to 
Pomona-Pitzer. "

The UCSD Guardian Thunday, March 8, 1994 

GuarJinn Wilts, Whines 
HUMIUAnON: Sniveling sports editor costs UCSD a sure victory against Aztec 
By Philip MIc ...... 
Senior Staff Writer 

In a game that grew to be as ugly 
as Roseanne Arnold after she got 
her fifth tattoo, the UCSD Guardian 
lost a hard-fought basketball con-
test totheSDSU DailyAzlec, 50-48, 
on Saturday. 

The Guardian, ahead at halftime 
and up by as many as eight points 
during the contest, managed to pull 
defeat from the jaws of victory while 
soiling the honor of UCSD. 

Guardian players were quick to 
assess blame for the victory. 

"It was Hutto's fault," said As-
sociate Spons Editor Aron Miller. 

"Yup. Hutto," said Staff Writer 
Jeff Praught. 

Sports Editor Brian Hutto, the 
Guardian's leading scorer with IS 
points, earned the scorn of his team-
mates when his fiery temper flared 
late in the game. 

"I blame myself," Hutto said. 
"Damn right you should," 

.seethed News Editor Philip 
Michaels. 

"You jackass," Michaels added. 
Late in the game, the Guardian 

clawed its way toa44-40 lead, based 
in part on the brilliant coaching of 
the plucky news editor. Michaels, 
who is as renowned for his hoops 
savy as he is for his journalistic 
skill, was guiding the Guardian with 
his brilliant play-calling when the 
hotheaded Hutto hollered at his 
coach. 

As Michaels sulked on the side-
line, the dispirited Guardian squad 
limped through the rest of the game. 
The Aztec tied the score at 45 and 
raced ahead to victory. 

"That was a dumb thing for Brian 
to do," Miller said. "Michaels is a 
Lutheran, and everybody knows that 
Lutherans are really good at basket-

Brtan K. Hutto drIv .. to the hoop before ac/Urnlng like a benlhee. 
baiL" 

Hiatus Editor Jeff Niesel, the 
Guardian big man who contributed 
one point, was irate about the 
Guardian'S defeat. 

"Hutto shouldn't be allowed to 
be a bench-warmer in a pee-wee 
league," Niesel sniffed. 

Although Hullo' s play was remi-
niscent of an enraged yak, the hot-
tempered sports editorwas not com-

pletely to blame for the Guardian's 
defeat. The Aztec players cried like 
schoolgirls whenever a Guardian 
defender brushed up against one of 
them. 

"Ow,"saidanAztecplayer. "The 
wind ruffled my bair. Foul!" 

As the Guardian players limped 
back into the locker room, they took 
solace in the fact that at least they 
didn't go to a community college. 

Lawson, Nishiyruna Lead Tritons 
selFCCs: UCSD makes a name for itself at fencing conference championships 
By Dan Kreft 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD fencing team put it-
self on the map last weekend at the 
Southern California Intercollegiate 

Fencing Con-
ference Cham-
pionships. 

The Triton 
women's squad 
finished second 
.overall in the 
conference be-
hind Cal State 
University Ful-
lertonand ahead 
of such teams as 
UCLA, the Uni-
versity of 
Soutbern Cali-

fornia and UC Santa Barbara. 
UCSD was led by Yumi 

Nishiyama, who captured the sea-
son conference championship after

bellied, uncouth Pbillies any day 
of the week. Where else in pro 
sports can fans witness an athlete 
with the unique physique and 
persona of a John Kruk? 

What I fear most is that the bile-
ball playoff system will resemble 
too closely those of hockey, football 

an outstanding year-long perfor-
mance. Nishiyama completed the 
season with a conference record of 
33-3. 

The Triton men's foil team fin-
ished fourth in the conference and 
was led by the strong performance 
of Gabe Lawson, who captured an-
other conference championship for 
UCSD. 

Lawson ended his star-studded 
year with a near perfect 32-2 confer-
ence mark. 

The men's sabre team finished in 
. third place, paced by the eighth-
place finisb of Rich Liu. 

Mcn's6pe6broughthomeafifth-
place tally in the seven-team con-
ference. 

According to UCSD Head Coach 
Lisa Posthumus, the 6pe6's finish 
was quite respectable for the younS 
and inexperienced squad, which 
should improve in years to come. 

and basketball. These systems take 
away the importance of the regular 
season because so many teams make 
it to post-season play. 

The beauty of the old system was 
that every season game really mat-
tered. There were no pansy wild-
card teams to stink up the playoffs. 
It was all or nothing. At the rete 
things are going, the Meta, the Dal-
las Maveric:bofbueball, could very 
soon be in the playoffs. 

Despite the changes, some things 

Justine Cogan (women's foil) and 
Tom Powell (men's foil) also cap-
tured top-eight finishes for the Tri-
tons to round out the strong overall 
performance. 

"I was very pleased with our per-
formance this weekend," Head 
Coach Lisa Posthumus said. "We've 
been improving steadily all season 
long." 

UCSD will head to the Univer-
sity of Southern California on March 
5-6 for tbe Western Regional com-
petition in which NCAA benhs will 
be up for grabs. 

For all those interested in fenc-
ing, spring tryouts will be held soon, 
and spots will be open in all disci-
plines. 

Tbe NCAA recently added 
women's 6pe6 to the sport, so 
Posthumus will be looking for some 
tall, strong women 10 compete in 
this new area. 

will remain constant. Barry Bonds 
will win another MVP, Maddux will 
win 20, and Mc:Gwire will hil 40 
homers. At least the game's players 
will remain the same. 

Around the comer lies the '94

UCSD at Mercy of Schedule 
TOUGH ROAD: After shutting out Redlands, Tritons fall to Western Michigan, 9-0 
ByD ... Sw ..... ' 
StsffWrlter 

In keeping with the roller-
coaster-like character of its season, 
the UCSD women's tennis team lost 

to Division I 
adversary 
Western 
Michigan 
University, 
9-0, at the 
Muir courts 
on Monday. 

The de-
feat seemed 
especially 
surprising 
considering 
that the Tri-
tons had just 

come off of a 9-0 victory against 
Redlands. But the inconsistent out-
ings throughout the season can be 
attributed to a fickle schedule more 
than anything else. 

"Our competition has been such 
extremes, really weak teams and 
really strong teams," UCSD Head 
Coach Liz LaPlante said. "[The loss] 
made us realize what we need to 
work on and gets us ready for our 
next matcbes." 

Despite getting shut out, the Tri-
tons performed well, considering 
the caliber of their opponents. 

Playing admirably at the num-
ber-one spot, Diane Cllandler fought 

hard in her 6-4, 6-1 loss to Holly 
Taylor, to make the final score re-
spectable. 

The same can be said of number-
~o player Michele Malephansukal. 
The freshman lost to Andrea En-
gland (6-2, 6-1) but is still adjusting 
to the number-two spot. 

Perhaps the greatest singles ef-
fort of the day came from number-
three Hilary Somers. Only a sopho-
more, she battled Heidi Cakans to 
the limit, eventually falling 6-4, 6-
2, in a well-played matcb. 

"[Somers) bad a good match," 
laPlante said. "Sbe's been winning 
so easily in all of ber matches, and 
she's not used to losing many games. 
[The loss) made her aware that she's 
been hitting the ball too short and 
needs to hit the ball deeper against 
the really strong girls." 

laPlante also praised number-
four player Heather Williams. 

"Even though [Williams) lost 6-
0,6-0, she actually had a pretty good 
match. There were a lot of deuce 
games and really good points, and 
sbe put the ball away. It didn't look 
like a 6-0, 6-0 match. " 

To round out the singles scoring, 
number-five Miki Kurokawa fell 6-
1, 6-0, and number-six Anne 
Hoecker was defeated 6-2, 6-0. 

UCSD was also extremely com-
petitive in doubles, tenaciously con-
testing every point. 

The number-three duo of 
Hoecker and OIandler refused to 
fold against England-Stanislaw. 
After losing in the first set, 6-3, they 
continued to fight in the second, 
forcing it down to the wire, but 
finally surrendering, 6-4. 

"Number-three almost split sets 
and played well," LaPlante said. 

At the tough number-one spot, 
Kurokawa and Williams found 
themselves overwhelmed by Tay-
lor-Cakans, losing 6-2, 6-1. Mean-
while, tbe number-two combo of 
Somers-Malephansakullost 6-2, 6-
O. 

laPlante admitted that playing 
the inconsistent opponents makes it 
difficult to gauge how mucb the 
team is improving. The remainder 
of the schedule seems much more 
appropriate for the team's ability.

Tritons Still Winless 
Mter Losing Twin Bill 
DOUBLE TROUBLE: UCSD loses pair to Cal Baptist 
By AlOft Mille, 
Associate Sports Editor 

As the t 994 season progresses, 
things aren't getting any better for 
the UCSD softball team. Continu-

ing their los-
ing ways, the 
Tritons (0-4), 
coughed up a 
double-header 
toNAlApow-
erhouse Cali-
fornia Baptist 
College, 6-5 
and 6-0, on 
Tuesday. 

UCSD 
hung tough in 

the first game, matching the lanc-
ers run for run until late in the con-
test. 

Freshman Michelle Courtright 
provided some instant power at the 
plate, launching a homerun in her 
first at-bat in the bottom of the first 
inning. The blast gave the Tritons 

an early 1-0 lead . 
UCSD put up single runs in the 

second and third innings, while Cal 
Baptist (10-1-1) plated three run-
ners in the third, tying the score at 
three. 

The Lancers scored the go-ahead 
run in the sixth inning and UCSD 
failed to answer in the seventh. 

Pam Seco (5-1) collected the 
complete game win for the Lancers, 
while freshman Shannon Mounger 
went the distance but record\:d the 
loss for UCSD. 

The second game of the twin bill 
was all Cal Baptist. 

Shannon Colismo(5-O-1)pitched 
a masterful game, no-hitting the 
Tritons for the initial four innings. 

UCSD's best chance to score 
came in the sixth inning, when it 
garnered three hits, but it could not 
bring anybody home. 

Junior Lisa Gill pitched a com-
plete game for the Tritons, but suf-
fered the loss. 

UCSD Remains Unheaten 
ONE STROKE: Tritons tally fourth win, barely get-
ting by the University of Redlands and Point Lorna 
Associate Sports Editor 

Coming off one of its best out-
ingsofthe young season, the UCSD 
golf team barel y squeaked by with a 

Country Club. 

sub-par perfor-
mance against the 
University of 
Redlands Bull-
dogs and the 
Point Lorna 
Nazarene Col-
lege Crusaders on 
Monday, 
outshooting its 
foes by a mere 
one stroke over-
all at Redlands 

medalist honors with Ryan Carr's 
one-under-par 70. 

Freshman Mike Hartford once 
again paced the Triton effort, firing 
a one-over-par 72. Although he is 
still not teeing off in the number-
one position, Hanford has carried 
the load all season long for UCSD 
(4-0). 

"We're kind of keeping him in 
the background, " Wydra said. "He's 
taking the place of an All-American 
(Jeremy Moe) and he'sdoingagreat 
job. It's quite a credit to him. He's 
the best freshman I've ever had." 

Senior Dale Abraham placed sec-
ond on the Triton squad, finishing 
with a 76. Juniors Brock Shafer and 
Tom Brown closely followed, shoot-
ing a 78 and 80, respectively. 
Redshirt freshman Hunt Cairns 
chipped in with an 81 and sopho-

-

"It was kind of an off-showing 
for us, especially after shooting a 
293 [against Cal State Dominguez 
Hills on Friday)," UCSD Head 
Coach Mike Wydra said. "The 
course was a little trickier, but not 
too much." 

more Steve Lynn rounded out the ...., 
scoring with an 83. 

The final scorecard showed 
UCSD with an uncharacteristic306, 
Point Lorna with a 307 and Redlands 
with a 319. 

Although the Crusaders failed to 
get the win, they did capture the
