SANTA BARBARA - Rules 
of confidentiality continue to 
shroud the details of former U CS B 
Chancellor Robert H uttenback 's 
disciplinary case before the Aca-
demic Senate. 

Following H uttenback's sen-
tencing, Chancellor Barbara 
Uehling placed H uttenback on an 
interim suspension from his posi-
tion as a tenured history professor.

In an effort to reduce car theft, 
UCSO's Community Service

Awarded Grant 
for Research 

The UC D School of Medi-

ogy has been awarded $40,000 
from Research to Prevent Blind-
ness (RPB) to support advanced 
research int o the cau es, treat-
ment and prevention of blinding 
diseases. 

The un rc~t ricted grant was 
accepted by Dr. Stuart I. Brown, 
chairman of the department. 

"It is tru l an honor to receive 
this award since R PB is this coun-

reporting suspicious activities to 
the police. 

According to CSO Jay Bob-
rowsky, officers are "looking for 
people who don't fit in .... 

AI Jenkins, UCSO's crime 
prevention officer, added that 
people seen looking into cars or 
roaming the lots in groups are 
also considered suspicious. 

The purpose of the program, 
according to Bobrowsky, is to 
deter thieves before they can do 
anything, rather than stop them 
in the process of breaking into a 
car. 

The program is scheduled to 
last through the winter quarter, at 
the end of which it effectivene s 
will be evaluated. 

"(We] wanted todosomething,'" 
Jenkins explained, while pointing 
out that "The best deterrent is still 
up to the owner. to 

Jenkins commented that it has 
not been determined yet whether 
the program is effective, or if it is 
only causing thieves to go else-
where on campus. 

The program will continue after 
winter q4arter if it is found to be 
successful and if funding for the 
program is available, Jenkins said . 

"Whether we can afford to con-
tinue ... remains to be een," Jen-
kin said. He went on to ay that ,

too mall to pay alarie for park-

Following the suspension, the 
case became the Academic 
Senate's responsiblity. Until that 
body forwards its decision to the 
chancellor for her approval, she 
will not know the progress of the 
decision, Uehlin~ said this month. 

According to a Sept. 16 Daily 
Nexus article, the senate convened 
a committee to investigate whether 
there was enough evidence to 
bring Huttenback before its Privi-

Scripps Clinic to Get Cray Computer 
By REBEKAH YOUNG 
Contributing Writer 

In a move that will greatly advance its research 
capabilities, Scripps Clinic and Re earch Foun-
dation has ordered a $5 million supercomputer to 
replace their existing system. 

The computer, to be used for research in the 
field of biotechnology, will be installed in late 
March . Cray Research, which built the small unit 
now in use , will al 0 build the new upercomputer. 

The current sy tern is used for biological 
research and ba ic research application and 
allow expert in fields such a X-ray crystallo-
graphy, nucler magnetic resonance, molecular 
modeling and computer graphics to more quickly 
design pharmaceutical drug. 

The computer i al 0 used to decipher the 
shape and dynamic of peptides, protein, 
antibodies, viruse ,and other biological materials. 

One program "investigates the behavior of 
large protein molecule , how they operate and 
how they relate with each other," Phil Cohen, 
director of re earch computing at the re earch 
institute of Scripp Clinic, aid. _ 

The new supercomputer system will be used in 
primarily the same ways a the current system, 
but will be a "larger, more powerful" machine, 
according to Cohen. 

The new computer's increa ed memory, dou-
ble that of the UCSO upercomputer, represent 
a ignificant improvement from cripp' existing 
system, according to Cohen. 

"The principle difference [between the old and 
new systems] is that the new supercomputer will 
have four times more memory, to Cohen said. 

The additional memory is needed to "look at 
larger molecules," the re earch director added . 

The upercomputer will also be able to per-
form calculations at a faster rate.

Must Pay 
Embezzlement 
Fines in Full 

By ADAM MOSS 
Slaff Writer. Daily Nexus 

SANTA MARIA - Respond-
ing to a routine court hearing last 
month where it was revealed that 
former UCSB Chancellor Robert 
Huttenback was paying $60,000 
in court fines in $200 monthly 
installments, Santa Maria Super-
ior Court Judge Zel Canter ruled 
that the fines instead be paid in 
full within the next 30 days. 

H uttenback, who was convicted 
of embezzlement and tax evasion 
last September, said last month 
that he had planned to increase 
his monthly payments to $1,000 
beginning in January. 

At the. Dec. 12 hearing, how-
ever, Canter said that he had 
expected Huttenback and his wife 
Freda, who had been fined $10,000, 
to pay the fines in a lump sum 
immediately following their con-
viction, rather than paying in 
installments. 

Santa Monica attorney Dennis 
Fisher, who is acting as the Hut-
tenbacks' legal counsel in the 
appeal of their conviction, was 
asked to present a new schedule 
of payment at Monday's hearing. 

Fisher suggested Monday that 
the payment of the fines should be 
delayed until the conclusion of 
the Huttenbacks' appeal, which 
is ex~cted to be heard by the 
State Court of Appeals in one to 
two years. 

'1The Huttenbacks] were hop-
ing that no payment would have 
to be paid at this time," Fisher 
said. 

But Canter aid the Hutten-
backs must pay their fine within 
a month. In a partial conce ion 
to Fisher' request , Canter tipu-
lated that the money be placed in 
a county intere t-earning e crow 
account, which will be repaid to 
the Huttenback if their appeal is 
uccessful. 

"After the appeal i decided, 
the prevailing party will take the 
money," Canter aid . 

anta Barbara A sistant Dis-
trict Attorney Pat McKinley, who 
represented the county at the 
hearing, aid the e crow account 
was unneces ary, becau e the 
county can afford to pay back the 
$70,000 in fine if the Hutten-
backs win their appeal. 

McKinley aid the hearing was 
routine in nature becau e mo t 
defendants are required to pay 
court fines immediately if they 
are deemed capable of paying.

within a few day,," McKinJey

VCR Psychology Professor Resigns 
From Department in Protest of Policy 

RIV ERSIDE - UC R Psychology profe sor 
Spencer Kagan resigned Dec. 22. 

In an open letter dated Jan. 6 to Cha ncellor 
Rosemary . J. Schraer and facu lty member of the 
psychology department and the Scheol of Education, 
Kagan cited the reasons for his resignation. In the six-
page letter, Kagan alleges that he was not allowed to 
teach a course in his field of interest, and that he was 
a signed by the department chair a cour e in introduc-
tory psychology without any co nsultation. He also 
claimed that the University i too concerned about 
research and did not appreciate his work in educa-
tional course development . 

Lew Petrinovich, chair of the psychology depart-
ment, asserted that research is the UC' main priority. 
" He [Kagan) was a lost entity as far as our program, 
and the University of California is a research univer-
sity," Petrinovich said. " I mean we're supposed to be; 
that's part of our responsibility, anyway." 

Irving Hendrick, dean of the School of Education, 
described Kagan as a prominent figure in the coopera-
tive learning movement. Hendrick said Kagan's work 
would be described as "practical applied program 
developments" as opposed to research activi ties. 

"The bottom line is that Spencer Kagan would have 
likely had an easier time and had a more hospitable 
relationship in an education school than he would 
have in a psychology department in a college of let-
ters, arts and sciences," he said .

Univ. Center 
to Open 
April 17 

By ERIC CHAZANKIN 
Associate News Editor 

Work on UCSD's new Uni-
versity Center is nearing com-
pletion with the grand opening 
currently set for the week of 
April 17. 

So me parts of the center may 
be open even earlier. The 
theater, in particular, is sche· 
duled to be open by the begin-
ning of spring quarter, April 3. 

"There will be classes sche-
duled in [the theater) from 8:30 
a .m. to 2 p.m.," said A.S. Uni-
versity Center Board Commis-
sioner Evan Weisenfeld. ~You'l 
see it listed in the sched ule of 
classes" as a new class location, 
he added. 

Weisenfeld is confident that 
the center will open on ~che­
dule, despite the delays which 
have marked the construction 
of the center over the past year. 

"We're hoping that , by April 
17, the majority of [the center) 
will be open," he said . 

"The one thing that's really 
holding us up is the carpeting," 
Weisenfeld added, explaining 
that a special type of carpeting 
is being used. However, "The 
theate.r may begin [being used) 
without it." 

"In about a week and a half,

planting," he said . "I'm very 
happy with how it's looking." 

Even after the April 17 open-
ing date, however, some major 
parts of the center will not yet 
be open. The University Book-
store, for example, will not open 
in its new location until "the 
middle of May." 

He stated that the process of 
moving into the new center for 
occupants such as the A.S. will 
begin over spring break. 

"We [the A.S.) have already 
. been receiving all the furniture." 

Weisenfeld , who has been 
working with the University 
Center project from its early 
planning stages, says that he 
has heard both good and bad 
things about it from students. 

The delays in the opening of 
the center have been the main 
source of negative comments, 
Weisenfeld explained. He stated 
that people have been asking 
him fairly often " 'Is it really 
going to open before I gradu-
ate?' ..

Medical Facility Named 
By RANDY DOTINGA 
Staff Writer 

The planned UCSD Satellite 
Medical Facility's Ambulatory 
Care Center will be named after 
La Jolla residents Edith and Wil-
liam M. Perlman, the University 
announced last week. 

The Perl mans "have been two 
of UCSD's strongest supporters," 
said UCSD Chancellor Richard 
C. Atkinson of the couple that 
gave $1 million to support the 
facility. 

The facility is scheduled to open 
in early 1991 , and ground break-
ing will begin in 1990. It will be 
located on a 4O-acre site east of 
Interstate 5, across from the 
UCSD School of Medicine. 

The facility, a satellite of the 
UCSD Medical Center in Hill-
crest, will consist of a hospital and 
the Ambulatory Care Center. The 
hospital's 120 beds will be trans-
ferred from the 447 licensed beds 
at the Medical CenteL 

According to Michael R. 
Stringer, associate vice chancellor 
for health sciences and director of 
hospitals and clinics at UCSD, 
~This transfer will help solve the 
space problems at the Medical 
Center by decompressi ng the 
severely overcrowded facility_ .. 
We now look forward to provid-
ing more adequately siz.ed rooms 
and amenities." 

The Ambulatory Care Center 
will be staffed by doctors from a 
wide variety of specialties who 
will treat people on a outpatient 
basis. 

According to Gerard N. Bur-

row, vice chancellor for health 
sciences at UCSDanddeanofthe 
Medical School, "The proximity 
of a hospital [to the campus) will 
create a stimulating environment 
for medical progress." 

The total cost of the facility is 
estimated to be over 574 million. 
According to Associate Dean of 
the School oi Medicine Ruth 
Covell, financing for the project 
will come mainly in the form of a 
loan, but "there may be some 
other small bits of financing. n She 
also said that no University or 
state funds would be used. 

New Gallstone 
Procedure at 
Med Center 

The UCSD Medical Center will 
soon be using a new procedure to 
shatter gallstones with high-fre-
quency shockwaves. 

The procedure, called extra-
corporeal shock wave therapy, 
will start to be used in April , on a 
trial basis. 

This new gallstone treatment 
will be made possible by the aqui-
sition by the Medical Center of a 
Dornier multipurpose Iithotripter. 

This device will be used to per-
form gallstone lithotripsy, in 
which ultrasound is used to locate 
the gallstones, which are then des-
troyed by powerful shock waves. 

The lithotripter, made in West 
Germany, will be the first device 
of its kind operating in San Diego. 
Its cost is about $1.1 million.

Parking Aggravating 
The parking problem keep getting worse . The city of an 

Diego is planning to install a b ike path on To rrey Pines Road , 
between Ardath and La Jolla Village Drive . s a result. there 
will be no parking on that st retch of road . 

The bike path is certainly a good idea from the sta ndpoint of 
afety, since a lot of bikes use that road . However. it only points 

out again that the niversit y is moving slowly on a problem 
which i getting worse a more students come to UCSD, more 
buildings are built on parking lots, and parking near campus 
disappears. 

The U niversi ty needs a coherent attack on the parking prob-
lem, using a va riet y of approaches. For example, reserved park-
ing for one person is an extremely inefficient use of space. It is 
only utilized for a few hours each day, and sits empty - aggra-
vating students cruising for a space - the rest of the day. 

Solutions are hard to come by. Parking structures help in the 
long run , but have the immediate effect of closing off parking 
(and walkways) in the area of their construction. Constructing 
distant parking and running trams in also inconvenient, but then 
so is drivi ng through a full parking lot for half an hour. 

A variety of solutions do exist, and the administration should 
look for them. They should encourage student comment , with, 
for example, publicized open meetings . Parking may not be high 
on t he li st of priorit ies for the administrators (many of whom 
park in those reserved spaces), but searching for parking place 
and hiking to class occupy large part of many students days. 

The administration needs to allocate more resources to this 
problem . Until they do , it might be a good idea to ride yo ur bike 
to school.

La Jolla a College Town? 
By LEESA LIGHT 
Production Manager 

La Jolla , California . People 
don't think of UCS D the minute 
they think of La Jolla. They 
think of rich people, movie stars 
and expensive stores. They think 
of glamour. The furthest thing 
from their minds is a college 
town. That is the furthest thing 
from my mind and most stu-
dents' minds when they begin to 
search for schools. 

I grew up in San Diego and 
had not even heard of UCSD 
until my junior year in high 
school. My mom decided that it 
was time for me to start check-
ing out colleges in the area, so I 
went in to see my high school 
counselor. 

I told her that I wanted to 
check out UC La Jolla. She told 
me there was no such thing. 

"You mean UC San Diego," 
she said . 

I said , " 0, UC La Jolla ."She 
st raightened me out on that 
point. 

I thought that 1 would come 
to VIsit. The ,chool eemed reall> 
neat. all of those bIg buildlOg~ 

were really cool. I visited the 
Med School (I had grand dreams 
of being a great genetic engineer 
when I graduated). I knew that 
there was something missing, 
but I didn't know what it was. 

I figured it out. This is not a 
college campus. This is a research 
institution with a couple of hos-
pitals and large meeting facili-
ties. When was the last time that 
you visited a college campus in 
the Midwest? They don't look 
the same, in fact, a real college 
campus would look foreign to 
most UCSD students, 

This is my plea to those involv-
ed with the Price(y) Center. 
(That's just what I think it is. Pri-
cey!) Do something for the stu-
dents! I n my opinion all that the 
Price(y) Center is isa showpiece 
to gather funds from rich old 
men and women and show off to 
prospective students and their 
parents. 

Of course, La J olla was built 
before UCS D a nd therefore they 
control what happem in their 
area. Have you ever noticed the 
absence of any convenience

what is implied in the -features

disgrace resulting in physical or 
mental harm to any student or 
person attending UCSD" (UCS D 
Student Organization Registra-
tion Applica/ion). 

When I described Alpha Phi 
Alpha's method of pledging, the 
writer irresponsibly chose to 
define it as hazing, and also chose 
to include a non-related campus 
arrest discussed during the inter-
view which had absolutely nothing 
to do with the fratern ity. This 

and doughnut shops there are? 
College students are famous for 
inhaling Pizza's. Well , I'm not 
knocking B.J. 's, but they are the 
only place that delivers in La 
Jolla , Come on, can't we have a 
choice? Not even any special 
deals. Well , there are coupons in 
the Guardian for one ortwo dol-
lars off. It only costs you 5) 6 for 
a medium pizza with two top-
pings and that doesn't even 
include the tip to the delivery 
person. 

We can't even have concerts 
on campus anymore. I don't go 
to concerts very often, but I like 
the idea that we have them at 
UCSD. You can tell all of your 
friends from out of tate that all 
these bands played at your 
school and they are really im-
pressed . The community of La 
10lla didn't ask fo r a college 
: ampus near them and they've 

~ept that a ttitude. 
Let me share an exam ple 

of so me real collegc towns and 
orne real student center,. My 

favorite example i ~ Oklahoma 
State niversity. 1 know that it 
i, much bigger than CSD and 
ha\ a greater avallabllt" 01 f und~ 

blatantly disgraced the ethics and 
long history of moral values 
upheld by our member . 

If the writer personally chooses 
to define hazing as walking and 
dressing alike during an initiation 
period (which is the only thing we 
discussed in terms of Alpha Phi 
Alpha pledging) , then the 
Guardian should look for another 
features writer who is more cap-
able of revealing the facts dis-
cussed during interviews. 

Let the record show that Alpha 
Phi Alpha in no way commits, 
participates, or condones acts of 
hazing. 

In reference to our non-IFC 
affiliation, we are subjected to 
the same criteria as otherfraterni-
ties which are based upon mem-
bership numbers, IFC rules and 
regulations, and campus quotas. 

It is a shame when res ponsible 
reporting is threatened, when 
names of nationally recognized 
leaders uch as Martin Luther 
K.ing,Jr., mentioned in the article, 
are used .to gain sensationalism at 
the expense of the innocent. 

Alpha Phi Alpha maintains its 
purpose to demonstrate leader-
ship, provide community service, 
and to encourage academic excel-
\ence.

It has lots of sports (well, foot-
ball is kind of in trouble right 
now, but you know what I 
mean). It has a rea) student cen-
ter. It's smack dab in the middle 
of campus. Everyone goes there. 
It has coffee, cheap food, video 
games, pool tables; it's just the 
place t hangout. And, it's always 
open. The only place around 
here that is always open is 
Roberto's, and it takes 15 min-
utes to get there. 

At OSU the student center is 
popular with everyone ... even 
the professors. It's such a great 
place to be that even the high 
school students go and hang out 
(I'm not saying that we want 
students from UC High and La 
Jolla High coming over to hang 
out with us, but it's just a really 
great place). The whole town 
has hangouts where students 
gather during the wcek and on 
weekends. 

My point in all of this is, 
UCSD needs some place lik e 
this . Student, aren't really get-
ting the full college ex perience 
here. I feel ~chool i almo t like

Article 
Misleading 
Editor: 

In regards to the opinionated 
article entitled "Fraternities and 
Sororities Spark Continuing 
Debate" (Guardian. Jan. 26) writ-
ten by Marla Schneidman, we, 
the members of Delta Sigma Theta 
Sorority Inc. , would like to 
address a few issues. 

First, we would like to make a 
point of clarification. Although 
we are not recognized by the 
Pan hellenic Council at UCSD, 
we are recognized by the National 
Pan hellenic Council at San Diego 
State University. Since we are a 
city-wide chapter, which the 
author failed to note, we have not 
encountered the need to be rec-
ognized by the Council at UCSD. 

Secondly, we would like to 
state that we are products of our 
respective black communities, and 
by being such we do not believe 
that we are helping people "less 
fortunate than ourselves." Rather, 
we are contributing to the uplift-
ment of the communities from 
whence we came. 

Furthermore, we do not con-
done our organization being men-
tioned in this article which has 

See SORORITY, page 6 

home after midnight to go to 
bed. 

I don't feel like the Price(y) 
Center is going to change my 
life. It won't be open all night, 
and no one has polled me or any 
of my friends as to what we are 
looking for in a place to gather. 
What about other colleges that 
have popular student centers? 
Have they examined them? A 
ballroom? What do we need a 
ballroom for? A bowling alley 
seems much more appropriate 
to me. 

I may be paying for part of 
the Price(y) Center through my 
fees, but that doesn 't mean 
that r have to like it. I'm not 
calling for all of you to avoid the 
Price(y) Center like the plague, 
but 1 am calling for the adminis-
tration to look at stude nts' needs 
and not their own. You know, I 
don't even care that they are 
spending so much money to 
make this thing look great. 
(There they go impressing tho e 
people agai n.)

KSDT's Format Serves 
Student Need for Diversity 

Depeche Mode, and U2, we 
uggest 91 X. The point is that 

ONE station can't possibly suit 
everyone' ta te, although KSDT 
is more diverse than most. Not 
many stations offer such a wide 
array of specialty shows ranging 
from jazz to reggae,like KSDT, 

like you claim we do to give

It's not all Butthole Surfers. 

Editor: 
As one of life's totally addicted, 

and so far unrepentant record 
buyers I was alarmed at the threat-
ened closure of Assorted Vinyl, 
and even more perturbed at the 
recent letter (Guardian, Jan. 26) 
by Gregory MacCrone, Dan Vel-
jovich and Amy Stern. 

I should preface my comments 
by saying that business efficiency 
at A V does need to improve, but 
that it can only do so through 
investment of extra funds in the 
enterprise. More paid employees 
are needed, in particular. Sti\1, the 
rationale Mr. MacCrone uses in 
criticizing A V only highlights the 
limitations of his own tastes in 
music, and his ignorance of the 
need for student owned and run 
enterprises based as much on the 
need for services as profit. 

Strangely enough, A V does 
have a diverse range of records in 
stock which caters to the most 
eclectic of tastes: from rockabi\1y 
rebels to punk pariahs, from jiv-
ing jazz to fantastic funk , Mr. 
MacCrone will find it there, and 
for a cheaper price than at Where-
house or Tower Records. Take 
my advice, Gregory, be adventu-
rous and buy yourself something 
new and untried, you may sur-
prise yourself yet. 

In pointing to the success of the 
Grove Caffe he fails to tell us that 
he is its manager. If the Grove 
made a 550,000 profit last year 
why doesn't he drop his prices just 
a little? 

Editor: 
This letter is in response to 

Gregory MacCrone, Dan Velo-
vich, and Amy Stern's letter 
(Guardian, Jan. 26). The letter 
seemed unaware of some basic 
facts, and we would like to clar-
ifya few things. 

The first point to address is 
the student body's lack of access 
to KSDT. As it should be we\1 
known, KSDT is not heard on 
campus because it does not have 
an FCC license. Although it is 
broadcast on 540 AM, it is very 
difficult to receive. It is very dif-
ficult to obtain a license in the 
San Diego area because Mexico 
does not regulate their stations 
like the United States does. 
KSDT is in the process of obtain-
ing one now - at last estimate it 
will take about eighteen months. 

The fact that the students 
only hear KSDT one hour a day 
over the hump is not KSDT's 
fault . If you would like to hear it 

KSDT Radio 
Important 
Editor: 

In response to the letter crit-
icizing the management of KSDT 
(Guardian, Jan. 26), we would 
like to clarify the misconceptions 
held by those authors and hope-
fully enlighten them to their ig-
norance ofthe philosophy behind 
college radio and the present sit-

more, press the administration . 
They limit the hump speakers. 
Why isn't KSDT broadcasted in 
the cafeterias and the commuter 
lounges? That is a reasonable 
request. KSDT doesn 't serve the 
community because it is physi-
cally impossible. 

We know these facts because 
we are "deejays" at KSDT. We 
do not have purple hair, we do 
not smoke, and our favorite 
color is not black . We are "nor-
mal" by most peoples' stand-
ards. The letter claims that 
KSDT is "inhibiting student 
involvement." We\1, we were not 
stopped from pursuing the train-
ing and becoming DJs. Stares 
and narrow attitudes are not 
welcome, helpful people with 
their own ideas are. 

If you would like to hear Tif-
fanY, listen to B-IOO. If you are a 
Bon Jovi fan , tune into 90.3 or 
101.5 maybe. If you want to 
hear INXS , Joe Jackson , 

in the letter (Depeche Mode, U2, 
Guns ' n' Roses). The accessibility 
of these artists today no longer 
necessitates college radio airplay. 
In fact, it is the artists currently 
played on college radio who will 
be tomorrow's popular acts. 

It is appropriate that as college 
students we not be molified by the 
status quo but rather insist upon 
social progress as an element of 
the future. It is from this pretense 
thai college radio takes its alter-
na tive sta nce. 

If you would have listened to 
KSDT about seven years ago, 
you would have heard the strug-
gling U2. A year ago we can 
remember marvelling over a new 
band named They Might Be 
Giants - right before 91 X 
picked up their single "Don't 
Let's Start" as a heavy rotation. 
Many oftoday's big groups, like 
R.E. M ., got their start from col-
lege radio. 

My point is that college radio 
fits a need just like B-IOO and 
9lX. Its purpose is to expose 
independent bands and educate 
people to the world of music 
that surrounds them. By men-
tioning the Dead Kennedys we 
think the authors assume that 
the entire station is nothing but 
punk rock. We ask you (not beg, 

We at KSDT suscribe to this 
notion of offering our listeners a 
wider variety of unkown artists 
meriting consideration. Unfor-
tunately, our ability to reach a 
broader audience is limited for 
two reasons. First, because of 
noise restriction, the administra-
tion has confined our broadcasts 
over the hump to the noon hour. 
Secondly, the impacted San Diego 
radio market impedes our access 
to the airwaves. As of yet , the 
FCC has not seen fit to grant us a 

On our show we play the 
Jasmine Minks, Meat Puppets, 
Dead Milkmen, Close Lobsters, 
Scruffy the Cat, Big Dipper, 
dB's, etc. one of the e bands 
are "obtuse, offensive, Eastern 
hemisphere underground" 
bands. They are very similar to 
popular styles of music, only 
they are not popular enough to 
yield heavy rotation somewhere 
else . . . yet. If you turn on KSDT 
and you do not like what you 
hear, wait two hours and try 
again . Every OJ has a different 
style. 

KSDT has a responsibility to 
play music not heard anywhere 
else, for the same reason a jazz 
station like 98 .3 won't play U2. 
Until the student body under-
stands this, nothing will change. 
Sometimes when we close our 
mouths and open our ears, it's 
easier to open our minds. 

Jennifer Cassidy 

broadcast license because there's 
no space available. 

We share your frustrations re-
garding the limitations of our 
broadcast ability and accordingly 
are undertaking every measure 
within our means to acquire this 
longed-for license. Regrettably, it 
is a long and tedious bureaucratic 
process. 

Finally, we at KSDT welcome 
"massive student involvement." 

See KSDT, pace 6 KSDT does have problems 
reaching a large audience, so why 
don't we press for expansion be-
yond campus cable? In San Diego 
we are starved of "alternative" 
music. College radio stations have 
been the breaking ground for 
many of today's major bands -
R.E.M ., Talking Heads, and U2 
come to mind immediately - and 
their role in airing otherwise un-
exposed music needs support, not 
systema tic denial. 

uation at KSDT. r---------------------------------------

What is, after all, wrong with 
"obtuse, offensive, Eastern Hem-
isphere underground music"? The 
ideologically loaded words Mr. 
MacCrone uses here give away 
his inexusably narrow cultural 
bias and make it clear that he is 
the loser in not opening himself 
up to a world full of other musics. 

UCSD students will soon have 
their dream shopping mall and 
with it the all too pervasive tri-
umph of profit motive and con-
sumer mediocrity. I say we should 
pay more attention to, and invest 
more funds in, the margins before 
the Price Center subsumes all 
through its glitzy commercialism. 
For those of us who prefer a good 
LP to a lousy cup of coffee there 
may yet be salvation. 

Martin Padget 

The philosophy of college radio 
is not difficult to grasp. It is the 
philosophy of alternatives. College 
radio is not intended to compete 
on the commercial radio market, 
it is rather designed to expose 
unknown artists who generally do 
not receive commercial airplay. 

Many of to day's popular artists 
made their debut on college radio, 
including the groups mentioned

We at the Women's Resource

that the "A. S. Wastes Money." 
Lowrance is outraged at the A.S .

Johnson and Phillip Agee total-
ing $4250, but show her ignor-
ance by assuming that this amount 
constitutes large honorariums for 
nationally known speakers. Any-
one who has worked on such a 
project knows that they are not. 

On the contrary, the WRC has 
had a history of sponsoring pro-
vocative, inspirational and alter-
native programing at UCSD for 
minimal costs. While it also might 
be argued that the $25,000 budget 
for the Sun God Festival, or the 
$14,000 budget for beer at TGs 
thi year, are excessive allocations 
when compared to the $37.000 
allocated for aI/student organiza-
tions for all three quarters, the 
real issue here is education.

The point of bringing alterna-

challenge tudents to reconsider 
their received notions a bout the

sity that fosters debate underlies 
the very concept of a university 
education. 

The WRC i committed to help-
ing c reate that diversity so that 
tudent are exposed to wider 

visions than those represe nted in 
the curriculum. Our events are 
always well attended and the A.S. 
i to be applauded for helping to 
sponsor them. What a stagnant 
life all of us would lead if we only 
heard and listened to things we 
already agreed with. 

Lowrance sta tes that "I have 
yet to see the A.S. support a con-
servative speaker." to which we 
ha ve two responses: first. all any-
one has to do to experience "even 
conservative" viewpoints is pick 
up the San Diego Union or the 
LA . Times, turn on any news 
broadcast, or walk into almost 
any class at UCSD; seco nd, the 
A.S . sponsors student orga niza-
tions that ask for support, and it is 
more than likely that if Lowrance 
put together a program rather

than expecting someone else to 
do it. the A.S. would sponsor it.

UCSD Skate Club Holds Competition 
By MARY BETTY HEARD 
/aJJ Writer 

The UCSD Ready to Shred 
(RTS) Skate Club held a skate-
boarding con test yesterday at the 
club's skateboard ramp located 
off Old Miramar Road . 

Taking first place in the ad-
va nced division was Adam Muzi-
kant who was fo llowed by club 
president Steve Villarreal , Chris 
Cochran, and Guilles Guilpan 
who placed second , third and 
fourth respectively. Lisa Forman 
placed first among the lower div-
ision contestants. 

The contest was judged by Lynn 
Kramer, Nathalie Rictor (a spon-
or from Germany) and Villar-

real. Each contestant was allowed 
two 45-second runs. 

"They're judged on the tricks 
they do, how many tricks they do 
... if they fall, and their overall 
style," said Kramer, who would 
have participated had she not 
torn a ligament in her knee. 

Some of the tricks seen at the 
event included the " Rock and 

RolI,"the "Grind"and the " Invert" 
or " Hand-plant. " 

A "Rock and Roll [i when] 
you rock over the coping (a metal 
or pIa tic "lip" at the top edge of 
the ramp) and then back onto the 
ramp" said Stephanie Person , a 
2 I -year old contestant. 

The Grind consists of a con-
testant grinding or sliding his or 
her skateboard against the edge 
of the coping. 

An Invert is performed when a 
skater grabs the coping with his 
or her hand , slips over, and then 
goes back down the ramp. 

Person was one of two female 
skaters participating Sunday. 
According to her, female skaters 
are a rarity. 

Person said that she enjoys the 
challenge and excitement of skat-
ing. 

"It 's exciti ng because there [are] 
no coaches ... you just learn it ," 
she said . 

According to some skaters, pain 
is a lso a factor in skateboarding. 

Jeff Perry, a contestant and 
student from Morris High School, 
said that when his parents gave

ing lot patrollers. Funding is 
instead coming from both the 
Housingand the Parking budgets. 

According to Jenkins, the patrol 
program began in response to the 
increase in auto theft on campus. 
In 1988, more cars were stolen 
from UCSD lots than ever before. 

"We've got to do something ... 
it's just getting ridiculous," Jen-
kins aid. 

Jenkins suggested that if stu-
dents see anythi ng suspicious, in 
parking lots or a nywhere else on 

campus, they use the call boxes, 
located at various points on cam-
pus. to contact the police. 

He pointed out that "call boxes 
are not used that often," and said 
that people often do not think to 
use them. 

The UCS D police ha ve printed 
a pamphlet titled "Hang On To 
Your Car", which Ii ts ways to 
make a car theft-proof, and 
includes a Motor Vehicle Identi-
fication Card. These pamphlets 
are available at the UCSD police 
department and are beingdistrib-
uted around campus. 

SUPERCOMPUTER 
Continued from pale 1 

" Right now, it takes four 
months in computer time to cal-
culate 1/ 1000 of a second of the 
molecular dynamics in a small 
molecule," Cohen said. 

Cohe n explai ned that the new 
supercomp uter is needed for 
"computa tionally complex" re-
search and will also be able to 
"inve tigate molecules as well as 
large systems of molecules." 

UCSD's supercomputer will 
remain a faster system, though, 
because it has four processors 
while the Scripps Clinic compu-
ter, becau e of cost considerations, 
will operate with j ust one. 

Processors "operate on the 
memory of the computer, where 
data is stored," Cohen explained . 

Although four processors allow 
four jobs to be done simultane-
ously on a ingle comput er, a 
"uni-processor was chosen be-
cau e it was the lea t expensi ve. If 
we had been able to raise $20 mil-
lion as o pposed to $5 million, we 
might have been able to obtain 
four processors," he added . 

Cohe n ex plained the practica l 
applications of supercomputing 
technology by de cribi ng a cur-
rent resea rch project being con-
ducted at the Clinic. 

According to Cohen, research-

Computer graphics are then 

used to visua lize the configura-
tions a nd the researcher gets a 
"movie"ofthe molecule vi brating 
as it moves. 

If the reseArcher spots a change 
in the phy ical shape of the mole-
cule, a nd decides to test the new 
configuration it has taken, the 
"movie" is brought to an organic 
chemist who treats the molecules 
in such a way that keeps the mole-
cule in its new shape. The mole-
cule is finally synthesized and

"[They] said 'Here, son, go kill

Most co ntesta nts wore knee 
pads, elbow pads, and helmet . 
During the competition, skaters 
fell off their boards and slid down 
the wooden ramp on their knees 
several times. 

But, according to one skater, 
"The pain is worth it." 

Edy Haskull (The extra "d" in 
"Eddy"was unnecessary, he said), 
a 23-year-old skater from Costa 
Mesa, has been skating si nce he 
was seven. His favorite trick is the 
Ruckus Front and Slide Grind. 

" I have no fear or care about 
my body," he said, "I balance the 
pain with an Advil and a bong 
tote" he added, laughing. 

The RTS club is an AS-
associated o rganization. It was 
fou nded in 1986 by Steve Villar-
real and Tim Cheng because, 
accordi ng to Villarreal , " We 
wanted to build a ramp." 

The club has approximately 
forty members that practice and 
use the facilities on a regular 
basis, Villarreal said.

STUDENTS DENOUNCE PROPOSED 
FEE INCREASE!!! 

(Sacramento) The University of CallfomJa Student Association today 
denounced the Governor's proposed 10% Increase In student fees for 
1989·90 as a "serious departure from the state's student fee polley," 
accordlgn to Racey Woodruff, UCSA PreSident and a graduate student In 
btoenglneerlng at UC San Francisco. 

The State's student fee policy (Chapter 1523 of the Statutues of 
1985) provides that student fees at the University 0 fcallfornia dn the 
CallfomJa State University are to be set according to a methodology based 
on previous budget Increases. For 1989-90. the fee-selling formula called 
for a 3% Increase In University of California fees. 

"In recent good budget years, we have accepted fee tncreases 
called for by the formula," said Woodruff, "and we expect the state to keep 
lis end of the bargain by adhering to the fonnular In thIS bad budget year. 
Before the studenlfee polley law was enacted. we would have severla years 
without a fee Increase and then one ot two years of large fe.e Increases lJk.e 
thiS one. The fee polley law was supposed to prOVIde Instead for small. 
regu la r increases that are dISengaged from the pollUcs and pressure of the 
state budget process. The govemoe has regened on the deal." 

Woodruff expressed concern that the extraordinary Increase will 
further restrict access to already-squeezed low and middle· Income stu-
dents. 'WhUe some flnanclal aid dollars will be allocated to offsett the 
effects o[ the $144 Increase, financial aid resources are already inade-
quate to meet the needs of CalifornIa's poorest students, and many 
students receive no flnanClal aId at all. We hope that the LegIslature will 
restore the fee Increase to 3% as called [or by state law. " FOR MORE INFO.

Fraternity Focuses on 
Community and Unity 

By JULIE MUNRO 
Features Editor 

Editor's nOle: The position of 
Alpha Phi Alpha on hazing was 
misrepresented in the second of a 
two-pan series on the Greek Sys-
tem in the Jan. 26 issue. The fol-
lowing article about the/raternity 
clarifies their stand. The Guardian 
regrets any misunderstanding this 
may have caused. 

Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity was 
founded in 1906 as a literary club 
by seven black men at Cornell 
Univers ity. San Diego State Uni-
versity student Mark Anthony 
Jones is president of the San 
Diego chapter of the fraternity , 
called Eta Sigma, of which four 
UCSD and ten SDSU students 
are active members. 

"Black men in America were 
not in the greatest situation" in 
1906, Jones pointed out. 

"They had to stick together ... 
If they were not together, a lot of 
thing could happen to them,~ 
said D eymon Fleming, UCSD 
tude nt a nd vice-president of the 

chapter. 
Today, " black enrollment on 

campuses such as UCSDand San 
Diego State is down. San Diego 
State is down 30 percent . .. If you 
don 't have any positi ve rein-
forcement right here," Jones said , 
refering to his fratern ity brothers. 

Fleming pointed out that a 
high percentage of the students 
who "go Greekw graduate. Accord-
ing to Jones, 90 percent of Alpha 
Phi Alpha finish earning their 
degrees. 

Their chapter, which originated 
at UCSD in 1972, is one of the 
strongest in the nation and has a 
chance of being awarded the 
na.ional chapter ofthe year. This 
is earned by best demonstrating 
the qualities on which the frater-
nity is based : mainly deeds (such 
as community service), scholar-
ship, and love for all mankind . 

The fraternity produces the 
Martin Luther King, Jr. parade in 
San Diego. They also put on an 
anti-<irug, anti-gang rally in July 
1988 at the Martin Luther King, 
Jr. Recreation Center in south 
east San Diego. In addition to 
television reporters, "gang mem-
bers came out and . . . just checked 
out what was going on, ~ Jones 
aid . This rally included speakers 

and rap music with gospel lyrics. 
The event "allowed for con-

tinued contact~ and a way out for 
anyone interested in breaking 
away from either drugs or gangs, 
explained SDSU student Shawn 
Gupton, chari man of community 
service, 

"We don't give [dances] just to 
havea partY,"The money from the 
pub party they are having on Feb. 
4 with Alpha Kappa Alpha, their 

sister sorority, will go to their 
scholarship fund . They work for 
other projects, such a the home-
less, the Special Olympics and 
diabetes fund raising projects. 

The fraternity also helps the 
members. "First of all, you have a 
common base . . . and it also allows 
you to look toward role models 
that you would want to model 
yourselfafter, "Gupton said. Such 
prominent black people as Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr. , Andrew 
Young (mayor of Atlanta), and 
Thurgood Marshall (first black 
Supreme Court Justice) have been 
members of Alpha Phi Alpha . 

The fraternity'S pledge period 
is called being "on line ,. and lasts 
from six to eight weeks. "Line 
brothers" must study five hours 
per day and must maintain a min-
imum 2.5 GPAasactive members. 
"Scholarship comes first ," Jones 
said . 

Anotheremphasi ofthepledge 
period is to "give you a ba e to 
stud y black history . . . forgotten 
history," Jones added . Although 
predominantly black , the frater-
nity i open t o everyone and has 
members of various ethnicities , 
including Asian, Mexican and 
white. There is a "black focu ," 
Jones said . "To me . .. learning 
black history is to their benefit 
too." Fleming said . 

While pledging, "you're to-
gether basically 24 hours per day, .. 
Fleming said . They live together 
and must go everywhere in groups 
of at least two. They may not talk 
to anyone outside the fraternity 
except when necessary, such as 
participating in class, at work , or 
if a parent calls. 

"There are no individuals on 
line, they work in one unit," said 
UCSD student Michael X . 
Richardson, secretary of the fra -
ternity. The purpose is "promot-
ing unity and trying to work 
within a group .. . to pull together 
different personalities ," Richard-
son explained. 

Being on line "really promotes 
leadership ... they really want to 
be active in something, " Fleming 
said . One active is even SDSU's 
A .S . president. 

"It cuts off your wasted time 
and it teaches you to maximize 
your ability," Gupton said, "It 
allows you to realize parts of 
yourself, parts of your talents that 
you didn't know were there. 

"There's not that many black 
people on this campus anyway, so 
when you see six people running 
in line, wearing all black ... of 
course you're more noticeable," 
Jones said . The fraternity does 
not, however, practice hazing. it is 
against thei r national policy. 

Their fraternity is a member of 
the National Panhellenic Coun-
cil, a nationwide organization 
which includes four fraternities

Amnesty Int' Works to Free

To Julie Kietzman. concern for 
fellow humans, no matter where 
they may be, seemsa logical thing. 
But the way some governments 
treat their people isanotherthing: 
"I've read some of the thing that

UCSD Chapter 

To try to make sen e out 01 
nonsense, Kietzman got involved. 
She now heads UCSD's Amnesty 
International (AI) chapter, a 
branch of the worldwide 
zation founded to advocate 
an rights and work for the 
of political prisoners.

last year, 
student Paul Johnston started

in September. 

Each week, Kletzmanand 
Amnesty International officers 
Iy students to write letters in 
sponse to "Urgent Action" 
tins. The bulletins warn of 
human rights abuses in other 
tries - cases of tonure, 
tion, and prisoners held wit

sion of political views. AI vo 
teers stationed in the count 
where the abuse is suspected re-
search and verify the details of the 
ca e before it is relayed through 
the bulletin. 

"There was a lady Ijust wrote a 
letter on who was born in prison 
and stayed there 31 years," KIetz-
man said. "For no reason . She 
wasjust released. She hadn't done 
anything ... 

United Nations Declaration 
Amnesty International holds 

countries accountable to the Uni-
ted Nations' Universal Declara-
tion of Human Rights, igned by 
all member countries after World 
War II. In 1977, AI won the 

obel Peace Pri7.c for its promo-

tion of the declaration. Through

people out there who are 
'Hey, we won't let 

criticize the fact 
ing human rights." 

A I member Laura Clark be-
lieves the universality of the or-
ganization'S basic message also 
contributes to its success: "I thi nk 
that most people don't have a 
problem trying to help prisoner 
who haven 't advocated or used 
violence. That' not too hard for 
mo t people to accept." 

Different Perspectives 
The existence of a choice of 

cases to work on makes AI even 
more agreeable to volunteers. A 
"menu" for activism is presented 
each meeting: several Urgent 

Actions bulletins are presented 
from which members can choose. 
"Amcnsty leaves a lot of avenues 
open for different peop le with 
very different perspectives and 

of how the world works, and 
it should work, to all come

. Well, they don't have to. 

They can write letters to prisoners 
of conscience." 

Despite the size of its potentia l 
membership, Kietzman said the 
turn-out at their meetings could 
still improve. "Part of the prob-
lem is that people don't know 
we're on campus. Part of the 
problem is that people don't re-

I t is Friday on the UCSD cam pus. You walk fro m class 
to class - the last lectures of 

the week. A low, rhythmic beat 
reverberates against the cement, 
subt ly reminding you that it's the 
end of the week.

front of the hump you see a group 
of individuals beat ing on bongos, 
banging on water bottles and 
chanting occasionally. You can 
even see the "Jolt guyW adding 
heavy metal lyrics to their ethnic 
beat, affectionately referred to as 
afro metal. Has t he TG started 
early? 

T he drum mers have been play-

years and, as of last q uarter, they

The group, however, remains 
nameless by choice. "We've had 
some ideas like Rhythm ColJec-
tive, Pagan Skin Beaters - but 
that had religious connotations, 
and Rebel Drums, but I like the 
name &at." one drummer said.

12 Mondal', Januan' 30. 1989 

Bongo 
Drummers 
Continued from pale 11 
p e rcussion background 
However, the group i targeted 
toward those with no previou 
experience. The only requirement 
i the ability to pick up one of the 
many instruments and strike up a 
beat. 

"It's not like a [closed] group ... 
if you're just walking by and 
decide to sit down and start play-
ing, they welcome you," drummer 
Zachary Zaidman said . 

The concept of the Friday jam 
grew out of an anti-apartheid 
movement in the s'pring of '85 
called the "Coalition for a Free 
South frica." Students slept at 
the Humanities Library and 
marched from rallies at the hump 
to the Chancellor's complex to 
protest UCSD's investments in 
corporations supporting white 
South Africa and suppressing the 
black civil rights movement there. 
By camping out, dancing, and 
drumming, students conveyed 
their message to the UC Regents, 
who eventually divested in 1987. 

" In this way, drums mobilized 
individuals," senior David Simer-
man said. 

According to seniors Simer-
man and Arnie Schoenberg, orig-
ina to rs of the group, drums can 
signify opposition as well a pro-
vide enterta inment. Both have 
played for events such a s the ant i-
Bu h rally at cri pp and the fil m-
Ing of Cover Up, a docu mentary 
about the Iran-Contra a ffair. 

"The only way to ma kc a socie-

tal change i to destroy linear 
time," choenberg said. 

SemorG.s. Hajimfeel thesame 
way. "Drumming represents an 
anarchic lifestyle .... It's also a 
different level of communication." 
he said . 

Be ide political and traditional 
musical views, many drummers 
have unique rea on for playing. 

"Musically .. . it 's to explore 
percu sion intuitively because 
there is no structure," senior Cece 
Sellgren said. 

For student Pete Emanuele. 
MIt's fun and a form ofrelaxation." 

And Steve Bloch, who has been 
drumming consistently for a year 
and a half. plays "because it's 
here." 

Individua ls who are interested 
in drumming can participate in 
the Frida>, jam as well as visit the 
Che Cafe on Saturdays at noon 
for more structured playing with 
instructor such a Janite Agin-
dotan, a Nigerian master drum-
mer. 

"He teache in a cultural con-
text by giving the story behind 
each piece," Schoenberg said. 

0, on Friday, when walking 
past the hump on your way from 
class to class, m o bilize yourself 
and part icipate. Form your own 
un ique reasons fo r playing or 
play fo r no reason a t a ll.

Fraternity 
Continued from page 10 
and four sororitie . They are not a 
member of the UCSD Intra-
Fraternity Council (IFC). Their 
chapters at UCLA, UC Riverside 
and Long Beach State University. 
however, are members of their 
IFC s. 

The UCSD IFC has never 
denied Alpha Phi Alpha mem-
bership on the ba i of pledging 
activitie . "No one has ever aid 
that," Fleming explained, the is ue 
has never come up. The fact is the 
IFC requires fraternities to have 
50 members. "( don't think they're 
doing it purposely to keep us 
from being in there, but we will 
never have that many," Fleming 
said. 

Alpha Phi Alpha does not try 
to make members fit a mold . 
"When we pick a person, we like 
them for what they are," Fleming 
aid, so they do not take on 

members just to have more mem-
bers. 

As fo r promoting or inhibiting 
interaction between themselves 
and other students, Fleming said, 
"we're going to have a DJ [at the 
dance] playing rap, soul music ... If, 
for instance, while people like 
that , then they're welcome to 
come ... We're not breaking our 
necks to satisfy . . . . .. 

"You can't satisfy everybody. 
There' no way on the world that 
everybody would be atisfied ," 
Richardson finished. 

"But hopefully everybody can 
understand, and if they would 
like to do what we're doing, we 
welcome them," Fleming con-
cluded .

T he Penguins rece ntly went 
NAIA, and have started giving 
sc holarshi ps to their athletes. 
Triton Head Coach Tom Mar-
shall pointed out that "It·s hard to 
get a reading as to how good they 
really are, and how fast they will 
get good." However, he was very 
pleased with the game. 

UCSD was up by thirty points 

midway into the second period, 
and Marshall " had only fresh-
men and so phomores in the 
game for the last 10 minutes." 
Dominican showed up with seven 
men , and thus had to play most of 
the starters for the entire game. 
With two minutes left to play in 
the game, Dominican only had 
four men on the floor, and two of 
those men had committed four 
fouls . One of the Dominican lead-
ers, forward Doug Stewart, com-
plained that the refs "were calling 
pitty-pat fouls ... they were just

awful," Still, with four players on 
the court, Dominican was a ble to 
finish the game. 

The scoring for UCSD was 
extremely spread o ut . a nd all play-
ers who aw playing time cored 
at least once. Sophomore Erik 
Quigley led the team with 20 
points, followed by both Dan 
Troy and Greg Kund with 16 
apiece. Quigley was also tied for 
the team lead in rebounding, as 
both he and Rick Batt hauled 
down seven boards. Stewart and 
Steve Whitley of Dominican each 
led their team with 18 points. 

Dominican never really made 
any sort of run , but as soon as it 
appeared as if they might cut into 
UCSD's 20-plus point lead, the 
Tritons would throw in a 3-pointer 
or make a steal and subsequent 
layup. 

Speaking of the Penguins, sen-
ior Bill Gerlach mentioned that 
"they are not a very good team, 
but they are definitely improv-
ing." He also called the blowout 
"a great opportunity for the 
bench." Coach Marshall was also 
elated to get in a lot of quality 
playing time for his bench, and 
said he was "pleased with what I 
sa w tonight. ". 

Marshall did say that "it 's hard 
coming off the bench ... trying to 
maintain the tempo ... wanting to 
show the coach what you can do 
... knowing you can go in to any 
offensive set you want being up 30 
points. Sometimes you forget 
about the defense in those situa-
tions."

about his squad . He said that 
there is "no coach in this country 
who doesn't experience a rebuild -
in.2 year, and even though it's a 
cliche, we are in a rebuilding year." 
Marshall feels his sophomores 
and first year students are "im-
proving every game." 

Doug Stewart of Dominican 
explained that there has been a 19t 
of problems with the Penguin 
team lately, that they "started the 
season with 16 [players), and are 
down to just seven. Our best 
player quit just three days ago." 

The Tritons next test is away at 
La Verne on Wednesday night, and 
then they play host to Cal State

The UCSD Guardian SPORTS 

Lacrosse Dominates LMU 
By JONCARLO MARK 
Stall Writer 

In case you are wondering 
who is carrying the biggest sticks 
on campus. look no further 
than the men's lacrosse team. 
Ye terday, the Tritons reamed 
the Loyola Marymount Lions 
in their league opener, 14-4. 

According to Head Coach 
Bruce Sei tz. the team played 
with a n "aggressive defense and 
cont ro lled offense" in the vic-
tory. 

LM U scored the first goal of 
the game, but was then bar-
raged by six unan wered UCS D 
goals. Leading the way for the 
Tritons in the attack was sopho-
more Juan Milla n, who scored 
four of the first six UCSD 
points. After two periods, the 
Tritons led 6-1 and had obvious 
control of the tempo. 

The second half showcased 
more of the same Triton domi-
nance. Junior Brad Bunten 
provided three assists and scor-
ed one goal and Millan added 
two assists to his tally. Also 
coming on strong for the Trit-
ons were Dave Jordan Smith 
and Chad Taylor who each 
muscled two goals. 

However, it was the ferocious 
Tri~on defense that took Loy-
ola out of the game. UCSD 
goalies Joe Brown and Tony 
Prestogacimo had 10 and six 
saves respectively. They received 

Rima 

Junior Brad Bunten (9) had three assists in the second half. 

excellent support from hard-
hitting defensemen Sven Hay-
nie. Orion Alcalay, and Chuck 
Leslie. The trio knocked the 
Lion attack silly all game long. 

Coach Seitz has noticed an 
improvement in team unity 
which is '.l key to the team's suc-
cess. Optimism for the season is 

prevalent within the team, es-
pecially si nce their early season 
victory over SDS U. Next Sat-
urday the Tritons will battle 
Claremont on Warren East at I 
p.m. Claremont is one of the 
tougher teams in the league, but 
then again, Loyola was also 
supposed to be tough.

Continued from page 20 

In t he epee. where hits to any 
part of t he body score points, the 
Triton blanked Pomona 9-0 while 
J ohn Keller, Todd Dubnicoff. and 
John Landenslager each domi-
nated their bouts. 

Another blowout occured in 
the sa bre, an event involvi ng 
cava lry-like lashing, as Darin 
Wessel. Andy Wagner, and Avi 
Friedlich combi ned for a 7-2 score 
to finish off the Broncos. 

Led by se nior captain Kathy 
Cox, the women's team shut out 
Cal Poly 12-0 and managed to get 
by Fullerton 5-4, prompting An-
tonelli to say, "With all of the 
injuries, J was little worried , but 
now I'mjust glad we beat them." 

More important for the men 
than Saturday'S win, however, 
was a trip to Baltimore back on 
Jan. 6-8 in which the Tritons 
faced many tough teams, includ-
ing Penn State, Columbia, MIT 
and Brandeis. 

The Tritons placed eighth out 
of 10, and although they had to 
miss some events to catch their 
plane, they still managed to im-
press. " I think that it's a witness to 
their enthusiasm and desire to do 
well that they went to Baltimore 

Monda}', January 30. 1989 17 

a nd com peted against so many 
tough team s." Antonelli commen-
ted . 

I ncidentally, the fencers had to 
pay their own way, as the Tritons' 
budget does not allow for out-of-
state travel. 

Though costly. the trip proved 
rewarding. Friedman, Wessel, 
Keller, Allan Hovey, and Peter 
Pak all improved the toughness 
of their schedules, an important 
factor in deciding who is invited 
to the Nationals. 

Next weekend, the Tritons will 
face SDSU and UCSB in a tour-
nament at State.

Rugby Crushes Oxy 
By SCOTT PREGERSON 
Contributing Writer 

The UCSD rugby team re-
mained undefeated on Satur-
day by beating a much larger 
Occidental College team 24-3 . 
Occidental is notorious for 
being the hardest hilling and 
physical side in league compe-
tition due mainly to their 
"football mentality" approach 
to the game. However, it was 
rugby skills,experience, and 
determination which won the 
contest for UCSD. 

There was no score midway 
through the first half when 
John Tellenbach capped off a 
brilliant backline move with 
the first try of the game. Adrian 
Mansbridge and Shea McMa-
nus were on the assist as the 
Tritons took a 6-0 lead . Oxy 
then narrowed the gap to 6-3 
with a penalty kick. 

The fi nal '15 minutes of the 

•• ' .,' 0 " _ 

first half, though , were domi-
nated by the hard-hitting Trit-
ons, Adam Lefl<:off hit a drop 
kick to push the score to 9-3, 
and then Pete Christiansen in-
tercepted an errant pass for an 
easy try and a 15-3 halftime 
score. 

The second half was even 
more physical than the first , as 
Oxy tried to get back into the 
game with intimidation . 
UCSD, however, fought even 
harder and shut the door on 
Oxy when Christiansen made 
a break and gave a great pass 
to Lefl<:off in support who went 
on to score the try. Tellenback 
was 4-4 on the day with his 
kicks , hitting one penalty and 
three conversions. 

Other outstanding players 
for UCSD included John Sci-
voletto on the wing, Pat Gies-
man at break, and Phil Tencer 
at prop. 

The second side also faced a

Myths 
Continued from pale 20 
to be unfair to our Tri tons. While 
our men were shooting free 
throws, various colleges were try-
ing to out-cheer and out-scream 
each other. Sure, it's nice to win 
the cheer contest, but in basket-
ball, when you want to make a 
deliberately obnoxiou noise, the 
point is usually to make that noise 
when the other team- is shooting. 
Unless I'm mistaken, it's good for 
the home team to make its free 
throws. What I'm trying to say is 
that even on a night meant to 
show school spirit , the only spirit 
showed was intraschool hostilities. 

Some people believe this 
school is conservative, does not 
want any spirit, and does not 
want to shake the image it has 
created of itself. What about the 
Untouchables fiasco? The stu-
dents wanted to go to a concert, 
and a lot of them s howed up. The 
attendance led school officials to 
comment that the school seems 
to be changing its image. Had 
the proper facilities been availa-
ble, such as a football stadium, 
the Untouchables might have 
been able to play to a more than 
eager crowd . This school show 
signs of wanting to shrug off its 
lackluster reputation as an aca-
demic melting pot , but ca n 't 
seem to find a way to do it. A 
football team would help solve 
that problem. 

Lastly, I beg to differ with 
anyone who says that the students 
don't want a football team. Of 
the students who voted last year, 
59.7 percent wanted a team, but 
66.6 percent were needed to pass 
the football referendum. Fifty-
nine percent of the voting public 
of America could have gotten 
Mike Dukakis elected. Unfortu-
nately. referendums passed at 
UCSD require higher voter per-
centages than presidential elec-
tions do, but that's beside the 
point. It is true that the over-
whelming majority of UCSD, as 
of last year , does not want a 
football team; however, a major-
ity of the school does desire a 
team. My hat goes off to the stu-
dents who spent hours orches-
trating last year's referendum, 
and I appeal for a student or stu-
dents to come forward and start 
the rally again next year. Hope-
fully , some of you will see 
through all of the myth, and the 
next time there is a vote, you will 
think twice before buyi ng Hall's 
cough drops that don't work and 
leave a foul taste in your mouth .

Women's Basketball Wins Seventh Game in a Row 

Hot Tritons Mutilate U ta Cruz 
By BRIAN ITOW 
Staff Writer 

The Triton women's basketball 
team tied a ix-year-old chool 
record by winning its seventh 
traight game - and on the way, 

they stepped on a Banana Slug. 
Friday night at the Triton 

Pavilion, UC San Diego built a 
quick 16-0 lead en route to an 
easy 98-36 trouncing of the out-

Bernadette Diepenbrock and the 
Tritons stepped all over the 
Banana Slugs on Friday evening. 

matched UC Santa Cruz Banana 
Slugs. 

The Tritons were able to over-
come orne sloppy play in the first 
half with a stifling defense that 
forced 17 UCSC turnovers and 
allowed the hosts to build a 47-20 
halftime lead. The 20 Banana 
Slug point were the lowest the 
Tritons had previously held an 
opponent to this sea on. 

But, in the second half, they did 
themselves one better: they held 
the Slugs to 16 points by limiting 
them to 25 percent shooting and 
causing II more turnovers. For 
the game, the Slugs shot only 27 
percent from the field while com-
mitting 28 turnovers. 

The Tritons, on the other hand, 
set a new school record by con-
necting on 54.5 percent of their 
shots. They were led by Tracy 
Ragatz's 18 points and 7 as ists , 
and Jill Koster's 18 points. 

Ragatz was impressed by the 
team 's performance . " This 
could've been a game we took for 
granted - looking forward to the 
San Bernardino game - but we 
worked hard and didn't let down .... 

"After we built that 16-0 lead ," 
said junior Chris Ely, "we didn't 
want to sit on it; we wanted to 
continue to build the lead, to keep 
on working." 

And work they did , as the game 
quickly became little more than a 
spectacle for coreboard watchers. 

The big question of the night 
became not whether they would 
win or lose, but rather whether 
they would score 100 points or 
not. And they had a shot. With 
seven minutes remaining, UCSD 
led 87-32 and needed only 13 
points to reach the century mark, 

PrIer MHSrobian/ Guardian 

Tracy Ragatz and UCSD flew away from UCSC by 62 points. 

but they scored only II points the 
rest of the way and fell just short. 

The Tritons w~re clearly the 
dominant team in this contest. 
Everyone involved acknowledged 
that. "'We knew they weren't going 
to be a very trong team," said 
UCSD coach Judy Malone. "I 
think we knew it was going to be 
an easy game, so in the first half, 

we didn't work as hard as we 
could have . . . and we played a 
little sloppy. But, we just played 
good defense and began to play 
with more intensity . .. 

"UCSD has a great team. They 
have everything: offense, defense, 
rebounding - and they showed it 
tonight," said Santa Cruz coach

Fencing Stabs Cal Poly Pomona, Fullerton St. 
Men and Women Improve to 9-2, 10-2 Respectively 

By CHRIS ZAHARIAS 
Staff Writer 

They d o not receive much press 
coverage, and many people on 
thi campus do not even know 
they exist, but the UCSD inter-

collegiate fencing team keeps 
plugging along, quietly racking 
up win after win. 

Following sweeps of Cal Poly 
Pomona and CSU Fullerton in a 
three team tournament held in the 
Rec Gym on Saturday, the men's 
and women's fencing teams, coach-

Ken Relnslein/ Guardian 
Senior captain Kathy Cox led the women to a 12-0 shutout over Cal 
Poly Pomona. 

ed by Lynne Antonelli , improved 
their records to 9-2 and 10-2 
respectively in front of a crowd of 
15. 

Against Cal Poly, the men's 
team won handily 24-3, while the 
women kunked Pomona 12-0. 

In the foil , where players at-
tempt to reach their opponents' 
trunks with yard-long, flexible 
blades, men's senior captain Ar-
non Friedmann won all of his 
bouts, while battling the flu at the 

same time. Friedmann was so 
fatigued that he did not even 
warm up before the bout, hardly 
looking like the possessor of a 27-
2 record. 

By winning all of his bout , 
Friedmann kept himself in fir'st 
place in the IFCSC (Intercolle-
giate Fencing Conference of South-
ern California), and kept himself 
in the running for a trip to the 
NCAA tournament in April.

Men's Basketball Rolls Over 
Hapless Dominican College 

By DAVID POTICHA 
Staff Writer 

Saturday night , the UCSD 
Tritons' men 's basketball team 
completely dominated the Dom-
inican ollege Penguins by a 114-
78 score. The win improved the 
Tritons' record to 7- 12. 

The preceding night, a n 85-74 
victory over UC anta Cruz had 
improved their record to 6- 12. 
Again t the UCS Banana lugs, 
sophomore Gordon McNeill 
cored 23 points and added 12 re-

bounds while Kirk Kramer scored 
18. 

On aturday night , the Pen-
guin imply played awful , and 
probably would have had a better 
evening elling frozen yogurt . At 

the start of the game, the score 
was tied at 0-0, and that wa the 
la t time Dominican wa ever 
close. UCSD quickly pulled out 
to a 21 - 12 lead, and held a 54-35 
halftime lead . 

There were many factor that 
contributed to the UCSD lead . 
The Tritons hot 53 percent from 
the floor in the first half, and 42 
percent from three-point range, 
sinking 5 of 12 hot from down-
town . By the conclusion of the 
game, UCSD wa shooting a siz-
zling 58 percent from the floor, 
and an unheard of 53 percent 
from three-point land . In con-
trast , Dominican only hot 40 
percent from the floor, and 40 
percent from three-point range.

Hall of Myths: 
What's Wrong 
With a UCSD 
FootbaN Team? 

By DAVID POTICHA 
Staff Writer 
(Editor's Note: This is the 
second part of this commen-
tary, theftrst part of which ran 
in the Thursday, Jan. 26 issue 
of the Guardian.) 

There are a multitude of 
reasons why having a team 
would improve this school. 
One thing a football team 
does is to improve overall 
school spirit, because foot-
ball consistently draws the 
biggest crowds of any sport, 
at any level, anywhere. 

There is another reason 
why football improves all-
around school spirit. Big 
crowds tend to rub off on 
the lesser watched sports, 
and the other UCSD sports 
teams would start drawing 
bigger crowds, something 
they dearly need . Tracy 
Ragatz, a senior on UCSD's 
women's basketball team, 
commented that it " ... would 
be nice to play for a big 
crowd just once." This 
comment was made after 
the Tritons had been beaten 
Point Lorna Nazarene Col-
lege by only two points in 
the final seconds, in front 
of just 30 people. Ragatz 
called the crowd of 30 "one 
of the better crowds we've 
had this year." 

Do I feel that the UCSD 
sports teams simply aren't 
good enough to capture 
your attention? Of course 
not. The other squads at 
UCSD are exciting to 
watch, and don't get half 
the attention they deserve. 
How many people watched 
the Tritons battle UCSD in 
water polo this fall? The 
game was fantastic to 
watch, but had a crowd of 
maybe 150. Our otherteams 
can draw crowds, but not 
big ones, usually not during 
the regular season, and cer-
tainly not ones comprised 
of local fans. However, 
football games could pos-
sibly entice the La Jolla 
community to come to 
campus and maybe feel a 
little closer to the school is 
is always so desperately 
trying to alienate itself 
from . Our other teams are 
successful - in fact, UCSD 
sports are very successful 
in Division III, but no one 
recognizes UCSD for inter-
collegiate sports, not even 
its own students. Even a 
losing football team is a 
start towards such recogni-
tion, and a few years down 
the line, a winning football 
team would do wonder for 
school pride. 

How many of you think 
there already is a lot of 
school cheer and spirit? 
And how many of you
