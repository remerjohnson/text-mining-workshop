BERKELEY, Calif. - A 
handful of VCB faculty 
members voted. 14-2, on Feb. 5 
to approve a policy which would 
allow students in the school's 
College of Letters and &:iences 
to drop classes until the last day 
of instruction. Only 16 of 700 
notified college-faculty members 
attended the meeting. 1be 
policy, which will go into effect 
next fall after the campus 
Academic Senate is officially 
notified, will be evaluated for 
effectiveness every few years. 
The senate lacks the power to 
overturn the vote because the 
policy only affects one college.

Student Aide 
Allegedly 
Pressured to 
Resign 
DEPARTURE: Woman 
claims she was forced out 
after substitute-teachjng 
By Ivan Delventhal 
News Editor 

A UCSD student employed as a student-
counselor aide in UCSD's Early Academic 
Outreach Program (EAOP) asserted Tuesday 
that she was forced to resign from her position 
after she worked as a substitute tdacher during 
la t week's teacher's strike in the San Diego 
Unified School District. 

Heather Flowe, a 22·year·old Marshall se· 
nior, claimed she was pressured into handing· 
in her resignation by EAOP officials, who 
made her feel as if she had '1eopardized the 
program." 

According to Flowe, after she worked as a 
substitute, EAOP administrators told her that if 
teachers noticed her working for the district 
during the strike, they might prevent their stu· 
dents from participating in EAOP in the future. 

"I don ' t feci like I was dealt with profession· 
ally because [EAOP) didn' t have any policies 
saying that if you crossed picket lines you 
would be forced to resign," Flowe said. 

EAOP officials contend, however, that 
Flowe resigned voluntarily, and that they did 
not urge her to give up her position, despite any 
possible "conflict of interesl." 

"I was just astonished to find oUllhat [Flowe J 
could so totally misunderstand the nature of our 
concern for her safety ... and reverse that and say 
something like we forced her to resign because 
she crossed picket lines," EAOP Program Di· 
rector Eustacio Benitez said. 

''That is not only illegal," he added, "but I 
would never pursue such a thing." 

On Thursday, Feb. I, Flowe said she was 
granted permission by her EAOP supervisor, 
Felipe Rangel, to work at Madison High School 
as a substitute teacher on Friday, Feb. 2, and 
Monday, Feb. 5 - days when she normally 
works for EAOP . 

Rangel admitted last week that he wasn't 
aware of the possible conflict of interest in 
allowing Flowe to work at the high school until 
after he received a memo from Benitez. The 
memo slated that EAOP student-counselor aides 
should be advised not to work in the school

Volleyball Players Say Dannevik May Have Been Forced Out 
PRESSURE: Letter 
from players to Sweet 
could have been factor 
ByD .. Kr.ft 
Senior Staff Writer 

Following the resignation of 
UCSD women's volleyball Head 
Coach Doug Dannevik on Feb. 3, 
team memben revealed lut week-
end that Dannevik may have been 
pressured to step down from the 
position he had held for 17 years. 

According to player statements, 
a letter of complaint about 
Dannevik was submitted by sev· 
eral players to UCSD Athletic Di· 
rector Judy Sweet at the end of the 
1995 season. The letter specifi· 
cally attacked his coaching meth-
ods, players said. 

'1'here has been open commu· 
nication with Judy [concerning 
Dannevik) for a few yean now," 
said one player, who wished to 
remain anonymous. "She's been 
Iteepin.a close eye on our team." 

The players said Dannevik was 
under pressure by officials in the 
UCSD athletic department to make 
changes in his program, and that 
this pressure was a contributing 
factor in his decision to resign. 

Players' demands were articu· 
lated to Sweet through a series of 
coach reviews - a standard pro· 
cedure for all of UCSD's NCAA 
programs. 

"I think that after reviewing the 
final evaluations, [Dannevik) re-
alized that he wu under a lot of 

pressure to improve," one player 
said. "I have confidence that 
[Sweet] put him under a tremen· 
dous amount of pressure to make 
changes. Dannevik had to prove to 
her that he was going to [malee 
them]." 

Players said that Sweet gave 
Dannevik a list of suggested 
changes after the Christmas break 
and met with him approximately 
two weeks . later. At that time, 
Dannevik made the decision to re-

Some panelists argued that 
UCSO's low minority population 
is due to the fact that minority 
students do not feel comfortable 
here. Panelists said that these stu-
dents instead go to other institu-
tions with larger minority popu-

UCSA Convenes Monthly Board of 
Directors' Conference at UCSD 
ACTION: UCSA board 
attacks proposal to cut 
student-regent position 
By Esther Yoon 
Staff Writer 

The University of Califomia Stu-
dent Association (UCSA) Board of 
Directors affirmed its stance on stu-
dent representation, fees and commu-
nity outreach at last weekend's two-
day conference held at UCSO. 

Representatives from all nine UC 
campuses attended the con ference and 
assessed UCSA's advocacy agenda 
for the current academic year. 

The board expressed strong oppo-
sition to the elimination of the stu-
denl-representativeposition on the UC 
Board of Regents, passing a resolu-
tion which stated that "UCSA vehe-
mently and adamantly opposes both 
SP-17 and SP-IS." 

SP-17 would dissolve the student-
regent position, while SP-IS would 
retum tenure authority to the regents 
Both proposals were submitted by 
outgoing Regent Glenn Campbell. 

"[Campbell's proposal] is a coo-
tinuanceofa long line of abuses by the 
Boan! of Regents this year and an 
added insult to the student voice and 
representation," said UCSA Chair Kris 
Kohler, a UC Santa Barbara senior. 

UCSA members were also unim-
pressed with the "unequal treatment" 
which the two student representatives 
on the UCSDChancellor Search Com-
mittee, ASUCSO ~ident Naomi 

Falk and GI'Iduate Student Ass0cia-
tion (GSA) President Sieve Dubb, 
received compared to other represen-
tatives. 

According to Dubb, this unfair 
treatment included the UC Office of 
the President (UCOP) not pennitting 
either studenl 10 see the candidates' 
resurOOs, 

The UCSA approved a resolution 
opposing UCOP's action, which both 
UCSO's A.S. and GSA councils 
passed recently. 

Both Dubb and Fall. requested in-
formation on "any possible candi-
dates for the chancellorship" from 
othercampus' UCSA representatives, 
in light of UCOP's ''unresponsive-
ness," 

In other matters, members of the 
UCSA Fees and Financial Aid Com-
millce discussed a survey on the im-
pact of "differential fees" for pre-
professional students. 

Oifferential fees, according to the 
UCSA, are "a way of singling oul a 
certain curriculum and charging in-
creased fees as compared to the gen-
eral student population." 

The commillee also discussed the 
"Scholarshare" program proposed by 
Assemblyman Brooks Firestone (R-
Santa Barbara), which, in Firestone's 
words, will "facilitate students' fund-
ing of post-secondary education ... 
[and] provide guidance and an extra 
incentive forthecitizens of California 
toplan and provide for theirchildren's 
post-secondary, educational, financial 
needs."

If passed, the program would "cre-
ate a partnership between the state 
government, the individual investor 
and the private sector, by the stale of 
Calirornia matching a participating 
citizen's interest earned on a tax -free, 
cducationaJ-only savings accounl at 
the time of admission to a post-sec-
ondary educational institution," ac-
cording to literature submined by 
Firestone on the financing program. 

The board's Academic Affairs 
Committee also addressed the "need 
to participate in community outreach." 
The committee passed a resolution 
advocating interaction between gradu-
ate students and high school students, 
as well as another endorsing the 
ASUCSO's recent recommendation 
of Marshall College Provost Cecil 
Lytle's proposal for an on-campus 
charter high school. 

Later in the meeting, Kohler ad-
dressed the issue of funding charter-
school programs at other UC cam-
puses. 

"II is essential that the funding for 
such outreach progr.uns won't be com-
ing from any further fee increases," 
Kohler said. "The initiatives for these 
programs need to be pitted against fee 
increases." 

Other board members felt that out-
reach didn't deserve all the attention it 
was getting. 

"Outreach to disadvantaged stu-
dents is important, but it will not be a 
surrogate for affirmative action," 
UCLA Vice President EXlernal and 
UCSA representative John Ou said.

EA OP: Officials 
say program did not 
take stance in strike 

Continued from ..... 1-
district because, by doing so, they 
could "compromise [EAOP's] p0-
sition with the school and the teach-
m," 

"I was advising my assistant di-
rectors here to be careful in their 
dealings with the districts, as there 
are teachers striking out theae, and 
we don't want to be caught in a 
position whereby it may seem that 
we are taking sides," Benitez said. 

"We did not support either side 
[in the teacher's sirike). We have 
been working in the district for 20 
years in reaching junior high and 
high school students," added 
Benitez. 'The last thing we want 
to do is jeopardize our relation-
ship." 

Flowe said that when she came 
into the EAOP office to hand in 
her timesheet last Tuesday, after 
working for two days as a substi-
tute, Rangel told herthal he was in 
"hot water." 

"I told her I felt like I was 
caught in the middle, between 
[Flowe) and the administration 
here at UCSO," Rangel said. 

Aowe said that Rangel appeared 
uneasy during their meeting. 

"When I talked to (Rangel), he 
told me he was very concerned 
that I got the story straight, that he 
didn't tell me to take sick time and 
that he didn't encourage me to 
cross the picket line," Flowe said. 

"He seemed like he was very 
concerned for his own job," she

added. 
It wasduringthis mceting.Aowe 

said, this she was pressured into 
handing in her resignation. 

"[Rangel) said everyone in the 
[EAOP] office was extremely up-
set and that they were having a big 
meeting .... He said he didn't know 
whalto do," Flowe said. 'That's 
when I got the feeling he wanted 
me to resign. He wasn't looking 
me in the eye, and he was very 
nervous." 

Aowe said she offered to resign 
during the meeting only because 
she felt pushed into doing so, and 
that she didn't want to "cause any 
problems" for the program. 

Rangel, however, said that 
Flowe was never forced to resign. 

"She said, 'Well, if you'd like, 
I'll resign.' And I told her hon-
estly, 'Yeah, I would sleep bener, 
it's basically going to resolve the 
situation,'" Rangel said. "[Butl it 
wasn't like I put her in this comer 
to resign." 

Flowe said that she is unsure 
whether she will fi Ie a formal com-
plainl against the EAOP. 

"Being that all oftheir employ-
ees work at the school sites, they 
should have informed us of the 
situation that we were getting our-
selves into just by ,being there and 
working inthecapacityofUCSO," 
Aowe said. 

Founded in 1976, EAOP is an 
effort by the University of Cali-
fornia to prepare underrepresented 
high school students in the state 
for UC admission. EAOPemploys 
between SO and S5 student-coun-
selor aides per year, who regularly 
visit high schools and meet with 
students on a one-to-one basis.

PINION 

The 'Ability To Raise A Child Goes 
Beyond Sexuality 

or some inane reason, 
many people think sexual-
ity is a legitimate indicator 
of parental ability. This 
reasoning implies that a 
homosexual person is an 

unfit role model - a ridiculous assumption, 
because overall character can never be de-
termined based on one trait. 

Yet, due to rampant misconceptions, many 
argue that homosexuals should be barred 
from adopting children. It would be a hor-
rible mistake to accept such a fallacy. If ho-
mosexual applicants are able to provide a 
supportive, beneficial environment for a 

·child, then there is no reason to disqualify 
them from adopting. This country needs to 
give all qualified and committed parents, in-

cluding gay and lesbian couples, the right 
to adopt children. 

Homosexual couples ought to be 
judged on their ability to care, nur-

ture and provide for a child. If such a 
couple can provide a safe and beneficial en-
vironment in which to raise a kid, and if 
the best interest of the child is always the 
paramount goal of adoption agencies and 

the courts, thcn no legitimate argument 
exists for disqualifying a homo-

sexual couple from adopting. 
A person 's sexual orientation

docs not mean he or she cannot be a loving, 
nurturing parent. 

The Child Welfare League suggests that 
"Consideration -[for adoption] should be 
given to ... personality and maturity factors 
and on the ability of the applicant to meet 
the specific needs of the individual child." 
This means if a person is mature, caring and 
fiscally capable of providing for a child, then 
the private sexual activities of that applicant 
are irrelevant to the adoption process. 

Most of the opposition to homosexual 
adoption comes from the religious right. Op-
ponents see gays as a public menace, as 
sexual predators' who push their own agenda 
on people who don't want anything to do with 
it. Furthermore, many argue gays are sexual 
deviants by nature, 
who would com-
mit despicable 
crimes on an 
adopted child 
if given the 
chance. It is 
an interesting 
claim, consid-
ering 90 percent

Adopted Kids 

hen listen-
ing to the 

rantings and 
ravings of mis-

guided liberals 
about the "rights" 

of homosexuals to adopt children. 
there is a strong, though seemingly 
undefinable, feeling that their justifi-
cations arc false. This suspicion arises 
from two significant, but concealed as-
sumptions within their arguments : 
First. homosexuality is an acceptable 
and even natural "alternative" 
lifestyle. Second, the rights of homo-
sexuals to adopt takes precedence over 
the rights and best interests of the 
adopted child. 

Most proponents of homosexual 
adoption affirm that homosexuality is 
an entirely genetic state. unalterable by 
environment or other circumstances. 

This assertion is dubious at best and 
patently false at worst. The consensus 
in the scientific community is that, 
while genetics might be a prevalent 
factor, environment p1ays a significant 
and crucial role in the development of 
a child. In fact, one of the most presti-
gious members of this research com-
munity, evolutionary scientist and au-
thor Stephen Jay Gould, believes that 
environment plays a key role in child-
hood growth and c~ possibly account 
for up to 50 percent of development. 

Consequently, homosexual parents 
could have a direct influence on an 
adopted child's maturation, growth, 
lifestyle and values. These environ-
mental factors could conceivably 
cause a normal 'heterosexual child to 
embrace homosexuality as an accept-
able lifestyle. Allowing an otherwise 
normal and healthy heterosexual child 
to be converted into a homosexual by 
his envirollment - against his con-
scious wi II - is totally reprehensible 
and contrary to basic human rights. 

-The second presuppO'sition made 
by .those supporting gay adoption is 
that the individual homosexual' s 

"right" to adopt takes precedence 
over the rights of the chi Id . 
This premise is completely 
erroneous. The primary pur-
pose of all state adoption 
laws is to ensure the ad-
vancement of the best i 0-
terests of the chi Id and to 
promote the beneficent 
welfare of the child. not to 
cater to the whims or ho-
mosexuals. 

To ensure the primacy 
of the child's welfare 
over all other concerns, 
the couns apply a "best 
interests test." This test 
determines whether the 
would-be adoptive family 

is fit or unfit. [t evaluates 
the lifestyles of the indi-

vidual members anJ how 
slable, safe and beneficiallhe 

home atmosphere is to the child. 
If there is even a shadow of a 

doubt the potential adoptive par-
ents' lifestyle could be damaging

more chaos with the phone lines." 

McKoon added that although he

Lowell doubted that the increased 
demand would lead to gridlock in the

'1t s not a vicious circle because 
with the $10 fee, we are going to be 
able to adequately support a modem

' 'Those for whom a connection

Dubb added that the Internet was 
at least as important as library usage, 
if not more so. 

''This is part of providing an edu-
cation, and there's no more reason for 
having charges for having an e-mail 
accountthan thereis for having charges 
for checking out books at the UCSD 
Libraries," Dubb said. "In both cases, 
this should be a service included in the 
basic payment of student fees." 

However, some students said they 
would rather pay for library usage

Gobbel added. '1fthis is supposed to

the wrong direction." 

Lowell said he hoped the charge

versity should address the modem

"The ideal, long-tenn solution

In accordance wilh the

a modem pool since 1973. The pool

opIion was to con-

dial-in service. 
However. Lowell 
said that the cam-

telephone lines and 
related equipment 
made the second 
option inadvisable.

Lowell Slid 
UCSD cum:ntly has 
no plans 10 establish 
new labs. 

According to 
Lowell, SO percent 
of the campus m0-

pool is funded 
nearly entirely from 
campus network

The plan only affects dial-in m0-
dem users. Use of the campus Mac 
and PC labs would remain free of 
charge. although the question of 
whether dial-in charges would inun-
date the labs with students is one 
which remains unanswered. 

"If they do charge us for outside 
access but not for the use of terminals 

the Iabs," he said. 
Another suggestion was to pr0-

vide a number of free or strictly ti me· 
based modems for people who were 
unwilling or unable 10 pay the $10 
base fee. 

"I would guess that I dial in for a 
total of about one hour per month," 
graduate student Jay Moody said . 
"While it is a nice convenience. I 
think that $ I 0 per month is quite high 
for an hour of usage." 

Lowell said such an arrangement 
would be untenable. 

"We don't believe that·s going to 
work because our past ellperience is 
that people will change their usage

Otherstuderu wereconcemedthaa 
the new policy would not solve any-
thing. as people try to "get their 
money's worth" by using their full 25 
hours. 

"I am outraged that an idea such as 
this could come up," Marshall fresh-
man Kim McKoon said. "If people 
have to pay money, then you can be 
sure that they wi II try to get the most 
use out of their money, causing even 
more chaos wilh the phone lines." 

McKoon added that although he 
normally uses the modem pool during 
off-peak hours. "I will start using the 
peak hours just to get my money's 
worth." 

Lowell doubted that the increased 
demand would lead to grid lock in the 
modem pool. 

''It s not a vicious circle because 
with the $10 fee, we are going to be 
able to adequately support a modem 
pool that can support 25 hours [per 
user) per month," Lowell said. "It 
doesn't matter ifthey use it all."

Many sIudenIS also said they felt 

Internet use was an integral part of 
their educaIion, which their student 
fees should adcqullcly fund. 

"I think thIa allowing students 10 
have access 10 the Inremetand e-mail 
is part of the educational mission of 
the university," ASUCSD President 
Naomi Fallt said. "I think it would be 
more than appropriate to have it housed 
in the [systemwide) educ~tional fee." 

Graduate Student Association 
President Steve Dubb said he agreed 
that the charge went against the 
university 's duty. 

'Thosc foro-whom a connection 
charge is not a big deal wi II get the 
better access and a better education 
than those who can't," Dubb said. 

Dubb added that the Internet was 
at least as important as library usage, 
if not more so. 

'This is part of providing an edu-
cation, and there's no more reason for 
having charges for having an e-mail 
accountthanthereis forhavingcharges 
for checking out books at the UCSD 
Libraries." Dubb said. "In both cases, 
this should bea service included in the 
basic payment of student fees." 

However, some students said they 
would rather pay for library usage 

The UCSD Guardian 

than for IJfanCt access. 
"I would INICh ralherpay SO cents 

evcry time I waUt into the library than 
pay 30 cents pcr houroflntemet usc," 
graduate student Randy Gobbel said. 
"The Internet has become just as im-
ponant as the library for my work, and 
in some WIYS more impoltanl 

"UCSD tries 10 present itself as a 
world-class research university," 
Gobbel added. "If this is supposed to 
be believable, the institution has to 
back it up by providing world-class 
access to basic informational re-
sources. This policy is a giant step in 
the wrong direction ." 

Lowell said he hoped the charge 
would be temporary, and that the uni-
versi ty should address the modem 
issue - and the issue of the Internet 
itself - on a systemwide level. 

' 'The ideal , long-term solution 
would be that this is a part of the 
education program, the charges for 
which are embedded in the larger 
tuition and fee package," he said. "I 
would see this as a bridge to get there."

Falk suggested that, instead oflevy-
ing fees on the students while waiting 
for dial-in fees to become part of the 
tuition package. the modem pool be

From tbe SerwLM to the 
One-Night Stand: What to Do 

t seems there are two schools of 
thought when it comes to the subject of 
Valentine's Day. One group insists the 
holiday is flivolous at be 1, and down-
right depressing at worsL It·s not hard 
to understand thi s point of view : 
Obnoxious PDA (public displays of 

affection). pink and red outfits. and girls showing 
off their roses can be unbearable. 

But because this day happens once a year, it 
only seems fair we follow the advice of the sec-
ond group - "the hopeless romantics." 

Don't be alanned. You don't have to hower 
your loved one with nowers or frilly lingerie to 
enjoy Vaientine's Day. We've compiled a list of 
things to do which doesn' t contain a single rose 
or box of chocolates. Our ideas will make you the 
envy of romantics. while letting you save face 
with the holiday cynics. 
For the SerIous 

After a year or more of dating. you've proba-
bly experienced everything you pol>sibly could 
have with the other person - in the way of San 
Diego restaurants, that is. And instead of going to 
a restaurant you' ve been to a million times, why 
not splurge on a day-long or weekend getaway. 

For lhose who want to spend some time in the 

country. head east to Julian, and spend the night 
at one of the many Victorian bed and breakfast 
inns. Call the Julian Bed and Breakfast Guild for 
more infonnation at 765-1555. 

Campgrounds can also be rcserved for the 
nighl in Julian. The fresh air, beautiful hiking 
paths and famous apple pie will make the hour 
drive well worth Ihe trip . Call the State 
Campground Infonnation number at 1-800-444-
7275 10 reserve a site . 

Of course. if you really want to surprise some-
one. take Ihcm on a cruise. Royal West Tours 
offers one-night boat rides to Ensenada. Call 
Royal West at 595-1695 for more info. 

However, you don' t need to take an overnight 
trip to make somcone's Valentine' s day worth-
while. The thrill (If hot-air ballooning. hang 
gliding or parasailing can ensure this 
Valentine's day will be remembered forever. 
For the Not.so SerIous 

During the firsl few days of dating a new per-
son, keeping up a conversation can be difficult. 
An active date, in which you're too busy to tafk. 
can be the best solution to dating jitters. 

Horseback riding through the Cuyamaca 
Mountains or along the trails of Del Mar is one

alentine' Da 
y stinks. 

1 say that not as a bit-
ter, sing le man who 's 

secretly wailing for some 
unbelievable woman to 

come along and ' make my 
days sunny again. Nor am I a tight-fisted 
scrooge who hates spending beaucoup 
bucks on folded bits of heart-decorated 
paper covered in cheezy Hallmark poetry. 
Nor do r hate going to "quality" restaurants 
which devise "special Valenline 's Day 
menus." featuring everyday entrees com-
plete with "special" Valentine's Day prices. 

1 say this despite those beloved specialty 
items that only appear around this time of 
year. Nothing says "I love you" better than 
dark chocolates with love-cream centers. 
melt-in-your-mouth lingerie and - cvery-
onc's favorite - condoms decorated with 
glow-in-the-dark hearts. 

I say this despite the holiday'S namesake. 
a saint whom the Romans martyred during 
the Christian persecutions of the third centu-
ry. A man who has become lost amid the 
sappy commercialism which has taken over 
the day named after him. 

What is it about Feb. 14 that I hate so 
much? I'll tell you what: It·s the way people 
behave on this day that really bothers me. 
People get entirely too slrcssed over what is 
essentially. let's face it, a dumb holiday. 

The boyfriend worrics that the lingeric 
he bought his girlfriend is too small. while 
the gi rlfricnd frets that the condoms with the 
glowing hearts she bought for her boyfricnd 
are too large. Both wOIT)' that the romantic 
evening. which they have been waiting all 
year for. won' l be as romantic as il ought 10 
be. 

Then there are those romantic-minded 
individuals who have nobody. Thc would-
be boyfriend spends a whole hour writing a 
heart-felt love poem for a girf - complete 
with a homemade valentine made of card-
board and hundreds of candy hearts - cvcn 
though she thinks he's a creep and wants 
him to just go away. 

A would-be girlfriend. unable to say a 
word to the guy of her dreams. writes sui-
cide poelIy and withdraws from society. She 
decides life isn ' t worth hving unless this 
particular man realizes shc's thc one for 
him. 

Then there are those poor victims of the 
would-be lovers - those who have to deal 
with the fervent boy and deathly-silent. sui-
cidal girfs. 

Undoubtedly. Valcntinc 's Day is the 
worst for those newly single due to a break-

Singledom Can Be a Liberating 
Experience on Valentine d Day 

alentine's 
Day is for the 

birds. 
Well, that was 

the original intent 
anyways. According 

to the Penguin 
Dictionary of Saints, Valentine's 
Day arose from the "old idea that 
birds began to pair on that date." 

What's more, a person by the 
name of "SI. Valentine" never 
actually existed. Actually , the 
Encyclopedia Britannica states that 
there were two men by the name 
of Valentine, and both were mar-
tyred in Rome during the third 
century. 

The day of I'amour is fast 
approaching, and the signs are 
rampant and visible. The number 
of couples is climbing. Everyone is 
smiling a little bit more; the skies 
are blue and the sun is shining. 

That is not the case for the great 
majority of us who will be alone, 
either as the result of rejection or 
by choice (there's nothing wrong 
with that - singledom can be a 
liberating choice, mind you). 

For loners out there on the day 
for lovers, the Guardian, in its cir-
cumspect wisdom, has compiled a 
list of things to do on Feb. 14. 

If you are really depressed 
about lIot having a Valentine -
either because all your friends arc 
paired-up, or because you have a 
Don Juan image to uphold - then: 

o Show all the sy mptoms of 
having a significant other. Smile a 
lot. Glaze your eyes with a dreamy 
look. Walk slowly . Sniff flowers . 
Act preoccupied. When people ask 
YOlJ something, say "Hmm?" and 
"Huh?" frequently. Make it obvi-
ous you have your mind on some-
thing, or someone, else. 

o Wear red every day. It acts as 
a visible sign that you fully back 
the national day of love, and there-
fore you certainly must have your 
own valentine to share it with. 

o The classic: Send /lowers and 
chocolate to yourself, along with a 
note from a so-called "secret 
admi rer." Heck, go all out and 
write yourself a poem. Only you 
know what you really like. Treat 
yourself fo stuff you know you 
deserve. 

If you are practical, and hold a 
healthy view of Valentine's Day, 
then: 

o StUdy. Finals will rear their 
nasty heads in the not-so-distant 
future. This is UCSD, after all, and 
the quarter system doesn't slow 
down so people can enjoy a little 
thing like Valentine's Day. 

o Go out with a group of people 
you know and reminisce about 
fai led relationships of the past. 
Who neeils a boyfriend/girlfriend 
when you've got greal friends? 

o Remember those little 
Valentine ' s Day cards from ele-
me."tary school? You used to give 

them to everyone, regardless of 
gender, but the biggest one was 
always reserved for that special 
someone in the class. Well, buy a 
bag of candy conversation hearts 
and fill out those cards again. 

o Watch Bed of Roses with your 
friends . If you can't experience the 
ideal, cornball relationship, you 
can at least witness it second-hand 
at the movies. 

• "Vale-wha? What's that?" 
Just remember that not every-

one has a valentine. In fact, most 
people are ingle. So take heart -
next year you may have somebody 
special to be your valentine. Still, if 
you are bitter and want to mope, 
then: 

o Rent a movie li sted on the 
Guardian's "Love-Iy Films." 

o Fish one of those photos of 
your ex out of the garbage and 
throw darts at it. . 

o Dress in black, bum incense, 
and eat noodles. 

o Get on with your life! It 's only 
one day out of 100s. Don ' t get 
eaught up in the hype. 

Nevertheless, you're still bitter, 
but now you want to numb the 
pain: 

o Rent one of the movies listed 
on the Guardian's list of ."If You 
Hate Your Date" movies. 

And if you could care less 
about Valentine'S Day, well, 
you're probably not even reading 
this anyway.

The UCSD Guardian 

COUPLES: Fun 
things to do for two 
ContInued from Pac- 9 
way to enjoy the outdoors with a 
loved one, while letting the anim.J 
do all the work. (And we're not talk-
ing about your date.) 

If jaunting around on an animal 
is not for you, try sitting in a little 
cart behind one. The carriage rides 
downtown offer an excellent oppor-
tunity to relax, sit back and watch 
the scenery of the downtown harbor. 
Call Cinderella Carriage Co. for 
more details at 239-8080. 

On a date with a nature- lover, 
wh!lle watching could get you off 
to the perfect stan. Going on one of 
the many San Diego Bay dinner 
cruises could be the perl'ect ending. 
In any case, trying any of the ahove 
"active" date ideas will create plenty 
of convcrallon. 
For the On&-N'~t Stand 

For thi~ type or d::lc. u day-long 

STINKS: V-Day 
is far too tressful 
Continued from page 9 
up. The ex-boyfnend hate lire. and is 
reduced LO searching for any bimbo 10 
come and .olve his problem . The ex-
girlfriend, terrified by the idea of not 
having a valentine, sets up a dale wilh 
a total loser and has th e worst 
Valentine's Day of her life. 

Then the people like me - people 
who must interact with all of these 
unhappy, disenfranchised individuals 
- end up having a crappy day, too. 

Every five minutes, the nervous 
boyfriend asks me for advice on how 
to liven up the candle-lit dinner, while 

adventure or a weekend get-away is 
a little over-tile-top. A long dinner 
with ample wine will do the trick. 

Considering the restaurant choic-
es near campus, it's a wise decision 
to head beyond La Jolla Village 
Square for a romantic dinner. After 
all, the fluorescent lighting at 
California Pizza Kitchen is no sub-
stitute for candlelight - and 
Islands' tacky tiki decor is hardly an 
intimate surrounding. 

Drive south at 5: 15 p.m. and 
watch the sunset from the Coronado 
Bridge as you head for Peohe's, a 
Hawaiian restaurant famous for its 
food and its elegant decor. A walk 
on the boardwalk next to Peohe's is 
a perfect way to enjoy the view of 
the San Diego skyline. Peohe's is far 
from cheap. If you go all out, as is 
po ible on Valentine' s Day, you 
can run the bill up to $100 for two. 

Another striking view can he

The embillcrcd cx-Ixlyfricnd di~­
mantles me wilh sharp, willy put-
downs to help vent his frustrations. 
Meanwhile, the ex-girlfriend peppers 
me with questions on how to gently 
dump the annoying guy on 
Valentine's Day after he' given her 
$100 earri ngs. 

1l1C would-be boyfriend, excited 
that he has finally declared his love, 
waits eagr.rly for the inevitable call 
from the object of his affeclions. 
Only the call will be one of those "I 
just want to be friends" peeches. 
Would-be girlfriend sits si lent.ly in the

FEATURES 13 

but if you aim to impress, this is the 
place for you. The view of the city at 
night will take your date's breath 
away, and the cuisine is superl>. 

If Peohe's and Mister A's sound 
a little too overwhelming for the first 
date, Trattoria Acqua and 
George's at the Terrace - both 
located in downtown La Jolla -
offer somewhat more casual dining. 

Arrive at George's early. 
Reservations can't be made and the 
wait can be 40 minutes. Make sure 
to wear something warm, because 
you'll sit on the terrace, enjoying the 
sunset and stars - and the cheaper 
prices. The shark sa]ad is to die for. 

Though Tratorria Acqua does 
have beautiful ocean views, its inte-
rior design is what makes this 
restaurant a sight to sec. 
HaphaLardly divided into .several 
sections, this quaint eatery seems 
like a ramhling old Tuscan house. 
Remember to order an Italian wine 
- it 's the best part of thl\ amBLing 
experience. 

~he ponders death, only hccause of 
Valentine's Day 

The victim~ of the wlluld-be 
lover> are irritable, not only because 
they are fending off unwanted 
advances. but also becau~e the) are 
dealing with their own l'Omplex love 
problems on this holjday for lovers. 

The point is, Valentine's Day docs 
not discriminate. Whet~er you're sin-
gle or seeing someone, whether you 
have no valentine or 100, whether 
you care about this rno 't inanc of hol-
idays or not, chance, are you'll have a 
crappy day. Everyone will. 

Just make sure that you mai I your 
grievances to Hallmark. rather than 
lay them on me. 

Whether it's for some extreme Colorado 
skiing/snowboarding, or a Colorado Party 
Maximus, let Western Padfic be your ticket 

to a well-deserved Spring Break - at a

RESIGN: 
Players say coach 
was under pressure 

ContI ....... from pee- 1 
sign. 

"We don't know exactly whal 
happened in that meeting. Whal 
we have been told by Judy Sweet 
is that [Dannevik] officially, to 
his credit, resigned from Ihe po-
si lion ," one player said. "[We 
feel] he chose to resign as op-
posed to making some specific 
changes that we Ihought would 
make improvements in the pro-
gram." 

The majority of players ' com-
plaints about their ex-coach con-
cerned inconsistencies in his poli -
cies. 

"He was v~ry personal and 
emotional , rather than objeclive 
and professional," a player said. 
" It was well known if he didn't 

--

like someone, [he would keep 
them on the bench even though 
they] should have been on the 
coun." 

''To his credit, Ilhink that he 
was trying to get the best out of 
everybody, but the inconsisten-
cies in his policy and the way he 
treated people really manifesled 
ilself in some players becoming 
worse and other players becom-
ing beuer," anolher player said. 

Dannevik was unavailable for 
comment. 

Sweel would not confirm 
whether she met wilh team mem-
bers about Dannevik, sayi ng only 
that she "[meets) with all the 
teams [shel supervi es," and thai 
it's "pa rt of [th e athletic 
department's] standard proce-
dure." 

"II'S nOI uncommon Ihat there 
arc things Ihat student-athletes 
would like to ee done differ-
ently," Sweet added. "A ll 1 can 
say is that Doug resigned of his 

11Ie UCSD Ouudiu 

own lCCord for the reasons that 
he aniculated - that he wu in-
terested in conecntratinl on the 
men's team and pursuing other 
interests, both professional and 
penonal." 

The players, however, felt that 
repeated connicts between the 
leam and Dannevik may have had 
more to do with his departure. 

''This wasn't the firsltime that 
[players] have put up a strong 
complainl about hi m," one player 
said. "II has been an ongoing 
Ihing." 

"Obviously , there 's always a 
backstage to everything, and it 
wasn't just Doug Dannevik de-
ciding that he wanled a new ca-
reer in golfing or a new family," 
one player explained. 

"I admi re and respect 
[Dannevik) for stepping down. 
Our focus now i just to gel the 
kind of coach we thought we 
should have had all along," she 
added.

UCSD Lets it Slip at La Verne 
MISTAKEI: The Tritons made crucial errors at the wrong time, wasting a 
good offensive effort and losing both games of a twin bill at La Verne 
., ... 1 ....... 
Auoc/.re $poftl EdItor 

In baseball, you've done a 
pretty good job if you score six 
runs and 10 runs in the two games 

of a double-header. 
You figure to win 
at least one game, 
right? 

Wrong. 
Coming off a 

successful show-
i ng at the Fi rst 
Pitch Classic Tour-

namenl two weeks ago, UCSD 
was looking to take on rival La 
Verne University on their home 
turf, but the Tritons came up 
empty, losing both games of a 
twinbill, 8-6 and 11- 10 on Satur-
day. 

UCSDdropped to 2-3-1 on the 
season, having gone down in de-

cluding two by freshman left-
fielder John Goldsmith and three 
by fellow freshman Chris 
Rondestvedt . BUI it wasn'l 
enough, u the Leopards ran out 
to a quick, 5-0 lead in the second 
inning. 

''They were swinging their bats 
very well," Triton Head Coach 
Robert Fletcher said. "We played 
well offensi vely, but we shot our-
selves in the foot." 

The nightcap was a different 
story, however, as the Tritons 
jumped out to get a quick start. 

Senior southpaw Mike Bryant 
shut down lhe Leopard offense with 
five-plus innings of work, and the 
Tritons' "Louisville's" went to 
work, knocking in seven runs in 
the first six innings of play. 

UCSD's surging offense was 
led by a couple of seniors. First-

runs, while third-baseman Carl 
Abramson also chipped in with a 
single, double and a couple of 
RBI. 

The Tritons led 7-2 going into 
the sixth. Fletcher went to his 
bullpen, bringing in junior righl-
handed relief pitcher Theo Rob-
ins, followed by Andy DeGrasse. 

The Tritons were looking 10 
stop a lite Leopard comeback, 
but La Verne capitalized on its 
opportunity and notched three 
more runs in Ihe sixth and sev-
enth innings to narrow the gap to 
8-7. 

UCSD increased its slim lead 
with Iwo more runs in the ninth to 
take a 10-7 lead inlO the ninth 
inning, but DeGrasse ran oul of 
steam in the ninth, as the leop-
ards scored four runs to take the 
victory, 11 -10.

"Righi when we needed 10

some critical errors." 

"We [the coaching staff] 
are still confident thaI we're 
capable of winning, bUI we 
have to step it up a bit," he 
added. "We've got a good 
ballclub; it' s just that some 

Crucial errors in key 
moments plagued the Tri-
tons in the first game of 
the double-header. Marc 
Abrams took the loss, but 
three errors led way to 
three unearned run s, 
which proved to be the 
margin of victory. 

UCSD collected 10 hits, in-
baseman Craig Birk had three hits, 
including a triple, and scored three

step up."

18 SPORTS The UCSD Guardian Monday. February 12. 1996 

1Iitons Deliver Bay Area .Blues PAIR: UCSD 
wins frrst two of year 

lineup looked I bit different, miss-
ing number-two Kurokawa due to 
grad-school testing. 

TWO FOR TWO: UCSD won a pair of games on 
the road this weekend against Menlo and UCSC 
By M .. St.nce 
Staff Writer 

Did he call "glass?" 
Trailing late in the second half 

Friday night against Menlo College. 
Triton freshman for-
ward Mike Thimgan 
banked in a three-
point basket which 
may have turned the 
tide for the UCSD 
men' s basketball 
team (10-12). 

Thimgan 's three 
came during a 22-4 scoring run, 
which powered the Trilons to a 69-
65 viclory over Menlo College. The 
win compleled a three-game season 
sweep of Ihe Oaks. 
. "Thimgan came down and 
banked in a huge Ihrec poinler," 
Triton forward Mike Wall said. " I 
Ihink Ihal was Ihe lurning poi nt right 
there. /t took the wind out of their 
sails." 

UCSD followed its come-from-
behind victory on Friday night with 
a clutch, down-to-the-wire win ovcr 
a scrappy UC Santa Cruz team on 
Saturday night, 83-82. 

UCSC, the perrenial doormat of 
the UC athletic system, proved that 
il is-working hard to pUllogether a 
good basketball squad up there in 
Ihe redwoods. . 

"They ate much improved over 
the teams they've had in the pas .. " 
Triton Head Coach Greg Lanihiersaid 
ofUCSC. "They were a little hungrier 
than we were." 

One Ihing Ihat the Banana Slugs 
couldn'l counler, however, was Ihe 
dominaling fronl -court play of Tri-
Ion center Mall Aune. The6'8" jun-
ior scored a game-high 29 poinls, as 
UCSD looked 10 exploillhe Banana 
Slugs' lack of height. 

"They don'l have any size," 

JUMP: Barry 
makes like a rabbit 
ContInued from pag. 20 

. Everything worked to perfection. 
Barry urprised he world, as he 
louk off from the free-Ihrow line, 

~.' 

Lanlhier said. ''They just couldn't 
conlain Matt inside." 

Santa Cruz did manage 10 keep 
the game close, however; as the Iwo 
leams bauled il oul during the IWO 
halves of frenzied, see-saw basket-
ball. 

" II was a back-and-forth game," 
Lanlhier said. 'The most we were 
up by was five, bul we didn'l trail 
the last five or six minules of the 
game." 

Aune also came up big for UCSD 
at Ihe foul line. The Trilon work-
horse hit four slraight free throws 
down the stretch to lift UCSD to 
viclory. 

Whil!; Ihe Tritons were not com-
plctely pleased with their play on 
Saturday night, lhey felt fortunate 10 
come away from the road lrip with 
two solid wins. 

"We had some turnovers," Wall 
said. "/t was a very sloppy game. 
They were just scrappy allover the

prepared for it. We were lucky 10 
come away with a win." 

"We played well enough to win," 
Lanthier added. "And you need to 
learn how to win when you have an 
off night. Those are two things you 
can'lleach. We did both on the road." 

While the Tritons did show heart 
and determination in Iheir efforts 
lale in close games this weekend, 
Lanthier is cautious nolto label his 
squad's performance as a major step 
for the learn. 

"You don't judge big sleps at the 
momenl," he said. "You judge big 
sleps when you look back. Ilhink it 
was a good time for them. They got

in an early season loumament game 
against Menlo, UCSD exploded to 
blow out the Oaks by more than 50 
points al RIMAC in January. 

'Their intensity was at a much 
higher level than when we played 
them in San Diego," Wall said. 

Menlo was ahead 61-47 wilh 10 
minutes left in the game and only 
scored four points the rest of the way. 

'They took a big lead," Wall 
said. "Bul we took a timeout, got the 
troops together and put together a

Aune led the Trilons in scoring 
and rebounding, pouring in 19 points 
and pulling down seven boards.

In aday when a white NBA player 

is supposed to win only the thrce-

"We're kind of just using this 
malCh as a tune up for Pornona." 
La Plante said. 

'This was I good warm-up to 
get us focused and used to playing 
people other than our teammates," 
Huberman said. "We're coming 
togelher and starting to play stron-
ger." 

The Tritons met the challenge 
Salurday, defeating Pomona 6-3 
for their second- straight win. 

'Their team was the same as it 
was lasl year," La Plante said. 
"Everyone had to play well for us

Malephanpakul played num-
ber-one singles and doubles, once

the first set of her singles outing, 
but lost the tie-breaker and even-

for a foul on both occasions. 

'The way they called the fouls 
was a little slrange," Malone said. 

There was nothing strange 
aboullhe Triton viclory over The 
Master's on Friday night, though. 
It was a Iypically sound, all-around 
performance by the UCSD squad, 
which ended in a 65-58 triumph 
and the team's 15th win . 

After taking a 43-33 lead into 
Ihe locker room at halflime, the 
Trilons were challenged down the 
stretch by Ihe Master's squad. 

" We really had to work hard 10 
pu II oUllhe wi n against Master's," 
Malone said . "They have im-
proved a lot." 

The Tritons' outside allack was 
paced by guard Cindy Yamasaki, 
whose final stal line included 20 
poi nls, four of nine shooting from 

Thus, Somers and Hoecker 
teamed up at number-two doubles, 
while Huberman and freshman KaaJa 
Potashniclt grabbed the third spot. 

Both doubles teams posted wins 
forthe Tritons. defeating theiroppo-
nents, 8-3 and 8-5, respectively. 
Somers filledthenumber-two singles 
position supetbly, claiming the win, 
6-1 , 6-3. Likewise, Huberman's 6-
I, 7-5 victory was in keeping with 
her impressive levels of play. 

Hoecker had a lough match at 
number five. She took Ihe first set 
easily, 6-1, lost the second set in 
the tie breaker, 6-7, but came back 
to win the malch, 6-3, in the third. 

Trilon newcomer POlashnick 
slarted slow, relinquishing the first 
set, 3-6. She came back to win the 
second set, 6-4, but finally losl the 
match, 5-7, in the third . 

The Triton women showcased 
their ability last weekend and have 
hopes of greal success this season. 

" We're returning four of our 
starters from last year," Huberman 
said. "Ilhink that when things get 
a little bi t tighler and more com-
petitive, our experience will help 
us get through."

- to make up for her seven ium-
overs. UCSD's offensive efforts 
inside the paint were spearheaded, 
as usual, by Jungwirth , who 
notched 12 points and 16 rebounds. 
Junior Anne Westmoreland con-
tributed eighl poinls from her for-
ward position as well . 

With the weekend splil, the 
Tritons' record stands al 15-6, a 
solid mark to be sure, but one Ihat 
does not guarantee Ihem a slot in 
the playoff picture. 

"We took the loss [10 La 
Verne] hard because we knew 
we needed to win the. rest of our 
games," Malone said. "But the 
girls are fired up, and we're go-
ing to work hard. We've gOl to 
bounce back." 

UCSD has Ihree remaining 
games, which it needs to win in 
order to maintain its hold on the 
sixth, and final, playoff spot in the 
Western Region . The Tritons will 
begin their stretch run on Tuesday 
night at RIMAC against Christian 
Heritage.

THE CYNIC 
SEAN RAHIMI 

Yes, White Men 
CAN Jump 

It was meant to be. Ever 
since the infamous movie 
White Men Can't Jump, the 
white race has been campaign-
ing to prove that white men 

Tritons Smash 'Dogs, Sagehens 
SWINGING AWAY: UCSD earned its first two victories of the season against Pitzer and Redlands 

can jump. 
The Caucasian Lords Of 

Vertical Efficiency Respectabil-
ity (CLOVER) got together in 
the heavens and sent down 
candidates in hopes of reaching 
their goal of showing earthlings 
that a vertical leap could be 
possessed by a man of white 
skin. The African-American 
Lords And Airmen (AALAA) 
would have none of this, 
however. Every time the 
CLOVER sent down a chal-
lenger, the AALAA responded 
with proven athletes to destroy 
the feeble challenges. 

The first CLOVER attempt 
at vertical worthiness came in 
the late 1980's in the form of 
Tom Chambers. An All-Star 
MVP and a prolific scorer, he 
was never able to break into 
the slam-dunk competition 
semi final s, let alone compete 
for the coveted award. The 
CLOVER trjed once more in 
the early 1990's, entering Rex 
Chapman - a slashing 
forward with suppo ed "hops." 
However, Rex "the wonder 
dog" Chapman new more like 
a collie than a rabbit. 

Third time' s the charm, 
though. After much experimen-
tation, the CLOVER created a 
young, trash-talking, bony-
looking, pale-skinned, tall 
lanky guard who could throw it 
down. The result: NBA legend 
Rick Barry 's son, Brent Barry 
of tt\le Clippers. Never mind 
that the elder Barry was a great 
shooter, not a high-flying 
dunker. 

The CLOVER wanted lheir 
prodigy to possess some sort of 
skin besides dunking. This 
way, if he didn ' t win in his 
first couple of years, he could 
stay in the league for awhile 
and try again at a later time. 
With his skills - genetically 
inherited from his father - he 
would last in the NBA. 

Furthermore, this strategy 
worked because the AALAA 
never suspected that Rick 
Barry's son could jump. I 
mean, come on ... the Barry 
kids (three of them) are known 
primarily as great shooters like 
their father. Consequently. the 
AALAA did not send any good 
leapers to the 1996 contest. In

Having suffered a tough season-opening loss 
to Division I opponent Long Beach State, the 
UCSD women's tennis team regained its cham-

pionship form, convincingly de-
feating two Division 111 squads 
last week. 

To begin the weekend, the 
Tritons crushed the Bulldogs 
from the Univcr ity of Redlands 
on Friday, 7-2 at the Northview 
courts. 

Redlands, a program which 
has never posed a threat to the Tritons, show-
cased a new player at the number-one position. 
The first-seeded Bulldog claimed the only victo-
ries for Redlands, winning both her singles and 
doubles outings. The Triton team of Miki 
Kurokawa and Yumi Takemoto failed to per-
form up to the level of their competition, losing 
their match, 8-1. 

"They just never could get the momentum 
going.:' Triton Head Coach Liz LaPlante said. "It 
was an unfortunate loss. We're just writing it off 
as a bad match." 

Michelle Malephanpakul, who occupies the 
. number-one singles position for the Tritons, was 

also defeated by the Bulldogs' top player, 6-2, 6-
3 .~The rest of Redlands ' lineup, however, was no 
contest for the depth and experience of the Tri-
tons. UCSD's second- and third-seeded doubles 
teams played well, defeating their opponents 8-
2 and 8-1, respectively. 

Kurokawa recovered from her disappointing 
double outing, taking the win at the number-two 
si ngles po ition, 6-2, 6-1.

just gets every ball back, moves the ball around, 
and comes in when she's supposed to," LaPlante 
said. "She's really got an all-around game." 

Takemoto struggled early in her singles match 
at the fourth spot, but came back to claim the 
match, 7-6, 6-3. Susan Huberman won big at 
number five, utilizing her overpowering serve to 
crush her Redlands opponent, 6-0, 6-1 . 

Number-three Hilary Somers and number-
six Annie Hoecker also posted victories for the 
Tritons, defeating their opponents 6-1, 6-3 and 
6-3,6-0. respectively. Coach La Plante and Tri-
ton team members were pleased with Friday's 
performance, but knew that Saturday's contest

Tritons Earn Weekend Split 
ONE UP, ONE DOWN: UCSD took a win over The Master's on 
Friday, but lost on the road against La Verne on Saturday night 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

With five losses in the books going into Satur-
day night's contest against La Verne. the UCSD 
women's basketball team neededjust a few victo-
ries to secure a spot in the playoffs. 

The Leopards were not accommodating 
hosts, however. as the La Verne squad did 
unto the Tritons what UCSD had become 
accustomed to doing to its foes: winning 
the match with late-game heroics. 

It was the Leopards' Tiffany Hall who 
made the difference in this game, when, 
with just over a minute to play, she made 
her only shot of the contest - a three-pointer-
and was fouled . Hall sunk the free throw to put La 
Verne up by one, a lead it would not relinquish 
during the closing seconds. 

"We made some mistakes at the end [of the 
game] that really cost us," UCSD Head Coach 
Judy Malone said. 'That foul [on Hall] was criti-
cal." 

The Tritons led at the half by a slim 37-35 

margin, as UCSD' s leading scorer, forward Karli 
Jungwirth, tallied most of her 15 points in the 
opening stanza. In the second half, however, the 
Leopards switched to a zone defense, slowing 
Jungwirth's scoring pace and forcing UCSD to 

depend on its outside shooters for of-
fense. But the Triton sharp-shooters did 
not come through, and La Verne rallied to 
take the 66-63 victory. 

"We had a tough game [on Friday 
night] against The Master's, and I think 
everybody was just a little tired," Malone 
explained. "We just didn 't have the legs 
to shoot at the end [against La Verne]." 

Among the obstacles UCSD faced in their 
contest with the Leopards were some question-
able calls. La Verne benefited from 23 trips to the 
charity line. while the Tritons visited only twice 
in the entire game. Particularly troublesome to 
Malone was a crucial pair of blocking fouls 
called on UCSD's Sarah Schneider late in the 
game, when Schneider was "not moving and
