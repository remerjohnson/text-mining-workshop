Dining-Dollar 
Exchange to 
Begin in May

By Ayelet Bitton
Associate News Editor

Early next month, students will be able to sell any 
excess dining dollars to their peers as part of a new 
program erected last week by the Housing, Dining 
and Hospitality Department.

At an April 23 meeting, the Housing and Dining 
committee voted to approve the exchange program, 
which will allow students to transfer any desired 
number of dining dollars from one student account to 

another for a self-selected price. 
From May 3 to June 6, students 
will be able to pick up a form 
from the Hospitality Services 
building to request such a trans-
action.

According to HDC 
Committee member and 
A.S. President-elect Wafa Ben 
Hassine, the program is aimed at 
students who may not be able to 
use up their dining dollars at the 
end of the year. Currently, 74.1 
percent of students living in the 
residence halls have used fewer 
of their dining dollars than the 
HDC budget schedule recom-
mends, while only 10.3 percent 
have used more.

“It is a good idea because a 
lot of students end up leaving the 
year with a lot of dining dollars 
left on their plan, and there is 
no form of reimbursement,” Ben 
Hassine said. “It’s a good route.”

Sixth College committee rep-
resentative Parminder Sandhu said students will be 
able to sell their dining dollars for any price agreed 
upon by the two parties involved. 

“All HDH does is move the dining dollars,” he said. 

Program will allow students to 
unload leftover meal points.

An A.S. resolution demanding that 
the university stop working with com-
panies associated with human-rights 
violations has come under fire from 
members of the pro-Israel campus 
community. 

The resolution was drafted by 
members of several campus organi-
zations — including Students for 
Justice in Palestine and the Student 
Sustainability Collective —  and 
approved by Transfer Senator Adam 
Powers and Campuswide Senator 
Desiree Prevo. According to Associate 
Vice President of Enterprise Operations 
Rishi Ghosh — a co-sponsor of the res-
olution — the council was inspired by a 
similar effort at UC Berkeley, where the 
resolution passed 16-4 in the student 
Senate, but was eventually vetoed by 
Berkeley A.S. President Will Smelko.

The resolution calls for the UC sys-

tem to stop investing in companies 
such as General Electric and United 
Technologies, which supporters of the 
resolution claim promote violence by 
providing technology — such as heli-
copters and aircraft engines — to war-
ring countries around the world. 

Sixth College senior Leena Barakat 
— who helped draft the resolution 
— said the UCSD version was altered 
to ensure that it condemned human-
rights violations as a whole, and not 
specifically actions taken by the state 
of Israel. According to Barakat, it is the 
second such resolution to be proposed 
at an American university, the first 

being at Berkeley.
“We really tried to make the bill 

more universal and clarify that to 
uphold the ideals of corporate social 
responsibility, we should divest from 
U.S. companies that are benefitting 
from occupancies elsewhere,” Barakat 
said. “The bill is really watered down 
from the one at Berkeley, which directly 
targeted Israel — but we mention other 
areas such as Iran and Morocco. It is 
not anti-Israel.”

She acknowledged that any official 
change in the university’s investment 
procedures would have to be decid-
ed by the UC Board of Regents, but 

said that similar resolutions have been 
influential in the past. She referred 
specifically to an instance when Nelson 
Mandela identified the university’s 
divestment from South Africa as an 
important factor in ending the apart-
heid reign in that country.

“Of course, the actual decision will 
go to the regents, but it is a call to divest 
to show that we are listening and we 
understand,” Barakat said. 

A.S. Engineering Senator Adi Singer 
— a member of the pro-Israel commu-
nity and creator of the Facebook group 

Proponents say the 
measure is meant to 
condemn human-rights 
violations worldwide.

Event planner attributes rapid sale of guest tickets — which dried up 
three weeks earlier than expected — to hype over musical lineup.
By Hayley Bisceglia-Martin
News Editor

This was a bad year to put off buying Sun God tickets for your friends. By April 22, all 3,500 tickets for the festival had been sold — just two and a half weeks after 
they went on sale. 

Like last year, the tickets could be purchased 
starting April 5 for $41 each. In order to curb the 
number of non-students attending the festival, A.S. 
Concerts & Events maintained the policy that guest 
tickets must be purchased by a UCSD student or 
employee, with a limit of two tickets per person.

A small number of alumni tickets — included in 
a $55 package that offers dinner on RIMAC Field 

— are still available on www.alumni.ucsd.edu. While 
students and faculty buy guest tickets from a pool of 
3,200, the Alumni Association normally sets aside 
300 tickets for its members.

Last year, guest tickets didn’t sell out until the 
week of the festival. Associate Vice President of 
Concerts & Events Alex Bramwell attributes this 
year’s speedy sell-out to increased off-campus hype 
about the artists performing at this year’s festival 
— including Drake, Michelle Branch, B.o.B. and 
DJ Z-Trip.

“We have the same number, we have the same 
policy as last year — I guess it was just more excite-
ment about the lineup,” Bramwell said.

“It’s up to the students to determine the 
details: whether they will give them 
away for free or if one will pay the 
other.”

This will be the first time the 
option to swap dining dollars has been 
available. At the end of the quarter, the 
HDH administration will review the 
program’s success and submit a report 
on possible improvements.

“Depending on that [report], we 
might alter the program to become 
more efficient,” Ben Hassine said. 

She said changes include moving the 
transaction requests online or allowing 
students to report to HDH how many 
dining dollars they are looking to sell 
or buy — which would allow HDH to 
match up students for a purchase.

“There are a lot of options avail-
able, but at this point, the trial run just 

consists of two people coming in and 
signing the form for the transaction,” 
Ben Hassine said.

She added, however, that the com-
mittee is concerned the program may 
have unintended negative results, such 
as students pressuring each other into 
selling their dining dollars.

“The way the pilot program will 
work initially is two parties will have to 
go in person to HDH office,” Sandhu 
said. “Both parties would have to sign 
the form and there will be some form, 
of a brief screening with someone from 
HDH to make sure both students are 
willing to participate.”

Committee members have also 
expressed concern that cash-strapped 
students may sell their dining dollars 
as a form of income, and consequently 
eat an insufficient amount. To prevent 
this, HDH plans to focus its advertis-

ing for the program in markets such as 
Roger’s Place, targeting students who 
do not use meal points as their primary 
food source.

“We’ve decided not to do the mar-
keting in dining halls, just in the mar-
ketplaces such as Earl’s and Goody’s,” 
Ben Hassine said. “That way it’s more 
targeted marketing.”

While the program will provide stu-
dents with more control, Muir College 
sophomore Stephanie Fairbairn said 
she is concerned that the plan does not 
solve the main problem: students being 
forced to purchase too many dining 
dollars to begin with — especially in 
light of the recent increase to manda-
tory dining dollars, approved by the 
same committee on March 12.

“It sounds like a good idea if some-
one needs more dining dollar and oth-
ers are willing to share or want to get 

reimbursed,” Fairbairn, who currently 
has 200 dining dollars over the targeted 
amount, said. “It would still be better, 
though, if there was a choice of plans at 
the beginning of the year when students 
buy their dining dollars, so you don’t get 
stuck in this situation to begin with.”

Still, the swap option is an improve-
ment, said Marshall College freshman 
Kirche Ray. 

“It’s definitely a good idea for stu-
dents to be able to sell them,” Ray 
said. “That way, at the end of the year, 
people won’t have to buy unnecessary 
toasters and items just to try to get 
their money’s worth.”

HDH Director Mark Cunningham 
did not respond to requests for an 
interview.

A.S. President Utsav Gupta was 
among those left without a ticket, 
having been taken by surprise when 
they sold out so quickly.

“They sold out three weeks faster 
than last year, so it was pretty unex-
pected,” Gupta said. “It’s a good sign 
for the event — I think people are 
excited about Sun God this year. The 
A.S. president couldn’t even get a 
[guest] ticket to Sun God.”

After guest tickets ran out unex-
pectedly on April 22, many students 
and nonstudents began to solicit 
tickets online, through sites like 
Facebook and Craigslist. Among the 
reimbursements offered on these 
sites are cash, alcohol and a place 

to crash on the day of the concert. 
Scalpers have already begun posting 
their extra tickets with prices as high 
as $90.

According to Bramwell, tracking 
down scalpers by tracing back tickets 
to their student ID numbers would 
be an impractical course of action for 
the UC Police Department, given the 
manpower and time required to track 
down individual offenders. 

“It’s a tricky situation,” Bramwell 
said. “So, the best thing we are going 
to be doing is drafting cease-and-
desist type ordinances on behalf of 
the university, and contacting scalp-
ers individually  — telling them, 
essentially, to take their posting 
down.”

Bramwell said that additional 
guest tickets might be made available 
on May 10, just before the festival.

“There’s a very small chance that 
a very small number may be on sale 
on May 10 — but it’s very unlikely at 
this point, and I don’t think it’s going 
to happen, personally,” Bramwell said. 
“It’s better to give the warning that 
‘Well, there’s a slight chance that it 
might happen, but don’t get your 
hopes up.’ Don’t plan on it.”

Those who do have guest tickets 
will have to trade them for wristbands 
on Thursday, May 13 or on the day of 
the festival in order to be admitted.

“Students Against ASUCSD Anti-Israel 
Bias and Resolutions” — said the reso-
lution is a pointed attack against Israel. 

“It’s a very thinly veiled political 
statement,” Singer said. “If it’s about all 
human-rights violations, why are there 
a ton of citings specifically 
about Gaza and very few 
about anywhere else?”

Although Ghosh said 
the resolution has received 
endorsements from 
groups such as Jewish 
Voices for the Peace and 
that information in the 
resolution regarding com-
panies profiting from 
occupancy was provided 
by the United Nations, 
Singer maintained that the 
draft is biased. 

“My main issue with 
this is that it’s very one-sided,” Singer 
said. “It’s not hard to find news sourc-
es that support your point of view. I 
can go on the Internet right now and 
find tons of sources that say that the 

Holocaust never happened.”
She added that the resolution would 

be detrimental to relations between 
Israeli and Palestinian interest groups 
on campus.

“Say what you want about it — the 
intent is clear,” she said. “The pro-Israel 

community has been try-
ing really hard to build rela-
tions with the pro-Palestine 
community, and we would 
never bring up a resolution 
against Hamas.”

Tritons for Israel 
President Dafna Barzilay 
said it is not the council’s 
place to pass resolutions 
pertaining to international 
issues.

“We don’t support any 
such resolutions, even if 
it was pro-Israel or anti-
Hamas,” she said. “It’s not 

the business of A.S. to support interna-
tional problems that require that scale 
of spending and is not directly related 
to the university.”

In contrast, Ghosh said it is the 

council’s duty to be aware of global 
issues.

“If they believe that, why weren’t 
they there when we passed a resolution 
to support Haiti with allocations?” he 
asked. “Why weren’t they in the past, 
when we’ve been fighting for human 
rights in Sudan, fair trade in Africa?”

He said the resolution is meant to 
be a politically-neutral gesture. 

“It is not anti-Israel,” he said. “Israel 
was very cleverly kept out of it.”

Barzilay said that, regardless of past 
circumstances, it is doubtful the reso-
lution will have any effect other than 
dividing the campus. 

“What will it do realistically?” she 
said. “I don’t think the regents will 
divest from these companies, and, in the 
grand scheme of things, I don’t think it 
will help create peace in any way.”

The council will discuss the  passage 
of the resolution at their meeting this 
Wednesday, April 30, at 6 p.m. in the 
Price Center East forum.

Props to Burger King for offering non-alcoholic mimosas, 
Bloody Marys and sangria as an experimental 
new brunch menu (but ﬂops for not going all the way).

Flops to the Daily Beast, a blog that recently named 
UCSD one of the nation’s happiest colleges — obviously 

unaware of how depressed and racist we actually are.

OUT OF CONTEXT

“

This Time, They Went Too Far

After two years on campus without a car, I, like many before me, have developed 
an acute appreciation for life’s small-
er pleasures: anything and every-
thing off campus. 

During happier, more mobile 
times, I would never have thought 
that the stomach-turning texture of 
an over-microwaved Costco sample 
or the persistent stench of a crowded 
gas station could provoke a feel-
ing of such freedom. None of us 
really knew, in happily signing that 
on-campus living agreement, that 
we were resigning ourselves to the 
kind of 10-week dorm entrapment 
and dining-hall overconsumption 
that could breed insanity in even the 
most zen of dorm dwellers. 

Last weekend, though, my sense 
of confinement reached new heights. 

After a Friday night that ended in 
barely succeeding to make macaroni 
and cheese with a good friend at 4 
a.m. and promptly thereafter pass-
ing out face down — mud still damp 
on the back of my pants (don’t ask) 
— we awoke the morning after with 
insufferable headaches, green rhine-
stones plastered to our cheeks and a 
strong sense of purpose. 

At some uncertain point during 
a party in Hillcrest the night before, 
my friend had managed to rid her-
self of both a brand-new iPhone 
and her keys (Lady Gaga, anyone?). 
While the phone ended up safely in 
the hands of another friend some-
where in the Windansea area, her car 
keys nowhere to be found. Given our 
lack of vehicular mobility, options 
for recovery were limited. Just as 
we were preparing to concede our

67$7(�1(:6�³�Ever since the California 
economy really started reeling in 2006, 
Port Triton has been flooding with listings 
for the most infamous of student jobs: the 
unpaid internship.  

However, the rise in unpaid internships 
— keeping penniless college students that 
much poorer during the four-year student-
loan binge — recently caught the attention 
of federal regulators. According to officials 
in Oregon and California, companies 
are ignoring labor laws in offering these 
“opportunities.”

 It’s about time someone stood up for 
us. And government investigation of the 
unpaid internship’s legality should only be 
the first step in revising employment laws 
so that student interns get paid for their 
labor. Especially those putting themselves 
through college, who can’t afford to sacri-
fice 40 work hours a week for a bullet point 
on their resume. 

Until now, the six criteria legalizing the 
unpaid intern — established in 1947 — 
have served more as loose-fitting guidelines 
open to the employer’s interpretation than 

solid, unbendable principles. Because the 
criterion that the unpaid intern must ben-
efit more from the employer than vice versa 
is vague, an employer who forces a student 
to stuff envelopes all summer in exchange 
for a glowing letter of recommendation can 
still get off scot-free. 

But in rewriting this legislation more 
concretely to eliminate all chances of 
employers skirting its meaning, the federal 
government can make it that much harder

As a borderline obsessive “South Park” fan, I can recognize when creators Stone and Parker have pushed the boundaries past 
their best interests.

The dynamic duo have forged their way as two stoner geniuses 
who bulge the envelope like nobody’s business — but neither can 
continue happily offending old ladies and religious institutions with 
flamethrowers like these pointed their direction.

After episode “200,” CNN aired an interview with Yunus 
Muhammad, a member of Islamic fundamentalist group Revolution 
Muslim, who called upon all Muslims to “terrorize” Parker and Stone. 
Even though the interviewee claimed there was a distinction between 
“terrorize” and “kill,” Comedy Central was wise not to ignore that 
warning — and not only because their creative powerhouse was 
threatened. There comes a point at which comedy has to take a back-
seat to cultural sensitivity, and that point has officially been reached.

On April 23, after Revolution Muslim posters declared they 
“knew where to find” the producers, Comedy Central asked the 
NYPD to step up security at their central office in New York.

When the censored version of episode “201” aired, many fans were 
upset — and they became livid when Comedy Central refused to post 
the uncensored version online. However, while there are few things 
more annoying than an episode’s wrap-up speech being replaced with 
a four-minute bleep, Comedy Central did have the bigger picture in 
mind: prioritizing the show’s future (not to mention the lives of its 
creators) over the First Amendment rights of a single episode.

—Cheryl Hori
Associate Opinion Editor

South Park” creators Stone and Parker haven always, rather successfully, aimed to outrage a sizable portion of the 
population with every episode. Followers of Islam couldn’t 
really have expected the show’s characters to spare them — 
especially since this is not Muhammad’s first guest appear-
ance on “South Park.” 

Similarly, Buddha and Jesus have run the “South Park” 
gauntlet and emerged uncensored. Islamic group Muslim 
Revolution’s overreaction to Muhammad’s appearance in the 
newer installments of the satire could be expected, but produc-
ers should have taken the high road; that’s precisely the kind 

of controversial content that’s allowed their show to 
become so popular. What’s most disturbing is not 

the religious upset but Comedy Central’s will-
ingness to bow to lukewarm threats posted 

online. 
Stone and Parker’s “everyone gets 

theirs” concept hinges on the demoral-
ization of various groups in a humor-
ous manner; if more groups con-

tinue to demand special treatment, 
“South Park” won’t be the only 
show to sacrifice its anything-
goes autonomy to a few pissed-off 
viewers.

—Neda Salamat
Senior Staff Writer

Comedy Central censored the April 21 episode of “South Park” after a radical Muslim group threatened to kill 
show producers Trey Parker and Matt Stone for insulting 
Muhammad in the previous episode. 

The censoring of references to the Muslim prophet has 
sparked a nationwide discussion centered around religious 
respect and free speech. What’s most surprising, though, is that 
nothing like this has gone down before in the show’s 13-year 
history. 

When it premiered in 1997, “South Park” instantly became 
the show that went too far. Episode “200” wasn’t even the 
first time the “South Park” producers have featured 
Muhammad on their show. In 2001’s “Super Best 
Friends,” Muhammad made his debut as a turban-
clad Arab next to the founders of other religions, 
including Krishna and Joseph Smith.

Wednesday’s episode took it even further 
— but bottling offensive humor never made 
anyone stop laughing. Censoring episode 
“201” in response to a threat is probably 
the most ironic thing Comedy Central 
could have done. Looks like network 
officials didn’t get the signature “South 
Park” hint: Free speech will always 
out-shout fear and intimidation.

THE RIVETER By Ronnie Steinitz

though, we were struck by bril-
liance: With my roommate’s ZipCar 
account at my disposal, we’d surely 
be able to book it to Windansea, 
Hillcrest and back to campus in the 
span of a single hour — my forgetful 
friend returning with car keys and a 
renewed sense of personal dignity. 

The ridiculousness that resulted 
bore little resemblance to my inge-
nious plan. Evidently, we weren’t 
the only ones itching to flee campus 
on a Saturday afternoon, as each of 
the four designated ZipCar parking 
spots were empty for the duration of 
our two-hour search. 

After spending half the afternoon 
circling campus in a golf cart and 

matching sweatshirts, calling out the 
occasional campus tour guide on 
his dirty, vicious lies about UCSD, 
our vain search for a vacant ZipCar 
concluded. I took out a $20 from the 
ATM downstairs for her bus fare, we 
hustled to Gilman and Myers just 
as MTS Bus Route 30 was about to 
depart, and she was on her merry 
way out into civilization. 

What struck me most about the 
whole ordeal, though, wasn’t so 
much my bitterness toward the car-
sharing program, nor toward what-
ever cruel, selfish souls prioritized 
taking a ZipCar for a Costco joyride 
over my friend’s well-being. No, the 
whole episode reminded me most 
of what is probably my least favorite 

thing about this school: Without 
the aid of motorized transport, an 
on-campus dweller’s greatest expo-
sure to the outside world comes in 
the form of a $2 burger from Price 
Center. Or a Jamba Juice — which, 
as of press time, doesn’t even have 
a two-for-one promotion anymore. 
Great.

This dire state of affairs will 
probably only worsen come fall, 
when the Parking & Transportation 
Services department will be forced 
to cut campus shuttle lines and/or 
bus-line subsidies. In the meantime, 
I think I’ll start handcuffing my 
friends’ keys to their wrists when we 
go out together. It’s a long, cold walk 
back down to the bus stop.

Dear Editor,
The Resolution in Support of 

Peace and Neutrality Through UC 
Divestment from U.S. Corporations 
Profiting From Occupation seems 
to be a divisive issue, one that will 
polarize the community and the 
A.S. Council. Most, if not all, people 
will agree that the conflict is a con-
tentious issue — one not too many 
people want to get involved with. 

However, as a Jewish student who 
supports human rights and peace, I 
strongly urge all voting members 
of the council to vote in support of 
this, because doing so is the best 
and most logical course of action. It 
allows one to take a strong, neutral 
stance in regards to the Palestinian-
Israeli conflict — while promoting 
equality, the securing of human 
rights for all, justice and adherence 
to international law. 

Voting ‘Yes’ on the resolution 
clearly conveys one’s desire to not 
support violence on either side of the 
conflict, and affirms the fact that one 
wants nothing more to do with this 
decades-long conflict. However, vot-
ing ‘No’ essentially declares that one 
is taking a side in the conflict, and is 

a willing, indirect participant in the 
perpetuation of the injustices being 
carried out by an exclusive side. 

This resolution only helps to ele-
vate the level of respect for humanity 
and equality of all people — regard-
less of race, ethnicity, religious affili-
ation, gender and sexual orientation. 
Furthermore, in the 60-plus years of 
the conflict, this resolution is the first 
solution of its kind that is nonviolent 
and does not target any specific eth-
nic group, but rather a government’s 
policies that create injustice. 

This is the A.S. Council’s chance 
to not only be a courageous defender 
of human rights and equality, but 
also be part of the movement that is 
seeking to end the perpetuation of 
conflicts in the most neutral way.

Students Must Fight for a Level Playing Field
for companies to deny when com-
pensation is legally deserved.

Until then, cracking the whip on 
exploitative employers will remain 
a student task. Especially given that 
Career Services Center employees  
tend to skirt the obtrusive elephant 
in the room when offering students 
career opportunities.

While we wait for the slow-
moving cogs of bureaucracy to turn, 
the UCSD Career Services Center 
should take this opportunity to 
ensure that the internships adver-
tised on Port Triton offer more to 
UCSD students than daily coffee 
runs for the company’s head hon-
cho. 

Approximately half the college 
students who have held unpaid 
internships could testify that their 
employers didn’t play by the rules 
— at least, that’s what federal Labor 
Department regulators estimate, 
though they admit it’s difficult to 
uncover which particular corpora-
tions cheat their respective interns 
out of a salary, as interns are often 
fearful of filing complaints.

The internship evaluations 
posted on the Career Services 
Center website, however, provide a 
decent outlet for those students who 
wish to air their grievances against 
employers with the luxury of ano-
nymity. 

One student, who did an unpaid 
internship for the locally-based 
Virtual Reality Medical Center, 
complained that he accepted the job 
offer under the guise of gaining edit-
ing experience, though — surprise, 
surprise — the position mostly just 
involved doing an editorial assis-
tant’s grunt work.

And it’s not just the crisp pay-
check student workers are missing 
out on — it’s also legal protection 
against sexual harassment in the 
workplace, afforded exclusively 
to official employees. Although 

employment laws don’t apply 
to interns, the UCSD Academic 
Internship Program should inves-
tigate which companies have had 
employee-rights problems in the 
past, and focus on directing stu-
dents toward proven internships 
that provide a safe academic envi-
ronment. 

Internship Coordinator at the 
Career Services Center Christy 
Quiogue claims that all students — 

regardless of 
background 
— are on a 
level play-
ing field. But 
when the 
CSC’s most 
concrete effort 
to ensure 
this equal-
ity is merely 
advising 
students to 
research the 
internships 
that interest 
them, to make 
sure intern 
evaluations 
from past stu-

dents align with their career goals, 
Quiogue’s is a dubious claim. 

This approach fails to address the 
idea that more financially strained 
students may not have the luxury of 
adding unpaid internships to their 
resumes next to the part-time job 
that actually pay their bills. 

To make matters worse, in most 
cases students are required to accept 
college credit through AIP. While 
school credit might seem like a nice 
consolation prize for free labor, it 
comes at a hefty cost: AIP requires 
that students pay tuition for every 
college credit they receive. 

At $229 per unit and a minimum 
of four units per internship, stu-
dents end up paying the university 
at least $916 for their free labor. So, 

if you have to work for free, then 
— congrats — you will succeed in 
the post-graduation job hunt. If not, 
better luck next time.

Of course, there are the strong, 
competitive few — well-off enough 
to go without a salary for a summer 
— who swear the unpaid intern-
ship is worth the work in the long 
run. But it’s not fair that the current 
system accommodates rich kids 
with trust funds, while those from 
lower-income families are forced to 
forgo a professional opportunity for 
a paying job. This is where federal 
law can come into play to ensure 
students aren’t being abused for free 
labor.

It seems daunting for the lat-
ter group of students to speak out 
against unequal opportunity, but 
filing an educated complaint is the 
only way to change a company’s 
policy. Oregon state regulators, for 
one, have recently been attending to 
grievances from student employees, 
offering them back pay for their 
unpaid work. 

Because California is among the 
top states in violation of these laws, 
along with Oregon and New York, 
it is now our own prerogative to call 
attention to a sketchy system, even if 
it means giving up the chance for a 
radiant employer evaluation.

The federal government needs to 
revise and tighten its labor laws to 
spell out who must be paid for what, 
leaving no room for dispute. In the 
meantime, we the unpaid interns 
should inform ourselves on our own 
exploitation. In the end, it will help 
interns — particularly those who 
are underprivileged — to earn some 
deserved leverage with employers 
and boost their chances of post-
graduation success.

Hori.

A sandy five-rise conveniently located across the street from 
the Arriba Shuttle’s first stop, Regents 
Court is the only complex in the 
area that likewise understands your 
parking needs. Offering more spots 

than its residents’ cars can fill — via 
multi-level parking — Regents Court 
makes the last leg of the trek home as 
relaxing as it could be.

This aesthetically sharp, gated community plays host to more bachelor 
businessmen and small families than the average student, so if you’re search-
ing for the next party to crash, your best bet is to show up at Tapioca Express 
around 9 p.m. Other than that, four shopping centers (UTC, Costa Verde, 
Arriba and La Jolla Village Square) are only a block away, and the MTS Bus 
Route 201 bus will drop you right at your doorstep.

T ake the La Jolla Village Drive exit off the Interstate 805 and you’ll enter the shadow of a colony of white-
and-beige high-rises. This is La Jolla Crossroads: home of 
three sparkling pools, a stacked gym, a home theater and 
private tanning booth.

First, and least importantly, the 
elevators are possessed. If they’re 
not opening and closing their 
doors for no reason, they’re beep-
ing incessantly on the ground level. 
Then there’s the fact that the walls 
separating each apartment from 
the next are paper-thin- meaning 
you’ve got an all-access auditory pass 
to your neighbors’ shout matches, 
porn-star sex moans and deafening 
surround sound. Lastly, Crossroads 
is policed by Summit Patrol — a bunch of bored-looking 
Carl Winslow types, ready to write you up for using your 
dishwasher past 10 p.m.

Bottom line: If you’re willing to shell out the big bucks 
(around $550 to share a room and $1,100 for a single) to 
wake up to a gorgeously lit, devastatingly modern apart-
ment, Crossroads is probably the place for you — just be 
prepared to invest in a solid pair of earplugs. And, by all 
means, take the stairs.

However you like your townhome, Eastgate Mall has something to offer. Because the units are privately 
owned, can choose from a variety of models — some have 
three bedrooms, others have two, several are furnished 
with a brand new kitchen and hardwood floors while oth-
ers rock ’60s-throwback orange carpeting. Noise is mini-
mal: Even the sorority girls next door can’t throw a rager 
loud enough to pierce through the thick walls. Located less 
than a mile from the Regents parking lot, Eastgate mall is 
in a position to let you to bike, walk or shuttle to campus. 
But while campus may be close, you will probably need a 
car or bike to get to La Jolla Village Square or Vons.

LA REGENCIA AT COLONY
La Regencia is an ongo-
ing set of compromises 
perfectly suited for col-
lege students. Rooms are 
decent enough and rent is 
low- around $425 to share 
a room and $650 for a 
single-, though 3 a.m. fire-

alarm wakeups every month or two can be a hefty price to pay. 
Its location alongside the Arriba Shuttle and Vons means it’ll 
only take a quick two-minute stroll to catch the bus or pick up 
whatever amenities you may desire — including the Raid you’ll 
need to fend off the armies of ants that will parade through your 
home every time it rains. But did I mention rent? Cheap as dirt.

VERANO AT COLONY
Verano is the assembly-line version of some ambitious turn-
of-the-century city planner’s vision for the ideal suburban 
living space: a mazelike series of two-story earth-tone condos 
arranged in lopsided concentric circles, lined with papery 
white trees and dotted at random with patches of fenced-off 
lawn that miraculously stay green all year.

 Like most near-identical complexes that consume the sur-
rounding area, a single room at this sub-ritzy prefab villa runs 
anywhere from $900 to $1,100. Or you can cut that in half 
by bunking up with another brave soul unwilling to conquer 
condoland. Nightlife in the University City neighborhood is 
nonexistent, but consider that motivation to get creative for 
Facebook invitations to all those Popov-fueled dance parties 
you’ve been waiting to throw. And, with the Arriba Shuttle 
rolling by your window every 12 minutes, a quick trip to 
Porter’s is just a 30-second flight down the Verano stairwell.

A double-layered circle on the edges of the world’s most manicured dog park, La Jolla Colony offers options from high-rise hives (La 
Regencia) to makeshift villas (Pines of La Jolla) to con-
dos the color of baby food (Verona). 

Its biggest perks are a five- to 10-minute proxim-
ity to the first and second stops on the Arriba Shuttle, 
along with slightly lower rent than complexes closer 
to the first stop (the Venetian, Trieste, La Scala). Of 
course, living next to Vons and half of UCSD’s off-
campus population doesn’t hurt either.

I f you’re thinking of renting at Costa Verde, you have only one logical reason: location. There isn’t a single residence in this mon-
strous complex that requires more than a 30-second walk to a UCSD 
Arriba Shuttle stop or a diminutive 10-minute stroll to campus itself. 
When residents are asked to pay $1,700 for a two-bedroom apart-
ment, it’s no wonder the vast majority of residents are classmates. 

Unfortunately, the best way to take advantage of the shuttle stops 
is to bypass morning shuttles and sleep until noon — anything before 
11 a.m. is packed. Once you take away the short trek to campus, 
you’ve got a management office that doesn’t care whether you have to 
sell a kidney to pay off your all your neighborhood parking tickets, 
the slowest elevators since the Titanic and a water bill that’s deter-
mined by how many cold showers the creeper down the hall takes per 
day. There’s also a McDonald’s next door for the occasional late-night 
study snack, but after seeing one too many public-service fliers on the 
latest runaway groper, an evening out might not be worth the fries.

N estled between a luxury retirement home and several quaint condos, it’s no surprise that 
Trieste — in all its gray-beige glory — doesn’t exactly 
stand out. The nondescript complex is uncomfort-
ably reminiscent of Warren College apartments, fre-
quently subject to parking-space stealers and mainte-
nance crews who take weeks to fix a broken gate. It’s 
also a challenge to decorate the rooms due to their 
odd polygonal walls.  But, despite all its faults, Trieste 
is fairly pricey, running upwards of $1,700 for a one 
bedroom/one loft apartment.

On the up side, if you plan on cooking a lot, the 
furnished kitchen is a paradise of granite countertops 
and electric stoves. Campus proximity is also ideal: 
you won’t spend more than 10 minutes on the UCSD 
Arriba or Nobel Shuttles. Even better, Vons and 
Ralphs are a quick ride away — just catch an MTS 
bus on either Nobel Drive or La Jolla Village Drive.

Convenience is clutch when being weaned from the rose-colored teat 
of on-campus housing. In fact, many stu-
dents will sacrifice a small slice of their 
souls in an icy Costa Verde compartment 
just so they can minimize the commute, 
but the Playmor apartments prove you 
need not commit to a year of prison-like banality just to save gas money. 
Tucked into a bright suburban side-street, the ’70s-era dwellings are just 
a 15-minute walk (or a five-minute bike ride) from the always-speedy 
Regents Parking Lot shuttle. Each apartment in the cluster is owned sepa-
rately, so — depending on how well you can charm your landlord — rent 
(and decorating liberties) will vary. By paying around $650 a month for 
a single, you earn the right to poke tack-holes into almost every wall; my 
four male roommates broke the screen door and spilled beer/blood on the 
floor, and all they ever got were warnings.

Dwarfed by newer, expansive complexes like The Venetian Apartments and Regents Court, 
the diminutive Pines of La Jolla complex is easy to 
miss. In a gated cluster of vine-covered three-story 
buildings, Pines offers mostly two-bedroom units. Its 
tree-lined paths are accented by the pleasant sound 
of running water — courtesy of several fountains 
sprinkled throughout the complex’s lawns. There’s 
also a sweet pool and a private Jacuzzi. Its close 
proximity to the first Arriba Shuttle stop makes the 
modest complex one of the more comfortable living 
situations in the area, though a large population of 
young professionals and senior citizens also inhabit 
this serene zen garden, and don’t take kindly to 
bitchin’ ragers. That, and parking sucks.

Located a mere 15-minute walk from campus off Gilman Drive — or a five-minute ride on the MTS Bus Route 202, if you’re feeling exceptionally lazy 
— the Villa La Jolla apartments are prime for those who prioritize an unen-
cumbered way to get to school and easy access to Ralphs. Villa La Jolla may 
also be the cheapest place to live within spitting distance of campus. Seriously, 
this complex is absolutely empty—the landlords desperately need residents, so 
make sure to ask for $200 minimum off your rent.

Otherwise, Villa La Jolla is pretty run-of-the-mill. It’s got the standard pool, 
spa, laundry room and easily pilfered internet. There is, however, one issue — 
the walls are so thin, your neighbors might as well be in the same room.

L iving in downtown La Jolla is the piece of paradise you might expect: the ocean breeze in your backyard, a hot bevy of scantily clad 
beach babes strolling by and a lifetime supply of frozen 
yogurt. But don’t make the mistake of believing the 
neighborhood was made for the young and reckless — 
they’re mostly the rich and the retired. If a meaning-
of-life monologue from old Auntie Em across the 
street doesn’t sound like your cup of tea, then don’t 
even bother making friends with the neighbors. 

Apartment complexes in the area ask for a mini-
mum of $700 per month, but assuming you’re up for 
the challenge (and who isn’t, for a place near the fuck-
ing beach?), then welcome to heaven. The MTS Bus 
Route 30 stop is right around the corner, and from 
there, it’s a scenic 15-minute hop to campus. The way 
back is even better: No amount of stress can overcome 
the satisfaction of arriving home. Life is good.

ȅ������������CTV�GFKVQT

NC�LQNNC�UJQTGUYKPFCPUGC
S coring a spot on La Jolla’s prime stretch of paradise is no small feat, especially as the city continues to demolish the few shabby apartments left to make 
room for luxury condos. Unless you shit money, you either 
have to work as a live-in catsitter for some hospitalized bil-
lionaire or convince the landlord your behavior mimics that 
of a nun to snatch a room that’s upward of $750.

Whatever the forces you’re working against, if you can 
find a way to live walking distance from the prettiest beach 
in San Diego, you will be a happier person. On the weekends, 
you can whet your whistle at The Shack then stumble across 
the street for a burrito at Rigoberto’s, the neighborhood’s infa-
mous 24-hour Mexican eatery. The tipsy walk home against 
the smelly sea air will get you wondering: Why ever leave?

But if you really need to, like, go to school or something, 
you can catch a bus at one of the MTS Route 30 stops along 
La Jolla Boulevard for a 25-minute trip back to reality. Just 
be sure to hurry home before sunset — each one is some-
thing out of a dream.

Across-hatch of hip-sters, grad students and the occasional 
professor, Hillcrest is a slice 
of what college should be 
— filled with more trendy 
coffee shops (Cafe Bassam) and thrift stores (Frock You, 
Flashbacks) than University City has highrises.

As for nightlife, Hillcrest is home to a few quaint dive 
bars, but the real party’s always at one of the area’s many 
crackin’ gay clubs. Try the Brass Rail for cheap drinks, 
and the Gossip Grill for ladies of every persuasion.

Not as crowded or bourgie as downtown, Hillcrest 
is small enough to navigate on bicycle or foot. If you’re 
looking to go green and save gas, the commute is made 
simple by a UCSD Shuttle that stops at the UCSD 
Medical Center in Hillcrest, where staff and students can 
hop on for a free ride every 30 minutes. However, afford-
able housing can be hard to find; be prepared to scour 
Craigslist for weeks, and save your money in the mean-
time — rooms can cost upward of $700 a month.

Sorrento Valley

O ne exit north of Genessee sits the sleepy commercial town of Sorrento Valley, a business district with polar virtues and 
vices when it comes to housing. If you’ve got plans 
to move here, be prepared to sacrifice everything 
glorious about being young and unemployed.

Sorrento Valley is mainly inhabited by corpo-
rate tycoon-headquarters like Texas Instruments 
and Qualcomm, as well as small-timers like 
University Readers. But in between the office 
buildings, you might spot some livable apartments 

complexes like Wateridge or Archstone Torrey 
Hill (offering around $700 for a single) — most of 
which are a five-minute drive from the nearest gro-
cery stores and late-night drive-thrus. It’ll be a little 
longer to drive to campus though. 

Needless to say, it’s all about your priorities. If 
you’re looking to land a larger apartment and focus 
on your studies next year, then Sorrento Valley’s 
got you covered.

t W hen it comes time to unwind in the night-time, Clairemont has 

little more to offer than late night 
runs to Cotixan. Just south of 
University City, the quiet, child- 
and meth-den-friendly neighbor-
hood is kind of a downer for the 
college crowd. But as long as you 
have a car, you can escape the 
labyrinth of shoddy little boxes for a trip downtown in 15 minutes or to Pacific Beach in 10, 
with no RSOs, gridlock traffic or drunk bitches puking on your doorstep. 

Rent in Clairemont is more than reasonable: You can score your own room in a spacious 
house for about $600. The quiet neighborhood is also home to a few restaurants — although 
most of them are grocery chains and generic franchises like Target. If you’re skimping on a 
parking pass to save some cash (or the planet), city buses can get you to campus — but unless 
you’ve got the foresight to catch it an hour in advance, the bumbling MTS Bus 41 will likely 
result in an awkwardly late arrival.

A sunny patch of adorable cafes and authentically sketchy dive bars about 15 miles southeast of campus, University Heights is the ideal incubator for UCSD’s fringe population of hipster hopefuls. Sure, getting there is annoying 
as all hell — either braving the everlasting traffic on Interstate 5 or biking your trendy 
ass to the Hillcrest Medical Center shuttle stop — but that’s half the appeal. 

See, living in University Heights will test your commitment to an anti-UCSD 
subculture lifestyle of decorating a quaint ’50s home, frequenting cramped, seedy 
drinking holes and living such an unreasonable distance from campus that only your 
closest (and coolest) friends will visit. 

Upsides include cheap rent, delicious eats (try El Zarape and Pomegranate) and 
local hangouts within biking distance. (Hit up Twiggs for quiet reading and Lancers 
for cheap drinks). The closer you live to Park Boulevard, the better. Yours truly tore 
herself from the Heights after a two-month summer holiday because she couldn’t han-
dle the commute, but who knows — maybe you’re indie enough to last the entire year.

ȅ����������������OCPCIKPI�GFKVQT

University Heights

Pacific Beach

W hile the picturesque hills of La Jolla cater to a slightly more geriatric demographic, Pacific Beach is a bar-packed alternative for San Diego’s beach bums and twentysomethings. If you don’t want to be woken in 
the wee hours by Jäger-fueled frat boys and blacked-out skinny bitches, you should 
find a place at least three blocks from the main Garnet Street drag (for around $750 
a month). Don’t worry. Everything cool in PB is a quick walk or bike ride away. 

Hit up Henry’s for the best deal on produce this side of the border, and Trader 
Joe’s for cheese, tea and wine. Nighttime hotspots range from dingy dives like the 

Nite Owl to classy cocktail bars like Bar West. Shopping on the strip is good, 
too. Lodged between liquor stores, smoke shops and tattoo parlors are thrift 
stores of the $3 rummage-bin sort, alongside pricier consignment varieties 

like Buffalo Exchange.
PB is the best place in town to satiate your row-

diest urges to rage once I-House parties have lost 
their charm. The only requirement: a car, or at 
least a friend who won’t mind trekking back and 
forth along the I-5 for the next nine months.

ȅ������������YGD�GFKVQT

I f you’re looking for an easy trip to campus, Ocean Beach isn’t for you. Public transporta-tion can only take you downtown — very 
slowly — and your Free Bus Zone sticker is worth-
less on OB routes. But a bumper-to-bumper com-
mute down Interstate 5 is easily offset by OB’s tight-
knit community of boho surf bums and bar-fly 
semi-babes with an eye for your engineering degree. 

The housing scene is a quick remedy for com-
muter remorse: Singles go for $600 to $800 in a 
two-bedroom apartment, just blocks from the beach. 
The OB People’s Co-op and a weekly Wednesday 
farmers’ market are the neighborhood’s alternatives 
to Ralphs. But beware: if you stay in OB too long, it’s 
easy to forget about the rest of San Diego, especially 
now that OB is undergoing a nightlife overhaul. 
South Beach Bar and Grill, home of San Diego’s best 
fish tacos, is adding a second floor to it’s beachside 
location, Pizza Port just opened a microbrewery. 
However, not everyone in town has evolved from 
the “Footloose” era: Pac Shores’ bar bouncers 
will still boot even the cutest of whiskey-eyed 
Guardian editors for dancing.

viously lost three out of four games 
at the Santa Clara Invitational in 
mid-April.

“We obviously wanted 
to win against Chapman 
because it was a confer-
ence game and because it 
was Senior Night,” Bocian 
said. “But I don’t think 
the win really changed 
anything.”

Senior  ut i l -
ity Stephanie Heinrich 
scored within the first 
minute of the match. 
UCSD went on to score 
10 unanswered goals 
over most of three quar-
ters, before Chapman 
answered with a lone goal 
at the end of the third 
period. Redshirt fresh-

man goalkeeper Allie Taylor replaced 
Quane entering the final period, 
shutting out the Panthers to seal the 
15-1 Triton victory.

Heinrich led all 
scoring with three 
goals. Junior attacker 
Hanalei Crowell, fresh-
man attacker Audrey 
Mitchell and junior util-
ity Kelsey Schultz added 
two apiece.

Ten different Tritons 
scored in the match, 
including all of the 
team’s seniors who par-
ticipated.

“I enjoyed playing 
with all the seniors,” 
Bocian said. “All of us 
started, which doesn’t 
normally happen. It 
gave us a chance to 

reflect on our last four years, because 
it’s the last time all of us will really get 
to play together like that.”

As the No. 2 seed — an improve-
ment from last year’s No. 4 spot — the 
Tritons have a bye in the first round 
of the WWPA Championships.

They will face the winner of the 
showdown between No. 7 Sonoma 
State and No. 10 Chapman at 3:40 
p.m. on April 30. LMU will face 
the winner of the No. 8 CSU San 
Bernardino matchup and No. 9 CSU 
Monterey Bay at 5 p.m. 

The Tritons finished their regu-
lar season with an overall record of 
16-18, which included a seven-game 
win streak from March 27 to April 
9. LMU finished at 24-4, a program 
best.

▶ W. WATER POLO, MYVT�WHNL���

After Egypt’s failure to qualify, 
Nigeria currently stands second only 
to Cameroon in the FIFA rankings 
of the African nations to qualify 
for the World Cup. Nigeria will be 
a case study of sorts, providing a 
measure for how much “home con-
tinent” advantage boosts a squad’s 
tournament fate. The “Super Eagles” 
have some quality attacking options 
with Obafemi Martins, Yakubu and 
two-time African Player of the Year 
Nwankwo Kanu leading the frontline. 
Joseph Yobo and Taye Taiwo will 
anchor the defense, and Chelsea’s 
John Obi Mikel has proven himself to 
be a strong holding midfielder at the 
highest level. 

With virtually every one of its 
players based in the world’s top 
leagues, Nigeria seems ready for 
the high level of competition it 
will face in South Africa. However, 
the team did crash out of the 2002 
cup, and failed to qualify in 2006. 
Consequently, Nigeria’s chances of 
rising from the group stages are far 
from certain. Nevertheless, the team 
should emerge as a runner-up if its 
players can keep their nerve on the 
world’s biggest stage.

Only eight years after their 
shocking fourth place finish, South 
Korea has proven that it should not 
be overlooked. World powerhouses 
Portugal, Italy and Spain learned 
that lesson the hard way in 2002, 
when each lost to the co-hosts of the 
tournament. Now led by native Huh 
Jung-Moo, South Korea will look 
to repeat that upset and build on a 
hugely successful qualifying cam-
paign that saw them go unbeaten 
and become top qualifiers out of 
Asia. Captained by Manchester 
United winger Park Ji-Sung, the 
squad is certainly not without talent, 
with a speedy attack led by Park and 
Bolton forward Lee Chung-Yong. 

Yet with the majority of the 
squad playing in South Korean and 

Japanese clubs, much of the team 
is untested against the world’s top 
talent. South Korea will certainly 
give each of its opponents in South 
Africa a difficult match, and making 
it beyond of the group stages is not 
out of the question. However, with a 
majority of the South Korean play-
ers based in leagues that don’t rank 
among the world’s best, the team 
might narrowly miss the opportunity 
to advance in this year’s tournament.

Like South Korea, Greece has 
had recent unexpected international 
success that it will aim to build upon 
in South Africa. After an astonish-
ing victory over Portugal, Greece 
emerged as the Euro 2004 champion, 
marking the team’s most successful 
finish ever in an international tour-
nament. The Greeks also boast nota-
ble international talent: Liverpool 
defender Sotirios Kyrgiakos will 
lead the back line, and Celtic striker 
Georgios Samaras is expected to pro-
vide the goals. 

However, a majority of the squad 
plays for Greek clubs, and will have 
to elevate their game considerably in 
South Africa. In addition, this is only 
Greece’s second time qualifying for 
the World Cup, as a 1994 appearance 
ended after three straight losses. 
A nation deep in financial trouble, 
Greece could certainly benefit 
from a successful showing in South 
Africa; still, it will take a substantial 
effort and perhaps a bit of luck for 
the Greeks to move past the group 
stages. 

Group B should be a dogfight — 
easy games will be hard to come by. 
Look for South Korea and Nigeria to 
stay close on points, with the final 
game in the group stages deciding 
who advances. 

Ever do blow with Maradona 
and want to tell me what it was like? 
Do you think Park Ji-Sung was a 
more-than-adequate replacement 
for Cristiano Ronaldo? Write me at

The junior will be UCSD’s lone representative at the  NCAA

KEITH OKASAKI | GOLFKevin Durant led five players in double figures with 22 points, and the

AROUND THE LEAGUE

<PM�:M\]ZV�
WN �\PM�/ZMI\
5M[[Q�IP
With less than two months until the 2010 FIFA World Cup — perhaps 
the most conflict-transcending event 
in the world — kicks off in South 
Africa, I will assess the chances 
of the four hopefuls in Group B: 
Argentina, Nigeria, Greece and 
South Korea.

With an overload of talent that 
includes Lionel Messi, arguably 
the world’s best player, Argentina 
would seem a safe bet to get out 

of the group stages. Yet it should 
not be overlooked that just seven 
months ago, the team was in seri-
ous danger of failing to even make it 
to South Africa after three straight 
losses; the sanity of manager Diego 
Maradona even fell into question. 
The Argentines lost five of seven 
qualifying matches from October 
2008 to September 2009, and only 
a last-gasp Martin Palermo goal in 
the final qualifying match against 
Uruguay punched their ticket to 
South Africa. 

Afterward, Maradona found it 
necessary to prove god had noth-
ing to do with what came out of his 
mouth — in contrast to the divine 
intervention of his 1986 “hand of 
god” goal — saying, “Those who did 
not believe ... let them suck my dick, 
and keep on sucking it.” 

While Maradona didn’t really 
prove anybody wrong by running 
Argentina’s worst qualifying cam-
paign in recent history, his team did 
come together when it really mat-
tered — a quality that could bode 
well for their fate in South Africa. He 
may have driven away Juan Roman 
Riquelme, one of the country’s top 
midfielders, but his attacking options 
are still second to none, with the 
likes of Messi, Carlos Tevéz, Gonzalo 
Higuaín, Diego Milito and Sergio 
Agüero to back him up. An older 
defense may not be as world-class as 
the strikers, but experience in high-
pressure international matches is 
often underestimated. Qualification 
in South America is never easy, and 
despite Argentina’s struggles, it is still 
very capable of a deep tournament 
run, and should emerge as the win-
ner of Group B.

UCSD athletes won six events 
against elite international

opposition at the
Triton Invitational

on April 24.

WOMEN’S WATER POLO — After finishing 
the regular season with a conference record of 
8-2, UCSD will now enter the Western Water 
Polo Association Championships as the No. 2 
seed. 

Standing in their way is top-seeded Loyola 
Marymount, which boasts a perfect 8-0 confer-
ence record and beat the Tritons in their only 
matchup this season by a score of 10-4 on Feb. 
20. Since that time, the Tritons have risen in the 
polls from unranked to No. 18 in the nation — 
while LMU has remained steady at No. 8.

“Our team goal is to win WWPAs,” senior 
utility Stephanie Bocian said. “Our first game is 
this Friday against Sonoma State, and we try to 
take it one game at a time. Since all these games 
are very important, we try not to overlook any 
competitors. Our hopes are to play LMU in 

the conference championships and win, but we 
haven’t talked about LMU directly.”

The Tritons closed out their regular sea-
son with mixed results, routing Chapman 
University 15-1 on April 16 before falling to 
San Diego State 11-3 at the annual Harper 
Classic on April 23. The two matches were 
the team’s final home games of the season, as 
they prepared to travel to CSU Bakersfield for 
the WWPA Championships from April 30 to 
May 2. 

On April 16, No. 13 SDSU maintained its 
dominance over the Tritons, winning its 10th 
straight Harper Classic to remain a perfect 
10-0 in the annual cross-town matchup. SDSU 
scored early and often, netting the first four 
goals of the game before senior Triton attacker 
Audra Bloom put UCSD on the board with 4:23 
left to play in the first half. 

UCSD didn’t score again until the fourth 
quarter, by which time the Aztecs had convert-

ed six goals to take a commanding 10-2 lead. 
Bloom and sophomore attacker Jessica Tran 
scored twice for the Tritons in the loss.

“That was a rough game that was not 
expected at all,” Bocian said. “Most of us felt 
pretty prepared for the game, but it didn’t show 
when we played... We want to move on from 
that game and not really think about it. It’s 
kind of embarrassing on our part. We’re mov-
ing forward and are very concentrated on the 
WWPAs, which is what ultimately matters the 
most.”

A week earlier, the Tritons saw a much 
different outcome at home against Chapman. 
Backed by a strong outing from senior goal-
keeper Markayla Quane on Senior Night, the 
Triton offense attacked the Panthers with a 
steady onslaught of scoring. The win was a 
significant leap for the Tritons, who had pre-

  TO PROVE

Facing Division-I competitors, interna-tional athletes and even an Olympic gold medalist, the Tritons held their own — and proved they belong among 
such stellar company — at the UCSD Triton 
Invitational on April 24.

“The competition here is definitely higher 
than at conferences,” head coach Tony Salerno 
said. “And, in some cases, it’s higher than at 
nationals. To be a winner here is pretty special.”

Former Olympic gold medalist Félix Sánchez 
— who won the Dominican Republic’s first-
ever gold medal in the 400 hurdles at the 2004 
Athens games — competed in the 400-meter 
dash on Saturday. Sánchez, a graduate of nearby 
University City High School, grew up in the La 
Jolla Colony apartments behind Doyle Park, 
though he has represented his country of heritage 
since 1999. He last competed in the Triton Invite 
12 years ago as a member of Mesa Community 
College; this time however, he competed as one 
of the world’s most accomplished hurdlers, and 
easily ran away with the race. Sánchez posted a 
time of 45.99 seconds. 

The Olympian’s presence exemplifies the level 
of competition attracted to the Triton Invitational: 
Schools stream in from across the country, and 
individual athletes come from around the world. 
Laura Turner, who represented Great Britain at 
the 2008 Olympics in Beijing was also present, 
and took both the 100- and 200-meter races. The 

Triton athletes also proved they belonged.
Senior Christine Merrill won two events, 

senior Kelly Fogarty forged a new school record 
and four other Tritons earned hard-fought victo-
ries at a star-studded home meet. Junior Theresa 
Richards and senior Leon Baham posted top-five 
marks in Division-II with their wins, while junior 
Caprice Thompson and senior Linda Rainwater 
also notched victories in their respective events. 

Fogarty finished third in the 100, and took a 
close second in the 200. Fogarty was already the 
school record holder in the 100, and a time of 
24.09 seconds in the 200 gave her the record in 
that event as well. 

While it is not uncommon for Merrill to win 
multiple events at a meet, doing so at an elite 
invitational was especially head-turning. Merrill 
came up victorious in the 100- and 400-meter 
hurdles, holding off UCLA’s Ryann Krais in both 
events.

Theresa Richards joined the ranks with a 
victory in the javelin throw, setting a personal 
best by over 10 feet with a mark of 149’9” — just 
enough to edge out University of Kansas thrower 
Heather Bergmann’s distance of 149’4”. Richards’ 
distance was the fifth best in Division-II this sea-
son. Holly Kane from the University of Tennessee 
finished third.

The University of Tennessee’s Matt Maloney 
dominated the men’s javelin event with his throw 
of 230’11”. It was one of the top 10 in all of NCAA 

so far this season, beating out UCSD’s sophomore 
Nick Howe’s effort by nearly 20 feet.  

Baham’s win came in the 400-meter hurdles, 
when he tied for first with Mesa College’s Clark 
Coyle at 52.18 seconds. Though Baham came 
down the home stretch with the lead, he  clipped 
a hurdle along the way, allowing Coyle to catch 
up. But Baham finished strong and did not sur-
render the lead, allowing the two athletes to share 
the victory — not even a photo finish could not 
determine a winner. Baham’s time is the fifth 
fastest in Division-II this season, and third best 
in UCSD history. 

“It’s exciting,” Baham said. “When you run 
with faster guys you run faster. Its always a chal-
lenge and I welcome it.”

Rainwater won the high jump with a mark of 
5’10”, while Thompson came out with a victory 
in the 3,000-meter steeplechase with a time of 
11:27.20 — the fourth best in school history. 

“Our athletes see a high level of competition 
— Division-I level and above — throughout the 
year,” said Salerno. “When they get to Division-
II national they feel very comfortable, and they 
know they are deserving to win.”

The Tritons have two weeks to prepare for 
the CCAA Championships, which will be held at 
UCSD starting May 6.
