State . to Restrict Fees? 
40 Legislators Want to Take UC Fee Authority From Regents 
BY CAROLYN ,FRIDAY 

Sacramento Correapondetit 
A constitutional amendment that 

would prohibit the Regents from 
implementing tuition or any fee 
increases for UC students without 
approval of the · legislature was 
i~troduced in the Assembly yesterday. 

among the three public segments," 
Leonard said. 

"By placing this measure on the 
(November) ballot, the people of this 
state can express whether the 
University of California should be 
treated any differently than the state 
universities and community colleges, 
neither of which have the unilateral 
authority to increase the price of 
admissions regardless of the will of the 
legislature or of the people," said 
Leonard. 

prompted Saxon to declare university 
plans to make up for two-thirds of any 
such cuts by imposing tuition, thereby 
ending a 112-year old tradition of 
tuition-free education in the system. 

time. We should wait until after June 3 
to avoid any effort to soften the impact 
of Proposition 9. This amendment 
shouldn't be perceived as some way of 
getting around Prop 9." 

UC Student Lobby co-director Paul 
Rogers says this amendment is not 
meant to soften the imp,act of 
Proposition 9. "Students would I tI be 
hurt by its passage. We jOlt want to 
make sure 'students don't shoulder 
almost the entire burden if it does pasl," 

According to Student Body 
President's Council President Don 
Mclennan of UC Santa Barbara, 
Saxon is genuinely upset about the 
amendment but has apparently decided 
to avoid public statement until the 
voters decide on Proposition 9. 

Sponsored by Assemblyman 
,William Leonard, R-San Bernadino, at 
the request of the UC Student Lobby, 
the amendme'nt had bi-partisan support 
in both the Senate and the Assembly, 
40 legislators signed on as co-authors 
by the time it officially crossed the desk 
yesterday afternoon. 

Leonard said he does not plan to drop 
the amendment even if voters defeat 9 
in two weeks and thereby eliminate the 
immediate threat of tuition. Several 
legislators, however, declined to 
support the measure until after June 3, 
according to Senator Walter Stiern, D-
Bakersfield. 

said Rogers. . 
Assemblyman Tom Hannigan, D· 

Davis, sees broader implications in the 
amendment. He is afraid it will curb at 
least one of the Board of Regents' 
constitutionally guaranteed powerl of 
autonomy vis a vis a state Jerislature. 

"I believe the level of student fees is 
an important public policy question 
which has far-reaching implications 
about who can attend which institution 
of higher education. The legislature 
should playa greater role in approving 
and coordinating the fee levels in and 

According to a statement hom UC 
President David Saxon, "Such a 
constitutional amendment would serve 
no purpose," since, he argued, the 
Regents fully intended to consult not 
only with the legislature but also the 
other two segments of higher education 
before imposing any tuition.

assemblyman Tom Bates, said, "It's

Saxon, Third World 
Meet on Proposal 

Approximately 20 Third 
World students met with UC 
President David Saxon 
yesterday to discuss the 
adminis tr ator' s proposed 
"California Roundtable for 
Equal -Educational Opportu-
nity." 

Sax'on's roundtable 
proposal would bring together 
chancellors and administra-
tors from universities across 
Califomia to discuss common 
problems with affinnative 
action and equal opportunity 
programs. The president set 
forth the proposal at the 

Marc~ Regents meeting and 
said he wanted to meet with 
the roundtable by the middle of 
June. 

"He told us he's having 
some trouble getting it 
together," UCSD's Jules 
Bagneris said. 

When he does, it will not 
include a student. 

"We were disappointed that 
he didn't include a student on 
the committee. He said he 
didn't like the idea of students. 
In the past, any time students 
had direct participation he 

said, it didn't go very well," 
Bagneris said, reading from 
notes he took at the two-hour 
meeting. 

The group meeting with the 
president yesterday included 
three students from UCSD, 
Bagneris, Daryl FJli. and 
Arturo Herrera, who also went 
over a wide range of issues of 
concern to the Third World 
community in the UC system. 

"We discussed concerns of 
Third World students in light 
of Proposition 9 . We wanted 
to find out if any contingency 
plan would be made for 
Propositio 9 and get a 
commitment from Saxon that 
existing affirmative action 

~grams would not be cut," neris said. ut on that score, the group 
also left Berkeley disappoint-
ed. 

Saxon told the students that 
new programs would be the 
first to feel the Prop 9 axe. 
And that made a number of 
the students unhappy.

China's ICBM 
Should Shake 
Up Strategies 

BY FRANZ SCHURMANN 
PacifIC New. Servic:e 

The inter-continental ballistic missile that China fired liOme 
6 000 miles into the Pacific on May 18, will send lasting waves 
oi turbulence ripp~ng through superpower relationships. On 
each 01 the three previous occasions when China made major 
strategic moves, the complexion of international relations was. 
radically altered. 

Schurmann is a prolessor 01 history and sociology at UC 
Berkeley. 

The first occa.ion was the nuclear sharing agreement 
reached between China and the Soviet Union in October, 
1957, immediately after the Soviet's first lIuccellful ICBM 
launch. The Soviet launch, of course, aroused grave fears of a 
"missile gap" in the US, leading to the deployment of 
.ubmarine launched nuclear milliles and IIOme 7,000 nuclear 
warheads in Western Europe. But the Soviet agreement with 
China, which promised that Beijing would develop its own 
independent nudear capabi~ty, roused even graver US 
concerlll. 

To counter the potential Chinese nudear threat, the United 
States betan a mauive military buildup in the Far Ea.t, aided 
IJy Chiang Kai-.hek who did likewise from his ba.e in Taiwan. 
lbe result was the Quemoy crisis of the following year, which 
threatened peace worldwide. 

By 1959, Preaident Eisenhower had apprarentJy persuaded 
Premier Khrushchev to cancel the nuclear sharing agreement 
with China as a first se~ toward a US-Soviet thaw. But the US 
buildup in the Far wt continued unabated, eventually 
culminating in the Vietnam war. 

The second Chinese nudear scare came in October, 1964, 
when 8eiiinI exploded its fir.t atomic device. Thi. time, the 
0Unese action alarmed the Russian. as much as the 
Arnericalll, deepenins the Sino-Soviet split into a chasm. 
Khrushchev, who fell from power within two days of the 
0Unese blast, 'was reported to have approached US 
Ambassador Averell Harriman with a proposal for a joint US-
Soviet surgical strike to take out the Chine.e nudear test 
facilities in SinkianS. The US declined, but made no secret of 
the fact it regarded China a. the chief trouble·maker behind 
North Vietnam. The .ecret US Operation Rolling Thunder 
involving sustained bombing over North Vietnam was 
launched the following February - as much in· reaction to 
growing fean of Chinese strategic strength as to frustrations in 
Vietnam itself. 

By 1967, the Chinese threat had led to US and Soviet plans 
for anti-Chinese anti-ballistic missile systems: stop-gap 
measures designed to shoot down slow and wobbly liquid-
fueled Chinese missiles. The US system was never built , but by 
1968, Moscow was ringed with some 64 launchers. One year 
later, the Soviets and Chinese fought a restricted but bloody 
frontier war, the first time in modern history that communist 
powers drew blood from each other. 

The third Chinese strategic weapon breakthrough to shake 
up superpower relations came in 1970. In April, the Chinese 
launched their first orbital satellite, making it a point to note 
that it flew over both Moscow and Washington. In October of 
the same year, they launched a missile that traversed some 
2,000 miles - as far as it could fly within Chinese territory. 

This time however, the following year witnessed a dramatic 
change in superpower relations - for the betler. The year 
1970 has been a period of particularly grave international 
angers , with the US mired down in Vietnam, the Soviets 

building a missile newwork in Egypt against the Israelis, and 
the ' French and West Germans pursuing detente with Russia 
while US-Soviet relations cooled over disputes on the SAL T II

Iranian Deportations to Rise 
INS Crackdown Meant to Appease Americans 

BY WIWAM BEEMAN AND 
JON STEWART 

President Carter's immigra-
tion policy toward Iranian 
visitors in this country may 
soon resull in the largest 
deportation action against a 
single nationality since World 
War II. While the proposed 
policy may assuage the pent-
up frustrations of some 
Americans, critics say, it is not 
likely to bring the US any 
closer to resolution of the 
hostage crisis. 

Stewart and Beeman are 
Pacilic News Service editors 

Indeed, any move toward 
mass deportations will serve 
only to confirm the prevalent 
Iranian view that the United 
States is committed to the 
systematic harassment of 
Iranians and dismemberment 
of the Islamic revolutionary 
government. 

The threat of deportations is 
more acute now than at any 
lime since the Administration 
ordered the. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service to 
investiga'Ie the status of all 
I ranian students last 
No~mber. Since then, some 
58,000 Iranian students have 
been interviewed by INS 
officials and 3,883 have left 
the country, either voluntarily 
or otherwise, according to INS 
officer Vern Jervis. There are 
approximately 70,000 
Iranian students in the United 
States. _ 

However, the number of 
"voluntary" departures may 
soar in coming weeks, as 

terms, which must be renewed 
annually. In the recent past, 
students have been admitted 
on "duration of study" visas 
good for as long as they stayed 
in school. 

According to some well-
infonned sources, almost none 
of the Iranian student visas will 
be renewed if the new 
regulations are adopted this 
summer. Only those students 
with immediate families living 
as permanent residents in the 
United States, or those with 
severe medical problems, will 
receive extensions, according 
10 these sources. If this is true, 
tens of thousands of Iranians 
will lace two-week voluntary 
deportatioq dates when their 
one-year visas expire, which 
usually occurs in June or 
September. 

Already there are signs that 
the INS is cracking down hard 
on the Iranan students. 
Sixteen students were arrested 
in a single sweep in Detroit 
recently, mostly on minor INS 
infractions. Bail · was set at 
$2,000 to $5,000. 

"This is a generalized 
attempt to secure the removal 
of as many Iranians as 
possible, " said Detroit 
immigration attorney Abdeen 
Jabara , who is representing 
three Iranian students under 
deportation order·s. He 
estimated that there are some 
2,000 Iranian students in 
Detroit schools. 

"They're trying to get them 
out on the flimsiest terms 
possible. They're moving very 
vigorously," he said. "The 
students are well aware that 
there is a vicious attack being 
launched on them, and they 

know that it comes from the 
top , the . President. This is 
going to embitter a lot of 
Iranians. It is not the way to 
make friends and influence 
people. It's going to be another 
black mark on this country." 

Jill Stritter, foreign student 
adviliOr at the University of 
Texas.Austin, echoed the 
comments of other academic 
officials regarding the new INS 
posture: "There is an 
increased level of anxiety 
among the Iranians over the 
lack of certainty about their 
future," she said. "They can't 
make any plans because they 
don't know how long they can 
stay. Many are enrolling in 
summer school in order to 
maintain their student status 
and to get as much school as 
possible before they might 
have to leave." 

The Austin campus had 
221 Iranian students at the 
beginning of the spring term, 
and only about half that 
number at the end of the term. 
Some undetermined number 
left under voluntary 
deportation orders. 

With school terms now 
ending, thousands of Iranians 
will face a long and uncertain. 
summer. Those who' cannot 
afford to attend summer 
school are barred from 
employment or from returning 
home for a visit. <! If an Iranian 
student leaves the country for 
any reason, " says the INS' 
Jervis, "he can't get back in. 
This applies only to Iranians ."

earticularly hard in Sen

Number of People 
On Relief Climbs 

WASHINGTON - The 
number of Americans fil ing 
new claims for unemployment 
insurance reached the highest 
levels in at least 13 years 
during early May, a new sign 
that the economy is falling into 
a deeper recession than the 
Carter administration predicts. 
. The Labor Department 
repo'Yted yesterday that a 
seasonally adjusted 616,000 
jobless people filed for 
unemployment insurance 
during the week ending May 
10, up from 595,000 for the 
week ending May 3. The latest 
figures represented the highest 
number of initial claims for one 
week since the government 
began collecting seasonally 
adjusted da ta in 1967. 

The weekly unemployment 
claims information is a good 
indicator of changes in -the 
nation 's employment rate, 
which shot up from 6.2 
percent in March to 7 percent 
in A~ril . Economists said 

yesterday that the new figures 
suggest another sizeable jump 
in unemployment will be 
revealed when the May rate is 
issued early next month. 

President Carter's econo-
mic advisers officially are 
predicting a short and mild 
recession this year, with 
unemployment peaking at 7.3 
percent by next year. 
Privately, however, some 
government economists say 
the jobless rate could top 7.3 
percent this month .

In Washin gto n , the

apparently because of the 
potential problem of

States is committed militarily. 

Pentagon spo kesm an 
Thomas Ross said the US

He said there 'have been no

"no evidence that North Korea 
is moving to take advantage of 
the situation."

some violence, reportedly

Empire Reigns 
At Box Office 

HOllYWOOD - The 
Empire Strikes Back has 
struck with a vengeance at the 
movie theater box office. It's 
enough to make Darth Vader 
smile. 

"We never thought it would 
beat Star Wars," said an 
ecstatic executive at 20th 
Century-Fox . "This is 
unbelievable." 

The Empire Strikes Back 
took in $1,336,305 in 125 
theaters on opening night 
Wednesday. It doubled the 
opening night revenues of box 
office champ Star Wars - if 
you make a statistical 
comparison of averages 
between certain theaters. 

The movie is the second in a 
projected nine Star War 

movies. It not only continues 
the saga of Luke Skywalker 
and his battle against

introduces a startling twist to 
their galactic struggle between

negotiations. On the eve of the Chinese missile launch, the 
three great powers seemed hopelessly bent on ever worsening 
conflict. 

Yet by spring of 1971 , a remarkable easing of world 
tensions was underway . The US was suddenly engaged in 
simultaneous detente with the Soviets and the Chinese, 
symbolized by the " ping.pong diplomacy" wi th Beijing and the 
announcement of a SALT agr ement with Mo cow in May, 
1971. 

What led to the defusing of world tensions is still unclear, but 
tliere are some grounds for believing that the US persuaded 
Chi na not to deploy its new missile in exchange for an improved 
relationship with the US. China's apparent capitulation also 
had the effect of paving the way for the US·Soviet SAL T 
treaty .

the road this Memorial Day 
weekend for seas hor es, 
mountains , d eserts and 
airports, the state automobile 
association predicts. 

Nearly the entire 1,000· 
mile long state, with its 24 
million inhabitants , is expected 
to be blessed with fine weather 
and mostly clear kies, with 
wind gusts all along the coast. 

California State Automo· 
bile Association spokesman 
Tom Rohner , who predicted 
the cutbacks in travel , told the 
drivers of the state's 18 1,12 
million vehicles they should 
find adequate fuel supplies an 
the highway Saturday through 

Monday. . But he advised 
motorists to eye their fuel 
gauges after dark. 

With gasoline costing 
$1.25·$1.45 pe r gallon, 
Rohner said "price motiva· 
tion" will keep many people 
around home , or reduce the 
length of their trips. 

" It will cost an average car 
$40·$50 for a round trip from 
San Francisco to Reno," he 
said , nearly double what it cost 
last year. 

In Sacramento, the 
California Highway Patrol 
expected heavy travel in resort 
areas , major highways and 
a round state parks. 

Last year , 68 persons died 
in Memorial Day weekend 
traffic. The highest fi gure on 
record was 83 in 1978. The 
78·hour Memorial Day 

period, for official purposes, 
ruris from 6 pm Friday to 
midnight Monday. 

In the San Francisco Bay 
Area , roads are expected to be 
jammed, with the longes t lines 
in prospect Monday night at 
al l bridge approaches and 
main arteries . 

In Southern California , 
where some 80 percent of the 
state's population lives, the U 
Forest Service expected all 
campgrounds to start filling 
before dark on Friday. 

" Most of the state's Ueaches 
are already booked up," said 
spokeswoman Nancy Yeager. 

"Most of the campsites are 
on a first come·first served 
basis. It looks like its going to 
be really busy all over the 
weekend." 

Whatever secret motives and nego tiations may have 
grounded the Chinese missile ten years ago, they no longer 
hold today. In fact, little of the world scene of a decade ago 
remains unchanged. Today , China is emerging as the United 
States' friend and ally, while the USSR is again seen as our 
principal foe. As the USSR sought active military cooperation 
against China in 1964, today it is the US and China who have a 
de facio alliance and a relationship much c1Oller1han either ever 
achieved with the Soviets.

And today it is principally the USSR, with its 12·year·old 

ABM system, that has the most to fear from the newly.

US hardliners will do doubt interpret the Chinese launch as a 
lilnificant payoff on the IO-called "China Card" strategy - the 
eflort by national security advilOr Zbigniew Brzezinlky to line 
up Washington and Beijing asainst the Soviet Union. In fact, it 
may even explain, in part, the sudden resignation of former 
Secretary 01 State Cyrus Vance, who vigorously opposed the 
China Ilrat.,. While Vance's reasons for resiJning may have 
be!m just 81 he stated, it is probable that he knew about the 
a...e launch plans, and protested them, prior to his 
n!lipation. • 

tn any case, the aftermath of this month's Chinese launch is 
aIr~)' dear: US links to China wiD become even closer, while 
both US and Chinese relations to the Soviets will worsen. The 
decade-old lull on the Sino·Soviet border could end. 

"the role of the pathologist 
who resigned from the hospital 
staff was described as minor. 
An inveltigator for the 
Veterans Administration said 
the man quit two ' weeks ago 
when hospital officials 
confronted him with the 
charges "but his part was 
miniscule, from what I 
understand."

Why now? There il good evidence that the Chinese only 
make major moves in the strategic field if they believe the time 
and opportunity is right. That hold, true of previous Itrategic 
moves, all of which occurred in limes of international tensions 
when it served China to send out warnings to either or both of 
the superpowers that Beijing was a force to reckon with. 

And it is true today. Beijing leeS the Soviet move into 
Afghanistan as a first step towards a major expansion of Soviet 
ROwer in the Middle East, an interpretation shared by much of 
the US foreign policy establishment. Thus, the missile fired into 
the South Pacific serves notice on MolCow that China is no 
longer merely a regional power, but is now the third member of 
the ICBM club. 

Whatever the immediate reactions, past evidence suggesll 
that military buildups waJ occur in all three countries, and that 
regional conflict - now, primarily in the Middle East - can be 
expected to worsen.

Baseball Talks Continue 
In the Meantime, Games Are Up in the Air 

NEW YORK (AP) -
Talks aimed at preventing a 
major league baseball strike 
stre tched into the early 
mornings hours today as 
negotiators for both sides 
remained locked in talks with a 
federal mediator. 

The six major leagues 
games played last night were 
completed before the midnight 
deadline which the players had 
established on April I , though 
the players had said the games 
would be completed no matter 
what the hour. 

N ego ti a tors for th e 
clubowners and the players 
association resumed joint talks 
at 10 pm EDT after a four. 

. hour session proved to be the 
longest of three during the day 
as the two sides attempted to 
reach an agreement which 
would prevent the first 
interruption of a major league 
season in history . 

Several teams which were 
moving from one town to 
another last night and this 
morning kept to their 
scheduled plans despite the 

threatened strike which was 
expected to begin with today's 
games. 

" It would take a small 
miracle to prevent a strike," 
said Marvin Miller, executive 
director of the union. " It could 
be a long one, but nobody has 
a crystall ball." 

The players voted virtual 
unanimous strike authoriza· 
tion during spring training 
when contract negotiations 
became stalled. On April 1 in 
Dallas, the executive board of 
the players association voted

games, wiping out 92 
contests, and then to walk out 
again on May 23 if no contract 
was reached. 

Talks since then have made 
little if any progress with the 
two sides deadlocked over the 
issue of compen.sation for 
premium free agent signings. 
The clubs have demanded a 
sys tem be implemented 
permitting them to replace 
certain free agents who sign 
with other teams. The union 
has rejected that idea, saying it 
would be an a ttack on the free 
agent system which has 
produced a huge ' jump in 
player salaries. 

The last management 
proposal on compensation 
called for ranking players 
statistically, either by at·bats 
or, in the case of pitchers, by 
game appearances, and then 
classifying the top half of each 
category as "premium" 
players. Such players would 
have to satisfy other criteria 
such as selection by eight or 
more teams within a set 
number of re·entry draft rolls. 
Those players would qualify 
for compenlation with teaml 
permitted to freeze a set 
number of players before 
losing a compensation 
replacement performer. Miller 
called that proposal "an 
impoll5ibility. " 

With the strike deadline 
only hours away, federal 
mediator Kenneth MoffeUsaid 
the compensation isaue has 
not even been discussed at the 
morning meeting. "We went 
over minor issues and nothing 

happened," he said. "There 
was no progress." 

Miller said a clique of 
owners has been working to 
provoke a strike of the players. 

"It's the same group who, in 
1976, within a day of our last 
agreement, made public 
statement of what they 
planned to do to us four years 
hence," said MiDer. "That is 
unheard of in labor relations." 

The union chief ~ged 
that the management 
negotiators headed by Ray 
Grebey, had displayed "a lack 
of good faith from beginning to 
end" in these talks. 

Pitchers Joe Niekro, plaver 
representative of the Houston 
Astros, and Nolan Ryan, who 
signed a $1 million·per·year 
free agent contract with the 
Astros last winter to become 
the highest paid player in the 
game, sat in on the Friday 
talks.

the cult status of television's 
Star Trek. Three years later, 
The Empire Strikes &ck is 
the successor to the coveted 
position, and although the 
latter-day fairy tale now has a 
bittersweet edge to it, the 

~ic is still there. 
Th~ film tells of the 

adventures of Luke Skywalk-
er, Princess Leia and Han 
Solo after the triumphant 
destruction of the Death Star. 
They, along with the relit of the 
RebeJ forces, have vacated 
from their base on the fourth 
moon of Vavin to a new 
inatallation on the ice planet

An unexpected attack from

inatruction and training as a

colony run by Han's crony. 
Lando Carlrission , only to be 
turned over to the clutches of 
Lord Darth Vader. 

Meanwhile, Luke senses 
through the Force his friends ' 
predicament, and against the 
&mbined warnings of Yoda

Cloud City to rescue Leia and 
Han and to challenge Darth to 

a lightsaber duel to the death. 
The screenplay by Leigh 

Brackett and Lawrenc e 
Kasdan wavers bet"een 
complexity and c1ulteredness. 
George Lucas ' story abounds 
in side plots, anti ·c1imaxes and 
deft twists, some of which are 
not at all pleasant. The ending, 
while a happy one, is subdued 
and bothersome. 

But The Empire Strikes 
Ba ck is strong in both 
character development, from 
the romantic stirrings between 
Leia and Han to the 
progressing maturity of Luke, 
and in dialogue, from the 
verbal confrontations of the 
couple to the philosophical 
musings of Yoda . 

The acting is, in a word, 
spectacular. Mark Hamill 's 
reprisal of his role as Luke 
Sky walker is superb. Carrie 
Fisher and Harrison Ford are 
an epic fantasy's answer to 
Katharine Hepburn and 
Spencer Tracy with their 
respective portrayals of 
Princess Leia and Han Solo. 

The picture that marches to a different drummer.

'Busboys' An Exception to 
White Rock Monopoly 

Also to Rock Mediocrity: You 'U Think, Enjoy 
O nce, a very long time ago 

(jeez - thir ty years!), th 
music that is now ca lled rock 
and roll was emerging from 
rhythm and blues. You could 
hear the stuff on disks that 
were termed " race records, " 
and the peopJ that performed 
it had strange names like Fats 
Domino, Bo Diddley and 
Arthur "Big Boy" Crudup. 

In the early 1950s , when 
artists of their ilk were blazing 
ihe rock trail for others to 
fo llow, these records were 
listened to by very few people 
- specifically, few W hite 
people . " Race records," of 
course, transla tes to " Black 
records." 

restaurant, where they 
performed last Sunday night. 

A nd despite its racist 
overtones, I suppose the 
"novelty" tag wasn't entirely 
inappropriate. You simply 
don 'I find many young Black 
rock acts around anymore . 
You also don't find many 
bands, Black , White or 
otherwise, as refreshing, 
vigorous and memorable as 
this one, either. 

The Busboys, as both an

exaggerated eye-ro ll s and 
grins to t h row racist 
stereotypes in the crowd's 
collective face as a taun!. It 
made you stop and think -
but not long enough to stop 
enjoying the Busboy's musical 
punch or songwriting 
inventiveness. 

The c10sesl parallel I can 
draw between this Los 
Angeles-based seldet and a 
well·known recording group 
would be a comparison with 
the Specials, currently 
England's top ka band. 

The two outfits a re similar 
not so much in thei r music as in . 
th eir overall approa c h 
(generally frantic and a bit 
silly) and lyrical focus (topical , 
but not rabidly antisocial). 

Anyone with even a cursory 
knowledge of American pop 
musical history knows how the 
work of Black talents has been 
adapted, refined , exploited 
and just plain ripped·off by 
White musicians. 

idea and a working band , are 
loaded with intriguing (and 
unsettling) ironies and 
contradictions. Here are five 
Blacks (and one White -
drummer Steve Felix) dressed 
up like spit-and·polish porters , 
serving up processed rock 
product (pasteurized after 
three decades of refinement by 
White acts) in a suburban 
diacozoid nightclub, singing 
lOngs in the British punk mode 
while jumping about like a 
Motown soul review wired up 
on too many diet pills. 

Beyond that, the Busboys 
are perhaps the most unique 
band I've seen in the past year. 
Keyboardists Brian O'Neal 
and Michael Jones contribute 
some of the seediest, reediest 
runs this side of Costello and 
Devo, while guitarist Phillip 
Charles chugs through with 
simple, surging rhythms.

with clever lyrics and well- called Ku Klux Klan. One 
conceived hooks, fleshed out tune, Minimum Wage, was a

inducing arangements. many at menial employment with 
of the Busboys' songs are real relevance to everyday 
straight-ahead pop tunes with concerns, in contrut to the 
mildly socially-conscious affected mock-Sex Pistols 
themes: Social Security vitriol too many new wavers 
(about romantic ups and spout. 

It's gotten to the point where 
Black performers doing 
mainstream rock and roll have 
become a rarity (never mind 
calling a band Blondie - why 
not · a group named The 
Aryan,?) You might even 
term such artists "novdty 
acts ." 

That's what the Busboys, a 
largely Black group with a 
sound billed "new wave," were 
advertised 81 by Encinitas' 
Chicago Mining Company 

Half the time during their 
set, I couldn't tdl if they were 
parodying their black R & 8 
heritage for their (nearly) 
IiIlywhite audience's enjoy-
ment, or going through their 

This punkery, though, is 
mitigated by the lustrous

'Petrified Forest' Shows 
America With Depth 

" I chose Petrified Forest 
because it is an American 
play, " director Adrianus 
Schriel said Wednesday night 
after the preview of his show in 
Mandeville Recital Hall. 

Schriel, an Englishman, felt 
it was necessary to add that 
this was a good American 
play. 

What he meant was that the 
1933 play ·is not' a naive, 
wholesome, value-laden tour 
of a small American town. 

In fact, playwright Robert 
Sherwood took particular pain 
to convince us from the start 
that Petrified Forest is going to 
take a different approach to 

America. He opens with a 
disgruntled worker talking 
about the paradise many 
believed the grand Red 
experiment in Russia to be, 
then takes off with a vicious 
attack on the American 
Legion in his first stab at 
character development. 

Sherwood then introduces 
the stock girl , who will fall in 
love. She is not,however , 
above using harsh language to 
discribe situations she is 
unhappy with, and has a 
toughened understanding of 
her alcoholic grandfather. She 
is particularly vituperative and 
unhappy when she describes 

AI1If

Ron Butt. u Duke Mantee in Petrified Fored. 

Black Mesa, Arizona, the 
town in which her father 's cafe , 
the scene of the play is set . 

h is , she believes , a dead-
end highway stop, as active 
and growing as the nearby 
petrified forest. 

Then somethin g 
Thornton Wilder nev e r 
thought of - an intellectual! 

He is, to be sure, the last of a 
dying breed, a self-proclaimed 
heir to the legacy of Eliot's 
Hollow Men . A failed artist , 
this Alan Squier has certain 
glibness that seeks out the 
failures and hopes of others 
without really recogl1izing his 
own. 

He is the catalyst. 
When Duke Mantee, a man 

whose disaffection with life is 
eased (though not solved ) by 
his propensity for murder and 
robbery, herds the entire cast 
into the small cafe in Black 
Mesa while he waits for his 
lover , Squier makes the bes t of 
a dismal situation a nd ta lks to 
others. 

What he finds is that almot 
everyone in the cafe is 
unhappy with their role , 
whether it is wife, aspiring 
artist , gunman or busines · 
man. They are not necessarily 
ready to make a change unless 
Squier and the unnaturally 
high pressures of being held 
hostage by gunmen ends their 
arrested development. 

As Squier brings out his 
companions to talk about their 
troubles, he becomes more 
committed to them - and 
himself. 

Squier is aided by the cast of 
Petrified Forest. Five actors in 
particular , Neal Le e 
Mendelsohn as Squier , 
Lucinda Holshine, Ed 
Coughran, Libby George -
Cola han and Tyrone Jones , 
are excellent.

'Wings': Drama Around Town 
"Wise, magical and 

shattering," the New York 
Time. called WINGS, "an 
intensely moving vi.ion, a 
voyage of illummation." The 
San Diego Repertory Theatre 
wiD present the 10c.a1 premiere 
of this critically aclaimed new 
piaL on May 29. 

The focus of the play is on 
Emily Stilson, a onetime .tunt 
pilot, a daring aviatrix, a wing 
walker. WINGS charts her 
amazing final flight into the 
innermost reaches of her mind. 

Shattered out of a peaceful 
retirement by a stroke, Emily 
is thrown into a bizarre world 
where she cannot hear to 
understand, cannot speak to 
be understood. 

Using sound, ~ghts, and 
'pace, WINGS invites the 
audience to share in her 
magnificent and moving effort 
to transcent her splintered 
reality. Peter Robinson, a 
veteran director and drama 
educator, is staging the play. 

WINGS will play Thursday 
through Sunday evenirlBs at 8 
pm through June 28. There is 
a Sunday Matinee on June 22 
at 2:30 pm. Due to the

.01 THE BOARD OF DlREnoRS. 22. 
Think of a ship as a corpora-
tion, and it's not farfetched at 
all. A destroyer may have 
fifteen officers, other ships 
even fewer. Even the most 
junior officer gets to share in 
running the show. 

You become part of the 
management team when you 
get your commission as an 
ensign after just 16 weeks of 
leadership training at Officer 
Candidate School. 

Choose to be a Navy officer 
and you are responsible for 
people and equipment almost 
immediately. 

Many officers gQ on for 
further advanced schooling. 
The Navy has literally dozens 
of fields for its officers-

everything from nuclear pro-
pulsion to systems analysis, 
oceanography to inventory 
management. In graduate 
school, this training would 
cost you thousands, but in 
the Navy, we pay you. 

Ask your Navy representa· 
tive about officer opportuni-
ties, or mail this coupon for 
more information. Or call 
toll-free 800-841-8000 lin GA 
call toll-free 800-342-5855). 
There's no obligation, and 
you'llleam about an excellent 
way to start a career in 
management. As a college 
graduate you can get manage-
ment experience in any indus-
try. But youll get it soone.-
and more of it- in the Navy .

es himself. Ron Butts, as 
Mantee, reprises the role ' 
Humphrey . Bogart originated 
on stage and film. The casting 
director that found Bogart was 
a genius; Butts and Schriel 
avoid a Bogart impersonation 
and keep the smooth, 
commanding toughness of the 
part. 

Schriel has done an 
excellent job with Petrified 
Forest, with the exception of a 
weak opening scene. 

The show runs for only 
three perfonnances, the last 
two of which are tonight and 
tomorrow night at 8 pm in the 
Recital Hall.

Busboys: No 
ignoring Em 
Continued from poge 9 
most rigorously Beach 
Boyesque sort. 

White groups like the 
Roll i n g S t o.n e s h a ve 
appropriated Black music's 
attitudes and situations for 
decades without anyone 
giving it a second thought, but 
the Busboys did something 
strikingly rare with their song 

. - they described a scene 
straight out of White Middle 
American suburbia ("Ten the 
coach it'll be a1right...111 be the 
big man in the game tonight") 
with all the crew-cut charm of 
the Four Freshmen. Tum· 
about is more than fair play -
it's good rock and roU. 

Racial issues aside, the 
Busboys are a downright 
~uperior band that deserves to 
be heard by everyone. 
Hopefully, their forthcoming 
Arista album will win 
converts, putting a dent in pop 
music's current state of de 
facto segregation.
