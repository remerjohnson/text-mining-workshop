Kolis was convicted of perjury for 
fallifyinl her ~ddress on her petition for

Young Soci~lilts Alliance. 

Kolis was sentenced to five days in jail

handled by Peter Young, who handled 
the Peter Bohmer T rial ~nd worked on 
Anthony Russo's case. 

A group of six students exclusive of the 
press and Kolis' staff listened to Kolis as 
she said, "My fight is a continuation of 
the fight for free speech in San Dieao 
that 5t~rted in 1912 with the struale

'Impact Report 

UCSD Fil~s 'Negative' Statement 
By John T ~ylor 

UCSD has filed with the Com-
prehensive Planning Organization (CPO) 
a declaration that no adverse effects on 
the environment will result from the 
construction of the 512.5 million first 
phase of Third College. 

The CPO had requested an en-
vironmental impact report on the 
grounds that the 250-student housing 
portion of the construction would be 
sufficient for only half of the students 

using the complex, thus causing 
pollution and transportation problems. 

Chancellor William McElroy said that 
the formation of a comprehensive report 
would delay construction of the complex 
for a year, and might resu lt in a 10 
percent increase in total cost . 'The 
university filed the negative declaration 
in hopes that construction could begin 
next month as planned . McElroy said that 
under the state Environmental Quality 
Act, the university is not required to 
submit to the CPO's request . 

A final decision , if any, would come

Volume 21, Number 15 U CSD Tuesday, February 26, 1974 

from UC President Charles Hitch and the 
UC Regents . 

T rue Excellence 

In a letter to the CPO in which heurged , 
co-operation , McElroy stated : "If we 
postpone our schedule to complete a full 
environmental impact statement at this 
time, our progress toward achieving the 
well-rounded academic program , so 
essential to true university excellence, 
will be delayed at least a year and at 
considerable expense." He told the San 
Diego Union that the plans for Third 
College have been public for years, and 
that the CPO's request should not have 
been made in the last weeks before the 
beginning of construction . 

CPO Executive Director Richard Huff 
said the county Air Pollution Control 
Board and the state Air Resources Board 
have made similar requests for reports, 
and that it would have been irresponsible 
for the CPO not to do the same . He said 
h is organization found the negative 
declaration inappropriate considering 
the scope of the project . 

Master Statement 

The Chancellor said that residential 
facilities have been planned with no 
possible adverse effects in mind, and that 
the UCSD architect is updating the whole 
university plan to include a master 
impact statement. 

He added that he had been under the 
impression, from a conversation with 
Huff, that the CPO would not ask UCSD 
to submit an extensive impact report 
Huff said he did not recall the con-
versation . '. 

The Chancellor noted , " I think the city 
and the county have to ma e up their 
minds if they want a first class university 
here . If you look at thiS (The CPO report) 
logically, I don't think there's any 
question they're talking about zero 
growth ." 

Huff : "I don't think they (the 
university) are going through anything a 
lot of private developers haven 't. A 
branch of the state has the obligation to 
comply with what other people comply 
with ." 

Student Committee Holds Privacy Seminar 

Since 574 Third College students are 
already on campus, and since Fourth 
College, opening in September, will need 
much of the space presently occupied by 
Third, building of the Third complex 
must proceed on schedule in order not to 
hamper plans for both colleges, McElroy 
said . 

Do you have to consent to search of 
your dorm room by the resident dean? 
What are your search and seizure rights? 
These and related topics will be 
discussed at a privacy seminar tomorrow 
in the Humanities Library Auditorium, 
according to Paul Osterman; chairman of 
a committee of resident students in-
terested in the legality of the present 
residence halls contract . 

The purpose of the seminar is to 
acquaint students with their legal rights 
as dorm residents and to arrive at a 
consensus of opinion on the issue of 
room searches by residence halls staff. 
All interested persons, including 
representatives from the Office of 
Student Affairs, UC Police Department, 
and the Resident Deans' office, are in-
vited to attend, according to Osterman . 
He stated that Raphael Levens, legal 
counsel in the Office of Student affairs, 
wi II be present to answer students' 
questions . 

Reasonable Cause 

According to Levens, the present 
College Handbook contains a clause 
which permits University personnel who 
have a direct responsbillty for the en-
forcement of campus rules and 
regulations to "conduct a search of a 
student's room if they have reasonable 
cause to believe that the room is being 
used for an illegal purpose or other use 
which seriously interferes with campus 
discipline." University personnel in this 
context are defined as "Residence Hall 
Staff, the Resdient Dean, the Colleae 
Dean, Met Vice-Chancellor and the 
Executive DMn of Student Affain or a 

By Raphael Levens 
person designated by him to act in his 
behalf ." 

"Legally, University personnel are 
neither private persons nor law en-
forcement officers for purposes of 
searching a student's room . University 
personnel have a special legal status as a 
result of their responsibility to maintain 
campus discipline. Thus, University 
officials have more authority than a 
private citizen to conduct a search but 
less authority than the police." 

University officials may legally 
conduct a search of a student's room if 
the search is reasonable . This · has been 
defined by the courts to means a 
reasonable belief by a University official 
that a voilation of college rules and · 
regulations has occurred which would 
interfere with the University's fun-
damental duty to operate as an 
educational institution . In such a case, 
University personnel may search a 
student's room in furtherance of this 
education~.1 purpose . The courts, 
however, are divided on the issue of 
whether a search warrant or the consent 
of the student must be obtained before 
such a >earch occurs. The courts agree 
that University officials may not delegate 
their special legal status to the police. If 
a search is conducted by the police, all 
the search and seizure requirements of 
the Fourth Amendment to the Con-
stitution must be observed. 

The primary issue raised by these 
considerations is the extent to which the 
pre5Mt policy of searching rooms 

Units II ilnd III 
conforms to the Taw. If the resident deans 
utilize the police to conduct searches, 
more students may be prosecuted than at 
present. An alternative, the committee 
feels, would be administrative pol icy 
changes which guarantee student privacy 
while allowing sufficient latitude to the 
resident dean to carry out their 
disciplinary functions . A second alter-
native would be a change in the College 
Handbook rules which now permit room 
searches without first obtaining a 
student's permission . Other alternatives 
will be discussed at the seminar, which is 
scheduled for 8:00 p.m . 

The complex, wh ich will cover five 
acres and comprise four buildings and 
200 parking spaces, is scheduled for 
completion by December of next year . 
The unit will contain a science/teach ing 
laboratory faci lity, a faculty resear-
ch/ science building, a classroom/ lecture 
hall structure, a nd a communications 
building. Academic units II and III are 
tentatively planned for occupancy by 
1980. 

Muir to Become Vacation Center 
A vacation center will 

open at UCSD this summer, 
centered in the Muir dorms. 
The UC Santa Barbara 
Alumni Association in co-
operation with the Al umn i 
and Friends of UCSD will 
run the center . 

Emphasis will be on week 
long family vacations . 
Services will include 
childcare and activities for 
participants of all ages. 
Vacationers will stay at the 
Muir Apartments and take 
their meals at the Muir 
cafeteria. 

The UCSD Vacat ion 
Center was born when a 
similar center operating at 
UC anta Rarbara became 

By Roberta Rehm 
so popular that 6,000 
prospective vacationers had 
to be turned away last year . 

jim Beckley, Muir Dean, 
states, "They approached us 
hoping to expand the UCSB 
operation to San Diego." 
Accordingly, a contractual 
agreement was drawn up 
between the two alumni 
groups.

contest to establish a 
permanent name for the 
University/Student Center. 
The rules of the contest are: 

1. To submit a name you 
must be a student, faculty 

It's getting close to that time again - Budget Review 
and Allocation - and it would be a great help to TUSC if 
you began to seriously evaluate your present monetary 
situation and began to make projections for 1974-75 
(next year) . 

Presently TUSC is funding some 36 student 
organizations, ' activities and programs. If your 
organization has never been funded, and desires fun-
ding, it is most important that you begin considering the 
monetary goals of your group. Budgets should be 
itemized as specifically as possible and as' TUSC is 
contt'mplating a new _ Drocedure for allocating the 
Student Ac~ivity Fee (S18/..stu/year) this is extremely 
important. Please submit your projected budget no later 
than March 15, 1974 to 'TUSC allocations - 250 Me' . If 
you have any questions whatsoever, please don't 
hesitate to call Steph or lorn at X2943.

or staff member of UCSD. 

2. An individual can 
submit as many proposed 
names as he wishes. 

3. All proposed names 
must be returned by March 
12, 1974, to 250 Matthews 
Campus. 

4. Proposed names 

should be reflective of the 
facility itself, which will be 
the center for student 
activities on campus. The 
facility will also be 
available for faculty and 
staff use. 

Protect Thyself 

After the March 12, 1974 
deadline, the proposed 
names will be reviewed. 
The Building Committee 
wi II select three names 
which will be presented to 
the Chancellor. From these 
proposed three names, a 
permanent title for the 
Building will be deter-
mined. The individual who ' 
submits the chosen name 
will receive a prize of 
S25 .00. The individuals who 
propose the second and 
third names will receive 
prizes of S15 .00 and $10.00 
respectively . 

Police Officer Connie Borchers of the San Diego 
Police Department will demonstrate se lf-defense 
techniques for women on Tuesday, February 26, at the 
monthly meeting of the San Diego County Chapter of 
the National Organization for Women (NOW). 

Ms. BoTchers will explain how women can effectively 
defend themselves without extensive training in the 
martial arts. 

The meeting will begin at 7:30 p.m. at the San Diego 
Women 's Club, 2557 Third Avenue. The public is in-
vited . 

The Third College Facilitators Brune to 
Chair The Third College Facilitators are a group of 

students who can provide 
information and a wide 
variety of referrals, (i .e. 
grad requirements, em-
ployment opportunities, 
financial services, etc .). The 
job of the facilitators is to 
aid students as they 
proceed with their 
educational endeavors at 
Third College. 

The faci litators are also 
responsible for conducting 

works~ops , clinics , and 

group sessions under the 
supervision of Philip 
Raphael , Counseling 
Psychologist at Third 
College. ;rhese workshops 
will be deSigned to assist 
students with problems 
related to thnic, drug, 
political , and social 
matters. 

The primary job of the 
facilitators is to assist off-
campus students with 
problems related to the 
University. The aim is to 
keep off-campus s(udents 
abreast of activities hap-

pening at UCSD in general, 
and Third Co lege in par-
ticular . 

In order for this program 
to be effective, suggestions 
and assistance are heeded 
from all the students at 
Third College. Information 
is needed on what kinds of 
referrals, workshops, in-
formation, etc., would be 
most useful to the students. 

The facilitators can be 
contacted through Philip 
Raphael, 701MC, ext. 1162. 
There is also an office at 
701MC, ext . 2106.

USIU Modern 
Donce Workshop 

The Dance Workshop is composed of students 
studying under the B.F.A. Program at the United States 
International University ; the main purpose being to 
train professional dancers . The dance Department is in 
its third year of existence under the direction of Clair 
Wolchinsky. (Other dance instructors include Jean 
Isaacs, Betzi Roe Weinberg, and George Willis .) 

Of the 180 units required for graduation, 93 units are 
in dance, 37 are in dance-related subjects (such as 
notation, acting, music, etc .) and 50 units are in elected 
general education courses. Students perform their own 
choreography in the concerts presented at the end of 
the Fall and Winter quarters . In the Spring, one major 
concert is presented to the public for six performances. 
Additional performing opportunities during the year 
include public and cable television appearances and 
presentations at local high schools. 

Fourth year students form the touring company and 
are in charge of choreography, classes, rehearsal 
schedules , transportat ion schedules , lecture-
demonstrations, and master classes given at colleges 
along the West Coast. 

Tuesday evenings workshop, February 26 from 7-9 
p.m., will be instructed by Sarah Carretson, who will 
lead warm-ups based on the Craham Technique. The 
concert Wednesday evening at 8 p.m. will include a 
variety of student choreographies in full costume. 
Dances will vary from the lyriC, classical , comic, 
dramatic ; accompanied by jazz, classical and electronic 
music . 

Both the workshop and concert will be held in the 
UCSD Cym . Free admission . For further information 
contact Renee at X 2286. 

Records: 
ICE WATER, Leo kOHke - Capitol 
ST-11262 

While leo's guitar finger-picking 
technique is certainly one of the 
most precise and generally one of 
the very best on record, in the past 
I've considered his vocal ten-
dencies to be a liability on his 
music-making overall. His tenor 
range often seemed strained, thin 
in sound and unexceptional in 
quality . Certainly it's been his 
guitar play (and not his voice) 
which has drawn consistent praise 
from critics and the public alike 
dating back some three years to his 
long Takoma Records release, the 
superb all-instrumental, 6 & 12-
Strinl Guitar. 

On this, leo's fourth Capitol lP, 
Ice Water, his previously unex-
ceptional voice has grown to be 
both acceptable and sufficient to 
well complement his ever pleasant 
guitar play. Of the albums ten 
selections, four are instrumentals 
and of the ten only the opener 
"Moming is the Long Way Home", 
seems musically inferior. Personal 
favorites include the solo in-
strumentals "A Child Should Be a 
Fish", with its intricate play on 
harmonics, and the sensitive 
traditional "All Throup the Nllht" 
which is handled beautifully with 
an elusive delicacy so difficult to 
attain, yet so essential to the 
character of the frail composition . 

Vocal pieces like Tom T. Hall's 
fine "Pamela Brown" are handled 
quite naturally and very well by 
leo and his competent four-piece 
country oriented back-up band of 
Cal Hand, dobro and steel guitar; 
Bill Barker, piano ; Bill Peterson, 
bass; and Bill Berg, drums. 

If you liked any of leo's earlier 
Capitol albums [Mudlark, 
Greenhouse, My Feet Are Smiling), 
you'll find Ice Water even better. 
It's a winnerl

IT'S GETTING BETTER, Atlantis 

Vertigo VEL-1018 

"Atlantis" is one of the very few · 
deCidedly high quality rock bands 
to emerge from the European 
continent in the wake of the ex-
treme success experienced by the 
Dutch group "Focus." The German 
quintet, lead and distinguished by 
their fine vocalist Inga Rumpf, play 
comfortably and capably in the 
contexts of both hard-rock and 
relaxed light-jazz. 

Inga Rumpf possesses the 
potential to become an ex-
traordinary vocalist. Her vocal 
technique, marked by advanced 
rhythmic and supple phrasing 
capabilities and combined with a 
throaty rough-hewn timbre, rounds 
her voice into a complete, un-
commonly effective, instrument. 
Based upon the evidence of this lP 
alone, Inga deserves to be num-
bered among the very best female 
rock vocalists in Europe. 

While the majority of It's Getting

is particularly effective with

incidentally performed the in-
valuable "secondary" function of 
breaking down the majority of the 
usual alienating barriers typical of 
such " Hollywood" parties and 
equalized everyone into a 
collective good-time spirit . 

Many guests came dressed in

Nazi officers; women were dressed 
primarily in 30's or 40's "vogue" 
complemented by occasional 
feathered finery . The crowd was an

Notes On 
The "Dominant American View" of Chile 

by Lane Kauffmann 
I recently confe~sed to a friend that I did not spend 

Sunday afternoons reading the editorial pages of the Wall 
Street lournal. I admitted this in an argument we were 
having on the interpretation of events in Chile before and 
after the coup last September. He kindly sent me an article 
called "Perspective on Chile" from the "Review and 
Outlook" section of that newspaper, dated February 8, 
1974. The article presented what it called the "dominant 
American view" on Chile. My friend thought it was "ob-
jective" and wanted to know if I thought so. In answer I 
will analyze the main points of the article and criticize the 
view which it represents, and try to bring the Chilean 
question into sharper focus . I am basing my understanding 
of events since the coup primarily on James Petras' brief (9-
page) but thorough analysis of the coup and implications 
in "Chile After Allende : A Tale of Two Coups, (Monthly 
Review, December 1973). I will ci te this and other sources 
in context. 

Our reviewer's opening passage gives us both the tone 
and the dominant themes of the art icle from 'fiS./ : " .. . the 
coup in Chile will not go down in history, despite the ef-
forts of some, as a rape of democracy perpetrated by the 
CIA and ITT. Rather , the dominant American view is that 
the deslfttetion of Chilean democracy was a tragedy, 
probably not soon to be repaired, brought about chiefly by 
President Salvador Allende and his Marxist government." 
(next paragraph :) " Now, that is not to excuse the sins of the 
present government. The junta which toppled Mr . Allende 
has made some progress in coping with the economic 
chaos it inherited; production is growing and international 
credit is better, though inflation continues .. . " 

InCidentally, preposterous as he makes it sOflnd, the rape 
thesis is not so implausible if we remember the very real 
efforts of ITT to persuade the White House to wage 
economic and diplomatic warfare against the Allende 
government. [If you are unfam iliar with the details of this 
18-point plan presented to the White House after the 
September 1971 expropriation of Chilean Telephone 
Company, urging the administration among other things to 
"Discuss with the CIA how it can assist in the six-month 
squeeze," see The New York Times, July 3, 1972; for an 
analysis see Ch . 8, "A Final Word about Neocolonialism" in 
Chile : A Historical Interpretation, by Jay Kinsbruner) . The 
next thing to be remarked about the open ing passage is 
that whereas the reviewer anticipates "the sins 'of the 
present government" he presents instead a fai r-weather 
economic report. This indicates his priorities. In his next 
brief paragraph he reports the "continuing summary 
executions and tortures charged by Amnesty International, 
which has a good track record with such charges." He 
immediately consoles us : " .. . all may not be lost. The 
Amnesty mission reported that it was well-received by the 
government .. " Etc . Rhetorically, the reviewer's prose 
works throughout t~e article either by juxtaposing false 
antitheses (e.g. " I ape of democracy" /"tragedy"), by 
substituting a virtl ,e ("economic progress") for an an-
ticipated vice ("si n! of the present government"), thereby 
excusing the sins in ;pite of himself, or by red herring facts 
and evidence (e.g. "il l may not be losl...") . I mention these 
rhetori cal abuses not to criticize his literary style but to 
suggest that he is be ng less than ob,ectiv~ . The q:J(!stinn is 
whether these abu~,'s are merely idiosyncratic or form an 
ideological pattern I will show that his argument is in-
formed not so mud' by reason as by class insti nct. 

How is rhetonc . elated to ideology in this "dominant 
American vlewl" T11$ can be shown by examining the 
reviewer's handling of the concepts of democracy and 
tragedy the concepts upon which his main thesis rests . The 
opening passage is one example; let me quote a variant. He 
cites Professor Robert J Alexander, who "Wnting for 
Freedom House .says that the destruction of democracy 
was a tragedy, but that 'Salvador Allende , martyr of th 
frustrated "Chilean Road to SOCialism," as the most im-
portant actor In the tragedy must bear the greatest blamL" 
Now in the (our~f' nf outlining the " destruct ion of 
democracy" our reviewer becomes more and I .. vr~ 
eqUivocal about wh n thiS destru tion supposedly oc-
curred. Although he wou ld like to pin It on All nd 's 

Pale 4 Triton Times, Februillry 26, 1974 

"democratic failings" he is forced to infer, as this and the 
opening passage strongly imply, that it came with the 
coup . He never makes this clear, presumably because it is 
diffi cult in the first place, if not downright embarassing, to 
explain the "necessity" of a military coup to remove a 
president elected by a democratic system and constitution 
patterned expressly after our own, with all provisions for a 
two-third majority congressional impeachment. This line of 
questioning would force our reviewer to remember (as 
Petras points out) , that it was precisely the failure of 
" legal" impeachment tactics to gain the two-third 
congressional vote in the March 1973 elections which 
caused Frei and his right-splitting faction (POC) of the 
Christian Democrats to endorse the mounting illegal efforts 
for a military takeover., sponsored by the right-
wing/ military alliance (the smaller upper-class based 
National Party plus the terrorist ultra-right Patria y 
libertad, together forming approximately 20 percent of the 
electorate) . Frei's action was a desperate attempt to insure 
himself, after the legali sti c maneuvers had failed , of some 
control over the choice of Allende's successor after the 
impending coup. Being in control of the courts and 
Congress, the CD was in a position to smoothe the 
military's path by i llegally pronouncing Allende's govern-
ment "i llegal" . Th is paradox sets up the first condition for 
understanding the events in Chile: Allende's elected 
socialist government wassystematically blocked by a class 
which remained in a posi tion to enforce its own definition 
of legality. Frei was thus used to provide a semblance of 
legitimacy to the coup, only to be discarded after the coup 
by the military-corporate alliance which settled in to 
"govern " . (For a detailed analYSis of above, precise makeup 
of current governing class and its policies, again see 
Petras) . On Frei had rested the " democrati c" hopes of 
some, including Frei , that the junta would be only a 
" caretaker" government and would promptly turn over the 
reigns to the CD. The October purge of pro-coup CD 
universi ty officials and their replacement with military shot 
down those hopes for anyone who still seriously en-
tertai ned them ; since then the "caretaker" idea, as used in 
the ~ article, has become another red herring. 

Thus, by March 1973, the alliance ,toward the coup had 
dropped all but the preten se of democratic legitimacy. This 
is the proper context for understanding Allende's alleged 
violations of democracy, such as the statement, " His 
denunciations of the Congress and the Supreme Court 
intensified fears that his party's professed commitment to 
'dictatorship of the proletariat' would outweigh his 
repeated professions of democrati c intent." The implied 
contradiction between "his party's professed commitment" 
and "his repeated professions" is rhetorically induced . 
From the history of Allende's long and disciplined climb to 
the Presidency one can assume that by 1970 the voters 
knew what Allende stood for . (Allende was among the 
founders of the original Socialist Party of Chile in 1933; he 
ran three times - 1952, 1958, 1964- for President on a left-
coalition platform . See NACLA, New Chile 1973 edition) . 

The indictment of Allende rests overtly upon the 
assumption of his "destruction of democracy" . But as we 
have seen, the rhetoric of democracy in the reviewed 
article makes nonsense out of the coup to anyone who is 
not intinctively prepared to believe his explanation . The 
~ outrage felt by those sharing the "dominant Amer ican 
view" stems not from this illusory violation of democracy 
but from another source : "His failure to uphold the right of 
private property ... " To understand the class-based nature 
of our reviewer's argument we need only translate "private 
property" for "democratic intent" wherever it occurs in the 
article . The motive for couching the class-struggle in a 
rh toric of violated democracy is ideological : it conceals 
the reviewer's class-sympathy with the coup. Moreover, it 
sounds nicer to say that Allende died for violating 
democracy than to say that he died for violating "private 
prop rty" . 

A final remark on the manipulation of the notion of 
trag dy. The "tragi " view of Chile is a historical way of 
seeing the events as a purely political drama acted out by 
one man trying to impos his will upon the people, instead 

Letters to the 
Heinzman 
Criticized 

Editor, 
I was aghast to see in the 

Feb 19 issue of the n an 
article on " Students for 
Heinnzman and Westerwick 
(SHW)". This group feels that 
the issues in Del Mar are 
crime prevention , improved 
street condition, and the 
"need for cooperation to 
protect the Del Mar en-
vironment." The way this 
group hopes to accomplish 
these goals is to re-elect 
Jani ce Heinzmann . Nothing 
could be more disastrous to 
the environment or the 
general needs of Del Mar 
than the re-election of Jan 
Heinnzman, except perhaps 
the re -election of Tom 
Pearson, but he is not run -
ning again for another two 
years. 

The SHW article, written 
by a member I suppose, 
claims that the "current 
counci I majority" is 
unresponsive to the issues 
and that students are being 
forced from Del Mar because 
of high rents, among other 
things. As one who was 
forced from Del Mar because 
of high rents, let me make a 
few comments . I attended 
many City Council meetings 

and came to know the vi 
of all the Council mf'mh .. " 
Since the n 
bureaucratic remedy is 
procrastinate, the council 
a whole seem 
unresponsive. I could 
however, no clear 
majority . There were 
views represented on 
council, each with 
champions. Dick Rypi 
and Tom Shepard led 
" environmentalist" 
Tom Pearson and 
Heinzmann were 
pathetiC to the 
development" forces. 
Silber was the swi ng 
important issues . An ana 
of the voting record, 
kept a non-scientific 
council votes for a 
months, would show 
many split votes broke 
along this Rypin 
Shepard/ Pearson-Heinz 
line. Because cou 
members seldom like to 
themselves out in the 
alone, there are very few 
votes . The votes are norm 
5-0 or 3-2 . If there is 
"council majority," Jan 
Heinzmann is more often in 
it than not and must accept 
her share of the blame for itl 
unresponsive nature . 

As far as Ms. Heinz 
voting record is concern 
is anything but 
She has consistantly 
for or given strong 

of as an open class struggle. Thus, it sees the tragic error in 
the hubris of the leading actor, and implies that the 
significance of the events terminates in the "hero's death"-
in this case, Allende. The play is not over . The lessons of 
Chile are neither determined nor exhausted by any 
suspicions about or " refutations" of the possibility of direct 
U.S. involvement in the coup . The real intentions of the 
actors and the real lines of involvement are unfolding 
before us now. Writing in December, Petras places the 
" economic progress" of the junta in perspective : " The 
'Brazilian M odel' is being projected in Chile over the 
corpses of 20,000 workers: salaries and wages are being 
effectively lowered , prices increased, currency devalued, 
enterprises returned to private owners, and the conditions 
created for externally induced expansion at the cost of the 
poor. In the near future, the middle class, business groups, 
and industrialists will suffer the invasion of large-scale 
foreign capital wh ich, in the name of efficiency, will 
eliminate many of those who supported the coup." 

Whether the Wall Street lournal article gives a true 
picture of the "dominant American view" I leave for the 
reader to decide. It clearly represents the view of the 
dominant American class.

Editor, 

Black 
Separatism 
at UCSD 

The concept of Blackl 
Separatism at the University 
of California at San Diego 
would probably disgust and 
intimidate numerous people. 
Yet attempts to disregard this 
concept are impossible 
because Black Separatism 
frequently manifests itself on 
the UCSD campus. During 
daily meals, Blacks tend to 
congregate together, 
ostracizing their white 

counterparts. This exem-
plifies Black Unity but it also 
indicates an enormous lack 
of communication between 
Blacks and Whites . In classes 
Blacks are situated in one 
large group or several small 
groups-still another sign of 
Black Unity. 

White orientated activities 
are the reason for creating 
separate Black activities . The 
number of Black movies is an 
unfair representation of the 
total Black population at 
UCSD. The few Black movies 
that are shown is not 
necessarily the type of 
movies the majority of Black 
students would like to see . 
The type of Black movies 

Trigger F'rearm. • 
Look what a gun can do for you : 

shown such as Sounder, Lady 
Sings the Blues and the 
Learning Tree portrays Blacks 
in a stereotyped mM"ler. The 
popularity of these movies in 
white society further 
strengthens thi s stereotype. 
However, such movies as 
Warm December, Buck and 
the Preacher and the Spook 
Who Sat By the Door do not 
represent thi s stereo type . 
Rather , these mov ies 
represent digressions from 
the stereotypes placed upon 
Blacks and other minorities. 
Yet, these movies are not 
shown on ca mpus . This 
i nconsideration shown to 
Blacks and other minority 
groups regarding other socia l 

by M. Yiddischemama 

activities also indicates a 
racial misrepresentation . 

One might tend to think 
that there is no reason for 
Blacks to isolate themselves. 
But as Reverend Jesse 
Jackson says "We're already 
separate, and Blacks didn't 
do the separating ." White 
racism underlies the 
separat ing of the Blacks from 
the Wh ites and encourages 
Black solidarity. Raci sm is 
not an overt issue on campus 
but Blacks and Whites would 
have to be blind to pretend it 
does not exist. 

Group identity also brings 
Blacks closer together and 
farther apart from Whites. 
Most Blacks identify with 

each other because they feel 
more security. The cultural 
and social background which 
Blacks share encourages 
them to identify with those 
of similiar backgrounds , 
mainly Blacks In my opinion 
separatism of the races will 
not ameliorate the lack of 
commu ni cation between 
Blacks and Whites We. as 
humans must strive for 
everlasting equality and 
better communication Vet as 
long as racism and 
misrepresentation of Blacks 
continue to occur, Black 
Separatism will continue to 
grow for the purpose of Unrty 
and Security.

1M Karate Tourney 
to be Held Saturday 
The UCSD and San Diego 

Karate Clubs will hold the 
Second Quarterly I n-
tramural and Interclub 
karate tournament on Sat. , 
March 2, on the main floor, 
UCSD gym . 

Competition wi II begin at 
1:00 p.m. There is no ad-
mission or participation fee. 
There wi II be demon-
strations and competition 
in six events. The events 
will be in Kumite (Sparring) 
and Kata (Forms). 

Immediately after the 

tournament, an Asian Style 
Potluck Party will be held at 
the International Center for 
contestants, and UCSD and 
San Diego Karate Club 
members. 

Contestants must report 
between noon and 1:00 
p.m. for registration and 
instructions. To qualify, a 
contestant must be a 
regular or ext;;nsion Ur.SD 
student! faculty/ staff 
(UCSD ID required) or a San 
Diego Karate Club member. 

Cager's Comeback 
Comes Up Short 
Displ,lying a rare second 

half comeback, the UCSD 
basketball team nearly 
upset USIU . Coming from a 
ten point halftime deficit, 
the Tritons blew a couple of 
golden opportunities to pull 
even with the Westerners 
and went down to defeat by 
the score of 61-57. 

The last 6'h minutes had 
the crowd yelling without 
stopping as the Tritons 
made a strong run at USIU . 
With four minutes 
remaining in the game 
George Calhoun hit two 
free throws to pull the 
Tritons within two points. 
After USIU scored Joe Coit 
responded with a ten foot 
jumper from the base line 
to again narrow the gap to 
two. 

At that point USIU went 
into a stall, forCing -UCSD to 
foul in order to get the ball 
back. Twice the strategy 
worked as the USIU players 
missed free throws . On one 
occassion (with 51 seconds 
left) Steve Higgins was 
fouled, but he missed the 
first of a one~>n-one foul 
situation . Then with 8 
seconds remaining Joe Coit 
made a brilliant move on 
his man only to miss a 5 
foot bank shot. USIU's R.J. 
Kunysz then put the game 
away with 6 seconds left as 
he calmly sank two free 
throws . 

The game was actually 
decided in the first half as 
USIU raced off to a ten 
point halftime lead by 
constantly beating the 
UCSD " Who's my man, man 
to man defens£-,' for easy 
lay ins . R.J. Kun'ISl was the 

big man for USIU in the first 
half as he dominated the 
boards while pouring in ten 
points . He finished with a 
game high 10 rebounds 
along with his 16 points. 

It was also one of those 
nights where everything 
USIU threw towards the 
basket went in, while 
everything UCSD tried seem 
to roll off the rim . One had 
the feeling UCSD was 
playing against one of the 
bible colleges on Sunday 
morning as thE: ' just 
couldn't get any good 
bounces. 

Paul Trainer led the 
Tritons with 18 points and 8 
rebounds with Joe Coit 
contributing 13 points 
along with another 8 
rebounds. George Calhoun 
also played a fine game as 
he scored 12 points and 
gathered in 5 rebounds . 
Other people scoring for 
UCSD were Steve Kircher 6 
points, and Mark Read and 
Steve Higgins with 4 points 
apiece. 

The USIU game marked 
the end of the season for 
the Tritons. They finished 
the season with a 13-11 
record overall . In league 
play they finished either in 
second or third place 
depending on the outcome 
of the Westmont-Fresno 
Pacific game. Their league 
record was 7-3, but could 
have been better as they 
lost two of the games by 3 
points or less . 

Needless to say Coach 
Bill Reeves is looking to 
next year as all members of 
the team . except Steve 
Higgins will be returning.

Yes, There Is A Track Team, 
And It's Challenging Students 

Althoulh third place in 
the mi;ewas a slow 4:50, no 
UCSD team members were 
left over to compete in this 
event. However, the teams 
resident track fanatic, 
SuperStrebel, waJ em-
ployed as a rabbit, finishmg 
a non-scoring third in the 
100 and a second in the 220, 
even though he spotted the 
rest of the competition the 
advantage of starting 
blocks. 

The UCSD Track Team, 
after a semi-victory in 
Saturday's tri-meet on our 
own Matthews Campus 
Track Facility, decided that 
they are finally ready to 
take on the student body at 
large_ 

Coach Andy Skief and his 
12 diSCiples , having 
compiled a fantastic 1-1 
record, all in one day, are 
confident that their athletic 
prowess can vanquish all 
opponents. 

Therefore, be it here 
known that they issue a 
challenge to all students of 
UCSD (male, female, ms. or 
neuter; no dogs please) to 
compete against them in a 
series of varied and unusual 
running events on Saturday, 
the 9th of March, in this 
year of our Lord, 1974. 

How can this be? The 
very nerve! The students of 
UCSD are well known to be 
invincible - - each being a 
superior competitor who 
has forsaken athletics so as 
not to embarrass those of 
lesser ability. 

Why, their reserves are 
nearly infinite, and they are 
known to harbor in their 
midst potential olympic 
medalists who have 
deliberately abandoned 
thei r talents for the higher 
calling of academic ex-
cellence. 

All this against 12 skinny 
guys in gym shortsr In-
credible! But wait, there 
may be something to this .. 

On Saturday these 12 
guys put out superhuman 
efforts to score 43 points in 
competition against Cal 
Lutheran College and La 
Verne College. 

Cal Lutheran, employing 
hordes of undisciplined 
behemoths (i .e. a large 
number, greater than 12) 
simply picked up all the 
garbage points, which when 
added up by their manager, 
a UCSD Math dropout, 
totaled 111. 

The UCSD trackmen 
expressed the opinion that 
this narrow margin of 
victory was really quite 
insignificant, citing La 
Verne's score of a mere 22 
points. 

The premier performance 
leading to these en-
couraging results was 
rendered by Skip Denny, 
who won both the shot put 
and discus. His effort of 46 
feet 8 Y. inches in the shot 
put set a new school record. 

Bill Hayes, second, and 
Ian Roth, fourth, combined 
with Denny to give the 
Tritons an impressive 
showing in the discus.

and UCSD, managed to get 
into the scoring binge with 
a third in the shot. He also 
added a strong leg to the 
mile relay team . 

Both the mile relay 
(Scott, Roth, Barker, Longo) 
and the 440 relay (Hen-
dricks, Byers, Longo, 
Heberstruh) placed second, 
without any prior practice. 

Altogether, the sprinters 
had a good day, with 
second and fifth in the 100 
yard dash (Eric Hendricks, 
Mike Byers), second in the 
220 (Hendricks) and a 
second in the 440 (Frank 
Longo). 

Frank ' s time of 52 .5 
seconds was excellent for 
the track conditions, and 
only slightly more than a 
second off the school 
record. 

Another outstanding 
performance was turned in 
by Page Smith, who 
claimed first in the triple 
jump with a very good early 
season mark of 42 feet 6 y, 
inches. In his spare time, 
Page also placed fourth in 
the high jump. 

The scoring was rounded 
out by Paul HeberstrJh 
(fourth; 120 yard high 
hurdles), Pete Barker (third, 
440 yard intermediate 
hurdles; third 880 yard run) 
and Campbell (fourth, three 
mile run). 

This, then, is the not so 
motley crew that has 
challenged the honor of 
UCSD. The spectacu lar 
events which will decide 
the victor by mortal combat 
are tentatively scheduled 
as : 

SKIP DENNY: ace shot

Science Synopsis 

UC's Sea Grant 
The University of California was given Sea Grant 

status in October of last year. J. D . Frautschy, program 
manager, has now called for a new emphasis on 
planning commensurate with UC's resulting leadership 
responsibility . 

Sea Grant Colleges are designated under the seven'-
year - old federal Sea Grant section of the Marine 
Resources and Development Act from among in-
stitutions of higher education already receiving grant 
support which have demonstrated an existing broad 
base of competence in marine affairs. 

To qualify for institutional support, which precedes 
but does not guarantee Sea Grant College status, an 
Institution must make a "positive, long-range com-
mitment" to Sea Grant objectives by pledging its 
resources in the form of matching funds ; creation of a 
structure to administer a Sea Grant program; establish-
ment of interdisciplinary research teams; and 
development of advisory services mechanisms for 
"strong interaction with marine communities" in its 
region. 

The Sea Grant College designation is based on 
"quality, quantity and productivity of performance" by 
an institution in research, education and advisory

Science Panacea 
Despite a supposed prevalence of anti-science and 

technology sentiment in the U. S. today, a pool taken by 
the Opinion Research Corporation of Princeton, New 
Jersey, has indicated that Americans still hold scientific 
achievement in high regard . 

The poll interviewed a representative sample of 2,000 
adults, and though it was generally accepted that 
science and technology has had both good and bad 
effects, 54% felt the good outweighs the bad as op-
posed to 4% who felt the opposite. Advances in ' 
medicine, space exploration, atomic research and 
improving the environments were cited as major recent 
benefits. 

Only 70% felt that science has improved their lives, 
though a majority believe that science and technology 
can solve most of some or most of our present 
problems. They felt that scientific funds should" be 
directed toward social problems such as health, 
education, drug contro l and crime prevention. Space 
exploration rated lowest on the list of priorities. 

Human Insulin From Pigs 
A ~'non-human" source for human insulin 'that may 

prOVide the 5 to 6' million diabetics in the United States 
a far superior treatment for their disease than has ever 
been available has been developed by U.c. San Diego 
biochemist, Dr. Michael A. Ruttenberg. 

Because the diabetic's body does not produce an 
adequate supply of insulin, the traditional treatment has 
been to supplement this inadequacy with insulin 
derived from beef or pigs . Animal-derived insulin, 
however, differs slightly in structure from natural 
human insulin causing many diabetics to develop 
moderate to severe immune-reactions. 

The reaction necessitates continuously increased 
insulin dosages and may also be the cause of the 
devastating side-effects of diabetes - blindness, blood 
vessel disease and kidney malfunction. 

Dr . Ruttenberg has successfully produced "human" 
insulin by removing the single segment in porcine in-
sulin that differentiates it from human and replacing it 
with a synthetic substitute. The resulting insulin is 
structurally identical to human insulin and has been 
found to perform exactly like natural human insulin . 

The availability of human insulin is especially im-

services; cooperation with a service to marine com-
munities; and the "efficiency and competence" of its 
central Se~ Grant administrative structure. 

In its upcoming '74-'75 budget which will be sub-
mitted to the National Sea Grant Office in Washington, 
UCSG is requesting S3O,OOO for a stat~wide program 
planning and development effort , a 200% increase over 
the current planning budget. 

"This increased effort," said Frautschy, " is designed to 
ensure that the contributions of the University and 
affiliated institutions to the wise utilization and con-
servation of marine resources continue to be of 
maximum public benefit to the state and the nation ." 

Lazered Hearts 
A 5200,000, three-year 

research grant has been 
awarded to Dr. Michael W. 
Berns, associate professor 
of biological sciences at 
UCI, for the study of heart 
functions with lasers. Dr. 
Berns is one of the scientists 
who adapted the laser to 
use in biomedical research 
and surgery. 

The grant, awarded by 
the National Heart and 
Lung I nstitute, will support 
Berns' continuing research 
in the causes of one of the 
major disorders in heart 
disease. 

"The research involves 
placing living heart tissue 
taken from a rat in an ar-
tificial culture environment 
and exposing the living, 
beating cells to a laser 
beam," Berns said . "By 
focusing a pencil-thin shaft 
of laser light into a single 
contracting heart cell, it is 
possible to bring about a 
variety of changes in the 

"In addition, com-
bination of the laser ap-
proach with various drug 
treatments could result in 
the development of new 
methods of treatment of 
contractile heart disorders." 

Vice chairman of 
the Department of 
Developmental and Cell 
Biology at UCI , Berns also is 
pursuing a second major 
area of biomedical research 
involving cell heredity and 
regulation. This research is 
supported by an 580,000 
grant from the National 
Science Foundation . 

"This is a more basic area 
of research involving the 
application of the laser to 
genetic engineering ." he 
said . "One of the major 
objectives is to selectively 
alter and remove specific 

chromosome~ and genes 
containing the hereditary 
information from individual 
cells in culture. 

portant In the treatment of Juvenile-<lnset dlabet s 
occurring in children and adolescents The seventy of 
this disease and its side-effects are greater than In adult-
onset diabetes. However, many of these seriou~ 
complications may be eliminated by using what may 
now be a readily available source of "human" insulin 

Researchers have found that it is al~o possible to 
produce a fully-synthetic insulin, but, as Dr. Ruttenberg 
explained, " this starting - from - scratch process is ex-
tremely difficult because the insulin protein involves a 
complicated sequence of 51 amino acids In two dif-
ferent chains coupled together . The type of chemical 
synthesis required to duplicate the chains is in no way 
practical for large-scale and ine~pensive production of 
insulin ." 

If Dr. Ruttenberg's process could be adapted to an 
industrial level, a continuing supply of "human" insulin 
for the 325,000 additional diabetics discovered in the 
United States each year could also be ensured. Last year 
diabetes was also a major cause of heart attacks, the 
second-highest cause of blindness and the fifth-leading 
cause of death by disease in this country.

Scientists, shutterbugs and nature enthusiasts can 

view a gallery of underwater photography during a 
memorial exhibition of works by the late Ron Church, 
who was recognized by his colleagues as one of the 
world's foremost underwater photographers and ex-
ploring divers. 

Through March the Vaughan Aquarium-Musum at 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of 
California, San Diego, will present a panorama of 
Church 's underwater photography utilizing film , more 
than 200 photographs and color slides of marine life, 
and displays of black coral and ocean artifacts. 

Church , undersea photographer for more than 20 
years, photographed in nearly all the world's oceans, 
and received many honors, including the highest formal 
recognition given an underwater photographer by his 
'leers, the International Underwater Photographer of 
(he Year in 1%3. 

........................ cell's ability to contract 
normally. 

"This approach is being 
used to elucidate basic 
mechanisms of heredity 
and gene expression in 
normal cells as well as in 
cancer cells," he said. "An 
understanding of how 
cancer cells are different 
from normal cells is 
necesYary in the 
development of new ap-
proaches in the conquest of 
cancer ." 

Prior to his death last October from a brain tumor, 
Church had completed a three-year assignment for 
Jacques-Yves Cousteau. He was the only American 
member of the Cousteau Calypso team of diver/-
photographf'rs working on the Cousteau television 
series, films and books. While "shooting" for Cousteau , 
Church had many opportunities for travel and rare 
diving experiences, including work undel Alaska ice 
and 350-foot dives for red coral off Corsica.

Cousteau has said, "Church's mission to vastly expand 
the photographic coverage in the sea is important, 
perhaps crucial. Remember, underwater photography is 
the public's only vieh of the undersea world and the 
principal link of affection ; and, ultimately, public 
opinion will determine the fate of the oceans we love."
