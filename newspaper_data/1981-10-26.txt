Law School Grads: 
the crab connection 

Tom always dreamed of saving the world. Top in his class at 
Yale Law, chool, "Mr. Altruism" had planned to use his legal 
education and a superior intellect to "reduce human suffering." 

Like so many of America's sharpest law graduates. however, 
Tom isn't forcing chemical companies to dean up their IOxic-
waste sit s. Instead, he's ear111 ng $14.000 per year as a first ·year 
associa t e at one I)f Ne\\ York's leading corporal e law firms.

The con game begins al the 'ilart of a st udent 's second year. 
[n a recent survey of summer interns at prominent law firms , 

The American Lawyers magazine reported that, in addition to 
$800-per-wcek salaries, many second-year law st udents have 
enjoyed the following: 

*Offers by one New York firm to pick up the tab for five 
"fantasy nights" on the lown. 

*Summer-rental subsidies of up to 75 percenl from another 
New York firm . 

*Nightly outdoor concens and week ly part ies. Last 
summer. one Atlanta firm threw one bash touted as a "Orivin'. 
Raftin '. lIikin·. Swimmin'. Ball-Playin', Ridin', Cookin' . Eatin' ,

Mentber attacks AS Council 
Editor: 

I am writingtoyou 10 \(licemyconc rnsasan 
AS officer and above all else. a~ a fellow st udenl. 

A~ a member of st udent government I see where 
student monies are being spent. [ see 6 percent 
of the st uden I budget goi ng to one organizat ion 
while ot hers get cut in half. I see 7 percent of I he 
budget as a proposed stipend going to t\ 
council members. I see ~800.(XJO trip!-, 10 
Washington D.C. to visit sororit ies. All in all [ 
sec a lot of \\ asted money: monc, I hat i" 
SUPlxlsed to be spent on the st uden Is at UC: D. 

I don't know about you. bUI I am prell y upset. 
Like you. I pay a mandalory amounl of $n.OO a 
quarler ($8.00 start ing Winter ). I can't expect 
that money to be used in a wise, knowl xIgable 
fashion to increase <;tudent interest and 
participation on 'ampus . Or can I? 

Earlier in the year. an organization called the 
Committee for World Democracy (CWO) 
received $12.500 (6 percent of the budget ) 10 
show free political films every v.;eek. The 
organi7ation in itself is commendable. 'ome of 
their weekly movies have even drawn upwards 
of 300-400 people. But the way CWO is funded 
and the amount that it receives is an outrage to 
other student orgs., especially those that 
represent more students yet receive less 
funding. 

As Activity Fee Chairman. my job is to fund 
st udent organizations wit h a limit ed budget. 
The. ·2.(Xhtudent increase I hat t he AS recei\ed 
was originall y meant to impro\'e I he condition s 
of 'itudent orgs. BUI since CWi) ha!'\ rl'ce i\ ed a 
flat $12.:>00 ($l(),()OO more than Ihl' neare..,t 
org.), t ht' resl of the flft \ or so funded ~Iudl'nl

part of the council. 

Far be it from the cound. ho\\e\er, to s top 
Ihis ridiculousness so soon. Now Ihe AS has 
come (Jut wit h a rash of boycotts t hat IS sending 
the IXllit ical and economic world inlo turmoil. 
(Or so they woulcllike to think). ln acl uality . t h 
people out raged al the boy cot ts are not Coors or 
Nestle's or even Dr. Atkinson, but rather the 
students on campus that don't enjoy being told 
what I h y can or can not boycot t. 

The oors boycott has already had some 
harmful effects. The Rec Club had Coors 
sponsoring for the Oktob rfest until the AS 
Council. in all its wisdom. persuaded Ihe Rec 
Club to drop Coor" as a s Jxmsor and receive full 
funding from t he AS. This costt he counci l (you 
and I) over a thousand dollars t hat could have 
lX'en spen t elst'where if t here was no boycot t. 

The Nestl .~ boycott is cosling us also. O\'er 
$&I.(X) of (I/( I' money is being spend on flyers 
ad\'(X'at ing Ihe boycolt. It is bad enough when 
the AS start" lelling us how to think but when 
Ihey slarl spending "Iudenl money 10 satisfy 
Ihl'lr o\\'n IXllitical n eds, then they\'l' gone too 
far . 

The boycot t of I he Ch£ln<.:ellor's inaugural iun 
lells the same story. If we \\'ant to get along 
wilh admi ni s tralion we must be prep;lred to 
peacefully si l down and discu"s issu '".

students as well. 

The AS has overstepped it s boundaries on 
each one of I hese boycotts. To inform sludents 
of the hiring practices of Coors, the business 
pract ices of Neslle and t he lack of student input 
when picking a chancellor is one t hmg. but to 
make a campus-wide annuuncement that the 
AS as a REPRESENTATIVE of Ihe student 
bod~. is boycotting Coors (or eslle. etc.1 i.., 
anothl'r thing altogether. It is simply not 
apprl'cial ed. 

Another thi ng thaI is hard toswalll1w,111uch 
Ie ... .., apprcciate. is Ihe way In which certain 
cou ncil members slX'nd student funds . The AS 
Presidenl received <1. ' a matter of personal 
discret ion , $1.000 over the summer to be spent 
in \\'avs that he "al\' fil 10 further the inlerests 
and goals of Ihe student body. Apparently, he 
felt it was necessa ry 10 spend over $100.00 to 
buy pictures for the AS conference room. a 
much needed expendit ure if I've ever seen one. 

BUI that's only the beginning. As students we 
also paid for t he AS president to fly to 
Washington D.C. to attend a sorority function . 
You almo 'l have to laugh when you think of it. I 
realize that sororities are a big thing here at 
lJCSD, but not big enough to spend over $800.00 
to fly to Washington D.C.? That's our money 
he 's spending and personally I'd rather see ilgo 
to somet hing a little more useful to the st udenl 
body. 

'[<0 top it all off. he took it upon himself to sl ay 
in ,:·50.0() a night hotels ami he even found the 
time to slOp off in Wi sconsin on the wa" home. 
,\1 "'0. he feels a r('lx)rt to the cou ncil a nd 10 thl'

To til' the package up nice and neat . the 
cou ncil \'oted 10 reimburse the president for all 
his sum111er expenditures. including the eighty-
plus dollars that he l'XC cd d on his travel 
budget. One council member suggested that we 
reimburse the president because it would build 
a more "~t mng and decent" AS. How can we . 
th AS. become stronger and more decent when 
we are involved with s uch gross 
misappropiations of funds? If we really want to 
become unified and grow. we ha ve 10 start 
Ihinking about how the s tudent body will react 
10 decisions I hat we make. 

Which brings us to the new proposal of 
slipends. In a time when the AS and student 
body are light -years apart, such a proposal 
could only sepa rate us furt her. The concept of 
some I<inc! of compensation such as academic 
cr('d il s. elc., is va lid . However, to vote outselves 
money (.·1 5,OOOor7percenl ofthebudget)when 
we are turning down st udent orgs. with Ihl' 
exclise of lacking fund~, is ludricrous and 
inexcusable.

Saudi -Arabia does not 
warrant US attention 
Editur: 

It is an ou trage to thin k thaI 
Mr. Paul McCloskey Jr . 
(G uardian, Oct . 15) can 
pub lis h . u c h del i be rat e 
distortions and outright 
myths in a UC newspaper. 
Having recently returned from 
a year of study in Israel. I am 
deeply concerned about the 
proliferation of this mis lead-
ing propaganda. 

Mr. McCloskey informs u 
that "The only possible place 
for a Palestinian homeland is 
on the West Bank and in 
Gaza." Let U ' set the record 
straight. Palest ine was a term 
u 'ed in the British Mandate 
period to loosely descri be I he 
entire region from the 
Mediterranean Sea stretching 
through Jordan and until Iraq. 
The relatively small area of 
what is presently know n as 
the West Bank never held any 
exclusive Oewi sh or Arab) 
nat ional significance. Tuday. 
most Palest inian Arabs live in 
Jordan, and conversely . most 
Jordanians are Palestinian . 
Palestinians have also lived in 
Syria. Lebanon, and t he area of 
Israel Proper for centurie~. 

obody denies that duringlhe 
1948 War. many Pa lesl in ian 
A rabs (a nd Israelis ) \\'ere 
displaced from their homes. 
but t he idea of creat ing a //( ' /f ' 
"Palestinian homeland" on 
t he West Bank and Gaza is 
simply erroneou~. 

In acldit ion , il i!'\ imJxlrl ant 
for people to know thaI the 

Arabs living in th e areas 
captured by [srael in the 1967 
War enjoy more security and 
civil libert ies t han the rest of 
the Arab world. Military 
occupat ion is never nice, and 
personally I clo not belie, e it 
s hould be the permanent 
governmental st ruct ure of 
these areas. but the truth is 
that the Israelis have made it 
tolerable. De:-pil l' Mr . 
McCloskey's misinfor"1 al if 'n . 
Arabs are, by law, free' to pa"S 
fromlordan, through the West 
Bank, and into holy sites in 
Jerusalem virtually at will. 

Mr. McCloskey would have 
us believe that Saudi Arabia is 
unconditionally, for better or 
for worse, committed to the 
rights of their Palestinian 
but let's open our eyes. Where 
was the Saudi support for the 
Palestinians before June 1967? 
Palestinians before June 1967? 
To date, the only legitimate. 
diplomatic development 
towards peace and a last ing 
solution to the Pale tinian 
quest ion was the signi ng of the 
Camp David Accords. The 
unilaterial rejection of the 
peace pr c :-;s begun at Camp 
David by the Saudi regime, 
and t heir periodical call for 
jihad (holy war) again"t the 
, tale of [sra I should gi\e a 
due to the Palestinian People 
(and US foreign policy makers) 
as to the audi government's 
concern for peace in t he region. 

It is no secret t hat ~ audi 

Arabia is the major financial 
arm of the PLO. Perhaps Mr. 
McCloskey shou ld read a 
do c ument ca lled "The 
Palesti'lian National Cove-
nant ," endor 'ed by Yassir 
Arafat, in which Jewi sh 
nationality and right to 
political sovereignty, regar~­
less of borders, are unequI-
vocally rejected . If t his is 
really Saudi Arabia' · po 'ition 
(recent off-the-record gestures 
by Saudi officials give me no 
reason to believe otherwise), 
the discus 'ion is ended. The 
State of Israel's right to 
existence will not be an item 
open for negotiation . 

Regarding Saudi Arabia ,; 
"nat ural alliance wit h the 
United States," we must not 
be fooled. There are ·tillthose 
of U ' who are grateful to the 
Saudis for keeping oi l prices 
below that of OPEC. However, 
if one takes a closer look, it 
becomes clear that audi 
Arabia's "moderate" oil prices 
were conveniently placed just 
below the level t hat would 
have made it advantageou" for 
the United States to develop 
alternate energy source-,. 

In short . the audi regime 
simpl y has not prO\'en It'ielf to 
be a re:-qxlOsible or reliabll' 
government for the unre-
slrlcted operatIOn of the 
United States' 1ll0"t soplm;ti, 
cal ed weaponry.

Commuter problems 
Editor: 

The fall Sf'n1ester has Ix>gan 
and many student" probably 
have many problem.., and 
co mpl a int s they want 
resolved . ' tudents lidng in 
dorms probably com plain 
about their room mat eb or 
about the cafetena food. The 
biggest complaint from 
commuters is that they have a 
hard time making friend s at 
school. 

I commute to school 
everyday . Before I came here, I 
heard that commuters had a 
tough time making fri ends. I 
thought - "sure you can; no 
problem." I thought that you 
could meet people in your 
classes. But flam my 
experience you can not. When 
you're in cia ·S. you don't have 
time to talk or gossip With 
people. You're too busy taking 
notes on the profe ssor's 
lecture. The couple of minutes 
before class i . not enough, and 
once class i ' over, everybody 
scatters their own ways -
either going to their next cia:; . 
going home. meeting other 
friends, etc. 

, 0 it's really hard to meet 
people in school except during 
your breaks, but the problem 
of shyness come in. You just 
don't gu up to people and start 
talking 10 them huping to 
make friends with them. 
(That \ a little tuo fOr\\ard). 

Dorm people seem to hang 
around together in groups or 

palr~. [t'!'\ hard for the 
commuter to fit In becaw .. e 
the\' feel like Ihe\ don't 
"belong." as a . fellow 
commuter sa\'s. 

[ have friends who li\'e 10 

dorm~ and off campu,", 
apartment..,. They tell me that 
e\ en-one in t heir sUite are very 
c1o,",e. Thev are all "good 
buddies" and can get along 
very well One time when [ 
went to visit her, the other 
people in h~r suite ... ee~ed 
ho-,tile to me. They acted like 
they didn't care about 
knowing me becam,e they 
figured that they probably 
wouldn't see me again 
anyways, <;ince I don't live 
there. 

It seems like the people who 
make the most friends are 
those who live in dorms or 
apartment<;. These people live

Commuters have a hard time 
getting to know people because 
they have to go home after 
school. A friend I know aid 
that last year in college she 
lived at home, and it was really 
hard for her to make friends. 
But this year she lives in an 
off-campu!'\ apart ment and hao., 
made a lot of friend . 

When [went to orientation, I 
(and other commuters who 
wanted to participate in form 
activities) were as..,ured that 
we would be Informed of any 
dorm acti'lties. I ha\e not 
heard about any act i\'ity yet.

Hollingsworth on nuke war 

BY JOE FALLETTA 
For Dr . J. William 

Hollingsworth of UCSD Lhe 
trut h is clear, the answer 
simple. Nuclear war, even the 
limited LIse of nuclear 
weapons, is unspeakable. II 
sim ply is not an option. 

"Nuclear war is just not 
feasible. There is no is 'ue that 
big." the medical director of 
the Veterans Administration 
Medical Center and vice 
chairma n of the UCSD 
Department of Medicine told 
The Guardian recently. "War 
is no longer a way to solve a 
problem." 

While that point is obvious 
Lo him. he admits he was 
surprised to learn the belief is 
not shared by all. 

"You open your ears and 
listen and suddenly you realize 
senior members of thi 
government really believe 
these weapons could be used." 
Hollingsworth said . "It is 
incredible that our govern-
ment conLinues to make noises 
like that." 

Hollingsworth's first 
realization regarding the 
government's willingness to 
use nuclear weapons came 
while listening to Dr. Howard 
Hiatt, the dean of the Harvard 
l niversity chool of Public 
Health , speak on the subject of 

nuclear war. Hollingswort h 
recounts he was surpri sed to 
hear Hiat L point out there is no 
winning a nuclear war; a 
nuclear war would destroy all 
civi li zation. 

Holling 'worth says he 
realized that noL all were as 
cognizant as he when an old 
friend urged him to take notice 
of recent statements coming 
from the White Hou se 
regarding possibilities of 
winning a limited nuclear war. 
Although he never considered 
himself a poliLical activist . he 
decided then that he should 
speak out and that physicians 
could playa role in t he issue of 
nuclear war. 

"May people don't realize 
how many people will die -
how miserably they will die," 
HollingsworLh sa id . "They 
don't realize what they are 
dealing with. 

"Nuclear war has been 
talked about in the abstract for 
so long, people need to be 
brought toreality; to say. 'Hey. 
what arc we thinking of?' " 

Hollingsworth studied the 
physiological effects of the 
atomic bombs dropped on 
Nagasak i and Hiroshima. In 
the on-going s tudy, the 
Japanese peopl reported every 
two years O\'er 25 to 30 years 
for examination. Also. from 

1958 to 1960 he studied victims 
to find out if radiation 
accelerated the aging process. 
He says no evidence was found 
to support the hypothesis. 

In an atomic explosion the 
above ground blast tears 
things apart. The human body 
is torn apart; the lungs and 
heart collapse, said Hollings-
worth. 

Anything in the path of the 
blast becomes a weapon. A 
bench, for example. would 
splinter with each chunk 
flying off and becoming a 
project i Ie. 

The blast is followed by 
intense heat and radiation. 
During hydrogen bomb tests 
in the atmosphere during the 
1950s. persons 300 to 400 miles 
away weI' burned and crops 
ruined. said Hollingsworth . 

Radiation deat h takes t woor 
thr e days depending on Lhe 
degree uf exposure to the 
radiation . The bone marrow 
and the gastro-intestinal tract 
are destroyed. resulting in 
massi\'e inLernal bleeding and 
diarrhea. 

The effects are more 
horrifying when one realize ' 
that huspitals are dest royed, 
the staff killed or wounded . 
With drugs. tools and doctors 
una\'ailahle there is no way to

('one pts,a ... ound nogrouphad

single " Roxanne ," With ils 
'itriking vocals and heavy 
undertones, set the pace for 
the rest of the album. 

The group relea~ed one 
album in both ]979 and 1980. 
Each album became more 
popular than the last, making 
the Police superstars in this 
country by 1980. The problem 
I had with the band'.; success 
is that it made the group and 
their rec()rd~ e\'en more popi..,h 
than before. 

Ghost [II The .\l(l C lillie 
makes me a Police fan once 
again. Inslead of extending 
their hold on the pop audience. 
the group has put out an 
;jlbum of surpri!'ilngly 

different and good material. 
Reggae music was a heavy 

influence on the Police in their

have lost those roots on the 
two subsequent album ' but

SDSU finds 
Hawaii tough 

Men's water polo defeated 

BY BOB Mc PADDEN 
Spurts Ed it or 

The San Diego State Aztecs 
put a lot on t he gridiron 
Sat urday night in an Diego 
Jack Murphy Stadium, a lot in 
the way of a 4·1 record, a 
chance to bounce back from a 
27-7 defeat the week earlier at 
the hands of BYU, and a 
chance to lock the Western 
At hletic Conference into a 
three way tie for first place. 
Theonly problem was that the 
University of Hawaii got in the 
way of t he Aztec ' chances, 
upping their own record to -0 
with a 28-10 win. 

Ha waii I yard line. However, 
on three running plays the 
Aztecs were denied paydirt, 
and a 23 yard field goal by 
Meyer gave State a 3·0 
advantage. 

On the next possession fur 
Hawaii the Rainbows 
displayed an outstanding 
array of passes and rushing, I 
driving to the SDSU one yard 
line before David Toloumu 
burst through for the nights 
first touchdown. 

BY TIM PICKWELL 
Slall Writer 

All the little missed 
opportunities in Sunday's 6-4 
water polo loss may add up to 
onc big miss for the UCSD 
Tritons. 

A victory over the number 
three-ranked UCLA Bruins 
yesterday would have put San 
Diego's foot in the NCAA 
Tournament door. 

Instead, the Tritons were 
unable to take advantage of 
several offensive openings and 
now the playoff door will be 
harder to slip through. 

"The critical difference in 
the game." Coach Denny 
Harper observe '. "was t hat we 
didn't capitalize on their 
mistakes. We were unable to 
convert six-on-five. man-up 
situation '." 

Division III mem ber. San 
Diego, was ranked in the 
NCAA top 10 before the 

weekend. but also lost to (IC 
In'ine 8·5 aturday and the 
team record is now 12-9-2. to 
ha\'e a chance for the NCAA 
tourney. Harper feels his team 
will have to defeat the 
remaining powers on the 
schedu Ie . The list include" 
Long Beach, UC RIverSIde and, 
on the last home date of the 
season. Cal State Fullerton. 

The contest Sunday. which 
Harper described last' week as 
one of the most important in 
San Diego water polo history. 
att racted t he largest crowd of 
the season. Th spectators, 
including Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson. braved Miramar 
Road traffic lights to witness 
the closest game yet at the 30-
meter a\'al AIr Station pool. 

They saw the Tritons fall 
behind 2-0 before Toby 
Raymond put in the first 
Triton shot. Then. a half-
minut e before half -t i me. 

Mouse ~1arb _ nuck through 
the Los Angeles defense to tie 
the ..,core. 

All afternoon (,CLA pres~ed 
the San DIego offense to the 
penmeter of the pool. The 
Triton.., had "ery fe\~ ..,conng 
chances. 

They dId mc)\e ahead . 
ho"'e\ cr. when Marks took the 
ball. sl ipped a defender 111 front 
of the goal. double·pumped. 
and pushed t he ball bet ween 
the Bruin goalIe'" arm. 

T\\ enty seconds later. a 
l'CLA player, faced \\ ith the 
. arne slluaLIon. had hIS shot 
engulfed by Triton goalIe 
Willy Morri". 

The selllor from Berkelev 
had 1 saves in a vi mage 
performance. His inspired play 
kept t he Tritons close, but. the 
speedy Bruins eventually wore 
t hei r way to a viclOry. 

"They were a much faster 
team." Harper laments. 

The Aztecs got off to an 
impressive start with just over 
four minutes gone in the fi rst 
quarter when Mike Fox 
intercepted a Tim Lyons pass 
and ret urned it s ixteen yards 
to the Hawaii 16. However, a 
clipping penalty combined 
with illegal procedure pushed 
SOS back to the Rainbow 36 
yard line, and a subsequent 
field goal attempt by Dave 
Meyer went wide right. 

The Aztecs had trouble from 
I he start in the second hal f. 
When a SDSU drive fell 'hort 
at the San Diego 45. Mike 
Jezulin pinpointed a punt 
which was downed on the 
Hawa ii three yard line. 
However, this didn 't stop the 
Rainbo\\s from taking the ball 
on a 9J yard journey for 
anot her touchdown and widen 
the margin to 21-10. On the 
series I he Bow ' again 
com'erted on three sl raight 
third down plays. Another 
lIawaii touchdown ended the 
scoring at 28· 10.

had tremendou!-> -.upport frnm

there. 

Later in the same quarter 
the Aztecs' Matt Kofler hit 
tight end John Jessop for a 67 
yard gain to the Hawaii 10 
yard line , and a pass 
interference penalt y by the 
Rainbows gave San Diego 
State a first and goal at the

Intramurals: Volleyball 
BY LAR RY GOLDMAN 

slarr Writer 
Coed Volleyball is another 

one of the intramural sports 
offered t hi s quarter, and 
according to the players, there 
is lillIe difference bet ween the 
A and AA divis ions while the 
AAA division remains only for 
the "pro '. " 

On Thur 'day night the 
Guardian game of the week 
matched two undefeated AA 
team - from the Lee League. 
Slammers with captain Carol 
Good met Petite Lapine , 
ca ptained by Ray NG _ 

Although Slammers were 
o ne gir l short they had an ai~ of 
con istency about them which 
made them look the better 
team . They took a 5- 1 lead as 
Cary Lindstrom ser ved 5 
s tra ight points. Petite ca me 
back though on some good 
serves by Mike Mc Keoun and 
led 6-5_ 

Slammers, sensi ng their 
first loss, sprung to act ion . 
Toby Delbruik , seemi ngly 
their stronges t player, had 4 
nice hits for points. All of a 
sudden Petite was down 13-7. 

After a cou ple of points by 

Petite th ' Iammers lead was 
cut to 14-11, hut Slammers had 
t he serve and looked tough. 

nfor t unatelv Tom Elliot 
from Petite " 'as not to be 
denied and after a few game 
saving 'pikes and good serving 
from NG the game ended in 
fa vor of Petite 16-14. 

That was t he first loss for 
Slammers which seemed to let 
down for the last few poi nts. 

This time Petite let down 
and showed a lack of 
communication while Slam-
mers had some sharp serves 
from Bonnie Betz and good 
play from Lindstrom. The 
game ended Quickly 15- 1 in 
favor of Slammers. 

The third game, like the 
second, was dominated by 
Bet z's 'erves and Delbruik's 
good play, and despi te some 
solid play by Petites' Beck y 
Adkins, lammers took the 
game 15-5. . . 

This left lammer' In first 
place of t he Lee League with an 
11 -1 record. Petite fell to 10-2 
but hopes to regai n its form 
against Quarters at Nine .

And what would her II care packages" be like 
without a talL cold glass of milk? 

Milk makes those /I delicious deliveries" 
taste even better. So when you open your goodies ... open the milk. 

And make sure your roommates don't eat your mail. 

theres nothing like something

This <,c<ll1s your assurance 
of a real dairy food .
