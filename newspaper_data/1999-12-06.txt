BANGKOK, Thailand - It's

offers a breathtaking view of 
some of the world's most spectac-

It is the ong-delayed Sky train, 
a 16-mile, $1.7 billion elevated 
rail system that opened for busi-
ness Sunday, snaking swiftly 
above a city that - like so many 
others in Asia - is strangling on 
its own traffic. 

Called "the train that floats in 
the air" in Thai, the privatel!' 
financed rail system is Bangkok s

the missing Mars Polar Lander on 
Sunday brought nothing but 
more interplanetary silence and 
the growing fear that the space-
craft and its $165 million mission 
are beyond recovery. 

For the first time since they 
failed to hear from the spacecraft 
after its planned landing on

the probability that all was lost. 
They said they were increasingly

MONDAY, OECEMBER 6, 1999 

On the eve of a new 
millennium, UCSD appears 

well prepared for any possible 
computer glitches 

As the new millennium draws near, the 
students and staff of UCSD have become 
increasingly confident that problems regard-
ing Y2K will be as harmless as a little bug. 

"At this point we are not aware of any seri-
ous Y2K problems at UCSD," said Assistant 
Vice Chancellor of Administrative and 
Telecommunications Elazar Harel, who is in 
charge of all Y2K-related problems. "All 
major systems were evaluated, modified 
when necessary, and tested successfully." 

Y2K is a computer-based problem that is 
caused by computers only being able to read 
the last two digits of the year when determin-
ing the date. For example, on Jan. 1, the com-
puter will interpret the date as 01/01/00 
instead of 01/01/2000. Due to certain com-
puters' two-digit-year format, Jan. 1, 2000 
could be interpreted as January 1, 1900. 

As a result of this misinterpretation of the 
year, some computers will not be able to dis-
tinguish the difference between 1800, 1900, 
and 2000. 

Other problems might arise because 2000 
is a leap year, while 1900 was not. The day of 
the week for March 1, 2000 could be interpret-
ed as Tuesday instead of the Wednesday it is 
supposed to be, and Feb. 29, 2000 might be 
lost. 

Despite the possibilities for disaster, staff 
members believe that UCSD will be safe . 

"I think outside the university there may 
be some problems, but we are very prerared 
here at school," said Muir Residentia Life

Professor 
Refuses 
C.A.P.E. 
OBJECTIONS: Brown 
says 'Off the Wall' 
section is too vulgar 
ByLAURENI.COARTNEY 
Staff Writer 

Biology professor Willie C. 
Brown says he refuses to be eval-
uated by Course and Professor 
Evaluations (C.A.P.E.), citing its 
vulgarity and raiSing questions 
about the content student-run 
publication. 

C.A.P.E. is published annually 
during winter quarter registra-
tion with a cover price of $2. It 
publishes student opinions about 
courses, professors and teaching 
assistants. Sections are organized 
by department and are interjected 
with comment forums titled "Off 
the Wall," which contain the more 
outrageous student responses 
and drawings. 

Brown said his objections can 
be summed up in four major 
points. 

Brown's first point centers 
around the objectives of C.A.P.E. 
He said the publication should 
serve three populations on cam-
pus: the students, who use 
C.A.P.E. as a mode of expression 
and as an invaluable supplement 
to class scheduling; the profes-
sors, by providing them with 
feedback that they can freely 
access any time after final grades 
are distributed; and administra-
tors, who use C.A.P.E. to gauge 
the caliber of UCSD's academic 
environment from a student's 
perspective and aids them in 
determining the quality demon-
strated by potential faculty mem-
bers. 

Brown said that C.A.P.E. is

Equal Opportunity Award Winners Announced 
DIVERSITY: Chancellor Dynes will honor 18 individuals and campus departments in annual program 
By MILODY GONZALEZ 
Seniof Staff ~er 

The 1999 Equal 
Opportunity I Affirmative Action 
arid Diversity Award recipients 
were announced on Wednesday. 
In an attempt to encourage and 
enhance the administrative and 
institutional diversity of UCSO, 
18 individuals and campus 
departments will be recogniZed 
for their efforts to promote the 
diversity of UCSD's work force 
during the past year. 

The annual awards program 
~ded over by CIlanCellor 

DS'nes and coordinated by 
Paula Does, director of human 
resources for equal opportuni-
ty / staff affirmative action. 

Awards were determined by 
one of two selection processes. 
The recipients of the Campus-
Wide Nomination Awards were 
initially nominated by members of 
the UCSD community. Students 
and stalf were ca11ed upon to nom-
inate and endorse individuals or 
groups of people which, according 
the nomination criteria, "have 
demonstrated competence in sup-
port of the university's equal 
opportunity and affirmative 
action objectives by maJdng signif-
icant contributions to UCSD." 

The award winners each made 
contributions in one or more of the 
following areas: valuing diversity, 
managing the dynamics of differ-
ence, assessing oneUs culture, 
institutionalizing diversity and lor 

adapting to diversity. Each vice 
chancellor selected one represen-
tative from his or her unit to serve 
on the nominations review panel, 
which selected the ·vinners after 
reviewing the nominations and 
endorsements submitted by mem-
bers of the UCSO community. 

Dynes will present the 1999 
Campus-Wide Nomination 
Awards to the following individ-
uals and departments: Revelle 
Dean Renee Barnett-Terry; 
Chairs of Staff Associations; 
Lupe J. Cook, administrator for 
the Joint Institute for Marine 
Observation; Diversity 
Education Training Team; 
Environment, Health and Safety 
Department; Preuss School Start 
Up Team; Chief Associate 

Professor of Pediatrics Abraham 
Rothman; Director of Physical 
Plant Services Mort Shayegan; 
Director of the Office of 
Contracts and Grants Delia H. 
Talamantez; and the UCSD 
Cancer Center Community 
Outreach Department. 

The second category of 
awardees was determined by 
UCSO's vice chancellors. Each 
vice chancellor was assigned the 
task of honoring an individual or 
group within his or her unit that 
exhibited support or contributed 
to work place diverSity. 

The recipients of this award 
category include: Graduate 
School of International Relations

C.A.P.E.: 
Editor says book 
serves students 
ContInued from ...,. 1 
contradicting its purposes by 
focusing on the negative and out-
rageous comments it receives. 

"If students are evaluating 
courses and their opinions are 
going to be read by others, then 1 
think it's important that it be as 
constructive as possible because 
they are affecting someone else's 
choices," Brown said. 

"If professors are being evalu-
ated based on these comments, if 
the comments are inaccurate or 
misplaced, how will the profes-
sor know how to improve? He 
might be evaluated by his depart-
ment with comments that are col-
ored or slanted." 

Brown also questioned the 
authenticity of the remarks. 

"One wonders how that many 
students came up with the same 
expression," he said. "Somebody, 
an editor or what have you, must 
have coached the responses. It 
raises some questions as to 
whether the comments are gen-
uine. It definitely misrepresents 
the classes." 

C.A.P.E. Director Jeremy Gray, 
who is also an employee of the 
Guardian, said that C.A.P.E. has a 
right to edit student comments. 

"C.A.P.E. has a literary 
license," Gray said. "The editors 
are free to play with the concept 
of a response. If you had 14 peo-
ple say that the class was excel-
lent, the editor has the ability to 
say that 14 people said it was bet-
ter than seeing the Beatles play 

live or something like that. As 
long as it captures the essence of 
the exact words that were used, 
they're allowed to do that." 

Brown's second point is based 
urn his concern over the source 
o C.A.P.E.'s funding, the 
Instructional Improvement 
Grant. 

C.A.P.E. receives approxi-
mately $90,000 annually from a 
government grant that is given to 
UCSD and usually allocated 
toward teaching assistant train-
ing, U.s. Gr<\nts one-unit semi-
nars and course and professor 
evaluation. 

"I have to look at C.A.P.E.'s 
objectives because I was on the 
Instructional Improvement 
Committee for several years and I 
recall that every year we 'were 
really hampered in our ability to 
provide funding for C.A.P.E.," 
Brown said. "The whole idea 
behind the committee is to 
improve the quality of instruc-
tion at UCSD." 

Gray said he disagrees. 
"C.A.P.E. is for the students," 

Gray said. "We're funded by the 
government, not the A.S. or the 
faculty. All the money is used to 
constructively evaluat~ the cours-
es and the professors by the stu-
dents for the students." 

Revelle Provost and 
Instructional Committee member 
Thomas Bond said there is a pos-
sibility that an escalation of com-
plaints could lead to the with-
drawal of C.A.P.E.'s funding. 

"Yeah, it could happen," Bond 
said. "But it's not going to come 
from the students. Yes, C.A.P.E. is 
independent from the adminis-

UC Merced Searches for Mascot 
The University of California's 10th campus is asking 

students in kindergarten through ninth.grade for ideas 
for the school's mascot. The contest. whose prize is a 
four-year scholarship to UC Merced. ends Feb. 29. 

·Over the next three months. we are hoping to hear 
from prospective students at UC Merced about the 
mascot they would most like to represent their ca~ 
pus,· said Carol Tomllnson-Keasey, chancellor of UC 
Merced. She said she expects mascot ideas that 
reflect the heritage, diversity and interests of 
California's Central ~lIey. 

The winning mascot suggestion wiN be chosen In 
May of 2000.

For her research on liver tissue engineering, 
Assistant Professor of Bioengineering Sangeeta 
Bhatia was awarded the 1999 Fellowship for Science 
and Engineering from the David and Lucile Packard 
Foundation. She will receive $625,000 over five 
years. Twenty-three other young researchers in the 
nation were awarded the fellowship this year, 

Bhatia said she is motivated by the fact that there 
are no treatments other than organ transplants for 
liver failure. She said she will use the fellowship 
money to develop additional tools that will help to 
understand liver function and to engineer replacement 
liver tissue, 

A graduate of Harvard Medical School, Bhatia has 
been part of UCSD since 1998, She is the faculty 
advisor for the Society of Women Engineers student 
group. 

The Packard Foundation was created in 1964 by 
co-founder of the Hewlett~ackard Company, David 
Packard and his wife Lucile Salter Packard. The fel-
lowship is designed to further the woll< of promising 
young scientists, promote networking among 
researchers and encourage researchers into universi-
ty careers.

The protesters at the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle lacked good reason-
ing are an embarrassing chapter in United States history 
By THEODORE DOKKO 
Staff Writer 

As the clock struck 12 a .m. Pacific 
Standard Time on the morning of Dec. 4, 
the city of Seattle, Wash. let out a collective 
sigh of relief. The World Trade 
Organization (WTO) had finished its meet-
ings earlier in the day and the dawn-to-
dusk curfew was lifted . The week-long 
nightmare had finally ended. As the dust 
finally began to settle, one hundreds had 
been arrested, stores had been looted and 
the ci ty was trashed . A week with so much 
promise for Seattlites was turned into a 
week of embarrassment and shame. 

30,000 protesters hit the streets of 
Sea ttle at the start of the conference meet-
ings on Nov. 30. Protesters gathered from 
across the nation into the Emerald City to 
argue against what they saw as negative 
effects of trade such as low wages, poor 
working conditions and environmental 
concerns. Seattle had prided itself in being 
able to host civil discussions about highly 
contentious issues. 

Many o f the groups that came, such as 

the American Federation of Labor-
Congress of Industrial Organizations 
(AFL-CIO) came to present their case in a 
lawful and orderly manner. They even 
informed police about the protests and 
marches that were going to take place and 
pledged to be peaceful in their activities. 
Unfortunately, there were other protesters 
who felt that a peaceful 

had broken out. 
In the end, the trade ministers of the 135 

member nations of the WTO were not able 
to come up with an agreement as to start-
ing a new round of global negotiations, 
When news of the breakdown reached the 
streets of Seattle, many of the protesters 
credited themselves for putting up the 

roadblocks that ultimate-
protest was not enough. 
They had to physically 
harass and taunt the for-
eign dignitaries who 
came from across the 
world to the event. As 
police tried to guarantee 
access to the convention 
center for the different 
trade ministers and their 

con 
I¥ stalled the WTD's 
meeting.

entourages, the protest-
ers became more and more violent. 
Militant factions startE!<i to destroy the city, 
vandalizing the shops, painting graffiti on 
the walls with obscenities and lighting up 
dumpsters throughout the city. Inciting 
more and more fervor within the mob, 
some mob members began looting. A riot 

shaking in their boots." 
Protesters started giving 

each other high-fives and dancing in the 
streets to celebrate their "accomplish-
ments." 

Though many of the protesters feel that 
they were the reason for the breakdown in 
negotiations, they are unfortunately 
deceiving themselves. The havoc and 

chaos caused In the streets of Seattle did lit-
tle to prevent negotiators and delegates 
from coming to the conference. After final-
ly being let into the meetings, the delegates 
immediately sought to hammer out an 
agreement. After staying up several nights 
in a row trying to find a resolution, they 
simply agreed to disagree for the time 
being. To get 135 very different sovereign 
powers to agree on anything is a monu-
mental task. 

Protesters argued for four days that to 
statt another round of world negotiations 
would simply lead to a denigration of the 
environment and an increase in the 
explOitation of workers around the world . 
Although their arguments do have some 
validity, they must be dismissed on the 
grounds of relevancy. It is true that envi-
ronments and local ecosystems are being 
damaged. However, basic economics will 
say that environmental concerns must be 
considered as a luxury. When faced with a 
choice between mere survival or the pro-
tection of the environment, the answer is

PROTEST: 
Seattle Police mis-
handled the protest 
ContInued ........... 4 
groups and the majority of the 
protesters were substantially 
civilized and pacific. 
Nonetheless, we should renew 
our commitment to limit these 
outbreaks of violence. 

The presence of small pock-
ets of violence is unfortunately 
common in large demonstra-
tions, and it is a delicate task for 
the police to isolate violent indi-
viduals without interfering 
other protesters' civil right to 
voice dissent. From this point of 
view, the Seattle police failed 
miserably. 

At first the police largely 
underestimated the size of the 
demonstration, sending little 
more than 1,000 officers to con-
tain and direct the crowd. 
When violence started, the 
police were u~able to control 
the situation and resorted to a 
hysterical reaction that has 
been >criticized by police 
departments around the coun-
try. The use of tear gas and rub- . 
ber bullets is an extreme mea-
sure that is absolutely unjusti-
fied under the circumstances. 
The curfew and the presence of 
National Guard troops gave the 
intervention an aura of "nor-
malization" not worthy of a 
democratic country. 

Such a lack of preparation is 
inexcusable, given that the 
demonstration were certainly 
not a spontaneous occurrence. 
Groups opposing WTO policies 
have been preparing for several 
months and it is difficult to 
imagine how the police could 
have been unaware of the 
potential uprising. In its 
defense, Seattle is not a fity 

used to such demonstrations. 
Had the meeting been held in 
Washington, D.C. or New York, 
it is likely that the police would 
have been better prepared and 
the worst incidents of violence 
and repression would have been 
avoided. 

More than anything else, this 
demonstration has shown a 
change in people's attitudes 
toward economic policy. In 1%8 
protesters marched in 
Washington demanding politi-
cal changes. In 1999 protesters 
seem very skeptical about poli-
tics, but they still march in large 
numbers at a meeting of an 
international economic func-
tion. This shilt is indicative of 
the tremendous transfer of 
power from politics to economy 
that has taken place over the last 
30 years. Today, significant deci-
sions about our lives are made 
in Atlanta, Tokyo, London and 
in every city where large organi-
zations with international inter-
ests meet. 

Unfortunately, our govern-
ment has not followed the 
same evolutionary path. While 
we have a constitution and 
laws to protect us from abuses 
of political power, we don't 
have any similar mechanism to 
protect us from abuses of eco-
nomic power. The creation of 
such mechanisms will be a 
long and painful process, just 
as political revolutions are, 
because it will go against the 
interests of a powerful minori-
ty. In addition, our cultural 
bias is that economic freedom 
is necessary to protect us from 
political oppression. But times 
have changed, and it might be 
time to start using our political 
freedom to protect us from eco-
nomic oppression. It is com-
forting to know that the pro-
testers in Seattle understood 
this.

Treaty Needs U.S. Support 
COMMENTARY: Nations vow to protect children 
By DIVYA RUNCHAL 
Staff Writer 

Last November marked the 
10th anniversary of the 
"Convention on the Rights of the 
Child" treaty which has the goals 
to improve education, health care 
and provide better living condi-
tions for children. There was little 
reason for anyone to celebrate. 
Although the treaty has been for-
mally ratified by 191 countries 
and adopted unanimously by the 
United Nations, two nations still 
stand in its way: Somalia and the 
United States. 

These countries' opposition to 
the treaty have resulted in a 
stand-still in the movement for 
the human rights of children who 
suffer daily from the effects of 
war, inadequate protection from 
disease and lack of food. More 
than 50 nations have chosen to 
amend their constitutions so that 
these abuses of the past will not 
be as likely to occur in the future. 

One such nation is the 
Philippines, which has enacted 
laws that protect children from 
sexual predators. Others, includ-
ing Afghanistan, Sierra Leone 
and the Sudan have implemented 
"days of tranquillity" upon 
which opposit.io!, groups . cease 
fire so that mllbons of children 
can be immunized from di~f~ase. 

Although the United States 
signed the treaty in 1995, conser-
vative leader Senator Jesse 
Helms (R-N.C.) opposed the 
treaty, saying that it is an "insane 
interpretation of international 
law.' However, Denesha Reid, 
director of public policy at 
Concerned Women for America 
in Washington, argues that it 

"gives children unlimited rights, 
such as freedom of expression. 
It's also against abuse of children 
and, while we' re opposed to 
abuse, what is abuse? Does that 
include spanking a child?A .fam-
ily should be able to diSCipline a 
child as it sees fit." 

This assertion is preposterous, 
given that the treaty's actual 
wording states that "no child 
shall be subjected to torture or 
other cruel, inhumane or degrad-
ing treatment or punishment." 

Many would argue that 
spanking a child once or twice is 
not indicative of torturous pun-
ishment. It is a sad day when the 
United States turns a blind eye to 
the plight of poor and impover-
ished children in other nations, 
because the United States has so 
much political clout. Politicians 
like President Clinton, who is 
fearful of the conser\lative back-
lash that may result if he submits 
the treaty to the Senate, have cho-
sen not to listen to his conscience, 
but rather to their public policy 
advisors. 

When 191 nations many of 
which have never agreed on other 
issues agree to "ign a treaty aimed 
at protecting the rights of innocent 
children who live in war-torn 
areas and suffer decrepit living 
conditions, this is a clear sign that 
there is a cause worthy of bringing 
political enemies together. 

The time has come for the 
United States to support the glob-
al child rights treaty and help 
save millions of disadvantaged 
children around the world from 
illiteracy, disease and death. It is 
time for someone in this nation to 
stand up and tell our leaders that 
we must ratify this treaty.

COMMENTARY: New Year's Day is logically nothing special 

Sbadracb Theory 

C SHANNON !A.STIE 
[f [ hear the word "millenni-

um" one more time, I'm going to 
scream. I promise. And, [ don ' t 
mean "scream" in that hyper, 
happy, junior high kind of way. 
I'm going to be very, very 
annoyed. 

J honestly don' t understand 
the importance that the world, 
most notably America (as usual) 
has placed on the celebration of 
the new millennium or even the 
new year for that matter. 
Leaving the Y2K issue entirely 
out of the question, I'd like to 
ask one thing: How is life on Jan. 
1, 2000 going to be any different 
from life on Dec. 31 , 1999? Is it 
going to be better? What exactly 
will we be celebrating? 

Most other national celebra-
tions have a point, even if those 
purposes have been totally lost. 
Christmas and Easter both 
sprang from a mix of Christian 
and pagan religious celebra-
tions. The Jewish and Muslim 
annual holidays, while they 
haven' t been entirely captured 
by secular America, also have 
religious significance. 
Thanksgiving is for, well .. . giv-
ing thanks, and President's Day 
in February gives us some time 
off from work or school. 

New Year 's Day, on the other 
hand, celebrates the passage of 
another year. [ don' t know why 
we don' t do this all the time. It's 

been a whole year since Dec. 6, 
1998. Why not celebrate now? 

The fact is that we plan our 
celebration around a calendar 
that was fairly arbitrarily 
designed . We' re all smart peo-
ple, so we all know what B.C 
and A.D. stand for, right? [' 11 
spell it out for all of you non-
Revellians: Before Christ, and 
Anno Domini, the "Year of our 
Lord ." That's right, folks, 
according to the calendar, the 
celebration of the new millenni-

The stroke of midnight 
does not magically erase 
all the problems of the 
past year, nor does it 
make you less inclined to 
create problems for the 
next year. 

urn is actually just a big birthday 
party for Jesus Christ. He'll be 
turning 2,000. 

You can look at this from two 
perspectives. If you're a 
Christian, celebrating Jesus' 
2,OOOth probably isn't a big deal. 
[n theory, you should be cele-
brating Jesus' birth all the time, 
not just one day a year. For the 
rest of you, the birthday bash 
should have absolutely no sig-
nificance. Why base your cele-
bration schedule around the 
birth of a random stranger that 
died quite a while ago? 

Even for those who think 
New Year 's Eve celebrations are 
simply a randomly assigned 
opportunity to reflect on the old 

year and to make a "fresh start," 
the holiday is a self-deception. 
The stroke of midnight does not 
magically erase all the problems 
of the past year, nor does it make 
you less inclined to create prob-
lems for the next year. Last year, 
[ had a great time at a party on 
New Year 's Eve, but woke up 
the next morning to find that the 
celebration hadn't eliminated 
my ex;boyfriend, hadn't paid 
my Christmas bills and hadn't 
even inspired me to do anything 
about my grades. It's a great 
excuse for a party, as long as you 
forget that you're not really cele-
brating anything. 

The "millennium" new year 
is being given even more atten-
tion than past new year celebra-
tions due to all kinds of spiritual 
significance that people have 
chosen to place on the number 
2,000. [have one question for 
them: If some deity is going to 
put an end to the wo'rld, do you 
really think it's going to be 
according to some stupid calen-
dar that we made up? No 
offense, people, but [ really think 
that God has his own plans and 
is not going to be convinced to 
do everything on our schedule. 
So give up the doomsday 
approach "Iready. You're going 
to look pretty stupid on Jan. 1 
when we're all still around, earth 
included. 

That said, I'll leave you all to 
the pOintless planning of your 
New Year's Eve bashes. I'm off to 
make the final preparations for 
my Dec. 7 party. It's going to be a 
blast. After all, it's been a whole

very simple - survival. In addi-
tion, the effects of globalization 
through the efforts of the WTO 
are beneficial to the environ-
ment. 
. There are cases in which the 

people of areas such as Southeast 
Asia and Central America, which 
have nothing to do with the 
WTO, commit the worst environ-
ment pillaging of natural 
resources. With organizations 
such as the WTO, national 
actions are put under the inter-
national investigation, and the 
treatment of the environment is 
one of those details that is care-
fully examined. 

Some protesters will say that 
workers of the world are being 
exploited by multinational cor-
porations. The workers are 
laboring in horrible conditions 
while being paid very low 
wages. No one disputes these 
facts . However, the solution to 
this problem once again is glob-
alization. 

The basis of capitalism, found 
in Adam Smith's The Wealth of 
Nations, is specialization. When 
a nation can produce a certain 
good with more efficiency and 
with lower costs than another, it 
is obvious that nations should 
specialize and trade with each 
other. The end result is beneficial 
to both nations and to the rest of 
the society. 

Many will point to the over-
worked, badly treated and 
underpaid worker in a third 
world nation as a victim of glob-
alization. However, that worker 
would be even poorer without 

The ·strength of local groups 
demanding better treatment is at 
an all-time high and still grow-
ing. The United States is an 
excellent example of a nation 
that has sought to treat its work-
ers better once everyone was 
able to put food on ttie table and 
clothes on their backs. 

Globalization is a good thing 
for the citizens of the United 
States and also for the people of 
the rest of the world. Of the four 
major candidates for president 
of the United States, Gov. 
George W. Bush, Senator John 
McCain, Vice President AI Gore 
and Senator Bill Bradley, all 
agree on this premise. To see 
such agreement across such a 
wide political spectrum speaks 
volumes to the benefits of glob-
alization and organizations such 
as the WTO. 

As the WTO conference has 
ended, we as a nation cem close 
one embarrassing and shameful 
chapter in our history. Sadly, 
unruly and irresponSible pro-
testers brought a degree of con-
tempt to the city of Seattle in the 
eyes of international observers: 

Those who were civil in their 
protests should be commended 
for their dignity. Although they 
failed to see benefits of global-
ization that lead to improvement 
of living conditions across the 
world, protection of the environ-
ment and economic prosperity 
that has never been seen before, 
they brought up their own 
issues of concern to the public 
eye.

Brown draws upon UCSD's 
principles of community to 
emphasize his third objection. He 
states that the university pro-
motes expression within the 
bonds of "courtesy, sensitivity, 
confidentiality and respect" in an 
atmosphere free of "abusive or 
demeaning treatment." 

Brown said that some of

"There seems to be a fixation 
on sexually oriented expression," 
Brown said. "Either graphic or 
written, it's inappropriate to

totally irrelevant to anything. My 
question is: How does it improve

U Although we don't expect any 
major probfems, we would not be 
surprised if minor Y2K-related 
problems will surface," he said. 

Harel said his confidence 
regarding Y2K and UCSD stems 
from the Y2K Advisory commit-
tee that was formed last year. 

"Although UCSD has not 
encountered much in the way of 
problems, if no action would have 
been taken, some problems would 
have definitely occurred," he said. 

The advisory committee, com-
posed of 15 members from 13 dif-
ferent groups that Harel works 
with as vice chancellor, has 
already set up a school Y2K Web 
site and planned several Y2K 
alert messages, as well as tested 
all systems looking for computer 
incompatibility. 

Harel said that all student sys-
tems, financial systems, payroll 
systems and utility systems have 
been checked and will now run 
properly into next year. 

At the UCSD Medical Center 
proper precautions have been 
taken as well to ensure an easy 
transition into the new year.

equipment [at the hospital)," clin-

Gray expressed surpri~ at ~he 
recent criticism their pubhcatton 
has received. 

Hyou can look at any issue of 
CA.P.E.; [the 'Off the Wall' sec-
tion) has always been there,'" 
Gray said. ''I'm curious as to why 
this has become an issue so sud-
denly. Each 'Off the Wall' com-
ment is voted in by the staff; we 
go with anything that is outra-
geous or makes us laugh . We 
have an equal number of guys 
and girls working on the staff so 
there is no sex discrimination. We 
don't do it to sell CA.P.E., it's just 
been a tradition since about 
1982." 

Gray said that the current 
issue is less vulgar than its prede-
cessors. 

"Normally, we don' t include 
the really obscene stuff, but last 
year's director just threw some in 
at the last minute before he lett," 
Gray Said. 

Bond said he disagrees with 
some of CA.P.E:s content and 
compared some of it to the Koala. 

"What I do object tei is what I 
call 'Koala-level pornography,'" 
said Bond, who said he thinks 
CA.P.E. is great except for its 
questionable material. "I don't 
object to it in the Koala. [ don' t 
have to read the Koala any more 
than [ have to read Hustler, but I 
do have to read CAP.E. I'm a big 
believer in the First Amendment, 

ical engineering Senior Electronic 
Technician Rick Rambo said . 
"Some equipment has the ability 
to roll over to 2000 but it needs to 
be reset after the new year." 

Rambo said that bio-techni-
cians will be at the hospital on 
Jan. 1 to reset the date and time 
functions on any equipment that 
needs to be rolled over. 

With all the precautions taken 
to ensure safety at the hospital, 
Rambo is confident that the lives 
of the patients staying there on 
Jan. 1 will not be i{'l danger. 

"We don't expect any patients 
to have any extra problems due to 
Y2K," he said. "All the problems 
have been remedied ." 

The lack of urgency at the uni-
verSity and at the hospital has 
caused many to believe that prob-
lems surrounding Y2K on cam-
pus will be less serious than some 
have anticipated . 

"[ think if anything it will be a 
slow fizzle rather than a big 
explOSion," said graduate student 
Andrew Patton. "But we should 
watch Sydney because they will 
be getting it first." 

However, according to 
Rambo, this heightened concern 
over matters regarding Y2K has 
had some positive effects here on 
campus. The increase in anxiety 
has led to the school taking more 
precautions to ensure its safety. 

"The hype surrounding. Y2K 
made an awareness that some-
thing had to be done," Rambo 
said'. "Because of that, there will 
be no impact at all or [it will be) 
very minor." 

As an indication of this 
increased awareness, the univer-
sity has been preparing for Y2K 
since the beginning of 1996, run-

rented the box, and no one at

Comments such as "Exams 
were as easy as Snow White at a 
Dwarf convention" form the 
basis of Brown's fourth and final 
objection. He calls these "insensi-
tive remarks." 

"Biology is the largest depar!-
ment on campus and has an envI-
able reputation for its teaching 
and contributions to biomedical 
science," Brown said, holding up 
a cartoon featuring orally ingest-
ed sperm. " [s this the best 
CA.P.E. can do to introduce this 
distinguished department?" 

Gray said that CAP.E is not 
obligated to portray UCSD in a 
favorable light. 

"We are a service to the stu-
dents, not the biology depart-
ment," Gray said. "We're a stu-
dent-run organization. What 
would happen if someone else was 
running it, like the A.5.? You might 
not be getting the most fair or hon-
est results. Students feel safe in 
giving theIr opinions [to us) ." . 

According to Gray, CAP.E. IS 
run by a different director every 
year and is often at the mercy of 
the current director's prefer-
ences. Gray said he would like to 
tone CA.P.E. down this year but 
stresses the need for the publica-
tion to retain the interest of the 
students at the same time. 

"A part of me would like to 
just put out the most straight- for-
ward issue ever, but that's not our 
book anymore, it's the faculty's 
book," Gray said. "However, we 
are willing to listen to depart-

companies that supply the school 
with electricity and water. 

According to Harel, each of 
these companies has successfully 
tested their systems and no prob-
lems have occurred. 

"At trus point we believe that 
the campus is ready for Y2K," 
Harel said. "We are finalizing 
plans fo~ the actual New Year 
weekend in terms of staff pres-
ence on campus, emergency rre-
pared ness, et cetera. We wil be 
performing a lot of tests on Dec. 
31 and throughout that weekend 
to ensure everything is operating 
well ." 

[n addition, the police depart-
ment will have 12 officers on duty 
at all times on Dec. 31 in case of 
any emergency. 

Regardless, Assistant Police 
Chief Jay Dire said he is not wor-
ried about possible problems. 

"From the law enforcement 
standpoint, there shouldn't be 
any problems at aU,"Dire said. 
"New-Year 's Eve is not typically 
popular on campus." 

Most students that live on 
campus will not be at school on 
Dec. 31 as all the residence halls 
will be locked on Dec. 19 and 
won't open again until Jan. 9. 

Along with this policy, the 
school decided several years ago 
that th~ winter quarter in the year 
2000 would start a week later to 
make sure any Y2K-related prob-
lems could be resolved . 

"This is the latest we have ever 
started school since I have been 
here," Danylyshyn-Adams said . 
"But we wanted to pad the trav-
eling time for students during the 
breaK just in case problems do 
occur." 

precipitously, the Nude

discussion, prompting adminis-
trators to review their enforce-
ment strategies.

Board of Trustees endorsed the

old tradition die.

Iraq Threatens France Over U.N. Vote SKYTRAIN: 
Thailand has few 
road rage problems 

from the economy in lost work 
hours. 

Residents of Bangkok have the 
region's longest average round trip 
to work, it found, at 82 minutes. A few days before the U.N. Security Council is expected to 

vote on a new arms inspection 
system for Iraq, the Iraqi govern-
ment threatened France on 
Sunday with retaliation against 
its diplomats and oil companies 
if it supports the proposal. 

The government of Saddam 
Hussein apparently senses that 
it can no longer rely on France :-
and perhaps not on Russia either

inspections after a year of indeci-
sion by the Security Council and

and with comment:! from offi-

Iraq is in effect asking the French

to choose between potential 
business deals, the repayment of 
Iraqi debts, and good relations

School Districts Seek to 
Punish Parents for Truancy 

DETROIT - Across the 
United States, public school dis-
tricts like Detroit's are teaming 
with prosecutors to fight truancy, 
threatening jail time and fines for 
parents of children who chroni-
cally skip school. The moves are 
the latest step in the nation's 
march to hold students to higher 
educational standards and to 
hold their parents to higher stan-
dards of accountability. 

In Detroit, 63,000 of the 180,000 
public school students missed 
more than a month's worth of 
classes last school year. The . par-
ents of 67 of the worst offenders 
have been summoned to a meet-
ing this week and told they face 
jail time if they cannot get their 
children to attend school. 

Around the country, schools 
that have tried less severe meth-
ods to get students to class are 
losing patience with chronic tru-
ants and threatening to punish 
their parents. 

Across the country, school sys-
tems have reported some initial 
successes with the policies, and 

MARS: 
Hopes of finding

ods to make radio contact may 
have been their best hope. They 
were fast running out of testable 
ideas on how to determine and 
possibly correct what went 
wrong. 

At a news conference, Richard 
Cook, the project manager, said 
that a sense of time running out 
was making the control team 
"more frustrated and more 
tense." Another listening oppor-
tunity during the night and two 
more early Tuesd;:y cffered what 
officials considered the last realis-
tic hopes of hearing something 
from the lander, if it is not totally 
disabled. 

"These are the big cards we 
'still have to play," Cook said. 
"Beyond that, I think that, 
frankly, the likelihood of success 
is quite small." 

many teachers and school admin-
istrators applaud the moves, but 
parents and students are split 
over punishing truants' parents. 

The American Civil liberties 
Union is troubled by the notion of 
holding parents responsible for 
the actions of their children, and 
questions whether such policies 
will help. 

Some school districts have tried 
revoking the driver's licenses of 
students who skip school, having 
police round up children found at 
shopping malls during school 
hours, and threatening to require 
students to go to summer school. 

"They've tried everything from 
soup to nuts to try to address this 
problem," said Bill Modzeleski, 
director of the Safe and Drug-Free 
Schools Program of the U.S. 
Department of Education. 

&>me districts are punishing 
parents because "they have seen 
these programs that they have 
instituted have not worked," he 
said.

Scientists on the project could 
only wait helplessly as their 
prospects for discoveries about 
the climate history of Mars and 
possible conditions favoring life 
there seemed to fade away. 

The prognosis for the two 
small probes that were supposed 
to penetrate the ground near the 
~anding site seemed to be even 
more discouraging. Every two 
hours since late Friday, engineers 
listened anxiously for signals 
from them, without success. 
Tracking data just before the 
landing descent indicated that 
the probes may have landed on 
the inside edges of a crater, which 
might block signals from their 
transmitters. 

"The next 24 hours with the 
probes is really telling," said 
Sarah Gavit, who headed the 
team that developed the two 
water-searchmg penetrators. "We 
will have exhausted most of our 
options after thaI."

would create a new arms-inspec-
tion system for Iraq to replace 
the U.N. Special Commission, 
which was' formed after the 
defeat of Iraq in the 1991 Persian 
Gulf war to monitor a require-
ment that Iraq rid itself of 
weapons of mass destruction. 

Inspectors were evacuated 
from Iraq before British and 
American bombing raids a year 
ago, and Iraq barred their return 
after the air strikes. 

'The current version of the res-
olution reflects the American 
view that there has to be Iraqi 
compliance with the weapon 
inspectors and that intrusive 
inspections on the ground must 
be permitted. But significant dif-
ferences remain over how to 
evaluate Iraqi compliance and in 
what time frame. 

Iraq has repeatedly said that 
it will never let any inspectors 
back in unless sanctions are 
lifted first. Some council mem-
bers say, however, that this 
may be Iraq's opening position 
for the hard bargaining that 
will follow if the resolution 
passes.

WIG Foes Aim for Momentum 
The surprisingly large 

protests in Seattle by critics of the 
World Trade Organization point 
to the emergence of a new and 
vocal coalition that will make it 
far harder for the Clinton admin-
istration to move ahead with its 
plans for freer trade. 

In addition, many Seattle pro-
testers hope their movement will 
last lo~ger than the Vietnam War 
movement because their target 
- globalization - is not a single 
issue that can be resolved by a 
peace treaty. 

"We're really in it for the long 
haul on the trade issue," said 
John Sweeney, president of the 
AFL-CIo. "We've been working 
on building this coalition for a 
few years now, and we'll now 
put our heads together to see 
how we build on this." 

Most of the more than 30,000 
Seattle demonstrators were 
union members, environmental-
ists and college students, who 
wanted not to end globalization 
but to soften its harshest effects. 
Almost all were peaceful, and 
their large protest march and sit-

ins were in sharp contrast to the 
100 to 200 self-styled anarchists 
who turned Seattle into a battle 
zone by smashing windows and 
clashing with the police. 

Supporters of free trade fear 
that this new coalition against 
the trade group will be more 
effective in fighting free-trade 

It could prove much 
harder for Congress to 
ignore this new coalition 
because it contains a 
wide swath of Main 
Street America 
efforts than the nation's one, 
long-standing foe of freer trade: 
the labor movement. 

In the past, it was easy for 
lawmakers to discount labor's 
opposition to liberalizing trade 
because unions were often derid-
ed as self-serving protectioniSts. 
Labor largely led the fight against 
the North American Free Trade 
Agreement - and lost. Since 
then, however, labor has learned 

the importance of forming coali-
tions and has reached out more to 
other groups. 

It could prove much harder 
for Congress to ignore this new 
coalition because it contains a 
wide swath of Main Street 
America: not just steelworkers 
and auto workers, but anti-
sweatshop protesters from cam-
puses across the nation and 
members of church groups, the 
Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth 
and the Humane Society. 

"I think this Seattfe move-
ment has legs," said Todd Gitlin, 
a New York l:iniversity professor 
who has written extenSively on 
protest movements. "The issues 
that brought these people to 
Seattle are enduring issues. They 
are not the subject of a single 
egregious policy, like Vietnam. 
It's not just about the WTO -
it's about the dominance of huge 
corporate power over globaliza-
tion. This green ie-Sweeney 
alliance has a future."

Case Against Gun Makers Takes New 
Approach After Illinois Decision 

A decision by an Illinois state 
judge last week to continue a pri-
vate lawsuit that accused the gun 
industry of knowingly creating 
an underground market in hand-
guns has encouraged the 28 cities 
and counties that are suing the 
firearms companies and may 
suggest that judges have become 
more receptive to innovative 
claims against gun makers. 

The decision, by Judge Jennifer 
Duncan-Brice of Cook County 
Circuit Court in Chicago, was in a 
case brought by the families of 
three people killed by handguns 
and not in a better-known lawsuit 
by the city of Chicago. 

But lawyers involved in the 
municipal lawsuits said the 
claims made by the families -
that the firearms industry negli-
gently distributed its products 
and created a public nuisance -
are similar to cases brought by 

Chicago and other cities and 
offer some indication of how 
judges may regard this new 
approach to attempting to hold 
the gun companies responsible 
for urban violence. 

Judge Duncan-Brice denied a 
motion by the gun ~ompanies to 
dismiss the lawsuit, saying that 
individuals, not just a govern-
mental entity, could bring a 
claim that the firearms industry 
as a whole had created a public 
nuisance. 

The /'udge also said it was 
"very c ear to this court" that 
gun companies knowingly vio-
lated Chicago'S strict anti-hand-
gun laws by oversupplying gun 
shops in the suburbs, where the 
laws are weaker, "creating an 
underground market" in 
Chicago. 

The decision is not a binding 
precedent in Illinois or other 

states, but it is one of several 
recent rulings that may increase 
the pressure on the firearms 
industry to nesotiate a settle-
ment after years in which the 
gun companies won almost all 
suits against them, arguing that 
they could not be held liable for 
damages caused by a legally 
manufactured product. 

Officials from several of the 
gun companies and lawyers 
from San Francisco and Los 
Angeles, among other cities, 
are scheduled to meet in 
Washington on Tuesday as part 
of a newly formed committee 
to discuss what changes manu-
facturers could make in the 
design and safety of their hand-
guns as a way to end the law-
suits.

ALTHOUGH RARELY 
MENTIONED. IN PUBLIC 

FOR.UMS, SUICIDE IS 
THE THIR.D LEADING 

CAUSE OF DEATH FOR. 
YOUNG ADULTS AGES 

19 TO 24, RANKING 
SECOND AMONG 

COLLEGE STUDENTS. 

The UCSD Guardian 

S
uicide is a quiet but deadly epidem-
ic in our country, striking people of 
all ages and backgrounds. Accord-
ing to new studies recently pub-
lished, suicide is now a serious issue 
of public health which in past years 
has been stigmatized into silence. 

This year the Surgeon General, 
David Satcher, issued a Call to Action for the Pre-
vention of Suicide. According to the Call to Action, 
" ... more teenagers and young adults die from sui-
cide than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth 
defects, stroke, pneumonia and influenza and 
chronic lung disease combined." 

In her new book, Night Falls Fast, Kay Redfield 
Jamison, professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hop-
kins University School of Medicine and co-author 
of the standard medical text on manic-depressive 
illness, turns her focus to suicide. She centers her 
work around suicide in those under 40 while rec-
ognizing the need for attention to the incidence of 
suicide in the elderly. Redfield presents some star-
tling statistics: There is one suicide every 17 min-
utes in the United States, and it is the third leading 
cause of death in those between the ages of 19 and 
24. 

Statistics 
The Suicide Prevention Advocacy Network 

places suicide as' the eighth leading cause of death 

FEATURES II 

overall in the United States. The National Institute 
of Mental Health (NIMH) places suicide as the 
third leading cause of death for those aged 15 to 24, 
behind accidental injury and homicide. The Sur-
geon General's Call to Action to Prevent Suicide 
states, "Between 1952 and 1996, the reported rates 
of suicide among adolescents and young adults 
nearly tripled." 

The statistics combine to paint a distressing pic-
ture for college campuses. According to the Ameri-
can Foundation for Suicide Prevention, "Suicide is 
the second leading cause of death among college 
students." Unintentional injuries rank first, and 
homicide ranks third. 

Jamison quotes the Center for Disease Control 
and Prevention's 1995 National College Health 
Risk Behavior Survey, which found that "one in 10 
college students had seriously considered suicide 
during the year prior to the survey; most had gone 
so far as to draw up a plan." Numbers like these 
illustrate the need for greater attention to the 
often-silent epidemic, particularly at the college 
level. 

Just as the age brackets are clear, the gender 
lines are clearly drawn, as well. Men die from sui-
cide far more often than women do. According to 
NIMH, the gender ratio for ages 15 to 19 is 5:1 
(males to females). The next bracket, which encom-

7:1. Covering all age groups, 73 
percent of all suicides are com-
mitted by white men, however 
twice as many women than men 
report a history of suicide 
attempts. 

Suicide and Depreuion 
Although it seems an easy leap 

to associate suicide with depres-
sion, it is important to recognize 
that a suicidal individual is suf-
fering from more than a simple 
case of the blues. 

Examining the connection 
between depression and suicide, 
Jamison states that "when people 
are suicidal, their thinking is par-
alyzed, their options appear spare 
or nonexistent, their mood is 
despairing and hopelessness per-
meates their entire mental 
domain. The future cannot be 
separated from the present, and 
the present is painful beyond 
solace." 

NIMH lists depression, alco-
hol or other drug use disorders 
and aggressive or disruptive 
behaviors as the strongest risk 
factors for attempted suicide in 
youth. Other risk factors include 
prior suicide attempts, a firearm 
in the home, especially in house-
holds where young people live, 
and exposure to the suicidal 
behavior of others. 

The Surgeon General's Call to 
Action states that those at risk 
include "youth, the medically ill, 
persons with mental and sub-

stance abuse disorders and the 
elderly." 

The document further catego-
rizes the following as contribut-
ing to risk: mental disorders, par-
ticularly mo"d disorders; co-
occurring mental and alcohol and 
substance abuse disorders; barri-
ers to accessing mental health 
treatment; easy access to lethal 
methods, especially guns; local 
epidemics of suicide that have a 
contagious influence; isolation, or 
a feeling of being cut off from 
other people. 

There are many recorded 
instances of imitative suicide and

cide. 
Jamison writes that disorders 

such as depression, manic 
depression and schizophrenia are 
often related to suicides. A Health 
Gllide published by America 's 
Pharmaceutical Research Compa-
nies claims that roughly 40 mil-
lion Americans face mental ill-
nesses including panic disorder, 
depression, manic depression 
and schizophrenia each year. The 
publication references NIMH 
with its claim that "90 percent of 
people with mental illnesses will 
improve or recover if they get 
appropriate treatment such as 

"One in 10 college students had seriously considered 
suicide during the year prior to the survey; most had 
gone so far as to draw up a plan."

Health Risk BehavIor Suney 

suicide outbreaks. However, the 
occurrence of a suicide at a high 
school or college does not neces-
sarily cause a cluster of suicides. 

"Imitation plays an important 
role, of course," Jamison states. 
"But presumably a suicide disin-
hibits or triggers suicidal behav-
ior only in an already vulnerable 
individual." 

These clusters do not favor a 
certain locale. They occur in psy-
chiatric hospitals and high 
schools, suburban America and 
college campuses. Clusters hap-
pen in every state and every 
country that records such death 
patterns. The American Founda-
tion for Suicide Prevention states 
that stress events ranging from a 
diSCiplinary crisis to recent rejec-
tion often precipitate youth sui-

counseling, medication or a com-
bination of both." 

The American Foundation for 
Suicide Prevention found that 
"psychiatric diagnoses are pre-
sent in about 90 percent of sui-
cides." 

Furthermore, alcohol and 
• cocaine abuse was found in about 

two-thirds of 18 to 19-year-old 
males committing suicide, 
though it is uncommon in 
younger male or female suicides. 
In contrast, it also found that 
"only a small number of suicides 
occur in schiwphrenic or manic-
depressive teenagers." 

NIMH puts suicide by 
firearms as the "most common ' 
method for both men and 
women, accounting for 59 percent 
of all suicides." The American 

Food for thought 

Foundation for Suicide Preven-
tion seconds this: "Firearms are 
the most common method in the 
United States [fo r committing sui-
cide)." Ingestions, or attempts 
that a re made by taking toxic 
amounts of pills, is more common 
in women than in men. Suicide by 
hanging is more prevalent in 
early adolescence than in older 
age groups. 

The Foundation also . grids 
method by location. While hang-
ing is frequent in all locations, 
firearms are prevalent in rural 
areas. Jumping tends to happen in 
urban areas. The suburbs have a 
gteater incidence of asphyxiation. 

Prevention 
NIMH states' that "recognition 

and appropriate treatment of men-
tal and substance abuse disorders 
for particularly high risk age, gen-
der and cultural groups is the 
most promising way to prevent 
suicide and suicidal behavior." 

If you feel that a friend or fam-
ily member may be suicidal, Jami-
son offers the following advice: 
Take him or her seriously. Involve 
other people including a thera-
pist, crisis intervention team or 
even a 911 operator. Listen. 
Express concern; "stress that sui-
cide is a permanent solution to 
temporary problems," states 
Jamison.

The best study food during finals week 
By BETH ARNESE 
Food Critic 

favorite is the Grilled Artichoke 
Heart Sandwich ($4.95), which is 
marinated artichoke hearts with 
tomatoes and provolone cheese 
on fresh focaccia bread . This 
sandwich is simple: if you like 
grilled artichokes, you will like it. 
If you don' t like artichoke hearts, 
you won't like it. 

How do you feel about WWF 
wrestling? . Each time the fire alarm at Geisel rings during finals, it is my 

secret wish that the library is 
actually on fire. 

Of course, it is always a prank, 
and the post-fire alarm scene out-
side Geisel turns into one of the 
most social 
events of the 
quarter. I 
always end up 
running into 
people I haven't 
seen since I was 
a freshman din-
ing at Plaza 
Cafe. 

I remember 
last year after a 
fire alarm when it was particularly 
crowded in the library lounge and 
my friends were desperate to fin-
ish studying their econometrics. 
Their solution: set up a make-shift 
table, made from cardboard boxes, 
in the closet next to the library 
lounge and study aw~y! To them, I 
dedicate a complete guide to 
studying and eating off campu$ 
when the alarm at Geisel goes off... 

The first obvious destination is 
Pacific Beach. Cafe Crema, locat-
ed on the comer of Gamet and 
Cass, has a great atmosphere and 
is always packed. I always begin 
my study session with a large 
Cafe Crema Mocha ($3.85). This 
mocha is just the right size to get 
me fired up for even the most dis-
mal subjects. Although most pe0-
ple say they can't tell the differ-
ence between nonfat and whole 
milk used in mochas, I think that 
a nonfat mocha is no comparison 
to a full·fat mocha. Make the 
switch to whole milk and you 
won't go back. 

Cafe Crema is different than 
your run-of-the-miU coffee shop 
because people are always order-
ing real food here! My personal 

If your sense of date and time 
is distorted by 
studying so 
much, Greek 
Eggs ($4.25) 
are perfect 
when you 
crave breakfast 
foods, and 
they are served 
any time of 
day. This dish 
of two large 

eggs steamed with spinach, feta 
cneese, and olives, and served 
with a bagel is an excellent bar-
gain for all the food . 

Crema also offers a wide vari-
ety of delicious baked treats, 
ranging fro m fudge brownie 
cheesecake to cappuccino or 
chocolate chip muffins. 

UCSD Study Efficiency Rating: 
The music is so good and so loud, 
that you may find it difficult to -
concentrate. Before you know it, 
you will be singing along to the 
newest Backstreet Boys hit (I 
know everyone secretly knows all 
the words). My advice: go to 
Crema if you are able to block out 
even the coolest songs. 

The next stop in the Pacific 
Beach adventure is at Cafe 976. 
Cafe 976 is located at 976 Felspar 
Street. Cute, huh? 

If you are already suffering 
from caffeine withdrawal by this 
point, you have arrived at the 
right place. Cafe 976 specializes in 
excell~nt espresso drinks. The 
best are the white almond latte

THE EDITOR'S SOA.PBOX 
Modern conveniences no substitute for good communication skills 

BILL BURGER 
Sports Editor 

People skills are a dying art in 
our society. Hear me out. 

It was 7:45 a.m., and I was 
going to be late for class again. I 
woke up and hopped in the 
shower, put on clothes and ran 
to my car. Once I had parked 
and caught the North Parking 
shuttle, I was 20 minutes late 
and my professor had already 
assigned the homework that 
would be due next class meet-
ing. 

After class, I looked over at 
the person sitting to my left and 
asked for the assignment. Kind 
of befuddled, he rooked down, 
looked back at me, then asked 
for my e-mail address. I was 
now the one that was confused, 
but I played along and gave it to 
him. 

Later that day I checked my 
e-mail and there was the full 
assignment, including hints on 
how to do the more difficult 
problems. I was relieved to have 
the assignment, but the method 

by which this fellow c~ose t~ 
give it to me made me qUIte CUri-
ous. It is only when I got to 
thinking abou.t it i~~dep!h that I 
decided to write thIS article. 

We live in an Internet-domi-
nated society. For many of us, 
our primary methods of infor-
mation gathering include fax 
machines and e-mail. These 
mechanisms are helpful, but are 
we losing our ability to commu-
nicate? 

Don't get me wrong. The 
Internet certainly does have its 

ernet connection that attracts}C> 
many students to this cam'pus. 

As much as I try to fight this 
problem, I see it popping up in 
my own life from time to time. I 
remember when I went back to 
my parents' house during 
Thanksgiving break of my fresh-
man year. When I woke up on 
Friday morning, I automatically 
went over to the computer. 
Much to my dismay, my house 
didn't have the automatic con-
nection that my apartment back. 
in San Diego had. 

be keeping us doae. The strang. 
part was that when we would. 
get together, the conversations 
would lag ' and it would feel 
awkward, almost like I was talk-
ing to someone that .1 had never 
met before. ·1t was in dealing 
with this dying relationship that 
first made me realize how differ-
ent it is to relate with people in 
person than it is to deal with 
them through some machine. 

You caMot see emotion 
through a computer acreen. You 
also cannot place emphasis or 

We live in an Internet-dominated society. For many of

include fax machines and a-mail. 
purposes. For international com-
munication, e-mail can't be beat 
and Web sites are quick fixes 
when you need a shot of infor-
mation. But I ask you, how 
many of you freshmen ICQ your 
suitemates to ask them if they 
want to go to the cafeteria for 
dinner? 

Everybody always complains 
about the lack of a social envi-
ronment at UCSD. I think that 
other than the difficulty of the 
curriculum, you can attribute 
this problem to me rampant use 
of computers as well as the eth-

Another better example 
revolves around an experience I 
had with a good friend. We were 
very close in high school but 
now that we live in different 
parts of the state, we sometimes 

. don't talk as much as I would 
like. Because the costs of long 
distance telephone service and 
air travel are so high. we usually 
result to e-mail or America 
Online's Instant Messenger pro-
gram to communicate. 

Throughout our first few 
years at college, our conversa-
tions on the Internet seemed to 

portray sarcasm. It is an entirely 
different type of communication, 
and it is slowly taking the place of 
one-on-one human contact. 

It's true that being a wizard at 
C++ or JavaScript is something 
that will impress employers. but 
so will being able to construct a 
coherent sentence about your 
qualifications for the job. 

In today's society, we even 
rely on computers for a great 
deal of our entertainment. Going 
out with friends or family has 
been replaced to a great extent 
by sitting in front of the warm 

glow of a machine and zapping 
opponents in Quake II with a ray 
gun. 

I know this sounds like I am 
preaching about a return to 
times of old when people would 
sit around a fireplace at dinner 
and discuss the events of the 
day, followed by a good group 
reading and a cup of ho~ cocoa 
before retiring to bed. I assure 
you that I would not like that 
any more than any of you 
would. I am just saying that a lit-
tle balance would &e a nice 
change. 

Maybe actual conversation 
and interaction is too passe for a 
generation of people raised in 
the era of Nintendo and DVDs. 
Maybe our attention spans are 
just too short to deal with the 
faults of a real penon being on 
the receiving end of a question 
or COmmAnd. Jf that is true, thea 
maybe it is too late to change our 
ways. On the contrary, I think 
that we have just fallen into the 
comfort of being able to pre-
screen what happens before 
somebody else gets a chance to 
critique it. 

If so, then the Internet may 
eventually be able to return to 
its original purpose of being a 
tool to make life easier. 

Keep that in mind. As for me, 
I have to stop here - I need to 
check my e-mail and my stock 
prices before I update my on-
line fantasy basketball team.

Some say that everything in 
life returns full circle ... this 
explains how we have ended up 
at Ralph's. Although Ralph's 
may not be a conventional study 
destination, they have recently 
added a coffee shop and several 
tables. 

Still, there is no doubt that 
your best bet at Ralphs is a sand-
wich from the service del i. In 

taining than studying. 
Wherever you decide to 

study, don't become a prisoner 
of Geisel! Even if the closet next 
to the library lounge is available, 
go and find your own study 
nook ... you might even discover 
some great food in the process. 
And by the way, I was the one 
who studied in the closet, with 
my friends.

.~".",. ,.".-_ .. ORTS "." - .... ".., I -.~,..",. .,r. ____ ., _r-.... .c), D. leWIS 
By Brtan Welles 

In these high economic 
times - especially among pro-
fessional baseball players - it 
a ppea rs tha t the bickering for 
higher salaries and improved 
contract conditions is not 
exclusive to the guys hitting 
and throwing the ball. 

It seems umpires are also 
getting a taste for seizing 
opportunities to receive more 
collective bargaining rights 
and other labor benefits from 
their employment agreements 
wi th the league. 

Umpires! You wouldn't 
think right away when you 
watch Major League Baseball 
games on television that these 
sometimes overfed, overstuffed, 
white-haired officials are ques-
tioning their employers behind 
the scenes. As it turns out, the 
gurs who have to make the crit-
ica calls that determine the win-
ners and losers of our national 
pastime aren't actually going 
home after each game and hap-
pily drinking a beer (a lthough 
hopefully you and I are; we're 
college students and supposed-
ly we should be living it up dur-
ing these years.) These guy:; 
with stomachs that jiggle pro-
vide an example of how life is 
hard on the outside - even for 
a big league umpire. 

They went to umpiring 
school in some town in middle 
America or in a rural part of 
the country where the bars 
have straw and peanut shells 
on the floors. I mean, really, 
how often do you hear about 
an umpiring school in a metro-
politan region like L.A., San 
Francisco or New York? 

You would think that ump-
ing is a relatively easy skill to 
learn compared to being faced 
with the task of completing 
180 units at UCSD. I bet some 

"Of you would love to go live in 
middle America for a week 
and drink beer every night 
after returning from "umping 
practice." Sounds like a good 
vacation compared to the hell 
you are probably about to 
endure in the next two weeks. 
But to tell you the truth, 
umpires have problems too. 

Just take Richie Phil lips, for 
example: after last baseball 
season's end, he was the head 
of a union of umpires who 
called 'which called itself the 
Major League Umpires 
Association (MLUA). 

That all changed when the 
National Relations Board, after 
administering an election by 
mail, reporred on Tuesday that 
a vote of 57-35 were in favor of 
getting rid of the MLUA. The 
umpires of MLB were voting 
to determine what union 
would represent their needs-
the MLUA or the Major 
League Umpires Independent 
Organizing Committee. 

Unfortunately for Phillips, 
the 21-year leader of the 
MLUA, his organization was 
ousted by his fenow buddies in 
foul territory. The veteran 
umpire, who once headed 
major league umps in the 
seven-week strike in '79, the 
four-game strike in '84 and the

Championship Hopes Wither 
COLLAPSE: After playing well for two quarters in the NCAA finals, UCSD gets outscored by Stanford 
By Bill Bur,.r 
Sports Editor 

It was the kind of event that 
made sports fans think that they 
were at a Nebraska Cornhusker 
football game. Campus was 
buzzing all week long, while stu-
dents and faculty alike couldn't 
stop talking about the big water 
polo ball in front of Canyonview 
that symbolized that the NCAA 
Championship Tournament had 
arrived at UCSD. Adding to the 
excitement was the fact that the 
Tritons were one of the teams 
competing in the event. 

All signs pOinted to an epic 
event at Canyon view Pool this 
weekend. 

As it turned out, the event was 
an epic one, but not from the 
Triton point of view, as UCSD lost 
both of its games, taking fourth 
place in the nation. 

In Saturday'S first semifinal 
game, the Bruins of UCLA got out 
to an early lead and never relent-
ed as they defeated the 
Minutemen of the' University of 
Massachusetts 14-6. 

"We definitely weren't looking 
ahead," UCLA co-Head Coach 
Adam Krikorian said. "We knew 
IUMass was) a good team. You 
don't win 28 games without hav-
ing a very good team." 

With that win, the Bruins won 
a place in the . NCAA finals 
against the winner of the second 
match, which was between UCSD 
and the Stanford Cardinal. 

As the match began, the Tritons 
seemed poised to give the partisan 
crowd of 2,Q19 people what it 
came to see. The team got on the 
board first with a shot from a tough 
angle by Ryan Dandy. With 2:03 left

Deep .... : UCSD junior Jason Boettner, who contributed a two-point shot to give the Tritons an early 
lead over the Stanford Cardinal, plays keep away during the third place game. 

in the first quarter, Jason Boettner 
gave the Tritons a 3-0 lead with a 
two-point shot from eight meters 
out. Stanford got within two on a 
man-advantage goal, but the peri-
od ended with the Tritons up ~l. 

The crowd was temporarily qui-

eted, however, when Stanford's 
Jonathan Skaalen SC"Ored a two-
point goal with 5:44 left in the sec-
ond quarter to tie the game at three. 
Afterwards, Triton Jonathan 
Samuels quickly drew an ejection 
of Micheal Lipinsky of Stanford 

and scored off a pass from senior 
Ross Mecham to give the Tritons a 
4-3 lead. 

The Tritons and the Cardinal 
each scored one more goal in the
