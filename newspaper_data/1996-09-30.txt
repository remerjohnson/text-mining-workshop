4 OPrNlON 

After the demise 
of affirmative 
action, UC 
administrators 
establish 
guidelines for 
revamping the 
admissions policy 

The UCSD Guardian Monday, September 30, 1996 

PINI 

Rather than being based on merit, 
the new criteria are still not entirely fair 

By Chris Schreiber 
Editor in Chief 

A little more than a year ago the UC Regents, at the 
urging of Gov. Pete Wilson, did away with the ys-
temwidc affirmativc-at;tion policy that had been in use 
ince Bak.ke v. UC Regents was decided by the Supreme 

Court. Now, administrators at all UC campuses are 
scrambling to blunt the effect that the new mandate 
might have on minority enrollment by reworking the 
admission policy. University of California Office of the 
President (UCOP) admini strators have proposed new 
guidelines aimed at ensuring the diversity of the student 
body in the UC system. The new policy is scheduled to 
go into effect for students who enroll for Spring Quarter 
1998. 

While beHer Ihan the old affirmati ve-acti on model, ' 
Ihe new standards continue to be innuenced by a tribal 

ed. After the initial cutoff, where between 50 and 75 per-
cent of the availab le slots are given to those with the 
highest numerical credentials, applicants that meet mini-
mum UC numerica l standards but did not gain admission 
arc re-eva luated by using additional faclOrs, including 
factors o f the non-academic variety. 

Some o f these instruments bear an obvious relation-
ship to how we ll a tudent will compete and succeed in 
the rigorous envimnment of a UC campus. Factors such 
as completion of special projects, experiences that 
demonstrate unusual promise for leadership, special tal -
ents, achievements and awards in a particular field fit

COMMENTARY: Proposition 208 is just another arbitrary fund-raising obstacle that will not stop 
corruption and will only make it harder for political campaigns to get their message across 

CONTRIBUTION LIMIT SOLVES No PROBLEMS 
By Mike aeorCIno 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Last spring quarter, as r III sure 
at least some returning ' students 
remember, people consta ntly 
shoved peti tions in our faces as we 
walked around the Price Center. 

America's riche t industries, cor-
porations and individuals corrupt 
the political system by manipulat-
ing our politicians? If so, is it rea-
sonahle to set more limits on feder-
al campaign cont ribut ions'? 

Notable among the questions 
they asked was. " Do you want 10 
SlOp political corrupti on"!" T he 
petit ion that went along wi th this 
question proposed limiting federal 
campaign contributions to 200 for 
all constituent , be they individuab 
or corporations. nfortunately this 
petition made it on to thi s 

ovember\ baliOl a, Proposition 
208. 

Of course everyone wants 10 
stop politica l corruption, but anoth-
er arbi trary contribullon limit wi II 
not so lve any problems. In addi tion 
to placing unreasonable limitations 
on fund-raising, Prop. 208 is a mis-
guided elTon to solve a problem 
that doe 'n' t exi~1. 

Presently, most, i f not all. feder-
al electi ons are driven by con tribu-
tions from special-interest groups 
called Political Action Commillces 
(PACs). PACs are orga ni l.lItions 
established by corporations and 
indu~tries. The government already 
regulate), the,e organllati ons, 
who,e so le so le purpose is to 
donate money to political candi-
dates. 

In 1971, Congress pa,sed the 
Federal Elections Campaign Act, 
sell ing limits on the amount of 
money individuals and PA scan 
contribute to federal election cam-
paigns. Under thi s legislation an 
individual can uonate up to $ 1,000 
to a candidate, while a P C can 
contribute 5.000. 

By limiting total 
contribution 
amounts, the only 
clear 'beneficiaries 
will be Incumbents 
running for re-
election. 

The issue at hand is simple: Do However, even though the gov-

ernmcnt regulates contributi ons 
from PA s, ~ome people (such as 
I1Icmher~ of the Reform Party) 
would have us belie\-e that special-

orn new a 
ragtag collection of off-beat Individualists, thoroughly devoted to making the most of life as 
we possibly can. Part of that effort includes finding new people-to leam from, to hang out 
with, to conquer the world .. . you know. If you're like us, you want to do everything, to try 
everything, to understand everything. There is so much to do, and so few lives to do It In. The 
onty times we're bored is when we're stuck doing things we don't want to d~. Left to our own, 
we'll turn sand imo castles, napkins into unified-field theOries, and potatoes Into small Wither-
ing statues wearing funny hats. The common thread amongst us is something that IS, 
unfortunately, very rare: the desire to know the truth above all other conSiderations. To mas-
ter reality, you have to know reality. If you want to bend the world to your Will. you need to 
know how the world works. Even if the truth is not what you want to hear, it is better to know 
it than to deny it. Do you believe in mystical energies, and other things which are inherently 
beyond rationality? If so, don't call us. We don't invent excuses for the unknown-today's 
magic is tomorrow's science. Do you feel your welfare and happiness are anyone's respon-
sibility but your own? If so, don't call us! We believe everyone is responsible for hiS or her 
own welfare. Helping others should be a choice and a pleasure, never an obligation. Are 
you bored with people who don't see a fraction of the world you do? You're wondering 
whether you can blo-engineer a cow that makes chocolate milk, and they're worned whether 
or not their shampoo manufacturer uses animal testing. You're staYing up late to stretch 
time, and they're drinking beer to kill time. You're dressed for comfort and personal aesthetiCS, 
and they're herding with the fashion clones. If this sounds fam iliar, perhaps you should be 
hanging With us instead. Our interests run the gamut from cooking to high-tech research ,

agendas of Democrati c and

to remember is that PACs make 
their t;ontrihutions after campaigns 
have been cstablisheu. Thc r<!ality 
of the ' ituation is that groups and

UCSD SHOULD NOT CLO'SE HILLCREST FACILITY 
Editor: 

For whom docs the bell toll? 
Recent events at the UCSD 

Medical Center in Hillcrest remind 
us of the timelessness and timeli -
ness of 10hn Donne's insight. You 
may recall that when $2000-a-day 
consultants were brooght in to 
down-size the Medica l Center and 
hring its fi scal house in order, the 
result was the loss of ome 600 
jobs, permanent di sruption of 
many services, and mass demoral -
ization on the part of the Center 
personnel. 

The final hu mi liation for the 
laid-off workers was being escort -
ed by security peTsonnel rrom their 
offi ces or laboratories, in many 
cases places they had occupied for 
years. Ironically, the security per-
sonnel were themselves shown the 
same treatment by security people 
brought in from the outside. 

During this trauma, there was 
narY a peep or squawk from the 
UCSD community, not even the 
hand-wringing laments lhat might 
have normally been expected from 
the higher reaches of our adminis-
trative leadership. Most of us were 
too shocked and too scared to 
protest, merely thankful that we 
weren' t the ones being sacked. 

The latest news is that the clos-
ing of the Hillcrest faci lity is being 
considered seriously by our admin-
istrators in secret meetings with 
representatives from two large hos-
pital chains. 

Under most circumstances such 
a possibility would be inconceiv-
able. After all , the medical center is 
one of UCSD's success stories. 

Wi til the aid of tax dollars. and the 
broad support of the San Diego 
community, UCSD converted the 
old San Diego county hospital into 
onc of the most important medical 
centers in the nation. Hundreds of 
medical students, intern and resi-
dents have been trained there. The 
reputations of dozens of faculty 
members have been made there. 
Perhaps a sign of the madness of the 
times is that an inconceivable possi-
bility is now not only conceivable, 
but possible, maybe even likely. 

If UCSD leaves the Hillcrest 
facility, what will happen to its 
teaching miss ion'! It is highly 
unlikely that Thornton hospital, 
with its limited patient base, will 
be able to provide adequate train-
ing fac il ities for medical students. 
Leaving Hillcrest will mean that 
the medical school will exist in 
name only. I, for one, despite hav-
ing been a member of the medical 
school's admission and recruitment 
commillee for many years. would 
strongly discourage any student 
interested in medical school from 
applying here should the Hillcrest 
facility be closed. 

Even more importantly, what 
will happen to all the people that 
the Hillcrest facility now serves? 
Where will they go, and who will 
take them? There is talk (or maybe 
it has already laken place) of trans-
ferring the pediatrics unit from 
Hillcrest to Thornton. How will 
people get to Thornton? Hillcrest at 
least is accessible by public trans-
portation, but Thornton isn' t. 

The Hillcrest medical center is 
perhaps the most important health-

care provider in San Diego for the 
poor, the marginalized and those 
without medical insurance. In bet-
ter times UCSD accepted the 
responsibility to care for these peo-
ple. and it was rewarded with pres-
tige and resources. To abandon this 
mission now in more difficult 
times is callous and cowardly. 

Considering the importance of 
the issues, the secrecy that has 
characterized the recent meetings 
is extremely troubling. What 
options or proposals have been or 
are being considered'! Who is mak-
ing those proposals? Who has been 
consulted? The status of the med-

ical center. its mission and its rela-
tionship to the San Diego commu-
nity, is too important to be left to a 
few individuals. There is no doubt 
that the problems the medical cen-
ter faces are serious ones. This is 
all the more reason why these dis-
cussions have to be carried out in 
the open with broad participation 
from all segments of the communi-
ty. 

What is also troubling is how 
invisible our leaders have become 
at this critical time. Where are they 
now - our chancellor, our vice-
chancellors, our deans. our city and 
county po liticians - when we 
need them most? Where i their 
vision of a more equitable commu-
nity and a better futu re for those 
who come aft er us? Are they 
defend ing and fi ghting for the 
integrity of our institution and its 
commitment to its mission and to 
the community and society to 
which it owes its existence? 

A great crisis can sometimes 
elicit the best from a community. 
Are our leaders up to that chal-
lenge? Or will they se ll our future 
for the ephemeral gains in the bot-
tom line? 

Donne had it right - the bell 
tolls for us.

Textbook Co-op Asks 
For Student Support 
Editor: 

As many people are already 
aware, each academic quarter, the 

staFf or the General Store Co-op 
(Gsq has operated a Textbook 
Co-op, offering science. math and 
social-science textbooks at a sig-
nificant discount. As with all 
UCSD co-op ventures. we are not-
for-profi t. The goal of the co-op's 
venture is to offer a reasonably 
priced alternati ve to the other text-
book outlets on campus (with Ihe 
exception of Revelle Bargain 
Books, which operates within a 
consignment-only framework). 

Within the past month, it has 
come to our attention that the 
UCSD Bookstore has decided to 
discount the prices on most of the 
textbooks which the Textbook Co-
op carries, either matching or 
going below co-op prices. They are 
effecti vely entering into a direct 
price war with us. 

Contrary to what some may at 
first Ihink, we applaud any move 
by any UC-run, UC-owned busi-
ness to offer better deals to student 
and faculty consumers. In fact, 
were this practi ce to continue, we 
at the GSC would be forced to shut 
down the Textbook Co-op perma-
nently. The danger in this possibil -
ity, as we view it, is that these new 
prices offered by the UCSD 
Bookstore will not be permanent; 
as soon as the Textbook Co-op 
shuts down (a very real possibility 
in view of our limited stock and 
staff) the bookstore will once again 
raise their prices to standard profit-
making heights. 

In keeping with our lower-
than-the-Price Center guarantee. 
we have marked our books down

POLICY: 
Guidelines are dis-
criminatory 
Continued from pace 4 
ceed on a UC campus. I myself do 
not see much of an indication in 
either direction. 

And that is precisely the prob-
lem. These categories are aimed al 
promoting the diversity of the stu-
dent body, but they ultimately don ' t 
help in determining a student's pre-
paredness for the UC system. 
Students should be treated as indi-
viduals, not as the members of a 
certain group or class. 

In attempting to assure diversity 
by giving special preferences to 
tudents coming from this or that 

high school or socio-economic 
class, individual students lacking 
preferred characteri stics are dis-
criminated against. By awarding 
points to some students on the basis 
of factors that are unrelated to indi-
vidual achievement, factors based 
on background over which the stu-
dent has no control, the authors of 
the new guidelines are doing some-

thing which is no different in prin-
ciple than giving extra points to 
their friends' kids . They are picking 
some favored group and giving 
them a benefit that is not accessible 
to everyone regardless of race, sex, 
location or background. 

An individual who ha uperior 
potential for success (as indicated 
by relevant criteria such as GPA, 
SAT scores, awards and achieve-
ments) bUI does not obtain admis-
sion to the UC system merel y 
because of not belonging to the 
preferred class has suffered from 
discrimination. I am sure such an 
individual would not care a whit 
that because he did not obtain the 
desired spot at a UC, the cause of 
di versity within the UC system was 
furthered. As an individual, he was 
denied his rights. 

It is the habit of parents whose 
youngsters have done something 
naughty to remind the latter that the 
ends do not justify (he means. 
Examples of violations of this prin-
ciple include stealing a piece of 
candy from the store to give it to 
someone else, as well as lawyers 
gelling criminals off on procedural

An Individual who

system has suffered

technicalities. The principle also 
applies very well in this case. The 
ends, in this case obtaining some 
desired level of diversity in some 
category, do not justify the means, 
di scriminating against other quali -
fied individuals. To paraphrase 
Gen. Colin Powell , when someone 
is handed benefit s from special 
pri vileges. someone else is neces-
sarily di criminated against. 

This Jruth is even more evident 
in the case of the "special excep-
tions" who are provided for in the 
proposed standards. This group of 
up 10 6 percent of the entering UC 
freshmen class for a gi ... en year 
don' t even have to meet the mini -
mum UC numerical standards. 

Overlooking the obvious contradic-
tion with the definition of mini -
mum standards. there are major 
problems with this quagmire even 
above and beyond the obvious dis-
crimination. 

For some reason, the proposed 
standards deem it "essential" that 
UC campuses be able to admit a 
small proportion of students in 
exception to the eligibility require-
ments. The policy states that "stu-
dents admitted by ex(;eption to the 
eligibility requirement s must 
demonstrate a reasonahle potential 
for succe 's at the Uni versi ty." 

What exactly is it that the eligi-
bility requirements are measuring'! 
Oh yeah - potential for success in 
the UC system. And those admitted 
under a special exception from the 
minimum requirements supposedly 
have to demonstrate an ability to 
succeed and compete at the UC? 

With recent budgetary tighten-
ing and the attrilion of the faculty 
th rough early retirements and hir-
ing freezes. does the UC syslem 
really have the resources to know-
ingly bring in a group of students in 
need of remedial instruction? And. 

OPINION 7 

given a finite or even shrinking 
budgetary pie, whose programs 
will be cut to accommodate these 
needs? Is it fair to the rest of the 
students to use resources in this 
manner? I would say that it is not. 

If diversity within the UC sys-
tem is the goal , the root of the prob-
lem needs (0 be dealt with . 
Secondary and primary school edu-
cation in many areas of Californ ia 
is sub-par. and horribly so. The 
public secondary and primary 
schools are failing to properly pre-
pare many of those students with 
lower socio-economic backgrounds 
fo r the UC. 

ew ways of dea ling with thi s 
problem. such as the proposed 
UCSD Charter School. other char-
ter schools that are not under the 
auspices of the bureaucrats in the 
school districts and school vouch-
ers need to be experimented with. 
What docs not need to happen is 
the lowering of standards to cover 
up this failUi c In the name of 
achiev ing dI versity. It might be 
tougher to tackle the real problem, 
but it wi II be infinitely better for 
society in the long run to do so.

LETTERS: 
Continued from pace 6 
from a 22 percent mark-up to a 15 
percent mark-up. The fact is that 
the cost in time and labor to order. 
ship and check in books far ur-
passes the 15 percent mark-up on 
the costs of the books. Thus. 
should we fail 10 ' convince con-
sumers of the wisdom of inve ting 
their money in our cheaper pri es 
(writing a check out, for once. to 
someone other than the UC 
Regents), we will be forced to dis-
cont inue the operati on of the 
Textbook Co-op. By ' January of 
1997, the UCSD student will once 
agai n be faced with only one 
option in buying their books. As 
students ourse lves, our guess is 
that once the Textbook Co-op is 
eliminated, the UCSD Bookstore's 
prices will rise again. ' 

We at the General Store Co-op 
reali ze that the nature of the capital-
ist game is to lower and eventually 
regulate prices, making most goods 
affordable to the average consumer. 
Howevcr, in such an environment 
as the UCSD campus. with the lack 
of an open market replcte with 
competitive bu~inesses, it is impor-
tant to maintain and encourage any 
competition which could help thl: 
student save va luable money for 
other aspects of their educational 
experience. We therefore a~k you to 
~imply come and inve ·tigate the 
option we offer. Any member of our 
~tore would be more than willing to 
cxplain our operation. and any CU~ ­
tomer can be assured of the fact that 
we have no ulterior motives in set-
ting our prices other than to save 
~tudcnl S money. 

If the UCS D Bookstore really 
wants to offer a significant dis-
count, why did they not reduce 
prices on all of their books (i.e 
tho e which we do not carry) And 
why did they find it necessary to 
sell hooks ordered exclusively 
through us hy professors?

MONEY: 
Continued from page 5 
ries wi ll be incumbents running for 
re·election. Incumbents do not need 
enorl1lou ~ funds to make them-
selves known because they have the 
advantage of years of free press. If 
voters wish to see fresh faces con-
tending for government positions, 
they must enable candidates to raise 
the necessary amount of money. 

Another unfortunate miscon-
ception about the origins of cam-
paign funds is that the contribu-
tions come from and solely benefit 
America's elite. For example, when 
talk tuns to corporate PAC money, 
the industries usually mentioned 
are tobacco. firearms and insur-
ance. However, thousands of dol-
lars are also contributed by vic-
tims' groups, the handicapped and 
labor unions. If a candidate fa vored 
more government outlay to wheel-
chair acces in schools. few would 
fault a p litician from taking 
money from a PAC sponsored by 
the handicapped. However, in the-
same type of situation involving 
the ational Rille Association, 
many would criticize a candidate 
for taking money from them purely 
on the ba~b of the NRA'~ politic,. 

The sum~ of moncy eontnhuted 
to federal election campaigns arc 
not prohkmati<.:. While putllng an 
end to politica l corruption is. a wor-
thy goal, tightening contribution 
limits seems to he an alreadv-fai led 
olution to an ill-defined problem.

Teaching Assistants and Readers Air Their 
Concerns at GSA-Sponsored Forum 
DISCUSSION: 
Union claims TAs 
are treated unfairly 
By Mary Hlgelns 
ASSOCiate News Editor 

A fi ve-memberpanel discussed 
the rights and responsibilities of 
teaching assistants (T As) and read-
ers at Wednesday 's Graduate Stu-
dent Association (GSA) meeting, 
the first of the year. 

UCSD Office of Sexual Ha-
rassment Director Jun e 
Terpstra, Ethnic Studies Pro-
fessor George Lipsitz and As-
socia tion of Student Employ-
ees member and Department of 
Literature TA Kate Burns all 
spoke about the problems and 
responsibilities of TAs, tutors 
and readers at UCSD. 

Lipsitz. said that while gradu-
ate-student employees hilVe numer-
ous responsibilities, they often go 
unrecognized and unrewarded. 

"The cu lture of the university 
does not reward teaching," he 
sa id. " It does not allow us to ... 
talk about the work that goes into 
il. " 

Burns sa id that whi Ie T As are 
largely responsible forundcrgradu-
ate educat ion, they are not gi vcn 
the same considerations as other 
employecs. 

"[TAs are) workers that deserve 
basic working rights," she said. 

T As and readers ha ve com-
plained in the past about the lack 

of health care for dependentS and 
the inability to air grievances 
about workloads. 

"[The administration) claims 
they can look out for us. It is basi-
cally unethical... and illegal for the 
employer to have all the decision-
making power," Burns said. "We 
need our own representation." 

Burns argued that collective 
bargaining was the only way to 
help graduatc students ach ieve 
basic rights and that it would 
not diminish the quality of edu-
ca tion as the administration 
claims. 

"[TAs) are at the heart of un-
dergraduate educat ion," Burns 
added . " Profes-

"TAs in particular are the most 
vulnerable population in terms of 
sex ual harassment," Terpstra sa id . 
"TAs are often graduate students 
close in age both to students and 
professors - facilitating romantic 
relation [or potentially unwanted 
advances) ." 

Tcrp tra encouraged TAs to 
be "aware of recent laws" and to 
learn how to identify sexual ha-
rassment. 

"This is not about the offhand 
comment or dirty joke," she said. 
" It is a pattern of harassment be-
cause of sex or sexuality." 

Concern about workers' 
rights prompted ASE members 

to vote la s t 
sors depend on us 
for one-on-one 
contact [with the 
students.]" 

According to 
Lipsitz, T As per-
f0l111 "hundreds of 
tasks" and must 
maintain a profes-
sional relationship 
with s tudents 
while emphasiz-

"[Being a TA] Is 
about how you 
move the 
students from 

spring to strike 
this quarter, al -
though the date 
and duration of 
the s trike has 
not yet been de-
termined . where they are to 

where they need 
to be," 

Burns added 
that unfortu -
nately a strike

ing coo peration 
and classroom dynamics. 

"TAs must be allentive, pre-
pared and responsive," Lipsitz said. 
"[Bei ng a TAl is about how you

are to where they need to be."

lies include being educated about 
sexual harassment.

mailer in many courses . 

"[TAs) don 't want togoonstrike 
at all ," she said. "[t 's the lastlhing 
we want to do. We 'd like the 
administration to prevent that, but 
we need to take measures to assure 
rights be protected."

DOLE: GOP 
candidate says taxes 
harm families 
Continued from page 1 
editor fortheNationai Review, added 
thallhe money saved with Ihe fam-
ily lax credit can be put into IRA 
accounts for educational purposes. 

IRA accounts current ly have a 
2,000 limit , he said, but will be 

limitle 's under Dole' s plan 
The televised portion also fea tured 

a panel discussion that incl uded 
Forbes, Representali veJennifcr Dunn 
(R- Wa hington), Senator Spencer 
Abraham (R- Michigan) and fornler 
Reagan advisor Martin Anderson. 

AccordingtoDole, there have been 
no national tax cuts in the United 
States in 10 years. Though the 
candidale's proposed IS percent cut 
is "across-the-board," it does not in-
clude euts to Medicare or Social Se-
curity. Dole, a long-time supporter of 
government decentralization, said the 
cUI is intended lohelp struggling I' ami-
lies wi th their fi nances. 

"If both parents work, it should 
be because they want to, not be-
cause they have to," he said. 

According to a nationwide study 
by Americans for Tax Refornl, the 
total tax savings for Califomia would 
be more than $9 bi llion per year, which 
translates to $1,684 per famil y. 

"When Clinton says you can' t 
(cut taxes], what he means is he 
can' t do it ," said li ve paneli st Ernest 
Dronenburg, Jr. , Vice Chairman of 
the State Board of Equali zation. 

Though Dole's lax-cutting plan 
reminds many of fo rmer Pres ident 
Ronald Reagan's lax axi ng during 
the 1980s, the live panelists were 
quick to point out that Dole's plan is 
different. Unlike Reagan, Dole 
wants 10 decrease taxes without in-
creasing spendi ng, Kudlow said . 

To avoid future tax inc reases, 
the Republican plan incl udes a re-
quirement for a super-majority vote 
in Congress to raise income laxes 
and fo r reforming the Interna l Rev-
enue Service. 

Alludi ng 10 the controversia l 
Ca li fo rn ia Civil Rights In itiative, 
which wi ll appear on the November 
ballot, Ka loogian said tax cuts arc

gion or gender.

UNDERHANDED 
ADVERTISING CAN 

NO LONGER 
SUSTAIN TOBACCO 

COMPANIES 

1 magine for a moment: you are a top-rung executive for a bustling conglomerate -one whose product and namesake have been staples of American society for the 
majority of the century. Never mind what industry 
- for now, just imagine that your company controls 
a sizable chunk of the national market for the 
product. 

Now imagine that your sales are dropping 
drastically, especially in the Golden State where 
Californians have quit buying your product at more 
than twice the national rate. 

Conceive, if you can, of something called 
Proposition 99, which raises the tax on your product 

by twenty-five cents a unit - and that all of the 
proceeds of this "tax" are going to fund a broad 

campaign against your product. 
Picture the Surgeon General of the United 

States issuing a report that contends -
beyond a shadow of a doubt - that your 
product is deadly to the human body and 
results directly in the deaths of 473,000 
users every year. 

What would you do? 
Well, if you were an executive at 

Philip Morris, or one of a host of other 
conglomerates that manufactures 
cigarettes, you would do what any self-
respecting executive would - you would 

put together phony "research committee " 
of ostensibly independent scientists to 

dispute, and hopefully discredit, such 
findings. 

And just in case one of these sO-l:alled scientists 
actually happens to draw close to unearthing more 
damaging evidence against smoking, you would 
threaten to cut his funding to ensure that every iota 
of research he finds will leave you smelling like 
roses, right? 

Extreme times call for extreme measures, and for 
the cigarette industry, there is no time more extreme 
than the present.

NUMEROUS REPORTS, 
STUDIES SUPPORT SURGEON 

GENERAL'S CLAIMS 
moking causes 
lung cancer. heart 
disease, emphy-
sema and may 

complicate pregnancy" -
smokers are well aware of the 
Surgeon General's warning 
printed on the side label of 
every cigarette carton. 

The warning is reinforced 
by a plethora of studies 
reminding us that smoking is 
detrimental to the health of 
both smokers and non-
smokers. However, millions of 
Americans continue to light up 
every year despite both the 
rampant warnings of such 
agencies as the American Lung 
Association and new laws that 
are making smoking more 
difficult. 

Former Surgeon General C. 
Everett Koop said in a 1988 
report that although smoking is 
a matter of personal choice, the 
choice should be an informed 
one. 

The Informed Choice 
Former U.S. Senator and 

Secretary of the Treasury 
Lloyd Bentsen compared 
smoking with crossing the 
street. "When you get a 'don't 
walk ' sign at a busy 
intersection and have it 
flashing and you step off the 
curb anyway, you take a chance 
on getting run over by a truck," 
he said in a 1990 U.S. Senate 
hearing before the U.S. 
Committee on Finance. 

"But with smokini there's 
no ... truck that people can see 
rolling down the treet. So they 
may not appreciate the damage 
that smoking can do or they 
may be too young to worry 
about the long-term effects." 

He also added that the 
number of Americans who die 
each year from smoking-
related diseases exceeds the 
total number of Americans who 
died in World War H. Annually, 
one in five deaths is smoke-

related. 
Also illuminated in the 

Senate report was the fact that 
men who do not smoke live 
approximately 18 years longer 
than men who smoke cigarettes 
throughout their lives. 
Addiction 

Nicotine - a powerful 
pharmacological agent that acts 
in a variety of ways at different 
sites in the body - enters the 
brain after reaching the 
bloodstream. Once in the 
bloodstream, nicotine rapidly 
disseminates throughout the 
body. 

Nicotine interacts with 
specific receptors In brain 
tissue, initiating metabolic and 
electrical activity in the brain 
and causing skeletal muscle 
relaxation. Nicotine also 
affects the cardiovascular and 
endocrine systems, which can 
stunt growth in adolescents.

AS POPULARITY OF CIGARETTES 
DECLINES, CIGARS HAVE 

BECOME SYMBOL OF PRESTIGE 
he image of an 
attracti ve, healthy 
blond woman 
seductively pulling 

a drag from ·a long, siiver 
cigarette holder or a rugged 
cowboy riding the range with a 
hand-rolled cigarette dangling 
from his lips - these were the 
popular images that used to be 
associated with the smoking of 
tobacco. Elegant, attractive and 
sophisticated. Tough, rough 
and grown-up. 

However, since Surgeon 
General Luther Terry issued a 
report in 1964 linking smoking 
with various health ailments, 
the anti -smoking movement 
has been gaining momentum. 
Nowadays, when one thinks of 
that attractive blond puffing 
away on the cigarette, the next 
imagc likely to come to mind is . 
an iron lung or a hospital room. 

The most pronounced trend 
in the the discussion of tobacco 

is the increasing fervor of those 
calli ng for greater government 
regulation of cigarettes and 
smoking. Interestingly, this call 
for further regulation does not 
usually extend beyond 
cigarettes to the olher popular 
way to smoke tobacco: cigars. 

In fact, even as the 
popularity and puhlic image of 
cigarettes seems to be at an 
ex tremely low ebb, cigars are 
enjoying a rise in both 
popularity and respeclability. 
Many upscale restaurants have 
special cigar-smoking lounges 
and sell cigars from humidors 
behind the bar. The recently 
opened Seau" Restaurant in 
the Mission Valley Center has a 
walk-in humidor and a special 
bar in the lounge to ater to the 
cigar-smoking cl ientele. 
Moreover, specialty cigar 
stores are proliferating almost 
as rapidly as coffee houses and 
juice bars throughout the San 

Diego area. 
From conversations with 

cigar smokers and cigar 
vendors, those who indulge in 
cigars hold that smoking cigars 
is an experience completely 
di fferent than smoking 
cigarettes. The fact thai there is 
very little overlap between 
those who smoke cigarette~ 
and those who smoke cigars 
bolsters thi s point. In a 1987 
study on smoking and other 
tobacco 'use, the ational 
Center for Health Statistics 
(NCHS) found that on ly 7.8 
percent of male cigarette 
smokers smoked cigars 
regularly. Am ng female 
cigarelte smokers, the number 
was even more negligible. 

The bigg st difference 
between the two is the inhaling 
of the ~moke. With cigarettes, 
the smoke is drawn into the 
lungs and circu lated ,through

Exhibit A: the proponion of 
~ moker~ in California - the 
nation's largest state - has 
plunged from a 26.7 percent in 
1988 to a paltry 15.5 percent in 
1995, an all-timc low. 

Add to that the fact that the 
Food and Drug Administration is 
moving to regulate nicotine, the 
addictive substance of cigarellcs, 
as a drug. The Justice Depanment 
is investigating whether induslry 
executives committed perjury 
when they denied that tobacco is 
addictivc. States have filed suits to 
recover medical cxpenditures 
related to smoki ng. The list of 
barriers goes on and on. 

While the measures taken by 
the industry to preserve itself may 
he appa lling, hi story has shown 
that nothing i ~ beneath these 
e nterprise~. Traditionally, when 
the going gets tough, scruples go 
out the window. 

Of course, in addition to all of 
the legal problem, and the number 
of tho,e who quit smoking, there 
IS another dilllcuhy - namely,

most cunning of all - arranging

A Richard Kluger notlts in his 
non-ficti on book Ash~s to Ashes: 
America's Hundred-Year 
Cigarette War, the Public Health, 
and the Unabashed Triumph of 
Philip Morris, the conglomerate 
reponedly shelled out $42,000 for 
22 brief exposures of the 
Marlboro logo in the 1980 movie 
"Superman 11," including scenes 
in which Lois Lane had ' a 
Marlboro pack on her desk and 
was shown "puffing merrily 
away." 

Evidently, cigarette companies 
will do anything they can LO 
increase the e~posure of their 
product, and no wonder. In a 
business where rea l physical 
differences between brands are 
minor, keen marketing slralegies 
and the image behind the products 
are everything.

General 's repon, all tobacco 
products contain sub tantial 
amounts of nicotine. The amount of 
nicotine in the blood is si milar in 
people using different forms of 
tobaeeo. 

Approximately 80 per<:ent of 
smokers begin smoki ng before the 
age of 21. One out of four high 
school seniors who has smoked 
began when he/she was 12 years 
old. Doctors say that the elTon to 
quit smoki ng i more difficult [or 
those who start at a younger age. 

"Smokers may not believe that 
tobacco is addicling because of a 
reluctance to admit that one's 
behavior is largely controlled by a 
drug," Koop said. "On the other 
hand, most smokers admitlhat they 
would like to quit but have been 
unable to do o. Smoking is more 
than just Ii simple habit." 
Smokeless Tobacco

chewing tobacco - as an 
alternative to smoking i rising. 
However, tudies have proven that 
smokeless tohacco is not a

Cigarette smoking alone is 
responsible for 83 percenl of all 
cases of lung cancer and 30 
percent of all cancer-related 
deaths. Studies now reveal a clear 
dose- response relation ship 
between lung cancer ri sk and 
cigarettes smoked per day, degree 
of inhalation and age at initiation 
of regular moking. 

According to a study conducted 
by John Oates, a professor of 
medicine at Tennessee's Vanderbilt 
University, the risk of dying of lung 
cancer is 23 limes greater for tho e 
who smoke more than 40 cigarettes 
a day than the risk experienced by 
nonsmokers. 

The study bowed that subjects 
who reponed inhaling "none" or 
"slightl y" experience a risk of 
de ve loping cancer that is eight 
times greater than that of 
nonsmokers. The ri sk increased LO 
17 times greater for those who 
inhaled deeply.

cancer are greatest for Lhose who 
began smoking early in life. Some 
studies sugge~t that the duration of 
a ~moking habil, as oppo~ed to the 
number of cigarettes smoked, i~ the 
stronger determinant of lung cancer 
risk. Various studies also prove that 
initiation of smoking during teen-
age yea rs wi II have serious 
conseq uences for the ri~k of 
developi ng cancer. 

One study offered good news: 
the ri k of developing lung cancer 
is significantl y less for those who 
had smoked for less than 20 years

The San Diego Chargers - Monday, September 30, 1996 SPORTS 21 

THE 

midst a sea of yellow and 
blue, the Kan sas CilY 
Chiefs faced a challenge 
of hercu lean proportions. 
Their daunting task: To 

defeat the 3- 1 San Diego Chargers on their 
home turf bcl"ore a loud and hostile crowd 
and defy superstit ions by trying to win thei r 
13th straight contest against an AFC West 
opponent. 

After 60 minute of smash· mouth, 
tough-nosed , in·your-face, sock 'em·up 
football, all the aforementioned elements 
propelled the Chargers, allowing them to 
move into a ti e for first place with a 22- 19 
Will. 

" I thought it was a great, great game," 
Chargers' G eneral Manager Bobby Beat· 
hard said. "There was a lot o f pressure on us 
from the beginning of the game and every 
single time we scored, [Kansas City] put the 
pressure back on us. There was pressure 
from the opening kickoff to the final gun," 

Before a sellout crowd of 59.)84 rowdy 
fans, the Charger defense did not disap· 
point, stining Kansa City's ground attack 
and hounding Chiefs' quarterback Sleve 
Bono all day long. In improving thei r 1996 
home record to 3·0. the Chargers avenged 
last year's 22-7 drubbing al the hands of 
these same C hiefs, 

In that game, Kansas City tOlaled 166 
yards on the ground, but thi s time All -Pro 
linebacker Junior Scau and company 
SLUffed the run : limiting the Chiefs to six 
yards rushing in the first quarter, 34 yards at 
the half and 58 for the game. 

The Chargers iii up the scoreboard first, 
afler Kansas Cily failed to gain a first down 
on their first possession, Led by quarterback 
by Stan Humphries, San Diego drove down 

the fie ld with the help ofTony Martin's big 
third-down reception. Needing 14 yards for 
the fi rst down. Humphries connected with 
his standout rccei ver on an 18-yard pass 
play to keep th ~ drive going. Five minUies 
later, John Carney kicked his first of five 
iield goals on the day, a 33·yard boot. 
putting the Chargers ahead 3·0, The opening 
drive took ~ix minute and tOlalled 65 yards. 

Kansas City slarted their next offensi ve 
drive at its own 20·yard line and moved 
efficiently down the field, hUl on third and 
six from the Chargers' 44·yard· line. Steve 
Bono's pass wa~ tipped by safety Rodney 
Harrison and Junior Seau cradled the nut-
tering football for the game's first turnover. 

San Diego. however, could not capitali ze 
on the great licld positi on, and had to sellle 
for another Ca rney fie ld goal (38 yards). 
Kansas City showed that its ki cker is no 
slouch either. driving into San Diego territo-
ry three tirnc~ in the second quarter. Pete 
Stoyanovich was perfect on all three lield-
goal attempts (44, 26 and 25), but the Chiefs 
could not convert in the red zone and came 
away with a 9·6 lead heading into halftime. 

" Obviously we prefer lOuchdowns," 
Carney said. "But we did a grea ljob getting 
the ball close Ito the end zone 1 today and 
llIade it easier for me to make field goals." 

After a half dominated by the place 
kicker , San Diego looked to its offense for 
a boost, but all il got was a gentle push. 
Once again, San Diego drove down the 
field, only to settle for a field goal. Driving 
54 yards on 16 plays, Humphries connected 
with Andre Coleman on Ihree occasions, 
but the dri ve stalled on the K ansas City 26 
and Carney came through yet again with a 
44·yard boot, knotting the score al 9·9,

along, and the home crowd rc~tless, punt-
return extraordinaire Darrien Gordon gave 
the faithful Charger backers a reason to 
cheer, taking a Louie A guilar punt 81 yards 
for the Chargers' lone touchdown. Gordon 
nestled the hall in his grasp althe Chargers ' 
19 yard line. dartcd to the righl sideline. 
break.ing a tack le in the procc~s and hurdled 
another Chief would-be tackler down the 
sidelines to give San Diego a 16·9 lead, 

" It was a wall· right, my favorite return ," 
Gordon recalled. "r don' t know who it was, 
but he made me go really wide and he got a 
piece of me. but I was able to [stay on my 
feet] and the guys did a great job of block-
ing. I got to the sideline. and usually a 
returner [who makes it] to the sideline does 
not get caught." 

At a time when it looked as if the Charg. 
ers would start to run away wit.h it, the 
Chiefs answered right back on the next 
drive. On their lirM play from scrimmage 
after the Gordon score, future Hall-of· 
Famer Marcus Allen took a screen pass in 
the left nat at his own 30-yard line and dart· 
ed down the left sideline, before being 
taken down al the Charger three· yard line 
by Kevin Ross after a 59-yard gain. And 
after a time-out, Bono silenced the stunned 
crowd with a touchdown pass to tight cnd 
Reggie Johnson, tying the score at 16 all. 

Carney and Stoyanovich traded field 
goals again in the fourth quarter, and with 
seven minules remaining in the contest, the 
Chiefs began a drive in hopes of stealing the 
viclory away from the Chargcrs. Junior 
Seau, however, had connicting plans and 
came up with the biggesl play of Ihe game, 

" Junior is always everywhere," Allen 
said. "You have to respect someone who

CIGARS: 
Increasingly the 
finer side 
ContInued from INC. 17 
the respiratory system before being 
exhaled. When smoking a cigar, 
one takes the smoke into the mouth 
and holds it there. then blows it out. 
The smoke is not inhaled into the 
lungs. This difference is one of the 
reasons why cigar smokers have 
lower risk of developing lung 
cancer and respiratory illnesses 
than do cigarelle smokers. It also 
helps to explain why cigar smokers 
have higher risk of developing 
mouth and throat cancers than do 
non-smokers. 

Another difference between 
cigars and cigarelles is of what 
substances each is composed. 
Obviously, both do contain tobacco. 
However, cigars are made of only 
tobacco - the wrapper and tiller 
are tobacco leaves. Cigarettes have 

a paper wrapper and usually some 
sort of synthetic filler. In addition, 
since the tobacco in cigareucs is so 
loosely packed. chemicals and tar 
are added to the tobacco so that the 
cigarette can maintain its bum. 
Cigars are very tightly pac~ed and 
need no additional chemicals to 
bum. 

There also appears to be a 
difference in the perceptions 
surrounding cigars and cigarettes. 
The rise in the popularity of cigars 
has occurred at roughly the same 
time as a rise in popularity of 
certain alcoholic drinks such as 
single-mah scotches and martinis. 
Taken in sum, these seem to 
indicate a rise in popularity of 
items considered to be upscale, and 
items that were very popular in, 
and tended to be associated with, 
the I 950s, the pre-Baby Boomer 
years. 

This may be due to the type' of 
people smoking the cigars. Again 
citing the 1987 NCHS study. the

or to be a regular cigar smoker. That 
same study also howed that those 
who were married were most likely 
to smoke cigars, and those who had 
never married least likely, with 
divorced/separated and widowed 
people in between, in that order. 

Cigarettes, meanwhile, seem to 
get associated with beer - usually 
cheap beer. This probably isn ' t too 
surprising gi ven that cigarette 
smokers are more than three times 
more likely than members of the 
general population in general to 
consume beer five or more times 
per week. As evidenced by most 
fraternity parties, the quality of the 
beer purchased is usually inversely 
proportional to the quantity. 

The numbers on cigarelle 
smokers trended in the opposite 
direction as those of cigar smokers. 
Current and former cigarelle 
smokers accounted for 48.2 percent 
of all respondents to the NCHS 
survey with incomes below 
$10,000 a year, and 67.8 percent of 

Mooday. September 30. 1996 

those respondents who had 
completed - less than 12 y~ars of 
formal education. Those in the 
higher income and education 
brackets were much more likely to 
have never been a cigarette smoker, 
or, if they had, to be former rather 
than current smokers. 

Given their image problem, it 
becomes easier to see why 
cigarette have become such a 
large target for reform and 
regulation efforts. The political 
b~cklash against the tobacco 
indlfstry and smoki ng, especially 
smoking by those below the 
minimum age allowed by state 
statutes, was a major theme of the 
Democratic Party 's national 
convention. Local and state 
governments have also been 
increasing regulations on where 
smoking is permilled to occur. 
Many restaurants, buildings, and 
even outdoor venues such as sports 
stadiums are now under locally

but had not smoked for 10 years. 
Oth.r Smoklng-R.lated 
DI.ea ••• 

A 30-year-old smoker will 
reduce his life expectancy by about 
one-fourth. 

Cigarelle smoking is one of the 
major independent risk factors for 
heart allacks. Smokers run two to 
four times the risk of dying from 
sudden cardiac arrest. 

Epidemiological evidence has 
confirmed that cancers of the 
larynx, oral cavity and esophagu 
are directly related to cigarette 
smoking. 

Cigarette smokers run a relative 
risk of two to three times that of 
nonsmokers for developing bladder 
cancer. 

It has also been found that there 
is a positive association between 
smoking and kidney cancer. with 
relati ve risks ranging from one to 
more than five times that of 
nonsmokers. 

Pancreatic cancer mortality is 
attributable to cigarelle smoking. 
Cancer of the stomach is also 
associated with smoking. 

There is also an increased risk 
of cervical cancer for smokers as 
compared to non-smokers. 

Peripheral vascular disease -
the narrowing of blood vessels 
carrying blood to leg and arm 
muscles - is almost exclusively 
confined to smokers. 

Smokers suffer a risk 30 times 
greater than the non-smoker of 
developing chronic obstructive 
lung disease (COLD). 
Secondhand Smoking 

The decision to smoke affect 
more than one person. Studies by 
the Environmenlal Protection 
Agency (EPA) have estimated that 
500 to 5,000 nonsmokers die 
annually of lung cancer caused by 
others' cigarettes. According to the 
EPA, this makes secondhand 
tobacco smoke the nation's most 
lethal carcinogen. 

A 1984 study conducted in 
Japan showed that nonsmokers 
who live with smokers inhaled 
significant amounts of nicotine. 
According to the study, if a 
nonsmoker's spouse smokes two 
packs a day, the nonsmoker ends up 
with the same amount of continine 
- the hreakdown product of 
nicotine - as someone who 
smokes up to three cigarettes a day. 

Women who smoke while 
pregnant may give birth to 
unhealthy or premature babies. 
Nicotine in the mother's 
bloodstream has been shown to 
increase the chance of sudden 
infant death syndrome. 

Furthermore, women who 
smoke are more than Ihree times as 
likely to have a heart aJtack a~ 
women who have never sllloked. 

It was estimated lhat if all 
pregnant women stopped smoking. 
the number of fctal and inrant 
deaths would be reduced b 
approximately 10 percent -
approximately 4.000 fewer infant 
deaths in America each year. 

A UCSD study found lhat 
nonsmokers exposed to 
secondhand smoke from their 

• • colleagues for 20 years had about 
the sallle degree of impaired lung 
function a~ someone who smoked 
ten cigarettes a day for 20 years.

E~ECS: 
Declining industry 
target yo~th 
Continued from page 18 

Philip Hills , author of 
Smokescreen: The Truth Behind the 
Tobacco Industry Cover-LIp, says 
ye~, mainly beca use of the 
audience that companies are slyly 
targeting. 

" It is not possible to run a 
cigarette business with ut actively 
working the sidewalks where the 
children are," he wrote. 

In the eye of many critics of 
the cigareue industry, these 
advertising campaigns and the 
mogu Is that create them are 
unmistakably reprehensible 
because they target children - an 
audience, presumably, that is 
extremely susceptible to media, 
and a group that is eagerly awaiting 
adu lthood and see cigarettes as a 
shortcut to that goal. 

Such an argument might be 

If .. 

easily dismissed if the statistics did 
not line up so formidably behind it: 

Surveys show that 90 percent of 
all smokers had taken up the habit 
by the age of twenty. Further, the 
power of advertising, and the 
tendency to aim at children, is 
illustrated by a survey quoted by 
Kluger that found that 90 percent 
01 all six -year-olds knew thai Joe 
Camel was associated with 
cigarelles. 

According to Hilts, a relevant 
factor in lhe overwhelming 
vul nerability of the younger 
generation can be found in the 
"forbidden fruit" aspect of 
smoking. As the child reaches 
adolescence and begins to desire 
independence for the first time, 
naturally, a symbol normally 
associated with adulthood is 
sought, one with which 
independence can be asserted. For 
many, that symbol is the cigarette. 

An additional thri II is provided 
by their parents' efforts to thwart 
the cigareue habit, and thus the act 

The UCSD Guarllian 

In the e,e. of man, 
crnlcs of the 
cigarette Industry, 
the .. advertising 
campaigns and the 
moguls that create 
them are 
unmlstakabl, 
reprehensible 
becau .. the, target 
children - an 
audience that Is

media and eagerl,

itself becomes some sort of covert 
operation. 

Of course, as these teenagers get 
older, the "cool" clement of 

eigarenes begins to lose ils 
impelus, but by that time, 
according to Hilts, the addictive 
effects of nicotine have kicked in. 

" I started because it was ' ths: 
thing to do," one teenaged boy is 
quoted as saying. "Bul now it 
doesn ' t maner .... Now it 's just a 
habit." 

With the Clinton adminiMration's 
recent allempts to further restrict 
cigarette ales to minors by blocking 
access to vending machines, the 
death knell may finally be sounding 
for the cigareue industry. 

But to say that people begin 
smoking merely to achieve 
maturity is to ignore another 
important factor, one that inilially 
led to their popularity in the 1920s 
and 1930s, before the health risks 
were recognized - cigareues 
provide a neatly packaged, highly 
satisfying and mildly stimulating 
drug for coping with the ever-
increasing stress and anxiety that 
have become firmly ingrained in 
everyday life.

CIGARS: 
Finer alternative

origi nated smoking bans. States 
such as Utah even have 
proxi mity bans, stating that 
smoking cann t occur within 50 
feet of the entrance of certain 
buildings. 

The latest development on 
the tobacco front is Pre idenl 
Clinton's attempt to put 
cigarettes under the jurisdiction 
of the Food and Drug 
Administration, a move he 
justifies by clas ifying the 
cigarette as drug-de li very 
systems for nicotine. Whether 
or not the court will allow this 
remains to be seen, but given 
Clinton 's skill at reading the 
mood of the populace, it would 
seem that more regulations and 
rules are in store for smokers in 
the future.

chi Idrcn whose parents smoke) are 
more likely to uffer from lung 
problems than those Who are not. 

Eye irritation - the most 
common complaint of healthy 
people exposed [0 secondhand 
smoke - causes a delay in the 
recovery of vision following a 
g lare, which can impair one's 
driving. 

Passive smokers also experience 
nasal congestion. headache, cough, 
sore throat, hoarseness, di zziness, 
nausea, loss of appetite, fmigue and 
irritability. Tobacco smoke also 
exacerbates the harmful effects of 
dangerous physical and chemical 
agents that may be present on many 
indu trial companies' job si tes. 
Financial Effects 

According to the Surgeon 
General's study, smoking co ts our 
nation $65 bi Ilion in health care 
co ts, which i an annual per-capita 
l.:ost of $221 for smoking-related 
diseases.

estimated $4 billion on advertising 
and promoting tobacco use. II 
maintains that advert ising effo rts 
are directed only toward potential 
brand-switchers and denies that il 
targets racial minorities, women 
and underage smokers. 

The U.S. Senate said the claim 
was "absurd" and ci ted various

SEVEN: UCSD 
extends its win streak 
Continued from page 40 
granted a penalty kick, allowing 
Hetheri ngton to core his eighth goal 
of the season wi th ea~e overlhe line 
of SC players. 

" La~t year, I was siill getting 
over my knee surgery, bu t now l've 
got my speed back," Hetherington 
said. "I only had like three goals lasl 
year, so I'm definilely happy aboul 
how thing are going." 

Unforlunately, CC prevented a 
shUlout, scori ng a late goal on a 
Triton defense that la!;ked the same 
early game inten tty, but the 4-1 
victory was already in the bag for 
UCSD. 

Four days later, the Tritons took 
the !ield against Whi tt ier College. 
UCSD was comi ng off a big win. 
and may have been a little too re-
laxed al Ihe ~Iart or the game. 

"(Whitti er) is a Division III 
leam," said A~,istanl Coach Ted 
Przybylck. 'This is a game you 
have to win." 

Maybe the Tritons knew Ihat in 
their mi nds. but only after Ihe Poet, 
scored the !irst goal or the game did 
Ihe Tritons rea lize the importance 
of wi nn ing the match. 

"They sco~ed first," said forward 
Michae l Hami lton. "That was kind 
or a wake-up call ror us." 

Wake up was what the Tritons 
did, scoring all of the next ni ne 
goals with litt le contention from a 
disappointed Whittier squad . The 
game also proved to be exciting for 
the team becau~e many of the goal ' 
were the first or second forthe scorer 
thi s season. 

A diving Turner kicked the ba ll 
off the post, and Fong put the re-
bound pas I the goal ie for the fi rst 
goa l of the game by UCSD. Despi te 
tyi ng the score at I- I, the Tri tons 
weren' t goi ng to let their guard or 
intensity down again. Turner wa lked 
away from the goal, and instead of 
celebrating, got ready for thei r next 
drive for a score. 

"We just came olll low like we 
think can just wa lk out on the fie ld 
and bea t teams." sa id Turner. ''This 
was like a rea lity check, and they 
were beating us al one point. That's 
prelly sad." 

The passion paid off when John 
Brandon headed in a pass from 
Cameron Adams on the left side, 
giving UCS D the lead 2- 1. Ferber 
fo llowed Brandon'sgoal with adri ve 
up the righl side before passing in-
side to Hetherington for the thi rd 
goa l of the day. 

Jose Ocampo scored in the 57th 
minute, bringing the score lO 4-1 
before his second goal of the day in 
Ihe second half, thanks to an a 'sist 
by Fong. 

The Poet's goalie blocked a shot 
by Hetherington, but he was unable to 
stop Ferber from placing the rebound 
perfectly in the net forthe,ixth ti me in 
Whi ttier's nightmare match. 

Adams scored from the lefl side, 
followed hy Jacob Bollinger. who 
set himsclfupin fron lofthe goal for 
his first goal of I hc \cason, widen· 
ing the gap al X-I . 

As the Poets walked down the 
field ne,lr the end of the longest 
game or their ,cason, Douglas 
McBride kicked the ball out of the 
goalic ', gra\(J bef~ rc Aleks Glcbov 
put in the rina l goal of Ihe day, 
putting the Poets out of their misery . 

UC D faces Cal LUlheran today 
at 5 p.m. at the Triton Soccer La-
dium, h ping to improve again on 
their 7-2 record and take thei r win-
ning streak to eight in a row.

Tritons Crash and SETBACK: Su lost for entire season showed tha! she has what it takes to run the Triton offense by dishing out71 assists. Ripken made the most of the opportunities given to her by 
using her southpaw hilling style to 
rack up a team-high 23 kills. 

. . 

Burn at AFA Invite Continued from p.,e 40 second game out of reach. After the injury to Su, the Tritons were unable to hold form, dropping the next two games. The UCSD frontline, led by Noonan and senior Christine Chi, combined to record 12 team blocks 
and provide the necessary disrup-
tion to the opposing offense. ALTITUDE SICKNESS: The UCSD polo team's trip to Colorado 

Springs proved to be unpleasant as the Tritons returned home winless 
"We' re not going to use any-

thing as an excuse," McFarland said. 
"We just went nal." 

The team made sure itdidn ' tstay 
nat for long as they traveled to Cal 
State San Bernardino to face off 
with the Coyotes. The Tritons found 
themselves in the middle of another 
tight match, with each game being 
decided by slim margins. 

The victory improved the team's 
record to 10-4 and ga ve McFarland's 
squad another win against a quality 
Division II opponenl. The Tritons 
next host the UCSD lnvitational, 
which will be held at RIMAC on 
OCI. 5 and 6, and will feature top 
Division III teams from around the 
country . 

By Steve Walsh 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

Looking to face some of the 
top water polo squads in the na-
tion, UCSD traveled to the Air 
Force Academy Tournament in 
Colorado Springs with hopes of 
regaining the form which led the 
team to a third-place finish 
at last year's NCAA Cham-
pionships. 

Facing a field flooded 
with teams ranked in the 
top 10, the Tritons were 
able 'to see how they 
stacked up against their 
Division I rivals. The re-
ception in the mile-high state was . 
not a friendly one. 

UCSD opened its tournament 
play against the hosting Falcons 
of the Air Force Academy, a squad 
the Tritons defeated to clinch the 
Western Water Polo Association 
Championships, en route to last 
year'sNCAA's. The military men 
saw to it that the team did not 
enjoy its stay as they avenged 
their last defeat. 

Despite three goals 'from 
Romas Kudrika and two from 
Jason Boettner, the Tritons were 

unable to keep pace. The Falcons 
soared away with the win, 16-10. 

That same afternoon, UCSD 
returned to the pool to face off 
against Santa Clara. After falling 
behind early, the Tritons came to 
within three goals at the end of 
the third period, bllt could not 

close the gap and lost, 15-
I I . Despite three goals each 
from Adam Bollenbach and 
Gordon Beb, one a two-
pointer, Santa Clara proved 
too much for UCSD to 
handle. 

As rough as Saturday 
was, Sunday proved to be 

no easier for the Tritons. In their 
first match of the day , UCSD 
faced a squad from UC Davis, 
who were vic-

chored the Triton offense, with 
each picking up a pair of goals in 
the loss. 

UCSD had the pleasure of 
closing out its play in the Air 
Force Tournament by facing de-
fending National Champion 
UCLA. 

The No . I ranked Bruins 
showed why they were given that 
ranking by shutting down the Tri -
ton game plan . Three goals each 
by Kudrika and Chris Proietti 
were not enough to jump-start 
UCSD's offense. The Bruins hc,:ld 
the Tritons to a si ngle goal in the 
first period and only eight total 
for the game.

high altitude of Colorado provided

San Diego. I've never seen that many 
mesh hats, NASCAR shins and cups 
of cheap beer in one place. With thou-
sands of these people in one place 

If overcoming adversity is the 
sign of a champion, the Tritons 
have faced the first challenge and 
have shown that they are up to the 
task. 

you're destined for a ton of laughs. 
The best of the best was a man we 
called "Dancing Homer." This guy, 
who obviously had his share of the 
cheap beer, entertained the crowd 
between races with stupid tricks like 
trying to put his leg behind his head 
and leading others in his own version 
of the "Macarena." 

So if you're looking for a good 
time on the weekend, the Cajon 
Speedway is a definite diamond in 
the rough. Some people might argue 
that it's not a sport but you'd be hard 
pressed to find anything as enter-
taining as a demolition derby. And 
if you happen to see "Mad Dog" or 
"Dancing Homer," tell them thanks 
for the great time.

Tritons Sprint Past Field At UCR Invite 
THROUGH THE HEAT: UCSD overcame fatigue and extreme conditions to capture the overall tit~e at the Riverside Invite. 
By Kevin Mclaughlin 
Staff Writer 

Foremost among the goals of the 
UCSD cross country team this season 
is a lrip to the National Champion-
ships in Illinois. For the men, this 
would be the continuation of 
an important tradition. For the 
women, Nationals would sig-
nify the completion of a inten-
sive building process. With ' 
their performances this past 
weekend, both squads took 
large teps toward achieving 
their ultimate goals. 

On Saturday, the Tritons traveled 
to the UC Riverside Invi tational for 
the fourth meet of the season. The 
meet was a preview of the conference 
I.:olllpetition in Southern California, 
and if it was an accurale preview of 
the Triton squad, then high hopes will 
indeed bc ju~ti fied. 

The men's team lini ~hcd first over-
all. led by th.:strong running of Gavin 

'"Gunslinger" Klinger and team cap-
tain Rhodes Walton. Klinger,. who 
Triton Head Coach Ted Van Arsdale 
referred to as "oneofthose guys who' ll 
help us get back to Nationals" fin-
ished seventh overall, while Walton, 

in 200th place at the one-mile 
mark, stonned past the finish 
line in 13th place. Junior Neal 
Harder, continued his return 
toward last year's racing form, 
placing 21st and senior Bryan 
Leek gave the Tritons fourrun-
ners in the top 30. 
Hardworking sophomores 

Franzwa Achie and Josh Levin-Soler 
stepped up to finish fifth and ixth for 
the team, adding necessary depth. 

The men' s team has had four dif-
ferent runners finish in first place this 
season, a precedent which bodes well 
for the future - if one runner has an 
off day, there will undouhtedly be a 
capable pair of feet to take over. Ad-
ditionally. the"WahonGaJlg"(a~ Van 

Arsdale has dubbed the men's team) 
presents opponents with a balanl.:ed 
auack from runners one through ten, a 
must for team success in cross coun-
try. 

Meanwhile,thewomen'steamalso 
had an excellent race, finishing fourth 
in the 23-tealll field. The team fin-
i hedonly25pointsbchindthirdplace 
Clarclllont.Mudd-Scnpps, a strong 
team that placed fourth at the Division 
ill Nationals competition last year. 

Leading the pack was Kri ten 
"Kiki" Koenig in 26th with Maggie 
Dwire jumping from fifth place last 
week to econd this meet, coming in 
only four seconds behind Kocnig to 
finish 2 lh overall. Freshman Meghan 
SCOII mna personal besttime of 19:47 
over the 5k course to strengthen the 
JlOwerfultrio up fronl. 

But it was the tight grouping of the 
squad, with eight runner lini~hing 
under 50th place, th ai gives fuel to the 
fire of' optimi~1ll about Ihis tealll ' ~ 

chances. 
"Every girl has something unique 

to add to the team," aid Dwire, add-
ing that the chemistry of thi year's 
team is much improved over last year. 

Incredibly, this meet aw five rac-
ers place in the all-time top 10 for 
UCSD on the Riverside course, a re-
markable feal. Van Arsdille believes 
this meet was "indicative of what the 
team is capable of doing." 

The upcoming Stanford meet will 
be another step up in competition for 
the Tritons as they compete against 
lOp Division rand II teams from many 
we ·tern and midwestern states. But 
this year's team has the conlidence 
that it will only be climhing another 
rung on the ladder in a return to the 
Nationals. 

Harder slimmed up the feelings of 
the entire squad in sayi ng, "We fin -
ished 10th in ationals l a~t year. We 
expect 10 gotu Nat ionab again and w~ 
should improve un last year' s finish ." 

The Hammer: Senior Bryan 
Leek has made himself a racer 
to fear in leading the Tritons.

Toros BuII-y Their Way Past Sluggish Tritons 
D·IVISION II: Eighteenth-ranked Cal State University, Dominguez Hills proved too much for UC San Diego to handle on 
Wednesday night, scoring a goal in the 83rd minute and handing the home team its first defeat of the 1996 campaign, 
By Sean Rahlml 
Sports Editor 

The fo recast for Wednesday 
night' s showdown bet ween the Tri -
ton women's soccer team and Di -

vision II al State 
D o m inguez H i ll s 
called fordark kies, 
showers and a ti ght 
game - and each 
predic tion came to 
fru ition. BUlla the 
dism ay of UCSD 
fans, theToros came 

out on top of the duel, defeating 
the Tritons 2- 1 on a late goa l by 
Moll y McBride. 

Heading into the cont est versus 
the 18th-ranked Toros, UCSD had 
not allowed a single goa l th is sea-
son aDd was rid ing a 15-game win-
ning streak dati ng back to last 
year' s tit le run . The 1995 NCAA 
Division III National Champions . 
had tal l ied 22 goa ls on their way to 
a perfect 6-0 Sl art , but came up 
against a lough CSUDH squad. 

added to us not playing well. They 
caught us of f-guard and we spent 
the fi rst hal f try ing to get every-
th ing together." 

CSUDH ca pitali zed on the 
shaky Tri ton play 34 minutes into 

the game when Heather Rolland 
netted the fi rst goa l fo r the Toros 
off a free k ick, pUlling her team up 
1-0. 

Heading into hal ftime, the Tri -
tons found themselves trailing for 

the fi rst ti me this season. Conse-
quentl y, the . quad came out ready 
to play beller in the second hal f. 
10 minutes into the second half 
they answered right back when 
junior midfi elder- forward L auren 

Johnson curved a 
corner kick from 
the left flag, past 
Taro goalkeeper 
Brandy Kaake, to 
ti e the gam e at 
one. 

" Our pl ayer s 
were doing their 
j ob - maki ng 
su re the goal-
keeper was preoc-
c u pi e d ," 
Ocegu era said . 
" We played a lot 
beller in the sec-
ond half but we 
just got unlucky 
on a coupl e of 
pl ays. " 

After notching 
the ty ing goa l , 
UCSD rode Mr. 

M omentum and came c lose to scor-
i ng the go -ahead tall y several 
times. Bu t, their efforts onl y" pro-
duced a few near misses. 

Johnson dribbled past a co uple 
of defenders inside the box, look-
ing for a penal ty kick. She was 
taken down inside the penalt y 
area,but Ihe referee did nOI make 
the cal l. 

CSUDH struck back wi th onl y 
six minutes to play, scoring the 
eventual game-wi nni ng goal when 
M cBride volleyed in a cross from 
Roll and to up the score to 2- 1. 

UCSD tried valiantl y to ti e the 
conte t, but i t was too lillie too 
late. 

" It was a slap in the face and 
woke us up becau e we had never 
been traili ng in a game before," 
Oceguera sa id. " ] think we' ll be 
ready for Cal Lutheran [today]. " 

B oth UC SD socce r teams 
squ are o ff again st ri val Cal 
Lutheran University today at Tri -
ton Soccer Stadium . The men's 
squad plays at 5 p.m. while the 
women take the fie ld at 7 p.m. 

The Toros came out of t he gates 
quickl y in the f irst hal f, control-
ling the ball in the T riton half of 
the fie ld. UCSD seemed a bit nat 
and sluggi sh in the early going.

" We weren' t mentally ready for 

a hard 8ame," jun ior fullback

You're 8-A-A-A-A-A-
A-CK! 

And guess what ... so are we! Like 
the sweetest dream, or for that mat· 
ter, worst nightmare that you've ever 
had. We are back at you! Here to 
please you, tease you, and give you 
everything you'd ever want in a com-
petitive/recreat ional sports setting. 

Let's face itl We just don't go 
away! Cuz you don't want us to! 
We're too much fun, too much relief 
from the rest of the stress that this 
wonderful university puts on you. 

It's time to get real! You need us 
and we need you . Without that in-
toxicating mix , this place would 
shrivel up and die. 

And so now that we're all back, 
let gear it up! We've got another 
exciting sports filled quarter awaiting 
you. With plenty of the same 01' 
stand·bys Ihal you've come to love 
and hate in the same breath. And 
hopefully, a few new things to kick 
around when the opportunity pre-
sents itself. 

Intramural Sports at UCSD is 
YOUR program. Take advantage of 
it. Check out the leam sports sched· 
ule printed below and gel involved. 
Ta lk it up with your friends and form 
a team in as many activities as you 
can handle. Come by RIMAC and 
pick up a UCSD Recreation Maga· 
zine that further outlines how to ac· 
cess our program. 

We've tried to make it easy. Just 
call for a Registration Priority Num-
ber the morning of the Registration 
Meetin'g (check schedule fo r call-in 
periods) , com e to the afternoon 
meeting, and voila!. .. your team is in 
and playing on a weekly basis. It's 
as simple as all thatl 

Your hard-work ing Intramural 
Sports staff takes care of the rest. 
We'll be out there every step of the 
way with you throughout Ihe season. 
Ready to give you a helping hand 
when you need il! Ready to fire a 
well·deserved scud in your direction 
when you need Ihal, 100. Our only 
goal is to make sure you have fun, 
and 1015 of it! 

Fall Quarter is just the start . We 
wanl 10 see you all year! Come by 
for a chat , check us out for employ-
ment opportunities, or just come by 
to say hi and tell us what a great job

week, a great quarter, and a great 
year!

HELP WANTED! 
We're looking for over 100 students this year who want to have fun, meet people, get involved 

in sports and BE THE BOSS! That 's right. You get to be in charge. No entry level bologna. You 
start off calling the shots. 

Best of all you get to make your own work schedule on a weekly basis. Oh, and did we mention 
it is one of the highest paid jobs on campus. You 'll be making about $9 an hour while you 're 
having a great time. Sounds too good to be true? It 's not. Just what are we talking about ........ . 

It's simple. The Intramural Department needs lots of guys and gals with great a"itudes to 
officiate hundreds of 1M games that take place every week. Don't worry if you are a li"le thin on 
experience as a sports official, we'll take of that. The basic qualifications are that you love sports 
and working with people. We have extensive training programs that will get you ready to go out 
and blow your first whistle or throw your first flag. 

OK, maybe there are some drawbacks. There will be a couple of times when fellow students 
might refer to your family in a less than positive light or comment on your mental capacity during 
a game. But that's OK, cause you always get the last laugh. All you have to do is slap 'em a T, fire 
up a red card or give them the thumb and directions to the showers. 

The first week of each quarter is when the hiring and training takes place so check with our 
offices on the 4th floor of RIMAe (534-3716) or look for the posting on the job board. Right now 
we are looking for football and tube·polo officials for the season that begins on Friday. Get 
involved and get paid, What more can you ask for!
