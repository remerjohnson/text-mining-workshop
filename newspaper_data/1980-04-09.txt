UC ··Affirmative Action in Hot Water

Assembly Sets Up Committee on Each Campus to Assess Results

univeraity?" said Lozano. action program at UC, as it does for the &tate and 
community colleges. 

Disturbed by the ineHectiveneas of UC affinnative 
action programs, the Assembly Ways and Means 
SUbcommittee voted yesterday to cr~te a committee 
on each of the nine UC campuses to report directly to 
the legislature on how the university's affirmative 
action goals can better be met. 

"The univeraity doesn't have a good track record 
on enrolling stuclenta from underrepresented minority 

. groups," said Assemblyman Peter Chacon, D-San 
Diego, who initiated the action. 

The campus committee will be composed of 
predominantly Black, Chicano and female faculty 
members, studenta and administrators. Their 
purpose is to 8IIeIS existing affirmative action 
programs and related services on both the graduate 
and undergraduate levels, set out numerical goa1a 
and time tables, and make their recommendations in 
an interim report to the legislature by November, 
1980. 

The graduate .tuclent affirmative action plan, 
proposed to the aubcornmittee by Dr. Alice Cox, 
asaistant vice president of academiC aftain, conaited 
of 19 programs desi8ned to build up the eIisibiJity 
pool and expand student support service project. 

The program was not suppoaed l»y the 
Commission on POIt·Secondary Education (CPSE), 
which i. the legialature's advisory board on matters 
involving higher education. 

Representatives from these ,campus committees 
will also serve on a state· wide committee. 

UC Student Regent Hector Lozano told the 
committee that since 1975, there has been an 
average increase of five Chicano studenta per year 
per campus. 

The Assembly subcommittee also decided to 
allocate only $150,000 of the $600,000 UC 
requested for the establishment of the graduate 
affirmative action programs. 

CPSE budget analyst William Pickens told the 
legislators that the Rraduate .tudent affirmative 
actioo propoaal was not as carefully planned as the 

j)8I1nership and partners programs the university hu 
~tablished to prepare and recruit minorities from 
Junior and senior high achooIa. 

"What use is there in establishing programs and 
changes when actual enroUment continued to show 
the severe under representation of Chicanos in the 

The subcommittee also temporarily suspended 
any decision on the university's request that the .tate 
totally support the un~graduate .tuclent affirmative 

Marijuana Studied 
Despite 'Difficulty 

BY MONICA GIEBEN 
!taft Writer 

In light of the current 
attempt to legalize marijuana 
by referendum in California, 
many advocates and 
opponenta 01 the drug are 
looking to the scientific 
communaty for "all the 
anewers." 

And for at least one UCSD 
researcher currently involved 
in psychological studies in the 
effecta of marijuana on the 
human body, the lack of 
previous research and the 
endless red tape that 
surrounds government 
approval of such experimenta' 
tion is frustrating. 

Tony Deutach, a professor 
of psychology at UCSD, has 
had some experience with the 

- study of marijuana and he 
says "one of the problems with 
marijuana is that the amount 
of research that has been done 
on it is pitiable. The amount of 
evidence we have on it is very, 
very poor. (' 

According to Deutsch, one 
difficulty aaaociated with the 
study of marijuana i. defining 

what exactly is "harmful/' 
"The fact is that if you take itm 
low enough doses, or doses 
that are well enough spaced, 
no drug it harmful. On the 
other hand, that is not to say 
that people ought to take any 
druf that comes .....

c1>mpletely harmless is 
exceedingly naive. Every drut 
has side , eHecta. Ther!! are 
obviously certain harmful 
effects associated with 
inhaling a v~etable matter." 

"Secondly, , says Deutsch, 
"we don't have very much 
experience with the drug." He 
explains that in many

Iranians Downplay 
Carter's .Sanctions I • 

Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini urged Iranians to 
rejoice in their final break with 
the "world.devouring 
plunderer" America. and the 
Tehran government began 
mobilmng the people for a 
"holy war" of belt.tightening 
and possible rationing to 
grapple with economic woes. 

President Abo/hassan Bani· 
Sadr declared there was "no 
reason to worry" about the US 
economic embargo against 
Iran, but added that Iranians 
would need an extra effort to 
resist the pressure. 

In a message to the nation, 
Khomeini said President 
Carter's anti·lran actions 
would have no effect on the 
status of the 50 US Embassy 
hostages, in their 157th day of 
captivity in the hands of young 
Moslem students. 

He said a decision on their 
fate still must await convening 
of the new Iranian Parliament, 
which may be months away. 

When Carter anoO\Joced 
the break in US.-lranian 
diplomatic relationa and the 
virtual trade ban Monday, he 
said "other actions" might be 
taken if the hostage. were not 
released "promptly." 

US officials were not ruling 
out a naval blockade of 
Iranian ports or other military 
action. 

The Carter administration 
also sent strong signals to US 
aUies yesterday that it expecta 
some help in the economic 
offensive, but there were no 
sign. of immediate coopera· 
tion. 

The US sanctions are not 
expected to have a major 
impact on the Iranian 
economy, since trade between 
the two countries had already 
dwindled to negligible levels 
since the embassy takeover 
Nov. 4. 

Khomeini told Iranians that 
Carter's break in relations was 
a "good omen" because it

Student Rec Facilities 
Referendum 

In April, 1980. undergraduate and 
gradua'tesrucknta at UCSD will beaskedto'~ 
. vote on a Student referendum to constnact, 

maint~,." and .operate new' student recreati~ faCilities. " ~. ' ., 
The; question will appear on the haBot as 

follows: . 
"Shall the Students of the University of 

California at San Diego assess themselves a 
fee of $6.50 per quarter per student for a 
period of up to 25 years for the sole 
purpose of constructing, maintaining, and 
operating Student Recreation Facilities 
consisting of a swimming pool, jacuzzi, five 
racquetball/handball courts, and a 
shower/locker room located just north of 
the Warren West Field, a jacuzzi at the 
Natatorium, and night lighting on the Muir 
Field, said Facilities to be governed bv the 
Student Recreation Facilities Charter?" 

It is estimated that the proposed facilities 
will cost $1-,219,000 and will be paid for 
with an 11.5% Regents Loan. Based on an 
enrollment of 10,000 students, the $6.50 
fee will generate $195.000 annually, of 
which $15~OOO will cover the payback of 
the loan, leaving ~5,000 for annual 
mllintenance and utility costs. 

The loan will be fully paid in 25 years; at 
the end of the 25-vear payback period, 
there will be a direct all, student, vote to 
approve a new fee level for continqeci 

. maintenance and operation. 
This referendum question has been 

initiated, planned, and proposed by 
students working for student interests, 
with full professional and technical 
support. 

* The Quarterlv assessment will not begin 
until completion of construction! occu-
pancy of these facilities. Students will pay 
for the facilities available for use. 

_ The construction will be completed with 
no trees eliminated. Solar hearing and 
natural ventilation will reduce maintenance . 
costs and external energy dependence. 

Students on financial aids will not be 
personallv a.ssesaed this fee inasmuch _ the 
financial aids package include-. all required 
fees: 

There will be no additional user fees to 
registered students.

Film/D,B. John 

Hunter ' ThoDlpson's Inner Wars Fail in FilDl 
After enduring a collection 

of cliches punctuated by some 
nice dancing (All That Jau), 
we had hopes that Where the 
Buffalo Roam, touted .. a 
"Major Studio Sneak Prevue," 
would provide some measure 
of amusement. Starring Bill 
Murray and Peter Boyle, with 
music by Neil Young, based 
on "the twisted legend 01 Dr. 
Hunter S. Thompson," it 
seemed to promise at least a 
few laughs, maybe 90 minutes 
of harmless escapism. Not so, 
sad to say. Even the boisterous 
guffaws of the truest believers 
faded to near·silence as the 
debacle wore on. 

Neil Young's music 
disappears alter the 
introductory theme, sung 
plaintively, Ii cappella, over 
the titles. The film goes 
downhill from there, opening 
with Murray as Thompson in 
his den, surrounded by the 
expected props-Wild Turkey 
bottles, beer, pills, guns, a 
Nixon dummy with a joint in ita 
mouth, a doberman that 
attacks the dummy on 
command, etc. 

. goodness are represented by 
drug-using hippies of the 60s, 
oppo.ed by the tyrannical 
Establishment. Brutal 
sentences for m~rijuana 

to the truth of this conOid, 
although he resists being 
drawn into the revolutionary 
camp. He spends his time 
covering presidential 

confronts Nixon in a restroom 
as the President attempts to 
Pall water. Thompson recites 
an impassioned critique of 
American political life, 
characterizing it as a 
predetermined struggle 
between the "doomed" and the 
ripoffs. Nixon listens 
incredulously, and then 
proclaims, "Fuck the 
doomed." 

The drug motif central to 
the film doesn't pack a lot of 
clout or relevance these days. 
Within such a framework the 
issues the Ii 1m does try to bring 
up seem passe. Perhaps the 
makers sought to capitalize on 
the nostalgia of the generation 
of 1968, or perhaps they 
wished, br invoking the 
barbarity 0 the drug laws of 
the fairly recent put, to 
provide today's youth with 
lOme sense of the price their 
predecessors paid to secure 
the relatively liberal climate of 
the present. Unfortunately, the 
film wanders aimleuly, 
plotleasly, from one caricature 
to another. Outraged at heavy 
t!Ullentencel given his clienta, 
Boyle goes berserk in the 
courtroom, joins a guerilla 
band, deal. weapon. with a 
crazed, red-haired Mexican 
revolutionary who flips at the 
feel 01 a machine gun and fires 
it randomly at his own 
comrades. 

Hunter Thompson's elforts 
to paint the journalist as 
adventurer, to portray his 
inner consciousness as a 
battleground, was an 

Murray proceeds to plod 
through one predictable, 
unamusing scene after another 
in a pair of Converse AlIstars 
that never seem to get dirty 
over a period of several years. 
His elforls to project an image 
of a totally stoned, outrageous 
journalistic outlaw consist 
mostly of a monotonic 
mumbling of gonzo platitudes, 
many of them inaudible. 
When he does make himself 
perfedly- dhr, ~ i. not !/«y 
funny or far out. Waving a 
pi.tol at a terrified hitchhiker 
doesn't quite make it, ':lor does 
slipping acid to a reporter from 
the Washington Post-too 
brutal, too obvious, totally 
unsubtle.

• interesting inversion. Bul it 
doesn't work on film, because 
the "action" in Thompson's 
stuff is primarily mental. 
Consequently, he is limited for 
the most part to observing the 
absurdity around /tim. When 
his surroundings are as grossly 
and crudely caricatured as 
they are · in this film, the 
product never gets beyond a

part from its reliance on a

he happened on Georle 
McGovern hovering ov. a 
urinal in a slate of semi-Ibock 
ju,t after George had lOt the 
newa that a .uppo.ed

Thi. film might have 
succeeded if it had been more 
honest about ita hero. If it had 
tried to show him manufactu-
ring hi. incredible copy from 
bewildered, unprogrammed 
observ &lion of a mundane but 
sub.tantial and potent 
environment, rather than 
conjuring up absurd, 
unconvincing fantasies 
punctuated by Murray'. 
mumbling and occalional 
pecks at the typewriter. 

The film does have its 
moments. The satirical 
portrayal of the Jann Wenner-
tike rock magazine publisher i. 
on target. One of filmdom's 
more alluring party dance 
scenes take. place in 
Thompson's Superbowl hotel 
suite, but the problem is that 
one would rather watCh that 
than the resl of the film. And 
it's still a mystery what 
relevance, if any, the title has 
to the project. 

But it will probably be a 
moneymaker, de.pite the 
dismal achievement it 
representa.

La.t .ea.on the mo.t 
.uccesalul of television's The 
Shaketpecrre PIa/l' was the 
fine production of the history 
play, Richard II. Thit season 
the series continues in the 
same vein with a IUperb 
adaptation of the hiatory, 
Hen", IV, Part I. 

Hen", IV is part of what the 
producer. are c:aIJing the 
l-Ienriad, a series of four play. 
(Richard II, Henry IV Parts I 
and II, and Henry V) directed 
by David Giles, with the same 
acton continuing their roles 
over a number of play.. The 
play. have a beautiful 
continuity and reveal what the 
Hria at ita beat can achieve. 

The aeries begins with the 
deposition and murder of King 
Richard, and the rise to power 
of Henry Bolingbroke who 
beconlel King Henry IV. 
Hen", IV Pa,' I begin. with 
Henry being beaeilJeCl by 
usurper •• Henry'. rise to the 
throne has COlt him hi. peace 
of mind and many of his 

friend •. In addition to the civil 
war, which span. both play., 
Hertr}' rmut contend with hi. 
100, Prince Hal. 

The play develops through 
a series of contrastl. Henry 
and FaI.taff, representing 
order and chao. respectively, 
offer Hal a contrasting pair of 
father ligures. Hal is aIao a 
character of contraat: he 
appears to be a wild, 
undiIcipIined youth but i. a 
calculati!ll poIitici~ 

The acting throughout this 
·production is oulltanding. As

endearing rogue who can talk 
hi. way out of almo.t

captures the comic exaggera-

while giving it a melancholy 
edge. 

In the role of Hal, David 
Gwillim gives a superb 
performance. He deftly

captures racter s 
dichotomy and political 
expertile; he is a modern man, 
calculating and even more 
pragmatic than hi, father . 
Some actors find ~ difficult to 
reconcile the roguish Hal with 
the cold Prince - they do not 
know how to make him 
.ympathetic. But Shakespeare 
Uno.t certainly did not want 
Hal to be .ympathetic, and he 
was critical of Hal', 
disposition. Gwillim captures 
this kind of ambivalance in 

~, and presents him as a 
. complex figure. 

A. Hot,pur, Hal'. rival, 
Tun Pigott-Smith (an excellent

Measure (or Measure) is 
impressive and offers an

Henriad.
