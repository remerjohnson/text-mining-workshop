UCSD student 
killed in shooting 

Greg ToshlO Nakatani , a 23 
year old UCSD srudent , was shot 
and killed eptember 21 dunng a 
confrontation with two men m 
the parkmg lot at Alfonso's Taco 
Shop m Leucadia 

akatani and a friend were 
eating in the restaurant's patio 
around 1:30 Sunday morning, 
when a car with two men pulled 
mto the parking space next to 
Nakatani's car. A verbal 
altercation broke out when one 
of the men stru k akatani's car 
with the car door. 

The two men then went into 
the restaurant and ordered food . 
When they came OUt, more 
words were exchanged. One of 
the men then produced a gun 
and shot Nakatani in the chest. 

After the shoOting, the twO 
men fled the scene. Nakatam 
was taken to Scripps Hospital m 
Encinitas where he was 
pronounced dead on arrival. 

Last Wednesday night Shenffs 
deputies arrested a man they 
believe to be one of the men 
involved in the shooting. 
I1oephonso Perez Martinez was 
arrested after deputies stopped a 
car which matched the 
description of the car that 
witnesses gave on the night 

akatani died . 

UCSD professor 
awarded Fields Medal 

Michael H. Freedman, Charles 
Lee Powell Professor of 
Mathematics at UCSD, has been 
named a winner of the Fields 
Medal, the most prestigious 
award in mathematics. 

The medal is given every four 
years to promising young

mathematicians and IS 
considered the mathematiCS 
eqUivalent of the Noble Prize. 

It was presented to Freedman 
and two others of the 
Intemattonal Congress of 
Mathematicians ClCM) in 
Berkeley 

The Other wmners of the 
Fields Medal were Imon 
Donaldson of Oxford Ul11verslt)' 
and Gerd Faltlngs of Pnnceton 

The Medal IS presented to 
young mathematiCians 111 
recognition of progesslve 
achievements in the field of 
mathematics. According to an 
ICM announcement, Freedman 
won his medal for his -amazing 
results in the field of topology." 

Freedman's major research 
interest is in topology, a branch 
of mathematics that involves the 
study of shapes, imd is currently 
centered on the global structure 
of four-dime nsional spaces. 

His work could eventually 
affect our understandmg of the 
umverse smce most models of 
the universe are based on four 
dimensional manifolds. 

The Medal is named in honor 
of j.c. Fields, who proposed the 
idea of the award when he was 
president of the ICM when the 
organization met in Toronto in 
1924. The idea was accepted in 
1932 and the first medals 
awarded in 1936.

UC Labs Test For Drugs 
By BRIAN HILL 
UC Wire U C control over Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos national 

laboratori es could be weakened 
by a drug testing plan for 
workers at Depanmem of Energy 
facilities that is bei ng developed 
by federal officials. 

The plan's effects will depend 
on whether the planners define 
the program as aimed at 
"national security" or "personnel 
management. " 

The Livermore and Los Alamos 
laboratories, where nuclear 
weapons are designed, are 
managed by the university for 
the Depanment of Energy. 

The drug testing plan will be 
aimed at employees in "sensitive" 
pOSitions, such as those who 
handle classified documents or 
nuclear materiaL 

Livermore Personnel Director 
Helga Christopherson said the 
university has a number of 
questions about what "perceived 
problem" DOE's proposed 
Human Reliability Program is 
"shooting at." 

A systemwide administrator 
who requested anonymity said it 
is unclear if the program's 
objective is to protect national 
security or if it is directed at 
personnel management, which is 
contractually under university 
control. 

The program's objective will 
probably determine whether the 
university. or DOE will maintain 
the program files , which agency 

"IX 
STEEL 
WITH SPECIAL GUEST 

SUNRA 

will be able to decertify or to fire 
employees and to whom 
employees will address their 
appeals. 

Los Alamos Personnel Director 
Do nald K Winston said the 
program is aimed at protecting 
national security. 

The program is intended to be 
a response to "the insider 
threat," Discher said. 

"You have people and they're 
suseeptible to influence by 
outsiders to do bad things 
against national security ," be 
said. 

Fie said the program is aimed 
at "individuals whs,>Se patriotism 
and loyalty to the government 
can be compromised ." 

"The question is, "How can 
these individuals be identified 
and the problem be identified 
and the problem thereby 
mitigated?" he said. 
Broad Program 

The May 24 draft of the HRP 
proposal calls for mandatory 
security clearances; medical 
examinations, including se lf-
reporting; drug testing; 
psyc hiatric assessment; 
supervisors recognizing and 
reporting behavioral change 
and/ or aberrant behavior; alcohol 
screening and medical testing. 

According to Christopherson, 
there have been concerns with 
what the medical basis of the 
program would be; whether the 
testing would be accurate; the 

risk of ge~ing a false positive 
result; the possibility of a 
prescri ption med ication 
triggering a pOSitive result and 
Whether the system would catch 

- the "real problems." 
The anonymous official said 

the program would be a "se rious 
invasion o f personal privacy." 

University and laboratory 
offi cials said DOE is currently 
reworking the plan based on 
input from the university and the 
labs. 

"Initially, (DOE) pushed hard 
for it," 'said Virginia George, of 
the UC General Counsel's Office . 
"Then after folks had an 
opportunity to take a look and 
squawk and raise objections and 
questions as to how it might 
work, DOE said 'Yes, we might 
have to rework it.' " 
Who will control the files? 

ChristOpherson said the 
system will "have to be careful 
abom access to records." 

"When I discussed it with UC 
people before, I wanted them to 
make it clear that ( the files) were 
UC records safeguarded by UC," 
she said. 

The laboratory wants the 
records to be personnel medical 
files under its control,according 
to Christopherson. 

The anonymous official said 
"personnel records belong to UC 
but the proposal implied they 
don't."

UCSD approves 
On-campus housing 
By ANTIGONE GANAKIS, News Editor 

U CSD has moved a significant step closer to alleviating a shortage of 
on-campus housing that has 
grown more severe each year as 
enrollment has increased. 

On September 18, the UC 
Regents grounds committee gave 
unanimous approval to the 
design of an apartment complex 
and a residence hall whic h 
together will accommodate more 
than 1,000 students when 
completed in the fall of 1988. 

More than $31 million worth 
of gradute and undergraduate 
dorms will be constructed to 
house 600 Warren College 
students and 408 Third College 
studems. 

The Warren College Matthews 
Area apanmems will be a $17.2 
'million , three-story structure 
consisting of 154 apartments. 

The Third College hail would 
cost $14.4 million , and include 
15 twO- and four-story buildings 

clustered around a center mall. 
UCSD currendy houses 4,700 

graduate and undergraduate 
students on-campus, almost 30 
percent of the 16,000 student 
enrollment. It is second in 
housing only to UC Santa Cruz 
in the nine-campus university 
system, according to Larry 
Barrett, director of housing and 
food service administration on 
campus. 

For the 1986-87 school year, 
about 1,000 students wanted to 
live on campus, but they had to 
be turned away, Barrett said. 

In separa te actions, the 
Regents also approved 
architecrural and design plans 
for the new multi-purpose tower 
at the UCSD Medical Center in 
Mission Hills and for the new 
Graduate School of International 
Relations and Pacific Studies,

Divestment's ending phase 
There was always a feeli ng among UC proponents of divestment that 

either our amorphous republican governor, or the sly president of the 
UC system would coopt the dignity of conscience that existed within 
the student movement and call it their own. That is, although we 
believed that it could be possible for men such as Deukmej ian and 
Gardner to forego their preference for investment policies that held no 
basls in ethlcs, or sported any grave concern for their effect on the 
oppressed, we did not believe that the governor himself could dupe the 
ma s media into his pledges of a non-politically motivated change of 
principles. 

President Gardner, who authored la t year's temporaty policy -
which, simply, based UC investment policy on the findings of an 
appointed committee who monitored corporate citizenship by way of 
the outdated and ineffective Sullivan Principles - has yet to view the 
actions of the South African regime as appalling enough to warrant any 
serious form of protest. In fact, it was Gardner who lead the divestment 
opposition yet again this year in thei r struggle to aid the U.S. 
corporations in South Africa who knowingly contribute to the 
treacherous system of apartheid. Since Gardner does not have to face 
the masses during the November elections , h e was able to show his true, 
profiteering colors during thi s past summer's Regents meeting where 
divestment was approved. 

Governor Duke , h owever, was placed in the well-deserved, but 
disadvantageous position of having to defend his South African policy 
in front of well-organized , popular forces. Deukmejian, who was running 
well ahea9 of his democratic opponent Tom Bradley in the polls at the 
time, was advised nor to take the great risk of giving Bradley the moral 
highground on an issue that might determine which way the majori ty of 
our youth an d Third World voters would sway on election day. For 
although it is safe to say that Governor Duke has made substantial 
political inroads with young, middle class white voters, he has yet to 
fully capture thClT Idealistic imagmations. Deukmejian has made little 
progre s in impressing hi Ideas upon lower class African, Latino, and 
Asian Americans Chi admini tration ha Virtually ignored their needs), 
but d uring the past two years he has garnered some Significant support 
from these communities middle and upper classes. It was with these 
small, but Important inroads in mi nd that The Duke entered the 
smokey backrooms 10 Sacramento and hashed out a new investment 
policy with a few other wary Regents. 

What analysis, or argument, or illusoty plan could the governor have 
hatched to conVInce the Rege nts who switched their votes that UC 
divestment was in the best interest of themselves,their companies and 
corporation s, and the future of republican (i.e. multinational 
domination) politiCS itseIP After listening to scores of economists, 
sociologists, historian s, political sc ientists, moralists, bishops, students, 
and oppressed Black South Africans themselvd speak to the Regents for 
two years about the absolute idiosy of continued investment in 
apartheid we have come to this conclusion : that the Deukmejian

Administration, and the UC Regents who fought against divestment for 
the past years caved into political pressure with the bleSSing of most 
corporate leaders. 

The corporate world within the United States does not take 
challenges to their policies in supposedly "safe" foreign countries, such 
as South Africa, lightly. The divestment movement here in the states is 
nearly unprecedented in the breadth of its attack against corporate 
sponsorship of tyrannical regimes. Domestic opposition to corporate 
labor practices at home can claim a few major victories along the way, 
but even union organizers themselves will admit that they have never 
been able to rally the populace around such a cause like divestment 
activists did . U.S. multinational corporations were exhibited as they 
should be; not as pillars of progress in the "decrepit Third World ," but 
as political and economic monopolies that subsist on cheap labor and 
greedy, authoritarian trends in the sponsor country's militaty. 

This exposure of the corporation's true nature by divestment activists 
send shivers through the corporate world , as witnessed by the avalanche 
of companies that ran to sign the Sullivan PrinCiples when state and city 
governments, along with university boards, demanded that they do so. 
The corporations would comply, it was said , as long as wages and a 
major change of government would not be put on their agenda. It is 
quite possible, now that divestment has turned into the law of the 
politician's land, that multinationals will be forced into changing their 
image overseas. Within the realm of the divestment era, corporations 
have entered into potentially the most volatile stage in their history. 
They have been pushed into "blessing" divestment campaigns only as 
the majority of them will pull out of South Africa for a short period 
anyway, and will rerum there with the advent of a new government, 
who may have to welcome their capital , and polished image. 

The corporations only hope in saving their traditional policy of 
plundering without reprimandation is if the Reagan Administration 
succeeds in killing all effective sanctions by coercing Congress into 
upholding the old buffoon's veto . However, many corporate lobbyists 
have been heard to be whi_spering in the President's ear, saying such 
things as "let them have their 'moral' victory, they'll leave us alone once 
South Africa simmers down ." 

The prediction may hold true , for moral movements come and go 
like old actors do in wild west movies. The uproar in South Africa, 
though , will not simmer down , and will mostly likely boil blood for the 
next decade. So it will be up to students, faculty , civil activists, and 
legislators to keep the heat on the corporations all over the Third 
World ; to reignite the national anti -apartheid movement that will back 
the Reagan Administration into imposing full , punitive sanctions against 
the South African regime seems necessary. 

Although many of us are displeased at being a part of a movement 
that earned its first victory by making an international issue a 
gubernatorial imcumbent's political necessity, it was most definitely a 
giant step f9rward. · ~

prison labor worked for cigarette 
money, cleaning the sleeping 
bins , we watched . Meanwhile, a 
young blackberry-colored kid 
flipped over a metal bowl of pink 
Kool-Aid. In his PCP-induced 
madness. he couldn't stand the 
heat of a hundred people 
watching him. The flying bowl 
lazily collided with another 
brother's head. The fight that 
ensued could be colored a 
violent red . The kid defensively 
grabbed a plastic garbage bucket 
full of lunch refuse and used the 
unlikely weapon to threaten his 
approaching antagonist The 

man with the brUIsed head said : 
"Go on ... I wish you would ." 
After the kid swung it , and lost 
it. the other man collared him, 
pulling hIm off balance toward 
the floor, and delivered a slow 
underhanded volleyball serve of a 
punch to his face that exploded 
the room Into rapidly hifting 
olors. 

The blow to the head should 
have rendered him unconscious,

escaped to the corner of the cell .

riches were our poverty. A great 
revolutionary said, "Unite, you 
have nothing to lose but your 
chains." This made us think, and

demonstrates, however, this test 
IS Insufficient protection for the 
First Amendment. That is 
because It comes into play too 
late in the process. The "mahce" 
test guards agamst an easy 
victory In these lawsuits , but it 
does li ttle [0 prevent them from

Yet. it is the mere filing of 
these lawsuits that does so much 
damage. The insta nt the case is

chilled. As the woman quoted in 
California Lawyer demonstrates, 
someone who has been 
punished once for political 
ac tivity will be reluctant to 
become politically active again . 
More important, even people 
who have not been sued but who 
merely learn of these suits will be 
dissuaded from engaging in 
similar political activity for fear 
of incurring the same 
punishment.

One way [0 do that is for 
defense attorneys to seek 
summary resolutions and for

one that may be called for, is [or 
the American legal sys tem to 
abolish defa mation acti ons [or

Public officials have greater 
access to the commun ications

falsehoods made about them

light of the serious threat to the 
Fir t Amendment and the 
democratic process these types 
of suits pose, perhaps public 
officials sho uld be forced to use 
the are na of public debate , rather 
than a counroom, to challenge 
Slatements made against them . 

Americans have always

Defamation sui ts which pumsh

Regents Approve Divestment Plan 
By MAITHEW LAlT, Associate News Editor 

T HE TURMOIL concerning UC investments in South Africa has been resolved 
this summer, putting an end to 
student (rotests , as the UC 
Board 0 Regents approved a 
plan to divest aU of its holdings 
in companies doing business in 
that COUntry. 

The new policy called for 
immediate divestment of II UC 
stocks and bonds holding "in 
any business enterprise or bank 
that increases its operations 
facilities or makes any new 
investments in South Africa ." 

Other companies tied to UC 
investments will be given a one-
year grace period to cease doing 
business in South Africa. After 
the grace time, UC will have 
three years to sell those holdings. 
This policy cuts ofT all financial 
ties with South Africa, according 
to Lilia Villanueva , a 
spokesperson from the Office of 
the president. 

Governor Deukmejian said he 
switched his stance on the issue 
because of the deteriorating 
situation in South Nrica. He 
wrote , "Given the extent of 
viOlence and unrest in South 

and his campaign for re·election 
against Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley. "It's clear that Bradley 
wanted to make this an issue, 
and there 's no doubt that (this 
being an election year) had 

done it sooner." Bradley is 
"pleased" with the policy but he 
·would have gone further by also 
dealing with contracting in South 
Africa ," the spokesperson said . 

"I have to credit the govemor 

Pete Chacon said . 
Members of the Coalition for a 

Free South Nrica said , 
"Deukmejian's move was 
obviously a political ploy." 

"(Deukmejian) clearly didn't 
want to be ourllanked by Bradley 
on an issue that obviously had 
growing suppon." Hahn sai& 
"The fact of the matter is thaJ it 
did have growing support , 
because the students worked 
very hard to give it that. The 
faculty helped give that 
movement added momentum 
and support ." 

The new policy, which passed 
on a 13-9 vote, will be effecti ve 
upon the passage of State 
legislation whic h will cove r all 
costs to individual Regents fro m 
any legal action a rising from the 
adoption of the policy. 

The governor just signed a bill 
which will enable the UC 
Regents to sell the investments in 
South Africa, worth $3.1 million, 

1>' by indemnifying them of any 
personal liability in carrying out 
the policy. 

Members of the Coalition for a 
Free South Nrica. an activist 
group on campus, said , "This 
policy allows for a year grace 
period but while they are waiting 
to divest there a re people dying 
in South Africa." 

UCSD Student Protesters March Against Apartheid This bill will make California one of 19 states which have 
passed legislation designed to 
show opposition to South. Africa's 
racial discrimination. The sudden change in the 

Regents' policy came at the 
urging of Governor George 
Deukmejian, who in the past had 
been against divestment, vetoing 
legislatio n milder than the policy 
he proposed to the Board of 
Regents. 

Africa at the given time , I believe 
we have sufficie nt economic 
justification to question the 
soundness of California's 
investment in any enterprise 
which would embark on new 
investments in the country." 

Deukmejian's switch came in 
the middle of an eleCtion year 

lHE 

something to do with why (the 
proposal) happened now," 
Steven Hahn , a UCSD professor 
of history, said . 

A spokesperson from Mayor 
Bradley's campaign office said 
that Bradley is "glad Deukmejian 
finally exhibited some tag-along 
leadership, and wished he had 

for finally taking a positive 
position on divestment. I do 
believe he was convi nced that 
the situation in South Africa had 
deteriorated to a point where the 
state of California had no other 
choice but to take an action that 
would hurry the demise of 
apartheid along," Assemblype rson

investment portfolio is $9.6

Deukmejian signs 
divestment bill 

do business in South Africa. 
Companies alTected by the law 

criticized Deukmejian's stand 
and said divestiture was unlikely 
to alter their operations in South 
Africa, as state pension fund 
managers prepared to put the 
plan mto motion, 

that makes drugs to fight 
tuberculosis, 

Both Chevron and Dow have 
publicly stated that passage of 
the divestiture law will not cause 
them to change their operations 
in the white-ruled nation. 

Regents to proceed with their 
plan to sell up to '$3,1 billion in 
holdings linked to South Africa 
by indemnifying University 
olTicials from any personal 
liability in carrying out the 
divestiture policy. 

By ANTIGONE GANAKIS, ews Eduor State employee pension funds 
have invested about $176 millIOn 
in Chevron sto ks and bonds. 
The pension funds have also 
Im'ested heavily in Dow 
Chemical Co., buying abut $173 
million worth of stocks and 
bonds in the firm , which 
operates a plant in South Africa 

The four-year divestiture plan 
will requirc the sale of up to $6 
billion in stocks and bonds held 
by thc tatc Public Employees 
Retirement System and $2.9 
billion held by the State Teachers 
Retirement Systems in companies 
such as Dow and Chevron, 
according to recent estimates. 

Assemblywoman Maxine 
Waters and author of the 
measure, said the UC Regents 
actions will be the largest 
divestiture action aimed at South 
Africa anywhere in the world. 

GOVERNOR George Deukmejian si ed the first of its kin~lVestiture 
law last Friday, staling his 
opposition to South Afnca's 
system of apartheid. Deukrnejian 
also called on Congress to 
ovemde President Reagan 's veto 
of legislation imposing sanctions 
on the racially divided nation. 

"We are condemning 
apartheid m the strongest 
possible terms that we can 
within the powers we have in 
this state ," Deukmejian told 
reporters before the signing of 
the law. 

The Republican Governor of 
California, who has sought a

UC Discovery aids search for human cure 

AIDS Vaccine for Monkeys Developed 
U niversiry of California researchers say they have developed an AIDS 
vaccine that has successfully 
protected laboratory monkeys, 
and believe the same techniques 
can be used for a human 
vaccine, 

financial liability. humans ," Marx added, The twO scientists compared 
their research path with that of 
Dr. Jonas Salk, who developed 
the world-renowned Salk polio 
vaccine in 1954, Gardner said 
Salk, who now heads the Salk 
Institute at UCSD, "is himself 

interested in aur work." 

Salk was quoted as calling the 
results of the Davis research "a 
Significant repon (that) lays the 
foundation for future work on 
the same lines." [l:i) 

Dr. PresIOn Marx, a virologist 
and chief of a 13-member 
research team at the university's 
California Primate Research 
Centl'r at Davis, and medical 
pathologist Murray Gardner told 
a conference earlier this month 
they were very ·encouraged by 
their tests on monkeys. 

Marx said the year-long study 
compared six vaccinated 
monkeys with six given no such 
protection . All 12 monkeys had 
been injected with lethal doses 
of the simian acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome (SAl OS) 
vi rus. 

He sard the six monkeys that 
were given the vaccine are all 
still healthy after a year wi th no 
signs of the infection, while four 
of the six that did not receive 
the vaccine developed AIDS, and 
three died . 

However, Marx continued, the 
procedures used for treating 
viruses in monkeys and humans 
"are parallel , although not 
iden tical," whic h means the 
success with the monkeys gives 
strong encouragement to follow 
similar "retrovirus" techniques to 
develop an AIDS vaccine for 
humans. 

"What we found in monkeys 
is an indication (of what could 
work in humans), but not a 
guarantee ," he said, explaining 
that AIDS in monkeys is similar 
to, but not identical to, AIDS in 
humans. In both cases, victims 
usually die of infections, 

Student housing 

But they cautioned that it 
would probably be twO to four 
more years before their research 
would produce a vaccine that 
could be used on humans, and 
that even then it might not be 
practical for wide use because of 
cost, high potential risk and 

"It worked even better than we 
thought it would ., . it looks like 
AIDS is a controllable disease by 
vaccine," Marx said . "But don't 
mistake what we have 
accomplished . This vaccine will 
not work with humans. It is not 
expected to work with humans.

Xerox, GM, 3M and Dupont. 

Some Companies, such as 
Coca Cola , arc now making 
plans to sell their assers in South 
Africa, UC holds stock in Coca 
Cola. 

The UC Treasurers estimated 
that the divestment will cost the 
University $118 mi llion in 
trading costs, which will occur 
because of ihe neceSSity to trade 

in smalle r, more volatile 
companies. 

This policy puts an end to the 
many student protests which 
have been common occurrences 
on UC campuses. The last rwo 
years have seen the most 
ogranized student part icipation, 
with rallies, sit-i ns, mock 
shanties, class boycotts, and 
similar exp ressions of 
oppOSition. which often resulted 
in physical confrontations wi th 
police. 

The coalition for a Free South 
Africa said that their 
organization will now take on a 
new focus "concentrating on 

educating people and providing 
information on the condition in 
South Africa. We are still going 
to be seen on campus, we wi ll be 
visible." 

"It ·s hard to imagine this (type 
01) outcome were it not for the 
work of the students and the 
faculty who helped dramatize the 
issue to the Administration ," 
Hahn said . 

Although most politicians, 
students and faculty members are 
pleased with the poilcy, "The 
coalition thinks it's only a partial 
victory. Divestment is only one 
part of an overall strategy to end 
apartheid. The most complete 

thing we could ask for would be 
total sanctions o f South Africa. 
Nothing short of a toral embargo

policy, Deukmejian said that he 
doesn't believe that the federal 
government can dictate what 
divestment policies governors 
can adopt on the state level. 

The federal legislation , which 
passed both houses of Congress, 
would place a ban on new 
investments and loans to South 
Africa, block exports of crude oil 
and petroleum products, and halt 
imports of South African 
uranium, coal, textiles, arms, steel 
and fann/roducrs . The measure 
also woul prohibit 'South African 
aircraft from obtaining landing 
rights in the United States. But, 
according to legislators, this still 
stops short of requiring full 
divestiture. 

Corporations that woud be 
affected by California's 
divestment law debated that

only harm, not help, the black "I think we all ought to ask

Sanctions vetoed 
Continued from page 10 

With this ve to, Reagan stands 
to face the strongest legislative 
opposition of his career. In his 
six years , Congress has only 
overridden five of 49 presidential 
vetos. None of the vetas, 
however, have been of the 
magnitude of the South African 
sanctions bill . 

The bill passed both houses of 
Congress by more than two-
thirds majorities. The democratic 
controlled House is expected to 

override the veto by a large 
margin. Therefore, the White . 
House lobbyists will concentrate 
on the GOP dominated Senate , 
which passed the bill 84-14. 

President Reagan argued that 
these types of sanctions would 
only hun the black workers and 
said that he would much rather 
work with members of both 
parties in Congress to develop a 
compromise which will put an 
end to apartheid in a more 
suitable manner. ~

THE NINETIES: DECADE OF DECADENCE 
Lee A TIh 4:00 - 5:20 BB 2135 cc: 2568 
Instructor: Bram Dijkstra 
The 1890's were a decade in which novelists, poets and painters, all over Europe, were 
fascinated by the symbolic potential of images of evil. It was a decade of economic crises 
and widespread industrial and imperialist expansion. The average person seemed 
subjected to the whims of mysterious, asocial forces beyond the control of simple 
humanity. In English popular and "high" literature alike, these tensions came to be 
expressed in a proliferation of threatening goddesses, vampires, hypnotists. Martians, 
and other imaginative representations of the late Victorians' fears and suspicions about 
the capacity of civilization to control what they considered to be the evil core of our 
animal nature. Scapegoats had to be found. and hence it was a period of the most 
unabashed racism and sexism. This course will explore the social significance of these 
developments through a reading of some of the most famous works of British literature 
and popular fiction of the period. We shall also try to account for the renewed current 
popularity of many of the~ works. 
Texts: The Pictureo! Dorian Gra" (1891). Trilb" (1893) , jude the Obscure ( 189S). Salome, 
War o! the Worlds (1898). Dracula (1897). Heart of Darkness (1899).

Lee A TIh 11:30 · '12:50 APM 2301 ·cc: 2560 
Instructor: Lori Chambe'rlain 
For the "abcdeminded." this will be a course in the major works of James Joyce, one of 
the most significant and influential of modern writers. We will begin with selections 
from Dubliners , move on to A Partraitof the Artist, and will spend a substantial amount of 
the quarter de-ciphering Ulysses, a work best read, I think. as a collaborative project. The 
course will address Joyce's biography, some of the major criticism, and his relation to 
modernism. Time and interest permitting, we will try our eyes at reading a short section 
from Finnegans Wake at the end of the quarter.

The in's and out's of fraternity living 
By TROY CARDENAS 

D ON looked at the fancy lenering on the walls and it was JUSt as weI}, that it 
was written in Greek. He 
couldn't make heads or tails out 
of it, and after seeing a river of 
Polo shirts burst out of one of 
the doors singing "Why I Want 

would obviously take 10 coax one 
OntO the table - especially when 
their vocabularies consisted 
mainly of half-drunken giggles 
and the words "totally" and "such 

od l" ag . 
"Hi , Don . My name's Jeff -

Jeff Cooper," Jeff greeted him as 

beamed, "I'm the house president 
so I get a single. When you're a 
pledge , you're assigned a room 
with your OIher pledge brothers." 
Don nodded his approval. The 
room was posh and expansive. 
Jeff had spent a lot of time and 
money on it, and it showed. But 

girlfriends. The room was dark 
and smelled like 10 pairs of 
sweaty feet after a triathlon . 

After seeing Don stare at the 
pledge porch around him , Jeff 
finally asked the inevi table 
question: 'What's your major, 
Don?" Don had heard that line 

funny about majoring in 
English . 

~&A~K~~Nu; he~~ r~~~------~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~--~--l 'sure he wanted to know what it . 
meant, either. It wasn 't Don's lack 
of housing that forced him into 
this awkward situation , and as 
the fraternity across the street 
starred a retaliatory chant, he 
began to think that life on a park 
bench might not be so bad after 
all . 

"I'll give you a little 
upperclassman advice, Don. You 
see, as a Business major I can tell 
you that English isn't practical. 
Let's face it, you're not going to 
make any money off it." Jeff's 
eyes traveled over every piece of 
clothing on Don's body and 
finally came to rest on Don's 
shoes. "Those are Italian, aren't 
theyr he asked. 

-o-~--
As Don walked slowly down 

Fraternity Row, a house with a 
formidable facade caught his eye , 
After having seen so many of the 
clone-like exteriors that 
decorated the other houses on 
the Row, Don actually looked 
forward to trying this one out. 
Maybe it would be different. 

Once inside, Don nodded 
approvingly at the huge living 
room and dining area. 
Everything was immaculate, 
although one comer smelled 
suspiciously of beer and urine 
masked by toO much "Love My 
Carpet." 

"And this , everybody, is the 
recreation area," trumpeted the 
well-dressed house rush 
chairman. ·We have a standing 
bet around here that the fi rst guy 
to get a Delta Phi on the billiard 
table will get a keg of Heineken ." 
Everyone laughed except Don . 
After seeing most of the sorority 
girls with their heavily made-up 
faces, pearl necklaces and tight 
jeans stretching to span the 
Calvin Klein divide , Don 
wondered whether it would be 
wonh spending all of the time it 

.J3 
n. 

he adjusted Don's nametag. ' Say' 
Don , have you had a lOur of the 
house yet?" Don had not and 
found himself skipping every 
other stair 10 the second fl oor 
and walking im o a nicely 
decorated room.

Don was completely unprepared 
when Jeff showed him where the 
pledges lived. Although Jeff said 
it promoted brotherliness, Don 
thought the 20' by 40' square 
room with three bunks crammed 
in the middle could only 
promote no privacy and few

many times. "I'm undeclared 
right now," he replied , not 
knowing what else to say, "but 
I'm thining of majoring In 
English ." Don was surprised by 
Jefrs sudden laughter. Obviously 
he had made a joke, but he 
didn't understand It; what was so 

" ure they are ," Don said. 
"How do you know so much 
about cloth i ng?" 

"Let's be serious for a moment , 
Dan," Jeff replied in a well -
rehea"l"sed lOne. "I don't like 10 
brag, but Pi Nu Phi is the best 
house in the Greek system. We 
don't let just anybody in. Most of 
us are from Morrynda, and it's a 
very well-IO-do area. But I'm sure 
you already know that," Jeff 
smiled knowingly. 

"No, I'm sorry Jeff. I've never 
heard of Morryt:lda. Where is it?" 
Being from the East Coast, Don 
still hadn't figured out West 
Coast names. 

"You don 't know where 
Morrynda is?" Jeff gasped. Don 
thought he looked a little 
flustered, but he had seen the 
look on several other fraterni ty 
members. Don had learned that 
the qUickest way 10 confuse a 
Greek was to ask a question . 

''I'm from the East Coast, Jeff. I 
don't know my way around 
California yet." 

"Jeff thought for a moment, 
then put his arm around Don's 
shoulder. "You know, my father 
is a big-time lawyer, and I've 
been to the city several times 
before . Whereabouts do you live,

"Our files are incomplete" 
By ROBERT LEONE, Staff Writer 

"WhcllCl'cr we 'rc Ie)t In the lurch, 
It's Mcllyl WllO helps with a sCQ/r h, 
Be it C<l;'lS medieval, 
Or Tectonic Upheava l, 
Or Diseases a.Dccling the birch," 

(From a Mdvyl tmn inal 
at UC Berlleley) 

M elvyl, named after Melvil Dewey, the great librarian, is the UC's 
on-li ne book catalog. It is the 
sort of electronic device that 
demonstrates all the promise and 
potential of well-designed 
co mputer ware. Mclvyl is a useful 
lOY that can e nthrall and 
fasci nate people for hours. It is 
incredibly useful, incredibly 
powerful , and responsive to the 
user's research needs, Despite its 
assistive abilities, some people 
love it, and lots of people don't. 

The reasons for liking it arc 
obvious: With a few tapS on the 
keyboard, a knowledgeable user 
can elicit an imense bibliography 
on any number of subjects. It is 
faster than searching through 
two or three diITerent card 
catalogs and it allows one to find, 
books and magazine articles 
stored at other UC campuses. 

Perhaps the reason for 
disliking Melvyl is because it is 
an incomplete catalog, Melvyl 
docs not sto re information on all 
of UCSD's books in its memory. 
The computer has cataloged only 
42 percent of Central's books, 28 
percent of the Biomedical 
Library's books and a mere 22 
percent of the curious volumes at 
Scripps Institute o f Oceanogrphy 
(510) Statisti cs show that Melvyl 
has recorded 394,545 of 

Ce ntral's books, 48 ,378 of the 
books at the Biomedical Library, 
and 43,5 13 of the books at the 
510; for a total of 469,941 
volumes. 

The Melvyl catalog itself states 
that most UCSD library books 
purchased after 1976 arc listed . 
But, if the book you're looking 
for was purchased earlier, it 
might not be entered into the 
catalog, a fatc which might also 
befall newer books. 

In the "command modc" 
fo rmat, the average Melvyl searc h 
turns up lOS books. Howcve r, 
the com pute r shows that 34 
percent of these searc hes don 't 
fi nd any books at a ll . The 
command mode is usually used 
by expe rie nced Melvyl operators , 
who often have considerable 

P lease tum (Q page 26 

Some Melvyl users find it a resourceful alternative to the card catalog.

A Broad Education ~ $3 Spaghetti Dinner ~ I SPECIAL i By JOHN STESKAL 
I T WAS STRANGE to thi nk that ten hours earlier I had flown out of London , that 
bustling city of red double-
decker buses, pubs, bobbies and 
big black taxis, while in the air I 
had peered down at the 
checkered green and yellow 
fields, the winding rivers and of 
course, the rai n clouds. 

Everything is green and wet; or 
rather, everything is waterlogged, 

Now I was on the other side 
of the wo rld, flying into almost 
the exact opposite environ ment 
- a brown and dry landscape; 
suburbia just kind of stretched 
oIT imo an orange and hazy 
smog. Ah, Los Angeles! 

A lot of emotions were 

running through my mind as we 
approached Los Angeles. I was 
ecstatic to be going home to see 
my friends , family and familiar 
sites. A year is a long time to be 
away from loved ones. Yet, I also 
felt very sad; I was leaving a lot 
behind that I had come to love. 

It would be a long time before

knowledge on how to narrow 
down the field when they use 
Mclvyl. so the frustrations of 
often getting no results and even 
more often belllg deluged by 
hundreds, if not thouseands, of 
records is omewhat mitigated . 

However, the easier to use 
"lookup mode," recommended 
for novice Melvyl use rs and 
averaging 124 records retrieved 
after each search has a 47 
percent "zero result"rate. 

Novice users of the system , in 
other words are more likely to 
experience frustrations of not 
getting any listlllgs or of getling a 
horde of confusing, often 
repeating records. In the lookup 
mode, one is less able to winnow 
Melvyl search results for the 
desired books. To search for the 
righ t book, in this mode, the user 
has to wade th rough hundreds of 
books; sometimes this even 
makes the card catalogs look 
good . 

The UCSD student is caught 
between the twi n ills of 
incomplete Melvyl records in 
some cases and an abundance of 
Mclvyl records in others. Like the 
ancient Mediterranean mariners 
of myth who would get trapped 
between Scylla and Charolebdis, 
the UC D student has no choice 
but to ride it out, or use the card 
atalog. IiJ

Education 
ontinued from page 25 

I saw my English, Swedish , 
French and German fnend s 
again. It would be a long time 
before I took a walk on an 
English footpath . England is the 
perfect COUntry for walkers . 

Those walks, whether in the 
countryside , along the South 
Downs Way in Sussex or along 
the coast of Cornwall in the 
mountains of the Lake District 
were fantastic . They really pulled 
me through some tough times. 
And just when the clouds let 

loose their rain, there always 
seemed to be a pub just around 
the corner. And whether I had 
headed ofT on a walk with the 
intention of resolving some 
Internal dilemma or just to 
absorb the sights, sounds and 
smells of the land, I always came 
back refreshed - physically, 
mentally, emotionally. 

What have I gotten out of this 
year in England? My mind 
started racing. sort of scanning 
the year in fast forward . I 
reminisced about people , places, 
sensations and the good and bad 
times, durin~ which I had grown . 

Although humanity shares so 
much in common, each culture 
is different. Academically, 

politically and oClally, I learned 
a lot about the English and other 
Europeans while I was abroad . 
But to me, the most important 
and often the most surpnsing 
things I learned during the year 
co ncerned myself. I looked out at 
the world from a new angle , in a 
new Itght. but I also looked 
internally with a new perspective 
I never had before . It seemed I 
was constantly evaluating and 
then reevaluating the world and 
myself. 

Yes, those walks in the 
countryside had helped me learn 
a lot. And better yet, I knew it 
was only really the beginning; I 
will always be learning new 
things about the world and 
myself. [l

This course will attempt to construct an historical understanding of the first 
centuries of the franciscan order by examining the ways In which individual 
men and women strove to enact religious Ideals In particular contexts. It will 
begin with the novelty of st. francis'lnterpretation of the Christian tradition 
and the challenge which he and his followers posed to existing ecclesiastical 
Institutions. We will then explore the gradual Institutionalization of the 
franciscan order. conflicts within the order as the friars debated how best to 
live up to the standards set bySt. fiancis. relations between this religious elite 
and the masses of believers. and the impact ofthe friars on popular devotion. 
Close attentiop will be paid to the shifting image of francis and the mutiple

Pavillion , she put an ice pack on 
her left knee, Her face and 
uniform were doused in sweat, 
the color of her skin was red 
with fatigue .

that happens." said Jorgensen 
after her team, Chapman College, 
blew a commanding 12-5 lead in 
the third game of thClr semifinal 
match against UCSD at the La 
Jolla Invitational held over the 
weekend at Triton Pavillion . "I 
knew that UCSD was the number 
one team in the nation in 
Division III and now I know 
why, They're really good and I 
think they can beat Nonhridge." 

Jorgensen's forecasting may

"S he was very impressive in 

the match ," said Ker. "but when I 
heard she was only a freshman , I 
just went 'Wow!'" 

Dannivik saw the potential 
right off the bat. "She's a 
diamond in the rough," said 
Dannevik. "A lot of the people 
who recruited her didn't think 
she'd get to play much . they 
thought she was too slow, but I 
thought she could play for'us 
right away. They're alot of people 
who recruited her who know 
they made a mistake ." 

But the person who seems to 
have captured the hearts of 
UCSD partisans is Shannon 
Quigley. Quigley has a larger 
than average build for an athlete; 
6' and 2" 5 pounds. But she also 
is an exciti ng athlete and does 
something that very few women 
volleyball players in the nation 
attempts: a jump serve. Instead 
of noat ing the ball over the net, 
as most players do, Quigley takes 
a few steps back, throws the ball 
high in the air, and tries to spike 
the ball over the net. Her ability 
to do th is has had a tremendous 
affect on the team. 

"She's got a uniqueness that 
no one's got," said Dannevik. 
"She'll be a crowd favorite 
because of her size and her 
serve."

Continued from page 36 
Never was her' serve more 

important than in UCSD'S 
incredible comeback against 
Chapman, where she served four 
aces in the second game. 

"Shannon was a pivotal against 
Chapman and it may be a 
turning point for her," said 
Dannivik. · When she came Into 
the match, It picked everybody 
up. Eve rybody that saw her 

Diana Klint worth 

earlier In {he day said 'Oh my 
God-this is exci ting, here she 
comes.' It hvened up the gym 
and got everybody pumped." 

But the glue of the team is 
setter Kim Stonecipher. 
StoneCipher, selected to the All 
Tournament team. was also {he 
Most Valuable Player a t the 
Elmhurst Tourname nt , held at 
Elmhurst , illinois earlier {his 
season. 

"As far as UCSD is concerned , 
Kim Stonecipher is the one who 
impressed me the most," said 
Elmhurst head coach Jaye Aood . 
he had a hell of a tournament 

out here and we expect them to 
be In the Final Four." 

UCSD is currently 20-3, and 
plays Occidenta l Wednesday 
night at Triton Pavillion. 
Dannevik con edes that 
Occidental is not a very trang 
team and he may give a few of 
his players a night off. ·1 don 't

QUESTION #1. 

WHAT IS THE RIGHT CHOla 
FOR MOST COLLEGE STUDENTS? 

C I986AT&T 

a) AT&T-for everyday discounts of 400/0 to over 
50% off weekday rates on out-of-slate calls. 

b) Short bursts of intense study followed by 
hours of flantic partying. 

c) AT&T -for exceptional value and high quality 
• servICe. 

d) AT&T -for collect, third-party and operator-
assisted long distance calls. 

e) Any class thai does not conflid with "The Love 
Connecliotl~' 

If you picked A, C and D, you're destined for great things. 
Like An'tr Long Distance Service. AT&r offers so many terrific 
values. Like a 40% to over 50% discount off our day rate on night, 
evening, and weekend out-of-state calls. 

Imagine what you'll do with the money you could save. 
Imagine what your parents would do if they found out. 

Of course, you can count on AT&r for clear long distance 
connections any place you call. And AT&r gives you 
immediate credit for wrong numbers. 

To find out more about why you 
should choose A'IIll: give us a call. 
And if you picked Band E, call any-
way. You could probably use someone 
to talk to.

PROPOSITION 61: 
Another Reactionary Measure by Paul Gann 

Citing a few "excesses" in govemment spending. Paul Gann otTers an apparenr 
solution to controlling the cost of govemment by limiting the salaries and benefits 
of state employees. Ironically. he has entided the proposition the "Fair Pay 
Initiative." 
Highlights: ~ 
• The Govemor's salary would increase from $49.100 lO $80,000 per year. 
• The salaries of at least 5,000 state, ciry, county, and special district employees, 
elected, appOinted or employed under contract, would decrease from whatever 
their current salaries are to no more than 80% of the Govemor's salary, or $64,000. 
(This includes the California State higher educational system employees. for 
example, the President, the Chancellor, and prominent professors.) 
• Prohibition of vacation and sick leave for all Slate employees. 
NEGATIVE IMPACT OF PROPOSITION 61: 
The $64,000 compensation limits proposed by Gann would apply to all employees 
of the UC, Cal State, and the Community CoUege Systems in our state. 

1) Annual compensation levels of public higher education preSidents, 
Chancellors, and many professors would face immediate cUI ·backs. 

"As a result of these monetary and benefits reductions, the California 
educational system will face mass resignations by tor administrators and 
faculty who will rurn to universities in other parts 0 the nation or to the 
private sector. . 
"Proposition 61 will also cause a restructuring of pay scales, wh ich would 
consequently cause a downward shift in aU salaries in the state, including 
those 93% of university employees who earn less than $64,000. 

2) Proposition 61 would also immediately put California out of market 
competition for top medical and legal professionals. for toxies expertS, for a 
variety of other top technical skills, and for the major public managers and 
administrators for which California is in national competition. 

IF PROPOSITION 61 PASSES, CAUFORNlA'S PRESTIGIOUS HIGHER 
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM WlU SUFFER GREATLY, AS WlU MANY OTHER 

ESSENTIAL PUBLIC SERVICES.
