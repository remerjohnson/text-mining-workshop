LEGACY: Student were 
originally arre ted March 12 
after anti-CCRI demon tration 
By Terry Lew 
News Editor 

Although the book remains open on the ali -
fomia Civi l Ri gh ts Init iati ve ( CRI ) it ·elf. the 
chapter on the 18 UC students arrested in March 
during an anti-CCRI protest drew to a close last 
Thursday. ' 

The students, mostly from U SO, were 
charged wi th failing to disperse - a misde-
meanor under the California Penal Code - and 
blocking an intersection, an infraction underthe 
San Diego Municipal Code. 

The students all plead gui Ity to the infraction 
on Oct. 10. in exchange for the city attorne)l 
dropping the misdemeanor charges. Most chose 

. to perform 182 hours of wmmunlty service in 
lieu of a fine or jai l time. 

''The tudents were offered the opportunity 
to plead guilty to the infraction, whi.ch docs not 
carry the same collateral consequences as a 
misdemeanor," attorney ElizaheJ h Maissakian 
said. "[A misdemeanor conviction] could affect 
the jobs people have, or their abi lity to be 
accepted by graduate schools or law schools." 

If the students rejected the deal, the citse 
could have gone te trial - although Maissakian. 
who acted as a liaison between the tudents, 
their lawyers and the court, said a trial was 
unlikely.

UCSD's Political 
Pundits Host Panel 
FORUM: Campus experts predict outcome of 
presidential race, analyze candidate positions 
Chrlstln. Rhudy 
GuardIan Reporter 

Several of UCSD's mo st 
prominent political minds formed 
a panel Tuesday, at the Graduate 
School of International Relations 
and Pacific Studies. in order to 
discuss the uJX:oming presiden-
tial election. 

Panelists included UCSD po-
litical scientist Sam Popkin, media 
expen and Professor of Communi -
cations Dan Hallin, UCSD econo-
mist Ross Starr and Gerald War-
ren. editor-at-large for the San 
Diego Union-Trihune. 

UCSD Dean of Social Sciences 
Paul Drake moderated the discus-
sion, which fea-
tured commentary 
on the approaching 
election and also an 
analysis of how the 
candidates have ad-
dressed national is-
sues. 

continues to ri se in importance as 
an important mean of relaymg m-
formation to the public, Hallin said. 

Hallin disagreed with network 
claims Ihat thi s new method mixes 
politics with show business, and 
that there is lillie news to be found 
at these conventions. Conventions 
enable Ihe parties to put forth a 
vision of what the party is and what 
it stand for, he said. 

Hallin continued to praise the 
conventions by saying that they 
serve as " big political rallies (and) 
deserve to be taken seriou Iy." 

Slarr addressed the economic 
issues of the campaign, issuing a 
warning to the audience not 10

promises ullered 
by a candidate on

trail.

Popkin also 
commented on the change of re-
gional pany loyalties throughout 
the country. For the first time since 

I 1964, a Democratic candidate was 
cheered in Arizona. while Repuh-
lican candidate Bob Dole cam-
paigned heavily in Utah in orderlo 
strengthen the party's Congres-
sional base in the state. 

Dole's final move, Popkin be-
lieves. will be a return to an em-
phasis on Clinton's character 
Ilaws. Such an allempt wi II prob-
ably be unsuccessful because 
most of Clinton's character flaws 
are already known to the voting 
puhiic. 

Whcn asked if he believed if 
Dole had a chance for the presi-
dency, Popkin responded that il 
was "hard to i maginc a turnaround 
lin Dole's favorl ." 

Hallin discussed the role the 
media plays' in the election pro-
cess. ln recent years, the focus of 
the nominaling convention has 
shifted from an arena to show-
case party platforms to "pack-
aged conventions fortelevision," 
he said. 

This year' s conventions were 
more seripted because television 

grams such as 
Social Security and Medicare. 
He allributes this to the fact that 
the fi rst baby boomers wi II col-
lect benefits at full rates in 
2010. 

Warren concluded the discus-
sion by agreeing with Popkin and 
Starr's observations that there was 
"very lillie doubt" that Clinton wi II 
win the Presidential election in 
November. 

However, Warren said that 
Clinton's re-election is far from 
guaranteed, particularly since re-
cent political polls in California 
seem to be undergoing a subtle 
change in Dole's favor. If Clinton 
loses in California, it may be diffi -
cult for him to capture the presi-
dency for a second time, Warren 
said. 

Warren also spoke of the "[ndo-
nesian Effect" on the Clinton ad-
ministration, referring to rumors 
that Indonesian money has been 
flowing illicitly intoClinton'scarn-
paign. 

Warren assured the audience that 
there were many excellent report-
ers working on the story, and that 
"if there is anything there. it will be 
found."

Administration Claims Open Discussion 
Was a Success Despite Low Turnout 
FORUM: Watson and 
other officials discuss 
student concerns 
By Mary HIUlna 
Associate News Editor 

Even though fewer students at-
tended this year's first "Open Dia-
logue with Student Affairs" than 
adminsitrator had hoped. there was 
till plenty to discuss at Tuesday's 

meeting in the Price Center. 
Vice Chancellor of Student Af-

fair Joe Watson, Associated Stu-
dents President Colcen Sabatini and 
Graduate Student Assoc iati on 
President Vicki Mayer hosted the 
program, held in the Price Center's 
Davis/Ri verside room. 

Students were encouraged to 
share their questions, comments, 
experiences, ideas and concerns 
with Watson. the live college deans 
and representives of everal cam-
pus offices. 

Students and adminislratorsdis-
cussed sexual-harrassment com-

plaint procedures, fee increases, i n-
tercollegiate athletics, eampus so-
cial life and studenl safety . 

According to Sabatini , students 
are confused about UCSD's sexual-
harrassment policy. 

One student who claimed to have 
been sexually harrassed at UCSD 
said many staff members and stu-
dents are unclear about the com-
plaint procedure. 

According to Student Policies 
and luidical Affairs Director Nick 
Agui lar, the Sexual Harassment 
Pol icy and Prevention (S HPP) of-
lice attempts 10 mediate between 
the complainant and the accused 
before complain ts become di ci -
plinaryaffairs. 

" When [mediation] fails. it' . 
because the accused insis ts on 
due process and then there is a 
hea ring," Aguil ar said . "r~t thi s 
point] it becomes a disciplinary 
problem." 

Agui lara lso said SHPP provides 
exual-harrassment preventalion 

programs, as well as counseling 

services. 
Forum participants also dis-

cussed the potential for bringing 
NCAA Division II atleti c to 
UCSD. 

A .S. Vice Presidenl Internal 
Greg Field was one of the students 
present at the meeting who argued 
that such a change might empha-
sizea feeling of unity among UCSD 
students. 

''This campus is sore ly lacking 
in community. " Field said. HI think 
that ' s the one thing that' s holding 
us back." 

Rooseve l t j unior Alexandra 
Webber, an A .S. senator, also 
broached the idea of stimulating 
community spiri t by establishing 
more on-campus, 24-h ur study 
facilities such as the Lihrary 
Lounge - as well as all -nightl'Of-
fee houses. 

Assistant Vice Challl:ellor of 
Academic Service Carmel Myers 
suggested that college cafeteria 
hours be ex tended so that students 
can gather in a public place 10 study .

So why the poor turnout? Three words : No free alco-
hol. AI past TG's, students 2 1 and over were entit led to 
IW,? free drinks. But because of complaints from students 
under 21 that their mandarory student fees were being 
used 10 pay for something only people over 21 could 
enjoy, TG organizers have stopped serving alcohol regu-
larly. 

But let 's examine these complaints more closely. By 
Ihe logic of these complaints, no student should be 
forced to pay for something that he or she does not or 
cannot take advantage of. But what about all the students 
who have neilher the time nor the inclination to attend 
TG's? What if they don't like any of the bands that are 
featured? Why should they be forced to pay for some-
thing ihey don't take advantage of'? By this logic the A.S. 
would have no right to put on events that didn'l satisfy 
everyone. Seeing that this is impossible, it would be 
wrong f9r A.S. to pay for any programming at all with 
mandatory student fees . 

This. however, is clearly absurd. It is the mission of 
Ihe A.S. 10 serve sludents by making the most out of Ihe 
dollars allocated for programming. If this means serving 

I alcohol at TG's, then serve alcohol at TG's. 
A.S. Programming has done a good job lining up the 

TG's for this quarter, and they would do even better to 
continue the successful policy of serving alcohol. This 
campus wants and desparately needs successful TG's . 
The A.S. should by all means bring on the booze.

WiI IIIIIJrOV8 StIldenl ute 

On Tues ., Oct. 22 and Wed ., Oct. 23. Muir College 
sludents will hav!! the opportunity to vote on a proposed 

. slud!!nt-aclivily fee. This proposal would levy a modest 
$2 per quarter fee thai would raise $19.000 annually for 
Muir College aClivilies . 

During the recent years of lean budgets , Mui r College 
has seen its programming budgel decrease from $37,707 
for the \990-91 academic year to $15 ,900 for the 1996-
97 academic year. This has had a crippling effeCI on the 
number and scope of activilies planned by Ihe Muir 
Programming Board. 

If Muir College is going to mainlain a vital. positive 
and worthwhile slate of a~ tivities, Muir. students musl 
vote yes on this modes't proposal. lude llt ~ would have to 
pay only $6 for the entire academic year to vastl y 
improve the quality of life at Muir College. 

Compare this modest proposal to the defeated referen-
dum on last spring 's general election ballol that would 
have assessed all UCSD students $29.50 per quarter to 
pay for expanded sports programs. 

The Muir College Activity Fee proposal i!'> an example 
of the way student government should work. It should 
work with the best interc~ ts of students al heart , aim for 
reasonable. limited goals and n01 try 10 force poli c ies on 
the whole student body. tudent gowrnmcrlI works best 
when it is localized and limited . Two thumbs up to the

high-speed chase last May. Sheriff's deputies are 
trained to use their batons only after issuing a verbal 

warning. If a warning does not suf-
tice, deputies can auempt a control 
hold. If Ihat proves ineffective, 
deputies can utilize chemical agents 
such as pepper spray. After that , 
deputies can display the batons as a 
warning. Only after displaying them 
can batons be used to restrain a per-
son. If none of the above works, 
thcn ollicers may use the baton to 
beat the hell out of the suspect. 

Granted, he thought everyone 
was out to get him because he sur-

However. of all the people he 
thought were out to get him, includ-

poli(;e were especially significant. 
This is evident in the majority of hi s

At least the deputies were not so

'cuz those people are criminals and 
I' m not." What really smell like lies 
are the tatements of pol ice offi ccrs 
who defend their colleagues' illegal

Once, while helping a child with

Leadership. 
With the position of pre ident 

again up for grabs, we've heard thi s 
word a great deal lately. Again, two 
men whose ambitions are ecl ipsed 
only by their egos aspire to posi-
tions beyond their capabilities. 

It seems that in every presiden-
tial election we pair off a ham-
handed huckster with a sli ck charla-
tan. Each is then charged with the 

. ta k of convincing the television-
befuddled voting populace that he 
is specially imbued with the ethere-
al quality of leadership in the glad-
iatorial arena we call politics. So 
what is this thing we call leadership 
anyway, and what does it have to do 
with the presidency? 

Bill Clinton can allend another 
hundred fund-raisers for disabled 
chi ldren, jut his famous jaw out in 
feigned sorrow after another 
botched U.S. foreign military oper-
ation and the rest of us will sti II see 
him for what he is: an overgrown

True leadership Is

work. H means 
making tough, 
unpopular choices 
and then weathering 
the crltlclSlll that 
accompanies them. 
needy appetite for being liked is 
surpassed only by his remarkable 
glibnes . 

To see Clinton, one might come 
to the conclusion that "leadership" 
means trying to run ahead of the 

Ilock, to be the trend-selling fash-
ion leader, cver ready to (;ompro-
mi 'e principles for the sake of pop-
ularity. To Clinton. Icadcrship 
seems to mean linding out where 
the' ma~~es arc headed and racing w

Just when you ask yourself how 
in the world voters could have 
elected such a halllster to the high-

Bush, the itinerant wanderer.

was to break a camflaign promise

Kerry KeylGuird,in 
"WhIsky Week": The Descendents kick off a week of sold-out 
shows at the Whisky in Los Angeles to crowds of adoring fans. 

The reunited Descendents -
the legendary '80s band who 
invented "chainsaw" pop-punk -
recently finished its hyped week of 
sold-out shows at the Whisky in 
Los Angeles, supporting its new 
album. Everything Sucks. In the 
highly anticipated release, the band 
recaptures its original tight, hard-
hitting sound and catchy, anthem-
like lyrics. 

On the first night of "Whisky 
Week," the Guardian 
interviewed Descen-
dents vocalist Milo 
Aukerman, drummer 
Bill Stevenson and bass 
guitarist Karl Alvarez, 
discussing their reunion 
(or "mutated" line-up of 
ALL, sans Milo), caf-
feine addictions and 
Aukerman's Ph.D. in biochemistry 
(from UCSD, incidentally). 
Amongst other things, the band 

membe~ demonstrated the same 
quirky humor prevalent in their 
music. 
t:u.dIn: WMt prampted 
the Detcendents to ...... 
.............. ,...7 

Aukerman: Well, I was doing 
science for obviously many years 
and was actually down at UCSD 
for part of thai time. I kept in con-
tact with tl)e ALL guys fairly 

closely over the years just via 
doing the backing vocals. They 
end me~apes of their music all the 

time and then I just give them 
some input. This last January or 
February I actually stalled writing 
music again for the first time in 
quite a while just because I was so 
busy doing science. J was just rcal-
Iy getting on' on it. I had forgottcn 
how much fun it could be. J gave 
Bill a call, said, "Hcy, can we work 

on some new songs? 
What do you think about 
collaborating on some 
new songs?" 

The whole thing was 
just so positive. [ had so 
much positive energy it 
just kind-of tumed into a 
balloon. It then just bal-
looned into a full scale 

deal with a record. 
Stevenson: From our end of it, 

we of course were already playing' 
anyway. There wasn't a reunion, it 
was just that Milo kind of came 
home. He's always kind of been 
there as a fifth member anyway. 
He's obviously kind of prioritized 
his lab stuff over the music which 
is really understandable because 
it's really an obsessive field. For 
the time being we've got kind of a 
two-headed baby situation. Chad is 
still the ALL singer. He's managed 

to take a breather right now. We 'vc 
managed to bring Milo back into the 
picture without pushing Chad out. 
So is ALL still together as a 
band? 

Stevenson: Yeah, it 's kind of a 
two-headed baby, that 's the only 
way J can express it. I r you notice 
even on the new record Chad helped 
out with all the backing vocals. Its 
more or a mutation than a reunion. 
Reunion doesn 't seem to mean any-
thing in this context. 
MIo, what wu yow major at 
UCSD? 

Aukerman: [ majored in bio-
chemistry as an undergraduate and 
.... ent back there to graduate school 
as well and just got a standard biolo-
gy Ph.D. I worked with Bob 
Schmidt. He was part of the plant 
biology crew. He was my advisor 
and he's a 101 of fun. Those were the 
glory days as far as I was concerned. 

[One of the new songs] is rela-
tively biographical about what I 

Kerrv Kevl Gu.1ld,an 

would call Illy environment thac, at 
my lab in Wi~consi n . I've ju~t nCl:n 
frustrated with science. Science ban 
incredible chance to be creative and 
to think creatively and to get your 
br.lin working on sturr. But then you 
just get hogged down with tl:chnical 
details and this kind or shit. Then 
there's just the general academic 
environment. 
So how do you guys like the 
new album? 

Stevenson: I think it \ rad! 
Aukerman: Thi~ is the first 

record of ours that we have done 
where I can listen to it anerward~ 
and not cringe. I just have that way 
with a 101 of the old Descendents 
~tulf where I'm like "yikes." This b 
the first one where I was like 
"yeah!" 

Stevenson: There were some 
things about it that fcll together in an 
almost peculiar organic way. It rung 
kind of unique to .ne. It had a unique

The Red House Paintcrs added a

"S illy Love Songs." They d i~ tort 
the song with a Neil Young influ-
enced e lectric gnarl and enhance it 
with " musing pedal-steel.

Hail ing from Philade lphi a, the 
~ i x - ma n ba nd known as thc Roots 
has rece ived much acc laim fro m 
bo th fans and non-fa ns of hip-
ho p alike since the release of it s 
ri r !>l alhum. 

The Roots arc oft en touted as 
a hi ghl y cxpe rimental and truly 
musica l group beca u e of its non-
use of the hip-hop e lemcn! of 
samples ori g inating fro m play ing 
records on turntables. 

Neverthc less, it is n' t deemed 
by hip-hop heads as artifi cial or 
"untrue" (unlike many of the so-
called ex peri menial rap groups 
that have dabbled in the use of 
li ve instrument s to replace the 
essential hip-hop clement of the 
OJ 5). 

The Roo ts have enjoyed 
crossover success where so many 
olbe rs have not because they've 
been able to (.; apture a "true" hip-
hop sound - with skill ed lyri-
cists, an amazing human beat box 
and a drummer that drops simple, 
hut ~ I amming drum lines. 

As wi th the ir first album, Do 
YOIl Wall! More? ?!! ? the Roots 
continue to provide all the beat s, 
rhymes and life. This collabora-
tive skill makes lIIade/,}1I Halflife 
one of the best hip-hop albums of 
the year,

lit 

-. ... 

After honing its sound in North -
eas t arenas for almost a year, Bat- t 
tershell's debut alb um signi fie s a 
punk sound wi th great potential. 

SUll shi"e in Popopia (.;an be 
desc ribed a~ a refreshing. light-
hearted albu m in which the songs 
and overall fee l could definitely 
fall under the labe l "fantasy love 
punk." This brand includes pop 
melodies coupled with heavy guitar 
chords and loud voca ls, producing 
a sound similar to The Muffs. 

Lyricall y, the record is simple 
and docs not dea l with any heated, 
controversial issue or deep emo-
tional entanglements, Instead, a 
"laissez- faire" attitude is taken to 
Tammy Lynn's lyrics. The ongs on 
the album arc just anecdotes about 
family and fri ends that work well 
with the spirit ed and cheerful 
melody of Battershell. Such a sin-
cere approach results in a sort of 
twangy country sound with punk 
rock overtone that resonate in 
SII"shille i" Popopia.

From the convict's fami-

truly crippling effects on 
every person involved. 

Sam Cayhall (Gene

inmate in America, is due to face 
the gas chamber for the 1967 mur-

Secrets and, Lies 
Film delves' into intimacy 

By JamI Lof&NM 
Guardian Reporter 

The flashes of a photographer's 
camera jump cuI from one subject to 
the next: a hirsute canine whose 
owner can't stop primping it, a dour-
faced matron and her slap-happy 
spouse and an irritated 
couple bickering about 
readjusting jewelry and 
clothing. 

This montage 
sequence in British direc-
tor Mike Leigh's "Secrets 
and Lies," offers a cine-
matic contrast to the 
film 's ultimate g081-
candidly revealing the most intimate 
and banal ituations of average peo-
ple. 

The film opens with a burial. It is 
the mother of Hortense, a black 
optometrist. After the death of her 
only family relation, her mother by 
adoption, Hortense seeks out her 
biological mother. Until they unite, 
the film fluctuates between scenes 
of Honense's modish flat and the 
dilapidated home of her binh moth-
er, Cynthia. She is a white, unmar-
ried factory worker, supporting her-
self and another daughter- an 
ingrate with a permanent scowl 
clamped around a cigarelle. 

As tension mounts between the 
mother and daughter, Cynthia's 
middle-class brother - photograph-
er Morris - remains quiet and dis-

! tant. Hortense unwillinJ!ly inter-

venes in Cynthia's growing isola-
tion by phoning the lonely woman. 
The call is serendipitous, sa lvaging 
Cynthia from quiet desperation. The 
women overcome their initial shock 
and · awkwardness as they spend 
time together and compare notes 

about their lives. "Secrets 
and Lies" culminates in a 
cat hart ic crescendo when 
Cynthia reveals her past 
to her family, unleashing 

. repressed resentment and 
emotion among the fami -
ly members. 

Leigh "discovers" his 
films wi th his casts. Their 

input helps materialize Leigh's ini-
tially vague conception of charact!!r 
and plot. Hi oeuvre of fi lms con-
stitutes a genre based on this 
process. His lilms rely on strong 
character performances that come to 
fruition during the filming, and plots 
that are Illorc arrived at then con-
trived. 

The genuine performances, idio-
syncratic characters and rendering 
of an hone t account of normal pe0-
ple in slightly absurd si tuations, 
overshadows the irony of racial dif-
ference between mother and daugh-
ter (8 subtle poke at England's racial 
homogeneity). Like the majority of 
independent and foreign films, 
"Secrets and Lies" takes its time to 
tell a story, and seems to defy the 
cookie-CUller pallem of most Holly-
wood films.

boards) that typify today 's hip-
hop songs. 

With such outstanding pro-
duction , it 's easy to overlook the 
album 's equally stellar lyri cs. 
which include outstanding 
rhymes from the Root . emcees 
like B.R.O.T.H .E.R. on songs 
like "Epi sodes" and reall y ele-
vate the albulll to classic status. 

A big ractor in the band 's suc-
cess is it s variety from its in stru-
ments and emcees. 

Gifted guest lyricists such as 
Common Sense on "UNIverse at 
War" and A Tribe Called Quest\ 
Q-Tip on "ltal (the Uni versal 
Side}." as well as platinum 
singer/writer/producer D'Angelo 
contribute to "I lladelph Haltlife." 
These contributions illuminate the 
album's eclectic sense of collabo-
ration of the best from all over. 
one of the founding notions of 
what hip-hop is supposed to be. 

The final element that makes 
the Roots album stand out and 
legitimizes their position as true 
hip-hop arti sts is that by li s ten ing 
to .heir songs or even watching 
them live. one can tell that 
they ' re dedicated. true hi p-hop 
fans_ 

Throughout their songs the 
band members sample sound 
bites from classic hip-hop joints 
and flip them into something 
new. Not surpri singly, those who 
listen to their work seem to be 
just as into their music as they 
are . 

The Roots will perform at the 
Belly Up Tavern on Friday. Oct. 
25 al 10:30 p.m.

CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD 

It 's not really his title, but it's definitely his job. 
Met him on campus a couple of years ago. Someone knew 

someone who knew him. Up to his eyeballs in ASICs, with some off the 

wall ideas about a high speed, board-level remote access solution. 

His first response to us: "Yeah, right. H 

So we reminded him about our bold tech'nical 

leadership. Except for being surrounded by state-of-the-art 

everything, the sharpest minds in technology and the world 's 

leading systems organization, we told him, he'd practically 

be left alone to develop his ideas. Mr. Autonomy. 

YA _ ••• 

Since then he took his idea about 

remote computing to the Nth degree. Now it's part of our 

newest PCMCIA based remote network computing solutions. 

Which brings us back to campus. This semester we're 

scouting the country again, looking for more spirited people and 

Ideas. We're pushing this company to the Nth degree. 

And you oan take u. there . .

Why did you release the

You guys have been a major

because there is always thi s thing

we're not fa mous. One of my friends

We just writc songs about farting, 
it 's not our problem. BUI it 's betler to

"I thinJc.the first goal kind of caught

good for us because we had trouble 
scoring [in the St. Thomas game). It 
definitely helps to have tough compe-

It was only two games ago that 
the UCSD men's soccer learn was 
riding a nine-game winning streak. 

~ 
MEN 'S 
:fITli~ ~ 

Scoring nearly 
double the number of 
goals their opponents 
could muster and 
bealing every team 
from Point Loma to 
Pomona, the Tritons 
were dominating. 

......... iiii.. Considering these. 
statistics, it is di sappointing to see 
the Tritons drop their second con-
secutive game at home 
- day before having to 
race Division I power 
University of San Diego 
- and slowing their 
momentum into the play-
offs. 

UCSD was shut out 
last Monday night at 
home by The Master' s 
College, 2-0, for their 
second loss in a row. The 
defeat dropped the Tri -
tons' record to 9-4. 

eventful. as neither team produced 
any scoring opportunities. 

The second half consisted of 
more hard. defensive play. In tlte 
eyes of the Tritons. the Mustangs 
were playing a lillie too hard. 

The reponse came from the bench 
in the form of complaints from 
UCSD players about the lax behav-
ior or the rereree. 

"The call s the rereree made 
wouldn ' t have changed how the 
game ended," Newcomber said. " It 
is easy to blame the referee for any 
los our team gets." 

Scoring finally took place in the 

second half. but it was to the Tri-
tons' dismay instead of delight. In 
the 64th minute. Dan Hensley capi -
talized on the poor position of goal-
keeper Jason Reynoso, scoring on a 
pass from Steven Palm on the right 
side and staking the Mustangs a 1-0 
lead. 

To make matters worse, the 
overly-physical Mu tangs again 
notched a goal 15 minutcs later. 
Mustang Bryan Lee notched the 
sco re from direc tly in front of the 
goal aft er a fast break, incrcasi ng 
the Master 's lead to 2-0. 

In additi on to being shut out. the 
Tritons fai led to exploit 
several scoring opportuni-
ti es. Ocampo attempted 
fi ve shots on goal, whi Ie 
classmate and fellow fo r-
ward Nate Hetherington 
tried four times to score. 

"What hurt us was our 
lack or intensity and 
exaustion ." Ncwcomber 
said. "We have been a linle 
ti red on the field."

Polo Smacks Aggies, Broncos 
EVEN: Looking to show their stuff against the best in the West, the 
UCSD men's water polo team came away with two victories - against 
Div I Santa Clara and Div. II UC Davis - at the NorCal Tournament 
By Chrl. Lee 
Staff Writer 

Last week.end UCSD sent its 
men's water polo team to the 
NorCal Water Polo Tournament 

at Pacific Univer-
sity, and emerged 
on Sunday with a 
2-2 plil. At least 
statistically, that is. 

While not im-
proving on their 
previous 9-4 
record , the Tritons 

defeated a good UC Davis team 
and played a powerful Stanf6rd 
squad tough for the first three 
quarters . 

Although staying close with 
the Cardinal is no small task for 
any team, UCSD was down only 
3-2 at the half. and only 7-4 after 
three quarters. But three out of 
four is not enough , and it cer-
tainly wasn't against the Cardi -
nal. 

"We played well throughout 
the game." Head Coach Denny 
Harper said, "but we didn ' t 
handle the pressure down the 
stretch and (we) made a couple 
of mistakes that put the game 
out of reach." Stanford eventu-
ally won, 12-4. 

Then came the match against 
Santa Clara. a rapidly improving 
team that the Tritons had already 
defeated three times this year. 

The fourth time proved to be no 
different, with UCSD prevailing. 
8-7. 

"Because we had already beat 
this team three times. we really 
had no motivation to play." 
Harper said. "We played not 10 
lose, but fortunately we came out 
of it with a win." 

With no seniors on the squad, 
the Tritons start two freshman 
and two sophomores. With in -
experience comes inconsis -
tency. and certainly this year th 
eteam has seen its shares of ups 
and downs. Harper is, however, 
pleased with his team ' s 
progress . Can he win his 10th 
NCAA championship this sea-
son? 

"Well, we are not out of the 
conference championships," 
Harper said. "but the UC Davis 
win helped us out in many 
ways." 

On Sunday, the Tritons met 
UC Davis, which was ranked 
ninth in the Western Water Polo 
Association going into the tour-
nament. UCSD played one of 
its better games in the last sev-
eral weeks, winning the match, 
7-6 . 

Strong performances by Adam 
Bollenbach and Ross Mecham, 
who scored two goals apiece, pro-
pelled the team to the huge vic-
tory.

"The victory was huge in lhc 
sense that it gave the team added 
confidence. and it al 0 helped our 
chance in our conferenc e." 
Harper ' aid . 

UCSD, playing in the same 
conference a UC Davis. has 
now won two out of three head-
to-head meetings between the 
teams this season . and has prob-
ably moved ahead in the stand-
ings . 

After their win over UC Davis 
came a loss to l,.ong Beach State. 
a game which took place after 
only two hours of rest - a policy 
that the coaches and players 
would like to see changed in the 
future. The lack of rest showed in 
the 10-5 defeat , but ending the 
tournament on the negative note 
did not sour the Triton ' overall 
good play throughout the week-
end . 

"Our defensive mindset im-
proved greatly , and the UC 
Davis win did a lot for our con -
fidenee, " Harper said . "But we 
must get consistent play from 
everyone on the' team, and not 
just good individual play from 
two or three players. If we can 
h'l.ve five to six guys play good 
polo for an hour, our team can 
only get beller." 

UCSD will next play in the 
Ml. Baldy Convergence Tourna-
ment this weekend.

With the postseason approach-
ing and the team beginning to hit its 
stride, McFarland wants to makc 
slIre that the Triton don ' t begin 
looking too far ahead of themselves. 

"We're taking our matches one 
at a time," McFarland said. "We' ve

And the quarterback isn't anybody 
without a receiver. He is the guy 
who generally receives the ball , 
like Jerry Rice or Herman Moore. 
Go figure . Then he runs, dodges, 
spins and then he's tackled. End 
of story . 

Also the quarterback needs a 
good running back like Barry 
Sanders or Terrell Davis. They 
can ' t catch like a receiver, but they 
sure can run like one. They usu-
ally start behind the quarterback, 
and have to run through the line 
(gulp) berore they go anywhere 
else. 

They are probably the most 
agile and courageous players on 
the field, concidering they are paid 
to run into gridiron monsters like 
Greg Lloyd . 

There are also many other im-
portant terms in football, like 
down. No, not the direction. A 
team gets a first down when they

been training hard and playing a 
lot of matches. 1 think we're really 
looking forward to playing in fron t 
of a home crowd again." 

The Tritons ha ve a good chan~e 
of entertaining a home crowd when 
the postsea on comes around. With 
a quality showing against their next 
few opponents. including Cal Lu. 
UCSD has a strong shot at hosting 
the NCAA Dl vi ion III Regional 
in mid-November. The Tritons are 
hoping that playing at home treat 
them as well a. the road has. 

four chances to cover that muc(--
ground. Then they get another 
first down. This is an endle s cycle 
until the team scores or gets a 
turnover. 

Turnovers are u ually what 
warrants the most yells and boos 
from a crowd. That means the team 
who had the ball , doesn', anymore. 
Fumbles, interceptions ... whatever. 
They all means the coach is going 
to yell at someone during the next 
practice . 

All those other people on the 
sidelines don ' t mean milch, not to 
me anyway. But the last group of 
people that deserve mention arC- ' 
the referees. 'Who else can make 
the "Macarena" look. so official? 

So. 1 hope this has helped any-

OK ... don ' t let the titl e 
mislead you. I know many 
women understand and even 
love the port of football -
myself included. But I have 

>had many women approach 
me with questions about the 
sport that has sing le-handed ly 
revolutionized Mo nday 
nights. 

So allow me to ex plain my 
point of view. 

First, one must understand 
the scoring opportuniti es 
presented to a tea m. The most 
common is the six -point 
touchdown. Thi s i when a 
player runs with the ball or 
catches it in the end zone, 
throws it on the ground and 
does a little dance. That is, 

.unless you are a Green Bay 
Packer, and in that case,you

I Ho Hum, Tritons 
Blow Out AZusa 
DOMINATING: Recording their 10th shutout of 
the season, the Tritons dominated Azusa Pacific 
By Sean Rahlml 
Sports Editor 

The defending NCAA Division 
1/1 ational Champi ons are build-
ing a reputation: Play hard against 

them or get blown to 
smithe reens. 

With the attitude 
of a lion about to prey 
on a wounded crea-
ture" the UCS D 
women 's soccer team 
goes about its bu i-
ness of tallying more 

curved the ball over all the defend-
ers and the Cougar goa lkeeper -
Charmaigne Rossele'- to an awai t-
ing Beth Freeburg, who converted 
on a header into the empty net for 
the successful backdoor play and a 
very earl y 1-0 lead. 

UCSD continued to pu h for-
ward, pUlling pressure on the Cou-
gar defenders. And at the' 14:33 
mark , Shelbi Thiele picked up a 
loose ball atlhe top corner of the 18-
yard box and curved a long shot 
over the head of Rosselle for the 2-
o margin.

Ei ther way the player

team to elect from two 
options. 

Option one: kick for the

times the result is a 2-0 victory. 
Other times it is a 5-0 or 7-0 batter-
ing, leaving no doubt who the supe-
rior team i . 

The second Triton goal seemed 
to awaken the Azusa players, as the 
Cougars controlled the field for the 

. rest of the half. 
Speedy: Freshman Janine Harispe (left) scored her first collegiate 
goal yesterday, one of five Triton goals In a 5-0 win over Azusa. 

Option two : the two-point 
~onvers ion . The te!'ms line up 
again, but thi s time throws or 
runs the ball into the end-
zone where the ball carrier 
does the touchdown ritual 
(see above).

,campaign, !he :rrit0!l~ defeat~d an 
opponent by a score of 5-0, pum-

night with scoring contributions 
from five different players, 

In improving their record to 12-
I, UCSD inched closer to the No. I 
ranking. Triton Head Coach Brian 
McManus' squad is currently ranked 
No. 2 in the nalion. 

Looking to get off to a quick 
start, the Tritons won a corner kick 
on the right side in the first minute 
of last night's contest. Lauren 
Johnson, comer kick extraordinaire, 

"It was a good, fa t-paced game," 
McManus said . ''They were prob-
ably better than the last two teams 
we played. They were very aggres-
sive. But I think that we scored 
some goal tonight that were some 
of the best goals 

Alison Hurley, the first players off 
the bench, combined to increase the 
lead to 3-0 when Hurley 's attempted

box seemed destined to go wide

Hurley decided to notch a goal of 

her own in the second half, and 
opened the scoring at the 53:23 mark 
with another beautiful goal. Picking 
up a loose ball just inside the 18-
yard box, the forward from Poway 
turned a player away and booted a 
left-footed , swerving kick into the 
back of the net for her eight goal of 
the season and third in two games. 
With the score at 4-0, Lauren

with an incredible strike from about

McFarland and hi s team arc ex-
cited to be plaYing fo ur of th ei r 
final seven games at ho me. 

After defeating Chri tian Heri-
tage College on Tuesday night , 
the Tritons rai sed their overall 
record to 16-5, with I I of their 
victories coming outside the 
friendly confines of La Jolla . 

The trip to Christian Heritage 
proved to be the shortest of the 
year, as UCSD was only required 
to head east to EI Cajon. De pite 
the minimal amount of mileage, 
the Tritons' good-luck treak on 

the road continued, as the Tritons

McFarland said , "They started out

consistantly . I think that it 
was one of the be t matches 
that we ' ve played all ;;ea-
son." 

With the po tseason just 
aro und th e co rner , 
McFa rland is hoping to 
smooth out any wrinkles the 
team might have before each game 
becomes a high-pressure situation. 
Tuesday 's match gave the Tritons 
a chance to work out any kinks, 
before they head into the toughest 
portion of their schedule, which
