SURF REPORT

UCSD’s first on-campus salon will open at Price Center this Winter Quarter. The 
salon, which will be called Salon 
101, is currently under construction 
on the second floor of Price Center 
East.

Salon 101 will be located next to 
Zanzibar Cafe and the Loft perfor-

mance venue.
A soft opening is expected late 

in Fall Quarter, followed by a grand 
opening early Winter Quarter. The 
soft opening will allow the salon to 
have a short break-in period before 
publicly announcing its grand open-
ing. An exact opening date can-
not be confirmed due to possible 

changes in construction timelines.
Salon 101 will offer hair, skin, 

and nail services such as haircuts, 
coloring, highlights, trims, blow-
outs, facials, waxing, manicures and 
pedicures at affordable prices to all 
members of the UCSD community.

The salon will be run by Claudia 
and Tony Azar, who already own 

another full-service salon and spa, 
Salon de Claude. Salon de Claude 
offers a variety of hair, skin and nail 
services and is located in 4S Ranch, 
a planned community in unincor-
porated San Diego County.

Student 
conduct 
code 
revised

By dANIEL SONG
Staff Writer

A revised UCSD student 
conduct code has been ratified after 
nearly three years of deliberations. 
However, some members of A.S. 
Council do not feel that these 
revisions address the concerns that 
the previous council had about the 
conduct code.

This year’s councilmembers are 
also concerned 
that the changes 
were made 
effective Sept. 
15, but that 
students were 
not notified 
until Sept. 27. 
Associate Vice 
President of 
Student Advocacy Courtney Hill 
brought this delay of notification 
to the attention of the A.S. Council 
during its Oct. 3 meeting. She also 
informed council that this code 
was not approved by Chancellor 
Pradeep  K. Khosla, but instead by 
former Chancellor Marye Anne Fox 
during one of her last days in office 
in July.

Council nearly unanimously 
approved a resolution brought forth 
by Hill that expressed disapproval 
of the actions taken by university 
officials in administering the 
new conduct code and asked for 
corrections of these oversights 
during its meeting on Oct. 10. 
The resolution requested that 
Chancellor Khosla be allowed 
to review and approve the code 
himself, and that university officials 
provide an explanation for the 
delay in notification and have an 
administrative review of the code 
with council representatives over 
the parts of the code they find 
unsettling.

Last year’s council saw a final 
draft of the conduct code in 
the spring of 2012 and passed a 
resolution in opposition on April 18. 
This year’s council shares concerns 
with last year’s council over what 
they see as vague language that can 
be used to prevent students from 
conducting demonstrative peaceful 

Final changes to the code 
were confirmed in July, 
but students were not 
informed unitl October.

FACULTY 

Engineering Dean will 
Depart for Australia

By ALEKSANdRA

Dean of Jacobs School of 

Engineering Frieder Seible has 
announced his decision to retire 
from UCSD following a nine-year 
term as dean. He will remain at 
UCSD until April 2013, when he will 
join Monash University in Australia 
as dean, Faculty of Engineering and 
Vice President of Academics. 

Seible joined the UCSD faculty 
in 1983 as a professor of structural 
engineering, and was appointed 
Dean of Jacobs School in 2003. 
His principal work has focused on 
long-span bridge design, and he has 
authored over 600 papers, primarily 
on the seismic resistance of bridges 
and other critical structures. 

During his tenure, Seible also 

became the Walter J. Zable Professor 
of Engineering, a member of the 
National Academy of Engineering, 
and  a Foreign Fellow of the Chinese 
Academy of Engineering. In a Oct. 
17 article titled “UCSD loses a top 
dean to Australian school,” the 
U-T San Diego reported that Seible 
earned over $350,000 per year as 
dean of Jacobs School.

 In a campus notice sent to 
all UCSD students and staff, 
Chancellor  Pradeep K. Khosla 
commended Seible and said that he 
will maintain close ties with UCSD. 

“The Jacobs School is stronger, 
more innovative and better 
positioned to fulfill its mission of 
educating tomorrow’s technology 
leaders, conducting leading edge 
research and driving innovation, 
and transferring discoveries for 
the benefit of society due to Dean 
Seible’s dedication and leadership,” 
Khosla said.

 Monash is recognized as a top-
tier school in Australia, though the 
U-T   San Diego reported that its 
engineering program did not place 

Salon 101 will open later this year on the second floor of Price Center East near The Loft.

Dr. Linda S. Greene will join 
UCSD as the first ever Vice 
Chancellor for Equity, Diversity, and 
Inclusion on Jan. 1. Greene is cur-
rently the Evjue-Bascom Professor of 
Law at the University of Wisconsin-
Madison, and was chosen for the 
position of VC-EDI after a nation-
wide search, conducted by the UC 
Board of Regents in September 2012.

As VC-EDI, Greene will be work-
ing in partnership with Executive 
Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs Suresh Subramani, as well 
as Chancellor Pradeep K. Khosla. 
UCSD News Center and University 
of Wisconsin-Madison News report-
ed that Greene will head a univer-
sity-wide “diversity strategic plan” 
to promote equal opportunities and 
inclusiveness in UCSD programs. 

Greene will work both within 
and beyond the campus on these 
initiatives, partnering with admin-
istrators from across the UC system, 
local and grade school communities, 
and various other San Diego com-
munity members.

As Associate Vice Chancellor 
from 1999-04 and current law pro-
fessor at UW-Madison, Greene 
made great strides in the areas of 
equity and diversity through diver-
sity initiatives and faculty inclusion-
ary programs. 

Greene led strategic hiring tech-
niques at UW-Madison to increase 
the number of women in science 
and engineering, introduce new 
interdisciplinary scholarships and 
promote the diversification and 
interdisciplinary hiring of faculty. 
This method of hiring, called the 
Cluster Hiring Initiative, increased 
the number of interdisciplinary 
hires at UW-Madison to 150 mem-
bers, according to the UW-Madison 
Women’s Studies Consortium. 

Greene will officially begin her 
new role as VC-EDI in January 2013, 
after completing current affairs at 
UW-Madison.

BrieFS 
On Tuesday, Oct. 16, California 

Gov. Jerry Brown campaigned at 
UCLA in support of Proposition 30. 

The proposition is a sales tax 
increase geared at preventing 
tuition hikes at state colleges and 
universities.  

Opponents of the bill claim the 
tax can be used for general state 
purposes, and not exclusively for 
public education. 

Students in the crowd were over-
whelmingly in favor of the propo-
sition, saying they feared another 
round of tuition increases.

LIGHTS & SIRENS Newly Revised Conduct Code Leaves Questions Unanswered

protests.
 A.S. President Meggie Le 

commended the efforts that went 
into writing this new code and 
acknowledged the necessity of a new 
code. But Le also asserted unease 
about vagueness in the language of 
the code that could lead to an abuse 
of power. 

“There is one clause that 
extremely worries me, specifically 

citing ‘disruptive activity 
incompatible with the orderly 
operation of the campus,’” Le said. 
“This would prevent students from 
protesting on behalf of student 
interests as well as supporting 
workers if they protest.”

Vice President of External 
Affairs Olamide Noah believes that 
the new code has a huge implication 
for the future of student activism at 
UCSD.

“Activism is deeply rooted in 

UCSD’s history, and it would be a 
shame to see our students punished 
for using their agency,” Noah said. 
“A.S. [Council] acknowledges that 
the Conduct Code needs revisions, 
but the changes made to the 
conduct code will have resounding 
effects on our students whether we 
are aware of the changes or not.”

“He will formally commence with

Students Had Expressed Desire for Salon in Price Center Survey

contract for the retail space, pay-
ing a market rate on either a square 
foot or percent of sales basis. They 
will have the authority to design the 
space and invest in the construction 
and equipment.

Salon 101 was chosen through a 
public request for proposal process 
in 2011. The selection committee, 
which included student members 
of the University Centers Advisory 
Board, reviewed the bids and 
ranked them on student-friend-
ly prices, services, sustainability, 
products, sales and atmosphere.

“The hair salon concept has 
been a topic of discussion ever 
since my first day on UCAB, which 

was winter quarter of 2010,” UCAB 
Chair Albert Trujillo said.

The idea for a salon came from 
a student survey that was conduct-
ed before the University Centers 
expansion. The survey focused 
on students’ needs and interests 
in both food and non-food retail 
services.

“Respondents demonstrat-
ed interest in services such as a 
bank, grocery market and hair 
salon, which all became part of the 
retail plan for the expanded Price 
Center,” Interim University Centers 
Director Sharon Van Bruggen said.

UCSD created a hair salon com-
mittee after receiving bids from 
hair salons interested in opening a 
business on a college campus. 

Salon 101 was selected for its 
lease proposal, services, expertise 
and student-friendly philosophy. 
UCAB has participated in giving 
feedback to the salon’s logo, which 
has not yet been determined.

“This is currently my third year 
on UCAB and each of those years 
have seen the salon concept on the 
UCAB agenda,” Trujillo said. “It has 
been a long process, as is the case 
with establishing any new retail 
concepts in University Centers, but 
it is really exciting to see the con-
struction of the salon taking place 
and finally coming together.”

4 THe UCSd GUaRdian |  MOndaY, OCTOBeR 22,  2012 |  www.UCSdGUaRdian.ORG

UCSD is one of the few major universities that has adapted the college system, and with it, a unique set of general education requirements for each college. These dreaded 
GEs are something we all have to deal with eventually, but they are 
somewhat of a grab bag. General education requirements vary far 
too much between colleges — the creation of a set of standardized 
requirements is more likely to be effective in achieving a broad 
curriculum.

UCSD adopted the college system to create individual 
“traditions, general-education requirements, and distinctive 
educational philosophies” within the campus. According to the 
UCSD general catalog, “the choice of a college is not based on 
a student’s major, but on preferences in terms of the various 
educational philosophies offered by the colleges.” For example, 
Thurgood Marshall College focuses on social justice while Eleanor 
Roosevelt College strives to create the “global citizen.” General 
education requirements are beneficial in requiring students to 
take classes in subject areas that they may not explore otherwise, 
but a single set of simplified requirements would be more likely to 
develop well rounded students across colleges at UCSD.

A simple tally of units is all it takes to realize the differences. 
Revelle College tops the list of general education requirements 
with a foreign language requirement and 72 units of general 
education requirements in the fields of writing, math, natural 
science, American culture, social science and fine art. Sixth and 
Warren colleges both require 72 units but their required courses 
vary greatly, and the GE requirements at Warren are reduced to 
48 units for engineering majors to help them graduate on time. 

ERC requires a foreign language series as well as 60 units worth 
of courses that embrace multiculturalism and the “making of 
the modern world”. Marshall College has 60 units of courses that 
center around social activism and Muir College has the fewest 
requirements with 56 units.

Clearly, a degree from one college is in no way equivalent 
to a degree at another. Both the breadth and scope of general 
education requirements lack consistency between colleges. The 
pure number of courses, offered obstensibly to achieve the same 
goal of “broadening the student perspective” makes GEs somewhat 
of a wild card.

In a 2012 survey of graduating seniors taken by the UCSD 
Department of Student Research and Information Student Affairs, 
only 78 percent of students claimed they gained knowledge of 
people from different races and cultures, and only 68 percent 
satisfied were satisfied with their general education requirements. 
General education classes such as the “Dimensions of Culture” 
series at Thurgood Marshall College aim to give students 
knowledge in these areas, but clearly are not completely achieving 
their goals. A streamlined curriculum designed to effectively 
embody the principles of UCSD as a whole may be more effective.

Not only are general education requirements inconsistent 
between colleges, they are also constantly changing. Just two years 
ago, the Making of the Modern World history series requirement 
for ERC was reduced from six courses to five due to budget cuts. 
Although many ERC students were ecstatic at the thought of taking 

Make Some General 
Changes

Either I’ve been thoroughly missing out over the past two years, or UCSD students 
just excel remarkably in creativity. 
“UCSD Confessions,” created last 
weekn, is a Facebook page that posts 
students’ anonymous confessions, 
which are submitted either through 
SurveyMonkey or email. But, I am 
finding it hard to believe many are 
entirely true. The posts range from 
inappropriate solicitations reminiscent 
of Craiglists’ “Casual Encounters” and 
stories of peeing on door handles, to 

raunchy tales of wild party mishaps 
and hook-ups with TAs. From this 
page, one might presume that UCSD 
is a rampant sex-crazed campus, and 
that the campus climate rivals that 
of “Animal House”’s Faber College. 
While I disapprove of the “UC 
Socially Dead” moniker, I am guessing 
that a considerable percentage of 
entries are flat-out figments of 
overactive imaginations, while others 
have been exaggerated for a “cool” or 
“keeping up with the Joneses” factor. 

Stripped of personal accountability, 
anonymous confessions can go one 
of two ways — people may find 
themselves either more prone to 
telling the truth, or more likely to 
exaggerate. In this case, I am leaning 
more toward the latter. On Urban 
Dictionary, searching for UCSD 
brings up snarky entries such as 
“campus with self-described smart 
people who are afraid of socializing 
outside a laboratory” and “10 guys + 
2 cupcakes + 1 dorm room = UCSD 
Party!” While these mockeries are 
harsh, on weekends it does seem to be 
an unfailing phenomenon that Price 
Center is populated with students 
studying.

What I imagine goes down is 
something like this: Equipped with 
what they believe to be a ‘scandalous’ 
confession, people scroll through the 
page only to read others and feel the 
need to take their story up a notch, 
or three. Or 10. Cutting off the “Do 
Not Remove Under Penalty of Law” 
mattress tag suddenly becomes having 
a massive sex-fest on said mattress; 
accidentally leaving all the apartment 
lights on at night becomes holding a 
black light rager where you ‘passed 
out and don’t remember anything’; 
and studying at Geisel library 
becomes hooking up with a professor 
behind a bookshelf.

I once saw a poster in the 
Food Co-Op of an array of young 
celebrity mug shots with statements 
underneath their pictures stating their 
respective crimes. Some captions 
boasted the usual heinous offenses 
— rape, arson, armed robbery — but 
in a little corner sat a goofy shot of 
young Bill Gates with moppy hair 
and oversized 70s nerd glasses with 
the caption, “Traffic Violation.” The 
juxtaposition of this against the others 
made for a very comical effect. The 
same applies to this Confessions page 
— everyone wants their story to top 
the others, and no one wants to be Bill 
Gates in this circumstance.

I could be entirely wrong — 
maybe I should be eyeing these 
biology nerds with suspicion. One 
thing is for sure though: I’d rather 
believe that students are having crazy 
threesomes every night, than accept 
that someone is actually discharging 
bodily fluids into Goody’s guacamole 
sauce.

The TLC reality TV show, “Here Comes Honey 
Boo Boo” a semi-comedic documentary about the 
family of child beauty contestant Alana Thompson 
(nicknamed ‘Honey Boo Boo’), who became famous 
in 2010 when she appeared on the reality series, 
“Toddlers and Tiaras”. This program unfairly makes 
a spectacle out of life in rural America by highlight-
ing unhealthy living and dysfunctionality. 

The makers of the show constantly try to 
demean the characters through unfair cinematic 
techniques. The producers devote over half of run-
time in the third episode to the Thompsons’ greasy 
cooking habits. Extreme close-up shots of dirty dish-
es and sizzling butter on a pan get a full five minutes 
of coverage. Though the point of this was ostensibly 
to explore Alana’s dietary habits, it was actually a 
cheap attempt to take the mundane and make it a 
circus of the bizarre.

The show frequently glosses over Alana’s disci-
pline. The narrator only mentions in passing that she 
practices her modeling routine for three hours a day, 
and instead the show spends nearly 10 minutes on 
Alana’s belly-squeezing antics.  

Though Alana’s family members are not 
ashamed of themselves, the makers of this program 
portray them like they should be. To improve their 
show’s ratings, the producers attempt to portray the 
Thompsons in a grotesque and skewed way.

The unanticipated success of TLC’s new 
reality show “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” 
has come under fire for unfairly lampooning 
the family’s relative poverty and lifestyle. This 
criticism, however, is misplaced.

“Honey Boo Boo” is hardly the first reality 
television show to depict polarizing child 
behavior — the “19 Kids and Counting” series 
has also elicited everything in the spectrum from 
scorn to acclaim. Huffington Post article notes 
that the family receives upwards of $15,000 for 
each episode, enough for the family to forge a 
more comfortable life.

Although the characters may appear vacuous, 
it is important to recognize their qualities. In 
fact, comedian Rosie O’Donnell declared her 
genuine admiration for Thompson’s “presence 
and intellect” in an interview with People 
Magazine. Despite the sometimes-objectionable 
lifestyle choices, the exceptional strength of the 
family’s affection for one another is a model for 
others.

The U.S. is hardly a homogeneous nation 
— television programming should reflect 
its variance from quintessential suburbia by 
balancing representations of wealth and privilege 
with the thrifty and culturally dissimilar lives of 
families such as the Thompsons.

Reality Show is Just Entertainment
Lindsay Lohan, the Olsen twins and Amanda 

Bynes were once bright child stars. Now, as they 
find themselves entering adulthood, those adorable 
memories we had of them are being replaced with 
ones of anorexia, drug abuse and mental instability. 
Alana Thompson is unknowingly on this path. If 
the public, her family, and the TV network don’t 
wake up, her life may very well spiral into disaster.

Captivating or not, Thompson is carelessly 
being deployed as a child soldier in the enter-
tainment industry. Child psychologists and doc-
tors alike emphasize the importance of creating 
authentic friendships as a kid. Thompson, like 
many child stars before her, is being deprived from 
forming these crucial relationships. Former child 
star Christopher Knight, of the 1970s sitcom “The 
Brady Bunch,” attested to this, remarking that there 
exist people who only pretend to be child stars’ 
friends solely because of their stardom.

Thompson will have plenty of time to chase 
money and flaunt her looks later in life. Her moth-
er should be telling her to play outside, not to shake 
her butt. The celebrity bubble developing around 
Thompson is not nurturing a star, but rather 
starving a child who may never get the chance to 
achieve her full potential and grow into a normal 
adult.

one fewer rigorous writing course, a 
move like this causes one to question 
the true necessity of each GE course 
if they are the first to get the axe.

General education requirements 
may just be drowning students in 
unnecessary work that distracts them 
from their major field of study. For 
majors such as communications, 
which requires only 16 courses, there 
may be room for GEs, but for other 
majors, graduating in four years is 
difficult enough without the burden 
of general education requirements. 
The average engineer, for example, 
has to take 200 units worth of 
courses, only offered during certain 

quarters, that must be taken in a very 
specific order. In these cases, students 
may have to extend their time at 
the university and dish out even 
more tuition money. The university 
does recognize this problem, and 
has a form for inter-college transfer 
requests. A student can request a 
transfer if there is a “desirable and 
necessary” need and can graduate 
two or more quarters earlier.

In this way, the university 
recognizes the great differences 
between general education 
requirements and is inadvertently 
trying to solve a problem it did not 
mean to create. Normalizing the 
system would be a more effective 
way to get rid of the problem 

completely. The University of 
Cambridge, for example, which has 
31 different colleges, takes advantage 
of the personalized education 
and community of the college 
system while maintaining the same 
graduation requirements. 

To ensure that students of all 
colleges receive an equally beneficial, 
well-rounded education, UCSD 
should develop a single set of general 
education requirements. These 
requirements should be manageable 
for students of all majors. They will 
allow students to gain the scope of 
knowledge that comes only from 
taking a wide assortment of classes 
without creating the pressure of 
choosing the “easiest college.”

Dear editor, 
I talked with a first-year UCSD 

student and his girlfriend, a first-
year student at Mira Costa College, 
both from Oceanside, last weekend on 
the Coaster urban rail, and they each 
had been waitlisted this academic 
session for three classes.  They will 
be forced into online courses so that 
the new chancellor’s prophecy (a 25 
to 30-percent increase of the number 
of grad students, and a $3 to 4 billion 
increase to UC San Diego’s Foundation 
Endowment) will be fulfilled.  

Incidentally, the chancellor said 
in his interview with the Union 
Tribune that the current balance in the 
foundation was roughly $0.5 billion, 
while the Almanac says $378,506,156. 
I believe the other figures given by the 
Almanac are correct.

Basically, I’m saying that the UCs 
won’t be affected by Gov. Brown’s 
“trigger.” If Proposition 30 fails, each 
of the two university systems will lose 
$250 million.Or rather, I’m saying that 
it’ll be much worse for the CUs — and 
devastating for the CCs.

Alexander King, leader of CSU 
Long Beach, has already drawn the 
governor’s attention to the disparity 
between $5,000 Cal grants for CSU 
students and $9,000 Cal grants for 
students at Point Loma Nazarene 
and USD.  My brother’s Apple shares 
(of which he has scores) are each 
approaching $700 in value.  

A lawyer at Duane Morris in 

Washington, who specializes in 
trade cases, said, “If you want to get 
relief against Apple, it’s going to have 
to be in a foreign forum where it 
doesn’t have the clout or the cachet it 
has at the ITC or the northern district 
of California.” 

Simultaneously, retailers have 
waged a campaign that passed Internet 
sales tax laws in California, New 
York, Illinois, among others.  “Now 
that Amazon has agreed to collect 
sales taxes in California, the challenge 
is to persuade Congress to pass a 
federal law that would set standards 
for collecting levies in every other 
state,” says the California Retailers 
Association President.  

Apple officers skip out of the 
Cupertino headquarters to Reno, 
which is in a state without a 
corporate tax. Private colleges, and 
for profits in particular, here in the 
Golden State, underneath our senior 
U.S. Senator’s skirts are eating out the 
substance of 23 CSUs and 110 two-
year public colleges.

Programs like the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps have been a popular go-to for students 
looking for a buffer between school 
and the “real world.” The premise of 
these programs is, that in return for 
philanthropic work in regions in the 
United States and around the world, 
these non-profit organizations pro-
vide participants relief for loans, a 
steady income and guidance about 
working in the professional world. 
For many, it’s an appealing alterna-
tive to jumping into a conventional 
job right out of school.

Teach For America, one such 
program, recruits high-achieving 
university graduates to undergo 
a five-week training program and 
places them in two-year teach-
ing commitments in low-income 
schools across the country. The 
benefits are competitive: Teachers 
get compensated for training, are 
paid a full salary and benefits dur-
ing their teaching jobs and receive 
stipends that can be used for further 
credential training or to pay off stu-

dent loans.
The program is currently con-

sidering the possibility of openin a 
branch in San Diego.

David Lopez, a manager for TFA, 
said that application rates to the pro-
gram have been increasing steadily 
over the past couple of years. 

“I think that there have been 
in increase in the number of can-
didates over the last three or four 
years when the economy was strug-
gling,” Lopez, who was a TFA mem-
ber back in 2010, said. “We did 
really up our recruitment efforts, 
but some of those candidates are 
coming in because they’re sort of 
wondering exactly what do I do 
next, and having this opportunity to 
work with Teach for America gives 
them that very clear next step.”

On the whole, San Diego school 
districts have been performing at 
proficient, if not high, levels. Reports 
by the San Diego Foundation in the 
past few years, however, reveal a 
discrepancy.

“For most of the communities 

above the I-8 freeway you’re going 
to see a lot of schools that year 
after year students are consistently 
performing above the 90th percen-
tile on standard tests,” Lopez said. 
“When you look below the I-8 free-
way, you see schools where students 
are consistently performing just 
above the 20th or 30th percentile.”

One of the Foundation’s reports, 
published in April 2008, explains 
community members were con-
cerned about a lack of local talent 
entering the many San Diego tech 
companies. The need for more local 
talent has been attributed to the low 
number of San Diego students that 
end up graduating from universities 
with science, technology, engineer-
ing and mathematics degrees.

For this reason, representatives 
from TFA are meeting with commu-
nity leaders to determine whether or 
not it would be beneficial to open 
a branch of the program for San 
Diego school districts. For that to 
happen, the program would need to 
find 50 open positions for recruits 

and be able to provide three years 
worth of funding up front.

UCSD students, many of whom 
graduate with the STEM degrees 
required by such careers, could pro-
vide necessary guidance for stu-
dents. According to Lopez, only 40 
percent of students in San Diego 
are graduating with the required 
amount of credits to attend UCSD.

The data compiled by the 
Foundation indicates the presence 
of the “achievement gap”, a phenom-
enon in which students from certain 
socio-economic backgrounds do 
more poorly in school than others.  

TFA’s mission statement, that 
claims that “16 million American 
children face the extra challenges of 
poverty”, says evidence shows that 
said children can achieve at high 
levels. By placing recruits as teach-
ers in San Diego County schools, 
the hope is to change the culture of 
the school by encouraging higher 
achievement from students, while 
providing students with high quality 
education.

TFA, however, has garnered 
criticism from advocates stating 
the program is not as effective as 
it claims. A review drafted by the 
Education Policy Research Unit at 
Arizona State University claimed 
that first year Teach For America 
members did not make significant 
impacts in math scores, citing that 
on average, it takes three years for 
a member to stay in the program 
before outperforming non-TFA 
teachers, as measured by rising stu-
dent test scores.

The review also criticized TFA’s 
retention rate. According to both 
the Arizona State University report, 
and TFA’s own findings, 50 percent 
of recruits stay with the program 
after the required two years, and 80 
percent leave after their third year.

But Lopez explained how TFA’s 
success at other California school 
districts demonstrate the potential 
for success in San Diego County.

With so many resources at our fingertips in the age of Internet obsession, 
online piracy seems to have grown 
rampant. And it appears that UCSD 
can attest to this.  

In an Oct. 13 report by 
TorrentFreak, a news blog about 
file sharing, UCSD was ranked 18th 
overall in BitTorrent usage among 
all U.S. universities. More signifi-
cantly, our school took the crown 
for the highest-ranking UC school 
at 435 hits — with the exception of 
UC Berkeley trailing behind at no. 

36 with 355 hits and no other UC 
breaking the top 50.

But, according to ResNet 
Coordinator Scott Wu, the pub-
lished statistic is misleading. Wu 
claimed to know that other UCs 
schools have high amounts of file 
sharing, but that UCSD’s network 
policy eases the option for students 
to engage in online piracy.

“One of the reasons why UCSD 
could be pretty high up is that 
we don’t restrict our network like 
other UC schools,” Wu said. “For 
example, I know UC Berkeley has 
a bandwidth cap, meaning you can

But we have unlimited bandwidth 
here, so we don’t restrict students’ 
Internet access. In addition, other 
schools block ports and things like 
that, and we try to avoid that.” 

UCSD’s increased network 
accessibility means that students are 
more prone to racking up copyright 
violations. But this hasn’t induced 
more rigid network restrictions.

“We believe that it’s in the stu-
dents’ rights,” Wu said. “File- shar-
ing itself is not illegal; it’s just what 
they file share that’s illegal, and we 
don’t want to prevent students who 
are actually using file sharing  for 
legitimate purposes from doing so.”

Although UCSD students con-
tinue to have the luxury of more 
online freedom, illegal file sharing 
rates, oddly, have decreased sig-
nificantly over time (though not 
enough to bypass TorrentFreak’s 
radar). 

“We’ve seen our fall [piracy 
rates] go down drastically since 
2009 and 2010,” Wu said. “In 2009-
10, we had about 1,000 copyright 
violations, and the past school year, 
we’ve had about 453.”

The drop in violations can be 
attributed to the administration’s 

adherence to strict protocol in deal-
ing with illegal file sharing. Upon a 
first offense, students are temporar-
ily blocked from the student wire-
less network and instructed to bring 
their computer in for a security 
scan and attend a copyright viola-
tion presentation.

A second offense is treated more 
severely. Students are sent to the 
Office of Student Conduct.

“For a second offense, [a stu-
dent] could be charged $150,” Wu 
said. “[He or she] might have to 
take an ethics course, write a five-
page essay, do community service.”

After three offenses, students 
are permanently blocked from 
the school network and could be 
charged $300. Though the major-
ity of offenses have been first-time 
violations, there have been eight 
second-time offenders and one 
third-time offender within the last 
academic year. 

Despite the decline in copy-
right violations — likely due to 
the severe consequences now in 
place — online piracy remains a 
major issue at UCSD. According 
to statistics released by the Office 
of Student Conduct, the majority 
of illegal torrents and downloads 
are  of television shows and mov-
ies, not music. This is likely due to 

the increased availability of online 
streaming. Students are still getting 
caught for the former two types of 
media as they are harder to find.

According to a survey provided 
by the Office of Student Conduct, 
many violators claim that they were 
unaware that a file-sharing program 
had been downloaded to their com-
puter at the time they were caught. 
But whether intentional offenders 
or not, students should take cau-
tion.

“You don’t actually have to 
download something to get caught,” 
Wu said. “As long as you use a 
torrent or any kind of file sharing 
software — even before you finish 
downloading the file, you’re already 
uploading. And currently, that’s 
how agencies are tracking these vio-
lations — by uploads.”

As for now, UCSD is continuing 
its effort to keep online piracy rates 
down.

“We’re trying our best,” Wu said. 
“We’ve gotten a lot better about 
informing students about the risks 
and consequences. Our hope is that 
with more and more companies 
making media more publicly avail-
able that fall string will go down.”

Smoking to be Stopped on Library Walk

By ayan Kusari
Features Editor

Don’t be fooled by the lofty title, the annual Great American Smokeout 
doesn’t ask much of its participants. 
All you have to do is be a smoker and 
quit for one day. If you’re feeling vir-
tuous, you can donate the money you 
would have spent on cigarettes to the 
American Cancer Society Medical 
Research Fund. Nov. 15 will mark 
the 37th annual Smokeout, a national 
event. This will be the 12th time it’s 
being observed at UCSD.

The UCSD event will be especially 
eye-catching this year, volunteers for 
the Smokeout say, because of the 
University of California system-wide 
smoking ban that was announced 
this January by the Office of the 
President. Students caught smoking 
within campus limits will face a steep 
fine, whose dollar amount has not 
yet been determined. Cigarettes are 
already unavailable for purchase on 
campus. Individual campuses have 
until January 2014 to implement the 
ban.

“UCSD is different,” Akemi 
Brown, event coordinator for Student 
Health Advocates said. “We’re push-
ing to enact the ban earlier, at the 
start of the 2013-14 academic year.”

The activities will focus on the 
different aspects of smoking, and will 
be interactive and spread throughout 
the expanse of Library Walk, as it has 
in recent years. 

Brown said the team of volunteers 
have decided to move away from 
the carnival-esque tone of last year’s 
event, in which participants were 
asked to participate in a bean bag 
toss and spin a ‘wheel of facts.’

“It was almost flippant last year. 
We don’t want it to be like that any-
more. We’ll have personal stories, 
artwork and dramatic visuals. We 
want people to come to the Library 
Walk exhibit and walk away shocked, 
or at least affected in a profound way.”

Nationally, Smokeout day organiz-
ers are encouraged by the American 
Cancer Society to provide guide-
books, information about smok-
ing cessation groups and nicotine 
replacement products for free. The 
booth will highlight the resources 
that are available to students seeking 
to quit, such as Nicotine Anonymous 
of La Jolla and the San Diego Smoke 
Stoppers. 

“These are things people just don’t 
know about, even if they smoke and 
want to quit,” Brown said. 

She cited a smoking cessation 
service offered by Student Health 
Services, that provides counseling, 
nicotine patches and gum — remark-
ably, at no cost to students.

At most events hosted by SHA 
volunteers on Library Walk in past 
years, the vast majority of passerby 
have been too busy to stop. 

“The success is in the couple of 
students who do,” Brown said. 

Brown said that pointing students 
in the direction of campus resources 

was only a part of the battle.
“We’re currently developing hand-

out materials for an action plan. We 
want students to do something con-
crete with the information — quit 
themselves, or more commonly, get 
someone they love to quit.” 

Ankur Chawla, a member of 
UCSD student organization Young 
Americans for Liberty, argued in a 
popular YouTube video, posted on 
May 22, 2010, when the ban was 
first proposed, that the smoking ban 
would be an infringement on student 
rights.

In the video, other unnamed 
members of YAL paraded down 
library walk holding posters that 
read, “Smoking is Healthier Than 
Fascism.”

“We’re not advocating smoking,” 
Chawla said. “We’re advocating the 
right to make your own choice. I per-
sonally have never smoked a cigarette 
in my life.” 

Brown said that smokers and 
smoking advocates failed to under-
stand the consequences of their 
actions. 

“They say it’s a personal choice. 
But it’s not. Many of us [volunteers] 
have or had family members who’ve 
smoked. We had asthma, aller-
gies, yellow fingernails growing up. 
Smoking affects others, and we want 
smokers to really understand that, 
this year.”

BALLROOM
The timeless camp of Reefer Madness is balanced 
by genuine mystery and absorbing drama in Iron Fist,

Introduced to the euphoric effects of morphine by a 
mysterious doctor, the couple soon becomes 
involved in a malevolent kidnapping plot while 
navigating a dark underworld of drug dens and 
forbidden pleasures. In this live performance and film 
screening, Tijuana-based electronica specialists 
Nortec Collective retool the soundtrack by blending 
traditional Mexican music with contemporary beats.

how much it will be for the room, it depends

Oakland, at some point people had 
already given up as far as education 
system was concerned,” Lopez said.

After setting up a TFA program 
in Oakland school district schools, 
the number of “red” schools, or 
schools deemed in particular need 
of assistance, went down from 42 
to six. Additionally, “blue” or high 
achieving schools, quadrupled.

Lopez said 
the program 
would employ 
methods used 
in San Diego’s 
Preuss School, 
a charter school 
on UCSD’s 
campus. The 
Preuss School 
enrolls low-
income stu-
dents between 
the sixth and 
twelfth grade, 
providing spe-
cialized coun-
seling to increase the likelihood that 
its students will be able to attend a 
quality university. It was ranked as 
the top transformative school by 
Newsweek and one of the top high 
schools in California by U.S. News 
and World Report; Lopez says can be 
attributed to the same kind of sup-
port that TFA will provide schools 
in the low-income areas around San 
Diego.  

In return, TFA members gain 
a great deal of job security. While 
the ASU report commented on the 
low retention of TFA members in 
the classroom, Lopez said an over-
whelming majority of TFA alumni 
stay in the education system, finding 

careers as education policy lawyers, 
superintendents in public school 
districts or developers of education 
technology.  

The program is highly exclu-
sive.; in 2011, the acceptance rate 
was 11 percent. According to the 
program’s website, TFA doesn’t seek 
a particular resumé, but are look-
ing especially for students with an 
excellent academic record, strong 
leadership experience and a demon-

strated interest in 
education issues.

“We’re looking 
for people that, 
for any reason, are 
passionate about 
the power of edu-
cation,” Lopez 
said.

Lopez said he 
looks for potential 
applicants who 
genuinely believe 
that a good teach-
er can make all the 
difference. That’s 
what made the 

difference for him.
“I was someone that grew up in 

a low income community. By the 
time I graduated from high school 
I didn’t fulfill the requirements in 
math and science I needed [to enter 
college],” Lopez said.

But Lopez was inspired by excel-
lent teachers that compelled him to 
work through his hardships con-
tinue his education. After 10 years, 
his persistence paid off.

“I ended up at UCSD and gradu-
ated with a Bachelor of Science in 
Management.”

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, OCTOBER 22,  2012 |  www.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 11

5th Annual Campus-wide 
Family Weekend
October 26 – 28, 2012

1,700+ Triton Families will be on campus 
to reconnect with their students and have FUN!

Visit parents.ucsd.edu or call 858-534-7273.

UCSD’s Acton, Diaz Sweep CCAA All-
Conference Freshman of  the Year Award

finished with a time of 26:27 and 
Flores carded 26:31. Acton, who 
has performed well for the Tritons 
in previous meets, won the CCAA 
Freshman of the Year award. 

“[Acton] has risen to the occa-
sion, he did a good job of follow-
ing the leadership of [Collins] this 
weekend, and fighting all the way 
through. He really helped us secure 
third place.”

The Tritons were just slighted 
for second place, as UCSD finished 
with an average time of 26:29.68, just 
three seconds slower and one point 
behind Humboldt State.

On the women’s side, UCSD’s 
top finishers were a pair of fresh-

man. Finishing ninth overall with a 
time of 22:22, Marie Diaz recorded 
a career best. The time is also the 
fastest for UCSD since 2010. Diaz 
improved a remarkable 37 seconds 
from the Triton Classic two weeks 
ago.

“[Diaz] has just been having 
a great season,” Garcia said. “It’s 
always a big transition for athletes 
to come out of high school, and she’s 
just handled the jump so well. To be 
in the top-10 in our conference as a 
freshman is just great for her.”

For her record-breaking perfor-
mance, Diaz was also awarded the 
Freshman of the Year award.

Freshman Carolina Guzman also 
had a strong performance, finishing 
second for UCSD with a time of 

23:01.0 and 20th overall. Junior Chia 
Chang — the program’s most consis-
tent runner — finished four-tenths 
of a second after Guzman.

As a team, UCSD finished fourth, 
with 115 total points and an average 
time of 23:02.72.

Both the men and women have 
two weeks to prepare for the NCAA 
Division II West Regionals, to be 
held at Hawaii Pacific at the Kahuku 
Golf Course on Saturday, Nov. 3.

The Triton men will compete in a 
10k race at 8 a.m., while the women’s 
6k race is set for 9 a.m. The top five 
teams from each gender will earn a 
ticket to the national competition.

On Sports and Body Image

are caught in a contradiction. Athletes 
are pressured to attain a muscular, lean 
and toned athletic form, as well as a 
body that is appropriately “feminine.” 

In other words, we need to be 
powerful and trim, but never “manly.” 
And that is nearly impossible. 
    The folks over at KidsHealth.org 
describe this pressure well when they 
explain the “Female Athlete Triad.” 
The triad is described as the health 
risks often associated with female 
athletes, which include negative 
body image and eating disorders. 
    “Many girls have concerns about 
the size and shape of their bodies,” 
the website reads. “But being a highly 
competitive athlete and participating 
in a sport that requires you to train 
extra hard can increase that worry... 
Even in sports where body size and 
shape aren’t as important, such as dis-
tance running and cross-country ski-
ing, girls may be pressured by team-
mates, parents, partners and coaches 
who mistakenly believe that ‘losing 
just a few pounds’ could improve their 
performance.”

It’s true. We’re an extremely body-
conscious bunch. 

I’ve heard female basketball players 
long to be a little bit taller, swimmers a 
little bit leaner, runners a little bit more 
toned. It’s hard to blame us, with our 
unforgiving uniforms and the scores 
of “perfect” athletic bodies we’re sur-
rounded by daily. 

But even the owners of those per-
fect bodies are not exempt from the 
struggle; perhaps the most wiry, mus-
cular, perfect runner I know confessed 
to me how much she wished she had 
my skin tone, since she felt hers was 
too pale to look good in uniform. 

I, on the other hand, had spent 
all season wishing that my backside 
was as lean as hers, as mine seems 
to cross the finish line a good three 

seconds after the rest of me does. 
    We’re a group obsessed with the 
newest protein supplement and fat-
loss diet in our quest for the physical 
perfection that we feel will ramp up 
our athletic performance. And it gets 
more serious than that — once in 
a blue moon, a rumor will circulate 
about how a woman quit collegiate 
competition because she succumbed 
to an eating disorder.

Yet along with this pressure to 
maintain an Adonis-esque level of 
muscle tone, female athletes are con-
fronted with the demands of a society 
that focuses on “femininity” — namely, 
being soft, curvy and delicate. In fact, 
male journalists have decried the loss 
of femininity at the hands of female 
athleticism. 

The Turkish columnist Yüksel 
Aytuğ, in his column titled 
“Womanhood is Dying at the 
Olympics,” lamented the loss of female 
“grace and naïveté,” stating, “Broad-
shouldered, flat-chested women with 
small hips are totally indistinguishable 
from men. Their breasts — the symbol 
of womanhood, motherhood — flat-
tened into stubs as they were seen as 
mere hindrances to speed.” 

And this isn’t just the opinion of some 
backwards-thinking misogynist; many 
of the comments on his article, includ-
ing those from American men and 
women, agreed with the author’s ideas. 
    As a result, female athletes are forced 
to struggle with body images that are 
completely opposite of each other: Not 
only are we supposed to look strong 
and sexy in a tight spandex uniform, 
we should also look stunning in a ball 
gown. 

For as long as athletic performance 
is considered inextricable from physi-
cal perfection and the notion of “femi-
ninity” implies softness, female athletes 
will always be caught in the middle, 
struggling to balance athletic power 
with socially-acceptable delicacy.

UCSD Hosts 
Championships

By RACHEL UDA

Taking back-to-back sweeps last weekend on the road, the Tritons have fought their 
way back into the national rank-
ings for the first time since the start 
of CCAA conference play. UCSD 
defeated two middle-of-the-pack 
conference opponents in CSU Los 
Angeles and CSU Dominguez Hills.  
On Friday, the Tritons faced CSU 
Los Angeles, sweeping the Golden 
Eagles in a solid performance that 
highlighted UCSD’s depth.

Against CSU Los Angeles, the 
Tritons had five players with six or 
more kills, while sophomore Amber 
Hawthorne and junior Brittany 
Lombardi recorded 10 and 12 digs, 
respectively.

“This was a big win for us in a 
tough place to play,” UCSD Head 
Coach Ricci Luyties said to the 
UCSD Athletics Department. “We 
didn’t hit with great efficiency, but 
we were well balanced.”

The Tritons set the tone with a 
dominant first set, taking the game 
with a score of 13-25. In much closer 
games, UCSD won the second set 
21-25 and the third set 26-24.

On Saturday, the Tritons won 
their fourth straight match against 
CSU Dominguez Hills (7-6). 

Freshman standout Danielle 
Dahle came back to the forefront 
against the Toros. The outside hit-
ter finished with another double-
double, leading UCSD in kills with 
16, while also recording 10 digs. 
Dahle — UCSD’s category leader in 
kills, with 290 on the season — has 
the third-highest kills per set in the 
conference. 

Sophomore middle blocker Sara 

McCutchan also had a strong game, 
recording 10 kills.

UCSD swept the Toros — a team 
that beat UCSD at the start of the 
2012 season — with scores of 21-25, 
20-25 and 21-25.

“It was nice to get a win against a 
team that beat us badly the first time 
we played,” Luyties said to the UCSD 
Athletics Department. “I think it 

shows how much we’ve improved.”
The Tritons seem to have stepped 

up to the learning curve in their 
past few matches, and will hope to 
continue to improve as they near 
postseason play.

Currently, UCSD (10-3) holds 
on to second place in the CCAA, 
behind CSU San Bernardino. The 
Tritons have nine more conference 

games until the post-season, and will 
return to RIMAC Arena for a match 
against Humboldt State this Friday, 
Oct. 26. 

On Saturday, UCSD faces off 
against Cal Poly Pomona, both 
matches will be held at 7 p.m.

After a promising showing at the Annual Triton Classic, the UCSD Men’s and Women’s Cross Country teams recorded 
lukewarm results at the CCAA Championships last 
Saturday, Oct. 20. The Triton men went their third 
straight year carding a third-place finish, while the 
women placed fourth amongst a field of 11 teams. 
    Conditions could not have been better for 
the conference championships, hosted by UCSD. 
The climate was cool from a drizzle that cov-
ered the North Campus Course during the 
duration of the men’s 8k race and women’s 6k. 
    “It wasn’t a perfect day for us, but we had 
some really strong performances out there,” 
UCSD Head Coach Nate Garcia said. “Our con-

ference is a real strong one this year, so it was a 
real good opportunity for us to test ourselves.” 
    As expected, Chico State won its fifth 
straight conference championship on both the 
men’s and women’s sides. Chico State finished 
1–2, with juniors Isaac Chavez and Alfonso 
Cisneros placing first and second respectively. 
    Sophomore Tanner Collins was UCSD’s top fin-
isher, placing 13th with a time of 26:16. The time 
was one second slower than his finish at the Triton 
Classic, hosted on Oct. 6.

Freshman Scott Acton and junior Mario Flores 
recorded the next fastest times for UCSD; Acton

Sitting in math class my sophomore 
year of high school, I was taking a 
break from staring off into space and 
doodling flowers in my notebook to 
write and pass a note to my friend, ask-
ing her if she wanted to go to the swim 
meet the next day. She read it and 
glanced up at me, eyes bright with that 
spark she’d get when she had some juicy 
gossip to share. She scribbled back. 
       “Did you hear that K’s quitting swim?” 

      Confused, I checked to make 
sure our teacher wasn’t watching 
before writing back. “What? Why?”  
    She was the best swimmer our 
school team had worked with in years; 
the coach was already planning her 
eventual Olympics appearances. Most 
students didn’t keep up with school 
sports, but everyone knew that she was 
going to be an elite athlete one day.

“Apparently her mom thinks her 
shoulders are getting too broad and 
that she’s starting to look like a boy.”

My brows furrowed, my reply sum-
ming up my only understanding of 
the matter.

“Wtf.”
Since high school, I’ve realized 

that instead of flourishing in an arena 
where women are judged on their abili-
ties and not their looks, female athletes
