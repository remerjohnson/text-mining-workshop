NEW DELHI, India - Hours 
after Pakistan's prime minister 
fired the powerful army chief on 
Tuesday afternoon, the army 
struck back with a swift, appar-
ently bloodless coup. 

Troops surrounded the prime 
minister's home, closed all the 
major airports and shut down the 
state-run television and radio sta-
tions for several hours. 

At 2:50 a.m. on Wednesday, the 
army chief, Gen. Pervaiz 
Musharraf, addressing the nation 
on state television in a tone of 
patriotic earnestness, said the mil-

LGBIA Addresses Diversity 
ACCEPTANCE: . 
National Coming Out 
Day celebrated Monday 
By EVlLYN FRANKS 
Guardian Reporter 

The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual 
and Transgender Association 
(LGBTA) held its annual open 
microphone event Monday, 
marking National Coming Out 
Day. The event took place in the 
Price Center at noon. 

National Coming Out Day 
provided an opportunity for 
both staff and students to share 
their experiences on a range of 
issues dealing with coming out 
of the closet, including society's 
attitudes toward gays, lesbians, 
bisexuals and transgenders and 
a desire to raise awareness and 
promote diversity within the 
community. 

Kari Berquist, a principal 
member of the LGBTA, said the 
event "provided visibility for 
an invisible community." 

After an introduction, the 
microphone was open to any-
one who wanted to address the 
audience. Speakers discussed 
their experiences in coming out, 
the stigma attached to homo-
sex uality in society and the 
need to embrace diversity in 
society. Speakers used the 
anniversary of the murder of 
the University of Wyoming stu-
dent Matthew Shepard to illus-
trate the stigma attached to 
matters of sexuality. 

Edwina Welch, director of 
the Cross Cultural Center, said 
that there is a need to embrace

Memorial Honors Paul Saltman 
REMEMBRANCE: Professor eulogized by family and former students 
By LEENA SHANKAR 
Senior Staff Writer 

A beautiful sunny day befit-
ted the "Celebration of Life" in 
memory of Paul Saltrnan, held 
Monday at Revelle Plaza . 
Nearly 400 students, faculty, 
staff and community members 
joined the Saltman family to 
share stories about the 

renowned biology professor 
who passed away on Aug. 27. 

Many students had inspira-
tional words to offer about 
Saitman and his impact on 
them personally. Karen Herbst, 
a student of Saltrnan's and also 
one of. his teaching assistants, 
said that he was like a father to 
her and to many others. 

"He always called us ' kids, '" 

Herbst said. "Not because he 
thought we were children but 
because I honestly believe he 
thought of us as his kids; he 
was like a father to us." 

Mauricio Dujowich, another 
of Saltman's students and 
teaching assistants, said that

Outreach 
Grant 
Awarded 
EDUCATION: Money 
will improve K-12 
student development 
By WINDER SEKHON 
Staff Writer 

The Federal Government 
awarded UCSD a $2 million grant 
to be used for a program called 
"Gaining Early Awareness and 
Readiness for Undergraduate 
Programs" (G.E.A.R. U.P.). 

The grant was awarded to the 
Center for Research and 
Educational Equity, As essment 
and Teaching Excellence 
(C.R.E.A.T.E.), in collaboration 
with the Office of ' Student 
Educational Advancement. 

C.R.E.A.T.E. was established 
in 1997 to increase the number of 
underrepresented students at 
UCSD and other similar universi-
ties by improving professional 
development in K-12 school s, 
increaSing parent involvement 
and improving health care in the 
K-12 environment. G.EAR. U.P. 
is based on educational research 
and proven practices to develop 
students' potential to achieve aca-
demically and plan for college. 

Bud Mehan, director of 
C.R.EAT.E., sa id that G.E.A.R. 
U.P. will have a significant impact 
on students. 

"Our G.E.A.R. U.P. project 
shows how K-12 education can 
benefit when the early academic 
outreach and professional devel-
opment components of our cam-
pus work together," Mehan said. 
"When academic counseling and 
academic tutoring go hand-in-
hand, students are better pre-
pared to attend college and make 
other important Life choices." 

The award will assist UCSD's 
G.E.A.R. U.P. project by support-

in~ and enhancing the universi-
ty s partnerships with Mann 
Middle School and Crawford 
High School in the San Diego 
Unified School District, and 
National City Middle School and 
Sweetwater High School in the 
Sweetwater Union High School

Study Rnd. Elections c;annot Be BOQght 
POUTlCS: UCSD professor states in book that money is not always the key to passing initiatives 
By MARIA CASTB.LANOS 
Guardian Reporter 

Money is not always a suc-
cessful tool for influencing out-
comes of elections, states UCSD 
political science Professor 
Elisabeth Gerber in a new book 
titled The Populist Paradox: 
'"tmst Group '""umet arut the 
Promise of Direct LtgislJltio". 

Many political observers have 

voiced their concerns over the 
excessive influence of wealthy 
groups on ballot initiatives due 
to their vast sums of money. But 
Gerber's study states that while 
large interest groups are not 
always able to "buy" elections, 
they are at times more successful 
by using direct legislation to 
exert pressure on politicians and 
to block initiatives that are being 
proposed by others. 

Gerber states that the citizen 
interest groups that have broad-
based support and vast organi-
zational resources are much 
more effective in using the initia-
tive process to pass new laws. 

The study, which includes 
extensive surveys of the activi-
ties and motivations of interest 
groups as well as campaign 
finance records from 168 direct 
legislation campaigns in eight 

states, concludes that only 31 
percent of initiatives backed by 
economic groups passed . 
However, 50 percent of the citi-
zen-supported initiatives passed . 

Gerber stated that organiza-
tions backed by a lot of money 
are unable to buy elections. 

"The Widely held perception 
that wealthy interests buy elec-

" Dr. Sa ltman said, 'Ma uricio, I

you are a big mess. Stick wi th me 
and you' ll blossom,'" Dujowich 
sa id. " He took ca re of everyone 
regardless of his physica l condi-

w as still asking me how I was 
doing and trying to get me to the 
next level." 

Francis Truong, who was also

sa id that the professor was on the 
students' level in every sense. He 
related a story about how 
Saltman once held an exam-grad-
ing session in tlte facul ty club 
with beer and wine for refresh-
ments. 

" Needless to say, we had a lot 
of regrades that year," Truong 
said. "There is only one word to 
reall y describe Dr. Saltman and 
that's ' friend .'" 

Chancellor Robert Dynes also 
spoke about Sallman and his 
impact on UCSD. 

" Most of us, all of us, will

Triton Taxi Program Keeps 
UCSD Students Safe 

The A.S. Council's Triton Taxi program began last 
weekend, offering students free rides home on week-
end nights. The shuttle, which runs from 9 p.m. to 3 
a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights, covers the areas 
of La Jolla, Pacific Beach, Mission 8ay, Clairemont, 
Uni versity City, Del Mar and Mira Mesa. The service 
is free for all undergraduate students with a Triton 
Tax i sticker on their UCSD 1.0. cards. 

The Guardian feels that the $8.000 program is an 
excellent use of student funds. It has been carefully 
researched by A. S. President Tesh Khullar and is mod-
eled after a similar program at UC Davis. We believe 
that the program provides students with an opportuni-
ty to act responsibly on the weekends rather than 
putting their li ves, and the li ves of others, in danger. 

While the A.S. Council is providing students with a 
free service, students do need to get a sticker for their 
1.0. cards if they wish to use the Tn ton Taxi. Last Friday 
night. 50 people called to use the service; however, all 
but four of those students were turned away because 
they did not have s ti cker~ on their 1.0. cards. Saturday 
night 's numbers were slightly bener: 12 students 
received rides home. Khullar said that the AS. Council 
will distribute stickers on Library Walk this week and 
next in an effort to encourage student participation. 

We congratulate the A.S. Council on a good job and 
hope students think ahead and get their stickers from 
the A.S. office before they drink a a weekend night. 

SDSU Students Will Study 
in Cuba in New Program 

San Diego State Uni versity has initiated a semes-
ter-long exchange program with the University of 
Havana in Cuba; this is the first time that a United 
States university has been able to provide a study-
abroad program in Cuba. Students can study a wide 
variety of topics ranging from economics to sociolo-
gy, all with a Cuban perspecti ve. Students from all 
majors can apply, but they must be fluent in Spanish. 

This program is an excellent step towards foster-
ing beller relati ons between the United States and 
Cuba. Though this advance does not indicate that 
Cuba is becoming more liberal. now, students can 
learn more about the country and its culture while 
sharing their own American backgrounds. Ignorance 
is a causal factor for the animosity that lingers 
between both nations; a uni versity exchange program 
will cultivate a new generation of leaders who are 
more educated lI bout Cubll and its ideals. 

Overall . the establishment of thi s program is long 
overdue. We hope that UCSD students, too, will 
soon be lIble to add Cuba to the long li st of countries 
that they can visit in study-abroad programs.

PARKING LOTS GONE? 
COMMENTARY: 
The construction of new 
parking structures cause 
parking shortages now 
By KEVIN SEiD 
Contributing Opinion Wflter 

Parking at UCSD has always been 
a nightmare. Every day, many stu-
dents wander the parking lots look-
ing for that rare empty spot. All of 
the parking spaces around the center 
of campus are gone before mid-
morning, and many students 
become angry and frustrated 
because they cannot find spaces 
located near their classes. 

The problem has been com-
pounded this year by the destruction 
of several lots to make way for new 
parking structures. 

Construction is currently under 
way on two multi-level parking 
structures in the North Parking and 
Gilman Drive lots. Many existing 
parking spaces were bulldozed to 
make wa y for the construction, 
despite the fac t that every new 
school year brings more students to 
UCSD and increases the demand for 
parking. 

A new 1,552-space parking lot 
west of Regents Road is currently 
being built to accommodate the cars 
displaced by the loss of these spaces. 
A portion of the lot has already been 
completed and the rest is scheduled 
to open by January. 

For many, this lot will be the only 
available option for parking The 
problem is that this lot is the farthest 
from the center of campus. Its loca-
tion is very inconvenient, no matter 
what the destination is of those who 
park there. 

Even getting to the Regents Road 
lot is inconvenient for a lot of com-
muters, especially those coming 
from the north or the south 
Interstate 5. The center of campus is 
to the west of the freeway; the park-
ing lo t is to the east. After com-
muters exit the freeway, they must 
then head in the opposite direction 

Parking should be one of the 
last things students have to 
worry about. Many of us 
experience enough stress 
just trying to deal with 
classes and midt~rms. 
to find parking - away from the 
center of campus. 

Those who travel from down-
town La Jolla via La Jolla Shores 
Drive or Torrey Pines Road must 
pass by the center of campus to get 
to the Regents Road lot. Students 
coming from the east communities 
such as Mira Mesa are in a better 
position, as they reach the lot as 
soon as they get on campus, but 
they still have the commute to their 
classes. 

The lot does not help anyone 
who lives in the area, either. A num-
ber of students live in apartment 
complexes located within a few 
blocks of the lot. For these people, 
parking in the Regents Road lot 
would be pointless. It hardly seems 
worth the effort when the drive to 
the parking lot is shorter than the 
shuttle trip to get to your lecture 
hall. 

Once students do park in the 
Regents Road lot, the only options to 
get to class are either to take the cam-
pus shuttle or to make the long hike. 
Both options present problems for 
students. 

The parking shuttle is the first 

choice for many, but this is often 
inconvenient and frustrating. Firstly, 
there is a considerable delay 
between shuttles, and secondly, the 
shuttles tend to fill up so quickly 
during peak hours that many stu-
dents are forced to wait for the next 
one. 

Of course, students can always 
hike from their cars to the Price 
Center. But few students would be 
willing to make this journey in the 
hot October sun while carrying a 
heavy load of books and c1ass.mate-
rials . Even if students do elect to hike 
to class from their cars, they might 
be too tired at the end of the day to 
walk back. 

Whether using the shuttle or trav-
eling on foot, it stiU takes a consider-
able amount of time to travel to and 
from the parking lot. This valuable 
time could be better spent studying 
rather than trekking back and forth 
across campus. 

Many students would prefer not 
to park in the Regents Road lot 
because of the considerable inconve-
niences that are associated with it. 
They would rather drive through the 
packed parking lots closer to their 
classes, waiting for rarking spots to 
open up. Some wil be tempted to 
park illegally and risk the prospect 
of a ticket. 

Parking should be one of the last 
things students have to worry about. 
Many of us experience enough stress 
just trying to deal with classes and 
midterms. 

Unfortunately, as construction 
continuCli on campus, even more 
students will have to park in the 
Regents Road lot. Even as the North 
Torrey Pines and Gilman parking 
structures are completed next fall, 
the remainder of the North Parking 
lot will be bulldozed to make way 
for the new site of Roosevelt col-
lege. 

With this construction, the com-
petition for parking will increase 
once again, and more students will 
be forced to endure the inconve-
niences of the Regents Road parking 
lot.

New Presidential Bid Don't Leif Me Out 
COMMENTARY: Editor to consider viability of running for president COMMENTARY: Columbus hogs Ericson's glory 

Senior Staff Writer 

Inspired by the extraordinary 
example set by Donald Trump 
and Warren Beatty, I've decided 
to investigate the possibility of 
running for preSident. Sure, I 
might not have the advantage of 
real-estate money or a 100-
megawatt smile, but I still think 
I have a chance. 

As editor of the Guardia", I 
have gathered some real leader-
ship experience. But that's not 
important. What is important is 
that I was elected editor. Unlike 
Warren Beatty, my election expe-
rience isn' t limited to an appear-
ance on the "Dobie Gillis Show." 

In addition, as a young 
woman, I just might be able to 
snag those all important youth 
and female votes. While Mr. 
Trump's experience with young 
females is limited to the models 
he has dated, I am a living, 
breathing, young person. I 
understand what people our 
age want. 

This is why, as president, my 
first act in office would be to sign 
an executive order eliminating 
college fees . My second act 
would be to sign an executive 
order making it illegal for presi-
dential candidates to get image 
makeovers halfway through the 
campaign season. Front runners 
AI Gore and George "don' t for-
get the W." Bush, seem to have 
switched personalities recently, 
confUSing the American public 
to no end. 

But let me get back to the 
point. Unfortunately, there are 
just not enough female candi-

dates to choose from right now. 
Although I admire Elizabeth 
Dole for sticking with a man 
who has gone from being 
Senate majority leader to the 
official spokesperson for 
Viagra, I just can't bring myself 
to vote for her. I don't want my 
future children to live in a 
world where school prayer is 
mandatory and the Ten 

The National Enquirer 
recently published a 
study concluding that the 
nation is clamoring for 
Donald Trump to enter 
the presidential race. 
Well, I figure that if 
people are so desperate 
for a quality presidential 
candidate that they'd 
consider voting for a 
womanizing casino 
owner, I've got to have a 
shot. 

Commandments are posted on 
the walls of their classrooms. In 
addition, Dole's ambiguous, 
'Tm pro-choice but can't admit 
it" abortion policy leaves me 
wondering what will happen 
when she gets into office. 
Luckily, I don' t have to worry 
about that because Dole has 
absolutely no chance of becom-
ing president. 

This is where I come in. As a 
presidential candidate, I would 
be somewhat more electable 
than Elizabeth Dole because I'm

to tell everyone what an impact

I realize that my campaign 
will most likely. be an uphill 
battle. I don't have vast 
resources of money like George 
W. Bush and AI Gore. My cam-
paign contributions can easily 
be counted in pennies and so 
far, my grandmother is my 
biggest supporter. In addition, 
unlike Gore, I have absolutely 
no international "support. " I'm 
afraid that any fund raisers I 
hold will take place at 
McDonalds, not at the Ritz. 

Nevertheless, I assure you 
that I am a serious candidate. 
The National Enquirer recently 
published a study concluding

idential race. Well, I figure that if 
people are so desperate for a 
quality presidential candidate

got to have a shot. 

In short, this is why I've 
decided to form an exploratory 
committee to determine my via-
bility as a presidential candidate. 
I strongly suspect that the com-
mittee, comprised of my grand-
mother and myself, will con-
clude that the presidency might 
not be a realistic option. 
However, if you 'd like to sup-
port me anyway, please send all

Il!tters@lIcsdgllard;all.o~"1 

By PETER BROWNFD.D 
Cavalier Daily (U. Virginia) 

(U,WIRE) CHARLOTTES-
VILLE, Va. - Everyone knows 
who Christopher Columbus is 
and why we honor him. He is cel-
ebrated for "discovering" the 
New World . But Columbus was 
about 500 years too late to get 
credit for this feat. 

The man we should be honor-
ing is Leif Ericson. His holiday 
was celebrated on Oct. 9, but just 
like every year, it came and went 
without any fanfare. No one has 
Leif Ericson parades, and few 
study Leif Ericson in school. In 
fact, the day is hardly marked on 
any calendars. Yet, Ericson beat 
out Columbus by nearly half a 
millennium. 

Ericson's accomrlishments 
have received offici a approval, 
and yet still many do not know 
who he is. In 1964, President 
Lyndon 8. Johnson, backed by a 
unanimous Congress, proclaimed 
Oct. 9 "Leif Ericson Day" in com-
memoration of the first arrival of 
a European on North American 
soil. 

In 1995, President Clinton 
wrote in a proclamation about the 
holiday, "Every October, we cele-
brate Leif Ericson Day and honor 
the memory of that great Norse 
explorer who first set foot on 
North American soil nearly a mil-
lennium ago. At a time when 
mankind has traveled from pole 
to pole and even journeyed into 
the vast reaches of space, Leif 
Ericson's bold determination 
stands as an early example of the 
spirit of adventure and enter-
prise." 

Ericson, a native of Iceland, 
landed in North America in the 
year 1000. He arrived in Canada, 
first landing on Baffin Island, 
which he called Helluland (Flat 
Rock Land), then Labrador, 
which he called Markland 
(Woodland), and finally 
Newfoundland, which he called 
Vinland (Wineland or 
Pastureland). 

Ericson and the other Icelandic 
Vikings stayed for the winter, 
leaving in 1001. Icelanders made 
other attempts to settle in North 
America, but failed due to friction 
with the native North Americans. 
The Vikings only made a few 
other trips to North America, and 
their discovery remained largely 
unknown to the rest of Europe for 
hundreds of years. 

Ericson's voyage is recorded in 
the Icelandic sagas, and is further 
backed by archaeological evi-
dence. There is little doubt that it 
occurred, and that it preceded 
Columbus' expedition by cen-
turies. 

The implications of Ericson's 
voyage could have been tremen-
dous. We could have been orient-
ed to Iceland and Scandinavia as 
our primary European connec-
tions, not England. Names like 
EgilI, Solveig and Sigurdur could 
have been more common than 
Bill, Kate or Tom. 

Jun Baldvin Hannibalsson, 
Ambassador of Iceland to 
America, recognized these impli-
cations, saying in a speech to an 
American audience in January, " If

Online Textbooks May End Up Harming Students LEIF: Ericson's discovery 
rivals Columbus' COMMENTARY: Online competitors may hurt students who need to buy books on campus 

By BRENT DON 
Opinion Editor 

If you look carefully around 
the UCSD campus and in recent 
issues of the Guardia/I, you' ll find 
several specimens of the latest 
pest to infest UCSD. I don' t mean 
the canyon rabbits (if you do find 
a rabbit in your copy of the paper 
please give it some Trix and send 
it on its way - it's probably ter-
ribly confused) . I'm talking 
about advertisements for online 
textbook stores. 

College students have always 
been subject to an inordinate 
amount of advertisements as 
manufacturers try to get their 
hooks into new potential cus-
tomers at a vulnerable stage in 
their lives; namely, when they 
first move out on their own and 
need to buy lots of stuff. 

Online textbook sellers are the 
latest players to join the clamor-
ing throng of pager, cellular 
phone, car insurance, shoe, 
clothing and computer compa-
nies already vying for students' 
attention. 

This time things are a little 
different, however. The new 
entrants to this market in many 
ways represent In unprecedent-
ed factor, companies that are 
competing with the university 
store - some would say monop-
oly - that generally has sup-
plied this vital product to stu-
dents: The UCSD Bookstore. 

The online textbook industry 
is still in its infancy, and needs to 
work out some important prob-
lems with their services - name-

Iy the hassle of customers having 
to wait for their books to be 
shipped and the unavailability of 
certain books - but as the indus-
try matures and these issues are 
resolved, they will start to pose 
more of a threat to campus book-
stores. 

Is it really in college students' 
best interest in the long term to 
get their textbooks from online 

The price per book would go 
up due to the lower margins plus 
the availability of books for 
classes (which is already frustrat-
ing for many students) would 
become even worse due to the 
bookstore's uncertainty of how 
many copies to stock. 

All of these problems will 
negatively impact students who, 
for whatever reasons, cannot get 

It's also important to remember that the university's 
bookstore is not the only business that would be 
affected. Groundwork Books, the General Store and 
the Book Co-op all stand to lose business to online 
companies. Students who work for these stores will 
certainly feel the effects of competition when it starts 
affecting their paychecks. 

sellers? The immediate benefits 
of purchasing from these stores 
certainly seem to be a boon for 
students; as reported in the arti-
cle "Buying Books Online" in the 
Oct. 4 issue of the Guardian, 
online textbook stores on aver-
age save UCSD students about 
12 percent compared to the 
Bookstore's prices. The long-
term impact of these companies' 
competition, however, is a little 

. less clear. 
Suppose that 'online resellers 

eventually come to constitute a 
major competitor to college 
bookstores, stealing a significant 
portion of business from them. 
The Bookstore will respond by 
stocking fewer copies of the texts 
for classes, which would lead to 
a host of problems. 

their books from online resellers. 
It's sometimes easy to forget that 
there are still a lot of people who 
do not have access to the 
Internet, even on college cam-
puses where computer labs are 
(ostensibly) available for all. 

It's also important to remem-
ber that the university's book-
store is not the only business that 
would be affected . Groundwork 
Books, the General Store and the 
Book Co-op all stdnd to lose 
business to online companies. 
Students who work for these 
stores will certainly feel the 
effects of competition when it 
starts affecting their paychecks. 

The best course for college 
bookstores to take is to treat the 
online textbook stores as true 
competitors. They cannot afford 

to dismiss them as fringe compa-
nies who pose no real threat to 
them. If the bookstores just rely 
on their location on campus to 
maintain control of the market, 
they will find themselves losing 
customers due to the unique fea-
tures of online stores: ease of use, 
lower prices and (in some 
instances) better availability. 

The Bookstore will have to 
make some concessions on 
account of the entrance of these 
new companies. This means they 
will have to cut prices to com-
pete with the online resellers. If 
they are smart, they will also 
look into implementing some of 
the ease of use that make online 
stores so appealing. If students 
can order their books from cam-
pus bookstores using a computer 
or telephone, easily placing 
orders for all their classes at 
once, and then either pick them 
up later or have them delivered 
without having to wait in line, 
they will eliminate one of the 
main advantages that online 
stores boast about. 

The entrance of the online 
textbook stores should foster 
some healthy competition in a 
market that has sorely needed 
it, so long as they truly become 
competitors and don't just take 
over the campus bookstore's 
role as textbook monopolist. 
Students have waited too long 
for options in purchasing text-
books just to flock to the 
Internet camp and realize that 
now they have a whole new set 
of problems.

u.s. Repeats Policy Mistakes of the Past 
COMMENTARY: U.S. me~dling in Colombia is motivated by economic reasons and hurts democratic movements 
By BEN WHEElER 
Columbia Daily Spectator 
(Columbia U.J 

(U-WIRE) NEW YORK 
When the United Nations 
Historical Clarification 
Commission concluded in March 
that the United States knowingly 
funded the Guatemalan genocide 
of the 19BOs, President Clinton 
traveled to Central America to 
make amends. 

"It is important that I state 
clearly that support for military 
forces or intelligence units which 
engaged in violent and wide-
spread repression of the kind 
described in the report was 
wrong," President Clinton said 
on March 11, addressing the 
Guatemalan legislature. "And the 
United States must not repeat 
that mistake." 

Today, U.S. policy toward the 
South American nation of 
Colombia looks an awful lot like 
our policy toward Guatemala, 
and EI Salvador as well, in the 
early BOs. We are increasing mili-
tary aid to a brutal army that, in 
turn, funds a network of even 
more brutal paramilitary groups.

In a private letter, Colonel J. C.

that "40 percent of the money the 
United States makes in interna-
tional trade is with Latin 
America, and we get more oil 
from Venezuela [a Colombian 
border country] than we do from 
the mideast now. Better think 
about the U.s. economic interests 
in the future before you propose 
we let the guerrillas take over." 

Oil companies are putting 
pressure for a lucrative invest-
ment environment in Colombia 
- current use of Colombia's vast 
oil and mineral resources must be 
protected by the military, and 
much potential drilling land is 
held by rebels. 

A movement arose in the '80s 
that Of posed U.S funding for 
Centra American militaries in 
that attacked their own people. 

Then, the Reagan administra-
tion justified this military support 
as necessary to the defense of 
democracy against the Soviet 
Union. 

As with Vietnam, we 'now 
know that the supposedly noble 
intentions of the United States 
were fraudulent - that our gov-
ernment instead sought econom-
ic security at an indefensible 
brutal cost. We know that we 
were wrong . But this means 
nothing if we refuse to take the 
responsibility to oppose our 
government today when the 
same half-truths are beinp' told 
and the same people are beirg

"We are determined to remem-
ber the past," Clinton said, "but 
never repeat it."

France Recognize. 'Pacts' Between 
Unmarried· Couples, Including Homosexuals 

PARIS The French 
Parliament passed a new law 
Wednesday giving legal status to 
unmarried couples, including 
homosexuals. 

The decision came nearly two 
years after the Socialist govern-
ment proposed the law, touching 
off protests by conservatives and 
the Catholic Church. 

The law allows couples, 
whether they are of the same sex 
or not, to enter into a union <lnd 
be entitled to the S<lme rights as 
married couples in such areas as 
income tax, inheritance, housing 
and social welfare. 

The legal unions, or "civil sol-
idarity pacts," known here by 
the acronym PACS, stem from a 
promise that Prime Minister 
Lionel Jospin made to recognize 
gay unions. 

But during the idea's gesta-
tion, it grew to includ.e virtually 
any two people sharing a home, 
be it brother and sister or even a 
priest and his housekeeper. 

The government has bent 
over backwards to say that 
PACS are not marriages but a 
new form of legal coupling that 
recognizes the needs of people 
today. 

In defending the new statute, 
the justice minister, Elizabeth 

Conservatives and the 
Catholic Church have 
denounced the 
legislation as an assault 
on the family. an attack 
on the moral fabric of 
society and a license for 
debauchery. Debates 
over the bill were among 
the stormiest the country 
has seen as 
impassioned legislators 
railed at each other. 
Guigou, said the law would 
force "the retreat of homopho-
bia" and offer "a solution to the 
5 million couples who live 
together without being mar-
ried." 

The law passed . in the 
National Assembly by a vote of 
315-249. But conservative law-
makers, who several times 
delayed the passage of the bill, 
immediately said they would 
ask the Constitutional Council to 
deCIde whether the law is 
unconstitutional, in which case it 
would become void . 

The new law makes France 

the first traditionally Catholic 
nation to re<:ognize homosexual 
unions. But even as the law pro-
ceeded through its last debate, 
protesters staged a noisy 
demonstration outside the 

ational Assembly. 
Conservatives and the 

Catholic Church have 
denounced the legislation as an 
assault on the family, an attack 
on the moral fabric of society 
and a license for debauchery. 
Debates over the bill were 
among the stormiest the country 
has seen as impassioned legisla-
tors railed at each other. 

Supporters say the bill will 
help not only gay couples, but 
young couples and older people 
and relatives, who want to live 
together and pool their 
resources. "Voulez-vous PACS-
er avec moi?" became a hot joke 
here for a while. 

Among the provisions in the 
law, employers will have to take 
couples' joint vacation plans into 
account. Partners will be able to 
help foreign partners enter the 
country and each partner will 
become liable for the other 's 
debts.

PAKISTAN: 
No public protest 
made against coup 

Nawaz Sharif and his government 
to stop any further politicization 
or destabilizution of the military. 
The general offered no timetable 
for elections, nor did he say 
whether he would rule personally 
or whether the army would install 
a caretaker government. 

He was apparently referring to 
Sharif's efforts to strengthen his 
hold over the courts and the mili-
tary, and to his success at pushing 
through a constitutional amend-
ment that had ended a president's 
power to dismiss an elected 
prime minister - a vestige of mil-
itary rule. 

"Despite all my advice," said 
the general, neatly attired in a 
camouflage uniform and wire-
rimmed glasses, "they tried to 
interfere with the armed forces, 
the last remaining viable institu-
tion in which all of you take so 
much pride and look up to at all 
times for stability, unity and 
integrity of our beloved coun-
try." 

In Pakistan, where generals 
have ruled for almost half its 52 
years as an independent nation, 
Sharif 's sudden, unexplained 
decision to fire the army chief 
was risky and came only a year 

NEWS 9 

after he had replaced another 
army chief who had sought a 
greater role for the army in run-
ning the country. 

There was virtually no public 
protest against the coup and 
some processions celebrated 
Sharif's demise, including one 
near Parliament House in 
Islamabad. Sharif, whose party 
won a landslide victory in 
February 1997, had become 
increasingly unpopular in recent 
months because of the country's 
deteriorating economy and out-
of-control sectarian violence, as 
well as Sharif's handling of a cri-
sis with India over Kashmir. 

The military takeover is likely 
to have serious international reper-
cussions for economically troubled 
Pakistan, which is desperately in 
need of assistance from interna-
tionallenders. A State Department 
spokesman said that if a coup was 
confirmed, the United States 
would call for the earliest possible 
restoration of democracy and 
would not carry on "business as 
usual" with Pakistan. 

India, too, voiced "grave con-
cern" about the coup and placed 
its military on high alert along the 
border it shares with Pakistan. 
Pakistan and India, both nuclear 
powers, have fought three wars 
and edged close to a fourth con-
flict this summer over the disput-
ed territory of Kash",ir.

Senate Rejects Nuclear Test 
Ban Treaty 51-48 

AFL-CIO Endorses AI Gore 
WASHINGTON - The Senate 

on Wednesday rejectE!d a treaty 
banning all underground nuclear 
testing in a 51-48 vote that 
crushed one of the major arms 
initiatives of the Clinton adminis-
tration. 

The vote on the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, 
largely along party lines, fol-
lowed a weeklong power play 
among Senate Republicans, 
Democrats and the White House 
to forestall the defeat of the treaty 
by dela)ling action until after 
President Clinton leaves office. 

In a last-ditch effort to save the 
treaty, Clinton called the 
Republican leader, Trent Lott, two 
hours before the vote and asked 
that he delay action for national 
security reasons. In a blunt rebuff, 
Lott told the president that what 
he offered was too little, too late, 
and he pushed ahead with an 
action he knew would humiliate 
Clinton. 

The vote marked the first time 

SMOKING: 
Statement marks 
shift in stance 

unveiled Tuesday as part of a 
$100 million corporate image 
campaign, the company unequiv-
ocally states there is an "over-
whelming medical and scientific 
consensus that cigarette smoking 
causes" diseases including lung 
cancer, emphysema and heart 
disease. 

It also states that smoking "is 
addictive as that term is most 
commonly used today." 

Philip Morris' move is part of 
a trend among tobacco producers 
to try to put health-related issues 
behind them, after agreeing in 
the last two years to pay $246 bil-
lion to settle lawsuits brought by 
states seeking to recover their 
Medicaid costs for treating ill 
smokers. 

that the Senate 'defeated a major 
international security pact since 
the Treaty of Versailles, creating 
tt,. League of Nittions, failed to 
win Senate approval in 1920. 
While the Senate and White 
House often joust on legislation 
governing domestic issues, in 
matters of national security sena-
tors of both parties have usually 
deferred to the president. 

The failure of the treaty to 
clear the Senate raised serious 
questions about its survival. 
Supporters ot the treaty, in 
Washington and abroad, had 
argued that if it was not adopted 
by the United States, other 
nuclear nations, ranging from 
Pakistan and India to Russia and 
China, would follow suit, deny-
ing the 1996 treaty the 44 ratifica-
tions it needs to go into force. The 
leaders of Britain, France and 
Germany had urged the Senate to 
postpone the vote. .

TIle New York Times 

By making more disclosures 
about smoking risks, producers 
also want to make it harder for 
those who start smoking now to 
sue by claiming they were 
unaware of the dangers . 

Brown &: Williamson 
Tobacco Co. created a web site 
with information on health 
issues last year, and R.J . 
Reynolds Tobacco Co. is in the 
process of doing so. 

Several anti-smoking advo-
cates who were read the new 
statements by Philip Morris said 
the statements were a marked 
shift for the company, particular-
ly in the area of smoking ~nd 
health. 

Previously, the company had 
contended, for example, that 
smoking was a "risk factor" or a 
"causal factor" in diseases like 
lung cancer, not that it caused the 
diseases.

LOS ANGELES - Winning 
the biggest prize so far in the 
presidential campaign, Vice 
President AI Gore on 
Wednesday gained the AFL-
ClO's endorsement and vowed 
to battle for working families, 
although labor leaders urged 
him to work harder to win the 
hearts and minds of union mem-
bers. 

The endorsement came with-
out the support of two of the 
nation's most powerful unions, 
the International Brotherhood of 
Teamsters and the United Auto 
Workers, and only after Gore 
had met privately this weeK with 
several union leaders and 
promised more attention to their 
concerns, like job losses caused 
by trade. 

After an extended entrance to 
the jaunty beat of blaring salsa 
music, Gore thanked the AFL-
ClO convention here for its sup-
port and spoke to the heart of 
the argument that had prevailed 
earlier in the debate whether to 
endorse now or later. 

'The work of labor is to lead 

and not to follow," the vice pres-
ioent said. The endorsement was 
made by voice vote among 700 
delegates representing the labor 
federation's 13 million union 
members. 

The AFL-CIO endorsement is 
a boon to candidates because the 
federation includes 68 unions, 
prints millions of leaflets and, 
perhaps better than any other 
group in society, can mobilize 
tens of thousands of volunteers 
for phone banks, registration 
drives and get-out-the-vote dri-
ves. 

Former Sen. Bill Bradley, 
Gore's rival for the Democratic 
nomination, conceded in an 
interview Wednesday that he 
did not believe he himself 
could win the endorsement of 
the autoworkers or the 
Teamst~rs, but he added, "1 
think it's a significant gap in 
[Gore's) support given the size 
of both unions." 

Gore's speech Wednesday to 
the organization underlined 
many of the commitments that 
he made in private meetings 

with union leaders in the last 
few days. With regard to one of 
labor's most pressing issues, 
Gore pledged that any agree-
ments he negotiated to expand 
trade would not undercut 
American workers. 

"Our president needs the 
authority to reach new trade 
agreements to open new markets 
to our goods and services," he 
said . " But as presiden~ I will 
also insist on the authbrity to 
enforce worker rights, human 
rights and environmental protec-
tions in those agreements. Trade 
should lift up living standards 
around the world, not drag them 
down in the United States." 

He also indicated that he 
would take to heart union lead-
ers' advice that he should meet 
personally with members of 
local unions across the nation. 
The Teamsters president, James 
P. Hoffa, told Gore's campaign 
manager, Tony Coelho, that Gore 
could not win the Teamsters 
support without doing so.

Scientists Develop A Mouse That 
Will Resist Some Cancers 

In a striking demonstration 
of the reach of a new anticancer 
technique, scientists have devel-
oped a strain of mouse that is 
immune to certain types of can-
cer, surviving injections of 
malignant cells that quickly 
raise lethal tumors in normal 
mice. 

The technique is based on 
the idea of starving tumors by 
cutting off their blood supply. 
Several compounds that inhibit 
the formation of new blood ves-
sels - a process called angio-
genesis - are at various stages 
of testing and mayor may not 
prove clinically useful. 

The new strain of mice, 
which is genetically incapable of 
making many new blood ves-
sels, shows how effective an 

anti-angiogenesis therapy might 
be if someone could develop a 
drug that worked as well in peo-
ple as the genetic manipulation 
does in mice. 

A team led by scientists at 
the Memorial Sloan-Kettering 
Cancer Center in New York 
developed the mice by deleting 
two genes that appear to con-
trol the process of angiogenesis. 
Their work is described in the 
issue of the journal Nnlllre that 
is being published today. 

Experts on angiogenesis said 
that the new finding would help 
explain the genetic mechanisms 
that underlie the formation of 
new blood vessels, and that dis-
covery of these mechanisms 
would provide a new set of tar-
gets against which anti-angio-

genesis drugs could be devel-
oped. 

Directing drugs against 
blood vessels rather than the 
tumor itself is regarded as par-
ticularly promising because 
cancer cells, being genetically 
unstable, can quickly develop 
resistance to a drug. But new 
blood vessels, which are com- -
posed of the body's normal 
cells, cannot. 

"It's very compelling and 
exciting work," said David A. 
Cheresh of the Scripps Research 
Institute in San Diego. "It gives 
you a gold mine of potential tar-
gets."

Professor Uses Electric Neuron 
RESEARCH: Cell made from $7.50 worth of equipment from Radio Shack 
By LAUREN I. COARTNEY 
Guardian Reporter 

In a recent study,' UCSD 
physics Professor Henry 
Arbarbanel created an electronic 
neuron and used it to perform 
an ordinary neurological func-
tion in a California Spiny 
Lobster. 

The electronic neuron, once 
successfully linked within its 
central fattern generator com-
posed 0 14 neurons, upheld the 
normal function of passing food 
from the lobster 's stomach to its 
digestive system. 

Even though Arbarbanel has 
referred to the significant accom-
plishment as "science fiction," 
he sa id that the experiment 
taught him and his fellow 
researchers an important biolog-
ical lesson about how neurons 
communicate and work with 
each other to perform functions 
such as repairing damaged tis-
sue. 

The results of the study may 
lead to the development of the 
ability to res tore brain functions 
to patients suffering from neuro-
logica I dysfunctions such as 
strokes and Alzheimer 's disease. 

Arbarbanel and his col-
leagu.es, Misha Rabinovich of 
UCSD's Institute for Nonlinea r 
Science and Allen Selverston, 
professor emeritus of biology, 
focused on the digestive system 
of the lobs ter. The lobs ter 's 

digestive system was an appro-
priate subject because it is a com-
plicated neurological system in 
an animal that has been well 
studied . 

The two-year experiment 
required only $7.50 worth of 
electrical parts purchased from 
Radio Shack and a dozen lob-
sters obtained from a local fish-

-IIenry ArtIeItIMeI 
UCSD physics professor 

To create an electronic neu-
ron, first the scientists needed to 
have considerable knowledge of 
biological neurons. They worked 
with biologists to study and 
understand the natural neurons 
they would recreate with simple 
ci rcuitry. They used this knowl-
edge to create complicated 
mathematical models using 
computers. The models proved 
to be too' complicated; 
Arbarbanel said that the simplic-
ity of what actually worked was 
surprising to him. 

"We kept reducing the num-

• 
r 

ber of variables we were usin~ 
until we were down to three, ' 
Arbarbanel said. 

Rob Elson, a neuroscience 
researcher, stated that reducing 
the variables down to a more 
simple experiment proved to be 
effective. 

"It's a higher level of model-
ing where you capture the per-
formance according to the model 
involving a few variables, and 
you're not concerned directly 
with all the small cogs working 
behind the scenes," Elson stated . 

After realizing that they only 
had to manipulate a few vari-
ables involving the speed and 
flow of the neurons, the scien-
tists were able to create a simple 
electrical neuron, the first ever to 
function normally among natur-
al neurons. Then they removed 
vital biological neurons from the 
natural circuit to create an 
abnormal flow of neurons, and 
replaced it with the electronic 
version. 

Arabarbanel said that this is 
only the first step; scientists will 
continue to move forward with 
the experiment until it can help 
humans .. 

"The ultimate goal is to 
replace all of the 14 neurons with 
electronic versions," Arbarbanel 
said . " If this can be successfully 
completed, it could be instru-
mental in repairing human tis-
sue and could seriously impact 
spinal cord research.n

sure state legisla-
tors ". the threa t of 
initiatives, howev-
er, seems to be a 
tool of both 
wealthy economic 
groups and broad-
based citizen 
groups, since legis-
lation in initiative 
states sometimes 
more closely 
reflects the inter-
ests of economic 
groups, and some-
times more closely lizing people, 

which makes it much easier for 
them to support and pass initia-
tives. 

Interest groups have power 
that goes beyond passing and 
blocking initiatives, Gerber stat-
ed. 

The direct initiative is one of 
four types of direct legislation. It 
is the most commonly used. espe-
cially in states such as California, 
where many political issues of 
the last decade have been decid-
ed through the initiative process. 
In other states it is used with 
varying frequency and regarding 
different issues. 

She added that the initiative 
p~ AI1lects a true democracy. 
i110Wfitg large numbers of people 
to participate. 

"The direct initiative - in 
which an interes t group drafts a 
proposition and qualifies it for 

interests of citizen reflects the 
groups." 

Gerber wrote in her book that 
critics are not always accurate in 
assessing the influence of 
wealthy groups. 

"Certainly, the role and influ-
ence of economic interest groups 
is different from what modern 
critics charge," Gerber stated . 
"Economic groups are limited in 
their ability to achieve direct 
influence over policy, especially 
direct modifying influence. At 
the same time. however, direct 
legislation provides them with 
additional means for influencing 
policy in more subtle ways." 

Gerber is approaching com-
pJetion with colleagues at UCSD 
on a major study for the Public 
Policy Institute of California on 
how the legislature implements 
voter initiatives .

GRANT: 
Goal is to prepare 
students for college 
ContInued from ..... 1 
District. 

The goal of G.E.A .R. U.P. is to 
motivate and equip disadvan-
taged students with the knowl-
edge and skills they !)eed in order 
to attend college and succeed 
there. G.E.A.R. U.P. reaches out to 
students in the seventh through 
twelfth grades. 

President Clinton sa id at a 
recent news conference that the 
program gives valuable help to 
young people. 

"These programs make all the 
difference in whether a young 
person goes to college," Clinton 
aid. "The e innovative programs 

start early reaching out to stu-
dents no later than seventh grade, 
staying with them all the way -
from providing students with 
mentors who encourage them to 
have high hopes and high expec-
tations for themselves, to ensur-
ing that chools teach the classes 
that prepare young people for 
college entrance exa ms, to help-
ing families figure out how to pay 
for college." 

The G.E.A.R. U.P. project 
includes activities designed to 
motivate and inspire jtudents to 
attend college in order to have 
the career of their choice. These 
activities include trips to' muse-
ums, laboratories, cultural events 
and local businesses. An impor-
tant purpose of these educational 
trips i to expose s tudents to the 
va rie ty of ca reers that requi re col-
lege degrees. 

The G.E.A .R. U.P. project also 
involves o ther program~ and 
activi ties that will keep s tudents 
on the track to college. The pro-
ject supports a community-based 
mentoring program, for example, 
in which volunteers from local 
businesses will act as mentors to 
s tudents. There will also be 
Sa turday academies focusing on 

math, science and computer 
skills, a broad range of after-
school activities, trips to college 
fairs, as well as tours of local uni-
versities. 

G.E.A.R. U.P. will incorporate 
the resources of the Student 
Opportunity and Access Program 
Consortium (Cal-S.O.A.P.). Cal-
S.O.A.P. represents the collabora-
tions among higher education 
institutions and large school dis-
tricts in San Diego County. 

Through Cal-S.O.A.P., 
G.E.A. R. U.P. has employed grad-
uate s tudents from San Diego 

"Students first begin to 
benefit from G.E.A.R. 
U.P. early in their pre-
college education during 
the seventh grade, which 
places them on the right 
track to attending and 
succeeding in college." 

-Cristina Ar"le 
G.E.A.R. U.P. coordinator 

State University who will work as 
counseling interns as part of the ir 
work-experience requirement for 
a master's degree in counseling. 

Keenan Giles, a graduate s tu-
dent employed as G.E.A.R. U.P. 
student program coordinato r at 
Mann Middle School, said he 
believes that a lack of knowledge 
and academic performance are 
significant reasons why students 
do not attend college. 

Giles sa id that the program at 
Mann Middle School will provide 
s tudents with basic information 
about the higher ed ucation sys-
tem, along with counseling ser-
vices and after-school activities. 

"The G.E.A.R. U.P. award will 
increase the academic achieve-
ment level among students with 
them keeping in mind that they 
have the capability and the 
resourtes to attend college," Giles 
said . 

Thursday, October 14. 1999 

Giles also said that the 
G.E.A.R. U.P. project is unique 
because it reaches out to all stu-
dents in the seventh grade 
regardless of grade point average 
or family income. 

"We're not focusing on a par-
ticular population unlike other 
programs; our concern is with the 
achievement level of the entire 
class," Giles said. 

Cristina Areola, a G.E.A.R. 
U.P. coordinator at National City 
Middle School, said that G.E.A.R. 
U.P. will be a successful project 
because it reaches out to students 
during the seventh grade, expos-
ing them at an early age to career 
opportunities and preparing 
them for college as early as possi-
ble. 

"If s tudents don't do well in 
middle school, it's likely they 
won't do well in high school or 
later in college," Areola sa id . 
"Students first begin to benefit 
from G.E.A.R. U.P. early in their 
pre-college education during the 
seventh grade, which places them 
on the right track to attending 
and succeeding in college." 

To encourage the participation 
of girls in G.E.A.R. U.P., the Girl 
Scouts have organized a program 
called "Girls are Great," which 
will take place as an after-school 
event. The aim of "Girls are 
Great" is to boost self esteem, cre-
ative problem solving, communi-
ca tion skill s and to crea te an 
awarenes among girls of the 
ca reer opportunities available to 
them . This program will attempt 
to counter the lack of s upport that 
exists in some cultures for girls to 
achieve academically and pursue 
career goals. 

In addition to its focus on s tu-
dents, the project also reaches 
out to parents through its family 
involvement training, which 
provides information about col-
lege costs and requirements and 
the availability of scholarship 
money. The project also helps 
them to gain the knowledge 
needed to support dlildren in 
rigorous curricula .

PROVO, Utah - The Dead 
Sea Scrolls database, which The 
Center for the Preservation of 
Ancient Religious Texts 
(CPART) has spent yea rs work-
ing on, will be published in 
compact disc form in mid -
October. The database is an elec-

the Dead Sea Scrolls. It will be 
available on an international 
level, said Daniel C. Peterson, 
director of CPART. CPART pro-
duced the non-Biblical part of 
the Dead Sea Scrolls because the 
Biblical scrolls are similar to the 
ones in use, and the collection of 
the scrolls is large, Peterson 
said . 

The Dead Sea Scrolls were 
discovered in clay jars in a cave 
near the Dead Sea shoreline by 
bedouin shepherds in 1847. The 
Scrolls are said to date back to 
the Second Temple period , 
which is twice as old as the 
medieval manuscripts that have 
been used for modern day 
Biblical texts.

HIATUS 15 

Fame Lives 
on at the 

Civic Center 
The classic musical of talented 
high school students comes to 

San Diego through October 17th 

I t's rare that a medium, such as theater, can recraft a movie like "Fame," and make it its own, unique and creative. But that is exactly what "Fame - The Musi-
cal" has accomplished . 

Fifteen years after Metro Goldwyn and 
Meyer (MGM) released the movie "Fame," 
comes "Fame - The Musica!," a theatrical 
event that shines with young talent. 

Some may remember "Fame" not from its 
movie success, which included four Acade-
my Award nominations, but from the suc-
cessful television show, starring Janet Jack-
son and Debbie Allen. Others know "Fa me" 
from its theme song: "Faaaame! I'm gonna 
live forever!" 

Now don't get me wrong, "Fame - The 
Musical" is not of an entirely new cut of clay. 
The premise, the characters and even some of 
the songs are directly pulled from the movie. 
However, there is a new passion that can 
only be felt from the stage version. 

Set in the '80s, "Fame - The Musical" 
highlights the hopes, dreams and aspirations 
of a diverse group of students attending the 
High School of Performing Arts in New York 
City; The school is now named the Fiorello La 
Guardia High School of Music and Art and 
Performing Arts and boasts alumni such as 
Al Pacino, Billie Dee Williams, Susan Vega, 
Eartha Kit and Liza Minelli . 

One of the greatest aspects of "Fame -
The Musical" is its unbelievably talented 
cast. Unlike many of the students in the 
movie, the lead actors in "Fame - The Musi-
cal" are multi-talented, some having mas-
tered singing, dancing, an instrument and 
both dramatic and comedic acting. A few of 
the actors, such as Carl Tramon, who plays 
Schlomo Metzenbaum, are regular one-man 
shows. 

The cast is so talented that often there 
seems to be more talent on the stage than can 
possibly be used in one act. Occasionally, the 
overcrowded stage is distracting, but the 
energy created is unreal. The audience was 
elated, like children at their first circus. 

The most refreshing part of the mus,ical is

Fincher's 'Fight Club' Breaks the Skin 
Norton, Pitt and Carter deliver knock-out performances in the first round of the fall movie lineup 
By WALT DICKINSON 
Hiatus Editor 

Jack is sick of his life. So sick, 
in fact , he has taken to attending 
s upport groups for people with 
life-threatening illnesses. Mon-
day is over-eaters, Tuesday is 
tuberculosis, Wednesday is testic-
ular cancer. Jack is healthy, but if 
he doesn' t go to the meetings, he 
ca n' t sleep. 

That's when Jack meets Marla. 
Marla, like Jack, is a faker. She 
s uffers from a s imilar desponden-
cy about the world and finds 
solace in the glow of the uffering 
and dying. She even attends the 
tes ticular cancer meetings. Unfor-
tunately, her presence is a distrac-
tion for Jack, and once again he 
ca n' t sleep. 

That's when Jack meets Tyler. 
Tyler makes soap, and he has a 
phi losophy: Ty ler believes that 
the things yo u own end up own-
ing you. He believes that you're 
no t your job o r your possessions 
or your khakis . Tyler thinks that 
it's only after you've los t every-
th ing that you' re free to do any-
thing. 

And he wants Jack to hit him, 
as hard as he can. 

Together, Jack and Tyler start 
Fight Club, a private group of 
young urban males who take 
turns beating the living hell out of 
each other. It isn't about taking 
out one's aggressions or winning 
and lOSing. As Jack says, "When 
the fight is over, nothing is solved 
but nothing mattered ." 

MerrICk Mortcn/Coinely of 20ItI Cenfwy Fox 
..... Joe -= Brad Pitt (left) and Edward Norton meet for the first time and start smacking each other around in "Aght Club." 

As the popularity of Fight begins to question his friend's 
Club grows, Tyler begins to steer intentions. In time, Jack discovers 
the organization toward more that the new life he's been long-
militant objectives. The more ing for has arrived, but he finds 
extreme it gets, the more Jack he is powerless to stop its pro-

g~ion. 
Twentieth Century Fox's

Helena Bonham Carter (Marla) in 

excellently cast and brilliantly 
performed roles. Director David

Album Reviews 

... 
Moke 

--
-*** 

Guitar-heavy and mildly 
provocative, Moke's self-titled 
album splashes through lieveral 
different styles but ultimately 
blends into an already well-trav-
eled sonic highway. Fortunately, 
the group is brave enough to 
experiment with instruments (the 
violin on "In Your Dreams") and 
vocals, sometimes switching from 
breathy ballads to rapid-fire 
retorts, even during the same 
song (" Another Weekend"). 

Moke opened for The Black 
Crowes this summer, and it is 
obvious that they stayed around 
after their set. 

The best tracks ("Another 
Weekend," "In Your Dreams") 
owe a great debt to The Crowes, 
as well as other classic-rock fix-
tures such as Led Zeppelin and 
the Allman Brothers. Other tracks 
seem to be a mix of several mod-
ern styles - the Rage-like lyriCism 
on "Power Cut," for example -
that come off flat, victimized by 
average songwriting. 

Despite the publicist's claim 
that Moke makes cutting-edge 
rock, the truth is it has all been 
done before. From the bluesy 
vocals all the way to the "hidden 
track" gracing the final five min-
utes, Moke is guilty of a mediocre 
debut.

v.rIoII. ArtIeta 
American Beauty (Soundtrack) 
--
-** 

An eclectic collection of artists 
ranging from indie-rock bands 
such as The Folk Implosion to 
classic Bobby Darin have been 
compiled into one "mellow" 
groove. Thomas Newman's lucid 
instrumentals both begin and end 
the album's sleepy mood . Further 
along, the soundtrack borders on 
stagnancy until the fou rth track 
where Free's "All Right Now" 
seem to bring a pulse to the gen-

eral beat. The dreary attitude con-
tinues, however, through Eel's 
"Cancer for the Cure" and Peggy 
Lee's "Bali Ha'i" as the album 
fails to put any energy into its 
repertoire of songs. 

There is nothing particularly 
wrong with each individual track. 
Music icons such as The Who 
playing "The Seeker" are speck-
led throughout the album and 
bring about their familiar flavor. 
And the pace of the CD is not lan-
guid enough to cause depression. 
The characteristic steady rhythm 
and acoustic accent of American 
Beauty offer a perfe .. t compliment 
to sitting in a trendy cofff!e shop 
(trying not to be trendy) and sip-
ping $10 coffee. 

However, the soundtrack as a 
whole does not have the strength 
to stand out on its own like the 
soundtrack for "Trainspotting." 
There are definite elements miss-
ing in the soundtrack, primarily 
the movie or something else to go 
along with the background noise. 
There is nothing about the album

So unless the movie moved you 
enough to buy a momento for

will just leave a "blah" taste in

Man or Astro-man can be best 
described as a stew of punk dis-
tortion, electric guitar riffs and 
computerS used to scramble their 
already disjointed sound into 
something really unfamiliar. This 
group has been around since the 
early '90s, starting off as a small 
college group in Alabama . Sur-
prisingly, their experimental style 
was not embraced in their small 
Southern town with open arms. 
This led to pin-balling through 
several cities on a surf/garage 
theme quasi-tour. Their longevity 
through the deterioration and 
resurgence of the underground 
garage scene has produced Eroi-
ac, the newest addition the 
groups' unique sound . 

Man or Astro-man's sound 
carries a fast punk beat with slices 
of techno breakbeats and digi-
tized tunes. Eeviac follows a 
mixed format where all the tracks 
are blended into one homoge-
nous amphetamine induced tail-

spin . Their influence from 
Kraftwerk, Devo, and Sun Ra are 
splattered all over their album 
with sporadic bursts of distortion 
and dark electronic bass lines. 
The energy of each track is almost 
exhaustive, as Man or Astro-man 
blend in both the frenzied pace of 
punk with the deliberate and 
repetitive rhythm found in tech-
no. The result is the next genera-
tion in speed music where speed 
metal gets processed through hi-
fi machines and their software. 

However, the prospect of a 
bad migraine looms in the energy 
of the album. The lack of individ-
uality between the tracks and the 
group's aversion to lyrics cause 
the album to be appreciated sole-
lyon a "noise" level There are no 
words to express the frustration 
found in the music, just noise. But 
sometimes, that's all we want to 
hear.

-**** 

Fresh, fun, and full of energy, 
Ash's newest release demon-
strates vision and talent. Oh yeah, . 
it rocks. Like a musical kaleido-
scope, one twist of Nu-Clear 
SOl/lids reveals intenSity and wail-
ing guitars; the next a landscape 
of broken souls and pained exis-
tence. In other words, the album 
mimics life. 

"Jesus Says" blasts out of the 
gates with purpose and a catchy 
"woo hoo" chorus, carrying that 
rock-tili-we-drop mentality 
through the Beach Boys-inspired 
semblances of "Wild Surf." But 
just as the band seems to be head-
ing toward predictability, they 
make a radical transition into the 
beautiful and textured "Folk 
Song," showcasing lead Singer 
Tim Wheeler 's versatility and 
delicate voice. 

But nowhere does this versatil-
ity show up better than on "Bum 
Out," which requires Wheeler to 
teeter between a harsh reality and 
a dreamy sentimentality. In a way, 
Ash are magicians, pulling tri-
umph out of heartbreak and 
desire out of darkness 
("Aphrodite"). That the occasion-
ally dark lyrics are layered over 
pop riffs and flavored with emo-
brooding only proves that Ash 
still understands the irony of life 
and love.

Run While You Still Can Slow lourney' 
Bruce Willis and Michele Pfeiffer make marriage frightening Little problems add up to make 'FelicioS 

Journey' a first -class ticket to nowhere By GENEVIEVE cox 
Senior Staff Writer 

Many students complain that 
UCSD doesn't offer an impressive 
selection of bachelors and bache-
lorettes, but if you're one of the 
few still holding onto the hope of 
finding your soulmate and enjoy-
ing matrimonial bliss from here 
until eternity, don' t see "The 
Story of Us." 

"The Story of Us," directed by 
Rob Reiner, of "When Harry Met 
Sally" fame, presents a brutally 
realistic view of true love lost in a 
sea of misunderstanding. 

While the acting is stellar and 
the movie is well-made, the in-
depth look at the journey of a 
married couple through 15 years 
of more downs than ups is alto-
gether disturbing. 

By JERIMY GRAY 
Senior St.f ..nter 

A young woman's journey 
from Ireland to England to find 
the father of her child, a lonely 
man's obsession with caring for 
homeless girls and a character's 
descent into madness - these 
are the ingredients of a poten-
tially fine independent film. But 
undeveloped characters, a weak 
plot and even weaker story-
telling make "Felicia's Journey" 
one trip not worth taking. 

It is hard to pin down exactly 
what went wrong in this film, so 
it figures to be a culmination of 
many little things. 

Atom Egoyan's haphazard 
directional style, in wnich he 
bounces from flashback to flash-
back, is a cinematic headache. 

anything more than drift with 
the patl\ that life choo5es for 
her. 

And then there is Hilditch 
(Bob Hosldns), one of the most 
muddled character studies to 
come along in quite a while. A 
successful but reclusive bache-
lor whose life revolves around 
"helping" homeless girls, 
Hilditch spends his spare time 
(which is most of his time) 
watching tapes of his mother 
Gala's COOKing show. He 
makes feasts only to eat them 
alone. 

Bruce Willis and Michele Pfeif-
fer star in the picture, which is 
basically a sequel that could have 
been titled "Why Harry Should 
Have Met Sally and Just Left It at 
That." Willis is cast as a delight-
fully entertaining but irresponSi-
ble author whose refusal to grow 
up has created a rift in his mar-
riage. Pfeiffer plays his wife, a 
stay-a t-home mom . whose anal-
retentive demeanor and insis-
tence on scheduling every aspect 
of their lives has left her burnt out 
and resentful. 

RalPh NetIOll/Cour18ty 01 ~ P/ctuIes 
....... Lows: Willis (left) and Pfeiffer give good performances 
but the message is clear: Marriage doesn't work so don't bother. 

The greatest flaw, however, 
is the character of Felicia her-
self, played by the striking 
Elaine Cassidy; Her weathered 
but innocent face beams under-
neath jet-black hair, lending just 
a touch of mystery to an other-
wise plain girl. As the film pro-
gresses, however, there are 
never any reasons to care about 
Felicia. She's a two-dimensional 
character defined by her almost 
primitive quest to get her man 
back. Worst of all, there is no 
evolution from innocence to a 

It turns out that he used to be 
known as "Gala's boy," a glutto-
nous schlub of a like content 
with staring at Gala the way a 
dog eyes a steak. Through mul-
tiple flashbacks, we watch him 
steal money from strangers, 
throw up raw liver and view an 
opera with the same binoculars 
he uses to watch the television 
from his feast-laden table. To 
say that he is obsessed with his 
mother is an understatement; to . 
cast him as Oedipus may pre-
sent a more accurate descrip-
tion. 

With such disparate personali-
ties, Pfeiffer and Willis seem to 
find reason to argue violen tly in 
every scene. More importantly, 
after 15 years of conflict, both 
characters harbor such a reserve 
of bitterness that the fights -

often over something as trivial as 
whether or not to write a letter 
before or after having sex - drdg 
on for days. 

This is what makes "The Story 
of Us" so upsetting. Both Pfeiffer 
and Willis portray lovable charac-
ters with quirky personalities that 
the viewer can easily appreciate 
and enjoy. In addition, it is clear 
that despite all the turmoil, their 
marriage was founded on true 
love for each other. The problem 
is that real-world demands have 
obscured the genuine goodness of 

both husband and wife, as well as 
their love for one a.nother, render-
ing the marriage a painful failure. 

"The Story of Us" makes mar-
riage seem impOSSible. If the 
viewer has no ambitions to find 
that special someone, raise a 
family and live happily ever 
after, then he or she will most 
certainly be able to enjoy all the 
redeeming qualities of the film, 
including the fine acting, direct-
ing and character development.

hood. Rather, Felicia is merely a 
grain of pollen carried by the 
wind, never quite able to do 

Of course, Felicia looks like a 
young version of Hilditch's 
mother, so at the first opportuni-
ty, he steals her traveling money 
to keep her dose to him. 

The rest of the movie deals 
with the premise that Hilditch, 
pretending to help Felicia find

FlGHTCLUB: 
Brutal, violent motif

ContInued froM ..... 1. 
to the screen with all of the exper-
tise of his previous films. 

Norton first appeared on the 
big ~creen in 1996 in films such as 
"Primal Fear" and "The People 
vs. Larry Flint ," Next year he will 
direct and star in "Keeping the 
Faith" with Jenna Elfman. As 
" Fight Club"'s Jack, he serves as 
both the film 's narrator and co-
founder of Fight Club. 

Pitt has been in the movies 
since 1987, although one would-
n't know it due to the long string 
of duds he's been in. Pitt finally 
achieved recognition in 1994 with 
"Legends of the Fall," but it's 
really his later films such as 
"Twelve Monkeys" and "Seven" 
that have brought him success as 
an actor. 

Norton and Pitt are both fated 
to play their respective roles in 
"Fight Club," and they interact 
extremely well throughout the 
film. Unfortunately, Carter's sup-
porting role was less involved 
than the others. However the 
actress (who generally takes more

her boyfriend Johnny, is secretly 
making sure that she will not find 
him. He wants Felicia to love him, 
to make his life tolerable. In fact, 
one major plot hole occurs in such 
a sequence - while searching for 
Johnny at a hotel , Hilditch spots 
him behind Felicia and makes 
sure that she does not turn 
around. How did he know what 
Johnny looked like? Maybe he 
just guessed . 

Besides the obligatory sui-
cide-beca use-I-see-how-ev i 1-1-

straight-laced roles, e.g . 
"Howard's End") performs flaw-
lessly, never seeming out of place. 

The real genius behind "Fight 
Club," however, lies in its story 
and the way in which the plot 
unfolds. Director David Fincher 
("The Game" and "Seven") trans-
lates the story to the silver screen 
from the novel by Chuck Palah-
niuk. 

Fincher ' s ability to accurately 
convey the themes of the novel to 
the screen is what gives the film 
its edge and makes it truly worth 
the price of admission. The sets 
are dark and dirty, the characters 
are unstable and disturbingly 
macho and the plot works itself 
in and out of the story in such a 
way that audiences are never 
really sure what's going to hap-
pen next. 

Despite the dirtiness and the 
instability, the shifting plot and 
the blood gushing from Norton's 
nose, there's something attractive 
about the world that Fincher and 
Palahniuk create, making "Fight 
Club" a highly recommendable 
film. 

" Fight Club" opens tomorrow 
in theaters throughout San Diego.

to be that true love will be con-
quered by practical considera-
tions. Two fine people, their love 
for each other and for their chil-
dren was not enough to preserve 
even a little daily harmony in the 
household of "The Story of Us." 

In the end , marriage, accord-
ing to Reiner, is inevitably syn-
onymous to misunderstanding-
a force against which true love 
stands little chance.

sequence, it becomes painfully 
obvious that we never really 
learn anything about these char-
acte rs that was not already obvi-

lack any emotional impact and 
thus are not memorable. Throw 
in two caricatures of religious 
messengers (complete with 
Jamaican accents) who show up 
at the strangest times and you 
have one car wreck of a movie.

we are left with is a little slice out

Completely 'Spaced Out' 
UCSD hosts an exhibition of graduate and student work 
By CLAIRE CARASKA 
StfJff Writer 

"Spaced Out: Southern Cali-
fornia Vernacular," an art exhibi-
tion of works about social space, 
opens this Friday, Oct. 15 and will 
run through Nov. 15 on the UCSD 
campus. 

The exhibition features work 
by current UCSD graduate stu-
dents, recent graduates of region-
al art schools and two UCSD 
visual arts professors. "Spaced 
Out" has been organized in con-
junction with the Western 
Humanities Alliance Conference 
and is curated by UCSD graduate 
students Steve Ausbury and 
Sarah Lewison. 

from 6 to 9 p.m. 
Other events, such as a slide 

presentation by the Center for 
Land Use Interpretation, will take 
place on Sunday, Oct. 17 at 2 p.m. 
A panel discussion with artists 
from the exhibition will follow at 
3:15 p.m. 

The focus of the exhibit is on 
how people exrerience the spatial 
vernaculars- 0 Southern Califor-
nia. One piece that exemplifies 
this concept of perceptions of 
physical space is the site-specific 
work, "Lovers' Lane," by gradu-
ate students David Dilworth and 
Elena Bernardi. 

deSignated pink "L" spots for 
twenty minutes. Occupants 
who particirate in romantic 
activity wi! be allowed ten 
more minutes to display their 
affection. 

According to Dilworth, "a 
parking lot is the pinnacle of how 
the culture at large designates 
public space. The space is flat-
tened out and gridded off in a 
Cartesian way." Rules are to be 
followed in such a regulated envi-
ronment. Dilworth wanted to 
transpose this public esthetic into 
a private space, as in "Lovers' 
Lane" where two individuals can 
be intimate althou2h 
they are in pubric 
view. "Lovers' 
Lane" embodies the 
idea of how publiC 
spaces affect our pri-
vate lives.

FAME: 
Energetic cast pumps 
life into classic musical 
c.tInued rro. .... _ 11 
its use of comedy. Making use of 
some very appropriate vulgarity, 
typical high schoo l antics are 
taken to a new level when the vir-
ile Joe "Jose" Vargas, played by 
Jose Restrepo, sings "Can't Keep 
it Down," which could just as eas-
ily be named "Can't Keep it in My 
Pants." 

The downfall to having such 
strong comedy dispersed 
throughout a musical is that the 
dramatic scenes are left out in 
the cold, with little or no segues. 
For the most part, "Fame - The 
Musical " ambushes its viewers 
with dramatic scenes, leaving 
the crowd surprised rather than 
moved . The comedy, however, 
makes up for the choppy segues 
with perfectly timed punch-
lines. 

The songs in "Fame - The 
Musical" are enthralling and 
delightfully eclectic. Ranging 

The UCSD Guardian 

from rap to classical voice, the 
singing is bold and engaging. The 
dancing in "Fame - The Musi-
cal " is equa lly phenomenal, 
incorporating everything from 
ballet to break dancing. 

Part of the effectiveness and 
the overall power in "Fame -
The Musical" comes from the 
musical's capacity to exp lore 
touchy subjects that often erupt 
between different ethnicities, 
classes and backgrounds. The stu-
dents at Fame are rich and poor, 
black and white. Few other musi-
cals, or any other mediums, tack-

Ie such a large range of social 
issues with such candor. I t is this 
ability that allows "Fame - The 
Musical" to really spea k to the 
crowd . 

Most of all, "Fame - The 
Musical " is fun . Songs like 
"Mabel's Prayer," hit a note 
with a nyone who's ever 
watched what ther ate, exp lor-
ing the dilemma 0 keeping thin 
or eating everything in front of 
you . The cast is young and 
energetic and the s tory enter-
taining and real. It's a guaran-
teed hit.

UCLA Considered a Solid 
Contender for Hoops Title 
lAWN': Bruins hope to repeat 1995 title run 
., AJ. CADMAN 
Daily Bruin 

(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES -
With UCLA men's basketball in 
full swing beginning with 
closed practice Sa turday, the 
Bruins enter the 1999-2000 sea-
son with high hopes and a few 
absences. 

All of the major college basket-
ball publications have the Bruins 
ranked in the Top 25 national 
polls. Basketball Times slates the 
Bruins the highest of any other 
preseason selection a t No. 4 in the 
country. Basketball News places 
UCLA at No. 10 and the Sporting 
News picks the Bruins to fall at 
No. 15 in the most recently 
released polls. 

Individual preseason honors 
from the same publications are 
definitely not few and far 
between. Junior guard Earl 
Watson, the Bruins' top retuming 
scorer at 13.3 points per game and 
starter in all 64 games UCLA has 
played during his two seasons, is 
part of a No. 6 (Sporti/lg News) 
ranked backcourt, first team AII-
Pac-to (&slettball News) and one 
01 25 candidates for the Wooden 
Award, given to the. national 
player of the year. 

Jerome Moiso, JaRon Rush 
clOd Dan Gadzuric were select-
ed to preseason Second Team 
AII-Pac-10 by the same publica-
tions. 

HEarl Watson is now this 
teem's leader, both on and off 
the court," said Head Coach 
Steve Lavin during Tuesday's 
UCLA Media Day at Pauley 
Pavilion. 

"He has been a catalyst for us 
the last two years. His offensive 
production improved last year 
and we are always depending on 
him defensively to stop our 
opponent's top guard ." 

The Bruins return Gadzuric 
and Moiso as one of the nation's 
most dominant inside tandems. 
After successful surgery to repair 
the lateral meniscus in his left 
knee, Gadzuric attended Pete 
Newell's Big Man Camp, consid-
ered by many to be the foremost 
authority in the development of 
the nation's amateur and profes-
sionallow post players. 

Moiso was selected to the 
freshman All-American team by 
College Hoops Insider and should 
stretch the defense with his 
perimeter shooting. 

"Both were injured at various 
times during last season," Coach 
Steve Lavin said. 

Joining the Bruins this year is 
1999 McDonald's All-American 
Jason Kapono. The 6-7 forward 
from Artesia High School in 
Lakewood is a deadly shooter 
and consistent from the charity 
stripe. 

"The UCLA coaching staff is 
thrilled to have Jason join our 
program," Lavin said. "His abil-
ity to shoot the basketball will 
help us in the areas of three-point 
and foul shooting." 

For the UCLA men's basket-
ball team, classes have begun and 
homework has initially piled on. 
But their first test of the quarter is 
not until Nov. 23 against 
Fairfield . Hopefully for UCLA 
fans, there are no late-night cram 
sessions.

two games to none) we are all 
going to be treated to the first 
Red Sox and Yankees playoff 
series in their history. They have 
been·rivals for over 100 years but 
hive always been in the same 
division so, until the wild card, it 
was impossible for both to make 
it to the postseason. 

The Red Sox needed to bust 
out 22 runs to win game four and 
a mere 12 to win games three and

What: Located south of 

Horseshoes and north of 
Simmons, Little Point can get 
hairy on big. south swells. Big lefts 
grind over a shallow reef. The 
takeoff zone is small, so una~ 
sive surfers will have a hard tinle 
picking off the good ones. There's 
also a strong current that drags 
surfers too deep, so pick a point of 
reference on land. Win: Try it on 
a medium tide. Also, go early - it 
can get junky.

WIlDt : Just north of Windansea, 

Simmons is a hollow right that 
breaks over a shallow reef. The 
fickle wave sucks and spits on 
stronger western swells. Whe'l :

five. Without Martinez's late 
inning heroics, it is doubtful that 
Boston's 12 runs would have been 
enough. 

I am one of those baseball 
purists who believes that the Cy 
Young award is for pitchers and 
the MVP is for everyday players, 
but I am willing to make an 
exception this year. When it 
came down to it this year, and 
his team needed him, Martinez 
was there to save the day. 

The last time the MVP award 
was won by a pitcher was when 
Dennis Eckersly went through 
the entire year while only blow-
ing one save. That year he basi-
cally won by default, as there 

the reef will be exposed and 
you'll be in pain. 

""1 .... 
. What: One of the most famous 

and immortalized waves on the 
west coast. The peak is really 
shifty, so it helps to camp out at 
one spot - a set will eventually 
roll your way. Otherwise, good 
luck catching cmy good ones as 
Windansea is ridden with old 
guys on 9-foot boards. When: It 
fires on big south swells, and 
basically picks up any good 
swell out there. Note: Strong cur-
rent and heavy shorebreak. 
Strong localism too. 

.,1Iock 
WIlDt : A good proving ground 

for South Pacific surfing. Big Rock 
is a heavy, spitting and barreling 
left that grinds along a ledgy rock. 
Surfing it right means pulling in 
and getting tubed. Wilen : Surfable 
on any swell. Note: Highly local-
ized, very crowded.

What: A fun, concentrated peak 

with short lefts and longer rights. 
Nearly a half-mile from shore, but

was no real strong contender 
among position players. 

This year Manny Ramirez 
had one of the better years by a 
hitter in recent memory, ending 
with over 40 home runs and 
over 160 RBI. In spite of all these 
impressive statistics, Ramirez 
just couldn' t pull his team over 
the top in crunch time. 

When it came down to it this 
year, and his team needed him, 
Martinez was there to save them. 

When nobody else could do 
the job in game five; he took the

them into a matchup with the 
Yankees. That is the definition of

during winter on medium-low

bottom. Note: Can get super-
crowded when it's on.

What: A series of reefs span-
ning from the Point to

but best during the winter. 
Wilen : Medium tides.

What : Located at the very 

south end of La Jolla , 
Tourmaline is another excellent 
spot for leamers and longboard-
ers. Though the waves are often 
walled, it's slow enough and 
mushy enough to facilitate 
learning. When : Anytime for 
slow, mellow surf.

Triton Volleyballer Discusses UCSD Athletics 
INSIGHT: Allison Bender talks about her team's goals, as well as college sports in general 

Courtesy of UCSD AthletICS 

By BRIAN WELLES 
Associate Sports Editor 

If there were any untold 
truths about the fighting spirit 
and determination to win a 
national championship that the 
UCSD Women's Volleyball Team 
possesses, they were certainly 
revealed yesterday afternoon in 
an interview with senior Allison 
Bender. 

Bender herself, who has been 
instrumental in a handful of the 
Tritons' 18 victories this season, 
sat down and talked about a 
Triton squad that shares compas-
sion and a desire to work hard 
toward the goal of winning a 
national title this year. 

Having already vanquished 
the championship stage of com-
petition by capturing a national 
title when Bender was a sopho-

more in 1996, UCSD has contin-
ued its winning ways this year. 
Br amassing a sensational record 
o 18-1 thus far in the season, the 
team has set the stage for anoth-
er successful run a t the ti tie and 
glory is again in sight. 

Bender, a native of San 
Diego's own EI Cajon, attended 
Grossmont High in that city 
before coming to UCSD to play 
volleyball. Her brother jlayed 
volleyball at Stanford dn when 
asked if there was anyone who 
inspired her, she referred to. 
Currently, she is a pre-med biol-
ogy major. While she plans to go 
to medical school, she is not sure 
if that is the career path she will 
follow. On the other hand, the 
career she has going right now as 
a collegiate volleyball player 
seems to be of great value to her. 

In her four years on the court 
at UCSD, her fondest memory 
with the Tritons has been win-
ning the national championship. 

"It was an amazing experi-
ence," she says. "I just can't even 
describe how it felt to win the 
national title .. . eSpecially [at 
UCSD) with all the fans and sup-
port." 

Bender described the sheer 
excitement of playing on an 
NCAA court. At RIMAC, she is 
especially lucky to be playing in 
such a prestigious facility and 
fortunate to be associated with a 
volleyball program as highly 
ranked as UCSD's. However, 
regardless of having the oppor-
tunity to play in a nice building 
and the luxury of having profes-
sional coaching that is character-
istic of any strong sports pro-
gram, Bender's experience on 
the court has been further elevat-

ed by winning a national cham-
pionship. 

Having gone through such a 
feeling of elation makes her high 
school volleyball experience 
minuscule in comparison. 
"[College volleyball) is a lot 
more competitive and there is a 
lot more unity on the team. 
Everybody works hard to be the 
best on the team," Bender said. 

"The girls aU have such 
great attitudes, 
everything is done by the 
team and for the team. 
This make everyone 
work hard and want to be 
the best." 

-A\honBender 
UCSD women 'S volleyball plCl)'er 

In terms of physical differ-
ences between. high school 
players and those in college, 
Bender said that the latter were 
"a lot more athletic, a step high-
er," and that there is more 
strength and conditioning -
both of which are to be expect-
ed . But the most significant dif-
ference for Bender was the 
unity among players on a col-
lege team. Being under more 
pressure in college due to hav-
ing to manage time more effec-
tively and playing in front of 

• larger crowds, team members 
must rely on each other for sup-
port. Such support makes indi-
viduals on a team closer and 
they in turn work better as a 
cohesive force. 

In the case of the Tritons, a 

special connection exists, which 
translates into love for the game 
and a desire to achieve as a team. 
"The girls all have such great 
attitudes, everything is done by 
the team and for the team," 
Bender said. "This makes every-
one work hard and want to be 
the best." This aspect of team-
work is what has made the 
women's volleyball team aD-III 
powerhouse this season. 

Furthermore, the Tritons' 
coaching staff, with Duncan 
McFarland at the helm, has vastly 
contributed to the team's 18-1 
record . "I've learned so much 
about volleyball, and I have so 
much respect for what he says," 
Bender said. "Everything that he 
says and everything that he tells 
me to do, I try and fix it." The way 
in which he challenges his players 
to work harder on their tech-
niques in a very difficult manner 
is something that Bender sees as a 
coaching asset. 

In addition, the unselfish 
attitude that seems to permeate 
throughout the women's vol-
leyball team is evident in 
Bender's goals for herself. 
When asked about her personal 
goals for the season, she replied 
that she'd like to help her team 
as much as pOSSible to get to the 
final four. She doesn't pay 
much attention to her statistics, 
and she believes her numbers 
are important to the extent that 
they equal victories. 

The Tritons' next home game 
is against Juniata College, the 
team UCSD beat to win the 
national championship in 1997. 
The game starts at 7 p.m. on 
Saturday. Come out and root on 
our volleyball team!

that this incredibly potent Indian 
offense, an offense that became 
the first to score 1000 runs in a 
season in the last 40 years, could 
not even manage a bloop single 
against Martinez. When it was all 
said and done, the Indians went 
hitless for the final six innings 
and the Red Sox won the game 
12-8. 

Now, I'm not a big Martinez 
fan (probably because the 
Dodgers traded him away for 
Delino Deshields and now the 
guy is the best pitcher in the 
league) but you have to give it to 
the guy. In a year when balls were 
flying out of the ballpark more 
frequently than UCSD students 
run to the library to do their ().. 
Chern, Martinez's ERA was only 
a shade above 2.00. His 23-4 
record was the best among 20 
game winners since Roger 
Clemens' in 1987 (coincidentally 
Clemens will be Martinez's oppo-
nent in game three of the 
American League Championship 
Series). 

The cover of Sports 1II11strated 
this month says, "Martinez or 
Ramirez, Who's the MVP?" 
Ramirez refers to Manny Ramirez 
of the Indians. To me, that deci-
sion was made for all the MVP 
voters on Monday. They went 
head to head, both players had a 
chance to send their teams to the 
A LCS, and Martinez won. Clear 
and simple. 

Because of Martinez's heroics 
(most notably coming back from 
an injury to win the series for the 
Red Sox after they were down

-Ted Tumer 

Monday started out omi-
nously. After about four hours 
of sleep, I dragged my decrepit 
body out of bed at 7 a.m. to go 
to class, still exhausted from 
doing homework the night 
before. I made it to the .:: Iass 
five minutes late - just in time 
to take a surprise quiz that I 
really didn' t understand and 
to hear the professor say that 
the due date for the homework 
that I had done the night 
before was po tponed until 
Wednesday. I said to myself, "I 
guess it is just going to be one 
of those days." 

The day continued in this 
fashion for the next nine hours 
as I was constantly forgetting 
things, dropping things, hurt-
ing myself and so on. 

I finally got home at about 
5 p.m., exhausted from my day 
and lack of sleep, and ready to 
wind down while watching 
some sporting events. 

"Monday Night Football," 
however, was a total bust -
the teams combined to score 
22 points in one of the s lowest, 
most pathetic games I have 
ever seen. At the sa me time, 
however, was the Red Sox-
Indians game, which made up 
for everything. 

When I turned the ga me on, 
the Red Sox were down by two 
and there were men on second 
and third with one ou t. 
Charles agy walked omar 
Garciaparra to get to Troy 
O'Leary. O'Leary then 
promptly blasted a grand slam 
into the right field bleachers. I 
cou ldn't help but smirk at the 
Lndians' failure in strategy, for 
I despise them almost as much 
as the Yankees (but not even 
close to as much as I hate the 
Giants). Little did I know that I 
would be driven to full laugh-
ter when a similar si tuation 
happened in the sixth inning.

According to UCSD Surf Team captain Sander Nauenberg, the best wave 
in San Diego is "A sick, little left 
reef located on the inside corner 
of Mission Bay. But it's fickle, and 
it only works on an east swell, 
with a direct onshore wind. But 
be careful. it's heavily localized 
by body boarders on Price Club 
sponges with webs." 

In other words, find your own 
best spot. To do so, check out the 
following list of spots from La 
Jolla to Pacific Beach. Also, don't 
be afraid to venture to north 
county or south-of-the-boarder. 
Especially when Shores is good. 

..... '. Wllat: The days of uncrowded 
Black's is now a thing of the past. 
While "the key" is still hard to 
come by, enough people have a 
copy to fill up the entire lot. 
Coupled with the hundreds of oth-
ers who coast down the road and 
brave the Goat Trail, Black's is one 
of the most surfed spots in San 
Diego. Why? The bigger it is, the 
better it gets. Wlum: Black's gets 
good surf all year. Generally speak-
ing. if Scripps is shoulder-high, 
alack's will be head-high. Good 
lefts on any swell. Best on a medi-
um-low tide. Note: Novice surfers 
should surf as far south as possible. 

........ 
What : Hollow lefts and rights 

on both the north and south 
sides of the pier when the tide is 
right. The south side is usually 
more consistent, but also more 
crowded. It is also black-balled 
during the summer months. 
Wllell : Blocked by La Jolla Cove, 
Scripps is small during south 
swells. However, from late-fall 
through spring, Scripps will 
always have fun, peaky surf 
pending any decent-size west or 
northwest swell. Note: Thin mid-
day crowds. 

La ..... _ ' 
What : A good beginner's 

wave: small, slow waves and 
readily accessible. However, 
shores can get big, hollow and 
lined-up during bigger winter 
sweUs. When: Shores is fun year-
round, but it can get super-
crowded on nice weekend days 
- usually packed with long-
boarders and groms. 

La lalla Cove 
What : Best known for its 

insane snorkeling and diving -
on any given day divers spot 
dozens of sharks - the Cove also 
breaks once or twice during each 
winter. This big, mushy left is 
very rideable during strong 10 to 
20-foot winter swells, if you're 
willing to get caught ·inside. The 
cliffs above the Cove are the per-
fect arena for watching big-wave 
surfing. La Jolla-style. When : The 
Cove rarely breaks, but when it 
does it's the perfect party wave. It 
works on macking north/north-
west swells. Note: It's a long pad-
dle to the point and the La Jolla 
Cove caves love to swallow 
boards and bodies. 

.... ,1tIIIa 
What : Breaking over a shallow 

shelf, Hospitals has definitely 
eamed its name. Waves come in 
and swing over the reef to pro-
duce a hollow left. Best on a 
medium-to-higher tide. Whell: It's 
hit and miss year-round . 

............. 

Wlia/: Strong south swells pro-
duce heavy, bowling lefts that 
grind across a shallow reef. 
Super-crowded when it's on so 
you have to be aggressive to pick 
off the good waves. When : 
Horseshoes can get good year-
round. Note: Use caution when 
coming in, especially on a big

F NOTES 
With one out and a man on 

second base, Lndians' manager 
Mike Hargrove again chose to 
walk Garciaparra to get to 
O'Leary. 

Tritons Stay Alive with Clutch Victory 
Once again, on the first 

pitch, O'Leary showed them 
that he deserves respect, hit-
ting a three run home run to 
put the Red Sox up for good. 

After three innings of horri-
ble pitching on both sides, the 
score was tied at eight and the 
Red Sox brought in Pedro 
Martinez. What followed was 
one of the si ngle best post-sea-
son performances I have ever 
seen . 

It was obvious that the 
Indians were hitting well that 
night since they had already 
put up 8 runs, but Martinez 
slowed them down. In fact, he 
did more then slow them 
down - he grabbed them by 
the neck, quickly dug a hole in 
the middle of the field and 
threw the collective Indian 
offense into it while simultane-
ously burying them with the 
dirt from the mound. 

OK, maybe that's a bit of an 
overstatement, but the truth IS

S'nLL KICKING: Tritons survive a must-win game at Cal Lutheran to stay in the playoff race 
By· BILL BURGER 
Sports Editor 

It was do or die last Sunday 
for the men's soccer team. If it 
won its match against Cal 
Lutheran University, it would still 
be in the running for the playoffs. 
If the team lost, it could start 
making other plans for 
November that didn't include 
soccer. Those plans will have to 
be put off a little bit longer, as the 
Tritons prevailed over the 
Kingsmen 3-1. 

The Tritons got good news just 
before the match began, as start-
ing goaltender Lucas Curtolo felt 
well enough to play. Curtolo had 
been out for the previous two 
games with an injury to his leg. 

"Lucas was a last minute deci-
sion," Head Coach Brian 
McManus said. "He checked out 
OK just before the match began." 

With their starting squad 
now in/lace, the Tritons took 
the fiel with confidence and 
vigor. 

This confidence was squashed 
just two minutes and 42 seconds 
later as Cal Lutheran's Andrew 
Montenegro took a cross from 
Brian Hinkle and headed the ball 
past Curtolo from 8 yards away. 
The goal put the Kingsmen up 1-
o and stunned the Triton faithful 
who had made the trip to Ventura 
County. 

UCSD could have 
given in to the pressure 
from the Kingsmen 
and the glaring heat 
of the sun, but they 
fought on, and five 
minutes later their efforts 
were rewarded as Derek 
Orchard took a cross from Brady 
Bernard and struck his header 
into the back of the net. With the 
game tied again, the Tritons had 
new life and were thirsty for 
more. 

Less than four minutes after 
Orchard's goal, Bernard con-
trolled the ball in the box and was 
dragged down by a Cal Lutheran 
defender. The referee blew the 

whistle and awarded UCSD a 
penalty kick. Cameron Adams 
stepped up and buried a blast 
past Matt Mahler, the Kingsmen' 
goaltender, to give UCSD its first 
lead at 2-1 . 

Just two minutes and 20 sec-
onds later, Orchard added his sec-
ond goal of the match. Mike 

Sanders passed to Orchard in 
the box and Orchard rico-

cheted the ball off of a 
Kingsmen defender 
and past Mahler to 
give the Tritons a 3-1 
read . 

After the torrid 
pace of the first 15 

minutes, the game ~an 
to slow as the sun starteO to 

get the better of both teams. The 
remaining 75 minutes were score-
less and the Tritons left Cal 
Lutheran defeated. 

"It ~as really, really hot," 
Armstrong said. "Things really 
started to slow down as the 
match went on." 

The Tritons did not have much 

time to savor their victory over 
Cal Lutheran, as they immediate-
ly had to look ahead to their 
upcoming matches. These match-
es include a game against 
Division II Cal Poly Pomona and 
Division I University of San 
Diego. 

"We have tough matches the 
rest of the way," Armstrong said. 
"We will really have to protect 
our loss column because we 
know the [tournament) commit-
tee will be watching." 

Despite the tough road ahead, 
Armstrong and his team are opti-
mistic when the)' consider their 
chances. 

"We have settled down and 
are playing well now," 
Armstrong said. "We just want to 
keep going like we are and try to 
avoid injuries." 

The Tritons will have a chance 
to keep going strong when they 
take on Cal Poly Pomona on the 
road and then return home to 
take on Briar Cliff College of Iowa 
on Sunday.
