Falling Minority 
Enrollment Still 
AUCConcem 
• Ed on blame fall on fee increa e ; 
other point to non-diver ity of faculty 
By Dan Krauss 
Staff Writer 

Enrollment of ethnically diverse ~tudents at the Univer-
it y of Cal i fornia has dropped dramat ically overt he past t \VO 

year ' despite increasing eligibility of minority high school 
graduates, according to a recent study. 

The study, compi led by Universi ty of California Student 
A sociation (UCSA) Vice President John Edson and based 
on data from the UC Office of the President and from the 
California Post-Secondary Education Commission. :-hows 
that every major hi gh school ethnic group has sh wn a 
substantial increase in U eligibility from 1986 to 1989. 

However, enrollment in U schools has shown a marked 
decrease in the past two years. during which there were 10 
percent and 40 percent fee increa~es. respectively. 

Edson said that UCS D has ~OIl1e of the lowe~t minority 
enrollment figures C-wide. citing African-American en-
rollment as an example. A cording to data from the Office 
of the President, African-American fir~t-ycar:-.tudent enr 11 -

A.S. Wants Say 
In SCU Space 
Reallocation 
By Francisco DeVries 
Staff Writer 

Associated Students executives claim that the Uni-
versity Center Board (UCB) ignored the A.S. in the 
board's attempt to reallocate the now-defunct Student 
Credit Union's (SCU) space in the old Student Center. 

Meanwhile, at Monday night's UCB meeting, 
three additional organizations applied for the space, 
which the General Store Co-op had applied for at last 
week's UCB meeting. 

Last year the UCB allocated the space to the AS. , 
on the condition that it be used for a student credit 
union. A.S. President Mike Holmes and Vice Pre i-
dent Administrative Randolph Siwabessy say that it 
was never notified that the UCB had reclaimed the 
space. 

Fonner UCB Chair Molly McKay contends that 
the AS., and Holme, in particular, had been informed 
well in advance of the board's actions last week. 

When the University and State Emp)oyees (U.S. E. ) 
Credit Union dropped its financial backing and the 
A.S. was unable to find a replacement parent credit 
union, the SCU was forced to close in early March. 
Subsequent attempt. to locate a parent credit union 
also failed and the UCB. enacting a clause in the 
contract between the UCB and the AS. that guaran-
teed the pa e be used for a cred it union or be deeded

Computer Purchase May 
Have Wasted $4.8 Million 
• Official says procurement 
of new machine necessitated 
by emergency fund regulations 
By Da vid Ferris 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD administration may have 
spent more on the purchase 0 f a new adm i n-
istrative computing system last summer 
than was necessary, according to indepen-
dent computer brokers who often work 
with the universi ty. 

A month before the beginning oi Fall 
Quarter. 1991 , the administration made an 
emergency purchase of new computer hard-
ware, the IBM 9021 -580, from IBM for 
$6.3 million. 

Two computer equipment salesmen in-
dependently claim that equivalent hard-
ware could have been bought used for only 
$1.5 million. 

One of the independent brokers, who 
wi hed 10 remain anonymous, said, "[The 
university's] lack of planning cOSt million 
of dollars ." 

The brokers charge that the administra-
tion went straight to IBM to purchase the 
equipment without on. ideringpurchasing 
secondhand equipment that cou ld have done 
the job at a lower cost. 

One of the salesmen. Jerry Jeremiah of 
the Municipal Leasing Corporation, acom-

pany which leases after-market computer 
equipment. said. " I'm a taxpayer too. I get 
pretty upset when I see them spend mill ions 
they didn't have to spend." 

UCSD's Administrative Computing 
Operations. or "Adcom:' was responsible 
for the purchase. Adcom Director Charles 
Hudgins confinned in a written tatement 
that the possibility of purchasing used equip-
ment was not pursued. 

Adcom officials projected that purchase 
of a used system wou ld have incurred extra 
costs. Hudgins said. "We do not buy used 
equipment because the cost ofmaintenance 
outstrips the savings from buying a u~ed 
system." 

The anonymous broker argued that $4.8 
million. the amount that would have been 
saved by buying a used system, would be 
more money than could be spent on main-
tenance. 

Jack Wil son. associate director of 
Adcom. said that Adcom also preferred a 
new computer becau. e the delay caused by 
creating more space to house larger. used 
equipment would have forced the univer-
sity to pay overtime hours while the staff 
processed infonnation by hand. 

According to Adcom officials. Adcolll 
made an emergency purchase of the new 
equipment because in 1991 it wa~ sched-

About 200 students and faculty gathered in UCLA's Royce 
Quad to prolest university fee increases at "The Grear American

legislalors and university officials while imultaneouslyedu-
cat ing the campus about the ~·budget cn is, which has 
caused regislfarion fees 10 nearly double in the lasl three years, 
said GSA Vice Pres ident External Michael Lichter. 

The GSA invited all campus faculty to conduct their classes 
in Royce Quad and give lheir students an opportunity 10 learn 
aboul the b udget crisis and ways to gel involved in lobbying. 
Lichter sa id he thought the teach-out was a success, although 
only teaching assistants c hose to partic ipate. 

"1 think it we nt well," Lichter said. "I think it was a good 
sturt." 

Teaching As istant A lexandria Lustgarten le t her students

their televi ion sets, wondering what the new president will 
say on his first day inoffice. There isa feeling that nothing bad 
can happen - a new golden age is upon us. 

After Chief Justice Rehnquist fi nishes the formal inaugu-
rJtionceremony, the new president step upto the podium and 
prepares to . aya few words. H. Ro:.s Perot, the 42nd Pre~idcnt 
of the United Stilles, proudly surveys the audience ~itling in 
rapt anticipation before him. 

" My fellow Americans," Perot begins with his di~tJllCtive 
Texas drawl, "/'vegot big pl.1n forth is country. Bigplan\ ... " 

Suddenly, the lokie. durken, giganti thunderhead!> gather 
from the east, and the president \ voice begins to change. "Big

too long. he cries. It' s time to lake merica back. he urges. But. 
then again. we 've heard Ihe same things from the like ' qf Jerry 
Brown and Pm Buchanan. Indeed, the Libertarians have been 
\aying the same things for yean. - they were outsiders long 
before being an outsider was cool. 

PelOt has a unique talent for makiog arrogance look like 
humility. He' ~ been des.:ribed as everything from a coocerned 
right-wing populbt and a patri t toa political opponuni.t and 
a charlatan. I SliSpect he' . all of that and more. A number of 
delocriptions come to mind: m untebank, fraud. and dema-
gogue on tht: one hand; p;uriot. philanthropist, duty-hound 
citizen on the other. 

C l o s E u p 

Perhaps most disturbing is the cult follow ing the Perot 
campaign has generated all across the country. Perot denies 
that he is a politician, but this is rubbish. How can someone 
with presidential aspirations - veiled or oven - not be a 
politician? Indeed, Perot is arguably the grealest politician in 
America today because he has conv inced so many people that 
he is not. "What is happening has nothing to do with me," he 
told Time, " It has everything to do with people's concerns 
about where the country is and where the country is going. " 

He's right. People are dissatisfied. 1bey want change. Ro 
Perot has emerged as a savior. A non-political politician who 
appeal s- to everyman. And woman. People like Perot for two 
reasons: he's not George Bush, and he's not B i ll Clinton. 

H is message has made a powerful impact among co llege 
students. At UCSD. roughly 40 students belong to the newly 
formed " Students of UCSD for Effective Government Led By 
Ross Perot" (or, "Students for Perot" for shOlt). They have 
spent mOM oftheirtime and energy collecting signatures to get 
their candidate on the ballo t. According to Student:. for Perot 
Co-Chuir Nicole Sain t John. the group collected about 700 
sigllaturelo in ju~t a few days. 

" People are really excited," Saint John ~uid . " So many 
people who hd e been dbillusioned with the political process 
are getting c!xcited again:' 

Saint John and others like herm optimi~tic that Perot is the 
candidate Aml!rica ha~ been waiting for. They' re not bothered 
by the fact that hehasnoclearstanceon nnyofthemaj ri~~ues . 
" He's our best option:' she said. "We're confident that when 
he comes out with his formal views, we ' II ~till suppon him. But 
we're still being rational about it." 

Some might contest Saint John's last statement. Perot 
supponers have tended to be anything but rational. 11ley have 
been zealous to the point of fanaticism more often than nol. 
And understandably so. " I don ' t see him as an alternative:' 
Saint John said, " 1 see him as the answer." 

People are looking for an excuse to like this man. 11ley are 
looking for someone who wi ll break th~ seemingly unending 
parade of dullards and hacks who have marched their way to 
power with the help of slick handlers and powerful corpomte 
interests. "This is a corrupted system we have," Saint John 
. aid. " But it' a really wonderful system if it 's done right. " 
America needs a president to make the system right again. So 
far, Perot has fit the bill. But 100 many questions remain 
unanlowered. 

What hnppens when Perot is pressed on the issues? What 
happens when he is forced to take a sland? The people who 
support him now may find in the end that theirdisi lIusionment 
may be greater than ever. Perot supporters are good people. no 
4uestion about it. They want change. But their willingness to 
jump on the Perot bandw:lgon before he has aniculated his 
positions fully b disturbing to say the least. Perot may be 
Amerim's great hope, but he hasn ' t proven it yet. Given all of 
these doubts and concems, we would be wise to wait and see 
who this man really is before we thrust him into the White 
House. He acts :IS though he has all the answers to America' s 
problems. That's re:lson enough to doubt him.

held 111 honor of Chilean Pre ' ident Patricio 

Aylwin at the Hotl!l Del Coronado. American 
patrons paid about $200 or so to attend. 

Several UCSD :.tudents helped in the plan-
ning of the event, '0 we got to allend the 
dinner for free. in exchange for preparing the 
ballroom and the press room and greeting 
guests. 

Four other students and my elf were it-
tingat a table together. along with two paying 
patrons. a white middle-aged couple who did 
not peak Spanish (They listened to Ay lwin 's 
speech with the headphones which provided 
a simultaneous Engli h translation). 

During the course of the dinner. the woman 
patron. who knew that we were UCSD Stu-
dents. was aying that her son had recentl y 
been denied admis!) ion to UCSD because of 
"reve~e discrimination." 

Three of the tudents at our table lookt:d 
Hispanic. two of them being otiginally from 
Mexico. and this woman wru openly blan1ing 
mll10rities fOrlhe failure of her , on to get Into 
UCSD. 

According to one of the 5t udents who wa:, 
sitting nearerto herthan I wa:,. her statements 

became more offensive as the dinner pro-
gressed. At one point. according to the stu-
dent, she said that four of her friends had 
Mexican maids who had come to the United 
States just to have babies and get welfare 
assistance. 

That same student, who is a I iberal and an 
American of Mexican descent. stood up for 
his beliefs. pointing out to the woman that 
other people have very different views on 
such mailers as affirmative action. admission 
policies and immigmtion to the United States. 
The woman was 0 upset by thi small chal-
lenge that he broke into tears. and she and the 
man left the table, never to return. 

Some might say that the student had no-
right to question the elder, paying patron. 
However, I was overjoyed that he had the guts 
to speak up for what he felt wa~ right. even if 
that would up el the woman. I am jealous of 
that student'~ bravery. . 

We libeml can no longer be afrdid of 
speaking our truth honestly, for it IS a truth of 
human re:.pect badly needed in America to-

How to Get Involved With the Fee Fight 
The massive budget cuts that currently 

plague San Diego State will be coming soon to 
a UC near you. The budget is in far worse 
shape than Governor Pete Wilson originally 
estimated, and to compensate for the shortfall 
in revenues, the state is expected to slash the 
University of California budget once again. 

Originally slated for only a three-percent cut, 
the UC budget could now be hacked from 
anywhere betWeen 17 (or $350 million) and 
30 percent ($600 million). 

While nothing has been officially confirmed, 
it appears inevitable that there will be 
additional fee increases, besides the original 
24 percent proposal, in the next year. Laying-

likely. 

'We're hitting a critical point where 
expansion is a prime need, and we don 't have 
the resources," said A.S. Vice President 
External Colin Wilson . 

Now more than ever, students need to 
protect their right to an affordable, high-quality 
education . In an election year, this means 
putting pressure on the state legislature to 
protect the UC budget.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Feminists Agree: He Really Doesn't Get It 
Editor: 

Ben Boych uk i right. Hedoesn 't 
"gel II." But n t for the re~ons his 
commenwry ("Why I JUSI Don'l 
Get It," May 22) suggests. Ralher. 
he basel, his critique offemini~m on 
circular argument. generalization 
from unrepresentative ·examples. 
~tereotype~, caricatures and an in-
adequate grasp of the is ue . Thai is 
why he doesn't get it. 

Contrary 10 Boychuk's misrep-
resentation, no feminist I know of 
places al/ of me responsibility for an 
individual's per..onal successor fai l-
ure on "society . "to Ihe exclusion of 
effort and ability. He takes an obvi-
ous social parrern and insists upon 
altributing it to illLiividLlllltraits, pro-
viding no analys i~ of their origin or 
perpetual ion. 

Unless he po~its genetic inferi-
ority, how doe he account for the 
fa t Ihat roughly 50 percent of the 
adult population i~ individually "in-
capable" of succe~i> in certain occu-

pation~. which abo happen to be 

those profes ion which gamer the 
mo t re pect and power in contem-
porary society? 

By centering his argumenl 
around the examples of three loken 
women who have bcrome unu u-
ally successful in male-dominated 
arenas, Boychuk suggests that the 
only reason more women have not 
succeeded in these fields is because 
they simply are notqualifiedor have 
not lried hard enough. Yet even if 
Ihis was the sole reason. Boychuk 
doe not ask why they have not tried 
or are not qualified. 

Perhaps this is because the"femi-
nine" traits women are raised 10 
cultivate are often mutually exclu-
sive to those considered appropriale 
to CEOs, politicians, etc., not 10 
mention Ihe negalive feedback re-
cei ved by women who do possess

significantly morl! qualified to rep-

relies on ~tereotypes and on 
feminism's most fringe theorists for 
hi categorical di mi al of the 
movement. 

The women [ intetviewed are 
neither .. vengeful,· .. ·whining, .. ·!hys-
terical ," "weak," hateful or dog-
matic. Rather. they are some of the 
most open-minded, mature, realis-

people I know. male or female. 

Boychuk in no way fairly repre-
sents feminism's diversity nor does 
he adequately addres (or even ac-
knowledge) il~ concem~ in a man-
ner thal the rejection of an entire 
movement ~hould require. 

ot only does he wholly misrep-
resent the pornography debdre, he 
doe~ not even mention childcare,

Lisa Rosen 

Objectivist Society 
Blew It at Lecture 
Editor: 

On May 13, there was a lecture 
given by George Rei man entitled 
"Education and the Racist Road to 
Barbarism." Its intended point was 
to show that Western civilization is 
the best civilization and should be 
adopted by all people. Quite pre-
dictably though. a slew of left-
wingers showed up and spent Ihe 
entire lecture heckling Mr. Reisman. 
rendering the lecture comical at besl. 
instead being a serious discussion 
on Western civilization. 

The point of this leiter isn't 10 
admonish the hecklers, but rather to 
admonish the Objectivist Sociely 
for not following the philosophy 
that they ' re trying so hard to instill 
in omers. The basic mistake that the 
Objectivist Society made was that 
they made the lectureft'ee to UCSD 
students. They shou Id have charged 
money! 

Would Ayn Rand have condoned 
ajree event? In Atlas Shrugged. the 
lillie world where all the intelligent 
people escape to. nothing is free. 
Throughout the whole book. she 
ridicules those who give things away 
for free. Had the objectivists charged 
UCSD studentsS6, then those heck-
lers probably would have thought 
twice about forking up six bucks 
just to heckle rhe poor guy. And 
even if they did. hell, you would 
have made a tidy profit! And isn't 
that the whole point of Ayn Rand's 
philosophy? Profit is good! 

Next time you guys should try 
harder to follow the concept Ihar 
Ayn Rand tried to instill throughout 
her literary career, in:.tead of acting 
likc ' iali~tsandgivingthlllgsaway 
for free.

offers some", here el,e. We have to 
be more compelltive." 

Vice ChancellorofUndergmdu-
ate Affairs Joseph Watson did not 
completely rule oul the possibility 
of a correlation between minority 
enrollmem and fee increases; how-
ever, he aid he felt Ihat the fee 
increases should not bear all th 
blame. 

. 

"[The fee increasel may have 
been a factor, bUI it is not the sole 
fa lOr at all. ... Ilhink ir would be a 
mbtake to rely . olely on one cause:' 
Watson said. 

One of the major factors , ;lC-
cording to Watson. i the lack of 
ethnic diversity in the facu lty and 
staff. Watson said that although the 
university is undergoing a major 
effort 10 attain more diversity. there 
are still some dcpartments with no 
Chicano/Lalino or African-Ameri-
can faculty or staff members. 

"This is one of the major weak-
nesses of thi campus. This is a 
major problem that needs to be ad-
dressed," he said . . 

Wm on aid that steeper fee in-
creases hould not have any impact 
on enrollment because Ihere is ad-
equate financial aid for economi-
cally di advanraged students, 

According to Edson, it is "sad 
and disappointing" that UCSD ad-

mini~lrators will not concede that 
lhe fee increa\es are responsible for 
the decrease in ethnic diversity al 
UC schools. 

"They're trying to put as good a 
face as po 'sible on fee increases. 
University ofliciab are trying to 
deny a corollary effect between the 
fee incre.'1~es and ethnic diversity 
because they control the fees. 
l11ey're trying to deny a rragedy 
that's happening to this university," 
he said. 

Acting Director of the Student 
Affinnative Action and Human 
Relations Coalition (SAA&HRC) 
Tony Valladolid said he recognizes 
both sides of the argument.

OVER 
TIME 

You Think You Know 
How to Do This? 
A FfER A YEilR OF COVERING sport!. for this here rag, I have discovered that there 
a.re certain ways to do thing~. 0 
here. for all you aspiring ports-
writers, are the F Ollr Tips 10 
Sporting Scribe SlIc('ess. 

1 BE AIJU TO kl!£'p u s/ruigilt . ja('('. As a sportswriter, you 
will constantly be barraged by 
people - coache~, player • fml~. 
etc. - who wi ll say thing ... tota.!ly 

~eriou~ly, like "lle'~ a !>witch-
Ilitter who can chase the ducks 
around the pond at any time:' or 
"l le'~ got no junk and hi , ga I 
low oclane." It IS up to you to 
maintain a ,tr:.lIght face at times 
like thb. Just nod and pretend to 
cough if you can' t hold back a 
smile. Here 's an example to 
practice on: "Yeah. he's worth 
fi ve million dollars a year." 

2 PRITEND TO I.NOIV a lot aIJow • sports. This might seem like 
it l>hould be Tip # I, but if you can 
keep a straight face. thi s tip is a 
piece of cake. You will constantly 
run into people who. eager to 
impres an expert like yourself, 
will rattle off statistics like "Sure 
Juan Guzman has a 2.76 ERA. but 
his walk-to-K ratio is only 2.3-1." 
In this situation it is pennissible to 
sm ile and nod slyly. If he looks al 
you to continue Ihe debate. just 
say "You're right, he's no Roger 
Clemens." TIlat will end things 
right there, because nobody is 
Roger Clemens. At least. Ihat ' s 
what I'm told. 

3 M AKC SURC YOU know wllat • 5port it is tllul you' re 
covering . This is the exception to 
Tip #2. While you don't have to 
involve yourself with the !.pecifics 
of the game. you should know 
which variety of sport it is that 
you 're writing about. There is a 
great potential for embarrasment if 
you tum in a baseball story wilh 
the lead "The Triton gridiron 
heroe triumphed once again with 
a thrilling last minute field goal to 
nudge Point Loma, 2-1." While it 
is important to gel the name of the 
opposing team, it·s not vital. Most 
of our opponents are from schools 
wi th ridiculous sounding names . 
so nobody notice when we just 
make the names up. (What? You 
actually thoughllhere was a 
school called La Verne?) 

4 NEVER USE CERTA IN words ill a • sportS slOry. The thing to 
remember is that your averolge 
~ports page readers are individuals 
who have just learned how to stop 
drooling in public. so three 
syllable and more words are 
definite no-no's. Here is a !.ample 
entence. see if you C,ll1 pick out 

the funny !.ounding words. "After 
~veral puuling bouts of tnepti-
tude. the bulter genu flected before 
~tepping into the quadrangle. The 
pitcher releal>ed the ~pheroid. 
which collided with the butter's 
ante nor cranial region. leaving the 
competitor prostrate."

Track Ready to

• Tritons have an easy fir t day as every 
athlete qualifies for final ; throwers 
place three in top five in the hammer 
By Gregg Wrenn 
ASSOCiate Sports Editor 

There weren ' t many surpri~e~ f r U 0 after the 
fi rst day of competition at the Division III mllltlnal 
tmck championships. The Triton~ enjoyed ,ucces,ful 
opening events. with every athlete \\ ho had 4ualify ing

"We had a good day . Evel)'body did reall) well.

Teammale Jdf Taylor wa, second on thc day ",rth a 
toss of 186-7, while Paul Cogbill was firth with a 182-
3. Both Taylor and Cogbill' s mark.s were per..onal 
records. 

Perhap~ the TrilOns' mo~t :,urpri~ing penomlance 
was in the women's 4xlOO relay where the team of 
Yvelle Marzullo. Erica Washington. Renee Sprowl 
and Michelle Milledge broke the tape in a school 
record time of 47.96 seconds. TIle clocking wru. good 
enough for fourth place overall and eclipsed the old 
markof48.31. 

-The relay looks to be another promising source of 
points for UCSO. "[Christopher Newport I is clearly 
fru.ter than everylx>dy else. There ' ll be a scranlble with 
the next fourteams, but if we pass the ~tick well, we'll 
be up there," Stanforth said. 

Sargeant. looking to finish his unparalleled UCSO 
career wilh a bang, threw the discu~ 165-5. to put him 
in third place going into the finals. 

Dan McDowetVGuatd,an 
Paul Cogbill hurled the hammer 182-3 Wednesday. good enough (or fthh place.

UCSD's Water Polo Head Coach builds a tradition 
based on winning, dedication, and team spirit 
By Ken Perlman 
Sports Editor 

T ilE WORDS "DEDIClIllON," "D!,T~RMINII­tion," and "desire" ure often ones that are overu,ed in the world of sports. 
They define great athletes and are the personi -
fication of sport . 

But all too often. those who tend 10 build 
tho~e characteri~lics in their player, are over-
looked. They take a back seat to players' 
accomplbhments, and their work ethic and 

drive to \ ucceed are overshadowed by the 
talent of tho~e they help to develop. 

Forsomealhlctes. raw talent i., innate . For 
other.;, , kilb I11U~t be honed to perfection . In 
either ca~. those who play the 'pon depend 
on their coache~ to guide and teach.

But as he will be the first toadmil, the road 
to building what might besl be culled Ihe 
"I-Iarper dynasty" wasn't always a ,mooth 
one. 

Harper. whom his player.. refer to ,imply 
as " Denny." took overthe men', water polo 
program at UCSD in 1980. Ironically , he wa, 
barely older than the player, he wa, coach-
ing. 

Il arper Mruggled with himself almo,t 
immediately whentho,e player.. to whom he 
had become auatched were ready to gradu-

nes.~. His intelViews are often hilari-
ous because they're so bad and so 
tactless. He's the 010 t unpredictable 
talk-show hoston TV, and he relies the 

m~t on gags and skits. Is he capable 
of succeeding othelWi~? 

Among those with talk shows re-
portedly in the works are Whoopi 
Goldberg and Chewy ChaM. Chase 
is the odd fish of the six. The thoughl 
of him with a talk show is disturbing: 
the Ihought of him doing all intclView 
even more so. The tOcal point for his 
audience is questionable. He's not a 
big-name comic :unong the coveted 
18-35 age group. Ironically. because 
he has been in the Hollywood spot-
light longer than any of the other.>. he 
might stand the best chance of attrJCI-
ing Carson's core audience. On the 
other hand. his bmnd of humor is besl-
described aschildlike.and you have to 
wonder if older audiencCl> will go for 
his tlippant, aloof act.

prospect. She's popular among
