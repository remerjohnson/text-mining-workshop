R.urch Uncovers Receptor 
ICIINCE: Team identifies key 

. molecule that may protect people 
from heart failure and hypertension 
By Rajlnder Sekhon 
Staff Writer 

A team of researchers at the UCSD School of 
Medicine have a identified a key molecule thaI' 
protects the heart from cell death, which eventu-
ally leads to heart failure. These findings were a 
result of approximately nine years of research. 

The results of this study, published in the 
April 16 issue of the journal Cell, could 'pave the 
way to new drug therapies for heart attacks, 

hypertension and the heart-damaging effects of 
certain cancer treatments. 

Kenneth Chien, professor at the UCSD School 
of Medicine, and colleagues from UCSD and the 
University of Cologne, Germany, demonstrated 
that a mouse cell -surface receptor called gp 130 
triggers a sequence of events at a molecular level 
that protects the heart from cell death. 

Two competing pathways to the heart muscle 
are activated during periods of stress. One of the 
pathways protects the heart while the other causes 
cell death. When cytokine growth factors (chemi-
cal messengers) are released, the pathway that 
protects the heart is activated. These chemical

All-Campus 
Graduation 
Reinstated 
COMMENCEMENT: 
Qua1comm founder Irwin Jacobs 
will present address to students 
By Vincent Gragnanl 
Senior Staff Writer 

Five weeks after canceling the ceremony 
due to difficulties in securing a speaker. last 
week Chancellor Dynes re-instated thi 
year's all -campus commencement. He has 
ecured Qualcomm founder and former 

UCSD faculty member Irwin Jacobs as 
speaker. This year's all-campus commence-
ment will be held on RIMAC Field at 10 
a.m. on Saturday, June 12. 

Vice Chancellor of External Affairs Jim 
Langley said that Dynes decided to reinstate 
the ceremony after he realized that parents 
and students were clearly in favor of an all-
campus commencement. 

"I had gone to the commencement speak-
er committee and told them we had not 
secured the speaker we had hoped for," 
Langley said. "That led to reaction from par-
ents and students that caused us to reconsid-
er our decision." 

Langley said that although in the past 
student opinion was not entirely in favor of 
an all-campus ceremony, students now see 
such a ceremony as the "capstone of the 
undergraduate experience." 

Langley said that Dynes was able to 
secure Jacobs as a speaker so quickly 
because Jacobs is more involved in the 
UCSD community than many of the other 
speakers that the committee sought. 

"Irwin Jacobs is close to UCSD," 
Langley said. "We sat down with our com-
mencement speaker committee and said 
rather than look for people who are far nung 
from UCSD, let's look at someone closer to 
UCSD. When it was all said and done, it was 
clear to our students and to our committee 
that Irwin has that distinctive feature." 

Langley said that based on the feedback 
he has received, students are pleased that the 
ceremony has been reinstated. 

Langley added that the only complaints 
he has recei ved are from frustrated students

Jacobs School Receives $3 Million Grant· 
DEVELOPMENT: u.s. Navy's Office of Naval Research gives UCSD money to develop a new jet engine 
By M8rjorIe MontMIeyor 
Stsff Writer 

The U.S. Navy's Office of 
Naval Research granted UCSD's 
Irwin and Joan Jacobs School of 
Engineering $3 million to develop 
a new jet engine for cruise missiles. 

The new eosine would employ a 
pulsr detonation principle, in which a 

series of small, timed explosions of 
fuel would provide the propulsion 
necessary to drive the cruise missiles. 

Prior to granting UCSD's 
research engineers with the project, 
the Office of Naval Research 
devised the idea for a new cruise 
missile engine through a program 
called "Pulse-Detonation 

Phenomena for Propulsion." A 
research initiative was then proposed 
through the Department of Defense. 

Forman Williams, chair of the 
Department of Mechanical and 
Aerospace Engineering (MAE) at 
the Irwin and Joan Jacobs School 
of Engineering, said that there are 
several advantages of having long-

range missiles with pulse detona-
tion engines (PDEs). 

He said that PDEs cost less to 
build than standard turbojets or ram-
jets, which both utilize a denagra-
tion method of flame propagation 
where fuel undergoes steady burn-
ing. PDEs, however. are more co t

Continued fren ..... 1 
and parent who have had to 
change their plans because of the

Muir Dean Chips Dreilinger 
said that Muir college had to

"Muir is doing its 31 st annual 
commencement," Dreilinger said. 
" II was deemed very sufficient. 
Suddenly for the third year in a 
row we are expected to substan-
ti ally revise our plans to accom-
modate the all-campus gradua-

Drei linger said he has received 
complaints from parents and stu-
dents due to the change of plans. 

"Some of them leave nasty mes-
sages that work their way to me,"

messengers, including 
Cardiotrophin-I, bind to the gp 130 
receptors, activating a gene that 
blocks the cell-death pathway. 

Chien says he feels good about 
the possibility of developing chem-
ical messengers that will further the 
heart cell's capability of preventing 
itself from dying. 

"Now that we know unequivocal-
ly that gp 130 is the target, it may be 
possible to develop a biological, or 
natural, therapy-based oncar-
diotrophin- I or other growth factors 
in that family," Chien said. " We may 
be able to enhance the heart cell's 
natural protective mechanism," 

Chien said that this therapy would 
be helpful in preventing heart attacks 
and other heart damage resu lting 
from chemotherapy for cancer. 

"We are cautiously hopefu l that 
this will lead to a new class of 
drugs for preventi ng the onset of

Dreilinger said that he fears that 
all-campus commencements will 
soon upstage the college com-
mencements. 

"My fear is that in another two 
or three or four years, the college 
gradcations will disappear," 
Dreilinger said. 

Dreilinger adoed that while 
Muir traditionally has its com-
mencement al9 a.m. on Saturday, i t 
has to switch its time this year to 
I :30 p.m. He said that the morning 
time is more ideal because it is not 
as hot in the morning as it may be 
in the afternoon. 

Dreilinger also aid that because 
of conflicts with other colleges, 
Muir will have its commencement 
on RIMAe Field instead of the 
Marshall field where it usually

mouse" that did not have the gp 130 
receptor present in its heart but did 
have it present in all its other ti s-
sues. This animal was one of the 
first examples of a new generation 
of knockout mice, in which a gene 
has been specifically mutated in a 
specific tissue. 

John Ross Jr., a professor of 
medicine who also contributed to 
the Cell paper, said the knockout 
mouse was an important invention 
for preventing heart failure. 

'1'he gp130 knockout mouse is 
an important discovery because it 
is called a conditional knockout, 
which means it comes on after 
development, and is important for 
preventing program cell death," 
Ross said. 

The mice had normal heart 
structure and function, but they 
rapidly developed enlarged hearts 
and massive destruction of heart 
muscles during stress, such as 
severe h yperten ion 

Chien says that this experiment 
proves that the gpl30 receptor and 
the pathway it activates is neces-
sary to prevent heart failure. 

" We've now been able to show 
in a li ving organism that the gp 130 
receptor and the protective path-
way it launches are critical to pro-
tecting the heart against heart fail -

The UCSD Guardian 

A .S. President Tesh Khullar said 
that as the new representati ve of 
the undergraduate community, he is 
pleased with Dynes' decision to 
reinstate the ceremony. 

" I am for an all-campus com -
mencement," Khullar said. " I 
think the students are in favor of 
an all -campus commencement. As' 
a representative of the students, I 
think it good that he brought it 
back." 

Langley said that despi te the fact 
that this year's commencement may 
be last minute, he is confident that 
the ceremony will run smoothly. 

" We just had a meeting of the 
commencement committee this 
morning," Langley said. " We have 
the experience. We know where to 
get the materials. We predict it will 
be well-planned and well-prepared. 
We don' t anticipate any problems 
at this point. 

Langley also said that while the 
decision is up to the chancellor, he 
predicts that Dynes will continue to 
hold all-campus commencements 
in the future. 

ure," Chien said. 
Chien said that the protecti ve 

pathway increases the size of mus-
cle cells, leading to heart enlarge-
ment, in order to protect the heart 
and keep it pumping during high 
blood pressure, injury or infection. 

He added that enlargement of 
the heart, known as hypertrophy, 
allows ·it to survive the initial 
stress. However, this process can 
also weaken the heart as a result of 
the thickening and stiffening of the 
chambers and the reduced efficien-
cy of the pumping in the heart . 
Hypertrophy eventually lead to a 
decrease in heart function, heart 
failure and premature death. Chien 
said he hopes that the findings will 
lead to reduced hypertrophy. 

"Since the gp 130 pathway leads 
to less cardiac injury, our hope is 
that there will be less heart hyper-
trophy in the long run, a well," 
Chien said. 

However, he said there is a lot 
more work to be done in learning 
how to prevent heart failure, 

" I think that there is a lot more 
work that needs to be done and this 
is only the beginning of a new 
approach to protecting against the 
failing heart with secreted factors 
that protect heart muscles against 
injury," Chien said.

Once Again, 'Students Get 
the Short End of the Stick 

There are two certainties in life: Death and taxes. 
At UCSD, undergraduates face similar certainties: 
Tuition and always getting the short end of the stick. 

Since 1996, the Office of Facilities Design and 
Construction has been working on a $1,179,000 sig-
nage project that involves the establishlT1ent of over 
250 signs at UCSD and the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography. 

The creation of these signs will certainly be a great 
benefit to a significant number of first-time visitors 
to the campus. Drivers and pedestrians who are unfa-
miliar with the layout of the campu will certainly 
appreciate the simplicity of never having to stop and 
ask for directions. 

HJlwev ; as an organization that represent the 
and concerns of the undergraduate student 

population at UCSD, the Guardian must question how 
these expensive signs will benefit the common student. 

While the campus may seem daunting and com-
plicated to student and parents during Welcome 
Week, it is hardly unnavigable. Freshmen quickly 
acclimatize themselves to the campus landscape and 
rarely require assistance when trekking from one end 
of school to the other. 

We've all gone frantically scrambling acros cam-
pu , searching for our clas on the first day of chool. 
But how many students haven ' t been able to manage 
for more than a week? ' 

Of all the issues that student have been fighting for 
this year, we at the Guardian have never heard anyone 
demand that UCSD construct more signs. Instead, the 
undergraduate voice ha demanded parking, housing 
and all-campus commencement - issues that have 
been met with barely satisfactory responses. 

the UCSD Rugby Team 
Deserves More Recognition 

The UCSD rugby team won its second consecu-
tive Division II National Championship last week. 
Did the Intercollegiate Athletic department take 
notice? Probably. Will it do anything about it? 
Probably not. 

The lack of notice is a shame. Since 1966, the 
UCSD rugby team has consistently proved itself to be 
among the nation's best. It is a perennial playoff con-
tender, often making it to the "Big Dance" as it did last 
year, marking UCSD's first-ever Division II title. 

This year's show was no different. These hard-
working guys put together an amazing season and were 
ranked No. I in the nation going into this April's United 
States Rugby Football National Championships. 

From there, they performed as expected, outscor-
ing their competition 80-24 in three matches - an 
amazing feat. The championship game was closer 
than usual, but UCSD prevailed over Chico State 21-
18, to bring home its econd title in as many years. 

For this reason, the Guardian would like to ee a 
change implemented at the athletic department from 
the highest level. We encourage the Intercollegiate 
Athletic department to reconsider its mid-1980s deci -
sion to drop rugby as an intercollegiate sport. After 
all, rugby wa UCSD' fir t intercollegiate team; 
those guys were our first Tritons. 

Beginning fall quarter 2000, UCSD athletic will 
leave Division JII for Division II competition. In light 
of this move, we at the Guardian have already found 
your poster boys. And they come with two titles.

PARKING MUST GET WORSE 
BEFORE IT GETS -ANY BETTER 

COMMENTARY: 
Campus parking woes 
will escalate before new 
structures are completed 
By Kevin ' Seld 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Parking this year has been a night-
mare. Everyday, students wander around 
the parking lots of UCSD searching for 
that rare empty parking spot. According 
to surveys conducted by the 
Transportation and Parking office, 
almost all parking spaces on the south-
ern and central areas of campus are filled 
before 10 a.m. Even a majority of the 
spaces in the east and north campus lots 
are occupied around 10 a.m. 

Many students become angry and 
frustrated trying to find parking. Most 
are unable to park in spaces close to 
their classes. If they are lucky enough 
to even find a space, it is far away and 
commuters must either hike or take the 
shuttle to class. Some even choose to 
park illegally, only to find a ticket on 
their windshield when they return to 
their vehicle later. 

These parking problems will get 
even worse this fall . In the summer, 
construction will begin for two new 

p~ing structures and a surface lot to 
deal with the ever-increasing parking 
demand. Once completed in the fall of 
2000, they will provide a total of 1,840 
parking spaces. They are scheduled to 
be under construction throughout the 
entire 1999-2000 school year. 
Unfortunately for commuters, both of 
them will be placed on sites that cur-
rently have existing parking lots. As a 
result, numerous parking spaces will be 
lost during construction and commuters 
will be forced to find parking elsewhere. 

One site, the North Torrey Pines 
parking structure, will be built on the 
southern half of parking lot 305 north 
of the Marshall Residence Halls. It 
will provide approximately 970 park-

1hesepalldng

.. mmer, construction 
will begin for two _w 
palldng structures ....

ing spaces once it is completed. Greg 
Snee, the director of the 
Transportation and Parking Office, 
estimates that about 310 parking 
spaces will be lost, including all 50 
"8" spaces and 249 "S" spaces. 
Students living in the Marshall 
Residence Halls currently use a major-
ity of those 249 "s" spaces. During the 
fall, these students will have to park on 
the north side of lot 305, and conse-
quently, force those commuters who 
normally park there to find spaces 
elsewhere. This will be completely 
unfair and inconvenient to all students 
who use that parking lot everyday. 

The Gilman parking structure will 
be located behind the Registrar's 
office, near the comer of Russell Lane 
and Gilman Drive. It will be south of 
the Visual Arts Facility and west of the 

ERC Residence Halls. The structure 
will provide about 870 parking spaces, 
office space for the Transportation and 
Parking Services, penn anent room for 
the Credit Union and storefront space 
at the ground level. 

The site currently consists of the 
Physical Plant warehouse and shops, 
Central GarageIFleet Services and the 
western portion of parking lot 406 
consisting of "8" spaces. The 
Transportation and Parking Office 
estimates that about 142 parking 
spaces will be lost during construction. 
These spaces include 56 "8" spaces 
and 10 "A" spaces in lots 406 and 410 
and 76 spaces used by service vehicles 
of Central GarageIFleet services. 

Exactly where those service vehi-
cles will be placed during the con-
struction is yet to be determined. 
Unfortunately, they will most likely be 
put in existing parking lots currently 
used by students, thus displacing park-
ing for those commuters as well. 

I! also has yet to be detennined exact-
ly how the two new partOng structures 
will be allocated. The major factors 
involved in the decision are the overall 
parking problems in general and the esti-
mated demand for Fall 2000. The North 
Torrey Pines parking structure may 
mostly consist of "s" spaces and some 
"8" spaces. It might benefit some stu-
dents when the structure is completed, 
but it will be a burden to others who 
have classes on the other side of campus. 

The Gilman parking structure might 
be less beneficial for students. I! will 
probably consist of many "A" and "8" 
spaces and numerous other spaces for 
service vehicles. But it remains to be 
scen how many "s" spaces will eventu-
ally be allocated there. Many students 
will want to park there because of its 
central location. Unfortunately, there 
probably will not be enough "S" spaces 
to meet the demand. Thus, the parking 
structure will not help most students.

by people's perception; the fact 
that people base this perception on 
things like market share and law-
suits is secondary . 

So, if you want to make a lot of 
money, you just have to under-
stand the psychology of the mar-
ket at any given time. The current 
psychology can be summed up in 

successes of the past; the mayhem 
is still going on. More and more 
companies are going public, and 
the people who get in on the 
ground floor are making a lot of 
money. A good rule of thumb for 
investing in Initial Public 
Offerings (IPOs) these days is to 
check the company's prefixes and 

share was snatched up from the 
underwriters faster than toilet 
paper in a Russian ration line. I 
figured I'd cool my heels and just 
wait for the first day of trading, 
and get in on it early before the 
rush. 

The Transportation and Parking 
Office does plan to build a new sur-
face lot to meet these demands. The 
new lot, scheduled to open in fall , 
will hold about 1500 "s" parki'1g 
spaces and will have access to the 
campus shuttle system. 

Making smart investments is 
easy. Professional investors and 
financial consultants would like 
you to think that only people with 
degrees from Ivy-league schools 
and fancy credentials can do it, but 
that's not true. You just have to 
understand how the market works.

Fat chance. The public offer-
ings went for SIS a share, and the 
first registered trade on May 4 was 
for S27; the value of the stock 
instantaneously shot up 80 per-
cent. Those who managed to get in 
on the IPO made out like kings, 
and the rest of us were just left 
holding our hats. 

However, the new lot may not be 
that helpful to students either. First 
of all, parking-permit holders cur-
rently are pennitted to park in "S" 
parking spaces regardless of 
whether they have "A", "8" or "S" 
pennits. Those "A" and "B" pennit 
holders who will be displaced by the 
construction will most likely park in 
those spaces, and thus seize valu-
able parking spaces from students. 

Now, I'm not about to go and 
explain the whole thing to you and 
give away my secret ... oh .. . what 
the hell .... 

A lot of people think the stock 
market is determined by quarterly 
'reports and changes to the board of 
directors and stuff like that. It is, 
especially if you're investing for 
the long run and like to get divi-
dends and stuff like that, but the 
big money is in capital gains, 
where you make your money by 
selling your stock at a higher price 
than what you bought it. Capital 
gains is a whole different kind of 
animal. 

The value of a stock isn ' t deter-
mined by revenue, profits or any of 
that nonsense. It's determined by 
psychology. A stock is only worth 
what people think it is worth. Now, 
admittedly, this perceived worth 
has a lot to do with all the econom-
ic indicators that I just dismissed 
out of hand, but it's important not 
to get the two confused. First and

"Well, if you 've got it all figured

to get in on the ground floor. Any 
idiot can pick a winning lntemet 
stock, but only rich or lucky idiots 
can get a hold of them. 

Take MapQuest, for example. 
MapQuest filed for an IPO and 
was scheduled to trade the week of 
May 3 (hey, that's this week ... ) It 
fit the profi Ie: Internet company, 
doesn't make a whole lot of 
money, cool looking logo ... so I 
looked into getting in on it before 
it went public. No dice. Every 

So the lesson is this: There is 
no such thing as easy money. 
There may be stocks that are 
almost certainly sure things, but 
everybody knows it and so every-
body scrambles for them, and if 
you ' re lucky enough to get a piece 
of the action, enjoy it, because it 's 
like winning Ihe lottery, and a 
whole lot of people didn' t even get 
tickets.

Another of this parking lot's 
major problems is its location. The 
new parking lot will be located in 
the empty field west of Regents 
Road, south of Voigt Drive and east 
of the UCSD Medical Center. A few 
parking spots will also fJe paved in 
the empty field around Voigt, 
Regents and Genessee. Thus, the 
Regents Road parking lot will be 
the easternmost parking lot on the 
East Campus and by far the furthest 
lot away from the center of campus. 

In addition, once the Regents 
Road parking lot is completed, the 
Transportation and Parking Office 
plans remove the 78 parallel "S" 
spaces along Hopkins Drive east of 
RIMAe. The e spaces were added 
this past winter break to help alle-
viate this year 's parking demand.

TV IMITATES UCSD LIFE 
COMMENTARY: 
Television characters 
emulate life, yet still 
seem to have more fun 
By Ward Han 
Associate Opinion Editor 

It 's Saturday night. Karyn is 
crying. surrounded hy a group of 
friends and suitemates. Her grand-
father has just died and her suite-
mates arc tryi ng to comfort her. 

Across the hall. Susan can't go 
to sl.:ep thanks to the noise and 
vihrations coming from her room-
mat.: and hcr roommate's 
hoyfriend . 

Downstair~. Sherry just took 
om: too many swigs and was sent 
to the hospital for alcohol poison-
ing. Her fri end and drinking part-
ner Dan took off his tighty-
whitcy 's and pranced around 
singing "We arc the Champions." 

It seems like an MTV "Real 
World" episode. a re-run of 
"Beverly Hills 902 10" or in 
Sherry's case. "ER." But it 's no\. 
Actually. this is life in Argo Hall 
in Revelle with the characte r~' 
names changed. 

To someone who doesn 't live 'in 
Argo Hall or any of the dorms at 
UCSD. this dorm life must sound 
very exciting. That 's panly why I 

chose to pay $7.000 to live in the 
dorms. I saw movies that depicted 
college life like "PCU" and 
"Revenge of the erds." and I 
wanted to experience that exciting 
dorm life myself. In fact. this sum-
mer. I thought to myself. "l'm 
going to UCSD next week. r d bet-
tel watch 'Deadman on Campus,' 
just to get into the college mood." 

When I settled in at UCSD. 
however. my mindset changed. 
People around me were complain-
ing. "UCSD is so boring," or "This 

i~ such a nerd school. College 
sucks." Like many other students. 
I tried to maintain a positive atti -
tude. but the my friends' negative 
attitudes were almo t dragging my 
t:Ollege ex perience down. 

I didn 't realize how exci ting 
my life was until I was home this 
winter break and watched a col-
lege epi ode of "Felicity." On that 
show. there were slutty girls who 
slept around. 

Wait a minute. I know omeone 
just like them at UCSD. On that 
show. there are tense moments 
between roommates that were the 
hackbone of the drama. Here at 
UCSD. relationships between 
roommates are always interesting. 
On that show, backstabbing and 
gossiping were common. Here at 
UCSD. we have A.S. elections. It 

suddenly hit me. shows like 
"Felicity." "90210" and "Party of 
Five" are portrayals of UCSD life. 

It sure is more fun to watch our 
lives than to live them. perhaps 
because television shows neglect 
to portrcly our hours of studying for 
finals . Then again, television 
shows at least have scenes of 
studying. 

Perhaps it 's just more fun to 
watch the beautiful Jennifer 
Aniston get in a fight with her 
roommate on "Friends" than it is 
to actually fight with your pimply 
roommate. Or perhaps it's just fun 
to watch something on television 
that just happened in your life. 
on ly television shows always 
show a quick. happy ending. 

But I think these arc all excus-
es. People who say their lives at 
UCSD are boring fail to sec that 
the televi ion industry is making 
millions of dollars by showing us 
our own lives. 

The next time someone in my 
hall blows up a toilet with a stick 
of dynamite. or someone trips 
himself completely naked and 
thcn walks with his genitals 
exposed to pour detergent in the 
Revelle Plaza fountain. I'm taping 
il and making it a show.

Temporary parking 
spots to be removed 
Continued frOlll ..... IS 

These spots were of temporary 
use because the bike lanes on both 
sides of the road had to be removed 
to make enough room. The 
Transportation and Parking Office 
is committed to re toring the bike 
lanes in its efforts to also improve 
bicycling facilities on campus. 
Employees of this office say that 
the Regent Road lot will adequate-
ly replace those temporary spaces. 
Unfortunately, those 78 spaces arc 
far closer to the center of campus 
than the new parking lot. The 
removal of those spaces will hurt 
students who parked there 10 be in 
walking distance of RIMAC and 
the library. 

The projected estimates provided 
·by Snee state that the 530 total park-
ing spaces that will be lost by the 
construction o(the parking structures 
and the removal of the parallel spaces 
along Hopkins will be replaced by 
the Regents Road parking lot. The 
new lot will provide a net gain of 
about 970 campus parking spaces. 

Unfortunately. those 970 new 
spaces will not help the parking 
problems. Many commuters do not 
like parking in east campus because 
Ihey must eilher make the long hike 
or use the shuttle. Even using the 
huttle can be frustrating. For one 

Thursday, May 6, 1999 

thing, there is a considerable waiting 
time. For another. these shuttles tend 
to fill up so quickly that many stu-
dents have to wait for lhe next one. 

The construction of the new 
parking structures will force many 
students to park in the easlemmost 
parking lot far away from the cen-
ter of campus. As a consequence. 
many more students will become 
angry and frustrated about not hav-
ing parking spaces close to their 
classes. They will continue 10 wan-
der in the packed parking lots clos-
er 10 the center of campus. They 
will still park illegally. nirting with 
the prospect of getting a ticket. 

In the future, these problems 
may be further compounded by an 
increase in the demand for parking. 
This will include new commuters. 
such as freshmen and transfer stu-
dents. who want parking as well. A 
higher demand will mean thai the 
parking lots will fill up quicker. 
forcing many to park in spaces far 
away. And if the demand becomes 
great, the net 970 gain of parking 
spaces may not be adequate. 

Parking should be one of the last 
things to cause stress for students. 
Most have enough of it trying to deal 
with c1asse , papers and midtenns. 

Finding parking on campus 
takes away valuable time. Many 
waste time waiting for the shull Ie 
to pick them up or hiking from dis-
tant parking lots to class. This time 
could be better spent studying or 
doing something more useful.

SEATTLE, Wash.- In response 
to the tragic murder ~f gay 
University of Wyoming student 
Matthew Shepard, President 
Clinton recently moved to expand 
the federal hate-crime bill to 
include assaults on homosexuals 
and the disabled. In the magical 
world of Washington D.C. where 
good intentions of politicians auto-

extension makes perfect sense. But 
in the political reality where the 
rest of us live, hate-crime legisla-
tion marks a depanure from equal 
treatment under the law that is dan-
gerous for several reasons. 

First is the arbitrary classifica-
tion of some crimes as "hate" 
crimes. Who gets to decide which

erate the concept of equal treatment 
before the law and effectively sanc-
tion the idea that the life of, say, a 
homosexual man is inherently 
more valuable than that of a hetero-
sexual man. 

It's not hard to see the danger in 
this. What happens when today's 
"protected" classes lose political 
control tomorrow whi Ie other 
groups sway the criminal code 
towards special protections for 
themselves? The harsh punishment 
of black-on-white crime during the 
days of Jim Crow teaches a sharp 
lesson about the imponance of 
equality under the law in a free 
society. . 

Hate-crime laws are also subject 
to selective and arbitrary enforee-
ment. When something as fuzzy as 
"intolerance" is criminalized, we 
leave the door wide open for prose-
cutors to determine which preju-
dices are acceptable and which 
aren·t. And in our politically cor-
rect world where others' "interpre-

tations" of words and deeds matter 
more than actual intent (illustrated 
by the recent "niggardly" episode), 
this is a dangerous road 10 travel 
down. 

These laws can be easily used to 
protect cenain groups and punish 
only certain crimes as "hate 
crimes." The truth is that all violent 
crimes are hate crimes. We don't 
need special protections against 
certain acts of brutality. We need 
strid punishment for them all . 

Hate.crime laws are clearly a 
legal redundancy. Common law 
protections against violent crimes 
already exist, allowing judges to 
impose harsh penalties for horrible 
crimes. What additional penalties 
can federal hate-crime legislation 
impose on violent. murderous gay-
bashers? Death-plus? Crimes of 
bigotry are obviously very real, but 
hate-crime laws aren't any more 
likely to deter them than the death 
penalty is to deter murder. 

Similar to campus "hate-
speech" codes, hate-crime laws 
also criminalize certain types of 
unpopular thought - a direct 

assault on the First Amendment. As 
ugly and bigoted as these thoughts 
may be, we've got to recognize 
others' right to think them in a free 
society. Rights are violate-l only 
when people decide to violently act 
on Iheir prejudices, and our exist-
ing criminal code already makes 
this illegal. What good would spe-
cial "hate-crime" laws serve here. 
other than to unfairly police unpop-
ular thoughts? 

Perhaps the most invidious 
thing about hate-crime laws is that 
they serve as political placebos 
that allow our government to 
maintain the status-quo of gay 
inequality. By posturing them-
selves as supporters of hate-crime 
laws, politicians can appear "tough 
on crime" while sidestepping the 
most pernicious crimes committed 
against gays: State-sponsored dis-
crimination in the military and pro-
hibitions of same-sex marriage. 
The hypocrisy in this i~ embarrass-
ing. 

Supporters of hate-crime laws 
argue that even if such laws have 
no effect on crime. they're still 

needed since they "send a mes-
sage" that bigolry won't be tolerat-
ed in society. But these "messages" 
are interpreted differently by differ-
ent individuals, often in unantici-
pated ways. While some see hate-
crime laws as the sign of a tolerant. 
enlightened community, others see 
them as inherently valuing some 
victims of violent crime more so 
than others. 

Hate-crime laws have single-
handedly turned an issue that once 
united us into one that deeply 
divides us. They also give ammuni-
tion to anti-gay activists who 
would accuse homosexuals of 
seeking "special rights." Does the 
value of "sending a message" real-
ly outweigh these social costs? 

Gay activists have long wanled 
the government out of their bed-
rooms; eagerly inviting them back 
in for hate crime "protection" is an 
unwise move at best. Can't we 
agree to keep group-identity poli-
tics out of our criminal code, if 
nothing else?

INVESTMENT: People underestimate the complicated nature of internet trading 
By Renada Rutmanls 
The Daily Californian 

(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Cali f. 
- Want to get rich quick and not 
worry ahout paying off that 
mounting pile of student loans? 
Some students have milked the 
Internet fo r fast cash, but they may 
want to think twice before they try 
to make their millions on the 
Internet. 

A new way of investing online 
called day trading, which involves 
buying stocks and then rapid ly 
tradi ng them within the day or 
sometime ' within the minute, is 
the newest phenomena to hit the 
mobs of students who spend more 
time on the Web than in their 
classes. 

Rather than investing long tenn 
for the future, many students 
choose to risk it all on the vo latile 
changes in the stoc k market. 
Instead of investing through 
expert brokers, many student s 
make and lose money in the pri va-
cy of their own home, often wi th-
in days or even minutes. 

According to bu iness adminis-
tration Professor Mark Rubinstein, 
the easy access to the Internet is 
encouraging people to trade more 
than they should. 

He also adds that many people 
would be wiser to invest for a 
longer period of time and that the 
old advice to buy and hold should 
still be followed. 

Yet some people continue to 
think they belong to the small 
minority of investors who can beat 

the stock market and make money 
where other have failed. 

"A typical day trader would 
make more money if they invested 
in a widely diversified fund ," says 
Rubinstein. ''The problem with 
human beings is that typically they 
thi nk they are more intell igent 
than average." 

He adds lhat inve tor often 
undere timate the compli cated 
nature of the stock market and 
how it is set up. People are not 
competing against one person but 
a group of very smart investors, he 
says. 

"T he market is very smart , and 
people must be very, very man to 
beat the market by skill ," says 
Rubinstein. "And if they do beat it. 
they interpret it as skill and not 
luck." 

Some experts estimate that no 
more than one or two of every 10 
professional day traders make 
money, according to an article 
publi shed in the Los Angeles 
Times on Feb. 21 , 1999. 

Despite these daunting statis-
tics, people are attracted to the thrill 
that comes with trading so quickly. 
Some feel as though they are on the 
floor of the New York stock 
exchange, where people do often 
make split-second decisions that 
can lead to huge wins or losses. 

Many online companies por-
tray investing on the Internet as an 
easy way to make it rich. In a com-
mercial for Oiscover Brokerage, 
there is an 18-year-old who makes 
enough money investing online to

buy his own helicopter. 
But just as there is the possibil-

it y of making money qui ckly, 
there is also the risk of 10 ing 
money just as fast. 

When investor buy and sell a 
large number of stocks on a daily 
or weekly basi , it can affec t the 
tability of the stock market to a 

great degree. 
"The Internet is good for 

investing but it depends on how 
you look at it," says business 
administration seni or Etsuhi ro 
Ikeda. " It ' good if you want to 
make money quickly but it al 0 
makes the market more volat i Ie." 

{keda adds that he doos not 
th ink college tudenl should 
invest because it can "get really 
crazy" and they should not be wor-
rying about making money for 
retirement or other things that are 
too fa r away. 

So how exactly does day trad-
ing work? Students can buy stocks 
online through Web sites, most of 
which also give up to the second 
updates on stock prices. 

Oay traders buy stocks for one 
price an<\ then quickly try to sell 
them for a slightly higher price. 
While the amount of money made 
on each transaction is fairly mini-
mal, over a period of time there is 
the chance of making a profit. 

However, it requires a great 
deal of time and effort to make a 
large profit. 

According to the Web site at 
www.daytraderl.com. the volatile 
nature of the stock market is the 

exact reason why day trading 
makes sense. 

Companies such as Yahoo! and 
AOL have the potential to rise or 
fall by five to 10.percent in one 
day, according to the site. Students 
who bought 100 hares of 
Netscape on July I, 1998 and sold 
it the next day, would have yielded 
$ \.200 in just 24 hours. 

Because the changes in the 
stock market can be so extreme, 
day traders do not have much con-
tro l over the price of their stocks. 

And how does the average stu-
dent learn to invest? For starters 
they can look at the hundreds if 
not thousands of Web sites that 
give advice and information about 
the online version of Wall Street. 

Many of those Web sites give 
information for free but many oth-
ers only tempt the reader with one 
or two tips and then advertise 
classes or books that cost any-
where from $20 to more than 
$1,000. 

With so many Web sites and 0 
many companies, it is hard to know 
which ones give legitimate infor-
mation and which ones are just as 
clueless as most Web surfers. 

Some investors also rely on 
information they find in chat-
rooms that are exclusiv~ly for day 
traders. Web sites wam, however, 
that some people may dispense 
false information in order to sell 
their own stocks at a higher price 
and any advice gained through 
chatrooms should be investigated 
further.

"With a POE, the fuel is detonat-
ed - which provides propulsion -
versus a standard engine where fuel 
is burned without detonation," 
Williams said. 'This requires fewer 
moving pans and is thus simpler 
and less costly to build." 

Williams added that other poten-
tial advantages of POEs include an 
ability to operate continuously from 

. low subsonic to high supersonic 
flight speeds and greater versati lity. 
The POEs wi II also feature a speci f-
ically tailored fuel injection. 

The $3 million funding for the 
project will be spread out over a 
period of three years, with the engi-
neering school receiving $1 milliQn 
per year. Allocation of the money 
can be extended for up to five years. 

Other institutions working on 
the project include Stanford 
University. the University of 
Florida, the Naval Research 
Laboratory, the Naval Postgraduate 
School, California Institute of 
Technology, Princeton University 
and Pennsylvania State University. 

Williams said that the research, 
which will be composed of both 
theories and experiments, should 
take approximately five years to 
complete. 

"We think our expertise and 
fundamental research will generate 
the knowledge needed to bring 
promise of POE to fruition," 
Williams said.

dmit day .... 
My vision was assaulted 

with rows upon rows of 
eucalyptus tress planted in 

an orderly, anificial manner. In between the trees, 
concrete sidewalks splayed out in every direction 
and converged into one all-encompassing expanse 
of white pavement - as if a wave of cement had 
swept up onto the campus, never to recede into its 
proverbial sea. Great concrete buildings seemed to 
have been born of this wave, sprouting. vertically to 
dwarf the wandering students trapped in this envi-
ronment of lines and planes, cubicles and nine-digit 
identification numbers. 

One day, while driving up Campus Loop Road 
toward Revelle College, I saw one building that was 
not conforming to the ''this-is-a-building-where-we-
<krscience" style that surrounded me. Its face was 
painted with revolutionaries such as Angela Davis and 
Che Guverra. It seemed fitting that it was on the edge 
of campus. I thought to myself, "Maybe this campus 
does have some character. Maybe it will be all right" 

Eventually I discovered that this lonely building 
was the Che Cafe. It has been providing music, food 
and a political atmosphere for the UCSO communi-
ty and the general San Diego population since the 
late '70s. 

The Che has a rich history, which began in 1965 
when it served as the original student center, serving 
burgers, fries, beverages, etc. When the 
wooden student center was buill 10 
years later, the Che area remained 
open through student funding. 

Thanks to a supportive A.S. 
Council and Student Center 
Board - both of which 
agreed with interested "co-
opers" that a building support-
ed by student fees should 
become a mecca for stu-
dent-run organizations -

Story by 
Amreen 
I(armali, 
Guardian 
Reporter 

JolIn Barber / GIIatdan 

the Che became the Coffee Hut Collective. This 
step was organized by members of the then-new 
Food Co-op (with which it has had a close relation-
ship ever since). In 1980, the structure's name was 
changed to the Che Cafe, with the goal of providing 
roughly the same services that it strives to provide 
today. In the past it served more as a cafe, selling 
cheap vegetarian delicacies daily, and later began 
varying its purpose in order to serve as more of a 
venue for educational meetings and musical shows 
up to five times a week. 

The Che has seen some hard tirm;s, as it tends to 
move through cycles from year to year according to 
the influx (and more often the out-nux) of the stu-
dents who come i!1to try their hand at UCSO's (and 
dare I say, San Diego's) most unique and enlighten-
ing social experience. 

While change is usually a good thing, the 
dynamic nature of the Che's membership core has 
led to numerous confrontations with UC adminis-
tration, which isn't always empathic to the 
unfortunate fact that nearly every year or 
every series of years, the Che core prac-
tically has to learn how to run the orga-
nization from scratch.

TEATRO TLAQUETZQUE DEBUTS TONIGHT 
Celebrating Raza Awarness Week, Teatro Tlaquetzque features 'La Victima' 
BY'Melody Gonzales 
Staff Writer 

As part of Raw Awareness 
Week at UCSD, Tealro Tlaquer-
zque will present its debut perfor-
mance of director Goyo Flore '''La 
Victima" Thursday ni~ht on the 
UCSD campus. Fuunded 10 
December of 19911 by Flores, 
Sandy Corte (both of whom are 
UCSD alumni) and Shaun Davis, 
the Chicano theater group 's prima-
ry goal is to promote Chicano the-
ater by enhancing the exposure of 
local actors, tage managers, direc-
tors and artists in general. 

Tlaqllerzqlle, the word for which 
the group is named, comes from the 
Aztec language ahuatl and means 
"those who make things stand out." 
By bringing "La Victima" to 
UCSD, Tealro TLaquerzqlle hopes 
to do just that. 

Director Flores recalls being an 
undergraduate theater major at 
UCSD in 1976 when the number of 
Chicano theater students could be 
counted on one hand. 

''There were only about three of 
us in the theater department and 
nobody would really talk to us or 
take us seriously," Flores said. 

It wasn't until current UCSD 
theater profes or Dr. Jorge Huerta 
directed the first Chicano play at 
UCSD that Mexican-American 
actors were recogni zed on campus. 

"Dr. Huerta opened a lot of 

doors for us, we owe a lot to him. 
He was our teacher and now we're 
teachers too," Flores said. 

During Flores ' years at UCSD, 
several Chicano students came 
together to create a realro group on 
campus. Mil Caras, meaning "one 
thousand faces," was comprised of 
several Chicano tudents whose 
majors ranged from theater to biol-
ogy to history. 

A rearro is a Chicano theater 
group that often-perforrns as a form 
of propaganda and as an agent of 
political reform for issues of signif-
icance to the Mexican community. 

Sometimes referred to as gueril-
la Ihearer, the first realros (such as 
Tearro Call/pesino, Tealro Mesrizo 
and Tea/ro Esperanza) developed 
in the 1960s during the Mexican 
labor strikes led by Cesar Chavez. 
The work of these groups presented 
powerful statements of the pain and 
hope of the Mexican people living 
and working in the United States. 

One of the most important ele-
ments of a rearro is its ability to 
reflect the corazon of its people, 
including both the surface-level 
laughter and the tears that are 
found deep within the heart. 

Flores describes this genre of 
theater as "un espejo ... It 's a mirror 
reflecting the issues and feelings of 
our people. We don't answer to 
critics, we're the voice of our peo-
ple and we answer to our people." 

Among the many 
luues raised are 
the concepts of 
Illegal Immigration, 
deportation, 
Mexican culture, 
recognRlon and 
acceptance of 
cuRure, labor strike 
dlfflcuRles, the 
Vietnam war, 
Mexican-
American/Chicano 
studies In higher 
education and the 
separation of 
families. 

Because of their appeal to the 
people, lealros have been per-
formed at various venues ranging 
from field strikes to prisons and the 
barrios, and tonight UCSD is being 
added to the list. 

"La Victima" was written and 
rewritten as a collective by Tealro 
Esperanza in the late 19705, and is a 
reflectiqn of an immigrant Mexican 
family 's complex struggle to find a 
new and better life in the United 
States throughout the span of a few 

generations. It tells the story of 
Amparo Villa, a widow who is 
ultimately "Ia victima," or "the 
victim" of immigration problems. 

Aside from immigration diffi-
culties and living with a stub-
born, ill husband, Amparo's life is 
further complicated by the resur-
gence of a painful pa t, which 
includes the separation from her 
first son on a train ride to Mexico. 

Originally written and per-
formed in Spanish, Teatro Tla -
quelzque has translated the text 
into English, keeping a bit of 
Spanish slang mixed in for 
extra flavor. Among the 
many issues raised are the 
concepts of illegal immigra-
tion, deportation, Mexican 
culture, recogmtlOn and 
acceptance of culture, labor 
strike difficulties, the Vietnam 
war, Mexican-American/Chi-
cano studies in higher education 
and the separation of families. 
Although the issues are Chi-
cano-specified, the story line 
and themes of the play are easi-
ly understood and applicable to 
all , regardless of ethnicity. 

Tealro Tlaquerzque's perfor-
mance of "La Victima" is being 
sponsored by UCSD MEChA 
(Movimiento Estudiantil Chi-
cano de Aztlan) and will begin 
tonight at 7 p.lll . ;n Peterson 
Hall 110.

MARRIAGE VOWS THAT EXPLORE ARTISTIC VALUES 
In (Tending the Keep' Sawako Nakayasu combines cultural oddities and concerns with performance art 
By Uncluy Sworskl 
Senior Staff Writer 

There are many people who 
aren't familiar with the term "per-
formance art." Not to be confused 
with "the performing arts," perfor-
mance art is one of the most fluid 
and expansive art forms today, uti-
lizing elements from all types of 
expression. 

Performance art. encompasses 
all of the traditional art forms 
(dance, spoken and written text, 
visual an, acting, etc.) though it 
often combines them in unfamiliar 
layers and take them far beyond 
the basic boundaries. A painting 
lasts fore.ver and a play can be pro-
duced again. But each production 
of a performance art piece exists 
only in the present, and becomes an 
encompassing experience for 
everyone involved. 

Soooo, speaking of performance 
an. there is going to be a wonderful 
set of pieces performed this week-
end at Sushi Perf0rmance and 
Visual An downtown. The anist is

titled "Tending the Keep" or 
"Improbable weddings for red-
eyed believers." Like all good per-
formance art, the experience is both 
immediate and abstract. Peculiari-
ties of day-to-day life are explored 
while fulfilling deep thematic and 
aesthetic goals. 

Sawako questions-the role of an 
in commercialized society, the 
audience's personal concerns 
(which they have written down on 
a piece of paper for her before the 
show) and the oddities of our cul-
ture 's rituals and events - all 
while in the height of humor. 
Watch out for confused hockey 
goalies tending their keep. 

In regard to her art, Sawako 
explains, "As for what I find valu-
able, I think it's importllnt for people 
to marry .... if not someone, then 
something. I am marrying art, and [ 
am marrying people to my art. I 
think that human interaction is 
important ... and am concerned 
about our cell-phone-pager-instant-
communication culture that we are 
developing. I feel the need to oppose 

and this is the medium r am using." 
"Tending the Keep," among other 

things, refers to tending to the things 
that we hold most valuable and 
endearing. The term "goaltenders" 
and "goalkee~r.;" carry both the lit-
eral issue of protecting the home 
ground and the thematic view of 
guarding personal space. Yet Sawako 
skillfully plays with movement, 
props and meaning as much as she 
plays with words. 

Sawako is a San Diego compo -
er, poet, singer and dancer, in addi-
tion to performance artist. She grad-
uated from UCSD two years ago 
with a B.A. in Music Composition 
and in LiteraturelWriting. Except for 
Alicia Marvan, all of the performers, 
including Julius Ferrer, Elena 
Bernardi , Marcia Scott, and Janie 
Lee (violin) all go to UCSD. Sup-
pon your fellow studenb, 
try something new, 
and see some per-
formance an all in 
one fell swoop. 

''Tending the 
Keep" or "Improb-

Joan of Arc 
How Memory Works 

-,-
-**** 

In How Memory Works, listeners 
are justified in comparing the whin-
ing, screeching vocals to the tyle 
of college-favorite Ween. Decep-
tively soft lyrics on "A Party Able 
Model Of' may trickle out like holy 
water, but most of the time this 
album makes you want to find the 
horse that the lead singer is tortur-
ing and put it out of its misery. 

Fluid instrumental work ("So 
Open; Hooray!"), multiple vocal 
overlays and an occasional lapse into 
electronic noodling ("Osmosis Does-
n't Work") provide a welcome dose 
of personality in the already over-
crowded alterna-tronica market. 
However, loan of Arc seem to be on 
the wrong page. Just when the band 
suggests a moment of unbridled 
aggression, it instead settles back into 
a mellow conventionality that so 
many forgettable bands utilize. The 
vocals may be unique, but the final 
product is just about as ground-break-
ing as the opening of another GAP. 

- Jeremy Gray 

Joydrop 
Metasexual 
,-.., .... 

-*** 
. Joydrop is so inoffensi ve that 

it's the equivalent of the Saltine 
crackers of the riot-grrl bands -
good for snacking, bad for sub-
stance. Groups like Elastica, 
Garbage and - to an extent -
Lush, have all proliferated from 
emotion with an edge ... the stuff 
that narrows in on the source of tor-
ment and extends a big middle fin-
ger salute. loydrop, however, 
would rather talk things out. 

That 's just one of the things that 
makes Metasexual so damn frus-
trating. The lyrics have plenty of 
depth, yet lead singer Tara Slone 
recites them like a third-rate 
spelling bee contestant. For every 
"fizz," where she's clearly in her 
element (bland gml punk), there's 
"no one," which is the audio equiv-
alent of Shirley Manson singing the 
final slow song at the senior prom. 

There's nothing horrible about 
loydrop, but there's nothing spec-
tacular, either.

,.."'" bJ Natur. 
Nineteen Naughty Nine: Nature 's Fury 

--
-**** 

Has it been that long? Yep, this 
is Naughty's first release since 
Poverty's Paradise in 11)95. This 
time around, the vibrantly clear and 
positive lyrics ofTreach and Vinnie 
(Vin Roc) saturate the album with 
classic Naughty flavor, making lis-
teners recall memories of "O.P.P." 
and "Hip Hop Hooray." 

Kaygee still bangs tracks out 
behind the boards, but the matured 
style has sacrificed some of the 
original rawness for an eclectic 
menagerie of winding, dirty beats. 
The biggest fault that Naughty by 
Nature make on this album is an 
attempt to "over-modernize" their 
style. 

The featured guest list is impres-
sive, but in the end, detracts from the 
overall quality of the album. 

RecruiL~ include Master P and Co., 
Big Pun, Krayzie Bone, Zhane and 
Next, all of whom inject too much of 
their individual flavors . Guests 
aside, the pure Naughty joints shine.

Score 

--
-*** 

It would be too easy to dub it 
"fusion"; the Paul Haslinger 
album Score categorizes itself as 
"rare groove/urban/lounge/cine-
fi/fringe-pop.-" The album title and 
rich graphics suggest that it is a 
kind of film score for modem life; 
the songs are indeed melting pots 
of global musical ideas. 

The third song on Score is 
close to standard pop, but it 
stands as a thesis for the whole 
album. The only song with lyrics, 
"When Worlds Collide" inte-
grates female vocals in a minor 
key with ethnic instruments and 
background vocals. The rest of 
the album expresses ideas musi-
cally about culture clash, mixing 
Eastern, Middle Eastern, African 
and South American tribal instru-
ments and vocals with Jazz solos 
on a distinctly Western base. 
Classical orchestral instruments 
are delicately 'woven through the 
huge quilt of music, generally 
organized around dancy rhythms 

Thursday, May 6, 1999 

and the occasional electric guitar. 
The resulting Western. influence 
never overwhelms the ethnic 
sound, but channels songs along 
paths familiar enough to be pleas-
ing. 

Haslinger, though he combines 
elements of dance and world 
music, stretches past groups like 
Enigma and Deep Forest due to his 
vast diversity. The many sampled 
sounds are used inventively, with 
creative interpretations of jazz, 
funk and dance themes, as opposed 
to mere repetition. 

The infusion of multiple styles 
and genres might make this album 
foreign to the general public but the 
improvised rhythms and ambient 
musical selection will be an inter-
esting treat for those who enjoy 
experimental music at one of its 
purest forms.

THE MEMORY WALL 
UCSD to host a UC system-wide Dance Festival this weekend 
By Hannah GrIffIth 

Staff Writer 
In yet one more example of the 

continuing expansion of UCSD's 
dance program, the university will 
host '1'he Memory Wall" dance fes-
tival this weekend. Interested stu-

• dents will have the opportunity to 
attend classes, lectures and perfor-
rnances from 11:00 a.m. Friday to 
2:30 p.m. Sunday. 

Many well-known artists' will be 
offering classes and lectures during 
the festival. Carla Maxwell, the artis-
tic director of the Jose Limon Dance 
ComPany, has been guest-teaching 
scheduled modem dance classes on 
campus since Monday, and will offer 
both classes and a discussion. 

Acclaimed San Francisco artist 
Kim Epifano, who choreographed a 
piece in last quarter's "An Evening 
of Dance," will offer classes in com-
position and in post-modem dance. 

Guest speakers include Donald 
McKay Ie, who has choreographed 
for Alvin Ailey, and Ellen Siegel and 
recently published a book about 
modem dance pioneer Martha Gra-
ham. Numerous UCSD faculty will 
also be offering classes. 

In addition, the renowned Jose 
Limon Dance Company will perform 
in Mandeville Auditorium on Friday 
at 8:00 p.m. Although Limon himself 
passed away years ago, his legacy 
lives on in his company and in the 
influence his technique continues to 
have on modem dance, including the 
vocabulary of UCSD professors. 

The performance will include 
'1'he Winged," a dance about various 
types of birds and animals, both real 
and mythical, that can fly. Some 
UCSD students have already experi-
enced this performance as Maxwell 
taught the beginning of it in dance 
classes this week. 

For those who cannot attend the 
Friday evening performance, the 
company's technical rehearsal will 
be free and open Lo the public from 
3:00 to 6:00 p.m. on Friday. Anyone 
interested is encouraged to attend. 

"It's g "" when peor,: come to 
rehearsal," said a company member. 
"I like it because I'm more motivated 
to dance if there's somebody watch-
ing." 

Saturday night there ~i11 be a per-
. formance by students from UC cam-

puses at Berkeley, Irvine and Santa 
Barbara, as well as UCSD. 

Excluding the Jose Limon Dance 
Company's performance, all events 
are free and will take place in the 
new dance building, which is located 
between the Mandel Weiss Center 
and the Che Cafe. 

For information call UCSD 
Dance Coordinator Patricia Rincon 
at 534-4369.

14 IDAnJS 

By John Barber 
Senior Staff Writer 

Alan Moore is, shall we say, a 
weird man. . 

He's best known for writing 
comic books, especially Watchmen 
(one of the most widely acclaimed 
comics of the '80s) and From Hell 
(an intense examination of the Jack 
the Ripper murders that interprets 
them as a metaphor for the 20th cen-
tury). Moore's also something of a 
magician; not a pulling-rabbits-
from-a-hat magician, but an Alestair 
Crowley communicating-with-
elder-gods type. He also looks some-
thing like Charles Manson, and by 
all accounts, smokes a lot of hash. 

So it's probably not surprising 

The UCSD OuInIian ThursdaY. May 6, 1999 

IT'S WEIRD MAN, REALLY WEIRD 
David]., Alan Moore and Tim Perkins produce the weirdest CD ever created 
that I can safely call The Moon and 
Serpent Grand Egyptian Theatre of 
Marvels - and I do not use these 
words lightly - the weirdest 
record I've ever heard. 

In 1994, coinciding with the 
day that comet crashed into Jupiter, 
Moore gave a (mostly) spoken 
word performance backed by taped 
music from David J (of 
BauhauslLove and Rockets) and 
percussionist Tim Perkins. The 
results were released a few years 
later by Cleopatra Records, and 
those results are bizarre, bone chill-
ing and often pretty funny. 

The record begins with Moore 
singing as a carnival-huckster, 
entreating the listener to joi n the 
Theatre of Marvels, promising thrills 
and chills, freaks and gods. Then he 
moves into the spoken word. 

I know spoken word is some-
thing of a turn-off for most; I admit 
it's a trick to do well. Still, don't let 
that scare you off from this album. 
Moore's English-accented voice 
carries the unmetered, unrhymed 
reading both conversationally and 
pleasantly. 

He starts by describing idea 
space - a world of "pure 

escapes from 
Russia into China. 

metaphor" where the houses of 
your childhood appear side by side 
as you think about them; where the 
north and south poles are adjacent 
when you consider them together. 
This is clearly the world where 
Moore spends most of his hours. 

Moore's talk leads us into a 
recounting of a London tour he 
took for a British TV documentary. 
He gives us all of the most para-
noid bits from From Hell; 
Whitechappell's churches and 
obelisks as physical manifestations 
of Masonic plots and "convenient 
atrocities. " 

Then Moore summons a god via 
underground cartoonist Melinda 
Gebbie. 

Yeah, it gets weird; Gebbie 
(who collaborated with Moore on 
the comics Lost Girls and Supreme) 
chirps and babbles as "the Enochi-
an Angel of the seventh Aethyr" 
greets us mortals. This turns into a 
chant: 'There's no such thing as 
magic, there's no such thing as 
magic .... " A final song finishes the 
recording. 

Man, I hate saying "weird" this 
much --:- it 's an irritating and not 
very descriptive word. But still, the 

Theatre of Marvels is. Weird, I 
mean. 

Nonetheless, the music is 
incredible; Perkins and David J 
switch brilliantly between acting as 
background noise for Moore's 
reading and becoming a loud and 
terrifying foreground, all depend-
ing on what the mood calls for. The 
words and music work together as 
well as the words and pictures do in 
Moore's comics; that is to say, he 
makes the nearly impossible look 
utterly effortless. 

The most impressive moment of 
music is when Moore takes us to 
meet Glycon, the "last created of 
the Greek gods." David 1's part 
seems to be tape-manipulated 
chimes, but the effect - perfectly 
echoing Moore's description of a 
purely mathematical beauty -
sounds like hyperdimensional digi-
tal liquid. 

The Theatre of Marvels is a 
soul-searing journey. It's an experi-
ence every time I hear it - which, 
to be honest, isn't really all that 
often, because it is such an experi-
ence. This is not a record to put on 
while you're typing a report or ... 
well, doing just about anything, 

really. This is a record to really lis-
ten to, and ... well, I'm just getting 
too spiritual here to sound credible. 

But don't misunderstand: 
Moore doesn't ask the listener to 
believe that he's "really" sum-
moned a god; he asks the listener to 
believe in the power of metaphor, 
to believe (in an oft-quoted line of 
his) that "all stories are true" and to 
carry the deepest meaning of that 
phrase into real life. 

Moore's idea-space universe of 
thoughts made physical, of cen-
turies-old conspiracies crossing 
millennia-old deities crossing mod-
em cities, all in a low-class carni-
val, is a great place to visit - if 
you can let yourself. 

Moore also collaborated with 
Perkins and David J on an album 
called The Birth Caul, which is 
being turned into a comic by 
Moore and his Fro.m Hell collabo-
rator Eddie Campbell. Both records 
are fairly difficult to find in stores, 
though they are available through 
http://www.amazon.com!under 
"David J." . 

And honestly, both of 'em are 
pretty good for being from, you 
know, a weird guy.

CHi: 
Cafe hosts three 
shows a week 
ContInued from ...... 

In esscnce, the Che Cafe is a 
non-hierarchical, non-profit co-op. 
Basically. it is a collection of stu-
dent and interested youth who work 
together without the burdensome 
impersonal relationship that occurs 
between employers and employees. 
They are responsible only to each 
other, the people they serve and the 
terms of the lease that keep them 
functioning as a political and social 
co·op/musical venue/vegan cafe on 
the UCSD campus. 

There aren't many at the 
moment - eight dedicated mem-
bers and a number of volunteers 
that vary according to what is hap-
pening on a particular night. and all 
brand new to the tremendous 
responsibility of running the Che 
effectively. 

Nonetheless, the Che has been a 
necessary supplement to my educa-
tion. Learning how to work in a 
cooperative atmosphere. communi-
cating and communing with peers. 
taking responsibility and basically 
liguring out how to run a "busi-
ness" that serves the needs of stu-
dents seeking alternatives to what 
the rest of the campus has to offer 
(fast food drivel and washed up, 
has-been, mainstream radio acts). 
has had a profound effect on every-
one involved. 

At college, experimentation 
goes beyond what one does in a lab 
coat or in the bathroom during a frat 
party. College should be an adven-
ture in seeking out new thoughts 
and opinions, as well as a medium 

through which one breaks out of the 
comfortable constructs that one 
may have grown accu tomed to 
during high school. The CM Cafe is 
my refuge from a conservative city 
run by a capitalistic government. 

Currently, the Che Cafe is host-
ing all-you-can-eat dinners every 
Thursday between 5:30 and 7:30 
p.m. Stop by to experience some 
tasty home-cooked vegan food. 
meet lots of interesting people and 
even hear music! Volunteers are 
welcome between the times 01'2:30 
and 5:30 p.m. for prep and 7:30 to 
8:30 p.m. for clean-up. 

The Che also hosts aOout three 
musical shows a week, give or take 
a few. Most bands are of the indie 
rock, hemo" or hardcore genre, 
with the occasional punk/pop/alter-
native show popping up. 

Again. this is another opportuni-
ty to volunteer and admission is 
free. Just show up before 8:00 p.m. 
and stick around until clean-up 
(warning: some restrictions apply). 

Call 534-2311 for enlighten-
ment. or visit the web site at 
illlp://come.lO/cilecafe or 
illlfJ://burn.ucsd.edul-checafe. 

The Che is a haven for all who 
are open-minded and politically 
active - an arena from which you 
may learn information not available 
from your current courses. It is open 
for all to glean a unique and positive 
experience from their college years.

1Wo Seniors Departing 
ADIOS: Two bid adieu to Triton women's soccer team 
By Jake Gordon 
Sports Editor 

Not many college athletes get to win a 
national championship. and even fewer 
ever get a chance to win back-to-back 
titles. UCSD, however, is an athlete 's 
Mt!cca, where national championships 
tlow like wine. And this year 's seniors 
have seen their fair share. 

The UCSD women's soccer team is 
bidding adieu to two seniors who have 
won not just one or two national titles, but 
three in only four years. 

Seniors Alison Hurley and Shelbi 
Thiele have been blessed with athletic 
prowess and good timing, enabling them 
to compete on one of the biggest dynasties 
in UCSD sports: the three-peat National 
Championship from 1995-1997. 

Hurley, a 5'5" forward from Poway, 
Calif., has been at UCSD for five years. 
Amazingly, she almost witnessed four 
national championships as she was red-
shirted in 1994 when the Tritons lost to 
Trenton State in the title game. A 
hard worker, Hurley epitomized 
aggressi veness and deter-
mination for the Tritons """"0.:= ....... 
in her four years. Her 
competitive spirit and attitude 
rubbed off on her teammates. 

"Alison was an overachiever. She made 
the absolute most of her speed and her 
ability," Head Coach Brian McManus said. 
"She was a very hard competitor who 
never gave up on a ball and would run

Unlike Hurley, Thiele, a 5'6" midfield-

er fro~ West Hills, Calif., was a quieter 
intluence in the clubhouse. Yet, her skill 
on the field was apparent as she helped her 
team attain the three national titles. 

"Shelbi was quiet by nature, but she 
let her skills do the talking," 
McManus said. "She was a 
little underrated and not 

noticed, but that's what good play-
er do. They get the job done and help the 
team. That 's the kind of player she wa ." 

As these players leave UCSD, they can 
take satisfaction in their collegiate careers . . 
Not many players can claim such success, 
but Hurley and Thiele deserve it. 

Farewell To Three 
, 

AU REVIOR: Volleyball team loses three senior leaders 
By John Maynard 
Sports Editor 

UCSD women 's volleyball Head 
Coach Duncan McFarland is facing a chal-
lenging task. Next season, the team will 
have three huge pairs of shoes to fill. 

On December 5, the Tritons took part in 
NCAA Division III National 
Championships in Huntington, Pa., where 
they battled toe-to-toe for five games 
before eventually losing to Central 
College (IA). This close loss not only 
capped off another remarkable season, but 
it also marked the end of a great legacy for 
the UCSD women's volleyball team. 

That heart-breaking defeat also meant 
the departure of three invaluable seniors: 
Katherine Brynjestad, Shannon Noonan 
and Dana Salter. On the bench, on the 
court and during practices, this trio was 
integral to the team's success last fall. 

The year after leading their team to 
National Championships, the Tritons 
pieced together another marvelous season, 
going 26-5 overall, 21 -4 against Division 
III schools and became practically unbeat-
able on their own court. These seniors 
were there every step of the way. 

Brynjestad consistently made her pres-
ence felt as one of the Tritons' best outside 
hitters. She packed an enormous punch, and 
more times than nOl, blasted kills through 
opponents' blocks. This fall, the 5'11" 
senior racked up 202 kills and dished 
up 36 service aces - third 
best on t he squad. .....,II"ft':"Z"lI 

Noonan was best 
known for getting the crowd into the 
game. Her endless drive and tenacity real-
ly came to life during close matches when 
the Tritons were down. She was the back-
bone of many Triton comebacks this year. 
Like Brynjestad, Noonan's statistics are 
impressive. In total, the senior middle-
blocker had 174 kills, 11 service aces, 100 
digs and teamed up for 46 blocks.

NoonM: 
Big prescence in 
the middle, she 
dominated at the 
net and 
envigorated the 
crowd with her 
monster kills. 

The last pair of shoes McFarland will 
have to fill next season are Salter's. Such a 
pair is few and far between. 

Salter was one of the most positive and 
outspoken leaders on the squad. The senior 

seller had a solid serve and her athleti-
cism was unparalleled. As 
one of the team's most con-
sistent servers this year, she 

brought in 35 service aces. 
The Tritons may say goodbye to an out-

standing trio of seniors when graduation 
rolls around this June, but a solid group of 
returners fortified by a promising recruit-
ing class means the women's volleyball 
team will continue to roll next fall. 
Brynjestad, Noonan and Salter can rest 
assured - their shoes will be filled.

The Greatest Sports 
Road Trip Ever 

Sit down for a second kids. 
Let's think about all of the won-
derful times together. I've been 
burping my pointless, non-sensi-
ble dri vel onto these pages for 
quite awhile now, and for some 
reason, you guys keep reading it. 

As we all know, the gut has 
had some rather epic sports cel· 
ebrations. I told you guys about 
the NFL Draft, where all my 
friends and I do is si t on the 
couch for close to 14 hours 
watching a DRAFf. not even a 
sporting event. I fooled some of 
you into believing that the gut 
was some kind of super hero. 

I have also told war stories 
of gambling in Las Vegas. And 
hell , there have been countless 
columns about how I was fat 
and drunk and saw something 
really cool on ESPN that I 
thought all you guys should 
know. But after all of that, I still 
need more sports. However, I 
think my roommates and I have 
actually found the ultimate way 
to celebrate sports: A ROAD 
TRIP! (and you thought I was 
about to get sent\mentaLon you, 
huh?) 

That's right, coachers and 
coachelles, by the grace of 
Bucket 's kind-hearted mother, 
this summer, Buckel, a couple 
of our other, fatter friends and I 
are gelling off the couch, into a 
minivan and onto the road. It 
took us a while to convince each 
other that getting off the couch 
was a good idea, but somehow, 
we did it. The result is a base-
ball stadiumlHall of Fame tour 
of this great nation . 

You name it: Wri gley, 
Comiskey, Fenway, Tiger, 
Yankee, Shea, Jacobs, Three 
Ri vers, Camden, Arlington, 
Canton and Cooperstown are all 
on our list, plus seemingly 
countless others. As far as I can 
tell , its going to be the si ngle 
greatest trip of all time. 

Basically, it 's going to be 
four guys li vi ng the dream of 
every . other sports fan . Yeah, 
yeah, we're going to see all the 
required stuff like Old Faithful, 
Mt. Rushmore and the deep 
south, but we're going to hustle 
through that stuff - we've got 
games to get to! 

~e're so serious about this 
that as of now, seeing our 
nation's capi tal i off the agen-
da. We' ll be in Baltimore for an 
Oriole,game, so we figure that 's 
close enough. Just picture it: 
We' re goi ng to be bathing in 
Schlitz suds in Mil waukee. 
We're going to throw the other 
team's ball back with the 
Bleacher Bums in Wrigley. 
Then we'll all go across 
Waveland Avenue in search of 
sports bars and bratwurst.

The last warmup meet before Conference Championships proves that the future looks bright for UCSD 

Estella Villacorta/Guatdlan 
DI. In: UCSD runner Steve Smith (center) works hard to claim victory in the 400 meter dash. 

By Bill Burg.r 
Senior Staff Writer 

With the UCSD-hosted 
California-Nevada 
Championships only a memory 
and the all important CCAA 
Championships looming two 
weeks away, you might expect that 
the Triton track team would have 
had a hard time preparing for the 
Steve Scott Invitational. 

But preparation was not a prob-
lem for UCSD as it traveled up to 
Irvine to compete in one of the 
year 's most competitive meets. The 

meet attracted athletes from 
Divisions I, II and III and from as 
far away as Great Britain. As if the 
team needed any more motivation, 
the Steve Scott Invitational, which 
took place last Sunday, was the last 
warm-up before the Conference 
Championships. 

With this in mind, the Triton 
athletes went out and had one of 
their best overall perfol'JTlances of 
the year, showing that they are 
peaking at just the right time. 

One outstanding performance 
was turned in by Jessica Shugart 

in the 200 meters. Her time of 
25.44 seconds was a personal best 
and also the third best time turned 
in by a UCSD athlete in school 
history. Shugart, who ran a school 
record time in the 400 meter hur-
dles last week, has consistently 
put up solid times and appears to 
be ready for the conference cham-
pionships. 

Another impressive perfor-
mance was also turned in by 
sophomore Cindy Dostalek in the 
100 meter hurdles. In spite of hav-
ing a tom meniscus, Dostalek 

tumed in a personal best time of 
16.66 seconds, which was also the 
sixth best time in school.history. 

"The track was pretty fast and the 
weather was really nice for Irvine," 
Dostalek said. "Everyone is at their 
peak right now because of training all 
year and knowing that conference is 
coming up." 

On the men's side, Mark 
Meskimen solidified his spot as the 
Triton's top javelin thrower with a 
throw of 54.00 meters. That throw 
was good enough for 12th place at 
the meet, a personal best and also the 
eighth longest throw in school histo-
ry. 

Head coach Ted Van Arsdale said 
he was impressed with the perfor-
mance of his team on Sunday. 

"I was very pleased with the -per-
formances of everybody we took," 
Van Arsdale said. "The caliber of ath-
lete was very high and that con-
tributed to the outstanding perfor-
mances." 

Van Arsdale said he was particu-
larly impressed with the perfor-
mance of Lilian Liu in the triple 
jump, Phong Long in the long jump 
and Lynne Brinkman in the javelin. 
Long came off of a six-week injury 
to post a personal best jump of 6.82 
meters. Liu, who had been injured 
for most of the season, posted an 
excellent jump of 34'11" . 
Brinkman, a freshman javelin 
thrower, has been out for the last 
two meets but fought back on 
Sunday to post a throw of 34.94 
meters, good enough for sixth place. 

This impressive performance was 
good news for the Tritons, as they try 
to ride the emotional high into the 
Conference Championship meet. The 
CCAA championships, possibly the 
biggest meet of the year, will be host-
ed by UCSD on Friday, May 14 and ' 
Saturday, May 15. Mark those dates 
on your calendar and get ready to 
cheer the UCSD tracksters to victory. 

Tritons Win One, Lose One in Nationals 
CLOSE: UCSD beats Mary Washington College in first round, loses to undefeated Amherts in quarters 
By Jake Gordon 
Sports Editor 

Everyone makes guarantees in 
sports. Most of them, however, are 
wild claims. Phoenix Coyotes' Head 
Coach Jim Schoenfeld guaranteed 
victory against the St. Louis Blues in 
game seven of their Stanley Cup 
playoff series, but the 'yOles lost 1-0 
in aT. There is one coach with the 
foresight to correctly guarantee a 
victory, however - UCSD women's 
tennis Head Coach Liz LaPlante. 

laPlante guaranteed a victory 
in the first round of the NCAA 
Division III Championships in 
Ewing, N.J., but after that she 
would make no more predictions. 
Very wise, indeed. 

Seeded at fifth place, UCSD 
easily beat Mary Washington 

College of Virginia 7-2 on Tuesday 
in the first round, yet lost to unde-
feated Amherst College 6-3. The 
first-round victory was much 
like LaPlante had predicted. 
Yet, she knew the match 
against Amherst 
College would be a 
bailIe. The Jeffs 
knocked the Tritons 
out of the championships 
last year with a 9-0 drub-
bing. UCSD fought long and hard 
against this year's Amherst squad, 
which had won 17 in a row this sea-
son, but could not pull the upset. 
Yet the Tritons clearly improved 
from last year and ended their sea-
son with no regrets. 

Against Amherst, No. 3 
Lyndsay Tadlock won a tough 

match 5-7, 7-6, 6-2 while No. 4 
Yen-Yen Ho also won 7-6, 6-2. Yet 
these were the only bright spots in 
the match. 

The loss to Amherst was 
unfortunate because 

UCSD seemed so 
strong against 
Mary Washington. 
Losing only two 

matches, the Tritons clear-
ly dominated the Eagles. 

No. I Olsen barley I" t her 
match 6-3, 7-5 and then 'he Tritons 
got down to business. No. 2 
Nguyen battled back to win her 
match 7-6, 6-2, while No. 3 
Tadlock won a close one, 7-5, 6-3. 
No 4. Ho then demolished her 
opponent 6- I, 6-0. Rachel Gunther 
and Becky Jones also claimed vic-

tories for UCSD. 
Doubles has notoriously been 

UCSD's weakness, but it didn' t 
show against Mary Washington. 
The No. I Olsen-Tadlock combina-
tion won easily 8-2 and the No.3 
duo of Jones and Jennifer Drimmer 
helped claim the point for UCSD. 

Despite the loss in team compe-
tition, Nguyen had to be pleased. 
She still has a chance to compete in 
both the individual and doubles 
portion of the championships. Off 
the court, she was recognized as the 
west region winner of the Arthur 
Ashe SportsmanshiplLcadership 
Award, given for outstanding con-
tributions to her team, college and 
community. The senior leader guid-
ed her team to an outstanding year 
and she deserves the recognition.
