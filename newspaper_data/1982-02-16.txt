Co-ops: A part of the 60's in the 80's 
Fifteen years ago, it was not 

uncommon for a colle~e student to 
drop out of "the system' and look for 
an alternative lifestyle. 

Sometimes young people found 
satisfaction , but more often they 
found themsleves part of ill·fated 
communes and collectives which 
lasted no longer than the early 1970's. 
And often these young people ended 
up joining "the system" again . 

RIll whM became of those vou nll 
people who - f:ven though the fads of 
the 1960' had faded - till prefered to 
shu n 'capita li sm', competition , 
shallow mindednes , a nd in a word, 
all those thi ng. that wer associated 
with established society? 

One answer: they JOIned a co-
opera tive 

The idealism and naIvete associated 
with thp co-ooeratives of thp 19110's is 
not lacking at the Che Cafe, a 
vegetar ian restaurant co-operative on 
the UCS lJ campus. Instead , 

~ometh ing ha been added: a sense of 
the orartiral and an abilitv to survive. 

The Che Cafe, formed almo t two 
years ago, i more than urviving 
fi nancially, it is thriving, according to 
co-operative members. 

And this financial solvency has 
allowed Che members to achieve their 
two goals: to serve vegetarian health 
food, and most of all, to establIsh a 

cultural forum for progres 'Ive politics 
and avant-garde art. 

"It's a regular ambiente 
(atmosp here),like thev sav in 

panish," . ays Mark , a co:op mc'mber 
who i also a T.A. in the lIterature 
department. 

In fact, most co-op mem rs, lIke 
Mark, accredit thi. atmosphere for 
the Che's uccess. 

" I think it (a co-operative) creates-
just as the name implies - a co-
operative atmosphere where people 
don 't feel like they're always under 
the control of someone else. The 
people that work here are generally 
really involved with the Che and 
believe in what we're doing. I think 
we've got a lot of good energy here. 
The people who work here all 
contribute to that energy and make it 
grow," says Jessie, who book keeps for 
the Che. 

"While were not dirty, we throw 
things out in an uncontrived way," 
s ays Mark. "'Okay, we'll put thi s out 
here and we'll hand paint a sign that 
s ays sugar, instead of buying a sign .' 
It's easier to go that route and people 
like it. It s hows that the people behind 
counter are working for you . 

Like mos t co-operatives, the Che 
doesn 't offer to make its member 
rich. It i this co-operative atmosphere 
that Che members s tronllly feel keep 
members going. After all, working in a 
restauran t IS never ea y work_ 

At one point las t yea r, core 
members, tho e workers with the 
mo t experience, were only earning 
50¢ an hour, according to Jes e 

Bu t. offers Patrice, a ~tead\ C. he 
worker, "The main thing IS thai most 
people who come here to \\.ork, get to 
think of it a. their friends' place. Jt\ 
like a commuOItv." 

"*'''' 

An Integral part of the Che's 
atmosphere is a political consCIOUs-
ness. 

"W 're filling a political niche ju t 
a an animal fill ' an ecological niche," 
say Je se. "Without the Che there 
would be a vacuum in left·oriented 
politIC on campu ." 

Most of the Che' politics are not 
only left in orientation but also anti-
imperialistic in nature. 1ndicitive of 
thi i the fact that the cafe wa 
named after Che Guevara, a Cuban 
revolutionary who died combatting 
foreign intervention in South 
America . 

" At the time (of the Che' 
jnception), there wa an individual 
collective member who had ju t 
learned about Che Guevara and felt 
that the work he had been doing here 
embodied the struggle that Che was 
taking on in Latin America . 

*** 

Even though the Che worker are 
proud ot their cafe, they admIt that 
certain problems do ari e. 

Mo t Che member feel that UC 0 
t ud e nt often come from 

background which don 't prepare 
them to work in a co:operative. 

"I think that it's a struggle to come 
from an environment where you're 
trained to behave in a certain manner, 
and then to come into this alternative 
economic tructure and to actually be 
responsible for your action and be 
re pon ible to a group," offers Ahuva, 
a core mem ber. 

Adds ott, another core member, 
"One of the bigge t problems \\e've 
had here is the struggle again t 
liberahsm. '1 hate the System the wa\-
it IS so I'm going to go lIita the Che and 
do \\ hate\er I feel like doing." 

"..\ lot of u haw Il reallv well here 
at t he linker it\, better 'than most 
people In the· world' c()mment~ 
~'cott. "What \\ e're trYIng to achle\-c 
here i~ the ultimate compared to what

Che or in different co·op". Let'" ju~t 
not sa~ anything. Let's just let 
someone steal ,~5,OOO and not . a: 
anythIng .. 

But thi doe not mean that the 
workers of the Che aren t optlmLtic. 

When Juan, a core member wa ' 
a ked about the Che, he replied, "It' 
not Nirvahna - yet."

Glen and Shearer 

Commercial Rock 
Mu ic cnt lCS la t month 

mourned what may have been 
one of the worst years in the 
history of rock 'n' roll. 

What made 198] so bad? 
There is a strong consensus 
that no ingle album de. erves 
the accolade "Be t of 1981"; 
that the "po t-punk" sets in 
Los Angeles and ew York 
have subd ivided into an 
indi t ingui hable array of 
cults: that rock 'n' roll might 
as well dry up if young 
American continue to mimic 
mu ' IClan in "air guitar" 
competitions. 

Yet t he real "rock bottom" 
was precipitated Ie by the 
mu ic it elf than by those who 
helped finance it. Twenty 
year after the Rolling tones 
left a bohemian London hovel 
and first toured England, Mick 
Jagger took his band on a , 50 
million L'S tour paid for, in 
part, by a perfume company. 

The tones, whose latest 
album takes the name of a 
scent called "Tattoo," weren't 
alone in their use of a patron. 
Earth Wind & Fire is now 
'iponsored by Panasonic: Rod 

tewart's band is underwrit-
ten by ony: the rock group 
Orleans has a contract with 
Seagram's, and Charlie 
Daniel' si ngs for bot h Busch 
beer and Skoal chewing 
tobacco. The lIst of rock -
corporate deals is prodigious 
and growing. 

Rock 'n' roll ielling out. 
What' startling IS that no one 
seems to mind. 

Indeed, everyone seems to 
benefit: Rock starts tacitly 
endorse products such a<; beer, 
booze, chocolate and hi-fi 
equipment. Manufacturer.-
are permitted to mention the 
group's name in reference to 
theIr products. It 's a happy 
two-way street. MUSicians 
offset their own costs while 
adverti ers profit from the 

good words of young 
America's most trusted faces. 

Meanwhile, fans get more 
concerts, a well as a lovely 
full-color poster of the 
performing group, paid, for 
example, by RO RICO rum . 

"The idea of Madison 
Avenue getting involved with 
rock 'n' roll L relat ively new," 
aid Ja y Coleman, 31, 

pre ident of Rockbill. the 
Manhattan company , .... hich 
links rocker to bu. inessmen _ 
"The climate has changed 
radically since my generation 
identified going to concerts 
with their anti-war politics. 

ow people go to concerts for 
entertainment, not to make a 
poli tical s tatement." 

Rock 'n' roll's moorings to 
politics may have broken two 
years ago with the last of the 
.. 0 Nuke" concerts. ince 
then, rock artists ha"e shown 
very little enthusiasm for 
addressing - let alone 
acknowledging - more 
unplea"ant realities about the 
world in which the} operate. 

For an apolitical generation 
like ours. however, expression 
naturally takes on other 
cultural forms. And the values 
of rock 'n' roll undoubtedly 
still con titute much of the 
culture most young Americans 
absorb. 

All too many of our frienrls 
have mastered the tragic habit 
of consu ltingrock 'n' roll lyrics 
for guidance as other 
generations might have 
turned to the aphorisms of 
Thomas Wolfe, Tennyson or 
the Bible. Against a backdrop 
of often enormous profits, 
'iongwriters nonetheless 
preached t he gospel of the 
simple I ife . While everyone 
could see rock stars "suffered 
greatly" from their a tound -
ing affluence, fans took the 
lyrics as the word .

Pacific News Service 

New funding for schools 
By MARY ELLEN LEARY 

Pacific Nc\.\ s Sen,icc 
The Reagan administra· 

tion 's effort to privatize much 
of the nation 's public ector 
function' is gaining momen-
tum in some unexpected 
place ' - including the public 
school system . 

In California, particularly, 
private, non-profit tax-exempt 

foundation~ are being set up 
wi thi n ind i vid ual chool 
districts by ci tizens, not by 
school boards. to augment tax 
support for the pu blic schools. 
Thi s fa st-grow ing and 
spontaneous development is 
attracting attention across the 
nation_ Some claim it is the 
ine,'itable direction education 
must take if school are to 
maintain accustomed stan-
dard .. 

This willingness to pour 
private funds on top of taxes 
for school support is the single 
most "tnking aftermath of 
California's 1978 Proposition 
13 tax remit. Thirty-three of 
California's school districts 
now have citizen "education 
foundations," or are in the 
process of setti ng them up. 

Criticized at first a a frill 
suitable on ly for wea lthy 
districts seeking an allel na-
tive to private school s, the idea 
suddenl y is being embraced by 
middl - and even low-income 
areas, although the California 
system with the mo t 
problems, La Angeles, has not 
joined them. 

Two reasons prompt the 
unexpected wil lingness of 
Californians to donate 
hundreds or even thousands of 
dollar'i to their tax- upported 
school system . 

One is a shocked realization 
that dwindling tax money is 
pinching school program s 

unacceptab ly , just when 
parent concern and a new 
educational thru ·t put priority 
on sounder teaching in the 
"back-to-basics" movem ent. 
Tax cuts at the s tate leve l, as 
well as property tax cu ts 
I ally, have sharply curbed 
money for pu blic service, and a 
decline in federal money is 
expected next year. 

In addition, inflation and 
declining enrollment have 
crimped school budgets which 
are based on daily attendance 
factors. And California . chools 
contront t he extra adjustment 
of an income-eq ualizing factor 
ordered by the courts to make 
sure the . arne number of tax 
dollars stands behind every 
child, whether in a rich or po(ir 
neighborhood. This formula, 
at least through 1984, reduces 
state support for "wealthy" 
districts while enhancing the 
"poor." But no school claimto 
have enough to meet their 
needs. 

The second impetus to this 
"fou ndation " movement is the 
discovery among localities 
t hat when t he state took on the 
major responsibility for 
funding t he school sy terns 
after Propos ition 13, it also 
took over control. 0 room is 
left for a local community to 
make it ' own decis ions about 
innovation, special local needs 
or augmenting its teaching for 
the gift ed or the deprived. 
Funding is virtually all at the 
di scre tion of the state 
legis lature. 

Seeking bus ine s sector help 
for schols began with "Adopt a 
School" plan and efforts to 
win corporate gift for 
programs keyed to job needs. 
Glad ys Thacher, executive 
director of San Franci sco' 
Education Fund , was a 

rlassroom teacher in 1978 
with an assignment in "career 
education," which gave her 
contacts in t he business 
commun ity. That city had 
sized up its ' chool s hortcom-
ings with unusual insight 
after a "blue ribbon " 
com mittee in 1974-77 studied 
all aspects of local educat ion 
and came out with recommen-
dations for improvement, just 
as the bottom dropped out of 
tax support. 

The ready ar ray of targeted 
reforms caught the attention 
of the S. H. Cowell Foundation, 
and Thacher was a -s igned to 
write a grant application_ 
When themoneycame she was 
made executive director and 
today presides over a $.120,000 
an nual budg t which supports 
103 current programs. SInc(' 
beginning in 1979 , the 
foundat ion has raised about 
$700,000. 

Most school donor funds 
originate with worned and 
exasperated parents or 
dedicated school alums, or 
with school boards egging 
friend ly citizens into the act. 
Others, however, like an 
Franci co's, are triggered by 
teachers. In the little town of 
Benicia, the drive is led by 
former teacher Marilyn 
O'Rourke, who e enthusiasm 
about how the private sector 
cou ld help Benicia's school 
board and consequent ly 
ou ·ted from her teaching job. 

he volunteers now to get 
Benicia's foundation rolling. 

The an Francisco pattern 
for using funds differs from 
most other dis tricts, which 
simply hand the money to the 
school board, once the citizen 
group is persuaded its budget 
is tight and its need real. The

Vicious rumors of wildlife in La Jolla 
By DAVID TRAND 

I couldn't believe my 
Bushnell 8x40's. There it was, 
larger than any ord inary tabby 
and staring al me in whiskered 
annoyance. 0 the veiled 
whispers and mysterious 
rumor floating around the EI 
Torito-c1oned bars were true' 
There are bobcat (w II at last 
one) in the wild ' of La Jolla . 

One mall victory. [ thought 
as I nostalgically gazed at the 
dark condo-dotted quagmir ' 
surrounding th CD 
campus, which bring" me to 

t he point of thi s essay: it is 
amazing that anything wild 
and primitive still survives in 
our "sm ile and say stucco" 
environment. 

Usually an area begins to 
grow, and eventually shopping 
facilIties are developed to cater 
to the population. But it seems 
like someone r ally had plans 
for our little vall y as they 
built first fWD s hopping 
centers, and then began filling 
In th canyons with the 
fa!-.hionable "Villas Europas" 
and "La Jo ll a Pines" 

developments. Thank God 
someone had the guts to build 
affordable hou s ing for the 
nouveau-rich! Now my idea is 
to develop a Ihird shopping 
facility (we really need a 
Pennys!) right bet ween t he 
other two and ca ll it, for the 
'iak of auth nticity, Bobcat 
Country Mall, whi ch would 
the perfect cousin to the 
quaint Village Square and 
Town Centre optIOns wear so 
fond of. 

I'm wIllmg to admit hen> to a 

bit of ignorant blowing off 
about th iSl,ue of development 
in our community. I'dwelcom 
any information on how I or 
anyone ca n impact on the 
ituation we face. Is there a La 

Jolla planning committ ee? Do 
they care about strik ing a 
balance bet w en development 
a nd preservation? nfortu-
nately, the way I l ome 
aware that anoth r can yon is 
being" ivilized" is when the 
cad re of bu lldozers arri ve 
(looking h auntingl y like 
ca nary y Il ow Sherman tanks) 

and methodically pave over 
the rabbit holes, bird nests and 
bobcat hideouts in a matter of 
hours. 

It 's sad to see a fragile 
ecosy'tem that's operated for 
thousands uf years b 
destroyed wi th nary a for or 
aftert hought. Bolxat· in La 
Jolla? Sound like a vicIOUS 
rumor to me.

Hearings on Piper's law~uit 
over pesticide use continue 

By SCOTT YO NG 
Back in June. 1981 , UCSD 

pest controller David Piper 
was assigned to . pray the 
high l y toxic pe st ic ide 
"VosBan" inside the Primary 
Care Clinic at nivers it v 
Hospital. oting that the 
pesticide label did not 
authorize its use around 
ho pitals. Piper warned his 
supervisors at the Department 
of Custodial, Grounds and 
Transportation ervices. He 
was ignored and the spraylngs 
were not cancelled. 

Piper refused to spray, and 
as a result. he was placed on a 
four week invest igat ory leave. 
He lost 12 days of pay. had 
several lette r - citIng 
incomretence and insu bordi· 
nation placed in his files and 
was demoted to t he lower 
salar} position of grounds 
keeper. 

collection of problem sets . old 
tests, and lecture notes -
whIch was recently eliminated 
from campus libranes. 

Henrv Chu, Commis~lOner 
of Academic Affairs \\ ho 
presented the proposal to the 
council. would like to see 
xeroxed copies of the "soft 
re'lerves" sold at t he newly 
acq u i red lect ure not es of fice in 
the tudent Center complex. 

Chu believs the council will 
vote favorablv since the math 
and AME' departments 
support the proposal. 

If the program IS a success 
next quarter, the A. l'C D 
will expand the "soft 
reserves" services next year [0 

However, Piper's super-
"isor, Steven Pvles (with the 
help of an assIstant) did spray 
the pesticide - twice, In facl. 
Complaints by the Primary 
Care Clinic workers prompted 
the County Department of 
Food and Agriculture to 
investigate t he spraying. and 
p,les has since rec i\ed a 
not ice of \ lolat ion for u. 109 
"pesticides in conflict WIth the 
la I." 

More Serious Offense 
Although the Department's 

use of dangerous pesticides 
has been punIshed , a far more 
serious offense is no\\ belOg 
examined by a gne\'ance 
commIttee. In discriminating 
against Piper, the l'ni\'ersit~· 

ha~ brol$en t he law and is 
guilty of a mIsdemeanor.

American FederatIOn of . tate,

From a Staff Writer 
The Committee "C, " a 

urv ey and review team 
formed by Univer ity of 
California Pre ' iden t David 
Saxon, met privately in the 
UCSD chancellor's complex 
Thursday and Friday. 

The committee heard 
testimony from campus 
administrator, faculty 
member and student leader 
concerning general academic 
conditions at UCSD. 

"Saxon said that he would 
like us to visit the campuses to 
meet with faculty, students 
and administrators. and to 
report to him on the state of 
the campuses," said commit-
tee chairman Kivie Moldave. 

"And if there are things 
which are very good. such as 
the fact that on some 
campuses the facu Ity feel 
very, very po itive about the 
direction the campus ha 
taken in the la t few years, 
those (things) we'd tell him 
also, " Moldavesaid. "So it (the 
committee) i not just going to 
look for problems. We want to 
see how people perceive life on 
their campu . Each campu 
ha its own unique s tructure 
to it and so we would like to 
know if tho e (structures) 
happen to be working well. " 

Moldave aid. 
The administration . In 

general . wa unwilling to 
comment on what information 
was given to the committee. 
However, Jules Bagneri s, 
Associated Students presi-
dent, told the Guardian that he 
submitted the list of Third 
World demands which the 
"UCSD 34" made during their 
sit-in of the chancellor's office 
last Spring_ 

Bagneri commented that 
the Ii t of demands - which 
includes a request for the 
recrui tment and retention of 
more Third World professors 
and students - are "more 
essential (now) than they were 
in Spring because of he cuts in 
the institution of higher, " 
especially financial aid. 

Bagneris also submitted a 
proposal to enlarge the 
Studen t Center, and a requ est 
that campus radio station 
KSDT increase its broadcas-
ting capabilitie on campu . 

The Committee "c" i the

Alcoholics and alcoholism: an overview How to become 

an alcoholic BY JOE FALLETTA 
Senior Stall Writer 

More th a n two- third s of th e 
American male population drinks 
more than jus t occas ionall y, with an 
ave rage a nnu a l con s umpti on of 
absolute alcohol around 2.7 ga llons per 
pers on. The figure for women dri nkers 
is 'omewha t lower. wi th a male-fema le 
ratio of about 1.3: 1. 

Es timates how that between fi\'e 
and ten percent of adu lt males are 
alcoholic a t some time in their li\·es. 
Tra ns lated in to rea l terms, that comes 
out to approximately nine mIl lion men. 
And, while that numberfor women is a 
four t h that for men. the gap is dos ing. 

Those figures may be somewhat 
s tartling, es pecia ll y w hen \' iewed 
alongside society's more s tereo typica I 
image of the down-and-out wi no on 
. kid row li ving on handouts and cheap 
wine _ The picture, w hile qui te 
w ides pread , represen ts onl y five 
percent of that nine million , according 
to Dr. Marc A. Schuckit , director of 
re earch for the a lcohol treatment 
program at the Veterans Adminis tra-
tion Medical Center . 

Sc huckit expl a in the ave rage 
alcoholic is a " middle-class male in hi s 
forties who has show n som degree of 
stabilit y in his life up to the poin t of 
being diagnos ed an alcoholic . 

"The average alcohol ic has a job a nd 
a fa mil y a nd d r inks mostly on 
weekend s," he says. 

An alcoholic wi ll develop that first 
"major life problem" associa ted wi t h a 
drinking probl em in his la te twenties 
or earl y thi rties. chuckit add s. but 
w ill not btay d runk from that poin t on . 
Contrary to a nother myth, he says the 

course of the di sease is riddled w ith 
periods of time when he or s he IS dry 
and those when the a lcoholic drinks 
mode ra tely wit h no problems. 

At a ny given point in time, a fourt h 
or more of the a lcoholics wi ll be on th e 
wagon wi th some absta ining for 
months at a lime. Sch uckit wrote in, 
"Over view of Alcoholism." These 
per iods a lt erna t e with th()~e of 
dr inking moderately WIth no problem 
or apparent control of problems. 

" H ea\'ier drinking and the 
associated problems almost invariabl} 
fo llow," he adds. 

Methods of dIagnosis depend on 
whom yuu read or talk with. Schuckit, 
an au t hor of numerous books and 
articles on the topic, explainS one 
met hod deals w ith the amount 
consu med. the freq uency of use 'and 
th e pattern of drinking. Ot hers may 
defin e the disease according to degree 
o f ph ys i ca l or psyc h o logical 
dependence. 

Each method, however. suffers from 
Its own s hort comings, includi ng 
subject ivit y and mitigating factor s 
'uch a' age, weight a nd u e of 
med icati n . 

Schucki t prefers to uti li ze a method 
based on exi tence of seriou life 
pro bl ems related to alcohol. " If a 
person has 'eparated or divorced or 
has had mul t iple arrests because of 
alcohol or has experienced harmful 
phys ica l effects of alcohol abuse. he or 
s he would be labeled an alcoholic." he 
says_ 

"A definite dIagnosis depends on the 
exist ence of one major life problem

had many warnings that alcohol was

Scripps Hospital gets 1 million for Center 
Scripp Memorial Hospitals 

have received a $] million gift 
from the Harry G. Steele 
Foundation of Newport Beach 
which will be used to help 
finance a new ho pital for 
chemical dependency rehabili -
tation o n the cri pp s 
Memorial Hospital campus in 
La Jolla . 

The hospita l rece ntl y 
announced its plans to build a 
free-standing center near its 
Copley and Winzer medical 
and urgi ca l tower. and 
adjacent to its new Whi ttier 
Inst itute for diabete., to be 
dedicat ed this spri ng. Two 
buildings wi ll be constructed 
for th center, one of 74 beds 
for adults and the second of 24 
beds for adolescents, \\ ith 
some common areas for 

dining, recreatio n an d 
exercise, and meetings. The 
co n str uction costs are 
estimated at $4 million with an 
additi"onal million plu ' for 
equipment and furni shing. 

Ames S. Early, president of 
,Scripps Memorial Hospitals, 
said , "We are grateful to the 
Steele Foundation for t his gift. 
With hea rt and ca nce r, 
alcoholi sm is one of the 
n atio n' three lead ing 
cr i pp ling disea ses. A 
co nservativ national esti· 
mate puts ] 0 percent of the 
population among the rank:-. of 
alcoholics. A recent sun'ey 
indicates that 11 percent of the 
nation's teenagers us some 
form of chemical - diet pi ll s, 
s tr ee t drugs, al-oho !. 

Chemical dependency di seases 
are robbing the United States 
of much of its human potential 
and productivity. The reality 
is grim ." 

"The physicians and staff of 
Scripps Memorial Hospita l 
made a commitment to attack 
the primary cause of so much 
suffering when 16 bed ' in the 
La Jolla hospital were devoted 
to c he mical dependen cy 
recovery in 1979. The beds 
wer immediately ful l. Within 
t\\'o months of the opening, the 
Center expanded to 23 beds 
and filled upagain," Mr. Early 
explained. "We expanded to :~:l 
beels in December, 1980, and 
there il-l a continual wait. With 
these additional beds, there is 
so much more we ca n and 
must do. 

The effects of alcohol: a synopsis 
By JOE FALLETTA 

Senior taU Write r 
T he law defin es a per 'on as 

intoxicated or drunk at a blood 
alcohol level of . \0 percent , or 
medicall y s tated , 100 mg. 
percent. That level i u ually 
achieved when he or she 
con urnes five beer, four 
glasses of wine or four mixed 
drinks in an hour. 

along \\'tt h incoordinat ion and 
poor rea tion time. 

Concentrations of 200 
through 299 mg. percent bring 
on nausea an d vom iting and 
levels above 300 mg. percent 
cause inabilit y to function and 
loss of bodil y sensation; 
anest hesia . Coma, re 'piraLOry 
failure and death come with 
blood alcohol levels of b tween 
-100 and 700 mg. percent. 

a lcohol is not that unusual. Dr. 
Marc. A. Schuckit of the 
Veterans Administration 
:\1edica l Center notes, "Many 
people die every day in the 
Uni ted States from lethal 
overdoses (i.e. taking in 
enough alcohol to stop their 
respirations)." 

Ot her effects of a lcohol 
appear before that magic 
number, however. 

According to Drs. Charles 
B cker, Robert Roe and Robert 
Scott, aut hors of Alcolrol is a 
Drul{, a blood alcoholb el of 20 
mg. percent to 99 mg. percent 
induces musl le incoordination 
and changes in m ood, 
personalJ t y and beha vior. 
"!\1arked mental impairment" 
come'i at le\els of .10 10 .1<)9. 

The authors note the lethal 
dose of alcohol fo r ad u Its is 
bet we n fl\'e and eight gm. per 
kilogram of body weight. 
where one gm. equals one 
milliliter of 100 percent et hyl 
alcohol. And. if the drug is 
taken without solid f(xxl, death 
may occur before that point. 

D 'ath from an m'C' rrloqe of 

Schucki t, writi ng in an 
article entit led Alcohol and 
t4lcoho/islII, add ' a major 
problem is created when a 
person drink s and take" 
medication. Alcohol potenti· 
ate" the effects of sleeping pills 
and tranq uili z rs like Librium 
and Vali um, augmenting the 
effects of the IIldi\'idual agents

Andrew Keeler, Arts Editor The, Arts' Page 1,2 February 16, 1982 
Prof. Larsen pens 
suspense-thriller 
Book published by Random House 

BY TIM AUGUST 
laU Wriler 

Nol A Through Street , a 
recently released novel by 
vi iting lecturer Ernest 
Lar en, is a thriller in the be t 
sen e of the word, containing 
all the elements a book needs 
to keep your attention riveted 
from the fir t to the last page. 

The author liken hi work 
to the cia ic thriller by 
Raymond Chandler. whom he 
respects a great deal, and has 
attempted to emulate the style 
and genre populatized by the 
best thriller/ mystery writers. 

However, there is much 
beyond the thriller a pect of 
this book. Nol A Through 
Street has many political 
overtone which were actually 
the main focu of the work. 
Right off the bat, we find that 
the centrill character of the 
story. Emma Hobart, is a 
cabdriver ... who drive the 
night hift - not your typical 
Phillip Marlowe character. 

Having a woman as the 
leading character I . needles~ 
to ay,quiteachangefrom the 
usual. Larsen explain, " It 
scared a few people ... they 
couldn't believe that a woman 
would be t hat kind of per on." 
His bigge t problem with the 
book came about trying to sell 
agents and editor. on the idea 
of having a woman in thi type 
of role, which is e pecially 

trange because most of the 
people he dealt with in 
publishing the bouk were 
women . 

Probably the bigge t 
problem with the main 
character, Emma, is that she is 
not your tereotypical helpless 
female. Sh(' is "decidedly 
working class" and as Larsen 
says. "she has a lot of political 
co nsciousness." Not to 
mention that she is just as 
tough as any male character:; 
in the book. 

A'ot A Through Street posed 
a challenge for Larsen in his 

attempt. to combine political 
i ues within a tory of this 
type. " I wondered how 
explicitly political I cou ld 
make it and get people to read 
it. That's why I cho e that 
g~nre - the suspen e thriller. 
I tried to get it 0 people of our 
generation could pick up on a 
lot of the oolitical references in 
the book right away and 
other audiencc.s would 
pick up on the story and 
slowly realize the 
political dimen ions of 

.it. " 
Beyond the feminist 

role of the leading 
character there i a 
much more important 
political i ueexamined 
in this book. "It's 
basically a political 
analy i of power and 
hi. tory, e pecially Viet 
Nam. The tory take' 
place in '74 - the 
Watergate era - and 
moves back through 
time to '67. '68. and '69. 
trying to how how the 
Viet am war is till 
alive 10 the corporations 
of America." 

It has recei\'ed many 
excellent re\' iews 
nation·wide, including a place 
on the New York Times Book 
Rel'iew "Notable Books of the 
Year" list. "It (sale.) have 
done very well. consideringit's 
got ten no ad \. e r tis i n g , 
absolutely zilch. I had a fairly 
easy time with the book. r 
found it hard r to get an agent 
than a publisher." 

De ' pile its apparent 
success, Larsen had reserva· 
tions about publishing the 
book. "Before 1 wrote this book . 
I never considered gett ing 
anything published by a 
straight publisher. I had a lot 
ofcruples against it. If you 
give a ixlOk like thIS to a 
straight publisher it becomes

bestsellers. " 
Though t he hardcover 

edition has sold out in most 
'bookstores it is not being re-
ordered. So the chances of this 
book reaching paperback are 
unfortunately pretty s lim, at 
lea t according to Lar en . 

The author himself is just 
as, if not more, fascinating 
than hi' work. Lar en is the 
prototypical writer. He never 
take on any more than part 
time jobs so as not to interfere 
with his writing. "I live.more 
or Ie s on a ubsistence le\'el 
because it' . the only way I've 
found to get enough writing 
done. " 

Though an M.F.A. from 
Columbia University. Larsen 
has supported himself and hi 
writing as a cabbie in ew 
York City, a janitor in San 
Francisco. and was once the 
Berkeley Santa Claus . (" I've 
had a milliun of those kind of 

jobs"). As a cabdriver he wa 
able to develop his ideas for the 
'main character in hi s book, 
who play a cabdriver. and in 
the cour e of hi dri ving career 
has had some frightening 
experiences, such a being 
s hot at in Harlem. 

In spite of the danger of 
being a cabbie in New York. 
Larsen saw it as a good source 
of employment for a writer . 
"As a cabdriver r could drive 
two night a week and write 
the re t of the time." 

In addition to his writi ng 
and other work, Larsen is 
commercial film editor for 
Jump Cut, a noted internation-
al film magazine (you can find 
it at Groundwork Books and in 
various bookstores around 
town) that features polit ica lly-
oriented reviews of both 
commercial and independant 
film s. Be ides film reviews. 
jump Cut will soo n be 
featuring politically relevant 
photographic work which is 
being coordinated· by CSD 
Visual Arts Professor Fred 
Lonidier. 

Among all his other projects. 
Larsen is also the local 
coordinator for the currently 
forming National Writer's 
Union. The goals of the Union 
are many. but e~sentially it is 
directed toward developing an 
alternative publi hing outlet 
for writers other than the 
giant publishers in New York. 
"I think it's important to 
continue to develop an 
alternative press and 
publisher. The National 
Writer's Union could 
eventually militate against 
those publ ishing conglomer-
ates in New York." 

After Larsen finishes his 
teaching assignment here this 
quarter, he plans to resume 
work on his next book. a true-
life novel about the first 
terrorist, or at least the first 
person to use dynamite a. a 
political weapon. eedle s to 
say. if it is anything close to 
Nol A ThrollKh Street it will be 
excellent reading , reading 
that's not only enjoyable but is 
politicall y and socially 
relevant as well - something 
we could certainly use more of 
these days.

. Allen tosse~:4-hitter} whiffs 8 as teammates score 17 runs in three games 

BY BILL F ISH 
In t heir fir t series of the 

season, the Triton baseball 
players proved that they are 
for r ea l. Opposing the 
Claremont College Stags, a 
team which won the CM 
Division III Regional s only one 
year ago, UC D fought for a 
total of 27 innings in a double-
header on aturday and an 
extra-inning thriller on 

unday. 
It wa the Tritons, however, 

who finishf.' with the better 
opening record by winning the 
dou ble·header. Several players 
were quick to point out to their 
rookie coach. Lyle Yates , that 
this was the first double-
header won by UC D in five 
"ears. 
- In the first game, the tory 
was tall left-hander, Bob Allen. 
After early control problems 
(he launched 31 pitches in the 
first inning). Allen displayed a 
\' a riet y of mot ion sand 
changed speeds effecti\'ely to 
go the distance and pick up his 
first \A' in of the ·eason. 6-2. 

··!t·s heen a long time. " the 
sout hpa\\ repeated cont lOU ' 
ousl)'. Indeed. Allen posted an 

o-~ record just onl season a~CI. 

Commenting on his win. 
Allen says. "once r found my 
curve in the third inning. I 
could do just about anything." 
As evidence. he logged eight 
slrikeouts and allo\vcd onlv 
four hits in this seven inning 
affair . Ten hits, including 
three by Dana Ostrom. and no 
errors by the Triton defense, 
gave Allen all the support he 
needed . 

The second game feat ured a 
come-from-behind rally in the 
seventh. A clutch bases-loaded 
single with one out by Jay 
Sierzchula gave UCSD the 
tying and winning runs. 
Catcher Mitch Rieder followed 
with an RBI single. but that 
was more t han Triton 
relie\'ers Keith Giarmann and 
Keit h Yokomoto needed to 
secure a 6-4 \'ictorv. 

It was the lasi game on 
unday. though. which 

pro\'lded the most excitement 
for the few fans attending.

showed as Irvine easi ly swept 
their four matches. 

Division I teams are mor 
dedicated, tenni~ is their life 
and school is secondary. Most 
of the Irvine players have 
scholarships. They are thus 

committ ed to the game 
because If they clon't play \\ ell 
they can lose their scholar-
-;hij). 

On a bnghter note, Peter 
Wood and EugeneJones playt'(\ 
consist ently well throughout 
the weekend. Number one-
seeded Jones rolled to a couple 
of convincing Victories in 
matches against Davis and 

an ta Crul'. 

The Tritons won only one of 
their four matches, but it was 
their most important. They 
thrashed Div. III rival anta 
Cruz, 8-1 . 

There was a greater than 
normal mten -i ty of play this 
weekend. with more screams, 
grunts and groans than an 
orgy. The tremendous caliber 
of play made the tournament a 
treat to watch. Each 
indi vidual mat eh contained 
aggres ' ive net play, powerful 
serving, SW ift groundstrokes, 
uncanny accuracy and very 
few mistakes. Most· of the 
points were decided by 
unreturnable put -away shots.

In the second half both squads dueled for the lead. The 

advantage traded hands seven times in 17 minutes and the score 
was tied twice before PLC managed to -pread things out. With 
four minutes left. the Crusaders put m a 3-2 offen e de, igned to

The Tritons were hampered 
by the loss of Everett Gee who 
badly 'pram d an ank le in his 
second match. After the 
tournament , coach Peter 
Davis remarked, ''I'm a little 
disappointed because I don't 
think we played up to our 

championship trophy. "A l-
though I was not present," h 
contends, " I understand that 
the statement was made that 
'Worn n 's Volleyba ll was th 
first team from UCSD to ever 
win a national intercollegiate 
championsh·p.' This 'i t ate-
ment is about five months

compete with larger schools, 
Vallerga adds that because of 
them. each Individual's 
commitment to the sport has 
increased and a unifying force 
has been exerted on the team. 
This unit y and com mitment.

A MONTH. 

AND OPEN THE DOOR

ENGINEERING FUTURE. 

How many corporations would be willing to pay 
you over $800 a month during your junior and 
senior years just so you'd join the company after 
graduation? Under a special Navy program 
we're doing just that. It's called the Nuclear 
Propulsion Officer Candidate-College Program. 
And under it, you'll not only get great pay during 
your junior and senior years, but after 
graduation you'll receive a year of valuable grad-
uate-level training that is not available from 
any other employer. 

If you are a junior or senior majoring in 
math, engineering or physical sciences, find out 
more today. And let your career payoff while 
still in college.

agement Programs Office at:
