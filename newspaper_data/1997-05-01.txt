grand openi ng.of the new headquarters of Gen-
Prohe Inc., a hranch of Chugai PharnuIl:eutical. 

The funds generated from the endowment 
will support the Cancer Center 's campaign for 
preventive and clinical cancer research . 

Dynes said the Chugai cndowment is a 'ig-
nificant step in the worldwide effort against 
cancer. 

"This is the largest gift ever made to endow 
a chair at CSO, and is parti 'u larly timely as 
we ob 'erve the 25th anniversar of the war on 
'ancer," D nes 'aid. "By providing this gener-
ous level of support for groundhreaking work 
in cancer research. Chugai has hecome a part -
ner wilh 0 in Ihe inlernational effort to 
develop improved treatlllenl~ and even cure~, 
With progress ultimately helping cancer

Scient ists have

Iype of molecule is 
termed "diral" 
after the Greek . 
meaning " handed." 

T he different 
mirror images often 
have radi(;ally di f -

app lied in pra(;lIcal 
applications like

The first chiral

Pasteur found that a 
compound he creat -

both right- and left-

the time. he had to 
identify the differ-

result can be disastrous. 

As a result or these mi~hap , 
scientists - and especiall y drug 
t;ompanies - have been working 
hard to synthesize and separate the

The team of U • D-Ied scien-

the hydrogen are re latively small , 
and the chlori ne and the bromi ne 
are relatively si milar. so it's very 
difficult to differentiate the two 
chiral forms." Briggs said. 

Bui lding off an unsuccessful 
experiment from 1985, the U SD-
led research team used a " molecu-

The UCSD Department of Music will hold a memo-

rial service for Robert Erickson (1917-1997), com-
poser. author, educator. and co-founder of the Music 
Department, on Sat.. May 3 at Erickson Hall in the 
Mandeville Cenler. 

Enckson was instrumental in the deve lopment of 
the Modernist movement pioneered by Austrian com-
poser Arnold Schoenberg. 

For years, he experimented with a " twelve-tone ' 
system , spec/ally-made percussion instruments, 
extensions of vocal and instrumental techniques. 
along with naturally-occurring sounds. 

Erickson was also one of the first to wor!< exten-
sively with tape-recordings within musical compositions. 

The Mtnneapohs, San Francisco. Oakland and Los 
Angeles Philharmonic Orchestras had commissioned 
and performed Erickson's material during his life-
time .

three t"coeral appea ls judges over-
lUrned a previous j udge's injunc-
tion and ruled that Proposition 209 

wa~ con~titutiona ll y sound. 
Thc American Civi l Libcrties 

Union has filed an appeal c lai m-
ing that the pancl wa~ no t sup-
posed to rule on the (;onstit ution-
ality of the proposition, but 
mere ly decide whe ther to revicw 
it. 

Monday 's protest was timcd 
to coi n(;idc wit h the proposition 
taking cffect. The protesters 
made several demands. including 

one simply (;annot do research in 
emergency mcdicine situalions 
without propcr legal (;onscnl. Thl.: 
prohlcm with thi s is that there is a 
limited timc window when the 
experlmcntal therapy is optimal. 
but if the person is severe ly injured 
and unconsl:iou · it is hard to sati s-
fy the laws of consent." 

Shapiro gave several way~ to 
get around thc problem o f obtai n-
ing the consent of an unconscious 
person. including deferred consent 
and inferred consent. 

··Deferred consent is when the 
dOl:tor a,ks the person when he/she 
comes out of the unconscious state 
if It was ok that the ex perimental 
therapy was administered - Ihis is 
not a matter of consent at all . but a 
rorm of rati fication for .acti ons 
alrcady taken," he said. 

" Inferred consent is in regard 10 
when a person is unconsc ious and 
normal treatment is administered 
without prior consent. yet it i~ ok 
because this is what a reasonable 
person would prefer," he added. 

However, Shapiro said It is not 
p ssible to infer consent for cxper-

"Informed consent 
means that you do 
not do th~ngs to or 
for competent 
persons without 
their accord."

YaIidaIism is Wrong Despite 
Leglthl"e CoriceIl1S 

U SD fe ll victim to vanda lism last Friday when 
unknow n parties took it upon themselves to paint the 
concrete spheres next to Center Hall. The vandal s were 
apparently expressing their discontent at the demand of 
the Stuart Foundation admini strator~ to remove the 
sphe res before the stan of Fall Quarter 1997. 

Vandali sm is a c rime and should not be tole rated . The 
CSD police department estimated that it cos t around 

$2,(){)() to expunge entirely thl: l:vidl:ncl: of the vandal s ' 
deed. Admittedly, thi s is small c hange compared to the 
multi-mi ll ion-dollar annual hudget of U SO, but it 's still 
money that could have gone toward something use ful. 

Whil e we disagree with the vandalism, we can under-
stand the vandals' concerns. The concrete spheres are 
being removed at the command of Stuart Foundation 
admi nistrators because they think that people might mis-
take the spheres for a nother S tu art e xhibit. 

It 's easy to see why they' re worried . M a ny of the 
items in the Stuart collecti on are hard to see as arl. 
You know that too-hi g h blue mesh fence in the euca-
lyptus grove east of the Sun God or the rip-off of 
Stonehenge south of Galbraith Ha ll ? The Stuart peo-

, pie ca ll those art. 
With these marginal works of art litteri ng thi s campus, 

it's easy to see why Stuart administrators fear that people 
might mistake tasteful landscape architecture (i .e. the 
conc rete spheres) for bad art. 

Removing the conc rete spheres sets a dangerous 
precedent. If the Stuart Collec tive can hold sway over 
landscape-architecture decisions, whaL about oLher deci -
sions? W ill their wishes determine what future campus 
buildings will look like? 

We deplore vandalism of any kind. but we also 
deplore the heavy-handedness of SLuart Collectio n 
administra tors who presume Lhat they have the right to 
decide what the res t of the campus sho uld look Ii ke. 

Volunteering Should Be a 
Choice, Not a Requirement 

Forced volunteerism - yes . we realize it 's an oxy-
moron - may soon become a reality. Al the recent threl:-
day summit on volunteerism in Washington, D .C. , sever-
al formcr presidents joined o lin Powell in callin g on 
Americans to geL involvl.:d in the ir communities . SUlllmit 
organizers expressed hope that America's problems can 
be alleviated by encouragi ng community involvement 
and so lutions . 

While the ideas promulgated at the summit e njoy 
widespread support, certai n groups fear that the tradi tion-
al concept of volun teerism will be replaced with gradua-
tion requirements and other mandaLes . These groups use 
as an exampl e prop sa ls by several school districts and 
universi li es to I' rce hi gh scho I and college s tudents to 
log a fe~ hours of comm unilY service each year in order 
to graduate , despite the com plete lack of relevance of 
such service to an academic degree. 

Such a change would be disastrous . People shou ld vo l-
unteer and get inyolved in their communities - but the 
decision to do so should remain a personal choice. 
Forcing studen ts to partieip<!1l: in the communi ty is in 
direct opposi tion to traditional American concepts of frec-
dom a nd sacri lice. Furthermore. deciding what shou ld be 
acct:pted as ommunity service would be probll:l11atic. 
For insLam; , wuuld !> 'rvice in a c hurc h group o r d p liti -
cal rganizatiol1 satisfy community-service requirement s? 

We want volunteers to bl: out there becausl: they 
choose to , not because they arc prisoners of an educa-
tional sys tem gone mad .

COMMENTARY: "Mainstream" feminism often marginalizes women of color by failing to expand issues of race 
beyond merely those of black and white, making it difficult for others to identify and relate with the movement 

FEMINISTS ARE NOT ONE AND THE SAME 

G rae e JANG 
Againsl 

TIll.' Grain 

Hey. I've got ncws 
for you: Females are 
not one and thc same. I 
do not wholeheartedl y 
ad vocatc the caw,e of 
every other women. 
nor do I condone the 
action, of all women. 
..; imply h.:cau .. c I am a 
woman.

<.:;11 <.: di smantling il. The majoril Y or women 
simply say, "I totally ~upport equal rights ror 
women and everything. but )' m not a femi -
ni,t." 

Most importanl. however, arc the inter-
secting aspects that comprise each woman 's 
identity - race, ethnicity. sexuality. religion 
and class - and determine her expcrienl:e or 
patriarchy. 

I once embral:ed the notion or universal 
sisterhood: We women have to sti l:k togeth-
er because men - those sl:heming. phallil: 
manirestations of patriarchy's evils - are 
the enemy. I was angry, hated anything tOt-
ing a third leg and stuck only to women . 
This, 1 believed, was how a true. hard-I:o re 
feminist sh uld behave. 

As I learned more about my presl:ribed 
status as a woman of color, I gradually real-
ized that the bonds of "sisterhood" I:arried a 
price - and women of color had to pay it. 
The pursuit of a ulllversal ideal applicable to 

all womcn meant wash-

that we arc helpless or victimi/cd in our ,uh-

We arc struggling against injustices 
incurred upon us as hoth wumen <rnd people 
of color. We cannot do so under the assumed 
blanket of mainstream femini sm. As in any 
m vement strivi ng for change, ce rtain 
groups arc marginaliL.ed. This is not because 
white people arc inherent ly evi I. but because 
other group ' may lack assertive cohesion 
and/or the dominant group docs not try hard 
enough to include them. 

Feminism. as it is currently practiced. is 
not a panacea for all womcn; women or

Un til Western feminism (a lso I:a lled "main-

their own. because no one else will.

Bingo.

In,tanl rappon. 

In the subsequent "newspaper

inside information - detail s about 
corporate structure, name~ of 
founding partners. office polili cs, 
recent deals, whom to impre", who

After thanking him profuse ly. I 
left with a caveat - "Look. I'm a

piece will run . If it does, I'll send 
you a copy. In any event, I' ll call 
you whether my editor decide, to 
run my article or not. Thanks again 
for your help." 

Resourceful reconnoiters cover 
all bases. . 

I spent two day~ composing a

ac tuall y 111 charge of recruitment , 
ci ting the company\ ,ucce,~ful 
deal-making record. naming name, 
and congratulating it on it, recent

They mu~t have been impressed.

I miled crypticall y. 
Three days later, I began my 

career in the world of hi gh finance. 
olhing I read in the Wall Slreel 

j nurnal could have prepared me for 
what foll uwed. 

Pledge Week in the Money 
Fraternity 

The novelty 01 working at a 
presliglous inveslment hank wore 
off quickl y. I-bankers work long 
hour, to j ustify thei r obsce ne 
salaries. and Ihe new 'assoc iates arc 
pledge, m thiS fraternity of wealth . 
"Face time" was important. 

Everybody was anxious to show off 
how much time they pend in the 
office. 

This had its absurd momenls. 
A 'sociates would arri ve early (at, 

~ay. 5:30 a.m.), and deliberately 
leave notes on partners' desk, like: 
"Came in to discuss bond repur, 
chase issue from Company X. Sorry 
to miss you. Talk later. Dav id. 4:02 
a.m.", "Need credit rating updates 
on Utilities sector by noon. Please 
fax me data when you get a chance 
- Michael. 3:5 a.m." 

This was not what I expected. I 
entered this world to learn about 
business and linance, not play 
"busier than thou" games. It looked 
as though the new pledges must 
sing and dance before they were 
accepted as equals. 

It has been said that many presti-
giou, fi rms hire Ihe same kind of 
smart people over and over again . 
It's true: I could ~ec il in my intern

ge nt and unimaginati ve young men. 
Thcy place more blind faith in 
account ing ledgers, com pUler 
spreadsheets and elaborate mathe-

and inlerviews with the employees

The Price of Hubris 
I never understood the pri ce of 

blind faith in preadsheets until I 
was working on what was 10 be my 
last deal. The linn was brokering a 
buyout of a small software company 
in Silicon Valley. Part of the 1-
bank's function was to determine 
Ihe fa ir price of the larget company 
by pcrlo rming what is ca lled "due 
di ligence," where, in theory, the 
bankers diligently analyze Ihe busi-
ness and delermine it s fair market 
value. 

Reality : the analysts and young 
MBAs were sent to crunch numbers 
while the partners played golf with 
the CEO and executive staff. 

Practical curiosity forced me to 
make a few visit s on my own to the 
company we were supposed to eval-
uate. Informati on inev itabl y 
becomes ohfuscated as it travels up 
and d wn communication channels. 

I now understood wh y I' ve 
always mi strusted economists' near-
reli gious faith in numbers to quanti-

. , 
f y human transactions. 

In an informati on economy, the 
mosl valuable company assets dri ve 
themselves home every night. If 
they are not treated well , they do nOI 
return the nex i morning. The most 
valuable assets can never be quanti-
fied in an accounting ledger or 
boxed in so me warehouse . 
Somebody should have told Ihat to 
the lOve ·tment hankers. 

In Ihe case of this comrany. the 
majority of the truly innovalive cod-
ing that the lirm [lroduced was real-
ly the work of two junior program-
mers. Li ke many creati ve peoplc, 
Ihey also worked on pn vare rrojects 
(i n Ihis case. advances and deri va-
ti ves of the companies own soft-
ware products). 

Both of them repeatedly asked 
for modest funding to defray their 
costs, and were continuously 
slonewalled by management. I was-
n't surpri sed, the senior executi ves 
were all accountants - those 
trained to ,ee employees as expcns-
e~ to be minimi zed . rather than 
lOve ·tments to be nurtured. 

To the ~urpr i e of everyone e lse. 
three weeks aher the takeover was 
consummated, two "minor" 
employees cashed th ei r opt ions and 
quit the lirm , leav ing behind a half-
comp leted source code that wou Id 
take months for new programmers 
to li gure out, and a dozen pointing 
lingers and mUlual accusations of 
bad judgment. My analysis report 
on employee dissatisfaction wilh 
unresponsi ve management and its 
consequences on Ihe lirm 's ultimate 
value was left unread. 

A lillie management foresight 
and thoughtfulness could ha ve 
saved the firm - but the "leaders" 
were convinced they could run a 
husiness through a balance sheet. 

Already disillusioned. I prepared 
my resignation leller. The linn was

Thursday, May I. 1997 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 7 

Focus ON GREEK SLATE IGNORES IND VIDUALS 
Editor : 

ot onl y was I offended aft er 
reading the co mment ary by 
Grace Jang, "UCSD Should Keep 
an Eye o n Greek late," many of 
my fello w slate members were as 
well. I made the sill y as umption 
that sin ce elections were ovcr, so 
was the mud slingin g. Apparenl ly 
I was wrong. 

Last time I checked. I was a 
mixed-race woman at UCSD and a 
mcmber of a sorority. (Actually ii 's 
a fralern i t y, but because of modern 
misunderstandings we arc termed a 
sororily.) I am not now, nor ha ve I 
ever been a "sororit y chick." Why 
should it matter thai we arc in 
organizations that assisl the I:Om-
munity, continually get higher 
grades than non-Greek students 
and provide networking opportuni-
ties after college? How does Grace 
have the knowledge to say that we 
are only going to help the Greek 
system ? I thought the job of the 
Associated Students was to repre-
sent all students, but after these 
elections I can see why people may 

have the inclination to shy away 
from certain groups. since I have 
rea li zed more about dirty politi cs 
Ihan I ever wanted to know. 

For instance. I' ve never had a 
complete stranger rai e hi s voice 
to me and olhers whil e sayin g 
we 've leflthe minorities behind . 
It 's disturhin g 10 hear so many 
people who don' l know me. pre-
judge me, or judge how I act 
toward and with other minorities. 
In res ponse to the claim that we 
cannot all naturally be "down for 
the cause" o f minority right s. I 
never claimed to represent the 
entire minority population at 
UCSD, nor all of the women. My 
job will be to represent all stu-
dents at UCSD, minorities 
included , as well as all other 
groups who I.:omprise this col-
lege. 

Infuriating as the article was , I 
was especially surprised that 
Grace was able to make uch 
assumptions about what services 
I have used. I passed Chemistry

Women's Center has helped with 
various resources and l've gone 
to the Cross Cultural Center for 

meetings and classes . But it 
seems like no mailer what I do, or 
how my slale members respond 
10 differenl questions, people are 
onl y Interesled in the fact Ihat 
many of us arc mcmbers of 
IF IPanhellenic. Becall se we 
chose to enhance ollr lives in this 
way. those of us who are claSSI-
fi ed as minOrtli es. arc c lassi fi ed 
as sellouls. 

It seems tu me th ai eve ryone 
who is stereotyping us is just as 
guilty as so meone who crosses 
the street al night bel.:au se a 
Bl ack or Latino man is walking 
toward him. or someone who 
changes lanes while driving 
because an Asian is in the lane 
next to him. What makes this so 
vastly different ? Before this elec-
tion I would have argued thai 
these were totally different 
things. Unfortunately, afler these 
past weeks, having student after 
student question my status as a 
mixed-race woman. ra ther than 
what I wanted to do if elected 
into office. made me rea li7.e that 

many people are so inlerested in 
their own cause that they did no t 
care aboul what I would do if 
e lected into offi ce. Ralher, Ihey 
were concerned with how I will 
he lp. or hinder, Iheir cau se, 
specifica ll y the minorit y cause. if 
e lecled in . 

I am nOI speaking for my slate, 
hUI rather fo r myse l f, when I say 
that I am di sappointed that many 
of the sludents at CSD did not 
take the time to Ialk 10 me , and 
chose to li sten to whal someone 
e lse said , as happened in the 
SAACTHI organi zations . Now 
that we have been elected into 
office, take the time 10 know us 
for the individuals we arc. and the 
diverse backgrounds we repre-
sent. For the students who voted 
for the majority of the Revolution 
s late, thank you for the support . 
and please help us to conlinue to 
represent the student body 
throughout Ihe upcoming year.

the UC system 
cannot provide for 
the needs of Its 
disabled .tudents" 

- Coleen Sabatini 
A.S. PreSident 

surrounded the pC1lent in; proposal 
of a fee increa~e to covcr th ' 
growing expenses of CSD'~ 
Ofrice for • tudent s wi th 
Disahilit ies (aS D). 

Brian Murray, assistant vice 
chancellor for studcnt devclop-
ment . represented a D at the mcet-
ing. Murray exp lained that the 
office's current funding b inadc-
quate even to maintain its prescnt 

level of service~. 
Murry said the most pressing IS 

the lack of fUlldi ng for a Teachcr 
Educat ion Program offering ~et 10 
hegin thi s July. This program 
would bring deaf students to CSf) 
and provide interpreters for all of 
thei r classes. However. thc lack of 
funding for the intcrpreters has 
placed the program in Jeopardy.

To kill or not to kill , that Is the question: Lavinia (Kiersten Van Horne, left) IS consoled by 
Titus (Scott Rob inson). "Titus Andronicus " opens tonight at the Mandell Weiss Forum Studio. 

ROMAN TRAGEDY 
"Titus Andronicus" premieres tonight 

By Ilona Fass 
Co-Associate Hiatus Editor 

"The Most Lamcnlable Tragcdy or Titus 
Andronicus," presented by the UCSD Theater 
Department in the Mandell Weiss Forum Stu-
dio tonight through May 10, provcs yet again 
that Shakespeare knew what he was doing , 

One need not bc an Engli h major to 
appreciatc the compelling themes of violence, 
honor and power that saturate the plol. A web 
of inlrigue is spun around two groups or pco-
pie, the Romans and the Goths, Tamora, the 
queen or the Goths (p layed by Jennifcr Mor-
ri s) is on a merci less quest for revenge arter 
the general of the Roman army, Titus (p layed 
by Scott Robi nson), sacrifi ces her son. 

A cloak or terror envelops the kingdom as 
crimes of pa5.'oion and a thirst for bloOO ~Tellle a 
world in which limbs arc severed and violence rulcs. 

In the words of Set and Costume Designer 
Christopher Acebo, the play i ' "incredibly 
passionate and sexual - it is interracial, 
which is how Shakespeare wrote it." 

Some or the most cha llenging aspects of 
producing "Titus Andronieus" are the techni -
cal difliculties associated with conveying 
murder, rape and mutilalion. 

" It 's pretty grand and horrific in scale, and 
having to do it in a space where everything is 
hcard , and every th ing i seen, is hard," Acebo 
said. "If the script calls for a fly being on a 
stump, the fly has to be there. There is an 
incredible amount of gore, and to do thi from 
a distance is easier Ihan from five feel away," 

II is this vc ry intimacy, created by such a 
close view of the stage and the a ·tors, that 
williurc audiences into Shakespearc's world. 
A si mple se t composed or a huge SlOne wall 
and silver trec stumps is enough to make 
Imperial Rome <!ome to lire. The ethereal and 
mysterious music that accompanies the per-
formance enhances the overa ll cffect and 
intensifies the macabre ambiance. 

The cast allows Shakespeare 's use of lan-
guage to shine by avoiding cumbcrsome Eng-
lish accen ts and rocusing on the eloquence 
and grace or the words themselves, In addi-
tion 10 Robinson and Morri s. Jacques Smith 
portrays Aaron, Tamora's lover, and Kierslen 
Van H me plays Lavinia. 

While the raint at hean may have reserva-
tions about attending, a healthy dose of humor 
balances out the blood and guts, The cast of 
''Ti tus Andronicus" has been rehearsing since 
the beginni ng of March. Under the direction of 
Val Day, the cast members ' professionalism and 
style will leave no doubts as to why UCSD's 
Department of Theater was voted among the 
country's top three theater programs. 

''Ti tus Andronicus" opens tonight at 8 
p.m., with subsequent performance tomor-
row at 2 p,m., Saturday at 8 p,m, and Sunday 
at 7 p,m. Performances continue on Wed., 
May 7 at 8 p.m. and a matinee performance 
on Sat., May 10 al2 p,m. Tickets may be pur-
chased al the Mandell Weiss Thealre Box

Colorado's Big Head Todd and the Monsters have 

a traveling habit and a knack for old-fashioned rock n' roll 
Y1 

ith four albums, over 1,200 concen tour 
dates and th ree appearances on the 
HORDE summer tour under thei r belts, 

olorado's Big Head Todd and the 
onsters (BHTM) bring a whole new meaning 

10 a "hand on the run." TIle band 's loyal follow-
ing and not-quite-mainstream 
approach 10 Illusic ha. kept it a rock n' 
roll powerhouse to reckon with . 

BHTM 's newcst release, Beollr; -

unlquc hlcnd of blues, soul, plZ and 
rock, as well as its hard work elhic

re~1 01 the world . 
Tomorrow nlghl at the Be lly Up Tavern In 

olana Beach, BHTM wi ll continue to show-
case its dynamite live act , backed by Ni l Lml 
as the opening act. 

Todd Park Mohr (guitars/lead voca ls), 
Rob Squires (bass) and Brian Nevi n (drums) 
all met while goi ng to school in suburban 
Denver. Although Mohr attended Colorado 
State Uni versit y, while Squires and Nevin 
went to CU Boulder, the trio maintai ned 
thei r bond 'as a band , roc king mostl y 
th rough fratern ity houses and·parti es. Their 
moniker bei ng a tribute to Denver-area local 
blues hero, Eddie "Clean Head" Vinson, Big 
Head Todd and the Monsters began to 
spread thei r sound throughout the country, 
driving from state-Io-state in a 1979 Pl y-
mout h van they affectionately ca lled "The 

Colone l. " 
"We're just really proud of the years we 

spent traveling around in a van," says Squires. 
"We were able to make it through those years, 
which I thi nk we' re rea lly proud of." 

Through the strength of its live shows, 
Big Head Todd and the Monsters 
garner a respec tab le following 
th roughou t the U.S. Self-produced 
releases in 1989 and 1991 caught the 
att ention of Revo lution Records 
(then call ed Gi ani ), and the nand 
went on 10 n:lease' it s fir~1 major-
lahel albul11 , Sisrer Sweerly, In 1<)93. 

_ Their laid-nack style and tounng 
'. '" habits .oon caught Ihe attl:ntlon of 

Blues Traveler frontmlln John Pop-
per, who en lisled the trio for Ihl: rirst two 
HOR DE tours in 1993 and '94 . 

Big Head Todd and the Monsters wi ll also 
perform on th is summer's HORDE tour 's 
West Coast dates, swi nging thr ugh Southern 

·California in JUly. Although many associate 
the band as similar to its' HORDE compatri -
ots - "jam bands" such as The Dave 
Mallhews Band, Blues Traveler and The 
Black Crowes - Squires doesn't necessarily 
think that· it's fair to absolutely equate 
BHTM with these acts. 

"We kind of get lumped into that catego-
ry," he says. "We feel we have some of the 
same roots - blues and so on - that some 
of those other bands do. When we play li ve, 
we don' t stretch out our songs as much as 
[they do]. [HORDE] is more than just a jam 

band fes ti va l. There's a great amount of vari -
ety, and for some reason it just got labeled as 
a jam band tour." 

Big Head Todd and the Mon ters conti nue 
to steCr clear of lhe spotl ight that has calapult-
ed olher similar bands to overexposed stardom. 
While Mohr 's strong-yet-suhtle bluesy vocals 
and mean guilar, Squires' Oowing nass and 
Nevin 's rock-groove drums pack enough lire-
power to se ll record~, the band doesn 't release 
many singles or produce many videos. 

"It '~ not Inh:ntional, we've ju~t kind of 
done it on our own," says Squires. "We never 
really waited around for ol11ebody 10 help u~ 
to flut n:cords OUI. I think we've gotlen a rep-
utalion a~ nol wa nllng any help." 

l1eautiful World'!> "Resignati on Super-
man," howl:ver, i~ receiving limited airplay 
and video-slot time and ranks with the band 's 
best material. The alnum ilself ranges from 
BHTM's more sophi s ti ~a t ed sound in the 
first few tracks into a simpler blues-style in 
the last few, includi ng a guest appearance by 
blues great John Lee Hooker on a remake of 
his classic, "Boom Boom." 

"It 's a great- ound ing record and it comes 
down to the songs and the materia l," says 
Squires. " It 's our best so far." 

Bi g Head Todd and the Monsters will 
c ntinue to produce great-sound ing tunes 
that dabble in Soulhern blues, soul , jazz and 
rock roots. You can bet that they ' ll keep on 
rocking live crowds as well , even though 
they probably use more than just a van these 
days.

Continued from page 10 
ing process. Noodle came in about 
1985 and Ron about 1987. We did a 
couple of 7"8 and put the first 
record out in 1989 on Nemesis

taph, did Ignirion in \992, Smash in 
1994 and now we're here. 
There's a lot of positivity in 
your music. Has that always 
been an atti.tude of the 
band? 

Yeah, Dex ter write all the

just different thing~ thai he mighl 
he feeling that day. 
Did you have any idea that 
Smash was going to be such 
a hit? 

No. not at all . We wenl in and 
recorded it the same way we did all 
the other albums. We were kind of 
ru hed, since Epilaph wanted 10 gel 
it out , and we did il in about three 
week '. We thoughl it was a good 
album, and we hoped it would do 
well and mayne get us alOund the 
NOFX-Bad Religion area, but we 
nad no idea it would do what it did . 
Did you feel any pressure 
from the success of Smash 
when you were making the 
new album? 

I think it would be unreali s ti ~ to 
think that we could do as well, or 
beat SI/Iash because that was kind 
of a unique thing. We knew Ihat 
there was obviously going to be 
some attention because after you 
have success, people expect you to 
nop and are looking for that. We 
tried not to worry about writing a 
hit song or anything for the radio 
because when you try to do that, 
that 's when you do nop. Once we 
got in the studio, that was the last 
thing on our minds. We were just 
tryi ng to get the ong right so we 
didn ' t have to do it another 20 
times. 
On Ixnay, you experiment 
with many different styles. 
Do you think i" _ "" evolu-

I th ink so. We've always 
sc rewed around wilh difrerent 
things. I think we were more reluc-

Our old producer wasn' t rea lly 
into doing it anymore and we had 
done three albums with him, so we 
felt it was time to move on. We 
contacted Dave Jerden, who had 
worked with Jane's Addiction and

brought out of album . All of his

I t appears that noth ing can stand between U2 and world domination. The Iri sh quanet that took the world by Slorm in the '80s refu e 10 let its 
popularity die and cont inues to reinvent 
itself as a band to be reckoned with . 
Monday night at Jack Murphy Stadiu m, 
the four lads from Belfas t proved that 
they arc worthy to follow in the foo tsteps 
of bands like Th.: Eagles and The Roll ing 
Stones. 

2's PorMar! Tour is being labeled as 
one uf the highest-grossing lours ever, 
raking in $1.7 million per perform_anee, 
charging an averag' ti cket price of 60 
and opcrati ng one of the 111 0St high-tech 
stage SCI-UpS e cr.

concert -goer in un ull -oul a lt a' ~ on the 

~cnscs . 
Launching directly II1to "Mofo," a 

tcc hno-house track from the hand ' late,t 
re lea,c, Pol', it necame clear that U2 was-
n' t about to mcss around. The intensity 
level ne ver weakened. 

Thl: band 's _I-song set had sOlllet hing 
for everyone, young und nnt -qu ite-as-
young .. U2 offered up "1 Will Follow," a 
track from the hand 's 1980 debut. Boy, 
several songs from Pop , and countless 
others in between - including a sing-
a long karaoke version of The Monkees' 
" Daydream Believer." 

As if the power-packed, yet heart -
stopping s ngs weren ' t enough to keep 
the di sappointingly small audience capt i-
vated, the stage set and audio-visual light 
show proved mesmeri li ng . 

The eye-catcher of the PopMan set 
was a loo-foot-high golden arch that 
resembled something from a certain Ifast 
food chain . Accompanied by a ISO-foot 
by 50-foot giant screen made up of I mil -
lion individual pixels, a 35-fool-high 
di sco mirrorball lemon and a 12. foot -
wide martini oli ve on a IOO-foot-tall 
toothpick, U2 took full advantage of its 
huge ,superstar status by throwing its Her-
culean proportions in the audience 's face. 

The themes of the concert were sur-
prisingly po litically-dri ven. During "Last 
Night on Earth ," another new track, the 
screen showed a surreai' animated film 
whi ch satiri zed modem society'S addic-
tion to consumerism and desensiti zation 
to violence. 

In the meant ime, U2 blazed through a 
set of some of its best material. Included 
were tunes fro m 199 1's Achrung Baby, 
such as "Even Better Than Lhe Real 
Thing" and " Until the End of the World ,"

really do anything to change them 
or anYlhing like thaI. 
Do you think that the new 
sound on the album has 
something to do with the 
move to Columbia Records? 

No, prelly much all Ihe songs 
were wri tten before we signed with 
Columbia. That look place about Ihe 
beginning of last year. We had 
already demo .. cd everything anyway. 
We loki them when we signed with 
lhem Ihat we didn't want anyone in 
the studio and they didn't actually 
hear anYlhing until it wa.~ done. 
So the Hme album would 
have come out on Epitaph? 

Yes. I ~an't see why it would 
have changed.

What was the bottom line 
on what happened between 
Epitaph and the band? 

Basica lly, we Ju,1 couldn 't work 
anything out. Brell IGurcw itL, head 
of Epitaph Records l actually wanted 
to sign us for another album. We 
owed him one album and he wanted 
to sign us for another one, so he 
approached us about Ihal. We nego-
tiated that for a year, and just cou ld-
n't work anything Oul. Every time 
we thought we had something 
worked oul , he would somehow pull 
it or change it. There was some 
uncertainty with the company as far 
as whether he was going to sell it or 
sell part of it. Our relationship just 
rea lly deleriorated 10 the point where 
we felt it was tilllC for us to move on.

Is there a reason you fol-

They're very contrasting 
styles. 

We chose "All I Want" because 
it was really the only one we were 
able to choose as a si ngle. It 's more 
representative of our sound - peo-
ple don' t really get a chance to hear 
the faster ones. "Gone Away" was 
prelly much radio-chosen - they 
just jumped on that. They were

"Well, we don 't ha ve to make a sin-

"Pride," from 1984' The

classics from the band 's 1987 
smash, Tire l OS/ilia Tree ("I Still 
Haven't Found What I'm Look-
ing For," "Bullet the Blue Sky") 
were also served up. 

Lead singer Bono continued 
to be the egotistical-yet-friend ly 
rna ter-showman as he fed off 
the crowd's energy. lAs always, 
Bono included numerous oppor-
tunities for the crowd to sing 
along in his traditional call-and-

the crowd could hear him . 
Bono 's microphone was COIll-
pletely drowned in the audial 
assault .

Lending new meaning to its

its famous ballad, "With or Wilh-

After a rendition of "Hold Me,

HOLE IN THE BUCKET 
Spearhead to perform with Camp Lo 

By Jonah Freedman 
Hiatus Editor 

The San Francisco Bay Area' s 
Spearhead. a band that mixes hip-
hop. soul and reggae. is sel 10 per-
form al Ihe Belly Up Tavem in 
Solana Beach next Wed .• May 7. 
The band is touring in support of its 
newes t release, Chocolate 5upa 
Highway (Capitol), the follow-up 
to its 1994 debut. Home. 

Spearhead was founded by lead 
singer Michael Franli. a former 
Uni versity of San Francisco basket-
ball player. During his college 
years. Franti headed up a group 
ca lled the Beatnigs. a band with 
industrial leanings. 

Courtesy of Capitol Recoras/ChIlpman Baehler 
U Can Sing R Song: Spearhead is (from left to right) Ras I. Zulu, 
Michael Franti. Carl Young, Trinna Simmons. 

Following the breakup of the 
Bealnigs. Franti went on to join the 
Disposible Heroes of Hiphoprisy. 
Both bands took on political topics. 
including racism , homophobia and 
im migration. 

As the lead singer of Spearhead. 
Franl i chooses to focus more on 
musical quality and lyrics. The 
name of the band comes from an 
African Zulu weapon .used in hand-
to-hand combat. 

"It·s a name we take as the spir-
it of our militancy in the struggle 
and also how we reinvent the tool 
of our time to help us liberate." 
Franti says. 

Much of Chocolate 5upa High-
wa), was written on the road during 
Spearhead 's involvement with last 
summer's "hip-hop-palooza." the 
House of Blues Smokin ' Grooves 
Tour. which feat ured Cypress Hill. 
the Fugees. Ziggy Marley and 

Bu ta Rhymes. 
The album. which picks up 

where Home left off. continues 
with Spearhead 's signature groove 
highlighted by posi tive politica l 
messages. It also features collabo-
rations with Joan Osborne and 
Marie Daulne of Zap Mama. 

Spearhead 's current tour fea-
tures Camp Lo as a co-headliner 
and hip-hop brass band Coolbone 
as the opening act.

Ihe fruils of hi s labor during the

starter on the frontline for much of

reserve role and provided UCSD 
with offensive power off the bench . 

Brian Hunnieutl. a San Diego 
local from nearby Carlsbad. moved 
into a ~tarti ng role for the Tri tons at 
Iheend of the season. Kn own for his 
eXl;e ll ent passing skills. Hunnicutt 
could be relied on both offensively 
and defensively from his outside 
hiller posi tion. 

Chris Cru!., another San Diego 
produl;t. wa~ the emot ional spark-
plug for the Tritons. Used primarily 
in a rese rve role. Cruz could provide 
a much-needed energy boost to a

Crusaders are Sent Packing 
WARMUP: In their last game before playoffs, the Tritons defeated PL, 6-1 
By Nicole Varg.s 
Senior Staff Writer 

After battling its toughe~t op-
ponent of the year and spending a 
long weekend in Ojai forthe West-
ern Indi vidual Champi onships, it 
isea y to imagine the UCSD men ' s 
tenni s team '~ relief Tuesday when 
it trave led to Point Loma for it s 
last regular-season competition. 

The Tritons defeated the ru -
saders easi ly, 6-1 , dropping onl y 
one si ngles match and one douhles 
match . The team improved it s sea-
son record to 9-8 just a little more 
than a week berore the NCAA Di-
vision III Regionals in UC Santa 
Cruz, 

Top-seeded Steve Shabel man-

aged to co me back aft er a disap-
poi nting doubles loss with a mara-
thon three-set victory over Ray 
Starck, 4-6, 7-5 and 7-5. No. 2 
Emil Mihct nceded only two sets 
to ove rthrow Enrique 
Mere les, 6-3 and 7-5 . 

No. 4 Ken Liu sent Ryan 
Aday pac king after Aday fell 
in the final two sets, c los ing 
out the match with a ~core of 
6-7 , 6-3 and 6-4. Fifth-
seeded Anthony Meli charek 
and si xth-seeded Ari Marken 
also contributed to the Tritons' 
po. iii ve result s with victories over 
their respective opponents. 

Melicharek trounced Kyle 
Acree qUickly with a 6-0 and 6-2 

score, while Marken beat Derek 
Parkey, 7-5 and 6-2 . 

UCS D's fi ve si ngle victori es 
~ame after a successful doubles 
effort. Although Shabel and Ben 

Becker were unab le to de-
feat the top Poi nt Loma tan-
dem, the second- and third-
seed represcntati ves pull ed 
off wins in their respective 
matches . 

For the first time th is sea-
son, Mihet and Liu tea med 
up as the No. 2 duo and 

defeated Mere les and Aday , 6-1 
and 6-3 . In th e third-seed match, 
Me licharek and Dave Murphy 
came back after a tough 7-6 first 
se t to win the second set, 6- 1.

plating hath runners. The Tritons 
added yet another run in the fi rth 
when Mason led off the inning 
wi th a double, and Jon Goldsmith 
singled him home. 

The Tritons were then up 7-0, 
and starter David Takehara was 
cruisi ng. He had great movement on 
his fa tball , and his ofr-speed pitches 
were keeping the Cru. ader bats at 
bay. After he got out of ajam in the 
third, he was unstoppable, all owing 
two hits over the next four innings. 

"When I was warming up in the 
bullpen, my arm fclt rcally li ve," 
Takehara said. ''Then (Triton pitch-
ing coach) Pat House came up to 
me and told me to have athletic 
arrogance. He said, 'Go out there 
and act like you got it. '" 

Thur day, May I, 1997 

Takehara wasdoingjust that until 
the eighth, when he began to tire, He 
tried hi s best to finish the inning, but 
he didn ' t have enough gas and gave 
up three runs and loaded the bases. 
Fletcher then went to hi s bullpen, 
and brought in Yoshayah Goldfarb. 
The freshman side-armer came in 
and gO! an out, but not before gi ving 
up two more run . 

The Crusaders now had a big 
rally going. They had already cut the 
lead t08-5, and they still had runners 
on base. Fletcher was forced to go to 
his bullpen again , and this time he 
ca lled left-hander John Gherini . 
Gherini had been pitching very well 
of late, and he came in and finally 
closed out the inning. 

In the ninth , Fletcher went with 
Rondest vedt. The sophomore 
came in and lammed the door on 
the Crusaders, ending the game 
with a strike out that caught the 
last Crusader looking. 

Freshman Backs Up Her Big Words in the Pool 
NATIONALS: Dara Burch 's three goals against UC Davis proved to be enough to carry UCSD into the NCAA Championships 
By Jonah Nisenson 
Staff Writer 

A funny thing happened before

player was ca lling to guarantee her 
coach a win . 

The player wa~ Dara Burch. In 
holding up her guarantce, , he ~cored 
three 01 the four Triton goal_ in the 
victory over the Aggies. In a game 
that meant everything to h e r squad ' ~ 
hope ofa trip to the NCAA Champi -
onships in Ann Arbor, Mich. in two 
weeks, Burch shined when hertcam-
mates most needed it. 

"When we were leaving the ho-
tel , I found out I UC Davis I had lost 
11 - I to UCLA," Burch said. ·'We 
losl 8-3 to UCLA , which was a 
smaller amount than Davis had lost 
by, so I just thought we could win ." 

Although only a fres hman, 
BUf(:h' s c lutch play against the 
Aggics howed maturity. The win 
against Da vis was CSO's ~econd 
victory of the tournament , which 

qualified the team ror Nationals. 
"When Dara called. I was kind of 

like, 'Yeah great, whatever, sounds 
gO(1d' ." Harper said. "But I' ll he hCln-

Following the win over UOP,

Seniors leave the volleyball 
squad after spectacular year 

The 1997 UCSD men 's volleyba ll 
team's Magnificent Six have fought their 
final battle and now ride off into the sunset 
as one of the most highly decorated and 
successful gradu3tingclasses in Triton vol -
leyball history. 

Entering the season, the veterans on the 
UCSO squad were faced with a 
daunting task: adjusting to a new 
head coach while battling through 
a schedule loaded with perennial 
national powerhouses. From early 
on in the year, it became clear thai 
the six graduating seniors would be 
rdied upon to provide leader hip 
for a team with the potential to 
make an impact on the vo lleyball 
communit y. And what an impa 't they 
made. 

On February 12, the Tritons hosted the 
o. 10 ranked Trojans of USC in a Moun-

tain Paciric Sports Federation (MPSF) 
match . With seniors · rie MaL Matt 
Minehan and Satao Minami leading the 
way, UCSD forced the match to fi ve games 
before using its superior sideout skill s to 
stea l the win for first -year Head oach 
Dunca n McFarl and. 

But the Tritons had little time to cel-
eh rate their hlgge~l win in ~c h ()ol hi story 

b~causc three ni ght> l a t~r they ho,ted o. 
9 ranked Long Bea~h State and r~peated 
their spectacular feat hy knocking off thc 
4gers in fi ve game~ . 

Fo llowing the two most hi storic wins 
for the men's volleyhall rrogram. UCSD 
was ranked No. I in Di vision III and even 

received votes to be ranked in the top 25 for 
Division I. At the Division 111 National 
Championships, where the Tritons plaeed 
fourth, Mai was se lected to the ali-tourna-
ment team after previously being honored 
as the.only Triton ever to receive the MPSF 

player or the week award. 
The play of the 1997 seniors was 

recognized by Volleyball magazine, 
which saluted UC D for its upsel 
victories and for its No.1 ranking. 
With theirtwoconference wins thi s 
season, the Tritons equa led the to-
tal number of conference wi ns for 
UCSD pri o rt o thi~ year. At the final 
home game of the season, again ·t 
cross-town ri al an Diego State, 

the seniors were honored prior to the match 
and given a stand ing ovation by the Triton 
ralthful. 

Mai , an outside hitter who played only 
olle year at UCSD after transferring , was 
the offensive backbone for the Tritons. He 
led the team in kill s and attach and was 
ranked nationally in those same categories. 
Known ror a wicked jump serve and a 
dead ly cro,s-court swi ng, Mai provided 
the aggressive offen ~ive li repowerthat was 
nece,sary when facin g a Division I hlock. 

A two · ~port star who al so anchored Ihe 
ba,kctball team, Minehan was the top all -
around player for the Trilllns. A quiet leader 
lor the Triton" Minehan wa~ abo the core 
of the hlocklng unit and an accurate hitter 
who w uld always be counted on for a kill.

Coyotes Feast on UCSD 
SKID: Even after dropping 10 of thei r last 11 , the Tritons till 
have a chance to make the po tseason with a win on Saturday 
By Travis Hili 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

Imagine havi ng a huge midterm on Thurs-
day. I mean huge ; thi s midtenn will make-or-
hreak your grade, and you need an 'A' be-

cause Ihi s c la ~~ counts on your 
major GPA. Butlhe midterm IS 
at 3 p.m. and you also have a 
lillie qui/. at noon. The qui/. is 
not going to heea\y, bUI it won't II really hun too hadly i fyou screw I it up. All ThaI wa~ the si tuati on the 

.......... _-- sl umping UCSD 'oftbalileam 
faced going Into yt.:, terday ' , doubleheader 
wi th Cal State San Bern ardino. The Divi -
sion 1I Coyotes have had U SO' s number 
thi , year, defealing them in Iheir f'ir~1 two 
meeling. o f the sea,on. But while thi !. 
doub leheader wa, Important for UCS D 's 
overall record, it ~ only rea l va lue would be 
momentum for Saturday ' s huge w nt e5t 
agai nst rival Cal Lutheran . This hallie IS the 
huge midterm ; thl , game wil l mean every -
thing in Ihe way of pOMseason survival for 
the women. 

But hefore that. the Triton\ \ t i II had to face 
San Bernardino. It wa, tough for the Tritons 
to get motivated forthese game~, and il showed 
a\ they lost both wnte~ t s. 4-1 and 5·0. 

In the opener, the Tnt nns got a strong 
outing I rom senior Kri sten chueler, who 
only gave up nine hils in seven inning' pitched. 
Butthe oyote pitcher also had s u t:c~\" shut -
ting down Ihe Truons. Through the liN three 
innings, there was no score. But in the top of 
the fourth an error by T riton shorts lOp Missy 

Belmer gave the Coyotes two unearned run~ , 
and they ended up scori ng three run s to go up 
)·0. 

The Tritons go t one back in their half or 
the fourth on an RBI double hy ChrisllI1e 
Scaring. plating Cynthia Sam. But caring 
tri ed to stretch her doub le into a three -
hagger and wa~ cu t down . After that rally, 
the Triton~ were silenced for the fe,l of the 
eveni ng. 

The Coyoles added another insurance run 
in the fifth, and lh at wa~ all they needed. The 
Tritons hit well enough to score runs, and they 
put together ~ome potentiall y dangerous ral -

li e~ , but th ey ju~t couldn ' t ring the bell, leav-
ing 10 runners on. 

In the nightcap, Triton staner Erin Flanigan 
was roughed up ea rl y forthree runs in the first 
two innings, and the Coyotes got a one-hit 
shutoul from lheir ~tarte r as Ihey crui sed to a 
5-0 vic tory. 

Both l osse~ were indeed fru trating. but 
in no way demorali/ing. The Triton~ wil l 
need no addi ti onal moti vati on for thi s 
Saturday ' s mal c hup . Ca l Luth era n is 
UCSD's biggest rival and every stati sti c 
wi ll he thrown out for thi s game. It no 
longer muliers that the Tritons ha ve los t 10 
oft hcirla\tll contcsts; itisnowaonegame 
season . If the Tritons wi n, they go to the 

p l ayoff~ . If they I()~c, they don'\. 
"Our whole season cOl11es down to thi s," 

pitcher Mary Jane 0110 ·aid . " In each game 
we have lea rned su met hing that we can u e 
for Ithe Cal Lutheran game!. and you know 
what'! We' re going to beat them, I guaran-

For those who have been fo llow-
