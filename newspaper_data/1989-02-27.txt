The second in a series of three 
hearings by the California State 
Assembly Subcommittee on 
AIDS was held Friday in the Cen-
ter for Molecular Genetics at 
UCSD to determine the role of 
the Univer ity of California in 
treating AIDS patients. 

The debate centered on finan-
cial issues concerning whether to 
primarily fund care for AIDS 
patients or upport research for a 
cure. 

"The University of California 
task force on AIDS should 
recommend whether priority 
should be given to research or 
care of AIDS patients," Tom 
Hayden, chairman of the sub-
committee, said. 

According to Doctor Howard 
Robins, speaking for private hos-
pitals in the San Diego area, the 
state should concentrate on pro-
viding AIDS education for doc-
tors and should address the prob-
lem of un com pen ated health care 
provided to AIDS victims. 

"The state should mandate 
AIDS education for health pro-
fessionals, as has been mandated 
in nine [other] states," he said.

bian and Gay Men Community

Future Ph.D. Shortage Ad'dressed 
By SUSAN E. HYLEN 
Staff Writer 

In remarks to the Regent of the 
University of California, UCSD 
Chancellor Richard Atkinson 
called for the creation of a 
National Fellow hip Program for 
graduate student in order to ful-
fill the need for Ph.D. in natural 
cience and engineering in the 

next century. 
Speaking in San Francisco on 

Feb. 16, Atkinson warned of "an 
increasing demand for Ph.D.s that 
will not be met by the upply," in 
upcoming years. 

He warned that "if corrective 
measures are not taken immedi-
ately, by the ea rl years of the 
next centur , the annual supply 

f Ph .D.s available to the nation ' 
work for e will be about 10.500 
vers u a de mand for about 
18,000." 

U ' ing data colic ted from the 
National ' ience Foundation, the 
National eadem of Science ' 
and the ational cad'my of 

Engineers, Atkinson told the 
Regents that currently the coun-
try employs 12,500 new Ph.D. 
scientists and engineers per year. 
Approximately 6,000 of these are 
in industry and 5,000 in universi-
ties, he stated, with the remainder 
in government positions. 

Atkinson said that the non-
academic sector would demand 
9,500 Ph.D. per year in natural 
sciences and engineering b the 
year 2004. 

I ncrease in both academic 
retirements and student enroll-
ment will in rease demand for 
new Ph.D. in school to about 
8,500 per year in 2004, he added . 

As a result, he aid, in the early 
year in the ne t century the 
country will need about 18,000 
new Ph.D.s per ear to meet the 
d mands of indu try and univer-
sities . Howe cr, the nation's uni-
versities will only be produ ing 
about 12,000 per ear. 

Furthermore, Atkinson estima-
ted that .000 of the!>c Ph . D.!. 
would be awarded to foreign !> tu-
dent ', making it .. 'crtain that not 

all 12,000 will be available for 
employment in the United State ." 

This shortage "will have devas-
tating consequence for colleges, 
universitie , busine sand indu -
try," he aid. 

In higher education, Atkinson 
predict that the competition will 
be acute among the top univer i-
ties, and that " econd-tier institu-
tions probably will experience 
erious difficultie ' in attracting 

and holding faculty." 
Atkin on al 0 aid a "bidding 

war" that could occur between 
universities and indu try for Ph.D. 
employees would serve neither 
well and would have seriolls Con-
equences for the nation' econ-

omy and defen e. 
Atkin on recommended the 

implementation of a fellow hip 
program to provide in entive for 
college tudent con id ring 
graduate work . He aid 3,000 new 
fellowships of 25,000 ould be 
needed each ear to meet the need 
for Ph . D .. The ost of su h a 
program would be 300 million

Protesters Picket 
'Anti-Choice' Clinic 

By ARLENE SISON 
Contributing Writer 

Dozens of pro-choice activists, 
including eight students from 

CSD, took to the streets of Col-
lege Grove Friday afternoon to 
protest in front of a clinic that 
allegedly offers false, anti-choice 
information to women about 
abortions. 

The demonstration, sponsored 
by San Diego's chapter of the 
National Organization for Wom-
en (NOW), "was organized to 
send a message that the Center 
For Unplanned Pregnancy is a 
fake clinic," said Lori Turner, 
coordinator of the protest and co-
chairperson of the group's Repro-
ductive Rights Committee. 

According to Turner and other 
prote tor , the Center advertise 
to women who are afraid they 
may be pregnant and want coun-
seling. Turner said the Center's 
phone book ads are deceptive and 
are· designed to lure women into 
the clinic where they are hit with a 
barrage of anti-abortion propa-

ganda. 
"We're trying to make the pub-

lic aware of what clinics like this 
are really doing," she said, point-
ing to the clinic located at the side 
of the Reformed Presbyterian 
Church on College Avenue. "A 
legitimate clinic lists it services, 
but a fake one tries to get at your 
emotions. 

"[The Center's] ad is a picture 
of a woman's face with tears in 
her eye and it doesn't say what 
services are available other than 
free pregnancy testing and what 
they call 'abortion education, ' ,., 
Turner continued. 

Protestors claimed that the 
Center provides abortion educa-
tion through the use of "terror-
techniques" uch a leaving a 
woman alone in a room to watch 
film or videos of "dead fetuses 
and bloody tissue" and be handed 
graphic pictures of how abortions 
are performed. 

While the director of the Cen-
ter, Eileen Scipione, did not deny 
that part of the clinic's procedure

UCSB Students Fast to Protest 
Racism, Demand Ethnicity Requirement 

SA TA BARBARA - Approximately 40 people 
gathered last Tuesday in front of UCS B' Cheadle 
Hall to announc~ the beginning of a hunger strike to 
last until the Untversity undertakes numerous mea-
sures to eliminate what they view a in titutional 
racism and increase ethnic diversity on campus. 

WhIle mne students pledged to participate in the 
hunger strike until the administration meets their 
demands, about 30 additional students intended to 
fast for two or three days to support the cau e. 

The strike was decided upon because "We, as con-
cerned student s, faculty and staff feel that we have 
exhausted all administrative remedies and have been 
forced to take more extreme action," reads a state-
ment of intent prepared by the hunger strikers . "We 
feel that thi hunger strike will compel the community 
to pressure the various decision-making bodies on 
campus ... to take u eriously and grant us our 
demands." 

The protester have several demands: the adoption 
of a two-course ethnicity requirement, the abolish-

me~t o~ the exi t ing two-course American history and 
mstltutlOns requirement, the creation of a task force 
to study the possible development of a gender studies 
requirement with a timeline for implementation and 
the development of an Asian-American studies 
department and a Native American studics program. 

Other demands include the hiring ofa minimum of 
ix minority faculty for each ethnic group at UCS B 

(African Americans, Native Americans, Asian Ameri-
cans and Chicano-Latinos), the hiring of a minority 
for the vacant vice-chancellor for student se rvices 
position and the appointment of at least two under-
graduate students to comprise 25 percent of a chancel-
lor's advisory or Academic Senate committee. 

The fasti ng and hunger-strik ing student also want 
proof of university divestment from companies with 
financial ties to South Africa in accordance with the 
19 6 Regent agreement to begin divestment. 

In addition to the group 's demands, indi vid ual stu-
dent organizations for Asian-Americans, Chicano l la-
tinos and African-Americans each called for more 
university responsiveness and greater sensitivity to 
their particular needs, as outlined on separate list .

Seven U C Students Arrested During 
Protest at El Salvador Consulate 

BERK ELEY - Chanting "Free the students, stop 
the war, U .. out of EI Sa lvador" as they were led 
away in handcuffs , seven UC Berkeley student dem-
on trators were arrested for trespassing at the El Sal-
vador General Co nsulate in San Francisco Feb. 19. 

The demonstration was in response to the rec(~'t 
arrest and detainment of two universi ty students and 
five trade unionists and the killing of economics stu-
dent Mario Flore Cuba in El Salvador, according to 
UC Berkeley senior Leanne Miller, one of the protes-
ters arrested . 

Student activist groups in Lo Angeles, Washing-
ton, D.C. and ew York were planning to hold sim-
ilar demonstration yesterday to show their solidarity 
with student revolutionary groups in EI Salvador, 
according to Miller. 

The Universi ty of El Salvador has charged the al-
vadoran go ernment with the murder of the econom-
ics student, whose body was found Feb. 4 tortured 
and mutilated , accordi ng to Julie Sinai, spokesperson 
for National Call to Action: Stop the U.S. War in EI 
Salvador. Members of groups affiliated with the 
organization protested outside the consulate in sup-
port of the students. 

Miller was arrested in El Salvador last month by 
Treasury police and detained for one day, allegedly 
for crossing into a guerrilla zone without the approp-
riate passes. 

Six of the UC Berkeley student - Miller, Mary 
Cornelius, Melissa Gum, Michelle Hasle and Tom 
Parks - were taken to the Hall of Justice in San 
Fra ncisco, cited for trespassing and malicious 
mischief, and released . They are scheduled to appear 
in court on March 13. 

All the students are members of Students Again t 
Intervention in Central America.

UCLA Questions Motives of UCSA in 
Lobbying for Students' Needs 

LOS ANGELES - UCLA's undergraduate 
government is protesting what members see as the UC 
Student Association's failure to adequately represent 
student intere ts by postponing a $5,000 membership 
payment to the organization . 

Stressing that the move does not signify a withdra-
wal of affilia tion with the system-wide state lobbying 
group, Bruce Cowan , UCLA's undergraduate UCSA 
representative, said the withholding of the payment is 
Intended to prod UCSA away from involving itself in 
issue that do not directly affect students. Council 
will re-evalua te UCSA's actions in the spring, and , if 
it sees a favorable cha nge in the organizati on's 
actions, the money will be given to UCSA with an 
additional $5,000 Council is scheduled to pay at that 
time. 

It is uncertain what will happen if the student 
government doe not perceive an improvement in 
UCSA's conduct, according to UC lobbyist James 
Callahan, a UCLA junior. 

wit's not like anyone's out to get UCSA," Callahan 
said. " It's just a protest ... We're still going to partici-
pate in the monthly meetings and the upcoming legis-
lative conference."

Searching for a Bomb - Russ Moore (left) and Rick Empson

Continued from page I 
responses by those threatened tend 
to decline as the threats are made 
with increasing frequency, and 
become routine, said Steven 
Shuchter of the UCSD psychiatry 
department. 

He continued to explain that as 
the attention decrea es, so should 
the frequency of the threats. 

It is not surprising, aid John 
Wickstead, a UCSD psychology 
professor, that the public often 
seems to take threats lightly. 

"Consider how many threats 
the public is exposed to," he said, 
"by personal experience or 
through the media." 

Simply making the threat, 
Shuchter said, could serve two 
purposes for the caller. 

According to him, a caller could 
gain a sense of control from the 
threat, which shuts down build-
ings and causes anxiety in others. 
Such a person , he added, might 
not feel he or she had much con-
trol over his everyday life. 

Or, Shuchter said, the threat 
could avenge a gripe the caller 
had against the institution. 

"]t's an easy way to anonym-
ously carry out a vende tta," he 
said. 

Shuchter also commented that 
the caller could be "anyone from 
a practically normal person with 

a gripe to a severely disturbed 
person who stops short of being 
able to act out his violence." 

" It generally takes something 
more than a gripe," conjectured 
Wlckstead . " I've had gripes with 
professors before, without threat-
ening them," he said. 

Wickstead considers the ano-
nymous callers to be antisocial 
personalities and said such people 
are categorized by an absence of 
remorse for their actions and a 
lack of morals. 

The typical citizen, he con-
tinued, would not act on his desire 
for revenge. 

"We're principled. We'd feel 
guilty. We've been socialized" he 
said. ' 

The threats are less overtly 
aggressIve than most crimes 
committed by antisocial criminals 
Wickstead said. Those crimes: 
according to him, include physi-
cal assault or actually planting a 
bomb. 

To carry out the threat, Shuch-
ter said, would take a more driven 
sicker, and more tormented 
person. 

Wickstead compared the copy 
cat bomb threats to the copy cat 
computer viruses spreading 
through the nation. "They're 
forms of anonymous malice," he 
said .

King Center Cop-Out 
The failure of the San Diego Unified Port District commis-

sioners to name the new convention center after martyred civil 
rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is unfortunate. More 
unfortunate is the continued polarization 0 er this issue. In the 
wake of the electoral defeat of the renaming of Market Street in 
honor of King, this i sue promises to tarnish the reputation of 
San Diego for a long time, perhaps even after some structure is 
eventually named after King. 

The buck on this issue is likely to be passed for several more 
weeks. Even after the City Council and Port Commission reach 
agreement, a referendum will likely place the issue on the ballot . 
This will give San Diego another chance to hame itself, or 
maybe, hopefully, a chance to put this issue behind us and allow 
us to turn to more su bstantive civil rights issues. 

It's hard to see why a name such as "San Diego M. L. King J r. 
Convention Center" would be offensive - as many have 
pointed out , everyone will just call it "the Convention Center" 
anyway. San Diego's reputation and economic well-being could 
be damaged ; just ask Arizonans, whose shame at Governor 
Even Mecham's revoking of the King holiday was one of the 
factors leading to his ouster. 

The commissione r's reluctance was ridiculous. King may not 
have been a perfect man, but few men are - and great men's 
flaws seem worse since they are cast in re lief against their vi rtues. 
But King has come to symbolize the victories he fought so hard 
to win, and the civil rights battles still being waged. Naming the 
conventi on center after him would not honor San Diego blacks, 
it would honor all San Diegans. Civil rights are human rights. 

Chilling Censorship 
The giving of offense cannOT be a basis for censorship. or 

freedom of expression would perish instantly.

Police in Bombay, India, opened fire on thou ands of rioting 
Muslims, killing at least ten peo ple and wounding 40. This 
follows violent riots around the world , from Pakistan to Eng-
land. All of this was caused by a book. 

This seems amazing, but it is an important truth that a book, 
an idea , can be more dangerous than hundreds of AK-47's . This 
is precisely why protection of free expression comes first in the 
Bill of R ights. Free speech will always be under attack, and its 
defenders can never become lax. 

But the stir over Satanic Verses. Salman Rushd ie's novel, is 
unique. Fear of terrorism led several major bookstore chains to 
remove the novel from their shelves, though fear of being per-
ceived as censors led them to reverse themselves - and at least 
one chain spent a considerable amount of money taking out 
full-page ads portraying itself as a defender of the First 
Amendment. 

M ore chilling is that opponents of the book - most visibly 
the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini - have called not only forthe 
banning of the book, bUl the execution of its author. This led to 
the fre uent quoting of George Bernard Shaw's phrase "assassi-
nation is the extreme form of censorship." R ushdie remains in 
hiding. 

It is immaterial whether the book is offensive, or even blas-
phemous, pornographic and racist, as its critics claim, The 
suppression of ideas does not make them wither; they must be 
brought out into the sun ofthe marketplace of ideas, and if they 
are strong, they will grow, and if they are wrong, they will die. 
The only justification for censorship is the fear that the ideas are 
true and may win acceptance, and this is no justification at all. ]n 
the case of Satanic Verses, it is ludicrous to suggest that one 
novel would undermine a world faith which has survived for 
centuries. 

We cannot hope to sway everyone to the idea that free speech 
must be protected - even those who claim to be staunch 
defenders offree expression often become hypocrites when they 
are offended. But what we can do, a s individuals, is to attempt to 
tolerate and defend free expression wherever it is attacked, As a 
nat ion, we can follow the advice of Franklin D . Roosevelt : "If in 
other lands the press and books and literature of all kinds are 
censored. we must redouble our efforts here to keep them free ."

UCSDRacism 
Frightening 
Editor: 

In regards to the "Q & A" ques-
tion "Do you think UCSD ha a 
problem with racism?" 
(G uardian , Feb . 16) and Ali 
Sadighian's "Editor in a Box" 
(Guardian, Feb. 2 1), I would like 
to contribute my response . 

At the Kaibigang Philipino 
dance held Jan . 27 at the Revelle 
Cafe (ironically to celebrate Asian 
Awareness Week), I was standing 
outside when I overheard a tu-
dent telling his friends (both non-
Asian males) that he left the dance 
because "everyone was Asian and 
had eyes like th is," pulling the 
corners of his eyes back. Being 
Asian, I was ve ry shocked and 
offended . 

I respect the right of anyone to 
leave a social event where one 
feels uncomfortable or "out of 
place ." Yet , it is frightening and 
depressing to find that an adult 
college student would express his 
insecurity with the kind of de-
rogatory behavior I have not seen 
si nce elementary school. Further-
more, this individual announced 
his racist feelings in the pre ence 
of Asian students as if we were all 
deaf or had no ·feelings . As for 

myself, I was so angry I could not 
get my mind off the incident and 
felt nervous for Ihe rest of the 
evening. 

Racism is a problem at UCSD 
just as it i everywhere else in the 
world, whether or not we choo e 
to admit it or act on it in a violent 
or overt manner.

Apathy Can 
Be Costly 
Editor: 

I would like 10 address the 
current issue of the administra-
tion's supposed infringement on 
student rights , I say "supposed " 
because these infringements could 
have never happened if the stu-
dents were tanding up for their 
own rights. 

As you well know, the adopti on 
of nighttime parking passed 
through a committee with stu-
dents on it only as a token gesture 
because the real policy had al-
ready been mandated. It must be 
noted, however, that a college 
(not A.S.) appointed rep actually 
voted in favor of this proposal. 
This method of 'student input' is 
used to avoid the common com-
plaint that no students opinions 
were sought . While I see this as a 
gross violation of student rights , I 
feel the students themselves are 
partially to blame. 

Recentl y we read of the 

Guardian s problem with Q & A: 
only seven students were wi lling 
to go on camera. The problem 
with student apathy is rampant 
and widespread. In a letter by 
Darin Malloy, Jim Edwards and 
John Wainio , they call for the 
students to take action . They then 
follow by saying that the "A.S. 
government is uniquely suited to 
lead the struggle to assert our 
rights. " 

The A.S . has tried to lead this 
struggle, but there are few fol-
lowers. I have per onally searched 
for those exact students who sit 
on the" tudent input"committees 
and have held positions vacant 
for weeks because no o ne is 
interested! I have seen student 
rights resolutions passed and 
stalled because the required tu-
dent representatives could not be 
found . I find and appoint only 
about 60 people from over 13,000 
eligible undergraduate students. 

While the students of UCSD 
chose to spend three issues of the 
Guardian arguing among them-
selves about who was qualified to 
analyze the parking problem, the 
admi nistration made the decision 
for u . The bottom line is this: 
students are now forced to pay for 
their apathy. No longer is this a 
figure of speech, now it is a 
financial reality. Effective next 
year, we will pay for parking 
during the day, at night, and on 
weekends.

Seeking Truth? 
By DAVID WYNER 
Associate News Editor 

I was silting in my room listening to music the 
other day when I put in a tape of Peter, Paul and 
Mary and a song they sang really caught my 
attention. 

" Blowing in the Wind ," in which they suggest 
that the answers to all the tough questions in life 
are, indeed, " blowin' in the wind ," brought to my 
mind images of college students engaged in a four 
(or more realistically, fi ve) year quest for the 
answers to some of those types of questions . 

It occured to me that if the answers are, in fact, 
blowing in the wind . the n the wind must have 
blown past U SO lo ng before I arrived here. 

Don't get me wrong,I'm happy with my choice 
10 attend UCSD, and I'm happy with most of 
what I've een so far. But, it see ms that there's 

I guess my gripe can be summarized by so me-
t h ing I once read in t he California Review that 
said, "To stea l from one author is plagiarism. To 
steal from ma ny is research." 

T hat's so accurate. 
It seems that there's too much a ttention placed 

o n analyzing t he ideas a nd theories of other peo-
ple, a nd boi ling those down into one midterm 
and one fi na l in which you must show your mas-
tery of those theories. Undergrad uates seem to 
rarely get a n o pportunity to delve into their own 
ideas and theories. 

A while ago I spo ke to a friend of mine about 
this situation. Right now, he's in an Orthodox 
Jewish school in Israel. He said that the approach 
there is almos t exactly o pposite to that taken by 
the UC sys tem, 

Instead of focusing o n many people's theo ries 
and condensing them into one or two papers, 
they focus on 20 li nes of text and are expected to 
extract from that their own meanings and their 
own interpreta tions. 

I realize that the reasons fo r going to that type 
of school are very different than those for attend-
ing a UC campus. I also admit that there are 
many benefits from the typical American educa-
tional system.

placently back and congratu la te 
themselves for purcha ing the 
coveted'S' permit coveri ng them 
for nighttime parking, what about 
the ot her half? Those of you (like 
myself) who ride the bus, rid e 
bicycles, motorcycles, or walk to 
campu and only use cars for 
nighttime classes, meetings and 
visits will now be fo rced to pay for 
something which was once free. 

I call on the students to stop 
complaining and start acting. 
Darin Malloy is a tudent rep and 
has done just that. Why not refuse 
to call t he students' new bui lding 
the " Price Center," and call it t he 
.. ew Student Center"? Why not 
publicize the fact that the sur-
round ing commu nities wi ll now 
have st udents parking in their 
front lawns day and night? Why 
no t discuss the Univer ity's bla-
tant disregard for nighttime safety 
with your parents or influen tia l 
people you may encounter? Why 
no t a lert future stude nts of t his 
University's commitment to deny 
student the right to have their 
ideas acted upon? Why not report 
thefts and assaults at night 0 we 
know exactly how this proposal 
will affect us? Student input is 
worthless without student action. 

The greatness of this "insti-
tution" is seriously threatened if 
the true conditions of under-
graduate life are revealed to those 
considering UCSD. I wish I could 
advertise the perfection of student 
life at UCSD but instead I can 
only quote Chancellor Atkinson's 
statistics and encourage tho e I 
meet to apply elsewhere. Perhaps 
we are only here for the "UCSD" 
on our diploma, but I think not! 

I encourage students 10 actually 
smile and say hello to other 
students when walking to class . I 
encou rage const ructive unity 
a mong the students, not idle 
arguing amongst ourselves. Is it too 
much to ask fo r 30 minutes of 
time. a week to si t in a nd show 
your st udent suppo rt for t hose 
committees ma king such impor-
ta nt decisions as parking policies? 
Once again, I keep telling myself 
the answer is no. It is t ime fo r 
UCS D 's students to stop paying 
for our a pa thy a nd start actively 
making this our school.

MANICURIST AVAIlABLE 

Options Are 
Disappearing 
Editor: 

The Guardian has printed numer-
ou letters in the past few weeks 
discussing the parking situation 
on campus. Most of these letters 
have had more to say about the 
relative moral qualities of com-
muters and o n-campus resident 
than about the real problem, 
which is that there are too many 
people for whom dri ving to cam-
pus is a practical necessity. Ob-
vious partial solutions to this are 
improving public transportation 
to and from campus, making 
bicycle travel safer and more conven-
ient, and building affordable stu-
dent housing on and near campus. 

It is ironic then that Tuesday's 
Guardian had a front-page story 
on the hospital and high-tech 
research park to be built on Uni-
versity la nd just east of campus. If 
this la nd (near t he present Mesa 
apartments) were used for student 
housi ng, a t ho usand fewer stu-
dents wou ld have to drive to 
campus every day. The increased 
supply would lower rents in 
nearby University City, so per-
haps hundreds more students 
would find it economically feas-
ible to live within bicycle ra nge of 
campus. 

Instead, the UCSD Master 
Plan calls for building yet afourth 
hospital within a half mile of 
campus, and adding to the exist-
ing dozens of high-tech research 
companies in the Golden Triangle 
east of campus. Both of these pro-
jects will create traffic and park-

ing problems, rather than help-
ing to a lleviate the existing 
squeeze, 

Wh ile we're at it, wouldn't it 
make lot of sen e for the planned 
north-south trolley line to top. 
say, on Gilman Drive so people 
could commute to the heart of 
campus on it? Instead, due largely 
to pressure fro m the UCSD 
administration, the stop i more 
likely to be near 1-5, from where 
few people will be inclined to 
walk all the way to the main aca-
demic buildings. 

The argument s against the 
Gilman stop - vibration dis-
turbing sensitive instruments, and 
undesirable transients riding the 
trolley to campus - appear to be 
rather bogus. Any instrument 
sensitive enough to register a 
trolley's passage is probably al-
ready having trouble with the 
buses on Gilman and the heavy 
traffic on Torrey Pines Road , In 
any case, it's easierto move one or 
two experi ments once than to 
move twe nty thousand students, 
faculty and staff every day, and 
experience at the University of 
Miami shows that a large influx 
of tra nsients is unlikely. 

As we've already seen in their 
pet Price Center, our administrion 
is much more interested in money-
making commercial leases and 
glo sy images than with the actual 
operation of a school. And in this 
case they're not just wasting 
student money on things the 
students don't want, they're selling 
off our o ptions for dealing res-
ponsibly with parking in the 
future.

Censorship 
By Terrorism 
Editor: 

A recent editorial in the Los 
A ngele Times points out the basic 
conflict between the prohibition 
of dissent by authoritarian regimes 
and our Con titutional guaran-
tees of the freedom of expression . 
However. the connict has even 
deeper roots ; it is es entially cul-
tural. 

It is the d ifference between tho e 
whose beliefs (and subsequent be-
havior) stem fro m indoctrination 
by "higher authorities" and those 
whose beliefs evolve from a ra-
tional exploration of experience. 
It is the difference between the 
closed min d and the inquiring 
mind . We too. have segments of 
our po pulation who reject the 
value of rational inquiry in the 
formulation of their belief sys-

tems, but fortuna tely that rejec-
tion is 1101 the chief cult ural va lue 
of our country. 

Perhaps t here was a time when 
the pen was mightier than the 
sword, but that wa \\- hen the 
word wa merely the exten ion 

of a man's arm. In our time the 
pen is certainly not mightier than 
the bomb or the bullet, at lea t in 
the short run. Therein lies our 
dilemma: what to do when a 
closed sy tem of belief threaten 
an open system with tact ic that 
a re considered barbaric by the 
open sy tem. "Death to dissen-
t er !" "Off with their head !" 

We can defend ourselves against 
attempted as assinations, but we 
ca nnot initiate such attempts our-
elve . And cert!linly the individ-

ual author or book publisher can-
not mount a successful defense 
against the power of a fa natical 
nation. What is needed obviously 
is a firm policy by our country

Yet , I can't help but think that 
the process my friend's school 
uses is much more conducive to 
personal growth. 

After all , what are we here for : 
to better understand ourselves and 
our place in the world, or to 
simply regurgitate other's ideas 
about u and our place in their 
world? 

Well, after a lot of thought, I've 

decided that Ihe latter is the more 
accurate as essment of our si tua-
tion here. 

But, I'm not sure that th i is all 
bad. 

I admit that when I first reali7ed 
thi, I was a bit disillUSIOned 
about 01 stay here . I felt like just 
one more number being processed 
through a gian t bureaucratic 
machine, and to orne ex tent I 
guess I still feel that way. 

But, now I can also ee the 
benefits of spending four (or five) 
yea rs here learning about other 
people's ideas about how I fit into 
their world. 

While I like to think that I have 
the knowledge and experience to 
make accurate judgements and 
statements about the world 
around me, I am constantly re-
minded by my father, a UC pro-
fessor, that there is still a great 
deal for me to learn . 

His argument is that before [

ideas and attempt to reach mean-
ingful conclUSIOns to life's tough 
questions, I must fir t undersland 
other, more learned people's con-
clu ' ions to those dilemmas. 

My UC education, hc tells me, 
i providing mc with that material. 

What thi~ means to me is that 
the UC system isn't primarily 
co ncerned with allowing it under-
graduates to explore their own 
ideas. They. instead, want 10 ex-
pose us 10 great philosophies and 
well-known ideas in the hopes 
that that exposure will later help 
us to create our own theories. 

However, I think it's only natu-
ral for us to continue questioning 
the material we're studying. The 
minute we stop questioning and 
start passively receiving the mate-
rial is the minute that the educa-
tional system becomes truely func-
tionless. 

So, there's a balance that must 
be reached . 

On the one hand , we must 
understand that as undergradu-
ates we are not asked to create our 
own ideas, but are instead gaining 
valuable exposure to others' con-
cepts and theories. 

On Ihe other hand, though, we 
need to also understand that since 
the UC system i n't going to re-
quire a great deal of introspec-
tion, it is up to us to individually 
question what we are learning 
and to stay attuned to our own 
feelings about the ~ateri_al. 

In other words, what I've con-
cluded is that if the answers to 
life's questions are "blowin' in the 
wind ," then we have to consider 
our UC educations as instruc-
tions on how and where to build 
our sails. 

The rest is up to us ,

clients, she did defend the clinic's 
goal. 

"When a woman comes in for a 
pregnancy test, we don't advise 
her of what to do. We show her 
photographs of what's inside of 
her at that very moment," said 
Scipione. " We offer help in mak-
ing a life-affirming decision. 

"Our goal is to save [a woman] 
the agony that will come some 
day when she realizes that she 
took her child's life and paid 
someone else to do it at a clinic," 
Scipione continued . 

Scipione said that the NOW 
protestors were mislabeling the 
Center's stance on the abortion 
issue by calling it "anti-choice." 

"They call us anti-choice but 
we are not against choice at all," 
Scipione said. " We're for the 
baby's choice." 

Taking an innocent person's 
life should not be one of the choi-

ces, the Center's director added. 
A volunteer for the Center' 

expressed her belief that "the 
unborn child has a right not to 
d · " Ie. 

One picketer, a UCSD alum-
nus who requested anonymity, 
chanted and wore a sign t'lat 
read, "This is a fake clinic!" 

She described a technique 
"commonly used by clinics affil-
iated with religious groups" based 
on a personal experience she had 
at a wsimilar clinic" in Los Angeles. 

Pregnant women, the alumnus 
said , are sometimes victimized by 
clinics that "tell women that their 
[pregnancy] test results are nega-
tive when they are positive in 
order to get the women [to con-
tinue her pregnancy into her] 
second and third trimester of 
pregnancy when it's difficult or 
impossible to get an abortion." 

Ph.D: Program Proposed 
Continued from page 1 
per year. 

"This is a small investment for 
the United Slates, given the ser-
iousness of the problem," Atkin-
son said. 

He likened such a program to 
the period following the Soviet 
launching of Sputnik, when many 
young people were hired as the 
federal government supported an 
expansion of science and engi-
neering faculties. 

Outlining other steps that could 
be taken to increase supply, 
Atkinson said more college fresh-
persons could be convi nced to 

pursue majors in science and 
engineering. 

Furthermore, students who 
would receive their Ph.D.s in 2004 
are currently in j un ior high. 
Therefore, students through jun-
ior high and high school could be 
targeted in an attempt to increase 
science and engineering majors, 
the chancellor said. 

Although Atkinson did not 
specifically discuss Ph.D .s in 
behavioral and social ciences and 
in the humanities , he did say that 
"the situation in those fields is 
probably not too different" frem 
the one he described in the natu-
ral sciences. 

cipione, however, claimed that 
protestors were "getting us con-
fused with other pregnancy cen-
ters," while saying, "we run on 
somewhat of the same principles." 

Lisa Cauble, a UCSD senior 
and one of eight members present 
from the UCSD Women's 
Resource Center, joined the 
demonstration and waved vigor-
ously at honking motorists.

Michael R . Stringer, director 
of UCSD 's hospital and clinics, 
commented on several factors that 
have contributed to making 
UCSD the major provider of 
AI DS care in the an Diego area.

that according to Gerard Burrow, 
dean of the chool of Medicine, 
"A real danger at prese nt is that 
doctor will know everything 
a bout AI DS and nothing at all 
about strep throat." 

"The most reliable estimate of 
the cost of treating an AI D vic-
tim ," said Doctor Phillip Lee of 
UC San Fra ncisco. "is $70,000 
with an average life expectancy of 
13 months. Eighty percent of the 
charges occur for those people 
who die in the hospital , the major-
ity of the cost occuring in the last 
three months of life."

Cyclists Pedal A cross the u.s. 
For Charity With Bike-Aid 

By JULlE SONNTAG 
Slaff Writer 

How would yo u like to bike 
across the Uni ted States this sum-
mer? It sounds like an amazing 
feat, but 287 people, ranging in 
age from 15-65. have made the 
3600-mile trek in the last three 
years as part of Bike-Aid . 

Bike-Aid is the majorfundrais-
ing event for the Overseas Devel-
opment Network (ODN), a na-
tional student organization. Ac-
cording to Lea chuster, an ODl\' 
national coordinator in the tan-
fo rd office, the main purposes of 
Bike-Aid are to promote aware-
ness of world hunger and poverty 
and to raise funds to help alleviate 
these problems. Since Bike-Aid's 
inception, ODN has raised 
$390,000. They hope to raise 
$300,000 more through this sum-
mer's program, Schuster said. 

Mary Kroetch , another na-
tional coordinator of the ODN. 
emphasized that participant~ 
don't have to be competitive rac-
ers. In fact , they don't have to 
have ?ny cycling experience at all. 

"The whole purpose of the event 
is to get [people] on those bicycles 
who are interested in the issues 
a nd who really want to partici-

pate," she said . 
The cyclists begin their journey 

in mid-June, starting from one of 
four cities : Seattle, Portland, San 
Francisco or Los Angeles. They 
travel on four separate routes , 
converging in Washington D .C. 
on August 18. Each group is 
accompanied by two support ve-
hicles which carry the cycli t ' 
gear, suppl ies and publicity ma-
terial. 

The groups travel anywhere 

" Participants do 
not have to be com-
petItive racers. In 
fact, they don't have 
to have any cycling 
experience at all. " 

-Mary Kroetch 

from 35 to 100 miles per day and 
stay ove rnight with various 
groups. They participate in dif-
ferent community ervices across 
the country, such as working in 
food banks and painting houses. 
They have even just stopped to 
talk with Native Americans on 
their reservations. 

Kroetch pointed out that "t he 

entire focus is not just se rvice. 
That's only one component of the 
whole educational [experience]." 

Kroetch empha ized that an 
exchange of ideas between the 
cyclists and the communities they 
pass through is important in order 
to "link issues on a human level." 

The public hears a great deal 
about the hunger and poverty in 
Third World cou ntries, Kroetch 
said . 

"Because of the same systemic 
structures, the same things are 
going on here ; they just look dif-
ferent. So [Bike-Aid] tries to give 
cyclists an opportunity to talk 
about these issues with people 
who have first-hand knowledge 
of it," she said. 

The funds that the cyclists raise 
through pledges go to self-help 
projects in different communities 
around the world. ODN accom-
plishes this through student chap-
ters on college campuses. 

The UCS D chapter of Students 
Encouraging Ed ucation and De-
velo pment (S .E.E.D.), has a 
matching funds agreement with 
ODN whereby S.E.E.D . raises 
half of the money needed for a 
community project and 00 will 
provide the rest, up to $5,000, 

Anyone interested in Bike-Aid 
should send $5 for an information 

Grove Gallery Exhibit 
An artist 's reception was held Friday night in the Grove Gallery 
in honor of ret ired San Diego artist Marie Du Barry, whose work 
is currently on display. The exhibit, entitled "Scenes of San 

Rubes 

Diego Circa 1930," displays 
_iiiiiiiiiiii~ oi ls, charcoals and sketches 

of landscapes of San Diego 
County painted between the 
1920s-40s. Du Barry, now in 
her 90s, attended the recep-
tion, where a silent auction 
was held for selected pieces 
of her work. Members of the 
San Diego/ La Jolla commun-
ity. as well as UCSD students, 
attended the reception. This 
exhibit , which co ntinues 
through March 18, is Du Bar-
ry's first exhibit in approxi-
mately 40 years.

Sophomore tacie Sasaki, in 

her fi rst start of the 1989 cam-
paign, picked up the victory in the 
first game of a doubleheader to 
lead the Tritons to a 5- 1 victory 
over USD Saturday. The Toreros 
from USD returned to win the 
nightcap. 1-0. 

UCSD (2-2) tall ied three in the 
fir t inning of the opener and 
coasted the rest of the way to 
claim the victory over the hosting 
DiviSIon I Toreros. In the second 
game, however, Dianna Moreno 
fell victim to a lack of offensive 
support and several cheap hits to 
even up the Tritons' record . 

The Tritons face their first Div-

When all i aid and done, u u-
ally a lot more is said than done. 
Thi is not alway true, however, 
e pecially with the C 0 wom-
en' basketball team. Frida 
night' 74-60 victory 0 er outh-

dreamed about. 

La t night the Triton di co-

But this hardly matter when one

Malone' end of the year sum-

great sea on becau e it wa done 
with gut against a tough che-

dule. The beaut of thi team, 
though, i it un elfishne ." 

This attitude of pia ing a a 
team brought the Triton to new 
heights a a group, but al 0 cata-

of the Triton record Ii t . To-

records in win (19), winning per-

Luckily for the Triton, back-

ups and replacements were j u t a 
capable of playing, and the team 
was able to recover from the bad 
luck of injury and illne s. The 
double teams were a mix of pIa -
er who had never played together, 
but they won the matches 2-1. 
The ingles teams won four 
matche to the tag' two. 

Of note in Friday' match was 
Rhonda M eier's ucce ful return

The UCSD men' volleyball 
team finally got to playa team 
closer to its own level - and it 
showed as the Tritons swept to 
an ea y ictory over the U ni-
ver ity of Santa lara atur-
day at the Triton Pavilion. The 
15-9, 16- 14, 15-7 win gives 
U 0 a 3-9 record. 

The 18th ranked Tritons 
have played a chedule full of 
top 20 teams and their record 
ha uffered a a result. But on 
Saturday morning against the 
unranked and outmatched 

anta Clara Broncos, the Trit-
ons prospered . 

"This wa a really good team 
win again t a team we should 
be able to beat," UCSD Head 
Coach 0 car "Digger" Gray-
bill aid. The Triton offense, led 
by the pa sing of both Jeff Bab-
cock and Nick Rothman, shifted 
into gear in the early going as it 
jumped out to a quick lead en 
route to a 15-9 win in the fir t 
game. U SO had a little trou-
ble in game two, and had to 

battle back from a 14-11 deficit 
before winning 16-14. With a

T he UCSD men's ba eball team 
came out fired up and ready to 
take on the Lancers from Cali-
fornia Baptist on Thur dayafter-
noon after a demoralizing defeat 
by an Franci co tate j u t a few 
day earlier. The Triton made 
short work of the truggling 
Lancer , coring eight run before 
the bottom of the fourth and com-
ing away with their fifth win of 
the season, 9-1 . 

Pitcher Rick Rupkey earned 
the win and increased U 0' 
record to 5-3 . Head Coach Lyle 
Yale utilized mo t of his players 
and also used three different 
pitcher to ensure the victory. 

"Yate is very fair about letting 
everyone play and get experience 
when he feels the game is secure, 
as this one was," catcher Jim 
Martinez pointed out after the 
game. By the top of the ninth, the 
entire field con isted of replace-

up 2-0. 

In the fourth inning, UCSD 
wa able to bat all the way around 
the order. Four out of the nine 
player collected hit and RBI 
while increa ing the lead to 8-0. 
The Lancers were forced to make 
two pitching changes in the bot-
tom of the fourth alone, and their 
third overall.

Scoring remained dormant until 
the top of the sixth when the 
Lancers howed signs of life on a 
run- coring triple.
