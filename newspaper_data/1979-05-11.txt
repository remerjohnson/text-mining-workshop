Odd-Even Rei ieves Little 
By Kathy Huffer 

Associate News Editor 
Despite some reports that the three-day-old 

emergency ga plan ha shown signs of 
succe s, gas lations in the UCSD a rea, at 
least, hay felt little relief from the long lines of 
fuel-hungry motorists and the dwindling gas 
supplies. 

Stations in the Del Mar, University City and 
La Jolla area report that gas lines have not 
decreased since California's Governor Brown 
signed the measure allowing counties to 
restrict motorists to gas sales on odd or even 
days. 

"It hasn't made any effect at all," Jim 
Stephens, manager of a La Jolla Texaco 
station aid of the allotment plan which was 
put into effect last Tuesday at midnight. 
" We're still getting the long lines." 

The emergency gas plan, a repeat of 
restrictions imposed upon Californians during 
the 1974 Arab Oil Embargo, allows motorists 
with an odd last digit on their license plates and 
tho e with personalized-letter pla tes to 
purchase gas only on odd-numbered dates. 

Vehicles with an even-numbered last digit on 
their license plates or without permanent 
registration can buy gas only on even-
numbered date . The 31st of each month does 
not impose any gas restrictions on ga ales. 

Juan Macias, an employee at a Del Mar 
Cheveron station called the allotment plan " a 
pain in the neck" and said lines are still as long 
as before the county restrictions were 
implemented. 

" It 's kind of a menace for us," Macia 
remarked , explaining that enforcing the plan 
has caused the station additional problems. 

A Mobil station on Governor Blvd . and 
Regents Rd ., too, reported that lines "are ju t 
as long a ever" and that more than 500 gallons 
of ga were sold during re tricted hours 
Wedne day and Thursday . The station' has 
shortened it hour thi week in order to 
provide gasoline tomorrow, said manager 
Wally Ko inski. 

Too Early to Judge 
Although the immediate effects of the ga 

plan have not appeared successful in this area, 
m any gas tation officials ay that the 
re triction have not been imposed long 
enough to predict its ultimate effect. 

Ron Couch , owner of a niversi ty City Mobil 
gas tation , aid that " it' hard to tell ," but he 
believes the plan is working. Although 
cu tomer lines have not les ened since 
restrictions were impo ed, the demand for gas 
i not i~asing at the rate of earlier last week 
and indicate that the " panic-buying" trend 
may be on the decline. 

It's going to be a week before this thing goes 
moothly," remarked Margo Lei mback, from 

the county's Citizen Assistance department. 
" It can't work overnight," she sa id. 

One'problem in assessing the allotment plan 
is that city and county officials ar e not 
gathering statistics from stations to monitor 
the effects of the restrictions . Instead, officials 
are relying upon individual gas station reports

Commentary 

Real Protest Not 
Often in Fashion 

By Ted Burke 
In May, 1970, I was winding up my senior year at La Jolla 

High School. Like most of the other kid I hung out with, I 
fancied myself as ari armchair radical, a long-hair kid who had 
all the hip patter and rhetoric of the New Left. At the drop of 
even the most casual reactionary comments I would get on my 
soapbox and recite the litany Qf horrors that the U.S. was 
committing in Viet Nam, backing up my decla ra tions with an 
endless stream of statistics that I knew as well as a baseball 
fanatic who'd memorized the batting averages of every player 
in the American League. To be anti-war was to be hip. 

The political atmosphere at UCSD was thicker and more 
determined. That May, 75 student protesters seized t~e fifth 
floor of Urey Hall and demanded that the university cease its 
war research. Teach-ins were held in the Revelle Cafeteria to 
discuss protest tactics against the sa me research. Chancellor 
McGill , at the request of Governor Reagan, announced th at the 
governor was closing the UC system as, some ~pecu~ated, a 
response to "increasingly violent student disruption of 
university business." 

Down at La Jolla High, the doper-longhair-radical faction of 
the student bodies envied the UCSD activist. Dedication , 
commitment. willingness to put themselves on the barricades 
to fight the good battle for a better world. 

Most of us could hardly wait to go to college a nd join the 
struggle, the struggle to make a new world in an atmosphere of 
righteously hip politics. We wanted out of the bounds of high 
school, to migrate to a place from where we could share our 
idea of a good time. Like a young writer wanting to go to Paris 
because that's where Hemingway , Fitzgerald and Dos Passos 
gathered for a time, we wanted into the colleges because it had 
been the place where Tom Hayden, Mark Rudd and Stokely 
Carmichael began. College was a ticket to join the mass 
movement , the Movement meant identification with 
something, and identification meant fashion, conformity and 
easy answers. The anti-war movement was the fraternity we 
wanted to join. It was the thing we were expected to do. 

••• 
On Monday, May 10, 1970, a little after 4 pm, 23-year-old 

George Winnie set fire to himself in Revelle Plaza . He was 
holding a sign that read " In God's Name, End the War." Once 
ablaze, Winnie ran around the Plaza until physics grad student 
Keith Stowe knocked him down and he and others tried to 
smotber his flames with their jackets. Winnie was taken to 
Scripps Hospital , where he died Monday, May 11, at 2 am . 
C08llCious until he died , 11e muttered that his reasons for the act 
were ..... very personal and spiritual." While being pumped 
with.lal'ge doses of morphine, he recited the Lord's Prayer arid 
paru of the scriptures. 

Today marks the ninth anniversary of Winnie's death. He was 
described by acquaintances as "a loner type." One of his 
professors said he had" ... no use for radical political activities. 

Instead~ his way - though he felt antipathy toward the war as 
strongly as any - was to search for answers througb a rationa l 
discussion of issues and understanding of huma n motive ." 

Presumably, faith in rational discussion 'failed for George 
Winnie, though it didn 't diminish his acute feeli ng about the war 
and the destruction of human bei ng in an absurd game of 
power politics. 

War had to be illustrated in such a way that no one could 
mistake the statement of opposition ns something by a wrong-
headed, naive young man who would eventually" grow-up. " In 
o.le small, selfless and ultimatcly in-vain act, George Winnie 
took his stand against the war with a match . No one who still 
remembers him doubts the s incerity he had. George Winnie's 
act was the ultimate gesture, a gesture fcw others were willing 
to make. It was an act you couldn' t rollow. 

.... 

Word of George Winnie hit the La Jolla High campu that 
Tuesday around 3 pm, when classes were letting out. I had 
planned to get stoned with some fri ends and go to San Diego . 
State, where the YoungSocialistAlliancewas sponsoringoneof 
its periodic organizational meetings to band the scattered anti-
war groups into a s trong, unified front. 

George Winnie's nct had suddenly put a damper on the lnte 
a fternoon, and I wouldn ' t have fun at the meeting. Protest had 
taken on new meaning. Winnie's action had come out of som 
deeply rooted turmoil in the depths of his psyche, a battle of 
ethics, morals and spiritual certitude that could only a rticulate 
its rage in action that was direct, to the point and unmistakable 
in tenor. 

Winnie proved braver than anyone in the protest lines, in the 
seized buildings. at the teach-ins or in the basements making 
bombs. He was an act no one could follow . H he didn 't stop the 
war, he at least did contribute to eliminating the frat-house 
mentality that gave anti-war affair a carnival almo phere. 
The shame is that it took hi life to teach some people that 
lesson,

Letters to the Editor 

Silly Student Lacks Guts 
Editor: 

I want to complain about the 
lack of guts shown by one very 
silly student: Cindy Biondi. If 
she wanted the office, then she 
should at least have the 
courage to slick it out. She 
wanted the support of the 
students of UCSD , a nd she got 
it; 44 percent of it! How can she 
back down now? 

We of the Backgammon and 
ribbage Club (BCC) were 

actua lly looking forward to 

having some real leader hip in 
our tudent government. Just 
when everything look like it· 
gonna turn out okay , something 
always screws up . Why the hell 
did the silly students run if 
they ' re not going to be silly?! 
Ci ndy Biondi has suddenly 
turned serious. If one doesn't 
want to be totally silly, then one 
shouldn 't be silly at all. 

Ci ndy Biondi reflects the 
very attitude she 's trying to 
parody: apathy. If she wants to 

do something, then she should 
go out and do it until it's over: 
she should do it all the way . 
Cindy Biondi seemed to turn 
her back on what she be li eved, 
ror just when her cam paign got 
going, she s lowed down . or 
rather went " half fast. "

inflated as much <IS possible -
to rcmind everyone that we are 
working hard on Dayc are 

Expansion. Th e parents a re 
currently developing plans for 
both immediate and long-range 
expansion. plilns which we hope 
will serve the childcare needs 
of UCSD parents and the 
research and instructional 
needs of students and faculty. 

Finally. we will have a sign-
up sheet aVil ii able at the picnic 
for any UCSD students who · 
would like to volunteer a coupl e 
of hours a week at the Daycare 
Center this ummer. We will be 
tt'aining new staff members 
thi summer and will need 
extra hands to help out during 
our in-service training periods . 
Summertime is our lime for 
field trips, so if you think it

'Central' Abortion Funding 
Problem is Responsible Sex 
Editor: 

Ms . Scozzaro overlook the 
central problem in federal 
funding for abortions. That is 
the apparent belief by some 
that sexual gratification is a 
" right" and that pregnancies 
resulting from ill-planned or 
un-planned sexual encounters 
should be terminated at the 
taxpayer ' expense. 

I don 't think anyone will 
argue with federal funding for 
women who are raped, are 
victim of incest. or will 
possibly die during childbirth. 
However, those women and 
girls who are too lazy, too 
indecisive, too unrealistic, or 
too stupid to protect themselves 
from unwanted pregnancies 

should dea l with their problems 
themselves. As has been 
asserted by m any pro-abo rtion 
groups, the matter of abo rtion 
should be between a woman 
and her doctor. I certainly do 
not want my tax dollar going 
for this purpose. 

I would al 0 like to point out 
that there is a bundant free and 
low-cost birth control available 
nationwide. many places even 
supplying birth control to 
teenagers , It would be criminal 
if abortion became a form of 
birth control in America as it 
has in Japan and Russia, where 
it is not uncommon for a woman 
(0 have several abortions even 
before marriage.

Review of 
Baldwin 
Sees Things 
All Wrong 

Editor : 
I ha ve just'finished the art icle 

by Ted Burke regarding Mr . 
Baldwin 's appear<Jnce at 

CSD. 
I find it hard to believe that 

Mr. Burke was attending the 
a rne talk . Aside from the fact 

that all of the quotes were out of 
contex t, Mr. Burke's inter-
pretation is to me stra nge. 

I. persona lly found in Mr . 
Baldwin a man who is tota ll y 
aware of the Black American 
·ituation . Today's Black 
Am~ricans are in a st<lte of 
limbo. Mr . Baldwin isjustwhat 
is needed to sha ke the limbo . 

In my opi nion Mr. Burke's 
artic l is typical of th e 
sarcastic attitude of many 
people towards Blacks. It was 
bad e nough that when a man of 
Mr . Baldwin's statu re appear 
on our campus, and the only 
publicity was a picture and 
caption inside The Guardian. 
Aside from this. is the article by 
Ted Burke. To me this is just 
another article printed by The ' 
Guardian that implies racism 
or is blatantly racist.

will not be able to escape rising 
costs t hat motorists feel 
especially victim to if the San 
Diego Ci ty Council approves 
the fare increase reques ted by 
bu . company officia ls. 

In a move the company has 
threatened for everal months, 
the transit system ' board of 
directors voted Wednesday to 
include a m odera t e fare 
increase in its next budget 
which, pending Co un ci l 
approval, will take effect July 
I. 

The fare increa e will include 
raising regular fares from 40 to 
50 cents and will increase 
Saverpa 'es, currently at 5]6 
per month, to 522.50 each 
month , according to company

Snoble. Express Saverpasse

If you or your spouse are emplOyed 
through UCSD you're eligible to take

530 per month. 

The 10 s of $4 million from 
this year 's and all further 
budget due to Proposi tion 13 
and " a lot of increa ing co I " 
convinced transit official to 
approve the fare increase , said 
Snoble. 

Snoble a id t he present 
energy shortage is partly to 
blame for the company's need 
to increase th fare. F uel 
price , which have risen by 30 
percent in the pa t six weeks, 
have added $1.1 million to nex t

according to Snoble. As a 
result, the company needs to 
su ppl em ent fund s which , 
despite the fal'e increase, " still 
won't get us back to the service 
before Prop. 13, " Snoble said. 

The new budget also calls for 
some add itional bus services 
and the reinstatement of routes 
cut in J anuary , i ncluding route 
21. which serves the Del Mar, 

UCSD and Mira Mesa area, 
according to Snoble. 

As part of the added services, 
route 21 will be doubled in ride 
frequencie from its original 
hourly stop to halfhourcycles, 
Snob Ie sa id. "There's good 
ridership up there," Snoble 
sa id of the UCSD area, " It has 
the be t ridership of all the 
campuses (in San Diego) ." 

Other route in the UCSD 
ar ea could receive a boost 
in services if a contingency 
plan included in the budget is 
approved. Both routes 30 and 34 
are part of a contingency 
scheme which would add bus 
services necessitated by the 
gas shortage and resultant 
ridership increase, according 
to Snoble, 

Figures from last Monday 's 
and Tuesday's bus services 
show that an average of 3,200 
additional persons used the 
transit system tholie days, a 
ridership increase of three 
percent, said Snoble.

Reg .Fees May Go To

(Continued from page I ) 
proposed in response to the 
post-Proposition 13 state cuts. 

The only significant change 
from the steps originally 
proposed was in the library 
budget, where plans to cut back 
library hour were ordered 
scrapped, according to Bob 
Oakes, campus budget analyst 
and chair of the ad hoc 
committee. 

In addition, it was agreed 
that $100,000 of expected relief 
for tbe campus budget should 
be held in reserve. 

The proposed transfer of 
salaries from the state to the 
re,istratlon fee budget 
cate,ories will amount to 
$1111.000. 

Five .,.Itions, including the 
auoclate vice chancellor for 
student affairs. were named 
for transfer. The others were in 
career Planning and Plac~ 
ment and International 
Education . . 

Reaction to the change was 
DOt entirely De,ative. at least 
on the record. 

"Students BSseSS themselves 
fees. and so maybe they should 
be tOldl, immune from 
Propoellion 13." argues Kenzie 
Nicoli. chairman of the Re, Fee 
Committee. 

Ann Carberry. out-gOiRg AS 
vice pr:esldent and a member 
of the ad hoc committee. said 
though cuts in student services 

would hurt. cuts in other areas 
might be worse. 

"I'm glad Reg Fees weren't 
excluded ," Carber ry said . 
''I'm looking at how much it 
would hurt if more were taken 
from the faculty or TA·s." 

To compe nsa te for the 
transfer, which included 
$25,000 in ac ros -the-board 
expenses, the regu lar Reg Fee 
budget is elimi nating or 
keeping open $99 ,335 in 
positions in the vice chancellor 
of student affairs' office. Also, 
$10 ,000 for the Student 
Handbook , $5,000 from the 
Student Affirmative Action 
budget will be cut, a long with 
$J5,665 across the board. 

Student Affairs was not the 
only section of the budget which 
received cuts Figured from a 
base signiricantly expanded by 
the additio n of non-s tate 
sources. 

The School of Medicine 
budget includes a half million 
dollars of federal "capitation 
grants" which have been given 
since the decade began in order 
to encourage medical schools to 
grow, according to Bob Oakes, 
campus budget analyst and 
chairman of the ad hoc 
committee. 

"Believe it or not, there is a 
rationale for including these 
(non-state) funds, " Oakes said.

Coalition Formed 

Teach-in Calls for 'Action~ 
By John Klock 

Senior Siaff Writer 
What was billed as a tenure 

teach-in Wednesday night 
turned into an organizational 
meeting for the Coalition for 
Quality Education, formed on 
the spot to IJUrsue " strategy 
and tactics" on tenure issues . 

"We were anticipating more 
people," Jon Bekken, com· 
missioner·elect of student 
welfare, said. 

About 25 students came to 
Student Center Building C and 
heard an explanation of the 
power structure that makes 
tenure decisions. and then 
discussed what should be done 
about current cases and the 
tenure process. 

They also heard names of 
several professors being 
considered fo r tenure, in 
addition to the celebra ted cases 
of Robert Edelman. Bud 
Mehan, Mike Real and Emory 
Tolbert. 

" Direct action" such as a sit-
in was advocated by some, but 
when the session closed the only 
commitments were to less 
drastic actions. 

Individuals agreed to work 
on: a petition for the firing of 
P aul Saltman. vice chancellor 
of academic affairs ; an 
anonymous survey of the 
attitudes concerning tenure of 
professors here: contacts with 

faculty unions , campus clubs 
and other UC campuses: letter 
lo the legislature : a nd a 
pamphlet that would expla in 
tenure i ues. 

They also decided to gather 
more information about other 
systems, suc h as a five-year 
contract , which might replace 
tenure. 

" Tenure generales fear ," 
Barry Hyma n , out-going 
co mmi ssioner of student 
welfare said. Many tudents 
told of professors unwilliug to 
talk to groups of students 
about the tenure process for 
fear of risking their own 
position. 

Several agreed that pro-
fessors a re eager to talk one-on-
one to- students about their 
opinions of the process. 

Differences of opinion 
urfaced on how much shou ld 

be done and how fast. Several 
ad ' ocated concentrating 
on limited goals. others argued 
for trying, even if they could not 
s ucceed, to change the entire 
system. 

A meeting scheduled 10. next 
Wednesday at 7 pm will address 
the question of what aclion 
should be taken and when, and 
hear repOlts fro m thos who took 
on specific jobs.

Triton golfers weathered

while po ting a sixth place 
finish in the ea on-ending 
NAIA district III golftourney at 
Sobobo Springs Country Club. 

Jim M iller led the effort with 
an 80-82 ( 162) , eight strokes off 
the lead . UCSO as a team

last year' . " hLld a tough timc" 
according to oach Joe Owen . 
He struggled over the first 
eighteen with a 90. but cume 
back strong with an 82 for the 
fina l eighteen . 

Harris Fran kel had the best 
s hot at di s trict honors, sa id 
Wernick. He was five shots off 
the pace at 83 the first time 
a round. Frankel fired into the 
fina l eighteen, " playing very 
well on the front nine , but just 
exploded on the buckside," 
pulling him back in the pack 
with an 86 , according to 
Wel'l1ick. 

District powerhou e USIU 
was clo e ly followed by Triton 
nemesis Dominguez I-Ulls. A 
surprise was Point Loma's 
third place finish . A team that 
was crunched by UCSD ear'lier

its youth should be a threat next

" We never really hit our

Frankel.

Owens labeled USIU , USD, 
Dominguez Hills and Point

next year. With a few incoming 
playe rs "we should be able to

Next year may offer an 
unwelcome obstacle for Triton 
golfers . " We might be a victim

Threat to Subjects Weighed 
Committee Checks Research for Physical, Psychological Risks 

By Doug Campion 
Science Editor 

Understanding the workings of 
the human mind requires a 
good deal of delicate probing. 
After all of the requirements 
outlined by the university and 
the government for proteCting 
human subjects in psychology 
experiments, according to Dr. 
Norbert Kerr, professor of 
psychology , " The most 
important element is the 
experimenter keeping in mind 
that these are other people that 
he's dealing with - that there's 
more than just the knowledge to 
be gained that's at stake." 

The law requires a special 
committee to review any 
government-funded research 
involving humah subjects in 
order to ensure the people's 
protection. 

According to ' UCSD policy, 
though, "all research involving 
human subjects - whether it is 

funded federally, funded non-
federally or unfunded - is to be 
reviewed and not done until 
approved by the campus 
committee," said Kerr. 

The Human Subjects 
Committee consists of one 
policy subcommittee and two 
review sub-committees, one of 
which examines propo ed 
biomedical experimentation on 
humans and the other, of which 
Kerr is a member, deals with 
similar work in the social and 
behavioral sciences. 

The committee, which 
reports to the Vice Chancellor 
of Health Science, must 
determine the amount of 
physical , psychological and 
social risk to the subjects of 

' each proposed research 
project. The Policy a nd 
Procedure Manual for the 
protection of human subjects 
defines each of these three.

research. 

According to Kerr, the group, 
composed of faculty as well as 
what he called " non-academic 
members." work to determine 
the import a nce of the 
knowledge th at will be gained 
by the performa nce of each 
experime,nL Then a judgment 
is made as to whether or not the 
acquiring of that information 
justifies the risks . 

The majority of psychology 
experiments here , though , 
entail very little risk to the 
human subject , according to 
Kerr. "The worst risk seems to 
be maybe one of boredom." he 
said, "maybe one of fatigue." 

Researchers obtain subject 
volunteers in several different 
ways. Some people are paid for 
the time they spend at a 
research task and sometimes.

subjected to the whims of 
psychological study trends ? 
Oth er s tudent , pri ma rily 
graduates, as part of the 
dep a rtment 's graduate 
program. 

According to Norbert Kerr, 
assistant profe sor of psy-
chology , mostly graduate 
students and senior honors 
thesis students are eligible to 
run their own experiments, 
working under the advisement 
of a facuHy member. 

To become an honors thesis 
student, the student talks to a 
faculty member during their 
junior year about what he or 

she wants to do. The following 
fall the student begins 
researching and experi -
menting with the chosen topic. 

Steve Breckler. who is 
working on his honors thesis, 
commented that " projects are 
often pi c k e d for th eir 
edJ,icational va lue" because the 
progra m is designed to teach 
Lndergradua tes how to' run 
ex periments. The rc ult , 
therefore , a re rarely published .• 

Professor McClelland says 
that a publication of a honors 
thesis is rare because of the 
length of time spent on them_ 
" Occasiona lly ," he added. "a 
student will come in with an 
experi ment a lready under-
way," which will sometimes be 
up for publica tion by the end of 
the year. 

The fact that most projects 
are chosen fortheireducational 
value does not mitigate the 
variety of topics at a ll.

SO, 

Experiments such a human 
agg ress ion , emotion com-
munica tion., a nd observing 
which key the pigeon taps all 
come under the auspice of the 
honors thesis program. 

Much of the work is done with 
compute rs, as in the CLlse of 
hum a n agg ress ion ex peri-
ments . In one situation. the 
experimenter works with a 
confederate who trie to annoy 
the subject. The subject is first 
given a chance to verbally 
agres , a nd then a chance to 
ret a li a te by judging th e 
co nfederate in a teacher / 
learner situation. The subject 
indicates displeasure with a 
blast of noise , and this is 
evaluated with the other data 
the experimenter has collected. 

Two theories ' a re being 
worked .with here. The first is 
that if a person has a chance to 
show aggression, as time goes 
on, the amount of aggression

will les en. The other theory 
says that given the same 
circumstances, the amount will 
increase_ 

An experiment being done 
that use questionna ires ra ther 
than computer is a study in 
e motion communication . In 
this situation , a video tape was 
made of actors acting out 14 
different emotion The ubject 
then goes through a process of 
fir t listening to the tape while 
the actors recite the "Pledge of 
Allegiance" in the various 
emotions. then seeing just the 
face of the actor, and then just 
the body. After each viewing 
the subject is asked to write 
down what emotion they think 
they 've seen and how real it is_ 

G ra dua le s tudent& are a ble to 
go into much more detail with 
their research because it is 
generally all concentrated in 
one area of study _ According to

undergraduates . 

Be::ause of the inferiority of 
lower education available to 
South African Blacks, the 
universities may find itdiCficult 
to rind qualified Blacks, Ryer 
remarked. 

In South African primary and 
secondary seho'ols for Blacks, 
Ryer said, only one-sixteeth of 

the amount of money spent in 
white schools is available. In 
addition. many of the teacher 
in the Black schools do not even 
have the equivalent of a high 
sehool diploma, he added. 

RyeI' was re lu c tant to

Both Byrd and Majer. who

According to Byrd , "the

Film/Ted Burke 

Allen's Thesis Works in 'Manhattan' 
Though his admirers might chide me 

for this, I've always found Woody Allen 
to be something of a latter-day, Jerry 
Lewis. Like Lewis. AlIen 's on-film 
persona is a paranoid projection of an 
innocence lost in a world that conspires 
to put him in the worst light. Allen, like 
Lewis, is someone so lacking in finesse , 
agi lity. or aptitude in the world of the 
well·heeled tha t most attempts to 
emulate chi·chi mannerisms are 
doomed to failure and humiliation. 

This theme runs throughout all of 
Al len's films, with a central 
preoccupation with sex . Allen rarely 
gets any, and when he does, it never 
come off as the instruction ma nuals or 
the Playboy PbjlQsq~ promised. 
Allen, in a way, presenYhimself as a 
victim of the sexual revolution 's 
propaganda, someone furiously trying 
to ma ke his re lationships with women 
ad here to a set of rose-hued promises. 

- 7 
The preceding a bstraction of Allen's 

themes goes deeper : of course, than 
what one could extrapolate from Jerry 
Lewis (though well-meaning critics, 

(mostly French, have tried to make a 
case for him) , and Allen, currently the 
media 's favorite conspicuously 
intellectua l film-ma ker , has expanded 
his theme into a broader, deeper, 
murkier tableux. Manhattan, his new 
comedy. is something of a treatise on 
what's wrong with modern man : a lack 

.:,.f moral certitude, the silence of God 
and man's attempt to fill the void with 
his own concepts, the meaninglessness 
of language, the obsession with surface 
and the lack of spiritual reflection. All 
these strands, culled from the books of 

• TOlstO*, Sarlre , Burroughs and 
especiaTy the films of Bergman, are all 
touched on in the course of the film . 
Luckily, Allen, the writer and director. 
has developed a perfectlY.....c.Q..here!!1 
lLj~yal st~ a nd a sense of dialogil'el'!'lat 
ma kes the film less foreboding than it 
sounds. 

The slory revolves around someone 

named Isaac Davis (Allen) , a higtif,aid 
writer of a trendy TV comedy who quits 
his job so he can work on a novel 
exposing the spiritual vacuity 'Of the 
denizens of Manhattan. He is divorced 
from his bisexual wife, who left him for 
another woman, and who is writing a 
memoir tha t reveals the touchiest 
aspects of their relationships. Davis has 
taken up with a seventeen-year-old girl 
named Tracy (Mariel Hemingway), a 
bright teenager who loves Davis but 
whose love he rejects in the interest of a 
writer named Mary (Diane Keaton), 
who is currently dating his best friend , 
the already-married Yale (Michael 
Murphy), on the sly. Davis waits for the 
two to break up before he makes his 
move . Mary a nd Davis finally get 
together, Davis breaks the relationship 
with Tracy but, a fter two weeks, Mary 
and Yale are seeing each other agai n, 
leav ing Davis in the cold. Davis rushes 
to catch Tracy, on her way to England to 
attend school , a nd the two rekindle their 
rela tionshi p. 

I That , fundamentally , is the plot from 
beginning to end . Though the 
particulars don' t promise much at first , 
Allen's 'Memorex ear for dialogue 
makes Manhauan o'lL.,.oJ.,phe better 
serio-comic films in ~'years. The 
characters are well -educated 
professionals, mostly writers, who walk 
around New York City's haunts -
Central Park, Greenwich Village. 
uptown publisher parties - rattling off 
vague utterances that sound nice but 
which evaporate under close 
inspection. At a pro·ERA benefit Davis 
listens to a novelist who tells the 
theme behind his new book to an 

~. udience of enthralled listeners. " This woman has never had an orgasm," says the writer, "she suffers from the quintessentia l emptiness of the 
age. She meets a man who is a ll essence. 
They ma ke love. She ha an orgasm, 
and then she dies." 

"r ha d an orgasm once," pipes in a 
comely but vacant-eyed blonde, " but

'Gilligan's Island' Revival Reassures Fans 
F or a television series to be recalled fondly years 

after its cancellation, it 
must have once offered its 
viewers something enjoyable 
and valuable. Shows like this 
come and go - millions I 'm 
sure still remember th e 
original "Honeymooners," 
·'Twillght Zone," " Star Trek" 
and the " Mary Tyler Moore 
Show" with affection . As 
curious as it may seem, 
" GlIIlgan's Island" has a place 
on this list as well. 

Yes, you read me correctly. 
During its several-year run in 
the mid -1960s "Gilligan 's 
Is land" attracted a following 
that apparently still exists 

today, a NBC saw fit to revive 
the show for a specia l90-minute 
segme nt l ast Thur s d ay 
evening, There are discern-
ible reasons for " GI's " lasting 
popularity. In its admittedly 
lowbrow way, the program 
presented its viewers with a 
model society and archetypal 
characters (the sturdy leader-
figure , the plutocrat, the 
sc holar , t he sex pot ) a nd 
showed how these dispara te 
individuals could survive in an 
a lien (though not altogether 
unpleasa nt) environment. The 
"Gilligan 's Is land" theme of 
ordinary men a nd women 
challenged by primeval forces 
is a lmost Conradian , a tale of 
human adaptatiol) and struggle 

FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM 
NOW OPEN 

o 
The President's Undergraduate Fellowship 
Program Competition for 1979-80 is now 
open. This competition has grown in 
popularity among UC San Diego students 
since its inception in 1967, The program is 
designed to assist unusually talented 
undergraduate students to carry out special 
studies and projects under faculty 
supervision during term time and/or 
vacation. Such projects may include 

research and/or other creative activities. 

Another fellowship has · been added to the 
competition, in the name of David Jay 
Gambee. David was a Revelle student who 
was killed in a traffic accident just prior to the 
1978-79 academic year, The ' fellowship, 
established in memory of David, will be 
awarded with preference toa student doing a 
project in 'an area in which David was 
interested, namely, naturalists study in 

Yosemite, student government, or music. 

Fellowship applications are available· in

year-old mind. 

"Cas taways on Gilligan 's 
Is land " last week conti nued the 
story of the S.s . Minnow 's crew 
and passengers, reassembling 
the program's origina l cast 
(except for Tina Louise) for the 
occasion . Longtime ·,iewers of 
the series received reas -
surance soon after the s how 
began that the script would 
conti nue the "GI" tradition of 
sim pl e-mi nd ed s lapst ic k 
humor and wordplay . It was 
somewhat distressing to see 
what the years have done to 
Bob Denver, the actor who will 
car r y to hi s grave a n 
identific a tion :with the 
supposedly ever-youthful sa ilor 

Gilligan. Denver has been 
playi ng in TV sitcoms for about 
twenty years a nd hi s face now 
carries a haggard look. To his 
credit , though , he tried last 
Thursday to act every bit as 
adolescenUy dumb as eve r, a t 
various times poking, shoving 
and shooti ng at people out of 
sheer clumsiness. A classic 
existentia l figure, Gilligan is 
the Irresponsible Man, the 
irredeemable screw-up who 
wins the sympathy of all, 

As he usually was during the 
run of the series, Gilligan was 
the moral center of this 
te leplay . When thE' castaways 
tried to flee their island on 
boa rd a rickety old plane, 
Gilligan rai ed a n ethical
