Jackson 
rallies his 
faithful 
By SABRINA YOUMANS 
Stlfll WrIt..-

A crowd of I,SOO waited three 
hours for 1988 presidential candi-
date Jesse Jackson Tueaday at 
Balboa Park for his first major 
rally in San Diego, where he 
focused on a need for improved 
Mexican-American relations. 

A diverse crowd of Latinos, 
Blacks, gay activists, students, 
and union workers waited patient-
ly while Jackson was delayed by 
last-minute campaigning in 
Oregon , which he lost to 
Dukakia. 

Jackson stumped for 40 
minutes with a tailor- alie 
speech for the border city which 
focused on Mexican-American 
relations and the importance of 
developing the Mexican econ-
omy. "Mexico is not back door-
Mexico is next door. We're 
neighbors," Jackson said. He 
added, "When it rains in Mexico, 
it tends to get wet in California. 
When the sun shines in Mexico, 
we tend to feel the heat in 
California. " 

Rev. Jackson suuested imple-
menting a plan in Latin America 
similar to the Marshall Plan that 
poured billions of dollars into 
Europe following World War II. 
"It's better to ha~e prosperous 
neighbors instead of impover-
ished neighbors. As long as there 
is poverty in Latin America there 
will be a crisis on our border." 

The dynamic speaker had the 
crowd cheering as he stressed the 
cultural diversity and unity of 
both countries: "We both lin

The Che Cafe is now open for business after a rally held Monday to protest University actions. 

Passes health inSRection 

Carruthers backs down at 
protest; Che remains open 

By A.M. BEZZERIDES 
AU«Mtte NfttI' Edit", 

The Chc Cafc co-op success-
fully defied an administrative 
order to close last weekend when 
they opened for a breakfast rally 
Monda, morning, and it appears 
the cafe will be open indefinitely. 

The rally drew about 100 Che 
Cafe co-op members and sup-
porters. After a threatened march 
on his office, University Center 
Director Jim Carruthers met the 
group at the Che amidst signs 
calling him a "rat" and demand-
ing his dismissal. 

After two hours of often in-
tense discussion, Carruthers 
backed down from his earlier 

IIRats don't know the 
issues, they just know 
that they want to eat." 

-Jim Carruthers 
University Center 

Director 

decision and agreed to open the 
Che pending an Environmental 
Health and Safety (EHAS) in-
spection that afternoon. 

In addition to the EH&.S in-
spection (which the Che passed), 
Carruthers also stipulated that a 

county health inspector make 
suuestions yesterday on how to 
combat the Che-acknowledged 
rodent problem. 

The county inspector, Jim 
Shoemake said that it looked 
like much of the problem had 
been taken care of, and "it looks 
like the people there [at the Che] 
and the University are working 
well together." 

Che member and spokesperson 
Keith Abouaf made three de-
mands Monday: (1) keep the 

. Che open; (2) develop a compre-
hensive maintenance plan to 
prevent rodents' from entering 
the kitchen and Che complex; 
and (3) initiate better University 
Center Board and Che communi-
cation. 

Carruthers told the rally, "In 
terms of opening, we all have the ' 
same goaL .. Rats don't know 
the issues. They just want to eat. 
I acknowledge that there has 
been a tremendous amount of 
effort on behalf ofthe Che, but I 
don't think the remedial methods 
worked." 

EH&'S inspector Bill Barnard, 
who conducted the Che inspec-
tion on Monday, said the rat 
problem was the result of Che 
negligence. 

"1 think we had a very serious 
problem because the people down 
there [Che members] weren't 
paying close attention to the 
condithns," Barnard said. How-

ever, Barnard added that the 
Che passed his inspection because 
of all the work the Che had done 
in the meantime. 

In an interview yesterday, 
Carruthers said that although it 
is the Che's responsibility to 
"keep an environment that 
doesn't promote rats," he ad-
mitted that efforts on both sides 
were not sufficient. 

According to Abouaf, the Che 
and the University agreed that 
the University would be respon-
sible for sealing the kitchen from 
rodents and that the Che would 
be responsible for keeping the 
kitchen clean. 

Abouaf said that the University 
did not live up to its end of the 
deal. "I told Jim Carruthers that 
it was reliance on him and his 
staff that led to the perpetuation 
of the problem." Abouat said. 

Carruthers replied, "I don't 
think there is a clean line of 
responsibility - it's a dual 
responsibility. I don't want to be 
in a position of pointing fingers." 

Although he said that he felt 
sorry for Carruthers in the rally, 
and he did not like to see his 
(Carruthers') name dragged 
through the mud, Abouaf said, 
"I still believe that there is an 
intention of the University to 
contain the co-ops and reduce 
their power and size."

Crabtree 
to face 
new trial 
By DAVID BROOKS 
Sttd/ Write 

Overruling a lower court's 
decision, a Federal Appeals court 
on Friday reversed a dismissal 
against UCSD junior Kristen 
Crabtree, who had been charged 
with felony assault after biting 
FBI agent, M.arene Allison. 
Crabtree will have to face charges 
again on an undetermined date. 

Last August, the Ninth Circuit 
District Court had dismissed 
charges against Crabtree after 
concluding that "no reasonable 
juror could find that Crabtree 
assaulted Allison or that Crabtree 
used unreasonable force." 

In reinstating tbe assault 
charge, the Appeals Court claim-
ed that presiding District Court 
Chief Judge Gordon Thompson 
Jr. "exceeded [his] authority" by 
dismissing the charges during 
pre-trial motions. The bigher 
court agreed tbat "the district 
court's assessment of the insuf-
ficiency of the government's 
evidence may well be correct;" 
however, Judge Thompson's 
decision was premature. 

The Appeals Court criticized 
the prosecuting U.S. Attorney's 
office for not devoting time "to 
more mentorious prosecutions" 
while at the same time "sym-
pathiz[ing] with the district 
cOurt." In fact, the Appeals Court 
agreed that ". judgment of 
acqufttal could well be war-
ranted" if the same facts pre-
sented at the hearing were pre-
sented at the later court date. 

The Crabtree-Allison confron-
tation took place last May 14 
during an on-campus career fair.

"A Great Wall" and "Becoming 
American" to be shown Friday 

The political film series continues May 20 with a 
showing of" A Great Wall" and "Becoming 
American."

Student rides too much 
Tipsy Taxi services drained AWomans 

Choice ... By DAVID BROOKS sut/ Writ". 
A.S. President Maynard Dim-

mesdale announced last night 
that UCSD's "Tipsy Taxi" service 
had been "drained" by one stu-
dent, completely ending the ser-
vice until the end of the year. 

Accordina to Dimmesdale, the 
student whOle identity was not 
disclosed, repeatedly used the 
contracted taxi service as per-
sonal transportation, incurring 
charges to the A.S. Service of 
approximately $650. As a result 
of these charges, Dimmesdale 
announced that the service must 
be cancelled. 

Charges 
Contl.nued from pale 1 
According·to a court document 
filed last Friday, Agent Anison 
was seated at an FBI career 
information table when Crabtree 
began photographina her. Agent 
Allison asked Crabtree to stop 
takina pictures when she was 
convinced that Crabtree and 
fellow students ·"intended to 
provoke an incident with her 
which Crabtree would capture 
on film. "Once "Crabtree made it 
clear that she intended to con-
tinue takiJla phot0Ir&Phs," Aaent 
Allison tried to forcibly remove 
the camera from Crabtree in 
order to "pin control of the 
situation." At this point, after a 
brief struuIe, Agent Allison was 
bitten on the finger by Crabtree. 

When asked for comment 
concernina the reinstatement of 
assault charges apinst Crabtree, 
FBI Special Aaent James 
Bolenbach said that the issue 
"was not an FBI matter" and is 
"a court matter that has to do 
with the Court of Appeals." 

Crabtree commented that she 
was simply "waitina [for the case] 
to go back to trial." 

Her attorlley, Bart Sheela III, 
stated that "the government 
created the crime," and added, 
"there is no way in tbe world that 
the aovernment could win in 
front ofa fair jury." 

In an unrelated issue, the A.S. 
announced that a shuttle service 
will operate durina the holiday 
season, transportina resident 
students to the airport. 

A.S. Vice President External 
Mordecai Potash informed the 
Council that Iric Vonn Spears, 
A.S. SAAC Outreach Program 
Director, has been asked to assist 
U.C. Berkeley and University of 
Nevada-Las Veps in establishina 
similar prosrams. 

UCSD's Outreach Prosram is 
a student run organization that 
travels to Southern California 
High Schools and Community 
Colleges and discusses college 
opportunities with underrepre-

sented students. 
The A.S. annual budset, re-

portedly in the 5530,000 range, 
was submitted by President Dim-
mesdale and referred to the 
Finance Committee. 

In other financial matters, the 
African American Student Union 
received SI,314 in seneral ~lIo­
cation funds for a black student 
ceremony to be held on June 
12th.

"Condemn'd to drudge, 
" The meanest of the mean, 
"Andfurbishfalsehoodsfor a magazine." 

- Lord Byron 
English Bards and Scotch Reviewers 

T here are some things they don't warn you about in journalism school, a lot of things, in fact, and nothing I can say here is going to change that or cure it. There are some things you don't 
need to hear at the tender age of 19 or 20 not even from me. 

I never went to journalism school, and none of my friends did 
either, but I get paid to give lectures at these schools now and then, 
and when I do I try to be straight. There is no need to heap any more 
baloney on these poor buggers than they already have to grapple 
with. 

Some people will tell them that if they are smart and work hard 
and always be honest, they will get rich and famous and maybe even 
powerful in this business ... or, if not rich and famous and powerful, 
at least "comfortable" and "professionally satisfied" and "fulfilled" 
in some vaguely human way that we can unde~tand but which can be 
only be recognized and truly grasped by those who get there - those 
who study hard and love honor and tell the truth with a fearless zeal 
and always sleep witb virgins instead of whores and fight like wild 
beasts for the rights of the weak and the poor and the doomed . . . . 

If you do all ofthese things and love all ofthese truths and earn all 
of these blood-spattered little merit badges then you will walk on the 
shining path and feel tall and stroll in the world and never get crazy or 
fat unless you somebow get stuck on the rewrite desk . ... 

But not me. J know better than to peddle base, low and tragic lies 
not even for money, which is the mother's milk of this trade. 

There are other terrible tragedies that can ruin your life in this 
business, and I know about most of them because I have been here 
awhile, or at least long enough to be known for my family motto: 
"Twenty-five years with no job, 26 years with no sleep." 

It is a sleazy escutcheon and we are not especially proud of it, but 
on most nights it is all we have in the way of family pride ... And even 
then there are some things we can't talk about. There are black holes 
and pitfalls in this business that would break the heart of a turkey 
vulture and somehow there is no way to avoid them, no matter how 
smart you are or how many years you put in. 

It is the nature of the business, and nobody who takes it seriously is 
safe: The editor of the New York Times can be conned, humiliated 
and bamboozled just as easily as any club reporter from the Middle-
to wn Daily News. We are all suckers for the light at the end of the 
tunnel, and the best of us are the worst suckers of all, because we still 
"believe." 

T hat is what happened to me the other day. I was hunkered down at the far corner of the bar, reading a legal paper on the current status of child abuse, white slavery and incest among 
families in Phoenix who hire their housekeepers out of orphanages in 
Mexico, when suddenly the noon news came on and the TV erupted 
with a kinky little talc about President Reagan's bizarre dependency 
on astrological gibberish , moon signs, fortune-tellers and even horo-
scope columns in cheap weekly newspapers. 

I am not much into astrology, but when I bear CNN's Bernard 
Shaw saying that the president has such a deep and perfect faith in it 
that about half of the White House daily schedule summit conferen-
ceS with Gorbachev and major political decisions were apparently 
based on things like the exact location ofthe third star in the handle 
of the Big Dipper at midnight on Groundhog Day, there was no way 
to ignore it . 

News like that doesn't come around every Wednesday that the 
president of the United States gets most of his high-level advice from 
a stargazer in San Francisco. 

That is weird news. There is nQ way to come to grips with it and still 
feel normal. If the ship o(state is in fact a slave to the placement of 
of Betelgeuse on the high side of Orion when the moon \.:villes up on 
Monday, then we all have a certain unexpected or even unnatural 
reality on our hands ... and what if Bellatrix slinks behind a small 
cloud on the night before Reagan plans to fly to Miami and person-
ally deliver $66 million in a brown bag to some half-brig~t Latino? 

W e have known this all along. But it reminded me of the president's other mystic phenomenon - his unshakable belief in the Book of Revelation and also his conviction that 
this generation may be the one that will face "the end of the world." 
He said that to a reporter from People magazine as far back as 
December 1985, and he has never seen any reason to explain himself 
not even when negotiating nuclear death-bomb treaties. 

At that point a' geek stood up at the other end of the bar and 
started ravmg about the Book of IUvelation in a style so precise and 
so feverish, directly at me, that I felt queasier than the wedding guest 
assaulted by the bearded lunatic in the Rime ofthe Ancient Mariner. 

"That's it!" he screamed. "The end of the world will come on May 
28. I have the proof right here in my sack." . 

Shaken by the wild glitter in his eyes, I offered him $4,000 in cash 
to come up to the house and tell me his story on tape. It seemed 
logical at the time. 

Nine hours later, after listening to 5is madness, and in the throes of 
a hate-filled nervous breakdown, I caUed the sheriff and had him 
taken away. He was a monster, a fanatic , and I was a fool at least 
until May 28 : It might happen . Every once in a while one of these 
loonies will teU you the truth. We are, after all , professionals. 

Letters 
Saier 
a Relic 
Editor: 

This letter is in reply to Dr. 
Milton Saier's commentary 
[Guardian, May 12). 

I am disgusted by professors 
who had their prime in the sixties 
implying that I do not core about 
being stifled by bureaucratic 
brick walls, and that my genera-
tion is making no valuable con-
tributions to our own intellec-
tual and social heritage. 

Of course I resent the bureau-
cratic difficulties that complicate 
my education at UCSD. Of 
course I care about what is hap-
penina to student-professor rela-
tions. Who cares more than the 
students? 

The students at UCSD are a 
new type of reactionaries. We 
don't organize mass demonstra-
tions anymore in order to act our 
point across (which, by the way, 
would be especially difficult on 
this "riot-proof" campus). 

The students have attempted, 
for several years now, to make 
improvements - in particular, 
by revising some T.A. policies 
and improving the parking situa-
tion - but it has been difficult. 

Hopefully, with the new A.S., 
things will change. I'm not hold-
ing my breath for these changes, 
but, meanwhile, do not criticize 
us for not trying. How dare you! 

communication students were 
banging drums and marching 
down. to the administrative com-
plex? Yeah, I know, midterms 
are enough to make you want to 
forget about everything, espe-
cially if its got to do with educa-
tion. Still, let me jog our collec-
tive memories for a moment.

Ai-ii turns out, all that energy 
didn't just razzle out over the

found that this IS not the first 
time that students have taken up 
the issue of decision-making

Uni()n 
Continued from pale .. 
efforts the Communication Stu-
dent Union has now been revived 
as the vehicle for communica-
tion students to actively partici-
pate in their education. We are 
an independent, democratic, stu-
dent organization that aims to 
bring students in the communi-
cation department together to 
collectively voice educational 
ideas and needs, participate in 
the decision-making process, 
develop a practice of communi-
cation theory and provide the 
resources necessary to achieve 
those goals. 

We have established a Com-
munication Student Resource 
Center at M CC 103 where we are 
building a library of communi-
cation texts, a video resource 
center, producing a publication 
for communication students, 
distributins course and depart-
mental literature and providing 
a place for groups like "Women 
in Communication" to meet.

IW I THE 
PEACE CORPS 

A recent study, presented to the American Psychological Association, revealed 
some interesting facts about former Peace Corps Volunteers. For example: 

• Over a five-year period, college faculty with Peace Corps experience averaged 
almost double the salary gains of Fulbright scholars. 

• 250 Congressional aides and 10 percent of all Foreign Service officers are Retumed 
Peace Corps Volunteers. 

• From 1980 to 1985, former Peace Corps Volunteers outperformed national average 
salary gains for health service workers by 40.10/0, educators by 13.50/0, and public sector 
employees by 10.60/0. 

PEACE CORPS SERVICE IS A WAY TO HELP YOURSELF BY HELPING OTHERS. 
Working at a professional level that ordinarily might take years of' apprenticeship back 
home, volunteers find the career growth they're looking for and enjoy a unique experi-
ence in the developing world. International firms and govemment agencies value the 
skills and knowledge mastered during Peace Corps service. 

THERE ARE MORE OPENINGS THAN EVER in today's Peace Corps -- not just for 
farmers or technical specialists, but for skilled "generaliSts" and Liberal Arts graduates 
as well. To learn more about overseas opportunities with Peace Corps, contact your

Jackson calls for better Mexico-U.S. relations 
Continued from pa.e 1 
together as brothers and sisten, 
and not die apart as fools." 

Jackson also commented on 
the money given to the Contras 
in Nicaragua: "I would have spent 
that same money chasing poverty 
and ignorance." 

Rev. Jackson combined the 
border issue with his own anti-
drug message that has been a 

point of his campaign. "Stop 
drugs from comin, into the 
country, our bodies, and our 
minds. Stop jobs from going 
out- invest in people." 

He reminded the enthusiastic 
crowd of the inscription on the 
Statue of Liberty that reads : 
"Give me your tired, your hungry, 
your huddled massed yearning 
to breathe free." He repeated the 

CLA 

inscription several times, his voice 
breaking and cracking with 
emotion. "It didn't say give me 
your English-speaking only. If it 
had said give me your English 
only, we would hardly have 
enough people to fill Rhode 
Island ... 

Jackson made more specific 
references to San Diego while 
continuing to share the core issues 

of his campaign of re-investing 
in the individual. "It makes more-
sense to invest in prenatal care 
and day care in the beginning, 
rather than jail care and welfare 
later on." 

"One year at San Diego High 
School costs $3,000, but one 
year at San DieJlo County Jail 
costs $20,000," he added.

AARON, the artistic comJ:2uter 

Computer-generated art 
may be future fad 

By JULIE HEIMLER 
c".,dUut Tiller. 

I magine it is the year 2000 and 
you are standing in the Louvre 
Museum in France, surrounded 
by beautiful paintings. Amaz-
ingly, what appears to be art 
made by human hands is in 
reality art not only created, but 
actually conceived by a compu-
ter. This seemingly unlikely sce-
nario may not be too far off in 
the future. In fact, the beginnings 
of this futuristic vision have their 
origins right here at UCSD's 
visual arts department. 

instructed the computer how to 
draw objects, rather he has 
taught the computer knowledge 

re~arding appearances. 
fhe result ofthis, Cohen says, 

is that the drawings are "pro-
duced by the computer, not with 
the computer." The computer 
has been programmed to under-
stand parts of the human ana-
tomy (and their legal range of 
movement), and how the parts 
interact in relation to each other, 
Cohen said. Cohen's computer, 
AARON, is also aware of the 
physical behavior of humans, 
and considers gestures and be-
haviors of the body before de-
signing the figure. All Cohen has 

AARON has been programmed to under-
stand parts of the human anatomy. It con-
siders gestures and behaviors of the body 
before desigining the figure. 

Harold Cohen, a visual arts 
professor at UCSD, is at the 
forefront of this innovative new 
art form. Cohen has created a 
program for his Micro-VAX 
computer that enables it to 
produce original drawings from 
its own knowledge. 

The program, which has taken 
20 years to reach its present 
state, is capable of drawing black 
and white linear drawings of 
human beings, plants,and rocks. 
According to Cohen he has not 

Rubes® 

to do is command the computer 
to "GO" and the creation of the 
artwork is started. 

The process of creating a 
drawing can take anywhere from 
45 minutes to two hours, de-
pending on the lensth of time it 
takes the computer to make the 
drawing in its imagination, and 
the length of time it takes the 
drawing machine to actually 
draw the piece. 

Every aspect ofthe drawing is 
"thought out" by the computer 

By Leigh Rubin

"Well how about that! You 're absolutely correct. 
Field mice don 't have trunks! " 

itself - the subject, the size, and 
the composition of the drawing. 
The size of the drawing is large, 
with an approximate width of 
20-30 inches, and length of 30-50 
inches. 

Although AARON is the only 
computer of its kind in the world. 
there are AARON clones on 

public display at ·the Computer 
Museum in Boston, the IBM 
Gallery in New York, and one to 
open shortly at the Loa A,lgeles 
Museum of Science and Indus-
try. Among the three systems. 
approximately 15-20 drawings 
are being created each day. 
Cohen estimates that during the 
last five years 3,000 drawings 
were sold to people all over the 
world . 

Although the paintings created 
by Cohen's computer, AARON, 
have not yet been displayed at 
the Louvre, exhibitions of the 
computer and its amazing skills 
have been held at other museums 
world-wide. In fact , during his 
seven-week show at the Tate 
Gallery in London, Cohen sold 
almost 1,000 drawings.

Features Errata 
The article entitled Working to Improve SDPD's Public 

Relations (Guardian. 5/16) implied that the cases of Sagon 
Penn and Cara Knott tarnished the reputation of the San 
Diego Police Department. In actuality, Cara Knott's murder 
involved, specifically, the California Highway Patrol but has 
had a negative impact on the image of law enforcement 
agencies in general. Additionally, both Sagon and Cara were 
misspelled due to a production error. 

The Guardian regrets these erron. 

Harold Cohen, a highly re-
garded British nonrepresenta-
tional painter, first came to 
UCSD as a visiting professor in 
1968 and became interested in 
computer technology. Four years 
later this curiosity took him to 
Stanford University'S Artificial 
Intelligence·Laboratory where he 
was a visiting scholar for two 
years. It was from this experience 
that Cohen was able to acquire 
enough computer knowledge to 
start work on the program for 
AARON. Although Cohen says ,,--------------- -------
he does not like the drawings to r-r ---------------------
be called "computer art," he has You dOD't have to clip into 
yet to find a permanent name for . • 
them. 

When asked about future ad- your coUe"e fund to ..... ou 
vances for AARON's capabili- • av I 
ties, Cohen replied that he hopes 
to create the next generation of "reat froun yo"urL 
computers with a three-dimen-. •

Women's H 20 polo 
finishes third 
By PHIL GRUEN 
Stfl/l Writer 

The great UCSD spring sports 
machine keeps rolling along. Last 
weekend, the women's waterpolo 
team placed third in a field of 
nine at the US Women's Col-
legiate National Championships 
in Annapolis, MD to earn the 
no. 3 ranking in the country as 
the season came to a conclusion. 
The Tritons finished the year 
with a 20-5 record. 

UCSD appeared as if it was 
headed for the championship of 
the tournament after they dom-
inated Stanford, Slippery Rock 
and Cal Poly by scores of 10-3, 
10-5, 10-1, respectively. U nfor-
tunately, they had not yet faced 
the teams that would finish no. I 
and 2 in the tournament, UC 
Davis and UC Santa Barbara. 

The game against Davis fea-
tured what Triton coach Denny 
Harper considered "the greatest 
fourth quarter ever" by his team. 
Down 4-1 at the half, Harper's 
team stormed back, only to 

eventually fall to Davis by a tight 
6-4 score. 

UCSD still had a shot at the 
no . 2 ranking but lost to UCSB 
in a down-to-the-wire contest, 8-
7. In this game, the Tritons 
battled back from a 5-1 halftime 
deficit to take a 7-6 lead only to 
fa118-7 when UCSB scored with 
18 seconds left. 

The Tritons then drowned 
Bucknell University 15-3 on 
Saturday in a consolation game 
to earn the third place ranking, 
three spots better than last year's 
sixth place finish at the national 
tournament in Irvine. UCSD won 
the tournament in 1986 when 
Harvard University played host. 

This year's order of finish is as 
follows : UCD, UCSB, UCSD, 
Slippery Rock, Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo, Bucknell, Stanford, 
Brown and UC Irvine. Triton 
Karen Crawford was named first 
team All-American while 
Amanda Palmquist, Jefi Paulsen 
and Lillian Lathrop were named 
as honorable mention All-Ameri-
cans. 

Tritons finish 8th 
By JONATHAN SCHRETER 
sports Editor 

Close, but no cigar . . . literally , 
for the UCSD men's tennis team 
as they lost to Whitman College 
5-4 to finish last at this year's 
NCAA National Tennis Tourna-
ment. 

"The ability level of all the 
teams is about the same. You 
gotta have the breaks in order to 
win the key points. We didn't get 
the breaks," said UCSD head 
coach John Hammermeister. 

The Tritons began their 0-3 
run with a 5 .... 1011 to Swarthmore 
College in the first round. The 
loss put them in the 100iq bracket 
where the best they could finish 
became fifth place. Hunter 
Gallaway, the Tritons no. I 
player was the only one to 
decisively defeat his opponent, 
Andy Mover (ranked no. 2 in the 
individual tournament) 6-1 , 6-1. 

The following day, the Tritons 

faced hosts Emory University 
and lost handily, 2-7. 

"Emory is all clay:-court play-
ers. And these courts were as 
slow as clay. Emory is just a 
bunch of little retrievers who 
play like a backboard . Our 
players are used to much faster 
courts and were easily frustrated," 
Hammermeister said. 

Emory not only beat UCSD 
but also upset Claremont-Mudd, 
one of the top ranked schools at 
the tournament. Earlier this year, 
"Claremont had buried them on 
normal courts," according to 
Hammermeister. 

The doubles teams of Gallaway 
and Sig Huber (the no. 2 Triton) 
and Francois Monnar and Jim 
Elliot were the only victories in 
the match, defeating their oppo-
nents 6-4, 6-4 and 6-3, 6-4, 
respectively. 

Having lost two matches al-
ready, the Tritons were playing 
WhItman for seventh place. The 

match took nine hours and thirty 
minutes because of poor location 
planning. 
, Because of rain, the tourna-

ment was moved indoors wbere 
only three courts were available 
for the dual matcb and club 
members. 

The length of time wasn't the 
only problem. Being indoors was 
a new experience for the majority 
of tbe Triton players, whereas 
the Whit~n team (from Wasb-
ington) all practiced under a roof. 

DespIte the problems, UCSD 
still managed a close .match, 
winning four of the six singles 
matches: Gallaway heat Eugene 
Kim, 6-4, 7-5; Monnar beat 
Roberto Karcomo 7-5, 6-2; Kyle 
Knapp defeated Chris Roe 3-6, 
6-4, 7-6; Elliot defeated Jeff 
Northam 6-3, 6-4. 

All the Tritons needed was 
one win in the doubles matches 
to take seventh place. It never 
came· 

Well, it almost did. French 
and Park, the number three 
doubles team, took their oppo-
nents Karcomo and Mark 
Donnally three sets, losing tbe 
third set in a 9-7 tiebreaker, 6-4, 
3-6, 7-6. 

Although the season is finished 
for tbe most of the team, Huber 
and Gallaway will continue in 
tbe individual tournament botb 
in singles and as a doubles team 
(they're ranked seventh in doub-
les). 

Golf 13th after 
first round 

By J. SCHRETER 
SporU Edit. 

"We've been fiahting the 
weather and the .olf cOUnt," 
said UCSD men's golf coach 
Mike Wydra on the team', 
13tb place ranking after the 
fint round of the NCAA 
National Golf tournament. 

"Wben it's rainin, we play 
well. wben it's not. we don't," 
Wydra said. 

After t~ fint 18 boles, the 
combined team score was 318, 
22 strokes off the four-time 
defending champion and cur-
rent leader Cal State Univer-
sity. Stanislaus (296). 

Joost Steenkamer and 
Sharm Newbold are tied and 
lead the Tritons witb a score 
of 76. Both playen have the 
possibility of qualifyin. for 
All-American statUI if their 
scores remain low. 

"Sharm didn't let a chance 
to finish his practice round on 
the 18th hole because of the 
rain," Wydra said. What he 
tbought would be a good 
round turned into a double 

bo,ty. Had Newbold paned 
tbe hole. be would have 
·finilhed tied for third with a 
73. 

Other Triton participants 
are Fritz Rever (82). Mike 
Reinhardt (84), and Brad 
Shupe (85). 

Followinl CSU Stani.laUI 
in tbe team competition is Cal 
State University, San Berna-
dino (302), AIlCJheny (304), 
and. UNC-Greensboro. and 
Methodist University (tied at 
308). 

Glenn Andrade of Stani-
slaus and Dave Gutierrez of 
CSUSB lead the individual 
competition with a score of 
72. Sam Wiley of AUelheny 
shot a 73 and both John Groth 
of Stanislaus and Frank 
ACOIta of CSUSB shot sevcn-
ty-fours. 

Because of the rain, the 
tournament has been .hort-
ened to 54 boles. Tee off 
tomorrow will be at II: IS. 
Now that the weather bas 
cleared up, tbe Tritons are 
boping their sbots act a little 
cleaner as well.

Intrlllfturlll So/tblll' Not~1 
PLAYOFfS are fast approaching as we 
near June. Softball playoffs will start June 
5th and end the weekend before finals. To 
qualify for the playoffs you must finish in 
the top half of your league, or in other 
words, the top four (4) teams in each 
league make the playoffs. Remember, in 
the current Coed A leagues we are split -
ting the leagues up into two divisions for 
the playoffs. In the Coed A leagues the top 
two teams in each league will go into their 
own playoff called the Coed A playoffs. All 
playoffs will be single elimination except 
Men's AAA which will be double elimina-
tion. Playoff brackets will be posted by the 
Intramural Office on June 1 sl. 

'" 
IAlNOUT ~ from the beginning of 
the season have been rescheduled. If you 
have not been contacted by the Intramu-
ral Office about your game give Scott 
Berndes a call at 534-4037 and find out 
when your make-up games will be played. 

Yes, we know Muir Field is a mine field. 
It's amazing that a year ago today Muir 
field had been closed for six months and 
was in beautiful condition. It just goes to 
show you how much use that field gets 
due to the lights. What are we dOing about 
it? The Grounds Department has prom-
ised to do a minor quick fix. It won 't be 
Chavez Ravine but hopefully it will be bet-
ter. In August Muir Field is scheduled to 
close again for two months of major 
renovation. 

'" 
For those who haven't driven by the 

new North Center Recreation area lately 
you won't recognize it now. The fields that 
the Chargers will be using are almost 
ready to play on. The facil ity that the team 
is building for the university is almost 
completed. It stili looks a mess and IS 
months from completion, but you can get 
an idea of how large the facility will be. 
Now if we only had a new Recreation 
building to accomodate the overflow of 
people wanting to use our indoor facilities. 
At that lime our recreation complex would 
be complete. 

~ 
Our women's basketball players are not 

one-dimensional athletes. They have a 
women's softball team that is awesome. 
They have outscored their last two oppo-
nents by the incredible margin of 86-1 . 
Hard to believe! 

~ 

For those of you st icking around for the 
summer, Intramurals doesn't stop when 
the school year is over. No sir! We have 
lots of intramural softball to be played in 
the summer. We start at the beginning of 
July and go to the end of August. We also 
have Floor Hockey and Indoor Coed Six-
person Volleybal l. Come on out and join 
us.

Sun God SOIUI on t"~ Court 
The most exciting play in the sport of 

basketball is the slam dunk. Many in the 
NBA have refined the art of dunking over 
the years. "Jumping" Johnny Greene and 
Connie Hawkins were the first flamboyant 
dunkers. Wilt was the original power dunk-
er. In the 70's Dr. J elevated the art to 
another level. His launching pad was the 
free throw line, and when he took off even 
Micheal Cooper was getting out of the 
way. When Doc joined the Sixers they had 
to keep a running tally called the Dunk-O-
Meter. The manchild Darryl DaWkins be-
gan labeling all his aerial acrobatics. Then 
he began ripping rims off backboards. 
Just when everyone thought they had 
seen it all in the world of jamming, along 
came Larry Nance, Dominique Wilkins, 
Spud Webb and the new king. Michael 
Jordan defies physics in his assault on the 
basket. The next generation of jam artists 
will be hard pressed to top the current 
gravity defying slammers. 

This past weekend at the Sun God Out-
door Basketball Tournament UCSD's fin-
est backboard breakers had their chance 
to swoop to the hoop. Just watching 
warm-ups it was easy to tell that everyone 
was getting up just a little bit higher. The 
air must have been a little thin on Saturday 
'cause the Dunk-O-Meter was off the 
board as the monster slams rattled the 
rims all afternoon. 

The pre-tournament favorite Nor Cal 
Connection set the tone for slamming and 
jamming early. Louie Matz and Andy Wag-
staff sprung loose on a 2 on 1 break. Matz 
tossed it up near the hoop and the trailing 
Wagstaff took the elevator to the top floor, 
grabbed and slammed with authority. Kevin 
Stewart was shakin' and bakin' on the 
baseline all day, bringing down the house 
with dunk after dunk, but his Cutting Edge 
squad came up a couple bucs short and 
bowed out in the semi-finals. Gorden 
McNeil stuffed everything in Sight inClud-
ing one defender who tried to slow him 
down, but his Inside & Out club was elimi-
nated early. Kirk Kramer, Brian Hutchens, 
Fred Davis, Nick Capauno, Thor Decker, 
Marvin Thompson and Chris Shen all pro-
vided aerial displays never seen before 
here at UCSD. 

The bragging rights for best dunker on 
campus was only part of the festivities. 
There was also a tournament title to be 
won. After along day of preliminary games 
and playoff action there were two teams 
left to compete for the title, the defending 
champs The Herd and the high flying Nor 
Cal Connection. Before the game Herd 
captain Greg Kamansky wondered about 
the ability of the Herd (legendary chokers) 
to repeat as champions. As the game 
began both teams were tenative, but the 
momentum swung toward Nor Cal when 
Greg Kund followed a missed shot with a 
high flying two-handed jam that brought 
onlookers to their feet. The Herd's inability 
to hit from the outside proved costly as 
Nor Cal crashed the boards and got the 
ball to Matz, who fed Wagstaff, Tim Rapp, 
Kund and Rick Batt. Kamansky and Co. 
couldn't keep up with Wagstaff's crew. 
The final tally was Nor Cal Connection 11 , 
Herd 7.

I first saw an advertisement 
for the movie "Willow" long 
ago, around the middle of 
January. It was a great ad, 
showing swords and sorcery, 
knights and maidens, and all 
the usual fantasy stuff. That 
was the first thing that piqued 
my interest, because I have 
always been a fan of the pure 
adventure movie. The second 
thing that really caught my 
attention was the announcer 
intoning, "From the creative 
minds that brought you "Star 
Wars"and "Cocoon . . . "mean-
ing George Lucas and Ron 
Howard. 

George Lucas is sort of 
like Steven Spielberg in my 
opinion, and he can do no 
wrong. I also enjoyed what 
Ron Howard did with "Co-
coon" and "Splash." I was 
ready to put down five and a 
half bucks for this movie. But 
then, as this tantalizing trailer 
ended, the announcer came 
back on; "Coming to a theater 
near you this May." 

I almost had a heart attack, 
but I swore to be patient, and 
eventually May arrived, and 
so did "Willow." I must say, 
it was worth the wait. 

The story is pretty much 
standard fare, paralleling a lot 
of the ideas in the original 
"Star Wars," but putting them 
in a fantasy setting. The pro-
phecy says that a child will be 
born that will bring about the 
demise of the evil Queen 
Bavmorda Uean Marsh, of 
PBS's "Upltain Downatain"). 

The Queen rounds up all 
the pregnant women in her 
kingdom, but when the child 
is born, it is smuggled away. 
The Queen sends her beauti-
ful warrior daughter Sorsha 

.' 

Goanne Whalley) after it, so 
its spirit can be exorcised, 
never to return to threaten her 
reign. The baby winds up in 
the land of the Nelwyn, peace-
fullittle people who are mainly 
farmers and miners. 

Willow Ufgood (Warwick 
Davis, first seen in the role of 
Wicket, the star Ewok from 
"Return of the Jedi") finds 
the baby, and it is decided that 
Willow must bring the baby 
back to big people, the Diaki-
nis. The expedition eventually 
meets Madmartigan, (Val 
Kilmer, who I am told, is not 
as good looking here as in his 
role as "Iceman" Kazansky in 
"Top Gun") a Diakini who 
has been left to die in a "crow's 

cage" for his crimes. 
He swears that he will care 

for the baby if Willow frees 
him. He does, and regretfully 
leaves the baby in Madmarti-
gan's hands. Willow heads 
home glad to be free of the 
baby. 

The fates have other things 
in mind, unfortunately for 
Willow. Together with Mad-
martigan and two tiny Brow-
nies, our unlikely hero is given 
a quest to bring the baby to a 
secret castle where it will be 
safe from the clutches of Sor-
sha and Queen Bvmorda. 

Along the way, Madmarti-
gan falls in love with Sorsha 
and persuades her to betray 
her mother and join them. 

The Arts and Entertainment Section

Volume 18 May 19, 1988 Number 7 

After some fabulous battles, 
(one with a terrific two-
headed, fire-breathing dragon) 
good triumphs over evil (I 
don't think that gives away the 
ending). 

There have been so many 
bad fantasy movies that many 
people will be hesitant to go 
and see this one. "Willow" 
has the same quality that sets 
the "Star Wars" trilogy above 
all the other space movies, a 
great and never-ending atten-
tion to detail. Each scene is a 
feast for the eyes and imagina-
tion. 

This is where George 
Lucas' genius shines through. 

He wrote the original story 
and was the executive produ-

eer. Ron Howard does an apt 
job, but it is hard to see his 
influences. This movie is pure 
Lucas. 

"Willow" has everything 
that anyone could ever desire 
in a movie. Adventure, ro-
mance, comedy, and drama 
are all included. Seeing this 
movie is like being thrust into 
another reality for two hours. 
Jbat is how comR,letely Lucas 
and Howard have succeeded. 

This is the best movie of 
1988 (so far) and everyone 
should see it. The ad's line is 
correct. Forget all you know, 
or all you think you know, 
about all other previous fan-
tasy movies and go see "Wil-
low." It is a cut above the rest. 

Santana, su mejor gTUPO en mucho tiempo 
Lyrical ideas were infrequent and 

in Spanish, hits were few land far 
between and the headliner was maybe 
the third belt soloist in the band, 
maybe fourth. 

There was also a dippy speech 
about crossing the border from 
Tijuana to the land that has given 
Carlos Santana the chance to play his 
Latin-blues-rock hybrid, and make 
lots of money doing it. 

It was still a great show Friday 
night at SDSU's Open Air Amphi-
theater, the kind of eclectic, musi-
cianly evening that has come to char-
acterize the Northern California 
music scene. 

Santana himself was not com-
pletely outclassed; you can make a 
case that he's the best blues guitarist 

by jeff berelford .. howe 
opinion editor 

anywhere. His playing on some of 
the bluesier "Salvador" tunes is the 
most tasteful stuff he does. 

Santana has pared down his band 
for a tour built around his new 
album, "Blues for Salvador;" his 
sextet in his best band in years. 
They're playing new, instrumental 
tunes almost exclusively, eschewing 
classics like "Black Magic Woman" 
and "Oye Como Va." 

It's a measure of the band's inten-
sity that in an evening ofloose arrange-
ments and traded solos, Santana fin-
ished a contender but out of the 
money. 

Chester Thompson played beauti-
fully-drawn, soulful keyboards and 
Aphonso Johnson demonstrated 
several times why he is one of the 

two or three best rock bassists on the 
planet. 

And, the highlight of the show was 
a vibes solo during the first encore by 
Chepito Areas, usually on the tim-
,bales. 

One note: Playing at a Cinco de 
Mayo festival at Berkeley's Greek 
Theater, Santana talked about El 
Salvador and the inspiration behind 
his album; here in San Diego, the 
border crossing speech was all he 
delivered. 

Whether he omitted the reference 
because San Diego reminds him of 
the old days or from fear of alienat-
ing conservative SDSU students, this 
ostrich-like city could have used the 
reminder of the struggle that so con-
sistently informs Santana's music 
and projects.

~ tion with Bauhaus, Murphy 

Amid the dyed hair and 
the remorseful clothing that 
most of the young audience 
was wearing Sunday night at 
San Diego's North Park Thea-
tre, I couldn't help but feel 
out of place. The near capacity 
crowd had turned out to see 
England's post,punk leading 
man, Peter Murphy - some' 
one who until only a week 
ago I knew very little about. 

Braced with knowledge 
gained from a phone interview 
with ¥urphy earlier in the 
singer ot Gothic supergroup 
tacular performance, I awa-
ited his appearance anxiously. 

From his hotel room in San 
Francisco, the former lead 
singer of Gothic supergroup 
Bauhaus, Peter Murphy 
spolce freely about his current 
and past associations. In re, 
gard to his constant affilia-

(-

spoke affectionately, .. It 
doesn't really bother me. 1 
actually see it as a very natural 
thinM ti:ll!t hapPens. 

" If you've been a part of a 
band, and a very strong part of 
that band, and that is what 
you are most Icnown by in that 
point in time, then 1 can. 
understand why commercial 
people play on that to get 
attention. I am pretty confi, 
dent that it will disappear when 
it needs to." 

Trying to sidestep the sub-
ject of Bauhaus I kept the 
questions geared toward Mur-
phy's latest album, "Love 
Hysteria," and his tour sup' 
porting it. In regard to his use 
of numerous producers on his 
solo projects, including Simon 
Rogers on" Love Hysteria," 
Murphy explained, "When I 
was in Bauhaus, I'd have other 
people to bounce off of. [Being

on my own] I really wanted 
someone there to bounce off 
of, so I called those people 
producers. With Simon Rog, 
ers, however, he actually did 
produce the album, but by no 
means was it a situation that 
he took the whole thing over 
and made it sound exactly as 
he liked; it was a real collabora, 
tion." 

Citing his live performan-
ces as a vital and energetic part 
ofhisartistry, Murphy spoke 

c

passionately about some of 
his favorite U.S. tour stops. 
"New York and the big spots 
give off quite a buzz because 
you get that whole concentra' 
tion similar to London and 
Paris and all those music capi-
tals. But I really like playing 
cities like Cincinnati and Pitts-
burgh which are really un-
known areas and there is probll-
bly a concentration of only 
three to five hundred people 
who know of me in that whole 
city. 

" I also love playing to peo-
ple who haven't experienced 
me or what I've done. For in' 
stance, we played Pittsburgh 
and the place was fifteen 
hundred capacity and we got 
five hundred in. I performed 
as much as I would anywhere 
in that situation, and the 
audience gave off the reaction 
as though they'd experienced 
something special. It was really 
a wonderful gig, the fans made 
more noise than most. II 

Before ending the conversa-
tion Murphy promised that 
this year's tour would be bet'

ter than many in the past. 
"There is much more of an 
organic band entity on stage, 
it's really more powerful this 
time around." 

Murphy proved true to 
his word as he displayed an 
intensive amount of energy 
during the ninety minute set. 
Jumping around constantly 
only to stop suddenly to strike 
theatrical poses similar to 
those of David Bowie and Peter 
Gabriel, Murphy recited rna, 
terial primarily from his new 
album. 

Proving to give more of a 
self-choreographed perfor, 
mance than a concert, Murphy 
added the welcome element of 
a vivacious energy rarely 
matched by other music acts. 

In a time when bands seem 
less and less interested in 
showmanship as opposed to 
lifeless performances, Mur, 
phy is a welcome change. 

Having mastered this tech-
nique, Murphy utilizes it in a 
fashion that places him in a 
category with a very select 
few.

The six rectangular com' 

postitions of the "Thomas" 
exhibit are covered with cloth 
and acrylic. They are pre' 

Guardian 
dominantly white but sharp 
vivid lines and blocks of color 
cut through them. Each 
paintin& represents and is 
titled from the p rimary 

colors "Red," "Blue." 
"Green," "Yellow," and ter, 
tiary color, "Blue,Green." 

Curt Thomas paintings are 
clean and perfect. But the 
lines offer no softness, except 
for the nuances of emotion 
in the rich color of each 
work. The works, without 
borders to hold in the white' 

, ness of compositions, seem 
to bleed onto the white wall, 
creating an optical illusion of 
a heat wave of whiteness. 
The show runs until May 
20. The Annex Gallery hours 
are from 1,5 p.m. daily.
