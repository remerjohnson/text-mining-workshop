Plans for the debut of Triton 
Outfitters — an on-campus store 
selling Sun God and Greek mer-
chandise — have been pushed 
back again to early Spring Quarter. 

     The idea for 
Triton Outfitters 
was first con-
ceived in 2009 
as the senator 
project of then-
Campus-Wide 
Senator Tobias 
Haglund. 

Since A.S. 
Council allo-
cated $204,000 
in start-up costs 
to the store at 
its last meet-
ing in Spring 
Quarter 2010, 
the store falls  
under the juris-

diction of Vice President of Finance 
and Resources Andrew Ang 
and Associate Vice President of 
Enterprise Operations Brian McEuen. 
     According to McEuen, he and 
Ang expected to have the necessary 
financial details finalized by the end 
of summer, but it will now take all 
of Fall Quarter and Winter Quarter 
to reach completion due to planning 
difficulties like receiving approval 
from the university.

McEuen said he expects the 
store to open in March or April. He 
and Ang will present the long-term 
plan and the financial obligations 
of Triton Outfitters to council at the 
end of the quarter.

UCSD Health and the depart-
ment of radiation oncology have 
announced plans to build a proton 
therapy center for cancer treatment 
and research. 

The center — built in collabora-
tion with Proton Health Partners, 
LLC —  will be located near the 
UCSD Moores Cancer Center, by 
Thornton Hospital. UCSD is cur-
rently negotiating a land lease with 
the UC Board of Regents for a site 
in the UCSD Science Research Park.  

The project is the brainchild 
of Radiation Department Chair 
Arno Mundt and Chief of UCSD’s 
Pediatric Oncology Service Kevin 
Murphy.

It was proposed by a workgroup 
launched in 2007 by the dean of the 
medical school to determine the 
feasibility of the project.

Proton therapy is an extremely 
aggressive cancer treatment avail-
able at only at a handful of centers 
worldwide. It was first used experi-
mentally in the 1950s and works 
by delivering high doses of tar-
geted radiation to dangerous tumor 
cells while leaving the surrounding 
healthy tissue untouched. 

Proton therapy is often used for 
treating cancers near critical organs 
— such as eyes, brain, lungs, spine, 
breast and prostate — due to its 
high level of precision. It is also 
used for treating children whose 
bodies are less capable of with-
standing radiation damage. 

“Proton therapy is the most cut-
ting edge form of radiation therapy 
today,” Mundt said. “[It] is a critical 
tool for the future of fighting cancer 
… and is one of the necessary tools 
a comprehensive medical center 
[such as UCSD] should have in its 
arsenal to combat cancer.” 

Proton Health Partners, a pri-
vate company in San Diego, will be 
financing the estimated $205 mil-
lion project. The center will even-
tually be staffed by UCSD medical 
specialists and will serve as both a 
treatment and research center.

“By combining UCSD’s growing 
department of radiation oncology 
with Proton Health Partners’ nearly 
20 years of proton treatment experi-
ment, we are building one of the 
strongest proton treatment teams 
in the nation,” Mundt said. “[After 
interviewing] many groups which 
were interested in developing pro-
ton centers, we liked Proton Health 
Partners because it looked at this 
opportunity primarily for the ben-
efit of cancer patients and not just 
as a business opportunity.”

The estranged husband of a 
woman whose body was found in a 
burning vehicle was arrested on sus-
picion of murder on Friday, Nov. 5.

Julio Angel Garcia-Puente, 50, 
was located in the Otay neigh-
borhood of Tijuana by the Baja 
California Police Department. 
They informed the San Diego 
Police Department that Garcia-
Puente voluntarily returned to the 
United States.  

San Diego investigators met 
Garcia-Puente at the San Ysidro 

port of entry on Saturday, Nov. 6 at 
12:05 a.m. They booked him into 
the San Diego County Jail on the 
suspicion of murder; he is being 
held without bail. 

The registered vehicle owner, 
whose car was found in the parking 
lot on Oct. 29 next to the UCSD 
baseball field, was identified as a 
38-year-old Carlsbad resident. 
The name of the registered vehicle 
owner has not yet been released. 
The identity of the body is pending 
DNA comparison.

UCSD has spent the last 50 years cultivating its reputation as an institution of higher learning, 
earning the title of America’s seventh-
best public university from U.S. News and 
World Report for 2010. Our school’s style 
of education, however, rests somewhere 
between the public and the private spheres, 
with enough large-scale research projects 
to distance faculty from students, but none 
of the name recognition or prestige of an 
Ivy. By treading the middle path, UCSD 
offers neither the intimacy of a smaller, 
lesser-known college nor the study money 
of a top 10 university, but some disjointed 
combination of the two.

According to the book “Higher 
Education?” by Andrew Hacker and 
Claudia Dreifus — professor emeritus for 
Queens College in New York and New 
York Times writer, respectively — paying 
hundred of thousands of dollars for a pres-
tigious school won’t necessarily get you 
the education from the big-name faculty 
members you signed on for. Staff at a lesser-
known university, on the other hand, aren’t 
distracted by research, athletic programs 
and maintaining a high profile, allowing 
them to focus their attention on the class-
room.

GradÊStudentÊDesignsÊMoney-SavingÊCoralÊReef ÊFishÊTraps
SCIENCEÊANDÊTECHNOLOGY

By Kirsten Mauro
Staff Writer

An environmental science grad 
student at the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography has designed a new fish 
trap that reduces the number of low-
value fish being caught. 

“Coral reef fishing constitutes the 
majority of fishermen’s incomes, yet 
these traps reduce the waste associated 
with fishing, and without effecting their 
revenue,” creator Ayana Johnson said. 
“It’s a win-win situation.”

To do this, Johnson surveyed reef 
traps across the Caribbean island of 
Curacao. According to Johnson, up to 
80 percent of smaller fish irrelevant to 
commercial fishermen could be saved 
by her proposed alteration. These 
juvenile and smaller species of fish are 
undesirable for food and are disposed 
of when found in fishing traps.  

Johnson studied these traps for 
approximately four months in 2008 
in Curacao, a country off the coast of 
Venezuela. The government there had 
proposed regulation that required local 

fishermen to use escape gaps (exit slots 
that allow smaller fish to escape) in 
their traps. This proposal was based 
on a law from neighboring Bermuda. 
But neither Curacao nor Bermuda had 
conducted research on how this might 
affect the fish population. 

Johnson constructed replicas with 
the suggested dimensions — 20-by-2.5 
centimeters, as proposed by Curacao’s 
regulation. A local welder created these 
escape gaps out of cheap steel rebar, 
which could be added to the mesh traps 
fishermen currently use. 

Johnson placed eight traps 
at three different locations on 
the island to soak for three days.  
Some traps had exit slots and others did 
not, in order to analyze the variety of 
species caught. 

“It is important to test the traps in 
multiple locations to make sure that 
the results are generalizable and not 
specific to one part of the reef,” she said. 
“I chose the locations after consulting 
with Curacao’s fishery manger to 
find places where trap fishing has 
traditionally occurred, and that also 

represent  different types of coral reef 
habitat.”

The fish caught were then weighed 
and multiplied at pound per value to 
calculate the revenue that would be 
lost. Johnson found that fishermen 
using her new traps would be catching 
half the amount of fish, with no relative 
change in their profit.

According to the Coral Reef 
Alliance, 36 percent of the world’s reefs 
are exploited by overfishing, and in 
some areas this has led to the extinction 
of highly valued species. Johnson said 
she does not condone reef fishing, but 
sees her research as a way of improving 
this process.

“About 500 million people in 
developing countries around the 
world depend on coral reefs for their 
nutrition and livelihoods, and trap 
fishing accounts for the majority of reef 
fish caught in many locations,” she said. 
“That’s what makes it so important to 
figure out a way to conduct trap fishing 
in a more sustainable manner.” 

Johnson would like to see her 
improved fish traps enforced by new 

laws from the Curacao government. 
She is working alongside fisheries and 
other interested researchers to get her 
traps implemented. 

“I have provided my results to 
the fishery management department 
and hope that this data will help to 
encourage the politicians there to pass 
the proposed law that would require 
the gaps to be used,” she said.

Quarter, that’s okay because the 
campus is pretty dead in the winter,” 
McEuen said. “The merchandise we 
plan to offer in spring, with Sun 
God apparel, will draw in a larger 
crowd.”

According to McEuen, the 
council is working with Trio 
Display, a retail store design-
er, to design the interior layout. 
     Though a contract with University 
Centers hasn’t been discussed yet, 
one option is for rent to be set at $2 
per square foot for the 634-square-
foot space — which comes to a total 
of $1,268 per month. This will be 
finalized by February 2011.

“As of now, we’re still working 
a long-term [financial] strategy for 
the store,” Ang said. “All the start 
up-costs have already been allo-
cated by A.S. in the prior term. We 
don’t want to overspend the budget, 
but we haven’t worked out how long 
it will take to break even in profit.”

The $204,000 is expected to 
encompass all start-up, construc-
tion, merchandise and employee 
costs. 

The council is also still waiting 
for approval from the UCSD Retail 
and Commercial Services Advisory 
Committee Charge — responsible 
for advising long-term planning for 
on-campus retail activity — that 
reports to the Vice Chancellor’s 
Business Affairs, Resource 
Management & Planning.

“We’ve gotten approval from 
the Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Office, so the next thing to 
do is await the approval from the 
Campus Charge Committee, which 

could take about five months,” 
McEuen said. “We’re confident 
that we’ll get the full approval.” 
   The committee is comprised 
of members from Academic 
Senate, Business Affairs, Resource 
Management & Planning, Student 
Affairs, two undergraduate stu-
dents, one graduate student and the 
three directors from the University 
Bookstore, Housing and Dining 
Services and University Centers. 
The directors are John Turk, Mark 
Cunningham and Paul Terzino, 
respectively.

According to McEuen, Triton 
Outfitters will be located in Price 
Center on the West Wing balco-
ny, two doors down from Kaplan 
Testing Centers.

“The mark-up on merchandise 
will be the same for all organi-
zations, regardless of size or the 
number of items they want to sell,” 
McEuen said. “We haven’t worked 
out a set percentage mark-up yet 
but retailers typically charge a 20- 
to-40-percent overhead.”

The store plans to have a regular 
set of merchandise — such as items 
celebrating the 50th anniversary of 
UCSD, A.S. apparel — along with 
seasonal and event-related mer-
chandise for the Sun God festival 
and registered student org merchan-
dise, such as T-shirts, sweatshirts 
and lanyards. Triton Outfitters has 
not yet contacted organizations 
interested in partnering.

“I don’t think small organiza-
tions like ours [30 members] can 
guess how we can use the space to 
our benefit until they come out with 
some guidelines,” Kristin Muench, 

of the registered organization Out 
of Office Hours said. “It’s such a 
small space, and there will be so 
much competition from larger 
organizations to use it — Greeks, 
large departmental groups and the 
newly-defunded media organiza-
tions — that I don’t think most 
student organizations will benefit 
from its existence.”

Out of Office Hours recently 
registered as an organization in the 
2009-10 school year — but with the 
possibility of selling merchandise 
at the store — Muench does not 
think it will significantly increase 
the organization’s visibility. 

“Also, University Centers has 
struggled financially for some time 
now,” Muench said. “I expect the 
overhead for selling in the store will 
be pretty high. Student orgs had 
better find a dirt-cheap way of mak-
ing products priced, so that people 
will buy on a whim if they want to 
make any profit at all.”

A.S. Council has not contact-
ed all 580 registered on-campus 
organizations about the store or 
conducted surveys with the orgs, 
but they still remain hopeful about 
Triton Outfitters. 

“We think a lot of the Greeks 
and organizations would like to 
have their merchandise sold in the 
store to increase their visibility 
on campus,” McEuen said. “Triton 
Outfitters will be a good way to 
bring out student unity and expand 
the constituency of many organiza-
tions.”

UCSD’s new proton center was 
announced the same week that 
another company, Advance Particle 
Therapy, began pouring concrete 
for another proton therapy center in 
Mira Mesa. APT is partnering with 
Scripps Health.

“I’d be pleasantly surprised 
if the region could support two 
proton centers,” Lenard Artz, 
Executive Director of the National 
Association of Proton Therapy, said. 
The National Association of Proton 
Therapy is a Maryland-based non-
profit that promotes the treatment.

Both companies said they are 
not concerned about competition. 

“We believe there is room for 
two, maybe three players in San 
Diego [which] will draw patients 
from around the world,” Proton 
Health Partners CEO Neil Fox said. 

The UCSD center will focus on 
pediatric care in proton therapy. 
Fox said this could also help reduce 
any financing or competition prob-
lems and will be beneficial to the 
recent partnership between Rady 
Children’s Hospital and St. Jude 
Children’s Research Hospital in 
Memphis. 

Mundt has said that Loma Linda 
— the first American proton cen-
ter — has a research contract with 
NASA and he hopes to do similar 
collaborations in the future. 

 “Numerous research opportuni-
ties exist with NASA,” he said. “A 
proton center on the UCSD campus 
allows UCSD to be able to compete 
for these research dollars.”

Ground breaking for the cen-
ter is planned for 2011. The first 
patient will be admitted in 2014.

at Tiffany’s” kiss in the rain, “Say 
Anything’s” blaring boom box, or 
the passion of “The Notebook” leave 
me craving some Gosling, this magic 
often fails to translate into my unfabu-
lous life. So, to add a little whirlwind 
romance, I’ve decided to take matters 
into my own hands.

The secrets to an unforgettable 
relationship are the anticipation  — 
and even the drama. If Romeo and 
Juliet’s parents were as uninvolved as 
Jon and Kate Gosselin, the two would 
have dated for a few weeks until Juliet 
realized that Romeo was a total tool. 
But because they were forbidden to be 
together, it made them exponentially 
more attracted to each other. It sounds 
pretty hot to have a “forbidden” rela-
tionship, so why not pretend to have 
your own crazy romantic expedition?

This summer, I decided to have 
my own movie-moment after saying 
goodbye to a close guy-friend. After 
I left his house, I sat in my car and 
debated if I was really satisfied that 
the night ended with a high-five. With 
the “whatever happens, this will be 
a funny story someday” mentality, I 
shoved my keys in my jacket and went 
to knock on his door, complaining 
that I left my keys somewhere in his 
house. We proceeded to “look” for 
my keys, and when he reached into 
my jacket pocket and pulled out my 
keys, I blushed and told him I was 
“so embarrassed.” I played the damsel 
in distress, asked him what I would 
ever do without him and ended the 
evening with a perfect goodnight kiss. 
Talk about a night even Hollywood 
couldn’t write.

When a night doesn’t go your way, 
sometimes you have to manipulate it 
to become more passionate. I call it 
preconceived spontaneity — the act of 
giving the impression that a situation 
is wonderfully coincidental or sponta-
neous, when really it requires quality 
daydreaming during lecture and some 
skills from “Intro to Acting.”

Indulge in the cliché and rock pre-
conceived spontaneity in basic ways. 
Sometimes when my boyfriend invites 
me over, I’ll tell him that I’m busy 
just so I can drop in and surprise him 
later. It is a bit easier than popping out 
of a cake on his birthday, yet it has a 
similar effect.

Creating your own romantic 
moment should only be done when 
sober and using your best judge-
ment, because this strategy can easily 
transform from romantic to incredibly 
awkward. There is a fine line between 
creating a romance catalyst and being 
a total creep. For example: Walking 
around his block until you happen to 
bump into each other is called stalk-
ing, and if he catches on, you’ll prob-
ably look more psycho than cute. 

Next time a potential relationship 
needs bit of mouth-to-mouth, con-
sider reenacting a rom-com scene. We 
can’t sit around wishing Hugh Grant 
will spill orange juice on us. We must 
make it happen ourselves. Sometimes 
life requires a little imagination for a 
fairytale ending.

GQ featured Dianna Agron, Lea Michele and 
male co-star Cory Monteith in an erotic photo 
shoot. While Monteith’s role in the shoot was fairly 
innocuous and fully clothed, his co-stars should 
have thought of their teen fans before stripping  
down to crop tops and underwear while posing pro-
vocatively with lollipops and gym benches. 

Though the “Glee” stars are all well over 18, we 
can’t refute the fact that they were acting out sexual-
ized situations as the underage high school char-
acters they portray on the show. It is unacceptable 
that the cast of a show that centers on showing kids 
how to navigate tough high school problems like 
peer pressure and coming out would pose in such 
provocative shoots. 

“Glee” isn’t just for kids; the show deals frankly 
with sex and body-image issues (just this season, 
one character got breast implants). Some of the 
more mature themes in “Glee” mean that parents 
with young children should already be exercising 
caution. But we can’t ignore the fact that the cast is 
meant to be high school role models, and should 
present themselves accordingly. Every action they 
make has consequences for the hordes of teen 
“gleeks” that hang on their every word. The shoot 
dangerously reinforces the stereotype that while 
men need only pose for a camera to be lovable, 
women need to take off their clothes for attention.

“Glee’s” Racy GQ Cover

We freaked when Britney wore red pleather. We 
were horrified when we saw too much of Vanessa 
Hudgens and we completely lost it when footage 
of Miley Cyrus working a pole at the Teen Choice 
Awards hit the air. Now the cast of “Glee” has joined 
the scandalous masses.  This photo shoot allows the 
public to do just what they love best: Be outraged. 

Quite frankly, I’m over it.
Doing a sexy photo shoot as a young actress 

is not out of the norm — it’s about as common as 
getting braces in middle school. But for some rea-
son, people can’t help but call out young celebs for 
showing a little skin. Not only is it a normal part 
of pop culture, but these risqué shoots date back to 
the invention of the camera and thigh-high socks. 
Even Marilyn Monroe did a scandalous Playboy 
shoot when she was 23 — one year younger than Lea 
Michele and Dianna Agron. 

In today’s world, we see young stars like Lindsay 
Lohan and Taylor Momsen turn from sweet to trashy 
before they have a chance to blow out the 18 candles. 
The attention the adoring or reproachful public gives 
them only fuels content like “Glee’s” GQ. Without 
the controversy, GQ wouldn’t be the first hit to come 
up every time a young fan Googles “Glee.” Throwing 
a fit over young actresses posing in their undies is so 
cliche, that working up all that mental outrage seems 
like a new way to burn calories.

Panties and boobies and sex, oh my! Three stars 
of the hit TV show “Glee” posed half naked in a 
GQ photo spread, and according to the notoriously 
conservative Parents Television Council, the world’s 
coming to an end. The council charged that the spread 
“borders on pedophilia.”

Let’s define pedophilia, shall we? According to 
Dictionary.com, it’s “the condition of being sexually 
attracted to children.” 

All that’s shown in GQ are unoriginal pictures of 
three consenting and very well-paid adults. The two 
women, Dianna Agron and Lea Michele, are both 
24 years old, while Cory Monteith is 28. The Parents 
Television Council claimed to be concerned about the 
sexualization of young women, but where were they 
in April when the cover of Rolling Stone featured the 
“ass-ets” of both Agron and Michele? The girls rode a 
bicycle and roller skate in miniskirts, exposing plenty 
of skin as well as Michele’s underwear. Face it, “Glee’s” 
stars were selling us sex long before GQ came calling. 

Besides, if you really look, the shots aren’t all that 
sexy. Lea Michele, who plays Rachel Berry, manages to 
look either confused or like she got caught mid-hump 
in every shot.  And as long as we’re complaining about 
sex appeal, where’s the action for the ladies? Monteith 
stays fully clothed in every photo. As a society we 
should rise up and tell GQ that we won’t stand for this. 
There should be equal eye candy for all!

Button Up: Your Audience is UnderageWhen They’re Legal, There’s No Scandal Nothing New About a Racy Photo Shoot

NOTHING WRONG WITH FEEDING THE LEGACY TREE 

Applying to college is a task that I wouldn’t wish even on my worst enemy. It is highway robbery committed in 
the name of higher education — universities 
take your $60, scorn your thought-out applica-
tion and make you ashamed you bought their 
T-shirt when you visited the campus. 

The process might not be so stressful for 
those whose shared DNA with an alumnus 
gives them a significant advantage when apply-
ing to some private schools, a practice that 
some want to stop. However, a private school is 
just another business — it too reserves the right 
to refuse service to anyone. 

Being a “legacy” at a university means that 
one or both of the student’s parents graduated 
from the school, and that this family connection 
increases the student’s chances to gain admis-
sion. The higher admittance rate of alumni’s 

sons and daughters has made the news, with 
Princeton admitting 41.7 percent of legacy 
applicants in 2009 — 4.5 times the rate of non-
legacies. And at Notre Dame, the admissions 
rate for alumni children is 50 percent, double 
the university’s overall acceptance rate. 

As products of a public school, none of 
UCSD’s students benefited from legacy admis-
sions, and none of our children will benefit 
from their parents having made it through four 
years here. Private schools have the right to 
go about admissions in whatever way is best 
for the university — even if that means giving 
Miss “Born Wearing a Stanford Sweatshirt” an 
admission over me. 

Many have spoken out against the nepotism 
of legacy admissions, including Richard D. 
Kahlenberg who recently detailed his argument 
in his book “Affirmative Action for the Rich.” 

According to Kahlenberg’s study, legacy admis-
sions apply to no more than 100 of the nation’s 
3,500 public and private universities. There are 
many private schools that are not competitive 
enough for legacy to make a difference, and 
public schools could not care less where your 
parents got their degrees. However, waging a 
war against this archaic practice isn’t worth the 
energy because private school’s legacy admis-
sion policies affects very few applicants — yet 
these students complain because they are com-
peting for the best schools in the nation. 

Private universities need to think of the

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
The balance at stake in the issue of 

the A.S. media budget is between the 
unique importance of the media orgs on 
campus, and the need to correct a his-
tory of overlooked funding habits that 
turned the media budget into an unnec-
essary financial strain on the council and 
the students it represents. The current 
legislative solution, the $450 per quarter 
cap, is an extreme sacrifice of the former 
to the latter, and is too drastic to be con-
sidered a responsible sacrifice. 

One alternative the council could 
consider was a more gradual reduction 
of the media budget. While the council 
weaned the orgs off dependence on A.S. 
Council funds, the orgs could have had 
time to build reliable advertising and 
fundraising practices without the risk of 
losing significant publication power — 
indeed, for some smaller papers, the risk 
of losing that power altogether. The sud-
denness of the current budget cut may 
reduce the number of issues produced 
by each org, thus reducing their ability 
to advertise, which in turn reduces the 
resources A.S. Council would be obliged 
to provide them under the current ver-
sion of the new legislation. This cycle is 
a significant obstacle for the media orgs 
struggling with their new independence. 
You can bet that none of the publications 

you see next quarter will look, feel or 
read anything like they did this fall.

By the time you read this, the council 
will probably have made its final, and 
likely fateful, decision. Whatever they 
do, it is likely that most of the media 
orgs will survive the decision, though 
they may struggle for the rest of this 
year. They’ll likely regain some ground 
next year, when the council will be able 
to provide a more consistent source of 
funding. Just remember that there are 
alternatives to the current cold-turkey 
$450 cap, and in the future, changes on 
this scale should be made incrementally.

Dear Editor,
First, regarding the Oct. 25 article 

I would like to point out that I am not 
pursuing the position of Associate Vice 
President of College Affairs. One of 
my main reasons is that it is time for 
someone new to pursue a chance to 
be on A.S. Council and provide a new 
perspective to the campus community. 
I am very proud of my successors Grant 
White and Matthew Vu for addressing 
issues of institutional inequality and the 
struggles of the underserved students. 
Additionally, I would like to dispense 
what I foresee as the weakness behind 

this council, which is the lack of respect 
especially for the A.S. President. It is cur-
rently midway through Fall Quarter, and 
in order for council to work effectively 
together a sense of professionalism needs 
to be learned. What was shown through 
the budget meetings was that the VP 
Finance was trying to blame the presi-
dent for the budget discrepancy, despite 
the fact it is also his role. Additionally, 
other council members trying to draft 
a separate budget unnecessarily com-
plicated matters further and was disre-
spectful not only to the president but to 
the student body whose fees should not 
be used as political leverage. It is pain-
fully obvious the type of situation that is 
created for the president, and the posi-
tion is stressful enough. Being on A.S. 
Council is more than just another item 
to write on one’s resume. It means these 
individuals have developed themselves 
as leaders and are capable of conducting 
themselves as leaders to serve the stu-
dent body in the best way possible.

Lack of  Professionalism 
Hinders Council Duties

Like It or Not, Colleges Operate 
Under a Business Mentality
future of their enterprise, because, 
unlike public universities, they are not 
guaranteed money from the state every 
year. It’s sometimes forgotten that 
higher education is a business. And as 
a business, they need to act like a busi-
ness to survive. They need to advertise, 
promote their brand, and invest — 
even if it means investing in students 
with the hope that their parents will 
donate.

It may seem that successful uni-
versities like Harvard and Yale, which 
have students ready to sell their souls 
for spots in the freshman class, don’t 
need to cater to their alumni. But 
these alumni are the people who gush 
about their alma maters at college fairs, 
proudly cover their cars with stickers 
and buy season tickets every year to 
cheer on the football team.  Allowing 
these children to come back to their 
parent’s beloved university is not just 
about encouraging donations; it’s also 
about creating a community of people 
who are free good-will ambassadors for 
the school.  

It’s because of the alumni that some 
private schools are as successful as 
they are today. Take USC, for example, 
which had an acceptance rate of 70 
percent in 1997 but gained enough 
popularity to turn away students with 

a 24 percent acceptance rate this past 
year. USC’s powerful network of com-
mitted alumni who bleed red and gold 
are the reason the school has skyrock-
eted to become a top-notch university 
and a thriving business. The univer-
sity looks to keep its alumni close by 
admitting their children and maintain-
ing that loyalty. 

It’s not like they’re letting in air-
heads over smarter but less connected 
students — the New York Times found 
that the average legacies’ SAT scores 
at Middlebury were higher than that 
of the school’s non-legacy admitted 
students.

It is easy to see why most students 
don’t like the idea of legacy admissions 
— it helps only a handful and leaves 
the rest of us relying on our test scores 
and countless extracurriculars to make 
us stand out. But we have to remember 
that universities are businesses first 
— like any other enterprise, they need 
to keep their brand name strong and 
their customers coming back. Private 
colleges should scratch the polite, 
long-winded standby of the “We regret 
to inform you…” rejection letter, and 
revert to the more direct message of: 
“It’s not personal, it’s business.”

and doing none of them well,” the authors claim. 
“They are staffed by casts of thousands and dedicated to 
everything from esoteric research to vocational training 
— and have lost track of their basic mission to challenge 
the minds of young people.”

Colleges are letting in more students even as they 
raise prices, without offering any guarantee that stu-
dents can succeed once they graduate. UCSD’s admis-
sions rate has risen by 3 percent in the last 10 years 

(from 38 percent to 41 percent), while the average cost 
of attending the school has increased by about 9 percent 

in the last year alone.

In fact, according to MSN.com, the average 
American college student is more than $20,000 in debt 
at graduation, and the typical salary for recent grads is 
only $30,000. The average post-graduate starting sal-
ary for UCSD alumni is $47,000, while recent Harvard 
grads make about $57,300 a year and those at Cal State 
Stanislaus make about $40,000.

There is a correlation between a student’s tuition 
costs and his or her future paychecks, according to 
Stanford professor of economics Alan Krueger and 
economist Stacy Dale. In a paper for the National 
Bureau of Economic Research, they used national 
tuition and earnings data to conclude that the higher 
tuition students pay for university, the higher their 
average starting salary is.

Because more expensive schools also have more 
resources, more opportunities for study and more staff, 
this inherently lends them prestige and can have a posi-
tive impact on a student’s overall education.

 The question is if the students at these schools are 
really getting their money’s worth for such an enormous 
investment. Whether a school is public or private, large 
or small, liberal arts or technical, prestigious or lesser-
known all play a role in the type of education a student 
receives, with professor-student relationships a crucial 
variable in all situations.

All professors are required by definition to com-
plete community service, to teach and to publish 

research, according to academic adminis-
trator Jon Welch. In order to con-
duct any research, professors must 
apply to outside sources, such as 
the Department of Education or the 
Environmental Protection Agency, 
for grants that are then processed 
through the university. A chemis-
try professor starting research, for 
example, will need funds to cover 

the use of lab facilities, the purchase of new equipment, 
professional fees, conference fees and the $27,000 sala-
ries each for about 10 graduate students to help in the 
lab — all of which must come from grants.

At public schools like UCSD, professors that are 
tenured or about to become so are paid by the state, 
and other professors must find funding on their own. 
Although much of professors’ salaries can be attributed 
to the costs of initiating research, such as setting up a 
lab (the average salary of UCSD professors is $135,400), 

this does not account for the discrepancy between 
salaries at public and private universities. The average 
salary of full professors is $109,569 at public universi-
ties and $144,256 at private ones, according to the 
American Association of University Professors.

While the size, location or specialties of a school 
don’t play a direct role in this discrepancy, prestige may 
come into play. Private schools usually have stricter 
standards for admittance and higher rates of tuition 
than their public counterparts, drawing high-profile 
teachers and the students willing to pay to learn from 
them.

This year is the first time ever that UCSD surpassed 
$1 billion dollars accrued in research funding from 
grants, ranking fifth among top U.S. universities in 
federal research and development funding, and distin-
guishing itself as a top competitor in the public school 
sphere.

Indirectly, grant money is the major source of 
income for any institution; at Cornell University, for 
example, 60 percent of all grant money won by profes-
sors went to fund the school’s general overhead. This 
percentage is much smaller at UCSD, but the average 
$28,000 paid yearly by each in-state undergraduate in 
fees and living expenses is still a small proportion of 
the school’s income.

FOCUSÊ MONDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2010Ê THE UCSD GUARDIAN 7 

If you’ve spent most of your college years honing your pseu-
do-warrior skills with video games like “Call of Duty-Modern 
Warfare 2”, it’s time to crank it up a notch and head over to 
Camp Pendleton — for paintball, that is. About a 40-minute 
drive north, hidden eight miles inside the navy base and open 

every Friday, Saturday and Sunday from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., this 
paintball park has the intensity and realism only a United States 
Marine base can offer.

Military police will meet you at the gate, ask you where 
you’re going and request to see your license and registration. 
Once you provide the necessary documentation and tell them 
you’re just there for paintball, drive about seven miles straight 
into the camp. Look for a brown building with paintball sup-
plies and hoards of kids (most players appear to be under the 
age of 13) setting up their gear out front.

Once you enter the premises, it’s clear that you’re in non-
fatal-combat heaven. The base has six separate paintball arenas, 
each with its own unique set of barricades, obstacles and ter-
rain.  The fan favorite is an arena the size of a football field, with 
plenty of retired military vehicles to hide behind (a rusty tank, 
an old trailer, a downed airplane) plus trenches and makeshift 
huts for added protection against small children wielding guns.

For players with their own equipment, the price is $15, but 
if you lack the gun, face mask, paintballs and ammunition belt, 
the full day rental package is $45. For those trying to save up for 
the next edition of “Halo”, go on a Friday, when rental walk-ons 

can play for only $30. 
The rental package includes a disturbingly lethal-looking 

gun, 500 paintballs, an ammo carrying case and a mask that 
smells deadly in and of itself.  If you have never touched any-
thing even vaguely resembling a gun, a staffer is on hand to help 
fumbling new players figure out how to load and shoot. Once a 
stocky Marine shouts the basic rules at you, it’s game on.  

Walk-ons are divided into two teams, one group sporting 
bright yellow headbands, and separated on opposite ends of the 
arena. The five-minute game begins when the Marine shouts 
“Go!” and it’s an adrenaline-fueled fight to the finish — or just 
a haphazard scramble to make it out without getting shot in 
the face.  To survive the elimination-style feeding frenzy, you 
have to keep moving. Tips: Hiding in buildings isn’t as useful 
as you might think, due to gaping holes in the walls, and mov-
ing around without a buddy doesn’t make you look cool, it just 
makes you easy prey. But all clever strategies go out the window 
once the firing begins — it’s every man for himself. 

Even though paintballing is as fake as Super Smash Brothers, 
the experience inside the arena is intense.  Running from build-
ing to building and stumbling over fake rubble adds to the 
collection of bruises running down your arms and yes, you 
will get bruised — a lot. Pair your weekend attire with a long-
sleeved jacket and jeans to avoid getting shot on bare skin. Also, 
the paint stains, so don’t show up wearing your favorite white 
V-neck from American Apparel unless you feel like adding 
some Pollock flair. 

If the idea of spending a day running away from perfect 
strangers (most of whom are still in middle school) while they 
shoot mercilessly at you sounds fun, Camp Pendleton is your 
best bet. It’s an exciting, physically demanding experience that, 
at the very least, will make you better appreciate your over-
worked “Call of Duty” avatar.

grants give students opportunities to collaborate with profes-
sors and peers in hands-on learning situations, although the 
1,181 faculty currently employed by the university to work 
with 23,143 undergrads and 4,274 grad students is a far cry 
from intellectual intimacy.

“There are 300 students in my upper division science class, 
and the professor’s office hours are one hour per week,” one 
Sixth College senior said, who asked to remain anonymous. 

“How can I possibly interact on a personal level when there’s 
a hostile line of students you have to out-compete for atten-
tion and help?”

Overall, the relevance of millions in grant money for stu-
dents, especially undergraduates, is up for debate — especially 
since forming close enough relationships with professors to 
set yourself up for a research opportunity is easier said than 
done. 

Lacking the national prestige of a large private university 

and the intimacy of a small school, UCSD hovers in a realm 
all its own, forcing students to take advantage of whatever 
slim opportunities they have to get involved. UCSD offers 
undergrads a learning environment rich in research dollars 
and diversity, but one that is forced by its size to subjugate the 
individual to the masses, so that students have to evaluate for 
themselves whether the classes are worth the cost.

play still tied 1-1.
“We came out really strong, and 

had bits of brilliance throughout 
the game,” junior goalkeeper Kristin 
Armstrong said. “But there were 
times where we didn’t play as well as 
we could, and it hurt us in the end.” 

The two teams went into penalty 
kicks to break the draw. Sophomore 
defender Ellen Wilson shot first for 
the Tritons, but her attempt was saved 
by San Francisco State goalkeeper 
Anicia Jones. The score remained 
tied after the Gators also failed to 
finish their first penalty. Senior Lisa 
Bradley converted her penalty kick, 
as did Gator forward Nicole Vanni. 
The next four shooters would all 
finish their attempts, bringing the 

score to 3-3. Alison Day missed the 
Gators’ final shot, giving UCSD’s 
Sarah McTigue a chance to end the 
game. But McTigue could not convert 
from the spot.

Still tied after five shots apiece, the 
shootout went to sudden death pen-
alties.  The Gators’ Myriah Johnson 
finished her attempt, putting them 
up 4-3. Ilg was called up to take the 
shot for the Tritons, but was unable 
to finish, putting the Gators into the 
CCAA finals on Sunday. 

The loss marks the second con-
secutive year the Tritons have been 
eliminated from the CCAA semi-
finals from penalty kicks, after they 
lost to Cal State Dominguez Hills last 
season.  

“I’m not sure what went on during 

the penalty kicks, but almost every 
field player misses a penalty kick at 
least once in their life,” Armstrong 
said. “All we can do is put it behind 
us so we can continue to have confi-
dence in future shootouts.” 

Because not all conferences hold 
postseason tournaments, the selec-
tion committee puts little weight on 
them in their decisions. Barring an 
unexpected snub, the Tritons will 
continue into the regional finals, 
where they will likely be accompa-
nied by CCAA finalists Cal State Los 
Angeles, 2007-08 national champions 
Seattle Pacific University and West 
Region No. 1 BYU-Hawaii.

MEN’S WATERPOLO — In an intense match 
Friday night, the No. 12 Triton men’s water 
polo team fell 8-7 to No. 5 UC Irvine.

UCI gained control of the ball right off the 
sprint to score within the first minute. UCSD’s 
senior driver Bryce Madsen responded, as he 
caught a rebound and found the net. After 
UCI scored again, junior driver Graham Saber 
evened up the score once more, bringing the 
game to 2-2 going into the second period.

The second quarter saw UCI gain the first 
two-point lead of the game, but in an impres-
sive offensive set from the Tritons senior Jakub 
Bednarek found net to bring the score to 4-3.

UCSD intercepted a UCI pass, but the 
Tritons’ Bednarek was called for an offen-
sive foul and the ball was turned over to the 
Anteaters. UCI capitalized on the call and 
found net, again bringing the team ahead by 
two goals.

UCSD head coach Denny Harper took 
issue with the call on Bednarek, and his 
discussion with the referee over the matter 
earned the coach a red card that put him out 
for the rest of the game.

Going into the third period, UCI was able 
to convert a six-on-five advantage to bring 
the score to 6-3. The Tritons fought back, and 
junior goalie David Morton tossed a long pass 
to Saber, who shot it into goal. 

Sophomore utility John Butler made a 
tough shot and brought the score back within 
a one-point difference to 6-5 at the end of the 
third quarter.

The last quarter was a close fight as the 
teams traded goals twice, leaving the Tritons 
unable to get out from under UCI’s lead. With 
1:12 on the clock, Morton made a crucial 
stop and UCSD gained possession, but an 
attempt to tie the game up failed with a block 
by Johnson and the score showed at 8-7 at the 
final buzzer. 

Despite the loss, team members said 
they played well and are looking forward to 
upcoming matches. 

“We’re clearly making progress; we played 
a lot harder and a lot better than we did 
Tuesday night, so we’re clearly moving for-
ward and gaining momentum going into 
WWPA’s,” Saber said. “If we come out playing 
like this, it’ll be good for us; we have to keep 
playing with a lot of heart and a lot of effort 
like that game, and it’ll be good.” 

The Tritons will be back in the Canyonview 
Pool this Sunday at 12 p.m. to face No. 19 
Pomona-Pitzer and to honor seniors Allred, 
Bednarek and Madsen.

Triton Water 
Polo Drops Close 
8-7 Decision to 
UC Irvine 

Swimming and Diving  
Lose to UC Santa 
Barbara in Duel Meet 

By Tyler Nelson
Associate Sports Editor

The UCSD Swimming and Diving teams visited UC Santa Barbara for a duel meet on Saturday to face a Gaucho team whom they had never beaten. The Tritons came close, but 
couldn’t muster the endurance, and both the men and women fell to 
the Gauchos. 

“We were looking to upset them,” junior captain Michael Lorch 
said, “but the guys lost by about 30 points and the women lost as well.”

The Triton men fell by a close margin of 161.5-137.5, and the 
women lost 175.5-118.5. 

Thanks in part to the outstanding performance of their diving 
teams, the Tritons came closer to beating the Gauchos than they 
have in recent years. The men’s and women’s diving teams won both 
the 1-meter and the 3-meter diving, and freshman Luke Calkins and 
sophomore Tyler Runsten both qualified for nationals.

But the Tritons’ performance fell off in the water. The men won 
four events while the women won five, but the depth of their UCSB 
opponents was too much for the Tritons, and the slim lead they 
accrued from the diving events quickly evaporated.

On the men’s side, freshman Nick Korth continued his outstanding 
start to his collegiate career, taking first in both the 100-yard breast-
stroke and the 200-breast stroke, with a time of 56.95 and 2:04.75, 
respectively. The 2:04.75 is two seconds faster than his nearest com-
petition. The Tritons also took the top three spots in the 100 freestyle, 
with junior Griffin Bracke winning with a time of 59.94.

On the women’s side, All-American junior captain Alex Henley 
continued her early season domination, winning the 200-individual 
medley (2:08.56) and taking second in the 200 butterfly and 1000 
freestyle. Freshman Anji Shakya also delivered a first place finish in 
the 200 freestyle with a time of 1:53.38.

“We expected to do a little better than we did,” Lorch said, “and 
we were a little disappointed by the result, but a lot of people actually 
swam faster than they ever swam in a duel meet and it puts us in good 
position for Arena Cup coming up.”

The men take next week off as the women travel to University of 
San Diego. In two weeks, both teams will travel to Long Beach for 
the Arena Invitational, which will include some of the top teams in 
California.

the men’s 100 free and sweeping the podium in both men’s diving events.

Womens 
Soccer 
Falls 4-3 in 
Penalty Kicks

By Rachel Uda
S���� W��� � �

WOMENS SOCCER  The No. 9 
womens soccer team saw its 10-game 
winning streak snapped in a penalty 
kick shootout last Friday, as Tritons 
fell in the CCAA playoffs against San 
Francisco State University.  

The teams played to a 1-1 draw, 
but the Tritons lost 4-3 in penalty 
kicks. The loss eliminated the Tritons 
from the conference finals. But since 
all penalty shootout losses are rec-
ognized as a tie in conference and 
national rankings, the Tritons remain 
unbeaten in the past 14 matches and 
should maintain their spot in the 
national tournament. A selection 
committee will determine the seeds 
and sites for the NCAA Division-II 
championships. 

UCSD opened the scoring early 
in the match, when forward Annette 
Ilg received a cross from sophomore 
defender Hayley Johnson in the 13th 
minute. Ilg  recently named the 
CCAA Newcomer of the Year  fin-
ished for her ninth goal of the season 
to put UCSD up 1-0.  

The Tritons 1-0 lead was cut 
down five minutes into the second 
half, when 511 Gator midfielder 
Carly Bliss headed a cross in from 
the end line. This goal would be San 
Francisco States only shot on goal for 
the entire match. Despite a number 
of dangerous chances UCSD had in 
front of the Gator goal, the two teams 
ended the regulation and overtime

TRITONS RACK UP ROAD WINS TO BRING WINNING STREAK TO 10 MATCHES
By Liam Rose
S����� E��� ��

WOMENS VOLLEYBALL  The 
UCSD womens volleyball team picked 
up two more road wins over the week-
end, extending its winning streak to 10 
matches. 

The Tritons trounced Cal State 
Dominguez Hills on Friday night, sweep-
ing the season series with the Toros with-
out dropping a set. UCSD then staged a 
dramatic comeback against Cal State Los 
Angeles on Saturday, dropping the first 
two games before storming back for the 
five-set victory. 

Against Dominguez Hills, the Tritons 
swept the match 3-0 with set scores of 
25-13, 25-19 and 25-13. Junior Roxy 
Brunsting had nine kills and 15 assists 
while junior Janessa Werhane had 15 digs, 
as the Tritons dominated the match and 
limited the Toros to paltry .035 hitting 

percentage. 
Dominguez Hills remained rooted to 

the bottom of the standings with the loss, 
falling to 3-22 overall and 2-17 in confer-
ence play.

The Tritons faced a much tougher 
test against Cal State Los Angeles, as the 
Golden Eagles shot out to an early 2-0 
lead with 25-15 and 25-21 victories in the 
first two sets. UCSD hit just .131 in the 
first two sets, but came out in the third set 
determined to extend the match by taking 
an early 8-3 lead and not looking back. 
The Tritons won the set 25-14. 

The Golden Eagles had a chance to 
win in the fourth set, as they trailed just 
23-24 at the end of the set. But junior 
Hilary Williamson recorded a kill to win 
the game and the Tritons forced a fifth set.

In the final stanza, the Tritons trailed 
early but went on a 6-1 run and hung on 
for the win. 

Williamson was the star of the night 

for the Tritons, as she sent down a sea-
son-high 20 kills in addition to 13 digs. 
Werhane had a game-high 22 digs, and 
Brunsting added 11 kills, 27 assists and 
four blocks. 

Cal State Los Angeles fell to 14-10 
overall and 11-9 in conference.

The Tritons went to 17-7 overall with 
the wins, including 14-6 in CCAA play. 
While Cal State San Bernardino clinched 
the conference title over the weekend, the 
Tritons remain in a tie for second place 
with Cal State East Bay.

The Tritons face two more road games 
next week, which is the final weekend of 
the regular season. UCSD will face Cal 
Poly Pomona and San Bernardino, and 
victories in both matches would leave the 
squad with a good chance of receiving a 
bid to the NCAA Division-II regionals.

CROSSÊCOUNTRY

By Liam Rose
S���� � E��� � �

The UCSD cross country teams had a good showing at the CCAA Championships on Saturday. Held at the home course of Cal Poly Pomona, the Triton men fin-
ished third out of seven squads competing, while the women 
finished in fifth out of 11 teams.

Overall, were okay with how we did, head coach Nate 
Garcia said. We came in ranked third on the mens side and 
fifth on the womens side and we defended our rankings. But 
obviously, if youre not winning the race youre always hungry 
to do a little bit better. So I feel there are some areas we can 
work on in the next couple weeks.

Senior Jesse Morrill led the way on the mens side, with his 
time of 25:11 over the 8k course landing him in 11th place 
overall. Morrill made his first All-CCAA team by finishing 
in the top 15. Kellen Levy was next for the Tritons, taking 
home CCAA Freshman of the Year honors as the first true 
freshman finisher. Levy finished in 25:38 to place 18th overall. 
Freshman Mario Flores, junior Patrick French and sophomore 
Matt Lenehan rounded out the scoring for the Tritons, with 
21st, 22nd and 26th place finishes, respectively. 

Chico State, one of the top Division II schools for distance 
running, won its ninth consecutive mens title by taking the 
first four spots and six of the top seven. Brent Handa edged 
out teammate Isaac Chavez to take first with a time of 24:41.

UCSD finished with 87 points, trailing only Pomonas 57 
points and Chicos near-perfect 16 points.

On the womens side, sophomore Jackie Sikkema was the 
Tritons top overall finisher, completing the 6k course in 23:14 

to take 25th place. Freshman Chia Chang finished three spots 
back with a time of 23:19. Sophomore Heather Hisgen, fresh-
man Kamilah Foley and sophomore Catherine Crisp took 
32nd, 33rd and 34th to complete the Triton scorers.  

We had a couple gals that were a little under the weather, 
and I feel like that cost us a little, Garcia said. As a whole, we 
feel that on a good day of racing we are in contention for a top 
3 position in the conference. To finish in the top 5 being a little 
off is something that were pleased with, but like I said were 
hungry to go to the next level.

Chico State also took the womens title, making this the 
third consecutive year the Wildcats have garnered both con-
ference championships. Chicos Kara Lubieniecki was the 
overall winner with a time of 21:30, and the Wildcats took 9 of 
the top 10 spots, including their non-scoring runners. 

The Tritons finished with 145 points, putting them behind 
Chico, Pomona, Cal State Stanislaus and just eight back of Cal 
State L.A.

The Tritons will return to action in two weeks for the 
NCAA Division II West Regionals, to be held on Nov. 20 at 
Western Washington University in Bellingham, Wash.

On the mens side, our goal throughout the season has 
been a top five finish, Garcia said. We havent seen any rea-
son to back off that goal. There are things were going to have 
to improve, but the guys are really committed to it.

The NCAA Regional course is hillier and more challeng-
ing than Pomonas, which Garcia said will work in his squads 
favor. 

Western Washingtons course is much more representative 
of what weve been preparing ourselves for this season as com-
pared to the conference course, Garcia said. The conference 
course is essentially a road race on dirt: really flat and really 
fast. I think weve got one of the toughest mens and womens 
teams around, so a strength-oriented course suits us well.
