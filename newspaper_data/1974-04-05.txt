Disntissal 
Possible 

'by Chris Rauber 
Boardmember Ron Roberts opened an emergency 

meeting of the Communications Board Wednesday by 
moving. thPt the editor-iD-chief of the Triton Times and 
those responsible for the first page of the April 2 Triton 
Times be dismissed. 

The special meeting was called in response to the 
explosive reaction of the campus community to satirical 
articles featured on the paper's special April Fools Day 
page. 

More than fifty people crowded into the conference 
,'oom to participate in an emotional, tension-packed, 
hour-long discussion . The Triton Times was charged 
wi th racism, insensitivity to minorities, and a bias 
against Third College. r: leo Malone, Muir College 
Resident Dean, said that the articles in question 
promoted racial tension and disunity . He demanded 
that "such attempts at humor be redirected." 

The Triton Times, represented by Editor-in-<:hief 
David Buchbinder, took the position that the front page 
was intended as a satirical attack on the insensitivity 
and institutional raci sm of the university,. and not as an 
attack against Third College or any minority group. 

A large number of Third College students participated 
In the discussion . ()ne student labeled the paper as 
"Tasteless shit" and claimed that it defamed and 
degraded Third College. Another said she "didn' t think it 
was funny . These thinRs happen over and over .. this isn't 
the firs t time." It was suggested that the staff members 
responsible be fired and that the standing of the Triton 
Times as the official student newspaper be revoked and 
Its funding redistributed to other student newspapers. 

"This trash shouldn't be published as the official 
studE;nt newspaper," one student contended. 

The mood of the assembled students was summed up 
by a woman who argued that the front page " couldn't 
be taken as irony because its too close to the truth ." 

A decision on the matter was postponed, due to 
Editor Buchbinder' s contention that the by-laws of the · 
Communication Board's constitution had not been 
followed in the meeting's procedure, until Monday, 
April 8 at 3 o'clock. 

Libertarian 
Hospers Assails 

Government 
by James G. Sofo 

Jo hn Ho s p e r s , 
gubanatorial candidate for 
the libertarian party in 
Ca l ifornia , said Tuesday 
night at Revelle College 
that "government is the 
legalized use of force and 
wields a monopoly in the 
legalized use of force". 

Dr . Hospers is t he 
chairman of the philosophy 
departme nt at the 
University of Southern 
California and was the 
Libertaria n party ' s ca n-· 
didate fo r President in 1972. 
Hospers attracted more 
attention after the election 
when one of the Virginia 
el ectors pledged to 
President Nixon cast his 
vote in the electoral college 
'for H John Hosper 

Hospers was at UCSD to 
be the first speaker in 
Extension Economic lecture 
seri es about Libertarian and 
Conservative economic 
philosophy. The lecture 
series is chaired by Dr. 
Daniel ()rr professor of 
f' onomics here at UCSD 
dnd wi ll later in th quarter 
have M . Stanton [vans of 
the N ational ReVi ew, 
AmPri an Constitutional 
Union, and roitor of the 
Indianapo lis News 

Hospers said, that the 
two major points in 
Li bertarian philosophy as 
being that "you are the 
owner of your life, that no 
one owns you, and ~ach 

person has the right to do 
what they want without 
impinging on other peoples 
rights; and that no person 
should initiate the use of 
fo rce against another 
person." 

Hospers believes the 
major violators of these 
precepts are not individuals 
but rath e r governm ent . 
These liberties are lost to 
two means, crimes against 
persons and crimes against 
property. 

When asked whether he 
was a conservative, liberal, 
or middle of the roader 
Hospers laughed and said 
he didn't know how to 
answer that question and 
said that " people conside' 
libertarians conservative if 
eco'lomic liberties an( 
liberal in matters of civil 
liberties. 

Hospers said "the state 
should first be a protector, 
and then a referee . . . He 
continued by calling 
governmental subsidies are 
not more than robbery. 

Hospers emphasized at 
the end of his lecture that 
he believes that without 
economic freedoms the 
other freedoms will not last 
very long. 

The response of the 
audience was enthusiastic 
with Hospers talk was often 
interrupted by laughter in 
response to his generally 
witty talk. 

Approximately 75 people 
attended the talk

Editorial 
Re: 'April Fool' 

The front page of Tuesday's issue of the Triton 
Times was an attempt at ironic satire about several 

iss~es faCing the University today . Irony, as we see 
it , IS an attempt at political criticism by the 
exaggeration of current situations to the pOint where 
the situation seems ludicrous. This is what we tried 
to do with the articles on constuctions of third 
college, the provost of Third College and Af-
firmative Action . ' 

The intent of our articles was apparently 
misinterpreted by many people on campus . Our 
intended positions ,respectively were : outrage over 
the attempt to belittle and destroy Third College by 
not constructing any buildings which would give it a 
sense of permanence ; outrage over the ad-
ministration's and to some extent the faculty 's 
treatment of Th ird College students as second class 
citizens (hence the choice of Shockley) ; and also 
outrage and disgust over the hypocritical and in-
sincere handling of affirmitive action by the whole 
University community . The editorial of the same 
issue criticizing the University's handling of af-
firmative action should land credence that this was 
the intent . 

We deeply regret that we apparently failed to 
many people in our attempts at irony. We realize 
that these misjudgements are indicative of our lack 
of solidarity with several groups on campus . This 
situation must change , and will change . This is our 
intent for the future . 

All comments pro or con should be directed to the 
Student Affairs Office at 250 Matthews Campus to 
Michael Weiss, Mark Bookman , or any other 
member of the Commun ications Board before 3 
PM Monday .

More Money for Assistantships 
by Philip Protter 

The Regents have authorized what they call a "salary 
supplement" for the following: TA's, RA's, OA's, LA's, 
Teaching Fellows, Physical Activit i!" Assistants, and 
Nursery School Assistants. It is retroactively effective 
with the fall quarter, 1973. While t he amount of the 
"salary supplementation" is based o n the educational 
fee, and it is independent of the source of the em-
ployee's funding, it would appear that this is a rebate of 
the student's educational fee . In this case, of course, the 
money wou ld not be taxed . However, as a "sa lary 
supplementation" the money will be subject to 
withholding tax. The reporter can only conclude that 
the notion that the recipients are being taxed on a 
refund of their own money is just an illusion . 

The educational fee is one hundred twenty dollars per 
quarter. For those students employed as above in a half-
time capacity, the "supplementation" will be sixty 
dollars each quarter, less taxes . Those who are em-

ployed less than 50 per cent time will have their 
"supplemenation" pro-rated . 

The fi rst check will come through payroll , and ap-
parent ly is expected at any time It will be the sup-
plementation for the first quarter only. The check for 
the spring quarter is expected about June 15 

According to Dean Pierce (Dean of Graduate 
Studies), the Regents asked for a salary increase in order 
to make the assistantships more compet it ive with other 
leading universities. This was approved by the 
legislature, but blue-penciled out of the budget 
someplace along the line. Consequently the Regents 
have used their "Opportunity funds" to make the 
supplementation possible . These funds are non-state 
funds obtained by overhead charges from contracts and 
grants. As far as Dean Pierce knows, thiS is a permanent 
sa lary supplement. At any rate, It wil l conti nue next 
year. The delay in disbusement of the money is at-
tr ibuted to the bureaucracy of University Hall 

The Great Watertank Controversy 

Th defaced exterior ut 
the old water tower bet-
ween Revelle and Matthews 
campus is likely to remain 
an eyesore, at least until 
this summer. 

Dr . Newton Harrison , 
chai rman of the Visual Arts 
Department, now in the 
process of moving eight 
vis ual · art faculty into 
studios in the rennovated 
building, and Robert Davis, 
ass istant to the campus 
architect, each made this 
sam e dec isi on without 
conferr ing with each other. 

Work on the 30 year-old 
water tank I nea rly 
completed. The on e empty 
tank has been filled with 
walls and wires and is now 
roofed to accomodate eight

already rece ived one coat

first week of March. 

This init ia l coat of paint 
covered up a ix year-old 
mural, and purred ad-
mierer of the mural to 
complain to University 
planners about the a tion 

To coverup th black and

at least two more coats of

Y "C rt " Vets: Return our e s 
The Veterans Administration has timely advice for 

one million veterans studying at colleges and univer-
sities under the G. I. Bill : 

Return those "cert" cards promptly to insure payment 
of education allowances for the final month of training. 

Officials e)(plained that the certification of at-
tendance card the veteran receives with the ne)(t to final 
check should be filled out; signed and returned to the 
VA regional office. Otherwise, the agency can't prepare 
a final check for the current school year. 

For most veterans, final months of training are lV1ay or 
june, and most "cert" cards will be mailed in April. 
Forms already have been mailed to veterans whose 
enrollment periods end earlier, howE!'oler. 

The officials cited another reason veterans should 
return their "cert" cards promptly : 

"If the cards are not returned at the end of the current 
semester," they stressed, "the veterans cannot 
automatically be enrolled for upcoming summer or fall 
sessions, if they plan to continue ."

Women's Center 
Plans Activities 

" Beyond The Mystique" 
is the theme women at 
University of California, San 
Diego have chosen for a 
month of activities being 
held April 5-May {, in 
connection with the 
opening of their new 
Women's Center 

Three nationally 
prominent women will 
speak at the University 
during the month as guest 
lecturers on the "Women 
Scientists Speak Out" 
portion of the prOlram. The 
three will report on current 
research findings of 
significance to women's 
struggle for equality. Dates 
of these major addresses are 
April 12, April 18, and lV1ay

scientific lectures - films, 
discussions, and artistic, 
musical and dramatic 
E!'oIents wi II take place. 

According to Belinda 
Brav, one of several 
students active in founding 
the Women's Center, all 
"women's month" activities 
are free and open to the 
public. The Center will 
function as an ongoing 
resource and referral 
facility, and a meeting 
place for both pl.,ned and 
informal gatherinas.

Correction 
A few iclarifications must 

be made on my article of 
March 16 on the problems 
of UC libraries . Although I 
stated the Library Policy 
Task Force has accepted a 
report from UCSD Librarian 
Mel Voight, this was an 
error on my part. Voight's 
has not been accepted by 
the committee on this time . 

In addition the com-
mittee has not made any 
conclusions at this time and 
will make a report latet' this

I apologize to Dr. jackson

Force if any misun-
derstandings have arisen 
from my article.

Faculty Discusses Bargaining 
U lA political sc ience 

professor David Wilson told 
the UCSD Academic. Senate 
Wednesday that instructors 
should begin to prepare for 
the eventual granting of 
collective bargaining rights 
to academic personnel. 

Wilson, who is chairman 
of the UCLA Academic

Moses and Aurelius found their trip across the desert 

more to their liking this time. They sold the sheep and 
took a movie flight. The movie, incidentally, was " If 
This is the Sabbath, Then it Must Be the Day of Rest." 

They disembarked at Rameses International. 
" Moses," Marcus said, "i t occurs to me that I don't 

know how we're going to get our people out of Mogen." 
You 'll excuse me if I don't get too worked up about it, 

Marcus . You know as much as I ." 
Marcus glanced suspic iously at Moses. "Are you 

trving to insult me?" . 
The two hopefu l Heb rews checked into th e S Lwe 

Hilton After a refresh ing mud bath , the two settled II1to 
the l3itter Suite. 

"Too bad there aren' t any burning bushes around here 
to tell us what to do, eh Moses?" 

Moses smiled . " Ah, but there you're wrong, Marc ." He 
reached into his pocket and withdrew a plastiC bag that 
con tained an alfalfa-like substance . " I brought some of 
the bush with me. Set up the incense burner, Marcus ." 

Moses took a few pinches of the leaf and stuffed it 
into the burner. He pulled out his lighter and put the 
flame to the weed . This time it was consumed. Moses 
cupped his hands (two, you' ll remember) over his 
mouth and nose and opened them just enough to admit 
the top of the burner. He took a great whiff and held it a 
w hile. 

"Ah," he e)(haled finally, " yeah ." 
Marcus was puzzled. 
" Here, " Moses offered, " try it." 
Marcus took the burner hesitantly but tried it . 
"Wow!" he commented . " It sure doesn't taste like 

tomato juice." 
" Now leave me," Moses commanded, "me and the 

Big Man have things to discuss ." 

So it was tliat Moses and Marcus went to the Palace 
of Eternal Time-Motion Studies and came face-to-face 
with Deep Heet, disgusting though it sounds. 

Moses approached Pharaoh and winked at his wife-or 
maybe her son, the Paraohling. 

" let my people go," Moses said, anxious to get off to 
a diplomatic start. 

"Your people, ha!" Pharaoh laughed. " jeeves," he 
commanded, "Bring the receipt for Mogen ." 

"Wait!" cried Moses. " It won't be necessary; for my 
sta ff is better than yours." He took his staff and (liang? 
flought?) flung it to the floor whereupon it turned into a 
snake. 

"Oh yeah?" Deep Heet snarled " Well , my staff's pretty 
good, too. Kissingerl Haldeman! Erlichman! Front and 
center!" The three aides ran up the steps and stood 
before Pharaoh . He rose from his chair, pushed them 
onto the floor and pointed to them. "Alright, clowns, 
make like snakes!" 

The three slithered and ~rithered on the floor, hissing 
and darting their tongues to and fro. But Moses' snake 
ate them. 

"Goddammit!" Pharaoh muttered. 
" I that a request?" Marcus asked. 
" I warn you , Pharaoh, either let the Hebrews go or 

Cod will plague you ."

" Aw, bug off, Moses Your god doesn't sc.are me" 
" So be it!" thundered Moses. "Tomorrow thi s land 

will be plagued by beetles" And he and Marcus left 
Early the ne)(t morning, the sound of small engines 

could be heard in the east, right in the hea(f of a dust 
cloud moving west. Soon they could be seen : millions 
of Volkwagens, each the size of a small cat. As soon as 
they reached the city of Memphis, they broke out of 
their orderly columns and scattered in every direction 
but back . 

As if by prior arrangement, asquadron of eight million 
or so beetles made a great slicing manuever aimed at 
the granaries in the heart of the city . After a Maginotic 
defense, the granaries fell to the invaders, who could be 
seen eating grain as if there were no tomorrow. 

Tomorrow looked ~k indeed to Pharaoh. He was 
bathing in the Styx when thousands of little buzz ing 
beetles ran into the water and made a bee-line for his 
Pharosity. Deep Heet dove under and made the coast 
unscathed. He stood looking at them as he gathered his 
robes about him. "Ye gods!" he cried . " The damnable 
things float .'~ 

One week later, Moses approached Deep Heet and 
bade him to reconsider. 

"I bid YOU , reconsider." 
" No," said Pharaoh , "a thousand times nol" 
" Eight more will be suffiCient, thank you . But si nce 

you persist in th is p ig-headed attitude, I say unto you : 
the waters of Egypt shall be turned into cold oatmea l! " 
And Moses left . 

By the second day, the Egyptians had run out of sugar 
for the oatmeal. By the fifth day there was a shortage of 
fuel and they had to eat it cold. At week 's end, the 
Egyptians were sick at the very m ntion of oatmea l, 
which explains why to this day there are no Quakers in 
Egypt 

Then the Lord said to Moses, "Let's hit 'em With 
campus unrest! " And Mo es aid unto the Lord, "OK." 

Memphis University became a seething hotbed of 
revolution , and other colleges followed suit . It got so 
that a student cou ldn't even throw a shadow without 
being pummeled by the Praetorian Guard . Pharaoh told 
Moses to take the Hebrew , bu.trefused again after the 
students were quiet. -

Moses went again to Pharaoh with instructions from 
the lord . " Pharaoh , thus says the Lord : let my people 
go or you 'll be sorry. A sickness shall descend upon 
you ." But Pharaoh would not listen . And there 
descended upon the people of Egypt a plague of 
hemorrhoids, and when the supply of Preparation H ran 
out the Egyptians were sorely beset to be seated . 

As you've no doubt guessed by now, Pharaoh Deep 
Heet still wouldn ' t let the Hebrews go . A s a matter of 
fact , even after nine plagues had taken place, Deep 
Heet stili wouldn 't change his mind. So Moses and the 
Lord decided to have a summit conference . The summit 
in question being that of Mt. Aerowax ... 

" Lord, I just don't understand it . This guy's country is 
in a shambles and still he refuses to come t o terms." 

"Well , I had a hand in it. Deep Heet wa s willing to let 
you go after Plague V, but I changed his mind," the lord 
explained. 

" But if that's so, then why-" 
"WhaU " shouted the lord. " And miss a chance to try 

out my plague set? Hardly, Moses. Besides," the Lord 
chuckled, " I rather enjoyed it. It 's lonely at the top, 
Moses." 

"So how many more have you got line up?" 
"Plagues? just one more. It' ll be a good one, I 

guarantee." The lord winked His eye (the upper one, to 
be exact), and annihilated a universe. All in fun , of 
course . 

"What's it to be? Moses questioned. " Soap operas? 
Came shows? Dentists? .. " 

"Wait a minute," said the lord. He paged through His 
book, makin~ a sound like .. . thunder? " Let's' see, uh ... Iet

During the quarter break 
a new student-run bus 
se rvice was begun to serve 
Ocean Beach and PacifiC 
Beach students , faculty and 
staff . The new bus, dubbed 
the " South Sa-eaker", will 
continue to make 7 runs a

Friday, except on school 
holidays . 

The South Streaker will 
go as far south as 
Narragansett Street in 
Ocean Beach and yet it 1'.111 
be fast enough to make the 
trip to UCSD in less than 40 
minutes. This new route is 
an e)(press ru n, but it will 
also wind through part of 
Pacific Beach to pick up 
passengers before it u es

OPINION 

'SIMON SAYS • • • "FETCH"" 

Solzhenitsyn: A Propaganda Tool 

Part Two 
by Mason Powell 

In the unending and steadfast cold war campaign to 
attribute severe degrees of repression and violations of 
civil rights to communist governments, the Western 
propaganda machines attribute greatness to individuals 
whose greatest hope would actually be to achieve 
mediocrity. Alexsandr Solzhenitsyn is a classic example 
of this . Solzhenitsyn is a dedicated anticommunist 
political author, and this is why the "liberal" American 
press promotes him . To make his "persecution" 
significant, Solzhenitsyn himself must be significant, 
hence the thrust of American propaganda has been to 
project him as a mature political thinker and a great 
author, as well as a patriot who " loves his homeland." 

The truth is, as we sha ll see, that Solzhenitsyn is a 
naive political thinker who is opposed to "democracy", 
a mediocre author at best, and in no sense a patriot of 
the Soviet Union . Due to the constant barrage of pro-
Solzhenitsyn propaganda in the media, it is diff icult to 
convince the reader in one article . The London Sunday 
Times , however (which our library does not get) 
published a letter Solzhenitsyn wrote to the Soviet 
leaders, and released to the Times. The New York Times 
of March 3 and 4 reported on the letter, and quoted 
from it. 

Some people I have spoken with have maintained 
Solzhenitsyn is a dedicated communist, and that It is 
from this p rspective that he criticizes the Soviet 
Union's implementation of communism It is in -
conceivable, however, to think that o ne who refers to 
the masses as "rabble" and who has o nly contempt for 
the working class could believe in com munism . But 
Solzhenitsyn wrote in h is letter to Soviet leaders : 
"Whenever any group of workers sei zes a chance to 
grab something extra - never mind if they don 't deserve 
it, never mind if it's morE' than they need-they up and 
grab it and ruin takes society." In his Nobel Prize 
Speech Solzhenitsyn wrote, "The old same primitive 
urges rend and sunder our world -green, envy, licence, 
mutual malevolence, though now they adopt 
euphemisti c pseudonyms as they go, such as 'class 
struggle'. racial struggle', 'the struggle of the masses', 
'the struggle of organised labor' ." (From the Manchester 
Guardian , 2-23-74) . Thi s is not a communist speaking. 

Actually Solzhenitsyn is the SOlliet analogue of 
the American reactionaries who wish to return to the 
past : say, before the Mexican War and the Louisiana 
purchase; and who wants to se nd back the non-WASP 
immigrants . Even as the romantic American 
revolutior aries yearn for the days before the income 
tax, as W. L Webb of the Manchester Guardian puts it: 
"(Solzhen;tsyn) seems to have a soft SPIX for the Tsar ." 
And in a ;ornment reveali ng how naive and unrealistic 
are Solzh:!rlitsyn's views, the New York Times writes : 
"Mr. Solz,enitsyn emerges from his letter as a man who 
considers modern cities to be 'cancerous tumors: who 
would ou tlAw the internal comLustlon <>ngine in favor 
of electri : ifY and go back to the horse and buggy, if 
necessar) ." Solzhenitsyn stands agai nst the universal 
trend of liberating women from their exploited roles as 
servants of men and raisers of fami lies . But it is not only 
women he does not want to liberate Revealing his lack 
of any ~.Iobal social responsibility towards the op-
pressed peoples of the world he wr ites: "(Liberate 
women from) the crowbar and the shovel. To save them 
from this humi liation, who would not abandon the 
subsidization of South American revolutionaries?" 

Who, indeed? 

In fact , Solzh nillyn reveals himself at the sam e time 
to be both not a communist and not a patriot. In his 
letter to the Soviet leaders, he urges them to abandon 

PaRe 4 Triton Times, April S, 1974 

communism, but not to adopt Western style 
"democracy" , which he says is devoid of ethical 
foundation . Instead he reveals himself as a Russian 
aristocratic elitist by urging the dissolution of the 
Soviet Union, the discarding of the fourteen non-
Russian republiCS, and the creation of a Russian 
national state. How could such views be patriotism? 
Were the Columbians who wanted to give up Panama 
patriots? When the south seceded were the 
Southerners patriots of the United States? Of course not. 
And what type of government does this so-<-alled "great 
political thin~er", this " patriot", this "communist", 
advocate? The NYT writes : "For his Russian national 
state, the novelist looks to a vaguely defined 
authoritarian but benevolent system based on the love 
of man ." In fact , Solzhenitsyn wrote : " I invite you and 
everyone who may read this letter to assent to and 
become reconciled to this : Russia is authoritarian, let it 
remain so, and let us no longer try to change that . But 
the authoritarian system must be based on genuine 
concern and love on the part of the rulers ." Some 
examples of such non-communist states based on love 
leap to mind : Spain, Greece, Chile, Brazil, Bolivia, 
Uruguay, Haiti , South Korea, Philippines , South 
Vietnam. 

There are those who would argue that no matter how 
naive Solzhenitsyn may be, no matter how elit ist and 
reactionary he may be, still he was persecuted and his 
"human rights" were violated, as he himself often 
clai ms. But what are "human rights! " They are what 
used to be called "civi l ri ghts" and "ci vil liberties". 
T!'ese latter terms, however, imply that different social 
ystems may have different civil liberties, and that what 
may be acceptable in a bourgeois state may not be 
acceptable in a socia li st state ; and vice-versa . This is 
bad propaganda, howeve r, and so the "civil rights" of 
the U.S. are made "human rights", making them ab-
solute for the universe, and in essense making only a 
bourgeois capitalist system, in its current form, 
"human" . Of course, it is always implicit that Mc-
Carthyism is the exception, not the rule, and that 
capitalism does not inevitably lead to fascism, as in 
Germany and part of latin America and Asia, etc. 
Solzhenitsyn , however, our persecuted dissident and 
c hampion of the American intellectual human liber-
tarians, has strange ideas of human (i .e ., ci,'il) tights: 
The NYT writes that : "Mr. Solzhenitsyn has singlep Cl\lt 
Dr. Daniel Ellsberg as an enemy of his cou51try. He ·~w 
writes of a judge who has acquitted 'a man who, during 
an exhausti ng war, steals and publishes war ministry 
documents .''' Apparently, Dr. Ellsberg could not count 
on the "benevolent" rule of Mr. Solzhenitsyn for the 
safeguarding of hi s "human right" of free speech. 

Why then , if Solzhenitsyn is so naive, backward, and 
e lit ist, (albeit slightly persecuted) do we find so many 
intellec tual s rallying to his defense and even writing 
such blatant propaganda as Jerome Katsell's last article? 
Why do they not look about their own environs for 
"human rights" to protect, for persecuted dissidents 
here in the U. S. to rally around? Need they look farther 
than Ocean Be-ach or Alameda County? How about 
Coachella Valley, Minneapolis, or New York? Where 
were they when Ri chard Nixon and Bobby Kennedy 
were McCarthy's henchmen? Where are they now? 

Obviously, the difference is that Solzhenitsyn is an 
anticommuni st , bourgeois, elitist and so are they . They 
are not against the violation of "human rights", but 
proponents of the maintenance of priviledge. They are 
th comical tools of the ruling class of this country, as 
they have been throughout the cold war. let them find 
people more worthy than Solzhenitsyn of saving, and 
dissent more worthy of not being crushed. 

Poor Jews 
by Be Ve Munchausen 

The main point of this little note is to invite Jack Sage 
to expand on and to document further the following 
points and hunches . 

The Jews were used by the Zionist movement and 
imperialism -( British and American) as a spearhead for 
the colonization of the Middle East. This is well 
documented in "The Tr~nsfonnation of Palestine' by 
Abu-Lughod . British out and Americans in and with 
them, in the meantime, lots of dollars into the Arab 
countries. So much that ""Chase Manhattan economists 
believe that, left unchecked, the Arabs within three 
years would have so much money to invest that the 
world's capital markets could not possibly handle it ." 
And "". of more immediate concern to heads of state is 
whether financial markets will suffer massive disrup-
tions this year if the Arabs decide to pump their oil cash 
immediately into the world economy." 

This is what I want J. S. to elaborate on: The Jews are 
being pushed back into their original boundaries ; will 
they be pushed out of Palestine because imperialism is 
aligning itself with the Arabs, or rather with the Arab 
money? Think on the two quotes and guess on whose 
side U. S. economic elites will be. Another wild 
oossibility is that the U. S. decided to wcr;te some 
billions of taxpayers' money in order to have the Arabs 
waste some billions in armaments; there you have an 
explanation for the Middle East recent war-and the next 
ones. (The U. S. shipped several billions in arms to Israel 
that she will pay for; who knows how?) . And what 
about the oil embargo? It may have been a fal se 
political bargaining chip~ especially if one considers 
who is getting profits from it. And what do you make 
out of this : " ". what worries some western officials 
(which ones?) is that an excess of petrodollars may be 
finding their way into the arms and capital markets and 
tipping the balance of power in other areas of the 
world." Certainly it doesn ' t refer to the U.S.S.R. whi ch 
has become powerful much to the disgust of some 
creeps (l'ound here. China or Europe? Probably. It may 
also refer to the countries in Africa which are kick ing 
imperialism out bit by bit . All the quotes come from an 
article by R. l. Soble which appeared in the lA Times 
24th of last Feb., which ends in a most noisome way : 
"American investment bankers who have visted Arab 
leaders latel y bel ieve (good that they do) the worst 
mistake Westerners can make is to think that the Arabs 
are sitting in a desert marketplace weaving rugs without 
any idea what international finance is all about." This 
means that that's what they thought when they went 
there . (If you are unable to relate the title to the text, 
then a university is the place tor yOU) .

"SLA·~IA?" ? 
by Murdoch Mallako 

QiI.wling Eye raised an interesting point in an article 
published in North Star, but he makes a bad case out of 
it Sheer consistency with this crazy country would 
suggest that possibility . It is true that after Patty is 
released we may witness a wave of repression against 
the groups in the left, plus a campaign of brainwashing 
to polarize people towards the right. I ask myself, why 
doesn't Crawling Eye also take the opportunity to 
educate the readers of campus papers on the corporated 
control of the media, of how Randolph Hearst is in a lot 
of things? He is a member of the ruling elites even 
though he may not be a Rockefeller . This will clarify his 
fi rst point . As to his second point, is there a way to know 
for sure if the Black liberation Army really exists or not? 
Why doesn't he point that out. I don't think the SlA is 
giv ing away any groups by greeting them . Probablr 
Crawling Eye has a file already with the ~ BI. How can we 
verify the third point? And with regard to his No. 4, we 
can refer him to the movie "The Battle of Algiers" where 
they make a plausible sketch of how a secret un-
derground guerilla group is to be organized. The less 
each of the members know about the rest, the better. 
His points five and six make some sense taking into 
account what I mention at the beginning. In this place 
one shall always expect something bizarre to happen . In 
the seventh point, Saxbe may have been referring to the 
identities of the members of the SLA . But on-e never 
knows. Did you read the second communique with the 
SLA's reply to Saxbe's statemenH What about point 
eight? Well, who knew the Tupamaros or the ERP before 
they went into action. With respect to point nine, I ask 
him : would you come out and say that you support SLA? 
Support to $lA shall be pledged only by underground 
groups if there is no chance of their giving away 
themselves or the $lA. We all agree that things in this 
case are very strange and we should be attentive and 
prepared for anything that may c~me up. 

Anyway .. . 

Letters to the Editor 
April Fool . 

Editor, 
The Triton Times has hit 

an unbelievable new low in 
journalism . I refer 
specifically, though not 
exclUSively, to the article 
"Work on Third Starts" in 
the April 2, 1974 issue of the 
Triton Times. 

The article in question 
reeks of racial slurs and 
ridicules . Whether this 
e ffect was intended is 
immaterial; the results will 
be the same . The article can 
serve only to increase racial 
tension at UCSD. 

I condemn the article 
"Work on Third Starts," and 
similar articles such as 
" Shockley Appointed 
Provost at Third" and 
"University Fills Quota" as 
stupid and irresponsible 
journalism . I demand a full 
retraction of such articles 
and a public apology to the 
entire UCSD community for 

such assault on good taste 
and intelligence. 

Nicholas Papadopoulos 

Harmful 
Editor-
I would like to comment 

on your recent edition of 
the Triton Times and its 
disappointing content. I 
detect that others as well as 
myself are ashamed to have 
this "newspaper" as the 
official campus 
publication . 

With regards to your 
articles "Shockley Ap-
pointed Provost at Third", 
'Work on Third Starts", and 
the entire back page, it is 
possible to see damaging 
implications for the campus 
community. These type of 
articles are barmfyl in that 
they separate the university 
into even more distinct 
factions, d isu niting futher

that which was never "one" 
to begin with . I rather think 
that the opposite should be 
aimed for, April fools day or 
not, but evidently the 
Triton Times does oot share 
the same opinion . 

For many, war has been 
easier than wisdom and 
courage; likewise for the 
Triton Times, it has been 
easier to thoughtlessly 
satirize than to con -
structively criticize . A 
med i a shou Id help to 
com municate , not 
dissociate ; it should seek to 
improve with constryctjye 
crit icis m , not alienate with 
ambiguous undiscerning 
garbage. Granted, a good 
laugh ca n come from 
reading somethi ng absurd . 
"Abnormalty " a nd the 
" unord in ary" generally 
seem to generate th is 
reaction . But when does 
sati re cease to be satire? 
When has prejudice ever 
been a joking matter? Those 
affected as well as myself 
certainly don't look at it as 
being very funny . 

It is also unfortunate that 
this heedless inanity un-
dermines other worthYrbjle 
questions that desperately 
need consideration : 
inadequate undergraduate 
education, inadequate 
student government, a 
disunited university 
community, and lack of 
participation by students in 
policy making-to name a 
few. 

Yes, one can read in the 
Triton Times about 
Shockley's theory of genetic 
inferiorities and about the 
inferior cafeteria food . But 
it is quite easy to see that a 
larger inadequacy exists in 
the campus newspaper 
itself . April fools lasts not 
for three quarters but for 
one day, and when one 
really thinks about it , who's 
fooling who? 

Ron Bee 

Feces 
Editor, 
To whonl ever wrote the 

articles, " Shockly Ap-
pointed Provost at Third 
College", 'Work on Third 
Starts", and "University Fills 
Quota". You have just 
contributed to the feces 

that Triton Times prints 
Were these articles sup-
posed to be April Fools 
jokes? 

Triton Ti..,es, you have 
tried to descredit Third 
coll.ege in every way 
possible, but this is the low 
of your existence. lets 
review your past. First the 
degrading article sup-
posedly written by a Black 
woman concering the Black 
Man 's sexual ability, then 
the artic Ie about rude 
Blacks, and other tasteless 
articles you have printed 
that continue to lower the 
image of Third ColielZe. 

These articles were really 
screwed up! April fools , 
feces of the male ox! Their 
were three articles about 
Third, and one concerning 
Revelle , and what about 
Muir? But those do not 
com pare to the ones written 
about Third (referring to the 
article about Revelle) . Not 
only did you print those 
articles, but you had to add 
insult to insult by printing 
the picure representing 
slaves building Third 
College . This was really 
sickening. You wonder why 
things happen on this 
campus? It is because your 
newspaper a~ravatesit by 
printing feces, top Grade A 
white processed feces . Your 
editor and the yellow 
journalism in this paper is 
full of feces . I think the 
newspaper (Triton Times) 
commonly referred to as 
Triton Trash, should print 
an apology to the students 
and faculty of Third College 
for all the trash you have 
printed in the past as well a.s 
the ones you so stupidly 
printed in your April issue. 
The people of Third College 
are tired of the continuous 
assault and personal 
defamation of the charcter 
of this college and its 
students . We need a new. 
editor of the Triton Times 
because the present editor 
cannot control the output 
of his newspaper , which is 
his job to edit. 

The people who wrote 
those articles, should never 
touch a pen again as long as 
they live. Your degrading 
and stereotyped view of 
Third College,. reflects your

For some time now the 
Triton Times has been 
devoting considerable 
editorial space to attacks on 
President Nixon. Although 
the events of the last yeil/' or 
so have certainly provided 
ample justification for such 
attacks, I think that an 
impartial analysis will show 
th.at further dumping on Mr. 
Nixon at this point is simply 
a waste of effort . 

First of all, it is un-
necessary. Judging by the 
results of recent public 
opinion surveys, and 
allowing for the usual 
liberal Deomocratic in-
clination of a college 
community, I would 
estimate that 90 percent of 
the people on this campus 
bel ieve that President 
Nixon is unfit for office. It 
should be clear to most 
people by now that Mr. 
Nixon is, at best, a very 
poor judge of character; at 
worst, he is a crook. So, why 
keep on telling people what 
they already know? 

Secondly, it is futile . 
President Nixon is firmly 
entrenched and determined 
to hold onto his office just 
as long as he possibly can . 
He will not resign if in-
dicted; he will not resign if 
impeached; and I am not 
even sure he would leave 
office if convicted by 
Congress . I would not put it 
past him to attempt this 
country's first coup d'etat. 
At any rate, the question is 
nearly academic because, 
barring another maior 
scandal, the chances of an 
impeachment - against 
President Nixon ever 

coming abo",t are now 
almost nil. In matters of this 
sort one must strike while 
the scandal is hot. The 
moment has passed, and 
time is now on Mr. Nixon's 
side. 

So, we may as well face 
it : we are probably stuck for 
Three More Years. In the 
meanwhile, we should tum 
our efforts toward doing 
something constructive, 
such as seating a few 
members of Congress who 
are committed to returning 
some of the power and 
initiative of the Federal 
government to the 
legislative branch.

"Ascent of Man" 

Professor Joseph Kraut of 
the Chemistry Department 
has secured a grant from 
the National Endowment 
for the Humanities for the 
presentation of the film 
series " The Ascent of Man". 
The series of th irteen 
outstanding films , co-
produced by Time-Life 
Films and the B.B.C., 
presents the ideas of Dr. 
Jacob Bronowski, eminent 
philosopher, mathemati-
cian, and Senior Fellow at 
the Salk Institute. 

The first two segments 
"Lower Than Angels': and 
"The Harvest of the 
Seasons", will be presented 
Monday, April 8th in USB-
2722 at 7:30 p.m .The 
remaining films in the series 
wi II be presented on 
consecutive Monday nights 
in USB-2722 at the same 
time. 

In th is series, Dr. 
Bronowski traces and 
explores Man's complex 
and often precarious ascent 
of his earliest form and 
abilities . Included are 
segments dealing with 
mystical searchings leading 
to the beginnings of 
chemistry, an outline of the 
development of music , 
cosmblogy, relativity , 
evolution, physi cs and the 
dilemma of scientific 
morality . 

The Chemistry Depart-
ment and the Campus 
Program Board are pleased 
to be able to present this 
important series without 
charge.

Children's Theatre Players 
Spring production "The 
Prince Who Wouldn't 
Grow" wi II be held Saturday 
afternoon, April 6, ift 201 
Me (next to the bookstore) 
at 1:00 p.m. 

Eleven parts ire available 
in this clownish comedy 
dealing with a kingdom's 
solutions to the prob lem of 
a prince who just won't 
grow. Various members of 
the social strata attempt to 
solve this perplexing 
problem including a prime 
minister, a bumbling 
magician, a quack doctor, a 
misinformed school 
teacher, and a military 
general. 

"The play lends itself 
quite readily to a sort of 
stylized Commedia 
del'Arte/Circus Clown type 
presentation" says Director 
Larry Deckel. "It will be 
brightly costumed, with an 
outlook towards broad, 
broad playing, with huge 
props, and a sense of 
buffonery." The Show is 
being built to travel easily 
and tentative plans include 
outdoor performances in 
parks and .so forth ." 

The play has an appeal to 
children at all age levels, 
and the production will 
offer UCSD students a rare 
opportunity to work with a 
child audience. Production 
dates are scheduled the 
week of May 11 through 19. 

Auditions are completely 
open to the UCSD com-
munity, and new-comers 
are encouraged to attend. 
Positions are also available 
for those interested in 
technical work in all fields.

Records: Musical N 
Unborn Child - Seals Mel Crofts 

Warner BIOS. 
Hurrah. Seals and Crofts have 

wound up back on the ground 
iIIain . After the success of 
"Summer Breeze", the dyanmic 
duo seemed to have vision~ of 
superstardom in the heads, and 
"Diamond Girl" seemed 50 
pushy, so trying to be. 

With "Unborn Child" Seals 
and Crofts have relax~ back 
into their music, and even layed 
back for what seems to be their 
most ballady album yet. This is 
not in any way meant to say the 
album is fluffy, but rather, that 
it has a relaxed poetic air to it, 
which negates a more rocky 
tendancy that some of their 
earlier work seemed to be 
possibly headed for . 

Seals and Croft continue to 
blend their vocal harmonies 
intrinSically with the guitar/-
mandolin riffs to their best 
advantage. Working from both 
ends, the guitars following 
vocals in "Big Mac", and the 
vocals chasing neatly along the 
lines of the guitar riff in the 
album's best cut "Dance by the 
light of the Moon." 

Th~ album is slightly marred 
with a bit of poetic drivel, in 
which recitation is placed 
against instrumental (which just 
doesn't seem to work anywhere 
today no matter how well-
intentioned it may be) and the 
sociological implications of title 
cut "Unbord Child" are liable to 
insult some liberated souls with 
its anti-abortion sentiments, but 
all in all, the album remains a 
pleasant, melodic distraction in 
the midst of all the oppressive 
pop music of today.

Rock n Roll Animill - Lou Reed 

RCA 
Well nobody seems abre to 

catch Lou Reed getting into a 
rut. From "Velvet Un-
derground," to "Transformer," 
to his epic Berlin, lou Reed now 
takes yet another turn and 
becomes a "Rock n Roll 
Animal." And the attack is with 
more vengence that the Velvet 
Underground ever had. 

What makes this album so 
good is that Reed has got just an 
incredible band playing for him . 
Steve Hunter' s intro and 
prologue to Reed's entrance and 
"Sweet Jane" is just as fluid and 
crisp as e lectri c guitars can get. 

The album is just in no way 
apologetic . It's direct dynamic 
rock 'n roll, with lou Reed at the 
front of it all.lt's not that he's 
got such a hot voice, but it's an 
album that just reeks with 
charisma.The builds and ex-
tensions herein, particuliarly on 
" Heroin" make this as excitin~ a 
gut rock album as has been seen 
in a while. 

The Giant Rilt of 
Firesian The ... ,. 

Well, the Firesign

temporary split which 
claimed never happened 

~ed to hurt them a . 
latest offering is 
most commercial 
date. Unlike past firesign 
the Giant Rat offers a 
linear story line to follow 
the majority of their 
always transversed. It 
reminiscent of the Nick 
sequence of long ago, in 
a simple story receives their 
than simple treatment. 

Here it's Hemlock 
Great Defective, and his 
companion and biographer 
Flotsom who romp their 
through the typical blend 
Firesign humor. Heavy on 
most sophisticated puns 
found, this album is the 
accessible one they've 
produced. The humour is 
the same, with gems like 
without your clothes 
naked Miss Dudley" or 
the mouth on that 
but the plot is 
simpler and lacks 
the disappointment 
Firesign fans) the 
variations and levels that 
previously seen . 

For pure humour sake 
solid as anything they've 
and should even make

that for Sherlock Holmes 
it's a must, the in-jokes

Concert Notes: "The Band That Drove, fhe 
. Rats Out of Munford 

If you're a rock and roll 
fan, then, Tuesday the 9th 
will be your night to rock 
out and party ... the UCSD 
Campus Program Board and 
KSDT are presenting a rock 
and roll show you'll never 
forget. Stomp in' into the 
Gym for the evening will be 
the Don Nix-larry Rasp-
berry and the Highsteppers 
Review. 

The band, numbering 13 
or so in membership, is a 
blending of numerous 
musical styles and 
backgrounds, including 
Mississippi! delta blues, 
Braodway musicals, and 
down-home Memphis style 
rock. 

The "Cast of Characters" 
includes the near-legendary 
Don Nix. Nix has long been 
a vaguely familiar figure 
lurking on the edges of the 
music world. Heavily in-
fluenced by bluesmen such 
as Furry lewis, and Sleepy 
John Estes, Nix has worked 
as a singer, producer, 
composer and musician. 

As a singer-musician , Nix 
was an origianl member of 
the classic Memphis group 
The Mar-Keys (with Steve 
Cropper, Duck Dunn and 
Wayne Jackson); a par-
tici pant in the Concert for 
Bangladesh ; and a member 
of the Alabama State 
Troupers road show a few 
years back . Nix is also the 
composer of " Goin' Down" 
which has been recorded at 
least twenty-one times. As a 
producer, Nix, has 
produced albums for John 
Mayall, Jeff Beck, Delaney 
and Bonnie (who he 
discovered), Albert King, 
Freddie King, Charlie 
Musselwhite, to name a 

gen'l admission 12.50 
UCSD students '1.50 

few . His latest album 
"Hobos, Heros, and Street 
Corner Clowns" is a 
collection of songs mostly 
based on personal ex-
periences. 

Toe-tappin' music is a 
mainstay of the current 
music scene. With Nix, will 
be larry Raspberry and 
Highsteppers, an in-

Don Nix 

credible combination of 
an ex-a irline stewardess, a 
members of a OO's popular 
band (The GentrysJ, 
Broadway musIcians ... in 
short, a group of rock and 
roll stampers . larry 
Raspberry, described as the 
"Master of Ceremonies", 
the H ighsteppers' founder, 
lead singer, guitarist, pianist 
and "resident Mouth" has 
been around the music 
scene for quite some time-
including stints with the 
Gentrys (of "Keep on 
Dancing" fame) and with 
Alamo, another Memphis 
group. 

C:arol Sue Ferrante, a 
former Miss Tennessee and 
airline stewardess jOined 
the Highsteppers band in 
1972. The rhythm iC section 
of th e Highsteppers is 
com pri sed of Rocky 
Barretta and Bill Marshall 
who have played together 
for seven years and have 
made appearances with Z. 
Z. Top and Joe Walsh prior 
to joining larry . Greg 
" Fingers" Taylor, th e 
harmonica player, has 
worked with Jimmy Buf-
fette. And round ing out the 
I: ~nd , are the two most 
recent enl is t ees -Jerr y 
McKinney and Joe 
Mulherin-making up the 
"horn" sect ion . 

With the people men-
tioned above and t he 
addition of many others to 
the current tour, the Don 
Ni)(-larry Raspberry and the 
Highsteppers Review has 
been tearing apart the 
country. The varied in-
dividual talents, combined 
into a single dynamic force 
promises one o f the most 
exc iting and fun shows ever 
to come to the UCSD 
campus. 

So, come join the fun 
with "The Band That Drove 
the Rats Out of Munford", 
Tuesday night, April 9th at 8 
pm in the UCSD gym . 
Tickets are ONLY S1.50 for

Spring Has Sprung 

III UNTITLED I 

The Staff trusts that 
everyone of you lan-
dlubbers had a great 
vacation. It sure is a 
touching gesture of the 
Regents to allow the 
student a whole entire week 
in which to vacation (Praise 
the LordI) In any case, the 
UT staff could go on for 
pages about the madcap 
misadventures of Chet and 
Shawnovich as they suc-
cessfully endeavored to 
compress 6 months of 
enjoyment, drinking, and 
carousing around into one 

week of hard living . 
Besides, old Eric has a low 
tolerance level (were not 
speaking of beer here, but 
don't tell hIm I sa,d so, he 
has a very low tolerance 
level there also) about what 
goes on in his hallowed 
sports page. 

Spring quarter is a unique 
experience here at UCSD . 
The staff has decided to 
drop a few hints on how to 
set yours up. Too many 
freshmen are new here and 
have yet to experience their 
first spring la Jolla sen-
satiom (especially fresh-
men from such God-
forsaken places as China 

lake, Chino, Davis, Chico: 
tresno, gosh, I can't go on). 
Alas, too many others have 
forgotten what spring 
quarter should really be 
like. The UT staff is pushing 
for the eradication of the 
all-too-common lament 
"Sure, I go to UCSD, sure 
it's in la Jolla, very close to 
the beach . You know how 
many times I've been down 
to the beach meathead???? 
Once, all year I've been 
down there just on-
ce ... sob ... sobl" listen here 
you bozos, this kind of 
attitude has got to stop. 

Ergo, the first step for 
spring is to take a light 

Tritons Beat Selves; 
Lose to USD Nine 

The ambitious sport-
swriter, in his drive to be 
the next Jim Murray, must 
learn several things in order 
to become a great jour-
nalist. He must learn to 
write. He must have a 
general, if not in depth, 
knowledge of most sports. 
And finally he must be able 
to find the stadium or arena 
in which a given sports 
event is to take place. 

In the course of covering 
the UCSD Baseball team 
the latter requirement 
might be a stumbling block 
to the budding sportswriter. 
Or so I found out when I 
was assigned to do this 
story on the baseball team . 

The game itself, played 
on Tuesday, was a disap-
pointment as the Tritons 
dropped a tough game to 
the University of San Diego 
by the score of 5-2. It was a 
game that could have gone 
either way, but went the 
way of USD on a couple of 
defensive lapses on the part 
of the Tritons. 

and the second one was 
scored on a wild pitch after 
two men were out. 

I n the bottom of the third 
the Tritons tied the score 
with two runs of their own. 
They loaded the bases, then 
Curt Jenkins worked the 
pitcher for a walk to force 
in one run . Bill Goddard 
drove in the other run while 
grounding in to a double 
play. 

The last three USD runs 
were also unearned. In the 
sixth inning the Toreros 
loaded the bases with two 
buts . The hitter then 
popped up in foul territory, 
only to get a reprieve at the 
plate when third baseman 
Jeff Simon collided with 
catcher Randy Sena, the 
ball falling untouched. In 
the ninth inning USD got 
another unearned run as a 
man tripled then scored on 
an error at first with two 
outs . 

pitch was not allowed to go 
to first and another runner 
was called . out after Jeff 
Simon was called for 
running out of the base 
path, this call completing a 
double play. 

On the season the Tritons 
are 5-9 but playing well 
according to coach lyle 
Olsen. Olsen said that the 
main problem with the 
team is a definite lack of 
scoring. He said that the 
pitching was excellent and 
has kept them in most of 
their games. 

Olsen also said that the 
team has no real stars, the 
team plays well together, 
with different players taking 
tums in having excellent 
days . 

The pitching staff is 
composed of Peter Yockey, 
Randy Miller, Bob 
loutgren, Jeff Wiederholt, 
and Mark Farrar. All five 
have pitched well this year 
but have lost a little of their 
touch over the finals and 
spring break layoff . As the 
team gets back into the 
groove you can look for-
ward to some exciting 

schedule . There are a 
couple of ways to do this 
but the UT staff is con-
vinced that everyone, even 
the freshmen have adroit 
methods of getting around 
the system . A few simple 
suggestions might be in 
order though for the more 
naiveandinnocentthinking. 
The simplest road to 
freedom is to take 8, 12, or 
14 units, Another . 

possibility for the vast 
majority of Revelle 
Students (some Muir, some 
Third) that have a com-
pulsive urge to take at.Jeast 
18 units, if not 22 or 24, is to 
assimilate some less 
demanding classes into 
your schedule, perhaps 
Fingerpainting l-A or 
Basketweaving 121 . There 
are a plethora of creative 
thinkers out there who can 
initiate separate methods 
(One mentioned to me is to 
sign up for 20 units and 
then take 'F's in two of the 
classes-what a brave and 
courqeous individuall) 

Now that you have your 
12 units, the next step is go 
out and have some fun, and 
the prospects lOok &ood 
already. Mother Nature is 
out trying to figure out the 
difference between butter 
and margarine while Father 
Nature is getting hish on 
something, leaving La jolla 
to take care of itself with 
some nice sand and sun . 

But, besides the beach 
there's old Lee Johnson and 
his troops doing their thing . 
Taking a look at the lineup 
for spring, why you just 
gotta get on a softball team 
and what's this I hear about 
hockey in the gym? What 
will they think of next? 

So, spring quarter is here 
and its about time people 
started acting like they go 
to school by the beach. We 
suggest a light load with 
heavy emphasis on sun, 
sand, and surf and get that 
tan so you can go home and 
impress your friends . 

The game started slowly, 
with the pitchers keeping 
the hitters in check for the 
first two innings. In the top 
of the third USD erupted for 
two runs, the first earned 

The Tritons attempted to 
make the Kctme exciting in 
the bottom of the ninth, but 
their rally was snuffed by 
some timely and somewhat 
indecisive calls by the 
umpires . The Tritons loaded 
the bases with no one out 
but were unable to score a~ 
one batter who was hit by a

Good Guys Lose Two 
In Volleyball Happening 

by Eric Ra isters 

Unknown to most UCSD 
students, although quite 
well publicized in the San 
Diego commu nity , The 
United States Volleyball 
Association sponsored one 
of the top women 's 
volleyball teams in the ' 
world to play one of the top 
amateur women's teams in 
the U. S., the LA Renegades, 
before a highly volleyball-
oriented San Diego' Crowd . 

The feature game was 
prece jed by a warm-up 
game featuring the Old 
Mission Beach Athletic 
Club (OMBAC) and none 
other than our own UCSD 
Voilleyball Team . Although 
in an earlier meeting this 
year, OMBAC had bested 
the Triton spikers in four 
sets, they were in for a fight 
this time. 

In the first game, UCSD 
led by Bruce Cazden and 
Tim Myrick's hitting kept 
OMBAC within two points 
throughout the whole 
game. Then, disaster struck 
as UCSD blew two passes, 
their usual mode of losing 
games, and lost a close one 
15-13. 

I n the second game 
UCSD overpowered 
OMBAC, despite the Tritons 
acute lack of height (the 

tallest player on the team is 
Tim Myrick , who is 6'3") 15-
10. 

In the deciding game, the 
Tri tons passing again fell 
apart as they were not able 
to manage any sort of 
offense against the height 
of the OMBAC players. 
Final score was 15-10. 

The feature game was a 

tough three out of five 
battle between the Korean 
National Women's team 
and the LA Renegades, 
beefed up with a variety of 
U.S ., OlympiC stars such as 
30 year old Nancy Owens 
and San Diego State's own 
Laurel Brassie. 

For those who are not 
that familiar with national 
volleyball, Ms. Brassie is the 
first woman ever to play, 
and is in fact one of the 
starting setters for, San 
Diego State's I n-
tercollegiate Volleyball 
Team . 

The Korean women 
showed why they were an 
international and Olympic 
caliber team as they handily 
disposed of the Renegades, 
15-11, 15-8, 15-2. Although 
the victories were not qu ite 
as easy as the scores reflect, 
the Korean women kept 
their cool and were able to 
pull both of the close games 
out before they were really 
pressed . 

Although the UCSD 
crowd was sparse, probab ly 
because of the high prtce of 
adm ission, the crowd was 
nonetheless large , and 
highly partisan 

With a warm-up USVBA 
tournament coming up thiS 
weekend, the Tritons will be 
able to tryout some new 
tricks after the week long 
layoff for vacation, before 
resuming Single matches 
against UC Riverside . April 
12, and San Bernardino 
Valley JC, April 19. Both 
matche will be held on the 
home court.

Another Russian Threat 
WASHINGTON - "A truly massive effort" in Soviet missile development will soon 

pose a dirKt threat to the U S. landbased missile force, says Defense Secretary James 
R. Schlesinger. 

Relore the end of the decade. Schlesinger said, the 1,000 Minuteman missiles ready 
tor launch in underground si los will be threatened by an increasingly accurate and 
growing torce of Russian missi les 

The defense secretary set out his fears in a 237-page annual stateme nt , detailing 
US. mil itary goa ls over the next few years . 

The state key to Sc hlesigner 's worries is four new Russian missiles designed to carry 
between tour and ix highly accurate warheads, each capable of being aimed at 
separate targets . 

While an advantage In mi ssile payload or destructive throw-weight has been 
concE'clecl to the Soviets, relat ive equality has been achieve because the United States 
has had separatelv targetaQle missiles (MIRVs) fo r more than five yea rs 

"Th. thro\\-\\ eigllt. combined with increased accuracy a nd MIR Vs could give the 
o \let s on the order of 7.000 one-to-two megaton warheads in their ICBM force 

alone." the defense secretary said 
Pentagon offi Cials ay the Russians are expected to begin plaCing MIRTV missiles in 

their arsenal sometime during 1975, with most of the older missile force replaced by 
about 1980 

UCR Prof Receives USSR Science Honor 

RIVERSIDE-A University of 
California, Riverside professor has 
recentlv become the third American 
scientist in history to be elected an 
Honorary Foreign Member of the En-
tomological 'Society of the Union of 
Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). 

Selected for this unique scientific 
honor was Dr. Paul DeBach, professor of 
biological control at UCR and associate 
director of the International Center for 
Biological Control-located on the 
Riverside and Berkeley campuses of the 
University of California. He is one of the 
world's foremost authorities in biological 
control, the science of controlling insect 
pests by using other insects which are 
natural enemies of the pests. 

The other American scientists so 
honored in the past were Dr. Curtis W . 
Sabrosky, director of the U. S. 
Agriculture Department's Systematic 
Entomology laboratory in Washington, 
D.C., and the late Dr. E. A. Steinhaus 
professor of pathobiology and director of 
the Center for Pathobiology at UC Irvine. 

Commenting on his election, De Bach 
said , " I was both surprised and extremely 

pleased . I feel very strongly that 
scientists of all nations need to 
cooperate as fully as possible to try to 
improve man's life on this planet." 

An internationally recoanized expert 
in his specialty, he has, ewer last 30 years, 
introduced to the U.S. more than 40 
beneficial insects that did not exist here 
previously. 

Editor of t~ classic work in his field 
Biological Control of Insect Pest and 
Weeds-which in 1968 was translated 
into Russian-DeBach has visited vir-
tually every major country in the world 
during the cOl.lrse of his work. 

DeBach believes that control of pests 
by their natural enemies is superior to 
controls by insecticides, which can often 
cause envirorvnental harm. "The natural 
predators we collect ," he explained, "are 
carefully screened so that they attack 
only harmful insects and do not ad-
versely affect the environment in other 
ways." 

DeBach's work is generally credited 
with saving millions of dollars to farmers 
in this country and abroad . 

Virus Hunt Under Heavy SeCurity 

lOS ANGELES-In an unusual' new 
laboratory at the UCLA School of 
Medicine secured by elaborate airlocks 
and mantles of sterile air, human cells 
including cancerous ones that may 
harbor hazardous viruses, are being 
cultivated and probed. 

Th is is the Human Cell Containment 
laboratory of the division of surgical 
oncology. Scientists are studying these 
human cells to determine the process by 
which such cells are malignantly tran-
sformed . A special thrust of the 
Laboratory is in pursuit of the elusive 
human cancer virus, which many believe 
exists , and has a key role in this tran-
sformation. 

This thrust is the basis of the elaborate 
security measures installed in the 
laboratory . The system of airlocks, areas 
of, negative pressure and hooded 
laboratory work benches, draped with 
(laminar-flow) curtains of sterile, filtered 
air, are desillned not only to safeguard 
laboratory workers but to prevent 
contamination of the tumor tissue with 
outside viruses, Dr. Donald Morton, chief 
of the surgical oncology division.,POints 
out. 

Since viruses are prime suspects as a 
cause of cancer, they must be considered 
a risk to persons working with the tumor 
tissue. he says. And on the other hand, 
virus contamination of the tissue could 
cause confounding, if not embarrassing 
experimental results . 

The Human Cell Containment 
laboratory is entered through a double 
air-lock system into an intermediate or 
"clean area ." Office and laboratory space 
of minimal conta inment is located here. 
Through another set of airlocked doors is 
a "red area" th'it is under "negative 
pressure." There W ;)I kers must don steri Ie

tum, a highly contained human tumor 
't.!.ssue culture area. There, also, in the 
"red area," laboratory materials are 
decontaminated . 

To date no one has positively iden-
tified a human cancer virus, though 
human warts, which are benign tumors, 
are caused by a papilloma virus, points 
out Dr. Wendell Winters, who heads one 
of the laboratory research teams. Virus- · 
like particles' have been observed in 
about three percent of the human solid 
tumor material examined in the 
laboratory. There is no evidence to show 
whether they are involved in malignant 
transformation or merely stowaways in a 
cell unrelated to the cancer process. 

The research team has _ developed a 
laboratory model of malignant tran-
sformation of human cells. When first 
cultured in the laboratory, skeletal or soft 
tissue tumors exhibit long spindle-shaped 
cells . After a time the cells begin to 
change, becoming more compact, 
proliferating more rapidly and piling up 
in clumps-a malignant transformation . 
OccaSionally virus-like particles similar 
to thos~ seen in the original tumors, 
appear In the cellular clumps. 

A number of viruses have been 
associated with human cancers. These 
include herpes viruses, which are im-
plicated in such infections as cold sores, 
genital disorders and mononucleosis .. 
But none has been shown to be the 
actual cause of cancer. A definite ·link 
between animal viruses and animal 
cancer has been established and some of 
the human viruses can induce cancer in 
experimental animals . What this all 
means in terms of human cancer may 
eventually emerge from concentrated 
research eHorts such as those in the 
Human Cell Containment laboratory at 
UCLA. 

ARCHITECTS' RENDERING OF NEW Sl.7-MILLION MARINE BIOLOGY BUILDING ilt

Shuttle Boom Blah 
CAPE CAt>. , VERAl (UPI) 

- As space travel moves 
from the discovery era to 
the "bus driving" decade, 
the Kennedy Space Center 
will advance from boom-
and-bust to stable em-
ployement. 

That's the prediction of 
John I . Neilan, director of 
unmanned launch 
oPerations at the center . 

He expects no repetition 
of the alternating periods of 
frantic recruiting and 
massive layoHs which were 
the pattern of the 1960's, as 
the center's space shuttle 
development and in-
creasing unmanned satellite 
launchings take over from 
the gl amour missions of the 
Apollo and Skylab projects . 

"The whole concept of 
the shuttle is different. The 
whole premise of making it 
work is unheroic. It's sort of 
like driving a bus," Neilan 
said in an interview. 

. Construction of a 15,()()(). 
foot runway for the orbiting 
Si>ace shuttle landings is to 
begin this month . And 
contracts have been let for 
the two solid-fuel booster 
rockets which will be 
strapped to the shuttle's 
main engine to blast it into 
low orbit. 

scientific instruments into 
orbit. 

"If there is any sense in 
having a (manned) space 
program ... the shuttle is the 
only way to go," Cray said . 
''We don't have anything 
else for manned launches 
except the Apollo hard-
ware . It's (the Apollo 
equipment) very costly, it's 
not reusable, it's money 
down the drain." 

Gray said the shuttle is 
"reusable and it's intended 
to be cheap." 

. CURE "TERM PAPER FRIGHT" 

Although some critics 
have called the project an 
expensive folly, Robert 
Gray, manager of the 
shuttle program, said he 
thinks the project will more 
than pay for itself. He said 
the major parts can be used 
over again for up to 40 
space shuttle flights a year, 
each capable of carrying as 
much as 26,000 pounds of

"What, Lord?" 
"Wayne Newton, " the Lord ~aid smugly . 
Moses shook hi s head in bewilderment. 
"Don't worry, Moses. Soon enough you' ll know him 

too well. A few days of this guy and even I couldn 't 
convice Deep Heet to keep you ," He slammed the book 
shut and Atlantis fell into the ~ea . "Just tell the Hebrews 
to stuff virgin lamb's wool into their ears and they'll be 
safe. Also, get ready to leave . Now, go ." 

Moses said, "Hokay, boss," and left the lord alone on 
the peak of Mt . Aerowax, saying something about 
saving Newton for another age. 

Briefly put, here's what haDoened . Waynl 
Newton camt', saw, and disgusted millions. Those who 
heard him despaired of life and committed suicide . 
Those who merly saw him had to be content with losi ng 

t~eir last meal. 
By the end of the first day of Newton . Egypt was 

brougpt to her knees . This time Pharaoh donned a 
yermulka and visited Moses. 

"Take the Hebrews-please l " he pleaded . 
The people of Israel were divided by tribes ; Levi , 

farah, I3enjamin , Franklin, Zebulon, Pike, etc ., and 
loaded on the five-thirteen express to the Wet Sea . 

Meanwhile, back at the ranch , Deep Heet was having 
sKond thoughts . He wrestled with his conscience that 
moming and after getting it in a full nelson. dKided he 
wanted the Hebrews back . Quickly, he got the army 
together. 

"Quickly ," he yelled to his vizier, "get the army 
together!" 

As luck would have it, the five-thirteen lost both 
hamsters and the Hebrews had to hoof it. They were just 
a mile or so from the shores of the We t Sea when 
someone spotted a dust cloud in the west-in the 
direction of Me mphis . Moses quickly realized it was 
caused by Pharaoh's troops . 

"Uh-oh ," he grimaced , "someone counted the 
ilverware" He whipped the four a se pulling his cart 

to hurry them O ne of th m got fed up and went 10 find
