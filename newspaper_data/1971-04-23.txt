UC Students Run Sacramento 
Office T 0 Lobby Legislature 

John laller 
Staff Writer 

"It's the unglorious, non-headline-making 
work that really affects the issues," declares 
Richard Twohy, "and that's what I'm all 
about." 

A soft-spoken but persistent easterner 
sporting neatly trimmed side burns and a 
mustache, Richard Twohy is the first full-time 
student lobbyist in the country. He works for the 
Associated Students of the University of 
California, under the direction of the UC 
Council of Student Body Presidents. "My job," 
he says, " is to work for things the students 
want." 

A 26-year-old law graduate from New York 
University, Twohy will meet the Sacramento 
legislators on their own ground. Paying careful 
attention to technicalities and loopholes that are 
often 90 per cent of the substance of a 
prospective law, Twohy is preparing positions 
on twelve bills, currently pending before the 
legislature, that will affect students of the 
University. He makes no decisions for himself, 
however, but acts only at the direction of the 
council of UC presidents. 

Two Billsutroduced 
But beyond merely taking positions on 

already-existing bills, Twohy has managed to 
have two of his own bills introduced. Both would 
increase the University's and the state's 
commitment to the Educational Opportunity 
Program. If they pass, the UC EOP program 
would get a $6 million shot in the arm for its 
existing $8 millio . program. The revenue bill 
was introduced by Hon. William Bagley, the 
prominent Republican who was instrumental in 
pushing through Governor Reagan's tax reform 
last session. Twohy has . also lined up the 
Democratic floor leader in the Assembly, 
Walter Karabian, as co-sponsor of the bill . 

With such bipartisan support, Twohy may be 
well on his way toward an important 
achievement. Asked how he persuaded a 
Reagan Republican to support an EOP 
increase, he replied , "Just lucky, I guess. You 'd 
be surprised what people will do if you just ask 
them. " 

A Viable, PermaDent Lobby 

In the long run, Twohy hopes to build a viable 
and permanent student lobby in Sacramento. To 

do this, he hopes to Â·~t $84,000 from the nine UC 
governments next year, much of which would be 
spent to supply a permanent office with deSKS, 
typewriters, a mimeo machine, etc. After that, 
Twohy estimates the lobby could function 
effectively on a yearly appropriation of $4fr 
50,000, including a salary for a secretary. 

Once established, the lobby would have three 
main functions. First, it would research vital 
issues, like the current legislative effort to 
revamp the California master plan for higher 
education, as well as scrutinize hundreds of bills 
each session for hidden clauses that might 
affect students or the University. This huge task 
would depend on an intern program to bring 
students to Sacramento for a quarter on special 
academic credit. There are three such interns 
working this quarter. 

Second, Twohy plans to develop a successful 
program of outright lobbying. This would 
involve, he said, "effective contact" with 
legislators, as well as preparation of statements 
and giving committee testimony on vital pieces 
of legislation. " We might from time to time 
support bills that we don't really care about," 
Twohy said, " so that their sponsors will owe us 
support on our own bills." 

But the real effectiveness of the lobby, said 
Twohy, will depend on the growth of an 
interested and active body of students on the 
campuses. "People will ignore us," he said, 
" unless they know we have broad support in our 
own constituency." 

'l'wohy hopes to disseminate information on 
pending bills on a regular basis to all regular UC 

students, possibly with a questionnaire to 
determine predominate student viewpoints. 
Twohy also envisions the establishment of 
"shadow committees" to follow, and to 
influence, the workings of vital legislative 
committees. The growth of this kind of 
organization, so vital to the ultimate success of 
the lobby, will be the responsibility of the local 
student governments. Twohy, for his part, 
would provide inputs of pertinent information 
and political expertise. 

The danger of becoming a partisan leftist 
organization is one to which Twohy is sensitive. 
"There is room in this office to help the 
conservative and radical students alike," he 
said, " the bald and the hairy, and down the 
line." Office space, use of the mimeo machines 
would be available to any regular student who 
had an interest in affecting a piece of 
legislation. " We'll help in any way we can, " 
Twohy said, " including setting up appointments 
with key lawmakers." 

This school year is almost over, but Twohy is 
hopeful that incoming student governments will 
give him the financial support he needs to 
continue his work in the fall. 

This year , ASUCSD contributed $1500 toward 
the student lobby. 

The nitty gritty of lobbying, meanwhile, keeps 
Twohy busy. The EOP bill provides a case in 
point: His claim of " just lucky" in getting the 
support of Bagley is plain false modesty ; the 
.lUccess of the proposal is due to hard work.

Moon rocks at UCSD 

UCSD Gets New Moon Rocks, 
Changes Aim of Lunar Study 

Mott Hinton 
Photo Editor 

James Arnold , professor of chemistry, yesterday showed to 
the press UCSD's latest shipment of moon rocks. The two 
specimens displayed, he said, were sections from a larger 
rock. roughly the size of a football , which was brought back tc 
earth by the Apollo 14 astronauts. 

The rocks are different from previous samples in that they 
are heterogeneous - composed of a mixture of several 
chemically and physically distinct minerals- in contrast to the 
largely homogeneous specimens collected on e.arlier missions, 
Arnold noted . One of the two chunks shown yesterday had been 
taken from the surface of the larger rock, and showed a small 
impact crater with crystalline inclusions. Whether this was the 
re ult of a micrometeorite impact or a hit from a piece of the 
moon thrown up by a nearby meteorite strike has not yet been 
determined, he added. I 

According to Dr. Arnold , the rock may have been formed or 
thrown up during the formation of nearby Cone Crater. Very 
early indications from other labs - and Dr. Arnold emphasized 
that the conclusions were strictly conjectural at this point-
uggest that the rock had been on the surface of the moon for 

around 15 million years . Other, earlier samples have shown 
exposure .times ranging upwards from one hundred million 
years. 

Arnold stated that the arrival of the new rocks here signals a 
change in the direction of UCSD's moon studies. Heretofore the 
emphasis has been on solar phenomena , investigating the 
effects of solar bombardment on lunar minerals and thus 
pr?ving a key to solar history. Now, however, the emphasis has 
shifted to lunar history. The researches begun with the new 
rocks will ultimately enable scientists to determine, by 
examination, exactly how long a given specimen of rock has 
been on the surface; or, if buried, how deep and for how long.

AS Candidate Doug Ballis 

'The games I play are the natural games' 
Corl Neiburger 

City Editor 
(Editor's note : Tbe following 

is tbe text of tbe first part of an 
interview witb AS Presidential 
candidate Doug Ballis. Betb 
Lyons is running witb bim as a 
candidate for Vice-President. 
According to Ballis, sbe is 
running on a platform of male-
cbauvinism.) 
Triton Times: Why do you feel 
you should be elected 
president? 
Doug Ballis: Let's get to a 
better question like why are 
you running or . .. 
17: OK, why are you running? 
Ballls: I'm running for the 
same reason everybody else is, 
you know ... 
17: What's that? 
Ballis: You really have a good 
job of being an interviewer, 
really pat down. The whole 
thing with the AS is that the 
Associated Students isn 't really 
that important an organization 
on campus, man, like all the 
other candidates are putting up 
all their posters and 
everything, saying, you know, 
we're going to decentralize it 
and make it a cooperation and 
take it off campus and this and 
that and everything. 
17: WELL Brian Ritter hasn 't 
said a thing about AS. 
Ballis : Brian Ritter is running 
because he 's run three years 
before ; it would be breaking 
the tradition. Besides I talked 
Ritter into running and I talked 
Shaw into running too. 
17: Well, why are you running 
yourself? 
Ballis : I'm running because I 
didn 't think Shaw and Ritter 
would be running. 
17: Well , now that they 're 
running why are you running? 
Ballis: I'm glad you asked that. 
Well , I'm running 'cau e 1 want 
to get elected. 
n: Why do you want to be 
elected? - This is what I a ked 
before. 
Balli.: Same reason as 
anybody else. 1 kind of like to 

do things like that. 
17: Why do you think people 
should vote for you? 
Ballis : I'm not going to go 
around playing any of the little 
games the other candidates are 
going to be playing. Like I'm 
not going to plaster my name 
all over saying vote for me 
because I Madison Avenue you , 
spreading my name so you 
know my name and I'm not 
going to create issues like 
decentralizing or things like 
that, saying that the problem is 
like the reason the AS doesn 't 
have any power is because it's 
institutionalized. 
17: What games are you going 
to play and what issu'es are you 
going to create? 
Ballis : The games I play are 
the natural games. 

T'I': Brian Ritter said that. 
Ballis: That's true, Brian 
Ritter did say that. The thing is 
people like Brian Ritter aren 't 
going to get elected. 
T'I': Well are you going to be 
elected? 
,Ballis: Yeah 
T'I' : Why? 
Ballis: Why not? 
T'I': Oh, if people don 't vote for 
you you won 't get elected. 
Ballis: That may be in som> 
circles. I didn 't say what I was 
going to be elected as. 
T'I': Well what are you going to 
be elected as? 
Ballis : Let's go back into the 
AS, OK? The problem isn 't 
with the AS's institutions, that 
nothing's done or they can 't get 
anywhere or that the students 
don 't feel like they 're being 

represented. The problem is in 
fact with the people, with the 
students in AS and the students 
outside of AS. 
T'I': David Shaw said that. 
Ballis: Who do you think told 
Dave Shaw that? 
T'I' : Did you tell Karl Keating 
his platform too? 
Ballis : Excuse me. 
T'I' : Three years ago Brian 
Ritter 's was Town Meetings. 
Ballis : Yeah, town meetings. 
OK that's even better than Karl 
Keating 's platform, I mean 
candidates run on a platform 
every year . They just change 
the platform but it's the same 
people, you know, hoping that 
maybe this time my platform 
will snowjob a few people into

Ground Broken Tuesday for 
Future International Center 

Tina Breakstone 
Staff Writer 

Groundbreaking ceremonies took place Tuesday on the site 
of the old Archery Range east of Bonner Hall for the future 
International Center, scheduled for completion in the fall of 
this year . Funded almost enti rely by gift fu nds, the Center will 
include offices and lounges for both foreign students and San 
Diego students involved in overseas educa lion programs. 

Designed by campus architect Robert Thorburn, the Center 
will resemble. not the giant concrete structures of MUir 
College, but , according to Vice Chancellor George Murphy, 
" the best of Matthews." The Center will be composed of a 
small cluster of wooden buildings, the tallest being only two 
stories high. 

The International Center, Murphy told the TRITON TIMES, 
is only the first stage of a three-stage buildi~g program which 
will eventually include another cluster of bUlldmgs devoted to 
student workshops in ceramics , sewing and other areas, and a 
commuter student lounge. These buildings will be located 
northeast of Bonner Hall. 

The third stage. to be known as the Student Center. will be a 
complex including a bowling alley, theatre , eating facilities , 
music listening and pract.ice rooms, and more lounges. Also 
located here will be the Health Center, and the offices of 
Campus Student Affairs. now housed In 250 Matthews Campus. 

A Building Advisory Committee composed of student 
representatives from each college, representatives from the 
AS, a graduate student and three members of the 
administrative staff, has been formed to help develop plans 
and propose designs for the Student Center. Working with the 
Planning Office and the architectural engineers, the 
Committee has devised a plan whereby $6,000 of the $6-student 
fee funds collected over the last year and a haH will be used to 
pay for the extension of the utility tunnel , which will in the 
future connect the International Center with the Student 
Center. 

Muir Curriculum Reform Shelved; 
Faculty Forms Study Commission 

Frank Phillips 
Staff Writer 

The Muir College faculty voted . Tuesday to set up a 
commission " to examine the operation of the MUIr College 
curriculum." The action had the effect of suspending 
consideration of proposals for changes In the gradualton 

present requirements, and an examination of stude~t ~nd 
faculty educational objectives ," The college commiSSIon, 
which will be formed under the direction of the college provost, 
is expected to issue a comprehensive report in the fall. The 
commission will consist of facul ty , students and college 
administrators. 

In making his motion, Professor Gusfield said that an. effort 
has not been made to determine what the problems wIth the 
present curriculum are, and what students want out of their 
education. Several persons challenged t~e need for a new 
study. Dr. Frank Halpern said that anythmg the com~TlI sslOn 
comes up with will have little to do wIth Improvmg the 
curriculum. 

requirements of the collel(e. . 
At the beginning of Tuesday's meetmg. Provost John Stewart 

withdrew his proposal for changmg the graduatIOn 
requirements, which he introduced several weeks ago to the 
faculty . Stewart said that recent developments have conVinced 
him that the demands for requirement changes "are symptoms 
of a larger problem which won 't be solved by merely changing 
the required curriculum." 

Stewart commented that a report by a Contemporary issues 
class published in Tuesday's TRITON TIMES was very 
"timely ." The report, drawn up by a class concerned with the 
educational philosophy of John Muir College, called for a 
greater committment to the ideals of the College, as expressed 

Muir Council member Steve Clark proposed that the 
commission make specific recommendations about changes 
needed. His amendment, seconded by his sister Diddo, was 
defeated.

Stewart withdrew his proposal for a revision of graduatIOn 

requirements in order that a proposal for the esta blishment of 
a college commission could b~ introduced. Profes~or Joseph 
Gusfield , chairman of the SocIOlogy Department, mtroduced 
the commission proposal on behalf of himself and Professors 
Roy D'Andrade, Michel Benamou and Michael Parrish. 

During the discussion of Gusfield 's proposal Professor 
Victor Rumsey suggested that professors have greater contact 
with undergraduates. He proposed that each professor teach a 
freshman course limited to thirty students. He said that each 
professor would only have to teac~ one s~ch cours~ ever,Y two 
years. Because he made his motton durmg the diSCUSSIOn of 
Gusfield's proposal, it was ruled out of order. Rumsey said he 
will continue to work for hi s proposal.

with preparing a summary of its findings concerning current 
areas of student concern, faculty and student opinion involving

Hare Krishna 

Krishna Seeks Liberation from Turmoil 
Rose DeCosta 
Staff Writer 

Donned in a simple orange wrap-
around, an eye-catching individual with 
shaven-head and tambourine in hand 
vehemently chants out " Hare Krishna , 
Hare Krishna , Krishna Krishna" ... 
Chanting Hare Krishna , the name of the 
Lord . is, according to the International 
Society of Krishna Consciousness , "the 
only means of liberation in this age of 
conflicts and turmoil. " 

Five years ago the Krishna religion 
was introduced to the Western world by 
Swami Prabhupada , an Indian master 
who was ordered by the godhead to 
spread this faith . For years Prabhupada 
was in India translating Sanscript and 
then with his books he went to New 
York , arriving with only seven dollars . 
There he spent the days chanting his 
salvation in the parks. Prabhupada 
managed to attract a few followers and 
now Krishna Consciousness has spread 
to various areas of the U.S. 

San Diego has its own Krishna 
community, located on Park Boulevard . 
Seven members reside there. Every 
norning at 4 :30 a.m., the Krishna 
followers partake in a ceremonial 
service called arotike (welcoming of the 
Lord ). During this ha If-hour service, 
they offer Krishna a 6-7 course breakfast 
along with flowers and gifts as tokens of 
thei r love. After the offering, the meal is 

distributed and consumed amongst the 
followers . This type of offering is typical 
of every meal. 

Krishna members eat no meat, fish, 
or eggs. Their diets consist of meals 
prepared following the over 1000 recipes 
found in the Vedic Scriptures. On Sunday 
afternoons at 2 p.m. a public feast is 
held at the Pepper Grove Picnic area in 
Balboa Park, to which all are invited to 
taste the "wonderful food of Kri shna." 

Krishna followers spend the majority 
of their time preaching, and money is 
not a prime concern of theirs. They do, 
however , manage to exist on income 
received from making and distributing 
incense, along with whatever donations 
are collected. 

Four Regulative Principles 
The Krishna community lives by four 

regulative principles . (1) No intoxicants 
are allowed, intoxicants being drugs, 
cigarettes, and alcoholic and carbonated 
beverages. (l) Illicit sex . is not 
permissable. Marriage is allowed. and 
married members are dlstmgUlshed 
from the rest by the color of their dress. 
Married people wear yellow or white 
robes and single followers wear orange. 
(3) Gambling is not allowed. Gambling 
not only regards money but also 
speculation. No one should try to 
speculate about the future . (4) No meat, 
fish or eggs are to be consumed .. 

Costuming in quite impressive and 

symbolic in this religion. The plain 
robes are worn as a sign of 
disassociation from material items. 
Shaving of the head is a proclamation of 
the concept of god and the few strands of 
hair that are left uncut (called sikha ) 
symbolize the presence of a "personal 
god." Life beads worn around the neck 
indicate giving up of life to Kri shna, and 
a string of counting beads is used to keep 
track of the number of times the Hare 
Krishna chant is recited. There are 108 
beads to a string and Krishna believers 
are obligated to chant 16 times around 
the beads daily, as the entire movement 
is based on this chant. These chants are 
believed to "keep minds constantly 
fixed on the presence of Krishna ." 

As a means of "making the soul a 
conscious part of the body, " clay 
markings (referred to as tilaks ) 
symbolizing the Lord are placed on 12 
fixed areas of the body. 

To join the Krishna movement, a 
person must undergo a six-month 
initiation period to indicate sincerity to 
the cause. After this period, he is given 
his life beads and also a spiritual name. 

The San Diego chapter of Krishna 
Consciousness has been making efforts 
to recruit followers from the UCSD 
community, as indicated by their 
period ic visits to the campus. Also every 
Tuesday evening a class in Bhakti-Yoga 
is conducted in Building 2C on the 
second floor . 

Meetings to Help Students Pick Maiors 
The Revelle Committee on 

College Affairs has announced 
that it and the academic 
departments are co-sponsoring 
a series of meetings designed 
to give the student an 
opportun ity for gai ning 

ipfor~ation that wil} help him 
ih decldmg on a major field of 
study. 

According to the committee 
and Dean Tom Hull of Revelle 
College . the program is

Invited to attend. 

Each department was asked 
to organize a panel 01 two 
laculty members, a graduate 
student and an undergraduate 
student to serve as resource 
people to an wer any que tions

David Shaw 
I am not interested in being a 

good AS President. Rather, my 
candidacy challenges the 
institution itself : I maintain 
that the Associated Students 
are not associated - that no 
legislative body representing 
UCSD students exists at 
present . It is not clear to me. 
in fact , that there is a need for 
sucha body. 

More surprISing. perhaps. 
the junkie does not hate the 
cop. but recognizes and accepts 
the same game. As perceive4 
by junkie and cop alike. the 
function of the junkie is to do 
his dope thing and hide from 
the cop. and the function of the 
cop is to chase. beat and 
persecute the junkie. Neither 
challenges the rules . Both 

Both the incumbent and 
proposed AS governments are 
pretentious and delusive, 
engaj(ing primarily in self-
legitimati on ( that is , 
genera ting needs and activities 
for themselves) . The few 
useful functions se rved by our 
glorified high school student 
government ( e .g . 
facilita ting dances and 
concerts. funding various 
groups ) co uld easily be 
performed by a si ngl e 
commit tee without the 
ostentation and expense 
involved in our junior U.S. 
Congress. 

Let us. then, accept the fact 
that. str ipped of its pretenses. 
AS government is. and will 
most likely continue to be. a 
private pa rty to which most of 
us will not be invited : it is an 
absorbing diversion for some of 
the guests , and an exhil.irating 
ego trip for the others. Let us 
turn our attention elsewhere. 

In ew York . junkies and 
cops rna intain a peculiar bllt 
stab le symbiot ic relationship. 
The narcotics officer neither 
despises nor sympathizes with 
the heroin pu sher . but 
considers him an omnipresent

defined game .

legitimize the game. This 
interests me more than AS 
salaries. 

I am completing a double 
major in APIS and math. Most 
of the cops who run my classes 
make the lives of their junkies 
miserable. Many consider 
their undergraduate class 
responsibilities an imposition. 
and teach accordingly . 
Learning is force-fed and self-
motivation is stripped from the 
educational experience . 
Lectu rers are incredibly 
insensitive to the state of 
attention of stUdents . 
Professors thrust arbitrary, 
immutable. humiliating course 
requirements at their reluctant 
but complicit students . 

Extracurricular learning, 
199Â·s. and the Evan's system 
for Math classes must have 
convinced some students that. 
quite apart from being boring 
and nerveracking. faculty-
defined education with its due-
date homework . non-evaluative 
exams and a~sassination of 
creative thought doesn't eveD 
work , lJCSD faculty and 
administrators have not shown 
an overwhelming interest in 
student par ticipation in the 
plenary, administrative and 
eva luative a pects of their 
classes. but I can 't blame 
them : it's easier to be a cop 
when there are so many willing 
junkies around .

It is indeed absurd to accord respect or legitimacy to a 
government if it cannot accomplish the objectives of the people 
it is intended to serve; but we contend that the potential and 
the capabilities of the AS are significant, and deserve your 
respect as well as support. As evidence, 

We intend to implement the following Platform : 
(1) FORM AN OFF-CAMPUS STUDENT CORPORATION 

TO CREATE AN INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL BASE FOR 
T~E ASUCSI? Money could be raised, invested, and then 
remvested ; WIth enough money , the AS would no longer have to

Karl Keating and 
Mike Sheerin 

In lieu of the usual platttudinous platform, some comments 
on sense and nonsense in the current campaign : 

(1) The total amount of salaries disbursed by the AS does, 
indeed, approximate $30,000. For the secretaries alone : 
$13,200. For the eleven Councilmen alone : $4.350. For the 
Councilmen's travel expenses alone : $1 ,500. For the "Coast 
Cruiser" bus driver alone : $1.500. For the TRITON TIMES 
alone : $2,700. And for KSDT, the Communications Board. the 
Program Board, the student ombudsman in Sacramento, and 
several other individuals and groups : no less than $4,400. The 
total : at least $27,650. Add to this all the other little 
expenditures (which are rather difficult to extricate from the 
confUSing files ), and one ends with roughly $30.000. 
Remember : the $30,000 represents about fc" ty pel cent of the 
AS budget of $77 ,000; and all forty per cent goe for salaries. 

(2) In a recent statement Paul Kaufman said that the AS 
salaries totaled only $4.350 : his statement was misleading. The 
$4 ,350 went to the Council members alone. Many other people 
also received salaries. 

(3 1 Diddo Clark insisted that the AS budget was $86.000 last 
year. Amazing. considering that (a I this year's budget was 
only $77,000. (b l UCSD had 700 more undergraduates this year 
than last . and Ie) the rate of taxation-$6 per quarter-has 
rem~ined constant. We suggest that Diddo take an arithmetic 
class. 

(41 Paul Kaufman is very confUSing : worse, he i not well 
versed in legal matters. Example : Paul desires to maintain 
compulsory AS fees . yet he desires to transform the AS into a 
corporation . The rub : the fees cannot be compulsory if the AS 
were a corporation . for no one can be forced to join any such 
business organization. 

( 5 ) Dlddo Clark termed Karl Keating 'S views " racist 
eli tist. " What can one say? One can merely regret that name-
calling has been introduced into the campaign . How ironic that 
in the same issue of the TRITO TIMES, in the same issue in 
which she used the phrase " racist elitist ," Diddo demanded an 
apology from Jim Sills for certain "slanderous statements" 
that Sill su pposedly made. ote : calling someone a racist is 
slanderou . is it not? Smce Dlddo will. we know. abide by the 
ethkal standard ' that she dem3l1ds of others, we shall expect 
to soon read her public apology. For her " landerous 
statements." of course.

The University community is 
a microcosm with unique 
problems and needs. The 
bureaucracy of the University 
often overlooks the needs of the 
students and the need for a 
commission of student welfare 
arises . Supervision of student 
services. which include Student 
Health Service and the 
bookstore, is part of the 
Commissioner's job. This year 
the new health center is to be 
designed and hopefully the 
commissioner can push for 
development and construction 
of the student center. 

Such special projects as a 
birth control clinic and a 
student disc'O\)nt program with 
local merchants can be 
developed . Ideally. the 
bookstore should seek to buy 
and sell used books and become 
an AS enterpri e enabling it to 
grow with the campus. not the 
UC budget.

It has bet'n sU/(l(cs ted that the 
AS I ~ triVial or un important. 
At present. thi s IS untrue The 
amount 01 money di sposed of 
by the AS. on the order of 

$75 .000. is far from trivial. 
tangibly something like 18.000 
stereo records or 500 kilograms 
of dope . I propose that this is a 
government of monstrous 
proportions and that this 
cancerous growth is the result 
of the great flow of money 
extorted out of UCSD students 
in the form of quarterly student 
fees . 

Like any cancer. this growth 
has had numerous bad effects. 
;imong them burgeoning AS 
salaries and the subsidization 
of numerou s questionable 
enterprises. 

1 am confident that the AS 
can operate without forcing the 
students to support it. In other 
words. that government can be 
both just and effective. 
Elections are more than a little 
ridiculous. The way to make 
the AS truly democratic is to 
put the purse strings in the 
hands of the individual students 
where they belong. I would like 
to see a graduated system of 
fees whereby a student can pay 
any amou nt of money from 
zero on up depending on what 
kind of services he is willing to 
pay lor. 
It is on the issue of voluntary 

fees and a just student

Like most students. 1 feel that 

the present AS government is 
unresponsive to student needs 
and is more or less farcical in 
its methods of operation. 
However. this situa tion is not 
inherently necessary . With the 
acquisition of a professional 
lobbyist for the student 
governments of all UC 
campuses. we have taken a 
significant ste p towards 
acquiring power in our own 
interests. and as Commissioner 
of External Affairs I would try 
to develop this to its fullest 
extent in Sacramento. 

My platform is to lower AS 
salaries tincluding mine I. 
whose present excesses 
constitute a waste of your 
money. and to lobby for student 
power by increasing 
communication between the 
Regents and UCSD. Our 
campus does not need trailer 
parks, shopping centers, or 
fluorescent bicycle ramps: It 
needs to maint~in its present 
high standards of instruction 
and research, We do not need 
candidates who don 't take the 
AS seriously. or those who are 
campaigning for their own 
personal ambition ; we need 
those who are willing to work. 
and to work hard. We. as 
students. have the potential to 
become a cogent and unWed

Referendum on AS Fees 
Pro - Jim Sills 

Commissioner of Academic Affa irs 

In this election. you will have a chance to vote 
on a most important question ; voluntary 
membership in the Associated Students. If this 
question is passed, each student will have the 
right to c~oose whether he wishes to belong to 
the ASSOCiated StUdents. Presently. there is no 
choice, each student must belong, and must pay 
$6 per quarter to the AS. 

As a member of the AS Council this year, I've 
had an opportunity to see what happens to the 
SIX dollars each undergraduate is required to 
surrender to the AS each quarter. It has been a 
soberi ng experience. 

Money is wasted on excessive salaries. 
"travel expenses" used to attend drunken blow-
outs. and various other pet projects designed to 
please the little gang of malingerer and crooks 
who have controlled the various organs of the 
AS over the past few years. 

"OK . Sills, why don 't you do something about 
it? " All right. I have. Karl Keating and I are 
circulating petitions to put a very special 
question on the upcoming general election 
ballot. This question would ask students 
whether AS fees should remain compUlsory. or 
if the payment of such fees should be voluntary. 
In other words. should the individual determine 
for himself whether the AS is worthy of his 
continued support. not to mention his $6 a 
quarter? 

It seems fairly clear tha t most students would 
support this right of individual choice. 
Therefore. however. you can expect the 
masters and retainers of the Associated 
Students to trot out a number of lies , There are. 
after all . interests to protect. A certain campus 
newspaper (initials : 'IT ) received about $7.000 
from AS this year. a certain radio station 
several thousand other dollars , Should the 
students have a chance to choose for 
themselves. AS income might plummet, and 
with it the amount appropriated to certain 
organizations. 

Certain little lies will thus be employed to 
confuse the electorate into voting against their 
own liberties. The most likely lie to be 
employed is : "If fees are voluntary then there 
won 't be any more dances or concerts." Now, as 
a matter of fact. the AS currently provides only 
15 per cent of the income of tile Campus-wide 
Programming Board. The other ~ per cent 
comes from the Regents or from registration 
fees . 

Such little arguments . of course. miss the real 

point. If th~ AS government. through the ticket 
dIscounts It prOVides (and other benefits ) is 
really worthwhile. then lots of students will 
choose to pay the $6 a quarter voluntarily . When 
the opponents of voluntary AS fees say the AS 
government will collapse without compulsory 
fees , they are themselves delivering the most 
devastating indictment of the AS. They are 

s~ying. that the only way AS can get any 
finanCIal support is to coerce it away from its 
constituents. They are saying that, left to their 
own . the students would abandon the AS 
government. 

Con - Mike 'Heavy' Palcic 
AS President 

The proposed constitutional amendment that 
eliminates mandatory membership in AS and 
mandatory payment of AS fees would have the 
effect of eliminating a vital resource for student 
projects and activities. 

With finanCing solely from AS fees all over 
the slate the Student Legislative program was 
able to get off the ground this year. 
Recruitment programs run by BSU and 
MECHA to locate more minority students to 
attend the University were supported by AS 
fees . The mandatory fee seeded the 
development of AS projects such as the Coffee 
Hut Expansion ana the Coast Cruiser. Many 
other student groups depend on A.S. fees to help 
carry out their work : UNA. ASA. Food Co-op, 
WLF. Rites of Spring, are a few examples. 

AS funds have also been used to enhance the 
educational experience al the University 
through funding of the ISSUES NOW last fall. 
. All of this is on top of substantial expenditures 
In the areas of students communications media 
and programming. Also, the AS offices get a~ 
average stipend of about $30-40 per month- BIG 
DEAL. 

The point is that the mandatory fee supports a 
broad range of student endeavor and 
eliminating that source would simply bring a 
halt to all activities or the portions of those 
activities supported by the fee . Moreover in 
many instances the student fee supports 
programs that could not be funded through 
other sources, beginning work in new areas of 
University students' concern. 

Finally, this money could not be replaced 
from other sources in the immediate future 
While a self-supporting AS with voluntary fee~ 
might be a viable lonl term solution to ' 
financinl the AS, it would not meet the 
immediate need for this resource.

posit ion I am now seeking to be 
labelled as "qualifications " 
Each new posit ion is a unique 
experience with diffe rent 
r e qu i r e me nts a nd 
organizational structure. The 
basic qualification that I can 
relate to th e off ice of 
community service is my 
interest and concern for the 
people thi office involves. I 
feel thai this interest and 
concern should be a part of all 
candidates for office. 

The ba ic services which I 
hope to establish for the 
co mmunity are : I) a n 
investigation into the heal th 
conditions in Southeast San 
Diego: 2 ) volunteer student 
services in the Headstart 
program : 3) a completed 
summ e r ca mp for 
und erprivil eged chil dr en 
(wh ich is st i l l und e r 
constru ction ); 4 ) more 
community participation in 
campus wide activilies so that 
there could be better profit and 
lower student fees: 5) a larger 
community interaction project 
which would bring the school 
closer to the community by 
having volunteer students go 
into _the community and doing 
away with misconceptions of 
the University. 

UCSD has the potential to 
help get certain programs on 

Clark ... 

the road. But so far UCSD has 
collectively sat on its "rear 
end " and let everything pass 
by. If elected. I would try to 
help relieve UCSD of its 
" White Man's Burden." But 
~ince I am a write-in candidate, 
It can only be done with the 
help of concerned students.

As commissione r of 
community service I would 
concentrate o n the 
development of projects and 
programs which would bring 
the local communities into a 
more meaningful interplay 
with the University. In the 
past. most students at UCSD 
have been too "involved" with 
only their academic studies 
rather than integrating them 
with community studies. With 
the development of a n 
intellectual mind there must 
also be the development of 
community awareness. 

This awareness must come in 
the form of utilization of the 
student's talents in seeking to 
bring changes in our present 
structure which discriminates 
against those who socially and 
economica lly are unable to 
compete with those who fa'/o r 
" ma t erialism" over 
"humani m." Our ch~nce to 
develop a better working 
relationship between local 
communitles and UCSD can be 
done through student projects 
which are developed and 
coordinated by the students . 
My job will be to encGurage and 
assist tho e students who have 
realized that there is a need for 
commun ity involve ment.

Buckley Slated for nstruction Underway on 
University Extension Facility lecture Monday 

Mark Silge' 
Slaff Writer 

Construction began April 19 on a new building 
for the University Extension that will house 
vitally needed work, storage and classroom 
space, this while state budget cutbacks have 
curtailed most new construction. 

When asked how this project is being funded , 
John Stark, Administrative Services Officer, 
explained that for several years the Extension 
has been able to operate under its funds 
gathered from the general operation fees. 

A year ago, the Extension decided that it 
should use these funds to construct a new 
building. With a staff of over 40 the present 
facility. built in 1966. is now bursting at the 
seams. Offices serve as storage rooms, and the 
central reception area is often so crowded and 
noisy it is impossible to carryon a normal 
conversation. There is not even enough room 
available for a collection of the textbooks being 
used in this quarter's courses. 

The Extension, Stark said. would welcome 
volunteers to help in ma ny parts of their 
operation. Those interested may contact the 
University of California Extension, Box 109, or 
453-2000, extension 2061.

The fact-finding investigation began at 
University Hall, Berkeley, the headquarters for 
statewide UC administration. Twohy found that 
there were no comprehensive figures on how 
many students apply for EOP. how many are 
eligible, and how many of these have to be 
turned away for lack of funds . Twohy 
discovered that the $1.5 million the University 
asked from the state for EOP was an arbitrary 
request, based on accidental factors, like a "16 
per cent growth rate ." 
"Either UC lacks a commitment to EOP," he 

concluded, "or they have grossly mismanaged 
it out of pure incompetence." 

Twohy also found out that the $8 million 
already spent on EOP does not include any state 
appropriation. Much of it comes from special 
Regen ts' revenue, like overhead on the Atomic 
Energy Commission research at Livermore and 
Los Alamos, and almost $3 million comes from 
UC students at some campuses who have voted 
to tax themselves to support EOP. 

Owen Joyner 
Associate City Ed;tor 

William F. Buckley Jr., 
prince darling of the 
conservative movement in 
America will be at UCSD 
Monday night. The multi-
talented political personality is 
scheduled to lead a panel 
discussion with three other 
conserva ti ve thinkers on 
" Revolution , Reform and 
Conscience" at 8:30 p.m. in the 
Gym . The program is 
sponsored by DIMENSION 
with financial help from 
Campus Studies Institute. 

Tuesday the three other 
panelists, M. Stanton Evans. 
Jeffrey Hart and Ernest van 
den Haag, will each direct 
three one-hour seminar classes 
on campus. A wrap-up panel 
discussion with the three will 
take place in the gym at 8 p.m. 
that evening. 

Buckley, called "one of the 
most intelligent men in the 
country" by some and branded 
a "crypto-Nazi" by others has 
been on the national political 

scene since he founded the 
Nadoul Review in 1955 and 
has written prolifically on 
conservatism since then. His 
thrice-weekly political column 
appears in more than 300 
newspapers. 

Buckley ran a semi-serious 
campaign for Mayor of New 
York in 1965, bringing much 
attention to his candidacy with 
colorful comments like " If 
elected ] will demand a 
recour.t," He lost the election 
but was given his own TV show, 
Firing Line. on which he has 
matched wits with such 
"champions" in American 
rhetoric as George Wallace, 
Jane Fonda , Michael 
Harrington and many others. 

Among the other panelists to 
appear Monday night, Evans is 
editor of the Indianapolis 
News. His books include Tbe 
Liberal EstablisilmeDt. Revolt 
o. the Campus, The Politics of 
Surreader. The Future 01 
Couservatism. 

Dr . Hart , an English 
professor at Dartmouth, is 
formerly a speech writer and 

William F. Buckley 

political consultant to 
Governor Ronald Reagan and 
President Nixon. He is a senior 
editor o( National Review. 

Dr. van den Haag is 
professor of social philosophy 
at New York University, as 
well as lecturer in psychology 
and sociology at the New 
School (or Social Research. His 
writings have appeared in 
numerous scholarly journals, 
as well as such popular 
magazines as Harper s, 
National Review and Esquire. 

The new facility . designed by Lloyd Koenig 
and Campus, Architect Jack Rule, will closely 
resemble the present Extension building. Using 
the same warm styling with an abundance of 
wood, the two-story building will house work 
and storage rooms. restrooms and a large 
classroom on the first floor. and a central 
reception area surrounded by offices on the 
second floor . The total floor space will be 3000 
sq. ft. The present building has 3600 sq. flo The 
highlight of the new building is the large 
classroom area. Free of any fixed structures, it 
can be partitioned in any way and can hold 
almost any type of furniture . This will be used 
for many of the courses that often defy the 
rigidity of normal classrooms. 

To redress this failure of the state to finance 
EOP. Twohy collected figures from around the 
UC system and put together a statement that 
includes an estimation of eligible applicants to 
EOP that are turned away for lack of money. ]n 
his 10-page brief for the bill , Twohy explains 
that only academic ability , and not financial 
ability to pay, should be a factor in who is 
admitted to U C 

Ballis Interview .. . 

The total cost of construction is $54.000. The 
new addition, to be located just west of the 
present Extension building on Matthews 
Campus, is expected to be completed in 100 
days. The Extension is averaging a 15 per cent 
increase in its enrollment each year. ]n the four 
quarters of the 1970-71 school year, more than 
26,000 people are expected to participate in 
Extension courses offered at UCSD, according 
to Stark. With this increase will come added 
classes, programming, paperwork , and a need 
for more space. The two buildings on Matthews 
Campus will house Extension Facilities 
indefinitely, as the land is not involved in 
present plans for permanent UCSD buildings. 

Twohy knows that the legislature has voted 
expenditures for EOP in the past, but that each 
time, Reagan has vetoed them. "In 26 years," 
he said, "no California legislature has 
overridden a governor's veto. " 

Twohy concludes that students must organize 
themselves in support of this bill so that if 
Reagan does feel compelled to veto part of the 
$6 million that the legislature will hopefully 
appropriate , the governor will at least let some 
of it go through. " Even if we only get one or two 
million in the end, " said Twohy, " it will be 
worth it for t,he students that it helps."

individual. That's what I was 
getting around to before, that 
it's not the institution of the AS 
that needs change or anything,

Now there's six candidates . 
Three of them are 
running-they're sticking to

change and the AS needs this or

1%) EST ABLISH THE POSITION OF .. ASUCSD 
ADMINISTRATIVE REPRESENTATIVE" TO MINIMIZE 
THE DISADVANTAGE WHICH THE STUDENT NOW 
SUFFERS WITHIN THE UN]VERSITY BUREAUCRACY. 
The administrator has always enjoyed two advantages over the 
student: first, the administration is an on-going structure and 
second. the administrator spends full time on the job. ]n 
contrast, students are limited in the amount of time they can 
spend in committee meetings Simply because they have 
classwork to do. leave campus during summer and quarter 
breaks, and undergo a continuous and rapid turnover which 
prevents their accumulating experience. Thus, students all too 
often miss th~ir opportunity to influence those decision-making 
processes which directly Involve them . To minimize this, we 
would like to create the permanent position of Administrative 
Representative. This person, a full-time employee of the 
ASUCSD, would be able to assist students with ideas and give 
the AS some continuity,

val.ue of the contract is that any differences between 
Umverslty and students become differences of law, and the 
students can seek redress against the Uni versity in the courts. 

IS) EXPAND THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY PROGRAM 
ITHE UC-WIDE "STUDENT LOBBY") . This will enable us to 
draft our own bills for such things as increasing scholarship 
money (and perhaps even obtaining permission to sell 
alcoholic beverages on campus). 

16) OPEN BLACK'S BEACH TO STUDENTS.

immediately ; only the Planned Program Guide remains to be

many students as possible in the planning and design of the 
student nion complex. 

18) IMPROVE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE AS 
AND THE STUDENT BODY AND EXPAND PUBLIC

19) SUPPORT AND FUND AN ON-GOING "SUBSID]ARY" 
OF THE FUSD (LOCATED ON CAMPUS) TO PURSUE

accused us of "manufacturing" issues. Nonsense, and they 
know it. We have merely been emphasizing what we consider 
to be the major issues (voluntary fees , reduced salaries, 
decentralization ). While we have been di cussing these issues, 
the other candidates have by and large ignored them by 
terming them "non-issues," 
(71 More than 900 undergraduates signed the petition which 

put on the ballot the question : Should the AS fees be voluntarily 
or manditorily paid? And several hundred students signed the 
petition which put on the ballot the question : Should the AS 
Council's salaries be reduced by at least half? These figures 
indicate that one-quarter of the students (and probably many 
more ) do not consider these proposals to be " nonÂ·issues. " 

(81 Karl Keating and Mike Sheerin initiated the drive to put 
these questions on the ballot. and in response to Keating and 
Sheerin the other candidates breathed fire and brimstone. 
What we two accomplished was the organization of a campaign 
based not on personalities, but on issues. And for UCSD this 
was truly a "first. "

March on S.F. 
Tomorrow is the April 24 San 

Francisco anti -war march, sponsored 
by the Peace Action Coalition . It is a 
Western focal point for a number of 
this month's peace activities, which 
will culminate with the May 5 
Moratorium Day , the first 
ann iversary of the Kent State 
massacre. 

The march in San Francisco is 
attracting a Â· wider range of 
participants than ever before, with 
contingents from labor organizations, 
women 's groups, G I units, and even 
elected officials. But there is a st ill 
larger group of " veteran" protesters 
who are disillusioned about marching 
in yet one more demonstration, and 
who are cyn i cal about the 
effectiveness of non-violent or of even 
violent methods to force an end to the 
war . 

Yet these are the very people who 
should go to San Franc isco and attend 
the loca l demonstrat ions. They will 
give a more seasoned tone to the 
march, and prevent over-opt imistic 
euphor ia from unduly raising the 
hopes of the newer participants. If the 
asp i rat i ons of tomorrow ' s 
demonstrators are realistiC, the 
march may serve several useful 
purposes. 

F i rst, and perhaps mos t 
important ly, a large turnout at San 
Francisco (and at Washington) will 
prove to the nation, to the government, 
and to the marchers themselves, that 
the peace movement is still alive. It 
will show that the movement does not 

abide with Nixonian "winding down" 
policy, that it is not simply a reaction-
or iented group of students on a Spring 
lark, that it is not preCisely anti-war, 
but more accurately, pro-peace. 

Second, a demonstration will 
re inforce the efforts of those timid, 
Johnny-come-lately Democratic 
preSidential candidates and 
congressmen to reassert their 
constitutiona I authority over the war-
making powers of this country. 

Thirdly, the Peace Action 
Coalition's activities can provide a 
new rallying point for the movement 
as a whole, from which it can once 
again serve as a vital polit ical and 
educational force. . 

1971 is not 1968 - too many events 
have come between, too many people 
have died. Those who are opposed to 
th is disgraceful Indochina war must 
return to the struggle in order to end it 
through sustained act ion, not 
occasional reaction . Participating 
tomorrow at San Franc isco is a first 
step towards r~newed effort and a 
reunited opposition that can be 
effective on a number of fronts. 

Locally, the SMC Moratorium Day 
march against the Naval Electronics 
Laboratory can be San Diego's part in 
the larger effort _ The decade-long war 
in I ndochina has out-worn its friends 
and enemies alike-it will not be ended 
by disillus ion and cynicism, but only 
through organized and unceasing 
action, which beg ins with, and is 
trained through demonstrations li ke 
tomorrow's march. 

A Second Term? 
This year in the AS elections we 

have the phenomenon of two persons 
running for a second term in the same 
off ice. We feel that th is i s not in 
keeping with the spirit and intent of 
student government. Student 
government shou ld be an affair where 
a large number of students 
part iCipate. We think that it is 
perfectly logical that one office in 
student government serve as the 
tra ining ground for another, but we 
can see no value in an individual 
repeat ing in the same office for a 
second yea r _ 

If there were no qualified candidates 
running for the offices concerned, then 

triton 

there might be a reason for a 
cont inuation of the incumbent. But, 
this is not the case. Both offices are 
being contested by qualified students 
with exper ience in the areas 
concerned . 

Pol icy prevents us from endorsing 
AS candidates and we don't intend to 
do so . However, there are incumbent 
candidates for the offices of Program 
Board Cha irman and Commissioner of 
Academic Affairs_ We don't know the 
reason why these persons are seeking 
a second term, but we feel that in no 
way do the facts justify their actions. 

We hope students will take our views 
into consideration when voting.

AS Salaries 
Sleven Griffin 

Money-that simple. five- letter word 
represents the complex mechanism on which all 
modern society is based. Money provides a 
system of economic valuation. Idea lly. the 
dollar bill serves as an economic indicator 
representing the value of the services rendered , 
on a conveniently standardized scale. 

Locally, there has been a lot of gibberish over 
the aggregate remuneration of the officers in 
the organization, which collectively (like it or 
not!' represents the entire student body at 
UCSD : the AS. An example might be . AS 
negotia tions with the local su permarkets over 
the possibility of student discounts in return for 
the "guaranteed" student volume. Any possible 
student "power" is necessarily going to be a 
collective effort ; the A.S organization would be 
the commune. 

"Superficially Suspicious" 

Recently, the officers of the Associated 
Students voted themselves sa lary increases out 
of the student body fund . which is superficially 
suspicious. It is my understanding that the 
president of the AS receives $900 presently. 
There is an absurd clamor to reduce. yes. 
REDUCE this salary. 

The president. the " innovator," the student 
speaker for the commune is paid $900 annually ; 
there are several people trying to reduce thi s! 
The person is paid $900. who represents several 
thousand people and who spends several 
thousand dollars through the AS council he ' 
controls. A corporate would expect a salary 
exceeding $100.000 in a company th'lt size. 

Obviously, we can 't compete economically (l 
don 't mean to even infer we might want to ). 
But, is our AS president less important? Excuse 
me. that is an atrocious theoretical error. But. 
SHOULD our AS presidency be a less 
responsible or less important position? 

" It Is Very Possible ... " 
It is very possible that one truly creative AS 

president could gea r up the Community 
Interaction Program to a point whereby the 
local reactionary political fears of the populace 
could be reversed. It is very possible that one 
truly creative AS president could create or 
discover viable al ternatives to the quarterly 

MDRap 

tribulations at the bookstore. It is very possible 
tha t one truly creative AS president could 
\ indirectly- through external funding ) expand 
the Coffee Hut into a major student center. An 
excellent president might start a grocery store 
on campus (hopefully without J . Lapetina 's 
accountants) , run a deficit free transportation 
service, or affect the local academics even 
more fa vorably. 

My point is that the AS governmental 
structure, particularly the presidency, has a 
tremendous potential only infrequently 
dreamed about (could that possibly be due to 
inept AS officers? ) I The students at this 
University need a couple of tremendous 
presidents to realize some true power progress. 
Cutting the salaries of the AS officers is NOT 
the way to discover the leaders we need so 
badly. Cutting the salaries is not goi ng to cure 
our ill-fated beaucracy by allowing only 
bourgeois WASP 's to serve. 

As it works now, the AS president must study 
like hell , commit himself diligently (hopefully ) 
to AS affairs, and chase dollar bills to survive. 
Time is the essence of the problem. NO student 
has the time to administer the AS affairs 
properly, chase greenbacks, study, and live. 

A Superhuman President 

We need an excellent president. No. we need a 
super human president to run our 
minigovernment. It is my contention that we 
will not find an energetic, successful AS council 
without eliminati ng their financial problems 
(loans might be a viable alternative ). Salary 
reduction would compound the present 
difficulties of our commune. 

r beseech you voters to see beyond the 
mediocrity of our present AS organization. 
Wholeheartedly. I admit that a government 
which fears referendums is bad . A government, 
which votes itself salaries contingent upon 
attendance. is embarassingly recognizing the 
apparent fact that some present AS officers 
would shirk their duties . Why might 
conscientiously motivated officers even 
consider the contingency? 

The AS government is bad. Don' t make it 
worse by reducing the AS sa laries. 

Do Not Fold~ Spindle or Mutilate 
V. Robert All~n, MD 

... So you go ahead and call this big guy a 
crook and he belts you one in the chops. As you 
get up [rom the dust you discover : (l J you have 
suffered a loss of digni ty ; (2) your big mouth is 
rapidly developing a fat lip; (3) you're in PAIN. 
baby. Query : what do you do? (Oh, I forgot to 
tell you-you 're in Tanzania for the summer, 
and your local , friendly Student Health Service 
is only 12.256 miles away. 

Life being what it is. we all suffer bruises. 
charley horses, and assorted sprains, strains, 
and spasms from time to time. We see a lot of 
them at the Student Health Center. but maybe it 
would be helpful for you to know how they are 
treated and why. just in case you can 't get to us 
right away the next time. 

A bruise. or contusion is the result of part of 
your anatomy coming into sudden contact with 
a hard object, i.e., shin with coffee table. eye 
with fist . or rump with pavement. Bleeding 
occurs under the intact skin. and you quickly 
experience pain and swelling or a black-and-
blue mark, or both. 

Some particular contusions are so common 
that they have been dignified with special 
names. A slone bruise occurs on the ball of the 
foot from coming down hard on something while 
running. ([f you come down hard on your heel . 
you may develop, appropriately, a heel bruise.) 
When you bark your shin, you may get a bone 
bruise, which is bleeding between a bone and its 
periosteum, the thin , Saran wrap-like material 
that covers the bones. The charley horse (an 
obscure term of baseball origin) is a contusion 
or tear of some of the fibers of the quadriceps. 
the big front thigh muscle. 

"Very educatlonl," you mutter. "but wltat 
do I do lor ~e paia?" The answer is : 
cold- immediate application of something cold 
to the injury. The sooner you can apply an 
icebag or something simllar, the quicker will be 
the relief. Cold numbs and also constricts the 
blood vessels of the area, helping to control the 

bleeding. Just remember not to freeze the 
injury by leaving it in ice too long. 

H the contusion is in a compressible area . 
such as an extremity. the next step is to wrap it 
up with a compression dressing to help hold 
down the swelling. Elastic bandage is best, but 
any broad strip of cloth can be used. (Save your 
old panty hose, girls! ) Remember not to make 
your compression dressing so tight it 's a 
tourniquet which cuts off all circulation to an 
arm or leg- just firm . comfortable pressure. 

Finally, elevate the extremity and let it rest. 
Prop up your leg or put your arm in a sling. 

Cold is applied , on and off, for the first 24 to 48 
hours. By then, the bleeding should be 
controlled and you 've had all the bleeding 
you 're going to get. Many times that 's the total 
trea tment, but if the area is large and there has 
been a lot of swelling we sometimes suggest a 
complete about-face after 48 hours and begin 
treatment with heat. This might be hot packs. 
soaking in warm water. Whirlpool, linament. 
infrared, diathermy, or any other ingenious way 
of getting heat to the injury but avoiding burns. 
The idea now is to iacrease circulation in the 
area. so that the clotted blood can be 
reabsorbed as quickly as possible. Supportive 
elastic bandages may be continued as long as 
there is swelling. and activity can be resumed 
as soon as it is no longer painful to move. 

Uncontrolled swelling from a contusion may 
develop into a hematoma, which is a large 
collection of blood in one area under the skin. It 
is sometimes necessary for a doctor to aspirate 
one of these with a needle to relieve the 
swelling. This is usually done. for example, 
when you get your ear smashed as in wrestling. 
Failure to empty out thp ~welling may result in 
defonnity of the ear cartilage. known as 
cauliflower ear. 

In the next column. I'll continue with sprains 
and strains. (Bet you don't know the 
difference. ) 

A Report From Indochina 
Margaret Rossoff 

During the first week in April , six women from Laos, North 
Vietnam and South Vietnam met in Vancouver, British 
Columbia, with representatives from the women 's movements 
in Canada and the United States. 

.The Indochinese women described the effects of war in their 
countries and Cambodia. Civilian villages are routinely 
attacked. Citizens are forced into concentration camps, where 
many deaths are caused by lack of medicine and food . Old 
people are killed ; parents are forced to abandon their children; 
women are raped and forced to be prostitutes. Young men are 
drafted into the puppet army . Horrible mutilatirms and pain 
are caused by pellet bombs and napalm ; the land is devastated 
by toxic defoliants . One woman, who had spent six years in 
prisons run by the Saigon regime, described the tortures she 
had experienced . ' 

Despite this suffering , the Indochinese women reiterated 
their determination to fight until victory is achieved. "Greater 
aggression can only lead to greater resistance." 

"Government Aggression" 

The Indochinese women realize that the war is being 
directed by the United States government. not the American 
people. They pointed out the contradiction between Nixon 's 
words and his actions. remarking that he won the last election 
with deceptive promises of peace. Believing that the 
American people are also suffering from the war and desire 
peace. they stressed the need to publicize the conditions in 
Indochina. " If the majority (of Americans ) knew these 
crimes. they would demand a quick end to the war ." 

The Indochinese are hoping for a resurgence of American 
anti-war activity. embracing the largest possible segment of 
the population, and based on the following three demands. 

0) That Nixon set a date by which time immediate and 
unconditional troop withdrawal will be completed ; 

(2) That the United States government cease supporting 
puppet regimes; 

(3) That the Indochinese be allowed to settle their own 

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Apathetic Faculty 
Editor : 

Your article of April 9. 
entitled "Convocation on Muir 
Requi rements Proposed. " 
accurately reflects the apathy 
on the part of the faculty which 
has hampered the successive 
attempts of the Muir College 
Co uncil to i mprove 
undergraduate education at 
John Muir College. The great 
majority of faculty members 
fi nd themselves hard-pressed 
to offer any constructive 
cri ticism on proposal s 
submitted - but what can be 
expected of a group of persons 
who don't bother to show at 
their own meetings? 

For nearly two years the 
Muir College Council. which is 
made up of six students and 
(offic ia lly) six faculty 
members, has been working on 
a series of recommend a tions 
designed to bring better 
education to Muir and a new 
vitality to the .crumbling Muir 
curriculum. Perhaps these 
proposals aren't the "perfect 
panacea Â·' for all our ills here at 

--

Muir, but they are a beginning. 
Meanwhile the Muir Faculty 
has been and continues to be 
content to simply let the 
general educa tion of Muir 's 
students slide downhill while 
they devote themselves 
e ntirel y to s pecific 
departments and priva te 
research. 

It is time for adm i ni strators 
to take a hard. critical look at 
the strangle-hold maintained 
by the faculty over general 
education programs of the 
colleges. Now is an especially 
important time in light of 
President Hitch's recent 
directives co nce rning 
improvement of undergraduate 
education at the University of 
California . 

The students of Muir have 
shown themselves interested in 
and devoted to the bettering of 
education at their college. Shall 
their work through the Muir 
College Council come to naught 
becau e of the apathy of Muir 
Faculty members? 

Very sincerely.

Member 

Muir College Council 

affairs in peace. 
The Indochinese wowen advocated using all tactics that will 

unify the anti-war movement and allow the largest possible 
number of people to express their support of these demands. 

"Scapegoats" 

The Indochinese women realized that the American people 
do not necessarily support the war ; "young Americans are 
scapegoats." But the war is the responsibility of the Ameri ca n 
government. To call for mutual troop withdrawal is 
Impossible ; it is as if a robber entered a house and demanded 
that the homeowner leave first . Where are the Vietnamese to 
go? The unity of Vietnam was stressed. The Indochinese 
women pointed out that if Philadelphia were attacked it would 
not be unreasonable for troops from New York and California 
to join her defense ; this is analogous to the situatwn in 
Vietnam. The divi ion of {he country into North and Sou th was 
arbitrary and originally temporary. 

Since it is the United States government which is the 
aggressor, the Indochinese women declared. responsibility for 
the suffering of all Americans and Indochinese affected by the 
war- including the responsibility for the imprisonment of the 
POWs-lies with the American government. The Indochinese 
women stressed that the American people are in their minds 
dissociated from the government. " It is the ixon 
administration which sows death and destruction to our two 
peoples. We are friends." 

During the next few weeks there will be many opportunities 
to justify the faith of the Indochinese women by participating 
in the antiwar offensive: the April 24 march. the May 2 
festival . the May 5 strike and Bank of America picket. and he 
May 15-16 GI weekend . 

A fuller report on the Vancouver conference. including tapes, 
will be presented Monday, April 26 . at 8:30 in the Revelle 
informal lounge. The following day "The Battle of Algiers" 
will be shown at the Unicorn Cinema as a benefit to pay the 
costs of transporting delegates to the conference. 

A Modest 
Proposal 
Editor. 

When one reflects upon the 
functions of the AS presidency. 
one is immediately struck by 
the dichotomy between the 
qualifications for the office and 
the candidates ' conceptrons of 
these qualifications. Often, the 
aspirants' conceptions are 
completely unrelated to the 
realitie of the posi tion. 

The president is required to 
have a n accurate 
understanding of the nature of 
his powers. He must be able to 
perceive situations, weigh 
alternatives. and act quickly 
and decisively. He should 
recognize the strengths and 
weaknesses of his opposition, 
and behave in a manner that is 
neither overly cautious nor 
exceedingly reckless. He must 
be adept at bluffing. and have 
the ability to exploit chance. 

The discerning observer will 
note immediately that 
proficiency at the game of 
poker demands these same 
characteristics. It is therefore 

, 

apparent that the present 
method of selecting a president 
(meaningless campaigns by 
inept candidates ) is 
inadequate, and that a more 
appropriate method readily 
lends itself. 

The president by this new 
method would be chosen 
through a school wide poker 
tournament. and would assume 
office upon demonstrating that 
he is UCSD's fi nest poker 
player. We feel that this 
method would be more 
equitable. meaningful and 
realistic, and would in ure the 
ascendency of the most 
qualified person to office.

Dogs and Shit 
Dear Gianna 0 curo. 

After reading your semi-
mediocre article entitled 
"Dogs and Shit ," I thought I'd 
waste a little of my time and 
write this respon e to you. 

I congratulate you on having 
enough human digmty to dump 
your shit into the ocean where 
it can kill off ~he life there 
instead of on the grass. bushes, 
etc. \ like dogs do) where it I 
returned to the soil. 

I agree with you that 
avoiding dog shit is pretty 
tricky. especially if you go 
arou nd with your nose up in the 
air . 

I also agree with you that 
dogs are mostly love 
surrogates. In fact , I myself 
prefer them to some people, I 
cannot. however, agree with 
you that living thing like dog 
should be kept locked up at 
home.

Forming an 
Alternative Government 

Greg Rus ell 
In response to the upcoming AS elections, which have in the 

past proved themselves untenable as a method of selecting 
officers. we as members of the UCSD community sugge t a 
major change in the AS electoral procedures. We have 
discovered that nearly every member of the UCSD community 
who has heard of the plurality electIOn proposal views It as 
more viable and desirable than the existing structure. 

The plurality is a po itive way to ehmmate manufactured 
"issues and charismatic office seekers by !l1aking everyone a 
candidate. One would not be forced to arbi trarily choose 
between "the better of six evils." Tho e who are the most 
responsive to others would ultimately be elected because each 
person would vote for fr iends or acquaintances that were the 
best qualified to his own knowledge Those elected would thus 
be elected on their merit and on the confidence they inspired in 
others, not because of the quality of their campaign. 

Our proposed system Â·of voting would be for each VOler to list _ 
seven people he honestly believed to be qualified. sign his 
" ballot'Â· and turn it in at one of the deSignated polling booths on 
campus. The names would not be re tncted to s.ullents -
anyone who was a worker . student. faculty member or in any 
other way a part of the UCSD community would be qualified to 
vote and be elected. The ballot would be tallied and then 
publicly burned . The seven people receiving the most votes 
would win. and if any declined the post the person with the next 
highest number of votes would be elected The organization of 
the council itself would be left up to the elected 
repre entatives. 

We propose, then. that both types of elections be held next 
week and that the AS Council accept the procedure which has 
the most support. Last year's restructurmg of the CounCil 
shows that uch a sudden change can take place. 

If the AS Council will not accept this proposal, then we will 
independently hold an alternate election . Last year only 30 
percent of the students acknowledged the A Council by voting 
in the elections. If this is any indication of what should happen 
this year (and we believe It is ). then we feel the level of 
upport that has already been shown for the plurality system 

makes it possible that it would receive more recognition from 
the students than the pre ent elections. And. this wou ld raise 
the serious question of which government reflected the wt.ll of 
the people.

Hel'bie Hancock 

Miles Davis ' young piano 
prodigy during his heavy years, 
Herbie Hancock, is out kicking 
on his own now. Saturday night 
Hancock will steam into the

Hancock was a member of 
Davis' more prolific quintets 
and quartets during the sixties, 
writing himself such keystones 
as "Cantaloupe Island" and 
" Maiden Voyage. " Many 
critics feel that the avante-
garde genius of Hancock was 
eclipsed and subdued by the 
powerful Davis. They are 
looking forward to an explosion 
from the still youthful Hancock 
since his break with Davis.

In its continuing Showcase 
for Young Composers, the 
UCSD Music Department will 
present a second concert in 
April of new works by graduate 
students. It will be held at 8: 30 
p.m., Saturday , April 24 , in the 
Recital Hall , 409MC and is free

Dwight Cannon, coordinator 
of the concert and whose work, 
" Music for I, 2 or 3 Trumpets 
and 4-Channel Tape," will also 
be performed that evening, 
says the concert will be 
informal and that the usual 
concert format will not be 
used . Improvisations will be 
done between the musical 
pieces to be performed, and the 
audience should feel free to sit 
in the chairs provided or on the 
floor and may walk ,around

Ethnopoetics 
Reading 

Armand Schwerner, poet and 
important figure in the new 
avant-garde , will give a 
reading at the UCSD Art 
Gallery on Monday , April 26, 
'lt8 :30p.m. 

Schwerner is welJ-l<nown as 

an experimental poet whose 
most extreme work takes him 
back to the beginnings of 
written history, 

In a long work called ., The 
Tablets" he creates a religious, 
erotic , visionary, comic 
universe on the model of the 
fragments of Mesopotamian 
epics and ferti lity hymns 
uncovered by archaeologists 
over the last 100 years. 

His reading is one of several 
public performances sponsored 
as part of UCSD's Ethnopoetics 
Seminar being taught by 
Jerome Rothenberg, poet and 
Regents' Professor in the 
Department of Literature. In 
addition to Rothenberg and 

Sch werner, other poets in the 
series include Simon Ortiz 
(April 23) , Emmett Williams 
(May 3) , and Dick Higgins 
(May 19).

UCSD Wins. 7-5 

Tritons Outslug Biola 
Regents OK new GYM . 

John Zoller 
Staff Writer 

The $650,000 addition to the UCSD 
gymnasium, given preliminary approval by the 
Regents last Friday , will provide relief to 
serious overcrowding in existing physical 
education facilities. Tentatively scheduled for 
completion by Fall 1972, the annex will contain a 
full-size basketball court , office and workshop 
space for UCSD recreation clubs, a staff 
women 's locker room to accommodate four 
instructors, and a 1,500 square foot conference 
room and kitchenette complex. 

" We didn 't ask for everything we'd like," said 
Bert Kobayashi , UCSD director of recreational 
athletics, " because we realized that if we bit off 
more than someone thought was reasonable, we 
might get shot down on the whole project. " 

regulation basketball court, but will also break 
down into two intramural sized volleyball or 
basketball courts . 

Roller Skating Possible 

" The tartan surface will be much more 
versatile and durable than hardwood," said 
Kobayahsi , "people will even be able to roller 
skate on it." . 

The addition will serve other needs, as well . 
The staff women 's locker rooms will mean the 
growth of women 's physical education 
prograrns. The office and workshop space will 
encourage the development of recreation clubs 
on campus. 

Location of the new gym is tentatively 
planned for the south side of the existing 
faci lity. Although the Regents approved 
construction of only 12,000 feet of assignable 
floor space, Kobayashi is hopeful that the new 
structure will have two stories. 

Behind Pete Yocky 's six-hit, 
12 -s trikeout pitching 
performance and an II-hit 
attack, the UCSD diamondmen 
posted their seventh win of the 
season Tuesday by defeating 
visiting Biola College of La 
Mirada , 7to 5. 

A six-hit first inning got the 
Tritons off to a 4-0 lead, but it 
was Steve Shepherd's two-out , 
sixth inning home run over the 
left-centerfield fence that 
broke a 5-5 deadlock and 
provided the margin of victory. 
The 375-foot drive was 
Shepherd 's third homer of the 
season and increased his RBI 
total to a team-leading 20 . 

For the day Steve (.3771 
scored three runs and had three 
hits in five trips to the plate, 
including a first-inning double 
that scored lead-off batters 
Curtis Jenkins (.264 ) and Dave 
Wright (.271), who had 
slammed out consecutive 
singles off Biola pitcher Jim 
Wright. In that first inning. 
George Horman (.319) drove 
Shepherd home with the first of 

his two hits for the day and 
scored when Chuck Bahde 
(.229 ) stroked the first of his 
two singles. 

Biola. a hustling ballclub. 
scored its initial and only 
earned run of the afternoon in 
the second inning on a walk and 
two singles, interspersed 
between two deep drives to 
centerfielder Wright which 
opened and closed the inning. 
Yocky's second of the 12 
strikeouts accounted for the 
second out , following the walk 
and first BIOla hit. In the Triton 
fourth , Shepherd singled with 
two out, went to second when 
Jerry Pittman 1. 241 ) walked , 
and after advancing to third on 
a wild pitch came home when 
Horman lined his second Single 
of the afternoon. 

What appeared to be a 
comfortable lead shrank to a 5-
4 margin in the fifth inning 
when Biola capitalized on a hit 
batter, errors bv left fielder 
John Shinn (. 295 and 2-4 for the 
day ) and Yocky. and a sacnfice 
fly to score three runs . In the 

visitor half of the sixth, 
thirdbaseman Shepherd threw 
wild after charging a bunt. 
allOWIng the runner to reach 
second, A single through the 
hole at short then tied the 
contest and set the stage for 
Shepherd 's retaliatory blow 
three outs later . Alert base 
running by leading hitter Ron 
Bush 1.404 1 added an insurance 
run for the Triton in the 
seventh inning. After striking 
out on a wild pitch, Ron 
streaked to first when the Biola 
catcher failed to control the 
ball. He then proceded to steal 
second . go to third on another 
wild pi tch . and score when the 
throw following Bahde's 
grounder to short pulled the 
Biola firstbaseman off the bag. 

The Tritons, now 7-9 for the 
year. will attempt to reach the 
.500 mark Sa turday when they 
meet Cal Lutheran at the UCSD 
diamond. Guy Lowery (3-1 , 
ERA L.44 1 and Yocky (3-2, 
ERA 1.54 ) are scheduled to 
pitch the two seven inning 
games starting at noon. 

With the University facing a critical shortage 
of capital expansion funds , it seems a minor 
miracle that the project got off the ground at 
all . Kobayashi - credits extreme need and a 
willingness to compromise for success so far. In 
order to get approval for the annex , campus 
officials agreed to forego a much larger 
women 's gymnasium called for in the campus 
master plan by 1973. " We knew we'd never get 
anything if we held out for that, '. said 
Kobayahsi. 

Since a regulation basketball court requires 
8,400 square feet , this would mean creation of a 
building with 16,800 feet of floor space, about 
4,000 more than the Regents budgeted for . " If 
we can do it for about the same money. " 
Kobayashi said, ' 'I'm sure the Regents won 't 
mind." 

ew, Old Structures Linked 
Softball Epidemic Termed Critical 

All-Purpose Recreation Facility Needed 

The most despera te need, Kobayashi said , 
was for a newall-purpose recreation facility. 
Scheduling in the present gym is almost 
intolerable, he explained . In the Winter 
Quarter. [or example, when 50 intramural 
basketball teams were competing for playing 
time, the gym 's tight schedule could afford only 
two days a week for the program. As a result , 
intramural matches were scheduled from the 
earliest available hour through midnight on both 
days. The remainder of the week, regular 
intercollegiate basketball, volleyball , fencing 
and wrestling teams competed for game and 
practice time, along with an assortment of 
drama, concert, and movie productions. 

The fact that the gymnasium has the only 
large seating capacity on campus compounds 
the problem, said Kobayashi. This past 
weekend, for example, a two!day fencing meet 
forced a much later than usual showing of the 
Friday night flicks at 10 p.m. Further , all the 
equipment for the fencing meet had to be taken 
down before the movie, and then carefully 
replaced afterward for the continuation of the 
contest the next day. 

The next annex will go a long ways toward 
solving this kind of problem. The 94- by 50-foot 
tartan playing surface will be able to 
accommodate fencing , wrestling or volleyball 
meets, while another production is going on 
next door . The new floor will be the size of a
