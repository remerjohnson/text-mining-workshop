MEN'S  WATER  POLO

No. 6 Tritons Perform 
Perfectly in Pool Play

The formerly No. 8 UCSD men’s water polo 
team finished 2–2 this past weekend in the annual 
SoCal tournament held in Westwood, California. 
Within the pool of participating teams, which in-
cluded the majority of the nation’s top ten teams, 
the Tritons finished an impressive sixth place out 
of 16 schools to jump to a No. 6 national ranking.

UCSD’s first matchup required six additional 
minutes to determine the winner, but the Tritons 
emerged victorious with a score of 8–7 against 
No. 9 UC Irvine in a tight game. 

UCSD senior utility David Higginson was 
able to come through for his team when it mat-
tered the most, scoring two clutch goals, both in 

the second overtime. With less than a minute left 
in the game, Higginson scored the equalizer to tie 
up the game at seven each. Seconds later, in what 
might have been the Triton’s final possession, 
Higginson was able to find that back of the net 
again to steal game one. 

“This morning’s game was super entertain-
ing—a very physical game that at times felt more 
like a group MMA match,” UCSD head coach 
Denny Harper told the UCSD Athletics Depart-
ment. “[The team showed] great resilience, to be 
down one going into the final overtime and out-
score them 2–0.”

Mammoth Mountain Ski Area 
announced on Sept. 24 that it 
acquired Big Bear Mountain Resorts 
and Snow Summit Mountain Resort 
in Big Bear Lake for $38 million. 

In addition to already owning 
Mammoth Mountain and June 
Mountain, Mammoth purchased 
438 acres of skiable land controlled 
by the U.S. Forest Service, along 
with a golf course, a driving range 
and multiple parking lots on 140 
acres of private land. 

In its press release regarding the 
acquisition, Mammoth Mountain 
announced a new season pass, 
the Cali4nia Pass, which grants 
passholders unrestricted access to 
all four mountains. The Cali4nia 
Pass costs $689 for adults and went 
on sale on Sept. 27.

Bear Mountain and Snow 
Summit are Southern California’s 
largest and most popular ski and 
snowboard resorts. They employ 
about 1,600 people during the 
height of the snow season and 
attract nearly 800,000 visitors every 
winter. Now with the transaction, 
Mammoth as a whole expects to 
draw 2 million visitors per year to 
all four resorts.

However, due to a comparatively 
low snowfall of only 35 inches last 
winter, Big Bear attracted about 
100,000 visitors less than its usual 
amount. Mammoth expects the 
number to grow towards the average 
of 100 inches of snowfall in the 
future.

Outdoor Leadership Coordinator 
of UCSD Outback Adventures 
Simon Teale told the UCSD 
Guardian that it is too early to tell 
whether or not this would affect 
Outback Adventures’ future trips to 
Big Bear. However, he said that it is 
unlikely that it will have much of an 
impact, if any, on future trips.

When Mammoth Mountain 
bought Mammoth Mountain and 
June Mountain, they installed high-
speed lifts and created a downtown 
village area filled with shops, bars 
and high-end rental condos. Many 
are expecting them to enact the 
same level of development on Big 
Bear.

Inland economist John Husing 
said in a Sept. 24 Press Enterprise 
article that it will be important 
for Mammoth to invest in the 
offerings in the area, particularly 
for conventions. He explained that 
although the mountain economy 
usually has a fairly strong winter 
season, its lack of full-scale hotel 
resort facilities lead to a mediocre 
summer season. This deficiency 
inhibits the area from capitalizing

UNIVERSITY  CENTERS

No Word Yet on PC Starbucks Timeline
Questions regarding the chain’s Free Trade status remain as UCEN prepares for franchise.

See ENTERPRISE, page 9

University Centers has remained 
largely quiet about recent allegations 
of Fair Trade issues amidst plans to 
open a Starbucks in Price Center 
West. 

After an 11-4-0 vote by the 
University Centers Advisory Board 

that occurred during Fall Quarter 
2013, it was recommended to 
University Centers by the Advisory 
Board to pursue a site license to 
open a Starbucks on the first floor 
of Price Center — in the place most 
recently occupied by Cafe Espresso 
Roma. However, the university has 
not yet made any announcements 
regarding a target open date for the 
coffee shop chain’s PC West location.

The business plan with Starbucks 
originally began when Java City Eco-
Grounds, previously a contender to 
replace the failing Espresso Roma, 
was determined to have failed to 
meet the fair trade criteria required 
by university guidelines. The UCSD 
Guardian previously reported that 
only a portion of the coffee Java City

New Special Committee on Enterprises Will Meet Weekly in its Inaugural Quarter 

AVP Enterprise Operations 
Austin Peters issued a general call 
for volunteers from A.S. Council 
to join his newly restarted Special 
Committee on Enterprises on 
Saturday, Oct. 11. According to 
its charter, the committee aims to 
evaluate both the current status 
and future expansions of A.S. 
Enterprises.

Co-chaired by Peters and current 
A.S. president Robby Boparai, the 
six-member committee will meet 
at various points throughout the 
year and provide regular updates 
to the rest of A.S. Council. It 
works within the larger Office of 
Enterprise Operations, which 
maintains the campus’s three main 
enterprises: A.S. Lecture Notes, A.S. 
Soft Reserves and the new Triton 
Outfitters. 

This quarter, the committee 

plans to convene every week 
until Week 8. Many of these 
meetings will be open to public 
input. However, the finalized 
recommendations will be made 
in closed meetings, as dictated by 
the committee charter’s guidelines.  
    According to Peters, he saw a need 
for A.S. Council to become more 
cognizant of the three enterprises. 
Over the previous years, it has 
been operating with little oversight, 
leading to systemic issues and 
revenue deficits. 

“The goal of Enterprises is to 
make investments that make money 
for the A.S. budget so we can be 
less reliant on student fees,” Peters 
told the UCSD Guardian. “But if 
the enterprises run a negative, then 
they, in essence, have to be bailed 
out by the Associated Students.” 

Over the summer, Peters and 
his office began piecing together 
the current fiscal situation of 

Enterprises, finding tens of 
thousands of dollars in debt between 
the three businesses. He has since 
been trying to raise awareness 
about these issues in A.S. Council 
in order to rally enough support for 
an official mandate to address them. 

The special committee will first 
focus on short-term solutions to 
bring the enterprises out of debt. 
Peters said that one possibility was 
combining A.S. Lecture Notes, A.S. 
Soft Reserves and Triton Outfitters, 
as they are separate entities at the 
moment. He later added that the 
committee would probably meet 
through multiple quarters to address 
Enterprise Operation’s overall role 
at UCSD.

“I think we need to ask the bigger 
question: Are [the Enterprises] 
something that’s going to make 
money in the future? Are these 
businesses aligned to be in a market 
that we can have a niche in?” Peters 

said. “I mean these enterprises used 
to make hundreds of thousands of 
dollars for the A.S. budget a year.”

The committee’s long-term goals 
would thus be to evaluate the viability 
of the three businesses and whether 
to simply classify them as services, 
without profit mandates, or to end 
them altogether. According to Peters, 
it will also handle any new enterprises 
that may arise in the future, since last 
year’s winning slate, Tritons Forward, 
had heavily emphasized planning 
new Enterprise action during the 
campaign.

“What I plan on doing is 
submitting a memorandum of 
understanding for the actions of the 
Enterprise office,” Peters said. “I’m 
going to do my best because I think 
Enterprises is a great tool for the A.S. 
experience.”

University Centers has remained 
largely quiet about recent allegations 
of Fair Trade issues amidst plans to 
open a Starbucks in Price Center 
West. 

After an 11-4-0 vote by the 
University Centers Advisory Board 
that occurred during Fall Quarter 
2013, it was recommended to 
University Centers by the Advisory 
Board to pursue a site license to open 
a Starbucks on the first floor of Price 
Center — in the place most recently 
occupied by Cafe Espresso Roma. 
However, the university has not yet 
made any announcements regarding 
a target open date for the coffee shop 
chain’s PC West location.

The business plan with Starbucks 
originally began when Java City Eco-
Grounds, previously a contender to 
replace the failing Espresso Roma, 
was determined to have failed to 
meet the fair trade criteria required 
by university guidelines. The UCSD 
Guardian previously reported that 
only a portion of the coffee Java City 
sold was properly certified.   Due to 
this, not all Java City Coffee was able 
to be sold on campus, which meant 
that it was not a viable tenant option 
for UCSD’s Price Center.

However, starting this quarter, 
Java City Eco-Grounds has been 
Housing Dining and Hospitality’s 

primary source of coffee — replacing 
Starbucks as the most immediate 
provider. The coffee can be found 
in any HDH-run market and dining 
hall. The new partnership has left 
many UCSD affiliates to speculate 
whether Java City has either been 
properly certified by the university 
or is continuing to be sold on 
campus without verification. HDH 
declined to comment and University 
Spokeswoman Christine Clark told 
the Guardian that she was not able 
to speak to the paper on behalf of 
University Centers. 

In a Starbucks statement released 
before Fall Quarter 2014, company 
representatives wrote that the brand 
follows the “stringent Fair Trade 
Policy on campus by sourcing 100 
[percent] of its coffee and tea products 
through fair trade certified or Coffee 
and Farmer Equity Practices verified 
by Conservation International labels.” 

However, since C.A.F.E. Practices 
are a body that receives funding 
from Starbucks, equal verification is 
considered biased by many experts. 
Therefore, this might potentially 
violate the mission of UCSD’s fair 
trade advisory committee and make 
it illegal for Starbucks to be served 
on campus. 

HDH Sustainability Manager and 
Econaut Natalia Herret explained 
in an over-the-phone interview that 
bringing in Starbucks is an example 

of how big business dominates the 
sphere of commerce and prevents 
small business growth. 

“The student population is blind 
to the truth regarding the lack of 
quality in Starbucks drinks,” Herret 
said. “There’s a hype to the brand that 
clearly overwhelms young people to 
the point of paying excessive amounts 
of money for what is ultimately 
unhealthy and processed.”

Whether or not Starbucks will be 
bringing in revenue for University 
Centers or displacing revenue 
towards oncampus food services is 
unknown. 

A.S. Council AVP Environmental 
Justice Advocacy Affairs Sierra 
Donaldson explained that allowing 
Starbucks to sell non-Fair Trade coffee is 
not true to the intentions of the students 
that voted to pass the Fair Trade Policy.

“Students advocated for UCSD’s 
Fair Trade Policy because they decided 
that ethical consumerism is worth the 
slightly higher cost and brand strictness,” 
Donaldson said. “In my office’s research, 
we have found that Starbucks lacks 
many of the stipulations required by 
Fair Trade, including the community 
development incentives, the living wage, 
the zero tolerance for harmful chemicals 
and the clearly segregated third party 
verification model.”

 A Guide to 
Ensuring You 
Surpass the 
Freshman 15

With all the residential dining halls and mar-kets on our campus 
and the slew of outside ven-
dors that occupy Price Center, 
we UCSD students have quite a 
few food choices at our fingertips. 
Remember freshman or transfer 
orientation, where they take you 
on a tour of all those places and 
then subsequently remind you that 
you also have multiple gyms and 
athletic facilities to take advan-
tage of? Yeah, that’s all bogus. Eat 
away! Let’s be real: The best part 
of college is the food. All those 
years you spent listening to your 
parents and eating all the veg-
etables on your plate and going to 
daily sports practices are over. The 
time has come to not only gain the 
Freshman 15, but to surpass them! 
We’re here to teach you how. 

Step one: Increase your caloric 
intake at least twofold. Just walking 
to classes here basically counts for 
all the workouts a student could 
ever need. In fact, getting around is 
so much work that it justifies eat-
ing five meals a day, plus snacks. 
Dining dollars are your best friend, 
and procuring food has never been 
easier! With dining facilities every-
where, it’s a simple process: Walk 
in, swipe a burrito or two and grab 
a blended coffee with extra caramel 
while you’re at it. 

Step two: Definitely agree to 
all roommate requests to go to 
Goody’s, John’s or Roger’s at mid-
night. These outings are perfect 
opportunities to alienate all of the 
people you live with, ensuring that 
you’ll never make friends with any 
of the people you live with. Satisfy 
any and all cravings that you might 
have, no matter how disgusting 
they might sound. Hummus and 
Oreos? Not unheard of. Wings and 
Cool Whip? Go for it. Barbeque 
potato chips and Ben and Jerry’s 
Chunky Monkey? That’s the best of 
them all. And of course, don’t for-
get that hot chocolate with whipped 
cream on your way out. You 
wouldn’t want to get cold on the 
two-minute walk home, of course.

Last but not least, step three: 
Avoid the gym at all costs. 
Everyone knows that if you get 
within a hundred feet of RIMAC, 
Main Gym, Canyonview or Spanos, 
you’ll instantly shrivel up and fail 
all your midterms and finals for 
the rest of forever. These places are 
horrible, rank dungeons of misery 
where nothing good will ever hap-
pen to you. And heaven forbid 
someone try and make you take a 
rec class! Those things are reserved 
only for overly enthusiastic, fun-
loving instructors and strange 
people who actually want to try and 
stay in shape. 

If you follow all these steps 
without fail, you will most defi-
nitely accomplish your goal. The 
Freshman 15 will be knocking at 
your door in no time, followed 
quickly by its buddies, the stress-
eating seven and the finals five. 
Good luck, and may you be lazy, 
lethargic and completely out of 
shape in no time at all! Next time, 
look out for: How to fail all your 
midterms!

UCEN’s Break Down
University Centers’ mishandling of  the Che Cafe issues is yet another example of  

the administration failing to prioritize students on campus.  
ILLUSTRATION BY ELYSE YANG

The embattled Che Cafe is back in court this week to fight an increasingly inevitable eviction order from the university. But the Che’s roots as an activist organization, 
coupled with the university’s covert efforts to hand the collective 
its walking papers, have turned a renter’s dispute into a courtroom 
siege. 

When it was founded in 1980, the Che captured the turbulent 
spirit of an era where campuses fostered student activism and 
distrust of the establishment. But the Che failed to adapt itself to 
an increasingly commercialized system, leaving it now at odds 
with an administration that’s eyeing progress and its bottom line.

The Che Cafe’s battle with the university sheds light on UCSD’s 
identity crisis as both a center for innovation and a 50-year-old 
campus full of art and diversity. But the administration’s callous 
treatment of the campus institution demonstrates a disregard for 
transparency and campus culture that may color its dealings with 
student organizations for years to come.

When the University Centers Advisory Board withheld 
funds from the Che last spring, a limited amount of public input 
was allowed, but the decision was ultimately made in a closed 

executive session. UCAB representatives even proposed and 
seconded motions to limit the voice of the public. The Che met 
a similar environment at the Graduate Student Association’s 
decertification meeting in which they were not allowed any input 
in the decision and were told quite frankly that students didn’t 
care about them. 

The hush-hush way in which the Che was shut down is highly 
disconcerting in a system that’s already accused of problems with 
transparency. To move to decertify the Che without notifying 
the collective, let alone the student body, hardly gives students a 
chance to mount a defense for the campus institution. It sends a 
message to other student organizations that they will be dealt with 
swiftly and without input from the community.

Even if the university’s allegations that the Che has violated the 
Master Space Agreement by not paying its rent hold true in court, 
failing to address the community on the issue is inexcusable and 
sets a poor precedent for other organizations.

Facing closure, the owners of the Che developed a contingency 
plan with support from local businesses. The university refused 
to consider these plans unless the collective agreed to vacate

Graffiti Art Park Gives Campus an Artistic Escape

Students returned to campus last fall to find their beloved Graffiti Hall painted over by 
the administration. The hall, once 
an underground, creative outlet for 
free speech, had been located in a 
covert spot in Mandeville Center 
and provided an intimate setting for 
students to express themselves. The 
administration not only painted over 
the entire artwork, but also installed 
cameras in the area to spook any 
potentially eager artists. 

However, within one year, 
members of A.S. Council, along 
with administrators and University 
Centers, have collaborated to create 
a new space for students to express 
their creative freedom. On Monday, 
Oct. 13, University Centers opened 
Graffiti Art Park between Porter’s 
Pub and Mandeville Auditorium. 
We commend former A.S. President 
Andy Buselt and A.S. representative 
to the Campus Planning Committee 
Kyle Heiskala for working with the 
administration to find a new loca-
tion that is both safe and allows for 
the same amount of creative expres-
sion. Seeing the University change 
from a mindset that involved taking 

down Graffiti Hall without any input 
to creating a space that students are 
genuinely excited about is certainly a 
happy surprise and quite a relief. 

During the General Elections 
of Spring Quarter 2014, students 
overwhelmingly voted favorably for 
a non-binding referendum, which 
asked students whether or not they 
supported a new graffiti art space. 
Although the referendum held no 
guarantee from the University any 
new art installation would be put in 
place, the efforts of campus admin-
istrators and student leadership that 
were able to create Graffiti Art Park 
by the beginning of this quarter are 
particularly noteworthy. 

UCSD is known for being 
science-oriented, and having an art 
space that is open to the public for 
any passerby to see diversifies the 
University and beautifies the cam-
pus. The park is open to everyone, 
including students, alumni, faculty 
members and outside visitors. This 
provides a unique edge that is inclu-
sive, which creates an organic feel 
to the park and allows a release of 
positive, artistic expression from the 
artists. 

However, it is clear that with this 
freedom also comes responsibility. 
The park has several guidelines that, 
if fail to be followed, might lead to a 
removal of the space. The guidelines 
entail keeping the paint only on 
the boards and not on any trees or 
buildings, respecting other students’ 
art and the views they express, shar-
ing the community with others and 
throwing away used paint cans in a 
special bin. Along with this, indi-
viduals are able to file complaints on 
the park’s website if they feel like the 
guidelines are being disrespected in 
any way. 

Graffiti Art Park is a pilot proj-
ect and not a permanent fixture. 
Therefore, it is up to the students to 
develop the norms and expectations 
of the park and to hold it to a higher 
standard than Graffiti Hall. Keep in 
mind that the boards will be repaint-
ed to a white canvas at the start of 
each quarter. This is not a negative 
action,  but exists simply to provide 
a fresh start as the year progresses. 
We look forward to seeing the beau-
tiful art created and have no doubt 
that the park will be respected by all 
artists and passersby.

the space, a move that would have 
interrupted the very stream of revenue 
that could help the cafe pay down 
their debt. 

Furthermore, as we saw with 
the Crafts Center and Graffiti Hall, 
once students leave a space, it’s 
unlikely we’ll ever get it back. In 
each of those cases, the university 
acted without taking into account 
student culture by shutting down 
the spaces while students were 
away from campus. 

Whether the Che will have a 
place on campus beyond this year 
remains to be seen. But the ongoing 
issue is how the administration 
should handle other student 

organizations that are at odds 
with their policies. While the 
administration has a right to enforce 
its rules, it would behoove them to 
remember that they’re dealing with 
students, not seasoned businessmen, 
and perhaps exercise some flexibility. 

Other campus co-ops have found 
themselves in similar situations 
as the Che, facing unpaid bills 
and the wrath of the university. 
It is not unprecedented that the 
Che would have been able to dig 
itself out from a mountain of debt, 
given that a majority of the other 
co-ops were eventually profitable 
enough to pay their rent and their 
employees. It is, however, impossible 
without collaborating with the 
administration. 

The fight for the Che is more 
than a fight for mismanaged 
concert space that’s allegedly failed 
to pay its rent. In its actions, the 
administration has indicated it favors 
the new and the profitable at the 
expense of student input on student 
organizations. Losing the Che means 
losing a symbol of student activism, 
which, ironically, may be the thing 
that saves it in the first place.

But looking ahead doesn’t mean 
— quite literally — paving over the 
past. The value of the Che Cafe is 
certainly not in its dismal profit 
sheets but in its status as a student-
run organization, which adds more 
cohesiveness and diversity to the 
campus than any administrative 
initiative ever could.

LETTER  TO  THE  EDITOR

Dear Editor,
   I found the article titled “The 
Magic of Coding,” which was 
published on Oct. 12, particularly 
interesting and insightful. While 
I certainly commend Handley’s 
efforts to involve younger students 
in coding, I can’t help but wonder 
why the game design — which fea-
tures survival games, the manipula-
tion of the elementals and multi-
player duels — so overtly targets 
males. The game CodeSpells is very 
similar in both name and task to 
the popular Minecraft, which by 
general online consensus is mainly 
played by males, not females.
    This past year, I have been an 
active member of the robotics team. 
At the beginning of the summer 
meetings, there was a pretty even 
ratio of males to females, but as the 
summer wore on, the number of 
females quickly dwindled away to 
our current team of nine males and 

four females. Only two females are 
involved in the coding aspect of the 
robotics team; the other two, myself 
included, became the designated 
builders.
   My intention in relaying this brief 
anecdote is not to argue that coding 
is “better” or more mentally taxing 
than building, or vice versa. Rather, 
I want to point out that even after 
extensive advertising on our part, 
the number of female coders 
remains resolutely at two. After 
reading this article, I can’t help but 
wonder if this gender inequality in 
coding could be caused by differ-
ences in early interaction with tech-
nology. If more computer games, 
especially those such as CodeSpells, 
target boys, then males will develop 
a natural inclination towards tech-
nology and eventually dominate 
fields such as computer science. 
Perhaps Handley’s next project 
could address this gender inequal-
ity by featuring a game design that 
is more female-inclusive.

Evolution 
of  Passion:
R&B Un-
dersound

Rhythm and blues began as a 
moniker for urban music aimed at 
African-Americans but quickly ex-
panded to include elements of electric 
blues, gospel and soul. After Michael 
Jackson’s infusion of this style into 
the language of popular music, R&B 
has been something of a powerhouse 
ingredient, ruling the radio and recog-
nized in the world for its flexibility and 
emotional resonance. It seems fitting 
then to explore a lesser-known side 
of this widespread genre and to give 
credit to those who continue to push 
for growth.
A/T/O/S – With very little informa-
tion available about the duo’s origin 
or identity (names given as Amos and 
Truenoys), “A Taste of Struggle” is rep-
resented exclusively by a stark brand 
of R&B. Their work stretches itself out 
between the soft sway of backbeats 
in a wash of melody, drawing upon a 
wide spectrum of electronic and mini-
malist hip-hop to make its melancholy 
way. Vocalist Amos delivers a stunning 
performance, settling easily among 
the stops and starts. What really sets 
A/T/O/S apart is an innate love of 
subtlety and restraint; like leaning 
in for a whispered confession, quiet 
conviction holds a stunning power 
that we can often forget. Tracks to Try: 
“Roses,” “Cosmos,” “Projects”
James Blake – In spite of appearing 
on critics’ lists year after year and 
winning a Barclaycard Mercury Prize 
for his latest album, London native 
James Blake is something of a hidden 
gem. With a stellar, soulful voice and 
a knack for earnest introspection, 
Blake has all the qualities of an R&B 
giant — but it’s his lush and eclectic 
composition that steals the show. Each 
track warps through dissonance and 
warmth, polyrhythmic percussion and 
blooming piano twist around to arrive 
at some truly spectacular melodies. 
Not all of it sits prettily, but it cuts such 
an angular mood that one can’t help 
but take note. At a time when most 
“stars” don’t even produce their own 
music, Blake makes his mark from 
the first chord. Tracks to Try: “Life 
Round Here,” “The Wilhelm Scream,” 
“Retrograde”
SOHN – Making his home in Vienna, 
Austria, SOHN — also known as 
Christopher Taylor — is only just 
beginning his career in earnest. Where 
others build a somber and slow R&B, 
SOHN’s music is a busy thoroughfare 
of shimmering melody and rolling 
bass. The inherent spaces between 
each beat glow with ethereal vocal 
samples, and even the “blues” facet 
of the genre seems utterly charged 
with new life. This life is owed in no 
small part to a comfort with exploring 
and unfolding a synth line or swell. 
SOHN’s vocals mirror this perfectly, 
with an unassuming grace that lets 
each track rise behind him organically 
while demonstrating his impressive 
range. Where others would bring 
heaviness, SOHN only basks in the 
light. Tracks to Try: “Artifice,” “Veto,” 
“The Wheel”

Evidently, this genre’s involvement 
in the homogenous influence of popu-
lar culture has done nothing to im-
pede its evolution. With the growing 
following of artists like The Weeknd, 
we see to some extent a willingness to 
embrace these shifts in style. But to 
me, this speaks of what R&B is at its 
core: a passionate engagement with a 
vocalist and an ever-shifting palette of 
sound. It morphs so well because it is 
individual by nature, and that kind of 
singular attention is something to be 
respected.

MUSICAL   REVIEW

BY  TEIKO  YAKOBSON  CONTRIBUTIING WRITER
Comedian Steve Martin and singer-songwriter Edie Brickell weave together a gripping American 

tale of the tenacious bonds of family and childhood love at the Old Globe Theatre.

The average person is familiar with Steve Martin’s comedic act-ing in hit movies like “Cheaper by the Dozen,” but not many know that he also holds brilliant skill as a writer and a country 
musician. This fall, Martin is wielding both those talents alongside 
alternative-rock singer-songwriter Edie Brickell to bring an exhila-
rating new musical to the Old Globe stage. “Bright Star,” an early 
20th-century period piece, paints a 
warm, nostalgic picture of the South all 
while admonishing its misguided faith 
in strict, traditional values over human 
compassion and creativity. To complete 
the classic Southern picture, every mo-
ment of this intriguing story is set to the 
tune of genuine American bluegrass.

It may seem like an unlikely play-
writing duo, but Martin’s intricate story-
telling and Brickell’s poignant music go 
hand-in-hand to present a well-rounded 
musical that easily entertains the audi-
ence with its sophisticated characters, 
moving plot and amusing comedy. The 
story seamlessly bounces back and forth 
between 1923 and 1945 as it tumbles 
through the unsightly past of literary 
magazine editor Alice Murphy (Carmen 
Cusack) and connects her to Billy Cane 
(A.J. Shively), a bright, young veteran 
who bursts into her office with his heart 
set on writing for her magazine. With-
out leaving any damaging clues along 
the way, Martin and Brickell success-
fully build up to a shocking twist that is 
well worth the wait.

Cusack masterfully propels her 
performance through Alice’s tragic 
story with convincing, full-bodied 
expressions of pain that command 
emotion from her viewers. Out of all 
the cast members, her Southern accent 
is the most genuine and impeccable, 
both in dialogue and in song, giving 
her vocals a warm and rich quality that 
is pleasantly reminiscent of the Dixie 
Chicks. Her impressive vocals grace 
many songs, but the most noteworthy 
numbers are those in which Cusack is 
accompanied by other characters and an ensemble to create vibrant 
harmonies that melt the ear like butter to cornbread.

Other remarkable characters outside of the leading quartet include 
the show’s comic relief Daryl Ames (Jeff Hiller) and the main antago-

nist Mayor Dobbs (Wayne Duvall), who respectively invoke undeni-
able laughter and bitter distress with their engaging stage presence. 
Hiller successfully transports the “sassy gay friend” stereotype back 
70 years and delivers an equally comical act of relentless tongue-in-
cheek wit. Duvall is also astounding for his commitment to his cold 
disregard toward those he deems obstacles for his ambition, even in 

moments that require him to scream out 
in sheer insanity.

When challenged with representing 
an authentic folk genre like bluegrass, 
musical director Rob Berman does not 
allow his band to fall short: Banjo, guitar, 
bass, violin and cello are only a few of 
the sounds that bring a necessary pop to 
the orchestra. Not only are the musi-
cians expected to perform on stage while 
dressed as extra country folk, but they 
even interact with other members of the 
ensemble. A most notable moment was 
an endearing bit of flirting between a 
Southern maiden and the banjo player 
while he plucked away at his instrument.

Set designer Eugene Lee works magic to 
accomplish less with more, all starting with 
a toy train that chugs across a track at the 
very top of the stage to mark the open-
ing scene of Billy’s journey. Much of the 
background is comprised of the theater’s 
actual backstage walls, which Lee fashions 
into appearing as the front of a house with 
actors walking through the backstage door 
as though it were the front door.

While the quality and composition of 
the songs performed is spectacular, the 
limited range of music style presented 
could be a setback to some audience 
members. Within the realm of bluegrass, 
“Bright Star” presents a medley of high 
energy songs that effectively pull at the 
heartstrings with every pluck of the banjo, 
but in the end, it’s still bluegrass; if that’s 
not a preferred genre for the listener, then 
it’s difficult to fully appreciate the experi-
ence.

“Bright Star” celebrates those who 
have chosen to follow their heart, even 

when it leads them down an unconventional path. The Old Globe’s 
performance is worth a trip down to Balboa Park, especially for 
anyone who holds an affinity for country music or would like to try 
something unconventional as well.

Everyone is familiar with the 
classic Dracula mythos: the vampire 
that emerges from his coffin and 
sucks the blood from the veins of his 
victims. During his tenure, he rose to 
the top of Halloween’s monster ros-
ter, appearing in countless films since 
the 1920s. With “Dracula Untold,” 
Universal Pictures hopes to pump 
the blood back into a monster that 
has been making money for almost a 
century, this time giving him a mea-

sly PG-13 rating and an unnecessary 
origin story. The result is a film in 
which the audience is the real victim 
of a new, unscary vampire who has 
fallen from his status as the most vil-
lainous of Halloween monsters.

The Hollywood formula of taking 
a timeless story and attempting to 
make it more epic is the recipe for 
“Dracula Untold.” The film’s title is 
meant to elicit the idea that there 
is more to the story of the classic 

vampire, when in reality, this prequel 
has almost nothing to do with the 
monster we all know and fear. This 
story, along with so many of Hol-
lywood’s epic retellings, should have 
remained untold.

“Dracula Untold” is directed by 
Gary Shore, a novice director who 
had previously directed only televi-
sion commercials and is the screen-
writing debut of duo Matt Sazama 
and Burk Sharpless. Unsurprisingly, 
the movie has “amateur” painted all 
over it. The film relies mainly on its 
star, Luke Evans (Bard from “The 
Hobbit” trilogy) and a rather large 
endowment for computer-generated 
imagery, most of which was probably 
used on an inordinate amount of 
bats.

The latest iteration in the Dracula 
franchise tells the origin story of 
Vlad, a Transylvanian prince who, 
in order to save his people from 
the invading Turks, makes a deal 
with Caligula, the Master Vampire 
(Charles Dance, best known as 

Tywin Lannister from “Game of 
Thrones”), to gain the latter’s powers. 
If Vlad can resist the urge to drink 
human blood for three days, Vlad 
will return to his former human self; 
if not, he will become a vampire 
forever. This Faustian bargain should, 
in theory, focus on the themes of 
the inability to escape fate or play 
out like a story of surrendering to 
darkness. The problem is that Vlad is 
only seriously tempted to succumb a 
couple of times throughout the film, 
none of which are truly compelling. 
Additionally, the film’s short run 
time of 91 minutes doesn’t give the 
character enough time to make a 
convincing transformation from light 
to dark. Instead, the film plays out as 
a formulaic superhero origin story, 
as Vlad is given powers (albeit fairly 
exciting ones, like controlling bats, 
super strength, speed, self-healing 
and night vision) in order to protect 
his cliche family: a young son, 
daughter and beautiful blonde wife. 
Vlad is painted as a romantic, tragic 

superhero who will be disappointed 
to learn that the name “Batman” is 
already taken.

Perhaps “Dracula Untold” was 
only meant to be a medieval action 
flick, coasting off of Hollywood’s new 
obsession with the high Middle Ages, 
including other lackluster retellings 
of classic stories like “Maleficent.” 
Instead of epic battles, Shore tortures 
us with uncomfortably close-up, 
shaky, video game-like action scenes 
involving Vlad overwhelming hordes 
of Turks. At times, it can be fun to 
watch this over-the-top action, but 
unfortunately, it lacks any tension or 
suspense since our superhero Vlad 
is so invincible. There is one clever 
scene in which the enemy Turks 
exploit Vlad’s vulnerability to silver, 
but as it turns out, Vlad’s greatest 
weakness is that he was never meant 
to be a superhero.

FILM   REVIEW

A simple idea in a complicated 
world is a dangerous thing. More 
often than not, great movements and 
sudden shifts in perspective are ignited 
by uncomplicated yet beautiful new 
thoughts. The idea that sets “Pride” 
into motion is simply an expression 
of kindness. The year is 1984, and 
the U.K. is in the midst of a national 
debate over a miners’ strike that has 
the workers at the brink of starvation. 
On the eve of a gay pride march, Mark 
Ashton (Ben Schnetzer), a young 

and charismatic activist, watches a 
news report on the miners’ precarious 
condition. Having experienced 
mistreatment and abuse himself as a 
member of the lesbian, gay, bisexual 
and transgender community, Mark 
has the “radical” idea to get gays and 
lesbians to raise money for the miners. 
Why the miners?  Because he feels like 
it. “Pride” does not attempt to develop 
Mark’s underlying rationale. He is 
moved by solidarity — and that’s more 
than enough for him.  

He forms the Lesbians and Gays 
Support the Miners group and rapidly 
encounters opposition from all fronts. 
Some activists within the LGBT 
community, understandably, believe 
to have their hands full already. They 
question Mark’s priorities and opt out 
from the group. More importantly, 
the National Union of Mineworkers 
refuses to be helped by a group of 
homosexuals. But Mark and his 
friends would hear none of them. 
They randomly pick a small miners’ 
town in South Wales and decide to 
bring them the money in person.

What could have been an over-
the-top drama is, in the hands of 
stage director Matthew Warchus 
(“Simpatico”) and writer Stephen 
Beresford (“The Last of the 
Haussmans”), an uplifting dramedy 
clean of empty sentimentalism and 
facile moral preaching. It is easy 
to be carried away by the film’s 
cheerful atmosphere and clever 
jokes. But behind the laughs and the 

friendships, lurking in the back like 
a cold shadow, lies the tragedy of a 
generation marked by the reality of 
AIDS and social ostracism. Death 
is a passive-aggressive character in 
“Pride”: quiet for the most part, but 
devastating in its appearances. As 
the story develops, the film gradually 
draws us into the conflicts and 
contradictions in the protagonists’ 
inner lives.   

Beresford’s script does not 
hide away individual drama. An 
affecting scene shows Joe (George 
MacKay), the photographer of the 
group, confronted by his parents 
who have just discovered their son’s 
homosexuality. We see them yelling 
and gesturing while Joe quietly cries. 
Warchus doesn’t let us hear the 
conversation; we are left alone with 
the images — the frightful images 
of a family disintegrating before our 
very eyes.

“Pride” successfully depicts 
a series of unexpected events 

which reveal human dignity and 
companionship as real possibilities, 
both personally and collectively. 
The summer of 1984 saw a group of 
people determined to overcome the 
bigotry and ever-present violence of 
a blatant homophobic society — a 
society that, just a decade earlier, 
officially considered homosexuality 
a mental illness. The success in the 
miners’ community should remind 
us of our contemporary failures to 
create a culture that not only respects 
but also embraces differences in 
sexual orientation. “Pride” is about 
simple ideas — the fact that they 
remain as radical and far-fetched 
today as they were in the 1980s is an 
alarming sign of moral stagnation. 
If nothing else, “Pride” is a mirror 
where we see, reflected into the 
screen, our deepest prejudices and 
our desire to overcome them.

CONCERT   REVIEW

PHOTO COURTESY OF US VERSUS THEM 

As one of 12 triple-threat 
contenders on “The Glee Project,” 
Bryce Vine has come a long way 
from his short-lived moment on 
the screen, proving that his last-
place rank was just the first of many 
opportunities to break through 
the industry. Since then, he has 
done numerous gigs, notably for 
pop duo Karmin. But now, with a 
top-100 album under his belt titled 
“Lazy Fair,” Vine rocked the end of 
his national Trendsetter Tour by 

kicking off his last performance at 
UCSD’s The Loft.

Before Vine hit the stage, 
UCSD’s own new hip-hop and 
rap group took the opening 
act. Introducing themselves as 
Lightyears Ahead, the trio of 
students kick-started the night 
with some much-needed energy 
and proved their capabilities 
in delivering quick raps. Their 
performance lacked the necessary 
background instrumentation that 

certainly would have amped up the 
energy; fortunately, soulful band 
Super Groupie managed to provide 
just that. With lead singers on 
guitar, a drummer, a saxophonist 
and a trumpet player, Super 
Groupie slowed down the night for 
a nice half-hour of jazz music — a 
change in tempo seemed displaced 
in a concert permeated with rap 
music, but their talent was so 
remarkable that they were a natural 
choice to perform before the star of 
the night.

When the room settled for 
a slight second, Vine — who 
was dressed as casually as the 
audience — hopped on stage and 
commanded attention. He jumped 
straight into his setlist; it wasn’t 
until the second song that he 
introduced himself.

What Vine was most known for 

on television were his pop covers; 
since then, his musical genre has 
diversified to a blend of original, 
organic music that he has made 
his own. His personal style of 
combining the rhythmic melodies 
of pop and dropping a swift beat 
in rap transposes directly on stage. 
Backed by his disc jockey, Skizz 
Marquee — who seems just as 
passionate, rocking out as he skids 
a finger against the vinyl — Vine’s 
music has an eclectic arrangement 
of sounds that synergize well 
with his speedy lyrics. There are 
electronic jangles of an electric 
guitar and beats, trumpets, steady 
drum rhythms and claps recorded 
on the vinyl that give it the vibe of a 
radio performance gone live.

With high-energy, fast-paced 
performances like “Where The 
Wild Things Are” and “Sour Patch 

Kids,” it’s apparent how much 
Vine connects with his music. He’s 
charismatically jumping all over 
the stage and on the equipment, 
reaching out to his fans with 
confident enthusiasm and letting 
himself loose. Listening attentively 
shows why he’s so ardent about 
his own music: It’s about having a 
good time. But with the majority 
of the audience jamming out and 
swarming around the stage, it was 
apparent that they took Vine with a 
great reception as he cracked a few 
snarky jokes and met some of the 
screaming fangirls in the audience. 
Tame as The Loft is during the day, 
artists like Bryce Vine prove that 
venue doesn’t matter as long as the 
energy is in the performance.

hungry  ghosts
by OK  go
Release Date Oct. 14

Despite uninspired lyrics, exceptional sonic 
choices and creative genre-bending push the 
veteran rock band back into relevance. 

ALBUM  REVIEW

It must be rough to be OK Go, a pop-rock band that peaked in 2007 with a viral music video 
featuring the musicians dancing on 
treadmills to “Here it Goes Again,” 
one of its less-than-memorable 
tunes. Its following 2010 album re-
lease “Of the Blue Colour of the Sky,” 
which was 
experimental 
and had a 
poor choice of 
singles, went 
comparatively 
unnoticed. 
Sixteen 
years into its 
career, the 
Chicago band 
has taken to 
PledgeMusic 
to fund its 
latest effort, “Hungry Ghosts.” Expec-
tations sufficiently lowered? Good. It 
will be even easier to appreciate how 
tight and fresh its newest collection 
feels.

On the first listen, it’s nearly 
impossible to focus on anything but 
the instrumentation because the 
varied and dense production is so 
engaging. “Hungry Ghosts” explodes 
to life with a bombastic opener, “Up-
side Down & Inside Out,” packing 
everything but the kitchen sink into 
its wild, upbeat, synthesized beats. 
Driving the song, the vocals glitch 
and skip around in the choruses, cre-
scendoing into lines like, “Don’t-on’t-
on’t stop-op-op, can’t-an’t stop-op/ 
It’s like a freight train.” “Obsession” is 
another highlight, sonically taking a 
page from the Backstreet Boys’ play-
book but pumping everything with 
sex and cowbell. In fact, almost every 
track has something novel to offer, 
from the chirpy violin lines perme-
ating “Bright as Your Eyes” to the 

creepy “game over” electronic sounds 
in the verses of “The Great Fire.”

It would be a shame for someone 
to pay close attention to the lyrics, 
however, because they don’t stack 
up to the thoughtful arrangements. 
While mostly far from terrible, it 
seems that a band of late-30-some-

things 
shouldn’t ever 
be moan-
ing about 
relationships 
as if they’re 
still hormone-
wracked high 
schoolers. 
“The One 
Moment,” 
the only true 
throwaway 
track, opens 

with the lines, “There’s nothing more 
profound/ Than the certainty/ That 
all of this will end/ So open your 
arms to me.” “Hungry Ghosts” is 
primarily pop music, and the themes 
don’t need to be thought-provoking, 
but the album’s adequate lyrics are 
marred with occasional eye-rollers 
like these.

To say that “Hungry Ghosts” is 
pop music is just a best approxima-
tion, though. While certainly incor-
porating pop, “Another Set of Issues” 
struts with hard funk and minimalist 
electronic beats. “I Won’t Let You 
Down” dips into disco, and the 
closing track, “Lullaby,” is a mostly a 
cappella, cool-down lap. But the flow 
of the album moves confidently for-
ward, never cluttered or confused by 
its diversity. Despite some lackluster 
word choice, OK Go has released a 
sharp, eclectic collection of music by 
anyone’s standards.

CLUB SPORTS

Baseball: Club baseball travelled to Whittier, California to open up their fall 
campaign against Cal State Fullerton on Saturday. Using five pitchers in game 
one, the Tritons allowed one run over seven innings with two walks. Timely 
hitting by Tyler Pollack Robert Young and a solo dinger from Jack Lombardi 
secured a 7–1 victory for the Tritons in the first game of the double header. 
Fullerton responded from the mound in game two, holding UCSD to one 
hit and leading the Titans to split the series. UCSD sees action again this 
Saturday, Oct. 18 against USC.

Sailing: The club sailing team hosted the UCSD Open Regatta last Saturday 
at Mission Bay. The sailors raced a simple course with one weather mark and 
one leeward mark, with both A and B divisions competing. Wind conditions 
were inconsistent but steady enough to keep races going into the early eve-
ning. However, racing was limited the following day due to poor conditions. 
Triton freshman and sophomore teams ended the regatta 17th, 21st and 24th. 
As for the UCSD open field, the teams finished 5th and 8th out of 12.

Field Hockey: The Tritons faced off against the USC Trojans this past week-
end, but with a player down and no opportunity for substitutions, the team 
stood severely outmatched. The Trojans were first on the board, but UCSD 
recovered as Zoe Montaya tipped a quick goal in off of an assist from Mitchell 
Keith. Lindsey Sager put another in with a hard shot to the back boards soon 
after. However, by the end of the first half the Trojans were up with a 6–2 
lead. The Tritons emerged in the second half newly determined and poised to 
take advantage of the ball speed and field spacing of the Moorpark complex. 
Unfortunately, however, they failed and suffered a 10–2 loss.

Women’s Soccer: UCSD women’s club soccer met UC Irvine in their first 
action of the 2014 season on Saturday. The team struggled to get up to 
speed, letting in one goal within the first five minutes. Throughout the first 
half, UCSD dominated possession but was unable to tie the score. However, 
the Tritons eventually broke out in the second frame. Laurel Bowling scored 
the first goal for UCSD with a volley at the back post off a cross from Kelley 
Mitsumori. Monica Cuevas crossed to Abby Chin who headed in goal two. 
Freshman Kelly Weldon scored with an unstable shot and Gabby Ley scored 
a curving shot from the end line for the final score of 4–1. 

Looking for their second win and a chance to secure their place at 
Regionals, UCSD met UCLA the following day. Mitsumori got the ball out 
wide on the left flank and got a beautiful cross off to Weldon, who scored 
and gave the Tritons a 1–0 lead. UCSD was able to hold the Bruins for the 
duration and pulled out the victory.

the first was marked as an own goal 
by the Pioneers. Just 17 minutes into 
the first half, Bashti took a shot that 
rebounded off the goal post and 
then again against a defender and 
into the right corner for the first 
goal of the game. 

Bashti repeated in the 68th 
minute, this time off an assist by 
sophomore forward Sam Palano. 
Defensively, the Tritons held the 
Pioneers to just four shots overall 
while still producing 12 of their own 
on offense. 

“We’re playing really well as an 
entire team,” Bashti told the UCSD 
Athletics Department. “If you look 
at the score sheet, it’s not just one or 
two guys that are up there, so we’re 
doing exactly what we need to do 
offensively.”

After this weekend, only five 
regular season games remain for 

UCSD before the postseason begins. 
The next action for the Tritons will 
be on Friday, Oct. 17 at Cal State 
Monterey Bay as UCSD begins a 
season-long, four-game road trip. 
Winning on the road will be critical 
for UCSD’s CCAA playoff hopes, 
as the Triton’s third place seat is far 
from guaranteed. 

“We’re not really thinking of 
[playoffs] right now,” Pascale said. 
“We’re really focusing on [Cal State] 
Monterey Bay and taking it one day 
at a time.”

Tritons Head on Four Game Road Trip as Regular Season Closes
▶ M. SOCCER, from page 12

Josh Stiling also finished the game 
with two goals. Senior goalkeeper 
and Western Water Polo Associa-
tion Co-Player of the Week Cameron 
Ravanbach finished the game with 14 
saves. 
     In its second matchup of the day, 
UCSD was defeated by perennial 
powerhouse, No. 1 UCLA. The Tritons 
scored at least once in every quarter 
but allowed UCLA to score at least 
three goals in exchange. Stiling again 
finished the game with two goals while 
David Higginson’s younger brother, 
freshman utility Thomas Higginson 
scored one.
      After a night’s rest, the Tritons were 
back in the pool the following day to 
take on No. 6 UCSB and No. 5 Cal 
State Long Beach.
      In the opener on day two, UCSD 
pulled off a dominating upset victory 
over UCSB, defeating the Gauchos 
9–4. The Tritons displayed a stellar 

defensive performance, limiting No. 
6 Santa Barbara to only four goals 
and shutting them out in the fourth. 
Ravanbach’s defensive awareness was 
strong as usual, and he finished the 
game with 10 saves.
     “We played obviously one of our 
best games of the year against UCSB,” 
Harper said. “[It was] a great defensive 
effort to only give up four goals to a 
team of that caliber.”
       Despite the thrilling win, the 
Tritons could not maintain their high 
level of play in their final game of the 
tournament, falling to No. 5 Cal State 
Long Beach 11–10 late in the game. 
The Tritons were just short of coming 
through with another upset victory. 
        UCSD had a 9–6 lead with a little 
over a minute left in the third but 
could only notch one more score to 
the 49ers’ five. In the midst of the Tri-
tons’ offensive struggles, Long Beach 
was able to slowly cut the lead to tie 
the game halfway into the fourth and 

eventually take the match.
       “Long Beach is a [legitimate] fifth 
ranked team and we had them on the 
ropes but couldn’t finish them off,” 
Harper said. “All and all, however the 
weekend was good and we should 
move up in the national rankings.”
       Stiling led the game with five goals 
while Ravanbach had seven saves on 
the defensive end. 
       Despite the split, the Tritons put 
up a solid performance at the tourna-
ment, with some expected wins and 
a surprising upset, ultimately keeping 
in stride with the best of the nation. 
After a strong weekend, the Tritons are 
currently 8–8 overall and 3–0 in the 
Western Water Polo Association. 
       With the hopes of another sell-out 
crowd, the Tritons return home on 
Friday, Oct. 17 as they take on league 
opponent California Baptist University 
at 6 p.m

Tritons Undefeated Over Weekend
MEN'S  SOCCER 

UCSD Ties Against Stanislaus, Shuts Out Cal State East Bay
BY JOHN STORY ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR // PHOTOS BY KELSEA BERGH

Homecoming weekend brought a draw and a win for UCSD men’s soccer last Friday and Sunday, 
respectively. Friday night’s game against Cal 
State Stanislaus ended in a 1–1 tie and the 
Tritons bested Cal State East Bay on Sunday 
to improve their record to 9–3–1 overall and 
4–1–1 in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association. UCSD now has 13 points in 
the CCAA and is currently in third place 
overall.

Cal State Stanislaus entered Triton 
Soccer Stadium on Friday with a scoreless 
streak, one that was broken with 10 minutes 
left in the first half. The goal, the result of a 
free kick earned by the Warriors, came from 

freshman Rafael Chavez, marking the first 
goal of his collegiate career. 

UCSD answered in the 62nd minute 
when another freshman, winger Sean 
Pleskow, booted one past Warrior goalkeep-
er Clint Long from the penalty spot. Long’s 
goal marked the last tally of the game, as 
both teams went scoreless in overtime. 

“I give our guys a lot of credit to get that 
goal,” UCSD Head Coach Jon Pascale told 
the UCSD Guardian. “It was a well-orga-
nized offense. They don’t give a lot of free 
looks. They just kind of fought and fought 
and fought until it came. I was really happy 
with the resilience of the guys.”

While UCSD was outshot during both 

regulation and overtime, senior Brandon 
Bauman took a career-high six shots on 
the evening. By failing to produce in extra 
play against the Warriors, UCSD maintains 
a 0–1–1 record in overtime contests on the 
year. 

“I thought that was really a hard-fought 
game by both teams and probably a fair 
result,” Pascale said. “You obviously would 
love to walk away with a win, but I thought 
it was a pretty even game.” 

Both of the goals in the Triton’s 2–0 win 
over Cal State East Bay were contributed by 
sophomore forward Malek Bashti, though 

MEN’S TENNIS

Freshmen Show Strong Play at UCSB
All Tritons finish in top ten of singles and doubles, first-years display promise. 

While most freshmen were accli-
mating during their first weekend at 
college, freshman Alexandre Miaule 
was dominating up north in Santa 
Barbara during the three day UC 
Santa Barbara Classic. The newcom-
er showed poise in collegiate com-
petition, finishing third in singles 
play, while fellow freshmen Justin 
Zhang and Eric Tseng placed fourth 
in doubles. 

“The experience our freshmen 
gained this weekend is tremendous 
as they were able to see a high level 
of play,” UCSD head coach Tim-
mer Willing told the UCSD Athlet-
ics Department. “Being around our 
returners with their committed and 
competitive efforts shows [us] ex-
actly what needs to be done to be 
successful.”

On Friday, Tseng handily won 
two matches, both 6–1, against 
Fresno State’s Evan McIntosh, and 
Miaule beat UC Davis’s Tommy 

Lam in three matches. Both fresh-
men qualified for the champion-
ship bracket that Saturday. Zhang 
and Tseng took their Friday doubles 
match 8–5 against UC Riverside, 
advancing to the championship 
bracket. 

Saturday held more success 
for the Tritons, starting with two 
comeback victories for senior Mark 
Meyer. Meyer went down the first 
match 3–6 against Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo’s Naveen Beasley but fired 
back with two straight 6–4 and 6–3 
set victories. Again demonstrat-
ing tremendous fortitude, Meyer 
beat Grand Canyon University’s 
Felix Schueller after losing the first 
match 4–6. 

“Mark is highlighting why he is 
successful in his unwavering will-
ingness to compete every single shot 
of every point,” Willing said. “This 
example is invaluable for our fresh-
man.”

Miaule won twice against Cal 
Poly’s Jordan Smith but was pre-
vented from entering the cham-

pionship match by Fresno State’s 
Youssef Hassan. Zhang and Tseng 
lost 8–5 in their matchup against 
Grand Canyon, relegating them to a 
third-place match, where they ulti-
mately fell by a narrow 8–7. 

On Sunday, Miaule recovered 
from the previous day’s loss and 
beat Cal Poly’s Devin Barber to win 
third place. Tseng earned sixth in 
the singles, while Meyer ended up 
ninth. Every Triton placed within 
the top 10 against strong teams and 
strong competitors.

“We had some good results,” 
UCSD assistant coach Tavi Popalu-
ca said. “As the season goes on, we 
will need to get all players to have 
consistent outings in order to make 
an impact on our year.”

UCSD will next compete in the 
SoCal Intercollegiate Champion-
ships in Los Angeles from Wednes-
day, Oct. 29 through Sunday, Nov. 
2.
