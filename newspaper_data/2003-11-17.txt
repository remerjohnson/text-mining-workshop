Icohol and drug violations

number of reported sex offen es 
and homicides remained at zero 
from 2000 [Q 2002, according to 
the annual Clery Report published 
last month by campus security 
officials. 

federal law titled "Jeanne 
Clery Oi closure of Campus 
Security Policy and Campus 
Crime tati tics Act of 1998" 
requires institutions of higher 
learning to prepare and di tribute 
an annual report regarding cam-
pu crime tatistics and security 
mea ures. 

The UCSD Annual Campus 
Security Report is made available 
to all tudcnts and employees, cur-
rent and pro pective, 0 they are 
informed about the level of crime 
and ecurity in the campus envi-
ronment.

ov. 17, his advisors and aides will 
propose different strategies for tack-
ling the California 's multibillion-
dollar deficit and how to balance the 
states budget. According to a Los 
Angeles Tmusarticle on Nov. 14, sug-
gestions include a possible $20 bil-
lion bond as well as possible cuts to 
mental health programs and higher 
education. 

According to the Tmus article, 
the Schwarzenegger team has con-
sulted with everal institutions about 
the possibility of securing a bond 
that could be used for the current fis-
cal year to payoff past debts for 
bonds ruled by the court as illegal. 
The loan would include a mandato-
ry spending cap. 

the- surrounding area has actually 
grown safer over the years. 

"This campus is at the higher 
end of safer places to live," Cresap 
said. 

The Clery Report contains 
crime statistic that have been 
reported to campu security 
authorities panning the past three 
years. All depicted crimes have 
taken place ei ther on campus, in 
off-campus bu ildings, property 
owned or o perated by the 
U niversity of California, o r on

public property adjacent to the 
campus. 

The numbers of non-arrest 
disciplinary referrals involving 
drugs and alcohol made by the 
UCSD Police Department and by 
other campus authoritie com-
bined have steadily increased. 

There were 87 drug-related 
incidents in 2000, 118 in 2001 and 
130 in 2002. There were 757 alco-
hol-related occurrences in 2000,

loan would prevent additional cuts 
to the education system and buy 
some time to address budget issues. 

"This would postpone mas ive 
cuts on education right now," 
DeMaio said. "There are a number 
of inefficiencies in education and 
the University of California and 
community colleges would have 18 
months to assess their budget, 
renegotiate with staff and cut 
through red tape." 

Some UCSD professor who are 
following the different propo als for 
the budget agree that a loan would 
bnng positive short-term results. 

"The loan would probably be 
good for students III the short run," 
polirical sCIence professor Gary 
Jacobson aid. "Othenvise, cuts in 
funding for higher education would 
result in more fee increases, more 
crowded classrooms and delays in 
completion of required courses." 

However, some say that in the 
long run, it would bring negative 
outcomes and in turn affect pro-
jects that would benefit education. .

Asian: Bill would give $30 
million to universities 
continued from page 2

The bill has garnered significant

sorship by 16 members of 
California' congress. The districts 
of tho e sponsoring include many of 
California's largest universities, 
including UC Berkeley, tanford, 

UCLA, UC Santa Cruz and USC, 
ali of which would stand to benefi t 
from the legislation. Absent from

who is currently at a conference in 

an Francisco, was unavailable for

Bond: Schwarzenegger to 
propose budget Nov. 18 
conrinued from page I 

an assistant professor of government 
"Borrowing our way out of th.is fiscal 
year means that cuts to higher educa-
tion and fee increases can be avoided 
with a sufficiently large bond, but the 
problem is that states can only carry a 
certain amount of debt." 

According to Kousser, a bond 
would affect capital improvement 
ince the state uses its credit to cover 

projects such as building schools. 
"In the long term, since 

California ... has credit limits for 
higher education, this means that we 
won't be able to build new campuses 
from bonding," Kousser said. "The 
more bonds the state takes, the high-
er the interest, so you can't ju t bor-
rowan infinite amount of money." 

Representatives from institu-
tions that were approached for 
advice by the governor's adminis-
tration said the loan could be a way 
for chwarzenegger to offset the 
statc's projected $10 billion deficit 
for thc coming year and to avoid 
further cuts. For some, it is also a 
way for the new governor to keep 
his campaign promise of avoi ding 
any tax hikes and rescinding the car 
tax increase. 

"The major issue is the cash bill 
crisis," DeMaio said. "You have two 
choices: Make immediate reforms 
and have reductions now - and 
most of those would probably be 
service reduction - or buy yourself 
some time to reduce." 

IIowever, a representative from 
the Howard Jarvis Ta xpayers 
As ociation, another organization 
that has been consulted by 
SchwarLenegger aides, said that a 
loan would come with conditions 
and should be used only to cover ille-
gally obtained loans by outgoing 
Gov. Gray Davis. 

"We are not considering a pro-
po al for additional debt, but to 
replace debts that already exist and 
that were obtained illegally," sa.id 
HJTA Executive Director Kris 
Vosburgh. "We sure arc not advo-
cating a $20 bil lion additional loan." 

chwarzenegger is expected to 
present his budget proposals to a 
special session in the California State 
Legislarure on Nov. 18. According 
to the Las Angtla Trmes, he is likely 
to bring the bond and the spending 
cap before voters in March 2004 and 
would need legislative approval by 
Dec. 5.

Graduation rates on the rise 
UC, UCSD record greater retention 
By SHANNON EUm 

Contributing Writer 

More UC students are graduat-
ing in less time, according to an 
annual report fil ed by the 
University of California. Despite 
unprecedented enroll ment 
growth, UC srudents have been 
outpaci ng national averages in 
graduation rates, particularly 
among those classified as under-
represented mi nority students. 
Statistics have been compiled 
through the 2001-2002 academic 
year and were released on Nov. 12. 

Within six years of entering as 
freshmen in 1996, 77.9 percent of 
UC students had graduated by 
2002, compared with 72.1 percent 
for those entering in 1986 and 
graduating wi thin six years. The 
increase in graduation rates among 
minority srudents is over twice 
that of the University of California 
as a whole, jumpi ng from 56.1 per-
cent to 69.1 percent in the 10 
years. Graduation rates of transfer 
srudents have also increased. 

UCSD's overall graduation 
rate for 1996 entering freshmen 
was 81 percent. 

Decreasing acceptance rates 
have seemingly augmented the 
graduation rates as a whole. 

"UCSD is so se lective that 
only the academically strong are 
admitted," said Mae Brown, direc-
tor of Adm.issions and Relations 
with Schools. 

According to Brown, the aver-
age level of academic commionent 
on the part of students is raised, 
with more students pursuing 
degrees and fewer leaving school. 

UC graduation and persistence 
rates have been higher than 

national averages. According to 
data from the Chronicle of Higher 
Education, the average six-year 
graduation rate for 1996 entering 
freshmen in NCAA Division I 
universities was 59 percent. 
Conversely, at the University of 
California, 77.9 percent of those 
students graduated by the 2001-02 
academic year. 

Persistence rates have progres-
sively increased at the University 
of California overall. In 2001, 92.4 
percent of all freshmen rerurned 
for a second year of srudy, com-
pared with 88.9 percent in t 986. 
Minority student percentages are 
up nearly six percentage points 
from 84.5 percent to 89.3 percent 
for the same time period. 

UCSD's 200 I retention rate is 
94 percent, exceeded only by UC 
Berkeley at 97 percent and UCLA 
at 96 percent. 

For the second consecutive 
year, the one-year retention rate 
hit a record high for UCSD black 
srudents at 97 percent. 

According to UC spokesman 
Hanan Eisenman, the financial aid 
model that has been implemented 
at the University of California has 
had a measurable impact on per-
sistence and graduation rates. 
With two-thirds of UC students 
on some form of financial aid, it is 
becoming more manageable for 
students and their families to 
afford a college education, he said. 

Brown believes the UCSD sta-
tistics are positive. 

"These numbers show rudents 
are completing courses successful-
ly, n she said. 

A.ccording to Brown, the under-
graduate college system, combined 
with new srudent orientations, are 

helpful in getting more students to 
continue into their second year and 
ultimately obtain a degree. With 
the aid of the Finish-in-Four coun-
seling tool, as well as personalized 
srudent interaction with college 
provosts and counseling staff, the 
UCSD campus has become very 
"pro-active in advi ing and com-
mitting to srudents," Brown said. 

UC Associate Vice President for 
Srudent Academic Services Dennis 
Galligani cited the lmiversitys eligi-
bility requirements as a factor in 
UC srudents' performance. 

"Srudents who enroll at the 
University of California re well-
prepared academically and highly 
motivated," Galligani said. 

The amount of time needed to 
obtain a degree has also decreased, 
according to the study. For stu-
dents entering the university in 
1995, the average timc to obtain a 
degree decreased slightly to 4.2 
calendar years from the 19 6 aver-
age of 4.4. 

The average time to attain a 
degree for UCSD students is 
about 4.25 years. 

Individual college times range 
from an average of 12.7 quarters 
in John Muir Coll ege to an aver-
age of 13.1 quarters in both 
Revelle College and Eleanor 
Roosevelt College. 

Eisenman said he did not feel 
the time to attain a degree would 
escalate with the state budget cri-
sis. 

The University of California's 
budget has been cut by over $300 
million in non-instructional areas, 
especially in libraries, administra-
tion and outreach programs, in 
order to preserve the core educa-
tional budget.

Arguing for three hours over the placement of a comma. Most people don't spend 
that much time on their midterms, 
let alone on a meaningl ess tate-
ment that will be fC'lrgotten in two 
weeks. But that's what UCSD's all-
campus student government does. 
And that 's one of the reasons why 
much of its job could be done bet-
ter by an iMac. 

The "Associated Students of 
UCSD," as it is formally known, 
usually spends at least 50 man-
hours per week thinking about 
commas, semicolons and capital-
ization, as council members write 
"resolutions," which are essential-
ly policy statements. They repre-
sent the official position of 
ASUCSD on i sues as varied as 
San Diego's minimum wage, solar 
energy and hate crimes. These 
resolutions have no binding 
authority because ASUC D has 
no jurisdiction over labor laws or 
hate crimes, but the council insists 
that they are important, burning 
the midnight oil trying to create 
the perfect sentence. 

This tendency to spend thei r 
free time toiling over the intrica-
cies of semicolons is not, in itself, 
a cause for worry. The entire liter-
ature department is devoted to 
similar pursuits , with no signifi-

ey 
tions for student publications, 
employs a less than logical method 
of determining holY much money to 
give newspapers. The commissioner 
looks at how much money the paper 
requested, and then allocates a per-
centage of that. The newspaper edi-
tors recognize this, and often request 
more money than they need. If the 
commissioner gives them only a 
fraction of what they requested, they 
know to request more than they 
need so that they're assured enough 
money to produce the paper. 

This practice of funding based 
on the size of the request isn't 
limited to newspapers. Requesting 
$10,000 for an event always gets 
more money than requesting the 
$5 ,000 that may actually be need-
ed. If the counci l insists on dis-
tributing money in this way, an 
iMac could do the job muc h 
quicker. Student organizations 
could e-mail their requests to the 
iMac, and a serie of algorithms 
could determine the appropriate 
amount to di pense. Hook up an 
ATM to the iMac, and it's good 
to go. 

The A.S. Council recently dis-

"task forces" that have never met . 
One committee was supposed to

The A.S . council spends gobs 
of time listening to funding 
requests from student organiza-
tions. Every fraternity, cultural 
group or student-run newspaper 
(with the exception of the UCSD 
Guardian) eventually comes to 
ASUCSD asking for money. The 
senators pore over budget docu-
ments for hours and eventually 
allocate funds . The funding 
process is plagued with the prob-
lems accompanying the activities 
of any large group of people with 
control over money: human error, 
cronyism and dissimilar treatment 
of similarly situated organizations 
reque ting funds . Although sena-
tors usually try their best to 
ensure all groups are treated fair -
ly, the rules are inevitably bent to 
help out a friendly constituent 
organization . For example, during 
their Oct. 22 meeting, the A.S. 
Cou ncil su pended rul es forbid-
ding them to give tudent groups 
money for food, giving $1 ,000 to 
the Muslim Srudent sociation' 
"Ramadan Fast-A-Thon" event. 

These evil that plague the ys-
tem, all dependent upon human 
emotion , would SImply disappear If 
the funding proces were aut mated 
and monies were released based on 
an iMJIcs calculao ns. For example, 
right now A. ,ommi ioner of 
Communi ations Fran c alvon, 
the per n charged WIth re om-

meeting. At its last meeting, the 
council couldn't even decide 
whether to dissolve the non-exis-
tent task forces because theil uwn 
obscure procedural rul es forbade 
them to take action . 

Again, an iMac could replace 
ASUCSD in this regard. iMacs are 
perfectly ea pa ble of not taki ng 
action and holding imaginary 
meetings of non-existent, member-
less task forces. 

ASUCSD spends thousands of 
dollars every year sending its mem-
bers on trip to Sa ramento, San 
Francisco, Washington, D .C., and 
other cities to lobby the UC Regents 
and the federal and state govern-
ment. The council's primary focus of 
the 2002-03 lobbying season was to 
lower student fees. In fact, many of 
the candidates that r n for office last 
year claimed to have worked to fight 
the fce increa cs. Fine and dandy.

~ I LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
uc must improve 
labor relations 

Editor: 
On Oct. 3, thousands of acad-

emic student employees, or 
ASEs, throughout the UC sys-
tem - all members of United 
Auto Wo rkers Local 2865 -
engaged in a one-day unfair 
labor practice strike to protest 
the university'S continuing pat-
tern of unproductive, uncoopera-
tive and unl awful behavior in 
contract negottatlOns. UAW 
Local 2865 has filed 64 unfair 
labor practice charges against the 
university, detailing example 
after example of the university's 
efforts to stall negotiations and 
prevent the parties from reach-
ing settlement by not meeting its 
legal obligation to bargain in 
good faith . 

Sadly, the ASE's protests are 
echoed by the experience of the 
entire labor movement at the 
university. 

For decades, the University of 
California has been known as the 
most anti -union public employer 
west of the Rockies. It fought the 
unionization of ASEs for over 
15 years. 

When recognized unions do 
come to the bargaining table 
ready to negotiate contracts, the 
university bargaining team 
re ponds time and time again 
with unfair labor practices such 
as stalling, refusing to provide 
the union with information nec-
essa ry for bargaining, making 
regressive proposals and sending 
people to the bargaining tabl e 
without authority to negotiate. 

way from the bargaining table, 
the university has repeatedly 
tried to undermine tlle strength 
of the unions by trying to imple-

ment unilateral changes in 
employees' working conditions 
and otherwise attempting to 
bypass the union . 

Three years ago, however, 
then -UC President Richard 
Atkinson made a promise to the 
California Legislature and to the 
university community that from 
that day forth there would be a 
"new day" of productive and 
cooperative labor relations at the 
Universi ty of 
California. 

" 

In addition to these four 
strikes, related sympathy strikes 
and support actions undertaken 
by a total of six unions 
CUE, UC-AFT, UAW, CNA, the 
American Federation of State, 
County, and Municipal 
Employees and the University 
Professional and Technical 
Employees - have added to the 
disruption . These unions collec-
tively represent over 60,000

university, involving a total of 
four unions - the Coalition of 
University Employees, 
University Council - American 
Federation of Teachers, the 
California Nurses Association 
and the UAW - collectively 
representing 40,000 workers, or 
60 percent of the union ized 
workforce at University of 
California. T hese strikes, under-
taken to protest the university'S 
unlawful behavior, were very dis-
ruptive to the campuses and to 
tudems' education. 

2003, five unions 
(CUE, CNA, UAW, 
UPTE/CWA and UC-AFT), 
collectively representing over 
50,000 workers, or 75 percent of 
the unionized workforce at the 
university, had virtually identical 
contract language that did not 
prohibit the right to honor other 
unions' picket lines. 

In May 2003, however, the 
University of California succeed-
ed in forcing the AFT-re present-
ed lecturers to agree to contract 
language su rrendering the right 
to engage in sympathy strike . 

Then, in September 2003 , the 
University of California forced 
the AFT-represented librarians 
to similarly surrender their right 
to honor other unions' picket 
lines. o tably, the lecturers and 
librarians were the two smallest 
bargaining units with contract 
language that did not prohibit 
sympathy strikes. 

The next step in the universi -
ty's campaign to remedy its labor 
relations problems is its recent 
attempt to condition settlement 
of contracts that would change 
the UAW's contract language to 
explicitly surrender the right to 
engage in sympathy strikes. 
What the Unive rsity of 
California didn't anti ci pate, how-
ever, was that the UAW and the 
other unions at the University of 
California would stand firm in 
defense of cross-union solidarity. 

As a strategy to maintain 
labor peace, demanding that 
unions and their members sur-
render the right to protest 
unlawful treatment of other 
unions and workers does not 
work. Fundamentally, the idea 
that one can achieve peace 
through the suppression of rights 
is fool 's gold. Any respite from 
unrest gained through such tac-
tics is doomed to be temporary, 
since it does not address the root 
cause of the unrest . 

With such an approach, the 
university clearly cannot main -
tain labur peace and even con-
tributes to the likelihood of the 
recurrence of disturbance. This 
strategy is si mply bad public pol-
icy and bad labor relations. 

The University of California 
must cease going down its present 
path. It needs to trul y improve its

Concilio's conclusions are invalid Letters: 'No

Narrow,minded 'report card' suggests Latino students 
pass up UCSD because of few Latino faculty members 

Returned

Chris Taylor 

Perhaps it's the fear of being labeled racist that has cau ed a serious hesitancy to speak 
om against the UCSD 
Latino/Chicano Concilio report 
card that was issued two weeks ago. 
CenainJy, the absence of protest 
toward the paper is not because of 
its validity or truthfulness. 

In fact, tudents looking for a 
perfect example of how to take a 
legitimate and worthy cause and 
completely skew it into ineffectual, 
self-pitying rhetoric need look no 
further than the concilio's report, 
titled "A Legacy of lnstirutional 

eglect," on the "hostility" of 
UC D toward Latino students. 

While the concerns of Latino 
tudents, not to mention students 

of all racial classifications, are of the 
utmost importance in governing 
the university and providing a safe 
atmosphere, the concilio has taken 
valid concerns and turned them 
into absurdly forced claims, sup-
ported by spun facts and exaggerat-
ed rhetoric. 

The concilio issued the report 
card to the university, claiming 
thar UC D is "hostile" to not only 
the Latinos of the university but 
the entire Latino community of 
San Diego. The report stated that 
"the current condition for 
ChicanolLatinos at UCSD are 
indeed dire" and that the wealth of 
Informaoon and resource were 
"virtually inaccessible to the 
ChicanolLatino community of 
San Diego County." The report 
then a ked for Increased enroll-
ment of Laona at the university 
and Increased hmng of Latino 
staff member In order to accom-
modate the expected number of 
Latino and Chicano students. 

The report critici7.ed the uni-
versity for its failure to act decislve-

lyon Latino diversity. While it is 
doubtlessly true that most of the 
univer ity's rhetoric was symbolic, 
the concilio's report misconstrues 
or ignores many facets that must be 
addressed before taking more dras-
tic measures. In addition, the 
report exemplifies the narrow-
minded viewpoint of special inter-
est groups that aren't really working 
toward diversity, but rather toward 
achieving their own agendas. 

For example, one reason listed 
for inhospitality at UCSD was a 
stagnation of Latino/Chicano 
admissions rather than an increase, 
As of this year, the enrollment of 
Latinos is hovering between 8 and 
10 percent. The argument the 
report uses is that this falls absurd-
ly short of the 30 percent of the 
San Diego community that Latino 
constitute. 

Thi would be a well-placed fact 
except that Caucasian students onJy 
make up 37 percent of the UCSD 
population when they cover nearly 
66.5 percent of San Diego County. 
Even if you widen the area to 
California, whites are still under-
represented by up to 10 percent. If 
we are going to enroll by such suin-
gent racial quotas, then more white 
students had best be enroUed as 
well. Perhaps we can picle and 
choose which races should suffer in 
order to increase white student rep-
resentation. That would go over 
well with the concilio, I'm sure. 

In other words, to meet the con-
cilio~ requirements, other minority 
groups will have to suffer. Or we can 
continue to discriminate against 
white students, who are also "under-
represented" in the university. While 
the concilio merely wants to raise 
Latino student enrollment, which is 
theoreticaIly noble, to try to specifi-
cally raise one race's enrollment num-
bers IS borderline-racist by the basic 
definition of the word. 

The report also demand that 
UC D hire more faculty and staff 
In order to accommodate the 
need of Laono students. If the 
people that wrote this report are 
so concerned With the dilapidation 
of their ethnic studies and culture-

specific departments, they had 
better bite the bullet and stand in 
line. UCSD is so preoccupied 
with its scientific research that 
many of the non-science depart-
ments are left out to dry. This is 
not institutionalized neglect but 
rather a pursuit of science and a 
deliberate unconcern with most 
other areas of study. 

The report further suggests 
that it is UCSD's fault when stu-
dents that are accepted choose 
not to attend. First, the report 
mentions that one in four Latinos 
declines acceptance. Oddly 
enough, that is the same ratio as 
students of all colors that decline 
acceptance. This argument is 
baseless because it is true across 
all skin colors. 

Second, the concilio reasons 
that this 75-percent rejection is 
based on the idea that Latino 
students do not feel welcome at 
UCSD. This is an intriguing 
facet that is often overlooked. 
Why should Latino/Chicano stu-
dents feel unwelcome? Is it 
because they have no resources 
or staff to encourage 
their ethnicity? 

Perhaps, but no one considers 
white students of rich cultural 
heritages such as Irish, French, 
Scandinavian or German. These 
students have no club, resource 
center, ethnic appreciation or 
special favors . 

The repon even has the audac-
ity to suggest that some Latino 
student don't attend UCSD 
because of the rumor of a racist 
newspaper - that is, Tbe Koo/o. 
This SOrt of absurd hypersensitiv-
ity should be given no credibility. 
If Latinos/Chicanos refuse to 
mend UCSD because of a per-
ceived notion that the Koala i 
racist, then no ethnicity should 
mend UCSD, where the Koala 
runs free to insult all races. 

Furthermore, along that line 
of thinking, white students 
should not attend this school 
becau e the ew Indicator ha 
repeatedly said that all whites are 
racist, and Voz FronttrlUl repeat-

The most laughable state-
ment, however, did not come 
from the report itself, bur rather 
from the university. While avoid-
ing any comments on the report 
and its fi ndings, the university 
representative said that the uni -
versity "appreciates [the con-
cilio's] commitment to diverSity." 

Diversity? The concilio is cen-
tered on only one race's goals: 
their own, How is this diversity? 
Can anyone imagine an Asian stu-
dent writing a report like this, 
claiming that, for diversity'S sake, 
all demands regarding only Asian 
students must be met? The mere 
idea elicits hearty chuckles. 
"Laughable" should be the term 
used for the concilio's report. 

No doubt the rebuttal is a 
watered-down message about how 
the concilio relates to every 
underrepresented minority on 
campus. However, that means 
nothing considering certain 
groups are often neglected from 
such rhetoric, such as the campus' 
Jewish studen ts. 

There should be no question 
that the university should be 
working toward a campus where 
all students feel safe. However, 
this repon card should not sway 
the university at all. It is no differ-
ent from every other advocacy 
group's "damning repons," 
wrought from every belief system, 
cultural group and political ideol-
ogy that wants things bener for 
them specifically. 

o doubt 1 will be called a 
racist as well. But when mi9Con-
strued fact and gros exaggera-
tion arc protected under the

speak out, regardle of the con-
sequences. And I assure you, I

ted in the name of equality,

checking eBay to sec if the tate 
of Iabama was selling that rock 
with the 10 Commandments on it 
(what a great idea to chip away at 

a state deficit!), 1 headed out to 
Interstate 8 to visit Mission 
Fashion Valley Center Hazard 
Plaza . (It's all the same to me.) 

I stumbled into Border's Books 
& Music and bellied up to the 
front display where the newer and 
more popular titles could proba-
bly be found. 

Nothing rcally piqued my 
interest, but I did notice a paper-
back by Dr. Laura Schlessinger, a 
character my friend told me earli-
er was the evil stepsister of 
Beczlcbub. Apparently, my friend 
had been trapped on a family trip 
somewhere with his mother and 
was exposed to a heal thy dosage of 
the good doctor. 

I was curious about the hype. 
Her book was titled, " 10 Stupid 
Things Couples Do To Mess Up 
Their Relationships." Interesting. 
J turned the cover over to see if 
staples such as "drinking more 
than an Irish family reunion" or 
"cheating with the family babysit-
ter" made her list. Alas, I wa in 
for a real urprise. 

The doctor was very technical 
in her diagnosis for a failed rela-
tionship. When she said "stupid 
things," she meant it. 

All 10 chapters were "stupid" 
in the literal sense. She wanted to 
make sure that her readers knew 
that ob tacles like "stupid ego-
tism," "stupid excuses" and "stu-
pid pettiness" (to name a few) 
would eventually lead to a "stupid 
breakup," which, by the way, is 
al 0 stupid.

One of the middle chapters was 
known as "stupid happiness." 
Yeah, screw happiness: Just bring 
on the expensive jewelry, crying 
toddlers and the obligatory bed-
and-breakfast weekends. 
Happiness mu t be overrated in a 
relationship; just ask Frank and 
Estelle Costanza in "Seinfeld." 

I tossed back the book in dis-
guSt. Stupid happiness? Come on, 
who would read such piffle? 

My question was immediately 
answered when, out of the corner 
of my eye, I spied a " I'W Yo"k

My confidence in the 
American consumer had once 
again reached an all-time low, 
thinking that this book had sold 
more copies than any other 
book, when I saw that the book 
next to it - "Self Matters," by 
that tool Dr. Phil - was a" tW 
York TimtS Best Seller" as well. 
Hmm. 

I roa med th rough the en ti rc 
display to see that almost half of 
the books were dubbed best se ll -
ers. What the hell? Ilow could 
there be this many best se llers? 
There's only supposed to be one 
best, that's why it's the best . 
"Best" isn't plural, "best" is the 
number one, the cream of the 
crop, the highest pinnacle one 
could reach, the supreme. The 
only things "supreme" about Dr. 
Phil are the chalupa he must 
stuff in tho e chipmunk cheeks 
of his . 

I was jaded about the whole 
thing as soon as I saw that even 
"The Wisdom of l"lenopause" was 
a best eller. In retrospect, I guess 
if you can write a whole book con-
vincing people that fits of inco-
herent rage and hair-trigger tears 
are signs of wisdom, you deserve 
to be a best seller. But as I roamed 
the store, it became painfully clear 
that tht ew York Timu was giving 
out these honors like Ns in a p y-
chology course. Hell, all 16,045 of 
the "Chicken Soup for the oul" 
titles were bestsellers.

Confused, I decided it was time to

the store without making

e nough, they didn't have any

I asked Kathy Park of the

were just being modest (pride is a

the Bible had too many versions

just one book.

can't blame her for not owning up 
to that one.

Clery: Campus records 
sharp rise in vehicle theft 

continued from page I 
905 in 2001 and 1,037 in 2002 . 

"This is not necessarily because 
[substance abuse] is more wide-
spread," Cresap said. "I believe the 
overall attitude of the university 
and college systems has changed. 
They have become a lot more con-
scious, more vigilant. There are 
[simply] more arrests." 

According to the statistics, 
arrests for narcotics outnumber 
those for alcohol offenses, while 
disciplinary referrals for alcohol 
vastly outnumber those for drugs. 

Rising even more sharply, the 
number of motor vehicle thefts 
more than doubled from 61 inci-
dents in 2001 to 143 in 2002. 

Thurgood Marshall College 
senior Chris Banuelos learned 
about auto theft first-hand . 

"My car was stolen from campus 
last spring," Banuelos said. "It was 
[later] found in Chula Vista. But it 
was horrible .. . I didn't have a car 
all summer because of it." 

According to Cresap, the cam-
pus is a target for car theft. 

"We have spurts in auto theft," 
Cresap said. "It tends to run in 
cycles ... and in this county such 
theft is often organized. Becau e 
of the location, vehicles stolcn 
from campus usually end up in 
Mexico. Large parking lots such as 
ours are easy places to hop, as 
they are hard for us to cover in 
their entirety." 

Reported incidents of aggra-
vated assault dropped from 13 
incidents in 200 I to four incidents 
in 2002. Other more serious 
crimes such as sex offenses, mur-
ders , hate crime and arson have 

remained at virtually zero occur-
rences. 

"We've had one or two mur-
ders," Cresap said. "But that's over 
years and years." 

In addi tion, the report con-
tains information describing cam-
pus policies and practices that 
pertain to crime reporting, com-
munity safety alerts, alcohol and 
drugs, student discipline, victims 
assistance programs, campus 
resources and crime prevention, 
as well as personal safety tips. 
The Clery Report encourages the 
reporting of all crime occurrences 
and explains how to report crimes, 
including sexual assault crimes. 

"No place is safe 100 percent," 
Cresap said. "In general, the num-
bers of occurrences [in relation to] 
the size of campus are low ... 
[UCSD] is one of the safest com-
munities in the county." 
A full version of the Clery Report 
can be downloaded in PDF format 
at hl1p:llpoliet.lIcsd.fdll, or can be 
obtained from the police sration 
located behind Price Center. 

The crime stati tics are orga-
Ilized into chart, which pan the 
three years prior to the report's 
publication . 

The statistics are also divided 
into four reporting locations: on 
campus; on-campus residential life 
building ; non- ampus property, 
including the La Jolla Del 01 
Apartments and all UC 0 
Extension locations; and public 
property, which involves the areas 
inmlcdiately surrounding campus, 
including Genesee Avenue, LaJ alia 
Village Drive and La Jolla Shores 
Drive. 

Aid: Federal assistance small 
percentage of UCSD aid 

conlinued from page I 
article, found that federal distribu-
tion of financial aid disproportion-
ately favors wealthy private instiru-
tions. 

Unlike individual benefits, such 
as Cal Grants and scholarship, 
which students can use at any uni-
ver ity, the goverrunenr allocates 
money for work-study and Perkin 
loans directly to colleges, which 
choo e which students receive 
funding. 

uThere is an old formula - it's 
been around for a long time - that 
allocates funds to universities based 
on their 'conditional guarantees' 
and their 'fair share,'" said Vince 
De Anda, UCSD's financial aid 
director. U\t's been there for a long 
time." 

When the government firsl 
began to give campu -based fund -
ing more than 30 year ago, the 
amounlS were decided not by for-
mulas, but by how well a university 
could make ilS case to groups of 
educational experts. The school 
that did abner job in lobbying 
received a bigger portion of the aid, 
and current 'conditional guaran-
tees' remain largely based on these 
original appropriation, according 
to the New York 7imtJ. 

Under laws pa d since 1980, 
legi lalor approved a different 
approach, using a "fair share" for-
mula . IIowever, to ensure that col-
leges did nOl re eive less than they 
had been getting before, the new 
arrangement affe ted only new 
money added to the programs. 

Funding ha remained tagnal1l 
for the last 15 years, meaning lhat 
there has been virtually nothing to 
di lribute u ing the ufair share" 
YSt m, De Anda said . 

Univer itie have the same di tTI -
burion, which does tlot take inlo 
account the need f current MU -
d n or surge in student popul 
lion. 

'''me other thrng thal happens, 
, think, i lhat school that grow 

tend to lose out on a per-ca pita 
basis," Dc Anda said. 

Both UCSD and USD get 
approximately $2 .3 million for 
lheir campus-ba cd programs, but 
almost ,000 more UCSD stu-
dent applied for financial aid in 
2001. The UC D population has 
grown by 32 percent since 1990, 
compared to U 0' 17 percent 
increase during the same time 
while its federal funding has 
remained nearly equal, according 
to the California Postsecondary 
Education Commission. 

These programs, however, rep-
resent only a portion of financial 
aid awarded to SUI dents. 

"Campus-based programs have 
become a very mall part of the 
total financial aid package. When 
they started off, they were a major 
portion, but of late, the federal ... 
funding ha pretty much dimin-
ished," Dc Anda said. "These fig-
ures have been fairly stagnant, and 
as 3 portion of the financial aid pic, 
they' re very small. " 

The $2 .3 million represenlS 1.6 
percent of dle $141 .8 million in aid 
awarded lO UCSD Uldents in the 
2002-03 s hool year. For the entire 
state, les than 4 percent of the 
financial help came in the form of 
campus-based aid, according to the 
California Student Aid 
Comlni sion. 

Federal Pell grants and subsi-
dized loan , whi h go dirccdy to 
snrdents no matter what college 
they attend, and other upport pro-
vided by IIldivldual institutions

JEREMY PAUL 
GALLAGHER 

A.S. President shares his thoughts, goals and routine 
The demands are brutal : a $1.5 million budget to 

oversee, a staff of fellow students to manage, over a hun-
dred on-campus organizations to serve. But as .s. 
Pre ident, Jeremy Paul Gallagher couldn't be happier. 

A Thurgood Marshall College senior who's more like-
ly to ask, " ' ley, how's it going?" than to talk about himself, 
Gallagher was elected last year to serve as the chief exec-
utive officer of an organi7..ation serving over 20,000 stu-
denlS. The responsibilities of the president of the 
Associated Srudents are virtually never-ending. 
It 's not uncommon for Gallagher to 

array of responsibilities do. 
"J eremy gives 110 percent," A .. Commissioner of 

Academic Affairs Todd Tolin said. "I swear that guy lives 
up here." 

Gallagher represents the student body in a variety of 
capacities , including attending campus policy and 
Chamber of Commerce meetings. 

"Some days, I'm just like, 'Wow, thi s is overwhelm-

) 

ing," Gallagher said. "But I serve as the representative 
for the srudent body in whatever capacity that is needed." 

The job may overwhelm him at times, but Gallagher 
remains dedicated . 

"A past A.S. president told me, 'You have no idea 
what you're getting yourself into,'" he said. U[ thought I 
knew what was going on, because [ had previous experi-
ence as a commissioner, but it wa really a dramatic level 
of involvement change. I mean, I ne\'er thought I'd be 
waking up before sun-up and working before school 

even started. But I really, really enjo), it." 
A communication and political science double 

major, Gallagher is described as 'a people person' 
by co-workers and friends . 

"Jeremy gets his sruff done, but hes fun to 
work with," Tolin said. "I just feel that 

he is a really good leader - he does it 
with humor. Jeremy's humor is real-
ly unique and random. You 'd have 
to experience it. I think anyone who 
works with him gets used to him." 

For example, in the cluttered, 
always-bustling A.S . office, 
Gallagher can often be heard 
yelling random phrases. 

"'r am a lamp!' is probably the 
phrase of the year," Tolin said. "Last 

year, it was 'Wonderfun!' Whenever 
I'm up here with him, he always treats 

everyone the same - he jokes with 
everyone. Even though there s supposed-
ly some SOrt of A.S. hierarchy, you never 
feel like you're in one up here." 

Currently. GaJlagher is also involved 
with the College Democrats, a student 
organization committed to promoting 
Democratic ideals. 

In the past, Gallagher also ran the 
Thurgood Marshall College TV station, anti 
last year he served as a resident advisor at 
Sixth College. 

Tolin worked along ide Gallagher as a 
fellow RA. 

"He really made that work envi ron-
ment fun," Tolin said. UHe had all these 
really amazing relationship with his re -
Idents - even now they get really excit-
ed when he vi its ." 

Tolin is also an RA this year for many 
of Gallaghers former residents. 

"It gets really difficult to compete ,\;!.h 
Jeremy Paul Gallagher," he said. "I Ie real -
ly exudes this air of being laid-back, Jnd 

people feel COI~ rt:lble around him. But in 
reality, he's n t all that laid-back. But even 

when he gets tressed, he puts everyone d e 
in this comfort rone." 

Gallagher contends hi~ RA experience was 
one of hi mo t ucce sful accomplishments at 

UC D. 
"[Being an RAJ played a huge role in my life," 

Gallagher aid. "That wa reall y, really full. It was 
probably one of the greatc t experience of-my life. 
There were only j,x RAs on taff, and the level of 
inten Ity of tarting a brand-new college and red II)' 
working through that whole process with ju t ix 
t>eople is really amazing." . . 

Such experience, coupled WIth personal Ideals, 
have inspired Gallagher's vi ion for changes needed 
on campus. 

"I think the campus in general i m rc liberal 
than not, and so I think I'm representative of that," 
Gallagher aid. "I ran with a liberal ~oup [~n last 
year 's election], and so we ran on more hberalldeal . 
But I'm the type of person who likes to stick issue-
specific, and for each i ue I make up my deci ion." 

For Gallagher, a key i ue is providing a ecure 
environment for all rudents on campu . In an 

attempt to reach one of the peci6c communi-
ties o n campu , Gallagher is pushing for 

lesbian, ~y, bi exual and transgen-
der-themed hou ing. He hope

I COLLEGE SURVIVAL GUIDE 
Buses, trolleys move UCSD 

By NATALIE JEW 
Contributing Writer 

So, you've finally made it on 
your own. You tudied hard for 12 
straight years, and have just landed 
yourself a ticket to freedom. The 
world is your oyster - you can go 
anywhere you want, do anything 
you choose and the best part is, 
you don't have to answer to any-
one. 

But, you may have one problem: 
How are you going to get there? 
The bait is out there, and you're 
ready to bite, but you don't seem to 
have any fins to carry you along the 
way. What good is living in the 
acclaimed city of San Diego if you 
don't have any way to explore it? 
\Vell, now you do. This is your 
excuse-free guide to getting around 
and maximizing your newfound 
freedom . 

Shuttle your elf out of here: 
Fir t and foremo t, become 
acquainted with the UCSD shut-
tle system. If you haven't already 
taken advantage of it, then you 
may have at least seen the campus 
shuttle stops on your way to class. 
We have the c10clcwi e and 
counter-clockwise loops, which 
will take you to various stops 
around campus. 

But enough with cla s, let's 
move on to the fun part. The 
Ciryshuttle, whose pick-up/drop-
off area is located near Mandeville 
Auditorium, can take you to a 
friend's aparrment al La Jolla 
Colony, or to University Town 
eCenter, the clo est mall to cam-
pus. The shuttle StopS at Regents 
Road, obel Drive, Lebon Road 
and most of the surrounding 
streets. There are also shuttle 
stops that will take you to various

From here, you will find your 

passport to downtown, Fash ion

"The way I thought is that this

like an 'invisible' culture." 
'Although Geoffrey Williams, an 

Earl Warren College freshman who 
also added his name to the "out" list, 
feels that the existing housing policy 
is neither hetero- nor homosexist, 

he also believes the 
addition of such 
housing would be

this is just one tlung 
to fix .... in an 
attempt to improve

THE UCSD GUARDIAN FEATURES 13 

Transportation: Safe ride service is free 
continued from page I ~ 

Now, if this is all juSt a little 
too local for you, you may want to 
take bus No. 30 downtown where 
you can either check out Horton 
Plaza mall or walk around the 
Gaslamp District, which has 
numerous stores and restaurants. 
Scope out the perfect one for you. 
The busses that transport from 
UCSD provide countless possibil-
ities, but be careful. Most buses 
stop running at midnight, but 
there are tho e that stop running 
as early as 9:30 p.m. 

To be sure, check the timeta-
bles, wtllch can be found at the 
Transportation and Parking 
Services office located at the 
Gilman Parking Structure. 

Trolley: For a little taste of 
San Francisco, you can try out 
the San Diego Trolley system. 
One-way fares range from $1 to 
$3 and will take you all around 
San Diego. You can transfer to 
the trolley from the Fashion 

Valley bus te rminal. The Trolley 
offers a special student month-
long pass at a cost of $67. That 
may seem like a hefty cost, but 
the trolley goes all around San 
Diego, from EI Cajon to San 
Ysidro. Along the way, you can 
stop at Mission Valley, Imperial 
Beach, Qualcomm Stadium or 
Old Town. 

The Trolley runs from 4 a.m. 
to midnight on Monday, 4 a.m. to 
2 a.m. on Saturday and 4 a.m. to 
12:30 a.m. on Sunday. 

Triton Taxi: So now that you 
know about all of the places you 
can go, you're ready to have fun. 
But what if something happens? 
What if your ride abandons you or 
you're too inebriated and it's too 
late to take use of the aforemen-
tioned forms of transportation? 
No need to get scared, that's 
where the good people at 
Associated Students and Cloud 9 
Shuttles come in. The Triton Taxi, 
a program started by the A.S. 

Council in 2001-02, can be used 
to get you out of ttlls messy situa-
tion. Just call the number located 
on your Triton Taxi sticker (avail-
able on the second floor of Price 
Center), and Cloud 9 Shuttles will 
pick you up. However, it is impor-
tant to remember that you can 
only use the service once per night 
and that the Triton Taxi only runs 
from II p.m. to 3 a.m. on Friday 
and Saturday nights. Call before 
2:30 to guarantee a safe ride 
home. 

There it is. Now you can enjoy 
your freedom to go anywhere and 
see anything. Just don't be late for 
class. Also, keep in mind the 
schedules for each form of trans-
portation listed. Just like you, the 
busses and trolleys and taxis have 
to sleep sometime. For more 
information and alternative 
modes, check out 
http://www.sdcommuu.com. Now 
go out and have yourself some 
fun.

Men's water polo concludes regular season with loss 
UCSD gives up late goals to host UC Irvine in a narrow 8 .. 7 defeat 
By MATTHEW GRANT 

Staff Writer 

The No. 6 UCSD men s water 
polo team posted its first los in six 
games Nov. 14 in the final match of 
the regular season against No. 7 
UC Irvine at the Irvine Anteater 
Aquatic Complex, in a tight 8-7 
score. The Tritons were seeking 
their third win and a sweep of the 
Anteaters this season, but lost. 

The first quarter opened with a 
pair of man-up scoring opportuni-
tie that the Anteaters were able to 
capitalize on. 

Junior driver ate Cooper 
retaliated in the final I minute 
and 5 seconds of the period to 
bring UCSD within striking dis-
tance for a 1-2 deficit . 

"We weren 't intimidated by 
them at any point," Cooper said. 
"We had a good overall offense, 
but we couldn 't convert We were 
making good things happen with-
out following through." 

This year, the Tritons have 
struggled in games which they 
have lost the first quarter, going 
three for lOin such match ups. 

"We started out slow," senior 
co-ca ptain and utility Matthew 
Ustaszewski said. "We didn 't have a 
lot of energy, but we were able to 
pick it up and we played well in the 
econd half." 

The Anteaters' success early in 
the match would not go unreward-
cd. 

While ucr was able to score its 
fir t goal within 22 seconds of the 
quarter-opening sprint, the Tritons 
managed to regain compo ure as 
team-high corer and junior dri -
vers Jonathan H o pkins and 

Rebecu Drexler ICuordion file 
Up in smoke: Triton Kevin Smoker and his teammates gave up the game-winning goal with fIVe seconds left in the game.

"We weren 't aggressive," 
Ustaszewski said. "It 's like we were

Soccer: Men' team is 
winle again t Chico State 

coruinued {rom page 20 
to come off of the bench after 
being unable to play the previous 
five games due to injury. To fill 
holes in the defensive line left- by 
the two key pla)'ers, the Tritons 
started freshman Matt 
FinkJestein as the left defender 
with senior Ryan Mizumoto and 
sophomore Kevin Murray -
both accustomed ro playing mid-
field - as the other two defend-
er. 

The Wildcats broke the score-
less tie at the 83 minute and 27 
second mark when they got 
through Triton defense and Jason 
Phillip took a cros to beat goal-
keeper Jeremy Cookson . First 
:ream All-CCAA forward Chri 
Wondolow ki and Bren W!lIiams 
assisted on the play. 

"We made a linle error in the 
back. We were a little bit tired, 
and they ju t got through," 
Arm trong aid. 

The 'Wildcats then put the 
game away at 7:29 on a break-
away goal while the Tritons were 
pushing up, desperately trying ro 
get the equalizer and extend their 
sea on by at least 10 more mjn-
utes. V\'illiams and Michael Esser 
assisted on the goal scored by 
Brian Phillips, who blasted a shot 
from the rop of the penalty box. 

The 2-0 loss was the Tritons' 
third setback from Chico tate 
thlS season. The Wildcats beat 
UCSD, 3-1, al Triton Soccer 

tadium on OCt. 3, and posted a 
dominating 5-1 victory over the 
Tritons in the CCAA 
Championship on ov. 9. 

"Obviously we were all disap-
pointed with the loss (on ov. 
14], but we played ',000 percent 
bener than we did last [week-
end]," Armstrong said.

something from the performance, 
and we were absolutely magnifi-
cent." 

With the win, Chico tate 
earned the right to play o. 1 
seed Cal State Dominguez }-lill , 
ranked fifth nationally, in the 
regional final on Nov. 16. The 
winner of that game advanced for 
a chance to play for the national 
champion hip. Results of the 

ov. 16 final were unavailable at 
pre s time. 

"Anyone of the three teams 
[in the Far \Vest Region] could 
have gone through to ,vin the 
national title," Armstrong said. 
"Three teams in the region were 
that strong. The winner will 
probably go on to win the cham-
pionship." 

With the 10 s in the Far West 
Regional Semifinal, the Trirons 
ended their season 11-7-1. In 
2003 UCSD earned its first-ever 
trip to the CCAA Final and 
NCAA tournament since moving 
ro Division II . 

"It's been a good season, and I 
am very pleased "~th our perfor-
mance," Armstrong aid. 

Fencing: UCSD ho ts it 
only tournament of the year 

conunued from /}aRe 2 0 
"Our men's sabre team i~ the 

srrength of our team and a 
national-class abre squad," 
UCSD head coach Stuart Lee 
aid. "Those three all have the 

potential to make ational ." 
Led by the sabre team, the 

men's quad defealed Cal Tech, 
AIr Force Academy, Cal tate 
Fullerton and U.S. MIlitary 
Academy, but lost ro tanford. 
The women's squad defeated Cal 
lech, Cal tate Fullerton and 
U.S. MIlitary Academy, but lost 
to Air Force Academy and 
Stanford. Both teams were led by 
strong efforts from freshman 
fOlllsts; Jesse Taylor on the men's 
side, going 14-1 for the day, and 
Lauren Walker for the women, 
who fimshed 12 - 3. It was the first 

AA event for each of the 
young rencers, both of whom 
fenced III high school. 

"I felt that my toughest com-
petitors came from Cal State 
Fullerton," Walker said . "All 
three members of theIr team 
were consistently StTOng, and I 
had SOme tough bouts WIth them. 
With Ihe variety or compeUlIon 

at the collegiate level, you can 
never be overconfident." 

To the untramed eye, the event 
was nothing like a scene out of 
"The Mask of Zorro," or any 
other "fencing" film. lne action 
was slow and tentative at times, 
fast and intense at others, and 
occa IOnaUy even seemingly out of 
control, a combatants would 
charge one another. However, 
according ro Taylor and Walker, 
the sport is an acqUired taSte. 

"Fencing I n't your average 
spectatOr sport. It's on of lake 
football - if you don't under-
stand it, you're lost ... [but} once 
you gel it explained to you, you 
stili might not understand it all, 
but it becomes a lot more Imer-
e ting." 

The meet was UCSD's last 
event of the calendar year. Thear 
next competition IS Feb. 4 at anta 
Barbara, Calif., against UC Irvine, 
UC Santa Barbara, UCLA and 

SC, all squads the team defeated 
earlier t1us season . Until then, 
'Iaylor, Walker and the rest of the 
team Intend to conunue traJrung. 

"My personal goal i to make 
nauonals in March," Taylor said.

fell to fellow A11-CCAA Second 
Team senior midfielder Kristen 
Conahan, but at point blank range, 
Conahan didn't have enough of an 
angle to beat the goalie, and she 
knocked the ball right off the goalie's 
hand and away. 

"We had a few mistimed runs, 
but nothing you wouldn't ee at the 
pro level," McManu said. UCSD 
came into the game with a total of 
61 goals while only allowing 17. 

enior forward Kri tin Jones, 
the CCAA Most Valuable Player of 
the Year, had another strong game 
and finished with three shots, two 
on net. But even her fru tration at 
the inability to put one away 
showed when she threw her hands 
up in the air and slowly walked 
back up the field after her cross was 
ent right at the Cal State San 

Bernardino goalie. 
Also playing a strong game were 

sophomore sweeper Heather 
Szafraniec ami freshman mid fielder 
Megan Dickey, who came on as a 
ubstitute in the second half. 

Szafraniec kept her composure in 
the back and helped weather the few 
scoring chances Cal tate San 
Bernardino had in a nervous 0-0 tie 
game, where one misplay leading to 
an opponent goal could have sent 
the Tritons home for the winter. 

Dickey played a strong midfield 
and bent a couple of free kicks 
around defensive walls, only to ee 
them both just clear the crossbar. 

The game drew nearly 1,000 
fans, adding to the playoff atmos-
phere. 

U D Mil now play host to Cal 
State Dominguez Hills on Nov. 17, 
facing the Toros for the second 
time in three games after UCSD 
bested them in the CCAA finals . 
The game against Cal State 
Dominguez I IiI Is will finish the 

CAA first round, with three more 
rounds remaining. 

Earlier in the day, Cal State 
Dominguez Hills defeated Seattle 
Pacific, 2-1, in semifinal action at 
Triton Soccer Stadium. Their vic-
tory earned them a berth into the 
Far West Regional finals against 
UCSD. Game time for ti,e ov. 17 
match is 7 p.m. at Triton Soccer 
Stadium.

Year." 

Jone , often called "Jonesy" by 
McManus and her teammate, 
received honors for her consistent 
contributions to the team. he led 
UCSD With 11 as i ts, 27 points 
and tied with Cochran for most 
goals with eight. She also 
impressed the voters by leading the 
CCAA in overall assists, points per 
game and assists per game. When 
asked about her awards, Jones was 
modest and quicldy pointed out 
that the whole team de erved 
recognition. 

"[These awards] are an honor 
because there arc a lot of good 
players out there, but our whole 
team really de erves the e honors," 
Jones said. "They never get enough 
recognaoon . For example, Molly 
and Chri tine finally got hon red 
after four years of working so 
hard." 

Jone has been ential \0 the 
succes of the Tritons during her 
rour-year tenure, as eVlden ed by 
this year~ awards and her 2 2 
honors as econd Team All-
American and A11- AA Fir t 
Team and her 2001 All-CCAA 

econd lcam el tion. McManu 
was happy she received MVP and a 
Fir t -leam election. 

"Jone y de erved them. 
oache always pick her (for hon-

or ) because he's consi tent. he's 
a winner," M anus aid. 

Jones' fellow All-CCAA First 
Te3m honoree and Freshman of 
the Year Cochran scored eight 
goals, was second in game-winning 
goals wi th three and total poi nts 
with 22. Cochran is the second-
consecutive Triton to earn the 
Freshman of the Year distinction 
after sophomore defender I leather 
Szafraniec won the award in 2002 . 
McManu ha been impres ed with 
Cochran' efforts throughout the 
sea on and into the post-season. 

" [Cochran] is a good 
freshman. She's got goals, 
game--winning goals and 

assists. he's rhe real 
d.enl."

"[Co hran] deserved [her 
awards} . he's a good freshman," 
McManu s~id . "She's gO( goals, 
game-winning goal and a ists. 
She' the real deal." 

Cochran, however, was also 
mod l about taJcing credit for her 
conmbutions. he was flattered to 
be honor d, but admjtl d he is not 
"big on awards or attcntion, but it 
i nice to be recognized for hard 
work." 

Mendoza , with fOllr goals and 
five a ists, was named A11 -CCAA 
Second Team, making it the third 
year in a row she has been recog-
ni7,cd. She was a 2001 Fir t Team 
All-American and also an A11-
CCAA First Team honoree in 2001 
and 2002. As a defender, she has 
been key to successfully keeping 
opponents from scoring and has 
provided leader hip for the past 
three years as co-captain. 

Coache selected Conahan to 
the All -CCAA Second Team for 
finishing in the top three of UCSD 
in goals, points and a team-high 
four game-winning goals. onahan 
is currently tied for fir t in goals 
with Cochran and Jones. A clutch 
player, Conahan was distinguished 
in 2002 as a Second Team AlI-
American and an AlI -C AA First 
Team selection. 

Receiving honor for tllC first

U SD dosed out the Sea wolves, 
30-26. 

UCSD matched a season high

game match. Opposite sophomore 
Lindsay Crande ll had nine total 
blocks with junior middle I lockers 
Kendra Canape and Katie Hogan 
adding seven and six, respectively. 

had 17 to lead the team, followed 
by Wilson's 12 and junior setter 
Teresa Ohta's 11. Wilson also had 
the match-high in kills with IS, 
while fellow junior outside hitter 
Stacy Dunsmore had 12 . California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
assists leader Ohta padded her lead 
with 45 as ists for the match. 

or the Crandell, Dunsmore and 
Wil on trio, each tallied 11 kills to 
share match-high honors. As a 
team, San Francisco State managed 
only 24 kills with a .057 attacking 
percentage. 

Wilson was glad that UCSD was 
able to keep its high level of play and 
not sink to the level of the GatOTS. 

The Triton werc happy with the 
accomplishment, but insisted that 
the high number of blocks was sim-
ply a result of taking care of business. 

On ov. IS, UC D 1T3veled to 
San Francisco State to take on the 

ators in their final conrerence 
match of the season. A Triton win 
combined with a loss from confer-
ence-leading Cal State San 
Bernardino would have resulted in a 
share of the CCAA title, and UC D 
took care of its end of the bargain in 
quick fashion. It took the Tritons just 
70 minutes to sweep the Cators, 3-0 
(30-12, 30-18 and 30-13). 

"We managed to stay on top and 
play our game despite them not 
playing that well," she said. 

"We've been working on it and 
we just did what we needed to do," 
junior outside hitter Bonnie Wilson 
aid. 

UCSD's 61 dig augmented the 
strong defensive effort by the 
"Tritons. Senior libcro Lauren Mills 

The win places the Tritons at 25-
4 overall, and 19-3 in CCAA, placing 
UCSD second in the conference to 
Cal State San Bernardino for the

son, and as a result, the Seasiders 
could possibly lose their berth into

In Its fir {-ever appearance in 
the NCAA Division II postseason 
tournament, the UCSD men's soc-
cer team was SIX and a half minutes 
away from forcing overtime with 
No. 10 Chico State, but two late 
goals by the Wildcats eliminated 
the Tritons, 2-0, in their Far West 
Regional Semifinal match on Nov. 
14 in Car on, Calif. 

"\Vith six minutes to go, we 
were ready to go to overtime. 
We're undefeated in overtime this 
year, but then we made an error in 
the backfield," UCSD head coach 
Derek Armstrong said. "Bu{ we 
played an ab olutely magnificent 
game." 

The Tritons, the third seed in 
the Far West Region, were the 
aggres or in the first half. UCSD 
outshot Chico tate, 5-2, pressured 
Wildcat goalie Dominik Jakubek, 
and took six corner kicles in the fi rst 
45 minutes. 

"We killed them in the first 
half," Armstrong said. "Their goal-
keeper really kept them in it." 

ChiCO State began to gain 
momentum in the second half and 
tired Out the young UCSD lineup. 
Senior defender Jonathan Shum 
was unavailable, serving a one-

After clinching the California 

Collegiate Athletic Associatioo

UCSD women's soccer team 
took its lint step toward an 
NCAA championship on Nov. 
15. In a game that saw multiple 
chances slip through the cncb 
for the Tritons, it took a fresh-
man substitute to serve the 
game-winning ball in a 1-0 coo-
test against Cal State San 
Bernardino. 

Freshman midlielder Alise 
MaUey came onto the field with 
10 minutes left to play in the 
game and paid immediate divi-
dends. Her fresh legs took advan-
tage of a fatigued Cal State San 
Bernardino defense. MaUey 
worked the ball to the ript side 
of the penalty box and lofted a 
service into the mix on the lone 
score of the game.
