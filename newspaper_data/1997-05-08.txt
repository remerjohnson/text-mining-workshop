On Tue~day, SO\ A cademi c enate voted resound -

school at U SO.

Whlk ",e arc all lor democracy. it\ a :-.harne that a

entirel y. I::veryonc Ihinl-.. ~ the chaner . c hool I~ a good 
Idea - at ka~t in theory - but they di~agn;e on how to 
make the theory a reailt } . 

The cademi c Sellate ·:-. many committees, which :-.pent 
a g reat <.leal of tll11e reViewing th e propo:-.al long before 
Tuesday\ hi ~lOric vote. found a ho~t of problem, wi th 
the propo~al. Marshall a llege Provost ecil Lytle -
th e driving force behind the project - and o th er mem-

ber~ of the charter school \ steering committee went back 
to the drawing board and revised the proposal to addres~ 
Ihese concerns .• 

Even though most problems were addresse<.l . some 
people will never be satisfied . For every legi timate worry 
about the schoo l there i s a patentl y ridi c ulou ~ objection . 

or ex ample, professor of economie~ Ross Starr <.:on -
t cnd~ th at each addi t ional UC eli g ihle gradu ate the 
schoo l produces wi II co st $ 170.000. 

While Starr':-. m ath is technica lly correc t. hi s basic 
premi !'.e I ~ flawed . It may be true tilat the program'~ $ 1.5 
million annual C()~ t will result in on ly ~even more U -
ell g ibil: :-. tudent :-.. but the other 53 studen t:-. arc by no 

mea n ~ a waste of time and mone . Each dollar spent edu-
catin g one o f these disadvantaged s tLide nt ~ i:-. an In vest -
nlcnt in tlte futurc - even if none of the ~chool 's first 60 
student:-. goes on to a U schoo l. Some stu<.lents wi ll 
enro ll in the SU system. some will attend community 
college, some will skip co llege and othcr~ will drop out 
of the program en t ire! - but no matter what they <.10. 
their years at U SO will have a profound impact o n thei r 
li ve, . Helping these studl!nt~ com e c l o~er to rl!alizing 
their poteilli al is a laudable goa l that should not he di~ ­
missl!d li g htl y. 

I f the 60 charter-hig h-school s tudents themselves <.10 
not justif the school 's exis ten ·e. consider the rippl e 
etTect. Every student has friends and famil y memhers . If 
we ca n motivate just f o ur or rive )1' these studcnts to suc-
cee<.l. and they motivate ju~t four or fi ve o f their friend~. 
the cumulati ve effec t wi ll be no thing short of amal.ing.

- but so <.lid the Supercomputer Center when it w:!!'.

We should not al low thi~ opportunit to pass us by. 
• ure, there arc concerns that t be worke<.l ou t - but 
Illany people believe in it. inc luding UC Regent Petl!r 
Preuss w ho has donated 500.000 to the project. 

UC D 's faculty m embers have a chancl! to truly make 
a difference - both for 0 and Stll1 Diego's disad-
va ntaged kids . They should vote "yes" o n the charter 
high schoo l. W e' l l all be g lad they did . 

Thumbs Down to last week 's anti-

People have a right 
to join together and 
bargain collectively 
with their 
employers. 
Nevertheless, It 
takes two to tango . 
If an employer does 
not want to bargain 
with a union, it 
shouldn't have to. 
Likewise, if people 
don't want to form 
or jOin a union, they 
shouldn't be forced

In a curious 
reversal, the most 
ardent supporters of 
laws restricting 
collusion on the 
part of companies 
ardently support the 
"right" of unions to 
"bargain 
collectively" with 
their employers. 
Collusion that 
benefits business is 
bad, while collusion 
that benefits 
workers is good. 
Consistency,

Horstmann said the hallots arc 

duc by June 4 at 4:30 p.m. and will 
most likely he counted the next day. 

The Academic Senate will eventu-
ally make a recommendation to 
Chancellor Roocrt Dynes hased on 
the rc\ults of the faculty mail vote, 
which may nol rcllcct Tuc.\CIay's vote.

Franz added that there are two 
major issues with which Dyne;. is 
conccrncd. 

"For thc ~chool to succeed. 
there would necd to be an indica-
tion of broad faculty support - but 
second, wc nced to get over the 
hurdle of linancial support," , he 
,aid. "'We need to confront thc 
is,ue of finam:es and whethcr the 
resourccs can he found to support 
the operation of thc ,chool over the 
long tcrm." 

The UCSD Charter High School 
would enroll 240 ~tudcnts in grades 
9 through 12, with approximately 
60 student, per gratle and IS ,tu-
denl, in eat:h cla,sroom. 

Student~ would take normal col-

lir,t three year, and would take 
~c lected CSD t: la~ se .. with regular

OBGANIZA'l'IONS:

The charter-school students 
would have separate aecess to labs 
and tutors. 

Each class of 60 tudents would 
consist of low-income, under-
achieving students who have 
demon trated high potential for 
academic success. 

Thurgood Mmhall College 
Provost Cecil Lytle aid that if thc 
proposal is ultimately approved, 
UCSD adminislrator will begin 
negoliations with Ihe San Diego City 
Schools District on the joint project. 

Lytle added that hc realizes the 
UCSD Charter High School is a 
unique proposal.

versities do, it is not something Ihat

Anagnostopoulos opened 
Tuesday's meeting hy repeating the 
Senale Council's objections to the

Anagnostopoulos said the lirst 
of the counci l's four objections is 
that the chool would not have a 
"noticeable impact" on UC eligibil-

able amount of money and "is like-

stay and insisted Ihey were staff 
memhers as well. 

Several union memhers spoke 
briefly wi th Dynes, who had just 
arrived for the ceremony. 

Beeson said the union memhers 
told the stalTthat they had no inten-

the ceremony. bu t thai they just 
wanted to be recognized as 
cmployees. 

Rogers Davis , assistant vice 
chancellor for human resources. 
then announced that the union 
memhers would be allowed to stay 
despite the dispute over their status. 
However, Beeson said the protest-

Academy Award winner Mira Sorvi-

the film tclb the story of two long-
time fri ends who return home for 
their IO-year high ~hool reun ion. 

Romy (Sorvi no) and Mi t: hele 
(Kudrow ) were mi sfit s in high 
,chool, hut they always managed to 
have a good time. They made thei r 
own punk clothes and took a joint 
high school yearhook photo. Their 
fun continued after graduation 
when the vacuous pair went hlonde 
and moved to a tiny apartment in 
Los Angeles. Ten years later, they 
slill make thei r own clothes and 
dam:e logether al Ihe c1uhs when 
they can ' t lind any guys. 

Romy. the slightly more intelli-
gent or the pair, finds out about the 
reunion. She dec ides that their lives 
aren' t impressive enough for the 
cheerleader·c lique that always 
mocked them in the past. The two

enough plol to create a whole 
movie, inserted an irrelevant 20-

in Ihe middle of the IiIm. 

"Romy and Michele 's High 
Sl:hool Reunion" tries to make a

thi s excruciating ly moronic film. 

The Los Angeles-based theater

Voodoo Glow SIaJIIs 
Baile De Los Locos 

Epltoph 

-*** 

Following the success of its 
Epitaph debut, Finlle, Ri verside's 
Voodoo Glow Skull s offer ' up its 
latest release, Baile De Los Locos, 
the hand 's rastest and hardest 
music to date. 

Departing from the more tradi-
tional "happy" ~ka. Voodoo Glow 
Skull ' combine hard-core punk-
fury wit h hyperkinetic. salsa-ti nged 
horn,. This, along with vm.:alist 
Frank Casillas", hellowing voice, 
results in an cxhilarating collection 
of intense, ferlll:IOU,\ tracks. 

Standout song\ on the album 
include the li rst sing le, "Bullet -
prooL" and "Thi, Ain't No Disco." 
The album's aggression is tem-
pered somewhat by the rocksleady-
ish groove of "Los Hombres No 
Lioran," one of three tracks in 
Spanish . 

Despile the compelling energy 
of Baile De Los Locos. the album 
lacks variation. AI times it also 
becomes too frenzied, losi ng con-
trol of it self. Neverthe less. it is sure 
to follow in the successful foot-
steps of its predecessor.

-** 

The self· titled debut of Fountains 
of Wayne fealures the ong-wri ting 
duo ofChri, Collingwood and Adam 
Schlesi nger. Together, they have crc-
ated an album of pure, unashamed 
pop music. Clearly, they have a 
knack for the craft. Every song con-
tains a hUl11l11able melody and guitar 
hook n::mini~cent of those from such 
pop-,ong mastcrs a~ The Beatie, anu 
The Beal'h Boys. 

Schksinga. who wr(1t~ the title 
track for the movie. "That Thing 
You On:' w ntinue, in the same 
vein with thi s album. The lirst ,in-
gle, "Radi ati on Vihe." is annoying-
ly catc hy - 'u much ,0. that II's 
one of those songs that will haunt 
you for the rest of the day. 

But what the album ha III 
melody, it lacks in lyrical content. 
Perhaps that is why the vocal deliv-
ery is so bland. It only shows that 
the band's work come from a 
recipe-for-pop-songs cookbook. 
The album is like a Hostess Cup-
cake without a filling . Fountains Of 
Wayne is so sugar-coated, it will 
leave you with a toothache.
