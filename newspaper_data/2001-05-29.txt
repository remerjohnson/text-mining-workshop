Faculty OK 
Increased 
Access Plan 
Program ensures 
j un ior college, UC 
admission 
By PATRICK LEE 
Staff W"ter 

In a W~dncsdJy \'Ot~ elf th,'11' sys-
temwide As embly of the Academic 
Senate, UC faculty stood firmly behind 
a proposal that would guarantee high 
school studen ts dual admission to both 
UC campuses and California commu-
nity colleges. 

In September, UC PreSident Richard 
C. Atkinson proposed the program, 
which would guarantee students in the 
top 4 percent to 12.5 percent of their 
graduating class admission to a UC 
school. The only requirement for thdr 
guaranteed admission is that the stu-
dents complete a transfer program at a 
California junior college. 

Faculty lauded the proposal, which 
would make it easier for top-of-the-c1Jss 
students to secure a place at a UC cam-
pus. Thdr approval was based on the 
conditions that there be adequate fund-
ing for support and counseling within 
the program, and that there be a method 
of evaluation for reviewing the plan's 
implementation and effectiveness. The last resting place of Wood 

was marked only by a simple piece 
of granite stamped with his sur-
name after he died in 1903.

New Major May 
Soon Be Available 
Bio-informatics combines comput-
ing and biology disciplines 
By CARUN WENDLER 
Staff Writer 

A new major, bio-informatics, 
may soon be available to under-
graduates in the natural and 
applied sciences. 

Bio-informatics, which uses 
advanced computing techniques 
to process the large da ta sets Ii ke 
those produced by sequencing 
the human genome, requires that 
scientists be adept in multiple 
disciplines and able to utilize 
new and sophisticated technolo-
gy. 

Their proposal was formally 
submitted to the Committee on 
Educational Policy and is awaiting 
a decision, which the planners 
expect in June. 

If approved, the bio-informat-
ics program hopes to start 
enrolling students in fall 
2001 , Only about 50 students are 
expected to qualify. 

The teaching in the program 
reflects the interdisciplinarian 

nature of the field and would be 
done by professors within the 
four sponsored departments as 
well as professors in math and 
physics. 

UCSD has a graduate pro-
gram in the field, but supporters 
believe that an undergraduate 
program offers students better 
preparation. 

"Much of biology will turn 
quantitative in the next decade: 
said Suresh Subramani, profes-
sor of biology and co-chair of the 
steering committee for the bio-
informatics major proposal. 

"We need a new set of indi-
viduals with new training in biol-
ogy, math, computer science, 
physics and chemistry whose 
interdisciplinary study will deal 
with the information and its 
applications. " 

The current challenge for 
bio-informaticians is to take the 
raw data abo'ut the sequence in

Students Put Plans 
for New Fee on Hold 
Committee to create a new fee 
referendum may be created in fall 
By GEOFF DIETRICH 
Staff Writer 

About two dozen students met 
Friday afternoon to discuss ways 
to approach the creation of 
another student life fee referen-
dum , which they hope to put to a 
vote next April. 

Members of the A.S. Council. 
representatives from the college 
councils, student organizations, 
clubs and concerned students 
decided to put the creation of a 
committee to draft the refGren-
dum on hold until at least next 
fall. 

Specifics of the referendum 
were only touched upon as the 
meeting focused on how to 
achieve greater student involve-
ment in the process and how to 
structure the future committee. 

·Our goal is for us to come up 
with a structure for another 
group of'people: said Liz Erwin, 
Muir College Council chair. 

That goal will also have to be 

put on hold until next fall at the 
earliest, as the group is still in the 
preliminary planning stages. 

.. I was thinking we were 
going to set up a group that 
would then set up an info ses-
sion," sa id A.S. Presiden t Jeff 
Dodge. 

"Right now I feel we are just 
in the philosophy stage," he said . 
"Honestly, I feel disempowered 
with this group." 

Many of those in attendance 
said they were reluctant to go fur-
ther due to what they said was a 
lack of representation of the stu-
dent body and a lack of leader-
ship. 

"I don 't think this is a repre-
sentative enough group to make 
some sort of presentation to the 
UCSD community as a whole: 
said a student in attendance. 

According to Kris Bohling of 
the Graduate Student 
Organization, anything decided

Admissions: 
Regents may vote on plan 
as early as July 
Continued "om .... e 1 
to expanding the scope of students 
studying on its campuses. 

"The University of California has 
always sought creative and innovative 
ways to increase educational opportu-
nities for the next generation of 
Californians." Atkinson said. "I believe 
that more must be done to recognize 
and reward high-achieving students 
from all areas and backgrounds across 
the state." 

Atkinson sees additional advantages 
to the program, suggesting that it might 
strengthen the University of 
California's relations with the 
California Community Colleges and 
extend the long-term viabilitY of the 
Master Plan for Higher Education. 

"Most importantly, it will send a 
clear signal to students all over the 
state, from urban and rural schools, 
from all ethnic groups and all socioe-
conomic groups, that they have a clear 
path to a UC degree." Atkinson said. 

The UC Board of Regents is 
expected to vote on the proposal as 
early as July. 

Brad Hayward of the UC Office of 
the President also seemed enthusias-
tic about the idea, even though the 
program's specifics have not yet been 
laid out. 

"We have to work with the com-
munity colleges to finalize the struc-
ture." he said. 

Hayward also commented on the 
difference berween this policy and the 
existing UC transfer program. 

"The main difference is that this 
[program] admits students right out 
of high school to a specific UC cam-
pus." he said. "A student would know 
coming out of high school specifical-
ly what route he or she can take 
toward a UC degree. It sends a signal 
that if students do well in their own 
high school, they are guaranteed an 
opportunity for a UC degree." 

Hayward sees potential difficulty. 
"UC will have to work individually 

with the 108 community and junior 
colleges in California," he said. 
"Working with these great educational 
partners will help us find creative ways 
to make this work." 

The Academic Assembly, which 
serves as the legislative body of the 
universitywide Academic Senate, is 
composed of faculty representing 
each UC campus. Assembly members 
include the chairs of the nine campus 
divisions, chairs of major university-
wide Senate committees and 40 rep-
resentatives appointed or elected in 
proportion to the number of senate 
members in each division.

Friday would likely be changed in the 
future as more people saw the pro-
posal. 

Because the meeting was formed 
by and for students, and not by a 
group seeking a specific agenda, no 
one group had control over the 
course of the meeting. 

"Until someone takes the reigns 
of direction, we can't go anywhere, 
and we can 't expect other groups 
come to us," said student Doug 
Hanes. "Someone needs to take con-
troL" 

Because a neutral chairperson is 
unlikely to be found, the possibility of 
a rotating facilitator for each meeting 
seemed to be favored over a chair, but 
participants discussed logistical prob-
lems.

BRIEFLY 
UCSD Biologist Wins Blasker Award 

UCSD biologist Julian I. Schroeder won this 
year 's $250,000 Blasker Award for 
Environmental Science and Engineering for his 
discovery of the molecular mechanisms that 
allow plants to remove toxic metals from conta-
minated soil. 

Schroeder will receive the award at the June 
13 ~an Diego Foundation ceremony. 

The Blasker Award is traditionally given to 
individuals or groups who have enhanced the liv· 
ing conditions of San Diego residents and other 
communities by creating solutions to an envi· 
ronmental problem that has already been select-
ed ~y the Blasker Award 's committee of 
experts. 

Schroeder fulfilled this requirement by identi-
fying the genes responsible for the transport and 
detoxification of such toxic metals as cadmium, 
arsenic and lead.

Two UCSD Students to Attend 
NASA Academy This Summer 

David Galvan, a UCSD physics major. was one 
of 11 students selected from around the country 
to attend the NASA Ames Astrobiology Academy 
at Moffett Field, Calif. 

Cari Goulard, a mechanical engineering 
major, was one of 16 students nationwide to be 
selected to attend the Goddard Space Flight 
Center 111 Greenbelt , Md. 

Students from space grant-affilia ed campus-
es, which 111 addit ion to UCSD II1clude UC 
Berkeley, UCLA and UC Santa Barbara, were eli-
gible to apply to the programs. 

The California Space Grant Consortium, 
which is housed at UCSD, contributes to the 
nation 's science enterprise by funding 
research, education and publ ic service pro-
jects. 

The 1()-week NASA academy's goal is to 
guide future leaders of the space program. Each 
student will be teamed with a NASA scientist 
mentor to develop and carry out a research pro-
ject. 

Students were selected on the basis of acad-
emic record, demonstrated motivation and qual-
ification to pursue multid~SCiplinary research.

Food Fight Debilitates Sierra 
Summit, Rathskeller 

Housing and Dining Services staff closed 
Sierra Summit early Thursday night after stu-
dents Instigated a food fight. Students allegedly 
organized the incident bye-mail. 

The Rathskeller was closed Thursday night as 
well, while beleaugared staff cleaned up tables, 
chairs and walls. 

The incident began around 6 :30 p.m. 
Students wielding oatmeal and eggs allegedly 
started tossing food, splattering bystanders and 
participants alike. 

Soon after it began, Sierra Summit employees 
tried to round up the students responsible, but 
the participants fled the scene quickly, leaving a 
mess. 

One Sierra Summit worker commented that 
the food fight looked like it was out of a scene 
from a movie. 

The staff was left with the task of washing 
down tables, putting out chairs to dry and deep-
cleaning carpeted areas. 

Because of the closings, hungry Muir stu-
d ts were forced to look for food in places 
other than MUIr College. 

However, Sierra Summit did open its doors 
Friday morning at its normal time.

_'PINION 

Population growth will synergize campus community 
By CLAIRE VANNEnE 
Staff Writer 

"( can't say it 's going to be won-
derful, but [ can say it will be 
inevitable: said Chancellor Robert 
Dynes in his March 22 State of the 
Campus address. 

The inevitability is UCSD's 
anticipated growth over the next 10 
years. It is certainly inevitable: The 
state requires the UC system to 
serve the top 12.5 percent of Cali-
fornia's graduating high school 
seniors. Nearly 60,000 new stu-
dents will descend on the UC sys-
tem's 10 campuses. [t is estimated 
that 10,000 of those bright-eyed 

high school grads will find their 
way to La jolla, bringing with them 
450 new faculty members and even 
more new staff members. 

Dynes' ambivalence about the 
growth reflects .the attitudes of 
many at UCSD, who fear that 
expansion will degrade academic 
excellence and quality of life. 
Although some may be "losing 
sleep" over the issue, as Dynes said 
he is, it is important not to become 
overly anxious about UCSD's pop-
ulation explosion. 

Far from lowering the bar, the 
expansion of our campus commu-
nity will galvanize our campus with 
new ideas, new opportunities and 

new challenges that will give us the 
chance to cement UCSD's reputa-
tion as a world-class university. 

[t is good to educate as many 
students as possible. People with 
the skills that a college education 
can provide, such as a sense of our 
place in the global community, 
communication skills, and techni-
cal knowledge in specialized fields, 
are continually in demand. Even in 
today's slowing job market, college 
grads are still desired in every sec-
tor. 

UCSD must share the responsi-
bility of giving new students the 
chance to succeed in ways that 
would be impossible or significant-

ly more difficult without a degree. 
This "burden" has many positive 
aspects that will improve life at 
UCSD. 

A larger student population will 
bring more points of view to 
UCSD. With the regents waffling 
about the future of affirmative 
action in the UC system, it is 
unclear whether that population 
will be more ethnically diverse. [t 
will necessarily represent a diversity 
of experience, because everyone 
who comes to the university brings 
unique backgrounds, opinions, 
pursuits and ideas.

Expansion would bring not prestige but more problems 
By LAUREN POPP 
Staff Writer 

UCSD initia lly appealed to me 
not on Iy for its reputation but for 
the anonymity it offered its nearly 
15,000 undergraduates. Coming 
from a small , private Catholic high 

sc~ool. . I hoped tha! such a large 
UI1lVersity would lack the gossip 
and politics of my small-town alma 
mater. 

Two years later, [ find myself 
struggling to find a happy medium 
between problems ipherent in both 
small and large campuses. While [ 

found refuge from the rumor mill 
that my high school had been, 
UCSD lacked the essential sociabil-
ity needed to foster a united stu-
dent community. 

Even now, I feel like just a num-
ber to the administration. There are 
simply too many students. With 
recent talk of UCSD's expansion, 
one has to wonder whether UCSD 
is ready for this kind of growth and 
if such development will be benefi-
cial to students. 

As a university, we have a lot of 
maturing to do before we confront 
the changes that will come if we 

continue to grow at our current rate. 
UCSD earned its prestige while 

still in its infancy, relative to other 
UC schools with much I<;mger-
standing distinction. This quick 
rise to prominence was largely 
because UCSD "filled a vacuum; 
producing graduates to support 
over 400 biotech companies within 
a 10-mile radius of campus. 

The problem with such rapid 
growth is that so much emphasis is 
placed on producing intellectually 
superior graduates . who have been 
put through such stringent academ-
tC training that their social develop-

ment has been stagnated or wholly 
neglected by the university. The 
pressure to succeed academically 
here is so intensified that the stu-
dents' social well-being is ignored. 

There are several obvious hin-
drances to establishing student 
pride and community at UCSD 
that make successful further exten- . 
sion of the school impossible. Pri-
marily, it is the five-college system, 
created ironically to help students 
feel united, that creates division 
among students.

Laziness 
is Life's 
Finest 
Pleasure 

Stop 
That! 

BERTRAND FAN 

T he other day, someone called me the laziest person he had ever met. Really, 
who's the lazy person in that situa-
tion? [ make significant effortS to 
meet people lazier than me so [ can 
learn from them and make my life 
that much easier than it is. This is 
partly why I decided to write this: 
to help you lead a happier, less pro-
ductive life. 
. That, and if [ ever get off my ass 

and head over to the Guardian 
office, they're presumably going to 
-give me $20. [ was actually over 
there last week, but they wanted 
me to wait 10 minutes to get my 
paycheck. Keep in mind they 
weren't paying me to wait 10 min-
utes, they just wanted me to wait. 

[f [ really wanted to be lazy, [ 
would have looked up lazy in Web-
ster's and written "Webster's dictio-
nary defines the word lazy as ... ; 
but then I'd actually. have to get a 
dictionary and look up the word. 
This wonderfully stupid technique 
was suggested by my 10th grade 
English teacher as a good introduc-
tion to essays. 

"Hamlet" is a good introduction 
to essays. Take whatever topic 
you're writing on, and relate it to a 
character in "Hamlet". [f [ were 
ever to teach a master class in B.S .. 
that would be lesson No. 1. 

B.S. is an important skill for any 
person trying to succeed in being 
lazy. It's what separates the run-of-
the-mill, white-trasb lazy person 
from the successfully lazy person. 
White-trash lazy people sit at home 
and watch television all day. Suc-
cessfully lazy people sit at home, 
eat Bon-Bons and watch television 
on a big screen all day. 

The important thing about 
being lazy is balance. You can't just 
sit around and do nothing all day. 
You have to find that happy medi-
um of doing the minimum amount 
of work to propagate your lifestyle 
of doing nothing all day. Let's start 
with everyday problems and work 
our way up to harder ones. 

You're hungry. What do you 
do? You have a few options. The 
average lazy person would just 
order a pizza. But then what? 
Tomorrow, you'll be hungry again 
and you might not have enough 
money for a pizza. Here is where 
preparation comes in handy. The 
secret weapon against hunger is the 
Ralphs' Big Buys section. All the 
things you need are in that aisle. 

At the beginning of the year, [ 
purchased paper plates, paper cups, 
a big box of "Crystal Cutlery" and 
40 White Castle hamburgers. 
Whenever [ get hungry, [ pop one 
of those burgers in the microwave, 
hit "66" because typing in "60" 
would require me to move my fin-
ger, plop it on a paper plate, and 
eat. [f I'm still hungry, [ repeat the 
process. . 

But take something more diffi-
cult, like a 20-page paper. [f you're 
a girl. you have your work cut out 
for you. Acquire the syllabus, figure 
out your professor's office hours, 
go to them, and then sleep with 
your professor. [f [ were a reason-
ably attractive heterosexual girl, 
and [ had to choose between a 20-
page paper and oral sex, there 
would be no contest. 

And if you're a guy, you've also 
got your work cut out for you.

America Impugns World's Ethics 
United States' glory days in the world theater are coming to an end 
By SIMONI! SANTINI 
Senior Staff Writer 

One day, historians will take 
one of two recent and almost-
unnoticed events and use them to 
mark the end of the "Pax Ameri-
cana;". the prominence of the 
United States in the international 
arena that characterized at least 
half of the 20th century. 

The two events are almost triv-
ial: [n the last three weeks the 
United States has been excluded, 
for the first time ever, from the 
U.N. Commission on Human 
Rights and from the UN. Com-
mission on Illegal Drugs. 

The immediate and conscious 
reason for these decisions is prob-
ably just to send a signal to the 
Bush administration. During his 
first 100 days in office, President 
George W. Bush has shown that 
his consideration for the interna; 
tiona I community is minimal, that 
his concept of alliances is hierar-
chical, with the United States at 
the top, and that he is willing to do 
anything to favor the penetration 
of US. business in willing or 
unwilling markets. 

The first signal has been sent 

strongly through the rejection of 
the Kyoto Protocol. The second 
came through the decision to go 
on with his defense initiative in 
the face of serious doubts from 
allies. The third came in his use of 
the World Trade Organization to 
bypass international legislation 
aimed at protecting small and 
local businesses, and to impose an 
American economic model on 
other countries. 

These immediate reasons 
could be dismissed as a fight for 
political territory; normal at a time 
when one of the most influential 
administrations in the world has 
changed, but the UN. decisions 
reveal a more serious and long-
term distancing between the Unit-
ed States and the rest of the West-
ern world. 

The decision to exclude the 
United States from the human 
rights commission, for instance, 
comes after years of concerns 
about our nation's human rights 
record. 

The rest of the Western world 
considers the death penalty a vio-
lation of human rights, especially 
when applied to minors, a practice 
used only by the United States and 

Iran. 
Lack of prosecution of police 

abuses, relative ly common in the 
United States, is also widely 
regarded as a violation of human 
rights. Police abuse is considered 
.normal criminal activity, but it is a 
violation of human rights when it • 
systematically goes unpunished. 

The decision to exclude the 
United States fro m the commis-
sion on illegal drugs comes from 
an increasing divergence of the 
"zero tolerance" policies, the 
"war on drugs. " and policies in 
the rest of the West, which are 
more inclined toward partial 
legalization and social interven-
tion, and opposed to jailing drug 
users. 

There is, in other words, the 
impression that during the last 20 
years, the social and political paths 
of the United States and the rest of 
the West have diverged consider-
ably. 

During the Reagan years, the 
threat of the Soviet Union kept the 
West together, but during the last 
10 years, the differences have been 
more evident. Further, Europe has 
been less willing to follow the 
United States and has been more 

prone to finding its own poli tical 
identity. 

Ultimately, the divergence is 
about the ethical foundation of 
government. The ultraliberal 
position of the US. economy has 
replaced the value system on 
which Western democracies are 
based, with an economic abso-
lutism in which freedom of eco-
nomic forces is the only surviv-
ing value. Other rights that were 
considered necessary for a 
human society are now subject to 
the domination of economic 
necessi ties. 

Life, liberty and the pursuit of 
happiness have been scaled down 
from ;nalienable rights to com-
mon goods. The new mantra of 
keeping government small and out 
of one 's life effectively transfers 
power from a democratically elect-
ed body to large international 
financial holdings whose opera-
tion are in large measure hidden 
from view and out of the public 
control. 

The ironic aspect of the situa-
tion is that the pre-eminence of the 
market is supported by the same

6 OPINION 

Pro: 
Expansion will be 
challenging but enriching 
Continued from page 4 

Diversity creates a vibrant envi-
ronment where students' precon-
ceptions will be challenged -
another important aspect of the 
college experience. The more stu-
dents we have, the more opportuni-
ties there are for personal growth. 

Conversely, an expanding stu-' 
dent body also enhances student 
life by providing more opportuni-
ties for social interaction. UCSD's 
Web site lists over 60 student 
organizations, from Cal Animage 
Beta to the Indonesian Students 
Association, from Darkstar to the 
Greek groups. 

These organizations represent 
a range of student interests and 
engage thousands of students, 
providing interaction and foster-
ing a sense of community. The 
more people we have participating 
in these organizations, the more 
students will feel connected and 
included. 

Adding students will enable 
many currently marginal interests 
to organize and bond. While now 
there may be only a handful of 
students who, say, enjoy sword 
swallowing, it is easy to imagine in 
a student body increased by 50 
percent, a Sword Swallowers Stu-
dent Union forming to give those 
future carnies a chance to meet 
others with their interest. 

With students often complain-
ing that there is "nothing to do" 
on campus and that it's hard to 
meet people, student life would be 
improved by an increased student 
population 

These incoming students will 
require adding new faculty. A larg-

er faculty has similar benefits to 
having more students. The univer-
sity would boast more diversity in 
its faculty in experience, gender 
and ethnicity, as female and minor-
ity graduate students are increasing 
in number every year. Opening 
new facu lty positions will enable 
the professorial ranks to more 
closely resemble the student body. 

Furthermore, the diversity in 
faculty interests and projects will 
enable students to find mentors 
whose specialties match their 
own. This will provide academic 
benefit by ensuring that all stu-
d.ents have the opportunity to 
fu lly explore what ignites their 
passion, encouraging their

achievement and serving their 
educational needs. 

Obviously, this expansion will 
be challenging. UCSD's already-
strained infrastructure will have to 
be expanded over the next 10 
years to provide more housing 
and dining facilities, meeting 
places and office space. 

We saw the results of adminis-
trative efforts to fund this rebuild-
ing: The Campus Life Fee Refer-
endum failed amid controversy 
over financial aid coverage and 
support of fast-food corporations 
in the proposed expanded Price 
Center. 

While students were unwilling 
to support this increase in fees, 
that does not mean that a better-

written referendum will not pass 
in the near future. It will be crucial 
for the expansion to be responsive 
to students, who understand what 
works better than some campus 
officials think they do. 

Other critics of expansion claim 
that more students will decentral-
ize the campus. This problem can 
be solved with careful planning 
and thoughtful programs. 

Increased funding for student 
organizations will be a boon to 
student life. Also, the preservation 
of the college system will ensure 
that students have the bonds of a 
smaller group while enjoying the 
sense of membership in a vast and 
exciting community. 

It is estimated that UCSD's 
student population will swell to 
over 30,000 students by 2010. 
The challenges associated with 
this expansion will provide us 
with the chance to innovate and 
to emerge as a leader among large 
universities - necessity is, after 
all, the mother of invention. 

Thoughtful, responsive 
growth undertaken with attention 
to and with respect for students is 
necessary for our success over the 
next 10 years. It is necessary to 
make sure that UCSD reaps the 
benefits of extending opportuni-
ties to thousands of new students 
.and creating new opportunities 
for students, faculty and the com-
munity at large. 

Dynes said something else 
about our impending growth in 
his State of the Campus address: 
·Sometimes I lie awake at night 
and feel excited, and my mind 
races about the things that we can 
do." 

This is the right attitude. All of 
our minds should be racing with 
the confidence that we can 
expand UCSD and create some-
thmg exciting. 

Con: 
UCSD cannot currently 
support a larger campus 
Continued fronI ..... 4 

From the drastically varied gener-
al education requirements to the 
inequality of the cafeterias. the five 
colleges only segregate the students. 
Spread out around the perimeters of 
the campus, each college is so geo-
graphically removed from the next 
that it makes it difficult to meet peo-
ple from other colleges. • 

With the plan to construct five 
more colleges at UCSD, imagine the 
likelihood of a student at Muir mak-
ing friends with someone at Eighth 
College, which will have to be built 
in East Parking or even farther away. 

This raises a side argument 
about where these colleges will go 
and how much land and student 
parking will be destroyed to build 
them. Will they cut down the 
forested area behind Warren until 
the trees and running paths there 
are completely gone? Or will they 
take over the ecological reserve at 
the cliffs and set up Seventh Col-
lege there? 

Maybe I am being dramatic, 
but these are well-founded con-
cerns: There is limited land 
around the campus on which to 
expand. If we were to expand to 
10 colleges, students would no 
longer identify themselves as 
members of the UCSD communi-
ty but as students of their respec-
tive college. This is because there 
is currently no universitywide 
pride to unite students. 

A second obstacle to uniting 
UCSD that makes expansion 
unhealthy for students is its loca-
tion. The demography and econo-
my of La Jolla is hardly conducive 
to a college community. Once stu-

Tuesday, May 29, 2001 

dents are moved off campus, which 
will begin a year earlier next year 
due to overcrowding, they are 
forced to spread out to surround-
ing communities where affordable 
housing is available. 

Since there is no central locale 
for the students to congregate off 
campus, they have no opportunity 
to develop a student community 
outside of their lecture halls. Fur-
ther expansion of UCSD would 
ultimately convert it to a commuter 
campus with a total absence of a 
student community. 

Finally, we need to consider 
what the administration hopes to 
gain from expanding UCSD and 
whether its intentions are in the 
students' best interest. The grow-
ing reputation of our undergradu-
ate program benefits UCSD 
because it draws influential scien-
tists and researchers to our cam-
pus, as well as grants for research . 

Working to get grants for 
research and publishing new find-
ings has begun to take precedence 
over teaching and education. This 
focus on research and development 
raises the question of why a univer-
sity exists. The purpose of a univer-
sity is to provide academic and 
social education - more than half 
of the college experience is learning 
about yourself and your own abili-
ties to interact and communicate. 

Until the · publish or perish" 
maxim is abandoned, professors 
are encouraged to care more for 
teaching, and UCSD finds a way to 
better unite its students, we have 
no business expanding. 

We would be wise to disregard 
the lofty dreams of eminence 
through massive expansion and 
place a more attention on students' 
needs. The university has just as 
much responsibility to cultivate its 
students' whole being as they do to 
cultivate their minds.

ORLD & NATION 
Blood Banl< Leaves Chinese 
Town Devastated by AIDS 

DONGHU. China - The 
most striking things about people 
from this vi llage are that their 
threadbare clothes seem way too 
big and that nearly all of them 
share a hollow, desperate look in 
their eyes. 

Stooped and shuffling, fra.i l 
before their ti me, farm ers who 
should be in their peak produc-
tive years are unable to tend their 
fie lds or to care for their chil-
dren. In this central Chinese vil -
lage of 4,500, every family is 
touched by gruesome maladies: 
fe,Yers, diarrhea, mouth sores, 
unbearable headaches, weight 
loss, coughs. 

Dozens of young people have 
died here in each of the last two 
years. 

The culprit that has devastat-
ed not just the health but the 
very soul of th is impoverished 
place is something that officials 
here in Henan Province have 
generally insisted is not a prob-
lem: it is HIY. the vi rus that ca us-
es AIDS. 

While hints of this secret epi-
demic first seeped out from 
remote areas of China's country-

side last year, the depth of the 
tragedy and its staggering toll on 
vi llages like Donghu is only now 
emerging, as desperate, dying 
fa rmers have started to speak 
out. 

[n Donghu, residents estimate 
that more than 80 percent of 
adults carry HlY. and more than 
60 percent are al ready suffering 
symptoms of AIDS. 

That would give this village, 
and the others like it, localized 
rates that are the highest in the 
world. 

They add that local govern-
ments are in large part responsi-
ble. 

Many farmers here in Henan 
contracted H[V in the 1990s after 
selling blood at unsanitary gov-
ernment-owned collection sta-
tions under a procedure that 
returned pooled blood to donors 
after plasma had been removed. 
Often, they had been encouraged 
by local officials. 

From there, the virus has con-
tinued to spread through other 
routes because these officials 
have blocked research and edu-
cation campaigns about H[V, 

which they consider an embar-
rassment. 

"Every family has someone 
who is ill , and many people have 
two or three," said Zhang Jianzhi , 
51, who gathered with others who 
have the virus in a mud-brick 
house here. 

"[ would guess more that 95 
percent of people over the age of 
14 or 15 sold their blood at least 
once: said Zhang, still stout but 
suffering from fevers and malaise. 
"And now we are all sick, with 
fever, diarrhea, boils." 

Officially, the Chinese gov-
ernment says it has only 22,517 
people in a country of more than 
1.2 billion registered as Hrv pos-
itive. 

But some Chinese doctors in 
the province said more than a mil-
lion people had probably con-
tracted Hrv from selling blood in 
Henan Province alone. 

They add that the sale of blood 
has died out in the most severely 
affected villages, but continues 
elsewhere to a lesser extent.

U.N. Expert Says Prevention Is Key 
to Winning War Against AIDS 

UN [TED NAT[ONS - Peter 
Piot, the epidemiologist who has 
been coordinating an internation-
al campaign against A[DS since 
1995, is spending less time worry-
ing about the price of drugs and 
more about the shortage of con-
doms. 

Piot said he feared that atten-
tion had shifted from the front 
lines of the fight, the thousands of 
communities where the most 
basic means of prevention are still 
beyond the reach of the poor and 
vu lnerable. 

"We feel strongly that the 
response to A[DS has to be a bal-
anced one: prevention and treat-
ment: he said. "[n the current cli-
mate, people forget that. I'm rea lly 
getting tired of the fact that a ter-
ribly complex problem of treat-
ment and care for people having 
Hrv is reduced to the price of 
anti-retroviral drugs." 

Those are fighting words to his 
critics. As the United Nations pre-
pares for a special General 
Assembly session on A[DS on

William j. Burns, Bush's new 
adviser, met with both Vasser 
Arafat and Prime Minister Ariel 
Sharon as Sharon's office was 
issuing a statement saying Israel 
was "nearing the limits of its 
patience" with its five-day-old, 
self-imposed, limited cease-fire. 

Speaking at Arafat's com-
pound in Ramallah, Burns said 
that he had urged Arafat "to do 
everything possible to stop such 
attacks: and that he would also 
urge [srael "to continue with its 

June 25 through 27, the first ses-
sion ever held to discuss a disease, 
a coalition demanding that access 
to treatment be declared a basic 
right is planning to demonstrate 
in New York that week. 

The coalition , the Global 
Treatment Access Campaign, will 
demand a war chest of $1 6 bill ion 
to fight AIDS. a cance llation of 
Third World debt and an end to 
U.S. efforts to protect drug com-
panies from patent challenges in 
poor countries. 

Secretary-General Kofi Annan 
has asked coun tries to create a 
global fund of $7 billion to $10 
billion above the current money 
avai lable for A[DS, which is now 
approaching $1 billion. 

Piot, a Belgian and an expert 
on Africa who was among those' 
who first identified the ebola virus 
and la ter saw some 'of the first 
effects of AIDS in Congo, said that 
before money on that scale could 
be spent in the poorest countries 
- if indeed it can be raised -
more effective prevention. testing 

policy of restraint." 
Arafat plans to meet again with 

Burns before leaving for Russia on 
Tuesday. 

Both sides have agreed to use 
the recommendations of an inter-
national committee led by the for-
mer U.S. Senator George j. 
Mitchell as a guide for halting the 
violence. But the [sraeli and the 
Palestinian leaders are at complete 
loggerheads over how to proceed. 

Sharon insists that all violent 
attacks on [sraelis stop fi rst. To 
ease tensions, his government 
announced on Tuesday that the 
Israeli Army would not initiate any 
operations and that Israeli troops 
would only return fire if lives were 
endangered. 

The [sraelis did not cease mili-
tary activity. There were incur-
sions into Palestinian-held territo-
ry and deadly shootings by Israeli 
troops. But [srael has not retaliat-

and delivery systems must be put 
in place. 

"Expensive health care systems 
are not necessarily the first or only 
priority: Piot said. "For A[DS, you 
need more than health care, you 
need the school system, you need 
all the communications." 

"The government sets policy: 
Piot continued, "makes sure there 
are resources and all that, but it's 
not government that's going to 
promote condoms in gay bars at 
night - nowhere in the world. To 
promote condoms you don 't need 
doctors. You use commercial out-
lets, all these kiosks with women 
selling soap, beer, cigarettes -
u,at's where people go for con-
doms, not to a clinic." 

At the grass roots, where many 
will never have access to anti-
retroviral drugs, condoms are also 
in short supply. "Not only male 
condoms but female condoms as 
well : Piot sa id.

ed so far for a spate of attacks that 
wounded more than 70 people in 
the latter half of the week. 

"Israel contin ues to show 
restraint, but is nearing the limits 
of its patience, since our utmost 
commitment is to protect the lives 
of our citizens," a statement from 
the prime minister'S office said. 

Burns met with Sharon, 
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres 
and Defense Minister Benjamin 
Ben-Eliezer in the prime minis-
ter's residence in Jerusalem. 

An Israeli statement said Burns 
had "expressed his appreciation 
for the restraint showed by Israel, 
despite the difficulties inherent in 
it." The statement added that 
Sharon repeated to Burns that 
"Israel could not indefinitely 
restrain itself."

u.s. and France Have 
Similar Tastes for Sex 

NEW YORK - Never mind 
those fantas ies of wild Parisian 
nights, those dime store novels, 
that Hollywood fondness for Le 
Moulin Rouge. 

Never mind the tall tales of old 
soldiers. 

Never mind, for that matter, the 
bravado of the French themselves: 
all that disdainful sniffing and 
snorting at American prudery. 

The truth is that while love 
songs might sound better en fran-
cais, when it comes to what tran-

Though a few intriguing differ-
ences were found between the two 
cultures, in most areas of sexuality 
the distinctions were negligible. 

The largest differences in sexu-
ality between the two countries, 
Gagnon and his colleagues said, 
appeared among those participants 
who were not living as a couple. 
and between women. 

Young French women who were 
not cohabiting, for example, were 
more likely to report having no 
sexual partner within the last year, 
and those who did have sexual 

basically the same 
in Cherbourg as 
they are in 
Cincinnati. 

Or at least that 
is the finding of 
researchers who 
compared sexual 
behavior on each 
side of the Atlantic. 

"But how people 
think about sex and 
what people actually 
do are really two 
separate worlds." 

contact were less 
likely than young 
American women 
to report multiple 
partners. 

Discrepancies 
were even more 
striking for older 
women. While in 
each culture the fre-
quency of sexual 
activity declined 
with age, American

have mistresses and everybody 
understands that and it's OK: said 
Dr. John H. Gagnon, an emeritus 
professor of sociology at the State 
University of New York at Stony 
Brook and the lead author of the 
report, which appears in this 
month's Journal of Sex Research. 
"But how people think about sex 
and what people actually do are real-
ly two separate worlds. ~ 

Gagnon and his colleagues ana-
lyzed data on heterosexual relation-
ships from two landmark sex surveys. 
the National Health and Social Life 
Survey, which gathered information 
from 3,432 Americans ages 18 to 59, 
and the Analysis of Sexual Behavior 
in France survey of 4,580 French 
adults in the same age range. Both 
surveys were conducted in 1992. 

Headstone: 
Wood's grave finally gets 
a proper headstone 
ContInued from PICe 1 
agency have come together to 
make sure that their first director is 
properly remembered. 

A black granite headstone that 
identifies Wood as the first chief of 
the Secret Service, the comman-
dant of the Old Capitol Prison - a 
Civil War jail for spies and provoca-
teurs - and a veteran of the Civil 
and Mexican-American Wars will 
be dedicated on Wednesday, the 
traditional Memorial Day. 

"We think it is fitting to take the 
time. to acknowledge our first 
director, the work he has done and 
what an influential figure he was 
not only in our organization, but 
also in the history of our country: 
said Brian L. Stafford, the current 
and 20th director of the Secret 
Service. 

Wood, a prominent Washington 
figure in the late 1800s, was hand-
picked to head the law enforce-
ment agency President Lincoln 
agreed to create the day he was 
shot at· Ford's Theatre. 

A contemporary sketch of 
'Wood, known as a dogged investi-
gator and interrogator, depicts a 
tough, square-jawed man whose 
techniques probably would not 
pass modern legal muster. 

"I don't know if he would cut it 
as director today: said Mike 
Sampson, the Secret Service 
archivist. "He was kind of gruff 

women over 50 were 
far more likely to be sexually inactive 
than French women of similar age. 
Seventy-eight percent of the 
American women over 50 and not 
living as part of a couple reported 
having had no sexual partner within 
the last year, compared with 52 per-
cent of the French women in the 
same group. 

"French women continue to 
have sex later in life than 
Americans.~ Gagnon said. 

He suggested that, in part, this 
might be because French men con-
tinue to see French women as sex-
ually attractive even as they age, in 
contrast to American men, who 
tend to pair sexiness with youth.

around the edges. But when they 
were starting out, they wanted a 
no-nonsense guy." 

During the Civil War, Wood 
repeatedly slipped behind enemy 
lines to gather intelligence and pro-
vide aid to Union prisoners of war. 
His post at the prison made him a 
target of Southern wrath. 

"The Confederates were deter-
mined to capture and hang him: 
said a lengthy obituary published 
March 21 . 1903, in the Washington 
Stflr. "Dozens. perhaps scores, of 
times he escaped from apparently 
inextricable dangers by his extraor-
dinary nerve, adroitness and audac-
ity coupled witJ:1 prodigious physical 
strength and activity." 

Wood parted with the govern-
ment somewhat unhappily in 1869; 
his obituary said thousands o( dol-
lars of claims with the government 
were pending in Congress at the 
time of his death in the local sol-
diers home. 

But his legacy --to the service 
lives on in the six general orders he 
issued to his first operatives, who 
were paid $3 a day. 

He wrote, "Each man must rec-
ognize his service belongs to the 
government through 24. hours of 
each day" and "Continuing 
employment in the Service will 
depend upon demonstrated fitness, 
ability as investigators and honesty 
and fidelity in all transactions. ~ 

"Those things are all still here 
with us: Stafford said. "He laid 
such a strong foundation."

Managing Editor 

Recently the U.S. Supreme 
Court upheld the federal ban on 
marijuana usage. arguing that the 
Co ntrolled Substances Act of 
1970 leaves no loopholes for med-
icinal marijuana usage, even in 
doctor-prescribed cases. 

The ruling's impact on 
California law will be undoubted-
ly widespread - 56 percent of this 
state's voters approved 1996's 
medical marijuana initiative, .,.Iso 
known as the Compassionate Use 
Act and Proposition 215. 

Medicinal marij uana clinics 
took root in various California 
cities as a result of Proposition 
215, and the Oakland Cannabis 
Buyers Cooperative, in particular, 
became a prominent player in the 
tug-of-war this initiative ignited 
between state and federal law -
the federal government sparked 
the soon-to-be Supreme Court 
case in 1998 when it began seek-
ing an injunction against the 
Cooperative. 

Several thought-provoking 
and sometimes disturbing cir-
cumstances surround the United 
States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' 
Cooperative decision. First, consid-
er the overlap in jurisdiction that 
inevitably exists here. 

Federal judges, who are well-
schooled in law, not medicine, 
have eliminated the ability of doc-
tors, who have years of training 
and experience in various medical 
fields, to prescribe marijuana to 
their ailing patients. It is highly

unlikely that Americans turn to 
their lawyers when they are ill and 
in need of sound advice as to what 
sort of treatment might cure their 
sickness. 

Here, the court has taken it 
upon itself to serve as every 
American's physician, yet the jus-
tices' areas of expertise reside in a 
far different domain than that of 
the physician. In short, the court 
has left no room for doctors to 
engage in an individual-based 
interpretation of needs. 

In short, the court has 
left no room for doctors 
to engage in an 
individual-based 
interpretation of needs. 

Furthermore, consider the 
freedoms with which doctors may 
prescribe other drugs, such as 
morphine and vafium, even 
though these are considered 
rather addictive, longer-lasting 
and gene.rally stronger than mari-
juana. It is ironic that doctors are 
trusted to divvy out these intense 
narcotics to pain sufferers or 
panic attack victims, yet the jus-
tices feel that AIDS and cancer 
patients tolerating any number of 
painful, unbearable conditions 
may not be trusted to truly need 
marijuana 's effects or really 
deserve them. 

It seems almost laughable that 
the justices are allowing surgery 
patients continued intravenous 

access to opiates while denying 
the chronically ill access to a drug 
that they - and their doctors -
claim is equally essential to their 
comfort. 

Also worth consideration is the 
1980s-style ideology espoused by 
this ruling: It states "Drugs are 
bad: However, America's half-
assed war against drugs is simply a 
dead topic, especially now that we 
have elected a former cocaine 
addict as president. 
. More importantly, drug usage 
IS considered "bad" or deviant 
only because it has historically 
been correlated to violent criminal 
activity. Labeling drugs as the 
cause of violent crime, and then 
launching a campaign against 
medical marijuana (which users 
argue is one of the most calming, 
mellowing drugs available) is a 
lamely constructed, roundabout 
w~y of throwing stones at high 
cnme rates. 

While it is true that violent 
crime may accompany drug usc, 
and it is agreed that fighting vio-
lent crime is a worthy cause, it is 
not true that all drug use insti-
gates or accompanies criminal 
behavior. Thus, it is not logical 
that banning access to medical 
marijuana will have any effect 
upon the fears that lay at the heart 
of the Supreme Court's decision 
and at the heart of most bans on 
drug usage - fears of violent 
crime.

this point might be too large a

Students Get Entrepreneurial 
Online business arises from undergrads 
By KATE COOK 
Staff Writer 

Two UCSD sophomores have 
created a unique Web site that 
helps students selling and buying 
used books to find each other 
online. Jeremy Jung and Jordan 
Brinkman, roommates and co-
founders of StudentListings.com, 
saw a need on campus for a sim-
ple and cost-effective way for buy-
ers and sellers of books to find 
each other. 

A little over a month ago,Jung 
and Brinkman were talking 
abo_ut the flyers that they always 
see posted outside classrooms 
and in bathroom stalls that 
advertise students ' books for 
sale. 

"All the . tabs at the bottom 
were always ripped off; Brinkman 
said. "It's ridiculous: 

The solution was simple. 
StudentListings.com is an online 
mediul!l for students to buy and 
post books for sale. Contrary to 
other sites of this kind, such as 
t e online bookstore 
ecampus:com, there is no risk 
involved. Posting books for sale 
is free and sellers can set their 
own prices. The Web site 
requires only a five percent sur-
charge from each sale. Since the 
exchange can be done in person, 
there are no shipping costs or 
taxes. 

For these two entrepreneurs, 
creating the site was a challenge, 
but a fun one. 

"It was more work than we 
originally thought; Jung said. 
"New challenges kept popping up." 

The entire process took the 
two computer science majors a 
month and a half. Designing the 
Web site took the bulk of their 
.time. 

Both partners have had aten-
sive experience in computer pro-
gramming.Jung's resume includes 
work at Microsoft as both a soft-
ware test ·engineer and a software 
engineer. Brinkman has worked 
for the Lawrence Berkeley 
National Laboratory on a project 
called the Human Energy Saver, a 
tool for planning more energy-
efficient homes. 

"I had a lot of fun creating the 
site; Jung said. "It was the busi-
ness aspect that was quite an 
experience." 

The process of creating and 
registering their business was 
done entirely over the phone and 
through the mail. 

"It took more time to actually 

Kenrick L~Guwdian 

figure out which forms to fill out 
than it did to process them." 
Brinkman said. 

Indeed, there were many 
details to cover, such as gening a 
business license, registering with 
the Internal Revenue Service and 
registering StudentListings.com 
as a legal business name. 

Jung and Brinkman poste.d 
their site on a separate location, 
http://www.Readyhosting.com.to 
ensure reliability and accessibility 
at all times. 

The service that their company 
provides is not restricted to 
UCSD students, but they're only 
marketing to this university. In 
theory, students from different 
universities could still use the ser-
vice to post and buy books by 
simply exchanging them in the 
mail.

Students of U(SD: 
Over the post few weeks I've hod the 

privilege to serve YOU the students of UCSD 
as YOUR AS President. Already having 
undergone SO many challenges in the office, I 
figured it was about time I send out a letter 

upda~ng students on what I've done lately. 
My main priority over the post weeks has 

been to GET ORGANIZED. An effective AS 
President MUST be prepored at all times to 
serve the students in whatever important 
fundion. Appointing competent committee 
representatives and stoff members has 
allowed to me to get a sense of the student 
body in a way I've never hod before. There 
are so many interests and opinions here at 
UCSD, my challenge has been to truly 
represent them all as best as possible. 

Lost week the we passed the 200 1-2002 
Executive Budget. I spent hours upon hours 
preporing this document to be as comprehen-
sive and concrete as possible. Altering figures 
and making changes, this budget is on 
accurate reRection of our goals for the next 
year. Translating the will of the students, I've 
mode some pretty important changes for next 
year. The biggest is a visible change in Fall 
Festival. Working with Eisha Christian, the AS 
Programmer, we've increased the budget for 
Fall Festival next year to one that's compo-
rable to this past year's Sun God Festival. I 
hope both incoming ond continuing students 
see this as a great opportunity to ' celebrate" 
the beginn ing of a great new year. In 
addition, the AS will hove over $30,000 more 

for funding student organizations here on 
campus. Understanding and appreciating the 
work of student orgs and their leaders, we're 
hoping that SOFAB will be just a little more 
generous in the coming year. 

lastly, I wont to extend on open 
invitation to all who are interested. I 
encourage anyone and • 
everyone to at any time 
approach me with 
issues, 
concerns, 
questions, 
etc. 
between 
now 
and 
the 

end of next 
year. I wont to be on AS 

President that is open and accessible to all 
interests and experiences on the campus. I 
hove office hours which I'll publish for YOUR 
convenience, but never hesitate to just 
randomly stop by my office on the third Roor 
of the Price Center if you need to talk or just 
wont to hong out. 

Thanks you again for the privilege to 
serve YOU the student body next year, it's 
with such high regards and honors that I hold

Ylr.o (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) 

Long-term relationships and 
deep emotional commitments may 
feel mildly strained early this week, 
Virgo. Don't be distracted: For the 
time being, loved ones may be pre-
senting a more negative view of 
relationships than is necessary. 
After Friday, letters, messages and 
unique phone calls may also be

The UCSD Guardian 

Horoscope: 
Much of the investment 
was time commitment 

The two roommates have found 
working together to be a positive 
experience. 

"It's nice to have a small com-
pany because you can just run to 
your partner and make a corpo-
rate decision right there: Jung 
said.

flirtations, if at all possible, Scorp: 
Romantic passions are now highly 
unpredictable. Continued from ,... 13 

There was very little financial 
risk involved for the twO students. 

"There is some start-up capital, 
but compared to a brick-and-mor-
tar business, it's minimal." Jung 
said. 

Aside from ban k fees, legal 
fees and processi ng fees for 
forms, the major inves tment was 
time. 

"We've definitely put a lot of 
time into it , but it's been a great 
experience so far," Brinkman said. 

They both feel that it will be 
worth it in the end. 

"If it all works out, then we'll be 
very happy." Jung said. 

In talki ng with their friends and 
fellow students, Jung ' and 
Brinkman have received positive 
feedback on their idell .

Jung and Brinkman have heard 
of similar business ventures going 
on at UCSD, but for the most part, 
they seem unorganized. 

For others thinking about creat-
ing their own online business, Jung 
and Brinkman suggest planning to 
spend a lot of time on the design of 
the Web site, as this was the area 
that required the greatest amount 
of time and effort. 

"Come up with an idea , design 
it, implement it, and you 're done," 
Brinkman said. 

After testing and perfecting 
their site 's design, Jung and 
Brinkman project minimal need for 
daily upkeep. 

Also, designing and ordering 
advertising materials takes time. 
StudentListings.com plans on 
using word-of-mouth as its main 
form of advertising, coupled with 
T-shirts, pencils and flyers. 

"We just want to get the word 
out because we provide a great ser-
vice that people should know 
about," Brinkman said.

accented: Expect rare communi-
cations from forgotten friends or 
distant relatives. 

UbnI (Sept. 23-0ct . 23) 
Before Thursday, a romantic 

flirtation may cause minor ten-
sions in a long-term relationship, 
Libra: Expect lovers or marital 
partners to now be highly sensi-
tive to social triangles or newly 
revealed romantic information . 
Little of this can be avoided: Pace 
yourself and wait for others to 
resolve past doubts and social 
regrets. After Friday, key money 
documents may require fast 
changes. Pay close attention to 
time commitments or long-term 
expectations, Libra: Don't hesitate 
to take quick action. 

Scorpio (Oct . 24·Nov. 21) 
Social messages and revised 

invitations may create unexpected 
tensions early this week, Scorp: 
Before Wednesday, watch for 
friends, relatives or loved ones to 
require extra support. Respond 
quickly to the needs and observa-
tions of others, Scorp, but reserve

SaCHta1UI (Nov. 22·Dec. 21) 
Romantic gestures and social 

invitations may be difficult this 
week, Sage: Expect loved ones to 
be unusually critical of new 
friends. Before Th ursday, both 
friends and lovers may publicly 
challenge the ideas or social needs 
of others. Don't over react, Sage: 
Private doubts or a complex emo-

be at issue. Next week, group 
events or planned activities will

and watch for valuable opportuni-

CaprIcorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19) 
Before mid-week, Cap, 

romantic celebrations and private 
social events are intriguing: 
Watch for loved ones to openly 
discuss controversial plans, rare 
ideas or long-term emotional 
goals. Some Capricorns may now 
experience the rapid expansion of

week, recent financial promises 
may require quick revisions: 
Minor debts, misplaced docu-
ments and forgotten bills are 
accented. 

Aqurtul (Jan. 20-Feb. 18) 
Social risk and unexpected 

family discussions may be a theme 
over the next few days, Aquarius: 
Watch for friends and relatives to 
now compete for your attention or 
issue unusual social ultimatums. 
Key concerns may involve busi-
ness schedules versus home 
obligations or creating extra time 
for private family events. After 
Wednesday, romantic attraction 
also sharply increases, Aquarius: 
Expect new overtures of admira-
tion and affection from a usually 
shy or reserved loved one. 

Pieces (Feb. 19-March 20) 
Quick reversafs are accented 

over the next few days, Pisces: 
Before Thursday, expect vague 
social promises and late cancella-
tions. Long-term friends and col-
leagues may now be feeling intro-
spective or forgotten by the group. 
Do your best to improve the social 
outlook of others this week, 
Pisces: Friends and work mates 
may now need extra encourage-
ment to change negative habits. 
Later this week, a past financial 
restnctlon will be lifted: 
Thoroughly document all new 
debts and partnerships.

romantic and social outlook. 
After June 21, many Geminis will 
begin an almost three-year long 
period of deep emotional change 
in all close relationships: Key 
issues may involve freedom ver-
sus restriction , outdated expecta-
tions and/or letting go. of past 
differences. By late September, 
long- term relationships that are 
intended to mai ntain a perma-

can expect several passionate 
new proposals. A vibrant and

Soapbox: 
Supreme Court ignores 
public sentiment 
Continued fronI PIC. 12 
pill for most readers to swallow, at 
the very least, the unanimous rul-
ing should present this question 
for discussion : Is the court 
removed from public opinion 
when it interprets the law, as was 
intended? It may be argued that 
the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' 
Cooperative ruling proves that the 
court is isolated from public pres-
sure, as it overruled medical mar-
ijuana usage even though Alaska, 
Arizona , California, Colorado, 
Maine, Nevada , Oregon and 
Washington all have approved 
such laws. 

However, it seems that 
America 's high court ignores pub-
lic sentiment sometimes, but not 
all the time, and that its isolation 
from the outside world seems to 
depend on the nature of the case 
being heard.

Corner: 
Padres and the Spirit can 
quench your sports thirst 
ContInued from ...,. 20 
go out and join the group. 

You can also take in some of 
San Diego's fine sports teams this 
summer. 

The Padres are red-hot, so go 
out and see what they can do. I 
think that the Friars have a legit 
shot at taking the National League 
West. Yes, you may think I am 
crazy, but the Padres have muchos 

huevos while the other teams in 
the division don't seem to be play-
ing up to expectations. Even if the 
Padres start to suck, you can at 
least see Tony Gwynn and Rickey 
Henderson. They are two legends, 
sure Hall of Famers. If you are 
really lucky, you'll get to see them 
play. 

If the Padres are not your cup 
of tea, head out to see the Spirit, 
San Diego's Women's United Soc-
cer League team. Those players 
are pretty good. They know how 
to put on a show, and their uni-
forms are always nice and clean. 

If yo u prefer smoke-filled 

The UCSD Guardian 

rooms, aging waitresses and 
cheesy games that take your 
money away, visit one of the 
5,000 Indian casinos in San 
Diego. 

Balboa Park is also an interest-
ing place to hang out. You can 
spend days looking through the 
museums and all the quaint little 
things it has to offer. 

There is also the San Diego 
Zoo and Sea World, but for me 
latter you have to sign over your 
firstborn to afford to get in. 

Another suggestion is to get 
some buddies together and playa 
game of sloshball. You can just 

get sloshed or just play softball, 
but sloshball gives you two for 
one. 

There are other things to do, 
like visiting the mountains to the 
east of here or heading out to the 
desert. Who visits the desert in the 
summertime? Oh yeah, I do. 

One final suggestion is just to 
leave. There won't be any power 
here, anyway, and the gas will 
cost $15 a gallon. Go to Arizona 
or Nevada. When the Big One 
hits, that will be prime coastal 
property. Then you can go to the 
beach and not worry about the 
crowds.

Reality: 
It was a great four years 
at UCSD 
ContInued froM PIC. 18 
~oodbye to school with grearantic-
Ipation, and most of you who aren't 
graduating are just grinding 
through your remaining years here 
until you can finally be in the situ-
ation that I am in right now. Not 
me. 

I am very saddened to say that 
this will be my final sports column 
here at UCSD, and the last chance 
that I have to .impart any kind of 
knowledge on the topic of sports, 
or other topics for that matter, to 
the faithful readers of Reality 
Check and the Guardian sports sec-
tion in general. 

This is a lot of pressure to put 
on me, seeing as how my lasting 
impression will be drawn from this 
article, and there is no way I can 
truly disseminate every bit of 
information to the readers that I 
would like. But here goes my best 
attempt. 

Things I like: friends, family, hit-
and-runs (in baseball, not in cars), 
the Dodgers, salary caps. going to 
UCSD sporting events, seeing other 
people go to UCSD sporting events, 
drinking. Las Vegas, drinking in Las 
Vegas. almost any college-level sport 
and being in college. 

Things I don't like: midterms, 
finals, hit-and-runs (in cars, not in 
baseball), the NBA, the San Fran-
cisco Giants, apathetic college stu-
dents who work all the time, get-
ting kicked out of Las Vegas hotel 
rooms and a graduation that basi-
cally means the end to the best four 
years of my life. 

When I am gone, keep the par-
ties raging, the beer flowing, and 
make sure you keep taking some 
time away from studying to realize 
that this isn't a time that you want 
to be missing.

Triathlon Gets Busy 
Team competes I n two events 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD triathlon team had 
two big competitions last week-
end, and both showed what Tri-
tons are made of. 

At the Iron man California, 
Armen "The Animal" Vartanian 
and Esther Merki strutted their 
stuff. The Ironman California is a 
grueling race, a true triathlon. 
The course consists of a 2.4-mile 
swim, a 112-mile bike ride, and, if 
that was not enough, a marathon , 
26.2 miles on foot. 

Vartanian finished the race in 
10:06:00, and Merki completed it 
in 11 :19:36. 

Salute:

Dillon said of the 5-11 guard 
from Mill Valley, Calif. "He was 
[also] a pesky defender." 

Miller was a team leader who 
kept UCSD in a 
lot of games. He 
was second on the 
team in scoring, 
behind Higgins, 
averaging 10.6 
points a game. He 
also averaged 3.8 
rebounds a game, 
led the team in 
blocks and shot 37 
percen t from 
three-point land. 

"He was a great shooter: Dil-

Vartanian's time qualified him 
for the Hawaii Ironman in Kona, 
later this year. 

Also last weekend, the UCSD 
triathlon team cruised up to 
Newport Beach for the Kring & 
Brown Newport Beach 
Triathlon . 

The event was much smaller 
in caliber, only half a mile to 
swim, a 13-mile bike ride and a 
three-mile run. 

UCSD tore up the competi-
tion, finishing first out of six 
teams in a time of 4:44:01 . 

Brendan O 'Brien led the way 
for UCSD, finishing 10th overall 
out of 730 competitors with a 
time of 1 :02 :56. 

Ion said . "He played with a 
tremendous amount of passion. 
He worked hard the last season: 

Miller, a 6-5 forward from 
Auburn, Calif., was a pleasant 
surprise. 

"Cole ended up here," Dillon 
said. "We did not know he was 
coming." 

Higgins, Martin and Miller 
showed what they were made of 

during the move to 
Division II this 
year. 

"It was certainly 
a difficult adjust-
ment: Dillon said.

weekend, the beginning 
of summer is upon us. 

Ti me to get out the white clothes 
and the bottles of 5PF 45. 

Yes. yes, for all of those scien-
tists and surnmt:r solstice people, 
summer does not officia lly com-
mence until June :!1. But fo r the 
r~st of us. this IS the beginning of 
three months of bliss. 

It is not so tasv for us here at 
UCSD. Most other academic insti -
anions have fi nIshed thei r year 
alreadv. while we have to suffer 
untillnld-June. Just remember that 
those other schools will re-start in 
August. though. while we're all still 
chillin' like those proverbial vil-

With vacation comes the

Of course, going to the beach is 
one activity that never gets old.

ormally, there isn't a bet-
ter time of year than the 
end of May. The weather 

starts getting nice, we start wind-
ing down the school year for a 
well-deserved summer break, and 
baseball is still in the stage where 
every team thinks it has a chance 
to compete. 

This year, however, is a little bit 
different for me. The weather here 
has been garbage (which for La 
Jolla isn 't a surprise). and many of 
baseball's races already appear to 
be over. Unfortunately, these are 
not the things that concern me the 
most. I am more concerned about 
the impending summer. Now, I like 
summer as much as the next guy, 
but this summer is going to be a bit 
different, because this time I am 
not going to be coming back to 
UCSD in the fall.

Six Triton Track Stars Shine

lyon Uew I Guardian 
.... p: The Tritans, lilce this member of the team earlier this year; stru~ed their stuff at nationals at 
Edwardsville, 1Il. 

By ROBERT FUUON 
Sports Editor 

The final active UCSD intercol-
legiate sport wound up its season 
this weekend when six members of 
the track and field team traveled to 
Edwardsville, III . for the NCAA Divi-
sion II National Championships. 

James Nielson, Rob Ewanio, 
Steve Pease, John Wong, Audrey 
Sung and Meghan Scott were the 
six athletes showing Triton pride. 

Just making it to this level was an 
achievement on its own, but the Tri-
tons who traveled halfway across the 
country did not rest on their laurels. 

The men had the most impres-
sive showing. Overall, the team 
scored nine points for 28th place 
out of 54 schools tha t scored. 

Pease was the most successful 
of those wearing blue and gold. He 
placed third out of 15 "Competitors 
in· the pole vault with a height of 
4.8 meters or 15 feet , 9 inches. 

"That was huge," said head 
coach Tony Sakrno. "He competed 
extremely welL" 

The top spot went to UC Davis' 
Tony Moore, who rose to a height 
of 5.35 meters, or 17 feet, 6-112 
inches. 

Ewanio took some aggression 
out on the shot put, hurling. the 
heavy ball 17.52 meters, or 57 feet, 
5-3/4 inches, which was good 
enough for fifth place. 

Ewanio's distance was not only 
a personal record, but also a new 
UC5D record as well. 

The top spot went to Curry 
Daweson of Angelo State, Texas, 
who shot the put 1-8.23 meters, or 
59 feet, 9-3/4. 

Nielson placed ninth out of 12 
competitors in the 5,000 meters 
with a time of 14:30.9. 

"He's been extremely successful 
for us; Salerno said. "It's extreme-
ly competitive." . 

The top time, by Michael Aish 
of Western University of Colorado, 
was 13:57.10. 

Wong competed in the 1,500 
meters, but did not make the finals. 

The women scored three points

Three Tritons Dribbling off Into the Sunset 
Michael Martin, Sam Higgins and Cole Miller are graduating in June 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The bouncing of orange rub-
ber balls on the hardwood at 
R[MAC Arena will be nothing 
more than a memory for three 
members of the UCSD men's bas-
ketball team. 

Sam Higgins, Mike Martin and 
Cole Miller are calling it a career 
after the three graduate in June. 

Higgins, a local boy who went 
to Torrey Pines High School, 
brought playing experience to a 
young bunch. 

"His experience was a great 
thing to have," said men's basket-
ball assistant coach Dave Dillon. 
"He played very comparable com-
petKion." 

Higgins was dangerous from all 
over the court. He lead the team in 
scoring, averagi ng 12.3 points a 
game. He also lead the team in 
rebounds, averaging 4.7 boards a 
game.

Lllter: (from left) Sam Higgins, Michael Martin and Cole Miller were all key to the Tritons. 

"He could score from inside 
and outside," Dillon said of the 6-
6 star forward . 

Higgins, whose father Steve 
once donned the blue and gold, 
was well-respected. 

"The younger players looked 

up to him," Dillon said. 
Martin brought all kinds of 

skills to the floor. 
"He has a good feeling for the 

game: Dillon said. "He was a 
tough player. n 

Martin could mix it up all over 

the court. His shooting touch was 
sweet, making over 38 percent 
from three point range and 85 
percent of his foul shots. 

"He did a good job offensively,·
