Her Majesty's first trip to California 
Queen Elizabeth begins 
west coast tour in SD 

By SCOTT YOUNG 

Queen Elizabeth II of 
England and her husband 
Prince Philip, the Duke of 
Edinburgh, brought their own 
s un hine to a rainy Scripp 
Inst itution of Oceanography 
Saturday afternoon, stopping 
for a quick hour in between a 
lobster lunch on board the 
USS Ranger, site of the recent 
contro\ersy temming from 
the allegedly wrongful death of 
an enli. ted man, and a trip to 
Balboa Park to 'ee the zoo and 
the Old Glob . 

rhe royal \ 1<;lt was part of a 
cro\\(led schedule of evcnts 
fill ing the agenda for the 
monarch's first visit to 
Cahfornia . San Diego was the 
lead cit) on a ten·day West 
Coast tour that includes stops 
In Palm Spnngs, Los Angeles , 
,' anta Barbara, San Francisco, 
Yosemite , acramento and 
Seattle, Washington . 

Meanwhile, about 150 
protestors gathered in Newton 
Park in downtown San Diego 
to demonstrate about the 
British presence in Ireland. 
Although the rain and wi nd 
dampened the prate. t , 
organizers stated that larger 
demonstrations were planned 
for Los Angeles and an

The yacht is 412 feet long, carries a crew of more than 280, 
including an admir~ and can be converted into a 237-bed 
hospital ship in time of war. 

One Secret ervice agent 
commented that, "~L'r urity 
measures here are more 
difficult because it is harder to 
restrict access to this area." 
When asked how many agents

Editoc: 

When I wrote my letter 1 
ex peeted it to be clear to all but 
the mait c nfused minds that my 
only "point" was that I consider 
the cockatrice to be ugly. 
disgusting. gm;s, repugnant. ..

justificatIOn because I intended 
no more than to gi\'e my 
opinion. There's no point in 
trying to convince anyone I'm 
uri :ht," all one ha<; to do is look 
at the atrocity and form his own, 
probably concurring, opimon . 
The rea.., on r wrote the letter was 
to vent my o\'erpoweringhorror 
at having been tricken with this 
hideous visage in a cheap but 
effective way. It was also an 
outstanding opportunity for the 
extemely rare pleasure of 
experienceing the overwhelming 
support of my peers. 

I hope it is nO\.v clear to 
everyone that my letter merely 

expr~ed my opinion and 
therefore required no justifica·

Evolution will probably go on

propose: 

The Earth wa' built on a 
planet far awa~ in the 
Horsehead Nebula by a people

was designed as a giant 
organic computer, so 
incredibly complex that its

Its purpose: to determi ne the

Question of Life, the Universe

is already widely known and

Third , yo u sa id that 
Prtsident ·elect Bashir Gemayel 
of Leban on was killed by 
Palestinian 'terrori'ils.' This 
statement is totally inaccurate, 
considering the fact that all of 
the evidence regarding this 
as"assination pomts direct ly 
t()\-\'ard a Syrian responsibility 
and toward no Pale;tinian 

r~ponsibility whatsoever. Even 
brael does not blame the PLO 
for thi" killing. 

Finally, you sa id that Syria

the PLO. Also not true. Syria

It. 

It occured to me last quarter 
to do something unbusiness· 
like and put on a tea for a 
phalanx of my most mter· 
estmg academic acquaint 
ances: professors, TA.... and 
undergraduates . The Real 
Men amongst the reader ... will 
think little of thi" idea, and no 
dou bt go off and get bombed on 
cheap beer In theirdisdain, but 
better men than J hme gl\en 
tea'i. Besides, they're always 
good for a few As. Since the 
obvious place to hold It seemed 
to be the haunt of the 10\ Ited, 
ll(SD, I decided to go and 
con<;u lt the opinIOn of the 
bureaucrats, who after all 

Here I played 21 queo.,llOn"

won, tt turned out that, Slllle

which sent me on to the place I 
was supposed to be, where a

a d07en ne\\ and more

It would be unkind to

I finally decided to put un an 
illega l lea, even with visions of 
my profes ors and other 
gue ts. china III hand. being 
pursued across the lawns by 
the.Campus Police. How many 
people have see n the 
regulations and have decided 
to go back to minding their 
own business in stead of 
stirring up the waters of 
ordinariness at UCSD? How 
many interesting event s have 
been aborted by the bureau· 
cracy, making the university 
just that little bit duller? 
Unfortunately it is impos ible 
to tell. Friend have warned 
me that if [ have any original 
ideas not to let the 
administration know. 

Without a change in its 
bureaucracy , UCSD will only 
become that vi lest earth to

The American Civil Liberties

made a motion to join the

several years before all the legal 
and constitutional questions 
concerning this law have been

Academic Senate approves 
plus-minus grading system 

AS tackles probletns 
cont inued from page 5 
Gon ged 

Show will begin today and will 
continue through the 
L !th ... On March 4 Revelle conti nued from page 5 

Adoption of this system will 
bring UCSD int a line with the 
grading systems of moot other 
UC campuses. Except for Santa 
Cruz, which has a basically pass. 
fail system. and UCSD until 
nCM'. all UC campuses have plus 
and minus grading systems. 

The propooal passed the 
Academic Senate without any 
students voicing concerns about 
the change. Student represent· 
ative to the Academic Senate. 
Marc Seecof. was not present at 
the meeting. and no other 
students spoke up during 
discussi on of the propooal. 

An announcement about the I 
new grading policy was placed in 
the AS Bulletin section of the 
Guardian a few weeks ago by 
Lee Anderson. student 
representative to the Academic 
Senate's Committee on 
Educational Policy (CEP). 
Anderson said that he only 
received sporadic responses on 
the issue. "Student input has not 
been unified on the issue," he 
stated. 

Anderson added. "As far as 
the propooal is concerned. I 
don't think it is that terrible. My 
support is by default." 

At the last AS meeting, the 
main objection brought up by 
AS members was the stiplation 
that _ tudents would only receive 
four points for an A-plus, which 
was changed before approval. 

On the grading policy change, 
AS President Henry Chu 
commented. "Personally, I think 
it will create more confusion. 
Basically, I am indifferent to it. 
It is not a big issue." 

This proposal was first 

discu~ ed la<;t spring by the CEP 
at the request of a number of 
departments. A quest i onnaire 
was then sent to all departmenl<; 
to discover how professors felt 
about this grading policy 
change. The survey findings 
showed that 16 departmenl<; 
favored the plus and minu 
grading system and only one 
oppooed the system. 

A couple of rea on were 
stated duri ng debate of this 
proposal for implementing this 
new grading system. First, 
with the plus and minus 
grading system, students wi ll 
have more marginal incentives 
to work for. Currently, a 
student has little incentive to 
improve his or her grade from, 
say. a low C to a high C 
because no actual gain is 
shown in the student's grade 
poi n t average. 

Another rea on stated for 
implementing this new 
grading system is that 
students will have less rea on 
to argue over test scores with 
the new grade margins. 
Student s with borderline 
grades will have less to gain. 
for example. by arguing over a 
few points on a test in hopes of 
receiving an A-minus instead 
of a B·plus. 

In other business. the 
Academic Senate passed two 
proposals for establishing new 
graduate programs at UCSD. 
The Graduate Student s 
Council recommended creat-
ing a doctoral program in 
clinical psychology . jointly 
offered by UCSD and SDSU. 
and establishing a masters'

These programs wi II have to 
be approved by tatewide 
educational committees before 
they can be implemented.

continued from page 5 
beginning the second week of 
March. 

Alt hough the Reg Fee 
Committee did approve the 
Program Rep I. it did not 
approve the Program Ass!. I, 
arguing that this position 
could be carried out just as 
well , and more cost effectively, 
by using two work-st udy 
students. Daigneault had no 
problem with this recommend· 
ation. 

The Committee tabled 
requests for the nurse 
practitioner and computer 
system until more information 
is received from subcommit-
tees looking into these areas_ 

The request of $] ,500 for an 
intercom service check and the 
remaining parts of the Health 
Center budget were approved 
as well. 

Next week Reg Fee members 
will take budget action on 
Counseling and Psychological

Library to autotnate 
conI inucd frolll pa!{e 5. 
ThIS is the only librar} [\c 
been in where it takes \TIe 
longer 10 check out a book thall 
it docs t () read it." 
- " I hate filling out these 

card.,. It ~eems that thi" 
university could in~titute 
rompl!!ers for such tiresome 
task ... . 

- "Your atrocious system 
for checking out bo()k~ 
demands to be changed. Please 
get v,:ith the 20th century." 

Under BLlS, students would 
no longer need to fill out 
charge cards. Library cards or 
even ro cards would be affixed 
with a bar code. a small 
metallic strip (like those used 
in some supermarkets). A 
similar bar code would also be 
affixed to books . Then. to 
check out a book .the person at 
the check out desk would 
merely feed the information 
into the computer by running 
a magnetic reader device 
across the bar code. 

Library personnel would 
benefit as well. Time, effort 
and storage space could be 
saved. Charge card would no 
longer have to be filed and 
updated by hand. At Central. 
for example. some 35.000 
charge card are stored in 45 
file drawers. All of this 
information could be stored on 
the microchip of the 
computer's memory. 

Soete noted that in addition 
to li sting overdue book:. and 
their respective borrowers. 
BUS might bcadapted toprint 
up charge cards ready for 
mailing. 

MELVYL. the UC on-li ne 
library calalog. though st ill 
incomplete demonst rates the 
obso lescence of the card 
catalogs nearby. MELVYL's 
sleek terminals take up much 
less space and gi \'e the 
st uden ts easier access to 
information. 

BLIS is primarily a 
cataloging a nd processing 
t>\stem. rather than a card 
cala log on a telescreen. But 
Abell hopI''' to sec a terminal 

combining bot h <,ystems. BUS 
i'i a local system. con ... i'it ing 
only of records from PCSO, 
\\" h'i I (' MEL \' Y l. con t a i 11 S 
records from the lline tiC 
campu<,cs. MEL \ 'YL is more a 
product. whi le RLiS is a 
processing sy<,tem. 

BLIS could be further 
expanded as a type of card 
catalog. BLiS might enable a 
user to see If a desirro book not 
on fi le was recentl y ordered 
and when it is expected to 
arrive. Or. it could show 
whether or not a given book 
was checked out, thereby 
saving walking time if that 
book was in a different cluster. 

£( a student really needed a 
certain book t hat was checked 
out, a "blind message" could 
be sent to the person with the 
book. whose confidentiality 
would be maintained. to let 
him or her know the urgency 
required in ret urning the book. 

BLlS's 50 terminal would 
also allow greater dispersion. 
Since one compact terminal. 
rather than a complex of card 
catalog fi les, is needed . they 
can be placed anywhere. 
Terminals could be placed on 
every floor of the library , 
ins tead of jus t on the ground 
floor. Eventually, terminals 
could be placed in dorms. 
offices and other areas outside 
the library. which are more 
accessible to the public. 

BUS would be im'aluable to 
library sta ff as a tool to help 
them catalog and keep records 
of all their books. RLiS could 
be consulted to see which 
books the library needed or 
already had w"~n ordering 
new books. without having to 
look through as many as eight 
different files . 

The index cards in the card 
cata log wou ld no lor.ger have 
to be continually updated by 
hand . Recent lv. the inter· 
national gU(delines for 
cataloging changed . In . tead of 
filing authors under their real 
names. such as Samuel 
Clemens. t he\ are now filed 
under theIr published names.

Search committee selects 
Utah's Gardener UC Prese 
continued (rom page 1 
co m mi t tee presents its 
nomination at a special session 
of the board schedu led for 
Wed nesday. 

Educated at Brigham Young 
Universi ty and UC Berkeley, 
where he earned a masters in 
po litical science and a 
doctorate in higher education, 
Gardener is a Mormon who 
teaches Sunday school and 
wi ll reportedly not accept 
engagements on Sunday. 

Queen Elizabe th and Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh. 

If named, Gardener would 
be the 15Lh UC presidenL, 
over eeing the nine campuses, 
five medical schools and a 
budget of $4 billion. He was 
one of a handful of finalisLs in 
the 1975 search which 
elevated Saxon from UCLA 
administrator to the top 
systemwide post. 

He is married wilh four 
daughter s, and has won 
numerous academic honors 
and appointments, including 
the chairmanship of the 
federal educational think 
tank , the National Commis· 
sian on Excellence in 
Education. 

p leased wi t h the search 
committee's choice, but they 
remain bitter about the 
process itself. The only 
representation students were 
given during the four·month· 
long search was through 
Student Regent Linda Sabo, 
who was only invited Lo 
particpate as an ex officio 
member at the insistence of 
the SBPe. (Sabo has said all 
along, however, that her input 
has been respected by ot her 
board members, and her vote 
was in fact counted during the 
selection process. "f just put 
my hand up and hoped for the 
best." she said.) British 

monarch 
travels to 
west coast 
continued (rom page 1 
of the rare Neopolina galalheae, 
a representative of an ancient 
class of molllsks." The Queen, 
whose expression never 
changed during the entire 
speech, accepted the gifts 
graciously. 

After his years at UC Santa 
Barbara, where he won 
acclaim for his research on the 
Un iversity loyally oath 
controversy of the 1950s, 
Gardener in 1971 was named 
vice president of UC'scentral 
administration. In 1973 he 
assumed the presidency at 
Utah , a university of 
approximately 25,000 stu· 
dents with a budget of $287 
million . 

There he has earned a 
reputation for being "h ighly 
accessible" and "totally 
atypical of mu · t high 

administrator~" accordmg to 
a sLaff member uf the 
UniversiLY of Utah's student 
newspaper. He is also lauded 
as being open minded and not 
one to let his fundamentahst 
religi ous vIews influence his 
administrative duties 

"There's no question that 
from the begi n ning, t he 
Regents simp ly had the 
attitude that students, or kids, 
aren't qualifies for such a lofty 
task as finding a president," 
said Campbell. "There was a 
real non·tru t on the pa'r-t of 
the board, and we were left out 
in the dark on everything." 

Consistent complaining, 
Campbell believes, got the 
message across, and SBPC 
members meeting wiLh Saxon 
and board members last week 
finally won some concessions. 

After the talk and 
presentation, the Queen and 
her husbanc jumped into their 
black limou ine, and left for 
Balboa Park, leavlI1g behind 
the press and the rain. At thIS 
poinL, LUlldoll Times corres· 
pondent Nicholas Asheford 
commented, "The \·isl! was 
fine. but the Times ~!1l1 gIve:, 
her hat a C." 

Queen Elizabeth and William A. Nierenberg, Scripps' direc-
tor, look over a special volume of photos o( beautifully colored 
"udibrQllcI,s (sea slugs), 

" I think we did very well," 
said Campbell. "ft sounds like 
he's in tune with students." 

SBPC members may be 

" [ think they finally saw IL 
our way, and they (Regents. 
UC administrators) haYe 
agreed to meet WIth u~ 
sometime in thc next \car to 
set down some gUIdelines for

Campbell said. "Sti ll. it's

Hot plates, paper cutlery just won't do 

By JAMES RALPH PAPP 
Staff Writl.'r 

Pa rt One 
A few weeks ago. a small 

letter to the editor appeared 
a bove a n enormous beer 
advertisement In The 
Guardiall, complaining that 
we had no "column devoted Lo 
cooking and the sharing of 
recipes." Our edItor noted to 
EII;r,abeth Rlchardsun. \\ ho 
was the wlm;tle·hlo\\(')' in thIS 
ca"e, that therl' I ... no "pace for 
a n·gular column. ~o doubt 
thi ... IS true. but S 111 Ct. • ..,pall' 
s(-'ems to eXI ... t for Ilh' to bl' 
prell y t'xpanSI\t' (-'\'er~ \\ eek. 
and I can Ill'\cr thmk of 
anythmg to \\'rite about (as my 
friends frequent Iv point out to 
me), the following column will 
devote itself Lo the dis('usssion 
which Miss Richardson 
\\ Ished for: campus cuisine. 

Mi~s RIChardson savs that a 
lot of students are faced for the 
first time WIth prepanng theIr 
own meals, ancl that thev need 
suggest Ions for "eao,lly 
prepared, nut rit ious. Inexpen· 
sin'. yet tasl} . recipe ... . " l. 
"Who, by t IX' art of known and 
feeling sornm s. Am pregnant 
to good pit Y'," (};lIIg L£'(I r. ] V, 
\ i). shall try to flOd an an"wer. 

But first, Miss Richardson 
must drop some of her 
demands. The only things 
which are "easily prepared" 
are omelettes and sa lads. The 
only advice one can gIve for 
omelettes is don't use more 
t han four eggs, and use spices 
imaginaLively; eggs have little 
appeal by themselve ·. One 
probably does not need more 
than abouL thirty spices, and 
this is like Lucius Beebe (of t he

High tea IS an enigmatic

people behe\'e that it must last

began at four·th irty and from 
which the guests did not leave

problem with this is that one 
cannot change from morning

This Week in Intramurals 
By JEFF SCHAPIRO and 

GREGORY MacCRONE 
Playoffs, according to the 

/llustrated Heritage Dictionary 
and Information Book, are 
"series of game played to 
determine a championship." 
Yet, to the participants of 
intramural sports, they also 
mean glory, self·sa tisfaction , 
and a team picture on the wall 
of the 1M office. It is these 
fruits of the regular sea on's 
labor that many teams are 
contending for now. 
eBasketbali 

Coming Attractions, 
shooting for a si ngle ·A 
Budman ranking, played two 
games this past wee~ , 
winnning both of them. Their 
first game, rescheduled from 
last week, was won by a 
margin of 15 points, as The 
Really Bad Team lived upto 
its name by losin~ 50·35. The 

Attractions' second victory 
in the regularly scheduled 
game was at the expen~e of 
Air Balls. The Attractions 
banged the Balls by a score of 
44·14 . 

[n AA action , an exciting 
game between Russian 
Roulette and Box Lunch 
saw the previously undefeated 
Ru skies tasting defeat , 53·51. 
Box Lunch was led by Jeff 
Golden and AI Friedman, who 
scored 26 and 16 point s, 
repsectively. They say that it 's 
lonely at the top, but such is 
not the case here, as there is 
current Iy a three·way tie for 
firs t place between these two 
teams and the TKE team. In 
other action Midnight 
Express beat Scripps II. 
Mark Sloan and Kevin Carter 
scored 19 and 15 points apiece 
in helping the E~press not~h 
another mark In the Win 

column. 
On the AAA side of things, 

Secondary Lues a nd 
Riley's Hair went at it. The 
re ult was that another 
previously undefeated team's 
record was blemished. The 
Lues took the game, 42·40, 
and in so doi ng helped 
themselves to a share of first 
place. Bot h teams are now 5· 1. 
eSuperstars "fdate 

The Boston Celtics looked to 
be a little disinterested in 
playing San Diego one night 
after they had destroyed the 
World Champion Lakers. The 
Clippers were without injured 
Tom Chambers, a 6· 10 
intimidating forward, so they 
started Michael Brooks in his 
place. A sellout crowd saw our 
San Diego Clippers literally 
out·muscle Boston 122·107. 
The Clippers fouled, hacked, 
low bridged and scratched -
and were often called for it. 
But the effect on the Ce[tics 
was devastating. All Boston 
players were looking to the 
Clippers bench with a look of 
contempt , a look of hatred, a 
look of having drunk sour pre· 
game milk . 

V-baIlers win back-to-back 

The annua Super tars 
competition got underway this 
past Thursday, and as of 
events through Friday, this is 
the "closest, most hotl y 
contested Superstars" ever. 
Several records have already 
fallen . Tim Egan set a new 
weightlifting/ bench pre ss 
record by lifting 310 pounds. 
Female competitor Jody Mai 
also accomplished a first by 
kicking five field goals in five 
attempts for a cumulative 92 
yards. In bowling Len 
Shulman rolled a 216, while 
hi s counterpart Gayle 
Flanders scored 181. Indivi· 
dual competition has been in 
events such as weightlifting, 
field goal kicking and bowling, 
as well as in the softball throw, 
the 50·yard freestyle swim and 
the 6O·yard dash. 

Terry Cummings scored 25 
points', pulled down 14 
rebou nds, and played an 
incredibl y physical basketball 
game. Lionel Holl ins scored 24, 
Bill Walton 22. For omeone 
who is listed at 6· 11 and who is 
aid to be partially lOcapaci· 

tated because of an inj ury, 
Walton IS unrea sonably 
intimidating. He moves like a 
power forward, hoots like a 
sma ll forward, block hots 
and rebounds as well a

Staff Writer 

Coming out of what Coach 
Doug Dannevik termed "the 
best match a UCSD men's 
volleyball team has ever had ," 
a 15·12, ]5·10,16·14 victory at 
Loyo la Mar ymount , the 
Tritons beat UC Riverside in 
their worst showi ng of the 
eason, 15·7, 13· 15, 12·15, and 

15·8 in the Main Gym 
Saturday. 

The contrast bet ween 
Tuesday's grudge match with 
Loyola a nd aturday's 
exhibition was remarkable. 
These wins make the team 's 
record 7· 11 , but they do little 
else. Dannevik's sentiments 
on the t \\ 0 contests were 
diametrIcally opposed. In the 
Loyola match "everyone 
played well," but "no one 
played well against UCR." 
The awful play was mainly

attributed to a mental 
weaknes that has developed 
on the team. After playing so 
tough and so awesome when 
they needed to against tough 
competition such as Loyola, 
and winning, the club 
ex perienced a let·down which 
carried into a match they 
knew they could easi ly win. By 
chance UC Riverside, t he 
worst team in the league, had a 
good night, so that did not help 

CSD either. It was obvious 
that the entire match was a 
classic example of playing at 
the ability leve l of one's 
opponen ts. 

Game action with Loyola 
was smooth until the third 
game when the Tritons were 
down 11 ·3. Thev were able to 
come back to tie the score at 14, 
and finally won the game and 
match, 16· ]4. 

SomethIng of a Dr. Jekyll 

(rrtlflCalr 

and Mr. Hyde effect was 
present by Saturday though. 
In game one play was slow but 
UCSD was by no means 
ineffective as the 15·7 score 
indi cates. Th e team's 
problems in game two were a 
bit more noticeable as the 
errors in pa ing and erving 
became more frequent; this 
game was lost 13· ]5. By game 
three Dannevik had put in all 
the rookies in hopes of 
reversing the results of the 
previous game. This did not 
work and t hey lost 12· 15. The 
starters were put back in for 
the last two games, regaining 
control and composure to win 
15· 7 and 15·8. 

Next week the Triton 
spikers will take on La Verne 
and UC Riverside, bot h for the 
second time this season. 
Mental toughness wi ll be the 
key to succes . 

Standings through Friday 
looked like this: 
Six events completed 

1. Randy McNicholas -

2. Gayle Flanders -

Running Thoughts 
By MIKE GREENBERG and JEFF SAVAGE 

Staff Wriler& 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. Tomorrow marks a 
big day for professional women's basket ball. At the Forum in 
Inglewood , Nancy Lieberman's West sq uad will take on an 
Eastern team in the first of seven national women 's basketball 
game that will tour the country. Lieberman is putting the 
package together hoping t'hat with the best fem ale players in the 
world in action fan interest will be high . Of course, the WBL had 
a stint a few years ago, but fans just didn't want to give their 
support. Apparently, many people felt that the women's game 
resembled the men's too much, and why s hould they pay to see 
an inferior product? Lieberman is trying to change tha t attitude. 
"People have to realize that the women' s game is a far different 
one than the men's," said the highest paid player in the sport. 
"Once they realize and accept this, then they will appreciate the 
game a lot more." Hopefully this game as well as the rest of the 
seven game tour will draw support, otherwise we might not see 
professional women's basketball in the United States for quite 
some time. 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT. Basketball has the most 
interesting contract clauses. Here is a sampling: The 
Washington Bullets must provide guard Kevin Grevey with four 
tickets to the Indianapolis 500 each year or else forfeit $10,000. 
The Philadelphia 76ers don't have to pay Julius Erving his 
$100,000 annual salary if he is injured hang gliding. The Phoenix 
Suns have worked out a deal recently that stipulates that guard 
Walter Davis will lose his guaranteed contract if he is: a) hurt 
while dueling; b) hurt while riding in a crop-dusting plane; or

WAIT A MINUTE DEPT. Quick, place these seven ladies 
and tell us what group they comprise: Kathy Berman, Valerie S. 
Anders, Denise Schautz, Kindra Zieber, Melissa Velis, Alison 
Jamieson, and Lori Grindas (aka Grindicas). If you guessed the 
UCSD cheerleaders. you win a free dinner with Ted Leitner and 
his ego. This is only the second year that UCSD has had 
organized cheerleading, and the ladies suffer like the rest of t~e 
intercollegiate program by having to pay up to $300.00 for their 
uniforms, pom·poms, etc. Talking with the group, we learned 
that cheerleading isn ' t all what it is cracked up to be. There are 
long hours of practicing routines, and according to one member, 
"a two hour game is the equivalent to working out at famil y 
fitness for the same time period." Although UCSD is far from 
being a high·spirited school like, for instance, UC LA, these 
cheerleaders liven up what would otherwise be dull timeouts, 
halftimes , and pregame warmups.

UCSD eyes playoffs frOnt afar Men's hoop 
Don Bickett got tree lor an 
instant and poked a three· 
footer through as Mike Maross 
was fouling him. Bickett 
missed the free throw for the 
lead. but Maross committed a 
silly foul during the shot to 
give the Crusaders the ball 
right back. Richards made the 
most of it by converting an 
eight-foot jum!)er. A Triton 
miss and another Richards 
jumper from the same spot put 
Pt.Loma up to stay at 5!i·51. 

continued from page 13 
82 points as well as 25 of the 
squad's 42 rebounds, It was a 
sweet win for the Tritons 
since the two schools have had 
an intsense rivalry the past 
few years, Winning two of the 
three games in the season 
series, the last one being a 
blowout, had to feel good to the 
women in the white uniforms, 
"It was a fun game to play in, " 
said point guard Brenda 
Sweatt. "It was good to beat 
them the way we did ," If only 
UC 0 had displayed the same 
kind of magIc the following 
night that they exhibited 
agalllst Point Loma, their 
playoff possibilities wouldn 't 
be so remote. 

But SD i a Divisi n I 
team, and even though they 
entered Saturday's contest 
with a 7-16 record, they 
displayed a tough inside game 
that they have built a 
reputatIon for . Led by IX fool 
power for\\' a rd Ji 11 Brad ley's 26 
points (18 of which came in the 
second half), the Torreros 
ne\'er trailed. Michelle 
Dykstra , a 5·9 foward. paced 

nWIlh 15 0ftheclub 's first 
half points, most of them 
coming from the im"ide of the 
ke y. Down by fi\e at 
intermIss ion , the Tritons 
fought back, managing to knot 
the ballgame up at 31, 33, 35, 
and :37. But the UC D offense 
that had worked so profi· 
cientl y in pa s t outings, 
malfunctioned in the next 
4:45. During that pan , the 
Torreros o ut sc ored the 
Triton s 11-1 to take a 
commandtng 4 ·37 ad\'antage 

that would never be 
threatened again. "They were 
the strongest inside team we 
faced all year," said forward 
Jennifer Gregory, who went 
head·to·head with most of 
USD's enforcers. "We had 
trouble getting rebounds, and 
when we don't rebound we 
can't execute our fast break." 

Despite closing out the 
ea on on a losing note. and 

posibly not making the 
playoffs because of it , one has 
to feel that UCSO's future is 
bnght and \'Cry promising. 
After all. all fl\e starters will 
return to a team that boasts 
three freshmen . four soph· 
mores, four junior", and a 
coach who instill s a wmning 
attitude . Even if UCSD 
receives a playoff berth, it 
would merely be more frosting 
on the cake for a ballclub that 
did the unexpected thIS year: 
win more game!> (17) than an y 
Triton team previously .

an eight point deficit is mind 
blowing. 

Led by the inside scoring 
and the remarkable defenseive 
play of freshman Deon 
Richard , PI. Loma main-
tained a izeable lead 
throughout much of the 
econd half , and with only 

seven minutes to go was still 
leading by eight at 49-41. , 

In the la. t 90 seconds the 
teams traded two baskets 
apiece settling the issue in 
Crusader fa\'or 59-55. 

"We didn't play smart ," said 
a dissappointed Goodman 
after the game. "Against a 
good team you can only make 
so many mistakes." The~ 
didn't make many mistake" in 
the turnover column (only 
nine), but perhaps Goodman 
was speaking of the many 
hurried shots UCSD threw up. 
If he wasn't he may as well 
have been . Nixon was only one 
for five on the night but morc 
importantly , Banales hit on 
only two of eight. Said Coach 
John Block. "We played hard 
tonight, but we didn't play 
smart hard." 

Clippers win and lose 

The Tritons had been awake 
throughout the game, but they 
finally decided to get ou t of bed 
and produce. Goodman began 
the rally with a smoot h flip 
shot off t he glass to close to 
within six at 49-43. After a 
steal, Goodman lobbed the ball 
into McGuire, who hit his only 
basket of the night. a 
turnaround four-footer in the 
lane. McGuire fou led Richard~ 
on the other end but both free 
throw attempts were mi sed. 
The Tritons pushed the ball 
up in a hurry, and Hicks 
banged in a 20-footer to slice 
the Crusader lead to a thin 
two. After a rat tied Richards 
missed a wide open fivc-footer 
by a yard, Hicks . cram bled up 
court and fed a streaking 
Brandon ixon who missed a 
hurried layup, but Goodman 
was there for the follow and 
the tie. It didn 't stop there. Pt. 
Loma's Paul Walker missed 
from fifteen and McGuire 
boarded. An outlet to 
Goodman, who found Ilicks on 
the left side, led to Ron's 
rainbow from twenty one, and 
just like that - ten straight 
and a Triton lead. Ho hum . 

Coming off an emotinal 
upset over previou s ly 
undefeated West mount just 
three night s earlier"; one could 
assume it was a let -down 
performance Friday night , but 
Mike Maross sees it as a 
season·long problem. "There's 
so much talent on t his team 
that players are looking over 
their shoulders saying, 'If I 
don ' t do well !>omebody's 
gonna replace me.' .. 

continued from paj,(c } ·I 
can't believe that they ha\'e 
played that kind of defense and 
lost. they played a heck of a 
ballga m e. " 

••• 
Since this is a bl·weekly 

newspaper, we can tell you 
what has happened since we 
wrote this article on aturday. 
The Clippers came back from 
beating Boston on Thursday 

only to lose Saturday night to 
the lowly Houston Rockets. 
Everything s aid above, 
disregard. The Rockets beal 
them 120-108, breaking their 
seven·game losing streak 
thanks to the Clippers ' 
miserable defense and 
lackluster offense. Forget 
whatever we said before. The 
Clippers lost to Houston. 
Forget it. 

The game was decided on
