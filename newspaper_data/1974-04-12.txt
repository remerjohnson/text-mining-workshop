McElroy 
Personal Statement 

by David Buchbinder, 
editor-in-chief 

Now that I have been summarily dismissed from 
my duties as Editor-in-Chief of the Triton Times, I feel 
that at least for the moment, I can speak as an in-
didivudal. 

The proceedings held against me and the Triton 
Times by the UCSD Communications Board were a 
procedural sham. Numerous constitutional points 
and segments of the by-laws of the Comm Board 
were either avoided or ignored. Whenever such 
points were made, the members of the Triton Times, 
myself included, were accused of attempting to 
railroad the proceedings. I feel that if anyone 
railroaded the meetings, it was the Comm Board 
itself. Secret meetings were held, and the results of 
such proceedings were made public even before I 
myself was made aware of those results. I resent this 
affront to my dignity. 

The Triton Times was found "guilty" of some of the 
charges against it solely on the basis of several letters 
to the Editor and opinion columns which certain 
people did not agree with. The actions taken by the 
Chancellor, in light of this evidence, represent a 
grievous insult to every student's right of free ex-
pression. No one, who has any sense of decency for 
the rights of other individuals to freely express 
themselves should submit to this insult to their 
freedom. 

ALLEGED NEGLIGENCE 

Scripps Clinic Sued 
For $14 Million 

M . Nancy Bradshaw of San Diego is seeking $11 
mi llion in damages in the civil conwlaint against staff 
members who treated her at Scripps Clinic and Research 
Foundation during 1972. 

Also named in the complaint is Dr. Saul H. Karlen of 
La Jolla, who, she alleges, treated her in conjunction 
with Scripp during the same period. 

The plaintiff, whose first hearing was last Thursday in 
Superior Court with Judge William A. Yale presiding, is 
uing for $1 million in general and in punitive damages 

for each of the following alleged causes of action : 
-Alleged negligence on !he part of the Scripps staff; 
- Alledged failure to treat the patient with her free 

and informed consent; 
-Alleged negligence on part of clinic . 
-Aleged interference with the employee-employer 

relat ionship (she was a marine biology teacher at San 
Diego State University); 

- Alleged conspiracy to defraud the patient of Work-
men's Compensation benefits; 

-Alleged negligence by Karlen, and 
- Alleged loss of mother's care. Co-plaintiff is the 

patient's 8-year-<>ld daughter, Clarissa. 
Ms. Bradshow also challenges the constitutionality of 

the Song Bill . 
That State act, signed into law in August, 1972, 

mandates that the plaintiff in a medic~1 malpractice suit 
must post bond of $2,500 if he or she is seeking punitive 
damages. Its formal title is Section 1029.6 (e) of the 
Code of Civil Procedure. 

Named in the suit are Drs. Stephen E. Blomgren, 
Willard P. VanderLaan, Martha M . Minteer and Richard 
A. Smith. Hydran Faulkner, a registered physical 
therapist, and Thomas Clarke, then assistant ad-
ministrator at Scripps, are also named. 

Ms. tkadshaw Is representing herself in court, 
maintaining that "trying to find a lawyer who will do 
what I tell him to takes more time than I can spend." 

Also present at the hearing last Thursday was Scripps' 
attorney Reeve J. Jacques of La Jolla, seeking a 
protective order to the interrogations enumerated in the 
120-page complaint . Yale gave him 30 days after they 
have answered the complaint. 

The next hearing will be April 26 at 9 a.m . in Superior 
Court 

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO Friday, April 12, 1974 

Dismisses TT Editor 
by John Taylor 

The Chancellor yesterday approved a UCSD Com-
munication Board recommendation to dismiss David 
Buchbinder as Editor in Chief of the Triton Times . 

Buchbinder was informed at 4:45 p.m yesterday 

April 8 Com Board Meeting 

when he received a copy of a letter from Chancellor 
McElroy to Com Board chairman Micheal Weiss, which 
contained the Chancellor'S approval of the board's 
recommendation . A recommendation to suspend the 
paper's funds for two weeks, to allowfor a reorganization 
of the Triton Times staff, was not approved by McElroy. 

The Chancellor directed the Communications Board . 
to appoint a new editor-in-chief to erve the remainder 
of the year, and, " hopefully, for the 1974-75 school 
year." The new editor would " implement" the 
reorganization of the paper . 

The action resulted from rontrover~ over the April 2 
is ue of this newspaper, which contained everal stories 
that prompted complaints of raci m and insensitivity to 
Third World tudents on campus Complaints were 
received by the board from many students OIt Third 
College, and the provost of Muir and Third Colleges . 
Revelle provost Murray Goodman had not had time to 
review the ituation, but asked the board to defer 
deCision until his review wa complet . 

Buchbinder has maintained that the atirlc articles 
contained in the April Fools issue were intended by their 
writers as attacks against the univer ity administration 

In his letter to Weis , McElroy concurred with 
statement in the board 's confi~dential recom-
r.1endations to him that "there wa no malicious Intent 
on the part of the staff of the Triton Tim s" in printing 
the April 2 stories, but that the paper "has made little 

pffective effort to make Itself representative of th{> 
University community, and has op rat d, I pre~ Ll m( O 
innocently and unlntentially, from a stan ce I".hlch hd~ 
been perceived as many as actually dl~ ourag tnl:: 
participation by those who might have broad ned It ' 
representative-ness:' McElroy also Cited a number 01 

" editorial dec isions" during thiS year's publication that 
" has reflected unusually poor ludgement .. 

The Chancellor concluded that th paper had b en 
" cumulatively 10 nsitive an9/ or In ultlng to the 
aspirations and concerns of p rson of olor on the 
campus generally ." 

The Com board had recommend d that the Triton 
Times be suspended for two w eks, to facilitate a 
restructuring of the paper toward better repre entation 
McElroy said he felt the restructurl ng (ould b p r 
formed Without such a uspenSlon, and comm nted th at 
the University hould not " be deprived of Its stngl mo t 
Important Instrument of communi cation " 

In addition , the Triton Times has I arn d from In-
formed sources that Chancellor McElroy told an 
assembly of Third College students of hiS deCISion 
yesterday afternoon before Buchbtnder received word 
According to the Chancellor'S office. the meettng at 
Third has been scheduled for a month 

The Triton Times tried to contact all three provost 
last night, but was only able to reach Third College 
provost Jo eph Watson . He commented , " I would hope 
that actions taken will help bring the campus back 
together, and help the Triton Times to erve ItS total 
responsibility to the full campus . I hope this IS a tep 

Com Board Chairman Michael Weiss 
forward ." 

The staff of the Triton Times i regretful of the 
hancellor's decision and IS meeting today to discu s 

the situation 

Food Drive Initiated for UFWA Strikers 
by Jerrv Schneider 

Local supporters of the 
United Farm Workers of 
America . began an 
emergency food dirve this 
week to help feed strikers 
on the picket lines in the 
Coachella Valley. 

The group, which draws 
members from PI. Lorna to 
North County, is one of 
about 15 or 20 
organizations in the greater 
San Diego area summoning 
aid for Caesar Chavez' 
UFWA, stated Scott Wash-
burn, San Diego area 
coordinator . 

"People on the picket 
lines in the Coachella 
Valley are not being 
covered by strike benefits . 
Thus, the farmworkers are 
in immediate need of dried 
milk, canned beans, just 
anything, for themselves 
and their families." 

Washburn stated that he 
was pleased with the 
response of support groups 
to the strike now being 
waged three weeks before 
the actual harvesting 
begins . 

The strike in the 
Coachella Valley, 80 miles 

northeast of La Jolla, 
growers signing contracts 
is the result of the growers 
signing contracts with the 
Teamsters' Union last fall. 
Meetings in Washington 
between the UFWA, the 
AFL-CIO and the Teamster 
to decide on representation 
for the farmworkers were 
still being carried on, when 
the contracts were signed . 

In addition to the foo 
drive, the San Diego 
coordinator said that the 
UFWA is still seeking help 
from the UCSD campus and 
the local community in an 
allout boycott of non-
UFWA lettuce, table grapes 
and Gallo and Franzia 
wines. 

In a joint action Monday 
in Washington, the UFWA 
ended its nationwide 
boycott of Safeway stores 
and unionized retail 
markets, but elicited AFl-
ClO support for lettuce and 
grape boycotts in return . 

In recent months, the 
10,(XX) member UFWA has 
been gaining little support, 
while at the same time 
plannina more strikes as the 
harvest moves upstate this 

spring . 
The success of the UFWA 

strike against table grape 
growers in 1965 was 
achieved, in part, by a 
widespread consumer 
boycott of table grapes. 

The policy change within 
the AFl-Cl O to support the 
lettuce and grape boycotts 
has opened the door for 
cooperative efforts between 
UFWA supporters and other 
retai I unions. 

Washburn stated that he 
plans to contact other 
unions to help with the 
boycotts, now that the AFL-
CIO has said it will back the 
UFWA boycott of the two 
farm products . He ex-
pressed hopes that union 
leaders will actively par-
ticipate in efforts to keep 
their members informed of 
the boycotts. 

Durina the 1973-74 strike 
against the Farah pants 
factories, consumers were 
urged not to purchase Farah 
product5. However, they 
were not asked to boycott 
retail tores seiling product 
other than farah pants A 
boy ott aimed at tore 
seiling scab mer handise I 

called a secondary boycott 
If it is on the merchandise 
itself it is primary. 

According to Thyra 
Decker , coordinator of 
!-ood Services, her 
department made a 
" gentlemen's agreement" 
almost two year ago with 
MECHA 'to only purchase 
from di tributors whose 
lettuce was marked with the 
Aztec Eagle, the label of the 
UFWA. 

Decker also tated that 
Food Services has not 
bought table grapes for 
several year 

Canned and dry goods for 
the food drive can be 
brought to the Re ident 
Dean's Office at Revelle

Nexus to be Nixed 
On April 1, the UCSB Daily Nexus Board decided to 

endorse candidates for A .S. elections. An A.S. bylaw 
prohibited them from endorsing political movements, 
candidates, or ballot propositions. 

The A .S. may decide to freeze funds for the Daily 
Nexus. The Daily Nexus feels, however, that this is an 
issue of the freedom of the press . 

If the A.S. council voted to freeze the Nexus funds 
production would stop allnost immediately and n~ 
more issues could be printed until the issue was 
resolved by the judicial Board of the A.S. 

However, it is possible that the Chancellor could step 
in and fund the newspaper. The Chancellor's office has 
not made any decision at this time. 

Professional Certification 
Professional Certificate Programs has added a new 

dimension at University of California Extension, San 
Diego. 

The certificate programs, for people who want to 
further their professional and personal interests require 
participants to complete 9 courses which th~y select 
from a group of 25-50 developed by Extension and 
usually a cosponsoring organization. 

The new dimension is the Human Services Certificate 
program, offered in cooperation with the San Diego city 
and county Human Resources agencies and the San 
Diego County Department of Public Welfare. It has 
been designed to equip those who work with people 
(such as teachers, social workers, ministers and 
volunteers) with abilities to provide the right kind of 
service, when and where it is needed . 

University Extension also offers professional cer-
tificate programs in three areas of computer 
technology, credit union operation and management, 
management, and real estate. 

Several courses for spring quarter pertaining to all of 
the certificates mentioned above will beg;" April 1st. 

. Additional information may be obtained by ca ll ing the 
ProfeSSional Programs office at 453-2000, extension

High G.I. Bill Use 
Veterans Administration officials say more than half 

of all Vietnam-Era veterans, el igible service men and 
women have used the current C .I. Bill. Current par-
t icipation is 50.9 percent, which surpasses the 50.4 
percent rate recorded by World War II veterans. 

The officials further noted that Vietnam-Era trainees 
exceeded the rate recorded during 12 years of the 
original C I . Bill in less than eight yedrs. 

It i.s expected that the impending May 31, 1974, 
deadline for veterans discharged before june 1, 1966, to 
use their educati<JO benefits should increase enrol lment 
to approximately 21.45 million during fiscal year 1974, 
compared to 2.1 million during fiscal year 1973. 

Other contribLting factors, say officials, include VA's 
Intensified "outr,!ach" efforts encouraging veterans to 
enter training, ncreased education allowances and 
other improvem\m~ in the G I Rill program. 

By the end )f january, 4.6 million post-KurLJ.n 
veterans servic.e men and women (separated since 
january 31, 195~ ) , had trained under the current C.1. 
Bill. As for colle36, more have already trained at that 
level than World War II veterans during the entire life of 
the original C .1. Bill 

Of 1.4 million trainees in january, 829,000 attended 
college, increasing that category to 2.3 million si nce the 
current C .I. Bill was enacted in june 1966. By com-
parison, 2.2 million World War II veterans used their 
benefits for college study, 

In addition to those who studied 10 college in 
january, another 450,000 veterans trained at other 
5 hools, and 126,000 took on-lob training . 

P;!IICe 2 Triton Times, April 12, 1974 

Extension Offers Women's 
Management Courses 

UCSD Extension is getting into the area of 
management courses for women and Dr. Mary lin-
denstein Walshok, a program director of the Extension 
staff, recently discussed reasons why. . 

"The few women who are already in management 
positions are often excluded from informal learning 
occurring by ways of various communications and 
'collegial' networks in an organization," she pointed 
out, " so there is a need for special programs to educate 
them about processes going on in business and skills 
they Aeed in order to participate." 

Another problem seen by the young sociologist is that 
many management courses now offered do not draw 
women participants, due to prejudi~t!s held by em-
ployers, under-<onfidence on the part of women or 
simply a failure to recruit women . ' 

Extension is making an effort, through business and 
the public media, to bring women aspiring to higher 
positiofls to the special programs it will offer for them 
this sprin.g. 

Learning to communicate non-defensively, said Dr. 
Walshok, is an aid to assertiveness. "Further," she 
points out, "women need to become assured that being 
ambitious and assertive is not being 'unfeminine: " 

A weekend conference April 19 and 20 titled 
'Women in Management," will explore collaborative 
and competitive styles of management. Dr. Melinda 
Sprague, an associate professor of business ad-
ministration at San Diego State University; and Alice 
Sargent, a social psychologist and educator who has 
ta.ken the Training for Trainers course at Yale University, 
Will lead thiS two-day session . . 

Ms . Sargent and Dr. Walshok are among the speakers 
who will conduct "How to Stop Discrimination Against 
Yourself' weekly on Tuesday evenings beginning 
Tuesday through june. 

Information about program fees, exact times and 
locations, and enrollment will be furnished ' by

firmation of the hypocrisy 
that the TT's staff attacked , Amazing So What? James E. Shipman, Jr . 

Editor: 
The response to the April 

Fool's issue of the Triton 
Times was really quite 
amazing. It's good to see all 
you right-minded defenders 
of truth and freedom still 
defending truth and 
feedom, if not humor. 
There was a time, of course, 
when campus humor was 
alive and well. That was 
before students became 
incredibly immature . They 
used to laugh. Too bad 
we've come so far. 

I n the world full of shit 
your best weapon is a 
healthy sense of humor. To 
you who see nothing funny 
I say : you're full of shit . 

Sincerely, 
Lee H. Kronenberg 

Complex 
Editor, 
Aw come on Nick ! You've 

got your i ntellectua I head 
up your ass. And so do you 
Ron and Dave , And to the 
guy next to him who share 
the same views, For some 
reason , you all have a deep 
rooted paranoia and 
humorless guilt complex 
and just can't take a good 
joke, 

To take the April 1 issue 
seriously is the best proof I 
have for that . It was one of 
the best issues of the times 
ever printed and the first I 
have ever enjoyed reading 
all of , I would like to see 
more of the thought and 
creativeness that the issue 
presented but seriously 
attack pompous, pious, 
selfish, humorless , 
bureaucratic, and sen-
selessly intellectual 
students, staH, faculty, and 
administrators, (such as 
those connected with 3rd 
college, the , cafeteria, and

Provost's offices , COM-

To the Editor of the 
Triton Times ' 

Regarding the uproar 
over the April Fool's issue of 
the TT, all I can say is "So 
whaH", So what if we all 
agree that it was "tasteless 
shit"? So what if we all 
agree it was a poor attempt 
at satire? So what if 
everyone gets in a frenzy 
over this issue? Does it 
change anything? 

Third College won't get 
built any sooner; Third 
College students will 
continue to be "benignly 
neglected"; and the 
university will continue to 
maintain imbecile quotas to 
show everyone that they are 
riot discriminating against 
minorities , These con-
ditions were ripe for satiric 
attacks. One need only take 
note of the subsequent 
furor to realize that 
SOMETHING struck home 
to SOMEBODY, 

It is unfortunate that 
several Third College 
students see the satire as a 
personal attack on 
minorities, or as promoting 
racism , Such a view is to 
miss the point entirely, I see 
theTT's attack as directed 
against institutions and the 
bureaucratic mind, not as a 
personal affront to a 
member of a minority, My 
point is that the satire in the 
April Fool 's edition was 
valid ; whether it was 
"tasteful " or not I leave to 
other judges, 

Now, what is to be gained 
by firing Dave Buchbinder 
and the others responsible 
for perpetrating " this trash" 
on us? Since when do we 
fire someone for making a 
mistake? (I leave the 
question open whether or 
not a mistake was made), 
We don't gain a damn thing 
by dismissing Dave Buch-
binder & Co" but we do lose 
freedom of the press , 
freedom of speech, and an 
editor who isn't afraid to 
take on hypocrisy almost 
single-handed , 

Firing people for telling 
the truth is a solid con-

4 Triton Times, April 12, 1'174 

Afraid 
Editor, 
As with any large social 

unit, this school has lots of 
problems, It seems to me a 
sad fact that our newspaper 
isoneofthe biggest ones , If 
making a person angry, 
bitter, and sick to his 
stomach could possibly 
lead that person to a better 
understanding and a 
willingness to try to solve 
our social problems, then 
the Triton Times should be 
commended , If there is 
some better way to inform, 
educate, and perhaps 
motivate, then the Triton 
Times should get on the 
ball. 

The printed word is a 
powerful thing and any 
newspaper should 
recognize its potential to 
build or to destroy . The 
journalism presently being 
inflicted on this school 
shows an unfortunate lack 
of responsibility, Poor taste 
and misjudgements we can 
learn to live with , but 
seeming continuous at-
tempts to undermine a 
whole segment of the 
University cannot be 
ignored, 

I'm embarrassed to have 
to admit that the Triton 
Times is our official 
publication , With the April 
Fool edition I reached the 
point at which I'm actually 
afraid each Tuesday and 
Friday to look and see what 
sort of inflammatory 
material we're circulating 
now , We've all heard 
people say, " No news is 
good news", Let's hope we 
never hear, " no newspaper 
is good news," 

Rusty Knight 
(755-3623) 

Heady 
Editor : 
'Perhaps the most ironic 

aspect of your recent April 
Fool 's edition is that it 
created more controversy 

But it is disappointing 
when people whose views 
you are champion ina 
suddenly accuse you of 
attacking them, Sadly, there 
are some people who are so 
sensitive and wrapped up in 
their own suspicions and 
hostil ity that it aHects their 
perception : they recognize 
the barbs of satire but can't 
tell which way the barbs are 
pointing, And when in 
doubt, act paranoid , 

To claim that your satire 
promoted racial tension is 
absurd , Just as reporting 
crime news does not imply 
you are advocating 
lawlessness, so writing 
about ridiculous ideas and 
using gross caricatures to 
demonstrate a point of view 
do not mean you approve 
of what they stand for, 

You could have 
published nice, con-
ventional articles 
bemoaning racism , sexism, 
educational policy, Dutch 
elm blight, etc. etc . etc " 
and nothing would have 
happened and everyone 
would still be happy. But 
you tried to say things 
differently, and got blasted , 

Well, maybe you can try 
again, in another four years ,

Importance 
Dear Sirs ; 

The Triton Times is of 
extreme importance to all 
the members of the 
U,e.S ,D, community in that 
it is an official Student 
newspaper funded for the 
most part by student fees 
and it is here to represent 
an unbiased total student 
opinion ' in its articles and 
common sense and taste in 
its editorials, 

The Triton Times, since I 
have been at this school, 
has done a decent job on 
the former and a disgraceful 
job on the latter; the letter 
to 'a Black Woman' and an

article of opinion on 
masturbation, Articles of 
this nature have no place in 
this newspaper, 

In the April first edition, 
the culmination of the 
papers mistakes which 
incurred the ad-
ministration's displeasure, 
the two errors are obvious, 
First the placement of the 
offending articles of the 
first page, and second, the 
use of a certain professor's 
name, This was opinion and 
has no riaht to the first 
page, and because of its 
position it was obviously 
mistaken by some to be 
true, 

Next, I move to the 
totality of the articles 
themselves. The message 
these articles were trying to 
voice, if nobody got it, are 
about the extremely ob-
vious deviations in the 
campus hiring policy in 
regard to affirmative action 
from the legal norm; social 
bias by not only the 
students , but also the 
administration against 
Third College; the quality of 
food on this campus has 
long been a major irritant to 
those who must eat it along 
with the cafeteria 
management's neglect and 
in some cases refusal to 
cook in a manner that does 
justice to the quality of 
food they bought, 

It appears to me that this 
administration wishes to 
portray this school as one 
for white male pre-meds 
who live at i{evelle, And I 
am not so sure that the 
administration wishes the 
removal of the editors of 
the T,T, merely because of 
the placement of the 
'sarcasm and irony', but

We Are You 
by 

Marco li Mandri 

Yes , This is us, the 
representitives of you, We 
exist reaardless of whether 
or not you accept our silent 
presence, It is easy to deny 
our existance, for then your 
"self-al ienation" socio-
logical syndrome will be 
complete, Let me Simply 
end the fallacy : UCSD 
student government does 
exist , We are too small to be 
a small bureaucracy, so you 
may Simply call us a group 
of students , This aroup is 
voluntary, and most im-
portantly to obliderate your 
cynical views towards 
student government , we are 
all non-paid , Any paying 
jobs your student govern-
ment representitives, or we, 
now have have been at-
tained through an equal 
opportunity employment 
hiring procedure , We are 
legitimate, 

We have meetings every 
two weeks for you, but you 
never appear , Why is this 
redundant situation oc-
curing? We are oHicially

Saturday night April 1'3, the U,C.S,D, Campus 

Program l30ard will present two films by director 
Federico Fellini , "Satyricon" and "Guilletta Degli 
Spiriti" (Juliet of the Spirits). 

"Salyricon " is a dream documentary of the early 
Romans. Fellini has created hi s own altered version of 
the Petronious myth with hermaphrodites, hairy dwarfs, 
and the strange characters of Nero's court , !-ellini says " I 
tried to propo'se to the audience a new vision of men 
before Christ ; men free from guilt, from the ethica l and 
moral istic view that Christianity has given us, 

In " Juliet of the Spirits", Fellini explores the search for 
self, as youth dwindles toward middle age, in a way that 
would bring "6'1," to mind . Guido's counter part is 
Guilietta, who's crumbling marriage launches her Into 
the sub-conscious in the spiritual avenues of liberation , 
The "mise en scene" is dazzling and vivid as Fellini 
abandons sublety in this , his first color production,

Finally after months ot FORWARD! 
"intensive" training and 
cancelled matches, the 
awesome Women's Rugby 
Team proved why they 
should be feared, as they 
outplayt'd the Elanors of 
Pasadena 32~. The Elanors 
were short a few ruggers 
(some say they were lost on 
the long journey here) so 
some UC players filled out 
their side, 

The Elanors were huge 
compared to the Triton 
Thrust (UCSD women 
believe they have a lot of 
it), but proved to be 

, dramatically slower. The 
overall play of both sides 
was of a caliber seldom 
found outside of i n-
ternational matches , 
Picture-perfect passing and 
dazzling running streamed 
through the Sunday af-
ternoon event. The tone of 
the game was set in the first 
few minutes. From a loose 
ruck, the ball cleanly came 
out through the nimble-
fingered backs to right-
w inger Charlotte, who 
scooted around the op-
position's flank for an easy 
score . Laurie Cage at -
tempted to add more 
points, but appeared to 
have been auditioning for 
the age-ol d brown-foot 
award , 

The Elanors came back 
with one of their many set 
plays, hoping to confuse 
the Tritons, not realizing 
the thorough coachi ng that 
Pete $ertic had given them 
As soon as the move was 
enacted, Shawn Cluska 
rambled down the sidelines 
and ended her act in a 
cloud of lime . From the 
ensui ng lineout, hard-
running Val streaked 
through the Elanors defense 
for her first try . 

Still, UC had more stars 
to blmsom. For the first 
time in rugby history, a 
prop had so much " thrust" 
that she went clear through 
the opponent's scrum. She 
was only seconds behind 
the ball to the amazement 
of the soon-to-be-nailed 
scrum-half. Amelia 
"Csonka" was fu ll of other 
tricks too, crawling in and 
out of mauls h. retrieve the 
ball, much I ke a mole 
would . Yet ':s:onka was 
remembered primarily for 
her head dow I , bulldozing 
running. Many a rugger was 
left in her wa ,(e, since the 
only gear she ~ ,o.sessed was 

Yet the Elanors, far from 
being beaten, pressed the 
Triton Thrust, penetrating 
deeply and causing undo 
chaos, but Jeanne "Orr" 

stabilized matters by 
scooping up the loose ball 
and showing good legwork 
to set Char up for another 
score, The half ended with a 
brilliant exhibition of 
dribbling, ending in a try for 
Debby Do-Right after Val 
was hogtied by two op-
ponents . 

Throughout the match, 
the Elanors dom inated 
lineouts and set play but 
none ' could match the 
Thrust in loose ball play. 
With a comfortable lead, 
UC began to experiment 
with new plays, yet the 
Elanors defense seemed 
stronger than before 
(lwonder why!) , Yet Denise 
" the determined ", 
challenged her worthy 
opponents, and it took 
more than a few to slow her 
down , Mary Morris, who 
until now had been un-
noticed, changed that when 
she broke through and 
scooted 60 yards for an easy 
try , Others also portrayed 
great long distance running 
as Val added another try 
and Shawn Clutsy bulled 
her way 50 yards for a score. 

The match finally ended 
as it began, with a score, 
when Mary took one Elanor 
for a ride, dragging her five 
yards for a score. The final 
score showed nothing of 
the marvelous play of both 
teams and the new friends 
that were made . The 
crowning glory of the day 
was the good time had by 
all. This match and these 
women mard the beginning 
of a new l ife in rugby, and 
its aura wi ll be carried on 
this weekend, when these 
two teams meet again in 
front of 56 hardened men's 
sides at the Santa Barbara 
Rugby Tournament.

Wiederholt Stops Azusa 11M News I 
After the Triton Baseball 

squad had defeated Azusa 
Pacific, 7-5 last Tuesday, 

player~oach Charlie Garcia 
issued a warning to up-
coming opponents. After a 
terrible start this season 
"the team has jelled and 
opponents had better watch 
out," according to Charlie, 
An improvement in team 
attitude has contributed to 
the turn around of the 
teams season as they have 
won three of their last four 
games. 

I n the game against 
league leading Azusa 
Pacific it was the fine 
pitching of Jeff Weiderho!t 
that stood out for the 
Tritons, Azusa scored four 
runs in the first two innings, 
all due to defensive lapses 

on the part of the UCSD 
Infield , 

In the third inning the 
Tritons cut the deficit to 
one run on the strength of 
Curt Jenkins inside-the-park 
home run , With two outs 
Fred cribi and Dave Lettuca 
worked the AP pitcher for 
walks, then Jenkins drilled a 
line shot to center that 
skipped past the cen-
terfielder and rolled to the 
fence, Jenkins, with his 
speed, scored easily. 

UCSD scored in the sixth 
to tie the game. Once again 
a two out rally was the 
order of the day as Bill 
Goddard singled , then 
scored on Charlie Garcia's 
booming double down the 
left field line.

Tartuffe 
continued from Pille 5 

play in the lines of Tartuffe: 
"And there's no evil until 
the act is known;/ It's 
scandal , Madam, which 
makes it an offense./And 
it's no sin to sin in con-
fi dence," the gist of which 
could alnwst ttave been 
taken from Haldeman's 
Watergate statements , 

"The play is very funny 
and is often played as a 
rather hectic farce," 
Christmas said. "But, I 
be lieve you should examine 
these people in relation to 
each other. They are very, 
very human and placed in 
some very funny situations. 
I prefer to present 'T artuffe' 
as a comedy of character 
rather than a farce ," 

Christmas has set the play 
in the 1870's rather than 
in Moliere's time . 

Importance 
continued from page 4 
because of it, that the 
campus does not fit into the 
stereotype . That this 
campus cannot and will not 
accept this well deserved 
jibe against itself shows that 
the 'sarcasm and irony' is all 
too well deserved. How can 
the Mui r Prowst say that 
the editors are 'out of 
touch ' when they have 
pointed to the main 
problems facing this 
campus? And of course it 
can not be 'dismis:.ed as a 
prank' because it is all too 
true . This campus has the 
lowest fulfilment of the 
affirmative action 
guidelines set by the federal 
government . Urban and 
Rural Studies and Third 
World Studies was in-
troduced as a conciliatory 
measure to the Free Speech 

movement of the Sixties 
and the programs set up as 
a spite campaign , This is 
still carried on by the 
administration in its slur 
campaign against Third 
College, 

As all people who like to 
keep skeletons in their 
closets hidden, the ad-
ministration would rather 
fire the editors than face 
the music wh ich they have 
caused to be wr itten. 

It is also interesting that 
the Chancellor was asked to 
make the final decision and 
that the Provosts asked for a 
special review when this is a 
Student paper as it states in 
the box on page three, I'd 
li ke to see a student vote, 
To me all this boils down to 
freedom of the Press with 
regard to the silenci ng of 
the Triton Times. 

Mark Si ndler 
U78941198 C-hristmas, who has played the title role before, 

directed the play in Rich-
mond, Virginia , several 
years ago. 

" By doing so we over-
come some of the special 
problems presented by the 
clothes and fancy wigs 
worn in that earlier time," 
Christmas said. "Also, till 
the end of the last century, 
the father was considered 
the head of the' household," 
he said. If we moved it to 
the present age, no one' 
would believe it." That 
which no one would believe 
can be seen in the 
relationship between Orgon 
and his daughter, Mariane, 
Orgon, completely taken in 
by Tartuffe, wants Tartuffe 
and Mariane to marry . 
Marione is already in love 
with someone els~but she 
is a good daughter and will 
do anything he says 
because she would never 
want to hurt h im by going 
against any of his wishes . 
Mariane's ma id sar -
castically sums up the 
dominant role of the father 
in the family : " Ah no, a 
dutiful daughter must 
obey/ her father even if he 
weds her to an ape."

continued from page 5 

lectures 

"Here we will be starting 
where I left off in Rich-
mond," Christmas said , 
"There were many things in 
that production that I felt 
were n't right and th is 
production gives me a 
ch ance to improve on 
them." 

Christmas is using three 
other drama department 
faculty members and one 
UCSD staff member in the 
ca st as well as himself . The 
remaining seven roles are 
played by UCSD students. 

Tickets for "Tartuffe" are 
available through the UCSD 
Drama Department or at

are warned to get tickets 
immediately as the show is 
certain to sell-out. 

On Wednesday, April 24, the La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art will present a lecture entitled " Robert 
Mangold : The Geometry of the Sixties ," The lecture, 
presented by museum curator, Jay Belloli relates to the

cont inuing to pick and 
choose among an assort-
ment of men and women 
(as he did during his 
marriage) . 

The plot is the least 
important e lement in 
"Father's Day ," Father 's Day 
happens to be a visitation 
day allowed the fathers and 
provides an excuse for a 
party in which the husbands 
and ' wives may confront 
o ne another . Contrived , 
yes, but not so intrusive as 
one might expect. 

Barbara Rush is an ex-
ce llent Marian. She delivers 
her l ines with a politesse 
that is as lethal as Carol 
Cook 's acidity . Gwynne 
Gilford is properly mystified 
by her situati on and is good 
in her expression of the 
maybe;-if-I-c lose-my-eyes al-
titude I towards her 
d ivorce. Top billing should 
have been given to Carol 
Cook. She is able to make 
the audience laugh without 
saying a word . She has the 
best l ines, and she plays her 
part of a bitchy ex-actress to 
the hilt.
