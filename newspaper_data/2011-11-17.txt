UCSD Parking and Transportation — 
faced with a $5-million deficit — is con-
sidering consolidating various campus 
shuttle routes, including Hillcrest, Torrey 
Pines and Campus Loop. 

The proposal to combine the Hillcrest/
Campus and Hillcrest/Old Town shuttles 
has drawn concern among students and 
community residents. The suggestion 
— which is expected to save $150,000 
annually — is among 15 to 20 different 
solutions UCSD Transportation Services 
is considering in order to work within its 
budget constraints. 

“Transportation Services currently has 
a four million to five million annual oper-
ating deficit that must be reduced,” Acting 
Director of Transportation Services Brian 
DeMeulle said in an email. 

According to DeMeulle, funding both 
the Hillcrest/Campus and Hillcrest/Old 
Town routes amounts to $850,000 annu-
ally.

Approximately 10 members of the 
public met with UCSD Transportation 
Services to discuss a proposal to con-
solidate the two shuttles in an open forum 
held Nov. 13.

After initially siding with police, UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert J. Birgeneau has condemned the police 
brutality toward students that took place at 
an “Occupy Cal” protest last Wednesday, 

Nov. 9. Campus police in riot gear used 
batons to violently beat several protest-
ers who had supposedly broken the univer-
sity’s rule on “no encampments,” he said. 
    UC Berkeley sophomore Zoe Weiss said she 
felt that students were unfairly treated by the 
administration and campus police.

“While it is true that setting up tents 
on the Berkeley campus is illegal, beating 
unarmed, non-violent college students with 
batons because they refused to move from 
their encampment is horrible and inexcusable,” 
Weiss said.

Birgeneau initially sent an all-campus email 
on Nov. 10 stating that he supported Berkeley 
police in their efforts to control civil disobedi-
ence.

“It is unfortunate that some protesters chose 
to obstruct the police by linking arms and 
forming a human chain to prevent the police 
from gaining access to the tents,” Birgeneau 
said in the statement. “This is not non-violent 
civil disobedience.”

Birgeneau retracted this statement on Nov. 
14 in a second all-campus email in which the

Student leaders have condemned the UC Board of Regents’ deci-
sion to cancel its meeting scheduled for Nov. 16-17 on the UC San 
Francisco campus.

The Board of Regents announced in a Nov. 14 press release that 
the meeting was cancelled due to credible threats that there were 
plans for violent confrontations at demonstrations outside the meet-
ing. Law enforcement at the Mission Bay campus of UCSF warned 
the Regents about the threats and recommended that the meeting 
not take place this week.

“From various sources they had received information indicat-
ing that rogue elements intent on violence and confrontation with

CLOSED QUARTERS By Kat Truong

KawasakiÊDiseaseÊLinkedÊtoÊWindÊCurrents
SCIENCEÊANDÊTECHNOLOGY

BY MICHAEL CHANG
Staff Writer

Scientists have found that wind 
currents may worsen Kawasaki dis-
ease, a condition that causes inflamed 
blood vessels. If further research con-
firms this, Kawasaki disease would be 
the first documented illness in which 
long-range wind transportation plays 
a significant role in creating infections, 
giving researchers a breakthrough on 
a 40-year-old medical mystery that has 
confounded even genetic studies.

Kawasaki disease is an autoim-
mune illness that commonly affects 
children from infancy to five years 
old. Blood vessels in the body become 
inflamed and cause a persistent fever 
along with rashes, red eyes, lips and 
tongue, swollen hands and feet with 
peeling skin. The disease may cause 
damage to the coronary arteries 
and if left untreated, it will result 
in serious, sometimes fatal, heart 
problems during early adulthood.    
   The study was led by Chief and 
Professor of Pediatrics Jane Burns, who 

is also a specialist in Kawasaki disease. 
A decade ago, Burns first started to 

examine the idea of wind currents trig-
gering the disease with researcher Dan 
Cayan, who is a part of the Climate 
Atmosphere Science and Physical 
Oceanography Division of  the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography. 

“There have been all sorts of theo-
ries, from cleaning your carpets that 
might release some kind of germ into 
the air, to human-to-human transmis-
sion, to so on and so forth,” Cayan 
said. “One of the clues that led us to 
believe there was an environmental 
trigger was that it’s quite seasonal.”

Research has shown that the dis-
ease is most active from November 
until March. In addition, during April 
1979, May 1982 and March 1986 
— the three times when the disease 
reached its highest peaks in Japan — 
there was a significant northwestern 
wind from central Asia blowing across 
the country. 

A low amount of cases were 
reported when currents came from the 
south. The strength of the wind also 

affects the amount of cases. Winds 
from the northwest are strongest dur-
ing the winter. During the other sea-
sons, the current is often weaker or in 
another direction.

Currently, the scientists are investi-
gating two hypotheses regarding why 
the relationship between Kawasaki 
disease and northwestern winds exists. 
One is that the wind carries an infec-
tious agent. The other is that pollut-
ants in the wind may play a significant 
role in causing swells of the illness.

“There may be some aircraft sam-
pling and true biological germ hunting 
that will try to determine whether 
there are germs that are residing on 
these air currents that occur high 
above the earth’s surface that could 
be transported,” Cayan said. “There 
will be more focused work to try 
and understand whether the biology, 
if it is found, has some kind of bio-
logical connection to what they find 
in Kawasaki patients.”

Your books are overdue... 
And so is your DEATH.

tritontv.com/3rdfloor/

Armed with A.S. spirit and a 
banquet of chips, cookies, candy 
and soda, A.S. Council was 
prepared to lure in constituents to 
this week’s public meeting in Price 
Center Ballroom East.

At first, the turnout seemed 
p r o m i s i n g , 
especially since 
the results for 
a l l - c o u n c i l 
outreach week’s 
college council 
competition from 
last week were 
announced, with 
ERC in first place.

But it turns out that some 
members of the public weren’t 
involved with college councils.

“My father told me to never say 
no to free food or free beer,” Muir 
College transfer  student Hiten 
Shah said. That definitely explains 
it then.

Other attendees included 
people like Revelle College senior 
Nolan Weber, who came with a 
purpose. Weber felt that the music 
selection at the most recent Bear 
Garden was unacceptable.

“For God’s sake, we’re a 
university,” he said. “’Fill me with 
your poison, I want to be a victim, 
ready for abduction.’ What is this, 
‘have sex with me and you own 
me?’”

Associate Vice President of 
Academic Affairs Mac Zilber 
reported that the Zanzibar Café 
has approved the “Loft with a Prof ” 
program. This will basically be 
a more casual Dine with a Prof  
— a program through council 
that allows students to take their 
professors to lunch at the Faculty 
club for free — at Zanzibar Café.

President Alyssa Wing 

presented a much-anticipated 
update on the progress of moving 
UCSD into Division I athletics.

“Since we are already at the top 
of D-II, it’s a natural progression in 
our pursuit of excellence to move to 
D-I,” she said.

T h e 
referendum, 
which will 
be presented 
to council 
for a vote 
on Nov. 30, 
will include 
a $165-per-

quarter fee increase to students. 
This will help fund the scholarships, 
coaches and support staff, 
among other things, necessary to 
remaining competitive in the Big 
West Division I conference.

Many councilmembers were 
excited at the prospect of moving 
to Division 1.

“Think of athletics as an 
investment,” Engineering Senator 
Parminder Sandhu said. “It took a 
lot of courage to move from D-III 
to D-II, and now we need to be 
brave an make the jump to D-I.”

Not everyone was supportive of 
the referendum, however.

“I personally work three part-
time jobs to afford college, and 
there are tons of people dropping 
out because they can’t afford it,” 
Associate Vice President of Student 
Organizations Lynne Swerhone 
said. “Let’s take a couple of seconds 
here and just think about what 
we’re doing.”

Remember, council, passing 
the referendum only opens it to 
student vote. If you shut it down, 
your constituents will not have the 
opportunity to make their own 
decision.

chancellor said he was out of the 
country at the time and had not seen 
footage of the police brutality when 
he sent the initial email. 

“It was only yesterday that I was 
able to look at a number of the vid-
eos that were made of the protests on 
Nov. 9,” Birgeneau wrote in the Nov. 
14 email. “These videos are very 
disturbing.”

In the second email, Birgeneau 
stated that the former UC Berkeley 
Dean of Law Jesse Choper will 
immediately review and assess the 
incident.

Weiss said that Birgeneau has 
since granted amnesty to those 
arrested. 

“We believe that we can best 
move forward by granting amnes-
ty from action under the Student 
Code of Conduct to all Berkeley 
students who were arrested and cited 

solely for attempting to block the 
police in removing the Occupy Cal 
encampment on Wednesday, Nov.  
9,” Birgeneau wrote. “We will do so 
immediately.”

Weiss emphasized that protest 
tactics have visibly changed since 
the Nov. 9 incident.

“A lot of protesters have shifted 
their attention from their original 
goals to that of the police violence,” 
Weiss said. “Obviously, these acts 
need to be addressed and dealt with, 
but I think that it’s also important 
to keep in mind that, as students 
of the UC system, budget cuts and 
tuition increases directly affect us, 
and that message needs to remain 
strong within the protest.”

UCSD Vice President of External 
Affairs Samer Naji said that he 
believes that the administration and 
UC Board of Regents need to be held 
accountable for last Wednesday’s 

incident.
“It’s absolutely unacceptable,” 

Naji said. “There is no excuse to 
justify what police did to peaceful 
students.”

Naji added that he believes this 
will spur additional activism at all 
UC campuses. 

“Any time police attack protest-
ers, it galvanizes the movement,” 
Naji said. “I know we surprised the 
administration this year with the 
amount of activism that’s present at 
UCSD. I don’t see the activism going 
away anytime soon. It’s only going 
to increase. It’s only getting stronger.

Naji proposed a resolution to A.S. 
Council condemning the police bru-
tality at UC Berkeley. The resolution 
passed on at council’s meeting last 
Wednesday, Nov. 11.

CombiningÊRoutesÊWouldÊSaveÊUCSDÊ$150KÊAnnually

 Transportation Services Assistant Director 
Todd Berven, Supervisor of Shuttle Operations 
Don Riddle and Training Manager Chuck 
Quisenberry administered the Monday morning 
meeting, held at Thornton Hospital. Members of 
the public in attendance included two graduate 
students, four staff members and five students.

According to Berven, the Old Town shuttle 
costs about $150,000 annually to run, which 
averages $8.44 a ride per person. Comparatively, 
the Hillcrest shuttle costs an average of $3.67 per 
trip. Consolidating the two routes would lower 
the cost to $3.27 per passenger trip, DeMeulle 
said.

In order to compensate for the increased 
amount of passengers, DeMeulle said that the 
Hillcrest/Old Town routes will have 60-pas-
senger buses. The Old Town shuttles, which 
currently seat 22 passengers, will be reassigned 
to other routes.  Berven said that two-thirds of 
Hillcrest shuttles during 6:30 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. 
would still go directly to campus. 

UCSD Parking and Transportation funds 
the Old Town shuttle through parking citation 
revenue. The medical center provides half of 
the funding for the Hillcrest shuttle; the rest is 
provided by parking citation revenue. 

According to Berven, the UC Office of the 
President requires Transportation Services to 
use parking citation revenue to fund the shuttle 
services provided by the university, but funds 
from parking and transportation currently pro-
vide enough to fund only one-third of these 
programs. Therefore, service changes may take 
effect as early as April. 

 “We are also considering consolidating cam-
pus loop and getting rid of Torrey Pines [shut-
tle],” Berven said.

The Transportation Policy Committee 
— which is comprised of Vice Chancellor 
of Resource Management Gary Matthews, 

DeMeulle and approximately five undergradu-
ate and graduate students — plans to discuss the 
Hillcrest shuttle consolidation proposal at its 
January meeting, Berven said. Once the proposal 
goes through the committee for a vote, it will be 
submitted to Matthews for final approval before 
its implementation, which is set for April 2, 2012. 
    At the meeting, graduate student and 
Hillcrest resident Britt Flaherty suggested 
providing free bus sticker passes for hospi-
tal patients in order to maintain the shut-
tle’s current route. Flaherty said that people 
using the Old Town shuttle can use the MTS 
10 bus route, which provides a similar route. 
           Although this idea was previously considered, 
it poses potential conflicts, Quisenberry said. 
      “Once it changes, it becomes a public tran-
sit organization and anyone can ride it,” 
Quisenberry said. “I know many staff, includ-
ing myself, prefer to ride UCSD buses.” 
 The proposed route would add about five to 10 
minutes to the campus commute, Berven said. 
           “Our goal is to not inconvenience people com-
ing from Hillcrest,” Riddle said. “We want to uti-
lize our assets in the most efficient way possible.” 
    Flaherty brought up the idea of stu-
dents funding these services directly. 
    “UCSD is a leader of green transporta-
tion,” Flaherty said. “If the shuttle ser-
vices are being cut, shows that this may 
not be sustainable. We have to be creative 
— I’m willing to pay for these services.” 
           Transportation Services wants to work with 
the community on a solution, but alternatives 
are limited by the cost of fuel, Quisenberry said. 
   “A full bus is a good bus,” Quisenberry said. “If 
it’s not [full], it’s a wasted trip.”

According to DeMeulle, Transportation 
Services will hold more forums in early January.

UC public safety officers were plan-
ning to attach themselves to peaceful 
demonstrations expected to occur at 
the meeting,” the Regents wrote in the 
press release.

UC student leaders were angry 
at the decision to cancel the meeting 
because they had planned to use it as 
an opportunity to voice opposition to 
proposed fee hikes and advocate for 
an end to systemwide cuts.

“We do understand the concerns 
about public safety, yet the Regents 
also have a responsibility to the stu-
dents and people of California to 
hold open meetings that allow for 
public access and participation,” 
UC Student Association President 
Claudia Magana said in a Nov. 14 
UCSA statement.

UC Student Regent Alfredo 
Mireles Jr. stated that he too under-

stood the rea-
sons for the 
meeting’s can-
cellation, but 
said that stu-
dents should 
still exercise 
n o n - v i o l e n t 
assembly.

“We would 
support finding 
a way for stu-
dent attendees 
to exercise their 
constitutional 
and moral right 
to protest while 
excluding non-
student ele-

ments that raise the specter of vio-
lence and vandalism,” he wrote. 

The Regents had planned to dis-
cuss systemwide financial plans and 

was expected to weigh in on a pro-
posed annual tuition hike of 16 per-
cent for the next four years. 

According to a Los Angeles Times 
article, UC President Mark G. Yudof 
announced on Nov. 8 that he planned 
to scrap the tuition increase plan. 
Instead, he hopes to receive increased 
funding from the state government in 
order to increase UC enrollment by 
1 percent.

UC Office of the President spokes-
person Leslie Sepuka declined to 
comment on the specific reasons for 
the meeting’s cancellation. She said 
that the meeting will be rescheduled,  
though the new date is unsure. 

“Just because the meeting isn’t 
happening doesn’t mean the work 
here is stopping,” Sepuka said.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 17,  2011 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

The height of nuevo-preten-tiousness may very well be the rise of the food truck. 
Internet-savvy foodies can literally 
out-obscure each other by sneering 
at each other’s favorite truck, with 

the winner of course being the per-
son who ate at the scary “authentic” 
ethnic one. But screw the haters — I 
have them beat. Because the only 
thing better than taking a lunch 
break at a hard-to-find food truck is 
getting a Food Network-sponsored 
free sandwich at the said truck.

Food trucks are already well 
integrated into our cultural lexicon, 
but they also have an awesome ten-
dency of promoting free giveaways 
on Twitter in an attempt to expand 
their fanbase. Religiously following 
local food trucks on social media 
sites will eventually yield great divi-
dends — a fact I know to be true. It 
definitely doesn’t hurt if the afore-
mentioned food truck just happened 
to participate in The Great Food 
Truck Race over the past summer. 
My coworkers and I spent weeks 
rhapsodizing over Devilicious food 
truck’s tasty menu (butter-poached 
lobster grilled cheese, anybody?), 
and our moment of glory came 
when their twitter feed announced 
a 100-person strong free sandwich 
giveaway. The kicker? It was eight 
minutes away from our office.

After giving an embarrassingly 
hasty explanation of my sudden 
departure to my boss, my friends 
and I hightailed it out of the office. 
The impending threat of a cafeteria 
lunch was too great — we could not 
fail. Several close disastrous driving 
encounters later (we were in a rush), 
we arrived at the tweeted location. 
Actually, they were a little more 
cryptic than that, but their riddle 
about Katy Perry did not hold up 
against two arts and entertainment 
interns. 

But despite it all, despite the fact 
that we were less than ten minutes 
away from their location, despite the 
fact that we left early, or that you 
know, we were speeding, we were 
#47, 48 and 49 in line. And nobody 
ahead of us in line even looked like 
they stumbled out of the stores in 
the surrounding area — these were 
bona fide hungry hipsters. Even 
though we had snagged a free sand-
wich, we just got told. 

The food, of course, was fantas-
tic. It’s pretty hard to top a fried soft 
shell crab club sandwich slathered 
in thousand island, fresh greens and 
pickles on sourdough bread — oh, 
and for free. Especially after six 
hours of a desk job that mainly con-
sists of staring at a screen and fur-
rowing at letters to the editor. 

Life lesson: Food trucks inspire 
fanatical levels of devotion. Free 
food — even more. And no matter 
how quick you think you are, people 
will (eerily) be faster. Getting free 
food is a competition — there is no 
time for helpful Facebook groups 
that clog up free food events with 
awkward jostles for the last potato 
skin.

EDITORIALS

Last Tuesday, University of California President Mark G. Yudof announced a bold plan: No more tuition hikes — at least 
for the coming year. Instead of the purported 
16-percent tuition increase for the 2012-13 aca-
demic year, he plans to ask the state for a $400 
million budget increase, a solution that, if imple-
mented, would fill the UC system’s budget deficit. 
Hold your applause though. This brash statement 
will soon be clarified in a postponed UC Regents 
meeting that was supposed to happen this week, 
a meeting that would clarify the logic gaps of this 
rather improbable plan. 
      Whether this plan will work or not, this $400 
million increase proposal has good intentions. 
Yudof hopes to use $36.6 million of the $400 mil-
lion to increase student enrollment by 1 percent, 
or 2,100 students. This increase in students would 
allow the UC system to fulfill its master plan’s 
goal of admitting all eligible students, thought it 
would cause a great deal more competition for 
classes. In addition, $310 million more would be 

used to smooth over the damages — smaller class 
sizes, professor and staff layoffs — caused by 
budget cuts in years past. 

But the state of California can hardly afford 
to fund Yudof ’s whimsy. It is, after all, facing a 
$5-to-8 billion dollar deficit. UC funding from 
the state has dropped $650 million this year 
already, and if the mid-year budget doesn’t line 
up (and let’s face it — it won’t), the UC system 
will see its funding further cut by $100 million 
dollars this coming winter. The sobering reality 
of these numbers puts the feasibility of Yudof ’s 
proposal in practice — few in Sacramento will 
respond warmly to this request. 

This year, the UC system received $2.4 billion 
after budget cuts, in comparison to $3.25 billion 
in 2007-8. And now, Yudof is asking for $2.8 
billion for 2012-13. According to Vice President

Yudof ’s promise to stave off  tuition increases and request $400 million from 
the state might have the right intentions, but it’s a proposal that holds no air. 

See FUNDINGÊpage 5

As the academic year rolls on, it is becom-ing increasingly obvious that student transportation must face cuts.  In an 
effort to reduce costs, a plan was proposed by 
UCSD Transportation Services to consolidate 
the Hillcrest/campus and the Hillcrest/Old Town 
shuttles into one route by April 2012. According to 
the Assistant Director of Transit Operations, Todd 
Berven, the shuttles do not have enough riders to 
remain financially stable — the Old Town shuttle 
costs UCSD over $8 a person per trip. But this new 
plan will not only double students’ time to get to 
school from Hillcrest; it also abruptly disadvan-
tages students mid-year.

The shuttle consolidation affects students who 
live in Hillcrest, North Park, Mission Hills, City 
Heights and other neighboring areas — all of 
whom can’t exactly pick up and move in the mid-
dle of the year. When students moved to Hillcrest, 
an area neighboring downtown San Diego, they 
chose their location with the knowledge that 
there would be public transportation to campus. 
Therefore, to avoid the high prices of parking 
permits and gas-guzzling search for parking, these 
students are dependent on the shuttle system.  

The current commute is about 20 minutes on 
the bus, according to Muir College senior Nena 
Eichelberger, but with the new transportation sys-
tem a trip could take up to an hour in La Jolla traf-
fic. Combined with a 133-student parking space 
reduction last fall and the climbing cost of parking 
permits to $732 annually, this consolidation further 
compounds the already existing disadvantages of 
public transportation. And, despite the fact that the 
two routes are merging, the buses will not arrive 
more frequently — further limiting time flexibility 
and increasing crowding. The last bus arrives at 
9 p.m., which ignores the possibility of late night 
classes and club meetings. If UCSD consolidates 
the two shuttle routes, the buses need to arrive 
more frequently and run until a later time. 

 Ramin Hashemi, a senior who depends on the 
shuttle system, started a Facebook campaign and 
petition to save the route in response to student 
frustration. Students also attended meetings about 
the shuttle consolation this week to contribute their 
ideas. Students should use the student representa-
tives in the Transportation Policy Committee as 
a resource to get more information and get more 
involved. It is important that students support the 

cause and voice their opinions, since student pas-
sengers dominate the Hillcrest/campus route. 

While the reduction of the shuttle route may 
be inevitable, UCSD should at least let students 
finish out the year with the two bus routes so that 
they have the summer to figure out their living 
and transportation situation. Inevitably, cuts will 
be made, whether it be funds from MTS shuttles, 
elimination of campus loop or increasing fees in 
other areas. UCSD can take other actions, such as 
imposing a $25-per-quarter transportation fee, a 
proposal that failed in 2010. 

Currently, it costs UCSD about $3 a person 
per trip on the Hillcrest shuttle, a trip funded by 
revenues from on-campus drivers though the 
purchase of parking passes. As a last-ditch effort, 
UCSD could look to further increasing the price of 
parking permits.

For students with cars, keeping the shuttles 
could mean more fees and higher permit costs. 
But if students without cars lose the shuttles, they 
will have to move from Hillcrest to a more expen-
sive and more local residence in areas like UTC. 
Whatever changes are made, students should have 
ample time to prepare for changes made.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 17,  2011 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 5

Dear Editor,
State Controller John Chiang’s 

office reported last week that tax 
receipts are about $1.5 billion 
lower than state budget architects 
anticipated through the first four 
months of the fiscal year. 

 “I think we’re in for a rough 
ride for the next couple of years 
in terms of the budget, but we 
are going to promote invest-
ments in the state because I think 
they’re crucial,” Gov. Jerry Brown 
said. Even though the cost of 
the California Bullet Train has 
doubled, Brown said it is manage-
able over the 23-year construction 
period. 

 With no apology to the editors 
of the Guardian, Gov. Brown will 
formally request that the legislature 
approve billions of dollars to start 
construction of the California bul-
let train next year.  He will work 
hard to persuade skeptical lawmak-
ers that the project is critical to the 
state’s future.

Brown said that he anticipates 
there will be a broad need for the 
system in the long term and that it 
represents a significantly cheaper 
alternative to additional highway 
and commercial aviation invest-
ments.

“Where the hell is the High 
Speed Rail going to come up with 
$100+ billion?” the Guardian asks.

 By now Gov. Brown has 
answered wisely — “President 
Abraham Lincoln came up with 
the dough-rey-mi to build the 
transcontinental railroad during 
the Civil War, and we built the 
Golden Gate Bridge during the 
Great Depression.”

 What I want to know — as a 
UC San Diego ‘83 alumnus — is 

how did Japan, flattened during 
World War II by multiple satura-
tion bombings, and two nuclear 
bombings, come up with the 
wherewithal to build The Tōkaidō 
Shinkansen in time for the ‘64 
Tokyo Olympics?  

 The bullet train carries over 
150 million passengers a year. 
Moreover, it has transported more 
passengers (over 4 billion, network 
over 6 billion) than any other high-
speed rail line in the world without 
a single fatal accident.

 Shinkansen service was an 
immediate success, increasing 
new traffic demand:  It reached 
the 100 million passenger mark 
in less than three years, and one 
billion passengers nine years later. 
Sixteen-car trains were introduced 
for Expo ‘70 in Osaka. 

 The Tōkaidō Line’s rapid suc-
cess prompted an extension west-
ward to Hiroshima and Fukuoka 
(the Sanyō Shinkansen), which was 
completed in 1975.

 The rail construction wouldn’t 
destroy businesses, damage 
farms and displace homes along 
the route. I always enjoy watch-
ing Mt. Fuji whizzing past.  But 
if the industrial arts building at 
Bakersfield High School can’t 
be moved 300 feet or so, a slight 
diversion could be introduced.

$412 million boost,” and the state hasn’t given the UC 
system its requested funds since the early 2000s. Given 
this previous track record, Yudof ’s plan is looking less 
and less inspiring. 

Most notably, the 2011-12 budget cuts have rocked 
the system this past year. This marks the first year that 
student tuition paid more into UC income than support 
from the state of California — in-state tuition was raised 
18.3-percent this year, a $1,900 increase. Tuition aside, 
state budget cuts have shortened library hours (or shut 
libraries down altogether), cut class offerings and led to 
innumerable faculty departures. Yudof hopes to at least 
reverse some of these problems with his state budget 
proposal. 

It’s a worthy cause, to be sure, but UC officials have 
readily acknowledged that this proposal is more of a 
“wish list” than a demand. After all, these demands hap-
pen nearly every year around this time — the UC system 

calculates the amount it needs to continue running and 
tells lawmakers. And every year, like clockwork, the state 
refuses to up the budget and UC officials are forced to 
consider, again, the possibility of tuition raises.

But Yudof isn’t without a backup plan. If the funds 
from the state do not materialize come March, he will 
revisit the idea of raising student tuition. In a controver-
sial announcement in September, tuition would increase 
between 8 to 16 percent every year until 2016. At the end 
of this tuition hike, students would end up paying more 
than $22,000 just for basic in-state tuition. The fallout 
from this announcement was immense. Several days 
later, the Regents distanced themselves from the plan, 
saying they wanted nothing to do with it. They hoped 
that the $1 billion gap would be bridged elsewhere — 
apparently, this is their solution. 

But if this is the best bridging plan the UC Regents 
can come up with, then students might as well brace 
themselves for an onslaught of tuition hikes come March.

I ’m sorry world — I don’t like Zooey Deschanel. I fall into the camp of peo-ple who roll their eyes when she does 
something “adorkable,” instead of break-
ing out into a spontaneous rendition of 
“You Make My Dreams Come True.” 

So when I approached Fox’s new fall 
comedy “New Girl,” starring everyone’s 

favorite Deschanel (sorry Emily), I did 
so with caution. I tried not to judge too 
hard, not to flare my nostrils every single 
time Jess tried to dance or attempt to pro-
nounce the word “penis.” And in the end, 
I made up my mind: “New Girl” isn’t the 
worst show in the history of television. 

For one, the supporting characters 
actually make me laugh from week to 
week. Schmidt (Max Greenfield), the 
overconfident, rarely successful lothario 
of the “boys” nails every line while never 
losing a straight face. And Schmidt’s 
foil, the almost-characterless Winston, 
provides much needed filler dialogue 
between Schmidt’s douchey rants and 
Jess’ fleeting bouts of insanity.

The final two characters don’t fare 
as well. Jake M. Johnson, who plays the 
puppy dog, down-in-luck Nick, whim-
pers and generally acts pathetic in front 
of his ex-girlfriend. Of course, he is 
predestined to eventually get together 
with Jess — every episode acts as a hor-
rible sort of relationship foreplay for the 
pair. First, Jess learns how to act like an 
adult in front of a restaurant. Next, Nick 
learns how to act like an adult in front of 
a wedding. Then, Jess sees Nick naked 
and learns how to say the word “penis.” I 
imagine great things in the future for the 
two. I just don’t want to see it.

And Zooey Deschanel, well, she’s 
“New Girl”’s crowning glory, the reason 
behind a thousand hipster dreams. For 
some fans of the show, she is utter perfec-
tion — her big blue eyes and eccentrici-
ties keep them entertained far more than 
any joke on the show could. But for me, 
when I watch Deschanel on screen, I 
just see an actress trying way too hard 
to play a role that isn’t even enjoyable. 
She is simply an overgrown child in an 
Anthropologie mannequin’s body, trying 
her best to say the darndest things at the 
quirkiest times. 

In fact, the more I watch Deschanel 
prance on-screen, the more I enjoy 
the “30 Rock” version of the character, 
Liz Lemon. Tina Fey does everything 
Deschanel tries to do, but in an actually 
entertaining fashion. Lemon is a char-
acter that basks in her intelligence, yet 
lacks the social skills to meander through 
the terrible lifelong challenges of finn-
icky writers, insane boyfriends and her 
impending midlife crisis. 

Her fantastic repartee with her boss-
mentor, Jack Donaghy, is a type of social 
interaction that Jess lacks on “New Girl.” 
Instead of giving her direction, her brood 
of man-boys propels Jess to never-ending 
levels of stupidity and awkwardness 
(Singing “I Had the Time of My Life” 
in the middle of a crowded restaurant 
comes to mind.) 

But still, the show actually makes me 
laugh from time to time, though usually 
when Zooey Deschanel is off-screen — a 
fact that is unfortunately not enough to 
keep me watching.

Murs (L.A.’s Nick Carter) is no ordinary West Coast rapper. Greatly respected yet remarkably down to earth, he is a character 
who bubbles with infectious enthusiasm and 
ambition. 

Murs’ current tour coincides with the release 
of his latest album Love and Rockets Vol. 1: 
The Transformation. Gone are his recognizable 
dreadlocks, but his unique delivery and story-
telling style remains characteristic of the music. 
Following a brief spell at Warner Brothers, Love 
and Rockets Vol. 1 is released on BluRoc — a 
label, Murs admits, with an entirely different 
philosophy to his previous partner. 

“There was definitely a more familial 
atmosphere,” he said in an interview with the 

Guardian. “There were lots of creative people 
getting their tasks completed in a very chaotic 
way. It was like a reality show with 18 brothers 
or sisters living in the same house — but with 
added weed! It was certainly an interesting 
change of pace.”

Murs has been praised for his willingness 
to tackle issues from which the vast majority of 
modern rappers tend to shy away. Accordingly, 
“Animal Style,” the last track on Love and 
Rockets Vol. 1, directly confronts homophobic 
attitudes through a touching narrative chroni-
cling a tragic homosexual relationship. Murs 
attributes this sentiment to personal experience.

“I have friends and family that are gay, or 
that I feel are gay and leading an ‘alternative 
lifestyle,’ that haven’t come out or feel uncom-
fortable,” he said. “As an artist I want to be an 
advocate for gay and lesbian teens across the 
world and help empower them.”

And love is a reoccurring theme on the 
record, though not always from the romantic’s 
point of view. Clearly articulated is Murs’ pas-
sionate love for California and for true hip-hop, 
most clearly demonstrated on “Eazy-E,” a heart-
felt homage to the West Coast scene. But Murs 
attests that his influences are limited neither 
by region or genre, citing anyone from Curtis 
Mayfield to Vampire Weekend and Jack White 
as personal favorites.

“This morning I’ve been in awe of Redman,” 
he said. “I know every song he has done and the 
words to every skit.” 

Now an experienced and successful fixture 
in hip-hop, Murs is eager to do what he can 
to pass down his understanding of the music 
business. In the long run, this aim involves 
plans to branch out into management and label 

arts&entertainment

ownership, but for now he continues to aid the 
development of young talent through Paid Dues, 
his annual independent hip-hop festival in San 
Bernardino. 

“Last year was our biggest year: We had an 
attendance of over 10,000,” he said. “Organizing 
the event can be very frustrating, but when I 
walk the grounds and I see the kids that have 
come and they’re happy and having such a good 
time — it definitely makes it worth it.”

Despite his undoubted love for hip-hop, it is 
when conversation turns from music that Murs 
reveals his true enthusiasms. Emphasizing the 
importance of education, he speaks passionately 
about his desire to develop the projects he has 
already begun in poverty-stricken Ethiopia. 

“We want to help older children help their 
communities in ways that they see fit, listening 
to them instead of telling them what they need 
or dropping food from the sky,” he said. 

Closer to home, Murs dedicates time to vol-
unteer work with disabled children. 

“It was indescribable,” he said of time spent 
at an autistic summer camp earlier this year. “I 
cried a few times and laughed a lot. All of them 
are just so pure and loving and positive and 
funny in their own ways.”

Murs plans to release an installment of the 
Love and Rockets series annually, and also has 
plans to produce free mix tapes, “just for the 
fans,” every six months. It is the reward of his 
humanitarian projects, however, which appear 
to explain his relentless enthusiasm for making 
music.

“I want to keep entertaining and making a lot 
of money because when people buy my records, 
it all goes to someone — adopting more kids, 
sending kids to school or donating to autism 
research,” he said. “These are things that keep 
me inspired.” 

As a key player in an industry wrought with 
extravagance and self-interest, it is clear that 
Murs is an artist assured of a unique legacy.

I t’s hard to imagine George Clooney as the working class man. For one, he’s the spitting image of the leading 
man — tailored suit, arm-candy, pearly 
whites and all — but, more importantly, he 
acts like one. His role as a charming and 
emotionally-detached businessman in 2009’s 
“Up In the Air” fits him like a glove, allowing the actor to play with his 
own cool persona rather than attempt to create someone different (and 
probably less interesting). 

Which is why it’s initially hard to imagine the eternal bachelor as 
one of Alexander Payne’s lonely grumps in the family drama “The 
Descendants.” Payne’s films (“About Schmidt,” “Sideways”) are about 
men forced to confront a lifetime of regret. Never younger than middle 
age, these men spend most of their respective films dealing with the 
recent loss of a wife (through either death or divorce) and the ineptitude 
they’ve earned with age. 

“The Descendants” is no different. Clooney plays workaholic 
Honolulu lawyer Matt King, the self-proclaimed “back-up parent” to 
two daughters — sassy 10 year old Scottie (Amara Miller, with the 
award for biggest pout of the year) and acerbic 17 year old Alexandria 
(Shailene Woodley) — who has to learn to take center stage when his 
wife Elizabeth gets into a water skiing accident that puts her in a coma. 

At the same time, King’s got a big decision to make. His great-great-
grandmother was a Hawaiian princess who married a white banker and 
left her descendants a fat chunk of pristine island real estate. As the pri-
mary beneficiary of the land, King must choose whether to sell the land 
to developers or keep it untouched. 

Then, as he finally seems to get it together, he gets a double dose of 
bad news: His wife will never wake from her coma, and she was cheat-
ing on him before her accident — a piece of news which sets King and 
his family on an island-hopping trip to find his wife’s lover.

It almost sounds like the recipe for a tearjerker of a Lifetime movie, 
but Payne is no sentimentalist. The script — an adaptation of a 2009 
novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, co-written by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash 
— is rife with dry humor. The sad is always balanced with the funny, as 
if the tragedies of life have a peculiar kind of comedy to them. Even the 
most emotional moments — King yelling at his wife’s unconscious body 
in the hospital — bring the kind of laughs that sting and linger long past 
the initial scene. 

And the actors nail the tragi-comedy. Clooney is surprisingly 
convincing as the sad sack father, giving the kind of emotionally raw 
performance you’d never expect from the red carpet silver fox. The kids 
are just as committed too — Woodley (TV’s “The Secret Life of the 
American Teenager”), in particular, gives a performance that stands up 
to Clooney’s star power. 

But what’s made Payne’s other films such cutthroat, hilarious gems is 
the fact that his characters are total assholes. Jack Nicholson’s widower 
in “About Schmidt” is seriously unpleasant, while the two friends in 
“Sideways” are selfish jerks. But here, even the neglectful husband and 
unfaithful wife seem like good people thrown into terrible situations.

“The Descendants” is then the sweetest we’ve ever seen Payne — and 
a refreshing development for the director. Too bad he works better with 
the overpowering taste of the sour.

MOVIE REVIEW

Although the casting of Michelle Williams as Marilyn Monroe in “My 
Week With Marilyn” initially 
drew criticism from fans of the 
starlet of all starlets, Williams’ 
portrayal of the larger-than-life 
movie star is eerily spot-on: 
bleached golden curls, wide 
camera-ready smile, flirty naiveté. However, the latest film 
from director Simon Curtis is not so much a biopic about 
the actress as it is a brief glimpse of one man’s fleeting rela-
tionship with her.

Wide-eyed 23-year-old Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne), 
eager to get a foot in the film business, lands a job as 
third assistant director on the set of “The Prince and the 
Showgirl” — a 1957 film starring Monroe and Laurence 
Olivier (Kenneth Branagh). 

Based on Clark’s autobiographical books, “My Week 
With Marilyn” acts as a backstage account of the 1957 film, 
as well as a heartfelt coming-of-age story for Clark, as he 
develops a close friendship with Monroe.

Initially, Monroe is depicted as unreliable and diva-like 
— she shows up late to the film’s table read, must always be 
accompanied by her method acting coach and frequently 
stumbles her lines. “The Prince and the Showgirl” director 
and star Olivier quickly grows annoyed with her behavior, 
and her use of method acting conflicts with his brand of 
old school stage acting. 

Branagh (“Rabbit-Proof Fence,” “Harry Potter and the 
Chamber of Secrets”), always a compelling screen presence, 
provides much of the film’s light comedic relief. Owning 
the role of the high-strung director, he hilariously rejectis 
his own cigarettes in favor of something stronger in one 
memorable scene. 

As the film icon, Williams is glowing and goddess-like 
in nearly every shot. Her motions are often slowed, as if 
she is constantly posing for the eager public. Tight shots of 
Williams’ eyes and ruby-red smile feed the construction of 
the actress, as the camera work dually pins Monroe as both 
familiar and impossibly enigmatic — an intriguing docu-

ment of her household celebrity. 
In his first major role, Redmayne as Clark is believable 

as the bashful kid who easily falls under Monroe’s charm. 
However, the romantic pairing of boyish Clark and glamor-
ous Monroe is never truly convincing, as Monroe treats 
Clark more like a pet than a romantic interest.   

But the film makes up for its unchallenging plot with 
a cast of high-caliber actors. Curtis — of primarily British 
television and theater background — achieves standout 
performances from the supporting cast that includes 
Judi Dench, Dougray Scott, Dominic Cooper and Emma 
Watson.

It is Williams, however, who shines brightest in her 
memorable turn as Monroe. Williams — last seen in her 
Oscar-nominated role in 2010’s “Blue Valentine” — has 
grown with each film. Her commitment to the role is evi-
dent: Williams claimed she ate, drank and slept Marilyn 
in order to transform into the pop culture icon — and she 
nails the facial expressions, seductive movements and sing-
ing to a T. It’s easy to forget Williams herself isn’t an inter-
national superstar, and after such a gripping performance, 
perhaps it’s only a matter of time before she is.

WOMEN’S CREW — The UCSD Women’s Crew team 
closed out its fall season at Mission Bay in the San Diego 
Fall Classic on Sunday, Nov. 13, where the Tritons com-
peted against Division I University of San Diego. UCSD 
fielded boats in both the Collegiate Eight and Novice 
Eight divisions in a time trial format. The novice eight 
boat finished first with a time of 22.44.0, a minute in front 
of both of USD’s boats — which cut the course buoys and 
were given a penalty. The varsity eight had a strong per-
formance, finishing the course in 22.17.0, taking second 

place behind USD who clocked in at 21.3.0.
“We raced well and were able to hold off USD’s B and 

C boats,” varsity eight rower Ashley Travaglione said. “We 
were within range of their A boat, which is really good 
for us considering they have an extra month on the water 
than we do.” The Tritons will continue their season in the 
spring, with their next meet slated for Saturday, March 3 in 
Newport Beach.

“It was a good way to end the fall season and now we are 
working towards getting better shape and becoming more 
technically sound for spring,” Travaglione said.

Crew Rows Strong at Mission Bay
MEN’S BASKETBALL — The UCSD Men’s Basketball team games 
will soon be available on your radio dial. For the first time, the Triton 
basketball games will broadcast over the airwaves of ESPN Radio 
1700AM. 

Starting this Tuesday, Nov. 22, every home game for the rest of the 
season and four road games will be announced by voice of TritonTalk, 
Creg Elsten and Executive Producer at XX Sports 1090 and ESPN 1700, 
Jack Cronin. Elsten will handle the play-by-play, while Cronin will 
handle the color commentary. Chris Carlson, who enters his fifth year 
as UCSD head coach after a stint with UCLA, was happy to finally have 
his team’s games broadcast.

“We’re very pleased that fans in San Diego will be able to listen to 
our broadcasts this year,” Carlson said. “We play in one of the best 
Division II conferences in the country and I think people will be 
genuinely pleased with all that UCSD Basketball and the CCAA has 
to offer.”

Associate Athletic Director Ken Grosse was just as excited. 
“It was an opportunity that, you know, I just couldn’t pass up” 

Grosse said, “I think it’s a great opportunity.” The first game to be 
broadcast will be the Tritons’ home matchup against Cal State San 
Bernardino in their CCAA opener on Tuesday at 7 p.m.

as well as defend, but middle-of-the-pack defenders at the 
international level (and definitely at the collegiate level) 
usually just need to be disciplined, big-bodied or quick.

Clubs have figured this out. Covering the goal with 
defenders has allowed some low-salary, third division 
squads to remain competitive. And although the game is 
ugly — the play is stagnant, the players interchangeable — 
at least they’re losing games 2-0 and not 6-1.

Collegiate soccer coaches have followed suit. Last 
Sunday night, the box score credited Chico State with five 
defenders, four midfielders (who rarely crossed into the 
attacking third after they took the 1-0 advantage) and only 
a single forward.

The five back system is not unheard of, but it’s rare in the 
U.S., where the 4-4-2 system of play has been entrenched in 
American youth soccer. There are obvious advantages to the 
system if you’re lacking attacking power or offensive flare, 
but the trade-off (at least from the point-of-view of the fan) 
is a total loss of the intricate ballwork and creative move-

ment that I love about soccer. 
This worries me for two reasons. One, it creates a market 

for bigger, stronger, physically superior players with less 
skill or creativity. Two, it will endanger the popularity of the 
sport by making a game that a lot of Americans already find 
too slow, even slower.

But, not all soccer coaches at the collegiate or interna-
tional level are focusing on defense. In fact, most teams 
are opting for the Spanish adaptation of the Dutch Total 
Football — a style of play where every player is dangerous 
because every player poses a threat to goal.

Credit UCSD’s head coach Brian McManus, whose 
squad plays a brand of soccer that rewards creativity and 
flair. With their defenders pushing all the way into the 
attacking third and their forwards pushing all the way back 
to defend, the system is sturdy, yet also dynamic and excit-
ing to watch. 

Unfortunately, on Sunday, Chico’s defense won out over 
McManus’ flare. For the sake of American soccer, I hope 
that’s a trend that doesn’t continue.ESPN to broadcast

12 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 17,  2011 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

BY NICK HOWE
Associate Sports Editor

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — Yesterday, the 
women’s volleyball team headed to Cal State 
San Bernardino to play in the West Regionals 
of the NCAA Tournament for the fifth con-
secutive year.

The 64-team field is split into West, South, 
Atlantic, Central, East, Midwest, Southcentral 
and Southeast. Each region is represented by 
eight teams. The Tritons will be making their 
11th appearance in the national tournament.

The Tritons are seeded No. 2 in the West 
with a 21—5 overall record, ranked behind No. 
1 Cal State San Bernardino, who will host the 
West Regionals. 

Sonoma State receives the third seed in the 
West, despite beating the Tritons in regular 
season play. BYU-Hawaii receives the fourth 
seed, Seattle Pacific gets the fifth spot, Hawaii-
Hilo is ranked No. 6, Grand Canyon at No. 7 
and Alaska Anchorage seeded No. 8.

Seventh-seed Grand Canyon — which will 
make its first tournament appearance since 
1995 — would seem to be an easy target for 
the Tritons, but the Antelopes have had an 
impressive season. Grand Canyon finished the 
regular season with a 22—6 overall record after 
a stunning 14-game winning streak, good for 
second place in the Pacific West Conference. 
UCSD has fought through two nine-game 
winning streaks, disrupted by Sonoma and 
CSUSB, respectively.

Senior outside hitters Roxanne Brunsting 
and Hillary Williamson will play today after 
garnering All-CCAA First Team honors for 
their standout seasons. Both Tritons finish 

their regular seasons with over 1,000 career 
kills apiece — Williamson with over 1,000 
digs. Senior Katie Condon also received All-
CCAA honors with a Second Team nomi-
nation. Comparatively, San Bernardino had 
three First Team spots and two Second Team 
selections.

The ‘Lopes are no easy prey, and if the 
Tritons want to win, they will need to play 
together to hide their own weaknesses and 
play up their strengths. If the Tritons can 
secure a win in the first round, they will face 
Sonoma and CSUSB at some point, both of 
whom have beaten the Tritons in the past. 

However, UCSD did manage to beat 
Sonoma last year in the quarterfinals of the 

regional tournament, and if they can beat No. 
1 nationally ranked San Bernardino, UCSD 
will likely be looking at a real shot at a national 
title this year.

The farthest into NCAA National 
Tournament the women’s volleyball team has 
gone was the Sweet 16, round four of post-
season play. This was back in 2007, when they 
defeated then-ranked No. 4 San Bernardino 
in the finals of the regional tournament to 
move on to the National Championship round, 
where the Tritons lost in the first round to 
(1—3) to No. 2 Minnesota Duluth.

MEN’S WATER POLO — The No. 11 nation-
ally ranked UCSD Men’s Water Polo team 
finishes the regular season with a 14—9 overall 
record.

Now heading into the postseason, 
the Tritons will play host to the WWPA 
Conference Championships, with the second 
seed. The 12-team tournament will take place 
at Canyonview Pool from Nov. 17 to Nov. 20. 

On Tuesday, the All-Conference WWPA 
teams were announced, with five Tritons 
awarded with all-conference honors. Senior 
goalkeeper David Morton — UCSD’s current 
record-holder for career saves with 1,033 — 
and junior utility John Butler received first-
team honors, while seniors Graham Saber 
and Brian Donohoe were named second-team 

selections. Two-meter Matthew Michalko was 
also named to the All-Freshman team.

In his 32nd year as head coach, Denny 
Harper was awarded the conference coach of 
the year for the 16th time in his career.

The top four seeds — first-seed Loyola 
Marymount, second-seed UCSD, third-seed 
Santa Clara and fourth-seed UC Davis — 
received a first-round bye.

The Tritons’ first match is slated for this 
Friday, Nov. 17 at 4:30 p.m. in the quarter-
final round. UCSD will face the winner of 
the first round bout between seventh-seed 
Claremont and tenth-seed Whittier. UCSD 
has only faced Claremont and Whittier on 
one occasion apiece, taking commanding wins 
over both squads.

With a 12-3 conference record, the Tritons’ 
only three losses were dealt by the first-seeded 
Loyola Marymount Lions. In their 23rd game 

season, the Tritons have faced off against the 
Lions four times, topping Loyola only once 
on Oct. 2 in the SoCal tournament 9-5. The 
two programs have been the only winners of 
the WWPA Conference championships for the 
past 11 years.

Unfortunately, the Tritons enter the post-
season on a two-game losing streak, after 
dropping to No. 1 nationally ranked UCLA 4-9 
and No. 5 Irvine 11-15.

However, with their five All-Conference 
team selections as well as conference coach 
of the year Denny Harper, the Tritons 
seem poised to perform well in the WWPA 
Championships. UCSD will look to win the 
12-team tournament in hopes of receiving 
the automatic bid to the NCAA Division II 
National Championships.

UCSD to Face Grand Canyon in NCAA’s

Last weekend, the UCSD Women’s Soccer 
team fell to Chico State 1-0, and was escorted 
(prematurely) out of the NCAA National tour-
nament. 

The Wildcats scored just 20 minutes into the 
match, giving UCSD plenty of time to equalize. 
But with 70 minutes remaining in regulation, 
Chico had largely given up the attack and was 
focused on double-teaming the Triton for-
wards. 

As a fan of our women’s soccer team, it was 
a hard game to watch, with UCSD floundering 
after finding itself a goal down. But as a fan of 
the “beautiful game,” it was just plain ugly.

Ugly — not in head-butting Zinedine 
Zidane terms (I don’t mind a good skirmish 
on the pitch) — but in the way in which that 
2006 World Cup final played out, with Italy and 
France playing to a timid 1-1 draw.

Granted, the Italians are infamous for stock-
piling their backline, hoping for a goal on a 
counter and then hunkering down to protect 
the lead. While this “wait-it-out” strategy has 
proven effective for the Italians, it certainly isn’t 
as exciting as the dynamic Brazilian style or the 
fluidity of the Dutch. 

But in the schema of international soccer, 
defense is simply cheaper. In the 2009-10 sea-
son all five of the top paid players were flat-out 
sublime goal-scorers. Cristiano Ronaldo sits at 
the top of this list, setting Real Madrid back 
a cool $132 million. Obviously, goal scoring 
is a much more expensive skill set, requiring 
superior field vision, pace, foot skills and strik-
ing ability. 

Defense, on the other hand, can be fudged. 
Field vision: preferable but not necessary. Foot 
skills: negotiable. Certainly, top-class defenders 
are brilliant readers of the game and can attack 

Does the 
Beautiful 
Game Need 
a Makeover?
Defense-minded soccer won’t 
help the sport’s popularity in 
the U.S.
