Students, groups split 
over role of loans in aid 

Fox rejects bid to block ledure 
Groups worried talk could spark violence 

By MADELINE PHft.UPS 
Staff Writer 

In anticipation of the reautho-
rization of the Higher Education 
Act, lawmakers have begun to see a 
growing rift between college lead-
ers, who want to increase the maxi-
mum amount that students can 
borrow through federal student 
loan programs, and student-inter-
~st groups, who oppose such an 
mcrease. 

Both President George W. Bush 
and the House of Representatives 
have developed plans for increas-
ing loan caps, which limit how 
much students can borrow through 
government-subsidjzed programs. 
Under the House bill, the limit for 
freshman students would increase 
from $2,625 to $3 ,500 and sopho-
more limits would rise from $3,500 
to $4,500. The president's plan 
is similar, except it would also 
increase the overall total an under-
graduate can borrow from $23,000 
to $24,875. 

However, College Parents of 
America, a national advocacy group 
that represents parents of college 

students:~tmiversities and other 
interested corporations, would like 
an even larger change, increasing 
the total to $30,000 and giving stu-
dents more flexibility in how much 
_they could borrow each year . 

. "Borrowing only gets you so far 
under the present federal limita-
tions," CPA President James A. 
Boyle said. "The limits currently 
in place are so outdated as to cause 
students to borrow from private 
lenders, wruch are more dang rous 
and certainly more expensive." 

To accommodate rising tujtion 
prices, the group has backed plans 
for increasing the amount students 
can borrow. 

"Students will be borrowing 
a lot in the fore~cO;:::h!,. future," 
Boyle said. "We believe loan limjts 
should be in rea sed more dramati-
cally." 

Some student groups, however, 
believe that increasing loan limits 
would place grants - their real 
priority - in the background. 

"Loans are not the answer; they 
are only making it more djfficult

Despite objections from same-
sex-rights activists, the College 
Republicans carried out plans for a 
campus lecture featuring gay con-
servative talk-show host Steven 
Yuhas, who spoke in condemna-
tion of same-sex marriage. The 
April 22 event attracted approxi-
mately 40 people. 

Although gay-rights activ-
ists called for its cancellation and 
threatened to picket, the event 
took place as scheduled, without 
protests.

Union, university reach salary deal 
By AMY IFURUNG 

Staff Writer 

The University of Caljfornia 
and the American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal 
Employees Local 3299 reached a 
tentative agreement April 18 over 
wages for the more than 7,000 
unjversity service workers repre-
sented by the union. 

The agreement, still subject 
to ratification by unjon mem-
bers, includes a 10-percent wage 
increase for all service worke.rs. 
The increase will be implemented 
over three years beginning Oct. I, 
2005, if the agreement is ratified. 

Such increases are "consistent 
with the university's budget com-
pact with the governor and subject 
to final state-funding appropria-
tions in each year," UC spokes-
man Noel Van Nyhws sajd. 

Another element of the agree-
ment entails a $9-per-hour mini-
mum wage, an increase from the 
$8.32 wage currently paid to food 
service workers. 

The compromise also includes 
24 hours per year of paid educa-
tion leave, a minimum of one free 
meal per shift for food-service 
workers and a $250 retroactive 
pay increase for the 2004-05 year. 

The agreement makes no men-
tion, however, of a "step system" 
- a set of graduated, guaranteed 
salary increases for service work-
ers who decide to stay with their 
job for multiple years. The inclu-
sion of such a system was one 
of several goals proposed by the 
union for the new contract. 

Johnny Vy/Guardion 
SbiIdnt I dell: Following months of negotiations, the University of California and 
the AFSCME workers' union reached a tentative agreement for wages on April 18. 

"Workers are overjoyed that 
we were able to reach some kind . 
of conclusion ... but they're defi-
nitely sad that the agreement 
doesn't have anything about a 
step system," AFSCME organjzer 
Jessica Lopez said. 

Workers at all UC campuses 
will vote on the offer within the 
next three weeks. If ratified, terms 
of the agreement will become 
effective from the date of its pas-
sage through Jan. 31, 2008. If 
it fails, however, negotiations 
between the university and the 
union will begin again. 

"People are strongly consider-
ing the weight of three more years 
without a step system," Lopez 
said. "Workers are realizing the 
power they have when they're 
united. If they don't accept this 
[agreement) it will mean a lot 
- it means that they're willing to 

strike agajn." 
The unjversity, however, 

believes the agreement is both 
"fajr and financially realistic given 
our resources and the level of state 
salary funding promised under 
our budget compact with the gov-
ernor," UC Director of Labor 
Relations Howard Pripas stated in 
a press release. 

T he concessions by the uni-
versity, the union believes, are 
the direct result of the statewide 
one-day strike held April 14 at all 
UC campuses. . 

"We met with the university 
about 30 times before this strike, 
and we should have come to this 
conclusion a long time ago," 
Lopez said. "It's really apparent 
that it was the strike that got them 
to really bargain and go to the

Steven Yuhas to speak out against same-sex marriages in an April 22 event. 
invited various campus LGBT 
group to the talk in hopes that 
they would show up and engage

is when people are able to come to

Student satisfaction lags 
Riverside, Irvine campuses 

By KATE McELHINNEY 
Staff Writer 

UCSD students are less satisfied 
with their university experience 
than counterparts at UC Irvine and 
UC Riverside, findings from recent 
studies by the campus' Commjttee 
on Undergraduate Student 
Experience and Satisfaction show. 

Organized by Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox, the committee 
comprises two co-chairs, smdent 
representatives from all six colleges 
and allllIlIli, who consult on strate-
gies to elevate student satisfaction 
at UCSD. 

Committee co-chajr and 1998-
99 A.S. president Joe Leventhal 
said the campus' low numbers 
could be due to a lack of student 
and faculty interaction inside and 
outside of tlle classroom. 

"Smdents don't feel as connect-
ed to faculty at UCSD," Leventhal 
sajd. "The students are intimjdat-

ed by the facu lty, and the faculty 
thjnk the students don 't want to 
be there." 

By comparison, UC Riverside 
economics professor Gary Dymski 
said relations between students 
and faculty were closer-knit on his 
campus. 

"You can get personal attention 
[from faculty] and their doors are 
alway open," Dymski said. "Many 
students have had good working 
relationships and have benefited 
from these." 

Another reason for the discrep-
ancy in student satisfaction cou ld 
be negative atti tudes of students 
entering UCSD, accor<ling to 
Leventhal. 

"UCSD is not their first choice, 
so they're coming in with a nega-
tive attitude," Leventhal said. "And 
then sometime they don't get their 
first choice out of the ix colleges."

Union: University may 
file complaint for strike 

continued from page I 
table with us." 

The university, however, said 
the strike had nothing to do with 
the deal. 

"The strike- had no effect," 
Van Nyhuis said. "Our position 
all along was that our agreement 
would be dependent on state 
funding and in line with the gov-
ernor's compact" 

The university is currently con-
sidering filing an official complaint 
against the union over the strike, 
alleging that the actions violat-

ed state law because the strike 
occurred before impasse proceed-
ings between the universi ty and the 
union were officialJy over. 

The complaint wouJd be filed 
to the Public Employees Relations 
Board, the governing body that 
oversees union negotiations. 

"We haven't made any deci-
sions, but if we file a complaint to 
PERB, they will launch an inves-
tigation," Van Nyhuis said.

Loans: Students oppose 
increase in loan limits 

continued from page I 
for students, especially after they 
graduate," A.S. President Jenn 
Pae said. "Students are supposed 
to be getting financial aid in 
grants." 

The American Association of 
Community Colleges has also 
split from other higher education 
interest groups and announced 
its opposition to an increase in 
student loans. 

"We're not supporting 
an increase in loans, because 
we're concerned about our stu-
dents over borrowing," AACC 
Vice President for Government 
Relations David Baime said. 

However, UCSD Director of 
Financial Aid Vincent De Anda 
said he disagrees with the associa-
tion's perspective. 

"If it were a zero-sum game, 
then students would have a point. 
but I don't think that's the way 
it works," De Anda said. "If we 
keep the current loan maximums, 
it doesn't follow that we'll see an 
increase in Pell Grants. We're 
just worlcing on one program at 
a time and trying to increase the 
package all the way' around." 

Both De Anda and Pae said 
they agree that something should 
be done soon to fix the financial 

aid problems faced by many stu-
dents. Between 11,000 and 12,000 
UCSD students have loans of 
some type and about 90 percent 
of these have federal Stafford 
loans, according to De Anda. 

Though federal loans limit the 
amoWlt of interest lenders can 
charge students, private loans do 
not have similar protections. 

"Most of our students are 
reaching the current limits fairly 
quickly and having to take out less 
attractive loans," De Anda said. 

Students opposed to increasing 
loan limits have offered several 
suggestions as to how the federal 
student loan programs might be 
improved. A common point of 
criticism has been loan origina-
tion fees, charges paid by the 
borrowing student to the private 
lender for administrative costs. 

"I'm puJling in all of these 
loans, but I'm going to have to pay 
back twice as much or more with 
interest rates because of loan origi-
nation fees and the money given to 
the middlemen," Pae said. 

Groups like the United States 
Student Association are also lob-
bying for loan forgiveness pro-
grams, which allow the federal

Yale graduate student 
strike cancels classes 

Administrators at Yale University 
were forced to cancel approximately 
450 classes, affecting roughly 7,500 
undergraduates, as a result of a week-
long strike by the campus' graduate 
student teachers seeking recognition 
of its union and better benefits. 

The strike was one of two labor 
stoppages - the other took place at 
Columbia University - though graduate 
students across the country expressed 
their support by signing a joint declara-
tion of principle, asserting the rights of 
graduate students to organize. 

The labor disputes have been 
joined by solidarity actions at uni-
versities around the world, including 
some as distant as Australia. The 
European Parliament also issued a 
written declaration backing the unions 
representing graduate students at the 
two campuses, and the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson made an appearance at Yale 
in a shQw of support. 

A contract between New York 
University and its graduate students 
is also set to expire next year, and the 
university has suggested that it may 
choose not to renegotiate. 

The subject of collective bargaining 
for graduate students has attracted wide 
national attention over the past several 
years, including mixed rulings from the 
National Labor Relations Board. Last 
year, the University of Califomia signed 
a contract with its teaching assistants 
after the union representing them held 
a one-day strike. 

Researchers film 
cellular signals 

Researchers at Jacobs School of 
Engineering, with colleagues at UC 
Irvine, have for the first time captured 
on video footage of chemical signals 
moving through the cells of the body 
in response to tiny mechanical stimu-
lations. 

The video and technical details of 
their observations were released in 
conjunction with a paper published 
last week in the journal Nature. 

The researchers utilized a new 
molecular "reporter" system that 
allowed them to visually study the 
activation of a single protein. Post-doc-
torate researcher and lead author of 
the paper Peter Yingxiao Wang spent 
two years developing the system that 
causes reporter molecules to light up 
in response to a single protein . 

They predicted that current findings 
could be used to track the activation 
and movement of different proteins in 
the body. The technology could also 
be used to diagnose certain kinds of 
cancers, they said. 

Scripps team predicts 
Tahoe quake activity 

Using a unique combination of 
high-tech scientific instruments, 
researchers led by a team from 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography 
have produced the first-ever predic-
tions of earthquake activity in several 
fault areas of Lake Tahoe. 

In research to be published next 
month, the group analyzed more 
than 6Q,000 years of fault data. They 
predicted the occurrence of a large 
earthquake - measuring seven on 
the Richter scale - every 3,000 years 
in the region. Scientists at University of 
Nevada, Reno, have shown that such 
a shake could create tsuf)ami waves 
between three and 1 0 meters high. 

The team plans to study further 
the individual fault ruptures over the 
past several dozen millennia to get a 
better understanding of the role each 
fault has played in the earthquake 
cycle, a series of events scientists call 
"strain accumulation and rupture." 

New method indicates 
cancer cell severity 
In a study to be published next 

month, UCSD researchers will describe 
a new method they believe will make 
it easier for doctors to identify differ-
ences between nonmetastatic and 
highly metastatic breast-cancer cells. 

The new findings rely on varia-
tions in gene activity between differ-
ent cancer cell lines derived from the 
same human to assess the capability 
of the cells to spread to distant organs. 
Previous methods have looked at cel-
lular variations among different cancer 
patients, with genetic variation between 
subjects distorting the ability of scientists 
to make clear interpretations. 

The discovery, doctors predict, 
could someday lead to the identifi-
cation of "marker genes" that could 
quickly predict the behavior of tumors 
taken from human patients. 

UCLA scientists find 
HIV binding block 

Scientists believe that new findings 
by researchers at UCLA may lead to a 
new class of drugs capable of blocking 
sexually transmitted HIV infections. 

In a new study, the researchers 
have demonstrated that blocking the 
access of HIV to naturally occurring 
molecules on certain immune cells 
may reduce the ability of the cells to 
transport the infection into the body. 
The lesults of the study indicate that 
using other substances and antibodies 
to bind to the molecules may prevent 
its transmission .

Yuhas: Off'campus activist opposed event 
coiHinued from page I 

as intolerant homophobes because 
of their decision to bring Yuhas to 
campus. 

"I have received e-mails refer-
ring to College Republicans as the 
'College Hider Youth Brigade,'" 
Israel said, "They compared Steve 
spealcing at UCSD to I-litler speak-
ing to a rally of Jews. Using per-
sonal attacks is a way for them not 
to debate the issue." 

San Diego gay-rights activist 
Natahe Brown sent an e-mail to 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox, Chief 
Diversity Officer Jorge A. Huerta 
and various campus organizations 
calling for the cancellation of the 
College Republicans' event. Brown 
had also said she planned to hold 
peaceful protests at the talk. 

Israel, who compared the criti -
cism to that faced by blacks who 
oppose affirmative action policies, 
said he feels the protest threats 
have occurred because Yuhas' 
opinions are different from those 
of his critics. 

"I think Steve, as a gay conser-
_vative, is a real threat to this notion 
that gays do not have equal rights," 
he said. 

Brown unsuccessfully tried to 
use the campus' anti-discrimina-
tion policies to force the event's 
cancellation. 

She stated in the e-mail that 
"this event violates in every way 
the spirit of the anti-discrimina-
tion policy of UCSD and [Yuhas'] 
bigoted anti-gay hate speech could 
incite violence against LGBT stu-
dents on campus." 

]n an e-mai l response, Fox stat-
ed that all groups are entitled to 
free speech. 

"As a university, we place a 
very high va lue on free speech," 
Fox stated. "That's vital to the life 
of the university in order for the 
students, facuJty and staff in our 
community to form their own per-
sonal opinions after hearing varied 
aspects of an issue." 

In a separate e-mai l, Huerta 
stated that as chief diversity officer, 
he is responsible "for promoting 
and maintaining diversity on our 
campus in all of its many facets, 
which includes a diversity of opin-
ions on a variety of topics. ft 

"I hope that people on e.ither 
side of these issues can be toler-
ant with one another, no matter 
how much they disagree," Huerta 
stated. "If we cannot debate these 
very important issues in an atmo-
sphere of tolerance on a university 
campus, where else can we discuss 
and learn from one another?" 

Brown stated in her e-mail that 
Yuhas was an inappropriate speaker 

because of his harsh criticisms of 
the gay community, explaining that 
gays may become the target of vio-
lence because of his rhetoric. 

"He says things on his radio 
show every week against [the gay 
commu ni ty], and he does what he 
can to paint us all as freaks, then 
pretends that he is having a fair 
debate," she stated. "UCS D is a 
place for learning, not a place to let 
someone who is no different than 
the KKK come and hold a rally." 

Same-sex-rights activist and 
Revelle Coll ege Senior Senator 
Ted McCombs stated in an e-mail 
that, although he supports the 
College Republicans' right to free 
speech and believes that the group 
has the right to bring any speaker 
of its choice to campus, he wished 
that another speaker would have 
been chosen. 

"1 congratulate the [College 
Republicans] on their initiative, but I 
fear their association with Mr. Yuhas 
will only hurt them within the UCSD 
community, and reinforce the unfor-
tunate stereotype of Republicans as 
being a bunch of intolerant extrem-
ists who rely increasingly less on 
reason, and more on snide appeals 
to hatred," he stated.

Atkinson natning scandal 
exposes flaws in the systent 

By_IAN UIGA 
Senior Staff Writer 

N ormally, another toothless resolution from the A.S. Council would be cause 
for laughter and derision, but 
hopefully in this case the council 
will be taken seriously and some 
action will be taken as a result. 
A resolution passed unanimous-
ly during the council '5 April 20 
meeting calls for university offi-
cials to halt the naming of Sixth 
College "Atkinson College," after 
former UC President and UCSD 
Chancellor Richard Atlcinson, due 
to the complete and abject failure 
on the pan of university officiliis to 
solicit student input with regards 
to the name. 

But it gets better. The univer-
sity makes plenty of nasty deci-
sions without consulting students, 
such as the decision to remove 
student parlcing from all on-cam-
pus lots. But in the case of naming 
Sixth College, the university tried 
to sugarcoat its decision by enlist-
ing a single student representa-
tive to the Sixth College Executive 
Committee in charge of the nam-
ing decision, and then misinfonned 
that single student about the voting 
time so that the student could not 
be a part of the decision. The uni-
versity effectively forced through a 
hasty and politicized decision. 

One could easi ly look at these 
charges and see them as simple 
coincidence, laziness or a bureau-
cratic hiccup, but the truth is much 
more sinister. When considered 
with the Sixth College Executive 
Committees decision not to solicit 
student input despite strong and 
constant protests, this failure to 
ensure student representation was 
an effort to den aU opposition and 
push the decision through - not 
just a simple misunder~tanding. 
Ask any student representative 
from Sixth College, and you'll hear 
more of the same: that the univer-
sity was "trying to keep the protests 
quiet," and that "students weren't 
even supposed to find out about 
this until the 
summer 

brealc." Which makes it all the 
more admirable that our outgoing 
A.S. Council has done exacdy the 
opposite and thrown the debate 
wide open, catching administrators 
with their collective pants down. 

Scandals over the naming of 
UCSD's colleges are nothing new: 
During the naming of what is now 
Thurgood Marshall College, stu-
dents and administrators were in 
constant spats over whether or not 
the college should be named in 
honor of Patrice Lumumba and 
Emiliano Zapata, in keeping with 
the colleges theme of promoting 
awareness and diversity. Finally, 
all parties managed to agree on 

" Atkinson ... 
contributed to 

UCSD while serving 
as UCSD chancellor 
and UC president. 
But this is reason 

to name a building 
after him, not a 

coUege. 

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., as a 
namesake for the college, but the 
King estate absolutely would not 
allow use of the name due to the 
UCSD administration's long and 
varied history of squashing student 
protests. So another, less interest-
ing minority figure was chosen, 
and Marshall College was named . 

But what makes the present 
case more interesting is the fact 
that Sixth College'S name is being 
pushed through so fast; if it really 
does become "Atkinson College" 
in the fall, it will be only second 
to Revelle College as the fastest-

named school at UCSD. 
The despicable process 

of naming aside, are the 
student protests over 

the name of Sixth 
College valid? After 

all, Atkinson was 
a key figure in 
the University of 
California until 
a few years back, 
and his member-
ship in various 

national 

Eugene Wu/Cuo,dion 

science committees shows he at 
least knows a bit about the "tech-
nology" tenn in Sixth College's 
stated theme of "Culture, Art and 
Technology. " 

But aSK any Sixth College 
student and you'll hear a differ-
ent story, for by and large they 
are studying Culture, Art, and 
Technology for quite a different 
reason than Atkinson and have 
much loftier goals than to be 
bureaucrats running a college. Like 
John Muir College students who 
can lOOK up to the rugged indi-
vidualism of the man who saved 
Yosemite, or Eleanor Roosevelt 
College students who can look 
up to the woman who revolution-
ized politics and compassion, Sixth 
College students deserve an artist 
and an innovator worthy of them. 
Somebody like George Lucas. or 
Leonardo Da Vinci, or any of the 
thousands of artists throughout 
history who have pushed the limit 
of technology through their artistic 
attempts. Hell, even "Carrot Top 
College" is a more appropriate fit 
than "Richard Atlcinson College," 
for at least Carrot Top invented a 
thing or two before his inevitable 
decline into loneliness and AT&T 
commercials. 

So, if Atkinson is such a poor 
fit as a namesake for Sixth College, 
why was he chosen? The official 
press release from Sixth College 
gives plenty of excuses, but the 
real reason Atkinson was chosen 
is that, in his day, he contrib-
uted to UCSD while serving as 
UCSD chancellor and UC presi -
dent. But this is a reason to name 
a building after him, not a col-
lege. UCSD's first chancellors -
Herbert F. York, John S. Galbraith 
and William]. McGill - all have 
buildings bearing their names, not 
colleges named after them. A more 
recent example is Irwin Jacobs, 
president of San Diego technol-
ogy leader Qualcomm, who has 
his name on several bui ldings and 
facilities due to his unyielding sup-
port ofUCSD's growth. To be fair, 
Mr. Jacobs also has a "college" 
named after him, Jacobs .School of 
Engineering, but as an engineer 
and leader in mobile technology, 
at least he is better to lOOK up to 
than a School administrator. Also, 
he paid for the school. 

It is because of these grave stu-
dent doubts over the validity of 
an "Atkinson College" that school 
officials forced the decision through 
in their own sneaky way. Students 
have valid concerns as a result, 
and it is extremely admirable that 
our student representatives on the 
A.S. Council took the initiative to 

step in to try to halt this rail-
roading ofUCSDs "future 

heritage." It remains to 
be seen whose efforts 
will be successful, for 

school administrators 
have a lor of UCSD's 

past heritage on their 
si de. The takeover of 

RIMAC (a student-ini-
tiated and student-paid 

endeavor with no student rep-
resentation), the takeover of the 

student co-op businesses, the nam-
ing of Thurgood Marshall College, 
the loss of student parking - all 
are past examples of student rep-
resentation being manipulated or 
stamped out for political reasons. 

Maybe this time will be differ-
ent, or maybe not. But at least the 
die has been cast, and the battle 
over the future of Si"th College 
has begun.

We are nothing more 
than our top iPod tunes 
Indecent 
Exposure 
Marianne Madden 

I f we believe America's news-papers, it has recendy become trendy to analyze people's 
personalities based on the music 
on their iPods. It all began when 
someone analyzed the top iPod 
tunes of the president, Michael 
Moore and New England Patriots 
quarterback Tom Brady (who, in a 
fit of technological savvy, posted his 
playlist online). 

Not surprisingly, the publicized 
top tunes of these famous people 
are, well, not surprising. Michael 
Moore rocks out to the angry anti-
Vietnam War anthem "Fortunate 
Son" by John Fogerty and Bruce 
Springsteen's version of Bob Dylan's 
"Chimes of Freedom." Tom Brady 
favors pop and rock, his playlist 
crowned by Aerosmith and Eminem. 
The president'S iPod is loaded 
with only 250 runes, a number the 
Nw York 'Timer called "paltry," and 
includes a lot of country and classic 
rock that our parents probably listen 
to - "Boomer rock 'n' roll," the 
Tmttr calls it - and that his personal 
aide, Blake Gottesman, professes ro

yet introspective and sensitive. 
Possesses a vocabulary more suited 
to a ship than a university. 

8. "Seventeen Years," Ratatat: 
Mildly retarded; antisocial. Prone 
to bopping. 

9. "Star Guitar," Chemical 
Brothers: Spastic and antisocial. 
Most lik.ely incapable of ever lov-
ing. 

10. "With or Without You," 
U2: Very fond of juicy guitar riffs, 
Irishmen and pie. Possibly lonely 
and/or suicidal- see No.3. 

11. "Portions for Foxes," Rilo 
Kiley: Sometimes makes rolling 
stops at stop signs. 

12 . "Lost Souls Forever," 
Kasabian: Racked by self-doubt, 
especially when ordering food at 
Cotinn. A danger to herself and 
others. 

13 . "Solsbury Hill," Peter 
Gabriel: Anxious, impatient and 
dishonest. 

14. "Slow Hands," Interpol : 
Addicted to pretentious indie rock. 
Oddly alluring when wearing a 
purple spandex bodysuir. 

15 . "I Cry Alone," the Black 
Keys: A crappy lay. 

16. "Title and Registration," 
Death Cab for Cutie: Eats a lot, yet 
doesn 't gain weight.

Godless . Truculent.

player, though.

ready - that he 
loves country and classic-rock runes. 

Stop the presses! 
After a mere iPod gave us such 

insight inro the mind of the leader 
of the free world, I knew I just had to 
try it on myself. I'm no psychologist 
or music critic (nope, you gocta own 
black Converse sneakers to be one 
of those), but I consulted my share 
of psychologists and musicologists 
while preparing and now present 
their notes to you, unabridged, for all 
the world to see. 

Here are my 25 most-played 
tunes, followed by the profound 
psychological feature each tunc 
reveals about me: 

1. "Another Brick in the Wall," 
Pink Floyd: Compulsive, forgetful 
and spastic. Likes being alone. A 
sucker for British accents. 

2. "The Bottle and the Sea," 
Rrandston: Either a budding or a 
recovering alcoholic. 

3. "Walking with a Ghost," 
Tegan and Sara: Distrustful, judg-
mental and mildly superstitious. 
Also, secretive and insecure. Will 
most likely die without amounting 
to anything. 

4. "Most of the Ti me," Bob 
Dylan: Unable to effectively express 
feelings, teach calculus to strangers 
or rappel down the side of a cliff 
without shriclcing. 

5. "Everything She Does is 
Magic," the Police: Extremely nar-
cissistic, a clo et lesbian or both. 

6. "True Faith," New Order: 
Fearful of rejection, disapproval 
and jumping spiders. 

7. "Sex is Personal," the Faint: 
Obnoxious, bawdy and uncouth, 

of big, floppy hair-
dos. 

20. "1020 AM ," Spoon: Possesses 
a very short attention span . Talks 
at inopportune moments. Socially 
awkward, or maybe just shy. 

21 . "Carry On Wayward Son," 
Kansas: Clumsy and cheap. Has 
a bad haircut. Leaves spots when 
cleaning windows. 

22 . "Aida,· Sarah McLachlan : 
Female. Most likdy either men-
struating or ovulating at this very 
moment. Should be kept away from 
credit cards, sharp objects and full-
fat ice cream. 

23 . "Enjoy the Silence," Depeche 
Mode: Left-handed, near-sighted 
and blonde. Will be dead within 
10 years. 

24. "Back in the USSR," the 
Beatles: Irresponsible, snappish and 
curt. Probably a closet Communist 
or Socialist. 

25 . "White Wedding," Billy 
Idol: Vacillates between demanding 
attention and deflecting it. Gives 
lame Christmas presents some-
times. Left pubes on the soap this 
morning. 

Wow
' 

It's truly amazing what 
trained psychologists can tell you 
about yourself. Especially their last 
insight - that was dead-00, guys. 

Honestly, I thought psycholo-
gists outdid themselves when they 
told us our dreams provided insight 
into who we are. But this iPod 
thing - the wonders of science 
never cea e to amaze me.

. R I LETTERS TO THE EDITORS 
Illegal downloads 

devastate songwriters 
Dear Editor: 

As the president of the 
Songwriters Guild of America, I 
would like to respond to the article , 
"Lack of guilt over illegal file-shar-
ing ensures the failure of RlAA 
lawsuits" in the April 21 issue of 
the Gum·dion. 

If an entire generation of stu-
dents has grown up with the idea 
that federal laws don't apply to 
the Internet, there is no better 
way to re-educate them than the 
Recording Industry Association of 
America lawsuits. Federal copy-
right laws exist for a reason . For 
each rich artist you see on MTV 
flaunting a "wristwatch thaI would 
pay for your college tuition," 
there are hundreds of people in 
the music business barely making 
ends meet. 

Songwriters make about d cents 
per song on an album, and if the 
song is co-written with the art-
ist (which most are, nowadays) we 
make two cents. Do the math and 
you will see we are making only 
$20,000 (before taxes) on one mil-
lion sales. The vast majority of 
songwri ters never get a song on a 
million-selling album. Songwriters 
don't tour, sell T-shirts or endorse 
clothing lines. We make our money 
directly from CD sales. So when 
you steal a song off the Internet, 
you might as well be stealing the 
money right out of my pocket. 
Theft is theft, no matter how 
convenient it might be for you. 
Somebody is getting hurt. 

Songwriters have been devas-
tated by illegal downloading. Half 
of us have lost our staff songwriting 
jobs in the last five years . A song-

writer friend of mine , with multiple 
No. I hi ts, is now selling handbags 
in a department store. She didn't 
fa il at her profession; she was put 
out of business by th ieves. 

But the pain doesn't stop there. 
Many recording studios have had 
to close because declining record 
sales have caused cut backs in the 
record-label rosters. This put hun-
dreds of recording engineers out 
of business. My own nephew spent 
his inheritance from his grandfa-
ther to go to audio engineering 
school, only to be unable to find a 
job after graduation because illegal 
downloading had closed so many 
studios. 

ew recording artists have 
little or no chance of getting a 
major record deal anymore because 
the record labels have all merged 
and down sized their rosters in an 
attempt to survive. It is sad to see 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

the next genera tion of recording 
artists giving up and going back 
home to sell insurance instead of 
recordings. 

Producers, studio musicians, 
background singers, arrangers, 
music publishers, artist managers, 
publicists, record-store clerks, A&R 
reps, promoters, clothing designers, 
makeup artists, lighting teclmicians. 
- the entire superstructure that 
props up the artist you see on your 
TV screen is collapsing, one piece 
at a time. This is why the Music 
United Coalition was formed by all 
the major organizations in the music 
business to determine a course of 
action to help save American music. 
Our choice was narrowed by the 
U.S. court system to suing individu-
als. The vote was taken by Music 
United, representing the mfirr music 
business, to begi n the lawsuits. 

The R1AA is leading Ihis effort, 
but make no mistake, they have 
the support of everyone in the 
business. This goes double for the 
"li ttle guys" like the songwriters 
who could never launch thousands 
of federal lawsuits to protect our 
songs on our own. 

So when you receive your sub-
poena, even if you "feel no guilt" as 
your article cla ims, understand that 
you have violated a federal law. You 
have stolen money from real people 
who depended on that income to 
pay for their homes, their medical 
insurance, their children's college 
tuition. You have seriously hurt 
real, ordinary people. If you feel no 
gui lt for stealing from folks, then 
what recourse does the ind ustry 
have but to enforce the law as vig-
orously as possible?

6 THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDA.Y. ArRll Z5. 2005 

William Matthews . Michael Vrable Kevin Lee 

Congratulations to Professor Brad Calder and the UCSD Programming 
Team for their participation in the 2005 ACM-ICPC World Finals. 

1500 Universities from 70 countries joined in the contest, with 3800 teams at 130 
sites competing to soLve computer-programming probLems. This is the worLd's old-
est, largest and most prestigious programming contest. The top 78 teams in the 
worLd advanced to the finals on April 6, 2005, hosted by Shanghai Jiaotong 
University. The event was held at the Pudong Shangri-La Hotel in Shanghai, China. 
UCSD finished 42nd behind 4 other US teams. 

The UCSD Programming Team has been growing and getting tougher for several 
years now and Professor Calder is always on the Lookout for new taLent that wants 
to compete at the very highest Levels. Contact him at caLder@cs.ucsd.edu and join 
the fun. The next UCSD contest is Saturday May 21, 2005.

. Survey: Group blames 
housing, parking for numbers 

continued from page I 
Overall , Leventhal said the com-

mittee is gathering positive data. 
"Our retention rate is great," 

Leventhal said . "Students aren't 
leaving because they're unhappy. 
They're doing well academical-
ly." 

But UCSD's strong focus on aca-
demics may be hurting its reputa-
tion, according to A.S. Presidential 
Chief of Staff Jared Feldman, the 
Revelle College representative 
to the committee. Academics are 
excessively emphasized on cam-
pus, and social and extracurricular 
activities tend to be overlooked, 
he said. 

"It has to do with the incom-
ing student's perception," Feldman 
said. "It looks like UCSD students 
just study all the time." 

While UCSD is known for its 
outstanding academics, student 
complaint topics range from the 
safety on campus to how students 
feel about the way they are treated 
and respected . 

"W e look as good as UC 
Berkel ey and UCLA academically," 
Sixth College Provost and commit-
tee co-chair Gabriele Wienhausen 
said. "But the campus climate 
doesn't look as good." 

is working toward getting students 
excited about sports events, mem-
bers said. 

In addition, Feldman said , 
the school needs to change its 
current approach to athletics. 
Such competitions as the annual 
Unolympics pit colleges against 
each other, instead of against 
other schools. 

"We need to refocus the ener-
gy," Feldman said. "We have col-
leges competing against each other, 
but we need to funnel the energy 
all about UCSD. That's the game: 
UCSD against every!xxly." 

Wienhausen said students also 
feel that it is difficult to come 
together and social ize on campus. 
The reasons are likely a shortage 
of on-campus housing and lack of 
affordable off-campus housing. In 
addition , the scarcity of parking 
spaces at UCSD makes it difficult 
for students to meet and interact on 
campus, she said. 

"People want big events where 
students can socialize and hang 
out," Wienhausen said. "We need 
chance encounters in a new envi-
ronment that's funky and fun. But 
do we have that? No." 

Committee members are also 
working with various student and 
campus organizations to gather 
data. 

Workout

No sweat in the budget department at least.

According to Matt Xavier, com-
mittee member and UCSD alum-
nus, students feel isolated. 

"They don' t feel a sense of 
belonging," he said. "Only 49 per-
cent of students feel attached to 
this campus." 

"We're still doing a lot of inves-

already speaking with student orga-
nizations to find out what we can 
do differently in student life."

we didn't speak the same lanpage;- there

we had to stlnd, for if we had continued

pinch myself in disbelief. It was incredible. 

Once mass ended, we went home to

Pope: New 
pope brings 
life back to 

Rome 
continued [rom page 8 

experience and a feeling that I will 
most likely never be able to fully 
describe. 

Rome quieted down as mo t of 
the pilgrims and media left. Life 
went back to normal , at least as 
normal as it ever is here. A few 
evenings later, Sam and I walked 
through St. Peter's Sq uare. The 
makeshift shrines and memorials 
were sti ll there, along with a small 
gathering of people. Sam pointed 
out that despi te the m edia 's absence 
and the fact that this cqa pter of 
history has closed fo r most of the 
world, for these people and scat-
tered groups everywhere, it isn't 
over. They will continue to come 
to this spo t to light and re light can-
dIes, to read and add letters. One 
day. when I come back to Rome, 
I will be able to show those burnt 
stones to my children ; J will tell 
them that I was here when those 
spots were made and ex plain JUSt 
how significant they are. 

Days passed and the silent blanket 
over Rome was shattered again when 
the new pope was finally elened: 
Pope Benedict XVI - not quite 
the same ring as 101m Paul - but 
all of the Rommi here seemed to be 
excited about him just the same. 

On Apri l 18, my roommates and 
1 watched the start of conclave on 
CNN (our one Engli h channel) in 
ou r apartment. It was very forma I 
and very rigid. We had expected 
the decision to take at leas t two or 
three days. so when we heard the 
bells we were completely confused. 

When the new pope was selected 
and the ballots burned to produce 
the white smoke, all the church 
bells in Rome sounded . The bells 
rang out through the city, in all or 
nearly all o f the 900 or so Roman 
churches: I was on my bunk bed 
when I heard the cacophony. My 
roommates and I flipped on the 
news. saw the shot of San Pietro, 
and scrambled to get our shoes. 
jackets and cameras. T he three 
of us ran out the door and then 
followed the Vatican Wall to the 
already packed piazza. People were 
herding into St. Peter's in droves. 
T hey pushed themselves into the 
square, jumping over gates and 
around pillars. completely ignoring 
the corbillari's lackluster attempts at 
crowd control. 

We pushed our way through 
the labyrinth of people until we 
found a spot within sight of the 
Basilica's main balcony. T he sky 
was a pale blue. with billowing 
light gray clouds peering up from 
the back of the dome. It was sunny 
and started to rain slightl y. I almost 
expected a rainbow. 

Cardinals lined the balconies 
on either side of the main one 
where the head Cardinal came out. 
" Habemus papam! " he shou ted . 
"We have a pope!" Benedict XV] 
emerged. said a few words and then. 
gave his first "Urbi et orbi " ("for 
the city and fo r the world") papal 
blessing. T he whole ceremony 
could not have lasted more than an 
hour. but it was an hour that none 
of us will ever forget.

Polo: Five Tritons light the 
. lamp against UC Irvine 

coneinued from paRe 16 
17, UCSD unleashed its suffocat-
ing defense, highlighted in the 5-2 
triumph over UC Irvine by Foe's 
10 saves between the pipes. The 
defense stepped up again later that 
day when 'it was called upon against 
Cal State Northridge, supplement-
ing a four-goal Triton fourth quar-
ter by holding the Matadors to a 
single point in the 
frame to seal a 7-5 
victory. 

" 

the first three periods against Cal 
State Northridge, the Tritons pulled 
off a comeback win by doubling 
their tally with three more points. 
A Lyman goal late in the period 
sealed the deal for the Tritons, who 
avenged a 10-5 loss at the hands of 
the Matadors on April 2. Clevenger 
earned her second goal of the day 
with 3:24 left to give UCSD the 

lead. 

"This was a good 
day for us; we were 
stingy on defense, 
which allowed us 
to basically do the 
same things we've 
been doing all year 
on offense wi thout 
the pressure of hav-
ing to be down a 
goal," Sanders said. 

UCSD earned 
its biggest upset of 
the year by clos-
ing off all UC 
Irvine 's offensive 

We held them off 
on defense until the 
fourth quarter, and 

tluu's when our 
strong conditioning 

kicked in." 

"We held them 
off on defense 
until the fourth 
quarter, and that's 
when our strong 
conditioning and 
speed kicked in," 
Sanders said. "Cal 
State Northridge is 
a team we haven't 
had success with in 
the past year and 
a half; we lost to 
them three times 
last season, so get-
ting this win will 
build our momen-

outlets, holding the 
Anteaters to their lowest points in 
a game all season. UC Irvine didn't 
get onto the scoreboard until the 
third period; by then, the Tritons 
had put up four goals and would get 
one more while allowing another 
Anteater tally. The game was also 
a showcase of UCSD's depth, as 
five different Tritons contributed 
a goal: Clevenger, Lyman, junior 
driver Flynn LaRochelle, Bajorek 
and Emaus. 

"UC Irvine missed a lot of shots 
and opportunities, but our defense 
had a part in holding them up 
and causing those missed shots , .. 
we definitely kept them off their 
rhythm," Sanders said. 

After scoring only three goals in 

games." 

tum . heading 
into the next few 

Both teams came to an even 2-2 
draw in the first period before the 
Matadors scored in the second frame 
to take a 3 -2 lead going into the half. 
UCSD and Cal State Northridge 
also tallied a goal apiece in the third 
before the Tritons opened up their 
comeback. Clevenger, Lyman and 
Bajorek notched a pair of goals each 
while Emaus earned one. Chari 
Christopher led the Matadors with 
a hat trick, Foe made seven stops in 
the contest, 

With the regular season com-
plete, the Tritons will head up the 
coast to Davis, Calif" to compete 
in the WWPA championships from 
April 29 to May I.

Water polo ends 
season with a win 

By DANIEL DIAl 
Senior Staff Writer 

Despite a 9-4 loss to No. 14 an 
Diego tate in the fourth annual 
Harper Cup on pril 24, the No. 
IS UCSD women's water polo team 
concluded its regular season with 
a big statement, defeating No. 16 
Arizona State, 5-2, in the finale 
at Canyonview Pool on April 25, 
the team's third win over a ranked 
opponent in four games. 

"I think we played better defense 
in the seg>nd match because we 
were more intense ... but it wa n 't 
because of the emotion of it being 
the last game of the season," UCSD 
head coach Larry Sanders said. 
"This is the same strong defense 
we've had all season, only now it's 
more consistent." 

Havi ng tarted the year slug-
gishly, carrying a 3-9 record at one 
point, the Tritons have rallied, post-
ing 10 wins in their last 14 games, 
a streak that has included three 3-1 
tournament finishes, to complete the 
regular season with a 16-16 over-
aU record. UCSD's recent success 
can be credited to an offensive out-
burst led by senior utility Courtney 
Clevenger and senior driver Tobi 
Lyman, who have combined for 55 
goals in the 14-game stretch, a weU 
as a stubborn defense. 

This rejuvenated attack, partIy 
responsible for the win over Arizona 
State, provide momentum for 
the Tritons as they head to the 
Western Water Polo Association 
Championships, hosted by UC 
Davis. With a 7-4 record against 
WWP opponents in 2005, UCSD 
will enter the competition with the 
third seed, while Loyola Marymount 
and UC Davis pick up the first and 
second seeds, respectively. 

Despite having a first- round 
bye, the Tritons will have to 
grapple with a tougher opponent 
- the winner of the six seed-II 
seed match - in the second rolll1d 
than will the second-seeded Aggies. 
Should both teams prevail, it will 
set up a clash in the semifinals 
for the fourth con ecutive sea on. 
UCSD won the last two semifinal 
matche , including a 10-6 triumph 
last season, but the Aggies swept 
the Tritons i.n their two games this 
season, with both wins coming by a 
one-goal margin. 

UCSD secured a win in their 
season finale for the second year in 
a row by clamping down on Arizona 
State's offense in the second half, 
holding them scoreless. Both teams 
netted a goal apiece in the first two 
periods, with Clevenger and fresh-
man 2-meter Judy Emaus scoring 
for UCSD. 

With the defense hutting down 
the Sun Devils' attack, sophomore 
2-meter Britta Nordstrom's goal 
with 4 minutes, 33 seconds left in 

the third period gave UCSD a 3-2 
lead. Lyman and sophomore two-
meter Sarah Bajorek both scored in 
the final quarter to seal the win for 
the Triton . Junior Kaitlin Foe made 
five saves in goal for the Tritons. 

UCSD began the game against 
San Diego State on April 22 with 
the same poise, as Bajorek matched 
Rachel Serna's goal at the 41-sec-
ond mark with a goal of her own, 
leaving the Tritons down by only 
one at the end of the first quarter. 
But the Aztecs pulled away in the 
second period, with ema and Stacy 
Werner earning goals on San Diego 
State's first two pos essions and 
ending the frame with Serna's third 
goal of the contest, to give UCSD a 
five-goal deficit. 

The Aztecs made it S-I before 
the Tritons got back on the score-
board, courtesy of Lyman 's goal 
with 3:30 left in the third quarter. 
After another Aztec goal, San Diego 
State's Becca Ur was called for a 
penalty, giving the Tritons a shot 
that Clevenger easily converted. 

"The first quarter was close, but 
we still weren't being intense on 
defense," Sanders said. "San Diego 
State didn't take advantage of all 
their opportunities in the first quar-
ter, but then they took advantage 
and went ahead." 

UCSD's defense finaUy stepped 
in during the final quarter, hold-
ing the Aztecs scoreless. But the 
offense produced only one point, as 
Clevenger tallied her second goal of 
the game with 5: 19 remaining. 

With a goal and three assists, San 
Diego State's Dominique Delgado 
earned the Most Valuable Player 
award as the Aztecs sealed their 
fourth-consecutive Harper Cup win. 
The Harper Cup is named for cur-
rent UCSD men's water polo head 
coach Denny Harper, who coached 
both Sanders and San Diego State 
women's water polo head coach 
Carin Crawford at UCSD. As head 
coach of the women's team, Harper 
led the Tritons to five national 
championships. 

In other recent action, the 
Tritons made it to the .500 plateau 
on April 17, climbing over two 
ranked tearns, No. 12 UC irvine 
and No. 17 Cal State orthridge, 
to cap off a spotless second day 
and ensure a 3-1 finish at the Long 
Beach State University invitational. 
With their third 3-1 finish in as 
many tournaments, the Tritons 
stood even in the win-loss column 
for the first time in the season with 
a 15-15 record. 

UCSD began the tournament 
on April 16 with an offensive attack 
that put up 20 goals en route to an 
11 -2 win over UC Santa Cruz, fol-
lowed by a 9-7 setback to Pacific for 
a I-I opening day start. On April

Women's crew wins four of six races 
By JESSICA NAGER 

Staff Writer 

With only a few competi-
tions remaining in the season, 
women's crew dominated UC 
Santa Barbara and Chapman 
University in preparation for the 
Western Intercollegiate Rowing 
Association Championships. The 
Triton women won four of the s.ix 
events at Newport Harbor, Calif., 
on April 23. 

The varsity-four boat finished 
first with a time of seven minutes, 
57 seconds. The boat, which had 
undergone lineup revisions, domi-
nated the race from the start, at one 
point reaching a stroke-per-minute 
rating of 41, before dropping to a 
maintenance rating of 32 for the 
majority of the race. The boat was 
composed of juniors Katie Morris 
and Christine King, sophomores 
Helenaz Moteabbed and Megan 
Haden and junior Phoebe Lee as 
coxswab. Second-place Chapman 
finished in S: 19.1, and UC Santa 
Barbara crossed the line at 8:26.1. 

UCSD's lightweight varsity-
four boat also competed in the 
race as a tuneup before the WIRA 
Championships, where they 
will use the same lineup against 

Pacific Lutheran, Santa Clara 
and Colorado. Senior Chileshe 
Mabula was coxswain for the 
boat, which held juniors Melanie 
Kaelberer and Arianna Pilram, 
sophomores Megan Hagquist and 
Irene Iuppa. 

For the varsity-eight boat, 
the Tritons started off strong 
against UC Santa Barbara and 
held on during the beginniQg 
of the race, but were unable to 
match the Gauchos' speed in the 
final stages. Like the varsity-four 
boat, the varsity-eight made some 
changes in their lineup, going 
with seniors Sara Smolley, Anne 
Roddy and Liz Record, juniors 
Meghan Kelly, Can Kuebert, 
Kaelberer and Dannon Hodge, 
sophomore Leah L1ach and 
Pilram as coxswain. The team 
crossed the finish line at 7:59.4, 
nearly 12 seconds behind UC 
Santa Barbara. Chapman did not 
enter a varsity-eight boat in the 
competition. 

The novice team performed 
brilliantly, winning all three races 
it entered. The first novice- eight 
boat finished the course in a time 
of 7:14.0, three seconds before 
second-place finisher UC Santa 
Barbara and a full 45 seconds 

before Chapman. 
The second novice-eight boat 

performed equally well, taking 
first place with a time of 7:37.3, 
finishing nearly six seconds before 
Santa Barbara's squad. Chapman 
did not compete in the event. in 
both novice-eight competitions, 
the squads were able to finish one 
boat length before their nearest 
competition. 

The novice-four boat was able 
to maintain a commanding lead 
and finished the race 15 boat 
lengths ahead of the competition. 
The Tritons crossed the finish 
line at 9:01.4, compared to UC 
Santa Barbara and Chapman, who 
finished the race at 9:45.9 and 
10:14.2, respectively. 

The Tritons will row in nine 
different events at the WIRA 
Championships at Lake Natoma 
in Rancho Cordova, Calif., on 
April 30 and May 1. They will 
compete among 28 other teams as 
they vie for a prestigious regional 
ranking. The Tritons will once 
again tilce key Division IT rivals 
- Humboldt State, Western 
Washington and Seattle Pacific. 
Results from these championships 
have a large bearing on invitations 
to compete at Nationals.
