A.S. councilmembers have 
appointed new officers to fill the 
seats of the commissioners of 
diversity affairs and athletics, as 
well as an interim replacement for 
the vice president external posi-
tion after two resignations and an 
election with no candidates for the 

athletics post left them vacant early 
last year. 

Through an open application 
process, the council appointed Sixth 
College senior Candice Arnwine to 
fill the diversity office and Earl 
Warren College senior Anna Ahlin 
to take over the commissioner of 
athletics post. Warren sophomore 
Samantha Peterson, the former 
administrative liaison for the A.S. 

external committee, is temporarily 
filling the position of fonner Vice 
President External Kevin Mann, 
who resigned on Sept. 29. 

Before the appointments of 
the three officers, A.S. President 
Christopher Sweeten had been 
performing aU of their responsi-
bilities. Although Sweeten had the

Programming office gets funding hike 
By KATE McELHINNEY 

Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council accept-
ed the recommendation of its 
finance committee at its Oct. 
19 meeting, which gave the 
programming office $13,270 
from the General Unallocated 
funds to cover concerts, noon-
ers, T.GJ .O. events, Sun God, 
operating costs and stipends for 
programming staff. 

The proposal drafted by 
Commissoner of Programming 
Eric Morris was initailly 
approved by the finance commit-
tee, according to Sixth College 
Senior Senator Matt Corrales. 

The council addition-
ally approved reallocating the 
$ 18,000 Sun God ticket sale rev-
enues from General Unallocated 
to the programming office's 
2005-06 Budget. These funds 
will go to the office's Sun God 
account to be used for this year's 
Sun God festival. 

"These events cost a lot of 
money is what it comes down 
to," Morris said. "Sun God eats 
up so much, and things like 
band costs, lights and suppLies 

aren't cheap. Technical services 
increased their wages from $14 
to $22 per hour and in order to 
cover this expense we need more 
money. We want to provide 
more events and more frequent 
events but we can 't because we're 
tapped out." 

A.S. Programming receives 
$432,000 per year from the A.S. 
Council's budget to fund events. 
Last year's Sun God cost roughly 
$200,000 and made an $18,000 
profit, Morris said. 

The council 's senators are 
frequently sUPPf)rtive of addi-
tional programming funds and 
the recent approval was proof of 
that support, , according to A.S. 
Vice President of Finance Greg 
Murphy, 

"Most A.S. senators gener-
ally feel that A.S. Programming 
might be the thing that A.S. 
does which most benefits the 
students," Murphy said. 

Part of the $13,270 will go 
toward installing a $150 stipend 
that would allow 10 of Morris' 
programming staff to operate 
UCSD vehicles such as flatbeds 
and SUV's. 

The current situation, where 
only Morris is allowed to drive 

university vehicles, makes pro-
gramming difficult during 
events, he said. 

"£ have to be present at 
the event and can't be driving 
around," Morris said. "Having 
more driver is a necessity." 
Morris said drivers would be 
needed to assist in transport-
ing equipment eluring shows 
and chauffeuring band members 
around San Diego. 

The A.S. Council currently 
has a budget of about $1.3 mil -
lion, including $99,000 that was 
unspent from last year. 

Although A.S. Programming 
is an entity important to cam-
pus life, every organization 
should receive equal trea tment 
when reviewing funding propos-
als, according to A.S. President 
Christopher Sweeten. 

"We try to make sure that we 
treat each organization equally," 
Sweeten said before the proposal 
was passed. "Each add differ-
ent components to campus life, 
and we want to be fair to all of 
them." 

Extra funding is required 
because the programming office

Campus eliminates 
admissions pathway 
UC resolution calls policy 
biased toward San Diego 

UCSD ..... Ul ... Iuu .... ." .... poley 

Source: UCSD Office of AdmiSSions 
By DANIEL EVERS 
Contributing Writer 

UCSD's admissions office has 
eliminated its policy of granting 
extra consideration to San Diego 
and Imperial Counties applicants 
in response to complaints from 
the UC Board of Admissions and 
Relations with School. 

B.O .A.R.S. found that the pol-
icy, which members considered to 
be local favoritism, was inconsis-
tent with criteria outlined in the 
the university'S official admis ion 
policy, "which specifically aims to 
promote geographic diversity in 
the student population." 

In a resolution, the board spoke 
out against UCSD's admi sions 
processes after it became clear that 
the campus, along with UCLA, 
admitted students through poli -
cies inconsistent with those adopt-
ed by the regents, according to 
B.OAR.S. Chair Michael Brown . 

The goal of the decision was to 
create a more level playing field 
for all applicant and encourage 
the growth of admissions from 
all geographic areas, according to 
Brown. 

After legal action challenged 
the local preferences at Cal Poly 
San Luis Obispo, B.O.A. R.S . 
began checking whether any UC 
campuses used similar practices, 
according to Brown. The question 
was first discussed at the January 
2004 B.O .A.R.S. meeting, he said. 

"The question for B.O.A. R.S. to 
consider was whether or not it was 
right for students with tlle sa me 

basic educatiunal h.K ~roullll, .i' 
others to he grnnted prcfercnudl 
treatment in the adllll~~lClII' pro-
cess," Brown said . "\Ve concluded 
that the practices at C ' I) and 

CL were not in line "llh the 
rules for C admission~ . " 

Beginning in 11)99, .S D 
admitted a mall number of tu-
dents each year from an Diego 
and Imperial .ounties u~ing cri-
teria from the Eligibility in the 
Local Context program, a C-
wide initiative that provides admis-
sion to a UC c3mpu to Califomia 
tudents in the top 4 percent 

of their high chool graduating 
class based upon CPA, accord-
ing to Assistant ice Chancellor 
for Admissions and Enrollment 
Services Mae W. Brown. fter 
the regular admission proce was 
complete, C D admissions per-
sonnel would take a second look at 
students not admitted from high 
schools in local counties. 

After first eliminating students 
not eligible for the universit 
based on coursework, adlllis~i()m 
per~onnel then looked at student~ 
in the top 4 percent of their grad -
uating class who met the criteria 
for ELC. If fewer than 4 percent 
were admitted from a San I)iego 
county high school, UC I) admi~­
sions officers would then accept 
additional applicants until that 
percentage was met, according to 
Brown. The practice, while ben-
eficial, had minimal impact in the 
long run , she sa id.

Construction on the campus' 

Faculty Club broke ground on Oct 
lB, marking the start of a $S.3-mil-
lion project to expand the site that 
serves faculty, staff, graduate stu-
dents and those that donate money 
to the university. The additions will 
indude larger dining and courtyard 
areas and an 1,BOO-square-foot 
conference room, according to a 
university press release. 

More than 200 donors contrib-
uted to the $2.3 million in private 
financing, including Audrey Geisel, 
wife of Theodore Geisel, better 
known as author Dr. Seuss, who 
donated $1 million. The remaining 
$3 million of construction costs win 
be funded through campus and 
Faculty Club monies. The univer-
sity expects that the expansion and 
renovation will be completed by 
December 2006. 

National college 
review underway 
The Commission on the Future 

of Higher Education, spearheaded 
by U.S. Department of Education 
Seaetary Margaret Spellings, has 
begun discussing major issues 
Involved in higher education, accord-
Ing to a government press release. 
The commission's first meeting on 
Oct. 17 induded discussions about 
college financing and accessibility. 
When Spellings first announced the 
group's goals last month, she out-
fined several areas in higher educa-
tion that needed improvement 

'50 I ask yoU to focus on four 
key areas in your work: accessibility, 
affordability, accountability and qual-
ity,' she stated in a press release. 

Spellings expects the commis-
Sion to report its findings to her by 
August 2006. 

Researchers find 
new sand origins 
New UCSD research indicates 

that more sand along the Central 
and Southern Califomia coast was 
aeated by coastal bluffs and dills 
than previously believed. 

While geologists have thought 

that sediment from rivers provided 
up to 90 percent of beach sand 
in Califomia, UCSD scientists have 
published research showing that 
about 50 percent of sand comes 
from erosion of coastal bluffs and 
dills. 

Jacobs School of Engineering 
doctoral candidate Adam Young 
used laser-scanning methods to find 
that approximately half of the beach 
sand In the Oceanside Littoral Cell, 
a 50-mile stretch of Califomia coast 
from La Jolla to Dana Point was 
provided by coastal bluffs. 

"INhile keeping in mind that six 
years is only a brief snapshot in the 
life of the Southem Califomia coast-
line, our results call into question 
the conventional wisdom that coast-
al bluffs don't contribute much to 
the beaches: stated Scott Ashford, 
a professor of structural engineering 
at UCSD and Young's faculty advisor, 
in a press release. 

UCSD completes 
clinical drug trials 
Researchers at UCSD School of 

Medicine have completed the sec-
ond dinical trial phase of a drug 
that treats rheumatoid arthritis 
without affecting the immune sys-
tem, according to a university press 
release. 

The new drug, dubbed dnaJ P I, 
counters tissue inflammation 
in patients by working with the 
immune system's T-cells, which 
usually would harm the body's own 
tissues in the disorder. 

--Oral ingestion of UCSD's new 
drug allows the mucosal immune 
system, found in the intestines, to 
direct the body to not attack its own 
tissue. 

for the UCSD Gruwdian! 
Currently, rheumatoid arthritis 

is treated with medications such 
as aspirin. However, such treat-
ments impair the immune sys-
tem's defense against infectious 
diseases, according to Director of 
the Translational Research Unit of 
the Clinical Investigation Institute 
Salvatore Albani. 

'Such drugs ... have potentially 
dangerous side effects and are 
inconvenient to administer,' Albani 
said. 'Our drug leaves the patien(s 
natural immune responses intact. 
This differs profoundly from what is 
currently available to patients.'

I A.S. COUNCIL AT A GLANCE 
A.S. Meeting 19 - Oct. 19 

Public Input 

Revelle College Senior Senator 
Rachel Corell told tile council 
about the successful online chat 
held with Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox, and said that she is planning to 
discuss the possibility of making it 
a monthly event. She asked for the 
council's support in the endeavor as 
well as its help in publicizing the 
event. 

Special Presentations 
Julia Adame, associate director of 

UCSD's Leadership, Engagement, 
Activism and Development pro-
gram, announced an upcoming 
"Leadership for ocial Action" 
con ference on Oct. 29 in Price 
Center. dame thanked A.S. coun-
cilmembers fo r their support of 
L.E.A.D. and described seve ral 
leadership programs planned for 
the year ahead. 

Items of Immediate 
Consideration 
Item A 

The council approved an allo-
t:ation of $500 from General 
U nallocated to sponsor L.E-A.D.'s 
Oct. 29 conference by a 12-5-3 
vote. Several senators expressed res-
ervations about funding the confer-
ence, due to the fact that L.E.A.D. 
is a branch of the student affairs 
office and receives its own funding. 
Tlie council also debated whether 
or not the conference in question 
was truly planned by students, or 
if it was a primarily administrative 
effort. Ultimately, some council-

members cited the philanthropic 
nature of the conference as justifi-
cation for the funding. 

Reports 
President Christopher Sweeten 

Sweeten announced that 
Congress is considering cuts to 
financial aid to students by S 14.5 
billion, and that he is in the process 
of ttying to organize a press c.onfer-
ence for students to band together 
against the potential cuts. 

Old Business 
ItemE 

Revelle College senior Anna 
Ahlin was appointed as the new 
A.S. commissioner of athletics for 
the 2005-06 school year. Ahlin's 
approval was deferred from last 
week's meeting because certain 
senatOrs objected that they had not 
been given a chance to interview 
Ahlin after her nomination. For the 
full story, see page one. 

Items F, G and H 
After being deferred from the last 

meeting, the council passed agenda 
items "F," "G" and "ll," which 
provide fonnal A.S. resolutions in 
o pposition to state Propositions 74, 
75 and 76, respectively. The council 
accepted an intemal comminee's 
recommendation to approve all 
three item, although Item II only 
passed in a 1-0-11 vote, with all but 
T hurgood Marshall Senior Senator 
Kate Pillon abstaining. All three 
items were met with motions asking 
for the full council to reconsider 
them, but were subsequently voted 
down 3-12- 1, allowing the commit-
tee recommendations to stand.

Dining services drafts coffee ... shop plan 
Graduate housing space to be perpetually rent-free 

., 8AII8ARA LEE 
Contributing Writer 

UCSD Housing and Dining 
Services has drafted a preliminary 
agreement allowing the Graduate 
Student Association to operate a 
student-run coffeehouse in the 
new east campus graduate hous-
ing facility without paying rent 
for the retail space, utilities or 
other maintenance cOSts. 

"The; graduate students already 
pay for the construction of the 
building through their rent, so we 
shouldn't be charged any addition-
al costs," said GSA Vice President 
Lnternal Dana Dahlstrom. 

The coffeehouse will be a non-
profit, self-sustaining operation 
run by students and will provide 
a community space for the future 
residents of the housing fac ility, 
Dahlstrom said . 

J l&DS Director Mark P. 
Cunningham initially drafted the 
Memorandum of ndersta nd ing 
for the en te rprise, but worked 
with the GS in the drafting of 
the agreement before it was fina l-
ized by the Office of Student 
Affairs. 

"We all had the sa me goals 
and worked very well together," 
Cunningham stated in an e-mail. 
"I belicve the process went very 
smoothly." 

11& DS made a join t effort with 
the G A and was able to reach a 
mutual agreement that achieved 
the goal of both groups. 

"I was very supportive o f the 
idea and from that point on, it 
was a team effort to come up with 
a program that will be successful," 
Cunningham stated. 

Campus co-ops, such aChe 
Cafe and the General Store, 
sought si milar arrangements last 

yea r, but were unable to reach 
an agreement with the university. 
With negotiations yet to be final -
ized, the co-ops operate under 
a sub-lease give n through the 
A.S Council and the GSA, which 
requires monthly rent. 

"That's why we're negotiating 
a new agreement," said Thurgood 
Marshall College Senior Senator 
and co-op negotiator Kate Pillon . 
"The university doesn 't like the 
[co-op MOlI!, but the co-ops do. 

" The reason that the 
GSA could be able w 

negotiate such a fanwstic 
agreement is because the 
space they're negoriating 
far is under H &D ." 

- Kate Pillon. senior 
senator, Thurgood Marshall 

Conege 

The basic change is that university 
doesn 't want the A.S. Council and 
the GSA to be the intermediary 
because they want a direct lease 
with the co-ops," Pillon said. 

Whereas the draft plan for 
the graduate housing was only 
between the GSA and lI&DS, 
the co-ops agreement would also 
involve the A.S . Council and 
the University Centers Advisory 
Board, Pillon sa id. 

Because of that difference, a 
similar arrangement for the co-
ops is unlikely si nce the situation 
addresses a lease, which requires 

dealing with different parts of the 
university and not just II&DS, 
Pillon said. 

"[The co-op agreementl is not 
an MOU in the regard that an 
MOU is a description of a rela-
tionship," Pillon said. " It's a lease 
that ha ' stipulations that have 
GSA and A.S. Council involve-
ment ll nd that's how the university 
sees it, so that's why they would 
be resistant to having a similar 
agreement. " 

Whi Ie the co-ops have not 
mentioned the recently drafted 
MOU between the GSA and 
II&DS during negotiations, 
introd ucing such a new and dif-
ferent topic could derail the nego-
tiations during its final stages, 
Pillon said . 

" I'd hope that the CO-OP\ 
would be glad to see a parr of the 
university deal with studems this 
way and ' see no reason why the 
co-ops wouldn ' t be provided with 
the sa me agreement," Dahlstrom 
said . " I hope the co-ops will see 
this agreement as a po~itivc (!.!vel-
opmcnt for UCSD students, and 
I hope lhis .Irrangement Will be a 
model for other student-rull busi -
nesses and services at CSIJ." 

Il owcvcr, because the GS.\ 
and the co-ops arc working \\ lth 
different units of thc university, 
it is unkllown whether the co-ops 
will receive a similar arrangement, 
Pillon said. 

"The reason that the GSA 
could be ab le to negotiate such a 
fantastic agreement is because the 
space they're negotiating for is 
under I-I&DS," Pillon said. "We 
aren 't dealing with such a Ilexible 
and open situation ."

WCSC's retreat funding 
is fiscally irresponsible 
I n its second year after enacting a hetty fee ref-erendum, the Warren 

ollege rodent Council 
has the luxury of hindsight. 
But last year's overspend-
ing has produced an over-
zealous reaction, leading to 
a dramatic increase in the 
amount the cowlcil has set 
aside to spend on itself this 
year. 

This past month, WCSC 
allocated $5,000 internally, 
not including Welcome 
Week allocations. In its 
internal budget, the coun-
cil has given itself $3,500 
for retreat funding, totaling 
almost 5 percent of its total 
budget. The retreat itself 
is an off-site, weekend-long 
luxury for council members. 
The Muir College Council 
set aside only $1700 for its 
one-day retreat and leader-
ship conferences. The dis-
parity is painfully obvious. 

The better-safe-than-
sorry justification for the 

spending is a response to 
last year, when the council 
landed over $2,000 in the 
red. But spending 5 percent 
of srodents' money to build 
cohesiveness among COW1-
cilmembers is excessive, to 
say the least. 

Internally, the council 
cannot request more fund-
ing once its budget has 
emp6ed out. Kowever, 
recklessly allocating money 
"just in case" is not fiscal-
ly responsible. Creating a 
general unallocated fund for 
emergencies is a simple and 
frequently used solutIOn. 

In 2004, the council con-
vinced Warren students to 
approve their first activity 
fee, promising them a wide 
variety of new programs and 
services. Though some of the 
promises were fulfilled, oth-
ers, includin~ a college con-
cert in the vern of Muirstock 
or Marshalpalooza, remain 
tabled. The council must 
get its priorities straight. 

Maintenance is needed 
more than Rady School 
L ast November, Rady School of Management Dean 
Robert S. Sullivan said his 
school 's new campus would 
be the "first totally privately 
funded building" at UCSD. 
He spoke premarorely. 

Just last month, the UC 
Board of Regents amended 
the project's budget, pump'-
ing more than $12.5 mil-
lion of university money 
into construction. For the 
regents, the project should 
be a case study in poor 
planning. 

Admlllistrators blame 
the unexpectedly higher 
costs on the aftermath of 
the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks 
and San Diego's housing 
boom. Both factors, how-
ever, were clearly present 
last November, when the 
regents first approved the 
construction. Either they 
were deceived at the time 
about the true cost of the 
campus, or the university's 
planners dropped the ball. 

UCSD has many con-
struction and building 

maintenance priorities, and 
Rady School is certainly not 
among them. With only 
500 students envisioned at 
its peak - that's five years 
from now, at best - the 
school cannot justify an 
invesunent that IS equal to 
the entire amount of state 
money that the University 
of California spends on 
outreach and academic 
preparation programs. 

A report prepared for 
the regents last year warned 
that nearly 60 percent of 
the buildings in the univer-
sity system are approaching 
the end of their useful life. 
Though UCSD is slightly 
better than the average, we 
too face a deferred mainte-
nance crisis. Any extra $12 
million should've been used 
to address these problems 
instead of funding a new 
vanity project. 

While it's too late to 
reverse the funding decision, 
the regents must demand 
that Rady School pay back 
the extra money with future 
private donations.

San Diego and the A.S. Council should 
implement a ranked,choice voting system 

By ALAN KENNY WONG 
Contributing Writer 

Sickened by having to vote for the lesser evil instead of your first choice? Remember "A vote for Nader is a vote for Bush" or "A vote 
for Perot is a vote for Clinton"? 

Ranked-choice voting, commonly known as 
insrant-nmoff voting, would allow voters to rank 

" 

are from the sam~ party, they cannot "steal" each 
other's votes, thus eliminating the need for a pri-
mary and allowing people from other parties to 
cross party lines. 

Of course, there are some weaknesses in this 
refonn measure that still need to be resolved. One 
concern is the confusion it may cause to disadvan-
taged or immigrant voters who may not be able 
to understand the new voting system - ouueach 

their candidates according to prefer-
ence. If no candidate has a majority, 
the candidate with the smallest por-
tion of the votes is eliminated and his 
or her \lotes redisuibuted to voters' 
next preference. The process goes on 
until a single candidate has a majority 
of the votes. 

RCV allows for a majority vote 
without a runoff election, which 
could have consolidated the four 
mayoral elections in San Diego into 
only two, saving taxpayers money 
and time. 

UCSD, whose 
students have been 

known to elect 
members of its A.S. 

efforts would need to be implement-
ed. Another problem is that in systems 
which limit the number of choices a 
voter may makt; - such as that of San 
Francisco, which limits its voters to 
their top three choices - they have 
no more say in the election even if 
they do have fourth or fifth choices, 
creating some concern regarding the 
constitutionality of some people los-
ing their vote. This problem could 
easily be solved by adopting a system 
in which voters are allowed to rank 
all of the candidates instead of just 
the top three. RCV also allows citizens to vote 

for candidates they truly want, 
though the candidates may be less 
likely to win. For example, if one 
voted for Ross Perot and he had 
the sma Ilest portion of the votes he 
would be eliminated and the votes 
redistributed to the voter's second 
choice, which could be George H.W. 
Bush or Bill Clinton. 

Would you like to see majority 
instead of indefinite plurality victo-
ries? Candidates like the Governator 
would have had to gain a majority of 

Council with as 
little as 36 percent 

of t11e votes by 
plurality of less than 

20 percent of the 
entire campus, has 
given up a golden 
opportunity ... " 

RCV was nearly implemented at 
UCSD in 2004, until a flip-flopping 
senate voted to table the issue indefi-
nitely last October, citing concerns 
about its cost. 

UCSD, whose students have been 
known to elect members of its A.S. 
Council with as little as 36 percent 
of the votes by plurality of less than 
20 percent of the entire campus, has 
given up a golden opportunity to 
ensure that the council representa-

the support of California in order to serve as gov-
ernor, ensuring that, indeed , a majority of the state 
supports him. 

tives have at least a majority when 
elected to office and to serve as a medium of change 
for the campus and the entire city of San Diego. 

The advantages of RCV signi6candy outweigh 
the fixable disadvantages. The A.S. Council should 
implement the measure and be a prototype for the 
-rest of San Diego. 

]f used across the state, primaries could be taken 
off the ballot. Imagine all the candidates running

What's the difference between Dog Men and Cat Women? 
Can we handle the truth? And why is my face all scratched up? 

Indecent 
Exposure 
Marianne Madden 

~e you familiar with the feel-ing of claws kneading your ace at seven in the morn-
ing? 

No? 
r wish I wasn 't, either. 
Let me back up a little. You 

know those people who insist that 
cats are sucky pets because they' re 
allegedly aloof, pJ:ivate and low-
maintenance to the point of only 
putting up with you because you 
feed them? 

After having a cat demand my 
attention for the millionth time, I 
feel justified in saying that those 
people are damn dirty liars. Cats -
unless you abuse them - are atten-
tion whores. They will rub against 
your leg when you are toweling off 
after a shower. They will happily 
purr at you as you pee. They will 
jump onto the table in hopes of 
sharing your dinner with you. They 
will meow and claw at the door as 
you try to lie sleepily in bed. And 
if you make the mistake o f actuall y 
le-tting them into your room in the 
morning, God help you. Your face 
is about to get kneaded. 

(Dogs, r imagine, ha ve a simi-
lar attention-getting routine, but 
instead of kneading your face, they 
joyously urinate on you.) 

And you know what else reeks of 
bullshit in the dog-vs.-cat debate? 
It's gendered. (Get ready to unleash 

your estrogen-fueled rage, girls.) 
Men are only too eager to claim 
that they're Dog People; suggest-
'ing to a Dog Man that he pet your 
cat, or get in the room with a cat, 
or even acknowledge that cats have 
any redeeming qualities, is alcin to 
asking him to put on an apron and 
make you a souffle, then give his 
male roommate a hand job. 

And that small percentage of 
men who admit they're cat lovers? 
Bless 'em, but I have yet to find 
one who doesn 't fit the category of 
"alternative," "indie" or "geeley." 
The Cat Guy is the sort of man 
who will come over to fix your 
computer and stays to play. with 
your cat and complain about how 
he hasn t gotten laid in a year. 

Why is that? I think real men 
should go beyond the manic bark-
ing and wet kisses that dogs have to 
offer, and graduate to the nipped 
anldes and neat piles of vomit that 
cats eagerly dole out. But that's 
just me. 

Girls, on the other hand, are 
suckers for cats, especially kit-
tens, and many men look at outed 
Cat Women with disdain. "Oh, 
you're a Cat Person? I could tell," 
Anonymous Male Companion unc-
tu ously opines, as he looks down 
his nose at you while hi Great 
Dane chokes him with its leash and 
humps his leg. To men , dogs are 
like trucks: th e bigger th e better, 
even if the mil eage is poor. Little 
d gs won 't do,- because holding a 
pet is not as manly as havi ng him 
drag you along the street. 

The traditional wisdom is that 
Colts are like women: temperamenta l, 
fill icky, aloof and tempestuous. And 

dogs, 1 suppose, somehow resemble 
men. This makes more sense when r 
realize that both are playful, lovable, 
often coated with a uniform film of 
slobber, in consant need of baths 
and walks, much more agreeable 
after a good neutering and love to 
catch Frisbees in their mouths. 

But, after doing extensive 
research on the subject in my capac-
ity as a cat scientist (i.e., petting 
my roommate's cats while watching 

" To men, dogs are

-Like women, cats occasionally 

develop severe self-esteem issues 
that result in the purchase of shod-
dy breast implants. 

-Both love to sleep in warm 
places, like on top of surge protec-
tors, dryers or on your chest. 

-Like women, cats receive the 
highest praise when waking up 
early to make breakfast for their 
partners. 

- Both species sometimes fall 
for outrageous fashion trends, like 
capri pants or Ugg boots, after 
reading about them in glossy mahra-
zincs and seeing them worn by 
their favorite celebrities. 

- Both enjoy basking underneath 
the car parked in the driveway. 
Males are advised to check the 
wheels before they back our in the 
morning. 

- Blonde cats are the prettiest. 
-Both will ignore expensive and 

compliC"dted toys in favor of empty 
paper bags and toes sticking out 
from under the covers. 

-Both run about $100 at a repu-
table animal shelter, including vac-
cinations and spaying/neutering. 

-Both are fiercely territorial , 
and resent having competi tion for 
attention brought into the home. 

- BOtll throw lip a lot, especially 
after drinking too Illany Appletinis 
at the bar. 

- Both sleep with your best 
friend after dumping you ovc r AOL 
I nstant Messenger. 

- Both come in a variety of 
shapes and patterns, including 
tabby, spotted, marbled, tortoise-
shell , iamese, Persian, longhair, 
ca lico and lazy-but-lovab le rub of 

lard. 
-Both face a confu~ing mix of 

celebration and derision when thev 
di play an ounce of independenc~ 
or assertiveness. 

-Both are loved by crazy littl e 
old ladies, who tend to collect doz-
ens of them and keep them in 
squalor in their small apartments or 
run-down houses. 

-Both will nip your ankle when 
hungry. 

-Both cry at strange timcs, like 
at weddings. 

-Both are fun to watch roll 
around , playing with each other, 
although they arc often secretive 
l bout this behavior and prefer to 
do it in private. 

-Both arc particula rly suscep-
tible to being hit by cars as they 
attempt to cross the treet. 

- Both love to walk across your 
keyboard , then drape themselves 
across your mouse hand. 

- Both ca n rise up on their hind 
legs, using their tails for balance 
and striking toys with both of thei r 
paws. 

-Both hiss and fluff out their fur 
when frightened or provoked. 

-And , last4r, both readily 
scratch their ears with their feet 
and unabashedly lick their hind-
quarters. 

Well , I think we can agree t1l3t 
these revelations are shocking 
indeed . Excuse me, but I'm going 
to dislodge this cat from my face.

"We wanted to make sure that we

for these positions," said Revelle

son selection committee along with

before the year ends that incor-
porates music, culnlral arts, crafts, 
foods, dances, book signings and 
lectures from activists within our 
community" Arnwine said. 

Ahlin expressed similar senti-
ment, explaining that one of her 
primary duties as commissioner of 
athletics will be to bridge the g'JP 
between the UCSD community and 
the intercollegiate athletics depart-
ment, as well as to raise school spirit 
and attend3nce at sporting events.

"Four percent of a high school 

graduating class doesn't amount 
to a very high number," -Brown 
said. "Accordingly, there were 
not that many students admitted 
based on this policy, especially 
when compared to the total num-
ber of students we accept each 
year." 

In 2003, there were 166 stu-
dents accepted based on the poli-
cy out of a total of 1 7,6 18 admits, 
accordi ng to Brown. In 2004, 
the number rose slightly, with 
183 students out of 17,189 being 
accepted due to their geographic 
location. 

B.O.A.R.S. found the pratice 
to be too narrowly tailored to 
meet the goal of promoting geo-
graphic diversity, Brown said. 

"Mter the UC came to its 
decision regarding how to apply 
the geographical diversity criteria

said.

UCLA, also di scon ti nued by

differently but had si milar results, 
according to Brown. 

"At UCLA, the program in 

question was designed to help out 
students from challenged neigh-
borhoods," Brown said. "But due 
to the fnct that CLA only hnd 
information on the neighbor-
hoods of this type that were in 
close proximity to campus, the 
overall effect was the same." 

Il owever, the exact number of 
students admitted under CLA\ 
pol icy is unclca r, as the school 
uses a broader admissions ystem 
that is different from UCSD's 
point-based approach, Brown 
sa id.

All UCSD students were allowed 
to interview for the positions, pub-
lici<:ed to undergraduates through 
e-mails sent out by the council. 
Although Corell said that the turn-
out for the interviews was good, she 
also said that Arnwine and Ahlin 
quickly proved themselves to be 
the frontrunners for their respective 
positions. 

"Candice and Anna were the 
shining stars that stood out from 
the interview process," Corell said. 
"They both had concrete ideas on 
how to improve thei r offices, as well 
as the programming experience we 
were looking for." 

"Triton spirit does exist at 
UCSD," Ahlin said. "The UCSD 
community just does not know·when 
and where to show it. r interviewed 
for this position not because I have 
had a negative experience with the 
athletics department, but because 1 
have ideas on how to make the expe-
riences of the UCSD conununity 
more positive." 

After Mann's resignation, an 
open-interview process was imple-
mented to replace him, but due to 
Peterson's experience with the A.S. 
Council and previous legislative 
experience, she was appointed as a 
"qualified" candidate. Her interim 
tenure as Mann's replacement will 
expire on Oct. 25, but she stated 
that she plans to reapply for the 
position at the end of her tenn. 

Funding: Campus to hold video ... game fest 

Under the constitution, the 
nominations must be presented 
for approval by voting senators. 
Arnwine, questioned before the 
council at the Oct. 12 meeting, was 
approved by consensus. However, 
Ahlin, who was absent from the Oct. 
12 meeting due to prior commit-
ments, was approved on Oct. 19. 

During that meeting, Arnwine 
expressed a desire to unite UCSD 
students of all races, sexual ori-
entations and socioeconomic back-
grounds, as well as interface with 
other universities and local second-
ary schools.

A specific goal that would require 
more funding is increased repu-

achieve citywide through adver-
tising banners across San Diego, 
he said. 

"I think we should all buckle 
down and spend the money we 
have to make it happen," Morris 
said. 

An additional initiative for 
programming is to expand cam-

The event could create morc 
campus unity but would require 
more funding to make it pos-

'Good Night' revives 1V news' lost integrity

familiar? From critics of our current 
administration, maybe? ot quite. 

This line was spoken a half-cen-

Edward R. Murrow, best known as 
the man who brought down the com-

And with broadcast journali m 
today billing Paris Hilton's every 
sneeze as top news, Murrow's leg-
Cl1(iary battle as the subject of "Good 
Night, and Good Luck" is far less 
dusty than it may at first sound. 
"Good ight" opens with Murrow's 
chillingly relevant speech warning of 
the dangers of complacent broadcast 
journalism, then sets out to give a les-
son in ass-whooping reporting from 
an era when the risks weren't much 
different - losing the sponsors, los-
ing your job, losing the audience to 
celebrity talk sbows - but they were 
risks a brave few journalists (and just 
as few heroic bosses) were willing to 
take. And whcn journalists do this, 
history shows it may JUSt change

David Strathairn plays the 
chain-smoking man of integrity like 
nobody's business. By all accounts, 
he looks nothing like the acnlal host 

of CB 's "Sec it Now," but is eerily 
spot-on in manner and speech. Sure, 
his character (or, for that matter, 
any of the others) doesn't seem to 

ha~e much of a life outside the CBS 
offices, but who arc we kidding here 
- they're news journalists. They 
don't have time for that. The camera 
follows Murrow and his gang from 
the hectic office to the corner bar 
and back to the offica, never shooting 
outside (maybe serious journalists 
don't get to see the sky, ei ther). Even 
the film 's soundtrack is in situ, with 
Diane Reeves belting gorgeous jazz 
runes from inside a CBS recording 
studio. But, by some magic, none of 
this gets c1austtophobic. From the 
moment Murrow decides to chal-
lenge McCarthy over the unfair dis-
missal of a pilot from the U.S. Navy 
- the pilot's family allegedly read 
Communist texts, but the proof is 
kept sealed away - the viewer turns 
into one of Murrow's teammates, 
nelVous and excited and tugging at 
the collar of his shirt every time the 
studio's camera starts rolling. 

What a team itis. Rollcall: You've 
got the superb Frank LangeUa as the 
concerned boss. You've got Robert 
Downey, Jr., and Paoicia Clarkson 
as a couple in hiding due to company 
rules that prohibit marriage between 
co-workers. You've got a wrenching 
Ray Wise as a "pinko" hounded to 
suicide by the terror of the times. 
Hell, you've even got Tate Donovan, 
playing, um, some guy in the office 

Courtesy of warner Independent 

SmoIdn': David Strathaim plays the chain-smoking straight-talking lV newsman 
who dared to challenge Sen. Joseph McCarthy's dubious communist-hunring tactics. 
looking pretty serious. [f anything, 
there's too much talent to fit in here. 

For aU the gravity of the film, 
there's humor lurking. Throughout, 
the dry banter between Murrow and 
his producer Fred Friendly (played 
discreetly by Clooney) takes some of 
the edge off their righteous crusade. 
Then there's glimpses of Murrow's 
other show - the fluffier ~Perwn to 
Perwn" - which provides a surreal 
moment in which we watch Murrow 
ask Liberace (played by real footage) 
if he's found anyone special. Answer: 
He hasn't found the right g.al yet. 
Yeah, not Murrow's finest moment, 
but the show put the bread on the 

table, and the film is judicious in not 
turning the man into a saint. 

~Good Night," despite its lengthy 
use of actual footage, is no documen-
tary. Those looking for a refresher 
course on McCarthyism, look else-
where. This is a movie tailor-made 
for all those who have somewhere 
along the way lost faith in journalists 
as watchdogs (yeah, you). But more 
than nostalgia, it's a tale of hope 
- just a little. And above all, thank 
you, Mr. Clooney, for giving jour-
nalism teachers something to spice 
up their curriculum. lnere's only 
so many times one can see "All the 
President's Men."

ZENITH WITH 
WILLFUL 
INSANITY 

BY 
CODY B. 
NABOURS 

The guitars slowly begin to strum, coaxing themselves out of hiding. A mandolin seems 
to arise, only to be pushed aside 
by the rubbery-thick bass guitar. 
Instruments keep coming, adding 
cascading lines that nearly get lost 
in the haze of competing melodies. 
Horns and whispers adorn the fur-
thest reaches while a tambourine 
evolves into a rush of auto-fire 
drums and cymbal wash; then the 
mass of noises rise and climax into 
a dizzying, triumphant mess. With 
post-coital delicacy, all but the beat 
drops away, and the instruments 
slowly return: the bass, the acous-
tics, the backwards guitars, horns 
and finger drums, one after the 
next, and then fade away, as if they 
were merely dreamt. 

The instruments on Broken 
Social Scene's new self-tided 
album don't quite play together, 
but £low into place, mimicking the 
vocals that seem to take ages to 
prop themselves into place. Beauty 
isn't lost in the disorder, but is 

accentuated by it. The barely 
recognizable individuals -

the variously distorted 
guitars, occasional 

strings, styl-

ish horns, harp-lile chimes, mor-
bidly obese bass, whispered chants 
and triumphant screams - rise 
and combine to fonn something 
oppressively majestic, the sonic 
equivalent of an Almighty-led rain 
of boulders from the heavens. 

The 17 (at last count) mem-
bers of Broken Social Scene are 
heroes in their homeland, and for 
good reason. Part music collective, 
part super-group, much of the con-
stantly growing cast is composed of 
already established Toronto musi-
cians (see Metric, Aposde ofHusde, 
Stars, Feist), always ready to lend a 
hand to their town's homegrown 
indie-rock symphony. The name is 
not accidental; when Broken Social 
Scene perfonns, it is as if the entire 
music scene of Toronto is playing 
the same song at once, blasting 
out of every club and dive bar in 
the city. The layers upon layers 
of indisc.riminate guitars and mur-
muring vocals sound organic, like 
each member writing and playing 
on their own as part of a collective. 

The group's third album brings 
to life the collaborative insan-
ity implied by the group's nature. 
There's the echoey Edge imper-
sonator (no doubt with a Bono 

counterpart) , someone playing 
the Stooges' fu zz-stomp, a Joni 
Mitchell-ite (they (we Canadian), a 
wannabe J. Mascis (of '80s alterna-
heroes Dinosaur Jr.), a wannabe 
Springsteen, and more than one of 
the indie-rock type, more interest-
ed in tweaking the feedback drone 
of their Fender amp than shaving 
regularly. The group exists in a 
swirling opaque fog, layering so 
many living instruments above one 
another that they remain unrecog-
nizable and familiar, momentarily 
revealing a wail or a whisper, and 
always swinging to the chameleonic 
beat, which machine-guns along to 
its own (usually) swift mettonome. 
By comparison, 2002's top-notch 
You Ft1rgOt It In People sounds almost 
skeletal. 

Broken Social Scene can eas-
ily exist as a single mood, finnJy 
planted in the intersection between 
overambitious indie-rock and stony 
jamming. The often-vague melo-
dies can transfonn the multifaceted 
playing into a muddled bouquet of 
noise, but as the insistent drum-
ming and fuzzy, flabby bass con-
stantly remind, there are songr on 
this jigsaw masterpiece, and damn 
good ones.

The Mouse and the Mask 
Epitaph/ADA 
............................................. 

His coat is gray. his face metal. He's a rodent by day, villain by night - that is, unless "AdlLlt 
Swim" is on. He's DangcrDoom, 
the much-awaited fusion between 
producer DJ Danger Mouse (fresh 
off the Gorillaz beat machine and 
with the most talked-about remix 
album of 2004 under his belt) and 
masked lyricist MF Doom (following 
up Madvillnirry, a collaboration with 
MadJib that left expectations high, to 
say the least). With a little help from 
Cartoon Network's "Adult Swim" 
characters. the duo's oddbalJ album 
Thf MUllSf tmd the Mask easily stands 
out against the bullets and booties 
that Hood the hip-hop aisle. 

' £nere was bound to be a theme 
here - Doom has tOO many alter 
egos to count, and Danger's mouse 

**** costume is rarely shelved. But for 
The MOllse rnul the Mask. the pair has 
taken the cartoon concept to the next 
level: Meatwad and Master Shake of 
the "Aqua Teen Ilunger Force" spit 
a few rhymes (or beg to), and even 
ever-serious guest Talib Kweli suc-
cumbs to rapping about cereal bowls 
and Saturday morning cartoons. 

Doom's lyrics are mind-blowing 
as usual (who else would rhyme "poo" 
and "igloo"?), and Danger rises (Q the 
challenge by delivering beats among 
his best yet, the samples seemingly 
straight out of a bouncy '70s eartoon. 
Ghostfuce. Cee-Lo and K wcli make 
cameos for some of the most fun hip-
hop in years.

.... .. .......... , .. ....... ....... .......... . 

At first g lance. it ~eems quite unnecessary to praIse yet abram the musica I renovation taking 
place in the "there's-something-in-
the-water" cities of urban Canada. 
Adding to the list of dynamic, 
emotional sounds echoing down 
to the States is Wolf Parade. a 
group of seemingly starved yet dis-
ciplined musicians ready to lear 
through any competing fire or sod-
omjzing film strip in their path. 
ApologitS to the Quem MOl) portrays 
a wide variety of densely struc-
tured tempo and progressions that 
made me howl at the end of every 
short-stricken track. Then again, 
I have faith that Apologies is only 

***~ 
a tease they will wi ftIy surpass 
on the second date. The highlight 
of the album is (quite admirably) 
its entire first half, as each track 
begins with a different instrument 
only to build into 3n eventual 
synthetic explosion of noise and 
thunder by the time of its demise. 

While their country's now-
realized fate of becoming a 
media-frenzied "scene" will 
surely die off, these predators 
should remain fierce enough to 
pass up any hand-fed sc raps in 
anticipation of finer trears ahead.

14 HIATU THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, OCTuBI:R 20,2005 

'North Country' respectfully recalls the beginning of sexual harassment laws 
By CHRlmNE CLARK 

Associate Hiatus Editor 

In the postmodem age where sewal harassment seminars are mandatory for most employees, 
a film like "North Country" might 
seem redundant. However, "Whale 
Rider" director Niki Caro's latest, 
based on true events about sin-
gle mother Josey Aimes (Charlize 
T heron) - who won one of the first 
class-action scxual harassment law-
suits in American history - chang-
es any misconception that sexual 
harassment against women was ever 
a benign problem in the workplace. 
Theron plays her second down-
and-out, working-class woman fol-
lowing her Academy Award-win-
ning portrayal of serial killer Ai leen 

Woemos in "Nlonster." 
The film opens with Aimes left 

bruised and bloodied from a vio-
lent encounter with her deadbeat 
husband: This sums up her charac-
ter throughout the film, roughed-
up but not beaten. Aimes decides 
to leave her husband and return 
to her hometown to live with her 
parents in rural Minnesota. She 
fails to find solace in an unsup-
portive father (Richard Jenkins 
of "Six Feet Under") and passive 
mother (Sissy Spacek) and strug-
gles to find a decent-paying job to 
support her two children. So on 
the recommendation of long-time 
friend (played by the always- bril-
liant Frances McDormand), one of 
the town's few female miners, Aimes 
decides to work at the iron mine 

FISHER 
- - - -

J\\ ['>T~l[l\TS 

- it's the highest-paying job for a 
woman with little education. Caro 
illustrates that the mine is the life 
support of the town's inhabitants 
- including Ajmes' father, who 
reacts to his daughter'S newfound 
career by accusing her of being a 
lesbian. 

But Aimes discovers that her 
father is not the only one who 
discourages women from seeking 
employment in the iron-mining 
industry, where female miners are 
tomlented and degraded on a daily 
basis. Caro redefines the meaning of 
sexual harassment by showing that 
the women miners were not even 
treated like human beings. There are 
many powerful scenes in which male 
co-workers harass Aimes and the 
other females with obscene acts that 

FIND 
....... s 

~ 
DIals 

range from sexually explicit graffiti 
and insults to physical assaults. Caro 
is successful in graphically show-
ing the harassment, bur she handles 
the material in a respectful man-
ner. Unlik.e other films in the past 
that have dealt with similar subjects, 
such as "The Accused" and "Boys 
Don't Cry," she never goes as far as 
portraying women as indefensible 
victims. From the onset, Aimes is 
always fighting back for herself and 
the other females who work in the 
mine. 

Lnspired by watching the Anita 
Hill testimony, Aimes decides to talee 
her employer to court even though 
her lawyer (Woody Harrelson) 
warns her that the mine owners 
will use the "nuts or sluts" defense: 
either she was nuts and imagined 

the harassment, or she was a slut 
who couldn't stop sleeping with her 
married co-workers. 

After her last project, Caro has 
not shied away from making films 
with a feminist message. She eerily 
gives us a glimpse of a time, less 
than 20 years ago, when for many 
women, having to face horrendous 
abuse from their male counterparts 
was aU in a day's work.

Men's soccer: Tritons return 
home after three~game road trip 

continued from page ,6 
leaving them four points beh;nd 
the Tritons with only three games 
left in the regular season. 

The Tritons' upcoming games 
include a possible playoff preview 
between the Tritons and the No. 
10 Toros at Triton Soccer Stadium 
on Oct. 22. This game is a must-
win for the Tritons if they wish to 
maintain their lead in the CCAA 

South Division. After the show-
down against CSUDH, the Tritons 
will travel to San Bernardino to 
face the CoyoteS on Oct. 26. The 
Tritons' regular season finale will 
come at home against Cal State Los 
Angeles on Oct. 29. Once time runs 
out against CSULA, the Tritons 
will focus their attention on the 
upcoming CCAA Championships, 
which begin on Nov. 4.

Soccer: Penalties lead to streak~ending loss 
continued from page 16 

Tritons came out expecting to use 
their normal tactics: early scores 
and defensive stops. However, it 
was Stanislaus that scored first, 
setting the tone and giving the 
Tritons the unfamiliar feeling o~ 
a deficit. 

It was Warriors' freshman 
midfielder Katie Brown who left 
the Tritons trailing with her goal 
in the 38th minute. Sophomore 
midfielder Michelle Couto and 
sophomore forward Cherie Early 
assisted Brown on the score. 

The teams battled evenly until 
the 80th minute, when UCSD 
junior forward Alise Malley 
notched her fifth goal of the sea-
son unassisted. Malley's equalizer 

came with the Tritons playing a 
man short after junior defender 
Allie Avina received a red card. 

The match was filled with 
penalties, with the teams com-
bining for 30 fouls , two yel -
low cards and a red card. Triton 
head coach Brian McManus was 
assessed with a yellow card of 
his own, adding to the Tritons' 
penalty problems. 

The game appeared headed for 
extra frames as time ticked down 
in the last minute of the I - I ti e . 
However, Cal State Stanislaus's 
Marti T eunissen took a pass from 
Grace C ochran with 23 seconds 
remainin g and beat U C SD frt . h-
man goalie Mia Shirley for the 
score and the win . 

The win was huge for the 
Warriors, pushing them into the 
top-H. 

The last-second goal was 
heartbreaking for the Tritons, 
but despite the loss, they are 
still poised for a strong playoff 
performance. Only three regu -
lar season games remain before 
the CCAA Championships from 
Nov. 4 to Nov. 6. 

Before the playoff~ , UCSD 
will face Cal State Dominguez 
Hills at home on Oct. 22 . 

From there, they will depart 
for Sa n Bernardino, to face the 
Coyotes o n Oct. 26. F inally, they 
will cl ose out the regu lar season 
at home agai nst Cal State Los 
Angeles o n O ct. 29.

Foul play: The Tritons' overall record was extended to 20-4 after splitting games 2-2 at the Northern California Open. 

By ANGELA LIN 
Associate Sports Editor 

Coming off a heartbreaking 7-
R overtime loss to Stanford on 
Oct. 15, the o. 6 UCSD men's 
water polo team began Jay two 
of the orthern California Open 
Tournament with a matchup 
agai nst o. 7 UC r rvine, walking 
away with an 11 -10 win. 

The Anteaters came out strong 
in the first quarter, outsCoring the 
Tritons 3-4, but the Tritons cap-
tured the lead before the end of 
the first half, scoring four goals to 
Irvine's two to make the score 7-6 
at intennission. 

The Triton men then repeated 
their performance in the third 
quarter, adding another four goals 
and holding the Anteaters to two 
goals for an 11 -8 lead. 

The Anteaters made a last-
ditch effort in the fourth quarter 
to capture the win, but C3me up 
a goal short, adding two more 
goals to their total and holding the 
Tritons scoreless. 

Nonetheless, the Tritons 
earned an 11 - 10 win in their first 
game against UC [rvine this sea-
on, propelling them to the fifth-

place match of the tournament. 
Senior jonathan Hopkins con-

tributed five goals in the Tritons' 
win, while senior Brandon Borso 
and sophomore Adnan jerkovic 
added two goals apiece. Seniors 
Kevin Smoker and Chris Finegold 
also netted one goal each, while 
senior goalkeeper Colin McElroy 
had seven saves in the win. 

The victory sent the Tritons to 
their fQUJth game of the Northern 
California tournament just three 
hours later. 

The men battled then-No. 7 
Pepperdine for fifth place in the 
16-team tournament, losing 7- 12 
in their worst defeat of the sea-
son. 

The game began evenly 
matched, with each team at three 
goals apiece at the end of the first 
quarter before the Waves opened 
their lead in the second quarter by 
outscoring the Tritons 2-3. 

Pepperdine didn't start pull-
ing away until the fourth quarter, 
when the Waves scored four goals 
to the Tritons' one, making the 
final score 7- 12. 

llopkins scored three goals in 
the win, increasing his season total 
to ·75, while McElroy made njne 
saves to Pepperdine goaLkeeper 
Ben Tait's eight.J erkovic also con-
tributed two more goals, whj Ie 
Borso and senior Chris Eichholz 
added one goal each. 

After Sunday'S split games, 
the Tritons' overa II record was 
extended to 20-4. 

The Tritons will have the 
opportunjty to seek revenge on 
No.5 Pepperdine with a match set 
for Thursday in Malibu, their first 
nontournament matchup. The 
men will follow the Pepperdine 
game with a highly anticipated 
battle the next day against No. 4 
UCLA.

four games before the start of the 
Western Water Polo Association

The No. 9 women's soccer

The No. 21 UCSD men's soccer 
team blanked Cal State Stanislaus 
1-0 on Oct. 16 to complete the 
Tritons' three-game road trip, in 
which they finished 2-\' 

The Tritons (10-3-1 over-
all, 7-3-1 California Collegiate 
Association) came into the match-
after splitting their first two con-
tests on the trip, losing to Cal State 
Bakersfield 2 -Ion Oct. 12 before 
beating Chico State 1-0 in over-
time on Oct. 14. 

The shutout victory over the 
Warriors was the Tritons' second-
straight victory and eighth over-
all. The Triton defense has been 
spectacular this year, keeping up 
in games even when the offensive 
unit is subpar. The defense, led 
by the five shutouts from senior 
goalkeeper Edward Ruhland, has 
only allowed seven goals through 
fourteen games, an incredible 0.5 
goals per game average. 

With an average like that, the 
Tritons should need only a goal a 
game to keep on winning and to 

close out the regular season. The 
team got the one goal needed in 
the 18th minute, off the golden 
foot of sophomore rnidfielder Pat 
Kelly. Kelly's second goal of the 
year came off a feed from junior 
midfielder Chase Douglas and gave 
the Tritons an early 1-0 lead. 

With sparkling defense expect-
ed now, it was no shock to see the 
Tritons shut down any Warrior 
attack. Ruhland notched only three 
saves in the game beC3use the 
defense in front of him allowed 
only seven shots all game. While 
the Warrior offense was faltering, 
the Triton offense took 11 shots, 
but needed only Kelly's shot for 
the victory. 

This victory was very significant 
for the Tritons' playoff hopes, as 
it moves them into first place in 
the CCAA South Division with 22 
points. The team passed then-No.4 
Cal State Dominguez Hills thanks 
to the combination of a UCSD win 
and the Toros' 6-0 loss at Sonoma 
State on Oct. 16. With the loss, the 
Toros,faU to a 6-2-2 CCAA record,

Call me a food snob, but I find that much of the food that ends up on the American 
plate these days is a pathetic fac-
simile of itself. It is generic and 
noncommittal - not a biscuit, but 
a pale, uninspired imitation of a 
biscuit; not truly sinful chocolate 
cake, but brown spongy stuff with 
too much hydrogenated oil. And 
tragically enough, people pay good 
money for this kind of food .

slapped me in the face and showed 
me the light again: a crust that's a

a subtle, fresh-tasting sauce; the 
wonderful millc.y taste of whole-

actually taste good. Try the pesto,

A heach virrually unk"TIown to most tourists - witll the exception of real surfers

the perfect San Diego coastline for 
anyone trying to avoid crowds for a

While the two-mile stretch is

summer, winter weather attractS 
mostly surfers who come for the 
large swells found nowhere else. 

Within walking distance, stu-

due to its secluded location ncarl\, 
300 feet below the paraglide pori: 
adjacent to Torrey Pines State

Beach is not for the fuint of heart. 

TIlese conditions, though, only

F or every cheap taco shop in San Diego, there's at least one overpriced sushi 
restaurant next door. But sushi 
snobs know the truth : While a 
burrito guarantees greasy good-
ness, excellent sushi is an art 
form that few have perfected. 

Sushi Itto, with locations 
downtown and in Hillcrest, is a 
place where high-quality sushj 
basics are transformed under 
the hands of creative chefs into 
bizarre and wonderful taste 
experiences. 

Their extensive list of spe-
cialty rolls is admittedly more 
Californian than Japanese, 
sporting eclectic-ingredient 
offerings like the ".com Roll ," 
the "Cone-Head" and the "All 
Star." A waitress-recommended 
favorite, "Hooky at the Beach," 
is a heaven where shrimp go 
after they've been breaded, fried 
and slathered in cream cheese 
and avocado. 

A lower-priced, conveniently 
located option is Yummy Makj 
Yummy Box, on Holiday Court 
next to the La Jolla Village 
Center. 

It's a brightly lit, plastic chair 
joint with adult soft rock playing 
in the background, but the food 
tastes great. 

Fina lly, the best sushi deal 
in town has to be Ichiban's on 
University Aven ue in Hillcrest, 
where half-off an impressive 
selection of already cheap rolls 
Monday through Thursday from 
3 p.m. until 7 p.m. guarantees 
long, sociable lines. 

The initial wait is offset by 
the speed of service, and patrons 
are guaranteed to walk out 
stuffed like a California Roll for 
under $10.

where - v.ith aver 130 beers - you are guaranteed to satisfy all your alrohol needs. 

F or the beer lovers out there, I'm not sure that anyone can argue that Yard House 
isn't the best place around to grab 
a tall, frosty pint of your favorite 
brew. Boasting the world's larg-
est selection of drah beers (they 
average between 130 and 250 
beers on tap at each location!), 
Yard House is also a fantastic 
place to sample new brews and 
maybe even discover a new favor-

ite. Ask the friendly bartenders 
and they'll be more than happy 
to recommend one that suits your 
taste. 

For those who have yet to 
experience a night at Yard House, 
let me tell you a bit about what 
you're missing: As you walk in, 
you'll hear classic rock, rap and 
hip-hop pumping on a state-of-
the-a rt sound system, and you 
can watch your favorite sports

TVs. If you're lhere for a meal , 
you can order deliciou food from 
their lunch , dinner or late-night 
menu; ask the waiter which of 
their beers goes best with your 
meal. 

While Yard [louse has all the 
burgers, pizza and French fries 
you traditionally associate with 
beer, it also serve elegant dishes, 
such as pan-seared ahi or teri -
yakj rib-eye steak, perfect for a 
night out or a fancy occasion. 
And it prides itself on convinc-
ing customers that beer can go 
with any meal, on any occasion. 
You can order beer by the pint, 
half-yard or yard, which arc the 
specialty glasses after which the 
bar is named. A "yard" is 36 inch-
es ta ll, so make sure you've got 
someone driving you home if you 
order one. T here is a club down-
stairs, but it opens late and you

if you're there, you might as well 
let the atmosphere fill your senses, 
join in the fun , and have a beer!

E xtraordinary Desserts has a reputation far larger than its doors. Bea(:ause of that, 
standing in line is inevitable, but 
worth the time if one has the pocket 
for it, as prices here are comparable 
to the pricey Cheesecake Factory. 
However, money spent here seems 
much more reasonable consider-
ing that this local shop was created 
by Karen Krasne of San Diego, a 
Cordon Bleu-trained pastry chef 
of international renown. 

While the building itself is 
more akin to a coffee shop in size, 
it is acruaUy the setting, in addi-
tion to the cuisine, that makes 
Extraordinary Desserts a hot spot 
with sweet-toothed crowds. Relics 
from Krasne's Life spent abroad, 
fanciful plant pressings on the 
walls, candles at every table and a 
simple glass counter for the display 
of artfully decorated cakes provide 
for a largely romantic atmosphere. 

It is a good idea to have a crude 
concept of the menu while waiting 
in line, as large crowds make it 
fairly difficult to see the cakes on 
display. For thc. same rea on , you

may be asked to step aside if inde-
cisiveness strikes when it's your 
turn to place an order. 

Due to small table sizes and 
sheer strength in numbers of 
patrons, this may not be the best 
placc for those who chcrish pri-
vacy and ilcncc, as most tablcs 
arc actually located alongsidc thc 

swarming line and there is little 
ability to avoid being in the thick 
of things. • 

But for those who appreciate 
uniqueness and world-class treats, 
Extraordinary Desserts is an expe-
rience difficult to pass up.

throughout San Diego as one of 
the best breakfast places around. 
The cafe, as the name suggests, 
specializes in omelets. It has a 
huge selection and caters to almost 
every taste, but if you cannot find 
omething with the perfect ingre-

dient combination, you can create 
your own. Food is served with a

variety of sides, including great 
home fries and muffins; there are 
healthy options like fresh fruit as 
well. For those who have a huge 
appetite, Broken Yolk has a mara-
thon plate, which is a heaping 
cocktail tray of food. If you can 
finish all the food, not only do 
you get $15 off the price, but you 
also get a plaque on the waH. A 
warning for those whose eyes are 
bigger than their stomachs: Many 

have tried to finish, but few have 
accomplished the feat. 

H omelets are not your favorite, 
the menu boasts many other break-
fast choices, including pancakes 
(the chocolate chip and banana 
ones are to die for) and waffles. 
The huge portions and quality 
food have kept people coming back 
weekend after weekend.
