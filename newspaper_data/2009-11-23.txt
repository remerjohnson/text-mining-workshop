New Center Houses Sustainability Efforts   
By Kelly Pleskot
Staff Writer

The new Sustainability 
Resource Center — designed to 
encourage and unite environ-
mental initiatives on campus — 
debuted Nov. 20 in Price Center. 

“The main goal [of the SRC] 
is to centralize sustainability 
efforts,” Student Sustainability 
Collective cofounder Fran 
Avendaño said. “It’s a one-shop 

stop for sustainability.”
The administration for 

Campus Sustainability is fund-
ing the rent and upkeep of the 
building. The center draws 
additional funding from a $2.34 
quarterly student fee, approved 
by voters on last winter’s A.S. 
special-election ballot. Fee prof-
its have contributed to the cost 
of the building, and feed into 
the Green Initiative Fund. Part 
of the fund goes toward pay-

ing the salaries of the center’s 
directors. TGIF will also offer 
$80,000 per year to students 
who want to create their own 
environment projects.

“It’s really taking students’ 
money and giving it back to 
them to promote sustainability 
on campus,” Elizabeth Elman, 
one of six SSC directors, said.

A.S. councilmembers are working 
to revise university policy to make the 
use of sports facilities free for student 
groups or organizations looking to 
rent out space for activities. A com-
mittee chartered in 2008-09 to solve 
the issue of double-charging (because 
students already pay a Recreation 
Fee on their quarterly bill) has since 
been disbanded, but the A.S. Council 
is still pushing to eliminate excess 
student costs. 

A.S. Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Peter Benesch explained 
that students paying to reserve cam-
pus facilities for events are essentially 
paying twice. 

“Sports facilities such as RIMAC 
are built through student-referendum 
fees, but students still need to reserve 
space and pay each time to use them, 
which is double-charging,” Benesch 
said. 

According to Benesch, double-
charging has been a problem since 
at least 1995, when many sports 
facilities were first built. 

Last year, councilmembers char-
tered a committee with the purpose 
of revising the university’s policy to 
charge student groups for facility use.

“We wanted to explore different 
policies of usage in terms of student 
fees funding facilities, and we wanted 
to change them,” Benesch said.

The committee has since been dis-
banded — partly because the major-
ity of its members graduated, and 
partly because A.S. President Utsav 

Councilmembers 
attempt to make
athletic facilities free
for student groups.

Hundreds of students gathered for a two-pronged Nov. 21 protest against the recent passage of the 2010-11 UC 
student-fee increases. One group held a candle-
light vigil for the “death of public education” 
and the other staged a traffic-blocking march in 
front of the Gilman parking structure.

The protests came on the heels of last week’s 
UC Board of Regents meeting, where thousands 
of students, faculty and staff converged at the 
UCLA campus to voice their concerns over ris-

ing student fees. 
On Nov. 19, the regents decided to raise 

undergraduate tuition $585 for Winter Quarter 
2010, then raise it another $1,334 by the start of 
the 2010-11 school year. All told, the 32 percent 
increase will raise student fees to $10,302 a year.

Those organizing the “1, 2, 3 Red Light!” 
protest at the campus intersection originally 
hoped to block La Jolla Village Dr. traffic,

LIGHTS AND SIRENS

but relocated to the Gilman Parking 
Structure due to a smaller-than-
expected turnout. 

The vigil, according to attendee 
and assistant professor Sarah Clarke 
Kaplan, afforded students a chance 
to channel their frustration over the 
UCLA protest’s lack of results, and 
at the same time commit to future 
action such as lobbying legislators for 
increased state funding.

“The students that came back 
from UCLA were exhausted,” Kaplan 
said. “They were devastated by the 
decision, they were angry, they were 

tired, and I think that this is an 
opportunity for them to spiritually 
and politically recharge — to have a 
sense of the community that’s behind 
them.”

The candlelight vigil and Gilman 
Dr. protest coincided with protests 
on other UC campuses, including a 
demonstration at UC Berkeley that 
turned violent Friday evening: UC 
Police made 41 arrests following a 
sit-in at Wheeler Hall, and several 
bystanders released self-shot footage 
of officers striking student protesters 
who gathered outside.

However, UC Berkeley officials 

insist that the demonstration necessi-
tated a police presence, and have not 
yet addressed student accusations of 
police brutality.

“The Wheeler Hall protest ended 
peacefully this evening,” UC Berkeley 
Chancellor Robert J. Birgeneau said 
in a campuswide e-mail on Saturday. 
“It is truly regrettable, however, that 
a few members of our campus com-
munity may have found themselves 
in conflict with law-enforcement offi-
cers.”

Students gathered by the hundreds to mourn the “death of public education” and the passing of the 32-percent student-fee increase. “Yelling at [the regents] 
isn’t going to create this change that we need,” protest organizer Sam Jung said when asked about the choice to hold a candlelight vigil instead of a march.

When Time Warner Cable decides to throw me a bone and gives me an 
Internet signal in my off-campus 
abode, my fingertips celebrate by 
hammering out my dirtiest little 
techno-obsession. And I don’t mean 
porn.

I’m talking about www.theforce.net. 
No, it’s not a Web site designed 

to help you with physics homework. 
It’s all about the Force: The one 
that allowed Darth Vader to choke 
inept stormtroopers with one pinch 
of his thumb and forefinger, and 
empowered Yoda to levitate Luke’s 
X-wing after it sank to the bottom of 
the Dagobah-system swamp. 

Displaying expert “Star Wars” 
knowledge at 21 may not be radical 
enough to fall under the category 
of social suicide, but it does tend to 
draw a raised eyebrow or two from 
onlookers. And no matter how many 
friends allegedly love me for who I 
am, not one will support nor seek 
to understand my ability to list all 
the droids from the original trilogy 
by name and function. C-3PO, 
for instance — protocol droid, 
fluent in over 6 million forms of 
communication. 

Sure, my “Star Wars” obsession 
was cute when I was 9 years old, 
collecting Pepsi cans plastered with 
Boba Fett’s image (aww, remember 
the re-release promos?). A few years 
later, though, I have to satiate my 
obsession behind closed doors, where 
no one but me and other anonymous 
Han Solo fanatics log into Jedi 
Council forums and chat live about 
backstage secrets of the asteroid field 
scene in “Episode V”.

All I have to do is Google “Boba 
Fett forums” and I’m assured that 
thousands of other excited fans like 
me have never quite grown out of 
the trend. The anonymity of fan 
sites makes them that much more 
inviting: any overzealous follower can 
create a user name unrelated to her 
real identity. That way, we can delve 
into heated debates on whether Jodie 
Foster should have played Princess 
Leia without public scrutiny — not 
that I do that, or anything.

But really, surfing your choice 
online forum with the blinds closed 
in your bedroom can be the only 
healthy way of dealing with your 
addiction. Looking up Lucasfilm 
terminology in Wookieepedia by 
day and hitting up the pubs with 
your friends by night is probably the 
nearest you’ll come toward double-
life status, making your fan-site 
fascination comparable to a forbidden 
lover you’re forced to see only in the 
confines of a locked room.

There are of course, different 
levels of fandom, and it’s up to you 
to tap the brake wherever you’re 
comfortable. For me, behind-the-
scenes tidbits, film analysis and talk 
of future projects are enough to keep 
me drooling; for others, there exists 
no prospect more titillating than a 
Friday night date with LeiaLover90, 
courtesy of the site’s fan-dating 
service. 

There are no boundaries online,

ON CAMPUS  — The Sustainability Resource Center 
opened its freshly painted doors on Friday to announce 
a mountain of show-stopping green initiatives. Funded 
in part by a $2.34 quarterly fee tacked onto the A.S. 
Council’s Winter Quarter 2009 activity-fee referendum, 
the center has the potential to do big things for UCSD’s 
undergraduate momentum, but without proper execu-
tion, it could easily end up a decadent tribute to our high 
sustainability marks.

One of the main purposes of the green (yes, they 
painted the walls green) new Price Center space is to 
centralize existing student sustainability operations — 

yet an existing space could easily have served the same 
purpose. The makeover is exciting, but not necessary to 
this cause. Most other special-interest clubs rent out dif-
ferent on-campus locations, such as empty classrooms or 
conference rooms, for their meetings. Utilizing existing 
meeting spaces for a revamped initiative — despite the 
widely touted eco-friendliness of the new decor — would 
be even more sustainable. After all, you can’t get much 
greener than using what you already have — especially 
when a brand new Price Center East is right next door,

With a media storm befitting another Jolie-Pitt adoption, one-time Republican vice presidential hopeful Sarah Palin thrust herself back into the limelight last 
week after months of Alaskan solitude. Palin released Going Rogue, a new tell-all autobiography that zipped straight to the top of the bestseller charts. But 
what will be the lasting effects of the new Palin frenzy?

With the release of her new autobiog-raphy and the kickoff of her cross-
country press tour, many are hinting that 
Palin is aiming for the White House come 
2012 — but the hockey mom’s primetime 
second episode doesn’t signify much more 
than an international hunger for some fresh 
Palin gossip.

Admit it: We all find the Palin buzz 
amusing at the least. Vanity Fair even 
dubbed Palin the “American Gossip Girl.” 
Because of the publicity she received during 
last year’s election, many Americans still 
follow Palin’s story with great interest.

But will all the hungry eyes turn to 
votes in three years? A CBS poll released 
last Monday found that 66 percent of 
Americans don’t think Palin should even 
try at the oval office — and, in the end, 
it’s doubtful that a country still YouTubing 
Tina Fey’s Palin impersonations will 
elect the “pit bull with lipstick” to run 
Washington.

— Arik Buravoksy
Staff Writer

The Palin publicity blitz of the past week has been an exercise in excuses. 
That infamous CBS interview? Katie 

Couric’s fault. Her disastrous debate skills? 
Palin blame the guy who wrote the note 
cards. 

After all the controversy over her rather 
pricey campaign wardrobe, Palin sobbed 
that she didn’t even pick out her own 
clothes — every day, a stylist would lay 
out new designer duds (Palin just had to 
point).

In fact, by her accounts, the one-time 
governor of Alaska has just about everyone 
to blame but herself.

But it’s time for her to wake up, smell 
the fresh Alaskan/Russian air and realize 
that without all those people who allegedly 
set out to make her a televised tragedy, she 
would still be shooting moose from a heli-
copter. So, please, Palin — stop blaming 
everyone else and try proving you’re not 
just an angry opportunist.

— Cheryl Hori
Associate Opinion Editor

I f a week’s worth of unprecedented media coverage (the Associated Press alone dedi-
cated 11 employees to fact-checking the Palin 
autobiography — turns out she’s stayed in “robe 
and slippers” hotels on Alaska’s dime, after all) 
has reminded us of anything about the hockey 
mom, it’s that she’s endlessly captivating.

What other failed vice-presidential con-
tender can not only claim a spot on Oprah 
Winfrey’s coveted couch 12 months after the 
fact, but also draws more viewers than the 
talk show’s seen in two years? John Edwards  
might have a love child and a strong jaw on 
his side, but even he can’t come close to rival-
ing Palin’s star power.

The fact that the former governor has 
amassed a following of those who both loathe 
and love her speaks to just how craftily she’s 
shaped her image. No amount of televised 
flub-ups will make us any less mesmerized by 
the former governor — because in the end, 
we the captive audience are the reason for 
this whole media circus.

Dear Editor,
While I give my wholehearted 

support to my fellow students pro-
testing the UC Regents increasing 
our fees without giving a damn 
about our opinions, I only agree 
with protesting the regents’ callous-
ness, not the fee increases them-
selves. The regents have definitely 
turned to student fee increases 
without fairly considering the alter-
natives, but the real battle is over 
state funding.

I’ve heard many people talk 
about lobbying the government 
to fix the broken system and 
increase higher-education funding. 
Inevitably, what the government 
does is take money from the citizen 
and distribute that money however 
it sees fit. So why don’t we just cut 
the government out of the equation 
and go directly to our communities?

We need a massive public rela-
tions campaign to show the cities of 
each UC campus and this state how 
they benefit from us, and not just 
stop there and pray for favorable 
votes. We should create our own 
nonprofit organization to collect 
donations from the community to 
cover fee increases for those of us in 
danger of not being able to pay the 
new rate — people who aren’t rich 

enough for out-of-pocket payments 
or not “poor” enough to get need-
based aid — because that’s who suf-
fers most.

If half of San Diego’s adult popu-
lation donated 50 cents annually, 
that would be around $550,000 
every year (for chump change!). By 
no means would it cover everyone, 
but it’s worth it for just one more 
student who can continue calling 
UCSD his or her home. Of course, 
this isn’t a panacea: We still need to 
fight to stop the UC system from 
degrading our education while 
increasing fees, or else people won’t 
want to call UCSD their home, but 
it’s an idea.

For the record, I wouldn’t benefit 
from the program I propose. I’m 
too poor for fees to affect me (yet). 
I just want to help my peers who 
will suffer.

time for an intervention if any junkie 
becomes certain that the Force is real 
and that the Millennium Falcon is, in 
fact, hurtling through the galaxy as 
we slump over a stool in Price Center

Go ahead: Stop trying to repress 

your adoration for fantastic fictional 
worlds and visit your online fan 
site of choice instead of Facebook

without compromising the social life 
you’ve worked so hard to build and 
maintain — and hey, you never know

those dust bunnied movie posters in 
your closet will live on as treasured

Until then, snap on your seatbelt

On Nov. 9, Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger signed SBX7-
1 into legislation as part of his 
Comprehensive Water Plan to 
increase water sustainability. UCSD, 
as well, has already taken steps toward 
a similar — if not loftier — sustain-
ability goal. 

SBX7-1 requires California to 
achieve a 20-percent improvement 
in water-use efficiency per person 
by 2020. UCSD’s Climate Action 
Plan, designed in December 2008 by 
various faculty members, calls for an 
annual 4-percent reduction in campus 
water usage for five years, cutting 
overall water consumption 20 percent 
by 2014. 

As one chief proponent of the 
CAP, UCSD affiliate the Sustainable 
Solutions Institute kicked off its Water 
Collaborative program in October. 
The institute plans to dramatically 
reduce the university’s 800 million gal-
lons of annual water usage. The SSI, 
while not technically part of UCSD, is 
a subset of the California Institute for 
Telecommunications and Information 

Technology, which is housed on the 
UCSD campus. 

“We want to use UCSD as a test 
bed for water conservation,” SSI proj-
ect manager Kim McIntyre said. “We 
hope to utilize the intellectual capital 
on campus to figure out ways to cut 
back our water usage.”

According to McIntyre, a major 
SSI objective is developing water neu-
trality, or a campus’s ability to expand 
physically without increasing water 
need. 

The Water Collaborative has 
already proposed $60 million worth 
of projects — and that’s not the only 
effort toward water sustainability at 
UCSD. Campus Sustainability admin-
istrators are partnering with the city 
of San Diego to increase the use of 
recycled water.

Crews are installing low-flow 
water fixtures in residence halls, plant-
ing drought-tolerant vegetation and 
have been required to fix water leaks 
within 24 hours. 

In addition, new campus build-
ings are being constructed to be more 
water efficient, fitted to meet the 
“silver” standards of the Leadership 
in Energy and Environmental Design 

rating system. 
A proposed installation of low-

flow devices could cost upwards of 
$650,000.

Another proposal explores new 
sources of air-conditioning. The 
tentative system would employ the 
cool temperatures of the deep ocean 
trenches not far off the coast for 
campus cooling. If successful, the 
project could save $4 million and 100 
million gallons of water per year, sin-
gularly reducing water consumption 
by almost the full 20 percent outlined 
in the CAP.

The Clean Water Utility Initiative 
at UCSD is also working to install 
water meters to accurately record 
water usage figures and find potential 
avenues for water conservation.

Schwarzenegger’s plan will be 
funded through an $11.4 million 
bond. McIntyre said funding is scarce 
for sustainability, though the SSI 
has submitted a number of propos-
als to potential investors like Wal-
Mart and the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration.

at tfijalko@ucsd.edu.

Gupta decided the issue did not war-
rant the work of a committee. 

“We decided the issue didn’t need 
a special committee, and so many 
people to solve the problem,” Gupta 
said. 

The committee met approximate-
ly four times over the course of the 
2008-09 academic year. Members 
examined the original policy and 
then proposed a new policy, in which 
students would not be required to pay 
for facility use unless the usage were 
to incur extra costs. 

“If students using the facility 
means that special things need to be 
set up — such as electricians coming 
in — or the use diminishes the value 
and further usage of the facility, it’s 
fine to pay,” Benesch said.

Gupta agreed.
“We’re fine with students paying 

more for the cost of something like 
[the Sun God festival], which obvi-
ously needs a lot of external work to 
set up,” he said. “We just don’t want 

the facilities to be making a profit 
out of this.”

After the student policy changes 
were proposed last year, they ran 
into administrative roadblocks that 
prevented implementation. Benesch 
explained that when the proposal 
was suggested to the university’s 
Recreational Facilities Board, vari-
ous administrators expressed strong 
opposition to changing campus poli-
cy and postponed making a decision 
on the proposal.

Councilmembers will bring 
the proposal before the Athletic, 
Recreational and Sports Facilities 
Advisory Board (ARSFAB) again 
later this year. 

“This time, we have a very well-
informed group of student represen-
tatives on staff who understand the 
issues placed before them,” Benesch 
said. “[The group] won’t be suscepti-
ble to the power dynamic that invari-
ably comes up in campus politics that 
fails to let student voice be heard.”

Benesch also met with former UC 

Student Regent D’Artagnan Scorza 
during Fall Quarter 2008 to discuss 
the double-charging issue, but said he 
has not met with current UC Student 
Regent Jesse Bernal. 

“It’s not an issue people will get 
passionate about and speak up for, 
so the student regent hasn’t,” Benesch 
said. “People will obviously rally and 
protest for fees, but not really for 
being double-charged to use their 
facilities.” 

However, policy revision has con-
tinued into this year, and council-
members are still concerned about 
the issue, which Gupta has intro-
duced at meetings with the chairs of 
the six college councils. 

“We will still be seeking new poli-
cies for facility use going into the 
future,” Gupta said.

Both Gupta and Benesch said they 
hope to have the revised policy imple-
mented by early Winter Quarter.

funding for sustainability-related 
projects, students must submit com-
prehensive applications. Their proj-
ects are required to promote sustain-
ability, have measurable outcomes, 
demonstrate that they exceed mini-
mum sustainability requirements and 
include plans to track effectiveness on 
campus. The SSC staff reviews each 
application and accepts or denies its 
project, then determines how much 
money it will receive.

According to Souder, the new 
space is constructed almost entirely 
of sustainable products. She said she 
is confident the building will receive 
a silver — if not gold — Leadership 
in Energy and Environmental Design 
rating score, which measures a build-
ing’s capacity to save energy, conserve 
water, reduce carbon dioxide emis-
sions, improve indoor air quality and 
use resources responsibly. 

According to Souder, the biggest 
challenge in the creation of the SRC 
was securing a source of funding.

“When we obtained our original 
estimates and made the request for 
funds, we thought we would be able 
to complete the SRC for about $100 
a square foot,” Souder said. “As we 
added sustainable features and inno-
vative products, the costs increased. 
We didn’t have enough money to 
make the building as sustainable as 
we would have liked.”

Several donors, however, have 
played a major role in covering the 

difference, supplying products such 
as the flooring and furniture. 

“Our partners have pulled out 
the stops and not just contributed 
‘things,’ but have put their heart and 
souls into making this place beautiful 
and innovative,” Souder said. 

Avendaño said that the short-
term goal for the center is to rede-
fine sustainability in terms of both 
“environmental justice” and “social 
behavior.” 

She stressed that the center is not 
the final answer to sustainability solu-
tions, but instead a space designed to 
provide collaboration, publicity, net-
working and marketing opportunities 
for interested participants.

“The SRC is a catalyst for a sus-

tainability movement on campus,” 
Avendaño said. “It doesn’t start and 
end with the SRC.”

Student organizations on campus 
such as CalPIRG are already using 
the center to promote their causes.  

Members of the SCC pitched the 
idea for the SRC a few years ago, part-
nering with Campus Sustainability 
staff to eventually create the center.

“We hope it will be a warm, invit-
ing, pleasant space for people to be 
in and to learn about sustainability,” 
Souder said.

The center will officially open to 
the public on Dec. 1.

STATISTICS COURTESY OF UCSD OFFICE OF STUDENT RESEARCH

L ong trumpeted by academic counselors as a useful tool for budgeting out the long road ahead, the four-year plan has been a UCSD staple for decades. But for some students, four years just isn’t cutting it. 
For the graduating class of 2008, only 57 percent 

of all first-time freshman were able to fit everything 
in 12 quarters.

Although the number of students extending 
their stay has slowly come down since the late ’90s 
(with the average time-to-degree peaking in the 
2002-2003 academic year at 13.5 quarters), a batch 
of students are juggling a new collection of con-
cerns for staying a fifth year.

As the nation’s economy sputters and the job 
market becomes more competitive — unemploy-
ment rates have risen over 4 percent nationally 
since 2005 — motivation to stay in college for an 
extra year has multiplied. 

There’s just one minor setback: According to 
UCSD’s 2009-10 undergraduate budget, it will cost 
$24,930 for a student to pay the year in units, uni-
versity fees, books and basic living costs. And that’s 
nearly a $1,200 increase from the previous year. 

For some students debating whether or not to 
stay on for year five, the climbing cost of tuition 
(in lieu of the UC Board of Regents’ decision to 
increase student fees by 32 percent last Thursday) is 
a new factor to consider. 

Fortunately for Katie Tippets, a Marshall College 
mechanical-engineering major in her fifth year, 
tuition wasn’t an issue. Because her mother works 
at Stanford University, the cost of her education is 
covered in full.

“I’m really lucky I didn’t have to worry about 
tuition for an extra year,” Tippets said. “The whole 
money situation would have definitely been a fac-
tor.” 

After transferring from UC Santa Barbara as 
a junior, Tippets adopted a five-year plan when 
she discovered many of her classes didn’t transfer 
between schools. She had to repeat a few general-
education courses and prerequisites just to gain 
access to her required engineering courses. 

In fact, the transfer-student population is 
a main contributor to the fifth-year epidemic. 
According to UCSD’s Office of Student Research 
and Information, on average, transfer students have 
always taken at least three years to complete their 
bachelor’s-degree requirements at UCSD. Almost 78 
percent graduated within nine quarters (for a total 
of five years), and 22 percent needed even longer. 

According to Eleanor Roosevelt College Dean 
of Advising Sarah Spear-Barrett, students must 
stay cognizant of the maximum number of units to 
which they are allowed. Once a student has reached 
this limit, he or she is forced — under contract — 
to graduate. Spear-Barret said she advises students 
to keep an eye on their unit capacity before mak-
ing the decision to extend their collegiate lifespan. 
Currently, the maximum is 200 units for a bachelor 
of arts degree, 230 units for a bachelor of science 
degree and 240 units for double majors.

For Warren College fifth-year Louis Topper, 
overlooking an opportunity to study abroad to 
ensure a standard fourth-year graduation was out of 
the question.

“I was unable to include a study-abroad experi-
ence and finish my mechanical-engineering degree 
in four years,” Topper said. “But I decided I wanted 
to go to Sweden. I needed that for my collegiate 
experience, and this was the only way to do it.” 

According to the Programs Abroad Office, 
most students make progress toward their degrees 
— taking GE and major classes — while studying 
abroad through the Education Abroad Program. 
But whether or not a student can graduate on time 
depends on his or her major, how long that student 
remains abroad and what classes are available in his 
or her particular program.

LUCHA LIBRE GOURMET TACO SHOP

SITESEEN T he holidays are drawing nearer, so of course you’re craving food from home — but there’s life beyond the turkey. We’re talking sketchy street food served out of a rickety cart posted in front of your favorite 
hometown dive bar. We’re talking BWHDs (bacon-wrapped hot dogs), 
affectionately known as bacon dogs in the Bay or alley dogs in LA. 

San Diegans call them TJ dogs. For a decidedly less questionable ver-
sion than you’d get from your go-to roadside vendor, look no further than 
the Lucha Libre Gourmet Taco Shop in Mission Hills.

Perched on a steep Washington St. slope, Lucha Libre claims to use 
only fresh ingredients and top-quality meats (guess, that’s what makes 
them “gourmet.”) Libre’s take on the TJ dog — a frank wrapped in bacon, 
onions and a medley of sauces — will more than remedy even the most 
severe case of munchies. 

So will the rest of the menu, populated by both taco-shop usuals and 
non-traditions like the chipotle-smothered “loaded baked potato.” Try a 
“queso taco”: two tortillas covered in a crunchy layer of cheese, avocado 
slices, special sauce and either steak, chicken or fries. And spice it up with 
Libre’s ever-changing rotation of salsas, limited-edition creations by own-
ers/brothers Diego and Jose Luis Rojano. Highlights have included a bold 
beer-flavored salsa for San Diego Beer Week and an apple-flavored hot 
sauce.

Turns out, gourmet tacos and burritos taste that much better atop 
zebra-printed bar stools beneath a TV blaring Mexican wrestling. Photos, 
masks and autographs in kitschy gold frames complement the shop’s hot-
pink walls, illuminated by a spinning disco ball. Call 24 hours in advance 
to reserve the roped-off “champion’s booth” lined top to bottom in gold 
— the staff will even don the Lucha Libre masks hanging on the walls as 

they serve you “tap out tacos,” “smackdown 
quesadillas” on porcelain plates and horchata 
in gold-trimmed pimp cups.

Open until 2:30 a.m. on weekends, Libre’s 
in-your-face gusto will make it your favorite 
post-bar pitstop. And with Bar Dynamite (a 

small club beloved by house and old-school hip-hop heads) next door, 
along with a liquor shop two storefronts down, it makes a convenient 
cap to a night out in Mission Hills. If you’re coming from the Gaslamp 
Quarter, ask your designated driver to exit the I-5 on Sassafras and get in 
the ring with some kickin’ Mexican cuisine.

INFOCUS CANDLELIGHT VIGIL

F ollowing a protest that barricaded the intersection in front of the Gilman Parking Structure, students gathered in front of Geisel 
Library to hold a candlelight vigil for the “death of 
public education.”

Both protests were in reaction to the Nov. 19 
decision by the UC Board of Regents to approve 
a two-step student-fee increase that will raise 
undergraduate tuition more than $2,500, or 32 
percent, by the 2010-2011 academic year. Annual 
fees will then total about $10,302 per student.

Beginning around dusk, the student 
demonstration included candlelit chants and signs 
reading “Death By UC Regents.” A.S. Associate Vice 
President of Student Aff airs Gracelynne West and 
Revelle College fi fth-year Sam Jung joined fellow 
classmates and faculty in voicing their frustration 
with the fee hikes, passing around a mic so 
members of the crowd could participate.

Other UC campuses held similar protests 
following the regents’ decision. Many of the 
students at the UCSD vigil had attended the mass 
protests at UCLA, one day prior where a tent 
city was set up to accommodate the two-day 
demonstration.

FOCUS� MONDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 2009� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 11 

Then, of course, there are the 
double-major with a minor on 
the side overachievers who simply 
can’t fit everything into a four-year 
schedule. Or those who just decide 
to change majors halfway through 
their college careers (if not multiple 
times), fully embracing the extra 
year of college they’re tacking onto 
their lives.

Warren College senior Colin 
Scholtz said he faced an inevitable 
fifty year after changing his major.

“For my first 2 years, I was a 
chemistry major but I switched 
to chemical engineering at the 
start of my 3rd year.” Scholtz said. 
“Chemical engineering courses have 
different prerequisites and I needed 
to take way more math classes to be 
an engineer.” 

Though Scholtz admitted that 
paying another year of tuition will 
be tough, he said he’s still willing to 
bite the bullet for the cause.

 “In the long-run though, the 
degree is going to be worth it, and 
it’s something I really want to do,” 
Scholtz said. “Although the techni-
cal field isn’t affected too much, I 
know that a lot of companies aren’t 
hiring as much as they normally 
would.”

For Revelle College senior 
Victoria Cho, on the other hand, 
the plan to extend a college career 
can be a strategy in itself.

Cho, a pharmacological-chemis-
try major, plans to stay an extra year 
to enhance her credentials for phar-
macy school. Instead of loading up 
on the maximum number of units, 
Cho takes three classes a quarter, 
allowing her to spend more time on 
each class while working two jobs.

“In order to make myself a better 
candidate for grad school, I feel like 
I need to do more extracurricular 

activities, boost my GPA and just 
be a better person to get into the 
school I want to get into,” Cho said. 

Spear-Barrett said she believes 
the pros and cons of staying a fifth 
year really depend on a student’s 
personal situation.

“The student needs to evaluate 
whether it’s worth it to pay for the 
cost of an education in an attempt 
to boost their cumulative GPA by a 
little bit,” she said.

For others she said, it may be 
wiser to find a job before graduation 
and gain some real-world experi-
ence; allowing for students to begin 
paying off their loans and working 
towards expanding their resumes 
with more than just student clubs. 

Fifth-years could also be taking 
refuge in college to avoid the pains 
of searching for a job. Although 
student statistics are not yet avail-
able beyond the 2007-2008 academic 
year, UCSD economics professor 
Gordon Dahl said that enrollment 
patterns could reveal a greater num-
ber of students seeking and extend-
ing undergraduate degrees due to 
economic circumstances.

 “Enrollment in college is gener-
ally found to be countercyclical,” 
Dahl said. “When the economy is 
bad, more students enroll in college, 
and when the economy is good, 
fewer students enroll.”

According to Topper, there is 
really no reason to rush out of col-
lege. 

“Education is a speed-through 
process,” Topper said. “But what 
are we really working toward, other 
than a nine-to-five job? I want 
to focus on my education a little 
longer and possibly make time for 
other pursuits.”

Dan Simmons Comedy Club of Higher LearningCLUBHOPPING

I n case you were deceived by its loft title, the illustrious Dan Simmons Comedy Club of 
Higher Learning only promises 
to reach its members one thing: 
how to be funny. 

That is, high-class stand-up 
funny, courtesy of the legendary 
Dan Simmons himself.

Never heard of him? 
Simmons, as it turns out, is a 
Sixth College senior whose talent 
is somewhat hereditary. From 
an early age, Simmons said, he’s 
been surrounded by profession-
als.

“My dad is a stand-up 
comedian doing comedy in 
Hollywood,” he said. “My dad’s 
always been my mentor — and 
so I thought that I could do it, 
found that it was a lot of fun and 
continued.”

Just don’t call him narcis-
sistic: The club’s moniker wasn’t 
originally his idea. 

“I wanted to name it the 
Stand-Up Comedy Club, but 
my friend said, ‘Come on, 
make it something memorable,” 
Simmons said. “So it just became 
the Dan Simmons Comedy Club 
of Higher Learning. We joke that 
it’s not professional, but the idea 
is not to make it serious, but to 
make it fun. The name is keep-
ing with that spirit.” 

Simmons learned early on 
that comedy is easier watched 
than performed — once he real-
ized how frustrating it could 
be to develop a feel for what 
different audiences find funny 
— he went on to develop a space 
where amateurs like himself 
could practice and improve.

“There’s really no formal 
experience in stand-up, it’s learn 

as you go,” he said.
That’s why the club goes for 

a hands-on approach. During 
meetings, various members — 
many of whom are also part of 
Muir College improv troupe 
FOOSH — perform skits and 
improv games while others 
watch and offer detailed and 
constructive feedback. 

“Standup comedy is precari-
ous,” Simmons said. “You can 
say one word wrong [look] like 
a fool, and your entire routine 
is ruined. When amateur come-
dians do [routines], usually 
nobody laughs, and then you 
don’t know what you did right or 
wrong.”

According to Simmons, no 
previous experience is necessary 
to join the club, and it welcomes 
comedy lovers at all different 
levels — even those uninterested 
in getting onstage.

“We have people that don’t 
want to perform; they just come 
to laugh,” Simmons said. 

The Dan Simmons Comedy 
Club of Higher Learning meets 
Tuesdays at 7:30 p.m. in Center 
217.

The club will be hosting 
an open-mic performance on 
Thursday, Jan. 21 from 7:30 p.m. 
to 9 p.m. at Porter’s Pub in the 
Student Center.

waiting patiently for students to use 
its expansive digs.

The construction of the cen-
ter cost the university roughly 
$100,000 (excluding the cost of a 
contractor and designer). An addi-
tional $170,000 in donations also 
helped fund the center’s upstart 
money which could have 
been put to more active 
use had the center’s ini-
tiatives been hashed out 
around existing round-
tables.

The extra cash could 
perhaps have helped fund 
existing programs that 
impact the environment 
— like UCSD’s commuter 
shuttles, which reduce 
our carbon footprint but 
are facing budgetary con-
straints in 2010.

Or sustainability coor-
dinators could have worked toward 
increased sustainability in the on-
campus apartments and dorms, 
with efforts as simple as installing 
energy-efficient light bulbs and 
recycled flooring in the under-con-
struction Muir housing. Tangible 
results would have been preferable 
to spending thousands on a shallow 
shrine to our monumental green-
ness. 

Granted, a pre-existing facility 
wouldn’t have boasted gimmicky 
furnishings like sustainable paint, 
interior walls, countertops and tiles 
in a nifty little IKEA showroom. 
But the showy presentation reeks of 
frivolity just so the university can 
brag it’s the best of its kind.

But now that the center is up 
and running, the amount of money 
it’s allotted should also be carefully 
monitored by the students footing 
the bill, judging by the lopsided 
nature of some previous sustain-
ability efforts. The dining hall 
compost bins, for instance, have 
revealed themselves to be no more 
than glorified garbage bins (the 
contents aren’t actually composted, 
but thrown away like any other old 
pile of trash). Though the bin ini-
tiative is next to costless, it’s deceiv-
ing to students and might as well 

be completed now that the money 
exists.

Perhaps forming an A.S. over-
sight committee to review the cen-
ter’s operational budget (not unlike 
the one proposed to watch over the 
Loft) could help ensure our fees 
aren’t misused on more frivolities. 
Such a board would provide the 

necessary check 
for a center 
responsible for 
an estimated 
$50,000, which 
it will receive 
from our tuition 
dollars each year. 
For now, only 
two undergradu-
ates serve on 
the Advisory 
Committee on 
Sustainability 
— not nearly 
enough man-

power to ensure our fees aren’t 
misappropriated by shifty admin-
istrators. 

It’s also important that the cen-
ter’s proposed far-reaching goals 
— such as reducing campus water 
usage by at least 4 percent — aren’t 
bogged down in a series of unreal-
istic hopes and dreams, like campus 
org Aquaholic Anonymous’ plan 
to ban the sale of bottled water on 
campus. 

Active members need to cre-
ate some tangible goals to build 
upon. Right now all they have is a 
number of large, complicated and 
time-consuming plans — such as 
expanding the reclaimed water-
distribution system and replacing 
water-intensive landscaping with 
drought-resistant alternatives. 

One of the most praise-
worthy aspects of the center’s 
mission to create a home for 
sustainable activity at UCSD is 
the provision for student par-
ticipation in the future of all 
sustainability work, which has 
the opportunity to flourish with 
the proper care. 

The Green Initiative Fund, 
for instance, provides $80,000 
a year in grants to fund students’ 
sustainability efforts. The grants 

will allow students to become more 
involved with both the univer-
sity and sustainability efforts, and 
spread awareness through a high-
visibility program. 

A shining example of student 
involvement would be the proposed 
Urban Farms program, which offers 
the opportunity for students to grow 
their own food. This program could 
allow students to limit the amount of 
food imported from foreign destina-
tions, reducing our carbon imprint 
by following an eat-and-grow local-
ized philosophy. A UCSD fruit and 
vegetable patch could even serve as 
a gateway project for students inter-
ested in pursuing global sustainabil-
ity. These kinds of more-affordable 
goals are the type the center should 
be chasing.

Some great ideas will likely grow 
from the building; it is important, 
however, that the center doesn’t 
umbrella too much too soon — or 
it runs the risk of becoming just 
another green star on the univer-
sity’s list of environmental accom-
plishments.

SPORTS� MONDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 2009� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 15 

On Thursday night, the Tritons 
won in the first round, taking revenge 
on the San Francisco State Gators — 
who, earlier this season, ended a Triton 
win streak of 16 games. With the three-
set victory, the Tritons notched their 
first postseason sweep since 2004, 
when they swept Cal State Bakersfield 
in the first round.

“We saw some mistakes from that 
loss, and the girls responded well with 
the adjustments,” Black said.

Through the entire match, the 
Tritons had the clear advantage, rarely 
playing from behind. Schmidt — who 
was just named conference player 
of the year — played at peak per-
formance, and the rest of the team 

stepped up their game to remove the 
Gators’ postseason hopes.

Despite the victory on Thursday 
night, UCSD’s season will now come 
to an end. It will be the last collegiate 
performance for four Tritons, but the 
majority of the team will return to play 
next season, ready for another chance.

“It’s hard to replace some great 
players,” Black said. “You just have to 
create a different dynamic of the team 
and work with that. All our middles 
are coming back, so there’s obviously 
a big plus for us. But that’s college 
athletics: reloading and making a new 
picture.”

with McTigue, who led the Tritons 
with nine goals — for the critical shot.

“We were just pounding them,” 
McTigue said. “It was just a matter of 
time, and we ended up getting one.”

After the teams played out the 
remainder of regulation scoreless, the 
match entered a 10-minute overtime 
period. Both defenses held firm, lead-
ing to a second overtime period. After 
another scoreless 10 minutes, the game 
ended in a 2-2 draw, and the two teams 
prepared for penalty kicks. 

The Toros shot first, and — to 
the home crowd’s delight — the kick 
missed the mark. Bradley nailed the 
Tritons’ first attempt with a shot to the 
left of the net. The Toros rebounded, 
netting their second attempt. 

Freshman midfielder Jessica Wi 
then missed her fateful shot.

After two rounds, the score was tied 
1-1. The Toros made their third kick, 
and sophomore forward Courtney 
Capobianco missed her attempt, leav-
ing the Toros with a 2-1 advantage. 
Dominguez Hills missed its fourth 

kick, offering the Tritons a brief glim-
mer of hope before sophomore mid-
fielder Sara Bolton missed her shot. 
The next Toro kicker found the back of 
the net, sealing the deal and ending the 
season for UCSD.

“We were by far the better team 
tonight,” McManus said. “The posses-
sions we had, the buildups we had — I 
thought we were much, much better.”

In terms of possession, the Triton 
offense dominated the entire match. 
UCSD outshot Dominguez Hills by a 
whopping 14 shots, leading the Toros 
24-10. The Tritons also had a huge 
12-3 corner-kick advantage. 

“That team tonight gave me every-
thing,” McManus said. “Any other 
team, down 2-0 to Dominguez in the 
second half, would have buckled. We 
knew there was time; we knew we 
could still play. I have no problems 
with this team whatsoever. They’ll 
come back next year, [and] they’ll be a 
year older and a year stronger.”

until Loyola Marymount sophomore 
Max Schlegel put the Lions on top 
with a shot from outside of five meters. 
Schlegel’s score would end up being the 
winning goal, as UCSD was held score-
less for the rest of the game.

With the win, the Lions will advance 
to the NCAA tournament, while the 
Tritons end their season on another 
disappointing loss to their rival.

“I could not be more proud of this 
team,” Harper said. “We got better 
every week and just came up a little 
short. We are all aware of the bumpy 
road we had to travel not having our 
home pool for most of the season. I’m 
extremely proud of the season and 
extremely proud of the seniors.”

After securing the No. 3 seed 
for the tournament, the Tritons had 
their hands full in their opening 
game against No. 6 seed University of 
Redlands. UCSD fell behind in the first 
quarter 4-2 before putting up five goals 

in the second period to tie the game 
7-7 at the half.

The Tritons found themselves in a 
9-7 hole in the third quarter, but used 
three scores in the last two-and-a half-
minutes of the quarter to take a 10-9 
lead. UCSD carried this momentum 
into the fourth period, taking its larg-
est lead of the game with just under 
five minutes to play. 

Nursing a 12-9 advantage, the 
Tritons saw their lead quickly fade in 
a Redlands rally. The Bulldogs evened 
the score in the final ticks of the fourth 
quarter, sending the game into over-
time. Sophomore utility Lance Curtiss 
and senior driver Sean Roberts netted 
scores in the first overtime period, 
securing the 14-13 victory for UCSD.

Following the unexpectedly tight 
game, the Tritons faced off against No. 
7 seed Whittier College, which had 
pulled an upset over No. 2 seed Air 
Force Academy in the Poets’ opening 
game.

The Tritons put the Poets away 
early on, scoring nine unanswered 
goals to start the semifinal match. The 
Poets managed to net one score in 
the first half to make the game 9-1 at 
the break. UCSD didn’t let up in the 
second half, cruising to a 16-3 blowout 
victory.

Senior two-meter defender Steven 
Donohoe led UCSD with five goals, 
and four other Tritons netted multiple 
scores. Sophomore goalkeeper David 
Morton held his own in the cage, 
blocking the first seven Poet shots and 
finishing the game with 12 saves. 

“On Saturday, it was probably one 
of the most lopsided semifinals ever,” 
Harper said. “The guys wanted to rid 
themselves of any bad feelings from 
the overtime win. We needed to play 
well Saturday so that we could carry 
momentum into the finals.”

16 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

By John Beck

WOMEN’S SOCCER — The UCSD 
women’s soccer team saw quarterfinal 
dreams crushed at the 2009 NCAA 
Division-II tournament after a crushing 
defeat to Cal State Dominguez Hills on 
Nov. 20. The game was ultimately lost 
in a tie-breaking penalty-kick shootout.

The two teams played to a 2-2 tie 
before the Toros edged the Tritons 3-1 in 
penalty kicks. The heartbreaking shoot-
out ended the Tritons’ spectacular sea-
son with a record of 15-5-2.

The Tritons stepped onto their  home 
turf Friday night with one option in 
mind: victory. Playing before 1,000 
screaming fans, the Tritons had the 
opportunity to advance to the NCAA 
quarterfinals while eliminating archri-
val Dominguez Hills in the process. 
The Toros had edged the Tritons from 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Championship on Nov. 6 
and dealt the Tritons another loss on 
Nov. 1 in their final regular-season game. 
Emotions ran high on both sides, as the 
fate of an entire season was on the line. 
UCSD looked to strike first. Coming 
into the match, the Tritons were 13-1 in 
games where they scored first, and only 
2-4-1 when conceding the first goal. 
However, the Toro defenders kept the 
Triton offense at bay, and the two squads 
entered halftime with the score tied 0-0.

Just three minutes into the start of the 
second period, Dominguez Hills caught 
the Tritons offguard and took a 1-0 lead 
off of a Toro free kick. The quick score 
destabilized the Tritons, and — less than 

two minutes later — UCSD surrendered 
an own goal on a Toro throw-in and a 
bobble by sophomore goalkeeper Kristin 
Armstrong. In less than five minutes, the 
Tritons found themselves down a daunt-
ing 2-0, with a staunch Dominguez Hills 
smelling victory.

 “I thought there was four minutes of 
madness to start the second half,” head 
coach Brian McManus said. “Our goal-
keeper made one slip that she’d never 
make, and the ball bounced in.” 

Down 2-0 with 40 minutes left to 
play, the Tritons realized just how close 
their season was to ending, and woke 
up with a start. UCSD went into attack 
mode, and the offense quickly found its 
rhythm. In the 58th minute, freshman 
midfielder Danielle Dixon sent a cross 
from the left to junior defender and 

Triton captain Lisa Bradley. Bradley then 
sent a header over the Toro keeper, trim-
ming the Toro lead to 2-1. The goal gave 
Dixon her first assist of the season and 
Bradley her first career postseason goal.

“We really dug deep,” sophomore 
forward Sarah McTigue said, “It really 
helped when Lisa got that goal in. It 
switched the momentum around for us.”

UCSD kept up the attack and tied 
the match at 2-2 in the 78th minute. 
The equalizer came when sophomore 
midfielder Anne Wethe sent a low pass 
to McTigue, who worked around two 
defenders and lifted a shot over the Toro 
keeper from 12 yards out. The pass went 
to Wethe — the Tritons’ leader in assists, 
with eight this season — and connected

MEN’S WATER POLO — For 
the past three seasons, the Tritons 
have struggled to get the better 
of their rival, Loyola Marymount 
University, and have been unsuc-
cessful in both playoff and regular-
season games. Yesterday afternoon, 
UCSD ran into the same troubles 
at the conference championships.

No. 8 Loyola Marymount 
defeated No. 10 UCSD 5-4 in the 
Western Water Polo Association 
Championships on Nov. 22 in 
Orange, Calif., securing the Lions’ 
third conference title and ending 
the Tritons’ 2009 season.

“We were confident, had an 
excellent gameplan and we execut-
ed perfectly,” head coach Denny 
Harper said. “Anytime you lose a 
game by a score of 5-4, that means 
you were right there.    

The Tritons faced off against 
their rival after securing victories 
over the University of Redlands 
and Whittier College in the first 
two rounds of playoffs. Following 

the trend of previous matchups 
between Loyola Marymount and 
UCSD, the teams battled back 
and forth throughout the match. 
UCSD got on the board first to 
start the game, and from then on, 
the two teams traded goals for the 
next three-and-a-half quarters. 

With the score tied 2-2 in the 
third quarter, the Tritons took a 3-2 
lead with 4:49 left in the period, 

but the Lions stormed right back, 
tying the game on the next pos-
session. The teams added one goal 
apiece in the third period to tie the 
game at 4-4 entering the fourth 
quarter.

The defenders continued their 
strong play in the fourth quarter, 
and neither team was able to score

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — It was 
deja vu for the No. 3 Tritons this past 
weekend, when they fell to No. 19 Cal 
State Los Angeles in the NCAA West 
Region Semifinals on Nov. 20 for the 
second-straight year. 

The Golden Eagles felled the 
Tritons after a hard-fought match, 
ending the UCSD women’s season and 
effectively taking senior outside hit-
ter Sylvia Schmidt at bay by holding 
her to 12 kills — one kill below her 
season average for three-set games. In 
the past two seasons, the Tritons have 
dropped four out of six matches to the 
Golden Eagles, two of which came in 
the playoffs. 

After being swept on Saturday 
night, the Tritons fall out of postseason 
play while the Golden Eagles advanced 
to the next round.

“It feels pretty low,” head coach 
Tom Black said. “It’s hard not to hurt 
a little bit after this one. We beat them 
twice this year. There’s no doubt that 
we can beat them; it’s just the way it 
happens.”

In the first set, the Tritons held a 
small advantage, taking a brief lead 
on early plays. However, the Golden 
Eagles went on an 8-0 run off a close 
score to take the lead 20-15 — the 
largest of the set for either team. The 
Tritons battled back within two points, 
but could not pull any closer in the set 
and eventually fell 25-21.

“I thought [Cal State Los Angeles] 
played the best I’ve ever seen them 
play,” Black said. “We had some nice 
moments, but I think that on the 
whole we struggled. It’s just that com-
bination.”

In the second set, the Tritons came 
out strong, looking to avenge the out-
come of the previous set. Taking seven 
of the first 10 points, the Tritons were 

performing at the peak of their game, 
but — much like in the first set — the 
Golden Eagles went on a run of their 
own and took a three-point lead half-
way through the set. 

The Tritons battled back to a tie 
and took their second lead of the night 
21-20 after a kill by Schmidt. The 
Golden Eagles finished even stronger, 
though, finishing the second set off 
25-21. 

Coming out of halftime, the Golden 
Eagles jumped to a five-point lead and 
never looked back. The Tritons fought 
to come within one point, but CSULA 
regained the advantage and held on 
tightly to an effective lead, closing out 
the match and the upset with a third 
straight win, 25-22.
