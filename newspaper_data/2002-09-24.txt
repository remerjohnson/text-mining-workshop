t was a day of tears and cheers as most members of the 
freshman class moved into their respective residence 
halls and apartments on Sept. 2 1. Sixth College allowed 
its inaugural class to move in on Sept. 18. 

T his year, UCSD will welcome 4,350 incoming freshmen who 
were selected from a pool of 41 ,354 applicants and had an average 
high school C PA of 3.93 and an average SAT score of 1238. 

Cars, minivans and sport urility vehicl es began linll1g lip along 
campus roads at 9 a.m., when students were allowed to begin 
chccking in, and lasted until about 3 p.m. 

Boris Babnko, an Ea rl 'vVarrcn Coll ege freshman living in the 
residence halls, began moving II1to his room around 11 a.m. He 
drove. down ti-om Orange Country with his parents earlier that 
morlllng.

Campus leaders pay tribute to 
those who fell in tragedies 

By DANA WEST

UCSD remembered the vic-
tims of the Sept. 11 , 2001, terror-
ist actions on the World Trade 
Center and the Pentagon on the 
anniversary of the attacks with a 
ceremony held in the Price 
Center, followed by an interfaith 
memorial ervice for Sept. 11 vic-
tims. 

The ceremony began with the 
presentation of colors by AI Hilde 
and Kenneth Edwards of the 
Veterans' Staff Association. Music 
professor Phil Larson sung "The 
Star Spangled Banner." 

Chancellor Robert Dynes said 

a few words of welcome before 
introducing A.S . President Jenn 
Brown and Graduate Students 
Association President Tom 
Fleming, who presented the 
memorial tree and plaque that 
will stand on the Warren lawn. 

In his speech, Dynes reflected 
on the moments in history during 
which various generations came 
of <1ge. He described his parents' 
generation coming of age during 
the Great Depression and World 
War II, with his generation com-
ing of age during the Civil Rights 
movement and the Viemam War.

BRIEFLY 
Grace period provided for 

student parking 
Students and visitors will be able to park 

In yellow ·5' parking spaces without penal-
ty until Sept. 25. During th is period, permits 
will still be enforced for green "B" spaces 
and red 'W' spaces. 

For the 2002-2003 year, parking permits 
for undergraduates are S 135 per quarter 
and $1 80 per quarter for graduate students. 

Students can purchase permits either In 
advance via studentLink or in person at the 
parking office. The parking office will have a 
separate line for students who pre-pur-
chase their permits online. 

The use of parking permits will be 
enforced on the first day of classes on Sept 
26. Parking fines have increased since last 
year, with fines starting at S40 rather than $21 . 

The parking office will be open during 
Welcome Week from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. More 
information can be obtained by calling 
Parking Services at (858) 534-4223 or vis-
iting http.//iM1IW.porking.ucsd.edu. 

Fall deadline to waive 
USHIP approaching 

Undergraduates have until ad. 4 to 
petition to waive the Undergraduate 
Student Health Insurance Plan. Those who 
successfully waive the fee for the fall will 
not be assessed the $181 fee. 

Beginning in fall 200 1, the'University of 
California required health insurance of all 
registered students. Those without health 
Insurance or those with a plan that does 
not meet the UC requirements will be 
assessed the quarterly fee. 

Students who miss the deadline or do 
not meet the minimum requirements will 
have another opportunity to waive the 
UsHIP fee at the beginning of winter quar-
ter. Successfully waiving the USHIP for the 
fall also exempts students for the 2002-
2003 academic year. 

The requirements and online waiver are 
available online at 
http';/WWN.studentlink.ucsd.edu.

Stuart Art Colledion 
benefador dies 

James Stuart DeSilva, founder and 
benefador of the Stuart Colledion, died 
unexpededly on Sept. 12 of an apparent 
stroke at his Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., home. 

In 1980, DeSilva partnered with UCsD 
and funded the Stuart Colledion in 1982 
with funds from a foundation that he creat-
ed. The first work commissioned was Niki 
de Saint Phalle's Sun God. The colledion 
now contains 15 pieces. 

After graduating from the University of 
Chicago, DeSilva served as a Navy pilot dur-
ing World War II. After the war, he made his 
fortune in tuna canning. 

DeSilva served on the boards of San 
Diego's Museum of Contemporary Art, 
the San Diego Symphony and the San 
Diego Museum of Art. At UCsD, he was 
awarded the Chancellor's Associates 
Distinguished Service Medal and the 
Revelle Medal. He also served on the UC 
San Diego Foundation Board, the Board 
of Overseers and as president of the 
Stuart Foundation. 

DeSilva is survived by his wife, Mame; 
his son and daughter; four grandchildren 
and two great grandchildren. 

Chemist. co-discoverer 
of Carbon-14 dies 

Martin Kamen, co-discoverer of carbon-
14 and an emeritus professor of chemistry 
at UCsD died on Au;:: j 1 in Santa Barbara 
at age 89. 

Kamen, in collaboration with the late 
Sam Ruben, a UC Berkeley chemist, dis-
covered the radioisotope in 1940 while 
both were working at the Lawrence 
Radiation Laboratory In Berkeley. 

Joining UCsD in 1961, Kamen was one 
of six professors who founded the chemistry 
department at the fledgling university. In 
1995, Kamen received the Enrico Fermi 
Award, the federal govemmen(s oldest sci-
ence and technology award. 

He is survived by his son, David, of New 
York City, and his sister, Li llian Smith, of 
Chapel Hill, N.C.

sticlter every quaner was always extrerndy 
annoying," said Mike 'Pedersen, a Warren 
junioc. "Sometimes I wouldn't even get around 
to doing it until the quarter was pan:ia11y OYer, 
and then they wouldn't let me into the gym." 

Mark Cooper, director of Student 
Business Services, believes the elimination of 
the validation sticker is an extremely positive 
development. 

"We are confident that the online tool 
will enhance our abil ity to more accurately 
determine a student's registNtion status," 
Cooper said. "[It] will be a tremendous ben-
efit to the studen[S, who will no longer be 
required to stand in long lines each quarter 
to receive their sticker." 

A campus notice was issued last April, 
notifying departments of the initiative to 
eliminate the sticker. A survey was conducted 
to identify whether departments depended 
on the sticker for validati ng student registra-

tiOIl status . 
Of the 68 departments that responded, 13 

indicated that they relied on the sticker. Each 
of those departments was contacted, and 
their concerns were included in the design of 
the new alternative. . 

With the new online registration valida-
tion tool, tiacuJty can obtain a student'sregis-
tration status in three ways: by entering the 
student's personal identification number; by 
swiping the student's 10 card with a magnet-
ic stripe reader, which tiacuJty can attach to 
their computers; or by entering the bar code 
into a computer manually. 

The status of the student will then be 
revealed as registered or unregistered for the 
current quarter. Faculty can also detennine 
: egistration status retrospectively . 

"I'm glad that they finally toolc all this out 
of the students' hands," Pedersen said. "That 
stupid sticker always had a tendency to peel 
off."

Homeland defense projects unveiled 
UCSD faculty display year's worth of research efforts 

By EVAN McLAUGHLIN 
News Editor 

Prompted by the Sept. I I ter-
rorist attacks, UCSD academics 
from V'Jrious fields of research have 
accelerated their studies over the 
last year in an effort to boost home-
land securiry. 

Innovations including a com-
puter chip designed to detect sarin 
gas and a real-time face recognition 
surveillance system were among 
the research projects showcased at 
a universiry-sponsored briefing on 
Sept. 4. 

"Cooperation and collaboration 
in the name of homeland security 
are now more important than ever 
before," said Fran Berman, direc-
tor of the San Diego 
Supercomputer Center. "We 
believe that the public's under-
standing of homeland security 
research and preparedness is 
increasingly important to a free 
and secure society." 

While multiple departments 
and disciplines were represented at 
the briefing, UCSD research 
efforts were classified into five 
groups: bioterrorismlanti-terror-
ism, cyber securiry, disaster detec-
tion and response, critical infra-
structure and public policy. 

"These are basic areas that in 
one way, shape or form cover the 
spectrum of things that the univer-
siry might be associated with in 
response to homeland securi ry," 
said Mark Thiemens, dean of 
UCS D's Divisipn of Physica l 
Sciences. T hiemens also presented 
his fi ndings concerning how 
atmospheric aerosols could be used 

to detect bioterrorist attacks. 
Among the anti-

terrorism/bioterrorism projects 
unveiled at the event was "smart 
dust," a powder developed in col-
laboration with researchers at UC 
Berkeley that iden tifies harmful 
chemical and biological agents in 
an environment, as wel l as a device 
that can identify TNT and picric 
acid explosives usi ng fluorescent 
sensors. T he first ora l drug treat-
ing sma ll pox infections was devel -
oped at UCSD as well. 

Another concern of UCSD fac-
ulty members was the need to pre-
serve and protect the Internet 
from "cyber-terrorists." Tom 
Perrine of rhe San Diego 
Supercomputer Center identified 
the Internet as a terrorist target 
because of the United States' 
heavy dependence upon rhe 
Internet as a tool for commerce 
and information. 

The Internet carries a significant 
portion of the U.S. gross domestic 
product, according to Perrine. He 
said that the U.S. economy remains 
vulnerable to disruption as long as 
the threat of cyber-terrorism exists. 
Perrine cited incidents in 2000 
when the Web sites of Yahoo, eBay 
and Amazon were attacked, affect-
ing data systems and economies in 
the Pacific Rim. 

Perrine's colleagues agree. 
"Cyber-terror ism · is real," 

Berman said. "We are painfully 
aware of how important protection 
of privacy and data security are in 
the current landscape." 

Frieder Seible of the Jacobs 
School of Engineering presenred 
his findi ngs on blast damage,

claiming that development of criti-
cal infrastructure protection is cru-
cial. Seible introduced multi-use 
sensor networks that are used on 
structures like the Coronado 
Bridge, which links cameras and 
seismic sensors to a monitoring 
system at the San Diego 
Supercomputer Center on the 
UCSD campus using high-speed, 
wire less Interne t. The project's 
goal is to make the network avail-
able to CalTRANS, the U.S. Coast 
Guard and other government 
agencies with an interest in moni-
toring structures.

Gra 
UCSO's diverse qualit ies e all other UC campuses 

By DANIEL WAn5 
Associate Opinion Editor 

Every freshman orientation at every UC 
school begins the same way: 

"Congrarulations! You're attending the 
best public university in California, if not the 
world. The campus is located near a historic 
and diverse city. It is home to Nobel Prize-
winning faculty, nationally recognized 
departments and a library housing millions of 
volumes. Our graduates are successful indi-
viduals who have made great contributions to 
society. You made the right decision, and 
we're sure you'll enjoy it here." 

At orientations, the deans try to propa-
gandize their freshmen with speeches about 
all the terrific things that the particular 
school has to offer. The similarities to other 
colleges end after orientation, though, and

difficult to list the various University 
of California campuses and objectively 
decide which one is the best, because most 
people are biased in favor of their own 
school. Depending on your individual taste, 
you might determine that the University of 
California at Riverside is better than the 
University of California at Davis, perhaps 
because you prefer UC Riverside's smog to 
UC Davis 's cows. It's hard to quantify some-
thing like the smell of a campus. 

Of course, there are certain attributes that 
can be quantified. Since any discussion of the 
UC campuses inevitably involves UC 
Berkeley, the alleged "flagship" of the 
University of California, Berkeley will be 
addressed first. 

The UC Berkeley campus resides 
within the town of Berkeley, which is 

what San Francisco would 
be if it were geo-

graphically 
smaller 

and 

from the ocean, had more crime and 
homeless-to-homeowner ratio, 

housing next to dirty parks, 
regular riots, and drug addicts roaming the 
streets. Berkeley is like a tiny San Francisco 
on crack. 

In the town of Berkeley, police statistics 
indicate there is a one-in- JO chance of being 
robbed, raped or beaten, compared to La 
Jolla's three percent chance of the same. The 
entire city of San Diego also has illower crime 
rate than Berkeley, with only a one in 25 
chance of being assaulted or robbed, proving 
that it's safer here. And it smells better, too. 

Plus, the phrase "Berkeley sucks" nets 43 
results in a Google search, while "UCSD 
sucks" rerurns only two. There's even a 
Berkeleysucks.com. As everyon(! knows, the 
Internet never lies. That should put to rest 
any claim that UCSD is inferior to UCB. 
Incidentally, we should all refrain from using 
UC Berkeley'S arrogant abbreviation "Cal," 
which is shorr for California, not Berkeley-
it only adds to its insufferable superiority 
complex. 

Besides having Googles blessing and a 
more accurate abbrevia~on, 

~" , 

.,----------

There's something amiss at UCSD that is hard to 
express in writing. Like the proverbial problem with-
out a name, it is insidious and subtle, affecting all while 
it escapes being labeled. 

renowned of the uc campuses - UC Berkeley, 
UCLA and even tile University of California at Davis 
- because it lacks an important fearuce that those all 
share: centrality, figuratively and literally. 

The necessity for centrality in a literal sense is an 
angst that all UCSD students share, and particularly 
those who have ever caught a gl impse of life at uni-
versities nurrured by college towns. There is a symbi-
otic relationship between a university and the commu-
nity surrounding it: When one is sic~, the other will 
hurt · as . well. If UCSD's environs are any measure 
against which to judge, then UCSD is very sick 
indeed. 

o 
But perhaps it is not so difficult to put a finger on 

what's wrong at UCSD. UCSD's problem is one of dis-
parity, the result of UCSD presenting itself as the best 
UC campus when it should really place itself closer to 
the bottom of the pile. Though UCSD is comprised of 
many points of brilliance, holistically it is weak, and 
that weakness taints all its assertions concerning great-
ness. ra 

UCSD also possesses many other redeeming 
qualities that make it the best public 
California university. 

Our mascot can kill everyone else's mascot. 
The UCSD Triton is, simply put, a god . 

He's an invincible being. He cannot be killed 
by mere mortals, and certainly not by the likes 
of the University of California at Santa Cruzs 
banana slug, the University of Californi.a at 
Irvine's anteater or the .twin grizzly bears

sort of fanner; no one's really sure. In either 
case, it can't stand up to the Triton. 

The only mascot that poses the slightest 
threat to our Triton is the other immortal : 
UC Riverside's Highlander. The Highlander, 
as seen on television, lives forever unless it is 
ki lled by another Highlander in a choreo-
graphed swordfight. However, as a god, the 
Triton may sti ll be able to smite the 
Highlander, since the Triton possesses a mag-
ical pitchfork (the phonetically confounding 
"trident") useful in close combat. The battle 

would be close, but it would've

UCSD's unconventional quirkiness is often praised 
as one of its strengths. That view, however, grossly 
ignores the big picnlre in favor of rosy-colored details. 
For every apparent victory that iconoclasts can claim, 
there is a fli p side, a blatant disregard for something 
else. 

UCSD has top-notch Division II sports teams, 
but no football team around which fans can congre-
gate . It has some of the greatest research minds in 
high-tech fields, but often overcrowded and imper-
sonal lectures led by cientists with an ineptitude in 
instruction . 

True, with a little ingenuity, a freshman without a 
car can escape the confines of La] olla Village Square 
and bus his way to fun in the greater San Diego 
region. But compare that kind of existence to that 
which Berkeleyans and Bruins experience. The 
vibrancy of the communities of Berkeley and 
Westwood feed their respective university culnlres, 
offering srudems a panoply of cultural and culinary 
experiences unmatched by anything around UCSD. 
The Triton srudent can find entertainment enough 
near UCSD - if his idea of fu n is dropping several 
hundred dollars at Banana Republic or an overpriced 
La Jolla boutique. 

Likewise, when it comes to an abstract sense of cen-
trality, UCSD cannot hold its own against its older UC 
cousins. The college system operates like a divide-and-
conquer automaton, isolating and partitioning srudents 
based on fairly arbitrary general education require-
ments, And though UCSD seems destined never to

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Editor: 

After reading Parisa Baharian's 
column in the August edition of 
the GlIo7'dion, I wasn't sure if I 
should be amused or appalled. 
More than anything else, I was 
tempted to think that it was all a 
sick joke, which was, after all, 
prohably the; catalyst to the article 
itself. But besides the fact that J 
was probably some kid with a 
magic marker completing a drunk-
en dare, 1 found the article offen-
sive and naive. 

It is absolutely stomach-turning 
to think' that after chatting with a 
campus shrink, noting a few stats 
and jotting down a few hotline 
phone numbers, Baharian has pro-

. nounced herself on a one-woman 
crusade to save all the kids out 
there who are telling her that 
"voices are telling I them 1 to do bad 
things." 

She seems convinced that the 
rest of us are out there telling peo-
ple to jump off bridges or put bul -
lets in their heads. We are killing 
them with our ignorance, she 
cries. We label the issue as 
unspeakable, she declares. Maybe 
it should be unspeakable if the dia-

logue is at all reminiscent of 
Baharian's plea to "break the 
shackJes of si lence." 

Perha ps the article was wri tten 
with the best of intentions . 
PerhapsJ was/is a victim of ociety. 
And perhaps Baharian is perpenl-
ating the very same stereotypes 
that she condemns-instead of 
looking to empathize with some-
one who is suicidal, she turns it 
into an us versus them struggle of 
having to save those who arc obvi-
ously not right in the head, as evi-
denced by her goi ng to a school 
counselor instead of people who 
had considered the option of 
killing themselves. 

Suicide is obviously 2 serious 
problem and something docs have 
to be done about it. Certainly, 
conversations should be had on 
the issues that would drive some-
one to even joke about taking his 
or her own life, but not if it 
resembles in any way, shape or 
form the holier-than-thou, com-
pletely-rTIlssing-the-point sermon 
of Baharian.

A.S. president's Sept. 11 memorial misses the point 
Brown stresses political agenda' instead of emphasizing mourning and bravery 

By RYAN DARBY 
Senior Stoff Writer 

Shouldn 't a ept . 11 vigil 
remember those who died all ept. 
I I? 

Three thousand Americans died 
that day, and you can bet they'd be 
grieving if it was us trapped inside 
the twin towers instead of them. 
Among the dead were 343 of New 
York's bravest fire-fighters and 
police officers, who rushed into the 
flaming rowers - even seconds 
before they crumbled - prepared 
ro leave everything in this world 
behind to save a few more people, a 
few more of their fellow Americans. 

How, pray tell, would they 
respond to a supposed "memorial 
service" where more time was spent 
condemning America and claiming 
false victimization than remember-
ing innocent lives lost? At UCSD's 
recent Sept. II memorial service, 
A.S. President Jenn Brown did just 
that, and I don't think the true vic-
tims would have appreciated it one 
bit. 

Sure, she acknowledges that the 
thousands of murdered Americans 
- though she did not use the "A-
word," which apparently is offen-
sive to her - were victims. I 
thought that was quite generous of 
her. 

Unfortunately, she spent more 
time lamenting the deaths of those 
lcilled in Afghanistan. But just the 
Afghans, of course; she clearly 

couldn 't care less about the 40 
American servicemen and women 
who have been killed in Operation 
Enduring Freedom. After all, our 
troops were only there to kill a 
bunch of terrorists trying to kill us; 
who cares about our lives or our 
freedom, anyway? Brown obviously 
doesn't. 

We lost 3,000 innocent human 
lives, without warning, in the sick 
name of militant Islamic genocide; 
comparatively, the nation of 
Afghanistan lost a couple hundred 
civilians because of cowardly 
butchers who choose to hide 
among women and children, using 
them as human shields for their 
own protection. 

By attributing Sept. II victim-
ization to "hatred ... a lack of 
understanding ... the power of eco-
nomic interests [and] a general lack 
of tolerance," she criticizes 
American culture. However, I think 
such rhetoric is far more aptly 
applied to those who attacked us. 

Their economic interests are at 
stake not because the United States 
is evil enough to sell them Coca-
Cola and McDonald 's, but because 
rather than teaching their children 
math and science, they teach them 
to hate the United States and blame 
us, on the other side of the world, 
because their civilization has failed 
to advance along wi th the rest of 
civilization. 

Before we invaded Afghanistan, 
women were publicly executed in

soccer fields for wearing makeup. 
Before we invaded Afghanistan, 
television and radio were illegal. 
Before we invaded Afghanistan, 
the foreign aid we provided to the 
suffering masses was stolen by the 
Taliban. 

Before we invaded 
Afghanistan, those masses suf-
fered under a ruthless, fascist 
regime. Although it is sad that 

there may be a recently married 
Afghan couple that won't grow 
old together, the vast majority of 
that nation is far happier now than 
it was a year ago. 

As revolutionary an idea as this 
may be to some, these terrorists 
pervert Islam and use it as a crutch 
because they want the power and 
the money of the United States, 
since their theocratic dictatorships 
are incapable of generating wealth 
on their own. 

Nearly all Americans hate to see 
the loss of human life. But we 
fought a war in Afghanistan in self-
defense; the Sept. II animals waged 
war in the name of ~ate . 

There is a fundamental value 
difference explaining why lives 
were lost in America and in 
Afghanistan; we apologize for the 
loss of innocents , while they 
promise to slaughter more. Anyone 
who doesn't recognize that funda-
mental difference is either stupid or 
even sicker than those malcing such 
promises . 

Brown also characterized Arab-
Americans facing harassment as 
victims of Sept. 11. I have great 
sympathies for anyone facing dis-
crimination on the basis of race or 
religion; I give everyone a ' fair 
shake, and look down upon those 
who do otherwise. Unfortunately, 
despite our nation's progress, there 
are still bigots, and there will 
always be bigots; human thought 
can't be regulated. 

Unlike Brown , however, I 
choose to look at how ~emarkably 
well the strong majority of 
Americans have reacted to Sept. 11 . 
Throughout the histOry of civiliza -
tion, you'll find that the inhabitants 
of nations at war have been out-
wardly and violently hateful toward 
persons whose ethni city would 
apparently ally them with the 
enemy. Yes, there were a few such 
incidents in America following the 
attack, and my heart goes out to the 
victims of such treatment. But I 
prefer to focus on the fact that vio-
lence against Arabs in this country 
has been remarkably low; far lower, 
in fact, than even th greatest opti -
mists would have predicted. 

Would Western European 
nations, whose J?opulaces are bla-
tantly hostile toward non-white 
immigrants, have been so tolerant 
had they been attacked? Certainly 
not. Do you think the Middle East 
is a tolerant place? During the 
strikes, my parents' friend from 
Afghanistan told them that if they 
were in Kabul, he would be expect-
ed to shoot them in the middle of 
the street, and if he didn 't, some-
body else would shoot all three of 
them. If the United States is the 
intolerant, hateful nation Brown 
depicts it to be, then it must sure be 
terrible to be a minority elsewhere 
in the world .

been a lot closer if I didn 't do further 
research on Riverside's mascot and discover 
that their insidious "Highlander" is, in fact, 
just another bear. Naming their bear 
"Highlander" was a clever ploy to challenge 
the Triton's supremacy, but not clever 
enough. 

Next, UCSD has better housing than 
comparable California universities. 

Starting this year, entering freshmen will 
again have a two-year on-campus housing 
guarantee, something that has not existed 

for years at UCB or UCLA. This two-year 
guarantee comes without the sacrifices made 
at other schools to accommodate the incom-
ing class, such as UC Santa Cruz's decision 
to rent out a local hotel for its students or 
UCLAS complete lack of single-occupancy 
rooms on campus. Even Berkeley's suppos-
edly "on-campus" housing leaves much to 
be desired. At Berkeley, the grungy high-rise 
structures used to house first-year students 
are actually located off campus, a few city 
blocks from the university.

deny the positives that such an institution 
would bring to university culture in the way 
of school pride and social gatherings . 
Laclcing the unity of most campuses, social 
life at UCSD is fractured and fragmented, 
forcing students apart into secondary 
school-like cliques as they search for fun . 

Ask any of the more passionate and 
devoted UCSD students what their biggest 
gripe is about their university, and you are 
likely to find the same response: It's just 

impossible to rally people's interest in 
ca uses and commitments. In any given 
week during the quarter, there are dozens 
of cl ub and sports team meetings, projects 
and programs occurring - but rousing 
interest in these activities from students in 
general seems to be like pulling the teeth 
of a lazy student body. The devoted will 
indeed always flock to populate activi ties 
that interest them. However, the propor-
tion of the devoted relative to the universi-

Americans and 
capitalists face 

criticism abroad 
thoughts over 

a pint 
Chris Taylor 

Sca nlon's Pub in Kinnegad , Ireland, is dimly lit and thick with the smell of alcohol - everything from 
strong Stouts and ales to sharp whiskies. 

T he soft mumbles of conversation keep the silence 
away. The husky Irishman across from me drains his 
Guinness and orders another. After his long sip, wip-
ing the foam from hi s upper . lip, he comments on his 
origina l point: "Ah, son, you know all American capi-
talists are greedy businessmen!" 

His son, a rugged, handsome, thirty-something 
Irishman, shakes his head and responds deliberately. 
"You're just sayin' that because you've always been a 
socialist. That's how you were raised." 

His father shakes his head and takes a long swig. 
I've been watching them argue for the last half-

hour about the respective evi ls of capitalism and 
socialism. I assume that my presence is the reason for 
this argument. The first question was aimed at 
me. Despite my attempts at diplomacy, the argument 
proceeded, albeit without any further input from me. 

There is little I can do now, so I keep quiet. 
UCSD told me to expect this sort of argument. It 

is no secret that Ameri cans are looked down upon by 
1Il0st of the world. As a stereotype, we are thought of 
as boi terous , rude, generous bu t spoiled bullies living 
in our fabled lands of freedom , which we think gives 
us the right to tromp around the world unhindered. 

We blame everyone and everything for this stereo-
type . The leftists blame President George W. Bush 
and hi foreign policy. The right-wingers blame the 
morally corrupt world for its inability to cope with the 
last remaining virtuous standards held by 
Americans. Historians may call attention to the fact 
that world powers are always despised, such as the 
Romans and the British . Others bl ame economic fac-
tors or global media forces . Some feel that Americans 
are just evi l - Satans, if you will . 

Regardless of the cause, the stereotype is ever-pre-
sent. Are Americans hopeless in foreign 
countries? Usually not. As with all stereotypes, if an 
individual is given the chance, he may work against it or 
be seen as an exception to the rult, as many students 
o'aveling abroad have. However, most Americans have 
an uphill job to do when visiting foreign culmres.

Fall is upon us once agai n, and with it comes the perpetually increasing freshman cohort that 
descends upon UCSD, espousing tales of how 
involved it was in its high school track team, band or 
- God forbid - newspaper. 

One-third of these precocious youngsters will no 
doubt migrate south for the winter, participating in 
the ritualistic orgies of Tijuana, with their counter-
parts at San Diego St3te University and in the 
Marines. 

The other two-thirds, however, will predictably 
participate in an orgy of their own, downloading 
MP3s of a purely educationa l nature in the public 
domain. These will no doubt include academic dis-
courses by such renowned authors asJ.Lo and Lance 
Bass. But perhaps, like the last three years, UCSD's 
hobbled residential network will prove insufficient 
to handle this activi ty and reduce the Internet traffic 
on campus to a crawl - rendering perfectly valid 
Counter-Strike servers run out of dorm rooms 
unplayable. 

And although ResNet has instructions on its 
Web site detailing the settings students should use 
for their file-sharing software to avoid crippling 
the (a lbeit now upgraded) network, my guess is 
that the crush of freshmen on campus experiencing 
broadband for the first time will force network 
operations to block some file -sharing software 
again (as it did in February 2000 with Napster, 
making national news with a number of oth er cam-
puses). 

The ungrateful freshmen will probably be peev-
ed, but they shou ld feel lucky in comparison to the 
Net denizens of China, who must deal wi til Google 
being blocked (and then unblocked, with political-
ly subversive search terms still restricted). A list of 
blocked sites at bttp:llcode.law.bardvard.edulfilter-
i71gllist.btml reveals that the Web si tes of upstand-
ing science and enginee ring schools, such as 
Georgia Tech, MIT and Cal Tech, are occasionally 
or always restricted from access. However, in spite 
of all our success as an engineering university, 
UCSD apparently has yet to make the short list; 
the Chinese seem to think that our Web site is

Whining pays off in admissions 
Students' misfourtunes should not get them in 

By DumN, FRELICH 
Contributing Writer 

How did you get into UCSD? 
Was it a high SAT score? A high 
GPA? Because you live in a onc-
parent ho usehold? Or maybe 
because you had a death in the fam-
ily during high school ? 

I f you chose one of the first two 
choices, you may be parr of a dying 
breed chosen for admission to UC 
tampuses. 

The UC system has decided to 
circumvent the abolition of what 
California voters declared forbid-
den in 1996: affi rmative action. 

For those of you not familiar 
with affirmative action, its core 
underlying philosophy is the pref-
erence of one group of people over 
another on the basis of race. T he 
University of Ca liforn ia's jaded new 
policy is the haphazardly disguised 
reinstatement of the fa llen affirma-
tive action law. 

So how does it work? Well , it's 
rather simple. Admittance to UC 
schools can be thought of as based 
on points, with more points giving 
you an edge over other potential 
stu dents in the admissions 
process. 

Traditionally, points have been 
awarded to students based on acad-
emic merit, such as a high GPA or 
high test scores. Nevertheless, with 
new admissions policies, a student 
can earn pointS t hrough very

nonacademic means. 

According to John Leo of U.s. 
Nrws lind World Report these 
"opportunities" include "personal 
struggle" and "difficult personal 
and family situations or circum-
stances" - wholly arbitrary means 
of admission. 

Points can also come a student's 
way jf he or she has to "overcome a 

physical handicap, needed to work 
after school, was fired or down-
sized at work, lives in a single-par-
ent or low-income home, or comes 
from a family in which neither par-
ent went to high school," just to 
name a few. 

\Vhat it comes down to is the 
preference of one group over 
anotller. [n this case, there is a clear 
preference toward inner-city chil-
dren by means of default, si nce they 
are the ones more likely to grow up 
in single-parent households, have 
both parents not complete high 
school and have other hard-luck 
stories. 

So the next time someone tells 
you you r fam ily is messed up, tell 
them, "Hey, they're getting me into 
college." 

What this is teaching kids is dis-
astrous. In esse nce, the more 
screwed up you and your family 
are, the better fi t YOll are to go off 
to one of the best coll ege systems in 
the entire United States: the UC 
system. 

Any way you dress it up -
whether it's described as a race 
issue, a class issue (poor vs. rich) or 
any other preferred pseudonym -
it's sti ll preferential treatment sanc-
tioned by the University of 
California .

Best: Party,filled social life 
is easy to attain at UCSD 

continued from page A6 
Looking for partics? Look no 

further than U SO. Okay, look a 
little bit further -look off campus. 
UCSO's Greeks throw parries all 
the time. So does every other orga-
nization, from Student Run 
Televi sion to the College 
Republicans to the MO. Sign up for 
the clubs, get on 20 e-mail lists, and 
you'll be up to date on everything. 

UCSO is the only UC campus 
within easy reach of another coun-
try. You can satisfy your culrural 
yearnings by vis iting Ensenada, 
about 70 miles across the Mexican 
border. Or you can visit a twi sted 
parody of Mexico via the bus that 

leaves the Sun God every 
Wednesday night for Tijuana . 

Fi nally, UCSO's spons team; 
are the best. In sports with which 
I'm familiar, we do phenomenally 
well. SpOrts like soccer: After 
recently moving to Division II , 
we've won the wOlnen's soccer 
championships every year. 

Clearly, it is folly to argue agumst 
UCSO's greatness. Lea vi ng nothing 
to chance, we've decided to become 
the best in eve/ything. Our mighty 
Triton smites all our enemies, simul-
taneously building more on-campus 
housing and keeping our crime rate 
low while the soccer players bring 
home nice, shiny rrophies. 

Our oriemaoon leaders don't lie ; 

Brown: President claims 
she herself is a 9/11 victim 

continued from page A6 
about Brown's speech, however, is 
her claim that leftists whose radical 
views are scoffed by the ~ajority of 
Ame ricans are also victims of Sept. 
11, because they're "called un-
American because they question 
their government." T herefore, our 
elected A.S. president, who has 
total ly lambasted our nation in the 
past, is, in a speech remembering 
victims of Sept. 11 , claiming vic-
timization herself. 

Who is she to think she's exempt 
fro m criticism? I f she and her frie nds 
share a view that the vast majority of 
this counrry thi nks is ridiculous, why 
is she so surprised when people are 
eager to criticiz.e her' 

Moreover, by calling hersel f a 
\~ctim, she disgraces the true vic-
tims of that terrible day. She's still 
alive. As far as J know, she didn't 
have to grieve the loss of any loved 
ones, or attend a single funeral void 
of a casket. She lives nowhere near 
Manhattan. Or the Pentagon. Or 

Shanksvi ll e, Pa. She didn't rush into 
the World j radc Center to rescut: ~ 
singlc soul before its collapse, nor 
does she seem to care that anyone 
did. It is an outrage that she could 
possibly have the audacity, or even 
the ego, to merely entertain the 
possibil ity that she is a victim. 

If she thinks she's a victim, 
maybe she should have attended the 
recent mcmorial service at Ground 
Zero and shared her sad, sulking 
speech of victimization with a 
crowd of thousands who~c friend~ 
and loved ones had perished vio-
le ntly and senselessly. I ~us pc<: t 
they'd te ll her "thanks btlt no 
thanks," and, with absolutely all due 
respect, tell her where to shove it. 

T he peoplc who attended 
UCSO's service expected better 
than the speech she del ivercd. T he 
famil ies of those who died, as well 
as our brave servicemen and 
women, would have wanted better 
than that. And there are 3,000 dead 
Americans whose memory deserves 
better than that. 

Horse: Bikers in need get 
nothing from Parking Services 

continued from page A7 
innocllous. 

Maybe that's because our under-
graduates spend their ti me playing 
COllntcr-Stri ke and downloading 
music (as opposed to wiring their 
dorms to check on the starus of their 
laundry machines from the Internet 
like Cal Tech and M IT do - maybe 
electronically enabled washers and 
dryer arc politically subversive). If 
it's any consolation, UCLA is not 
bl ocked either. Then aga in, we don't 
have Noam Chomsky, ei ther. 

As much as Transportation and Parking Services' new 
"Cityshmrle" serving the va rious 
apartment complexes along Gilman 
Drive and Nobel Drive will be 
apprecia ted, one must note the 
duplication of some effort: City bus 
lines 34 and 41 already serve the 
proscribed area e'{ery half hour, as 
well as several stops in UCSD . All 
things equal, it seems likely that 
while students who formerly dealt 
with the vagaries of the city bus sys-
tem will now have a more palatable 
alternative, those who drove three 
blocks to school to park in Regents 
lot and bus in will be little swayed 
from their current patterns. 

Perhaps, if the new shuttle system 
is a success, parking problems could 
be al leviated not only by forcing 
freshmen to park in the outlaying lots 
during the day, but also by restricting 
parking pennit purchases to those 
who can demonstrate residence out-
side of a reasonable bussinglbiking 
radius, as well as improving the atro-
cious on-campus bilcing situation to 

encourage more people to do so. In 
fac t, the I ovember 2001 report of 
the lhnsportation Poli cy 
Committee recolllmended to 
"improve north-south and east-wcst 
bike connections, and install addi-
tional bi ke racks." And, in spite of 
th is recommendation and shorter 
passing periods, stlJdents this fall will 
look forward to violating all average 
of eight signs and nearly mowing 
down four pcdesrrians ill order to get 
from class to cla 's on time by bicycle. 

And ill world news (besides Iraq), th ere was a Wor ld 
Summit in August that Mr. Blish

able development (a doublethink 
term that the current administra-

"burning coal") when there is Iraq 
to be dealt with' The timing of the 
administration 's unilateral push 
for an attack on Iraq to coincide 
with a hi gh-profil e summit meant 
to force the world's largest econo-

T IS A YWAYTO RU T E 
"TOP PUBLIC" U IV SITY? 

A message to the UCSD Community from UCSD Lecturers, 
Clericals and Professional/Technical elnployees. 

Coalition of Union Employees (CUE) 
* Labor Relations at UCSD prevents UC from bargaining with CUE on 

our campus, making it difficult for members to attend. 
* UC has prematurely cut off bargaining with CUE. 
* UC lays off temporary clericals one month before they become per-

manent employees .... then rehires them as temps again. 
* UC has threatened CUE that if we don't take their current proposal , 

they'll put something worse on the bargaining table. 
* UC Administration intimidates employees from exercising their lawful 

rights in protesting the University'S unfair labor practices as union 
members. 

* UC's insulting wage offer is 1.5% and it hasn't changed since 9/01. 
* UC claims that our salaries are on a par with other clerical salaries -

we are actually 15% lower than the commerical sector. 
* UC says it's funds are restricted but won't produce documentation 

supporting that claim. UC currently has $2.9 billion in unrestricted 
funds according to forensic ec<?nomist. Peter Donohue! 

* UC won't bargain merits! 
... UC bargains in bad faith - with many Labor Law violations. 
... UC distorts the union's intentions and actions - we are not the villains 

here, we are the wronged! 
* Clerical turnover at UC is 50% in the first year (and with our wages it 

should be no surprise!) We want a fair living wage for our people. 
(619) 296-4937 http://www,cueunion.orgl . 

University Professional and Technical Employees -
CWA 9119 
UC reneged on it promi ses and put forw ard a proposal worse than the 
already un acceptable package they previously had on the table: 
... Multiple year wage agreement 
... Spend all wage money UC receives on our increases 
... Step increases not subject to manipuhition 
* Expanded ranges for topped out employees 
... No more abuse of floater employees 
... Job security improvements 
... Other contract language improvements UC has already agreed to for 

other employees 

Going in to bargaining UC conceptually agreed to these goals. 

University Council/AFT Loca! 2034 Lecturers and other 
titles in Unit 18 
* In the current system there is no accountability for yearly re-hiring of 

lecturers during our first 6 years at the University. We need clear and 
consistent re-hiring policies and practices! 

... Post 6-year non-senate faculty are not treated like career employees -
we have to re-apply for our job every 3 years. We need career status as 
lecturers like other employees of UC! 

* The merit system is unclearly defined and applied. We need a merit 
review every two years with reasonable criteria and appeals proce-
dures! 

* The existing Salary Range is applied arbitrarily and often unfairly. We 
need a Salary Scale to bring consistency and fairness! 

* Our workload at the University, outside of the classroom, is unrecog-
nized. Our time needs to be recognized by inclusion in the Workload 
Article! 

* Professional Development: At a "World Class" University, we need 
support for professional development opportunities such as support for 
attending conferences. 

* Instructional Support: Some of us don ' t have an office or equipment 
needed to do our job. We need better access to computers, offices, 
telephones, and supplies. 

* When we get a new contract, we need its provisions to be arbitrable so 
that there can be a fair and enforceable' hearing of our grievances. 

(858) 449-8429 http://www.cft.orgluc-afU 

However, at the last bargaining session (at San Diego) UC reneged on all 
these goals and actually put forward a proposal worse than the alread 
horrible proposal they had previously had on the table. UPTE's 
statewide response: 
* We call on all employees to partic ipate in protests and other actions 
... We have requested audits from state and federal legislators to invesli -

gate where UC diverts funds intended for our wages . 
* We are filing unfair labor practice charges with the Public Employment 

Relations Board 
* We have refused UC's request to temporarily extend our contracts, so 

UC must now negotiate every major change to work rules and staffing. 
(n addition, UC must now pay cash for overtime instead of impos ing' 
CompTime.' 

(619) 296-5090 http://www,upte.org 

The Union Coalition at U.C strongly supports each other's bargaining efforts and invites the UCSD community to a 

Noon Rally on Wednesday, October 2nd at the Library Walk Price Center fountain.

AIO OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24 , 2002 

Nostalgia for childh.ood is comforting Worst: SO's pretensions belie 
disorganization College students should reflect on a simpler time in their lives 

8y EVELYN HSIEH 
Contributing Writer 

turned 19 recently. Among 
the common sprinklings of 
"HapJlY BIrthday'" and "It's your 
bi rthday'" were statements like, 
"Treasure your last year as a teen!" 
and the more blunt, "Wow, you're 
old." Not even two decades into 
Illy hfe and I was already being 
labeled an old-timer. 

moil and angst it Ia 
"Dawson's Creek" 
lay the same inno-
cence, only trans-
formed . In other 
words, we still had 
bits and pieces of a 
childlike mentality 
within us. T he 
world's problems 
were not entirely 
ours, and although 
we had much 

on the cusp of getting married , 
getting a job and getting a family. 
"That's far off," )'ou may say. But

is that time fl ies, and the future is 
comi ng at us like a runaway train.

parate' If a university is only 
worth as much as its least active 
student, then there are probably 
thousands of reasons why UCSD 
scrapes the bottom ' of the 
University of California barrel. 

All this got me thinking: What 
had I done with Illy life' What 
happened to the simplicity of years 
gone by? Why did I feel like I was 
still so young' I started reminisc-
ing and harkening back to the 
good 01' days . Rememberi ng 
childhood and even high school 
years shows how much things 
change, spiked by acceleration into 
adulthood when we reach college. 
I nnocence is so underrated . 

lives was delightful-
ly carefree. Mr. 
Rogers wOldd coax 
us to be neighborly, 
and Barney was JUSt 
a friendly purple 
dino aUf instead of 
an annoying . and 
eerily large plush 
tOy. The innocence 
of those days con-
trasts sharply with 
how everything is 
now. It is only nat-
ural tha t we grow 
up; the shame is in 
that with experience 
comes a certain cyn-
icism and corrupt-
ibility that only 
humans can muster 
and maintain. 

COMMENTARY more on our plate, 
we were still Icjds 

T he other day, my roommate 
was playing music from Disney am-
mated movies. I don 't think hearing 
a supposedly animated character 
sing had ever made me so emotion-
al. For some reason, those some-
what cheesy tunes conjured in me a 
longing to smile and cry at the same 
time. Jasmine and Ariel were 
touching my inner child. Ironically, 
my roommate had it all stored in 
her MP3 file list. It was a fitting 
paradox: Something so embedded 
in our fond memories protruding 
from a technology that only recent-
ly was assimilated into our lives. 

But what would ever justify 
anybody in saying that UCSD is 
indeed worse than the University 
of California at lrvine or the 
University of California at 
Riverside in so me ways) 
Unfortunately, the answer lies in 
UCSDs hit-and-miss existence . It 
tries so hard to be the best UC 
campus that its growth becomes 
distorted, misapplied, flailing in all 
directions . The result is a disparity 
berween what UCSD promises to 
be - an upper-echelon campus -
and what it is: the runt younger 
brother straggling in its quest to be 
like its grown-up brethren cam-
puses . UC Irvine and UC 
Riverside put on no such airs, 
existing for what they are: a cam-
pus situated in a place that looks 
eerily like it came right out of 
"Brave New World," and one 
cholcjng in its own smog and heat, 
respectively. 

" 

In kindergarten, when our most 
consuming problem was getting 
glue off our fingers, everything was 
just so pure, including our mind-
sets. For me, "Sesame Street" was 
the highlight of my day. Bert and 
Ernie held the same starure usually 
reserved for rock idols. Not to 
sound like a teary-eyed nostalgic, 
bm I miss those days - the days 
when everyone was your friend (or 
at least it seemed so), the sandbox 
was the neighb orhood hango ut 
and trees were smiling Everests 
beckoning to be climbed and 
explored. We actually wanted to be 
with our parents at all times, 
which, a decade later, would devel-
op into a scorn rivaled only by our 
distaste for final exams. 

Granted, when 
we hit the teenage 
years, our once-
pure mindsets all

In kindergarten,

was getting glue off

in a way. Do you 
remember the pil-
low fights at sleep-
overs and night 
runs to Jack in the 
Box' Braces and 
prom dresses and 
homecoming 
games - all were 
integral to our 
memory as teens. 

I don't bring 
up these moments 
merely to remi-
nisce. By reflect-
ing, you can see 

While it is never particularly 
healthy to dwell in the past, those 
comments from birthday well-
wishers made me think (and also 
instilled in me a need to run to a 
playground). Not to advocate 
escapism, but would it be such a 
bad thing to sit on a swing again 
and forget about everything for a 
bit' How worry-free and silly life 
once was. It would be good to not 
sink into a defeated mindset and 
relive youthful memories with all 
the meticulous detail of a Civil 
War battle reenactment, but to just 
sit back and enjoy the moment. 
Youth is a phase and a mentality.

In hindsight, this station in our 

• • 

gave way to Swm Vlllley High and 
then Sports [Jlustrated, Seventeen, 
Cosmopolitan, Maxim, and who 
knows what else. Adolescence is a 
strange time - what exactly is 
inherent in us that makes school-
girl Britney wa~t to turn into sul-
try Britney? There began to be 
some appeal in being "not that 
innocent." Hormones began to 
work at full speed, and cooties 
became a thing of the past. 

Still , amid all this seeming tur-

the many facets 
and factors of how the young 

. adult you see in the mirror came 
to be. I sometimes wish that we 
could go back to the days when 
"pot" was a cooking receptacle, 
and "malcjng money" meant set-
ting up a lemonade stand . Back 
then, bicycles were th e pr/fferred 
transportation of choice, and sing-
a-longs were the norm and not 
restricted only to rowdy drunk-
ards at a party. It is almost fright-
ening to realize that most of us are 

Nineteen years old' Ha! 
Nineteen years young. Now if 
you'll excuse me, I have a sudden 
urge to run to La Jolla Shores and 
make snow angels in the sand. 

Unfortunately, it appears that in 
many ways, becoming the 
University of California's pride and 
joy is just not in the cards for 
UCSD. Saddled with a location 
that will never support a college 
town and academic departments 
that nlll the gamut from the very 
best to the mediocre, UCSD may 
just continue to flail in all direc-
tions yet without any direction -
marlcjng it as being far from the top 
of the heap.

TUESI)AY. SEPTEMBER 24, 1002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION All 



AI! nPINlnN THE U D GUARDIAN TUESDAY. SEPTEMBER 24. 2002 

Admissions: Unfair UC 
policy lacks consistency 

Pint: Baseless stereotypes about Americans 
are found here in the states as well 

,'unllnttd fro m page A7 
pll:lC opposi te:: of equality, some-
thmg 1'111 sure the policy is 
enforccJ 111 the name of. In a 
nation where just a bout every-
hod)' ilgrees that the preference of 
Jnl' group of people over any 
other I, considered immoral and 
downright evil. whcn it comes to 
the poor and res idents of inner-
city .lreas (mostly minorities), 
why do we throw consistency to 
the wi nd, thinking no one will 

notice~ 
In any way, shape or form, the 

taki ng into account' of race or any 
other OOOOOOOOpreference is not 
only wrong, it's diminutive, causing 
tho,e students who enter college 
on this free ticket to question the 
validity of thei r being on campus. 

In essence, the University of 
Californ ia is saying that without 
its help, some groups of people 
are des tined not to go to college. 
How dare they? The greatest 
thing it can do is set an example, 
tear down its spurious policies 
and let everyone know dley are 
once again accepting students on 
merit, not special circumstances ' 
that have nothing to do with an 
applicant's academic abili ty. 

What th is policy also means is 
that 111 a school system where 
there are a limited number of 
openings, some more qualifie d 
students ~He bei ng pushed out of 
the way in favo r of students with 
sob stOries. 

' Nhy should a decidi ng factor 
for any tudent be anything but 
academic merit? Just like exclud-
mg anyone on the basis of race is 
wrong, includi ng anyone on the 
ba is of race. hardshi ps, personal 
, tones or a handicap is wrong. 

C'mon, fo lks, ler's be consistent 
here. 

T he UC system ha hit a new ' 
low - in effect, admi tting those 
snlde nts who complain the most, 
creating the most maudlin tale. 
Meanwhile, the policy is complet-
Iy disregarding a snldent's acade-
mic meri r. 

However, th is i n't just a UC 
probl em. Schools nationwide are 
trying to sneak in affirmative 
action pol icies right under our 
noses. 

"The University of Texas," 
Leo wrote, " is also reservi ng 
scholarships for graduates of 130 
state high school s that have tradi -
tionally not sent many students to 
the campus." 

So just because students from 
your particular high school hap-
pen to not find themselves at 
UC campuses - bingo, you're 
in ! 

Putting the tame admission 
policies of both UC and UT 
schools to shame, the University 
of Michigan takes the cake -
heck, they take the whole bak-
ery. They al armingly give six 
times the number of points to a 
student for simply belonging to 
a minority (whatever that means) 
than for a good essay, and just 
under doubl e the points than 
what is given for a perfect SAT 
score ! 

We must stop this reverse di s-
crimination and the message it 
se nds to college tudents: Hard 
work is not the way to success, a 
ob story is. Besides, who wants to 

be cheaply and fal sely awarded 
a dmjttance~ We used to look at 
scholastic work as measuring a 
stud ent 's capabilities. Now it's 
"politically incorrect."

mered into us by our own institu-
ti ons of learning. We are taught 
incessa ntly that stereoryping is 
bad. Stereotyping translates direct-
ly to racism, which is our society's 
unforgivabl e sin . However, many 
students immediately discuss the 
American stereotype to criticize 
Americans. If you haven't heard 
this argument before, you've been 
taking too many organic chemistry 
classes. But most of you know what 
I'm talking about: 

"Americans all go ruining other 
countries through forcing depen-
dence on American tourism .. . and 
then they disrespect and consequent-
ly destroy long-surviving cu.lnlTcs!" 

When I hear this or something 
like it, I immediately reton that 
one shouldn't hold such a scathing 
stereotype of all U .S. 
travelers. Then I get a barrage of 
widely diverse backtracking 
defenses: 

"Well, most of them l You can 
always stereotype if it's the vast 
majority!" . 

" I'm not stereotyping. That's 
how it iSI" 

"I 'm American . So I can stereo-
type my own people." 

"So what? I shouldn't say 
Americans suck? They do!" 

Or the exquisite Voz Frontrriza 
answer, paraphrased: "We're 
oppressed people, so we are justi-
fied in our stereotypes and racism!" 

It's just amazing to me that with-
in American collegiate culture, in 
which we are held to such rigorous 
standards of insane political correct-
ness, we are so hopeless to break the 
bonds of our stereotype in our own

universlOes. Oftt'n, foreigners are 
more forgiving than our own peers. 

Perhaps professors feel that 
most students haven't heard of this 
stereotype before and need to 
enlighten them to our foreign 
image . Perhaps the protest groups 
feel that students aren 't completely 
aware of our inherent evil. If either 
of these are the case, then why are 
individuals still held to such a sting-
ing generalization? If you haven't 
felt this individual accountabil ity to 
be a rude American, just go to a

protest table and te ll them that you 
aren't the typical American . 

The greatest example was last 
year's article in the NfW Indicator 
about the inherent racism of a 
white student. If you don't remem-
ber, the New lrulicator published a 
delightfully unforgiving quiz that 
allowed us lucky white students (it's 
our fault for being white, remem-
ber?) to gauge our racism. Was 
there a category for "not-

racist~" No, in fact, the article went 
out of its way to reassure us that all 
white students are racist to a degree 
and need counseling. 

Resigned and somewhat indig-
nant, I realized that if students at 

UCSD are thi s harsh to their own 
peers about race, certainly the 
countries renown for thei r resent-
ment of Americans in general must 
be far worse! 

After about five minutes, the 
argument in the pub fades away and 
the talk turns towards matters of 
more upbeat nature. Already the 
contempt is gone. 

Am I still American to the 
Irish? Yes. Am I still a 
capitalist? Yes. But am I hated? Not 
at all. It turns out that some people 
have the capability to be forgiving 
of stereotypes and are able to judge 
people based on the quality of their 
cha racter, as opposed to the 'place 
of thcir upbri nging. Too bad it's not 
our ever-loving, ever-supportive 
schoolmates. 

Do many Americans uphold this 
awful stereotype with their 
actions? Yes. Do all? Nu. Can 
Americans avoid having their unfor-
tunate stereotype pounded into 
their hearts sans hope of redemp-
tion? Yes, bllt we'll have to leave our 
colleges and universities. Can we 
survive foreign countric without 
the same barrage of insults that arc 
inflicted upon u wi th the sa me 
ferocity of racism? 

After we say goodnight, the 
younger Irishman pauses to say dlat 
as Americans go, especially ca pital-
ists, I'm all right with him. Similar 
stories are given to me by Americans 
sttldents . Poiacld , Russia, 
Germany and Spain . I guess we 
aren 't as hopeless as we were told. 

It begins to rain. The night is 
cold and dreary and the clouds arc 
covering the emire sky, but I think 
I love this fa scinating culture. I'm 
beginning to think that I won 't be 
judged entirely based on Illy birth-
place and upbringing.

California budget puts UC funds in question 
Gov. Gray Davis to make an additional budget cut of $96 million 

Homeland: 
Researchers 

contribute to 
national eft rt By EVAN MCLAUGHLIN 

News Editor 

While California's state budget 
was signed into effect Sept. 5, 
uncertainty continues to loom for 
the UC system because a provision 
in the agreement calls for Gov. 
Gray Davis to make up to an addi-
tional $750 million in funding 
cuts. 

The decision to add a section 
into Assembly Bill 425 , giving the 
governor authority to slash state 
funding by January 2003, was a 
last-minute bargaining tool to 
help resolve a partisan confl ict 
that had made little headway 
since the budget bill was intro-
duced to the assembly. The bud-
get bill had been in gridlock for 
more than two months past the 
June 30 dead line for passage se t 
by the California state cOl1Sti tu-
tion . 

In a statement to un iversity 
employees, UC President Richard 
C. Atkinson estimated that indi-
vidual state agencies could see 
their funding cut by an additional 
5 percent when Davis makes his 
reductions. However, the gover-
nor's office officials say that Davis 

New beer 
marketed 
to health--

• conscIous 
Lager will have 
less than half 

the carbs found 
in light beers 
By LINDSAY POHLMAN 

IOWA STATE DAILY (IOWA STATE U.) 
(U-WIRE) AMES, Iowa -

Those infamous beer guts may be 
a thing of the past if a new prod-
uct from Anheuser-Busch sells 
well. 

The company will be releasing 
a new product, Michelob Ultra, 
later this month. The new beer is 
low in carbohydrates and could be 
of particular in terest to health-
conscious coll ege students. 

"Michelob U ltra is a smooth, 
refreshing lager with 96 calories, 
4.1 percent alcohol by volume and 
2.9 grams of carbohydrates per 12-
ounce servi ng," according to 
Anheuser- Busch's Web site. 

Light beers like Bud Light can 
have up to 6.6 grams of carbohy-
drates per serving, while Michelob 
Ultra has 3.7 fewe r grams of car-
bohydrates. 

Ma rk Love, an Iowa State 
University associate professor in 
food science and human nutri-
tion, said he doesn 't know if there 
will be a benefit to drinking the 
low- carhohydrate, low-calorie 
beer. 

"[There is a) movement in the 
marketplace for people to move 
toward foods that are in line with 
the Atkins [low-carbohydrate) 
diet," he said. "That's the rage diet 
that's out there right now." 

When light beer became popu-
lar because of the reduced calorie 
conte nt, Love said it made people 
fee l like they eould drink two beers 
instead of one. 

"[Micht lob Ultra) might be 
popular with college stude nts," he 
said . "Now studen~ will think thty 
can h avt four. You can get drunk 
without all the calories." 

has asked agencies to prepare a 
scenario where 20 percent was cut 
out. 

"We are working with agencies 
to get a' better idea of where the 
governor can make additional 
cuts," said Hilary McLean, 
spokesperson for Davis. 
"Everything is in review and noth-
ing is set in stone yet." 

Democ rats had pushed for 
both a vehicle registration fee and 
an additional tobacco tax to com-
pensate for this year's shortfall so 
that funding cuts would not be as 
drastic. However, Republicans 
were more supportive of spending 
cuts than levying new taxes for 
additional revenue, and the two 
initiatives failed on the assembly 
floor. 

Davis was more successful in 
propos ing a solution to generate 
state funds . Net operating losses 
for California businesses, nor-
mally written off in taxes, will be 
deferred for t he next two years 
so tha t the sta te ca n restore 
funding to state programs and 
agencies. 

Meanwhile, there are no dras-
tic changes to the UC budget in its 
signed version since the Senate's 

revision in late Junc. The 10 per-
cent, $32 million c ut to UC 
research was made, as was the $10 
million slashed frolll the Internet2 
expansion project and the one-
time $29 million reduction to 
libraries, equipment and instruc-
tional technology. 

The projected cuts to outreach 
programs were also made. In net 
reductions, $7 .6 million was cut 
from UC outreach, with 
AmBridge losing $ 1.2 million in 
funding. The K-12 School-
University Partnership will see a 
$9 million decrease from last year, 
despite receiving a cushion from 
revenue generated by a 6 percent 
increase in nonresident under-
graduate fee increase designed 
specifically to preserve the pro-
gram. 

The university'S teacher devel-
opment programs were cut by' 
$56.9 mill ion, but university offi-
cials insist that some of those 
monies can be restored through 
other federal and state funds. 

The University of California 
was able to uphold its funding 
increase for 7,700 additional stu-
dents in the 2002-03 school year, 
while also being granted funding 

for a I. 5 percent merit increase in 
salaried for eligible facul ty and 
staff. 

While the budget resembles 
versions of Al3 425 made earlier in 
the summer, UC officials are skep-
tical as to how much of the univer-
sity'S funding will be maintained 
after Davis' cuts. 

"We expected to be impacted 
in some way, but we have no idea 
as to how much more will be cut 
or when," said UC spokesman 
Brad Hayward. "We are going to 
be working very hard with the 
state to make minimal cuts, but 
there is still a lot of uncertainty 
surrounding the si tuarion." 

UCSD budget officials echoed 
Hayward's thoughts of uncertain-
ty. 

"We have a pretty idea of what 
our budget looks like for the next 
year," said Sylvia Lepe-Askari, 
associate budget director at 
UCSD, regarding the campus 
budget. which is due to be released 
in the next few weeks . 

"But then again, so many 
changes have been made in this 
year's process," she said. "We're 
not expecting things to stay the 
saIne."

When evaluating the response

When considering the over-

Future plans: The new Joan and liwin Jacobs Center for La Jolla Playhouse will include a state of the art theater with flexible 
seating and design configurations that will give audience members a different experience each time they enter. 

La Jolla Playhouse's $32 miliion 
expansion set for construction 

Jacobs Center will host world premiers while doubling 
as workspace for Department of Theatre and Dance

Staff Writer 

The award-winning L~ Jolla 
Pbvhousc, located on the UCSD 
C'1I11PUS, an nounced the com-
mencement of a $32 mi ll ion con-
structi on project that wil! be 
named after the gift'S benefactors, 
Joan and Irwin Jacobs. 

The 0+5 ,000 sl]uare-foot com-
plex will consist of a brand-new 
theater, a pl ay development ce nter, 
an educauon complex and a restau-
rant/caba ret. 

" I ca nnot exaggera re the impact 
tim new buildlllg complex wi ll 
have on San Diego," said Des 
,' IcAnuIT, two-time l (my Award 
winner and artistic di rector of the 
playhouse. 

T he La Joll a Plnyhouse is a 
nonprotit profe sional theater. It 
was founded in 1947 by Gregory 
Peck, Dorothy McGuire and Mel 
Ferrer, and was revi ved in 1983 
under the leadership of Des 
McAnuff. 

T he pl ayhouse currently shares 
its fac ili ties with the professional 
train ing program of the UCSD 
Department of Theatre and 
Dance, which is nacionally- ranked 
in the top three of its category. 

" I t is vital that we, as profes-
sionals, continue to work side-by-
side with young artists, " McAnuff 
said. "Due to our passionate com-
mitment to the training and devel-
opment of theater students, it 
stands to reason that we need' more 
space than the average theater 
organization. For the last 20 years, 
we've had considerably less." 

The original La Jolla Playhouse 
has experienced a great deal of suc-
cess over the years. Of the 107 
plays and musicals produced by the 
playhouse since its revival in 1983, 
almost 40 percent have been world 
premieres. Over a third of them 
have moved on to other theaters, 
from those on Broadway to inter-
national ones. 

The playhouse's productions of 
both plays and musicals have mer-
ited over 300 major honors, includ-
ing the 1993 Tony Award for 
America's Outstanding Regional 
Theatre . 

"Thoroughly Modern Millie," 
which premiered Cit the playhouse 
in 2000, became the first show crc-
ated at an American regional the-
ater west of the Hudson River to 
wi n th e Tony Award for Best 
Musical. 

"The playhouse plays a unique 
cul tural role locally and national -
ly," said Irwin Jacobs, a primary 
contributor to thc campaign and 
one of the namesakes of the new 
playhouse. 

Courtesy of La Jolla Playhouse 

Breaking ground: Plans for the new gr9unds at the Joan and \iwin Jacobs Center for 
La Jolla playhouse indude a new theater, a play development center and a restaurant. 

"For us, it joins with San 
Diego's other world -class arts insti -
llitions in making our city one of 
America's major cultural destina-
tions," Irwin Jacobs said . "Equally 
important, it further consolidates 
UCSD's conneccion to the play-
house and creates an environment 
where local , national and interna-
tional theater artists will converge 
to create bold, compelling theater 
for San Diego audiences." 

During the last theater season, 
the playhouse attracted over 

" The new complex is a 
completion of a dream 

we at the playhouse have 
had for 20 years. " 
- Des McAnuff,.La JoIa 
~.tis1k dnc:tor 

170,000 people. Mainsuge pro-
ductions were attended by 120,000 
of those patrons, while an addition-
al 50,000 participated in the play-
house's education and outreach 
programs, including 40,000 stu-
dents who enjoyed playhouse pro-
grams in schools throughout San 
Diego and Imperial Counties and 
Mexico\; border regions. 

"I think the addition of a new 
theater is a very excicing thing for 
this area," said AJissa Nadel, a Muir 
junior. "However, as a part of 
UCSD, I believe that the theater 
should be student-friendly, and 
student issues, especially parking, 
should be taken into consideration. 

With more peopl e being atu'ac ted 
to our campus, the students C~lIl 't 
be driven out." 

The pl ayhouse 's Ca pital 
Campaign is attempting to meet 
the objectives of thc tirst long-
range plan that the original theater 
fashioned in 1997, including spacc 
issues and financial stability. The 
campaign's goal of $36 million, 
once met, will be distributed 
among thc construccion of the new 
building, an endowment and the 
funds necessary for its annual 
operation. 

In addition to Joan and Irwin 
Jacobs, other major contributors 
to the building include The 
Hughes and Sheila Potiker Family 
Foundation, the Audrey 
GeiseVDr. Seuss Foundation and 
the county of San Diego. 

Joel Holliday, chairman of the 
board of trustees, is enthusiastic 
about the implications of the new 
playhouse. 

"This is a stunning time for San 
Diego theater and La Jolla 
Playhouse," Holliday said. "This 
year, San Diegans will be' able to 
experience five world premieres at 
the playhouse, which gives all of us 
bragging rights to say, 'I saw it in 
San Diego first .'" 

Plays produced at the play-
house this season include 
Thornton Wilder's Pulitzer Prize-
winning "Our Town," Michael 
Ondaatje's "The Collected Works 
of Billy the Kid," and the celebrat-
ed New York hit "The Laramie 
Project." 

"The new complex is the COI11-
pletion of a dream we at the play-
house have had for 20 yea rs," 
McAnuff said . "Theater in San 
Diego has never been brighter."

UCSA congress 
sets agenda 

9/11 : A.S. and GSA present tribute gift 

VP External Klass elected to chair 
systemwide student coalition 
By LAURA McGANN 
Associate News Editor 

Three members of the UCSD 
AS Council attended the 
Unlversiry of California Student 
.-\ssociation 's annual congress in 
August, at which the yearlong 
action agenda was set. 

UCSA is a student coalition that 
aims to serve the interests of UC 
students and to promote coopera-
tion betwee n universiry student 
governments and student organiza-
tions concerned with hi gher educa-
tion . It is also consi lered by the 
UC Regents to be the voice of stu-
dents, represented at the regents' 
meetings by the UCSA chair. 

T he new chair, A.S. Vice 
President External Steven Klass, 
was elected at the congress in 
August. 

UCSA has set three action 
agenda items in place for this year. 

r\ votcr registration campaign will 
be run in conjunction with Yourh 
Vote, a campaign run by a coalition 
of po li tical student groups that 
seeks to increase student vming. 
UCSA is interested in increasing 
student voting numbers to height-
en the standing of student issues 
within government. 

"The problem with stu lents not 
voting is that even though there are 
2 million students, politicians do 
not listen to people who do not 
vote," Klass said. 

UCSA will also be hc:ading a 
"no on information ban" campaign, 
which will provide information on 
why to vme against the Raci .d 
Privacy In itiarive on ballms in 
March of 2004. The initiative, if 
passed , would remove all racial 
information frolll admissions mate-
rials to the university.

came of age one year ago, when 
thev saw 19 terrorists take the 
lives of thousamls of innocent 
people," Dynes said. 

Attending the ceremony were 
members of the UCSD police 
department, students, faculty and 
staff, and even attracted passers-
by from Library Walk. 

Dynes complimented the 
crowd of attendees on the strong 
turnout to honor the victims of 
the attacks. 

"Your presence here is proof 
that we are strongest when we 
stand together," he said. "Let us 
focus on the heroes that were 
planted in New York, Virginia 
and Pennsylvania." 

Fleming and Brown presented 
the memorial tree and plaque, and 
Fleming shared his Sept. II expe-
rience of losing an undergraduate 
classmate in the attacks on the 
World Trade Center in New York 
City. 

In her remembrance speech. 
Brown spoke of how the attacks 
made victims of those who were 
involved in the attacks as well as 
those who felt its repercussions. 

"The victims arc the recent 
college graduates who just got 
their first job at the World Trade 
Center and who will never work 

again," she said. "The victims are 
those who are called un-American 
because they question their gov-
ernment. The victims are the 
babies of New York, who will 
never know their father or never 
know their mother. The victims 
arc the students, facul ty, staff and 
community members of UCSD 
and San Diego, who are threat-
ened, harassed, beat up and scared 

" We must acknowledge differences ... and not 
hate each other because 

of our differences. "

because of the color of their skin." 
AI Canata, a UCSD student 

and the business manager for the 
California Rtvitw, said he fel t 
Brown's list of victims could have 
been more inclusive. 

"The victims came up short a 
little bit," he said. "There was no 
mention of our soldiers fighting 
overseas for our freedom."

Brown call ed for the commu-
nity of UCSD to honor the vic-
tims of Sept. II through their 
actions rather than their words, 
and to take away from the events 
of that day the lessons o f the 
importance of communi ty, culture 
and compassion. 

"In honor of all victims at the 
community at UCSD ... we mu t 
work towards a place where toler-
ance, understanding and apprecia-
tion are not just a principle of ollr 
community, but a practice of our 
communi ty," Brown said. "We 
must acknowledge differences, 
celebrate differences, and not hate 
each other beca use of eli ffer -
ences." 

Brown then read the inscrip-

TUES[)AY. SEPTEMBER 24. 2002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

UCSA: Students lobby 
against RPI, fee increase 

continued from page .6 
In add ition, a "no tuition 

increase" campaign will be run in 
the midst of Ca lifornia's budget cri-
sis th.is year. UCSA will be lobbying 
the state legislature to maintain 
funding to protect student tuition 
and fees from being increased, 
which the association has success-
fully done for the past eight years. 

Gov. Gray Davis has announced 
that public institutions will be fac-
ing a 20 percent 'funding cut in the 
next budget due to California's 
deficit. If faced with a 20 percent 
cut to the state budget, UCSA 
believes srudent tuition fees will 
have to be increased. 

"If the UC funding is decreased 
by 20 percent, things are going to 
have to be cut across the board," 
Klass sa id . "If it was just a minor 

decrease, they could make cuts in 
administration , outreach or 
research." 

The regents addressed budget 
issues at a meeting last Thursday, 
which Klass attended. The regents 
gave their report on future budget 
problems and discussed long-term 
planning, which Klass said was a 
good thing. Klass gave a presenta-
tion on UCSA's student interest 
priori ties for the budget. 

Klass said that UCSA and the 
regents have had a g~od working 
relationship in the past and feels 
that they will have one again if he 
does his job well . 

Interested UCSD students can 
participate in working on both 
national and statewide issues with 
UCSA through the A.S. External 
Office, located in the Price Center.

Not being the first of his sib-
lings to leave home for coll ege, his 
mother, Galina, felt good about 
leaving her son at UCSD and 
wished, like most other parents, for 
her son's success. 

"I hope he'll be successful," she 
said, "I hope he'll like it here." 

Although his home is a couple 
of hours north on Interstate 5, she 
still expects him to check in often. 

"1 asked him to call home 
everyday," Galina laughed. "I hope 
so." 

Next to the Babnkos' car was 
:--lancy Dames of Visalia, Calif., 

w~i ting next to her pick-up truck 
ou tside of her daughter's resi-
dence hall. With the truck nearly 
empty and her daughter moving a 
load of boxes into her room, 
Dames spoke nothing but praise 
for the efficiency of the college's 
move-in procedure. 

"The move-in process was won-
derful," she said. "I can't imagine 
she and I tryi ng to move all this 
sni ff." 

C b ire Palmer, the resident dean 
of Vlarren college, helps to coordi-
nate the college's move-in day 
process. 

"Unless you experience it, you 
can't imagine the service we pro-
vide," Palmer said . 

Most colleges rented shopping 
cars or handcarts for students to 
haul their items to their residence 
hall or apa rmlent. Some colleges 

provided students with additional 
assistance by means of studen t vol-
unteers to help expedite the 
process. 

Warren freshmen were met by 
Velvet Touch student volulllcers, 
who used commercial laundry bins 
to help unload cars and move the 
items to students' rooms. T he 
returning Warren students who 

" I have saddles and wraps I 
and ... I had to get a star' 

age space. " 
- Beth Abraham, Revelle College 

freshman 

volunteered with Velvet Touch 
were allowed to move into their 
apartments early on Sept 18. 

Revelle College freshtnen 
could seek help from the members 
of the Revelle College Council 
who worked on the "Cardi~c 
Squad," a name given to the group 
because of the exercise the stu-
dents receive helping to move 
freshmen into the Fleet residence 
halls. All of the Fleet lack an eleva-
tor. 

"By the time they're done, their 
heart is pounding," said Kevin 
Jones, the resident dean of Revell e 
College. 

Most students brought with 
them boxes of computers, laptops, 
stereos, televisions, clothes and 
other items anticipating their need. 

Revelle freshman Beth Abraham 
of Alameda, Calif., went as far as to 
bring her horse to school. 

"I have saddles and wraps, and 
... [ had to get a storage space," she 

said. She hopes to join the equestri-
an tcam. T he horse, meanwhile, is 
staying in Del Mar. 

Beth's mother, Susan, liked her 
daughter's residence hall room. 

"I think it's not that bad," she 
said. "It reminds me of mine [at 
college]." 

Beth's fa th er, Steve, wished 
there was an easier way to bring his 
daughter'S boxes up the tlights of 
stairs to his daughter's suite. 

"It would have been helpful to 
have an elevator in the bui lding," 
he said. 

T he enormity and confusion of 
move-in day and the campus 
seemed to affect most freshmen. 

Leanna Montez, a freshman at 
John Muir College, felt her college 
made the move-in process smooth. 

"Everyone's been helpful," she 
said. "I'm still kind of lost, but 
that's my fault." 

Her mother, Jeanie, who is from 
the Bay Area, liked her daughter's 
ground-floor Tioga Hall room. 

"It needs some work, but she'll 
be safe . The bathrooms are kind of 
in a Slate of disrepair. Hopefully 
they'll take care of those kinds of 
things. But I think she's safe here," 
she said . 

Still setting up her room, the 
younger Monte', experienced a lit-
tle nervousness wi th the prospect 
of starting this quarter. 

"I feel alright," she said of her 
academic abilities. "Any college is 
going to be hard." 

Outside of Tioga, Yong Lee of 
Cypress, Calif., waited in line wi th 
his daughter'S boxes for an elevaUlr. 
He said he felt confident about his 
daughter and her next four years at 
UCSD. 

"[ trust her," he said. "Whatever 
she comes out like after four years 
is fine with me."

Water polo: Tritons prepare for weekend 
continued from paRe A28 

onship form that helped the 
Tri tons win the WWPA tourna-
ment four out of the last five years. 

"We've played some tough 
opponent early in our schedule," 
said senior goalie Lance Onken. 

All the early Ii-iton losses have 
come at the hands of teams from 
the Mount311l Pacific SPOrts 
Federation with the exception of 
Navy, which is "probably the 1 o. 
1 or two team on the ea t coast," 
Onken said. 

UCSD has put some good 
halves together against some of the 
teams from the higher-rated con-
ference. But putting together a fuji 
game of great play has been hard to 
come by this season for the Tritons. 
They know that consistent play will 
be needed if UCSD is to win its 
13th WWPA conference tide. 

"We've been in most of the 
games we've played," said Onken, 
who posted 13 saves against 
Stanford. "But teams have capital-
ized on the counterattack and 
power play." 

If the Triton team has been out 
of sync, it may he because of it 
depth. UCSD suhstitute all six 
players in and out at a time. 
Seniors un the [cam include cap-
tains Bryon Spicer and Paul 
Motschall, as wdl as nken ami 
Kellan Hori , a four-year starter. 

"We arc basica lly 12 players 
deep," Onken said . "Our team 
defense has been fair ly solid, but 
we 've been gett ing some bad 
breaks on shots." 

The Triton men will visi t UC 
Santa Cruz this weekend for the 
UCSC Slugfest, where there wi ll 
be more competition against con-

sports 
writers

Will the women's soccer team win 
another championship? Football at

Ference teams. UCSD will look to 
use this as a pre-conference mea -
suring stick for how they rank 
against tcams in their conference. 

With a two-week layoff before 
the Slugfest, the Tritons have 
been trying to work out some of 
their kinks. 

"We've been training hard 
these past two weeks," Onken said. 
"\ Ve need ro assert some dom i-
nance at the Slugfest to prepare liS 
for the NorCal Tournamcnl." 

The NorCal -lourn'lInent 
includes the tOP 10 teams in the 
nat ion. 

Before the li'itOlls can worry 
about that, however, they must 
contend with \VWPA conference 
foes in Santa Cruz.. T he tourna-
ment starts with three games on 
Saturday and finishes up with two 
more on Sunday.

Tritons enjoys presence of recruits 
Cross country led by young and returning runners 

By ANU KUMAR 
Sports Editor 

After taking 15th place at the 
NCAA Division Il Championships 
last yea r, UCSD came into its 
2002 season with high hopes . 
With a strong core of runners 
returning to the team, head coach 
Ted Van Arsdalc is excited to have 
talented young athle tes join the 
Triton men 's and women 's crass 
country tcams. 

Van Amble said that UCSD 
received a solid recrui ting class that 
has strengthened the Tritons. 

"They are fa r more competitive 
than any ather athletes we have had 
in a long time," Van Arsdale said. 

Each of the two sq uads is made 
up of 20 runners. To keep his ath-
le tes fresh, Van Arsdale then has 10 
runners from each team run in a 
meet one week, whi le the remain-
ing 10 athletes participate in the 
foll owing week's event. 

Leading the men 's crass country 
team are seniors David Dunbar and 
Steve Martin. Dunbar took third 
place in the season-opening event 
at Pa int Loma Nazarene 
University, and he then led the 
Tritons and fini shed 13th with a 

time of 26:3 3 at the Fresno State 
Invitational a n Sept. 14. 

Van Arsdale is pleased wi th the 
leadership that Martin brings to the 
Tritons. 

"He does a terri fic jab of pulling 
all of the runners on th is tea m 
toge ther," Van Arsdale said. 

On the women's side, senior 
Audrey Sung stands out and sets 
the pace for the Tritons. A two-
time Al l-America n in track and 
field, Sung was named Con ference 
Athlete of the Week after she fin -
ished in second place overall with a 
time of 18:09 at the Fresno State 
Invi tational. 

Aside from Sung, freshman 
Kara Gross has shown that she is a 
strong yaung athlete. She led the 
Tritons at the UC Irvine 
Invitational on Sept. 7 and at the 
UC Riverside Invi tationa l a n 
nSept. 21. At Riverside, she took 
ninth place with a time of 19:50, 
which is the 13th best mark ever for 
a T riton female athlete. 

"Kara is an extremely talented 
freshman," Van Arsdale said. 

[n its four meers so fa r this sea-
son, the men's squad won its race at 
Point Loma, finished seventh a ut 
of II teams at the UC Irvine 

Invi tational, took fourth out of 
eight teams at Fresno, and finished 
20th out of 26 teams at Riverside. 

T he wome n 's cross country 
team also won its race at Point 
Lo rna , and the Tritons then took 
eighth place out of 12 teams in 
Irvine. In th e last two weeks, 
UCSD took third Out of 14 teams 
in Fresno and fi nished sixth out of 
14 in Riverside. 

Wi th three meets remaining 
until th e Conference 
Ch ampionships in Bakersfield on 
O ct. 26, Van Arsdale would like to 
see the Tritons work on "team 
dynamics." 

"This is an extremely competi -
tive group, and I want to see them 
working on racing against and 
attacking their opponents togeth-
er," said Arsdale said. 

As wetl as keeping its competi-
tive edge, Van Arsda le wants 
UCSD to work on minimizing its 
pack ti me and keep the time differ-
ence from the fi rst run ner and the 
seventh runner under one minute. 

With the young athletes and 
focused mindset of bath the men's 
and women's cross country teams, 
the Tri tons' hopes cou ld result in a 
memorable season. 

Laying out: The Tritons have played severa l tough games this season. beating Grand Canyon 2{) and fal6ng to Sonoma State 1-0. 

Men's soccer: Tritons off to 4 ... 2 start 
continued from page A:J8 

. University 2-0. 
UCSD lost a heartbreaker to 

Sonoma State an Friday before a 
filled Triton Soccer Stadiulll. 
About 511 fa n watched UCSD 
outshoot its opponent 8-3, bur the 
difference in the ga me came from 
Sonoma State's Brian Cuyne. 
Coyne gOt one passed the Triton 
goalkeeper in the 80th minute of 
the match to push Sonoma State 
over th e Tritons. 

UCSD will go on the road and 
play its next four games away from 
Triton Soccer Stadium. It will play 
at Cal State Las Angeles on Friday, 
before taking on Cal State 
Dominguez Hi lls on Sunday. On 
Oct. 4, UCSD will go to Chico 
State University, and the last of 
these four away games wi ll be at 
riva l campus UC Davis on Oct. 6 . 

T he next two wee ks could 
prove to be critical in the T rito ns' 
bid fo r a postseason posi tion. In 
200 1, the Tri tons played well with 
their backs agai nst the wall and 
fought off elimin ation for several 
games. Ma intaining the solid all -
around performance the tea m has 
been displaying early on in 2002, 
and b:ming no injuries, UCSD 
should be able to contend against 
other CCAA opponents and make 
a strang push for the playoffs. 

Lran Uew/Gucmtan 
Lookinl .head: The Tritons will play its next four games on the road against Cal 
State Los Angeles, Cal State Dominguez Hills, Chico State and UC Davis.

Baseball: 
Players and 

owners register 
a save 

continued from page A26 
by winning division championships 
in recent years, it doesn 't take a large 
market to make a successful team. 

The values of baseball itsel f are 
also representa tive of what America 
should be. Players go through a farm 
system of minor league teams, where 
they play the game without making 
the big buc1cs. It's a sport that relies 
on individual achievement as well as 
a team effort. One team cannot 
dominate every game; even the team 
with the worst record can beat the 
team with the best record on any 
given night, depending on pitching 
and changes of fomme. 

A strike-shortened season, such 
as the 1994 season, would have 
gone against everything that base-
ball stands for. ' 

The new collective bargaining 
agreement shows that players and 
owners care enough to make sure 
the season goes on, and it could 
not have happened at a better 
time. Preside nt George W. Bush, 
who used to awn the Texas 
Rangers, stated tha t a labor settle-
ment in baseball was important for 
the morale of the entire country. 

Non-sports fans may think it 's 
strange to devote so much atten-
tion to a mere game, but competi-
tive sports everywhere have tran-
scended the role of entertainment 
and recreation and have come to 
represent pride, camaraderie and 
tradition. 

Fans go so far as to refer to the 
actions of their favorite team as their 
own: "We beat the Dodgers roday!" 
And this year, the fans showed that 
they are just as involved and devoted 
as the players and owners. 

Baseball is about more than 
just watching guys hit a ball with a 
bat. [t's . about competitive spirit 
and perseverance. It's about work-
ing together and get ti ng the job 
done. It's about having a goad 
time and giving everyone a 
chance. 

Baseball has long prided irself as 
our national pastime, and for now, 
it lives up to irs title.

COMMENTARY 

Major League Baseball survives dispute 
To the relief of fans across the nation, the players and owners pr~vented a lethal strike 

By ANDREW FU 
Contributing Writer 

The contradiction of America is 
that it is supposed to support the 
mdividual, but It is also supposed to 
be united. \,ve are ca lled the "land 
of the free," but also the "United 
States," and often we face the chal-
lenge of reconciling opposing opin-
ions in a diverse coun try. But the 
bC;llItv of America is that we've 
thm'cd on this conHict of ideals and 
,trll lIIanaged to function as a 
1l,1tI01l.

For the lin.t wnc in morc than 
30 ) c,lrs. players and t( m owners 
developed :l collective bargaining 
,lgreemellt without a work stop-
p.lgc. Both side, worked to benefit 
the whole. and thus to benefit 
themsell'cs. 

.\s the players' se lf-imposed 
Aug. 30 trike (btc loomed, the 

playn~' union and the owners 
held all-night meetings and 

worked om a collectiv~ bargaining 
agreement with which both sides 
were satislled to avoid endi ng the 
season and aliena ting milli ons of 
f'\I1s . 

Baseball embodies America and 
did not crumble in the face of 
adversity. Instead of imploding into 
chaos and disagreement, players 
and owners were able to come 
together and realize their common 
goal. 

Indeed, the labor dispute at 
times did seem to ullderlie the 
more negative aspects of America 
- grecdy rich pi:Jyers arguing with 

~rcedy rich owners. bitter fans boo-
ing pt',,),crs ancl thruwiJlg foul balls 
back ontO the field, but the fans ' 
protest lVa~ definitely onc of the 
main factors in the pl,l)'ers' and 
owners' strong desire to come to a 
compromise. Basehall's fan an ti 
traditions were among the main 
rea 'ons there was no strike. 

r n the true American spiri t of 
contradiction, A.merica holds onto 
tr,,,li tion even when it seems 
impractical and outdated -

The new agreement .shows 

" Baseball embodies 
America and did not 
crumble in the face of 
adversity. Instead of 

imploding into chaos and 
disagreement, playlers and 
oumers were able to come 
together and realize their 

al II commongo . 
that, like America, baseball ca res 
ahom history and traditi o n 
enough to sacrifice potential busi-
ncss profit . 

For example, the agreement 
stipulates that no baseball team 
will be considered for contraction 
until 2006, which saves the 
Minnesota Twins and the 
Montrea l Expos, who were both in 
danger of being cur from the 
major league. 

Also in the agreement is a rev-
enue-shari ng policy, in which 
roughly one-third of each team's 
revenue will be pooled and redis-
tributed among all 30 tcams, T his 
will help to cut the gap slightly 
between teams in large markets, 
such as New York, and teams in 
small markets, such as Minnesota 
and Montreal. 

Some owners have long been 
trying to move their teams from 
small markets to places where they 
will make more profits, However, 
the MLB has strict rules on moving 
teams in order to maintain the his-
tory and fan base of teams where 
t11ey are. 

Thus, in a sports world where 
football , basketball and hockey 
teams are constantly moving to find 
greener pastures, baseball has 

remained remarkablv stablc. The 
last baseba ll team m'oved in 197 1, 
when the Washington SenJrors 
became the Texas Rangers, Si nce 
then, football's Raiders have moved 
from Oakland to Los Angeles, then 
back to OakJand. 

Consider this: San Diego can be 
considered a "small market" city. 
The Padres' revenue is in the bot-
tom third of all major league teams, 
and their annual pl ayer payroll. at 
around $40 million, is fifth lowest 
in the majors. Vcr the P'Hlres have 
heen in San Diego sin('c I96H and 
aren't going 'll1ywhcre. In fact . th(:)' 
are schedirlcd to open :I m:w h:"e-
ball-only stadiullI for the 200+ ,(:;1-

\Nith the new revenue-sharing 
clause of the collective bargaining 
agreement, the team will be able to 
increase its payroll and compete 
better with, say, the Los Angeles 
Dodgers, which have a payroll of 
well over $1 00 million , 

As teams such as the Oakland A's 
and Minnesota Twins have proven

Men's Soccer 
UCSD reaches 

critical point in its 
chedule after a 

solid start in 2002 
By ANU KUMAR 

Sports Editor 

DUring its 200 1 ca mpaign , 
UCSD men's soccer made a 
push late in the season for the 
playoffs, but its postseason 
hopes probably faded early that 
year. The Tritons dug them -
selves a deep hole that they 
could not climb out of last sea-
son when they started by drop-
pi ng eIght of their first 10 
games. However, UCSD has yet 
to fall into any holes with a 4-2 
record so far this season . 

The Tri tons are led by senior 
Bobby Saadati , who has three 
goals an d two assists in this 
young season. UCSD has also 
enjoyed strong play fl om sopho-
more Tiago Venturi , who pro-
vided two goals and twO assists 
in the firs t six games of the sea-
son.

Water Polo 
UCSD is not satisfied with 4 .. 6 start, 
but the Tritons are not worried yet 

By OWEN MAIN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's water polo 
team hasn't started its sea on quite 
the way it would have liked. But 
then again, the team has made it 
clear that hitti ng the panic button 
may still be a bit premature. 

A 4-6 record at the end of last 
week may seem unusual for the 
Tritons, which are a perennial 
powcr in the Westem Water Polo 
Associa tion , but early losses to 
nonconference powers USC, 

Stanford Universiry (twice), 
UCS B, Long Beach State and 
Navy may all become a moot point 
when it comes to making the p:ay-
offs. Still ranked 11 th in the nation 
with SIX losse , the Tritons have 
shown that their record may not 
be indicative of the team they are. 

By beating WWPA conference 
rival Loyola Marymount in the 
Triton Invitational earl ier this yea r, 
UCSD showed that it might not be 
very fa r away from the champi-

UCSD continues

By BRYCE WARWICK 
Staff Writer 

Coming off a season in which 
the UCSD women's volleyball 
team surpassed expectations and 
went all the way to the national 
se mifinal match, the Tritons 
return this season looking to live 
up to their newfound sta tus as a 
serious title contender. 

UCSD opened its season 9-2 
overall and 3-1 in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association. 
The Tritons ' first setback came at 
the hands of l Oth-ranked Western 
Washington Universiry in a five-
set affair on Aug. 30. Their second 
loss was more shoclcing, since 
unranked Cal State Stanislaus 
swept UCSD in a tight match (36-
34, 30-28, 30-28). 

Aside from those setbacks, the 
Tritons have been a dominant 
squad , talcing only three games to 
dispose of their opponents in six 
of their nine victories. Even in

Bryce Warwick 
Our belovecl UCSD is chang-

ing. 
This cam pus, once a sanctuary 

for apathy, indifference and lifeless-
ness, now shows signs of change. 
Having been in an Diego for 10 
days now, I question if this is the 
same campus I left . 

First of all, while helping fresh-
men move into their dorms in 
Revelle Colle ge 0 11 Saturday, 1 
noticed attractive fres hmen females 
and ocially competent male Stu-
dents in significant numbe rs. 
Stunned and confused, I moved on 
to a Sixth College informational 
fai r, where I was rei ieved to see the 
thick-rim med glasses to which I've 
become accustomed . BlIt th e crowd 
of 5nldents aro und the Triton Tide 
table, excited about goi ng to athlet-
ic events and wantIng tu gt:t 
involved, threw me off even more. 
Could it be that these UCSD stu-
dents might actuall y put down their 
biochemistry ho mework every 
once in a whil e to attend a basket-
ball ga me? 

Everywhere I look, I see signs 
that this ca mpus is changing. The 
aw nings in the Price Center are 
slowly becoming blue 'InJ gold, 
"Home Team" po't!!rs are all over 
campus, and perhaps most impor-
tantly, thi s year's .\ .5. budget 
includes a igllllicant amount of 
money allocated to increas11lg 
school spiri t. 

Even so, Friday afternoon may 
well have been th e greatest sign of 
change. After dealing with all kinds 
of unforesee n iss lles at the oft1cc, I 
grabbed a quick dinner and headed 
over to the men's soccer game 10 
minutes late. I parked my car, got 
my program - and then nlY jaw 
dropped. At 4:30 p.m. on a Fri(i:1y 
afternoon at UCSD. before most 
students returned to school , I saw 
500 soccer fans. 

Being tlccustomed to a sc hoo l .It 
which I had my pick of any seat 11l 

. the house , I was a bit angry, and yet 
excited. Instead of being able to sit 
right in the center section. I co uld 
find nothing but a little space o n 
the far left side, halfway up the 
bleachers , jammed between two 
teams of screaming IO-yea r-olds in 
soccer jerseys. My favorite seat 
wasn't there, but the guy sitting in 
it was yelling for UCSD just like I 
would have been, and he brought 
his friends. The frat guys carne, 
too, and carried their couches 
down to the edge of the field , 
watching and cheering. It felt like a _ 
real home field advantage, and it 
was fun to be there. 

Maybe it's too early to tell. 
Maybe midterms and papers will 
temper the enthusiasm, and pretty 
soon UCS D will settle back to its 
sleepy existence. Maybe students 
won'! recognize that t hings are 
changing around here and will 
spend their Friday nights doing the 
same old homework. . 

Maybe. But until they do, I'm 
goi ng to enjoy a school that knows 
how to have a little fun, and I'm 
showing up earlier to games. If 
UCSD is going to change. I want to 
be in the front row when it happens.

Long-awaited new college opens at UCSD 
Sixth College is open for business and welcoming their freshman class 

By VALERIE NG 
Staff write r 

As a new academic tarts at VCS D, a new college wi ll be makmg its mark on campus. 
SiXth College, the la test addition to 
UCSD's multiple-college system , is 
opcllIng after three years of planning. 
The opelll ng has come with chal-
lenge;, .lI1J life around the adminis-
IIJtion bui lding has been hectic. 

"E\'cry aspect is a challenge," 
s.lId G ,l bnde \\ 'ienhausen, provost 
of Sixth College. "The challenge 
stJrts with findmg space for the 
college, \\'e also have to build it 
from ~c ra tch . We have nothing to 
bui ld upon, which is a challenge 
but also exciti ng. We must also hire 
staff, come up with a curriculum, 
and attract fac ul ty. " 

Noticing the stressful project, 
,tudems frolll other colleges have 
('ome bv and asked how thev can 
help, wi-II ch, as \'\'ien hausen ~otes, 
rdlms the pi rit of UCSD. 

"The emire cam p us is raking 
rc>ponsibility for ou r college and 
w3nts us to succeed ," ' Nienhausen 
,aid, 

Arrracti ng fac ul ty was not as diffi -
l'ult as it could have been, according 
ro Wicnhauscn. 

"Some were reall y attracted to 
the theme and the fact that it was a 
new coll ege," Wt enhausen said. 
"'YI'e ha d strong support in terms of 
the many creative people who 
donated time and energy." 

As the steering committee devel-
oped the college, it knew the impor-
tance of learning a bout culrures. 
Often, the first two things devel-
oped by a culture are unique art and 
technology, which are intertwined . 

According to Wienhausen, the 
theme wo uld "help students be 
imroduced to the richness of the 
academic programs the school has 
to offer, which is what makes 
VCS D stro ng." 

What sets Sixth College apart 
from other colleges is an interdisci -
pli nary approach to learning. The 

280 JIlcoming freshmen will take a 
three-quartcr core sequence ca lled 
"C ulture, Art and Technology," 
which integrates learning in the ;Irts 
and humani ties, social sciences, sci-
ence and engineering. Studel~ts will 
also acquire computer and informa-
tion literacy, as well as writing and 
communication skills. The courses 
wi ll be co-taught by faculty from 
several deparonents includi ng engi-
neering, communication, history, 
thea ter, visual ar ts, literature, phi-
losophy and sociology. Thcy will 
include labs in which students \vi ll 
work in small groups to solve prob-

understand the people in 
other environments by

and dreams of local com' 

munities."

lems po ed in their readings, lec-
tures and discussions while gaining 
communication skills and iearning 
to collaborate across disciplines. 

"All [core] courses \vill be linked 
together by specific central ques-
tions," said Hillel Schwartz, director 
of the core sequence. 

TIlls year, studen ts will be a ble to 
choose whether they want a large 
lecrure course, a small lecture course 
or a fieldwork course that is mainly 
made up of seminar and exploration. 

However, don't expect the 
sequence to sray the same. for long. 

"We are ready to have students 
help us 'redesign the ne~v curricu-
lum," Schwartz said. 

Each student will al so be 
required to purchase a "writing 
box," which contains writing mate-

rials, tape, a kazoo and clay, which 
they will use to express themselves 
in some way. 

" \ Ve want students to learn and 
express themselves other than in 
the written and spoke n word," 
Wienhausen said. 

The writing box will also include 
an anthology containing different 
types of writing , which the students 
will use a models for exploring new 
wri ting styles and reaching different 
audiences. 

Sixth College breadth require-
ments renect the complexity of the 
college. Studen ts must take courses 
in social analysis , narrative, aesthet-
ic and historical reasoning, analytic 
methodologies/scientitic method, 
stmctured reasoning, data explo-
ration, societal contexts, social con-
text, ethical context and art making. 

Another unique aspect of Sixth 
C o llege is the way in which tech-
nology, one o f its themes, will be 
used as a tool. The college 's chief 
technology officer will help identi-
fy the techno logy that is appropri-
ate by polling students in the class-
room to ge t feedback, This will also 
help the faculty teach . 

The college also has a computer 
playground, which, as Schwartz 
describes , is "a digital playground 
for students with interesting com-
puters and software to create video, 
animation and scenarios so they can 
becoJlle reflective about what it 
means to live in a digital world." 

Equally important at Sixth 
College will be making lasting con-
nections between the classroom 
and the community. 

"Our students need to under-
stand the people in other environ-
ments by learning about the needs 
and dreams of local communities," 
vVienhausen said. 

Students will have the chance to 
reach out to their surrounding com-
munities during their senior year, 
when they must complete a 
practicum. The aim of the practicum 
is for students to apply the ideas and 
methods learned in their core

of culture, art and technology. It can

UCSD or an internship or corrunu-

versity. An outside activity would 
give students the chance to become a 
part of a larger community, thus 
keeping with another emphasis of 

the college: learning to work, listen 
and collaborate with one another. 

As part of the practicutll, students 
must also take a two-unit course in 
which they will present the purpose 
and outcome of thei r respective pro-
jects. They are free to express thei r

An ody~sey through Iran: one student's summer vacation 
An Eleanor Roosevelt student visits her ancestral home in the Middle East during a time of conflict 

By PARISA BAHARIAN 
Associate Features Editor 

Eleanor Rooseve lt College seni or Shamideh Rossoukh-Cruz donned th e rupush and 
rusari, th e required Islamic coat-
li ke covering and headscarf, this 
SUlllmer before departing to the 
city of Tehran in early Jul y. Like 
many stude nts, Rossoukh-Cruz has 
roots in the historic ci ty. This sum-
mer, she passed up traveling to 
London in favor of visiting her 
father's ancestral home of Iran. 

It was 3 a.m. when she got her 
first look at Iran. Rossoukh-Cmz 
was immediately enveloped in 
throngs of people waiting for lug-
gage at the baggage claim. She said 
she felt as if she had stepped into a 
sauna, as the weather was hot and 
muggy. 

Rossoukh-Cruz was both excited 
and nervous as she waited to meet 
her brother. 

"I was excited to be in Iran," 
Rossoukh-Cruz said. "But I was a bit 
nervous at the same time because all 
my bunons fell off of my rupush and 
so I had to hold my pillow against 
my body to cover myself. I didn't 
know what ",ould happen to me if I 
wasn't covered properly." 

Prior to traveling to Iran, she 
had questioned her brother, 
Raymar Rossoukh - a Ph.D. can-
didate of anthropology and Middle 
Eastern studies at Harvard 
University, about what wa legal 
and illegal in Iran so she could pac k 

and prepare herself accordingly. 
"I kept pestering my brother 

with questions like 'could I wear 
nail polish and open toed shoes' 
and he said yes to both," Rossoukh-
Cruz related. "I learned that since 
about four years ago when the 
more moderate president was elect-
ed, the morality laws became less 
strictly enforced, allowing women 
more freedom in personal dress and 
appearance ... 

Even though some laws have 
become more relaxed, Rossoukh-
Cruz found that other laws, espe-
cially those involving un-Isl:unic 
social behavior, have remained 
rigidly enforced. 

For example, unrelated women 
and men cannot appear or walk 
together in public. Dancing is only 
allowed separated along gender 
lines in the privacy of homes. 
Alcohol and western music are 
banned. Dating i.s forbidden . 

Rossoukh-Cruz said that these 
crimes of un-Islamic behavior are 
enforced by the "morality police" 
and punishable by fines, jail terms 
or flogging. 

Rossoukh-Cruz found that liv-
ing under these restrictive laws in 
Tehran was difficult. 

"It was like I had most of my 
human rights and freedoms 
stripped away," Rossoukh-Cruz 
stated . "I was forced to cover 
myself. As a consequence, I felt 
constrained." 

he said that she was forced to 
act a certain way in public.

A face in the crowd: At a bauar in the city of Shiraz, Iran, Rossoukh-Cruz poses next to a, Mullan, a religious hardliner. 

"I couldn't laugh or walle &eeiy 
with my brother without having the 
fear that we'd . be stopped," 
Rossoukh-Cruz said. "I couldn't 
turn on the TV and watch what I 
wanted or turn on the radio and 
nllle i mo whatever music I felt like. 
The luxuries I had taken for grant-

ed back home were absent." 
These restrictive laws, Rossoukh-

Cruz observed, foster a competing 
rift between the public persona and 
private persona of each Iranian. 

"There is a clear, unbridgeable 
split between the public and private 
worlds of an average Iranian," 

Rossoukh-Cruz said. "In public, 
you must act a ce"ain way, you are 
restrained from enjoying yourself 
with your friends. In private, how-
ever, you can laugh, dance, hang 
Out with boys and girls, watch

MTV and drink as you please." 
The eyes, Rossoukh-Cruz 

noticed, are the primary means by 
which Iranian women communi-
cated. 

"By being restrained from 
physically and verbally expressing 
themselves in public, Iranian 
women learned to say their feel-
ings and emotions with their 
eyes," Rossoukh-Cruz said. 
"Thei r hearts speak through their 
eyes." 

Despi te the many restrictions 
in Iran, Rossoukh-Cruz witnessed 
the ways in which the youth and 
college-aged girls and boys 
responded to and stretched the 
restric tive laws to allow some 
measure of dating. 

"The boys and girls would 
cruise in their car down specific 
pre-arranged streets, which 
allowed them thc precious time to 
ee each other from afa r," 

Ro soukh -Cruz sa id . "Anoth er 
popular way to get around the law 
01 non-famil y members of OPPO-
ite sexes together in public was to 

dress up nice and take a walk in 
the park where they could 'acci-
dentally' meet." 

Despi te the current situation in 
Iran for women and youth , 
Ro sOllkh -Cnlz beli eves it is 
un fa ir to designatc Iran as a "back-
wards," repressive Middle 
Eastern regi me. 

"Iran outranks rh e o ther Arab 
countr ies in the personal free-
doms granted, espec iall y to 
women, " Rossoukh-Cruz said . 
"For in tance, unlike in Saudi 
Arabia, where women are not 
allowed to vote or to dr ive , 
women in Iran have those rights 
and more." 

Iranian women are legally able 
to own property and to hold pub-
lic offices. Rossoukh-Cruz also 
points to the dramatic increasing 
levels of women attending univer-
sity to over 60 percent as an indi-
cator of Iran's moving forward, 
however slow in Western eyes, 
towards comprehensive reform. 

After spending two full weeks 
in Tehran, she and her brother set 
off for Esfahan. Iran, where they 
visited the Shah's palace, mosques 
and bazaars. 

While visiting the Shah's 
palace, Rossoukh-Cruz discovered 
a startling fact when she sat down 
to rest on a cement block. 

"My brother showed me that 
the Farsi writing on the block I 
was sitting translated to "Death to 
America," Rossoukh-Cruz said . 
"The phrase didn'r shock me that 
much, as it is somewhat common 
to find such phrases in certain 
areas. " 

Blit Rossoukh-Cruz said that 
contrary to widespread belief that 
Iranians hate Americans, she dis-
covered that the government and 
religio us officia ls mainly put up 
suc h violent phrases aga inst 
Ameri ca. 

"The people of Iran don't have 
a problem with America, its the 
government that does," she sai d. 
" Iranians love America and the 
full encompassing personal free-
doms allowed." 

From Esfahan , the siste r and 
brother then traveled to th e base 
of the Z agros Mountains in the 
western part of Iran to jo in up 
with the Bakhtiyari tribe. 

The Bakhti yari are a pastoral 
nomadic tribe of Persian ori gi ns 
that herd sheep and goats . 

To reach the Bakhtiyari tribe,

she said that had to cl imb the 
mountain in 100-plus degree 
weather in her tennis shoes and 
black rupush and rusar i covering 
her jeans and shin , 

Rossoukh-Cruz, a self-
described hiking novice, sa icl the 
climbing was extremely difficult. 

"The mountain was reall y 
steep, ar least a 70-degree angle," 
she said. "'vVe had to cl imb over 
rocks and thorns." 

By time Rossoukh-Cru z 
reached the top of the mountain 
six hours later, she said her jeans 
were covered in red dots and her 
legs covered in bloody scratches. 
H er legs wouldn't srop quaking 
from exhaustion. But Rossoukh-
Cruz said that climbing the moun-
tain was her gre:ttest personal 
achievement.

Lindsay Boyd 

Where have 
all the fun 
times gone? 

This year I was really looking forward to school. I thought third rime's a charm. Freshman 
year 1 didn't know what to expect. 
Sophomore year I knew what to 
expect and I didn't want to come 
back to school, but this year I was 
really psyched. I spent all summer 
revising my schedule to take all the 
classes I thought were interesting, 
which is every class in the catalog, 
and I was already planning the sec-
tions of features . I 
was dreaming about 
all the provocative 
articles I wanted to 
wri te, and all the 
people I wanted to 
interview. Then last 
night I went to see 
"The Banga 
Sisters" and sud -
denly rea lized I'm 
not cool. I used to be cool. I u ed to 
hang out with bands and play guitar 
and sneak backstage at concerts. I 
hung out in 10IJby of radio stations 
3Ild chased a fter tour buses. I was 
lim! My fri ends had mowhawks and 
tanoos, and I spent Saturday nightS 
at the Rocky Horror Picture show. 

It's been a long road to becom-
ing uncool. [ guess it started with 
AP classes, SATs and San Diego 
clubs that are 21 and up. The last 
concert I went to was Bruce 
Springsteen . H ello, I was three 
when The Boss was popular. I was 
the youngest person at that con-
cert. I listen to NPR and watch 
CNN. When did I turn into my 
fa ther' 1 used to beg my dad to rum 
off "All things considered" an now 

I'm even worse then he - I lis ten 
to "Moneyline!" 

Now the wei rd thing is I actu -
ally like classes. No one is twis ting 
my arm to be an academi c. I 
couldn't decide between a litera-
ture major and a critical gender 
studies major, so I decided on 
both. That was after I realized that 
three separate min ors was exces-
sive. But I also like rock 'n ' roll , 
eacing at Denny's at five in the 

mornin g and thc

San Diego CEO creates a new way for students to pay for college 
One of UCSD's most successful alumnus has started a new loan service that allows students to graduate debt-free 

By LINDSAY BOYD 
Features Editor 

The struggle to pay for college may soon become a little easier for smdents at UCSD. The 
Robertson Ed ucation 
Empowerment Foundation is 
lalmching a new loan program this 
quarter that offers students more 
financial freedom in pa)~ng college 
tuition. The way it works is students 
can receive up to $7,000 of interest-
free money a year. After the snldent 
graduates, he or she agrees to pay a 
fixed percentage of their salary for a 
tixed period of time. R.E.E.F claims 
that this allows students to graduate 
debt-free. 

"Instead of havi ng interest or 
principal, you promise to pay back a 
percentage of your income for x-
amount of years once you graduate," 
said Tina Stahlke, executive director 
of R.E.E.E "When you make less, 
you pay back less, when you make 
more you pay back more." 

Unlike many loans that require 
repayment immediately, or six 
months after graduation, R.E.E.F.s 
program waits Wltil the student finds 
full-time employment. What 
R.E.E.F. hopes is that students will 
not have to find employment simply 
to pay back thei r smdent loans, but 
rather have the freedom to firtd the 
job they want. 

Applying for R.E.E.F. is also 3 lot 
simpler then filing a FAFSA. "Right 
now the only eligibility requi rement 

is that you be a California resident 
and have a 3.0 GPA," Stahlke sa id. 
"It's all based on merit and is essen-
tially based on the individuals aspira-
tions and goals. We're investing in 
an individual , and investing that 
they're going to succeed." 

T he application process is com-
pletely done online through their 
Web si te. 

Standardized rest scores and 
GPAs are all taken into account to 
determine the percentage in which 
you will pay your loan back. 

"This is one where you actually 
investing in an individual," Stahlke 
said. "You can't really invest in the 
university the way you can invest in 
human capitol." 

This new program is exclusive to 
UCSD because it's founder is one of 
UCSD's most successful alumnus. 
Michael Robertson ,founder of 
MP3 .com and now Lindows.com, is 
a 1990 Earl. Warren College gradu-
ate, and was one of the first to grad-
uate in Cognitive Science. 
Robertson honed his computer skills 
by interning at the San Diego 
Supercomputer Center. In fact, the 
geneses for MP3 .com happened 
during his undergraduate years at 
the Supercomputer Center. 

As an innovator in new technolo-
gies Robertson is always looking to 
buck the system and shake things up, 
and R.E.E.E is similar in that it is a 
brand new, innovative approach to 
academic ftmding. _ 

"Our goal is rea lly to add a lot

invest in anything in the world now, 
you prerry much can except for 
schools. Ironicall y, everyone believes 
schools are good, bur theres no ways 
to use that as an investment vehi-
cle." 

In a year that has seen the srock 
market plummet, Robertson wants 
to introduce a safer investment -
human beings. 

"The concept is making a vehicle 
so people so people can invest in 
schools, because if you do that, you'll 
see a lot more money going towards 
schools," Robertson said. "That's 
what R.E.E.F. is all about is making a 
vehicle so people can invest in 
school, because it's a good invest-
ment. Not just so they'll feel better 
because their name is on a building, 
but 50 they'll actually get a return on 
their money." 

With many people experiencing 
a financial aid crunch th is year, 
Robertson's idea may have come 
along just in the nick of time. 

"I think academic funding is 
going to go through a tough period 
for the next couple years because of 
the state budget deficit," Robertson 
said. "There needs to be new fund -
ing sources that compensate, and 
that's our hope with R.E.E.F." 

Robertson adds that R. E.E. F is 
not only a good oppommity for 
investors, but for students as well. "1 
think there are some real benefits to 
students too. There are some advan-
tages that educational invesmlents 
do have. They avoid this problem of 

getting out of school and having thiS 
huge debr ar a tillle when yuu lIlaybe 
arc not making that much muncy," 
Robertson said. "There's people who 
have to take certain jobs, nOt hecause 
they want them, but because th e~' 
have ro make a lot of 11'Ioney JUSt to 
service their loans. As an c;ltreprc-
neur, I'm glad I could strike out un 
my own where there werc sumc vcry 
thin early years where if I had to ser-
vice a big debt , I definltcly would 
have bcen in default." 

Of course, financial \\'oes no 
longer trouble Robertson, who was 
included in fomme Magazine's 40 
Richest under 40. After the success 
of MP3 .com, Robertson is now 
heading Lindows.com, whi ch IS 
challenging Microsoft's desktop 
applications. 

"We build an operating sy tem 
that is based on LifllLl, thaI l:OSr5 a 
fraction of what Microsoft's does" he 
said. 

Robertson has seemed to wea ther 
the dot-com crash prctty well, and 
with R.E.E.F. he's hoping other 
UCSD students will survive the 
troubled economy and be able to 
pursue thei r goals. He also has a 
challenge for UCSD students. 

"I'm paying $25 to every snldent 
that beats me on the Chancellor's 
fun run," Rohertson said. "So hello 
UCSD track team, get out there, 
because I'm training."

New College: Students give 
their views on Sixth College 

conrinued from page 82 
site, lecture or performance. 

Incoming srudents are excited 
about being :1 part of a new college. 

"I chose Sixth College because 
it's the newest and I will have a 
chance to come up with the name 
and be a part of the fi rs t class to go 
through the college," said freshman 
Kyle Happe. 

The uniqueness of the coll ege 
has played a role in anraning some 
students. 

"[Sixth] was the only one that was 
different from the other [coll eges!." 
said Loren Baxter, a Sixth College 
student. He also notes dl,)t the stmJlI 
size will have its benefi ts. "It's going 
to be close around here with so few 
snldents," he said. 

Horoscope: Aquarius should 
launch new projects on Friday 

conrinued (rom page 86 
Aquarius Gan. 20-Feb. 18) Today is 
a 6. Mer an initial setback, your 
intentions should succeed. Friday 
and Saturday should be just great for 
travel or visiting friends. Those are 
also good days for launching new 
projects. 

Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20) Today 
is a 6. Continue to investigate 
your suspicions about domesti c 
matters. Did a fam ily member 
follow through on a promise' It's 
OK to offer a reminder. Your sug-

Yes , faithl1tl hiatus readers, the Academic 
Calendar foretells a year more stimulating 
than Bastille Day. Yes, a year possibly more 
electrifying than UCSD's 40th anniversary 
celebration. Yes, non -believers, more fun 
than Free Bagel Day during Commuter

UCSD administration) have arranged an

Sept. 23: First day of the 
quarter/the Hearing Aids Birthday 

Our frightfu ll y aware administration has 
deftly accounted for all srudents seated in 
the back row of Center 101 Lecmre Hall. It 
is a day of celebration for the hearing aid, 
first available on Sept. 23, 1899. The con-
traption was made of carb<;ln, commercially 
manufactured and cost $400, 

In constant 2002 dollars, dut same hear: 
ing aid would COSt $8,17 1.66 - roughly the 
price of the average engineering textbook. 
Conversely, if a hearing aid cost $400 today, 
It would be wonh $19.58 in 1899 - rough -
ly the buy-back price of that same book.

Festival. 

The festival is in memoriam of fried

London, Ky. was home to the first KFC, so

Od. 11: Add Classes Deadline/The 
. "Almost There" Columbus Day 

Legend has it that at 10 p.lll. on Oct. I I, 
1492 , Christopher Columbus saw a dim 
light on the horizon whil e aboard the Santa 
Maria. He anticipated it to be land and 
jumped about the ship In fits of exci tement. 
In between patting himself on the back and 
shaking his own hand, he pointed our the 
"land" to Pero G uiterrez and Rodri go 
Sanchez. Guiterrez saw the li ght, but 
Sanchez reportedly called Guiterrez a 

brown-noser and denied seeing any land. 
Four hours later, me ship drifted ashore the 
New World and Sanchez hung his he:sd in 
shame. 

So, to celebrate that, add a class to your 
schedule. Columbus would have wanted it, 
on account of his being such an overachiever.

UCSD organizations aim 
to bring many diversions 
Despite popular belief, there are things to 

do on campus, whether it's concerts or films 
By MARA EVANS 

Associate Hiatus Editor 

M· ost UCS D newcomers have been warned that despite the revelries of Welcome Week, 
UCSD is not a parry school. BUI 
while it is true that beer does not 
Aow freely down Library Walk, 
nor do people go skinny dipping at 
the Canyon View pool, UCSD's 
entertainment possibilities abound 
if you know where to look. Here is 
some insight into where to look 
for a good time and how to get 
involved in campus entertainment. 

Associated Students Prol ramminl 
Office 

Located on the third Aoor of 
the Price Center, the A.S. 
Programming Office is run by 
Gabe Grossman, commissioner of 
programming. The office from 
which Grossman works is small, 
cramped and packed with music 
memorabilia. It is from this tiny 
space that huge events, such as the 
upcoming Fall Fest, are put 
together. The quanerly music fes-
tivals are hot attractions for the 
UCSD campus, especially the 

spring Sun God Festival. In the 
past, bands such as I 0 Doubt, 3 II 
and The Roots have performed 
free of charge for hordes of stu-
dents. 

Good music doesn 't only 
come to UCSD every thre~ 
months, though. The program-
ming office coordinates the peri -
odic "nooner" shows \ ith local 
acts at Price Center, as well as the 
freq uent vendor fairs o n library 
walk. 

The A.S. Programming Office 
also works with other campus Stu-
dent groups to produ ce fund-
raising events. Those interested in 
contributing to or attending 
upcoming events, or organizing 
their own, can find out more about 
A.S. prbgr'amming at 
http://www.amrsd.edll or can call 
the A.S. Programming office at 
(858)534-52 59.

By ANNE CONG-HUYEN 

Associate Hiatus Editor 

Do you find that it's another boring UCSD Friday night and you have nothjng to do? 
Don 't despair, friends, because 
entertainment will be provided this 
Friday by UCSD's own Deejays 
and Vinylphiles Club, with their 
beginning-of-the-quarter dance 
parry "Equations" at .Poner's Pub. 

Farnous on campus for their 
super late-night shindigs where the 
music never stops, their latest 
endeavor will undoubtedly not cease 
to entertain and awe. With two areas 
of music, where 12 DJs will play over 
the course of the night, almost every 
imaginable genre of dance music will 
be covered, from tranc~ and house to 
bre;lks and slammin' funky disco 
house. So those with discriminating 
tastes in music need not fear; they 
shall be appeased. 

For others who thin~ DJs are 
simply a bunch of weird guys with 
equally weird pseudonyms who 1ike 
to play with big, archaic records, 
think again. Many experienced and 
knowledgeable men and women 

who have a passion for music 
devote much of their time to learn-
ing this ski ll and the expertise 
needed to acquire it. 

For any of you aspiring DJs, 
DVC is not just a group that 
throws great parties. They also 
hold free training seminars where 
any UCSD student can come ,md 
hang out with other people who 
love the same thing. 

. According to DVC Publicist 
Lisa Jaycox, the club is committed 
to "promoting electronic music in 
vinyl form." 

And their legendary parties are 
where UCSD DJs can showcase 
their talents in an inviting arnlOS-
phere. So come out this Friday and 
support your local OJ. 

'The party starts at 7 p. m. and 
goes on until 1 a.m. It is free to 
UCSD students with a valid ID, 
and one guest is allowed per (D. 
Come early before the event reach-
es maximum capacity, which they 
most likely will. And for those who 
are interested, DVC meets Monday 
nights at 7 p.m. in the Media 
Lounge on the second floor of the 
Old Student Center.

ftice, whi ch is also located on the 
third floor of the Price Cel;ter, 
bri ngs many or these events to the 
UCSD campus. While the A.S. 
Programming Office attracts many 
local and mainstream acts to 
UCSD, UEO aims for more 
diverse perrormanccs. As a result, 
students are able to enjoy music 
from all over the world. In October 
alone, three continents will be rep-
resented on the Mandeville 
Auditorium stage. 

In addition to music produc-
tions, UEO hosrs the annual San 
Diego Internationa l Film Festival, 
which takes place later in the 
sc hool year. T he month-long 
event brings a wide breadth of 
international talent to Price

During Open House, UCSD 
has tht: chance to entertain visi rors 
(i.e. keep parents happy). With all 
the mommies and daddies arriving 
in [Own, it's a good idea to keep the 
blood sugar up. Our astute admin-

Ins tead of iU>l caring pasta,

yesteryears of second grade and 
glue macaroni onto construction 
paper. Or, if you're feeling a bit 
marc ambiti ous and learned (since 
you've been at big-time, seventh-

incvitably follow, so everyone 's a

December 2: Drop Without

Before the moonless night falls, 
and the campus assumes its night-

.I}' urange glow (UCSD is never 
shrouded in darkness - the li ghts 
at night don't allow it), . students 
have d dire choice to make: drop a 
clas in which teaching assistants 
clearly don't recognize your intel -
ligence, or sntbbornly keep it and 
hope for a miracle on the tlnal. 

A new moon is symbolic of a 
ncw beginning. The acade mic cal-
endar is subtl y telling 5nldents to 
cut their losses.

It is a little-known fact that hia -

invited to open auditions for the 
productions of the 2002-2003 ea-

"There are no restrictions," 
said Walt Jones, chair of depart-

ing the extent of one's involvement 
in the department. Jones encour-

The UCSD Department of 
Theatre and Dance is ranked third 
in the nation . This distinction 
echoes the talent of the faculry, 
many of whom are winners of the 
prestigious Tony Award. Students 
may be more fami liar with the 
work of a department alumnus, 
Benicio Del Toro, who has 
appeared in ~uch critica ll y 
acclaimed films as "Traffic" and 
"Snatch." 

Nevertheless, the excellent 
qualiry of UCSD's theater alone 
should be reason enough to venture 
over to the theater district on the 
south side of ca mpus, where rew 
students travel.

TUESDAY. SEPTEMBER 14, 2002 

Impropriety: 
Good times , 
good music, 
good brew 
continued from page B I 3 

like at any other concert, and 
force your way up front, of course. 

Bad Religion's performance was 
a blistering three-guitar attack; 
after the recent return of former 
guitarist and head of Epitaph 
records, Mr. Brett, there was not 
the typical exod us of one of the 
working six-string pluckers. Theirs 
was, by far, the best set I sawall 
night, and in classical punk format, 
just about everyone in the audience 
was singing along with every word. 
Street Scene veterans Social 
Distortion followed them with a 
crowd-rousing performance, which 
ended the first spectacular day of 
the 19th annual event. And snag-
gin ' picks from Social D. was great, 
since lead singer Mike Ness makes 
the ladies swoon, and hyped-up 
fans will do surprising things for 
memorabilia . 

Saturday was slightly more sub-
dued; the bands seemed geared 
toward a more diverse age group. 
Less punk and rock were present: 
More funk, rap and pop were given 
cen.ter stage. Headlining the main 
stages were Melissa Etheridge and 
The jimi Hendrix Experience on 
one stage, james Brown and 
George Clinton & Parliament 
Funkadelic on another, and Black 
Eyed Peas and Ozomatli on the 
third stage. . 

1 managed to catch part of 
George Clinton's performance, 
but not james Brown's, consider-
ing his start time was delayed 
from 10:30 p.m. to after 11:30 
p.m. Not surprising, really; with 
so many bands and so many 
schedules, a single delay isn '( that 
bad. Overall, the event was hardly 
plagued, though few bands actual-
ly started when they were sup-
posed to begin. 

Friday was by far the biggest 
day, with Saturday closely behind. 
An early estimate reported by The 
San Diego Union Tribune placed 
Friday's attendance at around 
27,000 people, and Saturday with 
a few thousand less. Sunday, on 
the other hand, was comparatively 
sparse, attracting only 16,000 
people. This made the crowds 
much easier to navigate, but also 
meant that the 10- to 12 -year-old 
ca tegory was by far the strongest 
contingent. Sugarcult's sound 
check met with the deafening, 
hig h-pi tched screams of many 
prepubescent gi rl s in studded 
belts. 

T he most unexpec ted treat r 
had was watching Richard Cheese 
and Lounge Against The M achine, 
which does cheesy lounge versions 
of rock and pop songs . Parti cularly 
amusing was the less- than-angst-
ridden version of Rage Against the 
Machine's "Guerrilla Radio" : a 
mellow drawl of "turn that shit 
up." 

The cost of the event undoubt-
edly keep some concert goers away: 
A single day's tickets bought prior 
to the event was $40, two days were 
$70, and for all three, a whopping 
$85 . All that, before you even walk 
in the gates and buy beer, food or 
souvenirs. So perhaps p lanning 
ahead for which hands you want to 
see you would be prudent: Just go 
for one day, get your drink on 
before attending or just save up in 
preparation to purchase a good 
time. 

Overlap performances, prices 
and vision issues aside, once again 
Street Scene forced people out 
into the streets kick.ing and 
screaming and made them have a 
great time in America's Finest 
City. Now all I have to do is try 
and figure out how.I'm going to 
get free passes for next year's 
event .

Coulttsy of Kill Rock Sta~ 
Putting punk in spunk: Carne Bronstein, Janet Weiss and Corin Tucker have 
taken the underground music world by storm with their unique sound. 

Sleater Kinney brings punk 
and riot grrri to the Scene 
Trio of female punk rockers mix humor and 

experimental music for a unique sound 
By JESSICA LlNGEL 

Senior Staff Writer 

A huge part of the charm of a riot grrrl show is the interac-tion between the audience and 
the band. It's an intimate relation-
ship based on the crowd dancing 
furiously, screaming lyric after lyric 
and the musicians responding with 
surprise tracks from the past and 
impromptu solos. Sleater Kinney's 
performance at the Scene on Sept. 
20 was JUSt such a performance, the 
epi [Ome of a punk rock show wi th a 
feminist twist. 

Following nearly two years of 
studio. time and song-writing, 
Sleater Kinney began their 2002 
cross-country tour with a lot of 
expectations [0 fulfill. 

Considered to be one of the 
prodigies of the Olympia, Wash. 
punk scene, the three-member 
band has come to define . the riot 
grrrl movement throughout· its 
nine-year history. Corin Tucker 
(vocals and guitar), Carrie 
Bronstein (guitar) and Janet Weiss 
(dt:ums) followed the performances 
by Shannon Wright and fellow Kill 
Rock Stars labelmates The Bangs, 
the latter playing most of the songs 
off of their newly released EP, "Call 
and Response." 

Punctuated with mishaps and . 
false starts, the one-and-a-half hour 
set took on a

Crowd pleasers and giggle boxes: 
Laughter and mischief define the aura 
of Sleater Kinney's energetic live 
performances. 

The older tracks were particu-
larly fun to hear, since the latest 
album is lacking a bit in the techni-
cal complexity and aggressive tone 
that permeated previous albums 
"All Hands on the Bad One" and 
"The Hot Rock ." Although 
Bronstein performs more as a 
vocalist on "One Beat" than on any 
of the other five collections, instead 
of adding additional layers of musi-
cal intricacy, the effect is too sing-

song, too girly and 
too much like other 
lyric-based music.

solo-rurned piece of its own. That 
kind of energy defined Sleater 
Kinney's stage presence: a lively 
and driving demonstration of a pas-
sion for music. 

Starting off with two new tracks 
off of their sixth album, "One

Sleater Kinney interspersed new

takes some of the quirky aspects of 
former albums, but fails to give 
anything new. 

When the band moves into the 
East Coast portion of the tour, New 
York natives Yeah Yeah Yeahs will 
replace The Bangs as their opener, 
wi th long-time Kill Rock Stars band 
The Quails playing as an additional 
precursor on select dates. The tour 
wraps up in Brooklyn in late 
October, after two solid months of 
performances. Even as the most 
recent album by Sleater Kinney dis-
appoints those who have come to 
expect more from a band that has 
been roclcing the riot grrri scene for 
two decades, their most recent tour-

Disney returns 
to its classic 
form in 'Tuck 
Everlasting' 

The film based on 
the ch ildrens book 
adually resembles a 
true Disney picture 

By ANNE CONCi-HUYEN 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

Who docsn't remember the classic book "Tuck Everlasting" by atalie 
Babbitt that was so enchanting in 
elementary school? The theme 
introduced in the book and now 
captured in a Disney film of the 
same name is a familia r one : mor-
tality and fear of it. 

In "Tuck," a young girl , Wi nnie 
Foster (Alexis Bledel), breaks the 
constraints of her stuffy life and 
encounters a young man aonathan 
Jackson) and his fami ly, the Tucks 
(Sissy Spacek, William Hurt and 
Scott Bairstow). She discovers that 
the family is immortal; then , like all 
good fiction, she must make the 
decision of her life between staying 
with the Tucks forever or returning

REVIEW 

to the world she didn 't really like to 
begin with . 

The brea thtak ing American 
wilderness serves as the backdrop 
for the film , bringing the audience 
back to the days before big 
metropolises, noise and pollution . 
The lifestyle of living like time 
does n 't exi st depicted by the 
Tucks evokes feelings of despon-
dency in those who realize that 
life really docs pass by too damn 
quickJy. 

Minute detai ls of particular 
period facts like dress, rules of pro-
priety and technological advances 
are accurate and nostalgic . .The 
sweet and naive countenance of 
Bledel, in her turn of the century 
Ilowy dresses and long braided 
hair, in addition to her re lationship 
with the Tucks, depicts an II1n o-
cence and charm that is lost in so 
Illany modern fil ms, espec iall y 
ones mea nt for chi ldren . But 
Wi nnie inevitably grows out of her 
chi ld ish headstrong independence 
and reali zes what's important (this 
1'< a Disney movie, for goodness 
sakes!). 

"Tuck Everlasting" is the first 
Disney film in a long time to actu-
ally resemble what Wal t Dlsncy 
himself would have produced. It> 
philosophical and somewhat 
mature theme is scarce in many 
popular films today, when slapstick 
comedie and explosive action 
movies arc the big box office draws. 
But either way, thiS movie will 
eventually become a family classic 
like MOld Yeller" or "The Swiss 
Family Robinson," and if not, the 
cute guys will at least make it pop-
ular with hormone-crazed teeny-
boppers. 

But don 't let the litde kids and 
teenage gi rls scare you away from 
seeing a fi lm worthy of the Disney 
name . Don't worry, we won't think 
less of you.

Yay for Germans! Why? 

Because they gave us Oktoberfest 
And lucky for us, we don't have to 
be in Germany to celebrate it. We 
need on~ go as far as Encinitas. 
Everything from the Bluebirds 
Oom-Pah-Pah Band, polkas and 
bratwurst will delight the many 
people who attend this five-block 
festival. Of course, there will be 
plenty of foods, games, rides so it 
will be a fun place to go whether 
you have kids or whether you just 
like to act like one. But don't 
worry. There is also a playground
