Brown ~gnores PSEC's 
Salary Increase Proposal 

by Patti Wolf 
A lower salary and fringe benefit increase than requested for 

California's instructors of higher education was the recommendation 
presented to the State Legislature as a result of Governor Brown setting 
a!>lde a procedur.e developed by the Po t Se ondary Education 
Comml sion (PSEC) (0 determine salary lev Is . 

Brown, following the recomm ndations of the State Per onnel Board 
rather than the proposals of the PSEC, asked for an across-the-board 
increase of 8.5 percent for all state employees . The PSEC had 
recommended an 11.75 percent raise for university instructors. 

" The main objection is not with 
the figure," said UC San Diego 
Academic Senate Chairman Dr. 
Avrum Stroll, " but the fact that 
the agreed upon procedure was 
not followed." 

Use of Formubt 
The procedure, which had 

taken several years to create, is 
the use of a formula comparable 
to others utilized by such in-
stitutions as Stanford and 
Michigan . The PSEC , whose 
membership includes a com-
mittee of the state legislature, the 
Governor's office, and A . Alan 
Po t , legislative analyst for the 
state, is charged with syn -
th sizing all relevant information, 
including salary levels at other 
schools, adding a n inflation factor 
and reporting to the Governor the 
amount he should propose to the 
state legislature. 

One possible explanation for 
the use of State Personnel Board 
figures and not those of the PSEC 
aid Stroll , is that the new 

governor is unaware of the 
procedure. 

Th procedure had been 
formulated and approved by 
former Governor Ronald Reagan . 

However, at the meeting of the 
UC Regent January 17, Brown 
told the board that he was aware 
of the procedure, but chose not 
to accept the PSEC proposals 
b Cd use of their fiscal un-
soundness. He told the board that 
UC could not gauge its salary 
levels to those at other in-
titutions, including private 

co lleges , " that are having 
troubles of their own ."

Bus Fare 
Kept at 25' 
Temporarily 

The City Council decided 
Thursday to spend bus company 
and other transportation reserves 
in order to keep the 25 cent fare 
on all San Diego Transit buses 
until June 30. 

No one knows, however, what 
the bus company will do in July, 
wh n the reserve money will b 
p nt. 

10 cent Jumpl 
The ci ty-owned bus company 

reported late last year that it was 
facing a $1 .2 million deficit by 
the end of this fiscal year, and 
said that an increase in fare to 35 
c nts would be one possible 
measure to alleviate the deficit. 
However, most counci lmen , 
along with Mayor Wilson, have _ 
opposed such an increaSE!. 

The council action approved 
the use of all $500,000 in transit 
corporation pension reserves and 
$300,000 in depreciation reserves, 
plus $287 ,000 in city tran -
sportation reserves . 

However, a motion from a 
ouncilman asking that the 
ouncil state its desire, as a 

matter of policy, to retain the 25 
cent fare for the new fiscal year 
beginning July 1 was deadlocked 
at four to four . 

As a result, bus company of-
ficials will present t001975-1976 
budgets to the council : one with 
a 25 cent fare, and the second 
with a 35 cent fare. 

Natural Seepage Blamed 

Third's Academic Unit One is proceeding handily. 

3rd Apartnlent Bids In 
by David Cassidy 

Bids from six companies are in for the Third College Resident 
Halls contract. 

The townhouse structures will consist of one, two, and three 
bedroom self-c:ontain d units, with upstairs and downstairs levels, 
bath room and kitchen, living room and out-door patio. 

The apartments will be arranged in small clusters, separated by 
landscape and the natural geography of the site. The exterior will be 
a combination of wood stucco in warm earthy tones, according to 
A.W. Russ, Third College Business Manager. 

Because the apart~nts have kitchens, there will be a short order 
snack bar instead of a student cafeteria. Student living in the 
apartments will also have the option of meal plan services. 

Turnkey Project 
The complex will be a "turnkey project," which means the 

University specifies what the units should contain and individual 
contractOR submit bids an(j designs. The project is awarded to the 
contractor with the best plans. 

The companies bidding for the contracts are: G .L. Carey, 
Raymond-A.W. Whitwers, Riha Construction Co., L.J . Hinterman, 
W. M. Simpson, and Canahan Brothers. -

Third College's first permanent teaching facilities, Academic Unit 
One, are scheduled for completion in the beginning of 1976. The 
Resident halls will open in the fa ll of 1975. 

tn addition to the new apa rtments, 200 units will be constructed 
soon near the Mesa apartments complex east of the main campus. 
Mesa now houses only graduate and marrie<Atudents, but the new 
150 units can be used to house undergraduate students. Those 200 
units, also a "turnkey project," will be completed in September. 

Student Directory Will 
Not Appear in May 

A group of five students em-
ployed by the cart'\pus in-
formation center has formed to 
publish a student directory that 

'one member of the group 'says 
will be " almost like a yearbook ." 

Oil Slick Reported Off Santa Barbara 

8ccording to Bart Blakenfeld, 
the directory will be published 
late in February or the beginning 
of March, in sharp contrast to 
past years when the directory 
appeared in May. _ 

Blakenfeld said the previous 
directory was prin ed by a firm in 
Texas, and that the lateness had 
been the result of various 
logistical problems. 

The Coast Guard Thursday 
reported a heavy oil slick, ap-
parently from natural seepage, 
about five miles off the coast, 
ranging from Gaviota, 35 miles 
north of Santa Barbara, to 
Summerland, fiv miles south . 

Lt. Terrence O'Connell , head of 
the Santa Barbara Coast Guard 
office described the slick as 
"several miles long, up to a mile 
wide--and it's solid oiL" 

O'Connell said the heaviest 
concentration was at a point west 
of Platform Holly, off Goleta, 
extending out to sea (rom Union 
Oil Co .'s Platform A. 

He said the oil was not very 
close to the platform . 

"We don't have any reason to 
believe any of this stuff is coming 
from any of the platforms," h 
said . "We've checked with each 
one of them. 

The directory, in addition to 
containing home and school 
add res es and phone numbers, 
will have a 2()..page ection 
devoted to photography, poetr 
and prose . Also, the directory will 
accept 3D-word p ronal ad-

COYOTE CONTROL 
Carlos Castaneda calls him my'stical and speaks of h is great wisdom. 

Native American mythology points to his kindness, his magic and his 
guileless love of man . National Geographic lauds his sophisticated 
social structure, his non-aggressive temperament and his undaunted 
will to survive. He is the cousin of the wolf and the domestic dog. He is 
a vita l link in the reciprocal bonds of environmental ecology. He is the 
beautiful, somewhat timid, much misunderstood coyote. And, today, 
as so frequently in his past, he is in danger-from Man. 

The subject of "coyote control" is once again being heard 
throughout San Diego County Because of three complaints , based 
more upon ignorance than legitimacy, the Board of Supervisors is 
considering countywide reinstatement of the barbaric steel-jawed 
traps. These brutal devices bear the promise of torturous death or 
p rmanent maiming to their victims They indiscriminately slam shut 
around the tiny limbs and bodies of coyotes, rabbits, squirrel , op-
pusum, foxes, racoons and housepets . They constitute one more 
vicious rem inder of Man's insensitivity to his environmental om-
pan ions. 

Of course, much of the motivation behind the trapping IS related to 
misunderstanding about the coyote and his role in the environment. 
Many people, for example, equate the term "predator" With 
" aggressive, dangerous beast." They believe that the coyote, because 
he is a predator, constitutes a real threat to humans as well ; however, 
this is not the case In fact, Bill Huskey, Executive Director of the 
Escondido Humane Society, says that there is not one known incident 
of a coyote assaulting a human in San Diego County . 

As for the reputed coyote massacres of domestic pets and livestock, 
the rate of attack has been highly exaggerated. It is true that oc-
casionally, and for various reasons, coyotes do get at these animaL~ ; 
however, it is frequently because the pets have been allowed to roam 
into coyote territory or have not been properly contained by their 
owners. Contrary to popular opinion, coyotes do not tend to be so bold 
as to leap fences and make off with prized livestock . Nor are they 
propelled by an insatiable lust to kill for pleasure. 

The sorry result of this misinformation and careless thinking is the 
scapegoating of the coyote . On the basis of occasional incidents, he is 
blamed for the disappearance of far too many domestic animals . What 
isn't realized is that his diet is 90 percent mice-an abundant com-
modity in these parts-and he generally does not need to ravage the 
human rea lm. If for no other reason than h is natural statu s as rodent 
controller, he is important. But he is much more than that ; he is an 
intelligent, lovely animal who lives in a well-structu red socia l system 
where he shares the responsibilities of territorial defense and the 
rearing of cubs. He is important, too, for his place in the folklore of the 
United States and Mexico. He is a vital living creat.ure who certai nly is 
not deserving of brutal ity . 

For those who contend that there is a serious "coyote problem" let 
me suggest that there are far more humane methods of control. One of 
these is the use of box traps which catch the ani mal , painlessly, en-
closing it securely until it can be removed to a desirable area and 
released . Certainly, this is far preferable to torture and killing. 

The decision on the use of steel jawed traps will not be rendered for 
some time yet. Meanwhile, people on both sides of the question are 
working diligently on their concerns. I ask that you add your name to 
the lists of citizens who recogn ize the inhumanity of the steel jawed 
traps and who advocate tbeif being outlawed. Within t he week, there 
will be an on-campus display of the traps, including information on 
their uses and hazards. We expect that the display will ci rculate to 
each of the UCSD colleges in order to be viewed by as many people as 
possible. Please come by and sign the petition or contact me at 453-
8326 for further informat ion .

Locker Room 
I was e)(tremely shocked and 

angered by an annoying incident 
which took place in the women's 
locker room in the gym January 
20, at approximately 8:00 p.m. A 
male was found hiding behind a 
row of lockers, enjoying a free 
peep show. Another woman 
discovered him and forced him to 
leave by humiliating and em-
brassing him in no uncertain 
terms . 

Because UCSo has been an 
extremely safe campus compared 
to other universities, I personally 
have had no fear of walking alone 
at night between campuses. Thus 
I took this incident as merely an 
unpleasant and unhappy result of 
a warped mind . However, upon 
conferring with two bystanders, I 
learned that this was not an 
unique incident ; there have been 
frequently many other similar 
problems in the past, involving 
males " m istakenly" walking into 
the women 's locker room. 

I do not think th at we here at 
UCSD can rectify problems 
caused by a society which would 
motivate males to seek such a 
diversion through an invasion of 
personal privacy, but I do

~. D. Cards 
Again, you fail to see the main 

point. The central issue in the 
"Picture 1.0. Card" affair is the 
responsibility of the ad-
ministration to solicit student 
input and approval of the system 
prior to dumping the finished 
product, and its cost to us 
students. A token student on a 
corflmiUee is not "consulting the 
students," and since the Registrar 
is coordinating the development 
of the card program, he is in an 
excellent position to solicit 
approval from the student body 
through registration packet 
questionnaires. He should do so . I 
might add that Dr. McElroy's 
"student committee .. . to obtain 
student approval" is a tardy and 
rath er expedient measure to add 
legitimacy to the whole project , 
perhaps after several letters from 
the student representative asked 
for the Reg packet referendum. 

Student s, be aware! The cost 
and secu rity problems of the 
ards are minor harassments 

compared to other, more fun-
damental issues of educational 
change, yet outcry must be 
rais d .

The questions are excerpts 
from the University Residence 
Environment Scale, and an\wers-
co llected from students across 
the United States- provide a 
variety of valuable data con-
cerning the effects of Â· dor-
mitory life on our campuses. 

The scale was developed and 
tested by Marvin S. Gerst , 
Assistant Professor in the 
Department of Psychiatry at the 
UC San Diego Medical School. 
Gerst worked in collaboration 
with Rudolf Moos of Stanford 
University. 

" Probably the most striking 
experience upon en tering a new 
Situation is our perceptiolf of the 
psychological atmosphere or 
climate," Gerst said . "We may see 
it as warm or cold, friend ly or 
hostile I was interested in

along tt'n dlmt'n Ion s' in -

dependen e. traditional social 
o ri entation , co mpetition , 
ilc ademic achievement, in -
te llectuality, order and 
o rganization , innovation , and 
student influence . The 

psychometric properties of the 
scale have proved to be excellent 
and substantive comparisons 
such as large versus small 
residences, one-sex dormitories 
versus coed dormitories 
demonstrate that the scale is 
sensitive to programmatic and 
compositional difference. 

" Sex composition does make 
an important difference in 
student hOUSing," Gerst said. "My 
studies show that people living in 
coed dormitories feel that their 
houses have better ciarity and 
organization , that they are more 
supportive, more intenectually 
oriented and more innovative." 

Gerst feels that women in this 
particular age group tend to put 
more em phasis on the 
development of friendships than 
m n, who are more traditionally 
achievement and independence 
oriented . " In a sense," he ex-
plained , "Coed dormitories gain a 
combination of advantages found 
in both single-sex dormitories. 
Many of the coed houses we 
tested showed a high emphasis on 
academic achievement, but the 
push for grades seemed to be 
balanced by a good deal of 
tudent interaction and support." 

Dormitories with lower degrees of 
perceived competition 'and in-
dependen e were generally 
environments where the residents 
felt friendlier, happier and more 
at ase A high independence 
score indicated an atmosphere 
where people tended to be un-
concern ed and somewhat callous 
of the feelings of others. 

Although his scale did not deal 
directly with exual behavior in 
copd dormitories, Gerst com-
mented on the subject . " Intitally, 
sexua l activity is lower in coed 
houses- omething that can be 

attributed to the fact that it takes 
a certain amount of titTle to 
develop a culture where people 
can deal with living together and 
relating heterosexually . Current 
data shows that the amount of 
sex ual ac tivity among co ed 
dormitory residents is just about 
the same as it is among any other 
college-age group. There's a 
popular not ion that a brother-
sister relationship develops in 
coed dorms along with a kind of 
incest taboo . This simply isn't 
true ." 

Gerst believes that more 
considerat ion should be given to 
socia l organization than to the 
architecture of size of dor-
mitories . Although large dor-
mitories are less. expensive than 
suite arrangements or cluster 
housing to bui ld and staff, Gerst's 
studies how that size makes 
relatively little difference as far as 
stud ent'S relationships are 
concerned . By defining "my 
dorm" as "my floor or hallway," 
students seem to create social 
units in large dormitories much as 
they would form groups in small 
boarding houses. Gerst noted that 
a student's perception of design 

Brown Ignores PSEC 

and architecture is strongly In-
fluenced by his perception of the 
emot ional quality inside the 
building . He may describe his 
dorm itory as " ugly and 
depressing" in appearance if he 
feels uncomfortable as a resident. 
The same building may be 
perceived as more pleasing and 
att ra ctive by someone who 
enjoys !tis living arrangement. 

" I would stress alloti ng money 
to the development of an ex-
celle!)t dorm staff, and not be 
concerned with things like the 
effects of modular furniture and 
the color of hallways," Gerst said . 
"We want to maximize a dor-
mitory environment where 
people feel good about them-
selves/ where they can form 
relationsh ips - more easily, be 
more flexible and productive." 

Gerst believes that good 
dormitory personnel are essential 
to the development of such an 
environment, and that they 
should be people who are highly 
sensitive to the issues students 
deal with on a daily basis They 
should be capable of acting as 
resource people and cata lysts in 
organizing social action program

one of severa l teacher's unions,
