and privacy concerns, UC official s 
released Friday the tran cript of an 
illegal closed meeting, where the 
univerlotity 's auditors detailed 100

Officials released the 22- page 
transcript, covering the Nov. 14 re-

Kissing Booth as Part of 'Day of Action' 
AWARENESS: UCSA is 
pushing for sy temwide 
domestic-partner benefits 
By Julia Kulla-Mader 
Guardian Reporter 

Several campus organi zations co-sponsored a 
kissing booth in the Pri ce Center on Tuesday as 
part of the University of California Student 
Association 's (UCSA) Day of Action. 

"Every campus has some sort of visibility 
campaign," said Alex T. Tom, UCSD's Associ -
ated Students (A.S.) vice pre ident for ex ternal 
affairs. "It is either going to be a kissing booth or 
a [same- exl wedding." 

UCSA, Student Affirmative Action Commit-
tee (SAA ), Graduate Student Association (GSA), 
UCSD Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender 
Association (LGBTA) and A.S. External Affair 

Office all contributed to UCSD 's event. 
A.S. ampus Office Director Arzo Mansury 

sa id Ihe goal of the Day of Action was to "put 
domestic partnership in the forefront. " 

According to a UCSA nyer distributed at the 
event , the designation "domesti c partner" is gen-
era lly defined as "two people who share a primary 
rcsidence, are financially and emotionally inter-
dependent, and have an intimate relationship in-
cluding a commitment to caring for each other' 
needs." 

Mansury aid the Day of Action was part of a 
quarter- long campaign to pressure UC President 
Richard Atkinson and the UC Board of Regents 
into ex tending spousal benefits to dome tic part-
ners. 

·'UC regents have becn debating the domestic 
partnership iSsue for 20 years," Tom said. "This is

History 
LITIGATION: Supreme 
Court shot down 
longstanding precedent 
By Paul Dodge 
Staff Writer 

Linda Brown Hende r 'on and Cheryl 
Brown Thompson, the litigants in the monu-
mental Supreme ourt case that ended legal 

~egregation in public ~chools, gave first -
hand accounts Monday of their cxperiences 
being the Browns in the landmark Brown v. 
Board of Edllcalioll case . 

The Brown sisters, schoolchildren at the 
timc of the 1954 ruling, lectured Monday 
morning during Dimensions of Culture 
classes and held an open dialoglJc later that 
day at the ros~ 1Iiturai Center. 

Both arc daughtcrsofthe late Rev. Oliver 
L. Brown who, along with 12 other families 
In the fall of 1951 , filed ~Ull in Topeka. 

Kan~as on behalf of hi s children aga inst the 
loca l boa rd of education . 

Led by lawyer from the al10nal As~o­
clation for the Advancement of Co lored 
Peoplc( AA P), Brown and thcother fami -
lies had simultaneously tri ed to enrollthw 
children in al I-white schools acros~ the city. 
All of them were rejec ted because of their 
race. 

The NAACP, along with then-lawyer 
Thurgood Mar hall, used the evidence to 
bring the case to the Supreme Court. There 
it was combined with cases from Delaware, 
South Carolina, Virginia and Washington, 
D. ., to form the officia l case, Oliver L. 
BrolVll, el ai, v. The Boord of Educatioll of 
Topeka Kansas, el al. 

In an unanimous decision , the courl ulti -
mately overturned the 50-year-old prece-
dent of "separate but equal" laid down in thc 
1896 Plessy v. Ferguson case. 

The sisters shared their personal storics 
and various recollections, trying to educate 
the audience about the history of the case. 

"We are proud to be have been a part of 
opening the doors of education to every-
one," Hender on said. "1 think it is impor-
lantto educate everyone about the true his-
tory of the ca e in order to stay true to its

UCSD Has Much to be 
Proud of Scholastically 

Academic Ii fe at U SO is not easy. M ost of us at 
UCSO work harder than our counterparts at other univer-
sitil:s in California, including the C system. It 's not 
unusual to have to fight for a place to study in the library 
- even on weekends. 

Stre~sed-out students can take comfort that their efrort~ 
will payoff, however. Hour~ of cramming for midterms 
will someday result in a diploma to be valued by future 
employers, graduate and profcs!>oional schools. U SO's rep-
utation as a hard-core academic in~titution is rising to IllCl.:t 
the challenge po!>ocd by ~chools !>ouch as Harvard or Yal e. 

U SO repeatedly rankl> highly among U.S. universitics. 
The U SO School of Engineering, for example, recently 
ranked ninth nationwide in a su rvey conducled by the 
Nalional Academy of Scicncl:s. The Bioengineering 
Depanment was ranked first, winning a spot on the 
pedestal nexi to the notoriously snooty Massachusetts 
Inslitutc of Technology. 

We owe this reputation in part to the vast resource~ 
available to us, including an experienced and elite faculty 
- which boasts the first U.S. female astronaut, Sally 
Ride, among its members. 

Whil e it's true that UCSO can be somewhat anti-social, 
and that our alumni often recall more hours spent in the 
lab than at wild parties, we shouldn ' t complain . 

Instead of whining and groaning as we students heft our 
backpacks across campus to one of UCSO 's several 
libraries, we should remember that we are merely earning 
our place among greatness. 

Regents Made Bad Call 
In Closed Session 

A f'ew weeks back, we reported that Student Regent Jess 
Bravin was intentionally excluded from this year's Student 
Regent Selection Committee because o f' bad blood between 
him and Regents Roy Brophy and Tirso del Junco. 

Although Bravin has had tcnse relations with some 
board members thi s year, an incident that occurred late last 
year was the rt:ason that Brophy and del Junco acted so 
vituperatively. Bravin objected to a discussion of the finan-
cial health of' the university that occurred during a closed 
session of the U Board of Regents. State law requires that 
any discussion about the financial health of the university 
be conducted during an OP(;1l session of the board. 

Bravin's objectioll has since b~en unequivocally vindi -
cated . After proddi ng by journal ists from the Sail 
Francisco Chrollicle and thl.! Sacramenro Bee, the board 
released a transcript of the meeting in which they dis-
cussed the financial health or the university. 

It's a shame that Regen ts Brophy and del Junco had to 
be forced to obey the law. As regenls, they should under-
stand that they arc no dirferent from any other appointed 
offkials, who all must swear an oath to uphold the laws of 
the state of California . 

The UC Board of Regents is current ly filled with polit i-
ca l insiders who apparently think that they are above the 
law. This must change, The state commission charged with 
investigating possible reforms ror Ca li fornia's constitution 
has recently recommended that UC regents not continue to 
be appointed for absurdly long 12-year terms. This will 
help ensure that people appDinteci to the board are not just 
interested in reaping Ihe benefits of politicul p<ltronage on 
the part of the governor, but in helping guide the greatest 
public university sy~ tell1 in the world. 

Regent Bravin 's integrity in this matter should be 
applauded to the same degree that the heavy-handedness 
of Regents Brophy and del Junco should be c ndemned.

O.J. Simpson chase or 1994? 

The media forced the nation's 
eyes to watch as AI "A.C." 
Cowlings chaurfeured Simpson in 
his white Ford Bronco, leading up 
to what has heen called ''The Tria l 
or thl! Cl!ntury." Meanwhik, San 
Diego watched as a pony-tailed, 
36-year-old man who sti ll lives 
with his mothcr screamed that hI! 
took the bus because "There ha ve 
been a couple of deaths; two cats 
got killed up Ihl! street."

the nation 's rinest newspaper, cov-
ering his story, Taylor has the inept 
Union- Tribulle, with all its gram-
matical errors, misinrormation and 
design problems. 

Taylor. unlike Simpson, will not 
have a positive eeonomic impact 
on San Diego's tourbm industry. 
That's Sun Diego's legacy : never

San Diego has a roller coaster in Mis 'ion Beach that 
no one ever rides. They have Hollywood, the Sunset

In a worst -case scenario. Bravin 
said regents and university ofJiciab 
could be conspiring to com;eal pub-
lic information and protect their 
repul<ltion ~ . 

However. UC General ounsel 
Jim Holst said Bravin was mistaken. 

ACl:ording to Holst. the poor 

quality or the meeting tape made 
preparing a transcript difficult. Sev-
eral speakers were in the audience 
rar from any microphones. render-
ing their voices almost unintelli -
gible. 

"It was a rairl y l aboriou~ pro-

Hobt sa id hi . offi ce then took 

"considerable time in reViewing the

"I won' t tell you how many time,

However, Holst said he didn 't 
fee l pressured to delay or withhold 
the transcript.

unusual for an operation thi s com-
plex." Malaspina ~l1 id . 

According to Anne Broome, 
UC' ~ associate vi ce president for 
busines~ and finance. the prublems 
stem from contracts UC medical 
centers have wllh insurers to be re-
i mbur~ed for care at reduced rates. 

"Any medical cenlen ;ould have 
as many as 250 contract rates," 
Broome said . 

The difrerent rates were improp-

rl 

erly recorded at the UC Davis, Los 
Angeles and San Francisco medical 
centers. resulting in the $70 million 
adjuslment. UCSD 's procedure for 
recording the different reimburse-
ment rates was correct, Broome said. 

Broome ~aid tbe reduced rates

betwo.:en hospital~ for patients.

While the auditor, didn ' t find 
any illegal accounting practi ces. the 
auditors warned the regents several 

tlme~ oflhe university's inadequate 
financial procedures. 

"We want you to know that we 
have very serious concerns about 
the accounting and the financial 
controls at the University of Cali-
fornia." said Deloitle& Touche pan-
ncr Rich Fineberg. 

The auditors questioned the ef-
rectiveness or the university 's de-
centralized and redundant account-
ing systems, as well as the size and 
purpose of gcneral reserve funds at 
the five UC medical centers.

"Management needs to be more 
disciplined about monitoring the 
level of these reserves and more 
imponantly not building them up 
just 10 avoid reponing larger bottom 
lines in these medical centers," 
Deloitle & Tou L: he auditor Ken 
Weixel sa id . 

Some rege nts expressed thclr 
concem with the data the auditor, 
provido.:d . 

" In other words, these medical 
center~ are m a stronger positi on 
financially than we think"!" Regent 
Gerald Parsky asked. 

'That's one message," Weix el 
sa id. 

"Right now you ha ve pulled the 
rug from underneath us with regard 
to our judgment of the financial per-
formance of those centers. I fee l," 
Regent Peter Preuss said later in the 
di scussion . 

However, Bill Gunner. UC's vice 
president for clinical services de-
velopment. said the numbers "re-
flect what we believe is a legitimate 
reflection of the economic viability 
of the organization." 

The meeting took place the day 
before the regents voted to approve 
the highly contentious UCSF-
Stanford merger of clinical activi -
ties.

SISTERS: 
Browns discuss their

Continued from page 1 
have the tools to keep it from 
repeating itse lf," Thompson 
added. 

The Brown children lived in a 
racially-mixed neighborhood and 
played with chi Idren of other races 
on a dai Iy basis. However, the 
others were able to attend the all-
white school only fOUf blocks from 
the Brown house. 

The si sters had to walk several 

miles across town to catch a bus 
that look them even further to the 
"colored" school. The immediate 
harm of racial segregation was a 
long and potentially dangerous trek 
through train yards and alleys, but 
Henderson said the erfecls of seg-
regation ran much deeper. 

"It's about respect and self es-
teem," she said. "It was never an 
iss ue of quality between the 
schools. It wasjust the simple fact 
that the schools were separate .... " 

The sisters ' talks rocused on

cluding school closings in the 
Sout h 10 prevent integration, the 
"whi te flight" from the suburbs, 
busing, the "bell-curve theory" and 

the fighl over arfirmative action. 
The sis lers said Ihat while the 

overall impact of the ease into 
which their fat her put so much 
work has been good, it has been 
these effects- and the media -
that have that have led to regres-
sion in anti -segregation efforts. 

"The media like it simple and 
many times they would portray 
the case as the efforts or only a few 
lawyers or individuals, while it 
WitS the goal of many fami lies and 
organilati ons," Thompson said . 
"Now we have begun to regress.

Still, both Browns said they 
recognize the importance of the 
case. 

" II was the first time a case was 
handed down from Ihe Supreme 
Court that was true to what the 
14th Amendment really intended," 
Henderson said.

Misery, not love, all 
too common on 
Valentine's Day 
By Nicole Vargas 
Sentor Slaff Wmer 

II all slarled on Feh. 14. 
1990. 

I wa~ in Ihe ~cvc nlh 
grade al a ~ mall grade 
chool in Los Angcle, 

County and proud 10 say I 
had landed an older man 1fl 
thc eighlh grade. 

I nstead of spend mg the 
day wilh "Chris," though. I 
spent it with a ball I.: of Cal-
adryll and a severe casc of 
thc chickcn pox. 

Amazingly. Ihal parlicu-
lar Valentinc 's Day wasn ' t 
cven my worst. 

I am a linn heliever th:lI 
nothing good can happen to 
me on Valentine's Day, The 
fact that February 14 is <I 
day devoted to sharing love 
and chocolate ' with that 
pecial someone doesn't 

mailer , to me. and judging 
by my ~rack record, it docs· 

n' t cven apply. 
After al l. in thc I<lst six 

ycars I have managed to get 
dumpcd, deathly ill . forgot-
ten and stood up - all on 
Fcbruary 14. 

Don ' t get me wrong. I 
love the idca of having a 
specIal day for my man and 
me. bur frum my cxperi -
enccs, Valentinc's Day isn 't 
if. This having bcen said. 
allow me to share somc 
highlighls of my past mi s-
fortunes. 

My first Valcntinc 's Day 
in high school was sup-
posed to be a great day for 
my steady. "Alex," and me. 
I arrived at my locker 
before first period. giddily 
expecting to find flowers or 
balloons, 

Jnslead, I found a note 
wilh the infamous line, "We 
need to talk." Needless to

Love on the net: 
Disastrous matches 
found on the 'net 
By "Huggy Bear" 
Sentor Slaff Wriler 

Much media ullenti on 
ha~ rccenl I y b\!cn ~howered 
on di scovaing "love" 
whilc surfing the net. This 
week 's Unioll -TribulIl' ran 
a focus piece illuminating 
such "cnchanted" encoun-

tcr~ . 
Most people, including 

myself. would probahly 
dismiss such a phenome-
non. thinking that computer 
" Iovc" is for people who 
have no live~ . Or maybe 
we 'd wonder who would be 
careless enough 10 take 
!lirting un-line one slep fur-
ther, making il il re .. hly. 

However, before I knew 
it. I had innocently joined 
the freaks who thought they 
might have found "love on 
Ihe nel." Of coursc I never 
associated myself with 
Ihose cases that you see on 

latc- night talk ~how~ ~uc h 
as krry Springer or Genll -
do. I was much smarter 
than that (wink. wink .) 

Apparently it was 11m 
type of Ihinking that led lIle 
to experience the "weekcnd 
from hell ." 

I hud met "Lowercase" 
on an on-line channel thai 
fo(:Used mainly on mu~ic 
and other related topics. 
"Lowercase" and I found 
that we both liked Ihe same 
exact band~ . frequently 
allended show~ and spent a 
good amount of our pay-
check at the record store. 

Evcntually, we decided 
to leave the channel on 
which our "friends" 
remained. and began talk -
Ing on our own, pri valC 
channel.

The Offspring 
Ixnay on the Hombre 

Columbl. 

-.. 

In 1994, the Orange County 
runk band the OlTsrring stormcd 
on to the music scene wilh it · 
breakthrough albunl, SlIIa.l·h, seil-
ing cight-and-a-half million cories 
and spawning two top-40 si ngles. 
On its major-label debut , Lmay 011 
The lIumbre. released on Columbia 
Records. the ba nd allempts to break 
ncw mu ica l ground but ends up 
with a messy conglomeration of 
rehashed tunes. 

The Offspring swerves from one 
genre to the next on !xnay, combin-
ing punk, ska, '80s-rock and dance 
music with a twist of grunge angst. 
Many different inlluences are evi-
dent on the album, most notably the 
Jane's Addiction ripoff. "Me And 
My Old Lady," and "Amazed," a 
carbon copy of any Bush song. 

Ixnay On The Hombre docs 
have a few standout tracks - "The 
Meaning Of Life" and the first sin-
gle, "All I Want," are some of the 
band's hardest, while "Mota" di s-

plays the pop sensibi lity that made 
the Offspring radio darlings. 

Despite its styli sti (; schizophre-
nia, Ixnay docs show the talent and 
complex thinking of the band. The 
Offsrring work best on the less 
melodramatic tracks, offering 
humorous takes on real life deliv-
ered through chunky gui tar ri ITs 
and hallllonizing, anthem-like vocals. 

The lack of stabi lity and organi -
lalion on the album prevents it from 
being Ihe revolutionary re(;ord II 
attempts to be. Although I).na), 0" 
The HUlllbre has Its moments, it 
shows that the Offsrring arc more 
conceilled with making a hit than a 
statement.

-
,.,.,. 

The Chicago-based foursome 
Veruca alt won nOlable attention 
and respect after the tremendous 
success of thei r hit si ngle, 
"Seether," off of their 1994 debut , 
American Thighs. The band 's latest 
release, Eight Amls to Hold YOII . i -
destined 10 share simi lar acclaim. 

The band's name ake is the 
bratty young girl from Roald 
Dahl's C/wriie and the Chocolate 
Factory. The innuence of such 
childhood fantasy is made apparent

Hard-driving guitars and J lead 
si nger shouting out rhyme to a fast 
paced beat. Heavy metal/rap fusi n 
a la Rage Against the Mac hine, but 
without all the political baggage. 

For those of you who think the 
only guod thing that comes out of 
Gilroy is the garli c festival, there 's 
a new group on the cene th at cou ld 
have you forgetting the stinking 
rose. Salmon 's debut album, 
Paco ... Drop the Chicken. follows 
upon the trail blazed by Rage and 
3 I I, where they hope to gain fans 
who enjoy the newl y- popular 
metal/rap fusion sound. 

Paco ... Drop the Chicken, like 

------------------------------

thc debut albums or many bands, 
has one basic speed and mood 
prcvalent th roughout. For Salmon. 
that mood is hard and that race is 
fust. The hand doesn't take a break 
on uny of the tracks. Even when 
kat! si nger Lawrence Martinel 
start s out ,lowly, guitul'ist Aaron 
Goodwin is wa it ing to spring his 
ITh:tal rirfs a few bars down the 
line. 

The lyrics are most ly ~implistic 
rhymes , reminiscent of a 101 or the 
rap musi, out there today. Such 
lines as "Plop, plop, lill, rilli 
Plea~e sti,k your nose in~idc my 
hi!.," from Ih l: tra,~ "Bantam-
burgh" and "Little like th"l ju,t 
make Illy ass ticktodU Like a ciOl:k 
(,n an old pine blockl Cheddar 
wou ld be better. that 's why 1 got a 
crock" from "The Knack" arc rer-
resentative of the lyrica l sophistica-
tion one can expec t from Pacu. 

Overall , Salmon 11:15 produced 
an enjoyable Ii rst effort that anyone 
into the mClal/rap fusion sound 
should chcck out.

Years laler "Alex" and I can 
laugh ahoul the whole episode. 
Yeah. I was incredibly hUrl and I 
am a lillie biller abou l being 
dumped on Valenline 's DilY, but al 
leasl he didn'l give me Ihe dead 
rose he had brought for me. 

Arter thai experience, I became 
very wary of steady boyfriends and 
whal they brought to my self-
esteem. A year later Ihough, I found 
a new guy named "Mall" and we 
were inseparable for the nexl two-
and-a-half years. 

Now, I know what you ' re think-
ing: "If she had a boyfriend for 
over Iwo yea rs, Ihen she must have 
had al least IWO good Valentine 's 
Days." Wrong. 

However, the next 
year he not only 
forgot a gift, but he 
managed to forget . 
the whole holiday 
altogether. Although 
"Matt" tried to hide 
his blunder by 
offering to take me 
to see his favorite 
basketball' team a 
month later, the 
feeling Just wasn't 
the same.

So. I wailed. and wailed, and 

wailed. Then I wailed some more. 
Then I went 10 bed, incredibly 
depressed. 

The nexi day. my friend called, 
and lold me how much fun he had 
Ihe nigh l before wilh his friends. It 
seemed like he had forgotten hi s 
orfer to include me. When I men-
tioned my hunch. I was lold, "I did-

The funny thing is thai il did 
mean that much to me and I was 
upset because Ihe firsl lime I had 
eve r been siood up had to be on 
Valenline's Day. 

This brings me to Feb. 14, 1997.

thi s day wi lh her new boyfriend. Out

LOVE NET: 
Weaving a 'web' 
of frustration 
Continued from page 11 
lion, we made sure 10 e- mai l each 
olher all the boring details about 
the acli vilies 111 which we had 
engaged Ihroughout Ihe day. 

TIlcn we dC\:ided to lake Ihe big 
plunge; wc decided tu try talking on 
the lelephone. Strangely enough. we 
really got along and came to Ihe con-
clusion that we were somehow 
"meant to be together." 

The nexl Ihing you know Ihere 
wa~ a holiday weekend coming up. 
Convenienlly. "Lowercase" sug-

ge~ted travelling by plane to 'ee 
mc. [ musl have been insane at the 
time becau~e. I at:lually agreed 10 
such a plan and even found myse lf 
exc ited about it. 

TrUSI me when I tell you Ihal I 
am not menially incapacitated, or 
afllicted by any olher strange l1Ial-

adie~ . I guess you could say Ihal il 
sounded like a good idea al Ihe 
lil11e . You can relate 10 using Ihis 
sort or rationale to make sense of 
,oll1clhlng stupid Ihal you have 
done In the past. right'! 

The minute I set 1'001 in the air-
pori 10 pick him up. I knew that 
wi lh my luck somelhing was going 
to go wrong. However. I didn't 
antl ci pale Ihal everything was 
guing to go enlirely down Ihe drain. 

I greeted him wilh a hug as he 
clIllcd Ihe plane and. al thai 
moment. my fcars had becn more 
than sui id ly confirm ed. 

This guy was the biggest dork 
wil h whom I could have poss ibly 
w me inlo contact. Immediate ly, 
hundreds or queslions entered my 
poor lillie head. What was I goi ng 
to do with him all weekend. plus 
the Monday holiday" Was he goi ng 
to wan I to meel my friends'? I 
couldn't let that happen. I was 
about to make him buy a plane 

Finally, while we 
were separated for 
the time it took for 
"Lowercase" to use 
the restroom, I 
called my best 
friend and broke out 
Into a river of tears. 
When he was 
finished he came 
right into my room, 
despite the fact that 
the door was closed, 
and plopped down 
next to me like 
nothing was wrong. 

lickel back to wherever he had 
wme from, but Ihere was nowhcre 
left for mc to turn . 

I ended up spending Ihe whole 
weekend Irying to keep him as far 
away rrom mc as possible. Nalural -
Iy. he wanted to gel as close to me 
as he possibly he could. 

He did nOI voluntarily leave my 
side for more than a rew seconds the 
entire weekend. Finally. while we 
were separaled for the time it look 
ror "Lowercase" 10 use the reslroom. 
I called my be I friend and broke out 
into a river of tears. When he was 
finished he came right in to my 
room, de 'pite the fact that the door 
was closed, and plopped down nexi 
10 me like nothing was wrong. 

What the hell was this guy's

dinner. An eveni ng wilh friends 
sl:cm.:d likc a rather safe plan . so I 
agreed to venturI! otll into public 
with "Lowercase" and join my 
friends for dinner. 

The humiliation and irrilation, 
of course. carried over into Ihis 
evening as well. !;Ie rerused 10 talk 
to anyonl! else at the lab Ie. bUI he 
wasn't going to let lIIe down. He 
conlinued to whisper dumb COIl1-
ments into my car all night. 

Because we were in Southem 
Califomia, which happens to be Ihe 
ba e for many of Ihe bands Ihal we 
bolh liked, he came to Ihe conclu-
sion Ihal everyone and hi s Illolher 
was a rock star or in a band. 

Ralher Ihan keeping these 
assumplions 10 himself, he chose 
Ihese momenlS to speak up and let 
everyone else hear Ihem, including 
the person 10 whom he was rerer-
ring. I cou ld have died. When was 
Ihe nightmare going 10 end? 

Finally. Monday afternoon 
alTi ved, Ihe day th~1 "Lowercase" 
had 10 go back home. Yay for me. 
His departure was definilely going to 
be worthy of a celebration. I took 
him to Ih~ airport a few hou rs earl y. 
just to make sure Ihat there was no 
possibilily of him missing hi s nighl, 
and just dropped him ofT at the curb. 

I forced myself to give him a 
farewell hug and Ihen sent him on 
his way. As we departed. he told me 
how much fun he had over Ihe 
weekend. Then , in all eri u~n~ss. 
he asked ·'So. when are you coming 
10 visil me?" Was this guy for real? 
All I know i~ that he wa a very 
lucky kid because I was so emo-
lionally drained from hb weekend 
stay thai I had absoultely no 
respon e. ljust ignored him and gOI 
back in my car and drove away. 

I'm sure Ihal you can gather. 
from my experience. that love on 
on-line is a ridiculous concept. 

Take Ihe advice of someone 
who teamed the hard way - just 
don ' t do it !

INFLATED: 
Valentine's adds to 
student misery 
Continued from page 11 

PUlling together an evening to 
live Up to these expectations is 
almost as time-consuming as exe-
cuting the plan - not to mention 
the energy required in trying to 
come Up with something "ne-
ative." Everyone know th:ll Ihe 
stanllarll nower~-and-di nner IhlOg 
jusl doc~ not pa~~ muster 111 Icrlll~ 
of romantit: fal1 t a~ies . HOI :ur hal -

loon rides, candle-light dinners on 
the beach at sunset. complete with 
chilled champagne and chocolate-
covered slrawberries, moonlight 
strolls in the desen to stargaze -
these are the visions from which 
romantic fantasies are forged . And 
they take serious investments of 
time and labor to pull off. 

Other holidays have poor tim-
ing too. SI. Patrick's Day, which 
always seems to fall during finah 
week, is the most prominent 
example to come to mind . I 
haven ' l enjoyell a green becr on

these other holidays, the only .

poor liming is one's own. With SI. 
Valentine's Day, another person, a 
person supposedly very imponant 
to you, al 0 has a large take in the 
mailer. 

Somethi ng should be done 
about this timing issue . Perhaps the

plish something. 

The solution, I think, lies in the 
hands of the professors. All you 
ladies and gentlemen out there 
charged with educating us poor stu-
dents, I beg you, have a heart lIur-
ing the Valentine's week. Assign 
midterms either late during the

LOLITA HOTEL DE LOVE 
Kubrick's adaptation 

re-released with new scenes 
Lovers meet, quarrel in romantic comedy 

By Jami Lofgreen 
Staff W"ter 

Middle-aged Humbert Humbert 
'uccumb, to the seductions 01 
pubescent Lolita Hale in Stanley 
Kubrick 's re-rc leased. 
classic adaptation of 

abakov 's "Lolita" 
( 1':.162). 

James Mason play> 
the refined European 
professor who eagerly 
accepts room and board 
in the New Eng land 
household of widow 
Chariol\e Haze (Shell y Winters) 
after he catches a glimpse of her 
bikini-clad nymphet daughter, 
Lolita. Far from being the innocent 
ingenue, Lolita (Sue Lyon) is a 
manipUlative, gum-chewi ng ado-
lescent who stirs the passion, of the 
scholar and rustles the feat her, of 
her Ilirlatious mother. 

Shelly Winters is hi larious as 
the easi ly aroused Mrs. Hate, who 
doggedly pursues Ihe disinteresled 
Humbert by trapping him alone in 
the huusc, allempting to woo him 
ovcr candlelight dinner~ and pre-
tentious talk of European culture. 

She eventually accuses Lolita of 
interfering in their "counship." and 
sl) nd~ hl)r to summer camp -
much to Humbert 's chagrin. In 

order to be closer to the girl, he 
gives in 10 the mother '~ woomg and 
marries her. Fortunatl:ly for HUJll · 
bel1. she dies in a car aCCident soon 
after thc)' tic the knot. 

The second half 
of "Lolita" runs a lillie 
' Iower, as it follows the 
May-Dec. romance 
between the paternal 
Humbert and his nubile 
nymphet, which takes its 
course with Lolita at the 
he lm . The Haze home 
eventually becomes 

disheveled as Humbert's suspicion 
or the girl's extrac urri cular activi-
ties and mterest in boys' mounts . 

The talc takes increasingly 
incredulous plotlurns until the film 
comes full ci rcle with the con-
frontation belween Humben and 
hi s adversary Clare Quilty (Peter 
Se llers). the man who whisks hi s 
teenage love away from him. The 
quality of rerformances by Mason. 
Winters, Seller~ and Lyon more 
than compensate for the hokey plot 
line and 152-minute runnlllg t11ne. 

A minute of addilional dialogue 
deemed too sexually suggestive by 
the original (;ensors has been added 
for the IiIm's current release. One 
innuendo not to be missed:" amp 
Climax for Girls." 

By Jaml lofgreen 
Staff Writer 

The kitschy love-theme resurt 
"HOIel De Love" is Ihe fertile 
brceding ground and bailie ground 
for lovers in the new Australian 
romantic comedy of the same 
name by Craig Rosenberg. The 
film charts a weekend of antics 
among newlyweds and lonely 
hearts on the hotel grounds. 

First-time director Rosenberg 
scripted Ihe light-heartcd romantic 
comedy after a visit to a si milar 
hotel. The original screenplay was 
inspired by Ihe director 's experi-
ences at a honeymoon hote l in Nia-
gara Falls where he listened to the 
jaded manager describe the nuptials 
that had gone awry in hi s hotel. 

The ensemble piece takes a 
campy look at the love triangle 
between two Iwin brothers, Ri ck 
and Slephen Dunne, . and the 
object of thei r affections, Meli ssa 
Morri on. After losi ng contact 
with his high-school sweetheart 
Meli ssa, the cynical Rick, who 
works at the resort , I~ surprised to 
lind her registered as a guesl with 
her lianc': 10 years lalcr. The same 
weekend hI! is vis ited by hiS par-
ents - whose marriage ha~ 
always been a lillie ro(;ky - along 
with hi , lonely, qUirk brut her 

terhen. From there, the havoc 
en~ue~.

What Chekovian 
elements did you 
try to exploit in 
the script? 

Anne Kauffman: 
We haven 't dealt with 
the actress plaYing 
Charlolla as a Chckov· 
ian character. I've 

dealt with her t:umplctely as Deb 
W,lin 's character. 

I think that Deb has tlrawn a 
clear character. There is a lot going 
on with her. What I think makes it 
so pOignant is that in the midst of 
all of this, shc 's a very real person. 
Shc 's a child growi ng into woman-

adult world wants the you th to

What kind of collaboration

If people aJways did the right thing, we wouldn't have raCtsm . And the answer to racism isn't just tolerating 
each other. People don't want to be "jus tolerated ' -thev need to be loved. And just telling people to be more 
tolerant or loving hasn't worked and won c work We need a new heart attitude. a new ability to love-Jesus 
Christ specializes in heart transplants or' this ktnJ . He promises to give us the power to love even our enemies.

REDEMPTION: Without a hit through the first four innings, 
UCSD came back from behind for an 8-6 victory 
By Travis Hili 
Staff Writer 

All of you who arc addi cted to spans 
and, therefore , addicted to ESPN, probably 

watched the ESPY's ce remo· 
ni cs Monday night. 

Throughout the show, view-
ers were constantly reminded 
of the inspirational words of 
the late Jim Valvano: " Don ' t 
give up, don ' t ever give up ." 
Valano is bes t remembered for 
coaching North Carolina State 

to one of the greatest upsets in college 
basketball history, when the wolfpack de-

feated Ihe Georgetown Hoyas, led by Patrick 
Ewing, in the 1983 national championship. 

Given the UCSD baseball team ' s dra-
matic comeback victory over La Verne on 
Wednesday, Head Coal.:h Robert Fletcher' s 
Tritons must have been w3tl.:hing Keith, 
Dan and the ESPY's. 

Things were looking bleak in the top of 
the sixth . The crafty La Verne hurl er had 
kept the UCSD hillers off balance all game 
with an array of off-speed pitches . The 
Tritons had one allempt at a rally, pUlling 
runners on second and third , but they 
cou ldn't convert. They were down 4-0, and 
making costly mistakes in the field . 

Juniorstarter Mall 
Livingston was tir-
ing, and in the fi fth 
inning he a ll owed 
runne~ on seco nd 
and third. Wh en 
sop ho more John 
Willi s reli eved 
Livingston, it looked 
like he was just the 
latest guy given a turn 
on the merry -go -
round UCSD bullpen. 
Willi s, though , came 
in and very calmly 
got the bailer to hit 
into a ground ball to 
get out of the jam. 

Yakov Zolotorev/Guard;an 

Spike. up: Second baseman Kennith Fluharty turns a double play versus La Verne, 

great pitching by going down in order in the 
bottom of the inning. 

It is times like these when a team can get 
down and give up on the game, especially a 
team as young a the UCSD squad. But 
Fletcher and company refused to fold , and 
Willi s continued hi s dominance by shutting 
the Leopards down in Ihe top of the sixth 
inning. 

The bottom of the sixth was when every -
thing turned around. Ryan Hill led otT the 
inning by drawing a walk. Jon Goldsmith 
followed with an infield ingle, and fir t 
baseman Eric Pangelinan also had an in -
field hit. 

The bases were loaded for Mark Mason. 

head. The Tritons ended up tying the game 
with a big sixt h inning . 

From there, the Triton hillers continued 
to take advantage of Willi ' mastery of La 
Verne. They took the lead in the seventh 
inning and ended up bringing an 8-4 lead 
into the ninth. When Willi s finally began to 
tire in the ninth, the Leopards mounted a 
rally of their own. 

La Verne cu t the lead to 8c6 before 
Fletcher replaced Willis with fre hman 
Yoshayah Goldfarb. Goldfarb slammed the 
door on the Leopards, getting the final two 
outs. 

Airplane?: Jon Goldsmith (2) is tagged out by Leopard 
shortstop Brock WhObrey as Armando Hernandez looks on . 

The Tritons re -
sponded to Willis ' 

He didn't let the opportunity pass - he hit 
a long fl y ball to center field, good enough 
to send Hill home. Nick Wilson continued 
the rally with the biggest hit of the game -
a two-run double over the center fielder's 

It was a tremendous win for the Triton 
hardballers, who need victories like this to 
build up their confidence. Hopefully , the 
squad can use the momentum gathered from 
yesterday'S game to tally up the wins they 
seek in their upcoming two-game road trip 
at Biola and Concordia.

Standing at the three-point 
line, the man nervously l ook~ 
around at hiS surroundings. With 
a crowd or 20,000 ~creami ng 
fans cheering him on, time 
essentially stops for Jim Valente, 
a 49-year-old resort manager 
from We t Florida. He awaits 
the chance of a lifetime: sink a 
three-point hasket, walk away 
with $ I million. No strings 
attached, no defenders, and a 
hall-or-fame NBA player as a 
personal coach to boot.

UPSET CITY: The men's volleyball program etched its name in stone with the greatest upset in

By Steve Walsh 
Co·Assoclate Sports Editor 

Rematches have provided some 
of the most thrilling moment~ In 
sports history . Who can forget such 

dramatic moment~ as 
the duels between the 
U ni ted States and 
New Zea land in the 
America 's Cup,orthe 
Celtics and the L ak-
ers going back and 
forth for the NBA 

hampionship. 
ow the match between the vol -

leyball teams or U SO and USC 
can be added to the list. Last night, 
the Tnton~ were able to avenge an 
early SeaMlil loss to the Trojans and 
in the proce~s produce on the most 
thr i lIing and important victory in 
the hilltory of SD volleyball. For 
the first time In school hi story , 
UCSD defeated a NCAA DiVi sion I 
Top 10 team. 

With a grill y defense that dove 
after each ball and an aggressive 
offense that allacked the large USC 
block, the Tritons were able upset a 
10th-ranked Trojan squad that had 
beaten No. I tanford University 
j ust la t week. 

" This is definitely the biggest 
wi n ever for us," j unior captain Jon 
Yarrissaid . "At thebeginningofthe 
year, we filled out goal s heet~ of 
what we wanted to accompli sh thi. 
season and I put down that I wanted

to beat USc." 
In front of a boisterous RIMAC 

home crowd, UCSD showed its char-
acter as a squad by pushing the fa-
vored Trojans to fi ve games and 
then using i ts tremendous abi lity to 
sideout to WIO the match. 

The Tritons opened t he Ii rst game 
like a team posses~ed . scoring four 
unanswered point~ and knocking 
USC on its hee ls. After a USC time 
out, the Trojans rallied back to take 
the lead but the aggressive serving 
of UC D ensured that the come-
back wou ld not last long. A kill on 
an overpa 5 by j unior middle blocker 
Guy Mount and a solo block by 
senior Eric Mai put the Tritons up 
11 -8. Another block by Mai and an 
illegal -lift ca ll against USC gave 
UCSD its first game point. Follow-
ing a tough serve by Yarri s and an 
amazing diving save by senior set-
ter Satao Minami, Mai rose over the 
Trojan block to win the game for the 
Tritons. 

A s the teams switched sides, the 
home crowd showed their apprecia-
tion for the UCSD effort with a 
standing ovation. Starting the sec-
ond game, USC began to show why 
it had garnered a o. 10 ranking by 
jumping out to a 5- 1 lead. The height 
advantage of the Trojan frontline, 
anchored by 6- foot - 10 middle 
blocker Hungarian Szilard Kovacs,

But SO would not fold, and with

the pep talk U 0 scored a quick 
POlOt but was again foiled by the 
U block. The Tritons would get 
no closer as the Trojans took the 
game, 15-8. 

With the teams knotted at one 
game apiece, UCSD looked to avoid 
the inconsistency that had plagued 
the team in earlier matches. 

to put together a dramatic come-
back to win the third game. Just a in 
the prevIOus game. US tookaqUtck 
5- 1 lead and it appeared that the 
Triton ' bubble may have bur t. But 
senior Brian Hunnicutt had ome-
thing to say about that. Coming in 
off the bench, Hunnicutt provided 
the spark that UCSD needed by serv-
ing four con ecutive points to bring 
the Tritons back into the game. With 
the teams tied at 8-8, UCSD found 
itself lipping into another slump 

and gave up three quick points. 
McFarland again called time out to 
settle the team. Back on the courl. 
the Tritons responded in stellar fash-
ion . A service ace by Mai and a 
b lock hy the 5-foot-11 Minami 
~wung the momentum back on to the 
sl(le of the home team. Both teams 
traded points and found themselves 
tied at 14- 14, when Mall Minehan 
and Yarris came up wi th a clutch 
block for a point. W ith the crowd on 

it~ fee t, M ai took a se t from 
Hunnlcull and blasted it cross court 
to wi n the game. 

The fourth game was a near 
rep li cati on o f the second, wi th the 
Trojans again flexing the muscle 
of their frontline . As the UCSD 
defense dove for each ball fired at 
them, the USC attack refu sed to 
let up the pres ure. Trojan hitter
