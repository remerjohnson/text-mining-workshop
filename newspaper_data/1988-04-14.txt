Football fee referendum fails; 
Dimmesdale, Patterson in run-off

U.S. Presidential poll 
yields mixed results 
By CATHERINE SEIDEL 
St~ Wrlt~r 

The U.S. presidential prefer-
ence poll conducted as part of 
the AS election turned up a few 
surprises - among them the 
Rev. Jesse Jackson's ability to 
draw white votes here and the 
overwhelming allegiance to Demo-
cratic candidates on the campus. 

The main message, though, 
was one of confusion. No candi-
date is the "student candidate" if 
the straw poll is to be believed. 

Vice President George Bush 
received more votes, 722 (23.S%) 
than any other candidate. Jack-
son was next and first among 
Democrats with 698 votes 
(22.7%), then Governor Michael 
Dukakis (D-Mass.) with S91 
(19.2%). 

One-fifth o.f those voting were 

"undecided. " 
Jackson's 22.7% was accomp-

lished on a campus which is only 
about 3% Black. 

The total vote for Democratic 
candidates overwhelmed those 
for Republicans. 1,498 students 
voted for the various Democratic 
candidates and only 9S4 for Bush 
and the Republican stragglers. 

Born-again minister Pat 
Robertson received only 21 votes, 
0.6% of the total cast. 

Senator Albert Gore, one of 
only three active Democratic 
candidates, managed to pull only 
S9 votes, 1.9% of those cast. At 
that, he finished 17 votes behind 
Gary Hart. 

Republican Senator Robert 
Dole of Kansas, whose campaian 
collapsed last month, still man-
aged to aet 179 votes, far behind 
Bush but still aood enouah for 
fourth .mona all candidates.

For the second year in a row, 
efforts to establish a Division III 
football team have failed, and 
the i.sue may be tabled for some 
time. 

"It doesn't make sense to keep 
coming back to the students with 
the same issue," said Athletic 
Director Judy Sweet. 

Of 3,688 votes cast, 2,187, or 
S9.4 percent, were for the refer-
endum, and 40.6 were against. 
The referendum needed two-
thirds 'yes' votes to win. 

Last year, a similar football 
referendum didn't pass because 
not enough students voted. Last 
year's referendum called for a 
56.S0 increase. 

Sweet said she spoke for the 
whole athletic board: "We are 
obviously disappointed for the 
students that they didn't want it 
to pass, but we arepleaseclhat at 
least 60 percent of the students 
said that athletics were impor-
tant to UCSD." 

She also said that some of the 
positive things that it generated 
were discussion and such a strong 
voter turn-out, with students 
expressing themselves through 
the process of voting. 

Two other referenda, the "Co-
op Autonomy" and the "Co-op 
Management" referenda, received 
8S.4 and 8S.S percentages of yes 
votes respectively. 

Evan Weisenfeld, University 
Center Board (UCB) Commis-
sioner, said in response to the 
passing of the advisory referen-

An angry Johnny Patterson 
insisted he was the "best candi-
date" for A.S. President after he 
fell 18S votes short of a victory 
and was forced into a runoff with 
ajubilant Maynard Dimmesdale. 

"UCSD is changing faces ... 
that's why I have the opportunity 
to win this election," Dimmesdale 
said. "The reason I've appealed 
to students is that they have con-
fidence in my ability." 

The runoff will be held Wednes-
day, April 20th, between 9 am 
and S pm at the gym steps. 

Nearly one-third of the student 
body voted in this year's election, 
an unusually high turnout for an 
A.S. election. Patterson captured 
44.6 percent of the 3413 votes 
cast for president, and Dimmes-
dale got 32.3 percent of the 
electorate. 

Out ofa possible 12,7S2 voters, 
29.4 percent, or 3,7S9, cast bal-
lots. According to Randy Woo-
dard, Director of Student Govern-
ment, only four percent of 
SDSU's eligible students voted 
in that school's elections. 

A simple majority, or fifty 
percent-plus-one votes, is needed 
to win all A.S. races; in only 
three races is a run-off necessary. 
They include Revelle Junior 
Senator, A.S. Public Relations 
Commissioner, and President. 

The Team Unity slate. took 
nine out of the ten offices its 
members ran for (three of them 
unopposed) with only Patterson 
failina to win election. Out of the 
23 races contested, eight were 
uncontested. 

"I'm confident that I will keep 
working hard and I'm confident 
that Team Unity will come 
through for me," Patterson said. 

"In the run-off I'm going to 
talk to as many people as I can," 
Patterson added. "Look at my 
experience, [and] what I have 
done the past two years." 

Both Dimmesdale and Pattc:r-
son said they were willina to 
participate in a debate. "I'd wel-
come any sort of debate, anytime 
that anyone wants to set up 
[ one], 111 be there," Patterson 
said. Dimmesdale said he'd "love 
to debate Patterson." 

Asked why he thought he did 
so well, Dimmesdale talked about 
his "relationship with the admin-
istration and with the students ... 
I think they [students] can under-
stand that there's more oppor-
tunity to have their voice ex-
pressed, and they can get results 
from me." 

"I'm not going to compare 
myself to Patterson because we 
have two different philosophies 
of government. He's going after 
popular issues, which are not the 
focus of the problem," Dimmes-
dale said. "The focus of the prob-
lem is that there is no opposition 
to the administration, there's no 

or~anization of the students' 
voice. " 

He cited the football referen-
dum, the bike policy, the com-
munication stud'ent protest, and 
the alcohol policy, as issues which 
the student government failed to 
take a stand. 

"The administration is just not 
giving any reaard to the students' 
needs, .. Dimmesdale claimed.

An athletic department effort 
to organize turnout in the A.S. 
election by intercollegiate athlete 
backfired Tuesday, leaving 
Athletic Director Judy Sweet 
"shocked and disapponted ." 

Sweet met witb intercollegiate 
coaches last week to discuss ways 
of boosting the election turnout; 
last year, a football referendum 
got the required two-thirds vote 
but was not approved because of 
low turnout. 

collecting receipts around tbe 
polls and by 4 pm bad banned 
the entire collection. 

Sbe nevertheless received over 
600 receipts from at least 10 
coache by Tuesday night, she 
said. 

If the point was to encourage.. 
turnout, it worked - almost 
3,000 people, 900 over the mini-
mum necessary to validate the 
referendum, voted . 

The receipt system was thought 
by some to pressure athletes and 
their friends to participate in the 
election. 

Dimmesdale-Patterson run-off 
"In our discussions [in the 

department], we thought teams 
should be doing everything they 
can. A way of accounting for 
that is the receipt system," Sweet 
said Tuesday. 

"If we ever thought there would 
be pressure on the athletes, we 
never would bave advocated the 
[receipt collection]," Sweet said 
yesterday. "When we became 
aware, we asked tbat it be termi-
nated ." 

Continued from pace I 
Referring to Patterson's plat-
form, which includes a 24-hour 
convenience store and 24-hour 
study space, Dimmesdale said 
that "those are just sidelines,just 
the little peripberal things. That 
is why people are voting for me." 

"I pray that people don't ste-
reotype me as a fraternity 
member, "Patterson said. ")just 
want a fair shake. " I work very 
hard in the A.S. I just try to 
make sure that students know I 
want it [the presidency] more 
than anyone else." 

lonathan Judaken, aTe, .1 
Unity slate member elected Pro-
gramming Commissioncrfor next 
year, bemoaned the fact that 
"vast generalities WOIl out over a 

genuine person [Patterson] cap-
able of instituting programs that 
can make a difference." 

"I hope that it's not only the 
football issue that brought them 
[students] out [ to vote]. .. [I hope] 
it's people who ran, like myself, 
and it's the issues [of the cam-
paigns]," Judaken said. 

In other races, John Robison 
was elected Administrative Vice-
President. Robison picked up 
54.4 percent of the vote, com-
pared to George Reilly's 29.5 
percent, and "All Night Party" 
candidate Darrell Fetzer's 15.9 
percent.

tained his seat, defeating chal-

The Public Relations Com-
missioner's office is still up for 
grabs, witb Tom "T.R." Rbee 
winning 49 percent of the vote, 
27 votes short of tbe total needed 
for victory. He will face Rick 
Mersereau in the run-off. Merse-
reau got 29.8 percent of the vote. 

This year's Operations, Servi-
ces, and Enterprises Commis-
sioner, Patterson, will be replaced 
by Luis Ramirez, who defeated 
Bob De Carli 57 percent to 43 
percent. [Q) 

Sweet asked the coaches, who 
in turn talked to their players, to 
collect four or five ballot receipts 
from every intercollegiate athlete. 

Tuesday, athletes began to 
approach people at the polls 
asking for their receipts because, 
some athletes said, "[the] coach 
said we had to." 

The A.S. received at least one 
complaint, according to Director 
of Student Government Randy 
Woodard . He contacted Sweet 
but took no action. 

"It's something tbat should 
not be looked on as a violation .. . 
It's not illegal or against the 
election codes," Woodard said. 

Nevertheless, Sweet ordered a 
halt at 2 pm Tuesday to athletes 

"Our commitment har. been to 
get a strong voter turnout. That's 
why we came up with the whole 
receipt system .. . When we found 
out Tuesday that we could get a 
count on bow many people had 
voted by tbat night, we didn't 
need to do it anymore." Sweet 
said. 

Coaches almost unanimously 
pus bed the referendum in dis-
cussing the plan witb their 
athletes. 

"Our coacb was very sup-
portive of the referendum," said 
swimmer Steve Schatz. "Every-
one on our team is. We're all 
going to vote for it."

Hunter S. Thompson 
Jesse 

J esse Jackson was on TV in a whole different way last night -not on the .news, like always, but as the centerpiece of a very expensive-looking paid political ad, which the Jackson cam-
paign has not been able to afford up to now. Despite a stunning 
streak of victories and huge media coverage, Jesse has not attracted 
enough money in the way of campaign contributions to even pay for 
a full-time chartered plane, much less national TV ads. 

But the times they are at changin" as Dr. Bob once said, and the 
Rev. Jackson's formerly low-dollar presidential campaign has 
picked up more speed in the last six weeks than Gov. Dukakis' wife 
got her hands on in 26 years of what she says was a fearful addiction. 

But that is a different story and we will deal with it later, along with 
all the other loose ends - like horrible typos, for instance, that make 
my work a nightmare. Last week I referred to Jesse Jackson as a 
"speedy" black preacher .. . " but in print it was "greedy black 
preacher." 

And that is a huge difference - especially for ajournalist who has 
to deal with these candidates in person, as I did last weekend with 
Jesse. He was coming to Aspen on Saturday to make a speech at the 
Hotel Jerome - a "fund-raiser" in the trade - and it was clear that I 
had to attend, even though it was scheduled for the same time as the 
Oklahoma-Arizona game on TV. 

Here it was: The Final Four, and I was already down by two units 
on the gambling front and now Jesse was showing up at exactly the 
wrong time. I scanned the whole spectrum of avoidance behavior, 
but there was no way out. I had to make a choice. 

Or maybe not. .. I brought all my energies to bear on the problem, 
and at the last possible moment I came up with a solution. I called 
Bill Dixon up in Madison, Wisc., and he said Jesse was such a 
full-bore basketball fan that under no circumstances would he miss 
the biggest college game of the year. 

Dixon, formerly Gary Hart's national campaign manager, hadjust 
called a press conference in Green Bay to announce that he was 
endorsing Jackson for president. It was big on the network news, and 
Dixon was optimistic. "He is going to win in Wisconsin," he said. 
"And he is going to roll in Atlanta as the front-runner in both 
delegates and the popular vote. They are going to have a hell of a 
hard time d~nying him the nomination." 

Which is true. If Jesse wins Wisconsin, as Dixon predicts, he will go into the Atlanta convention with enough votes to force the Democratic Party to either destroy itself in a 
frenzy of racist haggling on prime-time TV or revitalize itself with a 
leap straight through the looking glass and into the 21st century by 
nominating a black man for president of the United States. 

That is a radical leap of faith that the party regulars are not ready 
for . They couldn't even handle George McGovern, a gentle one-time 
college professor from South Dakota who was once described by 
Bobby Kennedy as "the most decent man in the Senate." How are

Crabtree 
Hearing 
Editor: 

I am wrltmg in regard to 
"Crabtree Hearing Qosed," ( GUIlr-
dian, Apr. 7) the third paragraph 
of which states that the decision 
to maintain the hearing as a 
"closed" one was, " ... nominally 
made by Judicial Board Chair 
Eric (sic) Basil. However, it was 
Third Dean Luis Ramirez who 
actually made the choice." 

This is totally incorrect. The 
power to decide whether or not 
to open a disciplinary hearing to 
the public, in the event of dis-
agreement between the Univer-
sityand the accused, rests solely 
with the Judicial Board Chair, as 
stipulated by Student Conduct 
Code sec. 3S.IS.A.6. 

I made the formal decision to 
maintain the status of the April 6 
hearing as "closed" in tbe pre-
sence of both the accused and 
University officials . Both parties 
were consulted prior to my 
decision, which was made in-
dependently. The decision by the 
chair is final; had it been for an 
"open" hearing, the University 
would have been bound to 
comply. 

To further clarify: prior to my 
decision to keep the April 6 
hearing 'a "closed" one, I con-
sulted with both the accused and 
the University. At no time did 
either party possess, or attempt 
to exercise, the power to mandate 
my decision.

hunt last year. 
In 1987, the proposal to hunt 

lions drew widespread criticism. 
Over 85,000 Californians made 
their opposition to the needless 
slaughter known to the Com-
mission; more than had pre-
viously spoken out on any wild-
life issue. Despite this, tbe Com-
mission voted for a hunt. 111e 
slaughter was stopped by a 
Superior Court injunction ruling 
that the Commission had not 
considered the possible effects 
(such as extinction of regional 
populations) such as hunting 
could have. 

this year. Only they and 4000 
hunters can be pleased with this 
action. All who prefer lions alive 
rather than stuffed - and cert-
ainly the lions themselves -lose. 

The Commission needs to hear 
your views on this crucial matter .. 
They may be addressed to: Fish 
and Game Commission, 1416 
9th Street, Sacramento, CA. 
95814. The Commission must 
listen to the public, for all of us 
own the wildlife. The hunters do 
not have a monopoly. We won't 
stand for hunter-ruled partisan 
politics. We want mountain lions, 
not mounted lions. 

Cbril Waller 

-------------------------. Guardian stands by ilS story.) 
Lion hunting is a barbarity, 

not a sport. Only 4000 hunters 
bothered applying for last year's 
lion hunting tags - apparently 
even mos' hunters cannot sto-
mach the thought of running a 
beautiful animal up a tree with 
dogs and shooting it at point-
blank range. Biologists, the court , 
and even the Department of Fish 
and Game all agree that lion 
hunting would not stop attacks 
on humans, livestock, or wildlife. 
Nor does an overpopulation of 
lions exist. Lion hunting is simply 
killing for fun .

Thompson 
Continued from pile 4 
they ,oin, to deal with a gen-
uinely radical black preacher 
who has already run over most 
of the standard-brand political 
rules and shows no si,n of com-
promisin, with anybody this time 
around? 

Dixon, a former bankin, com-
missioner in Wisconsin and chair-
man of the Democratic Conven-
tion in 1980, seems to enjoy the 
prospects: 

Let me tell you a quick story: 
I'm in an elevator last week with 
Jease, Bill Monon, Tony (Anaya, 
former ,ovemor of New Mexico) 
and four Secret Service men ... 
Jesle ,eta in the elevator and 
says, "You know, Tony, I've been 
stumped for a few days. I read in 
the paper where the big boys of 
the Democratic Party are tryin, 
to take away the deleptes for 
me, even though I'm leading in 
·the popular vote. And I start to 
get mad and I say, They're doin, 
that 'cause I'm a black man .. . 
but then I think about it and 
realize, 'No! This is 1988 and I'm 
in America - this ain't a racist 
country. So why are they trying 
to take away my delegates?' 

"Then I start thinkin', man, I 
went to school for 16 years and 
got diplomas to prove it, and 
every year, I had to say 'One 
man, one vote,' in order to get 
my As and Bs. Well, the first 12 
years, it didn't mean black men, 
but then it did .. . And if they're 
trying to take a way my delegates, 
they're doing violence to my edu-
cation ... violence to my diplo-
ma. 

.. And I figured out, this is 1988 
in America, and those Demo-
cratic Party leaders, they ain't 
tryin, to do violence to edu-
cation, everybody's for educa-
tion. So, Tony, I'm trying to ' 
fi,ure out why they're tryin' to 
take away my deleptes. 

"Well, last night I'm layin' in 
bed, and it finally ,oddamn hits 
me: This 'one-man, one vote,' 
and they ain't gonna give me the 
deleptes for the nomination ... 
It's the goddamn metric system! 
They're playin' by the metric 
rules! And he starts shouting, 
'DOWN WITH THE METRIC 
SYSTEM! UP WITH JACK-
SON ACTION!' " 

A nd people are starting to turn tbeir headl, and they're wonderinl what 
the hen's ,oin, on ... and there's 
Jesse with his arm in tbe air, 
shoutinl ... and we're in a aJass 
elevator .. .. 

Well, thil ltarts at about the 
10th floor. We act to the I hh 
floor, and, of course, tbe Secret 
Service has ,ot all the elevatOR 
jammed, so there's like dozens of 
people on each hall. It's a aIals 
panel, so you can see everythina. 
And the elevator'.,oin, by with 
Jesse's voict at full volume, 
sereaminl this wild aibberilh. 
The people are roarin" and 
Secret Service ,uys, who never 
Iau,h, are cracking up. 

I asked him what the hell this 
"metric system" meant. 

"I don't know, man, I'm just 
telling you he's funny; he's got a 
sense of humor." 

But not me. There was nothing 
funny about missin, the Okla-
homa-Arizona game for a politi-
cal speech. I won by six points, 
and Jesse raised $15,000 from 
the all-white ski crowd. I sent 
word tbat I'd see him in Arizona. 

"That's the most dangerous 
place he'l have to go," Dixon 
said. "If they're goin, to kill him 
anywhere, they'l kill him there."

Referenda 
Continued from page I 
dum calling for a co-op man-
agement board separate from 
the future University Center, ". 
can't envision the UCB or the 
administration ever approving 
of it ." 

According to Paul Eyhmp, 
graduate student representative 

to the UCB, "We cannot operate 
one building without the otber 
because they serve more or less 
the same constituency." 

Weisenfeld said, "The Co-ops 
have it really good now," and 
that if they were to try to b.ve a 
separate management board , "it 
would be ineffective." 

Tamar Murachver, chair of 
the Co-op and Enterprises (Ccl:E) 
board said about tbe passing of 
both referenda , "I'm really 

pleased with tbe turnout because 
we [co-ops] bave been accused 
by the administration as just 
being special interest groups, but 
the votes are an indication that 
the students really do support 
co-ops." 

Weisenfeld doesn't see the Co-
ops as capable of being finan-
cially independent . "If they 
wanted to be autonomous, it 
would cost them too much 
money. The Chc's kitchen 

equipment is owned by the uni-
versity and so are some of the 
cash registers," he said . 

Murachver feels that some 
things will still have to be over-
seen by the board [UCB]. In 
reponse to being financially 
autonomous, she said , "It would 
have to be worked out if tbe 
equipment would have to be 
bought from the university." 

Chris Rys, the student who 
wrote the football referendum, 

T1tursthy, April U • .1988 7 

NEWS 
shared Sweet's view, "It showed 
that there was a strong voter 
turnout." 

However Rys felt that students 
didn' know the facts and nUlt 
voters were just generalizing tbe 
whole referendum to be for 
football. 

Sweet said , " What we were 
fighting against was a lot mis-
information. An unfortunate bias 
was developed by those individ-
uals who did not have the facts. 

Undergraduate

By KATHERINA PETERSON 
St~ Wrh~, 

H umanit ies Library 1205 just didn't look the same. Four robed men were 
chanting and playing instruments 
while seated on an oriental carpet 
spread across the floor . These 
men are Krsnas (Krishnas) and 
were hosting their weekly vege-
tarian d inner here at UCSD. 
They can also be seen around 
campus, passing out flyers , fudge 
a nd books on the philosophy of 
the Krsnas. 

The Krsna Consciousness Move-
ment t races its origins to 16th 
century Ind ia when Bengali spir-

itual leader Sri Caitanya founded 
the Krsna movement. Taking the 
perspective of a Protestant re-
ligion from the Hindu tradition, 
he developed a form of worship 
called kin&na, the chanting and 
singing of the holy names of the 
Lord. To the Knnas, Knna and 
Rama are Sanskrit names for 
God. (It is a custom for Krsnas 
to . take Sanskrit names.) Sri 
Caitanya, along with his follow 
ers, believe that by chanting the 
Hare Krsna mantra (transcen-
dental sound vibration), one can 
"develop love fo r God" and 
attain " self-realization." More-
over. by following Krsna's guide-
lines, a person can "become lib-
erated from one's material desires." 

The Krsnas believe in a body-
soul dichotomy whereby the 
body is material , a nd uni mpor-
tant, while the soul is spiritua l, 
and conversely, important. Ma ny 
Krsnas express this belief by 
wearing yellow markings on their 
bodies. The mark is made with 
tilak, clay from the sacred river 
Ganges. J ust as buildings have 
markings designating that they 
are temples. the Krsnas believe 
tha t the human body is a temple 
for t he soul and requires a mark-

ing. explained Krsna devotee 
Vendanta Sutra (Das). 

"When people gather to 
chant," said one Krsna devotee, 
"the spiritual bond is strenath-
ened ." When one chants, he feels 
himself "rising above the du-
alities (painl pleasure, heat I cold) 

which prevent us from being 
peaceful," aDd thereby from hap-
piness. Group meditation raises 
consciousness and counteracts 
the negative effecti of this pol-
luted world, according to the 
Krsnas . 

The Knna philosophy spread 
in the United States when Srila 

Prabhupada (spiritual master 
from India) came to the United 
States in 1965 to preach and 
establish the teachinas of Knna 
conscioUiness. Today, there are 
more than 100 spiritual centen, 
temples, rural communities , 
schools and institutes . 

See KRSNA, .. I. 9 

To the Krsnas, chanting and singing are an important aspect of Krsna worship. To them, group 
meditations, involving chanting, establish spiritual bonds bE.·tween members.

Krsna 
Continued from pale 8 

Contrary to what the general 
public perceives, not everyone in 
the Krsna movement shaves his 
head nor wears a traditional 
robe. Males shave their heads as 
a sign ofrenunciation . Moreover, 
men who wear dhotis (robes) 
and women who wear saris do so 
as participation in an ancient 
spiritual tradition. The men in 
the orange robes (the ones we see 
at UCSD or airports) are monks 
who are single and lead celibate 
lives . On the other hand, men in 
white robes are married . Al-
though celibacy is an ideal state, 
marriages are allowed . However, 
women and men are usuaUysepar-
ated. especially celibate men 
from women. The Knnas feel 
that the male's allaciation with

sermon and pray. Each devotee 
carries a cloth bag filled with a 
string of 108 wooden beads. For 
each bead they must say the 
mantra (the Hare Knna chant). 

In addition, there are the four 
regulated principles a devotee 
must follow in order to attain 
purification: no eating of meat, 
fish or eus; no intoxication, 
including coffee, tea or cigarettes; 
no gambling; and sex is only for 
the procreation of children. and 
this can be done only through 
marriage. 

To devotees, the Krsna move-
ment is not justa philosophy or a 
religion, but a way of life. One 
devotee doesn't recommend the 
Krsna movement for everyone , 
but for him. "satisfaction and 
happiness" are both found in the 
Krsna movement. lID

Nick Rothman had a tre-
mendous evening collecting 31 
kills for the game. New teammate 
Mike Badt, who has only been 
setting for two games, also had a 
great night compiling 8S assists . 
All of the starters, with the 
exception of the setter Badt, had 
more than 10 kills . Paul Miller 
had 18 followed by John Lim 
and Jeff Babcock with 17 each. 
Sean Hudson finished the eve-
ning with 13 kills . 

In the first game the Tritons 
only led for a brief period of time 
3-2 and then watched La Verne 
jump out to a IO-S lead and coast 
to an easy IS-8 opening game 
victory. In the second contest La 
Verne was winning 9-6 but UCSD 
overtook them 13-12 and 
squeaked out a close 15-13 
victory to even the score at one 
apiece. 

It looked as though La Verne 
would blowout the Tritons in 
the third game after leading 11-4. 
The Tritons again came back to 
tie the game at 12-12 before 
eventually falling IS-13. Down 
two games to one the Tritons 
were forced into a must win 
situation and they did just that 
winning the fourth game I S-12 
to even the score at two apiece. 
In the flfth and decidin~ game 
the Tritons seemed to put it all 
together and led 14-10 but La 
Verne wouldn't die easy. After 
five service points the Tritons 
finally scored the final point 
needed giving them the game IS-
10 and the match 3-2 @)

at USD but the results were not 
in by press time. The Tritons

In the one-and-a-half years 
since the Paul Dresher En-
semble's "new music" theater 
work, "Slow Fire," was pre-
sented in the San Diego area, 
the startling image of the cen-
tral character, Bob, still re-
mains embedded in the con-
sciousness of those who saw 
the two act show. A new ver-
sion of "Slow Fire" makes its 
San Diego premiere on Wed-
nesday, April 20 at the Man-
dell Weiss Center for the Per-
forming Arts .. 

The first 40-minute act of 
this "one-man show" remains 
the same as the original, while 
the second portion has been 
completely re-worked by the 
troupe. The members of the 
ensemble include Dresher 
(composer), Rinde Eckert 
(actor, singer, writer), Richard 
E .. T. White (director), Gene 

Th. Art. and Em.rtalnment Section

MAKES BURNING 
IMPRESSION 

trois as he plays his other 
instruments during a perfor-
mance. 

The tape processor allows 
for live multi-track recording, 

Reffkin (percussionist) and Jay 
Cloidt (sound designer, audio 
engineer) . 

Bob, as brought to life by 
actor / tenor Eckert, who also 
wrote the text, presents view-
ers with a story that makes 
compelling remarks on certain 
aspect of American life. This 
performance discusses the de-
teriorating mental and moral 
state of most Americans. 
"Slow Fire" shows the fetish 
we have for commodities, as 
well as our willful misreading 
of reality. 

Eckert's powerful perfor-

mance of a quirky, paranoid 
Bob tells of a man who is 
obsessed and haunted by the 
expectations of his father, a 
man who lived by maxims. 
Due to Eckert's stage presence, 
the myth of violence as a lib-
erating force and the material-
ism of the present period can-
not be ignored in "Slow Fire." 

In a recent review by the 
Village Voice, Eckert was des-
cribed as expressing "himself 
with the zeal of the born-again 
Christian and the blown wiring 
of the schizophrenic." With 

in mind, Eckert's rendi-
tion of Bob, the" consummate 
survivalist of the 'BOs," is 
incredulous as he employs 
singing and reciting, and util-
izes props to mesmerize the 
audience. 

The music - which is per-
formed by Dresher on guitar 
and keyboards, and by Ref-
flcin on drums - alongside 
Eckert on stage keeps "Slow Fire" 
movmg at an electrifying pace .. 
The unique sound in the piece 
is achieved through the use of 
a real-time tape processing 
system which Dresher con-

mixing processing and imme-
diate playback of the sounds 
produced on stage. With the 
tape-generated repetition, 
Dresher builds up unique 
orchestral textures, which also 
emphasize certain key points 
in Eckert 's narrative .. 

Dresher, who received an 
M .. A .. in Music from UCSD in 
1979, also is knowledgeable in 
non-western music such as 
Ghanaian drumming, Javanese 
and Balinese Gamelan, and 
North Indian classical music. 

"Slow Fire" will be per-
formed April 20, 21, 22 and 
23 at 8 pm and on April 24 at 
7 pm. Tickets are $15 for 
general admission and $6 for 
students .. Tickets are $12 for 
senior citizens, military, and 
UCSD faculty and staff on 
Wednesday and Thursday 
nights .. For more information,

Frank revisited 
by mark kenney 

hiatw writer 

At the close of Mary Shel, 
ley's classic, Frankenstein, the 
scientist's famous creature still 
wandered the face of the earth. 
Next Wednesday, April 30, 
he will be seen at the Mande-
ville Auditorium as a part of 
the Guthrie Theater's produc-
tion of "Frankenstein: Playing 
with Fire." 

The play, written by Bar-
bara Field. is based on the 
novel which has already 

spawned numerous plays and 
more than 20 film versions, 
from the Boris Karloff classic, 
"Frankenstein" to Mel 
Brooks' "Young Franken-
stein." However, the Field 
version attempts to avoid 
simply re-telling the oft-heard 
story by being a response to 
the novel instead of a new ver-
sion of it. 

In this play, the aging Dr. 
Frankenstein, who has pursued 
his long-tormented creature 
to the Arctic, shares the stage 
with the memories of his 

The family portraits are climbing out of their frames. 
There is Dad, with the world for a head, and Mom with a 
cornucojla face and a mirror over~e . omb. The kids, a 
girl ~~'I~"""'v~tvTS t . c~come to 
the n a ,a ~J'IMi~e t ,., Aollabora-
tion of Victor Chaynet and Andrew Clark, now showing 
at the Annex. 

The exhibit captures an aura of domestic surrealism; it 
is a stereotypical representation of the strangeness of life 
at home. The gallery space is restructured into a "typical" 
2.2 fa4wellin .. complete with aarigerator full of ma-caroni c ~e fir c'-'lazy-boy thron r :s&ox t Lftpfpower.

objects life. By analyzing the structure of the home and by 
questioning its relationship to the American Dream, we 
question ourselves. The show runs through Friday.

younger self and his creation, 
who re-live the events that 
have ruined both of them. 

Shelley originally wrote 
Frankenstein as a ghost story, 
which was meant to spark ter-
ror in the heart of the reader. 
However, in the 170 years 
since the novel first appeared, 
it has become much more than 
a simple tale of Gothic horror. 
Today, Frankenstein is consi-
dered, among other things, a 
story of birth, a science-fiction 
novel, and a tale of the dangers 
of experimenting with things 
that man was not meant to 
know. It is because of these 
many interpretations, or per-
haps partly because of Kar-
I off, that the novel has sur-
vived so long. 

The Guthrie Theatre was 
founded in Minneapolis in 
L963 with the intention of 
bringing professional theater 
to places outside of Broad-
way . Touring across the coun-
try, the Guthrie has visited 
almost every state and staged a 
wide variety of plays. Directed 
by Michael Maggio, and star-
ring Stephen Pelinski and Peter 
Syvertsen, the production will 
not be a simple re-working of 
an old tale. 

By placing the older, mis-
erable Victor Frankenstein and 
his creation on stage next to 
their younger selves, this play 
promises to be something 
more than a story of Gothic 
horror. Exactly how much 
more remains to be seen.

INTERNATIONAL STYLE FlLM SERIES 

Directed by Hector Oliver 
80 min. Argentina 1985 

... War begins as a picturesque comedy of provincial 
Argentinian .manners but quickly evolves into a harrowing 
anti-war satire. This film--which New York Times called 

"nddandy funny," is a canny essay on the ease with which 
self-righteously "good" people can tum murderously mean.
