is "enVironmentally safe, biodegradable, non-toxic, 
and prevents reignition," the flu id in the extinguisher 
has not been tested for its reliability in extinguishing

Kohn 's achievement. 

"AII of us at the ni versity o f

that the ohel Pri ze for Chemistry 
Iws gone to Professor Kohn_" 
Atkinson said. ''The methods that

later, they mistook him for a scarecrow. 

As news of the incident surfaced last week, the 
country recoiled in horror. College students around 
the nation reacted with shock and di smay, asking 
themselves if this could happen at their school. The 
problem is that very few know the answer to this 
question . 

California is one of only 21 states with laws 
against crimes based on sexual orientation. In con-
trast, 10 states - i neluding Wyoming - do not have 
any hate crime laws. Another 19 states do not include 
sexual orientation in their hate crime laws. 

The lime has come for federal hate crime legisla-
tion. We urge ongress to raslI the Federal Hate 
Crimes Protec tion Act, adding crimes based on gen-
der, di sability and sex ual rientation t Ihe list of fed-
eral crimes. 

Committee Will Ensure a 
Voice for UCSD Students 

Last Friday. hance llor Roben DYIll:s made it offi -
cial that the UCSD communit y would have a voice in 
who would be the AII - ampus Com men ement 
speaker. Dynes announced the members of a com-
mittee formed to help him choose the 1999 com-
mencement speaker. 

Dynes formed thi s commitl!.:e after accusations 
came from many people and groups acro~s campus 
that he did not get student and campus input on the 
decision to have U.S. Speaker of the House of 
Representatives Newt Gingrich address the 1998 
graduates . Now, with the committee that was 
announced last Friday, it appears that the 1999 com-
mencement speaker will , indeed, be UCSD's choice. 

The members of the commi ttee reflect a wide 
range of views on UCSD's campus . The A:S. presi -
dent and the GSA president will be pan of this group, 
as will Vice Chancellor James Langley, who wi ll 
chair the committee. Two provosts and two profes-
sors will also help to choose the commencement 
speaker, as well as a staff member and an alumni rep-
resentative. Most importantly, however, five students 
representing each of the five colleges will also be on 
this committee. 

By representing the voice of the people of UCSD, 
committee members will ensure that the selection of 
the commencement speaker will be a choice by the 
UC D community, and they will help to make com-
mencement tlUly an event for all of SD.

TEACH MEDICINE USING 
COMPASSION, NOT ANIMALS 

COMMENTARY: 
Despite new, cheaper 
technologies, UCSD's

Christine Dehlendorf 
Special to the Guardian 

Back in the bad old days. doctors 
commonly used bloodlell i ng leeches. 
fro ntal lobotomies, ~k ull -d r i lling and 
other gruesome techniques in the 
name of "good medit:ine." Fortunately, 
such barharil: practices have mostly 
gone the w .. y of the Spanish 
In4uisition. Yet, some of tmlay's med-
ical students still routinely and use-
lessly kill rabbits, cats, ferrets , pigs 
and - as at UCSD - dogs . 

Dcspite the ready availability of far 
more useful and much less costly ways 
to teach basic phy iology, pharmacol-
ogy and surgery, some 61 of the 123 
U.S. medical schools still strap down 
li ve animals, often friendly dogs, and 
perform senseless surgeries or inject 
vurious drugs to make the animals' 
hearts race or lhei r muscles contract. 
Then they kill them.

now ~hunncd by 62 U.S. medical

natives. 

Of course, medical students learn 
best by studying the only animalthcy 
will ever treat : humans. That 's why 
some of the finest U.S. medical 

live-animal teaching 
labs provide just 
crude demonstrations 
of concepts. These 
"show and tell" 
exercises not only 
cost animals their 
lives, but also 
medical schools lots 
of money.

At Harva rd Medical chool, ·tu -

scrubs, the students ~ec the entire 
surgery first hand, including pre-surgi-
cal line placement, venous cathcteriza-
tion, chest opening and vein harvest-
ing. They can also keep an eye on 
hemodynamic monitoring and the 
clTccts of cardiovascular drugs. The 
operations would happen anyway, so 

there's e, s.: nti ally no added cost for

Some medical ,chools, howeve r.

There is a myth thut student ~ need

The truth is tilat studcnb learn 
more about human physiology and

patients undergoing necessa ry surg-

animal. Textbooks and lectures pro-
vide additional learning, while so phis-

simulate biological systems, responses 
to various stimuli and a wide variety of 
case studies. 

It is also a myth that an animal lah 
provides medical students with valu-
able initial clinical experience and 
their "first patient" 

Animal labs don 't teach medica l 
procedures that students will use with 
human patients. They si mply demon-

PROPOSITIONS AFFECT UC 
COMMENTARY: 
Voting in Prop. 9 will 
reverse the positive 
effects Prop. 1 A will 
bring to public chools 
Joe Leventhal 
Special to the Guardian 

As students, we arc all too 
familiar wi th the prohlems of insuf-
licient classroom space and run 
down, out-of-date facilities. The 
need for repairs and renovations 
throughout the UC system impacts 
the quality of student life on cam-
pus. Many students arc forced to 
learn in inadequate biology, chem-
istry and engi neering lahs. 

On Nov. 3, California voters 
will be presentecl with two ballot 
measures that havc the potcntialto 
change the problem of inadequate 
and insul'ticient facilities . 

Proposition IA. a $9.2 billion 
school bond affecting kinder-
gartens through universit ies, pro-
vides desperately needed fund s to 
renovate and construct classrooms 
and laboratories. The funding from 
Proposition I A wi II also provide a 
safer learning environment for 
University of Ca lifornia students 
by bringing buildings into compli-
ance with current state earthquake 
standards. On the UCSD campus , 
funding from Proposition IA will 
provide the opportunity for a natur-
al science building to be built in 
Revelle l:OlIege. 

If California voters do not 
approve Pmposition lA, the situa-
tion will only worsen. The 
University of California is expect-
ing an enrollment surge of appmx-
imately half a million students by 
2005. with UCSD eventually see-
ing 27.000 of these students . If sig-
nificant resources arc not allocated 
to prepare for this dramatic growth. 
overcrowding and inadequate facil -
ities will continue to burden st u-
dents throughout the UC system. 

The second measure, 
Proposition 9, can possi hly reverse 
thc henefits of Propos ition IA. The 
state ofCalifornia's electrici ty mar-
ket is experiencing an ongoing 
transition to become more compet-
itive, giving consu mers an opportu-
nit y to choose their own power

Proposition 1A, a 
$9.2 billion school 
bond affecting 
kindergartens 
through 
universities, 
provides 
desperately needed 
funds to renovate 
and construct 
classrooms and 
laboratories. The 
funding from 
Proposition lA will 
also provide a safer 
learning 
environment for 
University of 
California students. 
providers based on their own 
needs. 

As with any change, regardless 
of its far-reaching importance, 
there are some who are determined 
to prevent it - even if it makes 
lhings worse for everyone else. 
These negati ve consequences arc 
precisely the problem with 
Proposition 9. 

This initiative would not only 
poison the emerging energy envi-
ronment, hut it would also deny 
individuals choice, lead to huge 
increascs in electric rates , diminish 
incentives for alternative energy 
usage and tri gger a massive eco-
nomic ri pple effect that wou ld 
reach the state's puhlic colleges 
and uni versities. That i~ why the 
Academic Senate for California 
Community Colleges. Ca lifornia 

Superintendent of Puhlic 
Instruction Dcl:line Eastin and 
Califomia Secrewry of Educlltion 
Marian Bergeson all oppose 
Proposition 9. 

Among other clTccts, 
Proposition 9 would force default 
on 6 billion in state-guaranteed 
bonds that were sold to provide 
immediate consumer rille cut s and 
a cap on mtes. Financial ex perts 
say the state would have tu make 
good on these bonds ri ght away. 
The only opti on for dealing with 
thi s problcm would be tux increas-
es, deep cuts in state-funded pro-
grams or some combination of the 
two. 

If the budget-cut option were 
exercised, higher education would 
suffer a devastating hlow, perhaps 
losing as much as $830 million, 
accordi ng to a new study by 
Metropolitan West Financial and 
Strategic Services. In all likeli-
hood, a cut this large would require 
significant increases in student fees 
and could dramati cally reduce 
access to higher education by many 
deserving students. 

Nearly 2,000 groups, organiza-
tions and individuals, including 
many that often oppose one ,moth-
er, have allied to defeat Proposition 
9. They range from the Planning 
and Conservation League, the 
Natural Resources Defcnse Council 
and the Environmental Defense 
Fund to thc California Chamber of 
Commerce, the California 
Taxpayers' Association and the 
Consumer Coalition of California. 
Two candidates for govemor, Dan 
Lungren and Gray Davis, both the 
Democratic and Republican parties, 
organized labor. business groups, 
city and county leaders, law 
enforcement and more than 100 
educational organizations and lead-
ers throughout the state also oppose 

· the initiative. 
As president of the Associated 

Students, I ~trong ly urge yo u to 
vote Yes on Proposition IA and No 
on Propositiun 9. Please take the 
time on Nov. 3 to cast these impor-
tant votes. The results of thi s elec-
ti on will have signili cant impacts 
on the education of current and 
future students.

VICTORS IN CALIFORNIA ELECTION PREDICTED 
COMMENTARY: 
On Nov. 3, Davis, 
Bustamante, Fang and 
Pringle will WIn 
By Teddy Dokko 
Staff Writer 

As Nov, 3 nears, we. as citi/cns 
of the United States and of 
California. arc called upon to do 
our solemn duty and act on our 
opinions, We are to go to Ihe polls, 
enter the lillie booths and pundl ht-
tic holes next to the names of the 
candidates and proposit ions we feel 
would best serve the interests of 
this nation and state. In other 
words, for thusc slow to catch on, 
vote! 

I'm not writing this to promote 
value of voting or to say that it 's the 
American thing to do. My purpose is 
not to lecture you lazy slobs about 
how millions have died to have a 
chance to vote, the ultimate expres-
sion of freedom, You all can watch 
Mel Gibson do this in "Bmveheart." 
Instead, J am here to give a brief 
breakdown of each of the major state 
elections coming up and my predic-
lions of who will be victorious, 

Even though this year dnesn't 
coincide with the presidential race, 
there arc still several major issues 
that face Californians this 
November. The most important to 
the average person. I believe. is the 
governorship of the state. Hmm ". I 
can almost hear the ecstatic cries of 
co llege students. homosexua ls. crim-
inals and illegal immigrants all 

around thi . state over the end of Pete 
Wilson 's n.:ign of terror. Rising out 
of the chaos to dai m the throne of 
the Golden State are republit'an State 
Allorney General Dan Lungren and 
democrat LI. Gov. Gray Davis. 

BOlh candidates have run rela-
tively clean campaigns. restraining 
from political mud-slinging, which 
has heen a popular strategy in past 
ciections. In the televised dehates. 
howe ver. the two go ~traight for the 
Jugular. slamming the opposing 
candidate with accusations of being 
too liberal and left wing or too con-
servative and right wing. The inter-
est ing poi nt in thi s electi on is that 
both candidatcs are I!rec ting a 

fa~ade of being moderates . 
By running as centrists. Lungren 

and Davis stand on very similar 
platforms with a rew, distinct ditler-
ences. Both claim to be tough on 
crime and criminals, and both have 
legitimate plans to assist K- 12 and 
higher education. Obviously, 
though, these two stances arc a sta-
ple to any campaign. The main dif-
ferences lie in more moral and ethi-
cal issues. mainly the debate over 
abortion and the death penalty. 
Davis has always been supportive or 
a woman's right to choose and is a 
firm defender of the death penalty. 
Lungren, on the other hand, has 
stood firml y against the death penal-
ty and has always been pro-life. 

These two difrerences. more than 
their views on crime and educati on 
(on which every candidate holds 
simi lar views). will he the deciding 
factors in this race for the governor 's 

Even though this year 
doesn't coincide with 
the IWesidentlal race, 
there are still several 
major issues that 
face Californians this 
election year. 
scat. Considering how Californians 
have voted in the past several guber-
natorial elections, things aren't 
about to change; former Gov. 
George Duekmejian and Gov. 
Wilson arc lierce advocalcs of the 
death penalty and Wilson is pro-
choice. a fact that has alienated him 
and those repuhlicans with similar 
views from their pal1y. Swing voters 
(read: liberal to moderate democ-
rats) will be the dilTercnce. Mark it 
down in the record books I:veryonc 
- you read it here lirst: Gray Davis 
will be California 's Ill!xt govemor. 

An ther impol1ant choice com-
ing up in Novemher is the ral:e ror 
the position or lieutenant governor 
- the person that takes over the 

govcmor's oflice in the case that he 
or she dies, rcsigns or becomcs inca-
pacitated. Though many people do 
not know. the role or the lieutenant 
govemor is morc than that of mere 
backup. Over the years. the impor-
tance of the lieutenant governor's 
role has Increased immensely 
hl:cause he now overlooks several 
state cOlllmissions. And. perhaps 
most important to u~ a~ collegc stu-
tkllls. the lieutenant govcrnor is. ex 
oflicio. regent of the University of 
California. This is the reason why 
we. as student s in the UC system, 
shou ld take particular interest in the 
race for the lieutenant governorship. 

Running ror this scat arc two 
fonner California legislators ousted 
by the unbeal,lhle term limit , demo-
crat Cruz Bustamante and republi-
can Tim Leslie, To hi credit, 
Bustamante was the first ever 
Latino speaker of the assembly, a 
position currently held by his good 
friend Antonio Villaraigosa. During 
hi s term as speaker, Bu ·tamante 
was ab Ie to accommodate both 
dcmocrats and repUblicans by 
pushing for bi lis to .:ut college 
tuition and to strengtllen laws 
against crimina ls using guns. 

Lesli e has also had a long polit-
ical carcer as both an assemhly-
member and state scnator. Perhaps 
hi s mos t important and significant 
contribution to the state is the three 
strikes law. a hi II he co-authored. 
This bill, however. is exactly where 
Leslie's fault lies - heyond the 
th ree strikes law, the average 

alifomian has not been greatl y 

exposed to Leslie 's name or his 
politics. What Leslie stands for and 
what direction he wants the state [() 
head in seems to he muddled and 
uncertain. In a recent round-table 
discussion. Leslie's answers and 
relorts seemed less than sharp, 
wh ile Buslamante's. in his low, 
hoomi ng voice. were to the point 
and meticulously thought out. My 
prcdi.:tion: Cruz Bustamante over 
Ti m Leslie by a wide margin , 

What docs this mean for 
California '! Quite a lot, actually. If 
what I predict cumes to pass, it 
means that for the !irst time since 
Jerry Brown's !irst term 24 years 
ago, aliforniu's executive branch 
will be under the control of democ-
rats . Coupling that with the fact 
that the California Legislature will 
probably be held hy the 
Dem cratie Party for another two 
years. California will be a liberal 
state heading into the next century. 
Great , the members of the Young 
Repuhlican club here on campus 
are getting ready to mob my apart-
ment and bum me at the stake now. 

A third important election to 
consider is the race for the United 
States Senate seat between 'incum-
bent Barbara Boxer and State 
Treasurer Mall Fong. This, as the 
polls have been showing, is a tight 
race. 10 the general public, Boxer 
has done lillie other than rag on ex-
Senator Bob Packwood and 
President Clinton for their " inap-
propriate" behavior. Even fewer 
people have hea rd of Matt Fong,

It is often justilied that the dog, 
used in labs will j u,t be killed any-

Many dogs, however, could he

It is also a myth that students 
enjoy dog labs. 

Of course, after many hours of 
tedious class room lectures, stu-
dent s welcome the excite ment of 
pUlling on scrubs and going into a 
lah. But , ob crving real human 
heart hypass surgery is far more 
appealing than witness ing a 
German shepherd or heagle need-
less ly killed. 

Medi cal schools that cont inue to

Grobstein, regarded by many as 
the father or modern developmental

Grobstein joined the UCSD fac -
ulty in 1965. He moved from 
Stanford Universit y where he was 
head or the hiology department. 
Grohstein held a variety of posi-
tions at UCSD, including dean of 
the med ica l school and vice chan-
ce llor for uni versi ty relati ons. 

"Cliff Grobstein was a tremen-

"H is interests reached far beyond

spurred thoughtful publi c discus-
sion ahout the pressing issues gen-
erated hy the scientific advances of 
our time, and contributed great wis-' 
dom and insight, no mailer how ' 
complex or controversial the topic 
might he." Dynes added. 

After se rving as chair or the 
UC D hiology department . 
Grobstein was named dean of the 
medical school in 1966. 

"The UCSD School or 
Medi cine was rortunate to have 
Clifford Gro bstein as its dean dur-
ing its early years." John Alksne. 
vice chance llor for health sciences 
and medil:al school dean, said . 

Grohstein rece ived an M.S. and 
Ph.D. in zoology from UCLA. As 
he did not have a medical degree, 
Grobstein was an unusual choice 
for dean and vice chancellor of the 
newly formed school of medicine. 

Paul Saltman. professor of hiol-
ogy, said that Grobstei n was instru-
mental in lay ing the foundation for 
the school's emergence as a pre-

"He was effective at 
presenting the 
university to the 
outside community. 
Cliff was

university an

"IGrohstein j did very well as an 
academic leader at a critica l time, 
the start-up time of the medica l 
school," Sa lt man said. 

Alksne said that Groostein was 
an elTccti vc leader for the ncw 
school of mcd icine. 

"He was we ll -suitcd to leading 

the recruitment efforts which suc-
cess rully attracted many eminent 
physicians and sc ienti sts from 
around the country to La Jolla. cre-
ating a medical schoollhat remains 
committed to excellence in bio-
medica l science as well as acade-
mi cs and clin ical medi cine," 
Alksne said . 

In 1973. Grohstein 's focus shift-
ed to linking the universi ty and the 
community as vice chance llor for 
uni versity relations. 

"He was elTecti ve at presenting 
th t: uni versity to the outside com-
munit y," Saltman said . "Cliff was 
di stingui shed, elegant and a very 
articul ate speaker, so he was in a 
way ahle to givc the uni ve rsit y an 
enhanced stature." 

Grobstein stepped down in 1977 
to concentrate on research as pro-
fessor of biologica l sc ience and 
public poli cy at UCSD. 

"Clifr was a very fine sc ienti st 
and highly recog ni zed for hi s 
accompl ishments," Sallman sai d. 
"He was a ve ry excellent communi-
cator of science and was very inter-
ested 111 aspects or bi oethics, and 
science and soc ial and p ublic po li -

Grobstcin , who was born in 

New York City, became professor 
emeritus of biological sc ience and 
public policy in 1987. 

He was elected to the National 
Institute or Medicine, the American 
Academy of Arts and Sciences. ana 
the National Academy of Science 
(NAS). Grohste in also served as 
chair of the NAS committee on 
diet, nutrition and cancer.

Disability Awareness 
SPEECH: Information 
session held on 
psychiatric disabilities 
By Sula Kim 
Staff Writer 

Aiming to educate the campus 
community on the most effective 
way to accommodate people with 
psychiatric disabilities in the 
workplace and to shed li ght on the 
legal implications or psychiatric 
disabilities. UCSD 's Employee 
Rehabili tation Program sponsored 
a workshop on psychiatril.: di~abi 1-
ities as part or Disabilities 
Awareness Week on Tuesday. 

The UCSD Employee 
Rehabi litati on Program spon-
sored the entire Di sabi lities 
Awareness Week in an effort to 
edul.:ate the public about discrim-
ination against peop le with dis-
abilities and their lifestyles. 

At the presentation, Barry 
Niman, the manager and rehabilita-
tion counselor or the Employee 
Rehabilitation Program at UCSD. 
said one way employers can 
accommodate workers with psychi-
atric disabi lities is by reamlllging 
their schedules so they I.:an work 
with frequent breaks, altemating 
shitis or longer lunch breaks. 

illlan also said tl1<1l physil.:'ll 
armngemenl~ can he matlc to provide 

a better workplace fOr people with 
disabilities. For example, he said 
employers can provide an enclosed 
private ollice. room dividers with 
sound proof walls that block noise 
and larger per.;()Ilal space. 

In July 1990, Congress passed 
the Americans with Disabilities 
Act that provides civil rights pro-
tections to individuals with dis-
abi lities simi lar to those provideu 
to individuals on the basis of race, 
color. sex, national origin . age and 
religion. The act guarantees equal 
opportunity for individuals with 
disabilities in public accommoua-
tions, employment, transportation, 
State and local government ser-
vil.:es, and telecommunications. 

Niman sa id he works to pro-
tect disabled facu lty and staff at 
UCSD. and helps them obtain 
justice in the work arena th rough 
viab le solutions. UCSD 
Employee Rehabilitation 
Program offers intervention, per-
sonal counseling. worker's com-
pensation and case management. 

Niman said he hopes to make a 
dilkrencc through groups like these 
and through awarenc.'.s presentations. 

"There hasn' t been cnough 
education," he said. "Pcople are 
afraid that they ' ll makc a mistake 
if they speak out ... thcy arc afraid 
or thcmse lves, and arraid of how 
others will reac!."

The Suicide Machines take punk 
back underground 

ust as punk is now 
marching out of the 
mainstream, so are Ihe 
ma instrcamcrs man.: h-
ing OUI of punk shows 
Ihroughout the country. 
This was the ca~c at Tlw 
Suicid ' Mac hines' pcr-
fonnancc on Saturday. 

Oct. 10, at SOMA as less enthusiastic fans 
left the show early. Punk is dead. hut thi s 
news has been well rece ived by the devoted 
ram, in the unuerground ~ccne. 

The Suicide Machines - made up of 
singer Jason Navarro, guitarist Dan Lukacin-
. ky. bass iM Royce unley and drummer Ryan 
Vandeherghe - formed 7 years ago in Detro it. 
Michigan. Although they go th rough more 
drummers than underwear. the 
newest drummer. Vundeberghc. 
performed ve ry well aftcr 
onl y o,ne week of band 
practice herore the tour. 

The band members 
ha ve matured over 

t he last seven years and so has t hei r music. 
The changes arc not onl y musical. hut lyri c'll 
as well. 

"We 've pre tty Illuch always bCl.!n ska-
punk." Lukacinsky , aid. " But it has taken us 
years to re line the sound ." 

"We' VI.! alway, been ki nd of politica l. hut 
now we 're reall y mature enough to ~; ;:y what 
we're feel in g," Lukaci nsky add 'd. 

"All in all. th is album is ju, t more us than 
anything wc 'vc cver done before:' unley said. 

The band is more political , and its convic-
tions morl.! fOl.:Useo than ever. 

Lukacinsky explains ahout their lat es t 
alhum, Ballle HY/II//.\· is not about violence, 
even though the title sounds stirring. It 's 
ahout stntgg le and fi ghting for your ri ght s. 
It \ ahout racism, the ri ght wing - evcn hat-

tling yourself." 

The new album is more representative or 
The Suicide Machines' live encrgy than their 
Hollywood Records dehut /)estl'llct;ol1 lJy Def-
i ll i tio//. 

"We rcally weren' t happy ahout the last 
record hecause we arc a lot harder li ve," un -
ley said . 

BailIe Hylllll .\' is a lot more hard-hilling. 
both musically and lyrically, than thc last 
album. While this may turn some fan ~ away, 
the band has not chan!;ed a, far as their live 
pcn'Ofl11anl:e is w ncerned. They have always 
had a har.~her sound than /Je.\·tl'llctioll By 
fJejillitillll portrayed. which is why five per-
formances arc so important. 

"It 's reall y beller to see a band live )irst. 
and then go out and buy the album. Live 
music is so important to what punk is." 
Lukacinsky said. 

With four opening bands, The Suicide 
Machines hosted an energy-packed line-up. 
They claimed their place in the harder-sound-
i ng punk scene with opening bands such as 
Swi ndle and AVAIL.

**** 

A featured DJ on Los Angeles ' 
Groove Radio I03. IFM. Sean 
Rubio has I:hosen songs from 13 
differenl arlists and made them hi s 
own. All of Ihese songs have been 
No. I ingles found on Ihe Hypnol-
ic label. (Hence, the name The 
HYfJnotic 12" Collection ) Rubio 
has added exotic sounds to these hit 
songs and Ihe resuh is a fairly greal 
CD. 

Wilh arliSIS ranging from 
Aqualile to Kraftweh and excellenl 
bealS varying from house 10 lrance, 
Hypl1mic is a CD listeners delinile-
Iy wanllO hear wilh Ihe bass IUrned 
up as far as il wi ll go. 

In addilion. listeners don ' I have 
10 worry ahout gelling into a song 
only to have il drop olT inlo dead 
silence. Like most great lechno 
CDs, all Ihe songs !low into eadl 
other. The Iransitions are smooth 
and melodic, begging you to dan<.:e, 
which is about Ihe onl y danger Ihis 
CD holds for a student Ihal aClUally 
wanls to study.

DJ Voodoo 
Voodoo Nation 

-
**** 

As a resident DJ at ew 
Orleans ' Palladium. DJ Voodoo 
was introduced to Liquid 
Melhod. The IwO DJs ultimately 
produced "Everybody Thinks I'm 
High, and I Am." The popularilY 
of th is si ngle and its B-s ide 
"S lam" led Voodoo to release two 
more singles on Swell and Phar-
macy Records. Voodoo Nation is 
DJ Voodoo 's first full -length 
effon , a fact helied by the matu-
rity and intensily found wilhin 
Ihe CD. 

A Slrong splash of house leads 
Ihe way inlo some phal. funky 
breaks thai invite the Ii slener 10 ri se 
up and dance. The pounding bass 
of high-energy tracks such as "A 
Voodoo Nalion" and "Dobrag" do 
nothing to prepare you for the 
smoothness of a trac k like the I:oi n-
cidentally named "Sun God." DJ 
Voodoo mixes unique sounds and 
mesmeri zi ng Iransitions as he spi ns 
a highly addiclive sel of enchanling 
tunes.

Oulkasl, Ihe eclectic duo from 

Atlanta, have just released AqLlelllilli, 
the name being a combinalion of 
their zodiac signs, Aquarius and 
Gemini . 

The album 's roll ing melodic 
slyle is complemented by the 
group 's brisk, inlricale rhyme and 

. olherworldl y lyrics. OUlkast's 
sound has evolved sli ghlly and Ihey 
have enli sled their off- the-hook 
Southern brelhren, Ihe Goodie 
Mob, on a few I:uls. Olher celebri lY 
appearances include the infamous 
Wu brolher Raekwon and the 
grandpappy of funk himself. 
George Clinlon. 

Polili ca l co nsciousness per-
vades Ihe album , as political 
ideas are interwove n wit h the 
ca tchy hooks o f aboul half the 
album 's exceptional Iracks. The 
rapping slyle is distinctly south -

which . like ci lanlro, is an

Mickey Hart , fonner drummer 

for Ihe Grateful Dead, allempled a 
projel:l earli er this decade wilh hi s 
release or Planer Om", . 

Wilh the success of Planet 
Onlm, Hart launched a new projcci 
titled Supralill/illa. or a "world 
heyond words." In Ihi s album , 
released in August , Easl meets 
West for a b auti ful blend of rhyth-
mic melodies. S/lpra/illR/la, which 
fealures world percussive sounds, 
w nsists of 12 creatively titled 
tracks that sel the mood for Ihe 
pieces before the lislener engages 
wilh the music. 

The album featu res over 18 di f-
ferent musicians, each one con-
tributing a different facet to Ihe 
w mpositions. The albu m blends 
harmonious percussive bealS wi lh 
pacify ing wi nd inslruments , which 
range from Ihe onh Indian labia 
and dholak 10 the Auslrali an did -

vocal piece Ihat weaves beautifully 
with the hackground melodies,

Also among Ihe better tracks, 
"Wheel of Timc" carries the mind, 
as Ihe great prophel Dave

Ihe Tabla and Engelhardl Bells in

Thi s CD is a musl for people

WHO'S YOUR DADDY? 
The Cherry Poppin ) Daddies swing into San Diego 
By Wendy Perez 
Guardian Reporter 

With the resurgence of popularity in swing 
music and culture, the Cherry Poppin ' Dad-
dies have managed to gain great success and 
recognition with their alhum Zoot Silit Riot. 

throughout the performance could he seen 
dancing and enj oyi ng themselves. The energy 
of these two individuals could be felt through 
their ent ire performance. Whil e the key-
boardi st was stiff. hi s voice was a nice addi -
tion to the island-ska sound . 

At thei r co ncert Friday 
night at OMA, the Cherry 
Poppin Daddies captured 
the essence of thai losl era. 

SOMA it se lf is very 
small , so dancing fu ll swi ng 
wasn't altoget her poss ible. 

//J co~cert = 
f<:"eVLeW 

The Hepcat style, howev-
er, seemed out of place 
among the other performers 
hecause or their predomi -
nanlly tropical-island sound. 
For their fa ns in attendance, 

This limitation may have been a blessing 
however, because many of the fans didn ' t 
seem to kn ow what a heat was or how to keep 
it. A phenomenon thought impossible bu t 
true. not one person could he found bohbing 
his head or snapping her lingers at the Slime 
time as anyone else. Otherwise , the concen 
WllS nearly !lawless. 

The Pietasters, the se<.:Ond band of the 
night, met the needs of the audience. Wilh a 
sound much like Ihe Mighty Mighty. 80s-
stones with a hint of Chicago, they were great. 
All of their songs dealt with women and rela-
ti onships. 

Listening to the Pietasters' ly rics closely, 
you could have sworn il was a cou nt ry song 
with jazz undertones. Their usc of trumpet, 
Lenor saxophone and tromhone, which were 
interspersed th mughout Ihe mu~ i c, made it 
impossihle to disl ike Ihem. Their music was 
powerful and in -your-face . 

A little l e~s ha~s and a so rter trumpet in 
~ome of Ihe slower songs coul d have 
improved their perfromance. The group could 
also stand to vary the genre of its lyrics. 
Overall howeve r, the Pietasters ' instrumenta-
tion and voca ls were 1I force to be reckoned 
with. 

The Hepca ts, ori ginally fro m Los Angeles 
and third 10 perform on Friday, are a band 
comprised of a keyhoardist, trumpeter, lenor 
sax ist, guitari st, bass ist, drummer and vocal-
ist. Their style was mellow, warm and happy. 
Much of their stage presence was created by 
the lead singer and trumpel playe r, who 

t hey put on a good show. 
The group even dedi cated a few song~ In 
some of the.audience members, as well as to 
Big 6. 

The stars of the night. the Cherry Poppin' 
Daddies, could not be outdone. Their live per-
formance was definit ely wo rth Ihe wait in 
line. The quality of the inslrumental sound 
combined wilh the ri ch vocal s of Steve Perry 
made for a stellar performance by the hand. 

"Zoot Suit Ri ot" was, of course, featured 
along with Illany of Ihe Cherry Poppin' Dad-
dies' new songs. Before he sang them, Steve 
Perry ex plained Ill any of hi s songs, ~uch 
"Drunk Daddy," which dea ls with alcoholi sm 
and child abuse. Perry jumped and danced all 
over the stage , and satislied the ragi ng hor-
mone ' of his femal e fo llowers with his gyrat-
ing pelvic moves. At va rious points th rough-
out the concert , the mi crophone could he 
found in Steve Perry's pant s, while he cont in-
ued with hi s Elvis- like: rouli ne. 

II was a fant astic show - the songs sounu 
better live. Whi Ie the acoustic design of 
SOMA isn't the greatest. it made no differ-
ence in the quality of the Cherry Poppin ' Dad-
dies' music. Most impressive was their instru -
mental line-up , which included aito, len or and 
baritone saxophones, a coronet, a trumpet and 
an upri ght bass that screams "Swingl" The 
pi ano and trumpet fea tures were smooth and 
the whole hand was alluned to the mood of 
the audience. 

The Cherry Poppin' Daddies succeeded in 
getting the crowd moving and creating an 
atmosphere of fun .

Punk band delivers 
message of unity 
Continued from page 11 

While the crowd gave the open-
ing baoJs a warm reception, the 
enthusi.lsm went through the roof 
when The Suicide Machine~ finally 
performed. The live performance 
did the music much more justice 
than any of the albums. The band 's 
energetic performance, a~ we ll as 
the sound itself, seemed to make 
the music more ali ve, as if that ever 

seemed possible. 
The music did sound harder and 

tbere was no happy skanking hap-
pening on-stage. But while the sound 
was harder and the clear singing of 
the CD was replaced with rough 
sounding screaming, the band 's mes-
sage was st ill very posi tive. 

The band deli vered messages of 
unity through their lyrics as we ll as 
Iheir aClions. Singer avarro did a

skanked and others just bobbed

cide Machines had something for 
everyone in a usually di vided scene. 

Navarro also broke down Ihe 
barrier between performer and 
audience, coming down from the 
stage more than once. offering the 
microphone 10 audience members 
so Ihallhey could si ng the song. 

Fans who mis~ed the perfor-

"San Di ego i, one of our

said. 
He also mentioned that it was 

Ihe ci ty they seemed to frequent the

While the performance on Oct. 
10 was a mainstage event , fans can 
probably look forward to more 
enjoyably, in timate sidestage shows. 

"Our original thing was just to 
be in a band and play music and we

CONTROVERSIAL FAIRY TALE 
Benigni's Life Is Beautiful' is more fable than fact 
By Christine Kerley 
Guardian Reporter 

La Vita E Bella (Life Is Beauti-
ful). the award winning Italian !ilm, 
thrusts the viewer into the exciting 
and capricious lifestyle of Guido, 
the film 's quirky protagonist played 
by director and co-writer Roberto 
Benigni . Sct in fascist Italy of 
1931.), Ihe award-winning film 
changes abruptly from a fairy- tale 
romance in Tuscany into a story of 
the struggle to preserve the human 
spirit in a German concentration 
camp. 

The firsl hal I' of the fi 1m is light-
heaned and enlertaining, showcas-
ing what Benigni is best known for 
- his comedic talent. The audi-
ence fa lls in love with Guido and 
cheers him on in his pursui t of the 
enchant ing " Princcsa:' Dora (Nico-
lelia Braschi). Their courtship is a 
sequence of chance meetings and 
hi larious mishaps that bespeak an 
ingeniously written, we ll t:horeo-
graphed st: ripl. Guido is fearless 
and good-humored in a way only 
an over-grown child t:an bc. and 
life rewards him (and the audient:e) 
with excitement and delight. 

No sooner does the SIOry jump 
;lht:ad a few years into the (;Duple's 
life (which now induLies their son 
Giosuc, played hy Giorgio Cantari -
ni), than it plat:c, al the fore the 
growing racism and fast: ism in Italy. 
The film only alluded to the~ i~sues 
very slighlly - and al limes hUll1or-
ous ly - earlier in the , Iory; hut now 
thcy take center stage a!> Guido and 
Gioslic arc rClllowd to a t:om:entra-
tion camp. 

Guido emharks upon a quest in 
which he muSI usc hi s vivid imagi-
nation as the vilal key to preserve 
hi s son's innocence and to ensure 

that Ihe experience does not ruin 
Giosue's appreciation for life. He 
altempts 10 shield Giosue from the 
reality of their situation by pretend-
ing it is all part of an elaboratc 

game. Gi ven the stark and realislic 
set of the camp, this seems almost 
impossible to do . 

The film is the culmination of 
two years of preproduction that 
invol ved tremendous research. 
Benigni 's intention was to create 
more of a fable than an historical 
documentary. However, ut of 
respect for the subject malter. 
he also strove for accura-
cy in the detai Is of the 
concentralion camps. 

The sudden shi ft 
111 the film 's 
focus also cap-
tures the sud-
den di s-

pla ~e-

,. 

ment felt hy some 8,000 Italian 
Jews who were removed from Iheir 
homes and deported to the l:amps. 
Bcnigni large ly adlieves aspecls 
both of a fable and of realism in Ihe 
film , which has won great acclaim. 
"Life is Beautiful" won the Grand 
Jury Pri ze at the 1998 Cannes Fi lm 
Festival and 8 David di Donatell o 
Awards (the Italian Oscars). 

Walching the lirst half of the 
film is an almost magica l cxperi -
ence. For all of its misadventures il 
may remain for some more credible 
than Guido's escapades in the con-
centration camp in Ihe laller hair. 
"Li fe [s Beautiful" challenges and 
invites the audience to panicipme 
in Guido's love for life.

ONE RIGHTIOUS BABE 
Ani Difranco rocks San Diego with her words 
By Marcia Scott 
Guardian Reporter 

On Monday. Oct. 12, a handful of wo men 
and a few righteous guys, (or perhaps ooys 
just trying to impress some chicks), went to 

press release. "Being a Ri ghteous Babe is not 
a matter of gender or age or hairstyle. It 's not 
just about twentysomething feminist se ll'-
expression:' 

One of Difranco's strong messages is that 
bed aware of the world's 
hypocrisies. They all 
dreamed of ways to 
change Inju sti ces that 
Monday night. thanks to 
Ani Difranco'~ perfor-

I/J co~cert = f, evtew 
we should see people as 
individuals. not as genders 
or as s tereo t ype~. Many peo-
ple have miscategorized Ani 
Difram:o as a man. hat ing 

mance at the DS U outdoor th eater. 
No. she is not a freckled -faced littl e girl 

with wrly. red hair and a dog named Sandy. 
Instead, her name is pronounced Aw-nee. Ani 
Difranco is a rocki n'. intelli gent. creative, 
honest, insightful. powerful. energctic, 
humorous, beautiful , intense, raw, talented. 
joyful and strong woman. 

Difranco grew up in BulTalo, N. Y. During. 
her childhood, Difranco 's parents often housed 
folk singers who pcrfonned in local clulls and 
bars. She was introduced to the intimate and 
socially aware folk world at an early age. She 
oegan playi ng gui tar at age nine, and it wa~ 
during her late tcen~. while ~he was studyi ng 
dance and vi~u a l arts. whcn ~he rea li/cd per-
framing music wa~ what she wanted to J ll. 

Difranco has been creating and performing 
punky-fo lk music for al least I U years now. 
However, her music is not heard on every 
radio stati on. nor arc her videos on the top· ten 
countdown. Inslead. she ha~ remained faithful 
to the indepenJent music scene. This choice is 
not oecause record companies arc not inter· 
ested in Difranco's music, as she has had 
many oilers . She is definit ely talent ed 
enough, or rather "marketable" enough, to 
join the main stream. But she hel ieves that it 
forces artists to focus on the bottom line 
instead of the art and politics in mu sic. 

In 1990. at the young age of 20. Difranco 
borrowed money from fri ends and fami ly to 
record her first album and start her own laoel. 
Ri ghteous Babe Records. In an effort to sup-
port local husinesses, she has kept her 
company in her hometown of Buffalo. 

Difranco says she wanted com-
plete control ova her music. pub-
licity, art and major career deci-
sions. 

She descrihed the vision 
behind Righteous Babe Rccords 
to ewsday. 

"I don ' t think the music 
industry i~ conducive to artistic 
and social change and growth . It 
docs a lot to exploi t and 
homogcnize al1 and artists. 
I n order to challenge the 
corporate mu~ic i ndus-
I ry, I feci i t ncce~sa ry 
to remain outside it 
... I could be se lling 
a lot more albums. 
Life could bl! a 
lot more cus hy. 
But it 's much 
more i ntcrest i ng 
to try to hammcr 
out an alternative 
route without the 
music industry and 
maybe cven be an 
example for other 
musicians. You 
don ' t ha ve to play 
ball ," Difranco said. 

Ri ghteous Babe 
has al ready produced 
the music of outside 
artists, providin g 
them with the 
opport uniti es 
and resou rce~ 
to record their 
music without 
sacrilicing their 

arti ~tic integrit ; . 

femi-nazi . Not true . In fact. 
~h.: has recently married her sound guru, 
Andrew Gilchris t (lovingly referred to as goat 
hoy). 

A rea ll y bcaul iful moment occurrcd during 
one of her not yet released songs. In it she 
uses thc lyrics. " My country 'tis of thee ," to 
expose many of the Uni ted States contradIC-
ti ons. During this song, a few lit candle, 
appeared throughout t he audience to mou I'll 
the death of Matthew Shepard, and to raise 
social awa reness about hi, horriole murder. 

For those who have never heard Ani 
Di franco before, check her oul. Her musIc can 
0' heard constantl y at the Food 0-01'. The 
magic and life that is Ani. however. can not be 
captured on a D. only live. The concerts are 
amazing because she isjust her~e l f - hone,t , 
intense. insightful , giggling and real. In fact, 
her mistakes and recoveries on stage arc an 
important pan of who she is'and what she rep-
rcsents. 

Do not feel threatened by her die-hard 
friends - most of thcm arc not man-hating 
monsters. Just understand that the crowd is 
there to dance, li sten to the music, hang on her 
every word and celeorat e this amazing 
woman and her "cute" talented oand. As for 
the ooys who label her music as "angry 
woman" music, and refuse to actually li sten, 
they are just jealous because so many women 
love and adore Ani Difranco.

Though the Tritons did 
not come home with any hard-
ware, their trip to L.A. was worth 
the drive. 

The UCSD contingem;y made 
a strong showing last weekend , 
with Tritons making it into the 
semifinals in the doubles bracket 
and making it through a few 
rounds on the singles side. 

However, more important than 
final results was what the Tritons 
could take home from their first 
matches of the year. 

"It was a good start to the sea-
son," Head Coach Eric Steidl mayer 
said. " It was a good learning expe-
riem:e. We got to sec what the top 
of the Division m competition will 
look like this year." 

At the top of Di vis ion III is 
UCSD senior Steve Shabel. 
Shabel , the Tritons ' top singles 
player, ended last season ranked 
10th in the nation in Division Ill. 
At the start of thi s season,

was in straight sets 6-0, 6-2. 

These two victories earned 
Shabel a spot in Sunday's quarterfi-
nals. Unfortunately, Sunday' play 
did not go as smoothl y for the 
senior. and Shabel lost to Derek 
Fi tzpatrick of UC Santa Cruz. 6-2, 
6-3. 

Though Shabel did not live up 
to his o. 3 national mnking, his 
performam;e this weekend was 
'upported by his teammates. 

"Steve [ShabelJ still played 
rea lly well. even though he does-
n' t get to prac tice that much," 
senior Ping Yeh said. "Most of us 
on the team are either pre-med or 
engineering students. Steve has to 
work rea lly hard on school this 
quarter and doesn' t have much 
room for practice. Considering he 
hasn't played much this fall, he 
played really well last weekend." 

There were also some other 
Tritons who had strong showings 
at las t weekend's tourn ament.

"Construction of Social Reality" ;:0 < IT! 

John R. Seale is one of the world 's teading phitosophers. He has made 
fundamentat contributions to all 01 its major fields. His specialties are Philosophy 
of Language, and the Phitosophy of the Mind. He will show how speech acts 
to create social institutions, such as banks and the.r products (e.g. money) 
and will argue that these institutions and their products are just as reat as the 
material constituents (bricks and paper) from which they are made. This work 
is thus a new and original defense of the reality of the externat wortd.

Steidlmayer speci fically noted the 
likes of Vincent Darmohusodo 
who "played well" in the tourna-
ment. 

"Vincent played solid; had a 
good tournamcnt." Steidl mayer 
said . "He should ha ve won the 
second set in his first match , but 
didn't. But hc played really we ll in 
the consolati on hracket." 

Steidl mayer also sa id that 
Darmohusodo's performance thi s 
past weekend should give him a 
lot more confidence go ing into 
this weekend's tournament at 
USD and throughout the rest of 
the season. 

Yeh sa id th at Darmohusocfo 
eame through last weekend. 

"Vim;ent played well ," Yeh 
said . " It was good to see him make 
it to the hack-draw finals ." 

Yeh also came in big for the 
Tritons at the Rolex tournament. 
He made it to the third round, hut 
fe ll to Fitzpatrick, the person who 
would beat Shabel in Sunday 's 
Quarterfinals, in straight games, 
6-0,6- 1. 

Though Yeh didn't make it in 
singles to day two, he found 
Saturday'S matches, particul arly 
hi s second round victory of 
Claremont College's Kri s Burrell, 
to be a grea t confidence hooster. 

"Kris and I have been hattling 
back and forth for years," Yell 
said. "After taki ng last year off, it 
felt really good to come back as an 
unseeded player and beat Burrell."

Yeh and Burrell swung hack 
and forth for three sets. Yell won 
the first set 6-2, got crushed 6-0 in 
the second , and ball led for a 6-3 
thi rd set victory for the overall 
match win . 

"It was so fun to play Burrell ," 
Yeh said. " It was on his homc (;Ourt 
and we each had players hacking 
us. The lhird set was a hattie." 

Steidlmaycr said that stronger 
camaraderie will perpetuate more 
wins. He encourages all the team 
members to cheer for their players 
regardles of whcther or not they 
had won their own match. 

"Our goal is to foster more 
team spirit," Steidlmayer said . 
"Cheering for one another hrings 
us together and that is what will 
wi n us matches thi s year." 

The Tritons wi ll put this philos-
ophy to test this weekend at the 
Division 1 USD tournament. 

Steidlmaycr ~aid that thi s 
upcoming tournament wi ll be an 
even greater learning experience 
than last weekend. 

"The kind of people we'll fac(~ 
thi s weekend will be of the same 
ca liber as the top men in Division 
III," Steidl mayer said. "They're 
going to hit a lot harder and play 
tougher. It will be a good test." 

Yeh said that he and hi s leam-
mates arc ready for the test. 

"We're not really afraid that 
we'll be facing Di vision r teams," 
Yeh said . "We will be there to 
compete. We' ll be there to win." 

The Tritons wi II open th is 
weekend's tournament play 
against Nebraska Wesleyan on 
Friday at 3 p.m. This game will not 
be an easy win for UCSD as the 

ehraska Wesleyan squad has 
proved to be a strong contender 
thus far into the season, boasting 
an 11 -2 record and a No. 14 
national ranking. 

Things will not get much easier 
for UCSD on aturday when they 

• face Di vision III newcomer, Cal 
State Hayward. UCSD and 
Hayward, previously Division II, 
have split thei r two matches thi s 
season; however, the Tritons pre-
vailed in their most recent 
matchup, winni ng in straig ht 
games. 

Unlike usual tournament play, 
where matches are decided by the 
best of three, this weekend's series 
of play will be full -fledged best-
of-five-game matchups. With so 
many matches in so lillie time, tHe 
Tritons ' deplh will be put to the 
lest. 

Come out tomorrow and 
Salurday and be dazzled by sea-
soned velerans and fledgling first 
years. The Tritons will play four 
games; two tomorrow and two on 
Saturday. On both Friday and 
Saturday the games arc at 3 p.m. 
and 7 p.m.

COACH: 
Baseball , swindling 
and Mr. Hill 
Continued frOIll pa,. 27 

Immedialely. one of our man-
agemenl science major roommates, 
a very cunning and eUllhroat lad, 
saw dollar signs. In fact . his eyes 
turned from blue 10 hright green. 
He whipped out a pen and paper 
and was on the move. We were 
se ll ing tickets Icfl and ri ghl. 

We were in hu~in ess. T he loud 
roommale wa~ screaming aboUi 
how greal our numhcrs were, I was 
doing PR work, jabberi ng wi th the 
peop le around us, assuring them 
th ai we were good, truslworth y 
fol k, whi le the two management 
sc ience majors bought and so ld at 
will , siock market sty le. 

Fimllly, our !i rst number was 
ca lled. We went up and hough t the 
ori ginal ti ckets for us, Ihen he 
bought the resl o f the tickets he 
could. Immediately, those ti ckets 
were scalped for a very nice pro lit. 

The business we formed was 
soon working like a well ·oi led 
machine. 

By the time out second number 
was called, we had a li st of people 
to huy tickels for, the surrounding 
communily was fully aware of the 
se rvices we were providing, and I 
held down the fort in the stands and 
had even wnvinced one of our cus-
lomers 10 go buy us In-N·Out 
Burgers and un e)( tra beer for me. 

Then we got greedy. We could 
do more. more, more! 

When our second number was 
ca lled, hoth of Ihe managemenl 
sciem:e majors went up, one wi th 
Ihe rea l numher and the olher pos-
ing as hi s " hrOlher." Somehow, the 
"sihling" was able to sneak into 
line and buy his full compliment of 
lickets. including the coup de 
grace: four $ 150 tield-Ievel ti ckets 
that some idiot had ju ~t returned. 

ow il was rea lly on. 
The hoys continued to whee l 

and deaL They were doing out-
sianding work. M y new job was to 
watch th e police and make sure we 
didn ' t get anyone arrested. II was 
hilarious, We weill from being nice 
to our cu, tomers to being co ld-
hearted businessmen. This one 
woman had made a Jeal with us to 
give us $40 to buy six tickets. Then 
another guy offered us 50 per 
ticket. Well, thai poor woman went 
from having the greatest fami ly 
outing ever to nothing as we gave 
her her money back and told her of 
the beller offer. She couldn' t match 
it with her low cash on hand, so she 
was screwed. 

Fi nally, we so ld all the tickets 
except for Ihe four lield-Ievel tick -
ets. Our greed had reached its 
zenith. We wanted $1 ,000 for all 
four. M y roommates approached 
Ihis very ri ch-look ing Italian guy 
w ith a lillie ,ideki ck. Draw your 
own concl usions aboul Ihis guy, 
Paisano. 

He asked how much. 
We said $250 per. 
He said nothing. 
The roommates kept wa lking. 
Then he wh iSlled them back. 

Thursday, OClober IS, 199 

He said 00. 
N ow il was deal time. 

. We said $900. 
He said meel him under Ihe C-I 

sign in the parking 101 in a minute. 
T hen he whips out thl! cell ular and 
says, " I'm buying ti ckets to da 
Series al da stadium . Get the cash 
here OW." With Ihis his lill l.: 
buddy chirped in, "And hurry up 
'bout it'" 

A t thl! meeling, he whipped oul 
a wad of hundreds the size of my 
fist. He pee led a scant nine olT the 
top and we were out. I love the 
M afia. 

Oh by the way, on the way out a 
couple of my roommates got inter-
viewed for Ihe Channel 8 news as 
well. 

We left the siadium at 12:30 
a.m. but it was well worth it. When 
we got home and eounled our win· 
nings: there was over $1 000 dollars 
in cash laying on the bed! The linal 
tally: our $40 tickets were paid for, 
and my three wheel ing and dealing 
roommates each made over $280. 
My cut for PR work was $180. Not 
too shabby. 

So, when the Padres won today, 
we were maybe the happiesl 
campers around. I mean, not only 
did we get our tickets to be part of 
hi story forever, bul we got Ihem 
paid for and we made a huge prof· 
it' You have got to be kidding me' 

Whal an amazing Irip.

come up w ith victory 
Continued 'rom page 28 
the 50th minul e. with UC D pressuring. a 
Coyote defender almo>t scored an own goal. 
Five m inules later, the Tritons amazingly had 
a header go off Ihe goalie 's hands, the cross-
bar and Ihe right POSI before popping back 
out. 

With such good chance " it seemed only a 
matter of time before the ball would lind it, 
way 111 . 

In Ihe 70lh minute, Dostalek ran down a 
ball from Harispe and I:rossed il just hefore it 
rolled over the endlinc:. The cross tipped all 
the keeper 's hands where it was fired into the 
net by Abizaid . II was a hustle play that typi-
tied the Triton effort all night long. The goal 
also helped soothe Ahiziad 's frustration from 
the ti rsl half. 

" We' re a good team ilnd we' re playing 
well right now." she said . "As long as we ' re 
patient , lthegoa lsl will come. That's j ust how 
it works out."

ushered to the ticket oftice, and so on. So 
basically, if 7.500 was drawn and you had 
7,499. you mighl as we ll go home and cry 
because you just got royally sc rewed. 

That was a sobering thought. considering 
that the people that were !irsl in line got Ihere 
at about 7 a.m . Coneeivah ly. Ihese people 
mi ght not even gel tickets. Thai was ~cary. 

There were four of us, though, and we fig-
ured we would have a good shot ill leasl one 
of us heing lucky. Then we got our numhers: 
Roommate #1 got 1,047; RoommalC #2 had 
3,632; Roommate #3 had 4.3 16: anJ Ihe 
Coach drew 9.564. We wou ld definit ely he 
OK, we thoughl , hecause we were prelly wc ll 
spaced OUI. We clamored inlo the ~ladium to 
awail Ihe drawing o f Ihe number. 

As we elllered, il was ohvinus the Padre 
front oflice had no idea of Ihe enormlly of Ih.: 
projeci they had undertaken. I 'd venlure to 
guess Ihallhe Padres lei in over 12,000 people. 

They sat us all in the hleachers facing Ihe 
lumboTron that was play ing Game 6 hetween 
Ihe Yankees and th l! Indians, and Ihen had 
one, thai 's right, 0 E guy in fronl try ing 10 
run the show. They opened three, Ihat 's righi , 
THRE E co ncess ion stands: one fully -
equipped. li ve-register stand. a nacho stand 
and a beer !>tand . I heard the line to huy a 
$5.25 20-ou nce Budweiser was over 2 
HO URS long' That 's how hadly Ihe Padres 
had prepared lor I his. 

Finall y al 7, four hours alh:r wc· arrived , 
Ihey drew Ihe firSI numher ... 

2 ,966. 
There was a collecti ve cry or victory and 

of e)(pieti ves from Ihe crowd . Most people 

lOW with the lead. the Tritons wl!re too 
e)(perienced to lei their guard down. They 
continued their relentless allacking sty le 
while the defense, anchored hy freshman 
Erik a Alfredson and juni or Liz Schilling. kept 
Ihe ball out of UCSD's half. 

CS 58 never reall y had any good scoring 
opportunities and. as Ihe dock ran oul , Ihe 
TrilOns had anOlher hard fought ielory. 

Head Coach Brian McManus said he was 
very impressed wil h how his leam slepped up 
and handled the physica l pres~ure . 

"h 's good to see our kids come hack and 
tackle." M cManus said . "That' s what we 
weren' t do ing in the beginning o f the year. 
We held them off and we weren't lelling our-
selves be inl imidaled like we did early in the 
year." 

After losing to CSU San Bernadino the 
last two years, McM anus knew this was a big 
win. nol onl y for contidence but also for play-
off position. 

"Every game now is a hig game." he sa id. 
" 0 one's goi ng to guarantee us anYlhing. If 
we lose three or four games in a row, other 
teams will gang up on us and we won ' l go to 
regionals." 

immediately got up to leave. I mean, imagine 
if you were holding 2.965 - you basically 
just took it in your rear end. 

Yel we did nol. We were in g real shape 
wil h numbers 3,632 and 4,316. Let me reiler-
ale Ihat: we were in outstanding shape wi lh 
our two numbers. 

Especial ly after the crowd rea li zed Ihat 
this wou ld take a lot longer than ex pected. 
The firS! group wenl and lOok aboul 40 min-
utes . At this rate everyone wi lh a number over 
ahOUI 5,000 had no hope at li cket ~. As the 
hoys and I were g leefu lly di scussing how 
many l ickets we werc go ing 10 huy for which 
game. we rea lized that we were not full y 
explori ng the options our si lUation prc.ented 
u,. 

Sec, each person could buy six ti cket, per 
game. The Padres would be hosting games 3, 
4 and 5. so each person could huy a total o f 
I X lickels. 

awol' course Ihere were vary ing li cket

surrounds life and his friends wilh the hug of an octopus. Once he 
has you, he's got you for good. And Ihen you're stuck. You're 
mesmerized by his charming wit . soulful eyes, and so much 
baloney that you 'll never need to hit the lunchmeat seclion at 

Vons again. This year Ahmad is committed to being the very first three·spon athtete in UCSD 
history (basketball , volleyball, and golf). Or Is it (tennis, waterpolo, and lacrosse)? Or was it

on the edge. Whether ilis rappeling the RIMAC exterior at 
midnight, or blocking 6-10 oulside hillers from UCLA during the 
menis volleyball season. Kurt is only at home when there is an 
impossible challenge to tackle. And thatis why Kurt is working the

Now kids. I wa nt to ~ha re 
wit h you the ~ to ry about exactl y 
how my roommates and I got 
our tickets. I swear to you, it 
was one of the wildest adven-

lure~ the Coach has heen on in 
awhile.

Tugger: Senior striker Alison Hurley yanks back and eventually topples a Coyote defender en route to another shutout victory last night. 

K, leI me se l the stage for 
y'a ll. It was Tue!'.day, and my 
three roommates and I (they 
must remain nameless, so leI \ 
just ca ll them "my roommate~") 
had planned to go to Ihe stadium 
to get ti<.:kets. We reall y had no 
idea how long it would take. or 
what the circumstances would

So. after duti full y allending 
all of our classes and taking 
another round of splendid notes. 
we got in the car and drove to 
the Murph (I still refu se to call it 
Qualcomm or even worse, the 
very lame "Q"). By the time we 
got there at around 3:30, the line 
was at least 2,500 people long. 
But we figured it was cool, we' d 
get tickets. So we got in line. 

Then some official -Iypes 
started walking around amI 
telling us what was going on. 

Hl:re was the deal : they were 
goi ng to let eve ryone in line into 
the stadium, and as you entered. 
you would be given a wristband 
with a number ranging from 
1.000- 11 .000. Then. once allthl! 
wristbands had heen given out . 
they would draw a number at 
random from the hat. The ticket 
sa les would start with the per-
son with Ihat number. and go 
'equentially fro m there in 
groups of 200 that would he

recent memory. 

"Thi ~ weekend is a big weekend 

for us," Head oac h Duncan

tournament, U D held on to beat 

entral in five games in the semifi-
nals and then staged a heroic come-
from-behind victory over Juniata to

currently ranked second in the 
nation, had previously upset
