Stripper 
Appears At 
On-Campus 
Rush Event 
By RANDY DOTINGA 
Staff Writer 

In a move that disturbed the 
UCSD administration, an esti-
mated 200 males watched a 
woman strip down to her G-string 
in Peterson Hall Friday night, 
during a rush week event spon-
ored by the Sigma Alpha Mu 

fraternity. 
The incident has prompted Vice 

Chancellor of Undergraduate Af-
fairs Joe Watson to request a 
review of the administrative proce-
dures that allowed the event to 
take place on campus. 

After learning of the event, 
Watson said, ··1 will ask that our 
procedures be reviewed and also 
our pQlicy or criteria [be reviewed] 
regarding the types of events that 
should be permittt;d on campus." 

Watson added that he would 
ask Assistant Vice Chancellor 
Tom Tucker to initiate the re-
view, which Watson felt should 
include student input. 

"It's clear that ... we have our 
doubts and serious concerns about 
whether [such events are] ap-
propriate for the campus," Wat-
on concluded. 

According to Tom Allen, who 
is in charge of scheduling room 
reservations for the Registrar,

An estimated $8,000 
worth of computer equipment 
and furniture was stolen from 
the University Events Office 
(U EO) in the Student Center 
over the weekend. 

The equipment was boxed 
up, as it was in the process of 
being moved from the Stu-
dent Center to the Price 
Center. 

··The theft occured, prob-
ably on Sunday," said UEO 
Director Lynne Peterson. "It 
was not discovered until 
Monday morning." 

According to Peterson, 
everything was secure when 
the last person left the office 
on Saturday, and only she 
and associate Ruth Baily have 
keys to the office. 

However, UCSD Police 
Detective Tracy Mclarney 
said that there was no forced

A.S. Candidates Give

By SETH SLATER 

ews Editor 

Roughly half of this year's 
ASUCSD candidates gathered 
Monday afternoon on the steps of 
Revelle Plaza to deliver brief 
campaign addre ses. 

The peeches, given in rapid , 
turnstile uccession, were part of 
the candidate ' efforts to rally 
su pport on the la t day before the 
opening of the three day voting 
period, which will draw to a close 
today at 2 p.m. 

F or the most part, candidates 
tuck to common campaign 

themes and spoke on the need for 
student unity and the lack of 
administrative responsiveness to 
student needs. 

However, J . Anthony Waldi-
chuk, the All Night Party Slate's 
candidate for A.S. president, 
strayed from traditional themes 
in his speech, the first of the 
afternoon.

He pledged to "Maybe help the

work to place beer vendors and 
cocktail waitresses in all major 
lecture halls on campus. 

when an organization wants to 
reserve a campus room, they must 
first channel their request through 
EDNA, which verifies whether 
the group is a legitimate campus 
organization. 

rules concerning room rentals by 
campus groups are that they must 
be registered student organiza-
tions, and that "they're not sup-
posed to eat or drink in the 
rooms." 

Waldichuk concluded his 
remarks by inviting listeners to 
"Join me in the Pub for election 
results, because win or lose, we 
booze. " Then, "EDNA calls me and 

reserves the room .... I don't ask 
what they use it for," Allen said, 
adding that "The Sammies [Sigma

the A.S . presidency, opened his 
speech with a quotation from

Non-Student Arrested on Campus 
Citizens' Arrest Leads to Marijuana Bust at Galbraith Hall 

By A.M. BEZZERIDES 
Training Director 

A citizens' arrest made by library ~ecurity for 
attempted theft led to a subsequent police arrest for 
possession of marijuana Monday night at Galbraith 
Hall. 

Farzin Omidvar, 26, was initially detained by 
library security guard Charlotte Klebe for allegedly 
attempting to steal a philosophy book. 

According to Klebe, after setting off the alarm at 
the circulation desk exit three times, Omidvar 
requested that he be allowed to speak in private to a 
library official. 

In a back office, Omidvar then revealed a book, 
The Metaphysics of Descartes. under his shirt, to a 
library official who wished to remain anonymous. 

According to this official, Omidvar claimed to be 
a student, but she did not find him on the Registrar's 
microfiche list. He also told her the book was for 
Philosophy 110, a class which is not offered this 

quarter. 
The police were called when the situation appeared 

to be a security issue. 
··We suspected something when [Omidvar] had 

no identification. He was nervous and everything he 
said didn't add up, so then we called the police," she 
said. 

Omidvar was arrested by police who acted as the 
agent for the citizens' arrest. 

During a routine pat down, Omidvar was allegedly 
found to be in possession of a small amount of 
marijuana, Officer Freddy Pesquira said. 

Omidvar was then taken to the campus police 
station where he was cited and released, according to 
a police report. 

The case will now be turned over to the city 
attorney's office where Omidvar will probably 
receive a fine and probation for petty theft of a 
$ 15.00 book and possession of less than one ounce 
of marijuana , said UC Records Supervisor Dennis 
Ke singer. 

Omidvar could not be reached for comment. 

tor, then launched into what he 
perceives as the problems facing 
UCSD which call for uch action. 

"I say, when you look at stu-
dent rights and you ee your 
campus-based fees constantly in-
creasing and your tate-wide edu-
cation and registration fees con-
tantly increasing," Ramirez aid, 

his voice booming acros the 
plaza , "you know that this is the 
time for vigorous and po itive 
action. 

"When you see that you don't 
have direct acces to the executive 
council and, particularly, the presi-
dent ... and when you see that the 

. student voice is not a strong stu-
dent voice, one that can't addres 
these student rights issues and

Two Measles 
Cases Found 
AtUCSD 

After diagnosing two cases of 
measles on campus earlier this 
week, the Student Health Service 
is urging students to seek immun-
ization against what they consider 
"a potentially very serious illness," 
which "could easily force a stu-
dent to drop an academic quar-
ter ... 

According to John Giebink, 
director of the Student Health 
Center, measles spreads rapidly -
especially through densely popu-
lated areas such as college cam-
pu e . 

"If [students] think they have 
been exposed , they should be 
vaccinated because it really cuts 
down [on their chances of con-
tracting the disease]," Giebink 
said. 

Complications of measles may 
include "pneumonia, brain infla-
mation and sometime death des-
pite treatment ," according to the 
Health Service. 

To prevent such complications, 
the Service's flyer suggests that 
those born in 1957 or after who 
were not vaccinated against 
measles after 1980, be immunized 
free of charge at the Health Cen-
ter betwen 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. 
Monday through Friday. 

The most common side effect 
from the vaccination, according 
to Giebink, include "Maybe a lit-
tle swelling at the site of the 
injection and, possibly, a little bit 
of pain associated with that." 

Side effects could also include a 
low grade fever and joint pain 
which lasts for "a day or two," 
Giebink said. 

The Center immunized 188 
people on Tuesday night and 
another 250as of noon yesterday.

I~ UC NEWS 
Former U CSB Chancellor Restricted 
from Research Travels Abroad 

SANTA BARBARA - Former UCSB Chancellor 
Robert HUHenback' plan to travel to Pakistan to 
conduct historical research were dashed by Santa 
Barbara County Judge Zel Canter's decision two 
weeks ago that the trip would violate the conditions 
of Huttenback's parole. 

"I consider the request inappropriate, ~ Canter 
wrote in a March 24 statement . " I believe in this case 
the terms of probation should not include interna-
tional travel. Thi defendant has forfeited his privilege 
to leave the country during the term of his 
probation. " 

Huttenback is currently appealing his July 1988 
convictions of embezzling more than $250,000 from 
the University and five counts of failure to report tax-
able income. His wife Freda was also found guilty on 
a single embezzlement charge. 

Dr. Huttenback, who is currently suspended from 
teaching at UCSB but is still collecting a $6,750 
monthly salary as a history profes or, had planned to 
go to Pakistan to conduct historical research for a 
book he is writing with UC Berkeley Professor Leo E. 
Rose. The research was to be part of a "longstanding 
project~ begun prior to Huttenback's trial, according 
to Dennis Fischer, HUHenback's attorney. Fischer 
said he does not believe Huttenback will be able to 
complete the research without the Pakistan trip.

An 'Insider' Theft of Computers at UC 
Irvine Brings Losses to 5125,000 

IRVI E - The Social Science Tower at UCI wa 
burglarized over spring break for the fifth time in a 
to-month period , bringing the 10 s of computer and 
office equipment to over $125,000. according to UC I 
police. 

" All indications ay it's an inside job, no doubt 
about that," UCI Police Lt. Bill Miller said. "There's 
no sign of fo rced entry; they have keys. It 's someone 
who is a Uel per onnel." 

Burglars broke into the Social Science Tower and 
stole office equipment and computers, worth $32,500, 
between the evening of March 24 and _the morning of 
March 28, Miller said . 

After the last theft in the building in February, 

BLOOM COUNTY 

social science administators said they had taken mea-
sures to ensure the building's safety. 

Management Services Officer Kathy Girvin, in an 
earlier interview, said the school had hired more 
community service officers to patrol the building dur-
ing weekend nights when most of the thefts over the 
past ten months had occurred. A CSO who patrols 
the tower, however, said only one officer patrols the 
entire building at a time.

U C Riverside Chancellor Approves Plan 
to Increase Enrollment to 15,050 

RIVERSIDE - UCR Chancellor Rosemary S. J. 
Schraer confirmed in a letter to faculty and staff that 
the campus will grow to 15,050 students by 2005. The 
latest growth projection for UCR is the lowest of 
three growth scenarios presented to UC President 
David P. Gardner last spring. However, selection of 
this more conservative figure has provoked critici m 
among many of UCR's faculty members. 

"The figure of 15,050 students in 2005~6 is not a 
'cap ' on the Riverside campus," Schraer said. "It 
represents the optimal estimated planned capit~ity of 
the campus." 

Schraer said the campus growth policy will be peri-
odically reviewed. If the campus enrollment demand 
and capacity demonstrate UCR's ability to accommo-
date more students, the Chancellor will work with 
Gardner to add another 3,000 students beyond the 
present 15,050 by 2005. 

According to the report, the more conservative 
enrollment figure was chosen after analysis of several 
factors , including academic goals, appropriate gradu-
ate / undergraduate / health sciences student enrol-
lment mix, campus characteristics, physical resources, 
and environmental factors .

Chilean Novelist to Deliver Robert C. 
Elliot Memorial Lecture 

Chilean novelist Isabel Allende, acclaimed author 
of Eva Luna, and two other novels, will deliver the 
eighth annual Robert C. Elliott Memorial Lecture at 
UCSD on April 13 at 8 p.m. in Third College Lecture 
Hall. 

Her talk, "The Voice of a Latin American Writer," 
is free and open to the public. 

Allende, whose father was a distant cousin of 
former Chilean President Salvador Allende, currently 
lives in Marin County in Northern California. 

A former journalist, Allende left Chile for Venezu-
ela 15 months after a 1973 military coup toppled the 
democratically-elected Allende goverment and 
ushered in the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. 

"Isabel Allende is today one of the most famous 
women writers of Chile," said Jaime Concha, profes-
sor of Spanish literature at UCSD. 

"Her three novels, The House of (he Spirits (1982), 
Of Love and Shadows (1987), and Eva Luna (1988), 
have earned her a special place in the distinguished 
company of contemporary Latin American novelists," 
Concha said . "Writing in exile from her native Chile, 
she imaginatively recreates her culture and history, 
from a woman's standpoint," Concha said. 

The Elliott Memorial Lecture is presented annually 
be the department of literature to honor Professor 
Robert C. Elliot, one of the founders of the depart-
ment, who died in 1981.

speak on "Affirmative Action: Into the '9Os," on April 
14 at 8 p.m., in the Price Center Ballroom on the 
UCSD campus. . 

Retired from the U.S. House of Representatives 
since 1982, Chisholm has since made a career of lec-
turing and teaching at educational institutions. 

During her political career in Washington D.C., 
Chisholm was credited for her efforts on behalf of 
black education, compensatory education, minimum 
wage for domestics, and the plights of migrant farm-
workers, American Indians and Haitian refugees. 

Chisholm was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 
1924, the daughter of Barbadian parents. She received 
a Bachelor of Arts degree, with honors, from Brook-
lyn College, and later a Master of Arts degree with a 
professional diploma in educati~nal su~rvision, from 
Columbia University. She has slOce received 31 
honorary doctoral degrees. 

In 1972, Chisholm became the first black woman to 
seek the Democratic Party nomination for the office 
of president. Although she did not succeed, she wrote 
The Good Fight, the story of her bid for the presid-
ency. She also wrote Unbought and Un bossed, the 
autobiographical story of her political career.

According to a spectator who 
wished to remain anonymous, the 
program began about 40 minutes 
late, when a woman entered the 
lecture hall to music. 

"Then she took off her long 
pants and then she had someone 
take off her lace stockings with 
their teeth," the spectator said. 

"She had on a large bikini top, ~ 
the spectator continued. "Even-
tually, she took that off and she 
took off whatever was around her 

waist to reveal the G-string. And 
then she mingled with the audi-
ence. Basically, a lot of male faces 
encountered some cleavage." 

According to another specta-
tor, also speaking on the condi-
tion of anonymity, the stripper 
"was completely topless. She was 
walking from aisle to aisle,letting 
guys grab her and letting them 
suck on her [breasts). ~ 

Later, the stripper and another 
woman were covered with oil by 
audience members before pro-
ceeding to wrestle on a mat in the 
front of the lecture hall. 

A man from the audience later 
joined the wrestlers in his shorts,

A.S. Discusses Women's Resource 
Center, Sun God Festival Plans 

~t~ 
IU C S D 

III GRAND OPENING 5K RUN By LAURA PROCTOR 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council last night 
approved a resolution favoring 
the consistent administrative 
funding of the Women's Resource 
Center (WRC), so the organiza-
tion will not have to go to the A.S. 
for budget requests, as it does 
now. 

"This is the first step for a larger 
dream," said Lisa Cauble, a spo-
kesperson for the WRC. "This is 
the chance for the A.S .... to say 
something to the administrators: 
'Put your money where your 
mouth is.' " 

The Council voted unanimously 
to support the WRC with the 
funding resolution. 
. The Council later passed two 
proposals pertaining to the Sun 
God Festival. 

Instead of charging students $1 
to attend the Festival, the Council 
allocated $4,000 from the General 
Unallocated Fund to make the 
event free for students. The charge 
for non-students will be $2. 

A separate measure was passed 
for a $6,070 underwrite to fund 
the sale of Sun God novelty items 
at the Festival. 

Initially, many councilmembers 
opposed the measure, because the 
money was to come from Man-
dated Reserves. The proposal was 
then amended to pull the money 
from Gerneral Unallocated in-
stead. 

Programming Commissioner 
Jonathan ludaken spoke at length 
against drawing from Mandated 
Reserves, saying, "That's not 
money that should be manhandled 
in this way." 

Sun God visors, cool cups, key 

chains, cups , shot glasses, and T-
shirts will be sold at the Festival.

Judaken argued that too many 
novelty items were being ordered. 
Approximately 4,000 people will 
attend the Festival, he said, and 
almost as many items were being

to expect all the items to sell.

D R . THO MPSO N IS on medical leave in New Orleans, where he remain in critical condition at a secret rabies clinic 
operated by the Pasteur Institute .... Thompson was rushed to 

New Orleans in a private jet after being severely mauled and bitten by a 
huge animal that local authorities said was "clearly in the final stage of 
raJies. " 

Witne ses at the scene gave confused accounts of the attack, which 
occurred as Thompson was receiving a blood transfusion on his sun 
deck in Woody Creek. A local farmer, who was first on the scene, said 
he watched helplessly as Thompson - covered with blood from the 
interrupted transfusion and more than 100 bite wounds - beat the 
animal to death with an aluminum baseball bat. Another witness, a 
Swiss health technician, said the animal "weighed at least 200 pounds" 
and appeared to be a huge red fox "more than four feet long." 

Other accounts were flawed by hysteria or personal bias. The 
author, a lifelong naturalist , has been the target of a nationwide 
campaign of slander and abuse by extremist elements of the SPCA, the 
Audubon Society, the Bohemian Club and other fanatics on the fringe 
of the so-called Animal Lover's Movement. 

o details of the recent attack were available, despite outraged 
protests by members of animal groups who charged a "cover-up" and 
called the writer a "brain-damaged pervert" and a danger to the entire 
animal kingdom. 

They cited inflammatory news reports last year that accused 
Thompson of torturing and mutilating a red fox that he had trapped in 
a cage filled with feathers, glue and peacock dung. 

Semmes Luckett, Thompson's executive counselor, ridiculed these 
charges and invited reporters into the home to see Thompson's private 
art collection, which included a priceless oil painting entitled "The 
Peaceable Kingdom" by Benito Mussolini that he said had been on the 
wall of Thompson's library "for at least 16 years." 

Luckett angrily denounced these charge as the work of "bigots and 
hate-monger ." He described Thompson as a "lonely pioneer in the 
field of rabies research" and produced more than 1,000 letters as 
evidence that "public response is running 5-1 in the Doctor's favor." 

To the Editor: 
Dr. Thompson is a braver man than I am. That fox could have 

ripped his Ihroal OUI or jumped on his neckfrom behind. Afox with a 
snOUl full of blood is more dangerous Ihan Hitler. 

Where do these knee-crawling screwheads get Ihe gall 10 queslion 
the wisdom and sleepless integrity of a true humanilarian who risked 
rabies and syphilis to rid the world of a stinking evil-treacherous. 
egg-sucking vermin like a redfox? 

I have long despised Thompson and everylhing he standsfor, but his 
incredible display of courage brought tears 10 my eyes and will never be 
forgo lien. Thank youfor allowing us 10 share that beaUliful moment 
with him. He is a credit to his race.

T HE 39TH ED ITION of the Physicians' Desk Reference, long recognized as a basic reference text for the medical industry, 
carries a lengthy discussion of a new rabies vaccine known as 

"Duck Embryo/ Dried Killed Virus," developed by Eli Lilly a nd Co. to 
ci rcumvent the use of brain tissue since it has been demonstrated that 
duck embryos contain little or none of the "paralytic factor~said to be 
present in brain tissue. 

The PDR goes on to cite arguments for and against "giving rabies 
vaccine" to otherwise doomed individuals: 

"In favor of giving it, "the journal continues, "is the fact that, if rabies 
develops, it will almost certainly have fatal results ." . .. "Against giving 
it is the danger of severe side effects involving the central nervous 
system, including irreversible mutation - especially if exposure was 
severe (mUltiple bites on the head , neck, face or arm)." 

The victim in this case sustained 116 deep-puncture wounds in the 
area of the neck, face and lower brain. (The animal was described as 
"huge and uncontrollably vicious - a red fox the size of a timber 
wolf. ") The medical prognosis - although shrouded in morbid 
diagnostic gibberish - was made clear on page 1,053 of the PDR, 
under the heading of "Adverse Reactions": 

Local reactions to the injected material have been observed to be 
fever and some less severe than those seen with vaccines of brain 
origin. ... Varying degrees of erythema and induration tend to appear 
from the sixth to the 10th day of treatment. ... 

Regional lymphadenopathy may also be encountered , since this 
material is a protein and foreign to the human body .... Unicaria, 
'respiratory distress (including dysnea, bronchospasm and gastro-
intestinal disorders, e.g. abdominal cramps, nausea , vomiting and 
diarrhea) have occurred. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported. 
In one horrifying study, terminal anaphylaxis was observed in 0.5 to 
0.9 peTcent of recipients .... Constitutional rea.ctions are difficult to 
evaluate because ofthe patient's tendency to be apprehensive about the 
situation, but the development of fever, malaise and drowsiness calls 
for careful observation ....

AIDS Exhibit 
Is Insensitive 
Editor: 

The exhibition presented by 
the Grove Gallery, entitled Por-
traits In The Time Of AIDS by 
photographer Rosalind Solomon, 
is an exploitation of people with 
AIDS. The show represents a 
reactionary response to the epi-
demic that is neither sympathetic 
nor promotes an understanding of 
the complex issues surrounding 
this disease. The exhibition is a 
glaring example of a trend of vic-
tim photography that claims em-
pathy as its goal, but results in the 
further marginalizing of already 
neglected groups. 

Rather than creating a project 
that promotes political awareness , 
the importance of collective re-
sponse, and AIDS activism, the 
photographs in this exhibition 
serve up people with AIDS as 
monsters - aliens illiciting dis-
gust - much like the si nce illegal-
ized carnival freak shows that used 
to · abound here and in Europe. 
The show promote an image of 
people with AIDS as alone, inca-
pacitated, and waiting to die. This 
ignores the grassroots collective 
eltorts that have organized in 
spite of government neglect and 
cultural / societal prejudices -
organizations most often run and 
operated by those who are H IV 
positive . 

Whether the image is of an 
individual in activist garb or with 
family, the message is still one of 
abandonment, alienation, and 
impoverishment. Solomon has 
taken that most photogenic of 
opportunistic infections, Kaposi's 
sarcoma, and produced a series of 
photographs that is less about the 
individuals she purportedly is 
photographing, than the sensa-
tional spectacle of a disease that 
has to date killed about 50,000 
people. 

The debates surrounding vic-
tim photography, debates that 
can be witnessed around images 
of the poor, the homeless, and the 
neglected (al1 of which are projects 
Solomon has engaged in) are well 
documented and available to the 
profe sional artist. Solomon's 
'disregard for the ethical questions 
implicit in this kind of art practice 
is either naive, a kind of naivete 
that in 1989 is insiduous, or will-
fully sensational. In the end, what 
is delivered in these photographs 

rw.'f A 
Hlmro 'IE}/.' 

\ 

A WASHINGTON TALE 

is Solomon's venture into the 
"danger zone;" her heroic safari 
into the leper colony of "AIDS 
victi ms." This has been done at 
the expense of a n exploration 
that would reveal the efforts of 
those affected by the virus: their 
social and political activism; their 
fortitude in the face of govern-
ment neglect; their individual and 
collective responses to the crisis, 
that are forcing changes in the 
way our society understands and 
em pathizes with those who are ill.

Election Signs 
Are Annoying 
Editor: 

I am not ever going to vote 
again. Well, maybe once more ... 
I may vote against the candidate 
for public relations who is putting 
up all those orange on white bill-
boards in my way on the walk-
ways . 

When 1 registered to vote for 
the presidential elections, I got a 
lot of junk mail from politicians. 
It was very annoying. I did not 
vote for anyone. 

Now, the campus is littered 
with these billboard things. In 
previous years (at least from 
1985-86 to 87-88), there were no 

such tactics. Especially annoying 
are the orange and white ones 
from the person running for pub-
lic relations, which are strategi-
cally placed where the greatest 
density of people walk. They 
would be much better placed on 
the lawns just off the walkways.

of the ~heavy metal rebel" which 
he parades around campus, each

attention. His entire demeanor 
and attitude practically scream 
out, ~Notice me! I'm so different!

Originality is something that 
should come naturally; those who

Dimmesdale 
Continued from plge S 
hike to finance an amphitheater. 

Maynard is hoping that the 
vote of confidence in the Chancel-
lor fails miserably, so he can go to 
the Regents complaining about 
Atkinson. But what the Regents 
and students will not see is a refer-
endum question that is a vote of 
confidence of the A.S. Council. 
Students will not see this because 
Maynard vetoed it . He was afraid 
he wouldn't have a leg to stand on 
if the A.S. Council confidence 
question failed . 

The truth is, Maynard killed his 
own argumCRI against the Chan-
cellor by vetoing the A.S . Council 
vote of confidence referendum. 
But students don't know May-
nard vetoed the referendum, and 
he of course will proclaim himself 
a martyr for the cause of student 
rights when the regents laugh at 
him. Right after taking the stu-
dents' freedom of choice away by 
vetoing referenda questions. Not 
one but two! 

Maynard's second veto was on 
the Sports Upgrade Referendum. 
The referendum called for a S5 fee 
increase to support the badly 
underfunded intercollegiate pro-
gram which forces students to pay 
their own money for sports-related 
costs. But Maynard was afraid 
that students would only be wil-
ling to vote for one fee increase. 
This would jeopardize the refer-

endum he authored, the amphi-
theater referendum. So inan effort 
to see that his own referendum 
would pass and to take student's 
freedom of choice away, he vetoed 
the sports upgrade referendum. 
Even though his referendum is 
not binding, if it passes there is no 
guarantee anything will happen. 

It is not easy to see that May-
nard is nothing more than a self-
serving A.S. president trying to 
make a name for himself. The 
problem is he expres~es himself 
well, and says what people want 
to hear. Sooner or later people 
will realize not to take his word 
because he doesn't give the whole 
picture, and, as we can see from 
this election, he doesn't give them 
the whole choice.

verts citizens to criminals. High 
profit and risk attract organized 
criminals. Incrr.ased penalities 
accordingly increase profits and 
suppliers. Extremely high profit-
ability encourages suppliers to 
invest part of their inventory as a 
"free trial offer" to expand their 
market. Free trial offers used in 
conjunction with peer pressure 
increases the number of users. 
Free trial offers used in conjunc-
tion with addicting drugs increases 
the number of addicts. Both 
increase market size. 

The success of these techniques 
encourages suppliers to search for 
more effective psychological ap-
proaches and more addictive 
drugs. Increased taxpayer expen-
diture on enforcement increases 
drug profitability and risk. Ex-

Robison emphasized the impor-

Robison listed the creation of a

Campus Orgs Propose 
Ethnic Names for the 
New Student Center 

By ARLENE SISON 
Slall Writer 

While plans to rename the San 
Diego Convention Center after 
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. last 
February turned into a heated 
debate among San Diegans, a 
proposal to name a new campu 
walkway here in honor of the civil 
rights leader went vinually unchal-
lenged. 

But a controversy does exist 
concerning the selection of names 
for rooms at the soon-to-be-
opened Price Center. Some stu-
dent leaders feel that the U niver-
sity should choose names which 
will meet the needs of student 
groups who are look.ing to repre-
sent cultural diversity through the 
room-naming process. 

Third College sophomore Gay-
atri Gunasekranexplained that at 
a University Center Board (UCB) 
meeting last quaner, board mem-
bers expressed their desire to name 
a place at the Price Center in 
honor of Dr. King, and "they 
liked the idea of naming the free 

speech area after him," Gunasek.-
ran said. 

In November, members voted 
unanimously to name a path at 
the Price Center "The Dr. Manin 
Luther King Jr. Walkway." The 

. walkway connects two free speech 
locations that are between the 
current Student Center and the 
Price Center. Although final ap-
proval for the walkway name 
rests with the University adminis-
tration, UCB members are confi-
dent the name will be approved. 

According to UCSD alumni 
representative Paul Ey~amp, the 
board's decision to name the walk-
way after King "fit the concept 
that reflected what Dr. Kingstood 
for and accomplished, such as his 
advocacy of free speech, the march 
on Washington, student involve-
ment and the civil rights move-
ment." 

At a following meeting, the 
UCB's Naming Committee sub-
mitted a list of names for seven 
rooms at the Price Center: a ball-
room, theater, gallery, meeting 
room and three lounges. The

that upon submitting the list to

the list of "basic names" would

Subsequently, college represent-

disapproval of proposed names. 
The groups insisted that the rooms 
be named after people who repre-

WILLIAMS REDEFINES 
CLASSICAL GUITAR 

For European audiences of the 1920s, filling a huge auditorium to 
hear the performance of just one instrumentalist, and a guitarist at that, 
was a strange idea at best. A piano recital was certainly nothing new. 
The guitar, however, mainly associated with various folk traditions, 
had not gained the social acceptance as an instrument to which the 
word "classical" could be attached. 

There was little in the way of musical literature, as few composers 
had discovered its joys, and even fewer guitarists had taken on the task 
of arranging violin and piano music for it. There was a lack of both 
supply and demand, and therefore, no performers. 

One man, and an entire generation of his students, changed all that 
and helped make "classical guitar" a well-known musical expression. 
Andres Segovia single-handedly created a devoted audience in the 
inter-war period by gracefully turning the ears of kings, queens, and 
music critics alike. 

Generating his own arrangements of Mozart and Bach at the rate of 
hundreds per year, he soon built up a repertoire for the instrument that 
numbered well into the thousands. With almost religious devotion he 
set out to bring classical guitar to the world. 

A post-war generation of students helped him to realize his mission. 
In 1951, the 100year-oldJohn Williams be2an to study with Segovia. 
Today he is one of the greatest inheritors 01 the classical guitar tradi-
tion and heir to Segovia's legacy. Appearing tonight at Symphony Hall, 
he is sure to provide the beauty and grace that have made this instru-
ment what it is today. 

Born in Austialia in 1941, Williams began studying the guitar with 

by arthur .. h 
.taft writer 

his father at the age of four . His family then moved to London, where 
he met Segovia. On Segovia's recommendation, Williams entered the 
Academia Musicale de Siena in Ital¥. where he studied for five years. 

In England, he attended the Royal College of Music, studying piano 
and music theory. 

John Williams made his London debut at Wigmore Hall in 1958; 
highly successful debuts followed in Paris and Madrid. In 1962, he 
toured Japan.and the United States. He has since been a regular visitor 
to the United States and Europe and has appeared on almost every 
continent. 

Williams opened his current season with a series of recitals in 
England and Ireland. In October, he visited Paris for a recital and a 
performance of Brouwer's FCNrth Guitar Concerto. His extensive U.S. 
tour includes San Francisco, Houston, Toronto, as well as San Diego. 
His talents have stimu1ated many composers to write for him, includ-
ing Torroba, Stephen Dodgson and Andre Previn. 

His San Diego program includes Six Sonatas by Scarlatti and the 
Chaconnefrom Bach's Violin Part ita NO. 2 in D Minor, both transcribed 
for solo guitar by Williams. FollOWing intermission there will be a 
selection of five highly varied works by composers closely associated 
with Williams: Juquijro Yocoh, Augustin Barrios Mang<>re, Astor 
Piazzola, Leo Brouwer and Andrew York. 

Showtime is 8 p .m. Single tickets range from $12 to $32, though 
students can purchase two for the price of one. Come out tonight and 
hear the classical guitar tradition come alive!

Powwow Surprisingly Good 
by phil maclovem 

hiatUi ataff writer 

The big hit of the year (whether 
or not it was because of quality, I 
won't say) was this year's Best 
Picture, Rainman. Basically a road 
trip picture about a man and his 
autistic brother, it was a movie 
that both broke new ground and 
ate other films' dust. 

The movie Powwow Highway 
is very similar to Rainman, but I 
don't think there can be any fair 
comparisons. While I enjoyed 
Rainman (yes, I do enjoy some 
movies) I wasn't very impressed 
with its overall quality . The story 
was too obviously shooting for 
Academy award nomination, but 
fine acting by Dustin Hoffman 
pulled it through. Powwow High-
way is a better movie, mostly 
because of a beautiful story. 

to start things off. Buady Red 
Bow is the "difficult" Indian, the 
main fighter against the land sale. 
His sister is jailed in New Mexico, 
in an attempt to get him out of 
Montana before the Tribal Council 
votes on the sale. 

But this is not the main story, 
just as Tom Cruise's money desires 
weren't in Rainman. The core of 
this movie is Filbert, an overweight 
childish Indian who starts to have 
visions, and is convinced that it is 
his time to become a warrior, to 
bring good "medicine" back to 
the tribe. 

His quest for manhood requires 
the discovery of four tokens which 
must be found after a trip of 
praryer and self-reflection. The 
first job for Filbert is to find a 
pony, which turns out to be a 
very, very beat up Chevy Impala. 

Buddy sees Filbert driving by 

(l to r) Buddy Red Bow (A MaTti~) and Philbert Bono (Gary Fanner) 
rravel down Powwow HiShwaV. 

The story starts in a very poor and asks him to drive to New 
town on an Indian reservation in Mexico to bailout his sister. The 
northern Montana. There is a lure of spiritual gratification is too 
little catalytic side story about much for Filbert to resist and he is 
developers trying to buy the land lured from the path to New Mexico 

"Are You 
My Type?" 

Do you need to know: 
If you are dating the right 
person? 
Preparing for the right career? 
Seeking the best direction for 
your life? 

Then be sure to register for 

much to the aggravation of Buddy 
who wants to quickly get to New 
Mexico and back. 

But Filbert's unwavering and 
endless devotion to the Cheyenne 
religion slowly shows to Buddy 
what the reasons are behind his 
fight to save the tribe . This is the 
true heart of the story, where all 
its meaning is. The way that Filbert 
convinces Buddy to worship the 
Cheyenne gods is heart warming 
and invigorating; it has been a long 
time since I've seen a story of this 
caliber come out of Hollywood. 

But the story is not the only 
thing carrying this film. The rwo 
main characters are played artfully, 
with Buddy Red Bow's character 
personifying the angry young man 
fighting for a cause he doesn't 
quite understand. 

But Filbert is even better, his 
over-weight lovability and ever 
present smile is perfect. The rwo 
performances will get looked over 
when it comes to Oscar time, 
because. this is not a "significant" 
movie that the much over-rated 
Academy likes to honor, but the 
performers are very noteworthy 
and are reasons to see the movie. 

This movie is not perfect, but it 
is close . The photography is 
splotchy and inconsistent, with 
sOme beautiful and awe inspiring 
shots of the Midwest expanses, 
but then there are a few scenes 
where reflections showed on the 
camera lens and the boom mike 
showed at the top of the screen. 
There is no excuse for mistakes 
like these. They take viewers out 
of their involvement with the 
movie and remind them that they

When Pierce Turner opened for Graham Parker at the Bac-
chanal the other night, it's doubtful anyone knew who he was. But 
by the end of his 40 minute set, Turner made sure they remem-
bered his name. 

So why doesn't the rest of the world know Pierce Turner? He 
has the credentials, including two albums which have been 
released by record giant RCA/ Beggars Banquet, and his first 
album was produced by the legendary Phillip Glass. Yet the 
Irish-born rocker has only impressed the critics so far . 

Turner 's music reflects what he sees almost as much as what he 
feels. Having lived on Manhattan's lower East Side for several 
years he's found a plethora of topics and events to concentrate on, 
such as the group of transients he followed through town for 
several days. The result is the glorious title track of his latest 
album, "The Sky and the Ground." Like most of his material , the 
song is more impressive live than it is' on vinyl. 

Though he is by no means conceited, Turner does come off as 
somewhat of a ham in concert. Making jokes about San Diego's 
recent heat wave, Turner kept the audience in stitches between, 
songs. But when he wasn't joking, Turner, along with the other 
three members of his band, provided joyous and inspiring rock 
and roll. 

Pierce Turner falls into the category of unknown l11asters. With 
his musical edge, along with a lot of support, he just might mark 
the map of rock and roll.

The lights are dimmed and you 
close your eyes. Out of the speak-
ers at the front of the room, comes 
a "Chchkch" sound, then a trill 
and a squeek . It sounds like a 
horn, no maybe a flute . Could it 
be a seal? 

You open your eyes into the 
darkened room and move them to 
the spotlightatcenter stage. It's no 
seal. It's a woman singing, freed 

from conventional lyrics, sub-
merged in a wordless vocabulary, 
a world of phonetic poetry. 

She is Jay Clayton, jazz vocalist 
who is scheduled to perform 
Wednesday, April 19 at 8 p.m. at

Waltz Over to the Price Center 
by laura ba~er 
hiatw .taff writer 

The last time I spent a Saturday 
night on campus, I thought I was 
going to hear some good music 
and get a chance to dance, but I 
slipped in a patch of muddy grass 
in front of the gym steps while 
waiting for "the concert that never 
happened." 

Luckily, I turned 21 a few 
months after that and was able to 
save myself from music / dance 
deprivation, an endemic condition 

at this University. 
The construction of a ballroom 

in the new Price Center may offer 
some re lief; the charity ball 
"Strangers in the Night" being 
held Saturday, April 22 certainly 
will. Don't let the word "ball-
room" scare you away. Only the 
first half of the evening will be 
ballroom dance, the second half 
will be rock and roll , with music 
by the Kingpins, a rockabilly band 
that played at a TG earlier this 
year. 

Then again, if the warm, sensu-

ous evenings of late have brought 
out the romantic in you, dancing 
with a partner to the music of The 
Bob Long Band could make for 
the perfect evening. 

Don't let two left feet intimi-
date you; free dance lessons are 
being offered in ballroom and 
swing dance next week, the first 
on Monday, April 17 at noon. 

The 1920s is the theme of the 
ball, which is sponsored by the

versity Center Baord. The decora-

This is the tragedy of modern film

Despite these failings, which are 

quite major, I thought this was a 
wonderful movie. The acting is 
quality and the story is exemplary, 
the best of its genre. It is a good 
and enjoyable movie and deserves 
a large audience response to be 
appreciated properly by the public. 
When making your nighttime

some of the finest film that Holly-
wood can offer.

As part of the grand opening

Iilee to see it become an annual

"This is not just another semi-

"I want this to be an event for

Continued from paae .. 
16 years playing various gigs, 
establishing herself. Eventually, 
she was asked to the vocal chair 
position at Cornish Institute in 
Seattle. 

Clayton 'explains, "There is a 
period when you can't leave New 
Yorle. You have to be there with 
musicillns and get your name out. 
But I am at a stage where I have 
done enough there. I'm at a stage 
where who cares where I write the 
lerter from." 

At Cornish University, Clay-
ton taught four rigorous, sequen-
tial courses in jazz singing. After 
stopping in Sen Diego, Clayton's 
current tour includes Austria, 
Japan, Boston and New Yorle. 

Here in San Diego, Clayton will 
perform with a colleague from the 
Cornish lnstituteJazz Faculty, per-
cussionist Jerry GraneUi . Together 
the duo have a recording on JMT 
Records entitled Sound Songs. 

Music critic Stephan Penderson 
says, "Clayton moves easily 
between styles that are poles apart, 
running the gamut from soulful 
ballads to free form jazz. She trades 
colors, notes, attacks, and phrases 
with the other musicians as though 

. leeys, sticles, and fingertips were at 
her service instead of just an 
incredibly sensitive ear and hair-
trigger reflexes." 

Wednesday night's performance 
promises to be entertaining as well 
as exciting. She sings so freely, 
moving through ballads that only 
when she returns to lyrics will you 
realize that .they were missing in 
the fi rst place.

trees like the Torrey Pines , a stu-
dent could not relate to it as being 
something that made a cOl1tribu-
tion to the student'S education 
and history," he said . 

Harris, who is also a represen-
tative of the Student Affirmative 
Action Committee, suggested 
names like "The Duke Ellington 
Ballroom," or "The Paul Robe-
son Theater, ""because [Robeson] 
contributed to the theater as a 
whole and didn't just target issues 
concerning African-Americans." 

Eric Musurlian, a Third Col-
lege sophomore and member of 
the Armenian Students Organi-
zation, agreed that naming a room 
after ~something like a [Eucalyp-
tus] tree is meaningless." He sug-
gested naming one of the rooms 
after General Antranik, an Ar-
menian hero. Musurlian stressed 
that the Armenian people, when 
compared to other ethnic groups, 
are ~such a small minority." 

"Asians and blacks are repre-
sented in higher percentages than 
Armenians, but ... we should all 
work together to be represented," 

Musurlian said . '" just think the 
Armenian culture hould be rec-
ognized so the students can be 
made aware of our existence and 
that we are a culture which we are 
proud of." 

Stephanie De La Torre from 
MEChA, a Chicano students' 
association, is also in favor of giv-
ing names of cultural leaders to 
the Price Center rooms. She feels 
that cultural diversity is not very 
evident on campus because the 
University is "constantly recog-
nizing white males." 

"Especially in a predominantly 
white school, students don't realize 
that people of color have contrib-
uted to society and have held key 
positions," De La Torre said . 

In regard to naming the walk-
way after King, De La Torre 
claime~ that the walkway dedica-
tion would not be enough. She 
said a building should be named 
after King. 

UCSD's Price Center is named 
after businessperson Sol Price, 
who started the Price Club whole-
sale industry. He donated 52 mil-
lion toward the construction of

the Center. To acknowledge his 
generosity, the University dedi-
cated the facility in his name. 

The recent renaming of the 
Undergraduate Library building 
on Revelle cam pus, now called 
Galbraith Hall, took about five 
years to be approved . According 
to administrative sources, the 
naming of buildings after people 
takes longer than naming build-
ings after places or things. 

Galbraith Hall is named after 
former UCSD Chancellor John 
S. Galbraith, who was known as 
an early champion of library 
improvement and expansion on 
campus. 

According to University Cen-
ter Director Jim Carruthers. the 
students' involvement and at-
tempt to apply people's names to 
the University's rooms is 
unprecedented. 

"First the students [in the Nam-
ing Committee] have to establish 
the criteria which will guide them 
in selecting the types of names, 
whether they're of rocks or peo-
ple," Carruthers explained. After 
the criteria are developed and a list 
of names is presented by a II the 
student groups to the UCB, then 
the list goes to the administration

for final approval, he added. 
As a political gesture by stu-

dents, the A.S . Council passed a 
resolution on March 9to signal to 
the administration that the UCB's 
effort to recognize the multi-
cultural community at UCSD in 
the room naming process "had 
the overall student body support," 
Gunasekran said. 

Eykamp is hopeful that the 
names for the seven rooms at the 
Price Center will be approved by 
the administration and imple-

mented by the end of next year. In 
the meantime, temporary names 
have been placed on the rooms 
for practical purposes. 

Although the naming process 
has become long and complicated, 
De La Torre said she is encour-
aged by the UCB's efforts to pro-
mote cultural awareness at 
UCSD. 

"At least it's a step towards cul-
tural diversity ... and one more 
step is better than no step at all, ~

Update 
Continued from palt 14 
UCSD finished with a 2-1-1 
record. 

The Triton offense was paced 
by attack players Jan ny Choiy-
ovet, Julie Murray, and Holly 
Reynolds who combined to core 
all 24 of the team's goals. The 
defense was led by Nicole Faurie, 
Mimi Liu, and goalkeeper Tracy 
Graham.

chos may have the most talent in 
the nation. but do not always play 
real well together. When they get 
everything together, though, they 
are tough. 

The Sunset Club is comprised 
primarily of older, experienced 
players who have played together 
for quite some time. The players' 
training is minimal, but they know 
the game and they know each 
other_ They are clearly the most 
experienced club in the tourna-
ment and this should prove to be 
their strongest asset. 

words. ~ 0 women's team will be 
as good as Sunset West,~ he said . 

Cal Poly San Luis Obispo is 
the dark horse. They have three 
women with some Nationals ex-
perience, and have the potential 
to upset any of the top three if one 
should falter. 

The Tritons are led by senior 
hole-setter Karen Crawford, a first 
team AII·American, and goalie 
Jefi Paulsen. 

UC Berkeley is not as strong as 
it has been in the past. However, 
it alWays has a strong program in 
terms of numbers. 

UCSB returns all its players 
from last year's team that finished 
second in Nationals. The Gau-

UC In-ine recently lost 19-1 to 
the Tritons. The Anteaters played 
the game without Shannon En-

eseley. their best player. Her return 
should help the team. but it still 
won't be enough for it to chal-
lenge. 

The tournament will give eve-
ryone a first look at two oS the 
'teams that will bid for the National 
Championship. It gives the teams 
a chance to find out where the 
teams stand and what players will 
make a contribution as the season 
rounds into form. 

Major Lg. 
Continued from pale-14 
crowd. 

Perhaps, with the release of 
" Major League," the 'reel' Cleve-
land Indians might inspire the 
real Cleveland Indians to a win-
ning season. According to Sport 
magazine, last year the pitching 
staff gave fans some reasons for 
optimism. In 1988 the Indians ' 
ERA dropped over one run per 
game (to 4.16, their best since 
1982), they had more complete 
games and allowed the fewest 
runs since 1978, threw the most 
shutouts since 1975, and issued 
their fewest number of walks since 
1921. For the first time since 1956, 
they had three pitchers (Greg, 
Swindell, John Farrell and Tom 
Candiotti) win 14 games. 

With "Major League" showing 
that a team can get better despite 
a long losing streak, fans of the 
Cleveland Indians are definitely 
hoping that life can imitate art.

the starters and the second-string." 

Starter Jeff Babcock led the 
Tritons with 15 kills and 17 digs, 
and strong performances were 
turned in by non-starters Kenny 
Blackman (8 icills, 10 digs) , John 
Lee (9 digs), and Tom McCut-
chen (9 digs). McCutchen also 
made an impressive pass during 
one rally when he slammed his 
legs into the stands to save a ball. 

John Lim had 13 kills and 10 
digs for UCSD. Pat Paschal, an 
outside hitter for La Verne, led 
both teams in kills with 16. 

The Tritons travel to face Chap-
man on Friday for a 7:30 p.m. 
matchup.

The Triton further solidi-
fied their po ition as the num-
ber two team in the West with

Men's Volleyball Undefeated in Conference 

Tritons Spike La Verne in Three 
By PHIL GRUEN 
Sports Editor 

It' too bad the men' vo lleyball 
sea on did not begin in April. 
Tuesday night in the Main Gym, 
the Triton won their fifth game 
of the month (against one defeat) 
by trouncing La Verne in st raight 
et , 15-4, 15-5, and 15-9. 

Unfortunately, the Triton own 
a 3-14 record in the month 
preceding April. They currently 
hold an 8-15 record overall, but 
are till ranked 20th in the Div-
ision I polls aero the country. 

Tuesday' victory gave the 
Tritons a perfect 4-0 record in 
their conference, and barring up-
sets by Chapman or La Verne, 
they are expected to head into the 
Pacific Coast Volleyball Champ-
ionship as the number one seeo. 

According to Triton Head 
Coach Digger Graybill, any team 
coached by La Verne's head coach, 
Jim Paschal, i gong to be .8ood. 
"We didn't take them lightly," 
Graybill said. "Last year we had a 
lot of trouble with them." 

This year appears to be a dif-
ferent story. UCSD showed no 
mercy in the first two games, 
blowing out the Leopards by II 
and 10 points, respectively. In the 
final game, La Verne played the 
Tritons to a 9-9 tie before a six-
point run gave UCSD the victory. 

Wya" ROlen ..... ' (juQrcl'~'n 
Detlth from above - Jeff Babcock led the Tritons with 15 kills. 
In fact , the Tritons won the entire 
match without a number of their 
starters competing. 

" We've got a lot of depth on the 

team, a lot more than we had last 
year," Graybill explained. "There 
is only a slight drop-off between

'Major League' Could Be Hit of the Spring 
Will Major Motion Picture Benefit Struggling Cleveland Indians' Franchise? 

Thi year, the start of the base-
ball season is being celebrated 
with the April 7 release of the 
Paramount comedy " Major 
League." The Morgan Creek / 
Mirage production presents a 
Cleveland Indian team that 
enjoys a season a exciting as it is 
unpredictable - one very differ-
ent from those that the real Indi-
ans have been suffering in recent 
years. 

As fans of the Cleveland Indi-
ans sometimes complain, the team 
has not been able to put it all 
together in a long, long time. In 
non-strike seasons, they have not 
finished within ten games of first . 
place since 1959. Sometimes 
referred to as "the mistake by the 
lake," the team always seems to 
wind up in the second division by 
the end of the season. They have 
not had an over-.500 season in 
many year .

Tom Berenger stars as Cleve-
land Indians catcher Jake Taylor 
in the Paramount comedy. 

The Indians in "Major League" 
could hardly fare worse. In the 
comedy with bats and balls that 
was filmed last summer, a former 
show girl inherits a baseball team 
and proves she is no novice when 
it comes to playing hardball. 
Rachel Phelps (Margaret Whit-
ton) makes it clear right off the 
bat that it's going to be a whole 
new ball game when she hands 
her general manager a list of 
recruits that consists almost 
entirely of bargain basement 
ballplayers, including catcher Jake 
Taylor (Tom Berenger), rookie 
pitcher Rickie Vaughn (Charlie 
Sheen), and third baseman Roger 
Dorn (Corbin Bernsen). 

Director David Ward 's screen-
play was inspired by ftis love for 
his hometown of Cleveland and 
the city's big league baseball team.

Cleveland Indians fan since I was

five-years-old," Ward said. "They 
haven't won a pennant in 35 years. 

.. ' Major League' is about peo-
ple trying to make the most of a 
second chance, "Ward commented. 
"It's also about hope - and a 
team with a tradition of not hav-
ing any." 

Making their motio.n picture 
acting debuts in "Major League" 
are former major leaguers Dob 
Uecker, Steve Yeager and Pete 
Vuckovich. 

In addition to acting in the 
film, Steve Yeager also served as 
technical consultant to the film-
makers . .. 'Boomer' was the per-
fect coach, advisor, friend ," Char-
lie Sheen commented. "He's one of 
the all-time great defensive catch-
ers that I grew up watching. Who 
could know pitchers better than 
omebody .who caught guys like 

Don Sutton, Fernando Valenzu-
ela and Orel Hershiser?" 

On July 22, Tom Berenger 
assembled in Milwaukee to con-
tinue flIming. Milwaukee's County 
Stadium would serve as Cleve-
land 's Municipal Stadium. While 
the hometown Brewers were on 
the road, "Major League" 's Indi-
ans would be playing out their 
season. During the two months of 
production there, over 80,000 
people turned out to watch 25 
days of cinematic baseball action. 

On. July 22 Tom Derenger 
accompanied the crew to Nogales, 
Mexico for a day of filming at a 
Double A level minor league ball 
park. Under cloudless desert skies 
3,000 fans watched Tom Derenger 
play baseball. While David Ward 
directed the American crew, pro-
ducer Irby Smith would translate 
in Spanish to the Mexican ball-
players and a third person inter-
preted the goings-on for the
