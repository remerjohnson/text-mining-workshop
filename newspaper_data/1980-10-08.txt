Metzger is 
assailed 
by church 

Stung by criticism of his 
candidacy by a third church 
group, Tom Metzger denies 
he is running a racist 
campaign for Congress. "I 
attempt not to try to insult 
people of any other race, but I 
do speak up for mine," the Ku 
Klux Klan leader said 
yesterday.

The Democratic nominee

themselves by exploiting 
racial tension, that exist in

Disabled Student Services 

BY JENIFER WARREN 
A .. oculte New. Editor 

Rob Clerisse spent the past four years 
remaking the UC Santa Cruz campus. Now 
he wants to do the same thing at UCSD. 

Clerisse, UCSD's new coordinator of 
Disabled Students Services, is the first 
person ever hired by the university to 
exclusively concentrate on the needs of the 
108 disabled students on campus. 

• Extensive awareness programs, expanded 
physical education facilities, the creation of a 
Disabled Students Services Advisory 
Committee and campus transportation for 
disabled students are among the goals 
Clerisse hopes to reach this year. 

"I've spent most of my time so far just 
getting organized and planning awareness 
programs to orient the campus to the needs of 
disabled stud~nts," says Clerisse, who 
arrived here in early July. 

Clerisse has found university 
administrators and staff very "receptive" to 
proposals for development of his program. 

"People at UCSD are concerned about 
disabled students. They just need to be 
educated," says Clerisse. "When I pointed out 
to (campus architects) Chuck Powers and Bob 
Thorburn that the Chancellor's house was 
not accessible to disabled students, making it 
impossible for them to attend the recent 
Chancellor's reception, they said they would 
act immediately to correct the deficiencies." 

Also, the dnnking fountain between the 
Student Center and Revelle Plaza, which 

obstructs the path and poses a problem for 
some blind students, will soon be relocated, 
according to Clerisse. 

The Disabled Students Services Office 
already offers a wide range of services to 
students of various disabilities at UCSD. 

Readers, interyreters and notetakers are 
hired to assist dIsabled students with their 
classes. Special equipment, including 
wheelchairs, cassette recorders and a 
teletype telephone system for the deaf, are 
also available through the office. In addition, 
special parking is provided near campus, and 
assistance with enrollment, housing, test-
taking and personal problems is also 
available. 

One innovative addition Clerisse has made 
to the equipment available to disabled 
students is a special "mainstream" 
wheelchair that elevates students, allowing 
them access to book shelves up to seven feet 
high. Both Central and the Humanities 
Library are equipped with these special 
chairs, which may be checked out by disabled 
students at the Iibrarie's front desk. 

This service will be enhanced next month 
by a "mini-awareness program" for library 
staff, says Clerisse, explaining that library 
personnel need to be made better aware of 
special needs disabled students may have. 

One high priority topic on Clerisse's agenda 
is on-campus transPOrtation for disabled ' 

pi ase tum to pale 4 

population of 2,500. 
Although UCSD does not 

have a faculty exchange 
agreement with the Beijing 
Medical College, the 
university does have 
exchange agreements with 
other Chinese universities. 
There are currently 30 
visiting Chinese scholars on 
the La Jolla campus. 

The Chinese physicians 
will also visit the University 
of California's other medical 
campuses and the Univer-
sity of Washington School of 
Medicine, in Seattle. 

Fedsdump 
waste on 
us coasts 
'Nuke ring' 
now formed 

SAN FRANCISCO 
The federal government's 
decision to dump thousands 
of barrels of radioactive 
waste into the sea off both 
coasts has formed a 
"radioactive dumping ring" 
around the United States, 
Rer' John Burton, D-Calif., 
to d a Congressiona I 
subcommittee yesterday. 

Burton, first of a list of 
witnesses, criticized the 
government's failure to keep 
adequate records on the 
dumping, which began in 
1946 and continued until the 
early 1970s. 

"Various scientific groups 
are disputing the seriousness 
of the problem, and the 
federal agencies have added 
to t he problem by not keepng 
complete records on the 
location and ingredients of 
the dumping," he said. 

The largest dump is 
located about 150 miles off 
the Delaware coast, but the 
,site that has caused the most 
furor is near the Farallon 
Islands, several inhospitable 
chunks of rock about 25 miles 
west of San Francisco. Some 
45,000 barrels were dumped 
there until the government 
outlawed the practice in 
1972.

French Revolution offers valuable lessons on Iran 
BY FRANZ SCHURMANN 
In 1792 the monarchIeS of 

Europe decided to put an end 
to a revolution that had 

p1u~ France into chaos, 
forced its finest nobility to 
flee into exile, and threatened 
to spread popular revolt a-
cross Europe_ The grand ar-
mies of Prussia, Austria, En-
gland and lesser states, all 
ruled by monarchies, invaded 
France, confident of a quick 
victory. 

The analogy to the present 
crisis in Iran may appear 
facile at first reading. But 
peyond the superficial 
similarities - and despite 
aome important differences -
the French Revolution 
offered elemental lessons 
about human nature which 
have been ignored to the peril 
fX thole who seek to cap the 
fountainhead of revolution-
ary movements. 

France then, like Iran now, 
w. in the throes of a 
revolution. Ita armies had 
aeemingly diaint.-ated. The 
new revolutionaries were 

~nc_qainat each other as 
oriainaUy they had turned 
llinat the nobilitr. Counter-
revolutionlry upnai .. were 
eruptine aU aver the country. 
The exiled nobility JIeefu1ly 
awaited the death blOw. 

It never came_ Instead, the 
finest fX Europe's armies 
were routed by a new 
phenomenon in Europe . a 
people's army. 

As 800n as news fX the 
invasion spread, calls were 
issued by the revolutionary 
authorities fOr the people to 
join the arlJ1Y, exactly lL'J in 
Iran today. Thousands more 
responded than were needed,

just as in Iran. AIU ormes 
citoyms . citizens to arms . 
WlL'J the first line of lA 
M.,.m/laise, the song sung 
by volunteers from distant 
Marseilles trekking north-
ward to defend a country 
that the revolution for the 
first time had made real to 
them. 

Not only were Europe's 
fmest armaes utterly routed, 
but a century's military 
principles were thrown into 
the dustbin of history. 

What made the decisive 
difference was the revolu-
tionary spirit of the French 
citizen soldier in contrast to 
the sleep-like obedience of all 
the others. 

The slogans of the French 
Revolution were "liberty, 
equality, fraternity ." While 
both the French and the 
Iranian revolutions grievous-
ly violated the liberties of 
their citizens, both also 
created a sense of equality 
where extreme inequality 
had prevailed, and both 
created a new spirit of 
community and solidarity 

among their peoples. 
Unlike the Iranian 

revolution, the French 
revolution was anti·c1erical. 
Iran recently has seen a 
mighty revival of religion, a 
religion whose greatest 
strength was never its 
priesthood but the fraternal 
solidarity of the small

mosque embedded in the 
heart of the community. 

It is precisely this sense of 
community, this devolution 
for power from the govern· 
ment to the governed, which 
ignites the hostility of the 
Mideast's own "Prussians" 
today. Like the monarchies of 
Europe two centuries ago, 

most Mideastern regimes are 
ruled by dictatorships or 
oligarchies and are marked 
by wide inequalities of 
wealth and little fraternity 
between rich and poor - or 
between poor and poor, for 
that matter .Thus the 
Mideastern elite hardly hide 
their fears that Khomeini 's 
Islamic Revolution will 
spread to, and undermine, 
their own nations. 

That those fears are not 
groundless is su~ested by 
what occurred m France 
when its revolution triumph-
ed. It spawned a process of 
revolution that spread over 
all Europe and into remote 
parts of the world. Wherever 
it spread, it undermined and 
usually destroyed the 
entrenched ruling elites. 

The countries of the 
Middle East have experienc-
ed a variety of coups and so-
called revolutions, but none 
has seen the kind of arousal 
of the peOple that has been 
going on in Iran. Nasser's 
revolution in Egypt failed. 
Sadat has quietly let the rich 
and the powerful resume 
their old position.

He shows me the blue LED 
readout flashing from the 
electronic radar device on his 
dash: 45.8 miles per hour. It's 
a 25-mile-per-hour zone. 

October 5, 1980. Sunday 
noon. My third ticket in six 
months. 

I'm driving north from 
Pacific Beach along La Jolla 
Boulevard listening to a good 
tape. I see a police car pulled 
over on the right. I apply the 
bfakes a bit to slow down but, 
as I pass, the lights falsh on 
anyway. 

.Officer, I say, just a 
warning would do the trick, 
believe me. Did I tell you I 
was a veteran? By :the way, I 
read where they threw one 
case out of court because the 
radar reading was constitu-
tionally inadmissable as 
evidence. Say, is it true you 
just have to meet a quota 
when you give our tickets? 

Officer Bozlee is strangely 
unaffected, aloof. 

I look at the people who 
stare from passing vehicles: 
they smile at me syt!lpathet-
ically, shake their heads in 
solidarity, make faces at the 
cops. I know they're on my 
side. They've been here 
before. 

But still I'll go home and 

dream about my teeth falling 
out and things like that, 
which means, of course, that 
I have tension-inducing 
problems - like insurance 
rates, diminishing finances, 
revivified fear of red and blue 
lights. 

I'm old enough now so I can 
no longer blame it on the 
cops' prejudice against young 
people. And my pale yellow 

Pinto station wagon isn't 
exactly the kind of car that 
attracts much attention from 
the police. 

Could it be something else? 
Reluctantly, tentatively, I 

think of ronsidering the idea 
that the tickets may bedueto 
bad driving. But how can that 

be? 
Understand that I had a 

perfect driving record for 
seven years. Then, one night 
six months ago, I got lost 
while driving to see the Peter 
Sellers black comedy, "Being 
There." Sensing that I was 
driving in the wrong 
direction, I made a quick, 
artful U-turn - in the middle 
of the street and over two sets 

of double-yellow lines. "Be 
careful," my friend had just 
warned me, "there could be a 
cop around." "Nah, Ijust told 
her smugly. "I can smell them 
a mile away." 

I got that ticket, too, 
despite on-the·spot plea 
bargaini ng. I was a 

syndicated critic late for a 
film Viewing_ I had never 
been to that foul suburban 
part . of town_ -I was only 
attempting to conserve gas 
by not driving all the way to 
the distant intersection to' 
make a regular turn. And 
anyway, I said after he 
started to write the ticket. it 
looked like only one set of 
double yellow lines. 

I watched the movie, eating 
red licorice and sulking, 
barely responding to my 
date's whispered levities and 
the mirth on the screen. And 
that was only thefi"t ticket. 

I got the second less than 
three months ago . The 
reason? A quick, artful U· 

turn in the middle of the 
street - the same basic 
violation as the first ticket. 
This time, though, it was 
outside the La Jolla Post 
Office, where I'd gone to pick 
up a package from a gift 
house containing two 
cannisters of tear gas_ I was 
just glad the citation was 
issued before I picked up the 
package: CS spray is illegal in 
California unless you're 
licensed for it. 

I even hesitate to mention 
the fact that I also got a $6 
parking ticket last week from 
our own aHnpus police. My 
motorcycle had no sticker. 

I thought briefly about not 
paying Sunday's ticket, but 
then I remembered what 
happened after my last one: 
after weeks of ignoring it in 
protest,I received a letter that 
said a warrant had been 
issued for my arrest for 
failing to appear in traffic 
court at the prescribed time. I 
paid $45 the next day. 

I've finally figured out 
what I've been doing wrong. I 
know it can't be because I'm a 
bad driver that I've been 
getting ticketed so much 
lately. It's my long hair.

NEWS BRIEFS 

Judge challenged on 
offending homosexuals 

LOS ANGELES - Two 
state judges have asked US 
District Judge A. Andrew 
Hauk, who will become chief 
judge later this month, to 
resign or at least retract a 
recent reference he reported-
ly made to "these faggots 
from Cuba." 

Los Angeles Superior 
Court Judge Stephen M. 
Lachs said Monday the 
comment calls into question 
the judge's impartiality . 
Lachs was appointed to the 
bench a year ago by Gov. 
Edmund G_ Brown Jr. and is 
the state's first openly gay 
judge. 

Lachs said he and Van 
Nuys Municipal Judge Rand 
Schrader told Hauk in a letter 
dated Aug. 27 that they were 
"deeply offended and 
dismayed" by Hauk's 
comment and suggested he 
resign. 

"If I were an attorney 
handling a case involving a 
homosexual, I don't think I'd 
want to appear before him," 
Lachs said- "And if I had a 
client who was homosexual, 
r d be hesitant." 

Hauk could not be reached 

for immediate comment 
yesterday but in a letter to 
Schrader and Lachs on Sept. 
2 he called their criticism 
"presumptous and arro-
gant." 

"The judge's appropriate 
obligation is to apply and 
enforce the law as it is, not 
altered or amended by the 
attempts of activists to 
legalize passing fads or 
fancies," Hauk wrote. 

According to Los Angeles 
Daily Journal, a legal 
p'ublication, Hauk made the 
'faggot" statement at the 

Aug. 18 sentencing of a 
Mexican who had crossed the 
border illegally. 

Iraq: further

BAGHDAD, Iraq - Iraqi 
jets strafed fuel depots and 
the television station in the 
Iranian refining center of 
Abadan yesterday, a military 
communique here said, in 
possible preparation for a 
thrust deeper into the oil-rich 
sector of Iran.

NOW plans to 
add pressure 

SAN ANTONIO, Texas 
- The National Organiza-
tion for Women plans to 
intensify economic pressure 
on the 15 states that have not 
ratified the Equal Rights 
Amendment now that thepS 
Supreme Court has permit-
ted the group's ERA boycott 
to continue. 

"That court victory is Ii 
landmark decision both for 
the ERA and free ~h," 
NOW President Eleanor 
Smeal said Monday. 

The 3-year-old NOW 
boycott calls on labor unions 

and other organizations not 
to hold conventions in states 
where the ERA has not been 
ratified . The s tate of 
Missouri sued to stop the 
boycott , saying it violated 
federal anti·trust laws. Two 
lower courts had upheld the 
boycott, and on Monday the 
Supreme Court refused to 
hear the state's appeal. 

"The courts have upheld 
the merits of our boycott and 
we will go full s~ ahead 
with the boycott,' Ms. Smeal 
said at a news conference 
moments after the court's 
action was announced. She 
was in San Antonio to attend 
NOW's national convention, 
which ended Sunday. 

Phyllis Schlafly, a leading 
opponent of the ERA, called 
the boycott "immoral."

After a five year wait, Erik Mellby finally made it to 
UCSD - as Muir's new assistant residence hall dean. 

Mellby new Muir 
assistant res dean 

BY CARMELITA ROSAL 
Proving that persistence 

has a rewarding result, Erik 
Mellby applied for a residence 
hall advisory position here a t 
UCSD back in 1975, and five 
years later he was notified 
that he finally obtained the 
job as an Assistant Resident 
Dean at Muir college. 

"I find the small college 
concept here at UCSD very 
innovative," says Mell by, 
who had previous residence 
hall advisory experience at 
major universities. 

Mellby has worked as a 
Residence Hall Advisor at 
Indiana Universi ty and Cal 
P!)ly at San Luis Obispo; and 
as chief administrator for 
residence halls at University 

of Arizona. 
v~ has also instructed 

MaL h and English for the San 
Diego Community College 
kdult Educat ion Program 
and has assisted professors 
at the University of Ar izona 
Medical School. 

To encourage students to 
make friends Mellby has 
proposed t he " Make-a-
Friend" program , where 
informat ion is drawn from 
different people and matched 
with tudents who have 
s im ilar interests. 

He has not experienced any 
serious emergent:y s ince his 
job started at Muir, except for 
three false fire-alarms. 

Disabled students 
coordinator here 
continued from pale 1 
students. 

"At UCSIJ the hilly 
campus made getting around 
really difficult for disabled 
students," says CIeri sse. "I 
was able to provide van 
service for students , as most 
areas of that campus are 
accessible by main roads." 

UCSD's campus, however, 
is not designed for van 
transporation and disabled 
students must be transported 
in electric carts. But because 
of funding limitations, 
sufficient transportation is 
still a long-range goal, says 
CIeri sse. 

Funding of the Disabled 
Students Services comes as a 
result of the 1977pass~e of 
Section 504 of the RehabIlita-
tion Act of 1973. 

"The state allocates $465 
annually for each verified 
registered disabled student," 
Clerisse says. "That amount 
is just enough for us to meet 
the minimum needs of 
disabled students as set by 
university policy and state 

and federal laws'." 
Those needs were not 
bein~ met two years ago, says 
Clensse. 

In 1974, CIeri sse, who is 
not disabled, arrived at 
UCSC and began working on 
Veterans Services Programs. 
Two years later, he designed 
the Office of Handicapped 
Student Services/Veteran 
Services and began making 
changes on the campus. He 
counseled veterans and 
disabled students, and 
established contacts with 
various national organiza· 
tions for the disabled . 

CIeri sse's move to UCSD at 
least partially results from 
the s uccess of these 
programs. 

"Once the Santa Cruz 
campus was accessiblp. to 
disabled students, I looked 
around for another univer-
sity in need of a stro"* 
disabled students program, 
.he says. A desire to live in the 
San Diego area, he adds, 
finalized his decision to come 
to UCSD.

'Stardust Metn9ries' 
Focuses on Allen 
A Jumbled Auiobiography 

BY RICK GREENE 
Staff Writer 

Woody Allen 's new motion 
pict ure , wistfully entitled 
Stardust Memories, begins 
with an ending. 

T he open ing s h ot is 
startlin!{ yet fu nny close-up 
of Allen s face. He is s itting 
alone on a train. We hear a 
ticking. The faces which 
surround him are bleak and 
ugly. They are oddly shaped 
and shadowed. A man behind 
him begins to weep. 

He glances over on the next 
track . Another train is 
bursting with women, 
champagne, smiles and 
,unheard lau~hter. Allen tries 
to escape his train after a 
gorgeous blonde on the other 
one 'kisses' him through her 
window, leaving a greasy 
lipstick smudge. But the two 
trains begin to move. All the 
doors are locked. The pull 
cord is just an endless stnng. 
Trapped on a train of silent, 
wretched souls going 
nowhere! 

The final shot is of the 
inhabitants of the two trains 
touring a garbage dump 
surrounded by seagulls. 

This opening, we find, is 
the ending of a new movie by 
comedian Sandy Bates 
(Allen). We are in a screening 
room with the studio 
executives, who vocally tear 
the new film to shreds. We 

a re in the world of a film 
celebrity. 

Bates is a writer-director -

Stardust in New Jersey. His 
fan s are there by the 
thousands and the camera 

. often takes on the rush of 
being swamped by anxious 
and obnoxious afficianados. 
All this is merely a frame for 
Allen to poke fun at his fans 
and critics and to express his 
inner confusion. 

The events unfold on four 
different levels: reality -
Sandy at the weekend, 
retrospective; fantasy - a 
series of sequences featuring 
everything from an elephant 
on the beach to a dialogue 
with aliens from space; 
flashback - used only to tell 
the story of Sandy's love 
affair with Dorrie (played by 
Charlotte Rampling); and 
retrospective sequences from 
the early CQJlledy films of 
Bates' , which hold some of 
picture's biggest laughs. 

(The best of these "old 
films" shows Sandy as 
Sidney Picklestein searching 
for his escaped hostility , 
which looks something like a 
cross between a gorilla and a 
bear.) 

Since ANnie Hall (1977), 
which has been called his 
.. breakt hrough movie," 
Allen's screen world has 
grown closer to his own. 
Now, he can have meaninldul

though none of them are 
permanent and few are 
satisfying. This sudden 
'realism,' many fans argue, is 
ruining his movies, befuddl·

the critics. And this, in part, 
is what Stardust Memories is 
about.

"I'm all right , nobody

Kenny Loggins on the

Whether he 's all right

thing's for sure: the 
Loggins who teamed up 
with Jim Messina for

ANew 
Elvis 
Costello 
BY BARRY ALFONSO 
Sped.1 to the Daily Guardl ... 

If postive record 
reviews translated into 
album sales, Elvis 
Costello would be 
wealthier today than 
Billy Joel, Queen and 
Olivia Newton-John 
combined. Since he first 
appeared on the nascent 
New Wave rock scene in 
1977, he has garnered 
countless praise-filled 
write·ups as singer, 
songwriter and perfor-
mer. But Costello has 
never come up with a hit 
record of his own in this 
country. "What gives?" 
you might ask. 

Pinpointing the reason 
Elvis the Second hasn't 
hi tit really big is 
difficult, but here's one 
possibility - he's simply 
too paradoxical and 
confusing to the public to 
be embraced as a star. 
Fans like to peg their 
favorites, and most ofthe 
newer rock talents are 
easily pigeonholed -
Deborah Harry as punk 
sexpot, Devo as junior 
mad scientists, the 
Talking Heads as 
incipient psychos . 
Identifying Costello's 
musical identity isn't so 
easy. 

He was first promoted 
as rock's new Angry 
Young Man, full of bile 
and misanthropy. The 
label seemed to stick. But 
Costello never exploited 
his trademark nastiness 
in the most commercially 
successful ways. He has 
avoided becoming a 
cartoon of himself, which 
generally is the way for a 
rock musician to win the 
biggest audiences. 

All of which brings us 
to Taking Liberties a ' 
collect ion of Costello 
odds and ends that will 
muddy his image s till 
further_ The 20 tracks on 
the album don't offer the 
fanatical punksters what 
some might expect. What 
they do represent is a 
gifted , professional artist 
who can dabble in old· 
time soul , country. jazz 
ballardy and rave-up 
rock, somehow making a 
credible showing in each 
category. 

Much of the material 
on this record has been 
available before on hard 
to find imports and 
bootlegs. Talti"l{ _ Libn--

"Moonlight Serenade" and 
the beautiful "Stardust,"

Charlotte Rampling,

Louise Lasser (Allen's second

cast down to the last wart

fascinating types with odd 
faces and tartling requests. 
"Will you sign my left

Stardust Memories ends 
with a shock which turn out 
to be just another illusion. 

Allen comes to grip with 
his feelings and motivations 
and appreciates the one brief 
moment in his life when 
everything finally comes 
together ... the morning he 
watches Dorrie on the floor

smiling as "Stardust" plays

But they endured 
obnoxious cut like 
Junkalloo Holiday , 
hoping Loggins would 
wise up and 'mellow out. ' 

His live album may 
have pushed their 
patience too far. The 
single from the LP, I'm 
Alright, is t he most 
offensive song to hit the 
charts since Fleet wood 
Mac and the USC 
marching band did Tusk, 
which the Loggins tune 
resembles. Loggins wails 
and moans through the 
Indian war chant, 
featured in the film 
Caddyshack. The song 
ha s a parti c ularly 
irritating set of back· 
ground vocals. 

Loggins fans who have 
been loyal since his split 
with Messina years ago 
may find this new 
approach, not to mention 
his declaration ''I'm 
alright," too much to 
stomach.

tunes, specifically "(I 
Don't Want to Go to) 
Chelsea," were hi ts for

including "Girls Talk" 
and Talking in the

" Black and White

Several o( the songs 
are so good, in fact, that 
it's strange they wern't 
released on Costello's US 
albums. The aforemen· 
tioned "Chelsea" is a 
riveting slice of Costello 
paranoia, an account 
(apparently) of lecherous 
old men, cheap floosies 
and the British porn 
trade. 

"Tiny Steps," featur· 
ing the s hrill organ 
effects of Steve Nieve, is 
an equally sleazy 
narrative comparing a 
degraded woman to an 
old doll. Best of all is the 
abstruse but intense 
"Big Tears," a series of 
jumbled images roared 
out by Costello in his 
most manic recorded 
performance. 
Taking Liberties is not 
simply a showcase for 
Costello's much discus· 
sed hostility, however. 
You'll also find one of 
the most bittersweet

ask for, "Stranger in the

These gold artifacts are on di play a part of "The 
Golden Treasures of Peru," showing at the San Diego 
Museum of Art in Balboa Park through the end of Nov . 
The exhibit dates back to 200 BC, at the time of the 
Spanish conquest. 

Peruvian Gold Exhibit 
Ends US Tour Here 
Spotlights Cultural Advances 
During Spanish' Conquest 

BY BLAKE SHAW 
Anyone interested in 

learning about t he history 
and culture of the civi li.za· 
tions of ancient Peru, or just 
interested in seeing some 
$10,000,000 worth of gold 
artifacts, should not miss 
'The Golden Treasures of 
Peru,' on display through 
Nov. 30 at the San Diego 
Museum of Art, in Balboa 
Park. 

The exhibi t traces five 
Peruvian cultures and dates 
from 200 BC to 1532 AD, the 
time of the Spanish conquest. 
The tour begins with a four· 
minute film, a short history 
of how the Peruvians 
accumulated so much gold. 
The display is chronological, 
with the pleasing result that 
the artifacts become more 
spectacu lar as you progre s 
from room to room. 

The lighting of the piece is 
dramatic - the rooms are 
dark while the gold is lit from 

above. The artifacts are set in 
cabinets lined with brown 
velour. Visitors may wander 
at their own pace, listening to 
a description through small, 
hand carried "sound wands" 
which pick up radio me sages 
about the exhibit as different 
displays are approached. 

The earliest pieces are 
simple artifacts such as no e 
ornaments, bowls and small 
animal representations. The 
most ornate use of gold on 
display is from the Chimu 
civilization (100·1470 AD). A 
pair of golden gloves from a 
deceased noble, a five-foot· 
long poncho with 13,000 thin, 
gold, sequ in ·type adorn· 
ments and an entire golden 
miniature funeral procession 
give an idea of how much gold 
these civi lizations must have 
had . 

Unfortu nately, few Inca 
artifacts are avai lable for 

Th& Daily Guardian 

display. The Inca cities of 
opulent wealth and beauty 
were thoroughly plundered 
by the Spanish conquesta· 
dors. After their smallpox 
had decimated the population 
and civi l wars were in 
progress, conquistadors 
ea ily oonquered the Incas 
and used their tomb a 
official gold mines - meltmg-
the treasures into coins and 
ingots. 

The nearly 300 artifact on 
display are on loan from the 
Peruvian gov~rnmen t. San 
Diego is the last stop on the 
three·year American tour 
organized by the American 
Museum of Natural History 
in New York. Admis ion is

Playwrighting Prize 
continued from page 5 
Getting the first play 
produced is hard, but 
getting people to recognize 
you and read your stuff is 
also important." 

Foreman's first play, 
The Ballad 0/ Charlie 
Sweet/e~ Vine, won the 
Lorraine Hansberry 
Award for playwrights. He 
used the prize money to 
mount a production of the 
'llay in Rockford , Illinois. 

After graduating from 
Antioch College in Ohio 
with a degree in e1emen· 
tary trlucation, Foreman 
went to Northern Illinois 
University (NIU) for less 
than a year and then 
headed west . "I left NIU 
because I felt I wasn't 
learning what I felt I 
should be about writing," 
says Foreman, a native of 
Philadelphia. 

When asked why he 
picked UCSD as his next 
stop, Foreman explains, "I 
looked at the faculty here 
and I was impressed. Also 
they are building the new 
theatre. I wanted to be on 
the West Coast, too, 
because the motion picture 
industry is out here." 

Screenplays appear to 
be. the next step for 

Foreman. He has started 
writing his first screen-
play this quarter, and is 
pleased with its progress. 

One reason why Fore-
man says he is interested 
in screenplays are the 
monetary benefits . "A 
half-hour teleplay can 
make $3500, an hour 
teleplay $6,500 and for a 
movie-of·the·week screen-
play, about $25,000. And 
that's not bad for a one· 
shot deal. 

"People who write TV 
screenplays rarely go back 
to the theatre. They're 
seduced by the money, and 
I can't blame them," 
Foreman says. He still 
plans on writing plays and 
trying to get them 
produced. He would like to 
see his plays produced in 
major theatres but 
confesses, "I'd like to see 
them done anywhere. " 

Directing might also be 
in the future for Foreman, 
who is planning to finish 
his MFA by 1982. "I would 
like to do some directing in 
the future, if the play says 
something important and I 
like it. But the experience I 
want ~t now is to be the 
playwright Irought in, the 
person who can say 'this is 

good,' 'that's not right ,' 
that kind of thing." 

Foreman has been 
involved with the theatre 
most of his life, but only 
recently has been behind 
the curtain. " . used to act 
most of the time but 
writing was something I 
hadn't done in the theatre, 
and I was excited about 
trying it." 

Alfhough he enjoys 
acting, Foreman admits he 
has no strong desire to 
return to the stage. Right 
now he would have a 
difficult task finding time 
to act between his 
schoolwork and the four to 
five hours a day he spends 
writing. 

The black theatre is 
another Foreman project. 
Having worked with it in 
Illinois, he hopes to work 
with the Southern 
California Black Repera-
tory Company here in San 
Diego. 

Until then Farre\1 
Foreman will go back to 
his writin" and, as . he 
explains, 'Bang, bang, 
bang on the typewriter 
until I come up with 
somethillft that works."

'Ordinary People' is 
a WASPish Mirror 

Reflects Well on Redford, Hirsch 
BY VAN SPURGEON 

Based on Judith Guest's bestselling novel, 
the film Ordinary Peqple is an extraordinary 
portrait of a family trying to recover from the 
drowning death of the eldest boy. Closely 
following the structure of the book, the film 
opens as the younger boy, Conrad (Timothy 
Hutton), returns to his troubled home in an 
affluent lake forest suburb after undergoing a 
period of shock treatment and hospitalization. 
In a series of short scenes and flashbacks , the 
film deftly establishes the strange triangular 
relationship between Conrad and his parents, 
Calvin (Donald Sutherland) and Beth (Mary 
Tyler Moore). 

Much of the film is shot in a grimy 
psychiatrist's office where Conrad readjusts 
to his own guilt - he "forgives" himself with 
the support of Dr. Berger (played by a self· 
righteous Judd Hirsch). The mood in the office 
- where the depths of the family tragedy are 
explored - is the most striking and foreign 
element in the film; it exists in sharp contrast 
to the superficial world of parties and stock 
quotations that surrounds it. 

In his directorial debut, Robert Redford 
successfully manages to push the drama 
through to the end. He seems to have a clear 
conception of what it is he's after and then 
goes after it thematically. This narrow vision 
becomes tired and worn after two hours, but 
some people I talked to thought it worked. 

I suspect the reason the film seems to be so 
intellectually poignant is its dramatic 
performances. Mary Tyler Moore is excellent 
In her role as the still· maternal figure 
sensitive only to the advertising schemes of 
large department stores. I think we've always 
subconsciously seen her as a cold villian 
beneath that cheery veneer. 

As the confused husband and father, Donald 
Sutherland draws us into his growing need for 

affection and forces the viewer to experience 
his pain vicariously. By far, Timothy Hutton 
has the most demanding role: he has no 
significant dialogue in the first half hour, yet 
manages to create an unbalanced, fragile 
persona through gesture. 

Oddly, there is no dramatic climax where 
the performances themselves might blossom. 
The melodrama is consistently intense and 
ends with Calvin's realization that Beth has 
no real love for himself or Conrad; she has 
effectively buried it with her dead son. Since 
the audience has understood this deceit from 
the onset, it has little impact. 

The film is about intense emotions - hate, 
fear , lust, guilt, desire, love. It demands a 
personal response. In spite of this, I felt the 
characters lacked the depth that would make 
us tare about their personal struggles. Often, I 
had the tendency to say, "So what?" 

Essentially, Ordinary People has the 
Scandinavian intensity of a Bergman film 
without the inte llectual texture . 
Nevertheless, this film will strike a chord in a 
great many people who will identify with the 
characters. The public tends to look for itself 
in movies; in this context Ordinary People acts 
as a gigantic mirror. 

John Bailey's cinematography enhances the 
film's potential for interest . Although the 
flashbacks to the drowning scene look as if 
they were shot in a bathtub, the photography 
is just simple enough to barely avoid 
appearing lianal - the proper intention. 

The score also manages to pull the audience 
into the drama . Like Kramer vs. Kramer, this 
film should sweep the Academy Awards. You 
may want to see it for this reason alone. 

Ordinary People is playing exclusively at the 
Valley Circle Theater. 

Theater Class with 
Schneider Offered 

A unique UCSD Extension program for 
the public, "Behind Scenes: Theatre in the 
Making," will begin this fall. 

The class will spend three evenings 
virtually participating in the creation of a 
production at the UCSD Theatre, "An 
Evening of Thorton Wilder," directed by 
Tony Award winner Alan Schneider. 

The first class, 7·10 pm Wednesday, Oct. 
22, will be spent with the director, who will 
share with class members his research into 
the play and its characters, how he takes a 
bare script and gives it live through textual 
analysis and his preparation problems. 

At the following week's class, members 
will view rehearsals of selected scenes and 
then discuss them afterwards with the

costume and lighting design.

Well , it had to happen 

sometime. I mean , even Bear 
Bryant loses a game onc!! 
every half decade or so. But 
let's face it. .. this streak was 
something lse. After four 
consecutive years of running 
up and down the field against 
the best football teams that 
UCSD had to offer, the blond 
boys from UNBEAT MEAT 
finally succumbed to the 
pressure of their 31·game 1M 
winning streak last Friday 
afternoon. 

For the record , thescorews 
a lackluster 13-6 . The 
perpetrators ... an assemblage 
of veteran 1M ath letes that 
lived up to their name, CUT 
'NRUN. 

When it was over, the 
players from UN BEAT 
MEAT had to be smiling a 
little though . After all, for 
some of them like Mark 
Lochtfeld and Dave Wies-
ehan, it was ' their firt and 
only football defeat at UCSD 
in what seems like a quarter 
of a century. 

The last time this team 
lost, Bruce Jenner was just 
completing his first Minolta 
XG·l commercial. 

To complicate matters 
worse in the Men's 'MA 
football division, perennial 
MA finalists, Chocolate City 
also took it on the chin this 
weekend, a 12·7 upset loser to 
the Rocky Mountain Oysters. 

With last season's two best 
teams in the early season 
refrigerator, a mad scramble 
for the top of the MA heap 
appears imminent. 

For a quick rundown of the 
1M football power structure 
in Week One, 1980 be sure to 
10k for the always controver-
sial, just released BUD POLL 
ratings elsewhere on this 
page. 

Remember folks, these 
ratings are well·researched 
and highly sophisticated. The 
Czars lock your friendly 
BUD MAN in a dark room 
with a case of his favorite til 
ones and presto!...one hour 
and a good buzz later ... the 
BUD POLL swims into your 
hands. 

No bitchin' at the Czars 
now! They still can't figure 
out how he does it. The 
answer must be somewhere 

RED RAPPER GOES 
FOR FOURTH 

An unprecedented event 
may take place in the Main 
Gym this Saturday after· 
noon when senior Hal Jacobs 
attempts to complete a 
perfect Grand Slam of the 
UCSD Men 's Volleyball 
Double Champion hips. 

Jacobs will team with 
beach personality Monte 
Frankel in their effort to win 
the Open Division title that 
Jacobs has annexed for the 
past three seasons. Interest· 
ingly enough, Jacobs has 
never lost a tournament 
doubles match in the past 
three tournaments and has 
won each tournament with a 
different partner. 

A host of determined 
doubles teams will be out to 
end Jacobs' streak this 
Saturday morning when 
action gets under way in the 
Main and Rec Gyms at 9 am. 

Sign-ups for the double-
elimination tournament are 
still being accepted in the Rec 
Gym office this week in both 
the Open and Novice 
Divisions. Novice division " 
play will commence at 12 
noon.

Feds dump 
waste on 
US coast 
continued from pa"e 1 
dumped at about 50 sites, 
government records show, 

Some environmentalists, 
led by Dr. W. Jackson Davis 
of UC Santa Cruz , say 
radioactive material from the 
dumpsite off the Fara1lons 
has entered edible fish and 
poses a "measurable health 
hazard." 

That is disputed by a 
number of scientists and 
other env ironmentalists, 
who generally say the wastes 
present no hazard and 
probably won't. All, however, 
advocate continued monitor· 
ing. 

Pressure from San 
Francisco Supervisor 
Quentin Kopp and super· 
visors from other coastal 
California counties led the 
House subcommittee on 
environment, energy and 
natural resources, chaired by 
Rep. Toby Moffett, D·Conn., 
to schedule the hearings. 

An assistant administrator 
of the Environmental 
Protection Agency, David 
Hawkins, told the subcom· 
mittee he could not condone 
the procedures or the record· 
keeping. 

"It should be emphasized 
that these procedures, at at 
least some of the dump sites, 
would be considered 
substandard today ... but it 
should be noted that oUr 
preliminary evaluation of the 
environmental ronsequences 

~ these dumping activities 
indicate that there has been 
no apparent environmental 
damage .. .ln this sense, we've 
been fortunate," said 
Hawkins. 

A number of federal 
~cies participated in the 
dumping program, which 
began as a garbqe-disposaJ 
type of operation, acccrmn. 
to a 'I957 federal report. 

According to Davis, the 
leaking barrels have a.ted 
an "intense, localized source 
of radiation" that is sma 
into the food chain. 
isotopes present are some 
those of plutonium, cesium 
and !!trontium. 

Cohen. a public health 
specialist, likens the 
SItuation to the heat 
generated by a 40·watt 
light bulb. 

Costello tries 
continued from page 6 
blues number, "Getting 
Mighty Crowded," gives 
Costello a chance to his 
style in soul music. On 
this album are even more 
unlikely moments . for 
example Rodgers and 
Hart's "Funny Valen· 
tine," crooned over a 
muted backup. 

Costello pulls a Quick 
change on almost every 
track . from slavering 
maniac to slick Motown· 
er to lonesome 'urban 
cowboy' romantic lounge 
lizard without any slip' 
ups, Taki"g Liberties IS 
easy to like because of 
this diversity. It won't 
ever be taken to heart by' 
hard<Ol'e enthusiasts of 
any one tnusical genre. 
but Costello just keepe on 
doing what he does, even 
if it doesn't all fit neatly 
toaether.
