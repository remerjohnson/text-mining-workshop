Warren council 
approves fee ref 

Special elections to be 
held eighth week 

By MARNEITE FEDERIS 
Associate News Editor 

The Warren College Student 
Council recendy approved by con-
sensus a referendum during eighth 
week asking Warren College stu-
dents to vote on a S4-per-quaner 
fee for fall 2004. 

This will be the first attempt. at 
a fee referendum for Earl Warren 
College. According to WCSC 
President Tim Alexander, other 
college councils have larger bud-
gets than WCSC, which started the 
year $4,000 in debt. 

"We are spending responsibly 
and conservatively, but we just 
don't have [a large enough) bud-
get," Alexander said. "We are defi-
nitely in need of some money." 

According to Warren 
Sophomore Senator Brandon 
Blades, the money from the referen-
dum, if passed, would be used to 
provide money for organizations, 
many of which have approached the 
council for funding in the past year. 

"A lot of Warren organizations 
aren't able to fund themselves, and 
we want to put on programs to 
facilitate better out-of-the-c1ass-
room life for Warren College and 
to create new and exciting pro-
grams," Blades said. 

According to Alexander, the fee 
would be used to upgrade current 
programs and to expand existing 
events. 

"The money would go to both 
residents and transfer students, and 
there would be larger programs," 
Alexander said. "We'd be able to 
expand our events like the party 
bus and mystery bus to include 
more people and create big tradi-
tional Warren events like 
[Thurgood Marshall College's) 
MarshallPalooza." 

Alexander said that a significant 
part of the fees would be used to cre-
ate a transfer and commuter board. 

"The board will work on putting 
on events, programs and looking out 
for the interest of commuter and 
transfer students, which doesn't exist 
right now for Warren even though 
the council tries," Alexander said. 
"But you need a bigger budget." 

With rising student fees con-
. cerning many students, some are 

uncertain about having to pay an 
additional activity fee. 

"This referendum is long over-
due," Warren Senior Senator 
Jennifer Klage said. "As a coun-
cilmember, I know that we could 
really use the money to create more

Graduate writing program 
a possibility for UCSD 

By BRYAN TSAO 
Associate News Editor 

The literature department 
unanimously approved a graduate 
writing program on Jan. 14 that 
would award graduates with a 
Master of Fine Arts degree, paving 
the way for the Graduate Council 
to consider the program. 

Currendy, undergraduate 
degrees in literature/writing are 
offered through the literature 
department. The literature 
department currendy offers grad-
uate students Master of Arts 
degrees in English, Spanish, 
French, German and comparative 
literature, but no writing degree. 

If approved, literature profes-
sor Eileen Myles would head the 
program. 

"Professo.r Myles felt that an 
MFA program would stress the an 
side [of writing] as opposed to the 
literature side, and that the MFA 
would give grads a better shot at 
teaching writing, which she veri-
fied by doing an extensive amount 
of research," literature professor 
Michael Davidson said. "It's going

Candidates plan 
for higher ed. 

Loans, service proposals 
target college-age voters 

By JUN MA 
Senior Staff Writer 

With the presidential elec-
tion on the horizon and democ-
ratic primaries heating up with a 
come-from-behind win in the 
Iowa caucauses by Sen. John 
Kerry (D - Mass.), top democ-
ratic candidates are trying to 
reach out and appeal to a 
younger generation of voters by 
proposing different plans to 
make higher education more 
accessible and affordable. 

As the California primary 
scheduled for March 2 

approaches, some students are 
looking for a candidate to pro-
vide the relief and efficient solu-
tions to California's and many 
others states' higher education 
funding deficits. 

"I want a candidate who is 
going to continue or improve 
upon the federal government's 
commitment to my education, 
especially in light of the recent 
tuition increases in this state," 
Earl Warren College junior 
Nick Comfolty said.

Advocate 
• • position 

to become 
appointed 

By NEIL SPEARS 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council approved 
changes to its constitution on Jan. 
21 that would make the commis-
sioner of student advocacy an 
appointed position. The constitu-
tional amendment is still subject to a 
veto by the A.S. president and must 
be ratified by four of the six college 
councils before taking effect. 

The legislation would also 
change the term of the commis-
sioner of student advocacy from 
the current May-through-April 
term to a July-through-June term. 

"The rationale behind this 
process is that the public defender 
is accountable not to the electorate, 
but rather the clients the office 
represents," A.S. Commissioner of 
Student Advocacy Jeff Boyd said. 
"In the same fashion, the commis-
sioner of student advocacy should 
be appointed because accountabili-
ty is not to all of the students at 
UCSD, but merely the students 
who use the services of the Office 
of Student Advocacy." 

Under the legislation, the com-

Computer science professor 

receives Academy Award 
UCSD computer science professor Henrik 

Wann Jensen will receive a Technical 
Achievement Award from the Academy of 
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for leading 
the field in photo-realistic and computer gen-
erated humans in the movies. Jensen, along 
with colleagues Pat Hanrahan of Stanford 
University and Stephen Marschner of Cornell 
University, will be recognized for their research 
in simulating subsurface scattering of light in 
translucent materials during a ceremony on 
Jan. 14. 

The three jointly published "Practical Model 
for Subsurface Light Transport.· Jensen, the 
principal author of the paper, provided a model 
for translating light effects on translucent sur-
faces. 

Jensen has previously been asked to speak 
at major visual effects companies such as 
Industrial Light and Magic and Pixar, where such 
new technology is being used. Jensen devel-
oped a method called 'photon mapping' in the 
1990s to replicate the look of light from sever-
al sources. 

Photon mapping is now widely used in the 
computer-graphics industry, but researchers 
found that the process fails on translucent 
materials such as milk, marble and snow. 
Jensen's method has been implemented in 
movies such as "Harry Potter and the 
Chamber of Secrets" and the second and 
third installments of the "Lord of the Rings· 
trilogy. The award ceremony will be held at 
the Ritz Carlton Huntington Hotel in 
Pasadena, Calif. 

Filmless imaging minimizes

UCSD Healthcare no longer uses tangible 
film for radiographic studies, and have moved 
on to ~Imless imagery that minimizes patient 
inconvenience and potential damage or loss of 
film. 

UCSD has been usinS a Picture Archive and 
Communication system since 2000, when such 
digital modalities as cr, MRI, ultrasound and 
nuclear medicine were put online. Now, howev-
er, UCSD Healthcare is taking a further step by 
putting online non-<ligital mOdalities such as x-
rays, an~ograms, and in the near future, mam-
mography online. 

This system allows clinicians to view the 
images from their offices, homes, when they're 
traveling or even in the operating room. The

Warren: Committee to 
develop referendum language 

Writing: Program would enroll six per class 

conrinwd from page I 
programs and give students more 
of what they need. However, as a 
student, I am not sure if 1 want to 
pay more. The governor is already 
going to make us pay more for 
attending this university." 

Others said that a $4 fee is min-
imal compared to other rising fees . 

"I thinJc that if it's just $4, then 
it's reasonable," Warren sopho-
more Anju Tsao said. "And it's try-
ing to make the Warren communi-
ty more social. Four dollars is not 
too extravagant." 

Warren sophomore Gabriel 
Valerio agreed that the amount 
seems to be reasonable compared 
to other rising fees. 

"With everything else rising, four 
dollars is nothing," Valerio said. "If 
it's anything over $10, then it would 
be extreme. But I wouldn't actually 
go out of my way to vote for this." 

A committee is currently devel-

oping the text for the referendum. 
According to Blades, a proposal has 
been submitted and put to a roll 
call vote, but the vote has yet to 
meet quorum. Blades said that the 
council will vote on the referen-
dum language again on Jan. 22. 
According to Alexander, the com-
mittee is also working on the rec-
ommendations to be put in the ref-
erendum. 

"We don't want to be held down 
to certain expenditures," Alexander 
said. "The referendum committee 
will be deciding on what propor-
tions of the money would be given 
to certain things." 

Students wiJl be able to vote for 
the fee during special elections held 
during eighth weeJc, which will also 
feature a change in the WCSC con-
stitution's language. The dection 
will be on paper ballot and booths 
will be available at Library WaIJc 
and on the Warren campus. 

continued from page I 
to give greater visibility for this 
program. Its always had a pretty 
high profile, but the MFA is kind of 
the detennining mark for a writing 
program. I think its going to bring 
a lot of recognition to a program 
that already has a good reputation." 

According to Davidson, the 
program would enroll approxi-
mately six students per-class, rang-
ing from poets to nonfiction and 
fiction wri ters, as well as incorpo-
rate interdisciplinary cross-media 
programs. According to Myles, 
the program will seek "people who 
want to work across disciplines, 
people brilliant within their genre, 
writers who really wan t to fill the 
role of the public intellectual." 

The program still requires 
several rounds of approvals 
before it would be implemented. 
Approval is required from the 
UCSD Representative Assembly, 
a body made up of faculty from 
all divisions around campus. 

Then, the program must be 
approved in the UC Committee 
for Coordination and Graduate 
Affairs and the UC 
Representative Committee. 

According to Director of 
Graduate Academic Affairs Mary 
Allen, whose office will review and 
advise the literature department, 
the process could take several 
months. 

Nonetheless, many faculty 
members are excited about the pos-
sibility of having a graduate writing 
program and believe that it will 
have a positive impact on the writ-
ing program at UCSD at all levels. 

"I suspeCt there'll be a bigger 
presence of writing on, and com-
ing out of, this campus," Myles 
said. "We'd like to work more with 
local museums, have writing stu-
dents work at Preuss School, 
which we've just not had the peo-
ple power to do, and have a space 
just for readings and writing pro-
jects. In general, be more pro-

active here." 
According to Davidson, stu-

dent response to the program, 
when mentioned in his classes, 
has been positive. 

"When I mentioned the writing 
program in my LiteraturelWriting 
8B class, several people came in to 
talk to me during office hours asking 
'where do I sign up)" Davidson said. 

Davidson also believes that the 
program would help boost the 
reputation of what he considers an 
already strong writing program at 
UCSD. 

"Right now, UCSD has a fairly 
high visibility among what I'd call 
alternative programs, programs 
that stress more innovative, exper-
imental cross-genre work," 
Davidson said. "But we can't com-
pete with the giants of the indus-
try: Iowa, Stanford, places like 
that. But in the kind of non tradi-
tional sort of way, on the vanguard 
or avant-garde, I would say UCSD 
is pretty well known." 

Advocate: Council votes to make position appointed rather than elected 
concinued from page I 

missioner of student advocacy would 
be appointed by the incoming presi-
dent in consultation with the outgo-
ing commissioner and approved by 
two-thirds of the A.S. CoWlCil. 

According to Boyd, who spon-
sored the legislation, the change in 
the dates of the student advocate's 
tenn will allow time for the incom-
ing commissioner and other advo-
cates to be -trained in accordance 
with the recently revised Student. 
Conduct Code. 

Also, the change will allow the 
outgoing commissioner to com-
plete the wave of cases that are usu-
ally resolved at the end of the 

school year. 
In the A.S. elections of spring 

2003, 51 percent of voters failed a 
referendum that would have made 
all of the commissioner positions 
appointed rath.er than elected. 

"The students spoke their mind 
last year, and I believe we should 
respect this," AS. President Jeremy 
Paul Gallagher said. "I believe that 
this legislation wes the choice 
away from the students on who 
they want representing them, 
which in the end is bad." 

. John Muir College Sophomore 
Senator Nam Bui called the legisla-
tion a "special circumstance" that 
does not conflict with the will of 

the students. 
"It will bring better service to ... 

the Office [of Student Advocacy) 
and ensure that students will always 
be represented regardless of the 
political [climate)," Bui said. 

The amendment required 
three-fourths of the senators' 
approval to pass. The final vote on 
the item was 17-1-4, meeting the 
required minimum exactly. 

Thurgood Marshall College 
Freshman Senator Alan Haimowitz 
cast the only negative vote on the 
legislation, saying that the student 
body should have more say in the 
decision.

Council) send the message that the 
students aren't smart enough to 
elect somebody as critical as the 
commissioner of student advoca-
cy," Haimowitz said. "It's the fact 
that we don't put faith in them that 
makes them not want to participate 
in elections." 

Sierra Catcott, Thurgood 
Marshall College senior senator 
and senate chair, expressed that 
having strong senate support of a 
commissioner is more important 
than having the commissioner 
elected because without senate sup-
port, the commissioner will have a 
difficult time performing required 
duties. 

"I thinJc the two-thirds [require-
ment) sort of makes up for the fact 
that it's no longer an elected posi-
tion," A.S. Commissioner of 
Academic Mairs Todd Tolin said. 

When asked before the vote if 
he would veto the legislation, 
Gallagher said that he would hear 
arguments on both sides of an issue 
before maJcing a decision. 

F ollowi ng the council's approval 
of the amendment, Boyd plans to 
visit each college council meeting 
starting Jan. 22 in an effort to 
obtain the four a pprovaJs necessary 
for the legislation to be ratified. 

The change, if finalized, would 
affect this year's AS. elections.

Campaign promises not 
part of the package 

D uring his campaign last fall, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger her-
alded Proposition 53 saying 
"we need a lot of infrastruc-
ture here in California." 
Schwarzenegger, however, 
proposed inJanuary his bud-
get revision to cut $3.4 bil-
lion in funds for road con-

\ strucrion and improvements 
over the next six years. 

Never mind that San 
Diego's uneven terrain 
often makes local roads 
unsafe for drivers and are 
strenuous on vehicles, or 
that regional medical 
expenses are projected to 
increase by almost $2 bil-
lion annually due to lung 
disease caused by height-
ened air pollutIon from 
idling cars. The Southern 
California Association of 
Governments has predicted 
that the funding WIthdrawal 
from planned projects will 
strike a significant blow to 
the state's economy. 

Southern California 
clearly needs to ease the 

congestion that contributes 
to higher business costs from 
hampered transportation. 
San Diego County's plan-
ning agency projects 28,000 
jobs will be lost as a result of 
the axed roadway project 

The proposal does not 
provide any funding for the 
Transportation Congestion 
Relief Program, a 
Proposition 42 mandate 
that qualified the state for 
more than $8 billion in fed-
eral clean-air funds. 

While Schwarzenegger 
makes these cuts, he is hail-
ing a multibillion-dollar 
proposal to develop the 
state's use of hydrogen-
fueled vehicles. Though an 
idealistic goal, it pales in 
comparison to the urgent 
needs of California 
motorists today. 

The $15 billion state 
deficit needs to be closed 
for the sake of California's 
financial ratings, but not at 
the expense of our business 
community or the safety of 
Cali fornians. 

State of the Union 
adresses school issues 
A mid calls for contin-ued support of war 

and tax relief, 
President George W Bush 
introduced several alarming 
social proposals in his State 
of the Union Address that 
would have a detrimental 
effect on the nation's youth. 

Bush outlined proposals 
to grant $23 million worth 
of incentives to schools that 
drug-test students and to 
double funding for absti-
nence education programs. 
While the proposals 
address several problems to 
which youth are undeniably 
susceptible, they are some-
what misguided and foster a 
nai'vete that could prevent 
their effectiveness. 

Bush highlighted budget 
funding of community-
based drug prevention 
strategies as a cause of recent 
improvement in illegal drug 
use statistics amon~ youths. 
Funding commuruties that 
will tackle drug abuse in a 
responsible manner is the 

right way to address a prob-
lem that is rooted in a young 
person's community. 

Granting incentives to 
schools mat offer after-
school programs or "com-
munity-based," comprehen-
sive diug education (not just 
the rheloric of such failed 
programs as D.A.R.E.) 
woUld prove a more effective 
method of eliminating drug 
abuse in young peopfe than 
random drug testing. 

Likewise, while absti-
nence may be the only cer-
tain way to prevent sexually 
transmitted disease - just as 
refraining from drivmg is 
the only certain way to pre-
vent a car accident - to 
favor an abstinence 
approach over comprehen-
sIve education about contra-
ception i~ores the fact that 
teenagers have sex and need 
to understand both the con-
sequences of their actions 
and the precautions they 
must take to prevent disease 
and unwanted pregnancy.

graduate students will pay 54,017 
more in tuition, and nonresidents 
will pay $8,114 more. Tuition for 
professional students has doubled 
in some cases, reflecting an aver-
age increase of 54,081. 

Across disciplines, there is 
tremendous variabi!ity in the 
funding packages that graduate 
students receive. In addition to 
taking courses and writing their 
thesis, graduate students must 
work as research assistants, teach 
at community colleges, work as 
teaching assistants (sometimes for 
more than one class) or as lectur-
ers, or take out loans to pay 
tuition and make ends meet. 
Having to work additional hours 
to pay for tuition leaves many 
graduate students with very little 
time for pursuing opportunities 
that will enhance their vitae and 
thereby distinguish them as top 
candidates when they begin their 
job search. 

The additional tuition increases 
being proposed, on top of the 30-
percent mid-year increase we were 
hit with last year, will simply deter 

students from graduate study in 
California. Fee increases mean 
fewer fellowships. Fee increases 
mean that departments will admit 
fewer graduate students, which in 
turn means that there will be a 
shortage of teaching assistants and 
larger teaching loads. Fee increases 
mean that departments will proba-
bly not admit foreign students. Fee 
increases mean impacted class-
rooms. Thus, fee increases com-
promise the quality of both gradu-
ate and undergraduate education. 
Why not go to Michigan or 
Chicago, or even to a private insti-
tution where your fees might be 
waived? 

The governor says he's com-
mitted to bringing businesses 
back to California.

classes at UCSD and other univer-
sities are hardly relevant to the job 
market. The cycle of "useless" 
knowledge is both a futile luxury 
of the listless elite and maybe even 
an impediment to society's society. 
Linguistics professors teach lin-
guistics to linguistic majors who 
will become linguistics professors. 
There is money to be made, 
mouths to be fed, and little time to 
dally around dissecting word 
roots. 

Such an arg:tment is one-
dimensional, yet sadly, probably 
held by more than a few. The foun-
dation of the argument makes 
sense: Those with college degrees 
make more money than people 
without college degrees. People go 
to college to get a certain kind of 
expertise and learning that suppos-
edly guarantees them a more finan-
cially secure future. These are plain 
facts of Ii fe, and there is nothing 
wrong with maIring money. 

If all one wanted was a practical 
degree for their vocation though, 
then why didn't he or she enroll in 
DeVry Institute or a technical 
school? Especially at a large 
research university, the under-
standing is that a person leaves 
with an education not just tailored 
for the job world, but for life itself. 

Additionally, in this fast-paced 
American society where technolo-
gy reigns, the constant need for 
bigger and better overshadows 
everything else: faster computers, 
roomier cars, bigger rockets. 
Science and cutting-edge technol-
ogy are disciplines in their own 
right, but often relegate the less 
applicable humanities, languages 
and arts to the back burner of 
importance. 

The amalgam of facts, theories 
and ideas that stem from so many 
subjects does not just sit in a mind, 
taking up space. Practical or not, 
they contribute to cultivating savvy, 
intelligent, discerning and well-
rounded individuals. One cannot 
form a credible opinion about any-
thing without obtaining a thorough 
understanding of it first. 

And perhaps the least practical 
learning can breed the most 
intense passions - a habit of read-
ing enriches the mind, a penchant 
for music stirs the soul. Learning 
anything and everything not only 
saves a person from being utterly 
bored but also from being utterly 
boring. Ironically, as a side benefit, 
employers look for diversity of 
interests and traits. 

The problems of society cannot 
be solved by a flick of a switch or a 
new invention. They involve look-
ing within a complex and intricate 
society with complex and intricate 
souls. They involve constant and 
spirited learning. They involve 
knowing the tiCts, contemplating 
decisions, and moving to action. A 
rich and diverse education is prime 
preparation in starting this 
sequence. The danger of an igno-
rant public not only threatens indi-
viduals, but the standard of a pro-
gressive, civilized society as well. 

The opposite of ignorance is 
knowledge - all knowledge. A 
diet of colonial history, Latin and 
Russian lit may at first glance seem 
foolish in comparison to engineer-
ing or biology. Yet all these disci-
plines deplete the "sincere igno-
rance" that King mentions. As for 
"conscientious stupidity," college 
students will always be guilty of 
that.

an issue 
cOnlin~d from page 4 

before declaring impending victory 
for President George w: Bush. The 
most recent drop in the unemploy-
ment rate (from 5.9% to 5.7%) was 
due more to people leaving the 
workforce (i.e., they retired or just 
stopped looking for work at aU) 
rather than the 1,000 new jobs cre-
ated. Moreover, those new jobs were 
well below the projected 150,000. 

Frelich should also be careful 
not to play fast and loose with his 
terms. He dismisses concerns about 
the federal government's budget 
deficit by citing Alan Greenspans 
argument that ' free trade will hel P 
solve the United States' current 
account deficit. While these are 
both deficits, they are not the same 
thing and it is disingenuous to imply 
that Greenspan thinks free trade 
will solve the budget deficit. Indeed, 
in the past, Greenspan has not been 
a fan of budget deficits. Economists 
at the International Monetary Fund 
are also concerned about the hann-
ful effects of the budget deficit, even 
taking into account the stimulus 
effects of the Bush tax cuts. 

The 2004 election is still a long 
ways off, which allows plenty of 
time for the recovery to be felt by 
more Americans or for the "jobless 
recovery" to continue. But before 
announcing the economy to be a 
moot issue in 2004, Frelich should 
get his terms straight and provide 
his readers a complete and honest 
picture of the economy.

6 OPINION 

Budget brings bad 
news for California 

Pressing deficit problem 
requires dire measures 

ByANDIEWOH 
Contributing lllhiter 

On Jan. 9, Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger unveiled his budget 
proposal for the 2004-2005 fiscal 
year. It included radical spending 
cuts that attempt to offset the pro-
jected $14 billion deficit. The gover-
nor may dodge a fiscal crisis, but this 
does not bode well for those at the 
receiving end of the budget cuts. 

Schwarzenegger will have a dif-
ficult time selling his plan to 
Democratic law-

" 

bonds through the ballot. Moody's 
Investors Services downgraded 
California's bond rating to three 
levels above "junk," the lowest out 
of any state in the union. 

These bonds will have to be 
offered at high interest rates to off-
set the high risk of investing. 
Taxpayers will have to finance these 
high interest rates and investors 
will not want or will be unable to 
invest in these bonds. Yet 
Schwarzenegger stubbornly 
adheres to his promise not to raise 

money through 
higher taxes. maleers bent on 

spending more 
money. But the new 
governor is proving 
to be quite shrewd. 
During a special 
session of the legis-
lature, he was able 
to charm the partic-
ipants into putting 
a $15 billion 
"recovery bond" 
plan onto the 
March ballot. 

Assuming that the 
"Higher taxes 

will punish work-
ing families," he 
said. "It will kill 
jobs and drive 
businesses away." 

'recovery band' 
initiative is passed 
and assuming that 

But keeping 
options closed may 
prove to be hann-
ful. "It will be nec-
essary for the legis-
lature to ' look 
beyond' this pro-
posal and consider 
other options -
including addition-
al savings propos-
als and revenue 
increases - if it 

Alongside this, 
the governor wants 
to cut $6 billion 
from state and local 
government, health 
and social programs

recovery brings in 
$2.9 billion, there 
will still be a $6 

billion hole to flU. " 
and transportation projects. This is 
bad news for California's congested 
highways and public services for 
low-income Californians. Services 
such as Medi-Cal, which provides 
health care to millions of low-
income families, may have their 
budgets cut. 

An extra $ 1.3 billion will be cut 
from municipal governments to 
help offset the loss to the state due 
to the repeal of the car tax. Cuts 
from education, $372 million from 
the University of California and $2 
billion from primary and secondary 
schools, will force students to pay 
more for their tuition and impede 
students from low-income house-
holds from attending public uni-
versities. 

Assuming that the "recovery 
bond" initiative is passed and 
assuming that an economic recov-
ery brings in $2.9 billion, there will 
still be a $6 billion hole to fill. 
Implementing this new bond initia-
tive may be problematic on its own. 
Since 1989, California has already 
issued $ II 0.8 billion worth of 

wishes to fully resolve the state's 
chronic budget crisis ~ said 
Elizabeth Hill, the California 
Legislature's nonpartisan analyst. 

But the main reason why 
California is in a budget crunch 
right now is because it spends too 
much money. The government will 
need to raise taxes on the wealthy 
and spend less in order to plug the 
deficit. It is unfortunate but the 
government will need to make 
cruel cuts into sacred pillars such as 
workers' compensation, which is 
double the national average, and 
education, which consumes 58 per-
cent of California's budget. 

"We will not capitulate on 
Democratic core values," State 
Assembly Speaker (D-Culver City) 
Herb Wesson pledged. But stand-
ing by unsustainable spending now 
will be detrimental in the long run 
and will bankrupt the state. 
Schwarzenegger has shown that his 
muscles are for real, but his plan 
stands on uncertainties and does 
not talee other viable options into 
consideration.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN lliURSDAY, JANUARY 22, 2004 

United Kingdom an example 
of things to come for u.s. 

Mad cow unlikely to strike, but more 
regulations are needed to prevent crisis 

ByLOGANGOH 
Senior Staff Writer 

Here's the good news: IT we are 
going to get mad cow disease, we 
already have it, so there's no rea-
son to panic. 

Bovine Spongiform 
Encephalopathy, or variant form 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease as it is 
known in humans, has an average 
incubation period of 10 to IS 
years in humans. Some 
researchers estimate it might even 
be as much as 30 years before 
symptoms begin to appear in 
someone who is infected. \\'hat 
this means is that if our cattle sup-
ply has been contaminated, we 
quite possibly have already eaten 
infected beef and not known about 
it. It will be J1l31IY years before the 
symptoms manifest themselves. 
vCJD normally manifestS itself as 
first anxiety and depression, fol-
lowed by dementia, coma, then 
death. There is, as of yet, no 
known cure. 

So if in the next five years, 
thousands of British people start 
dying from vCJD, then we know 
it's 60ing to be our rum in anoth-
er five. So far it doesn't look too 
bleak. The number of vCJD fatal-
ities in Britain has been steadily 
rising in the last few years, but 
nowhere near the rate that was 
feared when the mad cow scare 
first began in Britain. vCJD fatali-
ties continue to be fewer than 100 
in a year. Given the total popula-
tion of Britain, there seems to be 
little cauSe for alarm. 

Unfortunately, chances are that 
our cattle industry is infected, and 
to an undetermined extent as the 
cattle industry continues to resist 
increased testing of livestock. 
What malees the spread of BSE so 
insidious is that modem farming 
practices virtually guarantee if 
there is one infected cow, there 
will be hundreds more. The key 
problem is the limited enforce-
ment of the ruminant feed ban. 
Ruminant feeding is the practice 
of processing cattle remains to be 
included in the cattle feed, in 
order to give the cows an addi-
tional source of protein. Besides 
the ethical malaise that might be 
felt when considering the action 
of feeding cows to other cows, this 
practice was the reason wby BSE 

FEB. 12 

was able to spread to almost one-
third of British cattle before it was 
checked. The cattle remains that 
are fed back to healthy cows are 
often "downer" cows, cows too 
sick to be able to walk, and prime 
suspects as hosts of BSE. 
Furthermore, the two most infec-
tious parts of the cow, the brain 
and the spinal col~ are usually 
processed in this manner. 

There is no easy way to steril-
ize the meat, because the most 
likely infection vector of BSE are 
prions, protein strands smaller 
than viruses that are extremely 
resilient. Laboratory tests have 
confirmed that prions are largely 
immune to available sterilization 
techniques, including high heat 
and radiation. The only existing 
chemicals that do destroy them 
would also render the meat inedi-
ble. 

BSE generally takes two to 
eight years for symptoms to man-
ifest themselves in cattle. 
However, the average lifespan of 
the meat-producing cow is four to 
five years. This makes it a very 
realistic possibility that an uniden-
tified number of infected cows 
have been slaughtered and eaten 
before their symptoms began to 
manifest. Case in point, the one 
cow that has been confirmed to 
have BSE in the United States: It 
had not manifested symptoms of 
BSE and it had only been tested 
because it had suffered an injury 
during calling, not because it had 
been suspected of BSE. 

This leads us to the inadequate 
testing practices of the U.S. cattle 
industry. Even after the discovery 
of the infected cow, only "downer" 
cows are tested for BSE. In the 
case of the infected cow, it had 
already been butchered and pack-
aged off to a number of states 
before lab results reported that it 
was infected. 

An enormous recall of meat 
had to be initiated because it was 
difficult to determine exacdy 
where the infected beef had been 
shipped. In Britain, one in four 
cows are tested for BSE. InJapan, 
every cow slated for human con-
sumption is tested. In the United 
States, where 35 million cows are 
slaughtered each year, only 
S7,000 "downer" cows are tested. 
Given the information about the 

long incubation time of BSE, 
testing only "downer" cows is 
clearly inadequate. The testing 
program needs to be expanded 
and meat tracking needs to be 
improved so that we are better 
able to stop shipment of infected 
beef. 

The Food and Drug 
Administration needs to properly 
enforce the ruminant feed ban. 
According to the FDA, of the 
companies that handle the pro-
cessing of cattle feed, "99 percent 
of these finDs are in substantial 
compliance. " 

According to a report from the 
U .S. General Accounting Office, 
the "FD~ data on inspections are 
severely flawed, and as a result, 
FDA does not mow the full extent 
of industry compliance." 
According to an even more recent 
report from Japan's agricultural 
ministry, U.S. safety standards are 
not sufficient to rule out further 
cases of BSE. 

To date, the FDA has not initi-
ated any punitive measures against 
noncomplying firms other than 
letters of protest. Stronger puni-
tive measures, such as substantial 
fines, should be considered to give 
an added incentive for firms to 
comply with the ruminant feed 
ban. 

It is perhaps shortsighted for 
the cattle industry to resist 
chanres to reduce the risk of BSE. 
Besides the ethical imperative to 
prevent their customers from 
dying, it is to the financial benefit 
of the companies to comply with 
new regulations. While the cost of 
switching away from ruminant 

. feed systems and increased testing 
has been estimated at over S300 
million per year, the loss of rev-
enue from halted, exports far out-
weighs this amount. Out of the S4 
billion-per-year cattle industry, 10 
percent of the output is exported. 
Also, a widespread scare could 
cause the market to collapse, 
which would certainly cause more 
loss of profits than the added cost 
of testing and new feeding proce-
dures. 

But the issue is less one of cost 
and more of protection. 
Unfortunately, it. seems that the 
time for preventative protection is 
past, while the time for watching 
and waiting is here.

Primaries: Plans for 
higher education debated 

continued from pace I 
has a different higher education plat-
form, most with the goals of opening 
the doors to higher education and 
make college more affordable. 

Fmr. Vermont Gov. Howard 
Dean's "College Commitment" 
would seek to grant $10,000 a year 
in loans for each student's post-sec-
ondary education. 

Students, according to Dean's 
plan, would never have to pay more 
than 10 percent of their income 
after college on student payments, 
and if they are working and paying 
loans for 10 years, the remainder 
will be paid for them. 

"We all understand the critical 
importance of higher education," 
said Dean in a speech to Dartmouth 
College students on Nov. 13,2003. 
"It leads to good jobs and individual 
success, an educated workforce and 
a strong middle class. [StlJdentsl 
need to mow that the door to col-
lege is open to them. All they need 
to do is work hard and plan ahead 
and the path will be there." 

Some, however, see problems in 
getting such a plan to work. 

"Money automatically taken out 
of their incomes, that's a problem I 
see," College Republicans Vice 
Chair Internal Adam Richards said. 
"That can really hurt people down 
the road, and I'm not confident . 

" 

UCSD political science professor 
Gary Jacobson. "Especially in 
California, I se~ college becoming 
less and less free. Where will the 
money come from for such plans? 
What incentives do students have 
to finish their college education if 
it's free? It's very easy for candi-
dates to taJk because they don't 
have to face the reality of paying 
for it yet." 

Kerry's college platform fea-
tures student grants in the form of 
tax credits. Kerry's "College 
Opportunity Tax Credit" would 
provide a credit for up to S4,000 on 
each year of college that brealcs 
down as 100 percent of the fint 
SI,OOO and 50 percent of every 
$1,000 afterwards for the duration 
of a student's college career. 

"We have two main goals, " 
UCSD's Students for Kerry cam-
paign volunteer and Eleanor 
Roosevelt College senior Mara Lee 
said. "The first is to provide incen-
tives for people to attend college, 
and the second is a policy of reten-
tion: to keep students in school and 
to graduate them." 

Some hope that the democratic 
candidates would put more funds 
into higher education than the 
Bush administration has. 

"We're not seeing those promises 
made three years ago," said UCSD's 

Students for Dean 
. that students will 
want to do that. 
There are better 
pay plans than that 
out there." 

Other tandi-
dates, such as Sen. 
John Edwards (D 
- N.C.) and Gen. 
Wesley Clark, have 
different schemes 
for making higher 
education more 
affordable. 

We're not seeing 
those promises made 

communications 
director and J obo 
Muir College junior 
Jeremy Cogan. "We 
want to have ambi-
tious goals for high-
er education, qua1ity 
and progress. But it 
takes funds. You 
can't promise to 
improve a system 
while cutting funds 
from it, and that's 

~l_ II wee years ago. 

~~ 
SIudenls far Dean 

Edwards' 
"College for 
Everyone" program would provide 
one year of free tuition at public 
univenities and community col-
leges for every student. In return, 
students would be required to work 
or serve their communities for an 
average of 10 hours each week. 

Clark wants to make the first 
two years of college free for "most 
students" by creating a Universal 
College Grant of $6,000 per year 
for the first two yean of any public 
or private univenity. Clark hopes 
to pay for more than half of the 
cost of this grant by consolidating 
the Pell Grant and the Hope 
Scholarship and increasing compe-
tition for student loans byeliminat-
ing billions of dollars per year in 
subsidies that the government pays 
to banks that offer student loans. 

"I pledge to you that by the end 
of my first term in office, one mil-
lion additional students will gain 
access to higher education," said 
Clark in a speech to high school 
students in New Hampshire on 
Dec. 10,2003. "Enrolling one mil-
lion more Americans in college is 
an ambitious goal. But I believe 
leaders need to set ambitious goals 
and work hard to achieve them." 

Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D - OH) 
plans to go even further by provid-
ing tuition-free higher education to 
millions of students in state univer-
sities. 

"You want to stimulate the econ-
omy? Give everyone a chance to go 
to college, for free," said Kucinich 
in an interview with the Daily 
Californian dated Nov. 2, 2003 . 
"That will stimulate the economy. 
That will set off a boom in educa-
tion in this country that will enable 
people to get better educated and 
therefore be able to have the kind of 
options where they can go into a 
career that they wouldn't have been 
able to afford before." 

However, some political experts 
meet plans such as Kucinich's with 
skepticism. 

"I highly doubt that such plans 
would pass in the legislature," said 

what President Bush 
did." 

Most of the candidates have 
come out in favor of service for col-

. lege systems such as ROTC and 
AmeriCorps, where students can 
pay for their college education 
through service in the armed forces 
or in the community. 

Dean intends to provide funher 
student loan relief for those who 
enter a career in public services such 
as nursing, teaching, law enforce-
ment and firefighting in the form of 
a 7 percent yearly payback plan 
instead of the normal 10 percent. 

"The basic Dean philosophy is 
to see more public service corps, 
especially those devoted to public 
sa fety and national service such as 
firefighters and the National 
Guard," said Cogan. "Two things 
we desire: one, to increase our sup-
ply of desperately needed public 
servants; and two, to help people 
with their education by serving in 
the community and getting a good 
education at the same time." 

Edwards' program is mainly cen-
tered on community service as a 
means to pay back student loans, and 
Kerry's "Service for College" initia-
tive would offer students the chance 
to earn the equivalent of their state's 
four-year public' college tuition in 
exchange for two years of service. 

Most of the funds the candidates 
need for their education proposals 
would come from a repealing of tax 
cuts under the Bush administration. 

"I think that to a certain degree 
some of them should be repealed, 
especially the ones that benefit the 
wealthy," Lee .said. "I think that it's 
more important to educate a gener-
ation than have a wealthier top 10 
percent." . 

Some disagree, saying the tax 
cuts have helped the economy. 

"Not just the wealthy benefit 
from this tax cut, " Richards said. 

With the anticipated New 
Hampshire primary coming up on 
Jan. 27, the candidates may expand 
on their higher education plat-
forms to sway undecided coJlege-
age voten.

Jazz chanteuse Lizz Wrigtit channels classics at Mandeville 
Singer/songwriter specializes in sultry jazz 
lyANN SHEN 

Staff Writer 

If you're looking for the glam-
our and gloss of the 1920s jazz era 
of night clubs and dry martinis, let 
Lizz Wright be your soundtrack. 
The 23-year-old soulful girl from 
rural Georgia made her highly 
acclaimed and widely praised debut 
on the legendary jazz label Verve 
early last spring and will be per-
fonning at Mandeville Auditoriwn 
on Jan. 22. 

With a collection of cover songs 
and her own collaborated works 
with pianist Kenny Banks, Wright 
showcases her voice on Salt 
through well-known hymns ("Walk 
With Me, Lordj, Broadway show 
tunes ("Soon as I Get Home" from 
"The Wiz") and classic jazz num-
bers from well-established singers 
("Open Your Eyes, You Can Fly" 
originally performed by Flora 
Purim). Unlike most fans, Wright 
had the chance to remake each of 
her favorite songs into her own 
translation. 

"I have to be able to Live with 
songs, I live with things I write; I 
live with things I cover. There's no 

Concert 
PREVI 

reason why I can't identify with 
someone else's experience. I'll lis-
ten to it over and over again and I'll 
just see if my life says it bacle. to 
me," Wright said of her album 
track selection. 

Born and raised in Hahira, Ga., 
as the youngest of three children 
with a father who was a minister 
and a mother who sang gospel at 
church services, Wright was sur-
rounded by music, spirit and 
rhythm. Performing in church with 
her siblings since the age of six, 
Wright lived and breathed gospel 
music when she wasn't doing 
homework or chores. 

After having won several 
regional, state and national 
medals as a teenager in duet and 
quartet groups, Wright was intro-
duced on Marian McPartland's 
National Public Radio jazz ~o­
gram. 

Lizz attended Georgia State 
University in Atlanta for one year, 

majoring in music perfonnance. 
She quickly dropped out of the 
classical-based program to pursue 
her dreams of singing with jazz 
combos in dark, musty jazz clubs. 
When she relocated 200 miles 
south to Macon, Ga. Wright was 
independent for the first time in 
her life. While discovering the real-
ities of independence, working to 
support living by herself, Wright 
also discovered the true nature of 
her voice and passion. She would 
drive two hours several times a 
week back to Atlanta "just to sit 
down and hear some jazz." Shortly 
afterwards, she joined jam sessions 
and was iq,vited to join the Atlanta 
band In the Spirit at Churchill 
Groands. Wright and the group 
garnered praise from jazz critics in 
the South and gained popularity in 
Atlanta. 

Soon, producer Tommy 
LiPuma caught sight of Wright's 
enormous talent and introduced 
her to a new combination of musi-
cians and collaborators, including 
kindted spirit, album drummer and 
co-producer Brian Blade, pianist 
and co-producer Jon Cowherd and 
piani.t and collaborator Banks. The 

CouIIIsr of I!IiIM baInIs

musical ensemble fully supports 
Wright's fledgling exploration of 
vocals and soul on SMt, creating 
depth to compliment her triple-
layer fudge cake voice. 

Along with exploring her vocals, 
the charming chanteuse also 
explores her songwriting skills, 
explicating in detail her feelings 
with her newfound success and her 
wide-eyed country girl-in-the-big-

city transition. With a critically cel-
ebrated debut into the modem jazz 
world, Wright is on a steady road 
to a career with respectable staying 
power.

'Butterfly Effect' delivers 
satisfying beginn'ing, end 
Kutcher is clueless, but Smart 
scores in uneven new thriller 
By AND. Idos IOWNGEI 

Staff Writer 

"1 h~ Butter.fly Eff~ct" ~eals 
WIth an Interestmg Idea, 
that of chaos theory -
that the batting of a but-

terfly's wings can eventually cause 
a hurricane. Putting that theory to 
test, Evan Treborn (Ashton 
Kutcher) goes back in time to 
enter his childhood body and 
change his life and the lives of 
everyone around him. The film 
has a good start, but it fails to ful-
fill its potential mainly because of 
poor directing and acting. 

Evan struggles with a mental 
disorder passed on to him by his 
insane father. He grows up repress-
ing moments of his childhood and 
college years, and discovers how to 
travel back in time to relive those 
moments with his childhood friends 
who include Keyleigh (Amy Sman), 
Tommy (W'tlliam Lee Scott) and 
Lenny (Elden Henson). All of these 
friends are related to his blacked out 
memories. As Evan realizes what . 
happens during his blackouts, he 
tries to change the traumatic events 
in his past and present. 

The storyline and the unfolding 
of the plot are good, but the logic 

and drama are lost as the film goes 
on. The first 45 minutes are incred-
ibly intriguing, but the movie loses 
its hold and never really regains it 
again until the very end. 

For directorsJ. Mackye Gruber 
and Eric Bress ("Final Destination 
2"), this is probably their best 
work. However, that's not saying 
much. The directors are inconsis~ 
tent with the overall theme of the 
movie. At times, they 'do a won-
derful job of showing the dark 
traumatic side of Evan's life, but at 
others, they seem stuck in teen-
horror-flick land. 

Kutcher, who is difficult to see 
in a serious role after "Dude, 
Where's My Car," does not have a 
strong grasp of his character and 
his performance is seriously want-
ing. Smart, who delivers a very 
fine performance, outshines him 
considerably. Kutcher has poten-
tial talent; there are a few 
moments when you almost b::lieve 
him, but he still remains unbeliev-
able. 

In the end, the film does man-
age to satisfy the audience and 
doesn 't leave them hanging.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS 9 

'Tad Hamilton' is a shallow snoozefest 
Pretty young actors play superficial duds 

By NEM SINGH 
Staff Writer 

Innocent giggles. Sheltered views. A complete faith in men. What comes to mind? If you're 
thinking of teenage girls, you're 
wrong. Welcome to the life of 
Rosalee Futch (Kate Bosworth), a 
22-year-old cashier at a local gro-
cery store, the Piggly Wiggly, in a 
small town of West Virginia. In 
"Wm a Date with Tad Hamilton!" 
one sees Rosalee's romantic life 
revolve around a celebrity with 
whom she wins a date, and around 
a man she's known all her life who 
secretly loves her. Despite the fact 
that the plot is entirely pre-
dictable, it would have still been 
possible for the film to be enter-
taining. However, the lack of plot 
and character development kills 
any hopes one might have had and 
those two hours end up being·a 
waste of time. 

Director Robert Lukatic 
("Legally Blonde") creates 
Bosworth's look in the shadow of 
Reese Witherspoon's; the only 
difference is that Bosworth's char:-
acter is much, much more naive. 
She glides through the scenes 
with a perpetually wide-eyed 
look, placing infinite trust in any-
one who is kind to her. Her pining 
beSt friend, Pete (Top her Grace), 
is exactly how he should be - shy, 
good looking, the only one who 
really "understands" Rosalee, and 
filled with an immense love for 
her. Grace plays the part exquis-
itely; it is disappointing that the 
writers did not further develop his 
character beyond the cute boy 
next door. Josh Duhamel is Tad

Film 
REVIEW 

Hamilton, the amazingly sexy 
Hollywood star with an image 
problem. Enter Rosalee, and the 
drama that is the premise of the 
film begins. The slight problem is 
that the story never develops, and 
that the characters are explored 
on a strictly superficial basis. 
None of the individuals transcend 
their stereotypes, which leaves the 
viewer with a vague, unsatisfied 
feeling when the film is over. 

On a more positive note, the 
film will appeal to younger audi-
ences. The soundtrack is full of 
songs by fashionable artists like 
John Mayer and Liz Phair, giving 
"Tad Hamilton!" a very trendy, pop 
feel. Strictly from an aesthetic 
point of view, the movie makes the 

cut The sets perfectly portray what 
one might imagine Hollywood and 
a small hick town to look like. All 
the characters are very good-look-
ing, which is also a great ploy to 
attract viewers. Unfortunately, the 
lack of substance drags the entire 
6Im down. Overall, it is a good 
movie to go to if you are a teeny 
bopper or if you've been meaning 
to take your younger sibling out. If 
you don't fall in either of these cat-
egories, your time will be better 
spent taking a nap, since you'd 
probably end up having an expen-
sive one at this movie.

Orange County pop-punkers Limbeck have decided to dress up like Ryan Adams and 
take a stab at the alt-country genre. 
Their goal: write songs so catchy 
that you will be begging them to 
leave you alone. 

On their most recent effort Hi,

up wid. Ed Rose of the Get Up

the honesty of the Midwest.

that is less Gram Parsons than "0

Brett Sparks' booming baritone

Limbeck's first s9ng "Honk and

song on the entire album. 

As the tunes roll by, each song is 
a poorer imitation of the one pre-
ceding it. By the end, it's hard to 
believe that these guys have the 
balls to play another G-chord. 

Limbeck will be performing at

Some artislS can satisfy the desire for both hummable melodies and daring iMova-
tion (no, not X-Tina). The 
Unicorns' brilliant debut will tickle 
the fancy of any Flaming Lips fan. 

The album begins tellingly on a 
false stan of broken beats and scat-
tershot whisding. The melodies 
themselves are euphonious, but 
something's amiss in the world of 
the Unicorns. The harmonies lie 
too close together, no one ever hits 
the right note. and everything 
wavers uncontrollably. Guitars, 

AlienS 

***--synths and drums struggle to stay 
in sync. The songs come together 
by deliberately falling apan. 

As for the lyrics, the excc/lent 
"Tuff Ghost" contains the memo-
rably ridiculous line: "I lift weights 
but I don't sweat, I go for a swim 
but I don't get wet." All the irony 
and silliness wears thin after a 
while, but it's a treat when you're in 
the mood. The Unicorns could 
simply follow the rules of pop, but 
where would the fun be in that?

THURSDAY. JANUARY 22. 2004 TIlE UCSD OUARDIAN HIATUS II 

All award shows should change 
their name to 'The Crap Awards' 
short kids 
are cool es@ 

Deena AI Shatti 

I grew up overseas, meaning my exposure to American television was limited to what our current satellite provider decided to 
broadcast - anything from "Saved by the 
Bell" reruns to the latest season of "ER." 
The one thing that remained constant, how-
ever, were live broadcaslS of different awards 
shows: the Oscars. the Grammy's, etc. Due 
to the time difference, the live broadcasts 
were shown at odd hours - I'm talking 2 
a.m., 3 a.m. I used to record these award 
shows overnight and eagerly watch them the 
next morning. 

But, things have changed. Lately, it seems 
that there are more award shows than there 
are actors in Hollywood. And, just like most 
of the actors in Hollywood, all of the award 
shows are crap. 

The other week, I had the pleasure of 
watching the so-called "People's Choice 
Awards." put on by CBS, featuring a multi-
tude of CBS-owned nominees · and others. 
The show was a joke. The nominees were 
even worse. Hosted by Charlie Sheen and 
Jon Cryer (stars of CBS's upcoming comedy 
"Two and a Half Men!" Yay product place-
ment!), the show featured the weirdest com-
bination of nominees you can imagine. First 
of all, there were only three nominees in' 
each category, leaving many television 
shows, ·movies and musical acts out of the 
picture. Secondly, the mixture of nominees 
was just strange. 

I'D give you an example: Favorite Male 
Artist. Any other time, these nominees 
would be broken down into genres. 
"Favorite Male R&B Artist." "Favorite Male 
Country Artist." Ah, but not the People's 
Choice Awards! They seemed to think that 
breaking things down was a bad idea. "Not 
to worry," I thought. "Maybe their choices 
will be some of the top artislS in the musical 
field today." Not quite. Favorite Male Artist 
nominees were 50 Cent, Tun McGraw and 
Eminem. I have to ask, on what universe is it 
oleay to mix rap and country music for 
favorite male artist? Meanwhile, in the 
Favorite Band category, the nominees were 

Alabama, Brooks & Dunn and MatchboI 20. 
Who came up with these nominees? They 
should be shot. 

Lately, award shows seem to simply be a 
way for already overexposed celebrities and 
famewhores (Sharon Stone, I'm looking at 
you) to show off their latest fashion-don'ts 
(paging Lara Flynn Boyle!) in a stupendous 
mix of booze, shit nominees and even shitti-
er live acts. Just invi te them all to the open-
ing of an envelope - we, the viewers would-
n't have to lose two and a half to three hours 
of our lives, and the celebrities would be 
happy being their badly-dressed, famewhor-
ish selves. 

The winner for the most obnoxious show 
of the year must be VHl's Big in 2003 
awards, where Kim Jong II (the leader of 
North Korea) was nominated for best brealc-
through act. It takes something special to 
nominate someone like that in a category 
like that, but I guess VII 1 had the NUs to do 
so. The show was the biggest waste of three 
hours that I have ever had the misfortune of 
sitting through, minus the time my cousin 
dragged me to see "From Justin 2 Kelly." 

Meanwhile, the winner for the most 
nominated show would have to be 
"Everybody Loves Raymond." Award shows 
seem to thrive on nominating the same 
actor/television show over and over again. 
The worst offense comes from the 2004 
Screen Actors Guild awards, which nominat-
ed all three of the males on that show in the 
past year alone. Why? The show really isn't 
that fantastic! Stop nominating people who 
don't deserve it! 

I know I'm an idiot for sitting through 
these over and over again, but each time I 
hear of one, I hope there's a chance that 
someone decent will either be nominated or 
wiD. Sadly, that never happens. Besides, it's 
always fun watching celebrities and their 
horrendous outfilS parade around the red 
carpet. And as for the Oscars, who doesn't 
love to watch Joan Rivers get name after 
name wrong during the pre-show? 

If you're in the mood for self-torture, 
however, be on the look out because there 
are many award shows for you to watch in 
the coming year. The Golden Globes are on 
later this month, with the Grammy's and the 
Oscars coming up quickly in February. But 
keep your eyes and ears open for some of the 
lesser shows. After all, you never know when 
"The Cat in the Hat" will be nominated for 
Best Comedy.

Recruits look to help Tritons achieve goals 
Women's crew eyes national champions this year 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's crew 
team aims to begin its new season 
with reinvigorating energy and 
athletic confidence, supplied by a 
considerable number of fresh 
recruits balanced by a substantial 
cadre of four-year returners, head 
coach Patti Pinkerton said. 

"We feel confident we will get 
to nationals this year, and we are 
very excited about it," Pinkerton 
said. 
. The Tritons have feverishly 
practiced to start their season with 
steadily solid perfonnances, since 
the team has set goals and is intent 
on dominating its rivals this year 
with a stronger and varied team. 

"Overall the strength of the 
team is much greater this year, 
both in physical strength and the 
bond within the team, " senior 
rower Jen Watters said. 

Although the team finished as 
the fourth-fastest Division IT crew 
in the nation, it finished last sea-
son ranked sixth in the NCAA 
polls, in which the Western region 
was cited as a particularly fast and 
strong region to compete in. 

"We missed out on national 
selection because the top four 
crews came from the West [No. I 
UC Davis, No. 2 Western 
Washington, No. 3 Humboldt 
State and No. 4 UCSD) . Our goal 
is to finish in the top two this year 
in our region, which would put us 
in the medal spot at nationals," 
Pinkerton said. 

The team has goals set on mak-
ing it to the national champi-
onships by the end of May and 
wants to improve upon their 
record. 

"Last year in the season we 
were off and on, but this year we 
expect a consistent, strong perfor-
mance," Watters said. 

The Tritons have a number of 
key opponents they plan on over-
powering, including arch-rival 
Western Washington. 

"Humboldt State has always 
been a rival in the lightweight and 
open categories, so they would be 

" This is the strongest team 
we've fielded in my 

tenure, and our juniors 
will also be providing 

leadership. AU are 
medalists from our league 

championships and the 
seniors won a bronze 
medal at the NCAA 
Qualifier last May. " 
- Patti PiI*eItDn. UCSD 

women's aew head COICh 

our nearest rivals. UC Davis has 
always been a rival, but with their 
move to Division I, it becomes less 
of a concern . Western 
Washington from the Northwest 
is now the team to beat," 
Pinkerton said. 

The exceptionally diverse 
strength will be complemented by 
five four-year returning athletes 
instrumental to the team's dreams 

of making it to nationals later this 
year. These members include 
junior coxswain Claire 
Rommelfanger, juniors Alexis 
Kleckner and Stefanie Barric;re, 
lightweight junior co-captain Liz 
Jones and Watters. 

"This is the strongest team 
we've fielded in my tenure, and 
our juniors will also be providing 
leadership," Pinkerton said. "All 
are medalists from our league 
championships and the seniors 
won a bronze medal at the NCAA 
Qualifier last May. " 

Further supplementing the 
team is a large number of new 
recruits, untested rookies who will 
likely serve the t.earn well in its 
quest for a chance to compete at 
nationals. 

"We have a larger number of 
recruits this year than in previous 
years. A few of them arc very 
strong lightweights - we should 
have a very strong lightweight 
team this year, " Watters said. 

As the season begins, the tearn 
has been put to the test with an 
intensive, early-morning practice 
schedule. 

"We have been focusing more 
on erging Oand training) to help 
overcome mental barriers that 
have previously hindered our per-
fonnance," Watters said. 

Despite the contrast b.!tween 
the seasoned four-year returners 
and unsullied rookies, the team 
expects a high level of bonding to 
occur over the course of the com-
ing season. 

"The team is really close and 
supportive this year, which we 
believe will really help us get to 
nationals this year," Watters said. 

Their first competiton of the 
season is on Feb. 28 at UC Irvine.

Sanders has implemented a new 
driver-oriented offense that will 
focus on the importance of individ-
ual roles because of the team's 
depth. The speed of drivers Jackson 
and Wong will be utilized more 

efficiendy on fast breaks and coun-
ters, eliminating the lost time used 
to set up a two-meter oriented 
offense. Instead of having to sit and 
pass until an opportunity opens up 
at two meters, K1eidon, Clevenger 
and others will drive hard and often

roster should be able to contend for the national championship. 

to move defenders around and cre-
ate opportunity around the pool. 

"This offense gets the players to 
think, 'How am I going to be draw-
ing, moving, creating?'" Sanders 
said. "With speed and the counter, 
we'll be a much more active team." 

The pillar of UCSD women's 
water polo that has remained 
intact is a quick, relendess man 
defense that, according to 
Sanders, "will win big games" for 
his squad. It will keep opposing 
shots out of the net and the pres-
sure off of the young Triton 
offense to get the tying goal. 

Team captain Bantilan-Smith 
will be the defensive Iynchpin and 
rely on experience and speed, 
which has proven essential to the 
UCSD counterattack in the past. 

Despite the current concerns 
of team chemistry, a strong non-
league schedule will aid the transi-
tion of seven individual talents 
into one coherent mode of play. 
The tough non-conference sched-
ule begins this weekend at the 
Michigan Kick-off Tournament in 
Ann Arbor, Mich., where UCSD 
will face Michigan, Marist (N.Y.), 
Indiana and Ariwna State. 

"Each player has room to 
develop as the season goes along, 
and by getting each other to work 
hard and want [0 win, they'll be in 
a better position to win some 
games," Sanders said. 

And it might even give the 
team a chance to "Play in May." 

Softball ready to lead 
off 2004 season 

Guallfanfie 
Without • Qfd: Injuries and and a crop of new players have kept UCSD head 
coach Patti Geraens from setting an opening day lineup. 

ByIOE SPANO 
Staff Writer 

UCSD's 2004 softball season 
begins Jan. 31, and in spite of the 
loss of a graduated senior and a 
couple nonreturners, the team is 
ready and waiting. 

"We stuted practicing on Jan. 
5, and we've been practicing very 
hard," Triton head coach Patti 
Gerckens said. "The girls are stut-
ing to get to know each other, and 
even though we're a ways ftom 
where w,' need to be, we're right 
on track to get there." 

Former catcher Kristin 
Hunstad, who graduated last year, 
will be missed behind the plate, but 
last year's first baseman, junior 

Jamie Hurst, will take over 
Hunstad's duties . 

The Tritons' pitching staff 
includes returning senior Jodie 
Bland, freshman TIna Rowe and 
transfer student Kelley Bryant. 

The remaining positions are not 
yet solidified due to injuries and a 
need to wait and see how the new 
players develop. 

"We're very optimistic about 
this year; the girls can't wait for the 
season to stut," Gcrckens said. 

UCSD will open the season with 
the longest homestand that the team 
will play all year. The Tritons will 
play their first eight games at Triton 
Softball Stadium, starting off with a 
game against California Baptist on 
Jan. 31 at noon. 

Track: Hernandez returns to 
lead team in shot .. put 

continued from page 16 
Callister should be some of our 
top placers in the distances," 
Salerno said. 

The women's side has top 
returning athletes to help fuel their 
team. 

"Our top returning athlete is 
senior shot/hammer thrower 
Sagrario Hernandez. She is the 
top returning shot-putter in 
Division II and is a three-time 
All-American for us," Salerno 
said. 

Hernandez, a distinguished and 
critical centerpiece, has always 
been intent on challenging herself 
and in focusing the team on con-
tending against the most formida-
ble foes. 

Several other competitors are 
expected to bring out the best in 
their events, particularly in the 
hurdles. 

"Hurdler Mikey Cunningham 
had a great freshman year last year, 
including a school record and an 
NCAA national qualifying mark," 
Salerno said. 

Returning sophomore short 
sprinters CJ Lawrence and Peiman 
Lahsaei and seasoned sophomore 
long sprinter Matt Horner are 
looking to be standouts on an 
exceptionally well-developed 
squad. 

Great depth and talent are also 

evident in the composition of the 
discus and pole vault events. 

"Senior discus thrower Abel 
Aramburo is on his way to a great 
season after reaching an NCAA 
qualifying mark last year," Salerno 
said. "Senior Pat Ruttinger has a 
very good chance of qualifying for 
nationals [in the pole vault), and a 
very talented young sprint squad 
last year will only be ' better this 
year." 

A number of fresh recruits 
show promise in culling strong 
scores for the Tritons, and will 
also help spice up each team's per-
fonnance. 

Freshmen sprinters Elisa 
Holiday and Alex Hesselgesser and 
junior transfer Kevin Beeman will 
all add to the progression of each 
their respective track squads. 

"We always keep our eyes on 
CCAA Championships in May. We 
have been [working toward cham-
pionships) since October, SO it is 
pretty exciting to actually have 
some competition on the horizon," 
Salerno said. 

The first meet of several in the 
upcoming season will be the UC 
San Diego Blue-Gold Alumni 
Meet, held on Feb. 14 at 10 a.m. at 
UCSD. The Tritons' first regular 
season meet is the Pomona-Pitzer 
All-Comers meet on Feb. 21 in 
Claremont, Calif.

UCSD welcomes new crew coach 

Davis has men's crew team ready to row 
By MAl'THEW GIANI' 

Staff Writer 
The Triton men's crew team 

shows promise for the 2004 sea-
son, boasting a roster large 
enough for two varsity boats and a 
novice boat full of both veteran 
and fresh talen t. 

"We're happy to have two 
varsity eights [boats] this year 
with two or three freshmen row-
ing in them," senior team captain 
Clint Wayland said. "We were 
lucky to get a lot of good 
recruits." 

The first test of the team's 
strength will be on Feb. 28 at 
Newport Harbor in a dual meet 
with UC Irvine, but the Tritons 
arc keeping the elltire season in 
mind as they train with still more 
than a month to go until the open-
er. 

First-year head coach Mark 
Davis is helping the squad prepare 
for a successful season from the 
start. 

"The team has a series of goals 
that they have developed as a ' 
team," Davis said. "First, to win 
the City Championship." 

The April 18 City 
Championship regatta features 
UCSD, San Diego State and 
University' of San Diego boau 

racing in Mission Bay. In the 
past, San Diego State has had 
consistently powerful boats at 
the event, but recent problems 
within the organization have 
stunted the power of their varsi-
ty eight. 

"The next goal is to make it to 
the grand finals in the San Diego 
Crew Classic," Davis said. 

The two-day Crew Classic 
will be held on Apr. 3 and Apr. 4 
in Mission Bay and holds some 
fierce competition for UCSD. 

"The Crew Classic is one of 
the biggest regattas in the coun-
try," Wayland said. "It features 
300 boats from some of the best 
rowing schools racing over two 
days." 

Achieving the team goal of 
grand finals at the two-day event 
may be the single greatest chal-
lenge for this team. The grand 
final is the final heat of the regat-
ta in which the top sill boats in a 
field of 21 advance to compete for 
the tide. 

"The last team goal for the sea-
son is to medal at the conference 
championships," Davis said. 

At the Western Intercollegiate 
Rowing Association 
Championships on May 1 and 
May 2, UCSD will be hunting 
the UC Davis team, which won 

last year's WIRA event. Other 
competition at the regatta will 
include Orange Coast College 
and local rivals SDSU and USD. 

"I think last year we finished 
10th at WlRA in a field of 18 or 
20," Davis said. 

In addition to the three "out-
come" goals, the team has devel-
oped six goals to maintain 
throughout the season, all which 
contribute to solid preparation 
needed for developing endurance 
for the upcoming season. 

The team is anxious for the 
return of Eric Hardeman, who 
was injured for most of last sea-
son. 

"He's really turned around and 
spent time preparing over the off-
season," Wayland said. "He's 
doing well." 

Davis also noted the impor-
tance of leadership for his team 
this season. 

Coxswains sophomores 
Shannon Oliver and Zack 
Moseman will be guiding the 
Triton eights this spring. 

"I think it's especially impor-
tant to remember the coxswains in 
this spon, too," Davis said. "They 
are the ones responsible for moti-
vation, steering and basically mak-
ing sure that the boat doesn't 
crash." 

Baseball: Team adds key transfers to roster 
continued from page 16 

.323 in 2003 and led the team with 
62 hits, 12 doubles and 76 total 
bases. 

Sophomore Damian Fante is 
coming off a very strong freshman 
season. The outfielder stuted 40 
games in his rookie season as a 
Triton. He hit .286 on the season 
with seven doubles and recorded 
his first collegiate home run. 

With injuries to such key play-
ers, the Tritons needed to bring 
some veteran experience to the 
field. 

UCSD senior returning out-
fielders David Hawk and Bren 
Burton are both battling early sea-
son injuries. 

"The team added several key-
position player transfers, all of 
which will add to a strong defense 
and a solid offense," O'Brien said. 

Damian Fante

"The team has also added team

Craig King, a junior outfielder 
and team captain, is a transfer 
from the College of the Desert. 
He is projected to start in center 
field and lead off in the lineup. 

Junior first baseman Brian

Ricky Pinocchlo is a junior

vides us with a solid team this

Baseball returns 
young team in 2004 

By COURTNEY FIELD 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD baseball team 
lost nine seniors from the 2003 
squad, but the Tritons return for 
the 2004 season strong and pre-
pared to face the competition. 
The Tritons have returning key 
pitchers and added some impor-
tant veteran players to the posi-
tion core and pitching staff. 

Head coach Dan O'Brien 
believes that the Tritons' young 
but experienced pitching staff 
will be the key to the team's suc-
cess. 

"The staff has a combination 
of experience from both returners 
and transfers," O'Brien said. 
"Experience and maturity in the 
bullpen could turn out to be the 
team's most important piece of 
the puzzle. [We should] expect 
good things from this young core 
of pitchers for the next several 
years." 

T he top returning hurlers are 
expected to be starters and pitch 
in the rotation. Senior pitcher Raf 
Bergstrom is a three-year veteran 
and has developed into the team's 
ace pitcher. Bergstrom comes off 
of a strong 2003 season, pitching 
four complete games with a 4.20 
ERA and 5-2 record on the sea-
son. 

Sophomore pitcher Byron 
Grubman owns one of the best 
freshman pitching performances 
in the program's history. 
Grubman led last year's staff 
with a 7-2 record and finished 
the season with :l 3.95 ERA in 

73.2 innings pitched. Grubman 
was named to the All -West 
Region Second Team in his first 
year. 

Fellow sophomore pitcher 
Jose Navarro is a strong left-han-
der. As a starter last year, he had a 
very solid freshman year. Navarro 
went 3-6 on the season with a 
4.16 ERA in 75.2 innings pitched. 
He struck out a team-high 54 bat-
ters on the season and gave up 
just 21 walks. 

The Triton coaching staff is 
excited about the new talent of 
the pitching staff. Sophomore 
Ryan Leake transferred to UCSD 
this year from Div. I University of 
Nevada, Reno. Junior Justin 
Allred joined the Triton pitching 
staff from Div. 1 University of San 
Francisco, and junior Shlomo 
Lipitz is a local transfer from 
Mesa Community College. 

The Tritons also return strong 
position players. Senior team cap-
tain Jeff Riddle returns for his 
final season as a Triton. Riddle, a 
three-year starter, plays catcher 
and first base for UCSD. He had 
a .993 fielding percentage and 
'team-high 247 putouts. Batting 
fourth in the lineup, Riddle hit 
.301 on the season and led the 
team with a .479 slugging per-
centage, 43 RBIs and five home 
runs. 

Junior shortstop Keith 
Hernandez is a two-year starting 
shortstop, and is projected to hit 
in the middle of the lineup. 
Hernandez, a team captain, hit

Women's water polo will 
take on new offensive style 

By DANIEL DIAl 
Staff Writer 

2004 marks a transition for 
UCSD women's water polo, from 
the familiarity of last year's core 
of seniors to the emergence of a 
young squad strong in depth but 
hounded by questions concerning 
experience and team chemistry. 

Still, when the Tritons jump 
into the pool this season, the 

Baseball (25-28 last year) 

word "rebuilding" will be the far-
thest thing from their minds. 
They'll be playing for the pre-
sent, giving their all to play at the 
national championships held in 
May. 

"Let's 'Play in May,'" head 
coach Larry Sanders said. "This 
team is young, but we are still 
certainly shooting to play at the

UCSD will 
face tough 
competition 
on the track 
Track and field 

anticipates a 
strong year 

after average 
play last season 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's and women's 
track and field teams plan to race to 
victory in 2004, leaving many chal-
lenging competitors in the dust, 
just as it has in the past few years. 

Both teams got strength 
through a successful recruiting 
drive that revitalized the UCSD 
men's and women's track teams, 
and despite a few key losses to 
graduation, the season's prospects 
look bright. 

Expectations have been raised 
because UC Davis was moved to 
Division I, a school that n histor-
ically the obstacle to UCSD's plans 
for regional domination and a 
chance at nationals. 

"UC Davis has moved to 
Division I now, so a win is the 
objective on the women's side in 

particul~. Our conference is the 
strongest in Division n track and 
field, however, so we will have to 
see what the other schools have this 
year, " head coach Tony Salerno 
said. 

Both squads had a difficult time 
at the conference championship 
meet last year, but Salerno fore-
casts top three finishes for both 
teams this season. 

Last year, the women's team 
finished the season ranked sec-
ond, while the men placed 16th in 
the national power rankings. In 
2002, the women's team was nar-
rowly beaten by UC Davis, but 
retained its superiority by finish-
ing ahead of Chico State. 

Both men's and women's teams 
have a keen eye focused on a vari-
ety of opponents, including tradi-
tional archrival Chico State. 

"Cruco is the team to beat on 
the men's side in our conference as 
I stated above, but UCSB, UCI and 
Davis are teams we consider rivals 
every bit as much as our Division n 
conference opponents," Salerno 
said. 

Both squads are intent on best-
ing UCSD's sister schools, includ-
ing UC Irvine and UC Santa 
Barbara. 

"We actually compete against 
Irvine and Santa Barbara more 
often than our Division n confer-
ence schools. We actually expect to 
see more of Davis now that they 
are a Division I program than we 
did when they were in our confer-
ence," Salerno said. 

Although a few outstanding 
track athletes were lost to gradua-
tion last year, such as distance 
superstar All-American Audrey 
Sung, many veteran standouts 
remain to complement the relative-
ly young squads. Roughly 30 ath-
letes are returning to support each 
respective team. 

"On the men's side, seniors
