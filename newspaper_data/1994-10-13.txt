Attendance Drops at New 
Scripps AquariUID-MuseulD 
DECUNE: Facility turns to 
other funding sources to 
compensate for loss of income

Senior Staff Writer 

Despite a nearly 10 percent decline in atten-
dance over the past year, the Stephen Birch 
Aquarium-Museum has maintained its projected 
income goals, according to Aquarium Director 
Ruth Shelley. 

The S14 million Aquarium-Museum, located 

at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, opened 
its doors in September of 1992. During its first 
year of operation, 507,000 visitors paid to tour 
the aquarium. 

However, last year's attendance dropped to 
415,000, forcing aquarium administrators to 
find other sources of income. 

"We are not supported with taxes or public 
monies and over 60 percent of our operating 
revenue comes from admissions," Shelley said. 
, The aquarium is increasingly relying on such 
revenue sources as its membership program,

Biologists 
Find Key 
To Bones 
OSTEOPEROSIS: Trace 
minerals increase bone mass in 
post-menopausal women 
By Mery Beth SedlllCk 
Staff Writer 

Milk alone may not provide adequate nutri· 
tion for the bones of some women, according to 
a recent study which found that dietary supple-
ments of trace minerals in addition to calcium 
increased the strength and density of bones in 

-menopausal women. 
The study, which was published in the July 

issue oftheJournal ofNulrilion, was headed by 
UCSD Biology Professor Paul Sail man. 

According to Sallman, the study, in 
conjuction with his previous research, suggest 
that calcium and trace minerals such as manga-
nese, zinc and copper can alleviate osteoporosis 
in some women. Osteoporosis, a disease which 
is characterized by bone fragility , affects ap-
proximately 25 million Americans. 

"This is the first time we have grown bone 
back nutritionally in post-menopausal women " 
Saltman said. "All the papers published before 
our study that used calcium supplements alone 
showed you can slow down bone loss, but there 
is still a loss. We increased bone mineral den-
sity." 

Volunteer post-menopausal women were 
separated into four treatment groups based on 
the nutritional supplement they were offered: 
calcium plus trace minerals; c:!lcium alone; trace 
minerals alone; and placebos. 

Study participants were given 1,000 milli-
gram doses of calcium in addition to a normal 
diet. 

The experiment was a double-blind control 
so neither resean:hers nor volunteers knew who 
was part of any particular category. 

"This is the only sensible, accurate and cer-
tain scientific methods to test the efficacy of a 
substance in a reaction," Saltman said. 

After two years, 59 of the origi nal113 women 
finished the study were scanned with a dual-
photon absorptiometer, an imaging device which 
measures the bone density Qf the mubar spine 
region. ' 

The scan revealed that the women who were 
given calcium plus trace minerals had approxi-
mately five percent more bone mass than women 
who were given the placebo and 1.5 percent 
more bone mass than at the beginning of the 
study. Previous studies have shown that an extra

New Stude.nt Regent Pessimistic About Futur~ Fees 
WOOTEN: VCR senior 
promises to be a 
'fighter'on board 
., .... , .. 
GuIItdIan Reporter 

As the ooly student representa-
tive on the UC Board of RegCDlI-
the perning body tbat determines 
everytbin, from student fees to the 
names of campus buildiDp - re-

cently appointed student regent 
Terrance Wooten expressed liule 
hope for an' end to upcoming fee 
increases. 

Wooten, who once jokingly said, 
"I can pray" to lower the perenial 
fee bikes, explained that he sees the 
UC fee hikes as inevitable. 

He suuested however, that 
smaller, inc:rementa.l increua might 
be preferable to a single, large in-
creue. "Molt of us are willinl to 

accept a 10 percent fee hike," he 
said 

"But looking at the budget," 
Wooten added, "if we only do 10 
percent, we would have to cut some-
where else and a lot of downsizing 
hu already taken place." 

Wooten still plans to be a strong 
advocate for students. "I consider 
myself a worker, a fighter of stu-
dents' rights, not a politician," 
Wooten said. 

Wooten is optimistic about his 
role on the board and said he does 
not foresee any problems working 
with the current board members and 
dealing with issues that arise. 

Regent members also seemed 
confident about Wooten's abilities. 
"It seemed like (Wooten] didn't have 
a real Itrolll personal agenda, but 
he bad a lood, very strong student 
agenda," said Meredith Khachigian,

Gu.miMI Reporter 

An estimated 1,000 UCSD stu-
dents are taking advantage of the 
College Club System this year, a 
free telephone information service 
which was implemented by the As-
sociated Students last November. 

80 percent of the campus being 
online," Lockwood said. "I really 
want the system to get up to 90 
percent when ita really going." 

College Club pro-
vides students with 
information about 
campus events, rec-

ernment services, as 
well as an voice mail 
service. 

Started by a group 
of UCSD alumni,

of the student body 
online last year. Ac-
cording to Commis-

Lockwood, who 
oversees the system's 
implementation on 
campus, CollegeQub 
is expanding its ser-

"One of the rea-

about College Club is 
because a lot of the 
services that we have 
right now weren ' t

year," Lockwood 
said.

REGENT: 
Wooten says UCSA 
should have funding

one of sevcn regent members on 
the selection committee. 

"He does his homework, he's 
weD prepared and·auious to par-
ticipate in the convenatioo, .. she 
said. 

Wooten said he hopes to build 
upon what his predecessor, Darby 
Ann Morrisroe, accomplished 

during Iter term on the board. "I 
want to cxtend resean:h ... and en-
hance relationships between thc 
board and studenta. .. But realisti-
cally, it'. bard for student regents to 
come in for a year and try to change 
the world." 

Wooten said he felt regent re-
form, which would make the UC 
regenta more accountable to the stu-
dents, is needed. "All you need to 
have is money to be selected .... You 
don't need to know about education. 
It worries me," said Wooten. 

Wooten's primary goal is to open 

The UCSD Guardiaa 

lines of communication between the 
Regents and students. "It is very im-
portant that (the Regents) get out and 
interact with studenlK," he said. To 
ICCOmplisb this, Wooten said he will 
uk the Regents to meet with UCSA 
representatives from all of the UC 
campuses. 

Wooten said he familiar with 
UCSA's methods and the issues 
which students face. When funding 
to the UCSA wu cut lut year, 
Wooten said that the UCSAfelthelp-
less, u if they had lost their voice. 
"We were actually making ground ... 

[and] finally getting some respect. 
Then they cut our funds. 

"We have the right to lobby for 
issues directly related to education 
[and] directly affecting the students. 
We should have the right to fight for 
our rights," Wooten said. 

Even though Wooten is a strong 
advocate of student issues, he said 
his position u regent demands that 
he be objective when analyzing is-
sues. Wooten said he has learned to 
look at an issue from both the stu-
dents' and the administration's per-
spective. 

NEWS 3 

Wooten's original involvement 
in student government rose from a 
spur-of-the-moment invitation to at-
tend a student summit in Sacra-
mento. 

According to Wooten, he origi-
nally applied for the position of re-
gent at the promoting of his friends. 
"Student Regent seemed unattain-
able ... I didn't think I would make 
it," he said. 

Wooten was chosen out of 42 
other applicants from all nine UC 
campuses to become the twentieth 
student regent.

Political Candidates 
Need to Grow Up 

There is nothing new about verbal mud-slinging among poli-
ticians. It's quite remarkable, however, that politicians constantly 
search for new ways to do it, and keep ending up with the same 
old "vote-for-me-because-I-didn't-do-what-my-opponent-did" 
strategy. 

The latest slew of television campaign commercials all seem 
to be the same, no matter who the advertisers are trying to 
degrade. 

One of the worst and most unoriginal commercials says, 
"[Dianne] Feinstein is a career politician who wiJI say or do 
anything to stay in office." 

Feinstein's opponent, Michael Huffington, will obviously say 
or do anything to get in office, since he spends more time making 
Feinstein look bad than making himself look good. 

All of this is reminiscent of small children who try to make 
themselves seem better than everyone around them by making 
fun of other children. 

However, when middle-aged political candidates use tactics 
they should have grown out of long ago, it's difficult to take any 
of them seriously. 

And, let's not forget the verbal tug-of-war between guberna-
torial candidates Pete Wilson and Kathleen Brown. Wilson says 
he 's "implemented" California's death penalty, while Brown 
claims she'll "enforce" it. Wilson says he'll make schools safe 
again, and Brown says she' ll make neighborhoods safe again. 
Wilson says he 's saved California's tax payers millions of dol-
lars, while Brown says Wilson increased taxes by millions of 
dollars. Each says the other won 't keep campaign promises. 

The mud-slinging never stops, and it ' s impossible to tell who's 
sincere or who 's the "career politician," since they all seem to be 
nothing more than professional muckrakers. 

Candidates should take the-rune to sbowcase their qualifica-
tions for the positions they s~k, rather than insult each other. 

Desert Protection Act 
NotaMi~e 

Although some may see the California Desert Protection Act 
as somewhat of a disappointment after amendments were made to 
appease conservatives, tbis bill is a step in the right direction for 
environmental legislation. Considering that the desert bill is the 
biggest land-protection effort passed in Congress since 1980, 
environmentalists should feel victorious with the measures they 
did manage to win. 

The act, steered through Congress by Senator Dianne Feinstein 
preserves four million acres of federal land in Southeastern 
California as wilderness preserve. Death Valley and Josbua Tree 
National Monuments will be redesignated as national parks, and 
1.2 million acres in the Mojave Desert will be established as a 
national park. 

It's easy to understand why environmentalists feel the 
amendments weaken the bill: one ameDdmcot CRates a hunt-
ing preserve in the Mojave, another allows off-roM vehicle 
areas in Imperial County. Yet, thac c:ban&cs scc::m lib small 
compromises c:onsideriDg that supporters of abc act, IIUdt u

DEATH PENALTY IS 
SENSELESS, UNCMLIZED 

COMMENTARY: Despite its overwhelming ~ty, capital punishment 
neither saves the state money nor serves to deter crime 
By Brent JoIInIon 
Contributing Opinion Writer ~. 

If you are in favor of capital punishment, you're not 
alone. According to the Gallup polls, 77 percent of 
Americans favor the death penalty, while oaly 18 
percent oppose it. It's easy to understand why - the 
nation feels it's time to get tough on crime. Death is, 
after all, the greatest terror I person faces. Apparently, 
the nation assumes the threat of death to the criminal 
will: 

• alleviate the economic burden placed upon the 
taxpayer's shoulders by 
incarceration; 

• be administered fairly upon all 
aiminals deserving death, regardless 
of race; 

• have an arresting effect on the 
number of murders which ocaar; 

• be done in an etbical and moral 
manner. 

These IIIUII'Iptiolll, for the DlOIt 
Part, are wrong. 

year. 
There is also evidence that racist bias exists in death 

penalty politics. Since the reinstatement of the death 
penalty in 1976 to May 1994,39 percent of death-row 
inmates have been blade. This is more than three times 
the percentage of blacks in America. 

Between 1930 and 1959, more than balfofthe3,OOO 
people executed were black. Time reports that since 
1988, the government bas prosecuted drug lords under 
a statute which allows it to punue the death penalty. 7~ 
percent of these drug lords have been white, yet the 

government hu only tried to apply 
capital punishment in 36 cases, 
involving four whites, four Hispanics 
and 28 bllCb. 

We often bear the UJUIIICIII that 
we, the taxpayers, should not have to 
bear the costs of providing for 
convicted criminall' life 
imprilonment. Tbe price of capital

Another problem with the death 
penalty is that it does not achieve its 
goal. In order for capital punishment 
to work, it must be unique io its 
deterrent effect on capital crime. 
However, its deterrellCl is apparently 
not very effective, u the number of 
death row inmatel his risen from 
2,021 in 1988 to 2,870 Ibia year.

The UCSD Caardiaa OPINION 5 

CO.MENTAIIY: Death-row inmates should be allowed to donate their OIgans, particularly since there is such a 
low supply of donor organs which would save lives 

CONVICTIONS OF mE HEART 
., AInIt A81r1M11e 
ContTtbutJtW OpInion Writer 

Wadey A1mDodd c:arried an or-
gan dooor stic:br on his driver's Ii-
CCIIIe. At .. 31, he bid never been 
aeriouBIy illlDlhnsinexcdleatshlpe. 
Yet wbea Dodd died, his organs re-
mained with him. Organa which a 
healthy human can donate include the 
eyes, lungs, heart, kidneys, liver and 
blood. Two babies never received 
much-needed liver transplants. Some-
whe~ someone oever received a new 
heart. 

A convicted child-killer, Wes 
Dodd never received his chance to 
give life. He was executed Jan. 7, 
1993 by hanging. at his own request, 
at the Washington State Penitentiary. 
While he was alive, though, he wrote 
2() letters to Dr. JlCk Kevorkian, 
asking for his help in persuading 
prison authorities to let him donate 
his organs. 

Kevorkian, widely known for his 
viewssupportingeuthanasia, was the 
fint to bring the DeaIh-Row Donor 
(ORO) idea to the attention of state 
officials. Yet his proposals were lost 
behind the uproar regarding his as-
sistance in medical suicides. 
Kevorkian first proposed to allow 
death-row inmates to donate organs 
in 19S8. 

The idea gained favorable llten-

lion from inmates and the public, but 
wu Ihot down by doctonaod priIon 
officials. 

"I can't do IIOInetbinswitbout see-
ing a better way of doing it, lID matIer 
what it is,. Kevorkian recently told 
Robert Ourlian and Mike Martindale 
in the DetroU News. This inna drive 
bas brought an end to suffering for a 
number of patients, and I new hope 
for the mndemned. Even for those 
opposed to capital punishment, it takes 
the whole notion of excc:ution one 
step ina positivedim:tion. Kevorkian 
saYlo he is neutral on the issue, but he 
argues that if the law is in effect, then 
we should make the best of it 

Unfortunately, an unwritten rule 
does not allow death-row inmates to 
partake in the life-giving experience, 
thus stealing their only chance at reo 
demption. 

Families of victims say it would 
give convicts a way of dying with 
dignity - something they do not 
deserve. They believe donating or· 
gans would give deatb~row inmates 
a sense of aooomplishment, rather 
than the guilt they deserve. It's a 
shame we Jive in a society which 
believes in stripping the guilty of all 
their power - especially the power 
to save Jives. 

Physicians estimate that 20,(0) 
aitically ill patients are desperately 

P .... .,. the wont 
188I0Il tile 
critically III .re 
elyl.., Is due to • 
lackofn.....-y 
orpas, and the 
stubbor ....... of 
officials and 
alrgeon .. 
in need of organ transplants. With 
such a pressing demand, it is ridicu· 
lously selfish to execute and dispose 
of healthy bodies. The DRD pr0-
posal aIsoc:overs donating the entire 
body formedical researoh. Onanxn 
indirect scale, the number of people 
saved IS a JaUlt of medical reaean:h 
could pofentialIy reach into the mil· 

lions. 
Various memben of the opposi-

tion, of ooune, claim they would not 
want I killer's organa in their bodies. 
The opposition does DOl include any-
one curraJtJy in a hoIpitaI, waiting for 
a transplant. Receiving I rapist's kid-
ney does not make one a rapist any 
more than receiving a lawyer's lung 
would makeone a lawyer. More likely 
than not, the recipient would be more 
engrossed in being alive than in the 
profile of the organ donor. 

Jeny Davis, assistant administra-
tor to the Washington Stale Peniten· 
tiary, said the practice would lead to 
"harvesting organs" -that is, to put 
people on death row expressly for the 
opportunity to take their organs. Yes, 
it alUld create an entirely new bias in 
the process of the oourt. Then again, 
in this country, the judge and jury are 
chosen for their absence of biases. 
Condemning a man in the hopes that 
he will donate an organ would be 
highly unlikely. 

Cmying out this procedure re-
quires the inmate to die by lethal 
injection. Electrocution damages too 
much of the body, and a firing squad 
pIainJyslueds usabJeorgans. (The use 
of the ps chamber was banned in 
Califomiaon Oct.~, 1994 by Federal 
Judge Marilyn Hall Patel) Under the 
ORD procedure, the inmate is placed 

in an unconsdous state, after which 
organs are removed. Once the opera· 
tion is done, the inmate is given a 
lethal injection, while stiU uncon-
scious. 

Wes Dodd's attorney attempted to 
find a surgeon to perfonn the opera-
tion. Not one surgeon in Washington 
or Oregon even agreed to talk with 
Doddor his attomey. Dodd had wanted 
to donate an eye and a kidney while he 
was still alive, but he was refused that 
request as well. "There's no doubt 
that with the execution... six other 
people died," said Kevorkian about 
Dodd, in the CNtroiJ News. 

Perhaps the worst reason the criti-
cally ill are dying is due to a lack of 
neassary organs, and the stubborn-
ness of officials and surgeons. 
Kevorkian's refusal to end his unor-
thodox practices has discredited his 
name and title, and no one with the 
power to implement the ORD pro-
gram into effect has mme forward. 

Death-Row Donor provides one 
of the best solutions to the problem of 
a limited organ supply. It would give 
inmates the chance to do something 
good for the community, literal IUI-
lowing them to save many lives. 
Maybe the only way prison or state 
officials will endorse DRD is when 
one of them ends up on the operating 
table, in need of a new heart.

DEATH: 
Capital punishment a 
barbaric tradition 
CoIItInued ......... 4 

Finally, the ethics of killing a 
buman being in the name of state-
imposed vengeance leaves much to 
be desired. We are led to believe if 
we can kill a man quickly and 
without pain, we'll be able to conduct 
a civilized execution. Tell that to tbe 
family of Josepb Tafero. Tafero 
roasted to death after six minutes on 
May 4, 1990, after beingjolted three 
times by what turned out to be a 
weak current. 

All moral codes say, in one way 
or another, that people may take the 
life of an attacker, in defense of 
either tbeir own or another's life. 
Yet, once the threat of an attack has 
been eliminated, tbere is no moral 
justification for taking the life of a 
criminal. 

As MacNamara points out, " ... 
tbe individual citizen bas no rigbt in 
law or morals to slay as punisbment 
for an act, no matter how vile, already 
committed; nor bas he legal or moral 
justification to kill wben ... the 
imminent danger is eliminated and 
tbe criminal attack or altempt 
discontinued. " 

The state, as a collection of 

1'Iuanday, October 13,1994 

individual. repre.eDtin, tbe 
iBdividual, must by nec:euity, be 
ruled by the same principle. It may 
defend itlelfthrough ita police fon:e 
when an attacker rampages and 
harms its citizens. But if the attacker 
is apprehended and detained, tbe 
state should not take his life. 

Capital punishment is .ick and 
wrong. We cannot justify the penalty 
economically, we cannot apply the 
penalty fairly and we cannot claim it 
acts as a dete~nt. But even without 
tbese problems, the penalty is 
inherently unetbieaJ. The taking of 
buman life, in the name of justice, 
doesn't satisfy tbe state or tbe 
criminal 'ssurvivors.It 'san ancient, 
barbaric ritual which attempts to 
exact some sort of repayment for 
crimes wbich can never be repaid, 
even with tbe criminal's life. 

It's easy to understand vengeance 
and the need (or retribution. 
However, emotion, the volatile, 
explosive element of our lives, must 
never be allowed to rule in place of 
our intellects. Thougb our ability to 
feel anger and hate toward the 
criminal sets us apart as human 
beings, it is our intelligence which 
allows us to live peacefully in a state 
of civilization. We are in danger of 
being so desensitized to murder that 
we are ready to hold tbe weapon 
ourselves.

COMMENTARY: In an attempt to 'combat racism,' Ua;D distnbuted an essay which villifies whites, claiming they 
use their power to systematically oppress minorities 

UCSD DISTRIBUTES RACIST LITERATURE 
BrDeNk .......... 
ContrIbutJrw OpInIon Write, 

"No individual can be racist in 
isolation... BlacD canDOt be rac-
ista ... " These are excerpts from an 
essay by Bisbop Riebl Massaro en-
titled "Combatting Racism," wbicb 
UCSD distributed to studenta mov-
ing onto campus tbis yeu. These are 
examples of the beliefs which UCSD 
encourages its students to accept. 

It is frigb~ing to see a univer-
sity, wbicb supposedly educates 
some of the most intelligent stu-
dents in tbe country, endorse such 
statements. In his essay, Massaro 
attempts to define racism, discrimi-
nation and stereotyping; but in tbe 
process, incorrectly defined these 
terms, made unsubstantiated and 
contradictory statements, and said 
notbing to "combat racism," 

Massaro began the essay by ap-
plying his own, artificial definition 
of.the word "racism," as "tbe power 
individuals and groups of one race 
use to systematically oppress those 
of another race. "This isan incorrect 
definition. 

The true definition, according to 
most dictionaries, is "tbe belief that 
a particular race, especially one's 
own, is superior to other races." The 

word can also incorporate other defi-
nitions, including "discrimination 
or prejudice against a race or races 
based on tbis belief." These defini-
tions say nothing about systematic 
oppression of anotber race, as 
Massaro states. 

Massaro then adds 10 bis defini-
tion of racism: "the uumption tbat ... 
traits and abilities are determined 
by a biological race, and tbat races 
differ decisively from one another 
in tbis respect." In the proceeding 
paragrapb, the essay says, "the ma-
jority of wbite males (in power p0-
sitions) make 'power decisions' .. , 
wbich benefit white people." The 
assumption that only whites make 
"power decisions" is a racist state-
ment. 

Massaro says, "the decision mak-
ers are consciously making racist 
decisions in that they realize to some 
degree tbat their decisions will im-
pact more favourably on wbite 
people tban on minorities. Even witb 
this input, tbey are still not con-
cerned abeut getting input from mi-
norities ..... This is a gross generali-
zation and a stereotype. Yet, the 
university endorses it. 

Massaro states that "blacks can-
not be racists. " This is a false state-

~

statements. 
ment, no matter which definition 
you use. His essay contends that 
"[blacks) are not in a sufficiently 
influential stance to translate tbeir 
objectives into power, which is a 

structural orcultural form that would 
discriminate against wbite people." 
This too is wrong. While blacks 
may not be as influential as wbites, 
they certainly bave influence in cru-
cial spheres of society. 

Numerous black individuals 
work in powerful positions. As in-
fluential individuals, they are ca-
pable of carrying out tbe interests of 
other blacks. Oprab Winfrey is cited 
by many as tbe most powerful per-
son on television. Bill Cosby is 
equally influential. Spike Lee is re-
garded as one of the best directors in 
the world. In one oftbe most power-
ful industries in the world, these 
blacks control many decisions. 

Contrary to Massaro's assertion 
that "blacks cannot be racists," there 
is a constant display of black racism 
toward whites. ABC's "Nightline" 
recently profiled various black com-
munities in Los Angeles, focusing 
on stores and businesses owned by 
blacks. The owners of these busi-
nesses said they intentionally sought 
only black customers and black busi-
ness partners, and asked black citi-
zens to refrain from supporting 
white-owned businesses. 

According to Massaro, discrimi-
nation is "the act, practice or in-

Recycle the Guardian 

stance of discriminating categori-
cally rather than individually. It is 
the according of differential treat-
ment of persons of an alien race or 
religion." This is exactly what the 
black store-owners in tbese LA. 
neighborhoods were doing, thereby 
qualifying tbem as racists, even by 
Massaro's own definition. 

But the opinions expressed in bis 
essay are not the main problem-
everyone is entitled to his own opin-
ion. UCSD, however, should not 
affirm tbat these opinions are cor-
recl. It is the university'S responsi-
bility to remain objective. 

Massaro 's essay effectively does 
the opposite of what it hopes to 
accomplisb, wbich is to combat rac-
ism. Condemning the white race as 
racist and suggesting that it is com-
pletely and unconsciously ignoring 
the needs of minorities will only 
serve to anger whites. 

The university is in effect tell-
ing white students they should feel 
guilty for what whitedecision-mak-
ers have done. This could not pos-
sibly encourage whites to combat 
racism. Seeing the university sup-
port statements such as "blacks can-
not be racists" will anger whites 
even more.

in their own health.· 

Saltman became interested in the 
relationship between trace minerals 
and bone when he attended a sports 
and nutrition seminar in 1980, 
where he examined X-rays of bas-
ketball player Bill Walton's feet. 
Walton had been experiencing re-
peated fractures and foot problems 
that were hindering his career. 
Sallman noticed that Walton's bone 
appeared to be a case of 
osteoporosis. 

Saltman obtained permission to 
test Walton's blood and discovered 
that while high quantities of cal-
cium were present, copper and zinc 
levels were low and manganese was 
completely absent.

world-renowned San Diego Zoo, has 
more members in San Diego County , 
Shelley added. 

Revenues have also been boosted 
through the evening rental of the 
Aquarium to private groups several 
times during the week, according to 
Shelley. 

The Aquarium-Museum, which 
has an operating budget of approxi-
mately $2.2 million annually, is es-
sentially breaking even, Shelley 
added.

Sallman hopes that Proctor and

The Heartbreak 
Of Wreslting 

So there I was, passing a lazy 
Saturday morning by channel-
surfmg through Bugs Bunny, 
bowling and grade-B movies, 
searching desperately for a 
football game. 

Instead, I stumbled upon two 
sweaty Neanderthals bouncing 
around a ring, clobbering each 
other like there wu no tomorrow 
in front of a rabble of 600 -
unkempt, unrefined, brain-dead 
individuals. 

Professional wrestling - what 
a great sport. The living embodi-
ment of America's ideals: its put, 
present and future. 

Hardly. But there is no 
question that tbe spectacle has 
carved out an undeniable subcul-
ture. Not to suggest thai Ken 
Bums is readying an 18-hour 
miniseries or anything, but 
wrestling's longevity is impres-
sive as well as inexplicable, 
considering how dumb.the sport 
is. 

I must profess, I grew up 
loving the stuff. Ten years ago, 
you would have been hard-pressed 
to find anyone who was a bigger 
Hulk Hogan fan than myself. 

lbat is, until I made a shock-
ing revelation ... It was all fake.

And really, as a kid, it didn't

UCSD Titans Noose on Fullerton 
NEW RECORD: With 1-0 Division r triumph, UCSD sets mark for regular season unbeaten streak 

I needed wrestling. As the 
painful realities of the world 
began to dawn on me, I could lose 
myself in the superhuman exploits 
of the Macho Man and Junkyard 
Dog. I desperately needed to 
believe some real-life heroes 
actually existed; larger-than-life 
men that transcended normal, 
human shortcomings. These men, 
gods in my eyes, provided me this 
illusion; they stood on another 
plane. 

Once I hit my teenage years 
though, I became too cynical to be-
lieve in wrestling anymore. I real-
ized that wrestling was ... well ... stu-
pid. 

But tell that to the throngs of 
loyal riffraff who follow it, and

Despite a referee who was too 
busy exchanging insults with the 
fans and an opposing team which 
may moonlight as a roller-derby 
&quad, the UCSD women's soc-
cer team (8~-2) pulled out a 1-0 
overtime triumph over host Cal 
State Fullerton on Tuesday. The 
win over the Tilans was the Tri-
tons' 32nd victory oftheircunent 
regular season unbeaten streak, a 
mark that eclipsed tbe 1987-89 
record of 31 in a row. 

The last time UCSD lost a 
regular-season contest was Oct. 9, 
1992, when the Tritons dropped a 
2-0 decision to Cal Lutheran. 
Since that loss, which is the Tri-
tons' only regular-season defeat to 
a Division III team in UCSD his-
tory, the team has gone 28-0-4. 

The record, however, did not 
come easy for the Tritons. AI-

though UCSD makes a habit of play-
ing Division I and II teams, it tends 
to have trouble with the physical 
playing style of most of those oppo-
nents. From the outset of Tuesday'S 
game, Fullerton made it clear that it 
was out to knock the Tritons into 
submission. "They were twice as 
physical as Westmont," said UCSD 
Head Coach Brian McManus, refer-
ring to last Friday's 1-1 match that 
the coach had termed "the most 
physical game of the year." 

Anticipating the Fullerton strat-
egy, McManus made a few changes 
to his gameplan.,Junior Diana 
Muchowski, normally one of the 
keystones to the Triton defense, 
started the game up front. 
Muchowski was ·to slow down the 
Titan sweeper, normally the player 
who got Fullerton's offense rolling. 

UCSD also stepped up the tempo 
of its passing game, in order to coun-
teract the Titans' speed, and in-

the officiating. "It wu abysmal. The 
other OOICh was calling the ref by 
bis first name and uking Ibout eacb 
foul. When the crowd started chant-
ing at the ref, he sbouted back .t 
them. One girl threw • water bottle· 
.t him and he only gave her • yel-
low card," McManus said. 

After 120 minutes of IOCICCr, the 
Tritons had racked up 21 fouls and 
two yellow cards, wbile Fullerton 
was guilty of only 12 fouls. In tbe 
first balf .Ione, UCSD was whistled 
13 times while the home team was 
penalized only once. 

The fouls definitely stifled the 
UCSD .ttack, but the Tritons' best 
sc:oring chance of regulation was • 
result of the only pen.lty called 
against Fullerton. UCSD couldn't 
convert, however, when Dawn Lee's 
penalty kick missed wide rigbt. 

As the second balf came to an 
end, the Tritons found themselves 
pleasantly surprised. Despite play-
ing their fourth game in eight days 
while Fullerton was coming off a six 
day break, UCSD began to take con-
trol. 

"Our fitness came througb for 
us," UCSD's Brandie H.yungs said. 
They were a lot more tired than we 
were, so we started to dominate. " 

The sc:oreless tie was finally bro-
ken after 111 minutes. After • UCSD 
throw in, Hayungs ended up with the 
ball near tbe top-Ieft comer of the 
penalty box . She lost it , but 
Muchowski tapped it right back to 
the sophomore. Hayung5, who had 
her back to the goal, turned and fired

"I didn't tbink it wu going to go 
in," Hayungs said. "The box was 
reilly crowded because they had 
their whole team packed in there. I 
didn't get I very good touch on it so 

I didn't think it would make it 
through." 

Hayungs' game winner was one 
of 11 UCSD shots. The Tritons again 
outs hot their opponents, holding 
Fullerton to just six. 

With one battle behind them, the 
Tritons must immediately recover 
for another one on Friday, when 
USC comes to town. "(The Trojans] 
are another very physical team, hut 
they ' re not as dirty," McManus said 

"Fullerton was rough and I got 
beat up, but they also had some skill. 
USC will be as physical, but they ' ll 
have more skill," Hayuogs said. " II 
should be a great game, but the 
toughest of the year for us. We' re 
still tired from the last two games." 

"The reeord being broken now is 
more impressive than it was in 
1989," the coach-said. "We have a 
lot tougher schedule now, but there 
are also a lot of other similuities be-
tween this team and that one. Instead 
of eight or nine people we could de-
pend on, we've got 15 or 16, the 
whole roster. We had that in ]989, 
too. 

"But this team is more comfort-
able with the ball. We have a better 
p.ssing game and know bow to 
knock it around the field," Mc 
Manus said. 

"We have a lot of depth. There's 
no drop off after the starters," 
Hayungs said. "We're so strong_"

The 1989 team is a good example 
for this year's Tritons to follow -

national championship.

Perhaps most unsettling of all is 
seeing that the icons of my youth are

around, as well are a number of other

UCSD Coaching Brass Gains Three Stars 
NEW BLOOD: Greg Lanthier, Robert Fletcher and Brian Turner take over men's baskeetball, baseball and men's tennis; 
replacing Tom Marshall, Lyle Yates and Tim Ditzler; only Fletcher has previous experience in Tritondom 

By .,... K. Hutto 
Senior Starr Wrlfer 

With one of the top sports pr0-
grams in the country, UCSD boasts 
not only some of the best athletes, 
but some of the best coaches as 
well. 

And while .thletes at UCSD 
eventu.lly gr.du.te .nd leave 
school, coaches can also graduate, 
in a matter 9f speaking, and move 
up in the coaching ranks 

Two of the coaches which left 
UCSD over the summer did just that. 
Both men's basketball Head Coach 
Tom Marshall and baseball skipper 
Lyle Yates left the friendly confines 
of UCSD to teach their .rt else-
where. 

Marshall accepted a position with 
Division II Cal Poly Pomona, while 
Yates, after 12 seasons (297-256-6) 
.t UCSD, accepted a position as mi-
nor league pitching coach with the 
Texas Ranger organization. 

Men's tennls Head Coach lim 
Ditzler also left the school, but not 
to pursue a coaching career. Ditzler, 
who compiled a 19-22 record as 
coach, is pursuing a post-graduate 
degree. 

Fi11i~g thc!se vac;ancies for the 
1994-9.5 season are Greg Lanthier, 
Robert Fletcher and Brian Turner,

ll-season reign and qualified for the 
NCAA Division 1II postseason three 
of the last four years, including two 
stints to the final 16 (,91, '92). 

But Lanthier, a native San 
Diegan, is no stranger to succas. M-
ter graduating from Mt Carmel High 
School in 1981, Lanthier guided Pt. 
Lorna College to three National 
Christian College Championships 
and.n impressive record of 100-35 
over his playing career. 

Thougb his pl.ying days may 
have ended upon his graduation with 
• degree in business admi!1istration 
in 1987, hisOOIChingdays were just 
starting. 

Lanthier ac:cepted a junior varsity 
coacbing position .t his alma-mater 
in 1987, but wu quickly snatched 

up by Palomar League rival Vista 
High School in 1988, where he 
coached freshman ball. He was soon 
promoted to director of the varsity 
program in 1989. They were not dis-
appointed. 

In his last two years at Vista, the 
P.nthers compiled a 54-7 record (in-
cluding a 41-game winning streak 
over San Diego County opponents 
and 28 consecutive games without 
a loss), two straight Palomar League 
Ch.mpionships .nd two str.ight 
California Interscholastic Federation 
Division I titles. Not too shabby. 

So why would he want to leave 
such. suoc:essful program?

different kind of challenge for me. 
lt was the right time to take on some-
thing new. Vista still has a great 
group of players, but I thought it was 
time for a step-up. UCSD already 
has a good program in place. I hope 
to continue the success of Marshall's 
program." 

No doubt Lanthier can do just 
that, but don ' t expect to see the 
Marshall game plan. 

"We will run a totally different 
style of basketball," Lanthier said. 
"It is a system that is much more 
uptempo witb constant pressure de-
fense. Vista led the county in scor-
ing and three years ago we led the 
county in three-point shooting. We'll 
put the ball up, no doubt about that. " 

Basketball has taken over 
Lanthier 's family as well as his pro-
fessional. He and his wife are Ihe 
proud parents of a one-year old son, 
Trey (named after the three-point 
shot) and have another one on the 
way. "If it 's a girl, we'll name her 
Jordan," Lanthier said. 

Fletcher has already spent some 
time with the Triton baseball pro-
gram. Serving as the team's hitting 
coach in last year 's record-setting 
33-8 season, Fletcher was instru-
mental in UCSD's incredible third-
place run through the NCAA Divi-
sion III ColJege World Series. 

Fletcher is also a San Diego na-
tive, graduating from Serra High

Not a Good Knight for 
Rega1s; UCSD Wins in Five 
SQUIAKER: The Tritons struggled in games two and four but managed to 
bounce back in the rubber game, putting away Cal Lutheran, 15-7 
By'" Knft 
Spotts Co-EdItor 

After a touJb weekend during 
which it IUffered two blemishes to 
its record, the UCSD women'l vol-

leyball team 
wu looking to 
rebound against 
a tougb Divi-
sion III oppo-
nent in Cal 
Lutheran. 

The Regals 
invaded the Tri-
ton Gymna-
lium on 
Wednesday 
night boasting a 
number-two 

ranking in the Western Region be-
bind UCSD and looking for I big 
upset to boost tbemlelves to the top. 
Cal Lu battled the Tritons bard for 
five-sets before UCSD prevailed 
(15-9,15-17, lS-4, 5-1!!, 15-7). 

Triton fans were happy to see that 
junior outside hitler Angelle Crochet 
wu able to stut'thilgame after sit-
ting out the lut 'tWo contests with a 
pinched nerVe in her neck. 

-Having Angelle back was 
great," UCSD Head Coacb Doug 
Dannevik said. "She bun't fully re-
covered, but she really belped UI." • 

Despite the nagging injury, Cm-
~het played almost the entire con-

tat and wasted no time in making 
, ber prelence felt. Sbe tallied 

UCSD's first two points of the IIIIICII 
on a dink sbot and a cross court 
smuh, giving the Tritona I quick, 
two-point advantage. 

Throughout the remainder of the 
set, the two squads were nec:lt-and-
neck with UCSD grabbing alate 10-
8 advantage. The Tritolll theft turned 
up the beat tallying five of the next 
six points to tab the pme 15-9. 

UCSD stumbled at the outset of 
the second pme quickly falling be-
hind 6-0. The Tritons then hepn a 
long proceu of climbing beck into 
the set. The crowd roared to its feet 
wben Madelyn Ripken Imoked a 
ball down the right side of the Cal 
Lu defense, bringing UCSD witbin 
four points at 12-8, 

With the score tied at 14, Crochet 
once again came through, dinking a 
ball over the blocken to give the 
TritoDl a game point. A service er-
ror pve the Regals I much-needed 
sideoat, however, and they took full 
advantage scoring three consecutive 
points to win the set, 17-15, knot-
ting the match at a game apiece. 

The third set was all UCSD from 
the get-go. The Tritons went lhead 
14-4 when Julie Harvey flew in on 
the left side and pulverized a set 
from Jennifer Schofield. 

Harvey tben helped put tbe pme 

'tiM) 
IQCIQ presents .. _ 

with the 
SMlDIE60 

away when she and Kristi Askeland 
went up strong and stuffed a Cal Lu 
blocker to give UCSD a 2-1 lead in 
gamel. 

Game four was jUit u one-aided 
in the Repl's favor u game three 
bad been for tbe Tritons. Cal Lu 
stormed out to an 8-1 lead and never 
looked back en route to a 15-5 vic-
tory that forced the match into a fifth 
and deciding game. 

Game five was played Uling rally 
scoring in wbicb a point is awarded 
on every serve. With the pressure on, 
UCSD came through. 

Middle blocker Christine Chi 
pve the Tritons an early 3-1 lead 
when she crushed a slide set from 
Schofield. UCSD wu up 7-4 when 
Ripken once again showed off her 
powerful hitting stroke with • burner 
down the middle. 

Chi then served an ace down tbe 
line to ~ the Tritons to a 9-4 ad-
vantage. 

The Repls did not concede the 
game, however. They clawed back 
to within 10-7 before UCSD recov-
ered its poise to put the contest away. 

Harvey dinted a quick set from 
Schofaeld, over and down, to stop 
Cal Lu'a momentum and stake the 
Tritolll to an 11-7 lead. Crochet then 
pounded I ball off the Regal's block 
and out of bounds to make the lead 
four points.

Schofield and Ripken clicked 
once again on game point when 
Ripken crushed a beautiful slide set 
from Schofield right down the 
middle of the Repl defense to close 
out the match. 

"We made some errors at critical 
times and got out to poor starts in 

the second and forth games," Dan-
nevik said. "But we broke tbem 
down eventually. We blocked a lot 
of balls and did a good job in the 
games we won." 

The Tritons will be hosting the 
UCSD Collegiate Invitational this

Nine Inch Nails 
Trent Rezrwr's rage is tempered 

BrWl ..... 
Hiatus Editor 

It would be easy to dismiss Nine 
Inch N.ils' Trent Reznor u just an-
other angry young man, one of • long 
line of pop culture's prophetic pur-
veyors of gloom. Not only does the 
28-year·old sin,er incessantly 
sc:reec:h about his alienation on N1N's 
albums, but be .Iso takes his temper 
on stage with him, actin, like • 
spoiled child u he constantly knocks 
down microphone stands, kicks over 
amplifien .nd throws cups of water 
onto tbe crowd. But during Monday 
night's one-and-a-half-hour perfor-
mance .t the Sports Arena, Reznor 
inflected bis music with enough com-
passion to make it more than just .n 
empty, angst-ridden exercise. 

Nine Inch Nails fittingly opened 
its l8-song set with "Mr. Self De· 
struct" from its recent .Ibum The 
DowflwQrd SpirQI. As Reznor 
clutclled tbe microphone and stood 
poised like be was ready to do battle 
with tbe crowd, he sang lines like "I 
am the needle in your vein/ I am tbe 
high you can't sustain." The song is 
an appropriate summ.tion of 
Reznor's role as a rock performer. 
He serves as a catalyst which unveils 
the violence and despair of human 
relationships. With pulsating drum 
beatsandslicingguitarchords,songs 
like "Reptile," "Head like a Hole" 

and "Closer" provided appropriate 
vehicles for Reznor's nge, though 
the singer did not· shy from showing 
a gentler side during the concert. 

Midw.y through tbeset, a screen 
came down in front of tbe band. As 
films were shown on it, the group 
continued to play in the background. 
Most audiences would find this ap-
proach a1ienatin$t but because Nine 
Inch Nails' music is about alien· 
ation, tbe screen only heightened the 
tension of the show. "Hurt," a song 
in whicb Reznor laments "Everyone 
Ilmow/ goes away in tbe 'end," be-
came particularly potent u images 
of animals and plants dying flashed 
across the screen. But tbe final pic-
ture, an .nimal's body recomposing 
(done by reversing the time lapse 
photography) offered hope. 

While Reznor's actions !lOIoe· 
times seemed contrived, he displayed 
an uncanny ability to project his 
moods upon the audience. When he 
yelled, "Don't you tell me how I 
feeVyou don't know just how I feel," 
be expressed the apathy of. genera· 
tion .nd provided a catb.rtic release 
for f.ns pushed up agaiost the stage. 

Reznor is an agressive, high-
energy performer, but this alone does 
not put him on the cutting edge. His 
.bility to diffuse his anger with sin-
cere soul-searching shows he is not 
just .nother tortured artist.

The Ligllbling Seeds 
}o1Ji,E!tion 

'1'1" •• - ........ 

TIred of grunge and its message 
of alienation? The Lightning Seeds 
are striking back at the disenchant· 
ment of Generation X with its latest 
offering, Jollification. 

Critically acclaimed singer-
songwriter Ian Broudie, who pro-
duced tracks for 
such artists as 
Echo and the 
Bunnymen, and 
Alison Moyet, is 
a multi-faceted 
musician with an 
innate under-
standing of both 
rhythm and mel-
ody. 

He displays 
this talent once 
again on Jol-
lification, the Lightning Seeds' third 
album. The Lightning Seeds com-
bine bittersweet sentiments, opti-
mism and dry humor to produce fun 
lyrics that, though not IS flighty as 
those of Shonen Knife, are a blessed 
relief from the angst of bands like 
Nirvana and Pearl Jam. 

However, this album is not with-
out its problems. As a vehicle for 
Ian Broudie, the Lightning Seeds 
display his hallmark ability to force 
different musical elements together. 
Though this can be invigorating for 

the first two songs, soon the eclec-
tic mix of "Partridge Family" har· 
monies and '80s keyboards become 
less amusing. The excessive use of 
synthesizers also becomes less 
electro-pop in songs such IS "Mar-
vellous," with its long introduction 

which has no 
musical connec-
tion to the main 
body of the song. 

Despite its 
. problems, 
Jollifu;ation is a 
solid album with 
upbeat dance-
oriented tracks, 
and Broudie ' s 
wispy voice does 
justice to its 
lively lyrics . 

Standouts include "Lucky You," 
the album 's first single, and "My 
Best Day" (sung with guest artist 
Alison Moyet). Though not recom-
mended for grunge fans, this is defi-
nitely an album to listen to when 
you're on a saccharine high. 

The Lightning Seeds will per-
form with the female duo Murmurs 
and Natasha 's Ghost at the Flash 

Caf~ in Mission Valley on Oct. 18.

Carpenter ............. 

.. 11 .. "., ..... 11,."" .... - A ...... ... Given the success of its debut 
album, Everybody Else Is DoiIIg It, 
So Why Can't We, the Cranberries 
must have felt a certain amount of 
pressure in recording a follow-up. . 
Its latest album, No Need to Argue, 
lives up to any expectations listen-
ers might have after Everybody. 

If I Wen a Carpen. 
ter, a compilation of 
Carpenters' standards 
covered by various "al-
temative" bands, is a 
mixed bag of mostly pleasant' 
songs. If you liked the original 
versions, and you like or respect 
the band doing the cover, you'll 
probably enjoy the new versions as 
well. 

Shonen Knife 's giggly version 
of "Top of the World" clearly 
shows why the Carpenters are still 
so loved despite their lack of origi-
nality. 

Compared to their usual over-
the-top style, Babes in Toyland 's 
sound is subdued on its cover of 
"Calling Occupants of Interplan-
etary Craft." The Cranberries do a 
competent version of "Close to 
You." 

The two stellar tracks on the al-
.iIi. bum are turned out by Sonic Youth 

and Bettie Serveert. Sonic Youth, 
with a sound that merges the 
~~=-=--.I musical styles it has adopted over 

the lut 10 years, swerves through 
~iii!!i!!i!m!!!!!!J ·Superstar" with a dirty mix of dis-

It's not surprising to see Sonic 
Youth on t~is compilation, since 
its song "Tunic (Song for 
Karen)" from the album Goo was 
Sonic Youth bassist Kim 
Gordon 's tribute to Karen 
Carpenter's anorexic demise. 

The Serveert track, "For All 
We Know," which is perhaps 
one of the Carpenters' best love 
songs, sounds ex tremely J. 
Mascis/ Neil Young influenced. 
Serveert 'scover suggests that it 
may be the Carpenters of 
today: utterly unoriginal yet 
undeniably hum mabIe. 

Of course, the other bands on 
the compilation also fit the 
mold of uninspired, pleasant 
pop with a distortion pedal. 

As is the case with most com-
pilations, If J Were a Carpenfer 
contains the usual mix of 
standout tracks and mediocre 
songs. 

Distinct vocalist Dolores 
O'Riordan leads the group, which is 
best known for its hits "Linger" and 
"Dreams." O'Riordan 's elegant and 
unique voice is captivating through-
out No Need 10 Argue. 

Bassist Noel Hogan and drum-
mer Feargal Lawler compose the 
group's so lid rhythm section and 
create a fe rocious sound on "Zom-
bie," a plea to end violence in North-
ern Ireland. 

O'Riordan suggests a reevalua-
tion of the violence: "When the vio-
lence causes silence! We must be 
mistaken.! It 's the same old theme 
since 1916/ In your head they ' re 
still fighting." 

A certain sadness comes through 
on songs such as "Empty," "Yeats ' 
Grave," "Daffodil Lament" and the 
a capella "No Need to Argue." No 
Need is a worthy follow-up for the 
Cranberries.

Motocaster

By Jeff .......

Producer Mitch Easter, who bas 
worked with ac:ts .ucb as R.E.M. 
and his own band, the now«-
funct, Let's Active, is famous for 
recordina music cIwactcrized by 
follt·inOucncecI,cbiming-Ridten-
backer guitan. But don't think 
Motocuter hal a cleaD, crisp sound 
just because Easter produced its 

new album, Slay Loaded. 
"The truth is that be is a very 

intense lead guitar player and his been 
for years," said Motocaster bassist 
John Hcames, who played with Eas-
ter in Let'. Active. "He's always been 
a guitar player who pla)'l the way we 
do, but he just bun't produced a band 
thai wanted to go for a heavier sound. 
Maybe now people wiD realize he is 
not all about Rickenbackers and clean

guitar sounds." 
Motocuter, a trio from Raleigh, 

NC., is currently on a nation-wide 
tour and will open for the 
Supersuckers at the Casbah on Sun· 
day. Hcames said that although 
nearby ChaPel Hill bas received 
much attention for its thriving mu-
sic scene, Raleigh's music scene 
isn't comparable. 

"There isn't much a scene per se

in Raleigh," Hcarnes said. "As bands 
go, we stand out. little bit because 
we'r't not punk rock aU the way and 
not hard rock in the long· hair, 
Marshall-stacks-of-amps way." 

SUly LOGded is a mix of gritty 
guitar work and its melodies are 
often obscured by a blast of sound. 
The lyrical content of the song "Bud-
dha," which was named after a 
neighbor's dog, is essentially im-

possible to decipher. Singer-guitar-
ist Bo Taylor, who writes all the 
lyrics, said he doesn't necessarily 
try to write songs that make sense. 

'" don't try to write about things," 
Taylor said. "If something jells, I 
prefer to make sense of it after it's 
written." 

Motocaster will play at 9 p.m. at 
the Casbah on Sunday. For more

Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) 
is at the center of the second story. 
Willis shows unchancteristic tal-
ent in this part, playing the well-
meanin8, but somewhat dense 
boxer. The story opens a Butch 
wins a fight he wu told to lose by 
Marsallus (Ving.Rhames), the head 
crimeman in Pulp Fiction. Butch 
goes on the nln and plans to head to 
the south seas with his endearing 
and cute sirlfriend Pabienne (Maria 
cIe Medeiros). The moments the 
couple spend tosetber in a seedy 
motel are full of chum atld love.

Like the soundtrack to 
Tarantino's film debut Reservoir 
Dogs, the Pulp Fiction soundtrack 
includes bits of movie dialoJUe as 

The plot turns when Butch discovers 
Fabienne has forgotten his father's 
old watch, a family hierlom. Butch 
returns to his apartment with the 
shadow of MUSlllus lurkin8 near. 

The final story concerns the mis-
adventures Vincent VeIlS and Jules 
Winfield encounter after "doing 
business" as henchmen. As they take 
a hostage during a raid, they escape 
to meet their boss. When the hostage 
is accidentally shot in the car, 
Vincent and Jules enlist the help of 
Jimmie (Tarantino) and the Wolf 
(Harvey Keitel) to clean up the mess. 

Pulp Fiction is a sly and fun ride 
through the lighter side of under-
world life. SOme of the performances 
are brilliant. Samuel L. Jackson is 

leld-iDI to 1CYera1 trICb.

terrific as the Bible-quoting hench-
man who has doubts about his pro-
fession and Willis is made for the 
character Butch. His tough-dumb 
face and ape body fit the character 
appropriately. . 

The strenJlh of this film is that 
it's a pleasure to watch. Unfortu-
nately, the film relies too much on 
its surface appeal. While it's not 
traditional HoUywood fluff by any 
means, the weipt of the film rests 
entirely on its clever dialope and 
plot turns, and ultimately' leaves it 
viewers with nothing more thaD an 
empty sbell. 

Pulp Fiction opens tomorrow at 
the Hillcrest Cinema and at select . 
theaters in San Die80.
