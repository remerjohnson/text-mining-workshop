UCSD receives funds 
for Third, library 

by Mark Stadler 
Senior Editor 

The UCSD campus, Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the 
School of Medicine would receive a total of $2.137 million under 
Gov. Brown's prOpOsed budget for fiscal year 1977-78, campus 
capital budget and space management director Anton Witte said 
last week. . 

UCSD requested $6.773 million from the state to cover 11 
projects, and received funding for nine of them, though not 
necessarily the total amount requested in each case, Witte said. 

o Largest request 
Witte identified the largest single request as $872,000 for the 

expansion of the University Hospital Library. Brown's budget 
allocates $517,000 for the hospital library. 

Two other large requests involved Third College, Unit 2, which 
gained building funds in last year's state budget. Witte said Unit2 
would receive $583,000 for utilities and site development, and 
$325,000 for miscellaneous equipment for the buildings. UCSD had 
requested $430,000 for the equipment. 

Except for the funding for Third, Unit 2 and the hospital library, 
Witte said UCSD is fairly satisfied with Brown's budget proposal. 

" We should have gotten more for Third and the library ," Witte 
said. " We think we can get by with the money allocated for Third, 
and we will try for private gift money to make up the difference for 
the library," Witte said. 

The next step for Brown's budget proposal involves an analysis 
by the state Legislative Analyst. After it is released next month, 
the state Legislature will study the Governor's proposal, and hand 
Brown its own budget version. Brown cannot add items to the 
legislature's budget, but he can remove any item with his " line-
item veto." 

Witte said he does not expect any substantial changes to be made 
with UCSD's share of he budget during the upcoming months. 

Other allocations 
In addition, Witte said, Brown's budget would allocate UCSD: 
- $294,000 for a campus energy conservation project. UCSD 

asked for $441 ,000 for the project, but Brown's budget does not 
cover money that would have been used to heat the campus 
swimming pool with solar power. Witte said UCSD will not gain the 
solar heating funds until UC has completed a study of the 
feasibility of similar plans for other UC campuses; 

- $10,000 for an Environmental Impact Report on plans for 
expansion of the sea wall at Scripps. UCSD requested $344 ,000 for 
the actual project, and expects to receive the money in next year's 
budget . .

Fifth ollege ma es Spicer plans 'clear communication' 
no sense - . Saltman 

by Ran Anbar 
Managing Editor 

While Vice-chancellor of 
Academic Affairs Paul Salt-
man believes the concept of a 
fifth college at UCSD does not 
make sense at this time, 
discussion has taken place 
regarding the financial 
feasibility and alternatives for 
the college. 

A report, which was compiled 
by Associate Vice-chancellor of 
Planning Werner Lenden-
mann, presented a three-phase 
plan which would culminate 
with the establishment of Fifth 
College. 

The first phase of the plan 
would "stretch" the current 
four-college system by 800 new 
undergraduates, which would 
conceivably allow more 
funding to come into UCSD and 
for the decision regarding 
fu rther expansion to be made. 

While this step is necessary in 
order to open a fifth college, it 
would put a severe stress on the 
a lready existing colleges, 
according to the report. 

Possible law school 
The second phase calls for an 

increase in the undergraduate 
enrollment to 9000 and the 
opening of fifth college's first 
module - thus relieving the 
fi rst four colleges of some of the 
student load. It is estimated 
that the second phase, which 
will also include the opening of 
a School of Law and increasing 
library and housing facilities, 
among other developments, 
would cost around $20 million. 

Finally, the third phase 
would increase UCSD enroll-
ment to 10,000 undergraduates 
and 2500 graduate students 
(including 300 law students) 
and opening the rest of the new 
faCilities, bringing the total 
cost of the project to $41.8 
million. 

Funding for Fifth College 
would have to come for the 
most part from the state, and 
uch allocations are simply not 

available, said Saltman. Until 
there is a demand for more 
undergraduates in the UC 
system, UCSD could not be 
allocated funds while Riverside 
is under full capacity, for ex-
ample, explained Saltman. 

The report, Saltman empha-
sized, was made to determine 
the resource needs that are 
essential for a fifth college. 
"But they're not clamouring at 
the door to go in," he said. 

Nonetheless, the report 
submitted to Saltman included 
various alternatives for 
another college's theme, 
compiled over a two-year 
period as a low priority 
activity. 

da Vinci 
How about a Leonardo de 

Vinci College? This proposal 
was submitted by Professor 
John Issac in ·1967. The college 
would be concerned with the 
broad opportunities and 
constraints of the relationships 
of man and his planet. 

Or an Upper Division College 
which is also referred to as 
Transfer College? This concept 
would allow for easy transfer of 
students to UCSD, particularly 
from community colleges. 

A College for Students with 
Disabilities was also proposed. 
The college would be designed 
for those with health limita· 
tions and would allow for 
greater flexibility in comple-
tion of work for those who have 
such a need. 

Other college possibilities 
proposed included a college 
Which would cater to the "very 
top high school graduates" who 
presently enter prestige 
schools such as Cal Tech, 
Harvard and Stanford, accord-
ing to the report. 

The college might also be 
directed at non-traditional 
students such as women 
returning to education, retirees 
or persons changing occupa· 
tions. 

by Andy Schneider 
Associate News Editor 

UCSD clubs and organiza-
tions. and AS activities are now 
under the watchful eye of Scot 
Spicer , newly appointed 
Student Organizations Advisor. 

Spicer said that his initial 
goal will be to assist AS council 
members as they begin to clear 
communication problems 
within the organization of the 
AS. He feels that the role of the 
AS is not clearly defined, and 
that an active cooperation 
between the AS and the college 
governments should be devel-
oped. 

Spicer will be working closely 
with a constitutional review 
committee which is currently 
being organized .and will 
explore means by which the AS 
can increase its effectiveness. 

Many people become disap-
pointed and frustrated, Spicer 

' believes, over the process of 
getting a new govenrment 
started. He hopes to "remo-
tivate and support the good 
ideas which have floated 
around, but haven' t yet been 
acted on. I'm hoping for all of us 
that the original AS hopes can 
be rekindled." 

Give input, have impact 
Communication will be the 

central theme of the programs, 
services and resources pro-
vided by the advisor. "If we can 
work together, there are a lot of 
issues where students can get 
together, give input and have 
impact." Spicer said that he 
intends to meet with all 
organization officers at least 
once a quarter and wants to 
attend as many student 
meetings as possible. 

"I'd like to see student 
organizations take a greater 
focus in student government," 
said Spicer, adding that he 
plans to give particular 
attention to meeting the needs 
expressed by the 135 various 
clubs and campus organiza-
tions. 

Leadership development 
workshops and seminars, in the 
planning stages by Spicer, will 
focus on activity organizing 
membership drives and fund 
management. Spicer's back-
ground in finances and memo 
bership development is already 
available to campus organiza-
tions on an ongoing consultant 
basis. 

St~den' affairs background 
Spicer comes from the 

University of Southern Califor-
nia and brings with him a 
backgrond in Student Affairs. 
His experience includes work 
with commuter students , 
residence halls, fraternities 
and the establishment of 
student representation struc-
tures. 

As an undergraduate at 
Brown University , Spicer 
served as chair of the govern-
ment Finance Board. He also 
participated as a member of 
the admissions, financial aid 
and housing committees . 
During a graduate program in 
which he received both his MS 
and MBA degrees from USC, 
Spicer was elected vice-
chairman of the Graduate 
Student Caucus. 

Spicer places a great value on 
the opportunity for experience 
in student government and 
clubs. " Participation does a lot 
to develop leadership skills. 
The ability to present yourself 
and make your ideas work are 
skills which influence your 
career."

eventually enrolled elsewhere, flied suit lasl month alainllthe UC 
Board of Relents, after the UCSD administralion barred them 
from enrollinl for cl8l8el because they refused to pay for tbeir 
health insurance policy. Their objection to the ,13-quarterly 
health insurance, which Is a mandatory pan of the Registration 
Fee, is that its package includes abortions. The studenlS, who are 
all Catholics, say it is against their religious beliefs to pay money 
into a policy which funds abortions. 

The students' law suit says UCSD is, in effect, denying them 
entrance into the university because of tbelr relilious convictions

~be most apparent Issue connected with this case involves the News Analy.sis 
rilht to choose. The three students say tbey should have the rilht A d f 
to choose whether their fees go toward funding ·abortions. Their What rab mo erates ear 
opponents say a woman's rigbt to control her own body, through an 
abortion if necessary, Is more important_ 

What tbis controversy boils down to is a choice between non· 1-n Begl-n' s peace plan 
negotiable. highly emotional intellectual positions. And the most 
frustrating aspect of the argument over abortion is that, despite 
all the shouting, one side will never convince the other of the 
validity of its claims. 

For our part, we feel a woman's right to choose an abortion is the 
overriding factor of 'he issue, for several reasons. First is the 
basic declaration that a woman should have control over her own 
body. Without such control, which includes both birth control 
devices and abortion as a last resort, she is always in danger of 
becoming a helpless and unwilling fertility machine. 

In addition, abortion should be available because, in the final 
analysis, it is just as important, if not more important, tban any 
other part of the health plan. An unwanted pregnancy has an affect 
not only on a woman's psychological and physical well-being, but 
also on society Itself, because of population control efforts. 

Indeed. tbese considerations make it imperative that the option 
of abortion be part of the health insurance policy, so tbat it is 
available to women who migbt not otherwise be able to afford it. 

There is. however, another issue involved in the students' 
lawsuit, an implicit challenge to the entire UC fee structure. We 
feel this challenge, which could easily have the most far·reaching 
effect of any aspect of the lawsuit, is valid. 

The UC administration argues that the students have to pay 
their fees, even if they do not agree with what the money is being 
used for just as citizens have to pay taxes. But UC's fees are not at 
all like taxes. They are imposed and allocated by appointed 
administrators who are not in the least bit accountable to the 
students wbo pay the fees. Taxes are paid by citizens, who elect 
representatives to impose and allocate them. The UC fee structure 
is, in effect, taxation without representation. 

The fee structure, as it stands now, could easily be destroyed by 
the lawsuit. We think tbis would be a disaster. If, for instance, 
students could pick and choose where they wanted their 
Registration Fees to go, the whole system of services and 
programs would be destroyed. Administrators could easily be 
driven to advertising their programs, in an effort to convince 
students to back tbem financially. 

We would rather see the university avoid such a development by 
allowing student representation on the bodies that impose and 
allocate student fees. 

Write, Please 
One of the most interesting parts of our jobs on the Triton Times 

is receiving letters to the editor. Letters are one of the few constant 
sources of feedback we receive, aside from a stray brick or two 
through the window. 

So we ask: Write. Please. Whatever's on your mind, whatever's 
bothering or pleasing you. We print any letters we receive from 
members of the UCSD community, as long as they aren't legally 
obscene (whatever that is, according to the latest judicial 
interpretation) • 

All we ask is that you limit yourself to one·and-one-half pales

Now that Israel and Egypt 
have apparently a.greed on 
Israeli withdrawal from most 
of the Sinai and on demllitari-
zation of the peninsula, the 
far more difficult problem of 
the occupied West Bank and the 
Gaza Strip looms as the key 
obstacle to lasting peace in the 
Mideast. 

If Anwar Sadat means what 
he says, no peace agreement 
between Egypt and Israel can 
be implemented until the future 
of these areas is determined to 
the satisfaction of Egypt and 
other Arab moderates. And not 
just the radicals of the Arab 
world but Egypt, Saudi Arabia, 
Jordan and the local Palestin-
ian population have rejected 
Israeli Prime Minister Mena-
chem Begin's plan for "self-
rule" in these territories . 

Begin's plan would permit 
Palestinian Arabs internal 
administrative control in most 
of the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. though Israel would 
retain troops and settlements 
there . 

While Begin's proposal does 
not represent an apparent shift 
from sovereignty over these 
areas, the moderate Arabs fear 
that such "self-rule" in the 
West Bank and the Gaza Strip 
would be essentially meaning-
less. Besides their obvious fear 
about Israeli troops and 
settlements there , three 
significant but little-reported 
factors also underlie their 
opposition: 

-Much of the land in certain 
ares of the West Bank and Gaza 
has been brought up for 
development and settlement by 
the Israelis; 

-Arab emigration from the 
West Bank has been high under 
Israeli occupation ; 

-And though Israel hopes 
Jordan 's King Hussein would 
be willing to accept responsibi· 
lity for maintaining order 
among Palestinians in the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip , it is 
unlikely he would do so at the 
risk of political instability in his 
own country. 

Land buys 
Moderate Arab leaders are 

well aware that for the past 
several years the Jewish 
National Fund (JNF), an arm 
of the World Zionist Organiza· 
tion with close connections to 
the Israeli government, has 
been acquiring large parcels of 
landintheWe tBankandGaza 
Strip. 

The JNF has since 1901 
served as the land acquisition 
and development arm of the 
Zionist movement. According 
to the Fund's charter, land, 
once acquired, becomes the 
"inalienable property of the 
Jewish people ." This land 
cannot be sold, and can be 
developed for and settled by 
Jews only. 

Most land purchased by the 
JNF has been from wealthy 
Arabs who have emigrated 
from the West Bank and the 
Gaza Strip and who now live in 
Kuwait, Lebanon or the United 
States. Many of these Arabs 
have been sentenced to death in 
absentia by the Jordanian 
authorities and .the PLO, but 
they have received high prices 
for the land and have taken the 
strictest precautions to avoid 
having their identities re-
vealed. 

In addition, large tracts of 
land formerly used by the 
Jordanian army or listed as 
Jordanian state lands have 
been acquired by the JNF 
without payment as " un-
claimed lands. " And there are 
many areas in which land has 
been expropriated by the 
Israeli government and later 
turned over to the JNF. 

Knowledgeable sources now 
agree, for example, that as a 
result of these combi ne d 
techniques the JNF now owns 
almost 80 percent of the land in 
the Jordan Valley north of 
Jericho. 

To be sure, under Begin's 
plan Arabs from the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip would be able to 
purchase land in Israel proper. 
But since 92 percent of this land 
is owned either by the state of 
Israel or by the JNF, such an 
opportunity would have little 
more than theoretical signifi· 
cance. 

Zero growth rate 
Arab fears that the Wes t 

Bank would soon be bought out 
from under its inhabitants are 
compounded by the fact that 
emigration from that area has 
been high in the 10 years of 
Israeli occupation. In fact, the 
West Bank - whose inhabi· 
tants have one of the highest 
natural growth rates in the 
world - has had a net popula· 
tion growth of zero in the past 
several years. 

Yet under Begin's proposal, 
immigration of Palestinian 
Arabs from Jordan, Lebanon 
and Syria would be prevented 
while Jewish immigration into

Jesus: More 
than medicine 
Editor: 

I am a Christian, and I quite 
agree with Ted Burke's objection 
(" ... Snake Oil." TT. Jan. 13) to a 
Christian telling him to put his 
"mind at a blank ... " That's not the 
message Jesus teaches! He tells 
eve ryone to calculate the cost 
(Luke 14: 27-35) . Nor are the main 
teachings of Jesus concerned with 
how we can escape hell , but rather, 
with how we can have an abundant 
life. And we, a Chrisitans. are 
instructed by Jesus Himself to tell 
others about the abundance we've 
found. I agree with Ted Burke (and 
T.S. Eliot) that every individual'S 
sa lvation is a personal matter 
between himself and God . The 
Christian's job is to let everyone 

Discrimination 
against women 
Editor: 

I think we should consider 
whether we want discrimination 
(for or against women) or not. 
EITHER we treat rape as a sexual 
act. against women. and organize 
special Rape Awareness Weeks. 
Rape Task Forces, etc .. . OR we 
rega rd men and women as equals , 
try to prevent (or punish) all acts of 
violence against persons. male or 
female, young or old. and strive to 
protect children and the elderly. 
and weaker men as well as women. 
(personally, I'm all in favor of 
equal rights.) I don't see how we. 
can expect to have it both ways. 

G. OSCURO

(Continued from page 2) 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
would be unrestricted. 

Arabs thus fear the loss of 
their demographic prepon-
derance in these areas. The 
well publicized proposal by 
Israeli Minister of Agriculture 
Arik Sharon (who is also 
Chairman of the Interminister· 
ial Committee on Land Settle· 
ment) - that two million Jews 
be settled in the West Bank over 
the next generation - did 
nothing to allay these anxieties. 

JonlaD's hesitance 
Finally, there is the problem 

of Jordan. 
Both President Sadat and 

Israeli leaders have expressed 
their belief that the strong links 
that exist between the Palestin-
ian populatiOn on the West 
Ba nk and King Hussein ' s 
regime on the East Bank should 
continue. A federation between 
the East and West Banks and 
the Gaza Strip would include a 
majority of Palestinians_ 

Clearly, Sad at views this as a 
sol ution to the Palestinian 
problem that would satisfy the 
Arab world . And tbe Israelis 
hope that King Hussein would 
be willing to assume responsi-
bility for maintaining order and 
calm among the Palestinians in 
these areas in return for 
continued Jordanian political 
influence there. 

But King Hussein has little 
reason to accept any Israeli 
offer that would burden him 
with one million more highly 
politicized Palestinians.

know that there is a choice to be 
made - a conscious decision for or 
against God. 

Perhaps, at the most secular 
worst, we evangelical Christians 
could be compared to medicine 
show " hucksters. " but even the 
worst of critics must admit that the 
"potion" being "sold" is clearly 
labled. with all ingredients listed-
in the Bible. 

I challenge every student and 
every member of the staff to read 
the Gospel according to John 
and/or any of the other Gospels 

(there are some variatiOll oetween 
Gospels) . Face it - Jesus was the 
most influential man to ever live, 
and your education isn't complete ' 
without knowing what He did to 
make so many people believe that 
He is the Son of God . Some people 
won ' t read the Bible because 
they're afraid of it. or afraid of what 
their " friend s" might say. I 
promise that the Bible won't bite. If 
it's only a book. then you've got 
nothing to worry about. And if it is. 
as I believe. the Word of God. then 
how much more you should read it!

Eliminating abortion is 
anti-life attitude toward women 
Editor; 

We at the Women 's Center feel that the abortion issue raised by the three 
"dissidents" should be seen beyond the simplicity of civil disobedience or 
religious persecution by the administration. We would like to remind all 
women on campus that currently we are witnessing a counter. or 
reactionary. revolution that is not pro-life , but anti·women under the cloak 
of libertarian rhetoric. It must be stressed that women's hard·earned 
rights must always be defended. for there are forces at work to put you 
back in the home to discourage your freedom in choosing your future 
lifestyle. To eliminate abortion as an option for women is anti·life, and a 
denial of the existence of the many women who died while receiving illegal 
abortions. While we sympathize with all struggles - the " big hassle" 
currently endured by these former UCSD students - we must be aware of 
a bigger hassle threatening all women in the future .

Ruby Starr: Almost a gem stage 
by Mikel Toombs 

Ana Writer 
Ruby Starr & Blackfoot. Wolfgang. Janu~ry9, 

1977, My Rich Uncles. 
L.A.'s Wolfgang is loved by a small but 

dedicated contiDBent oC San Diego rock'n'roll 
fans, and they are indeed a rather 10va~le b~nd. 
Not very good, certainly, but endeanng 10 a 
simplistic Angel/Kiss/Queen sort oC way. Their 
riffs hover around competence (save a totally 
uncalled-for drum solo), the lead singerl 
guitarist has his Freddy Mercury poses down 
pretty good and their use of the standard heavy 
metal vocabulary is impeccable ("this one's 
called ·Cyn-thi-UH"'). Other points in their 
favor: they don't overdue their imitation and 
their ' marketing techniques are humorously 
small-scale compared to the sales attack of the 
Kiss Army ("this is on our NEW FOURTY-
FIVE and there's ONLY ONE PLACE you can 
get it - over there behind the sound board") . 

Florida's Blackfoot is a good, solid Southern 
rock band. They are tight, have a couple oC good 
songs and are entertaining though not 
memorable. However, the arrival of Ruby Starr 
about four months ago has given them the 
something extra they sorely needed . Starr is 
clearly out to have Cun. She's almost always 
dancing and prancing about, playfully tossing 
around her abundance of flame-red curls. 
turning a cartwheel or two and pausing 
momentarily either to sing or to assume some 
cute pose, a couple fingers poised and pointed. 
She's flamboyant and yet graceful, a little bit 
Bette Midler-sleazy and quite a bit Ruby Starr-
sexy. 

And , oh yes, she can sing too. Beneath a 
pronounced, girlish Ozark Mountain accent she 
possesses a voice of surprising depth. Even 
when she's shouting (which is most of the time) 
she sounds very, vt:ry ~ood . Her showcase 
number is " Burnin' Whiskey," a tough, bluesy 
lament done up rock 'n'roll style with BlackCoot 
belting out powerful harmony, and then there's 
Denny Laine's "Time to Hide," the original 
version of which sounds like the group (Wings) 
is about to doze off - Ruby Starr & Blackfoot's 
rendition is so energetic I doubt if even Paul 
McCartney could sleep through it. 

The problem is that Ruby Starr doesn't seem 
to take herself very seriously onstage, only 
hinti ng a t the full range of her vocal ca pa bili ties . 
Especially disappointing : a half-hearted 
attempt at a straight blues number, cut short 
presumably in the interest of keeping the 
audience entertained. But that's what she's 
after and it works, so why complain, right... 

••••• 
Ruby Starr onstage and Ruby Starr offstage 

could almost be two different people. At the 
sumptuous College Travelodge Motel, a midway 
in a New Jersey to Southern California to 
Vancouver tour, her accent was subdued, she 
seemed mature and only a little crazy - and she 
was drowning a cold not in burn in' whiskey but 
in vitamin E . 

"I started singing at about the age of nine -
proCessionally, that is making money .. J started 
singing with a group in Dee-troit and just quit 
school and ran away to Dee-troit, and then went 
up to Chicago, worked with Curtis Mayfield ... 
that was about five years ago . .. 1 had one album 
out on Buddah ... and then 1 ran into Black Oak." 

And the rest, as they say, is history. Starr's 
most famous contribution to Black Oak (then 
Black Oak Arkansas) was backing vocals on the 
infamous "Jim Dandy," where her youthful 
exuberance played off against Jim Dandy 

Mangrum's usually overbearing macho stance 
to give the group their biggest hit . "They (Black 
Oak) like got Grey Ghost together for me ... Jim 
sorta looked around for musicians, we got on 
Capitol and we put one album out with Grey 
Ghost and then 1 went with Black Oak ... " Not 
many people took Starr 's first record too 
seriously, and if they did they probably weren't 
prepared for it. Rock'n'roH women have always 
found it almost impossible to get recognition-
there is currently only one widely-accepted 
group (HeartL fronted by hardrock ladies - but

Mariners "return" 
PHL hockey-puck stops here 

by S&eve Gould 
Spor1I EdU ... 

An announced Sports Arena 
hockey crowd of 3533 braved a 
torrential downpour last 
Saturday night to watch the San 
Diego Mariners drop a 6-2 
decision to the Phoenix 
Roadrunners. That's right, the 
San Diego Mariners. 

Wait a minute. Didn't the 
Mariners fold last April after 
hamburger king Ray Kroc lost 
over $1.5 million in one season? 
Right again. 

Confused San Diego hockey 
fans are asking themselves, 
" Who were those guys in 
Mariner uniforms Saturday 
evening?" The World Hockey 
Association Mariners did 
collapse last season. "Those 
guys" the other night were the 
San Diego Mariners ... of the 
newly formed Pacific Hockey 
League. Without changing the 
team name, logo or playing 
location , Sports Arena owner 
Peter Grahme has paid $400,000 
to enter the PHL Mariners in a 
four team league and keep 
hockey alive in San Diego. 

New Mariner general mana-
ger Bob Paine and Grahme 
have tried to disguise their PHL 
entry as the old Mariners, but 
not with much success. The 
team is called the Mariners but 
the similarities stop there. 

Last year, the WHA Mariners 
featured superstar Andre 
Lacriox, a hefty payroll and a 
berth in the semi-finals of the 
Avco Cup playoffs (the WHA 
equivalent to the Stanley Cup) . 
This year, the PHL Mariners 
feature the Long Beach Sharks, 
San Francisco Shamrocks and 
Phoenix as opponents, no name 
players and no affiliation with 
any NHL or WHA squad. 

The Major is a Minor 
San Diego entered the contest 

against the Roadrunners with a 
4-1 mark, second best in the 
league, only one point behind 
frontrunning San Francisco. 
Their 4-1 record dropped to 4-2 
as they were outskated , 
outchecked and outscored. At 
no time during the game did 
San Diego complete three 
consecutive passes or give airs 
that they were major leaguers, 
which is what the PHL is 
striving for. 

Lowlights during the evening 
included: 
-Play stoped at 16: 37 of the 

first period due to a rip in one of 
the goal nets, with the remain-
ing 3: 23 tacked on to the second 
period (atter a 15 minute 
break) . 

-Players from both teams 
fanning on shots and falling 
down UIlIUarded. 

-A weird beard contest 
between periods in which a 
spectator with the most bizarre 
facial growth receives $50. 

-Fans picking the three 
stars of the game, each of 
whom are awarded $25 gift 
certificates at a local men's 
store. 

- The P .A. announcer en-
couraging spectato'rs to bring 
airhorns, whistles and noise-
makers to games to distract 
opposing players and referees. 

Image from within 
The PHL is an Independent 

league based in Long Beach 
with teams in non-established 
hockey cities , San Diego 
included . Last year , the 
Mariners averaged around 6000 
paid per home game , well 
under the 10,000 needed to 
break even . Long Beach, 
Phoenix and San Francisco are 
not exactly pro hockey hotbeds. 
Four seasons ago, the Oakland 
Seals left the Bay area because 
turnstiles clicked infrequently, 
while the WHA Phoenix 
Roadrunners collapsed finan-
cially and Long Beach hockey 
fans need only to drive to the 
L.A. Forum to watch the NHL 
Kings : 

Mariner coach Butch Barber 
wa~ quick to agree the PHL is 
not bigtime ice hockey. " We're 
not the caliber ofthe WHA ," he 
observed. "San Diego's got 3000 
hardcore fans . With another 
5000 , this could become a 
hockey town. But right now, the 
fans don 't want to see 1-0 
games . They want and need an 
entertaining game." 

Despite the labeled minor 
league image, Barber says his 
team (and the PHL) " is doing 
everything to improve our 
image. " In his first year as a 
head coach after playing stints 
with Tidewater of the Southern 
League , the WHA Chicago 
franchise and Syracuse of the 
National American League; 
Barber knows the first season 
will be rough . "We've got 18 
guys who've never played 
together before. The PHL is on 
par with the WHA its first 
season." 

Tennis Tlp-s 

Glimmers of hope 
At times, the PHL Mariners 

looked like the WHA Mariners. 
Midway through the opening 
period, San Diego goalie Clay 
Hebenton, who had been given 
a l~ lead on Earl Sargent's 
third goal of the season, made 
five successive brilliant saves, 
bringing the crowd to its feet in 
roaring approval. Strong 
bodychecking by the defensive 
line of Dwayne Pentland, Mike 
Keeler and Reg Krezanski kept 
the Mariners in the game. 

Suddenly, the defense turned 
into a porous sieve, nobody 
seemed ready for a pass from 
his teammate and the short-
lived l~ lead became a 5-1 
deficit by the end of the second 
twenty minute stanza. Third 
period action was garbage time 
and the crowd cheered when 
the public address announcer 
gave the traditional " one 
minute left in the game" notice. 

The Mariners' roster reads 
like a conglomeration of hockey 
castoffs and college grad 
hopefuls . Next to the players' 

. names on the 28 page program 
(available for one dollar) is a 
column reading " 76-77 Team." 
A few Mariners boast affilia-
tion with WHA squads but the 
list is dominated by Tuscon, 
Winston-Salem , Baltimore, 
Fargo-Moorhead and Roches· 
ter. Coach Barber claims " no 
one on our team has a long term 
contract." Marginal players 
live with the constant fear of 
being cut . Where does one go 
after failing in the PHL? 

Under Grahme's wing 
Despite minor league status, 

the Mariners' management can 
feel safe financially. They need 
only draw 4100 paid per home 
game to break even (after four 
home dates, the attendance is 
just over 3500 per and Barber 
insists Grahme won' t call it 
quits again (Grahme closed his 
cash box for the WHA Mariners 
in 75-76 when he incurred heavy 
losses) . 

This Friday night at 8, the 
Mariners host San Francisco in 
the fifth home game of the 
young season. Rush end seats 
(behind the eastern goal) go on 
a first come-first served basis 
at 5 pm for just $2.50 . 

Spin to win 
TtlI' II the MCond In • _rIetI of 1e",,1t Upi wrtHen by Alex R_tIIIl, • tOIl pt.,-. on

In the volley as in any other stroke, we try to achieve the 
necessary speed and placement to win the point. But because we 
are positioned so close to the net, our time to execute a shot is 
greatly reduced. The novice will find it sufficient to merely block 
the ball, making use of the opponent's pace. But with experience, 
we want to add more - more pace and more accuracy. Greed 
comes with sophistication . ' 

To start with, take a larger swing, but a larger swing in the sense 
of the follow-through/ not the wind-up; takin~ the racket back t.oo 
Car behind the body aisturbs eye-hand coordmation. Try to meet 
the ball two to three feet in front of your body and follow through in 
the direction in which you want the ball to go. Now direction and 
pace has been added, but what will prevent the ball from drifting 
over the baseline or Into the net? 

The answer is in ball rotation -Cor volleys, backspin or underspin 
is used . Backspin is properly generated when we start our stroke 
slightly above the flight of the ball ; during actual contact firmly 
slide the rackethead down the back of the ball. Thus the proper 
volleying stroke involves a forward as well as a downward motion. 

This stroke is superior to the beginner's' 'punch" volley because 
it incorporates an extended contact period in which we hold the 
ball on our strings to better guide it into the opponent's court. In. 
reality, spin is not th(: means by which,we gain control but rath~r 
the byprO<1uct of a more dominating stroke. But don't fret over (niS 
seemingly vestigial angular momentum . A ball hit with sufficient 
backspin has the virtu of skidding rather than bouncing up. ThuS 
your opponent will find it nl'cessery to hit th ball up in order to 
have it clear the net. And you , of course, will tak dvanlage of 
your prev~()u . shot hy moving "on top oC the net' for the wmning 
pulaway.

Otber 
MClQorabilla 
When I first heard Fourth College's new name I was excited. 
That's because I didn't hear the names correctly. You see, I 

believed they had listened to my suggestion: I thought they had 
heeded the name most indicative of the college. I was of the opinion 
that they had taken the appelation of my choice. 

Naturally, I was wrong. 
Oh, they got the first name all right, but they erred overall. My 

choice? 
Earl Scheib College. 
Scheib, for those who were born yesterday, represents 

America's best. His smiling face can be seen from coast to coast 
adorning the lots of his famous "I'll paint any car for $49.95" car 
painting businesses. 

And imagine the student body. Why I'm sure Reg Rees would be 
only $49.95 a Quarter. More than that, the students could really get 
pre-professional training. Why a good car painter makes more 
than a mattress tester. 

Besides the practical aspects of being a car painting major, 
imagine the fun. Wouldn't you just love to get that spray paint can 
in your hands and go out and practice on the •. A" parking lots with 
those elegant silver Mercedes? Presto, shocking pink. And the 
gray BMWs. Oh, !et's say vermillion. And those metallic blue 
cadillacs? Easy. Canary yellow with tangerine trim. 

Now what you won't believe is that Earl Scheib didn 't even make 
the final cut when it came to selecting a name for Fourth College. 

He was number eleven on the list. 
An examination of the final ten names and the reasons 

attributed by the committees for their choices might reveal why 
Scheib didn 't make it. But Earl Warren instead? 

How El[8Iyn Wood 
Dynamics gives you a 
competitive edge in school. 

Committee name selections 
1) EARL WARREN COL-

LEGE - Reason: Well , there 
was this party where the 
committee sorta got plastered 
and we all thought how funny it 
would be ... 

2) GOD COLLEGE - Rea-
son: It was a strong early 
favorite since figuring we 
needed all the help we could get 
but then we reasoned that the 
students might get swelled 
heads ... 

School at any level means reading .. . lots of it. Keeping .up with 
thousands of pages can take a heavy toll in time and energy, and 
grades. If you ' re typical , you read 150 to 350 words a minute. But 
how do you get ahead of the rest? 

Evelyn Wood can triple your 
reading rate and improve your 
comprehension and study skills. 
Hundreds of thousands of students use the Reading Dynamics 
Method. They find reading less of a chore . Concentration and 
retention improve, which can lead to better grades. A competi-
tive edge is important . . . too important for you to delay. 

Prove it to yourself today! 
Whether you ' re thinking of grad school or the job market , or if 
you want to keep up with course reading today, let EVE:lyn Wood 
Reading Dynamics give you a competitive edge. 
In fact Evelyn Wood guarantees that you will triple your reading 
rate if you follow the course correctly , or your full tuition 
refunded . That's our competitive edge.

3) PROVOST LEA RUDEE 
COLLEGE - Reason: He said 
he 'd never have our jobs unless 
we voted for him so you can 
imagine ... 

4) CHANCELLOR WILLIAM 
McELROY COLLEGE -
Reason : He promised us 
Revelle College but then we 
came to our senses ... 

5) LEOPOLD COLLEGE -
Reason: An early favorite as 
being indicative of the student 
body, but the Loeb support split 
his votes ... 

6) UCSD COLLEGE -
Reason: Okay, okay, so we're 
not imaginative ... 

7) IMAGINATIVE COL-
LEGE - Reason: Lest any-
body think we're not imagina-
tive ... 

8) WOMAN COLLEGE -
Reason: We wanted to have a 
woman's name on the list so no 
one could accuse us of being 
sexist. .. 

9) NELSON ROCKERFEl-
LER COLLEGE - Reason: We 
almost decided on him when he 
offered us three million dolla rs 
but he. later lowered the figure 
two ...

ised to cover a news event for 
once ...
