SAN FRANCISCO - In 
addition to his $243,500 
university salary,UC Presi-
dent Jack Peltason earns over 
$100,000 by working as a 
part-time corporate director, 
according to a report by the 
San Francisco Examiner. UC 
Vice President Walter 
Massey earns $219,600 a year 
from the universit y, but 
boosts his salary by over 
$172,000 through corporate 
work. Several critics voiced 
concern over whether 
administrators commit 
enough time to their UC 
employment. "I wonder how 
an administrator in charge of 
this sprawling, great univer-
sity would have time to sit on 
all these boards," said State 
Sena.tor Tom Hayden (0-

Students at the Hastings 
College of Law in San 
Francisco are preparing 
arguments to gain representa-
tion on the University of 
California Student Associa-
tions (UCSA) board of 
directors and other UC-
systemwide committees, 
following statements from 
UC officials which said that 
tbe college was not a UC 
campus. The controversy 
began after Hastings' UCSA 
representative Dean 
Poulakidas dilc:oYered be 
would not be fully considered 
as a student regent candidate. 
According to UC spokesman 
Tom Debley, the law school 
is affiliated with the univer-
sity but does not operate 
under the Regents in the same 
way as the other campuses. 
Hastings College student 
identification cards display 
"The University of Califor-

college also offers official

PROTEST: Academic student 
employees stage a sit-in at 
chancellor's office to gain 
recognition for ASE 
By M ...... VIall 
Associate News Editor 
.... therMcR .. 
Guardian Reporter 

The ongoing conflict between the Associa-
tion of Student Employees (ASE) and the UC 
San Diego administration'came to a head Mon-
day when thirty five graduate students staged a 
sit-in at Chancellor Atkinson's office. The stu-
dents demanded a meeting with the chancellor 
to discuss recognition of ASE as the representa-
tive body for academic student employees. 

Though ASE was unable to speak to tbe 
chancellor on Monday, a meeting was sched-
uled for this morning at 8 a.m. "Our purpose in 
this m~ting will be to establish a relationship 
between the administration and our organiza-
tion that represents graduate student employ-
ees," said ASE staff member Scott Kessler. 

ASE, which was formed in 1989, is an orga-
nization of teache{S usistanls, resident assis-
lull, readers, tutors and adine instrudOrs. The 

administration has refused to recognize ASE as 
a representative of student employees despite 
the fact that the California Public Employment 
Relations Board (PERB) has already certified a 
majority interest for union representation among 
student employees. ASE card drives in 1992 and 
1993 showed thata majority ofstudent employ-
ees were in favor of union representation. Nor-
mally, proving majority interest would lead to a 
secret ballot election supervised by PERB that 
would decide which group would gain the right

Weapons Labs 
Squander 
Federal Funds 
REPORT: GAO study finds 
that UC labs are wasting 
millions of taxpayers' dollars 
By ErIk Johnson 
Senior Staff Writer 

The University of California nuclear weap-
ons labs are wasting more federal money with 
less oversight, according to the General Ac-
counting Office (GAO). 

The Oct. 19 GAO report stated' that the United 
States Department of Energy (DOE) is funding 
the university with $14 million for "unallowable 
costs" which are not covered in its contract, 
including penalties for criminal or safety viola-
tions. 

"The University of California has been al-
lowed to rip off the taxpayer," Rep. John D. 
Dingell (D-Michigan) wrote in a letter to Secre-
tary of Energy Hazel O' leary. Dingell also 
said, "[The] DOE has created for the University 
of California a fines and penalties slush fund." 
If the university does not spend the entire $14 
million of the "unallowable-costs" fund, it keeps 
the difference. 

The GAO report found that the DOE is losing 
oversight of the labs, citing a "dispute resolution 
clause" in the labs ' contract which allows them 
to challenge the applicability of DOE orders. 

According to congressman Dingell, the clause 
continues the practice of "mutual agreement" 
which he said has been central to DOE's long-
standing difficulties with the university labs. 

In addition, the report stated that the DOE 
agreed to only conduct "surpri~e" inspection.s 
after notifying laboratory management. 

Dingell also questioned the university 's cre-
ation of a $5 million dollar lab-administration 
unit to oversee the weapons labs and make them 
more financially sound. "One must wonder why 
the contractor should receive extra money to 
ensure that it is performing the tasks it was hired 
to do," Dingell said. 

In a separate report, the GAO found that 
DOE is funding pensions for lab employees at 
levels which far exceed those of federal em-
ployees, and that the deparmtent is losing its 
ability to control pension fund expenditures. 

Kuckuck said the pension issue is mislead-
ing because it is paid over a period of time, and 
added that because of the university 's prudent 
fund management, the Deparment of Energy did 
not make any contribution to the fund.

UCSD Agrees to Pay $608,000 for Job Discrimination 
EMPLOYMENT: 
Deparmcnt of Labor 
finds hiring violations 

, By .... DIIMdIIIII 
Senior StlItf Writer 

UCSD personnel offlCialiagreed 
to pay a settlement of over $608,000 
to 28 women and minority appli-
can .. and employees for hiring mal-
practicea. 

The agreement follows a two-
year probe by the U.S. Department 
of Labor which found that the uni-
venity violated federal hiri.., aad 

promotion practices. UCSD Chan-
cellor Richard Atkinson and federal 
labor offtcials siped the 12-page 
agreement .... week. 

"UCSD intends to operate a fair, 
open and equal- opportunity em-
ployment and promotion process," 
said Assistant Vice Chancellor for 
Human Reaoun:es Rogen Davis. 

Davis added, "In the cues iden-
tified by the Labor Department, 
UCSD inadequately documented 
and justified its selection process." 

The arrangement terms call for 
UCSD to follow through on several 
employ __ improvementainitiated 

by Atkinson last year, including 
improved managerial training, an 
overhaul of the grievance process 
and more extensive monitoring of 
hiring practices. , 

According to Woodrow 
Gilliland, a deputy direc:&or of the 
Department of Labor contract of-
fice in San Francisco, the results of 
the audit were conclusive. 

"That's what discrimination is, 
when you have people who are bet-
ter qualified than those who got the 
jobs and we can tie it to race and 
scx," Gilliland told TIte Stut Diego 
UIIioIt-1'ribww. 

The Department of Labor con-
tract office is heading the 
dispersement of th~ settlement be-
tween the 28 claimants. Officials 
estimate payments to range between 
$1,000 and $25,000 per person. 

Approximately $8,400 of the 
settlemen~ will be awarded to an 
Asian woman who was passed over 
for promotion in favor of a white 
male with less experience.

$9,000 in beck pay to three Latino

cal center who were paid 1ess than a

From SAAe Posts 
CONTRoVERSY: Craig charged with intentional 
misrepresentation and acting unprofessionally 
By NIM Bouahton 
Guatrllan Reporter 

Associated Students Vice Presi-
dent External Jennifer Craig elme 
under fire yesterday for allegedly 
lying, acting unprofessionally and 

. undermining several campus and 
intercampus positions as a 
representive of Stu-
dent Affirmative Ac-
tion Committee 
(SAAC). 

led the Executive Director of the 
UCSA Glenn Magpantay to believe 
that SAAC had formally endorsed 
the upcoming Student of Color Con-
ference. 

"[Craig) professionally lied about 
SAAC to the UCSA. That affects 
[SAAC's) reputation because she 

lied about an issue 
and was caught 
while she was a 
SAAC representa-
tive," Powell said. Craig, who was 

vice chair of Univer-
sity Center Advisory 
Board (UCAB) and is 
a four-year member 
of SAAC, has re-
signed as alternative 
representative to the 
UCSA and represen-
tative to UCAB. 

Nadina Powell, 
former acting SAAC 
chair, charged Craig 
with intentionally 
misinforming SAAC 
and the University of 
California Students 
Association (VCSA), 
and demanded that 
Craig be recalled as a 
SAAC. 

MI W..t to recall

Craig was also 
criticized for fail-
ingto identify her-
self as a SAAC 
representaive at 
several meetings. 
Roosevelt College 
representative to 
UCAB Gabriela 
Juarez said she 
never heard Craig 
refer to herself as 
the SAAC repre-
sentative at any of 
the UCAB meet-
ings which sbe at-
tended.

it for her own pur-
poses.

At the SAAC 
meeting yesterday,

alternative VCSA representative are 
why I believe [she) would misrepre-
sent SAAC to UCAB." 

Craig resigned from her posi-
tions prior to the SAAC meeting. 

Several people, including A.S. 
UCSA representative Naomi Falk 
and the SAAC representaive to the 
UCSA Damien Wilpitz, said they 
felt Craig undermined tbeir posi-
tions' at the UCSA Conference at 
Davis earlier this month. 

According to Wilpitz, Craig 
dominated conversations in which 
she should have only minimally 
participated. Falk said Craig fre-
quently contradicted her. 

Powell said that Craig had mis-

tricked Nadina into writing an ap-
proval letter so she that could go," 
Tesaksaid. 

Craig say she feels the charges 
are unjustified. 

"The issue is that there is a per-
ception that I wasn't doing my job. 
It doesn't matter iftbe [complaints) 
Ire justified, perception is reality, 
and I believe if one person thinks I 
wun't doing a good job, it' • .better 
for the committee if I just resign." 
Craig said. 

"I am frustrated that tbese 
people are my friends, and regard-
less of my past record with 
[SAAq, because of events that 
have happened in the past three 
weeks I am being recalled, " Craig 
added.

the stale and government at risk. 
MWe need some kind of insurance 
policy," he said. "We don't intend 
to incur those costs, but if we do and 
need to repay them, there's no fund-

Kuckuck said that flInd increases 
in the 1992 contract were results of 
new federal laws which have made 
it "much riskier to do business." 

To gain control over its contracts, 
the Department of Energy has pro-
posed changes in policy, including 
opening up laboratories to competi-
tion. 

The Department of Energy may 
decide as early as next year to open 
up the management of tbe labs to 
other contrsctors, which could com-

applicants were more qualified than 
those who were selected or pro-

californians Should 'Strike 
Out' Proposition 184 . 

Judging from popular opinion polls, crime in the United States has 
reached an all-time high. Killers, rapists and gang members, it would 
seem, are lurking on every street comer in every city in the nation. 
waiting to victimize John Q. Public. 

The perception of encroaching anarchy has prompted Americans 
to take up arms agamst violent criminals, and their weapon of choice 
has been the ubiquitous "three strikes-and-you 're-out" crime bill. In 
the last year, state and federal lawmakers haven't been able 10 pass 
these bills fast enough. 

On Nov. 8, Californians will have the opportunity to put yet 
another "three-strikes" law in the books. Proposition 184, though 
virtually identical to the recently passed AB 971, would unfortu-
nately do more than just duplicate the current law, it would embed 
"three strikes" into Califomia's legislative foundation. While a 
simple legislative majority can repeal AB 971, it would take a two-
thirds vote to overthrow Proposition 184 - something which 
Californians have every reason to avoid. 

Though Californians should fight to keep repeat violent felons off 
the street, the current law's goal of "striking out" every repeat, non-
violent offender in the state is not only morally bankrupt, it will drain 
the state of billions of dollars. 

The California Department of Corrections estimates that "three 
strikes" will double the state's prison population from 126,(8) to 
232,000 by the year 2000, which willlXlSt taxpayelS over 55 billion 
annually. In addition, according to prison officials, the exploding 
inmate population will require the state to build an additional 2S 
prisons, it currently has 28, at a price tag of $200 million each. The 
current "three-strikes" law is already pushing courts and prisons 
beyond their capacity. 

Ten years ago, California spent three percent of its annual budget 
on prisons; today it spends seven percent. In the next 10 years, we can 
expect this slice of the pie to grow even larger, as the state continues 
to "strike out" criminals - violent and otherwise. 

The result, of course, will be an increasingly tighter budget for 
state-funded services, including primary and higher education. Many 
Californians already receive marginal primary education, and many 
othelS are barred from UC and state colleges as a result of skyrock-
eting tuition and insufficient financial aid. Considering that each 
prisoner IXlSts the state over $20,000 per year - enough to provide 
nearly two full, UC scholarships, including food, transportation and 
recreation - the current "three-strikes" law will make these prob-
lems worse. Ironically, lack of educational opportunities and their 
resultant life chances is one important reason why state and national 
'crime rates are so high. 

But reason is often irrelevanttopolitia. Even our so-called fighter 
for education, Gubernatorial candidate Katheleen Brown, is a gong-
ho supporter of AB 971 and Proposition 184. However, as fear and 
loathing have become the central motifs of this year's elections, 
you'd be hard-pressed to find a major candidate who doesn't. 

Though violent crime is a major problem, "three strikes" is by no 
means a solution. As our nation's experience with crime attests, the 
threat of punishment alone - from imprisonment to death - does 
very little to lower crime rates. In fact, as sentences have become 
more severe and enforcement bas become more efficient, our prison 
population bas expanded. The United States has earned the unflatter-
ing distinction of having the world's largest prison population; and 
California has the highest in the nation. 

While we should fight for longer sentences for violent criminals, 
AB 971 and Proposition 184 's failure to distinguisb between "tbird-
strikers" convicted of selling marijuaqa and thale convicted of rape 
or murder, not only makes a mockery of justice, but forces an 
WlSightly future on California.

COMMENTARY: ht this age of trash talk, voters need to filter out media and 
political campaign gossip 
By ar.t JohMon 
St." Writer 

A political party, with the help of bundreds of re-
searchers, private investigators and mindless volunteers, 
uncovers Iwd-hitting information Ibout the opposing 
presidential candidate: As a student, she hid an affair with 
a Mongolian lirline steward. 

Next day on "Hard Copy," 
the story of the President's lech-
ery hits the nation like a punch. 
Speculation arises. Thcprcsident 
is a traitor - he revealed U.S. 
seems to a Chinese operative.

Public transit is not subsidized 10 the 
point that it can compete with the

Emnomically, our society supports 
the automobile over mass transit 

There are two ways to reverse this 
support. One way is to subsidize 
public transit, to make it less 
expensive than driving a car. The 
other is to decrease the subsidies to 
automobiles - for example, by 
forcing businesses and stores to 
charge for parlUng, or by substantially 
increasing gasoline taxes. If we do 
not direct funds toward improving 
urban transit, Califomians' need for 
automobiles will not decrease.

Worst of all, it drives people who

would force us to create an efficient,

It is well known that gasoline taxes 
are substantially higher in Europe; it 
is also well known that the quality of . 
European transportation is the best in

Proposition 181'sfundingofsome

Invariably, the receot immigrants

saying that this is necessarily a good 
thing; indeed, it is exploitative and 
unfair. 

Vaisman, however, claims that 
"[illegal] immigrants are just using 
the system to their advantage - they 
break the law and get IOIIIdhing for 
nothing." Nothing could be further 
from the truth. The California 
ecooomy is borne on1he hick of the 
cheap immigrant labor. If Vaisman 
were to leave this academic ivory 
tower and takeaIookatthe raJ people 
who come to this state from allover 
the world, she would raJize that all 
they want in return is a chance to lead 
the kind of lifestyle which she takes 
for granted. 

It is the responsibility of the

us to believe that wbitea are assuscep-
tible to I1IciaI discrimination as any 
mioority group. While he doan" end 
up makill8 much of an IIJUII'ICIIt for 
this notion of equal oppomanity rac-
ism, he does manage to spew this 
belligerent and ugly warning: to those 
committed to combating racism, be-
ware of raising the ire of "the white 
race." 

As a white male, I want to ada-
mantly and publicly reject Van 
Hoften's attempt to position me as 
just another victim of racism, and I 
hope my fellow white students at 
UCSD will continue to disavow such 
efforts to abIIolve us of the additional 
responsibility which c:omc. with our 
overwhelming sociaJ and economic 
advantage. 

Van Horten ICCUSCS the university 
of disseminating the -faJse" defini-
tio .. of racism proffered by Bishop 
Riehl Massaro. 

Van Hoften deems "incorrec:t" 
Massaro's view that racism is "the 
power individuals and groupsofone 
race use to systematically oppras 
those of another I'ICC." Aalording to 
Van Hoften, such a view is itself 
racist because it ignores "a constant 
display of black racism toward 
whites. " 

He cites IS an example of such 
black racism the movement by some 
black merchants in South Central 
LosAogckatodisaJuragewhiteown-
ership of businesses in their neigh-
borhood. Yet, the people of South 
Central just want to have a genuine 
llake in their oommunity. They are 
tired of seeing most of the revenue 
generated in this district siphoned 
out of it by merdaants and landlords 
who live elsewhere. The people of 
South Central are undertaking a mis-

sion of survival in 8dvocatin8 black 
ownership of their black neiahbor-
hoods. 

"While blacks may not be as in-
fluential as whites," Van Hoften 
mewls, '"they certainly have influ-
ence in a'UciaI apberes of society." 
Oaiming that the likes of Oprah 
Winfrey, Bill Cosby and Spike Lee 
areprooftbat"numerousblacbworlt 
in powerful positions," Van Hoften 
oonfusea cultural capital with real 
IIOciaI and eoonomic: power. Oearly, 
tIae and other blac:k en&ertaine11l 
have been able to provide us with 
many positive and prograsive im-
ages of black America, but their cul-
tural influence has hardly translated 
into more palpable oppomanities for 
blacks in geoeraJ. 

Van Hoften's failure to mention a 
single example of a "powerful" black 
penon outside the entertainment in-
dustry is a striking indic:aIion of just 
how ob&cured and disenfranchised 
blacks are in the United SCates today 
- although it's probIbly an even 
more striking indication of Van 
Hoften's cultural obliviousness. 

Indeed, when Van Hoften resorts 
to the dictionary to make sense out of 
a phenomenon IS complex and illu-
sive IS racism, it becomes pretty elear 
he's not quite ready to Iwim in the 
deep end of this issue. Rather than 
tinkering around with dictionary defi-
nitio.., Van HoRen ought to concern 
himself with redefining his own un-
derstanding of sueb concepts as 
"power," "opprasion" and "resp0n-
sibility. " 

Unlike Van Haften, • don't see 
the univenity's distribution of 
Massaro's views u an attempt to 
send white students on a collective 
pilt trip. But then Ipin, wilen it 
comes to I'IICial isIuea, I don't think 
'themajorityofuasufferfromaguilty 
CIOIIICience. 

• think IIlOIt of us pen:eive the 
university's adiona not IS an attempt 
to prOmote shame, defenaiveneas or 
"anger" among white studenIs, but as 
a all for introspection, c:andor and a 
genuine accepIIDCe of our important 
role in making this university a more 
indusive and attentive academic en-
vironment. 

While I would ipC with Van 
Hoften that "everyone is entitled to

FISHING: The 
wave of the future 
ContInued frem ..... SA 
Fishing, boring? Never, The wave 
of the future? Yell! 

BowliIIg: Okay, you've probably 
already caught lOme of those grip-
ping moments of the PBA tour, 
channel surfing between reruns of 
"Babewatcb" and a game on tbe 
Notre Dame network. You know 
what I mean: The bowler, clad in 
ugly pastels, powders his bands and 
looks meaningfully into the dis-
tance, concentrating and tben -
STRIKE! 

But that hQrriblc possibility, that 
cruel twist of fate exists in every 
match - the agonizing split! Holy 
hones, this is action! 'Ibis is excite-
ment! Tbis is events like "The 
Greater Rochester Open"! Bowling 
is a can't-miss opportunity, espe-
cially on television, 

Horst RGcing: You're thinking, 
"Horse racing?! That's not a sport!" 
Wrong, my good friend. It's in the 
sports section, Ergo, it must be. 
Sure, tbe jockey just sits there and 
goes for one heU of a ride, but it 
takes I certain talent to be that short. 
Plus, there's lots of money flying 
around in this business. 

It's not fair that it doesn't merit 
the coverage that otber boring sports 
get, sports in which you go around 
in cin:les for no reason, sueb u auto 
racing, Just because there's no bas-
ketball, doesn't mean you can't flip 
to a sports section with cool names, 
sucb u "Touch the Moon," "Bold 
Vilt" and "Mr. Fun." 

Folks, I opened the door to just 
three new sports for you. Think of 
bow many more deserve your atten-
tion. As tbe great inteUectual giant 
Andre Agassi once said, "I've only 
IICrltcbcd tbe iceburg." 

A world of sporting entertain-
ment and amazement is just wait-
ingforyourinterat, It'ssadtbatyou 
can't hear the craclt of a bat or IIOC 
the speed of a slaplbot this season, 
but who cares? I don't. I've got 20 
bucb on "Mr, Fun" to win in the 
fourth race.

The UCSD GuardiaD 

., ....... 
Co-Sports Editor 

On Oct. 9, 1992, Bill C1inkm wu 
a montb away from being elected 
to tbe White House, OJ. Simpeon 
wu just a mediocre sideline reporter 
and Ru-Paulstill bad a career. Db 
yes, and tbat wa tbe lat time the 
UCSD women's soccer team lost a 
regulu-season pme. Since that day, 
a 2-0 defeat to arch-rival Cal 
Lutheran, the Tritons bave not lost 
a regular-season game in '34 con-
tests. 

Along the way, the Tritons have 
gone 5-0-1 in games against Divi-
sion I teams, 4-Q-2 against Division 
II teams and a perfect 16-0-0 ver-
sus Division III teams. And mOlt of 
those games haven't even been 
close. UCSD has notched 24 shut-
outs over this span and outscorcd its 
opponents 115-13. No, that's not a 
misprint, the Tritons really do have 
102 more goals that their competi-
tion. 

This season, UCSD has contin-
ued its run by compiling a lO.()-3 
record going into this Sunday's fi-
nal contest at Chapman University. 

The Tritons' success seems aU 
the more remarkable once you've 
heard Head Coach Brian McManus' 
philosophy on the regular season. 
"The season really starts after the 
Chapman game. You need to look 
at the big picture ... tbe regular sea-
son is always just a warm-up for the 
playoffs," he said. 

But on the other hand, "The

regular season isn't unimportant, it's 
just less important than the 
regionals, "Triton junior Carin Pugh 
said. "But [McManus) makes sure 

that we stay focused on every game. 
Even if it's supposed to be an easy 
game, we go into it like every pme 

See STREAK, Page 13 

Thunda)" October 27,1994 

STREAK: Triton

is the hardest one we'll play this 
year." 

While McManus is responsible 
for some of the team's winning, he 
is the first one to Idmit that his play-
ers arc the 0Il0l who deserve the 
IDOIt credit. 

"We've got players who really 
want to play. ThiI isn't a Division 
UI program, " McManus said. "Play-
ers come here for the lademics, not 
because its Division III. AllIS play-
ers on our roster could play for a 
Division I team somewhere." 

This brings up the recruiting fac-
tor. McManus attnets players to 
UCSD who know that, if they are 
good enough, they will be playing 
regardless of their age. This year 
freshmen, such a Beth Freeburg 
and Maricela Oceguera have be-
come defensive anchors for the Tri-
tons. Lilt year as a fresbman, 
sopbomore Ele Johnson tied for the 
team lead in points, while Pugb was 
second in team scoring her freshman 
year. 

"No matter bow good of a coach 
you are, you can never make bad 
players into good ones. We succeed 
because we have good players," 
McManus said. 

The players believe not so much 
in their skill a in some iDtangibles. 
"We have a lot of heart and that sees 

us through a lot of pmes," senior 
Daphne Farnum said. 

"Heart and unity," junior Diana 
Mucbowski agreed. "Wo've got a 
lot of skill, but You can only do so 
much with skill. On this team, ev-
eryone plays for the team, instead 
of just for themselves. And our heart 
is what gets us through when we're 
down by one and time is runniog 
out." 

Beyond the intangibles, the Tri-
tons have also found themselves 
with a deep bench which bas helped 
them through a tough year for inju-
ries. UCSD suffered a rash of ail-
ments at the start of the season and 
didn't practice with a full squad un-
til the fourth week of the year. 

"Because of our good bench, 
everybody really stepped up when 

The U(;SV Guardiaa 

we bad aU those injuries and did 
tbeir jobs," Farnum said. 

As for the unbeaten streak, the 
Tritons seem relatively unconc:erncd 
about the hype which comes with 
such sua:eu. "It's not really that im-
portant, because if you focus too 
much on that, you get overconfi-
dent, " Pugh said. 

But Muchowski sees the streak 
in an entirely practical light: "Other 
teams can get in with six losses be-
cause tbey win their conference. 
(Because we're not in a conference,) 
we have no alternative." 

Despite the success of the last 
couple of years, the team is not 
ready to rest. on its laurels. "This 
streak is nice, but if we don't win 
six more games, it doesn't mean a 
tbing," McManus said.

My Money is 
On Mr. Fun UCSD Terminites Anteaters, 4·1 

Sometimes it's possible to 
slall on the highway of life. I 

t. . mean, it happens to the best of 
us. You ' re cruising along, 
enjoying the scenery, and then 
- BOOM! - you have a 
blowout or you hit a speed 
bump. 

I. 

It's these times - these 
boring moments when there's a 
lull in the action - when you 
should take a look back, and 
see what exit ramps you 
missed. 

The same can be said about 
the wonderful world of sports. 
You see, there 's definitely a 
lack of action right now. If you 
don't think so, read the front of 
the Union-Tribune's sports 
page. You'll see all kinds of 
interesting articles about 
Bobby Ross' favorite tooth-
paste, in-depth analysis on 
nifty sports like ice skating and 
reports on the 1947 World 
Series ... wrillen by a guy who's 
probably dead by now. 

Call me a dumb dog, but 
there's something wrong here. 
No baseball. No hockey. I'm 
sure some American men are 
wondering when they're going 
to take away G.I. Joe action 

... figures. I mean, it's gelling 
that serious. 

. , 

So, like the good patriot I 
am, I'm going to tell you what 
your sportsminded focus needs 
to be in these rough times. You 
can think of me as a sports 
guru, a guardian of the games, 
a Confucious of competition 
- or just as a guy who's 
watched too many episodes of 
the "A-Team" and thinks 
George Peppard should have 
gotten an Emmy for distin-
guished service. 

In any case, looking back I 
realize that many sports 
haven't gollen their 15 minutes 
of fame. Perhaps in this new 
era of nothing, they deserve 
top billing. I'm talking about...

DEMOUTION: Tritons 
teach Division I UC 
Irvine a lesson in 
humility Wednesday 
By Brian K. Hutto 
Senior Staff Writer 

After relinquishing an uncharac-
teristically high six losses in the sea-
son, Head Coach Derek 

Armstrong's 
Triton men 's 
soccer team 
(11-6-1) has 
found itself in 
a desperate 
struggle to 
impress the 
traditionally 
u nforgiv i ng 
NCAAselec-
tion commit-
tee. 

"We need 
something to prove to the commit-
tee that this team belongs in the 
playoffs," Armstrong said after last 
week's 3-2 double-overtime loss to 
Division I USD. "We thought we 
were going to get it today, but IMne 
may be the scalp we're looking for. " 
Armstrong's wish was the TritOns' 
command. Yesterday, UCSD upset 
Division I powerhouse UC Irvine in 
style, coasting to a definitive 4-1 tri-
umph. 

UCSD knew this was going to 
be a test. The Anteaters started out 
the season 8-1. But Irvine had hit 
some recent potholes, going 3-4 
over its last seven games, including 
a 4-3 overtime loss to Cal State Ful-
lerton. 

"They are not a pretty soccer 
team," Armstrong said. "But they 

win with scrappy goals 
and hard play. This was 
a good result for us." 

The Tritons struck 
first blood at the 20:57 
mark. Midfielder Jose 
Ocampo controlled the 
ball near the right side-
line just inside the Ant-
eaters' half of the 
midfield. Teammate 
Nate Hetherington sped 
by on Ocampo's right, 
but the sophomore's pass 
was intercepted by 
Irvine defender John 
Houston. However, 
Ocampo stubbornly 
stayed with it, ducking to 
the left and snatching 
Houston 's forward pass 
at midfield. 

The Anteater's de-
cided to give Ocampo a 
little room to play, and 
they got burned, as 
Ocampo uncorked a vi-
cious spinning bomb 
shot from 25 feet out. 
Irvine goalkeeper 
Mathew Goldman found 
himself grossly out of 
position and could only 
watch as Ocampo's shot 
spun into the back of tbe 
cage, giving UCSD an 
early 1-0 advantage. VIIIGWlGIDIaIIv/GuMIIn 

"Number three [Jeff K. CIIrIItopher ',... (top) ....... UCID' ..................... 1. trUnpII. 
Fischbeck) kept taunting me,-
Ocampo recalled. "'It was number 
three's fault; if be wan't taunti .. 
me, I might not have .hot it at all.· 

The Tritons were extremely glad 
he did. UCSD managed only one 
more shot on goal the rest of the 
half. But San Diego's defensive 

corps lived up to its end of the bar-
gain, stifling Irvine's offensive jug-
gernaut P.J. Polowski (18 goals, 8 
assists) and teammate Adel 
Aflwian. 

"We matched those two up pretty 
good," Armstrong said. "Any good 
player is going to get their chances, 

but [Newcomer] 
and [Yen] did a 
goo4 job of shutting 
those two down. I 
knew our forwardS 
could handle their 
defense if we could 
just shut down 
those two." 

True to 

raced over to fill tbe gap, forcing 
Fong to move further left. With all 
the attention focused on Fong, 
midfielder Erik Waldman sliced 
throuab to the left comer of the pen-
alty box. A Fong tap-pass later saw 
Waldman pocket a left comer rocket 
to put UCSD up 2-0. 

Its Division I pride wounded, 
Irvine lashed back less than a 
minute later. Polowski drilled a free 
kick on the right side, 20 feet away 
from the Triton cage, and teammate 
Manny Hernandez tapped the ball 
to Afbrian in front of the UCSD 
goal. Although goalkeeper George 
Allison stopped tbe first shot, 
Afkarian stayed with the rebound, 
pushing it into tbe net to lessen the 
gap to 2-1. 

..-- Well , while you're still 
revelling in that statistic, think 
to yourself: Did you know that 
at Oceanside, fishermen reeled 
in 55 mackerel yesterday? 
Amazing, isn 't it? Just think . 
how popular you 'd be at work, 
passing around witty banter 
such as, ~You know, Bob. 
They caught 75 calico bass at 
Seaforth yesterday." Ocean

THEATER PREVIEW 
-

TbeatreSports 
Improvisational acting troupe provides a continual challenge for its founders 

• 
By John Godfrey 
Staff Writer 

In the last half-century, theoreti-
cians have expanded the boundaries 
of theatrical performance by draw-
ing a systemaliccomparison between 
the types of performative behavior 
common to both theater and sports. 
Through analysis qf certain com-
monalities, these theorists posit, 
key structural elements can be iso-
lated and explored in the narrative 
construction of both media. 

La Jolla TheatreSports doesn't 
bother with any of that. The improv 
troupe just wants to make you laugh. 

This Sunday, the ensemble inau-
gurates its 1994-95 season with an 8 
p.m. performance at 409 Small, 
UCSD's Studio Theatre space lo-
cated next to the new Visual Arts 
complex. The 9O-minute perfor-
mance will feature two teams of 
UCSD graduate actors competing to 
outdo one another in a series of brief, 
audience-generated comedy 
sketches. 

If La Jolla TheatreSports sounds 
like the British television series 
"Whose Line Is it Anyw.y?" it 
should. Both programs share the no-
tion of competitive improv, but as 
TheatrcSports co-Artillic Director 
Kent Davis points oul, the promise 
of .udience participation gives the

live event an advantage over the liv-
ing-room experience. 

"What we're doing is live," Di vis 
said. "When you're watching 'Whose 
Line .. .' on TV you have no control 
over what happens. At all. If you 
come to TheatreSports you can sit in 
the audience and yell and scream 
.and be a part of the event. 
TheatreSports is much more partici-
patory." 

Indeed, audience members playa 
crucial role in every TheatreSports 
production. At tbe beginning of each 
performance, the audience is asked 
to write down a selection of nouns, 
verbs and adjectives which the ac· 
tors later use in the context of their 
performance. There are I variety of 
games in the show, but in each sketch 
the .ctors blve to tbink on their feel 
(and in front of an audience) to make 
sense out of potentially nonsensical 
scenarios. 

"We take suggestions that are 
crazy .nd insane .nd completely un-
connected," Davis said, "and through 

7&80 

the theater games we create. narra-
tive out of them -live. in front of an 
audience." 

Davis, fellow co-Artistic Direc· 
tor Francine Torres and the entire . 
ensemble of La Jolla TheatreSports 
are graduate students in UCSD's .c-
c1.imed MFA Professionll Theatre 
Training Program. Each studentlc· 
lor possesses • considerable amounl 
of professionll savvy, lechnical skill 
and stage experience. And 
TheatreSports scares Ihe hell out of 
all of them. 

"/I's like strapping I bomb to 
your chest and doing free-fall with-
out a parachute," Davis said. "Dasi· 
cally, you ue standing up on stage, 
pulling your pants down and saying 
to theaudience, 'Hey! Laugh at me!' 

"And you know," he added, ".Iot 
of limes they're not going to I.ugh." 
Yetbotb D.vis and Torres have been 
doing improv work for years, Ind 
they keep coming bade for more. 
"It's I total adrenaline rush," D.vis 
explained. 

"There's no planning, there's no 
notbing. It's like candy for your 
imaginalion, and it is such I rush to 
make people laugh. That's why I do 
it. "

Love 
Affair 
Female 

performances 
carry remake 
of1939film 

By CIIIKIn Simmons 
Guardian Reporter 

Dreamy music, fantastic settings, 
a seemingly doomed love affair and 
a happy ending are the elements that 
make for a box-otrJCe hit - just 
consider last year's romantic com-
edy Skepkss in Seanle. Love Af-
fllir, the second remake of writerl 
director Leo McCarey's 1939 film, 
conti nutS this suc:cessful formula of 
romantic comedies while retaining 
theold-fashionromanc:eoftheorigi-
nal movie. 

Annette Scning is both vulner-
able and strong u Terry McKay, an 
engaged woman who faIls in love 
with ex·footbaU star Mike Gambril 
(Warren Beatty, who also produced 
and c:o-wrote the film), who is also 
engaged. 

Ulte her predocesIIor Deborah 
Kerr (who played Terry.in the 1957 
version An Affair to Remember), 
Scniog exudes cIau and wit. Though 
the storyline wu already a c:Iic~ by 
1957, Bening makes it believable 
for a '90s audience. She portray. 
Terry as a strong-willed, yet tender 
cbaracter whom female audience 
members can appreciate. 

I n what cou Id be her last featpre-
movie appearance, Katherine 
Hepburn delivers a stellar perfor-
mance as the frail Aunt Ginny. An 
intriguing chemistry emerges be-
tween Hepburn and Bening during 
their brief encounter, making it one 
of the best scenes in the film. 

Unfortunately, Beatty, known for 
his roles in critically acclaimed 
movies sucb as Bugsy and Bonnie 
andelylk, fails to portray Gambril's 
charm. Beatty's expressionless,stoic 
performance simply leaves -the au-
dience cold. 

The lighting and the scenery, 
however, are the real stars of Love 
Affair, TheluminoussbotsofBening 
and Beatty, the panorami~ scenes of 
Tahiti, and the exquisite image of 
Bening with the Empire State build-
ing reflected beside her in a window 
were some of the movie's most 
memorable moments. They added a 
retro, almost film-noire atmosphere 
to Love Affllir.

POETRY READING PREVIEW ~ 

Oral Traditions 
Evening oj spoken-word performances will celebrate ethnic heritage 

ByToma.tdly 
S,.ffWrlrw 

"Oral Traditions," an upcoming 
spoken-word and poetry-reading 
session sponsored by Eleanor , 
ROosevelt College, will provide a 
forum for creative expression from 
a cross-section of cultures in the 
United States. 

Angela Boyce, president of tbe 
Mtican-Americ:an Student Union, 
along with UCSD student Alycia 
Bstiacla, and Resident Assistants Eli 
Alvarado ofIntemational House and 
Nadina Powell of Roosevelt, will 
host the event from 7-11 p.m. on 
Fri4ay at Pepper Canyon '5 Fireside 
Lounge. 

"The idea behind 'Oral Tradi-
tions' is to target the different cul-
tural systems wit~j'n North 
America, "Boyceexplained. "We're 

WHO: ·Oral Traditions· 
WIIIN: Fri., Oct. 28, 7 p.m.

trying to get broad-based represen~ 
tltion." Mrican American, Chicano 
and Native American poets will read 
their work. 

"A lot of people of a>lor have 
[oral traditions]," added Bstiada. 
"Latinos, Mrican Americans, Asian 
Americans and Native Americans 
have that passed on from generation 
to generation ... 

Alvarado hopes to both "create a 
forum for people who usually are 
not included in the dialogue," as 
well as "try to provide an opportu-
nity for the international ,tudents 

who live here to hear those voices 
and participate." 

Boyce said she gained inspira-
tion for the event in January while 
doing her first poetry performance 
on MlV'sspoken-word tour. "I met 
so many people there who were 
ready to just tear out their souls for 
people in the audience," she said. "I 
wanted to design a set of readings 
for people not published - to try to 
do something informal yet tied to 
indigenous forms of transmitting 
history orally. That's why it's called 
'Oral Traditions. ,,, 

Then, wbile performing at 
Lollapalooza's spoken-word tent, 
Boyce explained, "I met people in 
the community interested in doing 
that sort of circuit work." A spoken 
word presentation called "Speaking 
For Change," organized by UCSD 

literature students last year, also 
motivated Boyce. 

"On I Traditions" will feature 
mostly UCSD students, but will also 
include others from the San Diego 
Ue&. Besides Boyce, UCSD poets 
who will read include Olen Wilson, 
Anthony Navarelli, Monica Yanez, 
Nydia Sanchez and Alfredo Ferrah. 
Poets from tbe a>mmunity include 
D, Reynolds, Antonio Martin, Ci· 
pher Fitzpatrick, John Partido and 
Nomo Collective. Victoria Eagle 
Magyar, the: winner of 
Lollapalooza's spoken-word con-
test, will also perform, An open mike 
session will follow the perfor-
mances. 

Boyce sees spoken word as "a 
good way for people to voice their 
opinions about the world as they see 
it. Everyone has their own uniquely 

formed viewpoints. It's very inspi-
rational to listen to other people deal 
with day-to-day crises." 

Boyce said she hopes that this 
"new way of doing literature" will 
be well-received by UCSD students, 
"It's widely a coffee house thing," 
she said, "I thought it would be 
popular among students, especially 
those interested in literature." 

"We feel it is important for us not 
only to communicate to our people, 
but to students and the public in 
general," agreed Estiada. Although 
still unsure whether she will per-
form, Estiada is considering read-
inga poem about what she sees as an 
i m portlnt Latina issue. "I tell a story 
of a woman who falls in love and 
ends up alone with a baby after the 
man who once claimed to love her 
leaves her," she said.
