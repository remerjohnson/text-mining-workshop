New. Edlt", 

Complete silence greeted the 
announcement yesterday evening 
in the pub that Maynard Dimmes-
dale had won the election for 
A.S. President, receiving 62.6 
percent of the vote to rival Johnny 
Patterson's 37.4 percent. 

Virtually the only people 
present to hear the announcement 
by election manager Kei Sellers 
were members ofthe Team Unity 
slate, of which Patterson was a 
member. Nine of them had won 
their respective A.S. races . 
Dimmesdale was not in the pub 
at the time. 

"I think I did so well because a 
lot of people want to see a 
change," Dimmesdale said. 
"Hoping for a good candidate to 
come by isn't really enough, they 
[students] have to vote for the 
candidate. " 

1490 of them did vote yester-
day, and Dimmesdale collected 

Above, Maynard Dimmesdale, the new AS President, said that he was surprised at the turnout in the 
bad weather. Below, members of the AS await the results of the run-off election in the pub last night. 

Judicial Board decision ' 

Crabtree receives probation 
for rest of school career 
By CYNTHIA CHESY 
Stt4IJ W,lt~' 

The charge against Kristin 
Crabtree of assaulting a police 
officer was dismissed on Tuesday. 
However, the possession of a 
dangerou weapon charge has 
left Crabtree on disciplinary 
probation for the rest of her 
academic career at UCSD. 

A public statement of the 
decision came at a pre s con-
ference given by rabtree in front 
of the American Civil Liberties 

Union building downtown. 
Crabtree called the decision to 
drop the assault charges by the 
Third College Judicial Board "a 
wonderful victory," but plans to 
appeal the charge of possession 
of a dangerous weapon, feeling it 
is not fair . 

The charges again t Crabtree 
were filed by the University after 
she attended a lecture given by a 
Contra representative last Nov-
ember. 

According to the UCSD police 
report Crabtree "ran toward a 
peace officer ... attempted to kick 

him but was grabbed by another 
peace officer." This allegedly 
occured, according to the report, 
during a scuffle onstage involving 
another UCSD student, Arnie 
Shoenberg who approached the 
speaker but was grabbed by a 
peace officer before Shoen berg 
reached him. 

The report also stated that 
"metal knuckles" were found 
attached to Crabtree's keychain 
during a subsequent frisking 
which lead to the possession of a 
dangerous weapon c_harge.

921 votes, while Patterson, who 
lost all four colleges, received 
only 550. 19 people did not cast 
their ballots in the presidential 
race. 

Tom Rhee was "excited" that 
he beat Rick Mersereau out for 
A.S. Public Relations Commis-
sioner handily, 802 to 467, but he 
was unhappy with Guardian 
coverage of the elctions. 

"I felt the Guardilln was unfair 
for a paper that commits itself to 
professionalism," Rhee said. "I 
hope in the future that the 
Guardian presents both sides of 
every issue. " 

Rhee cited as a specific example 
of this "unfair" behavior the 
failure of the Guardian to print a 
letter written by outgoing A.S. 
President Dave Marchick that 
endorsed Patterson. (ed. note: 
While this paper received the 
letter. there are two retuons it 
was not printed: the leiter came 
in Friday after noon. past the 
deadline; it was received after the 
Opinion section was finished.) 

In thFthir4~coAle$l.Cd.. 
for Revellelunior Senator, Greg 
Olavarria defeated Mary A. 
Fisher 54.9 percent to 45. J 
percent. 

Patterson, who picked up 1522 
votes in the last election, 185 
short of victory, was gracious in 
defeat. "I wish things would have 
happened the other way," he 
said. ". tried as hard as I could ." 

Dave Marchick was asked if 
he thought the members of 
Patterson's slate would cooperate 
with Dimmesdale over the next 
year. "Definately," he said. "I 
think the people he's elected with 
are outstanding." 

Marchick's first reaction to 
the news of Dimmesdale's victory 
was one of surprise. "My God, 
that's incredible," was his re-
sponse when told of the results. 
"I think that it's a surprise and 
that obviously Maynard was 
talking about issues that were 
important to the students." 

Dimmesdale agreed. "I am a 
bit surprised. I didn't expect quite 
as large of a turnout, especially 
considering the weather," he said. 

Both Marchick and Dimmes-
dale felt that Tuesday's debate 
on the plaza between the candi-
dates was an important factor in 
Patterson's defeat. 

"Listening to him yesterday 
[at the debate], he really pointed 
out a lot of things the A. S. didn't 
do well this year, " Marchick said, 
hastening to add that the A.S. 
"did do a lot of good things." 

"I think the debate went very 
much in my favor, and I was very 
happy the elections committee 
set it up," Dimmesdale said. 

Third Junior Jackie Jeffrey 
said at the debate that she "didn't 
know much about the candidates 
lnd I thought Dimmesdale had a 
much stronger voice for the 
students as a whole. Dimmesdale 
was more cultural where Johnny 
was more popular." 

"It [the debate] was really 
helpful, and 1 thought Dimmes-
dale was really good," said 
Revelle junior John Harrington. 

"Patterson didn't really look 
like he knew what he was talking 
about and Maynard did," said 
Warren sophomore Christopher 
Ross. "I think it was really good 
to see how really qualified 
Maynard is."

By CHRIS HAMSON 
St~Wrltn 

Under a ' proposed policy to 
create a smoke-free environment 
on campus, smoking in virtually 
every indoor area and the sale of 
cigarettes and other smoking 
material would not be permitted. 
Only private residential space, 
such as the dorms, would be 
excluded from the policy. 

The policy was formulated, 
and is still under consideration, 
by the UCSD Smoking in the 
Workplace Committee, which is 
soliciting comments about the 
proposal through April 15. 

All UCSDfacilities, regardles 
of location, would be regulated 
by this policy with the exception 
of UCSD Medical Center which 
already ha a smoking policy. 

"The committee wa formed 
a a re ult of a systemwide 
directive from the president that 
each UC campus have a-smoking 
policy in place by July," com-

Two UCSD engineers elected to 
National Academy of Engineers 

Two engineers affiliated with UCSD have recently 
been elected to membership in the National 
Academy of Engineering (NAE). 

The two professors are James U. Lemke, an 
executive with Eastman Kodak Co., and adjunct 
professor with the Center for Magnetic Recording 
Research, and Forman A. Williams, Robert H. 
Goddard Professor of Engineering at Princeton, 
who will be returning to UCSD in the fall. 

Election to the NAE is considered one of the 
highest honors which can be conferred upon an 
engineer, and the two latest elections brings UCSD's 
total membership in the organization to nine. 

Lemke is among the world's leading experts in the

April 24-30 named National Eating 
Disorders Awareness Week 

The week of April 24-30 has been designated by 
the United States Congress as National Eating 
Disorders Awareness Week (EDA W). 

The incidence of eating disorders is a major health 
problem which has increased over the past several 
years. Although much has been written and 
publicized about anorexia nervosa (self-starvatio~), 
bulimia nervosa (binge-purge cycle), and compulSIve 
overeating, many do not realize the life-threatening 
effect these disorders can have on individuals and 
families of those effected. 

Young women appear to be at the hightest risk, 
but young adults and men are also affected . 

The purpose of EDA W is to promote.a level of 
public understanding of eating disorders that will 
result in compassion, rather than judgement or 
rejection of people currently engaging in eating 
disorder related behavior and enable earlier iden-
tification and improve chances for recovery. 

To obtain additional information on the week's 
activities, call 546-4332. 

UCSD Theatre dept. to stage "Plays 
in Progress Festival" April 20-23 

Three plays in progress written by graduate 
students in UCSD's Department of Theatre's 
Professional Theatre Training Program will be 
performed at 8 pm in the Warren Theatre from

of the Hold-On Man," and "Ty and Jay," and will 
be acted, directed and staged by students in the 
Master of Fine Arts program, according to 
department chair and playwright Adele Edling 
Shank. The two short plays will be presented on 
April 21 and 23. 

One of the shorter works, by Daniel Camacho, 
titled "Who's Got a Hold of the Hold-On Man," is a 
story about a Chicano man's fight with his own mid-
life sexuality and machismo. 

Also on April 21 and 23 is "Ty and Jay" which 
was written by Michael Erickson and directed by 
Maria Mileaf. It is a play about two young men, 
disillusioned by their status in a world where others 
are getting ahead. 

Reid JeDlCn'l play, "Public Image Limited," is a 
full-lel1Jlh production which will be staged on April 
20 and April 22, and is directed by Todd Salovey. 
The play tells how the lead character, Aaron, must 
search for his missing father, who is a fugitive. The 
search takes place in a setting sometime in the 
future, where the government can change people's 
identities without notice or consent.

Crabtree 
Hearing 
Continued rrom pap I 

Both Crabtree and Shoenberg 
were detained after the incident, 
searched, and sent away, but the 
Univenity only pressed charges 
against Crabtree. 

According to Crabtree, the 
policeman attacked her and 
during the search they found a 
device to be used for self-defense 
that she bouaht in case of a rape 
situation. 

Luis Ramirez, Third Colle,e 
Dean, received the assault and 
possellion charges a,ainst 
Crabtree from Nicholas Aguilar, 

Campus Student Conduct Co-
ordinator. During the initial 
phase of the alleged violations, 
Ramirez i.sued .anctions against 
Crabtree, which she did not 
accept. Crabtree called for a 
hearing, and the charge of 
possession of a dangerous wea-
pon remains as a result of that 
hearing. 

Dean Ramirez accepted the 
board's decision and recom-
mendations for sanctions last 
Wednesday and notified Crabtree 
that she is on "disciplinary 
probation for the duration of her 
undergraduate .tay at UCSD" 
and ordered her to complete "30 
hours of community service," 
Crabtree said. 

"The Univenity is preventing 
me from doing anything on 
campus," Crabtree said.

Hunter S. Thompson 
Here comes Jesse 

Some of the best minds of our ,eneration have been followin, this presidential capaign about 20 hours a day for three years, and they have not come up with much wisdom. They were 
stunned by Geoge Bush's blitzkrei, for the GOP nomination and 
now they are weeping and jabbering like chimpanzees at the baffling 
phenomenon of Jesse Jackson. 

On the eve of the terminally critical New York primary, nobody in 
politics seems to have any idea what will happen when the votes are 
counted. or even who will win. The only question left on the 
Republican side is how much longer Bush wants to gnaw the skulls of 
his dead enemies - but the Demo race has been intolerably strange 
from the start and is beginning to look even stranger. With the 
nominating process two-thirds finished and closing fast, the only 

, remaining contenders are a humorless Greek from Massachusetts 
and a radical black preacher from Chicago who has called New York 
City "Hymietown" and still expects to win the state. 

There is a powerful element of craziness at work here, and it has 
left the experts in ruins . The winner of the New York primary will be 
the frontrunner for the Democratic Party's nomination all the way 
down the home stretch, and the loser will instruct his most trusted 
staff people to start making notes and taking names for the 1992 
campaign. There are 275 delegates at stake here, but the larger prize 
is the perceived shift of weight and momentum that will alter the 
outcome ofthe final few big primaries, in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas 
and finally, California. The image of a winner on TV is worth about 
33 percent in the stretch. 

New York is not like New Hampshire, where history guarantees 
that the loser will not go to the White House but the winner in New 
York will definitely be a player at the convention, and that is called 
"victory" in the politics busi nes~ Only California is bigger, and 
anybody who wins both of these will probably be the nominee. 

D espite this huge weight and importance that has been worth millions in high-tech research and fees to prestigious polling firms , the outcome in New York remains a hopeless mystery 
24 hours before the vote, and the consensus among experts is that the 
deciding factor will be whether or not it rains . 

Jackson's people don't care about rain, they say. Foul weather will 
only make them angrier and more determined to vote. A monsoon 
would be better. and a murderous hailstorm would almost guarantee 
a Jackson victory . .. But if the day dawns bright and sunny, hordes of 
yuppies will turn out in jogging shorts and Reeboks to vote for 
Dukakis. Any gloom on the morning weather report could change 
the outcome by 10 or 12 percent. 

The conventional wisdom says the prospect of a brokered 
convention is d im. Not since the advent of massive TV coverage in 
the '50s has either party let its process go beyond the first ballot. Once 
Teddy White and the Four Horsemen of NBC got involved, there 
was no more privacy in the back room. In the good old days, before 
television, a political boss from someplace like Buffalo or St. Louis 
could sit down in peace and sell his delegates by the pound to the 
highest bidder. 

But not now. The last local boss who could get away with that was 
Mayor Daley from Chicago, who was croaked by McGovern 
insurgents in 1972 and died soon afterward. 

Since then, it has been more and more high tech . You can't even 
smoke in the back rooms any more. The conventions have become 
giddy rubber stamps and whoopee sessions that mean nothing at all, 
except to the pros and the players who are not always the same 
people, or at least not at first . The political business in America can 
make a pro of just about any good amateur, and a whore out of any 
pro. It is just a question of timing and balance. Nothing else. 

B Ut so what? These things are too widely understood unlike the heinous realities of a genuinely brokered convention, which will ruin the lives of all those involved in it, except the TV 
people. Just because it hasn't happened since Marilyn Monroe first 
posed naked doesn't mean it can't happen again. 

Which is terrifying, but absolutely true. It almost happened last 
time, in fact , when Gary Hart won California and didn't realize it 
until three days later. 

The loss of New Jersey in the morning sent him into such a funk 
that he locked himself into Warren Beatty's penthouse at the Beverly 
Wilshire Hotel and refused to talk to anybody including his ranking 
staff people, who were trying to tell him that he had swept California 
by midnight by enough votes to offset New Jersey and prevent 
Walter Mondale's nomination on the first ballot. I was on the phone 
with Pat Caddell and Frank Mankiewicz most of the night, but they 
couldn't reach him. Warren's security was too tight. It was some time 
around noon the next day when Gary finally learned that all he had 
to do to force the convention into a second ballot - where he would 
have been a smart-money favorite to beat Mondale - was make a 
few personal phone calls in the early morning, or just about the time 
George Wallace was having breakfast down in Alabama. 

Wallace had about 40 delegate to sell, and he liked Gary better 
than he liked Mondale - but Gary didn't call, and George did , and 
the rest is grim history. 

. .. And now, ye gods, the TV news has erupted with news bulletins 
about our new war in Iran. Marlin Fitzwater has called a press 
conference at the White House at 3 0 'clock in the morning, which has 
never happened before ... or at least not in more years than anybody 
in the Washington press corps can remember. . . It is a grim scene and 
the newsroom has gone wild . Who needs political commentary at a 
time like this? There's a war on. buddy. 

Letters 
Endorsements 
unfair 
Editor 

In the Monday, April II issue 
of the Guardian, the paper en-
dorsed certain candidates and 
positions on referenda in the 
1988 A.S. election. I do not 
believe this was appropriate. Too 
many students do not know the 
issues, and this encoura,es stu-
dents to vote based on a trivial 
point. Some students will assume 
that if the Guardian favors a 
candidate it must be a lood 
choice. It is not the paper's job to 
influence opinions this way. 

In addition, I question the 
basis for endorsement. For presi-
dent it reads, "He's in favor of a 
kick in the ass for Atkinson and 
others Just to let them know 
we're here." Althoulh Atkinson's 
policies may be questioned, there 
should be some respect for those 
in charle. 

In the referenda, I do not 
believe all of the facts are pre-
sented. Relarding football, only 
the negative aspects are brought 
uP. giving no regard for the 
positive aspects. True. the football 
proposal would cause an increase 
in fees. but it also has advantages 
for students. The issues are not 
that black and white. 

THE REAGAN ADMINISTrlATION ANP GEOrlGE 
SCHULTZ CUT THEMSELVES A DEAL 

The coverage of the elections 
was not all bad. Interviews with 
candidates running for key posi-
tions and a statement by each 
candidate was beneficial. This is 
helpful for those who are not 
informed, but this is where the 
coverage should stop. It is not 
the place of the Guardian to 
make endorsements.

Wilson's workload has increased 
to the point that she oftentimes 
sees as many as forty clients per 
week. This does not give her 
enou,h time to keep up with 
changes in the law she needs to 
be aware of in order to give 
accurate council to students Uling

Student Lepl Services is in

address this issue. 

Student Lepl Services is one 
ofthe few places a student can go 
on campus for usistance when

the University. Maybe those 
students who are so concerned

Conference 
By LISA CA VBLE 

"S o,how'stheWomen's 
Leadership Confer-
ence cominl alonl? 

Have you ,otten a keynote 
speaker yet? What topics are 
loing to be covered this year?" 

In answer to these questions. 
the Women's Resource Center 
must sadly say. "There will not 
be a Women's Leadership Con-
ference this year." Now, an 
explanation is in order. First, 
let's start witb the matter of 
funding. On Jan ... of last quar-
ter, over ISO fund-raising letters 
went to various on-campUl, U 
well U off-campus departments 
and orpnizations. These letters 
uked for any funding support as 
well u sponsorship that a Jl'oup 
could donate. In the letters 
addressed to those who lave 
financial support for lut year's 
conference, we asked for double 
the money for this year's confer-
ence as we wanted to make this 
year the first system-wide con-
ference inviting Itudents from 
other UC campuses. The result 
of the fund-raisina letters was 
minimal. 
Then came the budget alloca-
tions for the spring quarter. Here 
too, the allocations received were

far below what wu uked for as 
well u what wu needed to put 
on such an event as a two-eJay 
conference. ThUI, by Apri14, the 
total amount of funding for this 
year's conference wu S3.SOO, 
about one fourth oftbe S12,000 
pr .,posed budget. Yes, there were 
probably even more funding 
sources the Center should or 
could have tapped, but that 
brings us to the second issue. 

Woman Power. There just 
hasn't been enough blood, sweat, 
and tears volunteered by the 
women students on this campus 
in order to put on such an event. 
Oh, tbe interest to participate in 
the conference is tbere, but the 
individual effort needed to 
orpnize such a conference is a 
commitment that starts during 
fall quarter. Since we are all stu-
dents in the Women's Resource 
Center, our time is limited, and it

takes a dedication and desire 
that few people can inspire with-
out some self-sacrifice. Last 
year's conference wu a success, 
but all of UI involved paid her 
dues when it came to her Ir8des 
during spring quarter. 

So, what is bein, done by the 
powers that be to ri,ht this situa-
tion of student sacrifices? 

Well, we still don't have an 
administratively-run Women's 
Center, nor a ,enuine academi-
cally-run Women's Studies 
Department. When will UCSD 
catch up with the services pro-
vided by other UC campuses? 

All that can be said about this 
year's Women's Leadership Con-
ference can be summed up in two 
statements: It's too bad it couldn't 
get offthe ground, and let's hope 
tbat next year at this time some 
important steps forward have 
been accomplished.

Smoking ban is possible 
Continued from pale I 
to comply with the July deadline. 

The policy states: "No smoking 
will be permitted in any indoor 
area, including but not limited 
to: administrative offices, thea-
ters, libraries, private offices, 
lobbies, clinics, laboratories, 
lounge., waiting rooms, class-
rooms, hallways, reception areas, 
conference rooms, stairwells, 
university vehicles, auditoriums, 
restrooms, and food service areas 
(including adjacent outdoor 
eating areas)." In addition,smok-
ers who wish to quit will be 
provided with educational and 
other assistance under the policy. 

Accordin, to Bloon, the com-
mittee considered other smokin, 
policies, such as those of UCSD 
Medical Center and UCSF. The 
ban on the sale of cigarettes and 
smoking material was suggested 
by faculty memben who observed 
such a ban at the V.A. Hospital. 

One of the smoking policies 
that the committee looked at was 
a 3S-page document. "We wanted 
to make this initial draft as simple 
as possible," Bloor said.

heartfelt thanks; to those who 
didn't care, I send a harsh 
admonishment. While I did not 
win the election, I feel that I, 
nonetheless, made a difference. I 
also learned that sometimes the 
strongest message falls on deaf 
ears. I honestly felt that I could 
have done a terrific job, but 
apparently UCSD didn't agree. 
Of course, there is always next 
year. 

But don't despair, I hope to 
become involved in the A.S. in 
some regard, so you can rest 
assured that my ideas will not go 
down to defeat. Finally, but cer-
tainly not last, Leora Elazar, you 
were a great help. Thanks to all

not sell cigarettes if the policy is 
enacted. In response to the possi-
bility that the sale of cilarettes 
will be banned on campus, the 
store is not reordering slow selling 
brands of cigarettes so that no 
excess inventory is left over ifthe 
poliey begins. 

The store is still reordering the 
popular fast-selling brands of 
cigarettes, such as Marlboro. 

Reaction to the proposal 
varied: ") think banning cigarette 
smoking in the outdoor areas is a 
little draconian," Lin,uiltics 
Department Administrative 

ASSIstant Karen Andrews said. 
She added, "I'm surprised they 
think they can ban the sale of 
cigarettes on campus." Andrews, 
who is a non-smoker, described 
henelf as "deathly allergic" to 
cigarette smoke. 

According to another non-
smoleer, Jean Wilbern, a Physics 
secretary, banning smoking in 
any indoor areas is a good idea: 
"Most people in the offices 
upstairs 10 outside to smoke 
anyway." Wilbern also said that 
stopping the aale of cigarettes on 
campus was good. lID

Outward Bound blazes 
trail coast to coast 
By JULIE MUNRO 
Stlf/! wrlt~ 

F or twenty-eight days , Elaine Palmer started every morning witha two-
and-a-half mile run over granite, 
through woods, and across 
ravines. Shethen completed each 
morning's jaunt with a bone-
chilling dip in the northern 
Atlantic Ocean. She spent four 
of the days alone on an island 
living off of spruce gum, wild 
mustard, and mussels. 

Learning to use fire-fighting 
equipment and swinging on a 
rope "like Tarzan," Palmer 

noted, were also on her agenda. 
Returning from her adventure 
scratched and bruised, she said 
she "had the best time of her 
life ... 

Palmer may sound like Indiana 
Jones' new counterpart, but she 
is actually one of over 110,000 
Americans who have particip-
ated in courses offered by 
Outward Bound, described by its 
president, John F. Reynolds, as 
an "adventure-based education 
organization ... 

The over five hundred courses 
offered year-round concentrate 
on a variety of activities in-

cycling, whitewater raftina, and 
dogsledding . Donna L. 
Thompson, director of public 
relations for Outward Bound, 
explained that the term "outward 
bound" was used by seamen to 
mean venturing out and leaving 
the safety and security of their 
harbor. This is part of the spirit 
of the organization's courses, 
which are conducted in remote 
wilderness areas from five 
' chools nationwide. 

There is a mental objective to 
these physically challenging 
courses. Thompson explained 
that participants of different 
backgrounds, who most oft.:n 
come together as strangers,learn 
to work together to get from 
point "A" to point "B". Everyone 
is given an opportunity to lead. 
In addition to having fun, 
students feel a great exhilaration 
after accomplishing Outward 
Bound's demanding activities. 
According to Thompson, this 
experience carries over into their 
daily lives because when they are 
faced with challenges later, they 
are able to gather courage by 
thinking back on these achieve-
ments. 

Students are not expected to 
be experienced outdoorsmen, 
although .being in fairly good 
physical shape is recommended. 
The Outward Bound instructors 
are all Red Cross-trained for 
fmt aid and know CPR. Most in-
structors are college graduates, 
and many are world-class mount-
aineers, sailors and paddlers. 

First aid skills are taught to 
the students during the courses 
in addition to physical skills. 
Students are also taught to care 
for the environment with "no-
trace" camping techniques, such 
as packing everything out 
(including toilet paper) and not 
building fires .

The hardwood floor squeaks as

any, who will be pedorming at

8 pm. 

The company will restage 
Broadway dancer and choreo-
grapher Tanis Michael's works, 
"Tour de France" and "Dance 

for Three" in a quiet tribute to 
his memory. Also to be per-
formed is Bob Fosse's "Crunchy 
Granola Suite" from the hit 
Broadway show "Dancin," and 
several original repertory favo-
rites by Pat Rincon, "Samba" 
and "Highrise," and Melissa 
Nunn's "Daybreak." 

The Jazz Unlimited Company 
was established in 1979 to pro-
duce concen jazz dance. Their 
thematic dance style is derived 
from contemporary forml of 
ballet, modem and jazz dance. 
Rincon, its founder, portrays jazz 
dance as a serious pedorming 
art. She achieves quality stage 
work by presenting high-energy 
charisma, combined with excel-
lent technical and choreographic 
presentation. 

Rincon, to ensure the above 
criteria, is involved in every 
aspect of production from choreo-
graphy, to music, to artistic 
design to business matlen. All of 
these facets of the company keep 
her too busy to actually pedorm.

responsible for choosing some 
12,000 book titles a year for the 
Bookstore's general books 
section, which ranges from philo-

Nature 
Continued from pale. 

Jordan Orwig, a San Diego 
high school senior, spent eight 
days rlver rafting on the Day 
Chutes river in central Oregon 
last summer as part of an 
Outward Bound course. He said 
everyone learns to work together 
both by listening to the captain 
of the raft, and by rotating the 
responsibilities in camp luch as 
cooking, cleaning up,. and 
pumping the rafts. He saId he 
learned to think about others 
and to trust them. 

At the end of each coune, the 
instructon Jive each student a 
penonal interview to evaluate 
them and give students an 
opportunity to evaluate the 
instructor, 

There are minimum age limits 
for each trip with Outward 
Bound but there are no upper 
age limits. People of similar ages 
tend to be grouped together; 
however. Orwi, met a couple in 
their sixties takin, the rafting 
coune in Ore,on, and Palmer 
was with a seventy-five-year-old 
man on Hurricane Island. 

There are specialized courses 
for groups with common interests 
and needs, some of which are 
available for whole groups with 
a contract arran,ement. The 
Professional Development 
Program, for example, is de-
signed to build teamwork, 
leadership, risk-takin" and 
penonal renewal skills wbich are 
assets to professionals, The 
instructors for these courses are 
trained to draw analogies 
between activities and the work-
place during debriefing ICSsions 
and lectures, 

The Outward Bound Program 
for Troubled Youth is another 
set of specialized courses. Their 
aim is to offer students, ages 14 
through 17, a chance to build 
confidence and self-esteem to 
help them deal with motivational 
or behavioral problems, such as 
with school, drugs. the law, or 
family. 

The courses range in tuition. 
The price of transportatio~ is 
not included. Some typIcal 
examples are: $800 for eight days 
of whitewater canoeing, $1870 
for 26 days of sailing and sea 
kayaking, or $3800 for a 90 day 
semester of skiing and do,-
sledding followed by whitewater 
paddlin, and desert bikini. 

Outward Bound is a nonprofit, 
tax-exempt educational orpn-
ization, and the greater part of 
the feel for Outward Bound are 
used to pay the hiJhly-skilled 
instructon. The rest of the money 
is used for the equipment, faci-
litiel, paperwork, and other 
expenses. 1m

V-ball to host first 
SCVBC tourney 
By BRIAN ITOW 
S~""'n 

This weekend, at the Triton 
Gym, the Triton men '5 volleyball 
team plays in the flSt Southern 
California Volleyball Conference 
Tournament. The tourney will 
match UC Irvine (4-2). The 
Univenity of La Verne (2-4), 
Chapman Collele (3-3). and host 
UCSD(3-3). Conference records 
in parenthesis. 

"Expect to see a fierce battle 
between all four teams," said 
UCSD coach Diller Graybill. 
an instrumental figure in the 
formation of the new lealue, 
who is also servinl as its 
commissioner, "Everyone has a 
chance to win it ." 

NCAA volleyball teams in 
Southern California who weren't 
playina in a leaaue. Our area has 
the Western Intercollegiate Vol-
leyball Association - the top 
conference in the nation - and 
nothinl else," Graybill said. 

"Teams like Chapman and La 
Verne thoulht it was a lood idea 
to join. So last year, when UC 
Irvine started their volleyball 
program, the wheels were already 
turninl and their entraace gave· 
us a fourth team in the area and 
their entrance gave us a fourth 
team in the area and the founda-
tion fora very strong conference. " 

With every team capable of 
being crowned the first cham-
pion of the Southern California 
Volleyball Conference. here is a 
brief assessment of the four 
competing teams. 

Digger Graybill was a major 
force in the creation of the 
conference. 

University of La Veme - La 
Verne is UCSD's opponent in 
the opening round of the 
tournament. They are capable of 
winning it all as they have shown 
with wins over UCSD and UCI 
earlier in the year. Coached by 
Jim Paschal, La Verne has lots 
of strOM hitten who have proven 
to be ULVand UCSD have gone 
five games and their match 
Friday night should be another 
bam burner. 

UC San Ditto - Early in the 
season, Graybill felt UCSD had 
the potential to be the best 
volleyball team ever at the 
school. Instead, it has been the 
most injured . But the team has 
overcome the adversity of losinl

UCSD Surf 
Team Success 
By MIKE FOLEY 
s,.gw"'~ 

The UCSD surf team con-
tinued its successful season at 
last weekend's NSSA-Collegiate 
Divilion competition held in 
Newport Beach. The team placed 
third overall in the two day event 
held at the Newport River Jetty 
April 9 and 10. Other schools 
competinl were SDSU, USD, 
USC. UCLA. Pepperdine, UCSB. 
and overall winner Golden West. 

Conditions for the competi-
tion were not ideal. Competitors 
were forced to contend with 
small, shorebreak waves and 
thick fog which hampered vis-
ibility for both surfers and judges. 
However, team member Isabelle 
Tihanyi said there was "awesome 
surfing despite the harsh con-
ditions ... 

The team's third place finish 
overall is very impressive con-
sidering it was missing top body-
boarder Bob Crawford and 
coach / team member Milee 
Gleavy who is recovering from 

surgery. 
Particularly impressive was 

UCSD 'A' team member Brad 
Africano who won the men" divi-
sion - becomina the fint Triton 
to win a major competition in a 
few years. Team captain Allen 
Johnson placed 7th and Steve 
Colt was 11th. both reachina the 
semi-final heats. Surf Club Pres-
ident Jack Beresford won the 
knee-board competition, con-
tinuing his dominance in that 
division. Tihanyi also surfed very 
well, finishing 4th in the women '5 
division. 

Riaht now the team is getting 
primed for the upcomina state 
championships on May 7-8 in 
Hunington Beach. The team's • 
overall strength in all divisions 
and !.he fact that the state chalJl1: 
pionships will be the first time 
UCSD wi1l have its entire 'A' 
team competing malee team mem-
bers very optimistic goina into 
the championships. This year's 
team has a very solid chance of 
winning next month's competi-
tion and going on to the nation-
als. mJ 

Every team in the league is 
capable of beatinl the others. 
which has been evident durinl 
regular season play. UC Irvine. 
the regular season champion, 
lost to both UCSD and last place 
La Verne which fin ished its 
season only one game under .500. 
And ten of the fifteen league 
matches went the maximum five 
games before being decided. So, 
if history repeats itself the tour-
nament should feature some 
very balanced volleyball. 

UC Irvine - The Anteaters 
have to be considered the 
favorites after compiling a 4-2 
league record. They come into 
the tourney full of confidence 
and experience, after playing 
some of the top teams in WIV A. 
Coached by Bill Ashen, the team 
has a strong front line capable of 
deminating any match. 

Chapman Collele - Chap-
man is another excellent team. 
Coach J ohn Barnes has done an 
excellent jClb of combining a tall 
front line with some smart 
hitters and dillers and blending 
them into a very formidable 
opponent. 

~jor League COrT)mentary 
The league was the product of 

some hard work by Graybill in 
organizing the confere nce. 
"Looleing around the last couple 
of years, I saw some very good 

Reds will take N. L. West

By MIKE MARTINEZ 
St~ Wrltn 

It seems that every baseball 
season the divisional races take 
on characteristic tendencies. 
Over the years the favorites and 
tailenders change, and the ten-
dencies rotate around the lea-
gues. There's a weak sister divi-
sion (now the AL West), a multi-
contender division (AL East), 
and the two-or three-borserace 
(NL East). The NL West of recent 
years has had underachiever 
favorites and runaway races. The 
division as a whole features a 
nutty collection of hotheads 
(Mario Tot, Joaquin Andujar), 
sourpusses (Jeffrey Leonard), hot-
shots (Will Clark, Pedro Guer-
rero) and strange-gloves (Candy 
Maldonado, Keith Moreland). 
It even has Kirk Gibson, who is 
all of the above. 

The Cincinnatti Reds have 
been that underachiever favorite 
for years now. Lack of pitching 
has been their tragic flaw, but 
this winter they sent Kurt Still-
well to the Royals for Danny 
Jacleson, one of KC's toughest 
starters the year they won it all . 
He's far from washed-up, and 
suprisingly neither is Mario Soto. 
who felt spry enough to start 
Opening Day. Former 20-gamer 
Tom Browning and Ex-Yanleee 
Dennis Rasmussen round out a 
potentially good staff. Jose Rijo 
can start or complement John 
Franco and Rob Murphy in a 
decent bullpen. 

A two day hitting slump and a 
fluky line drive botched by 
Candy Maldonado kept the San 
Francilco Giants from getting to 
the '87 Series and a chance to 
play some DomeBall with the 

Twins. They've improved their 
offense by unloading Butler. 
Roger Craig, baseball's latest 
genius. has the enviable problem 
of finding playing time for his 
best clutch hitter, Mike Aldrete. 
Even Aldrete can't crack a Mur-
derer's Row of Butler. Kevin 
Mitchell, Will (Call me "Thrillj 
Clark, Maldonado, and leo-
nard. Even Jose Uribe lets clutch 
hits . Dave Dravecky, who the ' 
Padres found wanting, is now 
the Giants' ace and he's tougher 
than anybody San Diego got in 
that crummy deal. They also 
have Mike Krukow, Kelly 
Downs. and Rick Reuschel, 
who's been making thinner men 
like silly for many years. Mike 
laCoss and Atlee Hammaker 
add insurance, and the bullpen is 
solid with righties Robinsion and ~ 
Garrelts and lefties Lefferts and

N.L. East 
Continued from pale 12 
Price. Why can't this powerhouse 
win the division? Good question. 
These Giants are already getting 
cocley, and the '80'5 haven't been 
Ieind to repeaters. 

The HOUlton AlkOl are strong-
er than when they won in '86. 
They've finally unloaded stiff-
limbed Jose Cruz and now sport 
a Cardinal-style outfield with two 
roadrunners (Billy Hatcher and 
Gerald Young) and a versatile 
RBI man (Kevin Vass). Second 
baseman Billy Doran adds more 
speed, and Glenn Davis is young 
and strong in the cleanup slot. 
They also appear to have good 
pitching in Mike Scott. Bob 
Knepper and Jim Deshaies, who 
has recovered nicely from rotator 
cuff surlery. Dave Smith is a 
reliable closer. Take a hard look, 
however, and the Astros have a 
few too many question marks. 
Will Nolan Ryan finally fade? Is 
Andujar mentally and physically 
ready for a tough penant race? 
Their shortstop is Rafael Ram-
eriz, who couldn't even make the 
Braves roster, and they have no 
third baseman to speak of. Hal 
Lanier is a wily enough game 
manaller to make it a race, but 
he's a few hosses short. 

If mere change were insurance 
of good times, the Lot Anlela 
Dodlen could start bidding on 
printers for those Series tickets. 
They've added so many house-
hold names it's like an new house. 
GM Fred Claire gave up Bob 
Welch and signed some expen-
sive new free alents, but that 
gusty gamble has improved the 

franchise for the short haul. In 
that powerful new Dodger line-
up, which can play hardball any 
day with the Giants, the 3 to 7 
spots (Gibson, Guerrero, Milee 
Marshall, Milee Davis, and John 
Shelby) all have 20-home-run 
capability. Steve Sax and Milee 
Scoscla also come to play. The 
bullpen is stronler if new guys 
Ii lee Jesse Orosco and Jay Howell 
can still pitch lilee All-Stars . For 
the first time in memory, Fer-
nando Valenzuela is being doubt-
ed after a mediocre '87 season 

The Cincinnatti Reds 
have been the under-

.achiever favorite. 
Padre fans can thank 
heaven for the Braves. 
who have already 
been mathematically 
eliminated. 

and Orel Hershiser has pitched 
only .500 ball for two years. 
Their status makes the loss of 
Welch hurt even more, but the 
gamble is that DodIer sluggers 
can put most games out of reach. 
The defense is questionable every-
where except at short (Alfredo

Can the San DielO Padr"

Well, they started 0-5 again, and

petitive fire when reliever Goose 
Gossage departed for friendly 
confines . Heir apparent Lance 
McCullers shows flashes of bril-
liance. but he runs hot and cold . 
Their "aces" (quotes intended) 
Eric Show and Ed Whitson are 
.500 pitChers at best. The middle 
of the batting order (Tony 
Gwynn, Randy Ready, John 
Kruk, Keith Moreland, Benny 
Santiago) is quite capable. Only 
Santiago's talents at the plate 
and in the crouch are truly 
stirring. Kruk deserves to be a 
cult hero. but unfortunately 
Tony Gwynn's subtle talents are 
essentially superfluous on a lousy 
team. Chris Brown is already 
writing a ticleet out of this town 
unless he snaps out of his funk . 
After last year's record , Chub 
Feeney should have gotten help. 
He didn't. 

Padre fans can thanle heaven 
for the Atlant. BraY", who have 
already been mathematically eli-
minated . Even the wondrous 
Dale Murphy may be tempted to 
start hitting the malteds as the 
Braves sinle further out of sight. 
They have so little that Zane 
Smith represents the staff ace, 
and Gerald Perry constitutes a 
Ieey player. Ozzie Virgil will hit 
20 home runs and bat .100. This 
team got rid of Doyle Alexander, 
David Palmer and Glenn Hub-
bard, who were at least players. 
They added Buddy Bi.ancalana, 
who is not. In response to their 
0-10 start, Polyanna manager 
Chucle Tanner made vague re-
assurances about things event-
ually coming together. Yes they 
will, Chucle. Oh, and thank you 
for the vote of confidence. Ted

THAT NIGHT 

'"1'0 enter the world of this inCantatory novel is to palpably recall.

disillusionments of first love."

COMMONS 

Tourney 
Continued from pace 11 
all its setters and its right side 
player. After losing its first three 
league matches, the Tritons 
rebounded to win their last three, 
mainly because of the play of 
setter Milee Badt. Badt, who did 
not malee the Triton roster was 
brought back after the rash of 
injuries to their setters and he 
has proven that he belopgs. 

"When we cut Mike I felt he 
wa.n't as good as our other four 
letters. It looks as if I mi,ht have 
to eat my words, .. said GraybiU. 

White Badt has provided 
ltability at the setter position, 
the rest of the team has done 
everythin, they bad to. Senior 
Paul Miller has been a dominant 
force at the net and outside hitters 
Jeff Babcock and Nick Roghrnan 
have done outstanding jobs 
offensively and defensively to 
lead the Tritons. 

"The tournament comes down 
to whoever is playing the best at 
the time," said Bill Ashen earlier. 
"Anyone has a chance to win."

SOFTBA'L PREVIEW 
Well folks, it's that time of year again, 

softball season. Break out that old mitt 
And I mean old. You've had it since little 
league and there's no way you'd ever get 
nd of the old rag. Yep we all have our 
qUirks, and we all love softball 
MEN'SAAA 

This looks like a division of haves and 
have nots. The haves: fritz I, Fat - tough 
pitching with a dynamic duo of Frank Fitz-
gerald and Mike Hipp. Team is approp-
riately named after these two Of course 
Mickey Lolich wasn't a beanpole either 
and hE" won the Cy Young Award . They 
also have raided the baseball team for 
stars Jim Nicholson and Brian Rude. ThiS 
two should carry the team to the title. 
ChoIGe - Aptly named for the biggest 'choke' 
In 1M history in last year's AAA Cham-
pionship. Ahead 7 -3 in the last inning they 
lost 8-7. Still the old guys, and Roche, can 
Slill play. Slide It In - pulled big upset by 
beating spnng training favorites Slider 
Insider, Old Jay Calder has picked up 
some questionable talent as in Ken Stet-
ter, but they look tough Profesaof Long-
hal, - last year's AA champs have proved 
theyare for real by going 2-0 in their first 
two games 

MEN'S AA 
It's early to tell who the nngers are but 

we have an idea. Slow. Ugly as usual IS 
up there. Perennial toughjes LUI_OHhe 
Field always makes the playoffs and 
loses In the first round. lraln Damage IS 
brain damaged. The FrMbaIl." woul~ 
be in AAA if they didn't gag last year In the 
playoffs. The W', have been doing some 
popping off but that was short lived as 
they have already lost. 

COEDAAA 
This diviSion is wide open this year. As 

usual the ladies will be carrying the guys. 
Take Mary Beth Murray, she's the best 
third sacker in all 1M's. Chris McCallum is 
being considered to take the hard hitting 
Stanley Jefferson's position of centerfield 
for the Padres. She can run faster and 
obviously hit better. Pam Saldana of onv. 
The Gap is the best low ball hitter this side 
of Will Clark. Jill Gilbert of Through The 
Hole can handle the first sack as well as 
the "Garv." When all is said and done,it 
could be a battle of the ladies for the 
championship. 
WOMEN'S 

The talent here looks like a four-team 
race. But these four teams can really play. 
Last year's champs, Softhand, For Soft 
lall', look like they could repeat. The 
talent is there. But, the other teams have 
improved and it will be tight. The Round-
ball." , basketball players for those who 
don't understand the lingo, are very athletic 
and have the "grand 01' lady" in coach 
Malone. The always tough lIohazarda 
have given most of their time to Floor 
Hockey, but they can still play some ball. 
IIte"- With lab could be a sleeper.

UCSD's Newest Late 
Night Hot Spot! 

Campus security has been puzzled all 
week by the screaming and yelling com-
Ing from the indoor pool very late at night. 
There's only one thing that will keep the 
UCSD student up 'till 1 :00 a.m., a midterm 
the next day. What could It be that has 
library hounds out of central and into the 
natatonum so late at night? 

......... -

The answer is Innertube waterpolo. For 
the uninitiated, "Tube-Polo" IS a zany 
concoction cooked up by the 1M gods that 
IS a combination of nver rafting, water polo 
and taking a bath with your favorite rubber 
duck Seven players (SIX field and one 
goalie) hop In Innertubes and paddle their 

way around the natatorium For the begin-
ners just staying afloat is a major accomp-
lishment. Experienced players move around 
the the pool like someone strapped an 
outboard motor to a lazy-boy recliner. 
They warm up before Q.ames by pulling 
waterskiers around the pool. 

Teams in our most competitive league 
(AftA Wednesday nights) move the ball 
up the pool like the Lakers, and everyone 
has a cannon strapped to their Side. The 
Intermediate, AA, teams are almost as 
good, but may have a couple of weak links 
that keep them from playing in the big 
leagues. At the recreational, A, level, the 
lifeguards can become a little nervous. 
Games often resemble Three Stooges 
films. Players don't really get around in 
their tubes, they sort of manage to stay 
afloat In them or on them. You are more 
likely to see a pop gun than any cannons 
at this level. With or without Olympic 
caliber talent everyone has a great time. 
Why else would people be rushing out of 
the computer lab at midnight with a towel 
In one hand and a rubber duck In the 
other?

Sunllte Volleyball CllUslc 
The most notable misnomer in the 

UCSD Special Events program has done 
it again! Yes folks, that sunny and glorious 
beast known as the Sunlite Beach Volley -
ball Classic once again lived up to its sto-
ried past. Kind of! 

In a day reminiscent of hot and cold 
running water, the Sunlite Classic dodged 
its usual assortment of unpredictable wea-
ther and came to conClusion late Sunday 
afternoon with the dynamite team of Dave 
Pregerson-Madeline Schneider annexing 
the title with a 15-11 win over Chris Lotito 
and Diana Kl intworth. 

Pregerson-Schneider, Lotito-Klintworth 
were the featured survivors of a 32-
person mixed rotational draw tournament 
that saw each player paired up with eight 
different partners. The 11-hour ordeal 
saw the field sandblast their way through 
the 64-game tournament and finish just 
as the last rays of scattered sun left the 
beach at 7:45 p.m. 

Pregerson and Klintworth were the indi-
vidual standouts in pre-lim playas they 
won their divisions with 7-1 and 8-0 
records respectively. Scott Criswell, Brian 
Parent and Lotito were finalist 
the Men's Division while Linda Ross 
Carol Lipson teamed With Klintworth a 
Maddie the Magnificent in the Wo 

Seventh A nnulll Nationlll 
Floor Hockey Tournament 

When you think of dynasties, Lakers, 
Yankees, and CeHics would probably come 
to mind. Well you can add UCSD's floor 
hockey team to that list. As the 7th Annual 
National Collegiate Floor Hockey Invita-
tional commences tomorrow and Satur-
day, UCSD will put their 15 game unbeaten 
string on the line, and go for its 4th straight 
national crown. The streak alone is impres-
sive If you look at the opponents they have 
faced. This year's teams include UC Davis, 
USD, SDSU, USC,CPSLO,CSUSB, and 
Louisiana State University. Newcomers 
will be UC Riverside and UC Irvine. 

The unbeaten streak started with C. 
taln Dick and Hit Seamen winning it all 
in 1985, and it continued with IIltz11relg 
winning in 1986 and 1987. This year, 
those two teams combined to get 11111· 
dick (pretty original, guys!). They breezed 
to the AAA title and will represent UCSD. 
The Dicks will also count on the help of 
other UCSD all-stars like Dick Thopp, 
Mike Levitan, and Pat Henson. They are 
led, of course, by the ancient Orient 
express. The grandfathers of floor hockey, 
Chang-Iko-Kent combo, will bid farewell 
to the hockey world. Kent will be playing in 
his unprecedented fifth and final tourna-
ment. Iko will graduate with Kent, finally. 
But rumor has it Chang is coming back for 
his 8th yearl! Can you believe that? I 
guess graduation is not in his vocabulary. 

The games start Friday and the Pool 
Play continues until midnight. The single 
elimination round starts Saturday at 8 a.m. 
with the championship game starting at 
3:00 p.m. Come out to the Rec Gym and 
check out the action. Watch as UCSD 
tries to make history.

The latest installation in the 
Stuart Collection, "La Jolla 
Vista View" by William 
Wegman, was inaugurated by 
a series of lunches, conferen~ 
ces, and a site inspection with 
the artist last April 15~ 17. 

The Stuart Collection is a 
sculpture garden on campus 
featuring modern artists, 
funded by James Stuart 
DeSilva, a La Jolla business-
man. 

"La Jolla Vista View" is 
placed approximately 100 feet 
north and east of the Mandell 

• 

Weiss Theater and consists of 
a drinking fountain, wooden 
benches, plants, and stone 
walls fashioned after the style 
of scenic overlooks and road-
side historical markers. A 
sturdy telescope powerful 
enough to read the La Jolla 
Village Theater marquee also 
is at the site. 

From the site there is a 
magnificent view to the east 
and southeast, including the 
La Jolla Marriott, Mount San 
Miguel, and the Hillcrest sky~ 
line. 

A vast bronze plate is en~ 
graved with a drawing by 
Wegman of that view. When

asked ifhe feared that the view 
might change as development 
changes the appearance of the 
area, Wegman said, "That's 
the reason for its date," refer~ 
ring to the "1987" engraved 
on a nearby nameplate. 

"The drawing is already 
obsolete," Wegman amplified, 
mentioning that some build~ 
ings which were incomplete 
frames when he drew the illus-
tration are now completed. 
Wegman, who made 20 trips 
to UCSD to complete the 
drawing, also said that some 
bare patches of earth, such as 
the one labeled "mystery dirt" 
in his drawing, will probably 

be built over in the near tuture. 
According to Mary Beebe; 

director of the Stuart Collec-
tion, the total cost of "La Jolla 
Vista View" was approxi-
mately $70,000, .of which 
$20,000 was paid for by the 
National Endowment for the 
Arts and the remainder paid 
for by the Stuart Foundation. 
Beebe confirmed that Weg~ 
man's piece is one of the least 
expensive of the Stuart Col-
lection's installations. 

Wegman's piece is perhaps 
the most site~specific in the 
Stuart Collection. It's whole 
point is a detailed reference to 
its surroundings. With the 

exception of some larg~ palm 
trees that were already present 
on the site, only native plants 
have been planted. 

Since telescope use is free, 
and the water fountain works, 
"La Jolla Vista View" is one 
of the finest on~campus picnic 
sites, the equal of any scenic 
overview on any road in the 
nation. 

The point of its vista view 
would be difficult as parody if 
the site did not in fact have a 
"vista view." In terms of its 
theme, Wegman's work is the 
most accessible and under~ 
standable Stuart Collection 
piece .

Living 
that 

night 
by robert leone 

hianu writer 

That Night is a novel about 
a boyfriend trying to see 
his girlfriend; about attitudes; 
about suburbs in the early 
'60s; and about love's failures. 

It is also a well-crafted 
nominee for the Pulitzer. 

Written by UCSD instruc-
tor Alice McDermott, the 
book is set around "that 
night" when Rick, a high 
school "hood," and his friends 
tried to force their way into 
the house where Sheryl, Rick's 
pregnant girlfriend, lives. The 
book is not sequential, since 
the novel always jumps back 
and forth to "that night." The 
incidents in the book are set in

after "that night." She is 
alternately a 10-year-old girl, 
a divorced woman, and an 
omniscient commentator. 

Despite the shifts in time, 
That Night is easy to follow. 
It is rich in observation, 
theme and language. When 
small children negotiate their 
parents' conflicting descrip-
tion of the "birds and the 
bees," we read "Georgie tried 
bed and sleeping a few times 
but then conceded them when 
I said car and darkness." 

That Night is a good novel. 
If you have the opportunity, 
read it.

Moderllistic dance 
by eleonor cutillo 

hiatue writer 

"I'm always eager to sup-
port dance companies. I be-
lieve they're one of the more 
neglected forms of art in San 
Diego," said La Jolla Museum 
of Contemporary Art Perfor-
mance curator Stuart Mclean, 
The Museum, in promoting 
San Diego Dance Month, is 
presenting three San Diego 
groups in a series of concerts 
which \1ill run for three con-
secutive weekends this month, 

As co-sponsor of the event, 
Mclean hopes to make this 
first-time series "actively 
repeated year after year," The 

companies featured are the 
Samahan Philippine Dance 
Company, Jazz Unlimited 
Dance Company, and 3 's 
Company with Helen Dan-
nenberg. "They all do quality 
work," remarked Mclean. 

"We live in a very conser-
vative community. They like 
what tends to be more like 
ballet-type dancing," said 3's 
Company's artistic director 
Jean Issac. "We have received 
recognition as an exemplary 
dance group. But to grow· 
means more money, and we 
don't get the city's dollar sup-
port like the Opera and Sym-
phony." 

The series began on April 

3's Company performing New-Age ceremonial sknnp. 

16 with the performance of 
the Samahan Philippine Dance 
Company. The two-hour pro-
gram titled "The Legend of 
Sarimanok" included a group 
of stylized dances based on the 
"ceremonies, rituals and 
courtship practices of the 
Maranao people during the 
rule of sultans in the southern 
Philippine Islands." Incorpo-
rated into the program were 
new dances choreographed by 
Ruby Peal Chiong and Lolita 
D. Carter (founder of the 
company). 

joined by the group for the 
La Jol1a performances was 
guest choreographer and 
dancer Tony Salant. Under 
the direction of Narissa Reyes, 
the Samahan Kulintang En-
semble accompanied the 
dancers on such traditional 
instruments as a bamboo xylo-
phone and primitive flutes and 
guitars. 

Performing this weekend 
will be the Jazz Unlimited 
Dance Company. The two 
showings will feature guest 
performances by Barry Bernal 
(of Broadway's hit musical 
"Starlight Express") and Los 
Angeles' Scott Benson. A new 
work by associate director 
Alicia Rincon will be pre-
miered and danced by Glean 
Lewis. In tribute to late cho-
reographer Tanis Michaels, his 
jazz dances "Tour de France" 
and "Dance for Three" will be 
performed. Other dances to 
be featured are "Crunchy 
Granola Suite," "Samba," 

INTERNATIONAL STYLE FILM SERIES 

Jatt Unlimited Dancers will be performing this weekend at L}MCA. 
"Easter" and "Daybreak." 

3's Company will complete 
the series with guest choreo-
grapher Helen Dannenberg. 
Dannenberg, a graduate of 
New York 's School of Per-
forming Arts, is a three-time 
recipient of a Choreographic 
Fellowship from the National 
Endowment of the Arts. The 
premier performance of a duet 
by associate choreographer 
Nancy McCaleb and former 
Twyla Tharp dancer John 
Malashock will be presented 
in the program. Also included 
will be "New Age Ceremonial 

Stomp," by artistic director 
Jean Issac. In this piece, "the 
sounds you hear are from the 
dancers' bodies," Issac said, 

3's Company differs from 
Jan Unlimited's "commercial 
appeal" because of its greater 
vocabulary of movement. 
"Modern dance is aesthetic, 
more experimental," Issac 
said. The group combines jazi 
and new music with pop and 
modern art into their dances. 
3'5 Company performs regu-
larly on campus at the Man-
dell Weiss Theatte.

Dance 
Continued from page 3 

There was no selection pro-
cess for the series. According 
to McLean, a number of dance 
companies approached him to 
perform at the Museum in 
April, and thus the series 
resulted. Four companies were 
originally scheduled, but the 
fourth group, under the direc-
tion ofJohn Malashock, had to 
drop out of the series. 

The two remaining pro-
grams, by J~zz Unlimited 
(April 22 and 23) and 3's 
Company with Helen Dan-
nenberg (April 29 and 30), 
will be presented in the Muse-
um's Sherwood Auditorium. 
Admission to the concert is 
$18 (series), $7 (concert) for 
LJMCA members, members 
of the San Diego Area Dance 
Alliance, students and seniors; 
$30 (series) and $11 (con-
cert) for non-members. Ad-
vance tickets can be purchased 
by calling 278-TIXS.

Annex Art Like Alli Spooner's work "Iud," a painting of a coiled snake separ-ated into three sections, "3" is the fragmentation of gallery space into three disconnected installations: "disparate paintings and the cactus" 
by Alli Spooner, "Fragments" by Marianne Binkin. and "The Game-
show" by Tammy Pollard.

Spooner, sitting just outside the gallery, talks of her show. "The titl~ 
'disparate paintings and the cactus' says it all. The last four weeks I have 
slept every other night, my ulcer came back - for a lousy five days in a 
crummy space ... is it worth it? Yes. I am comfortable with what I have 
got in here. I don't care what other people think of it, this is for me." 

Her works include five paintings - two of mixed medium, three of 
oil - and a nine-and-one-half foot cactus shaped out of wire and 
covered in green gauze. The cactus is lit in each of its arms, and at its 
crux is a white cross depicting images of death and rebirth. Spooner 
calls her creation "The cactus (from Hell!)." She continues to explain 
its title. "I have spent the last six months on it. It was the burden of my 
life. I would rather have a baby than the cactus." 

"Fragments" by Marianne Binkin is located in the south narrow hall 
of the gallery. It is separated by curtains of black plastic. All around the 
edges of the room are lit candles sitting with broken green glass from 
bottles of Little King Creame Ale. The sparse room includes only tables 
with the same tiny white candles sitting on ·mirrors. From the corner of 
the room runs a projector of many empty slides. Its eyepiece is covered 
with a blue screen, so against the side wall is a blue square of light 
constantly fliclcering on and off with each blank cartridge of the 
projector. 

"The Gameshow" installation was not complete because of technical 
problems. It is scheduled to open Wednesday. The show will continue 
through April 29, with the reception on April 22.
