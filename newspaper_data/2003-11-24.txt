Regents outline priorities 
amidst budget uncertainty 
By BRYAN lSAO 

Associate News Editor 

Faci n g up to $2 billion in 
potential budget cuts, the UC 
Board of Regents released 
"Principles for Determining 
Priorities for the 2004-05 Budget" 
during the UC Regents meeting 
on ov. 19 at UCLA. The princi-
ples indicated that both student fee 
increases and enrollment caps are 
the likely strategies for dealing 
with potential budget cuts. Nearly 
200 student protesters from several 
UC campuses, induding UCSD, 
protested at the meeting, opposing 
fee increases and enrollment caps 
while eeking greater accessibility 
to the Regents. 

The relea e identified three pri-
mary principles that the Regents 
will u e in setting the 2004-05 bud-
get: maintaining and enhanci ng the 
quality o f the university, maintain-

ing access and honoring the Master 
Plan to accept the top 12.5 percent 
of students from California' high 
school graduates and preserving 
affordability for students. Despite 
the potential budget cuts, the 
release stated that it would likely 
increase faculty salaries, hire more 
faculty and increase research sup-
port in accordance with the princi-
ple of maintaining quality. 

"The university wi ll not further 
risk the quality of the institution. 
To do so would sacrifice the prima-
ry asset that makes UC valuable to 
the state," the Regents stated in the 
release. "Preserving the quality of 
the university is in the best interest 
of all Californians." 

In order to fund the initiatives, 
the UC Board of Regents is con-
sidering instituting an enrollment 
cap, citing a lack of sufficient state 
funding. ccording to the M aster 
Plan, the University of California 

Women of Iraq'

Speakers oppose 'occupation' 

is obligated to accept the top 12.5 
percent of graduating California 
high school seniors, with the state 
providing "adequate resources to 
accommodate enrollment." 
However, since the California 
Department of Education states it 
will not consider funding for 
enrollment growth or salary-relat-
ed cost increases, the Board of 
Regents concluded that without 
state funding, the university would 
be forced to limit enrollment, 
while specifying that the cap would 
only be short-term. 

"The university has reached a 
point where taking more students 
without adequate resources will 
irreparably harm the university\; 
ability to offer a high-quality edu-
cation to those who anend," the 
Regents stated.

Study shows genetics factor 
in progess of HIV in children 

Researchers at UCSD School of Medicine 
have completed the largest-ever study of HN-
infected children, studying 1,049 patients 
under the age of 13. 

The results demonstrated that a child's indi-
vidual genetic factors are an important determi-
nant of disease progression and cognitive 
impairment associated with HN. 

The findings, published in the Nov. 15 issue 
of the Journal of Infectious Diseases, showed 
that slight genetic altemations can affect how 
the immune system responds to the virus and 
how the virus enters a cell, making some chil-
dren more susceptible than others to the wors-
ening of HN symptoms. 

The study identified individual polymor-
phisms that helped or worsened the chil-
drens' conditions. 

It also showed that personal genetic dif-
ferences do not affect children and adults in 
the same way, with some polymorphisms 
affecting one IndIVIdual but not the other. 

The UCSD team plans to continue research, 
hoping to Identify those Individuals who are at 
the highest risk for having difficulties with their 
H IV infection. 

The U.S. Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention estimates that 9,300 children 
under the age of 13 In the United States have 
AI.DS. 

There are about 3.2 million children under 
the age of 15 In the world that are HIV-posinve, 
according to the United Nations.

Regents: Board awaits governor's budget Textbooks: Reports show 
cheaper prices overseas continued [rom page I 

by 10 percent over the previous 
seven years, the Regents also 
indicated that they would insti-
tute a relatively small allnllal fee 
increase, possibly to be tied into 
increases in sta te per ca pi ta 
income. The Regents committed 
to continue to apply one-third of 
fcc increases toward financial aid, 
as well a covering the entire cost 
of any fee increase for low-
income students. Because of the 
recent gubernatorial change and 
the lack of a state budget, the 
Regents expect to submit a bud-
get for the University of 
California and determine any fee 
increases or enrollment caps after 
the state budget i released in 
January. 

"It totally depends on what 
the new governor's stance will 
be," Student Regent Matt 
Murray said. "The governor's 
office has not made any decisions 
about the University of 
California budgetwise, and the 
range of potential things that 
could happen to the university is 
quite large, just given that lack of 
knowledge about where the gov-
ernor stands." 

During the Regents meeting, 
approximately 200 student, 
including about 20 from UCSD, 
protested against the potential fee 
increa e and enrollment caps and 
called for more access to the 
Regents. UC President Robert C. 
Dyne and two other Regents left 
the meetings to briefly address the 
protesters. Despite protesters' 
calls for the Regents' specia l 
February meeting to be held at 
UCLA, Dynes refused to commit. 
All Regents meeting this year are 
scheduled to be held at UC San 
Franci co, the only campus with-
our undergraduates. 

"The UC Office of the 

President is up in Oakland," 
Murray said. "For Regents meet-
ings, many people who work in 
the office of the pre ident need to 
be there and it costs a large 
alllount of money to fly them 
somewhere and have them stay in 
hotels. It's quite expensive to do it 
somewhere other than the Bay 
Area." 

Nonetheless, Murray believes 
that the protestors were successful 
in getting their message across to 
the Regents. 

" Dynes heard very clearly 
that students are 

coru:emed about being 
consulted ... " 
- Matt Murray, 

2003-04 uc Student Regent 

"Dynes heard very clearly that 
students are concerned about 
being consulted in this process 
and about the details of the uni-
versity' principles of quality," 
Murray said. "I think that he, 
[Chairman of the Board of 
Regents John Moores] and the 
other Regents went out during 
the protcsts to listen to [the pro-
testers] ... I think that that was 
definitely a sign that the universi-
ty and the Regents care about 
what the students think." 

After Dynes addressed the 
crowd, protesters clashed with 
police when the protesting stu-
dents attempted to leave the 
public area of the meeting and 
approach the Regents. Police 
officers formed a line with their 
baton to keep the prote ters 

out. Protesters claimed that offi-
cers swung batons at them, but 
police accounts differ. Several 
protesters left with cuts and 
bruises. 

"My understanding is that offi-
cers were not swinging batons at 
protesting students," said Nancy 
Greenstein, director of UCPD 
Community Services. "Even 
though many of the people there 
were students, there were other 
people there and it is the job of 
the officers to protect the 
Regents. My understanding was 
that at that point, students began 
to grab at the batons and there 
was some jostling." 

During the meetings, the 
Regents approved a new board of 
directors for the Los Alamos, 
Lawrence Livermore and 
Berkeley National Laboratories in 
an ongoing effort to improve lab-
oratory management. The board 
will draw its membership from 
outside individuals with expertise 
in science and technology, nation-
al defense and business manage-
ment. 

"This action by the UC 
Regents is a signi ficant step and 
further highlights our commit-
ment to strong management of 
the national laboratories," said 
Admiral S. Robert Foley, who was 
recently appointed UC Vice 
President for Laboratory 
Management. 

The board's establishment is 
not an indication that the 
University of California will bid 
for the contract to operate Los 
Alamos after 2005, according to 
UC officials. 

"Even if the whole question of 
competition was not in the pic-
ture, we would be doing what 
we're doing with respect to the 
board," UC spokesman Paul 
Schwartz said. 

continued from page I 
bookstores even with the addition-
al international shipping fees. 

"Wu found this very troubling, 
especially with the rise of tuition," 
Johnson said. "The bill is basically 
going to see why this is going on, 
and what exactly is the disparity 
because there seems to be potcntial 
for price gouging." 

Wu's bill requires that the 
GAO investigate the college text-
book industry and report within 
one year on how much the average 
tudent pays for textbooks as well 

as the cost of producing those 
books. 

The bill also asks that the GAO 
study why there is a discrepancy of 
textbook prices between the 
United States and other countries. 
In addition, the report would look 
into the publishing companies' 
practices of printing new editions 
and investigating the price dispar-
ity between new and old text-
books. 

In response to Wu's bill and to 
the increasing scrutiny of textbook 
pricing, pulJlishers are defending 
their pricing practices. ALcording 
to the American Association of 
Publishers, textbooks are sold out-
side the United States at prices 
that reflect local market condi-
tions. 

"We have not seen the legisla-
tion, but appreciate Congressman 
Wu's concerns and welcome the 
opportunity to speak with him," 
AAP's Director of Public Affairs 
Judith Platt said. "Publishers are as 
committed as ever to delivering the 
highest quality materials to the 
higher education community." 

ccording to Platt, textbook 
pricing is complex and involves 
bookstores, publishers, professors, 
students and authors. 

"The development, production 
and distri bution of textbooks and 
related educational materials 
require significant investments," 
Platt said. "The cost of a major 
textbook ca n exceed $1 million 
before a single copy is sold. Unlike 
besr-selling consumer books, text-
books are sold to niche markets in 
relatively small quantities." 

According to Johnson, Wu's bill 
may be attached 10 the Iligher 
Education Act, which will be under 
cOl,sideration in 2004. The Higher 
Education Act covers financial aid 
laws in universities. 

"Given that this issue with 
textbook prices is relative ,0 the 
overall cost to education, we're 
hoping to attach the bill to the 
Higher Education Act," Johnson 
said. 

While Wu's bill is gathering 
support from students in Oregon, 
it is not yet certain if California 
representatives will s.ign the bill. 
According to Merriah Fairchild, 
the higher education advocate for 
the California Public Inrerest 
Research Group, discussion is 
underway. 

"We're still talking with people 
but no one else has commincd to 
the bill," Fairchild said. "The bill 
is still being drafted, so it's harder 
to gather support for it in 
Congress." 

According to Johnson, with the 
increasing concerns over rising 
costs of higher education, there 
have been generally positive reac-
tions to Wu's bill, especially from 
students. 

"The best thing for students to 
do is to contact their own con-
gressman, to tell them that this is 
an important thing and they'd like 
their congressman to pon or the 
bill," Johnson said.

Comedian 
Oat Phan: 

Topical 
funnyman or 
race-baiting 
opportunist? 

Act meant to elicit discussion of taboo issues 
By ROBIN AVERBECK 

Staff Writer 

[n the current cultural atmos-
phere of pointed ocml sensitivity, 
there is no more effective way of 
getting the politically correct 
police on your trail than to rai e 
I sues of ethnicI ty or race. The 
irony of this situation is thick -
upon arrtvll1g at school, many stu-
den are lured into believing the 
oppo ite because ethlllc Studie and 
club abound, and classes focused 
on an ethnic mlllority are even 
required for graduation . 

Ilowever, all the openness and 
education about our ethnic and 
cultural histories is extremely mis-
leading because it comes with a 
tell-tale rule: You hould consider 
and learn aboot ethnic issues, but 
only if you do so within a very 
narrowly designated field of dis-
cussion. The punishment for 
doing otherwise? Being labeled a 

bigot, raci t or at lea t ruthlessly 
manipularive. 

Such is currently the fate of 
young letnamese comedian Dat 
Phan . Already extremely success-
ful considering his short career, 
Phan visited UCSD on Nov. 17, 
and his performance provoked 
some people to complain about 
the content of his comedy, claim-
ing it degrades and insults 
Vietnamese people and their cul-
ture . Phan's advcntures have been 
chronicled on "La t Comic 
Standing," Be's American Idol -
style reality how in which come-
dian faced off (Ph an won, by the 
way). The claim that Phan's com-
edy is inappropriate or insulting is 
ridiculous and has nothing to do 
with his comedy and everything to 
do with the desire to censor those 
who step out of the politically cor-
rect box. 

Phan's style is self-described a 
"life exaggerated." Makes sense-

his routine di cuss generational 
differences within his family, 
focusing on his mother - who 
migrated to America and there-
fore still retains a more noticeable 

letnamese accent and old-fash-
ioned idea - and Phan 's own 

PRO 
Amcrican-born generation, which 
has grown up in an atmosphere of 
misconceptions and stereotypes 
despite feeling just as American as 
their white friends. The exaggera-
tion element is expressed in vari-
ous ways, but the most noticeable 
is the thick and illy imitation 
Phan does of his mother's accent. 

This i an offense of the first 
order to those who feel ethnicity 
and culture should not be laughed 
at, and is a perfect example of why 
omeone has been attacked for 

simply making fun of his own 
mother, something that no honest 
person can claim they have never 
done. 

The primary issue that is caus-
ing all the trouble is that the 
extremely sensitive "we-are-all -
victims" crowd doe not see eth-
nicity and culture as something 
one can laugh about Why not' 
Because if we laugh at our elve , 
that means we might take our-
selves a little less seriously. And if 
we do that, that means we are los-
ing pride in our unique cultures 
and letting them instead be 
abused and stereotyped by manip-
ulative comedians pandering to 
the biased majority. 

This line of logic reeks of 
paranoia and a hyper-emotional 

respon e to something that 
should actually be comforting, 
not troubling. Phan obviously has 
an acute love for his family and 
his mother, and it fits his person-
ality be t to express this by mak-
ing himself and others laugh at 
the different and pecial qualities 
that come with every ocial and 
cultural situation. Olher 
Vietnamese students find it funny 
(they ponsored hi trip to 
UC D, after all) because they 
probably relate to the experi-
ences, and other students find it 
funny because, hey, whose mom 
ha n't nagged them for not 
becoming a doctor? Phan's come-
dy actually open doors for u to 
see how we all relate to each 
other, and to see, since we all 
belong to different social and eth-
nic groups, how that affect our 
particular experiences and fo terS

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 2003 THE UCSD GUARDtAN 

ITis the season to be thankful, UC San Diego 
Sun God, Stuart collection, CALPirg deserve thanks 

Aftertaste 
Evelyn Hsieh 

T o be honest, one of my mo t frequent, easy, oh-so-fun and equally loathsome 
activities I partake in is complain-
ing. To magnify every single one 
of my teeny tiny little annoyances 
imo full-blown ordeals and to let 
everyone within earshot know 
about it. I viciously employ hyper-
bole so as to make all my troubles 
comparable to the coming of the 
apocalypse. That being said, you'd 
think that Thanksgiving would be 
my least favorite, or maybe my 
least compatible, holiday. 

\Vell, despite my year-round 
propensity to complain, I enjoy 
Thanksgiving not just for the few 
days we get off of school, or the 
bounty of roasted bird, pumpkin pie 
and cranberry sauce that I stuff my 
face \vith, but for the reason for the 
season, wruch is gratitude. Even a 
complaint-monger like me can 
think of things that I can only be 
grateful for. And it leaves me \vith a 
better feeling than excessive com-
plaining ever did. Yeah, it seems like 
I'm going to bunch into orne 
preachy and elf-righteous ram with 
a ide of cheese, about how we all 
should appreciate everything and 
anything, especially in light of the 
fire-cau ed turmoil and devastation 
th.is quarter. I'll pare you the lec-
nlre -I'm sure there \vill be plenty 
of time for that at home \vith fumi-
lies this weekend - and instead just 
elaborate on a few of the things I'm 

thankful for at UCSD. 
I'm thankful for the 

C ityshu ttle, because it makes 
goin g to school infinite ly more 
con venient. I enjoy sitting/stand-
ing and listening to the music, 
conversing with other riders, or 
just being los t in my own 
thoughts. It's like the elem entary 
school bus I never rode. 

I'm thankful for the Stuart Art 
Collection. As weird and unattrac-
tive as some of the pieces are, it adds 
a unique and cultural dimension to 
our otherwise ster-

" 

priorities, there are professors who 
seemingly just want to he your 
friend, even allowing the discarding 
o f their "professor" ti tle when stu-
dents address them. They hold 
office hours in coffee shops and chat 
with their students like it's fun; they 
understand and appreciate honesty 
when students admit to sleeping in 
on an exam. Some professors seem 
to be so intensely excited about a 
subject they've taught over and over 
again that it seems as if they are 
teaching it for the first time. It 

reminds me how 
ile-in-a-good-way 
campus. I don't 
particularly like the 
Sun God statue or 
the "giraffe-catch-
er" blue nets in the 
eucalyptus grove as 
much as the flash-
ing virtues and 
vices on top of the 
Powell Structural 
Systems 
Laboratory in 
Warren, but all of 
them contribute to 

Even amidst all the 
elevated drunkenness 
and debauchery I the 

fortunate I am to 
be at UCSD, or at 
any university at 
all. 

I'm thankful 
for CALPirg, the 
fur coat haters, 
the feminist orga-
nizations, and 
any other groups 
(minus the racist 
or exclusively 
offensive and 
obnoxious ones) 

campus turns 
positively vibrant far 
one day in May." 

a colorful and slightly kitschy and 
random atmosphere. 

Speaking of un God, r am 
thanl1u1 for the un God Festival. 
Even amid all the elevated drunken, 
ness :tnd deba uchery, the campus 

turn~ po itively vibrant for one day 
in May. I rememher the water-bal-
loon fight that broke out at Price 
Center this past year; it was a 
moment of uninhibited, joyful play-
ful ness. Its nice to see the whole 
campus leI loose once in awhile. 

I'm thankful for professor who 
seem to exude an air of genuine pas-
sion for their subject and their stu-
dents. Even though undergraduates 
probably rank low in their list of 

roughing it out 
there on Library Walk handing 
out fliers and rrailing after rushed 
and annoyed students. I am usu-
ally among those students, but I 
admire these groups for being 
anti-apathy warriors. Regardless 
of whether or not I agree with 
their cause, it kind of amazes me 
that there are some so impas-
sioned about their cause that they 
would man a lone table and hawk 
fliers day after day, despite 
inevitably brash rejection and 
reactions. 

I'm thankful for the cliffs 
overlooking Blacks Beach. 
There's also that monstrously 
magnificent mansion on the ide 

of the beach that has been specu-
lated to belong to everyone from 
the chancellor to the owner of 
Ralphs to a drug kingpin. It is 
quite a beautiful structure, but 
pales in comparison to the 
majesty of the Pacific Ocean. Just 
a five-minute walk from John 
Muir College, the cliffs offer a 
space of solace that elicits pure 
awe. The cliffs just make me 
more grateful for everything. 
Thank God for San Diego's 
beauty, for the limitless horizon 
that seemingly beckons us all 
forth to experience its wonder. 

The funny thing about thin\..-
ing up things I'm thankful for is 
that there is no limit. I can think 
of many other UCSD blessings, 
from the immensely helpful 
Career Services Center to the 
brand new game room, to the 
fuchsia flowers crawling up the 
Engineering Building Unit 2 
walls, to the quarterly Vendor Fair 
that brings familiar goods, to the 
sti ll-sparkling RIMAC, to Price 
Center movies ... see how the list 
never ends? In the spirit of the 
season, I shall suspend my bad 
habit of complaining all the time 
and hope that it will be dimin-
ished by Thanksgiving's purpose. 

Those Puritans had some-
thing going on, and it isn't a bad 
example to follow. Butterball 
turkeys and autumn decor aside, 
commercialism hasn't really 
eclipsed the meaning of 
Thanksgiving the way some 
other holidays have succumbed. 
It's a good thing, too, don't you 
think? Thanks for reading. 

Don't agree with Evelyn's flavor?

THE EDITOR 

Conservative 
opponents of Mass. 

ruling are hypocritical 
Editor: 

I can see all the conservative 
alarmists up in arms over lesbians 
and gays finally getting some equal 
rights in Massachusetts. 

They truly fear it's the downfall 
of Western civilization or, through 
some convoluted reasoning, our 
getting married to the person we 
love is somehow going to ruin their 
marriage. 

To these fearful folks, there's a 
little history lesson here. Twenty-
five to 30 yea rs ago, some of you 
and your parents continua lIy 
preached to us gay men that if we 
only would settle down and 
become less promiscuous and more 
mainstream, we would earn the 
respect we deserve. 

\,vell , millions of us are now III 
monogamous loving relationshIps, 
exactly like some of your marriages, 
and I'm going to hold you to your 
Christian word. 

And if you srill oppose either 
civil gay marriages or allowing us 
all the special privileges of marriage 
that have been bequeathed unto 
you, then I never ever want 10 hear 
you utter tho e words, "I'm for

6 PINION 

Con: Reliance on racial 
humor will hurt Phan's career 

continued fTOm page 4 
li\·ehhood. 

uch a dependence i nm healthy 
for hIs career's longevity. rceCIl[ 
expenence >vith the Koa/o has shown 
us, society's tolerance of such racial 
humor i on the decline. 

When the Koala distributed 
"Ji77lam," a publication that 
mocked 1uslim women who wear 
traditional garb, one of the most 
repeated refrains heard from 
Muslim protestors wa, ''You're 
making fun of my mom! You 
don 't under tand - the e are m)' 
sister, my mother, my aunts who 
wear this. It's an attack on all of 
them." 

During one encounter, the 
Koala responded that these mass 
protests did not happen when the 
publication mocked other ethnici-
tie or religions. The protestors 
inSIsted that if others were ever 
attacked the way they were, they 
would rally to their side as well. 

As Phan mimicked his mother 
for the umpteenth time, an audi-
ence member called out, "That's 
my mom!" Evidently, the condi-
tion was met; but the protestor 
did not follow up on their 
promise. 

o one rallied to "defend" the 

Asians being attacked by Phan. In 
fact, Phan's appearance was co-
sponsored by the letnamese 
Student Association and Sixth 
College Residential Life. The 
same people who might have 
sided with the Muslim Student 
Association against the Koala 
actually sponsortd thi similarly 
racial humor. 

Rightly or wrongly, Phan's act 
perpetuates racial stereotypes. 
There can be no doubt about that. 
However, this campus, which 
responded so quickly and decisive-
ly to the Koa/o's exploitation of 
racial humor, ignored Phan' simi-
lar transgressions. I t blindly sup-
ports him because he's a successful 
minority, overlooking the damage 
he does to perception of Asians. 
Phan 's success does not mean 
future success for Asians. Wailing 
in a fake accent about his mother 
does not open any doors. 

Phan himself is not oblivious 
to the damage he causes or the 
problems hi reliance on stereo-
types poses for his future . His 
Web site explain that he eventu-
ally plans to stop u ing racial 
"Asian material" in his act. Good 
for him - but he never should 
have started.

Pro: 
Comedian 

breaks down 
stereotypes 

continued from page 4 
understanding. 

The politically correct crowd 
also fears Phan's routine will fos-
ter the growth of stereotype 
about Vietnamese people, since 
they claim he is supporting them. 
Nonsense. Some of Phan's best 
jokes arc a bout the ridicu lous 
ideas people come up with about 
him just because he is Asian, such 
as the weird belief held by some 
that he muSt know Kung Fu. The 
exaggerated acce nt itself can be 
seen as :I comment on that vcry 
stereotype - that people laugh 
about it is a sign of everyone rec-
ognizing how unrealistic and silly 
such conceptions are. 

Bu t even further than that, 
Phan is aware such cultural clash-
es are something a person may 
come into contact with and he 
uses comedy to relieve the ten ion 
inherent in this - if we can laugh 
together about our lack of ability 
to understand what the other is 
sayi ng, then the awkwa rdness 
around the situation i removed. 

W e need to stop taking our-
selves so seriou Iy and loosen up 
enough to see how we ca n all 
relate. Phan's comedy is an example 
of this. But there are other cOllle li -
ans who do the same thing. What 
about black comedians uch as 
Chris Rock or David Chapelle, 
who discuss the personality of the 
black comm uni ty while making 
black audiences roar with laughter? 
Should they be accused of degrad-
ing blacks' 

Enriching each other, both on 
an individual and a group basis, by 
shari ng what makes uS specia l anJ 
unique' is a part of almost all rela-
tionship . Comedy, laughter -
even the ob cure concept of teas-
ing - i a prime way of commu-
nicating this . Phan use exaggera-
tion of these traits to make his 
comedy - and his me sage -
more powerful and pointed, not in 
an attempt to humiliate hi family 
or ethnicity. 

Exaggeration i not new to 
comedy - Phan's experiences just 
come in a different cultural con-
text, and his comedy is adjusted for 
that. Yet p ople want to take that 
lighthearted element of a relation-
ship and blow it up to the point 
where they claim :t is insulting :0 
an ethnicity. 

Danger is inherent in this -
discus ion limited to the political-
ly correct isn't intellectual discus-
ion at all. It is naturally censor-

ing, and has more to do with pro-
moting an agenda than serious 
dl cu sion . The feared conse-
quence of thinking outside thi 
box is appa rently ignorance or 
racism, so the issue of ethnicity 
becomes a dangerous arena where 
you don't want to lip up instead 
of a friendly allno phere where we 
Ca n all try to relate to one anoth-
er and 100 en up. 

It is K to take ethnic, racial 
and cultural issues and communi-
Cate idea about them in a po itive 
way through comedy. 

f course, this must be done In 
a spirn of friendship and toler-
ance, not of intolerance, bigotry 
or hatred.

enough with cultural dlffcrcnce~

Women: Speakers call for U.N. peacekeepers 
continued from page 2 

the truth" about Ilussein's past 
use o f chemical weapons on 
Kurds . 

In response, AI-Mufti reiterated 
that addam was "terrible," but 
that he was still Iraqi. She also 
pointed to U.S. violations of the 

eneva Convention in both wars 
on Iraq. 

"I didn't like the speakers 
becau e they were bia ed, they 
work for addam's regime, and 
their propaganda against the occu-
pation of Iraq is wrong," said Alan 
Zanga na, program directOr of the 
Kurdish Hum an Rights Watch. 
"Those ladies, both of them, work 
for addam Hussein ." 

fter A.S. President Jeremy 
Paul allagher and other modera-
tOrs quieted the confrontational 
members of the public. the pan-
elist thanked the audience for 
expres ing opposing view . 

"We like to hear from you," AI-
Khedairy said. " It is a challenge for 
us and for you." 

Some students said they were 
disturbed by the lack of respect 
shown by people who argued with 
the pancli ts . 

"It' a linle disappointing that 
some people decided to take out 
their per onal ambitions, their per-

sonal conflicts, their personal 
strifes with these women, who've 
obviously had a lot of issues going 
on," said ER freshman Heather 
Sipan. 

Before the lecture, Gallagher 
howed the panelists a copy of 

"J izzlal11: An Enterta inment 

" If the past was bad, this is 
worse. The problem is 
that we are now under 

occupation. " 
- AmaI A1-Khedairy, Iraqi art 

expert 

Magazine for the I lamic 1an," a 
publication of Tbt Koala distributed 
at UCSD twice in the last year. 

"It is an ugly people who do 
this," Al-Khedairy said. 

While AI-Khedairy said that 
such a publication "serves nobody, 
helps nobody," she added that it 
sh uld not embarras or intimidate 
students. Univer ity rudents, he 
said, should be able to distinguish 
between facts and lies. 

"They were kind of floored at 
the idea of how this can be allowed, 
how we can let this happen," 
Gallagher aid. "We explained thal 
it's unconstitutional for us not to 
allow it to happen." 

A.S. Public Relations Director 
Shahdeh Ammadi, who was 
involved in organizing the event, 
said that "Jizzlam" might have led 
to a larger turnout for the program. 

"Acrually, now I'm thinking it's 
a good thing we have the &ala," 
Arnmadi said. "It 's actually giving 
[sntdentsl a reason to come to these 
speaker programs to see what the 
truth is about." 

The last person to ask a ques-
tion was a Gulf War veteran who 
apologized to the panelists for his 
involvement in what he considered 
an "immoral war." He later 
embraced both peakers. 

" [t's very painful," AI-Mufti 
said. "1 wish nobody would have 
this feeling, ever." 

The A.S. Council organized and 
funded the program >vith $750 in 
re ponse to a resolution in support 
of the UCSD Principles of 
Community it pas ed in June. 

"I'm sllre everyone that was in 
that room left >vith something," 
Ammadi said. "That's what makes 
it speciaL"

Librarians: Union concludes contract, forfeits right to sympathy strikes 
continued from page r 

ewly addcd terms of principal 
investigator status, which were 
among the union's requests, was a 
ignificant gain. The principal inves-

tigator section allows librarians or 
researchers who apply for grants to 
be their own principal investigator 
and not require applicants to find an 
Academic Senate ponsor hip. 

However, the univer ity reject-

ed the union's bid for automatic 
emeritus staTUS for librarians after 
retirement. Librarians who retire 
afte r 10 years of service will receive 
benefits equivalent to non- enate 
emeriti , such as access to campus 
housing assistance, reduced park-
ing fees, active e-rnai l accounts and 
facility aece s. 

"The univer ity, a well as UC 
lecturers, service worker , clerical 

employees and now the librarians 
all agree that these provisions cover 
the tandards needed," UC 
spokesman Paul chwartz said. 

The university gained ground 
with a ban on sympathy Strikes 
included in the contract. Sympathy 
strikes are protests by workers to 
support the cause of another strik-
ing group. UC librarians have the 
right to participatc in activities, but 

only on personal non work time. 
"(Giving up sympathy srrikes] 

was something that was difficult to 
do," Goral said. "It does not mean 
that we cannot support the activities 
of the other unions. It JUSt means 
that we can not withhold labor." 

A new provision introduced the 
idea of hourly intermittent librari -
ans. This section creates the job 
title of "sub titute librarian" and 

allows the univer ity to hire librar-
ians on an hourly basis. 

The leave of ab ence article was 
also updated to include "domestic 
parmer" as a legal definition of 
family members. Also, a new "cata-
strophic leave" program will allow 
people to donate vacation time to 
colleagues who are going through 
health crises. The new contract will 
be effecnve through ug. 30, 2006.

E d Stewart pends most of Thanksgiving day thinking and relaxing on one of the white beaches of La Jolla. Around midafternoon , he catches the bus to a 
Thanksgiving dinner offered to San Diego homeless resi-
dents like him elf. 

"ft's alway a nice set-up, no matter where I go," Stewart 
aid, as he tood on Girard treet in downtown La Jolla. 

"There are more volunteers this time of year, and most every-
one is in good spirits." 

According to the Stewart B. McKinney Homele s ct, a 
per on is considered homeles when he "lacks a fixed, reg-
ular and adequate nighttime re~idence and has a primary 
nighttime residency that is: a supervi ed or publicly or pri-
vatelyoperated helter designed to provide temporary liv-
ing accommodations; an institution that provides a tempo-
rary residence for individuals intended to be institmional-
ized; or a public or private place not designed for human 
beings."

Homeless for 
the Holidays 

The holiday season garners many 
volunteers and donations, but homelessness 
in San Diego is a year-round problem 

laborers who live in the northern canyon, hill and fields. 
Stewart, 39, has been homeless for six year after losing his 

job and family to drug addiction. He ha been in and out of 
therapy and shelters during hi time on the streets. li e 
believes that the winter season make an Diego residents 
feel particularly altruistic. 

"One thing thar's nice around the holidays are the extra 
donation ," tewart said. "It's a mu h different time of year." 

St. IIlcenr de Paul Village, one shelter network tewart 
said he ha utilized for a i rance, is a large resource f, r an 
Diego's home Ie s. Its two Thanksgiving meals erved on ov. 
26 wi ll feed over 2,000 homele . 

"Thanksgiving day meal for the less fortunate are a dime-
a-dozen in this city," said Father Joe Carroll, president of the 
village. "But the thousands of homeless and underserved 
members of our community need wann meals and nouri h-
ment year-round, and t. Vincent's meets that need by pro-
\~ding meals each and every day of the year - not just on 
popular holidays." 

'har n Johnson, director of the City of an Diego', 
Ilol11elcss Shelter dmini,rrati n ',,\-'inter helter Project, 
agrees that the holidays bring m re volunteers. The project, 
a large-scale homeless service eAoft during the winter cason,

vide hundreds of bed, ount-

Ics~ meals and ther cmploy-

" \\'e developed the \',,'inter

Families repre ent a quarter of an Diego's homeles. pop-
ulation and the majority are headed by women who are 
dome tic abu e victims. Movements like the Monarch 

chool, located in downtown an Diego, and rand p For 
Kids were founded to help nearly 2,200 homele 5 youth - an 
estimated 00 of whom are on their own. 

The Monarch chool blo somed from a mall drop-in 
center the an Diego ounty Office of Education funded for 
homeless youth in 1988. The Progressive Learning 
Alternative for Children's Education was staffed with a single 
teacher, despite the number of homeless youth it attracted. In 
1996, P.L.A.C.E. expanded to include an academic curricu-
lum for junior high and high chool Stu tents, and tutoring 
and ment ring programs wcre in t'alled. In 1998. it W'15 
renamed the Monarch chool, and by 200 I. it oper-.ned with 
a computer lab, three cla>sroom • a health clinic, a lunch 
room, a kitchen. a laundry room lnd 'ho\\er made pos ible 
by donation~ and SDCOE funding. 

Each cason, the Monarch cbool hosts easonal celebra-
tion for the students, from Thanksgiving to Chrisona~, 
Kwanzaa and 1 Ianukkith. rand p For Kids also ho ts uch 
seasonal cclebmtions, but, like the ,\-Ionarch School, it work:. 
at its efforts ye,lr-round.

" \I\'e are here to benetlt the kids, and each one i :111 ill(li-

center and make a fun, fe tive aono phere." 

Remembering oille of the Illost popular gift that were

B I COLLEGE SURVIVAL GUIDE 
Stay healthy this season despite finals stress, cold weather and cafeteria food 

By VINEESHA MALKANI 
Contributing Writer 

It eems like just yesterday that 
the quarter began, but already the 
pressure of finals is quickly 
approaching. For the weeks when 
schoolwork tends to take over your 
life, it's difficult to care about any-
thing except success in your classes. 
You sta rt to lead an abnormal lifc, 
forgetting a meal here and there or 
adopting vampire-like sleeping 
habits. Often, you don't even real-
ize the effect a\l this studying ha 
had until it's too late and the sneez-
ing a\l ovcr your note and constant 
coughing has begun . 

"vVhcn you are stressed, your 
body's immune response is proba-
bly hindered. Combined with lack 
of sleep or food, your body i more 
prone to 'catch' the common cold 
or Au," said Jason Lam, srudent 
pharmacist at the UCSD School of 
Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical 
Sciences. 

Luckily, by implementing these 
imple precautions into your daily 

crosswordsolutions

routine, you ca n avoid possible 
encounters with dreaded sicknesses. 

Sleep - Let's be real here 
Though it is the most relaxing 

and stress-free thing to do, who has 
hours on end to kill JUSt lying in 
bed when you have a midterm and 
two papers due in the next two 
days? While sleep may seem like 
the easiest thing to give up when 
time becomes scarce, losing sleep is 
one of the worst things you can do 
to your body. When you don't get 
enough sleep, you lose your abi lity 
to focus and your body doesn't have 
the rest it requires to fight off sick-
nesses. A full eight hours of sleep 
may sound like a far-off goal, but 
try to spend your time awake more 
efficiently to get as much sleep as 
possible. 

"I f you find that you srudy the 
best late at night, make sure you get 
six to eight hours of sleep. Students 
often push three to four hours 
when they're stressed," Lam said. 

Plenty of sleep is vital to your 
health, and even shorr naps can re-
energize you for a night of srudying. 

Food - T he good s tuff 
College srudents tend to forget 

what's right to cat when Mom isn't 
there to cook it for them, and you 
can't live off Doritos, Top Ramen, 
I [Ol Pockers and Cherry Coke for-
ever. The keys to eating right are 
making sure you find time to eat 
and maintaining a well-balanced 
diet. Student Health utritional 

crviees' "Recipe for Success" sug-
ge rs that having a well-balanced 
diet means following the food pyra -
mid, cutting back on portion sizes,

and eating more heart-healthy 
foods such as fruits and vegetables 
and fewer junk food item and 
sweets. 

"Students that resort to a take-
out diet of Domino's and hamburg-
ers are susceptible to fatigue from 
over-eating, weight gain and a 

high-f~t diet," said Russell Luke, 
another student pharmacist. 
"Conversely, students that skip 
meals are also ubject to fatigue and 
a lower immune response." 

Eating right will give you the 
energy and nutritional value you 
need to get you through your days 
without getting sick. 

Vitamins More th an 
Flintstones chewables 

Although swallowing a small pill 
may seem useless, taking vitamins 
can acrually help you stay healthy 
and ward off genns. 

"We often hear about certain 
vitamins, such as vitamin C, or 
herbs such as Echinacea that ca n 
help," Lam said. "For students in 
their early 20s, it is helpful and 
important to at least take a multivi-
tamin on a daily basis." 

Taking a multivitamin daily to 
boost your energy gives your body 
everything it needs but is denied 
through dining hall meals. When 
you get sick of drinking orange juke, 
or your friends and roommates Start 
to get sick, make sure you have a 
ta h of extra vitamins to 'protect you 

against Au-{:ausing genns.

doing it just to make a fashion 
statement. They know that keeping 
the body hydrated is an easy way to 
stay healthy. 

"Drink lots of water and less 
soda, caffcinated drinks and juice.," 
Luke said. "Water also prevents 
headaches caused by dehydration 
and helps to eliminate toxins and 
impurities in your body faster." 

It's better to have too much 
rather than too little water in your 
system, so buy a case and drink up! 

Fresh air - Wear a jacket if you 
need to! 

Trapped in a stuffy dorm room 
is no way to stay healthy, so be sure 
to open your window, even if it's 
cold outside. The open window 
will provide an escape route for 
germ-filled air and an entrance for 
the fresh air you love to breathe. 

Exercise - It does more than 
make you buff 

Student Health recommends 
exercising for at least 30 minutes 
three times per week. By trekking 
all the way to RIMAC or Main 
Gym, you' re doing yourself a favor, 
especially during finals time, 

because exercise prOVides a good 
break from the stress of studying. 

"Exercising will help you main-
tain a healthy immune system, 
weight control, increase energy 
levels, reduce the symptoms of 
stress, and it is something that will 
benefit you for the rest of your 
life," Luke said. 

Common Sense - You have it, 
so use it 

Remember to keep your distance 
from other people infected by conta-
gious genns and keep your mouth 
off of their drinks. Also, wash your 
hands several times a day. These arc 
simple ways to avoid the spread of 
germs. Use your be t judgment 
because even little actions on your 
part can playa big role in stay-
ing healthy. After all, no one 
can afford to get sick during 
finals crunch time. 

However, Lam also 
recommends that you 
"balance the studying 
with fun . 0 
effort .---. 
should go 
unreward-
cd."

Nationals: Firouz finishes 
34th out of 189 runners 
continued from page ,6 

The remajning runners on the 
men's side were sophomore Carl 
Lo trom (1IIth, 34:26.1) and 
eruor Eric ilsen (153rd, 35:37.3), 

On the women's ide, fre hman 
Tina Firouz, the tOP UC D per-
former throughout the 2003 cam-
paign, achieved spectacular results 
at nationals. 

Resolutely pushing forward 
from the main pack from the start, 
Firouz crossed the line 34th out of 
189 total runners. 

Firouz po ted an excellenr rime 
of 22:33.6 for the 6,000 meter 
course. lIer performance earned 
All-American recognjrion from the 
Cross Country Coaches' 
Association, adding to Firouz' ub-
tantiallist of first-year eros -coun-

try accolades. 
Following Firouz were sopho-

more Mjchellc DiMeo, who made 
sigillficant progress throughout the 
season and took Oth with a time of 
23:29.8 in her first 1 CAA meet, 
junjor Lindsay Stalker, pursuing a 
suong sea on finisher by placing 
93rd with a time of 23:45.8, sopho-
more Erin O'Donnell (1 14th, 
24:08.2) and senior Lillian 
Gardjner (II th, 24:09.3). 

Pursuing the point-scorers 
closely were seniors Amanda 
Felder (137th, 24:22.3) and Kathy 
Read (149th, 24:47.7), 

Running in warm, sunny con-
ditions on a hilly, winding course 
that coach Ted Van Arsdale called , 
"one of the hardest we've encoun-
tered at the nationals," neither 
team held back in the first attempt 

together in the Division 11 
ationals, 
Adams tate won the men's 

event at nationals with 40 points, 
followed by Abilene Christian (68 
points), Harding (86 point), 
Chico State (147 point) and 
Western State, which tallied 150 
points. 

Adams State (38 points) also 
won the women's championship, 
followed by Western State (101 
points) and Grand Valley tate 
(143 points) . UCSD' regional 
rival Chico State ended up with 
20 I points, and in fifth place was 
Harding (264 points). 

The men's and women's teams 
each featured a field of 24 teams, 

The Adams State men were 
headed by Celedonio Rodriguez, 
who took the inwvidual ti tie, lead-
ing the Colorado school to its 17th 
national title. The Grizzly 
women s victory was thei r 12 th all 
time. This year's competition 
marks the seventh time Adams 
State has atoned both men's and 
women's titles. 

Historically potent powerhouse 
UC Davis was ineligible for com-
petition for the meets this past 
season due to their impending 
reclassification to Division [, 
thereby slightly lightening the 
typically competitive nature of 

ationals. 
The collective performances of 

both the UCSD men's and 
women's teams at adonals 
capped off a solid sea on, and they 
look to progress even further next 
ea on.

Dethroned: LMU's Elliot stops the Tritons 
continued from page ,6 

ing 20 seconds of the half, making 
it a one-point game when the 
clock expired. 

The Tritons could not contain 
Barr as he entered the water in the 
third quarter and scored the first 
goal of the period at the 4:44 
mark, reestablishing hjs team's 
two-goal lead and keeping the 
prospect of tying the game out of 
reach for the Tritons. 

Finegold was able to keep 
UC 0 in striking di tance, howev-
er, with a man-up goal in the 
Tritons' next offensive opporrurlity. 

The closest that the Tritons 
came to leading the game was the 
fourth-quarter tie made possible by 
Borsos score just 23 seconds into 
the quarter, locking the game up at 
four apiece. For the fir t time since 
the start of the game, ,,~th the 
WWPA title and an NCAA cham-
pionsrup tournament berth on the 
line, it was anybody's game. 

The next two minutes wen' cru-

cia! for the Tritons, but rurned out 
unfruitful . Less than a minute fol-
lowing Borsa's goal, LMU opho-
more Endre Rex-Kiss put rus team 
up with a score at the 5:43 mark. 
The Tritons rod not respond before 
jwuor Sean Wimer placed LMU's 
final goal in the net at the 4:44 
mark in the final quarrer, gi~ng 
LMU the 6-4 advantage. 

With two minutes left in the 
period, juruor driver Chris 
Eicholz managed to bring UCSD 
within one. The Tritons were 
unable to tally a tying goal to send 
the match into overtime. 

The Tritons' offen e was sti-
fled by an impressive performance 
by the Lions' Ian Elliot, who post-
ed nine saves in the game, many of 
which took place on lriton coun-
terattacks and high-percentage 
scoring oppommities, While the 
Tritons were able to run their con-
sistently effective counterattack, 
Elliot either blocked the shots or 
the Tritons missed crucial 

attempts that held the outcome of 
the game. 

Hopkins was named the 2003 
Western Water Polo Association's

Young team hopes to be a contender Final Four: UCSD set to play No.7 Franklin Pierce 
By MATT RYAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The beginning of every season 
brings hope and promi e that the 
men's basketball team will be play-
ing late in the sea on whjle others 
are sitting at horne. 

La t year's record wa 7-20, 
which included a uetch with nine 
straight losses. Greg Lanthier 
opens up his tenth year as UC D's 
head coach with an c.xtremely 
young ream - eight freshmen, 
four sophomore , two junior and 
one enior. 

There are only five returning 
pla),er on the roster: enjor 
Cameron Jackson and sopho-
more Adam Snyder, Matthew 
Sweany, Zach Zanolli and 
Matthew anti. Despite being 0 
young, this team can still play ball. 

Originally, the Tritons' first 
test of the season was upposed to 
be again t University of La Verne 
at home, but UCSD and RIMA 
Arena were selected to host the

event which ran ov. 20 through 
Nov. 23. a result, the Tritons 
had made the rrek up to La Verne 
to open the season. 

Despite uaveling, the Tritons 
came out ready to play on ov. 21 
at La Verne, but Lanthier's young 
squad suffered its fir t defeat in a 
thrilling 81-78 game. either 
team led by more than three

Free throws were crucial in the 
game. The Leopards went 13-16 
from the line and did not miss 
down the stretch . The Tritons 
were able to stay close throughout 
based on the play of Snyder, who 
scored 20 points and pulled down 
a team-high nine boards, but it 
was not enough to get them past 
the Leopards. In his debut, 6-

toward Jones, who was stati ned in 
frOnt of the net. Jones fli<.:ked the 
ball onward and it eluded the 
Meuo tate goalie, sneaking past 
the goal Jjne. 

"I just put it in the mixer to see 
what would happen," Jones said of 
her flick, which looked to be a 
potential pass. 

But Metro tate countered with 
a header from Mei ha Pyke. 

Losing their lead did not 
dec rea e the intenSIty of the 
Tritons. Just one mjnure after 
Metro State's equalizer, Jones 
scored the game winillng goal. Off 
of a corner bv eruor mid fielder 
Amy Goker,Jo~es ran near POSt and 
leaped into the air to get a head on 
the cross. 

Up 3-2 with 25 minutes to play, 
UCSD had to play defensively the 
rest of the match, including 
numerous set pieces where Merro 

State sent everyone but the goalie 
mto the box in desperatt: attempts 
to square the match. 

''I'm a pressure player, most of us 
are," Poma said, "\.\'e picked our 
heads up after [Metro tate') goals." 

Scoring three goals against per-
haps the best defense they have 
faced all year didn't take any special 
preparations. 

"We JUSt keep playing the way 
we play," ,\.IcAIanus said. ''This 
point in the season you don't 
change things. I've made that mjs-
take before." 

In addition, Jones enJoyed hav-
ing home field advantage. 

"These pa t three [home! 
games couldn't have been any bet-
ter," Jones said, "It was a one 
o'clock on a Sunday with good 
weather, and our fans were here." 

UCSD will now travel to 
Virginia Beach, Va., for the 

CM Division II Final Four. 
Their sem'ifinal opponent will be

No.1 women's volleyball upset by HPU 
Tritons' season ends after five-set match in regionals 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UC 0 men 's cross coun-
try team finished 15th and the 
women' quad placed 16th at the 
NCAA Division II ational 
Championshi ps held Nov. 22 in 
North Carolina. 

Senior Julian ahan of the 
men's team, who turned in a series 
of outstanding races in the champi-
onship season, led the Triton men, 
placing 45th in the 176-runner 
field with a time of 32 minutes, 
45 .8 seconds for the IO,OOO-meter 
course at SAS Soccer Park in Cary, 
N .C. 

Nahan ran in a group with his 
teammates early in the meet, but 
he pushed ahead of the pack in the 
middle of the race and managed 
to pace the Triton men. 

Neil Kalra , who was the Triton 
men's o. I runner for a majority 
of the sea on, was the squad's sec-
ond finisher, placing 77th overall 

~.<i clocking in 3 time of 33:32.9. 
Three other point- corers were 

important to the team's success. 
They included senior John 
10rrison, who came in 87th place 

with a time of 33 :45 .2, jUnior 
Robert Eap ( l04th, 34:17.5) and 
sophomore Chris Beedey-Hagler 
(105 th, 34: 17. ).

Senior Staff Writer 

The stage was set perfectly for 
a third meeting between top-
seeded UC 0 and conference 
rival Cal State San Bernardino in 
the West Region final for a berth 
into the national quarterfinals. 
There was just one problem: 
Hawaii Pacific U niversity had 
other plan . 

The fifth- eeded ea Warriors 
of Hawaii Pacific upset the 
favored Tritons in a thrilling five-
game match (29-3 1,30-24,3 1-29, 
23 -30 and 18-16) in the regional 
semifinal. The loss da hed 
UCSD's championship hopes. 

Hawaii Pacific defeated 
fourth-seeded Cal tate 
Bakersfield, 3-2, to reach the 
semi-finals. Occupying a place 
that could have belonged to the 
Tritons in the regional final, the 
Sea Warriors were no match for 
the Coyotes of Cal State San 
Bernardino who won 3-0 (30-28, 
30-21, 30-22) and will represent 
the West Region in the Elite 
Eight. The Coyotes defeated a 
spunky Seattle University squad, 
3 -I, in the first round and sec-
ond-seeded Western 
Washington, 3 -I, to reach the 
finals . 

At the outset, it appeared that 
the Tritons could not be deterred 
from their goal to advance as 
match-opening 010 blocks by 
opposite Lindsay Crandell and 
middle blocker Kendra Canape 
gave UCSD the early lead and 
energized the crowd of 826. 

The Tritons continued to 
push through the first game, and 
held a four-point lead as late as 
27-23 with the offense paced by 
middle blocker Katie Hogan's 
five kills. Hawaii Pacific stormed 
back to tie the score at 27 , and 

the teams traded points up to 29. 
Canape and Wilson put down 
back-to-back kills to give UCSD 
the game. 

It looked as if the Tritons 
might cruise to victory, but the 

ea Warriors played at a whole 
new level in the second game, 
racking up 20 kills with JUSt three 
errors en route to a 30-24 win. 
UCSD head coach Duncan 
McFarland gave the credit to 
Hawaii Pacific for the turn-
around. 

"I think any good team can do 
that, and once again they knew if 
they wanted to have a shot, they 
had to play better," he said . 
"Good teams are capable of turn-
ing things around." 

The Triton block cooled the 
Sea Warrior attack in game three, 
with UCSD tallying five of its 14 
blocks overall. Canape - who 
served as an emotional sparkplug 
for the team - was part of each 
of the five blocks, but in the end 
the Tritons could not overcome 
their poor .140 attack percentage 
in the game. They fell to Hawaii 
Pacific, 31-29. 

Though Canape's exuberant 
play and high level of intensity 
went unquestioned, the UCSD 
team as a whole seemed to lack 
some of the high energy and 
focus that a playoff match 
deserves. McFarland attributed 
the lack of focus and energy to 
disturbing events leading up to 
the match. 

" I think there were definitely 
some people who had nerves 
tonight who knew what a big 
match it was," McFarland said. 
"The fact that Lind ay [Crandell ] 
dislocated her finger and frac-
tured it a few days ago, that was 
kind of un ettling for the whole 
team ... we had a couple things 
like that that put us on edge a lit-
