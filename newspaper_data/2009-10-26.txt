John Muir College students voted Friday to pay 
an additional $4 per quarter in activity fees, begin-
ning March 2010. 

Roughly 29 percent of the increase will go toward 
financial aid for Muir students. The remainder will 
fund Muir College activities like Muir Musical, 
Muirstock and the bi-quarterly N.E.R.D. LAN Party. 

The referendum included a clause barring the 
Muir College Council from raising 
fees again until 2013.

Councilmembers made a simi-
lar bid to raise fees last year, but 
the referendum — included on the 
2009 A.S. election ballot — failed.

The first proposal would have 
only raised the fee from $7 to $10, 
but included a clause that raised 
fees by $2 every two years until 
2014. 

Despite an extensive informa-
tional-poster campaign led by the 
MCC, the Spring Quarter refer-
endum didn’t get by student vot-
ers, and only made the 20-percent 
voter participation requirement by 
1 percent. 

This year’s referendum passed 
with 1,008 — or 24 percent — of Muir students turn-
ing out to vote.

According to MCC Financial Advisor Frank 
Chang, a main contributor to the passing of this 
year’s referendum and the failure of last year’s was 
the level of campaigning by both the MCC — which 
oversees funding for the entire college — and Muir 

Depleted college resources make 
passing referendum a priority for 
cash-strapped Muir student orgs.

Though financial reports indicate the national eco-nomic crisis may have an 
end in sight, recent college gradu-
ates are finding little reassurance 
in the face of dismal employment 
opportunities nationwide.  

“We are looking at a challeng-
ing job market for students grad-
uating this year,” Career Services 
Center director Andy Ceperley 
said. “Nationally, employers are 
predicting a 7-percent drop in 
campus recruitment compared to 
last year.” 

These worsening conditions 
coincide with a 26-year high in 
national unemployment. 

In early 2008, the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics reported unem-
ployment rates of around 5 per-
cent; however, joblessness shot up 
over the last year and now hovers 
at around 10 percent.

This discomforting reality 
is a result of a global recession 
that began in September 2008. 
According to the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics, about 6.7 million 
jobs have been lost nationwide 
since the start of 2008.

LIGHTS AND SIRENS

Residential Council, which puts on 
many of the major events for Muir 
residents. 

Because the MCC must remain 
officially impartial on issues like 
these, the council ran an informa-
tional campaign. Representatives in 
the Muir Quad encouraged students 
to vote, and reminded them of the 
upcoming ballot deadline. 

“MRC decided to run the pro 
campaign for the referendum that 
MCC couldn’t,” Lagano said. “MCC 
had $75 for a pro campaign and $75 
for a con campaign, so we took what 
MCC gave us and made fliers and 
put them up all over school.”

The council omitted the annual 
$2 increase clause from this year’s 
referendum. According to Chang, 
due to a drop in the council’s reserve 
funds — from $18,000 at the start of 
last Spring Quarter to around $8,000 
now — running the referendum, 
even without the clause, was critical if 

the MCC wanted to continue funding 
student events as pricey as Muirstock.

“Historically speaking, we’re sup-
posed to put money back into our 
reserves, from our revenue, but we 
haven’t been able to do that in the 
past four years because of the amount 
of money that we aren’t getting from 
A.S.,” Chang said. 

In 2005, the A.S. Council declared 
financial independence from the six 
college councils, agreeing to fund all 
campuswide student activities and 
leaving the colleges to finance only 
internal events and organizations, 
like Marshall College’s annual music 
festival Marshallpalooza or Muir’s 
Weekends at Muir.

A.S. President Utsav Gupta said 
the split was due in part to a convo-
luted funding-request process.

“I remember, when I was a first- 
year, going around to seven or eight 
different bodies just to ask for fund-
ing for one event, so it did make it a 
lot harder to actually throw an event,” 

Gupta said. “So, the deal was that col-
lege councils would no longer have to 
fund all-campus organizations if they 
didn’t want to, and A.S. would pick 
up all of the funding for all-campus 
student organizations.”

The elimination of this funding 
prompted the college councils to 
begin raising individual activity fees.

Now that Muir’s referendum has 
passed, MRC co-chair Robin Sablove 
is optimistic about the council’s abil-
ity to better fund student events and 
organizations.

“MCC used all their money.” 
Sablove said. “So if the fee increase 
hadn’t occurred, they wouldn’t have 
any money to give us… like, [Muir 
Theatre] will now be able to get those 
lights to put on their production, or 
an organization will be able to get that 
funding they need, now that MCC will 
have money for us to request.”

60,000 eyes & other good reasons.

Last year, economics professor 
Richard Carson told the Guardian 
that he did not expect any improve-
ments in the near future. However, he 
recently suggested that the worst may 
have already passed. 

“My impression is that this year 
will not be much better than last year,” 
Carson said. “However, there is a clear 
sense that the economy is turning 
around, and it may be better by the 
spring, when most students start look-
ing for jobs. Over the longer run, the 
job situation looks more optimistic 
than it did a year ago.” 

Federal Reserve 
Bank of San Francisco 
Vice President John 
Fernald offered a simi-
lar viewpoint in his Oct. 
13 economic report.

“There are clear 
risks to the outlook, 
and some indicators 
continue to decline — 
most notably, employ-
ment,” the report said. 
“Nonetheless, the pace 
of job losses is slowing. 
In the first half of the 
year, employment fell 
by more than half a 
million jobs a month. 
In August, employment 
fell only 216,000.” 

According to a 
September report by the 
National Association 
of Colleges and Employers, teaching 
jobs top the list of strong employment 
opportunities for recent college gradu-
ates. Previously, the No. 1 position was 
held by management and sales jobs.

The report also said that over the 
past year, the average yearly salary for  
recent college graduates has decreased 
from $49,224 to $48,633. 

A study by CareerOneStop — an 
organization that offers career infor-
mation and resources  — anticipated 
tremendous growth in job opportuni-

ties for computer software engineers 
in California. Employment numbers 
are expected to rise from 87,300 to 
128,400 — a 47-percent increase. 

“We are finding that opportunities 
for our technical graduates remain 
strong,” Ceperly said. “Our Oct. 29 
Triton Science and Technology Job 
and Internship Fair is generating 
favorable employer interest.” 

According to NACE, 43 percent 
of employers expect to continue hir-
ing as many college graduates as 
they did last year, while 17 percent of 
employers aim to increase hiring, and 

40 percent of employ-
ers predict they will 
decrease the number 
of recent graduates on 
their payroll. 

“Traditionally, 
employers tend to be 
conservative about 
their college hiring 
when the economy 
is in flux,” NACE 
Executive Director 
Marilyn Mackes said in 
the report. “Although 
employers anticipate 
doing most of their 
recruiting in the fall, we 
are seeing some move-
ment to recruit in the 
spring. This is likely due 
to anticipation that the 
economic recovery will 
be underway by then.” 

As many gradu-
ates wait for the economy to pick up, 
Ceperley recommended building 
work experience and credibility rather 
than going back to school. 

“Students should look at post-
graduate internships, fellowships and 
other ways to build their credentials, 
demonstrate their work ethic and 
establish important connections,” 
Ceperley said. “Some will inevitably 
choose to dive right into graduate or 
professional school. This is not neces-
sarily the best solution unless the stu-

dent is focused and has a clear sense 
of their options when the advanced 
degree is completed. Simply waiting 
out a weak economy in school is sel-
dom the wisest tactic.” 

Revelle College alumnus Jimmy 
Lee, who graduated from UCSD last 
June, chose to pursue an internship 
when he was unable to land a full-
time job in the management or con-
sulting industries after leaving school. 

“I think internships — rather than 
part-time positions — are definitely 
preferred by companies, since it’s 
essentially free labor,” Lee said. “For 
me, it’s helped me get my foot in the 
door of the type of industry I’d like 
to work in, make important connec-
tions with people that I might work 
with in the future and learn valuable 
skills that can only be learned at a 
workplace.” 

According to a survey conducted 
by the Career Services Center — from 
a pool of recently employed gradu-
ates who completed their degrees 
between December 2007 and June 
2008 — 29 percent successfully found 
jobs through internships or other 
previous experiences, 26 percent used 
online resources, 21 percent contacted 
employers directly and 15 percent 
found employment through network-
ing. 

Ceperley said graduates should 
remain optimistic about their options, 
no matter what profession they are 
seeking. 

“So few employment destinations 
are directly aligned to college major,” 
he said. “Outside of engineering, 
computer science and economics, 
graduates traditionally pursue a wide 
range of employers — from business 
to communication to education and 
nonprofit. A college degree from 
an excellent institution like UC San 
Diego is a plus, regardless of the aca-
demic discipline.”

With SlutFest 2009 (read: Halloween) nearly behind us, a string of warm ‘n’ 
fuzzy holidays await. It’s during this 
magical time of year that I normally 
scour the Web for evidence of human-
ity’s altruism. But, sadly, with every 
holiday miracle comes a crime report 
featuring an everyday psychopath to 
steal old St. Nick’s thunder. 

Leading off the season, we have a 

newly dumped Portland misfit who 
broke into his ex-girlfriend’s house 
to beg for another chance. After her 
immediate rejection, he pushed her 
against a wall, whipped out a knife 
and stuck it to her tiny pet fish. 

In case you didn’t learn your les-
son from “Fatal Attraction” (the ’80s 
thriller in which Glenn Close boils her 
ex-lover’s pet rabbit in a jealous rage) 
don’t let this happen to you. 

It’s tougher than it sounds. The 
world teems with those obsessive 
Facebook stalkers who just happen to 
glance at a Friday night dance party 
you’re attending and — by sheer coin-
cidence — rain on your bump-and-
grind parade. 

But hold your judgment a quick 
second — we’ve all been that jealous 
dumpee at some time. One day you’re 
in your boyfriend’s delicious BMW, 
surveying all the poor single people 
trudging to the shuttle stop, and the 
next day you’re alone with “Tyra” and 
a silent phone, asking Ben & Jerry 
what you could have possibly done to 
deserve this. 

It bites to be left in the dust, but 
after a few weeks as the stereotypical, 
See’s box-throwing dark princess, you 
too can bounce back.

When the tables turn, however, 
and you become the dumper (aka 
heartless bitch), it’s easy to shrug off 
that miserable abyss you’ve pushed 
your ex-lover into and jump back into 
the brawny embrace of college single-
hood. For me, Christmas came early 
last year after my breakup: two apart-
ments full of frat-guy testosterone 
moving into our hallway. Deck the 
halls, baby!

But if your ex’s pathetic cries are 
still drowning out the silver bells, it’s 
time to pull the plug on those weekly 
sympathy heart-to-hearts. 

Acknowledge that you’re the rea-
son for his bucketful of tears — if you 
seem oblivious to your ex’s pain, he 
will do everything possible to drown 
you in it. But also recognize that you 
don’t have to hold his hand while he’s 
dabbing his tears — that’s in his mom’s 
job description, not yours.

While the bloody goldfish made it 
stupidly obvious that our aforemen-
tioned Web felon’s deranged behavior 
screamed “restraining order,” it might 
not be so crystal clear when your 
average ex has crossed the threshold 
of obsession. After all, this is a person 
you presumably felt some scrap of 
a feeling for at one point. It may be 
difficult to recognize when he’s truly 
jumped off the deep end.

But take the time to look a little 
harder, folks, and really try to discern 
those warning signs. Because discard-
ing that old, worn-out battery before it

See REPORT� page 6

ON CAMPUS — Last Friday, Muir College stu-
dents voted to fork over another $12 per year 
to keep their college’s organizations and events 
afloat. 

However, after A.S. Council nearly doubled 
its funding last year with a pricey referendum, 
it seems college councils might be better off 
asking their rich Price Center uncle to fill 
spending gaps before scapegoating students. 

The referendum, to be instituted Spring 
Quarter 2010, will increase Muir College’s 
activity fee from $7 to $11 per quarter to offset 
the Muir College Council’s depleted reserves. 
With only $8,000 in unallocated funds as 
opposed to last year’s $18,500, the council 
needed more money for unforeseen future 
costs and those last-minute pizza study breaks 
— and they got it. 

Once upon a time — as recently as the 
2005-06 academic year — individual college 
councils sought out funding from A.S. Council, 
which is rolling in it this year with $861,500 in 
Concerts and Events funding at its disposal.

Thing is, the old system required student 
orgs to jump through seven separate funding-
request hoops to get their hands on fees, 
begging each college for a little cash before 
grovelingon the fourth floor of Price Center for 
even more. 

The overhaul, which sent those orgs directly 
to the A.S. floor, was intended to make the 
funding process simpler for everyone, college 
councils included — as they’d no longer have to 
decide how many Benjamins the knitting club 
deserves.

Currently, the colleges don’t receive 
a dime from the A.S. Council. Instead, 
every cent they spend comes from 
a separate, smaller activity fee on 
our student bills. It may be a more 
streamlined approach, but it’s also 
problematic. When college coun-
cils go broke (which happens a lot), 
there’s only one place for them to turn: 
their students. 

As anyone who’s ever witnessed a student-
cashier battle at Cafe Ventanas knows 
(doughnuts, it turns out, are actually 
$1.25), we students aren’t very willing 
to shell out. During Winter Quarter 
2009, both Muir College and Sixth 

College tried to pass marginal fee referendums 
just like this one. Muir’s failed. This time 
around, the measure just barely passed — with 
a mere 52-percent support rate. 

Four bucks a quarter may not amount to 
much more than one sacrificed Perks cap-
puccino, but — on principle — the six college 
councils should be able to petition A.S. Council 
to help fill their funding gaps before begging 
their apathetic student bodies. 

After its own lucrative referendum last year, 
the A.S. Council is the sole institution on cam-
pus with more money to spend than it knows 
what to do with. It would be far more cost 
effective to use the funding we already have 
than to tax students even more. 

A.S. President Utsav Gupta said funding 
college councils would take away from the 
money now set aside for all-campus orgs. He 
insisted all $630,000 of their allocation has 
already been set aside for one group or another 
this year. 

But even if it’s not possible for A.S. Council 
to lend Muir College Council a generous hand 
this year, it could be feasible in the future. It’s 
not impossible to rewrite A.S. legislation — 
councilmembers did it four years ago, and can 

do it again. Their self-proclaimed mission, after 
all, is to “promote student engagement in all 
areas of campus life” — and they should spread 
that involvement to all areas of campus. 

Gupta has expressed interest in doing just 
that. He wants college councils to host their 
own events the day of the Sun God Festival to 
expand the event to other parts of campus. But 
money for that has to come from somewhere, 
and A.S. has far more in reserves than do col-
lege councils. If the A.S. Council wants to see 
that type of participation, they’ll need to make 
sure it’s funded.

Before this can happen, though, the A.S. 
Council must communicate more with the 
college councils. As it stands, the councils 
themselves operate almost autonomously from 
the Associated Students. The only semblance of 
discussion between the two comes from a pair 
of senators from each college serving on both 
the A.S. Council and their respective college 
councils. 

A couple go-between figureheads can’t lead 
a real, cooperative effort to serve the student 
body — in order for that to happen, and for 
the possibility of greater collaboration and 
cash-swapping down the line, college councils 
should at least hold quarterly 
meetings with Gupta. He may 
not be the sugar daddy they 
need him to be now, but forging 
a stronger council-to-council 
connection will, in the end, push 
individual colleges’ interests to 
the forefront.

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lázaro

Dear Editor,
I respectfully dissent with 

Don Lindsay’s letter published in 
the Oct. 15 issue, entitled “New 
Campus Mural Is Politically 
Charged,” regarding the new cam-
pus mural.

First, the mural says “Health 
Care for All,” not “Government 
Health Care for All.” It never says 
whether health care must come 
from the government or from pri-
vate corporations. 

Second, there is already a place 
that displays “openly Christian 
symbols” and “faith-based 
American patriots” advocating 
stronger border security. 

It is called Texas. 
Furthermore, Lindsay’s com-

ments regarding Che Guevara are 
completely irrelevant, because Che 
is not on the mural. 

Third, diversity is neither “anti-
white” nor “anti-straight.” As a 
heterosexual white woman, I feel 
threatened by neither the new 
mural nor the gay rights move-
ment. An anti-white mural would 
say “F--- All White People” on it. 
The mural by Peterson Hall is not 
anti-white, but pro-Latino. The 
two are not necessarily the same. 
I will still be heterosexual if and 
when gay marriage is legalized 
in California; same-sex marriage 
poses absolutely no threat to my 
heterosexual identity nor to that of 
any other heterosexual. 

Lindsay protests the mural’s 
displaying of “clearly religious … 
statements,” then contradicts him-
self by saying the mural reflects 
“anti-faith” sentiments. He ought 
to make up his mind whether the 

mural is inappropriately religious 
or inappropriately secular. 

Finally, Lindsay’s description of 
the “anti-American Hispanics … 
undermining our great, traditional 
American culture” is inaccurate. 

Most, if not all, of UCSD’s 
Latino students to whom this mural 
is directed live in this country 
legally. They work hard, pay taxes 
and believe in liberty and democ-
racy as firmly as any other group of 
Americans.

Additionally, immigration is 
one of our great American tradi-
tions. This country has seen waves 
of immigrants from India, Japan, 
China, Cuba, Russia, Germany, 
Italy, Ireland and many other coun-
tries. 

All of these groups have con-
tributed positively to the nation, 
bringing new foods, languages and 
ideas to the United States. 

Welcoming these immigrants 
to our shores is an American tradi-
tion that has stood the test of time. 
Perhaps, as Lindsay is such a fer-
vent patriot, he will one day travel 
to New York City and read the 
inscription underneath the Statue of 
Liberty: “Give me your tired, your 
poor, your huddled masses yearning 
to breathe free.”

becomes a toxic pool of acid can save 
you a whole lot of cleanup time. 

Note that the fish-mauler from our 
Web story released a post-crime state-
ment saying, “If she can’t have me, she 
can’t have the fish.” By the same logic, 
a psycho ex can — and will — try to 
sabotage your chance of reeling in 
another lover.

The classic example: personal jabs 
made in public. Last year’s ex pulled 
aside my best friend and told her he 
can’t even believe he liked me because 
Hispanic girls aren’t his type.

I mean, premature 
balding isn’t really my 
cup of tea either, but 
you don’t see me whis-
pering that into his best 
friend’s ear.

Kindergarten-level 
racial slurs and other 
playground jabs reveal 
that your ex is lacking 
something key in the 
post-break-up rehab 
process: Pride. If he’s 
not even bothering to 
preserve his good-guy 
image, he’ll do any-
thing to hijack your 
attention. It’s a surefire indicator of 
his quest to tarnish your image so that 
you appear unlovable to anyone who’ll 
listen — because after all, if he can’t 
have you, no one should.

So when he starts pulling the race 
card and you — still trying to be sym-
pathetic — haven’t done the snip-snip 
yet, remember that when kids act 
their naughtiest, it means they want 
love and attention. Which isn’t your 

problem.
These blips on your lifeline, you 

must remember, are big boys. So go 
ahead and get it all out in one — I 
repeat, one — conversation. Anything 
more will only satiate his ever-burning 
desire to keep you in his life. 

Commence silent treatment.
This is especially hard for people 

who have Snow White’s desire to 
befriend all fellow humans and cuddly 
animals (example: me). But fish-killer 
has a valuable lesson to teach us all: 
The frogs you kiss before arriving at 
Prince Charming’s castle will amount 

to an eternal buzzkill 
if you let them stick 
around and make you 
feel guilty. However 
many sweet-talking 
apologies escape your 
lips, they’ll only fall on 
seething, deaf ears. 

The next time a 
breakup goes awry 
and you have to pull 
a disappearing act, 
remember: It’s for your 
own good. No one 
wants to get chewed 
out for talking to the 
hot neighbor or not 

responding on Facebook chat. To a 
scorned lover, everything you say 
will always be wrong, nothing you 
do will ever be right and no one you 
date will ever live up to his glorious 
precedent.

So when you see that drunk dial 
coming in, do yourself (and your 
Kleenex-chaffed ex) a favor and let it 
go to voicemail — life is too short to 
let the frogs overstay their welcome.

Yours Truly   
Romeo Ormskerk  

Y ou’ve seen it before: a humble request from distressed Dutch citizen Romeo Ormskerk, promising you “in absolute trust in god” he’ll place $25 million in your bank account. After all, you — a responsible college student — are as trustworthy a business partner as any. 
But no matter how many car bombs and insurgents threaten Ormskerk, he may 

have just posed an even greater threat to your computer.
Here at UCSD, a team at the Collaborative Center for Internet Epidemiology and 

Defenses — led by computer science and engineering associate professor Stefan Savage 
— has been working to halt the latest trends in cybercrime. They were recently granted 
$7 million from the U.S. Navy to continue conducting the cutting-edge research on 
botnets they began in 2008.  

This research enabled them to figure out something no one had been able to deter-
mine before: exactly how many people receive a specific spam e-mail, click on a link 
within it, and ultimately purchase that pill promising to make him longer and wider – 
or whatever product the e-mail was attempting to sell.

The latest criminal tool in 21st century drive-by downloads, a botnet is a network 
(“net”) of computers (“bot”) controlled by a spammer called the “bot master.” Once you 
download a virus, usually with an accidental mouse click, it sends out spam to all other 
computers in your network. All without leaving a trace back to the bot master. 

According to Savage, when the botnet concept emerged online in the early ’90s, it 
was only designed to send self-perpetuating insults via e-mail. However, most spam-
mers were soon “blacklisted” by anti-spam campaigns and filters or blocked from 
sending outgoing mail. They needed a new outlet to continue their attacks – one where 
they themselves wouldn’t be the target.

“The people writing worms, viruses, and malicious software and the people who 
send spam got together,” said Savage. “It was like, when you infect these machines,

BRAIN
This was the originator. Discovered in 1986, it was the first computer 
virus. And it wasn’t even meant to do any damage to your computer. 
Two brothers living in Pakistan invented Brain as a tracking program for 
illegal copies of their medical software. In the end, their bright idea to 
preempt piracy ended up inspiring far too many idle minds and infecting 
way more computers than they meant to. 

ILOVEYOU
With a subject line not many people could resist, this was one of the first 
viruses (or worm to be specific) to trick you into opening it. The actual 
virus came as an attachment. ILOVEYOU was remarkable in that it 
swept through the globe in a single day — starting off in the Philippines 
and ending up in Hong Kong, Europe and the United States before the 
sun had set over the Pacific. It caused approximately $5.5 billion in dam-
ages and forced both the Pentagon and CIA to shut off their systems.

KLEZ
Labeled by PC World as “the most prolific virus ever,” this was a com-
puter worm that swept through inboxes across the globe. It was the first 
virus to alter the “From” field of your e-mail messages, which means that 
you probably shouldn’t have been as excited as you were to open that 
e-mail from that Eastern European prince hoping to give away his mil-
lions.

MYDOOM
Hitting hard in the United States and Australia, this was the fastest-
spreading e-mail virus of all time. British Web security firm MessageLabs 
announced that it had intercepted 1.8 million copies of the worm in 168 
countries, and that 100,000 were being intercepted every hour. Most 
recently, the virus resurfaced in July 2009 to attack government, news 
media and financial Web sites in South Korea and the United States.

STORM
Storm swept through computers via e-mail spam that was estimated 
to be running on up to 50 million computers during its peak in 2007. 
Utilizing a barrage of fake attachments ranging from music offers to 
pictures of Christmas strippers, it used a remote-controlled network of 
compromised computers (a “botnet”) to continue sending infected spam.

FOCUS� MONDAY, OCTOBER 26, 2009� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 9 

I f you’re looking for an infamously chilling venue for your annual fright fix, look no fur-ther than Old Town.
Whereas every other establishment in town 

breaks out the cobwebs for an edge, the Whaley 
House doesn’t need gimmicks. No need to hire 
zombies, Bedlam patients or unnerving dentist: 
San Diego’s historical monument has been grow-
ing a staff of them for a century and a half. 

The house, built by wealthy businessman 
Thomas Whaley for his family in 1857, has sur-
vived fires, earthquakes, severe floods and two 
great depressions. More importantly for ghost 
hunters, the property has witnessed a suicide and 
multiple hangings. 

Whaley himself experienced the house’s first 
documented paranormal activity: He claimed to have seen and felt the presence of “Yankee Jim” Robinson 
— a burglar and suspected murderer –—who had been hung on the property five years before. 

Whaley House guides say some people admit to feeling pressure on their chest and neck as they walk 
up the front porch — a sensation first described by the mansion’s initial residents.

Tales like these earned the Whaley House national attention. The U.S., and the Travel Channel’s 
“America’s Most Haunted” investigators named it the No. 1 most haunted house in America.

The house is open year round, but every October, the Whaley House Museum and San Diego Ghost 
Hunters offer midnight tours for those bold enough to enter the creaking and whistling premises with 
nothing but an oil lantern.

INFOCUS SD Board Club Foam Slide

No, that waterslide you saw this past Friday wasn’t a ﬂashback of 2009 Sun God Festival debauchery. (Let’s face 
it — 2009’s Sun God wasn’t epic enough to 
warrant ﬂashbacks anyway.)

This time, there was foam. After being 
denied a place at the proverbial inn of the 
Student Center block party last Wednesday, a 
joint SD Board Club and Koala effort aimed its 
sights on Library Walk for Friday. But, after a 
classic Paul Terzino cockblock, the affair was 
relocated: Bikini- and board-short-clad folks 
were forced to trek over to Sun God Lawn, 
where the blue tarp was rolled out and the leaf 
blower turned on full blast.

HALLOWEEN IN SAN DIEGO

SITESEEN

I f you’re not privy to the 1986 murder of Cara Knott — a 20-year-old San Diego State University student — here’s how it goes: she 
was pulled over on I-15 by then-California 
Highway Patrol officer Craig Peyer during a 
traffic stop two days after Christmas. Hours 
later, she was found strangled to death in the 
canyon brush below one of the interstate’s many 
overpasses.

It’s not exactly your fireside s’more story, but 
ever since that night, the cement stretch between 
Mercy Road and Rancho Penasquitos Boulevard 
— now the Knott Memorial Bridge — has been a 
hotpsot for late-night thrill seekers. 

Though Peyer was eventually found guilty of 
the slaying and sentenced to 25 years to life, the 
story didn’t end there.

Years later, Sam Knott, Cora’s father and a 
frequent visitor to the memorial, was found 
dead in his car on the nearby onramp. He had 
suffered a heart attack.

So if you’re looking for some deadly grounds 
to plant your Ouji board, grab some candles 
and a flask of absinthe, head out to Knott 
Memorial Bridge, and let the seance begin.

The Whaley House

T hese days, 30 bucks for a quick thrill is steep — espe-cially when there’s no physical 
contact involved. At the Scream 
Zone at the Del Mar Fairgrounds, 
you’ll squeal, you’ll moan and 
you’ll get your black and orange 
undergarments in a twist, guaran-
teed (maybe even moisten them). 
Just remember, whatever you do, 
don’t “accidentally” trip and grind 
on the masked Jason — there are 
strict rules against touching the 
actors, and chances are, they’re as 
cute as the shrunken heads deco-
rating the corridors.

Take a date: If you play your 
cards right, the ghouls and goblins 
of Halloween lore won’t be the only 
things going bump in the night. A 
$27.99 fee will gain you entrance to 

all three of the Scream Zone’s haunts, but you can also pay less for just 
one or two attractions. 

The triple combo is the most cost-effective package — and, given 
the Fairgrounds’ distance from the usual seen-and-be-seen locales, 
your best bet is to make an evening of it. Go on an off-peak night, and 
save Friday and Saturday for something closer to home base.

If you decide on the Double Haunt combo, skip the relatively tame 
Haunted Hayride. Although it’ll give you an opportunity to cuddle up 
to your escort, the Chamber and House of Horror are less likely to let 
down your discerning taste for terror. Even if six years of Saw — and 
all its knockoffs — have probably desensitized your scare palate, these 
two are likely to elicit that elusive shriek from deep inside your jaded 
interior. Go under the influence, and you’ll be screaming like a new-
born by the time you turn the first corner.

Try to make it to the surprise finishes — your patience will be 
rewarded, especially if your date scares easily. The Chamber and 
House of Horror finales will be sure to have her jumping into your 
waiting arms. Might just get your happy ending after all.

Gravity Hill

The Scream Zone

Knott Memorial Bridge
Haunted Trails

A re shady roadside stops are your thing? Try Gravity Hill – an unremarkable I-805 South off-ramp. As the urban legend goes, some time back, a school bus full of kids had a horrible crash 
at the intersection in which everyone died. 

According to the myth, if you put your car in neutral at the foot 
of the Sorrento Valley Road/Mira Mesa Boulevard slope, your car 
will be pushed up the hill by a group of ghost children to prevent you 
from suffering their same fate.

Some skeptics have tried to explain away the uphill roll with 
physics, but how do they account for alleged handprints? Throw 
some baby powder on your back windshield (some sort of mind-
altering substance couldn’t hurt either) and find out for yourself.

A San Diego Halloween tradition, Balboa Park’s Haunted Trails promise goosebumps and blood curdles for all those willing to fork over the $14.99 
ticket fare. As per every October, a romp along the trail 
guarantees you’ll be chased around by a cast of actors 
dressed to the nines in scarlet-splattered rags, unkempt 
wigs and pasty makeup. 

And, of course, no Halloween attraction is complete 
without a chainsaw-wielding madman. 

The trail starts you off in a shanty school bus filled 
with dummies (who may or may not be real people) 
and takes you through a variety of garishly decorated 
sets. Bring a friend with a weak stomach to triple the 
fun — the bloody lurkers can usually spot the weakling 
of the group.

A word of advice: Avoid the park during peak week-
end hours. If the trails are congested, surprises are most 
often ruined by the group of shrill teenage girls just 
ahead of you. Unless that’s what you’re looking for.

Tickets can be purchased at the door or online 
until Oct. 31. For an additional $4.99, you can tour the 
Carnival of Carnage clown maze, a new addition to the 
trails.

instead of doing nothing, why don’t 
you set up a relay so I can send my 
e-mail through one of your machines. 
So, all this e-mail will not come from 
me. Instead, it will appear like 10 mes-
sages from the infected machines.” 

And that was the beginning of the 
cybercrime renaissance. Upon the 
success of these spammers, botnets 
became a hot commodity on the 
underground cybermarket.

“It’s cheap,” Savage said. “The going 
rate for an individual [computer] is 
not more than a few dollars. Most are 
probably just pennies. So, you can get 
1,000 computers for fairly cheap.”

According to Savage, buying 
infected computers is just like any 
other commodity market.

“You just go online, and you 
can buy compromised machines all 
over the world. ‘I want computers in 
Uruguay; I want computers in Spain.’ 
People try to send more spam during 
Christmas.”

As botnets evolved, large networks 
of compromised computers could be 
used for credit-card theft, identity 
theft and online extortion. Due to 
vague laws and differing international 
definitions regarding cybercrime, 
botnets are still a relatively new world-
wide phenomenon that remains mys-
terious to cyber-police like Savage. 

One botnet, named Storm Worm 
(for the popular subject line: “230 dead 

as storm batters Europe.”), infected 
computers from December 2006 to 
early 2008. It became the world’s larg-
est network of infected computers 
within three months of its inception, 
infecting over an estimated one million 
computers nationwide, including sev-
eral computers at UCSD. Though the 
Worm was used mainly to send spam, 
particularly for small pharmaceutical 
companies, it functioned much like 
peer-to-peer file-sharing networks such 
as BitTorrent and Kazaa. 

However, Muir College senior 
Brandon Enright, a security analyst at 
UCSD’s Administrative Computing 
and Telecommunications, said that 
these worms weren’t dangerous.

“These were not the harmful bot-
nets. The [ACMS] — the people who 
work on your computers — love the 
Worm because it’s easy to identify, and 
allows them to easily clean student 
computers.” 

Although the Storm Worm only 
infected a handful of UCSD com-
puters, Enright wanted to stop the 
botnets from returning to campus for 
good. He was able to reverse-engineer 
a “crawler” — a computer program 
that harvests e-mail addresses from 
spam — to quickly track down com-
puters in the infected network.

After developing his program, 
Enright obtained a copy of the mal-
ware in order to look further into how 
its protocol worked. After that, he was 

able to create a program that could 
infiltrate this specific variant Worm’s 
protocol. 

“I gave it one host, and it asked 
other computers to tell me about their 
neighbors. So, I contacted those [com-
puters] and asked them to tell me 
about their neighbors. Eventually, I get 
a list of every single infected computer 
on the network.”

But the crawler was by no means 
perfect. The Heisenbot Uncertainty 
Principle states that there is always 
a certain amount of error within a 
crawler’s estimated numbers, due to 
the large volume of computers on the 
network. 

“It’s like a street, where at any 
point and time there can be multiple 
cars entering and leaving,” Enright 
said. “It’s like [the game] telephone, 
where you ask a bunch of cars to tell 
me about the car next to them. But, 
by the time it gets back to me, the car 
that one of the other cars mentioned 
might not be there anymore.” 

After learning of Enright’s list 
of infected computers that Enright 
found with his crawler, Savage invited 
the student to work with his team of 
researchers. 

“The [infected computers] need 
some way of communicating back to 
[the bot master], so we try to under-
stand how the command control 
works,” Savage said. “That way, we can 
monitor what the botnets are being 

told to do — what they are saying 
they have done.” 

The team has now switched its 
main focus toward the economics of 
cybercrime, putting an emphasis on 
spam e-mails. 

“We were able to confuse about 
1 percent of the botnets,” Savage 
said. “So, 1 percent of botnets were 
confused into sending an e-mail with 
a Web link which pointed to [Web 
sites] that we control. We were able 
to answer the question no one has 
answered before: How many people 
get the mail, click on the link and then 
go to the site and buy?” 

The team monitored the Storm bot-
net in computers they purposely infect-
ed for about 20 days last year. Within 
that time period, they estimated that 
a spammer selling generic drugs for a 
hired pharmacy could make approxi-
mately $3 million to $4 million a year 
through spam e-mails alone.

By gaining more specific knowl-
edge of spammer profits, Savage hopes 
to understand the cost benefits behind 
cybercrime and find ways to combat 
it. Understanding these business 
models, he says, will make it easier 
to fight cybercrime from an insider’s 
perspective. 

“We’re trying to understand things 
from the criminal’s point of view,” 
Savage said. “It’s hard to decide the 
right way to combat something if you 
don’t know the weaknesses, like the 

bottlenecks in [spammer profits] and 
what effects them.” 

Although Savage is focusing pri-
marily on cybercrime economics, he’s 
found some techniques to infiltrate 
botnets along the way. 

“One of the interests in the 
Department of Defense is the strate-
gic threat,” Savage said. “They would 
like to find a way that, if they were 
infected with a botnet, they can infil-
trate it and shut it off, or see what 
information it could have taken. So 
we can try to build tools and automate 
the shutdown process, and test it in a 
way that’s safe.” 

However, Savage insists that UCSD 
will never go so far as to take the war 
on cybercrime completely into its own 
hands. 

“We will never be an operational 
organization that will shut off bot-
nets,” Savage said. “There’s a whole 
bunch of legal issues with that. What 
we’re working on is the technology to 
infiltrate and, if duly authorized, to 
shut down.” 

Ultimately, Savage said his team 
hopes to work toward the prevention 
of organized crime networks of the 
future.

“[Spam and cybercrime] are defi-
nitely profitable,” Enright said. “It’s 
basically your 21st century mafia.”

The Triton men saw less success 

at the meet, racking up a total of 
119 points — only one point above 
fourth-place Cal State Stanislaus. 

The top three Triton finishers 
crossed the line within 15 seconds of 
each other. Senior Mike Wright was 
the first to finish, in 26:22 — good 
for 22nd place in the 8K race. He was 
followed by sophomores Jeremy Riley 
and John Svet, who finished 23rd and 
24th, respectively. 

“Humboldt got in front of us early, 
and ended up getting in their top 
seven before our top five,” Baum said. 
“At regionals, we’ll look to reign in 
Stanislaus, and we’ll have our eye on 
Humboldt.”

First-place Chico State was led by 

conference champion Jimmy Elam, 
and won their eighth consecutive 
CCAA Championships. The Wildcats 
fielded five of the first seven finishers,  
and are ranked No. 3 nationally in 
Division II.

“It’s always tough when you lose a 
race by just a point,” Garcia said. “But 
I feel confident that with a good effort 
and a little bit better day, they can 
turn in better results at the regional 
meet.”

The Tritons’ next race will be 
for the NCAA Division II West 
Regionals, held at the home course 
of San Francisco State University on 
Nov. 7.

Irvine came into the contest having 
won six straight games, including an 
Oct. 11 victory against UCSD. 

The Tritons came out strong, 
holding the Anteaters to one goal in 
the first half and scoring three in the 
second period to lead 4-1 at halftime.

However, UC Irvine entered the 
second half with renewed strength, 
jumping on UCSD for two scores in 
the first three minutes and cutting 
the Tritons’ lead to one goal. 

Madsen got the Tritons back on 
track momentarily — converting 
on a six-on-five opportunity with 
just under five minutes left in the 
third quarter but the Anteaters took 
advantage of Triton defensive mis-
cues. The opposing team closed out 
the period with two man-up goals, 
evening the score heading into the 
final period.

“During the first half, we had 
really strong intensity on defense and 
on the counterattack,” Roberts said. 
“We came out with same intensity 
in the second half, but we weren’t as 
consistent.”

Junior driver Sean Cruz regained 
the lead with a six-on-five conver-

sion two minutes in. UC Irvine’s 
Tom Kruip tied it up with a goal 
one minute later, and the Anteaters 
scored again with 2:28 left in regula-
tion, claiming their first advantage of 
the game. The Tritons were unable 
to fight back to tie the game, falling 
to the Anteaters by one goal for the 
second time this season. 

“Overall, we showed good effort 
in the game,” Roberts said. “We knew 
going into it that this was going to 
be a physical game, and we brought 
physicality to it. They just made one 
more goal than we did.”

UCSD now prepares for a faceoff 
at Cal State Long Beach on Oct. 30 
at 7 p.m. and an away match against 
WWPA rival Loyola Marymount 
University on Oct. 31 at 12 p.m. 

The Tritons look to reverse a 
recent string of losses to the No. 1 
Lions, including three defeats to the 
team earlier this season. 

“We want to show them that we 
belong in the top 10,” Roberts said. 
“We know we have to have no mental 
mistakes against these teams.”

coach Brian McManus said. “But I 
don’t think [sophomore goal keeper] 
Kristin [Armstrong] was ever both-
ered. There was never a hard save 
to make.”

UCSD’s defense played effi-
ciently, disrupting the aggressive Cal 
State San Bernardino offense. Of 12 
Coyote shots, only two required a 
save. Armstrong’s two saves — one 
in the first period and one in the 
second period — helped maintain the 
Tritons’ one-goal lead.

winning goal — added a team save in 
the second period, when she deflect-
ed a Coyote corner kick heading dan-
gerously close to the UCSD net.

“Not one of their better games,” 
McManus said. “But lot of teams 
would have folded under the pres-
sure, and they stood up to it well.”

After defeating the Coyotes, the 
Tritons aimed their sights on the Cal 
Poly Pomona Broncos.

Freshman defender Haley 
Johnson netted her second goal of the 
season in the game’s 13th minute, and 
UCSD’s defense held strong en route 
to the 1-0 final score. Armstrong’s 
second shutout in as many games 
gave the Triton’s their ninth win out 
of their most recent ten games.

The victory assures the Tritons a 
spot in the CCAA Championships  
— which will give the team some 
breathing room over the final two 
games of the regular season. 

“The pressure is starting to get to 
the younger players now,” McManus 
said. “We have to try to get that out 
of their heads and just get them con-
centrated to play one game at a time.”

The Tritons’ next game is at home 
on Friday, Oct. 30 against Cal State 
Los Angeles, who currently sits one 
place behind UCSD in conference 
standings.

son starts next week, the game itself 
was pretty irrelevant; what made 
the night incredible was watching 
and listening to the players up close. 
No matter how many megapixels 
your HDTV has, nothing compares 
to hearing players curse a bad call, 
downstream of the sweat and smells 
wafting from the bench.

In the second quarter, both 
benches emptied when the Lakers’ 
Lamar Odom got in a shoving match 
with the Nuggets’ Kenyon Martin, 
giving me a firsthand look at the 
emotion and machismo of profes-
sional basketball in its rawest form. 
Overhearing Birdman Andersen — a 
recovering drug addict — from three 
feet away, yelling about the scuffle, is 
about as close to being a part of the 
game as you can get without cover-
ing your body in tattoos and grow-
ing seven inches. 

The incident also allowed me to 
see Denver’s star player, Carmelo 
Anthony, acting like a reformed 
goofball. Anthony — who served a 
15-game suspension in 2006 for an on 
court fight with the New York Knicks 
— stayed on the bench as his team-
mates streamed out onto the court. 
Very aware of his reputation Melo 
laid down, winding his arms and legs 
through five chairs in a makeshift 
straightjacket. Smirking from ear to 
ear, the Nuggets’ perennial all-star 
jokingly repeated “Hold me back; 
Hold me back.” 

Scenes like that are never impor-
tant enough to be covered by major 
media networks, but it was those 
types of pro-sport subtlety that was so 
refreshing to see up close. 

The game lacked the star power 
of a normal match — Kobe Bryant 
and most of the starters played only 
in the first quarter of the preseason 
match — but the true magic of my  
journalistic experience was waiting in 
the postgame interviews.

After hearing from both head 

coaches in the tunnel, I joined the 
swarming mass of reporters as we 
slithered into the Lakers locker room. 
Even the decrepit state of the San 
Diego Sports Arena and its pathetic 
facilities couldn’t sully the fact that 
I was about to go behind the scenes 
and speak in person with some of the 

world’s biggest 
sports stars. 

I didn’t 
really know 
what to expect 
from such 
a privileged 
vantage point 
into the lives 
of pro athletes. 
I wasn’t sure 
if I would 
feel awkward 
for  intruding 
on their per-
sonal space. 
Imagine being 
forced to talk 
to a room of  
strangers the 
moment you 
step out of 
the shower.  
There wasn’t 
really a sense 
of pressure or 

anxiety after the preseason game, but 
I wondered how intrusive it would be 
to approach athletes after an impor-
tant game. 

Admittedly, I was pretty nervous 
when I walked into the room where 
the Lakers were icing up and chang-
ing into their street clothes. I wanted 
to make sure I looked professional 
and scored quick interviews instead 
of awkwardly standing around while 
naked millionaires got dressed. 

I walked in, saw Derrick Fisher 
sitting down and threw my digital 
recorder in his face, blurting out 
a question about the game. Fisher 
stared at me for the longest two sec-
onds of my life, motioned down with 

his eyes and said, “Normally, I at least 
have my pants on.” 

Apparently, you’re not supposed 
to prod players for interviews while 
they’re only wearing a towel. Lesson 
learned. 

A little embarrassed, I walked 
over to the corner where Kobe was 
addressing a group of reporters. I 
was more than happy just to stick my 
microphone in with the sea of waving 
microphones and observe the delicate 
tango between player and journalist. 
I was surprised at how approachable 
Kobe and his Lakers teammates where 
— and none seemed bothered to talk 
with a college kid trying his hardest to 
look nonchalant. 

No matter how comfortable I felt 
around my new friends, I still didn’t 
dare talk to Artest, the Lakers’ new 
hitman, whose face is permanently 
frozen in a prison mug shot. 

Hulking in the corner was DJ 
Mbenga, the Lakers’ backup center. 
Standing at a modest seven feet and 
weighing a humble 255 pounds, 
Mbenga was quite a sight in the 
cramped Sports Arena locker room. 
Born in the Democratic Republic of 
Congo but raised in Belgium, Mbenga 
speaks  very limited English, and 
thereby didn’t have a single reporter 
asking him about his evening’s solid 
performance — 14 points — while 
spelling the injured Pao Gasol and 
Andrew Bynam.

Mbenga looked hesitantly at me 
as I walked toward him — assum-
ingly unenthused about having to do 
another interview in English. Despite 
his initial surprise at my speaking 
in French, Mbenga opened up and 
eagerly talked with me about how 
happy he was getting so much playing 
time and how prepared he was for it.

When I eventually left the Lakers’ 
clubhouse and walked out of the 
stadium, I felt a calm sense of accom-
plishment. For one night, I had been 
a professional journalist, and — aside 
from briefly annoying a near-naked

point guard — I did a good job. I 
held up the appearance of a seasoned 
sports writer and got a great sense for 
a profession that — if it weren’t for the 
impending death of print media — I 
would love to pursue for a living. 

Along with picking up solid tips 
on how to be a pro journalist from 
other writers, I also absorbed a lot 
of random facts that the average fan 
would never pick up on from simply 
watching a televised game. Chief 
among these tidbits is Denver head 
coach George Karl’s left pinky finger, 
which bends straight out to the side 
at the joint and Lakers forward Adam 
Morrison’s mustache, which somehow 
looks even more slimy in person. 

Ah, the perks of behind-the-scenes 
access.

Seeing as basketball isn’t my 
No. 1 favorite sport — baseball gets 
that honor — the Lakers game was 

the perfect place for me to earn my 
journalistic chops. Sure, I was excited 
about mingling with basketball stars 
all night, but I was never so giddy that 
I was a fan rather than a writer. 

While sitting courtside, I couldn’t 
help but think about how great it 
would be to do this professionally. 
Following teams, interviewing play-
ers and writing articles seems like the 
greatest job possible. 

However, the challenges of 
becoming a journalist were evident 
all around me — most of the other 
writers at the table were middle-aged, 
speaking volumes about how difficult 
it is for a writer to get started. 

Despite my love for sports and a 
whole lot of ambition, I most likely 
will never become a journalist — 
and I’m OK with that, because for 
one night in San Diego, I was. And it 
was incredible. 

Even the 
decrepit state 
of the San 
Diego Sports 
Arena and its
pathetic 
facilities 
couldn’t sully 
the fact that I 
was about to 
go behind the 
scenes and 
speak in 
person with 
some of the 
world’s biggest 
sports stars.

into the match with renewed ener-
gy, but senior outside hitter Sylvia 
Schmidt pulled UCSD to the finish 
with impressive hitting and pinpoint 
serving. The Tritons ended the first 
set with a 25-23 first-set victory after 
a missed serve by the Golden Eagles 
clinched the win.

“It was a physical game,” senior 
captain outside hitter Karen Reis 
said. “We played well, but it could 
have gone either way.”

In the second set, the two teams 
battled head to head, flexing their 
offensive muscles and consistently 
swapping points and lead chang-
es. Sophomore outside hitter Katie 
Condon’s serves helped the Tritons 
scratch out a marginal advantage. As 
the Golden Eagles battled back, both 
squads got a little rowdy. 

Outbursts from the Triton bench 
earned the team a yellow card. Rather 
than playing down to their penalty, 
though UCSD came back firing to 
regain a small lead. The set remained 
up for grabs until Williamson’s kill 
clinched a 27-25 victory.

“All of the games were two-point 

games,” head coach Tom Black said. 
“There was no margin of error. 
When you’re playing a team at the 
top of their game, it’s a hard game.”

As in the first two sets, neither 
team was able to take control in the 
third, and remained within three 
points of one another. 

Though the Tritons played tough, 
the Golden Eagles took a small lead 
late in the set that forced the Tritons 
to play catch-up. 

The Tritons pulled to within 
23-24, but a UCSD net violation 
at game point handed the Golden 
Eagles their first set win of the night.

“They’re a good team,” Black said. 
“We just didn’t transition as well as I 
thought we usually do.”

Building off momentum from 
their previous win, Cal State Los 
Angeles jumped to a quick advan-
tage in the fourth set. The Tritons 
never allowed the Golden Eagles to 
hang around, claiming an easy 25-11 
set to earn their 13th consecutive 
victory. 

“We really just put pressure on 
them in the fourth set,” Reis said.

The night before their match with 

Cal State Los Angeles, the Tritons 
improved their all-time record 
against Cal State Dominguez Hills 
to 39-1 with a three-set sweep of the 
Toros. In the first set, the Tritons 
stormed to an early lead, taking 11 of 
the first 15 points of the match and 
leading by as much as 10. 

The onslaught proved too much 
for the Toros to handle, and UCSD 
took a 25-15 win in the first set.

In the second set, the Tritons kept 
their momentum up, scoring the first 
five points before the Toros could 
pull within 9-7. However, as Cal 
State Dominguez Hills edged closer, 
Williamson went on a kill streak to 
nail three consecutive points for the 
Tritons, reclaiming a definitive hold 
on the match. 

UCSD extended its lead through-
out the set, and Williamson eventu-
ally put down the game-winning kill 
to end the set 25-20.

In the match’s third and final set, 
the Tritons faltered early but pulled 
together in flawless play to take the 
score to 12-5 — a lead that would 
stick as UCSD cruised to an easy 
25-13 sweep.

The Tritons nailed both games 
despite an unusual travel sched-
ule that included a game at Cal 
State Dominguez Hills on Thursday 
before heading back to San Diego 
to host the Golden Eagles on Friday 
night. 

“I was a little worried about the 
travel schedule,” Black said. “But it 

was great to come out so fast and get 
the win so quickly.”

UCSD will travel north next 
weekend to face Cal State Stanislaus 
on Oct. 30 and Chico State on Oct. 
31.

WATER POLO — The No. 11 Tritons 
suffered a disappointing second-half 
loss against No. 7 UC Irvine on Oct. 
23, narrowly missing a three-game 
sweep and forcing UCSD to settle for 
a 2-1 weekend. 

The Anteaters scored four goals in 
the third quarter to erase the Tritons’ 
commanding halftime lead, handing 
the team a tough 7-6 loss. UCSD 
recovered the next day, executing a 
quick turnaround in its Oct. 24 dou-
bleheader by posting conference vic-

tories over Claremont-Mudd-Scripps 
and Pomona-Pitzer in Claremont. 
The Tritons’ record now stands at 
11-11.

The road trip continues this week-
end, when UCSD will face off against 
Loyola Marymount University and 
Cal State Long Beach. Both teams 
have dealt the Tritons harsh defeats 
this season.

The Tritons ended the weekend on 
a high note, defeating Pomona-Pitzer 
10-6. Junior driver Bryce Madsen, 
junior driver Ryan Allred and senior 
driver Sean Roberts scored two goals 
apiece, and sophomore goalkeeper 

David Morton blocked 12 Pomona-
Pitzer shot attempts. 

Allred has been on an offensive 
roll ever since he scored his first six 
goals of the season against Chapman 
University on Oct. 9. The transfer 
student now has 20 scores on the 
season.

“Ryan is a great player with one 
of the quickest shots I’ve ever seen,” 
Roberts said. “We knew that — com-
ing from a [junior college] — Ryan 
was going to have to step up and 
play intense on defense and offense. 
Overall, he’s a very sound player, and 
his quickness is probably his best 

attribute.”
Coming off their loss to UC 

Irvine, the Tritons faced CMS for the 
first time this year. The last time the 
two teams met at the 2008 Western 
Water Polo Association Tournament, 
UCSD demolished CMS 24-8. This 
time around, UCSD wasn’t able to 
run up the score quite as high, but 
still came away with an 11-8 win. 

The Tritons jumped ahead to a 
4-1 lead after the first period, extend-
ing their lead to 7-2 at halftime. They 
stayed strong in the third period for 
three goals and a 10-4 advantage 
going into the fourth quarter. 

Senior two-meter defender Steven 
Donohoe led UCSD with three goals, 
while Madsen and senior two-meter 
defender Peter Gresham netted two 
scores. Four other Tritons got on the 
board with one goal each.

“We wanted to bring the same 
intensity that we brought against 
Irvine, and we knew Claremont 
wouldn’t be able to handle counterat-
tack and our press,” Roberts said. “In 
the end, it paid off.”

Friday night, the Tritons faced 
a streaking Anteater squad — UC

HOTCORNERAROUND THE LEAGUE
With a 5-2 victory over the Los 
Angeles Angels in game 6 of the AL 
Championship Series on Oct. 25 the New 
York Yankees earned a trip to the World 
Series — the Bronx Bombers’ first Series 
appearance since the 2003 season.

For their annual preseason game at the San Diego Sports Arena, the Los Angeles Lakers were nice enough to grant me full media access to an Oct. 
23 match against the Denver Nuggets. For one 
night, I was a professional sports journalist. 

The experience was overwhelming — so 
much that I spent my first hour experiencing 
bipolar facial disorder. I would break out in an 
enormous, goofy grin at the thought of being 
courtside at a Lakers game, then immediately 
go expressionless as I tried to look profes-
sional and fit in. 

After finding our seats at the media table 
directly behind the Nuggets bench, my pho-
tographer and I headed to the ESPN hospi-

tality room to grub on the complimentary 
buffet. I almost threw up my free meal when 
— walking through the tunnel to the court— I 
crossed paths with current Lakers assistant 
coach and NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 
I nodded, and he nodded back. I felt cool. 

As opening tip-off approached, the experi-
ence intensified. Players from both teams were 

now on the court for warm-ups, and here I 
was, shooting the breeze with other writers as 
fans filled the stands. 

As the start of the game approached, I set-
tled into my spot at the media table — a writer 
from ESPN.com on my left and one from the 
German Press Agency (random) on my right. 
I was so close behind the Denver bench that I 
could have easily reached out and touched any 
of the hulking players — which I eventually 
did, when Chris “Birdman” Andersen offered 
me an epic fist bump after our brief conversa-
tion in the third quarter.

CROSS COUNTRY — Traveling 
nearly the entire California coast to 
race in a pressure-filled conference 
championship against the nation’s 
top Division-II squads last Saturday, 
UCSD prepared for a tough competi-
tion. 

Two strong races later, those chal-
lenges didn’t prove to be much of a 
problem.

The UCSD cross-country team 
competed in the 2009 California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Champions Oct. 24 at Humboldt 
State University in Arcata, Calif. 

The Triton women took their best 
finish in years — second place over-
all — while the men’s team came in 
fifth place.

The women’s impressive per-
formance follows three consecutive 

third-place seasons at conference 
championships, and marks one of the 
best performances the Tritons have 
seen as member of the CCAA. 

The effort was not enough to 
break a dominating Chico State, how-
ever, who claimed their second con-
secutive conference title — and their 
sixth in eight years. The Wildcats are 
currently ranked No. 1 nationally in 
Division II.

The women were led by junior Bre 
Schofield’s second-place finish. After 
completing the 6K course in 22:13, 
she was awarded with her second 
straight all-CCAA recognition. 

However, Schofield was far from 
alone in delivering strong perfor-
mance — it took solid running from 
the entire team to hold off rival Cal 
Poly Pomona by only seven points. 

Senior Marie Schaper finished 
18th on the day with a time of 23:44, 
while sophomore Elena Inouye 
came in less than one second behind 
her to take 19th place. Sophomore 
Aaryn Kobayashi and junior Caprice 
Thompson took 24th and 32nd 
respectively, rounding out UCSD’s 
score. 

Their collaborative effort worked 

to the team’s advantage:  all seven 
Tritons were able to finish before Cal 
Poly’s fifth runner crossed the line.

“We were really pleased with 
what the women accomplished,” head 
coach Nate Garcia said. “They came 
up here with a clear focus on what 
they wanted to accomplish, and we 
were happy to see them able [to] real-

ize that.”
Cal State Los Angeles senior 

Vivien Wadeck was the overall wom-
en’s winner for the second straight 
year, becoming only the second 
repeat champion in the history of the 
women’s CCAA Championships.

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — UCSD 
notched two more wins last week, 
maintaining its spot atop conference 
standings and solidifying its No. 2 
national ranking. 

In their weekend opener on Oct. 
22, the Tritons defeated Cal State 
Dominguez Hills in three sets before 
beating No. 22 Cal State Los Angeles 
in four sets the following night — a 
match that saw sophomore outside 
hitter Hillary Williamson rack up a 
team-leading 15 kills and a .444 hit-
ting clip. 

The wins improved UCSD’s 
record to 22-1 (14-1 in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association). 

In their first set against Cal State 
Los Angeles, the Tritons played 
neck-to-neck with the Golden Eagles 
throughout the night, neither team 
able to pull away. 

Both teams displayed solid 
offense, but effective net play allowed 
the Tritons to grab an 11-6 lead in the 
first set, forcing a CSULA timeout.

WOMEN’S SOCCER — Bouncing 
back after losing an important con-
ference game last week, the No. 11 
UCSD women’s soccer team snuck 
past California Collegiate Athletic 
Association rival Cal State San 
Bernardino 1-0 on Oct. 23 at Triton 
Field. 

The women followed up with 
another 1-0 victory two days later 
against Cal Poly Pomona. The vic-
tories improve the Triton record to 
an impressive 14-3 (11-3 CCAA), 
giving them sole possession of first 
place in the CCAA South Division.

UCSD got out to an early 1-0 
advantage against Cal State San 
Bernardino and never looked back. 
The Tritons took command of the 
match in the seventh minute, when 
junior midfielder Lisa Bradley 
deflected a corner kick and headed 
it past the Cal State San Bernardino 
keeper. Bradley’s first goal of the 
year makes her the 13th player on 
the squad to score a goal this season.

Unlike the Coyote offense — 
which shot aggressively to overcome 
UCSD’s one-goal advantage — the 
Triton offense was selective with 
its shots. San Bernardino outshot 
UCSD 12-3 in the game.

“Yes they had a lot of shots,” head
