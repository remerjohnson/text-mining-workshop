W oo't Cut Academic 
but $1200 Tuition Seen 

The budget will not be broken 
down by campuses, but will serve as a 
guideline to how much the university 
will suffer from the Jarvis initiative, 
and will be "an iffy thing," McElroy 
said. 

One of the first measUres that will 
be taken if the proposition is passed is 
'an immediate implementation of 
tuition, possibly $1,200 yearly, 
according to McElroy. 

McElroy also suggested other, 
non·academic areas in which cuts 
could occur: 

- Reduce the Instruction and 
Research budget by five percent, a 
savings of "close to $20 miDion." 

- Reduce or eliminate buildinga 
and grounds upkeep for a poaaible 
savings of $10 million. 

- Cut the budget of agricultural 
extension in half for another $10 
million savings. 

Chancellor McElroy say •• ltudent fee hike of $ 1,200 is likely if the Jarvi. 2 
income tax-cuttint initiative paNel in June. 

This tuition would account for 
about half of the funds needed to 
offset the losses from Jarvis II, and if 
the initiative passes "under present 
economic conditions, I don't think 
there would be any choice" but to 
implement it, McElroy commented. 

McElroy expects enrollment to 
decline by about 10 percent if tuition 
is imposed. The tuition, which would 
be in addition to current student fees, 
would begin fall quarter, according to 
McElroy. 

In addition, McfJroy auggested 
that pay increases would be 
eliminated for university employees, 
and that temporary faculty positions 
might not be refilled. 'lhere are 
currentlr 50 "iemporane." employed 
at UCSD who, if not rehired, "would 
probably be more than enough to 
take care of any faculty cut we might 
have to go through," he said. 

!II Kathy Huffer 
Managing Editor 

McfJroy spoke in response to 
recent "rumors" that liberal arts 
departments and programs might be 
eliminated at UCSD under Jarvis II. 

While the passage of "Jarvis II" 
would probably result in an 
implementation of tuition next fall and 
widespread cutbacks at UCSD, there 
;s no chance that academic 
departments or programs will be 
eliminated, Chancellor William 
McElroy declared Friday. 

"If Jarvis II passes, we're going to 
do everything to proteCt the arts and 
science campus,' he said. "There's 
no intent to close any programs." 

McElroy was reluctant to discuss 
possible areas of cuts that would be 
neces.ary if the tax initiative passes in 
June, until UC President David 
Saxon submits a contingency budget 
later this week. 

Tuition may also be implemented 
at UCSD's medical school, up to 
$5,000 annually, McElroy said. 
"That would get you almost $70 
million right there," he commented. 

McElroy also said Jarvis II would 
mean, "We'd stop watering the 
grounds, we would not mow the 
grass, we wouldn't empty 
wastebaskets but maybe once a 
month, we'd probably have to close 
down the university on Saturday. and 
Sunday .... things like that - real 
drastic." Labeling academics "the heart of 

the university," McfJroy said they 
will receive the highest priority for 
protection againxt the tax initiative. 

Flaw Exposed In Vision 
'Correction by Pilots May 
Be Dangerous, UCSD Says 

From the Aasociated Press 
A controver.ial procedure that temporarily improves vision, 

allowing airline pilots to pass required eye exams, has serious 
Haw. and is potentially dangeroua, a UCSD study shows. 

In a 48-page report that took 40 months of .tudy, Associate 
Professor of Opthamology Dr. Perry S. Binder contends results of 
the treatment are unp~icatble and uncontrollable. 

But the Federal Aviation Administration say. it i. powerless to 
stop the practice - known as orthokeratology - which was 
developed in San Diego more than 20 years ago. 

Pioneer. of the procedure, Dr. Charles H. May of San Diego 
and Dr. Stuart C. Grant of Beverly Hal., believed eyesight could 
be improved by gradually flattening the curve of the cornea with a 
series of hard contact lenses. 

In theory, the patient progresses to the point where he or .he is 
able to wear a retainer lena without prescription for part of each 
dar and then, finally, no lentea at all. 

Binder, also chief of ophthalomology at the San Diego 
Veteran. Admini.tration Hospital, was commissioned to do the 
study by May and Grant. 

Using 20 patients selected by the two, Binder found that even 
when the vision in:lproves, the patient .till cannot see a • .well as 
with g1as.es or contacts. 

He said the cornea, the transparent curved exterior part of the 
eye that heI.,. to focus lights, tends to return to its original .hape 
once the corrective len. i. removed. 

May has said airline pilots make good patients because they are 
rnoIiv~ed enough to undergo the expensive, two-year treatment. 

. It costa about $2,000. 
The FAA permit. airline pilots to have corrected - either with 

spectacl. or contacts - 20-20 vision. 
However. an FAA flight surgeOn told the San Diello U:1ion 

there are' 10 many more applicants for airline pilot job. that the 
major airlines give high priority to uncorrected eyes.

Brown Gets Cut of Tidelands 
Money Front Education Fund 
Second $150 Million Goes to State Energy Plan 

ByCaro~day 
Sacramento pondent 

After a month of haggling, Governor 
Brown's office and the three segments of public , 
higher education have finally agreed on a plan 
to divvy up an estimated $455 million in profits 
for 1980·81 from the state-owned tidelands oil 
revenue. 

Senator Albert Rodda, D-Sacramento, 
chairman of the powerful Senate Finance 
Committee, will introduce legislation today to 
modify the statute that has awarded all the 
tidelands profits to COFPHE, the Capitol 
Outlay Fund for Public Higher Education, and 
divert some of the monies to finance Brown's 
cut energy projects. 

La.t year UC used this fund to begin 
construction of the Drew·UCLA Medical 
Center, and to make the Sacramento Medical 
Center, connected with the UC Davis Medical 
School, safe in earthquake •. University plans 
for 1980·81 call for the fund to buyout the San 

D~o County hospital. 
The Rodda bill will ~i.tribute the profits in a 

watershed type structure with three funds 
receiving the money. 

The fir.t $150 million profit after fixed 
expenses will go into the COFPHE fund, the 
remainder wiD go into the newly created energy 
and resources fuhd. 

A. Brown's energy task force chairman 
Gray Davis agreed to cap off the energy and 
resources fund at $150 million, the residual 
profit will go into a general fund to which state 
agencies would have access for public 
construction projects. 

Lowell Page, special assistant to UC 
President David Saxon, repre.ented the UC in 
the negotiation •. Saxon .ay. he is plea.ed with 
the proposed bill because it will lJUarantee a 
$150 miUion plu. the co.t .of construction 
index, and will be annually at the disposal of the 
three segments of public and higher education. 

"We're tired of being sitting ducks and 
fighting off all those biJls that want to raise the 
fund. Of course this bill doesn't remove those 
risks but does diminish them," he said. 

Two years ago the State Lands Commission 
predicted the tidelands oil would be dried up by 
1982, but with the Mideast crisis and 
congres.ional decontrol of heavy crude oil the 
California oil has now skyrocketed $6 a barrel 
to $25 a barrel. 

At the January Regents' meeting in San 
Francisco Lt. Gov. Mike Cutb quoted federal 
government predictions that the revenue from 
the tidelands oil properties from Santa Barbara 
to south of Long Beach would amount to $22 
billion in the next decade (state·owned lands 
that produce private companies). Curb implied 
that tidelands revenues could be very useful in 
offsetting the effect of Jarvis II (he came out for 
Jarvis II.) 

Senator Rodda, who refused to author the bill 
until it represented a consensus between the 
government and higher education, does not feel 
the bill will run into any trouble, according to 
Senate Finance Committee Consultant Greg 
Geeting. 

If Jarvis II passes, however, Page says that 
all bets for the Rodda bill are off, although he 
doubts Rodda wiD permit a disclaimer that 
would automatically invalidate the legislation 
should the taxcutting initiative pa •• since it does 
not involve a new program.

Also, when UCSD had the

that was making obnoxious,

any of the UCSD players or 

coac~s' what they thought of 
this display 01 "spirit," I am 
sure that they would tell you, 
to put it quite mildly, that the

Another thing I would like 
to discuss is the throwing 01

I'm not saying that Third

Referring back to the official

to have a break from this routine - most nights at six Sharon 
sat in the center of the living room in a lotus position she 
learned from a Life magazine photo (a nude man painfully 
crOll-legged under a Ram Dall portrait) and would rub her

"Fuck it, then." He turned away from her and snapped on 
the TV. Walter Cronkite was reading the news. On the de.k 
was a lign reading THIS IS IT. 

"The federal government, exerci.ing liltle known laws

McElroy: Jarvis Won't Cut Classes 
ConIinued from po;,e J 
lP'ants and contracta/ adminis· 
tr.tion and the purchasm, 
department, McElroy said. 

Only after cuQ in thet . 
areas have been made would 
academic cuta be considered, 
McfJroy said. 

"Communications , for 
example - that', a popular 
program and I think we 'd try to 
protect it." Such programs, he 
added, would be safe because 
their faculty are hired through 
departments . 

The bill darifies Jarvis II 
language by applying the 
initiative to fiscal year 1981. 
which begins in June. The tax 
initiative currently does not 
specify whether tax cuts are to 
be made beginning in JWle or 
are to be retroactive to 
January, 1980. 

"We may have to cut an 
FTE (FuB Time Employee) 
here and there from various 
departments, but that deci.ion 
hasn't been made yet," he 
aaid. 

ButuntilSaxoncanre~nd 
to Governor Brown ' , 
contingency budget, to be 
presented March 15, McElroy 
said he cannot make plans for 
cutbacks. 

If the bill, which Jarvis 
backs, i. passed, the state of 
California wiU cut its budget by 
$3.5 billion instead of $5 
bimon, reducing the impact 
upon the UC .ystem, McElroy 
said. 

Academic program. 
without department status "we 
woukllry to pi ~tect the same 
way we do the departments," 
McFJroyemphasized. 

UCSD and the other UC 
campuses could be spared part 
of the impacts of Jarvis 11 if a 
bill proposed by state legislator 
William Campbell (R·Los 
Angeles) is passed, McElroy 
noted. 

Despite the overwhelming 
approval of Proposition 13, 
McElroy believes that "if we 
work hard enough at it, we 

Teliing Facts of Life to Parents 
A million teenager, a year get pregnant, one 

in every 10 girJs between 13 and 18. And half 
of America', adolescents are. eexually active. 

Those are accepted statistics, says Cynthia 
D. Martin, a La Jolla psycholotPsl who has 
raearched teenage sexuality and pregnancy, 
and who for a number of years has counseled 
both adolescents and adultl. 

Afler all, Martin S.YI, sex il being sold, 
pushed and praised everywhere the young 
person tuml today. The result seems to be 
increasing numbers of adolescent pregnancies 
and .bortionl, an epidemic of VD, artd large 
number. of sexualy confused young people. 

Add to that confused parents wllo are 
uncertain how to cope with !he new sexual 
altitude. _mung the young, Martin says. She 

adds that parenti can no longer afford to tum 
their heads away and say, in effect, "my child is 
obviously not having sex with anyone." 

Martin i, presenting a weekend program for 
the public Friday evening, Feb. 22 and all-day 
Saturday, Feb. 23 titled liThe Sexually Active 
Adolescent." Sponsored by UCSD Extension, 
the program is open to parents and helping

The dass is scheduled f~r 7-10 pm Feb. 22

might be able to defeat" Jarvis 
II. 

"We already have a 
credibility gap on (Prop.) 13," 
because warnings that the first 
initiative would have severe 
impacts on the UC system 
were overstated, McElroy 
said. 

"The problem is, we haven't 
had the effects of Jarvis I yet 
because of the (state budget's) 
surplus," McElroy said. "That 
will be coming at the end of 
next year - the real impact. " 

In the meantime, McElroy 
said he will wait for Saxon's 

contingency budget plans . 

"Once I get the facts, then 
we ' ll· get together with 
.tudents, the faculty and the 
staff, " to form a committee to 
actively oppose the initiative, 
he said. 

''I'll meet with the Board of 
Overseers, the Chamber of 
Commerce, the Kiwanis and 
Rotarians, and any other 
organizations we can get our 
hands on," McElroy added . 

M c Elroy said he will 
probably not begin his 
campaign until April. 

Technique For,Shaping 
Pilots' Corneas Risky 
Continued from poge 1 

Pilot-patients, uti~zing the orthokeratology technique, use a 
retainer lens the night before an eye exam and by the time their 
eyes are tested , their vision may reach the 20-20 level so they can 
get a pilot's certificate unblemished by corrective lenses. . 

Then they go back to wearing retainer lenses . 
"The airline pilot with uncorrected vision reported to be 20·20 

may not be 20-20 when his lens falls out as he is landing your 
plane," Binder told the Union. 

Dr. John Jordan, deputy chief of the FAA's office of aviation 
medicine, said his office does not encourage orthokeratology "for 
any reason, to pass an exam or whatever. " 

A spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association ' in 
Washington said he has heard no reports of use of the technique 
by air~ne pilots. 

"But if a pilot's vision is so bad he is trying to put something 
over on the FAA, it would be a total degradation of safety, and we 
would be against it," the spokesman said.

Tritons Slant Dunk a Groundhog Day Win 
By Barbara Haas 

Senior Staff Writer 
- The Triton varsity cagers cruised to an easy home 
win over Pomona-Pitzer College Saturday night, 
repeating their early season win over the Sagehens 
by 14 points in the La Jolla Classic . 

Gary Haynes and Dana Bedard both scored 18 
points to help lead the team to a Groundhog's Day 
84-72 victory. Six more weeks of winter· may be in 
store for the rest of the nation, but if the Tritons 
continue winning and make it to the playoffs, San 
Diego may just see six more weeks of Triton 
Basketball. 

UCSD broke the game open from the starti~g tip-
off. They gained possession of the ball and canned 
the first score of the one-sided contest. Pomona 
quickly went down by five, and never approached the 
dominant Tritons until late in the first half. 

UCSD was only liP by two with four minutes 
remaining, but a tight defense shut down the threat, 
allowing only three Sagehen points in the rest of the 
period. . 

An offensive spark gave UCSD 10 more POints to 
lead at the half 38-29. 

The second hal went even better for the T ritonl. 
Three starters from Pomona fouled out early and the 
rest of the team never quite got the hang of playing 
together. The nervous second stringers pitched in to 
bring the turnover total to 25; nine more than UC~D. 

Coach Ron Carter was more than satisfied at the 
final score. Toward the end of the game he put in 
some lesser used players, displaying the faith he had 
in the outcome. 

"They played fine basketball tonight, I am real 
ICMI happy with them," Carter said. 

Forward Gary Haynes, who hat the mahat ICOring Stan Hopper led rebounders with seven and 
average on the UCSD team, lays off a pUs druina contributed 13 points. Sherman Johnson also canned 
Saturday'. win over Pomona-Pitzer. Right, Triton pard 13 points including another spectacular slam dunk. 
Dana Bedard puts up a lay up for two more poinb.' Please lurn 10 9

S\Vim TiDleS IDlpressive 
Individuals Make Nat'ls, But T earn Doesn't Shine 

By Jon Goetz 
Sport. Editor 

When you a.k the men's 
swim coach how many of his 
swimmer. have qualified for 
the national championships 
this year, it takes him a while 
to answer . 

Alter lait weekend the 
number .tands at 10, already 
three more than went in 1979. 
Though the team finished fifth 
of six schools a t the Irvine 
relays Friday and Saturday, 
things are looking good for the 
program. 

UCSD ended up behind Cal 
State Northridge, Pepperdine, 
UC Irvine and San Diego 
State, all school. competing 
within ' the NCAA'. highest 
echelon of swimming. Yet the 
T ritonl, clas.ified in the lowest 
level. of the sport, di.placed 
some of the top relays and 
individual athletes, and gained 
some credence as a feisty, 
small school. 

"It', not very challenging to 
be the be.t of the worst," .aid 
Coach BiD Morgan after the 

meet. "/t's beller to be the 
worst of the besl." 

Competing again.t the best 
added incentives to swim well, 
Chris Dixon, in only hi, second 
meet for UCSD ,ince 
transferring from San Diego 
State, broke school records in 
two events. He led six of his 
teammates in the 100 fly, 
finishing in 50.47. 

The top seven UCSD 
swimmers turned in a quicker 
time than the fas test UCSD 
time last year. 

Dixon and Mark Allen both 
surpassed Allen's old 400 
medley record, but Dixon now 
has poasession of it with his 
4:26.1 clocking, a second· 
and-a·haU ahead of Allen . 

Joe Hernandez turned in a 
typically .pectacular day, 
fini.hing fourth in both the 50 
and 100 free, the highest 
placings for UCSD. His 22.0 
in the 50 also broke his old 
school record by .2 seconds. 
He swam an even fa.ter, yet 
unofficial, time in the last leg of 
the 200 medley relay, with a 

21.8 split time. 

It was a weekend for setting 
national qualifying times, with 
a fast pool and a fast field of 
athletes. Bob Con~n made the 
standard in the 100 
backstroke, and both Lance 
Halsted and Roger Kirton 
qualified for the 1650 free. 
Halsted finished in 17:06.5, 
and Kirton clocked in at 
17:18.4 in his first time 
swimming the event. 

Kevin Lingel, thQugh he 
barely missed national 
qualifying times in a couple of 
events, "had about as good a 
meet as anybody," according 
to Morgan. 

Today in Sports 
The Triton women's 

swim team faces USD in the 
fint of five matches against 
them this month. The meet 
begins at 4 pm at USD.

SD Buds Upset by UCSD's Ultimate Team 
By Scott Allison 

Staff Writer 
Promoting ultimate frisbee 

here has been somewhat of an 
uphill struggle for Scott 
Wilson, captain of UCSD's 
team. 

But Saturday at Revelle 
field his squad accomplished 
what many observers thought 
unlikely: they defeated the 
much more experienced San 
Diego Buds by a score of 17. 
15. 

"Many of our guys have 
been playing ultimate only 14 
w~ks, and yet they played to 
the levd of the Buds , some of 
whom have played more than 
five years," said Wilson. 

Ultimate Frisbee is still in its 
infancy as a sport. Invented in 
New Jersey in 1968, its 
popularity has since spread 
enormously. Now more than 
300 collegiate teams exist in 
the nation. 

The game basically 
combines the elements of 

several other sports: Patterns 
are run as in football, pivot 
foots are used as in basketball 
and the ebb and flow of 
p1aymaking is similar to that 
found in hockey or soccer. 

Despite these fea tures , one 
could argue that Ultimate 
Frisbee 's best quality lies in the 
use of a disc instead of the 

·conventional ball found in 
most other sports. The 
frisbee 's unpredictability and 
limitless use adds a different 
dimension to the game. 

Against the San Diego 
Buds, the Tritons appeared to 
be at a disadvantage in 
experience, size and ability. 

"I guess we just out·smarted 
them," joked Wilson. 

Actual/y , it appeared 
UCSD won because of better 
coaching and preparedness. 
"We went in with a definit~ 
game plan in mind and we 
followed it," Wilson said. 
"Everybody played like a 
team, whereas they (The 
Buds) played like a bunch of 

individuals." 
The Buds were ahead of the 

Tritons at halftime, 10· 7. 
UCSD then reeled off four 
straight points to take the Iea~ 
at the opening of the second 
half. 

• 

1be lead changed hands 
several times during this MH. 

With only three minutes left, 
Brian Walsh made a diving, 
shoe.string catch to give 
UCSD the lead for good, 15· 
14. The victory was the Triton's 

first of 1980. Last quarter the 
Buds embarrassed UCSD with 
a fairly one·sided win over the 
Tritons. But this time many of 
the Triton ultimate frisbee 
newcomers seemed more 
talented and confident.

Basketball 
JV Wins 
In Overtime 

John Wohlmuth and Dave 
Tollner led the JV basketball 
team to a one point overtime 
win over Point Loma Saturday 
night, 76-75. 

Wohlmuth was leading 
scorer with 25, almost one 
third of the Triton total. 
Tol/ner contributed 21 
rebounds and 19 points to help 
put UCSD over the 
competitive Crusader threat. 

The conte.t was tight 
throughout the game. At 
halftime the teams were tied at 
33, and at the end of 
regulation p lay they 
stalemat«:d again at 70.

Carter -Has 
Decided 
On Draft 

WASHINGTON - Preei· 
dent Carter said yesterday he 
has made up his mind on 
whether to ask Congress for 
the authority to require women 
to join men in registering for 
the military draft But he 
declined to say what he had 
decided. 

Carter, as he returned In the 
White House from a weekend 
at the Camp David 
presidential retreat in 
Maryland, was asked whether 
he had reached a decision on 
the controversial subject of 
registering women_ 

"Yes, I've decided," he 
rep~ed , declining to divulge hi. 
decision. 

A White House pre.s 
officer, Jim Purks, was unable 
to provide details_ Aides had 
said previously that a decision 
would be announced by the 
end of this week. 

The president announced 
the re.umption of draft 
registration in his State of the 
Union addrell last month, 
saying it was needed to 
respond to an increaling threat 
from the Soviet Union. But he 
did not say whether he would 
seek to have 'women included 
in the call. 

Stuart Eizenltat, the 
prelident'l chief domeltic 
policy adviser, had said on 
Saturday that the ltaff would 
lend a recommendation to the 
president during the weekend.

Good Humored Collages Recall Bill Cosby 
An exhibit of paintings and 

co8qes by artist Raymond 
Saunders wiD be on display in 
the Mandeville Art Gallery 
from Feb. 15 to March 21. 

Gallery hours are noon to 
Spm Stmday through Friday 
and 7-9pm Wednesday. A 
reception for the artist will be 
held from 5-8pm Friday , Feb. 
15, in the gaJlery. The public is 
welcome to attend. 

Saunders was born in 1934 
in PituIJurAh, Pemsylvania. 

He attended the Pennsylvania 
Academy of Fine Arts and the 
University of Pennsylvania 
and received his bachelor's 
degree from the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology. He 
earned his master of fine arts 
degree at the California 
College of Arts and Crafts and 
currently lives and works in 
Oakland, California. 

Los Angeles Times art critic 
William Wilson compared 
Saunders' works to a Bin 

Cosby monologue, in that tilt! 
works of both men are 
autobiographical and 
fundamentally good-humored. 
Saunders' themes include 
childhood, nostalgia, modern 
society and black culture, 
presented in collages which 
are for the most part playful 
and spontaneous. 

The collages combine 
Saunders' deft and often 
delicate drawings with bold 
brushstrokes of color and

Maybe I am incorrect in my

that most of my own college

" Informants and la~ers

such as "Little Black Sambo" 
and the primary school Dick

was a loud report that echoed up and down the street and 
which got fainter with each re-run as Darrin slowly clutched 
his chest and moved toward the sidewalk. A cop walked over 
the d~ Darrin and looked down at him. 

"Why d ya do it, kid?" he asked. It was only seconds before 
Darrin would be fit for a marble mattress, but he got it in. 

"No blood for a last name," he muttered, then croaking. 
The cop kicked him. Darrin yelled in pain and stood up. 
"What the fuck are you doing, kicking me like that?" 
"You got it wrong," said the cop. "It's supposed to be 'the 

hand i, on the table and it beckons to a ghost. .. ' and so on. 
You know." . 

"Oh," said Darrin, turning back to the house. "Sorry ... I 
forgot. .. " 

"Don't worry about it," rep~ed the cop. "You'll get it right 
next time.'~ Darrin waved at him and walked back into his 
living room, where Sharon was watching Tom Snyder's 
~elebrity clambake.
