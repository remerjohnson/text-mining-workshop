Student Rnds MeAT Error 
MISTAKE: Doc Khaleghi spotted test error; over 20,000 test scores adjusted 
By JEFFREY M. BARKER 
Senior Staff Writer 

An error on the Medical 
College Admissions Test 
(MCAT) taken by prospective 
doctors in August caused the 
test's administrators to adjust 
the scores of over 20,000 stu-
dents. Four of those students 

wrote a letter to MCAT officials, 
bringing the error to their atten-
tion. 

One of those students was 
Revelle senior Doc Khaleghi. 

After taking the exam, 
Khaleghi, a junior, pre-medical 
bio-engineering student, con-
tacted the Association of 
American Medical Colleges, the 

group responSible for the 
MCAT. He said that none of the 
answer options to a multiple-
choice metabolic biochemistry 
question were correct. 

Until receiving a letter of 
thanks from MCAT last week, 
Khaleghi wasn't sure if the

New. Plan 
May Split 
Biology 
DEPARTMENT: 
Proposal was approved 
by the Academic Senate 

JEFFREY M. BARKER 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Academic Senate voted 
to support a proposed reorgani-
zation of the biology depa rt-
ment Tuesday. Chancellor 
Dynes is expected to approve 
the plan. 

Biology professors cited the 
increasingly large number of stu-
dents in the department when 
they proposed splitting biology 
from the division of naturdl sci-
ences . 

The department, in its current 
form, also lacks effective leader-
ship, stated biology department 
Chair Suresh Subramani in a 
written proposa l. 

In the plan, which is awaiting 
Dynes' approva l, biology would 
become its own division with its 
own dean. It would also be split 
into four departments represent-
ing different disciplines within 
the major. Each department 
would have its own chair. 

"Biology is the jewel in the 
crown of UCSD," Subramani 
said. "Help to keep it that way." 

The department's student-to-
teacher ra tio - cu rren tl y 62 to 1 
- compromises teaching and 
research, Subramani stated . In 
1997,28 percent of UCSD under-
graduates were biology majors; 
9 percent of UCSD faculty is in 
the biology department. 
Subramani's proposal also cites 
extreme undergraduate class 
sizes of 350-400 students. 

The proposal also stated that 
the scope of the department 
chair's job is too large for a prac-
ticing scientist. Most chai rs have 
opted to head the department 
only briefly, not wanting to be 
away from their research for too 
long. Subramani agreed to chair 
the department in the future only 
through the reorganization. 

" As soon as this is through, I' ll 
be back in my lab," Subramani 
said .

HUGHES: 
Dynes praised 
professor's work . 

"His intellectual distinction and 
his grasp of the connection 
between scholarship and society 
has helped shape our humanities 
departments as they came of 
age." 
. In 1941, Hughes joined the 
army. Within three rears he was 
promoted to chief 0 the research 
and analysis branch of the Office 
of Strategic Services in the 
Mediterranean Theater. In 1946 
he left the army. 

In 1962, Hughes ran as an 
independent for the U.S. Senate 
against Democrat Ted Kennedy 
and Republican George Lodge. (t 
was then that Hughes earned his 
notoriety in the political arena, 
appearing on television and in a 
1962 column by William F. 
Buckley Jr. 

Because of his prominence 
and his liberal views, tight sur-
veillance was kept on Hughes as 
he traveled through foreign coun-
tries. In 1966, an alert to 
European embassies stated that 
Hughes had previously held 
strong views about communism. 

In the 19605 and '70s Hughes 
chaired "SANE: A Citizen's 
Organization For a Sane World," 
a political organization opposed 
to nuclear weapons. 

Hughes retired from UCSD as 
a professor emeritus in 1986. His 
many achievements - academic 
and political - include ' a 
Guggenheim Fellowship, two 
decorations from the Italian gov-
ernment, membershir in the 
American Academy 0 Arts and 
Sciences and visiting member-
ship to the Institute for 

Advanced Study at Princeton 
University. 

Bernstein said that Hughes 
leaves an important legacy on 
this campus.

A.S. Council's Accusations 
of UCAB are Unfounded 

Last week, the A.S . Council passed a resolution 
condemning the University Centers Advisory Board 
(UCAB) for its duplicitous role in this week's 'uni-
versity centers expansion fee referendum. Yet when 
Lynne Peterson, acting assistant vice chancellor of 
student programs and facilities, conducted an investi-
gation into the matter, she found no wrongdoing. 

The A.S. Council is elected by students to represent 
student interests. While we appreciate the fact that our 
representatives are looking for possible wrongdoing, 
we do not feel that it is appropriate to condemn 
UCAB on the eve of the referendum vote. 

Peterson 's investigation found that UCAB acted in' 
accordance witli campus policies and that an equal 
amount of money was allocated to students advocat-
ing both sides of the issue. 

We believe that it was wrong for council members to 
claim that UCAB neglected its responsibility to present 
both sides of the issue. UCAB has no such responsibil-
ity, and those council members who are opposed to the 
referendum should take up the cause themselves. 

We realize that while A.S. Council members may 
have strong feelings against the fee referendum, but 
the Guardian also feels that it was irresponsible for 
them to improperly accuse UCAB of wrongdoing. 

UCSD Students Deserve 
An All Campus Speaker 

In the next few weeks, Chancellor Robert Dynes 
will decide whether or not to hold an all-campus 
commencement ceremony this year. UCSD's Vice 
Chancellor of Development and University 
Relations, Jim Langley, has advised Dynes not to 
hold the event. 

We at the Guardian are disappointed that Langley 
has made this recommendation, and hope that 
Chancellor Dynes will decide to keep the all-campus 
ceremony as part of this year's graduation activities. 
The students of this campus want an all-campus com-
mencement, and we feel that such a decision should 
be made by the student body. 

Canceling all-campus commencement based upon 
the numbers from last year's poorly planned event, 
would be neither fair nor tolerable to the student body. 
Langley and Dynes should now be making up for the 
shortcomings of last year by securing a strong speaker, 
rather than by punishing students. 

Langley has also argued that UCSD may not be 
able to attract a speaker of prominence this year and 
in years to come. We at the Guardian find this hard 
to believe considering the coming election year, as 
well as the nationally recognized figures we have 
attracted in the past. UCSD should have no trouble at 
all attracting a suitable speaker for this June. 

Finally, we at the Guardian hope that when mak-
ing his decision on this year's ceremony, Chancellor 
Dynes will look to the students on this campus, rather 
than to an administration that refuses to admit its fail-
ures of last year.

PRACTICAL MATTERS 
COMMENTARY: 
UCSD does not offer the 
variety of majors 
available at other schools 
By KIM HOPPER 
Contributing Writer 

If you want to major in film and 
end 'lp as the next Steven Sfielberg, 
UC:,D may not be for you. I you are 
interested in pursuing a career in 
journalism, perhaps you should go 
to school elsewhere. If you're shoot-
ing for that CEO paycheck, UCSD 
does not offer the business degree 
you're looking for. . 

Students paSSionate about future 
careers in film, journalism or busi-
ness, among many other fields, may 
be disappointed when they realize 
that they will have to settle for a 
"related major" here at UCSD. 

As a transfer student, I was sur-
prised when ( looked over the list of 
majors that the university offers. 
There are a lot of abstract majors 
such as Communications and Visual 
Arts, yet I do not know of any pro-
fessional communicators or visual 
artists. I do know of joumalists and 
film producers. 

So, where are the majors that aim 
to prepare students for careers in 
these fields? It seems that much of 
UCSO's educational experience is 
theoretical, with little emphasis 
placed on providtng students with 
the practical knowledge and skills 
necessary to face 'that ugly monster 
called the real world. Yes, theory is 
important in that it opens students' 
minds to a broad range of ideas, but 
many UCSD students feel insecure 
and out-of-place when entering the 
workplace because their knowfedge 
of the historical impact of the print-
ing press cannot help them arrange a 
newspaper layout. 

In addition to the broad, theoreti-
cal majors that make it difficult for 
students with specific interests to 
find their niche, there are also some 
majors that are altogether missing 
froln UCSO's schedule of classes. 

There are a lot of abstract 
majors such as 
Communications and Visual 
Arts, yet I do not know of 
any professional 
communicators or visual 
artists. 

Our society is becoming increasingly 
centered around business. Nearly 
every corporation in every industry 
has a business division. Yet, UCSD 
still does not offer a business major. 
The economics major is about as 
close as we can come to a business 
major. Some may feel that the two 
fields are close enough, but if we 
have three separate divisions of bio-
engineering why don't we allow 
specialization in other fields as well? 

I would not bring up UCSO's 
apparent deficiency in this area if I 
did not see so many other University 
of California campuses and state 
schools providing their students 
with a greater range of (and more 
practical) majors geared toward 
career goals. Graduates from UCSD 
will be competing with these stu-
dents for jobs, so it is essential to 
consider the differences in educa-
tional opportunities. 

UCSD offers about 90 majors, 
which on the surface appears to be a 
pretty vast collection. However, in 
comparison to its ~r universities, 
UCSD is a little behind. UCLA has 

almost 50 additional majors and also 
offers majors in subjects such as 
marine biology, business economics, 
film and television. UC Santa Cruz 
has a major named "business man-
agement economics," a comprehen-
sive major in film and video and a 
minor in journalism. UC Riverside 
also offers business administration 
and, despite its relatively small size, 
has developed unique majors like 
creative writing. Berkeley, with over 
100 majors, has everything from 
forestry and architecture to film and 
genetics. UC Santa Barbara boasts 
majors in law and society, as well as 
film. If all of these UC schools can 
offer these majors that are in tune 
with specific student interests, why 
can'tUCSD? 

Closer to home, we can compare 
UCSD to its neighboring school, San 
Diego State University (SDSU). 
SDSU offers the journalism major 
that many students at UCSD wish 
they had access to, and also offers a 
variety of business majors, like 
finance, marketing and international 
business. Specialized categories like 
criminal justice, food and nutrition, 
child development and health sci-
ence are also available as undergrad-
uate majors. 

Having a wider selection of more 
practical majors for students who 
know what they want to pursue as a 
career would heighten academic 
interest at UCSD. ~any students in

Chechen Campaign Must End Sexual Discrimination 
COMMENTARY: Innocents die under the pretense of fighting terrorism COMMENTARY: Proposition targets gays 
By DlVYA RUNCHAL 
Contributing Staff Writer 

In a land thousands of miles 
away, on another continent, a 
war is being waged. This war is 
different than most. It does not 
involve opposing super powers, 
just one giant: Russia. Chechnya, 
the tiny land that Russia is oblit-
erating, is a break-away republic 
that is in the center of a growing 
military storm. 

Missiles and rockets continue 
to strike the towns of Chechnya 
even as its leaders plead for the 
refuge of innocent civilians, 
many of them children. We often 
think of war as a complex mili-
tary battle, a giant game of chess 
played out by two equally pow-
erful warriors. Russia's battle 
against Chechnya, however, is 
comparable to the United States' 
involvement in Vietnam. 

Like the U.S. experience in 
Vietnam, Russia lost a costly war 
in 1996, one in which tens of 
thousands were killed. 
However, that humiliating 
defeat in Chechnya has not 
deterred Russia from waging a 
war against Muslim rebels, the 
prime suspects in terrorist

attacks in Russian towns. The 
United States has protested 
Russia's actions on the ~rounds 
that only circumstantial evi-
dence, if any, exists to incrimi-
nate Muslim rebels as the cause 
of terrorist blasts that killed at 
least 300 Russian citizens. 

Russia's military strategy in 
Chechnya may be a case of 
Russian roulette: The stakes are 
high and someone is bound to 

It does not make sense 
to kill unarmed children, 
women and men who 
have nothing to do with 
terrorists. 

lose. In this case, the innocent 
civilians of Chechnya - some of 
whom have already been killed 
in Russian missile strikes in 
Grozny in an open-air market, a 
maternity ward and on a civilian 
bus - are the pawns in the 
struggle between terrorist rebels 
and a super power. Chechen 
refugees are placed in a dire 
position: They are caught 
between Russian soldiers and 

Muslim rebels. 
Making the situation even 

worse is the fact that Russia has 
dosed off roads to a neighboring 
region, preventing many civil-
ians from being able to look after 
the safety of their loved ones. 

While the United States has 
voiced concerns about the plight 
of the refugees, it is essential 
that more be done. The Russian 
government cannot continue to 
attack unarmed civilians - pe0-
ple who have had no part in the 
terrorist attacks in Russian 
cities. If Russia's justification for 
carrying out these attacks is that 
these people are the source of 
aggresSive attacks on Russia, 
there is still no cause for the 
deaths of so many children in 
the open-air market attack in 
Grozny. It does not make sense 
to kill unarmed children, 
women and men who have 
nothing to do with terrorists. 

The global community must 
come together to condemn 
Russia's deplorable actions. Only 
then can it pressure Russia into 
backing down from a war that it 
hcis no justification for carrying 
out and that it may never win.

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian 

It on Riglds 
Editor: 

After having passed in the 
House of Rerresentatives, the 
"Patients' Bil of Rights" must 
now be reconciled with its coun-
terpart in the Senate. If this bill 
passes, it will diminish the free· 
dom of doctors, hospitals, insur· 
ance companies and the very 
patients it allegedly protects. 

The bill is an attempt to grant 
special privileges to some - to 
be paid for by trampling on the 
rights of others. It decrees, for 
example, that health insurance 
must provide certain benefits, 
such as longer hospital stays and 
coverage of a wider variety of 
treatments. 

But these mandated benefits 
are not free; someone has to pay 
for them. Will insurance compa· 
nies be forced to absorb the extra 
spending on these benefits? Or 
will the expense be shared by 
doctors and hospitals, who will 
be raid less for their work? Or 
wil the cost be rassed on to 
,patients, who wil have to pay 
higher premiums for health 
insurance, making it too expen· 
sive for some to afford? 

The one certainty is that 
someone will be forced to foot 
the bill to provide the care man· 
dated by Congress. When it 
comes to this "someone" -
where is the concern for his or 
her rights? 

Genuine rights - the kind 
protected by the original Bill of 
Rights - guarantee the individ· 
ual's freedom of action, includ· 
ing the act of trading with oth· 
ers, without being subject to 
government coercion. 

But the pseudo·rights being 

peddled today are actually vio-
lations of rights. They are 
attempts to dole out special gov· 
ernment Javors, to be given to 
some by taking away tne free-
dom of others. They are 
attempts to force people - the 
people whose abilities have 
made these medical services 
possible - to provide their ser· 
vices on terms they would not 
voluntarily accept. 

In fact. this anti-rights 
approach is exactly what has 
caused the very problems a 
patients' "Bill of . Rights" pre· 
tends to solve. When Medicare 
was passed in 1965, politicians 
promised that it would provide 
the elderly with a "right to 
health care." But once health 
care was "free" - i.e. paid for by 
someone else - patients (and 
doct6rs) had little incentive to 
control costs. The result was an 
ever-rising bill for taxpayers. 
Where was the concern for their 
rights? 

in the 70s and '80s, the gov· 
ernGlent "solved" the problem 
of escalating costs by imposing 
comprehensive price controls on 
doctors and hospitals - while 
still requiring them to provide 
exactly the same services. Where 
was the concern for their rights? 

In response to this squeeze, 
health·care providers shifted the 
costs to private customers, lead· 
ing to skyrocketing costs for 
anyone under 65. Where was the 
concern for their rights? 

Rising prices led to rising 
insurance premiums, and in an 
attempt to provide affordable 
coverage, insurers began to 
institute "managed care" sys·

terns. These became notorious 
for cutting costs by sacrificing 
quality. 

As a result of government 
intervention, the normal free-
market link between offering a 
qualitr product and enjoying 
finanCial success was severed. 
Instead, ' in medicine, the worse 
the service, the better the profits 
were. While every industry in 
which the free market prevailed 
experienced falling prices and 
ever·improving products -
computers are just one obvious 
example - the opposite took 
place in medicine. Prices rose 
while service was cut. 

Congress now proposes to 

address this problem - a prob-
lem caused by the government's 
systematic contempt for rights 
- by passing a patients' "Bill of 
Rights" that would expand this 
assault on rights. It generated 
this crisis by granting special 
privileges to some at the 
expense of others - and some-
how seeks to solve it by granting 
even more privileges and fur· 
ther violating the rights of those 
who are expected to pay for it 
all. 

Washington has created a sta· 
tist system under which there is 
a perpetual conflict of interest 
among all the participants in 
medical care. We do not have 
such conflicts between buyers 
and sellers of, say, bread or 
shoes or homeowners insurance. 
It is only government controls 
that have made medicine such a 
conflict-laden, bureaucrat·dri-
ven field . 

We can only begin to reverse 
the damage by upholding gen-
uine rights - the individual 
right of both patients and 
health-care providers to be free 
from government interference. If 
our politicians really want to 
fight for rights, let them fight for 
a free market in medicine.

UCAS R ....... to 
A.I. Council Lett.-

Editor: 
The letter published, by the 

A.S. Council, .in the recent 
GUllrdiRn regarding the 
University Centers wasted a lot 
of space to say one thing. The 

message is, if you don't play 
with our ball, you can't play on 
our court. 

The referendum for the expan' 
sion is very threatening to the 
AS. Council. Why? Because with 
online voting 24 hours a day, this 
election takes the power out of 
AS. Council's hands and puts it 
into the students. 

There Simply is no easier way 
to find out the will of the stu· 
dents! Voting can be completed 
from any computer terminal from 
anywhere in the world. 

UCSD students can vote from 
home or on their way to class. In 
fact, UCSD students living 
abroad can vote on the issue. 
How much more democratic can 
you get? 

How can A.S. Council in 
good conscience criticize us for 
asking the students where they 
stand? 

Think of it, AS. Council could, . 
via the same methodology, ask 
you, the student in real time what 
you think, regarding issues that 
affect you. 

We decided to find out just 
what you think, and their 
response, is to criticize the 
process. 

These will be the same folks, 
perhaps with different faces but 
the same attitudes who, in a year 
or two, will criticize UCAB for 
over-crowding, lack of space for 
their activities, etc. 

This expansion is needed, and 
can only happen with your voice. 
Does it cost money, yes, about 32 
cents per day.

PROPOSITION: 
Refusing marriage 
denies vital rights 

marriage. 
Marriage is a powerful legal 

and social force that ensures cou-
ples have acct!$ to very specific 
rights, privileges, and benefits. 
Without marriage privileges, 
same·sex couples are denied 
rights that most married people 
take for granted. For example, in 
Hawaii, because same-sex cou· 
pies are not allowed to marry, a 
gay or lesbian person is unable to 
visit their spouse in the hospital, 
inherit property from their 
spouse or enter into a pre-marital 
agreement. Same-sex couples in 
Californian face similar restric· 
tions. 

The Knight Initiative is also 
problematic "because it singles out 
a group of people and takes their 
rights away. Any initiative that 
singles out one group of 
Califomians for discrimination is 
unfair and divisive. 

Proponents of the Knight 
Initiative say that they are trying 
to protect California's children. 
However, outlawing same-sex 
marriage does nothing to help 

LEnERS: 
Online voting scares 
the A.S. Council 

non·academic facilities, so when 
the students wants to do this, we 
have to do it ourselves. 

Just remember, every problem 
that A.S. Council has with the elee· 

children. U anything, it hurts the 
children of same-sex couples. 
Without a marriage licenae, in the 
event of a break-up the children 
of same-sex couples could wind 
up in messy child custody dis-
putes. In addition, the children of 
same-sex courles deserve to have 
their parent s marriage recog-
nized in a court of law. These 
children shouldn't have to go 
through life feeling as if their par· 
ents' union is wrong. 

Proponents of the bill also 
argue that gay and lesbian cou· 
pies should be prohibited from 
marrying because same-sex mar· 
riage conflicts with Christian val· 
ues - a ridiculous argument. It is 
not the job of a proposition to leg· 
islate religious values. In addition, 
it is important to note that mar· 
riage laws do not impact religious 
beliefs or practices. Religious and 
civil marriages are two separate 
legal institutions. In fact, many 
faiths currently perform same-sex 
marriages now. The state does not 
control which marriages any reli-

~onperfu~or~,and 
religions likewise should not dic· 
tate who is able to receive a civil 
marriage license. 

Finally, we should question 
the motives of the Knight 
Initiative's sponsor. Californians 
aren't clamoring to restrict the 
rights of gays and lesbians. So 

tion is process driven, not issue 
oriented. 

Never once does A.S. Council 
say NVote no because we don't 
need new and larger facilities." 
The reason is, that we do need 
these facilities, and A.S. knows 
it. 

So, here it is: it's up to you. 
Please vote for the expansion, it is 
our future, and the future of stu· 
dents who come after us. 

The UCSD Guardian 

what has prompted this initiao 
tive? Pete Knight has a colorful 
history in the Califomra 
Legislature. In 1997, he was repri-
manded by the Legislature for 
distributing an anti-Latino poem 
to his legislative colleagues. The 
Los Angeles Times later described 
the poem as "racist," "reprehensi· 
ble," and "a gross affront to 
Latinos in general." 

When Knight is not belittling 
Latinos, he's sponsoring bills tar-
geting gays and lesbians. He has 
sponsored three anti·gay and les· 
bian bills in the legislature since 
1996; all three have failed. In 1993, 
Knight proposed eliminating the 
Commission on the Status of 
Women, which is designated by 

. the state to study issues relating to 
women in California . Knight's 
history speaks volumes about his 
willingness to target specific 
groups for discrimination. 

Knight's track record is not the 
only issue, however, with regards 
to this bill. Taken on its own, this 
piece of legislation sends 
California in the wrong direction 
- toward divisiveness and dis-
crimination, instead of equality. 
Californians should voice their 
resounding disapproval of this 
weak-minded and inflammatory 
proposal as election season 
approaches.

8 NEWS The UCSD Guardian Thursday, OcIOber 28, 1999 

u.s to Help Iraqi Opposition Develop Cadre ARMENIA: 
Armenian journalist 
was in chamber 

post-communlst era, and the 
struggle with Azerbaijan has 
kept the Armenian government 
in turmoil. Just last lear, the 
president was force out of 
office because critics believed he . 
was making too many conces-
sions in peace negotiations with 
Azerbaijan. 

WASHINGTON The 
Clinton administration has 
authorized the first direct mili-
tary training for opponents of 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, 
said senior officials Wednesday. 

Starting next week, four Iraqi 
rebel leaders, including two for-
mer officers in Iraq's armed 
forces, will attend a lo-day train-
ing course at the Air Force's spe-
cial-operations headquarters 
near Pensacola, Fla., where U.S. 
officials will teach them on how 
to organize a military in an 
emerging state. Other courses 
are being prepared. 

The administration has also 
approved its first contribution of 
surplus Pentagon equipment 
intended to help foster the over-
throw of Saddam, offering the 
main Iraqi opposition groups $2 
million worth of office supplies. 

While the initial assistance is 
modest - and, the officials 
emphasized, "nonlethal" - it 
reflects the sharp shift in policy 
toward overt support of what 
amounts to an insurgency 
against Saddam's government. 
In that sense, it recalls U.S. sup-
port in the 1980s for the Contra 
rebels in Nicaragua and for the 
mujahedeen ~uerrillas who

resisted the Soviet invasion of 
Afghanistan. 

The training and equipment, 
which includes computers, fax 
machines and file cabinets, rep-
resent the first portion of 

$97 million in aid authorized 
by Congress last year to bolster 
the fractious groups intent on 
deposing Saddam. 

"The notion here is to help 
people associated with the oppo-
sition to think about a plan for the 
country after Saddam Hussein," a 
military official who has worked 
closely with the Iraqi opposition 
said Wednesday. 

Ever since four days of U.S. 
and British air strikes against 

Iraq last December, the adminis-
tration has openly stepped up 
contacts with Iraqi opposition 
leaders. So far, those efforts 
appear to have had little impact 
on dissent inside Iraq, and offi-
cials at the Pentagon, in particu-

But the administration has 
been under increasing pressure 
from Republicans and even 
some Democrats in Congress to 
do more to support the opposi-

Iraqi opposition leaders 
strongly welcomed the support. 
Salah Shaikhly, a spokesman for 
the Iraqi National Congress, a 
coalition of exiles, said the 
equipment and training would 
be "vital to our work in Iraq." 

"'Nonlethal' doesn't mean

tion.

More Debate Expected After 
Court's Abortion Ruling 

URBANA, Ill. - Some called 
It "chilling" and "contradictory." 
Others called it "well-reasoned" 
and "remarkable." 

But no one affected by 
Tuesday's federal appeals court 
decision upholding the criminal-
ization of a rare late-term abor-
tion procedure that its opponents 
call "partial birth" was predicting 
instant change in Wisconsin or 
Illinois, the states involved. 

"Everyone is continuing as 
always," said Judy Mann, head of 
Planned Parenthood of 
Wisconsin, which shut its clinics 
for a week in 1998, shortly after 
Wisconsin's law was passed, 
because of concerns that it was 
ambiguous and that doctors who 
performed any type of abortions 
could be at risk for prosecution. 
The penalty, the most severe in 
the nation, is life in prison. 

The decision, handed down by 
the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals, contrasted sharply with a 
similar case in the 8th U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals a month ago.

LEARJET: 
NTSB investigating 
three other crashes 
ContInued from ..... 1 
diving into a South Dakota hay 
field . 

As investigators removed 
debris Wednesday, the National 
Transportation Safety Board's 
investigator in charge, Bob 
Benzon, said in a telephone inter-
view from Aberdeen,S D., that his 
agency was looking into the 1983 
crash of a German-owned Lea~et 
that flew 1,600 miles from Vienna, 
Austria, before crashing. into the 
Atlantic about 200 miles off 
Iceland, and also investigating a 
crash in Mexico that appeared to 
have been similar. 

The Federal Aviation 
Administration said its records 
showed that a Learjet crashed on 
Jan. 18, 1980, in Ohio, on a flight 
from Ypsilanti, Mich., to 
Louisville, Ky. Controllers report-
ed that the crew's speech had 

found that laws in Nebraska, 
Arkansas and Iowa banning the 
procedure were unconstitutional 
because their language mil7ht be 
interpreted to prohibit common 
and constitutionally protected 
methods of late-term abortion. 

The judges in the 7th Circuit 
did not find the Wisconsin and 
Illinois laws banning one type of 
late-term abortion unconstitu-
tional. A federal judge in Illinois 
had ruled that state's law was 
unconstitutional but a federal 
judge in Wisconsin had upheld 
the law there after a trial. But the 
7th Circuit said it would instruct 
the federal district judges han-
dling the partial-birth abortion 
cases to issue "precautionary" 
injunctions to insure that other, 
constitutionally protected abor-
tion procedures are not banned. 

The 7th Circuit judges are 
expected to issue their instructions 
to the district court judges within 
the next three weeks.

deprivation. Everyone on board 
was killed in the crash. 

Though he acknowledged 
these similarities, Benzon cau-
tioned that "it might behoove us 
to note that oxygen deprivation 
isn't the only thing that could 
have happened." 

The crash of the German 
plane seemed similar. The Lear 
25B belonging to a West German 
charter company, Air Traffic, 
took off on a flight to Hamburg, 
but kept going. As the plane 
flew over northern Europe, air 
traffic controllers were unable to 
make contact with the pilots, 
and British, Dutch and U.S. mil-
itary planes were sent to inter-
cept the plane. Two Royal Air 
Force jets caught up with the 
plane over Scotland, according 
to an Associated Press report at 
the time, which quoted one 
pilot, Lt. John Marr, as saying 
"there was certainly no one in 
the cockpit."

Helms Orders Women Out 
WASHINGTON - Sen. Jesse 

Helms, the hard-nosed chairman 
of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, ordered Capitol 
police officers Wednesday to 
remove 10 female House mem-
bers from a Senate hearing after 
he said they were disrupting the 
meeting by trying to present him 
with a fetter supporting an inter-
national treaty against discrimi-
nation against women. 

Helms, R-N.C., has blocked a 
Senate vote on the 1979 UN. 
accord and declined to meet per-
sonally with treaty supporters. 

The minor uproar began 
when Rep. Lynn Woolsey of 
California led the group of 
women, all House Democrats 
who were accompanied by some 
aides, from a Capitol Hill news 
conference to Helms' Senate 
office and then to a nearby hear-
ing room, where he was leading 
a meeting on the Clinton admin-
istration's China policy. 

The group entered quietly, 
seeking to give Helms a placard-
size letter signed by 100 mem-
bers of Congress in support of 

the Convention on the 
Elimination of all Forms of 
Discrimination Against Women. 
The pact has been ratified by 165 
countries, but not the United 
States. 

Taken aback, Helms gaveled 
the hearing to a halt and scolded 
Ms. Woolsey - "Please be a lady"

- before ordering unilonned 
officers to "Escort them out!" 

Afterward, the women 
expressed shock at the treatment 
from Helms, who is notoriously 
tough but also assumes a courtly 
air with women who appear 
before his panel. 

"While he was asking us to be 
ladies, he could have been more 

gentlemanly in treating us like 
colleagues in Congress," Rep. 
Nancy Pelosi of California said. 

The tempest marked the latest 
episode in a rocky week for 
HeIms. Last week, he made clear 
that he opposed the nomination 
of Carol Moseley-Braun to be 
ambassador to New Zealand. 
Democrats seized on the com-
ments about Ms. Moseley-Braun, 
the first black woman elected to 
the Senate, to accuse Helms and 
othen of racial insensitivity. 

Rep. Richard Gephardt, the 
House Democratic leader, 
decried the chairman's actions, 
saying, "If they were kicked out 
of a hearing of the Congress, 
that's wrong."

Coca-Cola Tests Vending Machines That 
Can Raise Prices in Hot Weather 

Taking full advantage of the 
law of supply and demand, the 
Coca-Cola Co. has quietly begun 
testing a vending machine that 
can automatically raise prices 
for its drinks in hot weather. 

"This technology is some-
thing the Coca-Cola Co. has 
been looking at for more than a 
year," said Rob Baskin, a compa-
ny spokesman, adding that it 
had not yet been placed in any 
consumer market. 

The potential was heralded, 
though, by the company's chair-
man and chief executive in an 
interview earlier this month 
with a Brazilian newsmagazine. 
M. Douglas Ivester, the chair-
man, described how desire for a 
cold drink can increase during a 
sports championship final held 
in the summer heat. 

"So, it is fair that it should be 
more expensive," Ivester was 

quoted as saying in the magazine, 
Veja. "The machine will simply 
make this process automatic." 

The process appears to be 
done simply through a tempera-
ture sensor and a computer chip, 
not a."y breakthrough technolo-
gy, though Coca-Cola refused to 
provide any details Wednesday. 

While the concept might 
seem unfair to a thirsty person, it 
essentially extends to another 
industry what has become the 
practice for airlines and other 
companies that sell products and 
services to consumers. The 
falling price of computer chips 
and the increasing ease of con-
necting to the Internet has made 
it practical for companies to pair 
daily and hourly fluctuations in 
demand with fluctuations in 
price - even if the product is a 
can of soda that sells for 75 cents. 

Vending machines have 

become an increasingly impor-
tant source of profits for Coca-
Cola and its archrival, PepsiCO. 

Over the last three years, the 
soft-drink giants have watched 
their earnings erode as they 
waged a price war in supermar-
kets. Vending machines have 
remained largely untouched by 
the discounting. Now, Coc~­
Cola aims to tweak what has 
been a golden goose to extract 
even more profits. 

Industry reactions to the new 
machine ranged from enthusias-
tic to sanctimonious. 

"It's another reason to move 
to Sweden," one beverage indus-
try executive sniffed. "What's 
next?A machine that X-rays pe0-
ple's pockets to find out how 
much change they have and rais-
es the price accordingly?"

CalSAS Educates ·Students ~ . , 4 
SWEATSHOP: New group will work to alleviate unfair labor practices 
By EVELYN FRANKS 
Guardian Reporter 

Students from . across 
California met last weekend to 
highlight the problems of sweat-
shop labor and to promote ways 
of alleviating the problem both 
on a campus and global level. 

The tw«Klay conference, held 
at UC BerkeIey, marked the first 
official California Students 
Against Sweatshops (CaISAS) 
conference. 

The purpose of CalSAS is to 
give more attention to the issue 
of sweatshop Jabor. On Tuesday, 
CalSAS asked UC Vice President 
Wayne Kennedy to sign a docu-
ment promising that the 
University of California will 
only conduct business with 
companies that practice fair 
employment standards.

BIOLOGY: 
Reorganization plan 
will cost $133,500 
c.tIIIII ............ 1 

The department of biology has 
already shuffled around this year, 
both as a trial period and in antic-
ipation of the plan~5 approval. 
However, no new facultY have 
been hired. 

The new positions make up 
the bulk of the cost of the 
department's reorganizatton, 
said bioloKY Professor Deborah 
Spector. S6e said the total new 
cost to the department would be 
$133,500. 

Four new chairs will oversee 
molecular biology, cell and 
development biology, neurobiol-
ogy and ecology disciplines. 
This will free the new dean to 
more actively seek outside 
resources and development 
opportunities, Subramani said. 

at the conference. Those attend-
ing were educated on sweatshop 
conditions and ways of raising 
awareness about the issue. 

Vu said that on the first day 
of the conference, participants 

Those attending were 
educated on sweatshop 
conditions and ways of 
raising awareness about 
the issue. 

were informed about the vari-
ous offenses women working in 
sweatshops have to endure. 

Chie Abad, a former gar-
menf-factory worker on the 
island of Saipan, a U.S. territory, 
related her first-hand experience 
of working in a sweatshop. She 
said she nad to live in over-
crowded barracks and work up 

The departmenfs 
student-to-teacher ratio 
- currently 62 to 1 -
compromises teaching 
and research, 
Subrarnani stated. In 
1997, 28 percent of 
UCSD undergraduates 
were biology majors; 9 
percent of UCSD faculty 
is in the biology 
department. 

"This will al10w UCSD and 
the department of biology to have 
better visibili'l nationally and 
international1y, Subramani said 

The new positions will also 
help to improve the faculty 
review process, the proposal 
stated. 

A nationwide search for a 
dean will begin immediately after 

to 16 hours a day in order to 
repay her contract bill. Two 
other former sweatshop workers 
from EI Salvador, Sonia Beatriz 
Lara and Eva Nerio Ponce, also 
described similar experiences. 

Participants in the conference 
were also brought to a union-
ized garment factory in 
Oakland. Vu said that there were 
very few people working there 
due to competition from the 
low-wage-paying sweatshops. 
She said she thought that 
because of unemployment at the 
factory, it would not be in busi-
ness much longer. 

The crux of the problem lies 
with corporations that employ 
wDrkers at below minimum wage 
to manufacture apparel, Vu said. 

She added that she hopes 
CalSAS can eventually make a 
difference and ensure that large 
corporations "treat workers 
with dignity." 

Dynes approves the proposal. 
Biology's graduate and 

undergraduate curricula will 
remain unchanged. 

Undergraduate advising and 
administration will also stay the 
same through the reorganization. 

Forty-five Academic Senate 
voting members voted in sup-
port of the new qivision of biol-
ogy. Four voted against the pro-
posal and one abstained. 

"This was a very strong 
endorsement," Senior Vice 
Chancellor Marsha Chandler 
said. 

Chandler said she sees no 
reason why Dynes would not 
~gree with the Academic Senate 
recommendation. 

In other action, the Academic 
Senate combined the Committee 
on Affirmative Action and the 
Committee on Student 
Affirmative Action. The one 
committee is now referred to as 
the Committee on Affirmative 
Action and Diversity.

SAN DIEGO - A local busi-

San Diego State University 
(SDSU) last week to help launch 
its new hospitality and tourism 
management degree program. 

L. Robert Payne, owner of 
Mission Valley's Hilton and 
Hanalei Hotels, pledged the 
money as capital for the program. 

The new degree has been 
approved by both the Academic 
Resources and Planning 
Committee of SDSU's University 
Senate, said Gene Lamke, chair-
man of the department of recre-
ation, parks and tourism at SDSU 
and co-author of the proposal. 

The new degree program is 
offered by the College of 
Professional Studies and Fine 
Arts and the College of Business 
Administration. 

Once the Fall ~1 SDSU 
catalog is published, students can 
begin taking courses toward this 
major. However, they cannot 
declare a hospitality and tourism 
management major until Fall 2001. 

It is estimated that between 50 
and 100 students will enter the 
new degree program in its first 
year and that enrollment will top 
out in five to six years at 400 to 
450 students, Lamke said. 

In November, the proposal 
will go to the University Senate

ContIIIued froM ..... 1 
problem was with the test or 
with his knowledge of 
dichloroacetic acid. 

"When I wrote the letter, I 
wasn't sure I was right," 
Khaleghi said. " I was just look-
ing for an explanation." 

Immediately after the exam, 
he asked other students if they 
had noticed the same error. Other 
students either thought they had 
chosen the correct answer or 
couldn' t remember the question, 
Khaleghi said. 

"People are pressed for time 
- you leam to skip questions," 
Khaleghi added. 

He said another reason other 
test-takers might have missed 
the error is because of tricky 
wording in the answer options 
given. 

"I was just very stuck on this 
question," Khaleghi said. "I'm 
stubborn." 

His stubborn nature helped 
lead to the re-scoring of between 
20,000 to 30,000 exams, said John 
Hackett, associate director for 
MCAT operations. Fifty-six thou-
sand students took the August 
exam, but the error did not affect 
all versions. 

All affected students' scores 
were re-evaluated and do not 
include the flawed question, 
Hackett said. 

"I didn' t think that there were 
actually mistakes on the MCAT," 
Khaleghi said. 

Hackett said the missing 
answer was not an error in the 
MCAT, but an error in the ques-
tion. 

Khaleghi said he is not 
extremely familiar with metabol-
ic biochemistry. 

"The interesting thing about 
the question is that no prior 
knowledge was needed," he said. 
"Everything needed to answer 
the question was included in the 
question."

395 patents in 1998 - more than 
any other university in the coun-
try - according to a report 
released Friday by the U.S. 
Department of Commerce Patent

The large number of patents 
given to schools in the UC sys-
tem means these institutions are 
innovation leaders, said Maria 
Hernandez, a spokesperson for 
the patent and trademark office. 

But UC spokesperson Mary 
Spletter said the UC system's rank-
ing is a result of multiple factors. . 

"It means various things," 
Spletter said. "It shows we are 
actively making breakthroughs, 
and it has a likelihood of revenue 
return." 

The UC system made $88.5 
million in revenue from the 
patents during the 1998 fiscal year, 
Spletter said. University 
spokespersons added that the rev-
enue comes from licensing agree-
ments with outside companies.

alloween has become one of 
the most important, oldest and 
widely celebrated festivals on 
the contemporary American 
calendar. However, it is not 
officially a holiday because 
there is no Nday oW for the cel-

ebration nor is there a federal decree that 
declares Halloween to be a national holiday. 

People celebrate Halloween as a type Of for- . 
mality and tradition. What many do not know, 
however, is that Halloween descends from a 
2,OOO-year-old Celtic fire festival called Samhain 
(pronounced sow-in) and that the day used to be 
a time of terror and grief. 

The Celts lived 2,000 years ago in the area 
that is now Ireland, th,e United Kingdom and 
northern France. They celebrated their new year 
on Nov. 1, a day which marked the end of sum-
mer and the harvest, as well as the beginning of 
the dark, cold winter. 

The Celts were a pastoral people as opposed 
to agricultural, and they feared that when win-
ter came, the sun they worshiped would be 
killed by the powers of darkness. They also 
believed that on the night before the new year, 
the boundary between the worlds of the living 
and the dead, or the "veil between the worlds," 
was at its thinnest. At this time, it was thought, 
the souls of the dead also roamed in the land of 

The UCSD Guardian 

the living. 
To appease the otherwordly spirits that 

would come that day, the Druids, or Celtic 
priests, built sacred bonfires where the people 
gathered to bum crops and animals in wicker 
cages as sacrifices to the Celtic deities. They did 
so noping that the evil powers would allow the 
sun to return. 

Samhain was also called La Samon and the 
Feast of the Sun. After the ceremony, all the 
hearth fires of the individual houses were to be 
extinguished and were re-lit from the sacrificial 
fire of the sacred bonfire. The Celts believed that 
·this practice protected them during the coming 
winter. 

Folk traditions also tell us of the many div-
ination practices associated with Samhain. For 
example, the Druids made predictions dealing 
with marriage, weather and the coming fortunes 
for the year using different methods. They pre-
dicted marriages through a method called 
"ducking for apples," where the first person to 
bite an apple would be the first to marry in the 
coming year. And to see how long a person 
would live, they used "apple peeling," wherein 
the longer the unbroken apple peel, the longer 
one's life was destined to be. These prophecies 
were an important source of comfort and direc-
tion during the long, harsh winter. 

At these ceremonies, the Celts wore costumes 

HIATUS 13 

made of animal heads and skins, so that they 
would remain incognito to the ghosts they 
might encounter as they left their houses. This is 
why people dress in costumes for Halloween 
today. 

In 43 A.D., the Romans conquered the major-
ity of Celtic territory, and in the 400 years that 
they ruled the Celtic lands, two festivals of 
Roman origin were added to the traditional 
Celtic celebration of Samhain. The first was Fer-
alia, a day in late October intended to give rest 
and peace to the departed. The second day hon-
ored Pomona, the Roman goddess of fruit and 
trees. The symbol of Pomona is the apple and 
the incorporation of this celebration into 
Samhain probably explains today's Halloween 
tradition of bobbing for apples. 

By the 9th century, Christianity had spread 
into Celtic lands, and Pope Boniface IV intro-
duced Nov. 1 as All Saints' Day to honor saints 
and martyrs. He also Wanted to replace the 
pagan festival of the dead with a church-sanc-
tioned holiday. Church leaders even went so far 
as to assign new Christian meanings to the 
residual symbols of Samhain. 

Later in the eleventh century, the church 
decre~ Nov. 2 to be All Souls' Day, a day to 
honor all of the dead, not just the early Christian

'Bringing Out the Dead' Lacks a Pulse 
Martin Scorsese's latest film falls short ofits potential despite strong acting and supporting characters 
IJDAVlDYIN 
StaffM1tw 

"Bringing Out the Dead" fea-
lUres a great actor (Nicolas Cage) 
paired with a great director (Mar-
W" Scorsese), presenting a great 
conQ!Pl through the work of great 
photography. Yet, it still falls 
short of being a great film. Like 
many recent movies, "Dead" fal-
ters by tackling too many com-
plex issues in too short a time. 

The film shuffles colorful char-
acters through a largely incoher-
ent plot, at times substituting out-
rageous satire and flashy camera-
work for weak links in the story. 
In the end, however, the film suc-
ceeds in demonstrating the guts 
and glory of being a paramedic, 
as well as the toll it can take on an 
ordinary human being. 

Cage is excellent as Frank 
Pierce, a burned-out medic who 
works the graveyard shift in one 
of New York's toughest neighbor-
hoods. Not having saved a soul in 
over a year, Frank stumbles 
through his job like a zombie, 
never fully alNake or asleep. 

Every day, Pierce begs his boss 
to fire him, then grudgingly 
accepts his duties, praying for a 
lack of emergency. We are made 
privy to the fact that Pierce is 
haunted by the memory of a par-
ticutar teenage girl whom he 
failed to save. This incident, over-
ly emphasized in the film, threat-
ens to tip him over the brink to 
insanity as he searches for that 

.... Iu •• a 
M.NAIIMI.,. 

PRO.RNt 

elusive redemption that never 
really materializes. 

The film features some out-
standing actors in supporting 
roles, including John Goodman, 
Tom Sizemore and Ving Rhames 
as paramedics, each plagued by 
a different personality disorder. 
Along with Cage, they illustrate 
what the stressful and turbulent 
paramedic profession can do to 
an individual. With their actions 
and attitudes, each of these other 
medics reaffirm the audience's 
belief that while Pierce is flawed, 
he may be the only sane one and 
the best hope in a bleak exis-
tence. 

Scorsese might have opted to 
apply this concept further, per-
haps showing Pierce in more 
heroic roles which had him break-
ing out of his downward spiral to 
help save lives. Instead, every 
time you think Pierce is ready to 
redeem himself, he degenerates 
into something incomprehensible 
and shrugs off the positives. By 
the end, you find yourself no 
longer rooting for him. 

The low point of the film is 
Pierce's relationship with the 
daughter of one of his victims, 
played by Cage's real-life wife 
Patricia Arquette. Pierce's awk-
ward courting of this character 
shows his vulnerability and thirst 
for a normal life. The scenes 
between them, however, unfold 
at a snail's pace, ear-marked with 
tin-like dialogue and contradic-
tion. Furthermore, they distract

Creative CosmmeConcepts f ~ . 
You 'fie got a mere 72 hours to get into costume, we're gonna help you out 
By MAURENE GOO 
Staff Writer 

Halloween is only three days 
away, leaving students who have 
actually been focusing on their 
studying wondering what they 
can do for a costume. Have no 
fear, your hero is here. 

K-Mart is out. Most of its little 
. ' costumes are either of M&:M's, 

Pokemon characters or anything 
out of Star Wars. Even if Pikachu 
is your dream costume, K-Mart 
focuses on a younger crowd, 
leaving college students in the 
lurch. 

For the rest of you who are 
seriously looking for something 
good but are running out of time, 
there's still hope. Start looking for 
vintage clothing - no matter 
what you wear, you'll be in cos-
tume. 

Start by looking around for an 
affordable place to get period 
p-ieceS, whether you want to be a 
70s disco queen or a roaring '20s 
flapper. There are many thrift and 
vintage stores in San Diego that 
offer a variety of clothing for 
cheap prices. 

The Salvation Army and 
Goodwill are always extremely 

affordable options and both are 
located downtown. They offer a 
wide selection of used clothing 
and shoes excellent for perioo 
pieces or other costume ideas. 

For those who are looking for 
'305 and '405 gear, St. 
Bartholomew's Thrift Shop is 
your best bet for finding authen-
tic vintage pieces from that era. 
Located in the Carriage Center, 
you can also look around at other 
vintage stores located there. 
Prices may be higher, but so is the 
quality. 

The '60s and '70s are always 
popular, and there are endless 
possible costume combinations in 
these two colorful decades. A few 
shops that specialize in this peri-
od are Retro Fit Vintage Clothing, 
Shake Rag, Aaardvarks and Buf-
falo Exchange. 

At Retro Fit there is a huge 
selection of vintage dresses as 
well as '70s polyester jumpsuits. 
Shake Rag sells rebel shirts, 
striped '70s polyester tops, vin-
tage dresses and Hawaiian and 
vintage shirts. Both Aaardvarks 
and Buffalo Exchange offer racks 
of vintage clothing as well as 
accessories including shoes, 
boas and hats. Aaardvarks also 

sells '50s clothing: leather jack-
ets, poodle skirts and prom 
dresses. 

Costume ideas may come to 
you just from walking through 
some of these stores, but for those 
of you who are still stumped, 
there are still many quick and 
easy options. 

Television show characters are 
probably one of the easiest to pull 
off, all you need to do is think of 
a popular, distinctive-looking 
character and find clothes in your 
closet or someone else's that the 
character would wear. 

Take "Buffy the Vampire Slay-
er" for example. All it would 
take for a girf (or guy) to dress 
up as the butt-kicking Buffy 
Summers would be to find a 
short skirt, knee-high boots, a 
blond wig, a long coat and some-
thing that would pass for a 
wooden stake. A cross necklace 
would also add to the look. 

Popular movies also have 
great characters to imitate. For 
example, Mary, from "There's 
Something About Mary." A sum-
mery i:iress and a short, blonde 
wig with some hair-raising gel 
would get you that perfect look in 
seconds. 

Keeping the hair gel in mind, 
guys can pull on a loud Hawaiian 
shirt and create Jim Carrey's hair-
style and look in "Ace ~tura: 
Pet Detective." There are endless 
ideas in this category. Just think 
of some of your favorite movies 
and you'll be sure to think of a 
great costume. 

Then . there is always the 
bloody-anything category. You 
can wear pretty much anything, 
from a prom dress to pajamas and 
spread fake blood all over your-
self. Once that's done, you can 
label yourself as the Dead Prom 
Queen or Slaughtered Sleepover 
Victim. 

Uniforms are also easy cos-
tumes, and all this idea requires is 
borrowing someone's uniform or 
using your own. Some quick 
examples could be a cheerleader, 
Md}(malds worker, football play-
er or police officer. 

So it- you're feeling lost on 
this year's costume idea, know 
that you don't have to shell out 
big bucks for a great costume. 
And if you find yourself search-
ing frantically 10 minutes 
before a big Halloween bash, 
never fear! Fake blood to the 
rescue.

~ ~Jr1t~Cd~ ~~l 
bands of a few~ears ago scream 
not only throu Les Savy Fav's 
guitars, but a so through their 
drum beats, vocals, song titles 
and album artwork. 

The five-piece group kicks off 
its songs with the "we're-tamg-
over-this-city" attitude that Drive 
Like Jehu pioneered. "Titan" is 
not only a .sop& title aMiniature 

would.mve~n\ployed, but also 
sound&. .~~e iii S0qg t~y would 
have written. And quirky San 
Diego veteran- band Heavy Veg-
etable shines through the vocal 
track on "The Orchard." 

WiUt some songs reaching as 
far as to emulate Pavement (the 
last minute of the poppy.ish "Dis-
honest Don Part II" may actually 
be a Pavement song) and early 
'90s Fugazi ("We've Got Boxes" 
sounds like it was taken right off 
of the D.C. band's album, Steady 
Diet of Nothing), Tire Cat and the 
Cobra plays like a best-of-indie-
rock compilation. 

HISTORY: 
European immigrants 
brought customs 
ContInued from ..... 13 
saints, thus reinforcing the associ-
atioh of the season with the older 
tradition of the Celts. By that 
time, the once occult-like over-
tone tumed into a jovial harvest 
celebration. 

When European immigrants 
came to America, they brought their 
Halloween customs with them. 
These customs were practiced 
mainly in Maryland and the south· 
em colonies because New England 
was rigidly Protestant. Neverthe-
less, the beliefs and customs of dif· 
ferent European ethnic groups and 
the American Indians shaped Hal" 
loween into what it is today.

DEAD: 
'Dead' is worth the 
price of admission 

But the complexity and 
thought that warrant the title 
"math" rock are missing from the 
Savy Fav's attempt at it. And the 
attempt at a Fugazi-soundlng 
tune lacks the energy for which 
the band has come to be known. 
Even "The End," a return to late-
'8Os skate punk, doesn't scream 
360s and kickflips.

** On It Mtllns Everything, the 
group's debut from two years 
ago, Save Ferris brought ska to 
the mainstream. It seems that 
with their new album, Save Ferris 
are simply trying to be that -
mainstream. 

Instead of sticking to their 
roots, Save Ferris have, for the 
most pa.rt, shed their ska skin and 
ModiJtta, trying to be eclectic, try-
ing to be commercial, trying to be 
more than the typical Orange 
CountJ"sb band. And they have 
failed. 

Songs such as "No Love," 
"One More Try," "Hold On" and 
"Let Me In" are merely weak 
attempts at capturing a new audio 

In the second half of the 19th 
century, many Irish immigrants 
fled to America because of Ire-
land's 1864 potato famine. The 
Irish influenced Americans to 
wear costumes and go door-to-
door asking for food or money. 
Irish young women also believed 
that they could divine who their 
husband would be through little 
tricks using yam, apple parings or 
mirrors. 

In the late 18005, Halloween 
became more of a holiday about 
community and neighborly get-
togethers. By the tum of the century, 
IJe<?ple began having Halloween 
parties. 

By the 19205 and 19305, vandal-
ism began to plague Halloween 
celebrations, prompting town lead-
ers to limit the festivities, and soon 
the holiday became aimed more 
toward children.

ence. It's not that the band can't 
play; Monique Powell (lead 
vocals) and Brian Mashburn (gui-
tars, keyboards and vocals) are 
very talented. It is just that they 
try to do too much with their sica 
foundation. 

While other ska bands such as 
Reel Big Fish, the Aquabats and 
Skankin' Pickle thrive off a com-
bination of homs, vocals, guitars 
and various other instruments, 
Save Ferris allow a single element 
to dominate their songs. That 
domination is best exemplified by 
Powell, who overstretches her 
range on Modified· 

The end result is an album of 
wishy-washy songs that sound 
nothing like the old Silve Ferris 
who put out previous hits we've 
all grown to love such as "Spam," 
U1l\e World Is New" and a coyer 
of "Come On Eileen." 

However, in the mix of things, 
there are some potentially classic 
ska riffs on the new album. "Tum 
It Up," which the band played at 
UCSD's FaUfest last Friday, is a 
great example of Save Ferris tak· 
ing ska to a new level. "Your 
Love" is Save Ferris, and ska, 
both at their best. 

For listeners who aren't ska 
fans or who love No Doubt (the 
commercialized version of ska), 
Modi/iLd may be a treat, but dedi-
cated Save Ferris fans will be 
somewhat disappointed and left 
with a feeling of abandonment, 
knowing that Save Ferris is on 
the verge of completely selling 
out. 

There is No Doubt in my mind 
that Save Ferris has definitely 
been Modified.

Around the 1950s, trick-or-treat-
ing was revived. Families thought 
that if they gave out little treats, 
they would avoid the tricks that 
would otherwise plague them. 

Today, news stories tell us of a 
few demented individuals who 
pass out things like marijuana, 
LSD or even razor blades to inno-
cent trick-or-treaters. These sto-
ries make the public suspicious of 
the sinister aura surrounding 
Halloween. 

Nevenheless, this new Ameri-
can tradition survived, and it con-
tinues to grow. Today, Halloween 
has lost its superstitious and reli-
gious overtones. Americans spend 
$2.5 billion annually on Halloween, 
making it the country's second-
largest commercial holiday. This 
holiday has become a fun day to 
look forward to for many children, 
as well as parents. 

"We let people know that hip-
hop is bigger than anyone coun-
try or culture. Hip-hop is world-
wide. Did you know there is an 
insane mar.ket in Tazmania? 
Everybody there was white and 
that show was live. Look, we're 
not at a rally. All those smiles are 
what makes us do what we do. 

"Maybe I should be in poli-
tics," Chuck said with a smile. 
"As an ambassador." 

lack the recognition and apprecia-
tion. "Dead" may not win any 
Oscars, but it might make us 
think next time we hear those 
sirens off in the distance.

throughout San Diego.

FOOTBALL: 
Games not exactly 
NFL caliber 
ContInued from .... 24 
approached what would have 
been, in a normal, full-contact 
football game, close to the con-
clusion of the first quarter, he 
knew he would have to give this 
receiver a few chucks. No big 
deal; just don' t get penalized for 
unsportsman-like conduct. 

But the guy needed to be care-
ful because the referee in this 
afternoon 's game was as nit-
picky as a whistle-happy EPA 
inspector surveying a toxic-
waste dump near Lake Erie. He 
even had the nerve to flag one of 
the burly linemen for simulating 
a cadence in order to try to draw 
the opposing team offsides. 

If Jimmy Johnson had been the 
roach of the guy's team on that 
Friday afternoon, he certainly 
would have lost the well-defined 
part in his hair when going 
bonkers on the sideline, and he 
might have even gone onto the 
field to attack the referee - then 
again, it was only an intramural 
game. 

So, the guy's team had no real 
coach on that afternoon and no 
real leadership either - only 
some emotionally charged griz-
zly bears wanting to win their 
first game of the season without 
sustaining any injuries like those 
suffered in last week's contest. 

He can remember it vividly 
despite the shock he took to his 
head: I'm going to get as quick a 
start as I can out of the backfield in 
order to lay a block on this guy ... in 
fact, why should I slow down ... 
there seems to be blood f/owinK from 

The UCSD Guardian 

So, the guy's team had 
no real coach on that 
afternoon and no real 
leadership either - only 
some emotionally 
charged grizzly bears 
wanting to win their first 
game of the season 
without sustaining any 
injuries like those 
suffered in last week's 
contest. 

the skin near my eyebrow. 
That would be one of the few 

instances where the guy would 
take himself out of the game. The 
important thing to note was that 
he never lost consciousness. 

In any event, this was another 

Friday afternoon. and bl the end 
of the first half, his team s quarter-
back had thrown a series of lame 
ducks into the end zone. Each one 
of his throws sailed more than 20 
yards through the air - but only 
one or two for completions. 

The QB refused to even 
attempt to utilize the short-pass-
ing game so characteristic of suc-
cessful offenses. Y.A.C., the guy 
thought to himself, yards after 
the catch - a much-underrated 
statistic, even at this level of 
Friday aftemoon, AA-intramural 
competition. The team couldn't 
believe it, the fans in attendance 
and those on the sidelines wait-
ing to play next couldn't ~lieve 
It and the guy couldn't believe it. 

Nevertheless, his team contin-
ued to rely on its defense to stay 
in the game. After one half: 0-0. 
The rest of the Friday afternoon 
saga - to be continued.

HALL: 
Rose should be in 
the Hall of Fame • · fa 
CDRII ............. U 
members have been dRing to ,Pete 
Rose for the last 10 years. 

For those of you who don't 
know the story, Rose put together 
sure-fire Hall of Fame credentials 
in a career that spanned over 22 
years. He was revered as the 
quintessential baseball player, a 
hard-working athlete who ~ver 
took anything for granted. 
Baseball fans everywhere could 
look up to him because he didn't 
have the talent of many baseball 
players, but he worked ' hard ' 
enough to make it to the top. 
After his career was over he had 
amassed an astounding 4256 hits, 
the most in baseball history. 

Shortly after his retirement, an 
. investigation was opened and it 
was found that he had bet on the 
Reds while he still played for 
them. He was banned from base-
ball and banned from Hall of 
Fame consideration. 

For those of you who are base-
ball fans, this is old news. 
However it was brought to the 
forefront again before Game 2 of 
the World Series. 

This was when the all-centu ry 
team, as voted by the fans, was 
revealed . Pete Rose was one of 
the 30 who made the team. 

I don' t want to get into 
whether or not the rules allowed 
him to be there, the point is the 
guy should be reinstated . 

He made a mistake, a really 
bad mistake that violated the 
rules of baseball as they stood 
and still do stand . But just like in 
my example above, this shouldn' t 
tarnish the fact tha t he was one of 
the greatest ball players to have 
ever played the game. 

Did he deserve to make the all-
century team? Probably not. Frank 
Robinson didn't make it and he 
was certainly a better ball player 

, than Rose. _ This was obviously 
baseball fans crying ou~ for com-
missioner Selig to right a wrong. 

If he had bet against his oWn 
team winning, I could under-
stand the harsh treatment. In that 
case he would have been using 
his own power as manager of a 
baseball team to further his per-
sonal well-being and hurt the 
game in the process. In truth, all 
he did was have enough confi-

de~ce in his team to place a wager 
on Its success. 

So Selig, if you didn't get the 
message from the all-century vot-
ing, lef me spell it out for you 
here and now. Reinstate Rose and 
put him in the Hall of Fame 
where he belongs. Give the man 
his " A" and don't stick him with 
a "C-" he doesn't deserve. 

FENCING: 
Men and women 
open season well 
ContInued frGlft ..... 23 
Sunday at Caltech, the Tritons got 
off to a healthy beginning for this 
season, with three team members 
placing somewhere in the top 
three. Kulla-Mader finished first 
in women's epee, Bellanca took 
second in both men's eppe and 
foil while Min An took third in 
men's epee. Second-year fencer 
Jessica Fripp also had a strong 
showing at the competition, 
showing remarkable improve-
ment from last year by finishing 
fourth. 

Lee sees his team's chances at 
beating Cal State Fullerton as 
high for the both his men's and 
women's teams. He said that the 
women's rivalr will be interesting 
throughout the season. 

"We'll see who steps up and 
has the talent and courage to fight 
at that position," Lee said, com-
menting on these circumstances.

Fencing Begins Strong 
SWASHBUCKLE: Epee, foil and sabre teams 
perfonn well at collegiate open 
By BRIAN WELLES 
Associate Sports Editor 

Holy Shinobi! Where did the 
offseason go? 

It's hard to believe, but, the 
fencing season is back in full 
swing with a wonderful crew of 
sword-whipping UCSD students 
geared toward winning. 

Team championships are not 
the name of the game in this 
domain of intercollegiate 
recreation. Rather, the 
part of the season that 
most sports 
fans would 
consider the 
" postsea-
son" actually 
ronsists of one-on-one bat-
tles at the western regional 
championships at the end of the 
season. 

While teams are striving to 
produce wins over other schools, 
individual recognition is also at 
the forefront in the minds of those 
competing. 

"Fencing is kind of screwy in a 
way," Head Coach Stuart Lee 
said. "The players fence as indi-
viduals in the championships." 

UCSD may be as concerned as 
every other school is about solid 
individual performances from 
players, but the Tritons have a 
special desire as a team to unseat 
Cal State Fullerton as No. 1 in the 
final standings. 

Last year, behind a former 
Olympian head coach, the 
Fullerton squad managed to 
account for two of the Tritons' 
losses. The other Ims for UCSD 
was an upset victory at the 

hands of UCSB. UCSD's 7-3 
record was second to CSU 
Fullerton and the Tritons are 
planning to develop their ath-
letes at the three different 
weapons based on where 
Fullerton's strengths lie. 

At the helm of Lee's squad of 
fencers are men's foil captain Wes 
Bellanca, team captain Julia 
Kulla-Mader, and a strong veter-

an and freshman class who led 
their team into battle last 
Sunday, Oct. 24 in an unoffi-

.' cial "warm-
up," Lee said. 
A number of 

Triton veteran 
fencers were unable to com-
pete but figure to play 
prominently this weekend. 

These returning starters include 
Tedd Padgitt, the team's strongest 
fencer last year, and Kristin 
Johnson, an experienced 
women's foilist. 

The female team captains of 
UCSD's three weapons - epee, 
foil and sabre - include Kulla-
Mader, Josephine Roberts and a 
still undetermined saber captain. 
Craig Johnson, Wes Bellanca and 
an unchosen sabre captain lead 
the UCSD men. 

Sunday's matches were part of 
an opening invitational in which 
eight schools - UC Irvine, 
UalD, UC Santa Barbara, Cal 
State Fullerton, Cal tech, UCLA 
and Cal State Los Angeles - got 
a chance to flaunt their skills in an 
exhibition that did not count in 
the win-loss column. 

At the exhibition match last

He shows up on Friday 
afternoons to play. The big 
guys show up on Sunday 
afternoons, but he shows up 
on Fridays. He's never had the 
opportunity to defend any 
titles. He's never experienced 
the glory of/layoff action. 
He's just use to playing in 
regular-season action. He's 
used to playing hard, though, 
and this day was no exception. 

He was tired from a long 
week, but his mood would not 
deter him from the glory of 
flag football. So it was just 
another afternoon on the field, 
right? 

Wrong. It was a defensive 
slug fest. The opening posses-
sion saw the opposing team 
almost break some big runs, 
but even worse, there were a 
few balls thrown into the end 
zone that almost got through 
his outstretched arms and into 
those of the 6' 3" wide receiver 
wearing the '4gers jersey and 
black basketball shorts. What a 
jerk, thinking he could turn on 
the thrusters and beat him to 
the end zone.

Let me begin by illustrating 
a hypothetical situation. Let's 
say I am in organic chemistry

thetical); I am not the best 0-
chern student, but I work 
harder than anyone else in the 
class. Every night I am up 
until 5 a.m. studying my 
mechanisms and how to add 
oxides, or whatever all you sci-
entific types do. 

When I take the final exam, 
everyone walking out says it 
was the hardest test they have 
ever taken, but I know that all 
my studying will payoff in an 
"A." 

When I check Studentlink 
two weeks later I see that I did 
indeed ace the exam, and so I 
decide to celebrate. I have all 
my friends over and get com-
pletely sloshed and sleep off my 
hangover for the next two days. 

When my professor gets 
word of this he calls me up 
(again, this is obviously a 
myth) and says that because I 
got so drunk he is moving my 
grade from an "A" to a "C-."

this is fair?

WHnEWASH: UCSD's Women's Soccer team defeats Mar.ters College in dominant fashion 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Staff Writer 

It was just another night, and 
like most evenings, it resulted in 
another win for the UCSD 
Women's Soccer team. 

There were no surprises at 
home on Tuesday night as the 
Tritons easily defeated Masters 
College, winning 3-0. 

"We got three good goals," 
UCSD women's soccer Head 
Coach Brian McManus said. 
"They weren't lucky or scrappy. 
They were good goals. We're not 
giving up." 

The UCSD women, who have 
been rode roughshod through 
any opponent unfortunate 
enough to get in their path, have 
been on a tear as of late, winning 
eight in a row outscoring 
their opponents 42-1. 

Tuesday's game 
versus Masters 
wasn't anything 
new. 

The Tritons 
dominateli the visiting 
team so thoroughly that the 
Mustangs d d not even take a 
shot. Not a single ball flew toward 
the Triton goal in 90 minutes of 
play. The two Triton goalkeepers 
Oennifer Hetland and Laura 
Dolkas) had the easiest nights of 
their lives. 

The Tritons possessed feet of 
fire, launching 32 shots, 13 of 
which came on goal. Masters 
goalkeeper Rachel Lindvall was 
forced to scramble in front of the 
net, saving 10. 

Just as remarkable, the Tritons 
had 20 comer-kick opportunities, 
taking advantage of their aggres-
sive play. Unfortunately, Lindvall 
was having a good evening and 
UCSD was unable to connect on a 
single opportunity. 

Both teams subbed their entire 
squads during the mop-up 
action. 

It took nearly seven minutes, 
but UCSD's Christy Abizaid 
handily cracked the simple defen-

• 
sive code of the Mustangs. 

Six minutes and 48 seconds 
into the game, and with it already 
clear who was the stronger team, 
Abizaid took a cross pass from 
Kara Morris, heading the ball in 
for a quick 1-0 lead. 

"It was a fast game," Abizaid 
said. "With all of the shots that 
did not go in, we made the goal-
keeper look good." 

UCSD's Lauren Jacobs extend-
ed her team's lead at the 33:07 
mark with a little help from her 
friends. Teammate Cindy 
Dostalek kicked a pass to Jessica 
Cordova, who tipped it to Jacobs. 
Jacobs then took the ball and 
booted it in for the 2-0 advantage. 

There were numeroU§ other 
shot opportunities. Shots from 
the legs of Triton kickers whizzed 
toward Masters' gals, but UCSD 

couldn't crack the Mustang 
defense, and the half 

ended with the 
home team up 2-
O. 

Despite the 
overwhelming domina-

tion that the Tritons exer-
cised over the Mustangs, 

UCSD still had difficulty scoring. 
The Tritons, with shots going 

all directions and often hitting the 
cross bar, scored only once in the 
second half. 

"We played well," Abizaid 
said. "We just got unlucky." 

At the 63:24 mark, UCSD's Julia 
Cuder accepted a cross pass from 
the right from teammate Melanie 
Gephart. Cuder shot the ball past 
Lindvall to give her team a 3-0 lead. 

"It was not quite the same 
pressure," McManus said, refer-
ring to the previous game that 
was played before a homecoming 
crowd of nearly 1200 spectators. 
"We got our shots, but they're not 
getting in there for us." 

The win further strengthens 
UCSD's playoff situation. 
. "We have our attitude right," 
Abizaid said. "We're ready to 
make up for last year's mistakes. 
It will be an exciting postseason."

"At times we play too much 
soccer." said McManus. "We get 
greedy. We got our shots and are 
playing well and have no injuries." 

The Tritons close out the regu-
lar season today when they host 
United States International 
University at 7 p.m at RIMAe. 

UCSD Runs Into the History Books 
RECORD: Women fInish second, men third while many perfonnances break long-lasting records 
BILL BURGER 
Staff Writer 

I didn't understand how far 6 
and 8 kilometers are, so, from 
campus, I decided to drive my car 
these distances to see how far I 
would get. By the time 1 kilometer 
had gone by, I had already passed 
Rubio's, which is the farthest I 
ever walk from campus. By the 
time 6 kilometers had gone by, I 
was quite far down Genessee 
Avenue, and by the time I reached 
the 8 kilometer mark I was practi-
cally lost (I have a horrible sense of 
direction, but that doesn't change 
the fact that 8 kilometers is a very 
long distance). 

I got bored while driving that 
far, so I can hardly imagine the 
pain of running those distances, 
which is exactly what the cross 
country team does almost every 
weekend, including last weekend 
at the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association (CCAA) 
Championships in Riverside. 

The women, who ran 6 kilome-
ters for the first time all season. 
finished second at the meet with a 

cumulative score of 78 (lowest James Nielson, who won the meet 
being best). Only UC Davis, with a in a time of 25:20.10. This is the sec-

After the meet, Van Arsdale was 
pleased with his team's perfor-

the regional championships com-

"I was really pleased with the 
way [the team] competed," Van 
Arsdale said. "This team has 
tremendous chemistry and that is 
a vital part of the mix." 

The Tritons are now in the 
middle of a three-week layoff 
during which they will prepare 
for the regional championships to 
be held in Newberg, Ore. on Nov. 
13. From there the Tritons will
