A.S. COUNCIL 
TO EASE 

LIMITS ON 
SAFE RIDE 

Councilmembers 
call for return to old 
system. Additional 
money did not 
increase use this year. 

By Matt L'Heureux 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

The A.S. Council's Safe Ride pro-
gram will be undergoing a major 
revamping and publicity campaign 
in the upcoming year, returning to 
a policy that offers unlimited rides 
to registmd students in need of a 
ride heme OIl Friday and Saturday 
nishu. 
. ' Formerly known as Triton Taxi, 
the Safe Ride program has drawn 
criticism from some student leaders 
for its laclc of exposure on campus 
as well as a policy change last year 
that impltmented a punch card for 
riders in an attempt to cut costs by 
limiting use. 

-A lot of people who should 
know about A.S. Safe Ride don't 
know about it; said Revelle College 
Senior Senator Rachel Corell, one 
of the most prominent voices on 
the A.S. Council for reform of the 
service. -In the past, it wasn't adver-
tised to people as much as it could 
have been." 

Revelle sophomore Michael 
Stockin. who first brought concerns 
with the service to the council, 
expressed a similar worry. 

"What concerns me is that I didn't 
even know how to sign up for it," he 
said. 

Newly elected Commissioner of 
Student Services Kaveh Cyrus said 
that, while use of the service has gone 
down in the past year, the number 
of sign-ups has remained at a steady 
average over the three years since the 
program was established. 

"Safe Rides was absolutely poorly 
promoted this year; Cyrus said "The 
materials were in place but nothing 
was done with them." 

Cyrus acknowledged that 
although the quality of the Safe Ride 
service has been the same since it was 
first offered, the failure to adequately 
advertise is in part due to the depar-
ture of previous Commissioner of 
Student Services Maurice Junious, 
who was impeached last quarter. 

"We have been and are looking 
to increase funding to A.S. Safe Ride, 
even if they haven't been promoted 
like they should have been," Cyrus 
said. 

A.S. President Harry Khanna, who 
is currently formulating the council's 
budget, said that the system's usage 
was hurt by the punch-card system

Students At 
Bat to Bail Out 
Athletic Debt 

Fall referendum would 
raise fees to close 
budget of athletics 
department. 

By Serena Renner 
STAFF WRITER 

While Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph W. Watson previously 
pledged to fill the deficit that surfaced 
in the athletics department's operat-
ing budget last year, newly elected 
A.S. Commissioner of Athletics Kari 
Gohd, the Triton Athletic Council 
and the UCSO administration have 
turned to a student fee referendum 
to decide the fate of intercollegiate 
sports teams. 

The operational budget of the ath-
letics department is roughly 5300,000 
in debt this year, according to Watson . 
Although the Student Affairs depart-
ment plans to cover the current deficit 
so that the program can continue to 
function, more revenue is needed for 
a long-term solution or else it will

Movie, music groups 
take aim at college 
local area networks to 
prevent illegal Internet 
downloads. 

By Matthew Leavitt 
CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

Two media associations - the 
Recording Industry Association of 
America and the Motion Picture 
Association of America - have 
recently announced a campaign to 
combat Internet piracy over local 
area networks on college campuses. 

Both industry groups have 
expressed concern over the increase 
of movie and music pirating through 
college LANs. 

Last year, the RIAA sued hun -
dreds of students using peer-to-
peer programs, such as Limewire 
and Poisoned, to illegally download 
media. While P2P networks still 
remain the most popula.r file-sharing 
programs among Internet pirates, 
LAN piracy - through programs 
such as MyTunes or OurTunes -
have become more widespread. 

Tony Wood, director of UCSO's 
Academic Computing Services, said 
that local networks allow more ano-
nymity for users. 

"Unlike the more familiar open 
P2P nrtworks, these private networks 
are not readily discoverable - an

New industry report 
backs guaranteed over 
direct -loan programs. 

By Charles Nguyen 
NEWS EDITOR 

An association of loan lend-
ers say that s.tudent loans offered 
by independent companies are 
cheaper for taxpayers than loans 
distributed directly by the federal 
government. 

The argument - published 
in a study by America's Student 
Loan Providers - attempts to 
debunk findings released earlier 
by the Government Accountability 
Office that endorsed direct loans, 
which compete with those offered 
by private lenders. According to 
the industry study, loans issued by 
Federal Family Education Loans, 
an umbrella program that admin-
isters several borrowing programs 
such as the Parent Plus and federal 
Stafford loans, cost the government 
$7 for every $100 in loans from 
1994 to 2002. By comparison, the 
study found that costs of direct 
loans was $9.16. 

The direct lending program 
was created in 1993, when law-

Campus Team Finds 
Retardation Gene 
Researchers at UCSO's School 

of Medicine have identified a gene 
that causes a malformation in the 
cerebellums pf pediatric patients, 
leading to a form of mental retar-
dation known as a joubert . syn-
drome related disorder. 

The team, in collaboration with 
scientists at Italy's Mendel Inst itute, 
studied an Italian fami ly with sev-
eral individuals that had the dis-
ea e. Within the family, w/:lich was 
made up of two parents who were 
second cousins, researchers locat-
ed a new genetic interval and the 
presence of a gene that encodes a 
protein affecting cerebellum devel· 
opment. 

jSRD is a group of syndromes 
associated with the absence of the 
middle part of the cerebellum. The 
disease also causes poor balance, 
organ damage, jerky eye move-
ments, menta l retardation and 
autism. 

The most prominent characteris· 
tic of jSRD is the "molar tooth Sign," 
so named because the brain bases 
of patients with the disease take on 
the shape of a tooth . 

Stem Cell Conference 
Comes to UCSD 

A free conference called "Social 
justice and Stem Cell Research" 
will be held at UCSD on May 
13 in Center Hall , marking one 
of the biggest publi c gatherings 
fOCUSed on stem cell research 
since the passage of Proposition 
71 in November 2004. 

The conference will feature 
many prominent scientists, includ-
ing cellular and molecular medi-
cine professor Larry Goldstein, 
who was one of the authors of 
Proposition 71 and also testified 
before the U.S. Senate in 1999 
to advocate embryonic stem cell 
research. 

Other speakers include bioen· 
gineer and award-wi nning author 
Wesley Smith, UCSD socio logy 
professor and bioethics expert 
fohn Eva ns and University of 
Wisconsi n law and bioethi cs pro-
fessor Alta Charo. 

Freshmen at High 
Risk for Chlamydia 
Freshmen under the age of 

20 at several colleges across the 
southeastern United States had a 
70 percent greater risk of devel· 
oping chlamydia infections than 
students who were between 20 
and 24 years of age, according 
to an Emory University School of 
Medicine study. 

The study featured screenings 
of 789 students at health centers in 
10 colleges in Alabama, Georgia 
and Mississippi. 

Because many of the colleges 
in the study are historica lly black, 
the majority of students screened 
were black, and more than half of 
the students tested were female. 

The study was conducted to 
determine whether freshmen were 
entering college with chlamydia or 
becoming infected while in col· 
lege, and the next step will involve 
introducing more chlamydia 
awareness outreach programs.

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL 
NOW THEY DON'T LIKE 

M.Y CIA PICK? DON'T 
PEOPLE KNOW HOW 

MUCH RESEARCH I PUT 
INTO THESE THINGS? 

By Riley Salant-Pearce 

Hey, Employers! We're Young, We're 
Smart and We're Not Afraid to Lie 

As someone with few mar-ketable skills and the work ethic of a senile .gorilla, this 
time of year (the job huntin' sea-

schemes? No problem! Just say on 
your resume (or at your interview) 
that you're a brave leader with lots 
of ideas and the determination to

son) is horribly 
depressing. It's 
made me realize 
that 11) finding 
a job I love, as 
everyone advises 
I do, is damn 
near impossible, 
unless ·cham-

mmadden@ucsd.edu tacy and an extra-
hefty rea stapler 

you can fling at the wall whenever 
someone crosses you. 

pion sleeper; "indomitable beer 
drinker" or "foxy bitch" morph into 
careers; and 2) writing resumes and 
cover letters are wonderful exercises 
in creativity. 

Resumes are about lying by omis-
sion. No one's perfect, bilt resumes 
are designed to make us look so; 
therefore, they end up about as sin-
cere as Donald Rumsfeld. Does a 
human resources drone for a mar-
keting company want to hear about 
your stint at Taco Bell? No, and all 
the better, because you got fired 
after dipping your face into the salsa 
on a dare. See? You just excised that 
from your resume, which makes you 
a liar, you face·dipper. 

Of course, when you actually do 
lie on your resume, you're in deep 
yogurt (or salsa) . 

A few years ago, UCSD had a 
megalomaniac poetry professor 
named Quincy Troupe, who fell 
from grace when it was discovered 
he had not actually earned a bach-
elor's degree, as his resume claimed. 
It seems odd that the wizards at 
UCSD had never checked with his 
alma mater when they hired him. 

Or, try this scenario. You lpent 
college blowing your parenti' 
money, hitting on your suitemate 
and cheating on exams. 

What you say on your resume? 
Easy! You're friendly, outgoing, 
excellent at securing sponsors and 
good at finding the most efficient 
way to achieve your goals. 

Here's a harder one: Let's say . 

~umes are about 
tying by omission. 

No one's 'perfect, but 
resumes are designed 
to make us look SO; 
therefore, they end 

up about as sincere as . 
Donald Rumsfeld." 

, ' 

But to be fair, hIs resume was writ- you're a borderline moron with no 
ten in dazzlilllly perfect iambic direction; in other words, a com-
pentameter, and we all know that munication major. How do You Ipin 
poetic flair automaticilly increases that? Just say you're excellent at 
anYone's credibility. t~g directions, and working on

Article Overlooks 
Kendo Team B 

Dear Editor, 
I would like to provide some 

more information and clarifications 
in regards to your May 1 article in the 
Sports section, titled, "Kendo Team 
Fights Way to Second." The UCSD 
kendo team sent two squads to the 

. Harvard Shoryuhai "Tournament, 
and both teams made it to the semi-
finals, where Team A and Team B 
were subsequently matched against 
each other. Team A went on to take 
second place, but Team B demon-
strated its akilla, barely losinl to the 
A team. Team 8, which was made 
up mainly of students wbo started 
kendo at UCSD, took third place, 
defeating many all-black beh teams. 
Matthew Schultze!, Brian Lee, Tab 

Yamasaki and Tam Hoang should be 
commended for their efforts. 

The UCSD ken do team is also 
indebted to many organizations and 
UCSD ~artments that helped sup-
port our event. All of the six col-
lele councils, as well as ASUCSD, 
Cbancellor Fox and Princeton 
Review IUpported the team. Without 
them and the efforts of RIMAC, 
SOLO, and Revelle College Senior 
Senator Rachel Corell, UCSD might 
not have been able to compete this 
year.

Student Funds Only Way' to 
BailOut Dept., Watson Says 
• ATHLETICS, from page 1 
have to be condensed, Watson said. 

"UCSD athletics have been 
underfunded [from the start]; 
Watson said. "The hope was that 
they could contain expenditures and 
increase gift funding but it is clear 
that we were too optimistic." 

Since fundraising efforts have 
thus far proved fruitless, Gohd, 
rAC and the athletics department 
are resorting to an old approach 
- increasing student fees - to pick 
up the slack in the budget. 

The A.S. Council plans to carry 
out a fee referendum in which stu-
dents could vote on whether to raise 
the existing intercollegiate athletics 
fee . 

"The people who work in the 
athletics department are incredibly 
stretched and don't have time to 
fundraise in addition to doing their 
jobs; Gohd said. "If the administra-
tion won't [spend more money], the 
students have to." 

Thrning to students for money 
has been a common trend, even 
in other universities, Watson said. 
While some big-time sports schools 
rely more on their fan base for 
revenue, the UCSD athletic sports 
schools has relied on registration 
fees and the special ICA . fee since 
its inception, It is up to students 
to decide what they want to fund, 
according to Watson. 

"[Student fees] are the only secure 
option to raise funds for a depart-
ment'" Watson said. "You can't run 
a program on the hope for revenue 
or anticipated gift funding when you 
haven't raised [anyl to date." 

Although Gohd, TAC, the athlet-
ics department and other supporters 
are optimistic about the outcome 
of such a vote, some question the 
legitimacy of charging students to 
stabilize a debt that they had little 
to do with . 

While raising the athletics fee 
could be an option. students could 
also vote to reduce the program. 
according to Watson. 

"Athletics can contribute to the 
vitality of student life; Watson said. 
·Unfortunately. the decision rests 
with the.students. That's just the way 
we do it here at UCSD." 

TAC co-Chair Dan Noel said he 
believes that insufficient funding 
itself could cause students to vote 
against the referendum; however. 
h,e thinks their perceptions are mis-
guided. 

"People are currently unsatisfied 
but if you look at the enOrmous 
success given the current bud-
get. the possibilities are unlimited 
with a budget comparable to other 
Division-II schools." Noel said. 

The fee would allow sports teams 
to compete at a higher level and 
improve the campus social climate. 
according to Noel. The department 
and its athletes are working as hard 

. as they can; students need to take a 
step forward to match that effort, 
Noel said. 

"If increased school spirit and an 
improved social atmosphere really 
mean something to students, the 
money really isn't that big of a deal." 
Noel said. "What athletics could do 
for this scbool is worth the money." 

The student fee referendum is 
intended for next fall and it could 
occur in conjunction with the 
grants-in -aid proposal, which the 
Academic Senate endorsed as long . 
as students are willing to pay for it. 

"The referendum is in the hands 
of the students and the outcome 
is in the hands of the students; 
Watson said. "Students have been 
supportive thus far and we're ask-
ing them '0 strengthen their lnoel 
of support." 

A program review of the struc-
ture of the atbletic department 
budget is currently underway. The 
results, which will be released this 
month, should provide more clues 
about a long-term solution for the 
budget crisis.

A.S. Hires 
More Vans 

for Sun God 
• RIDE, from page 1 
and not by lackluster advertising. 

Cyrus said that he is currently in 
the process of renegotiating the con· 
tract with Cloud 9 Shuttle, the com· 
pany that provides the vans and drivers 
for the service. 

Along with the potential of more 
funding, he hopes to eventually set 
up easier methods for students to reg· 
ister for the service itself. Presently, 
a student may only sign up for the 
Safe Ride program by visiting the A.S. 
Council offices on the third floor of 
Price Center. 

The difficulty of obtairiing the card 
was another student concern, prompt-
ing Corell to take an informal survey 
of how many student leaders on the 
COWlCiI had registered for the service. 

*You think these students would 
be the most likely to have one~ Corell 
said. 

However, the vast majority of the 
students she spoke to either did not 
have a Safe Ride card or were unaware 
of the program's existence. 

According to Corell there are plans 
in the works to improve Safe Ride's 
publicity, including making it a part of 
·Wdcome Week" for next fall . 

She also hopes to get the word out 
to resident advisers and orientation 
leaders in order to ensure that every 
student wishing 10 use the program 
is aware of how to obtain a Safe Ride 
card. 

Along those lines, Cyrus' office has 
hired five eXtra vans for the Sun God 
festival on May 12, bringing the total 
to nine for the event.

Study Disputes 
Government 

Findings 
• L~S, from page 1 
makers sought an alternative to 
guaranteed loans, through which 
banks and private lenders offer 
loans to students and parents that 
are subsidized by the U.S. govern· 
ment. Because direct loans cut out 
middlemen, private lenders have 
been battling the program to keep 
their own businesses aflaat. 

ASLP's report attacked federal 
information that showed dlnict lend-
ing to be cheaper than guaranteed 
loans. The difference can be explained 
by tax revenues, not included in the 
government's numbers, from the two 
programs, and government estimates 
based on overly optimistic projec-
tions of future interest rates, accord-
ing to ASLP Executive Director Kevin 
Bruns .• 

·Sadly, [FFEL hasl become a par-
tisan punching bag. almost entirely 
because of the erroneous impression 
left by government cost estimates." he 
stated in a press release. *The truth 
is that guaranteed student loana are a

their music. This author prefers 
"mainstream-o," anyway.) Unlike their 
cohorts, they stick to the rules of pop 
music, crafting their songs to appeal 
to modern rock radio listeners and 
the high school loners that go straight 
home to Total Request Live instead 
of footbalVcheerleading practice. The 
band's pop savvy definitely shows, as 
in the impossibly catchy and hilari· 
ous - once you forget its ubiquity 
- single/video for ''I'm Not Okay (J 
Promise)." 

In 2002, they released their 
debut, You Brought Me Your Bullets. 
f Brought You My Love, a medio-
cre but melodramatic album that. 
despite minor chord theatrics and 
original song titles (like "Honey. This 
Mirror [sn't Big Enough For the Two 
of Us" and ·Vampires Wi/J Never 
Hurt You·), did little to distinguish 
them from the small crowd of pop 
and not-so-pop screamo acts like 
Thursday, Thrice and the Used.

arrived. complete with future singles 
"I'm Not Okay (I Promise)." "Helena" 
and "The Ghost of You; and the rest 
is histo - er, now. With Thru Cheers. 
My Chemical Romance tossed aside 
the epic five-plus-minute. song 
lengths of their debut. electing for 
the radio-ready three-minute rock-
ers, chock full of multilayered vocal 
harmonies and shout -along chorus· 
es. They combined their speedy hor-
ror-punk with a bleeding heart and 
bleeding wrists. as if Morrissey wrote 
a song to impress Glenn Danzig of 
the Misfits, but all under the thumb 
of their major label. 

Still obsessed with death and 
failed romance, the band brought 
their mainstream-o sound and Way's 
ghoulish appearance to the once-
revered halls of MTV. where they 
cried at funerals. died at Normandy 
and were picked on by bullies in the 
cafeteria. Their fast 'n' heavy riffs 
easily found an audience - ''I'm

even won 2005's best artist and best 
breakout artist awards from MTVU 
and Playboy, respectively. 

Since the success of Three Cheers. 
My Chemical Romance has moved 
beyond touring with small-fry ex-
peers like the Used and Taking Back 
Sunday, instead acting as support for 
Green Day's American [diot tour (so 
that's where they got those outfits!) 
and headlining their own shows, 
culminating in the recent Life on 
the Murder Scene, a collection of 
live tracks and music videos. They 
also idolize Queen. and recorded 
an iTunes.only cover of 'Under 
Pressure" with the Used. I just hope 
they play it Friday night.

Mr. Nogatco a.k.a. Kool Keith 
• Mogateo Rd. 
INSOMNIAC INC. 

*** As hip-hop's original role-player, Kool Keith free -flowed pervert-ed bathroom raps and battled 
alter-egos long before weird-hop was 
hip and Doom donned his villainous 
mask. Keith's most notorious charac-
ter was 19%'s Dr. Octagon, the extra-
terrestrial gynecologist who traveled 
through time and lifted skirts to Dan 
the Automator's galactic beat. Now, 
after a few years of fooling around 
with a "Black Elvis" rubber wig, Keith 
has revealed Mr. Nogatco. 

Nogatco operates on alien brains 
down a deliciously slimy alleyway 
called Nogatco Rd. (Dr. Octagon 
backward) - not that this is apparent 
beyond the cover art. The dismissal 
of plot saves Nogatco from becom-
ing just a failed counterpart to the 
perfectly formulated Octagon, and 
its lazy, retro sci·fi develops oddly 
human characteristics. When pro-
ducer Iz-Real (behind MF Doom's

coats dialogue - Keith is hypnotized 
into spilling the bizarre fetishes of 
half-sleep. "As a child growing up, 
collecting marbles and roaches I 
Little insects' was my pets I Lightnin' 
bugs under my sneakas I Scrape 
on the concrete, the green streaks:' 
Nogatco hisses on "Alpha Omega." 
continuing with tales of elevator 
shafts, mink bras and lab rats. 

Keith is currently wor~ing on 
several other projects, including the 
official Return of Doctor Octagon, 
and thu~ allows the devilish Nogacto 
to do whatever he pleases - his 
mind's unfocused wanderings hold 
all the joy of dipping one's fingers 
in sparkly grade-school goo, but not 
much more. Sage Francis and Sole 
make cameos to confess that Anticon 
guys have robot fantasies too, spill-
ing their guts to the godfather of 
weird. "I'm more space than you;' 
Keith informs his many imitators 
on "Night Flyer" - and with this I 
must agree.

• Love Made Me Drunk 
SEEDLING 

***~ Stop for a minute. Conjure up whatever images you can of , Paris in the I 920s and '30s. Now 
imagine that it is springtime, just 
like it is here, and a dapper gentle-
man, humbly observant and over-
whelmed by the comings and goings 
of love, is out for a stroll, just like 
you might like to be. Slide in San 
Diego-based musician, songwriter 
and producer Gregory Page's newest 
album, Love Made Me Drunk. and 
you're almost there. 

Birthed from a brief. but passion-
ate affair between traveling musi-
cians, Page first met Paris when he 
first met his father seven years ago. 
Three visits and a couple accordions 
later he's delivered the senses and 
sounds of the city across the Atlantic 
with exceptional eloquence. 

Delicate percussion, plodding 
baselines and poignant harmonies 
- the violins so sorrowful at times 
that you can feel them resonating 
with your heart strings - combined 
with Page's versatile voice - a jazzy, 
folley laze and scratch to it - make 

the musicality on this one hard to 
beat. And somehow, as the cof-
fee-soaked, stress-filled, ever-rush· 
ing, never-sleeping weeks roll by, 
these slow, romantic, French-style 
arrangements translate perfectly in 
the quick minds of many a left-
brained college student. Maybe it's 
because after a long night of love-
driven drinking, Page tragicomical-
ly compares cough syrup to a "fancy 
liqueur; or because he, though 43, 
is still single, still searching, just like 
most of us, or just because the songs 
are so damn beautiful. In any case, 
this album is a welcome cue to settle 
back, relax and sip on something 
that slows the pace once in a while 
- and [ don't mean cozy up with a 
bottle of high quality dextrometho-
rphan; sip on love. 

You needn't go to Paris to learn to 
appreciate the fmer things. Gregory 
Page has done it for you.

Feeling Emo At 
Sun God? 

Why Don't You 
Cry About h? 

My Chemical Romance are head-lining Sun God. When [ heard the news, I didn't shrug with the 
usual, breezy SoCaI apathy - unless 
you can call dry heaving into a sand-
wich bag a shrug. But ni like to imag-
ine that My Chemical Romance fans 
were dry heaving as violently with joy 
as I had chundered with abject horror. 
There's something polarizing about the 

Don't Forget 
the Joker 

CODY B. 

"edgy" radio darlings; it inspires the 
kind ofire and adoration among UCSD 
students that the KhannaIWatts rivalry 
could only hope to achieve. If students 
could vote on whether or not to keep 
them as a headliner, there would surely 
be more than 17.3 percent of students 
voting in that election. 

Compared to My Chemical 
Romance, the other acts at the top 
of the lineup don't inspire nearly as 
much venom, even from the ignorant 
shitbags - yeah, shitbags - that hate 
all hip-hop, including the old Latino 
variety. Why is that, exactly? 

Is it because we think that we're too 
grown up to pay upwards of SSOK to 
see a band that our 12-year-old sister 
would give up her toe for? [s it because 
we like to pretend that were more 
culturally advanced than the standard 
MTV boob who prefers spoon-fed 
pop-trash to actual fucking rock 'n' 
roll? Is it because they just plain suck? 
While every fiber of my being screams, 
"Yes! Yes! Yes!" there's more to it than 
that. 

Liking terrible music is, to most 
people, a matter of their own unique 
(ill-informed) tastes. But mocking pop 
music won't change peoples' opinions, 
and it's hardly my concern when it 
comes to UCSD's epic Sun God festi-
val. I'm not worried about how good 
the music is at the Sun God concert 
- all [ want is some music that [ can 
party along with. 

Which is exactly my problem with 
My Chemical Romance. Regardless of 
how many people like them (there are 
at least 350 on Facebook), they make 
the kind of music that you play when 
you're feeling shitty. They sing about 
being alone, being rejected, falling out 
of love - all things nt like to forget 
on the one day of UCSD·sanctioned 
debauchery. J certainly don't need to be 
reminded of how lonely [ am on Sun 
God - that's what the other 364 days 
of the year are for. 

I understand the difficult job of 
the A.S. programming office: Trying 
to p1ease as many students as possible 
while facing the brick wall of classic 
UCSD apathy. But I'm not complain-
ing because they picked a band 1 don't 
like - the progrunming office should 
ignore such selfish bitching - I'm 
comp1aining because they picked the 
wrong band to host a party. Festivals 
like Fa1lFest and WinterFest are the 
perfect place to put bands that play 
oppressively sad, angry and melodra-
matic music, but inviting them to the 
24th-annual Sun God displays com-
plete ignorance of the festival's spirit. 

UCSD's student body is often chid-
ed for its constant apathy and reserva-
tion, but that shit goes straight out the 
window come Sun God. It's the one 
day of the year that people meet one 
another, talk to new people, act crazy 
and get drunk together - things that 
I'm sure will not be encouraged by 
Romance's violent melancholy. 

That said, nearly all of the other 
acts of Sun God - Lyrics Born, Talib 
Kweli and Cypress Hill especially -
are perfect for the schoolwide bender. 
But the depressing emo-pop of My 
Chemical Shltpants? [ thought we 
were trying to have a party here.

Underrated 
Kweli Back On 

Campus ~r Sun God 
~ ICWELI, from page 10 
for which suggested that Kweli was 
poised to become underground 
hip-hop's new commercial phenom-
enon. 

Mostwhosaw Kweli at WinterFest 
two years back probably predicted 
he'd be headlining shows like Sun 
God by now. But, as Jay-Z noted, 
skills don't equal sales, and Kweli's 
second solo album simultaneously 
managed to sink commercially and 
alienate some of his backpack-rap 
base for being "too mainstream." In 
reality, 200s's Beautiful Struggle was 
a solid set characterized by clever 
beats and sharp lyricS. Ultimately, 
though, the production - which 
ranged from Hi-Tek to West to the 
Neptunes - caused the album to 
settle somewhere between under-
ground hlp-hop and mainstream 
rap in an awkward, MTV2 sort of 
way. It didn't help that the lead sin-

g�e' the West-produced "I Try," was 
essentially a rehash of "Just to Get 
By" dulled down with a lackluster 
Mary J. Blige hook. 

"Iflyrics sold, then truth be told 
I I'd probably be just as rich and 
famous as Jay-Z' replies Kweli on 
the Beautiful Struggle. He's selling 
himself short, of course, and Friday 
night we'll get a second chance to 
decide whether Kweli's inarguably 
awesome lyrics are paired with 
enough skill to continue his upward 
momentum past the likes of charis-
matic Mos Def (or the prehistoric 
Cypress Hill) toward the success 
- and the festival bookings - he 
deserves. 

Students, lap it up while you 
can, because someday you're going 
to have to start paying for Kweli's 
shows and stop calling him -under-
ground" hip-hop.
