The Decline of Student 
ActiviSlll--Part II 

STUDENT ACTIVITY CENTER, shown here at end of 
quarter, is ~Imost completed. Details Page 2. 

Toward the Rebirth of 
UCSD Student Government 

by Rick Drom Star, expressed some mixed emotions . 
" I want to wait and see about the 
participants' real committment. It is 
two different things to attend a con· ' 
ference and to actually accomplish 
something lasting . 

by John Taylor 

Every month , a thick, 
yellow envelope is routinely 
dumped at the Triton Times 
office by a campus 
mailman. In it are materials 
pertaining to that month's 
Regent's meeting. 

A subeditor is assigned to 
wade through the contents-
reports from committees on 
Finance, on the Budget, on 
Building-in the event they 
should include something 
interesting, or even 
something printable. It is 
rarely found that they do. 

And if the mood of 
UCSD's newspaper is at all 
indiutive of the temper of 
the school, a comparison 
we h~ve made and found 
true, at least .for the past 
five years, interest in the 
activities of the life-giving 
Regents has decreased, or 
dis~ppeared, from the mass 
of students here. 

Interest in the Regents 
reached an apparent peak 
in the 1968-1969 school 
year. That year is the 
subject of the following-
the second in a four-part 

series on activism , and the 
eventual lack of it- with 
emphasis on the Regents 
and reaction to them on the 
UC campuses. 

• * • 

Sept mber, 1969 MUIr 
College (sans Tioga Hall ) 
was fini hed , the M dical 
School was almost finis hed, 
the library was un d r 
const>uction UCSD was 
still growing 

And the sc hool , after a 
year of complaints and 
demonstrations, had finally 
found a food serving system 
that eemed to meet with 
the approval of those who 
had spoken for The Cause 
the year before. UCSD was 
ready to tackle issues that 
were, just po sibly, more 
important than cafeterias . 

UCSD students got their 
first taste of what was to 
come when Eldridge 
Cleaver , then Black Panther 
Minister of Information, 
spoke to a capacity crowd 
in the newly-built, as yet 
uninitiated UCSD gym . 
Chancellor McGill (al 0 a 
new addition , also 

uninitiated) allowed TNC, 
student .organization, to 
handle security for the 
assemblage, a nd banned 
policemen from the area . 
(There were , however, a 
numb r of unlforme 
g ntl men stationed 
nearby) Despite the 
presence of Y AF picket, 
there were no phYSical 
confrontations , althoug 
Cleaver's requests fo r 
"power to the peopl " an 
hi Ronald Reagan chee 
did little to alleViate ten-
sion . 

We mention Cleaver, 
however, because he 
played a role in one of the 
major disputes of the year . 
the Regent's un precedent 
self-involvement in th 
academic affairs of th 
univerSity . In fact , critics 0 
the Governor and th 
Regents claimed that the 
hadn 't had the least Interest 
in curricula until Eldridge 
Cleaver was invited t 
lecture in Social Analysi 
139X at Berkeley, a cours 
designed by a student grou 

continued on pag 2 

Last week~nd 70 UCSD students 
helped to conceive a new entity on 
campus : elf government . Though still 
far from delivery, this concept is 
growing each day . 

The conference last week~nd was 
held all day Saturday and Sunday in the 
International Center . It 's theme was 
"Bureaucracy and How to Get Around 
It", but its message was deeper . The 
conference marked a re-birth of student 
interest in organizing talents and 
energy toward common goals . 

"I really think that some ort of 
participatory student government 
needs to be formed . I hope that this 
conferen ce was the initial com 
mittment to that goaL" 

The Third College Assistant Dean, 
Beverly Varga also attended . She 
reflected that, "On the whole I was 
really pleased with it. I am e pecially 
excited by the stud nt coalition and 
what it could do to help people who are 
usually ignored ." 

SECDO Attempts to Expand 
Curriculum Through Prof. Survey 

For the first time in UCSD's history, 
members of almost every student 
organization got together to plan their 
common future . 

This meeting, which lasted over 18 
hours, began with a discussion of The 
Student and his role in the University . 
Fol lowin g discussions included 
"Bureaucracies - How they Function"; 
"Mixing Activisim with Academia"; and 
"Funding Sources and How to get at 
Them". 

In eac h seSSI<.ln much information , 
totalling over 80 pages, was handed out 
and discussed among the participants. 
But the most important results were 
probably obtained during the breaks 
between sessions . 

Diverse groups on campus, who had 
previously ignored each other, began to 
talk . Groups which previously had only 
pursued their own goals began to 
cdnsider larger common goals . 

Watching the conference there 
appeared to be a breaking of traditional 
barriers betY(een colleges, ethnic 
groups and interest groups . This 
phenomenon could be felt by most who 
attended and impressed almost all of 

~em . . 
Cheryll Garriot, a member of the 

Black Student Union commented, "This 
conference was right on! It was very 
productive in that people shared ideas 
and concepts. They interacted and 
related to each other. I think that it also 
gave people a new look at Third College 
as welL" 

Another partic ipant was Ellen 
Wilson, the chairperson of CAlPIRG . 
Commenting on the conference she 
said, "I really enjoyed it. The con· 
ference was ~ good way to meet active 
students on campus. I hope that a 
strong coalition of ~tudent interests will 
come out of the wed.~ ·' 

Doug Ballis, a writer for the North 

Ian Boase, organizer of the Students' 
Educational Change af'd Development 
Center had this to say about the 
conference and what it meant. " It was 
really excellent. Though I had initial 
reservations, I feel that we got muc h 
accomplished; the information that was 
presented was really beneficial. 

"I have been at UCSD for 5 years ana 
this is the first time that I have ever 
seen 70 students, from diverse groups, 
all get together." 

Much of the credit for organizing the 
conference belongs to The Un-
dergraduate Student Council, (l .U.S.c.) 
who sponsored it. Stephanie Harris , the 
Chairperson ; Margery Bennett, the 
secretary and Mark Bookman, the. new 
University Center director, worked hard 
with many other stud~nts to pull if off . 

Bookman felt that the conference 
served the three purposes for which it 
had been designed. It gave the students 
who attended the skills necessary to 
help themselves . Also it showed each of 
the participants the wide variety of 
skills which UCSD students already 
have. Finally it gave students from all 3 
colleges a chance to talk together and 
meet one another . 

by Bette Garrett . 

Expanding the UCSD 
curriculum is the long-range 
goal of a campus-wide 
survey of .professors to be 
conducted this quarter by 
the Student Educational 
Change and Development 
Center, a student-run 
resource group devoted to 
educational c hange here . 
Via questionnaire , in -
structors will outline their 
specia l interests in teaching 
and potentially make 
themselves available as 
advisors and teachers for 
new courses on campus . 

The survey is part of a 
continuing effort by the 
Center to co llect and 
provide a pool of in-
formation on courses, 
instructors , resources and 
procedures at UCSD. 

lincoln Cushing, a UCSD 
student and coordinator of 
the Center, described the 
current project as "one step 
in changing the University 
structure" and explained 
that the new information 
will help his group coor-
dinate students seeking 
curriculum changes with 
professors willing to 

In fact , the only minor disap- sponsor or teach new 
pointment, according to Bookman, was . courses .. 
that the participation from Revelle was Cushing said fu~1 
not a) large as he had hoped. response to the survey I 

expected by the t'nd of the 
quarter . At the conference the seed for a 

student coalition to work on common 
goal was sown But the larger question 
remains to be answerE'd "Will thi 
intt>rf'''t continue afer thf' conferen f'?" 

One of tht' fir t ucce t' 
In the our e -initlation 
effort was la t sprint{ 
lower dlvi~ion ourse In 

wilderness, offered as 
Interdisciplinary 20 The 
course began as a student 
brainstorm and was evolved 
througt'- students in a 
Directed Study Group 
course in the fall of 1972. 
With the help of Muir 
College Provost John 
Stewart and Lola Ros , who 
acted as faculty advisors, 
the idea blossomed into a 
new class offered in the 
Spring Quarter. 

Cushing said that thiS 
kind of curricul um ex-
pansion will be promoted 
by the information 
col lected during this 
quarter ' s survey of 
prote sor . 

The Center's be t-known 
project is the continuing 
Course and Profe sor 
Evaluation (rAPE) wh ich 
calls upon tudent each 
quarter to evaluate their 
classes in a vari ty of 
categories, from "teaching 
effectivenes " to 
possibilit ies for im -
provement. 

CAPE was created to 
provide a ba is of fa t to 
support student effort to 
c hange the curricul urn . 
"Nobody here i really 
getting what they want," 
Cushing said , ' and he 
believes that no one an a k 
for power to make changE' 
wirh,out legitimate In-
formation to ba k up their 
Idt'a.

and In tructor and assigns 
letter grades to each 
category For example, a 
professor may merit an A- in 
"enthUSiasm in course" and 
a C in "accessibilit out ide 
of cia ." 

In their report, CAPE's 
coordinators also sum 
marize the students' written 
comments in a brief note t 
upplement the data . 

"Many tudents consldere 
this a valuable learning 
experience," the pring '73 
report conclude , or "the 
text i terrible, and probably 
hould be replaced ." 

Last pring's evaluation 
are to appear on campu

those from the current 
session will be publi hed

STUDENT ACTIVITY CENTER, shown here at end of 
quarter, is almost completed. Details Page 2. 

Toward the Rebirth of 
UCSD Student Government 

by Rick Drom 

Last week-€nd 70 UCSD students 
helped to conceive a new entity on 
campus : se lf government . Though still 
far from delivery, this concept is 
growing each day . 

The conference last wee k-€nd was 
held all day Saturday and Sunday in the 
Internat ional Center . It's theme was 
"Bureaucracy and How to Get Around 
It", but its message was deeper. The 
conference marked a re-birth of student 
inte rest in organizing talents and 
ene rgy toward common goals . 

Fo r the first time in UCSD's history, 
members of almost every student 
organ ization got together to plan their 
common future . 

This meeting, which lasted over 18 
hours, began with a discussion of The 
Student and his role in the University . 
Fo llowing disc ussions included 
"Bureaucracies - How they Function"; 
"Mixing Activisim with Academia"; and 
"Funding Sources and How to get at 
Them". 

In each seSSl<.ln much· information , 
totalling over 80 pages , was handed out 
and discussed among the participants . 
But the most important results were 
probably obtained during the breaks 
between sessions . 

Diverse groups on campus, who had 
previously ignored each other, began to 
talk. Groups which previously had only 
pursued their own goals began to 
cdnsider larger common goals. 

Watching the c onference there 
appeared to be a breaking of traditional 
barriers bet"leen colleges, ethnic 
groups and interest groups. This 
phenomenon could be felt by most wllo 
attended and impressed almost all of 
them . 

Cheryll Carriot, a member of the 
Black Student Union commented, "This 
conference was right onl It was very 
productive in that people shared ideas 
and concepts . They interacted and 
related to each other . I think that it also 
gave people a new look at Th ird College 
as well ." 

Another participant was Ellen 
Wilson, the chairperson of CALPIRC. 
Commentina on the conference she 
said, "I really enjoyed it . The con-
ference was a good way to meet active 
students on campus . I hope that a 
strong coalition of student interests Will 
come out of the wet:"~" 

Doua Ballis, a writer for the North 

Star, expressed some mixed emotions. 
" I want to wait and see about the 
partici pants' real committment. It is 
two different things to attend a con· ' 
fe rence and to actually accomplish 
something lasting . 

"I really th ink that some ort of 
part ici patory student go ve rnme nt 
needs to be formed . I hope that this 
conference was the initi a l com 
mittment to that goal." 

The Third College Assi sta nt Dean, 
Beverly Varga also attended . She 
reflected that , "On the whole I was 
really pleased with it. I am especia ll y 
excited by the student coalition and 
what it could do to help people who are 
usually ignored ." 

Ian Boase, organizer of the Students' 
Educational Change and Develo pment 
Center had this to say about the 
conference and what it meant. " It was 
really excellent . Though I had initial 
reservations, I feel that we got much 
accomplished ; the information that was 
presented was really beneficial. 

"I have been at UCSD for 5 years ano 
this is the first time that I have ever 
seen 70 students , from diverse groups, 
all get together." 

Much of the credit for organi zi ng the 
conference belongs to Th e Un· 
dergraduate Student Council, (T .U.S.c.) 
who sponsored it . Stephanie Harris, the 
Chairperson; Margery Bennett, the 
secretary and Mark Bookman , the new 
University Center director, worked harrl 
with many other stud~nts to pull if off. 

Bookman felt that the conference 
served the three purposes for which it 
had been designed . It gave the students 
who attended the skills necessary to 
help themselves. Also it showed each of 
the participants the wide variety of 
skills which UCSD students already 
have . Finally it gavt! students from all 3 
colleges a chance to talk together and 
meet one another . 

In fact , the only minor disap-
pointment, according to Bookman, was 
that the participation from Revelle was 
not c)) 'large as he had hoped. 

At the conference the seed for a 
student coalition to work on common 
goals was sown But the larger question 
remains to be answerfOd "Will this 

int~r~~t continue afer ~h~ conferencf'f" 

The Decline of Student 
Activism--Part II 

by John Taylor 

Every month , a thick, 
yellow envelope is routinely 
dumped at the Triton Times 
office by a campus 
mailman. In it are materials 
pertaining to that month's 
Regent's meeting. 

A subeditor is assigned to 
wade through the contents-
reports from committees on 
Finance, on the Budget, on 
Building- in the event they 
should include something 
interesting, or even 
something printable. It is 
rarely found that they do . 

And if the mood of 
UCSO's newspaper is at all 
indicative 01 the temper of 
the school, a comparison 
we have made and found 
true, at least .for the past 
live years, interest in the 
activities of the life-giving 
Regents has decreased, or 
diS41ppeared, from the mass 
01 students here. 

Interest in the Regents 
reached an apparent peale 
in the 1968-1969 school 
year. That year is the 
subject 01 the following -
the second in a four·part 

series on activism, and the 
eventual lack of it- with 
emphasis on the Regents 
and reaction to them on the 
UC campuses. 

... 

September, 1969 Muir 
College (sans Tioga Hall ) 
was finish d , the Medica l 
School was almost fin ished, 
the library wa s unde r 
constJuction UCSD was 
still growin g 

And the school, after a 
year of omplalnt sand 
demonstr atlons, had fi nally 
found a food serving system 
that seemed to meet with 
the approval of those who 
had spoken for The Cause 
the year before UCSD was 
ready to tackle issues that 
were, just possibly, more 
important than cafeterias. 

UCSD students got their 
fi rst taste of what was to 
come wh e n Eldridge 
Cleaver t then Black Panther 
Minister of Information, 
spoke to a capacity crowd 
in the newly-built, as yet 
uninitiated UCSD gym . 
Chancellor McGill (also a 
new addit io n , also 

uninitiated) allowed TNC, 
student .organlzation , to 
handle security for the 
as emblage, and banned 
policemen from the area 
(Th r were , however, a 
number of undorme 
gent lemen s tationed 
nearby) Desp ite the 
presence of YAr pickets, 
there were no physica 
confro ntattons, althoug 
Cleaver's requests for 
"power to the people" an 
hi Ronald Reagan c hee 
dtd little to alleviate ten· 
sion . 

We mention Cleaver, 
however , because he 
played a role in one of the 
major disputes of the year ' 
the Regent's unprecedent 
self-involvement in th 
academic affairs of th 
university . In fact , c ritics 0 
the Governor and th 
Regents claimed that the 
hadn ' t had the least interest 
in curricula until Eldridge 
Cleaver was invited t 
lecture in Social Analysi 
139X at Berkeley, a cours 
designed by a student grou

SECDO Attempts to Expand 
Curriculum Through Prof. Survey 

by Bette Garrett · 

Expanding the UCSD 
curriculum is the lo ng-range 
goa l of a campus-wide 
survey of ,professors to be 
conducted this quarter by 
the Student Educational 
Change and Development 
Center , a s tudent-run 
resource group devoted to 
educational change here . 
Via questionnaire , in-
struc tors will outline their 
special interests in teaching 
and potentially make 
them selves availabl e as 
advisors and teachers for 
new COLirses on campus. 

The survey is part of a 
continuing effort by the 
Center to collect and 
provide a pool of in-
form ation on c ourses, 
instructors, resources and 
procedures at UCSD. 

Lincoln Cushing, a UCSD 
student and coordinator of 
the Center, described the 
current project as "one step 
in changing the University 
structure" and explained 
that the new information 
will help his group coor-
dinate students seeking 
curriculum changes with 
professors willing to 
sponsor or teac h new 
courses. 

Cushing said full 
response to the survey is 
expected by the end of the 
quarter . 

One of the first ucces e 
in the ourse -Initiation 
effort was la t prinK' 
10wer -divl)IOn course in 

wilderness, offered as 
Interdiscip linary 20. The 
course began as a tudent 
bra instorm and was evo lved 
througr students ina 
Dire cted Study Group 
course in the fa ll of 1972. 
With the help of Muir 
College Provost Jo hn 
Stewart and Lola Ross , who 
acted as faculty advisors, 
the idea blossomed in to a 
new class offered in the 
Spn ng Quarter. 

Cu hing said that this 
kind of c urriculum ex-
pansion will be promoted 
by th e information 
co ll ected dur ing this 
quar ter 's urvey of 
professors . 

The Center's best-known 
project is the continu ing 
Course and Profe sso r 
Evaluation (C APE) wh ich 
calls upon tudent each 
quarter to evaluate their 
classes in a variety of 
categories, from "teach ing 
effectiveness " to 
possibilit ies for im -
provement . 

CAPE was created to 
provide a ba is of facts to 
support student efforts to 
change the c urricul urn . 
"Nobody here i really 
gettilTg what they want," 
Cushing aid , ' and he 
believes that no one can ask 
fOI power to make chang!" 
w ith p ut legiti mate i n -
formation to ba k up th Ir 
ideas 

TWice yearly the Center 
Indep<'ndently publishes 
the CAPl re ult s ror ea h 

course surveyed the Center 
tallies student responses t 
15 questions on the cours 
and Instructor and assigns 
letter grades to each 
category For examp le , a 
profes or may merit an A- in 
"enthusiasm in course" and 
a C in "accessibility outside 
of class ." 

In their report , CAPE's 
coordinators al 0 sum 
marize the students' written 
comments in a brief note t 
suppiement the data . 
"Many students conSider 
this a va luable learning 
experience," the Spring 7 3 
report concludes , or " thE' 
text tS terrible, and probably 
should be replaced ."

NAACP Sues UC for 

Racial Discrimination 
In what they ca lled "one of the most important public 

discrimination cases ever filed," the National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, 
Western Region, has filed a formal complaint against 
the state's second largest employer, the University of 
California. 

The University of California's employment of blacks 
is, according to the NAACP, worse than any university 
of Mississippi. University records that the NAACP 
obtained reveal that : 

1. Of 4,274 faculty members that have been granted 
lifetime tenure, only 37 (.9%) are black; 

2. While 5.7% of all graduate students are black, only 
25 of the last 2,000 graduate research assistants were 
black ; 

3. Over 10% of laborers in the state are black, while 
blacks account for only 4% of the Universi ty of 
California's 1,276 craftsmen ; 

4. Not one of the top 100 management personnel 
reporting to the President of the University, and 
therefore responsible for affirmative action, is black; 

5. Only ten (2%) of the 545 librarians employed at the 
nine campuses are black despite the fact that nearly 
10% of the qualified librarians in the state are black; 

6. And in no major job category are blacks 
represented in the work force . 

The NAACP further contends that " upon information 
and belief, no large white collar employer in Californ ia 
has a worse employment record for blacks than the 
University of Californ ia ." 

It was found that si milar patterns and practices of 
exclusion exist for Mexican-Americans, who constitute 
18% (3,758,000) of the state's population , and for other 
m inorit ies as well . 

The type of relief the NAACP is seeking in this suit is 
as follo ws: 

1. The University shall be enjoined from any hiring or 
promotion of facu lty members, administrat ive per-
sonnel earning over $12,000 a year or craftpersoilS until 
it submits to the court and the NAACP, Western Region , 
and affirmative action plan containing ' a) specific goals 
and timetables providing for 11% black faculty, 
management personnel and craftpersons within ten 
years ; b) modifications of tenure and seniority to 
eliminate the discriminatory impact of past "patterns 
and practices" of discrimination and exclusion; and c ) a 
proposal to end present racial salary inequities and 
tenure disparities . 

2. Damages in th e amount of back wages and sa laries . 
3. The NAACP, Western Region, be permitted to 

intervene and play an active role in the prosecution of 
the case; and

Student Activity 
Center Nears COmpletion 

In about two weeks the student activity center will be 
finished . The three two-story buildings will house two 
large recreation rooms the Student Affairs office, space 
for twenty clubs, the school radio station, and other 
services. 

The center will include a large lounge (complete with 
fireplace, stage, and conversation area); a ping-pong 
and pool room ; an information center (dealing with 
traveling and entertainment); a movie room; and space 
for KSDT and the counseling offices of George Murphy 
and staff . 

Only phase one of the center will have been com-
pleted, however. The second step will be twice as large 
and include shops, a recreation building, crafts, and 
possiblv an outdoor swimming pool. One of these 
activity centers is planned for each group of four 
colleges. 

The first part has cost S550,000, paid from tuition and 
activity fees . The second step should be completed, 
according to the architect in charge, Bob Thorburn , in 
late 1975. 

Student Activism 
continued from page 1 
and approved through the 
proper faculty channels . 

When the Regents (one 
of whom commented, 
" Having a little of Cleaver is 
like being a little pregnant") 
met in September, they 
voted that guest lecturers 
would only be allowed one 
appearance within a term . 
(Reagan, whose proposals 
tended to be more specific, 
suggested that Cleaver be 
banned from all the UC 
campuses.) The ruling 
reversed previous decisions, 
wherein the Regents had 
delegated all responsibi lity 
for curriculum planning to 
facul ty agencies on the 
respectiv.e campuses . 

The governor, however, 
seem ed to want more 
power for th e Regents-he 
proposed, at the October 
meeting, that the Regents 
assume control over course 
planning and approva l , 
faculty appointments, and 
all degree awards. The 
chairmen of the Regents 
declared the motion out of 
order, because additional 
guest lecturer discussion 
had al ready been tabled . 

It all came home in 
November . The Regents 
met at UCSD, and, in what 
was the climax of the 
Cleaver controversy, 
modified the September 
guest lecturer resolution by 
delegating the power to 
grant permission for ad-
ditional appearances to the 
president o f the university, 
who in turn delegated it to 
the chancellors. The ruling 
basically returned the 
power whence it came in 
September. 

UCSD welco med the 
Regents to La Jolla with a 
si lent convocat ion, 1500 
strong, outside the meeting 
place. (There had been 
violence at the October 
Sa nta Cruz meet ing- the 
si lence was undoubtedly 
mor unseltling in many 
ways .) [Juring the days 
pr eeding and following 
the meeting, the campus 
wa hopping with activity. 
There were planning 
mE'eting,. a hunger trikt" , 

and an Academic Senate 
meeting in which the 
Regents were censured for 
building barriers to 
academic freedom. People 
were seriously considering 
the meaning of the terms 
'education' and 'un iversity' , 
and considering the eHects 
a group of rich businessmen 
should have on that 
meaning. UCSD was ac-
tivist. 

After meeting in January 
to dig up courses they 
didn't like and dispose of 
them, the Regents returned 
to Berkeley, hoping to 
avoid a repetition of the 
Santa Cruz violence. But, 
coincidental with the 
Regent 's m eeting, the 
Berkeley Third World 
Liberation Front was 
conducting a strike, and the 
situation immediately 
deteriorated to the point 
where demonstrators 
clashed with the National 
Guard and police. 

The February meeting 
was a crucial one for UCSD. 
Chancellor M cG ill an-
nounced t hat he had 
renewed the contract of 
philosopher and professor 
Herbert Marcuse . Th is 
action was rather frustrating 
for the governor, fo r 
al tho ugh M cGi ll had 
promised to allow the 
Regents to review his 
deciSion, he mentioned that 
he had signed Marcuse's 
contract the day before the 
meeting . Ass emblyman 
John Stull, who bad , the 
year before called for the 
dismissal of the UCSD 
students who had par-
tiCipated in a demon-
stration during which a flag 
was burned, requested that 
both Marcuse and McGill 
be fired by the Regents . The 
Regents declined . (1000 
UCSD students had signed a 
petition requesting that 
Marcuse be kept on the 
faculty.) 

The Regents voted 'n 
April (again at Berkeley, 
again amid violence) to 
reclaim authority over the 
hiring and firing of faculty 
members on the UC 
rampuses. This ruling was 

missions and Student Affairs, will cover "The Ad-
mIssIons Sct'lIe" In addition UCSD Counseling 
Psychologists Hugh Pates, Ph .D . and Robert Kavanaugh, 
Ph.D. will lead sessions on "$haring About Our Medical 
Future" and "The Human Equation in the Application 
Process" respectively . Mrs. Parks will be available for 
question/ answer sessions on "Entry Expectations - What 
Credentials Do I Need" and " Application Procedures for 
1974-75." 

Winter quarter the Career Planning/ Health Sciences 
Advisory Program will present a series of 6 Alternate 
Health Careers Seminars, time and place to be an-
nounced. In the spring a class oriented toward the 
freshman/ sophomore premedical student will be of-
fered . 

Honors Program 
Dffidline Soon 

Juniors who are history 
majors and who have a 3.5 
GPA in history and a 3.0 
overall are urged to con-
sider applying for the 
Honors Program in History. 

The program is designed 
as the capstone of the 
history major program . It 
provides the student an 
opportunity under the 
direct supervision of a 
member of the faculty to do 
intensive work in 
historiography and to be 
trained in the techniques of 
research and writing. The 
final exercise, spread over 
two quarters, is the com-
position of a research paper 
which is, in the student's 

senior quarter, presented 
(and defended) to a 
colloquium consisting of 
the other students in the 
program and the faculty of 
the Department . 

Deadline for the ap-
plications is February 1. 
Forms for applying are 
avaiJabie in the History 
Office in Room 5024 H&SS. 
For additional information, 
students should consult 
either Professor Alden 
Mosshammer in Revelle 
College (Room 1556 H-L, 
Mon . Wed . Fri . 10-11) or 
Professor Armin Rappaport 
in Muir College (Room 5073 
H&SS, Tues. 4-5, Wed . 2-3, 
or Thurs. 1-2. 

Financial Aids Deadline 
TO ALL STUDENTS WHO WISH TO APPLY FOR 

FINANCIAL AID: This includes Work-Study, Grants, 
Scholarships, and Loans. Student Financial Services is 
extending the dead I ine one week for receiving ap-
plications from January 15th to January 22 . Since our 
funds are limited, students who apply on time will have 
first priority. 

Applications will be available in the Provost's Office 
and at EDNA for your convenience. 

REMEMBER TO GET THE APPLICATION IN BY THE 
DEADLINE. The supporting material can be added later. 

interpreted as a vote of 
nonconfidence in the 
chancellors . It was the last 
dec ision of major im-
portance the Regents made 
that year , although 
demonstrations occured at 
the May meeting at UClA. 

Back Here 
We must note: much 

happened at UCSD that 
year that had nothing to do 
with the Regents . Student 
government pi cked up, 
both at Muir and Revelle, 
culminating with a coup of 
sorts in the spring, when the 
Muir Dorm President's 
Council declared itself the 
offi cia l student government 
of Muir College. It seems 
that no one minden '

More Abstract 

After a consideration of 
activism at UCSD during 
the 1968-1969 school year, 
we find the same looking-
4nward we saw the year 
before. People were 

conc'!rned, ~t ill a little 
se lfi shly, with th eir 
education rather than the 
war . There were co n-
f ront ation s between 
military recruiters and 
students on campus. and 
some con cern , around 
election t ime, for national 
and international issues, 
but I ittle to parallel that of 
the following year . You 
could say that the Regents 
opened one (collective) 
UCSD eye, and it took the 
long-range implications of 
the election of 1968 to open 
the other one.

OPINION 

Bulletin! 
Nixton Speech 

President Ri chard Nixton made a surprise radio and 
television address last evening. The text of it foliONS: 

"My fellow Americans, . 
Recent developments in the Watergate tnal have 

made it imperative that I speak out in my own defense. 
have tried to hoi d mysel f aloof from the petty partisan. 
propaganda that seeks to impugn my honor an.d thl;reby 
attack the ideals that I stand for - self-respect, indiVidual 
dignity and responsibility, national pride and st~e~gth -
ideals whi ch were endorsed by the greatest maJority In 
American history through my decis ive election a littl e 
more than a year ago . I have occupied myself in 
building the lasting structure of a Generation of Peace 
rather than feed the preoccupations of base, small 
minds and the news media. 

But striking developments of a few days ago may 
have created doubts, even in the minds of many loyal 
Americans, as to my own honesty and candor. As you 
may know, I am referring to the recent testimony of 
technical experts with respect to the eighteen minute 
gap found in one of the tapes that was subpoenaed by 
the Watergate grand jury . Their finding was that the gap 
in the tape resulted from a series of nine separate 
erasures . 

This seem s to disprove the theory that my secretary 
Rosemary Woods had erased the tape through an 
inadvertant act. The only reasonable conclusion is that 
the tape was erased purposefully by someone who had 
access to it. The tapes were carefully guarded, and 
besides Miss Woods, only my own assistant Stephen 
Bull and I could see them . I will not place the blame on 
Mr. Bull for this act, but rather will place the respon-
si bility where it belongs, on my own shoulders. I erased 
the tape . . 

I did so not to obstruct justice, not to shIeld myself 
from charges of criminal misconduct. My persecutors 
will of course jump to such a conclusion, but I must 
repeat, as I have many times in the past, that I had. no 
prior knowledge of the Watergate burglary, nor dId I 
spare any effort to bring the truth to light and the guilty 
to justice. . 

No , I did not erase the tape to protect myself. I did so 
fo r what I bel ieved to be the good of our country. The 
conversation with Bob Haldeman on this tape 'con-
tained a discussion of a matter of extreme sensitivity 
and confidentiality that was best left secret and secure 
from the glare of public controversy. Ironically, it had 
nothing whatsoever to do with Watergate; it was instead 
a very personal and private family matter. My deepest 
regret is that I erased the tape in so amateurish a 
fashion . 

But I believed , and still believe that in doing what I 
did I was breaking no law, covering up no wrongdoing 
of my administration, but only preserving the privacy of 
a fami Iy matter which if revealed would do no good and 
perhaps much harm to the moral climate of our nation. 

I would certainly prefer to maintain the secrecy in 
this matter. But constant houndinG by my implacable 
enemies has forced me to resort to my last, best, and 
ultimate defense - full and candid disclosure of the 
whole truth. It is deeply painful to me to speak of these

matters, bu t I fear that this may be the only way for me 
to retain the mandate with which I hope to lay the 
foundations for an eternally strong, prosperous and 
secure America . 
I will be brief. In my conversation with Bob Haldeman, 
an honored and very close personal friend , I laid bare 
my heart on something which I had f irst learned the: 
preceding evening. This was, that my daughter Julie had 
recently had an abortion . She took this step, not out of 
frivolity or a ca llous permissiveness, but on the personal 
advice of her physician.l who had determined that both 
she and her husband David were carriers of a defective 
!J!ne. If their child were to receive th is gene from both 
parents, th~child could be ~ely deformed, crippled, 
tortured and ~ickly . David and Julie felt that an abortion 
was the best way out of thi s dilemma, and so followed 
their physician 's advice . . 

When I learned of thi s I was deeply troubled . I could 
not mndemn David and Julie for their action , but sti ll I 
Ie It uneasy and unsure, and so I sought out the council 
a nd comfort of my friend Bob. I was also very con-
ce rned about the possi bl e consequences of this matter 
becoming known to the general publiC. Millions d 
Americans look up to their President .as a moral leader, 
as a source of guidance in dark and troubled times. If it 
were to appear that I had in any way sanctioned t he 
taking of innocent, helpless human life, the whole 
moral fiber of our nation might suffer a severe setback. 
Few understand so clearly as I the importance of the 
principle of the sanctity of human life . 

<And so both for the sake of the privacy of my 
daughter ~nd son-in-law, and for the good of the nation 
as a whole, I sought to maintain silence on the matter. 
When it appeared that , contrary to all honored legal 
precedents of executive privilege, the Watergate grand 
ju IV was to be permitted to subpoena my personal 
tapes, I erased the segment of tape dealing with this 
matter, without the knowledge or advice pf anyone else. 

I felt that I was right, and I still feel so. Of course 
there will be those few who will still shrilly accuse me of 

cover~ p or obstruction of justice . But I ask you tonight, 
my fellow Americans, if you can find it in your hearts to 
condemn me for an action in whi ch, at great personal 
risk, I sou ght to defend and uphold the di gnity of Man. 

Ultimately a President's ability to govern depends on 
the faith and trust which the people have in him. If you 
will give me your trust, we can work together to bu i ld a 
nation and a world of peace, prosperity, piety and 
dignity, in which each man knows the sanctity of 
human li fe, and the dignityof the human soul. 

In closing, I would like to ask that tomorrow be a day 
of national prayer for David and Julie, and for all the 
other thousands of couples who are unfai rly deprived of 
the joy of bearing their own children . It is a grave grief, 
a somber sorrow; let them all know that our prayers are 
with them . And nON I will say good night, and may God 
bless you ." 

Reaction to the speech was immediate . Gerald Ford 
called it "the most noble statement made by a political 
figure in recent history," and said that " this should lay 
to rest all the unfounded doubts as to the President's 
integrity." Barry Goldwater described himself as 
" Deeply moved," and expressed sympathy for the 
Eisenhowers. Frank Mankiewicz described the speech as 
"Nixton's finest move since Checkers ."

Poll Results Disclosed 
f. recent Gullet Poll showed that 85 % of the 

American public believed that Arnold Klappe, 26, of Sa.n 
Marino , California, was guilty of the rape murder of hIS 

moth~r and the razor mutilation of his homosexual 
partner Andy Wartwell . However, the poll showed that 
only 27 % bel ieved that Klappe should in any way be 
punished . Most negative responses to thiS questIon 
came from people who bel ieved that to punish Klappe 
wou Id be to admit that our coun try had failed in raising 
its young, and thus would result in national loss of face. 
Others cited sympathy for Klappe. " After all , boys Will 
be boys," was an unusually frequent response from 
those polled . Several citizens' groups have been 
organized to support Klappe, and a new booster song, 
"Clap for Klappe ," has recently been released on DikNik 
Records.

"Pia), II Again Sam" ilnd "Ta"e the Mone\' and Run," 
and in their shadow5, "SIet'per" seelm "lt't more than 
an acceptably amusing digression from better tImes . 

The film comes complete with soml' of Allen 's 
funniest one-liners and sight gags, but the flaw that 
damages the film is Allen 's lapses into seriousness . 

The departures from comedy are few, but when they 
occur, they are so conspicuous and clumsy as to make 
any Woody Allen buff wonder at the reason behind 
them It almost appears as if Allen were attempting to 
show the audience glimpses of his dramatic talent, 
which would be fine in any other place but in a comedy 
vehicle Hi Insane humor placed beside uch attempts 
at seriousness create such a schi m In the plot, that it 
tends to "pu t you off" for extended periods 

Thp plot finds Allen 200 year into the future, being 
brought out of uspended animation by ome 
revolut,oniHY scientists in a "Big Brother" ociety. 

Allen 's co -star, Diane Keaton is acceptable as hI 
female companion, but the rol could have been played 
with the sam e success by just about anyone, ince 
neither the role, nor Ms. Keaton' ta lents were any big 
thing . It seems that each time Allen does a new film, he 
winds up carryi ng an in reasingly larger load. The 
supporting cast I n only med,ocre, which is ad when 
you consider that Allen could u I" much better talent, 
wi thou t any worry of r::very being upstaged . 

When "Sleeper" is good, it's great. Allen 's bag of 
tricks includes his usual self degrading remarks about 
his sexual prowess and his family as well as some w II 
placed satire on the 1960's. His gimmick's include 
orgasm machi nes , gay robots and some good old 

fashioned slap~tick routines which keep the film movil1: 
along Oller those dramatic rough spots I mentioned. 

There is no doubt that the film is worth the price of 
admission, but it is not Woody Allen's best ... and I hq>e 
his best is yet to come.

"Don't Loo" Now" is the second film I've seen that 's 
been adapted from a Daphne DuMaurier story, (the 
other being Hitchcock's "The Birds") and it's also the 
second time I feel that she has sold m~ a bill of goods 

Because of the very nature of the phenomena which 
wps the subject of "The Birds," the non-committal 
ending served the purpose of leaving the audience 
su pended in the dimension of the unknown, while it 
allowed DuMaurier to dispense with the often 
troublesome task of coming up with a plausible ex-
planation . "Oon't LooI< Now" gives the audience an 
ending whi ch is pure unadulterated cop out. I'm certain 
tha t any crea tive writing instructor would return the 
story to her , and uggest that she re-write the ending. 

The sham e of it all is, that apart from this tragically 
inept finale, the movi is the best I've seen all year. The 
story ha an excellent plot, very well paced and ex-
tremely suspenseful. Even the acting is excellent..but 
that damn ending! 

Donald Sutherland has never been better. His talents, 
as well as hi s appearance, are p rfectly uited to the 
macabre, eerie goings on, while julie Christie serves 
adequately a his wife, more prone to belief in the 
super natural than he.A good supporting cas t rounds out 
the better poi nts of the fi 1m.

Who's Got the Blues? 
On Friday, January 18, the Campus 

Program Board will present the <, Iec-
trifying blues sound of Lowell Fulson, 
with Robert "Rock Me" Jeffries, in 
cOllcert at 8 :30 pm in Revelle Cafeteria. 
Admission will be 50 cents for UCSD 
students with 10, and $1 for the general 
audience . Tickets are at the Urey Hall 
box office . 

A singer and guitarist whose important 
contributions to the growth of urban 
blues are largely unknown to the white 
audience, Lowell Fulson was born in 
Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1921 . H is first 
professional musica l e~perience came in 
1938, but it was not until after his 
discharge from the navy in 1945 that he 
moved to California and began his 
recording career . 

His earliest recordings are magnificent 
examples of the Texas-based acoustic 
guitar tradition, but after some ex-
perience in the nightclubs of Oakland, he 
quick'y switched to working with lectric 
guitar and a large band . During the 
1950', Lowell's popularity among- the 
black record-buying public became 
firmly established, and his influence 
among blues musicians outside Chicago 
rivalled that of B.B. King and T-Bone 
Walker . 

Among h is many noteworthy recor-
dings are "Sinner's Prayer" (covered by 
Ray Charles in his early days on Atlantic). 
"Reconsider Baby" (considered by most 
blues historians to be a post-war classic), 

and thl' drrving "Tollin' Bells" (featured 
on Lowell 's excellent reIssue album 
"Hung Down Head," on Chess records) 

More recently, Low II has recorded for 
the i\ent and jewell labels . His album "In 
a Heavy Bag" on Jewel exhibits the in-
fluerce of modern trends , but un-
fortunately . he has not received the 
acclaim accorded (somewhat belatedly) 
by whites to many of his peers, including 
Muddy Waters and B.B. King . In the past 
few years, the proliferation of music 
festivals devoted to blues and/or Jazz has 
helped remedy this situation, and it is 
hoped that Lowell's appearance at UCSD 
will aid further in popularizing this well -
respected bluesman . 

Robert " Rock Me" Jeffries was born In 
Tulsa, Oklahoma , and brought up in a 
musical household . He started playing 
blind lemon songs on the guitar but soon 
drifted to what became his first love - the 
piano. The success of his old pi cking 
buddy Tom Shaw prompted Bob to try 
ome professional gig and he can be 

heard playing piano with Tom (and 
singing too) on hi Advent album Bob 
has si nce appeared at several festivals 
and recorded for the Blue Goose 
Company . He is a prolific blues 
ongwriter and a c lassic piano pounder 

So, if you dig boogie and blues (or 
would like the opportunity to find out 
what it's all about) this is a concert not to 
be missed .

burning the midnight 011 
lately what with taking up

playing basketball and arm 
wrestling with girls, the staff 
hasn't had mUCl, time to 
study but after all, ~hy are 
we here at college anVway? 
The truth is that fighting off

these time consuming 
activities, the staff has 
come up with the greatest 
idea of the year for you 
~ports fans and sensitivists 
(tickle-tickle) all over the 
world 

The truth of the matter is 
that Chet came up with the 
idea and a great one it is. 
What kind of contest offers 
one the ability to freely use 
hi s imagination and 
creativity? What kind of 
contest a lIows the losers as 
well as the winners as WElL 
as the noncombatants to 
come out on top? On top of 
all this , the greatest 
possible prize in existence 
is being offered to the 
winner as well as fame and 
probably the resultant 
fortune from fame such as 
commercia l monies and T-

~ hirts bearing his own 
name. 

The obvious answer is a 
limerick contest. The UT 
staff is encouraging you to 
turn in your version of a 
limerick . The rules are 
simple. A limerick is of-

Accusations Borne Out 

Letter from the Editor 
by Eric bilten 
Sports Editor 

Looking at Jast wet!ks 
sports page, I happened to 
notice a headline that read 
"Cagers Lose Two, Fan 
Apathy Blamed." Reading 
the story, I received the 
distinct impression that 
UCSD students were being 
blamed for the losses of the 
basketball team . 

As Sports Editor of this 
publication, I felt that it 
was my duty to investigate 
the accusations of one of 
my writers . The accusations 
that I looked into were: 1) 
Whether a visiting team was 
actually able to get enough 
of their rooters to the game 
to outnumber the home 
team's rooters, and if this 
were true that 2) the visiting 
team's rooters would still be 
able to be "a lot more 
Vociferous" than the Triton 
fans, and finally 3) that the 
Triton cheerleaders did not 

do their assigned task of 
leading cheers. 

To my dismay, I found 
that the accusations made 
were not only not true, but 
were also quite un-
derplayed. It seemed to me 
that I had stumbled into the 
opposing team's gym, the 
cheers, coming from the 
USIU's side of the gym, were 
so deafening. Counting the 
rooters of both sides, I also 
noticed that Triton fans 
(and I use the term VERY 
loosely) were outnumbered 
about five to onel 

Another accusation in 
the same light made was 
that perhaps some of the 
people had come just to see 
one player, who spent most 
of the game on the bench. 
To these people I will just 
say that basketball , and 
most other sports at UCSD, 
are team sports, where one 
individual cannot and will 
not be able to win a game

without the support of the 
rest of the team. Therefore 
all players on the ' team 
should be equally cheered 
for their achievements. 

As to the second point, 
the only cheering I heard 
was coming from the USIU 
fans . The only noise I heard 
from the Triton spectators 
was booing of the officials, 
(who I must admit did make 
some poor calls) who are 
only human beings trying to 
do a tough job. 

Also negative noises were 
heard almost every time 
that bne USIU player, a 
great player by the narre of 
Jimmy Sullivan, was able to 
get his hands on the ball. 
His ability was shown by 
the way he conducted 
himself, finishing with 45 of 
his team's 74 points and 9 
assists. 

The third point showed 
itself to also be true as I saw 
the Triton cheerleaders (a 
better name for them might 
be routine doers) com-
pletely oIJtclassed by the 
USIU cheerleaders. I must 
admit that the routines 
done by the UCSD 
"cheerleaders" were fancy , 
quite precise dnd well 
worked out, but I was under 
the impression that the 
chief duty of the 
cheerleader was to leacf the 
crowd in cheers . Transportation will be S3 

per person (due to the 
energy crisis) and lift tickets 
will cost S4 . The tran-
sportation cost must be 
paid when you sign up, and 
there will be no refunds .

Maybe this is an old-
fashioned view, and if this 
is the case, I would like to 
be informed about the new 
definition of the 
cheerleader. 

In closing , I must 
commend Coach Bill 
Reeves and the Triton 
basketball team for their 
continued efforts despite 
the overwhelming lack of

of the round robin variety. 
Each school will compete 
agai nst every other present. 

The first four teams will 
then move on to the semi-
finals where the teams in 
first place will play the 
team in fourth place while 
the second place team will 
play the third place team. 

The Tritons have high 
expectations for th i s 

tournament but are under 
no delusions either . It can 
be guaranteed that they will 
represent their school well 
and a big upset would not 
be inconceivable . 

I t is a known fact that 
teams perfom1 better when 
they have crowd support 
behind them. The Triton 
volleyball team is no ex-
ception.

Following this editorial is 
a schedule of the remaining 
games that the basketball 
team has. Now there should 
be no reason for anyone to 
say that they were not able 
to support their team.

create an image closer to the East End of London, a la 
Jack the Ripper, than to that of Venice as most tourists 
see it. 

The setting is perfect for this story, concerned with 
"second-sight" and premonitions of death. An op-
p,ressive air envelopes the entire film right up to it's 
shocking, although improbable ending . The film 
abou nds with sinister hooded figures, blind seers, a 
strangely sinister priest (whose connection with the 
whole affair I never qui te understood) and a general 
undercurrent of fear. 

For creating the desired effect, there is no doubt as to 
the film's superiority. Neither is their any problem with 
acting, direction or photography . The film in itself is 
one of the year 's best. It is DuMaurier's story that is 
lacking. 

"Don't LQOk Now" is well worth seeing, in fact, for 
any lover of the macabre, missing this one would be 
sinfu l ... just don 't expect a palatable explanation, 
because the ending crosses the fine line that separates 
the supernatural from the truly unbelievable .

Don Milker 

Fa- l(Ners of nostalgia (a la Cole Porter), the Off 
Broadway Theatre is presenting Ben Bagley's review, 
The Decline iIJ'Id FoIlI of the Entire World as Seen 
Throulh the Eyes of Cole Porter. The show is fast, funny, 
and enjoyable. 

Decline and hll is a brief sketch' of the life and work 
of Porter as related to the world events transpiring at 
that time. Although there is a strong effort to present 
some of Porter's more obscure songs, such favorites as I 
GC!t iI Kick Out of You, Night ilnd Day, I Lo\/e Paris, and 
Anything Goes were added to please the public . 

Yvonne De Carlo heads a cast of energetic musical-
comedy performers, consisting of Sybil ·Scotford, Kelly 
Britt, George Reeder, Jerry Clark, and Rita Cantos .. The 
singing is generally very good ... the dancing is en-
thusiastic (althougfl It needs tightening in places), and 
the obvious pleasure of the performers was contagious. 

Although most of the show is blatantly funny, and 
scenes are often done "camp," there are several serious 
numbers which were well done, primarily by Ms. De 
Carlo. Rita Cantos also had a fine legitimate voice, 
which provided a nice counter-point to the more 
musical·comedy oriented members of the cast .

A true review is somewhat of a rarity in San Diego, 
and it is pleasant to see one done nicely. The intimate 
size of the Off Broadway Theatre makes a good setting 
for this type of production , and Director Harold Lang 
did much to insure that The Decline <tnd Fall of the 
Entire World il5 Seen Through the Eyes of Cole Porter 
can p10vide an evening of wholesome entertainment for 
all . 

Curtain is at 8:30, and it close's January 20, so make 
plans to see it soon .
