EAP Student Awarded Honors 
Wendy Kuest, a Roosevelt senior studying in South 

Africa through the UC Education Abroad Program, was 
awarded two certificates of merit after spending a 
year at the University of Natal in Pietermaritzburg. 

Kuest. a double major In political science and 
Third World studies, had never been away from San 
Diego before traveling 10,000 miles to KwaZulu· 
Natal. Kuest was part of the first group of students 
ever to study in South Africa under the Education 
Abroad Program. 

Efforts to establish an academic-exchange rela-
tionship between the University of California and 
South African institutions of higher education were 
spearheaded by EAP Director John Marcum, a widely 
published expert on African politics and African higher 
education. 

In addition to the University of Natal, EAP recently 
reached an agreement with the University of Cape 
Town for an exchange program. Currently, eight UC 
students are studying in South Africa under the EAP 
program.

Grad. Speaker Selection 
Needs Student Input 

Yes, it rt:all y is true . Ho use peake r ew t 
G ingrich has been selected to spL:ak at CSD's 199 
a ll -campus comm e nce ment cere mony. 

But fo rge t the fac t that Gingri c h is hi g hl y contro-
versia l and unpopular in the eyes o f many_ The ques-
ti o n that needs to be addressed is, would the stude nt 
body have e lectt:d to choose G ing ri ch as comme nce-
me nt speake r? O r anyone else for that matte r'! 

The fac t is, the SllIdent body is given little to no 
0 PPor1unity to select at the ir o wn 'choosi ng a speake r 
ro r it s own comme ncement cere mony. G raduating 
seni rs , especia ll y, should be a ll owed to have some 
input as to how the ir comme nce me nt cere m nies will 
be re membe red by fam ily and fri e nds . 

C hances are, the studt:nt body wou ld probably 
se lect mo re nonpo lit ica l speake rs . T he admini strati on 
fail s to take into account that the stude nt body may 
reali ze there is mo re to life than po liti cs. 

Allowing the stude nts to se lect a speake r on the ir 
o wn is a pre fe rable optio n; pe rhaps UCS D woul d 
the n lure more e ndearing candidates suc h as acto rs, 
comedinns, writers o r philosophe rs . 

To those who di sagree w ith the se lection of 
G ingrich, W I;; offe r thi s c nso lati on: indi vid ual co l-
lege cere monies al ways provide a n a lte rna tive venue 
in which to celebratL: the graduati on o f that certa in

Admit Day Should Reflect 
Actual Campus Life 

Thousands of admit ted studen ts callle to UCSD 
last Saturday to ge t a taste of co llege life . T he eve nt 
was meti c ulously pla nned a nd, more than li ke ly, 
Illany hi gh schoo l seni ors le ft campus inte nding to 
come back ro r good . 

However, some o f next yea r 's freshme n wi ll sure -
ly be di sappoi ntL:d when they rea li ze that Adm it Day 
was about as n:pre sL: nt ati VL: of U SO a~ the new T V 
show " Pu sh" is o r 'o ll ege li fe . 

SOOI1 , nex t year 's freshme n wi ll reali ze tha t the 
Marsha ll u ltu ra l Celebration doc~n ' t ha ppt:tl every 
wee kend and that hancd lor Robert Dynes rare ly 
spe nds hi s time talking to stude nt s in the Price ente r. 

It is wrong of the Admit Day planne rs to mi slead 
students into thinking that UCS D is a more exciting 
place than it really is_ Yes, we do have e vents like the 
Sun God Festi va l, the Watemle lon Drop and Vendo r 
Fa irs, but e vents like these don ' t happen every day. 

If we want to have a ha ppy s tude nt body. the 
Admit Day planne rs should c reate a day o f ac ti vitie s 
in which prospective stude nts a re provided with a 
mo re representative vie w o f LJCSD. 

Or, the y should t:ncourage stude nts to vis it UCS D 
at any othe r time so they could rea li ze that the re is

'MINORITY' ISSUES ARE 
FRAUGHT WITH HYPOCRISY 

COMMENTARY: Assigning the term "minority" only to certain ethnic groups is 
an inconsistent process th at excludes indi viduals from other cultural backgrounds

ity. There is no etymolog icat inferi -
orit y associa ted with the word

Additionall y, there is nothing

metaph ysical , la w lhat when you sepa-
ra te mon: than 50 percent of some-
th ing fro,,! the whole. what is lert is 
less than 50 percent - a natura lly

Fo ll()w ing th is argumenl , I :1m not 
clear a ~ 10 why il is ~o wrong tll 

addres~ ,omCOIlC a~ a "minori ty." I am 
fami liar with the h i~tor i c a l precedent 
dictat ing that "minorit y" carries nega-
tiv.: connotations. hUI contemporary 
USI: of that word is not alway~ rooted 
in tradition_ 

The second major hypocrisy I li nd 
wi th underreprescnted rtI ' ial groups 
claiming Ih ' po lit ica t incorrectness of 
the word "minority" is that they arc 
reti.:rring only to racia l groups. not eth-
nic groups. 

My point here is not 
to belittle the fate of 
other minorities. N r 
Is It to escalate the 
standing of Jews on 
the minority scale. It 
Is to demonstrate the 
relative arbitrariness 
of how we assign 
social standing In this 
country, how we 
address social groups 
and how we justify 
our Intolerant 
behavior. 

There arc rar more minorities out 
Ihere th ,lIl just Asi ans, hl ack and 
Latinos. Technicall y, We~ t Indians are 
of a diflcrent ethn icity than African 
Americans, even though their ski n 
color is remarkably similar. Even fur-
ther, he yond ethnicit y lies religion - a 
distinction orte n ignored in minority 
issues. 

The prohlem with exdudi ng re li -
gion from issues of underrepresenta-

ti on is that people who ascrihe 10 c.: r-
la in religions actuall y have an ethni ci -
ty or culture rooted in th ose rel igions 
- k ws , for example. 

Many people un not understand 
that Judaism is not jusl a reli gion - il 
is a culture. I al11 a child of two 1cwish 
paren" and eve ryo ne of my ancestors. 
a~ far back a~ we can Irace, is lcwish. 
I was ra i ~eu belongIng to a conserva -
ti ve ~y n a gogue - the middle leve l of 
re li gious inten ~ it - and bat l11ilf.va-
hed. 

!I.~ an ad ult , I do nOI hel ieve in reli-
gion because I cannot he lieve in the 
CO l111llon concept ion, or God. I alll . 
howeve r, very much ~ Iil l a Jew. My 
manneri sms arc Jewish, there is a 
, prinkl ing of Yiddish in my speech 
and man y of my alt itudes are based on 
the lcwish cultu re. 

What pesters me a bit is that Jews 
are rarely acknowledged as a minority 
because we stereotypicall y are of a 
cert ain socioeconomic standing_ Jews 
represent less than 1.5 percent of the 
world population and not much more 
than that in this country. In the strictest 
sense of the word, we are a minorit y. 

Is th is oversight somebody's way 
of tell ing everyone that iI group of peo-
ple must generall y be economically

INCREASE MAY NOT BE A GOOD IDEA 
Editor: 

T his is a leiter in re~ ponse 10 
Ihe Mon., Apri I 6. 1998 leiter 10 
the edilor by Tony Fiori , the cur-
rent A.S. Vi <.: e President Fi nan ce . 
Tony and I have se rved on A.S. 
w unci l for many years and I 1'..: 11 
that the leiter masked many of the 
cri tica l and fundamenlat iss uc~ of 
increasing the A.S. student acti vi-
ty fee. 

Bu: befo re I delve in to the issue 
of the current A.S. proposed fee 
referendum, I wanled to give stu-
dent s fac tual and hi storical aspccts 
of the A.S. student acti vity fee. 
Thi s is the only way slude nt s can 
make a proper and informed deci-
sion on the referendum. 

I) Back in 1985, A.S. w unci I 
proposed a quarterly student activi -
ty fee increase at $5.50 per sludent ; 
this raised Ihe AClivity Fee from $H 
10 $ 13.50. 

2) In 1994-95 and 11)95-96, 
there wcre fa iled altempts to 
increase the sludenl ad ivity fec to 
support A.S. acti vi ties . ca mpus 
sports and inlram urals. 

3) A.S. hi storicall y has not heen 
accountable to their goal s and 
promises. thus there arc no "guar-
antecs" in funding. 

4) AS . currently has un ann ual 
hudget of $675. 1 00. Within thai, 10 
percent each year is funneled in to a 
reserve account thill helps fund 
A .. services and A S. sa l ari e~ . 

5) AS. passed Ihis Ifee referen-
dal hallolmeasurc in council ralher 
than assess ing the student body like 
other fee referenda, such u ~ the 
Acadel11 ic Success Program . 

Tony's teller masks muny of Ihe 
fundamental issues hy exploiting 
the fears of sludents. By Ihn:i1l cn-
ing to cut major soc ial and pro-
gramming event~, , uch a~ Ihe Sun 
God Festivat (UCS D's pri zed po,-

or all you animation fanatics, 
the 1998 Spike and Mike's 
Classic Festival of Animation 
is now showing at the Muse-
um of Contemporary Art in 
La Jolla. This year's festi val 
showcases a line-up of a ll -

new lilms by tOOay's hOliest anima-
tors, Incidentally, ror all you sadi sts 
out there, thi s is not to he confused 
with the Sick and Twisted FC'Stiva l o f 
Ani mation. 

If you have never been to a Spike 
anti Mike show before, it is worth-
while to go out and see one. For one 
thing, It Illay be the onl y p l ac~ other 
than Las Vega~ where the ticket-tak-
ers dr~ss like Elvis Presley. Fifteen 

minut~s bcl'ore show time, "Elvis" is 
kind enough to provide the audience 
with four huge halloons ~o that eager 
fest i val -goers can cntertain them-
~e lves . 

Another unique facet to this popu-

quality lit!s on a continuum ranging 
from the bad to the good. Unronu-
nate ly, even though this co llection is 
4uitc entenaining, it is less spectacu-
lar than the shows of previous years. 

Some of the festi val's highlight s 
incl ude "Geri 's Ga llic" by Pi xar Stu-
dios, the same animation studio that 
created "Toy Story." The computer-

Cour tesy 01 Twentieth eentur y Fox/Deana Newcomb 
Crime Spree: Matthew McConaughey stars as Willi s Newton in 'The Newton Boys,' 
the true-life story of America's most successful bank robbers.

McConaughey and Ulrich shine in The Newton Boys' 
The Newton Boys 
*** Starring: Matthew McConaughey. Skeet UlriCh, 
Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, Julianna Mar· 
gulies and Dwight Yoakam , 

By Asaph Amlr 
Sra(( Writer 

'The ewton Boys," from 20th Century 
Fox, is a tastefu l and very amusing period 
drama whidl tell s the true story of four 
hank -rohhing brothers from prohibition - ~ra 
Texas who go out of their way not tn kill 
anybody, 

Texas native Matthew McConaughey 
("A Time to Kill") leads thi s ensemble piece 
as Willi s Newton, an ex-con who conceiws 
and instigates a series of rohberies, Willis 
wants to he a legi timate businessman - an 
oilman - but he is convinced that he can' t 
lega ll y rai se enough lIloney for investment. 

Joi ning th~ charming and cava li er Willis 
arc hi s farmer brothers Joe, Jcss and Dock 
played by Skeet Ulrich, Ethan Hawke and 
Vincen t D'Onofrio. respectively. 

U l ri ~ h ("S~ream") stea ls the show as Joe, 
the awkward. youngest brolher of the crime 
quartet. His character is also the one source 
of dissent among the brothers; he rai ses ethi-
cal objections to bank robbing, However, hi s 
voice is quick ly drown\!cI out by the rational -
ized, moral conviction uf gang-IC<lder Willis. 

Wi llis justifies stea ling by projecting 
blame onto the unscrupul ous hanks and insur-
an~e companies. Besides, he argues, hank 

robbing is the only way one can estahlish 
enuugh collateral to linam:e a more I ~gitimatc 

car~er pursuit. li ke sell ing up an oil we ll. 
A mustachi oed Ethan Hawke ("Reality 

Bites") plays the llall1boyant , boozehound 
brother, Jess, whi Ie D'Onofrio ("Fu II Melal 
Jacket") is Dock, the l1Iost hardened crillli -
nal of the lot. 

Joi ning the four brother. is country singer 
Dwight Yoakam, who performs well as 
e)(plosives cxp~rt Brentwood Glasscock, and 
Julianna Marguli es ("ER") as Louise Brown, 
thc token romantic interest to McConaugh-
ey 's Willis, Unfortunatel y, Margulies fail s to 
stand out against a male-dominated ea,t, 
especia lly McConaughey's oV\!rweening yet 
infect ious grin . 

The interaction between Willis and 
Louise not only fails to li ght sparks, but in 
some parts. also slows the pace of the film. 
However, the film compensates for its 
somewhat weak romanti c link wi th the 
strong sell se of loya lt y and familiar playful-
ness among the four hrothcrs . 

"The Newton Boys" is a refreshing and 
original film. with solid acti ng and plenty of 
charm. Like real life, it cloes not always 
achieve the greatest heights of drama, and for 
that reason it wi ll probably not gain a Vl:ry

However, the Illis~ion is sahotaged anti the 
famil y, the pilot and the saboteur become 
"Lost In S pace." 

New Line Ci nema's sc i-Ii/action movie, 
which lIlatie its premicr~ in theaters last Fri -
day, is one of the most success ful remakes 
of a dassic Alilerican telev ision show in 
recent history. The contemporary version of 
the story makes fu ll use of modern specia l 
effec ts as we ll as big-budget action 
sequences, 

Mt~r bringing in $20 million in its pl:n-
ing weckend, "Lo~t I n Space" landcd lirst at 
till: hox oflice, finally humping "Titanic" 
rrom t he top spot. 

All of the actors perform quite wel l, 
although Gary Oldillan stea ls most of the 
~cenc, a~ the si nister Dr. Smith. Matt leBlanc 
gCI ~ Ill()~t of the laughs a~ Major Don We~t. 

Naturally, the relat ionship between the 
young Will Rohinson (Jack Johnson) and 
the Rohot (the voice of Dick Tufeld) i, of 

primary importance to the plot and one or 
t h~ endearing relationships which unrllkb

Dr. Smith 's plans for taking over the ship. 

"I play the ult imate space mother," said 
Mimi Rogers abou t her role as Maureen 
Robinson. Heal her Graham and Lacey 
Chabert play the Robi nson daughters, Judy 
and Penny, 

The li lm is ba 'cd on the 196Us television 
show or the same name which chronicles the 
adventures of the Rohi nson famil y as it trav-
els hctween uncharted planets whi le search-
ing for Earth ,

The degree to which Computer Generated 
Imagery (CG I) is used adds some interesting 
elemcnt s to the lilm, induding space dog-
lights, holographic naVigational charts and

All in all , the film is well -paced, exci t-
