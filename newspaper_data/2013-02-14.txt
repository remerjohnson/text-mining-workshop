Student Health Insurance Plan pre-
miums will soon increase, and certain 
benefits, such as dental and vision 
care, may be cut in order to finance a 
UC-wide SHIP def-
icit of $49 million.

SHIP was estab-
lished in 2001 for 
undergraduates and 
in 2009 for gradu-
ate and professional 
students. Prior to 
switching to the 
UC-wide system, 
UCSD maintained 
its own student health insurance. In 
a Sept. 1, 2001 letter, the University 
of California Office of the President 
expressed hope that a unified health 
insurance plan would allow all stu-
dents access to medical care at an 
affordable cost.

Under the current plan, UCSD 
undergraduates pay $385.46 per quar-
ter, while graduate students pay $594 
per quarter. Students also have the 
option to waive SHIP by demonstrat-
ing equal insurance coverage from an 
outside source.

But at the Feb. 6 A.S. Council meet-
ing, Campuswide Senator Matthew 
Mayeda and co-chair of the Well-
being Cluster Student Advisory Board 
Paulina Nuth explained in a special 

presentation that UCOP will need to 
raise SHIP fees beginning in the 2013–
2014 academic year. The SHIP deficit 
is partially the result of miscalculations 
by an outside consulting firm that 
priced UCSD students’ benefits at too 
low of a premium.

The total debt for all UC campuses 
is $49 million. UCSD owes more than 
any other school, with 27 percent of 
the debt.

Mayeda contended that the high 
price had nothing to do with abuse of 
the system on UCSD’s part.

“Our old insurance already had 
fairly generous benefits,” he said. “Our 
committee advised that we stay out of 
SHIP, but we were pressured by UCOP 
to join in.”

UCOP discussed three primary 
options to alleviate the debt. The first 
option establishes a percentage of the 
debt that each campus is required to 
manage each year. Under this plan, 
students will see a 93-percent increase 
in SHIP premiums over five years.

A second plan makes each campus 
responsible for its debt, and a third 
equalizes premiums for all UC stu-
dents with the plan.

Nuth warned council that none of 
these plans were best for students.

A series of changes to transportation services will not take place this July and have been put on hold indefinitely, according to a letter released 
Wednesday Feb. 13.

A letter from Vice Chancellor of Resource Management 
and Planning Gary Matthews to A.S. President Meggie Le 
and UC Student Association President Raquel Morales, 
dated Feb. 8, said that the administration would seek to 
establish a committee to discuss alternatives to proposed 
changes to parking prices and shuttle and bus accessibility.

Last month, UCSD Transportation Services announced 
an increase in parking costs in on-campus parking struc-
tures and for all permits. Additionally, the free Bus Zone 
sticker system will be discontinued, and students will need 
to purchase a partially subsidized pass from San Diego 
Metropolitan Transit System. Furthermore, the UCSD 

Arriba and Nobel shuttles would be integrated into a more 
frequent MTS SuperLoop line.

“To insure that we explore all viable options and pro-
vide positive review of suggestions contained within your 
petition and many heard at recent Town Hall meetings, I 
have asked Robert Holden Director of Auxiliary Business 
Services to postpone the implementation of any changes 
until we have had additional time to discuss alternatives,” 
Matthews wrote in his letter to Le and Morales. “The 
planned implementation in July will not go forward.”

Le said she received the letter via email on Feb. 11, 
and the Guardian obtained a copy of the letter Tuesday, 
Feb. 12.

Sixth College Senior Dies of  Heart Attack

Alireza Moaddel, a Sixth College 
senior, died of a heart attack early 
this week. He was found unrespon-
sive by his roommate the evening 
of Sunday, Feb. 10. Moaddel was an 
electrical engineering major and a 
theater minor. 

He attended Mt. San Antonio 
College before transferring to UCSD. 
His funeral was held Tuesday, Feb. 

12 in Westminster, Calif. Friends 
created a Facebook page in his 
honor on Monday, Feb. 11, and 
784 people had joined the page by 
Wednesday, Feb. 13. Moaddel was a 
member of UCSD’s Muslim Student 
Association. A family friend, Ehsaan 
Mesghal, said the family decided not 
to conduct an autopsy. They do not 
suspect foul play.

Moaddel was a spoken word 
poet. Mesghal said Moaddel was 
planning to perform at the MSA 

West Conference 2013 at UCSB this 
weekend, Feb. 15 to Feb. 17. They 
are working on using his allotted 
time as a memorial in his honor.

“Ali was an excellent spoken 
word poet and always used his time 
onstage to shed light on injustice 
around the world and the plight of 
others,” Mesghal wrote in an email 
to the Guardian.

a Facebook group uniting students 
against the impending changes 
quickly grew to more than 7,000 stu-
dent members. A similar initiative, 
Project Sumo, was launched to orga-
nize a protest against the changes for 
sometime later this year.

Le and Morales, who is also an 
undergraduate student at UCSD, 
met with Matthews, TPS Assistant 
Director Todd Berven and Director 
of Auxiliary Business Services 
Robert Holden on behalf of UCSD 
undergraduates to express a list of 
demands, which included paving over 
Torrey Pines Gliderport near Eleanor 
Roosevelt College to create student-
only parking spaces and keeping the 
Bus Zone sticker in effect.

Le said that postponing the imple-
mentation of any changes is good for 
students because it will allow more 
time for other options to be consid-
ered, but she warned that changes 
might still be on the horizon.

“This is not necessarily the end 
of fee increases,” Le said. “We’re try-
ing to figure out how to reduce the 
impact on students, staff and faculty 
as much as possible.”

TPS has said that it has a multi-
million dollar deficit and will run 
out of reserve funds and collapse in 
three years. The changes to buses 
and parking that were scheduled for 
July would have helped TPS close 
holes in its budget. A transporta-
tion workgroup, made up of students 
and members of Matthew’s staff, will 
be formed to address how to make 
changes that benefit both TPS, which 
operates without external funding, 
and students.

Le is a sitting undergraduate rep-
resentative on the Transportation 
Policy Committee but says she has 
not always been able to propose ideas 
and has instead served more of an 
advocacy role. She said she hopes 
to be able to introduce and imple-
ment alternative ideas in the new 
Transportation workgroup.

One such solution is the Triton 
Transit Pass, which would give all 
students access to all of MTS bus and 
light rail services but would require 
all students to buy into the program. 
The cost per student per year for 
the Triton Transit Pass, which would 
need to approved by way of a student 
referendum, would likely range from 
$100 from $140 a year, while the sub-

sidized MTS passes would cost $360 
for a September-to-June pass.

To gather student input and spread 
awareness on the now-tabled changes, 
Transportation Services held a stu-
dent town hall meeting on Feb. 12. 
Holden led the meeting, and a panel of 
TPS administrators was also present, 
including Principal Planner Robert 
Clossin and Berven. Approximately 
55 people attended the meeting, com-
posed of staff, faculty, students and 
A.S. Council. Several campus police 
officers were also present for crowd 
control.

Most of the meeting consisted of a 
PowerPoint presentation by Holden, 
during which he talked about the 
proposed transportation changes and 
the importance of feedback related 
to these changes. Holden emphasized 
the need for feedback during these 
transitions, saying that Transportation 
Services is looking to engage people 
and give them all opportunities to 
voice their concerns.

“There is no final decision, and 
that’s why I’m here,” Holden said. “I 
want to really try and find out what 
people are looking for. We’re not look-
ing for a for-profit situation; we’re 
looking to make sure we have what we 

want in the future.”
Holden also stated that TPS is 

looking for other sustainable alterna-
tives, including research grants for 
electric buses that can act as battery 
buffers for the campus and the incor-
poration of an electronic chip in ID 
cards to track usage of shuttles to elim-
inate unnecessary spending or abuse; 
there was mention of a possible trolley 
system in the future as well.

Students and faculty also had an 
opportunity to direct questions toward 
the panel, with many of their ques-
tions concerning the absorption of 
the Nobel and Arriba shuttles by MTS 
and TPS’s current efforts to service the 
large number of students along those 
routes.

“What we need to guarantee is 
that we can follow up with MTS to 
make sure that they are able to absorb 
the routes,” Holden said. “One of the 
groups that we met with suggested 
that we put up cues.”

Another town hall event for fac-
ulty and staff members will take place 
Feb. 21.

New Workgroup Will Focus on Proposing Alternate Changes to Close TPS Budget Gap

At last night’s A.S. Council meeting, my editors walked into the Forum just as I 
was inhaling chow mein goodness. 
Whoops. I promise I usually work 
while I’m here.

Public Input opened with an Ethio-
pian-Israeli speaker who came at the 
request of several councilmembers to 
talk about growing 
up in Israel. She 
was addressing the 
tensions brought 
on by VP External 
Affairs Olamide 
Noah’s controversial video, shown 
last week, depicting the alleged forced 
sterilization of Ethiopian immigrants 
living in Israel.

Ben Hass, president of Tritons 
for Israel, also spoke on the issue, 
condemning the video as malicious 
and bigoted.

Can we please just go back to talk-
ing about fee increases?

Triton Lobby Corps kicked off 
Special Presentations with an overview 
of its plans for the coming year. The 
fairly new organization will be holding 
biweekly meetings with district repre-
sentatives to discuss student interests, 
such as transportation. I hope this 
means that they will shortly procure 
saddled kangaroos for all students.

During the Lobby Corps’ presenta-
tion, Campuswide Senator Caeser 
Feng passed me a note from AVP 
College Affairs Leonard Bobbitt that 
simply said, “You should quote Leon-
ard Bobbitt. <3 Leonard Bobbitt.”

I probably would’ve quoted him 
eventually, “irregardless” of the note. 
You’re hilarious, Leonard!

Sean O’Neal, representing the 
Student Fee Advisory Commit-
tee, continued presentations with a 
Mario-themed Prezi regarding SFAC’s 
role on campus. He showed a helpful, 

if somewhat depressing, infographic 
regarding how student fees are distrib-
uted between the various clusters of 
student life.

And just when I thought Bobbitt 
had concluded his weekly words of 
wisdom, he came back fighting during 
reports of committees.

“We had our dodgeball event last 
weekend, which 
Muir College won,” 
he said, and with-
out missing a beat, 
continued, “And I 
believe all students 

should be equal in the eyes of the law.”
A.S. President Meggie Le reported 

that she received a letter from the 
Anti-Defamation League regarding 
Noah’s video. She and Noah will write 
separate replies to the letter.

Le also announced that a meeting 
with Transportation Services resulted 
in quite a victory for students — the 
changes to transportation scheduled 
for July will no longer happen this 
summer. So for the time being, our 
shuttles, bus passes, and permit prices 
will stay put. Major kudos to Le and 
her committee.

Also in the realm of fantastic 
news, Campuswide Senator Matthew 
Mayeda reported that the deadline 
to submit fee increases for UC SHIP, 
originally slated for March 1, will now 
be pushed back to April.

“The quick-and-dirty about 
healthcare is that one side wants to 
try and help everyone, while the other 
thinks we should only help ourselves,” 
Mayeda said. “We’ll be hosting a town 
hall meeting Tuesday from 5 to 6:30 
p.m. to inform students about what’s 
going on.

And finally, Caeser fed me blue-
berry yogurt pretzels, and the meeting 
was over by 7:59 p.m. This was the best 
A.S. Council meeting ever.

SFAC Visits Council; SHIP 
Increases May Be Delayed

“Not all UC campuses offer the 
same medical options,” she said. “With 
any of these plans, we lose our autono-
my over our own insurance.”

Mayeda added that one of the best 
solutions included making it more dif-
ficult for students to opt out of SHIP, 
thereby ensuring a lower cost through 
a larger population. Nuth recommend-
ed eliminating vision and dental care 
to prevent further price increases.

A secondary problem in the UC 

SHIP system is the presence of lifetime 
caps, which will be phased out under 
President Barack Obama’s Affordable 
Care Act. 

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue stated that it would take 
a minimum price increase of $30 per 
student per quarter to lift the lifetime 
caps on UCSD’s current plan.

Rue also supported students who 
rely on SHIP.

“It is the stance of all the vice chan-
cellors that students should not have to 
take on all this debt,” she said. “It was 

an institutional mistake.”
UCOP will make its final decisions 

about SHIP premium costs and file 
changes in April of this year. Nuth and 
Mayeda claimed that the announce-
ment of the deficit and its quick turn-
around time was surprising.

“This process has always been 
rushed, and there was no transpar-
ency,” Mayeda said. “It was kind of a 
bomb dropped on us.”

Cuts to Vision and Dental Coverage May Prevent Some Fee Increases

Softball, Track and Field Stadiums Unveil 
New Permanent Seats, Video Scoreboard

New improvements to the 
Triton Track and Field and Softball 
Stadiums may help the venues to 
become future hosts to more major 
events, such as tournaments and 
NCAA post-season events.

Plans to install a massive new 
scoreboard for the Track and Field 
Stadium first came in 2009 when 
news of the death of alumni and 
two-time NCAA discus throw and 
shot put champion Shannon Quigley 
Runningbear first reached those in 
the UCSD track and field circle.

Not long after that, pole-vaulter 
Leon Roach died in a tragic pole-
vaulting accident during practice. 
The tribute to Runningbear was 
temporarily suspended as Roach’s 
family coordinated family, friends 
and members of the track and field 
community to create a new terrace 
by the pole-vaulting area, made 

entirely through volunteer effort at 
no cost to the students.

Now, four years later, with 90 
percent of the funds raised through 
donation, the 20-by-15 foot score-
board has been completed. The addi-
tion of the scoreboard, estimated to 
be worth nearly $400,000, will allow 
athletes and audience members alike 
to view race results immediately, 
giving UCSD a better chance of 
hosting more major track and field 
events.

“We’re hosting the Cal-Nevada 
championships, which is 30 to 40 
schools in March, and it’ll have 
nearly all the Big West teams,” men’s 
track and field Head Coach Tony 
Salerno said. “Hosting Division-II 
nationals is on the horizon; I think 
it’ll happen in the next few years.”

Softball coach Patti Gerckens led 
the charge in the campaign to add 
new, permanent seats to the softball 
stadium in the seating bowl area 

behind home plate.
With a $250,000 donation from 

alumna Dana Chaiken, the softball 
stadium was renovated with new 
dugouts, a netted backstop and a 
fencing and press box in 2010. Last 
week, 313 chair back seats were 
added to the seating bowl. The 
chairs will be funded by a campaign 
that allows people to purchase seats 
and have their names engraved onto 
the seat backs.

“It really adds to the look and 
feel of the facility — it’s already a 
first-class facility, but it just takes it 
to another level,” Senior Associate 
Athletic Director Ken Grosse said. 
“It allows us to give a much bet-
ter fan experience, and it’ll give us 
an opportunity to attract high-level 
tournaments like NCAA regionals 
and nationals.”

Officials hope the new equipment will increase odds of hosting tournaments.

On Feb. 25, UC Office of the President will finalize its plan to combat the UC-wide Student Health Insurance Plan 
(SHIP) debt, and UCSD students will be left to 
pick up the pieces. The SHIP deficit of $49 mil-
lion was caused by institutional mistakes and 
has affected all UC schools, but UCSD owes the 
most — with over 27 percent of the debt on its 
shoulders alone. UCOP has recently proposed 
possible ways to help offset the debt — from 
cutting dental and vision plans from SHIP, to 
making it even more difficult to waive SHIP 
in favor of an alternate health insurance plan. 
Another proposition would be to double the 
price of SHIP premiums over the course of 
only five years. 

And all of this should leave UCSD 
students — particularly those who rely on 
SHIP benefits — with the same questions: 
What do we do now, and how did we get here in the first place? The answer to 
the first question is, at least partially, certain: SHIP prices will increase. Whether 
it’s by 97 percent over the next five years according to one proposed plan or 
the next two years as yet another plan proposes, the comfy price of $385.46 a 
quarter for undergraduates and $594 for graduates will be no more. While these 
plans may be more fiscally reasonable than the admittedly cheap SHIP premi-
ums, the price increase does raise problems. 

First, if the premium increase is in conjunction with cuts to benefits such as 

dental and vision care, students will be paying significantly more money for sig-
nificantly less coverage. Thus, student SHIP holders would be held accountable 
for mistakes made by the school. 

Similarly, if students have to jump through administrative hoops to prove 
that one has sufficient health care coverage (opting out of SHIP is already incon-
venient enough), UCSD would essentially be strong arming students into the 
SHIP program, which is now, again, less worthwhile than ever before. 

Just two weeks ago we wrote 
an editorial encouraging UCSD 
Transportation Services to consider 
other options and especially student 
input before proceeding with the 
proposed shuttle cuts. Now, things 
have changed (Such is news, right?). 
A.S. President Meggie Le announced 
yesterday that Vice Chancellor for 
Resource Management and Planning 
Gary Matthews has asked Director 
of Auxiliary Business Services 
Robert Holden to postpone the 
implementation of any changes so 
that we may have the time to discuss 
alternatives. Simply put: The shuttle 
cuts planned for July will not be 
happening. Yet.

But before you start hugging 
your shuttle driver and taking vic-
tory laps on the Arriba shuttle, 
realize the fight isn’t over. TPS’s 
debt hasn’t changed, and we still 
need a solution. 

For those evidently living under 
a rock: Last month, TPS announced 
a series of changes in response to 
the service’s multi-million dollar 
deficit, including an increase in 
parking costs in on-campus park-
ing structures and for all permits, 
the discontinuation of the free Bus 

Zone sticker system and the integra-
tion of the Arriba and Nobel shuttle 
lines into a more frequent MTS 
SuperLoop line.

A Facebook group was then 
formed to unite students against 
the changes and quickly grew to 
more than 7,000 members. After 
examining the concerns expressed 
by students on this group, Le and 
UC Student Association President 
Raquel Morales met with Matthews, 
TPS Assistant Director Todd 
Berven and Director of Auxiliary 
Business Services Robert Holden 
to share a list of demands which 
included paving over the Torrey 
Pines Gliderport for student-only 
parking, creating “S” parking 
spots by The Village, maintaining 
the current price for “S” parking 
permits and continuing the full 
subsidized MTS Bus Zone sticker 
program, among others.

In response to the demands 
introduced by Le and Morales, 
Matthews said the changes will not 
be put into place — instead, the 
administration will seek to establish 
a committee to discuss alternatives. 

That’s where the town halls and 
similar forums come into play. We 

need to turn the aforementioned 
demands into real, concrete solu-
tions we could potentially initiate. 
Though the changes are delayed, 
the threat of their implementation 
is not gone.

Le is already a sitting under-
graduate representative on the 
Transportation and Parking 
Committee but has served in more 
of an advocacy role. We hope that 
in this new subcommittee, she and 
other students will actually be able 
to introduce and implement alterna-
tive ideas.

Furthermore, we should also 
be thankful for Le and Morales’ 
leadership during this time — they 
represented the student body’s needs 
so that we wouldn’t have to resort 
to protests, and they were clearly 
successful in doing so. The 7,000 
members of the Facebook group — 
and the rest of the student body that 
these changes would affect — should 
make this delay worth the costs to 
TPS’s budget by attending future 
town hall meetings and remaining 
active in any online discussions of 
realistic alternatives. Only 55 people 
(approximately) attended Tuesday’s 
meeting, including A.S. Council. 

Unless we turn that number up, 
there’s no guarantee your ideas will 
be represented by Le and the others 
in the subcommittee.

Ever since Drake shot the infamous “YOLO” motto into pop fame, it has been used 
as an excuse for nearly everything: 
neglecting to study, pier-jumping, 
intoxicated driving … the list goes 
on and on. “You Only Live Once” 
certainly has mixed results — shy kids 
have become more enterprising, but 
the less fortunate have been killed 
in blind pursuit of this hedonistic 
maxim. So why are we so inclined to 
live life on the edge?

Research by Vanderbilt University 
professor David Zald has shown 
that thrill-seekers (the YOLO types) 
exhibit lower inhibitor counts 
for a certain neurotransmitter 
chemical than do average people. 
This chemical, called dopamine, 
rewards us with a physical sensation 
of satisfaction every time we do 
something we enjoy, like eating 
chocolate, going skydiving or getting 
a good grade. As a result of their 
inhibitor deficiency, the YOLO-ers’ 
brains experience unusual spikes 
in dopamine levels when they do 
something exciting. This causes that 
primal “on-edge” feeling when taking 
risks and teetering on the brink.

Our desire to “YOLO,” as used 
in its recently coined verb form, 
can also stem from less impulse-
driven desires. Take the “pursuit of 
happiness,” for example, as advocated 
by the Declaration of Independence. 
Sometimes, this happiness may mean 
flopping on our beds and doing 
absolutely nothing. On the whole, 
though, the feeling that we are taking 
full advantage of our ultimately short 
time on Earth is always gratifying.

Furthermore, we are raised 
with the notion that innovation 
and accomplishment come from 
risks — an idea substantiated by the 
success of everything from NASA’s 
moon landings to Mark Zuckerberg’s 
creation of Facebook. So while we 
probably shouldn’t jam forks into 
toasters, as YouTube sensation Jimmy 
Tatro does in his YOLO-themed 
video, there is a prevalent idea that 
pushing the boundaries of convention 
can lead to amazing things. Though 
most of us associate YOLO with 
reckless Red Bull-chugging idiots 
trying to rationalize poor decisions, 
the success of those who use the 
phrase to achieve great things gives 
the acronym more reputable meaning.

But before we throw caution to 
the wind in pursuit of precarious 
endeavors, we must consider the idea 
that if we only get one life, we should 
do everything possible to preserve 
it. This concept recently surfaced in 
comedy rap trio The Lonely Island’s 
“YOLO” parody music video, which 
changes the acronym to stand for  
“You Oughta Look Out.” The three 
prance around a nightclub with 
Adam Levine, paranoidly donning 
ear protectors and rapping that their 
“friends will be sorry when they can’t 
hear.” While the hashtag-friendly 
Twittersphere’s “live fast, die young” 
idea of the phrase is rather different, 
there is still the question of whether 
we should spend our life by playing 
it safe, or pushing the limits. Modern 
mindsets tend to choose the latter.

So when your irresponsible 
friends take you bungee jumping in 
Baja, consider that dopamine rush 
and decide what YOLO means for 
you. While you’re standing atop a 
cliff mulling that over, I’ll be busy 
scrutinizing my heater for gas leaks.

Move Over,
Carpe Diem: 
It’s Time 
to YOLO

Ladies, 
Keep Your 
PU$$Y 
P0PPIN

a t the risk of sounding like a cari-cature of myself, I was wary of writing this column. Somehow, 
“Dodging the Horizon” has turned 
into “Arielle Rambles About Feminism 
and Music” and seeing another 600 
or so words telling people how awe-
some and underrepresented female 
artists are might scream “Groundhog 
Day” to some readers. While I don’t 
think we can ever exhaust the feminist 
music criticism cannon, my column 
is supposed to be about pop music, 
and there are plenty of men doing 
that well too these days. (Frank Ocean 
won a Grammy! Justin Timberlake 
has a new song that sounds like an old 
R. Kelly song!)

With that said, there’s something 
more important in my life I need to 
talk about, and it’s all about pussy. 

“PU$$Y P0PPIN” is the name of 
a radio show on KSDT that I’m co-
hosting with my friend Mina. We go 
by the names DJ Minamator and DJ 
Ari$ha, and play nothing but female 
hip hop from 4 to 5 p.m. every Friday. 

Mina approached me with the idea 
for the show over winter break, and I 
couldn’t resist immediately making a 
sprawling Spotify playlist of lady MCs 
and agreeing to the gig. Since then, 
I’ve discovered more incredible artists 
than I could have possibly imagined. 
Last week’s theme of “up and comers” 
and this week’s theme of “female rap-
pers from around the world,” forced 
me to delve deep into the pockets of 
the Internet to pull out women that I 
probably wouldn’t have been exposed 
to otherwise. 

I see plenty of people who claim 
to be fans of rap who don’t listen to a 
single female, and those that do often 
pit them against each other, sexualize 
them or treat them like a gimmick. 
Let the following artists be a taste of 
what female rappers really have to 
offer, and listen to PU$$Y P0PPIN 
every Friday for even more girl power.

Kitty (formerly Kitty Pryde)
On her new release “D.A.I.S.Y. 

Rage,” Kitty goes where few female 
MCs have gone before, rapping about 
wetting the bed, her relationship with 
her mother and even twisting Wu 
Tang’s C.R.E.A.M. into a confessional 
about anxiety rashes. Unlike artists of 
the old guard like Lil Kim and Foxy 
Brown, sex isn’t her central premise. 
Kitty doesn’t shy away from the topic 
either, but it’s merely one facet of her 
complicated experience as a teenage 
girl — a group that ordinarily gets 
objectified by the mainstream media.

The 19-year-old’s delivery is 
subversive by traditional hip hop 
standards. As she giggles mid song, 
and delivers her rhymes like a truth 
or dare confession, it’s easy to see why 
a hip hop traditionalist might write 
her off as a disrespectful wannabe. 
Admittedly, the Kitty Pryde project 
did start as a bored joke on Kathryn 
Beckwith’s laptop, but once she found 
fame with her video for “Okay Cupid” 
there was no turning back. Pretentious 
(male) hip hop heads shouldn’t dis-
count her merely for speaking in a 
voice they can’t relate to.

The U.K. Ladies
For years, British hip-hop and its 

dark, twisted child, grime, have been 
completely dominated by men like 
Tinie Tempah and Dizzee Rascal, with 
the most successful women (such as 
Lady Sovereign), falling by the way-
side almost as soon as they appear. 
Fortunately, there’s now a group of 
badass ladies leading the charge in the 
UK, including Lady Leshurr, Amplify 
Dot, No Lay and Shystie. 

Lady Leshurr has an intricate, 
lightning-quick delivery reminiscent

The Witching Hour
BY  Pablo  valdivia  Staff Writer

Astorm of drums fills the theater. Jonathan Pratt, the play’s composer and exposed 
percussionist, delivers pulse-pounding 
beats that makes finding your seat 
fantastically epic. Suddenly, we see 
three men. They are the Brothers Size 
— the protagonists and namesake of 
the second in Tarell Alvin McCraney’s 
“Brothers/Sisters” series and a con-
tinuation of his focus on community 
and family. 

Elegba’s (Antwayn Hooper) throat 
produces angst-ridden song as he 
dances around Oshoosi (Okieriete 
Onaodowan) whose body writhes on 
a bed of rocks. There are no props; the 
only evidence of the shovel in Ogun’s 
hands are his exasperated gestures and 
the stage directions, which he dictates 
aloud. There is no scenery to indicate 
that the characters live in an impover-
ished,  modern-day neighborhood in 
Louisiana. Ogun (Joshua Elijah Reese) 
finishes his shoveling, picks up his 
bucket, and circles Oshoosi, the sand 
from his perforated bucket forming a 
ring around the younger Size brother. 
The dramatic introduction is a mere 
sampling of some of the striking, 
occasionally overzealous mysticism 
intertwined in this otherwise realistic 
and gritty story.

Oshoosi Size has just been released 
from prison and takes up residence 

with his older brother, Ogun. Ogun, 
the hard-working mechanic, pries his 
brother to get up, get going, and get 
a job. As expected, Elegba is the bad 
influence external to the family, the 
residual of Oshoosi’s time in prison 
and the looming possibility of future 
poor (or maybe just a little confused) 
choices.

In almost every scene, Elegba and 
Ogun stand opposite with Oshoosi 
in the middle.  It’s the tried and true 
formula of placing one character 
between two others, one represent-
ing the polar opposite of the other. 
The dream sequences were just an 
excessive conveyance of this famil-
iar plot device. However, too few 
times have such circumstances been 
captured in a modern setting on the 
stage and through creative use of 
stage directions and sand, McCraney 
makes classic story devices compel-
ling again. Elegba, erotically drawn 
towards Oshoosi and his “siren voice,” 
teeters outside the sand circle, entic-
ing Oshoosi to breach its bounds and 
come outside of it with him.

The characters may take their 
names from the Yoruban gods but 
they play familiar figures. The south-
ern vernacular slides smoothly off 
their tongues. Okieriete, Joshua, and 
Antwayn are flawless in their dialogue 
and it feels as if Ogun and Oshoosi 

are our brothers and Elegba is the 
shady face from our own past. As the 
action progresses, the complexity of 
the different relationships is revealed 
and we begin to understand why 
Ogun and Oshoosi’s brotherhood is 
so strained.

Pratt’s drumset is a force to be 
reckoned with. Appropriate dings and 
pounds punctuate an eyebrow raise or 
a smile in a rather cartoonish fashion, 
making for some humorous moments. 
Tempo and volume also aide to build 
emotion in several scenes, imitat-
ing the physiological process of both 

the audience and actors, simulating 
quickening heartbeats and heavy 
breathing. Both the actors’ and Pratt’s 
timing are effortless. On a few occa-
sions, a rhythmic underlayer accom-
panies the actors’ rich voices, turning 
monologues into a slice of song that 
drives home the angst, joy, and frus-
tration the characters feel.

The unflinching juxtaposition of 
comedy and tragedy is bold. Some of 
the older audience members seemed 
uncomfortable with certain moments 

Hollywood’s newest necromancers explore the film that might cast them into the spotlight (or the B-list).

dodging  the  
horizon

Move over, bloodsuckers. This is the year of the caster. 
“Beautiful Creatures” is a new 

movie based on the best-selling 
novels, “The Caster Chronicles,” by 
Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl. 
With a cast of both new and sea-
soned actors (Viola Davis, Jeremy 
Irons and Emma Thompson, to 
name a few), “Creatures” attempts 
to fill the paranormal void that the 
cultural phenomenon “Twilight” 
left behind. Stars Alice Englert and 
Alden Ehrenreich sat down with the 
Guardian to discuss their take on the 
film, its message and what it means 
to be a witch in a very mortal world.

Alice Englert is a poised 18-year-
old Australian actress who’s been 
exposed to the industry all her life. 
Alden Ehrenreich is a 23-year-old 
NYU alum who was discovered by 
Steven Spielberg at age 14. With 
this movie set to be their first big-
budget film, a lot rides on the way in 
which they face this typically over-
wrought genre. Although “Beautiful 
Creatures” may sound like a shoddy 
“Twilight” remake, both actors rec-
ommend not making hasty assump-
tions about the cliched synopsis like 
they initially did. 

“We both passed on it when we 
just heard the brief without reading 
the script — that was literally the 
kind of brief we got … Once we both 
read the scripts, we really wanted to 
do it,” Englert said.

Apparently, the writers weren’t 
too impressed either. Even the film’s 
title ended up on the cutting room 
floor.

“‘Beautiful Creatures’ references 
a line that got cut from the movie, 
but it’s in the book, and it actually 
references human beings,” Englert 
said. “Jeremy Irons talks about how 
human beings are such beautiful 
creatures because they have faith 

with no reason, and he finds this 
baffling and also endearing.”

Both actors speak fondly of the 
allure and importance that the main 
characters, Lena Duchannes and 
Ethan Wate, bring to the film.

“[Lena is] a young girl on the 
verge of her 16th birthday … she’s 
traveled around, she’s had not-great 
experiences, she’s pretty cagey and 
she wants to just stop for a second; 
she wants to know, she wants to be 
human, she wants to be normal, she 
doesn’t even know how to be normal 
— there’s a total gap between what 
she wants and the reality of where 
she can go with it,” Englert said.

While attempting to find normal-
ity as a witch in a mortal-dominated 
world, Lena finds Ethan.

“I’m a young guy in this small 
town who’s just dying to get out of 

this town and has these romantic 
visions of what he wanted — the 
kind of life he wants for himself 
— and when I meet Lena … she 
embodies all those, all the excite-
ment and all the adventure that I 
have been thinking I needed to leave 
the town to find, and we fall in love 
and then have to fight against these 
supernatural forces of her family to 
stay together,” Ehrenreich said.

Several renowned, award-
winning actors are also part of this 
production and take a page from the 
dark side to do so.

“[The supernatural forces come] 
in the form of Emma Thompson 
and Emmy Rossum, who are the 
naughty, bad side of my family and 
who are very keen to make Lena 
dip over there … I thought that was 
really great, the way Richard brought 

that work to the family aspect … a 
supernatural sort of mafia in a way, 
getting pulled into the gang,” Englert 
said. “I think a lot of families want 
their children to live the way they 
lived, because they’re afraid that if 
they live a different way, it under-
mines the way they lived their lives 
… I think that was really exciting for 
me, seeing Lena have to break away 
from that.” 

The banter between the two 
actors is extremely casual, and 
the friendly in-person chemistry 
between the two translated well to 
the screen. Their candid relationship 
allowed for a certain self-awareness 
when comparing themselves to their 
characters.

vocal gymnastics on the title track of 
Orbital’s comeback album, “Wonky.” 
Meanwhile, London’s Amplify Dot 
drops punch line verses over mania-
cal club bangers with vocals that are 
indisputably hard. Give her glitchy 
throwdown “Semantics” a spin at the 
gym. Fellow Londoner No Lay falls on 
the grimier side of the spectrum, with 
a delivery that’s sometimes reminis-
cent of the wild tone changes of Nicki 
Minaj in her prime. (Check “Below 
Zero” for the best example.) Finally, 
Shystie is probably the most similar 
to the Queen, Missy Elliot, toting the 
same high-throttle energy and shout-
along choruses. (“Feel It” sounds 
alarmingly like “Work It”-era Missy.) 

Salome MC
Salome MC is the first female hip 

hop artist in Iran, which denounced 
the genre back in 2007. Despite the 
evident restrictions of a regime that 
controls the release and performance 
of music, Salome hasn’t been discour-
aged from recording tracks privately 
in her bedroom and releasing them 
online. The poetic nature of Farsi, 
coupled with her forceful delivery, 
makes for an instantly compelling 
sound — even if you can’t understand 
a word that she’s saying. 

Fortunately, the Internet can help.
“I haven’t seen the revolution, but 

my rap is revolutionary; This pen 
is my weapon, and I got my burial 
shroud in my backpack,” reads the 
translation of a verse in last year’s 
single “Drunk Shah, Drunk Elder.”

Now, if that’s not badass enough to 
pique your interest, you don’t deserve 
to be graced by the PU$$Y.

Identity Thief ” looked promis-ing, but looks can be deceiv-ing. Family man and financial 
officer Sandy Patterson (Jason 
Bateman) has not only become vic-
tim to a stolen identity, but his boss 
and terrible friend Casey (played 
by the clearly much younger John 
Cho) has no understanding what-
soever for this very common, very 
real crime. He gives Sandy a week 
to prove that he is not purchasing 
jet-skis and missing court dates 
in Florida. Sandy then makes the 
kind of decision only permissible 
in comedy movies and resolves to 
travel across the country to wrangle 
a potentially dangerous criminal 
and drag her back to Denver. After 
he convinces the identity thief to 
come with him, he realizes that 
they cannot get on a plane while 
sharing the same name and they 
are forced to make a longer, much 
more hilarious trip back home. 

“Identity Thief ” is a road-trip 
comedy that had the guts to go to 
new places but fell disappointedly 
short of its potential. 

As Diana the identity thief, 
Melissa McCarthy is not only the 
driving force of most of the film’s 
big laughs, but a beauty as well. 
Diana’s metallic makeup and bright 
outfits are an extension of her 
bubbly personality. She is a thief 
and an unscrupulous spender, but 

she comes across as charming and 
resourceful — especially next to 
Sandy, who assumes the role of 
the uptight, average Joe. Moreover, 
Diana is not shy about expressing 
her healthy sexual appetite. This 
made for some raunchy moments, 
but it was a progressive change 
from her role in “Bridesmaids” 
in which McCarthy’s aggressive 
sexual expression was supposed 
to be funny because she is a large 
woman. In “Identity Thief,” the 
humorous irony stems from Diana’s 
fearlessness and street smarts 
which make her more competent at 
achieving Sandy’s goal than Sandy 
himself.

While other critics lampooned 
the film’s sentimentality, learn-
ing about Diana and watching her 
vacillate between unabashed confi-
dence and resigned insecurity was 
one of the more interesting sub-
plots. This was a great opportunity 
to have Diana clearly express how 
she felt about herself at the end of 
the film, thereby fully developing 
the character and resolving this 
conflict. Sadly, “Identity Thief ” 
could not decide how it felt about 
its most interesting character.

In one pivotal scene, Diana is 
in a high-end salon, gaily trying 
on products when she realizes the 
trendy, slim makeup artists are 
laughing at her. They look away, 

ashamed that they have been dis-
covered, as does she. When she 
turns on her heels and makes a 
B-line for the shallow ditzes, it 
seems an intense tell-off scene is 
about to ensue. Instead, Diana 
meekly declares, “I need help.” The 
ditzes turn Diana into an Adele-
look-alike, clad in a black dress and 
neutral tone makeup which causes 
her to fade in the background, 
where Hollywood apparently feels 
the larger women belong. This 
infuriating scene was the worst 
transgression of the film but cer-
tainly not the only one.

Diana is a wanted woman. An 
imprisoned crime lord appears (for 
fifteen seconds) to order her death 
because he clearly cannot priori-
tize. The protagonists are pursued 
by the gang leader’s underlings 

(Genesis Rodriguez and T.I.) who 
become the subject of a bad joke 
about “traditional neighborhoods” 
because of their ethnic identities. 
A skiptracer (Robert Patrick), 
hired by an inappropriately relaxed 
female voice (whose owner is never 
revealed), also seeks out Diana.

While “Identity Thief ” was for 
the most part a predictable com-
edy movie, it dodged other holes. 
Bateman executed some of the 
humor on his own, and there’s an 
underlying commentary on the 
bureaucratic process somewhere. 
But if such a message is in the film, 
it is buried under the goofy mis-
steps and occasional comic sucker-
punches.

The 5 Kinds of Valentine’s Day Dates
BY  vi ncent Pham  Staff writer

I’m going to be honest with you guys — I am undeniably single. And yet I’m writing about the most romantic hol-iday known to Hallmark, and you’re probably questioning my credibility. Let me tell you a little something. This singleness? It only drives my fuel for romance and for wanting happiness in my life — so much so that I want 
happiness in your life. If I can’t be happy, it doesn’t mean anyone else can’t. I’ve channeled all this excess love into this 
article so that maybe on the Feb. 14, you won’t be so down and out. Here we are on a voyage of love.

the  Freshman  date 

The Most Romantic Place on 
Campus: You guessed it, the Bistro 
Places You Can Reach on Foot 
(for him/her): Sprinkles
Places You Can Reach on Foot 
(as a couple): The Cliffs/Glider 
Port

You’re a freshman, she’s a freshman, 
and somebody wants to get laid tonight. 
You want to impress her but you’re also 
cheap because you bought all of your 
textbooks brand new, and you figure 
dining dollars isn’t really money. You go 
ahead and book yourself a table for two at 
the Bistro for the 14th. What? It’s booked? 
I guess it’s just another casual dinner at 
the next best dining hall on campus — 
Pines. And before all of this, you’re going 
to walk your ass on over to Sprinkles 
and pick her up an aphrodisiac cupcake 
(chocolate) as you sit on the Cliffs or 
Gliders Port and scarf it down for a chilly 
night of hand holding and smooching.

the  Long  distance  date

How to Get to There: Two Words: 
iPhone Parachute
The “You’re the Best Factor”: 
Gather single friends, and use them as 
your Cupids
The Alternative: Hold it off.

The chances that you’ll be able to fly/
train/drive over to your significant other isn’t 
always the most plausible option (because 
Valentine’s Day decided to test your love by 
putting itself in the middle of the quarter 
and in the middle of the week), but technol-
ogy now a days proves effective nonetheless. 
What’re you going to do? Get your friend 
who knows your girlfriend to parachute 
down an iPhone (that is secure in the most 
advanced cushioning; think “Egg Drop” 
from your Physics class) while you’re on it, 
FaceTiming, for you to surprise her. Does it 
get better? You bet your ass it does. If your 
significant other is in an area where you have 
a fair amount of friends, have them bring the 
date to her — candlelit dinner and roses will 
be fine here.

Don’t know his/her friends? Order some 
local take out and send it over, and Skype 
over the meal.

If this planning is a little too much for 
short notice, there is nothing like postpon-
ing the date until a more convenient time.

the  table  for  one  date

Self Appreciation

Let’s face it: A lot of us didn’t expect to be alive in 2013, so you broke it off with your 
significant other before Doomsday. You’re single, and you don’t have a Valentine this year 
while all your friends do. There is a chance you might be alone, but don’t fret. Keep in 
mind many less popular date hot spots will be to your disposal, and you will have the true 
freedom of a single person. Go out on a hike, read a good book, and sip on a cup of coffee. 
The day is yours.

u Break up with him/her. Unless 
you have a sick sense of humor and 
get back with him/her the same day. 
This is similar to breaking up with 
someone on their birthday.
u Take him/her to McDonald’s. 
Although, this could be the premise 
to a more fabulous date. Or you 
really are that cheap, and I hope your 
significant other considers cutting 
some ties.

u Ask him/her to be your 
Valentine. Like, don’t goof it up.
u Do something involving an 
inside joke. Be personal, and show 
your lover you put time and effort 
into the day.
u His/Her gifts? Only if they’re 
matching onesies.
u Snuggle with her. Hard.

Objectively, Valentine’s Day is just another day in the week. There is no religious affinity; there is no great trag-edy or victory we are to commemorate. If you really want to be sweet, genuine, sincere and all that good stuff that everyone would fall for, treat Valentine’s Day as just another day of you expressing your affection — and 
keep the love coming daily, nightly and ever so rightly. Because everyday can be Valentine’s Day, and it’s up to you to 
make it happen. Keep it clean, keep it real, and keep it fresh, because your lover only deserves the best.

the  classic  date

Venue: Balboa Park, 1549 El Prado, 
San Diego, CA 92101
The Aphrodisiac: Kous Kous, 3940 
4th Ave., San Diego, CA 92103

The “Aw” Factor: Skip the roses. Go for 
creativity.

If you’re fortunate to have a car, you 
have all of San Diego at your disposal, 
and you don’t want to be that guy who 
says the Bistro is your idea of romantic. 
A cute date would be soaking in some 
culture and leaving your mark all over the 
art in the museums at Balboa Park and 
then heading over to Hillcrest for an inti-
mate dinner at the Moroccan Kous Kous. 
Roses and jewelry may imply you didn’t 
have any ideas for a sentimental gift, 
so instead put some thought behind it. 
Spring for something like an inside joke 
between the two of you — the creativity 
and cute laughs will be something that’ll 
you’ll cherish much more.

If you’re stuck to strictly La Jolla...
The More Accessible Idea: Eat at 

Brockton Villa Restaurant (1235 Coast 
Blvd., La Jolla, CA 92037), and head over 
to La Jolla Cove or Mt. Soledad for a 
romantic sunset.

the  Best  Friend  date

Social Activity: UltraZone Live 
Action Laser Tag, 3146 Sports Arena 
Blvd., Suite 21, San Diego, CA 92110 
Dinner: Stacked, 7007 Friars Road, 
San Diego, CA 92108

The more the merrier. Get all of your 
friends who share your lack of a Valentine, 
and enjoy each other’s company. Bash the 
“holiday,” and mock couples who are sup-
posedly “in love” for your own enjoyment. 
Head out to a few rounds of laser tag, or 
even the San Diego Zoo, and then finish 
off your adventures with a stomach filled 
with your very own customized burger at 
Stacked. People tend to joke about those 
long walks on the beach at night. But have 
they ever done it? Probably not. So you 
will — with all your friends. Pack up some 
warm blankets, firewood, s’mores and 
your closest companions for a memorable 
night at La Jolla Shores in the middle of 
February. Nothing ignites love like the 
obligatory cuddle in the cold weather.

Alternatively, for all you single ladies: 
Galentine’s Day. Nothing says strong, inde-
pendent women like you and your closest 
girlfriends drinking some wine and eating 
chocolate while you tell your funniest sto-
ries. Want better? Male Stripclub. Having 
a bromantic Evening? Try s’mores at the 
shores.

The Guardian asked 

bartender Jef Cummings 
from Hillcrest’s Babycakes 

bar to recommend a 
Valentine’s Day drink. This 

was his choice.

Despite the hard liquor, this 
drink stays sweet and pink, 

with a refreshing hint of 
pineapple. Make a Pink kiss, 
drink a Pink kiss, and who 

knows — maybe by the end 
of the night, you’ll get a kiss.

because at the end, everyone will be 
drinking a lot of free beer. The found-
er, Ben Vaughan, created this event in 
view of the fact that this is a strictly 
fun and funding event. Head out with 
a partner, with family or go single. 
Either way, your contribution will be 
greatly appreciated by the Islander 
Sports and Stephen J. Wampler 
Foundations. By participating in the 

Coronado 10K, not only will you be 
contributing to great causes, you will 
be showing your sweetheart your 
charitable side.

“A lot of races don’t put quality to 
the event but we do,” Vaughan said.

All participants will receive a 
T-shirt, a finisher’s medal, a water bot-
tle and a booklet of coupons includ-
ing $30 off at Skydive San Diego and 
many more savings at local businesses.

“The coupons will alone pay for 

your ticket to participate,” Vaughan 
said.

So join your fellow San Diegans 
on Sunday, Feb. 17 at 8 a.m. by regis-
tering online. Importantly, be one of 
the first 50 students to use the code 
“UCSD” at checkout and save seven 
dollars. The cost to participate will 
vary by age but don’t forget, the top 
three male and female winners will be 
awarded with a cash prize. On top of 
that, if you are of legal age, there will 

be a post-race party, which will be 
held at McP’s Irish Pub and Grill with 
live music by Mystique, where beer by 
Gordon Biersch will be provided to 
satisfy your running needs. Let loose, 
and enjoy the Coronado 10K, because 
after all the fun and alcohol you’ll be 
having, your Valentine just might turn 
into something sweet. 

“her pleasure” after all) I found them 
terrible in practice. In fact, we had to 
stop part way through and change to 
something more standard in order 
to allow me time to recover. Even 
at slow speeds, all those dots work 
like sandpaper on your insides, and I 
can’t be the only person that doesn’t 
enjoy being gutted by my prophy-
lactics. I’m sure there are people that 
disagree and power to them, but for 
a Valentine’s night, I wouldn’t recom-
mend taking the risk.

Next is one of the high points 
though: ribbed condoms. I have to 
admit I was a little hesitant; feel-
ing it (with my hands, mind you) 
as I put it on my partner in this 
research project, it seemed like it 
had the potential to be as unpleasant 
as the dotted texture. But this was 
something I was excited to be wrong 
about. Of all the textured condoms 

we tried, the ribbed variety was far 
and away the best. Be sure the rib-
bing is wide, in order to avoid that 
awful scratching feeling that the 
narrower bands and the “dots” from 
above can cause. This type definitely 
hit highest on the pleasure scale for 
me, and I found I was able to reach 
orgasm the most quickly with it. If 
you try nothing else, try these.

We also picked up a few flavored 
condoms. I went for strawberry, 
mostly because I was concerned that 
grape or cherry might end up tast-
ing like cough medicine. These are 
flavored to improve the experience 
of performing protected oral sex (as 
I have yet to meet someone that can 
taste with their genitals). While I’m 
in a monogamous relationship, and 
we’re both free of STIs, I decided 
gamely to give them a shot anyway. 
(For science!) Bottom line: It still 
tasted like latex with strawberry 
smeared on top. But it’s definitely 

better than having a regular condom 
in your mouth, and having a few of 
these on hand for unexpected fellatio 
can’t hurt.

This next one was something 
we were both excited to try: Trojan 
Fire & Ice brand condoms. They 
had those commercials that made it 
seem like wearing this condom was 
akin to riding a roller coaster, so 
they had to be good. Unfortunately, 
like the dotted ones, these were also 
a dud, and I felt betrayed by adver-
tising once again. They definitely 
got hot, but it wasn’t a thrilling sen-
sation at all — just burning in places 
that I firmly believe should not be 
burned. My partner was less per-
turbed by it than I was, but he said 
it didn’t add much for him either 
way. We were willing to give them 
another try — because I wanted a 
roller coaster experience damn it — 
but the results remained the same. 
Internet reviews seem torn between 

my side of the fence and the lucky 
folks that made it on the thrill ride, 
so use at your own risk.

The grand finale, the ones that I 
had spent most of my time looking 
forward to: glow in the dark! They 
did not disappoint. They came in 
clear packages so they could be left 
under a light for a few minutes in 
advance (built-in foreplay time). 
Then lights out and boom — light 
saber. Functionally the same as a 
regular lubricated condom, they 
added an element of silliness that 
I’m fond of. And he appreciated 
that they afford a very unique visual 
even when the room is completely 
dark. Highly recommended.

Most all of these condoms 
should be available wherever a vari-
ety are sold, though some — like the 
glow in the dark — might be easier 
to find at an actual sex shop. Mix 
and match to try something new 
this Valentine’s, for cheap.

Finding the 
Right Fit: A 
Condom 
Review 

i t’s Valentine’s Day, and as a result That’s What She Said is here to try and add a bit of variety to your 
sex life. I wanted to come up with 
something that would help people 
celebrate the famous day of love, but 
that wasn’t going to break the bank 
or be subject to any delays, seeing 
as there would be no time to wait 
by the mailbox consumed with lust. 
As a result, I had to throw out com-
mentary on anything battery oper-
ated that might (or might not, if you 
have bad luck) be arriving in discreet 
packaging. To that end, I settled 
on something you can purchase in 
person and on a college student’s 
budget: condoms.

There are approximately two 
bazillion different types of condoms, 
and they all offer something differ-
ent. Well, to a degree, considering at 
the end of the day they’re all around 
to prevent the making of babies and 
the spreading of germs — but the 
forms they take are many. For those 
out there who are tired of the same 
ol’ Lifestyles (helpfully sold on cam-
pus), there are wide horizons ahead 
for those willing to head somewhere 
off campus to find a wider variety 
of condoms. Sex shops usually have 
buckets of mix-and-max deals on 
condoms available, and I took a 
few of each in order to conduct my 
research. And now, for the break-
down.

The first is the baseline: ordinary, 
run-of-the-mill lubricated condoms. 
They’re the easiest to find and gener-
ally the cheapest. They come in the 
super-thin variety too (but being 
totally honest, a condom’s a condom 
and thin or not, you’re going to 
know it’s there). I can’t personally 
recommend going for the unlubri-
cated variety, even though the pit-
tance of a price might be tempting. It 
always helps to have something extra 
to smooth the way.

In my daring field research, my 
partner and I decided to try the “dot-
ted” texture condoms first of the lot. 
As excited as we were, these imme-
diately put a damper on the mood. 
While interesting in theory (because 
these little dots were designed for

sushi  mura

restaurant    review

t he dark wooden furnishing of Sushi Mura is fitting of the cozy feel of Liberty Station. The 
restaurant is not cluttered with tra-
ditional Japanese artwork or cheesy, 
framed photos of sushi rolls — which 
isn’t as uncommon as one might 
think. Instead, the place is tasteful, 
with a single image of two Koi fish 
hanging toward the back and a flat-
screen television angled in a corner 
to face patrons. The tables are clean 
with black cloth napkins folded into 
a pocket to hold a set of smooth 
chopsticks. The soy sauce is not in an 
easily accessible bottle placed at each 
table. Apparently it is not the ordi-
nary Kikkoman, because it is poured 
personally into a small ceramic plate. 
The special concoction taste very 
similar to any other soy sauce, but it 
has a slightly muted flavor of less salt. 

Like the restaurant’s decor, the 
menu is simplified into one page, 
front and back. The appetizers are 
separated by serving temperature 
of hot or cold. Some of the items 

are typical of any sushi eatery, for 
example: edamame ($3), gyoza ($5), 
mixed tempura ($8) and fried cala-
mari ($6). However the Crispy Tuna 
Tartare ($15), tuna tartare topped 
with soft shell crab and drizzled with 
a spicy ginger sauce or the Salmon 
Tartare ($13), served with caviar, jala-
peno and fried, sliced lotus root (also 
known as renkon chips) call for a 
more sophisticated palette. The more 
common House Garden Salad ($5) is 
composed of mixed greens, a pile of 
grated carrots and tomatoes dressed 
with a light ginger vinaigrette. The 
dressing was just the right amount of 
tangy flavor, although the tomatoes 
were too sparse in the bed of lettuce. 

On the back of the menu, the 
sushi is also divided between clas-
sic and special rolls. The classic rolls 
range from $6 to $13 and include 
favorites like the Shrimp Tempura 
Roll ($7), California Roll ($9) and 
Rainbow Roll ($13). Out of the six 
special roll options, five consist of 
spicy ingredients, whether it is a 

sauce or the addition of jalapenos. 
The Southern Tataki ($16) is filled 
with shrimp tempura, imitation crab, 
cucumber and avocado and topped 
with seared tuna, jalapeno and a gar-
lic ponzu sauce. The lightly breaded 
deep fried tempura shrimp in addi-
tion to the crunchy jalapeno delivers 
a satisfying crunch. The seared tuna 
adds a nice smoky flavor that compli-
ments the spiciness of the jalapeno. 
The La Playa ($14) is made up of 
salmon, cream cheese, imitation crab, 
cilantro and of course — more jala-
peno layered with avocado, renkon 
chips, eel sauce and spicy mayo. The 
renkon chips also creates a nice bite 
to the typically softer texture. The 
cilantro carries a bright flavor with 
hints of citrus to play off the thick 
sweetness of the cream cheese. Both 
the Southern Tataki and La Playa 
rolls are thoughtfully balanced with 
unexpected ingredients. The specially 
crafted soy sauce concoction works 
well not to mask the other flavorful 
elements. The waiters were prompt 

and made sure that the cool cucum-
ber water and special soy sauce were 
always filled. 

In addition the menu offers sev-
eral chicken, beef or salmon entrees 
that are served alongside rice, miso 
soup and salad ($8 to $18). There 
are also two udon noodle options 
that both include mushroom, sweet 
tofu and fish cake ($10). Due to 
the concise menu, Sushi Mura is 
not recommended to the non-sushi 
lovers — because there’s just not 
much else to choose from. However, 
for those who can appreciate raw 
fish, Sushi Mura is definitely a 
place worth trying out. The Liberty 
Station area exudes a quiet charm 
that is perfect for a relaxed din-
ner out. The food at Sushi Mura 
is thoughtfully composed of bold 
flavors, unique textures and fresh 
ingredients, while the service is 
friendly and attentive.

younger … I really understood the 
feeling that this is not permanent, 
there’s nothing … I’m just here for a 
moment, and now it’s gonna move 
on … keeping up the barrier — I 
understood that very well,” Englert 
said. 

Drawing on one of the author’s 
intended themes, Alden relates to 
the eager drive his character por-

trays.
“I think for me, it was the kind 

of restlessness and the desire for 
something more out of life and 
reading a lot, and kind of thinking 
of your life as this journey towards 
something bigger ... In other stories 
of this genre, the guy is always this 
aloof, kind of cold jerk to the girls, 
and they wanted to write a story that 
shows that nice guys are good too — 
You know, nice guys can be smart, 

and guys could read books and guys 
can be polite … I see my character as 
sort of an update of a classic south-
ern gentlemen.”

When asked if they see them-
selves holding an Oscar anytime 
soon, they aren’t as assured.

“Yeah, I don’t know, I can’t imag-
ine. We’ll see. I think we’re both 
in a little bit of denial, but I also 
think that’s a good problem to have 
because that means the film did well, 

and that’s the most important thing: 
that the movie does well and people 
respond to it and connect to it,” 
Ehrenreich said.

“We just want to win best kiss,” 
Englert said.

They probably won’t even 
win that with the shadow of the 
“Twilight” finale following them 
to MTV. But for now, “Beautiful 
Creatures” is their focus — and if 
this movie does well, we’ll probably 

be seeing much more of Englert 
and Ehrenreich in the near future. 
There’s a definite possibility of suc-
cess if the film can manage to crawl 
out from the pit of its vamp-coun-
terpart’s reputation. Who knows — 
maybe lovesick witches will fill the 
void in every tween’s heart that was 
once occupied by a glittery vampire 
with abs. But are more screaming 
pubescents necessary at all? Only 
time will tell.

such as when Oshoosi masterfully 
simulated sex for a good minute or 
two, leaving no gesture or position 
undemonstrated. The jokes and the 
liberal use of racially charged words 
rendered some spectators rigid but 
eventually there was little choice but 
to relax and laugh — the beautiful 
result of McCraney’s nuanced writing 
and the committed acting.

There are moments of overpow-
ering emotion which are especially 
heart-wrenching for someone who 
has never seen a serious play and is 
witnessing all these cries and accusa-
tory finger pointings in real time, 
right before their eyes. The hard real-
ity that his actions affect more than 
just himself is inescapable to Oshoosi. 
The truth of things as they are, and 
how they must be, hits not only the 
characters, but resounds and reverber-
ates into the audience like the sound 
wave that comes after the bang of a 
drum. 

t he name really says it all. With a moniker like Pissed Jeans, anyone familiar with rock music 
could guess that this Philadelphia 
band has a hardcore punk sound, 
and on their new album Honeys, 
their approach hasn’t departed at all 
from the angry chaos of their previ-
ous work.

Right from the start, Honeys is 
full of dirty, grimy guitar, screeching 
feedback, and a steady banging drum 
beat. Opener “Bathroom Laughter” 
is actually a lot of fun for the first 
minute, but after only changing the 
droning guitar note once in its nearly 
three minute run-time, the end of 
the track can’t come quickly enough. 
This is generally the case with most 
songs on Honeys — interesting and 
varied riffs are few and far between.

Some parts stick out though, 
like a nonsensical, grungy noise 
jam called “Something About Mrs. 
Johnson,” which gives a glimpse 

of an ominous sense of humor. 
Likewise, the rusty guitar solo on 
“Teenage Adult” and the fun, shift-
ing guitar riffs on “Cathouse” were 
highlights that were missing in most 
parts of the album.

The lyrics are often undecipher-
able, but the verses that are audible 
prove interesting if not creepy, like 
the opening lines in “Chain Worker”: 
“I am a jaywalker/caught in an infi-
nite loop/ like a skipping compact 
disc.” Nearly everything is screamed 
or shouted, and Matt Koslof, the 
lead vocalist, has a voice that fits the 
band’s harsh, punk sound.

On Honeys, there’s an odd mix of 
music that is genuinely angry, rough, 
black, and driving, while at the same 
time being monotonous and a little 
boring. For those into hardcore punk 
rock, it might be worth a listen.

‘Brothers Size’ 
Gleams With 
Humor, Emotion 
and Beauty  

Foals came to prominence as a band due to their ability to walk the fine line between mass 
appeal and catering to underground 
crowds. They achieved this bal-
ance perfectly on their 2010 release 
“Total Life Forever,” a dance rock 
album capable of both introspection 
and exuberance.

On their newest release, “Holy 
Fire,” Foals attempt to recreate the 
success of their previous album, 
but in their ambitious drive to do 
so, they end up lacking the focus 
necessary to craft memorable songs. 
Instead, Foals seem intent on chan-
neling their blend of eclectic rock 
into a sound intended for festival 
stages — a bold move, but without 
tact or nuance.

On “Holy Fire,” Foals commit 
to just enough melodicism on each 
song to hook the listener in, but 
they often fall into a reliable dance 
rock formula, with buzzing guitars 

and synthesizer lines dragging the 
listener along. The unnecessarily 
dense and sometimes flat produc-
tion is saved only by a frantic and 
pounding percussion section. 

The lyrical content echoes the 
lack of commitment on the band’s 
part. While Foals have always placed 
a greater importance on instru-
mentation than lyrics, too often on 
“Holy Fire” abstraction is attempted 
when a more personal narrative 
would be a better fit. Nowhere is 
this more apparent than in “Late 
Night,” when he sings: “I'm the last 
cowboy in this town/ Empty veins 
and my plastic, broken crown.”

In the end, there’s nothing 
offensively wrong with the new 
Foals album, but there also isn't 
anything right, and perhaps that's a 
worse fate.

Being a musician when 
Carlos Santana is your

Perhaps partly because of 
this, Salvador Santana has 
shied away from the guitar. 
Instead, he is a talented 
keyboardist. His music is 
influenced by his father’s, 
but he also incorporates

Mali and the southern United States are pretty far apart in 
every sense. In the music of Toubab Krewe, though, the two 
regions are sonically combined. The band plays a weird 
combination of African music with rock from the American 
South. Sound odd? Well, it still sounds better than staying 
home on Valentine’s Day.

Rapper Juicy J will 
probably never win a 
Grammy. But he already 
has an Oscar — as far as I 
know, he’s the only person 
to accept the award with 
a grille on — so it’s fine. 
On top of that, he had 
one of the biggest hits of 
2012 with the endearingly 
ungrammatical “Bandz A

don’t have school the next

lion dancing, a dragon and

arts and an Asian story 
theater, to name a few.

I’ve never really understood why Scandinavians are so into 
hard rock. It seems to be so contrary to their usual painfully

If on-campus job fairs have proved unsuccessful, or if 
you’re just someone who never stops networking, here’s an 
opportunity worth taking. This job fair will include dozens 
of employers, some of the best in the area, who are seeking 
employees for hundreds of positions. Beat the unemployed 
college student blues and maybe find the right job for you.

“The Brothers Size,” set in Louisiana, is a play about two brothers 
— one of whom is being pulled away by another man — and the 
difference between biological and spiritual ties. Playwright Tarell 

Alvin McCraney has a gift for language that is on full display here. 



Dear Editor,
“They deserve a vote,” stated 

President Obama in Tuesday’s State 
of the Union address, referring to 
the many parents who lost their 
children to gun violence at schools. 

The latest massacre at Sandy 
Hook reminds us that our children 
need protection from the tragic 
gun violence that continues to rise 
in our nation. 

Unfortunately, political par-
ties do not seem to be taking this 
issue too seriously as they fail to 
make efforts towards effective gun 
control. Perhaps it is because they 
are too detached from their fellow 
Americans whose children are suf-
fering the consequences of lenient 
gun legislation. 

Whatever the reason, this is 
proof that we need to increase 
regulations on gun sales to keep 
them out of the hands of criminals 
or violent people. 

As citizens who care about 
safety, we support the president 
for encouraging bi-partisan change 
that is needed to control the reck-
less use of guns. 

The problem of gun violence 
can no longer be swept under 
the rug to protect those claiming 
their second amendment right as 
an excuse not to take action to 
improve gun policy. 

The lives of our youth are of 
more value than the right to bear 
arms alone. The right to bear arms 
was not created to give people the 
freedom to use guns to harm oth-
ers, but with the intent to protect, 
which clearly shows the ineffective-
ness of current policy.

 Guns must be taken out of the 
hands of those who wreak havoc 
and pain on others through the 
misuse of guns. 

Please do your part as a caring 
citizen and take action by stand-
ing up for gun control reform and 
encourage your congressperson to 
vote for gun safety to protect inno-
cent lives.

What’s more is that, seeing as each 
UC administrator’s plan is slightly 
different, goading students into SHIP 
reduces their autonomy when it 
comes to selecting a plan that fits one’s 
own specific medical needs (such as, 
for example, if a SHIP holder wanted 
to visit a dentist every once and 
awhile). At last week’s A.S. meeting, 
UCSD Vice Chancellor Penny Rue 
even voiced the opinion that having 
current students take on the SHIP 
debt singlehandedly would be unfair. 

As for how these debts were 
accumulated, UCSD simply offered 
SHIP premiums for too low a price to 
begin with. In 2001, UCSD switched 
to SHIP from its own student health 
insurance plan — a move that 

Campus-wide Senator Matt Mayeda 
told the Guardian was a direct con-
sequence of pressures from UCOP 
to join. At the time, SHIP premiums 
seemed outstandingly cheap. This is 
precisely because they were cheap — 
far too cheap, in fact.

This isn’t the first time UCSD has 
paved a road to debt with good inten-
tions. The SHIP deficit is particularly 
aggravating given that we’re facing 
a very similar problem with UCSD 
transportation services. After accu-
mulating over $2.1 million in debt 
this year alone, UCSD transportation 
services are now attempting to offset 
the damages. Now, parking rates have 
increased, and instead of receiving a 
free bus zone sticker at the beginning 
of the year, students will have to pay 
$36 per month to ride the busses. 

This massive increase has left many 
students furious, and organizations 
like the anti-transportation fee group 
Project Sumo are being formed in 
protest. It is more than likely that 
the changes in SHIP could elicit a 
similar student reaction, and the last 
thing UCSD needs is more campus 
protests.

The bottom line is that students 
would have willingly paid more at the 
onset (both for SHIP and bus trans-
portation), but the endless bait-and-
switch of pricing is both frustrating 
and unfair. UCSD needs to learn that, 
despite the good intentions, offering 
students cheap alternatives that are 
convenient yet ill-planned and fiscal-
ly irresponsible will inevitably result 
in serious financial problems and a 
subsequent blow to campus morale.

GAME 1
UCSD 8, Loyola Marymount 7

The Tritons took the first match 
against Loyola Marymount 8–7 last 
Saturday, Feb. 9. The match remained 
competitive, as neither team had more 
than a two-goal lead for the dura-
tion of the match. Sophomore Rachel 
Brooks — last season’s WWPA fresh-
man of the year — scored the first 
goal at the end of the second quarter. 
In the second half, the competition 
stiffened as both squads recorded 
four goals each. The Triton defense 
worked hard to defend against the 
Lions, with Lizotte scoring the game-
winner with just three seconds of play 
left in the match.

GAME 2
Arizona State 10, UCSD 4

Against Arizona State, a close first 
quarter was followed by an ASU-
dominated second period as the Sun 
Devils came out with five unanswered 
goals. Though the two teams went 
goal for goal in the third and fourth 
quarters, the Tritons were unable to 
gap the deficit in the end.

Kirkland ended the first day of 
the tournament, with five goals, while 
Lizotte finished with three.

GAME 3
UCSB 12, UCSD 11

On Sunday against UCSB, the 
Tritons started with a steady 2–1 
lead with goals from sophomore 
Jolene Guiliana and freshman Lauren 
Finwall. But the game heated up in 
the fourth quarter when UCSB took 
the lead at 7–5, the largest lead of the 
game. Kirkland rallied and brought 
the Tritons to a tie with three goals in 
the fourth to bring the score to 9–9 
and the game into overtime. Both 
teams scored a goal each in overtime, 
but UCSB took the game 12–11 with 
just 50 seconds remaining in over-
time.

GAME 4
Cal State Northridge 9, UCSD 7

The Tritons started strong 
against Cal State Northridge, leading 
4–3 with goals from Lizotte, Finwall 
and Guiliana. After the half, Lizotte 
scored again, but Northridge took a 
7–5 lead after the third quarter. In 
the fourth, Guillana and Wieseler 
netted two more goals, but it was too 
little too late as the Matadors took 
two late goals to cement the 9–7 
win and seventh place in the tour-
nament. In day two of tournament 
play, Wieseler and Lizotte both 
had three goals apiece, Finwall and 
Guilana scored two each, and fresh-
man goalkeeper Courtney Miller 
had 25 saves — 38 over the course 
of the weekend. 

Though the weekend ended on 
a somber note, Kreutzkamp was 
excited about his team’s weekend 
performance.

“We would go 3–1 in the losers 
bracket, and now we are going 1–3 in 
the winners bracket, and we got way 

more out of this tournament than we 
did before,” Kreutzkamp said to the 
UCSD Athletics Department. “They 
are competitors, and that’s what we 
are looking for: people who want to 
play, compete, and who are gamers, 
and we have those — we just need to 
fix the mistakes. We’re young.”

With the team fairly fresh and 
many members new to the program, 
many more factors come into play 
when thinking about the rest of the 
season.

“We are all adjusting really well, 
the older girls and the new ones,” 
Lizotte said. “The younger girls are 
still learning the way we play at 
UCSD, so it’s just a matter of them 
adjusting to this type of program, 
and the older girls are doing a great 
job of integrating them.”

The Tritons now have two weeks 
to get ready for a road tournament 
next weekend, Feb. 23 and Feb. 24 at 
the UC Irvine Invitational.

Tuesday, Feb. 12
UCSD vs Point Loma Nazarene

The Tritons then had to pack 
up and prepare to play again on 
Tuesday at home against Point Loma 
Nazarene University. The marathon 
game started at 6:00 p.m. and lasted 
four hours and thirty-seven minutes. 
The team proved resilient and won 
a thriller in extra innings. The win 
brings the Tritons to 5-2 on the sea-
son and 3-1 at home. 

UCSD 6, Point Loma Nazarene 5
Throughout the game, Point 

Loma gained leads, but the Tritons 
kept fighting back to even the score. 
Point Loma scored first in the second, 
but UCSD caught up with a bases-
loaded walk to Seigel in the third. 
Point Loma again regained the lead in 
the fourth, but UCSD battled back in 
the bottom of the inning with a RBI 
by Danny Susdorf. 

The Tritons changed the tide and 
surged ahead in the seventh on the 
strength of Susdorf, who singled, 
stole second and third and scored on 
a wild pitch. Susdorf finished 3-for-5 
for the game, scoring two runs and 

adding a RBI. It was Point Loma’s 
turn to battle back, and scored twice 
in the eighth and once in the ninth. 

UCSD trailed going into the ninth 
but refused to go down and scored 
twice in the ninth to tie the game. 
Point Loma allowed the Tritons to 
come back, giving up runs on a wild 
pitch and a walk to Nick La Face. 

Junior Sean Rowan pitched two 
solid innings to shut out Point Loma, 
striking out three and allowing the 
Tritons to take the game in the elev-
enth. Susdorf walked to lead off the 
inning and later scored thanks to a 
throwing error by the Point Loma 
pitcher Stewart Kellen on a sacrifice 
bunt by Rahn. 

After an encouraging four games, 
the Tritons open up a four game series 
Feb. 15 through Feb. 17 against Cal 
State Stanislaus, including a double-
header on Saturday. The upcoming 
series is their first against a California 
Collegiate Athletic Association con-
ference opponent. The games are 
home at Triton Ballpark, with the first 
pitch this Friday, Feb. 15 at 6 p.m.

STARTING STRONG
The Tritons went 2-1 against Grand Canyon University and took an extra-inning 

win against Point Loma last weekend heading into CCAA play.

BASEBALL

The No. 21 nationally ranked UCSD Tritons continued the hot start to their 2013 season, taking their last three 
of four games played. The Tritons played a 
three game set in Phoenix, Arizona against 
the non-conference Grand Canyon University 
Antelopes. UCSD clinched the series by win-
ning the first two games, and narrowly missed 

a series sweep, falling just short in the final 
game. 

“We’ve won two series against two quality 
teams, with this one in a tough place to play,” 
UCSD Head Coach Eric Newman said to the 
UCSD Athletics Department. “We took the 
first two games here, and were in a position to 
win the third. That shows me a lot.” 

WATER  POLO

UCSD women’s water polo took eighth 
place among 16 teams competing in the Triton 
Invitational last weekend, Feb. 9 and 10. The 
No. 19 nationally ranked Tritons played four 
matches over the course of the weekend, with 
one exciting 8–7 win over Loyola Marymount 
University, before losing to Arizona State 
University, UC Santa Barbara and Cal State 
Northridge (10–4, 12–11, 9–7).

“There was a ton to like today; this is a 
tournament where we are usually playing in 
the loser’s bracket and playing teams that 
don’t really challenge us,” UCSD Head coach 
Brad Kreutzkamp said to the UCSD Athletics 
Department. “It was our goal to play teams 
that challenge us and we did — we didn’t back 
down one time. We made mistakes but those 
mistakes can be fixed. I think the team is in a 

good spot right now.”
Players like freshman Julia Kirkland and 

junior Sarah Lizotte both had great perfor-
mances, with Kirkland scoring 11 goals and 
Lizotte with seven.

“I think the tournament went fantastic,” 
Lizotte said. “It was good weekend despite 
the 1–3 score, which doesn’t sound good, but 
it’s really good for us for the beginning of the 
season.”

Two weeks prior at the UCSB Winter 
Invitational, the Tritons went 3–1, losing just 
one match to Cal State Northridge 19–17.

“We had two weeks off to really study what 
we were doing and we made some adjust-
ments on our defense and it’s really improved,” 
Kreutzkamp said. “Now we have to fix the 
offensive side.”

The opening game of the series featured UCSD’s ace and NCBWA West Region pitcher of the 
week, senior Ryan Goodbrand. Goodbrand was dominant, pitching six scoreless innings and 
striking out five. He carried a no-hit bid into the sixth.   

While Goodbrand kept the Antelopes off the board, the Tritons were adding runs, scoring 
once in the second, third, fourth and fifth for run support. Freshman Corbin Wirta recorded 
his first career extra-base hit, doubling in the third to bring a runner home. 

Goodbrand left after six with the Tritons up 4-0, and they continued to add to their lead 
behind a two RBI triple in the eighth by first baseman Richard Seigel, who finished 2-for-4 with 
three runs, two RBI and a walk. 

The Tritons needed all the runs they could muster, however, as Grand Canyon came storm-
ing back with a five-run eighth inning, featuring a three-run homerun by the catcher Paul 
Swingle. UCSD pushed two more insurance runs across the plate in the top of the ninth to 
cushion their lead and held on for a 10-5 victory.

In the second game of the series the Tritons had to battle back from an early deficit. The 
Antelopes got on the board early with a RBI triple by Derek Mendoza off UCSD starting pitcher, 
sophomore Dan Kolodin. UCSD had a triple of their own, as junior Scott Liske tripled in the third, 
and was hit in by center fielder Danny Susdorf, who finished 3-for-5 with two RBI. 

Nevertheless, the Tritons trailed 4-2 entering the eighth. In the eighth the Tritons exploded for 
six runs, starting with a two RBI homerun by senior Seigel. Susdorf added a RBI single and junior 
Justin Rahn drove in three runs with a double to left field, as the Tritons jumped out in front 8-4. 

Grand Canyon mounted a comeback in the ninth with a pair of RBI singles by Michael Pomeroy 
and Mendoza but ultimately fell short. The Tritons held on to take the second game and clinch the 
series. 

In the third game of the series, the Tritons jumped out ahead with a two-run first inning. Rahn 
singled in the first run of the game after a double by shortstop Dillon Moyer, and third baseman 
Sam Michaels walked to bring Moyer across. UCSD scored twice again in the fourth inning 
behind a two RBI single by Rahn and took a 4-0 lead into the bottom of the fourth.

In the bottom half of the inning, Triton pitcher Trevor Scott, who had no difficulty in the first 
three innings, ran into trouble by giving up an RBI double and five straight singles. Junior transfer 
David Hart came on to relieve Scott but gave up two more RBI. In total the Antelopes scored six 
runs on seven hits and one error and took the lead. 

Grand Canyon later scored once more in the sixth on a sacrifice fly by Panaccione. The Tritons 
attempted to come back, scoring twice in the eighth. Seigel singled in a run, and an error by the 
third baseman allowed another to cross, but the Tritons failed to push across another and dropped 
the final game of the series.
