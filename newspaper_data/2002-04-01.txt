Cunningham hosts forum 
regarding lone-rate' plan 
Director of Housing and Dining Services 
answers student questions and concerns 
By TOM NEELEY 
Contributing Writer 

UCSD Housing and Dining 
Services Director Mark 
Cunningham spoke March 14 at 
Earl Warren College in a ques-
tion-and-answer session with sru-
dents regarding the new "one-
contract, one-rate" plan. 

About a dozen srudents attend-
ed, and each brought a variety of 
concerns. 

"I wanted people to come and 
just talk to Mark Cunningham 
directly," said Tony Quezada, a 
Warren resident adviser who 
helped organize the session. 

Under the plan, residence hall 
fees will be lowered and apartment 
fees will be raised nen year so that 
a double room will cost $7,108 
and a si ngle room will cost $7,308. 
All students living on campus 
would also be required to have a 
meal plan. The new housing fees 
include the minimum $1,800 meal 
plan. 

The new rates will make hous-
ing fees at UCSD the lowest in the 
UC system, Cunningham said.

UCSD finds new energy provider 
after Enron Corp. goes bankrupt 

Final voter stats show 
apathy reigns at UCSD 

The new seven-month contract with Arizona Public 
Service Company begins spring quarter; prices not set 
By LAURA McGANN 
Staff Writer 

A new quarter starts this week 
and so does UCSDs new energy 
contract. The University of 

alifornia's former energy con-
tract with bankrupt energy giant 
Enron Corp. expired March 31 . 
The University of California 
, igncd a new seven-month con-
tract with Arizona Public Service 
Company that went into effect the 
same day. 

The new contract with APS, an 
$8 billion subsidiary of Pinnacle 

West Capital Corp., will supply 
seven UC campuses and 19 
California State University cam-
puses with electricity. 

Prices are still being discussed 
fo r the initial seven-month con-
tract. 

"We are still talking about the 
rate. The way [the contract] was 
written, the kilowatts per dollar 
is still up in the air," said UC 
spokesperson Charles 
McFadden. 

If the con tract is renewed, the 
price the university will be 
charged for its electrical power

Low voter rurnout character-
ized California's Mareh 5 primary 
election - and the voting habits of 
registered UCSD residents. 

Finalized nlrnout figures from 
the San Diego County Registrar of 
Voters shows 8 percent rurnout at 
the two UC D precincts. Some 
1 10 ballots were cast out of 1,409 
registered voters at the polling sta-
tions set up in the Price Center and 
atJohn Muir College, and through 
absentee ballots. 

"It's unfortunately low," said 
A.S. Council President Jeff Dodge. 
"J'm not surprised. Being a ca mpus 
resident who voted, I ,aw the 
polls." 

The low nlrnout is indicative of 
srudents nOt caring about politics at 
the local, sta te and national level 
and of politicians not addressing 
issues relative to smdents, Dodge 
sa id. 

"It goe both ways, but we have

2 NEW 

Housing: 
Students question making 
meal plans mandatory 
Continued from page 1 
million in new hOllsing to accommo-
date the university's projected enroll -
ment growth. 

T he opening of new residence halls 
and apartments at the new Eleanor 
Roosevelt College campus th is fall 
begins (hat process. 

Cunningham said that current and 
(mure students who live on campus 
would be payi ng for the projects 
through their housing fees. There is 
no other source of income to build 
new housing or pay for staffing, he 
said. 

"The problem is that we are self-
supporti ng. You are our customer. You 
are it. There is no state money. T here 
is no federal money." Cunningham 
said. "V\fhat it comes down to is that 
the customer basically drive the sys-
tCln ." 

The goal is to be able to house half 
of undergrad uates and ha lf of graduate 
students. 

Currently, 32 percent of under-
graduates and 36 percent of graduate 
smdenrs are housed on campus. T hese 
numbers :lrc ranked second and fi rst, 
respectively, within the UC system. 

With increasing enroll ment, 
Cunningham noted that more money 
is b~lI1g spent on hiring new staff to 
accommodate more students. 

"The total income for the depart-
ment hasn't changed," Cunningham 
said. "We're still at $43 million. We 
aren't generati ng millions of dollars, 
but we're spcnding a lot of money on 
staffin* that we would have just had 
profit. 

Students in ancndance seemed to 
understand the need to change the 
rates. They were more concerned with 
tile m3nd;tory $1,800 meal plan for 
various reasons. 

Many students questi oned the 
necessity of having a meal plan whi lc 
living in the apartments. 

oille students thought that 
increasing the apa rtment fees in place 
of the mea l plan was a better idea . 
Cunningham was against tile idea on 
principles of fairness. 

"We did look at that, but that real-
ly doesn't fl y for me. It's just taxi ng 
people," he said. 

Cunningham sa id that the new 
plan takes everything into account. 

"Let's just take the entire program, 
which is what we did essentially, and 
mix it all together and say, 'you're not 
going to get anything for livi ng in the 
apartments otllcr than the opporru ni -
ty to subsidize residence halls,'" 
Cunningham said. "That's not fa ir. It's 
just not fai r. [ know what you're say-
ing. It's more expensive, but it's not 
fa ir. And the issue of fairness and equi -
ty is really important to our communi-
ty." 

Some srudents, such as Quezada, 
still felt that being able to live without 
a meal plan in tile apartments encour-
ages smdents to become independent. 

"[ don't think it's fair for the people 
in the apartments because in the 
apartments you have your own kitchen 
and your own stove, so you're more 
independent," Quezada said. "But 
when you get a meal plan, it takes 
away from your growing experience." 

Another student asked whether 
residents could opt out of the meal 
plan due to special dietary needs. 

Cunningham said that there is an 
appeal process that srudents must go 
through to be exempt. 

"There are people righ. now that 
are in dining programs that Opt out 
because we can't meet their needs. 
They are very rare," he said . 

Lisa Cho, a Warren freshman, felt 
her grocery choices would be limited 
by using her meal plan to buy gro-
cenes. 

"You can get so much more, like a 
better variety of sruff, from Ralphs 
than you can from Earl 's Place or from 
Canyon Vista," she said. "And a lot of 
my roommates like to shop at the 
Asian markets at Convoy Street, and 
you can't get that anywhere on cam-
pus."

ABOUT THE FUTURE? 

BRIEFLY 
Berkeley study links churchgoing to long life 

Regular churchgoers will have to wait significantly 
longer to meet their maker. according to a report con-
ducted by the University of Califomia at Betic.eley. 
According to the newty released study, attending reliÂ· 

~ious services once a week or more will decrease one's 
nsks of death and health problems, even after modify-
ing for health problems, age and other risk factors. 

Researchers from Berkeley's School of Public 
Health and the Public Health Institu te concluded that 
churchgoers have 21 percent less chance of dying 
from a circulatory disease, while there was no signif-
icant difference in the death risks caused by cancer. 

The study also shows that those attendi ng ser-
vices less than weekly have a 66 percent greater risk 
of dying from a respiratory disease and a 99 percent 
greater chance of death caused by a digestive dis-
ease than weekly attendees. 

Data from the study was taken from 3 I years of 
longitudinal examination of over 6,500 adults from 
Alameda County, Calif., an ethnically, economically and 
religiously diverse community allowing researchers to 
make their findings relevant because of its comparabil-
ity to the population of the United States. 

Funding for the study was made possible by grants 
coming from the Califomia Department of Health 
Services, the National Institute of Aging. and the 
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. The report 
'hill be published in the April 4 edition of the 
International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine. 

Professor makes psychiatry 
look easy, receives award 

UCSD School of Medicine's Stephen M. Stall, a 
professor of psychiatry, will be awarded the 2002 
Prize for Education in Psychology and Neurology by 
the Lundbeck International Neuroscience Foundation. 
Stall 'hill receive his award June 23, 2002, in Montreal, 
Canada, at the 23rd Congress of the International 
College of Neuropsychopharmacology. 

According to LlNF, Stahl has developed teaching 
materials that Â·present the essential concept of psy-
chophannacology and psychiatry in a simple visual 

form~ 
Stahl, who believes that most adults are visual 

leamers, developed teachin& methods for his med-
ical students so they could Visualize concepts of the 
basic groundwotic. first and then apply the data and 
facts they learned in lectures and readings. The pro-
fessor integrates teaching icons, animation and com-
puter slideshow presentations into his teaching to 
help lay the visual groundwork down. 

In 1996, Stahl sought to extend his success in 
teaching b.Y. visuals, repetition and interaction by 
authoring Essential Psychopharmacology: a text-
book and CD-ROM that emphasize learning in an 
interactive matter. 

UCSD develops new 
smallpox treatment 

Researchers at UCSD school of medicine and the 
Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System have 
developed an oral drug that blocks deadly agents 
causing smallpox and other orthopox diseases. 

Hexadecyloxypropyl-cidofovir, or HOP-COV, is an 
antivira l medication that halts the growth and spread 
of variola, the virus responsible for causing smallpox 
and orthopox strands. 

HOP-CDV was developed as part of a national 
effort of drug developers to design an antiviral sub-
stance for people infected with smallpox. Currently, 
HDP-CDV is not available for human use. The drug 
must continue safety trials in animals, and ultimate-
ly in healthy humans. Testing is being conducted by 
the u.s. Army Medical Research Institute for 
Infectious Diseases.

Drawing the line between art and artsy 
UCSD's artistic students overlooked for 'real artists' 

A dmit Day is com-ing April 13 - that 
long-awaited fiesta 
where the happiest (or 
most motivated) 0.5 
percent of UCSD's stu-
dents try to convince 
the newly admitted 
freshman candidates 
that UCSD is just like 
any other large public 
school. 

For a day, UCSD smdents have 
pride in their sporrs teams, an 
active and exciting on-campus 
social life, wonderFully accessible 
professors and sections for large 
classes where magnificent tcaching 
assistants carefully teach you any-
thing you miss in lecture. Even the 
parking will be perfect (Admit Day 
is on 3 Sarurday, after all). 

As momentous as the coming 
occasion is, another yearly tradi-
tion associated with admissions is 
closer to hand: the release of the 
statistics on the newly admitted 
pool. Last year, the UCSD press 
release came Tuesday, April 3. I 
imagine the admissions offi ce wise-
ly refuses to release anything on 
the Monday after April Fools' D ay. 

While the timing of the release 
of the information is dependent on 
the UC Office o f the President, the 
statistics will probably be relevant 
fo r two reasons. First, conserva-
tives will use them to say that the 
numbers of minorities admitted to 
UCSD are rising, and thus our

I am artisti c. I am by no means 
an artist. 

When people ask me what my 
ma jor is, I reluctantly answer 
" media." r often hear the words 
ro ll out of my mouth and notice 
th at this simple response sounds so 
much better than "visual arts-
media with an emphasis in fi lm 
and video ." 

Do I plan on being a filmmak-
er' Doubtful. r plan on being a 
corporate sellout. Translation: I 
wi 11 pursue a career in gra phic 
design, editing, advertising or 
some other integral pa rt 01' the 
commercially drivv\ society tha t 
artists despist!. 

I dread answering the "What's 
your major'" question, and I hate 
being looked down upon for pur-
suing an artistic career instead of 
an intellecu13l one. But what r 
loathe most - even more than the 
overwhelming disappointment I 
sense from ' those who expect me to 
follow more of an overachievlllg 
academic path - is the assump-
tion that being an art major is a 
joke. 

The most common reaction I 
get fro m those who dare to delve 
further into the discussion of Illy 
major after hearing my short, sim-
ple, p lease-don't-ask-me-to-
explain-this response is, "Oh, that 
mus t be fun ." When I hea r th is, I 
know they're impl}~ng that fun 
equals easy. 

For the record: Being a fi lm 
and video major is not easy, espe-
cially when you 're competing with 
a bunch of artists. 

T he easiest way I know of to

differentiate between an artist and 
one who is artistic can be beSt 
described by an exampl e from my 
linguistics 7 lecture: Someone who 
is deaf is without hearing, and 
someone who is Deaf uses 
American Sign Language and is a 
member of th~ culmrally rich Deaf 
communi ty. Similarly, one who is 
artistically inclined possesses the 
abili ty to make 3rt, while artists 
live and breathe their work - they 
devore thei r lives to art, and they 
lovt what they do. 

I have always liked to dance, 
write, draw, sculpt, paint - you 
name it. [ have always been artisti-
ca lly inclined, but I don 't thi nk I'll 
ever become an artist. I don 't have 
that kind of passion for my art. 
Perhaps I don't even have the nat-
ural talent. More importantly, I 
.;ould never actually convince 
mysel f that devoti ng any time to 
really developing my skills would 
be practical or beneficial to my 
quest to capture that ever-elusive 
creamre called Success. 

I've been dancing since) was 7 
years old, but am 1 good? No. 
Could I ever be in a professional 
company? Not 3 chance. I'm only 
5-foot-3, I'm not near ly thi n 
enough to be a professional dancer 
and I don't have the poten tial. As 
much as people envy me for having 
a major that's "so fun" and what 
they assume to be "someth.ing I 
love," I envy artists for havi ng what-
ever it is that makes them great. 

A friend and I have two words

world is. T his led us to the conciu-
sion lhat to be a great artist, one 
must be tortured. T his also led us 
to the conclusion that we are way 
too normal to be art students. 

I recentl y discussed this with 
ano ther friend of mi ne, a non-
visual arts major, and she agreed 
that there is a strong prej udice 
against non artists in art classes. I 
ho nestly think tha t the reason my 
teaching a sistants don 't take me 
ser iously is that I'm a reasonably 
good-looking young woman who 
gives the impression that there's 
more to her life than sitting in 
front of a computer screen making 
undergrou nd computer art while 
listening to experimental ound art 
on her down time away from 
researching obscure indie films . 

Excu c me for having a well-
rounded life and gi \1ng in to a bit 
of pop culture. I've already admi t-
ted I'm not an arti r. There's no 
use pretending to be somethi ng 
I'm not. I JUSt don't understand 
why the people who already obvi-
ously m'e a rti~ts deserve more 
praise and attention than those of 
us who arc merdy trying to 
acquire some skills (or at leas t pass 
some general education clas es). 

I don't think that what artists 
possess that makes them great ca n 
be learned: You either have it or 
you don't. 

I don't have a problem with .,,01 
bei ng an artist. There are plenty of 
jobs out there for those of us more 
artistically incl ined. However, 
there is no foru m for the nlore 
corpo rate-geared art sUldent at 
UCSD. 

C.II me crazy, bur I thought the 
reason we are paying tens of thou-
sands of dollars to attend college is 

so that we wi ll be ahle to go out 
and get fabu lous jobs to suppurt 
ou rselves. Instead, I get iol d that 
my art isn't conceptual enou!:(h and 
that I'm a sellout and have 1\ 0 
artistic integrity for wannng to 
pursue a career in commercial art. 

I sti ll strive to be the over-
achiever I've always been , and thIS 
is part of the reason 1 reluctantly 
answer the "What's your maJor' " 
question with "media." It sou nd~ a 
Ii ttle more prestigious than "art." 
It 's dumb, I know, but 1 still think 
tha t all those people who Im!:!w lIle 
way hack when ,ll1d expected me to 
go off and do sOl11eth i ng pro-
foundly overachievi ng witll my Itfc 
would be disappointed that I went 
to college to be a visual arts maJor. 

For those of you true 3rDStS out 
tllere, [ apolq,'ize if this rant h:I' 
offended you . I'm obvlOu,ly Ju,t 
jealou. I'm after a little more 
fa me, !(lrnllle and glory than the 
poor, stan~ng arost lifestyle can 
provide . If that makes me a sellout, 
so be it. 1 "ill continue to admire 
the work of all the true arri~h Oil 
this campus and wonder what It IS 
they're doing here when they 
already po sess the ski lls that tlle 
rest of us work so hard to imlute . 

A few inspiring words of WIS-
dom to my fellow artistic people: 
Go ahead and It!arn all the theory 
you want. It won't do you an)' 
good. Being an artist i not some-
thing we can learn . If you're JIISt 
artistically inclined like I am, don't 
beat yourself up roo much for it. 
Instead, gather all the technical 
slci lls you can, and go work in a 
career you wi ll be able to support 
yourself with. At least find some-
thi ng that makes YOll happy - r 
know I will.

War'll. Her defiance and affability, 
it was noted, not only brought her 
closer to the hearts of her people, 
but also gave them the courage to 
stand against invasion. 

It is perhaps fitting that on

have come about due to actual 
interest or whether they are an 
inevitable conclusion after last 
year's mockery of the principles of 
divided government when the 
entire Uniry slate won. 

One has to wonder whether the 
average UCS D student actua ll y 

took the time to read the voter 
information pamphJets and under-
stand the candidates, or whether 
they simply voted for the slate with 
the most signs on display. The evi-
dence suggests the latter, and no 
doubt, candidates in this election 
have wised up and rea lized that to 
win, they must gather up as many 
of their buddies to run for as many 
posts as possible. 

This is ridiculous; it implies that 
recognition is the only factor in a 
student election, and consequently, 
there are no real issues at stake. 
That souMs a lot like high school, 
does it not? 

I horribly wish that there were

my understanding, though, that the

Six University of Minnesota students 
streak naked during annual event 
Lack of complaints kept police away from the event that 
honored English prankster Jack Mytton in Minneapolis 

MIN 'EAPOLIS (U-Wirc) -
For some sntdents, the first day of 
school after spring break means the 
end of public nudi ry. 

But six University of Mirll1esora 
students prolonged the debauchery 
for one more day by running naked 
through Northrop Mall at about 
12 :15 p.m. on March 25. 

The male stud ents ran through 
campus wearing only wigs, hats, 
shoes and sunglasses. The event, 
Ienown as the Jack Mytton Run, is 
in its fourth year. 

Junior Erica Barlow said she's 
een the event every year si nce she's 

been in school. She aid it always 
takes place the first day after spri ng 
break, but usually only one or two 
people run . 

After the students were dropped 
off on Washingron Avenue, they 
ran through the mall area and into 
a cul-de-sac next to Northrop 
Auditorium, where they were

C unningham described a tenta-
tive plan to purchase grocery items 
for students. Students would have a 
"menu" to choose various items 
from llsing thei r meal plan. The 
items would in turn be purchased 
in bulk. This service would be tar-
geted towa rd those living in the 
apartments. 

Acknowledging that prices for 
food will inevitably be more than at 
large supermarket chains, 
Cunningham said he wants to be 
able to satisfy the needs of those 
living in the apartments. 

"We can't be Vons, but maybe 
have better pricing than certainly 
Earl's Place, which I hear tends to 
be expensive," Cunningham said. 

Regents Scholars in attendance 
raised othe r concerns. Currently, 
Regents Schol ars are guaranteed 
four years of on-campus housing. 
Darlene Hunt is a Regents Scholar 
and a Warren college junior who 
lives on campus. She and other 
Regents Scholars living on campus 
feel that they deserve an exemp-
tion from the required meal plan. 

Cunningham told her that it 

picked up. Beside the regular snt-
dents walking near the mall , about 
30 people gathered to watch in 
front the auditorium.

would be hard to explain to some 
students why they had to pay for 
the meal plan while others were 
exempted from it. 

"[ teems so elitist and maybe 
that's the way it's supposed to be," 
Cunningham aid. "It seems 
inequitable, it seems unfair, and it's 
hard to explain to everyone else 
why you get it and they don't." 

Another suggestion was to have 
apartment residents use a $1,800 
Triton Plus accou nt in lieu of meal 
points. 

The idea was considered, but 
money put into Triton Plus would 
not necessarily come back to 
H&DS. 

"If you take a dollar to wherever 
you want to take it - the bookstore 
or wherever - that doesn 't come 
back to housing. So it doesn't help 
offset any of our costs," 
Cunningham said. 

Cunningham stressed through-
out the session the intentions of 
H& OS to best serve the needs of 
the students. 

"Our position was, rather than 
come back and tax people, to pro-
vide a service to give you some-
thing," Cunningham said. 

He emphasized that H&DS 
seeks only to break even.

at the Universiry of Michigan. 

Moments before the naked stu -
dents ran through the mall , police 
sirens wailed. Someone in the small 
crowd said, " Here they come," and 
was answered with nervous laughter. 

Renee Powell, a math major 
who happened to be in the mall 
when the naked men passed her, 
said she was surprised. 

"I thought it was funny but [ 
don't know why they would run 
across campus naked," she said. " [ 
don't know if they're in a frat or 
something; I can only guess." 

No police arrived on the scene. 
Police dispatcher Karen Guinn said 
they did not get any calls regarding 
the occurrence. 

"If we don't get any calls we 
can't do anything," she said.

Cho left the session feeling that 
Cunningham was redundant and 
was not seriously considering the 
suggestions of the students. 

"He was very lengthy in all his 
answers," Cho said. "It seemed a 
lot of his answers to the questions 
were repetitions of things he 
already said. H e also doesn't seem 
very open to new suggesti ons 
about alternatives to the plan that 
[students in attendancel had." 

Hunt felt more comfort with 
the plan, although she still held 
some reservations. 

"It seems like it 's economica lly 
feasible, and it's really one of the 
onl y ways to do it," she said. 
"H owever, as a Regents Scholar, I 
think that since we are al ready liv-
ing on borrowed time and most 
people can't be here for four years 
anyway, that Regents Scholars 
should have an exception to this 
required meal plan." 

Quezada believed there would 
still be problems with the plan. 

"I think it's going to cause more 
chaos for the restaurant workers," 
he said. "They're going to end up 
having more students come in than 
they can barely handle now." 

Cunningham still encouraged 
comments &om students, and invited 
e-mails to mcrml1inghamÂ®ucsd.edu.

Officials at the University of

- within two weeks of taking the 
.,tudy. That IS the same percentage 
the ~tudy fount! in 1993. 

\ \'cch ler "ha~ been a SOrt of a 
bulldog in forcing people to see the 
worst of what is our there," said UV 
Presidcnt John T. Casteen III. 

.\ lore students are abstaining 
li'om drinking and m(Jre students arc 
cxposcd to information about alco-
hol Jbuse, the sntdy found . More 
college studenrs also arc living in 
dru!{-and-akohol -frec dormJtories. 

Nonethdess, the sallle numbers 
of tudents are binge drinking, call-
ing into que,tion the effectivcncss 
of college progr.lllls ro combat 
alcohol abuse. 

The lJ nil'cr iry of Vir6>inia, how-
ever, ha, done a bener job of address-
ing drinking prohlems than many 
other UIlJ\'cr~ities, Casteen ~aid . 

"Our remedies have probably 
been more rigorous and more 
effective than some remedies else-
where have been ," he said . 

The University of Virginia'S 
Center for Alcohol and Substance 
Education and the Student Health 
Center don't consider the binge 
drinking statistic to be a useful way 
of measuring srudent drinking prob-
lems, student heal th officials said. 

The binge drinking statistic is 
misleading because the definition of 
dangerous drinking can differ among 
people and siruations, said Jennifer 
Bauerle, social norllls marketing 
coordinator for Sntdent Health. 

Binge drinking statistics can 
lead people ro think that drinking 
problems are more seriolls than 
they really are, Bauerle said. 

"We believe many university 
srudents are making responsible 
choices," she added. 

Moreover, Student Health's 
concern is not JUSt how much Stu-
dents are drinking but also whether 
students' drinking negatively 
affects their lives . 

According to the Health 
Promotion Survey, an online sur-
vey conducted by' Student Heallh's 
Office of Il ealth PromoLion, the 
number of drinks srudellts say they 
consume per week has deClined 
since the study started in 1999. In 
2002 , the 3vernge university ~ruÂ­
dent reportedly consumed 3.6 alco-
holic bevcrnges a week. 

The number of drinks first-years 
report drinking has dropped from a 
high of 6.9 in 2000 to 3A in 2002 . 

The decline III drinking 11:Is 
been even more dramatic within 
the Greek system.

Fraternity members reported 
drinking 6.4 drinks per week in 
2002, down from 18.8 in 2001. 
Sorority members reported con-
suming 4.4 drinks per week, down 
from 7.6 last year. 

Fraternities also have taken 
steps to reduce serving alcohol to 
underage srudents and to students 
who are already intoxicated, said 
Aaron Laushway, assistant dean of 
fraternity and sorority life. 

"Fewer students are consuming 
alcohol dangerously and fewer sru-
dents are being served at fraterni-
ties," Laushway said. "That's my 
hope. I'm trusting our students 
who tell me they have made great 
progress." 

umbers of students reporting 
they have gone to the emergency 
room, gotten into a fight, per-
formed poorly on a test or been 
injured as a result of drinking have 
either remained the same or 
decreased slightly since last year, 
Bauerle said. 

The University of Virginia has 
intensified its cfforts to prevent 
alcohol abuse since 1997, Assistant 
Director of C.A.S .E . Marianne 
Bonday said . In that yea r, seven 
college students in Vi rglll13 died 
from alcohol-related causes.

grams, such as C.A.S .E.'s peer ed u-
cator program Alcohol and Drug 
Abu e Prevention Team and the 
health center 's publication Tbe fall 
Sent J01l17l01, as well as the universi-
ty police efforts to enforce drinking 
laws, for the decl ine in drinking.

walk 

Balboa Park combines 
culture, history and the 

wonders of spring 

O n a dear .pring day. Balboa Park seems to stretch fon:ver. 
It doesn' go on fbrever. of COIJl'fe. The 

park com~ about 1,200 acres in the.. 
heart of San Diego, just north of d0wn-
town. In fact, it's about the same _ u 
UCSD's main campus. 

'Vhat giftS the park that never-ending 
feel is the sheu breadth and diversity of 
what lies within it and the history behind 
it. 

THB UCSD GUARDIAN 

The park was created and named City 
Park in 1868. and ill Jandscaping was 
begun by renowned hort:ic:ulturist Kate O. 
Sasiona at the end of the 19th century. 
The park was renamed in hoaDr of explor-
er VucoNUfiez de Balboa at the beginning 
of the 20th century and was subsequently 
6lled with Spanish an:hitecture. 

The area &tst eatoed national notice 
when it hosted 1915's Panama-California 
Exposition, which celebrated the com-

pletioD of the Panama Canal lind dis-
played the latest teclmolorical advances 
of the Orne, including II car that could 
bum rubber lit a 5CTeeching 65 mph. 

Balboa Park is now known for -
among other things - the self-pro-
claimed "world famous" San Diego Zoo, 
and its 800 species of animals and 6,500 
species of plants.

No. 

No, I do not, because you get sick of the

Yeah, because it's part of our school and we

I don't know. No comment on the Middle

Weezer, because I saw them when they came 
last year ... and they were really good, and 
they'd be even better for free. 

I would like some sort of social dancing, 
instead of the ballet sort of dance. 

It would really suck for them if they didn't, but 
it would free up parking for me, so I'm kind of 
mixed on the issue. 

No, because [Sierra) Summit food is nasty, and 
there's no point to having a meal plan if you're 
in an apartment. 

I might if! have time. It's not high on my pri-
ority list. 

I worked, and I slept a lot. 

Not really. I glued a quarter to my mom's floor

Something like bioinformatics. 

Not really, because it's so overcrowded as it is. 

If students want to get their own food they 
should be able to. 

Yeah, because I think it's important. If students

COntinued from .,... 11 

There are also 14 museums in 
the park, and there aren 't just oil 
paintings on display here. Besides 
the San Diego Museum of Art, 
there is the Museum of 
Photographic Arts; the Reuben H. 
Fleet Science Theatre, which 
opened the country's first OMNI-
MAX theater in 1978 and has since 
replaced OMNIMAX with the 
newer IMA .. X technology; the Sa n 
Diego Hall of Champions, which 
highlights achievements of locally 
and nationally known athl etes 
from America's fi nesr city; rhe San 
Diego Model Railroad Mpscum; 
the Veteran's Memorial Center 
Museum; and the Timken 
Museum of Art, which is alwavs 
free. . 

Balboa Park's fa unal offerings 
range from the arid , with a dcseCrt 
garden and a cactus plot, to the 
tropical in Palm Canyon, and the 
Mediterranean Alcazar Garden. 
And rhe gardens say nothing of the 
sheer bcauty of the manicured 
lawns anci" sloping canyons 
throughour the park, as well as the 
park's 15,000 rree . 

Culolral attranions include the 
Old Globe Theatre complex. which 
boasts multiple stagt:s that . how 
dozens of plays each yea r; the 
Centro Cui rural de la Raza, which 
showcases Chicano, Mexican and 
Native American art and hi,rorv: the 
V,roridBear Center, which sp<;n:,or

careries around the city. The lb 
Pavili on in the park ;s Japanese 
Fricndship Garden serves sushi, tea 
and soups. And, of course. there are 
cafes serving coffee and snacks, as 
weI! as street vendors selling hot 
dogs and ice cream. 

The entertainers scattered 
along EI Prado, the "main drag" 
of Balboa Park's muscum district, 
are an unofficial but long-estab-
li shed att raction at the park . 
Srreer Illusicians, clowns, mimes, 
tarot readers and more line the 
Prado leading to the huge Park 
Street fountain . While some 
demand a "donation" for their 
services, th ey all contribute to the 
carnival-like atmosphere just by 
being there. 

Navigating all this can be trick]'. 
T hough parking lots arc spread 
around the park, they are oftcn full 
on bright, waml days, when tourists 
anJ San Diegans alike neck to the

from 8:30 :l.In. to 6 p.m. every eighr

Tennis

Hawaiian 

â¢ SOjourn 
Men beat 
Chaminade, 
lose to BYU 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

March 25 and March 27 saw the 
men's tennis team face opponents 
from opposite ends of the spectrulll 
when it easily breez.ed by the 0- 11 
Cham in ade University before 
being handed a loss by top-ranked 
Brigham Young University of 
Hawai i. 

The Tritons enjoyed a Hawaiian 
road trip over spring break, starting 
off with a 9-0 route of Chaminade 
Inl lonolulu, Hi . 

UCSD, ranked 21st, won every 
set en route to improving to 12Â· 1 
on the season. 

Tritons Sameer C hopra and 
Bryan Swan started UCSD off on 
the right foo t for No. I doubles, 
dispatching the Kieran and 
Mi chael McCartney brother duo 
8-0. 

Jeff Wilson and Everett 
Schroeter followed up with a 8-1 
doubles victory in the No . 2 
match, and Mike Meyer and Dan 
Albrecht closed out the doubles 
sweep for UCSD with an 8-0 shel -
lacking of 'Swords Lance Tanouye 
and Nick Alcover. 

Chopra excelled again in No. I 
singles play, taking out Lawrence 
Chan 6-0, 6 -2. 

Swatt, not to be outdone, fol -
lowed up C hopra's performance 
with a 6-3, 6-3 straight-set victory 
over Kieran McCartney. 

Wi Ison extended the 
McCartney brothers' horrible day, 
sweeping Michael McCartney 6Â· 
3, 6-2 in the No. 3 singles 
matchup. 

Blake Wi lson-Hayden, Emil 
ovak and Schroeter all followed 

with straight-set victories of their 
own when UCSD won 96 out of a 
total 119 games played . 

'l\vo days later, the Tritons faced 
off against the undefeated BYU-
Hawaii in Laic, Hi ., in what was 
quite a different matchup than their 
previous opponent. 

Chopra, ranked 44th in the 
na tion at No. 1 singles, was 
matched up against Jan Krejci, 
rhe second-ranked singles player 
in Division II. Krejci dispatched 
C hopra with a straight-set win, 6-
3, 6-3 . 

Scasiders' No . 2 singles player 
Hung Soon Park bui lt 011 Krej ci's 

ierery and added to BYU's 
1II0mentum with a 6-2, 7-5 vict0-
f\ over Swan. Wilsoll battled 
with Andrew Makarevich in the 
~o. 3 clual, however, after win-
III ng the first set Wilson couldn't 
maintain the lead and dropped 
the 6-7, 6-0,7-6 decision . 

Novak earned the sole singles 
win for the Tritons, outlasting 
Daoud. Ndiaye in a three-set bat-
tle, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4. 

The only other UCSD win 
came in the No. 3 doubles match 
when Meyer and Albrecht earned 
an 8-5 victory over Makarevich and 
Ndiayc. 

However, that would be all for 
the Tritons, as their 2-7 loss 
dropped thcm to 12-2 while BYU-
Hawaii improved to 15-0. 

Thc Tritons concluded their 
island swing last Thursday aga inst 
H awaii Pacific University, but at 
press time results for the match 
were unavailable. UCSD next 
takes on Gustavus Adolphus on 
Friday at 2 p.m. at the North 
lennis Courts.

MONDAY. APRIL 1. 2002 

Volleyball : 
After three losses UCSD 
now 5- 19 overall 
Continued from ,.. 1] 
to the rafters. perhaps trying to 
make up for Casey Jacobsen and 
the men's basketball team's poor ' 
postseason showing. 

UCSD fought hard. and 
despite intense pressure from a 
Stanford attack led by Kurt 
Toppel and his 15 kills. the 
Tritons managed to make the first 
two games relatively close. losing 
30-24 in the first and 30-23 in the 
second. 

The Tritons tired in the third 
game and were unable to k.eep up 
with the Cardinal offense that went 
.464 for the match. UCSD lost. 30-
20. and the Cardinal swept the 
match 3-0. 

Kevin Keyser had seven kills for 
the TritOns and hit the ball well . 
marking a .636 hitting percentage. 

tan ford was able to stymie much 
of the UCSD attack. however. and 
not one Triton broke 10 kills for 
the evening. 

The three losses drop UCSD to 
5- 19 overall and 1-18 in the 
Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation. 

The Tritons will meet 
University of La Verne on April 6 
at RIMAC Arena. This is the 
beginning of a four-game homes-
tand that will culminate in the last 
horne game of the year against 
Califurnia Baptist University un 
April 13. 

Then the Tritons will go to the 
MPSF championships. where the 
toughest teams in the na tion will 
battle it out for the right to go to 
the National Collegia te Athletic 
As oeiation and compete for a 
national championship. 

Baseball: 
Tritons disproving pre-
season poll 
Continued from page 21 
Alex Cremidan all sha re j team-
high of five wins and have 49, 46 
and 45 strikeouts, respectively. 

J ames Sanders leads UCSD 
relievers with a ' .59 ERA and 
Cremidan leads the sta rters with a 
3. 18 ERA. 

Aiding in the success of the 
team, the UCSD offense has been 
extremely consistent. The Tritons 
are outÂ·hitting their opponents 
.2 93 to .279 and are also outscoring 
thei r opponents 2 12 to 155. 

Among the offensive l eaders 
are senior second baseman 
Anthony Lococo, who has a .338 
batting average. and junior center 
fie lder Matt Smith. who is hitting 
.3 5 2 and has accum ulated 29 runs. 
25 RBIs lInd 45 hits so far this 
year. 

Third baseman Ryan Larson 
tops the squad with six home runs. 
while designated hitter Jeff Riddle 
fo ll ows close behind with four 
homers. 

Junior left fielder JolUl Bologna 
leads the team on the base paths 
with 18 walks and 18 steals. 

With 16 league games remainÂ· 
ing, UCSD is confident and is 
ready to face the rest of the compeÂ· 
tition this year. 

The Tritons kick off the spring 
season with a four-game home 
stand this week.end against Sonoma 
State University.

Baseball 
continues 
to surprise 
Tritons improve 
to 22-1 1- 1 
By COURTNEY FIELD 
Staff Writer 

Picked [0 finish lOth out of the 
11 teams in the preseason 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association poll, the UCSD base-
ball team continues to prove its 
critics wrong and currently sits 
high atop the CCAA standings. 

During the break, the Tritons 
won two series to capture second 
place in the CCAA. UCSD took 
three of four games from Grand 
Canyon Univers.ity and later took 
two of three from San Francisco 
State University on a four-game 
road trip. The Tritons were 22-11-
1 heading into Sunday's final game 
against San Francisco State. At 
press time, results were unavailable 
from that game. 

The Tritons have vastly 
improved from their sixth-place 
finish last year due [0 a seasoned 
pitching staff and some new inte-
gral bats in the lineup. 

Senior hurlers John Beaven and 
Keith Smith and junior pitcher

event. Kathy Read followed in lit 
12th with a time of 10:27.94 and 
Lindsey Stalker took 16th with a 
mark of 10:40.74. 

In the field, Megan Bergin 
took 12th in the women's ham-
mer throw with a mark of 
165'02". 

The men did not fare as well, 
finishing 22nd with four points out 
of over 25 squads. 

The top showing on the day for 
the Tritons was Rob Ewanio's 
sixth-place finish in the shot put 
with a dis tance of 57'02.75. 
Ewanio, who has already qualified 
for nationals in the shot put, would 
have qualified again with that 
marlc. 

Julian Nahan and Steve Martin 
finished lOth and 16th, respective-
ly, in the 3,OOO-meter steeple-

Volleyball finds life on the road tough over break 
After finishing 4-4 during eight-game homestand, Tritons lose to Pepperdine, Standford and UOP 
By TAIl MILLER 
Associate Sports Editor 

Men's volleyball trave led 

for them. Pepperdine was riding a 
five-match winning streak enter-
ing the match and had handily 
defeated UCSD earlier in the sea-
son. 

Jim Waller had 15 kills to lead 
UCSD for the match. As a team, 
the Tritons hit just .1B5, and on the 
defensive side they weren't able to 
get anything going, recording zero 
blocks for the game. 

close match , this match was any-
thing but , and UeSD lost the 
first twO games 30- 19 and 30-22 . 
T he Tritons again failed to get 
anything going earl y in the 
match. 

upstate over spring break, and 
despi te some strong efforts 
against Pepperdi ne University, 
Stanford University and 
University of the Pacific, UCSD 
came away wi th three losses. 

After an eight-game homes-
tand in which it went 4-4, UeSD 
left the comforta ble confi nes of 
RIMAC Arena to meet 
Pepperdine in Malibu on March 
16. 

Playing in the always hostile 
environment of the Firestone 
Fieldhouse, the Tritons had trouble 
in the first game and the team's 
slow start all owed Pepperdine to 
cruise to a 30-2 1 victory. 

Pepperdine was paced by Sean 
Rooney, who hit .700 and had 15 
kills. The Waves hit .526 as a tea m 
and had seven service aces on the 
evening. 

The two-game deficit ignited a 
little spark within the Tritons and 
they were able to make the third 
game a seesaw battle before losing 
30-2B. 

The Waves are the No. 2-
ranked team in the country, and 
the Tritons had their work cut out 

The second game brought more 
of the same, and UCSD again had 
trouble getting on track, falling 30-
20. While the third game proved 
more entertaining for UCSD - the 
team put up qui te a fight - the result 
was the same: a loss, 30-2B, allowing 
tile Waves to sweep the match 3 -0. 

After a break for fi nals, UeSD 
resumed its road crip, traveling to 
Stockton for a rematch with 
UOP. The Tritons had played 
Pacific on March 2 and were hop-
ing to come up on the winning 
side this time. 

Despite the precedent fo r a 

The Tritons again had trouble 
getting good looks at the ball and 
hit .134. However, Waller had 21 
kills and two aces for the match. 
Three UCSD players had negative 
hitting percentages and no one 
besides Waller had more than four 
kills.

Aaron Watchfogel, with 12 kills, 
led a Tigers attack that saw three 
players get to double digits in kills. 
The team hit .400 for the night and 
smothered the Triton attack with 
13.5 blocks. 

UCSD then traveled to Palo 
Alto, Calif. for a match with 
Stanford. Two weeks ago, UCSD 
took the Cardinal to five games in

strong by scrambling out of the 
hole they built for themselves -
that took a huge commitment 
from them," McGihun said . "\,ve 
just need to have the fi rst two

On the men's side of the pool, 
junior Luke Seed and frc,hlll an 
Devin Spicer paced UCSD. 

Spicer, the Tritons' distance 
specialist, scored points in the 
1000-yard freestyle, the SOD-yard 
freestyle and the 1650-yard

Like the women, the men's team 
also benefited from strong swim -

The Tritons scored points in 
five different relay events, grab-

11 th in the 200-yard freestyle, 
15th in the 400-yard medley relay 
and eighth in the BOO-yard 
freestyle. 

"I was really happy with the 
men's results - it's probably a pret-
ty fair representation of where we 
should be," McGihon said. 

McGihon was pleased with his-
teams' chemistry and attitude, but 
has higher expectations for next 
year's tea ms. 

"Overall , we definitely accom-
plished our goals for the season. 
Now that we've achieved those .. 
goals, we need to make new goals as 
to where we should be," he aid . 
"We just need to bring our perfor-

The UCSD softball team 
dropped seven consecutive 
games between March 15 and 
March 3 I. 

The TritOn squad, which 
once held the top spot in 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association standings, has fallen 
back to fourth place wi th a 12 -I 0 
conference record and a 20-14 
record overa II.

This year, head coach Patti 
Gerckens' team boasts an 
impressive 10-2 record at home 
during CCAA play, but has 
struggled on the road, going 2-8. 
Those road woes were never 
more painful than during a pair 
of shutout losses March 16 at 
UC Davis. 

The wins helped the Aggies 
pass the Tritons in the standings 
and the two teams headed in dif-
ferent directions. UC Davis is 
currently riding a seven-game 
winning streak to the top of the 
CCAA, while UCSD has 
dropped seven and hopes to 
regain its footing in the stand-
ings. 

Despite tough times, the 
Tritons remain optimistic. 

"Right now, I think that we're 
at the greatest place a losing team 
could be," said senior left-fielder 
Kristina Anderson. "Everyone is 
trying so hard . T hings just aren't 
clicking for us." 

The statistics would seem to 
suggest the effort is there, since 
the Tritons lead the CCAA with a 
.969 fielding percentage. They 
are also fourth in earned run aver-
age and second in batting ,average. 

Sophomore third baseman 
Amy Mettee suggested the wins 
will come with time, bur admitted 
the loss.es take a toll. 

"Every time you lose, its frus-
trating," he said. "Losing is 
never easy, but we haven't 10 t 
confidence. Every great team 
goes through difficulties and 
challenges, but that makes you 
better." 

Despite current struggles as a 

team, a few UC D players are 
posting outstanding seasons. 
Mettee is among the CCAAS top 
five in batting average, slugging 
percentage, on-base percentage , 
runs scored, stolen bases, total 
bases. doubles and hits. She was 
selected CCAA Player of the 
Week for March 10. 

Anderson benefitted from 
Menee being on base because 
she ranks in the CCAA top five 
for RBIs. 

Senior pitcher Christi 
Martinelli has also had a stellar 
year, going 12-6 thus far with an 
earned run average below twO 
whi le she al 0 leads the CCAA in 
strikeouts. She was named 
CCAAS pitcher of the week for 
March 10. 

As they struggle through the 
middle of their season, the 
Tritons look to regai n the form 
that led them to a 13 - 1 start. 

T he Tritons sti ll have two 
tournaments, the West Region 
Champions Tourney and the Mt. 
Dew C lassic, as well as 10 con-
ference games left (four at 
horne) against Cal State 
Stanislaus, CSU Bakersfield, 
CSU Dominguez Hills, Sonoma 
State and San Francisco State 
universities, the TritOns will 
have plenty of opportunities to 
put their season back in the right 
direction. 

They also will host rival 
Univer~ity of San Diego in 
exciting inter-San Diego action . 
The team still remains a confi-
dent bunch . 

"We still don't doubt that we'll 
make it to the top," Menee said.

Parking solution 
found underground 
Over 1000 'S' spaces to be created 
By ALICIA AICILA 
Junior Staff Transcriber 

In a surprise announcement 
ye terday, CSD administration 
unveiled plans to construct an 
underground parking structure on 
campus, to be opened in fa ll 2003 . 

The structure will be located 
beneath Lot P604, which is at the 
corner of Gilman Drive and Osler 
Lane and is referred to by some 
students as "the pit." All 1,027 
spots within the six-level strucnlre 
will be marked "S" for students. 

The structure, which was 
designed by students of the Jacohs 
School of Engineering, is assured 
to be of the highest quality, 
according to Chancellor Robert C. 
Dynes. but only recently became 
feas ible. 

"Well, I've wanted to do some-
thing like this for the students for 
some time," Dynes said. 
"Forn1l1ately, events and situations 
finally coincided in such a way as to 
allow me to act on my plan." 

What spurned the desire for a 
new structure, Dynes explained, 

wa a growing awareness that fig-
ures from Transportation and 
Parking ServIces were incorrect 
and students did not, in fact, have 
adequate parking on campus. 

"I personally love each and 
every one of the snldents of UCSD 
and would sacrifice anything for 
their happiness," Dynes said. 

T&PS director Ivana Scruya 
refuted the need for the structure, 
saying UCSD already has ample 
parking for students. 

"Studies have shown time and 
tllne again that a 500-to-one ratio 
i entirely appropriate for student 
parking," she said . "You snldenrs 
are all just a bunch of whiny fucks." 

Instead of the construction of 
the new strucnlre, Scruya advocat-
ed a plan wherein students walked 
to campus no matter what the dis-
tance, availed themselves of the 
city's "highly reliable and conve-
nient" public transportation sys-
tem. 

Student reaction to the con-
struction of the new structure has

Supercomputer Center

Social Sciences bumped to portable 
By J.D. AnERTON 
Editorial Assistant 

The San Diego Supercomputer 
Center will expand into the Social 
Sciences Building this summer, 
forcing current SSB tenants to 
move aero s campus. The news 
came Thursday in an all-campus e-
mail from C hancellor Robert C. 
Dvne.

for professors, teaching assistants and

Sciences will now be housed in this

various departments will be renovat-
ed into larger. more spacious offices 
for computer scientists and techni-
cians at SDSC. The current offices 
inside the center will be remodeled 
to make room for more computers. 

The Division of Social Sciences 
will be relocated to the current 
Regents Road parking lots on East 
campus, according the e-mail. 

The decision has irked many 
professors whose offices are located 
in the four-story building next to 
RIMAC Arena and the SDSC. 

"I don't understand the thought 
process behind the move," said 
Richard Peterson, an anthropology 
professor. "This is the latest in a long 
line of disrespectful actions taken 
against the social sciences on this 
campus. I bet you $20 money had 
something to do with this." 

It did. 
Dynes explained while he drank 

a dry martini at the Faculty Club. 
"The decision came after hours 

of discussion with industry execu-
tives," he said. "They convinced 
me that the expansion of the SDSC 
was integral to the continued excel-

Dodge cancels elections 
Students rally in support of 'Vacation Coup' 

Andrew Quiebowitz/CuaroHln 
Fondest brother: President Jeff Dodge speaks to loyal followers Saturday in front of Muir college after the successful coup. 
By WINSTON SMITH 
Staff Writer 

A.S. President Jeff Dodge and 
other members of the incumbent 
Unity slate seized control of 
UCSD's student government 
Friday in an unprecedented coup 
d'etat. 

Dozens of burly, armed men 
w!:aring Community Service 
Officer clothing guarded the A.S. 
offices around 4 p.m. while inside 
Dodge and his allies [Ook steps to 
secure their power. 

"They were way bigger than 
any of the CSOs I've seen," said 
Roosevelt freshman Amy 
Nobrillante. "They looked like 
enforcers." 

Dodge suspended the A.S . 
Constitution and canceled the 
upcoming elections, citing ongo-
ing campus security concerns and 
allegations of rampant campaign 
abuse. He also declared that he 
would' sustai n his presidency and 
the terms of 21 other Unity 
council members as long as neces-
sary. 

"By remaining president, I will 
further the slate's goal of campus 
unity," Dodge said in a speech in 
front of the Applied Physics & 
Mathmatics Building after the 
coup's success. "It wi ll take many 
years to accomplish that goal, but 
I will see it through to the end." 

One aspect of Dodge's new 
plan is the "Unity Rally." He plans 
to deliver fiery, pro-UCSD ser-

mons at three rallies per week on 
RIMAC field. Attending at least 
one rally per week will be manda-
tory for students, officials said. 

"If you don't show up, we will 
find out," said new A.S . Minister 
of Student Security Kyle 
Biebesheimer. "And when we find 
out, we will make you pay." 

Biebesheimer was the A.S. stu-
dent advocate under the old gov-
ernment. 

The rallies, according to 
Dodge, are only one part of the 
ongoing campus unity effort. 

"They're just the beginning," 
Dodge sa id. "One plan will guar-
antee affordable on-campus hous-
ing for everyone in exchange for 
their compulsory help in con-
structing the new' science and 
engineering buildings. U ni ty shall 
come without sacrifice." 

Dodge also plans to raze the 
Sun God, a prominent campus 
sculpture, and replace it with a 
comparably sized statue of himself. 

"The Ca/ifo77lia Review com-
pared me and other A.S. execu-
tives to [revolutionary Soviet 
leader] Lenin," Dodge said. "So 
now we 're doing our best [0 meet 
tho e lofty expectations." 

When asked how the new pro-
jects will be funded, Dodge said 
that the A.S. Council plans to 
institute a 1.25 percent "Unity 
tax" on all purchases made at 
UCSD businesses for everything 
from blue books to tuition . 
Billions are expected.

"The community that pays 
together stays together," said A.S. 
Vice President of Finance Sam 
Shooshtary. "It's just one more 
step toward unity." 

Some students are wary of 
Dodge'S increased power, but 
many are optimistically welconllng 
it. 

" I'm not scared," said Marshall 
sophomore Diane Labatt. " If I get 
a loud knock on my door at 3 a. m. , 
I'm pretty certain it will be a 
Unity liaison bringing our suite a 
complimentary six-pack of beer." 

After news broke that Dodge 
had suspended the A.S. 
Constitution, many students 
feared for the nlture of UCSD'~ 
Principles of Community. 

"We have a right to freedom of 
expression at UC SD ," S;l1ll 
Warren junior Elias H owe. "The 
document doesn't say thar we can 
only express agreement WI th what 
Dodge says. " 

Dodge said that anyone CJn 
sil ently disagree with him. a~ long 
as everyone wears the soon-to-hc-
mandatory blue and gold ~llIrts 
with "I Agree With JeW' printed 
on the front . 

Despite the unconventi onal 
extension of his preSIdenti al term , 
Dodge is confident that students 
will support his continued rule. 

"Our campus' acronym says it 
all," he said . " UCSD : The 
University of California Supports 
Dodge. You can't help but agree 
with me."

"Are you shitting me?" Muir junior 
lOca Lon said upon hearing the news. 
"That IS hellafied shibby, yo." 

Roosevelt Freshman Doan Laymi 
was similarly enthusiastic. 

"ThiS school would Iond of suck 
less Ir I could find a place to park," he 
said. "Maybe now I won't throw 
myself under the wheels of an oncom-

Funding for the new SITucturc has 
been secured despite cuts in tate 
fUnlhng of the University of 
California. Numba Kruncha, a finan-
cial analyst for the chancellor, said 
this was achieved through "creative 
reallocations. 

"Well , you know, we moved 
money here and there, and made 
some strategic reductions in extrane-
ous expendirures," she said. 

Essentially, the plan entails ule 
wholesale reassignment of many key 
staff positions to offices Out of the 
country. 

All positions in the Office of 
Adn issions, the Office or the 
Registrar and the college academic 
advismg offices, ~lll1ong others, have 
been reassigncd to fa ctories in 
Tijuana. 

Kruncha said this plan had myri-
ad benefits, the least of which was 
decreased spending on sa laries due 
to the lack of minimum wage 
requirements across the border. 

"In an era of increasing globaliza-
tion.IUCSD] must be a vigorous par-

Philip Morris Co. donates $200,000 for research 

Philip Morris Company announced that it 
intends to sponsor two full-time facu lty positions 
at UCSD that are integral in its support of higher 
education. 

The School of Medicine will receive $100,000 
per year for the next 10 years to fund a position 
to study the health benefits of smoking. Dr. Ralph 
Wiggins, a researcher who is a world-renowned 
expert on lungs, will conduct a study of college 
age smokers. He will desperately search for a 
connection between smoking and benefits, no 
matter how minor. 

The communications department will also 
receive $100,000 per year over the next six years to 
research covert and effective ways to advertise to 
children. Professor Bill McNeil will conduct a study 
of the effects cartoon and sports ads have on the 
buying habits of youth. 

Scri~~s announces advance in 
ampl1ibious feline research 

SCientists at the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography last week unveiled a major step for-
ward in the emerging field of amphibious feline 
engineering. 

The 510 program aims to make it possible for 
cats to live underwater indefinitely. Before slO's 
latest experimentation was made public, the 
longest a cat had stayed underwater was six hours, 
22 minutes. The SCriPPS study, however, had one 
cat living in a 20-gallon fish tank for 35 hours. 

The unprecedented feline submersion was 
made possible through a face mask designed to sur-
round the cat's head in a n airtight bubble, which 
was then attached by a hose to a scuba-like breath-
ing tank. The scientists said this was a major 
improvement over early efforts in underwater cat 
program technology, when the cats' heads were 
duct-taped into Tupperware, 

PETA was initially upset over the experiments, 
but soon got over themselves. 

Dates for graduation

Child pornography raid hits 
UCSD offices and apartments 

Yesterday at 8 a.m. agents from the FBI, UCsD 
Police and the San Diego Police Department raided 
apartments and offices throughout UCSD as part of 
a nationwide antichild pornography campaign 
dubbed Operation Priesthood. 

Computers from the Office of Religious Services, 
Challenger Hall dorms in Revelle College, Student 
Center media lounge, and CLiCs were taken for 
investigation. 

No arrests were made, as the offices and resi, 
dences were vacated during the raid. It is thought 
that most targets were tipped off by an inside 
source prior to the raid,

PEDDLING 

ON LIBRARY WALK 
The A.S. Council's pro-pornography stance causes 
consternation for morality-minded students 

By DANIEL BEDINGFIELD 
Contributing Writer 

Ask most UCS D students what 
they thi nk of when you say the 
phrase "Library Walk," and "porn" 
is li kel y to bc the response - at 
least ever si nce the 200 1-2 002 A.S. 
Counci l took office. As many have 
noted with varyi ng degrees of dis-
gust, this year's A.S. C ouncil has 
been a fervent supporter of the di s-
tribution of pornographic media on 
campus. 

Accordin g to A.S. President Jeff 
Dodge, the dissemination of Las 
Vega -styl e porn leaflets on Library 
Walk helps to raise fun ds for A.5.-
fu nded events. Escort services, stri p 
cl ubs and exotic dancers' agencies 
pay the A.S . Council to distribute 
the porn in highl y visible locations 
on ca mpus. A.S. budget reports 
indica te that the advertising has 
ge nera ted reve nu e this year 
amounti ng to an extra $2, 192,000 
for campuswide events and student 
programllling. 

To those who must contend 
With rhe porn traffi ckers on 
Library Walk, however, the distri -
butIOn' of pornography is a full -
np. dged attack on morali ty and 
commo n decency. T he lea fl ets lit-
ter the hallowed srones of Li brary 
Walk, clog the Price Center foun -
tain, and swirl through rhe air all 
over campus on windy days. Once, 
I e"en round a leaflet stealmil y 
rllcked into my rear jean pocket, no 

doubt placed m ere by some pruri-
en t purveyor of porn ographi c 
pu trescence. 

T his is to say nothing of the 
threat to decency that the porn dis-
tributors themselves present. 
When I stumble down Library 
W alk :It 11 a.m. on a Monda y, 
bleary-eyed and groggy, I don't 
want to be greeted with me sight of 
our student council members solic-
iting me for sexual services, me 
sharp crack of leaflet on leaflet 
resounding through the morning 
air as they peddle meir wares. 

Just three weeks ago, I was met 
wi th the distasteful and lascivious 
hoots of Dod ge as he extended a 
Dream Girls fi yer in my direction . 
J looked away, embarrassed, when I 
caught A.S. Commissioner of 
Communications Catherine Algeri 
leering suggestively at me and mak-
ing all sorts of comments about my 
virility. And I could have sworn that 
I saw A.S. Commissioner of 
Services and Enterprises Colin 
Parent checking out my ass. 

Shouldn't the A.S. Council be 
holed up somewhere in the Price 
Center, passing pro-America reso-
lutions or something? Granted, 
many students probably find satis-
faction in me A.S. Council 's new 
twi st on "serving the students' 
needs," but this is ridiculous. Keep 
m e porn off Library Walk, and 
leave it where it belongs - on lab 
compute r screclH and under dorm 
beds all over ea m pus. 

MONDAY, APRIL I, 2002 

O K, ladies. How many times have you 
sat around with your gi rl -

friends complaining about how 
UCSD lacks any dateable men' O r 
if any do exist, they must travel in 
packs and hide somewhere, conve-
niently out of our sight? 

I am proud to say that I have 
finally found their hiding place. 

After two-and-a-quarter years of 
waiting, hoping, searching, praying 
and - in moments of weakness -
stalking, I had all but given up on 
the idea of Triton love. That is, until 
I discovered the spot where all the 
hot, irresistible, they-gotta -be-
from-State UCSD men frequent. 
No, it 's nOI in the Gaslamp; it', on 
the Revelle campus, and It 's ca lled 
CLUB C LIX. 

oW, I know what I'ou're think-
ing: CLlCS is a plact! ;vltll piercing 
fio llresccnt l ight~ ami deluded 
UCSD students who mink thel' will 
acnlally get some studying 'done 
there. But we all know it's much 
more man tllat - it is, indeed, ule 
place to see and be seen, and it 
embraces this notion every Saturday 
at midnight, when CLUB CLL'\" 
o pens its doors. 

The C LIC to C LL', transfor-
mation is laudable. Refreshingly 
devoid of those computer terminals 
that get in tile way of sociali zing in 
the firs t place, the two- torey cl ub i, 
accented with coa t-a nd-b'lckpack 
check-in , dim lighting and a fu ll -
service bar, tended by referee-shirt-
wearin' Zebras. After a much-need-
ed apple maro m (in classic UCSD 
style , it consisted of more apple than 
martin i - but whatever), I headed 
upstairs, "ia elevator. 

Now, at CLUB CLIX YOll can 
still catch your daytime rCb'lllar, : 
the resident Revelle freshman who 
still thinks it's cute to venture out of 
her room in her pa jamas; th al old . 
pseudo-teacher who conducts some 
sort of study session on randolll 
nights in me first-fl oor computer 
lounge; me we're-really-unattrac-
tive-but-we're-going-to-make-out-
an ywa y- beca use-we - thin k -we ' re-
CU te-bu t -we 're-inducin g-volll i t -for-
onlookers coupl e, who insist on 
smooching by the magazine rack.s; 
and that guy. You know who I'm 
talking abollt - he strolls in around 
10 every other night (severely ('vcr-
dressed), makes his rounds, checks 
his e-mail, grabs some coffee and 
leaves around 11 :30 p.m. Well, they 
were still there, except (and pardon 
the "Zoolander" expression), they 
were all really, really, ridiculously 
good-looking. 

There must be something in that 
CLICS tap water. Yes, the afore-
mentioned Zebra bartenders unbut-
toned meir uniforms a bit; the ever-
present teacher served as the 
buffed-up doorman, and as for those 
people who are there so often , you 
swear CLICS is charging them rent 
- well, they were still there, and 
now occupied the coveted Vl P 
lounges (formerly, "study rooms"). 

Maybe it's the dark ambience 
that makes it virtually impossible to 
see anyone in the first place, but 
people at CLUB CLIX, especially 
the UCSD men (gasp I) were 
extremely hot. I spent a splendid 
three hours dancing with men who, 
come sunlight, went back to their 
books and IUd behind their IBM 
safety zones. The same boys who 
only leave their CLiCS cubicles to 
take their biweekly showers - the 
same guys who make female Tritons 
cry and take unnecessary trips to the 
SDSU campus to remind ourselves 
what the oppo ite sex is sllppo>cd to 
be like.

Escort service 
helps lame~asses 
like you get dates 
By SWEET E. PYE 
What do you want it to be? 

For any girl wh o's ever said 
"you'll have to pay me to go to 
another frat party," a new opportu-
nity has just opened up. 

H eidi Ho and John Finkle, twO 
enterprising Warren sophomores, 
have opened up The Company of 
Strangers, a campus escort service. 

"It just seemed to make perfect 
sense," Ho said. "Students are 
always looking for attractive, fun, 
outgoing girls to accompany them 
to parties. Yet committed relation-
ships aren't what students wam. An 
escort service was the beSt solution." 

Fin.lde po inted to UCSD stu -
dents' academic commitment a one 
reason for their company's creation. 

"There really was a trt! mendous 
demand III the dati ng service mar-
ket," Fi nkl e sa id. "Everyone know 
that UCS D students a~e too bus)' 
to go out and find their own da tes." 

When asked why students 
would want to pay for something 
the)' can get for free , Finkle was 
qu ick to explai n, "Oh, these aren't 
just UCSD girls. We'l'e hired many 
ladies from [San Diego) State." 

Ho also added, "i\<lan )' UCS D 
s tuden t~, espeCiall y Revelle stu-
dents, don't have the aesthetic or 
interpersonal sk.ill to attract the 
rype of women they ca n ge t 
through our service." 

Ho, a criti<:al gender studies 
major, does not have trouble rec-
onciling her feminist ideology with 
her business venture. 

"It's simply paying women for 
work mat has long gone unpaid ," 
110 said. " Everyone kno ws that 
sometimcs dates' can be a chore, 
hnt if the guy~ get I he gi rl they 
want, and the girls are paid for 
thei r labor, everyone's happy. " 

Dr. Abe Stan ' anee, professor 
of sociology and author o f the book 
" ' iVhy Men are Pigs." said it is not 
un COllllllon for young men to turn 
to the sex industry. and that urge 
may begin in childhood. 

Nance cited a 1984 st'lldy that 
showed a phenomenon among 
grade schoolers who solicited ki sses 
from female ci;Jssmatcs during 
recess and lunch breaks: "Boys arc 
socialized from a young age to pur-
sue women and business aggressive-
ly," Nance said. "It is easy for them 
to get the two mIXed up along the 
way." 

'Ho and Finklc are adamant that 
their company does nor and will 
not offer sexual services. 

"The ladies are under strict 
orders to never take money for 
sex," Ho said. "Each girl is given a 
can of pepper spray just to be safe." 

However, "Daniclle," who asked 
not to be identified by her real 
name in fear that her older brother 
may read this, said differently. 

"We were told we just couldn't 
accept extra money for sex," she 
said . "We charge johns a flat fee, 
and whatever happens on me date 
is up to our discretion." 

When asked if she ever engaged 
in a sex act while out on a job, 
Danielle said, "Sex is a sacred thing 
that should only happen wimin the 
bonds of marriage - or another 
contracted agreement involving 
monetary exchange. You 're damn 
right 1 have." 

While school administrators arc 
skeptical of me new campus busi-
ness, they say their hands are tied . 

"Apparently La Jolla has no 
statute against date-hiring," said 
Chancellor Robert Dynes. "\Ve're 
very suspicious, but our cfforts have 
not nnned up anything iIIegaJ yet."

Actually, I was just contemplating how curi-
ous i t is that the societies of Africa never 
developed the dominance of those of 
Europe, although their access to natural 
resources was naturally at parity with those 
of the Europeans. 

Bush would go down like a pansy in twO 
kicks. I say put Powell in - that man must 
have nuts of steel to be able to serve under a 
presjdent as moronic as Dubya. 

I'm not aware that there are any humorous 
publ ications at UCSD. 

Of course. After all, they're the ones who 
told him not to use any lube. 

Will th is be on my structural biochem

That in my country, anyone publishing such

Triton 
mascot to 
be changed 
Watson drops 
'Triton' for 
'Lab researcher' 
By JACQUES STRAP 
UCSD supporter 

UCSD Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs joseph Watson 
announced last week that UCSD 
will change its ofticial mascot. 

\-Vatson said the decision was 
re'lched III the wake of San Diego 
St.lle Ul1Iverslty's recent decision to 
.lIter It~ Azte~ ma cot, "Manry 
. \\onteZllma," into a "cultural 
ambassador" instead of a m3scot. 
CahforI1I<I Collegiate Athletic 
Association rival Sonoma tate 
University made a similar decision 
to drop "Cossack" as its official 
logo in favor of "Sea ' Volves." 

"I think there is definite need 
for a change," Watson said. 
", obody knows or care what a 
Tn ton is. 'Ve need something more 
suitable and pertinent to our presti-
gious university." 

'Vat~on announced that after 
long deliberanon between himself 
,md others in his office, lJCSD's 
new mascot would be "Laboratory 
Researcher. " 

The chief purpose of the mascot 
will be to represent the srudents. 
The UCSD Laboratory Researcher 
mascot will be a Caucasian male. He 
will wear a lab coat and refuse to 
support UCSD athletics. 
Addi tionally, the Laboratory 
Researcher will (two ou( of every 
three times) rarely or never have sex 
with a date who has been drinking. 

"H aving Labby as our mascot is a 
definite improvement," Watson said. 
"It will hopefully show my - I mean 
0111' - dedication to academics and 
research and generate donations from 
our alumni in the science fields." 

Watson mentioned a deliberate 
disregard to undergraduate stu-
dents, especially those outside sci-
ence majors, in his deCision. 

"I don't care about the political 
science, communications or litera-
ture majors," he said. "They rarely 
get high-paying jobs that allow 
them to donate large amounts of 
money. Hopefully this will cause a 
lot of nonscience majors to transfer 
our of here." 

'Nhen questioned about the 
effectiveness of a well-supported ath-
letic program in creating pride and 
loyalty among snldents who poten-
tially could result in alumni dona-
tions later, Watson didn't respond 
because he was busy with the beer 
garden he con fisca ted from the 
UCSD-UC Davis basketball game. 

The change drew a tepid reac-
tion among the snldent body. 

"I would personally never go to 
an athletic event," said Revelle 
junior Sarah Kim. "But I think it's 
cool the administration is finally 
letti ng everyone know they don't 
care about athletics." 

Addi tionally, according to 
Watson, the new mascot would save 
UCS D money since "the 
Laboratory Researcher" wouldn't 
be able to attend games Monday, 
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, 
Friday or Sunday nights due to 
prior studyi ng commitments.

Title IX repealed by u.s. Supreme Co u rt 
Women's sports ended, teams now open to both genders 
By OLIVER CLOTHESOFF 
Staff Writer 

The U.S. Supreme Cou rt 
dealt a major blow Friday to the 
futu re of women's sports when it 
repea led the Ti tl e IX amend-
ment that req uires eq ual oppor-
tunity for male and female ath-
letes : The ame ndment, which 
was passed in 1972, was abol -
ished by a 5-4 vote in the case of 
Da1yle v. (It/ollal Collegiate 
Athletic Association. 

Chief j usti ce William 
Rehnquist wrote the majority 
opinion . 

"Women's sPOrts are boring," 
the report stares. "No self-
rt:specnng male wants to watch 
women's sports because it's 
painful knowing that the comedy 
of errors being exhibited is not an 
atte mpt at comedy, but rather a 
misguided effort that mocks the 
very fabric of ollr sportin~ cul-
ture ." 

justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
voted with the majority bllt left 
the chambers crying, claiming 
she'd felt pressured to vote the 
way she did. 

President Gt:orge W. Bush 
held a news conference to discuss 
the rul ing, during which he tOld 
the nation that democracy had 
been served. 

"Even if you people don't like 
what this will do to sports, these 
justices are the people that you 

people have elected to be the peo-
ple who represent the people," 
Bush said. 

After being rold by one of I,is 
advisers that justices are not elect-
ed, but rather appointed by the 
president, Bush furrowed his brow 
and proceeded to repeat one of his 
speeches from Sept. 11 . The con-
fused president stressed that 
"America will come out stronger" 
and that "the search is underway 
for those who are behind this evil 
act." 

At the local level, the decision 
caught the UCS D administration 
by surprise, but they tried to spin 
it as best they could. 

"Well. I don't like athle tics 
anyway," aid Vice Chancellor of 

tudent Affairs Joseph Watson . 
"So if the Supreme Court wants to 
destroy half of UCSD's athletic 
program, it just saves me the trOu-
ble." 

'lNhen asked what the fi.mding 
formerly used on women's sports 
would go toward, Watson replied 
that "executive conferences" and 
"administrative salaries" were pri-
ori ties for him. 

UCSD Athletic Director Earl 
Watson tried to see the Qright side 
of the ruling. 

"I actually think that this elim-
inates sexism," he sa id. "If we 
don't separate it into a women 's 
team and a men's team, we can 
simply say that this is the UCSD 
team and the best athletes will

play, regardless of gender. I think 
that's fair. " 

Female TritOn basketball play-
er Ali Ginn agreed. 

"I don't think this decision 
really affects me all that much 
because we're bener than the guys 
team anyway," Ginn said. 

While many people tried to 
stay diplomatic on the issue, ten-
sions ran high in Washington , 
D.C., where female protesters 
blocked several blocks of traffic 
while demonstrating against the 

decision . 
Male protesters also came car-

rying mocking signs that read 
"It's abollt time," "Go have 
babies" and "Quit whining and 
cook my dinner." T he protesters 
entered into several confronta-
tions but no major injuries were 
reported . 

A.S. Commissioner of Ath letics 
Robin Shelton had the final word 
on the situation. 

"UC Davis Slicks," Shelton 
said. 

Athletic director to restructure sports 
Plans for basketball to move back to Division III, soccer up to Division I 
By AL COHOLIC 
Sports Editor 

UCSD Athletic Director Earl 
Edwards announced Friday that 
due to budget concerns, the 
UCSD athletics program will be 
forced to undergo changes for the 
2002 -2003 school year. 

Several of the major changes in 
the "Dissembling UCSD Sports" 
plan involve restructuring teams 
and even cutting certain teams in 
order to free up more money for 
other teams. 

"It's a tough position," 
Edwards said. "Obviously I wish I 
wasn't forced to do this, but the 
fact is that 1 am." 

Several of the teams Edwards is 
looking at cutting include track 
and field, fencing, men 's and 
women's crew, and golf, among 
others. 

"I feel that these teams get the 
least support among students," 
Edwards said. "And in this tOugh 
situation I think all we can do is 
focus on the teams that are well-
supported and are competitive." 

Tall Tritons: With the proposed move back to Division III, the Tritons will return 
to facing midget amputees like this player from Redlands University. 

Edwards wi ll also try reorga-
nizing several teams to help the 
budget and stoke the student 
body's interest. 

He is currently looking at mov-
ing the men's basketball team back 
to Division III and hopes to com-
pensate that move by transferring 
the women's soccer team to 
Division 1. 

"I think if our men's basket-
ball team went back to Division 
III and started beating everybody 
by 100 points again there would 
be a definite response among the 
student body," Edwards said . 
"Instead of having our state-of-
the-art arena sparsely filled with 
about 50 fans watching our team 
lose 20 games a year, we could 
have it full of happy supporters, 
resulting in more games like this 
year's game against Redlands 
[which UCSD won 104-44J." 

In addition, his goal to move 
the UCSD women's soccer team 
to Division I would generate rev-
enue from television contracts and 
sponsorships. 

"We moved from Division III 
to Division II, and we sti ll won the 
national championship," Edwards 
said. "I truly feel we could win at 
the Division I level, and the sensa-
tion caused by this transfer would 
be key in attracting sponsorships 
and media contracts." 

Men's basketball head coach 
Greg Lanthier was pleased at the 
prospect of rerurning to Division 
ill. 

"Unlike Division II, III 

Division III the teams don't quite 
outsize us by so much," he said. 
"This wi ll allow us to shoot threes 
a lot easier. These last few years 
I've been forced to somewhat hold 
back and actua lly go inside a few 
times each game, now J can give 
my shooters the green light from 
behind the arc all game." 

Triton basketball player Ryan 
Swed agreed with his coach. 

"A couple of players were wor-
ried ea rl ier this year that our 
offense was one-dimensional," he 
said. "We just kept pounding the 
ball inside play after play and every-
body knew what we were going to 
do. This move would allow us to 
focus more on our outside game, 
because as everyone knows, a three-
pointer is more than a two-pointer, 
so we obviously want to shoot as 
many threes as we can." 

Women's soccer player Megan 
Mendoza also looked forward to 
some new competition. 

"We kicked everyone's ass in 
Division III, then kicked every-
one's ass in Division II," she said. 
"Logically, this is the next step to 
take. I'm looking forward to kick-
ing everyone's ass in Division I. " 

Among the sUldent body, the 
reaction to these proposed changes 
- as they are for any sportS-related 
event - was largely indifferent. 

"I reall y don't care," said 
Roosevelt senior Amy Gardine. 
"Why don't they just cut every 
team except for the women's soc-
cer team? That's the only team 
I've ever heard about."
