Editorial 
Time Has Come T odayl 

Tomorrow is a critical day for the University of California and 
academic freedom, for tomorrow there will probably be an attempt 
to usurp the authority of the faculty by depriving them of tho peroga-
tives that are indigenous to the cherished concept of academic freedom. 

It has been part of the standing orders of the Board of Regents since 
1920 that the faculty has the authority over curriculum matters, but 
Governor Rea~n's resolution, which will be considered at this meeting, 
would return this authority to a body of some 24 men who meet once 
a month, then times a year. 

Such a move would place the university under intolerable political 
control, and would for all intents and purposes mean th demise of a 
gTeat and respected institution of hieher learning. 

What should we as students do? Well, one example we cannot afford 
to follow i s that of the Santa Cruz students, who jostled and disrupted 
the Reg-ents in their work last month. A repetition of such incidents 
miCht leave the Re~nts with no otheralternative. However, a dramatic, 
but responsible show of concern and solidarity by students and faculty 
alike might have the desired effect upon the Recents. 

Now i s the time for unity, Let's not have the confusion that splinter 
demonstrations and individual heckling would create. Let's join to-
Itether with the Associated Students and the Faculty Ad Hoc Committee 
and follow their I ad, and the instructions of the monitors they will 
provide. 

For those of you who have wallowed in the mires of apathy during all 
of your college existence, the time has come today. The Triton Times 
urges you to stand up for your university and participate in the 
demonstration to be held tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m. outside the 
itYm, and whatever other activities are planned by our student and 
faculty leaders. 

Hunger Vigil Begins 
At 1 o'clock on the afternoon 

of Tuesday the 19th, MAYA lead-
er Isreal Chavez announced the 
beitinning of a hun er strike by 
MA YA and BSC students to last 
until 5 p.m. Friday. The purpose 
of the strike was to infiuence 
the Reltents to make the Univer-
sity relevant to its community 
and free from political inter-
ference, through, among- other 
things, rejecting the resolution 
proposed by Reagan and the one 
passed on September 30th IImit-
inc guest lecturers to one ap-
pearance. 

A 1tI'0Up of about 150 other stu-
dents and faculty have joined the 
BSC and MAYA in the strike. 
From their headquart r s in Blake 
Loung , the white strik rs have 
organized an inform I ste rinc 
committe to handle publicity, 
press releases, education, and 
whatever problems may arise as 
the 3 day strike prOil'esses. 
Education involve makin the 

strikers experts on the Heltent's 
meeting and then sending team s 
of strikers to the dorms to edu-
cate their residents. 

But most of the students and 
faculty camped out in Blake Hall 
have not had a history of involve-
m nt. Perhaps a quarter had nev-
er done anything like that before. 
Why are they there ? Th y felt 
the need to do more than just 
demonstrate but didn't want to be 
violent. 

The effects of that disappoint-
ment on students who haven't 
eaten for 3 days have caused 
concern among som lead r s of 
the strike and of th AS. Th 
are afraid of the viol nt reaction 
that Isreal Chavez s emed to 
look forw rd to in his speech at 
th Convocation. th r leader , 
how ver, believe that a voluntary 
nonviolent strike will not I ad to 
violence. 

Triton rim s, Friday as usual.

Regents Meet Here 
The Board of Regents is the 

hichest governingbodyofthe Uni-
versity of California. According 
to the ~tate Constitution this 
body of 24 men is invested with 
the power to administer the af-
fairs of the University of Cali-
fornia, which is a public trust. 
Whereas ultimately all authority 
rests with the Regents, they may, 
and have in the past, delegated 
their authority as they have seen 
fit. 
.**.** •••••••• * 

At the September Regen,,, 
meetinc at UC LA a re solution 
was adopted which limits cuest 
lecturers to one appearance in 
any credit course. This was 
brought about largely as a result 
of an experimental course d -
signed by the Committee for 
Participatory Education, at Ber-
keley, in which Eldridge Cleaver 
was to appear ten times. Several 
motions were defeated which 
would have placed more stringent 
controls over courses, one speci-
fically barring Cl aver from an 
appearance on any UC campus. 

At the October meetin~ at San-
ta Cruz the Rei nts voted to 
table any further action on the 
guest lecturer matter until the 
San Oleio meetinc. 

Governor Reagan introduced 
an extensive resolution, which 
provided for Regental control 
over matters traditionally dele-
gated to the faculty. His resolu-
tion would d prive faculty mem-
bers of the ability to initiate 
cour es, invite lecturers, conf r 
decrees, and make faculty ap-
pointments. 

His resolution was ruled out 
of order at that me tlnc, in Iicht 
of the previous ruling to table 
discussion on such matters. How-

1 will 

be reintroduced at the general 
meeting olthe Recants tomorrow. 

Five hundred students will be 
alrowed to view the proceedings 
in the gym on a first-come -
first-served basis, with priority 
going to UCSO students. This 
figure was reached through a 
compromise with the Regents, 
who had considered holding their 
meetings off-campus after the 
Santa Cruz outbursts. 

For those students who are not 
allowed in the gym there will be 
activities outside and runners 
will report pro~ress from inside. 
l!: ldridge Cleaver and Georlte 
Murray, Black Panther leaders, 
will be in town and have said that 
they will come to UCSO only 11 
there is absolute assurance of no 
trouble.
