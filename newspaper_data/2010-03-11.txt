On Feb. 25, the University of 
California’s librarians’ union signed a 
new labor contract guaranteeing higher 
salaries, benefits and improved job secu-
rity for more than 400 UC librarians.

Despite a state fiscal crisis, and bud-
get cuts plaguing the campuses, the 
University of California Office of the 
President and the University Council-
American Federation of Teachers reached 
a tentative agreement on Dec. 19, 2009 
which ensures salary increases, severance 
packages and a larger budget for profes-
sional development activities. The agree-
ment was then approved by the UC-AFT 
Librarian Unit. 

Librarians will now receive a five-per-
cent salary increase each time they are pro-
moted. Promotions are subject to a peer 
review process every two to three years. 

The UCOP agreed to increase the 
systemwide training budget by 3 per-
cent — or a total of $8,217. At UCSD, 
the amount allocated to development 
— which allows librarians to attend con-
ferences and receive training to advance

The Department of Housing, 
Dining and Hospitality will vote on a 
proposal this week to increase manda-
tory dining dollars by $100 next year, 
despite evidence that most students 

living in the residence 
halls will be left with 
excess by the end of 
Spring Quarter.

Students living in 
the residence halls 
currently pay $2,795 
a year in dining dol-

lars, while students in the apartments 
pay $2,145. According to the 2009-10 
recommended budget — published in 
each dining hall by Housing, Dining 
and Hospitality services — by March 
4, students in residence halls should 
have $1,077 remaining and those in 
the apartments should have $824 left.

Instead, 74.1 percent of students 
living in the residence halls — who 
have $82 per week to spend — are 
above the targeted amount of meal 
points, while only 10.5 percent are 
below target. Twenty-three percent of 
students living in the apartments — 
who have $63 to spend per week — are 
above target, 37 percent are below.

for the On-Campus Housing Dining 
and Hospitality Committee Wafa

The three-week media freeze — ordered by A.S. 
President Utsav Gupta on Feb. 19 — was lifted at 
Wednesday’s A.S. council meeting, after the council 
voted 5-13-5 to fail a last-minute amendment that pro-

posed a government speech model. 
The model would have allowed the 
council to fund — through advertise-
ments — only the media organizations 
they deemed to uphold the UCSD 
Principles of Community. 

According to the A.S. Standing 
Rules, a funding freeze is automatically lifted by 
Wednesday of Week 10 if the council doesn’t pass 
legislation that counters that rule. By default, council 
returned to funding media organizations with the 
same system as before. 

Gupta froze all media funds after a racial slur was 
aired on an episode of Koala TV, preventing campus 

media publications from accessing their Winter and 
Spring Quarter funds. He then chartered a committee 
to discuss new media guidelines that prevent funding 
hate speech.

Committee members considered two main alterna-
tives: a government-speech model and an opt-out model, 
which would allow students to remove their student fee 
funding from certain publications. 

The committee failed to make an official recommen-
dation or submit any written legislation, with the excep-
tion of a Standing Rules amendment — submitted by Vice 
President of Finance and Resources Peter Benesch — to 
implement the government-speech model. 

Benesch’s model found support from students who 
called for the council to defund the Koala and UC 
Student Regent delegate Jesse Cheng. 

“We stand for this protocol because this issue is an 
issue of diversity and not really an issue of free speech 
and even less an issue of the Constitution,” Cheng said. 
“If it does come down to legality, it’s the Supreme Court’s 
responsibility to constitutionality — you don’t have to 
worry about that here.”

The amendment also created backlash among com-
mittee members who were not aware that Benesch

Speaking as someone who winces at 
the name Wes Anderson, I have to 
give it to him: His shit may be fucking 
kitsch and overrated, but “Fantastic 
Mr. Fox” wasn’t half bad.

If anything, Anderson’s stop-
motion, miniature marvel was 
unfairly eclipsed because of the cutesy 
iron curtain trailing “Up” (whose 
reviews were as bloated as its anima-
tion), or because it came packaged as 
a children’s movie. Whatever the rea-
son, “Fantastic Mr. Fox” didn’t get its 
due distinction this year. It managed 
to be endearing without begging for 

sentimen-
tal spare 
change 
and as 

charming as its dapper, tweed-tailored 
protagonist could hope to be. 

Building off Roald Dahl’s puck-
ish prose and pigeonholed band of 

burrowing creatures 
(wrapped in a thinly 
veiled class critique), the 
film manages to textur-

ize the book with 
handcrafted, pop-

up panache. 
And while 
Anderson’s 
typical 
strategy for 
communicat-
ing character 

depth usually 
relies on quirky 
mannerisms, 
this time 
around, it iron-
ically didn’t feel 
as childish.

A committee to create a student 
-run A.S. store will present its busi-
ness plan to the University Centers 
Advisory Board by Week 5 of Spring 
Quarter.

The A.S. committee hopes to open 
the store — which would sell UCSD 
merchandise, including Greek apparel 
and Sun God paraphernalia — in Price 
Center by Fall Quarter 2010.

The committee had originally 
hoped to complete and submit its pro-
posal to UCAB by the end of Fall 
Quarter 2009, but Vice President of 
Finance and Resources Peter Benesch 
said that the process has been slower 
than anticipated because the commit-
tee underestimated all the research on 
merchandise and demand necessary to 
the project.

“Where we are now is where we 
thought we would be last quarter,” 
Benesch said. “The idea of completely 
understanding all the factors that go 
into opening the store was infinite-
ly more complicated than originally 
expected. There were a lot of factors we 

needed to investigate, which we have 
done now.”

According to committee chair and 
Campuswide Senator Tobias Haglund, 
the committee members spent Winter 
Quarter discussing what merchandise 
to sell and how to advertise.

“This quarter we’ve kind of mapped 
out the business plan we want to pre-
pare,” Haglund said. “We’ve worked 
mainly on the structure of the store 
we want to create. A lot of that has 
just been me talking to people at other 
stores at other campuses.”    

To facilitate the process, the com-
mittee is speaking with a student 
consultant from the Rady School of 
Management.

“This quarter we’ve met with a 
consultant and we essentially have a 
consultant on the team to help us fin-
ish the business plan,” Haglund said.    

The committee is also in the pro-
cess of creating an A.S. Store Advisory 
Board, made up of six faculty members 
and two undergraduate students. The 
store’s student managers would update 
the board on the store’s progress to 
gain input on how the store could 
improve and expand.

“Right now we’re doing a recruit-
ment process, finding the people we 
think would be appropriate and ben-
eficial to that board,” Haglund said. 
“I’ve been sending out emails to as 
many people as possible, trying to col-
lect people who would be interested 
and good for that position. We’re hop-
ing to have the board filled by the end 
of finals week so they can see pieces 
of the business proposal as they are 
completed.”

Haglund hopes to submit the pro-
posal before the current A.S. Council 
completes its term, which is Week 
5 of next quarter. If the proposal is 
completed, submitted and approved by 
that time, the store could open by Fall 
Quarter 2010, according to Haglund.

“I would love to see it open up 
in fall next year,” Haglund said. “I’m 
definitely going to continue working 
with them to do anything I can to help 
them. If we get it approved by UCAB 
in the middle of spring, we have all the 
time to make sure all our I’s are dotted 
and our T’s are crossed.”

Haglund said, despite the stall, he 
remains optimistic about the project 
and plans to work persistently toward 

its completion.   
“I want to make sure [the proposal] 

is presented to UCAB before my term 
is up,” Haglund said. “That’s kind of 
my obligation to A.S., to myself, to my 
constituents — to finish that before my 
term is up.”

NEWSTHURSDAY, MARCH 11, 2010THE UCSD GUARDIAN 3 

By Regina Ip
Staff Writer

Is your Grandma feeling blue? 
Take a tip from a recent UCSD study 
and lend her your Wii for a round of 
tennis or two — the exercise will do 
her good.

In a study published in February, 
psychiatrists at the UCSD School 
of Medicine found evidence that 
video games that combine the thrill 
of competition with exercise — like 
Nintendo’s Wii Sports — lower symp-
toms of a mild form of depression 
common in older adults. 

These exergames can help seniors 
improve their moods by producing 
endorphins and encouraging them to 
exercise. 

Subsyndromal depression, which 
is more common than clinical depres-
sion in older adults, is associated with 
functional disabilities, increased medi-
cal costs and higher mortality. Physical 
activity can improve health and reduce 
depressive symptoms, but those with 
SSD may not enjoy physical activity as 
much, and are likely to stop exercising 
prematurely.

“The issue with older people has 
always been that they don’t sustain 
exercise,” psychiatry Ph.D candidate 
Ipsit V. Vahia said. “Our theory was 
that maybe if we use video games, 
then it’s a way of getting older people 
to get some exercise. It offers advan-
tages: they can do it in their house, it’s 
safer and it can also be more enter-
taining, so they’re likely to do it more 
often.”

Vahia worked with fellow co-

investigator Colin Depp, an assistant 
adjunct professor of psychiatry, in the 
study led by Dilip V. Jeste. Jeste is a 
professor of psychiatry and neurosci-
ences at the UCSD School of Medicine 
and director of the Sam and Rose 
Stein Institute for Research on Aging. 

In a preliminary study, the 
researchers collaborated with CalIT2 
— which gave guidance on how to 
choose the right physical activity levels 
to ensure safety — to figure out how 
to get older adults to stick with an 
exercise plan. 

The researchers thought exergames 
could allow SSD patients to get their 
recommended amount of physical 
activity without leaving their house. 
The researchers decided to use the 
commercially available Wii Sports so 
that they could reach a broader audi-
ence.

“They liked Wii Sports mainly 
because it was so easy to use, and they 
liked creating the Mii character for 
themselves — it made it more engag-
ing,” Vahia said.

The researchers then tested the 
effectiveness and safety of Wii 
games on 19 participants aged 
63 to 94. The seniors played 
one of the five Wii Sports 
games — bowling, boxing, 
tennis, golf and baseball — for 
35 minutes, three times a week 
for 12 weeks.

After playing the game, the 
participants rated their expe-
riences with the Wii with 
high satisfaction. From 
these self-reported scales 
on mood, cognition and 
functioning, the research-
ers found that more than 
a third of the participant’s 
reported a decrease in 
depression symptoms by 
50 percent or more.

Specifically, they 

found that there was a large improve-
ment in depressive symptoms, mental 
health-related quality of life and cog-
nitive performance.

“It is our hope that we can demon-
strate exergames as a safe and effective 
way of improving physical activity in 
older adults,” Vahia said.

The study also concluded that 
older adults can play exergames with-
out injury if they are properly trained.

The researchers are now planning 
to do a more detailed study, where 
they will be looking at the physi-
ological and psychological effects of 
exergames. They will also be testing 
exergames on a larger pool of partici-
pants, who will be chosen at random 
and compared with a control group.

They will also explore the uses of 
exergames in different demographics.

A couple hundred students literally swarmed the fourth floor of Price Center East 
yesterday, a bigger crowd than most 
that have attended A.S. meetings in 
recent years. The majority of stu-
dents were there 
to persuade 
councilmem-
bers into voting 
one way or the 
other on how to 
fund A.S. media 
organizations — 
a debate that began after President 
Utsav Gupta froze their funds three 
weeks ago.  

Yesterday’s public input session 
started promptly at 6 p.m., and 
ended 90 minutes later — a much 
longer timeslot than the typical 
20-minute time slot. 

Various members from A.S.-
funded media organizations and 
the Student Affirmative Action 
Committee (SAAC) community 
spent that hour and a half heatedly 
voicing their opinions for or against 
funding the Koala. 

“If you guys want to pass an 
amendment where you can censor 
speech, I urge you that it will end in 
an ugly legal battle,” Koala associate 
editor Wes Field said. “We just want 
to sip our beers and make fun of 
whoever the hell we want.” 

Jesse Cheng, the UC Student 
Regent delegate from UC Irvine, 
stood his ground to public dissent. 

“Students will one day hear about 
this and decide never to come to this 
campus,” Cheng said. “The goal here 
is for students to leave educated and 
with understanding for fellow citi-
zens. Student publications are only 
an example of the issue, not the real 
issue itself.”  

Chris Cruz, AVP of Student 
Advocacy and chair of the Media 

Review funding board, presented the 
committee’s three potential models 
with which to fund media orgs. 

While explaining the first option 
— which allowed A.S. to choose 
which media organizations to fund 

based on UCSD 
Principles of 
Community — VP 
of Finance and 
Resources Peter 
Benesch said the 
heart of democ-
racy is the ability 

to choose whose voice is heard over 
others. 

Because the committee drafted no 
official legislation, there wasn’t must to 
discuss, but the debate continued.

After a long, noisy discourse, 
Speaker James Lintern made the 
final decision to move the issue to 
New Business.  

Councilmembers voted 14-9-1 
to reinstate media funding. This 
was irrelevant, as the media funding 
freeze would have been unfrozen 
at the end of the council meeting 
anyway. Still, the council wanted to 
make its point.

Then, the council shot down 
Benesch’s “Option 1: Government 
Speech” legislation, which would put 
media funding entirely under the 
control of the VP of Finance. Many 
councilmembers objected strongly 
to his idea of putting the power in, 
essentially, one person’s hands. The 
motion failed. 

On a completely different note, 
Campuswide Senator Wafa Ben 
Hassine urged others to attend the 
Housing, Dining and Hospitality 
public forum today, to oppose the 
$100 increase in student dining dol-
lars for the next academic year. 

Gupta ended the meeting by 
congratulating everyone on working 
hard and “not tearing apart.”

Props to Washington DC Mayor Adrian M. Fenty for signing a bill 
that went into effect yesterday, joining the DC district with the ﬁve 
other states that have legalized same-sex marriage.

For all you fortunate souls who spent last night somewhere other than the fourth floor of 
Price Center East: It was mayhem.

Not mayhem by the magnified 
standards we usually put on A.S. 
Council affairs, all tangled up in 
bureaucratic floss over something as 
inconsequential as a sheet of paper 
proclaiming either “we condemn” 
or “we condone.” No, we’re talking 
real-live mayhem: 200 angry students 
packed into every corner of the board-
room, split into two viciously opinion-
ated camps, ready to fight to the death 
over their right to exist equally/com-
fortably on this campus. 

Student-media orgs wanted their 
money back, with no threat of content 
regulation. Minority students and sup-
porters did not want their money going 
toward publications that degraded and 
alienated them on campus. Affirmative 
action somehow became a hot topic, 
heaped onto a pile of irrelevant court 
cases and personal attacks. At one 
point, it seemed members of the crowd 
were ready to make it physical.

But the most frightening part of the 
whole mess was the seated U-shape 
of ex-ASB hotheads, invested with 
jurisdiction over $3 million in student 
fees and a penchant to rock the com-
ing A.S. elections (or head a gallant 
stampede into a gray area of law before 
even stepping foot into law school). 
All while Associate Vice President of 
Student Life Gary Ratcliff stood a few 
feet away, peacefully watching students 
bite off each others’ heads — essentially 
doing administrators’ dirty work for 
them.

And just when we thought things 
were going to quiet down. According 
to the A.S. Standing Rules, the freeze 
could only have lasted until yesterday 
night. Offensive humor newspaper the 
Koala — whose racial remarks were 
the reason A.S. President Utsav Gupta 
froze funds in the first place — had 
already released an issue on borrowed 
cash, and satirical rag the MQ put one 
out using an alternate Muir College 
bank account (unfortunately, no one 
was laughing at the latter).

Plus, a committee Gupta formed 

three weeks ago — to determine 
whether new funding guidelines were 
necessary — was getting along just 
swimmingly.

Which now looks suspiciously like 
a scheme, as everyone appointed to 
the committee had a similar stance: 
All were generally unwilling to rec-
ommend any funding model with 
content bias. So committee  mem-
bers — including Koala Editor in 
Chief Kris Gregorian and very vocal 
Sixth College Senator John Condello, 
a presidential candidate for spring 
— let their guard down, thinking 
they had this one in the bag. Gupta 
fooled them momentarily, moping 
around like a defeated servant of the 
people. He and partner-in-crime Vice 
President of Finance and Resources 
Peter Benesch stood by dopely while 
the rest of the committee trumpeted 
no-bars content-neutral funding, then 
wasted a week making friends and 
out-articulating each other on exactly 
the same points. 

-,1<7:1)4;

You’d think that — after an enormous systemwide student-fee increase and pleas 
for money to save the Loft and our 
transportation department — the last 
on-campus business to ask for more 
money would be the only one that 
turns a profit.

However, in a discrete effort to 
pad their lucrative business, Housing, 
Dining and Hospitality now has the 
audacity to ask for a $100 meal-point 
increase, potentially affecting over 
7,000 on-campus residents. It’s been 
deliberately kept under wraps, along 
with the fact that, if passed, it would 
represent the fifth consecutive year 
meal points have been upped. 

Four years ago, someone living in 
a res. hall would pay $1,800 per year 
for meal points. Since then, that sum 
has increased to $2,795 — $1,000 
more in prepaid cash that can only 
be used to purchase mediocre Cafe V 
sushi, $10 boxes of strawberries and 
overpriced toasters. Not exactly a diet 
our mothers would approve of. 

Nevermind the fact that most 
students don’t know what to do with 
the already enormous heap of points 
they’re allotted. According to data 
from a HDH survey this year, of 3,517 
residents, 372 have fewer meal points 
than they need, 515 have just enough 
and a whopping 2,630 students — 
nearly 75 percent — have too many. 

Survey results for apartment dwell-
ers are equally telling. Of the 4,345 
students in the apartments required to 
purchase a $2,145 dining plan, 1,007 
students had too many points, while 
1,697 had just enough.

And despite all that extra money, 
dining-hall hours have already been 
reduced — a tragic cut for overcaf-
feinated students studying into the 
wee hours of the night — and there’s 
hardly a healthy option in sight, aside 
from a pitiful selection of produce 

that costs twice as much as it would 
at Ralphs.

Not to mention, a massive amount 
of prepaid dollars encourages students 
to spend irresponsibly. If we don’t all 
blow our dining dollars on Natural 
juices now, we’ll just be rushing to 
Roger’s Place the last week of Spring 
Quarter to throw whatever’s left into a 
toaster oven or an inflatable couch. 

Of course, even though students 
are already overpaying for mediocre, 
unhealthy food and constantly shrink-
ing choices, dining officials aren’t 
hesitating to turn to the students for 
a little extra cash. Student representa-
tive for the On-Campus Housing and 
Dining Committee Wafa Ben Hassine 
cited a 4-percent union-mandated 
salary increase as the reason for this 
$100 hike, but just because workers 
serve us in the dining hall, doesn’t 
mean it’s our job to foot the bill every 
time their agreements grant them 
more pay. 

The one beacon of hope in the face 
of HDH’s shady plan is that the com-
mittee voting on the proposal tomor-
row is mostly student-run. However, 
the students are being threatened with 
closures and a reduction in hours, 
bringing us to a fundamental issue 
that’s come up one too many times 
this year: When the university needs 
funding, it turns to student fees as an 
easy out, rather than as a last resort. 

Before sticking incoming freshmen 
with another mandatory fee, HDH 
should go back to the drawing board 
and investigate its options. We don’t 
feel the department has gone to great 
enough lengths to determine student 
consensus on the issue — and clearly, 
if nearly three-quarters of res.-hall 
inhabitants aren’t even using up their 
current meal plans, there’s not much 
need for an increased midnight-bur-
rito-run allowance. Here’s yet another 
instance of an administrative proposal 
that would drastically impact the stu-

dent body, flying way under the radar 
— one which, without demonstrated 
need, no amount of administrative 
excuse-making can justify.

With good reason, people in Washington are a little weirded out by Patrick 
Kennedy at the moment. The Rhode 
Island congressman kind of went off 
the handle yesterday. And by kind of, 
I mean a lot. 

In a fit of rage, Kennedy berated 
the press for failing to cover an 
important House discussion on the 
U.S. war in Afghanistan. He shouted 
until his face turned red, waved his 

arms like a wild man and effectively 
called the media a bunch of scandal-
mongering assclowns. We haven’t 
seen that kind of behavior on the 
House floor since, well, probably last 
week or something.

But while it’s not uncommon 
to witness politicians behaving 
like angry children in front of the 
CSPAN cameras, Kennedy’s outburst 
carries with it a particular weight. 
Though he expressed his anger in 
a truly unfortunate manner, his 
sentiment is undeniably justified. 
His frustration is the same kind we 
all begin to feel after the same tired 
gossip of Tiger Wood’s mistress col-
lection makes the news for weeks 
on end, the sort of rage that brews 
when relentless discussion of shock 
and scandal eclipses issues of real 
national concern. 

For the last several days, a sig-
nificant portion of the media has 
been fixated on the alleged extra-
marital perversions of flash-in-the-
pan New York congressman Eric 
Massa. Massa — who is the spitting 
image of Joe Pesci in “Home Alone 
2” after his hair got set on fire — has 
been chugging steadily along on the 
denial train since he was pinned 
with accusations of inappropriate 
sexual conduct with a male staffer 
last week. With evidence mounting 
against him, Massa began swing-
ing wildly. After resigning his post, 
he claimed to have been repeatedly 
harassed in a Congressional shower 
by White House Chief of Staff 
Rahm Emanuel. He accused House 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House 
Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of fuel-
ing rumors of his misconduct in a 
plot to force him out of Congress 
and eliminate his opposition to the 
health care reform bill. He even 
went on Glenn Beck. 

The story is bizarre, enticing and 
scandalous as hell —  exactly the 
kind of thing for which we media 
hounds tend to go batshit crazy. 
Stories like that drive up readership, 
boost ratings and rake in the dough. 
Scandal is America’s lifeblood — a 
controlled addiction fed steadily by 
periodic bouts of sex-driven political 
idiocy and blurry photos of exotic 
vacations with exotic mistresses and 
exotic intrigue. 

After a while, however, you start 
to realize that batshit stinks. While 
Massa — like Patterson, Edwards, 
Blagojevich and every other washed-
up politician before them —  fum-
bles his way through his sex-tinged 
15 minutes of weirdo fame, impor-
tant things go unnoticed. Important 
things like automobile safety hear-
ings, corporate earmark restrictions

OPINION� MONDAY, MARCH 11, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

Gupta and Benesch were the odd 
ones out. They advocated an unpopu-
lar “government speech model” that 
would allow the council to fund only 
publications that aligned with its prin-
ciples. Gupta assured the committee 
it shouldn’t bother with PowerPoints, 
and would only have to present a casu-
al recommendation to the council.

The committee didn’t even 
bother to take an official vote on its 
stance, too busy waxing starstruck 
by Gregorian and drooling over the 
Bill of Rights. Condello literally set 
his feet up on the table during their 
final get-together (really more a wine 
garden than a meeting). So imag-
ine the cool kids’ surprise when, at 
last night’s official media-funding 
presentation, Benesch whipped out 
the PowerPointed legislation for a 
government speech model — hoping 
to charm the council with nicely pack-
aged research he had kept under wraps 
from the estranged committee.

In such a chaotic environment, 
with so many emotional students beg-
ging for action, there was the danger 

that councilmembers would join 
Gupta and Benesch under the pres-
sure. But Benesch’s  model was obvi-
ously terrible: Basically, every single 
newspaper would exist within the 
overly sensitive ideals of A.S.. Every 
newspaper would be an A.S. news-
paper. Fortunately, that red flag flew 
above the mayhem, and the ‘Yes’ vote 
didn’t wildfire off the duo’s arson.

But something else happened amid 
all the political plotting: The original 
problem was brushed aside. Sure, it was 
ridiculous for Gupta to at first suggest 
that there be seven Student Affirmative 
Action Committee representatives on 
the media-funding committee, but 
he swung to the opposite end of the 
spectrum, and discussion never really 
surpassed the First Amendment and 
Gregorian’s theories on our “post-
racist” society. Campuswide Senator 
Wafa Ben Hassine, one of the only 
voices that could have balanced out 
the committee, didn’t even show up for 
meetings — no doubt for fear of bad 
publicity for her presidential campaign. 

Gregorian is patting himself on 
the back for getting everyone to rise 

from the apathy and give a crap — but 
Gupta, in the role of evil dictator, is to 
be equally credited. Sadly, the debate 
is largely lacking an articulate voice 
against the Koala — the other side is 
blinded by hurt, and it’s unfortunately 
an argumentative disadvantage. The 
Koala is knowingly beating the back-
bone of a marginalized few within 
a hostile environment, who find it 
hard to be numb to racist stereotypes 
because it’s still the majority laughing 
at the minority — us versus them. The 
only thing we can hope is that some 
particularly articulate member of the 
opposing party has the passion and 
initiative to upstart an opposing news-
paper, under new streamlined rules. 

And that is, in the end, what the 
committee has proposed: easier access 
to free press. More flexible deadlines, 
applications, access. Indeed, what a 
beautiful day that will be. We’d also like 
to see some anarchists with the balls 
to withdraw their A.S. fees completely, 
as a speaker during public input sug-
gested. And that brings us to the best 
part, without a doubt: We’re all talking. 
Thanks, Pupta. We love you.

Dear Editor,
The Coalition to Defend 

Affirmative Action, Integration, 
and Immigrant Rights and Fight for 
Equality By Any Means Necessary  
congratulates the Black Student 
Union and all of the black, Latino, 
American Indian and other students 
who have waged the brave and inspir-
ing struggle against overt racism and 
hostility at UCSD. We know from 
our own experience that each student 
had to reach deep inside to overcome 
the fears and threats and to summon 
the courage needed to stand up for 
minority students’ rights. 

Because you fought, Ward 
Connerly has now declared that he 
will be “reviewing” the settlement that 
you have reached with the admin-
istration. As always, Connerly says 
nothing about the nooses, the hoods 
or the climate of racism — his only 
concern is to end the slightest step 
toward restoring fairness, equality and 
affirmative action.

If Ward Connerly threatens one 
syllable of the agreement you reached 
with UCSD, we would be proud to 
provide whatever legal and political 
support you need to defeat him.

Connerly’s Proposition 209 
remains the crucial obstacle to our 
shared fight to stop the re-segregation 
of the University of California, to 
increase minority student enrollment 
and to restore the UC system’s histori-
cal commitment to educate the next 
generation of leaders for California 
and the nation. In a state that is now 
a majority-minority state, it is sim-
ply unacceptable to have only a tiny 
number of black and Latino students 
attending the UC campuses. 

At the UC Regents meeting that 
will be held in San Francisco from 
March 23 to 25, we and other orga-
nizations will be demanding that 
the regents put their own words into 
action. We demand that the regents 
take the following steps:

1) Use all lawful means to increase 
underrepresented minority enroll-
ment immediately,

2) Pass the Bernal-Block motion to 
provide UC institutional financial aid 
to undocumented AB 540 students.

3) Follow California Attorney 
General Jerry Brown’s lead by stating 
as their position in the federal court 
that Proposition 209 is unconstitu-
tional and discriminatory, stand on 
their own 2001 unanimous resolu-
tion opposing the ban on affirmative 
action and tell the plain truth that 
after experimenting with all conceiv-
able admissions policies, Prop. 209 
still creates an unfathomable barrier to 
the UC system’s ability to admit thou-
sands of fully qualified black, Latino 
and American Indian students.

Taking these simple measures 
would provide a systemwide body 
blow to the racists and bigots who are 
trying to drive us off our own 
campuses. Getting the UC system’s 
support for overturning Prop. 209 
and creating a UC Dream Scholarship 
would provide our new student move-
ment with huge victories in our strug-

gle to defend public education.
We can win if all those who want 

to fight for equality unite. Join with 
us in the lawsuit against Proposition 
209 and in demanding action by the 
regents.

Dear Editor,
Embedded in your March 4 article, 

“KKK Hood Hung on Dr. Seuss 
Statue,” was a poll regarding racism 
on campus. I feel your findings in the 
poll are an inaccurate representation 
of the actual feeling on campus.

The first reason as to why this poll 
sucks is the question it asks. When 
you ask, “Do you think racism is a 
problem on campus?” it infers that 
there is racism on this campus, and 
thus is a deliberate question that leads 
people to think a certain way. A much 
fairer question would ask whether or 
not people tend to feel that there is 
racism on campus.

The next problem with your poll is 
its location. It is a poll put out in the 
Guardian. Your paper does not have 
a large readership, let alone a whole 
bunch of people who actually want 
to answer a poll question. Placing 
this question in your newspaper 
(or advertising it on your Web site) 
means that you are polling a group of 
people that regularly read your paper 
and probably have stronger opinions 
(either way) about the campus climate 
than does the student body in gen-
eral. Basically, your sample was not 
randomized and happened to find the 
people who feel a certain way.

I hope that this is a graph with a 
95-percent confidence interval, but I 
cannot be sure. If this is a 95-percent 
confidence interval, you have a range 
of about 30.5 percent to about 41.5 
percent. This means that your number 
could be significantly lower than you 
project.

So in all reality, you are 95 percent 
certain that between 30.5 percent and 
41.5 percent of the sample popula-
tion think that racism is a problem on 
campus. As stated before, your ques-
tion is not neutral, and your sample 
population isn’t representative of the 
student body.

Lastly, at the end of your article, 
you said, “the hood is the latest 
incident in a two-week rise in hate 
speech throughout the UC system.” 
You refer to something written on a 
wall at UC Santa Cruz and then refer 
to something else about the vandal-
izing of the UC Davis LGBT Resource 
Center. Somehow, you don’t report 
the carving of a swastika into a Jewish 
student’s door that took place at UC 
Davis around the same time as the 
noose incident at UCSD. Next time, 
don’t leave that part out — you might 
just convince even more people that 
the Guardian embodies certain biases.

and filibuster reform proposals. 
Wait, those sound super boring. Oh, 
OK, I get it now. 

But that doesn’t mean it’s OK. 
Kennedy was dead-on. The media 
has its priorities in all the wrong 
places. Driven largely by the need 
to turn some sort of profit, news 
outlets place an alarming premium 
on the type of shock-and-awe crap 
that keeps us coming back for more. 
Is Massa really the perv his detrac-
tors are claiming him to be? How 
often did that California legislator 
frequent his favorite gay bars while 
consistently voting against gay 
rights? How many different types of 
facial hair has New York Gov. David 

Patterson sported in the last three 
years? Could I too pull off a mus-
tache like that? 

At the same time, however, the 
media has a deep and vastly impor-
tant responsibility to the public. 
We’re here to provide people with 
information that makes them better 
citizens, better people, better voters. 
A sex scandal is always going to be 
more interesting than a lengthy dis-
cussion on the Senate’s budget rec-
onciliation procedures — but that’s 
just a cop out. It’s too easy. It’s too 
fleeting. It doesn’t mean anything in 
the long run. 

Heed Kennedy’s words. We’d all 
be better off with a little less scandal 
and a lot more news.

In the fight against intestinal 
roundworms — a disease that affects 
over a third of the world’s population 
and kills 60,000 people a year —  sci-
entists at UCSD have discovered a 
naturally occurring treatment for 
intestinal roundworms that is three 
times more effective than the best of 
existing drugs.

According to Raffi Aroian of the 
UCSD Division of Biological Sciences, 
who led the study, a bacterium called 
Bacillus thuringiensis — or “Bt” — is 
three times as effective as tribendimi-
dine, the leading chemical drug used 
to treat intestinal roundworms. Bt is 
naturally occurring in various types 
of caterpillars and used in a popular 
insecticide.

When an insect comes into con-
tact with crops that have been sprayed 
with the insecticide, Bt forms crystal 
proteins inside the insect’s gut that 
attack the animal’s cellular lining, 
causing gut paralysis and a quick 
death. In roundworms, the crystal 
protein Cry5B — taken from Bt — 
interacts with invertebrate-specific 
membrane molecules in the round-
worm’s intestine, eventually leading to 
destruction of the worm’s intestine.

Though Bt is toxic to insects, it is 
harmless to mammals because they 
lack the enzymes to make the destruc-
tive molecules, leading Aroian and 
his team, consisting of postdoctoral 
employee Yan Hu and graduate stu-
dent Sophia Georghiou, to believe it 
can cure intestinal roundworms and 

other internal parasites. 
“We took mice infected with intes-

tinal parasites and basically mimicked 
the disease,” Aroian said. “We gave 
them this natural pathogen of round-
worms called Bt… [which is] excellent 
at eliminating insects and not verte-
brates. The logic of the experiment 
is this: if we have a bacterium that 
we know is harmless to vertebrates, 
instead of using it to kill insects living 
in plants, we said, ‘Why don’t we feed 
Bt to these mice infected with intesti-
nal roundworms?’”

The bacterium proved very effec-
tive, curing all 17 mice without any 
side effects. However, in order to 
prove that this find was truly signifi-
cant — and that Bt could replicate the 
effects of leading drugs for intestinal 
parasites — Aroian had to compare 
it with tribendimidine, the most 
effective drug used to treat intestinal 
roundworms. Tribendimidine is still 
being tested and is not yet available on 
the market.

“We gave the infected mice this 
protein, saw the effectiveness and we 
compared it in a head-to-head study 
to a chemical drug still in clinical 
trials that is known to be the best 
combatant against intestinal parasites, 
finding that Bt was about three times 
better,” Aroian said.

According to the scientific jour-
nal Maternal & Child Nutrition, 
intestinal parasites like round-
worms, pinworms and whipworms 
affect over 2 billion people world-
wide. Though ascariasis — an 
infection of the parasitic round-
worm — exists in the United 
States, it is most common in coun-
tries with poor sanitation and lack 
of water supplies. 

These parasites can live within 
a human’s intestines for some time 
before that person displays symp-
toms, and travel through the body, 

causing slow damage in the abdomen 
and pelvis, as well as inflammation, 
toxicity and pneumonia. Heavy and 
prolonged infestations in children 
have been known to cause nutritional 
deficiency, growth stunting and some 
mental retardation.

Aroian said he hopes the discovery 
will help reduce the number of people 
suffering from roundworms.

“This should be a very cheap drug 
to make,” Aroian said. “This is really 
aimed at helping some of the poorest 
people in the world.” 

According to the George Institute 
of International Health report, about 
$720,000 was spent in 2008 to develop 
new drugs specifically for these 
parasites. With a comparable sum of 
funding, clinical trials for a Bt-based 
roundworm drug could begin soon, 
Aroian said.

sory committee have offered sev-
eral explanations for students being 
behind in their spending.

“A lot of [committee members] 
are arguing for it because of one 
reason or another, like ‘Oh, well, 
people in the res halls don’t spend 
as much as they should because 
they don’t know how to spend their 
money,’ or ‘They don’t know how to 
go about with a dining plan,’” Ben 
Hassine said.

A 12-person committee, com-
prised mostly of students, will 
vote on the proposal this Friday. 
Student representatives from each 
of the six colleges will join A.S. 
representatives — including  Ben 
Hassine — and the Inter-Collegiate 
Resident’s Association. The com-
mittee also includes Director of 
Housing, Dining and Hospitality 
Mark Cunningham and Director of 
Financial Aid Ann Klein.

According to Ben Hassine, 
Cunningham said additional rev-
enue from an increase in dining 
dollars is necessary due to union-
mandated wage increases and the 
rising cost of things like food and 
utilities. Also, environmentally con-
scious choices — like cage-free eggs 
and fair trade coffee — rack up addi-
tional costs.

“They need to fill a certain gap, 
because next year — you know how 
everything constantly increases, 
like the food, the raw food, utilities, 
electricity, water, everything — we 
need to fill in that gap somehow, 
and we can’t cut services, ‘cause 
those are our workers, custodians 
and such,” Michael Lam, the ICRA 
Representative for the Committee, 
said. “But nobody wants [to close 
down OVT for a year], and every-
body wants to keep our services. So 
the only way anyone could think of 
to cover that gap was to increase the 
dining dollars, to have people pay 

more.”
Lam also cited concern for lower-

income students as his reason for 
supporting the increase.

“I don’t want to cut dining 
halls because there are a lot of stu-
dent workers, and they depend on 
those,” Lam said. “The Director of 
Financial Aid Ann Klein said that 
financial aid would be able to cover 
[the $100] increase, but that’s only 
for financial aid students. So that’s 
why everyone is saying that we need 
this increase, there is no other way 
to fill the gap.”

Since the 2007-08 school year, 
dining dollars for students in the 
residence halls has increased from 
$1,800 to $2,795 in 2010-11.

Marshall College senior Derek 
Lao said that having fewer meal 
points as a freshman helped him 
learn to pace himself when it came 
to spending money.

“Freshman year I ran out, I had 
to reload about $200,” Lao said. 
“[Mandatory meal points are] kind 
of forcing freshmen to spend their 
money, instead of teaching them 
how to budget their own money and 
be responsible. You have to real-
ize that you can’t always get Ben & 
Jerry’s for every meal.”

Muir College freshman Yonatan 
Rotman said he has too many meal 
points and is worried about having 
leftover dining dollars at the end of 
the year.

“Personally, I have more dining 
dollars than I need,” Rotman said. 
“I don’t think more are necessary. If 
someone were to run out, they can 
buy more themselves, so there’s no 
reason to force all students to buy 
$100 more.”

Cunningham could not be 
reached for comment.

▶ DINING, from page 1



NEWSTHURSDAY, MARCH 11, 2010THE UCSD GUARDIAN 7 

had prepared a piece of legislation to present. 
Members felt that he had been working on the 
amendment behind their backs. 

Gupta explained that this was not the case. 
“There was never an agreement to not have 

legislation or not use PowerPoint, as some peo-
ple have said,” Gupta said. “There was no shady 
business or working behind people’s backs. All 
of these are scare tactics used by the majority to 
attempt to silence the minority. These ideas of a 
possible evil A.S., threats of litigation, or censor-
ship — they’re unfair arguments, scare tactics 
for people who want to undercut the legislation.”

He added that concerns that the government-
speech model could be abused were unfounded.

“The A.S. Council is moderate and would 
continue to substantially fund media organi-
zations,” he said. 

Warren Senator Alyssa Wing, who voted 
in favor of the proposed legislation, said recent 
racially motivated events on campus created a 
need for the council to change the system. 

“We’ve really been urged to do something 
to uphold the Principles of Community,” 
Wing said. 

According to Benesch, various Supreme 
Court cases supported the legality of the gov-
ernment-speech model. 

“Essentially, this idea supposes that we will 
close the open forum where everyone can come 
and ask for money and we have to distribute 
in a viewpoint-neutral manner, and move to 
a model where the A.S. will have to provide a  
large amount of funding through advertising 
initiatives,” Benesch said. 

Koala Editor in Chief Kris Gregorian said he 
opposes the government-speech model because 
it forces publications to abide by the Principles 
of Community or lose funding.

Although Wednesday’s final decision 
returned the funding model to its original sys-
tem, the committee also discussed implement-
ing an opt-out model. This model would allow 
students to request for the portion of their 
student fees that go toward certain publica-
tions to be removed on moral grounds. With 
the current system, students who request that 
their money be removed are reimbursed from 
the A.S. General Fund instead of their chosen 
organization.

According to Benesch, UCSD legal counsel 
Dan Park said the opt-out model was illegal 
because it allowed students to fiscally discrimi-
nate based on content. 

Transfer Senator and committee member 
Adam Powers said he favors the opt-out model, 
since it would have allowed students to vote with 
their dollars. 

“We are empowering students to make a 
decision with how the campus is run,” he said. 

The committee also discussed improving the 
original process by allowing print media orgs to 
request funding on a rolling basis. 

Associate Vice President of Student 
Organizations Andrew Ang said he prefers 
adding a line item that creates an emergency 
fund from which media orgs could withdraw. 

Park declined to comment. 
According to David Blair-Loy, director of 

American Civil Liberties Union’s San Diego 
branch, both the government-speech and opt-
out models violate the First Amendment since 
they discriminate against the press as a form 
of speech. 

“There are numerous student orgs that 
engage in all forms of protected speech that 
aren’t print,” Blair-Loy said. “A.S. has funded 
many forms of controversial speech, and they 
can’t treat student press differently from the 
way they treat other student orgs. The First 
Amendment doesn’t just protect freedom of 
speech, it protects freedom of the press.”

He said that these two proposed systems 
violate Section 61.13 of the UC Regents policy, 
which states that student government must pro-
vide funding on a viewpoint-neutral basis.  

“I never say preliminarily that I will sue 
before I do, but if A.S. adopts either of these 
options, their chance of being litigated will 
increase exponentially,” Blair-Loy said. 

Gupta said he hoped the council would not 
bow under threats of litigation. He said although 
council has no definite plans to change media 
guidelines, outside pressure to fight against 
funding hate speech will only increase, espe-
cially in light of the UC Board of Regents work-
ing to apply a form of the government-speech 
model systemwide.

their professional knowledge — will increase 
from $24,557 to $25,298.

The contract also gives librarians a new sever-
ance option. If faced with layoffs, librarians can 
choose to give up “recall rights” — the ability to 
return to a job in their field of work, if one opens 
up — in favor of a time-limited severance package. 

This system was created because, in big-
ger libraries, librarians faced with lay-offs can 
request that librarians with less seniority be fired 
first. But in smaller libraries that employ only 
four to five librarians, this is not an option.

The severance pay option only 
applies to six of the 10 UC campus-
es — excluding UC Santa Barbara, 
UC Santa Cruz, UC Merced and 
UCSD.

It was also agreed that, should 
the University of California enact 
future systemwide salary increas-
es, librarians will get the same 
percentage increases as other spe-
cialized personnel.

According to UCOP Senior 
Negotiator Peter Chester, the new 
contract acknowledges the work 
of UC librarians while recogniz-
ing the current financial circum-
stances. 

“Given the current economic 
situation, I believe we’ve reached a 
very good agreement,” Chester said. 

However, according to Chief Negotiator for 
the UC-AFT Librarian Unit Mike Rotkin, the 
agreement does not meet the librarians’ needs. 
He said that after two years of negotiations, the 
union was forced to settle. 

“After negotiating for university lecturers for 
25 years and now for librarians, I’ve realized that 
the UC administration cannot be approached 
with rationale at the bargaining table,” Rotkin 
said. “[It is] not a rational institution.” 

Rotkin said the new contract does not address 
the disparity between UC librarians’ salaries and 
those at the California State University system, 
who are paid an average of 20 percent more. 

According to the UCOP’s Web site, assistant 
librarians are paid anywhere from $57,600 to 
$105,800 annually. Rotkin claims the average 
starting salary for assistant librarians is $46,164, 

compared to $55,944 at CSUs. After six years, 
the gap increases — UC assistant librarians make 
$49,409, compared to $64,320 at CSUs. The 
discrepancy between salaries a primary reasons 
negotiations began two years ago. 

Chester said the salary gap can be attributed 
to different labor contracts and job circumstanc-
es. He said CSU librarians do maintenance work, 
such as circulation, shelving and recordkeeping, 
while UC librarians often work with professors 
on their research.

“CSU librarians have a very different line of 
work from UC librarians,” Chester said. “Their 

jobs are not a valid comparison. CSU 
librarians have more leverage, as they 
are in the same bargaining unit as CSU 
faculty and staff.”

The UC-AFT and the UCOP ini-
tially met to draw up a new labor contract 
in 2007, before state funding for public 
higher education was cut by over $2.2 
billion. In the wake of $115 million in 
cuts to the UC system last spring and 
a $60 million cut last fall, the UC-AFT 
Librarian Bargaining Committee decided 
the best solution was to postpone further 
negotiations until May 11, 2011, where 
they will once again open discussion 
about the salary gap. 

The cuts have made it difficult to pro-
vide salary increases and job security for 
the librarians’ union, Chester said. 

Rotkin, however, said that the UC 
system can refuse a more comprehensive con-
tract only because the current contract prevents 
UC-AFT from striking.

“It is just the general perception that the UCs 
don’t have money,” Rotkin said. “We believe that 
the UCs have money. Unless we’re threaten-
ing them with damaging consequences such as 
strikes, we have no real bargaining power.”

Rotkin said if the UCOP does not close the 
salary gap, the librarians are likely to strike.

“Our current contracts [do] not allow for the 
withholding of labor,” Rotkin said. “[But] should 
the parties come to [an] impasse in the reopener 
bargaining over salary for 2011-12, the librarians 
are free to strike.”

I ’ve always felt like the odd one out at UCSD. The moment I walked into my Tioga freshman triple, I 
felt isolated — I realized I was going 
to be the token white kid for an entire 
year, and I’d never experienced such 
culture and identity shock. 

Whenever I’d peek into my suit-
emates’ rooms on a Friday and ask 
if they wanted to see a show at the 
Che Cafe or go on a beach adventure, 
they’d politely decline and return to 
Guitar Hero or studying chemical 
compounds. If it weren’t for fellow 
Guardian columnist and science 
misfit Philip Rhie, who accompanied 

me on weekend skate trips and philo-
sophical talks, I wouldn’t have had 
any close friends then. It took ‘til Fall 
Quarter of my second year to finally 
muster enough initiative to apply to 
be a Guardian writer and awaken 
from my deep funk. This choice 
marked my start of a new lifestyle on 
this fickle campus.

I have felt unbelievable lows here, 
even though our school is located in 
a gorgeous beach town with universe-
rivaling weather. Yes, the other reason 
I feel so left out is because you can 
separate UCSD kids into two basic 
categories: those who care and those 
who don’t. And the latter is an over-

INTERVIEW

By Chris Kokiousis
Senior Staff Writer

The Guardian: Could you talk 
a little bit about Auckland’s 
current music scene? Are there 
a lot of other bands from the 
city playing a similar style of 
music as you? What’s going on 
with current music trends in 
Auckland and New Zealand on 
a larger scale?
Ryan McPhun: I don’t think 
we fit into any kind of scene 
in Auckland. I’m not sure 
what the trends are here, or if 
there are any. The music scene 
is small enough, so it never 
seems like there [are] any kind 
of trends or scenes or what-
ever. Everyone’s just doing [his 

or her] own thing. Audiences 
are limited, so there’s no real 
pressure to impress anyone.
G: What contemporary 
American bands have inspired 
you the most this past year, 
and why?
RM: Well, I’ve been really into 
a lot of the bands on the ZZK 
label (that’s South American, 
Argentinean-based). You were 
wanting me to say Animal 
Collective, right? I definitely 
like their music, but I didn’t 
really connect with their latest 
album as much as I had their 
previous work. It was mostly 
commercial pop that provided 
the main impetus for a lot of 
the songs, from North America 
and otherwise. There’s a 

touchstone for each track that 
probably only makes sense to 
me. For example, “Haunted 
House” was my answer to 
“Single Ladies.” “Two Humans” 
was me trying to sound like 
Fleetwood Mac, especially stuff 
from the album Tango in the 
Night, et cetera.
G: What’s your favorite Kiwi 
slang, and how would you 
best translate it to American 
English? Do you guys ever 
incorporate distinctly Kiwi 
culture into your songwriting? 
If so, what’s an example of that 
on the new LP?
RM: Ha! I don’t think there’s 
any Kiwi slang on the album. 
I’d have to go through the lyr-
ics. But there’s plenty of good 

slang around. I’m distracted 
cause Kylie Minogue is on the 
telly, sorry. Oh ...“Sweet as!” 
The last record had more dis-
tinctly Kiwi references.
G: The lyric that stands out 
most to me from your new 
record is on “How Kids Fail”: 
“At first it was relatively easy/ 
The garage was an island.” 
Could you tell me a little bit 
about what those words mean 
to you — the concept of a 
garage island?
RM: I’m referring to the garage 
at my mom’s house in Ventura, 
Calif. That’s where I started 
recording in my teens. I would 
go in there by myself and sit

Under no circumstance would I have ever thought to 
recommend a latter-day Nicolas Cage film — con-

sidering they’re as empty as his bank account, 
post-IRS repossession — but after I describe 
the plot of “Knowing,” you might be curious 
enough to check it out. 

It’s not the girl with the power to pre-
dict when and where all humanity’s major 
catastrophes will occur, nor the deadbeat 
scientist on a mission to prevent them 
from happening. No. It’s alien bunnies. 

Now, unless your eyes were pried 
open with a “Clockwork” lithotripsy 

machine at AMC, there’s a good chance 
you didn’t have enough endurance to make 

it through to the last five minutes of the 
film, and 
therefore 
have no 

idea what I’m talking about. But that’s a 
shame, because when two alien bunnies hop 
into the limelight for the last scene, it makes 
the whole excruciating two-hour Ford 
commercial worthwhile. 

Trust me: After watching notorious 
over-actor Cage run in circles yelling lines 
like, “The caves won’t save us! Nothing 
can save us!” while his partially deaf son 
is receiving nightly visits from grown 
Draco Malfoys holding shiny black 
pebbles, you’ll be overcome with thanks 
for the completely nonsensical ending. 
Drumroll please: A wiffle-ball-alien 
vessel straight out of “Independence 
Day” transports the “chosen” children 
to a remote planet of wheat fields and 
(you guessed it) alien bunnies, all 
while our dear old Earth burns to 
a crisp. Don’t believe me? You can’t 
make this shit up.

Kristen Stewart 
is, inarguably, a 
one-dimensional 
actress with a 
blank stare and 
husky voice. So 
why was Plain Jane 
on the cover of every 
magazine in 2009? 
Because Stewert has 
one solid acting tool at 
her disposal: her shiny, 
versatile hair. What could 
translate teenage angst 
better than ten fingers 
running through one vam-
pirically tangled mane every 
15 minutes? You can watch the 
technique in practically every 
film she’s ever been in, from “Into 
the Wild” to the “Twilight” series. 
The pressing question becomes: 
Who needs character development 

when there are greasy tresses to tussle? 
In “Adventureland,” Stewart took this 
attitude to a whole new level, allowing 
a fleet of heavily doused dead cells to 
upstage her acting. Blowing in the wind 
on cue and perfectly coiffed when neces-
sary, her black mop is a highly contributing 
member of whichever cast it graces — too 
bad Stewart is beneath it.

Two films starring mall cops hit the 
screens last year — and that was two more 
than anyone ever needed or wanted to 
see. The first of the pair, “Paul Blart: Mall 
Cop,” was a PG-rated farce of wholesome 
attempts at banana-peel humor, but failed 
to keep our eyelids open past the opening 

credits. 
Then, as if 
it couldn’t 
get any 
worse, Seth 
Rogen’s 

“Report” rode mall-cop mania to a state 
of utter mayhem. In its futile attempt 
to pass as edgy dark comedy, “Observe 
& Report” became the most painfully 
laughless comedy of the year with a 
nearly suicidal protagonist (please, 
just do it) and handicapped humor. 
What’s worse, director Jody Hill even 
claimed his vision for the film that it be 
a comedic version of “Taxi Driver.” As 
the protagonist’s delusions of grandeur 
unravel during attempts to save a hostile 
world in the confines of a shopping mall 
(instead of New York City), we can see 
the birthplace of Hill’s delusions. But 
Rogen is no DeNiro, Hill is no Scorsese 
and the problem with doing a funny 
version of “Taxi Driver” is that it needs 
to be, well, funny.

HIATUS� THURSDAY, MARCH 11, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN�9

R yan McPhun’s merry band of indie shape-shifters has returned, 
but 2010 is a darker spot for 
the Ruby Suns. Fight Softly 
trades in the lo-fi gear and 
mirth of 2008’s Sea Lion 
for a raver sheen that’s as 
much downcast yuppie-
rock as upbeat club-hop, 
with McPhun’s production 
dominating every track.

“Sun Lake Rinsed” starts 
the Kiwis’ new LP off with 
innocuous dream-soul that 
avoids intricacy in search 
of elusive pop “feeling” — a 
timeless vibe to soundtrack 
a late-night teenage car ride 
back to the Auckland ’burbs. 
Like fellow up-and-comers 
Yeasayer, the cheese factor 
of “Mingus and Pike” and 
“Haunted House” revels in 
New Age retro-posing. 

On many cuts, McPhun’s 
genre-dabbling alienates 
whatever bubbly hooks 
were starting to germinate. 
Even “Cinco” — which 
somehow gives the Middle 

East some techno-chic fly — 
forces itself into a lame Enya 
breakdown. 

Still, when the nods to 
McPhun’s parents’ cassette 
collection stick — as on 
“Closet Astrologer” — you’ll 
want to drop everything 
and start your own indie 
Phil Collins tribute band. 
The cut’s dated bass tones 
and synth presets conjure 
an ecstatic live show, which 
is indeed where the Suns 
always seemed most cozy. 

Their studio wizardry 
and attempts at pop tran-
scendence do converge on 
a few tracks, though: The 
intimate “When Kids Fail” is 

electro-crunch carnage that 
deserves a headlining slot on 
this summer’s festival tents. 
And ending with the hilari-
ous image of “Olympics On 
Pot” — whose outro evokes 
the suspense of Nickelodeon 
gameshow “Legends of the 
Hidden Temple”, if acid 
techno had tainted it ’til the 
subwoofers burst — sums 
up the Ruby Suns in a taut, 
worldly package. Softly 
regurgitates 20 years of 
McPhun’s vinyl consumption 
with passive-aggressive glee; 
you’re allowed to dance, but 
strictly to his tune.

Andrew Lloyd Webber
Love Never Dies
DECCA RECORDS

3
10

A ndrew Lloyd Webber may have already established his status 
as a musical-theater great, 
but “Love Never Dies” — 
the sequel to his massively 
successful “Phantom of the 
Opera” — has definitely 
helped to wear out his wel-
come. Even if we ignore 
the cringe-inducing plot, 
in which the Phantom 
(Ramin Karimloo) relocates 
to Coney Island to stalk 
Christine (Sierra Boggess), 
the soundtrack’s emo bag-
gage is a lesson in quitting 
while you’re ahead.

Album highlight “Till I 
Hear Her Sing” shows some 
of the hallmarks that made 
Lloyd Webber a household 
name: soaring, if melo-
dramatic vocals, dramatic 
piano-and-string instrumen-
tation and hurting words 
that tell the story of the 
Phantom’s lingering pain of 
losing Christine go. By stick-
ing to his tried-and-true for-
mula, the English composer 
does remind us why we fell 
in love with his work.

Then “The Beauty 
Underneath” — Lloyd 

Webber’s attempt to tweak 
his soul key for the modern 
listener — reminds us why 
sequels usually suck. The 
track ventures into heavy 
metal territory, pushing 
oddly jarring, disjointed 
amalgamation with snarling 
vocals, guitar riffs, a jaunty 
drumbeat and a screaming 
finale. Although it breaks 
the broody love-ballad 
precedent, “Underneath” 
becomes the end-all indica-
tor that Lloyd Webber is 
trying way too hard. 

From that point on, the 
soundtrack blends together 
into one long, angsty whine. 
“The Phantom Confronts 
Christine” fails as a tumultu-
ous duet between the lovers, 
but turns into an impressive 
vocal exercise for Boggess, 
whose chords climb to awe-
inspiring octaves and vibrate 
with all the trills of a sea-
soned diva. We’re left gaping 
at her inhuman abilities, 
yet are unable to remember

G reen Zone” follows patriotic Chief Miller (Matt Damon) on his hunt for weapons of 
mass destruction through a war-
torn Iraq.  As its WMD team 
raids empty warehouses and other 

abandoned, deteriorating build-
ings, Miller begins to suspect that 
the intelligence arriving from 
undisclosed source “Magellan” 
are bogus. After a series of dead 
ends, a tip from local Iraqi Freddy 
(Khalid Abdalla) leads Miller to a 
meeting of Saddam’s closest con-
sorts. Moxie-filled Miller follows 

a blood-spattered road — lead-
ing him to a mess of government 
cover-ups that he’s determined to 
unveil.

Though “Zone” is bolstered 
and simultaneously crippled by 
its close-to-home plot line — 
revisiting the unraveling Iraq war 
so soon after the WMD debacle 

arouses passionate emotions of 
antagonism from both sides of the 
political spectrum, it wouldn’t be 
nearly as emotionally engaging 
without. 

Struggling with its plot, “Green

Playing part-time lover and full-time friend to 
Ellen Page never gave Michael Cera much time 
to hone a versatile skill set. So it’s only natural 
that he’d play himself in the most abhorrently 
quirky “comedy” of the year: “Paper Heart.” 
Cera’s the awkward turtle that Hollywood recur-
rently beckons from Canadian waters to launch 

cute indie com-
edy after cute 
indie comedy 

to the big time. 
And, somewhere 

between his penchant for sweaty palms and 
googly-eyed stares in “Paper Heart,” we do get 
the sense that Cera’s well aware of just how 
adorable he is.

It’s bad enough that the film centers on the 
humdrum, highly simplified documentary of a 
sheltered young “comedian” (of the non-funny 
variety) questioning the existence of true love 
only to (surprise!) become enamored with 
Cera. But when the lovable dweeb-osaurus 
appears onscreen as himself, “Paper Heart” 
becomes mired in a pathetic attempt to forge 
a new genre in film: Faction. It ends up doing 
for indie love flicks what “The Soloist” did for 
the Oscars: tug all tropes to vie for a nomina-
tion as this year’s best — of course, failing 
miserably. “Paper Heart” may surpass Cera’s 
personal record for the most awkward silenc-
es in a single film, but that’s about it.

When a production company has to put a girl in 
her underwear on the movie poster just to attract 
an audience, you know it’s going to be shitty. 
The plot of “The Unborn” revolves around some 
chick hallucinating about a creepy kid, dead 
twins and — oh, yeah — Nazi Germany. But all 
that doesn’t matter until halfway through the 
movie, when we are greeted by fucking GARY 
OLDMAN. 

Gary! What the heck are you doing here, old 
buddy? Why are you playing a Rabbi and per-
forming exorcisms? Did “The Dark Knight” not 

make you rich enough to feel comfy rejecting 
roles like these? Or were you simply craving spe-

cial effects — no 
matter how shitty 
— to connect with 
a new generation 
of garbage con-

sumers? Hope you can still sleep at night, Gary, 
because after watching dead babies haunt the liv-
ing, I doubt we will.

Films like “Harry Potter” and 
“Shrek” prove that by simply 
combining a successful chil-
dren’s book with some talk-
ing monsters, you can have 
a nation of youngsters eating 

out of 
the palm 
of your 
hand. 
“Where 
the Wild 
Things 

Are” almost got the winning 
recipe right: What could go 
wrong with a treasured child-
hood fable by Maurice Sendak 
and some furry costumes to 
work it? Turns out, in place 
of innocent childsplay, Spike 
Jonze decided to turn the film 
into an adult look at a child’s 
psyche. It’s no surprise that 
confused and terrified children 
dragged their parents out of 
movie theaters across America. 

Lucky for Jonze, where 
there’s a cool soundtrack and 
pretty cinematography, there’s 
a circle who will eat it up: the 
hipsters. With Urban Outfitters 
tees to match, they watched in 
glee as “Wild Things” shed its 
innocence and took its place as 
the latest commercial trend in 
the one-speed repertoire.

Among the sea of delicate acoustic numbers vying 
for the top spot in the Sun 
God Battle of the Bands, 
Seriously promises the sharp 
beeps and strong beats 
we’ll need to start the party 
right. With icy robot synths 
and rock vocals, first track 
“Immaculate Addiction” 
could vaguely resemble Daft 
Punk, if we’re drunk enough. 
It’s a crowd-pleaser with a 
chest-buzzing beat and a 
shiny techno gaudiness that’s 
refreshing in a pool of bland 
hipster minimalism. The lyr-
ics start out self-consciously 
saccharine — mostly 
laments about addiction and 
intoxication — but punchy 
tones, far-off handclaps 
and an emphatic chorus 
proclaiming they can’t stop 
’til they get enough (haven’t 
heard that one before) carry 
attitude to fill the Loft’s 
humble dance floor. 

Seriously’s second sample 
for voters, “Been So Long,” 
takes the glam down a notch 
with plaintive vocals over rip-
pling guitar, taut drumbeats 
and the occasionally twinkle 
of synth. It’s a boy-meets-
girl story, with lyrics catchy 
enough for a sing-along, 
breathy vocals and a wailing 
guitar solo for a little edge.

Other bands may 
boast sweeter sounds or 
more sparkling story, but 
Seriously is a breath of fresh 
air — a loud, unapologetic 
band, here to get the crowd 
pumped for the best day of 
the year.

W e might not have swing-danced since junior high, 
but Mad Traffic’s about to 
give us a reason to dust off the 
moves. The band’s only been 
around since May 2008, but its 
members are veterans at the 
biz: Blaise Garza played sax 
with the Violet Femmes, and 
bassist Chris Murray and gui-
tarist Brian Fleck performed as 
part of reggae group High Tide 
at Sun God Festival 2007. 

The band’s swing-rock 
hinges on the jaunty singing 
of Blaise Guld — yeah, there 
are two Blaises in Traffic — 
like a dapper version of Jim 
Morrison in “People Are 
Strange.” Instead of drowning 
out Guld’s delivery, the drum 
and guitars support it, restrain-
ing themselves to simple and 
insistent rhythms that’ll get 
your head bobbing.

Don’t expect any huge 
choruses, though. Even when 
Traffic repeats riffs to build 
tension, like in “Waiting on 
Luck,” it’s not a prelude to a an 
arena-rock yell-along — just 
a way to make it feel urgent. 
Usually that’d be a massive 
disappointment, but the pro-
longed outro-solo in “Luck” 
satisfies even after the track 
fades out. If you can stand a 
little restraint in your music, 
do us Sun God early birds a 
favor and vote for a band that 
makes it worth rushing the 
wristband booth.

W e’re less than two months from the Sun God festival, and the 25 student bands fighting to be this year’s opener are counting down the days. Only five bands will invade the Loft for a Battle of the Bands on April 3, and you can pick one of them by 
voting at www. sungodfestival.ucsd.edu. The other four will be chosen by A.S. Concerts And Events. Sure, we have no control over 
this year’s headliner, but the opener is in our hands. So boot up your laptop, crank up the speakers and take your pick.

TRACKREVIEWS

‘All We Do Is Win’
DJ Khaled
WE THE BEST/ E1 MUSIC

T he fact that DJ Khaled’s latest has a guest list three times as long as the track’s title should be a blood-red flag for the rap-game weary. He tried the same thing four years ago with “We Takin’ Over,” 
but at least back then, Lil Wayne still had something to say. This time, 
all Khaled pulls from Ludacris and Co. is masturbatory filler, with 
whoops whenever Luda pauses for a breather. Though a couple rising 
synths do lend the beat weight, all illusion of epic climax is stretched 
too thin for even Snoop Dogg to save. T-Pain isn’t inspired into explor-
ing the great big world outside his new iPhone App, either, wheezing 
through the Auto-Tuned chorus until his screeches of “Win!” have 
degraded him from “I’m on a Boat” legend to yesterday’s squeeze toy.

‘Let It Be’
Kris Allen
19 RECORDINGS/ JIVE

N othing like a tragedy to bring out the talentless hacks for a bit of media attention — somehow Kris Allen, the forgettable winner of last season’s “American Idol,” managed to butcher 
the Beatles’ classic “Let It Be” in the name of helping Haiti. Allen’s 
whiny, hyper-emotive voice cuts in over the contemplative piano 
riff, caterwauling the lyrics with self-absorbed sentimentality. 
Allen’s forced vibrato and his insistence on deviating from the 
original melody detracts from its raw beauty, and in an egotis-
tic attempt at showcasing his voice, Allen trashes the original’s 
grandiose middle section and choral backing — amounting to a 
substance-less diddy. He might as well be singing in the shower.

‘Cause and Effect’
Prince
NPG RECORDS

T he fresh batch of fans Prince collected after his rock med-ley Super Bowl 51 performance will probably be thrown off by the funkadelic start of “Cause and Effect.” A wah-wah 
guitar rocks the intro over a fake crowd before downshifting 
into pop-rock blues, a launch point from which Prince’s high-
pitched quaver slithers into your head and sticks. A synthesized 
string orchestra and an interlude where Prince addresses the 
fake crowd keep “Cause” unpredictable and engaging. The fact 
that this doesn’t make the track a confusing mess is a testament 
to the production quality of this fresh and solid song from the 
Artist Formerly Known as the Love Symbol.

UCSD hermits holed up in Geisel library may not be privy to this, but some of their classmates can 
pop, lock and drop it with the best 
of the hip-hop world.  It’s all a part 
of the burgeoning dance scene in 
Southern California that’s managed 
to make a name for itself — in a big 
way — on our very own campus. 

Some of the most talented teams 
in the country will be coming out 
on March 28, when the Multi-Asian 
Student Association (MASA) and 
Second to None (220) dance com-
pany hold their annual Fusion dance 
competition at RIMAC Arena. 

In its 11-year history, Fusion 
has become one of the most promi-
nent hip-hop competitions on the 
West Coast and the largest Asian-
American-directed student-run 

event at UCSD. Seating over 3,000 
attendees, the competition has seen 
an incredible increase in turnout 
over the past few years.    

Crews like Jabbawockeez and 
Poreotics — both from MTV’s 
“America’s Best Dance Crew” — have 
performed at RIMAC Arena in pre-
vious years.  With the inclusion of 
such well known and high-caliber 
teams, the competition at FUSION 
has grown exponentially.  

“The competition’s stakes con-
tinue to increase every year,” said 
220 member, FUSION coordinator 
and Sixth College junior Chesley 
Tolentino.  “Teams continually keep 
progressing and getting more cre-
ative, which makes the stakes even 
higher than the year before.”

Though 220 does not compete, 
because they coordinate the event 
they typically perform as an exhibi-
tion team instead.  Competing teams 

include “ABDC” favorites Kaba 
Modern, as well as groups from 
various colleges and studios across 
California. The coordinators hope 
these teams will embody the strong 
dance world of Southern California 
and San Diego.  

“We feel ‘America’s Best Dance 
Crew’ gives a very limited view of the 
hip-hop dance community,” FUSION 
coordinator and Sixth College junior 
Kathy Fan said. “There are so many 
teams right here in San Diego that 
can compete with the very best.”

Southern California’s booming 
hip-hop scene will certainly be well-
represented at the show.  Several of 
the competing teams are from UC 
Irvine in particular, where “their 
dance is kind of like their football 
team,” Tolentino said. “That’s how 
big and famous their dancers are.”  

And the performers definitely 
show just as much commitment to 

their art as any D-I football player. 
“Most of the competing teams 

are petty intense,” Tolentino said.  
“Sometimes they practice everyday 
until five in the morning and then 
go to school at 8 a.m. Every team 
wants to raise up the intensity and 
difficulty of their routines, so they 
have to work extra hard every year.”  

Besides providing dancers a 
platform for competition, the event’s 
coordinators also aim to bring 
awareness and visibility to Asian-
Americans in the dance world.  

“Fusion is, quite literally, the 
annual fusion of the two organiza-
tions to put on a show that reflects 
both the love of dance from 220 and 
the importance of Asian-American 
culture from MASA,” Fan said.  

By combining MASA’s goals with 
220’s talents, the two groups hope 
to demonstrate the growing promi-
nence of Asian-Americans in the 

hip-hop community.  
“Asian-Americans never really had 

a voice and were kind of the minor-
ity in the hip-hop community,” said 
Tolentino. “It has progressed so much 
over the years, so that now Asian-
Americans are everywhere in hip-hop.”

Accordingly, the organizers have 
chosen this year’s competition theme 
to be “Dimensions of a Generation.”

“[The theme] focuses on the fact 
that the presence and breakthroughs 
of Asian Americans in the hip-hop 
community are not limited to just our 
generation but the ones before and 
definitely the ones after,” Fan said. 

Fusion will also include art, spo-
ken word, music and other cultural 
acts — notably performances from 
UCSD’s Kaibigang Pilipino Club 
and the Daughters of Triton vocal 
ensemble.  

Fusion will be held at RIMAC 
Arena on March 28 at 6 p.m.  

FESTIVALPREVIEW



12�THE UCSD GUARDIAN� MONDAY, MARCH 11, 2010� HIATUS

an identity separate from the lat-
est Bourne films. Fiery explosions, 
a barrage of bullets and nonstop 
high-speed chases on foot, in cars 
and by helicopter whets all the 
appetites of action-connoisseurs 
that were left dry once “Bourne 
Supremacy” finished its theatric 
run. “Zone” successfully brings 

the reality of Iraq to the American 
cinema.  Scenes of gritty dirt-
covered streets and buildings rav-
aged with poverty provoke pangs 
of sympathy — as civilians dash 
sporadically through the chaos, 
screeching as their clothing blooms 
crimson blood. Miller’s trip to the 
local penitentiary is equally bone-

rattling: set to a ominous score, he 
travels amongst rows of prisoners in 
squalor each sporting black hoods 
or beaten so badly that their skin is 
hanging from their bones. “Zone” 
adopts its predecessors unpopu-
lar attributes as well — the shaky 
camera hand. A characteristic of 
Greengrass’ work, the technique is 
utilized in excess throughout the 

film, inciting some 
moments of unpleas-
ant “Cloverfield” 
vertigo.

Another 
Greengrass staple, 
Matt Damon, in his 
performance as Miller, 
both successfully 
and unremarkably 
walks the blurry line 
of national loyalty — 
he never outwardly 
betrays his country. 
Instead he confuses 
his audience, delving 
into the bowels of the 
American intel, carv-
ing out injustices and 
shooting up Iraqis 
like a true patriot. 
Abdalla’s impas-
sioned performance as 
Miller’s Iraqi sidekick 
is the most convinc-
ing — his desperate, 
breathless pleas on 
behalf of the Iraqi 
people add humanity 
to the film’s otherwise 
holistic bloodbath.

Though ironically un-rev-
olutionary, “Green zone” is an 
unashamed political action-flick 
which arouses adequate levels of 
anxious bile and American humil-
ity — doused with just enough 
dynamite to keep it from becom-
ing too tangled in its own political 
introspective.

- and don’t forget to tell them the Guardian referred you.  

whelming majority on campus.
Those who care enjoy a healthy 

social life by participating in stu-
dent orgs and attending on-campus 
events, forging a community in the 
starved business-park landscape 
that is La Jolla. They’re conscious of 
what goes on at school. Although 
they often feel hopeless in such a 
barren atmosphere, they do their 
best to seek others who care. They’re 
inclusive, but they stick together and 
bond on the tiny island that rests 
in a sea of the majority: those who 
don’t.

This other mass of students isn’t 
fully at fault for not caring — com-
petition is fierce here, so constant 
study sessions are essential to grad-
school acceptance — but in the past 
few weeks of real pain and frustra-
tion, chants of “Whose university?” 
made it abundantly clear who has 
shaped this school more than any-
one else: the apathetic. They are 
the majority; they are oblivious and 
often selfish. 

To these students — many of 
whom I realize don’t bother to read 
this paper — I ask you all to please 
take a deep breath and look outside 
yourself. Are you happy with your 
university? More importantly, are 
you satisfied with your life here? 
Forget the free speech debate, forget 
whether or not you think the Koala’s 
funny, forget the absurd idea that we 
live in a “post-racial” society (what-
ever that means) — just picture a 
black student coming here as a fresh-
man, not knowing anyone. Do you 
honestly believe that this campus 
would provide a nurturing environ-
ment for him or her? 

To me, that seems like a nearly 
impossible task — at least, as the 
school stands today. I came here 
with the same skin color as about 
40 percent of my peers, and for over 
a year I’d never felt more alone in 
my life. The only reason I survived 
UCSD is because a small, tight-knit 
group of Guardian editors and writ-
ers formed a social scene in a vacu-
um, managing an elusive good time 

on an island of our own. These were 
friends I could party with, have close 
conversation with, create a commu-
nity with — basically, human beings. 
I can’t thank them enough for that. 
They are the reason I will leave this 
confused institution with some dig-
nity, knowing that we did our best 
to influence the apathetic boulder’s 
path toward self-interest. Because it’s 
not all about you.  

I felt a mix of serious pride and 
exhaustion as many of us walked 
out of the administration’s teach-in, 
chanting “Real pain, real action,” 
like we depended on those words 
to endure here. It didn’t matter 
that we were only a few hundred 
shouting our heads off while thou-
sands upon thousands of kids in 
rooms all across campus stared at 
PowerPoints with glazed eyeballs. 
For the first time, I actually felt 
honored to call myself a UCSD 
student. Thank you, those who 
care, for sharing these few prized 
moments with me. It feels like a sea 
change.

at my little eight-track and record 
for hours and hours. I’d record stuff 
all day, and by 3 a.m., I’d have a 
track finished. I was just calling it an 
island ’cause I was there alone, and I 
felt like I could do whatever I wanted 
there. I was a really anxious and shy 
kid, so it provided a great respite 
from my school life.
G: I saw you guys play at the Cuba 
St. Carnival in Wellington last sum-
mer when I was studying abroad 
there, and it seemed like the perfect 
setting and season for your music. 
But what’s your favorite show envi-
ronment and why?

RM: Random! That was kind of 
a weird show because the audi-
ence was such a cross section of 
Wellington. I’m sure plenty of people 
there thought we were weirdos, but it 
was OK ’cause we had lots of friends 
there, and got some friends and my 
sister — who was over from the U.S. 
— up to play with us. Probably my 
favorite show was at a summer festi-
val we have here called Camp A Low 
Hum. It’s quite an informal festival, 
and we’ve played there the last three 
years; 2009 was my favorite year. We 
played pretty much in the forest, sur-
rounded by huge trees. We were hav-
ing a great time, and the crowd was 

super pumped too. 
G: So what’s the current lineup for 
this tour, and what plans do you 
have going forward to the end of the 
year?
RM: I’ve got a new group of friends 
coming on this next bit of touring. 
Alistair Deverick on drums and 
Graham Panther on bass, synth and 
other stuff. I mostly play guitar and 
my drum pad. And sing, of course. 
We’ve got the next few months agot 
tentative touring plans through to 
the Northern Hemisphere’s autumn. 
We’ll probably get back to NZ when 
it starts warming up again. Three 
summers in a row!

TRITONS SWEEP PIONEERS TO MAKE IT TEN STRAIGHT
By Cameron Tillisch
S����� S���� W�����

BASEBALL  In their first series 
on the road, the No. 2 UCSD mens 
baseball team mixed an effective 
balance of pitching and offense to 
sweep its fourth series of the season 
against Cal State East Bay on March 
6, winning by scores of 5-3, 3-2, 12-7 
and 18-5. UCSD improved to 19-3 
overall, 10-2 in California Collegiate 
Athletic Association action while the 
Pioneers fell to 5-13-1 overall, and 
2-10 in CCAA play. 

UCSD showcased a couple of 
solid outings off of the mound. In 
the first game, junior starting pitcher 
Tim Shibuya improved to 5-0 by 
tossing nearly seven innings, scat-
tering nine hits and allowing three 
earned runs. Shibuya cruised through 
five innings, but let up in the final 
two frames allowing one run in the 
sixth inning, and two in the sev-
enth. However senior first baseman 
Brandon Gregorich and junior catch-
er Michael Benton provided ample 
offense, hitting two RBIs a piece to 
help the Tritons to a 5-3 win.

In game two, junior right-hander 
Guido Knudson made his second 
start of the season after being moved 
from the closer role into the rota-
tion. Coming off of a no-hit bid in 
his first start, Knudson once again 
proved comfortable in a starting role. 
He electrified opposition hitters  
pitching a complete game, striking 
out 11 Pioneers and allowing just two 
earned runs  and led UCSD to a 
victory despite receiving only 3 runs 
of support from the offense. 

As a team, over the series we 
found ways to get out of jams on 
the mound and avoid the big inning 
while the offense had timely hit-
ting, Knudson said. Solid defense 
as usual leads to good things all the 
way around, and we played well in 
the field. We had guys step up out of 
the bullpen in tight games. Basically, 
we found ways to pick each other up 
in each game and get a win.

Knudson was also quick to cred-
it his pitching performance to his 
catchers and the advice of assistant 
coach Ryan Leake.

For me on the mound, the abil-
ity to mix well and locate fastballs 
consistently was the key, Knudson 
said. I think me, [junior catchers] 
Mike Benton and Kellen Lee and 
Leake really had a good approach to 
their hitters, and kept them off bal-
ance with pitches down in the zone. 
Catchers did an awesome job and 
deserve much of the credit for that 
game, as well as Coach Leake calling 
a great game, Knudson said.

The Tritons, who boast a .385 team 
batting average, brought their bats 
with them on Saturday and Sunday 
after lackluster offensive output on 
Fridays doubleheader. On Saturday, 
the heart of the order showed up as 
Gregorich and junior third baseman 
Evan Kehoe combined for six hits and 

eight RBIs.
The support was enough to 

pick up senior right-hander Matt 
Rossman, who was not as sharp as 
usual. Rossman, usually in command 
of the opposition, walked four hit-
ters but grinded out five and one-
third innings allowing just three 
earned runs. The senior showed grit 
and exemplified how a veteran gets 
through a game even without his 
best material. The Tritons beat the 
Pioneers 12-7 in the game. 

They were definitely a better 
team than their record reflected, 
Rossman said. They had some good 
arms and battled pretty well at the 
plate. Our offense battled all week-
end, and we played solid defense on 
a rain-soaked field from the days 

prior.
Seeking a series sweep in game 

four, the UCSD offense exploded 
for 22 hits and 18 runs on Sunday. 
Leading the onslaught was senior 
outfielder Robert Sedin, who went 
three for four with a home run and 
five RBIs. Lee notched four hits of his 
own including a homer, and junior 
left fielder Aaron Bauman went deep, 
finishing three for four with three 
runs and three RBIs.

Although the offense effectively 
decided the result, senior right-hand-
er Kirby St. John had a nice outing, 
going six innings and allowing just 
two runs. 

We will prepare for the next 
series with high-intensity practices 
just like we do every week, Knudson 

said. Its no different week in and 
week out; we just go out and have 
quality practices. This team has a 
great chemistry and has a good time, 
and it keeps us going week in and 
week out. We play Sonoma this week, 
but it does nothing to change our 
preparation.

The Tritons return to Triton 
Baseball Stadium for another home 
stand on March 12 as they host 
Sonoma State. The Seawolves are 
8-9, 2-6 CCAA so far this year. Last 
year, Sonoma State took three of four 
games in conference play, and the 
Tritons got revenge by taking three of 
four in postseason action.

SPORTSÊ THURSDAY, MARCH 11, 2010Ê THE UCSD GUARDIAN 15 

TheÊBallerÊ
RivalryÊBegins
the season with 14 consecutive wins, 
a school record start to the sea-
son. But when the Tritons traveled 
to Lumberjack Arena on Jan. 21, 
Humboldt gave them more than they 
could handle, breaking the Tritons’ 
perfect start with an 84-80 victory. 

UCSD then hosted the 
Lumberjacks on Feb. 26 for the reg-
ular-season finale, looking to avenge 
their early season loss. The game 
was essentially over by halftime, as 
the Tritons crushed the Lumberjacks 
86-51. Only a week later, on March 5, 
the Tritons returned to Lumberjack 
Arena and were once again stunned 
by Humboldt, losing 82-78 as the 
Lumberjacks advanced to the tourna-
ment final.

The Tritons will have to step 
up their defense to have a chance 
against the Lumberjacks, who are 
the best three-point-shooting team 
in the conference. Humboldt made 
11 three-pointers in the team’s last 
meeting, including eight in the sec-
ond half.

“Humboldt is playing extremely 
well right now, and we are going 
to have to do a better job defend-
ing,” head coach Charity Elliott said. 
“It’s tournament time, which means 
everyone is playing a with a greater 
sense of urgency.”

The Tritons will also need to cool 
the hot hand of Andrea Bobic, a 
second-team all-CCAA player that 
led the conference in three-pointers, 
not to mention shot 42 percent from 
beyond the arc. 

The first three rounds of the tour-
nament will be played on a neutral 
court at Seattle Pacific University. If 
the Tritons can get past Humboldt 
State, they will face the winner of the 
Western Washington University and 
Chico State matchup the following 
night. 

“We are very excited to be playing 
in the NCAA tournament,” Elliott 
said. “This is what we’ve been waiting 
for. It’s time to put it all together and 
see what happens.”

SOFTBALL — The UCSD women’s 
softball players finally started seeing 
the fruits of their labor when they 
played San Francisco State on March 
5-6, winning three of their four head-
to-head games. The Tritons scored 
decisive wins in the two-day encoun-
ter, a reversal from last week’s series 
against Sonoma State that saw them 
drop three out of four. Following 
the series win in San Francisco, the 
Tritons came home to sweep non-
conference opponents Dixie State 
College in a double header on March 
9 at the RIMAC softball diamond. 

“We worked really hard in prac-
tice, and really knew this 
was our turning point,” 
junior infielder Jennifer 
De Fazio said. “We came 
together, finally started 
hitting like a team and 
executed everything we 
needed to make the nec-
essary adjustments.” 

In the first game 
against San Francisco, 
the Gators only managed 
one run against sopho-
more Camille Gaito and 
junior Brittany Sheats, 
who worked the mound 
effectively. Gaito struck 
out seven Gators and allowed five hits 
throughout the game before Sheats 
relieved her, holding the San Francisco 
scoreless in the seventh inning. 

Although they initially strug-
gled against the Gator pitching, the 
Tritons started to inflict damage once 
they made the necessary adjustments 
in their approach at the plate.

In the third inning, sophomore 
outfielder Kellin Haley doubled in 
junior outfielder Kris Lesovsky to put 
the Tritons on the board and tie the 
score 1-1. 

Back-to-back doubles from cap-
tain senior catcher Nicole Saari and 
freshman infielder Nicole Spangler 
secured UCSD’s win, combining for 
three of five Tritons runs in the fifth 
inning. The Triton defense held off 
the Gators till the seventh inning and 
the team won 6-1. 

“Our hitting came together; we 

rallied a lot of runs together, and 
really merged as a team,” junior 
infielder Jennifer De Fazio said. 

Lesovsky was the star of Friday’s 
game, hitting a lead off homerun 
to left field to put the Tritons up 
1-0 early. Costly errors in the third 
inning gave San Francisco State a run 
that tied the game, but the Tritons 
came back in the fourth inning 
thanks to a single from freshman 
infielder Katie Belanger that allowed 
junior outfielder Katrin Gabriel to 
score. Lesovsky’s sacrifice fly also 
brought home junior outfielder 
Lyndsay Gaylord. 

The Tritons finished off the day 
strong when sophomore pitcher 
Tess Granath struck out seven Gator 

hitters in the final 4.2 
innings. After coming 
back from an injury in 
the fall, her career-high 
strikeout tally was anoth-
er example of the Tritons’ 
strong pitching. 

“It’s great to see her 
back,” head coach Patti 
Gerckens said. “She did 
a great job, came in, and 
shut them down.” 

Saturday’s double-
header began with the 
Gators scoring a 3-1 vic-
tory, threatening to earn 
a series split. However, in 

the second game, UCSD broke open 
a scoreless tie with nine runs in the 
final inning to claim the game 9-2, 
and the series 3-1. 

The Tritons took the lead in the 
first game, tacking on a run from 
a Saari double that scored junior 
infielder Sarah Woofter. However the 
UCSD offense would stagnate, and 
San Francisco State scored a winning 
total of three runs.

“We are not where we want to be, 
but we are getting there with each 
game,” Gerckens said. 

Tritons bats came alive in the sec-
ond game, posting a nine-spot on the 
scoreboard in the seventh inning. De 
Fazio started things off with a single 
to the centerfield, and was brought 
home by Saari’s bunt single for the 
first run of the game. 

Then, a tactical decision by 
Tritons hitters — to keep their weight 

on their back foot when at the plate 
— enabled them to drive their hands 
through the ball, hit outside pitch-
es to the opposite field and string 
together base hits. 

“We came together to worked on 
getting players on the bases, mov-
ing them to scoring positions and 
eventually scoring our runners,” De 
Fazio said. 

The Tritons also executed with 
two outs, scoring seven more runs. 
Saari, Defazio, senior shortstop 
Mandi Eliades and Spangler each 
tallied two hits apiece. San Francisco 
State’s attempt to rally in runs fell 
short, ending the game 9-2.

“We played our strength, did the 
little things right and came out win-
ning,” Gerckens said.  

Tritons kept the ball rolling with a 
sweep of Dixie State College in their 
March 9 doubleheader at RIMAC. 
They won 8-2 in the first game and 
3-2 in the second, propelling them to 
a 13-9 overall season record.

The team will hope to carry their 
current form into a two-day dou-
bleheader against conference rival 
Cal State Stanislaus on March 12 to 
March 13.

        and this time,                     the stakes can’t get any higher.
