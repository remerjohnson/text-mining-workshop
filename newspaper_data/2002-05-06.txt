Interim freshman senators 
appointed by college councils 
Former A.S. candidate Parent also appointed last week 
By LAURA McGANN 
Staff Writer 

While last year's freshman sen-
ators from John Muir and Revelle 
Colleges move on to their new 
positions, interim freshman sena-
tors have been appointed to fill 
their positions. 

Muir College Council voted to 
appoint Colin Parent, the outgo-
ing commissioner of student ser-
vices and enterprises, last week to 
the position of interim freshman 

senator. 
The freshman interim senator 

position requires the office-hold-
er to represent the freshmen at his 
or her respective college. The 
interim senators hold the position 
until a freshman is appointed by 
his or her respective college coun-
cil during fifth week of fall quar-
ter. 

"Some members of the depart-
ing council have raised concerns 
over a priority for me for the ten-
week term," Parent said.

One of Parent's main goals as 
freshman interim senator will be 
to create a "know your rights" 
campaign, which would seek to 
inform freshmen, not only at 
Muir, but campuswide, of their 
rights as on-campus residents. 

Revelle College Council 
appointed a current freshman, 
Deepa Ravindranath. 

"We appointed her because she 
was qualified," said former Revelle

University taking 
Koala to J, Board 
Humor publication charged 
with disrupting org's meeting 
By EVAN McLAUGHLIN 
Associate News Editor 

Representatives of Tlu Koala 
will appear before UCSD's 
Judicial Board on May 13. 
Members of The Koala are 
charged with violating student 
conduct code 22 .14.10.27 by dis-
turbing a Movimiento Estudiantil 
Chicano de Azd an meeting in 
November 2001 , according to The 
Koala's editor in chief, Geoge 
Liddle. 

The Judicial Board hearing 
comes after The Koala rejected a 
university-initiated informal reso-
lution that would have suspended 
the publication from campus for 
one year while placing The Koala 
on probation for another five years, 
according to Liddle. 

UCSD officials would not con-
firm that formal Judicial Board 
procedures are being carried out 

against The Koala due to campus 
policies regarding the confiden tia l-
ity of student conduct Butters . 
However, sources closelv related to 
the investigation as \~ell as The 
Koala said the hearings are sched-
uled for next week. 

According to Liddle, the publi-
cation is drawing fire from the 
UCSD ad mini stration because 
Koala members attended a MEChA 
meeting Nov. 19,2001, where pho-
tographs of MEChA officer 
Ernesto Martinez were taken . 
Although the photographs of 
Martinez were used in an issue of 
The Koala later that month, Liddle 
contends that a person without any 
Koala or UCSD affil iation submit-
ted the photos to the humor paper. 

Martinez would not comment 
on the investigation. 

According to Liddle, The Koala

UCSD 
students 
get 'Hands 
On' in SD 
Event featured 18 
different volunteer 
options for students 
By BRENT HECHT 
Staff Writer 

Over 300 UCSD students gave up 
studying for a day on May 4 and instead 
participated in Hands On San Diego. 

The annual one-day event spon-
sored by UCSD's Volunteer 
Connection allowed students to choose 
from many local volunteer opportuni-
ties displayed on the Sun God lawn. 
Students then dispersed with their vol-
unteer choic'!S throughout San Diego. 

Participants had 18 different vol-
unteer options, which included clean-
up projects, helping the elderly and 
feeding the hungry. 

Although specific goals varied, the 
Hands On San Diego participants 
shared a common passion for volun-
teering. 

"I like doing things for other peo-
ple," said Thurgood Marshall 
College freshman Rebecca Funke. "I 
was just looking for something to vol-
unteer for." 

Fellow volunteers Roxana 
Vatanparast and Karendip Braich con-
curred. "We just wanted to help out." 

While many of the volunteers 
were individuals or informal groups 
of friends, official student associa-
tions also attended. 

"We [had] some sororities, we 
[had] some fraternities," said head 
organiz.er Kimmy Chela. "A few 
sports teams, the pre-med club and 
the Marshall RAs also [did] it '" we 
[had) a whole bunch of groups." 

The men's volleyball team was one 
such group. 

"We're just reversing the flow of 
student apathy," said men's volleyball 
player Nate Jones. 

Students volunteering for a 
Special Olympics track meet were 
mainly enlisted as one-person cheer-
ing squads. E2ch volunteer was part-
nered with an individual athlete and 
assigned the task of keeping the ath-
lete's spirits high. 

Revelle freshmen Kaitlyn Lucas 
and Andrea Bryan were assigned the 
duty of passing out Special Olympics 
medals to victorious athletes. 
Although the process did not involve 
the dramatic festivities of the Summer 
Olympics medal ceremonies, the ath-
letes' smiles were just as big. 

"This is great," Lucas said, bear-
ing a grin herself. Lucas said she and 
Bryan signed up for Hands On San 
Diego with the rest of the girls in 
their Revelle suite. 

Other opportunities in this year's 
Hands On San Diego included throw-
ing a Cinco ' de Mayo party for the 
elderly, serving breakfast to the home-
less and helping Miramar Land6ll's 
native plant nursery to restore habitats. 

Some UCSD volunteers who 
chose to help children paint a mural 
at San Diego's Children's Museum 
had similarly high spirits. 

"The students are just having a 
great time," said Cleda-Marie 
Simmons, the designer of the mural 
and an internationally recognized 
American painter. 

Volunteers at the Children's 
Museum taught young painters how to 
usc a paintbrush, how to stay ~ithin 
lines, how to keep paint on me mural 
and off meir domes, and omer basics of 
painting. The volunteers also touched 
up some of me children~ worle. 

MVolunteering at a place Hke this 
reminds you that San Diego has a 
spirit," said Roosevelt senior and 
Children's Museum volunteer Margie 
Himes. MSometimes UCSD seems 
kind of cold."

. Council table at 12:20 a.m. Thu in Price 

Center BaUroom A. The meeting began at the dose of 
the last A.S. Coonel meeting for the previous council. 

The new council efficiently beRan its duties by 
appointing the new President Pr~fempore, Eleanor 
Roosevelt College Senior Senator Wendy Ho. Ho's 
duty will be to run meetings in the absence of Vice 
President Intemal Kevin Hsu. 

Senators to sit on the finance and internal com-
mittees, ~'nted by A.S. President .lenn Brown, 
were quO approved by consensus. Brown said 
that she too gender, college and dass year into con-
sideration when placing senators. . 

Even with considerations taken, the committees 
ultimately tended to be what senators had request-
ed initially. Both new and veteran council membelS 
alike announced positive intentions during their first 
reports of the year.

Commissioner of Communications Navneet Grewal 
during the meeting. 

Secondhand smoke vanishing 
into thin air according to study 

Prohibiting smoking in indoor workplaces is effec-
tively reducing exposure to secondhand smoke 
among aduk workers, according to the findings of 
several phone surveys conducted by researchers at 
the Rebecca and John Moores UCSD Cancer Center. 

The study, which was funded by a grant from the 
National Cancer Institute, also indicates that the 
number of smoke-free wOOplaces in Califomia 
increased from 35 percent in 1990 to over 93 per-
cent in 1999. 

However, 31 percent of bar and restaurant 
employees reported being exposed to secondhand 
smoke, which led researchers to recommend 
increased enforcement efforts in those venues. 

The phone surveys were conducted in 1990, 
1992, 1996 and 1999 for the Califomia Department 
of Health Services. The report was principally written 
by Elizabeth A. Gilpin, a member of the Cancer 
Prevention and Control Program at the Moores 
UCSD Cancer Center.

eNer 30 teams from all over the world attend-
ed the annual competition, which gives real-world 
aircraft design experience to engineering stu-
dents. 

The winning plane was made of a combination 
of fiberglass, carbon and foam, making it extremely

Sdence academy calls UCSD 
cloud researcher clear winner 

The National Academy of Sciences recently elect-
ed v. Ramanathan, director of the Scripps Center for 
Clouds, to its organization. 

Members of NAS are elected in recognition of 
their distinguished and continuing achievements in 
original scientific research. Ramanathan was recog-
nized for his research on the effects of greenhouse 
gases. as well as the role of cloud and water vapor 
on radiative feedbacks in dimate change and in reg-
ulating ocean temperatures. 

Ramanathan has already setved on numerous 
national and international scientific committees for 
dimate and atmosPheric studies. He has also p!.b-
lished many articles and books on the dimate 
effeds of trace IMSI5. Ramanathan'i"s~ honors include the 2002 
Rossby Research Medal from the American 
. MeteoioIotv Society, the Buys Ballot Medal from the 
Royal Ned1erIands Academy ' of Sciences in 1995 
and a medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement 
from NASA in 1989. 

"Muir council passes ban on slate politics," which appeared in the May 2 edition, 
incorrecdy stated that a change to the Thurgood Marshall College Council consti-
tution that would have banned senatorial candidates from running on a slate failed 
to gamer a single vote. The change actually failed to pass by a single vote. The 
GuardUm regrets the error.

Recognizing our better 
HA 

f\brthem 
California 
By JEFFREY WHITE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Hop on Interstate 5 and drive for 
hella long. If you hit the border, turn 
around; repeat. 

But first , sell that surfboard. 
Donate any garment with the word 
Independent, Volcom, Hurley or 
Roxy on it to the local Veterans' 
Associatioll. Put on some damn shoes. 
Inspect the rim of your.toilet; that's what 
color your hair is supposed to be. You're 
not really blonde, remember? 

When you see a sign for 
1-580, you're there. 
NorCal. Note the "r." 

It's a st range land . 
What's that? It's not a palm 
tree - it must be some SOrt of 
other tree. What's this' We just left 
one town and we're not yet in the next 
town. Is that some sort of new sport? 
[('S football. We have that here. Is 
that the sky? It 's blue. Why am I so 
cold' I told you, put on some damn 
shoes. Reefs don't COllllt. 

Northern California versus 
SOllthern California: The rivalry has 
existed since at least the founding of the UC 
system. Each year, boys and girls fresh out of high 
school show up at their respective UC campuses, 
and each year, they all make the observation that 
people from the other half of California are a bit 
different. 

Some say "hella," others say "grip." Some wonder 
why others feel the need to put a definite article 
before the name of a highway. Dorm friendships 
formed between Dodgers fans and Giants fans seem 
tenuous and perpetually on the verge of fisticuffs. 
Dining hall disputes over how much colder it actually is 
lip there can become ugly, but the peace is generally kept. 

Happily, the debate rages beyond freshman year. Even 
better, I am on the winning side. Don't get me wrong: I'm 
not saying Northern California is superior. It's just better. 

We're in college, so let's begin with the booze. 
There is a region in NorCal that is literally called "wine 
country" - and all those people thought the land of milk 
and honey sounded good. In this beautiful region, all 
one has to do is walk into a winery, and the hos-
pitable staff will provide glasses of their best -
often for free . They even supply spittoons. 

Alas, there is no Southern California equivalent 
to the grape-laden regions of Napa, Sonoma and 
Mendocino. Go into a store in Los Angeles or San 
Diego and check Out the wine section. AJI the good stuff 
IS from up north, and the few wines from Southern 
California are generally allocated to the lower shelves. 

No SoCal versus NorCal discussion is complete without 
addressing professional sports. 

Los Angeles, population 3.7 million, has no football 
team. This is serious. Neither the Rams nor the Raiders 
could stand it there, and neither team was even any good 
until it finally jumped ship. 

Northern California, on the other hand, is steeped in football 
tradition. The San Francisco 4gers are one of the most successful sports 
organizations in history, responsible for Jerry Rice, Joe Montana and the 
West Coast Offense. The Oakland Raiders had their own dynasty in the 
1970s, led by John Madden and a punishing defense. 

The best thing about the San Diego Chargers is Seau's restaurant, and 
that's overpriced. 

Baseball is where it gets interesting: The Dodgers and the Giants are solid 
squads (though the Dodgers certainly pay a lot more for theirs), and the 
Padres and Athletics have their good years, too. We need not mention the Angels. 

With baseball, it is the fans that tip the scales in favor of the north. Giants and Dodgers 
fans are pretty co.mparable in their fervor, but it's the other teams that show the disparity. 

In 1997, slghongs of Padres hats around San Diego were few and far between. In 1998, the 
year they went to the World Series, all of a sudden everyone around here became a lifelong Padres fan

California 
By JENNIFER SPOSITO 
Opinion Editor 

What is it about Northern California that makes its inhabitants 
think they can flaunt their hubris once they are south of )(jngs County? 

Surely all have encountered this type before - Northern 
~alifornians pervade territory that should, by rights, be alien to them, glut-

ong the finer half of the state with their locust-like, infectious presence. 
Northern Californians arrive in Southern California, and the first 

thing they want to do is gripe: about the purported superiority of their barren 
northern wasteland, about the so-called lack of culture south of San Jose. Stick 

a Northern Californian in Southern California for 10 minutes, and first she'll 
start complaining about how the bread down here is no good, and you can't find 

a decent pesto sauce or raspberry vinaigrette; then, how everybody in Southern 
California is so fake; then, how San Francisco is the most beautiful, diverse, classy 
city the world has ever seen - ad nauseam. 

It is widely repeated that the moniker" oCal" is irksome and belittling to 
Northern Californians. Consequently, we shall use it to refer to that region for 

the duration of this article. 
NoCal's singular defining characteristic is its immitiga~le arrogance in 

the face of any challenge to its alleged superiority. How frustrating it is, 
too, that a reasonably beautiful portion of the state should be so choked 

with foolish, pretentious jerks - it's like a colony for them all. 
Wake-up call, NoCal'ers: Your snooty seaboard basi n is not the 

center of the universe. It is far from it. There is no cultural environ-
ment in the Bay area that canno t be had in Los Angeles or San 

Diego. A plethora of ethnicities, socioeconomic conditions, world-
renowned universities, quirky neighborhoods: We have them all . 

You do not hold a monopoly on ballets, operas, restaurants or 
even bookstores and coffee hops, though you seem to think 

it. Did we mention that we make all those movies you come 
slavishly to patronize day in and day out? 

Southern California can count among its many 
blessings its gorgeous weather. What are people think -

ing when they banter about "California's" great 
weather? It is obviously concentrated in the lower 

half of the state. Take a tourist to San Francisco in 
the summer, and you had better remind him to 

bring his winter coat. And don't even try going 
for a swim at San Francisco's Baker Beach 

unless it's August. NoCal is a waste of 
beach-front property, though at least 
surfers make something of it. 

NoCal'ers exhibit an 
arrogance th~t l. seems to manifest 
itself in the worst 

.. ~ kind of sniveling, fake 
behavior possible . Quite 
simply, it is borne of their 

belief that they are 
things which they are 

obviously not: dra-
matically impor-
tant, and central 
to the universes 
operation. 

The worst of these types are 
the rich-bitch, New Money resi-
dents perching in the hills and 
valleys of the San Francisco 
East Bay. Paying too much for 
a quarter-acre plot of land and 
a prefab house is nothing to 
feel superior about, people. 
The East Bay is a motley 
collection of overpaid base-
ball players, dot-com CEOs 
and mindless upper-middle 
class professionals. True 
Los Angeles residents 
complain about that dirge 
to the north, the San 

Fernando Valley. These people 
have obviously never had to contend 

with a decade of living in the East Bay'S 
capital of pestilent contagion, Walnut 

Creek, and one hopes that they never will .

Team mascots should not stir offense 
University symbols praise cultural heritage 
By CHRIS TAYLOR 
Contributing Writer 

It has been said that a problem is 
not a problem until you give it 
credibility. The best example of this 
is the recent uproar over college 
mascots: They are never a problem 
until people decide to make them a 
problem. Taking offense to college 
mascots only proves tha-{ some peo-
ple spend way too much time being 
offended. 

Just last week, San Diego State 
University began another set of 
meetings and councils concerning 
the unveiling of a new mascot. 
Apparently, the politically correct 
Ambassador Montezuma didn't 
work Out like the university had 
planned. 

Ambassador Montezuma is 
unpopular. not because it accurate-
ly depicts traditional Aztec culture, 
but rather because it has failed to 
do what a mascot is supposed to do: 
It does not encourage school spirit. 
In fact, it had the opposite effect, 
because most srudenrs were 
annoyed that it was merely an 
appeasement to the activists who 
were pressuring the school. 

The co mplaints began in late 
1999, when the SDSU Native 
American Student Alliance com-
plained that mascot Monty 
Montezuma was offensive to any-
one of Aztec descent. They 
demanded a new school mascot. 
Though SDSU kept the Aztecs, it 
destroyed Monty, which had been 
the mascot si nee 1941 . 

The problem does not stop with 
SDSU. Schools across the nation 
have been under attack for mascots 
ranging from Native Americans to 
the "satanic" Red Devils of the 
Nebo High School District in Utah. 

The argument is that any mas-
COt depicting a culture or race 
insults that group by making its 
image into a caricature. This is 
racist, according to the activist 
groups. Therefore, they say, 
schools should eliminate mascots 
that offend particular cultures. 

This argument is a waste of time 
to college students who, it is hoped, 
have much better things to do. 

School mascots serve two pur-
poses; neither of which is intended 
to insult any culture. The first is 
the official mascot symbol : This is 
the picrure usually accompanying 
official university documents, and it 
is symbolic of the strength and dig-
ni ty of the school. 

Anyone who has seen UCSD's 
mascot knows there is a big differ-
ence between the version at basket-
ball games and the version on our 
transcripts. The official mascot of 
UCSD is a powerful-looking, steel-
stomached Greek god wielding a 
trident. This image is supposed to 
elicit feelings of pride, strength, 
ability and other virtues only 
expressible through mermen 
clutching large pole arms. Ir pur-
ports nothing to insult ancient 
Greek culrure, but instead praises 
one of its characters. 

In turn, SDSU's official mascot 
does the same thing. It is not 
Monty Montezuma, per se, but a 
muscular warrior with shield and 
ornate headdress - another sym-
bol of pride and strength. 

A school doesn't pick a mascot 
to disgrace its school or to insult 
anyone. It is an uphill battle to 
maintain or create school pride -
no university would choose a mas-
COt that causes everyone to hate the 
school. A school's mascot is nevcr 
supposed to be a disgrace, but a 

symbol of pride and achievement. 
How often do UCLA alumni 

refer to themselves as Bruins? 
Nearly all the time. Even the 
Banana Slugs of UC Santa Cruz. 
have great pride in their mascot. 
Sweaters that state "100 percent 
real slug" are a valued commodity. 
In fact, UC Santa Cruz's mascot 
was the sea lion until the students 
voted it down in favor of the slugs. 
When school mascots ruin school 
spirit, schools eliminate the mas-
cots and promptly replace them. 

The second purpose a mascot 
serves - and a more controversial 
issue - is to be a presence at ath-
letit events. Those mascots, admit-
tedly, are generally more likely to 
be caricatures. They often attempt 
to draw attention to themselves by 
using a vast array of comic devices. 
Our own athletic mascot is defi-
nitely less awe-inspiring than the 
official depiction. . 

However, it is not a sleight to a 
culture to depict a caricarure of that 
culture. Athletic events have to 
instill a sense of fun and excite-
ment, not grim pride or Marine 
Corps loyalty. In fact, to caricarure 
figures is to lend them status and 
respect. Even if someone such as a 
politician faces strong opposition, a 
caricature is an admittal that the 
person matters and deserves atten-
tion. 

In the same sense, the caricature 
of Monty Montezuma is not an 
insul t to the Aztecs, but an 
acknowledgment that it represents 
a culture that deserves recognition. 
Obviously, those who picked the 
Aztec as a mascot thought the 
Aztec was an admirable figure. 

In response to all this contro-

SoCal: 
San Fran is no match for 
the glory of La La Land 
Continued from pace 4 

The divergence of attitudes in 
NoCal and SoCal residents is 
reflected in, oddly enough, the 
mass transit systems of San 
Francisco and Los Angeles. San 
Francisco's BART flails its arms 
across dozens of miles of Bay 
area turf, and die-hard NoCal 
residents wallow in praise for its 
silver trains. Yet BART is quite 
useless in practical terms - if 
you're a Bay Point resident who 
wants to get across to San 
Francisco within a couple of 
hours, then you're fine , but for-
gt:t about trying to get around 

S~n francisco on BART. Its pal-
try handful of stops barely slinks 
through a slice of 'Frisco neigh-
borhoods. 

Los Angeles, interestingly 
enough, makes no pretense about 
its Metro, which has demonstrat-
ed staggering inefficiency even in 
its infancy. It goes prac tically 
nowhere, and it costs millions. Yet 
nobody puts on airs to the con-
trary. And everybody knows that 
if you're going to be hanging 
around Crenshaw Boulevard, the 
safest place to be is in an 
(undoubted)y) empty Metro train. 

Southern California doesn't 
deceive when it comes to free-
ways, either - we like them big, 
and we like a lot of them. Why 
pretend otherwise? 

While on the subject of infra-
structure and public works, one 
cannot ignore the importance of 
the water debate when it comes 
to Northern-Southern 
California re lations. Yes, 
Southern California makes no 
qualms about slurping up the 
contents of the north's crystalline 
falls and lakes. Our long and hal-

OPINION 5 

lowed tradition of water thievery 
began with the early 20th ce nru-
ry maverick William 
Mulholland's plans to bring more 
water to Los Angeles County. 
We're so good at it, we even gar 
those big 01' square states to 
channel us their ambrosial drink, 
too. However, we owe you an 
apology, without a doubt, for 
what Mulholland started: His 
water-guzzling aqueducts pulled 
the resource into the Valley, an 
action with1>ut which its weed-
like growth would never have 
been possible. Yeah, we're sorry 
about it too. 

AJI this is not to say that 
NoCal is si mply a complete 
waste of - divcrtible natural 
resources. Its most noteworthy 
contribution to the annals of his-
tory is doubtlessly the term 
"hella" (form before vowels: 
"helluv") . It's unfortunate that an 
audacious, insolent musical 
group from, of flU places, Orange 
County should dare to appropri-
ate and disseminate the use of 
this venerable term in one of its 
songs, but a rant on Orange 
County deserves separate space. 

Statewide news pundits will 
doubtlessly recall the ecession 
debate that raged a few years ago 
- the proposition to create sepa-
rate orthern and Southern 
Californias. The idea is com-
mendable, and it is certainly a 
step in the right direction. Tho e 
proposing it, unforrunately, drew 
the borders all wrong: Their 
vision of "Southern" California 
included San Francisco and 
Sacramento! 

But do not lose faith, loyal 
SoCal'ers. Perhaps that glory day 
will come when we can gaze over 
a liberated southern state, one 
having been freed from its unbe-
comingly snobby northern 
cousin . In the meantime , 
NoCal'ers, quit your gripmg and 
stay in your half of the state.

Editor: 
The April 15 issue of The 

UCSD GUllrdian included an 
opinion article penned by Chris 
Taylor ("The Koala is not UCSD's 
on ly 'racist' publication") that 
highlighted, in a general way, 
what he perceives as "racism" 
coming froin Voz Fronteriza. At 
Voz, we appreciate the publicity 
and find comfort in the fact that 
students are actually picking up 
our humble newspaper. 

At the same time, though, I 
have to make it perfecdy clear 
that Voz Fronuriza is not a wimp 
publication. We will not be made 
to feel guilty because we have 
caused Taylor (or anyone else, for 
that matter) psychological dis-
comfort. At Voz Fronttriza, we 
have nothing to apologize for -
in fact, quite the opposite is true. 

Briefly, Taylor has a problem 
with Voz Fronuriza denouncing 
racism. He explains that Voz 
Fronttriza accuses others of 
racism while being racist our-
selves; that our racism springs 
from the use of words such as 
"Gringo" and "Gabacho"; that we 
attack "assimilated Chicanos" as 
"pigs" and "traitors"; thaf we 
attack only "Europeans of Anglo-
Saxon descent" as imperialists, 
and not Spaniards; and in case the

And good lord, why do SoC al

our insidious racism, Taylor 
includes that we advocate for the 
reacquisition of the entire 
Southwestern United States for 
Mexico. 

Taylor should be ashamed of 

tan - as they should. 
That's right, there are seasons 

up there. There's nothing like 
some rain and cold to make you 
appreciate the beautiful summers 
and springs. Sure, its tem perate 
down here, but big dea l. It's never 
really clear because of all the smog. 
Look toward the horizon: The k"

posed to be brown. 

"'hen it comes down to it, the 
ci ties of SoC al simply do not stack 
up. San Francisco is so diverse and 
filled with culture, it is often diffi -
cult to know what country you're 
in. Sacramento is bustling with 
California politics. 

As we all Icnow, San Diego is 
boring. LA. does have Hollywood, 
Santa Monica Boulevard and so 
forth. A case could be made for 
those constituting culture and divcr-
sity. On the other hand, a case could 
be made for those constituting the 
antithesis of culture and diversity. 

It cannot be denied that the 
entertainment center of the world is 
Hollywood, with its throngs of 
movie stars and musicians. Well, 
NorCal isn't hurrin' in that respect, 
either. There's a lime company up 
there called Lucas Films. In fact, 
George Lucas came up with the 
idea (or Imperial Walkers after 
looking at the giant cargo container 
cranes on the Oakland harbor. To 

himself. Doesn't he have anything 
better to do? The entire planer 
Earth has been plunged into 
imperialist violence, led by an 
illegitimate, corrupt, war-mon-
gering U.S. government, and he 
feels that Voz Fronttriza is the 
only thing around that deserves 
condemnation? Doesn't he 
understand that if he should ever 
reproduce, the future of his chil-
dren is being put at risk? 

Regardless of Taylor's skewed 
priorities, there is also his oppor-
tunist interpretation of historical 
and current realities. The truth is 
between the lines. 
Taylor is not upset with Voz 
because we use words such as 
"gringo" or "pigs." Taylor is upset 
because at Voz Fronteriza, we 
know history, and we tell it like it 
is without pulling any punches or 
beating around the "politically 
correct" bush. This is the real 
source of his uneasiness. 

This is true because anyone 
who picks up an issue of Voz can 
see immediately that our paper is 
about so much more than simpl is-
tic discussions about individual 
racisi terminology. Taylor 
attempts to liquidate the faCt that

Letters: 
Language of Voz calls 
attention to injustice 
Continued from page 6 
ist, anticolonialist, antifascist 
and , yes - anti racist publication. 
Voz Frontrriza is a student newspa-
per that is on the side of poor and 
oppressed people everywhere. 
Finally, Voz Fromerizo has been all 
of these things for over 26 years! 

So, I repeat, we have nothing to 
apologize for. Yet, in order to 
avoid the idea that I have side-
stepped Taylor 's criticisms, I can 
offer these rwo simple p~oposals . 

First, regarding the use of 
"offensive slurs" - when Taylor 
joins the fight against imperialism 
and for the liberation of oppressed 
people, we promise not to call him 
"Gringo" but instead call him 
"Com pancro." 

As for people who support 
imperialism, colonialism, fascism, 
etc. - we reserve the right to call 
them "gringos," "gabachos" and 
"pigs," or whatever else we can 
think of, because history demands 
that we do so. To simply ignore or 
censor ourselves in the face of so 
much injustice all around us, sim-
ply so as not to offend a few peo-
ple, would make liS part of that 
same injustice. A pig is a pig is a 
pig, regardless of whether they are 

Mascots: 
'Fighting Whites' mascot

Continued from page 5 
versy, a group of Native Americans 
at the University of Northern 
Colorado recently decided to 
attack the college system by creat-
ing an intramural basketball team 
of which the mascot was "The 
Fighting Wh ites. " This mascot 
depicted a middle-aged white man 
in a suit, an image used often in the 
1950s. 

The name became an instant 
favorite, especially among white stu-
dents. T-shirts depicting the mascot 
became popular. The entire political 
statement backfired, merely because 
students did not care. Potentially, this 
statement could have posed an offen-
sive message to white students. 
However, students opted to not 
make an issue out of it, and instead it

Second, Voz Fronttriza promis-

es not to take over the U.S. 
Southwest and give it back to 
Mexico - at least not before 
midterms, because we will be too 
busy studying. 

Concerning The Koala, the

times explained that it is a humor 
paper, and that people shouldn't 
take it so seriously. The Koala has 
printed some really messed-up 
things, included racist stuff, yet it 
was not the Voz that called for its 
funding to be cut. We know that if 
The Koala were to get its funding 
cut, the administration would then 
use that as a justification to shut 
down Voz Fronttriza. So in that 
sense, we agree - it really is about

ture docs not seem to mind. Why? A 
Fighting Irishman is a symbol of 
pride, not disgrace. More important-
ly, the Irish community docs not 
care - it's only a mascot, and it 
inspires spirit in the students. 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Perhaps Taylor should re-read 
the article he refers to in the win-
ter issue of Voz (an article that I 
did not write). By doing so, he 
would see that it is more a critique 
of that lack of unity and strength 
among Latinos on campus versus a 
negative criticism against The 
KOllla, because in the final analysis, 
that is really what we see as the 
main problem. 

Due to the lack of strength 
among campus-based Latino 
groups, The Koalll can print what-
ever it wants and not feel responsi-
ble for its own words and ideas. 
Voz Fro7luriza, on the other hand, 
is not about making people laugh, 
and we do accept responsibility for 
what we print. If anyone out there 
is up to it - especially Taylor -
we can organize a debate and real-
ly get our ideas out in the open. 

Finally, there is that reference 
made about a Voz issue published 
in 1995. Taylor obviously spent 
time researching his arguments 
before printing them in the 
Guardian. I suggesrhe spend his 
time more effectively and perhaps 
sign up for an ethnic studies class 
or rwo in order to find out what 
racism really is - then perhaps he 
can sum up the error of his ways 
for us. We will save a spot for him 
within the pages of Voz Fro7luriza .

Editor, Voz Fronteriza 

Some will argue that if a mascot 
offends a group of people, it's bet-
ter just to change it. This is an 
argument that would cause every 
school to constantly walk on 
eggshells. People will always be 
offended by something; if people 
backed off every time someone was 
offended, nothing would ever get 
done. Activist groups would cer-
tainly never get anything done. 
Their actions offend the majority 
of university students who actually 
take pride in their mascots. If this is 
the case, whose damaged pride 
takes priority? 

When anyone gives credibility 
to an issue that is not yet problem-
atic, they automatically make it 
problematic. To become insulted 
by a mascot is making a big deal 
about something that has a relative-
ly trivial meaning. In the end, it is 
really not a matter of insult, but 
rather the amount of time that peo-
ple are willing to spend searching 
for insults in unlikely places.

New Wave members drop 
complaint against Williams 
Complaint was discontinued because the A.S. elections 
manager's term would have ended later that day 
By TOM NEELEY 
Staff Writer 

Accusations by former New 
Wave slate members against 
Jessica Williams, the 2001-2002 
A.S. elections manager, were 
dropped during a brief A.S. judi-
cial board hearing May 3. 
Williams was able to finish the 
final hour of her term, which 
ended that da;1 at 4 p.m. 

Garo Bournoutain, former 
New Wave candidate for A.S. vice 
president finance, filed the com-
plaint on behalf of New Wave on 
April 12, claiming Williams had 
been biased against the sla~·e dur-
ing the campaign and election 
period. 

The slate chose to withdraw 
the complaint due to an apparent 
miscommunication between New 
Wave and the judicial board. Slate 
members thought Friday's session 
was a joint hearing where they 
could present both of their 
charges, one regarding Williams' 
alleged bias and the other regard-
ing the dismissal of New Wave 
candidate Jessica Oseguera. 

An objection was raised by the 
defense when Daniel Watts, the 
New Wave spokesman and for-
mer Earl Warren College sopho-
more senator candidate, attempt-
ed to include arguments regard-
ing the Oseguera disqualification. 
Watts is also a staff writer for the 
GUllrdilln. 

The objection was sustained 
because the judicial board was 
prepared only to hear arguments 
against Williams as outlined in 
the April 12 complaint. 

Watts attempted to continue, 
but decided with Bournoutain to 
withdraw the allegations against 
Williams.

The energetic dancers, fueled 
by the upbeat music and steady 
clapping from ·the audience, awed 

"We'll spare you the hour," 
Bournoutain said, addressing 
Williams and withdrawing the 
complaint. "Sorry about that. 
Sorry about wasting all your 
time. " 

The hearing lasted about 10 
minutes. 

With regard to the hearing 
and all the allegations presented, 
Kyle Biebesheimer, Williams' 
spokesman and the 2001-2002 
commissioner of student advoca-
cy, thought the complaint was 
without merit. 

'It was a 
miscommunication 
between me and a 
former member of 
our slate. It's just 
pOintless. It's not 

'going to accomplish 
anything.'

Former New Wave candidate (or 

A.S. vice president finance 

"The fact of the matter is that 
they weren't prepared today," 
Biebesheimer said . "I think that 
was clearly evident, and if Mr. 
Watts had actually thought about 
his argument a little further -
which to me was evident that he 
didn't do - but if he had, I'm 
certain he would even realize that 
charges against us were frivolous, 
and really in my opinion a fla-
grant abuse of the judicial 
process." 

The judicial board has yet to 

manv in attendance. 
Attendees could also enter a 

free raffle to win T-shirts and 
skateboards. 

Although not touted as a fund-
raiser, all funds raised through 
various booths - which sold 
items such as cotton candy, glow 
necklaces and Shiskaberries -
were donated to the San Diego 
Children's Center.

set a hearing date for the second 
charge, which may take place as 
early as this week. 

Bournoutain said afterward 
that the date of the hearing, 
which was set on Williams' last 
day in office, was a primary rea-
son for withdrawing the com-
plaint. 

"It was a miscommunication 
between me and a former mem-
ber of our slate. It's just pointless . 
It's just not going to accomplish 
anything," he said. 

In his opening statement, 
Watts briefly outlined the evi-
dence the slate planned to use in 
its case. As evidence to support its 
claim of Williams' alleged bias, 
Watts noted that Williams ran as 
a Students First candidate in the 
1999 A.S. Council elections. 

Williams said that slates form 
around elections 'and have no 
continuity between elections. 

"The name dissolves after the 
elections go away. Nothing car-
ries over from year to year," she 
said. 

"Alumni of Students First in 
no way put together slates that 
run after," Williams said . " In 
other words, people who run 
under Students First don't even 
have to get permission to use that 
name from the former people on 
the slate. I wasn't approached and 
any of the older members of 
Students First were not 
approached regardin'g the use of 
the Students First name." 

Watts also cited an article in 
Tilt Ntw Indicator ti tied "New 
Wave: So Much for Diversi ty," 
which was dis tributed during the 
e lections week in April. He said 
that Williams did not reprimand

By ALUSON FORD 
Contributing Writer 

Robert B. Livingston of the 
neurosciences deparunent at the 
UCSD School of Medicine died 
April 26 at UCSD's Thornton 
Hospital following a period of 
deteriorating health. He was 83. 

A public memorial is planned 
for Livingston and will take place at 
UCSD. 

Livingston was an important 
member of the UCSD community, 
scientifically and socially. 

Livingston was born in Boston 
on Oct. 19, 1918. He served in the 
Naval Reserves during World War 
II and was stationed as a physician 
in Okinawa when the United States 
dropped atomic bombs on Nagasaki 
and Hiroshima. Following his expe7 
rience in the war, Livingston 
worked in nuclear disarmament. 

Active in social organiutions 
and peace movements, Livingston 
had been a member of the 
International Physicians for the 
Prevention of Nuclear War. 

"He worked hard for the posi-
tion of social responsibility," said 
friend and colleague Theodore 
Bullock, professor emeritus of neu-

Wans also accused Williams 
of having a favorable bias for 
Action. New Wave alleged that 
bylaws were created to take down 
New Wave posters. 

Williams discounted the accu-
sations that she may have been 
biased during the election. 

"I think the allegations are 
false . I don't feel like there's any 
truth or any standing behjnd the 
allegations as me not being neu-
tral or disqualifying a candidate 
inappropriately. I think all of the 
steps were followed according to 
the bylaws," she said. · 

Regarding the pending allega-
tions for the Oseguera case, 
Williams said the judicial board is 
the wrollg venue for the charges. 
The judicial board, she said, is 
supposed to hear appeals after 
cases are decided by the elections 
committee. 

"Jessica [Oseguera] never filed 
a complaint with the elections 
committee regarding her disqual-
ification, and that would have 
been the appropriate channel to 
go through if they were going to ' 
complain about her disqualifica-
tion," Williams said. 

Bournoutain believes that 
New Wave's cllse will come to 
fruition in the next hearing. 

"I do believe that there were 
some biases during the election, 
and that's why we're further 
going to go along with our next 
hearing, which will probably be 
six days, and I believe that it will 
be much more clear after that 
hearing," he said. 

Biebesheimer does not believe 
the second set of charges will result 
in any adverse ruling. 

"There was just nothing there 
to their argument," he said. "I 
think the reason why Mr. Watts 
gave up was that he realized this 
halfway through his opening 
statements." 

Biebesheimer said that he want-
ed to put this behind him and set 
on with other business, 

"Let's just get on," he said.

must remain dedicated to the UCSD Principles of Community.

Students explore 
entreprenuerial 
possibilities 
Five college students 
open a speciality drink 
shop in San Diego 

By SARA HAHN 
Contributing Writer 

Most UCSD students are satisfied 
with a job that gives them a steady pay-
check and something to put on their 
resume. But imagine owning and manag-
ing your own business while still in col-
lege. 

This is a reality for five college stu-
dents, two of whom attend UCSD, who 
run and manage a Quickly Tea franchise. 
Quickly Tea sells a variety of drinks, such 
as boba, a Vietnamese specialty drink that 
mixes tapioca balls with juice and, of 
course, tea. 

"I didn't want to work for anybody. I 
wanted to employ, not to be employed," 
said Thurgood Marshall College senior 
Peter Yeh, who opened the store along 
with fellow UCSD student Minh Ngo. 

"At first, this started out as a hobby," 
Ngo said, also a Marshall senior. "Now 
we are growing up and treating it as busi-
ness. t ' 

What began as an idea in November 
2001 has turned into a fuli-f1edged busi-
ness, owned and operated by Yeh, Ngo 
and three other friends. 

"At first we jumped into this," Ngo 
said. "1 was sitting at the kitchen table, 
and Peter said, 'Want to start a boha 
shop?' and I said, 'Yeah!'" 

Their franchi se opened in Mira Mesa 
in February. Opening the store involved 
much time and money. Yeh, Ngo and 
their friends used earnings from summer 
jobs to purchase their own store from 
Quickly Tea. 

"All of it was bootstrap funding," Yeh 
said. "The money came from us. If I 
made money, it went straight to funding 
this place." 

Managing and running a store, how-
ever, has not been easy for Yeh and Ngo, 
who met each other their freshman year 
at UCSD. It has also been hard on their 
friends: Jason Cheng, a University of 
Southern California graduate; Brent 
Estrada, a student at UC Berkeley; and 
Ricky Chang, a high school friend of 
Yeh's. 

"This isn't stuff you pick up at 
UCSD," Yeh said. "It's really difficult 
because what you do at school doesn't 
correspond to what you do here. 
Managing time is tough - I work at the 
store 30 hours a week, and another 10 to 
15 hours writing business plan projec-
tions and studying demographics." 

Both students said the challenges of 
managing the franchise were unexpected . 

"I never knew starting a business 
would be so hard," said Ngo. "We stayed 
up until two or three in the morning 
working on the store." 

This included constructing the 
kitchen and tiling the entire store. Each 
snldent put in about I ()() hours per week 
at the outset, and the results were more 
than sore backs. 

"I never knew grout would stay on my 
hands," said Ngo. "They were red for 
days." 

At first, business was slow. 
"At the beginning, we had no cus-

tomers," Ngo said. "We were sitting 
around thinking, 'Man, this is an expen-
sive place to hang out!,n 

Business has grown exponentially 
since then. For the past two months, the 
store has been profitable. 

Yeh is now planning to extend his 
business venture. Quickly Tea is looking 
to open its second store in Los Angeles by

San Diego Humane Society finds 
animals a new home 

Local radio station helps host the adopt-a-thon 
By LINDSAY BOYD 
Associate Features Editor 

What do you get when you cross a dalmatian with a labrador 
retriever? You get Lazor, an eight-year-old mutt who is waiting for 
a loving owner at the San Diego Humane Society and the Society 
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Many animals just lik.: 
Lazor - dogs, cats, rabbits and even guinea-pigs - find them-
selves there each year. 

According to Gigi Bacon-Theberge, a representative for the 
Humane Society, about 3,500 animals are up for adoption each 
year, and this number is only a small part of San Diego's homeless 
pet population. While the Humane Society keeps animals until 
they are adopted, many shelters don 't have the time or space to 
find each animal a home. 

The San Diego Humane Society is a private, nonprofit facility. 
Most of the animals there are relinquished by their owners for 
various reasons, perhaps if they are moving, having a baby or are 
simply unable to take care of an animal. 

"My owner had to move," said Spike, a three-and-a-half-year-
old cocker spaniel. 

OK, the dogs don't actually talk, but each animal has a card 
outside his or her cage that tells their story. 

"My previous owner's neighbor was mean to me," said Harry, 
a rottweiler mix. 

A lot of pets have heart-wrenching stories. Through the 
Animal Cruelty Investigating Unit, the Humane Society rescues 
neglected and abused animals. 

Editors' Retra 

The ACIU pamphlet tells of "a ki tten stepped on by an 
angry neighbor," "a herd of 60 or mo re starving horses left to 
die, " and "a severe case [involving] a dog who was hit by a car." 
Instead of taking the dog to a vetererian, the owner attempted 
to treat the animal Ilimself. In his pai n, the dog licked his 
wounded legs to the bone. T he owner was arrested and chargeu 
with felony animal neglect. 

Many visitors to the Humane Society find it hard to walk 
around the place without fa ll ing in love wirh every anima l. 

Bacon-Theberge admi ts she is qui re fond of Lazor herself. 
"Consider the adult animals," Bacon-Theberge said, addin g 

that many people want a puppy or a kitten and often overlook 
some older pets that are already trai ned and just want to love 
someone. 

The Humane Society'S held its Per Adoptathon last weekend. 
Radio DJ Dave Mason of KOOL 95.7 housed himself in a cage for 
two days to promote the event. 

"It's kind of a symbolic gesture," Mason said. '' If the animals 
are caged up, why shouldn 't I be?" 

This is the second year KOOL 95.7 has been involved with the 
adoptathon . 

Bacon-Theberge said the Pet Adoptathon "is our biggest event 
of the year." However, there are fuzzy, furry, lovable animals at the 
Human Society all year long. Ranging from $64 to $94, there are 
always plenty of creatures from which to choose. 

You can find the San Diego Humane Society at 887 Sherman 
St. or check them out online at 1JlWWsdhllmnne.org 

Lazor, Spike and Harry arc waiting! 

The April 8 Guardian article titled "Hungry? Here's some food for thought," contained 
three errors regarding James Stephens, founder of Food for Thought. The article stated, "Years 
ago, when Stephens left Wall Street, he didn't do so voluntarily. He was fi red for stealing from 
the company he worked for. 'Being revealed as a ·thief among Wall Street attorneys was not as 
disturbing as knowing that my more experienced colleagues were getting away with it,' Stephens 
said. T here are also rumors that Stephens !las been arrested several times for drug abuse." 

There is no evidence to support these statements and the Guardian retracts them in ful l. 
We regret the errors.

Chris Pa<f'oeld/Guordm 
Mllkine Plllns: AS. President lenn Brown discusses next year's AS. Council events with new Vice 
President Internal Kevin Hsu at the first meeting that was run by the newly elected council. 

Boba: 
Quickly Tea thrives in San 
Diego 
Continued from page 11 

the beginning of June, and a third 
round of investors is considering 
opening a store in Riverside, Calif. 

"In all honesty," Yeh said, "we're 
not just looking to open one store: 
We're looking to expand." 

Though Quicldy Tea is decorat-
ed with large signs and T-shirts 
that say "Got boba?" both Yeh and 
Ngo said their ultimate goal is not 
selling boba. 

"The idea that will last forever 
is not boba," Ngo said. "It's tea. 
Tea is as good as soda and coffee, 
and even better." 

Creating a completely new 
store environment is one way that 
Yeh hopes to expand the Quickly 
Tea franchise . 

"Quickly uses really vibrant 
colors, but from now on, all our 
Quicklies will be completely dif-

ferent," he said. 
Straying from bright colors and 

opting for more mature, neutral 
colors is one way Yeh hopes to 
encourage his customers to come 
to Quickly to relax. Although 
Quickly Tea specializes in Asian 
food and drinks, Yeh hopes that 
Quickly Tea will assimilate into 
U.S. culture. 

"The Southern California mar-
ket for boba is very saturated," Yeh 
said. "If we can assimilate to U.S. 
culture, we're not limited to 
Southern California." 

Thao Troung, a senior at Mira 
Mesa High School and an employ-
ee at Quickly Tea, said that she 
loves working there. 

"It's the people that I work with 
- they're all so generous," she 
said. 

Dung Nguyen, another 
employee, agreed. 

"I like everyone here. It's a kick-
back job, and I've learned a lot, 
especially about customer service," 
Nguyen said. 

N go encourages srudents to go 

out on a limb and explore the pos-
sibilities. 

"At what point in your life do 
Vall have the least to lose? In col-
iege. This is one of the best times 
to get started. I think that students 
should just try it," Ngo said. 

Yeh, who will commit himself to 
Quickly Tea full time after gradua-
tion, said that even though he did 
not learn his entrepreneurial and 
business skills from UCSD, he still 
learned a lot from college. 

"We have a plan: A, Band C. 
That's what we learned in college. 
You can work really hard, but you 
have to have something to fall 
back on." 

For him, Quickly Tea has been 
"a free business school." 

"You can't put 3 price on this 
experience," Ngo said. "I like 
working with this company 
because we're all so young and 
ambitious. It's the ultimate adven-
ture. It's so worth it, not just 
because of a sense of pride in 
achieving something - you're 
just so amazed that you did this."

WHY RENT? BUY! 
HAs a 3rd year student at UCSD I wanted to live off campus and have a 
place that I could go home to and feel comfortable in. I gave Tobin a call 
after I saw his ad in the GUARDIAN and because I was familiar with him 
after living in the dorms. He not only helped me and my parents find a 
great place, he also cares about you, which is evident when he calls 
periodically to see how I am doing. He has been a tremendous help and I 
hope when I'm ready to buy property later in life I will have a real estate 
agent who has been as wonderful as Tobin! Calling Tobin is a no-brainer 
if you are looking for a place to live."

Baseball wins two of three from Aggies, staying in postseason hunt 
Tritons fighting Davis, San Bernardino for last two spots in CCAA postseason tournament 
By COURTNEY FIELD 
Staff Writer 

UCSD lrJveled to UC Davis last 
weekend to face the Aggies fn the 
Tritons' last four-game series of the 
regular season. 

In the first game of the series on 
Friday, the Tritons squeaked by the 
Aggies 6-5 . 

After UC Davis scored three runs 
in the bottom of the first inning, the 
Tritons battled back and scored twO 
in the top of the second. 

Triton first baseman Chad 
Addison drew a walk from Aggie 
pitcher Luke Steidlmayer in the top 
of the second inning. UCSD third 
baseman Keith Albrecht singled to 
left and second baseman Anthony 
Lococo hit a sacrifice Ay and scored 
Addison. Just after, right fielder 
David Hawk singled and drove in 
Albrecht on the play. 

UCSD struck again in the fifth. 
Lococo was hit by a pitch, while 
Triton shortstop Keith Hernandez 
singled to left field. With two outs, 
center fielder Matt Smith singled 
and scored Lococo. UCSD catcher 
Tyler Sullivan singled to center,

Continued from page 20 
over Hilo, UCSD headed into the 
match with Grand Canyon know-
ing that only the victor would con-
tinue to play next weekend . 

UCS D won twO previolls meet-
ings with Grand Canyon this sea-
son, both 5-4, and this match was 
to foll ow the same trend . 

The Tritons' progression was 
thrown into doubt after starting the 
match by losing two of the three 
opening doubles matches. 

Tadlock and Westerman strug-
gled mi ghtily against GC 's 
Nikita Bhardwaj and Robyn 

allowing Hernandez to score. 
Davis tied the !,'3me in the bottom 

of the seventh at five runs apieCe. 
Aggie first baseman Dennis Flippen 
tripled to left field and scored third 
baseman Matt Kamigawachi, who 
"had previously walked. Second base-
man Mark Wells singled and scored 
Flippen to even out the score. 

In the eighth, UCSD designat-
ed hitter Jeff Riddle singled. Brett 
Burton pinch-ran and scored what 
would be the eventual game-win-
ner when Albrecht came through in 
the clutch and smacked a double 
down the left-field line to put the 
Tritons on top 6-5 . 

For UCSD, James Sanders 
picked up the win in relief of starler 
Alexander Cremidan, throwiing over 
two shutout innings and improving 
to 2-1. 

Aggie starting pitcher 
Steidlmayer falls to 7 -4 with the loss. 

UC Davis battled back in the first 
game of Saturday'S doubleheader 
against UCSD to even out the series 
at one apiece. 

The Tritons wasted no time scor-
ing a couple of runs in the first two 
innings of the game. 

Jaeger, losing 3-8. Tadlock and 
Westerman's aggressive style was 
easily contained by the visitors' 
excellent ground strokes and flaw -
less lobs. 

O'Neil and Hung nearly took 
the No. 2 match, but with the 
score 6-7, the Triton duo had its 
serve broken. GCU's Christina 
Klokinis and Christine LiWanPo 
won 6-8. 

UCSD picked up its only dou-
bles points at No.3 when Jansen 
and Dao needed less than 30 min-
utes to shut out Karen Cervantez 
and Sarah Mitchell 8-0. 

The Tri tons went into the sin-
gles knowing they had to win fou r 
of the six matches to advance. Led 
by the play of Tadlock and Hung, 
they were able to pull it off. 

UCSD took a short- lived lead

pressure from outsid~ innucnces. 
Yet the ISU is going to let them 
return in three years. If the ISU's 
wrist slap were any lighter it 
might be confused with a gentle 
breeze. 

I think both Le Gougne and 
Gailhaguet ought to have 
received Iifet.ime bans from ice 
skating, the sport they made a 
mockery of. They both proved 
they don't have respect for the 

sport that they are supposed to 
represent with the most impor-
tant thing that exists in the sport-
i ng world : fairness. 

People view athletic events as 
an ideal world, a place where the 
principles of justice, fairness and 
equa lity are actually upheld as 
opposed to just spouted. When the 
integrity of the game is tampered 
with in front of millions of people 
- especially the Olympic Games 
- there should be the type of 
harsh punishment that will deter 
anyone else from doing something 
like that. 

Look at Pete Rose. In myopin-
ion, what Le Gougne did was far 
worse than Rose's transgression, 

In the first at-bats for UCSD, 
Sullivan doubled down the left-
field line and proceeded to score 
when Jeff Riddle ripped a shot to 
center field . Albrecht singled in the 
second and later scored an 
unearned run when Hawk singled 
through the left side. 

Though the Tritons began 
strongly, their two first-inning runs 
would be the only they mustered. 

UC Davis scored a run in the 
bottom of the fifth to pull within 
one, then blew the game wide open 
in the eighth inning, scoring seven 
runs on five hits. 

Aggie leadoff batter Robby Tulk 
singled to right field, then shortstop 
Ryan Coultas doubled to left field 
and precipitated Triton pitcher Raf 
Bergstrom's exit. 

Sanders carne in to pitch for the 
Tritons and intentionally walked UC 
Davis' Kamigawachi. Flippen then 
greeted Sanders with a ~ingle to sec-
ond base and scored T ulk. On a wild 
pitch, Flippen advanced to second 
and Coultas came into score. Wells 
then walked, while Aggie designated 
hitter Matt Blankenheim was hit by a 
pitch, thereby scoring Kamigawachi. 

after Westerman and Jansen picked 
up easy victories. Westerman 
improved to 24-0 in singles this 
season with a 6-0, 6-2 victory; 
Jansen went to 22-1 pic.king up a 6-
1,6-3 win. 

Jasmin Dao at No. I dropped 
her match 6-1, 6-4 after a late 
surge in the second set fell short. 
Down 1-4, Dao showed why she's 
the No. I player as a freshman, 
picking up the next three sets 
before having her serve broken in 
game nine, then c1ropping the 
lOth. 

With the team score tied 3-3, 
O'Neil and Klokinis battled it out 
at No. 2. O'Neil dropped the first 
set 3-6 before winning a hard-
fought second set with a 7-4 victo-
ry in the tiebreaker. O'Neil came 
out slow in the third and final set, 
dropping the first and last three 
games sandwiched by a futile 
comeback attempt. 

Now down 4-3, the Tritons 
needed to win the last two singles 
matches to advance. tn both meet-
ings this season, the outcome was 
decided by the final match, with 
Hung defeating Jaeger in a three-
set thriller on March 29 to give the 
Tritons the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association regular season 
title. 

Tadlock then defeated 
LiWanPo in another three-set 
match on May 4 in the CCAA tour-
nament semifinals. In the NCAA 
Regionals, however, the pressure 
was put on both players. 

Hung stepped up, first beating 
Jaeger in three sets. Hung won the 
first set after breakingJaeger's serve 
in the ninth set to give her the 6-4 
edge. 

However, everything seemed to 
blow up in the second set with 
Hung falling 0-6 and momentum 
totally on Jaeger's side. After a talk 
with assistant coach Emil Mihet, 
Hung regained energy in the third 
and final set, brealcing serve in the

Second baseman Dustin Soderman 
doubled to right center and drove in 
Wells and Flippen. Catcher Andrew 
Reisinger singled through the left 
side and scored Blankenheim At the 
top of the order again, T ulk flied out 
to center field on a sacrifice fly to 
score Soderman and give the final 
score of 8-2. 

UCSD's Raf Bergstrom got the 
loss and fell to 2-4 while Aggie Julio 
Marquez pitched a complete game 
and earned the victory to improve to 
5-5 on the season. 

In the second game of the dou-
bleheader, Triton ace John Beaven 
threw an eight-hit complete game in 
the seven-inning nightcap and struck 
out six Aggie batters to earn the win 
and improve to 7-4. After three 
innings of play, UCSD and UC 
Davis were tied at two runs apiece, 
however, Beaven silenced the Aggies 
after that. 

The Tritons proceeded to score a 
run in the top of the fourth and later 
added two in the fifth. 

In the top of the fourth, UCSD's 
catcher Matt Kennison doubled to 
left field and HaWK walked. 
Shortstop Hernandez singled 

through the left side and scored 
Kennison on the play. 

UCSD second baseman Matt 
Merrifield reached on a throwing 
error in the top of the fifth. Addison 
singled through the left side, and 
then Jeff Riddle reached on another 
Aggie error, scoring Merrifield. 
Brett Burton pinch-ran for Jeff 
Riddle. After UCSD's Smith 
reached on a fielder's choice, 
Albrecht singled to center field and 
scored Burton. 

Merrifield and Kennison led the 
Tritons with two hits, while 
Soderman, Tulk and Coultas again 
led the Aggies. 

UC Davis pitcher Greg Bruso 
took the 5-2 loss for the Aggit.'S and 
fell to 9-4 on the year. 

UCSD improves to 23-16 in the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association, while UC Davis' record 
is 24-15. Sunday's concluding game 
of the four-game series saw UCSD, 
UC Davis and Cal State University 
San Bernardino all eyeing the score-
board because the three are current-

spots in the C(:AA postseason tour-

and LiWanPo. As the only match 
still being played, both teams gath-
ered on adjacent courts while the 
stands filled to watch the matchup. 
Tadlock had dropped the first set 4-
6. In the second set TadlOCK broke 
serve in the first game and held on 
to a 6-4 victory. 

Going into the third set, all the 
pressure was on each team's lone 
seniors. The players exchanged 
breaks in the first two games, then 
proceeded to hold serve for the 
next four games. The two 
exchanged consecutive breaks again 
to go 4-4. Tadlock then broke again 
to go 5-4 and held for the 6-4 vic-
tory. 

"In the third set, Lyndsey 
changed her strategy a bit," 
LaPlante said. "She moved to the 
baseline and focused more on lobs 

will have to accept her rulings 
now. There will always be a ques-
tion of whether her rulings will be 
fair. 

Think of the athletes she's 
already damaged. Right now there 
is no world's-best in pair figure 
skating - both the Russian and 
Canadian couples were given gold 
medals. Sale and Pelletier 
announced their retirement, saying 
it wasn't due to the scandal, but, 
really, what else could it be? 

Despite Le Gougne's protests, 
she is clearly culpable. Her and 
Gailhaguet's character became 
clear when they both threatened to 
unveil heavy corruption in the 
world of ice skating ... as soon as 

letting her opponent make the mis-
takes." 

This move was evident when a 
great number of points in the sec-
ond set were 20-plus hit rallies with 
Tadlock rarely coming off her base-
line. 

Ironically, it was a quick charge 
of the net in the final point of the 
match that gave Tadlock the victo-
ry. 

"That's the reason why we do 
the 100-ball drill," a candid 
LaPlante said of Tadlock's change 
of strategy. " [LiWanPo] just 
choked."

Tritons pick up four crucial wins 
Softball scores 31 runs over weekend to end strong 
BY BRYCE WARWICK 
Staff Writer 

The Triton softball team swept 
a pair of doubleheaders at Sonoma 
State University and San 
Francisco State University this 
weekend, hopefully proving it 
deserves to be in the playoffs. 

The team can do nothing but 
wait until the playoff selections 
are announced May 6. 

After a strong performance at 
the Mountain Dew Classic in 
Bakersfield, Calif. from April 26 
to April 28, UCSD vaulted itself 
into the sixth position in the West 
Region . 

The top six teams will advance 
to the regional tournament May 
II to May 12 at the home field of 
the top-ranked team in the 
region. In order to be confident of 
their position, the Tritons needed 
four wins last weekend against 
two of the weaker sisters of the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association . 

The weekend began against 
Sonoma State with a strong pitch-
ing performance from Leea Harlan 
for UCSD. Harlan allowed five 
hits, no walks and one run in a 
complete game. Sonoma pitcher 
Megan Kaminaka allowed only 
four hits in seven innings, but the 
Tritons made their hits count and 
escaped with a 2-1 victoty. 

All the scoring occurred in the 
third inning when Samantha 
Hayes continued her hot hitting 
by driving in Jamie Hurst and 
Amy Mettee for the pair of runs 
UCSD needed for the victory. 
Sonoma State responded in the 
bottom half of the inning with a 
run of its own, but it would get no 
more and the Tritons took game 
one of the doubleheader. 

It was the only close game of 
the important weekend. UCSD's

cap, which yielded seven runs and 
14 hits for the Tritons. 

The top of the UCSD lineup 
did most of the damage. Leadoff 
hitter Mettee went 3-for-4 with a 
single, a double, a triple, four runs 
batted in and two runs scored. Kim 
Aggabao profited from hitting with 
Mettee on base by piclcing up two 
RBIs while going 3-for-3 . 

UCSD pitcher Christi 
Martinelli overpowered the 
Cossacks, notching eight more 
strikeouts to add to her CCAA-
leading total and surrendering 
only two hits. Martinelli picked 
up her 19th win with the complete 
game shutout, and the 7-0 deci-
sion brought the Tritons the 
sweep of the doubleheader. 

Heading to cellar-dwelling San 
Francisco State, UCSD asserted 
itself as the superior team, win-
ning 10-1 and 12-1. 

Russian ice skating pair that com-
mitted a grossly huge technical 
error over Canadian ice skating duo 
Jamie Sale and David Pelletier. The 
vote gave the Russian pair the gold 
medal, but when Le Gougne 
admitted to having been pressured 
"to vote a cen:ain way" by her ice 
sleating federation president, 
Didier Gailhaguet, Sale and 
Pelletier were also awarded gold 
medals. 

Six days ago, the International 
Sleating Union dispensed their 
sanctions for this obvious violation 
of ethics. 

The hit parade continued in 
the first game, with the Tritons 
getting 14 hits and scoring 10 
runs. Harlan pitched her second 
consecutive five-hitter, allowing 
only a solo home run to Gator 
catcher Rachel Darrow in the 
sixth inning. The mercy rule was 
enforced, ending the game after 
six innings. 

UCSD refused to show mercy 
in the second game, once again 
pounding the ball - this time for 
16 hits and 12 runs. Martinelli 
allowed only four hits and one run 
irrthe second game to win her 20th 
game, and the mercy rule was once 
again enforced afrer six innings. 

With their four wins, the 
Tritons accomplished their goal for 
the weekend and now wait to know 
if they will play in the West 
Regional, to be held May II to 
May 12 at UC Davis. 

The ruling against Le Gougne 
and Gailhaguet for violating the 
world's most prominent sporting 
event, for throwing away morals, 
ethics, responsibility and for 
putting the two pairs of ice sleaters 
through hell: a three-year suspen-
sion and exclusion from the 2006 
Olympics. That's it. 

Bullshit. Bullsbit. 
These people blatantly ignored 

the rules and picked a gold medal-
ist based not on the skaters' per-
formance but on some lobbying

Women's tennis slams into championships 
Tritons beat Hawaii-Hila, Grand Canyon to advance to NCAA finals in Kansas City 

.y COREY HOLMAN 
Staff Writer 

The streak is still alive: The UCSD women's tennis team 
advanced to the National Collegiate Athletic Association 
National Championships for the 16th consecutive season 
under head coach Liz LaPlante. 

The Tritons continued their impressive run by using a 
home-court advantage to first defeat University of Hawaii at 
Hilo 5-0 on Friday, then to take down Grand Canyon 
University 5-4 on Saturday afternoon in the NCAA Western 
Regional. 

The four-team tournament opened with Grand Canyon 
upsetting UC Davis before UCSD even took the court 
against Hilo. 

T he heavily favored Tritons did not disappoint the largest 
crowd of the season at the N orthview Tennis Facility on 
Friday afternoon, sweeping the visitors from Hawaii 5-0. 

In the opening doubles matches, the N o. 1 team of 
Lyndsey Tadlock and J ulie Westerman got an important win 
after breaking serve while tied 7-7, then holding for the 9-7 
victory. At No. 2 doubles the team of Ashley O'N eil and 
Mary Hung was frustrated earl y, dropping the first two games 
before pulling things together for an 8-4 victory. At No. 3 
doubles, Kristina Jansen and Jasmin Dao took an 8-5 victory 
to give the Tritons a 3-0 lead going into the singles matches. 

T he home squad wasted little time reaching five points, 
the number needed to create an unassailable lead and end the 
meeting. J ansen at No. 5 singles was on the winning end of a 
6-0, 6-4 decision, while Westerman took home a 6-2, 6-4 win 
at No 6 singles. T hough officially only a 5-0 victory, the 
other Tritons were leading or tied in three of the four 
remaining matches. '

U CSD falls short in Hawaii 
Men's tennis bounced by sixth-ranked HPU 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's tennis team 
fell a game short of the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Championships, losing to Hawaii 
Pacific University after beating 
University of Hawaii at Hilo. 

Last Friday, hundreds of miles 
away in Laie, H awaii, the UCSD 
men's tennis team duplicated its 
female counterparts' feat of 
blanking the University of 
Hawaii at Hilo 5-0 in the first 
round of the NCAA Division II 
tournament. 

The 20th-ranked Tritons had 
no trouble with the 11 - 11 
Vulcans, quickly winning five 
matches to render the other four 
meaningless. 

UCSD started the match off 
with a doubles sweep, then 
picked up singles victories from 
Bryan Swatt and Emil Novak to 
halt the rest of the singles match-
es and give the Tritons the quick 
victory. 

In No. 1 doubles action, 
Sameer Chopra and Swatt com-
bined for an 8-5 win over Hilo's 

team of Mario Mendonca and 
Raul Massa. Jeff Wilson and 
Everett Schroeter followed suit 
against Hilo's No. 2 team of Karl 
and Staffan Moritz, posting an 8-
2 victory. 

In No. 3 doubles action, 
UCSD's Michael Meyer and Dan 
Albrecht completed the doubles 
sweep with a hard-fought 9-8 (7-
4) battle over Richard Korneck 
and Paul Adams to give UCSD a 
3-0 advantage. 

Swatt then breezed through 
his match at No. 3 singles, post-
ing a 6-3, 6-0 thrashing of 
Korneck, and Nova beat Hilo's 
No. 6 Staffan Moritz 6-3, 6-4 to 
give the Tritons the shutout vic-
tory. 

The next day, UCSD faced a 
much tougher opponent in sixth-
ranked, 13 -2 Hawaii Pacific 
University. 

After HPU's No. 1 doubles 
team of Mikael Maata and Jan 
TripIer beat Chopra and Swatt 
8-6, UCSD's Wilson and 
Schroeter defeated Stefan 
Pampulov and Karl Sloss 8-2 to 
tie the match at 1-1 . 
Unfortunately, that would be 

the only victory for the Tritons, 
since the HPU team of Blaz 
Jurjec and Matey Pampulov 
beat Meyer and Albrecht at No. 
3 doubles. Then Jurjec, Matey 
Pampulov and Jan Tripier all 
posted straight-set singles victo-
ries for Hawaii Pacific to give 
the Sea Warriors the 5-1 victo-
ry. 

At No. 2, Jurjec advanced 
past Meyer 6-4, 6-4; Matey 
Pampulov beat Swatt 6-3 , 6-1; 
and Tripier posted a 6-2, 6-4 win 
over Wilson to give Hawaii 
Pacific the victory and halt the 
remaining singles matches. In 
the halted matches, Chopra was 
locked 3-3 in the third set 
agai{lst HPU's No. 1 Maata, 
while, at No.5, Wilson-Hayden 
was ahead of Stefan Pampulov 5-
2 after losing the first set. Novak 
was down 0-3 in the third set 
against Hawaii Pacific's Sloss at 
No.6 singles. 

UCSD finished its season 19-
4 overall, while Hawaii Pacific 
improves to 14-2 and advances to 
the 16-team NCAA National 
Championships in Kansas City 
from May 9 to May 12.

S ports is a world unto itself. On 
the field, court, rink 
or course there is 
nothing else than 
what is in between 
those two lines. 

Sports has its own laws; its own 
language, its own traditions and 
legends. There is something about 
sports that appeals to people across 
the world, a magical blend of com-
petition, dedication, skill and heart 
that infuses the minds of man and 
woman, young and old, rich and 
poor alike. 

Ever soaked in the atmosphere 
at a sold-out sporting event? 
Thousands of fans hanging on 
every hit, throw, jump, shot, catch 
- it is an awesome experience that 
few can match. At many colleges 
students have the opportunity to 
experience this environment 
almost weekly, while I don't see 
that tVer happening at UCSD 
unless we get a football team or 
move up to Division I. 

But this beautiful, secluded 
dimension from the "real" world 
can easily be shattered. The out-
side world sometimes crosses those 
boundary lines and infuses the sup-
posedly separate sacrosanct sport-
ing world, poisoning it with the 
tainting outside influences of 
money, politics, culture - robbing
