LOS ANGELES - The Los 
Angeles Police Department 
(LAPD) used rubber bullets 
and batons to quiet thousands 
of Bruin fans who took to the 
streets of Westwood on April 
3, after UCLA's victory in the 
NCAA basketball champion-
ships. Ponce made 15 arrests 
and more than 20 people had 
to be treated for minor injuries 
at the UCLA Medical Center. 
Several students who were hit 
by batons or bullets have since 
accused the LAPD of overre-
acting, saying that it did more 
to ignite conflict than to stop 
it. LAPD Commander Tim 
McBride said that the use of 
force was justified because 
the officers feared for their 
safety. McBride added that 
such actions were necessary to 
prevent further escalation of 
violence at the chamionship 
party.

further the cause of union recogni-

Associate News Editor 
In its ongoing quest for union 

recognition, UCSD's Association of 
Student Employees (ASE) yester-
day created a walkout committee to 
plan a two-day strike for an as yet 
unreleased date. 

"I'd say we have a mandate," 
said ASE Executive Board member 
Molly Rhodes who declined to say 

The student union and the ad-
ministration are currently embroiled 
in hearings held by the California 
Public Employment Relations Board

Associated Students Election Voter 
Thmout Could Break Records 
POLLS: Over 2,000 students 
cast their ballots duringthe 
first two days of voting 
By Jonn. Palmer 
Associate News Editor 

This year's Associated Students elections 
got off to a rousing start on Tuesday and 
Wednesday with over 2,300 students voting, 
nearly doubling last year's total of 1,239 
voters at the end of two days of polling. 

According to Elections Manager Mike 
Lindstrom, the "cleaner" atmosphere of this 
year's elections has prompted more students 
to vote. "We haven't had any problems," he 
said. "I think people [were) turned away [by 
charges of election rules violations]." 

Lindstrom said the only infractions that 
had arisen had been with college candidates 
accidentaUy placing posters in the wrong 
places. "It's really college specific," he said. 

Approximately 1,183 students registered 

to vote on Tuesday, the first day of the three-
day election. "We're havingagreatturnout," 
said Lindstrom. "I think a lot of it has to do 
with the referendums. I think the candidates 
as well are doing a great job getting out the 
vote." 

Warren senior Tony Yee said he voted 
this year because, "It's my responsibility. 
Actually, I just don't want to pay anymore 
fees." 

Muir senior Rajiv Mannath said he did not 
voted last year, but that this year he came out 
to vote for the fee referendum that would 
support a football team. "I just think school 
spirit would greatly benefit from that," he 
said. 

Lindstrom said that another 1,136 stu-
dents will have voted by the c!osing.of the 
polls on Wednesday. "I'm hoping that this is 
going to be our best year in history," he said. 
"My personal goal is 20 percent [of the stu-
dent body). I'd really like to see [a turnout of]

GSA Opposes 
A.S. Affordable 
Housing 
Program 
RESOwnON: Graduate students 
say that undergrads at Mesa 
Housing will displace graduates 
By HI ... 8cNCMon 
Staff Writer 

Claiming the Associated Students' low-cost hous-
ing program would displace graduate students, the 
Graduate Student Association (GSA) formally voiced 
its opposition to the plan in a resolution passed Tues-
day night. The resolution objects to the implementa-
tion of the program at the Mesa Apartments or any 
other housing designated for graduate students. 

The affordable housing program would place un-
dergraduate students at Mesa Apartments for trial 
period of one year. 

According to GSA Vice President Internal Paul 
Eykamp, the GSA was under the impression that 
Coast housing, a popular graduate-housing complex 
on La Jolla Shores Drive, would soon be shut down for 
renovation, causing a shortage of graduate housing. 

"In view of the fact that [the program] would 
displace graduate students, we didn't feel [Mesa hous-
ing] would be the appropriate place to put low-cost 
undergraduate housing," said Eykamp. 

However, when informed that the affordable-hous-
ing program was a one-year trial program and the 
Coast housing renovation was not scheduled to begin 
earlier than July 1, 1996, Eykamp said the GSA might 
compromise on the issue since the plan would not 
seem to displace graduate students under these cir-
cumstances. 

Eykamp said GSA members also opposed the pro-
posed placement of undergraduate students at South 
Mesa housing (units facing Regents Road and La Jolla 
Village Drive) rather than North Mesa housing (units 
facing Thornton Hospital) because it includes some of 
the most desirable graduate student apartments. 

"South Mesa is the Pepper Canyon or 10th floor of 
Tioga of graduate housing. If it's [approved], there 's 
going to be great screaming and gnashing of teeth," 
Eykamp said. 

According to Associate Director for Housing Ser-
vices Jana Black, members of the Affiliated Housing 
Advisory Committee, which oversees graduate-hous-
ing issues, share similar concerns with the GSA. 

"The issue was really that the housing is designated 
for graduate students and if there are graduate students 
[in need], it should be given to the graduate students," 
said Black.

Effects of Aging on Memory Discussed 
signed to educate students about 
homelessness and various methods 
to deal with the problem. 

For the last eight years, Hunter 
has worked for ECS, a San Diego-
based homeless charity with over 
30 programs around the county and 
a budget of $10.5 million. 

While Hunter acknowledged that 
there are many theories which blame 
homelessness on mental illness and 
substance abuse, he said the prob-
lem is largely economic. 

"The number of addicted people 
has not changed significantly in the 
past 20 years," Hunter said. "fl is a 
false analysis to assume that drug 
and alcohol addiction and mental 
illness causes homelessness. What 
causes homelessness is extreme pov-
erty." 

Hunter said that the main prob-
lem is lack of resources for the poor. 
In 1968, a person could rent a room 
for $.SO per night and the minimum 
wage wu $1.25 per hour. Three 
hours of work could obtain a week 
of shelter. Today, these low-cost 
housing options no longer exist. 

Comparable single-room oc:c:u-
paney hotels now cost $75 per week, 
while minimum wage is $4.25 per 

tor housing, in any 
part of the city. The people who 
receive the certificates are expected 
to contribute 30 percent of their in-
come toward rent, with the Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Devel-
opment covering the remainder. 

Participants in the project still 
receive medication and case man-
agement but are allowed to live on 
their rather than in an institution. 
Wood said ·that after two yean, 60 
percent ofthe participants were still 
living independently and were sat-
isfied with their living conditions. 
In Ilddition, this program is consid-
erably cheaper than institutionaliza-
tion, according to Hunter. 

The main contribution students 
can make to alleviate the problem of 
homelessness, Hunter said, is to vol-
unteer at one of the many San Diego 
charities that serve the homeless. 
Volunteers can provide homeless 
people with a social connection and 
a friend, which according to Hunter, 
has been proven to bring stability to 
people's lives. 

Hunter said the best way for stu-
dents to get involved is to contact 
the Volunteer Center at the United 
Way which can provide a list of 
agencies that need volunteers

HOUSING: 
ContInued .......... 1 
Barrett said he baa not yet received 
the GSA resolution, but that the 
IoW<Olt housing plan will continue. 

He added that if he receives the 
resolution, he will speak with the 
Affiliated and Undergraduate Hous-
ing Committeca, the A.S. and the 
vice chaacellor of business affairs, 
who overseea the housing commit-
tees, to see if a compromise can be 
reached. 

"Right now, [there are] Vlcan-
cies and we can't affordtbat. We're 
still going forward with the plan," 
said Barrett. 

Barrett also said that South Mesa 
hoUling wu chosen for the project 
because North Mesa housing has 
smaller units and, by code, cannot 
hold four students. 

A.S. President Carla Tesak, who 
helped bring the low-c:ost housing 
plan to fruition, said campus resi-
dences are for both graduates and 
undergraduates. 

She added that undergraduates 
have a greater need right now for 
housing. 

According to the" FslI t 994 Oc-
cupancy Report" prepared by 
Barrett, 40 percent of undergradu-
ates are housed on campus com-
pared to 64 percent of graduates. 

"To deny the undergraduate 
population 2.5 percent of housing is 
to be completely blind to the needs 
of the ... students," said Tesak . 

. Eykamp said the GSA has yet to 
decide whether it is in favor of the 
basic concept of housing under-
graduates in graduate housing.

city Council'. Project .. 
Equal-Opportunlty Crock 

San Diego City Council ha delayed the first payment - $800,000 
- for a $140 million expansion of the SIn Diego Convention Center. 
This initial payment WII supposed to cover the cost of trsining the 
minority contractors which the city had hired for the expansion project. 
Councilwoman Judy McCarty called for the delay, asking why the city 
needs to train these contractors - and rightfully so. They had been 
bired under an equal-opportunity program, but they Iaclr. some basic 
contracting skills such II cost accounting and bidding, and therefore 
require a 100week construction-management training course. 

According to Melissa Piscitello, a spokeswoman for the joint . 
venture which the city hired to design and build the center's 
expansion, "We feel that this team of professionals will carry out the 
equal opportunity program with results that reach national attention." 

Team of professionals? "Professionals" would be licensed 
contractors who do not require a course which teaches them the 
elements they should already know. 

"Only $7,sOO of that [$800,000] is specifically for the construc-
tion-management training program," Piscitello added. 

ONY 57,sOO? This is money which the city is wasting on training 
unqualified contractors whom it should not have hired in the first 
place, minority or not. "Equal opportunity" should not mean hiring any 
minority simply because he is a minority. There are qualified minority 
contractors in this town. And had the City Council bothered to do its 
homework, it would realized this and not had to spend an extrs 57,500. 

The city hll now backed itself into a ridiculous comer. Because 
these contractors are minorities, the city somehow seems to assume 
that it would be unethical to fire them and get real professionals who 
actually know what they are doing. However, it is highly unlikely 
that no other San Diego minority contrsctors are available. Further-
more, how can "contractors" who need to be trained to do plan 
reading and estimating rightfully be called contractors? 

According to The San Diego Union-Tribune, "The City Council 
WII poised to authorize an initial $6.8 million on the project when 
McCarty produced a letter .describing a 10-week 'construction 
management training course' for minority contractors, to be funded 
by the council's action." But with the city's incredibly poor plan-
ning, not even Mayor Susan Golding and Councilman Harry Mathis 
had enough details about the project to know how the $6.8 million 
will be spent. So, City Manager Jack McGrory apologized and 
provided these missing details last Tuesday. 

The situation is an alarming sign that San Diego's leaders know 
little about the projects they are leading - even large ones like the 
expansion of the Convention Center. In addition, the council 's 
ineptitude gives extra bad press to affirmative-action and equal 
opportunity programs: Those who want to abolish affirmative action 
will do doubt eat up this latest morsel of irresponsibility and lout is 
an example of how such progrsms are failing. 

In the words of Councilwoman McCarty, "This is a crock. This is 
$800,000 worth of crock. " 

Border Should Be Patrolled 
For Human HlIClIts Abu ... 

Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) Commissioner 
Doris Meissner arrived in San Diego lilt week, lauding the efforts of 
Operation Gatekeeper, the new border policy which has managed to 
arrest 25 percent more illegal immigrants than at this time last year. 

AIIo lilt week, Newt Gingrich approved a bill which calls for a 
tbreo-lier fence to be built along the California-Mexico border, with 
Border Patrol apntsltanding watc:b at every 100 y .... One 
wonders wby Meiaaer and Gingrich are 10 ready to praia and 
expand Operation Gatekeeper when over 1,000 complaints of abuse 
have been brought against INS agenta. 

According to the new 43-page report published by Human Rights 
Watch/Americas (HRW/A), 91 complaints bad been filed against the 
San Diego Border Patrol in 1993 alone. Although the INS is 
estabIilhinla "Cilian's Advisory Panel" to ensure adequate

CHANNEL DROWNING 
COMMENTARY: Talk shows cater to the loser in all of us, exposing 
the worst qualities of living in the age of modem media 

JENNY 

LInn 
Jaundiced! 

The other day, I caught one of 
those cheesy talk shows that 
comes on after "Good Moming 
something-or-other." Notice no 
one ever admits to watching one 
of these shows on

tell you, "I was

whining for a glass of water or his idiotic significant 
other who allows this manipulation to continue. Al-
though it was mystifying, I must say it was enter-
taining. 

I am always amazed by the inces-
sant arguing between families and 
friends, which takes place on these 
talk shows. For example, Thelma will 
drone on about what a bastard her hus-
band Jim is, while Jim sits right next 
to her, smiling blandly. Thelma seems 
like a victimized innocent, until Jim 
says something like, "Ask her about 
the time she slept with my father" and 
they both get all bent out of shape and

THANK GOD UCSD HAS ITS OWN EINSTEIN IN HEARN 
EdItor: 

I was much humbled by Greg 
Hearn's reference to the almighty 
Albert Einstein ("Referendum 
Commentary Distorts Facts, "~ril 
6), an historical figure with whom 
he obviously compares himself. It 
is marvelous to know that UCSD 
remains .. bastion of intellectual su-
premacy because of the mental tal-
ents of its fraternity and sorority 
members. 

Hearn, an obvious lover of logic, 
concludes that only three UCSD stu-
dents could possibly be opposed to 
a $30 per quarter fee to support in-
tercollegiate sports. Anyone, he 
says, who dislikes the idea of hav-
ing a football team at UCSD appar-
ently has no life. 

After reading that brilliant state-
ment, I realized that I am inferior to 
the likes of Hearn, nay, to anyone 
belonging to a Greek club. I clearly 
have no life, nor do any of my 
friends. Good God, to think I could 
have spent my Sundays for the past 
five years watching the triumphs of 
the Triton football team, while in-
stead I wasted my days worrying 
about my own petty pursuits. 

In addition to being a true "no-
lifer, " I clearly lack the mental acu-
ity of the mighty Hearn. He implies 
that students at UCSD all want bet-
ter sports teams to fill their empty, 
meaningless days. If they need 
sports so badly, why didn't these 
poor suckers go to UC Berkeley, 
UCLA or even the lowly campuses 
at Davis or Santa Barbara? It seems 
that an academically great school 

with a low sporting profile is what 
these VCSD saps wanted. But then 
again, I'm no Einstein.

EdItor: 

I am writing to express my dis-
content with the Guardian for not 
representing my viewpoints in Nina 
Boughton and Heather McKea's 
news article ("Fee Hikes Up for 
\\)Ie Next Week," April 6, 1995). A 
careful reading of the article reveala 
that the platforms of two of the can-
didates running for vice president of 
finance, Edmondo Robinson and, 
Nelson Sun, were profiled to a cer-
tain degree. While naming me as 
one of the candidates for the same 
office, the GIIIU'dUm failed to rec-
ognize my platform. I feel that the 
513.50 activity fee ought to be allo-
cated fairly to programs which are 
beneficial to the entire UCSD stu-
dent body. The Guardiall should 
have made every effort to accurately 
and equally represent the candi-
dates' platforms.

cent of the trees were dead or dy-
ing, that was not the data the vari-
oua planning committees used in the 
decision-making process. In fact, 
many of the trees are stressed and 
therefore more suscePb'ble to beetle 
attack than less-stressed trees. Re-
placing these trees now will help 
avoid the spread of the eucalyptus 
beetle throughout the grove. 

Much has been said about the 
lack of student or faculty input in 
the whole planning process. Where 
were these vociferous students and 
faculty when the project was being 
planned? They weren't in the Cam-
puslCommunity Planning Commit-
tee (ClCPC) meetings when Library 

Walk was discussed. I know be-
cause I was there as the Graduate 
Student Association (GSA) repre-
sentstive to that committee. I would 
like to add that I was not elected 
GSA representative because I would 
rubber stamp the administration's 
idea, no matter what earl Lenox 
thinks ("Administration is Avoiding 
Student Input on 'Walk, '" April 3, 
1995). If I remember correctly, the 
A.S. did not send a representative 
to the ClCPC at that time. In the 
years during which I served, the 
A.S. could not find students inter-
ested in serving on the C/CPC, de-
spite the committee's important role 
of advising the chancellor on plan-
ning and development. An AS. rep-
resentative attended meetings for 
part of one year, but a replacement 
for this representative wu never ap-
pointed. 

I was also the GSA representa-
tive on the equivalent committee for 
the Faculty Senate, Committee for 
Campus and Community Environ-
ment (CCCE), and I can Sly that 
despite what Professor Jorge Hirsch 
says, there wu faculty input on the 
planning of the walk. I WII briefly 
the GSA representative on the Park 
Committee until I wu replaced by 
a biologist/ecologist. The Park 
Committee enthusiastically protects 
the park and grove areas on cam-
pus. I am confident that it would not 
recommend any tree replacement if 
it were not in the ecological best in-
terest of the campus. 

People seem to think the univer-
sity is spending too much on a "side-

walk" during an economically dif-
ficult time. Even this ugument is 
clouded with misinformation. The 
fact is that some of the money must 
be spent to make Classroom Build-
ing One accessible for the 4,000 stu-
dents who will be using it between 
classes. We could have put off the 
rest of the project, but when it was 
finally completed, people would 
have complained that the walk 
looked piecemeal and aesthetically 
uncoordinated. 

Finally, conatruc:tion began dur-
ing finals week and spring break 
because the administration wanted 
to minimize the number of people 
who would be inconvenienced by 
the work blocking access to Central 
Library and Price Center, not be-
cause it wanted to avoid organized 
student protest. 

These opinions ue my own and 
do not represent my employers, the 
administration or any other orga-
nization. But frankly, if Carl Lenox, 
Wendy McNeill, Jorge Hirsch and 
anybody else who objects to Li-
brary Walk really wants to make a 
difference, they should start attend-
ing the planning committees and 
live their input in the planning 
stages, instead of trying to stop 
projects at the last minute because 
they just found out about ,them. As 
for new students, they havo to trust 
that the previous students who were 
involved with the planning of li-
brary Walk conaidered all tbe facts 
and made ~ best decisions at the

Hey, on college campuses those "in the know" are the ones who rule. 
And it's not just about being smart in the classroom, it's about being wise 
with your wallet as well. So if you want a great low price on a collect call, 
just dial 1800-CALL-ATI. It always costs less than 1-800-COLLEcr. Always.

There are lots of tricky things for you to learn at college, but here's 
something that's easy: KNOW THE CODE, and save the person on the 
other end some serious money. You'll be glad you did. ALWAYS COSTS LESS 

THAN 1-800-COLLECT:

A.S.: Free candy, 
condoms offered to 
students who vote 
ContInued ........... 1 

Some campus organizations are 
offering their members incentives 
to vote as well. Patrons of Islands 
restaurant wearing Greek letters 
can redeem their ballot stubs for a 
free order of french fries. 

Lindstrom said he was eacour-
aged by the amount of candy poll-
sters have given away to the voters. 

"We're running out of the lolli-
pops and condoms," he said. "I see 
people walking around with lolli-
pops. That's good, I think, [be-
cause it means that) people voted." 

UNION: 
Movement gaining 
momentum at ues 
ContInued ......... 1 
student employees will refrain 
from a strike until all "good-faitb 
efforts to negotiate with the UCSD 
administration have failed ... 

The ASE will launch a petition 
drive this week to gamer 500 sig-
natures of student employees who 
pledge not to cross the picket line. 
Executive Board members are 
hopeful the majority of student 
employees will observe tbe walk-
out. 

"Our goal isn't to disrupt tbe 
lives of undergraduates," said 

THURSDAY 

The UCSD Guardian 

Rhodes. "We bope that they would 
support our efforts. .. aad realize that 
improving our working conditio. 
will improve their leaming condi-
tions. " 

UCSD Manager of Labor Rela-
tions Mike Melman declined to com-
ment about the pending walkout, 
before last night's vote. 

According to UCSD (adminis-
tration lawyer) Sharon Grodin, stu-
dent employees are in a awkward 
situation because they are both stu-
dents and workers directly within 
the "academic enterprise ... 

"The university has a responsi-
bility to its students and to the state 
that is different from any other em-
ployer I can think of," said Grodin It 
a February PERB hearing. "PERB 

has the obligation to deal with those 
concerns concurrently and in their 
interrelationship. " 

Because of this unique relation-
ship, the administration said that 
offering student employees collec-
tive bargaining power would be det-
rimental to the university. "They 
claim that we're not workers be-
cause we're students," said Rhodes. 

With PERB's ruling expected to 
come at the end of April, Executive 
Board members believe the ASE 
has a good chance of gaining union 
recognition, despite the team of five 
lawyers hired by the administration. 

"I am confident that the judge 
will rule in our favor," Rhodes said. 

According to the ASE, the ad-
ministration could be spending as 

Thursday, April 13, 1995 

much as $S,OOO a day in legal fees 
as it bas enlisted the law firm Corbett 
and Cane to prepare and present its 
CISC. 

Similar student-union move-
ments have sprung up throughout 
the UC system. Unions at Berkeley 
and Santa Cruz have held strikes to 
gamer support for union recogni-
tion, while unions at Los Angeles 
and Santa Barban have formed 
walkout committees toexplore simi-
lar strikes. 

Several campuses outside of the 
UC system have already granted 
recognition to student unions, in-
cluding the Universities of Massa-
chusetts, Wisconsin, Florida and 
Kansas and the entire State Univer-
sity system of New York.

SPORTS ROUND-UP 
Men 's lacrosse 

The Tritons slipped to UC Santa II.,., iN, on Sunay. 
A devastating fourtb-quarter per-

formance wu not enough to bring 
a morale-boosting victory to the 
UCSD men's lacrosse team against 
UCSB last Sunday. 

"We didn't ever have the ball in 
the first three quarters, so we 
couldn't score," Triton James 
Kappler said. 

Having allowed its visiting op-
ponents to stretch out a 9-1 lead by 
the end of the third quarter, a dis-
jointed Triton team was sparked to 
life early in the fourth by a Brent 
Hilsabeck goal. 

Following the score, 'he UCSD 
offense was unstoppable, notching 

Water Skiing 
For the UCSD water ski team, 

things just keep getting better and 
better. Case in point: On AprilS, the 
Triton skiers battled foes at the UC 
Berkeley tourney, finishing a solid 
fourth place among IS teams. 

And on April to, UCSD was at 
it again, improving on its previous 
performance by grabbing third in a 
1S-team Cal Poly SLO tourney near 
Bakersfield. 

In Berkeley, senior Bill Birk led 
the way for the Tritons, sneaking up 
on the field to take his first ovenll 
championship with a strong effort 
- ninth in slalom, third in trick and 
sixth in the men's jump. 

" Allhough we have seen ovenll 
championships by former UCSD 
male skiers and current women's 

INDY: 'Little AI' 
is king of the road 
Continued from pac. 13 
to plague many of the favorites on 
Sunday. Paul Tracy forced a restart 
of the race by leaving the line too 
early. And on lap 17, after being 
passed by Gil de Ferran, Tncy tried 
to overtake him in turn three. In-
stead, his car clipped the rear wheels 
of Ferran, sending both men's ve-
hicles'spinning, . 

As leading favorites dropped by 
the wayside, AI Unser Jr. pulled 
ahead to a comfortable five-second . 
margin that stretched into his sixth 
first-place finish at Long Beach. It 
ended a disappointing season for 
Team Penske, whose name is syn-
on)'tlK*l with winning and whose 
first three I'8CC5 this ICISOn yielded 
less .............. performances.

five unanswered goals in the next 
three minutes. Despite four scores 
from Kappler, another from 
Hilsabeck and solitary scores from 
Brad Cook and Dave Pogrel, UCSB 
was able to cling on for a 10-8 win. 

"Our defense and offense just 
couldn't control the ball" said 
UGSD's Dave Pakter. Indeed, the 
absence of Pakter from the Tritons 
line-up - courtesy of a badly bro-
ken wrist - left the Tritons short 
on firepower. 

"Finally we turned it on in the 
fourth quarter, but by then it was too 
late," Pakter said.

skiers, none were in [these) condi-
tions," Head Coach Bill 
Schneiderwind said. 

Also aiding the Tritons were Jes-
sica Waggenseil (fifth place over-
all), ~bby D' Amato (29th in sla-
lom) and Doug Jeffrey (16th in 
trick). 

At the Bakersfield tourney, it 
was UCSD'sAlilOn Walmsley who 
stole the show. The senior standout 
Clptured the women '5 ovenll cham-
pionship with a fourth in the slalom, 
first in the trick and 13th in the jump 
event. 

The Tritons will take the Easter 
weekend off, giving them two 
weeks to prepare for the nexl tour-
ney in Mission Bay on April 22-23.

Nevertbeleu, UCSD shot a de-

Jeremy Byrd's 78 was not

"Gentlemen, start your enginesl" 
Thus begins the 1995 Toyota 

Grand Prix at Long Beach, where 
28 men vie to be the first driver to 
circle a l.S9-mile course lOS times 
in expensive, carbon-fiber rolling 
darts, running at two miles per gal-
lon - aU in excess of 190 mph. 

From the overwhelming influ-
ence that equipment has on victory, 
one might be tempted to ask: Is this 
a real sport? Certainly, the spread 
in ages of the participants indicate 
that auto racing is far more forgiv-
ing of antediluvian participants than 
any other sporting event to memory: 
Bryan Herta, the rookie in the Tar-
get/Scotch Video R9S1 Ford 
Cosworth, is 24 aDd the geritol gen-
eration wu repreaented by the leg-
endary 47-year-old Emerson

But ask any racing fans (and 
there were more than 9,000 in Long 
Beach) and they'll teIl you in no un-
certain terms: Racing is the ultimate

The Panthers had the Triton 
starting pitcher Lisa Gil on the 
ropes early, teeing off for four hits 
and three runs in the first inning 
of game one. Gil quickly settled 
in, though, allowing just five more 
hits in the remaining five innings.

sport. 
As far as costs are concerned, 

they're right. Merely leasing a 
championship car like AI Unser's 
Penske Mercedes can run in excess 
of half a million doIlars a year. Sup-
port staff cuily exceeds $S million 
a year. Auto racing appears to be a 
sport of fiscal excess and an event 
whose fans appear very eager to fi-
nance. General admission to tbe 
event was $29, witb grandstand 
seats selling for $35. 

Just what does a $29 ticket to the 
1995 Toyota Grand Prix at Long 
Beach buy? More than anything 
else, an overwhelming volume of

The second game appeared 
equally bleak for the Tritons in the 
early going. Once again, Chapman 
rock'n 'rolled in tbe opening inning 
to the tune of three runs. Starting 
pitcher Shannon Mounger was 
able to contain the damage to four 
runs in the first two innings. She 
then stiffened and allowed just 
three more hits in the game. 

Meanwhile, the Triton offense 
sprang to life. In the third inning, 
UCSD cut the Panther lead in half. 
Gil came tbrough witb a big-time 
triple to drive in April Williams 

and make the score 
4-1. Nora Stephany 
then promptly 
smacked a single to 
bring Gil home. 

In the fiftb in-
ning, Gil and 
Stepbany struck 
again. Gil reached 
first on a error and 
was eventualIy 
driven in by 
Stephany, to nar-
row the Chapman 
lead to one, 4-3. 

However, the 
Triton bats fell si-
lent as the Panthers 
mustered a sixth 
inning rally to 
bump the margin 
back to a final 
score of 5-3.

Ode To Joe 
In my brief but illustrious 
ca~r as a sports fan, I've 
witnessed the retirement of 
some great athletes - heroes 
who have raised the standards 
of their respective sports. 
People like George Brett, 
Robin Yount, Lawrence Taylor, 
Larry Bird and Magic Johnson 
thrilled us with their superior 
talents, and professional sports 
suffered with the loss of each. 

However, the departure of 
these icons pales in compari-
son to the retirement of the 
world 's greatest athlete, 
hailing from a Northern 
California city that has a 
bridge of gold. 

I'm referring, of course, to 
Joe. 

There is no need to be more 
specific. Just by incanting that 
immortal title - "Joe" -
everybody knows who I'm 
talking about. II 's the god-like 
Joe Montana, the greatest 
quarterback ever. 

SI"UNG: The UCSD 
sluggers have won six 
straight and eight of 10 
BySunR .... ml 
Staff Writer 

Eight out of to. Six wins in a 
row. Five straight road victories. All 
these statistics point to one conclu-

sion: The UCSD 
baseball team (16-9) 
is on a roll. 

Mter a sluggish 
start at the begin-

.,.,lIHIII'IIJ ning of the season, 
the Tritons have 
come out on the 
winning side of 
games in the last 

two weeks - losing only to rival 
Cal Lutheran recently. 

Yesterday, the UCSD sluggers 
flexed their muscle, clobbering Cal 
Baptist College at Triton Stadium by 
a score of 13-2. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Rumor has it that Number 
16 is finally hanging up his 
jock strap after a stellar t 5-
year ca~r. It 's a day I hoped 
would never come. 

It almost doesn't seem 
possible that his career is 
coming to an end. For a 
decade-and-a-half, the 38-year-
old's presence on the field has 
been a given. Whether leading 
the Niners or the Chiefs, we all 
knew that the legend would be 
out there, and he would be 
good. 

Junior pitcher Ryan "Ryno" 
Ward (54) started the game for the 
Tritons and notched his fifth victory 
of the season, tying fellow southpaw 
Steve Height (5-3) for the team lead 
in wins. Ward pitched seven innings, 
striking out seven and blowing 
Lancer hitters away with his 
fastball . 

CIIuck NMen/~ 
AI Del Favero huatles back to first base efter drIvI ... In Chris MIy.e to make the score 2-0. 

"I felt real strong today," Ward 
said. "I didn 't throw much on Sat-
urday, so I felt rested. We need a 
good streak like this to get into the 
playoffs." 

UCSD jumped out to a lead in 
the bottom of the third inning, as 
Chris Miyake came up to bat and 
lined the second pitch over the left-
field wall for his second homer of 
the year. 

"It was a fastball, thigh-high and 
on the inside part of the plate," 
Miyake said. "We were relaxed and 

h.aving fun. We're starting to get the 
clutch hits." 

The Tritons then came through 
with some timely two-out hits to in-
crease their lead. UCSO put five 
more runs on the board in the bot-
tom of the sixth, increasing its lead 
to 6-0. 

Miyake started things off with From his game-winning TO 
pass to Dwight Clark at the 
expense of the Dallas Cow-
boys in Super Bowl XVI to his 
vintage comeback against the 
Cincinnati Bengals in Super 
Bowl XXIII, Joe's larger-than-
life heroics have stunned the 
sports world, earning him the 
admiration of sports fans and 
the respect of his rivals. For 
centuries to come, bards shall 
sing about Joe and his 
legendary Niners. 

Panthers Sink Claws Into UCSD 

When you get right down to 
it, there are few, if any, athletes 
who can compare to him, 
regardless of the sport. Some 
might say Jordan, with his 
three-and-counting champion-
ships, might be as good on the 
basketball court as Montana 
was on the gridiron. 

However, when you add to 
that equation the pounding that 
Joe sustained during his 

DOUBLED-UP: Tritons endure two defeats vs_ second-ranked Chapman 
By Dan Kraft 
Associate Sports Editor 

After a rocky start to its season, the UCSD soft-
ball team has begun to play up to its potential. Un-
fortunately, the Tritons have been forced to mea-

sure that potential against such 
tough competition as Division I 
Loyola Marymount at the Triton 
classic last weekend and, most re-
cently, against the second-ranked 
team in Division III, Chapman 
University. 

The Panthers shelled the pre-
dominantly youthful UCSD lineup 
in the opening game of a double-

header, 6-0. However, the Tritons demonstrated their 
toughness with a gritty second-game performance 
before falling to Chapman, 5-3. Despite the defeats, 
UCSD's improvement was apparent. tenure, it's surprising that he 

was still standing at the end of

No need to argue with the 
Cranberries' charisma 

From thernoment she rosefrom 
the back of the stage, awash in 
purple light and black satin, 
Dolores O'Riordan, lead singer of 
the Cranberries, mesmerized the 
crowd with her soaring voice and 
contagious energy. The Irish four-
some played to a sold-out crowd 
Saturday at the RIMAC arena . 

O'Riordan and "the boys" 
wasted little energy in showy the-
atrics- the focus and heart of this 
hour-and-a-half concert was their 
music. O'Riordan's slinky black 
satin dress, covered by a flowing 
red robe, stood out amidst the sim-
plicity of the unadorned stage and 

the blue jeans of her fellow band 
members. 

Opening the evening with the 
haunting melodiesof"Pretty" from 
their album Everybody Else is 
Doing it, So Why Can 't We?, the 
show got off to a rather sluggish 
start . 

Sadly, the acoosticsofthearena 
also did little to enhance 
O'Riordan's rich voice, paling in 
comparison. to the clarity of the 
band's CDs. 

Theaudience, however, did not 
leave completely umatisfied. The 
band's energized version of "Lin-
ger" instantly excited the crowd. 

Guitarist Noel Hogan's intricate 
playing skillfully complimented 
O'Riordan's Irish lilt. 

O'Riordan's endearing stage 
presence kept the crowd enrap-
tured for the rest of the concert as 
pop songs seamlessly gave way to 
political ballads and personal testi-
monies. O'Riordan swept the 
crowd into her own exuberance by 
continually urging them to sing 
along with her and letting them 
know that they were "better than 
the crowd in LA"

The UCSD Guardian 

Jefferson in Paris 
Film takes critical look at president 

By DI .... Reynold. 
Guardian Reporter 

Jefferson in Paris is a lavish film 
which chronicles Thomas Jefferson's 
year.i as the American ambassador to 
France (1784-1789). From casting to 
costumes, the Merchant Ivory pro-
duction team (Howards End, The Re-
mains of the Day) spares no 
effort both in ~ting Paris 
on the eve of the French Revo-
lution and detailing the pri-
vate life and 10vesofJefferson. 

Jefferson (Nick Nolte) ar-
", rives in Paris in 1784,accom-

panied by his eldest daughter 
Patsy (Gwyneth Paltrow) and 
one of his slaves, James Hemings 
(Seth Gillian). Both James and his 
sister Sally (Thandie Newton) are part 
of the estate Jefferson inherited from 
his father-in-law and they are the half-
siblingsofJefferson's wife, who died 
in 1782. 

Since slavery is illegal in France, 
James demands, and receives, wages 

for his work while in France, with the 
understanding that his status will 
change once he is back in Virginia. 

Shortly after his arrival, Jefferson 
falls in love with Maria Cosway 
(Greta Scacchi), the wife of an En-
glish painter. Maria is prepared to 
divorce her husband and marry 

Jefferson. However, 
Jefferson had promised his 
wife hewould never remarry 
after her dealh. 

While Maria is staying 
in London, Sally arrives in 
Paris with Jefferson's 
younger daughter, Polly 
(Estelle Eonnet). Not yet 15 

year.i old, Sally finds il diffICUlt to 
ask for the wages her brother has 
reoeived.Consequendy,shebecomes 
Jefferson's lover. 

While declaring his love for 
Maria, he remains blind to his pr0b-
lematic relationship with Sally. His 
moral indignation wilh the sensuaI-
il." of Parisian life does not mesh with

Jefferson in Paris provides a look

weakness. The Merchanl Ivory pro-

duction team has again produced a 
visually stuMi ng and superbly crafted 
film that refuses 10 simplify its heroes 
or lhe complexity of their lives.
