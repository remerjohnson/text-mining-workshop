A preliminary report of potential 
changes to the Sun God Festival 
announced that guest tickets would 
be eliminated for the upcoming 
event in May 2014, according to the 
A.S. Concerts and Events Sun God 
Task Force. 

The no-guest policy comes after the 
2013 Sun God Festival saw a 46-per-
cent rise in drug and alcohol-relat-
ed detox visits, a 129-percent rise in 
medical transports, a 55-percent rise 
in student conduct violations and a 
54-percent rise in arrests compared to 
the 2012 festival.

“Sun God 2014 almost didn’t hap-
pen, and Sun God 2015 is far, far from 
guaranteed,” A.S. Concerts and Events 
Festivals Director Andrea Hsueh said.

HULLABALOO 2013

The annual Hullabaloo festival, organized by A.S. Concerts and Events, took place on Friday, Nov. 15 as part of  this weekend’s Founders’ Day Celebration. 
Students gathered in Town Square and Matthews Quad for the free event, which featured food trucks, amusement rides and musical performances.

The A.S. Transportation Task Force will 
use the results to propose a fee referendum.

A.S. Council passed a resolution stating its support of a transportation fee referendum last Wednesday, which would help address 
nearly 12 months of debate over how to resolve a 
series of transportation changes proposed by UCSD 
Transportation Services. The choice to battle trans-
portation issues with a referendum comes as a result 
of responses to the “We Decide, Let’s Ride” campaign 
survey from earlier this quarter. 

The language of the referendum has yet to be 
finalized and approved by A.S. Council. The earliest a 
referendum could be presented to the student body is 
some time during Winter Quarter 2014.

There were a total of 2,621 respondents to the 
survey — roughly 36 percent live on campus, 27 per-
cent use the UCSD City Shuttles to get to campus and 
smaller percentages use other means.

The options listed on the survey included con-
verting some “S” parking spots into more expensive 
“Commuter S” spots, a $117-per-quarter, user-based 
fee, a $25 to $45 student-based fee to partially cover 
expenses or a $45 to $60 student-based fee to fully 
cover expenses.

“More than 60 percent marked either support 
or strongly support a fee referendum and so that

▶ Typhoon Haiyan: UCSD student 
organizations Kaibigang Pilipin@ and 
the Pan-Asian Staff Association have 
established various fundraisers to aid 
the victims of Typhoon Haiyan. 

Kaibigang Pilipin@ collected 
canned food and clothing donations 
on Library Walk on Nov. 13, set up a 
donation bin for money and canned 
food in the UCSD Cross-Cultural 
Center and planned a Typhoon 
Relief Benefit Dance for Nov. 16 at 
Porter’s Pub. 

Tickets for the benefit sold at eight 
dollars presale and $10 at the door. 

Over 250 people attended Kaibigang 
Pilipin@’s benefit.

The Pan-Asian Staff Association 
has also been collecting items for 
donation. They suggested clothing, 
blankets, towels, flashlights, gloves, 
masks, infant formula and nonperish-
able food for donations.

The association will donate 
its items at its 8th annual Diversity 
Luncheon on Nov. 18.

▶ White House Info Event: 
UCSD’s San Diego Supercomputer 
Center’s projects from the Predictive 

Analytics Center of Excellence and 
Center for Large-scale Data Systems 
Research were recognized during 
the “Data to Knowledge to Action: 
Building New Partnerships” event 
held by the Obama Administration’s 
Networking and Information 
Technology R&D program.

Two SDSC projects, Benchmarking 
of Big Data and Sustainable 
Communities, were highlighted dur-
ing the meeting. 

The performance of Benchmarking 
of Big Data has been immensely 
improved in the last 20 years. Recently, 

the researchers have been investi-
gating different strategies for big 
data generation.

The Sustainable Communities 
project works on developing infra-
structure that can reduce power con-
sumption while improving quality 
of life and economic development in 
downtown San Diego.

“It is indeed gratifying to see that 
some of our best and brightest are 
being recognized at such a high level 
for their work in big data applications,” 
SDSC Director Michael Norman said 
to UCSD News.

was sort of our go-ahead to continue 
with the referendum,” Revelle College 
Senator and Transportation Task Force 
member Soren Nelson said. “We’re 
confident that we have a lot of support 
behind the referendum.”

Over 60 percent marked disagree 
or strongly disagree on a user-based 
fee — where students would pay an 
out-of-pocket price if they chose to 
ride shuttles within the Bus Zone — 
while responses for increased parking 
permit prices were more evenly dis-
tributed between strongly agree and 
strongly disagree.

Another question proposed reduc-
ing the frequency of Campus Loop 
buses in order to “preserve coverage to 
off-campus student housing.” Over 75 

percent of respondents marked agree 
or strongly agree.

However, in a letter to Vice 
Chancellor Matthews, this proposal 
was not discussed. The ideas sug-
gested in the letter were the insti-
tuting of the referendum and a 
Student Transportation Advisory 
Committee that would have over-
sight of these funds.

“In addition to the student advisory 
committee, we are looking at form-
ing a transportation advisory board 
that, in essence, would become a more 
effective governing body than what we 
have now,” ASUCSD Moves Executive 
Director Kyle Heiskala said. “There is 
a dramatic need for a change; [admin-
istration] has expressed it, and the 
people who run transportation have 
discussed the ineffectiveness of the 

current committee.”
In moving forward with these pro-

posals, there are many governing bod-
ies that must approve of them before 
they are finalized in a vote, which A.S. 
President and Transportation Task 
Force member Andy Buselt said the 
task force hopes will be no later than 
Winter Quarter 2014.

“A referendum requires Council to 
approve it, GSA to approve it and all 
the administrative bodies to approve 
it, but first and foremost, we want to 
be transparent that referendum is the 
direction that we want to go,” Buselt 
said. “The general takeaway is that 
overall, folks were very receptive to 
having a referendum.”

LIGHTS & SIRENS Lights and Sirens is compiled from the Police Crime Log at police.ucsd.edu.

According to the report, non-stu-
dent guests account for over one-third 
of those admitted to detox facilities. 
Guest tickets, which sold for $65, 
accounted for 3,000 of the roughly 
20,000 people who attended Sun God 
in 2013.

“The 3,000 [non-student guests] 
at the festival last year represented a 
disproportionate amount of risks,” A.S. 
Associate Vice President of Concerts 
and Events Sarah Harley said.  We 
believe the elimination [of guest tick-
ets] will help to reduce these risks.”

The Sun God Task Force was estab-
lished in September to respond to the 

rise in health and safety problems in 
2013. The task force’s report offers 
ways to reduce heavy drinking and 
student detainments at the event.

“We find ourselves in a position 
where we have exhausted all of our 
resources in terms of police, staffing, 
security, and medical assistance, and 
we’re at the point where we’re reach-
ing unsustainable [levels],” Hsueh said. 
“We’re taking the first step so some-
thing doesn’t happen so that we have 
a Sun God.”

Other suggestions included in the 
report are altering the wristbands to 
make them more difficult to remove 
and checking student IDs upon entry.

“All of our decisions were made 

with health and safety as the biggest 
concern,” A.S. President Andy Buselt 
said. “It’s going to enable us to have a 
festival that’s more student-centered 
than ever before.”

The task force also plans to make 
use of a campuswide survey, emailed 
out by ASCE, to gauge students’ priori-
ties with regard to the event.

“We’re going to rely a lot on stu-
dent input,” Hsueh said. “We want to 
be able to collaborate and work more 
closely with our peers […] to discuss 
the issues at hand and what we can do 
to solve them.”

QUICK  TAKES ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES HAVE STIRRED CONTROVERSY AS A POPULAR, EASY-ACCESS PRODUCT THAT ALLOWS USERS TO “VAPE” NICOTINE MIXED WITH FLAVOR LIQUID, RATHER THAN SMOKE TRADITIONAL TOBACCO.

In light of the California State Universities’ recent cutbacks within ethnic studies programs, the question of whether ethnic 
studies is still a viable and integral part of a 

well-rounded higher education resurfaces. 
In addition to a now-limited selection of 

classes, major curricula changes and 
professor resignations, a 2012 USA 

Today article explained that UC 
Santa Cruz and UC Berkeley have 

removed or reduced funding in 
their ethnic studies programs, 

respectively. 
The paring back of ethnic 

studies programs is a 
worrying nationwide 
trend, suggesting that 

far too many universities 
undervalue the discipline 
and the subject as a whole, 
as well as ignoring racism 
and discrimination still 
prevalent in society. 

Ethnic studies, the inter-
disciplinary study of race and 
racialized people in a larger 

societal context, is particularly focused on how 
the treatment of historically marginalized people 
affects social dynamics of the United States. In 
California public universities in particular, diver-
sity among the student population is key to a 
successful institution. Ethnic studies programs are 
crucial to combating intolerance and discrimina-
tory cultural practices and should not be elimi-

nated or scaled down in public universities.
The common argument against ethnic stud-

ies states that the courses draw color lines where 
none existed before. However, this argument is 
based on the rather naive assumption that racism 
no longer exists or is much improved from the 
1960s, when those studies emerged. A 2013 LA 
Times article explained that the “the initial intent 
of the [CSU system’s] programs was to increase 
the numbers of students and professors of color 
and expand historical perspectives.” In the face 
of our increasingly diverse and pluralistic society, 
opponents argue that the major teaches skills that 
are no longer applicable. 

Yet despite these claims of an equitable society, 
a June 2013 Guardian UK article reported “the gap 
between black and white unemployment in the U.S. 
is roughly the same as it was in 1963.” The num-
bers suggest that issues regarding race still linger 
in the United States. Additionally, uproar caused 
by the recent verdict of the Trayvon Martin case 
reveals that racism is still an important issue in 
American society. Given these notable issues, ethnic 
studies courses are still applicable and necessary 
in universities. Moreover, the National Education 
Association addressed this concern directly, finding 
that “rather than being divisive, ethnic studies helps 
students to bridge differences that already exist in 
experiences and perspectives.”

Although the UC system, along with many 
other public institutions of higher educa-
tion, stresses the importance of diversity, the 
actions of a few students reveal that there is 
still racism and intolerance on campuses. After

E-cigarette users get their nicotine fix with-
out the other toxins found in tobacco, but there 
hasn’t been any research to investigate what 
vaporizing these chemicals will do in the long 
run. What started out as a healthier alternative 
to traditional cigarettes is quickly becoming an 
accepted aid in kicking the habit altogether, but 
without a thorough evaluation of the extended 
use of electronic cigarettes, they cannot be pro-
moted as a reliable means towards complete ces-
sation from tobacco.

Short-term tests done by Chair of the 
European Respiratory Society Control 
Committee Christina Gratziou revealed that use 
of the e-cigarettes led to an “immediate rise in 
airway resistance” which can affect users’ ability 
to breathe through their lungs. Longer trials are 
required to know whether these negative effects 
become permanent after consistent use.

Aside from the risk caused by liquid nico-
tine, quality control issues in the manufacturing 
of e-cigarettes can prove dangerous as well. In 
a study done by the Public Library of Science, 
amounts of metals, silicate beads and nanopar-
ticles were found in the vapor that users inhaled, 
and sometimes, these levels were even higher 
than in tobacco. As an unregulated product, pro-
duction standards differ in each device, introduc-
ing varying amounts of these toxins.

Smokers quit so they can avoid the dangers 
associated with the activity, but e-cigarettes may 
simply replace the dangers of smoking with an 
entirely new set of risks. Comprehensive trials 
are needed to measure whether electronic ciga-
rettes will damage users’ health just like tobacco 
does. Until further testing is done, smokers 
should not depend on e-cigarettes as a healthy 
alternative.

Electronic Cigarettes Are a Healthier 
and Successful Smoking Alternative

Government Regulations Are Necessary 
To Protect E-Cigarette Users’ Health

Until Long-Term Effects Are Clear, 
Vaping Cannot Be Labeled As Safe

Every month in the United States, cigarette 
smoking is responsible for ending over 35,000 
lives. It is not only a high cause of death, but a 
highly preventable one. When it comes down to it, 
though, most smokers just can’t quit. A potential 
lifesaver, e-cigarettes, provides a new, less harmful 
alternative to traditional cigarettes. 

Though not marketed as a smoking cessation 
aid, e-cigarettes have proved effective in reducing 
and eliminating cigarette smoking habits. University 
of Catania professor Riccardo Polosa monitored the 
smoking habits of 40 “hardcore” cigarette smokers 
after giving them e-cigarettes. In six months, the 
participants cut their cigarette consumption in half, 
and almost a quarter of them switched to e-cigs and 
quit cigarettes altogether. 

Packed with toxins and carcinogens, cigarettes 
have been linked with lung cancer, while e-cigarettes 
contain only trace amounts of potentially harm-
ful chemicals. Moreover, the leading chemical of 
health concern in the e-cigarette, propylene glycol, 
is a main ingredient in an openly marketed smok-
ing cessation product, NICORETTE QuickMist. 
William Godshall of Smokefree Pennsylvania ranks 
e-cigs as less than a two out of 100 on a harm scale 
where nicotine gum and lozenges are ranked num-
ber one and smoking 100.

Cigarettes are filled with tobacco smoke, but 
e-cigs are vapor-filled, allowing users to choose 
from a variety of flavors and control their nicotine 
consumption. Users’ cravings are satisfied, and the 
most glaring risks of regular cigarettes — as well 
as the collateral damage caused by secondhand 
tobacco smoke — are eliminated

With more reward for less risk, e-cigarettes are 
a great choice for smokers who are interested in 
prolonging their lives but not necessarily inter-
ested in reducing their nicotine-induced pleasure.

Regardless of how beneficial electronic ciga-
rettes may or may not be, the government needs 
to keep a tighter control on the sale of electronic 
cigarettes. The production of e-cigarettes is still 
unregulated, and the chance of youth picking up 
this habit is a high risk. 

The side effects of e-cigarettes are still rela-
tively unknown, while its components are com-
pletely unregulated. Electronic cigarettes contain 
traces of nicotine and various flavored liquids, 
called “e-juice,” that sellers often brew themselves. 
According to a CBS 8 San Diego article written 
on Nov. 11, many sellers actually brew their own 
e-juice instead of buying from well-known suppli-
ers. Because of the unregulated nature of the indus-
try, anyone can go online to order or sell e-cigarette 
components and ingredients without being subject 
to any health regulations or standards.

Those fighting against the mass production of 
electronic cigarettes, including the Food and Drug 
Administration, the American Cancer Society 
and the Center for Tobacco-Free Kids argue that 
e-cigarettes could be a gateway for younger people 
to become nicotine addicts. In a 2012 survey by 
the Center for Disease Control, 2.8 percent of high 
schoolers said they had tried e-cigarettes — a 195 
percent increase from the previous year. Because 
e-cigarettes are marketed as less harmful than actual 
cigarettes, the possibility of a younger generation 
picking up the habit is a risk.

To the nicotine addict trying to quit or the 
curious adolescent, e-cigarettes appear to be an 
appealing option. But until the government sets 
regulations, the e-cigarette industry continues to act 
as a creative free-for-all — and meanwhile, users are 
subject to health risks they may not be aware of. At 
the end of the day, the government is accountable to 
ensure the safety of e-cigarette users.

 Culture Shock
California public universities must support faltering 

ethnic studies programs to combat racial intolerance and 
foster cultural understanding.

See ETHNIC STUDIES, page 5

As a research university committed to community engagement and public 
service, UCSD has a mission to help 
the underserved. There is a well-
documented body of research show-
ing that there are social factors like 
education, environment and income 
that predict worse health outcomes 
and higher incidence of chronic dis-
ease. Student-run free clinics — like 
the four operated by UCSD — help 
reduce social health disparities and 
further the community’s commit-
ment to public service.

There are social factors related 
to higher incidence of chronic dis-
ease among a population, which 
are called social determinants of 
health. These factors are beyond 
genetic predisposition and indi-
vidual behavior — they are about 
the contexts that determine health 
outcomes. Two of the most common 
social determinants of health are 
lower income and education levels. 
Free clinics target these underserved 
populations and offer healthcare 
services where there is need. Greater 
access to primary care will lead to 
greater preventive action and less 
chronic disease.

However, some worry that 
student-run clinics offer lower-qual-
ity care. Medical students are not 
licensed physicians, yet they run the 
clinics. This leads people to worry 
that student-run clinics offer lower-
quality care and perpetuate the 
stereotype that low-income families 
should get lower quality care or be 
“practice” for aspiring doctors. But 
while medical students are given a 
lot of autonomy to run the clinics, 
they are still overseen by licensed 
physicians who make official diag-
noses and file prescriptions. 

Student autonomy in free clin-
ics is an important part of the 
educational process. Empowering 
students with the freedom to run a 
clinic will motivate them to put in 
their best effort. Medical students 
have enough supervision to learn 
from their mistakes, which offers 
students real-world experience early 
on in their education. This experi-
ence will help them become better 
practitioners and may also inspire 
them to work with the underserved 
in the future.

Student-run clinics are also more 
sustainable than other options. They 
are funded by medical schools, 
as opposed to relying on funding 
from religious institutions, as many 
other free-clinics in the past have. 
Student-run clinics also have a 
constant supply of eager volunteers. 
UCSD’s clinic system has an inter-
view process for undergraduate vol-
unteers, who are primarily involved 
in clerical work. It’s an ideal set-up 
for medical schools, who get the 
opportunity to provide a real-world 
educational experience for their 
students and work to reduce health 
disparities on a societal level.  

While not perfect, student-run 
free clinics are a sustainable solution 
to social health disparities. Greater 
access to primary care through free 
clinics will reduce health disparities 
for underserved communities and 
offer them awareness about lifestyle 
changes like greater nutrition intake, 
tobacco cessation and having a more 
active lifestyle that will decrease the 
prevalence of chronic disease.

SOLVE FOR X By Philip Jia LETTER  TO  THE  EDITOR

UCLA’s “Asians in the Library” 
YouTube video or UCSD’s very 
own “Compton Cookout,” the 
Universities of California learned 
from their mistake and imple-
mented a mandatory ethnic stud-
ies graduation requirement with 
the effort to teach students how 
to combat racism. These actions 
helped foster a better community 
on these campuses. 

While the UC system’s com-
mitment to diversity and equal 
representation in the classroom are 
the first steps to combating rac-
ism, the 2011 National Education 
Association’s research review on 
the “Academic and Social Value 

of Ethnic Studies” explained that 
just simply having an ethnically or 
racially diverse population has very 
little effect on students’ attitudes 
towards difference “in contrast with 
curricula that teach directly about 
racism,” which does. Diversity class-
es are far more effective at bridging 
the cultural divide compared to 
mere racial quotas.  

The same review reported “that 
participation in diversity experi-
ences is ‘significantly and positively 
related to cognitive development’” 
because differing views and experi-
ences forces students to think in dif-
ferent and perhaps more productive 
ways. If higher education’s purpose 
is to provide and cultivate the next 
leaders and innovators of America, 

students attending these universities 
need to be able to not only think on 
more complex levels but be tolerant 
and accepting of those who are dif-
ferent — two issues that ethnic stud-
ies courses tackle.

As long as diversity still exists 
in this country, knowledge of the 
ways to have intelligent, productive 
conversations among those with 
different ethnic histories are vital 
to producing a nation that is toler-
ant and non-discriminatory. Public 
universities should not cut back on 
ethnic studies programs in order to 
help combat intolerance on a larger 
social level.

Diverse Student Bodies Need to Learn Culture in Class Settings

Dear Editor, 
San Diego law enforcement 

agencies established a facial recog-
nition system using 133 Galaxy tab-
lets and smartphones since January 
2013. The sheriff ’s department and 
San Diego Police Department have 
the most devices, with 64 and 27 
devices, respectively. 

Sheriff ’s Commander David 
Myers said the tablets and smart-
phones are used when an officer 
thinks someone is lying about who 
they are: “I’m sure there’s a lot of 
people out there who have lied to 
me, and because nothing came up 
in the system, I had to let them go. 
Justice was not served.”

“Photographs are neutral — you 
can’t say it’s racist when a camera 
is taking a neutral picture of some-
one,” said Rob Halverson, a Chula 
Vista officer. 

The most active single user is a 
San Diego State University police 
officer who used his device 224 
times from January to Oct. 30, 2013 
— in a totally neutral manner, of 
course!

New York’s controversial stop-
and-frisk policy showed only a 3 
percent conviction rate between 
2009 and 2012, according to a 
report by the New York Attorney 
General. 2,400,000 stops by the 
New York Police Department 
resulted in 150,000 arrests, but 
only 75,000 led to a conviction or 

a guilty plea. NYPD’s policy was 
ruled unconstitutional earlier this 
year, yet the administration of out-
going mayor Michael Bloomberg 
has filed an appeal. 

Bloomberg’s term as mayor will 
end on Dec. 31. The newly elected 
mayor, Bill de Blasio, is an opponent 
of the policy and has pledged to 
replace the police chief, Ray Kelly. 

“The attorney general’s report 
has confirmed what young men of 
color have known for years — that 
the Bloomberg administration’s 
stop-and-frisk crusade is targeting 
innocent people and is pathetically 
ineffective and inefficient in appre-
hending criminals,” New York Civil 
Liberties Union executive director 
Donna Lieberman said. 

The Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Improvements Act, 
promoted by Dianne Feinstein, the 
California Democrat who chairs 
the Senate Intelligence Committee, 
would both make permanent a 
loophole permitting the National 
Security Agency to search for 
Americans’ identifying information 
without a warrant. 

And her proposed act might 
allow the FBI, the DEA and other 
law enforcement agencies to do the 
same wrong thing. 

I may vote for Senator Elizabeth 
Warren for president and Carl 
DeMaio for congress in November 
of next year. Go Tritons — I should 
live so long!

WHEN FAMILY IS IN TOWN...

BREAKFAST HIKING
MUSEUMS

DINNER

Tucked into a corner on 30th 
street in South Park, Big Kitch-
en is one of the best breakfast 
diners in the county. Once 
inside, be prepared to bump el-
bows (literally) with your fellow 
customers — seating is closely 
packed — and make small 
talk with staff.  Aside from the 
colloquial vibe from the people, 
there are knick-knacks all over 
the walls, including bumper 
stickers, photos and signs that 
tout the diner’s history. Big 
Kitchen’s menu features every-
thing from biscuits and gravy 
to a world-famous plate-sized 
pancake. It’s big. So big, that if 
you can finish two, the second 
pancake is free.

Located in Poway, about half an 
hour from UCSD, Mt. Woodson 
offers two challenging trails to 
intrepid hikers. The first, and most 
popular, is about eight miles of 
steady uphill hiking, so plan for a 
four-hour outing, and bring lots of 
water. The second trail is a paved 
service road that may be shorter 
but is no less challenging with its 
steep incline. Whichever way you 
go, you’ll find yourself amongst 
picturesque views of San Diego 
that stretch all the way to the 
ocean on a clear day. Best of all, 
the infamous Potato Chip Rock 
perches on top of Mt. Woodson, 
and if you’re willing to wait in 
line, you can get a photo souvenir 
of your daring trek.

— Aleksandra Konstantinovic

If you’ve got the kind of family 
where simple decision-making 
turns into blood-curdling argu-
ments, Balboa Park’s 17 muse-
ums should appease all strong 
personalities. The Timken Mu-
seum of Art is always free, and 
each Tuesday, one of the other 
museums has free entry if you 
bring your UCSD student ID. Top 
museum picks include the Air 
and Space Museum and the San 
Diego Museum of Man, which 
is currently featuring a BEERol-
ogy exhibit about the history of 
beer in San Diego and around 
the world. If even the muse-
ums won’t quell your family’s 
bickering, take a walk around 
the Botanical Building, wander 
the koi ponds or check out Sun 
God artist Niki de Saint Phalle’s 
sculpture “Poet and Muse,” 
located in front of the Mingei 
Museum of International Art.

— Rachel Huang

Just a quick drive down Mi-
ramar Road, Punjabi Tandoor 
is every UCSD student’s go-to 
stop for Indian food. The pric-
es are low, and the portions 
are plentiful at this popular 
hole in the wall, which always 
attracts a crowd. Be warned, 
though; Punjabi Tandoor has 
very little in-restaurant seat-
ing, so all meals — offered 
on Styrofoam plates and 
in to-go containers — will 
need to be taken outside. The 
chicken tikka masala and the 
rogan josh, a lamb curry, are 
among the favorites at the 
family-owned and -operated 
restaurant. Add a serving of 
naan for $1.95, along with 
a cup of complimentary 
rice pudding, and you’ll be 
stuffed.

COFFEE

DRINKSBEACH
SIGHTSEEING

Bird Rock Coffee Roasters, 
located in almost-kitschy Bird 
Rock (a residential beach town 
just north of PB), offers the 
perfect combination of a cozy 
coffee house, homey decor — 
art from the local elementary 
school dons the walls — and 
beachy air, not to mention some 
of the best coffee you’ll find in 
San Diego, and maybe even 
California. Bird Rock practices 
direct trade, so it communi-
cates with coffee farmers and 
sends extra profits their way in 
the case of a high-rated roast. 
Whether or not you’re a coffee 
nerd, Bird Rock’s got something 
for you: coffee die-hards can 
choose from a variety of black 
coffees, sourced from Kenya, 
Guatamala, Honduras and El 
Salvador, while those who are 
still making the transition away 
from Starbucks can grab a re-
ally good latte.

— Allie Kiekhofer

Just three or four bus stops 
away from campus on the MTS 
201/202 SuperLoop you’ll find 
some of the cheapest — and 
decent enough — sushi in all of 
San Diego. KI Sushi’s happy hour 
deal includes 30 percent off all 
specialty rolls, so the cheaper 
ones are a real steal. Try the 
Crazy Boy, a deep-fried California 
roll sliced vertically into spears, 
only $5 for six surprisingly filling 
pieces. KI Sushi’s also popular for 
its sake bombs — be ready for 
happy hour to get kind of noisy 
— and it’s been known to only ID 
the first guest who orders alco-
hol. Do with that knowledge what 
you will.

— Dorothy Van

If you’re tired of sitting on the 
sand or get too chilly in the 
water but still want to experi-
ence fantastic beach scenery, 
grab your date and take the MTS 
Route 30 down to Pacific Beach, 
where you can rent a beach 
cruiser for only $20 for a day. 
Pacific Beach Cruisers is located 
on Garnet Avenue between 
Gresham and Haines. Once 
you’ve got your bike, you’re free 
to roam all of PB, including three 
miles of bike paths up and down 
the coast. Luckily, if you get 
tired of biking, you’re still in PB, 
with ice cream shops and bars 
galore, so finding somewhere to 
take a snack break should be a 
cinch.

— Stacey Chien

As you drive across the 
sweeping arc of the 2.1-mile-
long, 200-foot high San Diego-
Coronado Bridge, the view of 
Coronado Island waiting below 
already looks too pristine to 
be real. Walking around past 
the pristine houses, mile-wide 
streets with park-sized street 
dividers and extravagant, late 
19th-century architecture, you 
might feel like anything you 
touch will disintegrate into 
a million pieces. Coronado’s 
full of kitschy souvenir shops 
and overpriced artisan candy 
shops you want to think you’re 
too good to shop at, even 
though you know you’ll come 
home with a $5 block of fudge 
anyway. Make sure to check 
out the historic Hotel del Coro-
nado, which opened in 1888 
to become one of the world’s 
first luxury resort hotels and, 
later, the site of “Some Like it 
Hot,” the iconic 1959 Marilyn 
Monroe comedy

BAR TRIVIA

Hash House A Go Go is a sur-
real experience. With portion 
sizes that’ll make you feel 
smaller than an American Girl 
Doll, a trip to Hash House is not 
to be taken lightly — fasting 
the day beforehand is some-
thing to seriously consider. 
Pancakes come on platters 
and are around the size of a 
toddler; eggs and potatoes 
come in skillets that could also 
be used as anchors. Biscuits 
look more like small loaves 
of bread with a shrub-sized 
sprig of rosemary sticking out 
the top, and they’re damned 
good. Bring a friend or three 
along to split some dishes, or 
else be prepared to bring home 
another full day’s worth of left-
overs — to be expected for the 
roughly $15 price tag attached 
to most items on the menu.

— Allie Kiekhofer

We know what you’re think-
ing — the best tacos in all of 
San Diego can be found on a 
practically residential street in 
North PB? But to the skeptics, 
we say, just go try it. Oscar’s is a 
hole-in-the-wall, cash-only joint 
crammed next to a dive bar, with 
less square footage than your 
dorm and fewer seats than most 
dining room tables. The menu is 
limited, but everything on it is to 
die for. Oscar’s gets all the little 
things right: They melt cheese 
onto their tortillas before they fill 
‘em with food so that you won’t 
get any cold, unmelted shreds, 
and the avocado they scoop onto 
some of their tacos is perfectly 
creamy every time. Both the 
smoked fish and spicy shrimp 
tacos pack some serious flavor, 
or, if tortillas hold you back, go 
straight for the cup of shrimp 
ceviche. Don’t waste your time 
with the burritos — they’re the 
size of a taco but a different 
shape and a dollar more.

— Claire Yee

Once you discover thrifting — and 
if you haven’t, get on it — there 
are a few kinds of thrift stores 
you’ll find. There’s the faux-
upscale kind that sells mainly 
clothing from mid-range stores 
two or three years ago (think Urban 
Outfitters marked down around 
$10 from retail price). There’s the 
basically-a-warehouse kind that’s 
filled with piles of giant ugly ’80s 
sweaters, all of which smell like 
your grandparents’ house, for 
g$2 apiece. Flashbacks strikes a 
delicate balance between these 
two: It’s got a selection of clothing 
that’s vintage and fairly eclectic, 
but pieces tend not to be too gaudy 
— many are trendy and totally 
wearable. Flashbacks has been 
home to some to-die-for ’50s, 
’60s and ’70s frocks, and if you’re 
quick, you might lucky enough to 
snag one.

— Zoe McCracken

With around 10 different 
pizzas to choose from every 
week, even more San Diego 
craft brews on tap — or Bud 
Light and lambic, for your 
less adventurous friends — 
and a staff of bartenders so 
friendly they seem like they’re 
straight out of a sitcom, Ciro’s 
Pizzeria and Beerhouse on 
Garnet in PB is the ultimate 
place to bring your friends 
for trivia. The bar hosts trivia 
nights twice a week, on Tues-
days and Thursday evenings. 
Correctly answering a chal-
lenge question in the middle 
of the trivia session will earn 
a free pitcher of beer for you 
and your teammates, and the 
top-scoring teams at the end 
of the night win gift cards 
to Ciro’s — so do well, and 
you’ll be back for sure.

half with neither team’s lead ever 
reaching double digits. The Tritons led 
30–25 at halftime behind a strong 10 
points from Seto.

“We did a lot of nice things 
today,” second-year head coach Heidi 
VanDerveer said. “We had a lot of 
good energy from everyone.”

In the second half, UCSD lost their 
halftime lead when the Coyotes went 
on a 13–6 run. A successful three-
point attempt and layup by Seto — 
who finished with a career-high 21 
points to go with five assists and four 
steals — with 10 minutes to play, gave 
the Tritons the lead for good.

Seto starts this season at shooting 
guard. Senior Stephanie Yano, who 
red-shirted last season due to an inju-
ry, will take over the point from Seto.

“I think everyone [is] doing well 
in their new roles,” Seto said after the 
game. “It takes a bit of the pressure off 
of me to not have to bring the ball up 
every time.”

Most of the Tritons’ scoring was 
done by the senior class, with guard 
Megan Perry scoring 13 points and 
forward Erin Dautremont — recover-
ing from illness — adding 10.

Forward Taylor Hirz led the 
Tritons on the boards by grabbing six 
rebounds in her noticeably expanded 

role on the block. Hirz averaged eight 
minutes last season and saw 19 min-
utes in Sunday’s game.

“Taylor has really come into her 
own,” VanDerveer said of the Marshall 
College sophomore. “She’s been really 
aggressive in practice and in the game 
and a lot of this is really the level of 
aggressiveness.”

Three freshmen saw playing 
time and scored in their first game 
for UCSD, including forward Cassie 
MacLeod, who hit her first and only 
three-point attempt as a Triton in the 
first half.

On defense, the Tritons notched 
eight steals but had 18 turnovers on 
offense.

“I think we need to get into more of 
a flow offensively, but defensively we’re 
on the same page,” VanDerveer said. 
“We’re going to keep getting better.”

The win is a nice change for the 
Tritons who started last season 0–3 
with a trio of losses in a preseason 
invitational. 

The Tritons will head up to 
Azusa later this week for the West 
Region Crossover Classic where 
they’ll face Seattle Pacific and 
Western Washington on Friday and 
Saturday nights.

McCutchan was named this week’s 
the CCAA Player of the Week.

After going perfect — 11 kills on 
0 errors — the middle blocker was 
named the CCAA women’s volley-
ball player of the week. McCutchan 
was also integral to UCSD this week-
end, finishing with 27 kills. 

Three other Tritons collected 
over 25 kills this weekend; junior 
opposite Caitlin Brenton (39) and 
sophomore outside hitters Danielle 
Dahle (30) and Sophie Rowe (26). 

Libero Brittany Lombardi led the 
UCSD defense by saving a total of 46 
digs this weekend.

UCSD hosts CCAA league lead-
ing and No. 14 nationally ranked 

Cal State San Bernardino this 
Wednesday, Nov. 20. This Friday, the 
Tritons head back out on the road to 
take on Cal State Los Angeles.

UCSD plays its last conference 
game at home this Saturday against 
Cal State Dominguez Hills.

S ix kickers deep into a penalty kick shootout that would decide who, between UCSD and Chico State, would advance to the third round of the NCAA Tournament, 
senior goalkeeper Josh Cohen was tasked to make his third 
penalty save of the night.

Having already faced five Chico State kickers and made an 
unheard-of two penalty kick stops, the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association Defensive Player of the Year made a diving 
save to deny Chico’s Justin Saul.

“At that point we had already taken our seventh penalty, so 
there wasn’t much pressure on me,” Cohen said. “I basically just 
watched their guy approach the ball and went with my instinct. 
I was just able to get my arm all the way out there and was able 
to make the save.”

The penalty kicks came after 110 minutes of play, resulting 
in a 1–1 draw.

In front of a crowd of nearly 1,000 people, second-seeded 
UCSD faced No. 3 Chico State for the fourth time this season. 
The Wildcats took the early lead when Chico’s Matt Hurlow 
found himself unmarked 25 yards out. In the eighth minute, 
Hurlow hit a rocket to put Chico up 1–0. UCSD equalized 10 
minutes later on a header by senior defender Gavin Lamming, 
who got on the other end of a free kick by Andisheh Bagheri.

“Our guys did a great job after giving up an early goal,” 
UCSD head coach Jon Pascale said. “I think they could have 
easily crumbled playing in front of such a big crowd, but they 
answered right back with a goal of their own.”

Unable to break the tie in regulation, the Tritons played 
through two overtime periods — marking the third straight 
overtime bout between the two CCAA powerhouses.

All-CCAA first team selection Alec Arsht and senior mid-
fielder Cory Wolfrom both logged significant minutes despite 
having been involved in a car accident with a driver that ran a 
red light just hours before the match. 

With the 1–1 tie, the Tritons will advance to play No. 12 
nationally ranked Simon Fraser — who beat Cal State Los 
Angeles last Saturday — in the third round of the NCAA 
Tournament. 

UCSD has not faced Simon Fraser this season, but Cohen 
said the match will likely feature UCSD’s league-leading defense 
and Simon Fraser’s dynamic front line, which has the second 
highest goals per game average in the nation with 3.44.

“From what it seems, Simon Fraser’s very offensive-minded, 
they average over three goals a game, so it will be interesting to 
see our defense take on their offense,” Cohen said.

This Wednesday, UCSD will travel to Denver, Colo., where 
the West Regional finals will be held. 

The Tritons will meet Simon Fraser Friday, Nov. 22.
The winner will advance to the Elite Eight to face the winner 

between hosts Regis and Midwestern State.

With eight consecutive wins in 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association, UCSD seems to be 
peaking as they head into playoffs. 
Last Friday, the Tritons took down 
Cal State Monterey Bay in five sets 
before beating Cal State East Bay 
in four. 

With the weekend wins the 
Tritons improve to 23–3 overall and 
16–3 in conference play — holding 
on to second place at two games 
behind CCAA leader Cal State San 

Bernardino.
For the second time this season, 

UCSD took the court against Cal 
State Monterey Bay, this time at the 
Kelp Bed. The Tritons struggled in 
the first two sets and found them-
selves on the verge of being swept, 
but they rallied to win the next 
three sets. The match featured 45 tie 
scores and 19 total lead changes.

Triton setter Heidi Sierks estab-
lished a new career-high with 70 
assists.

“We really pulled off a great win 
against a good team,” UCSD head 

coach Ricci Luyties said to the UCSD 
Athletics Department.  “I was very 
impressed with our ability to not 
give in and keep playing hard when 
things weren’t going well. Everyone 
made big plays during crunch time.”

The next day the Tritons took 
on Cal State East Bay on the road. 
UCSD dropped the first set 18–25 
but showed no mercy in the three 
next sets, winning 25–23, 25–23 and 
25–18.

WOMEN'S  BASKETBALL WOMEN'S  VOLLEYBALL

UCSD’s women’s basketball team 
defeated conference foe Cal State San 
Bernardino 70–65 in the Tritons’ first 
game of the season.

For the first time, UCSD began 
the regular season with a conference 
matchup without the aid of a couple 
preseason tune-up games.

“It’s a little nerve-racking to start a 
season with a conference game, but we 
held our own and stuck it out together 
for the win,” senior guard Miranda 
Seto said.

After junior forward McKennan 
Bertsch opened the game with a layup, 
the teams exchanged leads in the first
