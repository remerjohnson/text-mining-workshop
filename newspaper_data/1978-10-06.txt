Media Plan Modified,Press Mollified 
By Jeff Beresford-Howe 

Associate New. EcU&or 
AS Commissioner of Com-

munications Bill Friedman's 
proposal to require all campus 
media to be self-sufficient in 

three years has been with-
drawn by Friedman, the AS 
Rules Committee, announced 
Monday night. 

The funding requirements, 
part of a plan to constitute a 
campus Media Boa r d , had 
received a harshly negative 
reaction from almost all 
campus media representa-
tives. 

Despite the withdrawal ofthe 
most controversial parts of 
Friedman's proposal, the Rules 
Committee took testimony 
from representatives of most of 
the campus journals on the 
re m aining sections of the 
Media Board proposal, as well 
as considering additions to that 
proposal. 

Nearly all campus media at 
the hearinJ( condemned Fried-

man for his alleged fa ilure to 
consult with campus media 
before drawing up his Media 
Board proposal. KSDT General 
Manager Brad Thornburg said 
Friedman's assertion that he 
had made extensive media 
contacts before drawing up his 
proposal was a " blatant lie." 

Most media representatives, 
including Jon Bekken of the 
unpublished Forum and Thorn-
berg, indicated they wanted 
media representation on the 
Media Board. Some, such as 
L'Chayim editor Jamie Adler, 
were willing to' settle for ex-
officio membership on any 
Board. The proposal , as it 
currently stands, explicitly 
prohibits media representa-
tives. 

I Sponsored by New Commission 

Mayo~iallnternship ~pen 
Applications are now avail-

able for the position of Mayoral 
Liaison sponsored by the newly 
re -established San Diego 
County Colle,giate Council 
(SDCCC) . " This is a hot 
position," said Jim Lofgren, 
ASUCSD commissioner of 
external affairs. 

" If UCSD could get a student 
to work at the Mayor's Office it 
would be a great advantage to 
us in that we could work 
directly with the Major re-
garding (such issues as) rent 
control and bus service," 
explained Lofgren. 

The original SDCCC, which 
disbanded two years ago, had 
been formed in order to facili-
tate communication among the 
various San Diego county 

college campuses and to enable 
students to become a political 
voice in San Diego county. 

The SDCCC boasted such 
achievements as co-sponsorinJ( 
President Ford 's economic 
conference in San Diego , 
sponsoring two intercollegiate 
art shows in 1975 and holding a 
conference in 1976 which 
brought students, counselors 
and academic advisors to-
gether to discuss some of the 
problems and difficulties 
students were having. 

The new SDCCC, which met 
for the first time two weeks ago, 
has established a student 
liasion position with Mayor 
Pete Wilson's office to which 
applications will be accepted 
until Oct. 11. Applications can 

. be picked up at the AS offices. 

The position will pay $200 for 
the year. 

AmoDg the goals of tM new 
SDCCC is "conducting an 
effective lobby against the 
imposition of tuition in pub-
.licly-supported institutions of 
higher education in the state of 
California; supporting a coun-
ty-wide voter registration drive 
aimed at achieving a high voter 
registration percentage among 
college age students in San 
Diego County; (and) sup-
porting local city-wide ordinan-
ces which will make student 
discrimination in housing 
illegal," according to a memor-
andum issued by Rob DeKoven, 
chairman of SDCCC. 

Lofgren found a recent· 
SDCCC meeting with Wilson to 
be " very productive." 

- Ran Anbar 

Because of AS Council action 
last week, the Rules Committee 
has until next Wednesday to 
present a final proposal to the 
Council. Hearings will be 
conducted between now and 
then to determine the shape of 
the proposal. 

In the meantime, funding for 
one issue of each paper has 
been given to the various 
media, and KSDT has already 
been given over $10,000 for the 
year by the AS and the Vice-
Chancellor of Student Affairs 
office. 

120 Students Still 
Can't Find Housing 

By Eric Harpell 
Two weeks into the school 

year, almost 120 students are 
still waiting for openings in on-
campus housing, according to 
figures released by the UCSD 
housing office. 

From the fir st we ek of 
orientation until the present, 
" SO students (from the waiting 
list) ha ve e ither declined 
housing, or have been housed 
on-campu s, " said Debbie 
Bauman of the Housing office. 
While this represents a sub-
stantial decrease from the 
original waiting list of 200, 

the~e stil! exists a problem for 
those who must commute 20 or 
more miles to school each day. 

Off-campus housing, which is 
the only alternative for stu-
dents not within commuting 
distance, is also showing a 
shortage. Rick Bayer, of the on-
campus housing office, attri-
butes the of(-campus housing 
shorta ge to many factors, 
including the la rge number of 
staff and administrative per-
sonnel (UCSD has an 11-10 staff 
to student ratio, as compared to 
other UCs where the ratio 
ranges from 1: 5 to 1: 2) , the full-
time salaried personnel from 
the VA Hospital and the various 
resear ch clin ics in the im-
mediate area of UCSD. Typi-
cally, landlords prefer to have 

stable, fixed salaried persons 
as tena nts , as opposed to 
transient college students. 

Bayer also expects that, at 
this time, waiting list figures 
will not be indicative of the 
number of students actually 
waiting for housing. He said 
that "many students do not tell 
us when they have found an off-
campus place. They wait for us 
to contact them." 

Although the housing situa-
tion is not promising for the 
immediate future, the addition 
of 600 new spaces on the Third 
and Warren campuses should, 
according to Bayer, " take care 
of the problem." Due to the 
addition of the new units, the 
Mesa apartments are sched-
uled to be phased out for use by 
undergraduates and returned 
to their original purpose: use 
by graduate and married 
students. 

Currently, an uneven dis-
tribution of enrollment to 
housing space causes many 
Third and Warren students to 
be housed at Muir and Revelle 
colleges, respectively . Muir 
college bas on-campus housing 
space for 930 students, while 
Warren college has space for 
236 . Said Bayer, however, 
"Warren is larger in terms of 
enrollment. .. 

Thomas · Argues Against 'Third' Name 
By Jeff Beresford-Howe 

Aaoelale News Editor 
Charles Thomas, Chairman 

of the Third College Urban and 
Rural Studies program, didn't 
like the name Third College, 
and he didn't like the selection 
process the college had em-
ployed to chooae it. 

So, Thomas conducted his 
own straw poll, and based on 
that poll, plus his own objec-
tions to the process, he has been 
part of a successful effort to 
prevent permanent recognition 
of the name "Third College." 

Over the summer, Thomas 
wrote letters protestiq the 
name to Muir Provost John 
Stewart, Chairman of the 
Chancellor's Advisory Com-
mittee on Naming Streets, 
Buildinp, Colleges and Facili-
ties, Chancellor William McEl-
roy and Third Provost Joseph 
Watson. After he sent those 
letters. Stewart's committee 
reversed itself, and recom-
mended that the naminl be 

delayed for "several years," a 
recommendation McElroy has 
accepted. 

Stewart says that faculty 
letters opposin, the name were 
instrumental in his commit-
tee's change of mind, and both 
he and McElroy read excerpts 
of T homas' lette r to Tbe 
Guardian in explaining their 
decision. 

Because of his role in the 
naming delay, Thomas has 
come under fire from those who 
say that the college name was 
democratically chosen in last 
Sprinl's mail vote, and that the 
name accurately reflects the 
colle,e's hIstory and outlook. 
Critics also say that Thomas 
participated in the naming 
process as a Third Collele 
Council faculty member, and 
thus should abide by the 
Council's decision. 

When Tbe Guardian talked to 
Thomas yesterday, he took 
issue with all those charges. 

The voting method employed 
came under attack first. "Their 
position is suspect," he said, 
" because the people histor-
ically involved in the histOl'Y of 
the college were ignored." 

To remedy that, Thomas 
conducted his own telephone 
poll of approximately fifty 
black alumni, students and 
parents. His results: " I could 
find no significant sentiment 
for naming the college 'Third'. 
The pattern was to name the 
college after a black person." 

The person Thomas says was 
most often mentioned in his 
informal poll was Frederick 
Douglass, 19th century Ameri-
can writer and abolitIonist, and 
that is the name he supports. 

The name Douillass College 
was on last spring's ballot, but 
was defeated overwhelmingly, 
finishing third out of three 
names. Third College was the 
easy vic~or in that election,

In response to a letter from 

Stefanie Ramsda le , Oct. 2, 
1978: 
Dear Stefanie, 

I'm very sorry that you were 
" hideously violated " " on a 
bright Tuesday morning". 
Things like that are uncalled 
for, and certainly should be 
severely punished. 

However, I fail to see the 
point of comparing your pre-
vious assault to this incident. 
The people here in Galathea 
that I have talked to are not 
concerned with your history of 
" violations" , but are worried 
about the present incident in 
which they are directly in-
volved. 

I believe that the residents of 
Galathea Hall deserve more 
consideration than you have 
given us. How do you know that 
the rock (we were told that it 
was a piece of fruit) came from 
our " shadowy alcoves" ? lfyou 
had turned towards Argo, or 
Discovery, or any other dorm, 
you would see faces peering out 
of their alcoves also . 

Your letter makes us in 
Galathea HaU sound like slimy 
vipers waiting to attack and 
suck the blood of any unsus-
pecting damsel that passes by. 
Do they put all of the misfits in 
Galathea Hall? 1 doubt it. I've 
heard that most dorms are

Thomas responds to .the

of the college than 1 do in the 
short range to the Council," be

One of Thomas' less noted 

objections to the name "Third" 
is his belief that the name Is not 
attracting black studenh. 
These students, he maintains, 
will go where they feel com-
fo rtable and welcome, and the 
name "Third" doesn't project 
that ima,e the way "Douglass

the Northern CaUfornia cam-
paip bas not attracted many

"We set our aim for one' 
million dollan to conduct a

palin." Jepsonaaid. "but so far 
we've got a bit leas than S2OO.000 
.. .It perplexes ua that so many 
people who normally live 
sizeable donations are juat not 
participating." 

One reason was suggested by 
Jim Foster, chairman of a "No 
on 6" fund· raiser for Northern 
California . Many well-to-do 
gays, he said. fear that the 
measure will pass and they are 

saving their contributions for a 
court battle. 

The respected California 
Poll, taken by Mervin Field, 
shows Proposition 6 leading by 
61 percent t031 percent. Levett, 

however, said other polls show 
sentiment divided almost so/so. 

Although not involved in the 
campai,n, Don Slater, head of 
the Hollywood Homosexual 
Information Center, said he has 

found people "astonishingly 
honest" in expressing their 
opposition to the measure. The 
reports of fear. he said, present 
" a bad image." " We see a

If you're a junior or a senior majoring in math, physics or 
engineering, the Navy has a program you should know about. 

It's called the Nuclear Propulsion Officer Candidate-
Collegiate Program (NUPOC-C for short) and if you qualify, 
you can earn as much as $650 a month right through your 
senior year. Then after 16 weeks of Officer Candidate School, 
you'll, receive an additional year of advanced technical 
educatioJ}. This would cost you thousands in a civilian school, 
but in the Navy, we p.ay you. And at the end of the year of 
training, you'll receive a $3,000 cash bonus. 

It isn't easy .. There ~ fewer than 400 openings and only 
one of every six applicants will be selected. But if you make 
it, you'll have qualified for an elite engineering training 
program. With unequaled hands-on respo~sibility, a $24,000 
salary in four years, and gilt-edged qualifications for jobs 
in private industry should you decide to leave the Navy 
later. (But we don't think you'll want to. ) 

Ask your placement officer to set up an interview with a 
Navy representative when he visits the campus on Oct. 17-18, 
or contact your Navy representative at 293-6444. 
If you prefer, send your r~sum~ to the Navy Nuclear Officer 
Program, Code 312-B537, 4015 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, 
Va. 22203, and a Navy representative will contact you directly. 
The NUPOC-Collegiate Program. It can do more than help

Ford Heads 
West to Vote 

GRAND RAPIDS, Miell. 
(AP) - Former President 
Gerald R. Ford is eiviDJ up bis 
Michigan voter registration 
and will cast his ballot in the 
November general elections 
from California, it was learned 
Tuesday. 

Ford'i residency question 
was raised by Albert R. Dllley, 
a Grand Rapids attorney, in a 
May 22 letter to the former 
president. He charled that 
Ford had no legal rieht to 
continue voting in Kent County. 

Ford told tbe Grand Rapids 
Press he did not decide to 
answer Dilley's letter until this 
week and that althoulh' he 
disagreed witb Dilley's inter-
pretation of Michigan election 
laws, "we do not wisb to have 
protracted litigation" on tbe 
question. 

"Betty and I have decided to 
register to vote in California 
and will do so in the next 
several days," Ford wrote 
Dilley on Monday, 

"Betty and I ltill own a bome 
in East Grand Rapids and we 
consider East Grand Rapids 
and Grand Rapids our real 
bome," be said. 

Dilley's letter to Ford in May 
said, in part: "Nowtbatyou are 
no longer boldinl any public 
office, this would be a ,000 time 
to conaider the matter of· your 
proper place of registration for 
votiOl PUJ"pC)la. 

"With the completion and 
occupancy of your new bome in 
Palm Sprlngl, wbicb event 
received wide publicity, no 
valid claim can any looJer be 
made that you and Betty are 
residents of the City of East 
Grand Rapids or the State of 
Micbilan. 

"The fact is that you bave not 
bad an actual residence within 
Kent County, u defined in 
Section 11 of tbe Mlchi,an 
Election Law Section 1.1011 
MSA, for upwards of 20 yean.

epidemics break out lD ba.pltal

year. Thirty to 50 percent of the 
victima die. 

A paua,e from a biololical 
warfare novel? No, lucb 
incidentl have actually oc-
curred in recent yean, and will 
continue with ,reater fre-
quency and blPer death tolll, 
accordiq to Dr. E.S. Ander-
son, palt prelident of tbe 
Enteric Reference Laboratory 
in London. 

(Martin Brown, former Weal 
Coalt Editor of Eavinulea& 
edited TIle SodaI Reap .... · 
bIHay of &lie Selends& (Mac-
Millan). He is an aasociate 
editor of Pacific Newl Serv-
ice.) 

Dr. Anderson recently 
warned a meetiOi of the Worid 
Health Organization in Milan, 
Italy, that tbe spread of drui-
resistant bacteria, which 
causes the epidemicI, is 
"probably past tbe point of no 
return." 

What causes tbese new dnIt-
resistant lerma to thrive and 
multiply? Tbe clUef culprit, 
said Andenon, il the UDCGD-
troUed and "_Iary pres-
crlptioa of antibiotics by the 
medical profeulon. 

It baa 1001 been known that 
proloqed exposure of a bac-
teria to the same antibiotic

numeroua antibiotic treat-
ments. 

The problem is particularly 
acute lD Third World countries 

. due to poor aanltatioo, and in 
even the best hospital wards of 
the advanced countriel, due to 
sew. effluent carryine drug-
resistant bacteria. A study in 
the authoritative Journal of 

tery. At lealt 130,000 persons 
were killed by tbia particular 
bacteria, whicb later studies 
sbowed was resistant to all 
antibiotics DOnnally used in 
treatment of dysentery. 

A similar epidemic of typboid 
broke out in Mexico between 
1971 and 1972 and produced 
100,000 illnesses. One in five 
victims died. 

now for at least 20 yean, and 
are so finnly entrenched that I 
fear tbey are here to stay. 

" ••• prolonged exposure of a bacterla ... would 
produce an altered strain of bacteria ••• '" 

"Yet calls. to limit tbese 
bazards have been energeti-
cally opposed by tbose who 
supply the materials for their 
generation," he said . " At-
tempts to introduce some fonn 
of control of antibiotic usage 
(have) been - and are -
fought tooth and nail by the 
phannaceutical industry ... " 

The problem of uncontrolled 
and escalating antibiotic usage 
bas so far received little 
attention from government 
health agencies. But that may 
change soon. Mike Ridbiogh, a 
spolesman for the medical 
division of tbe congressional 
Office of Technological Assess-
ment, told PNS that "OTA is 
considerinl a comprehensive 
study of prescribing patterns in 
American medicine. Part of 
this study," be added, " will 
deal with prescription of 
antibiotics and the problem of 
poasible antibiotic over-use, 
includln, the production of 
antibiotic resistant diseases." 

of bacteria resistant to the 
antibiotic. But over the put 28 
yean acientista bave learned 
that the antibiotics cbaqe the 
lenetic alnIcture of the bac-
teria in sucb a way as to buteo 
the process of druI-reaistaoce, 
and to allow the druI resistance 
factor to spread frem one type 
of bacteria to another throu&b 
contact. 

The implicationl of tbls 
dlacovery, f1nt made in Japan 
in 1951, are ominoua: Harmless 
bacteria whicb have become 
reliltant to numeroul anti-
biotics in the buman intestine 
can, in sewa,e, transfer the 
multiple resistance to diaeale-
produciDJ bacteria wbleb will 
eventually find their way back 
Into a buman bein,. Tbat 

Medical Microbiology reported 
three yean ago that, in lbe 
hospitals surveyed, up to 37 
percent of the bacteria in the 
.w.,e effluent was resistant 
to at least one fonn of anti-
biotic. And nearly 43 percent of 
the resistant bacteria carried 
tbe lo-called "R-factor," 
meaning it carried multiple 
drug resistance. 

The inevitable COIUIequence 
of such conditions bal already 
occurred. In II111 ·an epidemic 
of dru,-relistant dysentery 
started lD Guatemala and over 
the !lext three yean spread to 
Mexico and Central America. 
The deatb rate was 250 per 
100,000 people compared to just 
40 deatbl per 100,000 for 
normal, DOn-resistant dysen-

And even in developed coun-
tries, said Anderson, " wide-
spread and lethal outbreaks (of 
infection) are taking place, 
particularly in children's 
hospitals and pediatric 
units ..... Tbese infections, he 
said, are far more serious and 
communicable than previous 
outbreaks, and "infect 50 
percent of those at risk and kill 
20 to 30 percent of those 
infected," 

AnderBOn tenned this unin-
tentional production of dru,-
resistant bacteria a fonn of 
"genetic engineering," since it 
is brouebt about by the wide-
spread use of antibiotics wbicb 
cause bacterial mutations. The 
bazards, be warned in a recent 
article, "bave been manifest 

In fact, there is already a 
large body of evidence on the 
scope of the problem. Six years 
ago, Dr. Henry Simmons, 
director of the Bureau of Drugs 
of the Federal Drug Adminis-
tration , estimated that 60

The water polo team feU &0 a %-3 record last weekend. 

Poloists Flounder in Meet 
Defense Proves Triton Undoing 

By JOD Goetz 
Water polo coach Russ 

Hafferkamp always says that 
defense is the most important 
aspect of the sport. And when 
that defense is "nonexistent," 
the result is a lackluster 2-3 
weekend record, a record that 
could easily have ~n 1-4. 

"I don't feel we playe<fwell at 
all this weekend." said Haffer-
kamp. "The key to water polo is 
defense, and oun didn' t exist 
because of the Ilnmalurity of 
the team. their lack of concen-
tration , and their lack of 
experience. " 

The Tritons lost a close one to 
Grossmont, 16-15, and then 
headed north to Whittier for a 
weekend tournament. UCSD 
lost to Cal State Los Angeles 13-
6, and also lost starter Dan 
Crane, who sat out the re-
mainder of the tourney with a 
split nose suffered in the game. 

The team bounced back to 
beat Pomona 10-6, and then 
topped Whittier 10-9 in a game 
that Hafferkamp called "prob-
ably the worst game, overall, 
thatI've ever seen." San Diego 
was also drowned by Cal State 
Northridle IH.

qualities of aD earUer era. In 
rock music, the curreDt Great 
Dumb Hope is Bruce Spriq-
steen. SpriD,.teen sin,s about 
mindlessly racing tbrou,b the 
streets and making the same 
mistakes iD life over aDd over 
again like a true jerk, but it's 
obvious that be's only gol.., 
through the motions. A smart 
man acting stupid is wone thaD 
a phony; he's pathetic. 

Lost stupidity, like virginity, 
is a very difficult thin, to 
regain. The dearth of geDuine 
stupid talent in today 's music. 
comedy (Frank Fontaine is no 
longer with us) and acting (the 
early Brando was so cour-
ageously dumb) offers litUe 
hope for the future. What will It 
take to revene this trend. Sorry 
to say, I don't know. I'm not 
stupid.

Oedipus Meets 
Fate at State 

B7 WIWaIII G ...... 
The San Dielo State UnI-

venlty Theatre opeaed Its 71-71 
.easoD last Friday Di,bt. 
p."..tiq Jean Cocteau'.1'IIe I.., ..... Mat*'eeo SubeequeDt 
performances are acbeduIed 
for toaIIbt tbroqb Sunday, 
October 7, all at .: 01 pm. This 
praeatatioa beIIas what is 
billed a. the IDterDatioDal 
Sbowcue. a II'OUP of five plays 
from Fraace, Ruaaia, EOIlaad 
and the United Stalel. 

takingly writteD and portrayed 
by this CIIt. It is precisely iD the 
manipulation of these elemeDts 
that one finda ·Cocteau's a-
cblevement. wherein be sub-
.ume. aDd traD.ceDds tbe 
implications of Sopbocles' 
Oedlp •• Res - all of tbe 
characters contain aU of these 
elemeDts, all are battered 
about by ambltioD, pride and 
the esseDtial sexual motiva-
tion, yet none lose the attribute 
of uniqueness, of ineluctable 
individuality. Jean Cocteau set out. Ia 1m, 

to retell the famous leIend of 
Oedfpua, the cuned KiDI of 
TbebeI. 1'boqIl It is perilaPi 
incornct to attribute willful 
macblaatloal to a man who 
claimed that bIa better pieces, 
iDCludlDg ne l.fer •• 1 Ma-
dIbIe. were writteD by a beiq 
wblcb bad DO direct connection 
to his voUtioa or COII8Cioua self, 
wbo eftl' wrote the peice bad a 
marvelousleDae of the balaDce 
between mechanical or .ym-
bolic and bumaD portrayal. The 
langua,e of the orflinal is all 
familiar, modem French. aDd 
the cbaracterizations are 
deligbtfully bumaD, even 
comedic at the outset. It is in 
using a literal translation that 
the State Theatre company 
runs into their largest problem; 
the dialogue is iDtended to 
move amootbIy through the 
tirat two acts, touching ligbUy 
down into pun and allusioD, 
without 1081ag the fiow of aD 
actual event . Tbe sYDtax 
proves rough going for most of 
State's acton; their delivery 
become. inordinately wooden 
at times and their struggle is 
apparent eveD to those unfamil-
iar with French. 

The play is shot through with 
foreshadowings of and refer-
ences to the pervasive theme of 
incestuous lust. Given this 
theme. one might think that the 
play threatens to descend iDto a 
cheap Freudian psycbodrama; 
not so. Cocteau (or "I'autre." 
as be sometimes called his 
Muse) is careful to retain the 
classical dramatic elementa in 
his reteUiDl. There is bubris or 
pride in abuadance, Nemesis 
appears Ia the fIeab and the 
final catbarsls Is breatb-

This marria,e of the uni-
veraal and the unique is carried 
off pretty well by this cast, 
though there are several flaw. 
aDd unDece •• ary cODtradlc-
tions in the productioD. some of 
wblcb are. I suppose, Inevitable 
products of directorial inter-
pretation of the piece. The most 
obvious faux pas lie In the 
choice of co.tumes. The sol-
diers iD the first scene drew 
laugba with their blatanUy U.S. 
Marine Corps characteriza-
tions; why, then, are they 
weariDg French Legionnaire 
unifonns, complete with ber-
eta? Oedipus' coronation rai-
ment looks like a Sears sleeping 
bag spray-painted silver, a 
costume which becomes com-
pletely ridiculous as it gives 
way to pressed bell-bottoms 
(nice and tight in the a88). 
These costumes do not ruin the 
effect of the play by any means: 
they merely detract from it. 

The actiDg itself is good jf not 
outstandiD" with Sharon 
Oppenheimer's Jocasta on the 
negative .ide, Harold Surratt's 
Anubis on the positive. 

The set, which is the same 
throughout , is simple and 
appropriate; props are kept to 
a minimum. 

This is a gOud production of a 
fine play. There were a few 
flubbed lines last Friday. and 
the fly of Oedipus' groovy beU-
bottoms just wouldn 't stay up; I 
expect that these problems will 
be ironed out by tonight. This 
production doesn't quite live up 
to Cocteau's deSCription of the 
Theatre as " attacking by fire 
and by water," but it is well 
worth the low admission price 
and trip across lown to San 
Diego State.

Beagle Hall of the ReveUe Residence Halls 
has a unique community feeling whicb 18 nOl 
present in the other Revelle dorms, according to 
Judith Edwin, Revelle Resident Dean. "There's 
a ItrOq commitment to the dorm since all the 
students are Interested in languages," said 
Edwin. 

Realle Hall was converted to a LaDlUage 
House in Fall of 1m and presently bouses 70 
students divided into suites of German, French 
and Spanish. Edwin believes interest in 
laUJU8Ies iB corniDJ back to the U.S. "All other 
countries require at least English as a second 
language. America is the only country where 
people don't know two or three laDlUales," said 
Edwin. . 

Students in the LanlUale House were tested 
at the beginning and at the end of the last school 

year under the supervision of the Linpistics 
Department. Moat students improved tbeir 
scores sipificantly on the last test. It wa. 
unclear, however, wbether the difference wu 
attributable to participation in the LanlUale 
House prolram, as many students were 
concurrently enrolled in laDlUale courses at 
UCSD. 

Lanpale Prolram evaluations made by 
participatinl students were largely positive, 
accordinJ to a 1977-78 report issued by Edwin. 
"The validity of tbese evaluations were 
supported by the fact that Bealle tended to 
retain more students durinJ the year than other 
dorms, aa well as those who bad advanced to the 
junior and even senior level in class standini, .. 
sbe said in Ule report. 

Revelle would like to make tbe Language 
Proeram a permanent part of their Residence 
Halls, according to Edwin. "The interest that 
incominl freshmen bave shown in IivinJ in the 
dormitory (in Im-7.) indicates strong cllaDces 
for its success in the future," Edwin said in her 
report.

A 1m study by Wayne Ray 
and his collelUes at Vanderbilt 
Vniversity School of Medicine 
examined the records of 59,000 
children in the Tennessee 
Medicaid program. That study 
found that over a two-year 
period, antibiotics were the 
most common drugs~ pres-
cribed, accounting for 134,126 
prescriptions, or 39 percent of 
all prescriptions. Less than half 
of-the more than 7,000 pres-
criptions for tetracycline, a 
broad-spectrum antibiotic, 
could be justified by a proper 
diagnosis of bacterial Infection, 
said the study. 

Another report in 1976 sur-
veyed 20 acute care hospitals In 
the United States and found 
that 30 percent of all inpatients 

received antibiotics . A large 
portion of these doses were 
prescribed for "prophylactic" 
purposes, or to prevent infec-
tion from occurring during and 
after surgery, said the study. 

Yet, according to Dr. Steven 
Barriere, professor of clinical 
phannacololY at the Univer-
sity of California Medical 
School in San Francisco, and an 
expert on the useofantibiotics, 
" There are very few pr:o-
cedures where antibiotic 
prophylaxis really seems 
indicated. 

"However," he added, "you 
still see antibiotics used all the 
time .. . The impression I have is 
that antibiotic use is on the 
increase." (Pleue &1InI to pap 11)

"Ilarinl differences in the 
ways in which the same multi-

panies delCribe essentially the 
same drug products to physi-
cians in the United States and to 
their medical colleagues in

Restrictions on sales promo-
tion of drugs which are ob-
served in the United States are 
"curtailed, glossed over or 
totally omitted" by pharma-
ceutical companies operating 
in Central and South America, 
he claimed, Also, he said, the 
drug overuse problem is 
further auravated in Latin 
America by the fact that many 
antibiotics, such as chloram-
phenicol, are often available 

over-the-counter, without a 
doctor's PrelCriptiOD . 

Chloramphenicol, be said, 
has become "a dally self-
medication for all ills and 

' aches," in many Latin Amer-
