Student Fee Increase 
Drops Seven Percent 
By MEGAN O'KEEFE 
Sta/fWriter 

UCSD students can expect to 
see a substantial reduction in win-
ter and spring registration fees this 
year due to a recent UC Regents 
decision to lower fee increases to 
three percent over last year. 

The Regents voted July 21 to 
reduce the student fee increase from 
10 percent, as had been previously 
decided, to three percent for the 
1989-90 academic year as a result 
of a more favorable state budgeL 
The state's improved fiscal situ-
ation allowed the governor and the 
Legislature to provide the $12 
million necessary to reduce fees. 

The current student fee policy, 
put into effect in 1985, limits an-
nual student fee increases to three 
percent. The policy is due to expire 
in 1990, and future fee policies 
have no specified increase limit. 

The current policy alSt' allows 
for a to percent fee increase in 
"exceptional cases." 

According to Paul West of the 
UC President David Gardner's 
Office. "not having enough UC 
budget funds to cover expenses 
was sufficient reason" for the UC 
to invoke the exceptional case 
clause, resulting in the 10 percent 
increase previously announced this 
year. 

According to University of 
California Studeht Association 
(UCSA) member Pam Derby, the 
reduction in fees was due to suc-

cessful lobbying efforts by the 
UCSA and other student groups. 

Both UC officials and UCSA 
members hope that the state legis-
lature will continue to help the UC 
maintain minimal student fee in-
creases. 

UCSA member Lee Butterfield 
said the UCSA is "hoping, and is 
relativly confident," that the 
govemer and legislature will con-
tinue to approve the current fee 
policy, as they are "committed to a 
low fee cost." 

West also believes that "most 
legislators would support a mini-
mum increase at best," but future 
fee policy "really depends on the 
budget situation," he said. 

Unless state spending limits 
"Proposition 98 and the Gann limit 
are changed, the UC will have to 
limit the number of students or 
increase fees," West observed. 

West added that "this year's 
out-of-state fee increase of 17 
percent will remain despite the 
reduction of in-state fees." 

Because the cost of issumg re-
funds for fall fees would be too 
great, UCSD students will see their 
refunds reflected in decreased 
winter and spring fee costs, Asso-
ciate Registrar Officer Sally 
Hickok-Broxton said. 

According to Hickok-Broxton, 
the fee increase will remain at 10 
percent for the fall quarter, but will 
be reduced for the winter and spring 
quarters to reflect a three percent 
increase for the entire year. Fees 
will be lowered to $538 for spring 
and winter quarter.

A visiting motorist buys a night parking permit. Enforcement of night and weekend parking 
regulations began this summer. 

• Night Parking Fees Implemented 
By RANDY DOTINGA 
StajJWriter 

New parking regulations which 
took effect July 1 mean that night 
and weekend visitors to UCSD 
must now pay to park on campus. 

The new regulations do not 
affect holders of faculty, staff, and 
student permits, which are still 
valid at all times. 

Parking permits are now re-
quired from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. on 
weekdays and from to a.m. to lJ 
p.m. on weekends, except on Uni-
versity-designated holidays. 

Parking meters will also be 
enforced during these hours. 

According to Associate Vice 
Chancellor of Business Affairs 
George Himel, the new regulations 
are intended to make the parking 
situation at UCSD more equitable, 
by charging all people who use the 
campus parking lots, instead of 
just daytime parkers. 

"Basically, what we've had is a 
system where the people that park 
in the daytime were paying the 
entire bill" for campus parking 
costs, he said. 

if bought between 3 p.m. and 11 
p.m. 

Registered students may buy 
long-term night and weekend park-
ing permits for $4 a quarter. Ini-
tially, the administration an-
nounced that this permit would 
cost $3 a quarter and be goop in 
only one northern Third College 
lot. But after disc ussions last month 
with A.S. officials, the administra-
tion decided that a $4 permit would 
be good in all student lots.

night and weekend parking for non-

The Parking and Transporta-

tions later this school year to de-
cide whether to continue the pol-

Both Zeta Beta Tau and Tau 
Kappa Epsilon national fraterni-
ties have decided to abolish pledg-
ing in all their chapters. 

Members of Zeta Beta Tau 
(ZBn voted last September to 
eliminate the period of pledges hip 
for its initiates. ZBT will imple-
ment the new policy this fall. 

Tau Kappa Epsilon (TKE) will 
gradually implement a program to 
eliminate pledging -over the next 
two years. 

According to the standards set 
by its national fraternity, ZBT 
must intitiate all prospective 
members within 96 hours of the 
end of rush, according to UCSD 
ZBT Chapter President Steve 
Petralia. 

"Within 24 hours of the end of 
rush there will be a pre-initiation 

meeting where the guidelines and 
obligations of the fraternity will be 
presented to [those with bids to 
join]. Within 72 hours of the pre-
initiation meeting we must fully 
initiate them," Petralia said. 

When its system is funy imple-
mented, TKE wiJ) initiate mem-
bers within two weeks of the end of 
rush, according to UCSD TKE 
chapter vice president Michael 
Lopez. He feels that the two weeks 
will give those interested an op-
portunity to decide if they want to 
become active members of TKE. 

According to TKE national 
spokesperson David Adcock, a 
resolution to end pledging was first 
presented to the Fraternity Execu-
tives Association (FEA), an or-
ganization of 59 national fraterni-
ties, in its annual meeting held in 
July, 1988. 

Though the resolution to end 
pledging for an 59 fraternities was 

rejected, another resolution was 
agreed upon, which asked each 
member of the FEA to evaluate its 
own membership structure to de-
termine if something could be done 
to eliminate hazing. ZBT and TKE 
felt that eliminating pledging would 
accomplish this. 

Hazing, the physical or verbal 
abuse of pledges or forcing pledges 
to do something against their wills, 
has claimed the lives of 50 stu-
dents nationwide in the past dec-
ade alone. 

"Zeta Beta Tau has concluded 
that th~ only way to eliminate 
hazing is to abolish its window of 
opportunity," ZBT National Vice 
President Dr. RonaldJ. Taylor said 

Petralia, Lopez and UCSD IFC 
president Curtis Bowden feel, 
however, that UCSD does not have 
the hazing problem that other cam-
puses face. 

See PLEDGE, pqe 11 

He added that the new fees have 
resulted in a reduced increase in 
the cost of regular parking permits. 

A student permit for the 1989-
90 school year will cost $171, an 
increase of $3 per month over last 
year. TIle increase would have been 
$5 or $6 per month wid\.out the 
introduction of night and weekend 
parking fees, Himel said. 

According to Parking and Al-
ternative Transportation Systems 
Manager Bob Umstead, the in-
crease is necessary to pay for the 
rise in operating costs and "princi-
pal and interest on the money we 
borrow" to landscape and build 
parking lots and roadways. 

A night parking permit costs 
$1.00 for a weekday evening, $2.00 
for a Saturday or Sunday if pur-
chased between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., 
and $1.00 for a Saturday or Sunday 

registered students are $10 for a 
month, $15 for a quarter, and $40 
per year. 

Umstead said the average daily 
income from oight parking fees on 
weekdays during the summer was 
$370. He anticipates the income 
will be three or four times as much 
per night now that school is in 
session. 

To help enforce the new park-
ing regUlations, two parking atten-
dants are stationed at each of the 
nine entrances to UCSD in the 
evenings, said Qeo Phillips, spe-
cialeventscoordinatorofthePark-
ing and Transportation Depart-
ment. 

The attendants, who will be 
stationed at the entrances indefi-
nitely, sell parking permits, ex-
plain the new parking regulations, 
and offer directions, Phillips said

UC Davis Faces Lawsuit 

A group of Davis residents has filed a lawsuit against 
UCD for allegedly failing to comply with the California 
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in the final draft of 
the UC Davis Long Range Development Plan (LRDP) 
and its accompanying Environmental Impact Repon. 

Among the alleged faults that the West Davis Commu-
nity Association cited as reasons for the lawsuit are 
inadequate descriptions of possible altematives to proj-
ects outlined in the LRDP; inadequate analysis of envi-
ronmental impacts on the biological resources of UCD; 
and failure to identify or analyze potential air-quality 
impacts on a Tegional scale and sufficiently long-term 
basis. 

The group is also asking the the Superior Court of 
Alameda County to enact a provision of CEQA that 
would require the dispute to be resolved within 120 days 
after the lawsuit was filed.

Former Astronaut To 
Head UCSD Cal Space

astronaut and went on to hold vari-
ous administrative positions in that

Contributing Writer 

Forrnerastronaut Dr. Sally Ride, 
America's first woman in space, 
was recently appointed director of 
the California Space hstitute at 
Scripps Institution of Oceanogra-
phy and as a professor of physics at 
UCSD. 

Professor lames Arnold, the 
founding directorofthe California 
Space Institute (Cal Space), is re-
linquishing the directorship in order 
to spend more time on rus research 
and teaching. According to Ar-
nold, the change in leadership will 
occur "sometime in the next few 
weeks." 

Cal Space, created in 1979 by 
the Califomia legislature and head-
quartered at Scripps, is a $3.3 
million research institute that co-
ordinates and initiates work in 
space-related research among the 
UC campuses. Its main areas of 
investigation are climatology, 
robotics, propulsion systems, and 
other space sciences. 

"Cal Space is a program that's 
almost made to order for one with 
Ride's capabilities," said Deputy 
Director of Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography (SIO) Marvin 
Moss. 

Moss characterized Dr. Ride as 
an "outstanding individual" with 
"impeccable credentials in the

Dr. Ride received a doctorate 
in physics at Stanford University 
in 1978. Her research in physics 
has dealt primarily with free-elec-
tron lasers. She has also published 
articles on arms control and space 
policy. 

During 1978-79 she was a part-
time adjunct professor of space 
science at Rice University and an 
astronaut candidate with the Na-

year term ended on July I of this 
year. 

"Dr. Ride has made significant 
contributions to a number of major 
studies in space policy, space trans-
ponation, the Soviet space program, 
and the role of microgravity mate-
rials research in space," Director of 
SIO Edward Frieman said. 

PARKING: Night Fees 
Go Into Effect at UCSD 

"As Scripps Institution and Cal 
Space move fuither into aJe8S of 
global change and global climate 
studies ... Dr. Ride will no doubt 
be a key person in these effons," 
Frieman concluded. 

Dr. Ride's appointment as di-
rector of Cal Space comes at a time 
of growth for the institute. NASA 
has just designated Cal Space as 
one of 17 space grant colleges to 
receive funds for the development 
'of new programs, teaching materi-
als, and research in the space sci-
ences. As director of Cal Space, Dr. 
Ride will have authority to approve 
grants. 

Continued from pap 1 
opponunity to purchase a permit," 
he said. 

A.S. Vice President Adminis-
trative Alex Wong said he is wor-
ried about the new regulations' 
effect on attendance at nighttime 
activities at UCSD and expressed 
concem about safety. 

Wong wondered whether pa-
trons of activities at UCSD are 
"going to buy a permit and park on 
campus, or not come at all, or are 
they going to park off campus?" 

People who park off campus 10 
avoid paying for parking may face 
safety hazards at night walking to 
campus, Wong added. 

Umstead said he "disagreed" 
with worries about safety, saying 
thai theTe is not much space off 
campus to park in, and that night 
permits are inexpensive. 

"Where can you go downtown 
and pay $1 a night?" he asked. 

Umstead also pointed out that 
having "more parking people 
around at night than theTe were in 
the past" will help make parking 
on campus safer. 

He added that $400,000 has 
been spent over the last two years 
to upgrade lighting in campus 
parking lots. 

UCSD Lieutenant J. Dyer 
agreed that having the parking at-
tendants working on campus at 
night increases security. 

"Any time we have moTe eyes 
and ears that helps us," he said. 

However, Dyer said it was "too 
soon to teU" statistically whether 
the attendants have helped to re-
duce crime on campus. 

Dyer added that if more people 
parked on the periphery of campus 
to avoid parking fees then more 
police cars would be likely to pa-
trol those areas. Dyer maintained 
that on-campus parking would still 
be safer, because "the farther away 
you get, the less frequently you're 
going to get viewed" by passing 
police patrols. 

The new parking fees have not 
been met with enthusiasm by stu-
dents. 

Mathematics graduate student 
David Tao wondered where the 
new fees are going. 

"I have no idea what they aTe 
doing with the money," he said, 
adding that he was concerned about 
the safety of those who will park 
off campus at night in order to 
avoid paying parking fees. 

Third senior Bretley Danner 
questioned the timing of the in.ro-
duction of the new fees. 

"I think it's jus. another politi-
cal bullshit move by the admini-
stration, [implementing the fees] 
during the summer when people 
aren' t here to pro.est," she said. 

''The thrust and the direction of 
Cal Space will be under the aegis of 
Dr. Ride," said Moss. 

Professor Arnold said the Uni-
versity had several objectives in 
hiring the fonner astronaut both as 
a physics professor and as director 
of Cal Space. 

She will "not only be a very 
good addition to our faculty in 
herself, but certainly she will also 
be somebody who could be a pres-
ence so far as s.udents are con-
cerned, and so far as the commu-
nity is concerned," Arnold said. 

Dr. Ride's selection process 
began with discussions between 
administration members, the chair 
of the physics department and 
Professor Arnold. A faculty senate 
committee on academic personnel 
then reviewed Dr. Ride's record 
and sent its confidential findings to 
Chancellor Richard Atkinson, who 
approved the appointment. 

"Dr. Ride's contributions to .he 
nation's space program and space 
policy are truly significant:· At-
kinson said. "I can think of no one 
better suited to lead Cal Space into 
the next decade and beyond."

According to Kevin Haughian,

The task force, to be com-

The San Diego State University 
Publications Authority Board de-
cided last week that the editor in 
chief of the SDSU Daily Aztec 
would no longer have the sole voice 
in determining the newspaper's ad 
policy. 

A controversy began in August, 
when Daily Aztec Editor in chief 
Jon Petersen sent a letter to adver-
tisers which said the newspaper 
would no longer accept abonion 
service ads. 

The Daily Aztec does, however, 
accept advenising for phone sex 
companies and research paper 
suppliers. 

Petersen felt thaI because abor-
tion is taking " the life of an unborn 
human being," abortion service ads 
would violate the newspaper's 
written policy not to carry adver-
ti sing thaI serves "primarily to 
oppress the rights of a cenain group 
as determined by the editor in 
chief." 

Petersen's decision created 
heated controversy. Womancare, 

a local health clinic, recently with-
drew its ads and sent letters to 
Daily Aztec advertisers telling them 
of Petersen's decision and urging 
them to take . action should 
Petersen's policy be allowed to 
continue. 

On August 23, the SDSU Pub-
lications Authority Board (PAB), 
which acts as the Daily Aztec's 
publisher and reviews its editorial 
policy, declined to approve the 
advenising policy on which Pe-
tersen based his authority to ban 
the abortion service ads. 

"There' s never been an ap-
proved [advenising] policy," said 
Rick Moore, a member of the P AB 
and communications director at 
SDSU. 

However, the board, which is· 
made up of administrators , faculty 
and students. did not formulate a 
new policy at the August 23 meet· 
ing, so Petersen's ban remained in 
effect. 

Last Wednesday the PAB, by a 
vote of 10-0, approved a subcom-
minee recommendation that the 
advertising policy of the Daily Az-
tec be determined by a new adver-

tising policy committee made up 
of the editor in chief, managing 
editor, the two city editors, opin-
ion editor, advertising manager, 
and assistant advertising manager 
of the newspaper. The advenising 
policy of this board, however, must 
meet the approval of the PAB. 

"The ball is now back in the 
coun of the Daily Aztec staff," 
Moore said, noting that the com-
mittee must form a new advenis-
ing policy by Sept. 29. Mean-
while, Petersen's ban on aoonion 
ads remains in effect. 

Daily Aztec staff members ex-
pressed their approval of the P AB' s 
decision, and said the new adver-
tising policy committee may still 
side with Petersen's abonion ad 
ban. 

The PAB's decision is "some-
thing I'm in favor of... It lets us 
decide what we want to do," Daily 
Aztec Managing Editor Anthony 
Millican said 

He added that the upcoming 
vote of the new committee on 
whether to continue the ban on 
abortion ads will be close, and could 
"go either way." 

Daily Aztec City Editor Adrian 
Vore also supported the PAB's 
decision, because policy-making 
"is still in our hands." 

However, Vore said he was con-
cerned about the prospect of an ad-
vertising OOycon because of the 
abortion ad prohibition. 

"Not everyone on the Aztec staff 
suppons the [abortion ad ban] 
decision ... or even cares about iI," 
he said. 

The Guardian was unable to 
reach Petersen for comment. 

Editor's Note: 
It is the policy of the Guard· 
ian to accept all ads except 
those which are deemed 
extremely offensive. In the 
case of a questionable ad, the 
editorial board members and 
the advenising manager 
decide together whether to 
accept it, weighing the of-
fensiveness of the ad againsl 
the adveniser' s right to free 
speech. 

The Guardian does accept 
abonion clinic advertising.

Parking at UCSD 

Bring on the Night 
UCSD students are returning to campus to find the already bad 

parking situation has gotten much worse. Two major discoveries 
await them: the first is the hiking of the price of a student parking 
permit from $144 per year to $171. The second is the implemen-
tation of nighttime and weekend parking fees. 

The first is a fmancial inconvenience; it means writing a larger 
"UC Regents" check. The second is more serious. 

The University has to deal with the issue of the supply of 
parking. Multi-level parking structures should have already been 
built; instead, they are still in the crude planning stage. New 
parking lots were built behind the Warren Apartments last year; 
why wasn't a parking structure built there? It certainly couldn't 
be argued that a structure would ruin the beauty of the Apart-
ments. Moreover, it's likely that one ofthe lots will be replaced 
with the Warren dorms, reducing the amount of parking further . 
If the higher fees were going directly to construction of new 
parking, they'd be a bit more tolerable. 

The long-range plan is to have very little parking on campus, 
with shuttles bringing students from distant lots ringing UCSD. 
This may be the only feasible solution, but it raises another 
problem if nighttime parking regulations are retained. 

Nighttime parking isn't a very good idea now, and it's only 
likely to get worse. Most students won't feel too inconvenienced 
at first - after all, the regular student permit is valid 24 hours a 
day . . But then they'll begin to notice things: programming will 
suffer, because people who come on campus to see a concert or 
speaker will have the added cost and inconvenience of buying a 
$1 permit for the night. Then students will notice that the ability 
to park at a metered space close to where they want to go is gone 
- meters demand money at night now too. 

For example, going to the Price Center at night now means 
either feeding a meter, or parking far away in a student lot and 
walking. Walking through the dark UCSD campus. 

Which raises the most important argument against nighttime 
parking: safety. Aside from the problem for students with 
permits, those students who can't afford permits or meters will 
continue to park off campus and walk - but now they'll have to 
do it at night too. This is a real danger for women, but it also 
endangers men. Unless they park right next to a pay phone, they 
probably won't be able to call a Community Service Officer to 
escon them - and CSOs don't go off campus anyway. 

Parking Services argues that the higher number of their people 
on campus will increase safety, but it is doubtful this will be 
enough to protect students put in jeopardy by the new regulations. 
How much money will the University have to make to decide that 
safety isn't important? Not much, apparently. 

In fact, it is uncertain how profitable nighttime parking will be. 
This year, it isn't likely to make much money. This is because 
A.S. President John Ramirez and Vice President Administrative 
Alex Wong were able to negotiate with the administration to keep 
night permit prices low for a year. Ramirez ca1led it "a pretty good 
win, at least for this year," but both Ramirez and Wong stressed 
that next year prices for night permits will either go a lot higher 
(exacerbating all the problems mentioned above), or the regula-
tions will be scrapped. 

It's clear what the decision should be, but if the University 
discovers a lot of money is to be made here, it is unlikely the spirit 
of compromise Ramirez and Wong found will continue. 

The administration mcst make parking a high priority, and 
must slash through the red tape to make an equitable, safe and 
effective parking policy. It may pain the administration to let 
people who park at night get away without paying (and it is a bit 
unfair to those who only come here during the day) , but the costs 
in terms of less successful programming, reduced safety and 
increased inconvenience are just too high.

A Glimmer in Grandfather 
By SETH SLATER, 

Edilor in CIWI 
I remember when my grandfa-

ther, just a few shon years ago, 
pulled me aside in his den and 
handed me an old, but well-pre-
served wooden map of the world 
while whispering in a conspirato-
rial tone not to let Grandma see. 

He explained that his spouse for 
over 50 years had been making 
him throw out some of the many 
precious knickknacks he had sal-
vaged from sidewalk garbage bins 
over the years and he thought we 
might at least save the map if I 
could manage 10 smuggle iI, unno-

ticed, out of his apanment and into 
my parents' garage. 

1l1ere was something mildly 
playful about his manner and it 
was apparent that he was taking 
delight in this little game of cat-
and-mouse. Needless to say,l felt 
privileged to be chosen for his 
mission and was glad to help. 

When my grandparents came to 
our house later that week, I took 
him out to the garage to show him 
the place where I'd hung the map. 
We chuckled together, quietly, in a 
secret salute to the success of our 
little ruse.

Aborting Abortion Advertising 
By ANDREA ADLEMAN, Features Editor 

Who the hell does he think he is? This was my 
first reaclion after reading thaI a peerof mine, a fellow 
student and journalist, banned abortion advertising 
from San Diego State University 'S newspaper, the 
Daily Aztec. 

Jon Petersen, the paper's editor, has allowed a 
personal belief to make a professional and ethical 
decision for him. In the process, he has made a moral 
judgement for each and every woman who reads the 
Daily Aztec. 

Thank you for being so "concerned," Mr. Pe-
tersen, but we are quite capable of making that deci-
sion for ourselves. 

The Aztec's advenising pot icy states that an 
advenisement "cannot serve primarily to oppress the 
right of a certain group as detennined by the editor in 
chief." Petersen has extended the passage to include 
what he sees as the rights of the fetus and feels he is 
thus protecting the unborn by prohibiting abonion 
referral services from advertising in the Aztec. 

His aclions are completely out of line. One indi-
vidual simply cannot make such a profound decision 
even before the Supreme Coun. the wise and vener-
able institution that it is, has cast a final verdict on this 
issue. 

Petersen is concerned about the rights of the un-
born, the fetus. Aren't the rights of people living now 
-- women -- jusl a little more important? 

Fortunately, someone else has questioned 
Petersen's judgement as well. SDSU's Publications 
Authority Board has been pondering the issue for 
several weeks. Last Wednesday , the board decided to 
set up a board of members of the Aztec staff to make 
the decision. 

But, that really isn't the issue here. The larger 
picture involves reproductive autonomy, which is 
much more than a catch-phrase. What many people 
fail to realize is that a precedent of restricting wome.n's 
rights could potentially be set here. 

As women, we are working to gain equal treatment 
in all aspects of life. Reproductive autonomy is the 
key to our success or failure. If we cannot control our 

own bodies, where does thaI leave us? Thinking about 
the possibility that a group of politicians (who will, of 
course, be mostl y men) could get logether and restrict 
or outlaw abonion frankly disgusts me. 

As UC scholar Krislin Luker emphasizes in Abor-
tion and the Politics of Motherhood, the abortion 
issue is ultimately about the role of women in society. 
lust think aboul the tille, the juxlaposition of abonion 
and the politics of motherhood. Changing the tradi-
lional ideas of motherhood is a main component of the 
feminist movement; we endeavor 10 be able to decide 
when and if we want to become mothers. Cenain 
powerful and conservative segments of society wish 
to make that decision for us. 

A question: How many other countries are debal-
ing the issue so deeply as ours? 

In many countries, it is a non-issue. A Swedish 
friend once told me that binh control is readily avail-
able to women and girls and that her father bought her 
the pill when she was 15. People in Ihose countries 
must look at the catfighting that is going on here and 
laugh. Indeed it is laughable, not to mention embar-
rassing, to be arguing about the abortion issue. 

For all of the aforementioned reasons, I feel it is 
ludicrous 10 be arguing about something that is clearly 
each woman's decision. 

I have tried to be open-minded and understand Ihe 
opposing viewpoint. As Luker repons , the overwhelm-
ing difference dividing Ihe sides is Ihat pro-lifers are 
religious in one way or another, and pro-choice activ-
ists are not. 

By pushing for an end to abonion, the pro-life 
people are saying that their way, based on lheir 
beliefs, is the right way for everyone. By virtue of the 
definition of their title, the pro-choice groups want to 
leave the decision to each individual woman. 

The right-to-lifers are motivated by an entirely dif-
ferent set of circumstances than the pro-choice people. 
The groups are comprised of different people with 
different backgrounds making personal judgements 
based on those backgrounds. 

I can't help but ask why that is so hard for the right-
to-life people to ac~t.

GLIMMER 
Continued from page 6 

Despite his years, the aged man 
my grandmother sometimes affec-
tionately calls "The Trickster" 
possessed a playfully mischievous 
spirit in those days, but time has 
taken its toU and there are few 
outward signs of that spirit now. 

During a recent 87th binhday 
dinner, I watched my grandfather's 
unsure hands struggle in vain to 
unwrap his gift from the family, a 
sweater with a pair of pajamas. 

My grandmother had to help 
him get through the wrapping and 
open the box, but he did manage, 
with a vacant stare and slurred 
speech, to express his thanks. His

voice was a near monotone and his 
words sounded like a taped mes-
sage played back in response to a 
situation vaguely recognized, but 
not fully understood. 

At the restaurant, my grandfa-
ther sat at the head of the table in 
his wheelchair and was largely 
ignored by the family. Our lack of 
anention toward him was nOl in-
tended as a slight, nor did he seem 
to perceive it as one. 

The fact is, in recent months my 
grandfather has been closing in on 
himself as part of a steady retreat 
from the world or, perhaps more 
accurately, from life. He doesn't 
seem to perceive much of anything 
these days and probably didn't even 
notice that he was left out of the 
conversation. 

More of a psychological de-
fense mechanism than a slight, the 
distancing of ourselves from my 
grandfather has grown out of a 
strange sense of awkwardness 
which no one in our family speaks 
about, but which Ithink weall feel. 
Maybe when we look at the aging 
body that we still associate with a 
personality, we don't know how 
we should feel or what to say. 
Maybe, in some odd way, we are 
embarrassed by our own discom-
fon or, despite a guilt-tinged un-
easiness, by his waning person-
hood. 

As I sat at the dinner table con-
templating the irony of celebrating 
a binhday under such circum-
stances, I turned toward my grand-
father, who was staring off at a far 
comer of the room. 

I was surprised and somewhat 
startled to see a momentary flicker 
of brightness in his eyes as he 
glanced in my direction and smiled, 
vaguely, with raised eyebrows. It 
was a glance eerie in its fleeting-
ness and, since then, I haven't been 
able to stop wondering whether 
the map-smuggling grandfather I 
remember is really gone or not. 

I don't really know where the 
energy for that twinkJing glimmer 
of brightness in my grandfather's 

~yes came from or what caused it 
to surface or, even, what it meanL 

I like to think of mYiClf as a 
writer, both of fact and fiction, but 
I'm not sure what story I'm trying 
to tell here. Maybe I would if I 
knew what that old man's bright-
ness was trying to say.

Library 
Ucdates 
C eck-out 
By RANDY OOTINGA 
StaffWr;t~r 

The UCSD library system is 
convening to an automated check-
out system, which will save library 
patrons time when borrowing 
books. 

The new Innopac computer 
system was inaugurated at the 
Science and Engineering Library 
in April. Central Library began 
using the system in August, and 
the Humanities Under~raduate 
Library will become fully opera-
tional under the new program 
within the next month, according 
to Ginny Steel, head of Access 
Services at Central Library. 

UCSDS favorite and original pizzeria says 
WELCOME BACK S I UDEN 151 

This year's pledge to you from B.J. i': 
In order to use the system, a 

borrower must first be registered, 
Steel said. 

• The BEST deep dish pizza in the area 
• Fresh pastas 

Library users can register by 
filling out a form available at the 
libraries, whicharnongotherthings 
asks whether the user wishes to 
waive confidentiality rights. If the 
rights are waived, a borrower's 
address and telephone number will 
be made available to others who 
are interested in the material that 
has been checked out. 

• Top quali1¥ sand\Niches 
• Cold beer and wines 
• Speedy and FREE student delivery 
• Great atmosphere, friendly service

Once registered into the com-
puter, a borrower needs only to 
present a current ID card in order 
to check out a book, Steel said. 
Library workers will then use the 
computerized check -out system to 
scan bar codes on the ID card and 
on the material to be checked out.

liThe outside world's needs have 
a large impact on what is taught in 
the University," Gordon said. 

Professor Laurence Milstein of 
the ECE department at UCSD said 
"if the recommendations appear to 
emphasize short-term technology 
trends, then they would only have 
minimal effect. However, if the 

evaluation uncovers long-term 
trend changes in high-technology, 
then the recommendations would 
possibly be helpful to the uni versi-
ties . 

"The role of the university is 
nOI to train students in the hottest 
or newest trends in engineering, 
but to give students a good founda-
tion in the basics of math and engi-
neering," Milstein concluded. 

Campus construction sites were areas of activity throughout the summer.

"My opinion is that it's a na-
tionaI problem, but not one at 
UCSD," Bowden said. 

Lopez explained that hazing "ia 
not really bad at UCSD, but other 
[chapter) systems have been around 
for a long time and have a loe of 
hazing traditions that So way back." 

Another n:ason cited by TKE 
for ellrninatina pledains was the 
high cost ofliability insurance. By 
eliminating hazing, injury acci-
dents are leas likely to occur, and 
the cost of inaunmc:e for the frater-
nity is lowered significantly. 

Dean-Ross Schessler, TKE 
alumnus and regional vice presi-
dent for the fraternity, termed this 
"risk. management." 

Both Petralia and Lopez, how-
ever, fecI that their chapters will 
benefit from the policy in more 
ways than just eliminating poten-
tial hazing and insurance risk. 

Petralia predicted that "new 
members will be more excited 
about the fraternity and more will-
ing to learn about the history and 
the things about the fraternity" now 
that hazing has been abolished. 

The two fraternities will replace 
their pledge education programs 
with more extensive education 
programs that will involve all fra-
ternity members. 

According to Schessler, theedu-
cation program replacing pledge 
education will raise the academic 
standard of TKE 'chapters. 

"Before, the fraternity did not 
have a minimum standard for its 
members" in academic terms, ex-
plained Schessler. 

"This was left to the individual 
chapCcr to set. Now we've put a 
floor on it," he said 

1bere is some speculation in 
the Greckcommunity that thismay 
be the stan of a trend amona frater-
nities to abolish pledgina. just lIS 
dry rush policies have been a trend 
across the nation's campuses in 
the past few years. ZBT and TKE 
are confident that other fraternities 
will follow their lead. 

Other fraternities "have asked 
for samples of our program and the 
insight that we bad in developing 
that program," said Adcock.. 

Petralia predicted that within 
two to tbrcc years 90 percent of 
national fraternities will have fol-
lowed ZBT and TKE's lead in 
ending pledging. 

Bowden said that while some 
fraternities will definitely abolish 
pledging, he feels that many frater-
nities will retain their pledge pro-
grams. 

Bowden said he would still like 
rushees to have the option to join a 
fraternity which offers a pledge 
program if they so 'choose. 

"Believe it or not, a lot of people 
who pledge fraternities want to go 
through a pledge period," Bowden 
explained. 

Bowden added that he believes 
pledging is an issue that's going to 
have to be handled "from frater-
nity to fraternity." 

Both ZBT and TKE are confi-
dent that they have made the right 
move. 

"The fraternity ' s focus these 
days is on brotherhood, not esoter-
ics. This program is going to work," 
concluded Petralia.

Three Ways to Extend Beyond the Classroom 
Get a Job ... 

By RENEE LEWIS 
Contributing Writer 

In light of high rent, increasing 
registration fees and parking per-
mit costs, as well as numerous 
other living expenses, more and 
more students at UCSD are faced 
with the decision of whether or 
notto get a job. 

When making this decision, 
several questions must be consid-
ered. Will working take up so 
much time that studying becomes 
almost impossible? Will it leave 
students completely without a so-
ciallife? 

While students who work agree 
that there are inconveniences to 
working and going to school at the 
same time, many feel that the bene-
fits outweigh the drawbacks. 

Monica Corum is a Fifth Col-
lege sophomore who works part-
time doing word processing and 
clerical work for the Psychology 
Service at the Veterans Admini-
stration Medical Center. She feels 
that working has forced her to be 
disciplined. but acknowledges that 
her job is time-consuming. 

"One drawback I see is that, a 
lot of times ... 1 have to schedule 
classes and I also have to schedule 
work and that doesn ' t leave a lot 
of time for meeting with TAs or 

professors or for doing activities. 
If I wasn't working then I would 
have a lot more free time. 

"But, it 's also good, too, be-
cause when I work, it forces me to 
have a tight schedule and it makes 
me study more," Corum contin-
ued. "People think that because 
you work, you don't get to study 
enough. If you know that you're 
really tight for time, you're going 
to use those hours that you have 
and use them well." 

'When I work, it 
forces me to have 
a tight schedule 
and it makes me 
study more.'

Contributing Writ". 

W bDarctheRepntsand what 
do they do? Considerina thai al-
most every check a student writes 
on my UC campus is to the UC 
Relents, many students would 
probably say the Repnts spend all 
the money the Univcnity of 00-
fomiagets. 

The truth is that the Regents 
actually do spend mosl of the 
money gained by the University, 
but they also serve a number of 
other functions. 

Article IX, Section 9 of 
California's constitution states: 
"The University of California shall 
constitute a public trust known as 
'The Regents of the University of 
California,' with full powers of 
orgmization and government sub-
ject only to such legislative control 
as may be necessary to insure 
compliance with the tenns of the 
endowments of the Univcnity and 
the security of its funds. " 

Primarily, the Regents is a board 
which governs the University and 
maintains the financial security of 
aU its campuses. 

To accomplish this task, the 
board currently consists of 28 
Regents. Seven are ex-officio 
members, 20 arc appointed mem-
bers, and one is the student regent 

Ex-officio members automati-
cally become regents because of 
the offices they hold in the Stale 
government. These members in-
clude the governor, the Iieutenmt 
governor, the speaker of the AIr 
sembly, the Stale superintendent of 
public instruction, the president of 
the Alumni Association, the vice 

According to Cali· 
fornia's constitu· 
tion, the Regents 
are 'a public trust 
•.• with full powers 
of organization 
and government.' 

• Article IX, Section 9 
president of the Alumni Associa-
tion, and the president of the Uni-
versity. 

Appointed members are cho-
sen by the governor and approved 
by the state senate. 1bc student 
regent is the only regent who is 
approved by the Boerd of Regents 
itself. 

There is no seniority associaled 
with the different types of mem-
bership. All regents, including the 
studentregenl, have the same rights 
and privileges. 

The Regents receive no pay; 

STUDENT PACKAGE 

thus, the Regents gain no financial 
beoefit from any of the transac-
tions they make on behalf of the 
University . 

"[Being • regent] is strictly a 
public service job ... the only pay-
ments received are for expenses 
and transponation 10 and from the 
. meetings, "said Oair BWJcner, an 
appointed regenL 

The Regents meet nine times 
each year, during every month 
excepl April, August and Decem-
ber, and most meetings are open to 
the public. All the decisions made 
by the Regents are handled during 
the meetings. 

Meetings are two-day events . 
1be first day consists of commit-
tee meetings, in which issues are 
discussed in detail. The committee 
meetings are scheduled through-
out the day in order to allow all the 
Regents to attend every one. 

During the second day of the 
meetings, all issues which the 
committees discussed are voted 
upon. Thus, all the Regents under-
stand each issue when it is brought 
up in front of the board to be voted 
upon. 

"[When voting], you don't have 
to wonder what the committee dis-
cussed," Burgener stated. "You 
were there for the whole thing. 

"1be general oversight over the 
University and all its nine cam-
puses is handled primarily by the 
conunitteesystan," said Burgener. 

There are also several special-
committees. For example, the 
Committee on Affirmative Action 
is a special committee which pro-
motes non-<iiscriminatory prac-
tices, making sure the University 
remains an equal opportunity 
employer. 

''The Regents own and operate 
the University on behalf of the 
taxpayer. Nobody really owns it 
except the people of California," 
Burgener said. "(The Regents) are 
responsible to the state legislature, 
the people of California, and the 
go,enuuent in general." 

Even though the Regents oper-
ate the University, they do not 
decide every issue that arises. 

"I guess the reason the Univer-
sity works at all is because it is de-
centralized to a very large extent," 
said Burgener. "Each chancellor

on each campus has a great deal of 
autonomy, and they don't have to 
call the [University) President's 
Office every time a decision must 
be made." 

The Regents may not actually 
make all the decisions concerning 
each campus, but they must ap-
prove all fees which affect the stu-
dents. 

"All registration or education 
fees have to be approved by the 
Regents." said Paul West, a spokes-
person fonhe University Office of 
the President. "Also, things like 
parking fees which directly affect 
students and pertain to the running 
of the campus" must be approved 
by the Regents. 

The Regents must also manage 
the stocks and bonds which the 
University owns. These stocks are I 
typically donated. "The state does 
not give [the University) money to 
buy investments with, nor does the 
federal government," Burgener 
said. 

The University does make a 
profit from the stocks. Some of the 
profit is reinvested into other 
stocks. 

But, much of the profit gener-
ated is used fonile University. "A 
lot of the money the University has 
in stocks and bonds ... creates an 
endowment to help ope.rate the 

~EVERY 1st 6: 

f 
University," West said. 

TIle endowment can be distrib-
uted to such things as the contin-
gency fund, for things which are 
not budgeted by the University, or 
the University Employee Retire-
ment Benefit Fund. 

Recendy, sources of the endow-
ment drew disapproval from stu-
dents; a portion of the endowment 
was being supplied by profits 
generated from investments in 
South Africa, a country whose 
govenunent practices institution-

alized racial discrimination. 
Though the funds generated by 
these investments were to help 
the University, many students felt 
that the University should break 
any support or affiliation with the 
South African govenunent. 

Protests were organized cam-
puswide to express this opinion. 
These protests helped influence 
the Regents' decision to withdraw 
their investments from South 
Africa. 

~est can be an effective 

means of expressing an opinion, 
but there are other ways for stu-
dents to make their views known 
to the Regents.

she may express this opinion to the 
Board during the meeting. 

The secretary of the Regents is 
not a regent, but it is this person's 
job to make sure that all legitimate 
correspondence is distributed to 
the Regents. 

It is possible for one to appear 
at a Regents' meeting to speak be-
fore the Board. This process in-
volves many steps, however, at the 
end of which Ihere is no guarantee 
that the person will actually be 
called upon to address the Regents.

With its commitment to multicultural educaUon, 
UCSO's Teacher Education Program strives to provide the 
prospective teacher with the abUity to recognize the 
unique herttage of different cultures and the importance 
of preserving each student's cultural identtty whUe 
providing them with the sldlls necessary to move between 
cuhural systems. Multicultural education places equal 
emphasis on each student's developmentally acquired 
ability to learn, and provides the prospective teacher with 
insight into the complex relationships between language, 
culture, human development and educaUOn. 

Our program is unique in CalifOrnia in its emphasis 
and commitment to multi-cultural and bilingual 
education; and with the commitment and personal 
attention given by our faculty, 'IEP graduates are provided 
with diverse experience and a solid foundation in 
teaching. UCSD TEP students are often hired into 
permanent Jobs as they finish their final student teaching 
assignments.

school called the Children' s 
School ofPerfonning Arts Acad-
emy. 

"For my particular job, it's 
something that I enjoy, working 
with kids, so it's more of arelaxa-
lion time," Oh explained. "Juakes 
my mind off of school and other 
things that worry me. It's also a 
good experience for me for later 
on." 

For students like Warren s0-
phomore Kimberly Thomas, a 
part-time employee of Wendy's 
in the Price Center, working is a 
matter of necessity: "I work be-
cause I'm on financial aid and I 
need the eXIra money to pay for 
registration and housing." 

"Plus, I enjoy working, "added 
Thomas, who explained that 
working fulfills certain personal 
as well as financial needs. "J don't 
feel like [1m doing what I'm sup-
posed to if I'm not working. Oth-
erwise,ljust feel likeI'm wasting 
my time." 

Thomas cited fatigue as one of 
the most significant drawbacks to 
herjob. 

"After a while, you could pos-
sibly get burnt out because you do 
get tired from not having enough 
free time to just go and-visit your 
friends and stuff like that," Tho-
mas said. 

Students who wOtt on campus 
seemed to agree that their jobs 
paid bener, were more accessible 
(especially if they worked in-be-
tween classes), and were more 
flexible in tenns of scheduling 
wolk around classes. 

''The whole thinking [aJ on-
campus jobs] is towards students 
and research and learning" Corum 
added "It's just a better atmos-
phere." 

On the other hand, Revelle s0-
phomore 10celyn Poblete has an 
off-campusjob with which she is 
very satisfied. While.she admit-
ted that her pay might be "slightly 
less" than that of on-campus jobs, 
she stated that "the hours are 
really flexible and workable with 
my schedule." 

For students who are seeking 
employment, the Career Services 
Center (CSC) on campus is the 
tirst place 10 stan. 1bere students 
can rand lists of both on- and off-
campus positions available. 

"We estimate that there are ap-
proximately 4,000 students em-
ployed on campus," said Christine 
Alexander, a student affairs offi-
cer for part-time employment at 
CSC. 

According to Alexander, the 
jobs available at CSC "range from 
the mundane, such as dishwashers 
... to computer programrners. " 

The facts aftinn that on-campus 
jobs pay more: the range for on-
campus jobs is $4.60 to $12 per 
hour whereas the minimum wage 
off-campusis$4.25 per hour. 
"The opening of the Price Center 

"has given us more on- and off-
campus jobs," Alexander said. 
"Even though the Price Center is 
physicall y located on campus,the 
private employers [such as) 
Wendy's and Espresso Roma ... 
are all considered off-campus 
employers. They do hire students, 
however, and they pay well ... 

esc is open weekdays from 8 
a.m. to 4:30 p.m.

hospital visits. 

For people who want to give to 
the community just for the good in 
it, Children ' s Hospital has 
"Children's Line 10," which in-
volves a three-hour per week 
commitment to talk over the phone 
after school with kids who are 
scared of being alone at home, 
having trouble with homework, or 
just want to talk. 

TIle Rescue Mission in down-
town San Diego endeavors to re-
duce homelessness in the area. The 
Mission is run by the 100 men in its 
rehabilitation program.which ac-
cepts men with any problem, not 
necessarily drug or alcohol addic-
tion. 

meals, job-search assistance, and 
religious and academic teaching. 

Although the facility currently 
provides emergency overnight 
shelter for men only, anyone is 
welcome to a free, hot meal as long 
as he or she attends the required 
one-hour chapel service before-
hand. 

The Rescue Mission requests a 
six-month commitment of its 
kitchen volunteers. The Mission 
accepts donations of all kinds as 
well, including food, clothing, soap 
and bedding. 

For persons wi~ little free time 
to volunteer, one-day events are an 
easy way to give time to the com-
munity. Whether it be a 10K run, 
charity ball, the Special Olympics, 
or donating blood, most agree all 
efforts are for the bettennent of the 
community and worth the time they 
take.

One of Monica Corum's duties at the Veteran's Administration 
Medical Center is word processing. 

The entire center is maintained

want at the mission, as well as

Volunteers 
Continued from ... 15 
during the past four or five years," 
stated Tom Tucker. assistant vice 
chancellor of undergraduate af-
fairs, who coordinates campus 
volunteer activities. 

During the 1~81 scbool ye., 
Human Core assembly bill 1820 
WIll pused. The bill ellCOUJ'l8e5 
California universities to promote 
the ethics of volunteerism, Al-
though Human Core Task Force 
was set up on campus. UCSD's 
driving force toward community 
service, the Volunteer Connection, 
had already been established. 

Together, statewide Human 
C9re groups created their defini-
tiOn of community service, 

It reads: "Community service 
is the work perfonned by under-
graduate and graduate students 
either voluntarily or for some form 
of compensation or academic credit 
through non-profit, government, 
orcommunity-based organization. 

"In general, such work should 
seek 10 improve the quality of life 
for disadvantaged and low-income 
community residents or to address 
social problems and enrich the 
quality of the educational experi· 
ence for the students 'who partici-
pate." 

In addition to the statewide 
Human Core, UCSD worts with 
SDSU and USD to fonn a kind of 
model consortium in which all the 
campuses'VolunteerConnections 
work to help get referrals for theiJ 
students and complete large proj-
ects together, In one recent proj-
ect, county-wide university volun-
teers painted an elementary school. 

The San Diego Volunteer Cen-
ter based at United Way serves as 
a link between the San Diego uni-
versities. 

The center is currently cftal-
lenging 15,000 San Diegans to 
become Volunteers, enough people 
to fill San Diego's Sports Arena. 
The project, which is being done in 
conjunction with KGTV channel 
10, is caIlcd "Volunteer 10." 

Cathy Booth is the coordinator 
for channel 10's program, whicb 
will run until April. She calls this 
project "one of the most exciting 
volunteer opportunities in San Di· 
ego."

were seniors Felicia Faro, Jenny 
Kingsbury, Teresa Schwaar, and 
sophomore Katy Dulock, who led 
the Tritons last year while setting a 
single season record with over 20 
individual goals. 

McManus said he expects a big 
year from all of them, including 
sophomore midfielder Kalyn Shea. 

On the other end of the field. 
McManus depends on Toni 
Krumme to anchor the defense. 
Krumme sat out Sunday's game 
with shin splints, but will return for 
Wednesday's match against Divi-
sion n UC Irvine. 

Other defensive duties lie with 
returning goalie Julie Freiss and 
sophomore defender Amy Wayte, 
who fills the hole left by two-time 
All-American Susan Kramer. 

Newcomers at midfield include 
Jodie Robertson, Jackie Melnik 
(whose brother plays on the UCSD 
men's soccer team), and Joanne 
DaLuz. 

McManus expects UCSD's 
biggest local challenges to come 
from Claremont and Cal State San 
Bernardino, whom the Tritons 
downed 3-0 in a hard-fought , 
physical battle on Friday,

Too Late - UC Davis goalie Mike Hirsch can't change gears fast enough to prevent Carrick Brewster's shot from going in during 
the first half of Friday's game. The Tritons went on to win, 2-1, and have since upped their overall record to 3-0-1 .

Some of Armstrong's impend-

"There's no question that our 
big goal is to win the WWPA," 
Harper said ...... and [ feel confi-
dent that we'l1 win it." 

The Tritons travel to Provi-
dence, Rhode Island, to compete 
in the Brown University Invita-
tional next weekend. 

Harper pointed out that a loss to 
any team in that invitational will 
deem the entire trip "unsuccess-
ful" for the Tritons. 

W. V-Ball 
continued from page 25 
nents, and Dannevik still believes 
this team has the potential to be 
better than last year's champion-
ship squad. 

"We're not as good now as we 
were at this time last year, but we 
are porl""rially a better team," 
Dannevik said. "We are a lot big-
ger and our blocking is much bet-
ter. Stil1, three things musrhappen 
or we won't be as good: Allison 
Hensleit must become a solid 
scorer, Becky Palmer and lenny 
Wellman must provide solid sup-
pon, and Linda Ross must im-
prove." 

Ross, a senior setter, takes over 
in much the same situation as for-
mer All-American setter Laurie 
Benanyi did a year ago: moving in 
as the team's starter despite having 
tittle previous experience as a 
backup to one of the team's stars. 
(Bertanyi took over for Carol Lip-
son, who was a member of three 
national championship teams.) 

Dannevik explained tlmt-ath-
letically, Ross is a talented player 
and has improved in every match 
the team has played. He added that 
her continued improvement is vi-
tal to the success of the squad. 

But the Tritons have yet to face 
any Division m opponents - and 
when they do-it witt probably be 
an entirely different story.

Cognitive science is the study of intelligence, human and artificial, real and 
abstract, from the individual neuron to a group. This new course explores 
classical and fundamental questions of mind and intelligence, including re-
lations among minds, brains, and computers. It may fulfill requirements for 
a minor or program of concentration in cognitive science, as well as general 
education requirements, but be sure to check with an academic adviser in 
your provost's office or with the Department of Cognitive Science.

Women's Volleyball Shoots 'El!' Us Sixth National Tale 
Can Dannevik Work His Magic a Fourth Time? 

By BRIAN ITOW 
Senior Staff Writer 

Anyone who thinks that four 
straight NCAA Division ill titles 
will be a cakewalk had betterchcck 
the recipe. 

Just a few days into PfllCtice, it 
became apparent that a fourth con-
secutive national title - and sixth 
overall - will not come easily for 
the Tritons. When second-team 
All-American left-side hitter Ra-
chel Vetter was sidelined for the 
season with a tom rotator cuff in-
jury, Head Coach Doug Dannevik's 
season-long game plan was thrown 
into disamlY. 

Instead of being a fine-tuned 
experienced machine gearing up 
for its title defense, the Tritons 
have struggled to find the right 
chemistry to replace the injured 
Vetter. 

Allison Hensleit, who had 
trained for the past two years as a 
right-side hitter, was moved to the 
left side. The right-side hitter posi-
tion has been filled by a platoon of 
Becky Palmer and Jennifer Well-
man. Palmer was moved to the 
outside from the middle blocker 
position, and Wellman had pri-
marily played as a backcourt spe-
cialist before the switch. 

All of this shifting around had a 
very unsettling effeCt on the 1989 
Triton squad. In its early-season 
games, the team has been inconsis-
tent in setting up its attack and has 
had a tough time putting points on 
the board. 

The Tritons have suffered 
through a tough early-season in 
which they have dropped a num-
ber of games to the scholarship-
offering NCAA Division I, n, and 
NAIA schools. 

UCSD (6-S) has fallen to such 
squads as Oregon State of the Pac-
10, NAIA National Champion 
Hawaii-Pacific, and Division II 
top-ranked and ninth-ranked Cal 
State Northridge and Cal State Bak-
ersfield, respectively. 

One element has remained in-
tact amid all the changes, how-
ever: Diana Klintworth, an All-
American last year who has played 
on three national champion Triton 
teams, continues to be the heart 
and soul of the team. 

The S '9" senior left-side hitting 
Klintworth, one of the most com-
plete players to come through the 
UCSD ranks, will lead the attack 
and provide impetus for the re-
building process. 

Klintworth will be flanked by 
middle blockers Elizabeth Tan and 
Beth Selby. 

Tan, a S '9" redshirt sophomore, 
is entering her second year as a 
starter. A quick player. Tan has the 
potential to be the best middle 
blocker in UCSD history, accord-
ing to Dannevik. 

Selby may not be the offensive 
force that Tan is, but Dannevik 
thinks she is the best blocker on the 
team. 

Despite having promise, the 
Tritons have been struggling and 
their confidence has consequently 
been waning in the early-going. 
However, they have yet to play any 
games apinst Division ill oppo-

Last year, UCSD's men's and 
women's cross country teams fin-
ished second at the Western Re-
gionals. This year, well, it's still 
early, but if the Cal State Fullerton

year's version of the Tritons should 
not have much of a problem im-
proving upon last year's finish.

weekend of Scp. 9, UCSO swept

women's college divisions with

Men's Water Polo Gears Up tor '89 season 

UCSD Sets Sights on NCAA's 
By PHIL GRUEN 
Sports Editor 

Usually, when a team-in any 
spon -loses its franchise player, 
it is forced to undergo a rebuilding 
year. 

UCSO'smen's waterpoloteam 
just lost its franchise player (two-
time All-American and UCSO Ath-
lete of the Year goalie Randy 
Franke) to graduation. So ... a re-
building year, right? 

Probably not. 
TIle UCSO men's water polo 

tradition is too deep to let the loss 
of a few players affect the entire 
team. Sure, Franke, along with 
scoring machine Dave "Buster" 
Calder and Tom Schatz will be 
missed, but this year's Tritons may 
be even stronger than last year's. 
Maybe. 

"TIle book on us is that we're 
strong in the field, fast, and big," 
Head Coach Denny Harper ex-
plained ...... But we didn't play 
anywhere near what we' re capable 
of in Santa Barbara. " 

In the UC SantaBarbara Gaucho 
Cup the weekend of Sep. 8-9, the 
Tritons finished third with a 4-1 
record. UCSDwould have rcached 
the title g8lllC had it not been for a 
poor defensive performance 
against the host Gauchos in the 

semifmals. 
Harper is hoping that a stronger, 

faster offense will take some of the 
pressure away from the defense by 
keeping the ball away from the 0p-
position. 

S.P. Beay, a lefthander who saw 
limited action as a goalie last sea-
son, will be replacing Franke. 
Harper pointed out that Beay is "a 
bit undetermined in the cage," but 
that he is a "great passer and com-
municator." 

The rest of the lineup features 
seniors Chris Carrillo, Peter 
McConville, Todd Sells, and Ja-
son Vance, in addition to juniors 
Jason "Turtle" Brown and Greg 
Goodrich. 

The addition of Goodrich, a 
lefthandcr, gives UCSD an added 
dimension in the field. Although 
many top scholarship schools have 
lefthandcrs on their rosters year 
after year, the Tritons rarely do. 

"Water polo is a game of 
angles," Harper said. "Having a 
lefthandcr helps balance the team 
out. " 

Other players who will sec 
plenty of action include senior 
Mike Schatz and sophomore 
Corbin Walburger. 

Even though UCSD finished 
among the top eight teams in the 
country last year, and eight teams 
are invited to the NCAA Ownpi-

Soccer Teams Resume Winning Ways 
Men Need to 
Overcome Injuries, 
Inexperience to 
Regain Title 
By DANA CHAIKEN 
Associate Spons Editor 

Despite being defending na-
tional champions and ranked near 
the top, the UCSD men's soccer 
team has been forced to start from 
the bottom this-year. - - - -

The team's early success (two 
victories to extend its consecutive 
winning streak to 28 dating back to 
last season) does not accurately re-
flect its off-season reconstruction. 

The defensive line, which Head 
Coach Derek Annstrong revealed 
as "vulnerable," has been com-
pletely revamped. Because of 
losses due to graduation and an in-
j ury to senior captain Mike Bra-
dley, the 3-0-1 Tri tons started three 
newcomers in Friday's 2-1 victory 
over the Division II UC Davis 
Aggies (0-4-1). 

Four Shutouts 
Prove That Women 
Are Still in Last 
Year's Top Fonn 
By DANA CHAlKEN 
Associate Sports Editor 

Denied. That's probably how 
every UCSD women's soccer 
opponent so far this season has felt 
after playing the second-ranked 
Tritons. 

The team is picking up nghi-
where it left off after last year's 20-
1-2 season that brought them all 
the way to the NCAA Division ill 
National Championship game 
against William Smith College in 
NewYorL 

TIle Tritons' stingy defense, 
which specialized in shutouts last 
year, is continuing that trend this 
season with four shutouts and a 4-
o record after yesterday's 9-0 
blanking of Whittier. 

UCSD goalie Brian Siljander, 
returning from last year's season-
ending shoulder injury and a player 
whom assistant coach Rolando 
Moreno touts as one of many Tri-
tons who may attain All-American 
status, backs up the new line. 

Back to School- Teresa Schwaar (4) and UCSD taught a 9-0 workshop to the Whittier Poets. 

"Our motto the last two years 
has been: 'If we have a clean sheet, 
we're not going to get beat, '" Head 
Coach Brian McManus said. 
"That's been the best part, that 
we're closing them down and not 
allowing anybody anything. It's 
what we keep working on ... 

S iJjander. who broke the school 
record for career shutouts last week 
against Cal Lutheran, failed to tally 
his 18th against Davis, however. 
The Aggies scored their only goal 
midway through the second half 
on a midfield indirect kick. 

Triton seniors Scott Goodman 
and Carrick Brewster hooked up 
for the game's first goalj ust before 
the half. but Goodman subse-
quently injured his knee. 

Senior Mike Kappes, acting as 
captain in Bradley 's absence, 
sealed the Triton victory in the 
second half when he fed Chris 
Hanssen on a perfectly executed 
indirect lcick with a lob to center 

over a waH of Aggie defenders. 
This type of performance from 

the veterans is one of the necessary 
ingredients for the Tritons to suc-
ceed. 

"We need all the seniors to play 
above themselves to pull us 
through," Armstrong emphasized. 

On the other hand, however, 
Armstrong has several first year 
players vying for regu lar time. De-
fensive rookies Chris Carli and 
Brian Bradbury have started all 
three games, and forward Chris 
Romey, whom Armstrong called a 
" rough diamond", tallied a goal in 
the first of his two starts. 

Armstrong pointed out that a 
key to the Tritons' 1989 success 
may lie with the first year players. 

"We need the freshmen to 
sprout," he said. "We've had some 
surprises. and today three or four 
(of five lotal) lost some of their in-
hibitions. We need a few more 
games to make some judgments."

Sushi Gallery Hosts 
Traumatic Art 

By Marie Pasternak 
Hiatus Intern 

From September 8 through 
October 14, the Sushi Perfonn-
ance Gallery in downtown San 
Diego is presenting the exhibition 
"Trauma," a political commentary 
on the tragedy in China by Chi-
nese artist Hung Liu. 

This exhibition is not a typical 
collection of wall hangings. but 
rather a dramatic use of wall space 
portraying images from Chinese 
medical texts and the martial art 
ofT ai Chi. The colors, which seem 
to dominate ·the room. are re-
stricted to black. white and a bold 
use of red. 

Murals such as that of a dying 
man and a woman mutilated 
through the practice of foot bind-
ing, as well as the striking depic-
tions of acupuncture charts, eerily 
reflect the sense of illness which 
Liu wishes to convey in her politi-
cal message. 

These figures are said by the artist 
to be representative of "the spirit 
of China." Liu uses these images of 
spirit in contrast with the medical 
images to create an imbalance that 
suggests "the psychic illness of her 
homeland." 

The artist in this unique ex-
hibit is not bound to pictorial 
images. Passages painted alongside 
many of the murals blatantly sug-
gest a meaning which the abstract 
pictures cannot easily convey to 
the Western viewer. Her worl: 
speaks of Taoism. the negative and 
positive energies of Yin and Yang. 
and the balance which exists be-
tween them. This balance embod-
ies Chinese philosophy. culture 
and political life. Balance becomes 
the central theme of the exhibi-
tion. illustrating the lack of bal-
ance as the cause of political srrife 
in China. 

Surrounding these morbid 
murals are the contrasting small 
wooden reliefs of rotund. almost 
jolly figures practicing Tai Chi. 

Liu has spent five years in the 
United States. first earning her 
Masters in Fine Art from UCSD. 
then moving on to her current 
position as an associate professor 
of art at the University of North-
em Texas. Added to her list of

achievements is the award of a

Prior to coming to the United 
States. Liu taught at the Central 
Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. 
Many of her peers and students 
were at the heart of the protests in 
Tiananmen Square. Students from 
the academy where she taught were 
responsible for erecting the sym-
bolic Statue of Liberty in the

return to China where her mother 
and many friends have remained. 
She realizes. however. that as an 
artist speaking out against the 
Chinese government. her chances 
of returning soon are very slim. 

There is no overwhelming sense 
of trauma in viewing "Trauma." 
The messages are understated and 
perhaps not entirely within a super-
fidal reach. 

The exhibit. however. does 
have a great deal to offer. particu-
larly for the artistically inspired 
and the politically motivated. 

For the aesthetic viewer. Liu 
has creatively manipulated wall 
space to make the room a part of 
the exhibit. As one wall adjoins 

the next. the theme is continued 
and expanded to create a unity 
which cannot occur within the 
individual boundaries of a canvas. 
liu's style has a distinct Chinese 
influence. 

Her unique juxtaposition of 
imagery and words worl:s to fur-
ther expand the limitless arena of 
artistic expression. 

From a political aspect. 
"Trauma" makes an important 
statement. It is a first-hand ac-
count of a troubled China which 
the media does not have the ca-
pacity to capture. It is an attempt 
to explain the political and cul-
tural obstacles which stand be· 
tween China and democracy . .

"The Package," a new suspense-

calls to mind another Hacl:man 
film of the same genre. "No Way 
Out." "No Way Out" was a flashy 
story containing little plot and a 
big twist at the end. "The Pack-
age." while a little stronger in the 
plot department. is also a lot weaker 
in terms of surprises; the film is 
tediously predictable. Unfortu-

Sergeant Johnny Gallagher. a 
typical tough-yet -soft character. 
While he is a jovial man for the 
most part, he can become hard-
ened when necessary. using every 
imaginable profanity and uttering 
such bold statements as, "I get this 
real bad feeling in my gut." 

When Gallagher. stationed in 
East Germany. challenges the 
judgement of the wrong people. he 
is given the lowly assignment of 
delivering a "pacl:age" to the 
United States. The "package" is 
Walter Henke. being taken back 
to serve time. Henke. however. 
escapes from Gallagher. (By the 
way. Henh is pronounced 
"Hankie"; it becomes somewhat 
humorous to hear everyone worry-

happen. Every character you an-
ticipate will be killed is l:iUed. 
Actually. if you have ever seen a 
police show on television where 
the good cop tries to stop the bad 
assassin before it's too late. then 
you have seen a less glossy version 
of "The Package." 

The predictability of the movie 
allows you to pay less attention to 
the story and notice holes in the 
plot line. Thereareminordiscrep-
ancies, such as the fact that Gal-
lagher has his loaded gun while 
confined under house arrest for 

Gene Hackman and Joanna Cassidy star in "The Package .• 

allegedly murdering a woman. 
Then there are the major flaws. 
such as the bad guys' intricate plan 
to frame Gallagher for the murder, 
rather than j ust quickly killing him 
as they did everyone else who knew 
too much. The gaps in plot are not 
especially noticeable, but they 
make the story seem sloppy. 

Hackman does well enough 
with the role of Gallagher. Since 
the character, however, is under-
developed. Hackman doesn't have 
a chance to display his range. 

The same holds true for Cassidy 
in the role of Gallagher's ex-wife. 
She does a good job. but the char-
acterization is very thin. 

Tommy Lee Jones. as "the 
package," is sufficiently bitter and 
frightening. However. as the title 
role he has a minor part. 

None of the ~tors, however. 
are given much to do by way of 
building relationships and bacl:-
grounds for their characters. The 
fault lies both in the script by John 
Bishop and in the direction by 
Andrew Davis. 

All in all. "The Pacbge" is a 
disappointment, Though the ac-
tion holds your attention. you have 
seen it all before. And though the 
actors are good. the characters have 
no depth. This film is an unfortu-
nate waste of talent.

James Cameron, the man who 
brought us such sci-fi thrillers as 
'The Terminator" and "Aliens," 
gave us another more terrestrial, 
or should I say aquatic, sinking 
adventure in 'The Abyss." 

Cameron, the writer and direc-
tor of the movie, said that "It has 
hardware, but it's not about hard-
ware. It has action, but it's not 
about action." What he really 
should have said was, "It has enter-
tainment, but it's not about enter-
tainment." The fact is, I'm not 
really sure what it was about. 

It seemed as if Cameron, who 
originally conceived the plot back 
in his high school days, simply 
tried to combine his two previous 
mega-hits. "The Abyss" has the 
hardware and techno-gadgets of 
both 'The Terminator" and "Ali-

ens," the love story of "The Termi-
nator," and, of course, the aliens. 
Unfortunately, these repeats are 
less convincing in his recent re-
lease than in his past works. 

The movie was such a hodge-
podge of earlier adventures, I was 
surprised Arnold Schwartzenneger 
didn't play Papa Alien, and I kept 
expectingJaws to pop in fora cameo 
appearance. 

The plot, which is so covered 
up by the fancy hardware that you 
hardly notice it, is better suited for 
two entirely separate movies. 

The story centers around an 
underwater oil drilling crew which 
is reluctantly pushed into helping 
a team of Navy SEAls rescue the 
remains of a nuclear submarine 
which mysteriously sank while on 
patrol. 

So far so good, right? That's 
what I thought. 

What gives the plot a sense of 
urgency is that the submarine has 
come to rest precariously on the 
brim of the Cayman Trough, an 
underwater chasm which drops four 
miles straight down. The search 
and rescue operation must be 
completed before the sub slips off 
into the so-called "bottomless pit." 

OK. Cut right there. 
Now, to me, that would have 

made for an interesting movie. But 
Cameron didn't let the plot de-
velop there. He never let the rela-
tionship between the platform's 
crew of near misfits and the hard-
headed Navy SEALs fully expand. 
Nor did he go in depth about the 
relationship between the soon-to-
be-divorced platform chief and the 
platform's designer. Instead, he 
threw in underwater aliens which 
nobody in the movie nor the audi-
ence can completely understand. 

Lt. Coffey, the stubborn leader 
of the SEAls, played by Michael 
Biehn (who, not so surprisingly, 
also starred in "The Terminator"), 
thinks the aliens are really Russian 
surveillance ships sent to gather 
secrets about the disabled sub. 

Over the course of the movie, 
he succumbs to pressure-induced 

psy~hosis, an illness caused by the 
great water pressure. A typical 
macho-type character, he becomes 
hell-bent on destroying the aliens. 

Lindsey Brigman, the platform'S 
designer, played by Mary Elizabeth 
Mastrantonio ("Scarface"), thinks 
the aliens are the most beautiful, 
friendly things she's ever seen. 
• Thus, the conflict. 

Interesting enough. But it could 
have, and should have been a sepa-
rate movie. That would have al-
lowed the audience to better under-
stand the aliens and why they came 
to inhabit the abyss. Instead, I 
walked out confused and under-
standing only one thing; I was out 
six bucks. 

Make no mistake; I won't see 
this movie again, and if you're 
looking for a straightforward ac-
tion adventure, I don't recommend 
this one. But, nevertheless, I must 
admit there are some memorable 
scenes, and at least one memo-
rable performance.

No Passion in Sea of Love 
By Catherine Dille 

Contributing Hiatus Writer 

Billed as an "erotic thriller," 
"Sea of Love." starring Al Pacino, 
Ellen Barkin and John Goodman 
of "Roseanne" fame was, more 
thriller than erotic. 

Pacino plays plays Frank Keller, 
aNew York City cop investigating 
a string of shootings when he falls 
in love with the prime suspect, 
played by Barkin. Goodman adds 
some much needed levity to the 
first half of the film as Keller's cop 
buddy Sherman Touhey, who helps 
him investigate the killings. 

Since all the murdered men 
were found lying face down naked 
in their beds, and all victims had 
recently placed rhymed personals 
in a singles magazine, Keller makes 
the brilliant assumption that this 
is the work of a disgruntled woman 

with a vendetta against men and 
bad poetry. Considering that 
Keller's wife left him for one of his 
fellow cops and he has sort of bad 
luck with women anyway, this is a 
natural assumption for him. Keller 
and Touhey decide to nab the killer 
by placing their own personal and 
asking the responding ladies to 
dinner where Keller will slyly get 
their fingerprints on a wine glass. 
Sounds foolproof. It's not. The one 
lady who escapes from the dinner 
table without touching her wine 
glass is the one Keller falls in love 
with. 

Helen (Barkin), whose last 
name we never learn, is not ex-
actly my prime pick for suspect 
one. She works in a shoe store, 
carries a starter pistol around in 
her purse and is single-handedly 
raising a daughter from a previous 
marriage. But Keller, even though 
he is in love with her, is paranoid 

RUNNING 

about her being the murderess, and 
eventually so are we. Two-thirds 
of the way into the movie I was se-
cretly begging her to kill him so 
the movie could be over. 

The sex scenesdon'tquite have 
the sizzle of "The Big Easy." but 
Keller obviously holds enough 
appeal for Helen that she doesn't 
leave him when, in a paranoid 
moment, he makes wild accusa-
tions and shoves her into a coat 
closet without explanation. But 
then what could he say? Honey, I 
suspect you're the killer I've been 
tracking down. 

When the climax does arrive, 
it's a startler in true "Jagged Edge" 
form. In the midst of flying fists, 
guns and blood, I found myself on 
the edge of my seat rooting for 
Keller. 

The succeeding scenes are 
somewhat anticlimatic, but it was 
clear sailing from there on in for

Artists Unite FOT Gre~npeace 
By Walter R. Bitts 

Hiatus Intern 

Greenpeace and Geffen Rec-
ords have teamed up and released 
an album to raise awareness of the 
consequences of environmental 
dangers. The album, entitled Rain-
bow Waniors, features a compila-

tionof31 previously released works 
by such musical artists as U2, Bryan 
Ferry, Sade, Sting, R.E.M., and 
the Grateful Dead. 

All music on the album has 
been donated by the artists, with 
the proceeds going to Greenpeace. 

Greenpeace hopes to raise sev-
eral million dollars from the al-

bum, and use the money for its 
campaigns on global environ-
mental issues such as ozone de-
struction, global warming, alter-
native energy research and the 
opening of Greenpeace offices in 
developing nations. 

Since 1972,Greenpeaceactions 
and lobbying have helped to 
change behaviors which they 
consider detrimental to the envi-
ronment. Endingatmospheric test-

Rockets 
Couotinued from page 1 

"I really like that song 'So 
Alive,''' cooed a neon-garbed 
blonde to her no-necked jock 
boyfriend. "This is their first al-
bum, right?" Looks of disdain and 
snorts of disbelief followed this 
comment from a group of girls 
decked out in death shrouds. 

Such a diversified crowd could 
hardly be imagined. The influx of 
neon into the traditionally ac-
cepted deathrock black has many 
longstanding Love and Rockets 
fans accusing the band of selling 
out. 

companied self-entitled album, 
Ash, along with bassist/lyricist 
David J and drummer Kevin 
Haskins, is beginning to enjoy some 
well-earned success. "We were 
pleased with 'So Alive.''' Ash said. 
"It was one of the last things we 
recorded for the album. It was like 
a magical moment in the studio 
when it came together .. .I felt re-
ally speedy that day, but I was 
totally straight. But I felt speedy, 
full of adrenalin, but I couldn't 
explain why. I just thought, 'we 
gotta record this today, it's gotta 
happen now!' That was one of 
those moments." 

and Haskins to form Love and 
Rockets, taking the name from the 
adult comic strip. 

Seventh Dream of a Teenage 
Heaven, the band's 1985 British 
debut album, was reminiscent of 
Ash and Haskins' work with Tones 
on Tail. Yet Love and Rockets 
failed to release the album in 
America until Express . Spotlight-
ing such dance hits as "Yin Yang 
and the Flowerpot Man" and 
"Kundalini Express," the U.S. 
version included a remake of the 
Temptations' "Ball of Confusion." 

"We're not adverse to [com-
mercialism) if that's what [the 
public) wants to do," Daniel Ash, 
guitarist/vocalist/lyricist, claimed. 
''There's that cynicism that if it is 
commercial, it cannot be any good. 
But the best gig I've seen lately was 
MichaelJackson in London. It was 
bloody marvelous! But people 
couldn'tand wouldn't admit that." 

Yet it isn't as if the members of 
Love and Rockets haven't experi-
enced similar creative pulls some-
time throughout their extensive 
musical careers. Originally from 
Nonhampton, England, the trio, 
along with singer Peter Murphy, 
began the Gothic-rock movement 
with the band Bauhaus. When 
Murphy left the band in 1983, Ash 
and Haskins joined with Glenn 
Camplingin the short-lived Tones 
on Tail, while David J joined the 
folk-punk group Jazz Butcher. 
Eventually, David rejoined Ash 

After the release of the 
psychedelic Earth Sun Moon, the 
band began to work on a series of 
big-band music with a odd twist. 
Originally designed for the cur-
rent album, the band decided that 
the songs did not fit within the 
overall musical theme. "It's very 
strange, eccentric and wacky 
sounding stuff," Ash explained. "[It 
has) a bit of Glenn Miller and the 
Andrew Sisters in there, mixed 
with '50s rock and roll." After 
finishing four other jazz-alterna-
tive pieces, the group plans to re-
lease the work, on an album 
entitled Swing, later this year. 

....., JettlelGlIardImI 
David J of Love and Rockets 

With the recent rise of both 
the single "So Alive" and the ac-

The willingness to experiment 
is parallel with Love and Rockets 
traditionally bizarre sense of hu-
mor. The band introduced a mythi-
cal group of aliens named the 
Bubblemen, claiming that the 
three aliens came to Earth to spread 
a message of world peace and love.

Usually described as creatures 
from the planet Girl. the band 
went as far as to record a twelve-
inch single under this alter-ego's 
name. In reality, the characters 
originated in doodles Ash drew 
during the latter portion of 
Bauhaus. 

The Bubblemen appeared 
alongside Love and Rockets dur-
ing an encore, appearing to be 
nothing more than stage hands 
garbed in bulky bumblebee outfits. 
Yet the ridiculous figures some-
how seemed natural against the 
complex light show and simplistic 
stage layout. The concert, even 
with its faults. illustrated that Love 
and Rockets is a strong live band. 
A few of the show's highlights 
were Ash dropping to his knees 
and dry-humping the air and, dur-
ing the final encore, David)'5 
monologue about transform ing the 
Open Air Theater into a risque 
nightclub. 

Yet such technical difficulties 
as dead microphones and unex-
pected feedback prevented the 
show from maintaining a consis-
tent flow of energy between the 
performers and the audience. It 
was obvious that with a little more 
preparation, the show could have 
been a display of the obvious tal-
ent that the trio have exhibited 
over the past decade. 

Abyss 
Continued from page .. 

Veteran actor Ed Harris (of 
"The Right Stuff" fame) played 
the oil rig's chief, Qr "toolpusher" 
as he called himself. His perform-
ance as a quick-witted, 5~rcastic, 
blue-collar hero was quite possibly 
the only bright spot in the murky 
waters of "The Abyss." 

However. the self-generated 
hoopla over "The Abyss" was not 
focused on his acting. Instead, the 
attention centered around the 
admittedly impressive break-
through technology used for film-
ing over forty percent of the live-
action footage underwater. 

This technology did allow for 
some very impressive cinematog-
raphy. for which the crew should 
be congratulated. Instead of ad-
dressing the problems with the plot, 
the filmmakers merely ran forcover 
behind all their technology when-
ever the script started to falter .. 
All they have done with this tech-
nology is seal "The Abyss" in a 
watery grave.

ues, they do not have the experi-
ence to connect with a larger audi-
ence. In time, the Mob's live po-
tential will overcome the intimi-
dation of bigger theaters. 

The following are excerpts from 
Ellison concerning the history of 
the Royal Crescent Mob. In 
Ellison's own words, "spread the 
gospel." 

How the bawl formed: 

Getting Wild With The 
Royal Crescent Mob 

ance, you would not expect him to 
be the lead vocalist of a fairly 
successful alternative band. In his 
lime pants, magenta and white 
striped shirt, and disarrayed mop 
of blond hair, Ellison's music is as 
unique as his appearance. Claim-
ing influences from the Kinks, the 
Bearles, and Chuck Berry, the 
band's blend of rock fundamen-
tals and hip-hop initially caused a 
stir with their 1986 debut album, 
Land of Sugar. Named after Ohio 
Player guitarist Leroy uSugarfoot" 
Bonner (whose lawn Ellison used 
ro mow for spending money), the 
piece won EP of the Year in the 
Village Voice. 

Although the recent Sire 
release Spin the World is a note-
worthy album, the band, which 
includes guitarist "B," bassist 
Harold Chichester, and drummer 
Carlton Smith, has always relied 
on roadwork to attract its audi-
ence. They have had openingspots 
with both the Replacements and 
Living Color and are currently on 
tour with the 8-52s. Used to per-

So we were just upstairs thinle-

Reclining backstage at the Los 
Angeles Greek Theater, I cannot 
help but be impressed by the plush-
ness of the dressing room. "I still 
keep thinking that we're in the 

wrong room," David Ellison, vo-
calist for the Ohio-based Royal 
Crescent Mob, sighed. "Someone's 
gonnasay, [in a whiny rone] 'Hey,

"fantastic" with a "ph." 
So 1 go, "well, we gotta get 

paid." So I started singing. the 
house lightman came down anJ 
played bass and "B" went to play 
guitar. W e did "Louie, Louie," and 
I made up the words being about 
King Louis and Louisville. So after 
that, we had a band name without 
Ray. He apologized and I thought, 
"forget it, let's give it up." But we 
had to play another month longer 
without letting Ray know that we 
were going to quit because we owed 
debts, and we had to get the money 
in and paying it off. When every-
thing was paid, we went into the 
gig and said "that's it." 

About IOIlftrlrins: 
It's done in different ways. It 

could be done by the entire band 
in practice when we're just jam-
ming. Someone could come in with 
something done. Two people may 
get together and collaborate, get 
the basic idea down and work out 
the rest with the rest of the band. 
It could be a number of ways. 

Someone could write the lyr-
ics, someone could write the mu-
sic. There's not one person; it's 
real cooperative. It's just day-to-
day. We get in there and some days 
you just jam and it might be great 
and the other days it might be a 
complete waste. [When it is a 
waste] we usually get a six-pack 
and call it off. 

About recording; 
[With Spin the World] we defi-

nitely approached the recording 
process differently. The "gee, I 
fucleed up my drum part, I missed 
the roll" or "man, I went flat there" 
or "I didn't play it like I wanted 
to." Well, too bad. We've got 15 
more minutes and we've got to get 
out of here. That is the attitude 
you have to take at that level. 

It's good to do it that way be-
cause you could linger forever. If 
the money were there you could 
labor for the rest of your life on one 
project. "Naw, that's nOt just the 
way I want it. I've listened to it and 
two weeks later it's not as good." 

If there were no pressures for 
getting a record out, it would talee 
a lifetime and you probably still 
wouldn't finish it. So you just do it. 

With Spin The World, we had a 
bigger budget and producers and 
people who knew how ~o run the 
equipment and could give us ad-
vice as how to play the songs as far 
as "you're play it too fast, you're 
playing it too slow, let's try this 
arrangement." People who knew 
how to flush out different sounds 
by use of the equipment in the 
studio as well as just other things. 

About the production crew: 
I wanted my Uncle Bernie to 

do it. But Sire had never heard of 
him and he had never worked in 
the business before, but he was 
sure he could do it. So they said 
"no" to Uncle Bernie. 

We've worked with Richard 
Gottehrer [who worked with BI-
ondie and the Ramones] and Eric 
Calvi [who mixed for Cameo and 
Duran Duran] on a record we did 
called S.N .O.B., which was basi-

Warring Factions in the 
Music Business 

By Patty J etde 
Hiatus Editor 

Musicians and critics don't 
quite Ienow whether to love or 
hate one another. Artists in the 
rock field tend to have this mis-
conception that because they play 
instruments, they are elevated to 
the level of genius. They utilize 
their talent, which is highly ques-
tionable in some cases, as an ex-
cuse for outlandish behavior, ex-
treme judgements, and holier-
than-thou attitudes pertaining 
towards the presa.1 do not mean to 
categorize all musicians with such 
a blanket statement, but how many 
times have you read an interview 
with an artist who labels critics as 
"nothing more than failed musi-
cians"? 

Admittedly, artists often have 
a valid argument against the press. 
To be asked the same questions, 
over and over, would try even the 
most patient. Yet the major con-
flict arises in the dispute between 
the role of the critic and the role of 
the musician. A journalist is only 
someone who second guesses what 
would interest the public; the suc-

cessful critic merely correctly 
guesses more often than his or her 
competition. 

In a serious music publication 
such as Rolling Stone, the people 
who write tend to be specifically 
interested in the field of entertain-
mentjoumalism. These people are 
familiar with rock music by being 
musicians themselves or through 
years of admiration. Regardless of 
one's connections or bedfellows, 
these individuals have a certain 
talent for writing, an eye for new 
talent and an ear for interviewing. 

The job of a critic is to give an 
opinion of some product, such as a 
record or a concert, so the general 
public will have some scale with 
which to judge it. The only differ-
ence between Robert Hilburn, 
senior music critic for the L.A. 
Times, and you is that Hilburn has 
more experience predicting public 
appeal and gets paid for his opin-
ions. 

Musicians put a lot of worle and 
effort into these creative products 
called albums. For some, the prod-

uct is nurtured and pampered like 
a child; for others, it is hastily 
thrown together, the most diffi-
cult step in the process being the 
discovery of the Fairlight's on-
switch. Due to budget limitations, 
impending deadlines and other 
corporation harassments, the art-
ists must often release a record 
without physically separating 
themselves from it for a period of 
time. It's like writing a term paper 
for a high school English class and 
feeling that your argument is flaw-
less. To read that same paper after 
a few years of college not only 
deflates the ego, but also illustrates 
what areas need additional work. 

As the album hits the market, 
the critics rub their collective 
palms in anticipation. Now you 
have to understand that to a rec-
ord company, this is a business 
dealing with multimillion dollar 
products. One of the most impor-
tant aspects of this business is 
publicity. Without exposure to the 
public, a revolutionary album by 
Band X mayse1l1,OOOcopies. That 
may seem a lot to the average 
consumer since vinyl sells for $8.99 
and the price of compact discs is 
absolutely outrageous. Yet a band, 
if they're lucley, will make 10-15 
cents off of each sale. After de-
ducting the cost of recording the 
album, distribution costs and other 
various odds and ends, it is not 
surprising that many bands even-
tually owe large debts to the major 
labels. As multinational corpora-

tions withstocleholders to appease, 
these labels don't appreciate losses. 
Obviously, the bigger the promo-
tional hype, the more the public 
becomes aware and interested in 
the product, and the greater the 
predicted profit. Warner Bros. 
summer block buster Batman is a 
perfect example of such tactics. 

Hence, the companies send out 
copies of albums to the various 
radio stations, newspapers and 
other forms of media throughout 
the world. {You can always tell 
when a company is really pushing 
a specific act: they send the album 
out on compact disc.} After re-
viewing the material, the critic 
must give his or her opinion. It's 
just that, merely personal specula-
tion. Who is to say whose view is 
correct? 

Yet musicians will either love 
or despise their critics, rarely as-
suming a stance in middle gray. If 
I listen to the latest Depeche Mode 
release. interpret complex sym-
bolic meaning within the lyrics 
and give a positive review, the 
band and its fans will love me for 
life. If, on the other hand, I feel 
that the album is nothing more 
than a mash of techno-pop trash 
that should have been burned in 
the studio, I am despised by the 
band and will receive death threats 
from irate teeny-boppers with a 
passion for black. The more well-
known critics tend to attract 
greater levels of emotional ex-
tremes. What most people forget is 

that people rarely listen to critics. 
How many times have you en-
joyed a movie that Siskel and Ebert 
proclaimed to be absolutely hide-
ous? 

In music, there are two catego-
ries of fans, the active and the 
passive listener. The active listener 
reads RoUing Stone, analyzes album 
lyrics and generally Ienows what 
bands are rising within the busi-
ness. This small percentage of the 
population include those who 
recognize bylines and associate 
specific tastes with each critic. It is 
these people who may follow a 
critic's advice, for they will recog-
nize which critics ha~e similar 
tastes to their own. 

The general populace falls into 
the passive listener category. These 
are the people who listen to 91 X or 
B100 because they are considered 
to be the "cool" stations. Usually, 
if they hear a song they like, they'll 
buy it, regardless of who sings it or 
what the song is saying. The people 
may skim an occasional Calendar 
section to see who is in town, but 
they don't care what Robert 
H ilbum may think of the new Band 
X album. They've heard the single 
on the radio, and they like it, so it's 
a quick trip to the Wherehouse to 
purchase the CD. 

What is the point of haVing 
critics if the majority of consumers 
don't listen? The answer is that 
they serve as an outlet of publicity, 
informing the public of what has

When you put on a Chris Isaak 
record, the same thing happens 
every time: the dark-hued, de-
pressed soul almost Jrips from the 
turntable to your floor. Although 
Isaak's two previous albums, Sil-
vercone and Chris Isaak, received 
showers of praise from the critics, 
they failed to put him in the fast 
lane of the pop world. So I pre-
pared myself not to be shocked 
when I put his recent release, Heart 
Shaped World, on my stereo. And 
from the first lick of the title track 
to the last drum beat of the final 
song, I was shocked. 

It wasn't that I found some-
thing like Run DMC. Far from it. 
What I discovered was 10 tracks of 
pure Chris Isaak. No changes, no 
tricks, no fakes, just totally un-
abridged soulful crooning set to 
beautifully melodic music that is 
second to none. Chris comes back 
on Heart Shaped World the same 
way he left off on his previous 
album. His voice still conjures up 
images of such great American bal-
ladeers as Elvis, Roy Orbison, and 
even Bing Crosby. The music, 
which is provided by James Wilsey 
on lead guitar, Kenny Dale Johnson 
on drums, Rowland Salley on bass, 
and Isaak on guitar, weaves a blan-

ket of somber, hypnotic melodies. 
Chris Isaak and his band, known 

as "Silvertone," have been work-
ing together since the mid-1980s. 
It is not that Isaak has failed to 
mature musically; rather he con-
tinues to produce music that comes 
naturally. And boy, is he good at 
it . l believe that he deserves a great 
deal of credit for not "selling out," 
like so many of today's artists are 
dOing. 

The album is fantastic from 
start to finish. Once you put this 
album on, it's hard to take it off. 
One reason is the album's musical 
consistency. Although not repeti-
tious, e.ach song seems to bleed the 
same soulful blood. This makes it 
difficult to pick one specific song 
to play over and over again, so you 
might as well play the whole thing. 

Isaak's lyrics give the image that 
he is either lying on a psychiatrist's 
couch looking for answers or crying 
on your shoulder. He nakedly dis-
plays his thoughts and emotions 
through his music. Most of his 
songs, such as "Kings of The High-
way" and "Wicked Game," speak 
of love found, then tragically lost. 
If I didn't know better, I'd think 
lsaalc was a bit of a manic depres-
sive. Most of what he says applies

Chris Isaak 
to all of us. Don't think this album 
is some black journey through the 
depthsofY04fmind, though. There 
are some very good upbeat songs to 
be found here, especially "Forever 
Young." But even this tune speaks 
of a lover leaVing. 

"If you hated my last two al-
bums, don't buy this one," Isaak 
jests, but he couldn't be any closer 
to the truth. This new one fits 
neatly in line behind the other 

two, but each time they seem to 
get just slightly better. 

If you adore Chris Isaak, this 
album is the same old (or should I 
say great) thing that Chris has 
always done. 

Let's hope the mainstream pop 
world wakes up to Chris Isaak 
before he wakes up to them. It 
would be a true shame to lose a 
musical vein as original and bril-
liant as this.

The Whos L·ast Tour. .. ? 
By David Burkhart 

Contributing Hiatus Writer 

Somehow, inexplicably, a half 
hour into the Who concert, my 
right foot fe 1I asleep. 

It wasn't as if) weresittingonit. 
I was standing on a chair, dancing. 
I was in the 19th row for one of the 
most important concert events of 
the summer of '89 - the latest 
Who farewell tour. The Who's last 
lOur. This was an event which only 
happens two or three times in a 
lifetime. 

Excited people surrounded me. 
It was a special kind of excitement, 
present to some degree at every 
concert, but particularly acute 
here: I'm in the presence of the 
band. This was THE WHO. They 
could have dec ided to confine their 
set to Willie Nelson covers and 
the crowd still would have called 

Green."

whaling are merely two examples 
of the organization'S accomplish-
ments. 

The name of the record was 
inspired by a native American 
prophecy that tells about a sick 
and dying planet being rescued by 
people of the world who, as warri-
ors, rise up to save it. 

The record provides Green-
peace with the opportunity to share 
its ideas and issues with nations 
not accustomed to environmental 
activism. The album will be re-
leased throughout Europe, the 
United States, India, and Latin 
America. Each album, cassette, and 
compact disc will have a form 
inviting people to join Greenpeace 
and become active in saving the 
planet. 

Greenpeace Chair David 
McTaggart, speaking of the album, 
says, "Music transcends every cul-
tural and ideological boundary and 
therefore is the best possible me-
dium we could have chosen to 
reach the maximum number of 
people." 

Geffen Records got involved 
with the project, according to 
President Ed Rosenblat, because 
" .... the cause was important, and 
beyond politics. It touches every-
one, just like music does." 

Consistent with the Green-
peace ethic, BMG/RCA is print-
ing the album sleeve on specially 
milled non-chlorine bleached 
paper. Also, most territories will 
not use environmentally destruc-
tive plastic shrink wrapping on 
the album. 

The Rainbow Warriors album 
seeks to transcend barriers by 
adopting a common language-
music - that the world commu-
nity can understand, and iIi doing 
so raises the levelofenvironmental 
awareness. 

Perhaps there has never been a 
more critical time as now, given 
the current situation of our planet,

tude. 

them back for an encore. 
But, of course, they d idn 't play 

"On The Road Again.· Playing 
old standards, they starting with a 
set of songs from Tommy, then 
moved on to some older songs, and 
others from Pete T ownshend'ssolo 
albums. 

They were playing a tight set. It 
was heavily rehearsed, and - at 
least in the first half of the show-
lacked emotion. It was hard to 
forget that this band had played 
many of these songs sihce before I 
could speak and weren't exactly 
feeling the same emotions they 
felt the first time they performed 
them. But they were having a good 
time, and the backup musicians-
especially those in the hom sec-
tion - were having a great time. 
A musician's joy is infectious. The 
crowd was haVing a genuinely good 
time, more than just the "pres-

1 

ence" syndrome. 
By this time my right foot was 

almost completely numb, my left 
foot hurt, and I suspected my chair 
was in imminent danger of col-
lapse. (I'm not a small person). I 
hopped down and tried to massage 
some life into my foot, almost 
certainly missing some of 
Townshend's stage antics -
mostly hopping around in his 
sneakers and doing jumps which 
would cripple most men his age. 

A guy behind me yelled" Any-
one got any Zig-Zags?" 

At every concert I've ever been 
to (with the exception of that 
Kenny Rogers show I don't like to 
talk about), I've been asked for 
rolling paper. Don't they think 
before they leave home, "Gee dude, 
I've got thirty pounds of pot hid-
den in my clothing. Maybe I should 
bring something to smoke it with ... 

The band was in its second set. 
The fifteen minute break ("for 

tea," Roger Daltrey said) seemed 
to have helped. The horns were 
hopping, the backup singers were 
dancing, Townshend was grinning, 
and the stadium ~ shaking with 
screams. 

13 HIATlJS SEPTEMBER 18 , 1989 

I'm swept up in it. It's THE 
WHO. I was in the presence of 
greatness. It didn't matter that my 
foot was asleep. It didn't matter 
that Daltrey was able tosing "hope 
I die before I get old" with a straight 
face. I was surrounded by my gen-
eration and, hey, we were alright.

recorded at a couple of county fairs 
in Ohio and two songs. One was 
new, called "Happy At Home," 
and the other was a song called 
"Two Sisters." 

But Eric's expertise was dance

put a bid in for that but they 
checked my credit sources and 
realized that I couldn't come

asked if they take credit cards: "00

About life on the road: 

We got our equipment ripped 
offin Washington, D.C. once. Not 
all of it, but some pieces of it. 

Harold and Carlton were at an 
all· night hamburger joint. While 
they were inside, someone went 
inside the van while they were 
eating. They came back and it was 
ripped off. They took what they 
could carry. 

So they went on a mad, frenzied 
search through the alleys ofW ash· 
ington and actually found it in a 
dumpster. That was pretty wild. 

Apparently, [the thieves) must 
have went into an alley to stash it 
and were going to go back to get 
some more or get some friends to 
help them carry it, or whatever.

recently been released into the 
market. The content of the cri· 
tique, either positive or negative, 
doesn't really alter the fact that 
people are now aware of the prod. 
uct because the article reached 
print. 

Yet it is never easy to have 
some stranger verbally rip apart 
one's work. If you have ever had to 
sitthrough a group evaluation. you 
know the feeling that John Doe 
may have a personal grudge against 
you as he exploits the technical 
points of your work. If that one· 
on·one conflict seems difficult, 
imagine the entire world criticiz· 
ingyou. 

Unfortunately, critics are only 
human and often succumb to jeal· 
ousy and pride. It's great to be on 
mailing lists, receive albums and 
attend concerts for free. Yet they 
often forget that underneath all 
the promotional glitz, they are 
journalists. 

Sometimes critics allow their 
egos to alter them from being music 
critics to omnipotent demigods. 
Rather than offer constructive 
criticism, they write merely to show 
how bitingly and cynically they 
can cut down a band. The attitude 
of "this band sucks because I say so 
and I'm always right" is something 
that is too often seen within the 
entertainment press. 

To be a successful critic one 
must love journalism, not use it as 
a way to break into the entertain· 
ment business. 

It's difficult to decide who is 
right, the critic or the artist. What 
most tend to forget is that both 
sides need one another. Without 
the press, musicians would have a 
very difficult time breaking into 
stardom. On the other hand. with· 
out musicians providing a prod· 
uct, critics would have nothiJlg to 
do except criticize themselves.
