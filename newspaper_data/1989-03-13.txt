ciali t Sanford Lakoff aid Friday 
that he feel the bombing marks 
the beginning of an increa e of 
terrorist attacks in America. 

Lakoff said that the time lap e 
si nce the Vincennes'downing of 
an Iranian airliner ha not been 
too great for this bombing be an 
act of retaliation, co nsidering the 
time needed to obtain explosives 
and organize the action. 

" It didn 't take long for the ter-
rori ts to strike because it t? ke 
time to get the people here and the 
e plo i es here. Besides. retalia-
tory action has been taken. The 
attack on the Pan Amjet in Lock-
erbie wa in retaliation for the 
Vincennes," he aid . 

UCSD profes. or of interna-
tional relations John Ruggie, 
however, doe not fore ee an 
e calation of terrorist activities in 
the United tates. He believe the 
bombing wa "probably a specific 
repri al for a pecific act" and 
suggested that the choice of e -
plosive u ed in Friday' incident 
might indicate that the bombing 
was not a profe sional terrori t 
attack . 

"[The perpetrator(s)] u ed a 
pipe bomb," he said, noting that. 
"Profes ional terrori t don't u e 
pipe bomb, they use [an e plo-
sive called] plastique; it' more 
effective. " 

Ruggie went on to ay that the

Rogers wa on her way to work 

when the incident occured . 
" Mr . Roger wa northbound 

on Gene ee, topped at a light just 
outh of La Jolla illage Drive 

right next to Ca rlos Murphy' 
[restaurant] at TC. She was 

about the third or fourth car from 
the inter ection, and there were 
some construction people right 
next to the Genesee lanes doing 
some work." David ohen, enior 
public information officer at the

Aftermath - The burned-out van which had been driven by Sharon 
Rogers sat at the locatiO of Its bombing, In the middle of Genesee 
Avenue. while Investlgalors from various government agenCies 
probed the wreckage. The site was guarded through Friday night, 
until a special FBI investigation team arrived from Wa shington on 
Saturday.

Gary Laturno. an FBI agent 
. involved in the investigation of 

the bom bing. recounted Roger' 
account of the incident. 

"Once he heard ... backfiring 
ounds. Mr . Roger topped the 

van and got out of it," he said . 
explaining that econd after he 
exited the van on the driver' ide. 
it bur t into flame. at appro i-
mately 7:40 a .m. 

Con!>truction ~orker Charle 
rcher. who wa building a mor-

tar wall appro imately 15 feet 
a~ay at the tIme of the explosion. 
described the cene. 

"I heard a couple of boom . a 
real loud boom. then black moke 
and flames came from the \an . I 
thought it was an M- 0 or 
a .. . bomb." 

Kurt Lent. another con truc-
tion worker etting up equipment 
nearb . added. "I thought it wa a 
car backfiring or the concrete 
pump that had ju 't been et up. 
but then I looked over and a w 
the van on fire ." 

Lent was routing traffic a ay 
from the burning an when he 
saw Roger ' come around to the 
pa enger . ide of the vehicle. 

" he came lround to the other 
' ide of the van which made me 
think that another pa!. enger 
might be till inside. so I looked 
in ide all the windows."through a 
thick creen of moke. he aid . 

Lent determined that there were 
no other pa!. enger in the van 
while John hri ty. hi construc-
tion upervi or. aided Roger. 

"John aw her staggering away 
from the van toward us. He took 
her to hi truck and they called 
her hu 'band from hi cellular 
phone." Lent aid. 

The R ogerse. according to 
ohen. "live very nearby. so I 

suppo e that. when [Captain 
Roger] wa called at home. he 
was there . at the cene of the 
bombing, in a couple of minute ." 

Upon arrival at the cene, Cap-
tain Billy Davi of the an L>iego

Student Protests at U CSB and 
Howard University Bring Results 

Representative of a student group at UCS B who 
engaged in a prote t fas t for almost two weeks met 
Friday afternoon with Chancellor Ba rbara Uehling 
and ot her influential members of the University 
community. 

The meetings were closed to the press. They 
occurred following prote ts by student and non-
student regarding alleged racism in the UC system. 

U SO's A.S . has also expressed support for this 
protest movement. During last Wednesday's A .. 
meeting R ueben Duran, E tee Holiday and John 
Ramirez introduced a measure expressing strong sup -
port for the prote~ting students at UCSB. 

Protesters had a lso been petitioning for a two-
cour e UC ethnic studies requirement. They had nine 
other co re d emand s, all of which were concerned with 

unive r~ ity racial equalit y at the student and fae ult 
levels. 

Incidents in other parts of the United States have 
indicated that administrators a nd officials are 
res ponding to student protests. At Howard nive rsity 
in the District of Columbia. more than 1,000 studenrs 
recently took ove r the school's administration build-
ing in an effort to fo rce the removal of Lec Atwater. 

c hai rper~on of the Re publican at ional Committee. 
from Howard 's boa rd of trustees. 

T he stude nts vowed tha t they would reta in co ntrol 
of the bu ilding until Atwa ter, who they condemned a 
"consistently oppo ed to the agenda of Afnca n-
American people," was removed from the board of 
trustees. 

Atwater re igned after watching televised reports of 
the incidents.

BOMB: Blast May Be

The UTC parking lot closest to 
the area of the street where the 
explosion occured was cordoned 
off and no one was allowed to 
enter, other tha n to move their 
ve hicles. 0 evacuation in the 
UTC area was ordered . 

"We are letting people filter

San Diego Police Department 
commented at the time of the 
inci de nt. "\t's an FBI order 
because they have to do a debris 
sea rch. " 

used to searc h the Rogers' U ni -
ver ity City home, but no ex plo-
sives were found . 

Naval I nves tigative Services 
said that no threats prior to the 
incident had bee n received by the 
Rogerses or any of the Vincennes ' 
crew. 

" We receive crank ca lls every 
day but. to my knowledge, there 
has never been a bona fide threat 
made to any member of the crew," 
Chief Craig Huebler, a spokes-
person for the Com mander aval 
Ba e said . 

Co hen said that no one has 
eIaimed res ponsi bilit y for the 
bombing, sayi ng, " I have no 
knowledge that a ny terror ist 
group is involved ." 

Special Agent in Charge of the 
San Diego FBI Tom Hughes told 
re porters that, at this point , offi-
cials have been unable to deter-
mine definite motives for the 
bombing and have found no sus-
pects. Despite this, Hughes said, 
the FBI "will not rule out the 
potential possibility of retribution 
to Captain Rogers for his past 
command in the Navy." 

Rogers was the ca ptain of the 
Vincennes when it shot down an 
Iranian airliner in the Persian 
GulfonJuly3, 1988. The airc raft , 
which was mistakenly ide ntified 
as an Iranian F-14 figh ter, had 
failed to respond to repeated 
warnings radioed by the U.S. 
cruiser. 

By 10 a.m. , MAST mem bers 
were down on t/leir knees raking 
the pavement with rubber-gloved 
hands, searching the one-half 
block area of the street cordoned 
off by police lines for bomb frag-
ment . Reporters swarmed around 
witnesses as the blackened shell of 
Rogers' white Toyota was exam-
ined by explosives experts. A 
handful of onlookers watched the 
explosive teams at work while 
police helicopters hovered over-
head . 

"1I:evertheless, until the fina l 
FBI report comes in, we have 
directed base to heighten secur-
ity awareness," he added. 

At approximately 1:30 p.m .. 
the Rogerses were escorted to a 
secure place, according to Dillon. 

FBI Agent Laturno later added 
that , "the Naval Investigati ve 
Services are providing protection 
for the Rogerses . They've been 
assigned special agents to ensure 
no harm is done to the family ." 

At the time of the incident , 
Rogers thought that the plane 
was descending on his ship. With 
the plane nine miles away, the 
Vincennes fired two surfaee-to-
air missiles which destroyed the 
plane. The aircraft was later dis-
covered to be an Iranian Airbus 
A300 carrying 290 civilian pas-
sengers, all of whom were kiIled . 

an indication that [terrorists] a re 
getting ready to step up attacks in 
the U.S . The likelihood ofa wave 
of terrorism is mall; the likeli-
hood of smaller terrorist incidents 
is realistic and very possible." 

UCS D profe so r of inter-
national relations John Ruggie 
holds a different view. 

" If [Friday' bombing] was a 
terrorist attack, and ifi t was byan 
Iranian group, it's probab ly a 
specific reprisal for a specific act," 
he aid . "I don't [foresee] random 
terrorist attacks in the fut ure . I'd 
be urprised if there wasn't an 
Iranian con nec tion , but we 
sho uldn 't j ump to conclusions." 

Prese nt at the scene of the 
explosion were the San Diego 
Fire Department, the FBI, the 
Metro Arson Strike Team, the 
Explosive Device Team, and the 
San Diego Police Department. 

According to Officer Cohen, at 
a pproximatel y 8 a .m ., the 
Rogerses were escorted to a local 
police sta tion . where Captain 
Rogers' car was -checked for 
bombs. 

Bomb-sniffing dogs were later 

The Rogerses have a son, Will, 
who attends college. He was out 
of town during the incident , and it 
is uncertain if he will also be 
placed under special protecton, 
Dillon said . 

When asked why the FBI took 
over the situation, Officer Cohen 
responded that "there is obvious 
possible, and I want to emphasize 
the word 'possible,' federal juris-
diction here. Rogers is a naval 
captain. He obviously was involv-
ed in an incident that drew signifi-
cant worldwide attention." 

Iran, condemning the atlack. 
vowed at the time to seek revenge 
for these deaths. 

In an interview with Guardian 
reporters several hours after the 
La Jolla explosion, Professor 
Lakoff, author of several papers 
on U.S. policy in the Middle East 
and U.S. military policy in the 
Persian Gulf, said that if the 
bombing was a terrorist act, "it 
will be the first known case of 
Middle-Eastern terrorism in the 
U.S." He conjectured that "This is

Terrorism Hits Home 
At 7:41 a .m . Friday morning, te rrorism came home. Certainly 

e eryone at UCSD has heard about it now; if not on the top of 
all the Friday new cast, at least on the front page of this paper. 

W e all knew, as Americans, that thi was going to happen 
someday. We didn't know, as San Diegan , that it would come 
so clo e to home; walking distance from the Central Library. It 
i n't at all clear who was responsible, though the evidence does 
point strongly to the Iranian government and its piritual leader, 
the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini . But we will probably never 
know; even if the per on who planted the crude pipe bomb under 

haron Rogers' van i arrested, it's extremely unlikely that it will 
be po ible to trace the path through the intricate web which , 
possibly, leads back to Khomeini. 

I n a co er tory in the March 6 U.s. ews and World Report, 
a counter-terrorism expert wa quoted a aying "The Iranian 
network in the U.S. is the most dangerous and troubleso me of all 
the terror group in the . ." The same story discu sed the near 
impo sibility of understanding the connections in the compli-
cated chain of command in the network, much les being able to 
act on that information and stop the terror. The terrorist net-
work may be so exten ive a to allow action anywhere on the 
globe. 

And now the U.S. has been directly touched by international 
terrorism. On our soil. At an intersection mo t UCSD tudent 
drive through frequently . It was an amateurish effort; one or two 
si mple pipe bomb, a far cry from the sophi ticated device which 
brought down Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. It 
might not have been omeone directly linked to the Iranian 
terrorist network. but that's almost irrelevant. Rand Corpora-
tion terrori T'" expert Bruce Hoffman said in the Los Angeles 
Times that "Terrorists tend to be imitative rather than innova-
tive." 0 if there i a terrori t network in the U. ., and the FBI i 
sure there is, then future attacks can be expected regardless of 
who wa respon lble for thi one. 

Statistically, there are more people killed each year from 
swallowing toothpicks than from terrorist attacks . Nevertheless, 
terrorism, by its randomnes and utter barbarity. force peo ple 
and governments to change their a~tions . But a war on terrorism 
may be as ineffectual and potentially ridiculous as a war on 
toothpicks . Terrorists are becoming sophisticated in their savag-
ery, and their target are far too diverse to effectively guard 
against them. Apprehending them is difficult, prosecuting them 
nearl y impossible. Getting to the leaders makes prosecuting 
organized crime leader look trivial; they are often protected by 
governments such as Syria and Iran , and they are hidden behind 
layers of "cells" which make proving their guilt difficult. 

But a clear anti-terrorism policy is necessary. In President 
Bush's inaugural addres~, he implied that there wa hope for new 
ties between Iran and the U.S. And hope there was, but Iran 's 
treatment of Salman Rushdi e, it clear complicity in interna-
tional terrorism, and the continued holding of hostages, have 
made this hope fade. The moderates in the Iranian government 
may exist , but recent eve nts demonstrate that their political 
power is limited and probably waning further. There can be no 
capitulation to terroris m , and even if the war i unwinnable, it 
must be fought. 

It must be fought by normal law enforcement means, such as 
attempting to find those who plant bombs and kidnap innocent 
people, but it must also be fought by peaceful attempts to isolate 
such countries economically, and stop the flow of weapons. The 
improving relationship between the U.S . and the Soviet Union 
will be helpful in this , si nce the Soviet Union supports Syria and 
has recently been attempting to establish a relationship with 
Iran. Their reasons for this are obvious; the Middle East is 
st rategically vital. But in a new atmosphere of greater trust and 
openness, much of the superpower connict which further fuels 
the flames of Middle East conflict can be removed . 

Terrorism makes the phrase "supcrpower"seem almost comi-
cal - Vietnam and Afghanistan demonstrate that military 
might i nearly useles against a motivated group of well-funded 
guerrillas , and that's precisely what terrorists are, with the whole 
world their battleground . But we must attempt to fight terrori m 
a effectively as pos ible, without las hing out in impotent rage 
against poorly selected targets , and also without indicating to 
the world that terrori m inside U.S. borders will be at all toler-
ated . Walking that fine line will be a formidable task for the 
Bu h administration, but if there's any time for bipartisan~hip , 
this is it, and the administration must work with Congress to 
create It clear policy to do what can be done to limit the ~avagery.

Iacocca Article 
One-Sided 
Editor: 

In her front-page report on the 
recent ational Education Asso-
ciation conference on "Education 
and the ew Economy," Catherine 
Dille presented a one-sided and 
incomplete account of the speech 
by Chrysler President Lee lacocca. 
Her article contained only quotes 
from lacocca's speech, with no 
reaction by any of the 600 teachers 
who were subjected to his hard-
line, pro-business diatribe. In fact, 
the reaction by experienced class-
room teachers was largely skepti-
cal arrd negative. 

lacocca. the slickest salesman 
for American capitalism, made 
two main points in hi peech . 
First , much like Joe "Lean On 
Me" Clark, the bat-wielding high 
chool principal , lacocca urged 

that only those tudents who toe 
the disciplinary line be allowed to 
attend school. The urban under-
class, largely black, that has little 
educa ti on and few skills, and that 
contributes disproportionately to 
the crime wave and the associated 
drug epidemic, can never become 
productive members of society if 
they are barred from schools.

discuss a re innovative programs

to get these kids excited about 
learning, instead of boring them 
and pu hing them out into the 
halls and streets. 

lacocca also pushed his favor-
ite panacea , the "business-
education partnership" that is a 
transparent cover for turning 
teachers into shill for brand-
name consumption. The March 7 
edition of the New York Times 
reported the spreading use in 
school of Channel One, a sup-
posed news video program broad-
cast into classrooms. These pro-
grams are laced with commercials 
for jeans. soft drinks and junk 
food. and contain an implicit pro-

business message. The videos are 
provided free , and schools that 
use them have become part of 
Madison Avenue. 

The Guardian reporter should 
have noticed. unless she took 
everything from a press release , 
that the teacher who listened to 
lacocca were generally appalled 
by his message and that he had 
implicitly threatened their class-
room autonomy and professional 
integrity. Selling cars and swing-
ing bats at students are not the 
jobs of classroom teachers.

This letter concerns an ex-

Without a doubt you will be 
able to recognize him. He dresses 
like this everyday. 

What mostdon't knowordon't

is human . He should not be pes-

laughed at or scorned. He is

thing people don't understand. 

He has a unique quality about

Memories of a Far 
Away Home 

By ANDREA ADLEMAN 
Contributing Features Edilor 

I used to say "I know I'll never .... .. a lot. I 
think I'm going to avoid doing so in the future, 
since I have proven myself wrong several times in 
t he recent past. 

The first incident happened at my high school 
graduation last June. I haled high school during 
my senior year, and counted the days (hours, 
minutes, seconds .... ) until graduation. I couldn't 
wail to get away from my classmates, and the 

Then graduation day arrived, and boy was I 
excited. As we were taking our seats, the girl next 
to me, Karin, said something to the effect of, "Oh, 
this is so sad. I know I'm going to cry." I, on the 
other hand, knew I was not going to cry. All I 
wanted to do was get my diploma , and kiss high 
school goodbye. 

Or, so I thought. 
After we, the graduates, had marched out to 

the fluffy graduation music of "Pomp and Cir-
cumstance," the profundity of what had just 
happened sort of sneaked up and grabbed me. I 
realized that I was about to leave behind my 
friends and the familiarity, however hated , of my 
high school. And I cried. And I hugged my 
friends. While they hugged each other, I cried to 
myself. I was just a wreck. 

My high school was in Reston, Virginia, which 
is a suburb of Washington D .C. (Yes, aliforni-
ans , Virginia borders Washington D .C., and 
Maryland borders it on the other side. I feel 
compelled to offer this mini-geography lesson, 
since many Californian don't seem to know the 
East Coa t very welL)

Home: D.C. Memories 
Continued from page 4 

This summer my family and I moved from Reston to 
the Los Angele area. This brings me to the second case 
in which I did what I never thought I would . 

My feelings about the move were positive; I was very 
anxious to move out to famous "sunny Southern Cali-
fornia." I had come out several times to visit my aunt in 
Santa Monica, so I was somew hat acquainted with the 
area . I liked what I saw, and was looking forward to 
seeing more. 

We had lived in Reston for 12 years, and so the 
prospect of a change was very appealing. Reston did not 
offer a lot to do for fun - the movies and shopping were 
the favorites . Washington D.C. offered more things to 
do, but my overprotective mother prevented me from 
doing what I most enjoyed there. going to hear the 
atypical bands at the little clubs that spotted the city. I 
was sick of the weekend routine of either going to the 
movies or fighting with my mother about going down-
town. So, as I've said, I was excited about moving out to 
California and starting anew. 

Moving day drew near, and my friends came to say 
goodbye. I was sad, but mostly okay. We rationalized 
that my moving was not a big deal since we were all going 
our separate ways for college anyway. I was just leaving a 
few months earlier, that's all. 

Moving day came and we headed off to the airport . I 
though I was going to be fine, but I was very wrong. The 
first of many sad moments came when I had to say 
goodbye to my father. My parents are divorced and we

He is also the king of heavy 
metal (or at least the recogni7.ed 
figure), and a true master at 
argumentation. 

And the reason this letter is 
provoked is because of the inci-
dent occurring in the Revelle 
Plaza March 8. If you were there, 
you saw it. If you weren't, it need 
not be repeated. 

He is "The Jolt Guy." But he is 
also human, and person neither 
bought or sold. We should admire 
him for his uniqueness, not con-
demn him.

Awareness 
Is Important 
Editor: 

I am bothered by Fred ric 
Hamber's recent commentary 
entitled "Disguised Racism." This 
is due to several points Mr. 
Hamber brings up in the course of 
his attack on ethnic awareness. 

As a senior at Third College, I 
have taken several courses and 
participated in a number of lead-
ership training seminars which 
focus on "ethnic awareness," and 
I find Hamber's ideas completely 
off-base. His criticism of such 
awarenes seems to center on the 
idea that it leads to racial violence

were leaving my father behind . I don't remember my 
exact feelings about leaving my father, except that I 
knew I'd miss him, of cour e. 

My memories of how I felt at take-off are. however, 
very clear. My 15-year-old sister and I sat in adjacent 
eats - she had the window seat, and I was on the aisle. 

The plane's engines started to roar, and somewhere 
along the line, my sister began to cry. As the plane sped 
down the runway, she mumbled "I don't want to leave" 
through her tears. I tried to comfort her, but instead 
found myself crying with her . 

At first , I was crying because it hurt me to see my sister 
so sad. But then I realized what a major part of my life I 
was leaving behind , and I cried because I was hurting. 
The flight allendant was coming by with the drink cart, 
and not wanting her to see me crying, I quickly dried my 
eyes. Although I tried to conceal it externally, I was still 
crying inside. 

During the summer, I had a really fun time being a 
beach bum. I had nothing to worry about - my greatest 
concern was getting an even tan and avoiding strap 
marks. My mother, sister and I had fun exploring our 
new environment and taking advantage of the great 
weather. I loved everything about Southern California 
that I had seen so far . Even getting a California driver's 
license and license plates was very exciting. 

Now, eight months later (almost to the day; we moved 
July 12), I miss Reston and Washington very, very much. 
I have not been back to visit, although my mother and 
sister both have. I miss myoid house, my street, the lillIe 
shopping center nearby, everything. Sometimes I wonder 
if I still know how to get around Reston, going over in 
my mind how to get to certain places, and at which

inter ections to turn. 
I even miss my high school. I would give anything to 

walk down those halls again. to visit myoId teachers, my 
old locker. For all four years, J had locker number four. 
First came Stephen at locker number one, then Robin , 
then Karin, then me. Pam was on my other side, and I 
think Danielle was next to her. 

J am constantly searching for things that remind me of 
Reston / Washington . A few weeks ago, J met someone 
here in San Diego who was from Reston , and I exuber-
antly began to reminisce with him. It turns out he lives a 
mile from my house - myoId house. 

Flipping through the Los Angeles Times the other 
day, I caught sight of an article about earthquakes. 
Scanning the lead, I aw that it mentioned the U.S. 
Geological Survey, which is headquartered in Reston. 
The beginning did not say anything about Reston, so I 
quickly turned to the continuation of the article, hoping 
to see a reference to the Re ton headquarters. I did not 
find one . 

Whenever J am doing research on the ground floor of 
Central Library, the floor on which newspapers are 
housed, I always flip through the current issue of The 
Washington Post . I look through the Metro section for 
news about Reston and I glance at the ads. J see the 
full-page ads for the department stores I once knew 
intimately, and I miss Washington. 

I miss my escapades into Washington D.C. at night. 
There is something about the monuments at night that 
can only be described as indescribable. The Washington 
Monument stands tall on a grassy hill, softly lit to di tin-
guish it from the darkness, flags circling its base. By

Hamber's attack on student 
regent finalist Alex Wong as a 
" la tter day Nati " was completely 
unjust and inaccurate as well . He 
ci te Wong's goal of "redefining 
racial categories" and says Wong 
is attempting to separa te and 
categori ze society. This is no t the 
case. If Hamber wou ld check Mr. 
Wong's statements with a bit more 
scrutiny, he would find that Wong 
was referring only to racial cate-
gories as a pplied by the UC sy -
tem's admi sion policy. 

Wong's argument was that the 
current policy arbitra rily classi-
fies different peoples into broad , 
ge neralized categorie such as 
"Asian"when such catch-all terms 
are not always applicable. This 
problem of categorization seem

In a perfect societ y, there might 
not be a need to catego rize ethnic

Six Panelists Discuss Status of Working Women 
By CATHERI NE DILLE 
Staff Writer 
In ce lebration of International 

Women's Day, the International 
Ho use on the Fifth College cam-
pus sponsored a panel discussion 
on March 8, bringing together six 
s pecialists to discuss the status of 
working women around the world . 

Each panel ist presented an 
overview of t he si tuation of 
women in the workfo rce in her 
area of ethnic specia lty and then 
answered que tions from the 
audience. 

The discussion was modera ted 
by Mary Dhooge, the dean of 
international educatio n at UCSD. 

Vasanthi Shenoy, an instructor 
of sociology of M iracosta Col-
lege, began by describing India as 
a land of contradiction s. "The 
paradox of the Ind ian people," 
she said, "lies in that it has intel -
lec tual , highly educated and 
broad-minded people side by side 
with the ma sses of illiterate 
people ." 

Shenoy said national ideals 
brought women out of the home 
and into the work-place in Ind ia. 

"[Leaders of the new gove rn-
ment] realized that the on ly way 
to arou e the women from their 
traditional domesticity wa to 
appea l to their se nse of patriot-
ism, national consciences and to 
their sense of socia l re ponsibil-
ity," she said. 

he also 'aid that many women 
worker are exploited by employ-
er and moneylenders , even 
though sex discrimination is 
illegal. . 

po ver ty," she said. Avery ex-
plained that such women have 
c hildren because they do not have 
well-paying jobs and lack the 
education to get those jobs. 

UCSB instructor Wendy g 
poke of the diversity of Asian 

wo rk ing women in the U.S . 
"Asia n-American women are a 

very diverse group . T heir diver-
sity is along the lines of et hnicity, 
as we ll as income, generation, age 
a nd occupation . Over 60 different 
Pacific Island ethnic groups are 
counted by the U.S . census," she 
said . 

Ng said that Asian-American 
women tend to tay in low visi bil-
ity occupations such as account-
ing and sc ience. She pointd out , 
though, that there is an unusually 
high number of Asian-American 
women in the field of broadcast 
journalism, "beca use of what I 
ca ll the 'Connie C hung image,' .. 
she said . • 

Anthropoligi t Martha Lamp-
land , s peaking on the situat ion of 
working women in Hungary, said 
that the Communist regime that 
took over Hungary yea rs ago 
" promised women a lot and gave 
them very little." 

She commented that very few 
women are found in the upper 
levels of Hungarian government, 
and pointed out tha t there is a 
very trong practice of gender-
typing in that country, where some 
occupation are con. ide red tradi-
tionally male and others tradi-
tionally female . 

I n the early years of socialism, 
Lampland said , there was en-
couragement for "women to 
engage in all kinds of activities 
that would not have been engaged 

children. 
She noted that amo ng the fac-

tors that led Sweden to it present 
treatment o f women was the long 
tay in power of the Social-

Democratic Party, which allowed 
the government to implement 
long-te rm changes. 

However, he also no ted that 
Swedi h women choose tradition-

ally female occupations. 
Clinical psyc hologist R ei na 

Jua rez, the final speaker of the 
afte rnoon, focused on the role of 
working women in Latin Amer-
ica . She pointed out that unlike 
Sweden, many Latin American 
countries are in a sta te of revo lu-
tion and the government do not 
have time to enact long-term pol-

icies regarding women. 
I n the cosmopolitan ci ti es of 

Latin America , it is accepta ble for 
a young woman to live on her 
own and ha ve a profession before 
marriage. 

However, " there a re many 
people who would prefer to go to 
male profe sionals becau e women 
are not taken seriously," she said.

He also sugge ted that a n 
attacker with persona l motives 
may have used the connect io n 
betwee n Rogers and the Vin-
cennes' downing of an Iranian 
jetliner last July 3 as a way of 
placing the blame on terrorists in 
an effort to elude authorities. 

Di cussing what he feels the 
United States' retaliation for ter-
rorist acts should be, Lakoff said , 
" If the attempt [on Roge rs' life] 
was successful, it would be taken 
ve ry seriously [by U,S. official ] . 
But he survived, so I don't see a 
change in policy at the highest 
level. This is a 'kinder and gentler' 
nation and we don't even havc a 
secretary of defense. 

" We are being challenged by 
Iran and ( don 't think the [Bush] 
Administration will take on this 
major challenge . The nited 
States i sending no message 
except 'do as you please' becau e 
we want good relations with I ran 

and we hope, by laying low, the 
Iranian government will undergo 
a transformation," Lakoff said. 

The profes or o utlined the 
actions he feels the United Stales 
should take in retaliation for ter-
rorism on American soil. 

"The United States and her 
allie s hould employ a co mmon 
policy to prevent terrorism in the 
world . Western cou ntries should 
deny Iranian diplomats access to 
Western Alliance countries or 
ex pe l them or enforce [economic] 
anction ," he said, 

Speculating on which Ira nian 
religiou ect would be likely to 
commit a terrorist attack, Mo-

hammad Abdullah from the San 
Diego-based Islamic Foundation 
said that , "Muslim believe in 
peace and submiss ion. However, 
the Shiite believe in revolution 
and talk too much a bout politics. 

"The Shiites are followers [of 
the Ayatollah] Khomein i, ... If it 
was an Iranian terrorist group 
who co mmitted the bombing on 
Friday in La Jolla , it would defi-
nitely be members of the Shiite 
religious sect. They hold Kho-
meini above the holy Koran," 
Abdullah said , but added his belief 
that " Muslims would neve r do 
suc h a thi ng." 

Assistant Dean of tudents of 
Third College Barbara Avery 
d escribed the difficult situation of 
black American working women 
in the U.S. as resulting from the 
cycle of oppression that thei r 
comm unities are undergoing.

"Their media is attributing a

ca n communitie to unmarried 
mothers. T hey s hould not ignore 
a simple perceivable fact: that 
black teenage girls do not create

seven years." 

Sociologist Mary Ruggie, speak-
ing on Sweden's parental leave 
policies and child care programs, 
said that, "Sweden is a model 
when it comes to thinking of the 
status of women." 

According to her, 80 percent of

Davis feels that the women's 
movement has come a long way 
from its beginnings, but said that 
it must sti ll be "purged from 
racism." 

"As women of co lor, we under-
stand white women a lot beller 
than they understand us," she 
said. 

Davis made some suggestions 
for the allevia tion of [his per-
ceived problem. 

She called for "mandatory eth-
nic studies requirements for col-
lege students," and heightened 
sensitivity on the part of white 
women to black women. 

Davis did, however, tell black 
women in the audience that they 
should learn to discriminate 
between an "intentional" and an 
"unin tentional" racist, and to be 
tolerant of white ignorance of the 
plight of black women. 

Davis has a history at UCSD 
that dates baek to the late 1960s, 
when she earned an M ,A, degree 
in philosophy here. At that time 
she helped to create the first black 
student organization on campus. 

She described the Black Stu-
dent Alliance, as it was called, as 
"literally a handful of students" 
who sought to capture an identity 
that was stripped from them by 
the "melting pot ideal." 

Davis and the Black Student 
Alliance were responsible for the 
founding of Third College, then 
known as Lamumba-Zapata Col-
lege, named after both an African 
leader and a Mexican revolu-
tionary. 

Lamumba-Zapata College was 
set up, according to D avis, "to 
effectively address the needs of 
black students, C hicano students, 
and white s tudents from working 
class backgrounds." 

The unde rtaking, s he pointed 
out, was the first of its kind in 
the country.

Supercomputer Accommodates 
A Variety of Research Fields 
By REBEKAH DE N 
laff Wriler 

The San Diego Supercomputer 
Center i big, square, and worth 
$100 million. What does it do to 
malo.e it so valuable? 

It - or rather, the Cray uper-
computer in ide doe sixteen 
different thing at once. working 
24 hours a da y on research from 
a~tronomy to zoology, with count-
Ie s tops in between. 

Though the Cray i especially 
useful in solving complex physics 
and engineering problems, it has 
been used for projects a~ diverse 
as a U ni~er~ity of Wisconsin study 
on Congressional voting patterns 
and a cripp analy~is of the 
ocean floor. 

UCSD re earchers are currentl) 
using the Supercomputer to study 
models to describe high tempera-
ture superconductors, modeling 

high-pressure gas lasers, studying 
the structure and function of nerve 
cells. and several other projects. 

Although the Center is located 
on the UC D campus, it is largely 
funded by the ational cience 
Foundation ( F) and run by 
General Atomics Technologie, 
Inc. 

UCSD is granted about 10 per-
cent of available computer time, 
said Don Anderson, director of 
Academic computing at UC D. 
The entire UC system uses about 
half of the computer time, he 
added. 

"We can't be con idered as get-
ting a bad deal out of it ," Ander-
son said. 

Intere led re~earchers apply to 
the I F for computer time. The 
propo ab are reviewed, and the 

. project chosen are typically 
granted time free of charge to the 
user. 

Most researchers surveyed ~ald 

UCSD is granted approximately 10 percent of the available time on 
the supercomputer. 

Rubes By Leigh Rubi'n 

"Lookie here, Leroy. That swell real estate feller that 
sold us the bridge in Brooklyn threw in this collector's 
edition wall print for only $25 extra!" 

if the power ofa supercomputer i 
really needed for a project , it is 
rarely difficult to get time on the 
machine. 

"Sure, we could always use 
more than we get," Ander on 
aid . "But that's true with any 

project. " 
It is difficult. Anderson said, to 

compare projects in one discipline 
with those in another, and to dis-
tribute the computer resources 
fairly among them. The NSF is 
considering freezing the current 
distribution of time, 0 the per-
centage each department is grant-
ed would not change from present 
levels. 

Physics proposals. for exam-
ple, would only compete for time 
against ot her physic projects, 
with roughly 20 percent of the 
available time et a ide for phy -
ics . Currently, Anderson said, a 
proposal is compared with pro-
jec t ~ in every ot her discipline. 

"There' an obvious danger in 
freezing distribution, " Anderson 
aid. The number of worthwhile 

projects in the different fields 
could drastically change from year 
to year, he ex plamed. 

A~ <:om puters become more 
powerful. they allow completely 
new types of re earch to develop. 
Projects that were impractical or 
impossible a few year ago can 
now be developed . 

The Cray's chief attraction is it 
speed. It can accomplish in min-
utes what would take a personal 
computer hours or even days to 
complete. 

I n orne cases, such as a UC 
an Francisco tudy on enzyme 

inhibitiors, the ideas for the re-
search were known for years, but 
the technology to implement them 
was only recently developed. 

In ot her cases, like the" Monte 
Carlo mathematics," which tests 
millions of random solutions in 
order to solve nonlinear equa-
tions, most of the current research 
would be impractical on a smaller 
machine. 

"Supercomputer," said Daniel 
Drobnis, engineering and opera-
tions manager at the Center, "sim-
ply means the most powerful com-
puter around ." The Center uses 
smaller, "mini-supercomputer " 
along with the $15 million Cray. 

orne universities are buying 
their own mini-supercomputers" 
which cost approximately 
$100,000. These comp uters have 
one fifth of the Cray's power. 

The lower level of power is mit-
igated by having full use of the 
machine, said Bob Brown, depart-
ment head of chemical engineer-
ing at the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technolgy. Brown uses an 
Argent minicomputer along with 
the supercomputer. He says the 
smaller machines in no way re-
place the su percomputers, but are 
a valuable addition to them. 

Time really is money, on the 
upercomputer. About 10 percent 

of the operating hours are pur-
chased by private industires. An 
hour of computer time costs be-
tween $1.000 and $1,800. 

The La Jolla Aerojet Co. uses 
I he Cray for Strategic Defense 
1 nitiative research (specifically, 
advanced satellite sensor systems) 
and in designing hypersonic speed 
aircrafts, which would fly at five 
times the speed of sound, accord-
ing to George Cagala, Aerojet 
communications manager.

Irish Celebrate Legend 
OJ Saint Patrick 
By MAUREEN SPURR 
Slaff Wriler 

G reen beer. Pinches. Sham-rocks. Leprechauns. We 
could be"wide as a gate" 

and sti/l.go along with it, without 
even knowing why. 

S!. Patrick. He was nowhere 
near being a "bit of a molly" or a 
"white cur." British by birth, he 
lived from A.D . 390-461, born in 
a western town of Ireland called 
Bannaverm Taburmiae. His early 
years were spent "knowing not of 
a true god," until one day he got 
captured. Irish pirates made him 
a British slave, in a location 
unknown, lending herds for six 
years. He began to pray. 

In a dream he dreamt of being 
soon returned to his own country. 
He escaped, had various adven-
tures including starvation, and 
eventually persuaded sai lors to 
return him home to his own coun-
try, his own family: Ireland. 

He was a little different when 
he came back . He went into the 
seminary, became a priest like his 
grandfather, and eventually a 
bishop. Around the year 435 he 
worked in mostly Northern Ire-
land , elll " uraging people to be-
come ml '<.s and nuns. He was 
one who \ .. ,s ready for imprison-
ment or dc.!ath in order to follow 
Christ. He is the one whom all the 
I rish say, "brought Christianity to 
Ireland . " 

Legends about t. Patrick in-
clude his driving all of the snakes 
out of Ireland, as well as his plant-
ing of the shamrock as a symbol 
of the Holy Trinity. "Shamrock" 
i A nglicved from the word, ~Seam­
rog, "which means "trefoil" (three-
led!). Green is the symbol of hope 
in many churches today. 

He wa~ called sincere, possess-
II g a i"11"licit of /(jeep pastor 1 

care. In addition, he did not 
believe in distinguishing between 
social classes. He was a scholar, 
though untutored; he was some-
one who was concerned with the 
abolishment of paganism, idola-
try, and un worship. 

His writings, including "Con-
fessional" (his autobiography), 
'Letter to Coroticus" (protesting 
against British slave-trading), and 
"Lorrica," were considered the 
first literature recognized by the 
British church which "revealed a 
scale of values and type of activity 
of interest." 

St. Patrick established churches 
and chools in Ireland, having at 
least eight ancient churches in 
Pembrookshire, Ireland , dedi-
cated to him. St. Patrick's cathed-
ral in New Y.ork is a principal 
example of dedication to him. He 
was canonized in approximately 
9 or 10 A.D. 

A parade and Irish festival at 
Balboa Park commemorate St.

Baseball 
The ninth-ranked Tritons split 

their fifth doubleheader in as 
many tries on Saturday when 
they beat La Verne 5- 1 in the 
opening game but then fell 10-8 in 
the nightcap. UCSD is currently 
10-6, and now owns a 5-3 record. 

Triton Rick Rupkey picked up 
his fifth win without any defeats 
in the first game, and he received 
help from Karl Friedl's two for 
four performance. 

In the second game, UCSD's 
hitting heroics from catcher Gene 

orthway (two homers) and hris 
Murphy (three for three , two-run 
homer) were not enough to over-
come the Leopards, who scored 
three run in the bottom of the 
eighth to put the game away. 

The Tritons host Occidental on 
Saturday.

doubter by accumulating seven 
saves and allowing only one goal. 
On Thursday evening, the Tritons 
outlasted Manhattanville, a tra-
veling east coast team, 9-4 in a 
non-conference matchup. 

The top ranked Tritons will 
host Arizona State after vacation 
as they gear up for the Western 
Regional playoffs. 

w. Crew 
Continued rrom pace 24 
for the novice A boat, which 
blazed down the bay ahead of 
UCS Band SBCC. Halfway down 
the course, UCSB tried to sprint 
and close the gap, but the Tritons 
refused to give ground and shot 
over the finish line first. 

UCSD's exhilaration melted 
away as it lost the final three 
races: novice B fell victim to a 
Gaucho sprint, varstiy B ran out 
of gas and was humbled by a five-
second margin, and novice light-
weights were frustrated in the last 
500 meters, losing by two seconds . . 

The women's crew team has 
two weeks to regroup and refine 
before the San Diego Crew Clas-
sic, March 3 I-April I at Mission 
Bay.

The Tritons were led by John

half instead of hi normal full-
back position . Tellenbach ac-
counted for 12 points as he con-
verted two penalty kick s and one 
extra point, and scored the first 
try of the game. The picture per-

The Final Four 
PHIL'S ANALYS IS " , Whew, I didn't think I'd 

ever see the day when I could finally write the words 
"The Final Four" without having to worry about a 
lawsuit. Why? Well , the NCAA has copyrighted the 
words "The Final Four" to be used only for the 
NCAA Division I basketball tournament , and nothing 
else, Stupid. Anyway, the 64-team pairings just came 
out , so here are my picks to reach the Final Four in 
Seattle the weekend before we return to school. In the 
Midwest, take Syracuse to avoid the upset while llli-
noi fall early, In the Southwest, North Carolina 
should prevail despite a tough Michigan team and an 
even tougher Oklahoma team, In the East, a ferocious 
Georgetown squad will breeze through an easy region 
(it must be lame if Stanford is seeded third), and my 
dark horse pick will be Seton Hall in the West. Ariz-
ona? I'm choking already. So, for the Final Four, I'm 
gonna be serious for once to . ee how quickly my 
record drops to 14-10-1. Phil says

SDSU was able to take adva n-
tage of matchup differences on 
numerous occasions and stru ng 
together runs of points. The Trit-
ons, however, go t tuck in a cou-
ple of rotations where they found 
themselves outmatched on the 
frontline and could not manage a 
sideout or a sco re. These situa-
tions see med to frustrate the 
UCS D team. 

" We eem to wait for the ot her 
tea m to take the match away from 
us," sa id Childers. " We have to 
get more aggressive, and not get 
down on ourselves." Despite 
the losses, UCSD (3-14) remains 
ranked nineteenth nationally. 
UCSD will break for finals and 
spring break before returning to 
play matches in the Pacific Coast 
Vo lleyball Conference. 

" We're going to handle all thi 
[1 0 ing] in a positi ve way," Head 
Coach Digger Graybill said, 
" We're playing the to ughest teams 
around and lea rning we ca n play 
them well. All these tough matches 
against tough teams will make us 
a better squad for our conference 
play in April. " 

"After the break, we will get to 
play some teams that we'l be 
better than," Childers said . "So 
it could be a whole different story. 
We could go undefeated the rest 
of the way."

Women's Tennis Falls to Western Michigan on Previous Day Men's Tennis Bounces Back 
and Thrashes Drew University Tritons Rebound to Mash Idaho 

By DA VID POTI HA 
Slaff Writer 

When we were kids, we all used 
to play on ce-saws, enjoying life's 
simple ups and downs. In sport , 
however, if one i on the see-saw, 
it is a lot more fun being the 400 
pound opponent than sitting 
across from one. This weekend , 
the UCSD women' tennis team 
was able to experience both 
feelings . 

Friday afternoon the Triton 
lost to Divi ion [ W e tern Michi-
gan, 8-1. ot very happy about 
being at the bottom of the see-
saw, even if it was only for a day, 
the Tritons made their pre ence 
felt and bounced back fo r a vic-
tory against another Division [ 
opponent, the U niver ity ofIdaho 
on aturday. Interestingly enough, 
UCSD won by the same margin 
by which it had been defeated, 
- I. 

"Ye terday our opponent was a 
lot tougher, the girls weren) ready 
for such a strong opponent. ~ Head 
Coach Liz LaPlante pointed out 
after aturday' win . he aid 
that the Division III competition 

UCSD had faced recent ly was not

the kind of challenge that would

prepare the team for strong Div-
i ion I opponents. 

On Friday, the women did not 
start off pla yi ng very well. 
LaPlante noticed that "by the 
econd sets of our matches the 

girls wcre pla yi ng better." This 
trend continued into Saturday's 
match, where the Tritons turned 
out to be too much for their Di v-
i ion 1 opponent. 

In a turday's match. the team 
was one injury away from a 9-0 
sweep. Had a ncy Calhoun , 
playing number two singles, not 
pulled a mu e1e in the tart of the 
third set, the odds are that she 
would have won. This would have 
given the Tritons the 9~ victory. 
However, she had to withdraw, 
unable to fi ni h. 

" It wa a good match, we killed 
them ,~ Rhonda Meier said. She 
felt that compared to Friday's 
match the team "had a better atti-
tude out there , we were more into 
it ." LaPlante thought the team 
wwas more relaxed ." 

Explaining why the Tritons 
were paired against two Division 
1 opponents in one weekend, 
LaPlante aid "they make their 
spring break trips out here, and it 
makes even better sense to win, 
and the Tritons certainly shrugged 
off their Friday loss to post an 
impressive victory Saturday. 

The Tritons are currently 6-3, 
and look to improve their record 
in the near future . The Tritons' 
schedule lightens up a bit , as they 
will face primarily Division III 
competition from here on out.

By CARIN RESNICK 
Staff Writer 

[f the players on UCSD's 
tepnis team doubted their abil-
ities after being defeated on 
Wednesday at the hands of 
Western Michigan, they have 
stopped doubting now. Thurs-
day, the Tritons rebounded 
and annihilated Drew Uni-
versity. 

Against Western Michigan, 
a top Division 1 team, UCSD 
struggled unsuccessfully and 
lost 7-2 . Triton Chris Belloli 
(No. 3) outlasted Karl Krauter 
2-6,6-4, 7-6 in singles and later 
partnered wi~h Sig Huber for a 
6-2 , 6-3 doubles victory, to 
give UCSD its only win of the 
day. 

What a difference a day 
makes, because Thursday the 
Tritons could do no wrong. 
Without giving up a single set" 
UCSD thrashed Drew Univer-
sity 9~. 

Francois Monnar, the Tri-
tons'top seed, struggled through 
the first set but powered past 
Tyler Gibson 7-6, 6~ for the 
win. "[ had a tough match yes-
terday and that carried over 
into my fir t et ... I was back to 
normal by the second set," 
Monnar explained . 

Second-seeded Sig Huber, 
on the other hand, barely broke 
a sweat while dominating Mark 
Rush 6-2, 6-[. Huber, also 
rebounding irom a loss the

his performance. "It was the 
best I've played in a while ... 1 
needed it," he commented . 

Points piled up as UCSD 
dominated Drew: Chris Bello[i 
ripped past Steve Rush 6-3, 6-
I, Jeff French coasted by Buck 
Zeman 6-[ , 6~, John Park 
shunned Dave Kaplan 6-2, 6-4, 
and A[an Yap iced the cake 
with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Chip 
Miller. 

UCS D's singles triumphs 
were equaled by their destruc-
tion in the doubles bracket. 
Monnarteamed with Huberto 
walk over Rush and Rush 6-1 , 
6- 1, Belloli and French pre-
vailed over Gibson and Michael 
6-3, 6-2, and Park and Yap 
thwarted Miller and Fahns 6-
2, 6-4. 

The win brings the Tritons 
record to 4-7 on the season, 
but records do not tell the 
entire story. UCSD currently 
holds the country's number 
five ranking for Division III. 

As Triton Head Coach JOil 
Hammermeister pointed out, 
his team is entering the core of 
lhe season. "Eleven of our thir-
teen matches are against Div-
ision II [ schools. These matches 
will determine our postseason 
possibilities," he added. 

On Wednesday, March 15, 
the Tritons host the University 
of Rochester, a top 10 Division 
III team, at 3 p.m.

The Triton men' crew team 
produced it own ver ion of "The 
Go d,the Badandthe gly"a it 
raced against anta Barbara 
and anta Barbara City College 
thi weekend at Mi ion Bay. 

"The Good" began aturday 
with the novi e B boat. The Trit-
on. immediatel. took a lead on 
LI B and maintained it dow n 
the :!OOO-meter cour t' . The last 
500 meter!>, the aucho. launched 
a strong sprint, but UC D held 
tough and finished two eat up. 

Brian Morris/ GLiurdioll 
Fog CuHer - The women s novice A boat shone through despite a tough week for UCSD crew. 

. To get an accurate feel of the 
weekend for the Triton women's 
crew team, think of the Collossu 
ro ller coa ter at Magic Moun-
tain . Again t the Univer tiy of 
Southern a li fro nia, anta Bar-
bara Ci ty ollege, and anta 
Barbara, the T rit ons had their 
share of en a tional high and 
heartbreaking low. 

F-or the varsit) hea\y\",eight~. 
how e\ er, things took a turn to the 
bad During warm-up on thc 
\\ater, Tnton evcn cat Da\c 
Barry was removed from the shell. 
Ha\ ing not pra ticed for day due 
to a back injury, Barr) tned to 
row , but wa un:ucce ful in hi 
attempt. 

Vi ibly dIsappointed, the \ar-
It) hea\ yweight wcre compellcd 

to . ra tch from the race. Thc boat 
has the opportunity for a rematch 
whcn it meet anta Barbara in a 
heat in the . an Diego rev" 
Classic. 

:-':ext, things turned ugl ,as thc 
\ar ity lightweight went head on 
against C B' lightweights, the 
defending Pacific Coa!.t champ-
ion . Both boats hot off the line 
and battled neck-and-neck down 
the course. 

At 1000 meter the Triton!. 
started mo\ ing through the Gau-
chos and taking eah .. anta Bar-
bara retaliated , picking up the 
pa e \",ith a \ igorous print, and 
charged ahead. 

As both boats neared the finish 
line, C B veered to\\ards the 
hore and cut the Triton off. 
ox wains creamed to each other 

"hold your point," but D 
wa forced to werve. 

• anta Barbara fini hed two 
e ond ahead of C'. D with a 

time 6: 16, but Triton Cox wain 

Dana ohcn astutely rcmained at 
the finish and launched a protest. 
The officiab, however called it 
"mutual blame," citing both boatl. 
for lea\ ing thcir re pective lanes, 
and the re 'ult stood. 

Quickly forgetting the 10 , 
UC D came back to "the Good" 
and won the final two race ofthc 
morning. 

The novicc lightweight , intent 
on making the day a novice weep, 
jumped ahead of CS B earl a nd 
held tight. the Gaucho \l ent 
into their print. D lost a few 
eat but fini hed hard and won 

with a boat length to ·pare.

One of the e day, the Tritons 
ju t might do it - one of these 
days, they j u t might get over the 
hump. 

The C D men' volleyball 
team continues to play the elite 
team tough, but is not able to put 
a match away . Saturday night. it 
happened again when C 0 fell 
to ninth-ranked an Diego State 
14-16.12-15,12-15. 

After close 10 es to eighth-
ranked Ball State and fourteenth-
ranked Indiana Purdue niver-
sity - ort Wayne during the 
week, the Triton ' seemed read) to 
break through with a big upset 
against their crosstown rival. 

Thcy entered the match fired up 
and jumped to an early 6-1 lead 
and even held a 14-12ad antage 
and were erving to win the game, 
but could not comert. The ztec 
ran off four straight point to take 
the first game. 

Ha ing come clo e in the fir t 
game, the Tritons seemed almost 
content to play the Anecs close 
the re t of the way - which they 
did . 

"I thought we had them down," 
setter John Childers said . "But we 
got down on our elves and wnen 
we do that , we have trouble com-
ing back up against top teams. 
We're getting too used to loing." 

The Triton continue to play 
good "ideout v olley ball, but are 
till haVIng trouble putting point 

on the board when it countS .This 

wa no more evident than in game 
two. Trailing 14-11 at one point, 
the Tritons played in pired defen-
sive volleyball by saving four game 
point. Still, they were una ble to 
put more than one poi nt o n the 
board during that time, a nd even-
tually fell, 15-12. 

In the third ga me, the T ritons 
found them elve in a deep hole 
when SD held a 13-7 ad an-
tage and was looking to serve out 
t he conte t. But the Tritons scored 
the next five points to pull withi n 
13-12 before lipping again a nd 
losing the game and the match 
15-12. 

" It ' one thing to be close," 
power attacker Nick Rothman 
said. " But there's a big differe nce 
between playing close and win-
ning. " See M. V-BALL, page 19
