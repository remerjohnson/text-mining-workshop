Enough doctoral 
offerings? 

The California postsecondary 
Educa tion Commission (CPEC) 
will conduct a study of the State's 
doctoral offfenngs in educa tion , 
a move welcomed by UC 
President David P. Gardner, who 
told the Regents that "The 
Univers ity of CaJirorn ia pledges 
full cooperation and assistance to 
CPEC as it stud ies this issue." 

Garder, speaking at the 
Regents Board meeting at UC 
San Francisco, noted that CPEC's 
decison to assess the need for 
addi tional doctoral training in 
education followed action taken 
by the California State University 
(CSU) Board of Trutees in 

ovember 1985 seeking authority 
to Independently offer the 
doctoral degree in education 
(Ed.D.). 

Under the current Master Plan , 
UC has sole authority to award 
doctoral degrees CSU IS 
permmed to award the doctorate 
In hmited Joint programs with 
UC and pnvate colleges across 
the state. UC and CSU have 
currently eight jOint doctoral 
programs 

The CPEC stud y is expected

Alcohol &: drug 
course offered 

ThiS quarter, "Alcohol and 
Drug Abuse : From cells to 
Society" a new course offered by 
the Department of Psychology, 
seems to have touched a nerve 
in students. The elective 
attracted enough students to 
completely fill USB 2722. 
According to its coordinator, Dr. 
David Case, the interest did not 
really surprise him that much 
because the original Impetus for 
offering the class actually came 
from students and ACUCSD 
representatives. 

The course features guest 
lecrures by 14 local "experts" on 
the topic in several research 
disciplines, counseling and other 
relevant pOSitions and was 
designed to present a variety of 
perspectives 

Asked why he thought so 
many students wanted to enroll , 
Case replied , "I can only 
speculate , but responses to a 
survey of auitudes conducted in 

the first class meenng suggest 
that , under the right 
circumstances, as many as a 
third to half of the students 
might experiment with drugs 
they heard about but never tned . 
This IS a striking indication of 
attitudes and CUriosity, nOl only 
because thiS would be a Violation 
of the law, but because students 
seem aware that there may be 
other risks to uch 
experimentation . There also 
seems to be puzzlement about 
the nature of addiction as well as 
concem in being able to 
recognize and avoid it without 
completely abstaining. 

Two particularly notewonhy 
sessions scheduled in the 
syllabus are by vice chancellor of 
undergraduate affairs, Dr. joseph 
Watson , who will speak on 
UCSD alcohol and drug policies 
and helping services, and a 
debate between the national 
director of MADD (Mothers 
Against Drunk Driving) and a 
criminal defense lawyer who 
specializes in driving-while-
intoxicated cases.

Shop- talk swappe~ 

Roles of the executives 
By NIKI NEWLANDS, Associate News Editor 

T OP ADVISORS TO six U.s. presidents ranging from Dwight D. Eisenhower 
through jimmy Carter assembled 
Friday at UCSD to discuss and 
exchange anecdotes from their 
administrations. 

While the advisors 
acknowledged that they had 
differing styles and methods of 
conducting business, they agreed 
there is great advantage in 
passing on their knowledge to 
future chiefs of staff, if only to 
give them insight into how 
others handled the job. 

john Chancellor, NBC 
commentator who served as 
modemtor Friday, posed several 
questions about crisis 
management. Should you awaken 
the president at 2 a.m. or not? 
How much do you tell them and 
when? 

Harry McPherson of the Johnson 
Administration, said, "Reagan 
slept through the Gulf of Persia 
- Meese didn't wake him up -
but johnson would have been 
furious! " 

The evolution of technology 
has greatly affected the decision-
making process of the chief of 
staff, Alexander Haig, from the 
Nixon and Ford Administrations, 
said . "It brings the American 
public immediately abreast and 
can endanger the president'S 
ability to make rational 

decisions. " 
jack Watson , Carter's chief of 

staff, remembered the Three Mile 
Island c risis. "Putting the 
President in front of the public 
would have elevated the crisis," 
he said. Carter was kept 
informed "internally, nOt 
publically." 

Donald Rumsfeld . from the 
Ford Administration , described 
how Ford and his advisors had 
direct communication with a 
U.S. pilot who new over the 
scene of the capmre of the U.S. 
merchant ship Mayaguez by the 
Cambodian govemment. As they 
sat in one room, the pilot 
described what he saw over a 
squawk box in the next room. 

"I see people on it," Rumsfeld 
recalled the pilot saying. "They 
look like Caucasians. They are 
halfway to shore." 

"Then everybody looked at the 
president," Rumsfeld said , 
waiting for the president'S 
decision on whether to recapture 
the crew or wait. 

"It's filthy the way technology 
has put a president in that 
position ," he concluded. 

When the discussion turned 
to what the advisors might have 
done differently to help guide 
their adminstrations through 
difficult moments in history, 
McPherson , Johnson's 
administrator, said that among 

other things he would have tried 
to transform Johnson 's television 
image into something more like 
Reagan's-"A war leader instead 

of a Methodist biShOp manque." 
These key presidential 

advisors were among eight who 
participated in the first day of a 
two-day session. In addition to 
McPherson, Haig, Rumsfeld and 
Watson, panelists were Andrew 
Goodpaster, from the Eisenhower 
Administration; Theodore 
Sorenson, from the Kennedy 
Administration; H.R Haldeman, 
chief of staff in the Nixon 
Administration; and Richard 
Cheney, Ford Administration 
aide. 

Reportedly in order to prevent 
politiCS from pervading the 
attempt at sharing hiStory, and 
also to prevent any current 
officials from being placed on 
the sPOt, no current 
representatives of the Reagan 
Administration were invited. 

Approximately 20 students 
gathered at the entrance to the 
Mandell Weiss Theatre to protest 
the forum , calling it an act of 
"disinformation" intended to 
mislead the public about the 
university'S connection with the 
military and govemment. 

Organizers of the "Rally for 
People's History" led a peaceful 
demonstration to the beat of 
bongos, maracas and an empty 

Sorenson (ja r leJt) turns heads with his adamant-support oj small staffs. 

water bottle. Many protestors, 
several on -lookers and even a 
few policemen swayed to the 
rhythmiC music. 

The afternoon session , which 
was open to public questions, 
included topiCS discussed earlier, 
such as the size of the 
preSidential staff. "What 
limitations should be enforced?" 
asked Brad Peterson of Brookes 
Instirute. 

Rumsfeld said that there is a 
namral tendency for staffs to 
grow - presidents have 
different needs. He said , "A lot of 
that (extra staff members) should 
be shoved OUt: 

Haig said that the growth of 
the president'S staff is · paralleled 
by growth of the congreSSional 
staff. The White House has to 
respond to that behemoth." 

An advocate of a smaller staff, 
Sorenson said that large staffs 
"do not represent the president 
to the country, but rather the 
country to the preSident. That's 
wrong." 

The panel was unanimous in 
their agreeme nt that a strong 
White House staff is prefe rable 
to an a ttempt at making a 
decision within the inner 
sanctum. 

Chancellor asked WatsOn . 
"You would have had a Donald 
Regan in the Carte r White 
House?" 

"Yes, I'm suggesting a strong, 
trusted , evenhanded White 
House c hief of staff," Watson 
said, "I think the president was 
involved in tOO many things. I 
think we PUt tOO many things on 
the agenda." 

On the second and final day 
of the two-day seminar the 
chiefs of staff met with 
prominent scholars and media 
representatives who have been 
studying and covering the White 
House and its politics over the 
past two and a half decades. 

The discussion was hosted by 
UCSD political science professor 
Sam Kernell , who teaches a

King for more than a day 
By DAVID S, BRODER 

The official celebration of Manin Luther 
King's binhday here will center on the 
dedication Monday of a statue to the civil-
rights leader in Kelly-Ingram Park. It stands 
'across from the 16th Street Baptist Church, 
where King and the others came in the 
spring of 1963 to liberate what he was to call 
"a community in which human rights had 
been trampled for so long that fear and 
oppression were as thick in its atmosphere as 
the smog from its factories." 

The legacy of those dramatic days can be 
found everywhere in today's "Magic City," but 
especially in the basement of the Linn-Henley 
Research Library and on the third floor of the 
nearby City Hall . 

In the basement office, a gentle, white-
bearded white man, city archivist Charles 
Whiting, opens a file from a cardboard box 
containing the confidential reports that went 
to police chief Jamie Moore from the officers 
who monitored King's church meetings. 

"It's a miracle we have these ," Whiting 
said. "In 1979, my assistant, Bob Corley, and 
I were going through a mountain of recorder's 
court files that had been dumped on the 
second floor of an abandoned fire station. 
His foOt slipped .. . he had kicked over a 
transfer canon with the files of those 
surveillance reports." 

In the cold prose of these hostile white 
officers' repons, one can recapture the power 
of the movement that transformed this city 
and America. On April 8 , 1963, for example, 
officers BA. Allison and R.A. Watkins went to 
the First Baptist Church and found it so 
jammed that they called the fire marshal, who 
forced some of the crowd to leave . Then, as 
they wrote: 

"Rev. C.W. Woods got up and made an 
appeal saying that .. . last Wednesdav when he , 

was sitting in at the lunch counters that some 
white men came up and stood behind him. 
He said, 'When 1 looked around one of them 
spit in my face . 1 looked at him and smiled. 
All of us should be willing to give something.' 

'Then they took up a collection ... the 
choir was singing, 'I Am Bound for the 
Freedom Land.' Manin Luther King made his 
grand entrance at approximately 8: 15 to a 
standing ovation. 

"Rev. Y.T. Walker got up and said that 
Sunday when they was in the park that he 
was just a few feet from this Negro that the 
police dogs got a hold of, a nonviolent Negro. 
He said that five police dogs had to subdue 
this man and he said that it was a sin and a 
shame that the police had to sic dogs on 
these nonviolent Negroes .. . He ranted and 
raved for some time .... 

"Manin Luther King was the next speaker. 
He said , The movement is really moving ... .' 
He said that it was probably the largest 
meeting held since these demonstrations had 
staned a week ago. He said that he came 
down here to go to jail for freedom and it's 
better to go to jail in dignity than to accept 
segregation. He appealed to the Negroes to 
stay out of downtown to shop. . .. He 
criticized the police on their brutality toward 
Negroes. He said that churches and homes 
have been bombed and nothing has been 
done about it. He appealed to the Negroes to 
go to jail tomorrow. We are going to fill all 
the jails in Birmingham. We are going to tum 
Birmingham upside down and right side up.''' 

The reporters go on day after day, and the 
bafflement of the officers grows as they 
confront the irresistible force of nonviolent 
protest. By April 26, they are reporting that 
"Rev. Shut.tlesworth told the people that Judge 
Jenkins was afraid to put them in jail this 

morning .... Manin LY'ther King ... said 
that ... people realize a jail can't stop a 
movement .... He said that people aU over the 
United States were ready to mobilize a force 
if we were in jail and were going to march on 
Washington next Wednesday." 
. From the basement reading room it is just 

a shon walk to the bright third-floor office in 
City Hall where a quiet black zoology 
professor, Richard Arrington, has sat as mayor 
since 1979. 

"Everyone knows what King did to 
Birmingham," he said the other day. "He held 
up its practices to the world's examinations 
and forced it to come to grips with its 
conscience. But only those of us in 
Birmingham (really) know what he did for 
Birmingham. He allowed us, black and white, 
to communicate for the first time and to 
recognize our common goals." 

It would be nice to end on that upbeat 
note-but false . Arringron said , "it pains me" 
that the suburban schools-predominantly 
white-will nOt close to honor King's 
birthday, as the city schools do. "And it pains 
me, toO," he said , that Birmingham's effort to 
desegregate its police, fire and civil service 
dep,mments is still being harassed by veteran 
white city employees-some of whom served 
with the men who wrote those 1963 reports. 

Encouraged by the Reagan Administration, 
they are back in court seeking to block 
affirmative-action hiring and promotion of 
blacks. So far, they have failed . But their effort 
to roll back history continues, aided by what 
we cQoose to caU, with unintended irony, the 
u.s. Depanment of Justice.

Doublespeak 

Editor: 
In the Jan . 16 Issue of the 

Guardian I read an article which 
angered me . After descnbing the 
previous evemng's AS. meeting. 
it was reponed that a " ... UCSD 
alumnus aSSOCiated with the new 
indicator and A1umm Agamst 
Apartheid ... said , 'Sleg Hell .' 
Does anyone but me think that's 
a little strange7 "Sieg Heil" is a 
salute to the segregation policies 
by the Gennan state of the 1930s 
and 1940s. They are words to be 
used very, very carefully, for 
there are few situations in which 
they are not offensive . I think 
Mr. Kroopkm might be well 
adVIsed to look up the word 
"apartheid" m the dictionary. As 
a representative of the altemauve 
media on campus, his public 
remarks should at least be based 
on cogent thought.

Flip, flop. flip , , , , 
Editor: 

I feel compelled to reply to 
Kathy & ckett's letter to the 
editor (Jan. 6, 1986) 10 which 
she attempts to refute my Dec. 5 
leue.r conceming the proposed 

UCSD Women's Resource 
Center. I maintained the nammg 
of the cemer was detrimental to 
the image of women in that we 
cannot claim equality and an 
exclusive list of needs at the 
same time Beckett disagrees 
with my stance, but I found so 
little substance in her supporting 
statements, that I see no need to 
change it. 

First. I am well aware of what 
the women's resource center is 
"designed" to do, and to that 
end I thmk it a noble cause. My 
argume nt was, and still is, that 
there will be unrealized 
ramifications caused not so 
much by the center Itself, as by 
its name. If Ms. Beckett believes I 
am the only person who would 
interpret the name of the center 
as a sugma for our gender. I can 
assure her I know several 
thinking people who concur with 
my opinion. 

Secondly, 10 an attempt to 
avoid using the tenn "women's 
issue ." a tenn I hoped to bamsh 
10 my first letter, Ms. Beckett 
resorts to diplomatic phrases, 
such as "Issues that pnmarily 
affect them," ("them" meanmg 
women of course). ThiS is Just 
another way of saymg "woman's 
Issue ," only less effiCIently. 

I have been pondering the 
question of gender speCifiC 

Issues, trying long and hard to 
come up with eve n one. I have 
failed . I cannot think of a single 
Issue which primanly affects only 
women. For every female rape 
victim. I can think of the male 
rapist. the victim's father, 
brother(s), boyfriend or husband . 
For every female who has not 
been raped . these same men 
have endured , like she , the fear 
that someday she might be . Yet, 
we don 't have rapist prevention 
classes for men . nor do we have 
centers that actively reach out to 
the males involved with the 
victim. Why is our handling of 
thiS Issue so myopic? Could it be 
because rape is thought of as an 
Issue which primarily affects 
women , rather than as the major 
SOCial issue It really is? I have 
been trying to dnve a point 
home. Now I want to take It 
inside and cut some hght~ on. 
The point IS women do nOI live in 
a vacuum! II!! There is no such 
thing as a "woman 's Issue ," nor 
is there an issue which affects 
primanly women. 

It's ume to Stop separating 
issues Into male and female 
camps Just look at where 
this current method of 
problem delega tion!> 
has gotten 
us . While 

we women face bomb threats ::, a 
fight for birth control rights, the 
men come home , sleep with us , 
then go out and VOle for Reagan. 
While we are trying to put 
household genns on the 
end angered species hSl, the men 
are betting on the Bears vs. 
Patriots point spread. Are we 
haVIng fu n yet? Why not? 

Maybe we got stuck With all 
the wrong Issues. Frankly, I'd like 
to give some back, or even 
better, pool all the issues and 

make them everybody's 
responsibility. 

M{Wbe what we need is not a 
"Woman's Resource Center" but 
a "Human Resource Center," 

\~hl ch would welcome every form 
df sexuality known to mankind 
to all tvork together on issues.

ypital punishment 

The execution of legal equality 
By KATHY BECKEIT, SlaffWriltr 

Pending the upcoming 
Supreme ~~rt ru.ling regarding 
the constltutlonabty of capital 
punishment, advocates and 
opponents of the death penalry 
are hotly debating the issue. In 
ques~on are the constitutionality, 
effectiveness and morality of 
death as a form of punishment. 
Inherent to the debate are such 

em~ionaUy charged issues as 
rembution, victim and defendant 
rights and the proper role of the 
st.ate. Juxtaposed are twO very 
different concert ions of the 
requirements 0 justice, the 
nature and causes of crime, and 
the most appropriate response to 
violent crime. 

The criteria delineated by the 
Supreme Court for ascenaining 
the constitutionality of capital 
punishment include the Eighth 
Amendment's prohibition of 
cruel and unusual punishment 
and .the equal protection clause 
of the 14th Amendment. 
"Arbitrary" imposition of the 
death penalty includes either 
random assignment of the 
imposition of the death penalty 
based on the presence of a 
legaDy irrelevant factor such as 
race. Research including a recent 
study by the Stanford Uw 
Review, indicates that there is a 
stable and consistent panern of 
racial discrimination in the 
assignment of the death sentence 

that .cannot be explained by 
legmmate sentencing variables. It 
has been shown that prosecutors 
art more likely to ask for the 
death penalty when the 
defendant is black, that blacks 
are more likely to receive the 
death penalty than whites and 
that blacks who kill whites are at 
greater risk than blacks who kill 
blacks. 

Another bias has been created 
by the passage of the "death 
qualification" law. In 1968, the 
Suprell)t Court ruled that 
prospective jurors who were 
opposed to the death penalty 
should not be permitted to 
part.icipate in trials involving 
capital pUnishment. According to 
cnllCS, thiS law systematicaDy 
discriminates in a direction 
against the defendant and 
undermines the values of due 
process. Recent findings 
substantiate this claim: Research 
indicates that proponents of 
capital punishment are more 
likely to determine guilt, to trust 
witnesses, to value crime control 
more than due process, to show 
punitive personality traits, to 
mistrust .lhe accused; they are 
also less able to remember the 
evidence than their counterparts. 
This study concludes that "mixed 
juries may improve the vigor, 
thoroughness, and accuracy of 
the juries deliberations." Women 

and blacks are most likely to be 
excluded from juries by vinue of 
the "death Qualification." The 
resuh is a jury that is 
unrepresentative of the values 
and population Irom which It IS 
drawn. 

for many, the effectiveness of 
capital punishment as a 

It has been shown 
that prosecutors are 
more likely to ask for 
the death penalty 
when the defendant is 
black, that blacks are 
more likely to receive 
the death penalty than 
whites" , 

deterrent to crime is the main 
determinant of its legitimacy. 
Statistics can be marshaBed to 

suppo~ t~e views of both sides. 
Whl.le tt IS true that capital 
pUnishment IS deterrent-specific 
(the. executed individual quite 
obVIously cannot kill again), it 
remains unclear that potential

murderers are dissuaded from 
commining homicide. Indeed the 
United States is the only 
Western industrialized nation 
still . utilizing t~e death penalty 
dunng peacetime; in addition, 
the homicide rate in the United 
States is from eight to 10 times 
that of Western Europe. The 
notion of deterrence requires 
that would-be murderers reckon 
with the probable cause of their 
actions. A rational assessment of 
this type is very unlikely made 
by those who are drunk, mentally 
unstable or in filS of anger -
conditions that are descriptive of 
the vast majority of homicides. 

The incongruil}' that is 
intrinsic to the message of state-
sanctioned killing cannot escape 
us. Life is so valuable, we are 
told, that we must take another. 
Certainly, the abolition of the 
death penalty would more 
consistently support and 
promote the belief that human 
life is sacred . One wonders at 
the perversity of the celebrations 
that often accompany publicized 
executions and at the coarseness 
that this sort of behavior 
indicates and facilitates. 

The media's coverage of crime 
and in particular homicide, 
greatly contributes to the desire 
for retribution. Much anention is 
paid 10 the circumstances of the 
murder, the identil}' of the victim 

and the grief of the families 
involved . This sort of 
information understandably 
promQtes fear and anger among 
the population. In the absence of 
any indepth analysis for the 
causes of crime, the desire to do 
somttl!ing takes the form of the 
advocation of capital 
punishment. The undeniable link 
between crime and poverty, 
racial tension and unemployment 
has been made invisible, and the 
solutions that these facts suggest 
are ignored . 

Fear and anger are natural 
responses to violations of what 
our society holds as the most 
basic right: the right to life. But 
the desire for what appears to be 
justice - the death of the 
wrong-doer - must be weighed 
agamst the competing claims of 
humanity and mercy. Humans 
(and jurors) are fallible; death is 
final An innocent man 
executed , cannot accep~ an 
apology. 

It remains true that a response 
is forthcoming to the problem of 
violent crime. Tolerance for 
complexity, patience and 
creativity will be necessaty if we 
are to develop alternative and 
more humane methods of 
satisfying justice and protecting 
society. The death sentence is 
not the best response our society 
can make to violent crime. 

Live the sensation 
that is ...

Looking at decades of progress 
By KAREN KAWASAKI, StaffWnter 

FOR SOME, yesterday's celebration of Martin Luther King's birthday as a 
national holiday meant nothing 
more than a relaxing day off 
from work or school. But many 
others consider the national 
observance of King's birthday a 
major advancement for American 
society. Farrel Foreman, who 
runs the OASIS Scholar's Wming 
Workshop , comments. "This is 
an imponant holiday because 
Martin Luther King was a very 
important leader. not only for 

, blacks, but for the whole country. 
The ideals that he strove for are 
ideals that we should aU strive 
for in our everyday lives." 

King. winner of the 1964 
Nobel Peace Prize , was not only 
an integral American leader, but 
also a brilliant thinker and 

emerged a strong leadcr not only 
in the communiry. but also in 
the COuntI)' . 

On Dec. 1. 1955 in 
Montogmery. Rosa Parks. a black 
seamstress. refused to give up 
her seat on a public bus to a 
white man. She was arrested and 
charged with violation of the 
Alabama City segregation codc. 
King was among the leaders of 
the black community who 
decided , after the incident, to 
call a one-day bus boycott. This 
boycott lasted 381 days. 

Throughout the boycou, King 
encouraged nonviolent and 
passive resistance . As a result, on 
Nov. 13, 1956, the Supreme 
Court declared Alabama's state 
and local laws requiring 
segregation on buses 
unconstitutional. By Dec. 20, the

registration and civil rights and 
gave speeches based on those 
philosophies. 

In a march on Washington 
held Aug. 28, 1963, King 
delivered his famous speech. "I 
Have A Dream" to a crowd of 
250,000 at the Lincoln Memorial. 
In the speech he stated: 

I haye a dream that one day this 
nation will rise up and live out the 
true meaning of its creed: We hold 
these truths to be self-evident that 
all men are created equal. I ha\IC a 
dream that one day down in 

Even in violent times. King 
still implored his followers to 
refrain from violence. He urged 
them to "meet physical force 
with soul force. Blood." he told 
them, "may flow in the streets of 
Montgomery before we receive 
our freedom, but it must be our

blood that flows and not that of 
the white man. We must not 
harm a Single hair on the head 
of our white brothers ... . When I 
go to jail, the whole world knows 
it. But when one of you goes ro 
jail and suffers brutality, no one 
knows about it. I am happy to 
suffer a Iltde .... It makes me feel 
a closer pan of you." 

activist. When he was 15. he 
entered Morehouse Colkge in 
hopes of becoming a docror. 
While at Morehouse. he decided 
instead to study for the ministry. 
In 195<J, he became a pastor for 
the Dexter Avenue Baptist 
Church in MontgOmery. Alabama. 
Towards the end of 1955, King 

city of Monrgomery had declared 
an end ro racial segregation on 
public conveyances. 

Ouring the boycOtt, King 
became interested in Indian 
\cader Mahatma Ghandi's 
philosophy of nonviolence. 
Throughout the rest of his life~ 
King \cd marches for voter

one day light tlltre in Alabama, 
little bb:h b~ and littlt blach girls 
will be able to join hands with liule 
white b~s and white girls as sisters 
and brothers .. . 

King was assassinatrd on Apr. 
4, 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee 
where he was uying to improve 
the wages and working 
conditions of sanitation workers. 
He was only 39 years old at the 
time of his death. 

South African Bishop 
Desomond Tutu, who will s~ak 

at UCSD on Thursday, is like 
King in many ways. He was born 
just two years after King and also 
had originally planned to 
become a doctor. He received 
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984. 
exactly 20 years after King 
received the same leading honor. 
Tutu practices a similar 
philosophy of nonviolence when 
leadmg South Africa's blacks 
through the current upheaval 
there . 

In an article dated Nov. 8, 
1978, Tutu states, "I write this in 
vain to set the backdrop to my 
belief - that the liberation and 
freedom of blacks in this land 
are inevitable. And the liberation 
and freedom of blacks involves 
the liberation of whites in our 
beloved country, because until 
blacks are free. the whites can 
never be really free . There is no 
such thing as separate freedom 

" - freedom is indivisible." 
.~ In a country where blacks 
" "'l make up 80 percent of the ~ population and live on 13 
" percent of the land , Tutu has d warned, "Desperate people use 

£ desperate methods. We will die 
~ as fools if we cannot learn to live 
IE together as brothers. to 

paraphrase Manin Luther King." 
Darryl Ellis, former president 

of the Black Student Union 
(BSU) and now a second year 
UCSD medical student, explains 
why King was able .to influence 
so many and accomplish so 
much: "A lot of what he stood for 
was evident in his legislation. He 
tried to get everything down in 
the books and tried to get people 
to abide by those laws." 

But Ellis has noticed that 

much of the progress and 
involvement has been "slipping 
by more and more ." at the 
national level, he says, "Peopte 
are more into their own thin~ 
than into the whole country: At 
UCSD, he sites of numerous past 
protests and racial upheawls, 
~Folks are sleeping now," he 
remarks. 

Elis believes that when he was 
an active BSU member. the 
organization was "much stronger. 
mort active and more visible. It's 
more to itself now. Many 
students a~ from assimilated 
backgrounds and many are not 
even aware of the real world and

An exploration for 
the parking nightmare 
By PHIL lAUDER 

I T IS TIME TO ATTACK the definitive social problem of our generation. It may amaze many of you that "the 
writer's i" hasn 't dealt with this one 
before . At least it amazes me. ActuaDy. I 
just thought it might go away if I 
Ignored it , but it didn·t. and it doesn't, 
and it won't. 

Quite the opposite, it spreads like a 
blot of ink from a felt tip pen dropped 
on a white pair of pants - and there's 
nothing you can do to stop it. 

Parking problems. Read them and 
weep. 

The first thought on most students' 
minds is .. . unprintable . The second 
thought is. "Why?" Why in hell do they 
have to do this to us? Why do we need 
to spend endless hours trying to get a 
spor should we be so foolish as to arrive 
on campus after 6:30 am? Why, why, 
why?!? 

Why indeed. It's quite simple. reaDy. 
Universities throughout the nation 

have a plan: "Piss ofT as many students 
as you can." This. they reason, wiD give 
these srry young bucks and buckettes a 
dose 0 the real world, which is why 
they're here in the first place. Do 
whatever it takes - spare no cut-back 
or inefficiency- just make sure you 
piss them ofT. 

As pan of the plan, they have 
coordinated the\r StafTs at the Registrar 

and the Cashier and at all academic 
department otTi ces to maximize both 
waiting time and run-around for 
students desperate to avoid both. They 
have written up financial aid forms in a 
language as close to Gaelic as they can 
legally get away with. They have taken 
the information about the voluntary $3 
donation for CalPIRG off the registration 
form , then put It back on, then taken it 
off again until everyone is hopelessly 
confused. All pan of the plan. 

And, after decades in the business, 
universities have discovered there is one

fool-proof, absolute best way to piss 
students off: Provide one-third of the 
necessary parking on each campus. And 
that's the plan they stick with. 

A fellow worker named David came 
into the office the other day in about as 
upset a mood as he gets. His words 
were something like . "Golly gee am I 
miffed ," and the scene turned into an 
E.F. Hutton commercial as his 
workmates cupped their earS in 
anticipation of the explanation of his 
hysteria. He began by saying that he 
trics to never miss a lecture, but that 
after arriving on campus before his 10 
am class. he spent the next gosh dang 
hour and a half roaming the parking 
lots in search of a lone spot to squeeze 
hiS pickup into. First he tried near his 
lecture hall . then a little bit further away, 
then he tried La Mesa and finaDy 
Albuquerque. He missed his class. He 
was pissed . 

simply cannot be happening. A feeling 
wells up deep inside your body. It starts 
as a shot of adrenaline, but it grows in 
scope and intensity through your guts, 
into your lungs. past your aching throat, 
right up to your brain. You want to 
scream. 

And you do: 
"AAAAAAAAAHHHHHH !! '" The results? 
None if your car windows are rolled up 
or if you're the only one left in the 
computer lab . Strange looks of 
amusement or pity otherwise. If a 
university official is within earshot of 
your panic. you might catch the bum 
flashing an ear-to-fdr grin of approval as 
he or she scribbles something into the 
record book. Another success. By the 
way. these people are prOtected by 
undercover armed guards, so don't get 
any ideas. You're .expendable . believe 
me. This plan is bigger than all of us. 

In my experience, the only feeling 
that comes close to the terror generated 
by spend ing your lecture time searching 
for a parking Spot that doesn't exist is 
the one.that comes at 3 in the morni ng 
plodding desperately through a 
computer printout in hopes of spotting 
the source of a run -time error that 

Parking officials will , of course, deny 
everything. "There are plenty of spots 
around - no. really. there are. It·s just a 
matter of finding them. [Standard line 
#249.1 Why did we sell 20 and 50 and 
80% more permits than there are 
parking spaces? You don 't understand 
- that's standard policy; we do that

are trying to do well in their

admission requirements. That 
has dissuaded a lot of students 
from coming here (UCSD)." 

Affirmative Action has opened 
up many new opportunities for 
those who otherwise might not 
have been able to auend college. 
Karia explains that although "it 
has helped in trying to address

Ellis, like Koria , encourages

thmk a lot of gains have been 
made so far. The role of black 
students on campus is to take a

we need more diSCipline, and 
UCSD is too much like a damn 
country club. Besides, the 
conditions of the fields were 
terrible last year. We'll go to 
where we can get the proper 
atmosphere." 

Rumors surfaced last week that 
the Chargers were considering 
changing their annual training

Teele, assistant to the president 

(at Warren College) were the

June," Teele said, "because we

Proposed housing and dining

Chargers' management. Teele

For Marshall, basketball

U CSD's BASKETBALL coach , Tom Marshall , hated his Job in the 
service so much that he swore 
when he got out he would never 
work again. He said ,his next 
employm.ent would be "enjoyable 
to the point where it wasn't 
work." 

"I love what I do. I wake up in 
the morning wanting ro go ro

position dear." 
Although Teele admitted that 

the Chargers were not happy 
with the field and this year's 
developments , he did not feel 
that UCSD had breached the 
contract. "We've never had any 
problems before ," Teele said, 
"UCSD has always dealt above 
board and fairly with us. If these 
problems can be resolved, we'll 
be back again. Meanwhile, just in 
case. we felt that we should have 
an altemative sire available, and 
that's why we took the SDSU 
tour.'1 

Van Jahnes-Smith. UCSD's 
business manager. would 
comment on the situation only 
enough to say that "we're in the 
process of negotiating a new 
contract and I'm not at liberty to 
discuss them (the negoliations).n 
Smith was quoted in the Union 
as saying that the Chargers have 
paid approximately $60,000 a 
year for their annual five-week 
stay at UCSD. "It's been basicaUy 
a 'what-it-costs-us-it-costs-you' 
thing with the Chargers," Smilh 
told the Union, "It's been a break-
even thing; it has never been a 
profit-making venture." 

Chargers will 'go wktrt we can get the proper atmosphere' -~r Alex Spanos 

"We could make a profit on it 
(the proposed move to SDSU)," 
SDSU's associate athletic director 
Al Luginbill told the Union, "It's 
fully feasible that the facilities 
here at San Diego State could 
even be helped by having the 
Chargers here for the preseason, 

The profits would go into the 
university general fund , but there 
is no reason the monies we get 
from it couldn't go toward 
(improving) our facilities." 

Guardian that "publicity-wise, we 
could profit. We want to 
esrablish a good working 
relationship with the Chargers," 
Luginbill said, "but we support 
UCSO 100 percent if they (the 
Chargers) stay there," No official 
decision will be reached until . 
after the Super BowlOan. 26), 

Luginbill would not elaborate 
on what type of profits could be 
generated or how SDSU could 
benefit from having the Chargers

By JOHN SCHACHT and GUS SANTOYO 
UCSD punts on Chargers move? 

I F ONE THING HAS become clear since Alex Spanos took over the reins from Gene Klein, it is that Spanos is definitely the master in his own 
house, The second year owner has already put his 
personal stamp on the local team in many ways. 
Players. coaches and the front office have all felt the 
Single-minded drive of Spanos as he attempts to 
rescue the Ch~rgers from the depths of the AFC West. 

If one believes that Spanos is indeed in charge, 
then we can assume that the Chargers will not be 
returning this July to UCSD for their annual training 
cam p. Spanos left little doubt about the matter when 
he told Wire to Wire that he felt UCSD was too much 
like a "damn country club" and a place where his team 
could not get the diSCipline it needed. Spanos has 
suggested that a move to SDSU is imminent. 

Chancellor Richard Atkinson was quoted in the 
San Diego Union as saying that the Chargers "add a 
certain quality to the campus." But apparently those 
in charge of keeping the Chargers at UCSD don't feel 
that keeping the Chargers at UCSD is that great of a 
priority, How else does one explain the poor 
condition of Warren field, and the proposed changes 
in the players' dining quareters and hOUSing 
facilities? 

In short. it apPears th'at UCSO's athletic and 
financial braimrust have failed to capitalize on the 
possible benefits UCSD could have gamered from the 
Chargers' presence here on campus, The attitude 
inherent in the positions of the university and San 
Diego State shows the remarkable difference between 
the colleges. 

Van Jahnes-Smith , UCSD's business manager, 
summed up the relationship between the Chargers 
and UCSD when he told the Union that it's been 
"basically a 'what-it-costs-us-it-costs-you' thing with 
the Chargers. It 's been a break-even thing; it has 
never been a profit making venture ." AI Lunginbill 
told the Unron that hIS campus (SDSU) could profit 
from the presence of the Chargers and that the profits 
might go toward improVing State 's faCIlities Lugmbill 
faded to elaborate on how the profits might be 
genera ted . but it is dearthat the (SDSU) would love to 
have the Chargers training camp at thetr school. 

1 heIr Interest IS such that , according to DSU VIce 
PreSIdent BII! Em kson . a new polic)' I~ "being 
conSIdered to take our footh,11I team (the Aztec~) to 

another place .. . for their early practices. so (here 
would be no connict over space," Juxtaposed to 
UCSD's failure just to maintain the Warren field, the 
SDSU attitude is a good indication of where the 
Chal},trs will be this summer. 

UCSD officials have been negligent in their duties 
by not taking full advantage of the presence of the 
Chargers. So the next time someone complains about 
lack of funds , it might be a good idea to take a look at 
their attitude toward having an attraction like the 
Chargers on campus before joining them in their call 
for cutting coaches' salaries and curring back on 
sports to make ends meet. 

Are you high, or what? 
The NCAA recently passed a measure supporting 

drug testing for collegiate athletes which will go imo 
effect next Aug. 1. 

The testing will be done at football bowl games and 
NCAA championships and could also involve 
penalties for coaches covering up any drug scandals. 
CostS for the testing will reach approXimately 
$14,400 for each bowl game, and the NCAA will foot 
half the bill. For championship events, the NCAA will . 
also pay 50 percent of the cost of the drug testing, 
with the other 50 percent coming out of gross receipts 
before any colleges or conferences share in the 
orofits. 

The bulk of the measure is, of course, aimed at 
those schools in Division I who have experienced 
problems with drug abuse on their athletic teams. 
UCSD Athletic Director Judy Sweet poims out that 
there will be drug testing in Division [[ as well , 
although not until the '86- '87 spons year. "There are a 
number of things to be ironed out with the measure ," 
Sweet said , "and the actual plan itselfhas not yet been 
implemented so I am not quite sure how it will affect 
our university." 

The testing m bowl games will proceed m the 
following fashIon: thirty SIX players from each team 
will be tested , 22 who have played the most 
th roughout the course of th e season and 14 others 
who will be chosen randomly. The first major

Marshall 
-

Continued from page I ~ 
While at SDSU, where he 

majored in English literature, 
Marshall took the]V coaching 
position at Clairmont High 
School. From there he moved to 
varsity head coach at El Cajon 
High School. 

One of the reasons he was 
hired at El Cajon was because of 
his military experience. There 
was a disciplinary problem with 
the players on the team and they _ 
needed someone who could 
handle them. Marshall, who is 
very congenial and easy to talk 
to, can at times appear rather 
intimidating with his 6-foot-7-
inch frame. After his first game, 
the diSCipline problems surfaced; 
he recalls that he "kicked off all 
the seniors 'cause they thought 
they were king shit.'" 

While at El Cajon, Marshall 
realized that he had 
accomplished all the goals he 
had set for himself. It was time 
for some new goals: college 
basketball. 

When Marshall heard about 
the assistant coaching position at 
UCSD he jumped at the 
opportunity even though it was a 
considerable cut in pay. 

This is only his third year as 
head coach after twO years of 
assistant coaching. It is said by 
many people, including some of 
the members on the team, that 
Marshall is more of a "players' 
coach" than his predecssor was. 
Marshall plays this off as a 
difference in personalities. 

Marshall has a very vocal and 
open personality. He is well liked 
by his players and has an ·open 
door relationship" with them. 
They know he is always there 
when they need to discuss any 
problem, even if it does not 
concem basketball. 

He believes he is "dealing with 
class individuals in the players at 
UCSD." There are no real 
diSCipline problems at this level. 
He has only one rule fot his 
players: "If you do anything 
against this school, the team or 
yourself. I will handle it any way 
I see fit. " Even though this is a 
broad rule , he does not think it 
necessary to tell them when they 
can or cannot drink, study, go 
out or anything else. 

Not only does Marshall have a 
good relationship with his 
players. but he also has a g90d 
under!tagding with the officials. 
Being an ISA official himself 
does· not hurt; in fact , it gives 
him a great advantage. LaSt year 
alone he officiated over 500 
games. 

Knowing the third angle (the 
other angles being playing and 
coaching) gives him a "credibility 
factor" other coaches don't have. 
"Officials know I know what the 
hell I'm talking about out on the 
coun," said MarshaU. He even 
won a dinner bet on a disputed 
can with a referee. "I work games 
and go to bars with these guys. 
These officials play big roles in 
the outcome of the games. 

Marshall has new goals for his 
career now that he is at ·the 
college level, and they all inch.lde 
UCSD. He hopes that he will be ' 
with the Tritons to see them 
grow into a truly tine program. 
First he would like to see the 
team getling ir:uo a conference 
and then go Division One 
somewhere down the line, 

Basketball absorbs aU his free 
time; there is not much room for 
a serious social life: tryouts in 
the fall , season games in the 
winter. conditioning in the 
spring and officiating in the 
summer. But Marshall loves what 
he does; to him it is not work, it 
is hiS life. ~

Lacrosse men begin 
season Feb. I 
By AC SKIP ARMSON 

A HEATED EXCHANGE sparked the atmosphere during the first week of 
lacrosse practice at UCSD. 
Mauricio Sada had to restrain 
Mike Phillips who erupted at 
another player: "If you ever call 
me asshole again I'm going to kill 
you . .. • Teammates fighting can 
cause more problems than are 
usually resolved. A little 
constructive criticism can 

n;totivate people, however. 
PhiUips' personality brings a bit 
of the East Coast to this laid-
back Californian team, and if last 
week's practices are any 
indication, it could be a good 
thing. 

It could be a return to the 
olavoffs or another roller-coaster 
year for the lacrosse-men. 

Hi~hl~hting last season was the 
team's first victory over San 

The home of the 

Diego Slate. However, a 7-7 
record fell shon of expeclations 
and post-season play. 'We've gOl 
a solid team," commented head 
coach Kevin Pope, "All I need is 
15 guys who really want to play. 
Twenty would be nice." 

Ten men from each team 
compete on the field at a time: 
three attackmen, three 
mid fielders, three defensemen 
and a goalie. Ideally, a couple of 
reserves should be at attack and 
defense while fielding three 
midfields. Some teams only run 
two midfields, usually because 
their third line is weak. The 
Tritons shouldn't have that 
problem this year as an 
abundance of middies are 
capable of slaning. 

• 

For the first time last 
Wednesday, the team's goalie, 
Glen Fisher, showed up at 
practice. Fisher has c:her 
obligations to fulfil1, such as 
playing the bass in a jazz 
ensemble and working, so his. 
teammates rarely get to see him 
aside from game day. The 
LAXmen are glad to have Ted 
Maher retum from injuries that 
threatened his abilil)' to play 
lacrosse. As backup goalie, the 
change from playing midfield 
win be a tough one. A graduate 
from University High School in 
San Francisco, Maher win supply 
his teammates with a missing 
link: a goalie to shoot on and 
practice with. 

Eight home games in a row 

highliJtht a lOugh schedule 
including: UC Davis, UC Santa 
Barbara, Univ. Of Arizona, SDSU 
and UCLA The Tritons aren't 
likely to intimidate any of these 
teams. They don't have the size . 
However, coach Pope has 
stressed peer and self motivation 
and he's been getting it - even 
when he's not at practice. There 
is also renewed respect for Pope 
this year, who plans to retum to 
New York after this season to 
continue his education. Currently 
he receives about SI000 for 
coaching at UCSD. 

The Tritons open league play 
this Super Sunday at Occidental. 
The Tritons' home odyssey 
begins feb. 1 at 1 pm. ~

R.O.C. punks and other sinkers 
There once was an outing club memb~r who adventured 

to Baja California and realized that there is potentially a 
good lot of fun to be had in climbing, running and exploring. 
Upon returning to UCSD she noticed - this is not my mess 
kit, this is not my big house , this is .not my fleet of Rolls 
Royces - Hey how did I get here? Is the chaotic mental state 
of that member a product of her environment or is it her 
genes? Meeting, slide show, musical accompaniment 
Tuesday, 7 pm. Everybody welcome and warmly received 
but not cured. Rec. Conf. Rm #2.
