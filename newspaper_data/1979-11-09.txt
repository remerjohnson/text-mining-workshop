UC Hospital Seems Seismically Safe 
By Peter Mortensen 

The report card on 
University Hospital's seismic 
stress resistance is in and, 
according to Vice-Chancellor 
for Business and Finance 
Herm Johnson, "it is not an 
unfavorable report." 

And Dr. Richard Brune, 
associate director of Scripps 
Institute of Geophysics and 
Planetary Physics gave a 
sketchy idea Wednesday of 
what might be contained in the 
report to a meeting of the 
U ni versi ty Board 0 f 
Overseers. 

According to Brune, there is 
"no life safety problem" 
foreseen in the vicinity of 
University Hospital during the 
next 100 years. 

The Rose Canyon fault 
system surrounding University 
Hospital in the Hillcrest area

years , said Brune, noting that 
the only earthquake of any 
size to come from the system 
registered "only" 5.6 on the 
Richter Scale. 

Brune said present 
technology allows scientists to 
predict the probable damage 
from an earthquake to within 
10 km of its fault. Inside that 
10 km limit, though, Brune 
warns that damage prediction 

is a "big uncertainty." 
Aside from the optimistic 

comments of Johnson and 
others, university officials 
have chosen to remain silent 
about the content and details 
of the report. Copies of the 
study were received by Vice 
Chancellor Bernard Sisco 
today, Johnson said, but "it is 
not in the best form to discuss it 
now." Sisco was unavailable 

for comment. 
The study, which was 

submitted today to concerned 
parties at UCSD and the 
university system, will be 
reviewed by the Regents in 
~ecial meetings next 
Thursday and Friday. 

"It's a little premature to try 
to second-guess the interpreta-
tions made by the Regents.." 
said campus architect Chuck 

Powers, adding that it would 
be "much wiser to discUII the 
report's content" and effect. 
after the Regents have taken 
official action. 

The study, commiuioned 
by the Regents, was prepared 
by Seismic Engineering 
Associate., Ltd. in Lo. 
Angeles. It was not disdoaed 
how much money the research 
firm received for completing 
the report. 

UCSD School of Medicine 
officals have indicated that 
one of the motives for the 
report was the fact that the 
Regents are considering 
purchasing the Univer.ity 
Hospital from San Diego 
County. 

In addition, the study was 
instituted because, acx:ording 
to both Johnson and Brune, 
the hospital does not meet 
state and federal earthquake 
safety standards.

.---------Survey Shows----------, 
Faculty/Student Conta~t Decreases 

. By Bill Averill . 
The results of a UC faculty time use study 

released yesterday show a significant 
decrease in the amount of time that faculty 
members spend in direct contact with students 
compared with results from a similar study 
completed last year. 

'The study, conducted by the non-profit 
Institute for Research in Social Behavior and 
sponsored by UC systemwide administration, 
show. little difference from a similar .tudy last 
year, except thot the average weekly number 
of hour. faculty members spent in direct 
contact with students declined from 13.0 to 
11.8. 

Acx:ording to the study, make at the state's 
request, fuD-time regular faculty members 
spent "an average of over 61 hour. per week 
on Univer.ity·related activities," about the 
same •• Iaat year. 

This inchJde. 26.1 hours spent on 
instructional activities, such as regularly 
scheduled course instruction, non-credit 
instruction, supervision of independent study, 
student advisinR, course preparation a nd oral 

examinations. There is an additiona l 23.2 
houri on research and creative a<.tivities, 7.7 
hours on univeristy service activities, and 4.4 
hours on professional and public service 
activities, according to the study. 

Richard Scheffer, Systemwide Academic 
Planning and Program Review staff member, 
who served as Uaison to IRSB, lays he is 
"very happy" with the results of the study, 
which show that "faculty are working very, 
v hard." ~heffer "can't tell" if the decrease in direct 
faculty-.tuclent contact represents a trend 
because some variation is expected in the data 
from year to year. 

A similar study will be conducted by 
sy.temwide in winter and spri~g this year and 
the data obtained from it will tielp determine if 
such a trend exists, he says. 

Paul SaJtman, UCSD Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs, felt that the decline in the 
hours spent in direct contact with student is 
"not a major change." He added that if the 
total hours spent on teaching by the average 
faculty member decreast'd from "26 hours to 

/'/"(I\l' '"'" III II(/~l' 1 

thousand dollars, the officials 
swd . 

Though a spokesman at 
Wi ttm an" office said 
yesterday afternoon that he 
was still considering asking for 
a recount, they admitted that 
he currently has no money to 
pay for it. 

And the Associated Press 
reported yesterday that 
sources close to Wittman were 
discounting the possibility that 
the San Diego attorney, who is 
also 32, would ask for a 
recount. 

SUghtly more than 500 
absentee ballots have yet to be 
counted, according to the San 
Diego County Registrar's 
office, but they are not 
expected to alter the election's 
outcome. 

In a grisly display of their 
anti-American zeal, a student 
protester set himself afire 
outside the embassy 
yesterday, Iran's Pars news 
agency said. He was later 
reported near death in a 
Tehran hospital . 

The students, meanwhile, 
released what they said was 
embassy correspondence 
showing that US officials had 
planned last summer to allow 
Shah Mohammad Reza 
Pahlavi into the United States 
permanently. 

The rejection of the PLO 
mission seemed to kill one of 
the best hopes for ending the 
explosive situation quickly and 
peacefully.

Salesmanship is a 

IOphiJticated combination of 
showmanship, psycholC!BY 
and subtle manipulation. The 
salesperson is highly trained 
and motivated to make you 
want to buy. After all, 

. saIe.people earn their living 
from the commillion · they 
make on closing sales. 

, 

This is the first of two parts. 
Nina MacConnel wrote this 
story for CaIPIRG. 

A great deal of research has 
been done to determine what 
works in convincing different 
types of prospective buyers to 
buy. The methods are tried 
and tested. If they don't 
increase sales, they are 
discarded. 

The following sales 
techniques are compiled from 
Big League Sales Closing 
Techniques by Lea Dane and 
Effective Selling Through 
Psychology by Buzzotta, 
book. written by and for the 
sales ~rofe .. ion. The 
language Uled is theirs, not 
ours. 

The salesmen's first job is to 
evaluate you. They are taught 
that you are one of four basic 
types of buyers (professional, 
individual, family or female) 
and then by correctly 
categorizing you they can 
utilize the strategy of selling 
that works beat for you.

The typology perpetuates 
social and sexual stereotyping. 
Single women, referred to as 
"unattached females," are one 
group in whom author Lea 
Dane specializes. He writes 

that women are susceptible to 
every trick known to the sales 
Profession: "She is susceptible 
to flattery, can't resist beauty, 
is sympathetic and rarely 
forceful." 

He continues "the real 
beauty of selling the woman 
lies in one trait every woman 
has: she rarely knows what she 
needs or wants." 

The homespun psycholo-
gizing about "family men" is 
not much more flattering. The 
aame author recommends to 
be .ure to also sell to the family 
man'. wife and children 
because few "fellows" can 
resist their wives' and 
children'. happy persu8lion. 

Every ~lOnahty type " ..

"you -can't ·kid ·me .because -

"I'm .going - to ·go ·slow ·and .

·so ·you ·can't -take -

you are the "scardy ·cat ·can't 
·make -a ·decision" type, or 
one who tries to make up 
excuses, they have a 
technique for you. They will 
change their tactics-if you are a 
"shop arounder." A 
salesman'lI goal is to complete 
a sale on your first visit. Every 
time he has to follow up he 
loles a percentage of pollible 
sale •. Advice to the sale.man 
focUlel on one theme - how 
to close a sale. 

The saleaman needs to win 
your confidence. To do this he 
I. taught .how to "probe" you. 
The more he listens to you and 
know. about you, the better 
equipped he is to focUi his 
sales pitch on the feature of his 
product that match your 
.pecific concerns. A good 
salesman wants you to be 
happy because that can lead to 
future sales. 

U you are afraid of making a 
big purchase decision, the 
salesman i. told to try to 
identify with you or ~th a 
person that you tum to for 
advice. If he can establiah a 
trust he hal a platform to show 
you why he feels that his 
product will satisfy you. 

If you are a perlOn who is 
insistent about shopping 
around before making a 
deci.ion you are more of a . 
problem because he wants to 
be sure he doesn't lose a 

potential customer. Instead of 
trying to convince you that his 
product is the best, the 
salesman is advised to 
encourage you to shop 
around, and then report back 
what you find. Then he will 
show you why his product is 
the best buy available. He will 
rarely reveal the specifics 
before or he'd lose his 
persuasive hold. Remember 
that the best deal is not 
necellaruy synonymous with 
the lowest price; quality is an 
iml>Ortant consideration. 

To close a sale the salesman 
is told that he needs 
"indecision melters. " To help 
you make up your mind, he 
might advertise or make a 
"today only" deal. He might 
tell you the item is the last of a 
particular model or color or 
that it is the last day the item is 
available at a particular price. 
If you wait to make up your 
mind, hell say, you might lose 
your opportunity. 

The basis of the indecision 
melter is subtle or not so subtle 

persu~ion. A salesman is 
taught to always be positive, to 
constantly nod his head and 
say thing II like "don't you 
agree?" One book explains 
that salesmanship works like 
mass hypnosis, keeping you in 
a (JOsitive frame of mind. You 
will notice that a salesman wiD 
rarely ask you a yes or no 
question but rather will offer 
you choices. He will not say, 
"Do you want this car?" but 
rather, "Would you like to 
look at the specifications or 
should I draw up the papers?" . 
He will direct the conversation 
without trying to overcome 
each one of your objections, 
talking instead about each 
feature you are interested in. 
He might direct you right tot 
the close: "Well, it look. like 
we found the perfect model for 
you. Will this be ca.h or 
charge?" 

Tag teams and double 
teams are two other 
techniques taught to salesmen ' 
to persuade you to buy. !he 
"tag team" is a method of 
utilizing an outsider in a 
seemingly coincidental way to 
provide an outside confirma· 
tion that the buyer will be 
making the right choice. It 
might be a secretary or a 
waitress at the coffee Ihop 
where the salesman takes you 
who just happens to say how 
glad she is that he lold her the 
car he did. In a dress shop it is 
dallically another cUitomer 
who lpontaneously tells you

Zaire Massacre 

PARIS - The International Federation for the 
Rights of Man announced yesterday that it had 
confirmed reports that 215 persona were massacred 
last aummer by governmentlOldiers in Zaire. The 
Zairean Embauy Ilere denied the report. 

Daniel Mayer, president of the federation, which 
serves as an umbrella organization for about 20 
national human rights groups, said the information 
about a massacre in Zaire'a eastern Kasai Province 
last summer came from Zairean sources three days 
ago. It has since been verified, he said. 

Amnesty International, the London based human 
rights organization which won the 1977 Nobel Peace 
Prize, said it had received conflicting reports on the 
incident and did· not ha ve sufficient information to 
make any judgment. 

PLO Offer 
Continued from f>a~e 1 

The students said AyatoDah Ruhollah Khomeini, 
supreme leader of Iran's Islamic republic, and his 
secretive Revolutionary Council backed them in 
rebuffing the two·man PLO mediation team, Tehran 
radio reported in a broadcast monitored in Kuwait. 

They would not "o~n talks with anybody or 
accept any mediation,' the studenll said, until the 
United States met their main demand - sending the 
el(iled shah back to Iran for trial. 

Talks cannot deliver Iran "from the claws of the 
USA," they declared. 

Despite this latest blow to their efforts, diplomats 
around the worla continued to work feveri.h1y to try 
to defuae the explosive aituation. • 

Before the PLO mission was rebuffed, US officials 
reported that former Attorney General RamleY 
Clark, Preaic!ent Carter's special envoy, W81 meeting 
with a PLO representative in latanbul, Turkey, to try 
to speed up the mediation process.

Iran Cuts Oil 
NEW YORK - Iran is cutting fourth-quarter 

crude oil deliveries to major oil companies worldwide 
by 5 percent retroactive to Oct. 1, spokesmen for the 
companies confinned yesterday. 

Word of the aMouncement by the National 
Iranian Oil Co. came from British Petroleum Co., 

' Iran's largest customer, and from others including 
Exxon Corp., Ashland Oil Inc., Gulf Oil Corp., Shell 
Oil International and several large trading 
companies in Japan. 

It was not immediately known if the cut 
represented a drop in oil production or the diversion 
of oil from contract sales to the more lucrative spot 
market, where oil prices are more than 50 percent 

~ghe~ . 
"We were encouraged by the news," said Ashland 

spokesman Dan Lacey. "It seems to ' imply the 
Iranians intend to keep exports moving" after 
widespread reports suggested Iran may have halted 
oil shipments. 
. The Iranian government and national oil company 

have denied that exports ceased this week at the key 
Kharg Island oil port on the Penian Gulf, and US 
government and industry spokesmen have said 

s~pmenll are continuing. 

Brown Declares 
WASHINGTON - California Gov. Edmund G. 

Brown Jr. formally began his quest for Hie 
Democratic presidential nomination yesterday, 
declaring himself the only political leader capable of

"The sense ill pervasive that something i. wrong, 
that our nation i. divided when it should be decilive 
and acting with clear purpoae," Brown said in his 
announcement of candidacy. 

Iranians Protest 
LOS ANGELES - A lITIall group of ansrY 

Iranian students scuffled yelterday with other 
students at. the University of Southern California, but 
police said there were no injuries and no arrests. 

SouthWeit Diviaion police officer Steven Harer 
said Los Angeles police were called in to bobter 
campus security as more than 100 Iranian. gathered 
on the USC CampUi Commonl during the noon 
hour. 

USC has a total of 700 to 750 Iranian students in 
the total university student body of about 25,000, "a 
decline of about 300 Iranians since last spring," 
Peterson said. 

There were 110 new Iranian students this fall, he 
said. 

"Of them, o!!!>, one actually was from Iran," 
Peterson said. "The others came from schools in the 
states."

Salbnan aIao noted that the hours spent in 

peparation for a lecture do not enter into the 
category of direct student contact, and that 
long hours apent on preparation may result in Ii 
"6ntd ... lecture" even though spending time in this 
way rni8ftt "look lousy in the survey." 

The study was conduc:tecf through diaries of 797 
fuD·time regular faculty members &om all UC 
campu.ea over a 48 or 72 hoW' period. They were 
then uked to report their hours on a confidential 
questionnaire. 

The Daily Guardian 

Profs S~rvey Says 
According to ScheHer, the diary method is "far 
~ ac:c:urate" than a survey that uka for the 
average time apent on various activities. 

"I have a lot more faith in our study than in any 
other study I've seen." . 

The study does not break down results by campus. 
This wu "a basic ground rule of the study" 

according to Scheffer. 
In 8 letter sent to participating faculty members 

prior to the study, he says they were promised that 
the results "would not be used to compare 
individuals, departmenb, or campuses." This was 
done "to encOW'age frank reporting" of faculty 
members' hours.

(onl;nued from pall'" 2 

'the department has an attrition rate of 90 percent 
among ib graduate studenb, which is simply false. It 
also implies that this attrition rate is the result of a 
~ eHort on the part of the department to keep. 
OW' enrollment artificially high and even to protect 
OW'aeIves from competition for jobs from our students 
by refusing to award them degress. The latter charge 
is too ridiculous to comment upon. 

First for some facts. According to our own recorda, 
84 graduate studenb have enrolled in the department 
since the faD of 1970. 
This includes the approximatdy 30 studenb 
currendy in residence. Of thia total only two have so 
far ~<:eived their PhD.. nu., however, is not 
IlD'priq when one coruiders that the a~8@ Ie..... 01 time in this COW1try for earrmg a PhD 
decree in phiIoeophy is well over leven yean. Dwiag 
the same period only 10 students have been 
diImiued or "8unbd out," while 31 others have left 
volunWiy for. wide variety 01 reasons. Among the 
pnHIIIlfOUP of 1Iudenb, leV .. have been advanced 
to candidacy, and at lead line or four more are 
expected to be advanced by the end 01 the academic 
year. 

Mr. O'Connor aIao chara- that atudents can be 
dropped &010 the propam one week before the 
betinninfI of the and "are IUIIUIIIU'iy 
cIi8niIeeCI &om their 'r" .J:.. ... The first part 01 the 

~ i. technic:aIy correct but very mUIeadi ... As 
a rauIt 01 a revilion 01 our PhD reQUiremerU, which 

was requested by the students themselves, it is 
poaaible for students to be dismissed shortly before 
the beginning of the third year. This, however, never 
happens without considerable forewarning. We 
believe in being ~toroughly honest with our students 
and in.keeping them adequately informed with regard 
to their progress. The second part of the charge is 
simply false. No student in our department has ever 
been "stripped of their T Aship" summarily or 
otherwise. . 

Fmally, I would like to say a word about a serious 
issue that Mr. O'Connor does manage to raise 
perhaps inadvertantly. This il the difficulty besetting 
PhD. programs and graduate level education 
general~ in the humanities in the United States 
today. The lOW'ce of the difficulty is the rather bleak 
career prospects in academia for the Phd. It takes 
people of considerable dedication to devote six or 
levI!!' .rears of their lives to it discipline as demanding 
as phiJ~y, a discipline . which demands among 
other things competence In at lealt two foreign 
languages. nu. is particularly true when the chances 
of a aucceaalul career as a reward for one's efforts are 
10 dim. Given this, it is no wonder we have a high 
attrition rate_ To my mind the remarkable thing is 
that we have been able to attract a 1I11a11 but steady 
nmnber 01 students with the required intdlectual 
ability and dedication. As long as this continues, 
phiIoIophy will be alive and well at UCSD.

Freshmen Rate 
UC Campuses 
For Satisfaction 

By Jeff Beresford 
New. Editor 

At what school in the UC system are freshmen beat 
adjusted? 

Davis, with its centralized student community? 
Santa Cruz, with itl Monterey Say location? 

The answer, according to a random survey of 
ltudenb on each of the syatem'l eight undergraduate 
ca!!,puses, is the smoggy, isolated Riverside campus. 

That il the impression left by a year.and-a-half 
long study measuring whether student aervices and 
programs leave freshmen satisfied with their first year 
in the system. 

Most students, the study shows , like their school. 
Campuses averaged about 90 percent "generally 
satisfied" responses , but Riverside was easily the best 
liked <94%), and UCSD and Berkeley finished last 
<at 85%), dominating the bottom of most evaluation 
lists. 

Most campuses are presently gen rating their own 
survey reports (UCSD's is scheduled for release next 
week), but the Davis analysis is completed, with 
figures on each campus. 

UCSD, for example, is last in the system in 
"friendliness of student," "entertainment presented 
on campus," "campus social activities" (by over 
eight percent) , and "interaction with faculty ," 
according to its own respondents. 

UCSD was also near the bottom in ethnic cultural 
programs, availability of places to study, and quality 
of classroom instruction. 

Riverside, thoullh, was 6rst in library facilities, 
study availabilit~, living arrangemenb and average 
claassize, as well al an aggregate category, "general 
UC experience." . 

The study does not, survey official. stress, 
measure. quality, but rather freshman perception of 
campus life and facilities. 

Since the study me&a"!fel satisfaction with 
services, Riverside's underpopulated campua is given 
by one study analyst as the reason for ill ~. 

"Of course Riverside students are happier. 1nere 
isn't anybody there, so they can use all their facilities,

Some AcljuBtment Problems 
Volleyball Women Savor Winning Ways 
By Jan Goetz 
Sparta Editor 

In 1!J78 the women's 
volleyball team had the kind of 
IeUon that doesn't impnn 
many people. They Ioet dlO 

games at the All.CaI, only 
beat two of the five junior 
colleges they played, and 
finished the aeuon with leven 
wjna apinat 131oaaea. 

Prospects for 1979 didn't 

look mUch better for the team. 
Grace Greenberg .quit aa 
coach during the offseason, 
and the new coach, Dough 
Dannevik, waan't officially 
hired until a few days before 
practice started. 

Something happened in the 
lut two montha; however, aa 
new confidence has settled 
over the athletes. 'They have 
rolled up an 11·3 record 10 far. 
They are leeded nwnber one 
in the Wesbnont Tournament 
this weekend, and they wiU 
probably qualify for the 
AlA W regional finals in 
Sacramento later thi. month. 

Dannevik is even talking 
about a national champion. 
ship in two or three years. 

'The new IUccess began at 
the opening of the season in 
September when the coach 
and athletes decided that the,. 
were going to play to win thia 
year, inatead of h1st to have a 
good time. Exhausting 
workouts eventually cut the 
team roster down to eight, but 
each team member has 
accepted her team responsibi. 
tity and refined it in the past 
eight weeks. 

"(Last year) a lot of people 
were just plafog to have a 
good time ... There are a lot 
more people willing to work a 
lot . harder this year, Cheryl 
Wn,ht said. 

Yelling at the players during 
practice baa had ita negative 
effects 8Ometimes, but seems 

. to help correct mistakes. 
corm Iow-lrey at times, but 

I'm excitable. I don't think 

they're used to that," 
Dannevik &aid. ''They began 
crawling into a aheII when I 
criticized them. I had a couple 
of girls cry because they 
thought I was being too hard 
on them." 

He had to hold some team 
meetings to explain his 
philosophy - that he only 
yells to avoid having mistakes 
happen again. Yet the athletes 
weren't used to that under their 

. past coaches, who were 
generally approaching the 
season less intent on whipping 
the women into shape. 

After a while, they began to 
adapt to Dannevik's 
perfectionist but enthusiastic 
style. Hi. Zeal began to rub off 
on the reat of the team. 

"Because Dough ia very 
enthusiastic, everyone else is 
too," .aid Wright. 

''We're more cOl1npe,titil~e 

because we've been winning," 
said Beth Prather, a hitter for 
the team. "Once you start 
winning, you want to win it 
aU." 

A blend of increaaed 
confidence, refined skilla, and 
better communication has 
fueled the fire of enthusiasm. 

"They now have a winning 
attitude," aaya Dannevik. 

. When they lost to Azusa 
Pacific in three straight games 
Tuesday, the team was upaet. 

Azusa is the probable 
favorite to win the AlA W 
national championship this 
year, yet team members 
honestly believed that they 
could have beaten them, under 
the right conditions. . 

"1hat's the attitude I've 
tried to develop -feistiness, 
hustle," said Dannevik.

Student Places 3rd 
In 'Mr. San ·Diego' 

By Barbara Haas 
Staff Writer 

Imagine being forced to eat nothing but tuna and water for two 
weeks. Now imagine adopting such a diet involuntarily. Warren 
freshman Greg Isaacs not only can imagine it, but he does it 
regularly. 

Isaacs is a body builder. In fa.ct he placed third in last 
Sunday's Mr. San Diego contest. 

Isaacs, originally from Johannesburg, South Africa, has been 
body building for only three years. His first exposure to the sport 
was at a 1972 Mr. Olvrnoia comoetition in South Africa. There 
he met several wdl·known performers, including well-known 
body·builder Arnold Schwarzeneger, star of the movie-
documentary Pumping Iron. When he was 15 years old he 
started training for competition. 

The Mr. San Diego contest waa the first intercollegiate 
competition he entered . His third-place standing was especially 
successful, since he competed iliainst older and more 
experienced men. 

Body building competitions differ markedly from women's 
beauty pageants. Men cover their shaved bodies with oil that 
makes their bodies glisten under stage lights. The competitors 
flex their muscles for the judges, being scored on the symmetry 
and definition of muscle structure. 

A major preparation for any competition is the task of dieting. 
Isaacs severe diets of tuna and water for the two weeks 
preceding a contest are designed to caused striation to fonn in 
the muscle. 

"What we call it is getting cut, or getting ripped. You try to get 
rid of all the body fat in order to make the muscles stand out .. so 
there's no fat on the body," said Isaacs. 

His English accent is still prominent after two years in the 
United States. He first carne to the US to be with his father in 
Connectitcut, then carne to California to attend UCSD. 

Isaacs felt that he was finally up to the standard of competition 
in Connecticut and entered his first contest in 1977, a scholastic 
event in which he· placed fiftn. Later he continued to enter 
contes .. and subsequently won some and placed in the others. 
"'The contest cos .. $6 iust to enter. If you win, aU you get i. a 
trophy. PIus there are the vitamin supplements - which I would 
talce anyway· and the cost of joining a gym. This adds up." 

Enjoyment of the spOrt is the main reason Isaacs continues to 
devote 10 much time and money to body building. He enjoys his 
workou .. which consist of six times a week for one a half hours of

Last year, Raw Meat II emerged to carryon 
the tradition of the two previous seasons. One

capturing a place for themselves in the 

cham~onship game with heralded Chocolate 
City. The game went into overtime. Though it 
was close, the tradition held firm once again as 
Raw Meat II brought home their second AAA 
title. 

This year they returned once again as 
Unbeat Meat. They started the year by beating 
Scripps Seamen 19·6 and Rocky Mountain 
Oysters 12-6. "We must've scored ten 
touchdowns in those first games." said Meat's 
Quarterback Bob Mulick. "Five of them were 
called back on penalties." 

In their third game they began to get the feel 
of playing· together as they bested Los

"It's amazing," said Mulick, "Dave always 
manages to get open. I don't know how he doe. 
it, but every time I look for him, he's aU by

Meat's offense is rounded out with Mark 
Lochtefeld who doubles as a running back and

premieres of plays by Edward 
Albee, Harold Pinter and 
Samuel Beckett on and off

direction won him the rare 
honor of being the only 
director ever to win an Obie

Imagination on Stage: 'Man of La Mancha' 
By Beth Accomando 
Senior Staff Writ .. 

In writing Don Quixote. Miguel de 
Cervantes' intended purpose was to 
ridicule the trivial romantic novel. of 
hi. time through the madne .. of hi. title 
character. A. the novel progressed. 
however. Don Quixote'. enchanting 
idealism grew ;0 infectiou. ' that not 
even Cervantes was immune. So, what 
began a. a satirical attack on outdated 
chivalric value. became an 
aHectionate, humorous and poignant 
protrayal 01 the conflict between 
idealism and realism. Don Quixote 
became a reflection of Cervantes 
himseH. Sensing this affinity between 
hero and author, Dale Wauerman 
with Mitch Leigh and Joe Darion 
created Man 01 lA Mancha, a 
• tunning mu.ical that allow. 
Cervantes' identity to merge with that 
01 his creation, Don Quixote. This 

daaaic musical ill now being given a 
spirited, expert production by 
Southwestern CoDege. 

Man 01 La Mancha is set in a 
Spanish prison where Cervantes, 
awaiting a trial by the Inquisition, 
undergoes a mock trial at the hands of 
his fellow prisoners. In or~er to ransom 
his uncompleted manuscript from the 
prisoner/judges, Cervantes, offe~s. as 
his deferue, a performance In which he 
enaclll the role of Don Quixote. 

Directed by William Virchis, the 
Southwestern production superbly 
captures the atmosphere of illusion. 
The onstage tra,nsformation 
,(Cervantes donning makeup to 
become Don Quixote; changing an 
empty space into a confessional) are 
captivatingly handled and draw the 
audience into the magical realm of 
Cervantes' imagination. Virchie 
smoothly and energetically 

orchestrates the action whether it 's a 
complicated fight scene between Don 
Quixote and the muleteers or a simple 
staging of the number " I'm Only 
Thinking of Him." 

The role of Cervantes/Don Quixote 
is an extremely difficult one since it 
must embody imagination but Dave 
Caylor meelJ these demands with a 
fine performance. As Don Quixote's 
companion Sancho Panza, Gregorio 
Ruiz Flores Jr. turns in a strong, funny 
performance. Flores, though, could use 
lome fattening up, because tbe 
physical difference between Sancho 
and Don Quixote symbolizes their 
difficult approaches to life: the idealist 
VI. the realist. Sandra Sorah as 
Dulcinea/ A1donza seems a bit artificial 
at first but she soon overcomes this and 
delivers a moving characterization . 

Standouts among the well-cast 
supporting players are Robby Stewart 

in a delightful portrayal of the 
housekeeperl' David Alberto llivilU[ a forc~ful per ormance as Pedro, the 
leader of the muleteers; Daniel feraldo 
turning in an affecting portrait of the 
Padre; and John R. Padilla in an 
effective characterization of Duke and 
Dr. Carrasco. 

. The impresllive scenic design by 
Linnea Cook and the costumes by 
Tara A. Johnson are additional assets 
to this production. The acoustics in this 
theatre are a bit inadequate so that the 

(orchestra is sometimes too stron1{. 
The beauty of Man of La Mancha is 

that by the end of the play the infectious 
spirit of Don Quixote has enchanted 
not only the play's characters but also 
the audience. The Southwestern 
production captures this beauty. Man 
01 La Mancha will run November 8 ,9 
and 10 at Southwestern College's 
Mayan Hall , 990 Otay Lakes Road. 

Mandeville Art Speaks for Itself 
By Melanie NeillOll 

Claire Meyer covered her tracks 
admirablr. She went into the 
Mandeville Annex Gallery (Room 
BU8, Mandeville Center 
downstairs,) put up 18 pieces of her 
work and left without a word. Not a 
word. The 10 paintingl and eight 
color xerox copies have no titles and 
they need them. She leaves the 
viewer no information besides the 
works themselvel about her 
technique, materials or ideu. 

A written "statement" by the 
artist can UlUally be very valuable 
especially in a student gallery luch 

Peggu Seeger 

81 this where the emphasis should be 
on the sharing of ideas and the 
exchange of information .. as 
profeasional as pOlllible. The 
absence of such a statemeot in 
Meyer's case, whether out of 
indifference (highly unlikely) or out 
of her desire to let the pieces "speak 
for themselves" ia the major 
weakness of this show. But Claire 
makes up for it. 

The paintings are spray-painted 
through stencils onto sheet. of 
Vi.queen plastic sheeting, . a 
material used in industrial 
foundations and as a moisture 
barrier beneath concrete. Each 

piece is made up of painted layers of 
plastic ~th stenciled numbers, 
letters and various animals she 
might have taken from a child's 
pajamas or nursery curtains. At 
their worst, these pieces are rather 
drab and boring; at their best they 
become as dreamy and unexpected 
as the two near the entrance. One 
with a gun is "Oswald's Dream" to 
me. 

The two largest xerox pieces are 
the best. In one a nude woman (the 
artist) is seated in a radiation-
charged landscape beneath a crowd 
C?f iodine-pink clouds. I 5ke the 
tension and colors in this one. (I 

Validaled pot\<'ng 
in the La Jolla 

F,nancial Building 

would call it "Portrait of the Artist 
As A Young Punk".) A series of 
these would provide an interesting 
opportunity to explore the self· 
portrait and artist-in-wonderland 
ideas already found in much of her 
work. 

Meyer says she has been 
influenced by painting classes she 
has had with Pat Patterson and Kim 
McConnell. McConnell in particular 
"reinforced" her decorative 
impulses which can be leen in the 
patterns and wallpaper effeclJ in her 
paintings. 

In any case, I think that her work 
is worth a gawk.

MacColI was born into a working.dass family in 
Lancashire. He first became known in Britain for his 
involvement with experimental theater. He wrote a 
number of plays which have been translated into 
several languages before his interest turned to folk 
music. . 

A member of the musical family which indudes 
her brother, Pete, Peggy Seeger has had extensive 
training in both classical and folk music. She met 
MacColI in London in 1956 and the two teamed up 
and began performing and writing songs in the folk 
idiom, Among their better·known songs are "The 
First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" and "Gonna Be 
An Engineer." 

Seeger and MacColI now are married and have 
collaborated on a number of books, films and 
television and radio documentaries. They are 
recognized in Britain and the United States as two of 
today's most important perfQrmers and collectors of 
folk music.

Shady Salesmen E~posed 
C()n tinueel from f>a~e 2 
ho w giea I you look in the dress 
you are trying on. Some 
salesmen carefully sellhis Iype 
of interaction up. Others know 
how it elicit it. 

Double teaming is a well 
rehearsed two· man approach 
to selhng, based on the theory 
that two can break down your 
resistance fasler than on~ . It is 
a technique to get around 
personality clashes, stale· 
mates and indecision. The 
second might be just a friend, 
or a senior salesperson with 
mo re authority. He is 
frequently used to cinch a sale 
by telling an appropriately 
timed and aimed story, usually 
ab out someone with 
ci rcumstances amazingly 
similar to your own with the 
result that their purchase 
decision brought them good 
luck or their failure to make a 
decision brought them bad 
luck. 

One example was given of a 
senior lady hedging on buying 
a new car to replace her 
adequate but older model. 
Since she was not interested in 
style, power or status, the 
second was solicited and cued 

to focus on safety and security . 
Feigning no knowledge of her 
situation, he just happed to 
relate a newspaper story of 
how an old man's car broke 
down and he was beated and 
robbed. "What is this world 
coming to?" She said, and 
then bought the new car. 
These stories are always told 
as if they are incidental and are 

not meant to be moralistic 
parables to convince you to 
buy. 

A seasoned salesman is an 
ac~or. He knows all of your 
"a~bis" for not buying and 
ways to break them down. Be 
as prepared 'as he is before you 
make a purchase. Know what 
you want, need and can 
afford. Be sure you get it. 

Quiz Show 
Continued from page 9 
thoughout. As the play 
progresses, one gets the 
feeling that the subject of 
Phillips' play is not so much 
the corruption in 50's quiz 
shows as Marion's obsession 
with facts, to the exclusion of 
anything else. During his 
interviews with a brain 
specialist (Jade Wu), Marion 
is unable to see the value 
inherent in universal laws, and 
reacts to suggestions in this 
vein by spewing facts , an act 
born of tremendous insecuritv_ 

The fabulous set of Quiz 
Show Scandal is an integral 
part of its meaning, especially 
during the studio scenes, 

where the flashy chrome and 
corresponding phoniness of 
the announcer make a 
mockery of Marion's honest, 
useless knowledge. 

The play, as Phillips 
concedes, is a difficult one to 
do. There are twelve entirely 
separate scenes , each 
essential to the plot, and 
Schneider directs the play at a 
pace which leaves no room for 
pauses or stumbling_ Though 
the play is entirely unresolved 
and unsatisfying, ~nd th~ 
characters diffuse and unreal, 
the UCSD Drama Department 
should be commended for 
creating this difficult new play .

Continued from page 12 

Holiday dances from all over the world will be 
performed by Aman, the International Folk Dance 
Ensemble, in a holiday dance festival Friday, Nov. 
16, at UCSD. 

The profellional dance ensemble wiUperform at 8 
pm in the Mandeville Auditorium. Tickets cos 
$6.50 for general admission; $5.50 for students an 
UCSD staff and faculty, and $4 for UCSD student 

Since Aman was formed at UCLA in 1964, tI,t' 
troupe has grown into a professional company of 45 
singers, dancers and musicians. Members have 
travelled extensively to research the music and dance 
of a variety of cultu[es, and many mem~rs have 
become experts on folklore and ethnic arts. 

Most of the troupe's costumes are purchased from 
village craftsmen in the countries where each dance 
originated. Musical accompaniment is provided on 
authentic folk instruments ranging in size from the 
small Serbian fipple·f1utes to the Roman cymbalom. 

In a typical performance, the troupe will use more 
than 300 different costumes and up to 75 
instruments from its impressive collection. 

Among the dances which the troupe will perform in 
its UCSD appearance are the Moscow quadrilles, the 
Egyptian Mouled el NOUl, a traditional Appalachian 
barn dance, a wedding dance from Tunisia and a 
festive dance to an all-string Yugoslavian tamburica 
orchestra. 

The event is sponsored by the University Events 
Office. Tickets can be purchases at the UCSD 
Central Box Of~ce.

had been treated to headlines like these: 

"Killer Moths Savage Sheep Ranch?' 
"See it All! Intimate Sketches of Reckless 
Abandon in Dodge City!' 

"Psychic with Custer's Army Predicts Fame 
for All at Little Big Horn!" 

Reputations woul~ live and die on the front 
page every week: 

"I Kissed a Man with Wooden Teeth."-
Martha Washington 

"General Sherman: Pyromaniac or Poor Sport?" 
"Sitting Bull says, 'No More Mr. Nice Guy'." 

What's so bad about 
splinters? 

I see you wearing an 
arrow shirt. 

"500 Conestoga Wagons Recalled by Factory." 
"The Shocking Story of why They Call 
Roy Bean the Hanging Judge." . . 

With reporting like that, there might 
have been no gold rush. No home, 
steader . No civilization west of the 
Rockies. No Coors Beer. After all, it 
t k a lot of dedication for Ad lph 
Coors to locate up in the Colorado 
high country just to build the future of 
his product on pure spring water and 
mountain'grown barley. Or, as one of 
those paper might have put it: 

"Man Climbs 5,000 Feet for a Beer:' 

1astethe 
High Country.
