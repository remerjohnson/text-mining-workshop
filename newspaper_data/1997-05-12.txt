COMMENTARY: Attending classes at UCSD i no problem, the real adventure comes in trying 
to find a place to live each year, and it can lead some students to some very desperate measures 

THE GREAT HOUSING GODS MUST HATE ME 
By Mepn KleIn 
Associate Opinion Editor 

Spring quarter has rolled around 
again. With it comes spring lever, an 
intense desi re to skip class in favor of 
the beach and more winter-white legs 
emerging from shons than the eye 
can bear to sec. Soon summer wi II 
begin and I will be free from the con-
lines of school. Ah yes, the beach, the 
sand, the surf. Everything is calling 
me to look toward the wonders of 
summer. Yet, the prospect has been 
clouded because of a simple ques-
tion: "Where the heck am I goi ng to 
live neKt year?!" 

This question actually arose quite 
a whi le before the sun wanned the 
cllilly waters of La Jolla Shores. It 
was brought up initially in the dead 
of winter, only a lew months after my 
roommates and ) had moved into this 
year 's apartment. By February we 
were already talking about where we 
were going to live next year. Our dis-
cussion wi ll probably continue unt il 
this September on the move-in day of 
our neKt apartment Only then will . 
we feel secure enough to relax until 
the housing cycle begins again. 
Around and around - the housing 
wheel just doesn't stop spinning. 

My very first eKpcricnce wi th 
housing was during my senior year in 
high school, when I got to look at the 

colorful housing brochure produced 
hy UCSD Housing and Dining. I 
picked out where I wanted to live 
rrom the anru lIy designed fl oor 
plans. That year was the easiest, 
housing-wise at least) filled out that 
cute lillie roommate questionnaire, 
and t hey wrote me back a few 
months later telling me where I was 
going to live. 

First year of my housi ng adven-
ture: easy as pie - "A+" 

At the end of our rreshman year, 
my seven suitemates and I d~ided to 
split into two groups or rour and live 
in the Warren Apartments. This was 
our first adventure in actually gelling 
to decide where we wanted to live. 
All we had to do was divide our-
selves up and pick out an apanmenl. 
Our parents could worry about the 
lease, the payments and all those 
other I i It Ie dctai Is. 

We were only concemed with 
making our housing appointment on 
time so that we wouldn't get an 
apartment on the first floor, rumored 
to be infcsted with rat and ants. 
(Instead we lived in an apartment on 
the founh noor that had to be fumi-
gated for cockroaches fou r weeks 
into the quarter.) 1l1e hardest pan that 
year was trying to satisfy everyone 
with a roommate they wouldn't mur-
der before week two (Hey, free "A"s 

for all!). 
Second year of my housing 

adventure: s lightly more responsibi 1-
ity, but still very lilt Ie pressure - all 
in all , a solid "8." 

This year the housing cycle 
retumed again to haunt us. We stan-
ed discussing our option for nCKt 
year. Some of us still wanted to live 
together, some were pla nning to live 
with others and some had additional 
friends that wanted to live with us. 
Our group ranged between as few as 
Ii ve people to as many as 10 living in 
some son of combination some-
where we did not know. 

A rew of us began looking in the 
c1assilieds for prospective apart-
ments, whilc uthers protested it was 
too early to begin our seareh. We had 
a lew unprofitable housing meetings. 
Before long we found ourselves at 
the end or winter quaner with no 
prospective apartment in sight 

We fi nally decided to get the ball 
ro ll ing and at least d~ide who was 
going to li ve wi th whom. Ha! Not an 
easy task in the least, considering my 
group. We spent an hour discussing 
what everyone's options were and 
came to a tentative conclusion. 

When I fi nally thought we had it 
scnled, I heard a rumor that one girl 
was not living with us and another

CHARTER SCHOOL WILL BOOST UCSD's IMAGE 
Editor: 

I am writing 10 eK prcss my ·trong 
~uppon for th e CSD Charter 
Srhool. As a scholar of Ameril'an 
society and its ideals. I see our pre-
~e nt hi storica l ~i lll a t ion as one 
marked hy in,n:a~ingly antagonistic 
division ' of race and class and a lo~s 
of the American failh in education 
and eq ual opportunity as the way to 
Ol ercollle thc~c di vision,. The fat e 
or the uni versity. eSflCl:ially our pub-
lic universilY. is bound up wi th the 
fate of our society and its faith in 
cducation a~ a rmth of indusion in 
the Amcrican drcam. 

In the long run. the credibi lity 
and rC[Jutation or the ni crsi ty of 
Califomia requires that wc are ~cen 

a~ a great inslitution, ahlc and \.I ill-
i ng to take on thc great challcngt: of 
opening up r:q ual educational oppor-
tunily, and our own ul1lver,ity. to the 
I: hildren or har~h, di~crill1il1alOry and 
inequituhl c disadvantage and 
neglect 

Our L:Olleague~ ;.rt UCSD have 
rabed some reasonahle concerns 
ahoutthe cost, vlabilily and ~uc:c:e\, 
of a r: harter high ~c.:hoo l at the uni -
va\ily. In many w'pect, . the 
\choo l i like an eKpcriment in sci-
cnce. Even though it is we ll -
designed. judiciou~ly Ihought out 
and carefu lly w ntrolled, thc out -
come is somewhat unc:enain. Yet 
withou t experimcntation wi th its 
unr:enainty. sc ience is dead. 
Similarly, unless great institutions 
like UCSD arc ab le and wi lling to 
undertake well-conc.:eived ex peri-
ments like the charter school, the 
ideals and aspirations underl yi ng 
education in America will die, and 
with them, public suppon for the 
uni versity as well. 

When the chaner high school is 
up and run ning, visibly and success-
fully for all to sec, no one at the uni -
versity will feci anything but enor-

mous pride in UCSD and the chil-
dren or the chaner school wc helped 
to create. The presence on our cam-
pus of this sehoul of opponun ity and 
ho pe will show that the university is 
part of the so lution to the hiller con-
ilicts and despairs of our age, and 
not [Ja rt of the [Jroblem. Through the 
chaner school, we will have played 

~ome modest hut rcal ro le in sctllng 
our society and univer~i t y on a path 
or idealism and rcncwal.

Dynes Should 
Recognize the ASE 
Editor: 

Why doe, Chancellor Dyne, 
rcfusc to recognize the Assoc: iallon 
or Studcnt Employees (A E)'.' All 
employees in the country, im:luding 

tho~e in Califomia, have the right to 
choose representatives for thc pur-
flO,e of eolleL:l i ve hargaining over 
worf.. -rc latcd is,ue~ . In addition , 
over two-thirds of Ihe sludent 
cmployecs at UCSD have ~iglled 
cards sayi ng they want the ASE to 
represent I hem. Why, then . dne\ 
Chanc:cl lor Dynes rcfu~c to rel:og· 
nile the A E as the rcpresclllalive of 
student em[Jloyccs? 

Perhaps it is Oec:ause he thinks 
that TA~. readers, tutors and instruc-
tors arc not entitled to the rights of 
employees because they don't lit the 
legal delinition of "employcc" as 
stated in the California Higher 
Education Employer-Employee 
Relations Act (HEERA). 

However, HEERA states that stu-
dent employees are to be con 'iderctl 
employees if the work they do is 
either unrelated to, or ubordinatc to, 
thei r educational objectives. It is 
clear that this is the case for TAs,

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Monday, May 12,1997 

COMMENTARY: There are plenty of on-campus issues that the new Associated Students council can address next 
year, such as expanding and improving the co-ops, hosting more on-campus events and expanding other services 

NEW A.S. COUNCIL SHOULD HAVE LOCAL Focus 
By J ••• yc. w.n.c. 
Staff Writer 

The Wednesday hefore last 
marked the beginning of a new era 
at UCSD. New and old members 
of the Assoc iated Students of 
UCSD council (AS CSD or A.S .) 
met jointly, beginning a new year 
of studenl -orga nil.ation alloca-
tions, TGlrs and campaigns for 
students' righl s. A, Ihe new ly 
elected ufficials take over the 
third floor of the Price Cent er. It is 
time, to ~"k uur,elve, what we, 
the Mudents of UCSD, ex pec t 
from our A.S. Council and its 
memhers. 

More ' [lec ifically, and perha[ls 
more relevantly, should the A.S. 
council focus on UCSD-specific 
issues. effecting change Illl:ally, or 
should it dutifully address 
statewide issues, trying to make 
UCSD a beller place on a broader 
level '! 

Noting tbe current s tate of 
UCSD and the fact that the last 
A.S. council was devoted to 
statewide issues. the direction that 
the 1997-911 council should take is 
painfully clear. The A.S. t:Oum:il 
must focus on making UCSD a 
superior environment for socializ-
ing. learning and living by 
reworking our policies. our ser-
vices and our entertainmenl. 

Why is it so important for the 
A.S. council 10 concentrate on 
what is happening here'! The A.S. 
is the strongest student voice on 

campus. [I' change is to occur at 
UCSD, it must originate from the 
student body - led by the A.S. 
and other st udent groups. 

Moreover, if Ihe A.S. wants to 
increase a warene!)s and involve-
ment in i,sues that affect students, 
fQ(;u,i ng on statewide issues that 
do not impact them directly wi ll 
not heir . By concentrating it, 
effort, on concerns that student s 
can sink the ir teeth into, the A.S. 

promot e~ it~ own Image, a, well 
as thc in vo lvc ment of the gem:ral 
, tudenl body. 

As an example of how A.S. 
al:tions ca n affect the quality of 
life at U SD. consider the recent -
ly introd uced Student Life 
Survey. The uni ver,ity as a whole 
has taken a great leap toward the 
improvement of UCSD fl a m 
within by implementing the sur-
vey. 

Although the A.S. has conduct-
ed si milar surveys in the past, 
they have been far less expansive 
(and expensive) and distributed at 
inopportune times when student 
turnout didn ' t provide an accurate 
representation of the student 
body. The A.S. will learn a lot 
from this survey. Hopefully, the 
new council will allack the stu -
dent feedback head-on and pro-
vide as much change as possible. 

To say that the A.S. should 
focus more on UCSD isn ' t to den-
igrate tbe 1996-97 A.S. council. 
The erforts of this year's council 

By concentrating its 
efforts on concerns 
that students can 
sink their teeth 
into, the A.S. 
promotes its own 
image, as well as 
the involvement of 
the general student 
body. 
are laudable . Students eou Id re st 
assured this year that they would 
receive advanced warning of A.S. 
programming events with the 
appearance of the sandwich 
boards all over campus. It was 
also wonderful to see the council 
get behind the charter-high-school 
proposa l. 

Also laudable were the efforts 
of the Operations and Services 
oflil:e with regard to 

Undergraduate Scholasti c Grants 
(U .S. Grants). the Associated 
Students Internship Office 
(ASIO) and the Volunteer 
Connection . The student advocate 
a Iso carried a more than adequate 
caseload. 

These improvements refl ect a 
non-idle counci l, and arc much 
appreciated by the benefi ciaries. 
Praise is al so due when l:Onsider-
ing that the council managed not 
to drastica ll y upset anyo ne thi s 
year - definitely a ~ign of hard 
work. 

The new A.S. council should 
try to maintain the leve l of 
ac hi evement shown by the 1996-
97 counci I. It should ex pand ils 
e fforts to work with other student 
se rvices. such as Career Services 
and Student Health. A.S. could 
also hold the Registrar 's Offi ce 
and Student Financial Services 
accountable for their actions, as 
the staff in these offices are noto-
rious for not fully responding to 
students' needs. 

Moreover, A.S. could work 
with certain offices on campus to 
find a way to remain open until at 
least 5 p.m. and during the lunch 
hour. 

The council should also back 
expansion and improvement of 
the co-ops. This would be attract 
students to the Old Student Center 
for more than juS! coffee and [ec-
ture notes. 

A.S. could improve UCSD 

campus life by funding and host-
ing even ts like Pizza Night at 
Round Table, cheap barbecues in 
the Price Center at lunch tillle, all-
campus dances and theme nights. 
This year 's council could push for 
ex pansion of shUlll<! services, an 
area in which A.S. has traditional -
ly had much success. 

A.S. mu st work on stude nt -
safety issues invo lving parking 
lots, ni ghllime ca mpus activity 
and crime prevention. A.S. could 
poss ibly work toward repea ling 
the Dry Campus Act. The coun-
cil 's communicati on office should 
strengthen alternati ve media by 
requiring more frequent publica-
ti on to continue funding. 

The A.S. council has a wealth 
of resources. unmatched by any 
othe r student o rganization on 
campus. While it has powe rful 
tools to aCl:ompli sh its agenda, the 
A.S . should keep in mind that 
building coalitions with other stu-
dent groups makes it that much 
more effective. 

A sense of rivalry is healthy for 
the students involved, and opposi -
tion makes it easier to keep A.S. 
publicly accountable . However, 
the Guardian, a truth-seeking 
organization, should be able 10 
form an alliance with the A.S . 
council and still report back to the 
students when the council isn ' t 
d9ing its job.

TA STRIKE OPPOSED BY SOME COUNCIL: A.S, has room for 
improvement 

gramming, academil: and cultur-
al event s would show student s 
exactly what the counci l is or 
isn't accomplishing. Editor: While [ commend Eric Brace's 

lead story on the TA strike and the 
Guardian'S usual high standard of 
journalism ("'fA trike Set to Begin 
Wednesday," Guardian, May 5. 
1997). please take note that many, i r 
not most, graduate students do not 
support the TAs' actions. The very 
notion of striking again tthe univer-
sity is contrary to my view of the stu-
dent-te.1cher rel ationship. 

I came to UCSD after serving as 
an Air Force officer for five years, 
which gave me a pcrspel:tive that 
some of my fellow graduate students 
seem to lack. In contrast to the mili-
tary, the graduate education environ-
ment at UCSD i' like heaven. Really. 
Perhaps these protesters shou Id real-
ize that enrollment at UCSD is a 
privilege and an honor. 

If the university is, in fact , abus-
ing its TAs and RAs, my advice to 
those who feel offended or abused is 
simple: You should leave. Every stu-
dent has that opportunity, and trans-
ferring to another school is very easy 
in the U.S. Yeti doubt the problem is 
truly abuse by the departments.

competitive spiri t that insp ires 
acti on, it also creates tremen-
dous negati ve energy ,1I1d sucks 
up posi ti ve energy. An alliance 
between A.S . and the Guardiall 
would indicate to the adminis -
tration that the ~tudents mean 
busi ness and would crea te a 
more comfortable working 
atmosphere for the st udent s' two 
loudest voices . 

With the Guardia" as an ally, 
some much-needed puhlic rela-
tions work for the council could 
be accomplished. Timely and 
frequent coverage of A.S. pro-

It is fitting that a new council 
be full of ideas and interested in 
improving student life at UCSD. 
It is also crucia l that the students 
of UCS D make it possihle for 
the A.S. counci l to succ~ed by 
frequentl y and happily partici -
paling in the events and services 
provided to them. 

A hard-working cOlllll:il d()c~ 
nOI deserve apathy from the rcst 
of the student body. An 
improved campus life is only 
possible through the cooperation 
and effort s of all students. The 
UCSD environment is not deter-
mined by olle organization, hut 
by the entire community. 

forms poorly, for whatever reason, it 
wi ll be refl ected in that department 's 
national rankings. Since those rank-
ings are vi tal to department fundin g, 
and graduate input is considered, the 
quality of the graduate environment 
is a primary concern of each depart-
ment. But departments, like organi -
zations everyWhere, have to balance 
many demands. Result : Graduate 
students aren't pampered as much as 
they want to be. 

So [ ask the Gllardiarl 10 keep 
TAs like me in mind when covering 
this strike. And please assure my stu-
dent that I'll till be holding office 
hours and ' rt;,view sessions as 
promised and as I'm paid and funded 
to do. I also recommend that Ihe 
Guardiall take the time to poll the 
relevant populations in stories like 
these. For instance, what percentage 
or grad students support this threat-
ened strike? [fit is only the handful 
that allend the ASE meetings wbile 
the rest or u are busy with research. 
then I'm not impressed. Too often , 
the media cover the shrill eXlremists, 
while the substantive majority goes 
about its business. To wit, last year 
Newsweek ran a photo of UCSD grad 
students (all 20 of them) protesting at 
one of the on-campus intersections 
and billed it a a major event. 
Needless to say, [ was concemed that 
the world might misinterpret the 
actions of a few of my fellow TAs as 
a reflection of the opinions of the 
majority of g[aduate students at 
UCSD.

Famed Author Speaks at Price Center About 
Pros and Cons of Same-Sex Marriage 
FORUM: Andrew 
Sullivan discusses 
symbolic importance 
By Julia KulllH1ader 
Staff Writer 

NOIed author Andrew Sullivan 
spoke Friday to a group of 30 10 40 
people at the Price Centcr ahout his 
ncw work . Sallie-Sex Marriage: 
Pro and Con. 

His book investigates thc histo-
ry. politi cs . religion, economics 
and long-tcrm clTects or samc-scx 
marriages. 

Thc event, one or several activi-
ties scheduled to mark UCSD's 
May 6 to May 9 Gay Awareness 
Week. was sponsored by the 
Chancellor's Advisory Committee 
on Lesbian . Gay. Bi sexual and 
Transgender Issues in cooperation 
with the UCSD Bookstore. 

"Our guest today. Andrew 
Sullivan IS one of the most visible, 
most arti culate. most recognizable 
and mo,t respected spokespersons 
for gay issues in the United States 
today." said host Milton Pheg ley. 
ca mpw, commun ity planner. 

Sullivan began by updating the 
audicnce on the status of same-sex 
marriagl!s In Amcnca. 

" Wllh,n the next nlnc month, . 
11 \ highly likely thm two mcn anLi 
two WOIlll!n will he ic!,lall) Illarn~d 
In A Illl!nca." hl! .,aid. 

Su llivan saiLi hl! IS surpnsed hy 
how dosc gay Illcn and women arc 
10 ohwlnlng Ihe righl 10 marry. 

" When I liN \tarted wnllng 
ahout the ' UhJl'ct In 19!!9, I wmll! 
ahout II as an Intere,ting. in tellec-
tual and Illlportalll - I though t -
Illoral argumcnt to the equaht) 01 
gay mcn and wOlllcn." Sulh v,/n 
sa id " 1 nevt:r hc hel'~d that within a 
decade I would he gOing around thc 
cou nt ry tall.lIlg ahout a suhJcct that 

wa~ on the \crge of hecoming real 
Ity."

nize marriage," he sa id. " 1 think 
you will sec in the next year to 
two years second and third fronts 
being opened up at;ross the coun -
try." 

Sullivan added that he believes 
same-sex marriage is central to 
obtaining gay righls. 

"Somelimes I feel like a kid in a 
big house," he said . "There are 
many rooms ' in the house - some 
of them you ' re allowed to mess 
around in and scu ff up, and others 
you're supposed to be a little bit 
morc t;areful about. But, there ' 
one room that you ' rc really not 

pursuing thi s issue, presenting it 
clearly land] articulating, its cen-
trality has in any way diminished 
or set back any other issues in 
regard to gay men and women," 
he said. 

Sullivan argued that working 
for marriage equality actually 
advances gay eivil right s. 

" /t 's the most hasic bargaining 
tactic imaginable:' he said. " You 
go in with your highest bid and yuu 
sce what else they offer." 

As an example. Sullivan point-
ed to a dehate he participated in last 
Thursday night on the television 

supposed to go 
in." 

To Sullivan, 
for gay men and 
women that room 
is the institution 
of marriage. 

"Sometimes I feel 
like a kid In a big 
house. There are 
many rooms In the 
house - some of 

how "Politically 
Incorrect with Bill 
Maher." 

Sullivan said 

According to 
Sullivan, for gay 
men and women 
to have complete 
acce s to all 

them you're 
around to mess 

that another guest. 
Citizens United 
Chairman Floyd 
Brown, who is 
against sa mc-sex 
marri age. asked 
hi m why gay mcn 
and women would 
not just settle for 
"domcstic partner-
ship" instcad or 
I"narriagl.!.

" And II \ not

pointed out that

CROWDING: 
Students may be 
housed off campus 
Continued from page 1 

UC Berkeley and UC Davi s arc 
both underenrolled, whi Ie UC 
Santa Barbara has approxim3lely 
200 students than expected. 
Backer sllid. 

He estimated that the number of 
students ultimatcly showing up for 
classes in Ihe fall could drop to as 
low as 3.300 ur 3.400 - a number 
that Joseph Walson, vice chancellor 
for studenl affairs. said is till a lit -
tic 100 high for his comrort . 

'This is morc students than we 
anticipated, hut we think we ean 
make some adjustments ,lnd 
accommodate them well." Watson 
said. 'This is, if you will , an excess 
of riches - of someth ing good." 

Watson said he hoped thc num-
ber of enlering students would 
drop to between 3,100 and 3,150 
by the rail , 

UCSD admi ssions officers 
mailed out 13.300 acceptance let-
ters. hoping to ret;eive ),000 posi -
ti ve responses, Backer said. 
However. UCSD's top·lier rank -
ings and a variety or other reasons 
led to the higher-than-expeclcd 
yield. 

"We' re becoming a much more 
attractive university for ex~ellent 
students. " Walson said. 

Backer added that while 
detailed analyses will be per-
formed this week. preliminary fig-
ures indicates an increased number 
of African-Americans, Hispanics. 
Latinos and Nativc Americans 
than had been expecled. 

Last year, UCSD admitted 
II. 900 freshmen and expected 
2,8 50 of them to accept. In reality. 
2.753 students mailed in their 
deposits and enrolled last fall. 

According to Watson, depart-

ments will be working between 
now and July - when incoming 
freshmen register for classes - to 
adjust course offering and accom-
modate the extra sludents. 

"We ' re going to work hard to 
lind space for them," Watson said. 
" We' re going to do everything we 
can to accommodate these stu -
dents and give Ihem the best expe-
rience we can." 

Student Financial Services 

The UCSD Guardian 

Director Larry Bandi said his 
oflice is exploring various alterna-
tives for housi ng the additional 
students, including convening 
double rooms to trip les on a volun-
teer basis. 

Barrett said he would work 
with the college res idenl deans to 
figure OUI the detai Is of any such 
arrangements. 

"Housi ng is morc than j ust a 
roof over your head," Barrctt said. 

Director Vince 
De Anda sa id 
that whi Ie his 
office does it 
best job to eSli-
mate the number 
of student s 
requiring finan -
cial assistance. 
"it rooks like our 
projections were 
off: ' 

"Housing is more 
than just a roof 
ov.er your head. 
You can put 10 
people In a 
lounge, but then 
you Inconvenience 
35 more." 

"You can PUI 10 
peop le in a

nience 35 more." 

While Barrett

Housing & Din ing Services would negotiate 

tight ." he said. 
De Anda said UCSD awarded 

approximately S 104 million in 
financial aid this year Ihrough a 
combirullion of loans. grants and 
work-study, 

" We' re doing some number-
crunching and trying 10 see where 
we 're at." De Anda said. "It puts 
pressure on us. but we.' re not sure 
how much." 

" Usually we have enough 
money to fund all studems who 
apply by the priority deadline and 
give them a regular package," he 
added. 

However, De Anda said there 
may not be enough money to fund 
sludents who applied after the 
March 2 deadline, 

" It put s a little pressure on us to 
sec how we spread the money 
out." he sa id. 

Housing and Dining Services 

with nearby 
hotels like the Radisson Inn. Barrett 
said he would pay the hotel for its 
rooms. and students would shuttle 
to campus for classes and meals, 

Incoming freshmen are !:!Uaran-
teed housing for their first two 
years. and Barrett estimates he will 
be able to accommodate "all but 
about 40 guaranteed sludents.·' 

'This will be the tim time in 20 
years that by the first week of 
school we won't have a place for 
every freshman," he said. 

Barrell added thaI while the 
growth will probably speed up dis-
cussions on the future six th college 
- which will ultimate ly house 
450 students in residence halls and 
another 800 in apanmeniS - the 
new buildings will not materiali ze 
any time soon. 

"Even if you start today on the 
planning, iI 'S five years before you 
can open the door." he said.

"Coming Out" Impeded 
In the midst of burgeoning public awareness of 

homosexuality, UCSDs LGBA continues to 
struggle for recognition and jundl:ng 

By Jessica Scheppmann 
Guardian Reporter 

For many members of UCSD 's 
Lesbian , Gay and Bise)(ual 
Association (LGBA), the "coming 
out " epI sode on "Ellen" was more 
than a show that revealed what 
everyonc already knew about Ellen 
DeGeneres . It was a chance to 
reli ve their own experiences as a 
gay. lesbian, bisexual or transgen-
der. 

LGBA memhers said that , 
despite the socia l stigmatization or 
those individuals who publicize 
their se)(uality. DeGeneres' coming 
out was a positive move to raise the 
issue of lesbianisl11 in the media. 

"It 's very posilive to have a 
mainstream portrayal of a lesbian," 
said LGBA principle member 
Rebecca Lee. "You rarely sec them 
portrayed posi tively. Sexualit y 
itself is taboo. The gay community 
docsn't have a lot of role models in 
the I11cdi a loday. Often times gay 
character, arc portrayed as deviants 
(l r anti soc ial outcaSlS. It help,

ARENA 
What are your thoughts 

on the ASE Strike'? 
Interviews by Grace Jang 

Photography by Claire Schneider 

The TAs are definitely 
underpaid. But the effect of 
the strike isn ' t very strong 
because there aren ' t enough 
people mobilized, so it does-
n' t make much of an impres-
sion on the students. I f the 
reason they were striking was 
[better publicizedJ , the cause 
would be more effecti ve. 

Sharon Fawcett 
Revelle Senior 

I'm unaware of both sides. 
J know the flyers say 
"Support the TAs" but it 
doesn't really di scuss why 
we shou ld support them. J 
don' t really understand why 
the regents don't want them 
to unionize. I'm sure both 
sides have good reasons but I 
can't really take a side. 

Justin ".KG 
Muir Senior 

It's not working because 
they do it so much and it 
doesn 't seem that everyone 
takes them seriously. They 
always end up rescheduling 
secti ons for the student s. 
Some professors cancel class. 
some still have class. It does-
n' t secm as if it's as effc li ve 
as il cou ld he. 

Eric Raether 
Marshall Senior 

The graduale s lL1dcnl ~ are 
treated in a fcudal manner hy 
lhe institution. With all the 
work thcy do and the over-
load they get from the profes-
sors, it 's cynical to con~ider 
lhem apprcn lices ralh r than 
thc workers they arc. They 
deserve representation and 
acknowledgment as a union . 

David Klowden 
Muir Senior 

I'm a TA myself, but I'm . 
not part of that union. It's a 
legitimate cause. I' m glad 
they're out there doing some-
thing about it , getting atten-

. tion for themselves. I'm an 
undergraduate biology TA. I 
have no gripe with the biolo-
gy department so I have no 
reason to strike.

Organization trives 
for "awareness" 
Continued from page 20 
reads from So, YOII Want To Be A 
Lesbiall ... by Liz Tracey. 

"This book is a parody," 
Nguyen said . " It appeals to 
women, and we want to increase 
our female population. Right now 
LGBA has a lot of male members, 
and we fee l that our job as princi-
ple members is to bring in more 
people to the meetings. We watch 
what makes more people come. 
and try to do whal il takes to 
increase allendance." 
Upcomlne Events 

The LG BA will have a booth 
at the Sun God Festival to provide 
information and to sell T-shirts 
wi th the UCSD logo against a 
rainbow background . 

"These shi rts aren' t designed 
just for gay members," said 
Nguyen. "They are designed for 
anyone who wants to promote 
awareness and underslanding . 
Gay ·fri endly people who are 
straight hut not narrow, can wear 
these shirt s to supporl us," said 
Nguyen. 

A dance open to all sludents is 
scheduled for May 17. 

"Historically our dance is the 
most heavily·attended free dance 
of all the student organizations," 
said Maze. 

The LGBA office is located 
directly above Soft Reserve at the 
Old Sludent Center. Office hours 
vary, but members try to keep Ihe 
door open during "peak hours" for 
those needing help or support . 

Meeti ngs are held at the 
Graduate Student Association 
Center every Monday at 7 p.m. 
P yc hological and Counseling 
Services (P&CS) also sponsors 
workshops for gay and bisex.ual 
graduate and undergraduat e 
males. 

"It's a very welcoming envi-
ronment where guys can ask ques-
tions and discuss issues in a safe 
supportive and confidential envi -
ronment," said Maze, who works 
at P&CS. 

A lesbian and bi sex. ua l 
women's group meets every 
Tuesday from 7-8:30 p.m. at the 
Old Studenl Ce nter Conference 
Room One. Iho e interested can

Continued from page 14 
the horrible event is replayed 
over and over again in hi mind. 
How much easier it would have 
been if someone would have 
uttered the si mple words, ''Zip 
up your pants, bUllon your ski rt , 
pull down your shin, blow your 
nose ... " Even a subtle hand ges-
ture indicating the source of the 
PES would have sufficed. 

According to some religious 
practices, to humi liate someone 
is to kill him. How valiant an act 
it would be, if by sett ing aside a 
nat urall y uncomfo rtable reac-
tion. one would save another

STORM:sc

Continued from page 32 
The Triton~ had already di spatched 
the Regal. les~ than a week earlier, 
and knew they could it agai n. 

Comhining that confidence wi th 
sweet swingi ng, the ladies jumped 
to a 2-0 lead in the first inning. The 
Tritons put a leadoff hiller on hase 
in nearly every inning, amassing 12 
hit s. The team scored three more 
runs in the late innings. 

Meanwhi le, pitcher Mary Jane 
Otto barned the Rega ls, givi ng up 
only two meaningless runs in the 
seven th inning for the 5-2 victory . 
Error-free fi elding comhined with 
timely hitting and dominant pitch-
ing gave the women confidence as 
they prepared to face the Storm in 
the Regional Finals. 

Si mpson was equally ready for

the Tritons. Traveling west from 
Iowa, the Simp. on tcam looked to 
defend its No. I seeding. Already 
having lost once in the tournament, 
the Storm came ready to play. 

Simpson banked its hopes on the 
arm of wiry pitcher Kelly Schade. 
Schade hurled nothing hut heat for 
~even innings. striking out six . Al-
lowing no run~, she earned her 20th 
victo ry of t he season. 

Sc hueler again took the mound 
for the Tritons, but wuuld las t onl y

Schuelercontinued to bat in the lead-
off spot, going 2-4 to lead the team 
and add to her .590 on-base percent -
age for the tournament. 

Everything came down to Sun-
day aft ernoon's game. with the tire-
less Schade again leading the Storm 
agai nst OUo and an undeterred squad 
of Tritons.

That prospect changed as the

Simpson loaded the ha es wi th two 
outs , and Otto walked home a run . A 
two-run si ngle, a wild pitch, a double 
and a si ngle later, the inning ended 
with the Storm on top, 6-2. 

Though the Tritons wou ld rally 
in both the six th and the eventh , 
notching one run in the last inning. 
it would not be enough. The Storm 
thundered on, running its record to

The lesson: the Tritons can beat 
any team they step on the field 
with. The problem this season wa 
that they could also lose to just

the Tritons at times, but toward 
the end of their season, it appeared 
that they were finally shedding 
that shroud.

UCSD Finishes Strong 
TOURNEY: Tritons finished their 1997 season 
by splitting four games at La Verne Tourney

a chance at winning the tourn a-
ment kept us fired up ." By Jonah Nlsenson 

Staff Writer 
When your team sets a tour!1a-

ment record for the mos t games in 
overtime. it is usually an indica-
tion that you have played 
exceptionally well . Con-
s idering that the UCSD 
women's water polo team 
sent three of it s four games 
into OT in Ann Arbor, 

The Tritons' victory ca me Fri -
day , on the hee ls of a 9-1 loss to 
UCLA. the perennial tournament 
champion. Against the Univers it y 

of Maryland, UCSD 
played sti ngy ddense 
down t he stre tch and 
emerged victorious . 
Fres hman Dara Burch 
once agai n came through 
in the clutch with four 
goa ls, proving once again 

Larsen could not be stopped. In 
addi ti on to Caballero 's play , which 
earned her All -Tournament rec -
ognition. Burch scored two more 
goals, conti nuing herchanned play 
of late. However, in the second 
three -minute over time period. 
Slippery Ro~k sent the Tritons 
away cmpty-handed . 

In the seven th -p lace game. 
UCSD matched up against USC. 
The Trojans had bea ten their Tri -
ton counterparts 9-3 in their last 
face-off in February and were ex-
pecting an easy win . They had no 
such luck, as once again the Tri -
tons took the game to OT. With 
I: I I left in overt i me, UCS D was 
down 7-6. Wi th a Trojan ejection. 
the Tritons had a six-on-rive op-
portunity , and they decided to 
bring their goalie up the pool to 
give themselves an added advan-
tage with an ext ra player on the 
offensi ve end . This backfi red when 
a shot went wide of the goal. Icav-
ing an open net on the opposite 
side. USC promptly took advan-
tage of the 0PP0rlunityand went 
ahead, 8-6. The game ended with 
USC on top, 8-6. but UCSD still 
had plenty to be happy about. 

Talk abo ut a roller-coaster 
seaso n. The UCSD base ha ll 
team's 1997 campaig n has fi -

nall y come to a 
complete stop , and 
as the Tri IOns de-
part they wi ll take 
with th t!m memo-
ri es of so me great 
hi ghs and lows. 

That's th e kind of lea rn 
Fletcher has - thi s group would 
never roll over. it has too much 
heart to allow that to happen. 
They came out against Red lands 
and played hard , but were 
outlasted in cxt ra innings. 8-7. ~ 
Thei r hopes of reachi ng the 
postseason were dashed. but the 
Tritons took out their frustrations 

Mi ch., while competing in 
th e NCAA Champion -
ships. one would have to conc lude 
that this young team played with 
something that can never he 'uh-
stituted : heart. 

As a result of their ·crappy . no 
nonsense play , the Tritons were 
ranked eig hth nationally when they 
finished the tournamen t. one slot 
higher than when they entered . De-
spi te losing three of their four 
games. two of whi ch were heart -
breaking losses. the women of San 
Diego pulled out a stunning 9-M 
win over the Universi ty of Mary-
land, a learn they had lost to earlier 
in the season . 

While UCSD didn ' t have high 
hopes of winning the whole tour-
nament. Head Coach Denny 
Harper wanted to at least move up 
one spot in the rankings . This has 
been one of Harper's main goal s 
throughout his years as head coach. 
and he has managed to achieve it 
every time hi s teams go to Nation -

to be the go-to player in tight si tu -
ations. 

On Saturday, the Tri tons faced 
long-time ri va l Slippery Rock in 
anot her quality double-overtime 
game. This was the heartbreaker. 
as UCSD led 5-2 entering the 
fo urth quarter. A coach's ni ght-
mare ensued when the referees 
ejected four UCS D players in the 
fourth , essentiall y turning it into a 
nine-an-seven game. 

"A ll we ask is that the rcfe rees 
are consi stent ," Harper said . "What 
the reI' had ca lled in the first three 
quart ers was different than what 
he called in the fourth quarter. We 
had four ejections in the fourth 
[compared to two in the second] ." 

Anchoring San Diego 's defense 
was senior Shawna Caballero. who 
played brilliant 2-meter defense 
against the 1996 player of the year. 
Robbie Larsen. Unfortunate ly. 
with the four ejections in the fourth . 

"We are a young Ie am that got 
a lot of cl(perience this weekend." 
Harper said. "All in all ie was a 
fantasti c weekend in which we 
overachieved . Dara Burch really 
emerged as a team leader," 

The final gamcs 
of the regular sea-

son for the Tri tons ca me May J-
4, at the La Verne Tournament. 
This tournament was crucia l to 
UCSD's postseason hopes. In it 
they competed against Di vision 
III rival s La Verne. Redlands and 
Chapman . Specifically, UCSD 
needed victo ri es agai nst 
Chapman - the No .2 ranked 
squad in the Western region. In 
order to drop the Panthers from 
playoff consideration. the Tri -
tons nceded to sweep through 
the tournament. 

But it didn't happen . The Tri -
ton s opened the tournament 
against Chapman. but errors com-
bined with timely Panther hit -
ting spelled doom for UCSD. The 
Tritons ended up losing 18-5, 
but the loss did not demoralize 
the team . 

"We weren't at all down."Tri-
ton Head Coach Robert Fletcher 
sa id. "Knowing that we still had 

on their hosts. defeati ng La Verne 
twice on Sunday to take third 
ovcra ll. 

Now the Tritons are looking 
with wide eyes toward nex t yea r, 
and seei ng exci ting things . 

"The team will be hungry," 
Fletcher said. ''That' s the kind of 
players [the Tritons] arc . The sea-
son might be disappointing to 
them in certain areas, but now 
they know what needs to be done 
Ito get to the postseason] and I 
think they can do it." 

The Tritons showed this year 
that they can in fact beat some of 
the great teams. They defeated 
Cal Lutheran. one of the top 
teams in Division III , and their 
two losses to the Kingsmen were 
extremely close. But the biggest 
win of the year. and quite possi-
bly in Triton regular-season his-
tory, was the 13-4 drubbi ng of 
San Diego State. The Divi sion I 
Aztecs had been ranked in the

top 25 for most of the season , and 
the Triton tra veled across town 
and thrashed them. 

The lesson: the Tritons can beat 
any team they step on the field 
with. The problem this season wa 
that they cOllld also lose to jusl 
about anyone. Inconsistency ki lied 
the Tritons at times , but toward 
the end of their season, it appeared 
that they were finally shedding 
that shroud.

cess in the sense that we matured."

UCSD Finishes Strong 
TOURNEY: Tritons finished their 1997 season 
by plitting four games at La Verne Tourney

a chance at winning the tourna-
ment kept us fired up." By Jonah Nisenson 

Staff Writer 
When your team se ts a tourpa-

ment record for the mos t games in 
overtime, it is usuall y an ind ica-
tion that you have pl ayed 
cgept iona lly well. Con-
sidering that the UCS D 
wo men's water polo team 
sent three of its four games 
into OT in Ann Arhor, 

The Tr itons' vic tory eame Fri-
day. on the heels of a 9-1 loss to 
UC LA, the perenni al tournament 
champion. Aga inst the University 

o f Mar y land , UC SD 
pl ayed s t ingy de fense 
down th e stretc h and 
emerge d vic to rio us. 
Freshm a n Dara Burch 
once agai n caille th rough 
in th e cl utch wi th fo ur 
goa ls, proving once again 

Larsen could not be sto pped. rn 
addition to Caballero's pl ay, which 
earned her All -Tournament rec-
ognition, Burch s~o red two more 
goa ls. cont inu i ng her charmed play 
o f latc. However, in th e second 
three- minut e ove rt ime period, 
S lippery Rock sent thc Tritons 
away elll pty-handed . 

In the seventh -place ga me, 
UCSD matched up again t USc. 
T he Trojans had beaten thei r Tri -
to n count erpart s 9-3 in thei r las t 
face-o ff in February and were ex-
pecting an easy wi n. They had no 
such luck, as once again the Tri-
to ns took the game to OT. With 
I : I I left in ove rt ime, U SD was 
do wn 7-6. With a Trojan ejection. 
the Tritons had a six-o n-fi ve op -
po rtunit y, and they dec ided to 
bring thei r goa lie up the pool to 
gi ve themse lves an added advan-
tage with an e ~t ra player on the 
offcnsi vc end. This backfired when 
a shot went wide of the goal.leav-
ing an open net on the oppos ite 
side. USC prompt ly took advan-
tage of the 0pp0rlunityand went 
ahead, 8-6. Tile game ended with 
USC on top , 8-6, but UCSD still 
had plenty to be happy about. 

Talk about a ro ller-coas ter 
se aso n. Th e UC SD base hall 
team's 1997 campaign has fi-

na ll y co me to a 
complete stop. and 
as the Tritons de-
part they will take 
with them memo-
ri es of ·ome great 
hi ghs and lows. 

Th at 's th e kind o f tea m 
Fletcher has - thi s group would 
never roll over, it has too much 
heart to allow that to happen. 
They came out against Redlands 
and pl aye d hard, but were 
outlasted in ex tra innings, 8-7 . -
Their hopes of reachin g the 
pos tseason were dashed, but the 
Tritons took out their frustrations 

Mich., whilecompeting in 
the NCA A Champi on-
ships, one would have to concl ude 
th at thi s young tea m pl ayed wi th 
something that can never be suh-
stituted: hea rt. 

As a result of their scrappy, no 
nonse nse play , the T ritons were 
ranked eighth nati onall y when they 
finished the tournament . one slot 
hi gher than when they entereu. De-
spite los ing three of their four 
games, two of which were heart -
breaking losses. the women of San 
Diego pulled out a stunning 9-8 
win over the University of Mary -
land, a team lhey had lost 10 earlier 
in the season. 

Whil e UCSD didn't have high 
hopes of winning the whole tour -
nament, Head Coach Denny 
Harper wanted to at least move up 
one spot in the rankings . This has 
been one of Harper's main goals 
throughout his years as head coach, 
and he has managed to achieve it 
every time hi s teams go to Nation-

to be the go- to pl aye r in ti ght situ -
ations. 

On Saturday, the Tritons faced 
long- time ri val Slippery Rock in 
another quality double-overtime 
game. Thi s was the heartbreaker. 
as UCS D led 5-2 entering the 
fourth qu art er. A coach's night -
mare ensued when the re fe rees 
ejected four UCS D players in the 
fourth . essentiall y turning it into a 
nine-on-seven game. 

·· AII we ask is that the referees 
arc consistent," Harper said . " What 
the ref had called in the fir st three 
quarters was different than what 
he called in the fourth quarter. We 
had four ejections in the fourth 
[compared to two in the second} ." 

Anchoring San Diego's defense 
was senior Shawna Caball ero. who 
played brilliant 2-meter defense 
against the 1996 player of the year, 
Robbie Larsen. Unfortunately , 
with the four ejeelions in the fourth, 

"We are a young team that got 
a lot of experience thi s weekend," 
Harper said. " All in all iI, was a 
fantasti c weekend in which we 
overachieved . Dara Burch really 
emerged as a team leader." 

The final games 
o f the regular sea-

son for the Tritons came May 3-
4, at the La Verne Tournament. 
Th is tournament wa. crucial to 
UC D's pos tseason hopes. In it 
they competed against Di vision 
III ri val s La Verne. Red lands and 
Chapman . Specifi ca ll y, UCSD 
needed victo ries aga i nst 
Chapman - the No.2 ranked 
squad in the Western region. rn 
order to drop the Panthers from 
playoff consideration, the Tri-
tons needed to sweep through 
the tournament. 

But it didn ' t happen . The Tri -
tons opened the tournament 
against Chapman, but errors com-
hined with time ly Panther hit -
tingspelled doom forUCSD. The 
Tritons ended up 10 ing 18-5, 
but the loss did not demoralize 
the team . 

. We weren ' t at alIdown." Tri -
ton Head Coach Robert Fletcher 
said . "Knowing that we still had 

on th ei r hosts, defeat ing La Verne 
twice on unday to take third 
overall. 

ow the Trit ons are looking 
with wide eyes toward next year, 
and see ing exciting things. 

"The team will be hungry," 
Fletcher sa id . "That 's the kind of 
pl ayers Ithe Tritons I arc . The sea-
so n mi ght be di sappointing to 
them in certain areas. but now 
they know what needs to be done 
I to get to the post season I and I 
think they can do it." 

The Tritons showed this year 
that they can in fact beat some of 
the great teams. They defeated 
Cal Lutheran . one of the lOp 
teams in Division m, and their 
two losses to the Kingsmen were 
elt tremely close. But the biggest 
win of the year, and quite possi-
bly in Triton regular-season his-
tory . was the 13-4 drubbing of 
San Diego State . The Division' 
Aztecs had been ranked in the

Padre Sorrow, 
Dodger Delight 

Whal' s wrong with the 
Padre? Is there even an 
answer to what has become the 
most commonly asked queM ion 
in the San Diego area? After a 
4- 1 ~ tart to the 1997 season, 
the Padres have quickly gone 
from the penthouse to the 
doghouse. 

As a die-hard Dodgers fan , 
it doesn ' t bother me one bit 
that the Padre\ arc currently 
locked in the hasement of the 

ational League We!> !. But 
because the Padres aren ' t a 
threat to Los Angeles right 
now, I can bring myse lf to 
ponder the Pad 's wo !>. 

Offense ~hould not be a 
problem for the Friars; they 
certainly ha ve enough power in 
the line-up. There's Tony 
Gwy nn who, for the past seven 
year!>, has reigned a<, the 

ational Leagut: batllng 
champion. But (Inc man alone 
tan not be expt:cted to carry an 
entire ball club. The other eight 
men definitely net:d to wake up 
their hats- especia ll y Greg 
Vaughn and atlOnal League 
Most Valuable Playe r Kt:n

Maybe the Padrt:s just 
aren't used to willning. 'Ide

the Padres have consistently 
been a mediocre team.

Storm Washes Away Triton Hopes 
SIMPSON: The Iowa squad cored five run in the fifth to eliminate UCSD and a trip to Final Four 

Mark Pall rson/ GuardIan 

Airborne: Kelsey Bennet gives It her all. but can 't make the catch. 

By Kevin McLaughlin 
Senior Slaff Wfller 

It wa!> the proverbial calm herore 
the Storm . For two games, the 

womcn '~ softball team played its 
best ball of the year 
when it mattered most 
- in the playoffs. After 
soundly )', panking two 
nvals in the opening 
rounds of competition, 
the women ran into the 

impwn ollege Storm 
in the Regional Finals. 
Pl ayi ng in a douhl e-
elimination format , the ladies lost to 
the lop-seeded Storm 7-3 in the fi -
nale Sunday afternoon . 

Thc team 's loss was not for lack 
of effort. confidcnce ordesire, all of 
which are comp()nent~ of a cham-
pion. Despit e playi ng excellent team 
~() ftball. the womcn could not \ur-
mount soml: fast pitching and one 
big offen ~ 1 ve IIlnlng by Si mp!>on, 
coming Just short of reaching the 
Final Four. 

As a who le. lhe tournamcnt wa!> 
an outstanding performam:e hy the 
team. Playing at Triton Softha ll 

leld, the womcn opened the w m-
petiti on Friday ni g ht aga in s t 

hapman, a team they lost 10 three 
limes Ihls year. The women knew 
they could beat Champan this time 
- a fact that thcy aptl y demon-
stratcd by emharra ~!> ing the Pan-
thers in the game. 

Sen ior Kri stin c hueler, who 
e:.lrned All -Tournament honors at 
fiN hase, p ' rlmmed pitching du-
ties agalll\t hapman' s mighty hat:-- . 

Despite allowing two runs in the 
early innings, Schueler ett led down 
10 scatt er nine hits over a complete-
game performance. She helped her 
cau e by gOing 3-4 at the plate, 

including a tw o-run 
homer in lhe third in-
ning. 

With atwo-run triple 
by ri ght fielder Erin 
Cornell and a series of 
si ng les, the Tri tons pi led 
on five more runs in the 
fifth inning. 

The women ap-
peared at case againM pitcher Brit -
tany arlson, who entcred the game 
with an 18-2 record. Her replace-
ment could do little more. CSD 
tallied a total or 16 hits in the game, 
Iinishing with an 11 -3 victory. For 
the Tritons, the win was a sweel 
vi ndi c:.l tl on after a ser i e~ of near-
misses in the regular season. 

" When it was important , we 
showed thcm- we beat lhem pretty 
hadl y," se ni or ~ h o rt s top Missy 
Belmer said. " It was a huge win for 
next year. " 

Triton Head Coac h Patricia 
Gerckens agreed. 

''To lose to a team three times 
and then heat I ill is the true defini-
tion or a champi o n," she said. "This 
learn hasn't had a lot of respect in 
lhe past, hut litl ea rned it thi s week-
end ." 

The Triton~ kept the momentum 
going through an evening matchup 
agai n:-- t al Lut heran, which had 
heaten impson earlier in the day.

CoA soc/ate Spons Ed/tor 

There 1\ an argument raging 
throughout CSD ahout tht: contro-

Should we 1110VC up'! an we handle 
the II1creased talent level 01 our com-

leti c s 'holarships in order to com-
pete? What would be the linancial 
repercussions of such a move,! These 
arc just some of the lue~tions being 
asked around campus. While these 
questions arc being asked in offices 
and committees, there arc answers 
bing given on the playing field .

"On e you get to the hampion-
