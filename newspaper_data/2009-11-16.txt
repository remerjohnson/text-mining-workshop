Fee Increase 
Drives Students 
to LA Protest

By Kashi Khorasani
Contributing Writer

Hundreds of students have signed up to descend upon the UC Board of Regents meeting at UCLA this week, a final effort to protest the proposed 
32-percent student-fee increase. The regents will meet from 
Nov. 17 to Nov. 19 to discuss policy related to the univer-
sity’s funding deficit, among other pressing items.

On Wednesday, the board is expected to 
authorize a new batch of student-fee increas-
es that would raise in-state undergraduate 
tuition by an additional $1,391 annually, and 
nonresident undergraduate fees by $1,469.

A group of UCSD students, including sev-
eral A.S. Councilmembers, will shuttle to LA 

on Tuesday to join the protest. 
“I think it’s largely assumed that they’re going to pass 

the fee increases, but we have to have our voices heard at 
every step of the process,” Revelle College senior and UCSD 
Coalition to Save Our Futures member Sam Jung said. “At

In an effort to address some of the 
health ramifications of California’s large 
immigrant population, the University of 
California launched the Center of Expertise 
on Migration and Health on Nov. 9 — part 
of its new Global Health Institute. 

The COEMH, to be located at UCSD, 
was created to examine the impact that 
large population movements have on both 

the destination country and the migrating 
population’s country of origin. The pro-
gram will pay particular attention to conse-
quences that changes in federal health-care 
policy have on California’s refugee and 
immigrant population.

“Potentially sweeping changes in federal 
health care and immigration law and poli-
cies … will create an unprecedented natural 
laboratory for studying the effects of policy 
change on immigrants’ and refugees’ access 
to health care, propensity to seek health 

care, ability to pay for care... and health 
outcomes,” COEMH co-director Wayne 
Cornelius said in a statement.

The COEMH will focus on four areas: 
behavioral and socioeconomic deter-
minants on health; health outcomes in 
migrants’ communities of origin and des-
tination; children’s health; and healthcare 
delivery and policy.

“By bringing together social scientists, 

Regents are expected to vote to raise
student fees by 32 percent, expand
coverage of financial-aid plan.

A
one- or two-hour graveyard 
set can get lonely for a radio 
deejay, but at least she has her 
listeners. Unfortunately, the 
student spin doctors at KSDT 

radio don’t have that luxury.
“I know how frustrating it is working 

at the radio station when you’re doing 
your set, and you check the numbers and 
see only one or two, four people listen-
ing at the most — and that was on a 
good day,” said A.S. Campuswide Senator 
Adam Kenworthy, recalling his days as a 
disc jockey at KSDT, UCSD’s 41-year-old 
student-run radio station.

Kenworthy may just have suffered a 
shoddy time slot, but considering KSDT 
doesn’t currently broadcast on AM or 
FM, student deejays don’t have much of 
a chance at listenership. Without a radio 
signal, the indie station can’t reach the stu-
dent population as easily as other college 
stations, said KSDT General Manager and 
Sixth College senior Meredith Wong.

Currently, the only place listeners can 
tune in to KSDT’s underground-only, 
“fiercely independent” programming 
is online or through the tinny speakers 
outside its tucked-away headquarters in 
the Student Center. But if a current bid to 
acquire an FM signal is successful, accord-
ing to Wong, the station’s number of fol-
lowers could reach grand new proportions.

Research Team Pieces Together Genome Puzzle

By Connie Qian
Contributing Writer

A group of UCSD bioengineers 
announced a breakthrough on Nov. 9 
in the annotation of human genomes. 
They had identified a clearer frame-
work of a genome’s contents — the 
genes and regulatory elements that 
define hereditary traits.

According to the researchers, their 
more comprehensive framework may 
assist in the creation of energy-effi-
cient biofuels and new medicines.

Understanding genomes has been 
a hot topic in scientific research since 
the mid-1990s, when the Human 
Genome Project was launched in 
an effort to identify all genes in the 

human body. Despite the project’s 
completion in 2003, many details 
remained unclear due to the high 
complexity of the task, which involved 
compiling data for over 20,000 genes.�

“Genome sequences indicate 
strings of letters, but we didn’t know 
what they meant,” said Byung-Kwan 
Cho, a lead researcher in the UCSD 
bioengineering department. “It’s like a 
secret code. To understand a genome, 
we have to know what those strings 
mean.”�

The “secret code” of a genome is 
its DNA — the genetic instructions 
for the development and function of 
an organism. Genes are composed of 
DNA segments containing the blue-
print for the construction of other 
cells.�

“The annotation of the DNA 
sequence of an organism is of central 
importance in genomic sciences,” 
UCSD researcher Bernhard Palsson 
said. “It informs us about the location 
of the genes [and] their regulatory and 

structural elements. A DNA sequence 
is just a series of letters. The annota-
tion gives information about what this 
series of letters means.”�

Although scientists have been 
annotating genes for many years, 
UCSD researchers articulated the 
process to identify the exact makeup 
and location of genome components. 
Using tools like microwaves, sequenc-
ers and mass spectronomy, research-
ers identified a clearer framework 
for genomes and their regulatory 
elements.�

Cho said the discovery will help 
the future of genetic research by mini-
mizing the “trial and error” process 
scientists currently use when sequenc-
ing genes. 

“Lots of people are generating data 
sets, but there is much more informa-
tion in them,” Cho said. “We have 
to use this information to discover 
something, to explain something, to 
understand cell or biological systems.”�

The discovery could have major 

implications for the creation of biofu-
els, like bioethanol. As natural energy 
sources become more costly, biofuels 
are considered by many scientists 
to be a more efficient alternative. 
Through synthetic biology, research-
ers will be able to use the newfound 
information about genomes to design 
sources of biofuel such as microorgan-
isms, plants and bacteria. 

Cho said the development could 
also one day play a role in the fight 
against human illness, as many diseas-
es are caused by pathogenic genes that 
can be cured through the refinement 
of their genomes. 

“To make drugs, we have to know 
which gene has to be destructed by 
the medicine,” Cho said. “In that case, 
the regulation of those genes is very 
important to design drugs. One medi-
cine will destroy the regulations of 
very pathogenic genes.”

DO YOU THINK FEE-HIKE  
PROTESTS HAVE INFLUENCED 
EXECUTIVE DECISIONS? 
VOTE ONLINE.

√  Yes
√  No
√  I don’t know

Afghanistan’s presidential runoff election was originally scheduled for Nov. 7, but challenger Abdullah Abdullah dropped out of the race because he was 
convinced that the Afghan government had manipulated the results. In response, the government rushed to extend Hamid Karzai’s presidency. President 
Barack Obama’s support of Karzai’s extended term calls into question his goals for the nation — and may discourage lasting Afghan democracy.

The U.S. government’s stance on the recent presidential election in 
Afghanistan between Hamid Karzai and 
Abdullah Abdullah could easily delegitimize 
the Afghan democratic process.

When the people of Afghanistan origi-
nally voted on Aug. 20, Karzai was instantly 
announced the winner, and the U.S. gov-
ernment applauded his re-election. But as 
evidence surfaced that the election results 
had been tainted by governmental fraud, the 
Obama administration changed its stand-
point and pushed for a second election. 

However, after the runoff, Obama still 
praised Karzai’s re-election as a success. This 
sudden attitude shift and his support for 
such a sketchy election arouse suspicion as 
to whether Obama just wants to maximize 
American influence like all the past politi-
cians he’s criticized, and cheapens the world’s 
perception of Middle-Eastern democracy. 

Other leaders and media outlets around 
the world have taken a critical stance on 
the election. The New York Times ques-
tioned whether the democratic process in 
Afghanistan could proceed at all, consid-
ering a fair election was never truly held. 
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown 
criticized Karzai as an obstacle rather than a 
solution to Afghanistan’s corruption.

If the U.S. wants to promote democracy, 
it must stick to unwavering ideals. And if the 
Western world stops caring about freedom 
in Afghanistan, the people of Afghanistan 
will have little democracy left to cling to.

Once Abdullah dropped out of the race, the choice to declare Hamid Karzai pres-
ident was necessary to Afghanistan’s progress.

A single-candidate election would have 
been a mere formality. Whether or not there 
was a consensus that Karzai was the best can-
didate for the job, he would have remained 
president regardless of the outcome of such an 
election.

The onset of Afghanistan’s harsh winter — 
which often complicates communication and 
traveling — and the Taliban’s threat of vio-
lence against polling places made holding the 
election problematic to begin with. Its cancel-
lation came as a relief to election organizers.

On Nov. 10, the U.N. General Assembly 
deemed Karzai’s victory legitimate. The U.N. 
accepted that Afghanistan still has obstacles 
on the road to democracy, but that Afghan 
authorities are now working hard to ensure 
a fair process. Obama’s support, as well, may 
just be just the push the Afghan democracy 
needs to secure future credibility.

With the tumultuous election settled and a 
stable Afghan administration in place, Obama 
can finally move forward with his declaration 
to deploy more troops. He’s currently con-
sidering sending about 30,000 more troops 
to Afghanistan, who he hopes can bring new 
order to the unstable region. Obama ulti-
mately wants to see an Afghan government 
that can control internal conflict and terror-
ism — and the U.S. government’s support of 
the election results (questionable or not) may 
help push the country in that direction.

Obama’s congratulation of Hamid Karzai on his reelection indicates a very real 
possibility of ulterior motives linked to his 
upcoming deployment of additional troops.

It is widely assumed that Karzai, 
who is currently serving his fifth year as 
Afghanistan’s president, was hand-picked 
by the United States. The Afghan president 
expressed his close relationship with the U.S. 
in a 2008 interview when he said, “If I am 
called a puppet because we are grateful to 
America, then let that be my nickname.” 

Yet the resignation of Matthew Hoh, the 
top U.S. official in the Zabul province of east-
ern Afghanistan in September, demonstrated 
that even government higher-ups have grown 
weary of the war. “My resignation is based not 
upon how we are pursuing this war, but why 
and to what end,” Hoh said in a statement.

One possible reason to continue the 
Afghan occupation may be to get a hand on 
the virtually untapped oil and natural gas 
reserves. It is not uncommon for a nation to 
back a leader militarily in order to secure a 
self-indulgent deal. Karzai will make it hap-
pen, and the U.S. could provide troops in 
exchange for cheaper resources.

But convenient as negotiating with a 
president who’s willing to comply with our 
every request may be, that leader isn’t worth 
much if he’s not popularly elected — and for 
that to happen, serious reform is called for in 
Afghanistan’s electoral system.

For most of us, the holiday sea-son provides ample opportunity to throw all calorie-counting 
inhibitions into the gusts of winter 
wind and gorge ourselves shamelessly.

But in my family, a string of 
birthdays kicks off the holiday season 
early. This past Friday, my dad came 
into town from Singapore to celebrate 
his 52nd birthday with us, and we 
decided to throw a reunion potluck. 
Always starved for column inspira-
tion, I jumped on this opportunity for 
culinary/literary greatness. 

The potluck’s theme was Indian, 
and to contribute, I’d have to take a 

step out of my formulaic comfort zone 
to bust out more challenging, Emeril-
esque ethnic cuisine.

Naturally, I sought my grandmoth-
er’s assistance. My dish of choice had 
to accommodate the vegetarians in 
the family and yet stay simple enough 
for my novice (though slowly expand-
ing) cooking capacity. 

Accordingly, Grandma suggested a 
curry called vegetable makanwala — a 
collection of onions, carrots, green 

beans, cauliflower 
and peas mixed with 
an Indian cottage 
cheese called paneer 
(which can be found 
at most international 
markets), simmered 
in a rich, milk-based 
curry.

With the flash 
of a knife, I filled six cups with diced 
onions, carrots, green beans and 
cauliflower. I then sauteed the onions 
in vegetable oil until they browned, 
adding the carrots, green beans, cauli-
flower and peas at two-minute inter-
vals (in that precise order, to ensure 
each vegetable would cook to its ideal 
texture — bendable, but not soggy). 

Once the veggies were cooked, 
I added a few pinches of curry and 
chili powder (an old pro, Grandma 
bypassed the measuring spoon), 
instantly releasing a pungent aroma 
as it hit the veggies. After adding the 
chili, I poured two cups of water in 
the mix and let it simmer for five 
minutes. 

Now that things were really sim-
mering, I created a thick milky solu-
tion by stirring two teaspoons of rice 
flower into two cups of milk, and 
—  after five minutes had passed — I 
added the flour-thickened milk. I 
then stirred in the collection of spicy 
veggies, turned down the burner for a 
slow boil, added the paneer — and it 
was ready to serve.

My next undertaking was one of 
Dad’s favorite desserts: a rice-pudding 
relative called kheer. Making the stuff 
from scratch can be an excruciatingly 
long affair, so my grandmother taught 
me a much easier shortcut, which she 
learned from her best friend in col-
lege. The recipe required one cup of 
pohe (flattened Indian rice flakes that 
can be found at most international 
markets), one cup of water, five cups 
of milk, one cup of sugar, one can of 
evaporated milk and a few pinches of 
saffron and cardamom. 

The first step was to fry the pohe 
in some teaspoons of vegetable oil

ON CAMPUS  — In such a technology-driven age, it’s hard 
to imagine what we can’t get with the push of a button — 
including, thanks to UCSD podcasts, the surround-sound 
lecture experience. The only crimp in the lecture-from-
home concept is that, sadly, Academic Computing Services 
hasn’t yet convinced roughly four out of every five Center 
Hall professors that they should utilize the service. But when 
large classes are held in podcast-ready lecture halls, there’s 
no excuse not to use the technology we’ve already paid for.

The decision to podcast or not to podcast is left entire-

ly up to the professor, many of whom choose not to do so. 
Of all the classes in Center Hall that could be recorded, 
only 20 percent of them are actually podcasted.

The relatively new program, which saw its first instal-
lations on campus in 2006 and launched its first year of 
full-fledged broadcasting in 2007, allows students to listen 
in on their professors from the comfort of their sofa dents. 
In some cases (where a camera-to-computer hookup can

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lázaro

Dear Editor,
With the return of the CalPIRG 

pledge patrol to Library Walk, some 
will undoubtedly be avoiding the 
battlefield. It seems a stark contrast to 
the pledging of a few weeks prior. I’ve 
gone through this for the past three 
years, and the CalPIRG pledge patrol 
litters the sidewalks like mines. And 
I, for one, think them all the more 
important for their obtrusiveness.

How many people can you 
say actively stick up for you? How 
many of them are strangers? Maybe 
I’m an exception, but there aren’t 
many strangers I know that are 
willing to look after my interests. 
And, as a college student, I need all 
the help I can get between buying 
$150 textbooks updated with “new” 
material. I just want rest, so who has 
time to fight all these battles over 
textbooks and tuition? 

CalPIRG does.
To their eternal credit, they have 

enough minions looking out for 
people to actually produce results. 
Last year we saw the passage of 
Proposition 1A, a measure which 
green lighted a high-speed rail 
line from San Francisco to Los 
Angeles — one that will be vital 
in alleviating transit stress on the 
student population from both the 
UC campuses and those in the 
CSU system. What makes this so 
astounding is that it was passed in 
the face of a major financial crisis. 
CalPIRG, among others, fought hard 
in Sacramento, because students 
and other Californians needed an 
efficient means between Northern 
and Southern California. They went 
through all of that trouble, all of those 
hours of work, for others. 

Say you want to protest anything 
(liberal or conservative). What can 
you do as a UCSD student? Where do 
you go? You could protest on campus, 
which, under the best possible 
conditions, would convince several 
students to your cause, but it wouldn’t 
be visible to lawmakers. We can 
neither be in Washington DC nor in 
Sacramento, but we can want to make 
a difference, to make our individual 
lives as students better. I may not be 
able to do it, but CalPIRG can. At the 
beginning of every quarter, my books 
drain me of what little I was able to 
save during the immediate holiday. 
CalPIRG has already acted on this 
problem by building support amongst 
faculty and departments to accept 
lower-cost textbooks. Would I — or 
could I — get that sort of assistance 
from a frat or almost anyone else? 

No. For this reason, I want to urge 
my fellow students to talk to those 
people with clipboards. They will, for 
the next week, haunt Library Walk 
regardless, but by talking to them 
you have that much more control in 
guiding them to help you. Because 
at the end of the day, they wouldn’t 
be on the sidewalk talking to people 
about volunteering or helping if they 
didn’t believe it would help.

and butter. Once the pohe turned a 
creamy white, I added a cup of water, 
let it simmer for a few more minutes 
(while stirring) and slowly poured in 
the five cups of milk to keep it from 
curdling. 

After some 15 minutes of periodic 
stirring, the milk had condensed 
to about half its original volume. I 
added a can of evaporated milk, a cup 
of sugar and a pinch of saffron and 
ground cardamom to finish it off. 

The result was a thick, milky 
delight — topped off with a few sliced 
almonds for presentation points.

My family’s snarky reception to 
the dishes — as evidenced by my 

uncle’s fake dry heave upon tast-
ing the first bite — suggested their 
approval in a perverse, sarcastic way 
that characterizes most of our interac-
tions. I knew from the beginning that 
my tasters would be a rough crowd, 
but the speed at which the dinner 
was devoured led me to believe they 
might have genuinely enjoyed it. 

My dad, who had no previous 
knowledge of my culinary endeavors, 
even told me that my kitchen skills 
put his own to shame — which, given 
the fact that his are nonexistent, 
could’ve been a back-handed compli-
ment, had his trip to the kitchen for 
seconds not suggested otherwise.

Aside from the obvious satisfac-

tion of seeing my dishes go over well 
with my toughest critics, the experi-
ence also made me realize I could 
kill a yearly holiday problem with the 
same stone: gift-giving. 

With just a few months’ cooking 
practice, I’ve uncovered the solution 
to my poor present-purchasing skills. 
Those excruciating 30 minutes it 
takes to park at the mall during the 
peak holiday hours could be much 
more efficiently spent baking up a 
storm — because if there’s one thing 
more endearing than a Hallmark 
card with a couple bills slipped in it 
(which I’ve been known for the past 
few years) it’s an oven-fresh batch of 
chocolate-chip cookies.

6 THE UCSD GUARDIAN� MONDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2009� NEWS



NEWS� MONDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2009� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 7 

this point in time, we’re going to 
voice our opinion and vote ‘No’ on 
the fee increases to send a message 
to the state to fund public education 
the way it was funded 10, 15 years 
ago. Of course, there is a possibility 
that the students can change the vote 
of the regents, but we’re going into it 
with the mindset that they’re prob-
ably going to pass it.”

Councilmembers are organizing 
bus rides to UCLA for students inter-
ested in joining the protest. About 
200 students from across the UC 
system are expected to protest at 
UCLA and participate in the public-
comment period. 

“We’re going to step up our lobby-
ing efforts and really go after in-dis-
trict legislators, and really press the 
gubernatorial candidates on the issue 
of higher education,” Jung said. “It’s 
going beyond just the regents and 
really focusing on the state, where 
the power to change is going to be.”

As of Sunday evening, e-mails 
sent out by the Coalition to Save 
Our Futures — the student organi-
zation  coordinating UCSD’s leg of 
the trip — still contained the wrong 
date on which the regents would 
begin voting.

In May 2009, the regents 
approved a 10-percent system-
wide Education Fee increase and 
a 4.2-percent Registration Fee 
increase, which went into effect by 
Summer Session I. The Regents also 
approved an additional 10-percent 
increase in nonresident tuition for 
undergraduate students, which took 
effect this quarter.

On Nov. 18, the regents are 
expected to approve a midyear fee 
increase of roughly 15 percent for 
both UC undergraduate and gradu-

ate professional students — along 
with a 2.6 percent increase for grad-
uate academic students — effective 
Winter Quarter 2010, along with 
another systemwide fee increase of 
roughly 15 percent, effective sum-
mer 2010 for all students. 

Alongside the fee increases, the 
regents will consider an expansion 
of the Blue and Gold Opportunity 
Plan, which would grant about 800 
more students full financial-aid 
coverage. The program current-
ly covers the systemwide fees of 
California resident students with 
family incomes of under $60,000. 
The latest proposal, initiated by UC 
President Mark G. Yudof, would 
raise the income ceiling to $70,000.

fHowever, Jung said the finan-
cial-aid proposal is designed pri-
marily to ease student concerns 
about the fee increases.

“They always come out with a 
plan like that when they raise fees 
to appease public opinion,” he said.

Eleanor Roosevelt College fresh-
man Tuhina Srivastava said she 
agrees with Jung, claiming that the 
program’s expansion will not make 
up for the fee increases.

“The Blue and Gold Opportunity 
Plan is a lofty and noble goal, but 
it’s just not conducive to the current 
UC budget crisis,” Srivastava said 
in an e-mail.  “In conjunction with 
the midyear fee increases, the plan 
doesn’t directly mitigate the impact 
of the budget deficit.  Instead, it 
just seems to reapportion funds, 
not actually solving any problems 
and certainly not making much dif-
ference compared to the imminent 
32-percent fee increase.”

New Health 
Center to Focus 
on Migration
public-health specialists and medi-
cal practitioners, we can respond 
more effectively to the health-care 
needs of California’s immigrant and 
refugee populations, and help poli-
cymakers anticipate future needs for 
health care in these communities,” 
Cornelius said.

The Global Health Institute runs 
two other programs in addition 
to UCSD’s Migration Center. One 
Health: Water, Animals, Food and 
Safety — led by UC Riverside and UC 
Davis — encompasses ecology, envi-
ronmental health, veterinary medi-
cine and agriculture. Women’s Health 
and Empowerment is led by UC San 
Francisco and UCLA. 

The institute’s first educational 
track will be a one-year master’s 
program in global health, followed 
by two-year master’s and doctoral 
programs. Rather than being offered 
at a specific university or center of 
expertise, this  graduate program 
will be available to students at any 
UC campus.

“We also anticipate that a num-
ber of schools will be launching new 
certificate programs and under-
graduate minors focused on spe-
cific areas of expertise that revolve 
around the centers of expertise,” 
COEMH co-director Steffanie 
Strathdee said.

The chief source of funding for 
the Global Health Institute is the 
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, 
which provided $4 million in startup 
funds for the program.

“We’ve been broadcasting online for a number of years, and 
we’re pretty happy with that,” said Wong. “It suits us pretty well. 
But to expand as a student service, we really want to get an FM 
signal. A lot of it is about making the KSDT station more of 
an integral part of the community, and to be here more for the 
UCSD community as a whole.”

Since KSDT’s launch at UCSD as an AM radio station in June 
1968, acquiring an FM frequency has been a consistent — yet elu-
sive — goal for the rotating deejay lineup.

Just don’t ask any of the station’s current members about its 
history.

“One of the things about KSDT is that since we’re students, we 
have a horrible collective memory,” said Wong. “Every four years, 
it gets completely erased.”

Kenworthy said he thinks it’s more like two.
As a result of the university’s revolving door, the institutional 

memory passed down to KSDT’s current generation is a distorted 
one, built upon myth and misunderstanding.

SELECTIVE MEMORY
If you ask Kenworthy, Wong, or any other current/recent 

KSDT staff member, they’ll tell you the station used to have its 
own FM frequency. Supposedly, KSDT lost its signal in 1999, 
when the A.S. Council cut the organization’s funding after it vio-
lated the drug and alcohol policy. Because of this loss, the station 
had to sell its radio tower, which used to be located where the 
Price Center ATMs currently reside.

But this is just one theory. According to Wong, there is an 
entire rumor mill of alternative accounts.

In truth, KSDT was never its own FM station. No record exists 
— in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) archives 
or elsewhere — of KSDT ever being broadcast over a radio tower 
or terrestrial FM signal. 

One look at the archived pages of KSDT’s own Web site 
(accessed via the WayBackMachine — a nonprofit virtual library 
that saves old versions of Web sites), and it’s apparent the radio 
station has long felt the difficulty of achieving long-term goals in 
a four-year university setting. 

According to these accounts, KSDT originated in 1967 in 
a Pacific Beach garage, where a group of students broadcast 
tunes using a low-power signal. With the help of then-Assistant 
Dean of Student Affairs Robert Topolovac, KSDT founders Don 

Bright and Jon Collins were awarded funding to establish a col-
lege radio station on UCSD.

News of its creation ran in the founding issue of the 
Guardian’s predecessor, the Triton Times, on May 26, 1967, 
announcing plans to wire student programming into the Revelle 
College dorms — the only on-campus housing in existence at the 
time.

In 1968, KSDT set up on-campus shop in an old military 
building made out of corrugated steel. The station used the uni-
versity’s electrical system to broadcast on 540 AM over a sketchy 
carrier current — a low-power method that didn’t require an FCC 
license because of its limited reach. 

Maybe rumors of KSDT having its own terrestrial FM station 
stemmed from the fact it was broadcast over cable radio: For a 
time, the station did make it onto cable FM 95.7. (Cable radio 
transmits a signal through electrical wires, but does not require 
FCC licensing or a radio tower.)

 
GROWING PAINS

Four years after going live, KSDT made its first attempt at 
securing an FM signal in 1972. The station applied for a per-
mit from the FCC that would allow it to build a radio tower to 
broadcast as an FM Noncommercial Educational (NCE) entity. 
However, the request was denied due to engineering concerns 
about the tower’s proposed site.

The next attempt was made in 1974, when KSDT filed a peti-
tion with the FCC that challenged commercial station KDIG 
— 98.1 FM — for its broadcasting license for. The petition main-
tained that KDIG (now KIFM) failed to comply with its public-
service responsibilities. If approved, KSDT could have applied to 
take over the 98.1 FM frequency.

Attempts to hijack 98.1 FM continued over the years, with 

1967 1968 1972 1974 1975 1987 1988 1996 1996 1999 1999 2000 2000 2001 2002 2003 2005 2006 2007 2009 2010

FRIDAY MISSION VALLEY

OPINION� MONDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2009� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 9 

A WEEK IN FARMERS MARKETS

SITESEEN

With a year-round 70-degree climate on our side, there’s no excuse not to visit one of San Diego county’s weekly outdoor 
markets. They go beyond kettle corn and crepe stands; you’ll find quality produce sold by California farmers. What’s more, 
there’s one every day of the week (except for Mondays). Don’t forget your reusable totes and, of course, an empty stomach.

SUNDAY

O vertaking central San Diego on Fridays, Mission Valley’s farmers market is stocked with over 85 booths to satisfy any ethnic craving — including an Egyptian-iced tea stand, a 
Peruvian chocolate shack and a craftsman selling wooden African 
bracelets. 

If you’re feeling a little daring, you might consider sinking your 
teeth into a hot balut from the Ramona Duck Farm — the same 
boiled duck embryo (a popular snack from the Philippines) that 
was once featured on “Fear Factor.” 

The market’s greatest perk is abundant nearby parking. It’s 
located in the East Westfield parking lot near Macy’s, where a 
20-minute drive from campus yields hundreds of empty spots 
(something no from UCSD would know anything about). Mission 
Valley’s market is also situated conveniently close to Ikea, in case 
you’re burdened with the more corporate craving for a dirt-cheap, 
mass-produced shoe rack.

E ven though there’s a farmers market elsewhere in downtown La Jolla on Sunday mornings, Hillcrest’s weekly street fair is a refreshing change of scenery. With over 100 stalls of farm-fresh organic fruits and veggies, crafts sold by local artisans and a diverse spread of drool-worthy goodies, and a live bluegrass band, its variety is 
unmatched in San Diego. Plus, most of the midweekers flock to Normal Street on Sundays, so if you missed the heir-
loom guy on Thursday, you can catch him — and a fleet of his competitors — in the lively Hillcrest venue.

Of course, popularity has its downfalls: The Sunday market is almost always overcrowded, the prices for some 
products aren’t much different from those you’d find in a grocery store and parking is a mess. 

If possible, arrive near opening or closing. If you show up early, you up your chances of finding a nearby parking 
spot in the congested neighborhood, and you get first pick of the freshest produce (not that there’s a dearth). At the 
end of the day, parking loosens up again, and many vendors slash their prices in the half-hour before closing — so 
drag yourself out of bed at 8 a.m. or stick around ’til 2 p.m. for the best shopping experience. 

The Hillcrest market also boasts a sizable selection of nonedible fare. You’ll find vintage costume jewelry, winter 
scarves, a replacement for your funky-odored book bag and a variety of flowers to bring home to wifey.

Just like the produce, prepared food is plentiful. Expect farmers-market usuals — meats on sticks, meats wrapped 
in some sort of carb, imported cheeses — and some unusuals — coconut pancakes, raw vegan meals that actually 
taste good, fresh ceviche and fresh pasta — not the dried supermarket stuff. 

But before you line up for a squash-blossom tamale, work the aisles for some free samples: sweet stone fruits, 
sticky persimmons, ripe guavas, homemade salsa, crusty bread and whatever else you can find. After thirty minutes 
of smiling politely and stuffing your face you’ll probably be good ’til dinner time.

H ome to the newest farmers market in San Diego — hitting the streets a few months before Fall Quarter — Mira Mesa has quickly become a boomtown for booth fare. Hidden behind Mira Mesa High School at the parking lot’s east end, it’s not hard to see why business is swelling: The 
market’s a refuge for families itching to escape another Tuesday afternoon cooped up in their tract homes.

But as long as you don’t have a strong hatred for children, the market is worth a visit if only for its prime people-watching.
Aside from the usual assortment of produce and pastries, Mira Mesa’s biggest draws are its crafts and ethnic cuisine. Where 

else would you find hand-knitted sweaters and freshly baked samosas rubbing shoulders (besides the Jo-Ann’s in Mumbai)?
Funnel cakes, cups of chopped fruit and all that other stuff you’d find at other markets are surefire staples at this lot. But, 

unlike the San Diego Fair, prices aren’t inflated. 
Call up a couple friends living in the area if you decide to make a trip out to Mira Mesa — they can help you haggle over the 

tub of hummus.

U p the coast from Torrey Pines State Reserve, Del Mar’s seaside stretch of ocean-view properties makes a clutch backdrop for some leisurely grocery shopping after making the most of midday swells.
And if you’re not a surfer, then hopefully you at least like the beach — because 

the Del Mar farmers market isn’t worth the drive unless you’re killing two birds 
with one stone. 

The shoreside market’s hands-down best feature is its flood of seafood. On 
the right side of the market among various other food stands are rows of clams 
welded shut, raw shrimp, thick strips of mackerel, swordfish and red snapper.

Aside from fresh ocean goods, the market also hosts a load of adorable snacks 
(such as gourmet chocolates from Belgium, homemade jams or toffee brittle), 
wholesale groceries, imported pasta and hand-twisted baked goods.

Still, with a total of about 15 stands divided between two adjacent parking lots, 
the Del Mar market probably won’t tempt you to stay longer than 20 minutes. 
So if you decide to make the commute or take the 30-minute bus ride, convince 
a couple friends to kick it with you at the beach before cruising back down the 
coast of billionaires.

HILLCREST

KEVIN WU/GUARDIAN
With over 100 stalls skirting the curbside, Hillcrest boasts San Diego’s largest farmers market.

TUESDAY MIRA MESA THURSDAY NORTH PARK

C ompared to larger weekend bazaars, North Park’s mellow market is quaint and quiet, fea-turing a modest 25 stands — but at least it’s not 
crowded. Goods are typical of a midweek market 
(organic eats, fresh flowers, etc.), relatively limited 
in selection — and, of the other Thursday offerings, 
North Park is our closest market to campus.

If you’re looking for produce, expect to encoun-
ter more fruit than vegetables, some organics and 
salad-fixing basics like lettuce, avocados, tomatoes 
and peppers. Don’t expect to stumble upon the fresh 
morel mushrooms you’ll need for that recipe, but 
you might find a sweet trinket from the guy hawking 
heirlooms. Apples and peaches will soon be out of 
season, so stock up — and the North Park market’s 
yam and corn crops are just now at their height.

As a little extra motivation, the market also has 
those strawberry-stuffed, whipped cream-smothered 
crepes you’ve been craving all week. Like the pro-
duce, all premade meals are standard farmers market 
fare: honey and bread, hummus and street tacos, to 
name a few. You’ll also find customary chrysanthe-
mum bouquets, sterling silver jewelry and tie-dyed 
handbags.

Leave your car on the street or skip the pay stand 
if you park in the CVS parking lot — you (most 
likely) won’t get ticketed. And definitely hit up the 
sambussa stand for some deep-fried dough triangles 
stuffed with spiced lentils, steaming beef or coconut 
cream cheese.

WEDNESDAY OCEAN BEACH

B right booths line Newport Avenue every Wednesday afternoon for the Ocean Beach farmers market, a tradition since 1991. This is no ordinary street fair — not surprising, considering the laid-back, sleepy sub-community in which it resides. The market’s vendors tend to cater to the beach hippie type, offering everything from ginger juices and feathered jew-
elry to delicious all-natural grub like curry and freshly-baked cookies. 

Along the rows of art stands lie plenty of brightly colored, swirly paintings perfect for your inner stoner. 
Or maybe you’ll want a water-filled glass ornament to spin gracefully in front of your window, propping a delicate 

flower toward the sun. You might even just want to join the fun with a small blanket you brought from home, and stake 
out curbside. 

Most sidewalk squatters look like they just crawled out of an attic and scattered their findings in front of you — none of 
which have fixed prices. So bargain away, young college student — bargain away.

All in all, Ocean Beach is a microworld of the liberal, relaxed on the sidelines of a fast-paced city with savory snacks and 
acoustic improv that’s definitely worth the short trek south.

10 THE UCSD GUARDIAN� MONDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2009� FOCUS

interest fluctuating as staff and man-
agement rotated through the deejay 
booth. According to KSDT’s archived 
history, in 1982, UC attorneys advised 
the station that such a petition would 
likely be denied — and the station 
finally dropped all efforts to pursue the 
procurement of 98.1 FM. 

The thrust to obtain an FM signal 
surfaced again in 1988, when UCSD 
struck an agreement with the Gannet 
Co., Inc. — a media company that 
owned local radio station KSDO, 
broadcasting on 1160 AM and 102.9 
FM. According to an article published 
in the Los Angeles Times on March 3, 
1988, UCSD leased space on its power-
ful Mt. Soledad transmitter tower for 
KSDO to strengthen its signal in the 
North County region.

In exchange, KSDO agreed to pay 
UCSD $18,000 a year, provide student 
internships and set aside an hour-long 
slot for UCSD programming on its sta-
tions. And most importantly, KSDO 
pledged to help guide UCSD in the 
thorny process of obtaining an FM 
radio signal.

However, communications pro-
fessor Robert Horowitz is quoted as 
saying, “I’m not real optimistic. The 
real question is whether Gannett can 
convince the State Department to talk 
to Mexico about our getting an unused 
frequency that is now allocated for 
Mexico.”

Today, the University of California 
continues to offer internships through 
the Gannet Co., Inc., and 102.9 FM — 
now KJQY — still broadcasts from Mt. 
Soledad.

But UCSD never got it’s FM radio 
station.

The barriers to establishing an FM 
station had a lot to do with San Diego’s 
proximity to Mexico: In addition to 
the horde of commercial radio stations 
already established on this side of the 
border, KSDT would have had to com-
pete with stations transmitting from 
Mexico, ones with much less stringent 

airspace-protection restrictions.
Clearly, changing foreign policy for 

our college station to score an FM sig-
nal was beyond the scope of the deal. 
After the 1996 Telecommunications 
Act, the San Diego market became 
saturated with powerful media con-
glomerates, further halting KSDT’s 
FM-radio aspirations.

STARTING OVER
In 1999, the KSDT Web site 

underwent an overhaul. Its section 
on “Why KSDT Can’t Be Picked Up 
On a Normal FM Radio” — as well as 
its historical section — disappeared, 
and with the eventual graduation of 
its signal-craving staff members, the 
station’s collective memory faded into 
the virtual ether, preserved only in the 
neglected corners of the Web.

Of course, there might just be a 
hard copy floating around somewhere 
in the cluttered station headquarters.

“We can probably find [the sta-
tion’s history] in our records,” said 
Wong. “We have a filing cabinet full of 
archives from KSDT, but some of it is 
like — at this period of time, they put 
all their meeting notes in and all their 
deejay attendance. But then some of it 
is like coloring-book pages. And one 
of the drawers we can’t open. It’s like, 
wedged shut.”

Despite a slight memory loss, the 
new millennium has brought a new 
FCC policy that may restore KSDT’s 
prospects for landing a channel.

In January 2000, the FCC estab-
lished an option for smaller stations to 
broadcast over Low Power FM radio 
(LPFM), which uses less than 100 watts 
of power and provides a 3.5-mile radi-
us service range — ideal for reaching a 
tight-knit campus community.

KSDT jumped at the new broad-
casting option, applying for LPFM on 
June 2 of that year.

According to minutes from a 
September 13, 2000 meeting of the UC 
Regents Committee on Finance, the 
establishment of a LPFM station had 

the support of then-UCSD Chancellor 
Robert Dynes and was to be fully 
funded by the A.S. Council. Equipment 
and construction expenses were esti-
mated to cost anywhere from $20,000 
to $25,000, with operating costs after 

obtaining 
an FM sig-
nal slated at 
$50,000 per 
year.

But — like 
all grasps at 
an airwave in 
KSDT’s past 
— the LPFM 
attempt was 
eventually 
foiled. In the 
summer 2001 
issue of local 
newsletter 
Rouge Forum, 
former 
KSDT staff 
member and 
2006 gradu-
ate Michel 
Cazary wrote 
that the FCC 
application 
was denied 
because the 
station was 
located in an 
urban area 

surrounded by commercial stations.
Unfortunately for KSDT, the Radio 

Broadcasting Preservation Act had 
been established by December 2000 to 
protect existing broadcasting interests 
by making the requirements for estab-
lishing LPFM stations more stringent.

THE NEXT EPISODE
Once again, KSDT has plans to 

build an FM radio tower. But this 
time, the station might actually stand 
a chance.

In 2003, independent entity the 
Mitre Corporation released a study 
concluding that LPFM signals cause no 

significant interference to full-power 
stations like 91.1 FM or 93.3 FM — 
good news for a rotating college crew 
with longtime FM aspirations.

As a result, the Local Community 
Radio Act has been introduced into 
Congress several times with the goal 
of lifting restrictions on LPFM station 
licensing. Its 2009 form — H.R. 1147 — 
is currently awaiting a vote. If passed, 
would nullify the grounds on which 
KSDT’s 2000 application was denied.

Also different this time around 
is KSDT’s partnership with the 
Intercollegiate Broadcasting System, 
Inc. — an organization devoted to 
assisting colleges and universities 
establish their own radio stations. 
According to Marshall College senior 
and KSDT’s self-proclaimed “exec at 
large” Marcus Rosario, the IBS would 
provide much-needed technical and 
legal advising services to the station.

The next chance for current KSDT 
staffers to submit an application to 
the FCC is Feb. 19 through Feb. 26, 
2010. If approved, the station would 
receive a construction permit to build 
a LPFM radio tower to broadcast as a 
Noncommercial Educational station.

But with 50 pages of technical jar-
gon to muddle through, filling out this 
application is no simple task. 

“It’s basically a huge, fatty-looking 
tax document,” Rosario said.

Part of the application process is 
determining whether any FM frequen-
cies in the Noncommercial Educational 
range (88.0 FM through 99.1 FM) 
are even available. Rosario claims he 
has identified at least three open fre-
quencies that are currently owned by 
religious organizations but don’t offer 
programming — which means they 
could be open for the taking.

Associate Vice President of Student 
Services Meredith Madnick is also 
involved in the search for a potential 
KSDT home on the airwaves. Madnick 
said she will be hiring an engineering 
consultant — probably from within the 
UCSD community — and has already 

approached Academic Computing and 
Media Services for consultation.

KSDT would also be required to 
find a location for the proposed radio 
tower. One option, Madnick said, is 
to construct the tower in Tijuana and 
broadcast to La Jolla from there — a 
common San Diego radio practice. 
Scan the stations at midnight, and 
you’ll be able to identify which ones 
transmit from across the border — 
just listen for the mandatory Mexican 
national anthem.

A more likely case would be to find 
a location at UCSD, but according to 
Wong, campus land is in high demand.

If the application is approved and 
the construction permit granted, the 
real work will likely begin. According 
to Rosario, KSDT would have only 
18 months to erect a tower, update its 
equipment, hire the necessary person-
nel and renovate its space. Costs for 
such changes could range anywhere 
from $10,000 to $25,000.

Lucky for KSDT, the A.S. Council 
is on board with the station’s plans and 
willing to draw from its reserves to foot 
the bill.

“This wouldn’t take away from any 
other services or orgs,” Madnick said. 
“[The funding] would be taken from 
the mandate reserves.”

Despite the stacks of legal papers 
and potential headaches, KSDT and 
A.S. Council have expressed a determi-
nation to see the project through.

“We’d model ourselves after pub-
lic radio like NPR or KCRW in LA,” 
Rosario said. “They have a strict for-
mat, but they still play music that isn’t 
found elsewhere, they still have special-
interest programming, they still have 
public news segments. I figure we’d 
have more news programs that cater to 
the campus as well as the greater San 
Diego area — and even sports, in addi-
tion to music. It would be definitely 
way more campus-based radio.”

PART 3 It was Spring Break at Daytona 
Beach.  I was lying on the beach, enjoying the 

sun’s rays and a happy buzz from some brew.  I 
was 20 years old, a junior at Davidson College in 

North Carolina.  A song by “The Turtles” came on the 
radio, and I laughed with joy as they crooned their tune:  “So 
happy together, how is the weather…”.  For some reason those 
words struck me funny.  “So happy together”, seemingly sincere 
words to one genuinely cared about.  Then, “how is the 
weather?”, which sounds so trite and shallow.  I laughed because 
the two swings, from apparent sincerity and depth to 
superficiality and triviality, typified my life.  I was living life like it 
was an absurd silly game, drinking and partying, living the wild 
life, no purpose, no goals.  I wasn’t a Wild Life major 
academically, but certainly was socially.  Suddenly, as I listened 
to the music, my mood changed dramatically, from 
contentedness with the meaninglessness of my life, to alarm 
about the same.  It was an awakening of sorts that set me on a 
quest.  I made a decision that day on the beach: “There must be 
a meaning to life, and I intend to find it.”  

The words of Jesus came to my mind, “I am the Light of the 
world.  Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will 
have the light of life” (John 8:12 NIV).  Those words greatly 
intrigued me.  Was Jesus crazy, delusional?  Was He a legend 
created by overzealous followers?  Or was He God in flesh, Truth 
incarnate, grounded in a Truth I had never experienced before?  
Back at college, I signed up for a course the next semester 
entitled, The Life and Ministry of Jesus, taught by an agnostic.  
As I read the books and the gospels, I became utterly amazed at 
the Person of Jesus.  Although at that time I did not believe in the 
reported miracles or in His resurrection from the dead, still I was 
drawn to Him as the most intriguing and amazing person I had 
ever known about.  His power, His authority – never used for His 
own benefit; His love and identification with the least, the last, 
the lost, the lonely, the “losers”;  His authenticity, genuineness, 
confidence in who He was and what His life was about; His 
teachings, His heart, His passion.  The more I read, the more 
excited I became.  “Jesus is amazing…Jesus is AMAZING!!!”   I 
became obsessed, in a positive and exciting sense, in my quest 
to learn all I could about Him.  I felt like a man in the desert, 
looking for water –and I could see what looked like a wonderful 
oasis.  But could it be a mirage?  I had to know – “Is Jesus Christ 
a mirage, or is He the REAL THING?  

It was three days into Christmas break my senior year at college.  
I had stayed over to work on a paper about Jesus.  I remember 
reading something like this in one book: “Jesus wasn’t saying to 
believe this creed or that set of ethics.  He was saying, ‘Give me 
your life!  Follow me, Either – Or, Yes or No, paint or get off the 
ladder!’”   My heart responded and I poured out all my pent up 
feelings and thoughts.  “Yes! Yes, Jesus – I want to follow You, I 
want to be like You.  You are my Hero…  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!”   At that 
point an amazing thing happened, something that completely 
changed my life.  A veil in the spiritual realm was lifted, and God’s 
love powerfully engulfed me.  I felt an incredible sense that I was 
known and cared for by an infinite, personal Spiritual Being.  
“God is!  Life matters!  It has meaning!  There is a purpose for 
my life!”  I wept on and off for days.  Jesus revealed Himself to 
me, personally -- to my heart, my mind, and my spirit.

I believe that if God did that for me, He will do that for you.  If 
He loves me, He loves you.  If He created me and has a purpose 
for my life, He created you and has a purpose for your life.  Some 
believe we can create our own reality, at least in the spiritual 
realm, and that all our ideas and beliefs are equally valid.  But 
God either exists or He doesn’t, regardless of what you or I 
believe about it.  Let me close with a question to you:  If God 
exists, and if He reveals Himself to you in a way that is 
unmistakable to you, are you willing to accept Him?  If Jesus 
Christ is God incarnate, the hope of the world, do you want to 
know it and will you follow Him?

be installed), podcasted lectures 
include a corresponding video of a 
professor’s PowerPoints.

When UCSD launched its podcast 
program in Fall Quarter 2007, only 42 
classes participated, and since then, 
that figure has more than doubled to 
94. Though the initial installation of 
recording equipment, 
microphones and cam-
eras was quite pricey 
(as much as $1,500 per 
room), once the technol-
ogy was set up, it became 
invaluable to over-sleep-
ing and double-booked 
students alike.

In large classes where 
the objective is to sit qui-
etly, notebook in hand, 
and be lectured like a 
good student, podcasts 
provide the same mini-
mal intimacy as showing 
up. Additionally, with the 
mere clip of a microphone to a collar, 
we can have access to a perfect record 
of lectures throughout the quarter.

Smaller classes, however, exist 
chiefly for discussion and exchange; in 
those few environments where we get 
face-to-face time with professors and 
fellow students, a podcast can’t substi-
tute the real thing. For this reason, the 
recording of lectures hasn’t taken off 
with everybody. Oceanography pro-
fessor Nicholas Holland pledges to the 
idea of “teaching naked” — giving lec-
tures without technological aids such 
as PowerPoints and, yes, podcasts. 

Holland argues that, when offered 
a glossy presentation, students tend 
to zone out and pay no more atten-
tion than if they were watching the 
local news. Instead, Holland favors 
a more organic approach, choosing 
to bring in glass baking pans and fill 
them with jellyfish and brittle stars, 
to be projected up front for all to see. 
Eye-catchers like these, he says, will 
force students sit up and take notice 

— something that can’t be captured 
on a podcast.

To an extent, he’s right. But a 
two-hour lecture on the gastrointes-
tinal tract doesn’t lend itself to flashy 
demonstrations quite as well as the 
crustaceans and copepods of marine 
science. Showstopping lectures like 
Holland’s are few and far between.

Most podcast-resist-
ing professors, accord-
ing to Instructional Web 
Development Center 
Manager Christine 
Bagwell, fear students 
don’t get the same expe-
rience from podcasts 
as they would from 
live lectures. To begin, 
Bagwell said, they 
lose the opportunity 
to interact with their 
teachers. Professors are 
also concerned that 
students might be more 
inclined to skip class if 

they think they can just listen in later 
on, andcould miss out on important 
lecture materials, as podcasts shut 
off when movies are played to avoid 
copyright issues.

But let’s be realistic. Students typi-
cally save more intimate questions 
for TA sections, and the moment 
a lecture hall’s lights go out and a 
movie comes on, half the class takes a 
15-minute reprieve for a little shuteye 
anyway. 

A study released in October by the 
Educause Center for Applied Research 
showed that whether a student attend-
ed class had little to do with whether 
or not it was podcasted. Of students 
polled, 64.7 percent strongly disagreed 
that they would be more likely to cut 
class if podcasts were made available. 
Instead, the attendance (surprise, 
surprise) depended on whether or not 
the lecturer was interesting, as did the 
number of podcast downloads. 

Sure, in a close-knit class where 
20 students are using their personal 

experience as a reference point for 
discussing the conflict between first-
and second-generation immigrants, 
the learning experience is entirely 
dependent being there in person. 
Whether or not this is a good thing 
is debatable (such classroom freedom 
often breeds awkward silences when 
no one is very inclined to speak up), 
but it’s not an environment a podcast 
can recreate.

In lecture halls, however, it’s no 
wonder half the class doesn’t show up 
until the final. We might as well not 
be there. The lecturer has his or her 
own agenda to rush through in 50 
minutes, so even if we do decide to 
ask a question, our desperately waving 
hand may go ignored way up in the 
nosebleed section.

There are advantages to “teaching 
naked,” to be sure, like the more per-
sonal touch that comes from replacing 
typed PowerPoints with hand-drawn 
chalkboard diagrams. But when it 
comes down to last-minute studying 
for that international business mid-
term, frantically double-checking our 
notes on the linguistic genocide in 
20th-century Spain would be far less 
stressful if the professor’s comments 
were audible at the click of a button.

on the clock, UCSD received its third 
corner kick of the night. 

After freshman defender Hayley 
Johnson failed to find net off the set 
piece, McTigue collected the loose ball 
and fired a hard shot to the right of 
the keeper, giving her team a one-goal 
lead that would hold for the remainder 
of the match. 

Johnson picked up her fourth assist 
of the season on the game-winning 
play, while McTigue scored her eighth 
goal of the season and saw her first 
career multi-goal game. 

McManus — while grateful for 
McTigue’s strong effort — was not 
surprised by her performance.

“She’s been like that all year,” 
McManus said. “She’s only a sopho-
more, but she’s playing like a senior. 
She’s leading the team up front by 
example.”

UCSD finished with a 17-10 
shot advantage, though the Wildcats 
notched five shots on goal to the 

Tritons’ two. Chico State also had 
a 4-3 edge in corner kicks, though 
they proved fruitless in the face of the 
Triton win.

“We were really pumped up for 
the game,” McTigue said. “We came at 
them hard from the beginning, and we 
kept the pressure on them the whole 
time and ran them over. “

According to McManus, despite 
compiling a 15-5-1 record on the 2009 
season, the team’s youth and inex-
perience has been its most consis-
tent obstacle to playoff success. With 
Saturday’s thrilling win, the team put 
many of those worries to rest.

“In playoffs, the veteran teams — 
the experienced teams — are the ones 
that step up and win it,” McManus 
said. “We definitely got off to a good 
start, so it’s a little confidence boost-
er for us to realize that our youth 
doesn’t matter anymore. We were 
young at the beginning of the season, 
but when you play 20-odd games 
together, they’re not a young team 
anymore. They’ve gotten to know 
each other, their habits, their runs 
and what certain people do.”

entire first set despite a strong 
defensive effort from the Seawolves 
— who stayed within a 
few points of their host. 

After Sonoma pulled 
within one point late in 
the match, UCSD called 
a timeout and came 
back firing, riding on 
two straight kills from 
Schmidt — who also 
nailed the set-winning 
kill — to give the Tritons 
a 25-19 victory.

In the second set, the 
Tritons stormed to an 
early lead. Schmidt sent 
down five kills, resulting 
in a quick 6-1 advantage. 
The Seawolves fought 
back to tie the set 8-8, 
but the Tritons recovered 
on a pair of Sonoma State errors. 

One set away from victory, 

UCSD’s win didn’t come easily, as 
Sonoma slowed the Triton attack 
with a resilient defense. 

With the score at 
24-22, Schmidt put away 
the game’s final point 
with another clinching 
kill.

The Tritons ran into 
the weekend’s most seri-
ous challenge in the 
third set against the 
Seawolves, which saw 
eight ties and four lead 
changes. 

The Tritons took a 
commanding lead half-
way through the set, 
but the Seawolf block-
ers were able to close 
the Tritons hitting lanes, 
staging a late comeback 
to pull within one point. 

Though the Tritons were not 
quite able to put the game away 

offensively, their defense stepped 
up to close the match 25-23 with a 
set of blocks from Chen and red-
shirt freshman middle blocker Julia 
Freidenberg.

The Tritons learned late Sunday 
night that they will face San 
Francisco State on Nov. 19 in the 
first round of the NCAA Western 
Regionals. UCSD swept San 
Francisco on Oct. 3 but dropped a 
four-set decision to the Gators on 
Nov. 6 — only their second loss of 
the 2009 season. Along with host 
Cal State San Bernardino, the 2009 
West Regionals will feature Sonoma 
State, Cal State LA and the  univer-
sity of Alaska Anchorage.

“Preparation is the same as 
always: just get back into the game 
and work on what we need to work 
on,” Black said.

Prior to their Nov. 14 game against Humboldt State at RIMAC Arena, UCSD honored four departing Tritons — Sylvia Schmidt, Elaine Chen, Lauren Bradley 
and Karen Reis — at the annual senior night. UCSD won the game in three straight sets to wrap up the 2009 regular season with a 28-2 record (20-2 CCAA). 

more victories.”
On the men’s side, UCSD was 

looking to avenge a loss at last year’s 
meet. The Tritons crushed Detroit 
Mercy 24-3, but — just like last year 
— fell 16-11 to the No. 9 Stanford 
Cardinal.

Rojales said she was pleased with 
both her individual effort and the 
team’s overall performance at the 
meet. 

“This tournament was a great 
bonding time as a team,” Rojales 
said. “Playing against these schools 
inspires me to improve myself so 

that I can really step it up in the next 
tournament.

UCSD looks to continue its ear-
ly-season improvements at a home 
meet against Cal Tech and UC Irvine 
on Nov. 24.

“We will just focus harder,” 
Runyan said. “This was our first 
tough challenge of the season for 
our team as a whole. In the winter 
we have some good competitions 
lined up to prepare us to close out 
the season well.”

WOMEN’S SOCCER — The UCSD wom-
en’s soccer team defeated Chico State in 
a dramatic 2-1 win on Nov. 14, emerging 
victorious from the second round of the 
NCAA Division-II tournament. The vic-
tory advanced the Tritons to the third 
round, setting them up for a Nov. 20 match 
against Cal State Dominguez Hills after the 
Toros defeated Cal State LA 2-1 on Nov. 15 
to secure a third-round birth.

As the No. 2 seed in the West Regional, 
UCSD earned a first-round bye and hosted 
the Chico State Wildcats. 

Chico State, fresh off a penalty-kick 
shootout victory against defending nation-
al champion Seattle Pacific University on 
Nov. 12, stepped into the Triton Soccer 
Stadium looking to walk out with another 
win. Though the Wildcats entered the 
game riding a huge wave of momentum, 
UCSD — having lost each of its past three 
matches — walked onto the pitch with a 
do-or-die mentality.

“Sometimes you would like to get away 
on the road and just concentrate on the 
game,” head coach Brian McManus said. 

“Playing at home with all the distractions 
could have affected a young team like this. 
Yet they prepared properly this week. The 
practices have been great, and the intensity 
has been great.”

It was a tough contest from the first to 
the final whistle — each team played hard-
er and got more physical as the game pro-
gressed. Despite a fast start by the Tritons, 
the Wildcats struck first, taking a 1-0 lead 
on a corner kick in the 23rd minute.

The Tritons responded quickly to tie 
the game. After receiving a pass from the 
right by freshman midfielder Jessica Wi 
in the 25th minute, sophomore forward 
Sarah McTigue sent a high shot past the 
Wildcat keeper to the upper left of the net, 
tying the match at 1-1. It was Wi’s seventh 
assist and McTigue’s seventh goal of the 
season.

“That was big,” McManus said. “If it 
went to halftime 0-1, that would have 
given them such a lift. But coming back 
and getting a goal that quick, I think that 
brought their heads down a bit.” 

After the UCSD equalizer, the match 
remained at a 1-1 stalemate through half-
time. As overtime inched closer, the two

FENCING — UCSD’s first important 
road meet of the 2009 season ended 
on a positive note after the team went 
up against tough Division-I oppo-
nents on Nov. 14 at the NCAA West 
Invitational. Held in Palo Alto, Calif., 
the meet pitted the Tritons against 
Stanford University, Northwestern 
University and the University of 
Detroit Mercy. 

The meet turned out good results 
for the Tritons, with both the men’s 
and women’s squads rallying up points 
that will weigh heavily on rankings 
for the NCAA Championships next 
Spring. 

Looking to build off of last sea-
son’s 17th-place finish at the NCAA 
National Championships, the 2009 
Tritons went into the meet with a 
positive outlook.

“We were fencing some pretty 
tough competitors, but we have great 
team spirit and a lot of talented people 
on our team,” sophomore epee fencer 
Casey Gillcrist said.

Repeating their performance  at the 
NCAA Invitational last fall, the wom-
en’s team defeated host Stanford with 
a 16-11 overall finish. Contributing to 
the win were senior foil fencers Alicia 
Trigeiro and Gillcrist, who each won 
two out of three bouts in their events, 
sabre and epee fencing, respectively. 

“We showed that, as representa-
tives of UCSD, we can put up a good 
fight against any team,” senior sabre 
fencer Samantha Rojales said. 

Along with a narrow victory over 
Stanford, the Triton women also 
picked up a commanding 25-2 win 
over Detroit Mercy. UCSD was not 
able to finalize a sweep of the women’s 
competition, however, falling 23-4 to 
the No. 6 Northwestern University. 

“Our match against the 
Northwestern women was disappoint-
ing,” head coach Heidi Runyan said. 
“They are a great team, but we were 
flat. We should have pulled off a few

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — In the final 
weekend of the 2009 regular season, the 
Tritons swept a pair of victories and saw 
their team captain — senior outside hitter 
Sylvia Schmidt — break UCSD’s all-time 
single-season kills record before throngs of 
fans on senior night on Nov. 14. 

UCSD took down No. 18 Sonoma State 
on Nov. 13 before defeating the Humboldt 
State Lumberjacks in straight sets the fol-
lowing night. With a match-high 16 kills, 
Schmidt brought her season total to 447, 
surpassing a record of 439 set by Bonnie 
Wilson during the 2004 season. 

Before the match on senior night, the 
Tritons honored Schmidt, setter Elaine 
Chen and outside hitters Karen Reis and 
Lauren Bradley — who together notched a 
combined 38 kills to sweep Humboldt State.

The win marked the last regular-season 
game for the Tritons before playoffs get 
underway on Nov. 19.

“That’s the joy of coaching,” head coach 
Tom Black said. “You only get four years 
with these girls, and there are a lot of great 
moments, a lot of really hard moments, but 
in the end it’s definitely worth it.”

During the first set against the Sonoma 
State Seawolves, the Tritons were in control 
from the beginning — and never let go. 
UCSD scored eight of the first eleven points 
and led by as many as nine points through-
out the set, never allowing the Lumberjacks 
to pull within five points of the Triton lead. 
UCSD closed out the first set at 25-17 after 
a kill from junior middle blocker Cara 
Simonsen.

In the second set, the Lumberjacks 
played stronger, but not strong enough 
to pull ahead of the Tritons. After staying 
close to their opponents for the first half 
the set, the UCSD women went on a 5-1 
run to take a 17-11 lead. 

It was a lead the Tritons would never 
give up, and an ace from Chen finalized the 
25-19 victory.

Building off their second set-efforts, the 
Lumberjacks gave UCSD its first solid chal-
lenge of the evening — up until the Tritons 
scored seven straight points to open the 
set 15-8. 

The Humboldt blockers later proved 
to be a challenge for the Tritons, register-
ing 13 blocks against UCSD. But with 

dominant senior play from the Tritons, 
the Lumberjacks couldn’t get enough of an 
edge to rival the attack. 

Bradley and Reis notched the final kills 
of the night as UCSD took the set — and 
match — with a 25-20 victory.

“Well, I’m just looking at the posi-
tives,” Schmidt said. “I’m happy to have this 
opportunity to play with all my teammates. 
We just want to have fun out there, and 
really are a team as much as possible. It’s 
not about the scoreboard; it’s about who I’m 
playing with.”

Black said the senior night game was a 
fitting end to the regular season.

“It’s always bittersweet,” Black said. 
“You’re really going to miss them, but I’m 
really glad to be able to win in three, and 
they did a really good job. But we still got a 
lot of volleyball left in the playoffs.”

On Friday night, the Tritons defeated 
Sonoma State in three sets. Schmidt notched 
another 23 kills to help guide UCSD to its 
23rd consecutive win at RIMAC Arena.

“We have great coaches and a great 
group of girls here, working really hard,” 
Schmidt said. “It’s a definite team sport. 
The passing is great and the setting is great, 
and it’s really a team effort.”

The Tritons held the lead through the
