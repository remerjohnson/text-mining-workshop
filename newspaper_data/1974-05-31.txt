TUSC Approves New Coop Plan Muir Race May Face Problems 
The Undergraduate Student Council 

(TUSC) has voted to replace itself for 
the 1974-75 school year with a 
cooperative form of student govern-
ment. 

The Student Cooperative, proposed 
by a Coop Model-Building Committee 
and approved at TUSe's May 20 
meeting, will comprise all UCSD 
students, with representation by all 
student organizations and major 
campus committees . 

at random ." All major budgetary 
decisions, however, will be decided by 
the whole Coop. 

The report emphasized, as did 
committee member, Marco li Mandri, 
to the Triton Times, the importance of 
student interest groups in the Coop 
structure . However, states and report, 
"If many interest groups were to form 
into a central organization (the Coop) 
there would be checks prevent ing any 
one interest group from becoming too 
strong." 

by Chris Rauber 
Speaking of the Muir elections 

scheduled for June 5 and 6, MUir College 
Council member Scott Thayer said, " I'd 
be thrilled If we had ten people running 
for each position ," but his attitude was 
apprehensive, and with good reason 

The election IS being held to fill five 
openings on the Muir College Council 
(M ec.) and two on the Undergraduate 
Student Council (T USC) It IS hoped 
that there will be at least one candidate 
for each of the seven pOSitions If the 
past IS any indication, there may not be 

According to the committee's 
report, the Coop was proposed as a 
replacement for the present TUSC 
elections, which were deemed 
ineffectual. According to the report, 
the weaknesses of campus elections 
are "transcript-filling, the play on 
emotions, the selection of faces above 
issues, lack of voter education on 
issues, and low voter turnout. " 

Marco Li Mandri 
Budget 

The committee's report also stated 
the need from "bui lding a strong 
rapport with surrounding com-
munities and the administration 
simultaneously. " 

One member of the committee told 
the Triton Times that members of 
TUSC elected in the recent Revelle 
College election, and to be elected in 
the upcoming Muir College election, 
will become automatic voting 
members of the Coop, bypassing the 
regulation-requiring attendance of 
two meetings . 

As Thayer pointed out, MUir has not 
held an election for two years Only five 
people attended the last meeting of the 
Muir Town Council And the pervasive 
apathy of Muir students shows no Ign 
of abating . 

Due to the almost total lack of student 
partiCipation in student governm nt, 
vacancies on the M C.C , T U C , and 
various committees have had to be filled 
by appointment. Thus, the new system allows a vote 

on decisions to any student 
who had attended two of the three 
sessions preceeding the meeting at 
whl h th vote is to take place. 

All matters involving the allocation 
of monies to student organizations, 
presently handled by TUSC, will be 
delegated to the Coop budget 
committee. The committee will be 
composed of one representative from 
each co llege, and three at-large 
representatives, "to be chosen entirely 

Thayer noted that there is "a hortage 
of people to fill available positions," 
despite the dedication of a "c ore group" 
that is "deeply involved, trYing to change 
things " 

times 
" Personally, I feel I'm dOing something 

for the school as a whole, not for Scott 
Thayer ." 

Activists in student government realize 
that many students question the 
legitimacy of student organizations 
whose members are appointed rather 
'than elected, asking "who are you to be 
spending my money?" And others, 
Thayer admitted, wonder if student 
government is necessary at all.

Poll Finds Students 
Oppose Plus-Minus 

by Paul Osterman III 

Seve nty-two percent (72%) of students responding to 
the Registrar's poll on the controversial plus (+) minus 
(-) grading issue "prefer the present A ,B, C,D, F, P/N P, 
S/U grading system." 

Results of the poll will be presented by the Com-
mittee on Educational Policy Chairman, Dr. leonard 
Newmark to the Academic Senate Tuesday June 4, at 4 
o'clock in' USB 2722. The fate of the plus minus will be 
decided bv those professors who attend the meeting. 

Ron Bowker, Registrar, told the Triton Times, "I had a 
feeli ng that the CEP open meeting (May 9) was 
somewhat typical of student opinion , but these results 
are more concrete and typicaL" Bowker cited that 2,256 
students responded from a total nf 6,922 students 
(32.5%) whereas only one hundred ~tudents attended 
the CEP open meetings. 

One-thousand five-hundred and seventy eight (1,578) 
students affirmed their preference for, and 259 students 
dislike the present system. One-hundred and fifty (150) 
students prefer .the proposed plus minus feature and 
1 22 do not want to see the existence of the proposed f~ature . Forty-two students expressed no opinion . 

Registrar's Assistant Anne McQuerter explained the 
discrepancy between the total responses and total votes 
counted. "Many students indicated their preference for 
the present system in addition to their dislike of the 
proposed feature. However other students merely 
expressed satisfaction with the present system and went 
no further." 

"The cost was minimal and I guess I'm a good guy. 
No, I'm not really sure," Ron Bowker responded to why 
he volunteered to run the student poll . "We wanted to 
be of service." Bowker went on to say, "if no one cared 
I'd be against it just because it would increase the work 
and for this office. I'm inclined to be against it, but if it 
passes, I can live with more work." 

Bowker said that his office currently receives 1000 
plus grade changes per quarter where GPA must be 
manually recalculated . The proposal if passed will 
undoubtedly increase the number he said.

Boia Students View, Comment on UCSD 
by Roberta Rehm 

I JOined a group of 
students and professors 
from the Universidad 
Autonoma de Baja 
California last Thursday as 
they celebrated a holiday 
from classes (Mexico 's 
Student's Day) by visiti ng 
UCSD. 

COMMENTARY 
" You must practice your 

Spanish," they said to me, 
but luckily they added, 
"and we must practice our 
English ." I let them do most 
of the practicing . All 
chem i try majors at the 
Tijuana branch of the 
Autonoma, the students 
were here as part of a 
continuing exchange 
program between the 
"Asociacion Quimicada de 
Tijuana" (Chemistry 
Association) and UCSD. 

" We 're going to be 
impressed," one professor 
told me before the tour 
even started . Students 
appeared most impressed 
with UCSD's physical size 
and appearance. 

"It's very pretty, our 
school is much smaller," 
commented student Teresa 
01 mos . He~ cI assmates 
quickly agreed and no-<>ne 
could see any big dif-
ferences other than ap-
pearance between UCSD 
and the Autonoma . The 
students and teachers dress 
about the same, they said. I 
must admit, however, that 
among the women's 
tailored pant suits and the 
men's dress shirts my own 
jeans and sandals looked 
pretty casual. 

The people are the 
same," said Professor 
Octavio Castellanos . "Our 
students are the same as 
yours . They all are young 
and interested in improving 
themselves and their 
country. These are common 
factors in all generations ." 

Frank Saiz, Assistant to 

the Dean of Student Affairs 
and host to the Mexican 
visitors, commented, 
"Students are the future 
hope of Mexico , par-
ticularly in the ad-
vancement of their 
technology just as our 
students at UCSD are the 
new hope of the United 
States ." 

Chancellor McElroy sent 
greetings to the visitors 
through h is special assistant 
Jack Douglas. " I like the 
way he pronounces 
Spanish," I heard a student 
comment as Douglas read 
the Chancellor's statement 
in the guests' native tongue. 

.While we were waiting 
for the - hancelor 's 
message, the students could 
hardly bel ieve that I have 
never met Dr. McElroy. 
" Really," exclaimed one 
visitor, "i n our school we 
know most of the people 
because we are so small 
sti II." 

"We are very young, just 
beginning," said Professor 
Castellanos, about the 

. Autonoma 's School of 
Chemistry, which opened in 
February. " UCSD is a good 
school in Chemistry. We are 
trying to be at your level." 

"We are trying to make 
our students capable to 
work in industry and make 
it possible for them to do 
research, " Castellanos 
explained . Most of the 
students I talked to have 
not yet decided what 
they're going to do after 
graduation but most 
seemed to favor industrial 
work . Surprisingly, as far as 
I could tell, there wasn't a 
pre-med student in t~e 
whole group. 

After touring the campus 
in the morning, the students 
and profe sors were to be 
guests of the Chemi ~ry 
department in the af-
ternoon Graduate tud nt 
Milan Molina spoke to the 
group about the dep rt-
ment. 

program began after a visit 
from Nobel prize winner Dr. 
Hannes Alfven, APIS 
professor, to Mexico. Other 

UCSD professors to viSit 
Mexico have been Dr 
Harold Urey and Dr . Robert 
Holley. 

Benamou to Leave; 
Refuses Lit. Chair 

Michel Benamou, for five 
years a professor of French 
literature at U(SD, has 
turned down the chair-
manship of the literature 
department to head the 
Center for 20th Century 
studies at the University of 
Wisconsin . 

Benamou, who termed 
his reasons for leaving 
UCSD "personal, mostly 
monetary," said the new 
position would "give me 
broader scope . But I love 
my department (at UCSD)-
it was a very difficult and 
painful choice to leave, and 
I'm still unhappy about the 
decision ." 

He added, "Going to 
Wisconsin has an element 
of risk but it is a chance to 
grow.': He spent two and a 
half months at the 
university last year as a 
visiting Resident Professor. 
"They are very warm and 
friendly there." 

Andrew Wright , present 
chairman of the depart-
ment ' said the UC D ac-
ministration made 
counter-offer to th

but Benamou had turned it

I POLITICS: JAMES SOlO I 

RIection Countdown 
The election is only four days away and as the voter 

becomes irrevokably confused it might be interestin, to 
go over some of the highpoints of this campaigning and 
to shed some light on some of the minor state races 
which have been buried under the publicity given to the 
governor's race. 

There are six state offices besides the governor's race 
up for nomination this June. In addition there is a U.S. 
Senate seat to be decided upon. Probably the least 
controversial contest this year is the election of the 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction . Riles has 
managed to make the office apolitical in camparison to 
the Max Rafferty yeats. Riles will probably win in the 
primary as his opponents have one thing in common:no 
one knows who they are. 

The Attorney Generals race has been low key in 
comparison to previous years. Incumbent Evelle 
Younger will be nominated by Republicans. Democrats 
will vote for either William Norris, who is considered to 
be a liberal, or Vincent Bugliosi , who gained fame as the 
Jrosecuter in the Manson case . The State Treasurer's 
race is again generating yawns as Republicans and 
Democrats are both competing for honors as to see who 
can bore voters first . The big story this year is the at-
tempted political . comeback of California's own Big 
Daddy, Jess Unruh . Unruh is the former Speaker of the 
Assembly who unsuccessfully tried to defeat Ronald 
Reagan in 1970. Unruh will be facing State Senator Alan 
Short and Attorney Gray Davis, who is far and away the 
big spender. 

In the race for State Controller, Republicans are 
having an interesting race as James Flournoy (no 
relation to incumbent Houston Flournoy) and William 
Bagley are the major candidates. james Flournoy is 
running a low key campaign emphasizing mainly his 
name. Bagley, who was an ally of Reagan's in the State 
Assembly, has charged Flournoy with trying to confuse 
the voters by associating his name with that of the 
popular Houston Flournoy. In the Democratic race the 
major con tenders appear to be Assemblyman Ken Cory, 
San FranCISCO Supervisor Robert Mendelsohn, and 
C.P.A. Bert Betts . Betts was State Treasurer for eight 
years ~efore being swept out of office in the Reagan 
landslide of 1966. Mendelsohn and especially Cory have 
I,een spending a lot of money 

Attention in the Secretary of State's-- office has 
centered around the Democratic nomination . Mud-
slinging has been especially obvious as educater Cathy 
O'Neil has charged Walter Karabian as being a tool of 
special interests. However Karabian has a distinguished 
career In the State Assembly which should assist him 
with dealing with the O'Neil allegations. Assem-
blywoman March Fong of Oakland and Herman Sillas 
also are factors in the race. Sillas could very well take 
the Spanish vote while Fong and O'Neill split the 
feminist vote, thus helping Karablan . With Karabian an 
Armenian and Fong of Chinese descent, the race for 
Secretary of State is the most cosmopolitan of races. 

The Lt . Governor's race has attracted concentrated 
effort from the Democrats. Republicans will 
probably nominate john Harmer. the ~tate Senator from 
Glendale over john Veneman . The Republicans appear 
to be saving their energy for the general election in the 
fall. Eight Democrats are running but only four or five 
are given any chance of winning. They are Orange 
County Supervisor Robert Battin, Lawyer and "ad-
vocate" Howard Miller, State Senator Mervyn Dymally, 
State Senator Larry Walsh , and Elizabeth Wiegand . The 
campaign started with Dymally the candidate with the 
most voter recognition Howard Miller had been gaining 
strength but Battin and Walsh have started heavy media 
campaigns the last two weeks. At this ooint any of the

It was a hot day .in the 
summer of '94 and 
Carruthers and I had taken 
refuge from our practices in 
the club . ..our tempers being 
what they were, I was 
sipping on a glass of claret 
while Carruthers was 
inhaling a light bourbon. 
We were discussing a recent 
operation done in the States 
when Carruthers suddenly 
stopped and pointed to a 
tall, bearded gentleman 
across the room . 

"That man over there!" 
he said. " I must introduce 
you to him. Come, Colin ." 

Carruthers strode across 
the room, me at his heels, 
and tapped the man on the 
shoulder. 

" I have someone for you 
to meet, doctor." he ex-
plained, nodding to me. 

The man slowly turned 
and cast two baleful eyes 
upon mine. It was un-
settling and I offered my 
hand quickly. 

'The name is Williams, 
sir. Colin Williams." 

"And mine is Schitt," he 
said, smoothly grasping my 
hand, " jack Schitt." 

His grip was like iron. I 
wiped off the rust. With a 
wave of his hand, he 
motioned us to join his 
table . 

"I'm afraid this must have 
appeared a bit mysterious 
to you, Colin . I thought you 
would wish to meet Dr. 
Schitt because he is per-
forming operations here in 
London similar to those we 
were just discussing." 

"Ah, a fortunate meeting 
indeed," I smiled. "Tell me, 
doctor . Do you have any 
trQuble procuring animals 
ror your t!xperiments?" 

He smi led thinly. "Many 
times they walk in from the 
street. " 

" I see. You use dogs, 
then , doctor?" 

The good doctor seemed 
to consider his answer. 
"Yes," he concluded, "I 
guess that some could be 
called that..." 

I couldn't run away from 
the troubling impreSSion 
that our thoughts were 
moving in different circles . 
And a small gleam shone 
from his chin, caught and 
reflected by the dribble 
flowing out the corner of 
his mouth. 

• _ •• * 

Several weeks later, I was 
sitting in my office in a 
disgusted frame of mind. 
On the desk before me was 
a case history of a'man who 
had just been released froID 
my care. He had Jlad ter-
minal crotch rot; a con-
dition I had been able to 
diagnose upon our first 
meeting. Of course, am-
putation was the only 
treatment left open to me. 
Today he walked in and 
proudly showed off his 
padded jock strap and 
therapeutic pants . 

Quite frankly, I was 
bored at my mundane 
practice. I was seriously 
conSidering sending a 
bubonic plague culture to 
the lab just to stir things up 
when I found Dr. Schitt's 
card in my breast pocket. 

Dr . Schitt had given me 
h is card at the end of our 
tete-a-tete and h ad asked 
me to visit him at his office 
in the west end. I decided 
to go. I left word for my 
receptionist to cancel all 
further appointments ' for 
the day. I took my umbrella 
anri rulled my bowler low 
over my eyes so I wouldn't 
see the looks of my patients 
as I left. Also, I took my bag 
to give the Impression of 
goi ng to some emergency.

of a narrow open staircase. 
Curiously, there was a hoist 
jutting out from the wall 
just above a large shuttered 
window. 

I knocked and some 
specie of nurse adOJitted 
me. As I passed her, she 
stuck her head out the door 
and scanned the street 
before clOSing it. Then, with 
a "Good afternoon, sir," she 
led me towards a heavy 
door when we were stopped 
by Dr. Schitt's voice . 

"No, Marta. This is Dr. 
Williams. Come with me, 
Colin. I have something to 
show you ." 

Dutifully, I followed him 
to his operating theatre. 

"Beyond this door is my 
latest experimental effort in 

the field of neurosurgery," 
he proudly spoke . He 
opened the door, and to my 
horror, I saw the prostrate 
form of a middle-aged man. 
The man appeared dead. 

"What travesty is this?" I 
demanded . 

"Why, Williams! Have 
you no appreciation of

"Which is7" 
"Why don't you watch 

and see?" He grabbed the 
door and yelled for Marta to 
prepare to assist him. And 
while he and Marta 
scrubbed up, I sat and 
waited . Dr. Schitt gave the 
patient another injection of 
morphine before beginning. 

Marta shaved the man's 
head . After she had 
finished, Dr. Schitt marked 
the portion of skull to be 
removed with a pen . He 
then produced what looked 
suspiciously like a saw of 
the cross-cut variety and 
began to saw. 

"Mr. Leroy here wants to 
be a un iversity ad -
ministrator, you see," Dr. 
Schitt explained. 

" And you intend to make 
him one by surgery?" 

" Of course not, Col in . I 
merely wish to confer upon 
him some of the attributes 
that would make his ap-
pointment more certain ." 

"And what operation will 
do thiS, " I pressed . 

Dr . Schitt stopped and 
looked at me, frowning 
slightly . " A frontal 
lobotomy , of co urse , 
doctor ." 

As soon as Mr Leroy had 

regained consciousness, I 
begged my leave and made 
straight for the offices of 
the Rich Iljdependent 
Physicians . I asked for and 
was granted an interview 
with the director. 

"Ah , Williams ! Come in " 
he greeted . " It is rare to s~e 
one of our members here in 
the RIP offices ." 

''I'll get straight to the 
point, doctor," I stated, 
seating myself. "What can 
you tell me about jack 
Schitt?" 

"A lot," he answered, 
leaning back in his chair. 
" In fact, one could say he 
was in trumental to my 
career in medicine." 

" No doubt, " I com-

mented bitterly. I rose to 
leave. "Thank you for your 
time," I said . "Good-bye." 

*** .. * 

There was little to be 

done. Apparently, Dr. Schilt 
was unstoppable. He was in 
the habit of securing legal 
permission from his 
patients, thus staying with In 
the law. Ethically, he was 
on firm ground as far as the 
director of the medical 
society wa concerned . 

To satisfy my troubled 
conSCience , th'en , I 
resolved to be pre ent at Dr. 
Schitt's ubsequent 
operations in order to make 

sure nothing Illegal hap-
pened. 

" This should be a 
relatively easy one, Colin," 
Schitt told me "Tell him 
what you want to be, Mr 
Brookman ." 

" I want to be a university 
legal counsel," the poor 
man said. 

Dr Schitt gave the man a 
morphine Injection and 
suited up. Once again, 
Marta shaved him and, 
once again, Schitt removed 
a part of the patient's sku II . 

" Marta , scalpel," he 
commanded . Blade In 
hand, he carefully removed 
the membrane blocking 
him . Finished, he looked at 
me momentarily 

" Now comes the Im-
portant part, " he confided . 
"Marta! Bring me the egg-
beater ." 

I didn't stay for the rest.

er.wHnat Eye Report 
W~o Are Those Guys? 

Why would the government kill its own agents : 
people <15k me, as if the extermination of Donald 
"Cinque" OeFreeze and co. sends all conspirac'y talk 
swirling down the pipes like so much Draino-freed 
sludge. let me quickly point out in response that at least 
two major conspiracy researchers predictedin print the 
May 17 extermination . The April 19 Berkeley Barb 
carried an article entitled " Is SlA's Cinque the First 
Black lee Harvey Oswald?" on its front cover. The 
article was an interview with Mae Brussell , who fit the 
SLA matter into a Hitlerian scenario of Reichstag-fire 
style government stagings . About the SLA she said, 
"Whi Ie PatriCia Hearst, Donald DeFreeze and Thero 
Wheeler are alive, there is no way to link the SLA to the 
Bay Area murders, because they were not involved in 
any of them. If the political patsies are killed, the law 
enforcement agents will associate a huge secret 'army' 
and 'cult' of blacks to all the murders ... Nothing can be 
smeared more easily than a dead body" (p. 11). 

Then on May 13, Atlanta's The Great Speckled Bird 
printed a cover story about the speculations of 
Glasshouse Tapes contributor Donald Freed. The story 
was titled "SlA's Cinque Linked to Calif . Attorney 
General" and contained the following : "Briefly, it is 
Freed's contention that Donald DeFreeze, 'General Field 
Marshall Cinque' of the Symbionese Liberation Army, 
had been in the employ of California Attorney General 
Evelle J. Younger as an agent since Younger was district 
attorney in Los Angeles in 1967. In California the office 
of Attorney General is an elective one and this is an 
election year and for that reason, Freed feels Younger 
wants DeFreeze dead and silent." 

r or an analogy to Cinque's plight. we need go back 
only eleven years to consider the situation of Lee 
Harvey Oswald . Oswald realized how he'd been duped 
and indeed uttered the succinct " I am a patsy" to 
newsmen before jack Ruby was able to complete the 
"double-takeout."· (The footage of Oswald making this 
statement IS among the documentary portions of the 
film " Executive Action.") Other noted patsies of recen' 
vintage include Ruby, Sirhan Sirhan, james Earl Ray 
and Arthur Bremer . Their cases will be discus ed in 
future Eye installments. 

For now. however, an effort must be mounted to 
counteract official and media propaganda in the SLA 
matter This is most immediately accomplished by-
compili ng "patsy" profiles of the six SLA members who 
have already been prevented from telling their own 
stories : 

1. Donald DeFreeze - I have published a great deal 
of documented material already in The North Star and 
TT about De Freeze's function ing as a police agent. I 
refer the unconvinced to the May 11 issue of the San 
Francisco Chronicle and a front-page story by Paul 
Avery . The story charges that De Freeze operated as an 
agent from 1967, when he turned in a crime partner to 
L.A. police, to at least 1969, when he was sent to 
Vacaville Medical Facility. LA PO Chief Edward Davis 
denied all but the 1967 involvement, but, Avery writes, 
"The official statement seemed to conflict with in-
formation obtained by The Chronicle ..... (Eye emphasis) . 
For further confi rmation , the story cites The Glasshouse 
Tapes compilers Citizens Research and Investigation 
Committee and Louis Tackwood himself, who said he 
knew DeFreeze when both worked for the Criminal 
Conspiracy Section (Red squad) of the LAPD In-
telligence Unit. 

Private investigator Lake Headly is cited as obtaining 
yet further confirmation in an interview with LAPD 
Sergeant R G. Farwell , who was DeFreeze' "handler" in 
the c.C.S. The Chronicle tried independently to get 
Farwell to talk on the matter, but by then he had been 
ordered silent by "superiors ." 

Those who have read The Glasshouse Tapes will 
recognize Farwell as Tackwood's contact during his 
career with the c.C.S . (p. 37) . Lake Headly is an 
associate of Vincent Bugliosi, who currently is running 
against Evelle Younger for Attorney General of 
California. 

2. Nancy Ling Perry - Ms. Perry was an "enthusiastic 
supporter" of Berry Goldwater in his 1964 Presidential 
campaign (l.A. Times, 5-19-74, p . 1). Yet in a com-
munique publbhed in part in Bay Area dailies and in 
full in the Barb (1-25-74), she,states "When I was in high 
school n 1963~, I witnessed the first military coup 
against we the people oi this country ." This is a 
referent e to the john Kennedy assassination . Anybody 
that av a~e in '63-64 was severely out of place in 
Goldwa!et's camp. She seems to anticipate the obvious 
questio 1S about her radical grounding by promising 
early in the communique to diSCUSS "the evolution of 
my cor s lousness." but there i~ iiO mpntlnn of the 
Goldwa:f> experiE'nce and only vague reference to 
" liVing n Amenkkka" and "a prison back ground" to 
accoun for the evolution" 

3 P a(rl<:la Sultysik - Ms. oltysik knew Derreeze 
from h >r VISlt~ With the prISoners at VacaVille (LA 
Times, 5-19-74. p 16) Authorities now say they believe

Editor : book. same I 
As I think every con-

cerned American must do, I 
asked myself what I , as an 
Individual, could do to 
improve what I considered 
to be a deplorable state of 
political dishonesty and 
misrepresentation of the 
people . 

I am placing myself as a How many votes do I 
write-in candidate for hope to receive? Perhaps 
County Treasurer. I am not ten. Perhaps one thousand. 
a registered candidate Or even ten thousand . 
(other than as a write-in), I ONLY YOU, the voter, can

contributions over ten VOTEI 

For the first few elect ions, 
I was eligible to vote in, my 
futile form of protest was 
simply to not vote. I was 
told this was a pitiful "cop-
out", and came to 
recognize it as such . After 
that, I wrote in the name of 
the person I felt best 
qualified to fill an office-
even that of President-and 
voted for them. 

This was more honest, 
more construct ive, but 
equally Ineffectual. One 
write-in vote can easily be 
ignored by the corrupt 
bureaucrats who hold, not 
all , but many public of-
ficers . It can also be 
laughed at by them as a 
weak attempt to return 10 
the true concept of the 
people's choice gaining 
office. 

Too long have we 
allowed 'the two-party 
system to run and rui n our 
country, complaining and 
threaten ing, but st ill voting 
"the ticket" . So I have 
deCided to try and show the 

dollars, and on Iy from 
private citizens, and am 
planning on spending no 
more money than necessary 
for stamps, envelopes, and 
write-in registration fee. I 
would like to make the city, 
the politicians, and the 
people aware that the 
PEOPLE sti ll have a free and 
effective voice. 

My qualifications are 
only two : I am at least as 
intelligent as any other 
candidate for this office, 
and I am Honest. Is not 
honesty as great a virtue as 
experience? 

If you consider th is a 
joke, then vote for me as 
uch. If you have been 

hunting for some 
meaningful form of protest 
against all of the corruption 
and malignance in 
government, then write my 
name in as protest. If you 
just wish to see how 
powerful the individual 
vote can still be, put my 
name on your ballot. 

If not for me, then vote 
for the person you feel best 
qualified to fill any office, 
not just that of treasurer . 

4. Willie Wolfe - Wolfe, a white, was a "tutor" in the 
Black Cultural Association at Vacaville . The BCA is 
believed to have been the ideological birthplace of the 
SLA. Wolfe came west from Pennsylvan ia in 1971 . 
Before that time he is not known to have had an interest 
in black causes (Barb, p. 13). 

5. Camilla Hall - Ms. Hall came to Berkeley from 
Minneapolis in 1970 and took an apartment with 
Patricia Soltysik (lATimes, 5-20-74, p. 20) . 

6. Angela Atwood - Ms. Atwood and her husband 
came to the Bay Area from Indiana in the summer of 
1971 (l.A. Times, 5-18-74, p. 24). Friends Bill and Emily 
Harris followed about six months later and took Angela 
in when she left her husband (Ibid .) (This pattern of 
east-to-west migration in 1970-72 and then SlA in 1973-
74 holds true also for Russell Little and Robyn Steiner, 
who both came to Berkeley from Florida in fall , 1972 -
Barb, p. 13.) 

There seems to me to be several levels of operatives 
in this SLA thing. Due to space limitations, a discussion 
of this must be postponed until next issue. I will say now 
though that I believe nearly all of the low-level 
operatives, the "patsies," have been eliminated and that 
Patricia Hearst is in the custody of the higher-ups : e.g. 
Emily and Bill Harris. Watch their movements closely. 

Next installment : Why exactly the patsies had to be 
killed and how it was accomplished. 

'''doub le-takeout'' - classic gangster strategy. Have the 
desired target killed and then cover your tracks by 
silenCing the hit-man .

Thanks 
Editor : 

I am responding to those 
dedicated students who so 
eagerly strive to protect the 
interest of the student 
body. To Those Students I 
want to say-Hey! You're 
alright! Thanks for building 
yourself a pseudo 
associated student 
government. Put togeth r 
well, and rarely in need of 
repair or change. your 
institution will never fall 
Knowing that you will fight 
its status to the death if 
challenged is indeed 
gratifying. 

Thanks for being the 
tightly knit group necessary 
to vent off those who " lack 
discretion" and are " too 

hone~t " They are surely 
incompetent next to 
yourselves, and don ' t 
deserve the positions held 
like phalli between your 
legs. 

We all know bastard 
journalists can't be sensitive 
when they "satarize," at-
tack your procedures, and 
"muckrake ." That's not in 
the student interest . Let's 
hope your poetic 
relationship recen tly 
established with a Triton 
Times "stud" will help to 
put that insensitive group 
back on the right path--the 
"student interest." 

Thanks for the op-
portunity to " join the 
bureaucracy." Think of the 
power students will think 
they have when they spend 
their lime and energy on 
pseudo advisory com o' 
mlttees. which in reality 
have no power You are 
truly masters of 
manipulating public 
opinion

members are supporting

, No Place To Be Somebody 
Seeing " No Plilce to be 

Somebody" is a way to find out 
what black theatre is about as well 
as a soul-searching way to spend 
the eveninR. 

Charles Gordone's Pulitzer prize-
winning play, produced by the 
UCSD Drama Dept., brings to 
attention the abundance of black 
talent in the San Diego community. 
Director Floyd Gaffney has given 
black actors in the area an op-
portunity to perform with UCSD 
students. and the result is a sl ick, 
professional production which is so 
true-to-life that one never 'escapes' 
anywhere, but is constantly 
brought back to face oneself. 

The set is the same for all three 
acts : Johnny's Bar . The plot 
revolves around Johnny, a young 
black who has been waiting ten 
years for his idol, Sweets Crane, to 
be released from prison . Sweets 
comes out broken, full of 
moralistic advice to Johnny, saying 
he's going straight. Johnny tries to 
organize hisownprogrambyusing a 
white civil rights worker, daughter 
of a prominent judge. He has her 
steal some files from her father. 
The results are violent, sobering, 
and realistic 

Johnny (Gary Morgan) is one 
cold dude. The only emotion he 
shows is hiS deadly hatred for 
anything white . Yet there is 
something about him, beSides 
money, that keeps his whores (Dee, 
Evie. Annette), his employees 
(Shanty and Melvin) and friends 
(Gabe) around . Gary Morgan is 
excellent in hiS ability to play 
Johnny as the pimp that he is, and 
et creating In the audience an 

empathy for johnny's position in 
society . Gabe (David Meyers), and 
Gordone's mouthpiece in the play, 
performs the monologues which 
which set the mood between 
scenes with skill. That he doesn't 
quite come off as black is no 
criticism; he and Shanty are 
cultural abortions and must be 
praised for getting across that 
being black and being white goes 
deeper than skin color . Shanty 
(Gerardo Lopez) is a young white 
man who has grown up In johnny's 
world. Although he complains 
about the way Johnny Ireats him. 
he always comes back to lick up 
more 

Melvin (James Avery), plumply 
sasHaying hopplty-hop across the 
stage, delivers his lines With a 
finesse which goes beyond the 
usual wrist-flopping of actors 
playing gays The prostitutes are 
interesting in their differences Dee 
( ancy Amitin) has a pathetic 
facade of pride and classier-than-
these-other-bitches vOice which is 
vE'ry effective . Evie (Dorothy 
Saunders) comes out hard, brassy 
and stereotYPical , but show tear-
Jerker tenderness for Dee In a scene 
where a drunken and desperate 
Dee tries to blacken her face With 
shoe polish . 

Sweets Cran (Joe Thompson) 
looks like he just came from the 
Bowery, only his been-<lown- 0-
long appearance Isn't from being a 
WinO and only death looks-Ilke-up-
to him . Whatever they did to him 
In the slammer IS irreverSible . HIS 
rehabilitation IS so complete It 
make lohnny want to puke . 

Mary Lou Bolton (Heidi 
Ickerson) and Ellen (Katy 

Sullivan), the white Civil rights 

worker), alt: so stereotypical it 
almost seems unjust until one has 
to admit they are too accurate. 
Gordone uses them differently 
from the main characters. They are 
less developed, one-sided symbols. 
This holds true for Mike Maffucci 
(Ron Shapiro) and Judge Bolton 
(Ray Roberts). That the Mafia is 
Italian and more powerful than 
black hustlers or white Judges, and 
that Judges are usually white and 
often look. walk and talk like Judge 
Bolton -these are realities that 
Gordone merely records as a 
diligent commentator on con-
temporary society 

Cordone has used the language 
of hiS characters In writing their 
lines It is pOSSIble that some lines 
Will be missed by those members of 
the audience not familiar With 
certain slang expressIons or With 
the pronunci ation of some words 

Gaffney has Improved upon the 
SCfl pt by changing the ending 
slightly to achieve a production 
whose driving force and rapid pace

In signing off this spring quarter , I'd like to end with 
the thought (however trite it seems) that "art" can be 
found, not only in museums, but in the swaying of a tree 
limb; " music" can be heard, not only in concert halls, 
but also in the sonorous lapping of waves on a beach.

SPO 
1M FloQr Hockey 
.Highsticks Abound 

Due to the un-
derwhelming response to 
last weeks report on coed 
floor hockey, tl)e 1M Dept . 
has returned with a request 
for another article . As was 
stated in the last article, the 
league consists of eight 
teams, with roughly an 
equal amount of guys and 
girls on each team . 

The front running team in 
the league is EI Chunko, 
rumor has it that they won 
the league Wednesday 
night by splitting their last 
two games. They finished 
the season with an almost 
perfect record of 7-1. losing 
only on the last night of 
play by a close 3-2 score. 
The team IS lead by the 
league's only superstar Jeff 
Cannis, who literally 
controls the tempo of the 
games that he plays in . 
Corey Wong and Corky Hull 
provide excellent support 
for Cannis on the floor, 
while Kirk Robinson has 
performed adequately in 
the nets EI Chunko also has 
a superb bunch of females, 
led by Kerry Dunne, they 

are probably the highest 
scoring group of girls in the 
league. 

Another top team in the 
league is the Puckers . Lead 
by the goalie work of Mike 
Bemski , they finished the 
season with a 6-2 record , 
losi ng a shot at the 
championship, when they 
dropped an overtime game 
to EI Chunko, 3-2. 

From this point the 
league begins to get mired 
down in the usual assembly 
around the middle of the 
pack . Somewhere i n the 
middle of this mess are the 
Punks, the Puckpushers, 
Untitled VII and God Only 
Knows. 

The Punks are led by 
none other than Dick 
Duncan, probably the 
quickest player in t he 
league. The Punks have a~so 
utilized a female goalie, 
thus providing a little more 
offensive punch . 

The Puckpush!!rs have 
done amazingly well for a 
team of its size, where at 
times they have barely had 
enough players to field a 

team , yet they have 
probably won more than 
they have lost. Many of 
their games have been 
close, usually decided by 
one goal, but to the dismay 
of the opposition the Puck-
pushers have frequently 
come out on top. 

Untitled V II had its 
season made for them when 
they knocked off EI Chunko 
on Wednesday night. As 
they have all season they 
utilized the superb net-
minding of Paul Wagner to 
pull off the upset. Paul is 
the premier goalie in the 
league. The only problem 
UT VII has encountered thiS 
season is a severe lack of 
players ; they have often 
reli ed on spectators to fi II 
out the ir team . 

God Only Knows has 
been plagued by the same 
probl em as UT VII ; lack of 
players, yet they still have 
managed to salvage a 
decent seaso n after a 
horrendous start .

Down at the bottom of 

the league, but not in-
dicative of their true talent, 
are Fat Chance and the one 
and only ~ther Puckers . 

Fat Chance joined the 
league late, coming up 
against well practiced 
teams, and promptly lost 
their first few games. 

The Mother Puckers, led 
by Dirk Siaker and Chuck 
Hess, are a talented team, 
but always seem to be on 
the short end of a one goal 
decision. 

Due to the popularity of 
this new game the In-
tramural Department has 
hinted at the possibillcy of 

making Floor Hockey a year 
round 1M event, which 
most of the present players 
heartily agree with.

The tradition has been 
established, it is up to the 
current population of UCSD 
to continue it. From the 
past come the lamen-

tradition grow and be

The Muir College 
Council, for example, may 
not be "looked upon as a 
legitimate organization by 
the students, or some of 
them, but, " he insisted 
" we're doing things that 
need to be done." As the 
"centralized voice of the 
students , we try to cultivate 
channels of communication 
and change," and without 
such "a clearing house for 
information" the students 
would " get screwed ." 

According to the fresh-
man council member, the 
upcoming Muir elections 
will give students "a better 
opportunity to get in-
volved", as well as giving 
student activists the op-
portunity to legitimize their 
status, an opportunity to 
say "you had a chance to 
vote."

candidates include physician Earl W . Bnan. former

State Senator H.L. Richardson . 

The major contenders appear to be Brian , Johnson,

outside chance. However, conservatives usually win
