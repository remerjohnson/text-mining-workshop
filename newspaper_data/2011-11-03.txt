Associate Vice President of Academic 
Affairs Mac Zilber announced plans for 
standing workspaces in the planned Center 
for Library & Instructional Computing 
Service lecture hall at A.S. Councils meeting 
on Wednesday, Oct. 26.

Zilber estimates that there would be 
only between three and 10 total standing 
workspaces in a new CLICS lecture hall. 
These standing workspaces are individual 
podiums where students can stand and 
take notes during a lecture instead of at 
traditional sitting desks. They are meant to 
aid students with disabilities. CLICS was 
shut down June 10, 2011 after $3 million in 
library budget cuts.

Zilber said that there are health benefits 
for users of standing work spaces.

The issue of standing desks came to my 
attention around a year ago when there was 
a major study that came out that came to the 
conclusion ... that [said] the amount of time 
that a person spends sitting has a strikingly 
large effect on a persons mortality, Zilber 
said. The data suggests that people who sit 
more than six hours a day have an increased 
rate of mortality of around 30 percent.

After assuming his position 
as AVP of Academic Affairs, 
Zilber  began bringing up the 
standing desks idea in meetings with the 
University Registrar, heads of the Academic 
Senate and the AVP of Undergraduate 
Education, only be told that there was 
likely not enough funding for wide-scale 
implementation of standing workspaces.

Zilber then took the idea to the Office 
for Students with Disabilities, which was 
planning to build more standing desks in 
response to the American Disabilities Acts 
Standards for Accessible Design. The ADAs 
standards code, enacted last year, calls for 
the availability of such seats.

Zilber said that while the reasoning for 
his advocacy for the desks is health-based, 
students with disabilities would be priority.

Its unclear whether this would be 
strictly a disability-based thing or if there 
would be a number of standing desks that 
people could use, Zilber said.

CLICS is undergoing the transition from 
a resource center to a complex that includes 
a new lecture hall. According to a Sept. 30 
A.S. Council press release, the new hall is 
expected to be complete by Fall 2012. 

Classroom Space Advisory Committee 
undergraduate representative Sammy 
Chang said that the new lecture hall in 
Galbraith will be more comfortable.

The new lecture hall will hold about 
400 seats and will be more accommodating 
to disabled students, he said.

S tudents may no longer receive free bus fare or city shuttle service if Parking and Transportation Services decides to decrease 
these services in order to offset its multi-million 
dollar deficit.

Parking and Transportation Services is 
considering two options to manage its deficit, 
which is running in the millions of dollars. One 
option would be to decrease costs by cutting 
transportation services. The other option would 

increase revenue by raising the prices of parking 
permits and citations. According to Parking 
and Transportation Services, since parking and 
transportation share one source of income, 
possible solutions are limited. 

Obviously, nobody wants to pay higher 
permit prices and, in fact, Transportation 
Services has noted that when prices get too high, 
people convert to using public transportation 
as an alternative, former Transportation Policy 
Committee undergraduate representative Adam 
Powers said. However, due to the fact that public 
transportation is currently free, such a switch 

converts a student from someone who is actively 
funding the system to someone that is actively 
using a resource.

Powers served as the A.S. Undergraduate 
Representative to the Transportation Policy 
Committee for the 2010-11 academic year. His 
term ended Nov. 1.

Last week was the first time the Transportation 
Services problem was brought to this years A.S. 
Council, although it had been discussed in Spring 
Quarter 2011. A.S. President Alyssa Wing said

▶ La Jolla City Council approved plans for 
construction of a helipad for the new UCSD 
Sulpizio Cardiovascular Center. The helipad will 
be located near Regents Road and Eastgate Mall. 

▶ Chief Executive of UCSD Health Tom Jackiewicz 
resigns Dec. 1 to become Senior Vice President 
and Chief Executive for University of Southern 
California Health. Jackiewicz starts his new job 
Jan. 1, 2012. Jackiewicz came to UCSD Health as its 
Chief Financial Officer in 2001 and served as Chief

“Tangled” to control the sheen, highlights and color 
in Rapunzel’s hair.

▶The San Diego Board of Education announced 
Tuesday that its plans to shut down schools will no 
longer go into effect. School Board Officials voted 
5 to 0 to keep the schools open. San Diego Union 
School District will consider consolidating a few 
campuses but only if it would improve conditions 
for teachers and students. SDUSD faces a loss of 
$60 to $100 million in budget cuts this year. School 
closures were expected to save $5 million. 

▶A 20-year-old woman filed a paternity lawsuit in 
San Diego County against Justin Bieber on Oct. 31. 
Mariah Yeater claims she met Bieber at the Staples 
Center on Oct. 25, 2010 and that he suggested 
they go into a bathroom. Bieber reportedly said he 
wanted to make love to her and that it was his first 
time. Yeater wants Bieber to take a paternity test 
and pay child support.  

▶San Diego and Chula Vista firefighters rescued 
five people trapped in a tunnel in Otay Mesa on 
Nov. 2. The secret tunnel is believed to connect 
Mexico with Otay Mesa. The five people were 
reportedly trapped at a fence in the tunnel where 
entrance to the U.S. was impossible.   

▶Occupy Oakland protesters shut down the Port 
of Oakland Nov. 2 as part of its citywide general 
strike. The Port of Oakland is the fifth largest port 
in the nation. Police estimate 3,000 people gathered 
at the port. 

▶Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously Nov. 
2 to fine dog owners if their dog barks too much. 
The charges would start at a $250 fine for a first 
offense, $500 for a second offense and $1000 for 
a third if offense. The council defined excessive 
barking as longer than 10 minutes or intermittently 
for 30 minutes or more.

▶According to the 2011 National Gang Threat 
Assessment, fans of Detroit based hip-hop duo 
Insane Clown Posse are considered gang members. 
The Juggalos, fans who are known to paint their 
faces similar to the musicians and congregate 
online, are recognized as a gang in Arizona, 
California, Utah and Pennsylvania. The report 
identified criminal Juggalos affiliates in as many 
as 21 states.



THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 3,  2011 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 3

she was anticipating the issue coming 
back.

“[Transportation Services] is 
trying to save more money than they 
were [in Spring Quarter 2011], and 
I think that’s commendable,” Powers 
said. “I think the student leaders that 
might be involved in any decisions 
should feel safe knowing that these 
kinds of possible cuts to service are 
far more necessary now than they 
were previously.”

At this point, Powers said the 
most cost-effective measure 
Transportation Services can make is 
to cut the free MTS bus zone.

“The question going forward is 
if we are comfortable buying MTS 
transit passes on an as-needed basis, 
purely for those who use MTS 
services, or if we want to voluntarily 
contribute a smaller amount of 
money to keep the MTS ‘free’ bus 
zone available for all students as a 
default privilege,” Powers said.

Wing plans to include 
transportation issues and possible 
solutions on the fall quarter survey 
to be distributed early in winter 
quarter in order to get an overall 
view of student preferences regarding 

transportation.
“Everyone’s transportation varies, 

so I think it’s important to gauge 
students on the whole,” Wing said. “I 
know it’s a very important resource 
for students. Last year, I used MTS, 
so I can relate to that.”

Wing also plans on using Library 
Walk tabling hours on Wednesday 
afternoons to talk with students 
about transportation.

“I also feel that if it is something 
that’s going to be presented to our 
council, we will be doing a lot of 
outreach in college council visits and 
tours with student organizations,” 
Wing said. “I am a fan of talking 
to students and getting that real 
interaction, but I know I won’t be able 
to reach all students, so these surveys 
are [also] important.”

Wing also plans on having 
A.S. Senators talk to students that 
attend their office hours about 
transportation.

If the MTS services are cut, 
Transportation Services will initiate 
a student-fee program. This is a 
quarterly pass that students who 
use MTS services can buy through 
Transportation Services at a cheaper 
rate than the standard city rate.

“A referendum would have to be 
through A.S., but everyone that has 
the slightest influence on campus 
should be having these conversations 
and thinking about how they want 
public transportation to be structured 
in the future,” Powers said.

Powers also notes that even 
though MTS buses would no longer 
be a default privilege for all students, 
MTS buses will still be coming to 
campus and available for students 
to use.

“Think about this like Student 
Legal Services, tutoring, the athletics 
facilities or S.A.R.C.,” Powers said. 
“These are things that we all pay for, 
but not everyone uses, but I would 
hope that every student would agree 
that it’s worth paying for in case it is 
needed.”

Powers urges students to have 
strong opinions about this by the end 
of the year. If there is a possibility 
for a referendum, it will most likely 
appear on the Spring ballot.

Director of Transportation 
Services Brian DeMeulle could not be 
reached for comment as of press time.

Today was an important day 
for A.S. Council — Student Regent 
Alfredo Mireles, Jr. and Student 
Regent Designate Johnathan Stein 
addressed them with state and UC 
budgets concerns.

They informed council that 
the UC system 
is facing a $2.5 
billion deficit by 
the 2014-2015 
academic year. 
Most of this debt, 
they reported, is 
from legitimate 
budget problems 
like enrollment growth costs, 
compensation, and post-employee 
benefits. 

However, they only have a 
prospected $1 billion in solutions. 
The UC system needs to find a way 
to raise the additional $1.5 billion.

One potential solution is to raise 
funds from corporations.

“I oppose Chevron donating 
to a chemistry program to fund 
research they want done, or tobacco 
companies funding public health 
programs,” Stien said, “but now 
I support unrestricted funding 
because every $100,000 we gain 
from fundraising is $100,000 that 
does not need to be covered by 
students.”

Vice President of Finance 
and Resources Kevin Hoang was 
concerned about maintaining the 
quality of students in the UC system 
with the increase in recruitment 
from out-of-state students.

“Honestly, they’re pretty bomb,” 
Stein said. “They are usually [more 
qualified] than in-sate students. 
Sometimes, not by much, but usually 
[more qualified].”

Their presentation ended in a 
group photo including everyone in 

A.S. Council, the Student Regents, 
and anyone in the audience. While 
they invited me to join in and I 
was tempted to have my moment of 
being a permanent memory in an 
A.S. photo, I respectfully declined 
the offer.

A s s o c i a t e 
Vice President 
of Student 
Advocacy Bryce 
F a r r i n g t o n 
reported that the 
Conduct Code 
Committee has 
addressed the 

jurisdiction concerns brought forth 
by council. 

The code will be changed and 
clarified so that you cannot be 
charged for an off-campus offence 
if a non-campus person does not 
file a report and that a method 
will be available for students to 
appeal whether the campus can take 
jurisdiction.

“Your concerns were the 
primary concerns they addressed,” 
Farrington said, beaming with pride 
at the input Council has given in 
previous meetings.

Hoang then handed out slips for 
a lovely council-bonding activity: 
Council Lunch Buddies!

“I’m making the initial pairing 
for you, but it’s up to you to call 
them up,” he encouraged. So little 
faith, Hoang. You should know 
how enthusiastic everyone is about 
council bonding.

Muir Senator Elizabeth Garcia 
reported an upsetting, new federal 
law regarding financial aid.

“If you fall below a 2.0 [GPA] 
or do not complete 36 units a year, 
you will lose your financial aid

automatically,” she said.
She also said that you will still 

have the opportunity to appeal, but 
that is a two to three week process 
and you will be required to pay 
tuition out-of-pocket if fees are due.

Vice President of Student Life 
Meredith Madnick filled in for 
Council Speaker Ryan O’Rear. 
As such, she asked herself who 
Council Member of the Week was. 

She responded that she would 

announce it. She proudly bestowed 
the blue, glittery sash upon 
Roosevelt College Senator Jackie 
Calvin.

While the announcement 
resulted in an uproar of applause 
and a repeat of Maroon 5’s “Moves 
like Jagger,” I did manage to 
hear Madnick say that Calvin is 
“sporting this year’s hottest trend: 
Council spirit!”

The meeting was then closed 
to discuss the impeachment 
of Marshall Senator Summer 

Perez. After an hour and a half of 
deliberation and a vote of 17-9-9, 
the motion was declined. In the 
case of an impeachment, a two-
thirds vote is required.

While the atmosphere was dark 
and tense in the room after the 
vote, Council remained optimistic 
and reminded each other that what 
is most important is to support 
each other, no matter what people 
voted, making this issue yet another 
obstacle for this loving family to 
face together.

It’s no secret that transportation for students in San Diego is sub-par. The buses are consistently unreliable. The Old Town trolley 
extension to UCSD and University Town 
Center won’t be built until 2015. And 
attempts to find parking are futile, partly 
as a result of a 133-student parking 
space reduction just last fall. 

So for students both on campus and 
in the surrounding area, the 
UCSD shuttle system is a 
godsend. Besides the obvi-
ous benefit of being free, 
the shuttle system has 11 
routes with popular stops 
at Mesa Housing, Hillcrest 
and Scripps Institute of 
Oceanography. 

As of May 2010, the 
department faces a $3 
million deficit, accord-
ing to the May 27 UCSD 
Guardian article “Cost 
of Parking Permits May 
Increase.” And now, UCSD’s 
shuttle system could face 
a drastic reduction of 
transportation services or 
possibly a raise in parking permit fees, 
according to former A.S. Undergraduate 
Representative to the Transportation 
Policy Committee Adam Powers. 

According to A.S. President 
Alyssa Wing, A.S. plans to survey 
student interest during winter quar-
ter regarding a potential referendum 
to fund Transportation Services, but 
if not enough interest is shown, a 
Transportation Services referendum will 
likely not show up on the 2012 spring 
ballot. 

Transportation services are not a part 
of tuition fees. According to Powers, rev-

enue from UCSD’s transportation system 
solely comes from parking permits and 
citations. This means students with 
parking permits (who likely don’t use 
the shuttles) are funding shuttle service 
for the students on campus who don’t 
have cars on campus. 

Aside from the possibility of a ref-
erendum (which, if passed, wouldn’t 
be enacted until Fall 2012), the only 

two solutions that 
are being considered 
by Transportation 
Services are raising 
prices or reducing ser-
vices or in the worst 
case scenario, both. 

According to 
Powers, the most cost-
effective method for 
the transportation 
service currently is 
cutting the free MTS 
bus zone. 

MTS buses would 
still come to campus, 
but students would be 
responsible for buying 
their own bus passes 

(which is usually sold for a $72 monthly 
rate  — but if the referendum passes, a 
discounted student bus pass would be 
available for popular UCSD bus routes) 
rather than receiving an annual free bus 
sticker. 

The solution lies in the hands of our 
student body. If students express interest 
in a referendum that would help fund 
Transportation Services, then there is 
the likely possibility that a few extra dol-
lars out of our own pockets could keep 
the shuttles running and keep the MTS 

A TICKET TO RIDE

I can feel it in the air now. Halloween’s tight-skirt, candy-drenched excess is finally over 
and it’s on to bigger, better things. 
The holidays are here, as is everything 

wonderful that goes along with it: 
marshmallow-topped candied yams, 
coping-bourbon, family and friends. 
But the best day of the year isn’t 
Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Christmas 
Day or even Boxing Day (Sorry, I’m 
Canadian). It’s Black Friday.

You can love it or you can hate 
it, but either way you can’t help but 
marvel at Black Friday’s absurdity. It’s 
the biggest shopping day of the year, 
the day when good deals and name 
brands mix to form a critical mass of 
discounts. It is, as the name suggests, 
the day that every struggling store can 
expect to be put in the “black.” Every 
year, you hear stories about people 
smushed against Walmart’s glass 
doors. If that’s not the most depressing 
way to go, I don’t know what is. 

It’s competition at its very worst (a 
close second is Comic-Con freebies), 
and I love every minute of it. Every 
year, my dad and I wake up at the 
ungodly-but-still-not-early-enough 
hour of 3 a.m. and  hustle over to Best 
Buy, where a line has already snaked 
around the building 1 ½ times.

The most tragicomic point of the 
night is not arriving at the line, or 
even walking past the procession of 
half-awake shoppers. It’s the walk into 
the store — slowly shuffling your way 
forward past small heaps of empty 
Red Bull cans and Starbucks cups, 
half-eaten snacks and balled up blan-
kets that people left behind in their 
haste to get inside. Only then do you 
realize how long people have actually 
spent in line. 

But before you can reflect on the 
priorities of humanity, you’re in the 
store and it’s a mad dash to the finish.

Some hints to help you survive: 
Thoroughly research days in advance. 
Websites like bfads.net leak store ads 
almost a week prior to Black Friday, 
so whether you’re looking for a new 
laptop or a cheap set of kitchen appli-
ances, it’s all online. 

Plan your shopping around one 
or two stores. Typically, my family 
starts out at Best Buy and moves on 
to Target later in the day. Though the 
Target doorbusters like their freak-
ishly popular $5 toasters may be long 
gone, they still have an extensive, jaw-
droppingly cheap selection of DVDs. 
The bottom line: Start with the store 
where you plan on buying the most, 
and then move on from there.

Once you’re in the stores them-
selves, shopping strategies vary 
depending on what you want. If you 
are determined to get a big-ticket item 
like a TV or a laptop, obviously run 
there first. Claim it, and never let go 
of it until you leave the store. If your 
group is there to land deals on smaller 
items like DVDs or computer accesso-
ries, assign roles to each person before 
heading in the store.

It doesn’t really matter how you 
feel about Black Friday — you really 
can’t ignore it. Embrace it. Embrace 
America. I’ll see you all in line.

bus zone free, according to Powers. 
But it’s not like they haven’t tried this before. A $25 

per quarter fee transportation referendum was pro-
posed (and failed) in 2010. 

Wing says that this time, A.S. will pursue a new ref-
erendum if enough student interest is shown this time 
around. A.S. would be able to draft a referendum to 
appear on the 2011-12 spring ballot during elections. If 
passed, the referendum would go into effect Fall 2012.

All students currently pay for student enrichment 
resources like UCSD’s athletic facilities and tutoring 
programs through additional tuition fees, approved by 
the student body in past referendums. 

The $2.65 quarterly fee that would fund UCSD’s 
concert venue and bar, The Loft, was struck down by 
A.S. Council in a 15-11 vote in Nov. 2008 according the 

Nov. 17 article in The Guardian titled “Council Strikes 
Loft from Fee Referendum.” But for many students, the 
Loft is a luxury. 

The shuttles, on the other hand, are a form of 
transportation that a significant portion of the student 
population regularly uses. 

Bottom line is that Transportation Services needs 
funds. They have laid out all their cards on the table 
while looking for help from A.S. 

But due to failures of transportation referendums 
past, a new referendum won’t come to fruition without 
strong student support. 

Alternatively, if a referendum is unsuccessful, and 
Transportation Services would subsequently have to 
make drastic cuts, then students would have to accept 
the fact that they will need to fund their own public 
transportation expenditures to leave campus.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
I’ve noticed the news about the 

protests on Wall Street. Listening 
to the points of the protesters, I am 
reminded of the following sayings:

 “Figures don’t lie, but liars 
figure!”  After thinking about the 
Great Depression, I wondered, 
“Who would have benefited from 
everybody ‘losing’ their checking 
and savings accounts?”  Readers 
may compare my theory to the 
President Kennedy assassination 
theories, but I would not be sur-
prised to learn that the rich and 
powerful planned the entire Great 
Depression!

 “Those who don’t learn from 
history are doomed to repeat 
it!”  Our supposed leaders during 
the Vietnam War did not listen to 
the cries of the people to get out 
of Vietnam!  How many thousands 
of lives would have been saved if 
these warmongers had only listened 
to the people?  The current lead-
ers are too stubborn, conservative, 
wimpy and spineless to listen to the 
people they are supposedly repre-
senting!       

 These “gutsy and heroic” pro-
testers are correct in believing our 
government’s choice to bail out large 
financial firms, and then its allow-
ance to let the economic fall-out to 

land squarely on the people!  This 
99% majority versus the 1% ultra-
rich and powerful shows there is an 
extreme gap between the “haves” 
and “have-nots” in America, “the 
measure of what every country 
should strive to be!”

 Our government, “of The 
People, by The People, and for 
The People,” needs to live up to 
the meanings of The Declaration 
of Independence, The U.S. 
Constitution, and the will of the 
American people by making the 
decisions that will make a brighter 
future for ALL AMERICANS!

 The question I will pose is this: 
Is it fair, the American Ideal, and 
the quest for a perfect society for the 
rich and powerful to dictate to the 
world’s population by influencing 
the world’s governments with their 
multi-million dollar bribes?  I will 
ask that all people contemplate this.

NicolasÊ
CageÊandÊ
theÊBurdenÊ
of ÊGenius

I t started as joke. Weary of the predict-able Halloween movie night fare, a few friends and I took a tip from a popular 
“Best of Nicolas Cage” viral video and 
rented “Vampire’s Kiss” — a little-known 

1988 vampire dramedy starring Cage and 
a host of low-profile supporting actors. 
Having already seen a particularly outra-
geous scene wherein Cage’s character 
screams the entire alphabet at his thera-
pist, I thought the film would provide 
a few hours of entertaining fodder on 
par with the infamously dreadful 2006 
remake of “The Wicker Man.”

I was wrong. Instead, “Vampire’s Kiss” 
instantly pushed its way up my list of 
favorite films, initiating my current obses-
sion with the uncompromising genius 
that is Nicolas Cage.

After witnessing a drawn-out montage 
of a hysterical Cage waving his govern-
ment-issue firearm at schoolchildren and 
escorting a helpless woman off her bicycle 
at gunpoint (one of “The Wicker Man”’s 
many meme-friendly gems), you’d be 
forgiven for wondering if the guy has ever 
turned down a role. Forgiven, but wrong. 
Cage’s creative process runs deceptively 
deep. 

“Initially what I was attracted to was 
the idea that I was going to get my eye 
shot out,” Cage told Screen Junkies of his 
role in last year’s ultra-violent, ultra-sexist 
exploitation-inspired “Drive Angry.” Then 
he added, “I like horror, science fiction 
because I can get avant-garde with those 
performances.”

In the interview, he continued to 
describe the time he broke 180 MPH 
on his motorcycle, the influence of 
Walt Whitman’s “Leaves of Grass” on 
his performance in “Drive Angry” and 
intentionally cutting his Copolla fam-
ily ties (He took his name from influ-
ential experimental composer John 
Cage). Topics varied, but the main idea 
remained: Nicolas Cage is no dweeby 
B-actor, and rules are meant to be broken.

While even the most die-hard Cage 
fanatic would have difficulty arguing 
“Ghost Rider 2: Spirit of Vengeance”’s 
vital significance in modern art, the 
actor’s more captivating moments (and 
there are plenty) are too often overlooked. 
His performance as all-American anti-
hero Sailor Ripley in David Lynch’s clas-
sic “Wild at Heart” was subtly brilliant 
— with Cage himself allegedly providing 
his character’s iconic snakeskin jacket — 
and that more people haven’t witnessed 
his coke-snorting, iguana-hallucinating, 
elderly woman-suffocating Detective 
Terrence McDonagh in Werner Herzog’s 
severely underrated “Bad Lieutenant: 
Port of Call New Orleans” is a downright 
tragedy.

But even Cage’s so-called “bad” films 
are clearly just as fascinating, with videos 
like “Nicolas Cage Losing His Shit” and 
(my personal favorite) “The Evolution 
of Nicolas Cage’s Hair” racking millions 
of views on YouTube. And after you’ve 
pocketed an Oscar and been regularly 
hailed by Roger Ebert as one of the great-
est actors of all time, what reason could 
you possibly have not to become a 
Harley-riding vigilante of the night with a

SENIOR STAFF WRITER

I
f you’re unsure whether or not John Cho is 
messing with you, that probably means he is. 
The 39-year-old actor is a master of deadpan; 
even the most implausible lies are delivered 

with such perfect seriousness that, for a moment, 
you’re taken in. 

Take the first question in an interview with 
the Guardian: Is Cho surprised that, having gone 
to White Castle in 2004 and Guantanamo Bay 
in 2008, we’re sitting here talking about a third 
“Harold & Kumar” movie? 

He doesn’t miss a beat.
“God told me there would be 12,” he intones 

gravely, staring at the ceiling.
But Cho — who played Harold Lee in “Harold 

& Kumar” and Hikaru Sulu in the “Star Trek” 
reboot, and popularized the term “MILF” in 
“American Pie” — has always been a smart aleck.

“I was born in Korea, lived there until I was 6,” 
Cho said. “Then we moved to America and our 
first Christmas here, my mom and dad tried to do 
it the American way, you know, with Santa Claus. 
It didn’t work because they wrapped our presents 
in a Hoover vacuum box, and we had just bought 
a Hoover vacuum. So I said to my parents, ‘What’s 
with the charade?’”

He pronounces it “sher-ahd,” dragging out the 
“a” sound. 

“[My parents] said, ‘What’s a charade? And 
why are you pronouncing it so weird?’”

This year, for the very first time, Cho and his 
wife are buying into the tradition so their son can 
grow up listening for reindeer and addressing 
wish lists to the North Pole. How old is Cho’s kid?

“14.”
His publicists laugh, seeing that he’s scored a 

hit. His son is actually three.
“Harold & Kumar go to White Castle” seemed 

unlikely to launch a franchise. It was an unapolo-
getically raunchy stoner flick written by two 
unknowns, starring an Asian-American and an 
Indian-American. It also dealt with racial stereo-
types in an unself-conscious way guaranteed to 
make the politically correct squirm.

“I’m more surprised than anyone that we’re sit-

ting here talking about the third movie,” Cho said. 
“I didn’t think that the first one would get made, 
after I read the script. After I was cast, I didn’t 
believe it would get made, and during rehearsal 
I wasn’t sure there would be cameras when we 
showed up.”

But now Harold and Kumar have returned 
for “A Very Harold and Kumar 3-D Christmas,” 
set six years after the first two flicks. Harold and 
Kumar have grown apart; Harold is a successful 
businessman, drug-free, married to the girl of his 
dreams and trying to start a family. Kumar, on 
the other hand, lives in a permanent cloud of pot 
smoke in the grungy apartment he once shared 
with Harold. The two haven’t spoken for years.

Although they are no longer dealing with the 
college-relatable hassles of grad school applica-
tions and bottom-rung jobs, Cho said the movie 
is still relevant to its core audience.

“It’s still college humor, first of all,” he said. 
“And also, when you’re in college you make these 
incredibly tight friendships, either with people 
that you lived with or people that shared your 
major. And after college, you know, it seems 
impossible, but you start to drift apart, and you 
sit there thinking, ‘How is this possible? I was so 
close to you, and now it feels like I don’t know you 
at all.’ And that’s something that I think college 
kids can draw parallels with.”

Luckily, Christmas magic brings the two back 

together for the same brand of madcap, drug-
addled adventures that characterized the first 
two films. It’s an early holiday release — the film 
comes out Nov. 4, pre-empting Thanksgiving and 
barely passing Halloween.

“I have no idea why we’re releasing it so soon,” 
Cho said, turning to his publicists. “Do you guys 
know?”

“No. But they’re already selling Christmas 

wrapping paper at Costco,” his publicist answered 
from across the room.

“If it’s good enough for Costco then it’s good 
enough for me,” Cho said. “Why are you ques-
tioning it? This is my early holiday gift to you col-
lege kids; just appreciate it. God.”

In a series known for being visually ridiculous 
(The first flick featured a ride on a cheetah’s back 
and Kumar making love to a giant anthropomor-
phic bag of pot), the third movie sets a new stan-
dard. 3-D effects aside, it runs a visual gauntlet 
with Claymation scenes, slow-mo shootouts with 
Russian gangsters and a big Christmas musical 
number starring Neil Patrick Harris.

“[The musical] was the most fun to do,” Cho 
said. “It was the most incredible homage to the 
old Hollywood ones. If you ever get the chance 
to do a musical with Neil Patrick Harris — if you 
ever get that chance — just take it.”

Cho will have a big year in 2012, when he’ll 
appear in the next “Star Trek” movie, the remake 
of “Total Recall” and “American Pie: Reunion.” As 
for Harold and Kumar, now that they’ve defied 
expectations and made it to movie number three, 
there could be more down the line.

“I wouldn’t mind doing one,” Cho said. “It’s 
been suggested that they go to Comic-Con. 
Harold and Kumar could go to the United 
Nations. Harold and Kumar could go to the free 
health clinic. ‘Harold & Kumar Get Diabetes’.”

flaming skull for a head? 
Cage operates within a distinctive 

school of acting known as Nouveau 
Shamanic, which takes influence 
from pre-Christian actors who also 
served as town shamans, channel-
ing answers from their imaginations 
and another parallel dimension. Yes, 
of course Cage fucking invented it, 
which explains why he’s so good at it. 
Whether or not you’re convinced he 
is indeed a living legend of the craft, 
no one does crazy like Nicolas Cage. 
But unlike the crack-fueled antics of 
the considerably less talented Charlie 
Sheen, there’s something so lovably 
pure about Nicolas Cage’s particular 
brand of insanity. 

Which brings us back to 
“Vampire’s Kiss.” The film starts off 
as a bizarre rom-com packed with 
seemingly unintentional surreal-
ism: Cage’s outrageously inconsistent 
accent that struggles between British 
scholar and ’90s movie surfer dude, 
his unprovoked hatred of his secretary 
and an uncomfortably erotic encoun-

ter with a vampire bat. But then the 
film changes gears, transforming into 
a smart, darkly comic psychological 
drama with a crazier-than-ever Cage 
at its inventive center. Cage’s over-the-
top madness is simultaneously hilari-
ous and chilling, rivaling such classic 
on-screen lunatics as Jack Nicholson’s 
Jack Torrance and Heath Ledger’s 
Joker.  How “Vampire’s Kiss” isn’t yet a 
celebrated cult classic I’ll never know, 
but it has certainly become a new 
Halloween tradition. 

But alas, Cage has yet to find the 
universal acclaim he deserves. Like 
the under-appreciated Kafkas and Van 
Goghs of old, perhaps the actor was 
simply meant for another time. 

More specifically, 1861, says an 
eBay user from Seattle with a Civil 
War-era carte de visite depicting a 
convincing Cage doppelganger. The 
photograph has recently become 
an Internet phenomenon and, to 
some, proof of Cage’s mysteri-
ous extra-dimensional knowledge. 
Unconvinced? Google “Nic Cage 
19th century vampire” and decide for 
yourself.

ALBUM REVIEWS

E nigmatic Deerhunter frontman Bradford Cox staked his claim in pierc-
ing art-punk in 2007 with 
the band’s sophomore release 
Cryptograms. Since then, Cox 
has progressively turned toward 
cleaner, more cohesive songwrit-
ing. And on Parallax, Cox’s first 

release since Deerhunter’s stun-
ning Halcyon Digest and third 
release under his solo moniker 
Atlas Sound, the focus continues 
to pay off.

Album opener “The Shakes” 
wastes little time with its tight, 
motorik drum rhythm and hyp-
notic shoegaze chorus. It’s famil-
iar territory, sounding more like 
a Halcyon b-side than anything 
from Cox’s ambient-heavy solo 
catalogue — all while working as 
a fantastic transition into Atlas 
Sound’s exploration of sleeker 
production and vocals.

Cox’s newfound confidence in 
his vocal range is evident on the 
album, especially when his crisp, 
untouched singing lifts, rather 

than supports, the album’s subtle 
chord progressions and intricate 
harmonies.

Take “Te Amo,” which has 
Cox impressively channeling 
Bjork’s sweeping wails over deli-
cate, cascading piano loops. It’s 
a daring move for a songwriter 
who used to drown himself in 
distortion — and one of his best 
vocal performances yet.

On “Mona Lisa,” the most 
cheerful track on the album, 
Cox even gets downright poppy. 
(Well, for him). Upbeat drums 
are layered over acoustic guitar, 
as Cox’s Zombies-influenced 
vocal harmonies effortlessly 
deliver his signature stream-of-
consciousness lyrics.  

Bowie-inspired love ballad 
“Modern Aquatic Nightsongs” 
finds Cox at his most vulnerable. 
“Is your love worth the nausea it 
could bring / Is your love worth 
those you left hurting,” he croons. 
The sentiment is almost juvenile 
in its simplicity but, more impor-
tantly, it is brave and achingly 
sincere. 

Cox is still no showman — 
he’ll probably always be the guy 
with his hands in his pockets 
and eyes turned down towards 
his Converse — but now he’s at 
least confident enough to raise 
his voice.

D espite having reached out into so many different art forms, David Lynch has 
kept his style remarkably consis-
tent. His brand of nightmare sur-
realism is just as evident in clas-

sic films like “Mulholland Drive” 
as it is in his “Dumbland” flash 
animations or his vocal work 
on the Sparklehorse and Danger 
Mouse collaboration “Dark Night 
of the Soul.” And the auteur’s 
latest musical experiment, Crazy 
Clown Time, is no exception. 

Though best known for his 
work as a director, Lynch is no 
stranger to recorded sound, 
working closely with composer 
Angelo Badalamenti to score 
most of his films. And like many 
of Badalamenti’s scores, Crazy 
Clown Time is synth-heavy and 
stripped down, leaving stark, 

reverberating drum beats and 
sparse synth string flourishes to 
comprise the bulk of the album’s 
sound.

Lynch — his voice disguised 
by an array of eerie filters — 
half-sings, half-reads his grave, 
unsettling poems, which mostly 
take the form of surreal short 
stories. There’s a distressed driver 
going too fast in opener “Pinky’s 
Dream,” a nightmarish backyard 
party in the title track — but the 
lyrics are vague and often with-
out context (“I’m gonna make 
that call,” “I’ve got a truck and 
a single bed / Got a stone and a 

table painted red”).
Lynch doesn’t rush these 

songs either, with only one track 
under four minutes and the 
album as a whole clocking in at 
over an hour long. 

But the tracks are lacking 
without the visuals. And even 
though Crazy Clown Time is 
filled with shadowy promise, it’s 
difficult not to wish Lynch would 
aim his focus back toward cin-
ema where he’s been so desper-
ately missed.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 3,  2011 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG 11

Tritons finish conference play with 39 points — six 
points in front of No. 2 CSU Los Angeles. 

The Tritons were the first of the four teams to 
guarantee their spot in the conference championships, 
winning a postseason berth last week after defeating 
Sonoma State. They will be joined by South Division 
team CSU Los Angeles as well as North Division 
representatives Chico State and CSU Stanislaus, who 

snubbed Sonoma State for the last spot.
“We want to do well this weekend, but we’re still 

always looking to peak in the [national tournament],” 
Armstrong said.

Top-seeded UCSD will head to Turlock to face off 
against fourth-seeded CSU Stanislaus on Friday, Nov. 
4. The winner will play in the final against the winner 
of the Chico State-CSU Los Angeles match.

Competition, with the Tritons’ first boat clocking in 
just after USD, and the second boat coming in just 
20 seconds later. 

“Overall I think we did really well,” varsity eight 
rower Ashley Travaglione said. “It’s our first race of 
the season and things felt really good in the boat. 
And both varsity boats rowed faster than last year.” 

The men’s team, who is consistently competitive 
at the national level, easily took first place in both 
the varsity and novice divisions.

Both the men’s and women’s teams will compete 
in the Head of the Marina event this Saturday, Nov. 
5 and the Newport Harbor Rowing Festival on Nov. 
6.

“I was really happy with the performance despite 
the number of illnesses and injuries on our team,” 
varsity eight rower Alyssa Dixon-Word said. “We 
are very excited about this upcoming weekend and 
hope to show how competitive our team is this year.”

Your future never looked brighter.

on the bench, Wolfrom took the shot and 
sent a clinical finish to the right corner.

UCSD would finish the Gators off by 
scoring two more — both off assists by 
Wolfrom.

“We did well to fight back,” Bucchere 
said. “We went a goal down and then our 
offense kind of exploded in the way that it’s 
capable of doing.”

In their last game of the season on 
Sunday, the Tritons beat Cal Poly Pomona 
1-0.

The win lifted UCSD above Pomona 
in the conference standings, lifting the 
team to No. 3 in the South Division. 
    Against Cal Poly Pomona, the lone goal 
came in the 39th minute, when Haroush 
cracked a shot that deflected off the frame. 
Wolfrom hustled down the flank, but was 
dragged down by a Pomona defender and 
awarded a penalty-kick. Again, Wolfrom 
stepped up and buried the ball past 
Pomona goalkeeper Anthony Iniguez.

Up 1-0, the Tritons managed to hold 
onto the lead despite being out-shot by the 
Broncos 10-13. Brennan proved critical for 
the Tritons in the net, making five saves.

“It was a complete performance,” 
Bucchere said. “In the attack and in the 
defense, it was a total team effort, and a 
great win for us.”

Unfortunately, the Tritons’ four con-
secutive wins weren’t enough to claim the 

fourth seed. In order for UCSD to advance, 
Sonoma and Cal State Stanislaus both need-
ed to drop their Sunday games. Sonoma fell 
to Chico State 0-1, but Stanislaus managed 
to sneak past Humboldt 1-0 for a place in 
the conference tournament.

But the Tritons can take consolation 
in a few aspects of the 2011 campaign — 
specifically, the youth of the group and the 
clear progress in the rebuilding process. 

With only three or four upperclassmen 
starting regularly, the Tritons fared well 
for a relatively young squad. And even 
with an up-and-down season, the core 
group proved resilient, with some sur-
prising assets that will only improve over 
time. Sophomores Wolfrom — named the 
CCAA Player of the Week after his two-
goal weekend — and Arsht both earned 
all-CCAA honors. 

Despite graduating seniors who stood 
as fixtures for the program for three or four 
years, the Tritons have rebuilded well, still 
managing a winning record: 10-8-0 overall 
and 9-7-0 in the CCAA. 

“Throughout the season, what has let 
us down was our consistency.” Bucchere 
said. “But with all of our team back next 
year, I think we can look at this as a lesson 
for next season and hopefully we can find 
more of a consistent rhythm and make a 
run at the playoffs.”

Tritons Finish Season on High NoteUCSD Fencing Kicks Off  Season
By Nicholas Howe
Associate Sports Editor

    
FENCING — This weekend the Triton Fencing 
team started its season in style, showing good 
form at the 16th annual Blade Runner tournament 
hosted by UCSD. 

  The Triton’s fencing program is one of 
the top in the nation, as the team has accu-
mulated seven titles in the Intercollegiate 
Fencing Conference of Southern California.  
       Over the weekend, several Tritons had good 
showings in the foil event. The foil is a competi-
tion in which the lightest of the three types of 
fencing weapons is used and points are only scored 
if a thrust hits an opponent in the waist or neck. 
UCSD senior Michael Fong won the foil, while 
freshman Jeffrey Chan also had a good perfor-
mance, finishing 13th in the same competition.  
       In the final for the women’s foil, two Tritons 

dueled for gold and silver, with senior Julia 
Wu outmaneuvering sophomore Julie Forcier. 
    An epee is a slightly heavier weapon than the foil 
and can score points with a thrust to any part of the 
body. Freshman Adam Campbell-Kruger fought 
his way to ninth place on the men’s side.   
UCSD sophomore Luke Ginestat finished 19th. 
    The sabre is the most menacing and heaviest of 
the three fencing weapons, perhaps eliciting the 
most excitement since cutting blows can garner 
points — as well as welts and bruises. 

     In the sabre event, sophomore Nic Bartuzik led 
the Triton men in sixth place. On the women’s side, 
sophomore Munira Gesner slashed her way to third. 
       Overall, the Tritons recorded a good start to a 
promising season. UCSD will now head to Irvine 
on Sunday for the Collegiate Open.

TOP OF THE CONFERENCE

The No. 7 UCSD women’s soccer team finished off its regular season this weekend with two more wins at home, beating San Francisco 
State 1-0 and Cal Poly Pomona 2-0.

Last year’s conference champion, San 
Francisco State — who has an 8-8-2 overall 
record this year — came out strong against 
the Tritons on Friday. With the season on the 
line, the normally defensive-minded squad 
pushed to attack.

“We had a little trouble playing the way 
that we usually do in the first half,” senior 
goalkeeper Kristin Armstrong said. “We 
needed to just get the ball on the ground and 
play around them.”

The Tritons still managed to outshoot the 
Gators 6-3 in the first half, but San Francisco 
goalkeeper Annicia Jones — whose perfor-
mance in the net led the Gators to last year’s 
conference championship — did well to deny 
UCSD.

With the score drawn 0-0 at the end of 
the half, UCSD regrouped in the second half.

“[Head coach Brian McManus] wasn’t 
too happy with our first half,” Armstrong 
said. “But we were able to calm ourselves 
down and move the ball around, and we 
were able to get the goal from there.”

The Tritons recorded 16 shots to the 
Gators’ three in the second half. But much to 
Jones’ credit, San Francisco shut UCSD out 
until the 69th minute.

The Tritons nearly took the lead in the 
68th minute, when junior midfielder Jessica 
Wi was brought down in the 18-yard box for 
a penalty kick. Junior defender Ellen Wilson 
stepped up to take the kick, shooting low to 
the left corner, but Jones made the diving 
save.

“It would have been easy to get our 
heads down after that,” Armstrong said. 
“[San Francisco] beat us in penalty kicks last 
year. But it was really big for us that Wi was 
able to put it away.”

Just over a minute later, junior defender 
Hayley Johnson took a shot that deflected 
off the crossbar, and Wi was there to capital-

ize. Dribbling inside the box, Wi took a shot 
from the far right that found its way past the 
San Francisco goalkeeper.

UCSD cruised to the 1-0 lead, with the 
Triton defense shutting out the Gator attack.

Recently named the No. 1 backline in 
the nation, the Triton defense — sweeper 
Wilson, right-back senior Sara Spaventa, 
left-back Johnson and Armstrong in the net 
— have recorded the lowest goals-against 
percentage in the country. The four, who 
have played in the back together for the past 
three seasons, registered their 10th shutout 
with the win.

On Sunday, the Tritons capped their 
regular season with a 2-0 win against Cal 
Poly Pomona. In its home game, UCSD hon-
ored nine graduating seniors: Armstrong, 
Spaventa, Annie Wethe, Sarah McTigue, 
Shelby Wong, Courtney Capobianco, 
Lindsey Mills, Katie Kuykendall and Sarah 
Garland.

Again, the Tritons had a difficult time in 
the first half.

“I wouldn’t say that we played poorly in 
the first half,” Armstrong said. “But it was 
kind of like we were weathering the storm. 
Our defense kept us in the game before we 
were able to get on the board.”

Much to Pomona’s credit, the Broncos 
managed to outshoot the Tritons in the first 
half, 6-5. But UCSD finally found the net in 
the second half. 

In the 49th minute, Johnson sent a corner 
kick in from the left side. The ball slipped 
through to the back post. Freshman Cassie 
Callahan made a run down the right flank, 
chasing down the ball to send a cross to 
junior forward Gabi Hernandez, who fin-
ished past the Pomona goalkeeper.

Armstrong did well to keep the net clean 
for UCSD, recording seven saves in the cam-
paign before the Tritons sealed the win with 
a goal from sophomore Izzy Pozurama in the 
82nd minute.

MEN’S SOCCER — The UCSD men’s soccer team ended its 
season with an inspired four-game winning streak, finishing 
just two points away from the conference championships

After losing its previous four games three weeks ago, 
UCSD was on the outside looking in as it dropped to No. 
4 in the very competitive South Division. With five schools 
all virtually tied in the standings, it seemed a long shot for 
UCSD to break into the top four. But with Sonoma falter-

ing down the home stretch, losing and tying their last four 
matches, the Seawolves opened a window for the Tritons to 
sneak into the last seed.

“When you end on such a good note like what we did, 
it’s hard to be upset,” assistant coach Eric Bucchere said. 
“But I’m sure once we look back on it, we’ll be a little disap-
pointed. I think if we would have found a little more of a 
consistent rhythm throughout the year it would have been 
enough to get us into the playoffs.”

Needing wins in their last two games for a shot at 
qualification, UCSD came out fired up on Friday. However, 
the Tritons fell into the familiar pattern of conceding the 
first goal, when in the ninth minute, San Francisco’s Edgar 
Villagrana picked off a pass sophomore defender Andrew 
Keimach intended for sophomore forward Tsuk Haroush. 
Threading through the Triton midfield, Villagrana got 
around UCSD’s last defender, sophomore Gavin Lamming 
to put the Gators up 1-0.

The Tritons rallied to cut the deficit. Head coach Jon 
Pascale, who has worked with his substitutions well this 
season, made the call to replace sophomores Sam Ball and 
Andisheh Bagheri for juniors Adam Zernik and Jordan 
Valenciano.

The change paid off just two minutes later. Zernik con-
nected with sophomore midfielder Cory Wolfrom down the 
right side, who cut it back to Valenciano near the penalty 
area. Valenciano collected himself and sent a curved ball 
into the side netting to bring the score to 1-1.

UCSD took the lead early in the second half, when soph-
omore defender Alec Arsht was pulled down in Sonoma’s 
18-yard box to win a penalty-kick for the Tritons. With the 
team’s usual penalty-taker, junior midfielder Alex Portela,
