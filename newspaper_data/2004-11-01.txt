Dynes approves $7.2 tnillion plan 
to level, rebuild University House 

~ WDncICiuanfan 
Construdion scene: Following an advisory recommendation, UC President 
Robert C. Dynes approved raising $7.2 million to rebuild University House. 

By BENJAMIN BAmETT 
Staff Writer 

UC President Robert C. Dynes 
has approved a plan to raise an esti-
mated 57.2 million to destroy and 
rebuild University House, which 
serves as a residence for the UCSD 
chancellor. The decision, however, 
has raised concerns over the cost 
and archaeological impact of such 
construction. 

Dynes made the decision after 
an advisory committee evaluating 
the condition of the estate recom-
mended that the house be 
destroyed and rebuilt. 

"There were two viable options: 
restore the existing structure, whkh 
would be horrendously expensive, 
or rebuild the house," said 
Anthropology professor Donald 
Turin, who served on the advisory 
c_si.u,.. 

According to Tuzin, attempting 
to restore the existing structure 
would have only led to further 
problems in the future. 

"Considering the condition of 
the electrical or heating, God 
!mows what we would have been 
facing," he said. 

The UC Office of the President 
has pledged at least 5] million for 
the reconstruction, while the rest of 
the funds are to be raised by the 
university from private entities. 

"We are raising the funds pri-
vately so we don't take money away

Language program 
faces possible cuts 

By CHARLES NGUYEN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD Heritage 
Language Program is in financial 
danger because of university bud-
getary issues and could be cut 
midway through the year, accord-
ing to Robert Kluender, chair of 
the linguistics deparnnent. 

"At this point, we don't have 
enough money to get through the 
year," he said. "Every year we have 
a bit of trouble, but this one is 
especially hard." 

The program began in 200], 
when a graduate studeqt started 
an informal Armenian language 
class, which quiclcly gained popu-
larity. . 

This unplanned beginning 
precluded any long-term finan-
cial planning for the Heritage 
Language Program according to 
Kluender. He also said university 
budget cuts pose an additional 
burden for the program. 

The program is geared toward 
-heritage speakers," which 
Kluender defined as -those who 

were exposed to their native lan-
guage in childhood but became 
dominant in English later in life." 

"There seemed to be quite a 
response initially," Kluender said. 
"In response to that, we tried to 
add on more languages to the pro-
gram." 

The strongest interest in the 
program comes from students 
whose speaking ability doesn't 
reach their comprehension level of 
their native language, according to 
Kluender. 

It includes Persian, Armenian, 
Korean, Tagalog and Vietnamese 
languages. Arabic had been offered 
previously, but was not included 
this fall. 

"The program really serves stu-
dents that want to mow more of 
their native language," Vietnamese 
American Youth Alliance 
Committee chair Tri Nguyen said. 
"It builds on the foundation that 
you already have of your lan-
guage."

Budget plan restores 
partial EAOP funds 

ByUSAMAK 
Associate News Editor 

With an original propo al cut-
ting Early Academic Outreach 
Program funding by more than 80 
percent while allocating an addi-
tional 5200,000 to Preuss School 
rejected by the UC Office of the 
President, Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Joseph W. Watson 
last week submitted a revised and 
final outreach budget plan. The 
new budget will give EAOP 
approximately $630,000 and cut 
Preuss School funding by 
$30,000. 

"We're working quite hard to 
try to get adequate funding for as 
many programs as possible, and one 
of the unfortunate aspectS of the 
public discussion is that it's pitted 
one program against another, rather 
than emphasizing our efforts to get 

additional money," Watson said. 
The original propo al ubmit-

ted to UCOP had allocated 
$250,000 to EAOP, less than 20 
percent of the program's $1.5 bil-
lion budget last year. The new pro-
posal allocates $380,000 to the pro-
gram, with additional money com-
ing from temporary campus fund-
ing for a final working budget of 
roughly $630,000, according to 
WatSon. 

Most other EAOP'programs on 
UC campuses were allocated 
approximately $700,000 for the 
year, according to Student 
Affirmative Action Committee 
chair Emily Leach. 

"The money is till a little less 
than other campuses are receiving, 
but it's still wonderful and a great 
improvement over the $250,000

UC announces settlement in 

third Enron case 
The University of Califomia has reached a 

$225.5 million settlement with investment bank-
ing company Lehman Brothers for its role in 
underwriting millions of dollars of Enron Corp. 
secunbes. 

A class action lawsuit by investors - in 
which the university served as the lead plaintiff 
- charged the company of violating securities 
laws that make undelWnters liable for misstate-
ments in official documents of corporations 
whose debt they back. 

-ry,e settlement is third in a string of UC suits 
dealing With the now-bankrupt energy giant, in 
w~l~h the university had invested. In July, UC 
offiCials announced a $69 million settlement 
with Bank of America in a similar suit. In addi-
tion! a year earlier, the university reached a $40 
million settlement with the international 
umbrella organization of accounting firm Arthur 
Andersen, which served as Enron's auditor. 

The university is also participating in law-
, suits against banking giants J.P. Morgan Chase 

Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank and 
others on similar grounds. 

'These banks set up false investments in clan· 
destine~ controlled Enron partnerships, used off· 
shore companies to disguise loans and facilitated 
the phone sale of phantom Enron assets," the 
university stated in written documents. 

Researcher: Investments 
i.nfluenced research funds 

Philip Morris threatened leading medical 
schools With the loss of research funding, 
offering grants .as inc~nt~ve to keep institu· 
tIOns from seiling their Investments in the 
tobacco conglomerate's stock, a new report 
from a UC San Francisco researcher has 
charged. 

The findings, published in the November issue 
of the joumal Academic Medicine, are based on 
secret internal tobacco industry documents 
acquired through litigation, according to Ruth 
Malone, the report's author and associate profes-
sor at UC San Francisco's School of Nursing. 

The company used its investments in acado 
emic research to pressure major universities to 
refrain from ~ ivesting their stock holdings, 
Malone stated In the report. 

In addition, the industry used its support for 
research as a way "to buy legitimacy" and "to 
counter the image of harm caused by ciga-
rettes: according to Ma!one and research asso· 
ciate Nathaniel Wander. 

In the 1980s, health and social welfare 
organizations like the American Medical 
Association withdrew their tobacco holdings 
and urged medical schools and parent univer· 

sities to do the same. 
The University of California divested its 

holdings in 200 1 and recent votes by faculty at 
some UC campuses adopted rules against 
acceptance of tobacco industry research fund-
ing. according to Malone. 

As of AuWJs~ at least five of the 12 top-
ranked medical schools In the country main-
tained their financial investments in the indus-
try, Malone stated. 

Company launches new PlP 
softWare aimed at students 
Mill Valley-based company Grouper has 

launched new peer-ta-peer software, targeted 
at college students, that it argues allows groups 
to lawful~ share music. 

Its programs allow groups of up to 30 to 
stream media files on personal computers, the 
company stated. Unlike other P2P software, the 
company has said that its internal player is law-
ful because it allows users to listen to files 
store.d on friends' computers without actually 
copYIng them, replicating physical 'ending" of 
music stored on tangible media. 

Grouper believes that the software can be 
used by students as 'a practical tool" to form 
virt~al study groups, allow pr~fessors to digitaJ· 
Iy dlstnbute classroom matenals and save uni-
versity network administrators money by 
decreasing Intemet bandwidth costs, because 
the program transfers files between machines 
on Iocar networks, the company stated. 

Other P2P providers have come under legal 
pressure from the Recording Industry 
AsSOCiation of America, which has launched 
lawsu.its against ind!viduals accu.sed of violating 
copynght laws by Illegally shanng music. The 

grou~ has .also served subpoenas to universi· 
ties, Including UCLA, demanding identities of 
students using its network to download illegal 
mUSIc. 

Environmental grades 
mixed on report card 

Though scientists have made 'dramatic 
improvements" in measuring exposure to a 
range of unhealthy air pollutants, Southern 
California scores "poorly" in its attempts to 
reduce traffic congestion, an annual study by 
UCLA's Institute of the Environment has found. 

In the repo~ UCLA's urban planning experts 
argued that regional planners in Los Angeles 
should focus on improving bus service to 
reduce congestion, instead of building roads 
and rail transit lines or encouraging use of car· 
pool lanes. In addition, the ref0rt cited evi· 
dence of 'an onslauRht of illega dumping and 
unauthorized landfill operations' on the 
region's Native American reservations.

House: Price for construction of new 'palace' unjustified, union says

from any other source," Vice 
Chancellor of External Relations 
James M. Langley said. "We have 
to take action, and it's better not to 
take funds out of the UC [sys-
tem)." 

However, with the university 
facing a state budget crunch, mem-
bers of the university'S clerical union 
have expressed concern over the 
estimated cost of reconstruction. 

"It's elitist," said Denise Mitchell· 
Carignan, vice president of the 
Coalition of University Employees. 
"[The chancellor] is a public official 
at a public university .. . and should 
not be asking for special treatment 
over any other public official." 

According to Tuzin, the chan-
cellor has no say in the matter. 

"It is a recommendation made 
by the president," he said. 

Proponents of reconstruction 
have said that it will also provide a 
source of community fundraising 
and cohesion. 

"The function is above and 
beyond that of the chancellor," 
Langley said. "It is used for the 
entenainment of VIPs, it's central 
to raising funds and key for the 
business community .... That's why 
private donors would be interested 
[in contributing]. n 

However, Carignan said she 
remained concerned over its cost 
and emphasis. 

"Why do we need a palace to 
raise funds?" she said. "The 
American Heart Association doesn't. 
... [The University of California] has 
lots of other places where fundrais-
ing could take pl~ce." 

A second consideration in 
rebuilding the house is that the 
property has been identified as an 
important archaeological site. 
Several prior excavations have 
unearthed some of the oldest human 

burial remains in the San Diego 
coast, and further construction could 
damage or contaminate the site. 

"[The remains] go back 8,000 or 
9,000 years and reBect some of the 
earliest male ... inhabitants on the 
coast," UCSD paleobiologist Pat 
Masters said. "These situations 
require careful study and follow-up." 

The construction will take the 
sensitivity of the location into 
account, according to Tuzin. 

"It's a major archeological site -
no doubt it's important," Tuzin said. 
"It's a matter of following state law; 
if there were extensive archeological 
remains, it would take more money 
and more time [for construction)."

ELECTION 2004: 
IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT 

John Kerry for President 
Voter turnout esp'ecially important given narrow race 
W hen President George W. Bush took office in 2000 

- albeit under still-con-
tested circumstances and with less 
than half of the popular vote -
Republicans rejoiced and 
Democrats turned their collective 
wrath on "spoiler" Ralph Nader. 
Few from either party could have 
predicted, however, how Bush 
would turn this narrowest of victo-
ries into a mandate for the most 
polarizing, regressive and socially 
conservative presidency in decades. 

While the 2000 race was 
marked by similarities between the 
Republican and Democratic con-
tenders, no ambiguity exists this 
year; Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass) is 
the clear choice for president and 
the only candidate with the vision 
and leadership capacity to put the 
country back on track economical-
ly, socially, and perhaps most 
importantly, internationally. 

Given the travails of the last 
four years - tax breaks to the 
wealthy even as jobs are lost 
and government spend-
ing increases; rollbacks 
in environmental regu-
lation and civil liberties; a 
costiy, poorly planned or 
intentionally deceptive war - the 
"anyone but Bush" mantra is 
extremely appealing. However, 
Democrats should be credited for 
selecting John Kerry, who has 
demonstrated strength, intelli-
gence and heartfelt concern for 
education, health care and eco-
nomic justice over the course of his 
campaign, all the while weathering 
baseless and simplistic attacks by 
the Bush political machine. 

Kerry clearly recognizes the obvi-
0us faults in the current "administra-
tion's policies. While parallels of Iraq 
to Vietnam are 
exaggerated, he 
reali zes that the 
administration 
must be honest 
with the 
American people, 

particularly during a time when 
Americans are dying abroad daily. 
He understands that there is much 
more to the terrorist threat than 
what Bush absurdly terms the 
"hatred of freedom," and that 
addressing this global threat requires 
global initiative. He appreciates that 
the United States must strive to 
impl'OYe the quality of life for its own 
citizens - through accessible health 
care, equal-opportunity education, 
the creation of jobs and the protec-
tion of the environment (hued on 
widely accepted, scientifically backed 
information) - especially when it 
strives to do the same abroad. 

The prevailing distrust of and 
lack of respect for Bush among the 
collegiate community is no mere 
coincidence. The college-aged 
generation has an incredible stake 
in this election, evidenced by 
increased voter registration 
among 18- to 24-year-olds. Our 
peers are the ones most likely to 
be killed in Iraq, it is our educa-

tion that suffers from the 
growing debt and reluc- ' 

tance to increase Pell 
grants, and it is we who 

will be left with the 
bill if spending 

and tax fa tes 

rectified. 
No recent president has earned 

the wholesale disrespect of liberals 
that Bush has - not simply because 
of his policies but because of his 
administration's arrogant, "God-
given" take on the presidency and the 
role of the United States in dictating 
the course of the world. nus atti-
tude, combined with the administra-
tion's suspicious proximity to 
big business, has extend-
ed the l.cIc of 
faith in the 
presidency 
outside the 
expected chan-
nels of liberal 
thought. Without 
the national secu-
rity trump card 
that Bush has been 
eager to play, Kerry 
would have no trouble 
winning the election. 

1bis is not to say that 
Kerry is the perfect candi-
date; his pledge not to raise 
taxes for families earning 
less than $200,000 a year 
may be premature, 
his unwillingness to 
back gay mar-
riage is dis-
turbing, 

and he could cert2inly do a better job 
to mobilize the "average Americans" 
he claims to represent than simply 
staging :Iunting trips and gracing the 
cover of Rolling Stone. 

There is much truth, however, to 
his assertion that this election is 
uniquely important for the future of 
the nation and the world - this, 
above all, is the best reason to vote 

fur Kerry. Given Bush's first-
term agenda. it is frighten-

ing to think what type of 
mandate the adminis-
tration might assume 
with .re-election, espe-
cially with civil rights 
debates continuing, 
Supreme Court posi-
tions potentially 
opening and more 
global conflict on the 

horizon. The 
Unite~ States 

needs John 
Kerry.

OPINION 7 

U.S. Se11ate 
Barbara Boxer 

Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) is a 
strong voice for the good guys, an 
undeniable one-two punch with 
Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-
Calif.) and much better than any-
thing the Republicans have to 
offer. Her congressional record 
speaks for itself: Before being 
elected to the Senate in 1993, 
Boxer served in the U.S. H ouse of 

number of people who live here. 
For example, in 2002 she intro-
duced a bill - later refered to as 
the "Boxer Bill" - to protect 
areas of the Los Padres National 
Forest at Big Sur from new log-
ging or recrea tional activities. 
Boxer has vowed to alleviate the 
burden of cleaning up pollution 
that has been placed on taxpayer 

,---."...,.,---, and local communi tie , 

House of Representatives: District 53 

Representatives for 10 
years, establishing 
women's rights, educa-
tion and the environ-
ment as the cornerstones 
of her agenda. She has 
continued to be a force 
in pushing for her beliefs 
and the needs of 
Californians; her oppo-
nent, Bill Jones, has no 
such record. 

instead of keeping the 
responsibility in the 
hands of the polluters 
them elves. Also, with 
an eye on renewable 
so urces of energy, 
Boxer has opposed an 
energy bill due to its 
re lianGe on oil, coal 

With a career-long commit-
ment to education that far outrivals 
her opponents, Democratic incum-
bent Susan Davis is the narural 
choice to serve as UCSDl; con-
gresswoman in the 53rd district. 

Serving on the House 
Education and Workforce, Armed 
Services, and Veterans Affairs com-
mittees, Davis is already a relative-
ly inAuential member of the House 
of Representatives in several areas 
relevant to srudems and San Diego 
residentS. During her four years in 
Congress, Davis has introduced or 
sponsored legislation that allows 
college students to consolidate 
their student loans, gives mi nority 
and low-income studentS equal 
opportunities to receive higher 
education and offers incentives for 
highly qualified teachers to teach. 

Her main opponent, 
Republican Darin Hunzeker, calls 
for reducing the cost of education 

Susan Davis Blrblfl Boxer and nuclea r power, which would bring 
even bigger probl ems for 
California's supply of drinkable 
water. 

by pushing 
through tax cuts 
and setting up 
educational sav-
ings accounts. 
While tax cuts 
in theory might 
reduce the COSt 
of providing 
education, the SuYn Davis 
last four years 
have shown that the price of educa-
tion is being driven by increased 
demand rather than higher costs; as 
more and more srudents want to 
attend college, colleges can contin-
ue increasing tuition, while Bush's 
tax cutS of the last four years have 
done nothing to stem rising student 
fees. In addition, educational sav-
ings accounts, in which families can 
invest money for education tax-
free, merely shift risk from the gov-
ernment to individual families. 
What families really need more of 

are federal Pell grants and subsi-
dized loans, which would reduce 
the cost of higher education and 
increase accessibility without 
requiring families to put their own 
money a t risk. 

Davis, who voted against the 
consti turional amendment that 
would outlaw gay marriage, is also 
more socially moderate than 
Hunzeker, who has made rhe 
curbing of illegal immigration a 
centerpiece of his campaign. 
While Davis also supports 
increased border protection, 
Hunzeker goes so far as to call for 
the denial of citizenship to U .S.-
born children of illegal immi-
grants and the implementation of 
invasive verification technologies, 
such as biometric facial scanning 
and fingerprint systems. Davis' 
more moderate views would be a 
much better fit for San Diegans. 
Vote Davis for Congress. 

In terms of the economy, an 
issue that will directly affect every 
UC graduate next year, Boxer is in 
favor of providing direct federal 
grants to California in order to 
cover the budget'S underperfor-
mance. She is a major supporter 
of providing tax relief for working 
familie s, increasing the mition tax 
credit and lowering interest on 
student loans. As a stau nch propo-
nent of improving all levels of 
education, Boxer wants to 
increase funding for Pell grants 
and Stafford loans that help stu-
dents pay for college with lower 
interest rates when repaying the 
government. Jones, the former 
California Secretary of State, 
includes his stance on every issue 
except education on his Web site. 

In the Golden State, we need a 
Senator who's willing to focus on 
the environmental problems that 
are specific to our state and the 

Boxer is also the leading advo-
ca te of after- school programs, 
having wrinen a law that provides 
such programs for 3.5 million stu-
dents . 

Finall y, although it is not a 
state-speci fie issue, Boxer has 
taken strides to improve our 
national defense without com pro-
mising her fundamental beliefs; 
she dissented against the use of 
force in Iraq in 2002, while writ-
ing legislation to prm·ide more 
security at our ports, which i an 
important issue to the residents of 
San Diego . 

A1thoughJones may have been 
successful in his previous offices, 
he does not re present 
Californians nearly as well as 
Boxer, which is why she de,erves 
the vote on Nov. 2.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, NOVEMBER 1,2004 

Local Elections 
State Senate: l)istricr ,)9 

Christine Kehoe 
As state assemblywoman, San 

Diego native Christine Kehoe has 
been involved in everything from 
the California Coastal 
Commission and the Public Safety 
and Neighborhood Services 
Committee to the legislator's offi-
cial Lesbian Gay Bisexual 
1rransgender caucus and the 
National Organization for 
Women . 

Representing the 76th District 
as the second woman ever elected 
speaker pro tempore of the 
Assembly, Kehoe now has her 
sights set on the state Senate 39th 
district seat. Having also served 
seven years as city councilmem-
ber, she's facing off against Larry 
Stirling, a retired judge who also 
served in the Assembly and on the 
San Diego City Council. 

During her stint in the state 
assembly, she's fought for local 
improvements, winning over a mil-
lion dollars each for improvements 
to Balboa Park and to improve the 

water quality of 
the San Diego 
River. 

Showing her 
relentless sup-
port for civil 
rights, educa-
tion and the 
need for 
improved safety Christine Kehoe 
and cleanliness 
in San Diego neighborhoods, 
Kehoe has held hearings on the 
city's Equal Opportunity 
Ordinance, funded and expanded 
the city's "6 to 6 Extended Day 
School Program," and been picked 
to chair the San Diego Regional 
Partnership for Home Ownership. 

Kehoe's experience as speaker 
pro tempore, who is responsible 
for managing the daily operation 
of the state Assembly, would also 
serve her well if elected to the state 
senate. 

Last spring, Kehoe made 
known her position on higher edu-

cation in the UC system - and its 
economic side effects - when she 
participated in a UCSD town hall 
meeting, contesting the governor's 
proposed budget due to the hin-
drance it would cause to the com-
mitments and promises of the 
Master Plan. With a strong 
endorsement from current State 
Senator Dede Alpert, who reiterat-
ed Kehoe's sentiments at that same 
meeting, it looks like Kehoe will 
continue to make great strides 
toward improving the quality of 
higher education at an affordable 
price. 

Although Stirling has discredit-
ed Kehoe for being on the board 
that was partially responsible for 
San Diego's credit-rating problems 
and for being listed as the 12th 
most likely to not vote in the 
Assembly (out of 80), the 
Republican's criticism can only 
carry so much weight against a 
candidate with this kind of report 
card. . 

State Asscn1bly: District 75 
Karen Heumann 

Though incumbent state 
Assemblyman George Plescia may 
be heavily favored to win the his-
torically Republican 75th 
District's vote, Democratic chal-
lenger Karen Heumann is more 
worthy of the position . 

Heumann, a self-proclaimed 
moderate and the more main-
stream candidate of the two, is 
running on a platform centered 
on increasing funding for educa-
tion , exploring possi ble trans-
portation alternatives and ensur-
ing environmental protection. 

While all of these issues are 
important to the district, her pro-
gressive stance on education in 
particular is most encouraging. 
With an "education is our future" 
mentality, Heumann fully recog-
nizes the growing trend of cutting 
funding for education to provide 

What's most remarkable about 
mayoral write-in candidate and 
current city councilwoman 
Donna Frye is not her apolitical 
charm or her surfer-chick affabil-
ity, but the simple fact that she 
actually has a shot (albeit a long 
one) at being elected. This says 
more than a little about the state 
of affairs in San Diego, but it also 
speaks volumes about Frye's qual-
ifications for the position of 
mayor. 

The only Democrat running in 
what was to be a runoff race 
between Mayor Dick Murphy and 
County Supervisor Ron Roberts, 
Frye champions government's 
chief purpose: to serve con-
stituents openly and honestly -
very much in contrast to the way 
many people now sec the city 
being run. 

Frye is undeniably the c~ndidate 
for San Diego environmentalists 
and social liberals, but also, perhaps 
surprisingly, for fiscal conserva-
tives . She was the first coun-
cilmember to publicly criticize 
pension underfunding and was 

for other pro-
grams in the 
state budget, 
and has pro-
posed numer-
ous plans to 
increase state 
reven ue so as 
to lessen the 
blow of the Karen Heumann 
budget cuts to 
university campuses across the 
state. 

With four children in the pub-
lic school system, Heumann has a 
vested interest in making sure that 
education becomes a top priority 
for the legislature. Plescia, on the 
other hand, proposed a bill that 
would have reduced the funding 
education receives from lottery 
revenues by 10 percent, a ludi-
crous proposition when the edu-

izes, responsi-
bly, that the city 
cannot afford 
major infra- Don ... Frye 
structure pro-
jects like a new downtown library 
or a stadium for the San Diego 
Chargers. 

More importantly for San 
Diego's collegiate community, 
though, Frye recognizes the need 
for more affordable housing and 
favors incentive-based programs to 
point developers in this direction. 
In March, she helped pass a 
"Tenant's Right to Know" ordi-
nance that specified the grounds 
under which longtime tenants can 
be evicted, and her ideas on transit 
- mcluding public transportation 
and traffic-signal synchronization 
- are the most well-developed and 
commuter-friendly of any of the 
candidates. 

cational system finds itself in 
increasingly difficult financial 
times. 

In addition, Heumann, a 
small-business owner, will be a 
valuable and unique voice in the 
legislature to improve California's 
small-business economy. Her 
goals of reforming business regu-
lations and establishing incentives 
for job creation are sensible and 
can only help the state. 

Heumann is endorsed by the 
Sierra Club, the California 
School Employees Association 
and the California Nurses 
Association, among others. Vote 
Karen Heumann for the 75th 
state Assembly District - up 
against an incumbent in a histori-
cally conservative district, she's 
going to need all the, help she can 
get. 

Conservation issues have been 
Frye's strongest calling in her four 
years on city council, and on this 
issue she most definitely has her 
opponents beat. Even Murphy's 
environmentally sound record, 
which earned him the Sierra Club's 
endorsement when the race was a 
two-man battle, pales in compari-
son to Frye's, which includes suc-
cessful bids for runoff monitoring, 
healthier beaches and cleaner 
warer. 

Indeed, the overall quality of 
life for San Diegans seems to fac-
tor more into Frye's candidacy 
than Roberts' and Murphys com-
bined. Throughout the race, the 
two Republicans have been trading 
petty blows over the city's financial 
quandaries and each other's leader-
ship qualifications. However, it has 
been Ftye who, in less than a 
month of candidacy, has shown the 
right combination of self-assur-
ance and idealism that qualifies a 
real leader - a welcome sign for a 
city suffering from politics-as-
usual. Write-in Donna Frye for 
Mayor.

LEnERS TO THE EDITOR 
Health and safety 

primary co-op concern 
Editor: 

As part of my re ponsibility in 
Student Affairs, 1 have been work-
ing with the co-ops and the 
Associated Students and Graduate 
Student Association to bring the 
co-op negotiations to a viable con-
clusion. It has been a continuing 
challenge, but the administration at 
UCSD wants very much to try and 
find a workable solution. 

Our primary concern is for the 
health and safety of students. There 
have been dangerous violations of 
operating codes. Although some of 
the information you have heard in 
the last few months has not con-
veyed that very well, it is a critical 
component of these issues. Much 
of the current discrepancy is as a 
result of sub-standard business 
practices that have created an 
unsafe and unhealthy environment 
within the co-op area. 

The health and safety violations 
include unauthorized modifications 
to indoor and outdoor spaces by an 
unlicensed electrician and unautho-
rized major kitchen remodeling by 
an unlicensed trade person. The 
University Centers staff corrected 
these alterations because they pre-
sented hazardous conditions that 
may have resulted in electric shock 
or fire. 

Additionally, in the garden area 
within the park, unauthorized tap-
ping into the university'S irrigation 
system and continuous watering 
resulted in tho loss of thousands of 
gallons of water. Most significantly, 
waste has been disposed of danger-
ously, at one point causing injury to 
a student. 

It is time to find some common 
ground, correct these problem 
areas, and develop a contract that is 

acceptable to the co-ops, the stu-
dents and the university. I would 
like to encourage all those students 
that are interested in the co-op sit-
uation and a safe retail and social 
environment to talk with their 
Associated Students and Graduate 
Student Association representatives 
about what needs to be done to 
bring this to an acceptable resolu-
tion. 

We want to support an entre-
preneurial university environment 
that values and fosters creative 

. learning experiences, including the 
management of student run busi-
nesses, such as the co-ops. But 
unless we all agree that certain 
business practices will be adhered 
to, we will continue to be at an 
impasse. The university does not 
want to be on hold. We want to find 
a solution, but we cannot legally or 
knowingly condone sub-par busi-
ness practices. 

I hope YOIl all will do what you 
can to work with us toward a solu-
tion that supports a well-run co-op 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

system that provides the same 
goods and services that are appreci-
ated within the community while

Statewide cuts force 
tough decisions 

Editor: 
As UCSD deals with statewide 

and University of California-wide 
budget challenges, we are pleased 
to announce that we have reached a 
workable solution on the very 
important issue of outreach fund-
ing, although we did have to face 
some tough decisions. 

Over the past two years, out-
reach programs in the University of 
California have experienced fund-
ing reductions in excess of 50 per-
cent. Fortunately, in working 
together with the Office of the 
President in an effort to respond to 
a number of priorities, we have 
developed an approach that main-
tains the integrity and effectiveness 
of the programs, in a fiscally 
responsible way, within the current 
statewide budget limitations. 

Through consideration of cam-
pus priorities, systemwide guide-
lines, and community concerns and 
recommendations, UCSD has 
developed an allocation that places 
priority on the Preuss School, 
Community College Transfer 
Center, and Early Academic 
Outreach Program. 

As a consequence of these prior-
ities and the lack of funding, major 
reductions in funding for student-
initiated outreach, graduate and 
professional school programs and

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 2004 

Letters: Funding reductions 
for outreach necessary 

continued from ,. 9 
Center for Research on 
Educational Equity, Assement and 
Teaching Excellence had to be 
made. 

By reallocation of our limited 
outreach funding, we have been 
able to increase by 65 percent the 
permanent budget of EAOP from 
its 2003-04 level. Accomplishing 
that increase, however, required a 
reduction of the permanent budget 
for the Community College 
Transfer Program. In order to 
protect this very important out-
reach program, other campus 
funds have been allocated so that 
the funding level for 2004-05 can 
be maintained at last year's level. 
In addition, CREATE will have 
funding reinstated for outreach 
evaluation. 

The outreach reductions have 
created a very serious funding 
shortfall for Preuss School. The 
state outreach allocation that has 
funded the three components that 
constitute the core of the Preuss 
"experiment" -longer school day, 
longer school year, and smaller 
classes - as well as the transporta-
tion costs for the students to be 
able to come to Preuss, has been 
reduced in half. Consequently, we 
are pleased that the Office of the 
President has indicated a willing-
ness to increase the UCSD P-16 
Partnership allocation for Preuss 
School. 

This has been a very complex 
process. We appreciate everyone's 
effort and commitment in bringing 
this difficult funding situation to a 
workable conclusion. It is not a 
perfect solution, and we wish that 
we had additional funding to ade-
quately support all of the outreach 
programs. 

In summary, the reductions in 
excess of 50 percent in state sup-
port for outreach programs have 
required a careful evaluation of our 
priorities as we strive to continue 
UCSD's longstanding commit-
ment to outreach and service to our 

community.

Prop. 71 endorsed by 
all-star group 

Editor: 
Proposi tion 71 has recently 

picked up the endorsements of 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and 
former President Jimmy Carter 
just last week. 

They join a diverse and large 
coalition of supporters that include 
the deans of all the UC medical 
schools (excepting UC Davis' new 
dean who remains to be confirmed 
by the UC Regents). Stanford 
Dean of Medicine Phil Pizzo, USC 
Dean of Medicine Brian 
Henderson, California Institute of 
Technology President David 
Baltimore, and UC San Francisco 
Chancellor J. Michael Bishop back 
this humane measure. 

Proposition 71 guarantees $3 
billion over the next 14 years to 
fund stem cell research that has the 
potential to treat or cure over 70 
degenerative diseases. To protect 
our state economy, the proposition 
defers repayment of interest and 
bond principal for five years. This 
proposition not only has huge scien-
tific implications but, for students in 
particular, restrictive federal policy 
challenges our intellectual freedom. 

This measure has been endorsed 
by more than 20 Nobel laureates in 
the life sciences; by scientific and 
medical associations and California 
budget analysts; by Alzheimer's, 
Parlcinson's, juvenile diabetes, 
spinal cord injury, and manyaddi-
tional patient advocacy organiza-
tions; by the American Nurses 
Association of California, the 
California chapter of the National 
Organization for Women, and

campus EAOP staff level dropped 
from 26 members to four this 
year. With the possibility of more 
money to work with now, the pro-
gram will look into increasing its 
staff and services, Hernandez 
said. 

Under the new plan, Preuss 
School funding will be cut from 
$530,000 to $500,000, and stu-
dent-initiated outreach funding 
will decrease from $60,000 to 
$20,000. Community college out-
reach will also be cut almost 50 
percent, with additional revenue 
to come from temporary campus 
funding. Money for test prepara-
tion and dual admissions pro-
grams was removed completely 
from the budget. 

"This is a complicated process, 
and we negotiated and had discus-
sions with the Office of the 
President about priorities and 
needs," Watson said. "As a result, 
we were able to work out an 
arrangement, which I think meets 
all of the needs and priorities of the 
campus, as well as those of the 

Office of the President." 
A. S. President'Jenn Pae said 

that, while there were dispropor-
tionate cuts across the programs 
under the new budget proposal, 
the new allocation for EAOP is 
better than the one previously sub-
mined. 

"I'm glad to see that EAOP has 
been allotted more money than 
before, because UCSD EAOP has 
consistently exceeded expecta-
tions," Pae said. "Our commitment 
to the Preuss School is important, 
but we should look into additional 
sources of revenue for Our charter 
school rather than tapping into our 
outreach funds." 

Hernandez also commended 
the administration for including all 
campus outreach entities in the 
budget proposal. 

"It seems to me that we're all 
still running short, but given the 
fact that no one was eliminated ." 
its a positive sign," Hernandez 
said. 

The submitted budget is still 
pending final approval from 
UCOP.

Heritage: Student concert 
raises $8,171 to .keep classes 

conlinued from page t 
they have responded to demand 
for the program, as Dean of 
Social Sciences Paul Drake grant-
ed a special allocation of $48,000 
to the Heritage Language pro-
gram last summer. 

"We thought it w~s a very inno-
vative, creative and exciting pro-
gram," Drake said. "It could be a 
great service to the San Diego 
community." 

Kluender is drafting a grant 
request to the U.S. Department of 
Education for funds for South 
Asian studies, which would benefit 
Heritage Language Programs such 
as Vietnamese and Tagalog. 

While he is grateful for the 
administration 5 aid, Kluender said 
more money is needed to keep the 
young Heritage Language 
Program afloat. 

Various UCSD student organi-
zations have responded to the 
cause. For example, the 
Vietnamese Students Associations 
at UCSD and San Diego State 
and VAYA held a "Saving 
Language, Saving Diversity" con-
cert at a San Diego high school on 
Oct. 16. 

The concert raised approxi-
mately $8,171, according to 
Nguyen, far short of the 547,000 
needed to fund the Vietnamese 
Heritage Languase Program this 
year. 

The concert featured tradi-
tional Viemamese performances 
u well u modern native 
Vietnamese singers. 

·PeopIe were reaIJy supportive,· 
udd CO~ attendee and 
ThUIJOOCI Marshall CoHege fresh-
man JICIene Le. "It was a really 
Jood effort and there were a lot of 

sponsors." 
The groups banded together for 

the event in order to provide addi-
tional funds to the program, 
according to a letter sent to possi-
ble sponsors. 

.. As part of the effort to save the 
Heritage Language Program at 
UCSD, we are organiz.ing a 
Heritage Concert to raise funds for 
this excellent program," VAYA stat-
ed in the letter. "Due to our limit-
ed budget, we have to look for 
sponsorships from individuals, 
businesses and organizations ... 
who, in return, may benefit from 
sponsoring this project." 

The Viemamese sections of the 
program are the most popular 
among students, with three class 
sections of approximately 30 stu-
dents each during the current 
quarter, according to Kluender. 

The UCSD Pilipino Students . 
Saving Tagalog group has also 
been involved in aiding the lan-
guage program, hosting charity 
banquets the past two years for the 
Tagalog Heritage Language 
Program, in conjunction with 
UCSD Kaibigang Pilipino. The 
groups plan to sponsor another 
similar banquet during winter 
quarter, according to KP 
Academic Director and PSST core 
member Jimiliz Valiente. 

Kluender said that he had 
reached out to student organiza-
tions for aid. 

"Everyone seems very motivat-
ed," he said. "We need the student 
OI'pnizations to reach out to the 
community fOl' support of the pro-
gram."

According to Santiago, he had 
taken down all logos from his mast-
head a week before, after receiving 
similar requests from other organi-
zations included on the page -
such as the San Ysidro Health 
Clinic - and does not plan to dis-
play any more UCSD emblems. 

The San Ysidro Health Center 
and the UCSD Center for 
Community Health Division of 
Pediatrics are currently collaborat-
ing on the Southern California 
Border HIV/AIDS Project, a pro-
gram federally funded by the Health 
Resource Services Administration. 

Santiago's Web site c.laims that 
the project'S health workers have 
contact with sexually abused ado-
lescent girls and do not report the 
crimes. 

The Federal Child Abuse 
Prevention and Treatment Act 
mandates that citizens report the 
serual abuse of minors.

"It's a grave moral error on their 
[health workers'] part," Santiago 
said. "What we want to see is that 

. the people responsible be held 
responsible. " 

UCSD Medical Center denies 
Santiago's charges, and claims that 
its pan in the program is complete-
ly legitimate, according to Health 
Sciences Communications director 
Leslie Franz. 

"UCSD manages one component 
of the project," she said "We work in 
coUaboration with community clinics 
in collecting and evaluating data of 
patients, and also evaluate popuIa-

" EverytlUng on the Web 
site is completely false, 
completely unfounded 

and very inflammatory."

SdencIs Communkations 

tions at risk, so we have minimal if no 
contact with them directly," 

However, Santiago said he Was 
skeptical about the university's lack 
of involvement. 

"They claim to be evaluating," 
he said. "But, however they do that, 
they have to interact with the clin-
ics that have these workers, who 
turn their heads to these sexua1ly 
abused preteen girls. UCSD claims 
to be one of the leaders of this pro-
ject, so they must know something, 
at least about the clinics." 

On the Web site, Santiago 
claims that the clinics provide free 
condoms to men that are used in 
the sexual abuse of Mexican girls. 
He further states that when an 

anonymous doctor tried to report 
the abuses, she was rebuffed by 
program officials. 

"The people in charge of this 
program are thinking that they can 
just ignore these girls' rights," 
Santiago said. "But just because 
they are from Mexico doesn't mean 
that they can be ignored." 

Franz denied all accusations 
against UCSD, and said that the 
Web site's allegations are unsup-
ported. 

"Everything on the Web site is 
completely false, completely 
unfounded and very infianunalOry," 
she said. "Our program is a federal-
ly funded project, and we abide by 
all appropriate rules and regula-
tions. I don't know where [Santiago) 
would get such accusations." 

The site cites articles from 
Hispanic publications such as EJ 
Univtrrial and uses mostly anony-
mous sources, according to 
Santiago. While Los Cristeros 
does not currently have any official 
members, Santiago says that any-
where from 50-100 people have 
contributed to its findings. 

"Initially, I was very interested in 
the fact that this project was aiming 
toward this specific group [sexua1ly 
abused Mexican girls} for mY and 
AIDS prevention," he said. 

On its Web site, The UCSD 
Center for Community Health's 
project overview states that one of 
the "underserved sub-populations 
that will be targeted in [the 
Southern California Border 
HIV/AlDS Project} are youth sex 
workers." The university does not 
plan to seek any further legal action 
against Santiago or the Los 
Cristeros Web site, according to 
Parode and Franz.

MONDAY, NOV!MBEil I, 2004 THE UCSD OUARDIAN SI'ORTS 15 

Soccer: Lai, Sepulveda each"; 
score twice with an assist 

Men~s soccer: UCSD is ready for .postseason 
continued from fXJIe 16 

board when Cochran sent a feed to 
Lai who blasted the ball into the 
right comer from 12 yards out for 
a quick 1-0 lead in the second 
minute. Five minutes later, fresh-
man defender Stacy Johnson 
joined the offensive rush and sent 
a pus across to Lai, who was 
parked sill yards out from the right 
side of the net. Lai put the ball 
into the net for her second goal of 
the game. 

But in the 35th minute, Cal State 
Baken6eld was awarded a penalty 
kick, which sophomore forward 
Taylar Sklar kicked into ~ upper--
right comer to put the Roadrunners 
back in the pme at 2-1. 

defense in front of Lautenschleger, 
with junior defender Heather 
Szafraniec directing traffic in the 
Tritons' backfield to prevent the 
RoadrUMen from creating any 
scoring opportunities. 

Because the Tritons ,ot off to a 
huge lead early in the second half, 
it allowed McManus to rat his 
starters and give his other playen a 
chance to play. Junior midfielder 
Meira Dinsmore clme off the 
bench to tally ber 6nt «oaI of the 
season late in the half to give 
UCSD a 6-1 lead that secured the 
victory, 

continued from page 16 
and each defense silenced the 
opposition. The Tritons, however, 
undentood the importance of this 
game and stole it away from the 
RoadruMen in the second over-
time period. 

With less than two minutes left 
and a looming tie that would keep 
the Tritons in jeopardy of missing 
the playoffs, a Roadrunner 
defenseman tackled senior for-
ward nago Venturi inside the 
penalty area after Venturi received 
a pass from junior forward Jon 
Krupansky. Davey, who is the 
Tritons' point leader with six goals 
and four assists in 15 games, was 
In obvious choice to take the 
penalty kick. 

With the win, the Tritons up 

their record to 8-4-3 overall and 
7 -4-2 in league play. The 
Roadrunners fall to 14-4-2 overall 
and 10-2-2 in the CCAA. With 
their respective records, both 
teams will make the CCAA cham-
pionships. The Tritons broke 
their two-game losing streak and 
have improved their record at 
home to 5-1-3. 

UCSD will play its final game 
at RIMAC Field on Nov. 1 as a 
makeup of the Oct. 27 game 
against Cal State San Bernardino 
that was postponed due to weath-
er conditions. 

The game will serve as a con-
fidence- and momentum-booster 
for the Tritons going into the 
playoffs, should they win. The 
Coyotes have no chance of mak-

ing the playoffs, even though 
they beat the Tritons earlier in 
tho! season at Cal State San 
Bernardino on Oct. 6. 

"We.'re in the playoffs now, so 
the next game is just 10 get our 
focus and prepare for our game 
next week, ~ Russell said. 

The Tritons will be sharing the 
CCM spotlight in Carson with 
Cal State Dominguez Hills, Cal 
Poly Pomona and Cal State 
Bakenfield. The Tritons are 0-1-1 
against Cal State Dominguez 
Hills, 1-1-0 in games against Cal 
Poly Pomona and 2-0-0 against 
Cal State Bakersfield. 

"Once we find out who we're 
playing we'll make a game plan, 
and then take it one game at a 
time, ~ Russell said. 

The penalty kick proved to be 
the only time the Roadrunners 
would score, as UCSD ezploded 
with five \llWlSWered goals in the 
second half. 

This triumph was especially 
sweet for Shaffer and 
Lautenschleger, who were honored 
on Senior Day. Both have enjoyed 
the time that they have spent play-
ing for UCSD. 

"This has been awesome, ~ 
Lautr:nschIep said -I didn't play 
terribly much durinr the last three 
yan - and it WIll liard - but the 
rewards came, and 1 laYe the game. 
[This season) has been very fortunate, 
1 have an awesome defense, so the 
year has definitely been a blessing. ~ 

Points: Kobe displays optimism for 2005 Lakers 
In the 49th minute, Lai dribbled 

toward the net and passed it to an 
onrushing Sepulveda on her right. 
From 10 yards out, Sepulveda's shot 
went over Cal State Bakersfield 
goalie Sara Purdy\ head. 

1bree minutes later, Cochran 
scored her siIth goal of the season 
to put the Tritons up even higher, 
4-1. Senior mid fielder )adyn 
Shaffer and Sepulveda were rush-
ing into the RoadruMen' zone on 
the left side. Sepulveda fed the baU 
to Shaffer, who spotted Cochran 
running up to the right post. 
Shaffer sent the ball over to 
Cochran, who headed it to the back 
of the net froJD four yards out. 

In the 56th minute, Sepulveda 
and Cochran attacked again. This . 
time, Cochran sent the ball to 
Sepulveda, who headed it in for her 
second goal of the season. 

Meanwhile, UCSD played solid 

Lautenschleger has a goals-
against average of 0.67 to lead all 
goalies in the CCM plus 52 saves, 
including eight shutouts in the sea-
son. Shaffer has three goals and an , 

. assist so far in her last year of pi ay. 
The Tritons have one game left 

in the season against Cal State San 
Bernardino on Nov. l. UCSD will 
play at RlMAC Field at 7 p.m. 

Shaffer knows UCSD is capable 
of closing out its season with a win. 

"I think we have to keep doing 
what we've been doing and just 
play with a lot of hean," Shaffer 
said. "I think sometimes we're 
missing that. We have all the talent 
that we need." 

continued from page 16 
As the Laker guard left the 

gym, he was swanned by fans and 
autograph-seeken on his way to 
the team bus. 1 followed him until 
he eventually noticed me on his 
heels. 

"What's up man?" Bryant said 
tome. 

Sa 1 got a chance to utilize the 
wonderful privileges that being a 
writer for the GUlmJilln gives me 
and was able to have a shorr con-
versation with the future hall-of-
famer, trying hard to keep up with 
him (his strides were twice as long 
as mine). 

For eight yean, I've noticed 
Kobe on the courr, walking with a 
certain swagger that suggested a 
slight bit of arrogance and cocki-
ness (although this sense of arro-
gance and cockiness screams from 
most of the overpaid NBA com-

munity). On this day outside of 
RIMAC, I noticed that Kobe had 
a different swagger - one that 
hinted at humility. 

We all know that 26-year-old 
Bryant has been presented with 
challenges in the past; this 
upcoming NBA season he is fac-
ing a new one. Kobe, who went 
whining to his boss and got his 
way, yet again is going to be play-
ing one-an-five basketball 
(which one could argue he's done 
before) as he is surrounded by 
teammates that belong on a )V 
team. 

"I'm excited, ~ Bryant said 
when I asked him about the long 
journey that starts at Los Angeles' 
Staples Center against the Denver 
Nuggets on Nov. 2. "We got a 
young team, and it's gonna be 
fresh." 

Everything that has been made 

public during the past year about 
Bryant raced through my mind as 
1 stood next to him; I realized that 
I'm not talking to one of the 
brightest stars that the basketball 
world has seen, but I'm talking to 
a man who has cheated on his 
wife, backstabbed a teammate and 
been accused of rape. 

It used to be a privi I ege to 
watch Bryant blow by a defender 
on his way to the hoop from the 
nosebleed seats. Now, I'm still 
amazed to be standing next to 
him, but not because of his tal -
ent, but instead because of how 
he managed to lose his heroic 
image. 

When we reached his bus, we 
shook hands and 1 wished him 
good luck. Good luck on reach-
ing the playoffs this season, and 
good luck on building a new rep-
utation.

The No. 7 Cal State San 
Bernardino women's volleyball 
team knew No.2 UCSD's starters 
would show up ready to play. 
What it didn't count on was the 
clutch play of the Triton bench 
that ignited UCSD to step up and 
secure the 3 -1 win over the 
Coyotes (30-19, 30-26, 23-30, 30-
23) in a crucial late-season match 
on Oct. 27 at RlMAC Arena. 

"The turning point of the 
match was having our bench come 
in and make things happen when 
we were struggling," UCSD head 
coach Duncan McFarland said. 
"We've always talked about the 
fact that there's a lot of different 
roles on our team; some people 
have big roles and [some have] 
smaller roles, but they're all 
important to our team." 

Entc:ring the match, Cal State 
San Bernardino was second 
behind UCSD in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association. 

"1 thought we were really well 
prepared going into the match," 
McFarland aid. "It was just a 
hard-fought match all-in-all, and 
it always is between us two teams; 
there's a lot of hi tory, a lot of bad 
blood between us." 

Triton senior outside hitter 
Bonnie Wilson led with 17 kills 
and 14 digs, foUowed by senior 
middle blocker Katie Hogan, who 
posted 14 kills, hitting for .520. 
Senior outside hitter Stacy 
Dunsmore contributed nine kills 
and seven digs. Senior setter 
Teresa Ohta guided the Triton 
offense with 46 assists while 
adding four kills of her own. 

Defensively, freshman libero 
Natalie Facchini notched a match-
high 16 digs. Although UCSD 
expected a tough match, the team 

never doubted its ability to come 
away with the win. 

"I came in with the mindset 
that we just have to relax and play 
our game," Facchini said. "I wasn't 
worried at all because we were 
playing at our home gym, and I 
pretty much had confidence in our 
team the whole game ... .I went in 
knowing we were going to pull it 
out." 

Although the Coyotes had 
three players record double-digits 
in kills, including a match-high 23 
kills by senior outside hitter 
Brianna Harris, the Tritons' all-
around play proved to be too 
much for their CCM rivals. 

UCSD took an early lead in 
game one, eventufllly running 
away with a 30-19 victory. 

In game two, the Tritons 
stayed ahead, gaining a 23-14 lead 
at one occasion. Cal State San 
Bernardino adjusted and saved 
five-straight set points to keep it at 
29-26. Finally, it was the Coyotes' 
own error that gave UCSD the 
game-winning point. 

Fresh from its near-comeback, 
Cal State San Bernardino turned up 
the pressure and took a 20-10 lead 
in game three. UCSD answered 
back, getting help from its bench. 
Freshman outside hitter Amber 
Ries came in to replace junior out-
side hittt:r Lindsay Crandell. 
Sophomore middle blocker 
Brianna Koche and sophomore 
outside hitter Francesca Centofanti 
also took the court in game three, 
helping the Tritons narrow the 
Coyotes' lead. With Hogan serv-
ing, UCSD scored four straight 
points to inch closer at 24-20. 
However, Cal State San Bernardino 
pulled away with a 30-23 win to 
force game four. Unfazed, the 
Tritons made the adjustments nec-
essary to win game four.

UCSD clinches CCAA playoff berth 
Double-OT penalty kick lifts Tritons over Bakersfield

Staff Writer 

Junior All-American Matthew 
Davey's overtime score on a 
penalty-shot follow-up gave 
UCSD the necessary 1-0 lead to 
beat Ca l State Bakersfield on 
Oct. 30. With the win, the 
UCSD men's soccer team 
extends its season by an extra 
weekend for the 2004 California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Championships, from Nov. 5 
through Nov. 7 in Carson, Calif. 

On paper, the Roadrunners 
looked superior to the Tritons: 
Cal State Bakersfield had a 
seven-game winning streak, 
while the Tritons had lost two in 
a row coming into the critical 
game. Ilowever, the Tritons had 
beat the Roadrunners, 1-0, in 
Bakersfield back in September, 
and they knew that they could 
beat them again. UCSD came 
into the game needing a win to 
make the CCAA playoffs, and got 
it with less than two minute left 
in the second overtime period. 

Davey was awarded a penalty 
kick with the difference between 
a tie and a win on his shoulders. 
Davey, who has stepped up all 
year for the Tritons, had the 
penalty kick blocked by 
Roadrunncr goa lkeeper Josh 
Wicks, but the rebound bounced 
right back to Davey, who con-
verted on his second-chance

UCSD goalkeeper Edward

second shutout of the season . 
Ruhland kept the game in reach 
while the Triton offense contin-
ued pounding the ball into 
Roadrunner territory throughout 
the game. 

The Tritons had a 5-1 shot 
advantage over Cal State 
Bakersfield in overtime and they 
outshot the Roadrunners, 20-13, 
throughout the whole match. The 
game was very physical, with 35 
penalties and six yellow cards 

between the two teams. The final 
penalty proved to be a game-
decider. According to senior 
defenseman Luke Russell, howev-
er, the penalty was a bit controver-
sial. 

"It feels good to finally catch a 
break," Russell said. He also said 
that the call was similar to one 
made earlier in the year against 
the Tritons that cost them a 
game. 

The Tritons and Roadrunners 
were very evenly matched through 
regulation and the first overtime 
period. Each goalie played solidly

The Oct. 30 game against Cal ' 
State Bakersfield was a must-win 
for the UCSD women's soccer 
team if it wanted to play past the 
regular season. The Tritons 
answered the call and clinched a 
playoff berth by demolishing Cal 
State Bakersfield, 6-1, at RlMAC 
Field. 

"It was a huge win coming off 
two losses," senior goalie Jamie 
Lautenschleger said. "We have the 
confidence, we're a great team, 
we've really got amazing skill and 
we can breathe easier knowing that 
we can get the job done when we 
show up to play." 

The California Collegiate 
Athlctic Association Champion-
ships will be held from Nov. 5 
through Nov. 7 and hosted by Cal 
State Dominguez Hills in Carson, 
Calif. 

Leading the way for UCSD 
were freshman mid fielder Ali Lai 
and sophomore forward Kathy 
Sepulveda, who each posted two 
goals and one assist. Sophomore 
forward Kelly Cochran and junior 
mid fielder Meira Dinsmore added 
a goal apiece. Cochran also picked 
up two assists in the game. 

"We needed to win today and 
we need to win again [on Nov. I]; 
it's as simple as that," UCSD head 
coach Brian McManus said. "We 
came out, we struggled a little bit

after going 2 -I ... but once the sec-
ond half started, 10, 15 minutes in, 
it was like we stepped up. We knew 
we screwed up and came out in the 
second half even more focused, 
which was great. And [Cal State 
Bakersfield] never reaIJy threat-
ened, so it was good, a good win, a 
big win." 

The win improves UCSD to 13-
3-1 overalJ and 9-3-1 in the CCAA, 
while Cal State Bakersfield drops to 
2-13-5 and 1-9-4 in the CCM.
