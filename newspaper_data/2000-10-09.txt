FallFest Defies Rain 
1,900 Students went to the concert despite a 
location change' and inclimate weather 
Associate News Editor 

The prospect of rain did not stop nearlY 
1,900 students from gathering to hear Dial-7, 
Mix Master Mike and the Long Beach Dub 
A1lstars at Fallfest 2000 in the Price Center 
Ballroom last Friday. 

"I think the show went wonderfully," said 
A.S. Festivals committee member Tarun Bajaj. 
"It was quite the mix of bands. We had hip-hop 
going; we had alternative, rap and some hard 
rock in there too." 

FallFest 2000 started at 8:30 p.m. and lasted 
three hours, with each band performing a 30-
to 60-minute set. 

The enjoyment of the three acts redeemed 
the interest of many students who were still 
angered by last year's Sun God festival. 

"' had a really good time seeing all the bands 
perform: Muir sophomore Adam Roston said. 
"Though , had my doubts after Sun God last 
year, the A.S. restored my faith in them as they 
came through with a really good show.· 

The headliner, the Long Beach Dub A1lstars. 
performed to a full ballroom at 11 :20 p.m., 
playing two unreleased songs. 

The band and crowd alike enjoyed this 
aspect of the show. "' was really stoked to play 
some of our new stuff; said drummer Bud 
Gaugh. "(The crowd) seemed like [it) really 
enjoyed some of the songs too.· 

Despite his satisfaction with the show itself, 
Gaugh said that he does not enjoy performing 

, 

at college campuses because of the restrictio.hS 
and rules inflicted upon the bands. 

"[t sucks because you can't smoke, can't 
drink. You can't do anything: he said. 

Before the group's performance on stage, 
lead singer Opie Ortiz was warned by the police 
due to a minor argument with securIty that 
occun:ed backstage. The show continued as 
planned. 

Before the beginning of the first song, Ortiz 
thanked the police for not punishing him fur-
ther. 

Many' students loved seeing the band play 
on campus. 

"[t was easy to feed off the energy of the 
crowd and the band members; said Muir 
sophomore Jesse Brand. "This ener~ made the 
whole night fun and apparently a big success.· 

Mix Master Mike. from the Beastie Boys, 
performed second on stage as he scratched and 
mixed his own records. Some of the Beastie 
Boys' better-known songs, such as 
"[ntergalactic.· were scratched and performed 
before the audience. 

"It is pretty impressive to see someone pro-
duce the kind of sounds he was making just 
with his two hands and a record player; said 
Marshall sophomore Eric Robin. "For me, his 
performance just topped off a great show by the 
Long Beach Dub A1lstars and Dial-7." 

Despite the appreciation of the audience, 
members of the opening band Dial-7 did not

Study Finds 
UCCrime 
Reports False 
Some sexual assaults at 
UCSD are generalized as 
'physical abuse' 
By JEFFREY M. BARKER 
Senior Staff Writer 

There were far more than the published 
11 sex crimes reported by campus police at 
UCSD last year. 

"I don't think the numbers we report are 
an accurate picture of the situation on cam-
pus," said Sergeant Robert Jones. He called 
the number 11 "absurd." 

Jones is head of UCSD's police depart-
ment and is responsible for upholding the 
Federal Studen t Right-to-Know, Crime 
Awareness and Campus Security Act. 

That act, also known as the Clery Act. 
came under the gun of the Sacramento Bee, 
whose five-monch-Iong investigation of sex 
crimes on University of California campuses 
concluded that crime statistics paint a mis-
leading portrayal of safety at California 's 
flagship universities. 

The statistics were published because the 
Clery Act serves to give prospective students 
a better picture of the un iversities they look 
to attend. 

"There is a false sense of security in 
going off to college," jones said., 

The Bee's assessment concentrated on 
Bay area schools, reporting that UC Davis 
largely underrep~rted its sex-related crimes 
and failed, until last month, to publish infor-
mation required by federal law under the 
Clery Act. :. 

The Sacramento Bee quoted an anony-
mous UC official who said that campuses 
deliberately under-report sex crimes in order 
to maintain an untarnished image. 

"No one wants to be the Compton of the 
UC system." the paper quotes. 

UCSD campus officials were criticized, 
along with two-thirds of the UC schools, for 
omitting sexual assaults other than those 
reported to the police department itself. 

In UC.SD's case, those crimes end up cat-
egorized as ·physical abuse." 

"We do make a distinction between those 
crimes," jones said. referring to the police 
department 's practice of separating sex 
crimes from other violent offenses. 

However, the campus security authori -
ties, from whom jones gets many of his 
numbers, do not make such a distinction . 

The authorities, consisting of college 
deans, resident deans and the Office of 
Student judicial Affairs, report crimes to the 
police department for publication of the 
required Clery Act statistics. 

Jones said, however, that from this point 
on, those groups will make a distinction so 
that the campus can better report its sex 
crimes. 

"This is the last time you'll see that [sex 
crimes reported as abuse)," Jones said. "I 've 

. been assured of that. · 
Director of Student Affairs Nick Aguilar 

was not available t9 confirm that assurance. 
However, com!;ine the 33 physical abuse 

cases reported by the campus security 
authorities last year with the 11 reported by 
the police department, and students are still

like how they performed, feeling rusty 
from a lack of playing. The band had 
not performed together for three 
weeks because they are in the process 
of releasing their first CD in Japan. 

"To tell you the truth, it was a little 
bit rough because we haven 't been 
rehearsing too much: said drummer 
Mikey Clams. "We have been trying to 
do all this business with our Japan 
thing, but it seemed like the crowd 
had a good time so it was cool." 

According to Scott Mantell, A.S. 
festivals coordinator, approximately 
1,000 people arrived early enough to 
see Dial-7 perform the opening set, 
while another 900 entered between 
the next two sets. . 

Priya Mohan, of the A.S. Festivals 
Committee, said that those who 
arrived in time to see the band wit-
nessed a solid opening act. 

"They put on a wonderful high-
energy show, I think, n she said. "I 
think they did an excellent job out 
there. They got the crowd going at the 
very beginning: 

The concert, initially planned to 
take place in the Price Center Plaza, 
was moved to the ballrooms once it 
began to rain in the afternoon. As a 
result, the number of students allowed 
in at one time was cut to 1,500, due to 
the maximum capacity of the room. By 
the conclusion of the evening, 1,900 
students had been allowed in.

left with an inaccurate portrayal of the 
crime on campus. 

"From 27 years on law enforce-
ment, I know that 44 is not accurate: 
Jones said. 

Beyond fixing problems with 
paperwork - correctly categorizing 
and reporting known statistics -
there is another, larger problem 
impeding an accurate picture of sex 
crimes at UCSD. 

"Sexual assault is one of the most 
under-reported crimes: said Nancy 
Wahlig, director of the Student Safety 
Awareness Program. "It's not uncom-
mon that the victim will say 'I'll just 
keep it to myself' or 'I don't wan' to 
get anybody in trouble' or 'What will a 
police report be like?'" 

Wahlig's program is the primary 
resource on campus for rape preven-
tion, date violence and self-defense. 

She cites reports claiming that one 
in four or one in six women will be a 
victim of sexual assault or attempted 
sexual assault before she graduates 
from college. 

The number of women who will be 
sexually assaulted at UCSD, according 
to this statistic, comes out to 2,500. 
While the crime statistics published by 
the police department alongside the 
quarterly schedule of classes do not 
match up, the bigger problem is that 
crimes are not being reported at all. 
. "I think the intent of the Clery Act 
IS that colleges are not just giving 
numbers but that they produce a com-
prehensive program to create aware-
ness: Wahlig said. 

Her program holds workshops and 
spreads information about sexual 
assault. A theatre performance for 
incoming freshmen, called 
"Unspeakable Acts; is in its second 
year. Wahlig hopes that after a few 
years of performances, everybody on 
campus will know that her office is a 
resource and place to go to if one bas 
been sexually assaulted. 

Wahlig's office may be better pre-
pared to give an accurate picture of sex-
ual assault on campus. However, many 
of the people who seek out the Student 
Safety Awareness office for information

BRIEFLY 

UC Reports on Apparel Manufacturing 
The University of Cellfornia, Harvard 

University, the University of Notre Dame and the 
University of Michigan released a report com-
piled by a team of independent consultants on 
Oct. 6. 

The universities commissioned the consul· 
tants to gathe~ and analyze information on 
apparel manufacturing. 

The report is the result of a year·long effort 
that included the compilation and analysis of 
information about working conditions In the 
apparel industry in several countries. In addition, 
the report included an observation of working 
conditions in a sampling of factories in countries 
that represent a substantial portion of the uni· 
versitY'licensed apparel business; and a survey 
of efforts being undertaken by the government, 
business, labor and independent organizations 
involved in efforts to improve working condi· 
tions. 

The findings included the existence of sub-par 
working conditions in all of the countries visited. 
The diffuse nature of apparel production hinders 
enforcement of labor conditions. Awareness of 
codes ()f conduct and monitoring efforts Is cur· 
rently not sufficient to promote effective com-
pliance. 

Many' trade unions and some nongovernmen-
tal organizations are skeptical about the effi-
ciency of monitoring. The proliferation of codes 
of conduct and the resulting duplication of m0n-
itoring efforts does not support greater compli· 
ance.

ft6II: A student plays a didgeridD. an Australian tribal instrument, at Fall Festival on the Green. 

Concert: 
Non UCSD students had to be 
turned away from the concert 
ContInued from ..... 2 

Individuals outside were admitted once oth-
ers left the concert. 

Mantell said that approximately 700 to 
1,000 people were not admitted into the per-
formances due to the capacity restriction. In 
addition, over 300 students without UCSD 
ID cards were not allowed into Friday's per-
formance. . 

"We would have had a lot more people if 
we had let (non-UCSD students in), but our 
priority was to let [UCSD) students in: 
Mantell said. "We didn't want to tum them 
away, but we had no choice." 

He added that crowd capacity would have 
been limitless without the rain. However, :he 
students were not the only ones heavily 

affected by the rain and the change in concert 
setting. Stage manager Vicki Bender attribut-
es the successful shift from outside to inside 
to the stage crews. 

"I think the crew did an awesome job, n she 
said. "I would-have liked to have had more 
people, but the show had a really good vibe to 
it: 

FallFest 2000 represents the first of three 
large festivals put on by the Associated 
Students this year. Winterfest is scheduled for 
February, and Sun God Festival will take place 
late during spring quarter. 

"This is the third year of FallFest, and we 
wanted to kick off the school year well: 
Bender said. "Obviously Sun God has already 
been established, but it's nice to have some-
'thing at the beginning of the year as well." 

The Festivals Committee meets every 
Friday at 11 a.m. on the third floor of the 
Price Center. Mantell encourages all those 
interested to attend. 

"The more people the better: Mantell 
said. "We want to know who peop~e want."

TURNING 
Voting for Ralph Nader as the next president is not a 
castaway vote but, rather, a vote for the sodal and 
polical future of America. 
By AllAN IADJA 
Staff Writer 

Here in the United States we con-
sider ourselves privileged to live in a· 
democratic society where we have a 
choice between two politically differ-
ent candidates. This year is no differ-
ent; there are two main candidates, 
and as usual, several 
third-party candi-
dates. Chief among 
th em is Ralph 
Nader. However, 
many say that voting 
for Nader would be 
like throwing a vote 
away. 

In recent years it 
seems that choosing 
between the two major presidential 
candidates has been akin to. choosing 
between the lesser of two evils. 
Honestly, who has never sa id that 
about the candidates before? 
Unfortunately it is true to some 
extent. 

What is even worse is the lack of 
difference between the two major can-
didates. If you watched the first debate 
between Vice President AI Gore and 
Gov. George W Bush, it was impossible 
to distinguish the two from a distance: 
dark suits with red ties and a grin. 
Nowadays it is the slight differences 
between the candidates that determine 
for whom a person would cast his vote. 

It is not their stoic stances on extreme 
issues that make the difference. 

Enter Ralph Nader, this election's 
front man for the Green Party. Nader is 
the most popular of the third party 
candidates, and according to a recent 
Reuters Poll has a possible 5 percent of 
the popular vote. 

Nader is not your typical modern 
presidential candi-
date . Unlike Bush 
and Gore, Nader is 
willing to take 
extreme stances on 
issues and has no 
fear of alienating 
those who do not 
agree with him. He 
is a crusader for 
what he believes in. 

With the two major party candi-
dates, their agendas and stances are 
carefully crafted so as not to alienate 
their respective core voters while at the 
same time reeling in the independent 
and swing voters from the other side. 
There. are literally dozens of advisers 
and assistants that helped mold Gore's 
and Bush's platforms to match their 
parties' agendas. 

Nader is not the puppet of a larger 
political party; he is the leader of a 
smaller one. 

The Green Party is one of the larger 
of the third partie~, not unlike the

A THIRD CHOICE 
Though the obvious candidate, a vote for Ralph Nader 
only jeopardizes the left's chance at an acceptable 
president and guarantees Bush's victory. 

By AUION NORRII 
Senior Staff Writer 

Every truly liberal Democrat drools 
at the thought of Green Party presi-
dential candidate Ralph Nader clean-
ing up at the voting booths this 
November. 

With issues such as universal health 
care, campaign 

could send Gov. George W. Bush 
straight to his inaugural addr~ss. 

With only about 5 percent support 
nationwide, Nader is an outsider in the 
public eye. It is the media that are 
responsible for Nader's low rates of 
support, for without news coverage or 
access to the debates, voters are not 
forced to consider his policy plans. As 

long as the media's 
finance reform and 
abusive global corpo-
rations on the tip of 
his tongue, Nader is 
undoubtedly attrac-
tive to liberal voters 
- not to mention 
the fact that he is in 
favor of abortion 
rights and supportive 

con 
obsession wi th Vice 
President AI Gore 
and Bush endures. 
the public will be 
unreceptive to 
Nader's platform for 
the simple fact that 
they probably know 
nothing about it. 

GUARDIAN OPINION 

of gay and lesbian marriage rights. 
Plain and simple, Nader is a 

Democrat magnet. 
However, as Nov. 7 approaches, 

Democrats must adopt a voting strate-
gy that many people would not nor-
mally consider appropriate: We should 
resist the tempting and valid urge to 
vote for the best candidate (Nader) and 
instead vote according to party lines. 

To many Democrats, this strategy 
will sound odd. If Nader is the best lib-
eral candidate, we should feel perhaps 
obliged to vote for th is refreshing 
choice. However. Nader-leaning 
Democrats must real ize that their 
departure from the Democratic Party 

So, American 
Mpolitics as usual" means that the 
opportunity for a third-party presiden-
tial candidate to win the White House 
is far from being just around the cor-
ner, unless someone, somewhere can 
convince voters and the media that 
Nader has a plan worth listening to. 

Achievi ng such a change in 
American voter and media mentality, 
however, would be nearly impossible. 
Throughout the 20th century, for 
eXample, it has been nearly unheard of 
for third-party politicians to receive the 
amount of news coverage enjoyed by 
Democrats and Republicans, and thus

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian 

The Unmaking of Monty Montezuma 
San Diego State University endures an unnecessary controversy 

SHANNON CASTlE 

All of you school-spirited types 
who lament the notable lack of 
crowds at UCSD sporting events 
finally have one thing to be happy 
about: at least you do not go to 
San Diego State University. 

While San Diego State is 
much older than our school and 
has historically turned out large 
crowds for football games, it 
made a bad choice when choos-
ing its mascot. 

SDSU's big mistake was in 
choosing a mascot and a nick-
name with nonfictional origins. [t 
should have known that, 60 years 
la ter, someone claiming ties to the 
Aztec empire would have a prob-
lem with it 

We, on the other hand, did just 
fine. 

UCS D's founders showed the 
wisdom of our institution in nam-
ing us the Tritons, after a fictional 
sea king. Unless we get a group of 
angry mer-people swimming out 
of the water in a few years, our 
name should be safe. . 

I'm still having a hard time 
understanding why anyone is 
offended by the Aztec nickname 
and SDSU's mascot, Monty 
Montezuma. 

The SDSU A.S. Council reso-
lution on the issue states that "A 
number of American universities 
adopted Native American mascots 

in the 1920s. ... Such mascots 
were frequently imbued with and 
justified by idealized and stereo-
typical characteristics (e.g. 
endurance, stamina, athleticism, 
bra very, modesty, feroci ty) .. . or 
on the grounds of 'tradition' or 
'ho.noring' indigenous peoples 

Though the school's repre-
sentation of the Aztecs may be a 
far cry from the true indigenous 
history of Mexico, [ do not see 
how idealizing a small part of a 
culture is a bad thing. I would 
have no problem having my 
European mutt ancestors depict-

. UCSD's founders, on the 
other hand, showed the 
wisdom ·of our institution 
in naming us the 
Tritons, after a fictional 
sea king. 
ed as brave and athletic, even if 
they were not. 

If the Native American 
Student Alliance really feels that 
the use of the Aztecs and Monty 
is "inappropriate, insensitive, 
inaccurate, and dehumanizing: I 
have an alternative for them to 
consider: the SDSU 
Conquistadors. Rather than 
Monty running around on the 
football field, th~ could have 
Heman Cortes ridmg around on 
a horse. slashing at the football 
players. The halftime show would 
be a re-enactment of a few smaIl-

pox epidemics. 
Unfortunately, the football 

crowd probably would not take 
too kindly to this modification. 
The whole reason we have mas-
cots and nicknames is that reality 
is not exciting enough to make 
people want to jump up and 
down and scream when players 
run around on a field. This is why 
no mascot, fictional or nonfic-
tional. including Monty 
Montezuma, is going to be an 
accurate portrayal of anything 
except the school. 

In short, [ see nothing dehu-
manizing in SDSU's positive, 
albeit stereotypical, portrayal of 
an Aztec warrior. 

If the Native American popu-
lation is concerned that true his-
tory and culture is being warped 
and lost because of this mascot, 
its present actions and com-
plaints are going to do linle to 
remedy the situation. Changing 
the mascot will not change any 
existing perceptions of the Aztecs 
and their present-day descen-
dants. . 

A better course of action 
would be to educate the public 
and SDSU students about the rest 
of the Aztec culture, the part they 
do not see on the football field. 

That said, I'd like to wish our 
Conquistador buddies at State 
the best of luck with their mas-
cot search. As for all of my 
UCSD compatriots, let's quit 
whining about the lack of school 
spirit and be happy we still have 
a mascot - at least until King 
Triton comes fighting for his 
honor.

Sitting Down With S~ 
Diego's Susan Davis 
Assemblywoman Susan Davis proves she 
is ready for Congress 

Opinion Editor 

£d#or's notr: An itattnMw with 
GOP candidate Brian Bilbray will 
appear in tilt Oct. 23 issut of the 
Guardian. 

[ first heard the name Susan 
Davis when I was working at the 
state Capitol in Sacramento three 
summers ago. Victoria Davis, 
then-Assemblyman Jim 
Cunneen's legislative director, 
offhandedly mentioned the name, 
explaining that Assemblywoman 
Susan Davis, a Democrat, repre-
sented the district in which UCSD 
is located. 

Victoria encouraged me to 
drop by Susan Davis' Capitol 
office to talk to her and perhaps 
even to get an intership at her 
district office in San Diego. 
Unfonunately, for some reason 
or another, I did not act on this 
advice. 

Fast-forward one-and-a-half 
years to winter quarter last school 
year. My friend invited me to join 
her at a student info night at 
Susan Davis' district office, just 
off Balboa Avenue. 

After serving six successful 
years in the California State 
Assembly and running into the 
wall of tcnn limits, Davis had 
decided to run for the 49th 
Congressional district against 
incumbent Brian Bilbray. 
Expecting beforehand, and cor-
~ so. a highly contested race, 
DaVIS was tryin~ to get coIIcge stu-
dents involved m the campaign by 

registering other students. orga-
nizing on-campus events and pro-
viding basic campaign necessities. 

lruthfully, [ came into the 
meeting not sure what to expect. I 
am a registered Republican myself 
and had worked on Sen. John 
McCain's presidential campaign 
and with Assemblymembers 
Cunneen and Jim Baning, all of 
whom are with the GOP. 

For all [ knew, Davis could have 
represented the extreme left. 
When [ left the meeting, though, 
and after speaking personally with 
her, [ was convinced beyond a 
shadow of a doubt that she was the 
candidate that [ would support. 
Davis has the rare ability to reach 
across the chasm that separates 
the two parties, using socially lib-
eral ideals coupled WIth economIc 
responsibility and conservatism. 

Over the summer, [ decided to 
help out on Davis' campaign. 
though not as often 8S I would 
have liked. [ did, however, get the 
chance to speak with her again 
and ask her some questions in an 
interview. 

I did this with the hopes of 
convincing you, just as [ became 
convinced, that Davis is the most 
qualified candidate to represent 
San Diego in Congress. 

I emphasize the fact that this 
congcssional race is very close and 
that its outcome could be deter-
mined by the number of UCSD 
students voting. Not only does it 
determine who represents San

Con: 
Votingfor NOiler means 
voting for Bush 
eonun. .. ".. ...... 
third-party candidates never 
receive the popular support 
enjoyed by major party politicians. 

Realistically, one would have to 
come inches short of inciting a 
political revolution to achieve a 
political system in this country that 
actually acknowledged third-party 
candidates such as Nader. And as 
talented as Nader's campaign man-
agers may be, it remains unlikely 
that the majority of Democrats 
would begin to consider Nader a 
real option during the very few 
weeks that remain lJcfore the elec-
tion. 

Consequently, the media's deci-
sion to ignore Nader means that 
voters remain unconvinced that he 
has enough public support to win, 
and thus, they refuse to support 
him. It is a twisted cycle, and it 
makes a Nader victory impossible 
this November. Simply put, the 
media's refusal to grant him atten-
tion means that this just is not 
Nader's year. 

'More importantly, because 
two parties dominate American 
politics, any left-wing, third-party 
candidate such as Nader will 
draw his votes from the more lib-
eral of the Democratic troupes. 
Today, as more Democrats con-
vert to Greens, the number of 
voters backing Gore will slowly 
drop. 

Meanwhile, a united, solid 
majority of Republican voters will 
launch Bush all the way to 1600 
Pennsylvania Ave., while the grow-
ing Greens and bifurcated 
Democrats will be left empty-
handed. 

Admittedly, if the media wel-
comed third-party candidates and 
it was thus remotely possible for 
Nader to win support as well as 
the election, liberal Democrats 
should not resist ·voting Green. 
However, until America can han-
dle making voting decisions that 
involve more than two options, 
Democrats cannot afford to 
divide into separate camps when 
Republicans remain neatly band-
ed together. 

Unfortunately, the seduction of 
Nader will probably prove irre-
sistible for many leftist Democrats, 
and these voters will claim to have 
held true to their political philoso-
phies by voting for him. 

Yet, if these Democrats were 
truly aware of the weight of their 
votes. they would acknowledge 
the effect that their departure 
from the Democratic Party could 
have on this election and 
American social policies, and they 
would wait to vote Green. [f they 
do not wait, these voters will be 
responsible for the election of a 
president that Democrats and 
Greens alike do not think America 
can afford. 

It is unfair, but this year, thtl 
media 's refusal to grant Nader a lit-
tle attention means that the issues 
of the election are less important 
than the politics behind it. 

On Nader's behalf, in four 
years he will have ideally garnered 
enough public support to con-
vince the media to acknowledge 
him, and maybe he will crush 
America's illogical attitude toward 
third-party candidates. Perhafs he 
will even launch that politica rev-
olution mentioned earlier and 
implant a multiparty system in the 
states 

If so, Nader would again be one 
of the best candidates on the bal-
lot, and that election would be one 
in which I would encourage 
Democrats to vote Nader. 

For now, however, Democratic 
voters should remain wary of sup-
porting his anractive agenda, not 
because there are holes in his poli-
cy ideas or political strategies, but 
because by voting Green this year, 
they will be enduring Bush for the 
next four. 

Pro: 
Nader represents 
impartant issues 
c.dI ...... rro. ...... 
Reform Party, which may be more 
well known. 

If Nader receives 5 percent or 
more of the popular vote in this 
election, the Green Party will 
qualify for matching federal 
funding from the Federal 
Election Com mince next elec-
tion. The additional funds would 
allow the Green Party to cam-
paign more vigorously in the next 
election. 

Nader is the Green Party's 
hope for the future. Nobody 
expects him to win the election, 
but enough votes will bring the 
Green Party into the polttical 
arena in a big way. 

This raises the question: Why 
do we need another major party? 
The answer is that the difference 
between the two main candidates 
has become so fuzzy that even 
when [ squinted at the television 
on Thesday evening, I could not 
tell the difference between them. 
Without the accent, Bush's ideas 
for Social Security and education 
might sound like a democratic 
proposal when taken out of con-
text. 

To listen to Joe Leiberman talk 

The UCSD Guardian 

about religion you would guess he 
was a Southern Republican. There 
is no left wing and there is no 
right wing. Today there is only a 
middle, and everyone is vying for 
the same votes. 

Only a few issues set the 
Republicans apart from the 
Democrats, and the American 
people. a~ getting shortchanged of 

. a real choice between two differ-
ent candidates. 

Elections have now become a 
personality contest. A good smile 
and an affable character might 
win the election regardless of the 
candidate'S opinions. A third 
major party would be an incentive 
for issues to take the limelight 
again. 

There are not just two sides to 
the issues, but a gradient of opin-
ions ranging frOm one extreme to 
another, with a middle ground in 
between. 

With the current trend of mov-
ing to the center, a third party 
would give voters the luxury of 
actually seeing a different view on 
the issue. A vote for Nader would 
be a vote for more choice in the 
future. 

For example: What if there 
were only two radio stations, one 
that played R & B and rap, and 
the other only rock' n' roll? These 
are two extremes that would 
probably satisfy a large majority, 
but what about the myriad of 

other genres? [ compare this to 
Democrats and Republicans. 
Nader brings a classical station 
into the mix. He brings a new 
extreme for people to choose 
from, and though it may not be 
the most popular choice, at least it 
would be an option, and in the 
end it could be a force that 
changes a few votes, and a few 
opinions as well. 

Why the Green Party? Why 
Nader? [t is not just because 
Nader represents an extreme and 
would create some turmoil, but 
because his political ideologies are 
all very positive and beneficial to 
society, especially to families and 
small businesses. 

Nader's name has always been 
associated with anti-establishment 
ideals. In a time when big busi-
nesses choose what we wear,listen 
to and watch, it is about time 
somebody spoke out against those 
huge megacorporations that con-
trol what people buy. 

[n a time when there is more 
than one Starbucks in a mall and 
when Microsoft is the maker of 
nearly every program on all com-
puters, there is not any room for 
the mom and pop businesses that 
used to carry a variety of original 
products. 

Nader is a strong opponent of 
big businesses, and a vote for him 
would show the rest of 
Washington that people are con-

OPINION 7 

cerned about the increasingly 
large role big businesses play in 
our lives. 

Nader is also a big advocate of 
environmentally friendly politics. 
Unlike Gore who says he is pro-
environment but owns stock in 
large oil companies, Nader walks 
the walk as much as he talks the 
talk. A vote for him is a vote for a 
cleaner environment and a nudge 
for whoever is to be elected to do 
the same. 

Nader is not a politician. but a 
representative of a portion of 
America that has no voice with 
the major parties. 

[ doubt it is possible to con-
vince any Bush supporters to vote 
for Nader, but for those of you 
that would like to vote for Nader, 
but are going to vote for Gore 
because a vote for Nader is a vote 
against Gore and for Bush, I urge 
you to think about this: The dif-
ferences between Gore and Bush 
are hardly visible. A vote for 
Nader is a vote for change. Not 
just a change in policies, but a 
change in the way our choices are 
made. 

Two choices just are not 
enough for our growing popula-
tion and varied, interests. There 
are too many opinions for just 
two candidates to represent 
everyone, and in a representative 
government like ours, that is a 
problem .

Davis: 
Challenger offers more 
than incumbent 

Diego in Washington D,C., but it 
may also chan8e the landscape of 
Congress. This IS an important race 
on the national level because the 
outcome may determine which 
political party controls the House of 
Representatives for the next two 
years.This power resides in the 
hands of the students here at 
UCSD, as there are enough votes 
here to determine the election. 

"I think it's critical," said Davis 
of the student vote, "I think stu-
dents need to feel that they have 
control over their future, It amazes 
me, actually, that students are will-
ing to give up their future to the 
votes of people who may not under-
stand [students') future needs. W 

Davis does not put all the weight 
on students' shoulders, however, as 
she understands the stress and 
pressure a student goes through, 
being a UC graduate herself. 

MAnybody who's in office must 
take some responsibility for that, 
because we obviously haven't 
reached [students) to help them 
feel that it really does matter who's 
in office.W 

Making a difference seems to be 
a focal point for Davis, particularly 
in the environment. She recently 
authored a bill that will preserve 
and protect California's wetlands, 
and also co-authored a law with 
Assemblyman Howard Wayne that 
provides ocean monitoring of pol-
lution. She also continues to sup-
port environmental education, 

"Environmental education is 
very important to me,w Davis said, 
"because I know that as we educate 
new generations of people, that 
they are much more concerned 
and much more aware of what a 
difference it makes in the life of a 
community if we preserve our 
resources. " 

An important issue for many stu-

Monday, October 9, 2000' 

dents is the neverending debate on 
abortion, A fervent protector of a 
woman's right to choose, Davis 
stands proudly behind her position, 

MIt has always been a line I 
would not cross,w she said of abor-
tion rights, "I'm 100 percent pro-
choice, always have been, always 
will be, I would bargain hard to 
make certain that choice becomes 
a major part of any 'issue, that we 
ensure the ability of women and 
their physicians to make medically 
necessary decisions." 

These issues - the environment 
and abortion rights - are perhaps 
the most important to students. But 
beyond these, Davis has joined 
forces with Gov. Gray Davis (no 
relation) to help ease. the burden of 
college tuition from students' 
shoulders. During her tenure in the 
Assembly, she has helped push 
through tuition freezes, new Cal 
Grants and better access to loans 
and scholarships for ,current and 
prospective college students. 

What stood out most in the 
interview was her commitment to 
San Diego, One of her most impor-
tant priorities in Congress, she says, 
is to obtain "a committee assigment 
that I think reflects San Diego." 
Education, health care and the mil-
itary are all important to San Diego, 
and are thus important to her. 

Through her six years in the 
Assembly, through her commit-
ment to her values, beliefs and sin-
cerity, Davis has proven herself 
worthy to represent San Diego on 
Capitol Hill. She has shown time 
and again she has not been spoiled 
by politics and remains on the 
same level as her constituents, 
which is more than people can say 
about most politicians, 

The future resides in our hands. 
Our votes can make the difference 
in this election, We can either vote 
for Davis' opponent, who like a tall , 
thin reed, sways whichever way the 
political winds blow, or for Davis, 
who stays committed and ground-
ed to her beliefs and the beliefs of 
those whom she represents. Let's 
make the most of it.

Proclaiming that the United 
States must dispel the "duopolyW of

Benjamin spoke to a sparse audi-
ence at the Price Center on 
Thursday afternoon as pan of the 
Students for Nader organization's 
efforts to introduce the values of 
the Green Party, 

. Giving speeches across the eight 
University of California campuses. 
Benjamin spoke of the beliefs of the 
Green Party and tried to explain its 
foundations and future aspirations 
in her 25 minute address. 

' Benjamin emphasized the simi-
larities between presidential candi-
dates George W. Bush and AI Gore 
and asked the audience to gauge its 
feelings toward the contenders. 

MArc any of you inspired by 
these two men? Do they make you 
think, 'Oh, I can't wait until they're 
president?'W Benjamin said. 

Capitalizing on cleverly worded

Benjamin's address and expects an 
increase in student interest in the 
Students for Nader organization. 

"I think her speech was articu-
late and focused directly on the 
issues.M Sachs said. "She made an 
excellent case for voting Green, 
voting for Nader and for herself. We 
could have had a better tumout but 
we're a young organization and we 
expect a better turnout at our next 
event.w 

A question and answer session 
followed Benjamin's speech, 
prompting her to explain the differ-
ences between herself and Dianne 
Feinstein on major issues. She also 
discussed the ramifications behind 
students' voting for Nader and how 
that could help disrupt the two-
party system by guaranteeing him 
federal funds to participate in the 
next election, 

David Leland, a graduate stu-

dent and the tabling coordinator of 
Students for Nader, said students 
should become involved with polit-
ical organizations in order to 
remain aware of the issues affecting 
them. 

"We have to work to dispel the 
myth that students today are apa-
thetic or apolitical,w Leland said. "It 
is important for them to be 
involved so that they can't be pla-
cated with cell phones and video 
games into ignoring the, things in 
the world that are bad." 

Leland was undaunted by the 
small audience assembled before 
Benjamin, noting that the Students 
for Nader organization had only 
officially existed for two days. 

Mllove the way she speaks, and I 
wasn't too surprised by the atten-
dance since we just registered as a 
student organization two days ago, 
and we quickly pulled together at 
the grass roots level," Leland said. 

According to Benjamin, the 
Green Party and organizations such 
as Students for Nader have the 
potential to reform the current 
two-party political system; however, 
Benjamin admits that thl're 
remains "a hell of a lot of work to

On Day One, Kostunica Faces Myriad of 
Troubles in Consolidating Power 

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -
Yugoslav President Vojislav 
Kostunica struggled Sunday, his 
first day in office, LO consolidate 
his authority over Serbia and his 
own allies, trying to find a bal-
ance between revolutionary jus-
tice and legality in the post-
Milosevic era. 

Kostunica is president, but 
some in the 18-party coalition 
that backed him are afraid that his 
concern for legal niceties may 
prove costly in the uneasy vacuum 
of power that has followed 
Siobodan Milosevic's ouster. 

Already, there have been seri-
ous behind-the-scenes struggles 
for control of the police, the 
COUItS, the banking system and 
customs authorities. 

Control of the police forces is a 
significant issue here. The police 
did not in any serious way oppose 
the mass protest last Th ursday 
that led to the burning of the fed-
eral parliament, helped along by 
some prior agreements made by 
key commanders with the opposi-
tion. 

[n Sunday's issue of Politika, 

the leading daily newspaper, 
Zoran Djindjic, head of the 
Democratic Party, the backbone 
to the opposition, said the police 
uhad reorganized, stabilized and 
realized what the interest of the 
people is, and the police have 
become practically immune to 

The appointment caused 
such uproar among the 
opposition leaders 
themselves that it was 
rescinded the same day 

orders that could bring them into 
confl ict with the people." 

But knowledgeable officials say 
that former police and security 
officials with connections to 
Djindjic attempted to take control 
of Belgrade police headquaners 
on Friday morning and again 
Sunday morning With the inter-
vention this morning of Kostunica 
himself, it appears to have been 
calmed, officials said. 

On Sunday, Kostunica met pri-
vately with top security officials. 

On Friday, at the lucrative cus-
toms department, a close 
Milosevic ally, Mihalj Kenes, was 
pressured by armed men working . 
for the opposition to leave office. 
To the surprise of Kostunica and 
some allies, a businessman close 
to Djindjic who owns an import 
company, was named head of cus-
toms. 

The appointment caused such 
an uproar among the opposition 
leaders themselves that it was 
rescinded the same day. 

There was another incident at 
the courts, with senior Milosevic 
judges ordering the destruction of 
documents relating to controver-
sial cases. 

There was a similar incident at 
the Foreign Ministry, though of 
lesser importance. 

Kostunica and his allies are 
also trying to assert control over 
the Serbian government and par-
liament, which did not go through 
new elections.

Big Bookstores are Halting Discounts 
and Raising Their Pri~es 

Fifteen years ago, a handful of 
fast-growing national bookstore 
chains started a price war in dis-
counting books that became one 
of the momentous trends in the 
book business. 

Widespread markdowns on 
best sellers, tens of thousands of 
other hardcover titles and even 
paperbacks delighted consumers 
and increased book sales. 

The low prices lured cus-
tomers to the national chai ns 
from independent stores and 
pumped up best sellers' sales by 
making them much cheaper than 
other titles. And when 
Amazon.com joined the game five 
years ago, its online bookstore 
upped the ante on competitive 
discounts. 

But this year the discount era 
in the bookstore business has vir-
tually come to an end. With none 
of the fanfare surrounding new 
markdowns, the dominant book-
store chains, 

Barnes & oble and Borders, 
have quietly raised their prices. 
Similarly, large online stores 
such as Amazon .com, 
Barnesandnoble.com, and 
Borders.com, just a year after 

their discounts of up to 50 per-
cent on best-selling books esca-
lated the price wars to a new 
height. 

As a result, consumers every-
where are paying more for books. 
Publishers stand to see the already 
sluggish growth in book sales suf-
fer from the sharp increase in 
retail prices. 

But independent bookstOres, 

The bookstore chains say 
they rolled back their 
discounts because of 
rising costs, slowing 
growth rates and the 
wisdom of experience. 
bloodied by 15 years of struggling 
to compete against the chains' 
discounts, are breathing a sigh of 
relief. 

The bookstore chains say they 
rolled back their discounts 
because of rising costs, slowing 
growth rates and the wisdom of 
experience. 

The price increases at the 
online stores are particularly sig-
nificant, however, because of their 
implications about the future of 
Internet book-selling. Although 
less than 5 percent of consumer 
book sales last year were made 
through the Internet, online sales 
were the fastest-growing part of 
the business. 

Amazon.com in May last year 
began selling books on The New 
York Times best-seller lists at 50 
percent off the cover price. [n 
addition, it sold most other hard-
cover books at 30 percent off and 
most trade paperbacks at 20 per-
cent off. 

BarnesandNoble.com, the sec-
ond-largest online bookstore, and 
Borders' online store immediately 

. matched Amazon.com's prices. 
This summer, however, as 

investors battered its stock, 
Amazon.com raised all its book 
prices, according to publishers' 
sales executives. 

Last week, Amazon.com's 
prices were 10 percent higher 
across the board.

His aim appeared to be to steer 
Arabs towa rd policies reflecting the 
harsh lessons learned on the four 
occasions since 1948 when bitter-
ness flared into conflicts that all 
ended with overwhelming Israeli 
victories. 

uDeciaring a war is not some-
thing simple: Mubarak said in 
remarks to Egyptian reporters. "We 
are in a very grave situation which 
demands a wise reaction." 

In what appeared to be a refer-
ence to statements by hard-line 
Arab leade"rs who have called for 
military attacks on Israel, including 
the Iraqi president, Saddam 
Hussein, and the Libyan leader, 
Col. Moammar Gadhafi, Mubarak 
said peace was "still possible· if 
Arab nations " use reason and stop 
outbidding ourselves' with hard-
line statements. 

Mubarak's remarks follow a 
series of interviews in recent days 
in which he made some of his most 
hostile remarks about Israel in his 
19 years as president. On Egyptian 
television on Friday, he accused 
[srael of using "excessive force"

"stand up against the world." 

On Thursday, he told Egypt's 
army newspaper that the peace 
deal that Washington had been 
urging on Palestinians, involving 
[s raeli sovereignty ove~ most of 
Jerusalem, "would be a time bomb 
that would explode in the faces of 
us all ." 

For days, Arab capitals, includ-
ing Cairo, have been roiled by 
street . protests involving large 
crowds, as well as campus protests 
and bitter denunciations of Israel 
by leaders, including many like 
Mubarak who have forged relation-
ships with [srael. 

[n many ways the mood has 
seemed like a throwback to the 
period before the Oslo peace 
accords of 1993, when antagonism 
for [srael often seemed like the only 
enduring political bond between 
Arab nations. 

One of the largest protests took 
place on Sunday in the Arab 
Nation of Morocco which has the 
closest ties to Israel. More than 
half a million people, including 
the prime minister, Abderrahman 
Youssoufi , marched through the

Califomia's 36th House District Race Remains Too Close to Call 
MANHATIAN BEACH, Calif. 

- Except for a few placards and a 
scattering of advertisements on 
cable television, there is almost no 
readily visible evidence that an 
election is being held this fall in 
California's 36th District 
Congressional District. 

The sunny ocean-side strip of 
Beach Boys country, from just 
south of Santa Monica to just 
north of Long Beach. 

Still, a hot political battle is 
being waged in the 36th, one that is 
expected to go down to the wire 
and play an important role in 
deciding which party ends up con-
trolling the House. 

The two candidates; Steven 
Kuykendall, the Republican 
incumbent, and Jane Harman, his 
Democratic challenger, are having 
at each other daily, trying to gain 
traction even if lIttle attention is 
being paid . 

Polls indicate that of the 52 
House races in California this 
year, th is one might be the closest, 
and might be decided by many of 
the same tax, health care, educa-
tion and Social Security issues 
that are at .play in the presidential 
race.

dent. It also has a history of swing-
ing from one side to the other. [t 
tends mostly to be moderate on 
social, cultural and environmental 
issues, and conservative on fiscal 
issues. 

Kuykendall, who is more mod-

erate than many California 
Republicans, because of the mod-
erate tilt of the 36th, won the seat 
two years ago by just 2 percentage 
points. Harman, who is also a mod-! 
erate Republican, held the seat for 
three terms from 1992 to 1998, 
before leaving to run unsuccessful-
ly for governor. 

Both candidates have raised 
well over $1 million in campai$,n 
funds, and both say they eaSIly 
could end up spending more than 
$2 million, about double what 
House candidates usually spend 
in California. 

Considerable outside money 
also is being spent on the race by 

special interest groups and by vari-
ous campaign committees of the 
national political parties, and 
national party figures have been 
visiting to help the candidates raise 
even more money. 

Most nonpartisan political ana-
lysts consider the contest a com-
plete tossup. 

"The slightest political breeze 
over the next month could nudge 
either candidate to victory: said 
Amy Walter, who follows House 
contests for the Cook Political 
Report.

Students seek advice for their 
friends or cou nseling regarding a 
sexual assault that happened in 
high school, before the student set 
foot on the UCSD campus. 

Also, according to Wahlig, the 
crime must be reported to the 
authorities where it happened. If a 
student lives in Pacific Beach and is 
assaulted there, the police depart-
ment in that area of San Diego 
would be responsible for taking the 
report. 

The UCSD Medical Ce.nter in 
Hillcrest does not report any crime 
statistics to the main campus police 
department, making it more diffi-
cult to determine the accuracy of 
the statistics. 

With her wealth of information 
about sexual crimes, Wahlig was 
hesitant and pensive before saying 
that UCSD is a urelatively" safe 
campus. 

The key word is urelatively: 
according to Jones. 

The Clery law is named after 
Jeanne Clery, a Lehigh University 
freshman who 'was raped and 
strangled in 1986 by another stu-
dent in her dorm room. Her par-
ents found out later that the 
Pennsylvania University had not 
accurately reported its sexual 
assault statistics.

14 FEATURES The UCSD Guardian 

The Editor's Soapbox 
An editor conveys his frustration with the contiuned mistreatment of~kateboarders 
By DAVID PILZ 
Photo Editor 

When I was a kid, I saw stickers 
everywhere that ' said, 
"Skateboarding is not a' crime." 
Ever since the birth of skateboard-
ing, skateboarders have been treat-
ed with an extreme amount of 
undeserved disrespect by the gen-
eral public. I bring up the issue 
now in light of new anti-skate-
boarding laws, and also due to the 
skate-proofing of UCSD. 

I am not into skateboarding all 
that much. I skate around every 
once in a while, but I'm not a pro-
fessional. A few months ago, some 
friends and I were skateboarQing at 
a local school, having a good time, 
when we were busted. After much 
harassment, we were released with 
warnings. This is when I discovered 
there are laws against skateboard-
ing. 

Skateboarding is no longer 
allowed on city property. In fact, 
the only place you are allowed to 
skate is in skate parks or on your 
own property. The problem is that 
skate parks are too few and far 
between. They cost a lot of money 
to get.in and are generally over-
crowded. What about the kids who 
don 't have a way to get to skate 
parks, or someone who cannot 
afford to get in? What does the city 
of San Diego have to say to them 
- "Get a new hobby?" 

Furthermore, there is a differ-
ence between ramp skating and 
street skating. They vary and are 
fun in their own ways. 

I was in shock when I flrst heard 
about the anti-skateboarding laws. 

No skateboarding anywhere? I 
couldn't believe it. Not on side-
walks, not at schools, not even on 
the streets. No grinds, rail slides, 
kickflips, heeltlips or varia Is. Even a 
mere ollie is illegal. Skateboarding 
down the street to your friend's 
house warrants a ticket or an arrest 
in San Diego. 

The arguments anti-skate-
boarders make are that skateboard-
ing makes too much noise and that 
it destroys property. Come on now. 
Skateboarding is no louder than 
someone rollerblading or dribbling 
a basketball. People walking down 
the street talking are as loud as 
skateboarders. 

As for destruction of property, 
when my friend and I were bust-
ed, the police said we were caus-
ing structural damage. This is 
absolutely false. Thin pieces of 
wood cannot destroy those 
cement ledges we were skating 
on. 

Then the police said, "What 
about the kids who have to see 
these ledges every day?" I'm guess-
ing that the kids either don't care 
or they are skating on the ledges 
themselves. 

I can understand if we are talk-
ing about some really snazzy busi-
ness plaza, but cement ledges at 
schools, which are ugly to begin 
with? Sidewalk curbs? The whole 
city of San Diego? 

Let's face it, these are sad 
excuses for justifying skateboard-
ing laws, the real reason behind 
which is the stigma attached to 
skateboarders. Skateboarders are 
seen as hoodlums, vandals a:nd 
punks up to no good, when they 

Maybe you have rwticed 
those really ugry bumps 
all over the ledges and 
benches in Revelle, No, 
that wasn't done to make 
the school look better, 
obviously/ it was done to 
prevent skateboarders 
from sliding anywhere, 
are really just people trying to 
have a good time. Of course, there 

. are those that give skateboarders a 
bad name, like those who vandal-
ize, but skateboarding isn't the 
only sport with people like this. 
There are plenty of rollerbladers 
who act the same way, as well as 
basketball players, football players 
and bikers. I don't mean to give 
anyone a bad name; I'm just say-
ing that there are idiots every-
where, and not just in skateboard-
ing. 

I don't know how this anti-

skateboarder stigma began, nor 
why it has persevered throughout 
the history of skateboarding. It is at 
the center of the recent aggression 
against skateboarders and has got 
to go. 

It is because of this stigma that 
my friend and I were treated so 
disrespectfully by the police when 
we were busted . For instance, 
after asking me if I had any 
weapons on me, the police 
searched me just to make sure. 
Weapons? I don't even own a 
pocketknife. And of course, it is 
really easy to skate with a gun in 
my back pocket, just in case I 
need to shoot someone in the 
middle of a grind. 

We're not criminals. We're 
UCSD students just trying to have 
some good clean fun. What we did 
was no basis for the way we were 
treated. 

Maybe you have noticed those 
really ugly bumps all over the 
ledges and benches at Revelle. No, 
that wasn't done to make the 
school look better, obviously; it was 
done to prevent skateboarders 
from sliding anywhere. Why is this 
problem considered so big that the 
administration put money and 
effort into making sure no one 
skateboards there? I don't buy this 
whole "noise" argument. 
Apparently our whole campus is 
supposed to be dead quiet all the 
time. Contrary to popular belief, 
our campus is not a library. 

You 'would think San Diego 
would encourage skateboarding. 
It doesn 't cost the city anything if 
skateboarding is legal. Basketball 
requires building basketball 

• 

Monday, October 9, 2000 

courts, football and baseball 
require fields, but you don 't need 
to build anything for street skat-
ing. Skateboarders use the exist-
ing structures as courts and the 
open roads as fields. We don't 
need the city to spend millions of 
dollars to suit our skateboarding 
needs. 

The thing that bothered me the 
most about being busted for skate-
boarding was that there were sever-
al k.ids around; also skateboarding, 
who . were watching us do tricks 
and cheering us on. I believe that 
we are good role models for them 
- UCSD students with positive 
attitupes getting good grades. 
. The cops came and turned us 
into criminals. r guess the city of 
San Dieso would rather have those 
kids. sittmg at home, watching TV 
and playing video games, than have 
them outside skateboarding. 

Some of my fondest memories 
Of youth were of skateboarding 
around town with my brother and 
friends, exploring and getting some 
exercise. Skateboarding is a very 
positive sport, especially for kids. 
and it makes me sad that people are 
trying hard to get rid of it. 

I am absolutely sick of laws 
designed to destroy young people's 
fun . Skateboarders aren't harming 
anyone. We are just tying to have 
some good clean fun . Apparently 
this is not acceptable to some 
uptight people who consider only 
the stereotype of skateboarders, 
and not the positive aspects skate-
boarding has to offer. 

The truth is, we like skateboard" 
ing. We like it a lot. It's a lot of fun . 
We are going to keep doing it.

Vegetarian: 
Health amcerns involved 
in diet cJwice 
ContInued fro. ..... 13 
Vegans are vegetarians who have 
decided to stop both consuming 
and using all animal products, 
including milk, cheese, eggs, other 
dairy items, wool, silk and leather. 

While some may think that it 
takes a lot of time to become a veg-
etarian, it is actually common for 
people to instantly make the 
lifestyle change, according to the 
Vegetarianism in a Nutshell Web 
site, http://wwwvrg.org /nuJshelVnUl-
sheU.htm. 

According to the Web site:. many 
people simply give up meat, fish 
and poultry overnight. It does not 
disclaim the fad that it does take 
some people more time to make 
the change. 

They advise that people w~nting 
• to make the change should make it 

at their own pace. According to the 
site, "Being a vegetarian is as hard 
or as easy as you ch~se to make it. 
Some people enjoy planning and 
preparing elaborate meals, while 
others opt for quick and easy vege-
tarian dishes: 

WHY BECOME A W8ETARlAN? 
There are several reasons for 

Mon., Oct. 11, 2:30pm 

becoming a vegetarian. Some peo-
ple make the choice because they 
are concerned about their health, 
religious issues or ecological 
issues. 

Others choose to become vege-
tarians because of a dislike of meat, 
compassion for animals, belief in 
nonviolence and economic con-
cerns. 

CAN A VHI1'AIIIAN DID .. 
UNllULtIIY? 

Although some people may 
argue that vegetarians are denied 
essential vitamins and minerals by 
abstaining from meat, all scientif-
ic evidence points to a'well-bal-
anced vegetarian diet as being 
healthy. 

The American Dietetic 
Association has affirmed that a 
vegetarian diet can meet all of a 
person's nutrient needs. The 
Vegetarianism in a Nutshell Web

While some people may 
think that it would be 
hard to find a place to 
take a vegetarian out to 
eat; there are many foods 
out there available to 
vegetarians, as many 
restaurants now carry 
vegetarian menus. 

cerns surrounding vegetarians are 
their intakes of proteins, iron, cal-
cium and vitamm B12. 

"Position of The American 
Dietetic Association: Vegetarian 
Diets; which was published in the 
Journal for the American Dietetic 
Association in November of 1997, 
states that vegetarians can easily 
meet their protein needs if they 
simply eat a varied diet and con-

sume enough calories to maintain 
their weight. It also says that a mix-
ture of proteins throughout the day 
will provide enough ess~ntial 
amino acids. 

Good sources of protein for 
vegetarians include lentils, tofu, 
low,fat I dairy products, nuts, 
seeds, tempeh and peas. Foods 
such as whole grain bread, ·greens. 
pasta and com also provide pro-
tein. 

Vegetarians concerned about 
iron intake should consume such 
foods as dried beans, spinach, 
chard, beet greens, blacltstrap 
molasses. blugur, prune juice and 
dried fruits. Cooking food in iron 
cookware also adds to iron intake. 
Eating food that is high in vitamin 
C also increases the body's ability 
to absorb iron during a meal. 

Calcium is a big conCern for 
vegetarians, particularly for veg-
ans. Vegetarians can still get their 
calcium intake from dairy prod-
ucts such as milk, cheese and 
cream. 

Vegans have to look elsewhere 
for their calcium source. Many 
vegans opt for calcium pills. 
Others cat foods high in calcium. 
such as collard greens, broccoli, 
kale, turnip greens, tofu prepared 
with calcium, and fortified soy 
milk. 

Since vitamin 8-12 comes pri-
marily from animal-derived foods,

it can be hard for vegetarians to 
find a source of it. Luckily for 
mature vegetarians, the adult rec-
ommendation for vitamin 8-12 is 
very low. A diet with dairy products 
or eggs can provide sufficient vita-
min 8-12 for vegetarians. Vegans 
can look to fortified foods such as 
Grape Nuts. some brands of nutri-
tional yeast and soy milk, or some 
soy analogs. There are also supple-
ments that can be taken for vitamin 
8-12. 

There are some questions as to 
whether a vegetarian diet is 
appropriate, or even healthy, for a 
child. 

According to The American 
Dietetic Association, vegetarian 
diets meet all nitrogen and amino 
acid needs fo~ growth. For chil-
dren who are becoming vegans, 
The American Dietetic 
Association recommends a well-
planned diet that should include 
fortified soy milk.

While some people may think 
that it would be hard to find a 
place to take a vegetarian out to 
eat, there are many foods out 
there available to vegetarians, as 
many restaurants now carry vege-
tarian menus.

..... (March 21-April19) 
Changes take place Monday and 

Tuesday. Don't take action then. 
Wait to see how things develop so 
you can push forward Wednesday 
and Thursday. By Friday you should 
run into opposition. You should 
already have your plan well under-
way by then. Postpone travel this 
weekend and get your financial 
affairs into order instead. 

T ..... (April ~May 20) 
Your money is in a state of flux 

on Monday and Tuesday. You're 
not sure of the income and expens-
es yet. Find out before making any 
agreements. On Wednesday and 
Thursday you're pushed to handle 
somebody else's emergency. No 
point in getting stressed. Stay calm 
as· you wrap uf loose ends on 
Friday, and you'l help others calm 
down, too. Save this weekend for 
your favorite private indulgences. 

....... (May 21-June 21) 
Although you've got the expe-

rience, others have good ideas, too. 
Together. you can solve a problem 
at work on Monday and Tuesday. 
You should do the planning 
Wednesday and Thursday so the 
others will know what to do. 
Follow through Friday on plans 
you've already made. Go through 
your closets over the weekend and 

get rid of stuff. you don't need. 
Some of it's still good. Thm a tidy 
profit with a garage sale, too. 

C- (June 22·July 22) 
Postpone travel on Monday 

and Tuesday. Gening a message 
across might even be hard, and 
things could get lost in the mail. 
The pace quickens on Wedncsclay 
and Thursday as new orders come 
in. Don't let anything stack up; 
you'll need the room to untangle a 
mess on Friday. Hide out with 
friends over the weekend. Do 
something fun that's free. Nobody 
can afford to spend much money. 

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22) 
Help your team get the money 

it needs on Monday and Thesday. 
Don', give up if your first four or 
five tries are fruitless. You may not 
see results until Wednesday. A lit-
tle planning can save a lot of rac-
ing back and forth on Thursday 
and Friday. Spend time with your 
folks over the weekend. They need 
to catch up on the gossip, and you 
don't want them to get it second-
hand. 

VIrP (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) 
Your panner's in a bit of a tizzy 

on Monday and Tuesday. Do what 
you can to help out. Be careful 
shopping on Wednesday and 
Thursday. Money will be burning 
a hole in your pocket. Take care of 
old business on Friday SO you can 
relax with a clear conscience over 
the weekend. Visit with neighbors 
over the weekend, but schedule a 
long trip for another time. 

IJIn (Sept. 23-Oct. 23) 
You're creative on Monday 

and Tuesday, but concentrating is 
hard. Try not to make a big mess 
as you put together 'Your master-
piece. On Wednesday and 
Thursday somebody wants to 
make decisions for you. Make sure 
they're doing it right. Friday is 
pretty chaotic. You could make a

friends could be fun. Plans won't 
be followed, though, 50 toss them. 
Over the weekend romance is dif-
ficult and money is tight. 

....... (Oct. 24-Nov. 21) 
Monday and Tuesday you're 

interested in love, but too many 
things get in the way. You might 
not make the connection until late. 
Wednesday and Thursday are 
busy. Don't make a date for then; 
you might not even have time for 
lunch. Tempers are shon on 
Friday. Don't schedule meetings 
with people you don't like; you're 
liable to tell them what you really 
think. Over the weekend scttIe into 
the safety of your family, where you 
can speak freely. 

.......... (Nov. 22-Dec. 21) 
You'll run into lots of argu-

ments Monday and Tuesday. This 
is good. It'll help you polish your 
presentation. Take action 
Wednesday and Thursday in 
romance and business dealings. 
You've rehearsed ",hat to say, 50 
it'll be effortless. On Friday you're 
sharp. and that's good. You may 
have to be. You're mentally 
fatigued this weekend. Evaluate 
your progress and do more plan-
ning with close friends.

Others can't decide what they 

want you to do on Monday and 
Tuesday. If you can figure it out, 
you might make a tidy profit Watch 
for accidents around the house on 
Wednesday and Thursday. Don't 
run with scissors - or let anybody 
elsc. An older person's confusion 
could upset you on Friday. 'Dy not 
to let somebody else's troubles get 
under your skin. There's too much 
fun this weekend. Schedule some 
private tim~ too.

On Monday get a message out 

to .a person far away. The money's

the LECTURE 

almost there, but not quite. It will 
be, soon. On Thesday be careful 
not to say too much. You don't 
want to unwittingly help the com-
petition. Good friends are on your 
side Wednesday and Thursday. Go 
ahead and use them. The pace 
quickens on Friday. Delegate as 
much as possible. Stick close to 
home over the weekend and do 
what others ask. Your same old 
routine is relaxing. 

...... (Feb. 19-M8Ich 20) 
Seems like everything you try 

on Monday docsn't work. Don't 
give up or get depressed. By 
Thcsday others wifl be more 
encouraging. The costs are higher 
than you thought on Wednesday 
and Thursday, but more money's 
coming in, too. Your talent may 
finally be rewarded. Watch 
expenses on Friday. Spend as little 
as possible. Stick dose to home on 
Saturday and Sunday. Instead of

Many famous people have 
been vocal about vegetarianism. 

Albert Einstein once said, 
"Nothing will benefit human 
health and increase the chances 
for survival of life on Eanh as 
much as the evolution to a vegetar-

Henry David Thoreau also 
spoke out in favor of vegetarian-

that it is part of the destiny of the 
human race in its gradual 
improvement to leave off eating 
animals."

/J.,"e l.!!inceton Review 

Monday, October 9, 2000 

Water Polo: 
Triton continue to roll 
with big win 

better than us. Our guys just played 
better today. [t was real team 
effort." 

An interesting side note to 
Saturday's game is its recruitment 
undertones. Ptpperdine and UCSD 
compete for recruits, and 
Pepperdine has the edge because of 
its ability to offer scholarships. This 
game might do something to 
change that. 

Their win against Pepperdine 
gives the Thtons a huge boost 
going into ' the coming weekend, 
when they will face UC Santa 
Barbara and Long Beach State. 

·We have not beat UCSB on the 
road in a long time,· Harper said. 
"This is going to be tough match. 
They have a real home court 
advantage. Long Beach is a real 
tough place to win also.· 

The Tritons' next home game 
is Oct. 28 at 11 a.m. against the 
UCSD alumni. The alumni were 
out in force at the Pepperdine 
game, perhaps sizing up the com- . 
petition, and the action looks to 
be fierce when these two squads 
meet up. Come out and see the 
old geezers give it a go. 

Soccer: 
Home sweet home for 
women's soccer 
ContI ..... froIII ..... 28 
people. 

"The other teams are more 
physical than we are," McManus 
said. "And that's the problem we've 
got .. [ think we play good soccer 
and we compete well. We've gotta 
get loose to the physical side. 
That's going to happen ell the 
time." 

The Tritons are in the thick of 
things in the CCAA with a 7-2 
league record and 8-2 overall. 

V-ball: 
Two more womens are 
under UCSp's belt 
ContIMed froIII ..... 28 
tions, with 9 and 8 kills respective-
ly. Santerre also helped out with 7 
kills of her own. Punelli also had 17 
digs, while teammate Denelle 
Smalley had 10 digs of her own. 

Karla Tate was the lone bright 
spot for the opposition , as she had 
a match- high 10 kills fo r the 
Pomona-ites, whose record fe ll to 
7 -4 in conference play.

Women's Cross Country Show Their Heart 
uc Irvine backs out of the meet but the Triton women take 4 of the top 6 spots to beat SDSU 
By ISAAC PEARlMAN 
Contributing Sports Writer 

On a cold, gray Saturday morn-
ing, while most students were 
sleeping after a long Friday night, a 
group of dedicated athletes got up 
early to run 5,000 meters at 
UCSD's nonh campus course. The 
women's cross country team was 
rewarded for its efforts with a :lS-
30 victory over visiting San Diego 
State University. The Tritons dom-
inated on their home course, nab-
bing four of the top six spots en 
route to victory. 

The Tritons were led by fresh-
man Laurel Casey, who came in 
second overall, with a time of 
21 :03. Fellow freshmen Julie ·Pope 
and Bridget Benino each ran a 
21 :07, tying for third. Carol 
Schwcichler (21 : ~S) occupied sixth 
place, while Erin Uyeshima (22:56) 
came in 10th and Cecilia Romo 
(23:32) earned 12th place. 

sDsu's Amanda Vielbaum ran 
a 20:53 to earn first place in the 
individual com petition, although 
Casey did not make it easy for her. 
After Casey had foiled four 
attempts by Vielbaum to break 
away, she was outdistanced by 

Vielbaum's burst of speed at the 
end. 

UC Irvine was unable to field a 
men's or women's team for what was 
origina lly going to be a race between 
it and UCSD, which left the men 's 
cross country team without an 
opponent and the women with an 
unexpected match against SDSU. 

"The women adjusted to the sit-
uation very well." said head coach 
Ted Van Arsdale. "They were out-
standing." 

Both teams entered their "B" 
teams in the race, and the six 
UCSD freshmen overmatched the 
lady Aztecs. The freshmen are an 
integral part of the young Triton 
team, which boasts only three 
upperclassmen. 

After Saturday'S victory and the 
team 's strong showing in the 
Bronco Invitational on Oct. 3, 
during which it placed o. 4 out 
of 15 teams, the women are run-
ning strong just in time for the 
UCS D Triton Invitational this 
Saturday. The team looks forward 
to meeting SDSU again at the 
invita tional , as well as facing 
Concordia, who came in two spots 
ahead of the Tritons at the Bronco 
Invitational.

s.derre captains Volleyball Water Polo Wms 8-3 
Laura Santerre's leadership both on and off the court has helped 
propel the Triton women's volleyball team to success this year 

. In a game that pitted two top-10 teams 
UCSD harned Pepperdine to a loss 

IJ JDllCA IUIUSIWIP 
Contributing Sports Writer 

Women's volleyball co-captain 
Laura Santerre, leading in both 
kills and cheerleading. keeps her 
tough attitude by believing that 
the Thtons are strong in every cat-
egory and proving that in every 
game. 

"We know that we can beat 
anyone; Santerre said. 

The third-year psychology 
major came to UCSD after a high 
school volleyball career in 
Arizona, and stepped into an 
institution which has fit her per-
sonality and skills well. 

The 5'8" outside hitter has 
faced players on the other side of 
the net who are over six feet tall 

[n response, Santerre has 
played taller than she is, accord-
ing to head coach Duncan 
McFarland. 

, "The bigger the challenge she 
faces, the more she steps up." 
McFarland said. "This year she 
has· accepted a much bigger role 
and has risen to the position: 

According to Santerre, she 
enjoys the leadership position and 
tries to be an example for her 
teammates. 

She likes to stay focused, have 
fun and prove to the other teams 
that the Tritons are a strong 
force. 

New to Division II, the Thtons . 
have faced more difficult matcl1es 
this season, but have still main-
tained a second-place ranking in 
the California Collf$iate Athletic 
Association. The poSItion, howev-
er, only came after the California 
State University San Bernardino 

game in which Santerre had 16 
kills. three service aces and 10 
digs. 

"[Santerre) needs to be an all-
around player, and so far she is 
steadily getting better and has 
not let us down: McFarland 
said. 

He went on to say that she has 
approached the game with focus 
and is contributing in every cate-
gory to enable die team to win. 

Santerre's strength is obvious 
on the court, but ner spirit stays 
with the team from the sidelines if 

UI love the girls on the 
team. As a freshman, the 
team and the Triton 
spirit both on and off the 
court was so fun. " 

-...,......,. 
Triton volleyball player 

she is out of the game. 
The fun diminished a bit last 

year. When she was about to step 
into a starting position, Santerre 
sprained her ankle and was side-
lined for two weeks. 
Demonstrnting her commitment 
to the game, she continued train-
ing in the weight room and 
attendedJractices and games. The 
injury di not stop Santerre from 
being a presence on the team and 
firing up every player as much as 
she could, according to 
McFarland. 
. "Nothing got to her. She 
stayed a vocal person on the team 
and managed to push people to 

keep winning." McFarland said. 
·This may be a reason that 

Santerre so genuinely cares about 
the team. She has exploded into 
this season and rallied all the play-
ers to set themselves up for a 
tough season. 

"This last week was huge and [ 
knew that we all had to stay 
focused for those games: 
Santerre said. "[f we always keep 
improving, working and playing 
harder, and still have fun, then it 
can be done." 

Having joined the Thtons this 
season, setter Jennifer Badran-
Grycan Icnows the transition into 
college volleyball has been made 
easier by Santerre. 

"What makes her a good co-
captain is that she is always push-
ing us and cheering us on; 
Badran-Grycan said. "(Santerre) 
gives over 100 percent constantly, 
and it makes the rest of us want 
to, too." 

if someone makes a mistake, 
Santerre helps her to forget and 
look to the next set, serve or spike. 
Everyone is made to feel like an 
integral member, according to 
Badran-Grycan. This makes the 
adaptation to the new opponents 
in Division II easier. 

Santerre does not think about 
how she is leading in kills, or how 
constantly her statistics contain 
double digits in every category. 
She focuses on enjoying the game 
and playing with as much effort as 
possible. 

"All of us get fired up because 
she is so intense and is always 
there for us, which is why we all 
have so much fun; Badran-
Grycan sai~ .

The wind gusted and the sky 
threatened rain, but on Saturday 
afternoon the sun eventually 
showed its face, and nothing affect-
ed the Tritons as they bullrushed 
the Waves of Pepperdine, 8-3. 

The Tritons were clicking both 
offensively and defensively and 
were able to turn up the heat seem-
ingly at will . 

For the first quarter, things 
appeared to be even, with UCSD 
and Pepperdine scoring a goal 
apiece. Then the Thton defense 
took over. 

With Glenn Bush as goalie, 
UCSD locked down its side of the 
pool in the second quarter and 
Pepperdine was stymied, scoring 
no goals. The same could not be 
said for the Thton offense, howev-
er, as it chugged along, scoring two 
goals to go into halftime with a 3-1 
read. 

Coach Denny Harper was 
extremely proud of the way his 
defense played on Saturday. 

"We threw three different 
defenses at Pepperdine and tried to 
shut down their transition game: 
Harper said. "Brett Allen had a 
huge game defensively and 
Pepperdine just looked confused 
out there: 

The Waves came out in the 
third quarter, und3unted by the 
ThtollS' tenacious front court 
defense, and began firing salvos 
from both the port and starboard 
sides. 

All their gunslinging produced 
two goals, but this did not matter as 
UCSD outscored Pepperdine 3-2 

in the third. 
At halftime, Harper told his 

team to come out aggressively in 
the third quarter. 

"A 3-1 lead is no time to sit still 
and just try and dodge bullets; We 
needed to come out and put some 
points on the board." Harper said. 

With a 6-3 lead, the Tritons 
once again left it to their defense, 
who proffered up a big fat bagel for 
Pepperdine, which it most ungra-
ciously accepted. 

Pepperdine's defense tried to 
pay back the favor, but UCSD 
refused with a polite "no thank 
you" and instead scored two goals 
to put the final score at 8-3 . 

Vladimir Ojapic was the leading 
scorer for UCSD with three goals. 
Justin Wylie played a monster game 
for the Tritons offensively and 
defensively and scored two goals. 
Jason Boettner, Jonathan Samuels, 
Eric Rosen and Brett Allen scored 
one goal each. 

This game was a huge win for 
the Tritons, making possible a fifth-
place national standing next week. 

The win was made even more 
sweet by the' fact that two Triton 
standouts, John Samuels and Matt 
Ellis, were not at their best. 

Samuels was only able to prac-
tice once this week because of ill-
ness and was not his usual self dur-
ing the game. Ellis was unable to 
play due to a hyperextended elbow. 

"The team really stepped up 
today; Harper said. "With John not 
his usual self and Matt not playing, 
everyone just played great. 
Pepperdine really wanted this game 
and had been talking like they were

Aztecs ... ? 

ROBERT FULTON 

D id you see on Saturday that the San Diego State Indigenous North 
Americans defeated the Wyoming 
Males Who Work Closely With 
Bovines 34-0? OK, maybe not, 
but the Aztecs did defeat the 
Cowboys by that margin this 
weekend. 

The big thing going on over at 
State, during this age of political 
correctness, is the controversy over 
the nickname Aztecs and whether 
or not it is insulting to those of 
Native American descent. 

I'm here to say it isn't. 
Calling SDSU the Aztecs does 

not cause any harm whatsoever. 
The reason that nickname was 
chosen was because the Aztecs 
were fearless, strong warriors with a 
lot of pride and honor. To name an 
athletic team after such a group is 
to hon-or the said group. 

This is the persona State is try-
ing to create for its athletic teams. 
It is in no way meant to be insult-
ing. 

There are athletic team names 
out there that are insulting to 
Native Americans, but SDSU's 
name is not one of them. 

For example, there are the 
Washington Redskins of the NFL. 
This name is very insulting, 
because it stems from a skin color. 
That one should be scrapped. 

Also, when sports teams such 
as the Atlanta Braves or Florida 
State Seminoles starting doing the 
Tomahawk Chop, that too is 
insulting. 

It portrays Native Americans as 
a bunch of people waving their 
arms and chanting all the time. 
That, I agree, is not right, and 
something should be done about 
the antics of the crowd that does 
these actions. 

There is also the issue of Monty 
Montezuma, SDSU's mascot. I can 
see where someone might have a 
problem with him. 

It is some guy in a costume 
jumping up and down. Tuning that 
down a notch or two would not be 
bad. 

But the Aztec name is not 
insulting. It isn't meant to be. 
People descended from the Aztecs 
should be proud of the attribution . 
It is to honor them, to remember 
them. It is to say "Hey, our athletics 
teams are strong and powerful like 
the Aztecs of old." It is not to 
insult. 

The reason this, is an issue 
now, even though the name has 
been in place for about 75 years, is 
that a bunch of students on cam-
pus who have nothing better to 
do are trying to cause trouble. It is 
a group of 20 people that is creat-
ing this mess, getting people all 
riled up just to serve their own 
whining agendas. 

Should we dispense of our 
beloved Triton? Well, it is a non-
Christian god we are honoring, so 
maybe. a Christian group on cam-
pus should rebel. And the Triton is 
carrying a trident, which insults all 
those with pitchforks. And his tail 
- can't have that, because the

Tritons Bump Record to 1S4 
Women's volleyball takes down Cal 
Poly Pomona and CSU Bakersfield 
By scon BURROUGHS 
Staff Writer 

While the rest of you were out 
getting drunk and doing drugs, or 
more likely logging numerous 
hours studying in Geisel Library 
- midterms are a mere three 
weeks away - the Triton 
women's volleyball team picked 
lip two huge California College 
Athletic Association conference 
wins. 

On Friday night it vanquished 
California State University San 
Bernardino, which is always a 
strong opponent, and followed 
that up with a convincing victory 
over rival Cal Poly Pomona. 

Both matches saw a dominat; 
ing UCSD side stomp the oppos-
ing squad, compiling wins that 
have rightfully established it as a 
Division II powerhouse. 

When the last ball dropped 
Friday night against CSU San 
Bernardino, at our very own 
RIMAC Arena, the statistics 
made it clear who dominated, 
with the Tritons winning . 3-l. 
They thoroughly dominated, 
winning the match with scores of 
15-9 in the first set and 15-5 in 
the second. Their intensity slack-
ened in the third set, resulting in 
an 8-15 loss, but UCSD 
rebounded in the fourth set to 
take it 15-13. 

The Friday night match 
against San Bernardino saw sev-
eral Triton stalwarts compile 
some outstanding statistics. AlI-
American Leslie Punelli notched 
14 kills and had 19 digs, while fel-
low Triton Kathleen Hentz picked 

up 17 kills and had a .500 hitting 
percentage for the night. Other 
significant cODtributions came 
courtesy of the always-impressive 
Laura Santerre, who had 16 kills, 
and Kearney Vis'ser, who had 17 
digs. 

Cal State San Bernardino was 
led by the standout efforts of 
Jamie Liesveld, who had a match-
high 30 kills. The team record, 
however, fell to 15-14 overall, 
with a 7-3 tally in CCAA play. 

Saturday night was more of 
the same for UCSD, except this 
time it didn't even drop a set, 
sweeping Cal Poly Pomona 3-0 in 
front of its hometown supporters. 

Those in attendance were 
treated to a virtual volleyball clin-
ic as the Tritons bumped, set and 
spiked with authority in handing 
their counterparts from Pomona 
a crushing defeat. 

The first game saw the 
Tritons take the court ready for 
action, showing little to no sign 
of fatigue from their diligent 
efforts in the game the night 
before. This enabled them to win 
the first set by a tally of 1 5-8 and 
set the tone for the remainder of 
the match. 

The Tritons capitalized on 
their momentum, picking up the 
next two sets by scores of 15-5 
and 15-8 to tally another check in 
the win column. 

This match was a real team 
effort for the blue and gold, with 
many players chipping in on the 
victory. Punelli and Wilson once 
again made significant contribu-

The UCSD women's soccer 
team found comfort at home this 
past Friday in defeating California 
State University Bakersfield 2-0. 

This was a big match up as 
both schools are in the hunt for 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association title. 

"It's good," said UCSD head 
coach Brian McManus. "It was a 
good game. Two teams with only 
two losses each. When you only 
play once a year, it's three points 
[in the standings! they've lost that 
they can't get back and it's three 
points we've won that no one can 
take away from us because of the 
extra game." 

The usual cast of characters 
came through for UCSD. Erika 
Alfredson, who is having a career 
year to date, gave the Thtdns the 
lead with a shot at the 30-minute 
mark, off a Cindy Dostalek pass. 
making the score 1-0. UCSD 
went on to dominate most of the 
first half. 

"Apart from maybe four min-

utes of the game; McManus said, 
"[ think we totally dominated. the 
game." 

The Roadrunners came out 
strong in the second half, but the 
Triton defense held its line. 
UCSD goalkeeper Kami Poma 
pitched a shutout and only had to 
make two saves. 

Dostalek was at it again in the 
second half. She was credited 
with a goal in the 81 st minute. 
Her shot was deflected by 
Bakersfield goalkeeper Stephanie 
Hall, ricocheted off Roadrunner 
Elena Ulfig and found the back of 
the net. 

Bakersfield would fail to 
threaten the rest of the way, as 
UCSD held on for the win. 

The rainy day and subsequent 
wet field did little more than dirty 
the Thton uniforms. 

"Our field - the wet field -
it's a hard field to play on with 
balls flying; McManus said. "[ 
thought we adapted to it very 
well. [ thought the kids' attitude 
was magic. How we're going after
