Mandell Weiss 
grows with $4.8 -
million expansion 
By SUSAN E. HYLEN 
Gutuditut I"t~,,, 

The University has unveiled 
plans for a $4.8 million exten-
sion of the Mandell Weiss Thea-
tre which will allow the theatre 
department more versatility in 
its productions , according to 
Dean of Arts and Humanities 
Stanley Chodorow. 

The extension is the second 
phase in the construction of the 
Mandell Weiss Performing Arts 
Center, which will be "a complex 
of theatres , each of them differ-
ent from the others," Chodorow 
said . 

Mandell Weiss, a retired 
jeweler, has given $ 1.2 million to 
the Uni versity and the profes-
sional La Jolla Playhouse, which 
both produce plays in the exist-
ing Weiss theatre, for construc-
tion of the extension. Weiss, now 
92, contributed $ 1.14 million 
toward the existing theatre. The 
University will provide the 
remaining $3.6 million needed to 
pay for the extension. 

The new thrust stages will be a 
state-of-the-art version of the 
Warren Theatre in which the 
audience is seated in a semi-
circle around the stage. The 
Warren Theatre is technolo-
gically obsolete and "stands in 
the way of future development," 
according to Chodorow. and will 
eventually be replaced . The 
Warren and Weiss theatres are 
presently the only theatres on 
campus. Chodorow said it was 
necessary to first build a new 
theatre before removing the old 
theatre. 

The principal value of the 
Weiss Forum thrust theatre will 

be modernizat ion of present 
facilities , according to theatre 
p r ofes" o r Arthur Wag ner. 
Besides providing about 150 
more seats than Warren, there 
will also be more room back-
stage at the new theatre. 

The large size of the Forum 
theatre is a reflection of UCSD's 
partnership with the Playhouse 
for , as Chodorow acknowledges , 
"the [theatre] department needs 
a theatre , but it doesn't need a 
big one ." Chodorow said the 
project aims at serving both the: 
Un iversity and the La J o: ..t 
Playhouse. 

Currently. the Playhouse on ... 
presents plays during the um-
mer. but the new faci lity wou lJ 
allow year-round productio'1 
Wagner aid that the Foru m 
theatre will "solidify our relatio n-
ship with the La Jolla Play' 
house," which intends to raise 
funds for a projected third thea-
tre. 

This stage, a studio - or liter-
ally a "black box" - theatre, will 
benefit both parties because It 
will give them -the freedom to 
create plays without the theat re 
to worry about," Chodorow sa id. 
He explained that because the 
large black room "doesn't impose 
anything" on the art ists , they can 
create their own shapes and 
colors , and choose the size and 
location of the stage. 

Wagner said this allows "the 
possibility of so much more val-
iety in staging, and allo ws for 
more experimental things .t 
well." 

All three types of stage an: 
desirable for a strong theatre 
program, according to Cho-

Student asks for Third College 
election results to be voided 
By LETICIA VILLARREAL 
Stl4l1 W,It~, 

"Inefficient" and " unpro-
fessional" were the words Carl 
Katz used to describe the Third 
College student electoral process 
when he asked the Third College 
Judicial Board to have last week's 
Third College election results 
"nullified and void." 

Katz, a Third student who ran 
for the position of student-at-
large and lost , presented his case 
before the JUdical Board in an 
open hearing Wednesday n:ght. 
Hi. argument for scrapping the 
election results and holding new 
elections for Third College elect-
ed positions revolved around the 
"personal essays" that applicants 
were asked to write in the Third 
College Student Council appli-
cation forms. 

Katz did not fill in that por-
tion of the application form 
because, he said. be did not know 
at tbe time that quotes from tbe 

essays would be printed on the 
ballots, under their respective 
authors' names. He pointed out 
that no indication was given on 
the application forms as to why 
the Third College Student 
Council Subcommittee for Elec-
tions (the group responsible for 
managing the elections) was 
requesting essays from the can-
didates. 

Katz equated the printing of 
the essay excerpts on the ballots 
by the subcommittee to cam-
paigning for or endorsing candi-
dates . He said the quotes were 
taken out of context and a sub-
jective decision was made by the 
subcommittee as to what to print 
and what to leave out. 

Katz feels that the absence on 
the ballot of a quote under his 
name may have cost him his bid 
for the student-at-Iarge position. 
Students who did not know any-
thing about him when they came 
to the polls to vote almost cer-
tainly aot a neaative imprelSion 

of him, he explained. The blank 
under his name may have led 
them to believe that he did not 
care enough about getting elected 
to bother writing about it.

Volunteers sought for two 
asthmatic research studies 

Moderately asthmatic patients are sought for two 
clinical research studies in progress at the UCSD 
Medical Center.' 

The Wallace study involves use of an 
antihistamine tablet with anti-asthma properties. 
This new medication may be tolerated by patients 
who cannot take other antihistamines or for whom 
these medications have not been effective. 

To be eligible, patients must be between the ages 
of 18 and 70 and take daily asthma medication. The 
six-month study requires twice-monthly visits to the 
UCSD Medical Center. 

Supporters of Rev. Jesse Jackson for President in 
the 41st Congressional District will hold a delegate 
selection caucus on Sunday, May I at the University 
of San Diego University Center Forum A-B to elect 
their candidates for delegates to the Democratic 
National Convention in Atlanta. 

The Phison study invovles use of an inhaled 
medication to prevent asthma attacks. Eligible 
patients must be on daily medication for their 
asthma symptoms and use the study medication as 
an adjunct therapy for their standard medication . 

Participants for this study must be between the 
ages of 18 and 70 and make weekly visits to the 
UCSD Medical Center during the 16-week duration 
of the study. 

The 41st Congressional District includes nearly all 
of the northern half of the city of San Diego, from 
Point Loma and San Diego State to Ra·ncho 
Bernardo and Solana Beach. Any registered 
Democrat residing in the 41st Congressional District 
who signs a pledge card at the caucus to support 
Jesse Jackson may participate in the caucus. 

For information on either study call the UCSD 
Medical Center's Healthline at .543-5820 between 8 
am and.5 pm.

This discrepancy can be ex-
plained by differing estimates of 
how large the on-campus hospi-

to May Roush, a UCSD senior

'Civil Service' 
or Disservice? 

The campaign over the recently defeated football 
referendum revealed a weakness in the A.S . election 
codes we think should be corrected. 

Athletic Director Judy Sweet and her coaches sat 
down and organized a voter campaign. They asked 
each athlete to return four or five voter receipt stubs 
to the athletic department. Though they got 
responses from ten coaches returning about 600 
ballots to Sweet, the department cancelled the effort 
after suggestions that the athletes felt pressured to 
participate. 

Our objections are two-fold . First, while Sweet 
insists that the receipt effort was turn-out oriented, 
pressure to support the referendum was clear. 
Coaches urged support for the referendum in team 
meetings; 1M officials did so as well. It's not right 
that people who are dependent on one another -
the athletes on coaches, the coaches on Sweet -
should be asked to provide proof of their in-
volvement in a political campaign. Such pressure is 
unavoidable; it's naive to say athletes didn't feel 
responsibillty to their peers, or to a coach who may 
decide whether they start next week, or that coaches 
didn't feel pressure to be responsive to someone who 
influences their budgets . 

~cond, we don't think paid administrators ofthe 
university s~ould be involved in influencing a 
student electIOn. Sweet has the right and obligation 
to ~y wh~t. she wants to about any campus issue, 
but organlZJng an effort on our time, since we pay 
her salary, is not right. She's a civil servant for the 
purposes of the A.S . election, and civil servants 
~egaHy and properly can't engage in election activity 
JQ stale, local and national elections. 

Now is the time , while the election is fresh in 
people's minds and before anyone can begin 
maneuvering for the next election , to amend the 
codes to prohibit the involvement of campus 
administrators in any sort of organized election 
efforts . It's a student election to determine the 
disposition of student fees , and it should stay that 
way. Administrators already have enough money 
and influence with which io play. 

Enter at Your 
Own Risk 

Just in time for UCSD's Open House, con-
struction workers have once again materialized 
alongside the G ilman entrance to the University . 
Over six months have passed since ground was 
broken . Will another six pass before we see its 
completion? 

An entrance gate is sorely needed at UCSD. Not a 
weekend goes by without three or four cars 
wandering around the Revelle Provost 's and Guar-
dian offices looking for Mandeville Auditorium, 
Central Library. or the Bookstore. Currently, 
visitors must know the campus better than many 
students just to finti a campus map. 

An information booth at the Gilman entrance to 
the campus would alleviate many of the questions 
visitors have by providing temporary parking 
passes, maps , access to metered parking, etc . 

It 's a shame the entrance wasn't finished in time 
for Open House; let's hope it 's completed for 
commencement exercises in June . As it slands , it's 
an eyesore that leaves first-time visi tors with a 
negative impression of the campus ,

Editor: 
Thanks to ... 
• The voters for enduring flyers , 

debates and rain . I'm very much 
impressed by your responsiveness, 
especially those "unknown indivi-
duals" who took it upon themselves 
to network my campaign . 
• The other candidates who con-

tributed greatly to this election. It 
takes a tremendous amount of time 
and concern to run for office and I'm 
certain your dedication and con-
tinued involvement in the A.S. 
government will strengthen our 
success. Anthony, Eric, Johnny and 
Wilhemina ("write-in'), I sincerely 
request your support and assistance 
throughout the year. 
• The administrators of all areas 

for this election. The elections com-
mittee, A.S . secretaries, College 
Deans, the Guardian editors, Warren 
R .A . 's, Chet Anderson, those 
English EAP students and many, 
many others all deserve a special 
thanks for their invaluable con-
tributions to this election season. 

I would also like to thank this 
year's A.S. officers for a fine job and 
extend to them our appreciation for 
their efforts. Dave Marchick has 
offered to assist in the transition, for 
which I am extremely grateful. 

We have an excellent group of 
people ; I antici pate a dynamic and 
progressive year. On behalf of the 
'88 / '89 officers I'd like to say thanks 

and assure everyone that we will be 
serving you. 

Maynard Dimmesdale 
A.S. President-elect 

Dukakis Fan 
Is Angry 
Editor: 

Many UCSD students are regis-
tered to vote in the presidential 
elections . The Guardian has an 
obligation to fairly present all the 
candidates to the students . It has not 
done this . This problem must be 
corrected for the benefit of the 
student body. 

The presidential election is a prime 
time for the American people to set 
mandates for the next four years. By 
c.r~ating active discussions and po-
litical awareness, the presidential 
election assures Americans a presi-
dency that is sensitive to the people . 

Of course the media has to ~sist 
this process. T.V., newspapers, and 
the media can create an aura of free 
expression and intellectual broad-
minded ness. This energy from the 
press should invigorate the process 
of democracy. 

Unfortunately, the Guardian has 
done a poor job at living up to these 
ideals. On the contrary, they have 
stifled the process. For instance, the 
Guardian has endorsed Jesse Jack-
son's campaign and given it a full 
voice in their Opinion columns. This 
was done at the expense of the other 
candidates. The Guardian has done 
an injustice to UCSD students, and 
American democracy as a whole, by 
not presenting the wealth of infor-

mation about the other candidates . 
This is not right. 

To be specific, I have never seen 
an article or opinion in the Guardian 
advocating Michael Dukakis - the 
Democratic front-runner . Even 
though TI ME, Newsweek , U. S. 
News and World Report, and even 
Omni magazine, have all published 
numerous articles analyzing and 
praising the Dukakis campaign . 
Even though Michael Dukakis is a 
graduate of Harvard Law School 
and was once on the facult y of the 
JFK school of Government at Har-
vard. Even though, Michael Dukakis 
has created many excellent social 
programs (i .e. training welfare 
mothers for up-scale jobs, cleaning

What Do Reg 
Fees Go For? 

Editor: 
The Guardian in its Q & A section 

[Feb 22] asked this question: "What 
do you think your registration fees 
pay for?" Five students responded . 
but none gave a correct answer. The 
most common answers were. "1 never 
thought about it," "for the ad-
ministration ," and for "classes, pro-
fessors , and faculty ." 

We, the six student members of 
the Registration Fee Advisory Com-
mittee to the Vice Chancellor of 
Undergraduate Affairs , are con-
cerned with this lack of knowledge 
of where millions of student dollars 
are going annually. Don't get us 
wrong. This is not a criticism; before 
we were appointed to this committee

An Athlete Gives Thanks That Fo.otball Lost 
Editor: , 

Thank God! The football referendum didn't pass! 
This referendum was an invidious porkbarrel. I am 
on the fencing team, and I was incensed by the 
attempt to coerce athletes to vote for it . The 
"reasoning" was this: if all current intercollegiate 
athletes voted to pay 510/ qrt . to support a football 
team, all other IC sports could split the remaining 
SS/qn. 

As much respect and gratitude as I have for Judy 
Sweet, I was offended at her comment that only 
those who voted for the referendum were in support 
of UCSD athletics. I think there is I 00% support for 
athletics at UCSO, and this is evidenced by ICs, 
I Ms, and high student enrollment in P.E. classes. 

I came to UCSD specifically because there is not a 
football team. It is not football as a sport I dislike, 
but ratherthe enigma it creates. Since the time of the 
Greeks, intellectual development and athletic 
prowess have been held as the hi~hes t of aspirations. 
After all we have achieved at UCSD, it would be 

tremendously disappointing if UCSD became ano-
ther "Rah!Rah!" school. 

Besides, all of this would be at the expense of 
exisiting programs. I know the intentions are good, 
but soon thmgs would change. Certain IMs would 

. be cancelled because an expensive new field was 
going in. Ot~er. ICs would lose locker privilege, and 
the already limIted newspaper coverage . All of this 
for an e~pensive dinosaur that would only prove 
worthwhIle as a winning Division I football team. I 
personally hope the ~tudent body prefers character. 
For those that arc dead set, SDSU i. riah. down the 
road. 

As for the $S for IC athletics, I propose we put it 
On the next ballot . I don'lthink the outstanding IC 
teams that already exist should have to grovel for 
every underfunded penny they get , and I am con-
fident the rest of the student body feels the same. 
Give the students a cha~ce to show their support for 
athletics . After the votes come in, then let Judy 
Sweet decide what UCSD thinks about athletics.

OPINION 

Do you feel the U.S. actions in the Persian Gulf were appropriate? 

No, I don't believe it was 
juslified. I guess if we are fighting 
in a war we are justified, but since 
war has nOI been declared it is nOI 
juslifiable. We are supposed 10 be 
in Ihe Persian Gulf jor a peace-
keeping mission. I'd like 10 see 
marl' diplomatic negotiations to 
solve the conflicl, rather Ihan 
using mililary actions.

History 

Continued from pale 4 
none of us knew what reg fees 
paid for, either. However, it is 
time this lack of knowledge was 
dispelled. 

To begin, each student at 
UCSD pays quarterly 5187 in 
"reg fees." This payment is only 
one part of a student's total 
quarterly mandatory fees of S518. 

Yes, they had a right to relaliate. 
Iran cannot be allowed 10 mine 
international walerways and in-
terfere wilh shipping of the coun-
tries not involved wilh the war 
wilh Iraq . Iran must learn to 
respecl international laws and 
not resort to terrorism 10 achieve 
Iheir goals and desires .

History 

Last year reg fee revenues totalled 
S7 .8 million. These revenues pay 
only for non-instructional, dis-
cretionary student services. 

At UCSD, these student servi-
ces are provided by more than 
two dozen "units" - e.g., the 
Health Center, Legal Services, 
Intercollegiate Athletics, Uni-
versity Events, Special Services,

is not gelting to the rool of the

Elections 
Continued from pale I 

Julia Rodriguez, A.S. Elec-
tions Committee student-at-
large, appeared before the Ju-
dical Board as a witness for 
Katz's case. She confirmed Katz's 
allegation that Third College ~an 
out of ballots on the first voting 
day between 12:30 pm and 3 pm. 
She added that "lots of students 
asked for ballots and couldn't 
get any" during that time, which 
prevented many students from 
voting until about half past three , 
when more ballots arrived at the 
Third College polls. 

Katz read a written statement 
to the Judicial Board from Bob 
Kim another former candidate 
for ~udent .. t-large. In it Kim 
states that had he known thatan 
exerpt from his essay where he 
calls himself a perfectionist would 
be printed on the ballot, he is not 
sure If he would have consented 
to write a personal essay. 

Kim feels that this statement 
was taken out of context and 
may have rubbed some voters 
the wrong way. Katz used Kim's 
statement to prove that the 
cxerpts were chosen and printed 
without the author's knowledge 
or consent, and called this reason 
enough for nullifying the ele~tion 
results and holding new elechons. 

Karen Fagan. chairperson of 
the Third College Subcommittee 
for Elections, testified before the 
board in defense of the electoral 
procedures followed by the sub-
committee. Fagan claimed that 
most of the Third College candi-
dates she talked to were sur-
prised to see excerpts of their 
essays printed on the ballots. 
The candidates were glad to see 
them there because they agreed 
with Fagan that this gave them 
an opportunity to tell the voters 
something about themselves -
possibly gaining some votes. 

The reason there was a shor-
tage of ballots at the polls for 
over two hours on the first of two 
voting days , Fagan explained, 
was because the voter turnout 
for Third College this year was 
much greater than anticipated . 

Fagan also criticized Katz for 
turning in an application that 
was "written in a hurry" with a 
"barely distinguishable"address, 
and she pointed out that 10 o~t 
of II candidates filled out their 
forms completely. 

Erik Basil. Third Co llege Ju-
dicial Board chairperson, ca lled 
the heari ng to a close and se t 
Monday as the date on which the 
board will co me back with a

Conservationist Jack Hood Vaughn 

Fighting to save the environment 
By ADAM LEVY 
s • .,g Wrltn 

There is a crisis going on in the 
world at this very moment which 
has received far less media auen-
tion than the news on the Middle 
East , Nicaragua or income taxes . 
This crisis is the gradual destruc-
tion of the environment. 

Jack Hood Vaughn, vice pres-
ident of Conservation Interna-
tional, gave a lecture last Thurs-
day on this topic. He spoke with 
urgency and his message was 
clear: the environment is the 
world 's most precious resource, 
and if humans don't change their 

Vaughn also claimed that the 
events going on in subsaharan 
Africa are "absolutely catastro-
phic and most [people in these 
countries] cannot comprehend 
what is happening. The lack of 
awareness and knowledge is 
further complicated by bank-
ruptcy ," Vaughn added . 

he said, is also responsible for 
committi ng many environment-
ally unsound practices which 
include the overuse of pesticides, 
topsoil erosion, water pollution 
and destruction of wildlife ha bi -
tat. 

Despite Vaughn's troubled 
account , he has not lost hope , 
There is a growing movement, he 
said , of private organizations 
which consist of specialists from 
all fields trying to raise the 
awareness level of environmen-
tal concerns. In America alone 
there are 600 environmentally 
active groups and it is becoming 
a major international trend . 

In addition, Vaughn's organi-
zation , Conservation I nterna-

See VAUGHN, page 10 

A 
As vice president of Conservat ion International Jack Hood Vaug hn 
has worked in several Latin American countr ies The environment is 

the world 's most pre-
cious resource, and 
if humans don ' t 
change tileir destruc-
tive course, catas-
trophe looms not too 
far away. 

Vaughn cited three factors 
causing environmental destruc-
tion. First, the explosive popula-
tion growth which has increased 
at a rate of three percent each 
year and which in a century will 
increase the African population 
twenty fold adds to the problem. 
Second , there is widespread soil 
erosion caused by unsound agri-
cult ural practices ; and third, 
there is a fundamental lack of 
education and relatively low 
priority given to reversing these 
trends. 

Regarding Latin America , 
Vaughn 's account was no less 
sobering. The tropical rain for-
ests, which arealso in Africa and 
a few other parts of the world 
and cover only six percent of the 
land's surface, are being rapidly 
destroyed . They are home to 50 
percent of the world's plants, 
animals and insects. 

Liberal Arts seniors make 
plans for the future 

-Jack Hood Vaughn 

destructive course, catastrophe 
looms not far away. 

Vaughn's first point was a 
familiar one aimed at today's 
political elite. "Why aren't our 
political contenders dealing with 
our basic survival issues?" he 
uked. He criticized Washington 
for concentrating too much ,on 
countries like Nicaragua and 
South Africa, while losing sight 
of the big picture. 

"When was the last time you 
heard anything about the rest of 
Africa?" he asked. "And why is 
our sight so fixed on Central 
America that we have lost sight 
of the rest of Latin America?" 

Many politicians, for the most 
part, ignore the grave ecological 
practices going on in both Latin 
America and Africa, whereby 
the soil is being depleted at a 
rapid pace and the rain forests 
are being destroyed, Vaughn 
said . 

- More than 50 million acres of 
land are permanently destroyed 
or rendered marginal" and 50 
acres are lost every 30 seconds. 
At the , present rate of destruc-
tion, in 50 years it will all be de-
stroyed , Vaughn said . 

This destruction is caused in 
part by slash-and-burn farming 
in which natives burn entire areas 
of rain forest and use it for 
farming. Then after a few years 
when the soil is depleted, they 
move on to another piece of the 
forest . According to Vaughn, it 
is the dead debris from trees and 
plants, like leaves and branches, 
that give the soil nutrients for 
new plant life to grow. Because 
the soil of the Amazon is itself 
very poor, once the trees and

Liberal arts majors have tradi-
tionally encountered more prob-
lems breaking into the job market 
than those who graduate in the 
"quantitative" J!lajors such as 
engineering, sCtences, and eco-
nomics, according to Neil Mur-
ray, director ofthe Career Servi-
ces Center at UCSD.

Services Director

The reason for this pheno-
menon said Skip Sturman, direc-
tor of career services at Dart-
mouth College, lies in corpora-
tions' desire to hire those gradu-
ates who are technically qualified 
and able to contribute immedi-
ately t.o short term profits . Cor-
porations often lack the fore-
sight to hire liberal arts majors, 
who tend to contribute to corpora-
tions' successes in the long run, 
he added. 

Fortunately for liberal arts 
seniors, the Career Services Cen-
ter recently started an innovative 
new program called SLATE -
Senior Liberal Arts Training for 
Employment. SLATE "was born 
out of an on-going frustration 
that liberal arts students fre-
quently encounter: the problem 
of graduating without knowing 
what it is they will do and finding 
the job market tough to tackle," 
Murray said . 

It is common for many stu-
dents to remain undecided about 
career choices until well into 
their senior year. SLATE was 

created as a final stop-gap mea-
sure to ensure that "lost" liberal 
arts majors leave UCSD with an 
idea of the direction in which 
they are headed . 

SLA TE has few requirements. 
In fact , the program asks onl y 
that its participants have senior 
status and are unsure as to what 
they want to do . Then, over a 
period of three weeks, the partic-
ipants meet with counselors dur-
ing five one-hour sessions . Each 
session concentrates on different 
aspects of both the job market 
and career hunting. The partici-
pants first take assessment tests 
to help indicate their interests . 
Later, they critique resumes and 
study interviewing techniques. By 
the end ofthe five sessions , more 
than 60 percent of the partici-
pants have identified solid career 
goals, according to results ob-
tained from last quarter's pro-
gram . 

SLATE also offers a workshop 
on how to make personal con-
tacts,

SLATE 
Continued from page 8 

Now that seniors are aware 
that a program exists. the diffi-
culty for the senior lies in trying 
to enroll in the program, All 50 
spaces of this quarter's first 
SLATE program filled in two 
days . As a result of this tre-
mendous response, the Career 
Ser ices Center has added two 
more SLATE programs for this 
quarter (starting on Apri130 and 
May 14). SLATE's popularity 
may also stem from its low cost 
- only SlOper student. 

So far, the program can be 
considered a success . according 
to both Career Service Center 
specialists and student partici-
pants. Patricia Bringham. Muir 
communications senior. re-
marked that the program "did 
everything it said it would . It 
helped get my goals into focus 
and get me on the right track." 
Donald R, Tomlin Jr., a Revelle 
psychology senior, added that 
SLA TE also made him realize 
that "you can't expect a job to 
materialize without actively 
searching." 

Happy with SLATE's success 
in helping students, Murray has 
one piece of important advice for 
liberal arts majors: "Determine a 
career goal and [get] experience 

before graduating ... liberal art 
majors can fare every bit as well 
as quantitative majors ." 

Vaughn 
Continued from page 8 
tional , is working on the local 
level in Bolivia, Peru and Mex-
ico . This organization "brings 
help and skills and innovative 
ideas in Latin American go -
vernments and conservation 
groups at all levels." Vaughn 
said . It helped Bolivia set aside 
four million acres on which there 
are on-going tests to find a com-
promise between development 
and conservation: "sustainable 
agricult ure and development." 

"There are things that can be 
done." Vaughn said. Instead of 
slash and burn farming, the 
materials can be used for graz-
ing. Watersheds can be pro-
tected , gUllying can be avoided . 
and more trees can be planted as 
others are being cut down. If the 
environment must be exploited. 
there are ways to "exploit it in 
rational ways," Vaughn said . 

Vaughn is a former ambassa-
dor to Panama and Columbia, 
and a former director the Peace 
Corps , His speech , titled 
"Growth and Conservation : A 
Collision Course," was in honor 
of the 10th annual David Marc 
Belkin Memorial Lecture.

Men's volleyball 
takes second 

SCVBC • In 
By RICHARD CRAIG 
Stf(jf Writer 

The UCSD Triton men's vol-
leyball team fi nished its season 
over the weekend by placing 
second in the Southern Califor-
nia Volleyball Conference Tour-
nament , held here at UCSD. 

The Triton men finished se-
cond to the Anteaters of UC 
Irvine, who defeated them in the 
championship game Saturday 
night, I I-IS, 8-15 , 5-15, a bit-
tersweet end to a year of mixed 
blessings. 

Head Coach Oscar "Digger" 
Graybill , while naturally subdued 
after the los~, was nonetheless 
"proud we got as far as we did ." 

The Tritons simply ran into a 
bUll saw in the championsh ip 
game as Irvine, led by conference 
most valuable player Brian Kehe , 
avenged the defeat administered 
them the last time the two teams 
met. 

" We didn't play badly," said 
senior hitter Paul M iller, "but 
Irvine played as well as we've 
seen them." Miller, an all-con-
ference pick and the only UCSD 

player graduat ing, led the Tri-
tons with 15 kills. 

"T he st rength o f this team has 
been a consistent offense, "Coach 
Gray b ill reflected , " but they 
plugged up the middle on us and 
took a way our firepower." 

Team Captam Jeff Babcock, 
wh o had 13 kills , agreed that , 
while the effort was there, "Irvine 
just played really wel l." 

fhe UCSD squad reached the 
championship round by defeat-
ing Chapman ' College Friday 
night , 9-15, 15-9, 15-9, 16- 14. 
Coming off a lack.luster first 
game, the Tritons rallied to sweep 
the next three games, keyed by a 
spectacular 28-kill performance 
by sophomore hitter John Lim. 

Pla yi ng without the services of 
aili ng a ll-conference hitter Nick 
Rothman , UCSD came out "a 
li tt le tentative ," according to 
Graybill , and faced an uphill 
bat tle against the Panthers' 
monolith ic start ing line (i nclud-
ing one player at 6'4N and three at 
6'5'1 after losing the first game. 

Led by Li m , however. the 
smaller Tritons " out-q u icked

Spiked out - UCSD couldn 't keep up with the Anteater hitters as UCI took the SCVSC tournament 
in three st raight games Saturday. 

Baseball takes two from Biola 
By PHIL GRUEN 
S~WrlteT 

By sweeping Biola University in a double-
header Saturday aftcraoon, the UCSD men's 
baseball team boosted its chances for regional 
playoff action that begins in a c,ouple of weeks. 

Triton outfjelder Eric Judson went two for 
four with a home run in the fifth inning to lead 
UCSD to a 7-1 victory in the nightcap, with 
sta?dout pitcher Rick 'Nowak picking up his 

seventh win. In the opener, the Trito'os benefit-
ted from a couple of Biola miscues to squeak 
out a 3-1 victory. Senior Dave Adamson im-
proved his record to 3- I wi~h victory during a 
game in which UCSD only managed two hits . 

UCSD improved its overall record to 22-12 
with the non-conference victories . while Biola 
fell to 19-22. The Tritons will host CSU San 
Bernardino in an important contCil on Thurs-
day at 2:30, and will then face Southern Cal 
Collcae on Saturdayat 1:00 for their final home 
contest of the season.

them in the middle," according 
to Graybill, in storming back to 
take the last t"ree games . 

In the final game, a back-and-
forth , dramatic contest , Lim was 
"phenomenal ," in Coach Gray-
bill's words, in help ing the Tri-
tons win a game that C hapman 
had been one point from takin~. 

Understandably, no one on 
the squad was elated with finish-
ing second in the tournament; 
but for a team that finished the 
season with a record of 11-19, 
there was a great deal of opti . 
mism among the players after 
the final game. After a season in 
which 10 players were out a week 
or more due to injury, the team 
looked to next year knowing 
that the entire roster - with the 
exception of Miller - will return. 

"It was a posit ive year," Bab-

cock said , " but wit h a ll the peo-
ple we've got coming back, I'm 
really looking forward to next 
year." 

Coach Graybill echoed the sen-
timent saying, "Nex t year we" 
be stronger. " Even Miller, having 
played his final game for the 
Tritons , said that although "it's 
been lots of fun ... I wish was 
coming back next year. " 

So perhaps 1989 will be the 
year that UCSD men's volleyball 
reaches parity with the much-
ballyhooed women's program. If 
not , it won't be for a lack of 
trying.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

From: The Registration Fee Advisory Committee to the Vice Chancellor 

On Monday February 22, 1988 the Guardian in its Q & A section asked this 
question : "What do you think your registration fees pay for?" Five students 
responded , "or however," none gave a correct answer, the most common 
answers being WI never thought about it ," "for the administration," and fo r 
"classes, professors, and faculty ." We , the six student members of the 
Registration Fee Advisory Committee to the Vice Chancellor of Undergraduate 
Affairs , are concerned with this lack of knowledge of where millions of student 
dollars are going annually. Don't get us wrong, this is not a criticism; before we 
were appointed to this committee none of us knew what Reg Fees paid for either . 
However, it is time this lack of knowledge was dispelled . 

To begin, each stude nt at UCSD pays quarterly $ 187 in " Reg Fees." This 
payment is only one part of a student's total quarterly mandatory fees of $518. 
Last year Reg Fee revenues totalled $7.8 million. These revenues go to pay for 
non·instructional, discretionary student services . At UCSD, these student 
services are provided by more than two dozen "units"· e.g., the Health Center, 
Legal Services, Intercollegiate Athletics, University Events. Special Services, 
Student Affirmative Action Committee, Disabled Student Services outreach, 
Safety Awareness Program, Career Services, University Center, Crafts Center, 
International Center, Student Affairs in the Office of Graduate Studies and 
Research, Psychological Counseling Services, Campus Recreation, part of 
college Residence Halls staff support, all College Deans support services, Off-
Campus Housing, and the Student Activities offices staff and support. Again, 
these units are exogenous to the instruction and research functions of the 
University. In essence, student Registration Fees pay only for discretionary 
student support services that are not funded by the State of California . 

Futhermore, students also pay a quarterly educational fee of 5268. This is used 
for nondiscretionary student support services at UCSD, e.g., Admissions and 
Registrar, Student Financial Services, and Student Outreach and Recruitment. 

Lastly, students at UCSD are also responsible for other mandatory fees as 
part of their total quarterly fees . However, these additional fees must be 
approved by the student popUlation in referenda . Currently, UCSD students 
pay three such fees : I) a Campus Activity Fee ofS 13.50,2) a Student Center Fee 
of $37.50, and 3) a Student Recreational Fee of 512. 

In sum, the following is a breakdown of mandatory quarterly fees : 
Registration fees: 187.00 
Educational fees : 268.00 
Campus Activity fee : 13.50 
Student Center fee : 37.50 
Student Rec. fee : 12.00 
TOTAL QUARTERLY FEE: 518.00 

A health insurance fee of $84.50 is optional for most students . 
We, as students, and as members of the Registration Fee Advisory Committee, 

belive that it is important that the student body ta UCSD be aware of where their 
millions of yearly Registration Fees are used . We hope that this letter has 
enlightened our peers, and we welcome further comment or questions.
