Holocaust Chair 
Created at UCSC 
SANTA CRUZ- Anne 
Neufeld Levin, World War II 
survivor and founder of the 
annual Neufeld-Levin 
Holocaust Lecture Series, has 
donated $250,000 to UCSC to 
establish an endowed chair in 
Holocaust studies. Levin 
stipulated that the chair should 
have both an interdisciplinary 
focus and a public-outreach 
element, adding that "the chair 
is only a nucleus around which 
other activities will be 
possible." Levin has also 
given the university her family 
archive of Holocaust-related 
materials, including docu-
ments, medals, stamps, 
artifacts, photos and letters.

At Affirmative

CONTROVERSY: Regents fear a 
possible riot at UCSF meeting, 
adjourn affirmative-action hearing 
By Dove AIex __

SAN FRANCISCO - Reflecting the growing tension 
surrounding the issue of affirmative action, the UC Board 
of Regents abruptly walked out during a hearing on the 

· university's race-based admissions policics Thursday, 
· fearing a potential riot by nearly 100 students who at-
tended the UC San Francisco-Laurel Heights meeting. 

The students, many of whom traveled across the state 
for the hearing, participated in a pro-affirmative-action 
rally attended by over 200 people outside the Laurel 
Heights facility. Calling on the regents to preserve the 
UC's affirmative-action programs, the protesters crowded 
into the meeting hall during the admissions hearings. 

Chairman of the Board Howard Leach adjourned the 
meeting when audience members stood up and began 
chanting after UCSD student Martha Vega was not al-
lowed to speak at the conclusion of the public comment 
period.

While some students spent Fri-

Porter's Pub, BuU's Eye Tavern and 
nearby apartments before attending 
the concert. 

"We were packed," said BuU's

at LoUapaIooza Jut year, concluded 

the concert. 
A.S. President Naomi Falk said 

she was pleased with the turn-out at 
the Warren Mall location. The event 
was moved from its ~ditiona1 Price

more laid back atmosphere. 

"Money aside, I think we should 
[keep the concert at the Warren 
Mall]," said Falk. "But money is a 
big consideration." 

The move out of the Price Center 
added $9,000 to the Sun God's price 
tag. 

While Louison said that he "per-
sonally enjoyed [the Warren Mall] 
much more than the Price Center," 
he added that "you lose some of the 
conveniences of the Price Center," 
such as rile food court and Bull's 
Ey". 

Whether Sun God returns to the 
Price Center will be up to next year's 
Sun God Committee, he added. 

The extension of this year's fes-
tival to include Saturday's Psyche-
delic Unified Funk Festival (PUFF) 
- an all-day fair and concert at the 
Warren Mall- drew 900 people, 
according to organizers. 

"Things went really well," said 
PUFF organizer Charissa Lee. "Our 
budget was a lot lower than Sun 
God '5, but the quality of the music 
was about the same. " 

Police were out in force for the 
weekend's festivities, as approxi-
mately 15 students were arrested or 
taken to detox for alcohol-related 
offenses. 

Seven police offlCCrs were on 
duty at the concert, as well as 14 
campus-protection assistants and 29 
staff pro employees. 

Some students said they felt that 
police were too hasty in sending 
inebriated people to detox. 

"There were about 10 other stu-
dents in detox when I got there," 
said a Revelle senior who asked to 
remain anonymous. "It's necessary 
to have a lot of police there for our 
own protection, but I definitely 
didn't need to be taken in."

A.S. Debates Abandoning UCSA 
By Terry Lew 
Staff Writer 

A.S, President Naomi Falk's pro-
posed 1995-96 Executive Budget 
was the subject of conflict at 
yesterday'seight-hour A.S, Finance 
Committee meeting. The majority 
of her budget passed with little chal-
lenge, but s~v~ral items, including a 
potential cut of UCSD funding for 
the University of California Student 
Association (UCSA), led to heated 
debate, 

The UCSA, a systemwide lobby-
ing organization funded almost en-
tirely by UC campus contributions, 
projects a $4,952 deficit this year. 
According to Falk, if ue Davis' 
proposal to rejoin th,e organization 
next year succeeds, ueSA will break 
even. However, if Davis is unsuc-
cessful, and UCSD withdraws, 
UCSA will face a deficit ofS40,327. 

"I'm most disturbed by the ac-
tion of taking the UCSA contribu-
tion out of the Executive Budget," 
said Falk. "I don't think you can 
really place a value on the kind of 
representation we get within the 
system from UCSA. 

"As a student, it's important to 
have an organization like UCSA to 
make sure my fees don't increase 
and financial aid and affirmative 
action are preserved," added Falk. 

Proponents of the cut say it is a 
necessary sacrifice in order to real-

locate money to oiher student orga-
nizations. 

"I see all the student organiza-
tions getting screwed, and we're 
sending $20,000 a year to UCSA," 
said Vice President of Finance 
Edmondo Robinson. 

"I think that we were trying to be 
equitable in every way we could," 
said Marshall Senior Senator Rich-
ard Freye. "There are so many things 
we would like to fund, but we can't 
fund everything." 

One of the contested realloca-
tions is $6,000 for athletic tailgate 
events. Introduced by Greg Hearn, 
Intra-Fraternity Council (IFC) rep-
resentative to the A.S., the money 
would fund concerts at intercolle-
giate sports and I FC/panhellenic 
events in an allemptto increase at-
tendance. 

"What we're hoping to do is get 
students out in advance, maybe have 
a concert, or a barbecue, or what-
ever," said Hearn. "We're just try-
ing to get people out and get some 
life into the campus." 

The proposed budget will be 
brought before the full AS. Council 
at its Wednesday meeting. 

According to Robinson, "The 
senators have the vote. They repre-
sent what the students desire, and if 
that's what they think should hap-
pen, that's what's going to hap-
pen." 

The UCSD Guardian 

HEARING: 
ContInued from ..... 1 
auditorium and ordered everyone to 
leave immediately. Acting in pro-
test, most of the students disregarded 
the police demands. 

"All we want is acknowledgment 
[from the board)," said UC Santa 
Cruz student Hymi Jacob Ross. "We 
are fighting the status quo ... we are 
trying to change things." 

While no one was arrested, UC 
Santa Barbara student Betty Chan 
was dragged out of the room when 
she attempted to approach Student 
Regent-designate Edward Gomez, 
who chose to remain after the meet-
ing had adjourned. 

ue Provost Walter Massey, who 
also stayed behind, unsuccessfully 
tried to intervene on the woman's 
behalf. 

According to UC police, the stu-
dent was warned three times that 
she would be arrested if she chose to 
stay. The woman was cited and re-
leased the same afternoon. 

In an attempt to quell escalating 
emotions, UCLA Chancellor 
Charles Young spoke with the stu-
dents, urging them to leave the build-
ing with the assurance they would 
be allowed to return when the board 
reassembled. 

Young, who came under fire re-
cently for his sharp criticisms of 
affirmative-action opponent Regent 
Ward Connerly, said he shared the

4 OPINION The UCSD Guardian 

PINION 
Should adolescents be tried by an 
adUlt standard? 

Society teaches children to be indifferent touJard people s lives 
By bUd .. n Lytle 
ConttibutirW Opinion Writer 

ublic outcry to try juveniles 
who·commit violent crimes u 
adults is bued upon an irratio-
nal frenzy rather than an hon-
est search for solutions and jus-
tice. VIOlent juvenile crime in-

creased by 4S percent between 1982 and 1992, 
and we are appropriately frightened that our 
children are losing their innocence. But adult 
violent crime increucd by 41 percent during 
the same time frame. Are our children rcaJly 
out of control or are they simply mimicking 
their elders? More children die at the hands 
of their parents or guardians than by the sense-
less deeds of each other, but we persist to ques-
tion the origins of their morals. The answer: 
our children are reflections of ourselves. 

Understanding that adult behavior influ-
enccs our children's behavior docs not relieve 
juveniles who commit crimes of personal re-
sponsibility for their actions, but it is the first 
step toward finding a solution to a problem 
which is not individUal, but social. If crime 
were an aberrant, individual problem, we 
could limply lock up those few delinquents, 
throw away the key and thereby ensure pub-

lic safety. 
However, this is not the case. As long u 

our children are uneducated, do not possess 
competitive job skills and live in constant 
hunger, crime will be an ever-present part of 
our society. James Baldwin wrote that what 
we should fear most is the person who hu 
IIOlhing to lose. The conditions under which 
many of our children develop are suffocating, 
unbearable and dangerous for all of us; they 
have nothing to lose - not possessions, not 
position, not love. 

The core argument in support of sending a 

child to an adult court is one of public safety. 
We assume that the youths who are waivercd 
to adult courts are guilty of serious and vio-
lent crimea and need to be removed from s0-
ciety for public safety. We have been con-
vinced that violent youths slide through the 
juvenile court system with a slap on the wrist 
and lenient sentences which allow them to es-
cape the consequences of their actions. We, 
without reason, believe that youths are given 
longer, harsber sentences in adult courts than

Juveniles who 
commit violent 
crimes must 
pay adult 
consequences 
By Derek van Horten 
Staff Writer 

-"""'IIII.ourteen-year-old Tony 
Hicks became an adull on 
May 4, 1995. ThaI same 
day, San Diego Superior 
Court Judge Federico 
Castro decided that Hicks 

would become the youngest person in 
California to stand trial as an adult . 

However, some would argue that 
Hicks actually became an adult on Jan. 
21, the day he brutally, yet casually, 
murdered Tariq Khamisa, a 20-year-old 
pizza delivery man in North Park. 
Hicks became the first Californian to 
fali subject to a new law passed at the 
beginning of this year which permits 
those over 14 years of age to be tried 
as adults for violent crimes. 

For all juveniles to fully compre-
hend the consequences of their actions, 
Californians must reform the education 
system as well as their methods of 
parenting. The implementation of this 
law is a step in the right direction and 
a necessity to help keep the public safe. 
Proponents of the new law rightfully 
argue that it exists for precisely Hicks ' 
type of case - if one is capable of con-
templating ·and carrying out a violent 
crime, he should be subject to full pros-
ecution. Opponents of the new law 
counter that 14-year-olds do not real-
ize the severity of their actions and 
therefore should not be punished as 
harshly as adults. 

The debate centers around the ap-
propriate age for trying juveniles who 
have committed violent crimes. For 
example, children under the age of 10 
obviously have less of an understand-
ing of the meaning and value of hu-
man life. They should oot be held fully 
accountable for their actions. 

Nevertheless, the line blurs shortly 
thereafter. And it should blur - too 
often, people seck to establish a set age 
which determines whether or oot one 
should be tried IS an adult. Most op-
ponents of California's law seck to 
keep the age limit at 18, whereas pro-
ponents have succeeded in lowering 
the age to 14. 

The former idea is only slightly 
more foolish than the lauer. If one 
draws the line at 18, the possibility 
arises for a huge discrepancy of jus-
tice between -two people only a few 
days apart in age. A 17-ycar-old boy 
would receive a significantly lighter 
punishment than an 18-year-old man. 
Yet, no one could guarantee tbat in 
every case the 18-year-old would p0s-
sess a more sufficient understanding of 
life than the 17 -year-old. 1t would be 
unfair to prosecute one more severely 
thlln the other simply because of an 
inconsequential age difference. It 
would be equally unfair if the age limit 
were drawn at 14, or any other age for 
that matter - the same problem would 
arise. However, the new law is not a 
mandate - it simpl y permits juveniles 
14 and older to be tried as adults. Eacb 
judge determines whether or not a de-

REFLECI10N: 
Children cannot be 
tried as adults 
Continued from.... 4 
cil on Crime and Delinquency 
(NCeD) found that in California, 
"Youth adjudicated fo~ violent of-
fenses and confined in the Califor-
nia Youth Authority actually serve 
longer periods of incarceration than 
adults and juveniles sentenced to 
the Department of Corrections for 
the same crimes. " 

The public safety argument con-
sists of two fallacious premises: 
Youths receive harsher sentences in 
adult courts and the remanding of 
violent youths for longer periods of 
time will make us safer. Although 
we may catch one young criminal, 
aoother will fan through the same 
social, institutional and systematic 
cracks, and we still will not be safe 
from his or her frustration and de-
spair. 

While arguments of deterrence 
have been used to support 

MURDER: 
Age is no excuse for 
violent crime 
ContInued from.... 4 
fendant should be tried as an adult. 

Opponents claim that subjecting 
juveniles to adult punishment only 
complicates the mailer - it throws 
them into a prison system and a life 
of crime from which they can never 
escape. They also argue that the 
new law threatens to ruin the lives 
of numerous youths who could oth-
erwise be fully reformed witb 

waive ring, it hu not proven to pro-
vide significant results. For ex-
ample, while Aorida uses a manda-
tory waiver system, its violent ju-
venile-crime rate remains one of the 
highest in the nation. Deterrence 
cannot succeed without providing 
juveniles with alternatives to crime. 

A third fallacy regarding 
waivering juveniles to adult courts 
proposes that youths who are 
waive red to adult courts are only 
those who commit violent crimes. 
In 1989, the National Corrections 
Reporting Program (NCRP) showed 
that 62 percent of the juveniles un-
der 18 who were incarcerated in 
adult prisons were sentenced for 
property or olhcr non-person crimes. 
Through the media, we are only 
made aware of the most senseless 
and violent of crimes committed by 
our children. Subsequently, we as-
sume that waivering is only applied 
to the "hardened" few and hope that 
adult courts will show less leniency. 
Very little of the media 's propa-
ganda rings true in reality. 

Because justice is subjective, the 

proper rehabilitation. Yet these op-
ponents are overreacting to and 
overestimating the true effects of 
the law. 

Only an extremely small per-
centage of juveniles commit violent 
crimes whicb are subject to adult 
punishment. The new law will not 
jail the common miscreant, who 
will still go to juvenile hall and re-
habilitation centers. On tbe con-
trary, the law will send only vio-
lent offenders to jail, offenders who 
are certainly IlOl common, but have 
instead proved to be menaces to so-
ciety. 

The UCSD Guardian 

application of waivers is suspect. 
Several reports bave shown that 
minority youth are more likely to be 
viewed as unsalvageable and re-
manded to adult courts. In a 1993 
NCCD study, minority juvenile de-
tention rates were higher than those 
of white juveniles. A 1987 report 
published in Crime and Delin-
quency cited that "waiver decisions 
are appl ied ina raciall y disparate 
manner." 

Another point to consider is that 
juveniles in 42 states transferred to 
adult courts can be detained in adult 
jails before and during their trials. 
A child who is innocent of an ac-
cused crime but incarcerated in an 
adult jail for days, weeks or months 
will fall prey to career criminals. 
Juvenile facilities are not detention 
havens, but they do not compare to 
adult jails. An innocent child may 
escape with his sanity from a juve-
nile facility - but detention in an 
adult facility may cause irreparable 
damage. 

As citizens, we are outraged 
when we hear of senseless and hor-

Furthermore, tougher punish-
ment would act as a deterrent for 
juveniles. Opponents of 
California's new law accurately ar-
gue that juveniles do not fully un-
derstand or comprehend the sever-
ity or consequences of their ac-
tions. However, promising tbem 
that they won't be punished as 
adults will only convince them that 
they can get away with murder. The 
example of Tony Hicks will show 
other juveniles that now they can-
not get away with it. 

Opponents say that current laws 
of this type, such as the ones in 11-

rific crimes. Yet, our rage cannol 
. reduce itself to revenge - it is one 
thing for victims or their loved ones 
to want revenge, but it is another for 
society to practice it Before we con-
tinue to support and demand waiv-
ers, we must understand its true ap-
plications arid outcomes. The major-
ity of children tried IS adults are oot 
violent offenders. When waivercd 10 
adult courts, juveniles actually re-
ceive lighter punishments. We must 
stop believing in newspaper and 
television stories as truths - thei r 
incompleteness makes them false. 
The facts contradict what the press 
leads us to believe. 

When we stop relying on the 
press for facts, we will stop relying 
on punishment as a solution. Chal-
lenging the systems and institutioDS 
which keep children the poorest of 
all AmericaDS will curb violence. 
We cannot continue to emotionally 
and intellectually cripple our chil-
dren and then blame them for limp-
ing. We are responsible for our 
children's success or failure. The les-
sons they learn are our responsibil-

linois, Aorida and New York, have 
all failed to reduce the number of 
violent crimes committed by juve-
niles. Certainly the attempts to stop 
these crimes have been unsuccess-
ful, but only because judges have 
been inadequate and over-lenient. 
Too often, the judges and juries in 
these trials place excessive· empha-
sis on the defendants' ages, result-
ing in petty sentencing. If the 
judges actually tried the juveniles 
as adults and sentenced tbem ac-
cordingly, we would see a dramatic 
decline in juvenile crime. 

However successful we may be

ity. This concern must extend not 
only to our children by blood, but 
all children. As Marian Wright 
Edelman, founder and president of 
the Children's Defense Fund, said, 
"I heard the saddest story of a 
middle class white father who had 
lost his son to random violence. And 
he wu being comforted by a friend 
who said the man had done every-
thing he could to protect his child. 
He'd moved to the right area, 
moved out to the suburbs. He sent 
his child to the best schools. And 
he should not feel guilty about this 
tragedy that had occurred. The fa-
ther reminded him that he did oot 
do everything he could to protect his 
child because he did not spend time 
protecting other people's children 
and seeing to it that they had a de-
cent place to live." 

If not comjiclled by compassion, 
a basic desire II,! protect those we 
love should drive us to protect, nur-
ture and provide for all children. To 
prevent tragedy from striking our 
own home, we must help children 
in each home across the nation. 

at issuing the proper punishment, 
we must not forget that a failing 
education system and poor 
parenting are to blame. Schools and 
parents must teach children that 
killing is wrong, and the state must 
legitimize tbis tcaching by punish-
ing those who go against it. 

Punishment should not be re-
stricted to those over 18. While we 
reform education and parenting, we 
need to continue to treat violent of-
fenders harshly. Juveniles under 18 
are still capable of contemplating 
and committing murder. Tariq 
Khamisa is testimony.

SAN FRANCISCO - After an in-
tensive, six-year effort to settle on a site 
for the lOtb University of California 
campus, the UC Board of Regents voted 
Thursday to approve the Lake Yosemite 
location over the other finalist, Table 
Mountain in Madera County. 

The new campus, which will be the 
first UC in Central California, is tenta-
tively slated to open by 2005, though 
UC officials say no construction will 
begin until the university secures state 
funding. 

Following testimony from more than 
25 speakers, the regents voted 14 to 
five in favor of the Merced County 
Lake Yosemite site. Peltason, who ini-
tially backed the Madera location, later 
reversed his vote, making the final tally 
15 to four. 

"The impact this will have on stu-
dents in Merced is incredible," she 
said. "It's an amazing moment." 

Many of the regents read and com-
pared letters that they had received 
supporting the Lake Yosemite campus 
when tbeir names were called for the 
roll-all vote. Student Regent-desig-
nate Edward Gomez said that be, too, 
had received mail favoring the Lake 
Yosemite location. 

"I got a postcard from God. He told 
me to vote for Merced," said Gomez. 

According to Regent Clair 
Burgener, the primary issue was deter-
mining which site had a better chance 
of becoming a university in the near 
future. 

"If we choose Yosemite, it's going 
to happen," he said. 

Echoing the sentiments of other re-

sion of the facts." 

In contrast, several Merced County 
government and business leaders said 
water availability would not be an 
issue at the Lake Yosemite site. 

"Lake Yosemite has the most 
ample supply of water; said Simon 
Gray, of the Merced County Board of 
Supervisors, adding that water is the 
most important consideration for 
building in the Valley. 

The county promised the univer-
sity that if the new campus was build 
at Merced, it would receive 100 per-
cent of its water needs for the next 
century, something which Madera 
could not offer. 

In addition, several regents ex-
pressed concern about the availability 
of land at Table Mountain. According 
to UC officials, the Madera location is 
owned by seven different parties, and 
negotiations between them and tbe un i-

the UC's race- and gender-attentive

ther disruptions. 

"There is no dispute ... amongst 
this board, tbat diversity in the stu-
dent body. in the faculty, in the 
University of California is a very, 
very important thing," Flinn said. 
"But I think what people [kind of 
miSs) sometimes is what it is that the 
other side is complaining about." 

During the public comment pe-
riod, only one out of the 16 speakers 
expressed opposition to affirmative 
action. 

Outgoing UC Berkeley A.S. 
President Andrew Wong was the 
only dissenting voice on affirmative 
action, saying that the UC's race-
based programs "threaten a lot of 
the relations and a lot of the bonds 
that develop on our campus." 

Citing a survey conduc:ted by the 
A.S. Council at Berkeley, WODg said 
tbat while 80 percent of Berkeley 
students support the goal of diver-
sity, 59 percent said 
that admissions 

public support for legislation aim-
ing to eliminate race- and gender-
attentive policies in California, the 
UC has begun the procesa of ovalu-

At tbe March regents meeting in 
Los Angeles, Peltason reaffirmed 
his support of the univeraity's ad-
missions policies and outreach pro-
grams, but said that they may need 
to be modified to "ensure fairness." 

While the board is not expected 
to make any decisions Oft the issue 
this year, they will take up affirma-
tive action at their UCLA mee&iag 
next month. 

At tbe re-
opening of the 
meeting, Re-
gent David 
Flinn called for 
dialogue rather 
than "confron-
tational debate" 
on the difficult 
issue of affirma-
tive-action.

President of External Affairs Steve 
Dubb defended university affirma-
tive-action programs, saying, "I'm 
embarrassed for those who've been 
fooled into thinking that. .. 'unquali-
fied minority students' are prevent-
ing qual ified white students from at-
tending the University of Cali fomi a." 

should be based 
solely on qualifica-
tions, not race. Ac-
cording to Wong, 
the majority of Af-
rican Americans . 
and Chicanos have 
similar opinions 
about affirmative-
action.

Rather than scrutinizing affirma-
tive action, Dubb said, the univer-
sity should focus its energy on ex-
panding enrollment. According to 
Dubb, only eight percent of the 
state's graduating seniors attend a 
UC today, as opposed to 10 percent 
a decade ago.

Sigma Chi 
Derby Days 95 

Under the widespread 
wings of the Sun God, Sigma Chi 
held its 6th Annual Derby Days. 
The campus wide philanthropy 
involving sororities on campus 
annually raises money for a 
national and local charity. This 
year's donations were well 
received by the Children's 
Miracle Network, a nationwide 
alliance of 160 hospitalS and 
health care facilities around the 
nation for children. The local 
charity which benefits from the . 
four day philanthropy is the 
Coalition for the Homeless, a 
shelter which provides 
underprivUegedchildreninthe 
San Diego area with a positive 
environment in which to mature. 

The week began with 
the 2nd Annual Derby Days Pub 
Night at Porter's Pub. The event 
draws several hundred 
enthusiastic music lovers to listen 
to the local band, "Oversoul/ 
and the Long Beach based "'Davis 
Form." Over $350 was raised 

. through donations ~eived at the 
door and the event drew persons 
from all comers of campus. The 
event was co-spOnsored by the 
ASUCSD and is an example of 
their ongoin..s effort to bring the 
campus together around stellar 
programming. 

At midnight, 
surrounded by an entourage of 
well-wishers, the Sigma Chi 
fraternity put up its famous 
Derby Days swing set. The 36 
hour straight swing-a-thon at the 
Sun God provided a base camp 
for the week's events, which 
included the Derby Days 
Barbecue and "Sign-a-Sig." The 
curious onlookers who passed by 
during the week supported the 
event through donations and 
barbecue tickets, which were 
used to purchase "Rally's" 
hamburgers, the major sponsor of 
the barbecue and "Smith's" 
grocery store sodas. 

The "Un-Olympics," a 
new event for Derby Days 
provided some but-deserved 
laughs for the sororities as they 
saw their Sigma Chi CQaches 
stumble through the events. 

"This is great! It's a 
tenUic opportunity for all of us to 
have a great time while 
!lUpporting these worthwhile 
charities," said Tom Hackforcl, 
the inco~g president of Sigma 
Chi. "'Un;Olympics' is a great 
idea because It's an opportunity 
for all of us to relieve some of the 
stress from this week." 

Friday brought the week 
to a peak as the Up Synch 

Sports 
Update 

competition, held at the Price 
Center Plaza, drew hundreds of 
onlookers to the climax of the 
four-day event. This year, the 
Kappa Pledge class of Sigma Chi 
added a new dimension to the 
Up Synch with it's 1st annual 
Pledge Class Barbecue. 

"This is a ton of fu n," 
said Art Gorbiso, coordinator of 
the event." Watching the work 
these sororities put into this 
event and the way in which they 
exploit the active brothers is 
hilarious. " 

Saturday brought the 
event to an end with 
Philanthropy Day, an 
opportunity for the participants 
to reach out into the community. 

"This is a terrific 
opportunity for me to work off 
community service hours while 
having a good time," said Tyler 
Allison, the coach for I1B~. 

In the end, Alpha Chi 
Omega brought home their 
second consecutive Derby Days 
trophy. The coveted symbol of a 
week's worth of hard work is 
named in honor of Emilio Cruz, a 
Sigma Chi brother who passed 
on inexhaustible commitment to 
community service as an 
inspiration to everyone.

"Take me out to the 
ballgame ... " Last 
Saturday, May 20, Kappa 
Alpha Theta held its first 

ever Kats with Bats. This event, 
to be held annually, is a day-long 
fraternity softball tournament. It 
took place at Warren West field, 
from 11am to 5pm. 

The purpose of Kats 
with Bats is to raise money for 
Theta's national philanthropy, 
Court Appointed Special 
Advocates (CASA). CASA is an 
organization dedicated to helping 
abused or neglected children who 
are going through the juvenile 
court system. These children are 
'given a volunteer advocate who 
reviews their case, speaks for 
them in court and most 
importantly gives them a much 
needed friend. 

This year, eleven 
fraternities participated in the 
event: Barr, ~T~. ZBT. rrK~. 
IAE, IN, IX. I<I>E. ~~e. ~Ke, 
and FIJI. The winning fraternity 
receives both a pizza party and a 
trophy, to be passed on from year 
to year. Sponsors are Princeton 
Review, Domino's Pizza, The 
Pulse and 92.5 The Flash. 
Concessions and t-shirts were 
sold, and 92.5 will provide the 
music. May the best men win! 

• 

Kappa Kappa Gamma 
took the Sports Banner this year 
ending the year with a total of 638 
points. All sororities did well this 
year, however, Kappas 
dominated this year coming in 
first in football, water polo; Mld 
sand volleyball. Behind the 
Kappas coming in second was 
Alpha Chi Omega and, taking 
third place was Kappa AI?ha 
Theta. 

Among the other 
sororities that shined this year 
was Delta Gamma who took first 
place in the basketball 
tournament; Alpha Chi Omega 
took first place in volleyball and 
soccer; Kappa Alpha Theta 
came in first in the bowling and 
tennis tournament; and Pi Beta 
Phi ended the year taking first 
place in the softball tournament. 

In addition, this was a 
great year for building sisterhood, 
teamwork, and cooperation 
within each sorority. 
Participation and sorority support 
at each event was high this year. 
Furthermore, it was a good 
chance for each sorority to get to 
know each other through 
sportsmanlike competition. 
Overall, this was a great year for 
many sororities to be in the 
spotlight.

Three Horse Race For 
IFC Sports Banner 

Sigma Phi Epsilon . 
maintained its stranglehold on the 
IFC innertube waterpolo 
championship last week as it won its 
third straight championship in the 
event. The SigEps defeated a tired 
Tau Kappa Epsilon in the final with 
decisive 14-8 victory. The team's fire 
power came up front from John 
Borah who, as hole set, scored the 
majority of the SigEp's goals over the 
three games they played. The team 
mixed it up and got excellent outside 
support from Mike Romesser and 
Peter Shim who both had the fair 
share of scores. 

The semifinal games had 
the top four teams in the Sports 
Banner race, the first had SigEp 
playing Sigma Alpha Epsilon in a 
game that was both close and very 
physical. IAE jumped out to a qu ick 
2-0 lead, but the defense of SigEp 
kept them in the game as they 
dimbed back and came away with a 
11-7 win. 

The second semifinal game 
featured first place Sigma Chi against 
TKE. The game was extremely close, 
with neither team building up more 
than a two goal lead. Down by a goal 
late in the game, Sigma Chi scored to 
even it out as regulation ended 
sending the game to overtime. In the 
extra period, TKE controlled the ba Il 

VOlunteer. 
Connection 

The Adopt-A -School 
Program has given the UCSD Greek 
organizations a terrific opportunity 
to support the surrounding 
community. By providing 
volunteen, the Panhellenlc 
Association and Interfraternity 
Council were able to develop a 
Continuing partnership with Doyle 
and Curie Elementary Schools. The 
Greek volunteers supply the extra 
lime and instruction needed for 
hundreds of at risk children. The 
volunteen work with small groups 
of students IS well as one on one 
tutoring. which is initiated and 
supervised by the cooperating 
teacher. 

Although the program has 
been very successful in the past 
years, we would really lib to see an 
increase in the number of volunteen 
and chapters participating. 

The program no only 
provides supplemental Instruction 
for the ch1ldren. bu t also a 
rewarding experience for the 
volunteers. Furthermore, the 
volunteers become positive role 
models and develop mutually 
rewarding relationships with the 
students. As adults, we sometimes 
forget the little things that make all 
the hard work worthwhile. 
Spending lime with children really 
helps to give us • different 
perspectiw on life. No matter how 
old we are, we neect to remehiber II 
how the world looks through the 
eyes of our children. 
well and WOII14-13.

~.~~ .. ' -~~!\ .... , The championship game 
had huge importance for both ..... ms __ ;.' J/==::cl=~O=ll,..., 
if TKE won they would move into a 
lie for first with Sigma Chi, • 
for the SigEps this was their 
chance for a three-peat. The 
SigEps jumped ahead by 
using their speed advantage 
to score qUickly severallimrs 
before IKE got on the board. 
Once again the SigEp defense 
stifled the opponent as they 
had trouble getting many 
shots on goa\. In the second half it 
was SigEp going away. 

With the second place 
finish. TKE moved up to 20 points 
behind first place Sigma Chi and 17 
behind l:AE. Tomorrow marks the 
beginning of the IFC softball I 
tournament and the crowning of/this 
year's champions. As defendin2i 
champions and a first round bye) IKE 
looks to be the favorite in the 
tournament again this year, althbugh 
Sigma Chi is an improved teamjfrom 
last year's second place finish. IAE 
obviously cannot be counted out, as 
playing for the championship lvrn 
bring out mind-boggling 
performances. It should be an 
exciting finish.

versity remained open but uncertain. 

Proponentsofthe Merced County 
location also touted the Virginil 
Smith Trust's donation of 2,000 
ICres of land at Lake Yosemite, 
which would save the UC an esti-
I1lIted $333 million - the projected 
cost of the Table Mountain land. 

However, supporters of the 
Madera County site argued that Lake 
Yosemite is not close enough to a 
major population center, unlike 
Table Mountain, which is just north 
of Fresno. "We're loosing sight of 
what the objective should be," said 
Nakashima. "Fresno is the heart of 
not only the San Joaquin Valley, but 
of the state." 

Regent Roy Brophy, however, 
said that while Lake Yosemite may 
be isolated from the cullural and 
economic benefits of a major city, 
the "University of Californil cre-
ates its own community." 

Thursday's vote marked the end of 
the UC's Site Selection Task Force's 
lICarch for a San Joaquin Valley loca-
tion for the next UC campus. 

The Board of Regents decided in 
1990 to build the next UC in the 
Central Valley area, citing rapid 
populltion growth and low UC at-
tendance among Valley high school 
graduates. According to a university 
study, 50 percent fewer San Joaquin 
Valley high school grlduates attend 
the UC than their northern and south-
ern counterparts. 

Drawing from an original pool of 
85 candidates, the task force for-
warded the two finalists to UC Presi-
dent Jack Peltason last month. 
Peltason, who was expected to en-
dorse one of the two sites, included 
both the Lake Yosemite .and Table 
Mountain locations in his recommen-
dation, saying that the importance of 
the decision implored him to draw 
upon the "collective wisdom of the 
board." 

According to UC officials, the

university will not begin planning ' 
or construction of the Merced cam-
pus - estimated at S600 million -
until the state provides funding for 
the project.' . 

"We have no immediate plans to 
develop this campus - we hive no 
resources," said Chairman of the 
Board Howard Lelch. "As you 
know, we're struggling to stabilize 
the university, to mlintain the cam-
puses that we have. " 

According to Vice President for 
University and External Relations 
William Baker, the construction of 
the 10th UC is likely to be "fueled 
by demographics." 

"Whether the campus is open in 
1 0 years or 15 years, it's going to 
depend not just on funding, it's go-
ing to depend on Ihe number of 
students seeking access to the uni-
versity." 

According to several demo-
graphic studies, the number of col-
lege-age students is estimated to in-
crease by 450,000 by the yelr 2004.

PCRC: Tritons 
capture third overall 
Continued from .,... 18 

The Tritons battled traditional 
power OCC all the way down the 
course, but missed the third posi-
tion as OCC finished in 6: t 2.7 
compared to UCSD's 6:13.4. 

"I'm very proud of my guys," 
men's Head Coach Doug 
Thiemann said. "We were the 
first UCSD crew to ever be in the 
grand final [at PCRCs) and to 
lose by only seven-lOths to a 
program like OCC that produces 
rowers that go on to the best Div. 
1 programs clearly earned us a 
measure of respect." 

"These guys have set a new 
standard," Thiemann added. 

The final men's boat was a 
quad competing in the sculling 
discipline. The Tritons had only 
one opponent to beat and did so, 
downing the squad from Sacra-
mento State to win the event for 
the second time in three years. 

The season's end marked the 
end of careers for six four-year 
rowers whom Thiemann praised 
for their "commitment to the 
program." The departing seniors 
are John Roosendaal, Marcus 
O'Brien, EvanJacobs, Eric Friez, 
Erik Baker and Scott Mounier.

said. "We had a couple of bogeys 
and double bogeys in the last few 
holes that really hurt us. Take away 
some of those things, and we could 
have taken second place." 

Despite the rough ending for 
UCSD, there were some bright spots. 
Behrend hit a shot that Wydra called

club. 
Behrend's amazing shot wasn't 

the only Triton highlight. Captain 
Tom Brown racked up an incredible 
final round, stroking a sub-par 72. 
His 229 total earned him a three-
way tie for eighth place on the indi-
vidual leader board. 

Fellow Triton Pete Roberts, play-
ing with severe wrist pain, notched 
a 230. Thanks to a consistent 76-77-
77 three-round performance, Rob-
erts tied for the 11th-place individual 

spot overall. a "top-tO highlight of 
my coaching career." 
At the 17th hole of the 
final round, Behrend 
found himself in the 
rough, 153 yards from 
the pin and obstructed 
by a large tree.

Haute, IN 

"I can't say enough 
about [Roberts)," 
Wydra said. "Every 
shot he was in pain. 
He's the epitome of a 
team player." 

"Hisbackswingwas 
blocked, so 1 told him 
to slowly take the club 
back between the 
branches. It's a penalty 
to knock off a branch, 
so we had to be careful. 
And there was a USGA 
guy in a cart watching 
us," Wydra said.

THE [YnI[ 
. SEAN RAHIMI 

And Then 
There Were ... 

Four teams remain in the 
NBA playoffs. A pair of Texas 
twisters will do battle out west, 
while Shaq and Reggie duke it 
out in the East for the right to 
replace the Bricks in the finals. 
Now for a few notes. 

Too Many Centen 
I was just getting comfort-

able watching the three-headed 
monster (Longley, Purdue and 
Wennington) in Chicago and 
the white-boy tandem in 
Phoenix dominate in the paint. 
Now I'll have to settle for the 
top-four centers in the game. 
Patrick Ewing dismissed 
himself from the top four when 
he traveled to the hoop only to 
blow a lay-up that Luc Longley 
could have put in. As Ewing 
did in game 5 at the Garden, he 
took 10 steps toward the rack 
on Sunday in search of the 
tying basket but this time he 
blew tbe lay-up. That leaves us 
with Shaq vs. The Dunking 
Dutchman and The Dream vs. 
The Admiral. It doesn't get any 
better than this. 

Cyalc PredIction 
San Antonio will come out 

of the west and blow past 
Miller and company who will 
survive the Shaq attack at 
Disneyworld. How can I go 
against the fuchsja hair of 
Tattoo Rodman? So, dOf\'t 
come to me in two weeks and 
say, "You were right Cynic, I 
should have put 50 Andrew 
Jacksons on San Antonio." 

LuckyLoUo 
Could my beloved Golden 

State Warriors win the first 
pick of the 1995 Draft? They 
have no coach (Rick Adelman 
does not count), bad chemistry 
and yellow road uniforms. The 
Warriors had a 9.5% chance of 
grabbing the first pick. Why, 
then, is the Oakland franchise 
blessed with the first pick 
overall, you ask? 

Because the Basketball 
Gods felt sorry for us, that's 
why. They looked down and 
saw Chris Webber representing 
the Bullets in the lottery studio 
in Jersey. That whiny, pomp-
ous, no-good, cry-baby, time-
out taking fool from Michigan 
ruined our season. How dare he 
hold out and complain about 
Coacb Nelson. Last time I 
looked, coaches give orders 
and players follow tbem. 
Nobody said coaches are 
always right, but they are the 
~nes with the Armani suits. 

For now, I can revel in the 
idea of Chris Webber playing 
10 more years in Washington.

llitons Show Their Medal 
BIG BRONZE: UCSD garnered its share of top-notch finishes en route to third overall at PCRes 
By Dan Kraft 
Associate Spoits Editor 

After months of preparation, 
weeks of anticipation and hours of 
last-minute inspiration, the UCSD 

crew team fi-
nally got its shot 
at the best in the ' 
west last week-
end. The Tri-
tons traveled to 
Sacramento to 
compete in the 
Pacific Coast 

Rowing Championships (PCRCs) 
on Saturday and Sunday and made 
their presence clearly felt. 

The PeRCs marked the culmi-
nation of all the hours of intense 
practice put in since the onset of the 

training season. 
The combined efforts of the 

men's and women's squads earned 
UCSD a third-place overall finish in 
the highly regarded event 

"It is one of the best seasons 
we've had in a long time," UCSD 
women's Head Coach Jack Vallerga 
said. 

The only gold medal of the week-
end was captured by the women's 
novice 'B' crew. The Tritons 
haunted their overmatched compe-
tition to the tune of a 13 second 
cushion when tbey blazed across 
the finish line nearly four full lengths 
ahead of UC Davis. 

The women's novice 'A' crew 
also had a solid showing. The Tri-
tons captured first place in the petite 

final with a time of 7:14 narrowly 
edging out arch-rival UC Davis 
(7: 15) for the win. That result earned 
UCSD a seventh-place finish over-
all among the 21 competing boats. 

"The novices were wonderful; 
they're our future," Vallerga said. 

The women of the light-weight 
four boat grabbed second place jn 
their event in what Vallerga termed 
a "heartbreaking" loss. The midwest 
champion, University of Colorado, 
topped the Tritons by a mere four 
seconds as they cafhe across the li~e 
in 7:55 to beat UCSD's 7:59. 

However, the Tritons' perfor-
mance was enough to qualify them 
for NCAAs which will be held in 
Cincinnati, Ohio in three weeks. If 
the team can raise the money, cox-

swain Darci Tilly will lead her four-
woman crew of Marika Page, 
Adrianne Cunningham, Melissa 
Sarmaian and Jennifer Meyers up 
against the big boys next month. 

The UCSD women's varsity four 
boat escaped from a tight race with 
a fourth-place marking amongst the 
hearty competition. Mills College 
won the race in a time of 7:33 fol-
lowed by the University of Oregon 
(the only Pac-10 school in atten-
dance), Humboldt State and then 
UCSD (7:59). 

For the men, the results were 
equally positive. The varsity-eight 
squad found itself in a dogfight as 
expected and escaped from the fray 
with a fourth-place finish.

Fabulous Four Finish 
RNALE: The Tritons took fourth at the NCAAs in Terre Haute, IN 
By Tedd Ladd 
Sports Editor 

Every year, UCSD golf coach 
Mike Wydra picks the five play-
ers he predicts will make 
up the Triton NCAA Na-
tional squad. He writes 
down the names on a 
sheet of paper, seals it in 
an envelope and locks it 
in the golf shed, to be 
opened when -NCAA 
time" rolls around again. 
Every year, he has been 
right - including this one. 

But even Wydra couldn't en-

vision the spectacular perfor-
mance of Alex Behrend at last 
weekend's Division III Golf 
Championships in Terre Haute, 

IN. The veteran-
Triton standout 
shot a 225-stroke 
total, pushing him 
into a three-way tie 
for second overall 
behind champion 
Ryan Jenkins of 
Methodist College 
who shot a 218. 

"[Behrend] is a mighty mite," 
Wydra said. "No one expected 

him to do very well, but he hung 
in there." 

Behrend led the way for his 
UCSD teammates, chalking up a 
pair of 74 s in the first two rounds 
of play before slipping to a 77 in 
the final round. As it was, his 
efforts allowed the Tritons to snag 
fourth in a crowded field of 
schools, with a 926 team total. 
Methodist (899), Otterbein (917) 
and John Carroll (924) grabbed 
the top three slots, respectively. 

"The boys are disappointed, 
mainly witb our finish," Wydra
