By CHRISTOPHER CANOLE 

Thc 19tH UCSD AS Elections may lack the exc itement, luster and heated 
deb.lte of the current national primary elecuons , but the runoff s bClIlg hcld this 
wee k to determine live mJJor Pllsltions m,I}' nl)W cre.HC a d}'11Jmic two-party 
cnl rontatl on between SPUO and the AS Express. 

William Ansel. commiSSioner 01 elc..:tlons, who has conducted the 1Il0St 
ellic lent operation in recent UCSD history, announced runoll elections Will be 
conducted Wednesday, Apri l 25 , from 9 alll to 4 pill at the Gym and on the 
Revelle Plaza. 

Though the candidates for the m,~or AS positions are still waiting lor the 
second shoe to drop , the student body deCidedly put its foot down on the issue 
01 Alternative Media. This year's AS Councl! has repeatedly "claimed" that the 
student body does not support the Alternative Media and that the Council was 
acting in the best interests of the students at large each time the Council voted 
media changes or budget cuts. In an ellort to prove their point, the N:> Council 
presented the issue as a ballot referendum. Traditionally, students will vote !n 
fa vor 01 saving themselves money, unless rhey thll1k that money IS being spent 
for their benelit. As in last spring's referendum in which the students voted 
down AS stipends. this year they have given the AS Council their direct 
statement: do not cut the Alternative Media budget. What would h.lVe been the 
results had the Council also created referendums on TGs, fundmg lor KSDT, 
boycoulOg Coors and the AS Calendar? 

ThIS year, 2546 students voted in the cle tions, which tot.lls 24.7% 01 the 
ampus population. ThiS is stili a disturbingly low turnout, although 9'h, greater 

rhan last )'car's turnout. Interesringly enough, a large percentage of those who 
vOted did not VOle 111 <Ill categones. Even the AS Presidential count had more 
than 200 blank responses.

according 10 Harold Guy, 
MD , a speCialist in the 
UCSD Depanment of 
Medicine and cechlllcal 
director of Ihe project. 

first, from a practical 
medical perspective, it is 
Important to understand 
any changes that occur in 
[he lungs of astronauts at 
zero gravity, It is known, 
lor example, that in a 
zero-gravity environment 
the action of the 
ci rculatOry system forces 
blood to now up, towards 
the head, It is thiS 
redistribution of blood 
that makes the astronauts' 
faces look purry. Guy 
explai ned, The lung is 
thought to become 
engorged with blood 
because of this 
redistribution, though it 
probably adapts after a 
day or two in space,

BOOKST RE 

"La Cape 
By CHRISTOPHER CANOLE 

Carole unrastened the bow of her 
birthday girt, and when she pulled the 
cape from its cocoon she knew I had 
remembered her childhood dre.lm , to 
dance and stroll in thc woods draped In 
velvet and satin. As a tear fell on the 
cape's hood, she whispered, "I chnsten 
thee 'GandolL"' That was Carole's way of 
touching the world - she had long ago 
chnstened me "Strider" arter the wood 
pnnce character from fhe Lurd oj the 
RlIlgs. 

The e nchantment 01 our marriage 
lasted two more years. I had foolIshly 
taken on a ITIlstress, and I was orr to 
Pans. My last memory 01 Carole was 01 
her standing on the snowbound balcony 
01 Kennedy Airport waving larewell. As 
she laded rrom sight, her small,' flOWing 
red cape against the white snow 
reminded me 01 my d,lys as a lencer, of 
the red heart on the white lenclng 
jacket I tumed from the window and 
gazed upon my new love beside me, a 
portrolio 01 my art . 

I arm'ed In Pans Just hours before the 
opening of the Biennale de Paris, where 
my photographs and sculptures were to 
be exh ibited a~ a repre~entatlon 01 
young American an. 

Onc alternoon , a hlack cape dnlted 
IntO the an mU5eum, and from behind 
the hood, a voice introduced herself as 
Berta Domingas D., Wife 01 Alex Salklnd , 
producer of fhe Three Musketcers and 
the upcoming Supcnnall. "I have heard 
01 your art, and I want you [0 come 
make movies with Alex and l." This 
woman was too powerful [0 be artificial. 
"We are making a fantasy , 'Prince 
Milliagra ,' and you shall play the brother 
to Peter O'Toole who accidentaUy slays 
you during a fenCing practice. Later 
Peter will halluci nate bizarre images 
whi h will he displays of your art." If 
this was a Iamasy, I was eager to take 
the challenge, ror since my boyhood my 
manliness was based on the image 01 
Peter O'Toole striding atop a train a~ 
i...<lwrenc!! 01 Arabia, with hiS long, 
nowlng cape and tall boots. 

Everything was done In capes. Berta 
and Alex were lascinatcd With capes, 
silk Chlncse, stripped Moroccan. 
colorful MeXican, powerful German and 

Simple peasant. It was no wonder they 
were making a movlc about a caped 
crusader. lor most 01 our hours verc 
spem talking about ho" to gl\'e the 
Impressiun Superman Glil fly with 1115 
cape billOWing m the wind. One eve we 
took a break from the problems 01 
Superman and all dressed In black 
capes to attend the premiere of Lc 
GUCITC des Etoilcs, Berta, Alex, myself and 
Superman himselr, Christopher Reeve. 
We were a Sight , like Jedi knights, as we 
marched along the Champs Elysees. 

The next murning I caught the Metro 
lor the Salkinds' country cottage to 
recuperate lrom the festivities [0 which I 
was unaccustomed . Arriving at Momabe, 
I looked from Inside the frosted window 
or thc train to see a lie. 1 market island 
in the snow. With all the activity 01 the 
night before, I had lorgotten it was 
Chnstmas cve day. 

Wandering through the booth , I 
came upon a table mountalned with 
"Ibncs. Rcaching Into my pocket, I 
handed the young wOl11an a Wrinkled

said, -Avez Vous?" She spoke In Engltsh 
as stnllned as I In French, "No clothes, 
Just doth ." Under tanding the 
confusion, I lOre the center lrom the ad 
so she could see I was looking lor a 
partlcubr type of material Her response 
was one of Immediate recognition -
she dug deep Into the colors, and there 
It was. ThiS was no ordinary brown , for 

J~ you drew near, tiny stars 01 colurs 
glimmered In the sunlIght. This was the 
doth 01 J wood prince . I pulled the 
doth free and cocooned mysell In the 
yards of magic. She smiled and said, 
"Ah, la Cape." 

The walk rrom the station to the 
cottage was J little dIfftcult wrapped In 
my unsewn cape. [he seamstress who 
lIved next to the S.llklnds c.tlled to me , 
Is tillS a new sculpture]" I gestured 

wlidl}" almost failing, -Yc~ Yes I shall 
create a work or art, an homage to la 
Cape." I asked her if she had a sewing 
l11aLhllle I could borrow. I had torgotten 
thIS was a peJsant Village She came to 
the door and handed me J hand crank 
machlile that looked like It \\'a~ hUllt In 
the middle ages 

It was to be a Wizard'S night Alone In 
the cott,lge, one Christmas candle 
Ihckenng, capes hung on chairs and hat 
st,mds as models, and black metal anVil 
to pound out my mantle 01 manlIness, 
these would be my aSSistant:> In magic. 
The huod would be lrom Morocco, 

~houlder from London Fog, long lines 
lrom Austrian nobility, arm slits Irom the 
VatlcJn, fasteners from ChlnJ, fullness 
lrom hakespearean theater, colors from 
nature and lower edge trom peasant 
stock My arm eagerly turned the ,tnvil's 
\\ heel lIke that of an Infatuated youth 
lost In thc excitement 01 love But my 
body soon tired of this love's Intenslt) 
01 dfort. The se.lIns seemed to extend 
for mlies Tn,lI1gle by triangle of earthen 
colored fabnc CJme together like an 
Egyptian pyramid . N, the candle 
lIattened , the capes around me grew 
taller as witnesses of that night's 
birthing. 

"Merry Christmas D'Artagnan," Alex 
bellowed, as he stood in the doorway 
holding a long pair 01 boots. He then 
laughed at the Sight 01 me huddled on 
the IIoor beneath my cape "Back from 
the Crusades, I sec." He louked around 
the room to all the capes, observing, 
-Ah, a round room of MerlIns." As he 
spoke, my mind and eyes began to 
dear. I IInally recogntzed the nature of 
the black leJther h.lI1glng lrom hiS 
hand . Leaping lrom the Iloor, I sn.uched 
the boots Irol11 Alex, ran Into the woods, 
then rully caped I strode wearing my 
over-the-knee Musketeer boots 

For [\"'0 months I strode throughout 

Apnl23, 1984 13 

Pans as a Renaissance man. Paris was a 
cny that accepted all forms or behavior, 
however strange. Wherever I went, 
people would call out '"D'Artagnan," ror I 
was known as the artist who lived with 
the Sa lklllds. 

The next Halloween, an actress 
borrowed my cape, boOts and 
Renaissance shin. I arrived late to the 
party, weanng what I then considered to 
be a costume, a three-piece blue velvet 
suit. Stepping Into the anteroom , I 
looked Into the rull length mirror to 
check my new Image . Then my twm 
stood beSide me adjusting her rake 
beard. Ironically, that evening we were 
all gOing to see Alex's latest mOVie, 
Crossed Swords , a remake or The Pnncc 
and the Pauper. The effect was tOO 
disturbing to handle. There standing 
beSide me , refle( ted In the mirror, was 
all that I was, an Image. 

That was my last night II) Pans. After 
explamlng my dilemma [0 Alex, I 
boarded the next night to San Diego, 
home I called J rnend Irom ew York 
to pick me up when I arrived, and he 
s<:lld he wuuld take care or things. That 
hI: did Evel)'one I knew was there upon 
my arrival. or I should say upon the 
arrival 01 my Image. At the tune , all I 
owned ",,"as my cape, boots, shirt and 
pants. And lor a while I allowed the 
cape to be me. 

Needing to rediscover the world 
around me, I moved back to the 
euLai>'Ptus forest or UCSD, liVing and 
sleepmg In m)' cape. I was rediscovenng 
m} Identity with nature. Like the 
coloration 01 a lawn deer, the cape 
helped me blend into the rallen 
eUlJI)ptus Icaves as I slept. The .tnllnals 
wok me as one of their o\\n , or was It 
the capc they Jccepted] 

One morning, two Joggers trampled 
me . Stunned, they apologized, "Sorry, 
there dldn't seem to be anybody there." 
Invisible] Had I now lost even my 
phYSical character to the cape? 

Feanng I had little time before the 
final metamorphosis, I ran [0 the ocean 
dins to rid myself of the cape. As I 
reached the edge, I thought or aU the 
old movlcs with the climatic scene at 
lovers leap. Old I want to let go? Before 
I could answer, a powerful gust tore the 
cape lrom my shoulders. All I could do 
was stand there watching the cape soar 
duwnward to the caves below. 

Not being able to let it end thiS way, I 
climbed down to lind where it had 
landed Reaching a cave JUSt above the 
watcr line , I saw the cape . It lay 
sheltered inSide me cave, folded neatly, 
as If waning for someone . But nO[ me I 
had [0 chmh back into my human 
world.

Notoriety on the Nile 
By BONNIE HOWELL 

Have you ever wondered what it 
would be like to be a celebnry? To be 
recognized by everyone, followed by 
hordes of people wanting to lOuch you? 
Well , for young, whIte people, especIally 
blonde women, Instant celehrity status 
awaits you In Egypt. 

Walking down the street 01 d smdll 
town 111 Eg}'Pt there are lorever ten to 
12 children rushing over to you to tr}' 
out the most rudImentary Engilsh 
phrases whi h they h:l\e ICdrncd 111 
school. The result IS a constant string 01 
"Hello ," "What IS your name?" "How old 
are you?" or "How are yuu?" Each of 
these children knu\V~ a maxImum of 
one or twO phrases ,md has httle 
conception 01 what a response mIght be 
and thus mindlessly repeats hIS or her 
one phrase . Imagine being surrounded 
by little faces , each saymg one EnglIsh 
phrase - ten llInes fast. 

There is of course the occasional 
opportunity for response; in this 
situation there are tWO routes one can 
follow. The first IS lO respond In perlect 
textbook phrases, ("I am fmc , how arc 
you ?") The response IS absolute dehght 
In recognition and the usual repetition 
of the phrase. Alternately, one can 
choose a more ridIculous route such as 

rcsponding that onc's name is 
"Mohammed," the response here being 
confUSIOn and , Inel'ltably, the repeulion 
of the phrase . 

In most cases, your cclebnt}, statuS In 
tg}'Pt IS the result 01 a genuine helplul 
friendlIness in the Eg}'Ptian people An}'

The Bill - B 1563 by Garamendi : Student Voter Registration. This bill 
would require the Regents or the University or Calirornia, the Trustees of 
the Caltfornia State University, and the Board of Governors of the 
Calirornia Community Colleges to adopt rules and regulations requiring the 
inclusion of voter registration rorms within the course registration packets 
or each student enrolled in these institutions. 
Arguments - 1) The use of course registration packets for dlstributlng 
voter registration rorms is an effective way to reach every student. 2) 
Students change residences more rrequently than the general population 
and , thus, must re-register to vote more rrequently. Providing voter 
registration rorms in course registration packets will orrset the burdent or 
constantly re-registeri ng to vote. 3) Most students vote for the Hrst time 
during college. EHons to develop good voting habits should be encouraged 
rrom the beginning so that the habits will continue throughout lire . 4) The 
cost or the program will be minimal because the coUegesalready pay ror the 
distribution of course registration packets. 5) The use or postcard Voter 
registration in Calirornia is ideal for such a program. 
Who to Write - S8 1563 will be heard either on the Senate Floor or in 
Senate Finance Committee. At this point. we urge you to write to 
representatives or the San Diego area and in particular, the two leglslators

The toughest job 
you'D ever love 

We admit it. It takes a dif-
ferent kind of person to be a Peace 
Corps volunteer. 

We won't mislead you with 
glowing pictures of exotic lands. The 
hours as a volunteer are long. The 
pay is modest. And the frustrations 
sometimes seem overwhelming. But 
the satisfaction and rewards are im-
mense. You'll be immersed in a new 
culture, become fluent in a new 
language, and learn far more about 
the third world - and yourself -
than you ever expected. 

You'll also discover that prog-
ress brought about by Peace Corps 
volunteers is visible and measurable: 
Such as health clinics establi shed in 
the Philippines; Fresh-water fish 
ponds constructed in Kenya: road 
and schools and irrigation systems 
buill in Upper Volta; tens of thou-
sands of people given e~sential ~ki ll s 
in farming, nutrition, the skilled 

trades, business, forestry, and other 
specialties throughout the develop-
ing world . 

Being a volunteer isn't for 
everyone, and it isn't easy, but to the 
people of the developing nations 
who have never before had basic 
health care or enough to eat, the 
Peace Corps brings a message of 
hope and change. 

We invite you to look into the 
vo lunleer opportunities beginning in 
the next 3-12 months in Africa, 
Asia, Latin America, and the Pa-
cific. Our representatives will be 
pleased to provide you with details.

When I mUII!c.l 10 5..Hl Dlcgo Itve years ago. I Loulc.ln 'r hl'ip but gcr exured o\'er th,' 
Padre!>. In l<.Ict. each }'ear Ill}' ct1(hu~wsm has grown a little more . ttl where thiS sea~n 
I have lounc.l thar my devollon to my hometown GI,HltS IS blinded a bit. But each )'e,lr 
one thing Ius alwa),s kept mc lrolll convening. 1'<.Ic.lre announcer Jen) Colem,m. ,

ct1(c nalning. Coleman's SIc.lCkICk o,\\'c Campbell I ~ a glant snore out at least he ,.lilows 
me to catch up on some slcep. Lolcman is nauseating. No buts about It. 

But why should I allow my leeh ngs toward a ballclub hI! dcterminec.l by an 
announcer? Because I let Coleman get to me. Afrer working for a team lor awhile. a 
certall1 attachment IS to be expected . Jeny Coleman IS sraplcc.l , glueu . nailed and 
welc.led to the Padres HIS bla~ is ove rwhelmll1g Narurally. a baseball organization 
would prefer ItS announcers to seem OpllmlStlC, but Jerry Coleman really bcltcves thc 
P,ldrcs Will go undefeated the rest 01 the season . He depicts the players a~ celestial 
creatures ,md the team itscll as l'tr(uaJl)' infallthle Whenel'er I hrsr tune 111 ro a Pac.lre 
game, I'm ,III for 'Col, but alrer an inning or so of Coleman, my mood changes 
complt:lely. Colem,Hl has rhc Pads so high In the sky th,t[ I hilt) myself yearntng for 
their crash 

And hC51c.les that. he sti n ks. 
Allow me to pick on the gU)' some. 11 you're a P,lure fan. or worse }'et, a Coleman fan 

- don 't reac.l on. 
FrIday Illght the Padres were m Los Angeles to baule the Dodgers, and KCST-TV 39 

was there. Jerry Coleman and Dave Campoell were rhe announcers. Here are some 
excerpts. 

In thc LOp of the lirst mning, Padre leadofl bauer lUI~ Salazar SWlI1gs at a pitch In 
the dirt to strike out. Coleman: "lius, if YOLI /mow, has a tcneicllcy to sWing at bad pltclll:S ... 
(Coleman IS telhng the truth but soon realizes hc is also admitting a fault of alazar, 
and qUickly balls out 01 It) .. 011 the otllLT halld, 5<lia;:ar SIVlI1gS at pitches out oj the stnkr 
::(1)(: jar JICCse hits." The bottom Ime IS thar alazar sulfers from a lack of patience at the 
plate. ole man is alraid to say It. 

In the bottOm of the first. Dodger second baseman Stcvc ax hits a routme lIy ball to 
Tony Gwynn m rightlield , who miSjudge It and bare ly make the catch. Coleman: "Boy 
he elld a good cllde Job to wllal that Ollc!" GWYlln wouldn 't have had to make a ·clrcle 
job" at all If he hadn't misplayed It. Coleman doesn't mention dUL 

"Deep fly to left ... Jones going back to the wall, .. 
he slams his head into the fence! .. , it's rolling back 
towards second base! " - Jerry Coleman 

In the bottom of rhe second. Greg Brock approaches the plate as Coleman gtves us a 
bit of nosralgla: "Brock lilt om' ol'a thc (clltelfidei wall last rught oJJ of .. (ten- econd 
pause) ... Siel Monge. I hllew I 'el thll1k of It SlIllC he hit It way ol'er the JCtlLl'." (How long 
would we have had to walt If he barely cleared rhe wall?) Brock line!> a Single to left. 
Carmela Martinez overruns \[ lor an error, anc.l Brock advances to second base on the 
mtscue. On the Videotape replay, Coleman descnbes the play: "WhCil a great badl-up Job 
by McRt:yllolds £0 hl'cp Brach at sCLO lld!" 0 mention is made of Carrnc.lo's error. 

Coleman picks it up in the bottom of the second: "0- 1 pltcit to W/lItjidd - foulcd 
away, stn/le cwo, alld boyl Show has some good stu.D wllight. " Coleman praises rhe Padre 
pitcher for a pitch fouled off. One pitch later, Whitfield crushes a fastball over the 
centerfield fence for a 420-(00t home run. Yeah Jer - mce stuff. 

After two innings of sillelly garbage. KCST-TV spares us as Dave Campbell takes over 
the play-by-play. Unfortunately, Coleman doesn't leave . the booth . Campbell mentions 
that the Padres haven't scored a run in the last 17 tnntngs. and Coleman tntelJects. 
"You won't hold tltem dOWIi jorCl'cr, joills - 1 can gliaralHcc ya Owc!" Forever? As in the 
rest of their lives? Gosh, how bold. Jerry! 

I had to get away from the set to catch my brcJrh, choke, gag and catch my breath 
again. 

We resume tn the bottom of the fifth with Campbell still handling the call. Deleon 
hangs a curveba ll , and Brock promptly bangs It into center for a base hit Coleman: "So 
Fernando itang~ It lip there (Illd Brock jumps on ll." What? Did the Dodgers trade 
Valenzuela to the Padres In the LOp 01 the lilth? 

In the bottom of the seventh, Coleman takes over, and It really gets Sickening. 
Deleon rhrows a strike to Brock, and Coleman gets all eXCIled. "I tell Y" what... itc 's 
struggled a biC but it's evrdent titat LLm ltas filwiry JOlmd hiS rhythm!" Brock shuts Coleman 
up by slamming a rocket over rhe rightficld wall . Mike Marshall ropes rhe. next p itch 
down the leftfield hne for a c.loublc. After an Intentional walk and a saCrifice bunt , 
Deleon's rhythm cont inues. Sax hncs a shm to fight to drive In (WO more runs. rhen 
Whitfield slams one through the midc.lle for a basehlt. Nice rhythm , luis . icc analysis. 
Coleman. 

In the etghrh, after reciting scores around the rest of the league . Coleman gives our 
score: ..... Clnd hac ll'S the Dodger:; 8 alld chl' Padres 2 .. ic \ the Doc/gas 8-2 ... LA Icacls it 
/J} Sl.\ .... " Hey Jerry - what was that s ore again? "Dodgas 8, Paels 2 " 

On the post game show, Coleman has more rrouble with the scores: "Ill Scm 
FrcHlusLO, ClIlWlnati leads tlt e Pclc/"CS 3-2 III citt' li.xcil I II III Ilg ... Gee, San Diego must have 
caught a qutck [ltght north .
