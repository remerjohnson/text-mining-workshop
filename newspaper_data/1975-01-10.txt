Chile-UC Exchange Halted 

Ov~r Teacher Disappearance 
The controversial faculty 

exchange program between the 
Universities of California and 
Chile, opposed-- by faculty and 
student groups who believe it 
tacitly sanctions Chile's military 
junta, has been severed following 
the disappearance of a Chilean 
physics professor connected with 

. th41 program . 
The professor, Boris Chornik, 

who received his Ph.D. from 
Berkeley in 1971, disappeared 
from the University last month . 
Chornik's father says his son was 
picked up by the military police. 
Friends contend the professor is 
being held in a Santiago 
detention -camp in connection 
with the arrest of a friend of 
Chornik's who is accused of 
having machine guns in her 
possession . 

"A Threat" 
UCLA Chancellor Charle5 E. 

Young, who heads the UC policy 
committee that supervises the 
exchange, wired the University of 
Chile for information as to 
Chornik's whereabouts . 

Wrote Young: 'We believe this 
situation constitutes a threat to 
(the) continued ability to obtain 
and maintain well -qualified 
professionals with the University 
of Chile." 

Young said in the wire that the 
program would be suspended if 
his queries were not answered by 
last Monday. They were not. 

The exchange between the two 
campuses of students has not so 
far been affected by the 
suspension . However, there are 
i nd ication s that the student 
program may be stopped because 
of reported attempts by the 
Chilean government to recall a 
tudent current enrolled at on£> 

Barriers Constructed to 
Protect Del Mar Homes 

A 'berm' along Del Mar Beach 
by Mike McMahon 

A beach hound out for a jo~ on Del Mar' s beaches might be 
surprised to find the many extravagant ocean front homes partially 
hidden behind mounds of sand. The barrier, extending from 17th to 
29th Streets, is an example of coordinated foresight on· the part of 
the city and beach front property owners . 

Damage Threat 
During the winter months, stormy seas and high tides combine to 

pose a threat of extensive damage to many of the ocean front 
residences , Although most of the homes are already built up from 
the sand level, many with protective sea walls, the city and 
homeowners have teamed up to provide further preventive 
maintenance. 

Having acquired the proper permits from the Coastal Com-
mission , the Army Corps of Engineers, and the lands. Commission, 
the city in mid-November hired several bulldozers to construct the 
sand wall (known as a 'berm') . In a couple of days, the 8 to 12 ft . 
barrier extended the length of the beach . 

An inq·uiry by the Triton Times as to the cost and funding of the 
service was answered by Wally Beron' in the Del Mar planning 

The city of Del Mar, with rights to the beach property on 
endinlls, hired the equipment and operators to protect its own 

Inn""",,",,, and provid~ the service to other property owners at a 
of S1 .15 per frontage foot. The averaae lot runs anywhere from 

to 50 feet . 
Students enjoyina rentals on the beach were pleased to find their 

landlords pickina up the tab. Reportedly, most owners are pleased 
the service and there are few complaints. 

; Because of water and beachaoer erosion, the berm will be worn 
in time for summer. 

hastened to add that the winter preventIve measure was a 
ItPl"n".,,':I1,., one. Apparently, the city is losing sand yearly and a 

storm could overwhelm the barrier and cause serious

of UC's Southern California 
campuses. According to Young, 
when the student requested a 
postponement, he was charged 
with failing to return to Chile to 
resume his academic duties at the 
University of Chile. Later, two 
Chi lean military i ntell igence 
officers visited the student's dean 
and said the student had made 
defamatory statements about the 
Chilean government. 

The student is still in California, 
and negotiations are underway 
between the two schools . 

It is noted that Chilean in-
structors currently enrolled in UC 
programs will be allowed to 
obtain their degrees before 
returning hom e . There are 
presently no UC professors in 
Chile. One was due to leave 
today, but his trip has been 
cancelled as a result of the 
suspension . 

Revelle GE 
Program 

Challenged 
by Rich Yep 

A group of Revelle students 
who oppose the traditional 
' renaissance' program of UC San 
Diego's oldest college has formed 
to draft and propose new general 
education requirements. 

"Our aim is to establish a truly 
well -rounded curriculum , At 
present there are six or s~ven 
humanities requirements, and a 
language proficiency require-
ment, " commented Charyn Segal, 
one of the leaders of the Students' 
Committee for the Evaluation of 
Revelle Requirements (SCERR) . 
"You learn Shakespeare and 
Homer in Humanities , but you 
don't know what the hell is going 
on in the world ." 

Direct Meaning 

StERR doesn't think that the 
requirements should be as stiff as 
they are now and feels the 
electives offered should have 
direct meaning to students' lives . 

One of the ideas suggested by 
SCERR is to establish the Global 
Ecology class as a replacement or 
alternative to the thr~uarter 
social science sequence. 

Taught by Political Science 
professor Dennis Piraaes last 
quarter, Clobal Ecolo8Y dealt 
with the ecological problems that 
face the world in the future and 
the political implications at the 
present. 
"When bill companies spill 
mercury into a I.ke or river, they 
don't even think that the 
m icroorllan isms in the water 
miaht form a combination that 
eventually kills fish, " Seaal said: 
"Corporations don't think of what 
will happen when they sell DDT 
to the public." 

Continued on 'ap .. 

An alliance W ednesday between UCSD community members 
and the Navy coupled with San Diego city procedures helped 
defeat developer Ernest Hahn 's proposal to turn 106 acres near 
campus into the University Town Center. 

Arguments by opponents of the Center convinced three San 
Diego planning commissioners to vote against the Center. 
Although affirmative votes were cast by three members , the city 
charter rules that a tie goes against the applicant . 

Hahn, representing University Wolfsheimer voted in favor . 
Town Center Associates, sought Morality 
permission for the development Their decisions were made 
of land on the southeast quadrant r UCSD student Marco 

Developer Ernest Hahn 
of La Jolla Village Drive and 
Genessee Ave. 

The development would have 
included 300 housing units, 60 
shops, two major department 
stores, a social-community 
center, and parking for 3500 cars . 

The UCSD administration , 
represented at Wed nesday 's 
meeting .by Vice-Chancellor for 

Un iversity ifford 
. Grobstein , supported the 
proposal. The administration 
believed the proposed center 
would meet the dream of a 
community oriented town center 
near the campus, with major use 
by the campus community. 

The city planning staff also 
supported the plan . 

Hahn is expected to appeal the 
planning commission vote before 
the city council. 

Hahn, backed by several 
consultants, described the center 
to the commission through the 
use!Jf s.lides. The proposal made 
Wednesday was a scaled-<iown 
version of the Hahn center passed 
by planners but rejected by the 
city council IllS year . 

The proposed center would 
have contained about half the 
commercial area of Fashion 
Valley. 

Commissioners Oelawie , 
Dahlin, and Floyd voted asainst 
the proposal , while Padilla, 
DeIPrincipe and Chairman 

LiMandri implored the com-
missioners to consider moral it In 
making up their minds on the 
center. 

UCSD psychology professor 
Don fv10ss argued that the cent r 
would be built in a high cra h 
probability area , resultin g from 
Nav jets flying over the center 

Moss allp.ged that avy pilots 

ssor Don Moss 
consistently fly the jets outside 
the take-off corridor because of 
their " Iack of profeSSional at-
titude." 

And Navy Captain John 
Franklin testified that there was 
no letup foreseen in the number 
of flights at Miramar in the future . 
Franklin also contested one of the 
city' s stipulations that the center 
be approved since the Navy 
would scl()n build a runway to 
divert the air traffic over 
University City. 

Franklin said such a runway 
would ccst S150 million and 
would ptobably not be approved 
by Congress. 

The Environmental Impact 
Report (EIIi) prepared by the City 
was highly unfavorable to the 
pro/eet . I he report labeled the 
center a reaional f~ility, while 
the developer contended that it 
was a community faCIlity . 

Thto report considered the 
poSSIbility of. Navy jet crashing 
into the center as highly 
probablC' 



I 

s Not The Meat, 
ut The Motion 

The fabled University Towne Center went down to defeat yesterday, 
and unless the city council, considered by most to regard the center 
unfavorably, grants developer Ernest Hahn' s appeal, the great, modern 
radical conceptual delight in modern living will die a justifiable death . . 

For over three hours Wednesday the plan was debated before city 
planning commissioners. First came the Hahn slide show presented by 
an affably dressed architect, then the opposition in the persons of one 
UCSD student, one professor, and one Navy Captain. 

Perhaps it was the weight of the institutions these three people 
represented that convinced three commissioners to vote against the 
plan . But, after a whole summer of following the Ernest Hahn traveling 
side show complete with four or more consultants and lawyers all 
getting expenses for their half-attentive :istening in city council 
chambers, it was refreshing to see the monetarial overdog sent back to 
the drawing board by three dissimilar people. 

***. ** 
A planning commission meeting is the same whatever the 

California city. Ninety percent of the seats for the audience are usually 
vacant, the commission usually contains a token representation of the 
minorities currently in the process of c<K>ption, and the chairman 
usually has a banal wit stemming from his delight in the intricacies of 
Robert' s Rules of Order.

Letters 

Is Degree Worth the Paper? 
Developers take up most of the commission's time. A developer's 

entrance IS followed by a parade of consultants and lawyers under his 
tenure. Developers truly believe their schemes mean happiness for all -
that the paving, cutting, terracing of something such as a floraful 
canyon is balanced by the extra convenience of a Sears nearby. The 
measure of this conviction is proportional, I'm sure to their investment It is my understanding that the UCSD Faculty 
in the considered project. ' . Committee on Educational Policy has passed a 

regulation which prohibits students from gaining 
credit towards a B.A. from U.c. Extension courses, 
unless the course is taught by an instructor WlO is 
already hired as a regular faculty member at UCSO. 
The ostensible function of this rule is the preser-

This seJf serving regulation, administered without 
proper discrimination, is disreputable because it 
adds new streams of mistrust into an academic river 
already ' polluted by by-products of the 
bureacratization of the spirit. Also, it militates 
against the furtherance of putative goals, such as 
the intercourse between full time students and their 
civilian counterparts from the community, and the 
reduction of class sizes. Further, how can a policy 
which reduces the number of legitimate options for 
students to partake of be consistent with the oft 
heard rhetoric these days to expand the base of 
participation in the university? 

Testimony before commissions is orderly, well-mannered, the 
proponents followed by the opponents, who are constantly reminded 
by the chairman that they are speaking before a fact-finding agency in 

Wlich emotion only clouds the issue. Usually such considerations as 
the crash probability from a nearby airport, increase in air pollution, 
and lan.d rape are considered such emotional outbursts. 

Following all this factual testimony, the few people comprising the 
audience often sense an air of excitment as the commissioners discuss 
the issue to themselves through the PA system, one moves on the 
question, and each member in turn, hints at his vote on the motion. 

Then, the official vote comes, during which each member punches 
one button on the panel before him. For a moment, apprehension 
ant iCipat ing the final tabulation shoots through the audience, the 
developers, the opponents. The consultants do not fl inch, however -
they will be paid no matter what the outcome. 

Then the big board above the room lights up - each vote shining. 
Wednesday three green lights were matched by three red lights, so 
Hahn's super-duper development with fins, coughed to a stall.

Graduate students and Ph .D. candidates, for-

they were T.A.'s at 50 per cent FTE, are now being 
denied that privilege on the grounds of main-
tenance of quality control. It seems that graduates 
are capable of being teaching assistants for four 
years, or more, rut even after that time are deemed 
incompetant to conduct themselves a class which 
meets the high standards of instruction required by

by aher universities suspect, but so are, it seems, 
those granted by the alma mater to its own

Student Group Challenges 
Revelle GE Require·men"ts 

SCERR believes that 
Ecology is pert inent to 

Global 
today's 

world and essential for sc ience 
students. 

Segal sai( some of Revelle's 
facu lty and administration. in-
cluding Provost Friedk in, are 
sympathetic to the group's cause. 

Draft Meetings 
On Tuesd ly from i2 \.I .m. to 1 

p.m. and Wednesday from 11 
a.m. to 12 ~ •. r1l . SCERR will hold 
an organiza ional meet ing in the 
main confHehce room of the 
Student Certer. At the meet ings, 
the group plans to draft a 
proposal and submit it the 
following Thursday to Friedkin. 

Segal said Revelle's Academic 
Senate will have to vote on the 
proposals. Prior to th is vote, he 
said a discussion session between 
students and professors will take 
place. 

Continued from page 1 
In discussing the Humanities 

requirements, Segal. .l5aid , 
" Humanities professors 'feel 
confined to them. They're not 
free to do what they want." 

However. Associate Literature 
professor' David Crowne who 
teaches Human ities, insisted that 
he was not confined, but stret-
ched too thin . "The original 
r nnc-ept of t he Revelle 
curriculum was that after two 
years here, students would be 
prepared in different areas and 
could then choose a major 
equally prepared in all areas." 

Crowne went on to say that 
students are now choosing their 
major earlier, one of SCERR's 
objectives. 

"We feel that one problem with 
Revelle requirements is that there 
are too many Humanities to 
take," said Segal. "The ad-

Pase 4 Triton TiMes January 10, 1975 

ministration has overdeveloped 
its history and literature 
departments, and they don't 
know what to do with all the 
people." 

Positive 

When asked why she thought 
SCERR's plans would work, when 
others had failed in the past, 
Segal enthusiastically replied, " In 
the first place, we're starting off 
with something positive, not a 
destructive element . We want to 
add something, but not 
necess arily in addition to 
everything else." 

Segal announced, " I'm not 
going to stop trying for this 
program if the administration and 
faculty say no. I don't think we 
should. I think we've had to put 
up with these requirements long 
enough."
