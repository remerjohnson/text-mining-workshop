San Diego and UCSD police 
arrived at North Torrey Pines Road 
Monday night after witnesses report-
ed a stabbing at Black’s Beach involv-
ing two alleged gang members.

A fight broke out between two 

Latino males near the Black’s Beach 
Dumpsters between 9:30 p.m. and 10 
p.m., witnesses said.

After sustaining two knife 
wounds, the victim made his way 
up the cliffs to the edge of Eleanor 
Roosevelt College, where he flagged 
down a UCSD police officer just after 
10 p.m.

The second male was unharmed.
A witness at Asia Hall described 

the victim as a 20-year-old Latino 
male wearing a white shirt and plaid 
shorts, adding that the victim was 
conscious and breathing but refused 
medical attention.

He was taken to Scripps Memorial 
Hospital and subsequently released 
with non-life-threatening injuries.

SDPD officers had direct contact 
with both parties, but neither would 
cooperate with police questioning, 
and the victim did not wish to press 
charges, officials said.

This incident marks the second 
stabbing at Black’s in the past year. In 
July 2008, an unidentified victim was 
stabbed in the side after a late-night 
“drum circle” ended in a large brawl.

The fate of the Grove Caffe still hangs in 
the balance today, after Associated Students 
President Donna Bean contested the council’s 
vote to preserve the struggling enterprise at a 
meeting last night.

After nearly three hours of discussion, 15 
councilmembers voted in favor of ceasing 
Grove operations, while 11 voted for the cafe 
to remain open. The vote was taken under the 
presumption that a two-third majority was nec-
essary to approve the motion.

However, Bean contested the grounds upon 
which the two-thirds requirement was origini-

ally implemented. 
Council chair Jordan Taylor said that 

according to council bylaws, the fact that Grove 
employees’ paid positions were at stake neces-
sitated the two-thirds rule. Bean countered this 
by saying that because only a simple majority is 
required to create an A.S. enterprise, the vote to 
cease cafe operations should have been subject 
to the same rules.

The dispute will now go before the A.S. 
Judicial Board, a body composed of seven non-
council students appointed by the president. 
The board will hear both sides of the argument 
and determine a ruling by majority vote. 

The controversy over the council’s vote last 
night was prefaced by an animated discussion 
of the merits of allowing the Grove to remain 
open. 

Councilmembers on both sides of the debate 
expressed concern over the cafe’s value to the 
campus community, the recent failure of the 
Grove as a profitable enterprise and the mon-
etary commitment that would be necessary to 
revive the business. 

University Centers Business Officer John 
Hughes told councilmembers that updating the 
Grove to modern operating standards would 
likely run in excess of $350,000. Many on the 
council were unwilling to commit this type 
of funding to the Grove, which is roughly 
$126,000 in debt. 

“The influx of money that would be needed 
to salvage the Grove is not an appropriate use of 
funds,” Revelle College Senator Katie Hall said.

Still, others see hope for the cafe. Some 
councilmembers referred to the coming closure 
of Sierra Summit and El Mercado, stating that 
the Grove could easily fill the vacuum left by 
these eateries, seizing upon the opportunity to 
develop an expanded customer base.

“The fact of the matter is that once people 
come to the Grove, they come back,” student 
manager Frank Thomas said. “The hardest part 
is getting them to come in the first time.”

Vice President of Finance and Resources 
Naasir Lakahni is confident that the Grove 

A.S. president contests vote 
to maintain cafe operations, 
claims simple majority should 
have been required to approve  
Grove’s closure.

The annual Muirstock festival 
may be noticeably scaled back next 
year after a John Muir College stu-
dent fee referendum on the 2009 
Associated Students election ballot 
failed to gain approval, leaving the 
council short on funds.

Designed to provide the Muir 
College Council with funding to 
support Muir’s student organiza-
tions and various tradition events 
— including Muirstock and Muir 
Musical — the referendum would 
have raised the Muir College 
Activity Fee to $10 from the exist-
ing $7. 

The increase was rejected by a 
margin of 89 votes. 

Over the last several years, the 
A.S. Council has gradually cut 
funding for college councils, leaving 
them to seek out alternative sources 
of cash. 

The Sixth College Council ran 
an activity fee referendum in the 
recent election that passed success-
fully. Last year, Earl Warren College 
students also voted to approve a 

similar  referendum.
Muir College Council Vice Chair 

Abbas Hussain said the additional 
fees would have been key in facili-
tating the enhancement of annu-
al programs and events put on by 
Muir’s many student organizations.

“We named it the Giving Fee 
because it was a fee students were 
paying to give back to themselves in 
the form of a better college experi-
ence,” Hussain said.

According to Muir College coun-
cilmembers, the college’s annual 
events may have to be scaled back 
next year, and student organizations 
will likely see an across-the-board
cut in funding. Councilmembers 
said fewer bands may appear at next 
year’s Muirstock festival to compen-
sate for the lack of funds. 

This year, councilmembers were 
forced to draw $10,500 from their

reserve fund of $18,485 to support 
the cost of Muirstock. The festival 
typically costs the council upwards 
of $20,000. 

“If the referendum passed, then 
MCC could have used that addi-
tional money to support Muir orga-
nizations instead of tapping into 
our reserve,” Muir College Council 
Environmental Advocate Martin 
Kwok said.

Muir College Dean of Student 
Affairs Patricia Mahaffey said the 
council will not have as much dis-
cretionary money to support stu-
dent organizations next year. 

Muir College freshman Joe 
Hua said he saw no need for a fee 
increase.

“I didn’t know how I or my peers 
would benefit from paying more 
tuition than we already do,” he said. 
“It seems like we are already paying 
a lot for activities, and if Muir is able 
to put on activities now, I didn’t see 

how the fee increase would prevent 
them from happening in the future.”

But Muir College freshman 
Monica Chen said she saw the ref-
erendum as a way to enhance Muir 
activities.

“The Giving Fee seemed like a 
great way to help out the different 
clubs and organizations in Muir,” 
she said. “They’ve always put on 
fun events like Muirstock and Muir 
Musical, and I figured, ‘Why not 
pay a little more to make them even 
more eventful?’”

MCC freshman representative 
Frank Chang said he would support 
another referendum in the upcom-
ing Fall Quarter, an option that 
the council is considering. However, 
this would require a special elec-
tion, which would cost the council 
around $3,000.

Next year’s newly elected MCC 
members will convene next week to 
discuss their operating budget for 
the 2009-10 academic year. They 

plan to review the expenses of stu-
dent organizations for the following 
school year with the Muir Funding 
Advisory Board, and based on their 
financial needs, will decide whether 
to run another referendum. 

At a recent meeting, the council 
addressed the need to downscale on 
big-ticket events such as Muirstock,
Muir Musical and Burnout,  but 
decided that it will do everything 
it can to not abandon these events 
altogether.

“I feel that over the past few 
years, organizations have not been 
getting the funding they have asked 
for, and due to this, we have seen 
students use a lot of creativity and 
ingenuity to make events happen 
and be successful,” Hussain said. 
“But at the end of the day this can 
only go so far, and it will be noticed 
next year.”

can succeed as a profitable enter-
prise once the burden of nonstudent 
manager Cleveland Thomas’ $50,000 
annual salary is removed. Thomas’ 
departure would also mean the cafe 
would close during the summer 
months, saving it thousands of dol-
lars in operating costs. 

Lakhani presented financial 
projections demonstrating that the 
Grove would have reported a sub-
stantial profit this year had these 
measures been adopted earlier.

“If we had made these changes a 
year ago, we would’ve seen $12,000 in 
profit from the Grove,” Lakhani said.

Hughes echoed Lakhani’s senti-
ment.

“One of the things that’s very clear 
is that the Grove’s business model 
right now is not financially viable,” he 
said. “A large part of that is the non-
student manager getting paid a salary 
12 months out of the year.”

Despite these projections, many on 
the council worry that the Grove will 
fail to see any significant profit and 
will continue to drain student funds.

“The Grove’s model is no longer 
viable in that space,” Associate Vice 
President of Academic Affairs Lana 
Blank said. “Pretty much everything 
it does is also available nearby. … 
No matter how much money you put 
into it, it’s not going to turn around.”

However, Frank, along with fel-
low student manager Autumn Hays, 

believes the Grove will see a boost 
in profits once the cafe adopts a 
new business model designed to 
cater to upperclassmen, graduate stu-
dents and staff. They plan to shift 
the Grove’s emphasis from espresso 
to food, including hot sandwiches 
and pizza. 

Frank also said he would like to 
see greater communication from 
councilmembers regarding the cafe’s 
financial performance and daily 
operations, in addition to more 
council support in organizing events 
designed to attract business to the 
Student Center.

Big topics were discussed at last night’s meeting, though the future the Grove Caffe was a 
huge source of contention in particu-
lar, a question that was not satisfac-
torily put to rest despite some three 
hours of discussion.

The council perused through other 
legislation, including a Resolution 
Against the Usage of Registration Fees 
to Offset State Budget Deficiencies, 
which was passed unanimously after 
making minor adjustments to its lan-
guage.

Associate Vice President of 
Programming Garrett Berg mod-
eled one of the 
eight attractive 
Sun God T-shirt 
designs and told 
the council that 
Sun God mer-
chandise would 
be on sale next 
Monday. This 
year’s Sun God line includes the afore-
mentioned T-shirts, booty shorts and 
sustainable water bottles — which 
goes along with the green-oriented 
Bring Your Own Bottle campaign.  

He added that this year the 
Programming Office and Alumni 
Association have teamed up to offer 
discounted tickets for alumni for the 
first time: $5 off for general alumni, 
$10 off for Alumni Association mem-
bers and $15 off for Lifetime member 
alumni.

Berg also gleefully announced that 
Chilean actor and comedian Horatio 
Sanz would headline the comedy act 
for the festival.

John Condello, the A.S. repre-
sentative from the nonaffiliate speech 
policy committee, gave his two cents 
on the current draft of the policy, 
which he regards as extremely restric-
tive. He expressed his disdain for free 
speech zones and recommended that 

the A.S. Council not let the policy pass 
as it currently stands.

The next two and a half hours or 
so were spent discussing the fate of the 
Grove Caffe. Grove manager Thomas 
Frank actively and passionately insert-
ed himself into the discourse to defend 
the cafe against the flurry of attacks 
made against its current financil situa-
tion and business model.

John Hughes, the business officer 
of Student Life, offered some back-
ground on the failing enterprise as 
well as critiques of the council.

“A.S. beats the drum of owner-
ship,” Hughes said. “One of things in 

A.S. is that A.S. 
isn’t very good at 
it. We don’t own 
things very well.”

A travel fund-
ing request from 
the Koala for $400 
to attend Second 
United Comedy 

Knowledge Organizational Field 
Forum (S.U.C.K.O.F.F.) was ques-
tioned since the event can be found 
nowhere online.

Vice President of External Affairs 
Lisa Chen was so infuriated by the 
discussion that she passionately 
stomped out of the forum, banging 
the side door as she exited before 
quietly returning to her seat 30 sec-
onds later.

Other councilmembers found it 
silly to scrutinize the funding request 
when the finance committee had 
already approved the item, but the 
decision was nevertheless tabled for 
a week so that the council can inves-
tigate whether or not the event truly 
exists.

Finally, the council approved lan-
guage for the Student Organization 
Funding Advisory Board to finally 
complete the new student organiza-
tion funding process.

As the state budget crisis con-tinues flapping its venge-ful wings and public sec-
tors from every corner of California 
brace for the inevitable impacts to 
services that result from funding cuts, 
UC administrators have responded in 
various ways: increasing student fees, 
suspending services, freezing execu-
tive pay, reshuffling administrative 
departments and even decreasing the 
number of students admitted to the 
10-campus system.

At UCSD, however, the Student 
Affairs Office has indicated it will go 
one sketchy step further, combating the 
state’s financial neglect with a proposal 
to lasso a portion of student registra-
tion fees — meant to support services 
such as Student Health, Counseling 
and Psychological Services, the Career 
Services Center and the University 
Events Office, to name a few — and 
redistribute the money to academic 
components such as admissions, main-
taining class availability, staff salaries 
and inflation adjustments.

But considering that registration 
fees are meant to be used to support 
student services that are complementa-
ry to the university’s academic mission 
(the UC Board of Regents separated 
the registration and educational fees 
in the 1970s for that specific purpose), 
the plan will only serve to harm stu-
dents — yet another shocking insult 
to the very group the university is sup-
posed to be serving.

The most disconcerting aspect of 
UCSD’s plan to funnel registration 
fees away from student services is the 
fact that nobody knows about it. The 
A.S. Council passed a resolution last 
night calling for university transpar-
ency, but let’s face it — resolutions 
go a whole lot of nowhere. The UC 
Planning and Budget Manual specifi-

cally states that “the use of university 
registration fee income be limited to 
support of student services and facili-
ties” and “current university policy 
requires that the university registra-
tion fee … be the primary funding 
source for certain student services 
concerned with student well-being 
and not related to instructional pro-
grams.” Administrators are in essence 
breaking their own policy, and they’re 
going about it in the most shady way 
possible.

Although university operations 
have taken a hit with reductions in 
state funding, the registration fee is 
static: It’s a fixed fee that does not 
fluctuate because every student who 
attends the university must pay it. 
Registration fees were increased by 10 
percent last year in response to student 
concerns that essential services such as 
mental-health support lacked funding.

It’s preposterous the university is 

now slipping those funds away from 
us, without making it a public move. 
If the university needed money for 
academic departments, that concern 
should have been raised through an 
alteration of educational fees, not by 
taking away our registration fees now; 
more importantly, students should be 
notified through e-mail, newsletter or 
TritonLink that this is even an issue.

The Registration Fee Advisory 
Committee — including many student 
representatives — is in the process of 
reviewing all services funded by reg-
istration fees, and is accounting for a 
possible cut of up to 15 percent. The 
final determination will be made in 
summer, when the university’s operat-
ing budget is finalized. RFAC is also 
debating whether to rank services or 
implement an across-the-board cut. 

The committee will hold a pub-
lic forum at a yet-to-be-determined 
date later this quarter to gauge stu-

dent concerns. It’s essential that stu-
dents come to this forum to demand 
that administrators leave our reg-
istration-fee-funded services intact. 
Otherwise, a dangerous precedent 
will be set, and student services will 
continue to diminish.

NATIONAL NEWS — April is 
Financial Literacy Month, accord-
ing to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, 
but a new study suggests that col-
lege students are financially illiterate 
— prompting the need for schools 
to educate their students on finance 
fundamentals and debt management.

According to a report released by 
college financing company Sallie Mae, 
the average college student’s credit-
card debt in 2008 was estimated at 
$3,173 — 46 percent more than in 
2004 and nearly $1,000 more than 
when the company began collecting 
such data in 1998. There isn’t a trend 
in improvement either — graduating 
seniors were shown to be even fur-
ther in debt with an average balance 
of $4,100. Of the 1,200 undergradu-
ates surveyed, 60 percent said they 
were unaware of their high credit-
card debts, and 40 percent knowingly 
charged items to their cards despite 
being unable to pay.

Unsurprisingly, this increase in stu-
dent debt coincides with another trend: 
the rising cost of school. According to 
the College Board, the average tuition 
cost and fees of public four-year uni-
versities in the United States have risen 
50 percent in the past decade to $6,585 
a year, prompting more students to 

charge their educational expenses on 
credit cards. The Sallie Mae study con-
cluded that students charged an aver-
age of $2,200 in educational expenses 
on credit cards alone.

It’s an alarming trend, and in the 
wake of a credit crunch that has made 
investors hesitant to back private stu-
dent loans, many students have turned 
to credit cards, which are more acces-
sible, as a last resort.

College students are an ideal demo-
graphic for credit-card companies to 
target — without credit histories or 
adequate understanding of credit 
and debt, many students are given a 
smooth introduction into the world 
of personal finance and responsibility 
with enticing low-interest teaser offers, 
only to find themselves stuck trying to 
pay off enormous debts with interest 
rates much higher than they expected.

Some credit-card contracts also 
contain hidden language such as uni-
versal default clauses, which change 
the terms of the contract if customers 
forgo payments with other lenders. 
Students who don’t read their con-
tracts’ fine print can often spiral into 
large amounts of debt and quickly 
and severely damage their credit for 
defaulting on something as minor as a 
monthly utility bill. This in turn makes 
it increasingly difficult to obtain other 
types of loans, like student loans, as 
companies are reluctant to lend to 
those with bad credit.

With so many students digging 
their financial graves so early, many 
states have pushed to regulate the mar-
keting of credit cards on college cam-
puses in order to protect them from 
deceptive marketing practices.

Fortunately, California has taken 

such initiative with the passage of the 
College Student Credit Protection Act 
in 2007, which prohibits universities 
from giving material incentives to get 
students to sign up for credit cards. 

Prominent consumer advocacy 
groups have also taken a stand against 
the aggressive marketing of credit cards 
to college students on campus. Such 
efforts include a counter-marketing 
campaign by public advocacy group 
CalPIRG at UC Davis that distributes 
educational materials to students on 
campus about the dangers of credit 
and excess spending.

Still, the trend of increasing credit-
card usage and accumulation of debt 
among students is cause for concern. 
As a rule of thumb, a person shouldn’t 
have more than one credit card. 
Perhaps the most alarming statistic in 
the Sallie Mae study was that the aver-
age American college student carries 
4.6 credit cards, with over half of all 
students owning four credit cards or 
more — a strong indicator of overall 
mismanagement and, assuming that 
most students are not employed full-
time, a dangerous propensity for living 
well beyond their means.

Currently, the university does not 
accept credit-card payments on man-
datory student fees, such as tuition and 
dormitory housing, a commendable 
countermeasure against what could 
otherwise be an inclination among 
many students to rely on credit to 
cover such high costs. Still it’s evident 
that students are unaware of how their 
spending habits now could adversely 
affect them later.

Director of Student Business 
Services James Myers said the 
American adult and student popu-

lation does not know enough about 
credit-card debt and its consequences, 
and that a seminar or workshop on 
credit and debt education would help 
equip students with the knowledge to 
make better financial decisions. 

But in light of recent budget cuts, 
the university would be hard-pressed 
to offer such instruction through 
any of the administrative offices — 
a big commitment considering that 
it is operating with reduced staffing. 
Currently, Student Business Services 
offers tips on how to develop sensible 
spending habits and avoid the pitfalls 
of credit-card debt. But the message 
hasn’t gotten out to everyone yet. 

A good first step would be for 
the university to survey students, both 
incoming and current, on their knowl-
edge of personal financing as well as 
their spending habits — in the same 
vein as the e-CHUG online survey 
used to gather data on student alcohol 
and drug use. Based on these results, 
the university could gauge the neces-
sity and practicality of an educational 
program where students could develop 
a basic understanding of credit, debt 
and sensible spending habits. The uni-
versity is notorious for its opposition to 
student alcohol use and enforcement 
of its zero-tolerance policy, but the 
problem of rising student debt war-
rants far more concern. A course in 
financial management fundamentals 
would go a long way in helping stu-
dents develop financial security now 
and avoid years of debt later. Because, 
unlike alcohol, debt doesn’t leave the 
system — it only gets worse.

That bottle of Aquafina — yeah, that one — you’re paying way too much for it. There’s a more 
affordable and accessible alternative 
from your friend, the faucet.

After seeing the shocking number 
of empty bottles that my roommates 
were lugging over to recycle at Vons, 
I switched over from bottled water to 
tap. It just doesn’t make sense to drink 
from a bottle when you look at the 
environmental and monetary waste 

associated with doing so.
This Monday, during Earth Week’s 

Trash Sort, I went through three 
Dumpsters’ worth of garbage. By the 
end, there was a towering mound of 
recovered recyclable goods — the 
majority of them plastic water bottles. 
You don’t need to go through trash 
cans for plastic bottles, but everyone 
should do their part to recycle by being 
conscious of their waste. It would pre-
vent bottles from being sent to landfills 
and it would save me from awkward 
stares as I reach into trashcans to fish 
out plastic water bottles.

According to the Earth Policy 
Institute, last year the United States 
spent $15 billion on bottled water — 
the amount it would cost to provide 
clean drinking water to the entire 
world. Somehow we’ve gotten into the 
habit of paying good money for a 
product we’ve always had for much 
cheaper. Of course, we’re all victims to 
safety concerns and taste preferences 
— but never fear, there are alternatives.

For cash-strapped college students, 
the kitchen sink and water fountains 
are cost-effective solutions. If you were 
to purchase a 20-ounce bottle for a dol-
lar, you’d be paying nearly $6 per gal-
lon. You’d complain about gas prices at 
that level, but most people don’t think 
twice when the product in question is 
a bottle of drinking water. Yes, water 
is essential, but the bottle isn’t. About 
90 percent of the cost of bottled water 
is due to the bottle itself; bottled water 
can range from 1,000 and 10,000 times 
the cost of public tap water. The price 
of tap water in San Diego is $0.004 per 
gallon. Regardless of how much water 
you drink, switching from bottled to 
tap would save you a handful.

Some people drink bottled water 
for safety reasons, but tap water is 
actually tested more often and has 
higher regulations for contaminants 
than bottled water. Bottled-water com-
panies are not required to notify their 
customers if their water is contami-
nated, or, in most states, to tell their 
customers about their water’s origins 
or purification process. That means 
you very well could be drinking bot-
tled tap water. 

Taste is a big factor but that has to 
do with the filtration process. That’s 
why some bottled-water companies 
are just filtering tap water, bottling it 
and marking up its price to make a 
profit. In July 2007, Pepsi-Cola (the 
owner of Aquafina) revealed that it 
bottled tap water. Twenty-four percent 
of the bottled water we buy is tap water 
repackaged by Coke and Pepsi. Forty 
percent of bottled water is simply fil-
tered municipal water. You can do

this at home with a Brita pitcher or a 
faucet-filter adapter (they cost about 
$20 and will get you several hundred 
gallons of water).

Bottled water is convenient, but 
comes at a high price when you con-
sider the waste it generates. An equally 
convenient and reusable alternative is 
purchasing a stainless-steel bottle (why 
steel? Google BPA). You can fill it with 
filtered tap water at home and refill on 
the run at a water fountain. Typically, it 
wouldn’t cost you more than 30 or 40 
seconds to quench your thirst. 

The bookstore is currently giving 
out $5 vouchers for Klean Kanteen 

bottles when you bring in a plastic 
bottle to trade. You’ll make up the 
price of the bottle in no time and also 
reduce the number of plastic bottles 
that are produced. 

The Social and Environmental 
Sustainability Committee has been 
working toward expanding public 
water infrastructure (installing reus-
able water bottle friendly fountains 
and filtered fountains) and phasing 
out bottled water on campus. The 
Food Co-op took bottled water off its 
shelves and replaced it with free fil-
tered tap water for its customers. The 
A.S. Council has also taken a stance by 
passing a resolution in support of elim-

inating bottled water and encouraging 
the university to issue a campuswide 
policy to eliminate the purchase and 
sale of bottled water by June 2009. The 
UCSD Climate Action Plan aims to 
supply new water fountains and water 
distribution stations to reduce need for 
bottled water and obtain a commit-
ment from the administration to allow 
bottled water contracts to expire. 

Unless it’s an emergency, opt for the 
tap. If you can’t do that, please cut back. 
It would bring down the cost for water 
and reduce our greenhouse-gas emis-
sions, water consumption and waste 
generation. In the spirit of Earth Week, 
try it out. 

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lázaro 3,;;,9�;6�;/,�,+0;69
Dear Editor,

Walking across the UCSD campus 
each day are dozens of Armenian stu-
dents — students whose ethnic history 
pulses with an unforgettable incident of 
cultural persecution that remains pain-
fully relevant to them and to today’s 
anxious world: the Armenian geno-
cide of 1915, the Ottoman Empire’s 
destruction of more than 1 million 
Armenians, commemorated world-
wide every April 24. 

But how can an event that hap-
pened 94 years ago still be relevant 
with the other crises currently raging 
across the globe?

Quite easily.
The Ottoman government’s desire 

to “cleanse” minorities and create a 
Pan-Turkish state has been well 
documented. Records reveal that the 
Ottoman Empire was particularly 
intent on annihilating the Armenian 
race, which had become so successful 
within its country — a country with 
much territory previously belonging 
to ancient Armenia. The annihilation 
of the Armenian race would be the 
first genocide of the 20th century, one 
that Adolf Hitler studied in prepara-
tion for his own Holocaust years later.

Government archives in Turkey 
and around the world have proof of 
these goals. Yet Turkey still denies an 
Armenian genocide ever occurred, 
and many countries still side with 
Turkey when it claims that the deaths 
of a million Armenians were merely 
the result of a variety of World War I 
skirmishes and Armenian insurgencies 
impossible to pin on the government. 

Sound familiar? 
Acknowledging the Armenian 

genocide is still a key world priority 
as long as there is a Darfur, Rwanda, 
Kosovo or Cambodia, or any country 
imprisoning people for their beliefs — 
particularly students and scholars — or 

a terrorist group plotting to annihilate 
another race, nation or ideology. 

Most Armenian students on 
campus and within the wider local 
Armenian community hope that with 
a new president and vice president, 
both with longstanding records of sup-
port for Armenian issues, perhaps the 
tide will turn, the age-old avoidance 
of the truth will stop, and official leg-
islation acknowledging the Armenian 
genocide will be signed into law. 

However, between war and the 
economy, these are rather worrisome, 
distracting times and once again the 
State Department will likely use the 
current multiplatform war as its good 
old excuse to pressure the administra-
tion to bypass the Armenian geno-
cide issue altogether — as Turkish 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan
recently attempted to do in his first 
official dialogue with President Barack
Obama.

After all, the only remaining super-
power in the world is so darn power-
less in the Middle East unless it retains 
a strategic military base in Turkey, 
right? Surely the United States is ren-
dered useless without one. Our pow-
erful nation and military — with two 
world-war victories and many oth-
ers under its belt — couldn’t possibly 
innovate an alternative borne out of 
a bigger-picture integrity, could they?

Yes, they could.

A s a student living the meager col-lege lifestyle, I find it’s becoming increasingly difficult to actively 
pursue non-resume-filler extracur-
riculars. I understand that it’s a natural 
part of growing up, when immediate 
responsibilities overtake personal hob-
bies, and any notion of rebellion is a 
pointless diatribe against an otherwise 
inevitable fate. Even still, knowing this 
doesn’t make the transition any easier, 
and conformity has never been very 
exciting. 

To avoid segueing into a philo-
sophical discussion of our utter mor-
tal helplessness, I’ll get to the point: 
I’m now finding less and less time to 
absorb myself in the minutiae of video 
games.

In a culture that defines video-game 
enthusiasts as losers who waste their 
lives on the couch playing games for 
the mere love of it, I understand that 
admitting such a thing could belittle 
my credibility as a straight-faced gam-
ing authority. After all, why would you 
take me seriously if I couldn’t list the 
latest gaming trends, regardless of how 
little they interested me? I would be a 
fake, and the existence of this column 
would appear an act of bias. In light 
of such arguments, I suppose I could 
just as easily use my trump-all defense 
— “Go write your own damn column” 
— but instead, I’d like to get to the root 
of the question: What is gaming, and 
what constitutes a gamer?

Regardless of whether you’re aware 
of it, everyone plays a game of some 
sort every day. Obviously, none of us 
really define our ordinary activities 
as “games,” per se — but, really, when 
you’re confronted with an obstacle, 
a task, an enemy or whatever, and 
you’re forced to use some semblance 
of wit and intelligence to overcome it 
(or, more appropriately, “win it”), then 
you’re playing a game. By this defini-
tion, we’re all gamers stuck within the 
confines of the most expansive game in 
the world — life itself.  

Whoa. That’s deep.
Art has always been an attempt of 

sorts to comprehend the mysteries of 
life. But that’s obvious. I mean, aren’t 
we all, in various ways, trying to make 
sense of life? If science has always been 
man’s pursuit of logic, then art, as its 
antithesis, would naturally be the pur-
suit of sometimes-irrational expres-
sion. In this quest, however, man has 
constantly run up against the limits 
of creativity — his inability to surpass 
mimicry.

Struggling with creative limitations, 
however, has provided our society with 
some fascinating results — the best of 
which is, of course, the art of storytell-
ing. Narratives are embedded in the 
most subtle forms of all art, but story-
telling is the most critical in communi-
cating life’s complexities and nuances. 
From novels to comics to films to 
music, it’s all just an effort to tell a good 
story, and the most lauded attempts are

ROONEY Q uick — listen to all Rooney’s songs. If not, come sunset, you’ll be denying yourself the kind of 
chest-cavity butterflies one only feels 
in those precious few cheap, beautiful 
boy-band moments life brings along. 

Plus, their entire cache of uber-catchy, boom-box-on-the-beach hooks can be devoured 
in a mere (ecstatic) hour and a half, over two tightly wound full-lengths that’ve already 
gathered a fair crowd of screaming 13-year-olds.

Can you imagine hearing “The Sweater Song” for the first time live, and not being 
able to sing along? Yeah — so get out your Walkman and Spongebob dance-party under-
wear, and get to “I’m Shakin’,” guaranteed to make you feel like the star of your very own 
high-school musical. On the big night, don’t forget to refill your free tub of popcorn right 
before they play “Popstars,” then throw the buttery mess all over the masses when Robert 
Schwartzman screams “Unsophisticated money machines!” like he’ll never warm up to 
Beverly Hills. Speaking of, he might be stuffing a few butt-white ankle socks in his mouth 
in the near future, and would be lucky to — I mean, it’s not like Rooney’s gooey Beach 
Boys imitations are gonna make it in the art circuit.

W hat to do for spare change in the shit-rich state of California when you’re just a free-wheelin’, fun-lovin’

and ride a chill swell here and there? Break out 
the trusty ol’ Taylor, of course, and woo stoned 
weekend passersby with your kiddie-surf life 
lessons until no campfire circle-spot remains. 
“Sun drenched and lovin it!” James winks out 
from his MySpace, going for Jack Johnson but 
washing up mercilessly Jesse McCartney. Pick 
up some free BBQ (veggie options!) at a nearby 
booth before passing out from over-radiation 
of good vibes.

E ven the Tenaya nerds retiring early Friday evening to prepare for a long weekend of midterm grindstone will get 
some pleasure out of 17-year-old Katie Costello’s 
unapologetic lisp. “Songbird, I don’t care if you’re 
an old kazoo/ Sing to me and I will sing to you,” 
she warbles girlishly on track two of her debut LP, 
a little too proud of her darling honk-strument 
reference considering she pulled a blatant Taylor 
Swift (slash Keane) on track one. Then again, 
don’t listen to me: iTunes reviewer k8r calls 
Kaleidoscope Machine “arguably one of the best

O K, so the Strokes is a stretch. But these restless Palm Desert rebels will die trying. They may only have one EP and possibly 
the gayest band name ever, but their delayed,

and a nasal Casablancas drone — could certainly 
give you Strokes-style bass pedals to the heart 
when muffled through the walls of the 52-foot 
inflatable obstacle course that’ll be killing the 
Muir lawn. “Hearts break in the corners of eyes” 
is sung in a round over “It’s all right, it’s OK, you 
can do what you want” on “Dark Room Cold

happens at little-boy sleepovers. But so what if 
they’ve still got some living to do — so do we.

I was first introduced to Muir College by my big sister, who graduated from UCSD in 1988. “Celebrating the independent spirit?” she said, 
pausing on my unofficial college-hunt tour to read 
the Muir mantra aloud. “I’d say more just celebrat-
ing, period.” Having lived as a jealous Warren 
prisoner for four torturous years, she made it clear 
there was only one college to choose from if I was 
in it for a good time.

This year’s Muirstock bands may have yet to 
find their independence from soundalikes on the 
college-radio top 40, but all in a row (beginning 
3 p.m.), they amount to the perfect party cover 
band: If you yell loud enough and thrash hard 
enough, they’ll almost sound like the real thing.
Plus, seeing as the Muir activity-fee referendum 
didn’t pass for next year, we’ll get even crappier 
bands than Rooney at Muirstock 2010 — so cel-
ebrate while you can.

something special in the little rascals: They 
opened a Long Beach show of his earlier

those that affect us emotionally. 
However, among this elite guild 

of storybooks, gaming is probably 
the most invigorating and forward-
thinking of its kind. While science 
and art are natural foes, video games 
have merged the two to create an 
entirely unique method of storytell-
ing — yin and yang, the techie and 
muse in perfect harmony!

Compared to existing arts, gam-
ing is admittedly in its infancy. 
Creators are constantly finding new 
ways to capitalize on its crack-pipe 
addicts, but as of yet, we’ve only seen 
the greenest of beginnings. 

But even in its earliest stages, the 
craft’s genius level of interactivity is 
undeniable. Other storytelling medi-
ums are limited to objectivity; we 
the audience can see the world, but 
we can never live in it. What makes 
video games so fascinating is that they 
allow us to become part of the art, to 
manipulate it, to own it. Video games 
tap into a new level of mimicry and 
response, both exciting and terrifying.

So if art has always mirrored real-
ity, and video games have simply 
allowed for deeper involvement in 
this imitation, what makes me any 
less of an authority than my immedi-
ate gaming brethren?  

To be honest, nothing. Video 
games are growing up, and none of 
us should be confined to labels of 
gaming or gamers. The question is 
not, “Will we ever stop playing?” but, 
“How can we play differently?” 

With games that transcend the 
conventional definition of video 
gaming — “Flower,” for instance, 
depicts the dreams of flowers sit-
ting on apartment windowsills — the 
possibilities seem limitless.

TALE OF TWO-STRING PRODIGY HITS ALL THE RIGHT NOTES

*6<9;,:@�6-�<50=,9:(3

By Sonia Minden
Hiatus Editor

S kim over its IMDb synopsis and “The Soloist” might read like sentimental Oscar fodder: L.A. Times columnist Steve 
Lopez (Robert Downey Jr.) is hunting for his 
next front-page piece when he meets home-
less schizophrenic Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie 
Foxx), who solemnly plays a two-stringed 
violin next to a gigantic statue of Beethoven. 

Ayers speaks in uncensored babble, wears 
a plastic Hawaiian lei over a sparkly sequined 
jacket and pushes a shopping cart over-
flowing with miscellaneous 
scraps and garbage bags. 
But his music — simple and 
resonant above the constant 
urban grind — is testament 
to the transient’s misunder-
stood sensitivity and pro-
found inner conflict, a time-
less grace. 

Yeah, it’s kind of lame 
on paper — but only at brief interludes does 
“Soloist” actually slip into the realm of red-
carpet sap. Whereas most “based on a true 
story” flicks take loose liberties to heighten 
drama — tossing characters in merely to 
provide comic relief or to fill gaps in the 
storyline — “Soloist” seems to adhere to an 
unpretty reality. It is not a film about a man’s 
revelation in his musical genius, or a finding a 
cure for mental illness that will bring him out 
of poverty; in fact, most of Lopez’s attempts 
to relieve Ayers’ ailments are frustratingly 
ineffective. 

We might guess that a beautiful donated 
cello will be the vagabond’s ultimate salvation 
— but he refuses to play it indoors, prefer-
ring instead the guttered, rat-infested streets. 
When Lopez gives his friend an opportunity 
to perform a recital for the public, we might 
guess that the Juilliard dropout’s prodigious 
brilliance will attract enough mass-media 

attention to deliver Ayers a professional 
career and stable lifestyle. Instead, he panics 
and runs offstage before his bow even hits 
the strings.

Director Joe Wright’s drama ultimately 
explores a common humanity between two 
unlikely companions, along with the deeply 
psychological underpinnings of homelessness. 
“Why did you drop out of school?” Lopez asks. 
Ayers shakes his head, his squinted, half-blind 
eyes darting back and forth. “I don’t know,” he 
replies. “It just didn’t work out.”

Their quiet exchange lets us in on the 
transient’s traumatic, life-consuming dis-

ease: nothing has ever just 
“worked out” for him. But as 
we hear the relentless scat-
tering of voices distracting 
Ayers’ thoughts — goading 
him, threatening him, con-
soling him — we hear, too, a 
sea of music, Ayers’ imagin-
ing of symphonic accompa-
niment to the low, sad bass 

of his cello. Through his eyes, we see the psy-
chedelic colors of synesthesia and flashback 
glimpses of an increasingly troubled past. 

While Foxx’s performance is as gripping and 
nuanced as in “Ray,” it’s no pity party. Scenes 
depicting squatters are nightmarish and border 
on grotesque, but they’re carefully juxtaposed 
by Ayers’ unassuming, almost childlike, nature. 
Lopez handles the grubby street chaos with 
a cool, appreciative understanding — never 
demeaning his subjects or shying an occassional 
sleepover on the sidewalk. 

By the climax, we’re so thoroughly root-
ing for the characters’ success — for Ayers 
to connect with the outside world and come 
to terms with his inner demons, for Lopez to 
write inspired pieces and overcome his own 
fears and misgivings — that we forgive the 
occasional waves of tearful orchestral melo-
drama in light of the cast’s absorbing relation-
ships and restrained, yet intimate, sincerity.

Jadakiss
■ The Last Kiss
DEF JAM

F ive years after The Kiss of Death, Jadakiss has risen from the underworld. (Remember No. 11 single “Put Ya Hands Up”? Didn’t think 
so.) The once-celebrated L.O.X. frontman has 
been re-upped as a member of the Roc-A-Fella 
team with the release of his third solo album, 
and while Jadakiss’ natural flow bleeds of his 
New York upbringing, cheap ringtone jingles 
plaster the production — resulting in a hodge-
podge of almost-singles.

Jadakiss tries to bridge the gap from street 
rap to club yawns, unsurprisingly tripping 
over his laces on the way. Disjointed throw-
aways “Who’s Real” — complete with the dull, 
third-grader-could-do-better hook, “If you’re 
real and you know it, clap your hands” — and 
“Rockin’ With the Best” only go skin-deep, not 
flashy enough to warrant the blatant material-
ism. 

A lengthy guest list crowds the lineup and 

amps the schizophrenia. While some draw 
crowds and deliver (Lil Wayne, Raekwon and 
Young Jeezy), many don’t transcend party-
crashing filler (Swizz Beatz, Mary J. Blige). 

The Last Kiss could have used some of its 
fat cut out, but at a hefty 18 tracks, there’s 
still enough vintage Jada to keep fans salivat-
ing. “Pain and Torture” sees the former Ruff 
Ryder rapping over a minimalist and jagged 
violin beat, spitting out street-smart, sharp-
witted rhymes: “Give it to whoever deserve the 
rounds/ Hollow tips, move organs and nerves 
around.” 

Staying true to his inner-city punk is Jada’s 
best bet at this point, but for such a starry 
resume (including former Biggie apprentice), 
this kiss ain’t much wetter than a loveless peck.

Vincent van Gogh suffered an ignoble 
death, dispossessed and paralyzed with 
debt. Despite modern admiration, his 
Parisian peers couldn’t have been more 
apathetic. Thankfully, things have changed 
since then — in “Van Gogh: Brush With 
Genius” (forgive the title), the post-
impressionist superstar is paid tribute with 
fanfare only IMAX could provide: Sunflowers 
and sun-flecked fields span both the 
French countryside and the Fleet Center’s 
staggering 72 foot screen. (EG)

Metric
■ Fantasies
LAST GANG

A bove all else, Fantasies is a tribute to Emily Haines’ larynx. Pure and clear, rising to a crescendo without faltering 
— effortlessly seductive and transcendent 
in one great breath — her spot-on vocals 
elevate Metric’s fourth installment from 
mellow-rock mediocrity to perfectly chis-
eled indie pop.

Haines wrings every last drop of emo-
tion out of simple sentiments that, under the 
wing of an inferior songstress, might have 
languished as meaningless. Seemingly trite 
on the album jacket, lyrics like “I tremble, 
they’re gonna eat me alive/ If I stumble, 
they’re gonna eat me alive/ Can you hear my 
heart beating like a hammer?” break through 
the electronic haze with sheer, primal power. 

Present only to save her from herself,  
Haines’ cracking beats recall ’80s new wave 
and polished, airwave-prepped production 

akin to Garbage or the Talking Heads. On 
“Satellite Mind,” drums and guitars fade 
ignominiously into the background, drown-
ing amid the synth waves that escalate 
Haine’s crystalline high notes.

 Thankfully, Metric avoids near over-sat-
uration on “Gold Guns Girls” and “Stadium 
Love.” Crashing drums and slick guitar riffs 
flesh out the Canadian rockers’ sparkly 
clean melodies, rocking the party a la 2007’s 
Grow Up and Blow Away. But everything 
on Fantasies swings full circle to its heart: 
Haine’s voice, which — even when wavering 
delicately — rises to a fist-pumping chorus 
big enough to stuff an amphitheater. 

Metric will perform live in San Diego on 
June 7 at Independence Jam.

Fastball
■ Little White Lies
MEGA FORCE

T rust me on this one: In about a year, you’ll hear Little White Lies in a feel-good Fox Searchlight teen dram-edy, and damn near nowhere else. Fifteen years after 
dropping surf-rock debut “The Way,” Fastball’s gone 
softer and sweeter than a pack of Peeps — and swallow-
ing all 12 tracks is just about as sickening as gorging on 
the entire Easter dozen. 

First, two young lovers lock eyes from across the 
room. As the determined buck desperately pushes 
through the crowd to reach her, Tony Scalzo sighs, “All I 
was looking for was you.” A bouncy, major-key harmony 
keeps us warm and fuzzy as they smooch for the first 
time. But like any romantic comedy, its make-out scenes 
are the only interesting parts, and acoustic guitars and 
fuzzed-out synths are layered into one big tuned-out 
soundtrack.

Just then, disaster strikes! Our hero stalks away, his 
tantrum backed by strings plucked with snarky twang, 
as “Little White Lies” convinces us that he’s better off 
without her: “I don’t miss you all that much/ Don’t miss 

your kiss, don’t miss your touch.” It’s here that Scalzo 
displays some much-craved restraint, matching crashing 
drums alongside the only chorus we’ll remember after 
the credits roll. 

Later, our hero shoves airport security aside and yells 
his lover’s name — with one foot on the plane, she turns, 
hesitates and runs back to him. A piano chirps out the 
melody of “Soul Radio”: “You and I, we scream, we cry ... 
Who knows why we’re here, we’re gone.” Into the sunset, 
organs swell and a kid runs his hand down the length 
of a keyboard — and, suddenly, the final kiss flips from 
triumphant to cheesy and overblown.

All the filler between scenes makes us wish for a 
remote control. But most are catchy enough — “Looking 
For” is a definite high point — that you’ll probably play 
them more than once, like it or not  (even if you have to 
sneak into the theater).

Prefuse 73
■ Everything She Touched Turned Ampexian
WARP

S cott Herren leaves no booklet, no acknowledge-ments and no liner notes to accompany his sixth and most official full-length LP. The Atlanta-based 
hip-hop producer forgoes the big-named cameos 
that littered his previous works, choosing instead to 
immerse us in the 29-track Everything She Touched 
Turned Ampexian with no preconceived notions, no 
judgments and without any clue of what the fuck we’re 
about to listen to.

But that’s the beauty of Ampexian — it’s a mind-body 
experience that takes us into the recesses of Herren’s reel-
ing dreams and nightmares, channeling laser-sharp emo-
tion into an unprecedented artist-audience correlation.

“Periodic Measurements of Infrequent Smiles” spins 
an introduction the length of a goldfish’s attention 
span. Glitchy speech samples mix with high-frequency, 
ambient-spaceship static, the white noise seamlessly 
slipping into a calm, harmonic chorus before ending up 
right back where it started — all in less than a minute, 
delivered in cracked-out, animated lurches. 

Herren follows this stream-of-consciousness groove 

to its bitter end, jumping from blip trip to serene ambi-
ence faster and more erratically than Dostoevsky’s 
Notes from the Underground, restlessly triggering dis-
embodied samples and shattered-glass techno.

Though he unapologetically pushes the boundaries 
of hip-hop further than fellow producers RJD2 and 
Madlib, Herren can still stick a dance-friendly hook 
in our heads — no matter how scratched or blurry 
the lines are. Melodic vibrations infect “Fountains of 
Spring,” resonating over a drum track coated in reverb 
and gravel, and what seems to be a troupe of Martians 
pushing lawnmowers. 

Careful contemplation and introspection polish off 
Herren’s technique-based tracks, which shine brighter 
than ever. But, as he intimates with the album title — 
Ampexian refers to the old-school Ampex tape decks of 
the 1950s — there’s still room for a little analog spark in 
all the dense digital smog.

Aztecs in check through the 
remainder of the game, playing even 
with them and even outscoring the 
Aztecs in the second quarter. Senior 
captain Sydney Gstettenbauer 
played well through the match, 
scoring four times to provide some 
hope that UCSD’s key performer 
will continue her strong play into 
conference finals this weekend. 
Despite the early deficit, the Tritons 
played well through the rest of the 
match, holding the Aztecs to seven 
runs — their first-quarter output — 
throughout the final three periods of 
the game.

“We’ve been playing together for 
a large part of the year, and we’re 
finally getting adjusted to each 
other,” Heinrich said. “We had a 
little more experience from the last 
time we played them.”

The Tritons also played Chapman 
on Friday and had their greatest 
offensive production of the season, 
using a balanced attack to defeat 
the Panthers by a whopping 20-8 
margin. 

Nine Tritons registered goals 
in the game and UCSD scored five 
goals in each quarter, dominating 
from start to finish, leading in the 
match against the Panthers from the 
get go.

“It was fun playing Chapman,” 
Heinrich said. “We got to run some 
stuff we only usually get to run in 
practice. We definitely got in a lot 
of good experience for conference 
championships.”

In the matchup, Gstettenbauer 
scored seven goals while Heinrich 
and junior attacker Audra Bloom 
had solid games as well, each 
recording hat tricks.

With the season winding down, 
the Tritons must now set their sights 
on the conference championships 
this weekend. The Tritons have a 
10-19 overall record and, as the No. 

4 seed, will face off against fifth-
seeded Sonoma State University in 
the first round of the Western Water 
Polo Association tournament.

“We’re just getting ready for 
conference,” head Coach Larry 
Sanders said. “We’re not worried 
about who we have to play, we just 
have to play our game.”

The Tritons will travel to Santa 

Clara for conference championships 
on Friday and will play through 
Sunday for seeding in the NCAA 
tournament. The winner of the 
WWPA tournament receives an 
automatic bid to the national 
tournament.

DeFazio’s single came during the 
second inning when the game was 
scoreless and senior first baseman 
Jenni Habib’s came during the seventh 
with the Tritons down 1-0.

UCSD bounced back and took the 
second game 5-0. The Triton offense 
looked strong in the victory, scoring 
five runs on 10 hits, including a lead-
off home run by sophomore outfielder 
Kristyn Lesovsky.

“We played very 
well as a team,” 
freshman pitcher 
Camille Gaito said. 
“I can’t wait to see 
Kris Lesovsky hit 
some more home 
runs.”

Gaito powered 
the Tritons with 
a phenomenal 
p e r f o r m a n c e , 
picking up her 
seventh win of the 
season in a complete 
game shutout. Gaito 
allowed only two 
Toro hits, and UCSD had a 2-0 lead 
going into the fifth inning.

Chastain added on to the Triton 
lead with an RBI single. Even with a 
4-0 lead, the Tritons continued to hit, 
loading the bases during the seventh 
inning. UCSD then scored its final 
run of the game when CSUDH issued 
a walk to sophomore catcher Nicole 
Monroe.

The Tritons fell short in the 
third game, losing 6-3. The Tritons 
had six hits in the game, but failed 
to produce with runners on base. 
UCSD left a total of seven runners 
stranded.

“Their pitcher came out strong,” 
Saari said. “We couldn’t string our 
hits together.”

With the score 6-2 in favor of 
CSUDH, Habib led off the sixth 
inning with a double, and would 
come around to score the final run for 
UCSD later in the inning, courtesy of 
a Toro error. The Tritons attempted a 
two-out rally in the final inning when 
sophomore infielder Sarah Woofter 
and Saari hit back-to-back singles, 
but the two never came across to 
score as the rally failed.

U C S D 
dominated the 
final game of the 
series, coming 
out on top with 
a 10-2 drubbing 
of CSUDH. Gaito 
notched the win for 
UCSD, her eighth 
of the season. Gaito 
tossed 4.2 innings 
while holding the 
Toros scoreless. 
Senior outfielder 
Allison May put 
the first runs on the 
scoreboard with a 
two-run single to 

right field. May finished the game 
with two hits. Saari had two hits and 
two RBI in the victory. The score was 
7-2 in favor of UCSD at the start of 
the seventh inning when Lesovsky 
officially sealed the victory for UCSD. 
Lesovsky hammered a three-run 
homer, adding to her team-high totals 
in home runs and RBIs this season. 
She has smashed eight homers and 
driven in 31 runs for the Tritons so far.

“We did well,” Monroe said. “Our 
pitchers did an outstanding job 
and our bats came alive too. I just 
hope we carry the same attitude and 
momentum to next weekend.”

SOFTBALL — UCSD was in desperate 
need of some victories coming into last 
week’s series against conference rival 
Cal State Dominguez Hills, having lost 
four of its last five games. Although the 
Tritons managed to get a couple wins, 
they had to settle for a split in their 
four-game road series.

After the series, UCSD (25-20, 
15-12 California Collegiate Athletic 

Association) is tied for fourth place 
in the conference. The Tritons will 
finish the season by playing a four-
game set at Cal State Monterey Bay 
this weekend. CSUMB (32-23-1, 18-
10 CCAA) is currently second place 
in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association. To qualify for the playoffs, 
UCSD must finish in the top four.

“Now the pressure is on against 
Monterey Bay this weekend,” junior 
catcher Nicole Saari said. “We need to 
get wins no matter what it takes.”

The first game against CSUDH was 
a pitchers’ duel; UCSD fell short 1-0. 
Senior pitcher Lauren Chastain tossed 
a solid game, giving up only six hits in 
six innings of work. Unfortunately for 
the Tritons, their offense was almost 
nonexistent. UCSD only mustered 
two hits — both singles — against the 
Toros. Sophomore infielder Jennifer 

SOFTBALL SETTLES FOR WEEKEND SPLIT

TRACK & FIELD — Even though 
she had to deal with Los Angeles heat 
and smog, Bre Schofield stepped up 
to the line ready to run. By the end 
of the long 1,500-meter race, she had 
the fastest women’s time in UCSD 
history.

“Conditions were pretty bad,” 
the sophomore said. “I was working 
on not focusing on it, telling myself 
it’s not hot. When you race, a lot 
of things come into your head. But 
when the gun goes off, I feel more in 
control.”

Competing in the Long Beach 
Invitational held at Cerritos College, 
the Triton track and field team sent 
a smaller squad in preparation for 
future races. But, the meet was not 
without highlights, and Schofield’s 
record-breaking performance was 
the most prominent. Schofield set 
the record with a time of 4:29.67, 
which is also an automatic NCAA 
qualifier.

“When I saw it was the fastest 
I’ve ever run the 1,500, I was really 
excited,” Schofield said. “Breaking 
4:30 has been my goal for the entire 
year. When I found out I broke the 
school record it just made it all the 
better.”

In the same race, senior Ashleigh 
Montgomory ran a time 4:40.42, 
good for ninth all-time in school 
history. Sophomore Deyna Roberson 
posted a time of 63.69 seconds in 
the 400-meter hurdles, also good 
for ninth all-time. In the 100-meter 

dash, senior Katie Skorupa won her 
heat with a time of 12.29 seconds, 
setting a personal record and moving 
her to fourth all-time. 

On the men’s side, junior Casey 
Ryan placed second in the high jump 
with a mark of 6’8.75”. Ryan also 
had a strong showing in the javelin 
throw, finishing 12th with a distance 
of 170 feet. 

Schofield was not alone in setting 
school records. Earlier in the week at 
the Azusa/Mt. San Antonio College 
Heptathlon, junior Linda Rainwater 

broke her own school record with 
a score of 5,140 points. Rainwater 
was last year’s California Collegiate 
Athletic Association champion in 
the heptathlon.

“A 5,000 point heptathlon for a 
college athlete is pretty exceptional, 
and she just keeps pouring it on,” 
head coach Tony Salerno said. 

Sophomore Stephanie LeFever 
also competed in the event, scoring 
4,829 points to earn an automatic 
NCAA bid. LeFever finished fourth 
in the conference last season. 

UCSD is entering the final 
stretch of its season, with the 
Triton Invitational on April 24 and 
conference championships a week 
after that.

“We have a very tough conference, 
one of the toughest in the nation 
in Division II,” Salerno said. “We 
have to be on the ball and maximize 
points wherever we can.” 

Schofield also emphasized the 
team aspect heading into conference 
championships.

“When you get into the 

championship phases, it’s about 
winning and getting points for 
your team and working together,” 
Schofield said. “We’ve won for 
the past four years and we have 
confidence that we can win again.”

The Tritons will be in action 
this weekend in their final home 
meet of the season, the Triton 
Invitational, before the conference 
championships.

WATER POLO — The Triton women 
ended their regular season against 
Chapman University on April 17 
and squared off against crosstown 
rival No. 7 San Diego State the next 
day in their final two games of the 
year before playoffs. UCSD laid a 
severe beat down on the Panthers 
of Chapman, but were overwhelmed 
by the Aztecs in the same weekend, 
entering the postseason after 
yielding mixed results in its final 
weekend.

The Tritons visited San Diego 
State to take on the team that had 
beaten them 16-6 earlier in the 
season at the UC Santa Barbara 
Invitational Tournament. 

The Tritons entered the annual 
Harper Cup looking for revenge and 
a chance to exonerate themselves 
from their earlier loss. As expected, 
the Aztecs stormed out to a quick 
lead. But the 7-1 deficit the Tritons 
were looking at after the first quarter 
was more than they anticipated.

“They came out strong,” junior 
hole set Stephanie Heinrich said. 
“We were expecting them to come 
out fast, and we just weren’t ready.”

UCSD managed to hold the
