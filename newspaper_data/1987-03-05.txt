Return to old 
meters approved 

Followi ng Vice Chancellor of 
Business Affairs Steven Relyeu's 
approval of the reinstatement of 
nickle , dime and quarter 
accepting parking meters, an 
order was placed yesterday for 
the parts needed for the 
conversion. 

Almost two weeks ago, the 
Parking and Transportation 
Alterna tives Advisory Committee 
voted to rerurn to the previous 
meter system, and advised Vice 
Chancellor Relyeu to do the 
same. 

In order for the meters to be 
converted , each meter must be 
taken out and replaced with 
multiple coinage accepti ng 
mechanisms. 

LaSt summer It took twO 
months to convert all of the 
meters to accept only quarters. 

The parts needed fo r the 
conversIOn are expected [Q arnve 
withm 30 [Q 45 days. 

College buildings 
deemed unsafe 

Many California COllege and 
university bUIld lOgs are unsafe in 
the event of an earthquake, a 
seismologist recently said. 

About one-tifth of the 1,300 
state owned buildings considered 
major strucrures are stucturally 
unsafe. Of these bUIldings, 75 to 
80 percent are on college 
campuses. 

According to the executive 
directOr of the :,tate Seismic 
Safety Commission Tom Tobin , 
2,000 students would die at 
UClA alone If a major 
earthquake occurred 10 Los 
Angeles

Riley discusses 
'State of Campus' 
in address 
By MATTHEW l.AIT, Nnvs Ed(tor 

Associated Students President john Riley discussed the 
imponancr of a "cohesive training program" for teaching 
assfstants, the possibility of a shuttle system next fall and the 
upcoming Sun God festival in his fourth "state of the campus" 
address last Tuesday on Revelle Plaza. 

Refenng to the Smelser Kepon, wh'ich made recommendations 
for improving undergraduate education, Riley said, "The quality of 
teaching assistants is the most important issue [of the reportl to the 
students ofUCSD." 

Problems with communication and class preparation were 
among the complaints aimed at teaching assistarns. 

"We [the ASUCSDJ are asking for a 'cohesive training program to 
adequately prepare TAs'" Riley said . Proficient command of both 
written and spoken English were among the reccnnmendations 
suggested by Riley. 

The funding for the training' programs should be acquired from 
the Regents , Riley sa id . 

Another issue which the student body president discussed in his 
address was parking. The AS is still attempting to pressure the 
administration into honori ng the Parking Advisory Committee's 
resolution by revening back to the nickle , dime, quarter meters. 

Riley pointed out that there are other problems with parking 
which is partially caused by the 45 percent oversell of permits 
compared to the 15 percent standard of other schools nationwide. 

"That (permit overselling) is just ridiculous. It puts pressure on 
everybody," Riley said . 

The parking committee is also looking into the possibility of 
building a commuter parking lot which would not reqUire a permit. 
In addition , the committee is trying to accelerate the shuttle 
system's operation for fall 1987. 

The last main topic Riley spoke about was the increased budget 
for the upcoming founh annual Sun God festival. The proposed 
budget is $26,000 larger than the previous $10,000 budgetof a year 
ago. 

Because of insurance and locatio n problems, the AS will be 
unable to fulfill its promise of furnishing rides at the festival. ''To 
make up for no rides, we are trying to book really good 
entertainment," Riley said. 

"We are taking steps to get something like UClA's mardigras or 
State's Spring Festival here ," he said. 

Other topiCS mentioned were the operdtion of Ti psy Taxi on 
Fridays and Saturdays and the upcoming TG, which will fearure the 
Uptones.

Shortly after the 12:00 am

By j.W. AKERS·SASSAMAN, Capital Correspondent 
SACRAMENTO, UC Wire - The 

construction of a proposed 
"world class research center that 
would attract California's top 
AlDS researchers, including many 
from the University of California, 
got the go-ahead yesterday. 

In a joint hearing yesterday, 
the Assembly Health Committee 
and the Senate Health and 
Welfare Committee unanimously · 
vOted to spend $1.5 million for 
the first phase of a multi-
disciplinary AIDS research 
center. The complete project, 
which has an estimated price tag 
of $10 million, will provide 
laboratory space for 50 
researchers and technicians. 

Although the 1986-87 state 
budget authorized the addition 

of two floors (0 San Franscisco 
General Hospital for the research 
center, financial "comrol 
language" in the budget required 
the two committees to publicly 
review the project. During the 
hearing yesterday, sc ientists and 
public health officials s trongly 
supponed the project, calling it 
essential to fight what one said 
was an "unprecedented problem 
(0 SOCiety." 

"The AIDS epidemic is one of 
the most terrifying medical 
events I've seen in my lifetime," 
said Lloyd Smith , a long-time 
physician and associate dean at 
UC San Francisco. 

Smith strongly supported the 
center's construction and 
promised that the university 

would establish "a firm 
partnership" with the hospital 
and the sta te (0 fight AIDS. 

If AIDS IS to be conquered, 
said UCSF Molecular Virology 
Professor Harold Varmus, 
scientists "need a sophisticated 
research environment LO where 
they can stud y the basics of the 
immune system." 

Such an understanding is 
essential to fighting AIDS, 
because scientists cannot 
overcome what they do not 
understand , Varmus said. 

The proposed center will 
prOVide the needed research 
environment. In addition, the 
center will more effectively utilize 
research dollars . he said , because 
scientists will be organ ized into 

"a coherent unit that will 
facilitate fruitful interaction and 
coordinated use of facili ties." 

The center would attract 
investigators from around the 
state , including many from the 
university , in fields ranging from 
virology to genetics , said UCSF 
professor Merle Sands. 

The center should achieve a 
"synergistic effect" by creating a 
"cri tical mass" of focused 
attention on the problem, he 
said. 

Dave Werdegar, director of 
Publ1c Health for the city and 
county of San Francisco, said the 
center would be "one of the 
world's [th ree I greatest research 
fadli ties on AIDS."

Notes from the Underground Matthew J. Cronin 
Pop go the weasels 

Since it is my behef that the supposedly 
omnipresent "silent majority" - whose wishful 
existence is always called up by those individuals who 
desire power but have no support base - cares very 
little for public affairs and has no real influence on 
public policy. 1 usually gage my analysis of where a 
community stands on a particular issue by the 
opinions of those who are vocally active on either 
Implementing or stifling change. Given the fact that 
UCSD does not have its own publicall)' broadcast 
television station equipped with a time slot for 
community response to the pertinent issues of the day. 
the printed media play the largest role in exhibiting 
public opinion. The Guardian. being the biggest and 
most Widely read newspaper produced at UCSD. can 
be said to be. and I think rather accurately, the leading 
indicator of UCSD community sentiment. Whether 
through its letters section or submitted commenta ries 
published in the opinions pages. or even via the 
informal discussion held each day on the articles 
printed in its news. features . sports and hiatus 
sections. this newspaper is a state-of-the-art window 
on the world of this univerSity. 

Being part of the Guardian for the past three years. I 
would venture to say that the members of the UCSD 
ommuniry who are most concerned about keeping thiS 

newspaper on its toes by contributing their 
perspectives as to what we should and should not be 
dong have most frequently berated us for the following 
reasons: 1) some members of the Left feel that our 
attempts at being obJecllve In our newsreportmg is 
incredibly naive. since no one can be truly objective; 
this enables the establishment to use our publication as 
a public relations handout; 2)some members of Right, 
sometimes JOined by moderates and liberals, have 
harrangued us for not giving equal space to 
conservative spokespeople In our opinions pages. or

for "misinterpreting and misquoting" their 
representatives in news and features articles. The most 
poignant example of these campaigns was. up until 
two weeks ago, the raging and sometimes hysterical 
debate on the meaning of freedom of speech both in 
the United States and outside its borders. Quite few 
people were enlightened by this dialogue. but more 
than a handful were disgusted by rhe tone of the 
discussion. 

The forum that 1 put together on Nicaragua during 
the middle of last month has given rise to all the 
components of both how the community views the 
vital funcllons of the Guardian . and how the concept of 
"freedom of speech" enters into its dialectical process. 
Although many friends and acquaintances alike told 
me that they enjoyed the forum because the depth of 
the remarks by Profs. Hallin and Faroohar. apparently 
my critics were outraged by the fact that no right-wing 
intellectual was present at the discussion to debate the 
merits of the others' perspectives. Well then , in order 
to set a few minds at ease for the present, I will clarify 
my motivations for choosing the route that I did with 
the forum ; hopefully, this will illuminate a portion of 
my views concerning the role of the Guardian in its 
present environment with regards to its function as a 
vital organ for that popular First Amendment clause. 

As you mayor may not know, UCSD is not deluged 
wi th right-Wing intellectuals in the hiStory, literature or 
social science departments. To my knowledge, there 
are no professors at UCSD specializing in Central 
America who subscribe to the beliefs of the U.s. right-
wing concerning the Nicaragua question. I did not 
thi nk it would be appropriate to bring in a student 
member of the "Junior-right" to be lacerated in a 
debate by two Individuals who have years of 
knowledge and experience about the region. 1 also 
chose not to bring in a member of the right froll} the 
outside - say Edward Nicoles, Robert Leiken, Ronald 
Radosh, or Charles Karuthammer - because these 

ethicless dotes do not normally make themselves 
available to progressive univerSity papers (especially 
y,~thout being paid for it). More importantly, I wanted 
the average UCSD student to be able to identify with 
the learning of the members of their own community. 
But above all else, 1 felt that it was extremely important 
for the seemingly unaware average student or staff 
member to hear a discussion on Nicaragua that 
emphasized the hislOry of the country and the origins 
of IOday's conflict. 

It has almost always been true that the right-wing 
seClor of this country dismisses entire histories of 
other nations when seeking to win suppOrt of our 
active populace on a particular issue . In regards 10 the 
Nicaragua forum , I would say the participants 
expounded quite honestly - given our special 
constr::ints about the makeup of the Sandinista 
government (that there are some marxist-Ieninsls in ill, 
which is always what the right-wing in this coumry are 
screaming about anyway. The difference, of course, is 
that the Right sees {his as reason enough to decimate 
an emire country using a mercenary band of thieves 
and puppets in order 10 overthrow them; the profs. do 
not. 1 believe that the forum also contributed to 
dispelling the myth that Nicaragua IS a Soviet client 
state, which is the gigantic lie that the Right uses to 
scare people into aiding the Contras. 

All of us "concerned citizens" know that if the UCSD 
community desires to hear the media parrot the 
Reagan Administration's line about Nicaragua, the only 
thing they have to do is tum on the tube to the three 
major ne tworks or pick-up almost any daily nespaper 
and they will quickly gain satisfaction. But that is not 
the role of the Guardian in today's society; that is, to 
provide more free media space to a movement 
attempti ng to silence the opposition viewpoints from 
around the world by the use of guns and money. The 
Guardian's role , for this writer, is to provide space for

Editor: 

I had been scheduled to 
participate in the debate on 

icaragua which appeared in the 
February 17 issue, but was 
prevemed flom doing so at the 
last minute. Reading over the 
contents, I found myself in 
substantial agreeme nt with the 
able contributions of Profs. Hall in 
and Foroohar. At one point, 
though , 1 found my elf framing 
an additional contribution to the 
discussion, which 1 would like to 
offer here. 

The issue concerns the 
composition of the Sandinista 
leadership , speCifically, with its 
"marxist" or "marxist-leninist" 
character. Now this is certainly 
nm a trivial question. In fact, it is 
so Important that it deserves the 
highest degree of clarity, 
especially when posed in the 
United States, with its long and 
obfuscating tradition of 
anticommunism.

Let me say then that to sort 
the Sandinistas out according to 
whether they are marxist or not 
approaches the issue in the 
wrong way The key question in 
Nicaragua, as it is in so many 
parts of the Third World , has 
been and remains how to deal 
with the immense domination 
exercised by the United States. 

This is the concrete reality in 
Nicaraguan history and everyday 
life; and no one who has lived 
there can avoid it. The question 
really is, then, what is a 
Nicaraguan to do who wants to 
overcome this domination and 
assert the sovereignity of his/ her 
people? Obviously, understand 
and confront the nature of u.s. 
Dower. Since this happens to be 
capitalist, those Nicaraguans who 
have been the most serious about 
asserting their freedom from the 
giant to the north have turned to 
marxism, the discourse of anti-
capitalism, as a starring point. 
Anything less is ' to go along with 
the ancien regime. Then there is 
the further problem of what to 
do with marxism, from 
strategies of insurrection to those 
of socialist reconstruction . Here, 
as the participants point out, 
there is a very lively debate in 
Nicaragua, always conditioned by 
the reality of U.S. aggression. 
Indeed, there are several parties

twO quotations from tHe Ri~t

opinions on history, Latin 
America and on differing

From Henry Kissinger to the 
former Chilean Ambassador to 
the U.s., Gabriel Valdes: 

"You came here speaking oj 
Latin America. but this is not 
important. Nothing important 
can come from the South. 
History has "evcr been produced 
in the South. The axis oj history 
starts in Moscow, goes to Bonn, 

cTOSStS'over to Washington, and 
then goes to T()Ryo. What 
happens in the South is of no 
importance. You 're wasting your 
time. " 

From former u.s. 
Ambassador to the Uni ted 
Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick: 

"If. .. reyolutionary leaders 
describe the U.S. as the scourge 
of the 20th century, the enemy 
of Jreedom-loving people. the 
perpetrator of impenalism .. . 
then they are not authentic

friends . Should al'!}'one question 
U.S. motives in the world

treated as enemies."

in Nicaragua who reject the 
Sandinistas for not being 
sufficiently orthodox in their 
marxism. In any case, the key 
issue is nor "marxism" in the 
abstract, but resistance to U.S. 
domination . That is why 
Washington makes war, and 
attempts desperately to win over 
American public opinion against 
the Sandinistas. 

In this regard, I would also 
like to express my dismay that

somehow a "peri pheral issue" is 
astounding. Whether or not the 
calamity of a general war ever 
happens, the illegal war that is 
happening right now, in the 
name of "freedom ," with U.S. tax 
money and U.S. planning, is 
causing untold suffering. It can 
be stopped if people of good will 
work at stopping it. I can't think 
of a higher priority than that.

The rising cost of AIDS 
By j.W. AKERS-SASSAMAN, Capitol Corre~pondtnl 

SACRAM ENTO, UC Wire -
Caring for AIDS pa tients is goi ng 
to cost the sta te of Califo rnia a 
lot of money - possibly up to 
$406 mil lion in 1991, according 
to Legislative Analyst Elizabeth 
HilL 

It currently COStS them over 
$20,000 a year to provide d rugs, 
hospital care and doctor's 
services to the more serious of 
California's over 6,600 AIDS 
patients, Hill said in her review 
of Gov. Deukmejian's p roposed 

1987 -88 budget. Given that the 
number of Cali fornia AIDS 
victims will require more 
in tensive and expensive 
trea tment as their condition 
worsens , the price tag may reach 
$255 million to $406 million a 
year in four years, she sa id. 

The cost may even be higher, 
Hill said., "This estimate 
d rastically understates the full 
cost of AI DS becuse it does not 
include certain (unspecified ) 
medical costS, supponive 

services, prevention and 
education , or mdirect costs." 

In addition, "treatment of 
individuals with AIDS-Related 
Complex (ARC), more intensive 
treatments due to new drugs, 
increases in IV drug abuse AIDS 
population and cOStS of treating 
AIDS-related dementia may 
greatly increase COStS above our 
estimates," she said . 

The cumulative ind irect social 
costs, including lost wages and 
potential income, could rise to

between $7.1 billion and $9 
billion, Hill said. 

Gov. Deukmejian's proposed 
budget fo r the next fiscal year 
contains $21.4 million for the 
Depanment of Health Services 
AIDS unit, 1.1 percent more than 
the current year. It would go fo r 
treatment, counseling, education 
and surveillance. An additional 
c;9.6 million would go fo r 
Unive rsity of Californ ia research . 

According to Hill , the best way 
to reduce future costs is to 
prevent the spread of the virus 
through education. 

"The most effective way to 
reduce costs is to reduce the 
number of cases." she said. ~

Transient population dwindles on UCSD campus 
By D. Hen 

W HILE there are occasional reports of transients on the 
UCSD campus, Police Officer 
Ban Luu explained that "Most do 
not stay vety long. Some are 
reaUy transients who we see only 
once or twice. But some are here 
on a semi-permanent basis and 
we see them over and over." 

This would not have been the 
case in 1983. Sergeant Bob Jones 
of the Campus Police described 
the problem as being much 
worse back then. "Abou't three 
years ago we would find whole 
families living out of cars. There 
were a lot more then because the 
economy was so bad. Some 
would teU you that they hadn't 
had a square meal in months. 
Some wanted you to take them 
to jail because then they could 
get a good meal and a warm 
place to stay." 

UC San Diego has developed 
roughly one-third of the propeny 
it owns between Interstate-5 and 
Torrey Pines Road. Most of the 
buildings are clustered together 
towards the southern half of the 
campus, leaving large stretches of 
eucalyptus groves to the north 
and canyons covered with brush 
to the northeast. While this land 
does fit into the long range plans 
of the university, right now 
its only inhabitants are wildlife

and a few individuals whose 
unofficial relationship with the 
university may last no longer 
than a few days. 

Most students do not venture 
into these parts of the campus, 
save an occasional jogger. This 
makes it an ideal place for the 
homeless, who for the most part 
do not want to auract a lot of 
attention and need shelter for a 
night or two. "The attraction of 
UCSD is that it is so isolated," 
said Sgt. Jones. The transients 
are difficult to see with the 
abundance of underbrush and 
trees. "People drive right by and 
don't even notice they are there," 
Sgt. Jones added. 

The isolation of UCSD, in 
comparison with the more 
crowded downtown area, also 

offers transients a sense of 
secumy. "T hey are nO! harassed 
as much," stated Luu, who deals 
with many transients direcdy. 
"They feel safer because the 
downtown crime is much less 
likely to happen here." 

While the homeless of UCSD 
find security on campus, they 
also view the area as a better 
place to search for food and 
seek monetary handouts. UCSD 
students "are easier to get I these 
things] from lin comparison] to 
people downtown who are 
immune to it and walk on by. A 
young student dealing with it for 
the first time might give them 
something," Sgt. Jones said. 

Sgt. J ones also Ii sted several 
campus locations likely to be 
inhabited by the homeless; 
included are the Camp Calion 
section of campus to the nonh, 
the fields behind the Coast 
Apartments to the south , and 
sections of land near the archery 
range to the east. However. on a 
recent inspection these areas 
remained uninhabited, according 
to Sgt. Jones. The lack of 
transients confirms Luu's opinion 
that there is not a signi ficant 
transient problem at the present 
time. 

UCSD officer Sylvester Jones 
said he sees "a lot of I transients] 
at different times of the year," as 
they move to the best climates. 
"They travel south for warnl 
weather and then north again ix 
months later when the weather 

down in Baja rums bad ," he said. 
On a recent evening, he found 

what appeared to be a shelter left 
behind by a nomadic wanderer,

Old 101 . 

It was situated in the brush 
north of Third College, just west 
of Old 101 on what used to be 
Camp Calion. Among the articles 
found in the makeshift home 
was a chair, a weathered Bible, a 
fire pit and a tarp for protection 
from the weather. It did not 
appear as though anyone had 
inhabited it for a while, but 
Sylvester Jones explained mat 
"he may come back this way and 
he knows he's got a place to 
stay. He knows he's gO! a plastic 
bag for the rain .... "

Surviving on the 
streets of San Diego 
D OWNTOWN San Diego is not the ideal place to siruate oneself on a street comer after dark. This pan of town has the largest concentration of transients and on a 
recent evening there were several around who I was hoping 
might give an intervifN. However, finding these people was far 
easier than getti ng th\: interview itself. 

Most of the street people I approached refused to even talk. 
Some were understandably bitter. "[The problem] isn't getting 
any better so why even tty," one transient yelled at me. "I do 
what I have to do to survive." 

Finally, I was able to get someone to talk to me in exhange 
for a cigarette or two. A man 'by the name of Casey turned out 
to view himself as something more glamorous. "I'm a cowboy 
hobo. I'm nor a street person. They're bums. I'm not one of 
those," Casey said. 

When I first ran across him he was ttying to find a place to 
sleep for the night and find shelter from the rain. "Evetytime I 
find a doorway or overhang to sleep under they come along 
and tell me to move on," he said , motioning tOward two 
security guards across the street. He said it is dimcult to find a 
place to sleep in the downtown area where he is nor bothered 
by someone. 

He told me that he had been riding freight trains around the 
country for close to thirty years and is planmng on writing a 
book about his experiences. Lately his stories have come to 
include what he considers harassment by the pel ice. Casey 
related a story of how he was issued a ticket for jaywalking and 
was later arrested for not paying the line. "Where am ( going to 
get that kind of money?" he asked,

not a good barometer of 
Steiman's performance. "She 
pitched great for five innings," 
said Wight, "but we weren't 
hitting some crucial errors, and 
her arm I tiringl starred to take 
its toll at the end of the game:' 

Desperate for replacements, 
head coach Colleen Wight

players at other positions in 
order to assemble a pitching

A few immodest proposals 
Here are some quotes from 

some of the less modest sports 
figures taken from Sportswit: 

Boston Bruins center Derek 
Sanderson , naming the best 
hockey player he ever saw: "Me -
on instant replay." 

Chess champion Bobby 
Fischer: "there's only one 

immortal player in the world 
today and it's Fischer. It's nice to 
be modest, but it's stupid not to 
tell the truth ." 

Larry Bird , after the Celtics' 
1981 championship: "I could 
stand up here aU night talking 
about the whole team . But I'm 
getting sick and tired of talking

about myself." 
Los Angeles Angels pitcher Bo 

Belinsky, after tossing a no-hitter: 
"My only regret in life is that I 
can't sit in the stands and watch 
me pitch ." 

Reggie Jackson: "The only 
reason I don't like playing in the 
World Series is that 1 can't watch 
myself play." 

Tommy Lasorda, after JeTI)' 
Reuss' no-hitter: "It just couldn't 
have happened to a greater guy. 
Well - yes, it could . It could 
have happened to me." 

The oldest team in the NBA? 
The Celtics with an average age 
of 29.1 years. They are lollowed 
by: the Nuggets, 27.39; Lakers, 
27 .38; Spurs, 27.14; and theJazz, 
27 .12 

The Rockets are the taUest 
team with an average height of 
6'8 .23"; the comes the Mavericks, 
6'8.21 H; Lakers, 6'8.17"; Suns, 
.6'8 .07"; and the Knicks, 67.86". 

The five best records in 
ba seball ove r the past decade: 
Yankees (989-730), Orioles (969-
750). Phillies (947-779), Dodgers 
(945-779), and the Red Sox 
(941 -782). 

If the Cubs don't accept Andre 
Dawson's offer, it's going to be 
hard to convince anybody that 
there isn't collusion among the 
owners. The former Expo 
outfielder wants to play at 
Wrigley Field so badly, he has 
offered to sign a one year 
contract with Chicago for 
whatever the team thinks is fair. 
Also, Cub pitcher Rick Sutcliffe 
has made a serious offer to pay 
$100 ,000 of Dawson's contract 
because he feels Dawson could 
immensely improve the learn . If 
Chicago doesn't sign him, there 
is definitely somethi ng wrong ~ 

Track team 
loosens up 
By MARK PRESSMAN,Slaff Wnte 

T RACK is a seasonal sport of maturation . Runners are noted for "gelling" 
their strides and bettering their · 
speeds as the season moves 
along. Often , a runner won't 
loosen up umil the third or 
fourth meet in the year, 

It seems, however, mat this 
may not be the case with at least 
one member of UCSD's track 
team this year. In only the 
second team meet this year, 
Gisele English ran only two 
seconds off the national 
qualifying time in the 800 meters 
for the women. 

"I was happy with my 
performance. It's so early LO run 
so well; I was surprised," said a 
content English. 

All Division III teams from 
Southern California were invited 
to last Saturday'S Long Beach 
Relays. Some of the schools 
present were the College of otJe 
Dame, Occidental, the Redlands, 
Claremont, and Whittier, to 
name a few. And a full card of 
events was held, including the 
100 and 200 meter sprints, the 
distance runs of 800 and 5,000 
meters as well as the 16,000 
meter 4 runner relay. 

"We had many good, early 
season, times," said coach 
Andrew Skief, "But there were 
also some disappointments as 
compared to last week." Many of 
the TriLOn runners turned in 
good personal times, but feU 
short at the tape versus some 
vel)' tough competition. "We'll 
improve, no doubt about that," 
continued Skief, "We're where 
we should be and starting to 
geU." 

There is no type of POSt-
season playoff hierarchy for the 
track team , but there is the 
Nationals, which individual 
runners compete in if they ran 
competitively enough in th e year. 
Next year, though , a new 
conference will unite the 
Division III schools now 
competing, includ ing UCSD. 
under which a onference 
championship meet would be 
held LO crown a champ, 

The track team is holding a 
home meet March 14 at Wjlrren 
East, and they will be comperin..!L 
against Whittier and USD. ~

Action, no matter how 
violent, seems to be the key 
ingredient for a successful 
motion picture. "Superman" 
director Richard Donner says, 
"Action films are market-
able." Donner along with Joel 
Silver produced "Lethal 
Weapon," a police action-
thriller film starring Mel 
Gibson, Dannv Glover, and 
Gary Busey. 

"Weapon" is a lethal mix of 
humor and suspense that 
revolves around the 
relationship between two 
Vietnam veterans turned Los 
Angeles undercover police 
officers. Roger Murtaugh, 
portrayed by Glover, is a 
respected, just turned 50 
veteran officer. He, much to 
his chagrin, is paired with 
Gibson's character, Martin 
Riggs. A "Lethal Weapon" 
himself, Riggs is thought of by 
his associates as being dose to 
going "over the edge" due to 
the recent death of his wife of 
11 years. 

The mismat.:hed pair find 
themselves involved in a 
highl y dangerous drug 
smuggling case, that stems 
from what appears to be a 
simple prostitute's suicide. 
The case brings them into 
several confrontations with 
the mercenary Mr, Joshua, 
believably played by Gary 

Busey. In a recent interview, 
the men discussed what went 
into the making of the $15 
million movie . "I love 
entertainment and want to 
leave a movie feeling good," 
Donner said. Of the films he's 
made, his favorite is "Inside 
Moves," yet he contends 
"You can't get people to see 
films like that." After reading 
the screenplay by a 23 year old 
UCLA grad, Shane Black, 
both Donner and Silver 
gathered the cast for what they 
consider to be a "good-old 
fashioned action film." 

Gibson good naturedly 
fielded questions along with 
co-stars Glover and Busey. 
Born in upstate New York, 
Gibson has lived in Australia 
since the age of 11. The "Mad 
Max" trilogy directed by 
George Miller brought 
Gibson international fame, 
though he had already won 
the Australian Film Institute's 
Best Actor Award for his role 
in one of his earlier films, 
"Tim." He seemed level-
headed about his stardom, 
however, commenting that 
the "star" concept "isn't 
normal, it's strange that all of 
you are sitting here interview-
ing me. But, I might as well 
enjoy it, although you have to 
give away some of your 
personal freedoms, like your 

anonymity," he continued. 
Glover, best known for his 

portrayal of Mister in the 
serious dramatic film, "The 
Color Purple," welcomed the 
Murtaugh role that allowed 
him to "explore humor." 
Some saw his Mister role as 
furthering the negative 
stereotype of black men, Yet 
Glover said he "welcomed the 
controversy and the 
discourse" that "The Color 
Purple" stirred . He also 
mentioned the Mister role 
wasn't that off-track since 
black women in their 60s and 
70s have said, "I know that 
story." 

Busey's stone-cold por-
trayal of Mr. Joshua was 
assisted by the effective 
technique of stripping the 
color from his hair. Busey 
remembered the identifi-
cation problem he faced 
follOWing the highly 
successful film '~The Buddy 
Holly Story," "people would 
say 'Buddy Holly - you were 
great in the Gary Busey 
Story.' " He has since 
dropped 60 pounds, for he 
found "I could only play fat 
guys and all they do is sweat." 
He found working on "Lethal 
Weapons" to be the most fun 
he has had in his 15 years in 
the movie industry. 

In the credits for "Lethal 

Weapon," Dave Robinson 
was remembered in tribute for 
his stuntwork in the film, 
After completing the major 
stunt filming of "Lethal 
Weapon," Robinson was 
killed on the set of another 
film. Donner notes that 
"Robinson was an innovator, 
and planned most of the 
major stunts in the film, 

. Silver stressed that "due to 
the vast preparation for the 
whole picture, no stunts put 
anyone in danger in this film." 

When asked about the 
violence in the film, Donner 
contended that it was 
"action" and that they are "in 
the business of illusion, that's 
our magic." Over the 65 day 
shooting period the cast and 
crew experienced the 
extensive cooperation of the 
city of Los Angeles as well as 
the police and sheriffs offices. 
At certain points, police 
officers gave their comments. 
That gives the film what 
Donner calls a "sense of 
realism. " 

"Lethal Weapon" opens 
tomorrow, March 6, in local 
theaters. The exciting mix of 
humor and suspense adds an 
edge to this police thriller. 
However entertaining the 
"action" may be, "Weapon" 
still contains the typical dose 
of lethal violence.

"Angel Heart" is a very well 
made horror movie, where the 
viewer is scared up to the very 

. last moments of the film. One 
of the reasons "Angel Heart" 
is an effective spine<hiller is 
due to eerie shot 

sequences that more than 
make up for the somewhat 
puzzling holes of the storyline. 

"Angel Heart," set in the 
mid~fifties, is a movie about a 
private detective named Harry

is hired to track down Johnny

Struggling to come back IRS Records/hiatus Mu.sic Trivia Quiz 
The lights grow dim, and 

somewhere from the outskirts 
of the stage thunderous 
applause grows to a crescendo 
level. But the spotlight that 
shines on the stage does not 
fall on some flashy celebrity in 
leather and sequins. The man 
on stage is just a man who 
makes his living as a rock star, 
and who is trying to find the 
strength to make a comeback 
performance after an 
assassination attempt at his 
last concert. 

So starts "The Incredibly 
Famous Willy Rivers," which 
makes its west coast premiere 
at the Old Globe Theatre. It's 
not a complicated plot, and 
it's intuitively obvious to the 
audience what our hero will 
do and where the pIa y is going. 
Willy (Brian Kerwin) 
suddenly finds his glittering 
world shattered by a bullet 
through his chest. And now, a 
few weeks before his 
comeback appearance, he 
scours the country looking for 
friends to attend his concert. 

What he finds instead is 
that people treat celebrities as 
images rather than indivi~ 
duals. They adopt them and 
make them over into what 

by kristina Hem 
they think they should be. 
Fans perceive the c.elebrity's 
job as representing everything 
that they admire but can't 
have. And in some cases, this 
perception can lead to 
jealousy. Willy learns this fact 

when he confronts his would~ 
be assassin and finds that he 
was aiming not at Willy the 
person and not even Willy the 
performer, but at a 
representative of something 
that the Everyman can never 
be. 

This drama is yet another 
triumph for playwright 

Stephen Metcalfe, whose past 
works include "Emily" 
(1986), "Vikings" (1985) 
and "Strange Show"( 1984). 
The cast is superb, especially 
Brian Kerwin in the lead role, 
James McDaniel as a 
philosophizing reggae singer, 
and Dann Florek who has a 
dual role as an uptight 
manager and a freewheeling 

singer~composer with a 
serious substance abuse 
problem. 

"The Incredibly Famous 
Willy Rivers" asks its 
audience to examine why we 
demand that certain 
individuals put themselves on 
a pedestal that's high enough 
to be aloof but yet close 
enough to touch. And why, in 
some cases, do we treat them 
with the respect saved for our 
worst enemies? Are we 
looking for role models or are 
we so insecure that we need 
the bigger than life image of .

"The Incredibly Famous 
Will'll Rivers" continues its 
run at the Old Globe through 
March 8. 

A range of music 
titled debut album perfectly 
demonstrates the versatile 
voice of lead singer Johnette 
Napolitano, who ranges from 
sounding like Crissie Hynde 
to Maria McKee to Exene to 
something no one has ever 
quite heard. The Los Angeles 
trio's combinanon of rock, 
n~punk, and even pop has 
them heralded by a few daring 
critics as being the best new 
band of the year and will 
hopefully be remembered 

around the time of next year 's 
Grammys. The honesty of 
both the music and the lyrics 
is represented in the up~beat 
song "True," in which 
Napolitano sings, "I do all I 
can and it's all I can do to be 
true." 

Dozens of albums come out 
per month. How well they fare 
commercially oftens depends 
on whether they are from an 
established artist or not. 
Granted, everyone is making 
albums nowadays; however, 
there are some, more than 
others, that should definitely 

be heard. The following five 
albums are receiving little 
recognition and little radio 
play, yet are worthy of both. 

The Boomtown Rats never 
made it big in the States, so 
why should a solo album by 
the lead singer do any better? 
When the lead singer happens 
to be up for a Nobel Peace 
Prize and has already been 
knighted by the Queen of 
England (to name a few of Bob 
Geldof's recent achieve~ 
ments), you'd think that 
people would at least buy his 
album out of respect. Throw 
in moving lyrics accompanied 
with talented musicians, and 
Atlantic Records should have 
a number one album on their 
hands. Instead, they have a 
financial flop. The negligent 
reception given to "Deep in 
the Heart of Nowhere" goes 
unexplained as the album 
generously proves that Geldof 
is more than just a 
humanitarian; he is also a 
talented singer and song~ 
writer. 

In 1977, Meat Loaf's debut 
album "Bat Out of Hell" went 

multi~platinum, but that was 
basically because of the man 
with one of the best voice in 

by mark pinkus 
all music. Two less sucessful 
follow~ups set Loaf on a four 
year break only to re~nter the 
scene in late 1986 with a new 
album, a partially new band 
and a national tour. Doing his 
usual mixing of high~powered 
rock songs with touching love 
songs, this ten~song collection 

is as worthy of your ear as his 
first effort. The title track for 
Loafs latest: "Blind Before I 
Stop," sums up his future 
plans, "A9d I'll go blind 
before I stop/ They're going to 
have to come and lock me 
up/ And I'll go blind before I 
stop/ 'Cause this boy mama 
wants to rock." Once you 
listen to this album, you'll 
hope your sight will remain 
unimpaired for a long time. 

As the Kinks slowly begin to 
age, the British rock sound 
they formulated has all but 
disappeared, making way for 
both the techno~pop and 

pseudo~punk scene. Julian 
Cope, in recording his self~ 
titled debut E.P., offers up a 
solid rock beat without the 
annoyance of overdriven 
guitars. With interesting 
lyrics and a captivating voice, 
Cope demonstrates th e 
potential to make it big as long 
as people ~et a chance to hear 

him. "World Shut Your 
Mouth," an anthem~like tune 
written by Cope, has already 
been released as both a single 
and video. Keep your ears 
open for this energetic rocker 
who has figured out a 
successful way to combine the 
fine points of '60s rock 
without sounding si~ly in the 
'80s. 

Karl Wallinger ' should be 
considered one of the most 
talented artists around; he 
sings, plays guitar, bass and 
sampling keyboards, writes 
the lyrics and even produces 
his "Private Revolution" 
album. Wallinger, an ex~ 
Waterboy, has recorded his 
first solo album under the 
name Warld Party, and its 
progressive sound is worth 
hearing. His peace~riented 
lyriCS, along with his flowery 
pants and Lennon style glasses 
(as seen on the album cover) 
might worry the listener that 
this is just another poor 
remake of '60s music. But 
anyone that has heard "Ships 
of Fools," the only song 
which is getting any radio 

attention, realizes that 
although the base of the music 
may be paying homage to 
decades gone by, the blend of 
rock, jazz and neo~psychadelia 
make for an intriguing sound 
that clearly stands on its own. 

The fifth album is the one 
that seems to have the most

that blows good teams away.

1M Golf Championsihps 
Are In The Worksl 

The new expanded UCSD 
Intramural Golf Championships 
have just been announced for the 
first week of Spring Quaner, 
Friday-thru-Sunday, April 3-5. 

The new three-day champion-
ship fonnat replaces the old one 
day, early morning pro-am 
tournament that wore out its 
welcome at the Torrey Pines 
Municipal Golf course last year. 

This year's tournament will 
feature play on three different 
courses ... Torrey Pines South on 
Friday, April 3, Tijuana Country 
Club on Saturday, April 4, and 
Torrey Pines Nonh for the finals on 
Sunday, April S. 

The first 48 players to register at 
the Canyonview Recreation Office 
beginning Monday will receive 

starting times for Friday's first day 
of play at Torrey-South. First tee 
times start at 10:30 am. 

The low 24 score rs (no 
handicaps) will advance to the 
second day's play at Tijuana cc. 
The low combined 12 scorers after 
play at Tijuana will advance to the 
final day at Torrey Pines-Nonh. The 
tournament has been designed to 
give UCSD golfers a taste of what a 
PGA Tournament might be like. 

Registration fee will be $25 at 
Canyonview with those players not 
making the cut receiving a partial 
refund back for Saturday'S portion 
of the green fees, 

The UCSD 1M International, as 
the event will be called, is open to 
all members of the UCSD campus 
community (students, faculty, and 
staff) with the exception of all 
current members of the UCSD 
Intercollegiate Golf Team.

Cryer at home lara: Yeah, together they were able to elicit a lot of sympathy from us so we could relate to 
Morgan's unfortunate 
position. He so desperately 
wanted a family, and they 
didn't seem to want him. In 
many ways, Alan Smithee's 
directing combined with Ken 
Hixon's script resembles the 
works of John Hughes 

(director ~writer). I was 
reminded several times of 
" Ferris BueHer's Day Off" in 
Cryer's sometimes rebellious 
attitude, and even " The 
Breakfast Club," since Paul 
Gleason plays the villain in 
both films .

Although straight out of

campaign gimmick, " Yote for

PRESENTS 

Bands at bat 
by bernard yin 

The "1987 Revelle Battle of 
the Bands" was the fifth to my 
witness. Attracting in the past 

full~house audiences and, of 
course, bands. My curiosity 
was aroused this year by the 
news that some of the most 
interesting bands, some 
student based, were not 
chosen to compete and that 
the advertising seemed 
minimal. Being fanatically tied 
to the local scene and many of 
its bands, I took it upon 
myself to better understand a 
situation which ired me and 
many others. 

On Friday night, Feb. 27, 
when the event took place, I 
prf)ceeded to seek out a 
Revelle programming figure 
to talk to me regarding the 
situation. The crowd was the 
smallest I had ever seen at the 
Battle. I found someone who 
could give me insight. One 
issue discussed was that of 
" draw." It seemed that the 
desire to book at least some 
bands which were known 
crowd bringers would be 
good. 

This might be argued as a 
patch for the poor advertising 
since, in the past, band draw 
seemed less of a concern. One 
of this year's featured bands 
had only weeks ago played a 
Revelle noon concert and a 
T .G. on the same day. 
To balance the budget set for 

u C S D 

the event was called to my 
attention as a noteworthy 
goal. Fair enough, some of the 
bands were quite new to the 
local scene. A major 
qualifying point was the 
quality of each band's demo 
tape but probably the weakest 
point in the band selecting 
process because bands of any 
quality often perform much 
differently on tape than they 
do live. 

Many past " Battle of the 
Bands'" performers have gone • 
on to respectable lengths in 
the Southern California 
madhouse of music. Con-
sider, as well, that in such a 
scene, many bands achieve 
more by cooperating with 
each other rather than 
" battling" it out. In a poor 
local scene, such an event can 
be made into a significant 
showcase of up and coming 
bands, many of which are 
creating their own material in 
the pursuit of more than 
quick cash and hormone 
glory. 

It would be fantastic if 
Revelle could improve the 
programming of such events, 
and possibly multiply them, 
but the event was by no means 
a failure. "1987's Battle of the 
Bands" might just serve as a 
reminder of the difficulties 
which exist on campus and in 
San Diego for upcoming 
bands and promoters alike.

---....I 

All of you, of course, read 
my last review of Woody 
Allen's movie "Radio Days." 
In that review, my last line was 
something like, "I wonder 
when ['11 get to review a movie 
I don't like?" That was 
because I had seen about five 
or so movies in a row that I 
had liked . Well, times, as they 
say, are a~hanging. A couple 
of days ago I had the unique 
pleasure of seeing a preview of 
Robert Altman's new movie 
titled "Beypnd Therapy." [ 
hated it. I really disliked it. I 
cannot express how much I 
didn't like that movie, but 
since that is what I get paid to 
do, I will try. 

But first let me tell you a 
story. This movie was made 
from a play of the same name. 
I also had the luck to see the 
Del Mar Rep perform the play 
last Christmas. I hated it then 
too. So when I found out that 
I was going to get to review the 
movie, I said, "Good, I'll hate 
it." This is not the way you 
want to go into a movie. The 
problem with both the play 
and the movie is the same 
exact thing. What are the only 
possible similarities that there 
could be between the two? Of 
course, it has to be the story. It 
is that bad. 

"Beyond Therapy" is a 
movie about therapists and 
their patients. I have problems 
with that; it seems to me that 
the time to make fun of 
therapy was around 1981. [ 
thought this was the time to 
make fun of aerobics. The 
material seems so dated. 

A movie in therapy 
by phil macgovern 

The movie opens with a 
man named Bruce (Jeff 
Goldblum) and a woman 
named Prudence (Julie 
Hagerty) meeting at a French 
restaurant for a blind date 
arranged through the 
personals section of a 
magazine. Let me tell you, I 
love both of these actors, 
especially Goldblum (al~ 
though [ kept having the 
senation that his fingernails 
were going to peel off, a la 
"The Fly"). They do a good 
job with the trash they are 
handed to read. But the 
dialogue is such junk. 

It turns out Bruce has a 
male lover named Bob, but his 
therapist recommends that he 
try a personal to meet women. 
Prudence will have no part of 
this and runs off. Actually, 
they both run off to the 
couches of their respective 
therapists: Bruce to Glenda 
Jackson, playing a doctor 
whose name I can't 
remember, and Prudence to 
Dr. Stuart Framingham, Slime 
Royale (Tom Conti). 

When I saw the play, 
Bruce's therapist was the most 
hilarious part of the play. In 
the movie, Jackson seems 
tame compared to the play. 
She only goes through about 
five words and much more 
slowly. It lost something in 
the translation. (Speaking of 
translation, half this movie 
ends up being in French for 
some reason.) 

Tom Conti is better, really 
repulsive and slimy. He has 
this Italian accent that will 
drive you batty, since his 
name is Framingham. The 
therapists happen to be in 
adjoining rooms, and 
something odd happens at 20 
past which I can't tell you. 
Bruce places another 
personal, and gets an answer. 
He goes to the same French 
restaurant and guess who 
answers his ad? You got it, 
there's Prudence. This time 
they get along better, and 
Bruce ends up sleeping at 
Prudence's. He comes home 
to a justifiably angered Bob 
(Christopher Guest). Guest 

speaks in that stereotypical 
"gay" voice, the kind I have 
never heard anyone use in real 
life, but he too does a good job 
with this script. As the movie 
gets along, Prudence and 
Bruce are becoming closer, 
and Bob starts to feel rejected. 
Bruce wants to marry 
Prudence ("Bob can have a 
room over the garage"), but 
neither Bob nor Prudence 
wants any of that. 

Bruce brings Bob ro see 
Glenda Jackson, and Bruce 
and Prudence go off to the 
same French restaurant . 
Jackson convinces Bob to vent 
his anger by shooting Bruce 
and Prudence with a take 
pistol at the restaurant. This 
scene is the funniest in the 
movie. It is done entirely in 
slow motion, and lasts for 
about five minutes. Everyone 
in the restaurant, which is 
crowded this time and Dr. 
Framingham ends up there 
too, thinks they are being 
massacred, and it is hilarious. 
It ends with Bruce and 
Prudence going off to get 
married and Bob going after a 
waiter. 

Unfortunately, the 
restaurant scene near the end 
is the only scene that is 
comical. Altman directs like a 
five year~old, throwing in a lot 
of stuff that does not belong, 
like the sounds of about five 
car crashes. I just wish I had 
done what half the audience 
did, which was walk out. 

Don't go to see this movie. 
Don't even rent it when it 
comes out on tape. It would 
be wasting your money. 

Angel 
Continued from page 2 
DeNiro). As Angel looks for 
Favorite, he finds that 
Favorite was deeply involved 
with devil worship. 

As the trail leads Angel to 
New Orleans, there becomes 
an increasing number of grisly 
murders. One of the faults in 
"Angel Heart" is th.e 
reasoning behind the 
murders. The theme of 
psychological torment is not 
apparent, and the murders 
seem unexplained and the 
viewer wonders even at the 
end by whom and why the 
crimes were committed. 

In New Orleans, Angel 
meets Epiphany Proudfoot 
(Lisa Bonet of "The Cosby 
Show"), the daughter of one 
of Favorite's lovers. Epiphany 
is a voodoo priestess; a scene 
in which a chicken is 
sacrificed is explicit. In 
viewing the unedited version 
of this film, the much talked 
about "X" rated sex scene was 
shown in its entirety, however 
it is said only ten seconds were 
edited. This scene between 
Rourke and Bonet is really 

mind~boggling, due to the 
quick edits and jump cuts of 
images amidst the shocking 

love~making. 
As a whole, "Angel Heart" 

is a cut above the usual horror 
movie fare. It is origional and 
it is terrifying; becasuse of the 
intense photography the 
viewer is constantly surprised, 
shocked and horrified. This is 
a movie worth seeing.

O'Brien revives an American opera classic 
The San Diego Opera is 

making a sincere attempt to 
attract more students tQ their 
future productions, and their 
timing couldn't be better. 
Beginning tonight and 
running through Sunday, is. 
in the words of the director 
who made "Porgy and Bess" a 
hit, "The most identifiable 
American opera ever 
written." Jack O'Brien's 

Tony~award winning revival 
of this modern English , 

common~man's story, that 
will play at the Civic Theatre, 
crosses the "snob" barrier 
which opera unfortunately 
has about it. 

It has an ability to alienate 
" boob~tube" blue~collar 
Americans who might 
otherwise support such forms 
of cultural enrichment. 

Set in the 1930's in a place 
called Catfish Row, a black 
quarter of Charleston, South 
Carolina, "Porgy and Bess" is 
based on a true story of a 

crippled beggar turned tragic 
hero and his infatuation with a 
fickle girl from the 
ne igh bor hood . Dona ld 
Dierks, the an DiegQ Union 
music critic, writes, "Samuel 
Smalls was a familiar figure in 
Charleston. He was casually 
seen to be a' pitiful. badly 
crippled black beggar who got 
around town in a crudely 
fashioned cart pulled by a goat 
- hence, the nickname "Goat 
Sammy." But Charleston 
police knew that "Goat 
Sammy" had a darker side. 
His long police record listed 
numerous assaults upon 
women, and his last run~in 
with the law was for an 
attempt to shoot one Maggie 
Barnes on a Saturday night in 
the black ghetto called 
Cabbage Row." 

This story was adapted into 
a novel by DuBose Heyward 
in 1925 and became a best~ 
seller. Heyward also wrote the 
libretto and lyrics for the 

by arthur 8alazar 

Gershwin opera adaptation. 
His people talk in a dialect 
called "Gullah," a blend of 
West Indian, Jamaican, and 
slave lingoes unique to the 
Charleston area. 

Director O'Brien says 
"Gershwin went down to 
Charleston, got as close to the 
blacks as he could, and started 

taking things down. For 
instance, there's a beautiful 
sequence in the second half 
( of the opera) where the black 
merchants come into the 
ghetto and they sell their 
wares in the morning. They 
sell strawberries, crabs, 
flowers, all things. The 
strawberry lady sings to the 
crab man." Demonstrating, 

. O'Brien sings in dialect. 
"They're sooo fresh and fiene! 
And they're jeeust off of the 
vi~ah~hine! Strahberries!" He 
continues, "she sings this 
extraordinary thing in this 

mezzo~sorprano that's very 
famous." 

The show had never been 
produced in its entirety in its 
history before O'Brien 
resurrected it. O'Brien says, 
"(Gershwin) wrote this big~ 
assed opera, and because he 
was a Broadway composer he 
got a Broadway producer. The 
opera companies wouldn't 
touch the thing with a 10~foot 

pole. No one had ever heard 
of such a thing. So instead of 
the 54 people in the orchestra 
that they needed and that we 
have, they had 27 in the pit; 
instead of 36~38 in the chorus 
they had 14. They did what 
they could and some of the 
singers couldn't cut it. It was 
simply too intense. So they 
cut things out that they 
couldn't handle, and what hit 
New York was still an opera 
but it wasn'tthe opera the way 
he wrote it. And then, it got 
mixed reviews, it closed, he 
died, (and) it was revived 
eight years later." 

O'Brien continues, "When 
they went on to do 'Porgy' the 
second time, they took out all 
the recicitavo (the music 
behind spoken dialogue) and 
just let the people speak. 
When I did the show in 1976 
in Houston (and then in New 
York's Radio City Music 
Hall) all of the song 
recicitavos were put back in,

out of town, when he couldn't 
have people sing it, were put 
back in, a symphony 
orchestra played it and an 
opera house produced it, and 
it turned out to be this 
unbelie~able experience." 

O'Brien says, "(Gershwin) 
studied a lot of European jazz 
masters." He comments, 
"here was a Jew, the principle 
song writer in America at the 
time, and he writes this 
enormously passionate 
(opera) about the black 
people in Carolina, but he 
writes it from the point of 
view also as an American 
'tunesmith.' So there's these 
popular songs that jazz artists 
perform 'It Ain't ' 
Necessarily So, ' 'I Loves You 
Porgy,' 'There's a Boat That's 
Leavin' Soon for New York' 
- in addition to which there's 
all this operatic quality, 
European romanticism, a 
blend of Folk music, of black 
themes, and of his own 
popular stuff. It's passionate, 
it's sex.', it's heartbreaking, 
it's very uplifting! The work is 
viscera!."

O'Brien wants students to 
see this show. He feels it is an 
opportunity to influence one 
of the country's most 
important artists. Writing to 
him in care of the Old Globe 
Theatre, where he is Artistic 
Director, and letting him 
know what you liked and 
what you didn't like is also 
suggested. "What the guys 
that you go to school with like 
may have some influence on 
the way I select my material," 
said the great one from his 
office in Balboa Park. 

This production will tour 
fourteen different opera 
houses around the country.
