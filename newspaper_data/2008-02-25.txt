not to come here,” Smith said. “We 
simply tell people to use caution 
when they do come here. Don’t go 
into unknown areas. Basically, use the 
same common sense you would use 
in any given city in the U.S.”

Although the kidnapping cases 
mostly involve older persons with 
citizenship in both the United States 
and Mexico, people not fitting into 
the target demographic should also 
be careful, Smith said.

Those who take frequent trips to 
Mexico should be aware that crimi-
nal activity around the border has 
increased dramatically over the past 
year, according to a recent advisory 
from the U.S. consulate in Tijuana. 

The consulate issued a “warden 
message” last month to warn all 
American travelers of the increase in 
the crime rate along the border. There 
were 22 kidnappings of American cit-
izens this past year, twice the number 
of kidnapping cases in 2006.

Though some of the victims 
were recovered, others were physi-
cally abused and even killed. In sev-
eral cases, ransom demands were also 
made.

There is no apparent pattern to 
the kidnappings, nor are all kidnap-
pings conducted by the same crimi-
nal group, according to a statement 
from the FBI Border Liaison Office 
in San Diego.

Border Liaison Office Supervisor 
Eric Drickersen said in the statement 
that there were few cases in which the 
target was randomly selected.

Despite Delays, Most of Price Center to Open Next Month

By Vanessa Do
Senior Staff Writer

Most of the much-anticipated 
Price Center expansion will be com-
pleted by early next month, if UCSD 
can secure approval from the fire 
marshal and construction conditions 
are favorable during the next two and 
a half weeks.

According to University Centers 
Director Paul Terzino, March 10 will 
mark the opening of the first level, 
which includes general indoor din-
ing seating, lounge seating, computer 
labs, study rooms and lockers; the 
third level, which will be comprised 
of student organization offices; and 
the fourth level, which will house 
offices for A.S. councilmembers and 
meeting rooms.

“A project this large and complex 
usually finishes in stages,” Terzino 
said in an e-mail. “The second floor, 
including the Ballroom, Alumni 
Association and Cross-Cultural 
Center will be completed within 

weeks after the initial opening.” 
Because the expansion team had 

originally expected to open Price 
Center’s doors at the beginning of 
Winter Quarter, events had already 
been scheduled in the Loft, the night-
club performance space and social 
lounge.

University Events Office Director 
Martin Wollesen said that ArtPower! 
had scheduled the Tentacle Sessions 
and FilmPower! scheduled its Teeny 
Tiny Film Series in the Loft, which 
had to be moved to different venues 
such as Porter’s Pub and the California 
Institute for Telecommunications and 
Information Technology.

However, Wollesen said he knew 
that the Loft might not be com-
pleted by the projected date, and had 
already made backup plans to house 
the events. 

Terzino said that because the proj-
ect is so large, there are numerous 
reasons why the completion date has 
been delayed. 

“In the case of both the Price 
Center and Student Center, the origi-
nal architectural plans specified util-
ity conditions that were incomplete 
and inaccurate,” he said. “A signifi-
cant amount of additional work had 
to be done to work around these con-
ditions, which created delays.”

Grand opening of new 
campus hub scheduled 
for end of April, though 
majority of project should 
be finished in March.

The University of California filed 
an unfair labor practice charge with 
the Public Employment Relations 
Board against the American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal 
Employees last week, citing concerns 
regarding patient safety at UC medical 
centers and claiming that the union is 
not bargaining in good faith.

The charge is a response to a tem-
porary restraining order that AFSCME 
filed against the university earlier this 
month, after campus security threat-
ened to arrest individuals distributing 
union leaflets at the UC San Francisco 
Medical Center.

Nicole Savickas, coordinator of 
Human Resources and Labor for 
the UC Office of the President, said 
the union violated Article One of its 
access agreement with the university, 
which states, “AFSCME will abide 
by the reasonable access rules and 
regulations promulgated at each cam-
pus/laboratory.”

She said that the university has 
received complaints from patients at 
UCSF and UCLA medical centers who 
claim they have been harassed.

“Access policies are laid out with 
respect to patients and their families 
to provide them unfettered access to 
the medical centers,” Savickas said. “In 
order to provide the standard of care 
we are known for, we have to uphold 
these policies.”

In addition, she said the union’s 
decision to go directly to court to 
prevent university intervention in 
its activities demonstrated bad faith 
bargaining, and that it should have 
taken its complaints to PERB, which is 
responsible for regulating access issues 
and bargaining conduct.

Anne Swinburn, a researcher for 
AFSCME Local 3299, said that Article 
One simply refers to meetings with 
union members, not communication 
with the public. She said the universi-
ty’s charge is simply an attempt to limit 
free speech, and that PERB has noth-
ing to do with this issue.

“They’re basically saying that we 
signed our free speech rights away 
when we signed up with a union,” 
Swinburn said. “Our free speech with 
the public is governed by the California 
Constitution, not PERB.”

UCSD Cancer 
Center Works 
on Possible 

Leukemia Cure
By Smruti Aravind
Senior Staff Writer

UCSD’s Rebecca and John 
Moores Cancer Center is one step 
closer to finding a cure for chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia, the most 
common form of leukemia found 
in adults.

Earlier this month, a research 
team led by Thomas J. Kipps, a 
professor of medicine, published its 
study on the use of gene therapy to 
activate the immune system against 
leukemia cells. During their research, 
Kipps and his colleagues found that 
autoantibodies could be produced 
against leukemia cancer cells and 
that certain antibodies react with a 
particular embryonic protein, the 
exact function of which they were 
able to isolate. 

The protein, ROR1, is active dur-
ing an early stage of human develop-
ment known as embryo genesis, but 
is then turned off. Kipps and his 
team found, however, that leukemia 
cells use this protein to advance 
their own survival.

“We wanted to find out why — 

See LEUKEMIA, page 3

Charles Smith, a public affairs 
spokesman for the consulate, said 
that the victims tend not to be typical 
tourists, but businesspeople with dual 
citizenship.

Responding to the rise in violent 
criminal activity, security around the 
border has increased since the begin-
ning of the year. For example, a new 
law enacted in January requires that 
travelers present a birth certificate or 
passport when crossing the border.

The advisory encourages that 
people take precautions when travel-
ing in unfamiliar territory such as 
being aware of suspicious persons 
and activity and letting others know 
their travel plans ahead of time.

“Our message doesn’t tell people 

Kidnappings of American 
citizens in Mexico have 
doubled since 2006, 
prompting an increase in 
travel safety precautions.

Charge calls to question 
scope of university access 
contract in regulating 
free speech of AFSCME 
leaflet distributors.

Thousands of Students Join 
Scripps Research Platform

More than 65,000 students 
from five foreign countries and 
around the U.S. will participate in a 
world-renowned research platform 
operated by UCSD’s Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography on Feb. 
26 during Ball State University’s 
award-winning Electronic Field Trip 
program.  

The virtual trip on Scripps’ 
Floating Instrument Platform, which 
rotates 90 degrees in the open 
ocean, is part of a live, one-hour 
broadcast called “A Whale of a 
Story: A South Seas Adventure.” 
The telecast explores the 13,000-
mile, roundtrip journey that gray 
whales make each year from their 
Bering and Chukchi Seas feeding 
grounds to Baja California's lagoons 
where they breed and give birth.  

Students watching the broadcast 
in their classrooms will tour the 
facility and interact in real time 
with Scripps researchers who use 
F.L.I.P. to study whale acoustics. In 
addition, participants will journey to 
Baja’s San Ignacio Lagoon, where 
gray whale experts will point out 
whales in the protected, shallow 
water and share information about 
the animals.  

The broadcast is the culmination 
of months of activities for students 
involved in “A Whale of a Story,” 
which is one of the most successful 
virtual field trips in the program’s 
12-year history.  

The free program combines a 
television broadcast, interactive 
Web site materials and classroom 
activities to create an in-depth 
educational experience for young 

students in all 50 states and 
Australia, Canada, England, Puerto 
Rico and Switzerland.

UCSD Receives $535K for 
Staff Integration Program

San Diego County’s Aging and 
Independence Services and UCSD 
Extension have been awarded 
$535,000 to fund a pilot program 
designed to strengthen medical 
staff’s treatment of patients suffer-
ing from chronic illnesses such as 
high blood pressure, Alzheimer’s 
disease, diabetes and heart dis-
ease. 

The partnership, which also 
includes a professor at George 
Mason University in Virginia, will 
attempt to launch the online class-
es for UCSD Extension’s spring 
term.  The grant was provided by 
the California Endowment and the 
Alliance Healthcare Foundation and 
will be used to fund the program 
until June 2009.   

According to an article pub-
lished in the San Diego Business 
Journal, Evalyn Greb, chief of long-
time care integration at Aging and 
Independence Services, said that 
the program’s goal is to create a 
virtual team for each patient, from 
physicians and nurses to office staff 
and senior center employees.   

The program will facilitate the 
transition for care providers when 
patients are moved from hospitals 
to their homes or nursing homes. 

“A new culture will be realized,” 
Greb said in the article. “There 
will be a whole constellation of 
people communicating online or by 
phone and working with the same 
patient.”

what is their function?” Kipps said.
ROR1 is located on the surface 

of leukemia cells, and analyzing 
its interactions with other cellular 
structures could lead to two impor-
tant breakthroughs, according to the 
research team.

First, antibodies that are able to 
react with ROR1 can mark the cell 
for destruction. The immune sys-
tem relies on antibodies to distin-
guish malignant cells from normal 
ones — a process useless in cancer 
patients.

“Leukemia cells are like stealth 
bombers, they avoid detection by 
the immune system,” Kipps said.

If antibodies could be produced 
to bind the ROR1 on leukemia cells, 
the immune system can be acti-
vated against them. Using a gene 
therapy procedure developed at 
UCSD, Kipps’ team inserted a gene 
into CLL patients that produced the 
necessary antibodies, or what he 
referred to as “turning off the stealth 
button.”

Team Uses Protein to Target Cancerous Cells
▶ LEUKEMIA, from page 1 Secondly, because ROR1 is only 

found on leukemia cells, it can be 
used to precisely and specifically 
detect its presence even after treat-
ment or in patients suffering from 
an early stage of the disease. 

This use of ROR1 marks a depar-

ture from conventional leukemia 
treatments, in which antibodies 
bind with antigens on normal cells 
as well as cancerous ones, caus-
ing damaging side effects to already 
typically immune-suppressed leuke-

mia patients. 
Kipps, a veteran in the field of 

CLL research and UCSD profes-
sor since the early 1990s, said he 
is excited to see leukemia patients, 
who normally are unable to make 
antibodies against anything, devel-
op antibodies against their own leu-
kemia cells. 

As deputy director of the Rebecca 
and John Moores UCSD Cancer 
Center, he has conducted a number 
of studies on this particular form of 
leukemia, and treated patients from 
all over the country as well as from 
Europe and Asia.

“This study establishes UCSD as 
the go-to place for leukemia treat-
ment,” he said. 

Having published the study in the 
journal Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences, Kipps and his 
research team are looking forward 
to the possible development of CLL 
vaccines.

the university’s medical centers have 
received in the past year.

Staff turnover rates, high stress 
environments and low worker morale 
have all been items of contention in 

recent months, and union members 
— including Swinburn — believe 
that poor employee conditions lead 
to poor patient conditions. 

However, Swinburn said that 
although these issues are controver-
sial, it is inappropriate for the uni-

Lakesha Harrison said she agrees that 
the university’s attempt to link the 
issue to PERB is baseless. She said 
that she and other union representa-
tives had been distributing materials 
at all five UC medical centers for 
three weeks before any complaints 
arose, and that the distribution oper-
ations have all been “peaceful and 
pleasant,” never consisting of more 
than two or three people.

“We’re not being confrontation-
al,” Harrison said. “We’re not picket-
ing. People just take [the leaflet] and 
keep walking.”

Meanwhile, UC-AFSCME 
negotiations regarding the uni-
versity’s 11,000 patient care tech-
nical employees have lasted over 
five months, and, in a statement 
last week, the university related 
AFSCME’s leafleting to the union’s 
recent concerns about the quality 
of employee and patient care at UC 
medical centers.

The statement included a list of 
rankings and specific honors that

versity to even mention the content 
of the leaflets when making a case 
against their distribution.

“This is a clear-cut free speech 
case,” she said. “The university 
doesn’t want us to communicate 
with patients about these issues, and 
that’s why they are trying to limit our 
free speech. This is a violation of our 
fundamental rights.”

Harrison said that over the past 
few years, AFSCME has conducted 
extensive research comparing state 
wages and benefits and their effects 
on the overall level of hospital care, 
and union members believe they 
have a responsibility to publicize this 
information.

“We are not saying anything that 
we have not researched to the bone,” 
she said. “As workers, we’ve always 
known it is a problem. Now we 
finally have the research to back up 
what we’re concerned about, and the 
public has a right to know.”

who travel in the group.
“I’m afraid that if I wasn’t around, 

that my girlfriend may be raped or 
something else,” Chin said.

Chin is not the only UCSD stu-
dent with reservations about travel-
ing across the border since the news 
of increased violent activity.

“In January, I went to Tijuana for 
my birthday, even though people 
told me not to go because there 
had been shootings recently,” Earl 
Warren College sophomore Annie 
Liou said. “But my friends and I 
went anyway because we had already 
bought the tickets, and because I 
went in a group it was more ok.” 

Liou said in addition to traveling 

in a group, she and her friends take 
other precautions to ensure their 
personal safety.

“No one walks to the clubs,” she 
said. “They take the taxis because 
people know that it’s dirty and unsafe 
in Tijuana. We try to stay in the area 
where students should be going.”

tation of the new passport law, up 
to 3,000 students headed down to 
Tijuana on a given weekend.

Ray said that the safety of his 

customers is his primary concern.
“Nothing’s going to happen to 

them,” he said. “If they stay at the 
club, they’ll be fine. If they walk 
around in Tijuana, like anywhere, 
you’re just asking for trouble.”

Ray said he was not particularly 
concerned about the increase in 
kidnappings negatively impacting 
his clientele. 

“The last thing criminals are 
doing is kidnapping students, 
because they are worthless to them,” 
Ray said. “If they’re going to kid-
nap anyone, it’s going to be a rich 
Mexican citizen.”

For once, let me take a moment to say something positive about Transportation and 
Parking Services: The Arriba 
Shuttle is a pretty sweet deal. 

While almost everything else 
about T&PS may be pricey and 
inefficient, this little gem defies 
logic and offers an amazing service 
for students living off campus. The 
shuttle, which loops around three 
stops near Vons before circling back 
to Mandeville Auditorium, can 
even be tracked online — though 
it’s so conveniently frequent this 
isn’t necessary. 

The only thing T&PS should do 
to improve this service is expand 
— why doesn’t the office set up 
these efficient shuttles all over La 
Jolla, instead of just the current 
Arriba and Nobel buses? (I don’t 
even live near Arriba, I just started 
relying on the shuttle when, at 
the beginning of Winter Quarter, 
San Diego’s Metropolitan Transit 
System rerouted to avoid my stop 
entirely. I know at least a few 
Arriba passengers are in similar 
positions.)

Now leave it to UCSD students 
to ruin a good thing. Because 
the shuttle is such an awesome 
resource, it’s pretty popular, which 
unfortunately means shuttles can 
get crowded. So each morning, as 
students from all over La Jolla flock 
to the godsend on the corner of 
Arriba, the seats fill quickly, leav-
ing only an empty aisle down the 
shuttle’s center for standing passen-
gers. It appears on these occasions, 
students forget all common cour-
tesy, leaving their human decency 
at the bus’ pressurized doors. 

Allow me to introduce: Aisle-
Seat Kid. This guy always gets on 
at the first stop; think of those 
jerks who come early to lecture, 
only to grab the first or second seat 
from the aisle and thus cause every 
person after them to do the “oh, 
sorry, excuse me” dance squeezing 
uncomfortably between the back 
of the adjacent seat and the kid’s 
unyielding knees. 

These people seem to have no 
sense of reality. Do they really 
expect no one else to want those 
seats? And what is it about the 
aisle they so stubbornly prefer, that 
they’d rather have people climb 
clumsily over them? What’s worse: 
They’re usually the same tools who 
leave their backpacks sitting in the 
middle aisle for people to trip over.

Then, once every bench is filled 
and you don’t have to deal with peo-
ple’s weird seat preferences, along 
comes Little Girl, Big Backpack. 
Though she can take many forms, 
at our school she most commonly 
appears as an Asian female science 
major. 

This is a student whose only 
concern is her studies. She gets 
on the bus just as the seats have

NATIONAL NEWS — What is more 
terrifying than a school shooter? 
Not one, but an entire lecture hall 
of armed and potentially deadly stu-
dents. However, many groups nation-
wide have responded to recent school 
shootings by advocating a stronger 
presence of concealed weapons on 
campus. 

Students for Concealed Carry on 
Campus is one such group that advo-
cates changing gun laws at the state 
level.

The number of recent shootings 
has only added fuel to the guns-at-
schools fire, which was reignited after 
the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and 
State University shootings last year. 
Many states have attempted legislation 
that legalizes guns at colleges, and in 
Utah it is now legal to carry concealed 
weapons on all public campuses. 
Luckily, California — which doesn’t 
have any such legislation on the table 
and has some of the country’s strictest 
gun safety laws — isn’t about to open 
this can of worms. 

But schools in Utah and Colorado, 
where students everywhere with the 
exception of University of Colorado, 
Boulder, can carry guns, are setting a 
scary precedent for colleges nation-
wide. 

And with similar legislation pend-
ing in 10 other states, the atmosphere 
at campuses across the country might 
be very different this time next year.

Supporters of the movement to 
legalize concealed weapons on cam-

pus argue that it will make students 
safer when faced with a shooter. They 
will be able to defend themselves, 
say proponents, rather than be sit-
ting ducks. But universities are not a 
place for firearms, and by allowing all 
students to carry guns, those schools 
are opening their doors to a greater 
risk of abuse. 

By filling a lecture hall with well-
meaning, gun-toting students, schools 
are increasing the access a student with 
dangerous intentions has to weapons. 

While groups like the SCCC are 
surely advocating what they feel will 
best protect students, this seems to be 
a case of “the best laid plans.” In fact, 
the best way to protect students is to 
address the underlying problems that 
prompt school shootings in the first 
place. 

The argument over measures that 
allow students to carry concealed 
weapons is a moot one — no matter 
what the decision, this debate address-
es the symptom, not the disease. 

Like sitting in an oatmeal bath to 
treat chicken pox, even the best-case 
scenario for a room full of concealed-
weapon carrying students is still a 
sloppy, short-term fix. And what hap-
pens after the commotion clears and 
the hypothetical shooter has been shot 
by a student carrying a concealed gun? 
Even with concealed weapons on cam-
pus, the potential for school shootings 
still exists.

The only way to protect against 
school shootings is to help students 
who feel that this is even an option. 
Clearly, anyone who is willing to open 
fire on his or her peers and teach-
ers — often, random bystanders the 
shooters don’t even know — is in an 
extreme state of desperation. Instead 
of channeling energy into forming 
groups and lobbying state govern-
ments, concerned students should call 
for better mental health help at their 
own universities. 

Students Should Say Farewell, Not Hello, to Arms
In the wake of several 
campus shootings, groups 
nationwide advocate guns 
on campus. But this fails to 
address the real problems 
causing these tragedies.

In Primaries Youth Vote Packs a Punch, Finally

By Hadley Mendoza
Senior Staff Writer

NATIONAL NEWS — Well stu-
dents, looks like we finally deserve 
a hearty round of applause for 
showing up in droves and perform-
ing the civic duty that government 
leaders, celebrities and our par-
ents have been stressing for years. 
We voted! And it looks like those 
grown-ups were right after all; the 
youth vote is actually making a dif-
ference in the 2008 primary elec-
tions. 

Active participation in democ-
racy is every citizen’s fundamental 
responsibility, and students need 
to take control of their future by 
casting their vote for president, 
both in the primary race and in 
the November election. In the next 
four years current college students 
will likely graduate and begin 
working in a country led by the 
candidate chosen from these 
elections. It’s exciting to 
see students and young 
adults finally taking 
government by the 
reigns.

The young-
voter turnout 

in this year’s Iowa caucus was up 
a celebration-worthy 135 percent 
from the last presidential prima-
ry, according to 
a recent Los 
Angeles Times 
a r t i c l e . 
Not only 
was Iowa’s 
y o u t h 
excited and 
ready to visit 

the polls, young people in states 
across the country — from New 
Hampshire and Massachusetts, 
to South Carolina and Georgia, 
to Nevada and our very own 

California — also turned out 
to vote in signif-

icantly largeer 
numbers than 
in the past.

The ques-
tion is, why 
now? The 
numbers show 
that young 
people are 
turning out 

in masses to vote for Sen. Barack 
Obama (D-Ill.). And if it is Obama 
that finally convinced young people 
to drop by the ballot box, forget the 
presidency, he deserves national 
and historic recognition for bring-
ing out the youth — something 
not even P. Diddy could do with 
his Rock the Vote campaign back 
in 2004.

And it’s about time. Statistically, 
old people are diligent voters, 
while young people fail to make 
their opinions heard at the polls. 
This means that politicians govern 
with those constituencies in mind, 
forgetting the youth’s collective 
interests. If students want even the 
chance to have their concerns — be 
they education funding, stem-cell 
research or marijuana legalization 
— seriously addressed by national 
leaders, they need contribute to the 
political process. It looks like that 
finally may be happening, and if 
Obama is responsible he should be 
awarded. 

So should Obama be the next 
president of the United States? 
That’s for Americans — includ-
ing well-represented young people 
— to decide.

filled, and parks beside the third 
row. Her crime is much like that 
of Aisle-Seat Kid — she makes 
you climb past her and her giant, 
growth-like bag. How she picks 
her resting place is still a mystery, 
the only thing that’s clear is her 
resolve to block oncoming passen-
gers any way she can. Gripping the 
seat handle beside her, she remains 
unfazed by the stream of riders, 
and blatantly ignores the common 
courtesy, and common sense, back-
packs-off rule.

She sets the tone for the pas-
sengers immediately after her, and 
following suit the Personal-Space 
Hogs are unfortunately often the 
first standing passengers at the 
back of the bus. These are rid-
ers who, again, seem to stubbornly 
deny reality. 

They stand in a single line — 
rather than two, which the bus is 
designed to fit — about a body 
length away from one another. That 
means each Personal-Space Hog is 
costing three valuable spots on the 
shuttle. 

This might not seem like a big 
deal, but the Arriba service has 
become so popular that during 
peak times only a few passengers 
from the third stop are able to 
board. As the line to board wraps 
longer and longer around the cor-
ner and bus after bus rolls past 
only allowing a few students on, 
these hogs make their peers late 
to class or work, without a second 
thought. 

Put Your Backpack Between Your 
Feet, We’re in for a Smelly Ride

▶ SHOES, from page 4 And is it really worth it? You’re 
still standing on a cramped bus, do 
those few minutes of slightly more 
breathing room really make that 
much of a difference in your day? 
Probably not, but as bus after bus 
rolls past, waiting students have 
to deal with the consequence of 
uncontrolled tardiness. 

There you are, crammed — or 
maybe not crammed, if you’re near 
the back — onto the shuttle mak-
ing a beeline to campus, and who 
do you notice standing beside you? 
Possibly the worst offender of them 
all: Body-Odor Guy. 

Yeah, you know who I’m talking 
about. All of a sudden the reek is 
all around you, suffocating you and 
killing the air, and there he is. Arm 
lifted and grabbing the support bar 
he looks at his neighbors suspi-
ciously as if to respond to your sus-
picious looks with a guilty “wasn’t 
me.” But you know the truth. 

OK, I’ll give him the benefit of 
the doubt. Maybe he just pulled an 
all-nighter, is on his way to a mid-
term and didn’t have the chance to 
shower — it happens to all of us. 
But in these situations it’s best to 
know thyself; if you smell like ass 
don’t put your armpit in the face of 
an innocent bystander.

So please, think about your 
shuttle manners. And next time 
you’re in the back of the bus with 
an abundance of extra space, sug-
gest your neighbors move back to 
make room for more passengers 
— just make sure you’re wearing 
deodorant first.

A DROP FROM THE INKWELL By Priscilla Lazaro

Suicide is consistently the third 
leading cause of death in young people 
and a 1997 study reported that fire-
arms are used in about 19,000 suicides 
annually. Translate this to the universi-
ty — where many students experience 
bouts of depression and undergo huge 
life changes, such as moving away 
from home for the first time — and 

these tragic shootings come as less of 
a surprise. 

But arming students is not an 
appropriate solution. And schools like 
UCSD that aren’t in states dealing with 
such legislation can still take a valuable 
lesson from the terrible school shoot-
ings. Good mental health services and 
outreach for troubled students should 
be a top priority at schools across the 

nation.
Students should forget extreme 

measures, and states should forget 
dangerous legislation — the only way 
to stop school shootings and save lives 
is by making the multitude of healthy 
options clear to desperate students.

Cycling Not ‘Worthy’ of 
Campus Attention

 
Dear Editor,

I found the article “Cyclists Should 
Lose the Attitude, Find the Law” high-
ly disturbing. Firstly, the bike lanes  
throughout La Jolla (I am unaware of 
bike lane infrastructure in other parts 
of San Diego) are most unsatisfactory, 
to be blunt. They are merely thin strips 
of spare bitumen near the gutter, and 
I have found they are discontinued 
on some roads. Satisfactory turning 
lanes have not been accounted for and 
there seems to be little etiquette from 
automobile owners who give inad-
equate space to cyclists. Cyclists, in 
their attempt to do good for the envi-
ronment and for their health, run the 
gauntlet every day, and it is apparent 
that sometimes it is in their interest to 
ride in the other lanes for their safety to 
minimize the risk of being sideswiped 
and pulled beneath two tons of steel, 
since car lanes are luxuriously wide. 

It seems like the energy and power 
of the Guardian would be better spent 
trying to stand up for the real issues. 
I have only been on campus for five 
weeks and already I know of two issues 
that should but unfortunately do not 
receive adequate coverage. 

The first is the struggling organic 
Food Co-op, which seems to be per-

petually crushed under the weight 
of the university bureaucracy. It is a 
remarkable organization that pro-
vides cheap and nutritious vegan and 
vegetarian alternatives compared to 
the commercial food outlets around 
campus. UCSD should be encourag-
ing such independent enterprises on 
campus but instead seems to make it 
as difficult as possible for them to exist, 
charging excessive fees and cutting off 
essential utilities such as water without 
notice.

The other issue is mental health 
professionals on campus. Both the 
Women’s Center and the student psy-
chology organization Psi Chi have con-
ducted awareness programs in the last 
month for mental health, and at both 
events, it was made plain and clear that 
psychology and counseling services on 
campus are strained and are currently 
facing budget cuts. There can be waits 
of up to three weeks to see a counselor, 
which is an awful long time for some-
one who has welled up the courage 
to seek help for a critical problem in 
their life. Mental health issues affect 
everyone in the community, and it is 
especially potent for young UCSD stu-
dents, since suicide is the third leading 
cause of death for Americans between 
the ages of 10 and 24, according to the 
National Institute of Mental Health.

I don’t mean to deprecate the 
Guardian holistically — it is a fine pub-
lication, but there has been inadequate 

focus on important issues. These are 
the issues the writers and fellow stu-
dents who contribute to the Guardian 
should be getting angry about. If this 
periodical is going to stand by its 
motto of “The Student Voice Since 
1967,” then it should represent the real 
problems students face at this institu-
tion, however big or small.

Columnist Misunderstands 
Obama’s Political Positions

 
Dear Editor, 

I recently finished reading the 
article, “Hey Obama, Let’s Hear More 
Prose, Less Poetry!” by Jake Blanc. 
After having done so, I feel compelled 
to respond as there are many errors 
in regards to Blanc’s interpretation of 
Sen. Barack Obama’s position.

First, Blanc criticized Obama’s 
position on the War on Terror as 
being “more aggressive than that 
of President Bush.” Specifically, he 
cited the senator’s position of deploy-
ing 65,000 Army troops and 25,000 
Marines. He also cited the senator’s 
position on attacking Iran and 
Pakistan, writing, “How is threaten-
ing Iran and Pakistan with nuclear 

carnage a change from the past eight 
years of Bush’s foreign policy?"

All of these points are a clear 
misreading of the senator’s position. 
Obama has called for enlarging the 
size of the military by 65,000 Army 
troops and 25,000 Marines, not for 
their deployment. This enlargement 
is critical for a military which, many 
analysts have said, has been stretched 
too thin by both the War on Terror 
and the Iraq War. Also, the senator 
has not called for directly attacking 
Pakistan, but rather al-Qaida opera-
tives who are believed to be operating 
within the borders of Pakistan only 
if the Pakistani government contin-
ues to refuse to be more aggressive 
against these terrorist cells. The sena-
tor has also said that he would attack 
Iran only if diplomacy fails to deter 
the country from pursuing a nuclear 
weapons program. And when have 
any Democratic candidates, let alone 
Obama, called for a nuclear strike 
against Iran and Pakistan, as Blanc 
insinuates in his article?

Also, Blanc’s criticism of Obama’s 
campaign phrase “Yes We Can!” is 
simply unfounded. Just because it is 
an English translation of a popular 
Latino-American group’s does not 
mean it is plagiarized.

Finally, his criticism of the sena-
tor’s letter to the Palestinian ambas-
sador is not a callous disregard for 
the plight of the Palestinians, but 

rather a call to the Palestinians to 
turn away from terrorist tactics in 
order to achieve political ends. As 
long as Palestinian terrorists continue 
to use extremist tactics, Israel will 
always respond with excessive force 
to ensure its survival. And as long as 
Israel remains the one true democrat-
ic government in the Middle East, the 
United States must support the Israeli 
people’s desire to live free of the fear 
of terrorism.

Please, before writing an article 
that criticizes a public official’s posi-
tions, be sure to get all of your facts 
straight and to consider what other 
things he or she might actually be 
saying.

SITE SEEN Latin Chef
At Pacific Beach’s Latin Chef, there’s a little something for everyone, whether they crave simple Latin 
American dishes or a combination of cus-
tomary Asian, African and European cui-
sine fused with herbs and spices of the 
ancient Incan dynasty. That’s because the 
unique Peruvian cuisine of Latin Chef 
unites food from nearly every continent, 
blending each culture’s best dishes with the 
zest and flair of Peru to create exotic yet 
familiar meals.

Most of the food is imported from Peru, 
a country that boasts 28 of the world’s 32 
different climates, making it possible to 
grow nearly every type of fruit or veg-
etable. And it shows in the menu: black 
olives, roasted corn, red chili and deep-
fried yucca root are just some of the many 
ingredients in the dozens of dishes offered; 
even the simple appetizer of roasted and 
salted corn served in small straw baskets 
feels adventurous. Influences from Japan, 
China, the Mediterranean, Italy, France 
and Russia make each dish chock full of 
rich flavor. Try the Tallarin Verde con 
Bistec, Peruvian-style noodles with pesto 
sauce made with basil and spinach and 

served with a small portion of juicy sir-
loin steak. For more familiar dishes, the 
Arroz Cahaufa is a sure-fire favorite with 
Chinese-style fried rice featuring scram-
bled eggs, green onions and soy sauce 
served with beef, chicken or octopus and 
calamari. Just beware the small portions, 
which may be typical of Peru but are not 
customary nor expected in the lavish land-
scape of California.

The atmosphere is somewhat lack-
ing, but the earth-toned walls and warm 
lantern lights make it hospitably genu-
ine, with a small stage set up for bongo 
performers to play on busier nights and 
holidays. Small, plain wooden tables 
and golden sun-ray mirrors in assorted 
shapes, designs and colors create a homey 
feel, while small international flags rep-
resenting each of the countries featured 
in the cuisine line the window opening 
into Garnet Street. Traditional Peruvian 
music — flutes, bongos and men sing-
ing romantic Latin love songs — drifts 
lazily through the room and mingles with 
the calm hum of talkative patrons and 
unhurried waiters. 

There’s no need to make a reservation, 

as this small restaurant appears to be under 
the radar for both locals and tourists,  
squashed between several other shops and 
eateries. Latin Chef does not boast a liquor 
license, but the owner is more than will-
ing to let patrons bring their own alcohol 
— he’ll even crack open the first bottle 
for you. For the under-21 crowd, try tast-
ing outside the box and go for the Chicha 
Morada, a dark purple blend of cinnamon 
and corn that tastes like fresh pomegran-
ates and leaves a sultry aftertaste. 

The breadth of the menu is impres-
sive but the steep prices are not, and it’s 
a good idea to share plates if you’re run-
ning low on cash. Also, make sure you 
go early: the restaurant closes by 9 p.m. 
even on weekends, so a lunch outing is 
probably the best time to discover the 
ever-evolving cuisine and accommodat-
ing services of Peru.

Measuring▶ ▶ In response to steep competition and pressures to earn good grades, some students resort to cheating to meet demands for excellence.Up ▶By Vanessa Do • Senior Staff Writer Student academic misconduct, more commonly known as cheating, is not a problem unique to UCSD. During the 2006-07 academic school year, 342 allegations were made against stu-dents for cheating — a number which Academic Integrity Coordinator Tricia 
Bertram-Gallant said, “is probably less 
than 1 percent [of students who actually 
cheat.]”

Despite cheating’s severity, the annual 
number of allegations has been consistent 
for the past few years.

UCSD policy outlines several differ-
ent types of academic misconduct that 
students can commit. In the 2006-07 aca-
demic year, 31 percent of cases were 
plagiarism and 27 percent were the use of 
unauthorized aids; the remaining percent-
age was broken up into three categories: 
unauthorized collaboration, falsification/
fabrication and fraud. More specifically, 
of the 342 allegations, 30 percent of the 
cases were linked to general education 
college writing programs. 

“Catching someone who cheats has 
always been difficult in courses which 
rely on writing,” Thurgood Marshall 
College Dimensions of Culture profes-
sor Nancy Gilson said. “Before [the Web 
site Turnitin.com], we had to rely on our 
own knowledge of both the literature in a 
field and our sense of what typical writing 
at a certain stage of university sounded 
like. We catch a pretty consistent num-
ber of students. It surprises me, actually. 
Turnitin.com makes it very difficult to 
cheat.”

Depending on the form of miscon-
duct, a student’s punishment can consist 
of attending a workshop about academic 
dishonesty to suspension or expulsion. 

According to Bertram-Gallant, the 
punishment depends on the severity of 
the crime. If a student committed an 
academic misconduct that can be defined 
as fraud, which includes practices such 
as using another person to complete an 
exam, acquiring a solutions manual or 
exam from a publisher or professor, or 
submitting entire purchased papers, then 
the student could face a quarter or year 
suspension or even expulsion. 

Last year, 54 percent of students 
who admitted that they cheated were

Abdul, a University of California student studying abroad at the American University in 
Cairo, met Amir at a local club. The 
relationship was friendly and noth-
ing more, until Amir called late one 
night asking if he could come over. 
The two have now been dating for 
three weeks, and in that short time 
Abdul has discovered Amir’s curios-
ity about gay life outside of Egypt.

Currently, Amir plays bass for a 
small local band. His shows often 
run into the early hours of the morn-
ing. Lately, after his shows, he makes 
a phone call and visits his new love 
interest. Amir is not his real name 
because as an Egyptian, his lifestyle 
was, and continues to be, prosecut-
able.

“He’s really shy and curious,” said 
Abdul, describing how Amir looked 
through his belongings, books and 
pornography. “I don’t think he’s 
looked at porn before,” Abdul 
said with a smile and a laugh. 
“He was mesmerized by the vid-
eos.” 

Amir also questioned 
Abdul about his straight 
roommate. 

“He thought it was 
so strange to have 
straight friends 
who didn’t judge,” 
Abdul said.

A b d u l 
b e l i e v e s 
that none of 
Amir’s fam-
ily or friends 
suspect Amir 
is gay. The risk of 
being thrown in jail, and o f 
being ostracized from every- thing 
he knows, is a risk Amir will prob-
ably never take.

“I haven’t asked if anyone knows,” 
Abdul said. “I don’t think anyone 
knows. I don’t think anyone will ever 
know.” 

During one of their first dates, 
while watching a televised soccer 
match, they managed to sneak a 
hug after a goal was scored. Abdul 
explained that culturally, since men 
are so close, it is easy to hide such 
interactions. 

“When we walk across the street 
and he grabs my hand, I don’t know if 
it’s a boyfriend thing, or just natural,” 
he said. People in the streets wouldn’t 
judge such an action as inappropriate. 
Nevertheless, Adbul said Amir is 
“very aware of how people notice 
him.” 

On Feb.14, Amnesty International 
released a statement that four men 
were arrested in Cairo for being sus-
pected of having HIV. This recent 
arrest, according to the statement, 
br ings the total 

of suspected HIV-positive gay men 
currently in custody to 12. Of the 
men previously detained, four have 
received one-year prison sentences 
under a vague and broadly inter-
preted Egyptian law on morality and 
sexual conduct. 

Cairo has a history of persecut-
ing homosexuality. In a 2004 report,

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCUS  11

By Stephanie Tsank
Contributing Writer

To combat the brand-name con-
formism so typical of today’s young 
business world, UCSD graduate 
student Jeff Horowitz aims to sell 
men clothing that exudes creativity 
and uniqueness.

“We’re all monkeys when 
we dress up anyways, at heart,” 
Horowitz said. 

Horowitz is part founder and 
front-man of DressMonkey, an 
online business that caters to young 
male professionals, allowing the 
buyer to design and tailor their 
own blazer, from the color and fab-
ric down to the number of pockets 
and buttons. 

Horowitz usually gets up at 8 a.m., 
takes care of online DressMonkey 
orders, goes to school, crams in 
homework during lunch and comes 
back home to his La Jolla apartment 
to go over strategy and sales with 
his business partner, Coley Dale, in 
Shanghai.

“From the minute I wake up it’s 
either something school related or 
business related with a little bit of 
eating in between,” Horowitz said.  

Horowitz began as an undergrad-
uate student at Claremont McKenna 
College. Since high school, when 
receiving a C prompted Horowitz to 
switch from Spanish to Chinese lan-
guage classes, he had been attracted 
to Chinese culture. When in college, 
he always imagined going to China, 
and a trip abroad there during his 
junior year altered his future.   

Horowitz graduated from 
Claremont McKenna College in 
2003 with a degree in government, 
and although he was offered a job 

as a financial adviser in Orange 
County fresh out of school he decid-
ed, instead, to go back to China. 
Horowitz saw the move as a unique 
way to expand his knowledge of the 
world. 

“I fell in love with the country,” 
Horowitz said. “I’ve always been 
interested in the culture and the 
language and the people. It was a 
great experience for me to go into 
business there and continue speak-
ing the language and negotiate in 
Chinese.” 

Horowitz got a job at a logistics 
company in Shanghai, where he 
was the only foreigner in the entire 
business. Although he was there as a 
businessman, he could not help but 
notice the discrepancies in fashion 
between what he was used to and 
what was typical for the Chinese. 

“I got to witness a lot of interest-
ing things,” he said. “I remember 
going into work and the Chinese 
would wear suit pants with white 
socks that were coming up over 
their pant legs. It opened up my 
eyes to the differences in style. I 
wish I took pictures of them.” 

These dissimilarities in style, 
along with the custom of tailored 
clothing so typical to Chinese fash-
ion, prompted Horowitz and his 
former roommate Dale, who cur-
rently lives in Shanghai, to create 
DressMonkey. Horowitz and Dale, 
who met while they were abroad 
in China as juniors, had both gone 
back to China after their gradu-
ation in 2003. While roommates, 
they were both aspiring to become 
entrepreneurs. 

“We wanted to work for our-
selves so we said, ‘Screw it, let’s quit 
our jobs and do this,’” Horowitz 

said. 
The company began as a cloth-

ing service for friends and fam-
ily, and through advertisement and 
word of mouth, the business grew. 
People began to gravitate toward 
the concept of customizing their 
own clothes as well as the name of 
the business itself. 

The two friends created the com-
pany name while sitting on their 
couch, watching a movie. They 
zipped through possibilities such 
as Trendsetter and DressYourself; 
titles that simply did not satisfy or 
were already taken. With a slip of 
the tongue, DressMonkey was born. 
The philosophy behind the name 
is meant to encourage the young, 
conformist, cubicle-inhabiting busi-
nessman to find his unique style 
rather than relying on brand names, 
a trend that Horowitz had experi-
enced while in China — where he 
had all his suits and blazers tailor-
made.

“I felt compelled to address 
what I thought had become a grow-
ing need for young professionals 
like myself: the creation of a more 
respected and fashionably-dressed 
office monkey,” said Horowitz. 

Owning a company that custom 
designs clothing, it comes as no sur-
prise that Horowitz has dealt with 
some strange requests. For example, 
he had recently received an e-mail 
from a woman who wanted to rec-
reate a specific polyester pattern 
that her son wore in the ’70s with a 
specified insignia. 

But dealing with out-there orders 
and customers isn’t Horowitz’s only 
responsibility; he also has to do his

assigned to a workshop, 19 percent  
faced quarter-long suspensions and 
3 percent faced longer suspensions 
or were permanently dismissed 
from the university.

According to Bertram-Gallant, 
cheating occurs more often at 
UCSD than other colleges in the 
area, mostly because UCSD’s quar-
ter system offers more classes and 
therefore more instances of cheat-
ing. However, Gilson attributes 
increased cheating to higher com-
petition at universities. 

“My experience in the last few 
years is that the competition in 
school, at high school and univer-
sity, is so stiff that getting anything 
less than an A is unacceptable,” 
Gilson said. “Most students do not 
set out to cheat; it happens at a 
moment of panic when they believe 
that what they have done on their 
own is not going to measure up. 
Many of them rationalize that using 
ideas from someone else or words 
or sentences from Wikipedia is not 
cheating. It’s on the Web, that makes 
it public domain, yes? Well, no. But 
then the damage is done.” 

Another common form of aca-
demic misconduct is the use of 
unauthorized materials such as 
cheat sheets, or using old lab reports, 
papers or exams to aid in the com-
pletion of a students’ homework 
— methods that Bertram-Gallant 
said are commonly perceived as less 
severe than more blatant types of 
misconduct.

“If the instructor hasn’t assigned 
the use of it, then it is considered 
cheating,” Bertram-Gallant said. 
“My ethics [are], if a professor is 
standing over your shoulder, would 
you still be doing it? If no, then 
it would be cheating. If a student 
has access to previous exams, they 
shouldn’t use it unless they ask the 
professor.” 

However, there tends to be a fine 
line between authorized and unau-
thorized aids. Organizations such 
as A.S. Lecture Notes must acquire 
the permission of a professor before 
providing lecture notes for classes. 
Art history professor Teri Sowell 
endorses A.S. Lecture Notes because 
she feels that students can focus 
their attention on larger concepts 
rather than trying to write down 
her lectures verbatim.

“Students may not understand 
what is important during the lec-
ture, so they try to record every-
thing I say,” she said. “It detaches 
them. If they can rely on good 
lecture notes, they can spend more 
time digesting and applying the 
material. I do not notice a big 

attendance drop in classes that have 
an A.S. note taker. Notes can only 
record so much and I doubt anyone 
could get an A in my class with-
out understanding the classroom 
nuances that do not get recorded in 
published notes.”

Yet not all professors feel this 
way. Political science professor 
Keith Poole does not like the use of 
A.S. lecture notes in his classes. 

“I allowed the note taker to do it 
once in one of my classes and have 
not done it since,” he said. “I do not 
think that students can learn any-
thing if they can buy notes.” 

According to Bertram-Gallant, 
because many students attend grad-
uate school after UCSD, there isn’t a 
competition between students, but 
a competition within themselves. 
Rather than contending against one 
another, the students are helping 
each other cheat, she said.

“A lot of kids come into univer-
sity with better-than-perfect GPAs,” 
she said. “So students think that 
they are better-than-perfect, which 
has many psychological effects. 
Think about how devastating that 
A-minus becomes. It’s a competi-
tion against the system, because the 
system has made grades so impor-
tant for future successes.”

Bertram-Gallant said that issues 
with academic integrity aren’t just 
threatened by students who cheat, 
but also by students who keep 
quiet when they see others cheat-
ing, which has a negative long-term 
effect.

“Professors assign grades in 
order to assign different levels of 
competence,” she said. “Students 
who are peeved that other students 
are cheating are silent; they just let 
it happen. Then it becomes nor-
mative, then the UCSD diploma 
becomes worthless.” 

Despite concerns associated with 
the violation of academic integrity, 
UCSD has not done any anony-
mous surveys regarding academic 
misconduct. Thus, there is no way 
of knowing how many students are 
engaging in behaviors that would 
be considered cheating. Bertram-
Gallant said that having this data 
would be very helpful for UCSD, 
but in the meantime, the only sta-
tistics available are on the cases of 
academic misconduct that are being 
reported.

“A cheater doesn’t just hurt 
themselves, in fact, they benefit 
themselves,” she said. “But they hurt 
everyone else — even those who 
don’t cheat.”

Amnesty International claimed to 
have the names of 179 suspected gay 
men who were arrested, beaten and 
tortured under the reach of debauch-
ery laws since 2001. The report spec-
ulated that Amnesty International’s 
figures paled in comparison to the 
actual numbers of harassed individu-
als; many harassed, suspected gay 
men are never brought to trial or 
even charged.

The most public and internation-
ally recognized crackdown in Cairo 
was in 2001, with the arrest and trial 
of several men, known now as the 
Cairo 52. The police raided a Nile 
River disco, the Queen Boat, and 
the local papers subsequently listed 
the names and personal information 
of all the men alongside labels such 
as “Satan-worshippers” and “sexual 
perverts.”

Despite the growing fear among 
Egyptian gays of the continued threat 
of violence, Abdul was not worried 
about coming to study in Egypt. A 
gay friend of his had studied in Cairo 
before, and assured Abdul that there 
was a large community there. Abdul 

encounters far more unwanted sexual 
passes than prejudiced harassment. 

“I was surprised how many people 
grab their crotch and smile at me,” 
Abdul said. “They have little signals: 
whistles and kissy lips. One time I 
did it back and had to run away.”

It was a come-on he wasn’t in the 
mood for deflecting, he said.

In addition to the presence of gay 
culture on Cairo’s streets, the online 
community continues to flourish. 
Many Web sites, such as Gayegypt.
com, are hosted abroad in places like 
the UK, but nevertheless serve a vital 
role in sustaining the underground 
network of gay life in Egypt. 

“It’s all online now, and the sites 
are all in Arabic,” said Abdul.

Even online, Abdul notices differ-
ences from American gay culture. 

“[Gay men in Egypt] always say 
they’re tops because the punishment 
for the top is less than the bottom; 
they’re less of a man in that sense,” 
he said.

Abdul said that, because of the 
aggressive nature of men in Egypt, 
most gay men in Cairo find it hard 
to accept the idea of a loving, mutu-

al relationship between two male 
adults.

Still, Abdul wants to try. Since 
he finds most men here are inter-
ested in only sexual relationships, 
he is reluctant to enter a sexual 
relationship with Amir in the hope 
that they will form a more tangible 
connection. Up to this point, they 
have been keeping things as casual 
as they can under the necessary veil 
of secrecy.

During a brief phone call with 
Amir, as he prepared for work, 
Abdul whispered softly in Arabic. 
He missed Amir, he said, and wanted 
to see him later. Certain that Amir 
looks toward a future where he lives 
a life of secrecy, married to a woman, 
raising children and likely express-
ing his hidden desires in online chat 
rooms, Abdul is eager to show him a 
life where people can be open, even 
if it’s only with each other — away 
from oppression, stereotypes and 
judgment for one’s sexuality.

homework. 
Horowitz is currently working on 

obtaining his masters degree at the 
School of International Relations 
and Pacific Studies at UCSD with 
a regional concentration on China. 
Balancing demanding schoolwork 
with small-business ownership, 
while difficult, has been a positive 
experience for Horowitz. Although 
it has taken some adjustment, he 
finds that his classmates are of the 
same business oriented mindset, 
which definitely made the transi-
tion from the business world back 
to school easier. 

And, because Horowitz prefers a 
more direct and practical approach 
to learning rather than simply 
studying theory, he believes that 
IR/PS fits him well. The curriculum 
includes classes on strategic mar-
keting, global economy, managerial 
economics and offers perspectives 
on both the micro and macro sides 

of the economy.
 Horowitz and his classmates 

work one-on-one with local compa-
nies, creating business models with 
them and working with real-life 
data sets. To Horowitz, this type 
of hands-on experience is valuable 
in anything business-related that 
he may decide to do after gradu-
ation. His regionalized program, 
in particular, combines the cul-
tural and political sides of China 
to the overall business and man-
agement training aspect, which he 
believes will surely assist him in his 
DressMonkey endeavors. 

Although Horowitz and Dale 
don’t see DressMonkey expanding 
into a separate store anytime soon, 
they are looking into partnering 
with small boutiques or showcasing 
their suits in kiosk-type arrange-
ments in New York City. They are 
also in the midst of designing cloth-
ing options for women. 

Horowitz plans to graduate this 

coming June, and although his 
future isn’t set in stone, he is con-
sidering working on DressMonkey 
full time. 

“I’d be selling myself and the 
company short if I didn’t devote my 
full time because there’s so much 
more we could do and there’s defi-
nitely room to grow,” he said. 

Despite the potential difficulties, 
Horowitz considers entrepreneur-
ship as a viable option for anyone 
with the drive and patience to make 
it happen. 

“It’s easier than you think to sort 
of build on [your] idea and per-
haps build a business based around 
[your] idea, based around [your] 
passion,” Horowitz said. “Don’t feel 
intimidated or think that this is 
something that only the smartest 
people in the world can do. That’s 
not true at all.”

14 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 2008

Jenny Tsai and Jessica Winkler of Cal 
Poly Pomona. At number three, senior 
Justine Ang Fonte teamed with fresh-
man Dalya Perelman to take out the 
Broncos duo of Mallory Brady and 
Kaitlin Woolridge. No. 2 doubles was 
just as entertaining, with freshmen 
Kimmi Dao and Valerie Tang holding 
off Kara Fisher and Fallon Blattner, 
8-6.

The Tritons made things much less 
interesting once singles started, winning 
five of the six matches in straight sets. In 
the only three-setter, which was the 
No. 2 singles match, Perelman rode a 
wave of tremendous shots to blow right 
by Winkler after a rough first set to 
win 1-6, 6-1 (10-1). Every other match 
was routine, with UCSD posting some 
crooked scores in a thorough beating of 
the Broncos. Varnay was perfect in the 
fourth spot, beating Fisher 6-0, 6-0. At 
number six, junior Tessa Tran was just 
as dominating in the first set, beating 
Michelle Stock, 6-0, 7-5. Dao won her 
match at the top spot over Tsai, 6-2, 
6-3, while Fonte defeated Brady at the 
number three spot by a 6-2, 6-1 score. 
Senior Molly Sullens won at the No. 5 
spot, taking out Woolridge, 6-1, 6-2.

The Tritons’ first conference game 
of the early season was on Feb. 9 when 
they hit the road to face Cal State 
Bernardino. UCSD looked great in the 
match, dominating in both singles and 
doubles and winning 8-1. All three 
doubles matches were won 8-1, and 
the singles was barely as competitive. 
Junior Ina Dan and Bains won at the 
top doubles pot, beating Jennifer Joy 
and Leslie Horn. At No. 2, Dao and 
Tang proved to be too much for Xinia 
Chaves and Ashley Hulett. Fonte and 
Perelman combined to beat Brittany 
Choate and Kara Jenkins in the last 
doubles spot.

Cal State San Bernardino’s only win 
of the day came at the top singles match, 
when Joy managed to get by Dan in an 
exciting three-setter. After the first set, 
Joy and Dan played neck and neck over 
the next two sets, but Joy managed to 
make a few more shots to escape. The 
3-6, 6-4, (14-12) win was easily the best 
match of the day.

There wouldn’t be much else for the 

Coyotes to be excited about. Beginning 
at number two singles, a 6-1, 6-1 vic-
tory by Dao over Leslie Horn, CSUSB 
looked simply overmatched by the 
Tritons. Perelman won her match 6-0, 
6-0, over Hulett at the third spot, and 
Sullens beat Chaves, 6-3, 6-0 at the 
fourth spot. Varnay nearly had another 
double bagel, and cruised to an easy 
win over Choate, 6-0, 6-1. In the final 
singles match, Tran was able to make it 
two double bagels for UCSD on the day, 
with a 6-0, 6-0 win over Jenkins.

It’s clear from the Tritons’ early 
results in conference that they should 
be a force in the national championship 
hunt, but with nonconference losses to 
Cal State Northridge on Feb. 13 and 
Fresno Pacific on Feb. 15, UCSD has 
much room for improvement.

LaPlante was hesitant to jump to 
conclusions and said  that the road to a 

title is still extremely imposing.
“BYU Hawaii, the defending nation-

al champion, will be very difficult to 
beat, but I believe we have a stronger 
team this year than we did last year,” 
she said. “By the end of the season, I 
think our team will finally be a cohe-
sive unit, and the newcomers will be 
integrated with the veterans. We should 
be in good shape towards being one of 
the two best teams in the region, and 
advancing to Nationals in Houston.”

UCSD will be busy this week with 
three road matches, first facing point 
Point Loma Nazarene University on 
Feb. 27. Two days later, UCSD will 
travel north, where they will play 
CCAA opponent Sonoma State, fol-
lowed by UC Davis on Mar. 1.

Tritons Cruising Through League Schedule
▶ TENNIS, from page 16

ERIK JEPSEN/GUARDIAN
Freshman Dalya Perelman needed three sets to take care of her Cal Poly Pomona opponent on Feb. 23.

fan, I have no doubt they will be the 
cellar-dwellers the entire season with a 
chance to lose 100 games unless young 
studs Matt Cain and Tim Lincecum can 
each win 15 one-run games. 

The top four spots are a free-for-
all, with each team capable of putting 
together a great season. As we saw last 
year, two teams could make the playoffs 
out of the West and chances are the divi-
sion title won’t be decided until the final 
weekend. I’ll take the Diamondbacks, 
who became the favorites when they 
acquired Dan Haren to create a for-
midable 1-2 punch with sinker-baller 
Brandon Webb and last year’s All-Star 
game starter Haren. Arizona also has a 
ton of prospects that showed promise 
last year and will only improve as they 
mature in their peak baseball years. 

The defending league champion 
Rockies should be able to grab the Wild 
Card again, maybe this time without the 
heartbreak for Trevor Hoffman and the 
Padres, thanks to their amazing offense 
led by Matt Holiday, Todd Helton, Troy 
Tulowitzki and Garrett Atkins. 

As for San Diego’s own Padres, the 
team continues to do just enough offen-
sively to compete but not dominate. 
With amazing pitching in Jake Peavy 
and Chris Young, the Padres don’t need 
much, but outside of Adrian Gonzalez, 
the Friars are a bunch of streaky hitters. 
Mike Cameron’s departure rids the team 
of one inconsistent, strikeout-prone 
and, now, suspended player, but Khalil 
Greene does not provide Gonzalez with 
the lineup protection he needs for the 
Padres to be a force in the West. 

The Dodgers are capable of being 
relevant in September and have a bright 
future with youngsters Matt Kemp and 
James Loney, but old-timers Nomar 
Garciaparra and Jason Schmidt must go 
and Andruw Jones isn’t capable of 35+ 
homers or a .250 average anymore.

The NL Central is nowhere near 
as competitive as the West and looks 
to be a two-team race between the 
big-spending Cubs and the powerful 
Brew Crew. Milwaukee nearly made the 
playoffs behind Prince Fielder’s father-
hatred-fueled season and new hero to 
the Jewish people Ryan Braun’s tremen-
dous rookie season. That middle-of-
the-order combination alone can keep 
the Brewers within range of the Cubs, 
who are my pick for the division title. 

Lou Piniella may need to kick some 
dirt and throw a base on Opening Day 
to keep the Cubs motivated from the 
get-go but the team will get a lot better 
with Alfonso Soriano playing a whole 
season and the arrival of Japanese 
import Kosuke Fukudome. Besides 
their talented pitching staff and solid 
one through eight lineup, the Cubbies 
also seem like candidates for a 2004 Red 
Sox-esque curse-ending World Series 
win. With more than $200 million 
spent in the past two offseasons, now is 
the time for the Cubs to back up Ryan 
Dempster’s bold prediction and be rid 
of the Steve Bartman aftertaste. 

The Cardinals’ lineup looks bad with 
one of the game’s best hitters in Albert 
Pujols penciled in. But  he looks des-
tined for the disabled list when his elbow 
inevitably blows out, which would put 
St. Louis’ offense on the Giants’ anemic 
level. The Astros could put up some nice 
numbers with Lance Berkman, Carlos 
Lee and new acquisition Miguel Tejada 
— the Mitchell Report-exposed and 
injury-prone shortstop who is in the 
twilight of his career. But without any 
proven pitchers beyond Roy Oswalt, 
Houston will be limited to playing spoil-
er in September. 

The Reds have more promising tal-
ent in their system than any team in the 
majors, but Joey Votto, Homer Bailey 
and Jay Bruce all look at least a year 
away from realizing their potential and, 

therefore, Big Red looks destined for 
another fourth-place finish. Picking up 
the rear will be the Pirates, who have 
been rebuilding for a decade now and 
seem to have made no progress. 

No one takes the NL seriously, but 
there is a real possibility that the 2008 
World Series champions come out of the 
NL East. While the defending division 
champion Phillies have a talented team 
and Ryan Howard is one of the most 
exciting players in the game, the Mets 
got immeasurably better with the addi-
tion of the unanimous choice for best 
pitcher in the game, Johan Santana. New 
York hardly gave up anything in the deal 
to acquire the two-time Cy Young win-
ner and with Jose Reyes, David Wright 
and Carlos Beltran anchoring the lineup, 
the Mets don’t even need Santana and 
the rest of their stellar staff to be lights 
out to win a ton of ballgames. The Mets 
should win at least 90 games and is capa-
ble of the 100-win milestone barring a 
crippling collapse like the one that cost 
them a playoff appearance last year. 

The Phillies have a lineup, with 
Howard, Chase Utley and Jimmy 
Rollins, capable of trading runs with the 
Mets, but have starting pitching prob-
lems outside of Cole Hamels. Even if 
Hamels can outperform Santana in a 
matchup of aces, the Mets have Pedro 
Martinez, John Maine and Oliver Perez 
waiting after Santana to win any series. 

The Phillies should compete with 
the Brewers and Rockies for the NL 
Wild Card but have no chance of pull-
ing off the comeback they did last year 
to win the division. After the Mets and 
Phillies, the Braves should be just good 
enough to take third and finish over 
.500, but not to contend with the top 
dogs. Washington and Florida will battle 
for fourth place with only fantasy players 
interested in Hanley Ramirez’s produc-
tion paying attention to either team’s 
meaningless seasons.

CSUSB out of first place,” Osier said.
Osier led all scorers with 30 points 

and Noud added 27 points. UCSD 
also held Cal State San Bernardino’s 
center Vanessa Wilt to only seven 
points in the game. The win gave 
the Tritons a season sweep over the 
Coyotes and dropped Cal State San 
Bernardino into second place.

“We played a phenomenal defensive 
game,” Elliott said. “It was only the sec-
ond time all year that [Wilt] didn’t have 
a double-double.”

The Tritons will take to the road for 

their last two regular season contests 
against Cal State Monterey Bay on Feb. 
28 and San Francisco State University 
on Feb. 29. These games are important 
for UCSD, which needs to be one of the 
top four seeds in the first round of the 
CCAA tournament in order to host its 
first-round contest.

“We’re still in good shape,” Elliott 
said. “We need to take care of business in 
our next games and have some momen-
tum heading into the tournament.”

the doubleheader and pulled out a gutsy 
6-5 win. The Tritons, who mustered 
only five hits in the first-game loss, got 
a four-hit performance from freshman 
outfielder Katrin Gabriele to secure the 
nonconference split. The prestige of 
their opponent’s Division I standing 
did not intimidate the Tritons, who 
marched into the game knowing they 
were the team to beat.

“We knew going in that we were just 
as good if not better than they were,” 
sophomore catcher Nicole Saari said. 
“The fact that they’re D-I wasn’t a big 
deal; we had beaten them before so we 
knew we were going to compete with 
them. It was good to see our bats come 
alive in the second game and come 
together for a good win.”

Junior first baseman Jenni Habib 
agreed that the win’s significance was 
not that it came against a Division-I 
team but that it came on the heels of a 
loss, showing the team’s resilience and 
determination.

“What was more exciting than just 
playing a D-I team was seeing the bats 
come alive in the second game,” Habib 
said. “We didn’t let the loss in the first 
game get to us and we answered back.”

The 2008 UCSD squad is stocked 
full of quality bats, but so far this 
year has not been able to fully meet 
their self-imposed standards. The 
Tritons have a season record of 14-4 
(4-2 CCAA), but believe that some 
of those losses could have been 
erased with more consistent hitting 
to back up their stellar pitching and 
defense. 

“Our offense is still not where we 
think it should but I think that little by 
little we’re getting there,” head coach 
Patti Gerckens said. “We’re starting to 
get more runs so we’re doing okay. I 
feel that our offense is going to come 
around so I’m very optimistic. [The 
second University of San Diego game] 
was good because instead of just wish-
ing and hoping for runs, they went out 

and made it happen and that’s what we 
need to keep doing.”

After the series-opening games on 
Friday versus Cal State Dominguez 
Hills were postponed due to the rain, 
the skies finally cleared up on Saturday 
just long enough for the Tritons to 
complete their scheduled doublehead-
er. In the first game, UCSD put up 
three runs over the first four innings 
but could not extend its lead to put 
the game out of reach and allowed 
the Toros to tie in the top of the fifth 
inning. With the score tied at three, 
senior outfielder Danielle Bundy dou-
bled to left, leading off the bottom of 

the sixth. Junior centerfielder Allison 
May moved Bundy to third with a 
sacrifice bunt, but Gabriele was unable 
to repeat her magic from earlier in 
the week and flied out to shallow cen-
ter. With two outs and the go-ahead 
runner on third base, senior second 
baseman Danielle Lukk came through 
with a clutch RBI single up the middle 
to score Bundy from third and seal 
the win. Sophomore pitcher Christine 
Zankich tossed two and two-thirds 
scoreless innings in relief to pick up 
her second win of the year.

Game two on Feb. 23 saw more of 
the same from the Tritons, who put 
up a four spot in the fourth inning but 
again allowed the Toros to creep back 

into the game. UCSD gave up three 
runs in the middle innings while cling-
ing to a 4-3 lead. Their batters woke up 
again in the sixth inning as senior 
third baseman Jenny Maze crushed a 
solo homerun that easily cleared the 
center field wall for a crucial insurance 
run that led to the Tritons’ eventual 5-
3 victory. In the game, junior starting 
pitcher Lauren Chastain improved her 
record to 6-0 and Zankich notched her 
second save. 

The doubleheader sweep was 
important, especially amid all the 
rainouts, but the UCSD hitters still 
know that they have more to show for 
themselves. They are determined not 
to be satisfied simply with winning 
— they want to dominate.

“We definitely wanted to beat [Cal 
State Dominguez Hills] by more than 
just a few runs but they were fighters 
and they got back into the game,” Saari 
said. “We got some runs early on but 
we needed to score even more runs 
later in the game. A win’s a win and 
that’s great, but we knew that we could 
beat them by more.”

Maze’s homerun was her third of 
the year and the 28th of her career. 
Even though every homerun she hits 
extends her own all-time UCSD record, 
the slugger insists that she steps up to 
the plate with the same basic mindset 
of getting quality base hits.

“Right now I’m just trying to hit 
the ball on the ground and make 
good contact,” Maze said. “If it clears 
the fence, that’s cool, but I’m just 
trying to get on base and help the 
team. We have our mechanics down 
and we’re super close to putting it all 
together. We’re right there so we have 
confidence that it will come together 
soon.” 

Next the Tritons will travel to play 
Cal State San Bernardino for a four-
game series starting on Feb. 29.

trying to find the right combo of guys.”

The Tritonss battled against Lewis 
in all four games, but late runs proved 
UCSD’s demise yet again. Sophomore 
Jason Spangler pounded 25 kills, but 
it wasn’t enough as the Flyers took the 
match 30-27, 27-30, 30-25, 30-27.

Game one witnessed 15 ties and five 
lead changes as both teams fought for 
breathing room. The Tritons opened up 
the first real advantage 22-20 on senior 
Russ Hardy’s kill. But Lewis responded, 
taking the lead 23-22 and scoring five 
of the next eight to cruise to the win.

The Tritons responded in game two, 
using a late 4-1 run in the tight contest 
to open up a 25-22 advantage. In a game 
that had 14 ties and five lead changes, 
UCSD used a late run to steal game two 
just like Lewis did in game one.

Knotted up at one game apiece, the 
Flyers took off in game three, opening a 

17-9 lead and soaring to an easy victory. 
Game four was closer, but Lewis main-
tained control throughout, as UCSD 
wasn’t able to put any run together.

The Tritons couldn’t dwell on the 
loss for long as the Ramblers downed 
UCSD 30-25, 30-26, 29-31, 30-22. 

Down by three in game one, UCSD 
pulled within 23-22 before the Ramblers 
rolled to the win with a four-point run. 
Game two wasn’t much different as the 
Tritons were within three late, but a 
Loyola-Chicago run later, UCSD had 
dug itself a two-game deficit.

The Tritons stormed out to a 25-21 
lead in game three until the Ramblers 
went on their usual late game run. This 
time UCSD had a larger cushion and 
two Spangler kills closed out the game.

In game four, Loyola-Chicago scored 
11 of 15 early to lead by seven. The 
advantage reached as many as 10 before 
the Ramblers closed out the game.

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 2008

Senior Staff Writer

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — One 
night after beating a team tied for 
first place in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association, the Tritons suf-
fered a loss 
to a seventh-
place team to 
stay in a tie 
for third place 
in conference. 
UCSD put together a convincing 66-
56 win at Cal State San Bernardino 
on Feb. 23, dropping the Coyotes into 
second place in the CCAA. The Tritons 
followed up that game with a 72-55 
loss to Cal Poly Pomona University on 
the road on Feb. 24, in a game where 
UCSD led by as many as 11 points in 
the first half but let a win slip away.

The Tritons started out the game 
well against Cal Poly Pomona, taking 
a 14-7 lead off senior guard Alexis 
Mezzetta’s free throws with 13:40 left 
in the half. Jump shots from senior 
forward Meaghan Noud and junior 
forward Michelle Osier as well as free 
throws from sophomore guard Laura 
Moore extended UCSD’s lead to 22-11. 

The Broncos would not go down 
easily, as they rallied back before the 
half. Cal Poly Pomona cut the Triton 
lead to 33-29 at the half, as UCSD 
could not head into the break on a 
good note.

The Broncos’ momentum from the 
first half continued  into the second. 
Cal Poly Pomona quickly tied the game 
at 35 less than five minutes into the half 
and a three-pointer gave the Broncos 
their first lead of the game at 40-37. 
UCSD retook the lead on an Osier 
jumper midway through the second 
half, but the Broncos quickly recovered 
and took control of the game.

Cal Poly Pomona took a 10-point 
lead with 4:18 left, sealing the loss for 
the Tritons and handing UCSD its sixth 
conference loss of the year.

“[The Broncos] had 18 offensive 
rebounds in the game,” head coach 
Charity Elliott said. “We gave them 
extra opportunities that we didn’t need 
to give them.” 

Led by Osier and Noud, the Tritons 
had different results in their game 
against Cal State San Bernardino. 
UCSD started out the game in an 8-0 
hole before Osier’s layup put the Tritons 
on the board with 16:20 left. Noud and 

Osier took turns hitting shots for the 
Tritons, and Noud’s three-pointer with 
7:22 left in the half gave the Tritons a 
18-16 lead — their first of the game.

The teams fought hard in the last 
several minutes and UCSD ended up 
taking a 25-24 lead going into the break. 
Osier and Noud combined to score 20 
of the Tritons’ 25 points in the half.

The Tritons and Coyotes played 
a close beginning of the second half 
with the Tritons, holding onto a slim 
lead throughout. Noud’s fourth three-
pointer of the game gave the Tritons a 
little bit of separation from the Coyotes, 
pushing their lead to nine points with 

11:56 left in the contest. 
With Osier and Noud continuing to 

score basket after basket for the Tritons, 
UCSD’s defense was able to hold off 
Cal State San Bernardino’s center and 
best player to give the Tritons a strong 
chance at winning. With the Tritons 
still holding onto the lead in the last few 
minutes of the game, the Coyotes were 
unable to knock their shots down and 
UCSD was able to convert on its free 
throws to give the Tritons a 66-56 win. 

“The game was an accomplish-
ment especially since we knocked

Tritons Take Two From TorosVolleyball’s 
Trip to Illinois 
Ends With Two 
More Losses

By Matt Croskey
Senior Staff Writer

VOLLEYBALL — The weekend didn’t 
go as well as expected for UCSD, as 
it suffered two losses in Romeoville, 
Ill. Both Lewis University and Loyola-
Chicago University got the better of 
UCSD, sending the Tritons into a sea-
son-long, five-game losing skid.

The losses drop the Tritons’ record 
to 4-12 overall and keep them search-
ing for a swagger they had against UC 
Irvine over a month ago. Since the vic-
tory over the reigning national champi-
ons, UCSD has lost nine of 11.

Head coach Kevin Ring said that 
the team went into the weekend with 
high hopes of getting back on track.

“We played a couple of tough MPSF 
matches against Pepperdine and USC 
last week and we were competitive this 
week,” he said. “Right now we have oe 
or two guys having a good night, but 
not all six. The next night it will be 
reversed. We’re really working in prac-
tice to become more consistent.”

Ring said the blocking game needed 
improvement, a weakness that was obvi-
ous over the weekend. In the matches 
against Lewis and Loyola-Chicago, the 
Tritons were out-blocked 37-18.

“It’s not a matter of height but expe-
rience,” he said. “Loyola and Lewis

SOFTBALL — During a week of

CCAA FOES 
FALL TO 

DOMINANT 
TRITONS

By Neil Joshi
Staff Writer

WOMEN’S TENNIS — The Tritons 
haven’t lost a game in CCAA play since 
April 2003 — a remarkable streak of 
42 matches — and with a deep and 
resilient squad this season, UCSD is 
poised to continue its success and make 
it five perfect seasons in a row. Early in 
the spring season, UCSD hasn’t dis-
appointed, going 3-2 overall, with a 
perfect 2-0 mark in league play. Head 
coach Liz LaPlante’s team has had two 
of their last three scheduled matches 
canceled due to rain, but in the middle 
of the interrupted matches, UCSD took 
out league rival Cal Poly Pomona 9-0 
on the road over the weekend.

Now in her 29th season, LaPlante 
has been blessed with seven freshman 
newcomers, a crew that has made 
things interesting in the Triton lineup.

“I am extremely impressed with the 
new freshmen,” LaPlante said. “They 
are definitely the strongest group of 
players I’ve ever had all come at the 
same time. I think all of them will 
impact the top eight in a competitive 
manner, and make it tough to deter-
mine who will be playing match in and 
match out.”

The Triton’s tremendous depth will 
make them a tough foe for any team in 
the CCAA, and they have no intention 
of relinquishing their impressive streak.

Among its dangerous competi-
tors, LaPlante mentioned Cal Poly 
Pomona as a conference threat during 
the preseason, but was sure her team’s 
extraordinary depth would be enough 
to prevail. Her team had little trouble 
with the Broncos on Feb. 23, tough-
ing out three grueling doubles matches 
to take a 3-0 lead, then sweeping the 
singles to get the perfect victory. Both 
No. 1 and No. 3 doubles nearly went 
the distance, ending at 9-7. At the top 
spot, two freshmen, Natalie Varnay and 
Taskeen Bains, notched their first win 
as a doubles team when they defeated 

Rain turns three-day, 
four-game series into 
just a doubleheader on 
Feb. 23, in which UCSD 
takes both games.

Tight Races
The San Diego rains may suppress the feeling that springtime has come, but in my world, spring 
starts as soon as pitchers and catchers 
report to spring training to signal the 
start of a new baseball season.

The shadow of steroids will hang 
over the sport as long as liars and cheat-
ers continue to be exposed and until the 
union gives in to blood testing. But the 
2008 season has enough young stars 

— power hitters that are juice-free and 
promising pitchers poised to tame aging 
sluggers — and storylines to distract us 
from congressional hearings that pro-
vide no closure beyond B-12 excuses.

With that in mind, I’m proud to 
present predictions for an exciting 
season even though opening day is 
more than a month away.  Since Roger 
Clemens and Barry Bonds will not find 
new homes other than prison cells, 
most teams’ rosters are pretty set so 
now’s the time for a fearless forecast. 
In this issue, the National League will 
be dissected and the American League 
and postseason predictions will follow.
