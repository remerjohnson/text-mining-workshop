Library Proposal 
Submitted to saxon 
Panel OKs Plan to Store 
25 % of UC Library Books 

ASUCSD Holds First Meeting Tuesday 
by Mark Stadler 
Managing Editor 

A statewide library committee Monday approved the UC Library 
Reorganization .Plan, under which 25 percent of all the books in UC 
campus libraries will eventually be placed in two large regional storage 
facilities. 

-Council Begins Action on 1977-78 'Budget The Library Policy Steering Committee voted to send the plan, with 
several minor changes, to UC Academic Vice-president Donald Swain, 
and President Saxon for their approval. Saxon in the past has indicated 
his approval for the proposal. 

by Reed Alpert 
Staff Writer 

An atmosphere of "learning the 
ropes" filled the first ASUCSD 
Council meeting Tuesday night as 
most of the council members ~ot 
their first taste of parliamentary 
procedure. 

The council, however, did pass 
two bills and began action-on 'the 
Student Activity Fee (SAF) Budget 
for next year. 

The first bill passed was suD-
mitted , by Bob Drapeau, Com-
missioner of External Affairs. 

concerning the UC Student Lobby 
internships for this summer. The 
second bill, submitted by Barry 
Hyman, Commissioner of Student 
Welfare, directs Hyman to act as a 
Student Advocate and assist 
students who are charged with 
violations of University 
regulations or have grievances 
against the University. (Triton 
Times, May 20.) 

ASUCSD President Jeff Leifer 
and Activity Board Chair, James 
Atkins, will make recom-
mendations to the council at its 
next meeting on procedure to set 

up a finance committee. The 
committee will look into the $31,563 
SAF Budget and decide how the 
funds will be allocated to the 
various student organizations. 

Results of Referendum 

A third bill was presented by 
Jonathan Osborn, Third College 
Co1JJlcil member, but was returned 
to him by the Council so it could be 
rewritten "more specifically. " The 
bill concerned the results of the 
Comprehensive Referendum 
submitted to the students in the 
past ASUCSD election. 

UCSD literature professor, Andy Wright, who is on the committee as 
chairman of the statewide Academic Senate Library Committee, cast the 
only vote against the plan. 

Not in Final Form 

Next Year's Campus-Wide 
.Committee Positions Open 

The ASUCSD Council consists of 
three representatives from each of 
the four colleges, nine com-
missioners and is chaired by Mark 
SindIer, ASUCSD Vice-president. 
Tuesday night's meeting was at-
tended by 20 <i the 22 members 
with Janet Bills, Fourth College 
rep, and Anita Vittor, Muir College 
rep, not in attendance. Also in 
attendance were 15 students. 

The plan passed is basically the 
same one which was unveiled in 
March (Triton Times, AprilS) with 
a few minor language changes to 
emphasize the proposal is not in its 
final form, but will instead be 
subject to further research and 
revision, Stephen Salmon, 
executive director of the UC office 
of library development, said 
Tuesday. 

The proposal, authored by 
Salmon, would place the library 
books in the two large facilities-
probably located in Berkeley and 
Los Angeles-where they would be 
available on one week call for 
people at the nine campuses.

next 10 years. 

"How are we supposed to know 
what everyone wants if they don:t 
tell us?" asked ASUCSD Com-
missioner of Appointments and 
Evaluations Jim Lofgren. 

Lofgren handles' student 
government appointments of 
students to most of the committees 
at UCSD. His first task is to fill 
these committees, said Lofgren. As 
of last Wednesday, thougb, more 
than a quarter of the committees 
had yet to receive their first a~ 
plicants. 

Lofgren feels this is a result fi 
not having enough ~dents to go 
around. "It is possible that 
students don't know enougb about 
the committees. Also, if there is 
student interest in a committee 
that does not exist, we can form 
one," be said. 

The committees that have not 
yet received applicants include the 
Computer Center Policy Board, 
Vehicle Accident Review Board, 
Program Review Sub-committee 
on Capital Outlay and Space and 
the Advisory Committee on 
Student Health Services. 

The fonning of committees is 
only one stage of creating a strong 
student govel'JlQlent..,accoJ'ding to. 
Lofgren. "'lbe administration 
won't give in to a weak government 
and strength comes in numbers," 
he said. 

Students interested in serving on 
a committee may contact Lofgren 
at the Student Center, and he in-
vited them to attend the ASUCSD 
council meetings Tueld.ays at 7:30 
pm in Buildi.nC "C" fi the Student 
Center. 

The selection of books to be 
placed in storage would be made 
after a study of circulation 
records, with thos& volumes not 
checked out within a certain period 
put in the regional facilities. 

According to Salmon, the 
Afterwards Sindler commented, proposal serves several p~rposes.

that were expected. Hopefully we reqwreme~t ~t U~ draw up !l

Leifer also spoke similarly, 
saying "The meeting was a chance 
for council members to get their 
feet wet. We're trying to work as a 
team to prevent factionalism in the 
AS. Only tbrougb internal harmony 
Can the AS effectively approach 
the Administration. " 

expansloo, he said. 
The proposal also would help 

make the facilities of all the 
campus libraries available to all 
students and faculty and alleviate 
space problems as the libraries 
acquire more boob each year, 
Salmon said. He estimates the 
proposAl would net a savinICI fi $35 
million in library costs over the 

But opponents of Salmon's plan 
feel it will lead to a debilitation of 
the campus libraries and still 
might not produce the expected 
fmancial savings. 

Wright, who has opposed the 
plan since its release last year, 
belie.ves it has not taken into ac-
count that often the only way a 
person can find the books he needs 
is by -looking ~t them, not by 
searching card catalogs. 

Wright also feels that nowhere in 
the Salmon plan is it proven that 
two large facilities will save more 
money than nine smaller branches. 

UCSD is the only campus 
adamantly opposed to the 
reorganization plan, Salmon said.

As A Middle-Aged Woman 
Fiction Writer LeGuin: Portrait of the Artist ... 

by Alan Russell 
News Editor 

It appears that the literature department "reached for 
the stars" in selecting its latest Regent's Lecturer. 

Ursula K. LeGuin, noted science fiction author and 
winner of the prestigious Hugo and Nebula awards, and 
recipient of the National Book Award [The FartbestSbore), 
has made a home of the UCSD campus for the last four 
weeks ofthis quarter. 

her "vel"}' impressed" with the campus as a whole and both 
"excited and scared" by her job. 

"I've taught writing classes before, but I've never han-
dled subject courses," she said in an interview Monday. "I 
guess I'm learning right along with the class." 

LeGuin's fa-st publication, and for "non-payment" at 
that, occurred in 1962 at , age 32, and came after " twelve 
years of sending stuff out." 

Teaching a writing workshop and a literature ~r 
LeGuin admitted with a laugh that, "They're keepmg me 
almost as busy as I can handle." Early observations have 

"Naturally, I was discouraged, but I never stopped 
writing," said LeGuin. "I was trying to appeal to the short 
story market of Ladles Home Journal, Saturday Evening 
Post and the like. I also continued to write poetry and 
novels-parts of which I can now look back on and say were 
marvelous; but the rest, well, not so good." 

!lourle r 

LeGuin's "emergence" as a science fiction writer came 
about 'from a friend who' "re-indoctrinated" her to its 
charms. "I am·, and have been, a voracious reader, 
devouring everything, but I got out of the habit of reading 
science fiction when I was about 16," she said. "When I 
started reading it again, I thought, hey, this is like what I 
write." 

NonetheleSs, LeGuin doesn't label herself as a science 
fiction writer, but rather as a "novelist." "The science 
fiction label is for the publishers and booksellers con-
venience," she said. "The S.F. label both insures and 
restricts a market. No publisher will ever make a killing, 
but it's a sure thing." 

Citing her Oninlan Tales, LeGuin asked, "What genre 
does it fall in? It's not science fiction or fantasy , but it does 
~ take place in a country that doesn't exist." 8 
x Dramatie Change 

~ LeGuin's writings have undergone a fairly dramatic ~ change over the years, in that her early books are whatsM 
£i terms a "mixture of things" (though mostly fantasy), and 

~ in her later works she has moved on to "straight" cienc 
1= fiction or "straight" fantasy. Seeing fantasy as " less 

responsive to immediate concerns," LeGuin said h r 
science fiction reacts to certain situation , such as The 

Dispossessed, which she stated came about because of her 
" dissatisfaction with the idea of government." 

" I'm not an activist ," she said, "but if I have to be labeled 
I could be called an anarchist-though a feeble one as I don't 

. live up to that honorable title." 
Terming herself as " just a writer," LeGuin lives under 

the compulsion of wanting to write " more and better." 
" I don't know what artists do," she said. "One 

dissatisfaction I find in my work is that it sometimes comes 
out moralistic . That's not an artist's business. I think of an 
artist as a person who produces something, like a potter. 
People should find in the work what they want." 

The pipe-smoking LeGuin ("it's not that I want to be 
ostentatious-it's just that I tried to get away from 
cigarettes, dammit!") spends approximately three hours a . 
day on her writing when "composing," producing 
anywhere " from two words to 10 pages." Her most recently 
completed work, as yet untitled, deals with a planet where 
first criminals were dumped and then 100 years later a 
group of pacifists are exiled. It's novella length, and will be 
published soon in an anthology titled Mlllenlal Women. 

As to what occupies a large portion of the rest of LeGuin's 
time, she simply said, "I'm a housewife." Married to a 
professor at Portland State Ul'iversity, she 's the mother of 
three children, aged 13 to 20. 

LeGuin is, to be sure, a feminist and states that "the 
percentage of women scienc fiction writers is kind of 
discouraging." She laughed, cynically, mind you, at a 1967 
letter from a Playboy editor asklng her if they could publish 
her short story ' Nine Lives" under the name of U.K. 
LeGuin a opposed to Ursula LeGuin because, "our readers

said, "but I am fairly active in the 
Science Fiction Writers of 
America. The science fiction 
community is a llvely one and the 
feedback is fantastic ." 

LeGuin predicts the " mingling of 
science fiction with mainstream 
llterature, but doesn't believe it 
will " take over." She seems 
reluctant to be a seer of the future, 
preferring to say, "We're in for 
great changes." She added, "I'm a 
little nervous when I look into the 
future. That's why my works don't· 
deal with the future." 

Presently, fielding mail from 
fans takes up a large part of )1er 
time, and she sadly said " I now get 
too much mail to answer." 

For those aspiring authors, 
LeGuin suggests the obvious : read 
and write. 

"And perhaps they should get 
another job," she said, "so they 
can live off it."
