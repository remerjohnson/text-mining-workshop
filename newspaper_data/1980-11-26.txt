Regents look 
for new way 
to run labs 

BY JACK DANIELS 
A plan proposed by UC President David Saxon for 

improved University management of two 
controversial Department of Energy research 
laboratories was approved by a special committee at 
last week's Board of Regents meeting in San 
Francisco. 

The proposal calls for a new oversight committee 
to more closely monitor the work done at the Los 
Alamos and Lawrence Livermore research 
facilities, much of which centers on weapons 
research and development for the federal 
government. The plan has now gone before the 
Regents for a period of evaluation and revision 
before it is impelemented. 

Saxon's plan was chosen over a more detailed 
oversight program proposed by California Governor 
Edmund G. Brown, Jr. Brown, who failed in two 
previous attempts to influence the Regents to sever 
their connections with the laboratories, submitted 
an outline which, if accepted, would have given the 
Regents much tighter and more detailed control of 
the Livermore and Los Alamos facilities. 

In the past Brown has frequently criticized the 
University's current management of the 
laboratories. He argued that the directors and staff 
of the labs do whatever they and the US 
government want and that the connection between 
the UC system and the research facilities merely 
provides a "cover" of respectability for their work. 

In an attempt to change the University's role as 
an "absolute landlord," both Saxon - who has 
fought repeatedly to maintain the connection 
between the lab and the University - and Brown 
outline plan for increa ed UC involvement in the 
management of Los Alamos and Livermore 
laboratories. Although both proposals called for a 
new oversight committee to monitor the work done 
at the laboratories. the structure and function of the 
committee were points of disagreement between the 
two men. 

Concerning the organization of the committee. 

Fires sweep So Cal again 

Saxon felt that it should be staffed only by members 
of the Board of Regents. Brown, on the other hand, 
stressed the idea of "broad representation" by 
suggesting that people from various levels of the UC 
system be included in the ranks of the committee. 

As to the function of the oversight committee, 
Brown felt that one of its responsibilities should be 
to examine the purpose of the laboratories, both of 
which are heavily involved with weapons research 
and development for the federal government. 
Brown hoped the committee would look into 
possible ways of converting the Los Alamos and 
Livermore facilities to more peaceful uses. 

Fires fanned by erratic Santa Ana winds razed 
southern California yesterday, burning hundreds 
of homes and killing at least four people. 

The largest fire, a 14,000 acre blaze in San 
Bernardino, destroyed 257 structures, killed four, 
and injured more than 400 firefighters and 
civilians. 

In northern San Diego County, a fire burned out 
of control, con uming over 500 acres. The blaze -
near Poway - clo ed Interstate 15 for several hours 
during the afternoon. No home were burned. 

At dusk, the fire burned out of control, and fire 
officials aid they could not predict when they 
would have the blaze contained. 

The fire obliterated the noonday sun at UCSD, 
raining a light grey dust of ash over campus . 

.Acting Gov. Mike Curb declared a state of 
emergency in San Bernardino County, where the 
Panorama fire - worst of the blazes burning in five 
counties - forced thousands of people to evacuate 
dfeir homes. 

In issuing the declaration in Los Angeles, Curb-
filling in for Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. who was at 
a governors' meeting in Washington - cited the 
four fire related deaths, public and private proper~y 
damage estimated by state officials at more than 
$44 million, and more than 400 minor injuries to 
firefighters and civilians. 

"Without a doubt it is unequivocally the worst 
fire we've ever had," said city fire spokesman 
Jimmy Jews. 

The bodies of Earl F. Welty, 83, and his wife 
Edith, 82, were found burned in their yard by 

. sheriff's deputies after their children reported them

2. The Daily Guardian Wednesday, Nov~mber 26,1980 
---~----~~~~~~~--------~~--------~--------------

Gay students get 
recognition, too 
Editor: 

While I understand the 
need of onelohnJ .Jennings to 
express his "shock - and 
disawointment" with the 
UCSD Gay Students' 
newsletter (The Daily 
GlUlrdio", Nov. 20), I feel it 
incumbent upon myself to 
communicate the exceptions 
that I and many other 
students take to his 
observations. 

First of all, Mr. Jennin~ 
will perhaps take comfort 10 
knowing that the page 
devoted to homosexual 
student needs was not 
donated to our group by the 
Gltardian, nor was it 
inexpensive. GSUCSD 
bought that space with funds 
from our budget. This we did 
because we know how 
desperately the existence of 
gay students, so long ignored 
need be publicized. We would 
have preferred a separate 
newsletter, but the problem 
here is that many students, 
fearing the disapproval of the 
few, but often vocal, 
misinformed, would be 
intimidated to be seen 
picking up such a publica· 
tion; these are the students 
who need it the most. 

Secondly, I am astonished 
at the ease with which Mr. 
Jennings has summarily 
dismissed the apparently 
unqualified opinions of the 
American Psychiatric 

Association. Would he ignore 
the volumes of research 
undertaken by psychologists 
and the AMA? Whose 
research would he accept? 
Perhaps he would believe the 
testimony of some of the 
hundreds of gay students 
here who would tell him that 
their homosexuality was 
more a sexual orientation 
beyond their control, than a 
lifestyle of choice. My 
lifestyle as a homosexual has 
certainly presented me with a 
myriad of problems I would 
never have chosen, problems 
created mainly by those 
harboring attitudes such as 
those of Mr. Jennings. 

Lastly, I disagree strongly 
with the author's assump· 
tion that the majority of 
students on this campus 
object tothe publishingof gay 
news in the Guardian. Since 
becoming active in gay· 
oriented activities here I have 
been deeply impressed with 
the open·mindedness and 
heart·felt support given to me 
and our organization by 
almost all the students we 
have encountered . 

In short, Mr. Jennings, we 
are much more interested in 
your research in the field of 
chemistry than in your inept 

~ttempts at social psycholo· 
gyM 

DONALD STEPHENS 
Vice-Pres. GSUCSD 

AS and gay funding 
Editor: 

This letter is written in 
response to John]. Jennings' 
letter (The Daily Guardian, 
Nov. 24). Yes, it is true that 
the newsletter printed in the 
Guardian (Nov. 20) does 
represent the views of the 
Gay Student of UCSD. And 
yes, it is true that the 
ASUCSD has voiced its 
approval of this group's 
activities through its funding 
of GSUCSD. However, the 
fact that there is low 
participation in the ASUCSD 
elections is no basis for Mr. 
Jennings' claim that the 
"vast majority" of students 
are "basically opposed" to 
gay rights and the needs of 
the gay Community. Further, 
the funding procedures of the 
AS are open functions; where 
were you during these 
procedures, Mr. Jennings? 

In his letter, Mr. Jennings 
never mentioned what he 
meant by homosexuality. If 
he uses it in the sense of an 
adjective, then he is saying 
that men and women choose 

to be attracted to others of the 
same sex: that would be 
rather odd for the estimated 
10· 15 percent of the 
population to choose to be 
amongst a group that is 
oppressed (bv uninformed. 
bigoted people like Mr. 
jennings) and is at present an 
often unaccepted minority. If 
Mr. Jennings refers to 
homosexualitv as the acting 
out and acceptance of ones' 
sexual prelerence and 
formation of loving relation-
ships with others of the same 
sex, then what basis is there 
for saying that homosexuals 
choose to live this gay life any 
more than heterosexuals 
choose the straight life? Well, 
Mr. jennings, you havefound 
"the voice on this campus 
that will speak out against 
this immorality": yourself! If 
there be others, let them 
speak also, and let them be 
educated-why not, this is a 
school? 

A GAY STUDENT 
ATUCSD 

Why is he so worried about others? 
Editor: 

It came as no surprise to 
me that when the Gay 
Students of UCSD tried to 
educate this campus about its 
multitudinous ~ay popula· 
tion, they were Immediately 
attacked in the spirit of 
hatred and ignorance seen so 
many times before. John 
Jennings of the Chern.istry 
Department poignan tly 
demonstrated this in his 
letter to the editor (The Daily 
Guardultl, Nov 24), in which 
he expressed his "shock and 
disappointment" that the 
views of homosexual people 
were allowed to be published 
in this periodical. He also 
expressed his shock that the 
GSUCSD is a legally formed 
student organization , one 
which receives AS funding, 
at that. Hewenton to suggest 
that the GS obtained its 
funding through stealthy 
maneuvering behind the 
backs of UCSD students , 
who were studiously at work. 
Finally , he gave some 
"scientific" insight into 
homosexuality, labeling it a 
lifestyle choice which reeks 
of immorality. 

First I should say that the 
GSUCSD newsletter ('1 he 
Daily Guardian, Nov 20) was 
an honest effort to educate 
both the straight and gay 
members of this campus. It 
was intended to let gay people 
here know that there is a 
warm, friendly and political· 
Iy conscientious group of 
people who want to help them 
affirm their dignity and 
worth as human beings, as 
well as to help them stand up 
for their constitutional 
rights. It was intended to let 
straight people know that 
there are alot of good people 
on this campus who happen 
to be gay. It tried to tell 
straight -people that we are 
really a lot like them; it 
demonstrated that straight 

persons are starting - to 
acknowledge this fact. It also 
showed that gay people can 
take an interest in poetry, 
literature, and cuisine, and 
thus can demonstrate well· 
rounded interests, contrary 
to some popular beliefs. 

Clearly Mr. Jennings felt 
that this newletter was a 
violation of his right to 
express his .personal beliefs. 
But even further , the mere 
presence of views contrary to 
his own caused him shock 
and revulsion. Fortunately, 
the Guardian does not 
practice the brand of 
discriminatory censorship 
and c1osed·mindedness 
implicitly recommended by 
Mr. jennings. This is a 
higher·learning institution, 
where diversity in outlook is 
not only admired but 
demanded as a means of 
education. I might point out 
that the Guardian did not 
give the GSUCSD free space 
to pu blish its views; the GS 
had to pay the going rate to 
get its views published. 

As to the issue of a gay 
organization on this campus, 
Mr. Jennings was shocked 
and disappointed to learn 
that the GSUCSD is a legal 
student organization which 
receives AS funds. What is so 
shocking about the fact that a 
law·abiding group of 
students can lawfully 
assemble is beyond my 
comprehension. Perhaps he 
believes that the GS 
entertains wild orgies, drug 
parties and lurid crucifixion 
rituals. Clearly, the GS has 
nothing to do with such 
activities, and certainly does 
not condone them. Jenning's 
shock that the AS would duly 
grant a large group of 
students with common 
interests and beliefs a budget 
is merely a reflection of his 
ignorance. 

vast majority of students ... 
are basically opposed to this 
sort of thing' (i.e., to the 
existence and funding of an 
organization for gay 
students), I assert that he is 
no representative for student 
opinion on this campus. No 
doubt there are people who 
oppose the existence of an 
organization which meets the 
needs of gay people, but the 
prevalance of such opinion i 
certainly subject to more 
scientific verification than 
the word of Mr. Jenning . 
Indeed, if the majority of 
people hated and feared so 
intensely the existence of a 
gay group on campus, they 
would presumably get off 
their duffs to organize with 
the same intensity and 
sincerity as did the GSUCSD. 

Finally, I must not leave 
unanswered his statement 
that "not withstanding what 
psychiatrists say, homo-
sexuality is a lifestyle, a 
choice, not something one is 
born with." In actuality, the 
psychiatric community is 
still very uncertain about the 
nature of homosexuality, and 
even the gay community is 
divided on this issue. It is 
interesting that Mr. Jennings 
has suddenly hecome an 
expert on a topic which has 
been disputed for 130 years, 
and remains as confusing 
and disputed as ever. Again , 
his ignorance and prejudices 
show through remarkably. I 
suggest that Mr Jennings 
stick to chemistry. 

Let me ask you, Mr. 
Jennings, to put aside your 
ignorance, hatred, and 
misconceptions, and find out 
what the Gay Students are 
really about. We are looking 
to make a friend of you. 
Finally, let me tell you that 
the multitude of gay students 
on this campus are vivacious, 
proud and are here to stay_ 

R.L. LAWRENCE 

MENTOO defends its role 
What was particularly 

erroneous and offensive in 
his letter was his implication 
that the GS plotted and 
maneuvered secretly to push 
through an operating budget, 
while students were busily at 
work, unable to oppose this 
"outrage." The fact is, the 
GS presented its budget pro. 
posal in public hearings be-
fore the AS. Also, the GS got 
only a small portion of what it 
considered a conservative 
and well·thought budget 
proposal. Presumably, Mr. 
Jennings should have been at 
this hearing to air his beliefs, 
but once again, a a 
con equence of his ignorance, 
apparently knew nothing of 
the hearing or of the Gay 
Students' intention to attend. 
As to his tatement that "the

several letters in resp:mse to 
the formation of MENTOO. 
Eddie Staircase's letter, 
"One way to stamp out

(Daily Guardian. Nov. 19), 
was an enlightened evalua· 
tion of the opposition to 
MENTOO and multiple 
orgasm , and how this 
opposition is based on 
predilection and ignorance. 
Mr . Staircase's mo t 
important point, though , was 

in presenting the scientifical-
ly demonstrated especial 
need of all men to become 
multi-orgasmic, in order to 
reduce the potential for 
"prostrate" cancer. (Perhaps 
Mr. Staircase meant prostate 
cancer, the prost ate gland is a 
common site for cancer in 
males. As members of 
MENTOO will testify,

the surface of the earch. 

Also, Mr. Staircase argued 
that "if multiple orgasms 
were universally shared by 
men and women, it would 
only increase the nubmer of 
births ... ". However, this 
would not be the case. 
Multiple orgasms attained on 
a regular basis actually lead 
to temporary sterility in men.

Editor: 
This is an open letter to al\ 

students at UCSD because 
all students will be and are 
affected by draft registration. 
Not only will this letter give 
important names and 
numbers to be referred to in 
the future but it will also 
inform you of what draft 
registration means, where 
you can go to get help now, 
and some activities that will 
be happening il1 the weeks to 
come. 

Perhaps a brief history of 
- events that occurred 

throughout the last year 
would be helpful. 

It was on Jan. 23,1980 that 
President Carter, in his State 
of the Union speech, announ: 
ced that he would request 
funds from Congress to reac· 
tivate the Selective Service 
System. The announcement 
virtually overnight brought 
on opposing response from 
people in Congress, the press, 
community groups and 
student groups at colleges 
and universities across the 
country.

Registration is not ·a dead issue 
On Jan. 31, the San Diego 

Students For Peace (SDSP) 
was formed here at UCSD. 
SDSP was formed to create 
action and inform students 
about their rights and 
options regarding the draft 
and draft registration. 

On Feb 23, the Washington 
Post told of the Selective 
Service Report, sent toJimmy 
Carter on Jan. 16, that stated 
that registration is "unneces-
sary" and "redundant". 

February was also a month 
where both locally and 
nationally rallies and 
demonstrations took place on 
the largest scale since the 
draft was ended over seven 
years ago. 

And it was on Feb_ 5 that 
the Student Body Presidents 
of all nine University of 
California campu es announ· 
ced that they would actively 
oppose President Carter's 
proposed draft registration. 

This type of information 
regarding the widespread 
opposition to draft registra-
tion being reinstituted could 
continue at length, but more 

importantly the fact that 
after registration was 
reinstituted theoppostion did 
not stop. ~nti-draft groups 
continued to inform young 
people about the rights and 
options they had in n~~ards to 
draft registration . And 
young people were able to 
make educated decisions 
regarding registering for the 
draft this last summer. 

Even after the attempted 
cohersion by the Selective 
Service System and estima· 
tes of 98 percent compliance, 
there was seen at least a 25 
percent resistance at the end 
of registration last June. 

This meant that over one 
million of the four million 
elibigle males decided not to 
regIster for the draft. Here in 
San Diego figure showed 
that non ' registration was 
over 30 percent! 

All of this is very important 
to remem ber come this 
January_ On Jan. 5, all 18 
year-old males will be asked 
to register and henceforth 
registratIOn for the draft will 
be a decision every male at 

that age will have to 
contemplate. 

Nobody should ever 
consider registering for the 
draft before at least 
contacting either a draft 
counselor or a draft 
information group to find out 
all your options. You should 

find out exactly what 
deferments will or will not be 
available during a draft, how 
you might qualify for one of 
these. You also should be 
informed of the changes in

Prices rise 
in state 
at 13.60/0 

AP - Consumer prices in 
California jumped by 1.6 
percent during the past two 
months, putting them 13.6 
percent higher than the 
previous year the state 
Department of Industrial 
Relations reported yesterday 
in San Francisco. 

Meantime, Hank Shimada 
of the Employment Develop-
ment Department in 
Sacramento reported that 
real spendable income for a 
family of four in California 
had dropped by 7.1 percent 
since October 1979. 

For Los Angeles, real 
income was down by 5.3 
percent and for San 
Francisco by 6.3 percent. 

. Real spendable income is 
measured by deducting 
!nflation from average wage 
Increases. 

The data covers the last 
full month before President 
Carter was defeated by 
Republican President-elect 
Ronald Reagan and reflects 
spiraling home mortgage 
rates from about August , 
when t.hey were just heating 
up again. 

The statewide Con umer 
Price Index is computed 
bimonthly. 

For Los Angeles and 
Orange counties, where the 

C~I is figured every month , 
pnces rose by 1.2 percent for 
October, putting them 13.9 
percent higher than the year 
before, the Labor Depart-
ment said. The monthly 
increase was the largest since 
May. 

However, all except 0.2 
percent of the rise was 
accounted for by the cost of 
shelter, including home 
prices, mortgage interest and 
rents. 

Home lending rates usually 
don't show up for a couple of 
months while home pur-
chases are making their way 
through escrow. The CPI 
measures only mortgage 
contracts that have been 
concluded at the end of 
escrow. 

"The really hefty increases 
in interest rates haven't 
shown up yet," said Faith 
Heinemann , chief of the US 
Bureau of Labor Statistics in 
Los Angeles. 

Loan interest rates have 
risen to arou nd 17 percen t as 
the Federal Reserve Board 
has raised its discount rate to 
tighten credit and limit the 
amount · of money in 
circulation. The rates are the 
highest since February and 
March when they reached 
record levels. 

The Southern Califorqia 
CPT showed housing co ts 
were up 2.1 percent in 
October, a rise of16.6 percent 
over the year. . 

"The realIy encouraging 
thing was that food price 
remained unchanged and 
prices for mo st other 
consumer goods changed 
very little," Ms. Heinemann 
said. 

In San Francisco, that 
city's bimonthly CPI showed 
prices were up by only 0.4 
percent, but were still 13.7 
percent higher for the year. 

"They had some pretty 
hefty increases in food price.c; 
during the two months." Ms. 
Heinemann said. 

However. Bay Area 
housing costs for the period 
actually declined 0.6 percent 
but was till 16.6 percent 
above its level a year ago.

NEWS BRIEFS 

Iran, Algeria talk 
hostage release 

BEIRUT, Lebanon -
The speaker of the Iranian 
Parliament said yesterday 
that Iran was discussing 
with Algerian intermediaries 
ways the United States 
might meet its terms for 
releasing the 52 US hostages. 
He declined to say whether 
the demands were negotiable. 

Parliamentary speaker 
Hashemi RafsanJani addres-
sed a news conference here as 
US officials in Washington 
awaited an Iranian message 
said to request a further 
explanation of the US 
position. 

The message was being 
delivered by three Algerian 
envoys. They were scheduled 
to arrive late yesterday. 

The message was being 
kept secret until handed over 
to Secretary of State Edmund 
S. Muskie. but officials in 
Washington.said they didn't 
expect it to amount to a yes or 

no response to US proposals 
flown to Algiers by Deputy 
Secretary of State Warren M. 
Christopher. 

"I would imagine we are 
going to have some difficult 
questions on financial

Iran and Iraq 
claim success 

BAGHDAD. Iraq - Iran 
claimed yesterday to have cut 
into Iraqi positions along the 
entire 300 mile battlefront 
and to have cracked the Iraqi 
siege of the oil refining city of 
Abadan. 

Iraq, meanwhile, said it 
had held back Iran ' s 
counterattacks and that 
Abadan was in a "tightening 
stranglehold. " 

Iraq's Foreign Minister 
Saadoun Hammadi was 
quoted as saying life was 
returning to normal in most 
of Iraq despite Iranian claims 
of approaching victory and 
reports of heavy fighting 
inside Iran . 

The independent Kuwaiti 
newspaper AI Qabas quoted 
him saying foreign firms that 
pulled employees out of Iraq 

when the war erupted Sept. 
22 were returning to work. 

Iranian President Abolhas-
san Bam Sadr, meanwhile, 
told pilots at Isfahan's 
airbase in central Iran that 
his forces were "approaching 
the point of forcing the Ira<J,i 
government to concede 
defeat," the official Pars 
news agency reported.

FULL TUITION SCHOLARSHIP 
to the National University School of Law 

The National University School of Law provides management personnel 
a solid legal framework of business. A legal education is particularly 
important because the rapid growth of governmental rules and 
regulations, increasing litigation, changing laws, and increased concern 
for product liability are all becoming matters of serious concern . The 
successful executive of the 1980's will most probably be an attorney who 
is able to grasp these complex issues of tomorrow's American business. 
Recognizing that some people are exceptional leaders, National 
University has made some full tuition scholarships available to 
outstanding students . If you have a superior academic and employment 
record and have attained a score of 600 or better on the LSAT, you may 
qualify for up to a $3480 two-year scholarship at the National University 
School of Law in San Diego.

Juilliard highlights the 
Winter programming 

New approach for movies; no rock 
acts planned at gymnasium as yet 

BY JEFF BERESFORD·HOWE 
Arts Editor 

T he return of the Julliard String Quartet 
wi ll highlight next quarter's campus events 
programming schedule. The quartet, which 
a lso played on campus last year, is one of the 
world's best. 

Last year, they played an all· Beethoven 
program, but their Feb. 28, 1981 appearance 
has Mozart's Quartet in E Flat, Verdi's 
Quartet in E Minor and Brahm's Quartet in C 
Minor, opus 51 on the program. 
. Other concerts scheduled for next quarter 
include the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra Feb. 
20 and the Lico Chorus Feb. 22 making for an 
8-day orgy of classical music, but no rock and 
roll is scheduled for the next quarter. 
Las erium 

An exception to the lack of rock and roll is 
the Laserium show, a San Francisco laser 
show accompanied by taped rock and roll. The 
show is planned for Feb. 12-14 in Mandeville 
Auditorium, with two or three shows a night 
at about $4 a ticket. 

Final confirmation of the show hasn't been 
announced because of difficultie in adapting 
Mandeville to the water-cooling system used 
by the lasers. 

Why no live rock and roll next quarter? 
University Events attributes its absence to 

the fact that most rock shows lose money here, 
so the office harbor its cash on till the end of 
the year to find out what's available . 

The best shows are therefore usually spring 

~uarter. Last year, the Pretenders and outhside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes p ayed in spring after a quiet year. 
The other reason most frequently 

mentioned by UEO staff is the UCSD Gym, 
which has been variously described as a 
"stinking heap" or, at best, "uncomfortable" 
by concert-goers there. 

"We have to overbid everybody to get hows 
there because no one wants to play tnere, 
say.s Lynne Peterson, UEO chief programmer. 
"If someone el e bid $5,000, we have togo up 
to $6,500 to get them," she ay . 

So Mandeville becomes the main venue for 
UEO how of all kinds. Two are already 
scheduled for next quarter: a lecture by Gore 
vidal, author and literary gadfly, and jazz 
performance by the L.A. 4, compo ed of Ray 
Brown on bass, Lorendo Almeida on guitar, 
Jeff Hamilton on drums and Bud Shankon alto 
sax and flute. 

The L.A. 4 are playing Jan. 10, aturdayof 

the quarter's first week. The box office is 
closed during vacation, but the address for 
mail tickets is: University Events, B-009, 
Student Center, UC San Diego, La Jolla, Calif., 
92039. 
Movies 

Campus movies will have a different 
emphasis this coming quarter. 

In addition to the Fantasy Film Festival (see 
story p. 7), the movies represent what UEO 
r.r0grammer Ruth Bailey sees as an attempt to 
'get away from the blockbuster and program 

more foreign and art movies." 
"The whole emphasis should be different. 

We're going to try and tell people more what 
the movies are about, and (will) even hand out 
flyers at the films for people to know more 
about them," Bailey says. 

The shift i n't total- the first Friday night 
movie is The Blues Bro!hers - but The Tin 
Drum, La Cage Aux Folies and Beillg There are 
all scheduled. The rest of the schedule hasn't 
been set. 

Also, the Underwater Film Festival, an 
annual presentation here, is set for Feb. 7 and 
the Dark Star science fiction club wants to

The Daily Guardia .. 

UCSD filnt-ntakers 
get a chance to sho\V off 

BY L YNElTE TOM 
Staff Writer 

One of the most frustrating things that 
separates the independent filmmaker from his 
Hollywood counterpart is the accessibility of 
an audience. He either has to have some very 
reliable connections or exchange individuality 
for commercialism ... unless he happens to live 
in San Diego. Local filmmakers now have an 
outlet of distribution, thanks to an upcoming 
film festival featuring works by independent 
filmmakers. 

"It's an opportunity for people to get their 
stuff shown," said Kevin Hogan, local 
coordinator. "I think that with the kind of 
cultural hunger we have in San Diego, where 
people are becoming more actively involved in 
what they think and place more emphasis on 
the appreciation of films, the current market 
is not nourishing it." 

San Diego material will be screened on 
Saturday evenings in conjuntion with 
features by their American filmmakers . The 

opening date is tentatively set for November 
29 and will run as long as there are 
productions. So far, Hogan has received fifteen 
to twenty local submissions, many of which 
have been made by UCSD students. 

"They're (the UCSD students) top-drawer 
as technicians," he stated. "They have created 
a certain genre of University ideology of what 
experimental film is." 

Selection of films is based upon the 
subjective decision of a committee that 
consists of Hogan and three others. There is 
no set criterion for choosing. although Hogan 
feels that "it's important that the films do 
something to you. The audience is asking for 
thought -out presentations of ideas 
communicated from the filmmaker to the 
people." 

"We try to choose films that will 
compliment or contrast with what's being 
shown" he added .

'Six new shows, tDancin' 
among them, planned 

Six shows, including the 
Broadway hits Eubie, 
Danein' andl\rter Pan, with 
Sandy Duncan. will visit San 
Diego over the next year and 
a half as part of the 
Nederlander orEtanization's 
subscription senes. 

The shows, which will 
stage at the Fox Theater 
downtown, also includes 
Barnum, a musical panned 
on Broadway (except for the 
performance of Jim Dale in 
the lead - he won a Tony, 
but the Nederlander 
organization said he probably 
wouldn't be in the touring 
company, Richard Burton in (Amerot, a revival, Bubi£, a 
revue of the songs of jazz 
pianist Eubie Blake, and A 
Turn to the Right, the only 

(; . 
straight pili)" 61 the six. 

It is a 1916 play revived, 
Ned erlander publicity 
insists, because Buddy Ebsen 
was charmed by it when he 
saw it as a kid . 

Eubie will run Dec. 30 of 
this year till Jan. 4 of 1981. 

This school year, Turn to 
tlte Rip.t(early Feb.) and Bob 
Fosse s Dancrn' will appear 
(late Feb.). The others are 
planned for next school year. 
except Camelot, which will 
open after school in Los 
Angeles. The Nederlander 
organization will arrange 
charters for subscribers to 
see the show. 

The Fox Theater, a 
converted movie house, is one 
of the worst stages for 
musicals on the West Coast.

Christmas Carol 

'Carol'set 
for Rep 

The San Diego Repertory 
Theatre's 1980 production of 
Charles Dickens' classic tale. 
A Christmas Carol. will open 
on Tuesday, Dec. 2 at 8:00 
pm. 

Douglas Jacobs , who is 
directing this year's Fifth 
Anniversary Production and 
wrote the original adapta-
tion, played the role of 
Scrooge in the 1977 
production and directed the 
play last year. 

Jacobs has won wide praise 
from San Diego critics arid 
audiences alike for his unique 
adaptation of the famous 
Dickens' novel. Written 
originally in 1843, it has 
become the cia sic holiday 
story. and Jacobs has 
attempted in both his 
adaptation and staging to 
remain as close as possib.1e to 
the original feeling of the 
book. 

It is a uniquere-tell ingthat 
features mu sic, mim e, 
singing and dancing. The 
Rep's playhouse-in-a-chapel, 
with its s tained glass 
windows and high beamed 
ceilings, is easily trans-
formed into the Victorian 
Townhall that is the setting 
of the play.

continued from palle 3 
time. All of these concerns 
are vital before you make a 
decision that will affect the 
rest of ¥our life. 

. The SDSP is an anti-draft 
group on campus that can 
help you with all of the 
previous and other nece sary 
mformation . SDSP can also 
give you information on how 
to contact the National 
Lawyers Guild , C~RD , o.rthe 
CCCO. Also startmg wmter 
quarter , SDSP will be 
offering peer draft counsel-
ing. Due to the fact that no 
draft counseling presently 
takes place on campus, 
students, on a volunteer 
basis will be working with 
the National Lawyers Guild 
to provide excellent objective 
draft counseling. Students 
will be albe to receive 
information on what you 
need to know and how vou 
can form a file . This is most 
important to keep in mind, 
because young people may 
have as little time as two-
weeks after a draft is 
reinstituted , to claim either a 
conscientious objector status 
or medical problems. You 
must start now! You mus t 
begin to document and write 
your cases now if you want to 
be prepared later. 

SDSP is located in the 
Associated Student Office, 
above EDNA in the Student 
Center. We will be open and 
have people to help you 
during the break; if you need 
to contact us you can call us 
at 452·4450, or write us at

that multiple orgasms will 
rid the world of prostate 
cancer but will simultaneo· 
u ly solve the overpopu lation 
problem by a natural or "God 
given " means of birth 
control. 

While these benefits of 
multiple orgams are surely 
enough to compel any 
healthy male to become a 
believer in polyorgasmism, 
the most powerful and world· 
revolutioni zing aspec t of 
becoming multi ·orgasmic has 
yet to be discussed. Members 
of WAPE (Women Against 
Premature Ejaculation) and 
MENTOO have been lobby· 
ing to form a new organiza-
tion, haring their common 
principles. This group, if 
organized, stresse the 
possibility of world peace and 
universal love through the 
practice of multi pie orga ms. 
The tentative name of this 
organization is , HUMAN

12 The Daily Guardian Wednesday, November 26,1980 

Oversight committee and Saxon 
continued from pale 5 
allow for the UC system to 
specify the type of research 
conducted at the two 
facilities, 

Under Saxon's plan. the 
oversight committee will 
report directly to the 

Presiof'nt of the University 
and not to the Regents, as 
Brown had suggested, In 
addition, Saxon will receive 
periodic reports from two 
special advisory committees 
concerning the quality of the 

'work done at the labs ; the 

seismic integrity of the 
buildings at the two sites; 
and the health and safety of 
the people involved with the 
research at Los Alamos and 
Livermore and thosewholive 
in the surrounding areas, 

Saxon's outline for the 

oversight committee has 
been met with disapproval 
from Brown and others who 
feel that the plan is too 
general and invests t he 
President with far too much 
responsibility in laboratory 
management. Brown con-

What the HELL do 
you think you're doing? 

It should be painfully obvious by now that the world as we know it won't last too damn much longer, And what are you 
doing about it? Going to work or school. coming home. goofing around, What will happen to your routine when all the 
shit comes down on u~ at once? Don't you feel responsible for trying to help this endangered planet? 

No? Good , The fact is, it's too late, There isn't a god damned thing you as an individual can do about eco-disaster, 
nuclear death. overpopulation and so on , Things are going to Hell on a fast train and about the only thing you, or anyone 
el e besides the Rockefellers, can do about it is to just sit back and watch the show . 

But remember - the End of the World may be much worse and take mu h longer than you thought, The mere act of 
~illing in your home watching everything fall apart on TV ma y be too much for even the stoutest brain to take. In fact, 
the more alert and intelligent you are, the quicker you 'II likely be driven to suicide by the sheer hideousness of what you'll 
be seei ng . WILL YOU BE READY? 

WILL YOU STILL BE SANE ENOUGH TO LAUGH WHEN THA T WHICH MUST COME TO PASS. COMES 
TO PASS? WILL YOU EVER GET SLACK?? 

Study our SubGenius "literature" cJo~ely. Keep it by your toilet and memorile it. If you aren't as dense as most peo-
ple, you'll be quick to realize that , chee y scam though it might well be, the Church of the SubGer.ius is just about the only 
organization around that can help you fa ce the god-awful facts without some sort of ingratiating, sweetness-and-light, 
goody-two-shoes, pollyanna, life-is-a-bowl-of-cherries bullshit. Not only thai, but the Church of the SubGenius is 
beyond the shadow of a doubt THE ONL Y TRUE RELIGION . We perform miracles, answer ony question. invoke 
demons, and have a direct etheric hot line to space god JfhoVlh I through our infra-psychic trance-babbling Personal 
Savior, J. R, "Bob" Dobbs - who i~ actually a pretty regular guy, just very rich and possessed by forces greater than 
Man . 

The SubGenius material has only recently been made pUblic. This is your chance to get in on the ground noor of a huge, 
lucrative cult - NOW, while rate~ are low , so that you will not only recieve the immediate benefits listed on our Applica-
iion Coupon, but will al 0 be eligible for all the SSS, weird sex. drugs, and sheer power over others that go with high-

power plays, insanely morbid truths and panhandling. zombie- like teenage "followers." 

For the sake of what little you still hold dear, we urge you to submit this application so that we may determine if you are

When little more than a 
year old, Sunina passed a 
stri ngent series of tests to 
prove her worth - ranging 
from unblemi shed skin to an 
extremely serene composure 
and an acceptable horoscope 
- and was installed as 
Nepal's " Raj Kumari ," or 
"Royal Virgin Goddess," 

Nepal has several Kumaris 
but only one "royal" Kumari , 
She lives in Katmandu and is 
prayed to directly by the 
Himalayan nation's king in a 
Hindu and Buddhist practice 
or virgin worship that date 
back to the sixth century B.C, 

According to legend, an 
ancient Nepalese king so 
offended the Devi goddess 
Kumari that she refused to 
have anything to do with him 
directly , maintaining contact 
with him only through a 
young virgin. 

His subjects believe that 
the king, who maintains near 
absolute control in this 
rugged, landlocked country. 
receives his power through 
the reigning royal Kumari . 

Sick Nepalese also worship 
kumari to seek cure, 
politician make offering 
hoping to advance their 
careers and others come 
before her in keeping with the -
demands of various ceremo-
nies. 

Kumari al 0 is v ry 
popular with the tourist, 

For ]0 years, Sunina wa

Brush fires continue in So Cal 
continued from page 6 
heading northwest towards 
Bear Canyon; 

-The 3,000 acre Summit 
fire above Rancho Cuca-
monga fire about halfway 
between the San Bernardino 
and Mount Baldy fires ; 

- The Sycamore fire, 
which was 25 percent 
contained after ,blackening 
3,000 acres of brush covered 
hillside and one shed in the 
San Bernardino National 
Forest about 5 miles east of 
the Panorama fire; 

- The Lakeland fire, 
which began three miles 
southwest of Lake Elsinore in 
Riverside County and had 
blackened between 6.000 and 
7,000 acres and destroyed one 
unoccupied guest house on 
its westward march through 
Rancho Capistrano; 

-The Prado Flood Control 
Basin fire near Corona, It had 
burned 225 acres of brush 
and was 90 percent contained 
and 50 percent controlled by 
mid day; 

-The 'Malibu Canyon fire 
about 30 miles west of Los 
Angele.s , which was 60 
percent contained and 
holding more or less steady at 
2,600 acres. 

"We have started backfire 
operations along Highway 18 
and in the Rim Forest area, 
the fire's northeastern 
flank, " said US Forest 
Service spokeswoman 
Joanna Guttman, 

She said firefighters were 
counting on Highway 15 -
the main artery between 
Southern California and Las 
Vegas - to hold the fire in 
check on the west. Flames 
had jumped the four lane 
highway in some places, but 
were quickly snuffed out, 

The blaze began Monday in 
the San Bernardino National 

, Forest and propelled 
towards the southwest by 
Santa Ana winds blowing up 
to 100 mph at times - swept 
suddenly down the hills into 
the Nortl)park area in the 
city's northwestern corner, 

Its swift progress stunned 
residents, some of whom lost 
their homes within less than 
an hour. 

"I saw a great wall of fire 
and smoke coming down the 
street," said Dick Schmidt, 
who was called home from 
work Monday afternoon by 
his daughter. "We just 
grabbed everything we could 
throw in the car and headed 
out. It was unreal." 

"We thought it would stay 
up there for awhile. Then 

ed • h everyone start runntng, 
. said Caroline Moseman , 

whose Northpark home was 
destroyed, 

About 900 of the homeless 
sought refuge at the National 
Orange Show grounds 
overnight. About 50 volun-
teers from Norton Air Force 
Base, which was not near the 
fire area, were assisting the 
crowd and traffic control at 
the exhibition center, said 
Capt. Phillip RatIiss . 

Authorities reported four 
looting arrests in the 
Northpark area overnight, 
but none during the day. 

"We have rather intensive 
patrols up there to avoid that 
sort of thing," said police Lt. 
E~e Allender, 

Except for Interstate 15 
and Highway 138, all roads 

into the fire area were closed, fire's western flank were also Rivers ide County on Monday and two room bedrooms 
worth about $15.000. On top of the several hundred asked to leave yesterday. and then jumped into Orange 

homes evacuated Monday in County overnight. About BOof CostadeCaza's 
500 residents left voluntarily, 
and the Joplin Boys Camp 
WllS also evacuated.

FOR PEACE AT UCSD 

No snow 
(AP) - the traditional 

Thanksgiving opening of the 
ski season in California will 
probably . be delayued as 
resort operators await the 
season's first snowfalls. 

Three ski areas .. Snow 
Summitt and Gold Mine in 
the San Bernardino Mts. and 
Boreal on Interstate 80 in the 
north .. are now operating 
with machine made - snow, 
officials said. 

LOS ANGELES (AP) -
State legislators were urged 
yesterday to enact sharp 
media restrictions -
including an embargo on 
election results - to protect 
Western voters from 
"disenfranchisement" in the 
next presidential election. 

An unsuccessful congres-
sional candidate, a pollster 
and a deputy secretary of 
state were among those 
testifying here at an 
Assembly committee hearing 
into the ' effect President 
Carter's early concession and 
network projections of a 
Republican landslide had on 
West Coast voters. 

Although they were the 
target of considerable 
criticism yesterday ; none of 
the major television 
networks was included on 
the list of witnesses invited 
by Assemblyman Mike Roos, 
D·Los Angeles, chairman of 
the Assembly Committee on 
E;lections and Reapportion-
ment. 

The right of the press to 
report and comment on 
election trends before all polls 
have closed came under 
occasionally bitter debate. 
More than one critic, 
includiftJ unsuccessful 
congressIOnal candidate 
Carey Peck, complained that 
the media was able to keep 
the name of J.R. Ewing's

assailant a secret, but not the 
name of the president elect. 

Peck, who favored a self 
imposed "media blackout" of 
election commentary until all 
polls have closed, said 
Election Day broadcasts 
"affected my race. It may 
have made the difference_" 

Erwin A. Lewis, director of 
polling for The Los Angeles 
Timt?3, said a post elect ion 
survey failed to prove that 
voters were significantly 
influenced by media 
projections Nov. 4. 

But Tony Miller, a deputy 
to Secretary of State March 
Fong Eu, said Carter's early 
concession and network 
harbingers of the Republican 
sweep had a "definite and 
devastting" impact on 
California voters. He 
acknowledged, however, that 
his figures were the results 
only of a "semi official" 
canvas. 

"Several hundred thou-
sand who would have voted 
did not - and they did not 
because of this impact," he 
said, adding that "voter lines 
dissolved like ice cream 
doused with boiling water" 
after word spread of Reagan 's 
victory. 

Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Ed Edelman said 
he did not think TV networks 
have the right to poll voters 
as they leave voting places, 

Such a poll prompted one 
major network to accurately 
predict Ronald Reagan as the 
winner hours before West 
Coast .polls closed Nov. 4. 

"There ' s somethin~ 
sacrosanct about voting,' 
Edelman said. "I don't think 
anyone has the right to ask 
you how you vote. I think 
that is wrong. It has a chilling 
effect." 
. The supervisor was 
interrupted by Assemblyman 
Robert Naylor, R-San Mateo, 
who said: "I thought that in 
this country anyone had the 
right to ask any question, and 
anyone had the right not to 
answer." 

Naylor is vice chairman of 
the committee, which 
conducted the public hearing 
at Los Angeles City Hall. 

Edelman acknowledged 
the media's First Amend-
ment right, but added, 
"Sometimes one right has to 
give way to another righL" 

Miller also said the early 
announcement defused 
election night get out the vote 
plans. Volunteers who would 
otherwide have been driving 
persons to the polls 
"suddenly did not show up, 
and I am told a number of 
voters were left stranded in 
their homes," he said. 

WASHINGTON (AP) -
President Carter told an 
audience of ministers in the 
East Room of the White 
House yesterday that the 
time has come for American 
Christians to stop condemn-
ing each other and to "heal 
the wounds" caused by 
religious divisions in this 
year's political campaign~ . 

He called for a search for 
"common ground on which 
we Christians can serve 
Christ best." 

"Atter all I've read in the 
news media over the ·last 
several months , it's a 
remarkable sight to see so 
many people who believe in 
God in the same room 
without physical combat," 
Carter told the more than 250 
ministers . 

The Pres ident used a 
ceremony marking National 
Bible Week to comment on 
the campaign which saw 
direct and active involve-
ment by a number of 
fundamentalist Christian 
groups, including Moral 
Majority and the Christian 
Voice Lobby on Capitol Hill. 

Carter's remarks appeared 
to be aimed at those groups 
which harshly criticized him 
during the campaign for wha 
they claimed was a betrayal 
of his born-again Christian 
religious values. 

Please recycle 
this newspaper 

The groups contended he 
violated what they claimed to 
be the "Christian" positions 
against asbortion, the Equal 
Rights Amendment, gay 
rights, the Department of 
Education and the People's 
Republic of China.
