Followi ng a campus study that 
s; ggested the Resident ial Securi ty 
Officer program at UCSD is unsat-
isfactory, a five-person work group 
has released suggestions for admin -
istrators to improve the image of 
the RSO program in the eyes of 
students, including expanding ways 
to curb student drinki ng in order to 
present RSOs who bust students as 
less of a damper on residential li fe . 

According to th e 2005 
Undergraduate Student Experience 
and Satisfaction report, which 
detailed undergraduate li fe and was 
compiled by campus offi cials, stu -
dents and alumni, many students 
found the conitant patrolling and 
monitoring by officers to be off-put-
ting, with one student even calling it 
"a Nazi-like sense of duty." 

The group, on behalf of Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Joseph 
w. Watson, analyzed the mission 
statement of the RSO program as 
well as the varying misconceptions 
of what falls ul)der their job descrip-
tion. 

The newly released report sug-
gests that, in recent years, RSOs 
have been forced to complete not 
only their own duties of ensuring 
the safety of people and property on 
campus, but also various responsi-
bilities of residential advisers and 
campus administration in monitor-
ing the behavior of students. 

These misconceptions, the report 
suggests, contribute to the negative 
image students may have of the 
RSOs. 

"This appears to the work group 
to be the case where the RSOs and 
the residence life programs were 
identified as being too restrictive 
when in fact, they are only serv-
ing to enforce others' policies," the 
report stated. 

While the report supported and 
approved of the RSO program as a 
whole, A.S. President Harry Khanna 
said he was disappointment in the 
findings. 

"It 's like they said 'the RSO pro-
gram is great, but the students aren't 
educated enough to understand it;" 
Khanna said. "Of course they're 
going to say [the program works]. 
Look who's writing it - if they 
thought the RSO program needed 
fIXing, they'd have fIXed it by now." 

Khanna referenced the lack of

After Suicide, Santa Cruz 

Gets Interim Leader 
In the wake of the suicide of 

UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Denice 
Denton, which occurred on June 
24 , UC President Robert C. Dynes 
has appointed George Blumenthal 
as acting in terim chancellor. 

Blumenthal , 60, has been a 
member of the UC Santa Cruz 
fa c ulty since 1972 . He cha ired 
the UC Santa Cruz astronomy 
and astrophysics department and 
the Santa Cruz division of the 
Academic Senate. He was also 
a fac ulty representative to the 
Board of Regents from 2003 unt il 
2005 . 

He will assume Denton 's 
responsibi lities on an interim 
basis fo r the 2006-07 academi c 
yea r while a national search for 
a permanent successor is con-
ducted - a process which will 
begin this fall . 

" I greatly appreciate 
[Blumenthal 's] willingness to step 
in at this difficult moment," Dynes 
said. "1 know that he, working 
with campus Provost David Kliger 
and the other talented members 
of the existi ng leadership team, 
wi ll help the campus continue · 
moving forwa rd - which it abso-
lutely must do." 

Blumenthal received his bach-
elor's degree fro m the Universi ty 
of Wisconsi n-Milwa ukee a nd his 

Ph .D. in physics from UCS D. 
As a theoreti cal astrop hysicist, 
Blumenthal's research, spans sev-
eral areas, including the nature of 
dark matter. 

Blumenthal accepted the 
responsibility, expressing his ded-
ication to continuing the upward 
mobi lity of the campus. 

"We shall increase th e enro ll-
ment in our graduate and profes-
sional programs, while maintain-
ing our uncommon commitment 
to undergraduate education," 
Blume nthal said . "Our campus 
will remain committed to diver-
si ty a nd tolerance at all levels of 
the institution." 

The Zen of Cancer-
Free Prostates 

Hippiedom and vegetarian-
ism may help men escape the 
risk of prostate cancer, a recent 
study conducted by the Moores 
Cancer Center and the UCSD 
School of Medicine has found . 
The six-month study showed that 
plant-based diets and low-stress 
lifestyles might reduce levels of 
the prostate-specific antigen that 
causes cancer. 

Patients who increased con-
sumption of whole grains, leafy 
green vegetables, beans, legumes 
and fruit, while decreasing dairy 
and carbohydrates and practic-

ing stress management exercises, 
such as meditation, yoga and rai 
chi , displayed a decrease in the 
recurrence of cancer. 

Ten patients with invasive 
prostate ca ncer completed the 
cli nical trial. Four patients expe-
rienced an absolute reduction in 
their PSA leve ls, and nine out of 
' 0 experienced a decrease in the 
ra te of further PSA rise. 

This study served as a scien-
ti fic breakthrough,' according to 
Cancer Center member Gordon 
Saxe. 

"The magnitude of effect of 
these findings is the strongest 
observed to date among dietary 
and nutritional interventions in 
this patient population ," Saxe 
said. 

Further research is needed to 
va Iidate these fi ndi ngs and estab-
lish the long-term effectiveness of 
such an intervention. 

UC Davis To Pay For 
Housing Impact 

Amid UC Davis' on-campus 
housing expansion plan, the city 
of Davis used the recent Supreme 
Court ruling in City of Marina v. 
Board of Trustees of the California 
State University to clarify the uni -
versity's responsibility to pay for 
any off-campus impact that the 
project may cause.

Five years free checking for UCSD students.* 

City leaders and community 
activists commended the rul ing 
for forCi ng universities to look at 
the adverse effects that develop-
ment can cause, said Mary Alice 
Coleman, a me mber of a Davis 
ci tizen's gro up. 

The court decision states that 
all of California 's public colleges 
must pay loca l governments for 
the off-campus impacts of expan-
sion . 

The verdi ct doesn' t change 
anything for UC Davis, accord-
ing to campus officials - the

Report Recommends Friday Exams to Reduce Drinking 
", • RSO, from page 1 

student input on the work group, 
which consists of five upper-level 
staff members, as a major flaw in the 
report's accura~y. 

"It seemed like [the report) was just 
a lot of back-patting," Khanna said. 

He also suggested that the group 
should have taken a closer look at 
whether or not the RSO program is 
even necessary. 

"They didn't ask, '00 we need the 
RSO progtam? Why don't the other 
UC schools have them?m Khanna said. 

A focal issue of the RSO report 
was UCSD's alcohol policy, and part 
of the study was dedicated to curb-
ing underage drinking on campus 
and eliminating the "culture of alco-
hol" from causing undue trouble for 
undergraduates and campus offi -
cials. 

According to California state 
law and UC policy, underage drink-
ing on campus cannot be ignored 
when discovered and must be dealt 
with by officials. However, the 
study acknowledges that enforcing 
these policies would not necessarily 
increase popularity for whoever is 
iinplementing them. 

"The use and abuse of alcohol 
will always require an enforcement 
aspect and that enforcement com-
ponent will ultimately be considered 
by some students to be unnecessary 
and negative:' the report states. 

The report outlined a plan to 
reduce alcohol consumption focused 
on four primary goals - education, 
communication, consistency and 
commitment. 

Among the suggestions listed 
to curb underage drinking, the 
work group recommended that the 
administration implement exams 
throughout the week, including on 
Fridays. fo encourage students to 
attend class.

OPENING THE DOORS 

Early Admissions Set Up 
Unnecessary Obstacles 

By atasha araghi 
A SSOCIATE OPINION EDITOR 

Looks like the crim son school of the Ivy 
League will be living up to its trailblazing 
reputation as it takes a revolutionary and 
independent turn in it undergraduate appli-
cation process. 

Starting in the fa ll of .2008, Harvard 
University - and Princeton University, as of 
ept. 18 - will abandon their early admis-

sion programs. But as Harvard daringly says 
goodbye to the system, there is little reason to 
believe that the change will truly support diver-
sity at the campus. 

Early admission programs have drawn 
national criticism from college officials, who 
argue that the programs favor wealthy stu-
dents who are more likely to be aware of the 
option. Participation in the program increases 
the likelihood of acceptance: Harvard granted 
admission to 21 percent of early applicants last 
year, compared to an overall acceptance rate of 
around 10 percent. 

Additionally, many 'financially strapped 
students are unable to take advantage of 
early admission programs, as committing to 
a school so early reduces their ability to com-
pare aid packages at competing schools. 

" I think there are lots of very talented 
students out there from poor and moder-
ate-income backgrounds who have been dis-
couraged by this 'whole hocus-pocus of early 
admissions by many of the nation's top col-
leges; Harvard College's Dean of Admission 
William Fitzsimmons said. 

The simple boldness and passion oftheuni-
versity's officials - like that of Fitzsimmons 
- unfortunately won't be enough to bring 
about change. While Harvard's decision may 
have been motivated by a desire to increase 
opportunities for both low-income and 
minority admission seekers, the method is 
unlikely to help either cause. 

A comparison of etnnic enrollment num-
bers at Harvard to those at the University of 
Michigan, a public school without an early 

admission program, gives only modest hope 
to Harvard's plan. 

The number of Latino students enrolled at 
the University of Michigan in the fall of 2003 
was approximately 4.9 percent, according to 
the university's yearly enrollment statistics, 
with Harvard's figures close at , 7 percent. 
Moreover the numbers of blacks and Native 
Americans were also strikingly si milar, with 
Harvard at 8 percent and 1 percent, respec-
tively, while the University of Michigan had 
7.9 percent and .7 percent. 

With such a minimal difference between 
the enrollment statistics at both schools -
one with an early admission program, the 
other without - it's doubtful a shift toward a 
public school type of application process will 
bring significant change to Harvard's admis-
sions numbers. 

But officials in education circles are giving 
notning but praise to the Boston-based Ivy 
League school. 

"The most powerful institution in the coun-
try is saying, singularly, yes, something is wrong 
with this and we're going to try to act in the 
public interest," said Lloyd Thacker, the execu-
tive director of the Education Conservancy, a 
nonprofit organization committed to improv-
ing college admission processes, 

No matter how. much credit can be given 
to the university for going its own way, none 
should be convinced this is a solution to the 
problem of limited academic opportunities 
for minority and low-income students. 

Truly broadening opportunities for the 
low-income group of applicants would involve 
funding outreach programs to help educate 
disadvantaged students about the benfits of 
college and the possibilities for financial aid: 
Without this help, there's little hope that 
these students can receive a fair chance in the 
admissions process, early admission or not. 

But while it is doubtful that the termina-
tion of the early admission program will bring 
any significant change in the ethnic makeup

Universities Must Look 
Beyond the Numbers 

By Hadley Mendoza 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

It is widely acknowledged that two-thirds 
of what is learned in college comes from 
experiences outside of the classroom. That 
said, it is easy to see why college is a momen-
tous transition period (or many students. It 
is during college that students first step out 
of the protective parental bubble aI!d make 
their way into the real world. Isn't it the duty 
of one of the most prestigious universities in 
the state to help equip these young thinkers 
with real life skills that will better prepare 
them for post-college endeavors? 

If so, UCSD is doing the next generation a 
grave disservice. Instead of adopting admis-
sions techniques that will create a campus 
atmosphere reflecting that of the great big 
world around us, university officials continue 
to rely on tbeir prized point system, which 
fails to capture the intricacies of applicants 
by simply assigning them a numerical score. 
If the university ever wants to truly pre-
pare its students, the nearly 20-year-old (and 
clearly outdated) admissions system must be 
revamped. 

It's readily apparent that Asians are the 
plurality at UCSD, making up 42 percent 
of students. Meanwhile, blacks make up 
only I percent, while whites and Latinos 
find themselves in the middle at 32 and 11 
percent, respectively. Although they make 
up the lion's share of UCSD students, Asians 
represent only II percent of Californians. 
Meanwhile, whites are the bigger-picture 
plurality at 47 percent. Latinos make up 
32 percent of California's population, while 
blacks make up a much, larger 6 percent. 
Numerical discrepancies like this are hard 
to ignore, especially after glancing around 
the UCSD campus. It appears that rather 
than entering a micro biome of California'~ 
intellectual elite, students are stepping out 
of mommy and daddy's bubble and into 
another. 

So why aren't the numbers more rep-

resentative? Let's take a look at the UCSD 
admissions process. Despite its shortcom-
ings, university officials support the beloved 
point system, admiring its perceived fair-
ness and definitive nature. A computer 
assigns points for academic achievement 
and then two readers mechanically skim 
the application, assigning more points for 
personal achievement and life challenges. 
And those personal statement essays we all 
spent hours writing, revising and double-
checking for grammar? Rather than being 
judged for personal, creative or intellec-
tual expression, their contents are picked 
through for things like leadership roles 
or community service, which are assigned 
more points. Every event, achievement and 
unique experience is sifted out and assigned 
a point value. , 

Points may work for games like basket-
ball, but how can a point system accurately 
represent the many complexities of each of 
the thousands of individuals applying each 
year? 

According to a report by Washington, 
D.C:s Advisory Committee on Student 
Financial Assistance, minorities - such 
as blacks and Latinos - are concentrated 
in poorer areas and often attend schools 
that cannot afford to give their students the 
same resume-building opportunities. As 
a result, students from these high schools 
are less likely to be involved in as many 
clubs and activities and thus gain fewer 
points come college admissions time. It isn't 
because these students aren't as driven or 
as active as their more affluent peers - it's 
because their high schools Simply don't 
have the funds to provide these extracur-
riculars. 

This is why the point system falls. While 
the system rewards the most ambitious stu-
dents from prosperous areas, it ignores the 
same determination in students from poorer 
districts who are performing at the high-

sat on Pete's couch for 11 hours. 
Now what's going to happen on 
Pete's couch? Nothing." 

These ads don't exaggerate the 
physical dangers of marijuana, harp 
about its potential as a "gateway 
drug" or use the cheesy visuals that 
characterized several of the other 
ads in this year's S220-million bilin-
gual campaign. Instead, they take a 
page from the book of realism and 
argue that pot makes you, well, lazy. 

It's a new and interesting approach 
for a long line of anti-drug campaigns 
that nave largely proven ineffective 
- and hopefully a sign that attitudes 
toward the prevention of substance 
abuse are changing for the better. 

I grew up with the ~j ust say no· 
campaign, which was conceived by 
Nancy Reagan in the 1980s and 
ran into the early 1990s. The intent 
behind the campaign was noble, 
but by its very nature, was doomed 
to fail. Anyone who has spent time 
with teenagen knows that one of the 
best ways to get a teen to do some-
thing is to tell them emphatically 
not to do it. 

Not surprisingly, the "Just Say 
No" program proved largely ineffec-
tive. Even during the height of the 
campaign, there was no significant 
reduction in drug use. 

The ad campaigns of the 
D.A.R.E. program that followed 
concentrated on the physical 
effects vf chronic drug use, such . 
as the now-famous fried-egg ads 
("This is your brain. This is your 
brain on drugs."). Major studies by 
the Surgeon General's office, the 
Government Accountability Office 
and the Department of Education 
showed the D.A.R.E. campaign to 
be equally impotent at preventing 
substance abuse. 

The icing on the cake comes 
from a recent report on the inef-
fectiveness of the past few years of 

. anti-drug campaigning. A five-year 
study, sponsored by the White House 
Office of National Drug Control 
Policy and the National Institute on 
Drug Abuse. shows that exposure to 
the federal ad campaign is actually 
associated with increased marijuana 
use in some groups. According to 
the report, "greater exposure to the 
campaign was associated with weak-
er anti-drug norms and increases in 
t\le perceptions that others use mari-
juana.- Por white children and 14- to 
16-year-olds, greater exposure to the 
TV ads is associated with higher 
incidences of fITSHime drug use. 

And the sprinkles on the icing on 
the cake? This ineffective anti-drug 
ad campaign has cost the federal 

gove~ent $1.4 billion since 1998. 
(That's an "oops- with nine zeroes 
on the end, if you're counting.) 

That's not to suggest that the ad 
campaign il actually cauling kid. to

their copy of Little House 011 the

THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINIONS 

UC Regent Appointments Are Big Business 
Selection process has 
favored politicos, 
cop orate vets with 
dubious experience in 
higher education, 

By Snnua RtIllltT 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

UC students and their parents 
flOd a common trend when flipping 
through their balanced checkbooks 
- repeated inscriptions of the title 
·UC Regents.- Ptom tuition costs to 
bookstore charges to parking tick-
ets, the regents are the only banken 
circulating UC student dollars. But 
who are the ·regents'- really? 

The fint bylaw of the regenu' 
constitution declares the group 
a corporation. As such, they are 
doing wnat corporations do best 
- business - in this case, with 
students. 

While most students believe 
their regents 10 be experienced 
educators and administrators, the 
only experience most of them have 
with the UC system is their own 
past undergrad or graduate educa-
tion. 

OnJy frYe of the 26 have legiti-
mate backgrounds in the field. 

"Educate, 
Agitate, 
Organize" 

Most members of the board, which 
is granted "full powers of organiza-
tion and governance- in certain 
areas of the system according to 
Article IX of the state constitution, 
hold positions 

State University San Bernardino; 
the majority of the regents have 
little to no background in educa-
tion at all. 

These are the people designing 
today's . college 

as investors, 
trustees and 
executives of 
large corpora-
tions. 

'~8ft the people 
experience, but 
not with the 50Ie 
intention of help-
ing students or 
instilling positi~ 
values to improve 
the future . 
According to 
Schwarzenegger, 
college is meant 
instead to use 
students to boost 
the nation's econ-
omy. 

The regents 
are the success 
stories - the 
University of 
California's 
trophies, dis-
played for all 
to see. These 
are the alumni 
who made it 
big, and now 
they're trying 
to mold cur-

designing today's 
coDege experience, 

but not with the sole 
intention of helping 
students or instilling 

positive values to 
improve the future." 

"As products 
of the renowned 
UC system, 

rent students into their business 
proteges. 

The two newest appointments 
to the board are no exception. Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger nominated 
William C. De La Pena, an oph-
thalmologist and company director, 
and Bruce D. Varner, a successful 
lawyer and law-fum owner. Varner 
is a rarity, sitting on UC Riverside's 
board of trustees and the California 

William and 
Bruce uniquely understand th~ vital 
role our public universities play in 
giving students a world-class edu-
cation so they are trained for the 
21st century economy; he said. 

With the announcement of that 
goal, all undeclared students may 
as well just declare business or eco-
nomics as their major right now. 

With the power to appoint 18 
of the 26 members, the governor 

is the key player in this business 
partnership. While Article IX of 
California's constitution states that 
"the university shall be entirely 
independent of all political and 
sectarian influence and kept free 
therefrom in the appointment of its 
Regents and in the administration 
of its affairs," it makes no reference 
to the political bias of the governor 
- the sole executive to the board. 

If such if clause existed, we 
wouldn't have half of the regents 
who still serve today. . 

Is it a coincidence that Gerald L. 
Parsky and Peter Preuss, two trust-
ees of UCSD, were both appointed 
by former Gov. Pete Wilson, the 
former mayor of San Diego? Or is 
it more likely that Wi1sgn's term in 
San Diego yielded political loyalties 
to the men, or even simple famil-
iarity with them? The latter seems 
more believable. 

While this case may still be ques-
tionable, there's no doubt about the 
political influence in the appoint-
ment of Regent John J. Moores. 

Moores, the San Diego Padres 
owner, donated $100,000 to former 
Gov. Gray Davis' campaign in 1999, 
the same year he was nominated as 
a regent. In today's world, money

Anti-Drug Ads Linked to 
Higher Marijuana Use 

• DRUCS, from page 5 
trying drugs. 

Should we be surprised? 
"Just Say No" encourages a head-

in-the-sand attitude for both at-risk 
youth and their parents. While it 
may give children and teenagers a 
convenient way out of one or two 
sticky social situations, it also dis-
courages them from thinking criti-
cally and making good decisions in 
the face of peer pressure. Any teen-
ager with an anti -drug belief system 
based on easy-to-remember slogans 
will be susceptible to every bong-
toting comrade with an equally sexy 
rationalization. (Nike's "Just Do It" 
campaign springs to mind.) 

Scare tactics fare no better. 
Particularly when kids have seen 
or experienced drug use first hand, 
focusing on the worst -case effects 
of drugs can undermine credibil-
ity. In interviews designed to gauge 
the effectiveness of California's anti-
drug campaigns in the early 90s, 
children routinely laughed off the 
notion that they were being told the 
whole truth about the dangers of 
drug use, tending to view the whole 
program with dubiousness. 

Consider Montana's infamous 
"Not Even Once" anti-methamphet-
amine campaign of 1999, which plas-
tered the state with ghastly images of 
meth addicts - and which managed 
to cause a statistically significant 
increase in the number of teenagers 
who saw no risk in trying meth once 
or twice. (J n Montana's defense, the 
campaign was privately funded .) 

So what should we do with the 
next $1.4 billion? 

The thrust of the most recent 
ads would be a step in the right 
direction - if only exposure to 
ads weren't linked to greater use of 
illegal substances. Perhaps the most 
valuable lessons can be found in the 
NIDA's own recommendations for 
an ti -drug programs. 

Of the 10 examples given by the 
NIDA's pamphlet "Preventing Drug 
Use" - each of which is based on 
actual research on what is effec-
tive - only one takes direct aim at 
combating drug use itself. The other 
nine focus on encouraging involve-
ment in academics and after-school 
activities, strengthening commu -

nication between family members 
and creating a strong sense of self-
esteem, belonging and community. 

The best way to keep teenagers 
away from controlled substances is 
not to throw the scariest possible 
statistics in their face. In fact, the 
most effective anti-drug programs 
probably don't mention drugs at 
all. The greatest anti-drug comes 
from eliminating the need to resort 
to substance abuse - be that sub-
stance marijuana or Vicodin - and 
the only way to do that is through 
treating a person like the reason-
able, responsible, involved human 
being they ought to become. 

O n another front, the com-mittee responsible for reviewing the mission and 
role of Residential Security Officers 
released a preliminary report in 
early September. 

It's disappointing' that no stu-
dents served on the committee, 
particularly when the original 
Undergraduate Student Experience 
and Satisfaction report recommend-
ed that "at least" three students be 
included. (ironically, principle three , 
of the U.S.E.S. committee: "Valuing 
Students as Important Members 
and Stakeholders of the UCSD 
Community and Opening Avenues 
for Ongoing Interaction.") 

It's also disappointing that the 
committee was composed entirely 
of administrators and police officers 
who are direct stakeholders in the 
RSO program. 

But despite the lack of student 
representation and an almost laugh-
able absence of rigorous method-
ology - the report relies heavily 
on admittedly anecdotal evidence, 
without making any attempt to, say, 
verify it - the report does have a 
few promising spots. 

"The work group doesn't believe 
that efforts to 'scare straight' students 
works:' the report reads. "Effective 
communication that increase t he 
understanding of the fundamental 
principles of behavior and the use 
of alcohol here will assist with gen-
erating a community of respect, and 
should de-emphasize the need for 
heavy enforcement. 

I' ll second that.

Battle Over Mount Soledad Cross Drags On 
The long-running debate over a San Diego landmark entered a new phase thi~ ~ummer, with Congress using its power oj 
eminent domain to assume control of the Mount Soledad Easter Cross. But c"tres of the move cont~nd that the Jederal 
government had no right to involve itself - and with a new series .0J lawsuits, the controversy conttnu~s. 

Ado About Soledad 
Cross Overblown 

Like so many spats in the ongoing 
war over the separation of church 
and state, the Mount Soledad Cross 
would be thoroughly boring and 
unworthy of bothering with if it 
weren't for the things that are said 
and done in defense of it. 

Why some non-Christian and 
atheistic groups might get annoyed 
over it isn't hard to understand: it's 
a giant cross planted on one of the 
highest points in North County. 
All the talk of war memorials can't 
quite overshadow that basic point, 
and no matter how tired anyone is 
of seeing another story featuring 
Christians and the ACLU scream-
ing at each other, it probably can't 
match how tired non-Christians are 
of being expected to greet ubiq-
uitous Christian symbols with a 
smile. 

Yet as Christian influj!nces on 
communities go, the Soledad Cross 
isn't that big of a deal. It's not sit-
ting in front of a courtroom or 
government building, and it is a 
war memorial, which traditionally 
feature religious symbols. Normal 
people wouldn't waste one second 
caring whether it stays or goes. 
Constitutional lawyers aren't nor-
mal people, they are people who can 
only work out the nuances of their 
profession by forcing judges to set 
down workable guidelines for how 
many crosses you can have, how big 
they can be, if Jesus can actually be 
on the cross, etc. Fine, let them. 

From the way Christian groups 
talk, however, you<l think people 
dumped pig's blood on the cross 

and danced a naked samba 
around it. Whether or not 
religious symbols can be built 
on public lands is not a trivial 
question. yet Christian groups 
routinely greet lawsuits chal-
lenging symbols with outrage 
and cries of victimization. 

As in the furor over the 
Ten Commandments monu'-
ments in Alabama and Georgia, 
Christian leaders have taken 
public stands on the issues 
in ways that make them look 
far dumber than the plaintiffs 
ever manage. Meanwhile, non-
Christians are forced to root for 
judges to take away their toys 
until they learn to play fair.

Politics 
Again Trump 
Compromise 

Key to current haggling over 
the Mount Soledad EaSler Cross 
will be the precedents set by the 

. U.S. Supreme Court. 
The case of Lemon v. 

Kurtzman established the so-
called "Lemon Test," which 
determines if federal legisla-
tion about religion is consti-
tutionally sound. The test has 
three requirements for consti-
tutionality: fltst, the government's 
action must have a legitimate sec-
ular purpose; second, the main 
effect of the legislation must not be 
the advancement or inhibition of 
religion; and third, the legislation 
must not result in an "excessive 

[ ] 

entanglement" of the government 
with religion. . 

Whether the federal acquisition 
of the Mount Soledad site meets 
these criteria is subject to interpre-
tation, of course. And for decades, 
civil liberties groups, veterans 
groups and concerned citizens have 

tussled with each other about 
various interpretations of what 
the Mount Soledad Easter Cross 
actually means. 

Is it an endorsement of reli-
gion? Is it a war memorial? Is 
it a fantastic place to watch the 
sun come up over the hills, and 
go down over the Pacific? The 
simple answer: Yes. 

To an atheist concerned 
about his first amendment 
rights, a 50-foot cross cannot 
help but be a blatant promotion 
of one religion by the govern-
ment. To the mother whose son 
met his end somewhere north 
of the 38th parallel, the monu-
ment is an emblem of personal 
sacrifice for the greater good. 

And just as the cross' exis-
tence is a constitutional affront 
to one, its removal is nothing 
less than an insult to the other. 

Ultimately, the legality of the 
cross' presence on government 
land will be decided by an opin-
ion of a court, and not the opin-
ion of the masses. Legally speak-
ing, the impassioned bickering 
from both sides is irrelevant. But 
the cross will always be relevant 
to the people on both sides of 
the debate. 

From my non -Christian 
perspective, a strict interpre-
tation of the first amendment 
would require the cross to be 

taken down. But I have a profound 
respect for what the cross means 
to others. And to me, this respect 
for the beliefs of others is the true 
intent of the first amendment.

Simple Solution: 
Cross Must Go 

Even after 93 years, the city of San 
Diego still doesn't get it. 

Since the construction of the 
Mount Soledad Easter Cross in 191 3, 
it has caused endless argument over 
the legality of its presence on public 
property, and has br<]ught wasted 
attention to a simple, debate between 
church and state. 

ReligiOUS symbols do not belong 
on city land. And for those who 
argue that the cross was intended as 
a war memorial for the veterans of 
the Korean War, this just isn't true. In 
fact, the site did not begin to memo-
rialize veterans until 1989, 76 years 
after its construction. 

But recently federal lawmakers 
have further convoluted the situation 
by intervening, making the entire 
situation a shameful example! of the 
government's blatant disregard for 
the long-standing tradition of separa-
tion of church and state. 

After the president's recent sign-
ing of bill HR 5683, both the Mount 
Soledad National Park property and 
the cross located on the grounds will 
become federal property. 

As if it were not bad enough that 
the city was unable to disentangle 
itself from its legal battles, the federal 
government has to step in and take 
ownership of an obviously religious 
symbol. 

What will become of the battle 
now is quite another story, as the 
American Civil Liberties Union has 
gotten involved in argt.!ing again.st the 
constitutionality of the cross' pres-

Point System Overlooks Critical Qualities 
• HOLlSTlCS, from page 4 benefit to the university is well 
est level possible, given the avail- worth the cost. A college education 
able opportunities. A more holistic is one of the most effective tools for 
approach to admissions would eval- moving up the social ladder, and 
uate students in the context of their though current unrepresentative 
personal experiences and resources admissions numbers are a symptom 
- and open the university's doors 
to candid ates. 

UCLA is considering such a 
system for its admissions process, 
mimicking a similar program at 
UC Berkeley. Applications are not 
shoved into a numerical formula, 
but are instead read carefully, tak-
ing into account the interdepen-
dence of each event and experi-
ence. Readers are able to identify 
outstanding achievement despite 
limited resources. Because this 
approach recognizes students as 
individuals rather than a set of 
points to be tallied, admission offi -
cials will be better equipped to 
make fair and well -informed deci -
sions. 

With UCSD commonly ranked 
third among UC campuses behind 
UCLA and UC Berkeley, it seems 
natural to follow suit. Even though 
a holisti c approach may be more 
time-consuming - and therefore 
more expensive - th e potential

wants a school 
where we're all 

here just because 
we earned the few 
extra points for 
being Key Club 

treasurer in high 
school?" 

of a larger issue, a more holistic 
admissions system will help pro-
mote change. 

In addition to creati ng a more 
ethnica lly balanced student body, 

a better admissions system would 
ensure variation like that of the 
real world. After all , who really 
wants a school where we're all 
here just because we earned the 
few extra points for being Key 
Club treasurer in high school? 
By embracing the complexities of 
applicants rather than mechani-
cally ranking their achievements, 
the university will gain a more 
interesting and diverse student 
body. But the university will only 
be the first to gain from a better 
admissions system. 

A stronger system means more 
breadth and depth when it comes 
to the undergrad population, which 
translates to more real-world expe-
riences. UCSD will be able to boast 
not only a more interesting atmo-
sphere, but also a student body 
better equipped for a post-college 
future, through experiences with 
a wider variety of people. This is 
the time for students to move away 
from their life-at-home safety bub-
bles and push forward into a real-
world setting - and if UCSD is the 
setting they choose, the university 
has an obligation to flJ( the current 
discrepancies. 

Harvard Enters New Territory for Ivy League 
~ ADMISSIONS, from page 4 
of the university, one positive side 
effect will hopefully be felt. 

According to Derek Bok, the 
interim Harvard president, "[the end 
of early admissions 1 will improve the 
climate in high schools so that stu-
dents don't start getting preoccupied 
in their junior year about which col-
lege to go to." 

With high school students more 
stressed due to the increase in com-
petition among college applicants, it 
will be well worth the cost of chang-

ing the system, even if stress relief is 
the only improvement the decision 
will bring. 

According to an April article in 
USA Today, the record number of 
college applicants and the low admis-
sion rates of schools - especially of 
those like Harvard, Yale and Duke, 
which accept less than 10 percent of 
their applicants - force students to 
apply to more colleges. This, in turn, 
requires more work from high school 
seniors and hence a greater level of 
stress, especially considering the high 

fmancial cost of applications. 
If the end of early admission pro-

grams lights the way to a healthier 
atmosphere for green students apply-
ing for their four-year future, then 
Harvard and Princeton should be 
congratulated, even if it is eliminat-
ing the system for the wrong reasons. 
Perhaps this revolution will open 
the eyes of other early admission 
programs and universities to modify 
their policies that feed the increas-
ingly competitive struggle to get into 
college.

Students Come Up Losers in Regent Picks 
• REGENTS, from page 5 
can influence anything - including 
an appointment to the university's 
Board of Regents. 

Moores, the founder of VeSD', 
Moores Cancer Center, is the same 
man that made Fortune Magazine's 
list of "greediest" executives for 

. cashing out $611 million in stock 
to Peregrine Systems Inc., his San 
Diego-based software company. 

He has also been a laboring advo-
cate of the controversial Proposition 
209, the bill that some claim has 
contributed to the lagging numbers 

of minority students because of its 
reversal of affirmative action. 

With this kind of track record, 
it's hard to imagine how Moores 
could have merited his position 
without some form of ·political and 
sectarian influence." 

Wilson and Davis aren't alone 
in their skewed appointments; 
Schwarzenneger followed Davis' 
lead by also nominating a cam--
paign benefactor: Frederick Ruiz, 
chairman of Ruiz Food Products, 
Inc. who donated $10,000 to the 
governor's campaign in 2004. The 

relevance of Ruiz' experience to the 
position at hand is questionable at 
best. 

With 21 of 26 Regents lacking 
relevant experience in education. it's 
no smaU wonder that the University 
of California is run less like a uni-
versity and more like a business. 
And with the appointment process 
controlled by the governor - a per-
son by nature beholden to the spe-
cial interests that installed him in 
office and keep him there - should 
we be surprised if this sorry state of 
affairs continues?

ence. 

HopefuUy the supporters of the 
cro s will realize that its symbolic 
meaning would be best appreciated 
on a site where open religious favor-
iti m was more tolerated - perhaps 
the private property of a church or 
Christian organization. There they 
would be free to celebrate their faith 
without having to confront the ethics 
bf the nation.

Cross Deserves Its 
Location 

The giant cross on the ummit 
of Mount oledad has stood above 
the San Diego skyline for nearly a 
century - and there's no reason 
why it shouldn't be allowed to stay 
forever. 

Established in 1913, the cross 
ha survived numerou s attempts 
at desecration, and served as an 
impromptu Korean War memorial 
until its official dedication in 1989. 

Though the icon definitely 
serves a a symbol of the Christian 
religion, as an integral part of an 
important American memorial, it is 
now meant as a symbol of remem-
brance and hope more than as a 
symbol of Christian faith. 

~ ?Gl1ABD~ READ UCSD 

Congress was right to use emi -
nent domain to seize the land on 
which the cross is standing as well 
as the memorial surrounding it, 
which in recent years has evolved 
from a simple plaque to a more 
elaborate setup including' granite 
walls, additional plaques and a 
flagpole. 

Those who argue that the cross 
is offensive need to grow up. The 
cross is a symbol of San Diego his-
tory and the people who built it had 
no intention to offend - or convert 
- anyone. Other religious symbols

across the United States have been 
afforded federal protection as his-
torical monuments, including the 
missions along the California coast, 
which began as churches but now 
represent an important part of the 
history of the Golden tate. 

I am definitely not a religiOUS 
person and I do not identify with 
any particular religion, but I see 
no reason why the cross should be 
removed. 

True, the cro s may have begun 
with religious undertones, but the 
cross' meaning has evolved along 
with the city it elf, and now erves 
as a timeles reminder of American 
war death s. To remove it would be 
to desecrate history.

Those who argue

sive need to grow up.

First Amendment 
Violation is Clear 
The Mount Soledad Easter Cross 

is a blatant violation of separation of 
church and state, plain and simple. 
As a Ch ristian symbol, it is entirely 
inappropriate to be so prominently 

displayed in such a public area. Now 
that there is controversy, as people 
take legal action to bring down the 
cross, the religious right is up in 
arms. And with such a majority of 
people 0 apathetic these days, the 
vi tim card seem to be working. 
But it is important to not let sup-
porters of the Soledad Cross off the 
hook. 

One common argument in 
defense of the cross is that it has in 
recent years become a war memo-
rial. 

Let's get real, people. The cross, 
which has in some form existed 
atop Mount Soledad since 1913, 
has only been a war memorial 
si nce 1989 - in response to a 
lawsuit that it violated the "no pref-
erence" clause in the California 
Consti tution . 

But come on, a tiny plaque at the 
bottom of a gargantuan cross isn't 
fooling anyone. It's t rue that since 
'89 the memorial has expanded and 
now includes many plaques and 
photos, but if it's reaUy the memo-
rial that Christians are fighting to 
save, they need not worry. Let's 
keep the memorial and ditch the 
enormous, overpowering religiOUS 
symbol - easy solu tion! 

The mere fact that there is so 
much support for the cros~ clearly 
shows why it must be taken down . 
If the monument in question were, 
say, a giant star of David, it would 
have been gone long ago. But the 
Christian religious right is so domi -
nant and capable of manipulating 
the situation that people seem to 
lose sight of the law. 

The whole purpose of a separa-
tion of church and state is to deny 
any religious group a federal prefer-
ence, and that is exactly what we 
are seeing in the case of the Soledad 
Cross.

Aid for Illegals on Gov.'s Desk 
Schwarzenegger will 
have final say on bill 
greenlighting state aid 
for illegal immigrants. 

By Charles gllyen 
SENIOR STAf F WRITER 

Legislation that would make ille-
gal immigrants eligible for financial 
aid at California public colleges is 
wailing a decision by Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger: 

The bill - named the California 
D.R.E.A,M. Act - extends more 
rights to undocumented student , 
which legislators es timate num -
bered almost 600 acros the U 
system last year. 

Currently, tho -e student are 
allowed to obtain in -stale residency 
status if they meet certain criteria, 
including attendance at a aliforn ia 
high school for at least three years. 
However, undocumen ted tudcnts 
are not currently allowed to com-
pete fo r state aid, which bill author 
Sen. Gil Cedillo (D-Lo Angeles) 
said limits opportunities f r stu -
dents who usually need financial 
relief the most. 

"These students, among the best 
and the brightest young minds in 
our state, should not be punished 
for their parent's pursuit of greater 
opportu nities;' Cedillo stated in a 

press release. 
During its S.enate approval in late 

August, the legislation was attacked 
for being "unfair" and "l1at-out 
wrong:' The passing vote in the 
Legislature was mainly split along 
party lines, with most Republicans 
in opposition . Assemblyman and 
Minority Leader George Plescia (R-
San Diego) took issue with the fact 
that , if passed, the bill would give 

This is a slap in the 
face to any student 
who is here legally?' 

- Morgan Crinklaw, . 
spokesman for Assemblyman 
George Plescia (R-San Diego) 

undocumented students rights not 
granted to out -of-state students, 
who must pay higher fees and arc 
not eligible for state aid. 

"This is a slap in the face to any 
student who is here legally;' said 
Morgan rinklaw, Plescia's spokes-
man . "California has students who 
are from Arizona, the Midwest and 
everywhere around the nation. [s it 
fai r to let them get cui in line for 
financial aid?" 

The bill's pa sage would mean 
granting incentives to criminals at 

the expense of other California stu-
dents , Crinklaw said. The cost of 
'Providing aid to illegal immigrants 
in the UC sy tern would be $3.7 mil-
lion, legislative analysts estimated. 

The governor has not released any 
statements on the bill , but support-
er are hoping he continues a trend 
of providing state help to undocu-
mented youth . Schwarzenegger 
signed the current state law, which 
allows illegal immigrants to pay in -
state tuition rates, in 2002. 

In 2005, a group of nonresident 
students sued the UC sy tem, claiming 
that they were unjustly charged with 
higher tuition rates than illegal aliens. 

[n the lawsuit, which could cost 
the University of California hundreds 
of thousands of dollars in damage, 
over 40 plaintiffs contend that the 
univer ity system is violating a fed -
eral law pas ed in 1996 requiring 
colleges provide the arne level of aid 
to nonresident and undocumented 
students. 

For 2006 -07, UC officials esti-
mated that non -California students 
paid an extra 18, I 68 each in tuition 
and fees , but total cost for 2007-08 
could increa e. 

In addition, the bill would allow 
undocumented students at state 
commu nity colleges to apply for fee 
waivers.

College Groups Call Grants Too Restrictive 
• GRANTS, from page 1 
coUege officials, including De Anda, 
argue that the tWo programs have 
severely flawed rules, possibly hin -
dering the grants beyond imple-
mentation. 

The ACG and S.M.A.R.T. pro-
grams, proposed by U.S. Senate 
Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), 
were developed in order to keep the 
United States up with international 
competition in the technological 
field. 

The two programs "will also 
help America's research universities 
retain their global preeminence; 
Frist stated in a press release. "We 
need to do everything we can to 
encourage our best and brightest to 
enter key scientific fields." 

First-year college students can 
receive up to $750 from ACG, while 
second-year students are eligible for 
a maximum of $1,300; S.M.A.R.T. 
grants offer up to $4,000 to low-
income juniors and seniors. 

In 2005-06, the federal govern-
ment distributed $19.4 million in 
PelI Grants to 6,419 UCSD under-
graduates. Of these numbers. UCSD 
received $3.4 million for 1,324 ACG 
and 594 S.M.A.R.T. grant recipients, 
De Anda said. 

Low-income UCSD students who 
qualify for the Pell Grant program 
- in which eligibility is determined 
solely by financial need - are not 
necessarily eligible for the merit-
based ACG and S.M.A.R.T. grants. 
Only those who are full -time coUege 
students, u.s. citizens and maintain 
a 3.0 GPA during all four years meet 
the criteria for receiving the two 
grants. In addition, the grants only 
support fields of mathematics, sci-
ence, technology, engineering and 
critical foreign language majors at 
four-year institutions, according to 
the U.S. Department of Education's 
eligibility requirements. 

However, the stringent require-
ments have led to complaints from 

many coUege officials . 
"This exclusion lacks any statu-

tory foundation, and wiu lead to 
the differential treatment of stu-
dents attending the same school 
and having identical need profiles," 
American Council on Education 
President David Ward stated in a 
press release. "[It) creates a disturb-
ing precedent to have the [educa-
tion) department overstep statutory 
authority to effectively compel insti-
tutions to participate in the ACG 
and S.M.A.R.T. grant programs." 

The American ' Association 
of Collegiate Registrars and 
Admissions Officers and the 

. exclusion ... will 
eaa to the differentW 
treatment of students 
attending the same 

school?' 
- David Ward, President; 

American Council on Education 

National Association for College 
Admission Counseling also wrote a 
joint letter to the U.S. Department 
of Education expressing dissatisfac-
tion with the grant requirements. 

De Anda echoed some of the 
concerns about the new programs. 

"If you're going to do it and tar-
get money toward certain groups, 
all right, it's fine~ De Anda said. 
"Target certain majors - I think 
that's okay - but make everybody 
eligible for it. A lot of students who 
are engineers and scientists are for-
eign students, and they might be the 
best choices for [the) sciences and 
engineering." 

According to the Department of 
Education, students must have com-
pleted a "rigorousn secondary school 

Free Strategy Sessions 

program in order to meet eligibility for 
the ACG and S.M.A.R.T. grant - but 
De Anda stated his apprehension over 
the ambiguous interpretation of what 
qualifies as "rigorous." 

Prist stated that the criticism 
from coUege officials has no valid-
ity. 

"I see no reason to apologize for 
creating a program targeted toward 
the very type of bright. mot ivated 
students nearly all coUeges seek to 
recruit," Frist said. "I'm shocked that 
some of S.M.A.R.T. grants' critics 
appear to believe that low-income 
students can't earn good grades. " . 
The program also limits itself to 
full-time students because they pay 
the most tuition and have the great-
est financial need." 

De Anda is concerned about 
the federal government's ability to 
sustain the ACG and S.M.A.R.T. 
grants in the future, but is relieved 
to receive any extra funding regard-
less of the controversy behind it. 

"I'm glad to have the money," De 
Anda said. "Any kind of money is 
good and it's helped our students. 
It's allowed me to take self-help 
money - loans, work study, for 
example - which I'm really low on 
this year. Every doUar I get is less 
loan work to be done by students.n

UCLA Moves Toward Holistic Admissions 
Campus bucks point-
based admissions 
trend, but U CSD has 
no current plans to 
follow suit. 

By Matthew McArdle 
NEWS EDITOR 

Responding partly to campus 
concerns regarding dwindling 
minority enrollment, UCLA offi-
cials have proposed a major over-
haul to campus admissions pro-
cesses to be implemented as early 
as next year, focusing more on 
student achievement in context of 
their personal experiences. 

The campus, spurred by act-
ing Chancellor Norman Abrams 
and other faculty, may follow UC 
Berkeley's admissions policy. 

Currently, in an attempt to ensure 
objectivity during admissions selec-
tion, UCLA separates applicants' 
personal information from their 
academic history, allowing different 
readers to analyze the application in 
parts. 

The policy shift would introduce 
all of an applicant's information to 
readers at the same fime. 

A UCLA faculty committee 
approved the outline for admissions 
policy changes earlier this month, and 
although details need to be finalized, 
two mort faculty panels are expected 
to vote on the proposal soon. 

According to the Los Angeles 
TImes, after black community lead-
ers and alumni called for an over-
haul of UCLA's admissions process 
in response to the lowest number of 

However, Abrams responded that 
UCLA would continue to abide by 
Proposition 209, a 1996 initiative bar-
ring the preferential use of race and 
gender by state agencies. He also said 
that the new admissions policy would 
lead to fairer admissions standards 
for all applicants and that the change 
was not geared toward specifically 
raising black student levels. 

"In my view, this should not be 
done - and under 
California law, 

admitted black 
freshmen

since 1973, 
campus offi -
cials decided 
to introduce 

It's obvious why 
eyre doing it and 

what their 

cannot be done 
- to improve our 
African American 
admissions num-
bers, but because 
it's desirable to 
improve our pro-
cesses overall ," 

objective is?' the admissions reforms, start-
ing with a study 
ofUC Berkeley's 
policies. This 
year, 96 black 
students were

UC regent and proponent of TImes. 

Proposition 209 In response, 

likely to enroll, 
comprising just 2 percent of UCLA's 
entering class. 

"It's hard for big institutions to 
make 9O-degree turns while driving 
70 mph, and I'm proud of my alma 
mater for doing that," Peter Taylor, a 
Los Angeles businessman and promi-
nent black UCLA alumnus, told the 
TImes. 

Ward Connerly, 
tJe conservative 

former UC regent who was a chief 
proponent of Proposition 209, said 
that UCLA had the right to change its 
procedures according to state law and 
UC guidelines. However, he shrugged 
off the idea that UCLA was not mak-
ing the change as a result of the racial 
admit numbers, saying it "doesn't pass 
the giggle test." 

"It's obvious why they're doing it 
and what their objective is," Connerly 
told the TImes. 

At UCSD, admissions practic-
es will continue to be conduct-
ed according to the University of 
California's "comprehensive review· 
policy, a rule allowed to be inter-
preted as each campus deems fit 
and in which personal factors are 
considered along with grades and 
standardized test scores, accord-
ing to Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Admissions and Registration Mae 
W. Brown. 

"The university will continue to 
look broadly at a number of fac-
tors; Brown said, including low fam -
ily income, first-generation college 
attendance, community service and 
special challenges. 

In addition, Brown said that 
UCSD's current point-based admis-
sions policy would remain in effect 
through next year but did not rule 
out the possibility of a 200S poli-
cy change, which would have to be 
approved by the campus' committee 
on admissions, which consists of sev-
eral faculty members and is respon-
sible for overseeing and amending 
admissions criteria.

working on college newspapers 
deserve the same righ ts afforded 
to every other student journalist.N 

Incidentally, high school students 
already gained First Amendment 
protections in the Hazelwood 
School District v. Kuhlmeier 
Supreme Court decision. 

However, college students 
were not included in the discus-
sion until the dean of an Illinois 
university halted the publication 
of a student article because of 
its criticisms of the administra-
tion . The dean then estab lished a 
requirement demanding adminis-
trator approval prior to printing; 
however, the 7th Circuit Court 
found the mandate unconstitu-
tional, in Hosty v. Carter, revers-
ing the decision in favor of the 
students. The law, which removes 
restraint from university publi-
cations, wi II take effect January 
2007. 

Campus Gains New 
Vice Chancellors 

Among other transitions this 
summer, two vice chancellor slots, 
have been filled in the offices of 
student life and external relations. 

Out of three candidates, 
campus veteran Cary R. Ratcliff 
was chosen as vice chancel-
lor of student life. While most 
students know Ratcliff because 
of his involvement with the 
Student-Run Television negotia-
tions, his six years at UCSO also 
include involvement in Student 
Organizations and Leadership 
Opportunities, serving as chair for 
the UC Advisory Board and push-
ing for the Price Center Expansion 
project through his position as 
director of University Centers. 

Keith E. Brant, formerly UCLA's 
assistant vice chancellor for alum-
ni relations and executive director 
of the UCLA alumni association, 
will have the responsibility of 
attracting outside financial support 
to the university, strengthening 
UCSO's relationships with alumni 
and other donors and building 
UCSO's regional reputation . 

Brant brings qualities of col-
laborative leadership and strate-
gic planning, which he will use to 
boost UCSD's alumni backing. 

UC, Google Digitize 
Student BOOKS 

The University of California 
became the latest partner in the 
Coogle Books Library Project, 
which was launched in December 
2004 to digitize books drawn 
from the libraries of the University 
of Michigan, Harvard, Stanford, 
Oxford and the New York Public 
Library. 

The project will provide online 
access to all of the University of 
California's public domain books, 
including many rare, historic and 
special collections . 

The 1 DO-plus I ibraries on the 
10 UC campuses comprise the 
largest research/academic library 
in the world . Merging with the 
Ca lifornia Digital Library shows 
the UC system's leadership in har-
nessing support of new and inno-
vative forms of scholarly commu-
nication, said John Oakley, chair 
of the University of California's 
system-wide Academic Senate. 

"In this new world, our fac-
ulty, staff and students will make 
connections be tween informa-
tion and ideas that were hitherto 
inaccessible, driving the pace of 
scholarly innovation and enhan -
ing the usc that is made of our 
great libraries," Oakley said.

Sec .... ,..... ........ 

PAY for college 
Program Overview 

Student Securities are a new financial instrument created specifically to give every 
student the funds ,they need to attend college. There are unique features and benefits, 
yet unlike traditional student loans, there is no principal or interest component. 

Comparison Chart 
Student Securities 

J ·There are no interest rates. 

A fixed payment percentage 
always reflects your ability to 
pay. Pay less when you have 
less and more when you have 
more. 

When your payment term ends, 
so does your obligation to pay 
anything more, reQardless of 
what you have paid. 

An eamings-based, flexible 
payment obligation gives you 
the freedom to take healthy 
risks, pursue entrepreneunal 
endeavors. or change 
professions entirely. 

Financing is dependent on your 
merit. 

x 

Traditional Student Loans 

There are interest rates which 
vary based on economic 
fluctuations. Rates can be as 
high as 8.25% for federal loans, 
or higher for private loans. 
Credit card rates can be as high 
as 22%. 

Varying monthly payments do 
not retrect your present 
economic situation, but are 
based on economic 
fI uctuations. 

~ The only way to lower 
payments is to extend the term 
which also increases the 
interest you will owe. 

x Large debt burdens can restrict 
the pursuit of innovative career 
options or the ability to change 
professions or jobs. 

x Most traditional student loan 
eligibility depends on your 
family's income and credit 
worthiness.

Students to Be Moved as 
Space Becomes Available 

• ENROLLMENT, from page 1 
Hall received a $5-million facelift 
to accommodate the incoming resi-
dents, according to Muir Dean of 
Student Affairs Patty Mahaffey. 

"The entire hall was gutted;' 
Mahaffey said. 

The building was repainted , the 
bathrooms redone and rooms that 
were altered to house three stu-
dents were given new armoires and 
desks. In addition, the building was 
updated to obey fire codes and dis-
abled-access laws. 

In total , Muir will include 145 
"plus-one spaces," or rooms that 
were converted to triples, as well 
as 180 single rooms and 43 double 
rooms, Mahaffey said . 

Some students will also be housed 
in hallway storage rooms that have 
been converted 

assigned room in most cases:' 
The Student Affairs office has 

allocated additional money to all 
six colleges, according to Mahaffey, 
with 5250 extra given to each house 
in Mu ir. 

However, the university still does 
not know if it will receive more state 
funding to accommodate the stu -
dent influx. 

"We are working within the cur-
rent funding provided to UCSD;' 
Brown stated in an e-mail. "The dis-
tribution of overenrollment funds 
will not occur until later in the year 
if at all." 

Although the unexpected number 
of incoming students has undoubt-
edly affected university housing, 
Brown stated that UCSD has made 
every effo{t to provide sufficient 

faU-quarter class 
into living spac-
es, although 
Mahaffey said 
efforts would 
be underway 
to relocate stu-
dents who have 
been housed in 
those rooms if 
additional space 
becomes avail -
able.

offerings and 
that no freshman 
should expect his 
or her degree-
attainment time 
to be affected. 

" In a small 
number of cases 
students may have 
to wait until win-
ter quarter to take 
some classes, but 
there should be a 
sufficient number 

Many stu -
dents have even

Student Affairs, 

John Muir College 

been relocated to other colleges for 
living arrangements. Revelle College 
is currently housing 166 M}lir fresh -
men, according to Mahaffey, and 
Black Hall in Earl Warren College 
will serve as home to numerous 
Muir sophomores. 

The university will attempt to 
relieve dorm overcrowd ing by reduc-
ing the number of students housed 
in triple rooms over the course of 
the year as spaces open for various 
reasons, including instances where 
students decide to leave UCSD or 
otherwise terminate their housing 
contracts. 

"Students who are placed in tri-
ples will be untripled as permanent 
spaces open up by their college res-
idence life offices: UCSD Housing 
and Dining Services Director Mark 
P. Cunningham stated in an e-mail. 
"Otherwise, they will remain in their 

of seats in classes for all students to 
carry full loads," Brown stated. 

Mahaffey said that Muir has 
added eight additional sections to 
the Muir College Writing Program, 
and that the lack of classroom space 
was the main factor in not adding 
more. 

"There are lots of students who 
got the classes they wanted. and 
there are also lots of waitlisted stu-
dents;' Mahaffey said. "It's kind of a 
mixed bag." 

Although space in housing and 
classes has been crunched, the extra 
students are a welcome addition , 
Mahaffey said. 

"Muir's a very popular college. 
but we just didn't realize how popu-
lar," she said. "It's a compliment:'

Sports Could Improve Student Life, Gohd Says 
~ VOll, from :I~ 
ica departmmt's budget. while 
also inc:ludina the $6 per student per 
quarter needed to fund pnts-in-aid. 

The original proposal drew funds 
from reptratioo fees; hOWlMr. last 
April. the Academic Senate decided 
switch the funding method to an 
increued student fee. Athletics DIrector 
Earl W Edwards ca11ed the chanae 
abrubt, and said that the senate bowed 
to preuwe from graduate studenu who 
wanted to opt out of the rqpstntion 
fee-bued system. Edwards also cited 
increased demands 00 registrItion fees 
as another reason for the rniaion. 

According to former Senate 
Council Chair Jean-Bernard Minster. 
the change was also made because 
administrators were unsure if students 
were willing to pay more to float the 
department 

A.S. Comnussioner of Athletics 
Kari Gohd interprets the modification 
as a test but embraces it nevertheless as 
an opportunity fur student empower-
menl 

"This can show the adminiItration 
that what [1tUdeots) want IhouId be 
under conaidention.- Gobd said. "Thla 
is a reaDy important time to show tIuIt 
[students) care and are motivated to 
make student Uk better and have a say 
in what goes on at this university." 

While most students believe that 
athletics is the cornerstone of school 
spirit and campus life, according to 
A.S. President Harry Khanna, the 
Academic Senate isn't as sure. 

This question has been debated 
so heavily among councllmembers 
that the objectM of the proposa1 was 
cIwnged last SllIJJIDer to simply comply 
with the NCAA mandate ralber than 
confront the compJicated issue of stu-
dent discontent. according to Conner 
touncil member Morton Printz. 

"Students' concerns about their 
social ~ Id UCSD is a serious 
[issue] that is more~ than par-
ticipation in sports.. Minster said. "The 

facu1ty are in strong support of efforts 
to improve the student aperience. but 
of coune there are di&ring opinions 
on how to go about doing that In an 
environment with limited ~ 
fee funding for many worthy causes_~ 

While the senate aims to \.lie the 
proposal to sustain the department and 
remain in DivisIon n. the A.S. Council 

f .f:.:::'w the 
• .. ·on that 

what [students] want 
should be under 
oonsideration." 

- Kari Gotid, 
AS. Commissioner of Athletics 

has I1IOR ambitious plana that it hopes 
will diIKtIy enhance student Uk. 

"The pi for the lCA fee incrase. 
Inducllng Idditional grants-in-aid 
funds. is not just to fix the budeet 
probImu." abe said. "[It is aIIo) to 
form a pIIh of growth so that our 
prosrams can do better and haft the 
best opportunitla to succeed and win 
championships.-

The A.S. Council is basing its plan 
on findings such as those from the 
Undergraduate Student Experience 
and Satisfllction Committee, ICCOrding 
to Gohd. Among sugestions on ways 
to enhance the campus envirorunent, 
the rq>art recommended more focus 
on athletics. 

A stJ'onFrprogram would ~ 
UCSD's recruitment and reputation. 
Gohdsald. 

"I wish students around the coun-
try knew about how cool [UCSD) is 
instead of just how mwt the school is," 
she said. "College isn't just about aca-
demics anymore. Students, especially 
those who go to a Uc, expect more 

than just a p!Od. strong academic pro-
gram." 

Edwards mentioned the way 
advanced athletics and academics can 
go hand in hand. 

"As soon as we IIIOWd to Division 
II. we started competing for students 
intaated in Ivy Leagues.- Edwards 
said. "Were!!dting more elite students 
now. on top of better teaJm." 

No matter how stroosIY some peo-
ple feel about the positiw impact of 
a strong athledc program. the final 
decision depends on the mobiIizIdion 
of students. which has proven dial· 
1enging in put e1ectioos. 

The rUerendum requires a 20-per-
cent voter turnout, with a majority of 
those students in favor of the incrased 
leA activity fee. 

While 20 percent may seem sma1L 
only 17.3 percent of the student body 
voted in the last A.S. election. even 
with extensive campaigning and cover-
age from the Gtuudian. Gobel said. The 

_ A.S. Council and the IdhIdics depIrt-
menl still remain positM. however. 
noting the successful turnout In 2002, 
which yielded 70 percent of wta in 
fawr of the student-initiated referm-
dum to implement the lCA activity fee 
originally. 

The current vote will occur around 
eighth 'oftek Qf fall quarter to decide 
whether supporting intercollegiate 
athletics is important. according to 
Khanna. 

"[The administration) is saying. if 
you really want this enough, you need 
to show you want it;' Gohd said. "If we 
rise to the occasion. it will say a lot" 

In the meantime, the atbIetica 
department will assess Ita ftDances in 
order to decide on a sufBcient increase. 
They don't have an estimIIe It this time; 
howrm-. more detaib 00 the dIIla and 
terms of the referendum IhouId be 
available in the upcoming weeks.

edeski Martin & Wood are light-years from elevator

pump of Hammond organ and flicker of keyboard send 
warm chills through the core. The avant~garde trio was first 
exposed by a number of performances with Phish carlyon 
in thei r career, a connection that identified them as part of 
the jam band scene by association. They are jammers in 
thei r way - their soulful, mysteriOUS way of building static 
anticipation in and around the stage. If you're the televi-

with some soulful honeys from self-run label Ariwa

some mighty catchy beats to back them up. I guess it's just that

A hoard of canoes, jet skis, surf-boards and rowboats exploding over the Pacific Ocean; a cartoon 
skeleton cloaked with Abu Ghraib 
garb - i.e .. a dunce hat and a pon-
cho. 

Such images, a whimsical play 
on American culture and politics, 
are the latest exhibitions (and film 
screening) presented this month at 
the Museum of Contemporary Art, 
San ~iego. Two pieces by American 
artists Nancy Rubins and Robert 
Irwin, addressing the San Diego 
regional identity and landscape, and 
"Toon Town Troublemakers; from 
the MCASO's fIrst annual animated 
short ftlm festival, make up the best 
of this month's programming. 

Sculptor Nancy Rubins' per-
manent piece at the Museum of 
Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, 
titled "Chas' Stainlesss Steel, Mark 
Thompson's Airplane Parts, About 
1,000 Pounds of Stainless Steel Wire, 
and Gagosian's Beverly Hills Space 
at MOCA," made specific reference 
to the Sept. 11 attacks. Now, she 
creates a less political, more cultural 
piece that gives special homage to 
the beach culture that has come to 
define San Diego. Attached to the 
roof of the museum, the composition 
of boats, canoes and jet skis cascades 
across the sky and dangles just above 
visitors' heads. By placing the ship 
parts just above eye level, rather than 
below vistors' feet or on the edge of 
their horizon line, Rubins realigns 
our view of the oceanscape and intro-
duces us to a breathtaking play of 
tension and gravity, Titled ·Pleasure 
Point," the Site-specific piece reminds 
us of the core passion that most San 
Oiegans harbor: a love of the ocean. 
The work is an ongoing c:xhibition 
and is on view at the west side of the 
MCASD La Jolla facility. 

Paying further homage to the 
San Diego cultural makeup is the 
ongoing exhibition TRANSactions:

At the first and sanest moment of the Holocaust's career, he appeared as a brooding, shack-
led 17-year-old spitting alongside 
Ghostface Killah, Dr. Doom and 
swarming bikini bitches in one of 
the RZA's late-'90s Bobby Digital vid-

and KilJa Beez spots - and, for 
the last few years, forum hounds 
tracking his every lazy verse under 
alias Warcloud - that's pretty much 
where the unsolved Wu-Tang prodi-
gy left hip-hop hanging.

into a full-fledged recording session. 

Brown has aged into an odd breed 
of articulate brute; his literal Animal 
Planet and History Channel narrations 
are washed with primitive, bloody war 
threats from the noble fantasy novels 
in his head. BSBO's controlled orches-
tration is not overly repeti,tive, yet at 
the same time avoids self-indulgent 
complications and strayings from 
the Holocaust's marching lyrics. as it 
watches him try to fit too many words 
into a line and dig too deep into odd 

French duo, whose mix of punk.

finding and illuminating the charm in 
a gruff, disorganized flow. 

The pretty vocal samples. sym-

the buzzing duo's freshman release, 
and their noise could not have found 
a better personality to match its fasci-

HIATUS EDITOR 

In 2004, French duo Marc Collins 
and dlivier Libaux introduced their 
eponymous album of disreputable 
lyrics and bossa nova melodies, then 
embraced with unexpected world 
success. Featuring intriguing titles 
such as "Sorry for Laughing; "This 
Is Not a Love Song" and "Too Drunk 
to Fuck;' their songs are crooned 
compositions which pay homage to 
the sounds of Brazil. 

Their follow up album Bande a 
Parte is a further teasing of 13 punk 
and new-wave songs, mingling svelt.e 
1940s Cari bbean strings with the 
darker music of the '80s. Imagine: 
a young blind girl singing Visage's 
.. Fade to Grey" in the corridors of the 
Parisian Metro, alone with her accor-
dion, ignored by everyone ... and 
a young Jamaican with his acoustic 
guitar singing "Heart of Glass" in his 
Kingston township - two defmitive 
images for CoUins that became the 
genesis of Nouvelle Vague's second 
album. 

By repackaging punk gold like 
Buzzcock's "Ever Fallen in Love," 
New Order's "Blue Monday' and 
Sound's "I Can't Escape Myself;' 
snarls have been replaced with 
breathy chanteuses, and, to best 
quole Andrew Viner, "previously 
unimagined qualities of these clas-
sics have become apparent." 

ACari bbean flavor permeates 
the group's elegant version of the 
Blondie staple, while an unexpect-
ed mating of European gothic and 
Haitian voodoo in Bela Lugosi's 
"Dead" and a soulful swing through 
Yazoo's " Don't Go" showcase 
Nouvelle Vague's innovative appeal 
as playful and quirky interpretators 
of dark, dense classics. 

With a nod to seaside ska, reg-
gae and Haitian voodoo, the album 
undermines the group's original 
consistency with bossa nova. but 
still retains enough of its lilting 
acoustic guitars, Gaulolse smokiness 
and jazt seductions to keep old-tim-
ers happy.

CAst' THEUSTOFSE BER Johnny Cash 

• American V: A Hundred Hjpways 
LOST ltIGItIIMy 

*** The legends of American music are enveloped in a force field of respect that transcends eri-
tique and general standards - any 
material they offer to us mortals 
is treated d ifferently than if it had 
come from an unknown. 

Though this is perhaps unfair, it 
is, in this case, deserved. Over his life-
time, Johnny Cash narrated decades 
of. the poor, humble man's experi-
ence, connecting with the nation on 
a level that held sturdy through the 
last of his days. The dying strains 
and painful reminiscences handed 
down to us here from a man we so 
love and admire carry an epic sor-
row and strike chords of painful age 
inside ourselves that a newcomer or 
imitator could never reach. 

Cash's last album, the eerily 
posthumous A Hundred Highways, 

. , 

doesn't reach the range or skill of 
any other in the American series, 
but an added element of untouch -
able greatness reverberates through-
out the collection (mostly covers) 
detailing what was most important 
in Cash's life: His wife and lover, 
June Carter Cash, a simple country 
life and newfound faith. 

Producer and dear friend Rick 
Rubin keeps the background small 
to illuminate the withering rumble 
of what will be a forever-recogniz-
able voice, singing to its people with 
all remaining breath. If death made 
sound, it would be Johnny Cash 
steadily pushing out the lost-tune 
finishing line of the album: "But I'm 
free from the chain gang now."

Justin Timberlake 
• Futuresexllovesounds 
JIVE 

It's a trend: Justin Timberlake wants to make music, and big names fol -low. Four years ago, the boy-band-
er made his semi-self-titled debut in 
Justified - a bitter, funky mixture 
of club romps and int.im.ate confes-
sionals composed by MTV-familiar 
names like Pharrell and Timbaland. 
Now, Futuresex/Loverounds' resume 
of producers is simpler, but by no 
means less talented. Timbaland's 
reunion with Timberlake in the pro-
duction room - for all but two songs 
on the album - has made a sweet 
sound that is love child to the twang 
of Rick James and the magnetism 
of Prince. The addictive synthesis 
makes electronica a mainstay ingre-
dient throughout the album, as heard 
in the robotic and undeniably showy 
"SexyBack.-

Still, only the most idealistic would 
expect an introspective effort from 
an 'NSync graduate. This album is all 
about pioneering and cutting-edge 
ambience, courtesy of Timbaland, 
that buttresses Timberlake', soulful 
falsetto. The producer, ex-partner of 
Magoo, takes garish command of 
tracks like ·Chop Me Up~ where 
the gangster bass of Three Six Mafia 
meets Timberlake's soothing tone. 

, Then there's -What Comes Around." 
bringing an exotic funk thats stays on 
hand for the rest of the album. 

Strip away Timbaland and Rick 
Rubin, though. and the record is a 
bare-boned. unenthusiastic attempt 
at maturity (gasp - the post-Justified

GHOSTS N THE MACH NE 
By Marntlte Federis 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

W hen Revelle College senior Modesta Diego found out she was accepted to 
UCSD, she said she was excited to 
be going into the UC system after 
all her hard work in high school. But 
during her first week at school, as 
she walked around campus for the 
first time, she began to notice some-
thing she wasn't expecting. Used to 
everyday life in diverse communities 
in East Los Angeles and Downey, 
Diego realized how few Latino stu-
dents there were on campus. 

"Once I started walking around 
campus, it was undeniable; Diego 
said. "Going to UCSD ~as a culture 
shock. It made me miss home more 
and I started to regret my decision:' 

Diego spent the rest of her fresh -
man year going home on weekends, 
only minimally involved on campus. 
But now, in her senior year, Diego 
is the new chair for Movimiento 
Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan, 
a Latino student advocacy group. 
Today, she works with the organi-
zation to try and reach out to high 
school students from minority com-
munities and convince them to go 
to UCSD. 

"A lot of [students of color] are 
accepted, but when they ask a rela-
tive, a friend from high school -
there are always negative reactions," 
Diego said. 

The number of underrepre-
sented students in the UC system 
has lagged for decades. And then, 
in 1996, California voters passed 
Proposition 209, w.hich prohibited 
the U C system from using race as a 
factor in its admission process. The 
controversial initiative launched a 
series of lawsuits, ignited campus 
protests across the state and spurred 
furt her debate over affirmative 
action. 

Ten years after Proposition 209 

took effect, the dispute continues. 
Even before the initiative passed, 

the UC regents approved resolu-
tions called SP-1 and SP-2, which 
also banned preferential treatment 
based on race, sex, color, ethnicity 
or national origin. Those who sup-
ported the initiative and resolutions 
claimed the UC system was giving 
an unfair advantage to certain stu-
dents over others. 

Former UC Regent Ward 
Connerly was the co-author of the 
proposition and was among the lead-
ers who pushed for the initiative's 
passage. According to Connerly,

Yearly beach report shows San Diego 
beaches have been getting healthier. 

By Matthew Leavitt 
ASSOCIATE FOCUS EDITOR 

Beach conservationists, of all environment-oriented groups, have perhaps the eas-
iest time raising awareness for their 
cause. Theirs is a fight for a natural 
resource that everyone loves and 
enjoys, is a central source of enter-
tainment and which has become 
a state icon. A threat to the health 
of the beach is easy to parlay into 
a threat to everyone, and as such it 
is a favori te cause of politicians and 
environmental groups alike. Sewage 
dumps, untreated water runoff and 
beachgoers themselves are all ci ted 
as a constant threat to the sanitation 
of the sea and shore. The state of 
our beaches, we are told, is perilous 
and usually getting worse. However, 
recent beach reports from nonprofit 
organization Heal the Bay argue 
that, at least in San Diego, condi-
tions are a lot cleaner than some 
would have thought. 

One of the most prominent poli-
ticians in San Diego's beach conser-
vation movement is city council-
member Donna Frye, who has been 

rallying for cleaner water since the 
mid-'90s. Si nce the beginning of 
her campaign for cleaner beaches, 
the waters of San Diego have expe-
rienced a sanitation revolution. [n 
an article published in the July 2006 
edition of National Geographic, 
"Loving Our Coasts to Death," Frye 
explained her inspiration to become 
the vanguard of San Diego's beaches. 
"I did some research and found out 
nearly all the popular surf spots 
were in front of storm drains or 
river mouths," she said. 

Due to the untreated water com-
ing from these drains, the levels of 
bacteria in popular surf spots were 
once much higher than state regula-
tions allow. According to National 
Geographic, "[Frye found] total 
coliform bacteria counts - which 
should be below 1,000 organisms 
per 100 milliliters of water for safe 
swimming - as high as 1.6 million 
organisms; counts of sewage-loving 
fecal coliform - which should be 
below 200 organisms for safe swim-
ming - as high as 240,000." It is 
important to note that the statistics

A decade ago, Californians dismantled

but did we get the color-blind 
system we were promised? 

of minority students in the UC 
system is a tragic consequence of 
the initiative, the system should 

focus on other factors to entice 
students. 

"There needs to be profound cul-
tural change to reverse tragic circum-
stance of so few [minority students] 
going to universities," Connerly said. 
"Let's focus on what we have to do 
to encourage people to lead produc-
tive lives." 

He said Proposition -209 pro-
duced some positive results, like an 
increase in Asian students. At UCSD, 
the number of Asian students has 
increased from 27 to 47 percent. 
Supporters argued that minority 
students might also feel ashamed 
if race was one of the reasons they

·Prop. 209 removed stigma 

attached to black, Hispanics [and] 
Native American kids," Connerly 
said. -There's no doubt how they 
got there.-

But opponents of Proposition 
209 say the impact of the initiative 
was immediate and overwhelmingly 
negative, namely a decrease in the 
amount of minority studeJ1ts admit-
ted to the state's universities. In 
1995, black students were 2 percent 
of UCSD's population. Last year, it 
was only 1 percent. Latinos were 
9 percent of the population in the 
mid-'9Os - now they are at 8 per-
cent. 

"Prop. 209 [made] an already bad 
situation a hundred times worse,"

Proposition 209 prohibited 
state institutions from discriminat-

the only source of fecal coliform for 
Black's Beach would have to be the 
houses on the cliffs dumping cham-
ber pots directly into the water, or 
free-range nudists squatting in the

of affluent denizens would seem the 
more likely target for beach conser-

has been causing 
problems in fast

across the United 
States for years. 

Conservation 
organizations 
exist to remind 
us that areas like 
beaches need 
preservation and 
protection. What's 
easy to forget is 
how well these 
organizations 
may be doing 
their job. Heal 

When Heal the

the lowest rank-
ing locations 
were the Tijuana 
River Slough and 
parts of Mission

local beaches, 
Black's Beach 
and La Jolla 
Shores, received

most recent Weekly

and Pacific Beach all

the Bay, a nonprofit organization 
aimed at monitoring and rehabili-
tating unsanitary beaches, affirmed 
the sanitation of popular San Diego 
beaches in its 2006 report. 

Heal the Bay began in 1985 when 
a group of people joined together to 
fight for the sanitation of the Santa 
Monica Bay. Since then, it has grown 
into a nonprofit watchdog that 
grades Southern California beaches 
on water-quality. The organization 
works in conjunction with local 
government agencies, including the 
County of San Diego Department of 
Environmental Health and the City 
of San Diego, to monitor the levels 
of contaminants in local waterways. 
According to the Heal the Bay's 
Annual Beach Report Card for 2006, 
San Diego is passing with flying 
colors. 

Those who traverse the cljffs of 

tively. Even the 
notoriously filthy Pacific Beach Pier 
received a C, up from last yeai's F. As 
of Sept. 8, when Heal the Bay con-
ducted its most recent Weekly Report 
Card, La JoUa Shores, Black's Beach 
and Pacific Beach aU had As. Overall, 
San Diego beaches su rpassed those of 
Orange County and Los Angeles for 
water quality. 

While San Diego and its compet-
ing cities have experienced slumps 
in their tourism in past years. the 
San Diego Convention and Visitors 
Bureau projects growth in cruise 
and botel sectors for 2006. Tbere is 
no doubt that the life and sanitation 
of San Diego's beaches correlates 
directly with the life of its touris~ 
industry and it is in the region's best 
interest to pay attention to them. 
Like it (lr not, they are the ODe 
resource that most directly affects 
San Diego's future.

W hilethe hearty break-fast remains one of 
our favorite meals, it can 
also be one of the most 
tedious to cook. Mixing 
pancake batter, frying 
bacon, brewing coffee and 
the surveillance required 
for cooking perfect, sunny 
side up or poached eggs 
are an ordeal at 8 a.m. But 
thankfully, Le Peep Grill, 
just one of San Diego's 
many breakfast-joint jew-
els, will save the day and 
offer that homemade 
taste with a smile and a 
slim price. 

Though its name might 
suggest differently, Le 
Peep Grill is more famous 
for its breakfast items 
than forits lunch and din-
ner menu. With almost 
all of its morning dish-
es under $8, locals flock 
to the humble, country-
home style restaurant for 
a heaping share of eggs 
benedict and its famous 
Gooey buns. Most dishes, 
including the omelets 
and benedicts come with 
a choice of country-fried 
potatoes or fruit salad.

With its affordable price, friendly service and utterly cute name, Le Peep is perfect 
for students asking for a hot breakfast without compromising their budget. If that 
doesn't sound Ie delish, then you can always toil away in the kitchen or opt for the 
usual stale breakfast at the di.ning halls.

Environment Factors Into Low 
Minority Admission Levels 

~ 

-----------------------------~ 

: Sunshine Store Coupon : 
I I 
~ ACTION, from page 28 
admis ion committees were able to assign 
about 300 points oul of a possible 11 ,000 if 
they are from an underrepresented group. 
Opponents said thai while those points were 
assigned, general academic performance has 
always been the largest factor in why students 
were accepted. 

According to Mariscal. who was part of 
UCSD's admission committee in the after-
math of Proposition 209. committees and 
classrooms ended up censoring themselves in 
the effort to comply with the new law. 

"It generated a lot of time and energy 
trying to deal with it, but 

which discourages students from enrolling 
in the relatively expensive UC system. But 
ultimately, he said, a large pari is due to the 
unwelcoming atmosphere in which students 
of color find themselves. 

"So there are a lot of things leading to 
the poor numbers:' Mariscal said. "There's a 
general sense that IUCSD] is a place for an 
elite population. You even meet working class 
Mexican-American families who say well I 
always thought UCSD was a private schoo!:' 

For Diego, belonging to a community is 
part of college development. She said for 
Latinos like herself, the experience at UCSD 

could be a very difficult 
one. now we're also spending a 

lot of time trying to make 
sure we're not violating it,· 
Mariscal said. "It has cre-
ated a censorship mecha-
nism inside the university, 
where people are always 
worrying about Prop. 209, 
which I think is extremely 
negative." 

Some opponents also 
said the initiative created a 
harsh climate for students 
of color. 

"The impact was even 
stronger; Mariscal said. 
"Not only couldn't we let 
people in who would have 
come otherwise, students 
got the idea that they weren't 
wanted here." 

position 209] 
enerated a lot of time 
and energy trying 
to deal with it, but 

now wf!re spending a 
lot of time trying to 
make sure wf!re not 

violating it?' 

"II makes it harder to 
stay here, even though I'm 
fully capable [of] being in 
classes, I can never feel that 
sense of comfort,· Diego 
said. 

According to Mariscal, 
who was a member of the 
UCSD committee formed 
to find ways to encourge 
minority enrollment, some 
of the suggestions included 
visible black or Latino stud-
ies programs and stronger 
financial aid packages. 

Diego said increasing 
the number of underrep-
resented faculty and staff 
members could also help 
address the issue. But it is a 

- Professor Jorge Mariscal, 
former member oT the UCSD 

admissions committee 

And it is this kind of 
climate that students and administrators are 
trying to offset. Mae W. Brown, the vice chan-
cellor of admissions and registration, said 
that while many underrepresented students 
are accepted into the university, many are 
choosing to go elsewhere. This past year, for 
example, 353 black students were accepted at 
UCSD, but only 48 decided to enroll. 

Mariscal accounts for such low numbers 
by citing a lack of sufficient frnancial aid, 

• i 

chicken and egg dilemma. 
Studies have shown, he said, that even when 
UCSD hires new faculty of color, the same 
number of members leave because of, among 
other things, campus climate issues and per-
ceived lack of support. 

·What the administration can do, even 
though I know they're limited because of Prop. 
209, is scouting for more qualified underrep-
resented faculty and staff that understand 
how minority students feel," Diego said.

time. 

In the first three-minute overtime. 
Pepperdine University scored first. 
looking like it would hold off to win 
the tournament. but again the Tritons 
put the ball in the back of the net 
just before the 'buzzer went off with 
Lackeis goal. 

After a scoreless second overtime. 
the two teams faced off in a sudden-
death. UCSD won the sudden death 
sprint but could not connect on its 
first possession. 

It came down to crunch time, 
with I minute. 7 seconds remaining, 
CaseUini made the game-winning 
goal to give the Tritons the champi-
onship, 

Over the course of the Inland 
Empire Tournament on Sept. 16-17.

18. defeating Whittier College 15-5, 
No. 15 University of Redlands 9·5, 
Cal Lutheran University 12·3 and 
Pomona-Pitzer CoUeges 21 -5. 

It didn't take the Tritons long to 
get comfortable with a new roster 
as many players made contributions, 
inciuding Lackey. who had 13 goals 
for the tournament. 

On Sept. IS, UCSD experienced 
its first loss against No. 4 Stanford 
University in a close game, 8- 11, after 
winning eight consecutive games. 

Randall made 18 saves in goal, 
but it wasn't enough, as the Cardinal 
scored three times in the last four 
minutes. Overall, Stanford improved 
its season record to 3 ·0. 

"We had a great chance to beat 
them, but little mistakes cost us the 
game," Dordoni said. 

UCSD kept building leads while 

Stanford kept tying it up. With first· 
period goals by senior utility Jesse 
Casellini and junior driver Adnan 
Jerkovic, the Tritons were up 3-1 in 
the second period. 

A couple of Cardinal players 
scored to tie the game at 3-3, but 
UCSD once again went up by two on 
goais by CaseUini and senior 2-meter 
Ty Lackey. 

Stanford responded with two

On Sept. 16 UCSD lost to the top-
ranked California team, UC Berkeley, 
after beating No. 12 UC Irvine in 
the Northern California Tournament. 
hosted by Stanford University. The 
Tritons managed to put together a 
good run after falling behind 7-2 
against the Bears at halftime. After 
cutting the deficit to two after the 
third period, UCSD could not close 
the gap and UC Berkeley held on to 
win 12-8. 

Despite the loss to Cal. the Tritons 
never relented in their efforts to over· 
come the formidable Golden Bear 
squad. 

"They had the chance to blow us 
out, but we just came back," Randall 
said. "We even beat them 4-1 in the 
third quarter.' 

. The earlier game against UC 
Irvine was a nail-biter as the Anteaters 
scored a tying goal with just a cou-
ple of minutes left in the game. But 
Kotanjian and redshirt freshman 2-
meter defense Steven Donohoe each 
scored in overtime for the Triton's 
victory. 

"Our goal is to win the conference 
championship;' Randall said. "We've 
already played some of our confer-
ence rivals and played well. so I'm 
confident.' 

The good start to the season for 
the new team has been somewhat of 
a surprise. but the players hope to get 
better at working as a unit as the sea-
son progresses. Randall said. 

The Tritons will continue their 
season on home turf this week against 
Loyola Marymount University on 
Sept. 22.

After the Warriors tied the match with

senior forward Mark Moreira wasted little

"We have not been finishing goals early in 
the season," Horne said . "However, we were 
able to come out and execute and finish the 
chances we were given." 

One key factor in the 
outcome may have been the quality of the 
goalkeeping, as Salazar turned away four shots, 
while Wildcat keeper Brian Linne could only 
defend one of two Triton strikes.

our feet, and it wa affecting our 
passes:' 

"Once we came back from half-
time and got our first shot on goal, 
it really boosted our confidence." 
Belak-Berger said. "We proved to 
them who was the better team from 
that point forward." 

Malley's goal did indeed give 
the Tritons a surge of momentum 
in scoring as Sepulved a scored an 
unassisted goal just one minute after 
to give UCSD a 2·0 lead. 

Freshman midfielder Alexia 
Zatarain was th ri lled with her first 
collegiate goal in the 54 th minute of 
the game on the first of three corner 
kicks in the match. 

"I was screaming and jumping 
up and down and ran over to all the 
girls for high fives; Zatarain said. "It 
really motivated me to play even bet-
ter and work harder to be a big part 
of the team." 

Belak-Berger earned her first goal 
of the season on a corner kick in the 
79th minute of the game on a pass by 
Campbell, bringing UCSD to 4-0. 

Less th an 10 minutes later, 
Campbell decided she wanted to fin -
ish one off by herself and netted a 
corner kick goal of her own, for the 
final point in the game. 

In addition to the the very suc-
cessfu l offensive play, the Triton 
goalkeepers also played a significant 
role in ensuring victory. Sophomore 
Jessica McGove rn played nearly 
a fuJI game with two saves faCing 
eight shots from the Warriors. while 
sophomore Mia Shirley finished out 
the fU1al 14 minutes to preserve the 
shutout.

Men's Soccer Cruises with Clutch Play Women's 
Volleyball 

Runs Through 
Preseason 

Tritons show stamina 
with three double-OT 
wins in five games 
against formidable 
league adversaries. 

By Brent Westcott 
STAFF WRITER 

The UCSD men's soccer team 
looked to score the biggest win of 
its early season against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills on Sept. 12 at 
Triton Soccer Stadium. 

The Tritons entered the match 
with an overall record of 2- 1-1, 
and a California Collegiate Athletic 
Ass dation record of 1-0- 1. They 
trailed only the Toros, who entered 
the match with an overall record 
of 6-0-0, 2-0-0 in CCAA play, and 
carne in ranked No. IS nationaUy 
among Division II schools. 

However, the Tritons proved to 
be undaunted and wer'e able to pull 
out a 1-0 win in a double overtime 
thril le r that ended with a freshman 
delivering the golden goal. 

Freshman midfielder Tony Choi 
bur ied a shot in the back of the 
net four minutes into the second 
overtime, ensuring the Triton vic-
tory. Choi made an aggressive play 
on junior midfielder Tom Winkler's 
deflec ted corner kick and delivered 
a rocket that sailed past the goal-
keeper. 

Senior defensemen Dustin 
Tannenhaus 3.'ld Matt Horne led a 
tenacious defense that frustrated the 
Toros the entire match. Tannenhaus 
described the Triton's 4-5-1 defen-
sive formation that kept the Toros 
off the scoreboard. 

"The 4-5-1 allows us to keep 10 
men behind the ball and plug up 
passing lanes against an aggressive 
offense like Dominguez Hills:' he 
said. 

Despite the solid defensive out-
ing, Cal State Dominguez Hills was 
able to muster 19 shots, four of 
which were saved by sophomore 
goalkeeper Luis Salazar. Salazar 
credited his team's concentration as 
one of the deciding factors . 

" [The Toros) were undefeated 
and one of our fiercest rivals," Salazar 
said. "The entire team knew that if 
we were going to hand them their 
first loss, we had to stay focused." 

Tannenhaus believed the win 
would give the Tritons a boost head-
ing into the rest of conference play. 
"This win gives our guys tons of 
confidence for the future after a 
mediocre start to the season," he 
said. 

The Tritons looked to use their 
newfound momentum as they went 
on the road to take on Cal State 
Stanislaus in Turlock, Calif. on Sept. . 
16. Unlike their previous match, 
the Tritons had no problem scor-
ing goals, receiving an early score 
from sophomore Tom Caplan, who 
headed in a crossing pass from Choi 
at the I minute, 57 second mark to ARASH

Sports are predicated on those 
expectations: which teams fall short 
and which exceed them. 

Charles Dickens wrote a novel 
about them. Preseason polls depict 
them. Sports analysts get paid to 
hypothesize about them. 

After a 19-8 year, a final national 
rank of 18th and wnference rank of 
fifth, the UCSD women's volleyball 
team, with six returning starters, has 
high expectations for its 2006 season. 

"We're expecting more poise, con-
fidence and quicker changes," head 
coach Tom Black said. "With the fifth 
year seniors, thert:'s a lot of hunger on 
the floor because they really want it." 

Junior captain and senior middle 
blocker Brianna Koche echoed her 
coach's sentiments. 

"We're expecting to win and take 
care of what we need to do," Koche 
said. "Our goal is a national champi-
onship and just continuing to build 
on the success we've had so far." 

The No. II Tritons have already 
notched a 9-2 overall record and are 
well on their way to holding up to the 
expectations. 

The team has recorded victories 
over Cal Poly Pomona, Cal State 
Stanislaus, Cal State Bakersfield 

The deciding goal may have been 
the highlight of the match, but it 
wa a strong defensive outing that 
earned the Tritons victory. [ MEN'S SOCCER, page 39 )

Women's Soccer Suffers First Loss

a laughable 5-0 contest that featured a second-half flurry in which five different Tritons notched goals. 

Nicky Buchanan 
ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR 

The afternoon of Sept. 17 at 
Chico State was a sad reminder 
that all good things ust come 
to an end as the UCSD women's 
soccer team's four-game winning 
st reak was cut short by a 0-1 loss to 
the Wildcats. 

"We created more opportunities 
for shots throughout the game, but 
they had a really good cross that 
rebounded off of one of our play-
ers and went in," senior mid fielder 
HeathH Sugg said. 

Following the first and only goal 
of the game, which came early in 
the 34th minute of the fllst quarter, 
the Tritons kept their pride alive. 

"We stayed pretty composed 
aftetwards, mainly because we 

know we are typically a second-
half team, but the luck just wasn't 
on our side," Sugg said. 

The Tritons maintained the 
upper hand on shooting by a 12-7 
margin, but couldn't pull through 
for goals. 

"Their keeper had some great 
saves, and yeah, we had our first 
loss, but we are going to keep on 
striving to be the team that other 
teams want to beat," Sugg said. 

Despite the end to their win-
ning streak, the work done in pre-
vious weeks is not forgotten. 

A glimpse from Sept. 15, when 
the lady Tritons shut out Cal State 
Stanislaus 5-0 for their fourth win 
on the season, demo.nstrates their 
preceeding glory. 

Junior forward Kathy Sepulveda

Stanislaus opponent, clearing it 
upfield, to be picked up by a fellow 
Triton, junior mid fielder Chelsea 
Campbell. Campbell shoots, misses 
and the ball is saved by the Warrior 
goalkeeper, but not for long, as 
senior forward Alise Malley pounds 
in a follow-up shot to net the first 
goal of the game just 28 seconds 
into the second half. 

Despite a very uneventful first 
half, with no scoring by either 
team, UCSD came back pumped 
after halftime to redeem itself of 
the 10 shots the team missed in the 
first to come away with the win. 

"We just needed to settle down," 
sophomore forward Natasha Belak-
Berger said. ·We were panicking 
in our minds instead of following

Men's Water Polo Takes Fifth 
Place at NorCal Tournament 

By Paul Choi 
STAFF WRITER 

Coming off a 24-8 season last 
year, the be. in school history, this 
year's UCSD men's water polo team 
looked just as impressive, winning 
the first 11 of 13 games. 

"We had a stacked team last year," 
senior goalkeeper Jeremy Randall 
said. "We have a huge learning curve 
this year because we have many new 
players. We have to learn how to play 
together:' 

While last year's team was full of 
accolades and victories, it fell short of 
making the NCAA final four by losing 
to Loyola Marymount University in 
the Western Water Polo Association 
Championship. The Triton players 
and coaches seek to go further this 
season and into the NCAA tourna-
ment. 

"I'm kind of surprised how well 
we're playing together for having 
three new starters; said junior driver 
Nestor Dordoni, one of a few trans-
fer students on the team. "I feel like 
we're going to keep getting better and 
I'm confident in winning the confer-

ence." 
In the first two tournaments of 

the season, UCSD took care of busi-
ness, cruising to wins in the lnland 
Empire Tournament and the Triton 
Invitational. 

In the Triton Invitational 
Tournament on Sept. 2-3, UCSD took 
care of business against UC Santa 
Cruz, 10-4, and UC Santa Barbara, 
9-7. They went on to beat No. 14 UC 
Davis, 13-9, in the semifmals to face 
the No. 6 Pepperdine University, in a 
thriller for the championship. 

The Waves went up 4-0 early in 
the first quarter, it took the Tritons 
almost two quarters to chip away 
at the lead to tie it at 5-5, but in the 
last minute of the half, Pepperdine 
University managed to take the lead 
by one. 

After trading goals in the third 
period, the Waves took a one-point 
lead in the fourth quarter. UCSD 
couldn't get any offense going until 
junior utility A.J. Kotanjian scored 
the tying goal with only 58 seconds 
remaining in the game to force over-
