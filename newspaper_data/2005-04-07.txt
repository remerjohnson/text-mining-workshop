RIAA issues subpoena 
• warnings to campus 

ResNet must report violations, 
though policy prevents searches 

By SHANNON EUor 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD students engaging in 
illegal file sharing may lose their 
Internet privileges as a result of 
subpoena warnings received by the 
campus residential network. Such 
warnings by the Recording Industry 
Association of America alen cam-
pus administrators that the RIAA 
will be sending a subpoena in the 
near future requesting the personal 
information of students suspected 
of sharing copyrighted material. 

The university has received 

approximately 50 of these notic-
es since January, according to 
Academic Computing Services 
Director Tony Wood. 

The counesy notices request 
that the university make affected 
individuals aware that they have 
a legal obligation to preserve evi-
dence that relates to RIAA legal 
claims. At a minimum, the indi-
viduals must preserve the entire 
library of recordings made avail-
able for distribution as well as any 
downloaded recordings. While

In a press release, the council

Ranks of uninsured to 
grow, study predicts 

More than one out of every four 
workers under 65, or nearly 56 mil-
lion people, will lack health insur-
ance by 2013, new projections by 
UCSD School of Medicine estimate. 
The projection blames rising costs of 
health insurance as one of the pri· 
mary causes for the increase. 

The study looked at measures like 
health spending. personal spending 
and other population characteristics. 

"Regardless of whether health care 
benefits are being paid out of the 
employer's or employee's pocket, and 
without regard to the amount of pre-
mium contribution that employees are 
required to make, there is a remarilably 
tight relationship between affordability 
and coverage rates: the study states. 

The researchers concluded that 
the current system of employer-spon-
sored healthcare or any altemate uni-
versal coverage proposal would be 
unsustainable without efforts to cut 
the rising cost of health services. 

EdFund extends loan 
fee waiver 

The California Student Aid 
Commission and its loan selVices aux-
iliary EdFund announced last month 
that they would continue to waive the 
1-percent loan guarantee fee through 
September 2006. 

Under federal law, guarantee agen-
cies are authorized to charge the fees 
to offset costs incurred by borrowers 
who default on loans. EdFund, one of 
the biggest guarantee agencies in the 
country, first began waiVIng the fee in 
1996. In recent years, other agencies 
in the industry have eliminated or 
significantiv reduced their own fees 
to gain a larger share in the college 
student loan market. 

EdFund also guarantees all fed-
eral student loans taken out by UCSD 
students, meaning that the extension 

••• 

of the fee waiver could translate into 
savings for students that total in the 
tens of thousands of dollars. 

"In this time of increasing college 
costs, we are pleased to prOliide this 
financial benefit to students and their 
families: CSAC Executive Director 
Diana Fuentes-Michei stated in a press 
release. "The commission and EdFund 
are continuing their strong commitment 
to increasing access to higher education 
in e-/ery way possible~ 

As part of its scheduled reautho-
rization of the Higher Education kt 
Congress may make changes to federal 
student loan programs later this year. 

Last year, President George w. 
Bush proposed making the guaran-
tee fee mandatory, responding to 
concems of smaller guarantee agen-
cies who said they could not afford 
to compete with larger companies 
offering fee discounts and, as a result, 
saw their business fall to the point 
that they could no longer meet legal 
reselVe requirements. 

Scientists link enzymes, 
biological clock 

A gene mutation, and the enzyme 
it creates, may be responsible for 
acc.elerating the biological clock in 
some people, causing them to go to 
bed and wake up hours earlier than 
normal, UC San Francisco scientists 
have reported in a study. 

In fact, genes may provide new 
insight about regulatory processes of 
the body's internal clock, or circadian 
rhythms. These rhythms, characterized 
by a waxing and waning of genetic, 
biochemical and physiological pro-
cesses that occur in a 24-hour period, 
have so far proven to be a mystery to 
researchers at the molecular level. 

The UCSF study looked at the 
mutation of the same gene in sev-
eral species of organisms, including 
humans, mice and flies. It suggests 
that gene mutation may playa role in 
shaping the circadian cycles. 

Regents sign on to 
Supreme Court brief 

The UC Board of Regents, among 
other higher education institutions, 
has signed onto a brief in a Supreme 
Court case that examines a specific 
exception in patent law. 

The case deals with a so-called 
·safe harbor" provision in the fed-
eral Patent Act that allows the U5e of 
patented materials in the course of 
certain drug research. The regents, 
along with the American Council on 
Education, are backing a narrON inter-
pretation of the exception, arguing 
that a broad application would threat-
en academic research.

A.S. ELECTIONS 2005 

ERe disqualification upheld 
J-board rules against Dynamite slate 

By VLADIMIR KOGAN 
News Editor 

The Eleanor Roosevelt 
College Judicial Board voted 
unanimously on April 4 to uphold 
the disqualification of the col-
lege's Dynamite slate, effectively 
taking the five-person party out 
of the race. 

In its decision, the board 
refused to overturn the Roosevelt 
Elections Committee's decision 
that Dynamite had violated the 
college'S election bylaws by failing 
to comply with specific provisions 
for slates accepting voluntary 
spending limits. 

Under the college's regula -
tions, candidates must present 
receipts or market-value esti-
mates of campaign materials to 
the elections manager prior to 
their use . 

The committee ruled that 
Dynamite had not secured 
approval for all of its materials 
before employing them in the 
campaign. 

"They di squalified us for 
this one banner, and I think it's 
really unfair," said Roger Chin, 
Dynamite 's candidate for the 
college's student council chair-
manship. "Voting had already 
started, and then they pull this 
crap." 

Chin said the slate was con-
sidering filing its own grievance 
against the Roosevelt Elections 
Committee, accusing it of target-
ing the Dynamite slate and acting 
with bias in the consideration of 
the grievances. 

"Through this whole pro-
cess, we were very angry with 
the elections committee," Chin 
said. "We feel that they walked 
around trying to find things to 
fault us on." 

However, Elections 
Committee Chair Pro-temp 
Arielle Maccio said the college's 
bvlaws were clear, as were the 
consequences for violating them, 
leaving the committee with little 
discretion in ruling on guilt and 
punishment. 

"We made every effort to main-
tain Roosevelt Dynamite's can-
didacy in this election," Maccio 
said. "We feel, as a committee, 
that we were very unbiased in this 
decision." 

Though Chin suggested that 
the slate could have been given 
a warning, Roosevelt Elections 
Manager James Liu said the 
bylaws clearly defined automatic 
disqualification as the penalty 
for violating spending limit reg-
ulations, tying the committee's 
hands in deciding on a lesser 
punishment. 

"In this case, we didn't have 
that leniency," he said. 

The slate was notified of the 
grievance after 2:30 a.m. on April 
2 and was told to attend a hearing 
on the matter shortly before noon 
of the same day, giving it little 
opportunity to prepare a defense, 
Chin said. However, Maccio 
said the bylaws, which require 
the elections committee to hold a 
grievance hearing within 24 hours 
of thc filing, were to blame for the 
short notice. 

INTERESTED .IN 

In addition, Chin said the 
credibility of both the elections 
committee and the judicial board 
- both appointed by the current 
student council - was overshad-
owed by a conflict of interest. 
Since the opposing Onka slate 
dominates the current council, 
political appointees served essen-
tially as the lawyers, judges and 
juries on the case, he said. 

lbough the council appoint-
ed them, Judicial Board Chair 
Marissa Saatchi said all members 
acted impartially. 

"I think it's important for 
everyone to know that the judicial 
board was very unbiased," Saatchi 
said. "Our job is to make the stu-
dents feel like they can come to 
us and [have us) give them a fair 
Dial. And that's what happened in 
this case." 

Late on April 2, the board 
issued a preliminary restraining 
order allowing Dynamite to keep 
its posters up and continue cam-
paigning, to make sure the slate 
was not disadvantaged in case the 
election committee's ruling was 
overturned, according to Saatchi. 

Because of the timing of the 
disqualification, all five Dynamite 
candidates will appear on the 
ballot. However, any votes cast 
for them will not be counted in 
assessing the winner of the races, 
according to Liu. 

"We're hoping that people vote 
for us so that we can see what kind 
of support we have," Chin said.

Debt burden growing, 
government reports 
Students taking out more 

loans to pay for educatiom 
By CHRISTIANA VAlDA 

Daily Collegian (Pennsylvania State U.) 

(U-WIRE) UNIVERSITY 
PARK., Pa. - After he pays his 
rent this month , Pennsylvania 
State University freshman Jason 
Nowacinski will have $7 left in his 
savings account. 

Nowacinski, a history major, 
lives off campus and has been 
working at Say Sushi four nights a 
week since the beginning of spring 
semester. He gets paid about $8 an 
hour, and sometimes $12 to $16 on 
busy nights . 

But Nowacinski still finds it 
hard to meet his expenses and will 
need to take out a stutlent loan 
next year to meet tuition , room and 
board costs. 

"It's harder to get through school 
if you're working - especially four 
nights a week - but it's something 
you have to do, " he said. 

A new study released by the U.S. 
Department of Education suggests 
that increasing tuition, higher bor-
rowing limits of government loans 
and a new wave of low-income Stu-
dents have increased the average debt 
burden fot undergraduate students. 

The study was based on govern-
ment figures and a nationally rep-
resentative survey of students who 
received bachelor 's degrees. T he 
study ci tes an "immediate and dra-
matic" rise in the number of students 
borrowing money in the 199Os. 

On average, undergraduate stu-

dents borrow $19,300, an increase 
from $12,100 a decade ago. 

The study also indicated that stu-
dents from all income groups are tak-
ing on debt to go to college. In 2000, 
46 percent from the top income 
tier reported borrowing money, an 
increase from 24 percent in 1992-19 
93, according to the survey. 

The study also showed that stu-
dents from lower-income families 
have taken on a greater loan bur-
den - 72 percent took out loans 
in 1999-2000, an increase from 67 
percent in 1992-93 . 

"For some people, having to work 
while in school may not be a bad 
thing if you can manage your time 
well ," Pennsylvania State professor 
and consumer issues specialist Cathy 
Bowen said. "It also takes a level of 
responsibility - if you're working 
to payoff that loan, you realize the 
value of that education." 

Pennsylvania State senior 
Kiersten Walker is on a scholarship 
that covers tuition and room and 
board, but she has friends who have 
to work to meet all those costs. 

"Taking out a student loan is 
twice as hard for students, because 
you're working to stay in school," 
she said. 

Bowen said students should look 
into their options before taking out 
a student loan. 

"Each situation is different," said 
Robert Snyder, administrative servic-
es director at the university'S Office of

J.-boards must keep 
election meetings open 
T he Eleanor Roosevelt Colle~e Judicial Board s decision to 
keep the trial closed in the 
case of disqualified ERC 
slate Dynamite was inap-
propriate and represents a 
lack of democratic proce-
dure. 

Although campus 
judicial boards usu-
ally have good reason to 
close meetIngs and trials, 
namely to protect the stu-
dents involved, this rule 
shouldn't apply in all cases. 
Disputes over on-cam-
pus drinking or conflicts 
between students deserve 
the utmost privacy for the 
parties involved; debates 
over college elections, 
however, are more than 
fair game ro the public. 
TheERC Judicial Board 
and the Dynamite slate 
should not have deter-
mined the slate's candidacy 
in a closed meeting. 

More importantly, every. 
judicial board on campus 
should enact public policy 

stating that election mat-
ters should be open. It's 
one thing that the mem-
bers of the ERC Judicial 
Board are not elected by 
the students, but the fact 
that these political appoin-
tees are ruling on elec-
tions behind dosed doors 
is unacceptable and sends 
the wrong message to vot-
ers. 

Since an incident like 
this on the A.S . level 
would be made public in 
the Elections Committee, 
processes in the individual 
Judicial Boards should be 
open to students as well. 
The administratjon and 
student politicians com-
plain about student apathy, 
but what can they expect 
when these very voters are 
purposefully distanced and 
closed out? It's hypocriti -
cal to demand students to 
take these elections seri-
ously and to vote when 
judicial boards are mak-
ing the entire process less 
democra tic. 

Closed.-meeting bylaws 
must be more specific 

T he Student-Run Television porn fiasco has helped throw light 
on a grave weakness in the 
rules governing the opera-
tions of Associated Students: 
There exist no protections 
for public access and no 
guarantee of openness and 
transparency in the A.S. 
Council and its appendages. 

New bylaw changes spon-
sored by John Mwr College 

enior ?enator Neil Spe~rs 
to reqUIre a super-majority 
vote to close meetings of 
the A.S . Senate to the public 
are a good step. However, 
to truly protect the rights 
of students whose fees pay 
the sa laries of elected lead-
ers, the council must go 
further with a policy dlat 
requjres all of its commit-
tee to meet publicly. Such 
policy must oe included in 
ASUCSD's constitution, 
not committee bylaws that 
can be waived by a simple 
vote of the senators. 

California's stringent 
open-meeting laws already 

provide very specific statu-
tory exclUSIOns to protect 
inforn:-ation covered by 
attorney-client privilege, 
collective bargaining and 
other special circumstances. 
The council's own policies 
must be similarly specific, 
outlining its commitment 
to responsive governance 
limited only to clearly enu-
merated exceptions. 

If council members truly 
have a vision of transform-
ing Associated Students 
into an autonomous body, 
they must act like one, and 
comply with regulations 
governing such institutions. 
Alternatively, they can shirk 
their public responsibility 
and wait for the regents or 
Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph W. Watson 
to impose open-meeting 
mandates on them. 

In this election, the coun-
cil has asked us to entrust 
it with $9 of activity fees. 
Now, councilmembers must 
prove themselves worthy of 
such trust.

Mt. Soledad cross controversy 
• • • • represents minority winning out 

By ROBIN AVERBECK 
Staff Writer 

D emocracy - it sounds like a simple formula, does it not? We are given relatively clear and hopeful explanations for it in our younger 
years - democracy is rule by the people. The people 
vote, the people get what they want. Yet, the people 
also have freedoms, certain rights, that even major-
ity votes can't override. Vb oh. It's starting to get a 
bit more complicated. The essential dilemma in any 
liberal society - minority rights versus majority rule 

" 

cross doesn't hassle them about converting, the cross 
doesn't take away their benefits in their government 
job. Yet they feel like it is an undue weight on their 
comfort to have to live among the symbols of a highly 
religious culrure, no matter what comfort and mean-
ing, however harmless, that symbol brings to so many 
people. Ultimately, their personal feeling of belonging 
and acceptance in society is more important than the 
democratic expression of a veteran's group. This is not 
minority rights - this is minority megalomania. 

The crux of the matter is that despite popular 
belief, society is not obligated to make you feel 

- has reared its ugly head in our 
area recently, in more ways than one. 
The over-exaggeration of minority 
rights has run rampant; the tendency 
to demand that society conform to 
our comfort levels is out of control. 
The Mt. Soledad cross debate is 
by far the most clear and potent 
illustration of this trend . In a time 
of heightened cui rural tensions, the 
controversy is just one in a litany 
of deba tes over the line between 

society is not 
obligated to make 

you feel 
comfortable. " 

comfortable. Our constirution, and 
our democratic society, is obligated 
to offer freedom of speech, religion, 
and equal rights and opportunities. 
However, if you truly implement this, 
the inevitable consequence will be a 
lot of speech and expression, com-
ing from both majority and minority 
sources, that you find apprehensible 
but must nevertheless accept as a 
consequence of living in a liberal 
society. Hence the irony of srudents 

majority culrure and minority rights. However, with 
this case and many others, the argument for minor-
ity rights has been greatly exaggerated. For example, 
the courts and others who wish the cross to be taken 
down argue that it violates the separation of church 
and state; if we consider the presence of the cross 
on public property as an endorsement of religion 
by the state, that logic has its merits. However, it is 
ridicu l o~s that anyone would have gone through the 
trouble to argue this unproven and debatable tech-
nicality - why would someone be so offended as to 
bother tearing down the cross, anyway? 

The answer is simple: Some people don't like it. It 
offends their ever-so-conscious sensibilities. It is no 
matter that the cross does them no hann by simply 
sitting there. The cross doesn't witness to them, the 

who call themselves liberals calling for the Koala 's 
dismantling. This faulty idea was especially pro-
nounced in the reaction to the pornography aired on 
SRTV in February, which can be easily summari zed 
as ridiculous. Many students, mostly from the more 
politically active realm, used the porn incident as 
an opportunity to complain about feeling a hosti le 
environment on campus, tinted with racism and 
white male privilege. To connect editor Steve York's 
romp one evening to white male privilege is such 
a stretch that it's almost impressive as a work of 
imagi nation. Even if there were such a connection, 
that is no grounds on which to strip the ,KoaJa of its 
show. Society makes people feel uncomfortable all

Srudents or any other entity to 
"make it better" is egotistical and 
inconsistent with the principles of 
a society that aspires to truly have

concern can also be addressed in

It is understand-

not to demand that

ocratic action: individually, simply 
by setting an example . Perhaps a 
good way to not give in to white 
male privilege, for example, is to 
refuse to engage in exploitative 
behavior that springs from it. In 
this manner, one can maintain 
integrity without demanding that 
everyone else conduct themselves 
in the same manner, a demand 
that no one has the right to make. 
Secondly, as we are in a democ-
racy, we can form civil organiza-
tions and groups to exercise our 
freedom of association and speech 
to promote our views. However, 

because a minority 
for some reason insisted on inter-
preting it as a personal affront to its 
own religion or lack thereof. 

Simply, we all need (Q suck it up. 
Political correctness has expanded 
to such a scope that people are 
making claims where no grounds 
exist and demanding territory that 
ought to belong, unquestioned, to 
the timelessly important principles 
of freedom of speech, expression 
and religious practice. U ltimately, 
this society is not made out of com-
munities but small units of individu-
als, and to take a freedom from one 
individual today is to take another 
from yourself in the furure.

Exciting athletic 

programs do exist 
Dear Editor: 

Your March 28 opinion piece 
on UCSD sports ("D-I sports 
not right for UCSD," March 28) 
carried the ring of uuth, but it was 
still a bit of a clunker. You said, 
"It's easy to point at UCSD's lack 
of an exciting athletics program 
as the reason UCSD supposedly 
lacks school spirit or has a low 
alumni donation rate." 

Well , there are exciting athletic 
programs at UCSD. And they're 
not just NCAA sports, either. 
Did you know, for example, that 
the Triton women's rugby team, 
which hasn't lost in league play 
since 2002, is headed for its fourth 
consecutive berth at Nationals? 

The GUllrdian itself contrib-
utes to the dearth of excitement 
over Triton athletics. Your cal-
endar section advertises NCAA 
sports, but eschews mention of 
club sports like rugby, water polo, 
lacrosse and the like. Few stories 
are written of club sports, either, 
despite spoon feeding sports 
reporters wi th press releases.

I have never represented myself

the author of the article that [ do 
not consider myself an expert on 
UCSD programming. I did not 
get any sponsorships while serving

6 OPINION T HE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY. A PRIL 7. 2005 

Pope's death illuminates role of religion in today's society 
John Paul II was all right - but how about an educated, secular, female 'Pope'! 

Lines in 
the sand 

Ian s. Port 

Even for those of us who are as nonreligious as people can get, the death of the pope is 
an event at which to take pause. 
There's something comforting 
about the way he looks in the 1V 
footage - immersed in a crying, 
reaching, joyous crowd, or reach-
ing out to pat the heads of wide-
eyed infants - that appeals to all, 
I think because he appears humble, 
or as dose to humble as the leader 
of a billion people can get. (plus, of 
course, he 's a cute old man.) T hose 
are the moments when you want 
to overlook his traditional ideas 
and allow yourself to think of him 
as a Good Man, deserving of the 
Sainthood that he will no doubt 
receive. 

But whether or not the con-
tribution of Karol Wojtyla (a.k.a . 
John Paul II) was a truly positive 
one, his work reflects a larger truth 
about humanity: Even as the evo-

lution of technology ever isolates 
us, and our vastly differi ng experi-
ences alienate us from one another, 
even as we become more intelligent 
about the way our world works and 
divided about how it should be run, 
humans still need to be reached 
on a level beyond that of secular 
culmre. The fact that the leader 
of an institution as archaic, tradi-
tional and stubborn as the Roman 
Catholic Church (and a leader who 
was aU of those things himself) was 
able to accomplish the amount of 
good in the world that he did is 
evidence that the higher aspects 
of human intelligence shouldn't 
be ignored when trying to solve 
human problems. 

Which got me thinking: If it 
is in his most humble 11)0mentS 
that John Paul II was most illustri-
ous, if his greatest accomplishment 
was being a compassionate human 
who let his convictions direct his 
actions, what kind of good could 
a figure who exhibited all of those 
characteristics but none of John 
Paul's religious traditionalism 
accomplish) Is it even possible for a 
single. nonreligious, rational figure 
to ever appeal to so many people 
and accomplish as much geopoliti-

cal good as the pope did? 
Let's assume that it is and let 

ourselves dream for a few min-
utes about what our current world 

" Is it even possible for a 
single , nonreUgious , 

rational figure to ever 
appeal to so many people 
and accomplish as much 
geopoUtical good as the 

Pope did?" 
might look like to such a figure. 
If there were a woman of similar 
influence as the pope, whose only 
allegiance was to human progress, 
where would she stand on the issues 
that occupy our attention? 

Doubtless Paula Perfect I would 
turn a quick eye to that suppos-
edly pious state of Florida, where 
fundamenta list fervor recently led 
to controversy over the fate of 

Eledion Campaign Period 

T erri Schiavo . In the wake of an 
. incredibly fie rce national debate o n 

a frighteningly divisive issue, our 
Peace Pope would take an audi-
ence with Shiavo's family, remind-
ing them gently that dea th is only 
a part of life and perhaps that their 
daughter is better off now, free from 
the tubes of plastic through which 
she barely hung on to life. Her 
condolences made, P ope Perfect 
woul d then fly to Washington, find 
Tom DeLay, and ask him to make a 
televised apology to the American 
people for being such a scheming 
asshole. 

After that, if DeLay indeed 
learned his lesson, Our Woman 
would buy the corpulent congress-
man a beer and ask him what hap-
pened (''Jesus, man, wh at were you 
thi nking?"). 

But Washington would be an 
intense place for the Ambassador 
of Goodness; how could he remain 
there too long withou t fee ling the 
need to say something else about 
the scary state of America? She 
couldn't. So, a bit sauced after 
her afternoon with 01' DeLay, 
Paula would seek audience (and a 
sure-to-be-good-ass dinner) with 
another powerful Texan . Even the

(Asked later by one of the scores

Transfer housing to be delayed 
University short of bonds to pay for project Feeding the fight 

By NAYEL! PACiAZA 
Contributing Writer 

UCSD transfer students will 
continue to look for housing off-
campus until January 2006 as a 
result of construction delays in the 
North Campus housing project 
caused by a UC-wide debt cap. 

Credit rating agencies, financial 
advisers and the UC Office of the 
President determined $600 million 
in bond money is available to split 
among all UC campuses in 2005. 

UCSD would receive more 
than 10 percent, or $65 million . 

evertheless, campus Director 
of Resource Planning Brian 
Gregory said this would not be 
enough to build the planned $110 
million housing project targeted 
to house 1,000 transfer and upper-
division smdents. 

"This is a very important 
project for us because unlike UC 
Berkeley or UCLA, UCSD has 
room to add more smdents and 
we want to prioritize this issue," 
Gregory said. 

He said that UC President 
RobertC. Dynes is working with the 
bond counsel to determine whether 
planning of the facility could begin 
next January instead of this year, as 
was originally scheduled. 

The university is working with 
the governor's office and the state 
Legislature to place a referendum 
on the November 2006 election bal-
lot asking Californians to approve 
the sale of general obligation bonds 
for the university'S capital projects. 
If the bond mea ure passes, design-
ing of the housing project could 
begin January 2006 and construc-
tion would finish by January 2009. 

However, A.S. Pre ident Jenn 
Pae said she believes not enough 

is being done for transfer students, 
who make up roughly 25 percent 
of the estimated 22 ,000 under-
graduate students at UCSD . 

"Although the housing facility 
has to be funded in the beginning, 
the building will pay for itself 
because it's a self-sustaining proj-
ect," Pae said. 

She said the project has been 
"consistently delayed and is not 
being prioritized.· 

Instead of the housing project, 
the university has approved using 
the $65 million in UCOP money 

" It's been proven the 
transfer students are 

not being accomodated 
for .. . They are not as 
happy as other students." 

- Jenn Pae, U president 

to fund the expansion of the cam-
pus' Cardiovascular Center and 
Thornton Hospital project. Though 
the expansion also has a price tag of 
about $100 million, $30 million 
of the total has been raised in pri-
vate gifts and additional money will 
come from hospital reserves. 

The news of the housing proj-
ect's delay has disappointed con-
tinuing transfer students, who said 
they feel their transition to UCSD 
could have been easier if they had 
tlle option of living on campus. 
Now, new transfers will also have to 
wait to live on campus.

facility," said Thurgood Marshall 
College junior Marisol Bonilla, 
who transferred from Grossmont 
Community College last fall. 

Although its a lot cheaper for 
Bonilla to live off campus with her 
parents, she said living on campus 
would be more practical because 
her commute is approximately twO 
hours every day. 

Bonilla said it would have 
been a good way to connect with 
UCSD srudents and the campus' 
resources by getting the "ful l col-
lege experience." She would have 
been satisfied with only one quar-
ter of guaranteed housing. 

"It's been proven that transfer 
students are not being accommo-
dated for," Pae said. "There is not 
a place for them to come together 
and enjoy what UCSD has to offer. 
They are not as happy as other stu-
dents who come freshman year." 

Earl Warren Coll ege junior 
and transfer student Chris Terry 
said he had a rough time adjust-
ing to living off campus, because 
transfer srudentS are used to going 
home after class ends. 

He lived with his parents his first 
year at the campus, which made for 
a 20-minute commute. However, 
Terry said he would have lived on 
campus if given the opportunity. 

This year, few of the 8,300 
students who live on campus

affected individuals must preserve 
their recordings, they are allowed 
to disable or uninstall any file-shar-
ing software should they choose to 
do so. 

"So far we have received no [actu-
al) subpoenas related to file sharing," 
Wood stated in an e-mail. "We have 
received a 'courtesy notice' from an 
attorney working for the RIM that 
says they are about to issue a sub-
poena, and [ believe we will have no 
choice but to provide the requested 
infonnation." 

As . stated In the UCSD 
Electronic Communications 
Policy, ResNet possesses records of 
all Digital Millennium Copyright 
Act complaints alleging copyright 
infringements. The "Unavoidable 
Inspection" cla use 

" 

offenders can be as high as five 
years in prison and $250;000 in 
fines. Civil penalties can run into 
thousands of dollars in damages and 
legal fees, with a minimum penalty 
of$750 per song. 

UCSD is not the only school 
being issued admonishments. Since 
September 2003, the RlAA, on behalf 
of the major record companies, has 
filed approximately 9,900 copyright 
infringement lawsui ts against illegal 
file sharers, including individual net-
work users at colleges and universi-
ties all across the country. 

While the association declined 
to comment on specific pending 
litigation, it said it was trying to 
address the problems presented 
by file sharing on univer ity cam-
puses. 

"The most important way to 
beat piracy is to 
offer a compel-
ling legal alterna-

of the policy sta tes 
that "systems per-
sonnel shall not 
intentionally search 
electronic commu-
nications records 
or transactional 
information for 
violations of law or

resources. While officials do not 
intentionally search for evidence of 
wrongdoing on the part of students, 
they are allowed to report inadver-
tently discovered violations. 

In a letter to students registered 
on the campus network, ResNet 
told users to avoid potentially seri-
ous consequences of sharing copy-
righted material by uninstalling 
file-sharing software. 

"Once we contact a student 
regarding one of these notices, there 
is genuine concern," ACS Network 
Services Mamger Erik Strahm said. 
"[However), I can tell you that 
the amount of bandwidth used for 
file sharing has not changed [since 
receiving the notices J. " 

Eleanor Roosevelt College 
sophomore Ernest Hsu said that 
students he knew were taking the 
warning seriously. 

~I think it is a big deal and 
people are, for the most part, wor-
ried," Hsu said . "But it's kind of 
situational. Piraters will always be 
gung-ho until they get caught; then 
we become conservative, then more 
gung-ho. It's a cycle."

T he association said it believes 
that it is making progres not only 
in catching copyright violators, 
but turning potential sharers away 
from illegal Internet distribution 
and downloading. 

"We are pleased with the great 
progress made by the higher edu-
cation community in recent years 
to address piracy on our cam-
puses," the e-mail stated . "For 
example, the Joint Committee 
of the Higher Education and 
Entertainment Communities was 
formed two years ago to develop 
collaborative solutions to address 
illegal file sharing at colleges and 
universities. 

More than 40 colleges and uni~ 
versities across the country now 
have partnerships with legal music 
services, and schools are moving 
to get a technological handle on 
bandwidth-clogging file-sharing 
networks. We sti ll have tremen-
dous work to do, but there has 
been significant movement in the 
right direction."

"Our commission has been very

said. "We will not be tracking indi-
vidual students, but rather patterns 
of students. However, we must have 
a unique student identifier to track

Many precautions will be taken 
to ensure that none of the student 
information could be traced back 
to any ihdividual's identity, he said. 
Each student will be assigned a 
unique number that will be used 
in all studies associated with the 
specific student and it would be 
impossible for anyone to determine 
that student's name, according to 

Haberman. 
The objectives of tracking 

include determining how well the 
transfer system works, how long it 
takes students to earn a degree and 
why some students have concurrent 
enrollment in both a community 
college and a UC or CSU campus. 
according to Haberman. 

"Our purpose is to monitor 
the effectiveness and efficiency

__ ..... dian twins Tegan and Sara live 
s, from the placeless folk of their 

(apparendy) self-inflicted haircu 
By ANN SHEN 

Senior Staff Writer 

Poppy, confrontational and addictive at the same time, 24-year-old Canadian folk-rock twins Tegan and Sara - armed with latest record . So J ealous, 
and increasingly infectious live shows - are like 
Quaker IOO-percent Oats, Honey and Raisins for your 
ears. Speaking with member Sara Quin confirms that 
the duo is likely to be named as the "nicest" indie 
group currently out there. 

T he duo first started making music and demos in a 
class at their hometown Calgary high school. They 
later started making wave in the Canadian indepen-
dent scene by earning the highest score in history at 
the University of Calgary's "Garage Wars" competition 
in 1998. The competition garnered the band enough 
attention and friends that they were given a slot in the 
Lilith Fair tour later that year and signed to Vapor 
Records in 2000. 

Although they igned to a major distributor, most of 
the production work is still under Tegan and ara's 
control. They each write their own songs independent-
ly and then send demos through the mail, as Tegan cu.r-
rently lives in Vancouver and Sara lives in Montreal. 

"We've always been each other's producer," Sara 
said. "Once I get songs from Tegan, I'll start to give 
feedback." 

So Jea/ollS, has earned even more mainstream atten-
tion since the band started touring with current 

Facebook favorite the Killers. Wrapped up in a pop 
girl-rock album. So Jealolls sounds like the "collabora-
tion through production and arrangement" it is. 

"[With demos), we made mixed CDs that were 
labeled by 'this is a Sara song. this is a Tegan song,'" 
Sara said. "ft sounded fucked up to me. Tegan was writ-
ing these short power ballad pop songs and I was writ-
ing these weird Peter Gabriel. Genesis song !" 

The title of the record comes from a catchphrase 
that embodied the project in production. 

"In the studio, we would look at magazines and go, 
'God, I'm so jealous of o-and-so's record!'" Sara said. 
"It was a phrase we used all the time. [Later) we talked 
about what its like to be in a band and outside of a 
scene. It's like looking at a group of kids when you're 
hanging out by yourself. You think you're cool and your 
parents think you're cool, but you go out and you're 
lik!, 'Ugh, I'm a fuclci..~.g dork.' [We were] feeling a bi t} 
jS<llated and jealous of other people 's projects. Jealousy 
fuels you to drive you to do what you're doing." 

The group's music, production, merchandising and 
most promotions are handled by the duo itself. . 

"I like to believe that most people who meet us will 
kinda get it," Sara said. "But you meet random promo-
tions people all the time that you are like, 'Oh my God, 
please stop working for us!'" 

They had a brush with outside promotions during 
preparations to release the record in Europe when the 
UK distributors created a Web site for the band. 

"It was so ugly! " Sara said. "I thought J was going to

have a stroke! I was like, 'Oh my God, how do we get 
it down? What am I going to do?' So now when pro-
motions come up I'll say, 'Let me do it! When do you 
need it b},? '" 

Now the band is probably receiving the same reac-
tions on its project - a jea lousy-worthy world tour 
that includes an upcoming date at Coachella. Word has 
been wildly spreading about the funny family storie 
and tremendous energy of the shows, and the band 
feels the vibe. 

"I've never felt more comfortable going live!" Sara 
said. ''We're really tight on stage; we just really enjoy 
the people who come and see us play." 

Their infamous storytelling began in the early 
shows when no one knew what the band was. 

"We told funny stories because we couldn 't over-
power a noisy room sometimes, so we would use our 
skills as storytellers rto create a] verbal connection to 
rthe audience]" Sara said. 

Staying grounded through the whirlwind tour has 
been a major point in keeping the sweet do-it-yourself 
nature of the music. 

"The industry is so into aU the business of it, Ibut) 
the reaHty of it is that people will line up and pay 10, 
15 bucks to see a show, and there is this cool vibe 
between the audience and the band that is really what 
matters," Sara said. "It has nothing to do with how 
many records you've sold that day.~ 

Tegan and Sara will open for the Killers at RIMAC 
Arena on April 12.

THURSDAY, APRIL 7. Zoo5 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS 11 

Graduating MFA students honor 'fatherr! of performance art 
Iy 811M UIGA 
SeniOf Staff Writer 

P asSing~riod commuters in the ni ttnarishly obstructed Revel e-Sun God corridor 
might have noticed a new con-
struction outside the ever-present 
mess of Student Center. 

Tucked neatly in the lobby of 
the University Art Gallery, this 
straw-and-wood hut is festooned 
with quaint signs such as "keep 
out!" or "no, you cannot come 
in!" Is this the new Women's 
Center, or has some hobo built a 
home in the middle of campus? 

No, it's not a new UCSD 
building, it's a Master of Fine Arts 
piece from graduating UCS D 
visual arts student Mark Oliver, 
who built it with his own hands to 
showca e his experiellces in an 
Amish community. Oliver's piece, 
and its odd" juxtaposition with its 
environment, serves as the wel-
come to the University Art 
Gallery's latest exhibition. 

Titled "Now Happening," the 
exhibition celebrates the career of 
professor emeritus Allan Kaprow, 
a man who essentially invented 
performance art in the 19505 with 
his construction of often impro-
vised pieces that emphasized 
the mundane yet beautiful bits 
in life. 

Kaprow called these lifelike 
performance art pieces 
"Happenings," and through his 
efforts he is either to thank or 
to blame for its many practi-
tioners since, from television 
prankster Andy Kaufman to any 
number of satirica l political 
protestors. 

But don't just show up at the 
University An Galle.ry expect-
ing an intergender wrestling 
match or the pie-ing of Bill 
Gates. The nineteen installa-
tions that make up "Now 
Happening" do not involve any 
actors other than the audience. 
Instead, each installation chan-
nels the mood of such avant-
garde performances into sculp-
tures, paintings or video instal-
lations. It's studio art, to be 
sure, but the youth and interest 
of the graduating visual arts 
MFA students make it anything 
but ordinary. 

In addition to more tradi-
tional mediums of paint and 
photograph, "Now 
Happening" also features all 
kinds of interesting takes on 
interactive art to fit the largest 
possible idea in the smallest 
possible space. 

A science-fiction device near 
the front of the gallery houses 
an airtight viewing environ-
ment for Matt Hope's "Perfect 
Cube," a perfectly square block 
too small to see without the aid 
of a monitor. The cinema in the 
back of the gallery features 
thought-provoking visual 
assaults from Kelly Sears and 
Tara Knight. A herd of buffalo 
come screaming clown a wall in 
a fun sculpture by Kia Neill. 

Whether it's traditional or 
"new art, " all of the pieces share 
a fun and unpretentious nature, 
no doubt helped considenbly 
by UCSD alumna and star cura-
tor Alison Gingeras, whose 
credits include the Centte 
Pompidou in Paris and the 
Solomon R. Guggenheim 
museum in New York.

No homemade hair-gel needed for 
former SNL funny man Jimmy Fallon 
Crude, slapstick humor missing in new 

Farrelly brothers film 'Fever Pitch' 
By CHRlmNE CLARK 

Staff Writer 

you all know the guy. There is one in every family : the sports fanatic. For 
this parricular person, holidays, din-

ners and various other social gatherings 
must be arranged so that they' do not con-
flict with game schedules. This social lia-
bility was the inspiration for the new Peter 
and Bobby Farrelly comedy, "Fever Pitch ," 
starring Drew Barrymore and Jimmy 
Fallon. "Fever Pitch" was originally about a 
die-hard Red Sox fan who is so used to los-
ing that he can't commit to the girl of his 
dreams. But when the Farrelly brothers 
began shooting on location, in Boston, dur-
ing last year's baseball season, there was 
one problem - the Red Sox actually began 
winning. Ot only was the Red Sox victory 
in the 2004 World Series over the 
Cardinals one of the biggest stories in 
sporrs history, it also forced the Farrelly 
brothers to do some major script rewriting. 

"Fever Pitch" is the second film adapta-
tion to come from the Nick Hornby novel 
of the same name. The previous British ver-
sion starred Colin Firth as an obsessed soc-
cer fan . When production began on the lat-
est adaptation of "Fever Pitch," the film-
makers expected the Red Sox to do what 
they did best: lose. However, the Sox broke 
the 86-year-old "Curse of the Bambino" 
and won. One of the highlights of "Fever 
Pitch" is that it's a testament to baseball his-
tory because it integrates real sporting 
events into the plot (Barrymore and Fallon 
were even allowed to run out on the field 
with the Sox on victory night) . 

In "Fever Pitch," Barrymore, who also 
served as a producer on the project, is 
delightful as ever as Lindsay, the gi rl who 
captures Ben 's (Fa llon) heart. Lindsay, an 
ambitious businesswoman, thinks she has 
found Mr. Right when she meets Ben, but 
things change when sp ring t raining comes 
around and she soon discovers Ben's true 
love is the Red Sox. Although she is willing 
to compromise over the fact that Ben, a 
high school math teacher, makes less 
money than her, his Howard Hughes-like 
obsession with the Red Sox begins to com-

Film 
REVIEW 

plicate their relationship. He even goes so 
far as to say that the three most importallt 
things in his Ii fe are the Red Sox, sex and 
breathing, in that order. 

As Ben, Fallon, a former "Sa turday 
Night Live" cast member, finally fulfills his 
leading man potential after a worse-than-
disappointing performance in last year's 
"Taxi." Although Barrymore has yet to dis-
play her dramatic prowess, in "Fever Pitch" 
she shows that she's continued to marure 
into a woman since the days of "Ever After" 
and "Never Been Kissed." 

The charm of "Fever Pitch" is in watch-
ing Barrymore and Fallon together, both of 
whom put all of their adorable qualities on 
display. However, the real credit goes to the 
Farrelly brothers, both ew England 
natives and long-suffering Sox fans, for 
managing to make a romantic comedy that 
actually works. Unlike recent films in the 
same genre, "Fever Pitch" achieves a bal-
ance of humor and si ncerity. T he Farrelly 
brothers have left the gross-out humor of 
their earlier films, like "There's Something 
About Mary" and "Kingpin," and made their 
most mature movie to date. "Fever Pitch" 
may not have the slapstick hilarity of the 
Farrelly brothers' previous work (the PG-J3 
film has no sperm-in-the-hair sequences), 
but it is their best film in years. 

It is definitely an homage to the Red Sox, 
but you don't have to be from Boston to 
enjoy this endearing comedy.

Weirdo wunderkind: an interview with Deerhoofs Greg Saunier 
Trailblazing figurehead talks influences, unemployment and his favorite Stones song 

By IAN S. PORT 
Hiatus Editor 

O eerhoof is the kind of indie-rock band you'd expect to come from San Francisco. 
Sporting a nutty moniker to 
match a musical aesthetic that 
knows no precedent - it's as 
much Omelle Coleman as the 
Stooges - this shiftless foursome 
has earned a dedicated following 
the world over. With its latest 
tour opening tonight at the Che 
Ca fe, the GIII17·dian checked in 
with drummer and spokesman 
Greg Saunier for a few words on 
what keeps the eccentricity fl ow-
ing. 

GUllrdian: What's going 
through your heads these days 
that's making you want to make 
music? 

Greg Saunier: OK. I've got a 
story for you. It 's going to start off 
like I'm answering your question, 
and then it's going to sound like 
I'm not answering your question, 
and at the very end it is going to 
answer your question . 

I'm obsessed with the Rolling 
Stones. And with Google. you can 
get these news alerts senr to your 
inbox . So any time the word 
"rolling stones" appears any-
where, I get an alert in my inbox 
- and of cou rse that includes any 
time the word "rolling" or the 
word "stone" appears - so every 
day my e-mail is completely filled. 
(I cannot get these things turned 
off.) There was an article about 
completely something else, about 
when people get music stuck in 

their head . So I went and read this 
article, and I was completely 
amazed at what it said. They were 
doing some tests: They would call 
people on their cell phone at ran-
dom times during the day and say, 
"Do you have any music in your 
head'" And they said that normal 
people [laughs) had music in their 
head sometimes, musicians would 
have music in their head a much 
greater average, maybe around 3S 
percent, and they even found one 
guy who had music in his head 65 
percent of the time. They were 
aghast at this. And I was aghast 
reading it because I was like, 
"What in the world are they talk-
ing about? 1 do not remember the 
last time I didn 't have music in my 
head - I mean it's like a hundred 
percent of the time. And I was just 
really surprised. It really made me 
feel like I should go to the hospi -
tal. Am r really strange? So, to 
actually answer your question: It's 
not like we ever need to search for 
an excuse to start working on 
some new stuff. When I said I've 
got music in my head a hundred 
percent of the time I don't neces-
sarily mean my own music, or 
original music being created every 
waking and sleeping moment - I 
mean, I have something in my 
head and usually it's something I 
know - usually it's the Rolling 
Stones, anyway. 

G: What's your favorite 
RoUing Stones song? 

GS: That's a toughie isn't it? 
(That's what Keith Richards says. 
People say, "Keith, what's your 
favorite Rolling Stones song'" 

And he says it's like trying to 
choose your favorite child : You 
can't bring yoursel f to do it.) In 
my case, T probably have the 
strongest personal a ttachmenr to 
"Start Me Up" - and no, not 
because it was used on the 
Windows 95 commercial. That 
was the very first album I ever 
bought, Tattoo You, in like '8 1 or 
'82. I was in middle school at the 

time. Hearing "Stan Me Up" on 
my clock radio - I was just a kid, 
and 1 couldn't tell much music 
apart or anything, but I remember 
it dawning on me that I wa just 
totally into this sound: There was 
just something about it. I couldn't 
put my finger on it then , and [ still 
can't, really. But there 's something 
about the kind of texture. It 
sounds very human and has this 

kind of slightly rough .. . I don't 
want to say "sloppy" ... 

G: Raggedness? 

GS: That's a good word, one 
that is appropriately applied lO 
their music. Once I really figured 
alit what was going on, 1 wenr to

Beck 
Guero 
Geffen 

**** 

APparently, Beck is a dick Gust ask the Flaming Lips). But for being the 
coolest honky on the planet, 
maybe he's allowed to be a 
dick. 

For the past II years 
now, we've gotten used to 
Beck creating and mastering 
a new musical persona with 
each new album. Whether 
he becomes a Raggedy 
Andy bluesman, a funk-
thumping sex robot, a futur-
istic follcie or a hip-hop hip-
ster, Beck can introduce 
such a persona, fully under-
stand it, and walk away con-

fidem that no one but him-
elf could ever be 3S cool. 

On GUtrO, the album's 
character is, for the first 
time, Beck. This new 
"Beck" character is a combi-
nation of all that has come 
before: fat Dust Bros. beats, 
Delta-informed slide guitar, 
trademark Beck weirdness 
and even the settled-down 
lyrical style of Sea Changt. 
The first single, "E-Pro," 
samples Check YoUI' Head-era 
Beastie Boys and might 
actually be the worst song 
on the album, sounding so 
much like "Devil's Haircut" 
that 1996 will probably 
press charges. But each new 
song allows an old Beck 
character to surface while 
backing himself up with the 
rest of his doppelgangers. 
On Guero, it's Midnite 
Vultures Beck on the bass, 
OdeJay Beck on the beats, 
One Foot in the Grave Beck 
on the guitar, Sea Change 
Beck penning the lyrics and 
just plain-old-Beck singing 
and dancing to the fruits of 
his tiber-hip legacy. What a 
dick.

Queens of tile 
Stone Ale 

Lullabies to Paralyze 
Interscope 

*** 

Last year, news came out tha t Queens of the Stone Age were experi-
encing the usual rock band 
foul-ups: excessive party-
ing, feuding members and 
big heads. Frontman Josh 
Homme was forced to dis-
miss bassist and longtime 
friend Nick Oliveri. But 
Queens have not dissipated 
- with Homme (as ever) 
at the helm on vocals and 
guitar, the band picked up 
two new members and 
recently released Lullabier 

to Pamlyze, its fourth full -
length album. 

Llll/abies is, at its core, a 
good old-fashioned rock 
album, staying mostly con-
sistent with the group's 
previous work. Many of 
the tracks were recorded 
in one or two takes, 
explaining their rough-
around- the-edges feel. 
Riff-laden numbers like 
"Little ister" and "Burn 
the Witch" could easily 
earn heavy rotation on 
classic rock radio. But just 
when you think Queens 
may have become the 
Stones, Homme reminds 
us of his desert-stoner 
roots with hints of '70s 
psychedelia. 

Unlike so many of 
today's bands, Queens of 
the Smne Age make music 
that's meant to be played 
live. But one of their 
biggest achievements on 
LuHobies is that it is as bru-
tal as it is rhythmic; the 
new record, like its prede-
cessor, Songs for the Deaf, 
will suit both head bangers 
and yuppies alike.

The Killers 
Hot Fuss 

Island 

*** 

JealoUS}'. Four guys from Las Vegas put on some well-thought-out care-
less clothes, rub some 
Got2be gtmk in their hair, 
grab their guitars and go 
sing a song about the woes 
of paranoia, love and jeal-
ousy in a pseudo-English 
accent - and the fans eat it 
right up. Can life really be 
that easy? Seems so for the 
Killers, as their latest 
album, Hot Fuss, steadily 
remains at the top of the 
charts and in everyone's CD 
players. 

Hot Fuss stands out amid 

the new retro wave with 
some very distinct synthe-
sized styles tha t other "the" 
bands lack. "On Top" uses 
some clever handling of the 
old-school synthesizer a 13 
New Order that, instead of 
sounding forced , blends 
well with lead vocalist 
Brandon Flowers' lazy new-
wave charisma. 

The ca"eat is that the 
Killers risk sOlmding trite , 
with familiar lyrics that 
sound like they were writ-
ten by several artists over 
several decades. As written 
in "Somebody Told Me": 
"It's not confidential, I'v.: 
gOt potential." Maybe the 
boys spent too much time in 
the studio and not enough 
putting pen to paper. 

But who cares? Hot Fuss 
has got some damned great 
head-bobbing appeal. And 
it definitely has enough 
rock charm to make you 
"smile like you mean it." 
Fun and retro-worthy -
the Killers did well 

The KiUers will perform 
at RIMAC Arena on April 
12.

mind. you I was in middle school 
here - I listened to "Start Me 
Up" so many times, I taught 
myself to play drums by air drum-
ming along with Charlie [Watts, 
drummer for the Rolling Stones) 
to that song. Literally, every

planned out the fills - he was just 
reacting. So I feel like I've spent 
my entire musical existence on 
this weird tension between being 
really spontaneous and interactive 
- playing, kind of improvising 
around the songs that you're 
doing - then kind of going back 
and overanalyzing it. When we're 

nuance of every hi-
hat hit I had com-
pletely memorized . 
I had listened to the 
record so many 
times that it started 
getting scratches 
and skips and stuff 
and would jump 
ahead of a beat in 
some places - and 
I had that memo-
rized, too . But I 
was so fascinated by 
the way the guitars 
worked on this

song "Start Me Up" - the inter-
play, these twO guitars playing the 
same really simple thing, but the 
way that they'd improvise with it, 
and fiddle with it, and change the 
rhythm of it and play little varia-
tions off each other and it would 
kind of weave together and inrer-
lock. The really funny thing was, 
the Rolling Stones' next album 
was a much-maligned live album 
called Sri" Lift, on which they 
played "Start Me Up." The album 
was new, they were playing it over 
the speakers of the record store, 
and "Start Me Up" ca me on. And 
I was just completely crushed, 
because I was all set to hear those 
same drum fills and all those doo-
dads on the guitar and it was com-
pletely different. As a kid I just 
didn't realize that it was just spon-
taneous. It's not like Charlie

piness, too. That energy that 
sounded barely containable and 
full of texture and humanness and

G: Speaking of Keith 
Richards' feelings toward his 
work, how do you fee l about 
the work of Deerhoof7 Do you 
feel the same love for aU your 
work, or do you h ave a prefer-
ence for some of it? 

GS: Always, for the person 
doing it, it's hard to even listen to 
our music without just hearing all 
the flaws or just remembering 
working on it. Every time it gets 
to this one part of the guitar solo 
in "Riding on the Wind," by Judas 
Priest, I always get chills. From

the first time r heard it, for 
decades afterwards, every time I 
get chilled in one place. It's like 
your body remembers and it's 
incapable of not having the same 
reaction. 

G: So your reactions to your 
music are like that? 

G: A free-up 77? 

GS: [laughs] We could only 
make enough money on tour if we 
went on tour more. And we could 
only go on tour more if we quit 
our jobs. So at a certain point we 
had to take the plunge and see if it 
worked, see which happened first . 

G: How long ago was that? 

GS: A year or two ago. We 
didn 't all quit at exactly the same 
time. \iVe were all doing various 
jobs. Satomi IM atsuzaki ; vocals, 
bass ) was the editor of a magazine. 

G: What magazine? 

GS: It 's very difficult to hear 
any music that we worked on 
without having a specific memory 
of working on it and to try and 
imagine what somebody else 
mi ght hear. T he wei rd thing, of 
course, is that most of that time is 
being spent trying to judge it. We 
just get it to where we 're satisfied 
with it, which is pretty difficult for 
us, because we never agree on 
anything. Once the four of us are 
actually happy, we're like, "OK. 
Stop righ1 there." And that's usu-
a lIy after several months or years 
of tinkering. At that point, it does 
sound right to me, but it probably 
sounds like a total mess for any-
one else hearing it for the first 
time. But trust me: I'm just so 
happy that anyone even hears it. 
Forget about me trying to pick my 
favorite one. h 's already beyond 
my wildest dreams that anyone 
would want to listen to this stuff 
at all. 

GS: A small-circulation Bay

community of the South Bay 
peninsula. Actually it was a pretty 
serious job. John [Dieterich; gui-
tar) was doing document process-
ing at a legal firm . Chris [Cohen, 
guitar) was waiting tables in a 
Thai restaurant. T had an office 
job, I did lots of stapling and col-
lating. It was a little scary. There 
were those of us who did have 
some doubts : "If I quit , would I 
acnlally be needed to come back 
or is it possible that maybe I could 
be replaced by another 
stapler/collater?" [laughs) It was a 
calculated risk; so far it's working

kinship with the Rolling Stones, 
clearly, although they don't feel a 
kinship with me. [f I watch a live 
video or listen to their music and 
imagine the process that they 
went through to record it ... 
They're far from my only heroes, 
but they're among the millions of 
musical heroes that I or my band-
mates have. We do really look up 
to certain other musicians. A lot 
of times, you can just see what 
other people have done, and it 
can give you the feeling that you 
want to do the same thing as them 
- not exactly the same, but also 
do music your way. There 's no 
reason anyone shouldn't be able 
to feel kinship with the Rolling 
Stones; they' re just peopl e. I 
mean, they're incredibly rich, but 
that's not the thing that I feel a 
kinship with. Nor should it or 
need it be. I'm very low-income 
by any normal standard, but I 
don't necessari ly feel poor, 
because I'm college-educated and 
I could get a job again if I need to. 
So I don 't fe~1 disadvantaged in 
any way. For me, the kinship has 
to do with the feeling you come 
across. If I feel a lack of kinship, 
it'll be from a lack of me being 
able to relate to what the music is 
expressing.

feeling like I had the wind

direction was going to be. It did 
work for a time to try and pattern 
yourself after some type of hero. I 
learned so milch from my inter-
pretation of my hero's music. But 
as real people, I'm about as far 
from Keith Richards as possible in 
many ways. Maybe I would've 
been better keeping the pope as 
my hero - I mean, I don't smoke,

THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY. APRIL 7. 2005 

Men's tennis falls to 8-5 on season 
Loyola Marymount nearly blanks No. 10 UCSD 

8y ANGELA M. UN 
Staff Writer 

After a week's rest, the UCSD 
men's tennis team was unable to 
capture another Division I victo-
ry against Loyola Marymount on 
April 5. The 10th-ra~ed Tritons 
saw their record fall to 8-5 after an 
8-1 loss to Loyola Marymount in 
Los Angeles. 

The Tritons' sole victory came 
at No. I singles from senior captain 
Bryan Swatt, who is ranked No. 25 
in Division II singles. Swatt held 
off Loyola Marymount's Michael 
WojnarowicL in a close 7-5 first set 
win, and then closed out the match, 
6-4, in the second. 

"From what I had heard, Imy 
opponent] was a streaky player with 
a lot of flashy shots, so 1 just tried 
to stay solid and attacked when I 
could," Swatt said. 

The match began with two har-
rowing losses at No. 2 and No. 3 
doubles. The Lions' Beau Berglund 
and Carlos Malet defeated Swatt 
and freshman Will Phan in a close 
8-9 set at No. 2 doubles, while 
Loyola Marymount's Linas Gcenas 
and Nicolas Terrien beat junior 
Erik Oijala and fteshman Blake 
Meister, 7-9. 

The Tritons were uncharacter-
istically down 0-3 before the singles 
match-ups, which were marked by 
very close competition. Junior Brent 
Molden, playing o. 2 singles, was 
unable to keep his rhythm going 
after a second-set victory in a close 
wee-set defeat, 6-7, 6-3, 5-7 . At 
No. 3 singles, sophomore Seth 
Spector could not close out the first 
set in another close match against 

Berglund, losing 6-7, 2-6. 
Both Oijala, at No. 4 singles, 

and Phan, at No. 6 singles, lost in 
straight sets, 4-6, 3-6 and 4-6, 6-7, 
respectively. Playing No. 5 singles, 
Meister was un2ble to close out his 
match against Matt Phillips after 
piclcing up a lim set victory, 3 -6, but 
losing the next two sets 6-3,6-3 . 

"Last ye2r Loyola be2t us 4-3, 
so we just wanted to go in and win," 
Swatt said. ~Especially since it's the 
end of the season and our goal is to 
win as many [matches) as we can." 

The match was the second bout 
against a Division I school this sea-
son . The first was against Gonzaga, 
which the Tritons had little trouble 
defeating 9-0. As they he:ad into 
the last stretch of their season, the 
Tritons will be able to prove them-
selves again to four more Division I 
high-ranking teams: UC Riverside 
on April 9, Sacramento St2te on 
April 10, UC Davis on April 14 and 
Santa Clara on April 16. 

The beginning of the season was 
characterized by a six-game win-
ning streak that boosted the con-
fidence level of the young team. 
Unfortunately, after a difficult spring 
break medley of matches against 
high-caliber schools, including top-
ranked West Florida, the Tritons' 
overall record took a hit. The men 
played four matches in a five-day 
span, but lost three of the matches. 
On March 29, the men also picked 
up their fourth 9-0 victory over 
Western New Mexico with flawless 
performances in the singles line-up. 

At the beginning of the season, 
the Tritons' biggest problem was the 
inexperience of the young team at 
collegiate-level play, but after play-

ing half of the season, the Tritons are 
ready to take on the NCAA playoffs . 
Led by lone senior Swatt, the team 
consists of just three juniors and two 
sophomores. However, despite the 
youth of the tC2m, the men have 
silenced any doubters and have done 
very well this season. 

The Tritons are trying to repeat 
last year's victorious run in the 
NCAA playoffs, while cultivating 
a new generation of players. Many 
have credited head coach Eric 
Steidl mayer for putting together a 
great recruiting class and develop-
ing the players. 

"We're in good standing right 
now," SteidJmayer said. "If we win 
the rest of our Division 11 matches, 
it should put us in good position . 
Mental toughness is in the fore-
ftont of our minds. Each player 
has a particular thing they're prac-
ticing - whether it's serving or 
rerurning, each player is trying to 
improve one aspect. We are excited 
to improve in this last month." 

Up next for the Tritons will be 
Point Lorna Nazarene, currently 
9-7 this season, on April 7 in its 
second-to-Iast home game. T he 
season will end for the men with 
a tri p to Northern Cali fornia to 
play Sacramento State, UC Davis, 
Sonoma State and Santa Clara. 

"Davis wiU definitely be a good 
match," Swatt said. "We play them 
every year, and we always enjoy 
playing them becau e they give us 
a good match . Our morale is pretty 
high, and we're pretty confident 
right now. W e' re going to be play-
ing a lot of Division I schools and 
tha t wi II be a good test and get us 
mentally tough for the season ." 

Softball picks up pa~r at tournament 
Chaminade, W. New Mexico no match for Tritons 

8y MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Senior Staff Writer 

With masterful hitting, the 
UCSD softball team clinched 
major victories at both of its April 2 
games at the Easton Tournament of 
Champions at Cal State Stanislaus. 

The Tritons defeated Chaminade 
University by a score of 6-3 in game 
one, and proceeded to shut out 
Western New Mexico by a score of 
3 -0 in the nightcap. 

The two wins boosted UCSD's 
record to 14- 13 this season, push-
ing them over .500 for the first time 
since March 12 . 

The second-day victories meant 
that the Tritons improved to 3-1 in 
pool play in the tournament, which 
allowed them to take on Humboldt 
State on April 3 in the championship 
portion of the competition's Gold 
Bracket. 

Game one saw superb team 
action that propelled the Tritons 
early on. UCSD jumped out to an 
early 4-0 lead over Chaminade after 
the first inning of play. 

"We exploded offensively," 

senior captainJamie Hurst said. 
Two more runs over the next two 

innings ensured the Tritons' win as 
UCSD held on for a 6-3 viCtory. 

"It was an awesome team effort, 
especial ly from the pitchers, and we 
had some fantastic hits," Hurst said. 

Senior Breanne Cope and 
juniors Jenny Spencer and Desiree 
Franciscus combined for seven of 
the 10 UCSD hits in game one. 

Senior Kelley Bryant threw the 
first three innings before giving way 
to Nicole Fullerton, who threw the 
final four to preserve the win. 

Game two, against well-regarded 
Western New Mexico, saw sopho-
more Nildci Palmer and freshman 
Danielle Loll combine for half of 
the Tritons' eight hits in the game. 

"Palmer called change-ups that 
kept everyone on their toes," Hurst 
said. 

Lull Iud one RBI, as did 
Spencer, from the leadoff position, 
as UCSD overcame three errors for 
the shutout victory. 

Sophomore Tina Rowe picked 
up the complete-game shutout, 
allowing only four hits while giving

baseman EliZilbeth Vasquez (right) race to make a play on a flyball in a recent game. 

up no runs despite three errors and 
wallcing three. 

"Rowe pitched an absolutely 
great game," Hurst said. 

Sophomore Brittni Carino scored 
two of the UCSD runs, and junior 
Niki Anderson scored the third. 

"I've played for four years and 
this is the first time we beat Western 
New Mexico," Hurst said. "This is 
the best we played all season." 

The Tritons played the No. 4-
ranked Humboldt State on April 
3, the final day of the Easton 
Tournament of Champions. 

"Humboldt is a very good team 
and our first two plays off the game 
didn 't set the tone," Hurst said. 

The team saw its record fall to 
14-14 overall after losing a 10-1 
match to Humboldt State. 

UCSD could string together only 
three hits on the day. 

Rowe took the loss for the 
Tritons and fell to 6-6 on the year. 
Luick, Carino and Cope accounted 
for the three UCSD hits. 

"Carino and Cope had an excel-
lent offensive game," Hurst said. 

Despite the defeat, there were 
some notable bright spots. 

In particular, Franciscus 
was named to the All-Easton 
Tournament of Champions Team 
2fter going 6-for-16 in the tourna-
ment with two runs, including a 
home run and three RBIs over the 
five-gamc span for the Tritons. 

The Tritons' formidable oppo-
nent, Humboldt State, would later 
go on to beat Montana State-Billings 
and Seattle University to capture the 
tourn2ment crown, with a winning 
streak of 28 straight games. 
. UCSD will return to California 

Collegiate Athletic Association play 
next week with three doublehead-
ers. The Tritons will host Cal State 
Dominguez Hills on April 8 and Cal 
State Bakersfield April 9. The team 
will p12Y its third doubleheader in 
as many days, taking on Cal State 
Dominguez Hills on April 10.

Golf ties for fourth at Sonoma Invite 
By JOE SPANO 
Senior Staff Writer 

Fresh off a seventh-place finish 
last week, members of the Triton 
men's golf team stepped up their 
game to tie for fourth place out 
of II teams in the Sonoma State 
Invitational held at Santa Rosa Golf 
Course, in Santa Rosa, Calif., on 
April 4 and April 5. 

UCSD started things off strong 
in the morning of opening-day com-
petition with a round total of 298, 
only slipping a few strokes in the 
afternoon when they turned in a 
total of 302. On April 5, the Tritons 
buckled down and managed to put 
together a score of 293, which gave 
them a total of 893 for the tourna-
ment, 29 over par. 

Cal tate Bakersfield blew the 
competition away right Ollt of the 
gate, starting things off with a tour-

nament low of 280. They followed 
with rounds of 290 and 288, to finish 
with a score of 858, six under. 

Cal State Stanislaus took a distant 
second with an 888 by way of rounds 
of 301, 295 and 292. Notre Dame 
de Namur captured third place by 
putting together rounds of 309, 288 
and 293 IUr a total of 890. Cal State 
Monterey Bay tied with UCSD 
for fourth, also earning an 893 off 
rounds of 296, 306 and 291. 

Individually, sophomore Luke 
Leveillee stole the spotlight right 
away, putting up a team-low score 
of 69 on the morning of April 4. 
Leveillee carne back in the after-
noon to post a 74, but returned the 
second day of the event to shoot his 
second 69 of the tournament, to end 
wi th a 2 12 , four wlder par. This 
was Leveillee's first time leading the 
team this season. 

Junior Ryo Yamada took sec-

ond for the Tritons, tying for 16th 
overall with a 224. Yamada earned 
rounds of76 and 73, respectively, on 
April 4, and shot a 75 on April 5. 

Fellow junior Justin Grant came 
in third for UCSD, and earned a 
25th-place finish in the tournament 
with his score of 228. Grant rurned 
in rounds of77, 79 and a par 72 . 

Senior Joe Dolby was next for 
the Tritons, earning a 232, which 
resulted in a tie for 32 nd. Dolby 
shot a pair of 76s in the opening day 
of the tournament, and closed it Out 
with an 80 on April 5. 

Rounding out the team for 
UCSD was senior Brian Duckworth, 
whose 234 earned him a tie for 34th 
place. Duckworth rurned in scores of 
77, 80 and 77, respectively. 

The Tritons' next tournament 
will be April II and April 12 when 
they participate in the Buzzini 
Invitational in Turlock, Calif. 

Tennis: Women's team peaking right on time 
continued from page 20 

losing the first set handily, righted 
the ship and returned the favor to 
her opponent the next two sets for 
the three-set win, 1-6, 6-1, 6-0. At 
the No. 4 and No. 5 spots, McKee 
and junior Leigh Roberts came up 
with victories in tightly contested 
straight-set victories, 6-4, 6-2 and 
7-5, 6-4, respectively. At the No. 
6 spot, Bronowicki, who was called 
for spot duty at the last minute 
due to an injury Siddiqui sustained 
during doubles play, won her first 
set easily, 6-3, before struggling 
through her second set and tailing, 
4-6. In the decisive third set, how-
ever, Bronowicki got back on track 
and pulled out the win, 6-4. 

On April 3, the Tritons 
took on Azusa Pacific in the 
third-place match of the 2005 
Xenia Anastasiadou Memorial 

Tournament hosted by Cal Poly 
Pomona. Despite falling behind 
2-1 after doubles play (Dao and 
Hilker at the No. 3 spot earned 
the win), UCSD was able to take 
four of the six singles matches 
for the 5-4 match win. Hilker, 
Roberts, Bronowicki and Brown 
were victorious in singles play. 
The team went 2 -I overall in the 
tournament. The team it fell to, 
Abilene Christian University, won 
the tournament. 

"The girls really responded well 
to the pressure. [Hawaii-Hilo) was a 
good match for them, especially in 
singles," Willing said. "We're peak-
ing about the right time; this was the 
biggest match of the year. Now it's 
time to tone it down a bit, [and) get 
everybody rested and fresh before 
Regionals. The triclc is to keep the 
competition level high."

continued from page 20 

with two goals. Senior driver 
Jessica Wong and se nior two meter 
Lindsay Grossman equaled her 
performance, both earning a pair 
of goals, while Foe made four stops 
in goal. The Roadrunners put up a 
goal before the end of the second 
period to knock their deficit down 
to five at the end of the first half, 
but wouldn't dent the scoreboard 
again until late in the game. 

Before beating Cal State 
Bakersfield to finish off the week-
end, the Tritons found themselves 
on the defensive as Cal State 
Northridge controlled the first 
half to coast to a 10-5 win . The 
Matadors, led by hat tricks from 
Chari Christopher and Allison 

Brooks, lit up the scoreboard with 
eigh t goals in the first two periods, 
the most allowed by the Tritons in 
a half all season. UCSD could put 
up only two more goals in the sec-
ond half, whil e cursi ng Cal State 
Northridge's luck. To many, 
it 3eemed like all the M atadors' 
shots went into the cage and for 
most of the game, everything was 
going their way. 

"There was one instance where 
there were three of our girls and 
one Northridge player near the 
ball ; each of our girls got a hand 
on the ball but couldn't grab it, and 
the Northridge [player) picked up, 
rolled back and tossed in a go..!," 
Sanders said. "The whole game 
was almost surreal because every 

bounce and every shot was going 
orthridge's way. They scored 

eight goals in a half and even tlle 
No. I team in the nation, UCLA, 
didn't do that. " 

In spite of the setback, Clevenger 
picked up a hat trick of her own 
while Lyman and Grossman each 
added a goal. Foe recorded five 
stops for UCSD. 

Riding the highs of one of their 
most successful tournament perfor-
mances of the year, the Tritons will 
head to Davis for the 25th install -
ment of the Davis Shootout, where 
they will face Sonoma State and

Retort: Steroid accusers ride a bandwagon

He is currently dealing with tax 
problems and is always looking for 
a way to get quick cash. He is sell-
ing his World Series ring, he will 
appear on VHI's next installment 
of the Surreal Life and his book was 
quite an asset. However, Canseco's 
financial benefit led to congres-
sional hearings that tarnished the 
images of Mark McGwire, Sammy 
Sosa, Rafael Palmeiro and other 
possible Hall of Famers. Although 
McGwire looked guilty as sin in 
front of the committee, his possible 
crimes of the past mean nothing 
today. I don't care what the Big 
Mac did five years ago because he's 
never going to pick up a bat again. 
However, I do care that the next 
guy to hit 70 home runs will get his 
monstrous arms from working hard 
in the gym. 

Canseco is not the only one 
at fault; other people are jump-
ing on the accusation bandwagon 

for publicity, money or whatev-
er else they can gain from other 
people's downfall. Mike Anderson, 
Lance Armstrong's coworker tor 
two years, recently announced that 
he found a performance-enhanc-
ing drug in the six-time Tour de 
France winner's apartment in Spain. 
Armstrong is the most recent vic-
tim of these absurd allegations and 
he will not be the last if people 
like Anderson keep getting away 
with these PR moves. Armstrong, 
the man who has overcome tes-
ticular cancer to win more Tour de 
Frances than anyone, might now 
be remembered as a doper instead 
of as a role model. Armstrong, who 
is 5 feet II inches and weighs 165 
pounds, has as much use for these 
drugs 2S Tiger Woods or Michelle 
Kwan. He has been tested before 
every Tour de France and claims 
that he is one of the most tested 
athletes in the world. However, 
if these rumors continue, 2n ugly 

blemish from an illegitimate source 
could ruin his legacy. 

During the Salem trials, anyone 
who was abnormal or spectacular 
or stood out in any way was singled 
out as a "witch" and was sent to 
trial. Today, it seems that most 
dominant athletes are suddenly fac-
ing questions about the legitimacy 
of their accomplishments. As more 
and more accusations are made, 
more and more will surface. It has 
become a craze just like the one 
in Salem ovcr 300 years ago, and 
someone sane needs to stop it. 

Baseball and other sports are 
doing as much as possible to moni -
tor their athletes, and after the 
MLB suspensions this week, the 
new policies are obviously work-
ing. As fans, we need to ignore the 
random allegations and only make 
decisions based on concrete evi-
dence. Once we do that, thi witch 
hunt will end and the sports world 
can begin to regain its sanity .

Tritons baseball dismisses Stanislaus, 14-4 Steroids: A 
witch hunt 

revisited 
Morehead hits for cycle while Boutilier records seventh win 
By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 

Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD baseball team 
wasted no time spoiling the day 
for Cal State Stanislaus starter 
Josh Berrington, who gave up six 
runs in 1.2 innings en route to 
the Tritons' 14-4 win on April 3 
at Triton Baseball F ield . 

Sophomore catcher and 
Ca liforn ia Collegiate Athletic 
Association Player of the Week 
David Morehead hit for the 
cycle, going 4-for-4 with a pair 
of doubles, a triple, a home run 
and six RBIs. Senior pitcher 
Logan Boutilier (7- 1), the ace of 

CSD's pitching staff, scattered 
10 hits , struck out seven and gave 
up four runs in seven inning of 
work. 

The Tritons (19- 10 overall, 
14-8 CCAA) cored three runs in 
the first inning from Morehead's 
RBI double, senior . shortstop 
Keith Hernandez's RBI sacrifice 
fly and junior outfielder Matt 
Lawson ' RBI triple. 

UCSD added three more runs 
in the second inning, tarting 
with a fie ld ing error by Cal State 
Stanislau (16-20 overall, 10-11 
CCAA) that scored senior left-
fielder C raig King and senior 

second baseman RieL:y Pinnochio. 
Morehead later tripled to score 
senior third baseman Alex Cascon 
to put the Tritons ahead, 6-0. 

With the bases loaded and 
one out in the bottom of the 
third inning, the Warriors scored 
a run when Boutilier hit Jeren 
Livernois with a pitch. Boutilier 
then forced two infield popouts 
to end the inning, stranding three 
runners. 

Cal State Stanislaus continued 
to chip away at the Tritons' lead, 
adding another run in the fourth 
inning when Josh Rodriguez 
scored on Boutilier's wild pitch . 

But UCSD regained its four-
run lead with two more runs in 
the bottom of the fourth to make 
the score 8-i. With two outs, 
Lawson doubled to right field, 
sendi ng Morehead and senjor 
designated hitter Joel Cla rk 
home. 

T he Tritons exploded again, 
driving in four more runs in the 
fifth and giving Boutilier a com-
fortable 12-2 advantage. King 
singled a bunt and advanced to 
second on an infield error that 
also scored junior pinch hitter 
Damian Fante. With two outs 
and two men on, Morehead hit 
a home run to left field before

Hawaii--Hilo, 7 --2 

Team potentially earns home-
court advantage at Regionals 

By EVAN WANG 
Senior Staff Writer 

Following a third-place finisn 
at the Cal Poly Pomona invita-
tional, the lOth-ranked UCSD 
women's tennis team faced off 
against 13th-ranked Hawaii-Hilo 
in its biggest match of the season 
and emerged with a convincing 
7-2 victory. 

According to head oach Liz 
LaPlante, the match had major 
implications down the road for 
how the teams would be seeded 
in regional competition. UCSD 
is now all but guaranteed a No. 2 
seeding (behind BYU Hawaii) in 
the Western Region, and Hawaii-
Hilo will be No.3, which means 
that should the teams meet again 
in the regional tournament, the 
Tritons will have home-court 
advantage. This makes traveling to 
Hawaii unnecessary, a relief for the 
team, already on a limited budget. 

The Tritons and the Vulcans 
met at the Northview Courts on 
April 5 for an afte rnoon match. 
The sky blue, the weather wann 
and the winds calm, the con-
ditions were perfect for tennis. 
With the stakes so high, the 
Tritons came out with a sense of 
purpose, and clearly put their best 
show on the court. T he home 
crowd, rambunctious and rowdy 
in its support, did its part to help 
the team, coming out in numbers 
to cheer from the start. 

Becau e of the competition 
we've had in the last week and a 
half, the intensity and the level 
of play was pretty high," assistant 
coach Timmer Willing said. "That 
carried right into our match with 
Hilo. It was easy to maintain the 
mental intensity; it was nlya mat-
ter of physical preparation." 

UCSD took two of the three 

doubles matches, with No.2 duo 
sophomores Kristin Bronowicki 
and Katie McKee and No.3 dou-
bles team senior Jasmin Dao and 
junior Marissa Hilker both taking 
8-4 decisions. At the No. 1 spot, 
despite superb net play by junior 
Tara Siddiqui and strong serving 
by sophomore Liz Brown, the 
players could not consistently get 
the ball by the Vulcan volleyers, 
and the Triton pair fell, 3-8. 

The victory for Bronowicki 
and McKee broke them out of a 
mini-slump, which saw them lose 
three straight matches after start-
ing the season 12- 1, including a 
10-match winning streak. 

"They're perfectionists, and 
really want to win," Willing said. 
"Sometimes, they can get uptight. 
[LaPlante] worked with them, and 
got them to relax and take a step 
back to regroup. That got them 
to slow things down and to con-
centrate on how to play, rather 
than just winning and losing." 

In singles play, matches were 
filled with streaky performances. 
At the top of the ladder, No. 1 
sophomore Marsha Malinow, 
despite battling a toe infection that 
had kept her out of doubles play, 
put on a clinic early, crushing her 
opponent's weak serves en route to 
a 6-2 first-set win, and a 3-0 lead 
in the second. But then her oppo-
nent, Mai Fujii of Hawaii-Hilo, 
began to tum the tables, stonning 
back to win the second set, 5-7, 
and squeaking by Malinow in the 
third-set super tiebreaker, 8- 10 to 
complete the comeback. 

F ujii would be the only Vulcan 
singles winner. Dao, playing at 
the No. 2 spot, outslugged her 
opponent in straight sets, 6-1, 6-
1. At the No.3 pot, Hilker, after 

See TENNIS. Page 19 

Lawson flied out to end the 
inning. 

The Warriors made it 12-4 
on two unearned runs when Pete 
Hernandez singled to right to 
score Chad Gordon and Mike 
Gonzalez in the top of the sixth 
inning. 

The Tritons scored their 
final two runs in the seventh 
on Morehead's RBI double and 
Lawson's RBI triple. 

Juniors Ryan Leake and Matt 
Sweany pitched the final two 
innings, shutting down Cal State 
Stanislaus to secure the win. This 
victory concluded the four-game 
series with both teams coming 
out even, 2-2. 

UCSD took control against 
Cal State Dominguez Hills on 
April 6, as the Tritons strolled 
to victory, 20- 11. Details were 
unavailable at press time.

40-goal effort pushes 
polo to 3-1 at tourney 

By DANIEL DIAl 
Senior Staff Writer 

The sometimes-timid offen-
sive attack of the o. 19 UCSD 
women's water polo team became 
a force to be reckoned with as the 
Tritons rolled up 40 goals in four 
games to finish 3-1 at the Loyola 
Marymount Invitational on April 
1 and April 2. 

UCSD's depth and potency 
on offense was evident from the 
beginning of the tournament, 
when the Tritons posted five 
straight goals to pull away from 
U niversity of Redlands, 10-4, 
on April I. \Vhile the Tritons 
kept up the pace with a 15-
2 pasting of Sonoma State on 
April 1 and a 10-2 defeat of 
Western Water Polo Association 
foe Cal State Bakersfield, they 
were not able to overcome some 
red-hot shooting by No. 17 Cal 
State Northridge in a 10-5 loss 
on April 2. With nine goals on 
the weekend, senior driver Tobi 
Lyman registered nearly a quar-
ter of UCSD's offensive output, 
and 11 Tri tons registered at least 
one point during the tourna-
ment. UCSD now stands at 9-
13 on the season, 1-1 against 
WWPA opponents. 

"We were doing everything 
that we needed to do to get better, 
especially with some big games 
coming up," UCSD head coach 
Larry Sanders said. "Even if the 
caliber of the teams we played 
wasn't the highest, we still got 
opportunities to sharpen up our 
depth and run our new plays." 

Lyman kicked off her goal-
scoring frenzy with a hat trick 
ag-ainst Redlands as the Tritons 
tallied four unanswered goals 
in the third period to leave the 
Bulldogs in the dust after a close 
opening frame . Sophomore 
two meter Sarah Bajorek's goal 
towards the end of the first peri-
od gave the Tritons a 2-1 lead 
that they wouldn't relinquish 

for the rest of the game. UCSD 
tacked on two more goals Defore 
Redlands added on a point for a 
4-2 scoreline at the half. 

enior utili ty Courtney 
Clevenger and junior two meter 
Kirsten Frazer were right behind 
Lyman, each with a pair of 
goals, while junior driver Flynn 
LaRochelle and sophomore two 
meter Britta Nordstrom each 
had a score in the 10-4 victory. 
Alie Hower also earned a hat 
trick for Redlands. Junior Kaitlin 
Foe made four stops between the 
posts for UCSD. 

The Sonoma State Sea wolves 
proved to be even less of a chal-
lenge for the goal-hungry Tritons, 
who posted five unanswered goals 
in the first period and entered 
halftime with an 8-1 advantage. 
Ten Tritons got their name on 
the score sheets, led again by 
another hat trick from Lyman 
while Clevenger, Nordstrom and 
sophomore Judy Emaus each 
recorded a pair of goals. At least 
six of the scorers came off the 
bench as Sanders was able to 
give his roster more experience 
witll new offensive schemes. The 
15 -2 drubbing of the Sea wolves 
earned the Tritons a perfect first 
day at the Loyola Marymount 
Invitational. 

"Everybody got to get in and 
we got some new things going. 
This will help us build up our 
depth in the future so that when 
someone needs a breather, we 
can send in someone for a few 
rrumltes and be just as versatile," 
Sanders said. 

UCSD raced out of the gate 
once again against Cal State 
Bakersfield on April 2, putting 
up four consecutive goals in the 
first period to cruise to a 10-
2 victory over the Roadrunners 
for its first WWPA triumph of 
the ea on. Lyman was at the 
top of the score sheet yet again

The Sports 
Retort 

RaelEnteen 

I n 1692, a small town named Sa le m Village was rocked by numerous allegations of witch-
craft. The citizens of this area went 
around accusing people with no 
evidence of evi l doings. After the 
hysteria died down in Salem, 24 
people were dead ei th er from hang-
ings or prolonged jail sentences 
coupled wi th torture. 

In 2005 , the sports world is 
under scrutiny becau e of recently 
discovered evidence of steroid use 
in baseball and many other sports. 
Fans, politicians and former play-
ers are now acting like the citizens 
of Salem, throwing arowld fa lse 
accusations and defaming some of 
the greatest names in sports of our 
generation. 

It all started back in 2003, when 
the infamous BALCO lab was raid-
ed and the world became addicted 
to this s teroidal soap opera. Two 
years la ter, Jose Can eco's tell-all 
book and the congressional hea r-
ings have made the Steroid Era intO 
front-page news. 

Like most fans, I am in favor 
of cutting down on this "advan-
tllge" and making sure that talent 
and desire instead of chemicals and 
syringes will decide furure games. 
However, this fad of random alle-
gations is not the way to fix this 
problem. 

I don't see why people feel the 
need to do this; Major League 
Baseball is headed in the right direc-
tion with its new policies, and other 
sports will soon follow, if necessary. 
On April 3, Tampa Bay outfielder 
Alex Sanchez was the first player 
penalized under MLB's new ruJes 
regarding performance-enhancing 
drugs. He was suspended for 10 
days and can face much worse if he 
is caught again. 

Although 10 days may not 
seem serious enough , the goal for 
the sports world should not be to 
catch as many users as possible 
and punish them harshly. Instead , 
we should focus on improving 
the state of sports for the future . 
When high school players open 
their sports section to read about 
Sanchez or the 38 minor leaguers 
caught on April 4 they will under-
stand what steroid use means for 
their futures. By making examples 
of proven steroid users, MLB is 
scaring their future stars away 
from using performance-enhanc-
ing drugs. Criticizing any player 
who has gained a couple of pounds 
over the off-season does nothing 
but create gossip and fu.el this fin -
ger-pointing craze. 

This modem-day witch hunt 
has done nothing but hurt the 
sports world. Numerous athletes 
are being singled out and accused 
just so someone like Canseco 
can gamer publicity and money. 
Canseco's book, "Juiced: Wild 
Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash 
Hits and How Baseball Got Big," 
is the perfect example of how not 
to deal with this problem, and also 
shows us that he has question-
able motives. Canseco released 
the book, which reached the New 
York Times bestseller Jist, during a 
troublesome financial time for rum.
