UC Regents respond In 
abortion controversy 

Hearing set In San Diego County 
Superior Court on March 16 

by Laura A Richter 
News Editor 

The UC Regents have responded in a Fe.b. 15 demurrer to the 
challenge of unconstitutionality in subsidizin~ abortion services 
through Reg Fees by three students, claimmg that " It is the 
position of the university that the plaintiffs have not properly 
presented and , indeed under any circumstances cannot maintain 
these claims." 

Scheduled to be heard on March 16 in the San Diego County 
Superior Court, the demurrer answers the complaint filed by 
Burton Shamsky , lawyer for Margaret Patton a nd Albin 
Rhomberg, UCSD students, who are currently attending the 
University under an agreement whereby their Reg Fees ($120 per 
quarter) are deposited with the Superior Court clerk, pending the 
litigation, and a third student, Susan Erzinger, who was to be an 
entering freshman at UCSD in 1977, now attends the University of 
San Diego. 

In the demurrer, elements of the complaint were termed 
" uncertain in that it cannot be determined therefrom how or in 
what manner the university has violated the plaintiffs ' rights 
under the United States Constitution." 

The document concludes by asking that, "The demurrer be 
sustained ; plaintiffs take nothing by their complaint; the 
university be awarded its costs of suit; and such other relief as the 
court considers appropriate." 

A ttached to the demurrer is a lengthy " memorandum" of points 
and authorities in support of demurrers to complaint; " which is 
composed of a preliminary statement, reprints of the UCSD 
catalog, and documents dealing with changes and policies 
involved with fee rates and payments over the last several years. 

The 1972 Planning and Budget Manual defines the Reg Fee as "a 
charge made to each student for services which benefit the student 
and which are complementary to, but not part of, the Instruction 
and Research Programs." Changes in rates and authority over the 
designation of the fees are also outlined within the memorandum. 

The plaintiffs state in their complaint that, "Such student 
services funded directly, or indirectly by said insurance contract 
(with the American National Financial Corporation), by the 
compulsory registration fee at the Student Health Center or at 
other locations on or off the campus include abortion counseling, 
abortion referal and abortion ." 

Subsequently, it is stated by the plaintiffs that " refusal to pay 
said fee is a matter of conscience in that the plaintiffs believe that 
abortion constitutes the taking of human life without due process 
of law, and that the payment by the plaintiffs of that portion of the 
compulsory registration fee used directly or indirectly to fund 
abortions would place them in the position of being forced, as a 
condition of attendance at said university, to pay for the taking of 
innocent human life, in a cruel, savage and painful manner."

by Dan St. Claire Bacon 

S&aff Writer 
Termed as "a major public 

health issue," the saccharin 
controversy was debated at a 
recent symposium, headed by 
Third College Provost Joseph 
Watson. Panelists faced the 
question of whether or not the 
substance is carcinogenous, 
and if so, if it would be banned. 

Dr. Arnold Brown, head of 
the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota 
pointed out that there haw' 
been tests on purified saccharin 
and non-purified saccharin. 
Those for purified saccharin 
were negative, and the results 
for the non-purified saccharin 
were positive. Brown noted that 
this seemed to indicate that 
sacc harin itself was not 
carcinoaenous, but the impuri-
ties which are added in the 
production process are. 

The other panelists agreed, 
that the saccharin we digest is a 
mild carcinogen, that is, it 
does cause cancer. Saccharin 
does cause cancer in animals so 
it is assumed to cause cancer in 
humans as well. We accept 
these animal tests because in a 
sense we presently have no 
other choice, said Brown. He 
further indicated that "We do 
know that out of the 27 
compounds that are known to 
cause cancer in humans only 
one doesn't cause cancer in 
animals." 

Saccharin is considered a 
mild carcinogen because 
chances are, according to the 
FDA. for every 132 pound 

person that takes ISO ml of 
saccharin (the amount in an 
average diet drink) daily, 4 out 
of every 10,000 will get bladder 
cancer. The FDA bases these 
statistics mainly on the 
saccharin experiments done in 
Canada. 

One of the major criticisms of 
these tests is the enormous 
amount of saccharin given to 
the control rats. The daily 

dosage is equivalent to the tionofSanDiegoCountyforthe 
amount of a saccharin in 1000 funding and construction of a

Letter from the M.E. Bekken's letters 
Booksto re -im proy emen t8 ~::~ policy of printing all letters 

to the editor is being taken 
advantage of, and perhaps it should 
be changed. Another letter arrived last night from my imaginary source. It seems that he or she feels that more can be improved in this 

university than just the final examinations system. 
"Dear Sir," it said. , 
"It has come to my attention that the University Bookstore has 

come u~der fire many times for various reasons, the bulk of the 
complaints coming in during the first two weeks of each quarter. 

"Some of these complaints include long lines during the first 
week rush to get books; a small or even a lack of an adequate 
supply of books for certain classes; and an excess amount of time 
required to wait for a refund, even though there may be no one in 
line in front of you. 

"Here are some suggestions of my own which may come in 
handy: To resolve the long wait in lines during the first week of the 
quarter, perhaps students should be allowed times during which 
they can purchase at the bookstore for the first week. 

"For example, all students with a last name beginning with A 
could purchase their books from 8-U on Monday morning and so 
on. 

"Each day there would be some time allocated when anyone 
may pu~hase his books. . 

Jon Bekken has submitted and 
had printed a tedious series of 
absurd letters that are an 
outrageous waste of space. He even 
recently (TT, Feb. 13) had the 
nerve to complain that some of his 
letters are either not printed or 
printed incorrectly. 

I can assure Bekken that last 
year, 3S TT editor. I printed all of 
his meanderings, and I suppose the 
paper is doing the same thing this 
year. If some of Bekken's letters 
are actually not being printed, 
perbaps he is forgetting to mail 
them. 

Further , I ask that TT to 
reconsider its letters policy, in an 
e(fon to spare UCSD students the 
weekly installments of Bekken's 
wisdom.

Power of the press 
At UCSD the old ada,e "power of the press beloDls to anyone 

who owns one" hal undertone a little twist. Here, It's "power of 
the press belOllJS to any troup that receives student media 
fundin,. " Somet1mes It aeerna as If just about everyone has their 
own 'DeCtal interest tournaI. 

Besides the" student" newspaper, the Triton Times, we have the 
leftist journal, the New Indlea&or, the ri,htist journal, the Free 
Triton; the Chicano journal, VOl Fron&eriza; tt, _ Jewish journal, 
L'CII.ylm; and a "overnment mouthpiece journal, the AS 
Bulle&ln. And, as soon as some more money is scraped to,ether, 
we'll have a black journal and a "progressive" journal. This 
listing doesn't even take into account the proliferation of 
newsletters and scholarly-type journals. 

Obviously, the power of the press - owned or borrowed - is 
important. As any of the staffers on the special interest journals 
could tell you, it's a hell of a way to get your unadulterated point 
across to the masses. 

In fact, press power is important enough to warrant a massive 
expenditure of student dollars - or, at least, someone decided that 
some time ago. The controversy, then inevitably arises over how 
the cash will be divided out. 

Just recently, this controversy has been referred to by two 
extremely diverse sources - Free Tri&on editor Tom Tanana and 
the New Indicator staff. Both Tanana and the New Indlca&or are 
concerned that only one person , the Communications 
Commissioner, controls the entire media budget. 

Everyone involved in the journalism here seems to have his own 
opinion on this matter. Currently, Communications 
Commissioner Dave Eisen is making all the decisions himself, 
alUJough the AS and Student Center Board can override him if 
either wishes to do so . 

Eisen is mulling over various proposals to recreate the 
Communications Board, possibly with a new name. He has written 
a tentative proposal, which would create a five-member board, 
comprised of the communications commissioner, two of his 
appointees and two AS Council appointees, that would make all the 
decisions concerning student media. . 

Eisen's proposal has merit, in that the committee would be 
small, and so hopefully more efficient than a large, unwieldy body. 
But his proposal has a fatal flaw, as it concentrates all the 
decision-making power in the AS. The student government should 
not have control over the student media. Control over the media 
should be decentralized, so that no one group can dictate its path. 

Another idea now being considered comes from former 
CommBoard head Ralph Hawkins . It would certainly 
decentralize the control as it would be comprised of appointees 
from each college, the AS, the Graduate Student Council and each 
student media. 

The problem with Hawkins' board lies in the appointees from the 
various media. Just as the government should not control the 
media, neither should one journal have any say over what another 
journal is doing. Each journal has different goals and methods, 
and should not have to explain itself to the other journals. 

An ideal communications board would be one that combines 
decentralized power over decision-making with some expertise in 
the ways of journalism, so it could make intelligent decisions. The 
AS, as guardian of the Student Activity Fee, could allocate a lump 
sum for media each year, thus keeping its hands off the actual 
decision-making channels. The CommBoard could be comprised 
of one appointee from each college. th8 AS and the Graduate 
Student Council, with the communications commissioner serving 

asch~~ . 
And, to allow some expertise in the ways of journalism (since 

most students don't have any), an advisory board could be 
created. The board could be comprised of set representatives, one 
each from a straight daily paper, an alternative paper, a radio 
station and so forth. This wouldn't be an Intrusion on the 
CommBoard's powers, since it wouldn't have to take the advisory 
committee's advice. But the advisory committee would be there, 
and - whether it was wanted or not - its advice would, based on 
past experience, be needed. 

But the most important thing that will have to be decided is the 
exact relationship between the CommBoard and the media , What 
powers does the CommBoard have? Can it demand to see a 
journal's copy before it is printed? (After all, it is the publisher of 
the journal.) Can it tell a journal that such and such an article 
cannot be published, or that such and such a subject should be 
covered in a different manner? 

Until this subject is clearfy defined, any CommBoard, no matter 
how well constructed, will never rise above the status of a mere 

house for student funds.

Brain splitting operation 
has unknown side effects 

LEARN TO FLY 

by Joaquin Behindu 
Staff Writer 

In what was essentially an 
extrapolation of Wilson Bryan 
Key's lecture, Robert Mash-
man of Counseling and Psycho-
logical Services discussed 
" imaginal thinking" theories in 
Part III of the Mind Games 
series sponsored by Warren 
College. 

The lecture opened with a 
brief interview of recent 
research into the "Split Brain" 
phenomenon. As an attempt to 
sto p a form of epilepsy , 
surgeons severed the corpus 
callosum which joins the right 
and left halves of the brain . The 
resulting operation revealed 
some startling evidence. 

Through various experi-
ments it was shown that those 
persons with split brains (if 
they were right handed) could 
not describe, verbally" what 
was in the left hand If some-
thing was placed in it. 

Further studies showed that 
the language center of humans 
was in the left hemisphere of 
the brain while the right half 
was more creative. Masman 
characterized the left half as 
something that" can utilize bits 
of infoPl'llation sequentially." 
He added that " more concrete 
information is known about the 
left because its functions are 
more concrete ." The right 
hemispht!re is "more oriented 
toward passive comprehen-
sion" and more spatial.

Men's, women's tenni's 
ace their opponents 

by Karen Hunter 
Staff Writer 

Visiting Point Lama College fell to UCSD's women's tennis team 
Wednesday afternoon 8-0 as the Triton women upped their season to 3-2. 
UCSD's modest two match win streak was hailed by Occidental last 
Friday as they notched a 5-4 decision. In Riverside, UCSD's men 's team 
won the Riverside tournament by winning three straight matches. 

Women win & lose 
Pt. Lama College fell victim to the overpowering racquets of the 

women 's tennis team on Wednesday at the Muir Courts, as the female 
Tritons won every match of the afternoon . 

As Coach Chris Mattson pointed out. "Pt. Lorna has not traditionally 
been one of the stronger teams." This factor , combined with good 
playing, gave the women their third victory of the season. 

Lisa Winsten , with some steady play in the third setofhernumberone 
singles match, outlasted her opponent, 7-6. 6-7, 6-2. DeeDee Randall , 
-playing at number six singles, easily defeated her opponent. 6-2. 6-1. 

Due to lack of time the number one doubles match was not played. 
However, the team of Myers /Archer posted a victory tortne Tntons 6-3 , 
2-6, 6-1. In the number three doubles match Holzman/ Winston whipped 
their opponents 6-1 . 6·1. . 

Last week's action saw UCSD defeat USIU 5-4 and ~outhwestern 6-3. 
In the USIU match , number one singles player Debbie Shapiro won 7-5, 
6-3 whil~ Vanderburgh, plC!ying in the number four slot, won easily 6-2, 6-
O. Last Wednesday, the Triton women competed against Southwestern 
without their five top players but still won handily . 

Against Occidental, the Tritons scored two victories in singles and two 
in doubles . Amy Goldenberg and Teri Archer both emerged victorious 
in fourth and fifth singles (scores not available) while the doubles dous 
of Elizabeth VandenBurgh and Cathy Kozmary and Goldenberg and 
Archer each won in straight sets. 

The loss to Occidental dropped UCSD's overall record to 2-2 Coach 
Chris Mattson felt her team has "put forth a strong effort and' plilyed 
some good matches. I 've been impressed by our hustle and spirit This 
team has a special spark." . (Please tum to page 7)

Four events will be contested this afternoon as competition 

continues in the second day of the third annual UCSD Superstars 
event. Competition began yesterday with the weightlifting and 60 
yard dash. 

The Superstars features twelve total events, including three new 
ones this year - bowling (held at Pacific Beach Bowl) , the high 
jump and mile run . Contestants wjJJ be awarded points in a fashion 
similar to the Olympic decathlon , with a maximum of 1000 and a 
minimum of no points given for each event. 

~veral recor~s in individual events appear to be in danger of 
fall~ng as two-tIme defending men 's champion Eric Macy. 1M 
codlrectors Lee Johnson and Mike Hipp and Mark Aumann all 
have entered the four day competition. 

Open to all UCSD students, faculty and staff (the latter two 
groups must hold recreation priviledge cards). individuals must 
compete in eight of the ten individual events to be eligible for the 
title . 

~ote~bl~ records in individual events include: 310 pounds in the 
welghthftmg by Lee Johnson , 6.7 in the 60 yard dash by Bob 

Barm~yer and three standards in women 's competition by 
Ste.Hme Bloss . Macy holds the men 's record for most points (5465) 
whIle Schwabby Vees holds the team record with 14149. 

Competitors may enter events as individuals or on a team basis 
with one team having a t least two but no more than five member~ 
(a t least one in the opposite sex) . 

The schedule of remaining events and where they will be held'

Bohan runs 2:16 800m 
It 's too bad first year UCSD 

student Bridget Bohan didn 't 
run in last Friday night 's San 
Diego Invitational at the Sports 
Arena. She would have given 
the eventual winner and world 
record holder Mary Decker a 
run for her money in the 800 
meters. 

Instead of running in the 
prestigious Jack-in -the-Box 
games, Bohan competed in the 
women's All-Cal track and field 
championships last weekend at 
UC Santa Barbara, finishing 
second in the 800 meter run, 

. clocking a sensational 2: 16, not 
fa r off Decker's world sta nda rd 
of 2: 04 . 

Only two other Triton gals 
entered the meet. Debbie Altus 
won her heat in the 1500 meters 
in 5: 30 but failed to reach the 
finals as the winnjng time in the 
second heat was under five 
,ninutes. Cathy Gardner also 
ran in the 800 meters in 2: 36. 

Spirit? 
A group of students have 

scheduled a second edition of 
UCSD Spirit Night for tomor-
row night 's varisty basketball 
game against Azuza Pacific. 

At the first spirit night -
which was scheduled due 
largely to the efforts of Muir 
College Re si dent Advisor 
Chuck Flores - over 250 fans 
filled the Main Gym to cheer 
UCSD on to a come-from -
behind victory over Cal 
Baptist. 

Included in the night ' s 
activities will be a raffle for 
various gifts, a drill team show 
at hal.f.time, a cheering 
competition between students 
from the four colleges, and a 
sock hop after the game. 

The Azuza Pacific game will 
be the last home contest for the 
varsity team.

Tubes: euphpric, improvement; 
Waits: twisted and talented 
It's hard to walk out after a 
Tubes concert and not have 
feellngs of euphoria . And as I 
exited the Fox Theater last 
Sunday night after yet another 
vibrant , innovative Tubes 
performance, I felt euphoric. 
The euphoria was short-lived, 
however, due in part to a visit to 
the bar at the EI Cortez Hotel. 
The sign in the lobby read Drug 
Enforcement Agency Conven-
tion. Bam. Back 10 the real 
world . And just tnree blocks 
from where Quay Lewd was 
standing a few minutes ago. 
Only' in San Diego. 

It had been over two years 
since I had last seen the Tubes, 
and I was kind of curious to see 
if they had burned out and 
become just another novelty on 
the rock 'n roll scene. Much to 
my surprise, the Tubes are 
actually an improved band 
since I saw them last. Their 
enticing new show, coupled 
with the relea.se of the What Do 
You Want From Live ablum. 
could be an indication that the 
Tubes are far from retiring into 
history I oblivion. 

The key to the band's success 
is lead sinter/performer Fee 
Waybill, maintaining a stable 

Tennis •.. 
(Continued from page 4) 

of different characterizations, 
ranging from British glitter-
rocker Quay Lewd to Tom 
Jones to the SM master of 
" Mondo Bondage." Waybills 
energy level is contagious, and 
he maintains the high energy 
level throughout the entirety of 
the show. 

The Tubes want so badly to be 
known as a rock ' n roll band 
that it's almost funny . I guess 
they became a bit tired of being 
thought of as the token jesters. 
So instead of opening with 
Waybill and accompanying 
theatrics. the band plays some 
rock material, usually with Bill 
Spooner on vocals . Without 
dancers and props in the way. 
the band gets its turn in the 
spotlight. The musicianship is 
solid but not too exciting. 

But rest assured, the Tubes 
do have some very exciting, 
funny material , including 
" Don ' t Touch Me There" 
featuring Re Styles, " It's a 
Drag". a musical story about 
cigarettes, and the usual show-
stopper " White Punks On 
Dope." 

- Tim Mackenzie 

The Triton men dethroned two-time defending champion 
University of Nevada Las Vegas at the Riverside tourney, scoring 
three straight match wins. UCSD shut out host Riverside 9-0, 
edged Cal State Long Beach 5-4 and topped UNLV 6-3. 

Paul Metsch was the only Triton to win all three of his number 
one singles matches, topping Jim Ferguson of UCR 6-4, 7-5; bill 
Nardi o( CSLB 4~ . 6-4 and then Mike Silva of UNLV 6-3, 1Hl. 

UCSD coach Tad Yamaguchi felt the windy condition for the 
CSLB match definitely hindered his team's performance. "It 
depended on who played with the wind, but it had an adverse effect 
on our play." 

Last Friday night San Diego 
was treated to the gravely, 
sometime s melodi c perfor-
mance of Tom Waits. Appear-
ing at the California Theater, 
Waits became the animated 
charica ture of the liCe on 
Broadwa y and 3rd . Every 
move carefully tuned to the 
music, the dirty black suit, 
loose tie a nd baggy pants 
imitated a style far from the 
day to day existen ce most 
UCSD students li v e . For 
example, " see a red head in a 
uniform will always get you 
horny with her hairnet and 
those white shoes and a name 
tag and a hat. she drove like 
Andy Granatelli and knew how 
to fix a flat," from " Jack & 
Neal" on the Foreign Affairs 
LP. 

Waits' style. criticized by 
some as too raspy and degen-
erate, drew a large crowd that 
cheered him on to three 
encores . It appears that 
through years of effort Waits is 
finally being acclaimed for his 
talent and twisted humor. ' 'I'd 
rather have a bottle in front of 
me than a frontal lobotomy." 
What more can you say?

Bakke ••• 
(Continued from pale 1) 

Thomas, who is the president 
of the San Diego Chapter of the 
NAACP, said, "The Bakke case 
is symptomatic of where the 
univel'sity is in terms of its 
commitment to equal oppor-
tunity policies. UCSD's position 
doesn't seem to be toward equal 
opportunity, but toward 
maintaining the status quo." 

Affirmative action policy is 
reflected by those who make 
the decisiQns, said Thomas, 
pointing out that there is not one 
black person at the administra-

tive cabinet level or above. 
Cae IrreIevan& 

"The case is irrelevant to the 
kind of mood' that has been 
created across the nation, a 
definitive anti·black mood. It (the case) is relatively 
unimportant to what happens to 
black people in this country," 
said Thomas. 

• 'It brings out the worst of the 
misunderstandini ab'out 
affirmative action," said Del 
Drago." It takes the focus away 
from what affirmative action 
really is. It is opening oppor-
tunities and not locking out any 
particular constituency. 
Affirmative action has a totally 

Frtder. Febru8Iy 24.1171 

positive attitude rather than a 
negative attitUde." 

Del Drago didn't see the case 
al having any actual effect on 
the affirmative action program 
at UCSD. She pointed out" that 
the Davis program was 
"simplistic and not the best 
way to implement affirmative 
action. Affirmative action 
doesn't mean quotas; they 
defeat affirmative action." 

Del Drago echoed the feeling 
of Byrd that Bakke would have 
had no case against the UCSD 
affirmative action program. 

Saccharin ••• 
(Continued from page I) 

Brown pointed out that the 
life span of an experimental 
animal is much shorter than 
that of humans. The animal 
could die of something else 

4~~~~:'J~J!.!~!..~~~~~J!~~i' before it contacts cancer. Some carcinogens take 20 to 30 years before they affect humans. AdditionaUy, the possibility of 
l.~. some carcinogens causing 

To~lghtl 7:00.1:30 pm

cancer is one in 1,000 (such as 
the number of people over 40 
that will develop luni cancer) . 

Saccharin is considered a 
carcinogen by the FDA. 
Anything that is considered a 
carcinogen, no matter how 
mild, the FDA will ban a~cordi!lg to the symposium 
diSCUSSion. The FDA is actilll 
under the law of the Delaney 
Amendment, which explicity 
states that "no additive shall be 
deemed safe if it is found to 
induce cancer when indigested 
by man or animal or if it is 
found after appropriate testing 
to cause cancer in man in 
animaL" 

Alternatives brought forth at 
the symposium were for 
saccharin and other mild 
carcinogens to be kept on the 
market as a perscription drug 
or to label the chemical 
advising the consumer of it's 
potential harm.
