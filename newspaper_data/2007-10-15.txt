Warren Council Puts 
Fee Hike to Student Vote

Council Discovers Loads of Leftover Budget Cash

By Sonia Minden
Associate News Editor

The prevalence of campus construc-
tion may excite many UCSD shoppers 
and scholars, but for small businesses 
like the Food Co-op, the tangle of cau-
tion tape is a reminder of last year’s 
unresolved problems. Lack of reim-
bursement for interrupted facilities, as 
well as an abandoned satellite location 
in Price Center, are the root of ongoing 
financial setbacks for the student-run 
store.

The co-op, a nonprofit specializing 
in healthy meal options, is familiar with 
problems stemming from the construc-
tion surrounding its locale in Student 
Center. Last year, the co-op saw its foot 
traffic lowered, store space reduced and 
— from January through April 2007 
— kitchen access severed. Perhaps most 
grating to employees, though, was their 
intermittent loss of access to water.

According to section seven of the 
Retail Cooperative Space Agreement, 
temporary loss of water supply would 
necessitate rent relief for the co-op. 
In spite of this written compensation 
guarantee, University Centers Director 
Paul Terzino countered that adminis-

trators had provided the requisite 30 
days’ notice of facility interruptions. 
Terzino further claimed that section 
seven only applies when such interrup-
tions force a tenant to close. 

Although the co-op remained open 
and functioning in the face of facil-
ity difficulties, university administra-
tors ultimately offered the co-op a 50-
percent rent abatement that members 
rejected.

“We didn’t accept [the partial rent 
abatement] because we wanted to pur-
sue full rent abatement for the period 
of time that our kitchen was under 
construction, which we believe is owed 
to us based on the language in our 
space agreement,” John Muir College 
senior and Food Co-op employee Molly 
Parent said. “We are looking into more 
formal means of settling that dispute.”

A week ago, co-op employees 
decided to compose an official docu-
ment asking the A.S. Advocate to assist 
them in obtaining full rent compensa-
tion. Though a response has not been 
received, employees hope that the letter 
will enable them to use the coming 
A.S. Council meeting as a forum where

The Warren College Student 
Council approved a referendum to 
increase the quarterly Warren College 
Activity Fee from $4 to $7 at its Oct. 9 
meeting in the first proposed increase 
to the fee since its induction three 
years ago.

Five years ago, WCSC’s budget 
was $19,000. It is almost double that 
now, with a current total of approxi-
mately $49,200. According to Warren 
College Council Parliamentarian Dan 
Palay, the increased budget reflects the 
enhanced size and number of events 
the council sponsors, such as the third 
annual Warren Live! concert and the 
newly established Warren Transfer 
Commuter Commission. 

Warren College’s activity fee is the 
lowest out of the six UCSD colleges, 
and is one of the few that does not 
instate automatic fee adjustments to 
accommodate annual inflation. As 
such, WCSC has lost significant buy-
ing power in the past three years, Palay 
said. In addition, the A.S. Council’s 

quarterly contribution of $0.35 per 
student has been eliminated, further 
weakening council funding for existing 
programs. 

“Warren College Student Council 
is at a crossroads when it comes to 
funding,” Palay said. “The design of 
the referendum was to make sure that 
our concert, Warren Live!, would be 
self-sufficient if and when Associated 
Students decides to discontinue fund-
ing college concerts and traditional 
events.”

The Warren College Council 
Concert Commission was allocated 
$13,250 in this year’s budget, second 
only to the council’s events board, 
which was funded $14,400.

Palay’s design includes two addi-
tions to the fee referendum: First, the 
increased $3-per-quarter hike would 
recoup that loss and provide suffi-
cient revenue for the council to act 
independently of outside sources. 
Secondly, the student body would vote 
on establishing an annual automatic 
fee adjustment in accordance with the

A.S. President Marco Murillo 
announced at last week’s council 
meeting that its annual fiscal carry-
over — excess revenue from the past 
year — totaled more than $264,000, 
an unexpectedly large sum that he 
and other councilmembers suspect 
could be the result of up to a decade 
of undocumented accrual.

Every spring and summer, the 
council conducts an intensive exam-
ination of its financial records to 
determine the percentage of allo-
cated funds that are unused and, 
therefore, would carry over to the 
next academic year.

“It’s kind of a weird process,” 
A.S. Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Sarah Chang said. She 

described the tedious review consist-
ing of “tons of receipts” from student 
organizations, often for very small 
sums, and multiple Excel files that 
the council must sort through.

Murillo said the system’s accuracy 
has never been particularly impres-
sive.

“We’ve never really done a thor-
ough look at our accounts,” he said.

Facing an unprecedented influx of 
funding requests from student orga-
nizations this year, Chang teamed 
up with Murillo to help the staff dig 
deeper than usual into the accounts. 
She said  the average carry forward is 
around $80,000, but this year’s pre-
diction was actually relatively con-
servative at around $40,000. After 
hours of tallying, Chang, Murillo and 
others discovered that the rollover 
was actually over six times their pre-

diction, due to excess funds that were 
allocated primarily to A.S. adminis-
trative salaries, but also to a variety 
of student organizations and events.

Though they said the findings 
were a surprise, Chang and Murillo 
agreed that the miscalculation is at 
least partially rooted in the vacancy 
of the council’s business director posi-
tion from June 2006 to January 2007. 
They said  without a leader, more 
than a dozen financial staff members 
struggled to maintain proper orga-
nization. When new director John 
Hughes took over in January, there 
was an additional transition period 
during which Hughes had to learn 
the job’s basics as well as attempt to 
understand the figures.

Council-approved 
referendum would offset 
cuts to college funding 
and generate $26,000 for 
concerts and events.

By Jaclyn Snow
Senior Staff Writer

This year’s FallFest drew one of the biggest concert crowds 
in recent memory despite the A.S. Programming Office’s deci-
sion to make the event exclusive to UCSD students.

Attendance at the Oct. 12 concert in RIMAC Arena peaked 
at about 4,000 students when headlining act the Roots came on 
stage, according to Festivals co-Coordinator Garrett Berg. 

 Unlike past FallFests, the concert was closed to nonstudents 
to attract higher-quality acts like the Roots at more affordable 
rates, Berg said.

“The decision was somewhat out of our control,” Berg 
said. “Our deal with the Roots was that it would be an entirely 
closed-campus show so it wouldn’t affect the outside market.”

With the agreement in place, the Roots agreed to lower 
their fees and bring the act into the price range of the festival’s 
$70,000 budget. However, some students expressed frustration 
over the exclusion of nonstudents.

“I’m pissed I wasn’t allowed to bring guests,” Sixth College 
freshman Lizanne Koch said. “I called and complained to A.S. 
about this earlier, but I came anyway.”

The restrictions seemed to have little impact on attendance, 
with the Roots drawing a larger student audience this year than 
Hot Hot Heat in 2006. There was a similar-sized crowd at 2004’s 
Jimmy Eat World. However, according to Berg, Yellowcard’s 
performance in 2005 brought out more attendees.

UC Nurses Offered Higher 
Wages, Improved Benefits

University recently announced 
their proposal to the California 
Nurses Association regarding a 
new labor contract for UC nurs-
es, which includes market-based 
increases in salary as well as
health and pension benefits equiv-
alent to other university staff.

The proposal is part of an 
ongoing effort to ensure good 
wages and benefits for UC nurses 
and uninterrupted care to patients.  
The instatement of the new con-
tract is contingent on the union’s 
acceptance of the agreement by 
the end of scheduled negotiations 
on Oct. 17.

“We are offering what we 
believe to be an extremely fair 
proposal, one that recognizes the 
critical role our nurses play in 
providing outstanding care to our 
patients,” said Howard Pripas, 
executive director for UC labor 
relations, in a press release. “We 
have been bargaining in good 
faith for the past six months, and 
the time has come to conclude 
these negotiations.”

The CNA was legally barred 
by court order from conducting 
strikes against UC hospitals dur-
ing contract negotiations in 2005.    
However, the threat of striking 
cost UC medical centers approxi-
mately $9 million in emergency 
operational provisions such as 
additional staffing.

Recently, CNA has called 
strikes at several non-UC hos-
pitals in California. Negotiations 
with the union began in April 

2007.  
There are more than 8,800 

nurses in the UC medical system.  

Regents Receive $30.4M 
in Microsoft Settlement
Although Microsoft and Eolas 

Technologies Inc. refused to 
reveal the terms of their high-pro-
file patent dispute, the University 
of California’s status as a public 
entity obligated the recent dis-
closure of what it received from 
the deal.

The UC Board of Regents was 
awarded $30.4 million, UC Office 
of the President spokesman Trey 
Davis said on the Seattle Post-
Intelligencer Web site. 

Microsoft and Eolas reached 
a settlement in August. The 
University of California was 
named a plaintiff in the litigation 
because it licensed the technol-
ogy to Eolas. 

Eolas had alleged that Internet 
Explorer violated its patent for 
accessing interactive content 
on Web pages. The agreement 
resolves a case in which Microsoft 
was previously hit with a judgment 
of more than $500 million.

“The litigation with Microsoft 
has taken a great deal of man-
agement time and effort and sig-
nificant financial resources,” Mark 
C. Swords, Eolas’ chief operating 
officer, said in a letter posted on 
the Seattle P-I Web site.  “We are 
very pleased that we now can 
focus our resources on commer-
cializing our existing intellectual 
property portfolio and developing 
new fundamental technologies.”

track of our expenses during the year,” 
Murillo said.

Scholarship funds and student 
organizations could be potential 
recipients of the leftover money, 
Chang said, though she also plans to 
set aside a financial buffer to cover 
some of the costs associated with 
relocating councilmembers’ offices to 
the new Price Center expansion in 
February 2008.

Murillo said areas likely to receive 
additional funding this year are A.S. 
Safe Ride, the All-Campus Commuter 
Board, the Women’s Commission and 
Volunteer Connection. Some money 
may also go toward another Bear 
Garden event, he said. The council 
will vote on these initiatives at its Oct. 
17 meeting.

Another possible use of the funds is 
the creation of an A.S. “event coordi-
nator” position. Currently, University 
Events Office Director Martin 
Wollesen assists with council-spon-
sored events, but is often overbooked 
due to the large number of events 
— some of which occur at the same 
time. Murillo said having a dedicated 
A.S. event coordinator would enable 
the council to plan more events and 
generally expand its programs, though 
he is still working on the position’s 
specific responsibilities.

Chang agreed that the council 
should be patient with the funds and 
carry out more research before spend-
ing them.

“This is basically a once-in-a-life-
time opportunity, and we want to 
make sure we use [the surplus] for the 
students who paid for it,” she said.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2007 THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS  7

California Consumer Price Index to 
prevent future loss due to inflation. 

Since its approval by the college 
council, Warren students will have 30 
days to vote on the referendum. If 
passed, the council will have an addi-
tional $26,199 at its disposal. Palay said 
he believes this referendum will be 
sufficient to cover the cost of Warren 
College’s programs. 

“Because WCSC breaks up its 
money into three different pro-
gramming arms — Warren Live!, 
WTCC and our events board — it is 
only fair that all three of these arms 
receive an equal boost in funding,” 
Palay said.

Each of the three units would ten-
tatively receive $8,000, while the addi-
tional money would return to WCSC 
for other allocations, including Warren 
student organizations.

Palay said if the referendum fails to 
pass, then either the number of events 
or the size of those events would 
decrease, though he did not specify 
which events would be impacted.

“It’s my hope that Warren stu-
dents will see this as an opportunity 
to increase the amount of programs 
that they have and the success and 
vitality of them such as Warren Live!,” 
he said.

sharondipityi@sbcglobal.net. 

The Prayers, a small-time local 
band, opened the show to a crowd 
of 1,000. During the set, showgoers 
crowd-surfed and started mosh pits 
that continued into the next act, K23 
Orchestra.

“I like that [K23 Orchestra] were 
conscious about the world, like social 
issues,” Thurgood Marshall College 
senior Shannon Delaney said.

The band’s mix of jazz and spoken 
word was a transition between pop-
oriented Prayers and self-proclaimed 
legendary hip-hop group the Roots.

“More hip-hop artists should bring 
back that live sound,” Revelle College 
senior Daniel Borca said of the Roots. 
Berg said the Roots’ performance was a 
definite showstopper.

“Both the Prayers and the K23 
Orchestra really got the crowd going, 
and then of course came the Roots,” 
Berg said. “They are an unbelievable 
act to see live, and every last note 
had the students moving. From the 

packed floor to our own staff behind 
the scenes, everyone was having a great 
time.”

The crowds came out in full force 
for the Roots, filling RIMAC Arena’s 
floor to nearly full capacity. A sou-
saphone player and congos were on 
stage with the Roots — both new 
additions to the band’s usual lineup. 
The group’s set lasted over an hour 
and covered the spectrum of their 
catalog. Go Get a Late Pass played a 
version of Bob Dylan’s “Masters of 
War,” during which attendees held up 
lighters in reponse to the song’s anti-
war sentiment.

“The show was a huge suc-
cess,” Berg said. “We had an incred-
ible turnout despite the lack of stu-
dent guest tickets and the fact that 
we were competing with Soma’s Rilo 
Kiley show, as well as the end of 
Rush Week.”

they can publicly express and negotiate 
concerns.

Another source of frustration for 
the co-op is the failure of its satellite 
store, opened in January 2006, which 
was shut down over the summer. 
Located in Price Center, the satellite 
was an attempt to profit from the busy 
campus hub.

“It was really great for us to be able 
to communicate to a new demographic 
and customer base, so that we could 
educate them about food alternatives,” 
Parent said. 

Though the additional location was 
designed to compete with Price Center’s 
array of restaurant options, the satellite 
struggled with meeting campus inter-
est, slow summer profits and a lacking 
staff. Combined with debt from a loan 
required to open the satellite, the co-op’s 
finances were too unstable to support 

both sites.
Though the co-op expects to re-

open the satellite in the future, its 
focus has shifted to settling current 
debt and garnering more campus 
support.

“It was cool to have a presence in 
the corporate-dominated consumer-
ism of the Price Center,” Muir senior 
and co-op employee Adam Calo 
said. “However, I’m more focused on 
keeping the co-op alive. Spreading 
too thin was the reason why it had 
trouble.”

In order to do this, employees are 
looking to recruit more volunteers.

“We’re asking the community to 
become involved as more than con-
sumers, but as invested members of the 
co-op,” Calo said.

GUEST COMMENTARY 
By Michael Bakal, Grecia Lima and Dorothy Young

On Oct. 13 the California Development, Relief and Education 
for Alien Minors Act was vetoed. The hopes of thousands of high 
school students have been squashed — terminated — under the 
foot of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. But the failure to pass the 
D.R.E.A.M. Act goes beyond one person’s narrow decision. It is 
one of many consequences of our society’s lack of encouragement 
for critical analysis of the law, its prevalent, evolving racism and 
narrow views of complex social issues. 

This year, students joined together to demand a groundbreak-
ing change that would finally allow undocumented students to feel 
equal to their peers, not alienated. By demanding the passage of 
the California D.R.E.A.M. Act, students were asking for a helping 
hand. They were asking simply for the possibility of hope. The 
hope that educators, peers the government and the general public 
could come to recognize and value their academic achievements, 
and finally give them a chance. 

Undocumented students face barriers and difficulties the rest 
of us cannot even imagine. Despite these challenges, many have 
still found a way to succeed academically. By making financial aid 
available, the  D.R.E.A.M. Act would have made college a feasible 
option for these students. Furthermore, it would have done so at 
little or no cost to California taxpayers. In his op-ed article to the 
Los Angeles Times, state Sen. Gil Cedillo (D-Los Angeles) explained 
the D.R.E.A.M. Act only pertains to noncompetitive grants, so 
there would be no chance of services being diverted from citizens 
to noncitizens. In fact, the resource pool under discussion in the 
D.R.E.A.M. Act is under-utilized. Cedillo wrote on May 19 that 
“during the past two academic years, only 64 percent of allocated 
grants were awarded. Many students are not aware of the statute on 
Entitlement grants, and allotted funds go unclaimed.” Essentially, 
a large sum of money is wasted each year. It is irrational that we 
would prefer to keep this money locked up, rather than make it 
available for all deserving students.

During the D.R.E.A.M. Act campaign at UCSD, many students 
were asked the question: “Do you think students have a right to 
pursue their dreams of higher education?” There was not one 
student that answered “no” to the question. But when we would 
explain to our fellow students that the ones pursuing the dream 
were unauthorized immigrants, their expressions and even their 
answers would often change.  

What is it that makes undocumented immigrants subhuman? 
What is it that makes these specific students less than anyone else 
in this country? “They are criminals, they broke the law, they do 
not deserve to be rewarded for it,” is the commonly heard core 
of much anti-immigrant rhetoric. It is surprising how fearful of 
and devoted to the law people become when talking about illegal 
immigration. 

All of a sudden, people seem to forget that the law is not the 

Eight Rules 
That Will 

Change Your 
‘Lyfe’ Forever

All of you should feel really privi-
leged right now, because I’m about to 
let you in on eight little secrets. But 
before we get to the goods, you’re going 
to have to bear with a little back story, 
because y’all ain’t gettin’ nothin’ for 
free. And it goes like this:

About a year ago, I was abruptly 
awakened from a mid-afternoon slum-
ber to my roommate’s frantic voice 

calling, “Come here! You have to see 
this!” So, naturally, I got up to address 
the situation, and was pleasantly sur-
prised to find him watching Kelis’ 
“Bossy” video on YouTube.com. But it 
wasn’t the video that he wanted me to 
see — it was a user comment after the 
video that had caught his attention.

Some hater commented that the 
video was the stupidest thing he/she 
had ever seen in his/her life, which 
spurred a diehard gem of a fan to intel-
lectually shoot back, “Yo this video 
isn’t stupid because she’s showing that 
she’s the boss of her own lyfe.” That’s 
right, lyfe.

It was then and there that my 
roommate and I decided to separate 
life from lyfe. Life, we reasoned, should 
consist of biology tests, drive-through 
windows, crappy first dates and all the 
other daily shit that we have to deal 
with. Lyfe, on the other hand, has a 
set of painstakingly crafted (by myself 
and close friends) philosophies all its 
own, and once you’ve adopted them, 
I promise you that your life — er, lyfe 
— will never be the same. 

First rule: If they offer it, you take 
it. This rule is extremely important 
because “they” signifies anyone, just 
us “it” signifies anything: food, a ride, 
a bowl, and even obscure actions like 
washing the dishes. Remember that 
this rule is first for a reason, and it 
works in mysterious ways. Always 
accept every offer, because you never 
know when the next one will come 
around. So seize your chance, or be 
sorry.

Rule number two: When in doubt, 
pull out. This rule was initially devel-
oped as a loophole for rule number 
one — it also works in any situation. It 
might mean you say “no.” It also might 
mean you get the hell out, ASAP.

Number three: If you want it, snatch 
it. Sometimes they don’t offer it, and 
that’s when rule number three kicks in. 
If you want it badly enough, then god-
speed, comrade, only you know what 
you have to do to get it. Never rule out 
any tactics, but if you’re ever in doubt, 
refer to rule number two. 

Fourth rule: Work it. This rule 
should be self-explanatory, and works 
best when combined with any or all of 
the other philosophies, especially rule 
number three. 

Rule number five: Blame everyone 
else. Nothing is ever your fault — noth-
ing. Make sure that you do everything 
in your power to shift the blame away 
from yourself at all costs. And if some-
thing is your fault, see the next rule.

Number six: If you got a problem, 
deal with it. Any questionable situa-
tions must be handled without even 
the slightest hesitation. Preferably, you

In a simple world, the line between right and wrong is as clear as 
the difference between black and white  But, the world is not so sim-
ple and necessity forges some uncomfortable moral compromises. 

There are powerful economic and safety reasons to follow the 
speed limit, for instance — but that doesn’t mean people do it. 
Congressmen are elected on no-tax, no-spend platforms, only to find  
their local constituency’s needs justify a few pure-pork line items; and 
various affirmative action schemes attempt to counteract discrimina-
tion by discriminating. All are compromises of some basic principle, 
rationalized for the sake of the greater good.

Such a compromise was the California Development, Relief 
and Education for Alien Minors Act, which would have permitted 
undocumented students to apply for noncompetitive financial aid. 
But even if Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger had not vetoed SB 1, such a 
compromise might have proved to be one too many.

The D.R.E.A.M. Act was essentially a sister bill to 2001’s AB 540, 
which allowed undocumented residents to pay in-state tuition for 
higher education (if they meet certain requirements). That bill care-
fully skirts a 1996 federal law that prohibits offering higher education 
benefits to undocumented residents, on the basis of residence, unless 
those same benefits are available to legal residents. Because AB 540 
requires only attendance at a state school, rather than residency in 
California, the bill deftly sidesteps the restriction.

By mimicking that strategy, this year’s rewrite of the D.R.E.A.M. 
Act allows undocumented immigrants to apply for noncompetitive 
higher education benefits. In so doing, it avoids federal restrictions 
that prevent undocumented residents from competing with legal 
residents for higher education funds.

Despite the technical legality of both AB 540 and SB 1, the net 
effect of the bills is undeniable: They give funds to illegal residents 
that might otherwise be available to legal residents. The argument 
that the state has already set aside funds, as advanced in an Oct. 10 
Los Angeles Times editorial, is a polite way of dodging this fact.

Why should illegal immigrants be given the same benefits as legal 
immigrants? Why should non-taxpayers be given the same benefits 
as taxpayers? It’s difficult to argue against such positions.

Instructively, similar arguments have been lobbed by the top tax 
bracket against the lower echelons. The top 5 percent of taxpayers 
pay the lion’s share of the federal budget, yet they have proportion-
ally little sway over how that money is spent. Why should top-tier 
taxpayers be forced to support the wants of those who hardly pay 
taxes at all? Applied to taxes, this argument falls on deaf ears for one 
simple reason: It’s hard to feel too bad for someone who makes over 
$174,000 a year, no matter what percentage of the national revenue 
pool they may finance.

And this is precisely why that same argument falls on deaf ears 
when applied to immigration. The stark visual contrast between the 
suburbs of California (median annual wage: $34,000) and waterless

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 
— The UC Board of Regents finally 
did something right. After a series 
of recent blunders, from fee hikes to 
pay scandals, last month brought a 
glimmer of hope to what has been an 
embarrassing administration. 

In their Sept. 20 meeting, the 
regents finally ended a months-long 
fracas over the university’s tobacco 
company-funded research grants. 
In early January, UC Regent John 
J. Moores initiated the anti-tobac-
co policy in hope of dispelling ris-
ing concerns about the university’s 
kinship with scorned tobacco giant 
Philip Morris. But with faculty oppo-
sition to the proposal mounting uni-
versitywide, regents wisely decided 
to nix the proposed ban and promise 
more research transparency.  

The victory for faculty and stu-
dents, however, has been tarnished 
and assailed by an onslaught of nico-
tine-bashing, irrational idealists who 
claim the move will discredit the 
university’s prized reputation for 
superior research. These anti-tobac-
co parties accuse the companies of 
conducting crooked studies aimed 
at fixing results, citing such practices 
as reason for the UC system to sever 
its ties. 

However, the time for manipulat-
ing studies has come and gone for 
the tobacco industry. By now, we can 
assume the majority of Americans 
recognize the dangers associated with 
smoking, leaving little incentive for 
the industry to empty its pockets to 
reverse something that is irreversible. 

The anti-tobacco advocacy groups 
— too engrossed in the principle 
of the issue — have ultimately lost 
sight of the facts. The past decade 
has brought astounding budget cuts 
to California’s education system, and 

much of the difference is now carried 
by the state’s over-burdened students. 
As its shaky grasp of state funding 
continuously looses with each nocu-
ous blow to the education budget, 
the UC system has driven into a cor-
ner by state legislators and forced to 
explore alternative funding avenues 
for the system’s wide range of proj-
ects. Research is just one example.

Last year alone, the UC system 
drew in almost $17 million from 
23 different grants given by Philip 
Morris. It would be challenging, if 

not impossible, for the university to 
solicit that sum of money year after 
year from other sources — student 
fees aside. And it’s for this reason that 
the regents’ decision was such a cru-
cial one. Had the ban been approved, 
the board would have set a dangerous 
precedent for scrutinizing and curb-
ing private funding, a concern faculty 
members raised when the issue was 
on trial. It would have endangered 
other private companies like British 
Petroleum, which recently offered 
UC Berkeley $500 million in grant 
money for biofuel research. 

As for the university’s ability to 
maintain reputable research with  
third-party supporters, this will 
likely not be an issue. Research is 
one department where the univer-

sity has preserved an unstained track 
record. 

Take, for example, the university’s 
endeavors in nuclear research at Los 
Alamos and Lawrence Livermore 
national laboratories, both of which 
the UC system has operated for over 
60 years. Aside from public conten-
tion over the labs’ nuclear-oriented 
work, they have yet to upset the 
university’s overall academic mis-
sion. Instead, they have employed 
17,000 workers and earned a com-
bined sum of close to $4 billion 
a year — money that is needed 
especially during the current state 
budget cuts. 

So despite the activists who 
continue to bemoan the decision, 
tobacco-funded research is still the 
university’s golden ticket. In fact, 
as the threat of further education 
budget cuts grows substantially 
more bloated every passing year, 
the university would be wise to con-
tinue pursuing similar ventures with 
other private enterprises. 

Just this month, State Treasurer 
Bill Lockyer released a bill that would 
starve the university of 20 percent of 
its annual funding by eliminating all 
state financial support. Though the 
legislation’s chances of survival are 
less than slim, it highlights the dire 
condition of the UC system, which 
will no doubt force the university to 
approach funding matters in a drasti-
cally different manner in the coming 
years. 

The tobacco fiasco was just one 
example in a line of many more 
to come. Whether or not the deci-
sion was made with the foresight of 
future budget ails, it will no doubt 
be good business for the struggling 
system.  And as long as Uncle Sam 
continues cutting off the university, 
the more it will be forced to look 
elsewhere and the less it will be able 
to act on principle alone.  

“Had the ban been approved, the board would have set a dangerous precedent for 
scrutinizing and curbing 

private funding ... ”

Private Research Funding Eases Effect of Persisting Budget Woes

should figure out how to solve prob-
lems using methods that work best 
for you, but if that tactic doesn’t work, 
remember that you can always use rule 
number two as a last resort.

Rule number seven: Get money. 
Seriously, don’t ever underestimate the 
power of this philosophy. This is the 
rule that has forced me to get out of 
bed after drinking all night when I 
have work in the morning — or when 
I have to write this column.

And finally: Just do it for the story. 
Your friends will really appreciate this 
one, because stories are always enter-
taining, whether they’re hilarious, 
creepy or all-around out of control. 

And I don’t think any further explana-
tion is needed. 

So I must say thank you to the 
anonymous person who introduced 
me to the concept of lyfe. That person 
provided the necessary spark I needed 
to define what lyfe actually means on 
a deeper level. The subsequent rules 
that I’ve developed with close friends 
to govern lyfe have worked time and 
time again. 

I’m not saying that you have to 
ditch your life. I’m just saying that a 
foray into lyfe would do everyone a 
little good. 

Also, you can’t forget that lyfe has 
a different meaning for everyone. 
Although I think these philosophies 

cover  a lot of bases, they developed 
one by one over time, and I can’t 
rule out the possibility that more 
rules will be added to the list when 
appropriate. 

You can also custom-build your 
list to create a lyfe philosophy that 
suits you as an individual; take, for 
example, my friend’s mother, who is 
familiar with this list. She recently 
offered sage wisdom appropriate for 
her lyfestyle: If there are refills, buy 
small, she said. And I say go for it. Be 
the boss of your own lyfe.

There you have it. I just offered 
you eight rules that I think will ade-
quately prepare you for any new lyfe-
style. So you better take them.

shantytowns clinging to Tijuana’s hill-
sides (median annual wage: $10,000) 
takes the wind out of any abstract argu-
ment about “fairness.” It would never sit 
well that a person born in San Ysidro 
should be afforded all the benefits con-
ferred by American citizenship, while 
someone born just down the street 
should be denied those opportunities.

With a federal quota that limits the 
number of visas issued each year, visa 
applications from Mexico are back-
logged anywhere from two to 20 years, 
depending on the applicant’s family 
status. No one with a heart can blame 
would-be immigrants from circum-
venting that hurdle, and no one with a 
brain can argue that they wouldn’t try 
the same were the situation reversed.

But in this case, empathy can lead us 
astray. One cannot appeal to the notion 
that we are all the same while simulta-
neously requesting special treatment. 
Supporters of the D.R.E.A.M. Act and 
similar legislation are compromising 
their long-term beliefs — equal oppor-
tunity for all people — for the sake of 
short-term benefits, in this case allow-
ing a small number of people to apply 
for limited financial aid. 

While the D.R.E.A.M. Act might 
have proved a godsend to the 700 or 
so UC students that would have ben-
efited from it, establishing assistance 
programs for those who have crossed 
the border illegally — and who do not 
pay income taxes — creates a festering 
resentment among those who came 
here legally and do pay income taxes.

That resentment creates an “us-
versus-them” mentality, already exac-
erbated by differences in language and 
culture and which can be seen in the 
reactions of nativist Americans and 
the counterreactions of pro-immigrant 
groups. (Browse the forums of the 
Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, for 
instance, or hunt out some non-mod-

erated forums for real eye-openers.) 
Once established, these divisions are 
almost intractable.

As long as the gulf in economic 
opportunity exists between Mexico 
and the United States, there will be 
immigration; and as long as visa quotas 
exist, there will be illegal immigration.  
No amount of concrete, barbed wire, 
or Immigration and Naturalization 
Service agents will change this. 

Any meaningful immigration 
reform must tackle one or both of these 
issues, and be addressed on the national 
stage. But by expending political capi-
tal in sympathetic border states like 
California, pro-immigration groups 
may find themselves losing larger battles 
over the forces that shape immigration. 

Want to expand the number of 
visas that can be issued in a year, a 
move that would instantly improve 
the lives of thousands of would-be 
migrants, and simultaneously encour-
age law-abiding immigration? Good 
luck getting that past a nation that is 
already embittered about financing the 
medical and primary education bills of 
illegal immigrants.

Perhaps the $1.2 billion plunked 
down (so far) for the expanded border 
fence might be more productively spent 
as an investment in Mexico’s economy, 
reducing the drive to immigrate in the 
first place? Again, fat chance. Attacking 
the fence plan last Monday, Mexican 
president Felipe Calderon argued that 
the United States and Mexico should 
be “building bridges, not fences.”

Creating an institutional double-
standard between legal citizens and 
undocumented residents is no way 
to do that. Rather than continue to 
press for ultimately minor victories like 
the D.R.E.A.M. Act, these immigrants 
should gird themselves for the national 
battles that will be more difficult — but 
ultimately more fruitful for everyone 
involved.

almighty ruler of society but that soci-
ety is the creator of the law. People 
seem to forget that for many years it 
was once illegal for women to vote. 
People seem to forget that it was illegal 
for a Chinese immigrant to become a 
U.S. citizen because they were believed 
to be “inferior.” Unquestioned com-
mitment to immoral laws has, for cen-
turies, plagued our republic. This com-
mitment to immoral laws is merely an 
evolution, a translation of the hate and 
racism that has stained our country 
for centuries. If it is not the blacks, 
it’s the immigrants or the gays or the 
women. There always seems to be a 
scapegoat on whom society blames 
its problems.

 This unquestioned commitment to 
the law allows immoral laws to prevail, 
and creates a pathway through which 
the cancers of hate and inhumanity can 
metastasize. Anti-immigration politi-
cians can’t deny higher education to 
undocumented immigrants, because 
that would categorize them as racists 
and nobody likes to be called a racist. 
So, what can they do to block illegal 

students from institutions of higher 
education. It’s as if the politicians use 
the following reasoning: “Since unau-
thorized immigrants don’t have money 
and school is expensive, let’s deny them 
financial aid! It solves all of our prob-
lems ... No one gets to call us racist and 
education remains unattainable.”

Finally, the immigration issue is a 
complex one. Immigrants do not really 
want to risk their lives at the United 
States-Mexico border, be oppressed or  
be treated with disrespect. Immigrants 
do not really want to be invisible. What 
are the incredibly strong forces that 
impel people to migrate? Millions of 
people in Latin American countries 
lie in conditions of dire poverty, due 
in large part to U.S. economic policies 
such as the Farm Bill. Illegal immi-
grants don’t risk their lives to come 
to the United States because they are 
criminals; they come to the United 
States so that they can feed their fami-
lies. 

As a society we must think about 
the social issues critically before 
we can spit out solutions. Denying 
social services to immigrants is 

not a solution; it is only inhumane. 
Denying social services creates sub-
human demographics within society 
and it propagates hate. The bigger 
person can pick on the littler one and 
the little one can always pick on the 
subhuman — in this case the illegal 
immigrant. Even if the D.R.E.A.M. 
Act were a financial burden for tax-
payers, it would still be unacceptable 
to think that education or any social 
benefit should be denied to a person 
on the basis of their immigration 
status. Society must start to think 
critically about the way it allows gov-
ernment to enact legislation. Citizens 
must start to be critical, and this 
means evaluating our laws on the 
basis of their moral merits. In the 
mean time, undocumented students 
and oppressed people all over the 
world will still dream, still fight and 
still continue to learn. The path is as 
easy or as hard as when they started 
and they will not turn back.

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK
FOCUS

By Maia Lazar
Contributing Writer

  Every Wednesday at noon, stu-
dents and faculty are drawn to 
Student Center when it smells of 
bean curry and sweet rice aromas. 
They dish out a mere $3 to taste 
religious group Hare Krishna’s 
offerings to their Lord, and wash 
down the savory meal with mint 
iced tea mixed with lemonade.

Followers of Hare Krishna, a 
religion inspired by an ancient 
mantra composed in Sanskrit, 
believe that one has an eternal 
soul, not a body, and that Krishna 
is an omniscient seed-giving holy 
deity that delivers gratitude for 
food. 

The weekly luncheon provides 

an alternative choice for vegetar-
ians on campus, in addition to 
fostering a stronger community 
spirit.

“Vegetarians get together and 
eat,” said Kevin Smith, a liaison 
for the eatery. “We offer our food 
on our altar, cooked under strict 
rules, like no tasting before it is 
offered, and distribute the bless-
ings. We call this spiritualized 
food prasadam, or mercy.”

While fans of the luncheons 
appreciate this weekly event, few 
understand why Hare Krishna fol-
lowers cook all morning to deliver 
such a delicious, yet inexpensive, 
meal.

“We are a missionary organi-
zation distributing the science of 
self-realization,” Smith said. “[And 

because] the self-soul is a servant 
of God, we are also distributing 
God realization. Our founder 
thought it was very important to 
introduce this spiritual knowledge 
available to the educated class of 
people, as there are no such cours-
es offered.  Being a Hare Krishna 
[and] recognizing my eternal posi-
tion as a servant of God is the 
most fulfilling activity in my life.”

While the usual crowd of Hare 
Krishna devotees are graduate stu-
dents and Student Center junkies, 
some are long-time fans of the 
Hare Krishna movement. Gerald 
Currinncione, a patron since 1995 
and a statistics professor at San

W ith only eight free hours every day (and most of it used to sleep), the one word that Thurgood Marshall College junior John Perry uses to describe his Birthright expe-rience is “intense.” Between going to historical Jewish 
landmarks such as Tel Aviv Beach, the Western Wall and Mount 
Masada, and socializing with his peers on camelback, the 10-day 
all-expenses paid trip to Israel is an adventure unlike any other.

 “Anyone who can do it should do it,” said Perry. “It’s a once 
in a lifetime experience.” 

The Birthright program is made available by Hillel at UCSD, 
a campus organization that encourages Jewish students to 
practice their traditional culture. Hillel offers the Birthright trip 
every winter, encouraging Jewish students ages 18 to 26 to travel 
to Israel in hopes that they will choose to continue their educa-
tion there, become Israeli residents, or simply to get in touch 
with their roots. Along with the historical aspect of the trip, 
observation of the daily life and cultural practices in Israel allows 
Jewish students to experience the country firsthand. 

 “Students judge Israel for themselves, not through televi-
sion,” said Hillel Israel Program Coordinator Diana Shafar.

While many students enjoy the historically rich aspect of 
Birthright, some tend to undergo a bit of a culture shock. 

 “Carrying a gun is totally normal,” said John Muir College 
sophomore Naomi Shiffman. “You see soldiers carrying guns in 
the cafes.” 

Although students are sometimes startled by Israel’s dif-
ferences in military presence, experiencing this aspect is an 
important step for students to understand the country’s national 
identity.

“Safety is [Israel’s] number one priority,” said Muir College 
junior Yoel Saidian.

In addition to illuminating the military’s role in Israel, the 
Birthright program immerses its participants in a daily culture 
that employs Judiaism as more than a religion, but as a way of 
life. According to Sixth College freshman Joey Axelrod, Israelis 
don’t seem to associate religion with Jewish holidays as much 
as their American counterparts, in part because of their experi-
ences with Judaism outside of religious events and services. 
Judaic holidays are observed nationally in Israel, which allows 
Israelis to partake in Jewish festivities without having to attend 
temple. 

“In Israel, everything is shut down on Yom Kippur,” said 
Shafar. “You feel [the Jewish culture] even if you don’t want to.”

During the trip, students also receive an opportunity to expe-

rience the country’s nightlife and meet local residents, further 
expanding their understanding of Israeli culture.

 “The people are cool,” said Perry. “They party, they drink … 
they’re way more laid back.”

After returning from the trip, many students said they felt 
they learned more about themselves and their link to their 
Jewish ancestry. 

“It gave me a better sense of identity seeing how other people 
saw Israel,” said Shiffman. 

In most cases, the trip can even be life changing for its 
attendees.

“The trip helped me realize who I want to be, what I want to 
do and who I want to be around,” said Saidian.

Students also maintain relationships with both the UCSD 
students and Israeli friends they met during their travels. 

 “I still keep in touch with two of the soldiers I met on the 
trip,” said Axelrod. “We made them Facebook [accounts].”

Whether students are deeply in touch with their Jewish roots 
or oblivious to the traditions of their ancestry, Birthright offers 
an opportunity to take advantage of the rich culture of their fam-
ily heritage and form long-lasting friendships with their local 
and international peers.

On the last Friday of September, my bright red spandex biking outfit left me feeling out of place, even though I had just joined 
a group of hundreds of fellow cycling enthusiasts. 
I found myself at Balboa Park’s fountain with a 
different breed of biker than I had expected. I did 
not see the old men with gray chest hair poking 
out the top of their skintight 
jerseys, nor did I see the wives 
they often tow along in small 
groups, a common sight along 
my standard route through 
Del Mar that makes me curse 
the invention of form-fitting 
fitness gear.

No, this group was young-
er and sleeker even without the aid of spandex. 
The clothes were mainly casual, and the thickest 
form of protection for many was not a helmet 
but a pair of denim jeans. As a boom box blar-

ing from the front basket of someone’s bicycle 
added to the feeling of rebelliousness in the air,  a 
man coasted up to me on his bike and handed me 

a flyer with a heading that made our mission clear: “Critical 
Mass isn’t blocking traffic      — we are traffic!”

And so began the event that takes place the last Friday 
of every month. Critical Mass, as the group ride is called, 
started in San Francisco with the goal of reclaiming the 
street from man and nature’s metal enemy: the automobile.  
For just a few hours every month, concentrated pulses of 

cyclists attain this goal in cities world-
wide as they navigate the urban terrain. 
That night in San Diego — my first 
Critical Mass — there were 400 hundred 
cyclists in attendance.

Had I known more about the event 
beforehand, I would have taken more 
steps to ensure my safety. I had forgotten 
my headlight, and was wearing clip-in 

bicycle shoes to keep my feet unfortunately fastened to 
my pedals in case I lost my balance. As the mass circled 
the fountain in the last minutes before launching into the 
streets, it became evident from the stop-and-go flow of so 
many bikes that my plan to take photographs during the

10 FOCUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2007

By Raven Bates
Staff Writer

Over the past 20 years, San Diego has been at 
the forefront of medicinal and scientific advances 
through its ever-growing high-tech and biotech 
business presence. The boom has produced over 
100,000 new jobs, a figure that increases every 
year as more math, science and engineering stu-
dents graduate and go into the industry. However, 
this flow of students will likely lessen if the num-
ber of science teachers in the elementary and 
secondary school systems continues to decline.

According to the California Department of 
Education and the California Commission on 
Teacher Credentialing, California universities are 
failing to meet the requirements for incoming 
teachers. 

In 2005, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger launched 
California Teach, an initiative aimed at increasing 
the number of teachers produced by the UC and 
CSU systems from 1,000 teachers per year to 
2,500 by the year 2010. The program allowed for 
campuses to implement a four-year plan, where 
students could graduate with both a bachelor’s 
degree and their teaching credentials. 

Even so, San Diego County reported that in 
the next five years, the amount of science and 
math teachers produced in this county alone 
would come up 400 short. Margaret Luo, a Muir 

College sophomore interested in teaching science 
attributes this decline to California’s mistreatment 
of public school teachers.

“Society no longer respects the occupation 
of teaching the way it should be respected,” Luo 
said. “Teachers are not paid well enough, they do 
not get enough benefits and they are not given 
enough time off in regards to the time they spend 
working.”

UCSD faculty and staff, inspired to enhance 
the public teacher’s profile, formed the Science 
and Math Education Program this year, providing 
an organization focused on boosting interest in 
teaching math and science. 

“The program I’m involved in … is making 
a special effort to entice UCSD undergraduates 
who are planning to major in science, math-
ematics or engineering to consider a career in 
teaching,” said John Czworkowski, a lecturer. 
“A group of staff and faculty in the Education 
Studies Program as well as departments of sci-
ence and mathematics are actively engaging 
students on campus, incoming freshman and 
transfer students. We’re also seeking financial 
and other support for students interested in 
teaching these subjects from outside sources.”

The program opened campus minors in 
mathematics education and science education, 
both consisting of 34 units of educational foun-
dations and general teaching courses for the 
respective disciplines. The minors begin with 
optional freshman seminars, one in math and 
one in science. 

“My freshman seminar acts as an introduction 
to the minor and gives an overview of a number 
of important issues in science education,” said 

Czworkowski, who offers Teaching Science: The 
Challenge.

Along with coursework, students pursuing an 
education studies minor must take two practicum 
courses, which provide them with the opportu-
nity to work with a teacher in a classroom setting 
and learn how to write a curriculum and, in 
upper-division courses, actually teach the chil-
dren with whom they work.

The program is meant to give students con-
fidence in their teaching abilities and an under-
standing of what it takes to teach effectively. 

The Science and Math Education Program 

has had more than 70 students attend its infor-
mational meetings in the first few weeks and is 
hoping to attract more as the program contin-
ues to grow. Luo was one of the first to notice 
the program, and signed up for the freshman 
seminar.

“I’m interested in teaching science because 
I am interested in changing lives,” Luo said. 
“Being a teacher is one of the few job opportuni-
ties that puts you right in the action of watching 
and helping kids grow and change. Teaching is a 
lifelong, constantly changing field that requires a 
love for kids and a love for knowledge.”

when he worked at UCSD and has 
known Smith for about 12 years. 
As a vegetarian, Currinncione was 
naturally interested. 

“People here feel a bond toward 
one another,” he said. “This is an 
alternative … people are more 
international.”

Because the low-priced food 
is popular for staff and students, 
nearby restaurants find it hard 

competition.
“We’re a non-profit, or as I joke 

sometimes, never-a-profit,” Smith 
said. “The infrastructure is already 
there at the temple so renting [a 
place to make the food] and other 
expenses are already incurred. This 
has caused other vendors to com-
plain, rightfully.”

Whether attendees of Hare 
Krishna’s Wednesday lunches are 
students looking for a cheap bite 

to eat, vegetarians honing in on a 
tasty meatless option or patrons 
fascinated by the Hare Krishna reli-
gion, they can all agree that food 
quality at that price is hard to beat.

“The food is a giant amazing 
plate that is orgasmic and the des-
serts are amazing,” Sixth College 
senior Lisa Bendelstein said. “And 
for the price, the food is healthier 
and tastier than other foods on 
campus.” 

ride might come at the price of some 
road rash.

At least I had a helmet on, so 
as a photographer I was concerned 
with more esoteric matters such as 
what aesthetics my images that night 
would take on. Shooting at night 
is tough, and so is shooting mov-
ing objects. So, to be photographing 
nighttime cyclists — while on a bicy-
cle myself — posed some interesting 
challenges. Moving bicycles started 
to disappear from my shots because 
of long exposure times.  The tech-
nique of panning the camera to fol-
low my subjects dominated my shots 
when I was off my bike, and without 
exception I used flash while spinning 
with the pack. To avoid crashing, I 
shot most frames without looking. I 
was confident something interesting 
would develop since in photography, 
chance really does favor the well-
prepared.

After circling the fountain 
enough times to get comfortable 
with my bike, my camera and the 
rest of the riders, an unseen force 
guided us away from the fountain 
and through Balboa Park. Riders 
cascaded down the steps as some 
swerved to the smooth ramps on the 
sides. The first traffic we encoun-
tered was at the beginning of El 

Prado, but it was no match for us. 
A minute later Hillcrest’s one-way 
roads were a joy. Intersections were 
a breeze, as leading riders would 
stop in front of crossing traffic so the 
whole pack could continue through 
as one. When there was oncoming 
traffic, shouts of “Stay to the right!” 
would come from the front.  At an 
intersection we passed a solitary cop 
on a motorcycle trying to keep the 
pack from obstructing traffic. There 
was some confusion at this point, 
but we continued on once everyone 
realized the cop was impotent and 
no one was in trouble.

For about an hour the pack 
cruised through Hillcrest, Mission 
Hills and Old Town until it hit the 
end of the ridge and faced a steep 
decline down through Presidio Park. 
The pack spread out, and with few 
streetlights or other riders near me, 
I was aware again that a headlight 
would have been useful. The road 
was clean, though, and so smooth I 
could barely feel it through my bike.  I 
could not even see the asphalt; it had 
dissolved into an abyss and I felt like 
I was flying. The wind dominated my 
senses. It howled in my ears and left 
me chilled despite miles of pedaling.  
Winding down the steepest slope, 
the collective effort of 400 bikers 
squeezing 800 brakes left the smell of 
burned rubber in the air.  A few felt 

no need to resist gravity and zoomed 
down the hilly road, disappearing 
around corners.  Once or twice we 
stopped amid shouts of “Regroup!” 
This afforded me the rare opportu-
nity to view the ride from a station-
ary perspective. For a few seconds 
before moving on I could watch the 
length of the group that was behind 
me, individuals known only by their 
gleaming headlights, swooping and 
crashing down a hill like a swarm of 
phosphorescent locusts.

The final stretch of the ride was on 
a bike path, which was along a corri-
dor west to the coast at the mouth 
of the San Diego River. This was the 
quiet portion of the ride, and a time 
for reflection. Sunny bike paths usu-
ally offer me peaceful relief from the 
threats of city cycling, but riding on 
the path at night left me cloaked in 
darkness and feeling outcast. I wasn’t 
afraid of vehicles any more. I wanted 
us to be back in the streets, with the 
bright signs of shops and bars help-
ing us traverse the rough city roads, 
rather than pushed out to the edge 
of the water to be forgotten.  Even 
after I split from the pack and rode 
home with just a couple friends, I 
was energized by this sensation of 
empowerment.

al championship, no win was more 
important than Friday’s rebounding 
victory in Los Angeles. Good teams 
lose; it’s a part of the game. What 
defines great teams, however, is their 
reaction to failure.

The resilient Triton squad was 
able to prove that it does deserve 
national praise by excelling in its first 
challenge after a heart-breaking loss. 
Senior midfielder Ali Lai, who scored 
the game’s lone goal, represented her 
whole team’s sentiment when she 
stressed the importance of the 1-0 
win at Los Angeles.

“Coming off of the loss to 
Dominguez it was really important to 
bounce back,” Lai said. “Losing two in a 
row would have been devastating. 

Lai said she wanted to avoid a similar 
path that the Tritons followed  in 2004 
when they didn’t make the postseason.

“As far as playoffs go, [beating 
CSULA] was even more important,” 
she said. “My freshman year we lost 
two of the last five games and didn’t 
make the playoffs.”

Starting Oct. 19 against Chico State, 
the Tritons will play all four remaining 
regular season games at home   — to 
which the team is unaccustomed. 

“We have been on the road a lot 
this year so it is just a big relief,” Lai 
said. “Hopefully we can keep drawing 
big crowds and get the support we 
need to win.”

have a good attitude, a 110 percent 
commitment and a desire to win. 
And that desire to win was there. 
We played great; it was a great team 
performance.”

Senior captain Josh Levy agreed 
that his squad handled the disap-
pointment of losing by making a 
stronger effort two nights later.

“We definitely bounced back,” 
Levy said. “We played really well 
and everyone stepped up. [Freshman 
midfielder] David Bakal’s goal was 
perfect. It was very well executed. 
[Junior goalkeeper] Peter [Akman] 
came up big and had a huge save 
toward the end.”

When asked how it felt to knock 
the top team of the CCAA South 
Division leaders out of first place, 
Holohan admitted that he hadn’t 
thought about the standings during 
the game.

“I actually don’t know where we 
are,” he said. “I haven’t been looking at 
the standings, because we have been 
just taking it one game at a time.”

With the win over the Golden 
Eagles, Akman recorded his third shut-
out of the year. Earlier in the season, 
former head coach Derek Armstrong 
said that there was not enough leader-
ship from the goaltender and back-
field. Now, however, Holohan feels 
that Akman has definitely grown into 
his position and has become more 
confident between the posts. 

“Peter was excellent,” Holohan said. 
“He did very well. He has stepped up as 
the leader. We have also talked about it 
and he’s stepped up and tried to be an 
example to the younger boys.”

Having scored a goal in each of 
their past three games after being 
held scoreless for the two matches 
before that, the Tritons finally seem 
to be reassembling their offense. 
More players have been getting 
involved offensively, as Bakal and 

freshman defender Brandon Yee 
scored the first goals of their col-
legiate careers.

Holohan attributed this recent 
offensive streak to a combination of 
execution and fortune.

“We haven’t really changed any-
thing,” Holohan said. “We’re just 
trying to get more going in the final 
third [of the season]. We’re finally 
getting a bit of luck.”

Levy added that the practices 
have really helped.

“We’re definitely scoring more,” 
he said. “We’ve been practicing 
going to the goal more and it’s final-
ly working now.” 

Ironically, all three of UCSD’s 
wins have come against higher-
ranked opponents, proving that the 
Tritons have the talent to defeat any 
team in the CCAA. Levy believes that 
the team was more psychologically 
prepared for the big games, with the 
exception being the match against 
Cal State Dominguez Hills.

“We’re stepping up against the 
bigger teams,” he said. “We get more 
pumped up. Unfortunately, against 
Dominguez, I don’t even know how 
to explain that game. It was weird 
and basically everything that could 
go wrong did go wrong. We’re capa-
ble of beating all the other teams in 
the conference.”

With four games remaining 
against conference opponents, the 
Tritons may just sneak into the play-
offs if they can be perfect for the rest 
of the season. Although the Tritons’ 
last four games are at home, the 
team will face difficult opponents, 
including Cal Poly Pomona, which 
beat UCSD 0-1 in early September.

Holohan isn’t ruling his squad 
out and remains optimistic about 
the team’s chances. 

“If we can win our last four, I 
think it might be enough to get us 
in,” Holohan said.

defensively, getting in the goal and 
blocking two five-meter penalty shots 
when Stemler was ejected. 

The game’s second half was a 
struggle for the Tritons as UC Irvine 
outscored them 8-2 at the half and 5-
1 in the fourth quarter. UCSD was not 
able to convert on its 6-on-5 offense 
and could not stop the Anteaters on 
their man-up opportunities.

Vermilyea blamed the Tritons’ 
poor second half on weak teamwork.

“In the second half we were really 
scattered and played as individuals,” 
he said. 

The Tritons struggled in back-to-
back halves as they were down early in 
their second game of the day against 
Princeton University. UCSD was not 
able to get anything going against 
Princeton in the first half, with the 
Tigers outscoring the Tritons 6-2 in the 

first two quarters.
Nature, it seems, may have been 

the Tritons’ main adversary against 
the Tigers. 

“The sun was a huge factor in the 
first half,” Garcia said. “We couldn’t see 
who we were passing to. It was the time 
of the day that the sun was setting right 
behind the cage.”

With the sun now at their backs in 
the second half, the Tritons went back 
to the style of team play that they had 
begun the day with against UC Irvine. 
UCSD opened the third quarter with 
five unanswered goals to take the lead 
in the game. 

The two teams played tightly the rest 
of the half, exchanging leads and tying 
the game on several occasions. With 
less than five minutes left, Princeton 
converted on a 6-on-5 opportunity 
to take a 9-8 lead in the game. UCSD 
answered back when Garcia hit the 

equalizer with less than three minutes 
left in the game. He also notched the 
game-winning goal with less than one 
minute left in the game. 

The win was pivotal for UCSD as 
the Tritons came from behind to avoid 
losing two games on the same day.

“We knew we needed to bounce 
back from the loss to Irvine and get a 
big win,” Vermilyea said.

Garcia had four goals in the game, 
including the tying and winning goals, 
and Donohoe added two scores for 
the Tritons. Vermilyea, Williamson, 
sophomore utility Ian Bausback and 
senior driver Ben Miller added one 
goal apiece for UCSD. 

The Tritons opened up their sec-
ond day at the Southern California 
Tournament in Irvine against Saint 
Francis College on Oct. 14 with a 
record of 10-9 and will return home to 
face UC Davis on Oct. 19.

Eagles jumped out to a command-
ing 20-15 lead after a serving ace. 
The deficit invigorated UCSD as the 
Tritons took off on a five-point run 
to tie the game at 20 apiece. Senior 
opposite Amber Ries led the attack 
with a kill and block, and the fired-
up Tritons scored 10 of the next 13 
to snatch game one 30-23. 

Down 13-5 in game two, Bailey 
began to heat up, firing four kills as 
part of the Tritons 10-1 run. The teams 
continued to trade points until UCSD’s 
new all-time digs leader senior defen-
sive specialist Natalie Facchini served 
up three aces on a Triton six-point run. 
Ries closed out game two with a kill.

In what became the back-and-
forth theme of the game, the Tritons 
again dug themselves into another 
deficit in game three. This time, 
they weren’t able to dig themselves 
out. Down 22-16, the Tritons battled 
point for point until they were only a 
point behind at 29-28. Cal State Los 
Angeles drowned UCSD’s hopes of a 
third straight comeback by winning 
30-28.

Bailey explained how the Tritons 
nearly managed to battle back from 
six points behind.

“We played in a deficit for a lot 
of the match,” Bailey said. “But for 
all the hard work we put in and our 
inner drive to win, we weren’t going 
to let up.”

The Tritons finally played with a 
lead early in game four, forcing the 
Golden Eagles into a timeout. But 
Cal State Los Angeles soared back to 
tie the game at 18, eventually captur-
ing a 20-18 advantage. The teams 
went back and forth as the conclusion 
of game four neared the end with 
neither offering any breathing room. 
Bailey tallied one of her team-high 23 
kills to tie the game at 28-28. 

UCSD would earn a 31-30 lead 
and the game point on a Golden 
Eagle error. Cal State Los Angeles 
staved off defeat with a pair of kills 
giving it game four and forcing a 
decisive game five.

The Tritons put the pressure on 
in game five, jumping to an 8-3 
lead powered by sophomore middle 
blocker Sylvia Schmidt and junior 
defensive specialist Michelle Torres. 
UCSD closed out the exciting match 
15-7, fittingly on two Bailey kills.

The Tritons’ ability to storm back 
from two games down impressed 
Black.

“We kept our poise after losing 

those first two games and came out 
with our guns blazing,” Black said. 
“I’m proud of the girls and the way 
they played tonight.”

Black also had much to be proud 
about on Oct. 13, as the Tritons steam-
rolled Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
After a slow start to game one, UCSD 
pulled away to a 22-19 and wouldn’t 
relinquish the advantage, winning 30-
26. The Tritons cruised in games two 
and three, using multiple runs to pull 
away from the Toros.

“We were serving aggressive and 
we kept building from there,” Black 
said. The aggressive serving scored 
13 aces for UCSD.

Bailey paced the team with 12 

kills and senior outside hitter Casey 
Wilson added nine.

Now in the last half of the season, 
the Tritons have learned just how 
difficult the CCAA is but are eager to 
avenge the first-half losses.

“We’re excited to see all these 
teams again,” Black said. “The girls 
really recognized the parity of this 
conference and how tough it is to 
play every match with the same 
intensity. We’re going in with the 
mindset of one match at a time and 
we did that well this week.”

UCSD will take that philosophy 
into next week’s respective home 
matches against Cal State Stanislaus 
and No. 20 Chico State on Oct. 19.

HOT CORNER

MONDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2007

By Jake Blanc
Staff Writer

The fourth best team in the nation 
is not supposed to lose. A team that 
has scored 25 goals on the season is 
not supposed to get shutout. A team 
known for immaculate defense is not 
supposed to allow a game-winning 
goal with 43 seconds left to play. But 
if all those supposed impossibilities 
do happen, that same team isn’t sup-
posed to dwell on crushing defeats, 
let it spoil their composure and keep 
them from getting back into a posi-
tion to chase down a championship.

The UCSD women’s soccer team 
went head-to-head on Oct. 10 with 
No. 25 Cal State Dominguez Hills, 
the only other nationally ranked team 
in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association. After battling hard for 
89 minutes, the Toros found the back 
of the net in the 90th minute, deal-
ing the Tritons their first loss of the 
season and dropping them to second 
place in South Conference standings 
for the first time this season. 

The losing game versus Cal State 
Dominguez Hills was the type of 
failure that could have easily derailed 
a less mature team. After a road trip 
to Northern California, the Tritons 
were looking forward to a typical 
warm San Diego night, but instead 
were met with an unusual chill that 
left players and fans alike bundled 
in sweatshirts. After not playing in 
front of a home crowd for over two 
weeks, the Tritons welcomed the 
thought of a huge throng of scream-
ing fans that would propel them to 
victory. Instead, the Triton faithful, 
although large in number, were often 
out-cheered in the stands by Cal State 
Dominguez Hills’ men’s soccer team, 
who had earlier in the night won its 
game 5-1.

Despite these innocuous intangi-
bles, the Tritons battled to the teeth for 
the whole game. With about 25 min-
utes left to play, the already electric 
game kicked into an entirely new level 
of intensity, with each team mount-
ing impressive attacks that ended 
with balls bouncing off the posts 
and keepers making one diving save 
after another. The Toros had already 
proved to be 
a formidable 
foe, having 
p r e v i o u s l y 
given the 
Tritons their 
only blemish 
on their record at the time, when the 
two teams played to a 0-0 tie earlier 
this season. All signs were pointing to 
another overtime game when, in the 
final minute, Cal State Dominguez 
Hills’ Renee Haynes netted the game-
winning goal and stunned all in 
attendance.

For the Tritons, allowing a late 
goal on their home field was a huge 
disappointment.

“It was a really hard loss,” sopho-
more midfielder Alexia Zatarain said. 
“Everybody was angry, not sad and 
down, but just angry. It did give us a 
feeling of determination though, for 
Friday’s game and for the rest of the 
season. A loss like that makes you 
want to never let something like that 
happen again.”

Head coach Brian McManus said 
the Tritons wrote their own ending.

“It was just one of those games 
that could have gone either way,” 
McManus said. “We had chances and 
we didn’t put those chances away; we 
were very naive at the end. Instead 
of putting the ball out of danger, we 
decided to play with it. You don’t 
do that with a minute and a half to 
play.”

UCSD showed its experience and 
poise by avenging Wednesday’s dev-
astating loss with a 1-0 win over Cal 
State Los Angeles on Oct. 12. For a

After a crushing 1-5 loss on 
Oct. 10 against No. 18 Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, the UCSD men’s 
soccer team responded furiously 
with an upset Cal State Los Angeles 
1-0 on Oct. 12. The impressive — 
and improbable — win improved 
the team’s record to 3-9-2 overall 
and 2-6-2 in California Collegiate 

Athletic Association play, while 
dropping South Division rival Cal 
State Los Angeles from first place.

Interim head coach Paul Holohan 
praised the 
Tritons’ abil-
ity to focus 
on the task at 
hand and put 
the embar-
rassing loss 
against Cal State Dominguez Hills 
behind them.

“[Before the Los Angeles game] 
we had discussed the Cal State  
Dominguez game, and it was just a 
letdown,” Holohan said. “We have to

After suffering a discouraging loss 
to Sonoma State on Oct. 6, the UCSD 
women’s volleyball team recovered 
with solid execution and earned two 
much-needed victories to reposition 
itself among the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association best. 

The Tritons regained their form 
after losing to the Seawolves, pull-
ing off an upset against Cal State Los 
Angeles 30-23, 30-23, 28-30, 31-33, 15-
7, and following it up with a dominant 
performance at home against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills 30-26, 30-17, 30-13. 
With the wins, UCSD improved to 13-
6 overall and 7-4 in the CCAA.

Head coach Tom Black said the 
girls were focused and ready to play 
against the No. 19 Cal State Los 
Angeles on Oct. 10 despite the loss to 
Sonoma State still lingering in their 
minds.

“[Black] persistently told us to 
move on and focus on the task on 
hand,” junior outside hitter Rebecca 
Bailey said. “We come out to every 
game focused on the task at hand 
and we work from there.”

The Tritons got off to a slow start

UCSD HAS 
TWO FACES 
IN IRVINE

The No. 13 men’s water polo team 
played like two different squads in 
its first two games of the Southern 
California Tournament at UC Irvine 
on Oct. 13, earning in a 1-1 record for 
the day.  

The Tritons played a solid first half 
of their opening game against No. 7 
UC Irvine, but fell apart in the second 
half to take a 10-5 loss. UCSD followed 
that game up with a poor first half 
against No. 16 Princeton University 
but rebounded in the second half to 
win the game by a score of 10-9. 

The Tritons came out strong in the 
first half against a tough UC Irvine 
squad. The UCSD defense, led by 
freshman goalkeeper Mark Stemler, 
held up well against the Anteaters, 
allowing only two goals in the entire 
half. 

“It was surreal,” junior driver 
Chance Vermilyea said of the team’s 
first-half play. “It was probably the 
best half we’ve had all season. We 
weren’t really thinking. We were just 
executing really well as a team.”

Sophomore two-meter Daniel 
Garcia scored three goals in the loss, 
with senior driver Curtis Williamson 
and sophomore two-meter defend-
er Steven Donohoe scoring the rest 
of the goals for UCSD. Sophomore 
utility Peter Gresham played well
