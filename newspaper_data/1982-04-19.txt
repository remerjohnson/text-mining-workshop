START HERE: follow black line 

BEGIN CAMPAIGNING 
April 20 

Start by putting up posters (8%/1 x 
11/1 or smaller) everywhere 

advertising your slate. You can put 
up some big banners, but no more 

than 50. 

VIOLATIONS 
Your opponent has cited you for 
posting handbills on cars in Muir 

parking lot. Could be trouble. Better 
think up something good for the 

election board. Lose one turn. 

DAY BEFORE ELECTIONS 
Getting nervous. Ready for last-

minute poster blitz. Remember, no 
posters on cars this time. File last of 
campaign receipts and pray you 

didn't exceed budget. 

START SPENDING 
Your slate has four people on it. You 
can spend up to $170 on campaign 

materials. Start looking for the 
cheapest Xerox place in town Don't 

forget to file Income and Expense 
Record forms. 

ENDORSEMENTS 
Start hitting up the campus 

newspaper for endorsements. The 
new indicator said it would get 
back to you. The woman at the 

Guardian just laughed. Better try the 
California Review 

FINISH HERE: thank goodness it's over 

ELECTION DAY 
There's a knot in your stomach Don't 
forget to vote for yourself. Better take 

alka seltzer. Election results are 
back. You won, maybe opponent 

asks for a recount. Send out hit 
squad. Don't forget to take down all 

posters and banners.

Editorial 

Parking fee boost 
is unfair to students 

UCSD. along with the rest 01 the UC SV, tern IS 
uffering the ill effect of a statewide financ'ial cri~is. 

It i. no wonder. then. that Gov. Jerry Brown became 
qUIte angry when Chancellor Richard Atkinson 
revealed plans for a multi-million dollar parking 
structure at University Hospital in Hillcrest. 

The studenL. too, hould be less ( han pleased with 
the plan. for they may end up financing a part of the 
con truction through increa ed parking fees. 
Admini,trators have not announced any conrete 
plans for financing the project a yet. but one propo al 
shows students, houldering a significant portion of 
the con truction co t through substantial increases 
in their parking permit fee. 

It would be wrong for students to contribute toward 
building a structure off campu for which they will 
have no direct or indirect usc. It is clearly the 
respon 'ibility of those who will use the structure -
ho pital per onnel and the public - to bear the full 
co. t of building the structure. 

We do not doubt that the parking structur is 
needed. A lengthy communication issued by UCSD 
Auxiliary Enterprises over spring break described in 
great detail the parking "crisis" at University 
Hospital. On street parking around the ho pital has 
been eliminated. Nearby parking lots have been sold 
for housing development. 

And it is disturbing that this explanatory 
document \vas distributed to "all UCSD faculty, staff 
and students" during the pring break when many 
were away from campus. We had one is ue of the 
Guardian in which to announce a series of open 
forums on the matter held during the first week - not 
nearly enough time to inform students of something 
so important. 

We recognize the problem, and we agree something 
must be done about it in order to maintain the 
integrity of medical care provided by the university. 
However, UC D students are already neck-deep in 
the mire of financial difficultie .. It would b nothing 
less than an outrage to complicate matters with a 
surcharge from which students will reap no benefits.

Big stand off over Falklands: 
Argentine's gamble may be fatal 

BY NEL ON VALDEZ 
Pacific New!' S{'r\'iC{\ 

ALBUQUERQUE. .M. 
- The ideological engine that 
launched the Argentine 
invasion of the Falkland 
Islands runs on much the 
same fuelt hat is propelling the 
Bntish war frigates toward 
those desolate islands. It is 
unbridled nationalism. with 
deep substrata of internal 
economic peSSimism and 
polit ical crisis. 

For both nations, the end 
result of the seemingly 
unswervable course toward 
confrontation could be the fall 
of the present governments 
and the rise of radically 
different political and 
economic courses. 

The represssive Argentine 
military regime that invaded 
the British·ru led islands sits 
heavily atop a nation spinning 
out of control. The growing 
political opposition factions 
united just last December 
under a common front. In late 
March and early April massive 
street demonstrations broke 
out in Buenos Aires against 
the regime's seven-year-old 
state of siege following the 

arrest of more than 2,000 
workers who demanded an end 
to t he current economic policy. 

The mounting political 
tension is an expression of 
serious social and economic 
problems. The 1981 inflation 
rate was 131 percent. the 
foreign external debt has 
reached $.30 billion ($10 billion 
more than that of Poland) and 
foreign reserves have dropped 
to $5 billion . The Argentine 
peso was depreciated 250 
percent in 1981. and there are 
an estimated two million 
workers unemployed. Salaries 
have been frozen, and the 
overall standard of I i vi ng 
declined in real income by 13.5 
p rcent in urban areas and 25 
percent in the countryside last 
year. 

Last December a new 
mihtary government was 
imposed in the hope that this 
g neral crisis could be solved. 
It now seems that the high 
com mand concluded that the 
only way to unify the country 
was to engage in a military 
adventure. Ironically . 
natiunalism has been invoked 
by a military regime that has 
been accused by the opposition 

of selling Argen tina to the 
multinational corporations. 

Argentinian authorities 
evidently assume that the 
takeo\'er of the Falklands will 
have internal political benefits 
and few costs. This, of course. 
is promi ed on the as umption 
that the British would not be 
able to react in a forceful 
mann r and in the end would 
accept the accomplished fact. 

The only real possibility at 
this point may be for the 
British to give sovereignty 
o\er the islands to Argentina. 
but arrange for leasing I hem 
back under an autonomous 
status, perhaps similar to the 
Hong Kong arrangement. The 
idea is not farfetched. It has 
been suggested previously by 
the British but rejected by the 
Argentinians. 

Unless some such accord is 
reached, both governements 
may find themselves either 
having tocommit their nation s 
to war or lose political power. 

In the end, the military 
dictatorship in Argentina may 
prove t he real loser. uch was 
the case in Greece. when that 
nation's military junta tried to 
annex Cyprus in 1974. 

Will boycotting television help it to find God? 
BY JENIFER WARREN 

Amidst the other items on 
the UCSD Guardian's Apnl 5 
opinion page was a syndicatPC! 
article on the consumer 
boycott launched recently by 
the National Coalition For 
Better TeleviSion. 

ot only did this !-,tory 
blatantly ignore the insidious 
motives behind the boycott. it 
also misled readers into 
believing the NCBTV's efforts 
will benefit women and other 
minorities. 

Anot her look at the 
Coalition is in order. 

Pi loted by t he Reverend 
Donald E. Wildmon. a Tupelo. 
Mississippi preacher. the 
NCBTV is tired of seeing 
promiscuity, profanity . 
violence and what it calls a 
ditorted view of family life on 
commercial televi ion . Its 
mem bers - a bou t 500 
religious and politically 

conservative groups - aim to 
change net work television fare 
by boycott ing compan ies who 
spon so r what they call 
"objectionable" shows. (These 
include Flamingo Road. Soap, 
It's A Living and WKRP It! 
Cinrimwlli.) 

The Coalition's opponents 
- most broadcasters. 
advertisers and others who 
suspect an intrusion on First 
Amendment rights - are 
crying "censorship" and fear a 
revival of the blacklists which 
ravaged the entertainment 
industry in the 1950s. 

The cornerstone of 
Wildmon's argument against 
commercial T.V. is that the 
net works "have carefully 
censored Christian people, 
Christian values and 
Christian cultur rIght out of 
their programs." nllke other 
frustrated or angry VleWf'rs. 
who turn off theirets or 

swallow their objections and 
keep watching. Wildmon 
turned to the marketplace as a 
source of negotiating power. 

Those who stand against 
him. many of them organized 
into Norman Lear's grouP. 
People For The American 
Way, argue the Coalition is 
seeking to impede the free 
exchange of ideas in society 
and put its moral stamp on 
what Americans can find on 
television. Th y believe the 
CBTV's tactic of "compelling 
concessions involves a 
violat ion of rights, not an 
exercise of them." 

In response to thiS. Wilmon 
assert s "t he right to boycott is 
as American as apple pie." And 
in that respect, he is correct. 

The boycott is not illegal and 
has been used extensively in 
the pat. Civil right s groups 
offended by the portrayal of 
blacks on television on Amos 

lIlld A Ildy used the boycott to 
drive that show off the air; 
Itali an Amencans had the 
right to rid television of The 
Untouchables. a show they felt 
indicated that all Italians 
belonged to the Mafia; and 
feminist groups have long 
boycotted products that 
portray women in submissive 
or housewifey roles. Striking 
at the pocketbook of those one 

seeks to persuade is clearly 
nothing new. 

What is important in this 
instance is Wildmon's goal. 
not t he means he is using to 
reach it. 

Through his special urvey 
techniques. Wildmon ha 
determined that "the 
American people overwhel· 
mingly believe in God and the

Keeping It Up 

Cosmo's secret: it's really a men's magazine 
By BRUCE MACDONALD 

First it was the cover that 
caught my eye: a stunning. 
sexy brunette with a long, 
graceful neck wearing a 
brocade-lace camisole with 
pearly ads and sequins, all 
open d to her waist. This was 
just the most recent issue of 
Cosmopolit(/J!, the magazine 
that has carved for itself an 
enviabl niche in the immen e 
and lucrative women '~ 
magazine market. 

And so I opened it up, but 
only after becoming lowly 
cognizant that lh re was aL 0 
print on the cover. It was then 
I made the discovery: Cosmo is 
really a man's magazine. 

What do I mean by that? 
imple. Men stand to profit by 

the mag's many articles and 
good information at least as 
much as the intended female 
audience. ow, I may be years 
late In coming to this 
reali7ation, but better late 
than n ver. and those guys 
still unfamiliar with its rich 
tro\'e of valuable hints ought 
to buy t he late~t issue and see 
whal I'm talking about. 

There's gold to be mined 
here. ThiS magazine is a 
compendium of how women 
think. how they feel about us. 
what t heir secret wishes and 
pet peeves are. This is a lesson 
in psychology. a primer of the 
arcane and too often 
Impenet rable psyche of 
Modern Woman. You learn to 
anticipate their wishes, adjust 

to theIr whim~ey, adapt to 
their needs. The point is this: 
if we learn through their 
maga7ine what they're 
supposed to I arn about us. we 
can adapt and appear all lhe 
better - more confident, 
prepar d for the unexpected. 
and better equipped for the 
t ribulat IOns inherent in any 
relation-;hip. 

But hold on . Yes. 1\ e heard 
the women who swear. " But 
that's 1I0t what women read . I 
wouldn't ever read Cosmo-
except that my roommate gets 
It..." And so it goes. They do 
read it. all of them. at one time 
or another. orne it titillates. 
some It shocks. No. it doesn't 
mean that all women who read 
it are "Cosmo girls" (they're 
the ones on every cover who all 
look alike and wear the ,>ame 
dress). but you can be sure that 
their interest is piqued by a 
magazine who"e presence they 
acknowledge if only by putt ing 
it down. It's just a gloss~ pulp 
magazine . the~' might thlllk. a 
holdo\ er from t hc SeX\' 
Seventie-. - but editor Helen 
Gurley Brown knows she's 
putting out something 
irresistable for u whole lot of 
women. And men. 

To Sl'C just ho\\ good It IS, 
take anv issue and "e what I 
mean. ()nc article I'm looking 
at nght no\\'. for example. 1S 
"What Makl's a 1\lan a . ) O·?" 
And here's the long hst. plalll 
as da,. of the tnch traits that 
make- a man Just -t he kind of 
male that women lose their 
sense of reality over. 

"A man is a perfect 10." say" 
t he article. "when he ... " - and 
then the hst: "lias a bOYlh 
side." Or, "lie can skip rocks 
on a lake or Imitate the sound 
of screechmg brakes ." See 
what I mean? Thi" is good 
stu ff. 

We learn to become a \0 
because we kno .... t hat he IS "0 
sensitIve that he "cnes at "ad 
movies" and "al .... ays puts 
down the toilet seat. " The 
perfect male makes "ure he "I" 
nIce to your grandmother." at 
the same time remembering 
that a gentleman "pays for 
your birth-control pJlk " 
These hints are plain common 
sense and. I think most guys 
will admit, intnnslcall v 
rewarding. We lik(' to know 
what's appr ciated 

But what are we to do \\ hen 
the criteria for a IO arc beH)Jlcl

"controversial" figures or 
actors embroiled in a scandal 
are today? The directions this 
cru ade could lake arc 
count le s. 

It is no secrel that most of 
what commercial television 
offers its viewer consists of 
' hallow themes and Ihin 
scripts masked by graphic 
violence or f1a hy ex. And it is 
hard to defend broadcasters 
who treat their audience like 
mindles sheep, automaton 
who wi ll turn on their sets no 
matter how little creativity, 
depth or intelligen ce 
characterize the shows they 
find available on a given night. 

But despite the unimpres-
sive - often nauseating -
quality of existing commercial 
programming, Wildmon 's 
alternative represe nt s a 
monolil hic point of view which 
cou ld be worse. 

The pressure the economic 
boycott may put on sponsors of 
"u nacceptab le" program s 
could effeclively muzzle 
out lets of information and 
entertai nment that. while 
perhaps "immoral" by 
Coalil ion standards, have a 
legitimate place in our society.

Afl er years of mlernal

UCSD law school 
stalled for the year 

By HENRY SCHULMAN 
Sacramento CorresJX>nde nl 

As emblymember Larry 
Kapiloff' effor t to lay the 
~roundwork for a new 
University of California law 
chool in San Diego appear 

dead this year. In a surprising 
4 ·4 vote. the As embly 
Education Committee ye ter· 
day rejected his plan for the 
University to take over the 
California Western chool of 
Law. 

The DemocratIc assembly· 
member ha long advocated 
establi hing a new publically 
funded law chool in his 
district. He has complamed 
that only one of Califorllla's 
four law schools is in :-;outhern 
Cahforn ia , where 75 percent of 
the state\ resIdents Il\e. 

The Committee dt'feated 
Kapiloff's proposal despite It" 
,t·1 approval Monda~ 10 the 

A~sembly Postsecondary 
Education' ubcommltt('e. . 

The bill recommended that 
the l C Board of Regent:-; 
accept as a gIft the buddmg 
0\\ ned by the p r I \' ate 
California We:-,tern chool. 
whIch ,vould, in t urn, lease the 
building back to the 
regents. The UC would 
~rraduaIly assume cont rol of 
the law school over 10 vears, 

u~lOg proceeds from t he ~aleof 
the building for operating 
expenses. 

The Education Committee 
rejected the plan without 
debate, arou"l0~ speculatIOn 
of the members motIves for 

rever~ing the subcommIttee's 
recommendation ource" 
:-;uggested the l egi~ lat lOn 
might offend Senator Alfred 
AlquIst, D· an joe, \\ho 
advocates closing all L'C la,,,, 
school to sa\e mone\ and 
reduce the number of la'w\ers 
in Califorl1la . 

Kapiloff's bill would ha\e 
e\entually requIred apprr)\al 
of the Senate F'inance 
Committee, whIch AlqUIst 

chairs. 
UC lobbyist Lowell Paige 

aid the University, which 
took a neutral position on the 
legi lation, i constitutionally 
allowed to use Kapi loff's plan 
without legislative approval. 

A special UC 0 committee 
is discussing alternatives for 
opening a law school. The 
report will be submitted to 
Chancellor Richard Atkinson 
and t he regents. 

Kapil o ff' s bill is sti ll 
technicallv alive, but it s 
approva l depends upon a rare 
:,pecial meeting of the 
committee. Frida\ is the 
deadline for fiscall\'· rclated 
bill" to pa"~ theIr ' origInal 
comm ittees thIS se..,SHm, and 
the committee is not ~cheduled 
to reCOl1\'ene unl1l :'.1ondav. 

T est I h ' i n g be for e 't he 
~ubc()mmlltl'l' \! onda\, 
Kapdoff called hI" "ugge~lI(~n 
"a onet ime opport unit~· to put

Hunt Ington Beach . which 
would have prohibited use of 
mandatory student registra· 
tion fees for "political 
activit ies," including studen t 
lobbying and support for

The thrills continue for the softball team 
BY JOE FA LLETTA 

Senior S taff Writer 
The Triton softball team 

did it again in classic form, 
u ing guts, -pirit and talent to 
pull one away from the 
University of Redland s 
Thursday, 3-2. 

This time it was a duel of 
two arms, a UCSD's Jill 
K ne allowed no hits and 
faced two more than the 
!1linimum through the fir~t six 
InnIngs. 

The Redlands pitcher 
allowed only one hit, facing 17 
bailers in t he first five frames. 

LTC went ahead in the home 
sixth. howe\er, garnering two 
runs on a hit bv Karen White. 
two Redlands errors. a 
sacri fice flv and anot her 
perfect bunt by speedster 
Valarie Hardie. Hardie was 
standing on first by the time 
Redlands fielded the ba 11 and 
held White at third. 

Redlands' bats rame alive 
t he following inning. as Keene 
gave up two runs on t\\() 
dou bles and two singles. The 
rail\" died, however, \\ hen 
catcher Vane~sa Dans blocked 
the plate and got the runner 

coming down from third on a 
buntbacktothemound.K ne 
then induced t he next batterLo 
fly out to Cathy Clasby in 
cen ter. 

In t he home sevent h, Jan 
Mart in led off with a sin,gle to 
left and stretched it to two 
ba es on sheer guts and a head 
first dive that would ha\'e put 
Pete Rose to envy. The play 
stu nned Martin and broke her 
glasses in half. but she stayed 
in. advancing to third on a 
sacrifice bunt by julie 
• pat a fore . 

Cec Chisholm bunted out to 
the pitcher and then. with t\\"o 
out and a 2·2 count on White. 
Redlands \\" ild · pitched the 
\\ Inl11ng run home. 

Coach Dan Monteverde, to 
put it simpl\'. was ecstatic, "In 
two years I haven't seen jan 
Mart in playa bet ter game." he 
said, Calling the contest the 
most e}"clting game he had 
"een this season. he ~ald "We 
needed somet hmg like thi s." 

The Tritons play five more 
games this ~eason incudmg 
t \\"() more at Warren Field, 
again..,t Cal Lutheran April 30 

and again~t Whittier College 
Ma\' I, 

\Vh i Ie Monte\ erde wou'ld 
nOI be pinned to a "big finish" 
slatement concerning the 
Tritons' next fivegames. there 
is somet hing magical about 
play in these last few games. 
Call it the"medium mix!ureof 
talent and heart." as 
\1onteverde did following the 
win against Loyola Mary· 
mount. or don't Irv at all to 
label il.theTritonsarecoming 
up "Ith the dutch hih . 
saCrIfices and fielding g ms, 
Fielding error" are fewer and 
t he Tritons are playing a 
tighter brand of so ft ball. 

lI ardie has come up wit h 
",Ol11e fine running catche" in 
left field and Chisholm is 
handling third base with the 
al-,rilit y of a Brooks ~{)binson . 

Leigh Ann Layton IS giving 
runners second thought " 
about t rving to score from 
Ihird on a fly ball to right and 
Dtl\I"'. on tlnything t htlt n .. n't 
hit. 

The bl:nrh i~ e\ er a big pan 
of the effort a.., Jm rw COltrell 
keeps up the enci)u ragemen t 

~DANSI(IN

,. ~ 

even when the field and the 
stands quiet down. 

Cotlrell. who somehow 
found herself renamed 
COltocell in recent Cuardiall 
arl ieles (gel those cue cards up 
a little higher, g'.II1g) says the 
leg injury seems to be 
recovering. ''I'm tough," she 
said when tlsked if she mlghl 
be in t he Ii neu p before I he end 
of the season. 

Trilon bats are also coming 

alive, Martin has colleci ed 
four hits in t he last two horne 
games. and lI ardie has become 
a bunting wizard. beating out 
plays t hat in ot her cases wou Id 
have been good stlcrifices. 

Whatever Keene is doing on 
the mound, she keeps jusl 
about ('\'erything in t he infield . 

So label it or not. if l C ' [)

and iJollle il . the\' eould retire

Padres sweep Dodger series 
Padres 4. Dodgers O. Those are not I'UIIS,t hose arel{{lmes. Stln

Los Angeles in straight sets 2-0, 8·3. ~.:~, and 9·3 unday

The series wa!-o "meaningless" if you talked to Tommy

The four victories gave I he Padres a 6·~ record. They are alone
