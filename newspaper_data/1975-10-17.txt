Bookstore Raise 8 Management Questions City Council Candidates 
Speak on Range of Issues by Cathy Fitzmaurice 

Starr Writer 

If a student buys all the books 
required during a typical year, 
and if he spends an average of 
$20 for each class, he will spend 
around $240, not including 
other school up plies. 

Because of the amount of 
money each student puts into 
the bookstore, there has been 
orne talk of students assuming 

owner hip and direct control of 
the daily operations. 

Presently the UC Regents 
own the store. Paul Mares 
manages the store and is directly 
reponsible to the Manager of 
Bu iness Services and Enter-
prises, Laura Michetti. 

A major complaint some 
tudent have is the price of 

books. Could prices be lowered 
if the students took over? 

At pre ent most textbooks are 
bought from publishers at a 
200/0 discount and are sold at 
the suggested retail price. The 
di counts on non-textbooks 
vary. 

Tho e of Random House, 
Ifred A. Knopf, and Pantheon 

Book se ll at a discount of 40% , 
if more than ten are bought. 
Mares claims that the di count 
on the textbooks is barely 
enough to cover handling costs. 

Small Price Differential 
Used books are not a great 

part of the total volume. These 
books are bought from students 
and used book warehouses at 
50% of the retail price and sold 
at 750/ •. When asked why there 

werc~ not more used books, 
Mare said that not all that they 
do have are sold, mainly due to 
the small trice differential 
between use aod new books. 
The other merchandise in the 
store i needed to make up the 
store's profits. 

In the year 1973 - 1974 the 
store's net inco~e was S33,898; 
2.5% of the total sales of 
$1,352,997. In 1972- 1973 it was 
$46,392; 4.4'1, of $1,061,830. 
The store is legally non-profit in 
that none' of the net income goes 
into private hands. Instead, it 
goes back into the store, par-
ticularly into paying back loans 
to the Regents and enlarging the 
stock and store space. At the 
end of 1974 there was still a 
$241,800 debt. 

The building comes to the 
store rent-free. Store 
renovations done this ~st 
ummer cost in the neIgh-

borhood of $30,000. In the year 
1973- 1974, $74,337 was spent 
in improving the building. 
Contrary to rumors, no plans 
are being made to move the 
tore, though the idea of 

moving to the Student Center 
was discu sed last year. 

When asked what he thought 
would happen if the students 
took over ownership, the' 
manager said that it would 

cau e little change in format. 
The economic situation would 
still stand; there would be the 
debt to pay, the professional 
staff to hire and publishers' 
prices to deal with . 

When asked what he thought 
of st udents gaining control of 
the bookstore, the Chairman of 
the Book store Advi sory 
Committee, Dr. E. Reissner 

A student member of the 
Bookstore Advi sory Com-
mittee, Steven Colman was 
much in favor of the idea of a 
tudent-owned store: "The 
tore should erve the people 

who use it, student upply a 
large part of the store's revenue 
but have no input as to how it i 
run. " 

Ownership could be tran-

books hal caused lome to alk questionl. 
questioned if students would 
have the time or expertise to run 
an institution as large a the 
tore. Rei ssne r said that 

students come to school to 
tudy, and would not be able to 

put all of their time into making 
the major decisions needed by 
the store.

sferred by the tudents 
assuming the pre ent debt of the 
tore, and borrowing from the 

Regents, then giving back to the 
Regents, what the store has paid 
them so far. 

Colman stated the loans 
could be paid out of the store's 
income.

Meeting at M uirlands Junior 
High in La Jolla Tuesday Night, 
all eight candidates for the San 
Diego City Council spoke 
before the La Jolla Town 
council on a wide range of 
i sues including taxes, growth, 
unemployment , crime and 
Black's Beach . 

John Flower , a candidate for 
councilman in District Eight 
stated that he opposes moving 
the airport to Otay Mesa. He 
said 90% of airplane flights are 
taken by 10% of the population 
and that 10% lives in the 
northern part of the city. 

Flowers said, speaking on 
high taxes, "The average 
middle-income family in the 
United States now pays about 
one-third of its income in 
federal, state, and local taxes. 
Thi is much too high! The total 
level of taxation hould be 
reduced to not more than 
twenty-five percent. 

"We can do thi by better 
efficiency, eliminating 
dupl ication in government 
services, and making sure that 
everyone pays a fair share of the 
cost'of government," he said. 

Flowers' opponent, member 
Jess Haro. said. "The number 

Scripps Researcher Dies in Antarctic Crash 
A Scripps Institution of 

Oceanography graduate 
student, Jeffrey Donald Rude, 
26, of Del Mar, was killed 
October 11 in Antarctica when a 
tracked vehicle he was driving, 
with three other persons 
aboard, crashed through the ice 
and sank in 500 meters of water. 

The other three, including 
Daniel Watson, 27, of 
Castroville, a Scripps staff 
research associate, were unhurt. 

Rude received his M S de~ree 
in oceanography from Scnpps 
in 1974 and was workin$ toward 
his doctorate, specia!Jzing in 
biological oceanography. 

Rude was a member of a 
group working at Scripps with 
Dr. Paul Dayton, assistant 
professor of oceanography. 

Dayton is studying Antarctic 
sea floor life under a National 
Science Foundation (NSF) 
Office of Polar Programs grant, 
investigating deep-sea fauna. 

Rude and Watson had been 
working for several weeks at 
McMurdo Station, on 
McMurdo Sound, Ross Island. 
Dayton left San Diego last week 
to join them and arrived in 
Christchurch, New Zealand, a 
few hours after the accident. 

At the time of the accident, 
Rude and Watson are ac-
companying two Univer ity . of 
Minnesota (UM) sentor 
graduate students, Douglas De 
Master and Richard Huemp-
fner .. both of Minneapolis, to 
. elect diving site for D~yton' 
work and also to locate site on 

which to erect warming huts for 
the observation of seals in a 
UM-NSF program. 

Rude IS survived by his 
mot her and sis ter ,. \ 

Jeffrey Rude, 
Antarctic accident 

victim of 

one issue facing the city of , an 
Diego today are taxes, the cost 
of government." Haro said that 
we mu t in titute a program 
that will help to increase the 
productivi ty of ci ty gQvern-
men!. 

Ray Lu a, r un ni ng in 
District Si, talked mainly 
about the rapid increase of 
crimes in San Diego. 

"Burglaries have increased 
23 .8% in the last year and there 
are a lot of things we can do 
about it. " Lussa went on to 
explain a pilot program in 
wh ich policemen go door to 
door tell ing people how to 
protect thei r homes. This 
program was taken to the San 
Carlos area and reduced 
burglar ic!s 37% . 

Tom Gade, Lu\sa' opponent 
tared that he' oppo ed to 

Black 's Beach. Speaking on 
unemployment he said, " I think 
we've got to find jobs for 
people wh o are ready, willing, 
and able to work. I think it' 
bad to have people who \\ant to 
work and can't find a job." 

Jesse Albritten, a candidate 
for coun ilman in the 4th 
Di trict stated, " I do belteve in 
limited government , limited 
taxe and limited spending." 

Incumbent Len William of 
the 4th Di tri ct staled, "Sur-
vival is dependent upon the 
growth of urban area . I th ink 
the thing has been called 
"Growth no Growth" here in 
San Diego. It reaUy i n' t 
"Growth no Growth". It really 
i are we going to have a kind of 
growth wh ich stretches over the 
countryside and increases taxes 
and make II Impo Sible for us 
to pay our bills, or are we going 
to have a type of growth which 
i contained within the sensible 
geographic area which we can 
provide appropriate and 
municipal services." 

The next speaker, Lou 
Ridgeway, running for 
councilman in the 2nd District 
stated that he opposes a strong 
mayor system . Instead he favors 
"a strong council who votes 
convictions, resulting from 
research, public input, and 
attendance at meetings, " He 
also opposes public nudity on 
Black' Beach. 

Ridgeway also referred to 
Maureen O'Connor's at -
tendance record on the city 
council. Ridgeway claims her 
attendance has been poor. 

O'Connor, the incumbent in 
District 2 stated, "Four years 
ago I stook before you and 
made no promises other than to 
bring to the City Council an 
open mind, an independent 
spirit, and above all, an in-
tellectual and per onal honestv 
that I believe all CItizens hould 
expect from public official!.: , 

Sisco Rubs Elbows with GSu, Handles UCSD Money 
by Ran Anbar 
Staff Writer 

Whether he likes it or not, UC San Die~o's Bernard Si co always seems to find 
hi m. elf In the midst of controversy or trying to olve problem. These privilege 
come with the job of vice-chancellor for administration. 

Sisco is in charge of virtually all non-academic matters at UCSD. This include 
business and financial management of the university, as well as overseeing the 
ho. pllal and clinics. 

At present Sisco finds himself rubbing elbows with the Graduate Student Union. 
To the GSU claim that the administration is not doing enough to solve the 

problem, Sisco replies, "We are using every resource we can imagine (to solve the 
problem.)" 

He al 0 disagrees with the GSU claim concerning the high admini tration costs 
at .U<;:SD. The GSU report compares UC Irvine's administration to the UCSD's 
pOlntlOg to .the fact that the student body population is similar on both campu es. 

SISCO POlOtS out th~ UCI is not supporting a hospital or an institution of 
ceanography. UCSD IS more research oriented that UCI, according to Sisco, and 

I IllS entails higher adminIstrative costs. 
A~untl~ to I,teaent Aaend. 

A. v~ce-cha.ncellor admmlstr~lIon, SISCO finds himself on top of the non-
a~ademlc section of UCSD. Vice-chancellor for financial man~ement H. D.

Ad mlOl'itrallve Data System, and Capital Budget, to the Operattng Budget and the

The hard part of the job i not the organization of the y tern but rather the

How Much Money to Expect 

One of the ea ler day of the year i the one when the Governor of alifornla 
signs the UC budget bill and SI co flOally know how much money to e pect from 
the state. 

This day of igning culminate many month of work. The UCSD budget 
wa ubmltted to 'Pre ident a on for review and then had to be approved by the 
Regents. 

The whole UC budget i then given to the Governor for a fir t apprai al. After 
he . uggest change, he pa e it on to the tate legi lature. 

After being kicked around the legi lature the bill come ba k to t 1e governor ' 
offtce, where it is rein pected and ometime reduced in part. 

SI co i aloin charge of helplOg the faculty receive federal re ear h grant and

ret urning t udent. . "Sometime the la 1 day of cia e i a nice feeling too," he 
added. 



Pqetwo 

as Bunk 
Harold Urey, of finest, has decided that ; 

astrology is no good. 
Further, he has de ided II is no good for the black woman In 

Wails with six childr'!n he cannot feed and who knew long ago 
that neither God nor the Department of Health would help her take 
care of them. 

Of cour e, even the daily Sidney Omar in the Harold Examiner 
Iher hu band bring home after looking for work all day will lose its 
meaning, because advice like "Careful management of your 
financial affairs i es entlal today" doesn't suit her needs much. 

Or take the man in Thousand Oaks, for whom all sense of 
spmtuality and guidance ned the day he was graduated into a life 
Ihat would be an uphill hattie for 35 years to keep himself and his 
family financially, if not'psychologically solvent. For this fellow . 
says Dr. Urey, a glance at Scorpio 10 learn that he ought to be 
careful driving on the freeway increa es hi rehance on an 
Imaginary crutch, for which there exist none of the solid sC ientific 
proof Dr. Urey approves of. 

In an article in the EnCinitas Coasl Dispalch , it wa indicated 
that Urey clutched at a table, saying it exerted more gravallonal 
force on him than the star. to which astrologlsts attribute so much 
power. 

I agree. I'm sure it exerts a whole lot more force, because if Dr. 
Urey came In one day and found 11 hanging from the ceiling, he 
would probably go completely out of his mind. 

Any of us would. Urey Hall wi ll never go away, unless an 
earthquake or an atom bomb (the SCientific validity of each is clear) 
Inlervenes. 

No scientific proof. 
Well, although they've found the ark and the shroud, they 

haven't plotted the quantity 'God ' on graph paper yet. But 185 
~ele ntl ts didn't flOd themselves condemning the people who roll 
out of bed mutterin g Corinthian II and who drive carefully on the 
freeway because It IS generally held, In Chn tianlty, that one acts 
charitably. And does not wreak havoc with one's car on the road. 

And my grandmother, who has been through as much as anyone 
and With the help of a god rather than a strip of IItmu paper and an 
H P 65, would not understand that word 'charlatan' I f II was used 
to define her minister. 

There IS much that I unexplained: people bend poons, read 
minds and endure the Humanitle seq uence. 

So why a t rology? 
The cientists may have objected becau e astrology is an i(1-

dustry, feeding off of our ignorance in order to become 
millionaires by deSigning tar charts and predicting the assasmation 
of8residents. f cour e, religion has wielded some economic clout in its day-· 
11 has won and lost electIOn, for instance, and In Spam and 
England it ha. been known 10 kick ass. 

\<; Dr. Urey worried, then, that people will become 100 relia nt ? 
That an important diplomat will change his bargainmg strategy 
accord 109 to hiS astrological forca st In the morning paper? 

Does Dr . Urey thlOk such a man would ever become an Im-
portant diplomat? 

Does the New York Times run ast rology? 
Would he object If we just allowed astrology to run 10 the af-

lernoon papers, so It wouldn't rUin anyone' day? 
And let u not forget the track record of The Rational : 
Will a moving object 111 a vacuum, when force IS no longer ap-

plied, stop? 
Does the universe revolve around the earth? 
Yes, I know. They didn't have the technology then, scie nce IS an 

evolutionary thing. So now we have a phYSICS based on the quare 
root of - J. 

They laid me, in high school, I couldn't do that. 
I gues they were wrong . I am told that such a quantity explains 

a whole set of effects that cannot be explained otherWIse. 
Reminds me of the models of the 'universe' and all the supports 

and nngs and archangels Ihey needed to explaIn the reaso n Mars

Sports Notebook

Sports editor 

The Pro Scene 
In the San Diego pro eene ... 
Bill Walton, who has been 

linked to everything from Patty 
Hear. t to vegetables, walked 
out on the noor with his long 
red hair m a ponytail, a flowing 
red beard and sideburns, and a 
bright green headband, and led 
Ihe NBA Portland Trailblazers 
to a 98-85 Win over the ABA 

an Diego Sails Wedne day 
night. 

A crowd of about 3000 
,howed up, mlssmg the fmal 
IIlll lngs of the 'Yorld Series, and 
was content with screaming at 
Walton, who went to Helix 
High In local La Mesa, and lhen 
UC LA.

He was booed regularly for casualiy walking down the court 
be llind the other players, and seemingly not playmg offenSively at 
fu ll speed. He totaled only SIX POints. Walton was, however quite 
effective defenSively, also blocking some hots and puillng 'down 
re bounds . 

A n?torlous nO!l·conformist , Walton was seen doing things a 
litt le differently , Slttmg on the scorers table during time-outs, and 
~ Illi ng on the bench when the other players where out on the floor 
~hoollng. Walton has added about 45 pounds to his 6'11" frame 
now welghl~g 250, and looked as s trong, at least defenSively, as he 
did dUring hiS day with John Wooden . 

As for the Sails, it was their f,r st exhiblllon battle and it looked 
It. 19 year old rookie forward Mark Olberding ~nd star center 
Caldwell Jones were impreS!!lve, giving the team ~me hope for the 
regular season. The Salls Will playa few more exhibition games on 
Ihe road, then open the regular season a week from Friday agalilst 
DaVid Thompson, Dan Issei, and the Denver Nuggets .... 

For some reason, opponent can only say I1Ice things about the 
wmles Chargers. After the Rams beat San Diego 13- 10 Sunday 
Lo Angeles player spoke at length about how wonderful the 
Chargers were. Quarterback James Hams: "They played us tough 
all day. We ~new ther were good, but they were even beller than 

\~e expected. Running back Lawrence McCutcheon: " Boy! 
~hey sure were fired up for us!" All-Pro tackle Merlm Olsen: 

They have fine personnel. They're gonna win alot of games thi 
year. " 

UCSD students will get a chance for two free tickets to see Julius

be printed m "!ext Wednesda~ s Triton Times, with the winner 
la klllg the t',"o tickets for the Sail -Nets game .... 

Last year s San Diego play-off team, the Mariners, are ready to 
go again. H~aded by one of hockey's most exciting performers, 

ndre LacrOIX, the Manners host Bobby Hull's Winnipeg Jet

A tilly girl walked up to Portland guard Greg Lee before 
Wedn~sday's game, handed him a piece of paper and a pencil, and 
'aid, Here Mr. Petne (meaOlng Geoff Petne another Portland

Fassbinder's 'Four Seasons': 
Not to be Missed 

"The Merchant of Four ea 'on" 
"riflen and Directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder 

By teve E 'Medina 
Staff Writer 

Grant Johannesen will be the 
featured soloi t with the La 
Jolla Chamber Orchestra 
tonight and tomorrow nigh~ ~t 8 
in Sherwood Hall. In addItIon 
to Johannesen' s performance of 
J.S . Bach's "F minor Con-
certo" and Mozart's "Concerto 
No . 24 in C minor, K. 491," 
Mu ic Director Peter Eros will 
conduct the orche tra in 
Stravinsky's "Danses Con-
. ertante " and Haydn' " 
'Mercury'Symphony." 

Saturday will find Uriah 
Heep performing in the Golden 
Hall of the Community 
Concourse. The group first 
came into public prominence in 
1970 when they released "Very 
'evy Very ' umble." Their latest 
relea e is "Wonderworld." 
Composed of Ken Hensley, 
John Welton, Lee Kerslake and 
Mick Box , Uriah Heep will 
perform at 7:30. 

Sunday night, popular R & B 
recording arti t Harold Melvin 
and the Blue Note will appear 
at the Community Concour e, 
at the Golden Hall Auditorium. 

Rainer Werner Fa binder's " The Merchant Of Four eason" 
will be pre ented tomorrow at 7 and 10 pm in the Mandevill e 
audi torium. As far a . I know, thi i the film' area premier, aside 
from elect appearances in Mann Farber' film cia . This i a 
unique opportunity that should not be pa cd up, becau e "The 
Merchant Of Four ea on " I. a preCIse, VICIOU , and outraged 
movie that hould be een by anyone who is intere ted in the 
de elopment of film art . 

At 29 Fas binder has oeen recognized by critics such as Farber 
and Roger Green pun a the prime figure in the New Germany 
Cinema. Andrew Sarri has gone so far as to call him "the most 
important new director of the la t decade ." 

The concert will begin at 7 
p.m . and will feature the group 
doing many of their well known 
hits, such as " Bad Luck" and 
" HopI' that We'll Be Together 
Soon." 

Jose Feliciano (top), (_rile liell ... Uriah Heep are all slated 
for concerts in the San Diego ..... this w .. kend. 

Fa sbinder is definitely one of the mo t prolific film makers of 
any decade. In 1972 when "The Merchant Of Four Sea on " wa 
relea ed, he had completed II film in Ie s than six year. Since 
t hen he ha made at least six mo re. He deserves the same plaudits 
awarded to pantheon dictator like Antonioni, Bergman, and 
Bre on becau e his work is every bit as complex and ri!?id . 

Every move of " The Merchant Of Four Sea on "1 rigorous ly 
plott ed. Fas binder' directional de ign leave no room for im-
provi ation or impromptu sleights-of-hand. Like his other major 
film, " Why Does Herr H . Run Amok" and "Fear Eat The Soul 
All," "Merchant" is so deliberately posed and paced that some of 
Fassblnder's detractor have labeled it an "oppre . Ive cartoon." 

Thi S dellberatenes. erves the film' s purpose well becau e "The 
Merchant Of Four Sea. ons" I a depres. IOgly affecting movie that 
adamantly stre ed the emotional and- ocial oppre iveness of the 
bourgeoi mentality. It foeu eson a despondent fruit peddler (Imm 
Hermann) coming apart at the seams in an environment of hostile 
interraction. He is a failure at a ll he attempts: student, so ldier, 
policeman, fruit vendor, husband , father, lover, son, brother and 
man . He i betrayed and derailed by those who surround him: his 
women, s uperiors, family and fri end. 

Fassbinder chronicles the frustra ted, dehumanizing, and in-
discreet ugliness of the bourgeois e in a series of cruel and evocative 
tableaux. His means of fram ing exacting images are vivid ly stark: 
s ultry shots of long-legged women with dark rc!d lips tea<;ing, 
taunting, tormenting; slow-tracking hots punctuat ing the 
debilitating ritual of famil y get- togethers; hanging, lingering shots 
of the fruit-peddler in abject hum iliation. 

Fassbinder's intentions are never ambiguous. They are always 
concise and focused . His stringent methods attentuate hi s s ubject 
matter. His hot, aturated color heightens the impact of each . cene, 
forcing it se lf upon th e eyes and directing itself upon the brain . His 
nervously neering dialogue is angered and provoking. 

By bein g 0 forcefull y" oap operatic" Fassbinder rings intensity 
out of ea h individual moment, leaving nothing to happen. tance. 

Very few recent film s have had such a tyrannica l ense of ar-
ti<;try . Among the new, self-styled directors, only Terrance Malick 
("Badlands"), has exhi bited the same sort of programmed, 
controlled severity. LikeMalick, Fa binder realizes that to create a 
total, singular vi"ion, every moment, trivial or major, mu st be 
cogent , direct and pungenlly expre Ive. HI <; work de erves as large 
an audi ence as pos<,lble. 

Music and Castaneda Didn't Mix 
by Barry Bov how 

taff Wriler 

Over the last few year!;, the books of Carlos 
Castaneda have become increasingly popular. 
Dealing with the learning of true selfbeing 
through meditation and mind-expanding drugs, 
his writings have become 0 popular that hi 
late t book, VH / Tales of Power, remained high 
on best- eller li sts for month. 

Beca).l e of the increasing interest In 
astaneda, it eemed inevitable that someone 

would eventually get together a one-man reading 
from his works, as has been done with Shalom 
Alechem, Will Rogers and Mark Twain. 

Actor Bu rges Meredith, with the musical 
assistance of Charles Lloyd, debuted "Visions of 
Power" last Tuesday evening at the Mandeville 
center. The program's inspiration came from 
Meredith and Lloyd's own personal habits of 
meditation , and their hared inlerest in 
Castaneda's work . 

The concept of the evening wa interesting: 
.,piritual so unding readings intertwined with 
spiritual ounding music, ergo a spiritually 
moved audience. 

Thi s was not the case, however. I he 
presentation came off like a spiri tual-sounding 
seminar. . 

The main problem wa a lack of unity bet-
ween the music and the reading. It eemed as if 
Lloyd got together some musical instruments and 

wa an apparent attempt to produce a musical 
shado~ behind the reading, but there appeared 
to be more awkward and unmusical moments 
thJin anything el e. It came off as a battle bet-
ween words and music, with no harmony bet-
ween the two. 

Meredith' talent of speak ing was applied 
perfectly to Castaneda's script. Th e melodious 
words flowed well off the actor's experienced 
tongue. But it didn't seem as if he really believed 
what he was saying. 

Also, his elections were so long that the point 
of each reading was lost in his continuous 
speech. Here again, the combatant force of the 
music didn't make matters better. 

In addition to the Castaneda readings, 
Meredith chose selections from Dr. Franklin 
Merrill Wolfe, Maharishi and Suzuki -- three 
philosophers whose thinking is simi liar to 
Castaneda's.
