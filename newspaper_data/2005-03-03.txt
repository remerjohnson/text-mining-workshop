New slates to compete in A.S. election 
By VLADIMIR KOGAN 

News Editor 

Though they dominated the 
A.S. candidate pool in recent years, 
neither the Students First' nor 
Unity slates have filed to compete 
in this year's campuswide elections, 
according to preliminary candidate 
information relea ed by A.S. exec-
utive assistant Azizi Stephens. 

Overall, 25 candidates filed 
paperwork by the Feb. 28 deadline 
to compete for a campu wide 
execlltive office, falling from 27 
last year. Only three of the candi-
dates are running independent 
campaigns, with the rest split 
between three new slates. 

Due to varying filing deadlines, a 
final list of senatorial candidates has 
not yet been released. 

"I think this should be a really 
solid election," A.S. Elections 
Manager Steve York said, pointing 
out that candidates in most cabinet

slots will run in competitive ra es. 
Four candidates will square off . 

for the top spot of president. A.S. 
Vice President of Finance Kevin 
Hanson, who ran victOriously with 
SUldents First! last year, ,vill head 
the new Revolution! ticket, the 
largest of the slates. 

Hanson will face off against 
another former Students First! vic-
tOr, Commissioner of Diversity 
Affairs Christopher Sweeten, who 
is running on the Student 
Empowerment slate. Both will 
compete against Earl Warren 
College senior and former 
Gtwrdiol1 staff member Daniel 
Watts, running on the Sungod 
Party slate, and independent candi-
date Keshav "Kiki" Boddula, aJohn 

Muir College junior. 
Only two candidates - both 

on the Revolution! slate - will 
run unopposed for the positions of 
vice president of academic affairs 
and commissioner of athletics. 

Despite a "great experience" 
running with Students First ' last 
year, Hanson said he decided to 
form his own coalition largely 
because of the role student cultural 
organizations played in choosing 
the slates candidates last year. As 
the majority of the Students First! 
constituency, members of the 
Student ffirmative Action 
Committee generally send political-
ly inexperienced representatives to 
the s~eering body to choose the 
slates members, Hanson said. 

"I could sense sort of with last 
year's elections that things were glued 
together enough to \vin, but that glue 
was falling apart," Hanson said. "I ran

Officials simplify visa process 
By CHRISTINE PAl 

Senior Staff Writer 

In response to reports of diffi-
culty in obtaining visa clearances 
to study in the United States, the 
Departments of State and 
Homeland Security have 
announced changes to streamline 
the visa process for international 
students and scholars. 

The initiative is intended to 
"lefine polICIes to reduce visa and 
port-of-entry processing times 
without compromising the securi-
ty of our country," State 
Department Assistant Secretary 

. for onsular Affairs Maura Harty 
and ' Department of Homeland 
Security Undersecretary for 
Border and Transportation 
Security Asa Hutchinson 

announced in a joint statement. 
The government announced 

the changes on Feb. 19, after the 
Government Accountability 
Office confirmed a significant 
decline in the time required for a 
Visas Manti clearance. 

Implemented in 1998, the 
Visas Mantis clearance is used to 
further screen foreign students 
and scholars to safeguard scientif-
ic and technological information 
and ensure homeland security. 

The reduction of processing 
time is a result of several reforms 
made by the Department of State 
after a February 2004 GAO study 
reported that foreign students faced 
challenges applying for visas. 

"The Visas Mantis progra m in 
essence is a check on certai n types 
of students," said J ess Ford, GAO 

Director for International Affairs. 
In order to obtain a student visa, 

international students must sched-
ule an appointment for an interview 
with a con ular official. If eligible 
after review, sUldents receive a visa 
within 24 hours, according to the 
GAO. However, students and 
scholars in fields deemed more sen-
sitive, such as science and technolo-
gy, often must undergo the Visas 
Mantis screeni ng that has, in the 
past, taken a considerable amount 
of time to process. 

The State D epartment, in 
coordination with the homel and 
security agency, sought to reme-
dy this particular step in the stu-
dent visa process because some 
students have experienced delays,

Business down in Student Center 
Construction, rain blamed for slump in sales 

By AMY IFURUNG 
Staff Writer 

For some businesses in Student 
Center, the building complex's 
expansion is coming at a cost. 
Since construction began earlier 
this fall, several vendors say they 
have noticed a marked decline in 
business - something they blame 
on reduced access to the complex. 

"We've seen an estimated 15- to 
20-percent decrease in revenues 
since construction has started," said 
George Gonzalez, an employee of 
the General Store Co-op, one of 
several affected businesses. 

The current expansion repre-
sents only the first of two parts of the

Senators vote down A.S. 
structure referendum 

Eight members absent from roll call 
votes, despite two-day extension 

By PATRICK ALLEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

On Feb. 25, the A.S. Council 
rejected a proposed students vote 
on another ballot measu re to 
change the structure of the A.s. 
elected body. 

The proposal would have given 
voting powers to college chairs and 
to A.S. executives, eliminating the 
voting powers of college senators. 

The existing structure of 
Associa ted SUldents' legislative 
body, which includes four senators 
from each college, is unju tified, 
according to Revelle College 
Senior Senator Ted McCombs, 
who submitted the legislation . 

"The main problem [\vith the 
system] is that the senate is a vestigial 
branch that doesn't need to be 
there," McCombs said. "There is no 
justification for a legislative branch, 
because Associated Students has such 
limited jurisdiction." 

Currently, senators have voting 
privileges, whi le the council chairs 
and the A.S. Executive Board do 
not. 

However, the referendum 
encountered opposition from the 
council, failing by a vote of 7-9-7. 
The vote was held by open roll call, 
allowing council members to cast a 

vote between the time of the forlllal 
Feb. 23 meeting and 4 p.m. 0 11 Feb. 
25. 

Thurgood Marshall College 
Junior Senator Kate Pillol1 said that 
her opposition to the referendum 
stemmed from the differences in 
respol1 ibilities between senators 
and executives, which includes the 
vice presidents and commissioners. 

"Fnur year ago, the executive., 
voted to take away their own vote," 
Pillon said . "They do a job for the 
A.S . Council rather than represent 
a constituency. The way we have 
the ystem right now makes sure 
that we have an absolute repre en-
tation of everyone on campus." 

Commissioner of tudcnr 
Advocacy Denis Shlllidt, an 
appointed executive, said that the 
proposed changes would effectively 
give each counci lmember a clear job 
description, but felt that his own 
position should not have a vote. 

The resul ts of the roll call vote, 
which also included funding to allow 
A.S. President Jenn Pae to retain a 
lawyer to review a new Food Co-op 
lease agreement, only served to prove 
the ineffectiveness of the current 
struCUtre, according to McCombs.

Elections: Students First! 
splits into two coalitions 

conrinued from page I 
on Students First! last year, but I did-
n't feel like I was included." 

As the former head of the cam-
pus Interfraternity Council, 
Hanson has included in his coali-
tion several candidates active in the 
Greek community, another tradi-
tional Srudents First' supporter. 

"I know it looks like a Greek 
slate a t the top, and I know it's 
going to be stereotyped as such, but 
it's a lot deeper than that," he said. 

Sweeten said that his slate, too. 
has abandoned the classic Students 
First! model and is dealing exclu-
sively wi th cultural organizations. 

"The sides have kind of splin-
tered off into two slates," said 
Eleanor Roosevelt College senior 
I-Iarish andagopal. last year's 
Srudents First! presidential candi-
date. "It's iust the evolution - the 
cycle of things. [ have no doubt 
that Srudents First! will be run-
ning again." 

Though Students First! swept 
almost all top offices last year -
and has generally enjoyed success 
at the polls since the mid-1990s 
- Nandagopal was defeated by 
independent candidate Jenn Pae. 

"v\le don't have a leader or a 
figurehead in office," Nandagopal 
said. "There is no one to keep 
things together." 

Muir senior Jeremy Cogan, 
who headed the Unity ticket last 

year, said he had met with 
Nandagopal this year to discuss 
combining the two slates, which 
originated from a single left-of-
center constituency. In the end, 
both decided to "let nature take its 
course," Cogan said, allowing up-
and-<:oming candidates to resurrect 
the groups they thought most 
appropriate. 

Watts said his slate will cam-
paign on a plan to create a second 
Sun God Festival, to be paid for by 
eliminating all stipends of elected 
and appointed A.S. officers and 
staff members. The slate will also 
release its budget proposal for 
review by all srudents, Watts said. 

"I think we share the same 
goals as Student Empowerment," 
he said. "We just have different 
ideas of what srudents want." 

Boddula said his independent 
run is just getting off the ground, 
and he thinks parking will be a 
main issue in the minds of voters. 

Though the elections manager 
is usually a behind-the-scene 
presence, York, too, has claimed a 
piece of the spotlight by garner-
ing na tional attention for his 
broadcast of amateur pornogra-
phy on Srudent-Run Television. 

However, York said the con-
troversy abour the incident would 
not affect his ability to effectively

Berkeley sues UC over 
campus expansion 
The city of Berkeley has sued the 

UC Board of Regents in hopes of 
stopping UC Berkeley's planned 
expansion. Last week. city officials 
filed a suit challenging the university's 
environmental impact reports, which 
accompany the long-range plan that 
maps out growth for the campus 
through 2020. 

In particular. administrators and 
local leaders have been at odds over 
the predicted increase in city services 
used by the university. such as sanita-
tion, and the compensation for the 
services. 

At the UC Board of Regents' 
January meeting of the committee on 
grounds and buildings, a large num-
ber of community groups spoke out 
during the public input portion of the 
session. expressing outrage with the 
proposed campus expansion plan. 
The regents unanimously approved 
the document. 

A day after the lawsuit was filed. 
the university denied that its planning 
process violated environmental pro-
tection procedures. stating that the 
current plan "does not preclude fur-
ther environmental review of any spe-
cific project"

1he university is sympathetic to 
the financial challenges faCing the city. 
and. as a member of this community. 
the campus wants to enhance the 
city's neighborhoods; the university 
stated in a written response to the 
lawsuit. 'The university. whose educa-
tional mission is supported by taxpay-
er funds. is dealing with financial con-
straints of its own. UC 8erkeley 
believes that our offer was a generous 
one." 

Report chides Ivy 
Leagues' eHorts 

The nation's most prestigious col-
lege 'campuses remain stratified by 
race. class and gender, according to a 
critical new report examining Ivy 
League campuses. 

Titled 'The (Un)Changing Face of 
the Ivy League: the report states that 
the exclUSive schools have lagged 
behind the national average in accep-
tance of students from minority ethnic 
groups. The number of Hispanic and 
black faculty at these campuses grew 
only slightly from 1993 to 2003. it 
found, increasing from 3 percent to 4 
percent of all tenured faculty over that 
time penod. 

tn addition. women faculty memo 
bers are paid almost 25 percent less 
than their male counterparts, on aver-
age. the report found. 

The report backs unionization 
among campus workers and laws that 
require private campuses to disclose 
racial data to the public. including a 
new bill currently in the Connecticut 
Legislature.

Sales: University Centers to promote vendors

building project, which is being paid 
for by self-assessed sntdent fees. 
Expected to finish in October, the 
present phase will add J3 ,000 addi-
tional square feet to faci lities in the 
areas around the north si de of 
Sntdent Center. Phase two, which 
will include construction within stu-
dent Center itself, will consist main-
ly of renovations of existing buildings. 

The project will also ensure that 
existing buildings comply with the 
Americans with Disabilities Act, 
which requi res the presence of 
restrooms for the di ahled and 
wheelchair-accessible elevators. 
Measures will also be raken to 
replace uneven bricks along path-
ways in order to accoll1 modate 
wheelchairs. 

"Our main objective is to improve 
utilization of Srudent Center in a way 
that will improve the places there," 
University Centers Director Gary 
Ratcliff said. 

Businesses have attributed a 
general decrease in foot traffic 
throughout the area to the project. 

"With the lack of pathways 
around Mandeville Center, people 
find it harder to find themselves 

over here." Gonalez said. 
In an unusually wet winter, the 

weather has also proved to be a major 
issue, with the complex providing lit-
de indoor seating. Ratcliff said dlat 
excessively rainy weather may also be 
:I factor responsible for the decrease 
in revenues among businesses. 

"There's very little indoor seat-
ing in Student Center. so that 
makes it a little difficult for student~ 
to visit during the rains," Ratcliff 
said. "That's one of the points we 
are trying to fix." 

The project will create addition-
al interior dining seating designed 
for 160 ind ividuals. 

Other businesses. such as 
Groundwork Books, said they are 
also experiencing a decline in sales. 

"There's definitely fewer people 
coming around," said Adriana 
Guajardo, an employee of the book 
collective. "1 haven't seen any num-
bers, but we had to return a lot of 
books to the publishers this quarter." 

Phase two of the building project 
will include the destruction of 
Groundwork Books' present facility, 
eventually placing it in a more central 
location in Srudent Center. 

Due to major construction cen-

tered in the complex itself, phase 
two of the plan has already caused 
anxiety for businesses. 

"We haven't really experienced 
anything major so far with phase 
one," UCSD Bike Shop Manager 
Kris Wells said. "It's really phase 
two that I'm worried about, because 
that will wrap construction right 
around the shop. \Ve're afraid peo-
ple are going to as ume that busi-
nesses aren't in operation." 

University Centers is taking 
action to protect busine ses with 
banner adverti ing Srudent Center 
vendors, according to Ratcliff. 

"We're making sure there's 
going to be an outreach campaign 
so that students are fully aware that 
these services are open," he said. 

Phase two. to begin March 2006, 
will also complete renovating existing 
electrical and fire systems. 

"In the short term, there are defi-
nitely going to be inconveniences," 
Ratcliff said. "But really, we're going 
to end up with a much better Student 
Center, and I don't think anyone is 
going to have any regrets."

Himself a pre\~ous candidate for 

oHice, York lost in each of the past 
two years, walking away with 12 
percent of the vote in hi indepen-
dent presidential bid last yea r. The 
experience, he said , has helped pre-
pare him for his current task. 

"Basically, the election~ com-
mittee wili not have the wool 
pulled over its eyes," he said. 

Two years ago, York also filed 

the election-day grievance that led 
to the slate-wide disqualification of 
Students First! candidates, an inci-
dent that caused lasting bad blood 
between York and the slate. 

"If any of my friends get unjust-
ly disqualified this YC'lr. I'm defi-

lawyer and urhri ng them to take thiS

ter choice could have been made. 

But right now, teve is dlC elections 
manager, and I'll support him." 

York said he'll gladly address 
individual concerns about his per-
formance, but that he shares a 
vision for well-run elections. 

"I only w3nt fair elections for 
the campus." he ald. "\.\le may not

A.S. Council structure 
needs reorganization 

W hile there is the perception of wid espread apa -
thy toward Associated 
Students, it doesn't mean 
that UCS D students 
shouldn 't care about what 
goes on in the .S. Council. 

Just ask A.S . President 
Jenn Pae, who was unable 
to get fundin g from A.s. 
reserves to hire a la .... 'Yer to 
renew the preliminary co-
op agreement in part 
beca use nine A.S. senators 
could not find the time to 
vote on the issue between 
Feb. 23 and Feb. 25 . The 
cou ncil needed support 
from two-thirds of its 24 
voting members to release 
the funds; if eight senators 
don't vote, it's impossible to 
get a two-thirds majority. 

fter fighting for negoti-
,ltiOIlS and an agrec.:me nt 
with the university, the 
Council should be ashamed 

that it can't even supply 
enough roll call votes to 
make approval of this 
important allocation possi-
ble . While the absent sena-
tors may have purposefully 
voted "no" with their feet, 
college constihlents are left 
with no clear notion of how 
their representatives felt 
about the issue. 

Clearly, there is som e-
thin g wrong with a voting 
and representation struc-
ture that e lects senators 
who can't fulfill their most 
basic responsibiliti es. 
While it's too late to change 
the structure for the 
upcoming elections, next 
year's elected offi cials 
should think long and hard 
about how to structure an 
A.S. Council that can better 
serve the UCSD students 
- that is, after they finally 
finish filling the certain -to-
be-empty senator spots. 

UC's public mission 
shrinking with funds 

T he changing face of UCSD is emblem-atic of the changes 
occlllTi ng throughout the 

niversity of California. 
Judging by the campus 

books, UCS D ca n more 
accurate ly be ca ll ed th e 
University o f the ationa l 
Science Foundation or 
University of Ernest Rady, 
to reAect the shrinking rol e 
of the sta te and increasing 
role of private and federal 
funding. 

Last year, the ca mpus 
received less than 15 per-
cent of its total revenue 
from the state of California. 
The amount i not even 
half of what it made just by 
operating UCS D Medical 
Center, and these kinds of 
numbers repre ent the 
tranSitIons taking place 
around the enti re un iversity 
system. 

Needle s to say, the 
"pub li c" face of the 
University of California is 
mutating, and these 
changes contribute to the 

fundamental transforma-
tion of the university. 

More and more, we have 
come to rely on one-time 
federal grants - a danger-
ous position under the like-
ly cuts we will see see in the 
federal budget - as our 
share of the s tate budget 
continues to shrink. 

Slowly but surely, these 
transformations are erod-
ing the university'S com-
mitm ent to public service, 
a co re idea l preached by 
th e UC Board of Regents 
and manifested in the 
Master Plan for Higher 
Education. 

UCSD's decision to 
close down Hillcrest 
Hospital - serving primar-
ily the poor - in favor of a 
richer La Jolla patient base 
shows the university'S 
changing values: profit over 
public good. 

Though perhaps 
inevitable, these changes 
must be honestly acknowl-
edged by the university and 
the state it once embodied .

Unhelpful 
thoughts 

Brian Uiga 

T he D:lrk Lord Satan went job-hunting last week at UCSD. Of course, I'm not 
talking about the literal 
"Beel ze bub" version of Satan with 
the pointy ears and a tail , but the 
less popular "Lucifer" variety. The 
Fallen Angel. He who, under the 
guise of misguided faith, has 
caused 16 genocides and various 
assorted evils. 

Lucifer had no hair. He also 
carried a tall handmade sign fas-
tened to his belt that held a couple 
of particularly poignant Bible 
verses on one side and the groups 

. those verses supposedly applied to 
on the other. The Voice of Lucifer 
was loud and forceful, a fact of 
which anyone unfortunate enough 
to be eating I unch in Price Center 
the afternoon of Feb. 24 quickly 
became aware . 

Yct it is what came out of T-lis 
Unholy Mouth that is of the most 
importance. In aU of my personal 
experiences with evil, [ have never 
experienced such vicious and hate-
ful attacks. TIle topic du jour was 
homosexuality, the practitioners of 
which werc dubbed "Sodomites" by 
th e Dark Lord. With a loud, psy-
chotic frenzy, Lucifer described tlle 
various, well-deserved lOrmres 

Sodornites would undertake in His 
Domain. 

A large crowd had gathered, 
cringing with every new exclama-
tion but helpless to do anything but 
stand by and watch the train wreck 
in progress. Police stood by, on 
pins and needles. In an attempt to 
lighten up the situation, some 
lanky kid stepped up to the podium 
and pretended to agree with His 
Unholiness, "Yeah, you know what 

" The topic du jour was homosexuality, the 
practitioners of which 

were dubbed 'Sodomites' 
by the Dark Lord. " 

it says in the Bible? We should slit 
the Sodomites' throats! Kill them 
all, men, women and children!" 

The crowd nervollsly laughed 
at such a ridiculous suggestion. 
Until Lucifer responded, dead 
serious, "No, my son, we don't slit 
their throats." ([he crowd sighed 
with relief.) 

"We stone them!" 
Dead silence. The joke was over, 

Lucifer had proven his faith, and it 
scared the bejesus out of all present. 
The crowd turned ugly, their 
hatred beginning to match that of 
the Dark Lord. Shouting flared up 

on all sides, and anl:,rry students 
were clutching their chairs, ready to 
use them 3S bludgeoning imple-
ments. lt was time to lake the street 
theater a step further and defuse 
this ticking time bomb. 

What would Jesus do? I have 
no idea . But the topic had shifted 
to the unholiness of non-Christian 
religions, so [ decided to do wh at 
Mel Brooks would do 
(WWMBD?) and stepped up to 
the podium. 

"The Jews killed J esus l " I 
screamed to the waiting multi-
tudes. "And we are all Jews here, 
for we all have sinned I We all have 
partaken in the pleasures of hell' '' 

My overzealous accent was not 
pleasing Lucifer, who took a swing 
at me with his sign. Not to be dis-
couraged by His Evil Ways, I con-
tinued, "For after all, homosexuali-
ty comes from hell! And sodomy 
comes from hell! And drugs and 
alcohol come from hell l And 
decent literature comes from hell!" 

My sermon was rising to a 
fevered pitch. 

"And, my friends, if that is 
what comes of hell and what 
returns of hell, we should all be 
thankful for our sinning ways, for 
hell is whm the pllrty isl" 

The crowd roared with laugh-
ter. I fell to my knees and spread 
my arms to the sky, "And, by 
Jesus, if I am wrong, may God 

trike me down where [ stand!" 
Again, Lucifer attempted to

'Thoughts: Religious fervor can be alienating

strike me down where l stood with 
his Un holy Placard, but God kept 
his linger off the smite button and I 
was allowed to continue. 

T he erstwhi le scrmon thcn con-
tinued into territory on respecting 
one's fellow man and Jesus' idea of 
love, and why it is the will of 
Lucifer to listen only to "those who 
shout loudest with no discernible 
logic." By the end of my 10-minute 
improvised speech, I received a 
standing ovation and Lucifer slunk 

. back to His Hyundai, his Unholy 
Power of Persuasion having been 
banished from our recently sancti -
fied campus. 

Do T feel any guilt or shame for 
having humiliated this vicio us 
preacher attempting to spread his 
religious views? Of course not. 1 
have the utmost re pect for all reli-
gious displays, but I will answer the-
ater with more theater. Any legiti-
mate practi tioners of the holy arts 
are welcome to have their say, but 
must be open to criticism of their 
faith, or they might as well not have 
any faith at all. Strong faith will 
guide those who are of good will 
and strong moral character; weak 
faith will be completely under-
mined by a half-assed comedy act 
featuring a preacher character. 

Lucifer was suffering from an 
ac ute case of Vicious Preacher 
Disease, and it is Vicious Preacher 
Di ease that has co-opted tlle uni -
versal mes ages of these reli gio ns 
(mostly Western ones, for some 
reason) and has cau ed their ven-
omous filth to be spewed acros the 
planet. But where doe Vicious 
Preacher Di case come from, and 
what are its roots) Fortunately for 
you , five yea rs ago my res~arch 
came across a larval stage. 

The year was 2000. I was a lowly 
freshman, a virgin in every sense of 
the word, and cynicism had not yet 

passed over my pasty brow. Life 
was sweet and uncomplicated. I was 
walking hdme from my entry-level 
chemistry class when a little old 
lady crossed my path. I had no rea-
son to fear her. I had just seen the 
anciem Helen Hayes the night 
before dancing with Volkswagens 
in "H erbie Rides Again," so I had 
an unreasonable expectation that 
old ladies were full of cupcakes and 
grace. I was soon to learn other-
wise. She stopped me with a smile 

" Do I feel any guilt err 
shame ferr having 

humiliated this vicious 
preacher attempting to 

spread his reagious views? 
Of course not, I have the 

utmost respect for all 
reagious displays, but I 
will answer theater with 

more theater." 
and a cheaply printed pamphlet. 

"D o you mind if I ask you about 
your religious beliefs)" 

Again, the warm and open smile 
beckoned, so I to ld her I was a non-
practicing Zen Buddhist who vol -
unteered at a facility to stop hate 
crime and made silly -rated tele-
vision shows. 

Then the little old lady told me 
I was going to hel l. . 

Sure, she gave it a nice little spin 
("I'm sorry that you hu\'c to hear 
[his, but you 're going to hell. "), but 
the fact that this aged wOlllan had 

sea led my destiny a minute and a 
half into our exc hange was a little 
bit frightening. I should have been 
ti pped off by one of her questions : 

Old Lady: " D o you think you' ll 
get into Heaven?" 

Me: "Sure." 
Old Lady: "And why do you 

think that?" 
M e: "I'm a good person and I 

help out people however I can." 
Old Lady: "You know, being a 

good person won't get you into 
heaven." 

I still remember those words, 
five years later: " Being a good per-
son won't get you into heaven." 
Logic explodes like a magic mush-
room . 0 argument or evidence 
ca n sway you to the contrary 
because you have been touched by 
Vicious Preacher Disease. 

Daunting as this affliction may 
see m, many people live thei r lives 
today without the threat of Vicious 
Preacher Disease. They make their 
own choices regarding the infinite 
and shut the fuck up; they lead by 
exa mple; they try to persuade oth-' 
ers by showing how much they own 
their religion . Then they allow 
each mind to make its own deci -
sion. 

But it's the ufferers of Vicious 
Preacher Disease who ruin religion 
for us all. They do it by flying 
planes into buildings and calling it 
a Holy War, by lynching transves-
tites and calling it "protection of 
the family" or by standing in the 
middle of Price Center and cream-
ing of the damnation of people 
attempti ng to enjoy their lunch . 

But there is hope, becau e suf-
ferers of Smartass Attention 
Whore Public Disobedience 
Syndrome :lre here to help.

Visas: Changes speed up applications 
continued from page I 

according to the GAO. 
The reduction of the visa clearance proce-

dure has decreased processing time to about 
two weeks, as compared to an average of 67 
days in 2004. 

T he changes, however, have stOpped short 
of putting an end to all in-person interviews, a 
requirement that has been urged by several 
higher education advocates. Despite the accel-
erated schedule, federal officials said that the 
screening process will continue in order to 
protect national security. 

"The provisions to do the security checks 
are still there," Ford said. " Basically, what we're 
tallcing about is management improvement." 

Improvements were achieved by increas-
ing staff, providing guidance to consular 
posts, upgradmg to more sophisticated tech-
nology systems and reasserting priority inter-
view appointments for foreign students, 
acco rding to the most recent GAO study. 

International students will now be able to 
retain their visa clearance for up to four 
years, malcing it easier for students to visit 
home for vacations. 

"With the new polici es in place, the stu-
dent will only lleed to apply for a new visa," 
Associate Director of UCSD International 
Center Michael Hindi said. "This makes 
short .visits, like winter breaks, possible, and 
it makes longer visits, like those over the 
summer, less risky." 

For some students, however, applying for a 
student visa has not been a grave difficulty. 
University of Bologna senior Valeria Huerta, 

who came from Argentina to study at UCSD's 
Eleanor Roosevelt College for one year, sa id 
that applying for a visa was not a problem, 
thanks to the established foreign exchange 
program between the two univer ities. 

"I think the situa,tion is different when 
you want to go 011 your own," Huerta said . 
"But since it was a thing between universities, 
I had no problem." 

John Muir College senior Sonali Nigam, a 
student from India, came to UCSD as an 
undergraduate to study bioengineering. The 
process to study in the United States was 
uncomplicated, Nigam said, citing separate 
reasons for difficulties faced by other students . 

"It had definitely gotten tougher after 
9/11, but a lot of it has to do with the eco-
nomics of it," N igam said . "For students 
whose parents are not supporting them, it 
will be hard to prove that they will able to 
support themselves for four years." 

Despite the reported improvements, some 
consular offices are still experiencing delays 
and have yet to adopt the new eleco-onic track-
ing system to ensure a more smooth Visas 
Mantis process, according to the GAO report. 
Students from some counnies, like China, 
experience addi tional difficul ties in visa renew-
al due to lack of clarity within the program. 

"The hope is that, at least [by] improving 
this part of the program, it will not discourage 
legitimate students from coming to the States," 
Ford said.

Votes: Council to vote on alternative 
cominued from page I 

did not show up to the meeting or stay for the 
whole meeting, and they are not doing their 
jobs," McCombs sa id. "The $1 ,000 allocation 
fo r a lawyer fai led, not because people were 
opposed to it, but becau e no one showed 
up ." 

[n order to be approved, the mandated 
funds allocation required the approval of 18 
senators. Though no senator opposed the allo-
cation, it ultimately failed by a vote of 13-0-10. 

Of the J 0 se nators who did not cast votes, 
six senators were not pre ent at the Feb. 23 
m eeting, two attended the start of ule meet-
ing but left before the poll was called, and twO 
were present but chose to abstai n. . 

Members of the cou ncil have also said 
they were concerned about levels of atten-
dance at the regular council meetings, which 
take place every Wednesday. 

John Muir College Junior Senator Neil 
Spears said that the especially low attendance 
at the meeting on Feb. 23 posed difficulties 
for the senators that were present. 

"No one was able to go to the bathroom 
because if they did, we would not have quo-
rum," Spears said. "The power of the A.S. 
Council was held hostage by (John Muir 
College Senior Senator] Arman Oepanians 
shuttle, and that's not Arman's fault." 

Depanian relies on the campus shuttle for 

transportation, but could not leave the meet-
ing due to the low attendance, creating pres-
sure on the council to complete busi ness 
while the shuttles were sti ll in operation. 

Council bylaws require that morc Ulan half 
of the 24 senatol'S on the council be present at 
the meeting to conduct official business. 

PiUon, who also erves as ule senate chair, 
said she understands that senators will not have 
perfect anendance, but said he believes al l sen-
ators should vote in an open roll call. 

"I'm not going to hold it against senators for 
not making meetings," Pillo n said. "We all have 
other conunionents. But the reason for an open 
roll call is to get input from senators who can't 
make the meeting. It is irresponsible for people 
to not vote when they are given a chance." 

Though council anendance dropped to its 
operational minimum last week, Pillon said 
that the senate has been able to stay productive. 

In its meeting on March 2, the A.S. inter-
nal committee voted to reject another refer-
endum submitted by Pae that proposed a dif-
ferent change to the structure of Associated 
Students. Due to ballot deadlines, no more 
referenda will be submitted before the spring 
quarter elections. A final role call vote on the 
measure will be open through March 4 .

FROM REGGAE TO JAZZ TO ROCK 

WANDER THE MUSICAL MAP 

By •• MUIGA 
Senior Staff Writer 

Local favorites Irradio have never had it so good. With the release of their slick alb~ Milite Up For the }fIII"gurtluJ, produced by 
studio guru Ben Moore (Hot Snakes, Rocket 
From the Crypt), these five virtuosos are finding 
their way out from the fringes of the local San 
Diego scene toward a broad acceptance of their 
offbeat sound. 

Fresh off tbe heels of a triumphant " mini-
tour" that found them spreading their tunes 
nationwide, Irradio will play a free show at 
Porter's Pub on March 5. Musically, Irradio are 
all over the, place, yet somehow manage to wear 
their radio friendliness on their sleeve. Funk, 
reggae, jazz and occasional electronica weave 
their way through each song like individual fish, 
but thanks to the punk sensibility of Dan 

Dasher's energetic vocals, the school is ~ell 
behaved and catchy as hell . In addition to hold -
ing the band's sound together, Dasher also pro-
vides Irradio with their greatest chaotic element: 
Along with fellow guitar wielder Paulo Zuniga, 
the duo form a guitar matchup unlike anything 
you have ever heard. Their odd, lilting guitar 
melodies are simultaneously in time and out of 
time, hummable yet incomprehensibl e, the musi-
cal equivalent of hoolcing up an electrocardio-
gram to an 3mplifier. To top it all off, the entire 
musical package is wrapped up like an origami 
crane with the Zen-like si lences offered by a lack 
of fuzzy distortion pedals and the occasional 
ethereal organ arrangements courtesy of the 
band's newest member, Edgar Alminar. 

If this amy description sounds like the latest 
audio masturbation from the likes of Modest 
Mouse, pay heed: Irradio are sti ll punk, and still

50 Cent 
The Massacre 

Aftermath 

**.; 

De pite 50 Cent's media overexposure, it seems that he sti ll wants to 
share more of hil115elf with 
his fans. Curtis J ackson 
details his new lifestyle on 
his econd release, The 
MrlssaC7l:, and apparently he 
has a whole lot of money, 
women, cars and guns to 
complement his self-pro-
fessed God-given style. 

It wouldn't be a 50 Cent 
album without a legitimate 
club banger, and the Scott 
Storch-produced "Candy 

hop" is his fi rst attempt, 
although "Just a Lil' Bi t," 
another Storch beat, might 
be more successful. "Out of 
Control" and "Disco 

Inferno" are also catchy 
songs for the club, but 
many fans won't like con-
stantly hearing aboU[ 50's 
"lollipop" and his sexual 
escapades. 

Sex certainly seems para-
mount in 50~ life, bll! he 
knows he sti ll must appeal to 
the streets, and " Piggy 
Bank," in which he disses 
Fat Joe, Jadakiss, Shyne and 
Kelis, is his taunting 
reminder to the rap world 
that he is no joke. "Gatman 
and Robbin '" is a sort of 
sequel (Q Eminem's 
"Business," using a remark-
ably similar beat to the orig-
inal, but creating a remark-
ably worse song. 

Fans of 50 Cent will 
enjoy this CD, and at 22 
tracks wi th 113lY a ski t, you 
definitely get your money's 
worth. The main problem 
with Tht Massacre is that it is 
full of average songs and has 
no uni fying concept; the 
record si mply becomes sclf-
indulgent lifestyle flossing 
for 50 Cenr. 

We know you've gOt 
money, we know you're 
hard, and we know women 
like your muscles, so stop 
reminding us.

Jennifer Gentle 
Valende 
Sub Pop 

**** 

As if the acid casualties of the '60s (Skip Spence, Roky Erickson and Syd 
Barrett) were the subjects of 
a daydreaming Itali an 
renaissance, the 0110 Italiano 
of Jennifer Gentle conjures 
up the brilliant lysergic 
madness of psychedelia and 
commands it \vith brilliant 
vivacity. Jennifer Gende 
sound exactly like children 
sprung fully armed with 
guitars and dnlmsticks from 
the opened skull of Barren, 
recreating the childlike 
wonderment and manic 
insanity. Valnule is distinctly 
contemporary, payi ng 
respect to modern trip-
freaks Anima l Collective, 

while carvi ng out a more 
Europea n modern psyche-
delia niche. The album's 
single, "I Do Dream You," 
sounds like a twisted British 
Invasion one-off running at 
double speed and fcantres a 
squeaking ba lloon solo. 

Compared to the 
amphetamine-fueled single, 
many of the album tracks 
seem to be coaxed from 
sleepy Saturday daydreal115. 
"Tiny Holes" and "Circles 
of Sorrow" seem to play just 
slightly slower than they 
should, combining drones 
and glockenspiel with vocals 
half-heard and remembered 
again in a dream. The sonic 
cannon acid test 
"Hessesopoa" divides "The 
Garden" into two parts of 
acoustic Brit-folk, which 
guides the rest of the 
soporific album until the 
uppers kick back in for a 
final Chipmun.kian rave-up. 

0(1 Va/mdt, the young 
Italians' first album for leg-
endary Sub Pop records, the 
duo invokes the spiritual-
ized heroes of psychedelia 
and forces the modern 
world into the snow-globe 
daydream of Jennifer 
Gentle.

Tori Amos 
The Beekeeper 

Sony 

*** 

Before Alanis, before Fiona , there was Tori Amos - one of the 
most innovative female 
si nger/songwriters of the 
1 990s. She proved piano 
players can rock with her 
brea kthrough album, 
Linlt Earthquakes, and its 
follow-up, Undtr tht Pink. 

Her latest album, Tbe 
Bukeeptr, is further proof 
that this cui t hero is 
evolving in to a ca lmer 
artist . Amos ' ninth album 
is her mellowest and most 
mainstream to date. 

However, one of the 
most captivating aspects 
of Amos' earlier work 
(and one that her latest 

album lacks) is intensity. 
Gone are the heart-
pounding piano rhythms 
and harrowing lyrics of 
her previous work, 
replaced with softer 
melodic music. 

Although Tht Beekeepu· 
could be mistaken for a 
Starbucks compilation, 
the soulful melody in 
"Sweet the Sting" and her 
collaboration with 
Damien Rice on "The 
Power Orange Knickers" 
make the album worth-
while. 

Glim pses of the pas-
sionate ballads th at dom-
inated Amos' previous 
albums ca n still be heard 
in songs like "Barons of 
Suburbia." None of the 
tracks o n The Bu keepa· 
have the haunting lyrics of 
Amos' most prolific song, 
"Me and a Gu n," from 
Little Earthquakes; instead, 
she sings about butterflies 
and drivi ng through 
Ireland, but it's a welcome 
transition. 

With a long-s tanding 
successfu l ca reer and a 
new family, can we blame 
her for makin g livelier 
music?

Irradio: Post .. punk ~nd jazzy 
. chops mark local rockers 

continued from page 7 
rock, but it's punk to bump and 
grind to, as opposed to punk to 
t he shatter-somebody's-coll ar-
bone-in-a-mosh-pit va riety. This 
sexiness endures, thanks to the fat 
rhyth ms of brothers C had and 
Collin Tuthill on bass and drums, 
respectively. 

[f the musical composi tion of 
Irradio seems to be an explo ration 
of variety, t h e band 's politica l 
message is along the same lines -
harmony and the u e of diversity 
(musical and otherwise) for the 
greatest possibl e good. owhere 
is this more evident than on their 
soa ring sing le "One Sound," 
which has been featured on vari-
o us compi lati ons and encourages 
everyone to dance to the one uni-

versal human song and consider 
o ther political concerns such as 
"the best of free trade ." 

Whether you're interested in 
hearing a bit of political post-punk, 
want to see some serious musical 
chops or are just interested in a free, 
energetic live show, Irradio's March 
5 offering will not disappoint. 

Arts-a nd-crafts types might be 
interes ted to know that the show 
is designated "Dasher Jacket 
Charity Night," where the some-
what legendary shredded leather 
duds of [rradio 's front man will be 
re placed by the best submission 
fro m the audience, an "American 
Idol" contest of sorts where the 
prize is Dasher's torso. So be sure 
to bring any starstruck cl othing 
yo u may have lying around .

game is getting too boring with 
the implementation of the neutral

One of the saddest things to 
come out of this awful mess is the 
hundreds of people who were rely-
ing on having a season to feed their 
families and pay their bills. The 
non-contract employees (including 
ushers, concession workers, team 
officials, parking attendants and 
frOnt office Staff) all have to look 
elsewhere for a job.

continued from page r 2 
The victory bumped the Tritons' 
record to 3 -I going into the Feb. 
27 match. 

UCSD also won the first match 
of the three-day competition. On 
Feb. 25, the men faced rival 
Hawaii-Hilo, a team known for its 
tennis talent, and also one that the 
Tritons trumped 5-0 last year to 
make it round of 16 in the NCAA 
Division II Men's Tennis 
Championship - and this meet-
ing was not much different. 

The Tritons jumped out to an 
early lead, winning [\Yo of the three 
doubles matches. Molden and 
Spector defeated Hilo 's J eremy 
Moioy and Dan Pollock, 8-5, at 
No.1 doubles, while Swatt teamed 
up with Rubens to beat their oppo-
nents quickly, 8-2. 

The first three matches in the 
lineup all ended in three-set victo-
ries for the Tritons. At No. I, 

Swatt lost the first set, 4-6, to 
Moitry, but came back with a sec-
ond set 6-4 win, and narrowly 
pulled Out the match with a 7-5 
win in the third set. At N o. 2 sin-
gles, Molden lost a close first set, 
5-7, but came back to overpower 
his opponent, 6-1, 6-2 , in the next 
[\Yo sets. 

At No. 3, Spector won a lop-
sided match, taking the first set 6-
2, losing the second 2-6, and fin-
ishing off his opponent 6-2 for the 
·win. Oijala, who played at No. 4 
singles, won a quick 6- 1, 6- 1 
match, and Meister, at No. 5, held 
off a second-set comeback by 
Hilo 's Samejima, winning his 
match, 6- 1, 7-6. 

The only other Hilo win came 
at No. 6 singles, in which Hilo's 
Mitchel Gelina defeated Phan in a 
close 7 -6, 6-4 match . The wins 
gave the Tritons a 7-2 victory over 
Hawaii-Hilo. . 

Polo: Sanders criticizes Tritons' performance 
continued from page 12 

goal. 
UCSD had a case of deja vu in its 

next match against Stanford, the 
same team they faced in the second 
game of last year's Gaucho 
Invitational. Unfortunately for the 
Tritons, the outcome was also iden-
tical as the Cardinal rolled to an 1 1-
3 triumph on the strength of aney 
EI-Sakkary's four goals. 

Clevenger notched another goal 
for UCSD, adding on to scores from 
junior driver Flynn LaRochelle and 
freslunan [\Yo-meter Judy Emaus. 
Katie Hansen also earned a hat trick 
for the Ca~dinal, who would go on 
to finish third in the tournament. 

With the I-I opening-day finish, 
UCSD caprured second place in its 
round-robin group and found itself 
in a tight match against No. 6 
Indiana on Feb 26. After falling 
behind 2-0 in the first quarter, 
UCSD fought back with a pair of 
goals to cut the Hoosiers' lead to 3-

2 at the half. 
But UCSD could not find the 

goals to top Indiana, despite having 
plenty of opporrunities. The Tritons 
went l-for- 13 on man-up advan-
tages, while the Hoosiers scored four 
goals in the second half for the win. 
Sophomore two-meter Brina 
Nordstrom, freshman utility Jessica 
Momberg, Perkins and Clevenger 
all contributed goals in the loss. 

"If we had made just a third of 
those man-ups, we could have won 
the game. It just shows that we need 
to be doing a better job with our 
scoring," Sanders said. 

In the Tritons' fourth game, UC 
Irvine put in four goals in the second 
quarter to gain a 6-2 advantage at 
halftime and a 7-5 victory over 
UCSD. TIle Tritons scored twice 
while shutting out the Anteaters in 
the third period, but onl y managed 
one point versus the four put up by 
thei r opponents before the half. 
Lyman led UCSD scorers wi th two 

goals, while Clevenger notched a 
point for the fourth consecutive 
match . Nordstrom and Lauren 
Woods also scored for the Tritons. 

At the end of the long weekend, 
UCSD found itself pitted against 
Princeton in the 15th-place match 
on Feb. 27. The Tritons' costly 
errors throughout the first half in 
hauding the Tigers a 4-0 advantage 
going into the third period. 

Sarah Bajorek drew the Tritons a 
goal closer when she scored with 
3 :58 lefr in the third, but the Tigers 
scored again in the final period to 
restore their commanding lead. 

"We created a lot of unforrunate 
errors," Sanders said. "We were the 
better team but we pretty much gave 
them their goals." 

The Tritons now look ahead to 
their biggest matches of the season, a 
meeting with rivals Loyola 
Marymount and Chapman. Both 
ga mes wi ll be held at Loyola 
Marymounr in Los Angeles.

Tritons impress at Rossi Relays 
Track and field starts chipping at records 

Men's tennis controls 
Division-II homestand 

By JESSICA NAGER 
Staff Writer 

The men's and women's track 
and field teams kicked off their 
season on Feb. 25 at the Rossi 
Relays, which were hosted by 
Claremont Coll ege in Claremont, 
Calif. Both teams had solid show-
ings, with multiple fini shers in the 
top hal f of each event. Between 
the two teams, 14 performances 
were among the top 10 in UCS D 
history. • 

The women's team had an 
exceptionally strong showi ng, 
ga thering two CAA quali fying 
cutS in the first meet. enior 
Kendra Canape, who won the 
2003 CCAA Championship in the 
high jump, broke the former 
school record of 5-6, set by team-
mate Kelsey Turner during the 
2004 season, and met the NCAA 
qualifiying mark with her jump of 
5-7 3/4. Canape shared her first-
place fini h with Helke Siener 
from Point Lorna and Alexandia 
C hu rch of Univeristy of San 
Diego. Turner finished fourth . 

Freshman Laiah Blue received 
her NCAA qualifying mark in the 
I OO-meter hurdl es with a time of 
14.32 econds in the third -fastest 
time in school history. She fin-
ished fou rth at the Rossi Relays, 
behind three All -American hur-
dlers from University of 
Southern California . Freshman 
Kaylin Siever was quick behind 
her, finishi ng sixth with a time of 
15.09. 

Freshman Whitney Johnson 
made first place in the triple jump, 
with a mark of 38- 10 1/4, and 
made an CAA provisional quali-
fying cut. Johnson al 0 received 
fi rst place in the long jump, with a 

mark of 18-5 that tied the Rossi 
Relays' meet record. Sophomore 
Elise Holiday fini shed second in 
the long jump, with a mark of 17-
10 1/4. Holiday also si lvered in the 
100-meter dash with a time of 
12 .39, just 0.22 seconds away from 
first place. For long-distance 
events, Emily McGregor finished 
third in the 3 ,ODD-meter run with 
a ti me of 10:2 5.25. 

In the relays, the women's dis-
tance medley - composed of 
juniors Mimi Hodgi ns and junior 
Gi na Merchant, freshman Diane 
Dunn and senior Lindsay Stalker 
- dominated among the other 
schools, finishing with a time of 
12:02. 14, over 18 seconds before 
second-place USc. T he 4x I 00-
meter relay - made up of Blue, 
Holiday, junior Aileen Sabio and 
freshman Amber Green - earned 
a second-place finish with a time 
of 48.01, 0.23 seconds away from 
breaking the school record. 

On the men's side, juniors Jon 
Patton and Mike Cunningham 
posted NCAA provisional qualify-
ing times for the IIO-meter hur-
dles. Coming in after two USC 
rU/1l1ers, Patton and Cunningham 
finished third and fourth , respec-
tively, posting times of 14.73 and 
14.7S. Patton also earned a third-
place finish in the 400-meter hur-
dles, an event in which he previ-
ously held the meet rt!cord, with a 
time of 53.59, trailing the second-
place finisher by O. IS seconds. 

Senior Kevin Beeman also 
stood out from the crowd with his 
high jump mark of 6-8, the second-
best height ever achieved by a 
Triton. For the throwing events, 
junior Brad Ubuit po ted a second-
place throw for the javelin with a 
mark of S7.02 meters. The men's 

War of insults costs 
NHL more than money 

Cyn \1:11. '~y;'1 '~//'" ! ' . ,7., ~ /:/ 
Cynthia Blade Chavez 

F eb. 16,2005 was an ordinary winter day for most people in this country. But for our 
neighbors to the north and to a 
few diehard hockey fans in the 
United States, it was the war t 
day in hockey hi story when NHL 
Commissioner Ga ry Bettman 
announced the ca nce ll ation of the 
2004-05 season. 

Despite having more than a 
year to reach a coll ective bargain-
ing agreement, neither the owners 
nor players were willing to make a 
deal to salvage the already short-
ened season. 

What disgusts me is that neither 
side seems the least bit remorseful 
about the cancellation. It 's just 
been a nasty war of insults between 
the NHL Players Association's 
Executive Director Bob 
Goodenow on one side and 
Benman and NHL Executive Vice 
President Bill Daly on the other. 
Meanwhile, the athletes are either 
playing golf somewhere sunny or 
hockey in other leagues. 

A year ago, Arthur Levin, for-
mer chairman of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, reported 
that the NHL lost $273 million in 

revenue during the 2002-03 season. 
However, in its Nov. 29 issue, 
Forbes magazine sa id the league lost 
$123 million - that's $I SO million 
less than what Levitt reported. 

O n the other hand, the players 
arc enjoyi ng 75 percent share of 
the league's revenue, the highest 
among baseball, basketball and 
foo tbal l. T hese guys aren't hurting 
either. At thi s point, all that seems 
to matter is money, not the in tegri -
ty of the game or the fans. 

Both sides are to blame for this 
mess, and to be honest, I don't know 
if the NHL will ever recover from 
it. The players and owners are so 
hellbent on keeping their pockets 
full of millions that they are willing ' 
to throw the league away. They 
must know that hockey is a distant 
last when it comes to popularity 
among the four major sports, so 
why quit now? 

In addition, owners and play-
ers know that 30 teams arc too 
many, ticket prices are too high 
and that the seats just aren't filling 
up. They still have to wrestle with 
the issue of violence, especially 
with Todd Bertuzzi of the 
Vancouver Canucks pl ead ing 
guilty to assault charges earlier 
this year. Tn 2004, Bertuzzi sucker 
punched Colorado Avalanche 
.steve Moore from behind, break-
ing his neck, jaw and giving him a 
concussion. Scoring has dropped 
and many are complaining that the

Getting warm: The 2005 Triton track 
and field season is underway after the 
Feb. 25 Rossi Relays. 
4xl00-meter relay - consisting of 
junior CJ Lawrence and Matt 
Borzage, freshman Todd 
Bettisworth, sophomore Alex 
Hesselgesser - finished second 
with a time of 42.68, trailing first-
place finisher USC by two seconds. 
The 4x400-meter relay - made of 
Bettisworth, Cunningham, 
Borzage and sophomore Dan Noel 
- finished fourth at the Rossi 
Relays, and earned higher distinc-
tion by posting the sixth-fastest 
time in UCSD history. 

The Rossi Relays was the first 
meet for both teams this season, as 
the annual Blue/Gold Alumni meet 
was canceled due to rain. The sea-
son will continue on March 5 at the 
All-California Championships at 
UC Irvine. The Tritons' next home 
meet will be the San D iego City 
C hampionships, to be held on 
March 12.

Senior Staff Writer 

After heavy rainfa ll caused 
matches on Feb. 17 at Loyola 
Maryrnount and Feb. 20 at UC 
Riverside to be postponed, the No. 
10 Triton men's tennis team sprung 
back into action, sweeping its Feb. 
25 through Feb. 27 homestand at 
the Northview Tennis Courts. 
UCSD (4- 1) opened its weekend 
gauntlet against No. 27 Hawaii-
Hilo, winning what would become 
the Tritons' closest match of the 
weekend, in a 7-2 victory. The previ-
ously undefeated Colorado School 
of Mines and NCAA West Regional 
opponent Sonoma State didn't fare 
as well as the Vulcans, as both teams 
were destroyed, 9-0, by UCSD on 
Feb. 26 and Feb. 27, respectively. 

On the third day of match play, 
the Tritons blanked Sonoma State 
(1-3), 9-0, extending their current 
winning streak to four straight victo-
ries. The Tritons jumped into the 
lead early, winning all three doubles 
matches right off the bat, before 
going into singles play. 

"Sonoma didn't go down easy, 
pushing the No. 1 and No. 3 doubles 
to 8-6," head coach Eric Steidlmayer 
said. "[The SeawolvesJ gave us aU we 
could want at No. 1 and No. 3." 

The Tritons' young talent 
showed through during match play; 
highlights of the singles matchups 
included freshmen Erie Rubens and 
Blake Meister, at No. 4 and No. 6, 
respectively, both winning their 
matches, 6-0, 6-0. At the No. 3 spot, 
sophomore Seth Spector held off his 
opponent, finishing his match in a 
close 7 -6, 6-5 victory. 

"Dunior No. 2J Brent Molden 
really played a solid match," 
Steidl mayer said. "Not many errors, 
some big forehands, serves and some 

stronger backhands were too much 
for the Sonoma player." 

On Feb. 26, the second day of the 
challenge, the men faced an unde-
feated Colorado School of Mine 
team, which was S-O going into the 
match. As rain clouds filled the sky 
and threatened the match, the 
Tritons seemed to be racing the 
weather and handed the Orediggers 
their first loss. 

"Our players were more confi-
dent and it showed," Steidlmayer 
said. 

The Tritons gave up a total of 
eight games in all three doubles 
matches combined. Both the No. I 
doubles team, made up of Molden 
and Spector, and the No. 2 team of 
senior captain Bryan Swatt and 
Rubens, were able to defeat their 
opponents, 8-3, while Meister and 
junior Erik Oijala gave up only two 
games in an -2 defeat over 
Colorado's Ben Dunn and Jordan 
Revielle at No. 3 doubles. 

"Swatt played noticeably well in 
defeating their solid o. I," 
Steidl mayer said. "He routined a guy 
that isn't easy to defeat. Overall we 
played solidly, and it was a good win 
for our club." 

The Tritons also had very little 
trouble in the singles line-up, with 
No. 1 Swatt defeating Colorado's 
Matt Rychlik, 6-2, 6-3, while No.2 
Molden outmaneuvered his oppo-
nent for a 6-1, 6-4 victory. No. 3 
Spector defeated Colorado's Almed 
Sejaiti by a score of 6-1, 6-0. 

Oijala, playing at o. 4, played 
an excellent first set, blanking his 
opponent, 6-0, and closing the 
match with a 6-4 second set. At N o. 
5, Meister defeated Revielle, 6-2, 
6-3, and fres hman Will Phan 
defeated Dunn in a short 6-2, 6-1.

UCSD starts strong, then falters 
Water polo drops four to ranked teams 

By DANIEL DIAl 
Senior Staff Writer 

For the second time this season, 
the No. 15 UCSD women's water 
polo team opened a tournament 
with a convincing victory only to 
drop the rest of their slate, earning 
a ISth-place fini sh at the Gaucho 
Invitational, held at UC Santa 
Barbara from Feb. 25 to Feb 27. 
The Tri tons charged out of the gate 
with a 7-5 triumph over University 
of Pacific before falling short in 
losses to No. 3 Stanford, No. 6 
Indiana, No. 16 UC Irvine and No. 
19 Princeton. 

The 1-4 performance now 
leaves UCSD at 3-9 on the season. 
With 18 of this year's 23 competi-
tors nationally ranked, the Gaucho 
Invitational is considered one of the 
showcase tournaments for colle-
giate water polo and, for UCSD, a 
prime opportunity to tangle with 
some top-caliber teams. 

Unfortunately, the Tritons con-
tinued their losing skid to ranked 
squads, recording their 10th con-
secutive setback to a top-20 oppo-
nent wi th a 5 -1 loss to Princeton on 
Feb. 27 . The Tritons' tournament 
finish paralleled their performance 
at the UCSD Arena Invitational on 
Feb. 5 and Feb. 6, when they 
knocked off Hartwick for their lone 
win over a ranked team this season, 
only to fal l to the rest of their oppo-
nents. 

"The weekend was tough," 

Kaia 
Frenzy: Sophomore two-meter Natalie Hockett (right front) and the Tritons 
finished the Gaucho Invitational 1-4, including a win over University of Pacific. 
UCSD head coach Larry Sanders 
said. "We struggled with scoring, 
and it showed that we need to do 
some better work. As a coach, I 
need to better explain the concepts 
and formations we run in the pool." 

But the poor record couldn't 
overshadow the exhibition of depth 
in the UCSD offense. Ten players 
notched goals for the Tritons over 
the three-day competition, includ-
ing senior driver Courtney 
Clevenger who had four points. 
Senior utility Tobi Lyman was right 
behind with three scores of her 
own, and senior Jessica Wong near-
ly dismantled Pacific on her own 
with a Feb. 25 hat-trick against the 
TIgers. 

On the strength of its offense, 

UCSD rolled out to a quick 3-0 
advantage by the end of the open-
ing frame. But the outburst could-
n't tranquilize the TIgers, who 
struck back with two quick goals at 
the beginning of the second quarter 
to cut the lead to one. 

However, the Tritons would 
prnit three more goals in the third 
frame to stave off any comebacks 
from Pacific. The defense con-
tributed to the effort by holding 
Mountain Pal:ific Sports 
Federation scoring leader Jessica 
Schroder off the score sheet. 
Clevenger scored a pair of goals 
while Lyman and sophomore utili-
ty Michelle Perkins each added a
