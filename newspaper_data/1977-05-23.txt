UCSD Student Runs for Council 

Anthony Gonzales, a UCSD student, last week declared his can-
didacy for the San Diego City CoWlcil position which represents UCSD. 

Gonzales, who ran for ASUCSD president last r:nonth, is a member of 
the campus chapters of the Chicano organization MEChA, the 
National Student Coalition Against Racism and the Young Socialist 
Alliance. He will seek the nonpartisan cOWlcil seat against incumbent 
Gil Johnson as a representative of the Socialist Workers' Party. 

In a statement released Wednesday, Gonzales said two of his major 
issues are the deportation of undocumented workers and school 
desegregation. Gonzales said he " opposes all deportations, as they 
violate the basic human and civil rights of undocumented workers. 
The real creator of unemployment is not Wldocumented workers but 
the capitalist ~ystem. 

Gonzales alSO said he supports "busing and an expansion of 
bilingual and bicultural programs as first steps toward achieving 
school desegregation." 

UC Bargaining Bill Approved 
A collective bargaining bill for California Wliversities and colleges 

was pased last week by the Assembly public employees and 
retirement committee, but only after language providing for student 
involvement in the bargaitiing process was deleted from the bill. 

AB 1()91-authored by Assemblyman Howard Berman (D-Beverl~y 
Hills)-proposes extension of bargaining rights now enjoyed by state 
public school and community college staff to include UC and state 
college and university employees. 

The bill originally included a section that provided for student in-
volvement as non-voting representatives at the bargaining table. 
Among those voting to remove the student section was Republican 
William Cr~ven, whose Assembly district includes UCSD. 

Despite this vote, the American Federation of Teachers, which 
strongly supports the measure, has informed the UC Student Lobby it 
is confident student representation will be included in the final version 

of the bill which will be the one to reach Gov. Brown's desk: 
The bill now goes to the Assembly ways and means conunittee. 

Pressing Need for Body Parts in San Diego 

Students Attack UC Investments 
Demonstrat~ Staged at Regents' Meeting Last Week 

by Larry Sterne 
Daily Cal Staff Writer 

SAN FRANCISCO-In response 
to angry demonstrators at last 
Thursday's meeting of the UC 
Board of Regents here, five 
members of the board agreed to 
meet with the demonstrators to 
discuss the University's in-
vestment policy with corporations 
doing business in South Africa. 

About 50 members of the 
Revolutionary Student Brigade 
and other groups opposed to UC 
investment policy stormed the 
Regents committee meeting and 
staged a tense, but peaceful con-
frontation with several Regents 
including UC President David 
Saxon. 

The group, which demanded t~t 
UC devest itself of these in-
vestments, left the meeting room 
at the UC Extension center when 
the Regents agreed to meet with its 

representatives next Tuesday at 
1: 30 pm in Pauley Ballroom on the 
Berkeley campus. 

In addition, at their general 
meeting Friday, the Regents 
authorized UCSD to proceed with 
architectural plans for the 
$3,647,000 building program to 
construct Third College, Unit 2. 

(The Regents' vote indicated 
confidence that state funds for Unit 
2-which will allow space for Third 
administrative office, additional 
classrooms and faculty offices-
will be approved by the state 
Legislature. The Senate finance 
conunittee is expected to consider 
the proposal which has been ap-
proved by the Assembly ways and 
means committee, this week.) 

The Regents who agreed to meet 
with the protesters were : Board 
chairperson William Coblentz, 
Gregory Bateson, Alumni 
representative Earl Willens, 

~ 

student Regent Daryn Peeples and 
Regent Designate Charles Fields. 

The demonstrators were 
crowded in the front of the 
auditorium. They cheered loudly 
and stamped their feet when it was 
announced that some of the 
Regents would talk with them next 
week 

Group Chants 
Led by Brigade member Matt 

Gutman, the group chanted "the 
people united will never be 
defeated" and then peacefully left 
the auditorium. 

The confrontation began about 10 
minutes after the demonstrators 
filed quietly into the meeting room. 

Some Regents left the room 
immediately. Others, including 
Saxon, tried to talk to the group. 

Saxon tried to explain that he 
favored some changes in the 
University investment policy, but 
he was shouted down by Gutman 
and others. 

"You stand side by side with all 
the rest of these guys (on the UC 
Board of Regents)," Gutman told 

., them. 
Saxon responded with, "A notion 

that not investing in Ford is going 
to stop apartheid is ridi.culous." 
The President then left the 
auditorium as the protesters 

II> chanted "Regents are the tool of 8 the rich man's rule." 
'r ~ Student Regent Peeples, who 

~ stayed in the auditorium during the 
iii confrontation, said she believed 

~ such demonstrations only help to 
a alienate the Regents.

"A Gift of Life" -Organ Donor Transplants Discussed 
by Alan Russell 

News Editor 
It's a matter of giving life after your death. 
At least that was the message prominently put forth last 

Thursday evening at University Hospital in a fonun 
sponsored by the "Donated Organ Program" of San Diego 
County. . 

The program centered itself around two main thrusts, 
that of the desperate need for corneas, kidneys and skin, 
and also the future hopeful formation of a coordinated 
organ donor transplant center for San Diego county. 

The forum concerned itself with educating the audience 
as to the "entire process" of organ donation-from the steps 
individuals need to take before death to the proceedings 
that follow afterwards. Slides and demonstration models 
were used to further the various speakers thrusts. 

Dr. Hugh Frank, Director of Upiversity Hospital's Burn 
Unit, said that, "At the present time there is no substitute 
for someone else's skin." 

Frank detailed "skin transplant" operations, saying that 
skin taken from a donor returned to "normal'- after six 
months. He also stated that open casket funerals could still 
be performed for cadavers as the "skin taken is coverid by 
clothes." 

Not Enoap SkiD 
"The gift of skin after death can give life," said Frank. 

"We never have enough skin for the 200 burn patients every 
year in the San Diego area." 

Dr. Perry S. Binder, Alsiatant ProfellOr of Opthalmology 
at the UCSD School of Medicine, emphasized that the 
"pubUc needs to be educated to the good their organs can 
do." 

Binder stated openly, "You're not going to use them 
(organs) after you die." 

Stressing the need for a coordinated organ program in 
San Diego, Binder noted ita many benefits, not the leal of 
which would be "ealier lnfonnation access for perplexed 
doctors," 

"Physicians have guilt feelings about asking the relatives 
permission for use of the deceased's organs," said Binder. 
"Even upon receiving permission to use the organs the 
doctor often doesn't know who to call, or isn't sure of 
current transplant information or questions of the like. 

"Having a centralized phone number that could give 
them such information would help greatly." 

Binder estimated basic costs for institution of the

program to be from $30,000 to $40,000, with $20,000 needed 
annually afterwards. 

Binder also gave an extensive history of the use of cor-
neas in transplants, and with slides showed the delicate 
operation, complete with the size of the sutures used on a 
human eye-on tenth the thickness of a hair. 

"We need corneas," .. lei Binder. "The only way we can 
get them is from humans. The name of the game is to 
get them here right d th and transplant them within 
four days." 

Th d plig" of kldney disease patients was detailed by 
Mikki Ma ller, Kidney TranIplant Coordinator at 

University Hospital. She described the "pain" of those who 
have to be "purged" on the hem<Klialysis machines, and 
how they must undergo such treatment four to six hours 
daily three times a week. 

"The alternative to dialysis is a kidney transplant," said 
Masteller. "Someone who is willing to give the gift of life. A 
cadaver can help two people-we transplant one kidney per 
per on." 

Masteller pointed out that there are between 1500 and 2200 
people waiting for kidneys every month, and that the longer 
anyone waits, " the more difficult it is for transplants. " This 
occurs because patients undergoing dialysis form anti-
bodies which will attack foreign tissues, often resulting in 
rejection of the newly implanted kidneys. 

The sad reality of the situation of "those who wait" was 
heard by one kidney patient. "It's hard," she said. " I 
rejected my father's kidney in June. I just wait, my name 
on a nationwide computer kidney 'search' system." 

The Frustration - All Around 
Frustration is seen on all sides by the CU1'1'ent plight in 

San Diego for organs-presently there's no skin, corneas or 
kidneys in "banks," and few huve been coming in for th 
past year. 

Pat Viviano of the Skin Bank expressed her anger of the 
situation, saying, "I'm disgustec.. I just finished calling all 
the hospitals in the city asking them for skin . I felt like 
telling them it doesn't matter how much money you have-if 
y u're in a car accident,..... , .. â¢ 
nothing you can do without other's kin. Currently e hay 
none." 

The pleas are out. CurrenUy, through the hard or of

Open Letter to Dr. i\1cE1 roy Commerfary 
, Review Reg Fee Priorities Consult Grad Students 

On Feb. 15,1977, you sent me a memo stating, "1\ is UCSDs practice to 
consult the Graduate Student Council in connection with graduate 
student representation on conunlttees." This practice is formalized at 
the level of policy by section IN of the Polley and Procedure Manual 
(revision Issued under your signature on December 28,1976). Although 
the Search Committee for the Vice-chanceUor of Student . Affairs 
position has been formed and has met, the Graduate Student Council

by PetcrScluaelder 
The demand upon the ~.5 million 

Registration he has clearly ex-
ceeded the available funding 
source. What happens now? '!be 
Reg Fee Committee seems to think 
the solution is to increase the fee 
paid by students. Next year the fee 
is up to $360 annually and the year 
after that odWi are the level will hit 
a high of $392. 

during summer break to pay . for 
the same education. 

Wben will the increases stop? 

Students pay reg fee and reg fee 
pays for most of student affairs. If 
any other state funded department 
on campus spent more than their 
budget, programs would be 
redesigned to be cost effective, or 
cut. '!be difference is that the state 
will not at times increase the 
operating budget for a state funded 
department. The student affairs 
department paid for students can 
force students to pay more: 

The committee seems to think that 
students have bottomless pockets 
filled with ready cash. Students 
will be working twice as hard 

Instead of taking a cost effective 
management approach, the fee

level is increased. 
Reg fee is coUected to fund 

services for students with 
programs which provide for 
cultural, physical and social needs. 
Since when did service mean 
hiring expensive administrators? 
Service should be defined in terms 
of the actual benefits students 
receive. 

1bis campus is incredibly top 
heavy with administrators and 
staff support directly funded by 
students. The Reg Fee Committee 
sll>uld conduct an immediate 
comprehensive audit to, identify 
administrators with over-
classified positions. 

The question we should be asking 
is .... What's the cheapest way to get 
the same job done? The $20,000 
salary of one administrator can 
buy an enormous number of in-
terns and workers with lots of 
energy but fewer professional 
degrees. 

A review of recent reg fee 
allocations shows that we need a 
new set of priorities. Reg fee 
should fund high student in-
volvement programs first, 
essential services, second. Last on 
the list should be the ad-
ministrators. 

Take a look at how the Reg Fee 
Corrunitlee operates. The student 
majority is divided by lld-
ministrators who are defending 
their empires. Student committee 
members are inundated with in-
formation and then pressured into 
making decisions favorable to 
administrators in a climate of 
sypthetic crises. 

When was the last time this 
conunittee thought to make a 
survey of what students think? 
Maybe the studenis compelled to 
pay exorbitant fees should be 
asked what they are willing to pay 
for. I'll admit the operation of the 
reg fee process is complex, but 
when was the last time the student 
conunittee members turned to the 
college councils to give in-
formation and to ask advice? 

'Ibis breach of established protocol could be an oversight, but in-
fonnal contacts with the responsible parties and your office seem to 
indicate that it is not. If this is true, it is an affront which deserves an 
immediate apology. At the very least, I think that you owe the Graduate 
Student Council the courtesy of a fonnal explanation and I request that 
such an explanation be delivered to me (c/o the Office of Graduate 
Studies and Research) within three days. 

Let me point out that in ignoring the official and recopized 
representative mechanism for graduate students, you are running the 
risk of making jl farce out of the Search Committee. Student Affairs is 
concerned with the non-academic activities of all students, and is 
funded largely through Registration Fees paid by undergraduate 
students and graduate students alike. Consequently, fonnal 
representation of all students, through the estab1isbed mechanisms, is 
required if the search is to have any validity. 

It should have been obvious that graduate students (far more than 
faculty or provosts, for example) have a major and vested interest in 
student affairs. They pay for and use all of the facilities and services 
provided, Including Student Health, Counseling, Recreational and 
Intercollegiate Athletics, Campus Program BolIrd activities, 
publications of the Communications Board, the International Center, 

. the Student Center, Financial Aids. 
Graduate students have pareUel representation wIth undergraduates 

on aU advisory committees concerned with student affairs functions, 
and in the past have been included on Search Conunittees for students 
affairs personnel (e.G. Career Planning and Placement). '!be graduate 
student constituency is not adequately represented by undergraduates 
or administrators, which has long been fonnaUy recognized. 

To arbitrarily reverse this in the Search Committeefortheperson who 
will determine the course of student affairs for the next several years is 
to deliberately disenfranchise one fifth of the student population. 

Unless you intend to couple this disenfranchisement with a permanent 
graduate student exemption ftom paying Registration Fees, the 
Graduate Student Council must regard the Search Committee as 
currenUy constituted to be illegal, and all actions taken by it to have no 
force . 

When this is pointed out to the university community, it will be very 
difficult for any new Vice-chanceUor to asswne his duties W;ith any 
degree of credibility. Therefore, by copy of this letter, I am asking all 
members of the Search Committee to refuse to serve until graduate 
students are properly and fonnally represented. 

Such representation must be arranged through the Graduate Student 
Council, either by an ex..officio appointment of the chair to the com-
mittee, or by a request for a representative according to the procedures 
specified in the Policy and Procedure Manual .. Unless I am informed 
otherwise, within a three day period, I will assume that this indiCates 
agreement with the points I have raised and implies a request for the 
Graduate Student Council to proceed with an appointment to theSearch 
Conunittee. Sincerely,

friday 

Dear Doc: What are the little 
orange and red triangles that are 
placed near the bottom of the front 
of several rooms arouod campus? 
To tell us which side goes up? 

Yes. They also are the work of a 
government official whose job it is 
to go around to classrooms in 
colleges all across the nation and 
paint these little triangles to 
designate the placement of the 
rows of chairs. Now, you may 
wonder why someone from the fire 
marshall's office doesn't just set 
limits for each room on the number 
of chairs allowed. I asked them 
this, and was told the colorful 
triangles serve asjust as efficient 
a warning against overcrowding 
the classrooms, in addition to 
specifying the width of tbe 
firelanes. The reason the triangles 
are nol in every room on campus is 
so that the registrar's office still 
has plenty of other classrooms to 
overerowd. 

Dear Doc: Why was that big 
cement lab on the west side 01 the 

Muir tennis courts put there? 
If you will look carefully, you will 

notice the slab is the same cheery 
color as the Muir donns. This is no 
accident, for the slab was built 
before the dorms so the architects 
could get an idea of how the donns 
would look. Apparently, they likcd 
what they saw. Thus the color of 
the Muir dorms is no accident-it 
was carefully worked out ~ead of 
time by highly paid architects and 
engineers. All color blind. The slab 
currently serves as a monolithic 
prayer stone for those students 
who keep hoping that one day they 
will find an empty tennis court 
there. 

Dear Doc: In tbe receat 
calculator coatest sponsored by the 
bookstore, were prizes ever given 
away? U so, who received them? 

According to a source In the 
bookstore, the give-away contest 
was a tremendous success. It is 
now being discussed among the 
bookstore hierareby to use this 
same method to determine who 

gets the books when too few books 
are ordered for a class. In fact, I 
have been assured thar this will 
always be the case for any classes 
taught by Political Science 
professor Peter Cowey until he 
realizes _ that for every student 
enrolled in one of his courses he 
must convince two others to also 
sign up for the class. This way, out 
of the one third that really remain 
in the class past the first week, 
only about 5% of them won't be 
able to get the books. 

In the recent calculator contest, 
an HP-25 was Biven to Michael 
Stafford of Muir College, and a TI-
56 was given to Revelle . College 
student Melissa L. (for lucky) 
Wall. I'd like to thank Melissa for 
submitting her question to me. 

Dear Doc: Why is the Ught 10 the 
middle of the HL celilog Ol1lage-
and not yellow like the rest? 
Signed, Daydreamer. 

I was told by one source the 
orange light is a remnant of a 1968 

psychology experiment to see how 
many students would notice the 
odd light. According to the latest 
data available from the 
Psychology Department, 22 
students have thus far noticed the 
orange light. and were curious 
enough to inquire as to why. The 
student who began the experiment 
is now finishing his doctorate 
thesis on the use of libraries as a 
cure for insomnia. I guess he 
decided to switch to a topic with a 
larger data base. 

On the other hand, llbrary of-
ficials claim the light was merely 
part of a series of bulb tests to 
improve the night illumination in 
the library. The orange bulb was 
found to be inferior to the yellow 
bulbs, but n( one felt like going to 
the trouble to take it out.

Musical Comedy from the 60s 
IIClear Day" Sparkles Downtown 

by Margaret Hewey 
Staff Writer 

U you go downtown to the Hotel San Diego, you can 
find "8 little bit of Vegas" in the baselllent. This is 
where the Broadway Dinner Theatre buzzes with 
constant entertainment-everything from opening 
Vaudeville acts, to a musical feature, and after-show 
entertainment. 

The main attraction this month is "On a Clear Day 
You Can See Forever," an interesting blend ci 
romance, comedy, ESP and reincarnation set to 
music. 

Act I gets off to a rousing start with the entire cast 
circled around the tables singing the overture, "On a 
Clear Day" with a quadrophonic-like effect. 

Then on-stage we are introduced to the wacky, 
chain-smoking, Brooklyn-accented star-Daisy 
Gambol (Connie Danese). She accidentally gets 
hypnotized in her psych class while her professor, Dr. 
Mark Bruckner (Scot Stewart) hypnotizes another 
student. 

This of course leads to the beginning of a 
relationship between Daisy and the Doc. Mter 
snapping her out of hypnosis, Dr. Bruckner discovers 
that Daisy has extra. sensory perception because she 
knows when the phone is going to ring, where lost 
pieces of paper are, etc. 

As if this isn't enough, we also learn that Daisy had 
another life in the past (during another hypnosis 
session with the doctor in order to stop smoking) . The 
gabby, Brooklyn-accented Daisy Gambol of New 
York City (1965) suddenly transfonns into the well-
bred, English-accented Melinda Welles of London 
(1794 ) . 

Throughout this session, Melinda reveals the story 
of her romance with her protrait-painter, Edward 
Moncrief (Jason Stearns). Meanwhile. Dr. 
Bruckner's fascination increases for this 18th 
century mystery girl and he encourages Daisy to 
come to more hypnosis sessions. 

Classifieds 

More complications arise as Daisy becomes 
smitten with the Doctor and blows up when she 
discovers that he's more interested in Melinda, her 
"other self." 

By the end of the play, however, the problems get 
ironed out and Daisy and Mark live happily ever 
after. . 

Although the plot seems a little hokey,. this Alan Jay 
LernerlBurton Lane musical is a lot of fun to watcb-
especially live. Watching CoNde Danese belt out 
some of these songs with seemingly boundless energy 
and pizazz is a treat. 

Although no one can really compare to Streisand's 
Daisy Gambol in the movie version, Danese shows a 
lot of capability in her protrayaI. (Although her voice 
inflections and gestures often resembled Streisan-
sand's. ) She handles comedy and singirlg very well. 

Scot Stewart was alSo fine as Dr. Bruckner. He 
certainly sang a lot better than Yves Montand ever 
did in the movie version. (Although Montand's 
charisma can't be beat. ) 

In fact, the chemistry of the entire cast really 
works in the whole musical-their closeness can be 
clearly sensed. This production makes for great 
entertainment-it's funny, the tunes are witty and the 
cast gushes with energy. 

The Pre Show is also amusing-"Those Wonderful 
Days of Vaudeville." Here the Broadway Toppers 
(the waiters and waitresses who also happen to be 
drama and music majors at colleges and universities 
throughout San Diego County) get a chance to display 
their talents. And Sherman the Magician also puts on 
his magic show. 

The Broadway Dinner Theatre seems to be the only 
place in town where such entertainment can be had 
along with buffet dinner as well as valet parking. All 
and all a pretty good package deal considering all the 
treats in store.
