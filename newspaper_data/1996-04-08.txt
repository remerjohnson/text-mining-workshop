BERKELEY, Calif. - The 
man FBI officials suspect is the 
infamous Unabomber was an 
assistant math professor at UC 
Berkeley from 1967 to 1969. 
Theodore Kaczynski, 53, was 
taken into custody at his . 
Lincoln, Mon!., home early last 
week. The Unabomber, so 
named because of his history of 
initially targeting university 
professors and airline execu· 
tives, is believed to be respon-
sible for 16 bombings over the 
last 17 years. Officials first 
began to suspect Kaczynski 
after family members discov-
ered several manuscripts he had 
written containing similar ideas 
to those in the Unabomber's 
manifesto.

Future of 
Supercomputer 
Center Funding 
Uncertain 
VENTURE: UCSD-GA split 
on upcoming NSF proposal 
may jeopardize center's future 
By Mary Higgins 
Staff Writer 

Mounting tensions between UCSD and San 
Diego-based General Atomics (GA), which to-
getheroperate the San Diego SupercomputerC n-
ter (SDSC), may place the center' future funding 
and its very exi tence in jeopardy_ 

The center,located nextto RIMAe;: at the north 
end of campu ,is involved in a heated'competition 
for a new National ciencc Foundation (NSF) 
program, Partnerships for Advan ed Computa-
tionalInfrastru ture (PACI). PA I i de igned to 
promote cooperation between nadonal computa-
tional research center , CSD Vice Chancell r of 
Research Richard Attiyeh said. 

SDS is operated and staffed by GA, while the 
center's facilities arc located on U SO property. 

UCSD wasonginally supposed to take the lead 
in ajoint preliminary proposal, although Attiyeh 
said administrators expected GA to continueoper-
atingSDSC'ssucce oroncePACltakeseffectin 
1998. 

The center's atmosphere IS "tense," accordi ng 
to one SDSC employee, because of aggressive 
competition for continuing funding and the ap-
proaching April 15 NSF deadline for preliminary 
PACI proposals. 

Whi Ie PACI emphasizes partnerships and con-
joined efforts between scientific facilitie , SDSC 
employees often refer to the center as a commu-
nity resource. 

SDSC Founding Director Sid Karin, who led 
the center until his departure last November, is 
often credited with helping to e tablish SDSC's 
strong tics with the San Diego community. 

SDSC' past successes have often been attrib-
uted to these partnership , which provide the 
organization with its financial and human re-
sources. 

However, GA Vice Chainnan Linden Blue e-
mailed UCSD Senior Vice Chancellor of Aca-
demic Affairs Robert Dynes on March 13 to 
declare GA's intent to break off the partnership. 
. "Our assumption has always been that GA 
would remain a full partner with UCSD, befitting 
GA's leadership, [yet] we have see your percep-
lion of the role for GA in the new proposal 
constantly declining," the e-mail letter stated.

A.S. Constitutional Amendments Would Restructure Council 
REFERENDA: 
Measures sponsored 
by U.N.I. T.E. slate 
By EstlMtr Yoon 
Staff Writer 

Along with electing new A.S. 
officers for the 1996-97 academic 
year during this week's elections, 
students will also cast their votes on 
two constitutional referenda which, 
if passed, would reshape the inter-
nal structure of the A.S. to model it 

after the U.S. federal government. 
"Constitutional Amendment A" -

co-authored by A.S. Vice President 
Administrative Jennifer Nicoll; Vice 
President Finance Edmondo 
Robinson; and Student Advocate 
Souley Diallo- seeks to restructure 
the current A.S. Constitution into a 
"checks and balances" system. 

The new constitution would de-
lineate the A.S. Council's supervi-
sion of student funds and activities 
into executive, legislative and judi-
cial branches. It would also em-

power the legislative branch, which 
includes college senators and a sen-
ate speaker, by increasing the num-
ber of senators from each college 
from four to five. 

Under the proposed constitution, 
the executive branch of the A.S. 
Council would include the presi-
dent, vice preside·nt of internal af-
fairs, vice president of external af-
fairs and vice president of financial 
affairs. The three vice presidents 
would head respective internal, ex-
ternal and financial departments, as 

-.. 

well as appoint commissioner of-
fices . 

Within the executive branch, the 
new constitution would strip author-
ity from commissioner position , 
which wou ld no longer be elected and 
would lose voting privileges within 
A.S. Council. Commi ioner office 
would function under the oversight of 
their respective departments. 

The amendment would also cre-
ate several new commissioner posi-
tions- including a director of affairs

'The new document., as a whole. 
makes the system less bureaucratic," 
Robinson said. "Before we started 
rewriting the current constitution Fall 
Quarter, people on A.S. Council had 
known that it needed to be done." 

"I came into it when I wanted to 
rewrite the financial by-laws for the 
finance office, and realized howdiffi-
cult it was to amend any part of the 
constitution because of the way it is 
structured." Robinson added. "It is a 
large ta k to undertake. l3 task] which 
most councilmember~ weren' t will-

Robinson cited thl: urr~nt consti-

in the process." 
According to Robinson. the num-

ber of senators on the A.S. Couocil 
needs to be increased in order to 
completely .. represent the student 
body. 

"We thought senators should be 
the final check in the system. be-
cause they representcenainportions 
of campus, they should definitely be 
more involved in everything that's 
going on, they should approve ev-
erything." he said. 

Robinson also maintained the is-
sue of commissioner appointments 
as one of the primary concerns of the 
constitutional amendment. 

"Commissioners are elected. but 
they're not held accountable for rep-
re enting students. so we took away 
their voting privileges in this new 
con titution," Robinson said. ") rthi

"Senators are apathetic - they 
don't care about voting, projects. dis-

empowers them. gives them authority

Council and how it functions . [But] I 
don't think. that giving them more 
responsibility will make them more

"Amendability,"anotherdebatable 
issue within the new constitution, 
would be provided by a clause which 
passes amendments under a three-
fourths vote of the senale. 

'The ambiguity of this new consti-
tution is the best thing about it." 
Robinson said. "If the problems that 
people have with it now come up 
later, they can just be amended." 

However. A.S. President aomi 
Falk disagreed with the implications 
of an "ambiguous" structure. 

'That's n t a good point." Falk 
said. "Making the constitution amend-

Sario. in addressing the drafting of 
a new A.S. Constitution, felt that the 
process necessitated outside consul-
tation. 

"A lawyer should look over the 
drafting of a new constitution. Stu-
dents shouldn't be the ones to draft the 
constitution without some supervi-
sion; lawyers take care of the word-
ing, how concise or ambiguous it is," 
he said. 

"Students aren't really educated 
enough to judge these matters them-
selves," Sano added. 

"Constitutional Amendment .8."

UCSD Women's Lac~ 
Coach Falls From Clift' 
PWN.: Nancy 
Vesper remains at 
Scripps Hospital 
ByT.", Lew 
Associate News Editor 

Nancy Vesper. a 23·year-old 
UCSD alumnus and the cwrent coach 
of the UCSD women's lacrosse team, 
fell6S feet down a La lolls cljff in an 
apparent suicide attempt April 3. 

Vesper was rescued by lifeguards 
and laken to Scripps Memorial Hos-
pital, where she remains. 

Vesper suffered a "seriously frac-
tured hip" from her fall at the Emerald 
Cove, which San Diego Lifeguard Lt. 
Charlie Wright said is "a notorious 
jumping place." 

"She was apparently a little bit 
despondent and anemptcd to lake her 
life by jumping from the cliff," Wright 
said. "She fell 65 feet down the cljff 
and landed on the rocks below." 

( Wright added that Vesper was 
transponed to Scripps by paramedics 
"after a fairly technical rescue." 

"There really is no way to get to 
that particular cove other than by 
water," Wright said: "Lifeguards had 
to rappel down the cliff to get to her, 
and we had to bring a lifeguard and a 

pll'llDCdic in by boat. " 
AJthough Scripps officials would 

not relua any information about 
Vesper's condition, she was mo~ 
Friday from intensive care to a rqulIr 
palient area. 

Neither Vesper nor her mother 
would comment on the incident. 

Vesper graduated from Revelle 
College in 1995. She played on 
UCSO' s lacrosse team. and began 
coaching the team after graduation. 

"She [is) more like a teammaIe 
dian a coach," Warren senior Sabina 
Yun said. "She's a great person." 

According to UCSD Club Sports 
Director ScottBemdes, Vesper is well-
liked and is devoted to the lacrosse 
team. 

"She's prctty connected with all of 
us up here and wecenainly hope she's 
01(," Bemdes said. "After [falling), 
she had [paramedics I call over here to 
tell the team that she wasn't going to 
be at practice." 

The Emerald Cove has been the 
site of several past suicides. 

In the latest incident, two 18-year-
old twin brothers leapt on March 6 
from the same area as Vesper. They 
were pulled unconscious from the 
water and died three days later with-
out regaining consciousness.

Whale watc. tom oJJer a stunning opportunity to view the world's largest 
summo m_als in their environment 

he captain's name isn't Ahab; 
it's Bob. The boat isn't the 
Pequod; it's the San Diego. 
And the object of the search is 
not Moby Dick, as it is in 
Herman Melville's timeless 
novel, but rather a seafaring 
creature of similar stature and 
far greater temperament - the 

gray whale. 
Instead of being loaded with grimy 

old sea hands garbed in tattered rags, 
the craft in this adventure is filled with 
ruddy-faced tourists, many wearing 
sweatshirts and Bermuda shOltS. In 
place of harpoons, they grasp Kodak 
cameras, which they hope will capture 
the fleeting image of the gentle giants 
frolicking in their private domain. 

This is whale watching, the closest 
thing to whaling in the United States. 
In its time. whaling was a major indus-
try. yet it hardly compares to what the 
wha)e..watching industry has become. 
In fact, since 1946. when the hunting 
of gray whales was banned in the 
United States, the affiliation has chID.,.. markedly. There is a lat more 
lIlODey to ...... ~ ,..

Where once a few thousand sailors

their titanic bodies, some foUr million 
people now spend more than $300 
million a year in 30 countries to 

• 

observe the great sea mammals in their 
naIuraI habitat. Just what is it about 
these marine behemoths that make 
them so fascinating to the teeming 
hordes of whale watchers? 

"People can't always see a whale 
easily," chuckled Ray, Bob's flfSt mate 
on the San Diego. Dressed in shorts, 
sandals and a T-shirt, he has learned a 
lot about the gray whales from his 
observations as an expidition leader 
for the Seaforth Sportsfishing Co. 

"They don ' t have them at Sea 
World," he added. 

Indeed, these seafar-
ing monstrosities can-
not be readily viewed 
at local marine parks or 
aquariums, and it's not 
difficult to figure out why. Not many 
tanks are capable of holding a creature 
40 to 4S feet in length - never mind 
that they can weigh up to 35 tons. 

And while they can usually be 
viewed from lookout points on shore 
with a pair of binoculars, notbing can 
match the excitement and intimacy of 
going out into their environment and 
observing them fIom just a few yards 
away. 

Such is the lure of whale watching, 
an industry lIlat originated in San 
Diego, where natwA1ist-led tours took 
place as far back as 1959. Today the 
industry thrives here more than ever, 
and the area has become a hub of sorts 

for whale watchers. The gray whales 
annually file past this area during the 
winter en route to mating and calving 
lagoons in Baja California. The migra-
tion is one of the longest and most 
famous of any mammal. 

"Some of the mating is done while 
they're on migration," Ray said. "They 
give birth down in the wanner waters 
so their calves will survive. Then they 
head back up to the Bering Sea, where 
they spend most of their summer 
months." 

Southern California, and especially 
San Diego, is a great loca-

tion to view the North 
American gray whaJe 

population. They 
migrate close to shore, 

using landmarks like La lolla and 
Coronado Island to help in navigation, 
according to Ray. 

The San Diego, a 75-foot-long plank 
boat built for fishing, is just one of the 
many water craft that explore the coast 
between the months of December and 
April, during the heart of the big gray-
whale season. Holding up to 118 pe0-
ple, it's usually full, especially on 
weekends. 

As it disembarks from its snug dock 
port at Seaforth Sportfishing on this 
particular Tuesday afternoon with its 
89 passengers, it is easy to conjure up 
some romantic feeling of adventure

Spring Rush 1996 
A New Approach to 

Sorority Rush 
Wby Should I Join? 
A. TbeaYel1lpp-eekGPAIl 

bllher thaa the 
IdIooI meaD. 

Fraternity Rush 
Fraternity rush begins on 

Wednesday, April 5th with info 
night at 6:30 PM in the Price Center 
Ballrooms. Delegates from Inter-
Fraternity Council as well as each 
fraternity will be present during 
info night to answer any questions 
you might have. 

This year, Panhellenic is 
taking an entirely different 
approach to Spring Rush. Unlike 
the past years. the pan hellenic rush 
will now follow the fraternity rush 
fon~at; All nine sororities on 
campus will be having informal 
rush on the same dares. Dress code 
will be very casual as the rush 
atmosphere will be infonnal. 
Rushees are free to visit with any 
chapter at any time. Also, unlike 
formal rush, rushees are not 
required to pay fees . 

Information night will be 
held on Wednesday. April 10th 
from 8PM to IOPM in the Price 
Center Ballroom. On this night. 
Rushees will receive a calendar 
that lists the sororities, the times of 
their events for each night and the 
places where the functions will be 
held. Bach chapter will set up a 
booth that night so that rushees 
may be able to get a feel for each 
chapter and whoseevents they may 
want to attend on the following 
nights. 

From Thursday, April 
I I th through Saturday, April 
13th, rushees should visit as 
many chapters as they can 
and try to get to kn~w the 
women in each chapter. It is 
important for the rushee to 
visit each house and find 
out which one is right for 
herself instead of only 

visiting the houses which her 
friends belong to or the chapters 
that she "knows of." The purpose 
of rush experience is to meet a 
variety of people that you would 
not nonnally encounter. On these 
nights. many chapters will have 
themes for their events, and food 
and drinks will be served. 

If a rushee needs to talk to 
someone or has any questions 
during rush, Rho Chi's will be 
available. Rho Chi's are rush

counselors who have disaffiliated 
from their respective chapters in 
order to guide and advise rushees 
throughout the week. They will be 
glad to answer questions and give 
advice but will not and cannot assist 
someone in choosing a chapter. If 
a rushee visits and interacts with 
the women in each chapter, it will 
not be difficult for her to recognize 
the chapter thaI appeals the most to 
her. It is important for her to 
remember that choosing a sorority 

. is also choosing a group of friends 
who will playa crucial role in her 
sociallife. They are people th,tshe 
hangs out with. studies with and 
associates with during her college 
years and for the rest of her life. 

Sunday. April 14th is Bid 
Day . This is the day when the 
rushees will receive bids from the 
sororities. Unlike formal rush, 
where a rushee receives only one 
bid from her first or second choice. 
informal rush allows her to receive 
more that one bid. I f she has visited 
all nine chapters, it may be possible 
for her to receive nine bids. The 
greater number of houses she visits 
during the week, the greaterchance 
she will have to receive more bids. 
She must decide which chapter to 
join and may accept only one bid. 
Then she'll be on her way to meet 
the rest of the pledge class and be 
welcomed by her sisters that she 
has chosen to be with.

WHALES: 
Searching for grays 
ContInued from ..... 7 
similar to what the whalers must 
have felt well over a half century 
ago. 1lle ocean is the whale's turf, 
and though they are spoken of as the 
"gentle gianls" of the sea, images of 
Moby Dick demolishing fishing 
boats remain fresh in my mind. 

Then again, the excitement 
could stem from the unique risk 
involved in whale watching, one 
that few other recreational acti vities 
offer: There is always the chance 
that Ihe featured altrae ti on may 
never show up. And to me, Ihis 
seems like a very di stinct possibili-
ty. 

Seaforth Sportfishing tries to 
guarantee their customers an up-
close and personal encounter. 

"Sometimes we do come oul here 
anti we don't see them," Ray says. 
"Mosl often we see them during the 
northern migrnlion because they 
gather in big pods, while in the south-
ern migration whales \mvel in small-
er groups and are more spread out." 

Our goal - the grny whale - is 
chamcterized by its tubular body 
shape and mottled gray color, tinged 
by numerous clusters of barnacles. 
Of course, we also welcome 
encounters with other creatures 
from the deep. Ray notes thai the 
San I?iego frequently stumbles onto 
other animals. especially white-

sided porpoises. dolphins. occas-
sional sea lions and killer whales. 

TIle undeniable sense of adven-
ture heightens as we get further 
from shore. Jt is almost as if we are 
on a quest. like our whaling forefa-
thers were, though our goal is noth-
ing more than to catch a glimpse of 
these mammals. To take my mind 
off Ihe increasingly turbulent 
waters, I begin to acquaint myself 
with my fellow passengers. You'd 
be hard-pressed to find a scurvier 101 
of salty sea dogs. 

'This is the fi rst time we've ever 
really been out in the ocean," says 
Bob, a resident of a rural town 
located 130 miles south of Chicago, 
called Bloomington, Illinois. Clad 
in jeans and a zip-up windbreaker, 
he and his wife Joan arc visiting 

. Southern California for the first 
time. Apparently, there are not too 
many opportunities to view whales 
up in Ihe Great Lakes. 

To Iheir credit , though, neilher 
seems to mind the endless swaying 
and teetering of lhe boat. I , on the 
other hand, a nalive Califomian 
who has lived near the Pacific for 
my entire life, have to sit down sev-
ern! times, close my eyes and envi-
sion myselr on stable ground 10 
steady my stomach. 

Continuing my interaction with 
the other passengers, I have my fears 
about not seeing any whales eased 
somewhat by Elizabeth, a medical 
student at UCSD. She was on a suc-
cessful Seaforth whale-watching 

elBA NewVues $144* --".-"-~--.

Flipper: Dolphins are often sited around gray whales , and are curious of boat activity. 

cruise a mere IwO weeks earlier. 
"We saw some last time," 

Elizabeth says. " One of them even 
breached." 

A "breach" IS when a whale pro-
pels itself spectacularly from the 
water. The dream of every camera-
toting watcher is to catch the act on 
film - a feat Elizabeth admits she 
was unable to accomplish. Her 
brother George, a senior at lndiana 
Uni versity, appears ready to suc-
ceed where his sister had failed. We 
are hardly out of port and his cam-
era is already poised, ready to click 
a snap hot al a moment's notice. 

I have my doubts despite

petual queasiness, we have covered 
12 miles and have seen hardly a 
seagull, much less a gray whale. 

That all changes when the cap-
tain's intercom cackles to life to 
report a spout about half of a mile 
off the bow. At thaI moment, fccl-
ings of seasickness quickly subside 
as all 89 passengers recklessly 
charge to the bow of the boat, strain-
ing to catch a glimpse. 

As the San Diego speeds closer 
to the dark forms on the horizon, it 
becomes clear why the gray-whale 
population was hunted 10 the brink 
of extinction: They travel fairly 
slowly, around six kilometers an 
hour and do not seem particularly 
frightened or even cognizant of boat 
activity. Captain Bob knows better, 
however. 

"They can tell we're there," says 
Captain Bob, a weathered skipper 
who has seen his share of whales in 
over 30 years of leading Seaforth 
whale-watching cruises. "They 
have really good ears - they hear 
us - they know where we' re at all 
of the time." 

Our craft is able to get fairly 
close to them - within 50 yards -
and from that distance it becomes 
clear that we have stumbled upon a 
pod of four to six grays, a small calf 
among them. 'The term "small" is 
relative here, of course: TIle new-
borns have been known to tip the 
scales at a healthy 1.5 tons. 

The pod is returning notth to the 
Bering Sea where they feed from 
May through November. , As it

"The JI'Iys do mosI oldleir nav-

"They follow ridJCS II the boIIom." 

The crowd is IrcIIed 10 added 
excitemenl when a dolphin appears 
at the same lime as the whales, play-
fully swimming around the boaI and 
hilchin, a ride on the San D~go's 
bow wave. Our sighting of the pod 
seems 10 suppon the notion that the 
gray whale population is al pre-whal·

Mel most of the world for thai mat-
ter - there is still some conam 
aboul the ,ray-whale population. 
Many experts fear that the countless 
whale-Witching boats and increas-
ing boat traffic is aIlerin, their 
mi,ralion patterns. Those in the 
whale-watching industry do I\()( buy 
into this theory, though. 

'They say that the boll traffic

some general disappointment aboul 
havillllO leave so soon, but the feel-
ing is soon overcome as pusenaers 
giddily discuss what they have seen. 
Nobody feels seasick anymore. 

"I've never seen them up that

deN of La Jolla. "II wu peal."

Captain Bob notes that such

At the Erne.t Orlando LaUJrence Be.'ey National 
Laboratory (Berkeky Lab). we recognize that the success of our 
programs comes from the combined achievements of the people 
who work here. Working together, the many programs at the 
Berkeky Lab have been a product of this phenomenon of 
synergy. 

With this in mind, the Berkeley Lab has added a 
supercomputing center to the mix, the newly rewcated National 
Energy Research Scientifu; Computing Center (NERSC). 
Focusing on a varUlty of challenges ranging from gwbal change 
to partick accelerator design. NERSC aUows Berkeley 
Lab scientists to create innovative approaches to scientifu; 
problems, focusing always on the user community.

needs to serve as a representative of all students, In 
order to do that il is essential thal you have a broad 
base of experience with students, like reaching oul 
to a lot of different student group and individual 
students, and also have at least some A.S. experi-
ence. I have all that. I was an A.S. senator. I was 
chair of a college council. I ' ve been on many dif-
ferent commiuees, such as the Chaneellor 's Search 
Commiuee, the Women 's Center Planning and 
Advisory Committee and the OASIS Advisory 
Board. I've worked with a 101 of different student 
organizations, and I feel that combining all that past 
experience as well as that continued outreach, I can 
be a strong and lrue representative to the students.

outbreak of "bloc voting" and !he dying

VICE PRESIDENT 
External Mfairs 

In the last five years, student fees in the 
UC 5yRem have 80M up 135 percen!, finan-
cial aid has been cut and little student input 
has been solicited on studeot issues by the 
regents or the administration. For 
these reasons, UCSD students 
need a representative to serve 
them at the system- and 
statewide level. 

Now Ihat Smith vs.

meeting the needs of students, and his

The Guardian strongly endorses Alex T. 
Tom for vice president of external affairs. 

VICE PRESIDENT 
Finance 

Vice president finance candidate hal 
Orviss, on the Studen" PIrst! sIIte, appears 
to have a solid agenda for next yea- if elect-
ed. His plans include "greater outreach" 10 
student organizations and students; speed-
ing up the funding process; and 
increasing the responsibilities of 
the Finance Committee. Orviss 
also said he has voicemail for 
accessibility purposes, and he 
said he would hold office hours in 
visible places outside the offICe. 

Orviss has financial experi-
ence on the A.S: He was appointed 
financial controller and has served on 
the A.S. Finance Committee. As a 

finance office's inner workings and a 
long list of accomplishments. 

Robinson, on the U.N.I.T.E. slate, 
increased the budget for student orgs; 

smoothed Ihe kinks out of the funding 
process; increased the responsibil-

ities of his office; visited stu-
dent orgs for input; and 
extended the bus lines. He 

maintained his "accessibili-
ty" by holding office hours a 

minimum of 12 hours per 
week and using a pager. 

Robinson 's ideas are far more 
concrete, detailed, larger in number 
and more original than Orviss' ideas.

Commissioners 
ACADEMIC AFFAIRS 

Current Commissioner of Academic Affairs CbriIty Guidi. on the Students 
First! slate, was appointed during Winter Quarter. Despite !he bn:vity of her A.S. 
experience. she gained a solid understanding of die wortUngs of her ollke. Her 
rJlSt-hand observlllions of the academic affairs position - and the A.S. in gen-
eral- have shown her how much-needed improvements can be made. 

She has worud with the Comminee on Educational Policy, made contacts 
wilh key UCSD administrators and worked on campus outreach and retention 
programs. More importantly, she bas specifIC plans for accomplishing her goals. 

Among Guidi's plans for next year are: fonning a comminoe to fight e-mail 
fees; negotiating with Transportation and Parking Services for the restoration of 
disabled-student carts; working on an A.S. end<nement of the proposed UCSD 
OIarter High School to put pressure on the chancellor 10 approve it; improving 
communication with students tIvough a questionnaires on the back of CAPE 
manuals; rolling back the drop deadline for "W's"; and increasing the number of 
units for lab courses. 'The list goes on, ever specific, ever logical. The same can-
not be said of Guidi 's opponents, who lack her prncticality and vision. 

Carol Tran, running on the U.N.l.TE. slate. has worked on various mentor 
programs, as well as some academic-award programs. Like Guidi, she i con-
cerned with rolling back Ihe "W" deadline, insuuctor improvement and increas-
ing lab uni ts. She also plans to improve and increase student-scholarship awards. 
However, Tran's experience is not as job-specific as Guidi 's. Furlhennore, Tran 
has few plans for hcr office - no expanded responsibilities, no new ideas. 

Marcus Wong, who is running independently of any late, has two main 
concerns for Ihe Academic Affairs office: increasing Internel access and giving 
more publicity to academic program on campus. But the si milarities to both 
Tran and Guidi stop here. He does not think that increasing lab units is impor-
tant. He believes that pushing back the "W" deadline is currently impossible, but 
he says he will negotiate with the auministration regardle s. He says that increas-
ing Ihe 10 minutes between classes to 15 minutes "is not much of an i sue." 

Guidi, in contrast to both her opponents. has the gusto and common sense to 
make her office what it should be and not what her opponents would settle for. 
For these reason, Ihe Goon/iall editorial board strongly endorses Chri ti Guidi 
for commiSSIOner of academic affairs. 

COMMUNICATIONS 
Current Commis ioner of Communications Farsam Shadab has sufficient 

experience on the A.S., perronally working in campus alternative media and 
occasionally contributing articles 10 the GIUlrdian. 

However, Shadab's accomplishments for the past year are few and far 
between. As commissioner. he streamlined the flow of A.S. money into alter-
native media by liquidating publicalions which were producing lillie or not at 

all. He also hired a maintenance worker for the alternative-media room, 
which was and still is in dire need of allention. in the Old Student Center. 

Shadab's plans for nexi year are praclical but unimpressive. Like hi s 
opponent, Students First! slate member James Fabionar, Shadab real-
izes that a major problem of alternative media is visibility. And also like 
Fabionar. Shadab wanlS to purchase racks for alternative print media. 
Beyond thal, Shadab's future goals for hi posiLJon are vague. 

Fabionar has lillie experience outside of hi s communications major, 
but has many goals to make up for it. Hi s plans, like others on his slate, 
mclude "accountability" and "accessibility." More concretely, he wants 10 
start all all-student-organizallons publication and an A.S. newspaper. 
However, both are problematic because Fabionar has lillie understanding 
of the funding process - however, he said advertising i a possibility. 

In addition, Fabionar said he would mediate between publicalions and 
the A.S., but this is part of his job. He also wants to push for more visibil-
ity for the UCSD Student-Run Television (SRTV) by perhaps pUlling tele-
vision sets in highly populated areas on the campus, such as the Price 
Center. But again, his plans for funding his ideas are vague at best. 

In weighing the worlh of each candidate for the commissioner of com-
munications position, neither one is impressive enough to merit a Goon/iarl 
endorsernent. Shadab has experience but few plans for improvement. 
Fabionar has no experience and many plans, but less knowledge and few 

ideas about the funding process. Because neither candidate is beller Ihan Ihe 
other, we abstain from an endorsement for this position. 

OPERATIONS & SERVICES 
Thc commissioner of operations. services and enterprises oversees A.S.-run 

businesses on campus, such as A.S. Lecture Notes, Soft Reserves and the 
Grove Cafe. Students need a commissioner of operations who is familiar with 
the needs of the Ch~ Cafe and the student-run co-ops as well . 

Enter Erin HoIve, a member of the Students First! slate, whose experi-
ence includes acting as a liaison between the A.S. and the UCSD Food Co-
operatives. Holve's dedication 10 improving student-run businesses is the 
key point of her campaign. 

Shc promises to bring back to Ihe Old Student Center the opportunities 
and busi nesses which dwindled after the construction of Ihe Price Center. 
By informing students of Jobs at the Student Center, improving mainte-
nance and inereasing publicity, Holve hopes to attract more students to the 
center and increase the profits of current student-run businesses. 

If elected, Holve would strive for an increased operating budget for Ihe 
Old Studenl Center and would use these funds to create a downstairs 
lounge area and 10 install indoor seating at the Grove. Holve also promis-
es to improve the markdability of Soft Reserves by decreasing turnaround 
time. To increase the Grove's profits, Holve plans LO detennine how its ser-
vices and menu can be improved. 

Holve's opponent is M .... ¥ Reddy, whose platform is little more than 
an echo of the U.N.I.T.E. slate's agenda of securing corporate donations. He 

expressed little knowledge of the problems which exist wilhin this jurisdiction. 
Reddy 's only specific goal was 10 work with the business community to otfer 

special discounts to students. Such a plan already exists, however, in the form of 
a discount card. Though soliciting corporate sponsorship is an excellent idea. it 
seems unlikely that Reddy would know how to allocate donations correctly. 

While Reddy has admirable goals, his knowledge of what Ihis office entails 
is slim. Holve has realized the problems which ellist in A.S.-run businesses, and 
she has developed specific plans to solve them. For these reasons, the Guardian 
endorses Erin Holve for commissioner of operations, services and enterprises.

bil of detail. The University of California 
as a part of the government of the state of 
California is a non-profil organization. 
However, the way the IRS works is - a 
101 of companies when lhey are looking 
to donate money to somebody are 
uncomfortable donating 10 a particular 
organization without the IRS saying you 
ha ve tax -exempt stalus. So even though 
we lechnically have that tax-exempl sta-
tus because we are a part of the state of 
California, the Stale of California itself is 
nol on that list. If we can make that a 
more fonnaJized thing, which Francis 
thinks willllOl be a problem, dlen it will 
be a 101 easier for 11$10 solicil outside cor-
porauons for donations. 

Basically, I wtiJil 10 reorient the A.S. 
li!>Cally ncxt year, make the A.S. more. 
Income-oriented raIher than neafly relianl 
on the studenl-activity fee. I think A.S. 
Mlould become more or a self- ufftctenl 
orgamzauon. So doina dungs like giving 
up Slate and federal Ial\ -exempt SIIIUS 
and gelting those donal ion • u ing thaI 
nnoney 10 Start an A.S. scholarship pr0-
gram, whIch hasn'l been done before, 
and u ing that money 10 pot mto Soft 

where dill money's going and whether 
'il's actually 5el'Ving die students. What 
we wiJl do this year is revamp die fund-
ing process 10 make sure thai the money 
being allocated is used wisely. 

Another goal of mine, if elected pres-
ident, is 10 have the A.S. buy ~uipment 
We spend a tremendous amount of 
money funding studenl organizations to 
rent audio-video ~uipment, PA systems, 
stages, etc. Why doesn'l AS. buy or 
invest in Ihis ~uipmenl so they don't 
have to dish Oul money for something 
over and over again? Taking these kinds 
of steps to reduce A.S. spending will 
aclually increase the amounl of funding 
10 sludent organizations. 

If this doesn't produce the necessary 
amount of funding for student organiza-
tIOns, then, yes, I'm in favor of a fee 
increase. But first the A.S. Council needs 
10 take Ihe inillative 10 find oul where the 
money is being losl and come up with 
new ways 10 save money. 
Ale JOU committed to IIIprroot.c:blcr;tl!lIntIC 
the $1.50 per Itudent that goes to 
UCSA? 

I think UCSA IS critical for UCSD 
students. We do not h~e any type of 
organized, ystemwide voice to Ihe 
regents or the legislalure unless we have 
UCSA Without U SA, you would see 
an increase in your fees. You would see a 
decrease in financial aid. We need that 
type of organization to make sure thaI 
ludents' nghts are fought for at the ys-

lemwlde level. 
How do you plan to deal with the 
Implneln,need for a fuI audit of 
tile Chi Cafe? 

The A.S. Council this year said they 
were really commilled to the Ch6, but 

Reserves and the Grove and maybe even 
staning a new A.S. venture next year. 

There is so much opportunity - we 
have about $4O(),OOO in our mandated-
reserve account whIch IS just silting 
there. It eams minimal interest. If we can 
reinvest thaI money in a way that we can 
gel more off the return, then there are a 
lot of opportunities for A.S. LO be making 
more money off of whal we've already 
got. 
Tell III about tile new c:ondtutIon. 

The new con lItution is modeled on 
the federal government and also takes the 
posilive aspects out of our democratic 
model, so thaI you have different branch-
es of government. llle executives check 
the senalors and the senalors check the 
executives. 

There is a 101 of concern that gelling 
rid of all the commissioners - having 
them appointed - would destroy the 
checks and balances. 

We have to remember, commission-
ers had been appointed up until three or 
four years ago. I think we've tried elect-
ing commissioner , and it's been okay, 
bUI there have been commissioners that 
have IlOI done the greatesl jobs. The sen-
ale will become a much more empow-
ered and influential body than it is now, 
and that's where the balance will come 
out. 
Ale you In fIMIr of tile Student ute 
RaWelidum? 

Personally. I think I'm going to vote 
for it. I'm glad it 's on the ballot. II could 
positively influence UCSD. as it is 
becomink one of the mo I prominenl uni-
versilies in the nation. I think our spans 
are inevitably going 10 have 10 improve 
and come up from Division III if we are 
going to compele with the top universi-
ties in the nalion. 

But at the same time, one of the rea-
sons I chose UCSD is thaI they didn 't 
have 3 foolball leam - Ihat was an 
altractivc qualily 10 me al the time. My 
views have changed since Ihen but 
maybe students feel thaI this is a charac-
teristic thaI they wanl to mainlain - a 
non-active, non-athletIC campus. 
Why II an ........ $4.50 for A.S. 
InaIudId an tile ,.,.idum? 

The easiest way for them 10 do il was 
to tack their fee onlO an existing fee. So 
that meanl tacking il ontO either the A.S. 
fee, the RlMAC fee or the Canyon view 
fee. RlMAC and Canyonview said "no." 
In fact, when A.S. was Ialking about iI, 
they were considering making the A.S. 
fee really minimal, like 25 cenls, JUst to 
say that A.S. IS a part of It. 
CotiIIderIfW tIuIt ,au oppoM .,. 

The UCSD Guardian 

whit kind of support did you see coming 
from diem this ye. except for die waive 
of the audit? Why don't they say, "We 
wiJI help you raise some money, we wiJI 
hetp you advertise for an event, we will 
help you gellhal audil'1" I wi II take those 
necessary steps 10 ensure thaI they can 
comply with the MoU, so thai they can 
stay on this campus. 
Would ,au ..... taIti •• mcM to tile 
Old StudInt Center for tile A.S.? 
How would ,au do It? 

We think the Price Center is very 
inaccessible 10 sludents. II's very much a 
deterrenl to students who have an issue 
10 go all the way up there. That's why 
we're looking to move the AS. The besl 
site might be Building B lal the Old 
Studenl Cenler]. It 's a much more acces-
sible area 10 all sludents. And it 's much 
more importanl to be accessible LO the 
studenls than to have a nice office. 
Ale you In r.vor of tile UCSD 
CIwter School prapoutI? Would you 
put the weIItrt of yow ofIIcI behind 
It? 

I'm very much in support of the char-
Ler school. I happen to be one of the rep-
resentatives on the UCSD Chaner High 
School Student Committee. I've worked 
closely with Provost Lytle and with olher 
people who are Involved with the <!haner 
high sehool. Today, there's a serious 
problem with bringing disavantaged stu-
denls into higher education. Would I put 
the weighl of my office behind the 
school? Yes. I feel thaI the majority of the 
sludents are behind this. I believe the 
A.S. Council of any year would have 
endorsed the charter high school because 
it is very good for UCSD in terms of con-
neclion with the community, and it is 

tem-wIcIe feel, how can _ JUItIfy taxi. 0UFI4IheI to IUCh an extent? 
That's why I'm really hesitant about 

the fee referendum. That 's why I'm not 
rea lly publicly campaignmg for or 
again'" it. Personally, I think I'm going to 
vote for it just because I think il would be 
a good thing for UCSD sehool spinl. Bul 
at the arne time I think il could send a 
negative message 10 the regents, and it 
could nave SOt'J1e rJe!'a,jvc impect.1 III 
UCSD. So it 's nOl really one of my main 
campaign i sues this year. 
WhIt do you JAn to do with UC 
Student Auoc:IatIon fundIrC? 

I think I'd lobby 10 keep it as it is. I 
think lasl year when we had that big fias-
co, somebody presented a proposal thaI 
would make the UCSD fee a lillie bil 
more equal among the various camposes. 
Per sludenl, UCSD pays more than other 
campuses. 8uI thaI is somdhing thaI 
would have to be adopted on a system 
wide level. I'd favor that siluation. II 
would give UCSA the stabilily they need 
to keep functioning, but althe same time 
it makes il a lillie bil more fair for the rest 
of the campuses. 
Ate you In fIMIr of Ithi.lo .. mlliortty 
......,.? 

Absolulely. I'm amazed thaI this 
became an issue at all because it never 
has been in the past. The way I sec it, il 
provides a chance for certain groups of 
sludents who maybe feel thaI they don 'I 
always gel recognition thaI they would 
like eome together and have a celebra-
tion at the end of the year. It ·s a way to 
recognize themselves, and I think thaI's 
great. 
If I WII1ted to do a white "...,. 
tIon, and It ... open to .. people, 
would you fund It? 

Probably. But reali tically, I don't 
foresee anything like thaI happening. I 
think it would probably cause a problem 
on campus. 
Why II tIuIt? Bec:auM It would be 
cIvIIM? 

II would probably be divisive, il 
mighl anger some people. 
So you cIon't 1IIInk It workI botti 
ways? 

If a group wants 10 get together and 
say, "We' re going to recognize our 
friends for their accomplishments," then 
I don't see any reason why that's bad. 
How .. ,au IDIIW to ... with the 
Chi Cell' • ...., to tInMcI a fill 
audit? 

The CM has indicated that lhey will 
be able to lum in a full audit next 
Oclober, so I hope and believe that they 
wi II follow through on that 

incredibly good for those SIIIdenIs who 
will line aa:eu to a higher educaIion by 
going IIvough the charter high schoo/. 
Do ,ou eupport atudent money 
... to I'MIIIIIIy ......... cer. 
monIII? 

I think dial the incorporation of cul-
ture is never a bad thing. and the fact that 
they are open 10 all students means that 
there's no reason why they should nol be 
funded. 
WauId ,au fund • white ~ 
... thouCh It'. open to everyone? 

You have 10 remember the hislory of 
this country. You have to acknowledge 
the fact that having a white celebration 
would send a negative message 10 other 
people. The reason why these groups 
have ethnic graduations is because they 
wanl to incorporate some pan of their 
culture iDlO the ceremony. In terms of a 
whiLe graduation, the gradualions thaI we 
have now are pretty much mainstream 
ceremonies. I would queslion what 
would make their ceremony any differenl 
than what the school provides. 
Talk about the tailed town hall meet-
frtC at Muir, whIcti drew only three 
people, 

The lown hall meeting was an exam-
pie of the inability oftheA.S. 10 advenise 
for an evenl. You need 10 use every 
resource you can to let sludents know 
what's happening. You can't pot up one 
flyer in one area and expect students to 
show up. 

Personally, I plan on auending at least 
two student organizalion meelings a 
week to find oul what those student 
issues are, the concerns thaI they have, so 
thaI I can tell them what's happening on 
the campos or systemwide. I am commil-

And • tlley can't1 
I always thought that il needs to be 

renegotiated in some way that still main-
tains liability for the AS. and helps the 
CM out. It 's really up 10 the co-ops more 
than anybody. AS. doesn'l really have 
any say about it. But if the CM could 
incorporate with the Food Co-op or just 
with their money, I think that would be 
the besl thing. 

11tcre ... been......., crfddom dwl 
the constitutiOIl was crammed through 
quickly, and there WIiS going to be a 
special election in the sprinc without 
_gil support (rom the student body 
or rrom the A.S_ as a whole_ 

I really don't think this has been a 
quick process al all. Every year lhal I 
have been al UCSD, somebody has tried 
to rewrite the A.S. Conslitulion or hold a 
constilutional convention. This particular 
process was staned in Oclober of this /asl 
year, and il was neve:r a secret. I and the 
other people who helped me write it, we 
were always talking 10 people:, going 10 
student groups and I talked to various 
sludents around campus and to other A.S. 
members, all the way to the senate. And I 
really feel like there's been a 101 of stu-
dent inpul on this . 
Why did a. town ..... rneetInI fall? 
WII you try It .... n? How wit JOU 
Improve ace ... 1bIIIty to a. A.S, 
c:ouncI? 

I think there are several reasons it 
failed. Frankly, I don 't think thaI pUlling 
A.S. out in the middle of a quad..some-
where and saying "Please come talk to 
us" is a very effeclive way of improving 
acce sibilily. I called them "reverse 
council meetings." A.S. council would 
attend individual college council meel-
ings. They would talk 10 Muir College 
council, for example, and get Mec to get 
people in the residential halls to come to 
the meetings. So then it's more like A.S. 
is coming 10 people who are already 
there, rather than us juS! silting OUI there 
and saying "Please come to us."

ted 10 havingmy office hocn where IarF 
groups of students congregate. 
Additionally, the A.S. Council needs 10 
move on 10 the information supafiigh-
way. Why isn 'l there a published list of 
all the A.S. senators and commissioners 
and executive members e-mail address-
es? I think al50 that a web paae would be 
an exceJlenl idea for students 10 get infor-
mation on the issues 
What about A.s, autonollly? 

That's IlOI somdhing thaI I'm heavi-
ly enumer.ating in my campaign because 
what I'm trying to run on are truly tangi-
ble goals. The aulonomy issue is huge 
and it's not something Ihal one president 
can accomplish in one term. I will defi-
nilely continue the efforts for autonomy. 
I will not make the promise that I will get 
autonomy because I do IlOI wanl 10 fail 
the students. 
How are you going to reaIIocale funds 
without raising rees? 

It's going 10 take a lot of work. But 
you have to find out where the adminis-
tration is spending the money. We don't 
have a good idea where sludent funds are 
going. What is the income of the univer-
sity? Where does thaI money go in terms 
of paying for all the essential parts of the 
campos? Where are the services funded 
from? When the regents merged the gen-
eral fee with the educational fee, they 
messed up a 101 of the funding for ser-
vices on this campus. 

Although there is student representa-
tion on the sludenl registration fee com-
mittee, I know that the A.S. Council rep-
resentative has nol been accountable to 
the A.S. Council Ihe past couple years. 
The flflil step you can take is holding that 
representative accountable. 

I don 'I thinks so. Pan of thaI problem 
is thaI the A.S. have never used our 
income to fund organizations. We've 
only used the activity fees LO fund orga-
nizations. So as we try 10 reorient A.S. to 
rely more 011 its own income: rather than 
the activity fee, we're going to have 10 
change some of those rules. And a 101 of 
Ihal will be helped by the new 
Constilution. Dullrrou ___ ... _ .... 

tmllcMs, doeIn't tIuIt prevent JOU 
from I8VIrW up for autonomy? 

You 'd have 10 budget the money. We 
would obviously keep a savings account. 
But I would like 10 invest thaI money in 
an accounl thai earns a lot more interesl 
than il does now, because it earns mini-
mal interest right now. 
What'. your poeItIon an tile pr0-
posed ctwt. 1CIiooI? 

I'm in 'favor of it. If we can gel San 
Diego Unified School Districllo support 
it, then I think that would be a big step 
forward. I know thaI the committee we 
were on, when we were talki ng to the 
regents aboul the charier school, they 
were just drooling over it So it's defi-
nilely a posilive thing. Since the regents 
CUI alftnnalive action, this is exaclly the 
type of thing that would help make up for 
that. 
Ale you ..... to ...... for It? 

Definilely. I think [Inlerim 
Chancellor) Caserio has been a little bit 
of a barrier 10 helping il move forward. 
As soon as the new chancellor comes in, 
I think thaI's the time to go and push for 
the charter school. 
Studmt fwIIb were oftm used thi<i 
year ror events wbidi weft not neces-
sarily supported by tile entire student

decide that thi<i is really a raUy that 
students waot to stlmd bebInd, to II5e 
their ~ ror? How do you deter .. 
mine wbidi side to tab? 

I would be really in favor of A.S. next 
year doing more evenlS that are bi-parti-
san. We need surveys and outreach 10 
find oul how students feel aboul affirma-
tive action or fee inaeases. BUI al the 
same time, I think il would be belter 10 
have debates and gel professors on both 
ides of the issues 10 get up and bailie 

each other on iSSl!eS like that I think it's 
a betlet way 10 moIivlle SlUdenlS aboul 
issues. And then at the same lime, A.S. 
can really Jearn what die students think, 
what is the majority opinion out there. 
Using web page, e-mail, College Club, 
we can do surveys and use more 
resources 10 try to find out whal sludents 
think.

HEARN: 
meal plan when I served on the Housing 
and Dining Services Committee. Also, 
when I was on the University Center 
Advisory Board (UCAB), the chainnan 
was IlOI representing students at all. I and 
others lobbied Ihe individual voting 
members of the UCAB because they had 
some qualms with him as well. The 
administralion foughl us every slep of the 
way. We voted to impeach him. Staff, 
faculty and alumni all voted for him to 
stay. And since it took a three-fourths 
majority, he stayed. So we called a new 
election and we got rid of hIm. 
What Is your agenda? 

We really need to go to the capitol 
and start lobbying. For each or the issues 

STREIT: 
Actually, I've had class every 

Wednesday night this quaner. 
Could you give some details as to 
your agenda for the comIng ygr? 

I think the most importanl thing we 
need is increased communi aLion. TIle 
average studenl doesn't have any com-
municallOn wuh the A.S. Council for two 
reason : One, they don 't neces anly have 
Ihe mean, 10 communicate easily wllh 
Ihe A.S. Council, and IWO, I think they're 
inllmldllted . 
How would you open up communI-
cation? 

Thmgs I've talked about are dIrect c-
muilto the A.S. preSident If I can't get a 
directltnc, I'll gIve eve£)'onc m~ person-
al addre~,. If I have to. I'll an,wer every 
~ lIlg l c e-mail pcr,onally. 

Another idea is 10 geL more involved 
with the incommg freshmen, because 

I wanl 10 tackle, I intend 10 appoinl an 
executive advocate, because one: presi-
dent can'l pul enough time into every sin-
gle issue in order 10 do il well. I would 
have one individual working specifically 
on fees and system-wide issues. Working 
with external, he would contacl legisla-
tors all across the state. I would be visil-
ing with them when I have the opponu-
nity. •

I support the idea but it's nOI feasible 
at this time. Before we talk about privati-
zation and before we talk about tax-

they're actually going to be here the 
longest. I'd love to help freshmen move 
in with theIr stuff in the fall. I'd say, 
"Look, here 's my phone number, here's 
my e-mail address. If you have any prob-
lems gelling adjusted to UCSD, give me 
a call and I'll help you out." A.S. ha.> 
never tried to communicate in this fash-
ion before. 
Where's the waste In the A.S_ 
Council? 

The A . . Council looks al mdlvtdual 
program, thaI they 're spending m ney 
on. bUI they don 't ask whether they can 
spend that money beller somewhere ebe. 
For example, the first TG was a huge 
production, almost on the scale of what 
we have tor the Sun God Festl~al. I thm~ 
,tudcnL\ would rather have a blweckly, 
small-scale TG than maybe two huge 
TG~ a year.

exempt status, we need 10 make A.S.

ment 
How do ,ou hope to achieve auto.. 
my? 

Well, through negotiations ftrst. We'd 
get an attomey on retainer. If negotia-
tions failed, then we can take legal 
action. EssentiaJly, other sehools have 
done it. There's precedent OUI there. 
0eecfIbe this yur'. A.S, CouncIl. 

I went 10 maybe IWO or three A.S. 
meetings this past year. Bul I perceived 
a lack of cooperation, a lack of mulual 
goals. 
Ale you In favor of the new proposed 
A.S_ ConstItutIon? 

Yes, I'm in favor of it, in generql. It 's 
more flexible lhan the one that we"/e got 

lUes? 
I think that we should def'ir.itely 

make the student organizations II1Ne 
reltam on Ihemselves. We give money to 
countle s groups, over $100,000. If 
they ' re going 10 have an organizaLion, 
and they have enough members, it WIll 
be sclf-sustaining. If you just give people 
Ihat kind of money, they might nol spend 
it well beC<luse it 's not commg Ollt 01 
Iheir own pocket. 
Considering you're not on a slate, 
and assuming you're elected presI-
dent, how will you Interact with the 
rest of the council? 

First, I think there 's a lot of polential 
for an A.S. president to work unilatera lly 
In way. that doesn 't undennme the coun-
CIl. I thln~ the A.S. presIdent could u~c 
hiS per..onlll innuen e 111 gelling dona-
lions from local phIlanthropIsts. local 
businesses and UCSD alumni. You Clln 
aCLually use the name of the president to 

now. The cunenl document is contradic-
tory and outdated and can'l be changed 
easily. The new one can be changed by 
the council with a very large vOle. 
can you talk about tile fee referen-
dum? Ale you In fIivor of It? 

I personally did nOI participate in the 
creation of this. I intend 10 vote for it. All 
the money would come back 10 the stu-
dents, and the students thaI would be 
affected by this are students who spend a 
101 of time involved in athletics, so they 
are forced to pay team expenses: bus 
Iran portation, uniforms. Right now, 
UCSD port program are funded at the 
same level as the lowest 10 percent of 
Division ffI schools. 
00 JOU think the regentl will take 
III aerIouIIy If _ levy a $30 fee 

get thing done that don 't necessarily 
need the approval of the council. 
But What about all the connections 
the current A.S_ members ~.ave with 
the administration? 

The current line of communication 
with the administration are so sohdified, 
thaI they can't sec what's wrong wilh 
tho e lines of communication. We've had 
the same type of people on the A.S. 
Council for a long time, and you can see 
how the quality ofhfe on thIS campus has 
dechned. TheIr "experience" IS just a 
syn nym for Ihe factthatthey'vc done II 
before and that they're the insiders, that 
they're going 10 produce the same resulL ..

upon CIIINeMe? 
Other schools have done this: UC 

Davis raised their fees a 101 higher than 
we've done it, and I've never heard the 
regents commenl on it. 

Also, I dori't think the regents would 
even know. We have one of the lowest 
activity fees of any school in this system. 
I think it may reflect upon the somewhat 
stagnanl nalure of campus life here aL 
UCSD. It's nOl like we are raising our 
fees left and righl. This is something that 
has not happened in over 10 years. 
Student organi7.8tions can't pul on the

GUARDIAN CLASSIFIEDS 



18 OPINION 

Taking Measure·s HEARN: the country beclUSC Ihe A.S. doesn't have enough travel expenses. Thal negatively impacts the ability of students to represent OW' school. 
Do you ... .., ........ of cutIIIC UClA 
fUndIrC? A fee referendum and two ASUCSD constitu-

tional amendments await undergraduate approval 
this year. While the two amendments might embrace 
debatable concepts which may improve student life 
on campus. the fee referendum contains little, if any, 
qualities which justify its passing. However, Ihe fee 
referendum is dangerously likely to pass, consider-
ing the traditionally low turnout of voters and the 
strong bloc of athletes and lheir supporterS who will 
be voting in favor of the hike. 

"STUDENT LIFE" 
Put on the ballot due to the efforts of UCSD ath-

letes, thl referendum asks the student body to 
approve an additional $29.50 per student. per quar-
ter to be tacked on to the current $ 13.50 student 
activity fee, making the tOtal activity fee S43 per 
quarter, or $129 per year. This additional money 
would provide $2 to i~tramurals , $3 to sports clubs 
and $20 to inlercoliegialC sports. Furthermore. the 
A.S. would receive an additional $4.50 per quarter. 

Sports programs may be underfunded - but the 
student body should not be compelled to pay for a 
small percentage of students to participate. particu-
larly because the athletic department already has its 
own budget. funded from your registration fees. 

Proponents of the referendum argue that intra-
mural costs to students would "be greatly reduced or 
eliminated." Lacking specific numbers or mforma-
ti n. voters do not know what this statement entai Is. 
$20 per team. rather than the current $25. may be 
considered a "a great reduction." Also, less titan 
seven percent of the proposed fee hike would actu-
ally go toward intramurals - an interestingly low 
number. con idering this is the angle supporters of 
the fce hike has emphaSized. Moreover, the current 
$25 fee I~ not an outragcou amount of money for 
people in intramurals because teams often split th. 
fee among thclJlselves. making the costs to individ-
uals negligible. The proposed $29.50 fee hike, how-
ever, is, con~iderable cost to the many students who 
have no interest in Intramural at all. 

long as this university remains a Division UI school 
- with no scholarships 10 auract a1hIeIes - no 
interest will be generated among swdents. Many 
UCSD teams have obtained outside sponsorships 
which provide uniforms, equipment and shoes. 
Teams with no such sponsors should consider ftnd-
ing one, rather than taking money from students who 
cannot afford it. 

Finally, the fiscally stupid A.S. would simply 
mismanage its proposed $4.50 A.S. allocation. The 
A.S. has wasted thousands of dollars on the pr0-
gramming office. which seemed to have no limita-
tions this year. and has handed out handfuls of 
money to anyone who asked for it - for example. 
the council approved $1,200 to the Objectivist Club 
for a conference. Until the A.S. learns to manage the 
money it does have, the student. body oUght not give 
it an opportunity to squander more. 

Every year, students hear the same tired rhetoric 
- the A.S. is on their side in the fight against fee 
hikes levied by the regents. However, every year, it is 
the same A.S. which feels p3l1ldoxically justified in 
attempting to raise its own taxes on the tudents. The 
Glli1rriiiln urges a "no" vote to the fee referendum. 

CONSTITUTION 
MEASURE A 

The new constitution would require president 
and vice-president admini tralive candidates to 
run on the same slate, give the president and vice-
president the power to appoint commissioners. and 
allow the A.S. to amend the constitution much 
more easi ly than before. 

To emulate the federal government is not in the 
best Interests of the student body. The needs of a 
nallon and of a student body differ greatly. For 
Instance, requiring presidential and vice-president 
admintstrative candidates to run on the same slate. 
as our federal Constitution does. eliminates quali-
fied independent candidate from the campaign . 

Sport clubs and intercollegiate teams arc of even 
les. in terest to tudents than intramurals. No one 
attends home garnes. and few students come to_ 
UCSD expecting a sports-oriented campus. And as 

And commi SSioner would be appointed by the 
president and vice-president rather than be elected 
by the student . One argument for the appointment 
of commissioners is that the president would be 
able to hire the most qualified student to carry out

the duties of Ihe commission. However, elections 
weed outlhe good from Ihe bad in Sludent govern-
ment because more people have a say in their rep-
resentation. If the commissions become appoinled, 
then the possibility exists that only the select few 
- the friends of the president and the vice presi-
dent - may be candidates for the job, despite their 
qualifications. Nepotism has no place in student 
government. 

Allowing theA.S. to amend the constitution on 
a whim. rather than through elections, is only the 
first step toward non -representation. Currently, in 
order for a constitutional amendment to be passed. 
two-thirds of the voting students must vote in a 
favor of it. In the new constitution, a proposed 
amendment must collect the signatures of ten per-
cent of the student body, then pass the senate with 
a two-thirds vOle. This makes changing the rules 
by which the government governs too easily 
achieved. 

Thc obstacles which the current constitution 
places before the A.S. have prevented it commit-
ting anti-student acts for years, like raising the stu-
dent activity fees. We do not need an A.S. Council 
which can do what it will without answering to the 
students. The (juardian urges a "no" vote on 
Constitutional Measure A. 

CONSTITUTION 
MEASURE B 

This amendment would allow the vice-presi-
dent extemalto serve as or appoint another student 
to represent the campus at the University of 
California Student Association (UCSA). In the 
current constitution, the president holds that par-
ticular power of appointment. 

Obviously, the UCSA representative position 
should fall into the realm of the A.S. external 
office. Funhermore. the UCSA representative and 
the vice-president external ought to be filled by the 
same person, thereby creating a unified front to 
both the A.S. and the state. Most UC schools 
already carry this provision in their respectiveA.S. 
Constitutions. The Guardian urges a "yes" vote on 
Constitutional Measure B. 

No, I don't UCSA has made a lot of signifi-
cant improvements in the past. In fact, at this 
point in time. if the A.S. fee were increased, I 
would even consider an increase in UCSA fund-
ing, speciflCally for lobbying regents. 
Ale you In hMIr of mInortty padudonI 
and A.S. fundIrC for them? 

I am. The reason being. you get into a really 
dangerous game when you start picking and 
choosing wh31 groups the A.S. will fund. As long 
as it's an activity that's open to all students -
whether the students want to corne or not - it 
needs funding. Because if you get a certain faction 
on A.S. council that doesn't like whatever a spe-
cifIC organization is doing, or they have ideologi-
cal differences with it, they could essentially use 
that as precedent to cut funding for other things. 
Say a IkInhead group came to A.S. to 
hIMI Its own paduatIon. It', IOiIC to be 
open to everyone. Would you fund It? 

Yes. That's the approach you have to take 
when dealing with student funding. People 
would also have the right to protest that and to be 
honest, I don't think that it would happen again, 
because there would be so much tudent opposi-
tion to it. But unless you violate some rule with-
in the funding process, you can't discriminate. 
Do you w.rt to hold Town Han meetings, 
In light of the recent faIlure of this yuo's 
attempt? 

No. No matter where theA.S. mects, students 
are not going to nock to it. unless they have a 
vested interest in something. Moving the meet-
ings around campus is a really dumb idea 
because not only is it not going to attract more 
students, but its going to confuse the students 
who already would like to go to the meetings. 

If we want to be more representative of stu-
dents, we need to go to them. Ask them what 
they feel about certain issues. I' ve been doing 
that ever since I've been at this school, and ever 
since I've been involved in student government. 
And that's wh)' I've been able to accomplish so 
many things, because I know what people are 
upset about.

Though neither candKate has named fiscal

specified amount of funding for this office. 
Currently the Marshall College programmer, Lee

office for the lasl two years. Defining her music 
taste as ranging from hip-hop to altemative, Lee 
says she will involve students in the programming

The second contender in this race. Ala Serio,

Feldman who has the experience. enthusiasm and

think it's unfair to ask Ihe students to pay more. If 
you have a business thai's going broke. you don't 
look back to the people who broke it to fix il. You 
look outside to new ideas, to new innovations. If 
we elect these other candidates, lheir experience

Trinity Tops 
Tritons in AZ 
PHOENIX: UCSD swung to 
a weekend split against old 
Division ill rivals in Arizona 
By Den KrIIft 
Sports Editor 

The weekend of the Phoenix Invitational 
has become a seasonal check-point of sorts for 
the UCSD women's tennis team, and this year's 

edition was no exception. 
'The invitational was actu-

ally not so much a toumament as 
it was a pre-scheduled show-
down among top teams from 
both the men's and women's 
sidesoflhe NCAA tennis world. 
For the Tritons, it meant match-
ups against old nemeses 

Gwtavus Adolphus and Trinity University,both 
of whom were beaten by UCSD en route to its 
NCAA title last season. This year, the Triton 
women split the two matches, falling to Trinity 
on Saturday afternoon after taking care of 
Gustavus in exciting fashion on Friday. . 

"We always use this weekend asa way to get 
ready for nationals," UCSD Head Coach Liz 
LaPlante said. "Losing to Trinity will really 
make us wade. harder to get ready for NCAAs, 
especially because the girls are all seniors." 

On Friday, it was Gustavus which stood 
across the net from the Tritons; and, afterfalling 
behind early, UCSD rallied in the singles 
matches to grab the slim victory, 5-4. The 
doubles matches provided Gustavus the oppor-
tunity to gain ground on UCSO: as it took two 
of the three pro sets to grab a 2-1 lead in the 
match entering singles play. Miki Kurokawa 
and Yumi Takemoto comprised the only Triton 
doubles team to gain a victory, a slim 9-8 
triumph over Lisa Broughten and Erin Janes. 

With the overall loss in the doubles matches, 
UCSD knew it needed to win four of the six 
singles contests to take the win. Michelle

scoring three runs in the first inning. 
Triton pitcher Mary Jane Otto shut out 
the Lancers to help UCSD roll to a 5-0 

Once again, the Tritons committed 
no errors in the field and preserved

play which cut short a dangerous Lancer"

Senior Mike Bryant started 
the opener against the Bulldogs' 
SCOll Sasser. Both teams traded 
leads early, with each squad pull-
ing ahead on three different oc-
casions. 

ton closer Andy DeGruIe could 
DOt hold off the Bulldop Illy 
longer, and Redlands woo tile same 
with a sacrifice fly in the bottom of 
the 10th. 

Similar to the way UCSD won 
its previous games, Redlands got 
a lead-off double, sacrificed the 
runner to third and drove him in 
with a clutch at-bat to take the 
victory. 

"Once DeGrasse went two in-
nings, we knew we couldn't use 
for the nightcap so we let him 
pitch," Triton Head Coach Robert 
Retcher said. "We had a pitcher 
reday for the 11th inning, but they 
scored in the 10th. [DeGrasse] 
pitched well for the time he was 
out there." 

From the outset of the contest, 
it was clear that the visitins 4gers 
were not about to play down to 
their Division 111 opponents. Be-
fore either team even broke a 
sweat, the Tritons found them-
selves in a hole down five points, 
as the Long Beach State frontline 
quickly established itself as a huge

In the top of the sixth inning, 
however, the Tritons seemingly 
put some distance between them-
selves and the Bulldogs when 
they scored three runs to take a 
7-4 lead. 

The Triton offense was led by 
senior centerfielder Jason Apilar

"They blocked us off the court." 

Head Coach Doug Dannevik said. 
"They are the third-ranked team 
in the nation, and are every bit thai 
good." 

Against such a dominating 
frontline, the usually strong pass-
ing of the Tritons quickly became 
suspect. Long Beach State 
pounced on this weakness to take 
the first game, 15-7. 

only got worse as the match pro-
gressed. The UCSD frontline was 
never able to put up a strong block-
ing defense, which led to its over-
whelming defeat in Ihe second 
game, 15-2. 

The 49crs th.en struck gold with 
a ncar-perfect final game, as they 
made only two hitting errors en

hapless Tritons, who could only 
manage a hitting percentage of

the 4gers on their heels, and he 
also put away fi ve ki 115. 

"Neal came to me and asked for 
an opponunity to play," Dannevik 
said. "He did all of the things he 
needed to do in practice and took 
advantage of his opponunity and 
played very well." 

The Tritons face cross-town ri-
val San Diego State - a team they 
upset late last year - tomorrow in 
their final home match of the sea-· 

. The three-run margin proved 
to be shon-lived, however, as 
Redlands came back with three 
scores of its own in the bouom of 
the inning on a RBI ground-out, a 
wild pitch IJId a UCSD error. The 
score remained knoned for the nexi 
three innings, sending the contesl 
into extra innings, tied up at seven 
apiece. 

UCSD stayed close with the 
Bulldogs in the nightcap, but 
Redlands broke open a 3-2 game 
with four runs in the bottom of the 
fifth to take a commanding 7-2 
lead.

BLACK: Beach 
may be next for senior 
ContInued from ..... 20 

Impressive stalistics aside, Black 
has brought a dimension of experi-
ence and leadership to a squad com-
posed primarily of underclassmen. 
Black's teammates recognized his vi-
tal role on the squad by selecting him 
as the tearn ' s captain, a distinction he 
readily accepts. 

"I think the other guys respect 
Tom both as a player and a person," 
UCSD Hcad Coach Doug Dannevik 
said. "He is the hean and soul of the 
leam." 

Anyone who has attended a Triton 
volleyball game know~ that Black is 
the type of player who wears his hean 
on his sleeve. He is the first to lend 
encouragement to teammates and be-
rate himself for even the slightest of 
miscues, anribules indicativeof a team 
leader. 

''Tom is a player with an intense 
competitive desire," Dannevik said. 
"He has such a strong will to win." 

But for Black and his teammates, 
who arc the only Division ill players 
in the Mountain Pacific Spons Fed-
eration (MPSF), the wins have been 

. .. I 

few and f. between. 
" think IhII [1osin8] has been !he 

hardest paIt." Black said. "But !he 
guys are great. We've really come 
together as a team." 

Despite not having the winning 
percentage to match his all-out ef· 
forts, Black has still etched his name 
into the Triton volleyball history 
books. Twice during the course of the 
season he equaled his own school 
record for kills in a match; and earlier 
in the year, Black surpassed the record 
for kills in a career. He currenlly has 
1,200 career kills, with the 482 kills 
from this season being a school record. 

The UCSD Guardian 

greIl deaJ of.,.... BIKIt sIIugIed 
to findc:onsistcncyinhispme. When 
Dannevik took over. head COIdIIhc 
next year, he met with Black to dis-
cuss !he idea of swik:hinI positions. 

-..II1II10lI0I'I'''' he hid one of 
!he most excilinB momenta of his col-
IeJiaIe c:arcer, as Ihc Tritons faced 
volleyball powerhouse UCLA. 

''We traveled up to Pauley Pa\jl-
ion to play UCLA." Black 
said, "and we stole a game 
from !hem. I was able to get 
the game-winning kill." 

Although his time at UCSD was 
very successful, Black's original col-
lege plans did not include a stay in La 
Jolla. As ajuniorat Crespi HighSchool 
in Reseda, Black had attracled the 
attention of many top Division I 
schools. A broken ankle during that 
year made many of the programs re-
luctant to pursue him. And despite a 
strong showing his senior season, 
Black decided 10 play volleyball in 
San Diego rather than to pursue a 
Division I career elsewhere. 

When asked about the 
highlights of his career at 
UCSD,!he unassuming Black 
does not mention indi vidual 
awards or honors; instead he 
recalls his time spent coordi-
nating an elementaryschool 
physical-educalion program. 
As a member of the Triton 
Athletes Council, Black is 
chairperson of the Commu-
nity Outreach Program.ajoint

ment He was also named to the a11-
tournament team in !he Mizuno Invi-
tational, in which !he Tritons advanced 
to the championship match. 

As the season winds down, the 
accolades for Black are sure to con-
tinue pouring in, even after the year is 
over. He has been nominated for the 
all-conference team in the MPSF, and 
he is considered a lock for Volkyball '

"I'd like to go to Europe and play 
professionally," Black said. "And I 
want to play on the A VP (beach vol-
leyball) tour. After that, I'd Iilc:e 10 go 
to law school." 

Always the reluctant hero, Black 
refuses to place himself before the 
learn. As he closes out his tremendous 
career at UCSD, Black will be re-
membered a.~ one of the greatest Tri-
ton athletes of all time. Of course, 
he'd never tell you that.

TRINITY: UCSD

and number-two Kurokawa got the 
ball rolling in the right direction, as 
each captured convincing straight-set 
victories over her Gustie opponent 
MaIenphansakuJ lopped Brouahten, 
6-2,6-1 , while Kurokawa beat upon 
Sarah Lobllnd, 6-1, 6-2. 

HilII)' Somers earned a point for 
UCSD by liking Janes out in three 
sets, S-7, 6-1, 6-3; but teammates 
Kurobwa and Annie Hoecker (bal-
tling a foot problem) weren't able 10 
get the a11-imponant founh victory. 

This pul all the pressure on Susan 
Huberman, playing in the number-
five slot, to win and pull out the vic-
tory for the Tritons. She and Angie 
Dudeck split sets one and two before 
Huberman tepped it up. 

"[Huberman] got up quickly in the 
third set and took care of IDudeck]." 
laPlante said. 

The 6·7, 6·4. 6-3 vidory by 
Huberman granted UCSD the win: 

The next day, theTrltons faced off 
against one of the nalion 's best in 
Trinity. In conlrast to its performance 
the previous day against Gustavu , it 
was UCSD which sprinted out of the 
starling gate to win two of three 
doubles matches, only to fall apart in 
the singles, losing five of six. 

"We always seem to lose to them 
in this tournament," LaPlanle said. 
"And then we always draw them in 
the NCAAsand win. We really wanted 
to beat them in this tournament. We 
were d!sappointed nOlto pu II off some 
of those singles matches." 

The UCSD doubles wins were 
achieved by the tandems of 
Malenphansakul/Huberman and 
SommersIHoecker. However, Somers 
was lhe only Triton capableof a win in 
singles, as she played what LaPlante 
tenned "the best malch she 's ever 
played, " thoroughly dominati ng Tri n-
ity freshman, Lola Tay lor. 

Kaala Potashnik (filling in f~r 
Hoecker at number six), Huberman, 
Takemoto and Malenphansakul all 
fell in straight sets , with only 
Kurokawa being able 10 extend her 
opponent from Trinily to the third set 
before eventually falling. 

The defeat left UCSD at9-6 on the 
season, and the match was likely 
Trinity's tickct to the number-one seed

tournament time.
