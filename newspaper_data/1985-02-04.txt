!e We the people of the Associated Students ... 
On February 19 and 20, UCSD students will have an 

opportunity to ratify a new ASUCSD constitution , a 
document that has been in the works for three years. To 
go into effect, the constitution must receive the majority 
approval 6f at least 20% of the student population in the-
referendum vote . 

Accord ing to AS President Marc Boroditsky, 
outstanding growth of the campus has made the existing 
constitution obsolete. Its missing element, he says, is the 
precise delegation of aumority which is necessary to 
ensure a more efficient government that is best suited for 
the students. 

Last year, me revising committee working on the 
document was comprised of about six core students, 
many of whom are currendy active on the AS board. 
Other members were students with diverse interests who 
volunteered their input. 

Robin Newland, commissioner of elections, put 
banners up and sent leners to every UCSD student 
announcing the referendum meetings last quarter. The 
letter urged participation and reminded students that 
"any person duly registered as an undergraduate at 
UCSD shall be a full voting member of ASUCSD." 

A detailed outline (or the new constitution was created 
by Ken Davenport, a political science major here at 
UCSD. As an independent study project , Davenport , in 
conjunction with Peter Irons, associate professor of 
political science at UCSD, researched the constitutions 
of UC schools as well as mher universIties. 

Davenport came up with a new set of guidelines that 
can handle the fast pace and increased number of 
students involved in UCSD's growth. The development 
of the UCSD campus direcdy affects the growth of the AS . 
Bomditsky said. 

Boroditsky pointed out that the present document 
outlines the duties of the president and vice preSident 
only. In contrast, the new constitution clearly specifies a 
division of responsibilities. The new plan includes ten 
offi cers as well as nine ex-officio members of council. 

The new document states that one president will 
preside with three vice presidents below him, each 
controlling a different area of student government: (l) 
external affairs; (2) administrative affairs; and (3) the 
finance committee. Next in line in the hierarchy are six 
co mm iss ioners who regulate public relations , 
communications, programming, academic affairs , 
operations/ services and enterprises, and the UniverSity 
Center Board . Final authOrity still lies in the hand s of the 
legislative committee. 

AS-related organizations generate $700,000 and 
manage 150 budgets. Wim all of these responsibilities, 
time management is important. Boroditsky said that 
80% of his time during meetings is spent on financial 
concerns. If these issues could be sorted out in their 
appropriate committees before they reach the general 
meetings, conference time could be spent more 
efficiendy, he said. 

A section in the new constitution titled "Conflicr of 
Interest" prevents an officer from voting on an issue that 
he or she is i nvalved in by title. 

Anmher noteworthy change is the idea of having four 
senators (formerly referred to as representatives), each of 
a different class standing, from each coBege. This way, 
AS members will be more diverse and aware of different 
aspects of UCSD. 

During the late '60s and early 70s, the AS was voted 
out and turned into a co-op. Anyone could be an official 
of the board and maintain power to vote after anending 
only three meetings. Although this encouraged student 
involvement, it resuhed in the lack of a cohesive student 
organization. 

In 1977, with a different politically active student 
body, the AS was voted back in again. The AS 
constitution was wrinen in one night, Boroditsky said, 
adding that it is "filled with loopholes and 
contradictions. There is no point in amending a 
worthless document." 

If approval from the majority of students voting in the 
upcoming referendum is not obtained, or if less than 
20% of the stlldent body votes , then the existing 
constitution will remain legal and more revisions will 
have to be made on the new proposal , Boroditsky said .

Star Wars defense 
analyzed by IGee 
By JOSEPH ROMM 

T WO RECENT SPEAKERS at the InS lilute on Global ConflIct and Coopera tion hoth suggested Ihat 
the MX missile might be un necessary 
and that the Soviets oppose Star Wars 
because they are afraid of the United 

ta tes' technological superiority. 
Last Wed nesday, professor Wilham 

Niere nberg, di rector of the cripps 
Instllution 01 Oceanography, spoke at 
length about the hIStory of the MX missile. 
He argued that the MX missile was 
essentially deSigned by Ihe SALT I and 
SALT II treaties . Those treaties allowed 
only one new land-based missile, with a 
maximum of len nuclear bombs 
(wa rh eads) on each miSSile , and no new 
silos to house the new mIssile . 

The MX missile carries ten warheads 
and is just about the largest possible 
miss ile that can fit in the existing 
Minuteman silos. 

iere nberg suggested th:lt the MX 
missile is due lO the SALT treaties, 

.1 

rather than any particular military 
neceSSity. He said he would prefer Ihat 
the US backfit the existing Minuteman 
Missiles with MX guidance systems, at a 
COst of perhaps $3-$7 billion rather than 
spending $30-$60 billion on'the MK 

LaSt Tuesday, Leon Sloss, or Leon 
loss Associates, Inc .. ArlinglOn, Virginia, 

prese nted the results of a se ries of three 
semina rs in WashingtOn, D.C. on 
negotiating with the Soviet Union. The 
most interesting conclus ion of the 
parti cipants was that weapons labeled as 
"bargaining chips" are not va luable if 1) 
they are built solely fo r bargai ning 

purposes, or 2) the side building the 
weapon does not Intend lO bargain it 
away. 

Alth ough Sloss did not make the 
connection himself, the MX missile fa ll s 
into one of those [WO categones Most 01 
Ihe Congressional suppo rters of Ihe MX 
see (he MX as havi ng little poli tical or 
mIlitary use other than as a bargaining 
chi p. The Reagan Admintstration has 
sta led many times, however. that It has 
no inte ntion of givmg up the planned 
100 MX missiles (and the AI r Force has 
staled thaI II wants 200 MX missiles) . 

As for Star Wars, 'or the StrategiC 
Defense Initiallve, as the administration 
calls it , Sloss fee ls the SovIets are trying 
to return to the 1972-19a3 regime of the 
1972 Anti -Ballistic MISSIle (ABM) treaty. 
where. he says, the Soviets uSed every 
loophole lO build their defense.:; ag~ nst 
balli stic missiles while we di smantlej:l 
our ABM sy~tcm in Gmrl(j' Â·Fooo, North 
Dakota. Nierenberg expresse4 a very 
similar view. Both men support Star 
Wars and claim th<;t t it wQuld not 
stimulate an escalanon of the arms Â·ace . 

Sloss also prese nted bne often : 
neglec ted fact~me existmg A8M trtaty 
.already b!1_n ~ s l?a~c-bascd balli ~i c I 
missile defertse, wh rc h the 'Star Wars 
program would ei1tail. The general ; 
public seems to believe mat me Soviets 
might give some offe nsIve weapons in 
return for a ban on tar Wars weapons: 
this is nm the case. The oviets are not 
going to give up some existing weapon 
system in return fo r US adhering to the 
te rms of a treaty it signed over ten years 
ago. ~

Sending innocent lambs to slaughter? 
Here at the Guardian we are always pleased when we receive a 

barrage of letters concerning our editorial convictions. Here at the 
Guardian we are extremely pleased when the groups or individuals we 
have publicized decide that it is within their best interest to defend 
their virtuousness by mailing us their retractions. You see, we don't 
believe in infallibility. We are a collection of skeptical, inquisitive, 
doubting Thomas's. You might say that we can be overly zealous in our 
presentation of moral and ethical questions. That is because we hold 
that the practice of ethics is pan of political praxis-a process of 
progressive values in constant motion . 

For us, there are no half-truths; we do not retract our statements 
because the practitioners of a deceptive act claim naivete about the 
"proper proceedings." What is stunning is that the group claiming 
innocence and bewilderment over the accusations made in the Guardian 

is the very one whose peers control the most important political offices 
in the United States! It reminds one of Richard Nixon kneeling on the 
floor of the Oval Office with Alexander Haig, praying with all their 
heans for absolvement of Dick's breach of national trust. Mr. Nixon 
desired the ultimate amount of power; he wanted to be seen as a 
faultless soothsayer in front of a uninformed flock. Dick felt that he had 
the key to the city engraved in his palm. Then he led his nation, and 
himself, into disgrace. 

There is an important lesson to be deduced from this tragedy: Leave 
the increasingly intelligent human population alone to develop its own 
beliefs. The only "saving" form of information that should be distributed 
to anyone is that which encourages the individual to consistently climb 
new branches on the tree of knowledge, to never StOP developing a 
unique epistemology, and to realize one's faults , fallibility, and the 
necessity of dispensing "information" with the utmost care.

If the God of Jesus Christ intends to 
save only those Christians who have 
undergone an emotionally charged "2nd 
baptism" and damn everyone else , then 
1 don't want to' have anything to do with 
him. 

However, If the God of Jesus Chnst IS 
the one who WIll Judge us neither on 
our religIOUS fervor, nor on what religIOn 
we belong to , but on how we "clothed 
the naked, fed the hungry and visited 
the imprisoned ," then us Christians had 
better look around and see how many 
non-Christian, Jewish , Moslem, agnostic 
or atheist friends and co-workers we 
have and how many we have alienated 
through patronizing or proselytizlOg. 
"Born again" or not , we may have a lot 
10 answer for.

How you vIew your world makes a 

world of dIfference. All of us wear a pair 
of glasses through which we .iew the 
world. And all of the data that comes to 
us is colored by the color of those 
glasses. What you would call an 
"illusion" is more correcdy called a 
"change in your glasses." It IS possible 
for all of us by an act of the will to tum 
10 the assumption upon which our 
world IS VIewed and exchange them for 
a new set. 

It is not wrong for a person to test or 
question his own pair of glasses (beliefs) 

against the facts, in fact It is healthy. 
That is exactly what Campus Crusade 
for ChrISt is doing when they ask 
another student to give their feedback 
on the Four Spiritual Laws or to consider 
the un iqueness of the person ofJesus 
Christ and the claims He made. 

ConSIder this, if you will , for JUSt one 
moment. If it is true that Jesus Chnst 
was God in the flesh and if He dId rise 
from the dead and solve the problem of 
sin , then it would be tragIc if a person 
were never told how to take advantage 
of that free gIft. 

The issue isn 't over solicitation, it's 
over information . The question could just 
as well be posed , "Do you feel it is right 
to withhold information that could help 
someone (suc h as a cure to cancer) on 
the basis that they should be man 
enough to figure theIr own way OUt of 
their own dilemma?" Americans have 
the attltude , far too often , that we 
should n't bother 10 throw in the life 
preserver but that we should watch out 
for ourselves 

Furthermore , we are not soliCiting any 
more than the Red Cross does when 
they ask if they can dispense aid to the 
starving or injured. We are dispensing 
information, not infringing on the rights 
of another. 

It's because I respect the other 
person's opinion that I share the Good 

ews with them. Univerisry students 
don't need to be sheltered from the 
arena of thought by banning religiOUS 
funding on campus. That won't do 
anything but take us away from the 
freedom of speech and the freedom of 
assembly our forefathers fought for. 

Berry Fiess 

Editor: 
In recent weeks in articles in the 

Guardian, we, the students of Campus 
Crusade for Christ, have been accused 
of both trying to deceive the AS and of 
outright lying to them regarding the 
performance of Andre Kole at UCSD. It 
".ppears the feeling is that we purpose ly 
withheld information about the religious 
nature of the final element of his 
perfonnance in an attempt to gain 
funding from the AS. 

On the issue of lying to the AS (as 
stated by Matthew J Cronin in his 
article on Jan. 28), we have done no 
such thing. We have not falsified any 
information to the AS in any way, and 
we ask Matthew to re tract this allegation . 

Also, we have not tried to deceive the 
AS as to the nature of Andre's 
performance. When we first began the 
paperwork to bring Andre to UCSD, we 
were told that due to the fact that we 
were selling tickets for the performance, 
we needed to receIve an underwrite 
from the AS In order to do so (We later 
found Ollt, during the interim between 
the twO AS meetings where this issue 
was discussed , that this was not 
necessary if we could provide our own 
undetwrite). We had applied for the 
underwrite and not direct AS funding. 
We were under the impression that an 
underwrite was not considered to be the 
same as direct fundi ng and therefore 
did not constitute AS sponsorship of our 
event. We approached the underwrite as 
something we needed to have (i.e. a 
formality) and as a financial issue (i.e . a 
loan whIch four of our members had 
agreed to be surety for). We did not 
reali ze that Andre's comments relating to 
spiritual matters would have any bearing

on this decision since we did not 
realize that we were in fact (as we 
discovered later) requesting AS 
sponsorship. Also , his perfomlance had 
been underwritten by the AS on a 
previous occasion, and we assumed that 
the AS would realize that any event 
sponsored by Campus Crusade for 
Christ would have something to do with 
Christiani ty. When questions were 
brought up as to the religious element of 
Andre's performance, we answered them 
truthfully and directly. Essentially, what 
has been viewed as things we were 
trying to hide from the AS were issues 
we did not realize had any bearing on 
the matter of an AS underwrite , 
especially in light of approval in the 
paS!. 

For those who are convinced that we 
have been deceptive in this matter, we 
cannot hope to change your minds, but 
only to ask that you give a thought to 
considering our perspective. 

For those who continue to refer to 
the "Assignment Life" issue of last 
year-you are correct, we did essentially 
everything wrong. However, whereas we 
have a new AS Council which shouldn't 
be associated with underwriting Andre 
Kole in the past , there is baSically a new 
student leadership in Campus Crusade 
which shouldn 't have past incidents 
held against them. The person 
responsible , now an alumni , has done 
his best to apologize and make amends. 
What more can we say?

Viewpoint 

You can eat now, or staNe later 
By JANET TAYLOR 

"To accept passively an unjust system is 
to cooperate with that system." 

-Marti" l. King 
Most people would agree with the above statement. 

But do people support their agreement with actions? I 
am inclined to answer that they do not. For example. 
over half of the eligible voters in the United States do 
not vote . Yet, one is constantly hearing complaints 
from non-voters (as well as voters) that our system is 
corrupt and taxes are too high. I'm tired of this "all 
talk, no action" attitude. Therefore, I plan to propose a 
solution to the current meal card dilemma that we, as 
UC San Diego students , face . 

depending on how many meals one is willing to 
purchase within a quarter. Instead of buying 14 meals 
per week one would buy 140 meals per quaner. In 
order to accomplish this, the present computer system 
must be reprogrammed to count meals per quaner 
rather than adding meal per period per week. Once 
this has been complered, the problems of time 
schedules and limited use will Significantly diminish 
because the card holder will be able to use the meal 
card at anytime he wishes. The only foreseeable 
problem is that students would have to be careful not 
to relinquish rheir meals too qUickly. But being the 
bright, gifted youths of UCSD , this shouldn't be a 

problem. 
There exists a problem within our Food Services 

system. Due to conflicting class schedules and limited 
use of the meal cards, we , as holders , are being 
unjustly restricted . The proposed is the definitive 
solution because it is inexpensive, feasible and has 
been used successfully at other Universities like UC 
Davis, UC Berkeley and Usc. So why don't we put 
these words into action? 

'The food in this place is really terrible. Yes, and such 
small portions. That's essentially how 1 feel about life." 

- Woody Allen 
Under the present policy, a meal card holder has 

the option of one of three plans: ten , 14 or 19 meals 
per week. Generally, the Food Service olTers three 
meals a day, Monday through Friday, with brunch and 
dinner offered on Saturday and Sunday. the cardholder 
has the option to dine in any of the three dining 
commons or in four restaurants, during the follOWing 
allotted times: 
Meal Hours 
Breakfast 
Lunch 
Dinner 
Brunch 

Commons 
7:15-9:30 
11 ' 15-1 :30 
4:30-6:30 
9:00-12:00 

Campus Restaurants 
7:30-10:30 
1l :00-3:30 
4:00-8:00 

The above time allotments are the only times in 
which a meal card can be utilized . O ften class 
schedules conflict. The Food Services unsuccessfully 
tries to suppress this problem by extending the meal 
hours of campus restaurants. However, these facilities 
do not accept meal ca rds on Saturday or Sunday. Also, 
In the campus restaurants , one is limited to an 
assigned eash value ra ther than an "all you can eat" 
poli y. For instance, during breakfast a card holder is 
allowed to purchase items up to 52 .20, lunch $3.30. 
dinner $3.70; whereas in the di ning commons one can 
eat as much as one wants. Furthennore , one is 
restrlcted to using the meal.card only once during a 
meal penod . So, If one wlshc~ ID purchase a snack at 
llam and a lunch al 2pm (using one's meal card) it 
would be ImpOSSIble , due to the fact that 11am and 
2pm are Ilmes deSIgnated to the same meal penou . 
Consider another uccu rrence In which this problem 
arises. A friend comes to UCSD for a visll . Bemg a 
proud Triton , you decide to treat your friend to a nice 
Warren Commons dinne r. Except unde r the curren! 
system, you cannot purchase two meals within the 
same meal penod, whi le your meal ca rd lays wastefully 
at your side. 

Under this current Food Service program we , as 
meal card holders are bei ng "npped 01T." Within thIS 
system, one cannot have a snack and a meal within a 
three hour span, one cannot lend one's card to others , 
one cannot usc one's card to buy a friend a meal. The 
current policy is unjust and wasteful and must be 
altered . 

I propose that our Food Services program implement 
a system much hke a b.mking system. At the beginning 
of each quarter, a student depOSits a certai n fee

Editor. 

I'm writing this in response to an 
editorial that was published in the 
Guardian last Monday entitled 'The 
Illusion of Christianity." While a major 
portion of the article concerns the 
CCCs presentation of Andre Kole , the 
author made numerous tatemems 
throughout the arti Ie that seemed in 
my mind to represent many of the 
mIsconceptions and problems people 
have in discussing the whole Issue of 
religion. I would like to address rhem 
and in domg so, touch upon rhe CCC 
issue. 

The first questlon I would like to raise 
oncems rhe issue of "the foolhardiness 

for Earth-bound creatures with finite 
minds to be forever debatmg the 
existence of an infinite God ." While 
usage of the word forever serves to lessen 
the force of the statement, one is still 
left with the idea that God is this 
infinite and inscrutable mystery that our 
limited human faculties can never really 
understand. I don't know about you, bur 
I have never truly grasped electronics. I 
can imagine a stream of electrons 
flowing down a wire but the exact 
physics is beyond me. But that doesn't 
keep me from using electricity and 
being able to come up with a rough 
model that gets across the essence of 
the situation. ow while you mIght 
argue that God is beyond electriCIty, 
electricity, as far as I know, has never 
tried to reveal itself to anyone, except, 
perhaps, by an accidental shock. A 
major tenet, however, of every Theistic 
religion listed 10 the article holds that 
God has through the ages revealed 
HImsel f and His desires for mankind; 
through the prophets in Judaism and 
Islam and the person of Jesus Christ in 
Christianity. Even given the weakest 
Idea of who God might be, it is usually 
granted that God is in some form 
"omnipotent" and that in some way or 
another (possibly through evolution) 
God created mankind. Given this, it 
would be ridiculous to assume that If 
God wanted anythmg from the people 
He created. He wouldn't have given us 
the capacity to understand at least the 
fundamental essence of who He tS and 

what He wamed. 
A different questlon that the article 

raises revolves around the issue of 
"heing Ie r alone ro make our own value 
Judgements." While on the outside this 
might sound quite nice, if we all rook 
thiS to be true, we would never have any 
differing opinions upon whtch to base 
these so called judgments. If, for 
example, you wanted to write a paper 
discussing the pros and cons of 
Capitalism. reading about it from a . 
Russian te tbook wouldn't be enough; 
one would need to get both sides of the 
issue. If these "solicltors who proclaim 
to know the truth" can't gIve their side 
of the question , a person will be making 
decisions with only a part of the 
available information and that does not 
constitute a value judgement. 

The last question that stood out in m)' 
mind was the statement that 
"solicitation stifles freedom and erodes 
culture ." If solicitation stifles freedom , 
then evety university around the COUntty 
is a prison. The whole basis for science 
and learning in general IS that of 
refuting false hypotheSiS. Did 
Copernicus and Ptolemy stifle the 
freedom of the Catholic Church by 
proving that the sun was actually the 
center of the universe? Did Einstein 
stifle the freedom of his contemporaries 
by shOwing that the majority of their 
opi nions were invalid? We pay $449.50 
a quarter to be taught by people whose 
life work is to stifle freedom in this way. 
One might argue that Christianity or 
any given religious view might be 
wrong, but if that is the case, the worst 
thing that could be done would be to 
take it out of the place where it can be 
discussed and disproved. Religious 
beliefs and opinions should be no 
different than science. If they aren 't true 
in the most objective sense of the word, 
then they are worthless (see I 
Corinthians 15:1-20). Universities don't 
support the philosophy that false 
theories should be left alone and that 
we shouldn't criticize their advocates; 
neither should religion. 

If anyone read the article I'm refernng 
to, they by now have probably noticed 
that I haven 't even touched upon the 
CCC issue . I must say that I agree that

CCC shouldn't have tried to pass Andre 
Kole off as merely an Illusionist. Bur 
from that point on , the alticle rambles 
and makes statements with no support. 
Eve n given the auspicious onset of the 
Kale performance. how does that taint 
the selling of tickets on the plaza? I've 
been out there selling tickets and his 
description of us "Sitting patiently on 
our pulpits" is ridiculous. Do the TKE's 
sir patiently on their pulpits while 
selling posters? Or do they fidget 
around? 

If it is true that "this morbid satire of 
supposedly graced children solicting 
students to fund a type of eva ngelism 
born of deception must end" then it is 
equally true that this inane "hands-orr' 
treatment of religion and the question of 
God should come to an end . There's a 
bumper stlcker out that says "friends 
don't let fnends d~lve drunk." But if 
that's true then why, If I am wasting my 
life believing and trying to live 
something that isn't true , should 
everyone leave me alone? If it is 
important for people to not allow their 
friends to drive drunk, think how much 
more important it should be to OJ' to 
help each other lead a life that is 
grounded on some form of reality. 

Winston Churchill , when asked about 
some of his greatest thoughts 
responded, "It i~ awesome to think that 
some day I might stand before God and 
be held accountable for the things I 
have done." If God exists, it is a brave 
step to assume that He doesn't want 
anything from us. And if God does exist 
and does have some purpose for us 
here on this Earth , then there is no 
question more worthy of discussion and 
thought than that of our relationship to 
this God.

Editor. 
Concerning: Opinions article 'The 

Illusion of Christianity" Oan. 28). 
Although I do not think of myself as a 

"mampulative angel: I am a Christian 
and a follower of Christ. I could not 
agree with you more on the issue of 
freedom and individual choice which 
was discussed in your last paragraph of 
'The Illusion of Christianity." Freedom is 

most worthy in the form of individual 
choiCe and people should and do have 
every right to decide for themselves the 
validity of a religiOUS faith. But in order 
to make a valid decision on any issue , 
one needs to be well informed of both 
sides of the issue and understand the 
impact that their decision will have on 
their life, no matter how major or minor 
the impact will be. 

As a Christian, I do occasionally share 
my faith with others, bur only if I know 
it is something they are willing to hear 
and have the time to hear it. I feel 
Christians are to be used as tools for 
those who do not know the Bible. If 
someone does decide to make a 
religiOUS decision in their life and yet 
does not have the time or the desire to 
read the Bible in order to be well 
informed, Christians can act as 
interpreters, briefly describing and 
informing them of what occurs and is 
said in the Scriptures. 

I am sorry if you have experienced 
evangelists in a negative manner. I 
realize that sometimes it is an 
inconvenience to the unbeliever who is 
unwilling to change, but there are others 
out there who will believe in the Bible 
and who have the right to make a 
decision after they have learned about 
what is involved in this issue. It is 
unfair to not let them hear and these 
are the people we as Christians are 
trying to reach.

Internships give students 
a look at the real world 
By CJ. OSTERWALDER 
"D ON'T LET COLLEGE get in 

the way of your education! " 
the fluorescent green flier 

reads. And on a brown rone-on-rone 
brochure. the ancient Chinese proverb 
states: "I hear and I forget, I see and I 
remember, I do and I understand ." Both 
the Ilier and brochure are advertising 
the merits of an academic intemship, a 
unique opportunity for college students 
to obtain on-the-job training in a 
professional , non-academic 
environment. 

Students can obtain a job with a 
company and work anywhere from ten 
to 30 hours per week, gaining valuable 
training and experience for a career 
after graduation. An internship is also a 
way to explore career choices without 
the pressure of having to commit 
oneself for more than ten weeks. 

There are two intemship offices on 
campus, and each offers a different kind 
of internship . The Academic Internship 
Program (AlP) office is located at 406 
Warren College (three buildings behind 
the Cashier's Office) and offers 
internships for academic credit, ranging 
from four to 12 units. The Associated 
Students Internship Office (ASIO) is 
located in the Student Center 
(immediately above the Game Room) 
and oITers students internships with or 
without academic credit. 

Both otTices have a wide variety of 
internship selections for all majors and 

career interests, ranging from public 
relations ro engineering. Panicipating 
organizations have included the 
American Securi ty CounCIl (in 
Washington , DC), Children's Hospital 
Language Research Laboratory, City of 
San Diego, San Diego Museum of Art, 
Smithsonian Institute. Salk Institute, San 
Diego Zoo, Southland Concens, 
Southwestern Cable , KGlV Channel 10, 
91X radio, Scripps Clinic, UCsD 
Medical Ce nter, Merrill Lynch Realty, 
Rolling Stone magazine, the Los Angeles 
Times and Harcoun-Brace-Jovanovich 
publishers. 

Although both AlP and ASIO have 
many of the same selections, each office 
also offers some jobs that the other does 
not. AlP has a larger total number of 
internships. Both AlP and ASIO will help 
students create their own internships in 
unlisted organiza tions. 

In order to qualify for an internship 
with either office, the applicant must 
choose an advisor. The advisor is then 
responsible for various duties which 
differ, depending on the type of 
intemship (credit or non-credit) and 
the office that the internship is listed 
with. 

Because its internships are always for 
academic credit, AlP requires applicants 
to have at least a 2.5 GPA with at least 
90 units completed. The advisor makes 
a list of selected readings which the 
student must complete during the 
course of the internship. [n addition,

Scientist earns military honor 
A Scripps Institution oceanographer received the US Navy's "Meritorious 

Civilian Service Award ," the highest civilian honor, during a ceremony held at 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography. 

Dr. Roben E. Stevenson, a scientific Iiason office r for the Office of Naval 
Research (ONR) and an oceanographic research associate at Scripps, was cited as 
having "played a key role in applying space technology to the solution of 
oceanographIC problems." 

The award was presented in conjunction with a scientific symposium on space 
oceanography, which featured speakers from the ONR, Scripps and NASA, 
including Space Shuttle astronauts Captain Robert Crippen (USN) and Paul Scully" 
Power, a civilian Navy oceanographer and research associate at 510. 

Stevenson, who was hailed as the "father of space oceanography in the Western 
World ," was one of the first American scientists to suggest that oceanographic 
measurements could be accurately recorded from spacecraft using remote sensing 
units. 

Stevenson has advised a number of agencies on space-related programs, 
including the National Academy of Science , NATO and NASA, and has done 
extensive work with the astronauts for the Space Shuttle program, briefing them on 
procedures for making oceanographic observations from space. 

- Susan Sullivan 

the student must keep a journal of work 
experience and also complete one, twO 
or three "projects" in order to receive 
four, eight or 12 units or credit. Projects 
may include , but are not limited to , an 
evaluative report that integrates theory 
from readings with practical experience 
gained , a "take-home final ," or a 
standard research paper with 
bibliography. The projectCs) and the 
journal are then evaluated by the 
advisor. In addition , the number of 
hours of "field work" (on-the-job 
experience) required per week is as 
follows: eight to ten hours for four units 
credit, 20 hours for eight units, and 30 
hours for 12 units. Regardless of class 
status, many majors will allow one four-
un it special studies course (such as an 
internship) to count as an upper-
division course towards the major's 

requirements. However, the internship 
can only be taken on a passi no pass 
basis, so H cannot improve one's GPA. 

Internships are available every quarter 
of the year including summer and are 
available nationwide as well as in San 
Diego. There is generally no monetary 
compensation for the internship; 
however, occasionally parking or 
mileage is reimbursed and sometimes 
there is even a small salary. 

The application deadline for AlP is 
the end of the fifth week, while the 
deadline for ASIO is the end of the 
foutth week. Most internshi ps require 

, the application only one quarter before 
the inte rnship begins, although , for 
instance, the Los Angeles Times requires 
the application two quarters 10 
advance. ~

T HE GUARDIAN has asked me to [de-print a new column chronicling [he events between UCSD's 25th and our soon to be 50th anniversal)'. Re-creating the past 25 years ofUCSD's history would be impossible without the use of the Ginelsohn Library's Histography 
Chamber, located in the Special Recollections section on the 14th noor.1 hope the chronicles 
presented in the follOWing weeks will entice those of you classified as under-minded 
scholars to make use of the chamber by exploring UCSD's past in person , or reserving 
time in one of the alternative histones which are available on loan from the Institute on

towa the targer. The first wave of REL terrorists 
unloaded their incendiary bombs, and then ascended 
into the heavens on the hot air currents of the burning 
laboratories. Through the smokey haze, the Hit-her Youth 
branch of the REL (known for their abusive verbal Slone 
throwing at women seeking abortions) could be seen 
collecting genetiC engineering vials. 

Two court cases arose OUt of the REL bombing. Salk 
Institute sued for damages, but the jU<jge ruled in favor of 
the REL, Citing the 1988 Cave Men (three California 
congressmen responsible for the 1985 bill banning 
abortions for minors) v. the Berkeley Birth Clinic ruling by 
the Supreme Coun legahzing non-fatality bombings. 

ParadoXically, the REL lawyers argued in the first case 
that the destroyed viru-cell vials should be defined as non-
human so as to rule the bombings as non-fatal ; yet, in the 
second cOlin case , they insisted the surviving viru-ceUs 
had a right to eternal life , which they concluded could 
only be realized through conception . The CJ37 donor 
protested that the origmal experiment was intended only 
to study blood cells. Creating a clone infringed on the 
basic rights and identity of an individual being. Does not

an individual retain control over every aspect of its being, especially as a victim of the REL's 
raping of the clinic? The donor pleaded to the JUry to abort this trial as a travesty on an 
individual's nght to its own body. The jury seemed to respond to the donor's plea, but the 
donor's fatal motOrcycle collision with a campus parking controller's vehicle swayed their 
sympathy tOward the donor's surviving viru-cell . 

The REL took the donor's death as a holy revelation that the viru-cell 037 should be freed 
from its corrupt scientifiC prison and implanted in a surrogate mother. A Hit-her Youth, 
Mary Josephson, was c hosen , as a reward for her rescuing the viru-cell during the Salk raid 
and her virgm status. Genetic engineering centers and pro-choice clinics offered help 
feanng the REL bio-creationist Raymond Jed might alter the genetic structure of CJ37 or 
endanger the mother Mary using his controversial triangle-loop forceps (nicknamed the 
"coat hanger"). Jed rejected the offer, preferring to conduct the operation as the main 
metaphor of a spontaneous generation illiusionist show, which was held on the chared 
rums of Salk. 

Three months later a zealot faction of the REL, citing the Genetic Orthadox Doctrine's 
(GOD) definition of a "proper birth ," began a campaign condemning Mary's pregnancy as a 
hypocrisy. Since Mary was a minor, and one of the most indoctrinated Hit-her Youth, the 
aborting of her pregnancy to save herself from the growing REL OUtcry was both politicaUy 
and religiously impossible. The REL tOok the ISsue to the Associated Students Church-State 
Council's Wednesday night meeting, asking for an excontinuation of Mary as a UCSD 
student, The subcommittee on GOD recommended three to one for excontinuation. In the 
fervo r of the CS council's overwhelming support of the REL, a voice from the crowd caBed to 
~Release mother Mary from her torment. Let her realize her right to eternal life now!" fleeing 
tntO the-naght, Mary was not seen unul SIX months later when the campus police discovered 
her body at the Salk site , stomach split open , as a ritualistic suicide, sacrifice, or Caesarean 
birth. That is how I began my life at UCSD and I begin this weekly column, Ii:)

Women's tennis is ... 

Rarin' to go 

By MATI ADAMS 

I N HER AVE SEASONS as head coach of the UCSD women's tennis team, Liz La Plante has guided the 
Tritons to national prominence. Her 
squads have garnered rwo second and 
one fifth place national finishes in the 
last three seasons. The 1985 team may 
be the strongest yet, as five of last year's 
top SIX players are return mg. Talent, 
depth and experience give UCSD an 
understandably optimistiC attitude about 
the upcoming season. 

The Triton's playa difficult schedule 
this year. Ir. this way, the team Will be 
better prepared for national competi tion . 
There are rwo schools of thought behind 
scheduling. First, you try to schedule as 
many cupcakes as possible so the 
seasonal record looks great. Dr. Tom 
Davis, basketball coach at Stanford, IS 
notorious for doi ng this every year, but 
It does not prepare his teams for their 
Pac-l0 schedule and they consistently 
fi n ish near the bottom of the league. 
The other way to put a schedule 
together IS to play the toughest 
competitlon pOSSible and become bener 
prepared for playoff competition Coach 
La Plante explains her philosophy. Â·We 
could eaSily go 20-0 every year by 
playing nothing but weak DIVISions 111 
teams. That would not prepare us for 
the national tournament where we meet 

tough schools outside of this area. By 
playing against tough Division I and II 
schools, we improve and the girls are 
much better prepared for the tough 
Division III schools that we see in 
nationals: The Triton schedule includes 
such strong DiVision I sc hools as USIU, 
CSU Long Beach, Western Michigan 
and UTEP. "We have a very realistlc 
chance of going to Nationals, and I want 
to be as prepared as possible, even if 
our record IS not the best in the nation ." 

A collegiate match features six singles 
matches and three doubles matches, 
each worth one team pomt for a 
pOSSible nine points per match. The top 
six players on the team participate m 
the match play. The Tritons return five 
veterans, including three All-Americans 
for their tough schedule. Here is a qUick 
look at the top Tritons. 

Glenna Moses is currently ranked it 1 
on the Tmon squad. Only a sophomore, 
Glenna hails from Los Angeles and 
compiled an Impressive 17-4 slllgies 
record last year. "I hope I can keep my 
concentration and Intensity up for each 
match thiS season. I think I Will be 
ready for the competitlon In the Singles 
at nationals." Glenna optlml~tlcaUy adds, 
"The nallonal team title IS In the bag." 

The veteran of the Tmon squad IS 

jessica Vernon (left) and Glenna Moses (above) will be two Tritons to watch as the 
women's tennis season gets underway. 

Nadi ne Akimoto. She is vying this 
season for a third consecutive AU-
American selection and is the Triton aU-
time career singles winner with 53 
victories. A San Diego product, Nadine 
is competing in her fourth and final 

- season as a Triton. "This is my last 
season and I would love 10 win national 
titles in both Singles and doubles 
(teamed with jessica Vernon). If I can 
stay healthy, I will push to become # 1 
on the team. But regardless , I want to 
have a good final season." Will you miss 
tennis next season? "I will always be 
playing in tournaments outside of 
school , so I will stay involved in the 
sport." 

Last season jessica Vernon spent time 
as both the team's #1 and #2 player. A 
senior, jessica was also a 1984 AlI-
American selection. Originally from San 
Diego, jessica spent time at UC Davis 
before transferring to UCSD. "I love 
being a member of this team. I am 
co nfident that we can get 10 the 
nationals, and win. Personally, I would 
like to become more consistent with my 
Singles play so I can be more 
competitive. I think we (teamed with 
Nadine) can win the national doubles 
title ." 

The third returning All-American is 
Lisa Gilbert, who is completing her last 
year of competition as a Triton. She 
hails from Los Angeles and last year 
posted a 19-9 mark (a record number of 
wins in a single season for a Triton). In 
just rwo years Lisa has compiled an 
impressive 34 viclOries for the Tritons. 

Returning for her second year of 
competition as a Triton is junior Melly 
Sani. Melly grew up in Pacifi c Grove and 
first attended Monterey Peninsula 
College before transferring to UCSD. At 
5'3", Melly is the smallest Triton . LaSt 
season she went 10-9 in regular season 
action. "I would like to play with 
confidence throughout the season. 
Hopefully I can peak at the righ t time, 
nationals. Nationals are a ways away so 1 
don 't want to risk bad luck and talk 
about them, but I think we have the 
depth this yea r to do what we couldn 't 
last year-wi n it all ." 

Freshman Maude Morns has been a 
very pleasant surprise for the Tritons. 
She has earned the only open position 
on the Tmon [cam. A freshman, Maude 
IS fr m San FranCISCo and has a very 
prOlnlstng career Jhead of her at UCSD. 

Also contributing to the Tmons IS 
vete r,lIl Brlgld Rea. Brigld is ongllla lly 

from Redlands and is in her junior year 
at UCSD. In the past two seasons, Brigid 
has won 33 matches, last year going 18-
7. 

Freshman Kelly Smith (a relative of 
the great Stan Smith), Karen Dodds and 
Deborah De Paoli, sophomore joan 
Belzer and junior Margaret Merickel 
round out the Triton roster. They 
provide the depth and future that makes 
for an optimistiC outlook for the 
program. 

The women's tennis team is one of 
the few teams on campus that receives 
substantial financial support from 
concerns outside the UCSD community. 
Coach La Plante explained , "Because we 
are consistently ranked among the tOP 
five nationaUy, and I belong to the 
Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches 
Association, Head provides our top six 
girls with $180 racquets. Adidas also 
provides us apparel at cost and free 
shoes. A fund raiser ne tted about $400, 
but the girls still had to pitch in their 
own money for sweats and uniforms." 

What about the facili ties here at 
UCSD? Are they adequate for the 
program? Coach La Plante responded, 
"We have inadequacies in several areas. 
First, and maybe most immediate, are 
the lights. Many of or matches last past 
sunset, and the lights on the Muir courts 
(where all home matches are played) are 
very poor. Second, the courts will 
probably need resurfacing soon, next 
year at the latest. Lastly, we simply don't 
have enough courts. Often at practice we 
have to share the Muir Courts with the 
men's team. That means we have only 
three COUrtS for 12 girls to play on. We 

-. CQuid never host the nationals here, 
either. The NCAA requires that to host 
you must have 12 coures on one site. 
We don't come close to that. It would be 
nice to have a center court with 
facilities for spectators also." 

The next Triton home matches are 
thi s Friday and Saturday at 2 and 10:30 
am respective ly. Coach La Plante 
continues, "We have done very well at a 
national level. but we stlll get little 
student interest. I understand that 
tennis is not as attractive for a specta tor 
as, say, volleyball , but if students take a 
Ilttle time, they can come OUt and see 
some very good tennis .md support 
thei r sc hool. I'm very OptllTiistic. I think 
we will be very good this year and will 
provide spectators wi th some excellent 
tennis." lID 

UCSD basketball 
is losing air pressure 

By MATI lAIT 

I F THERE WILL EVER BE a game to watch the UCSD Tritons play, it will be their rematch against the 
Southern Calitornia College Vangards. 
"We can take solace in one thing, and 
that is we get to play them again, at 
home," said coach Tom Marshall after a 
78-69 defeat against the Vanguards last 
Friday night in Costa Mesa. The game 
was a hard-fought ba[[le in which 
emotions ran high. 

From the start of the game, the 

Tritons were never able to get on track. 
UCSD was immediately taken out of the 
game by the hustle of the Vanguards, 
who took a 10-2 lead. Matters weren't 
helped by quick whistles from the 
officials, as the Tritons were in early foul 
trouble. 

After only three short minutes of play, 
UCSD center Mike Dabasinskas was 
tagged for his third personal foul. Dabo, 
dismayed with the closeness with which 
the referees were caUing the game, let 
his opinion be known and was given a 
technical foul and a rest on the bench. 

The Tritons pulled within one, only to 
let the gap slide back to 12, 32-20. The 
Vanguards' defense caused 12 turnovers 
in the first half alone. UCSD went into 
the locker room at the half trailing 40-
32, with four starters bearing the scars 
of three personal fouls . 

The second half was a replay of the 
first , with the Tritons behind the whole 
time. UCSD forward Mark Barreca 
promptly fouled out of the game. 
Marshall, like Dabasinskas in the first 
half, told the referee what he thought of 
the call and was slapped with a 
technical , giving the Vanguards their 
biggest lead of the night, 62-47. 

Were it not for the incredible play of 
Triton guards Brandon Nixon and Greg 
Kamansky, the game might have been a 
complete blowout. Nixon had a game 
high of 25, shooting 12 for 18 from the 
field , with Kamansky chipping in with 
12 points. 

The Tritons cut the lead to four 
several times but were unable to 
capitalize on the opportunities. The 
Vanguards played with impressive ' 
intensity throughout the game, and were 
thus were able to take full advantage of 
UCSD's untimely mistakes. 

"The officials called a tight game, 
which can hurt us because we have a lot
