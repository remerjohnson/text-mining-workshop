Steering System (DIM US), which 
is capable of distinguishing 
berween large numbers of sound 
sources beneath the ocean's 
surface . DIMUS, used in 
oceanography to rela te various 
underwater sounds with the 
physical properties of the ocean, 
is in the U.S. avy surface 
antisubmarine warfare ships and 
submarines. 

DIMUS was developed at the 
Marine Physical laboratory at 
Scnpps in the mid-1950s, and

Atari founder talks 
of future robotics 
By JOHN SHAW, StalJ Worer 

T HE makings of an entrepreneur were explored by ol,md 
Bushnell, founder of Atari , in a 
seminar sponsored by ACE , the 
AsSOCIati on of Collegiate 
Entrepreneurs , at Revelle's Why 
NOt Here? last Wednesday. 

Bushnell has founded over 20 
companies, including Ara ri, 
Chuck E-Cheese's Pizza 
Theatres, and his curre nt 
company, Axlon, which markets 
computerized pets. 

Many of Bushnell's companies 
have employed robOtics and 
computer technology Bushnell's 
present company is no 
excepti on. He has married the 
rapidly growing robotic industry 
with the $12 billion pet industry 
10 produce robotic pets. Bushnell 
estimates that "50 percent of 
domestic animals will be 
electronic by the year 2000." One 
cause for th iS pet revolution will 
be the fa t that Bushnell's pets 
"will be able 10 understand and 
speak Enghsh ." a feat he 
guarantees ordinary pets Will be 
Incapable of 

Bushnell took the hclm of 
Axlon In 1984 when it had a 

14 mtlhon deficit and 
transformed It Into a $14.5 
million ompany by 1985. 
Bushnell estimates that Axlon will 
do be tween $20 and 'li25 million 
of bUSiness this year. 

Although Bushnell has been 
remarkably successful with Axlon, 
he hasn't al\\'llys been successful 
in the robotics industty. In fact , 
he has lost '!i8 million pursuing 
his passion. "God doesn't want 
robots to come to ean h," said 

, Bushnell In an attempt to explain 
the in rcdible complexities of 
producing an intelligent robot. 
"When you say )'OU have a robO!, 
everyone expects R2-D2 ," he 
said . The fact is, the current 

intelligence of robots is thai of a 
slug." To overcome, or at least 
dlsguisc, thiS Intellectual 
shortco ming, Bushnell has 
manufactured his robots in the 
form of pets. 

In additi on to his 20 
co mpanies, Bushnell has 
founded and run many small-
time enterprises si nce he was six 
years old . HIS first enterprise 
involved selling strawberry plants 
that his neighbor was removing 
from his garden. 

Bushnell's creativicy has 
helped him immensely in his 
career, and he acknowledges that 
the whole idea of how to make 
money rests on this trait. In the 
fUlUre , creativity in problem-
solving will become ever more 
Imponant. Bushnell predicts that 
"less than two percent of the 
population will be involved in 
blue-collar jobs in the next 
twenty years ." This Will mean 
that more robots will be doing 
manual labor, and that more 
people will be needed 10 solve 
problems creati vely. 

Bu,hnell emphasized Ihat you 
can stan a business with 
absolutel), no mone)'. The trick IS 
to organi ze a group of 
knowledgeable people who can 
perform the necessary work for 
rou. As the organizer of thl 
group , you can nghtfull)' own 50 
percent or more of the co mpany. 

Another tip Bushnell oflered is 
to form a strategic alliance wim 
your strongest competilOr." 

Bushnell 'used thiS strategy 
with Atari . He founded Alan with 

~250 and sold a research 
co ntract to Bally, the largest coin-
operated , Video-game 
manufacturer at the time. 
Bushnell has agam formed a 
Similar alliance between Axlon 
and Hasbro, the largest to)' 
producer in the world . ~

Something lonely about "English only" 
For most of you who uike the time to 

rummage through our newspaper, it is very 
evident that our writers are not multilingual 
in the most classical of senses. Given the 
diversity of our writing styles, one might say 
that we employ a variety of lingos, like the 
Southern drawl , the Northeastern twang, or 
the Midwestern slurp , but we do not print 10 
either Spanish, Italian, French , Swahili, 
Chinese, or Quechua. This decision is not 
out of pure choice, however; it falls upon us 
to publish in English because our founding 
fathers d etermined with guns that th is would 
be the case. 

All of us here , as well as most of you, are 
products of the scourge of some colonial 
language. Proposition 63, or the "English-
Only" amendment, is only one more nail in 
the coffm of cultural diversity. Although 
proponents of the amendment claim that they 
want only to "officialize" the English language 
so as not to "waste taxpayers' money printing 
up voting materials (and the like) in four 
different languages," it is more of an attempt 
to "Waspize" our already disgustingly 
Waspish popular culture and government. 
Proponents act as if thiS nation hasn't already 
alienated 65 percent of our immigrant nation 
by presennng 1t with political leaders cast in 
the mold of a ftcnonalized , inept Bonzo, who 
never means what he says and never says 
what he means. We are here speakmg not 
JUSt of the dodos presently inhabiting the 
nation's cap ital, but of all U.S. leaders in the 
last 210 years who have chartered a negligent 
course of Manifest Destiny. 

There should be no doubt in anyone's 
mind that English will remain the most 
frequently used tongue in this nation for a 
long time to come , regardless of either 
minority separatist movements or right-Wing 
electoral attempts at funher centralizing the 
language of British royalty. Regarding the 
languages of . pantsh and Portuguese in Latin 
America, the English language, even with its 
history of enslavmg and i ncorporanng other 
cultures, is here to stay This does not, 
however, give Proposition 63 proponents 
license to de legltlmlze other languages 

(specifically, 10 thiS case, Spanish , 
Vietnamese and C hmese ), and thereby to 
condemn other cultures. 

We can lay blame at the fee t of our 
primary and secondary publiC educational 
systems for not historically teaching course 
in multicultural awareness and appreCiation , 
and for not making 1t mandatory for all 
students to master a language other than thei r 
mother tongue. Those voters who will choose 
to support Proposition 63 on ovember 4 will 
be more likel to do so Out of frustranon at 
not being able to understand or converse in a 
different language, or to appreciate a different 
perspective , than for any great love of 
English . In fact, if given a real choice, most 
voter would probably choose "American" as 
their official language of government, which 
is a funny and twisted combmation of over 
50 di fferent tongues. 

The opponents of Propositlon 63 have had 
an extremely difficult time convincing 
prospective California voters that the outcome 
of this issue may determine the fu ture of civil 
rights legislation in this state for a long time 
to come. If Proposition 63 does pass, it will 
likely do so with the vote of those women 
and men who vote against the reconfi rmation 
of Chief Justice Rose Bird, and progreSSive 
minority Justice Grod in and Cruz Reynoso. A 
vote of this nature could se t back the gains 
made by civil rights advocates by 15 years 
because minority groups will find state couns 
less accessible to them for redress of their 
grievances. The types of judges that Governor 
Deukmej ian will appoint, if he is re-elected , 
are bound to find a way to fit an "English-
only" amendment into their interpretations of 
the state Constitu tion. That, of cour$e , will 
spell doom for any future Cali fornia 
government determined to protect m inority 
culture [rom the tyranny of the majority. 

As opponents of PropOSition 63, we might 
do well to begin pnnting thiS newspaper in at 
least three different languages to show our 
de\'Qt\on to the beauty of cultural diversity. 
Smce we do not have a c; taff (If classical 
multJlmguists on hand , at least not yet, we 
can only suggest that each voter think about 

his or her own family'S cultural history before 
deciding at what pace, and at what cost, 
immigrants will be forced to learn English . 
We would ask you to vote '"no" on 
Proposition 63, and preserve the 
constitutionally guaranteed rights and 
privileges of all peoples. ~

PHO IOVOLTAICS: 
DAWN OF A NEW ERA. 
Since the beginning 
of time, man has 
sought ways to 
harness the power 
of light. Join us in 
accepting this 
challenge. 

We areARCO Solar, Inc., a 
subsidiary of Atlantic Richfield 
Company and the world 's leading 
manufacturer of photovoltaic 
modules. 

Due to our advances, solar 
electric (photovoltaic) energy is 
rapidly becoming the power supply 
choice for an expanding range of 
products and applications. 

Our photovoltaic modules serve 
as a dependable power source in 
everything from consumer elec-
tronics to utility power plants. 

We have committed major 
resources to furthering the devel-
opment of Thin Film Silicon (TFS) 
technology to make solar energy 
the power source of the future. 

ARGO Solar 's new TFS tech-
nology has the power to change 
perceived limitations imposed by 
conventional power supplies. 

Products and applications 
once considered impractical are 
now within reach . 

Scientists & Engineers 
Our success in reaching our 

goal depends largely on our Scien-
tists and Engineers. 

They are individuals with the 
ability to fuse theory and practice. 
They integrate new information and 
formulate new theories and concepts. 

Bachelor's and advanced 
degree candidates in: Physics, 
Chemistry, Computer and Material 
Sciences, Electrical , Mechanical 
and Electronic Engineering are in-
vited to meet with our Employment 
Representative.

The right choice. 

Rowing 
to 
Cincinatti 
By KAREN KUMM 

C rew at many East Coast sc hools is as big a sport as football . California 
rowers are not as acclaimed, but 
they do have the luxury of 
rowing year-round. Rowers in the 
Northeast can only row in the 
fall and spring. The wmter 
months are spent landtraining 
and practicing indoors in 
simulated rowing tanks. These 
months of indoor training make 
actual time spent on the watcr 
precious and valuable, fostering a 
more serious attitude about the 
sport. 

The University of Washmgton 
and UC Berkeley are usually the 
top twO rowmg schools in the 
West , and are the only ones who 
stand a chance against the 
Eastern tcams. Any school can 
compete at ationals, and last 
yea r, coach Linda Lyman 
decided that UCSD needed some 
exposure at the event. The 
novice women had finished a 
successful season in the West 
Coast events, and had the 
determination to compete agamst 
the East Coast schools. 

When asked how it felt to take 
a boat to Nationals, Lyman 
hesitated . "As far as fulfilling a 
hfe's goal or something, I didn 't 
really look at it that way. I tOok 
the girls to ationals to give 
them the opportunity to race the 
big schools. They came back 
with the desire to return this 
year and train even harder. We 
set a standard for the program. 

The trip to Ci ncinnati was nOt 
a vacation; the schools kept to 
themselves, and no one was 
overly friendly. Most of the 
schools had been practicing on 
the course for two weeks. "We 
were intimidated at first by the 
condescending attitude of the 
East Coast rowers," admitted 
Christy Duek, st roke of last year's 
novice boat. Being the only 
novice women from California, 
they felt very excluded. They 
turned quite a few heads at the 
race , though, and feel that in this 
way they achieved their goal. 

Duek and Lyman both 
emphaSized that the Eastern 
a tlitud~ is UJuch more intense, 
attributing to their supcri Jri ry In 
rdcing .. The goal this ye:.If for the 
women's crew is to adapt a 
similar altitude about racing and 
traming. and they expect to see 
results. The trip to Cincinnati 
was successful because it g,IVe 
UCSD some recognition, it ~ct a 
standard for our program. and 
the wome n learned from the 
Eastern approach to crewi ng. 
Nationals this year Will be held 
In Sacramento, and the women 's 
varslry is planning to be 
there ~
