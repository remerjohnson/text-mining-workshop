Students and alcohol: 
• •• • an IntrIguIng mIxture 

By CARMELIT A ROSAL 
taU Writer 

You've just finished your 
third midterm in three hours. 
You've spent the la t sixty 
minutes filling three 
bluebooks with mankind's 
amassed knowledge of Peru's 
lima bean industry. An hour 
has passed since you crunched 
numbers (and you r brain) in a 
futile attempt to fi nd some 
significance in E instei n 's 
theory of relativity. And now 
you can't even remember what 
your fir t midterm this 
morning was about. 

You stumble back to your 
dorm room, eyes glazed and 
tongue hanging out. Fishing 
for your room key in a Kleenex-
filled pocket, the image of the 
tall, cold gla s of liquid 
refreshment that await ' you 
within your mind. Ye , it' 
Miller time - or Budweiser 
time, or Jack Daniels time, or 
Smirnoff time, or .. .. 

It' no ecret. Student at 
UCSD - like a lot of people in 
t he real world - use alcohol. 

orne u e it a a relaxant after 
a hard week of studying. orne 
use it as an occasional e cape 
from the cold reality of 
academic life. Some ju tabu e 
it. 

But whatever the specific 
case, alcohol doe play a 

ignificant role in student life 
at UCSD, as it does at most 
colleges and universities. And 
becau e it i a part of student 
life, there must be administra· 
tive policy to control it. That is 
the way of the University. 

In this instance, however, 
the administration does not 
derive any perverse pleasure 
from enforcing its will on the 
university's student popula-
tion. It is a matter of genuine 
concern to them. Alcohol use 
and abuse by college students 
here and throughout the 
country is a real problem. 

One current administrative 
nightmare induced by the 
presence of alcohol on campus 
concerns the use of outdoor 

pace for functions at which 
alcoholic beverages will be 
erved. A clearly-defined 

univer ity policy governing 
indoor consumption of alcohol 
ha been in place for several 
years. It i only now, though , 
that the problem of managing 
an outdoor ocial event with 
alcohol are being add res ed. 

A part of the new Vice 
Chancellor of Und rgraduate 
Affair po ition created la t 

eptember, current VCUA 
Josep h Watson has been 

char~ed with developing a 
consIstent outdoor alcohol 
policy. 

As a clarification of thi new 
policy, specific location 

around campus ha\e been 
designated \\'herc student 
ocial events in\olving 

alcoholic beverages may be 
held . 

Included in the list of "safe" 
areas are the four college 
quadrangles, the "hump" 
between the Student Center 
and the Main Gym, the Muir 
Recreation Field, and the 
grassy area between Urey Hall 
and the Main Gym. The new 
policy s t ates that an 
organization sponsoring an 
event at one of these locations 
must provide seven people 
who will be responsible for 
enforcing California' legal 
drinking age by checking valid 
iden tification cards. 

In years past, only three 
per on ' from an organization 
were required to upervi e an 
even t. The ne\\ pol icy 
requiring even student 
upervi ors i hoped to provide 

better coverage and comply 
with university and tate 
regulations. 

Notably mi ing from the 
li st of approved outdoor 
alcohol consumption ites are 
two location: the Central 
Library patio and the 
Mandeville Center alcove -
al 0 known a the '·pit." 

The Central Library patio 
has been a prime location for 
large all-university parties in 
past years, but was eliminated 
from the approved Ii t because 
of student safety con idera-
tions, according to university 
officials. 

Effective crowd control is 
hampered there due to the 
three rather wide entrances to 
the patio, and the 20-foot drop 
of two sides of t he patio pose a 
danger to students who migh t 
"act and behave erratically 
under the' influence of 
alcohol." 

"The risk outweigh the 
benefit of the place that has a 
limited acce s factor," says 
Julie Gordon, Warren College 
dean. 

In addition, admini trator 
are con cerned a bou t the 
approach to the library. The 
most direct path from the 
Student Center Box Office -
where tickets to ~ ome ocial 
events are old - to the library 
is unlit and unmarked, 
winding through the depth of 
UC 0' eucalyptus groves. 

Adequate rest room facilitie 
are also lacking at the Central 
site. The nearest bathroom 
are located in the Third 
Lecture halls about a quarter-
mile away, and at a recent late-
night dance, the nearest open 
facilities were found at th 
Applied Physi and Mathe-
matics building, a half mile 
away. 

Although the dangers of the 
Central LIbrary patIO are 
obvious, not so clear are the 
rea ons why the Mandeville 
Center alcove wa removed 
from the Ii t of approved 
alcohol con umption ites. In 
the past, the alcove had been 
used for a number of 
successful student parties, 
including last year's Fogcut-
ter's drinking extravaganza. 

Last week, Cecil Lytle, 
chairman of the music 
department, was uccessful in 
per uading university officials 
to exclude the "pit" from the 
Ii t of social event locations. 

"Although the space i ideal 
for social function, Mande-
ville Center is literally a 
laboratory and it is con tantly 
u ed for tudent and faculty 
re earch," Lytle say. 

"Unfortunately, with the 
removal of the alcove from the 
list , our ability to ho t tudent 
events ha been weakened 
considerably and I don't ee 
any ea y and early alterna-
tive," ay Wat on. 

Lynn Petersen, director of 
the Univer ity Events Office, 
maintains that the new 
outdoor drinking policy would 
not pre ent a erious problem 
to the univer ity admini tra-
tion and tudent body if 
adequate facilitie de igned 
pecifically to hou e uch 

events were built. 
Watson has been attempting 

to e tablish a committee to 
begin planning capital 
development for undergradu-
ate affairs . The building of a 
facility to house student social 
events would be of prime 
concern to the committee. 

"There is a tentative plan by 
spring quarter to accommo-
date this (plan)," Watson ays. 

Despite the problems in 
these two pecitic cases, even 
other location remain 
approved for outdoor alcohol 
con umption . But the 
difficultie do not magically 
di, appear with th selectIOn of 
an approved ite. Alcohol 
abuse during th e sanctioned 
event till gives ample 
headache to tudent 
organizer ' and unive;:slty 
admini trator .

"It i hard to adequately

"During TGIF' , we make an 
effort to control the amount of

want an unlimited flow of

that," he add. 

Woodard explain that the 
beer is served early at a TGIF, 
with 11 to 14 keg con umed in 
about an hour and a half, 
"adequate time for individual 
to drink one or two erving of

new alcohol policy which 
state: "con umption of

"Our primary concern is to

New federalism 
Ronald Reagan gave his first State of the Union 

address the week before last. Rather than discuss the 
economic recession or the looming federal budget 
deficit , Reagan unveiled his grandiose plan for 
transferring control of many federal social welfare 
programs to the states. 

Reagan 's "New Federalism" is supposedly 
designed to take some of the pressure off the federal 
budget by eliminating the duplication of 
administration of these programs at both the state 
and federal level. 

The prospects of new federalism will have a 
profound effect on the budgets of all the states. This 
has officials of the University of California concerned 
that the strain on the state budget caused by the 
additional programs will adversely affect the UC 
budget allocation. 

New federalism is thus linked to students on the 
UC campuses. College students in the US have 
already suffered financially due to cuts in federal and 
state financial aid programs. In Reagan's fiscal 1983 
budget he has proposed additional cuts to the federal 
guaranteed student loan program. 

As a political constituency, students have not had 
any real effect on the decisions of the Reagan 
administration. That is why programs beneficial to 
students are being cut so indiscriminately. What 
Reagan obviously forgets is that the trained personnel 
needed to run Reagan's private defense sector comes 
from the universities . Abandoning college education 
as a national priority can only lead to a collapse of the 
industries that form the basis of any economic 
recovery. 

Students cannot ideally s it by and watch the 
erosion of university budgets and financial aid . They 
must make their voice felt.

Pacific News Service 

The failure of Reaganomics 
BY MARTIN BROWN 

Pacific News Service 
One yea r ago, Ronald 

Reagan entered the White 
House on a wave of political 
popularity that owed much of 
its strengt h to an innovative 
economic package - "conser-
vative" monetarism, plus 
"radical" supply-side theory. 
It came to be known as 
"Reaganomics." 

In his State of the Union 
adress Jan. 26, the president 
reasserted his own bel ief in 
many of the principles which 
define Reaganomics. But as 
budget director David 
Stockman suggested in his 
celebrated Atlantic magazine 
interview, the administra· 
tion's economic plan rests 
heavily on faith - and just 12 
months into the Reagan era, 
there is s trong evidence that 
the pres ident himself may be 
among the last of the faithful. 

In co n c lu s i v e way s, 
Reaganomics s imply hasn 't 
worked , and the people who 
must believe in it to make it 
work are rapidly falling back 
on more conventional theories 
which abandon the promise 
that carried the pres ident to 
Washington in. the first place: 

to return Americans to 
unlimited prosperity and 
unquestioned military power 
- but without recession or 
dou ble·digit inflation. 

The short-run success of 
Reagaonmics relied on the 
generation of optimistic 
expectations throughout the 
economy. To accomplish this 
goal, it coupled two policy 
ideas from its rival economic 
doctrines. 

From monetarism came the 
notion that healthy business 
investments req uire climate 
of financial stability. The best 
way to provide such a s table 
climate, monetarists argue, is 
"fiscal restraint" by the 
Federal Reserve. Monetarism 
predicted that both interest 
rates and inflation would fall 
with the decreas ing growth in 
the money supply. 

But what if business is 
skeptical of the resolve of the 
monetary authority to res train 
the money supply in the face of 
a possi bl e oil pr ice shock or at 
the firs t igns of an economic 
slowdow n? Then inves tors 
w o uld oper a te o n th e 
expect a tion of continued 
inflation , thereby reinforcing 
high interest rates, increas ing 

the cost of investment beyond 
expected returns and 
triggering a recession. 

This is where the supply· 
side fix came into Reagan· 
omics . Tax breaks, according 
to supply -siders , would 
alleviate any shortage of 
investment funds by increas-
ing personal savings. Invest-
ment incentives would reduce 
inflationary pressures by 
increasing investment and 
worker productivity , and 
therefore the supply of real 
goods and services in the 
economy would grow faster 
then the money supply. 

Faith in these effects, 
expressed by consumers and 
businessmen who understood 
and agreed with Reaganomics, 
would have guaranteed the 
desired climate of optimistic 
expectations. 

The likelihood of such broad 
agreement appeared to be 
validated on the eve of the 
inauguration , as Reagan took 
offi ce in the midst of a vibra nt 
rally by the New York Stock 
Exchange. The more tradi · 
tional Keynesian view, that 
bu s iness expectation s a re 
heav ily conditioned. instead ,

Costs and benefits of a college education 
Not all h igh school seniors 

regard thei r las t semester as a 
carefree picnic. Uncertainty 
a bout direction and success in 
the post-graduate years can 
s poil every thing. 

Squeezed between unem-
ployment and high college 
costs, tuden ts are probably 
more anxious than normal. 

At a recent gathering in 
Washington of high school 
s tudents from Louisiana, a 
s pectacled senior approached 
us for advice. 

Within a few weeks, he'd be 
enrolling in college. Under new 
rules for Social Security 
recipient s, pa ss ed b y 
Congress, he had to begin 
college early or lo s e 
educational benefits. 

Our acquaintance turned 
out to be one of at least 150,000 
American high school seniors 
who, the Social Security 
Administration says, must 
enroll in college by May 1 to 
s ustain their government 
benefits . Approximately 
700,000 children of disabled , 
deceased or retired parent 
received an average of $3,000 

in student assistance last year . 
By spring of ]985, under 
current law, these benefits 
will have dried up for those 
s till in the progrtam . 

Though the New Orleans 
native reli shed beating the 
congress ional cutoff date , he 
had little understanding of 
why he was going to college. 
He'd cons idered journalism, 
but was open to other fields of 
s tudy . 

Panic over student assis-
tance and high tuition has 
buried more important 
que tion about the purpose 
and value of an undergraduate 
education . While families are 
scurrying to find the ways and 
means to a college degree , even 
college professors are unsure 
it's worth the hassle. 

Only recently has the 
academiccommunitv decided 
to make a serious evaluation of 
the undergraduate degree. 
La t month, the Association of 
American Colleges established 
a 17·member commission of 
college professors and 
admini s trators to · tudy 
criticisms that baccalaureate 

pr ogram s had for s aken 
breadth for specialization. 

According to commissioner 
member Elizabeth Coleman, 
dean of New York 's New 
School for ocial Research, 
"More and more , economic and 
career concerns are at odd 
with the critical intellectual 
value s of undergraduate 
education .. .. You no longer 
have to be on the outskirts of 
education to raise pointed 
questions. " 

In forthcoming commission 
meetings, however , Coleman 
admits that one important 
ques tion may never come up: 
Must America' high schhools 
be radically restructured to 
assure that entering freshmen 
know why they've matricu-
lated to college? 

Of course, many American 
teenagers. including those 
who have gone through the 
trauma of a parent's death or 
disability are ready for a 
college eduation at 18. 

Yet, all too frequently, 
today's high school graduate 
becomes an undergraduate 

thanks s impl y to age. As a 
resul t, the firs t two years, if 
not t he entire c ollege 
experience , end up as a 
mishmash of kegs, standard-
ized course selection and 
faculty acquiescence. 

Mark H. Curti s , the 
association 's president who 
convened the baccalaureate 
degree s tudy, admits that 
"early college" programs such 
as Simon's Rock in Massachu· 
setts , can in ome cases better 
prepare American students for 
a s pecialized university 
experience. At Simon's Rock 
- part of New York's Bard 
College - s tudents can enroll 
for two or four years. 
beginning in what would be 
their junior year of high 
school. The over lapping 
arrangement help to 
tran s form direction le ss 
teenagers into degree·holders 
armed for the real world . 

It' s no secret that in four 
years , public high schools 
can ' t adequately prepare 
everyone for what lies ahead. 
Nor can competency require' 

ments do the trick when they 
don ' t reflect the highes t 
scholastic s tandards. 

Since colleges can 't afford to 
reduce an already declining 
a pplicant pool, PTA's and 
princ ipal s may have an 
obligat ion to di scourage the 
almost automatic "trickle·up" 
to college. Localized attempt 
to reform the traditional 
student' K-through-12 · 
through ·college chedule may 
be imperative. So might state 
board of education raise high 
school competency standards 
to levels that reflect an 
appreciation for what colleges 
once demanded. 

Serious change in the 
educational proces ' are never 
eas y. But, as Rep. Peter A. 
Payser (D-NY) senses from his 
own con tituency, college 
costs and declining . tudent aid 
are driving middle-income 
America into a panic. Perhaps 
the harsh s lap of financial 
reality can shake us into 
turning our high schools 'into 
effective college preparatory 
instit ut ions.

Reaganomics slips into a familiar rut 
,'on I illu ('d fnun pa~ .. -'- 2 
by the recent his tory of 
economic perform a nce and 
ca reful estimates of the long· 
r un structura l health of the 
eco nomy, we re forgotten 
momentaril y. Faith was a 
powerful ubstit ute. 

The reassuring Reagonomic 
scenario of renewed economic 
growth and lower inflation, 
however, overlooked the fact 
that the act ual links between 
s uppl y·s ide t ax c u ts. 
inves tment incentives and 
inc reased in ves tm ent a nd 
p ro du c tivity r e main e d 
theoretical. Nobod y reall y 
kn e w how work e r s and 
bus ine men would respond to 
such incentives. Even if each 
of these uncertain linkages 
held true. economic estimates 
would put the period bet ween 

impl e m e n tatio n of the 
program and it " full impact at 
anywhere from two to five 
years . 
. Mea n w hile, a tte mpts to 
preserve the monetari st s ide of 
the program would only make 
interes t rate wor. e in the 
s hort run. And in the wake of 
high interest rates, reduced 
g ove rnment revenu e and 
inc rea. ed un e mployme n t 
ins ur a nce payments, t h e 
federal deficit would explode. 
In thi s s itua t ion even the

With expected fut ure sales and 
profits low. savings would be 
channeled into uch specula-

corporate mergers rather than 
job· and product iv it y-boost ing 

investment. 
Aft er a year of Reaganomics 

this d istur bing recessionary 
scenario has become a reality, 
and in the process it has 
produced ideological fallout. 
Key Republica n po li ticians 
like Vermont Gov. Richard A. 
Snelling have warned the 
president th at his policies 
const it ute an "economic Bay 
of Pigs." 

M ur r ay W e id enbaum, 
chairman of the President's 
Counc il of Economic AdVIsers. 
is read y to aban don the long· 
cherished Republican goal of a 
balanced budget, the fulfi ll·

being sold th is." Le la nd 
P r u s i a , c h air ma n of 
BankAmerica Corporation a nd 

a noted spokesman for the 
bU;"lnes~ communIty, has 
complained ruefully. 

That President Reagan 
remains a true believer In 
Reaganomics, however. wa~ 
clear In his State of the Uniun

Letter to the Editor 

N ew library reserve policy clarified 
Editor: 

Your edi t orial "S pace 
Reserved," (UCSD Guardian , 
Feb. 1, 1982) concerning the 
Librar(s plan to phase out its 
"soft ' reserve s er vice , 
prompts me to respond with 
the following clarification and 
ampl i fication. 

1. "Soft" reserves - or non-
library reserves - do not 
constitute "most reserves" as 
you suggest : they account for 
less than 25 percent of total 
reserve holdings in all campus 

l ibra ri es. T wo libra r ies, 
Central and Scripps, do not 
handle t hem at all . 

2. Di stribu tion of "soft " 
reserve materials began as a 
convenience for facul ty and 
s tudents several years ago at a 
time when the Library had 
enough space and personnel to 
accommodate the service . 
More recently. the service has 
grown beyond an yo ne 's 
expectations - and beyond 
our space and s taffing 
capabilities. 

3. T he Librarv has never 
dou bted the value of non· 
Iibrarf reserve materials for 
st uden ts . B ec a use we 
acknowledge t heir value, we 
have worked for two years on 
the problem, t rying to find 
alternatives to the Library's 
handling them. 

4 . Yo u s ugges t t hat 
academic departments are not 
able to take on the service. 
Actually , several departments 
served by the Science and 
Engineering Library have 
already arranged to distribute 

thei r problem sets, lect ure 
notes, etc .. to tudents: this 
ha apparently cau. ed no one

Chase 
Editor: 

( was distressed to see that 
The Guardian did not carry 
any news or mention of the 
death of one of our visiting 
professors, Harold Chase. I 
called The Guardian to notify 
them within 24 hours, but 
never had a follow up or story 
on this : both San Diego 
newspapers had articles on 
Professor Chase's deat h, not 
only because he was a faculty 
member at UCS D, but also a 
prominent figure in thi s 
country. 

Because we in the Political 
Sc ien ce Department felt 
strongly about the loss of 
Professor Chase and heard 
from so many students that 
they felt the same way, I 
wanted the following excerpt 
from a letter written by hi 
widow, Bernice Chase, to be 
printed : 

"I want you to know how 
very happy Hal was the last . 
days of his life to be teaching at 
the University. He ex pres ed 
so often how great the faculty , 
staff and students were. He 
seemed to feel that this 
particular class of student 
had much to offer and will 
probably go on to make a great 
contribution to this country."

CEP announces revised 
policy on cheating 

Central library received several new air conditioning units 
early Sunday morning. Due to their bulk, the units were air lift. 
ed into place using a special s ling rig mounted on a helicopter. 

By MELINDA WENKER 
The Committee on Educa· 

tional Policy (CEP) recently 
announced a new policy for 
dealing with academic 
dishonesty. 

Under the new proposal, a 
special committee would be 
formed to hear each case of 
suspected dishonesty. These 
committees - composed of 
three faculty members and 
two students - would jud~e 
each ca'Se of academiC 
dishonesty on the basis of 
evidence submitted by both 
the accused student and the 
instructor. 

Two separate penalties 
would be imposed if the 
committee finds the student 
guilty of the charge: failure in 
the course (which was was the 
standard academic penalty in 
the past), and academic 

'Orallllajority' director 
speaks on caDlpus 

By GLYNIS COSTIN 
"You 've all been brain· 

washed to think you're a 
minority .. jn all cities it's the 
same: anti·sex, anti·love, anti· 
human rights." 

These are the words of Bob 
Kunst, executive director of 
"The Oral Majority," a group 
which was originally formed 
in Florida in reaction to Anita 
Bryant 's anti·tf<ly campaign, 
and has continued to rally 
actively against Jerry Falwell 
and the Moral Majority. 

Kuns t , who spoke on 
campus las t Friday before a 
crowd of twen ty, feels that a 
major impediment to sexual 
freedom in this country is that 
the "real majority" has been 
"brainwashed into thinking 
they're a minority," mainly 
because they don't receive the 
same kind of publicity nor 

have the same visibility that 
the Moral Majority has. He 
added that, I actually most 
people want to be left alone, 
and could care less about who 
sleeps with who." 

Kunst spoke out in favor of 
sexual freedom, including gay 
rights , abortion, freedom of 
speech and prosti tution. He 
expressed concern over the 
apparent apathy or unaware· 
ness of those he feels to be a 
part of the Oral Majority. He 
asserted that "the people are 
not a 'moral ' majority but an 
oral majority .... They are 
sexual beings who want 
freedom but the Moral 
Majority are the people in key 
positions , such as government 
and media. " 

Kunst went on to proclaim, 
however, that "all is not lost" 
and that the Oral Majority has 

already achieved a few 
victories, includin~ the defeat 
of Anita Bryant s anti·gay 
campaign in Florida , t he 
passage of a constitutional 
amendment for individual 
privacy, the defeat of the 
teaching of creationism in 
pu blic schools in Arkansas, 
and the overturning of a book 
banning decision in Maine. 

Although Kunst made it 
quite clear that he has specific 
interests as a gay , he made an 
effort to point out that the 
"Oral Majority is striving for 
much more than merely gay 
rights." Kunst added that 
"human sexuality is not a 
liberal vs. conservative issue, 
but an individualistic one." 

The crowd ~eemed to be, for 
the most part, supportive of 
Kunst's views:

probation and the establish· 
ment of a diSCiplinary record 
in the office of the appropriate 
dean. 

There have been some 
objections to the proposed 
policy among college deans. 
Chip Dreilenger, Dean of MUIr 
College, felt the single biggest 
worry is that "the new policy 
leaves it' possible that 
everyone on the committee 
could come from the same 
department. It is conceivable 
that the students might feel a 
need to agree with the 
professor (if they planned to 
remain in his department. )" 

Lee Anderson, the under· 
graduate representative to the 
CEP, said that "the CEP is 
concerned about the composi· 
tion of the committee that 
would be formed if the dean 
and the student and the 
professor could not resolve the 
cheating issue." According to 
Anderson, the problem here is 
the deciSIOn to choose the three 
professors and two students 
from either within or from 
outside of the department. 

"The CEP chose to leave the 
decision open·ended. (The 
committee can be formed from 
people within the department 
as well as from outside the 
department. ) By leaving the 
policy so open, the department 
chairman will appoint 
whoever is available ," 

Anderson said, 
Dreilenger also aid that 

"(the formation of) a brand 
new ad hoc committee (for 
each new case) means there IS 
no real experience which 
means that If the committee is 
unfamiliar with due process 
they cou ld step on the nghts of 
the student." 

This problem could be 
resolved if there were a 
standing committee formed 
that would be familiar with 
the proper procedural steps. 
Anderson, however, felt that 
there are "not too many cases 
on campus to merit a standing 
committee." 

Moreover, Dreilenger said 
that the deans "object to the 
overall tone of the policy" He 
feels that it seems to be 
written from the Viewpoint of 
the student being guilty until 
proven Innocent. 

Policy Tabled 
John Alksne, chamnan of 

the Academic Senate, tabled 
the new proposal after hearing 
the objections presented by the 
Executive Policy Committee. 

The Jroposal will be 
discuss duri~ the EPC 
meeting of the first week in 
March, with the deans and the 
chairman of the CEP, Carl 
Helstrom, also present. 

Unless the policy is retabled, 
it will go to the next Academic 
Senate meeting for approval. 

Bus route changed 
The San Diego Transit is 

offering new express bus 
service into Mira Mesa and 
Scripps Industrial Park 
beginning thiS month , 
announced San Diego city 
councilman Ed Struiksma. 

The new ervice is an 
extension of the existing Route 
30, Struiksma said . By 
extending the express route, 
bus riders can travel between 
downtown San Diego and 

Scripps Industnal Park, with 
stops at La Jolla, UCSD, La 
10lla Village Square, Scripps 
Hospital , the Veterans' 
Administration Hospital, 
University Towne Centre, and 
Mira Mesa. 

The new ervice will run 
hourly Monday t hrough 
Friday and will make 
connections with San Diego

An ultra ·conservative 
political committee has asked 
the state attorney general and 
the Alameda County District 
Attorney's office to investigate 
their claim that international 
terrorism - including the 
recent kidnapping of Brig. 
Gen . James Dozier in Italy -
can be linked to "radical 
networks" centered at UC 
Berkeley. 

The National Democratic 
Policy Committee (NDPC), the 
group which ponsored 
Lyndon LaRou che's 1980 
presidential bid, presented the 
attorney general's office with 
50 pages of document· which 
purportedly link several 
cholar with terrorism. 
The docum e nt · are 

forwarded with the claim that 
"since the late 1950' , the 
branch of the social cience 
known alternatively as 
• criminology' and 'interna· 
tional law' and 'deviant 
studies' has been a thinly 
veiled cover for the training, 
recruiting and deploying of 
international terrorist 
organizations of both the red 
(com muni t) and black (neo· 
fasci t) varieties." 

UC Berkeley operated a 
crimi nology school untIl 1976. 
Budgetary problems datIng 
back to 1959 were cited for the 
chool's demise. 
The NDPC, however, claim 

the school was closed a the 
result of investigations by the 
California tate Police and the 
attorney general's office 

which led to the "outcry 
again st the pro·terrorist 
activities emanating from the 
Criminology School." 

A s pokesman for the 
attorney general said no record 
of such an investigation could 
immediately be found 

Khushro Ghandhi. west 
coast coordinator for the 
NDPC's fact finding division, 
told reporters last week he 
could not link specific acts of 
terrorism to professors or 
tudent. at any UC campus. 

But a new invetigation, he 
said, could Implicate current 
univer ity employee. to arson, 
bombing, theft, and narcotic 
trafficking. 

The NDPC report charges 
that GiovannI Senzani, a 
purported Red Brigade 
terrorist whom Italian police 
have linked to the Dozier 
kidnapping, IS being investi· 
gated for po SIble membership 
in terrorist networks 
a sociated with the Berkeley 
ociology and criminology 

departments. 
These networks , the report 

conti nue , "overlap the 
ci rcles" of local left,wlng 
activists. 

A UC Santa Barbara 
profe or targeted In (he 
report as the leader of one 
circle said yesterday the 
charges are "pure falsehood ... 
I ha\'e nothing to do with 
Berkeley and a far as I'm 
concerned tho e net works 
they're talking about are 
figment of someone's 
imaginatIOn. "

Diver's eye view of the sea slug 
BY BERT N. KOBAYASHI 

Many of us are familiar with snails 
that have a hell - the ordinary 
garden snail, moon snails. the black 
Turban snails, tiny and abundant 
periwinkles high in the intert idal zone. 
the pretty tropical black or pink 
Murex. wavy-top shell, and the varied 
forms of the deadly cone shells. Many 
of us have also seen, either while tide-
pooling or while viewing underwater 
pictures. those animals called sea 
slugs and /or nudibranchs (pronounced 
nude-ee- brank s). These latter 
mollusks. or soft-bodied animals, are 
essentiall y snail s that through 
evolution have either greatly reduced 
the size of the shell or eliminated the 
shell entirely in the adult stage of the 
life cycle. 

Although the nudibranchs are most 
spectacular in their vivid colors. there 
are a couple of other snails that are 
nearly s hell -less and which are 
common and visible to the tidepooler. 
One is the California sea hare. Aplysia 
cali/arnica, which is often placed In the 
genus Tethys. It is a large sea lug. 
often reaching lengths of nearly 20 
inches; the body is brown, or mottled 
brown. or sometimes almost jet black. 
It discharges a jlurplish ink when 
disturbed . The sea hare is without an 
external shell , but it does have a thin. 
internal remnant of a shell. The 
possession of long. ear-like tentacles. 
which are used to detect odors and 
chemicals in the water, gives the 
common name to this s luggish . 
common mollusk . 

The other sea slug com moly seen by 
many of us sea lovers is the so·called 
stiped sea slug. Navanax inermis. This 
soft animal is brown, with paler brown 
bars and bright yellow and iridescent 
blue spots along the sides of the body. 
It grows up to 12 inches long and is 
considerably sleeker and less bloated 
in appearance than the sea hare_ 
Unlike the sea hare. Navanax is found 
in quieter waters of the tidepools and 
especially abundant in the eel-grass 
covered mudflats of shallow bays and 
channels. The interesting feature of 
this slug i that it is carnivorous and. 
in fact. cannibalistic on other sea 

slugs! Preliminary work done at 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography 
indicates that each Navanax 
individ ual secretes a su bstance and 
deposits it along its trail on the sand or 
mud; this chemical substance repels 
other Navanax individuals. The 
evolut ionary ignificance of this 
repellant is not clearly worked out yet, 
but undoubtedly. this permits the 
effective utilization of prey within a 
given area without the competition 
afforded by having another hunter in 
the same area. 

Most marine photographers, and 
e pecially the underwater types. in 
southern California focus on the slow-
moving, often graceful and elegant. 
distinctively-colored nudibranchs as 
subjects for a slide series. The e are 
truly snails without shell ,although a 
small. coiled hell i always present in 
the embryo. They do not have true 
gills. and respiration is carried out 
either through the body surface 
directl y or through gill-like tructure • 
called cerata or branchiae, which lie 
expo ed on the back of the animal, give 
the animal the general name of 
nudibranch , meaning "naked gills." 

Thee are two general groups of 
nudibranch : the aeolid group and the 
dorid gr oup. These can be 
differentiated by the pattern of 
distribution of the cerata. The aeolid 
ones have these "gills" scattered as a 
fringe along the sides of the animal. or 
scattered in several groups along the 
back. or spread evenly throughout the 
back. The dorid type has these 
structures gathered together in a tree· 
like cluster on-the posterior or rear 
part of the back. There are di tinctive 
family groupings within each type of 
nudibranch , but for our purpose of 
identification, the categories of aeolid 
or dorid type shou ld suffice. 

Nudibranchs are most often found in 
the quiet waters of tidepools, or at 
deeper subtidal depths. A favorite 
observation trick for the hardy 
nudibranch-cha er is that of getting up 
at 4 a.m. and hitting the tidepools at a 
minu tide bright and early before 
dawn. especially In the spring months. 
Of course, the less energetic SCUBA 

diver types have taken the ea y way 
out and get upat lOa.m .. togoonadive 
to Scripps Canyon in the middle of the 
day. and find these gorgeous creatures 
in abundance along the vertical walls 
of that underwater canyon. 

These often brightly colored animals 
are found creeping along the various 
attached algal plants on the bottom, 
feeding on the hydroids (anemone-like 
cratures) attached to the blade of the 
plants. or on sponges encrusting the 
rocky slopes. Occasionally, one see a 
nudibranch in the water column , 
swimming by violent convulSive and 
jerking motion; this i most 
commonly observed with the 
abundant purple and orange 
nudibranch. Flabellinopsis iodinea, or 
more commonly called the Spanish 
Shawl. 

All nudibranchs are apparently 
carnivorous, mostly feeding on the 
hydroids and sponges. Thus. in 
collection made for hi SCientific 
categorizations of nudtbranch at 
Scripps. James Lance take pecial 
care to collect the hydroid or sponges 
in the immediate area that the 
nudibranch was found. Jim i an 
acknowledged world-authority on 
nudibranchs. especially with the 
California forms. He has an extensive 
slide collection of over 105 species, and 
he can answer virtually any question 
one might pose on these interesting 
animals. He can be contacted at 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography; 
undoubtedly, he will invite you along 
on one of his insane pre-dawn trips to 
the local tidepools. 

The aeolid nudibranchs have been 
detected with the stinging cells (called 
nematocysts) of the hydroids u ed as 
food stored inactivated in the tips of 
the cerata. It is obvious that the 
feeding of these nudibranch somehow 
keeps the stinging cells of the hydroids 
from discharging and the e cells pass 
through the digestive system and 
migrate out to the ends of the gill-like 
extensions along the back of the 
animal. These stinging cells then form 
a protectie mechanism for the 
n u d i branch. Experiments have 
demonstrated that these stinging cells 

are derived from the hydroid food as 
they are pre ent when these hydroids 
are part of the diet and ab ent when 
the hydroids are withheld from the 
diet. What a marvelou evolutionary 
maneuver to provide protectIOn for 
these otherwise defenseless soft-
bodied creat ures! 

The consptcuous colors of many of 
the species actually allow the animals 
to harmonize well wtth the colorful 
background of . ea animal ea 
anemone , hydroids, sea fans, ponges 
- and the colorful marine green. 
brown, and red algae . Further. 
although work in this a peCI I not 
definitive, it is thought that many of 
the pecies of nudibranch are 
dIstasteful or exude an offenSIve odor 
which provides the defense again . t 
being eaten by fishes and other 
predators. 

Along thiS line . there is an old 
pu blished record of a Professor 
Herdman who expertmented WIth 
vartou specie and found that everal 
of the larger pecles were left alone by 
fi hes. He thu decIded to test their 
palatability and ate a live pecimen of a 
conspicuous specie , A ncula cristata; 
he reported that .... . the ta te wa 
pleasant, di tinctly like that of an 
oyster ... " Interview with hundred of 
divers and as orted other eafood and 
sea hore lovers offer no other opinion 
- no one else seems to have tasted a 
nudibranch! 

Lest you fear that this article is 
going to end without identifying ome 
of the more common and conspicuous 
nudibranchs other than those already 
discussed, be assured that your fear 
has proven to be real. The verbal and 
written descriptions of these colorful 
and camera-ready models of ea life 
cannot do justice to the living animals; 
rather, should you need to get a 
particular specie identified. your be t 
bet i tocontactJim Lance at Scripps or 
find a color plate of the particular 
animal in Behren's 19 0 paperback 
called Pacl/ic Coast Nudibranchs . Of 
course. you can alway fall back on the 
least desirable method of contacting 
me.

How many corporations would be willing to pay 
you over $800 a month during your junior and 
senior years just so you'd join the company after 
graduation? Under a special Navy program 
we're doing just that. It's called the Nuclear 
Propulsion Officer Candidate·College Program. 
And under it, you'll not only get great pay during 
your junior and senior years, but after 
graduation you'll receive a year of valuable grad-
uate-level training that is not available from 
any other employer. 

If you are a junior or senior majoring in 
math, engineering or physical sciences, find out 
more today. And let your career payoff while 
still in college.

Notes an technical 'II' ,-----------1 t tteracy I Public ~~,:~:careen 
By RANDY U IIIYAMA 
There was a time, not , 0 

very far in the past. when a 
"functional illiterate" was a 
per on who could neither read 
nor write in a u eful capacit y. 
In that time. men could onl y 
peculate on the nature of 

sp aceflight. and digital 

Science. 
commentary 
computing involved nothing 
more than counting with one', 
finger. Today. as our 
scie ntifi c a nd te chni ca l 
knowledge increases exponen-
tia lly. society is faced with a 
new form of illiteracy; the 
phenomenon of the "technical· 
Iy illiterate." 

"Technical illiteracy" may 
be defined as a lack oj 
understanding of scientific or 
technical matters. This lack of 
und rstanding has broad 

~ocial and economic implica-
tions. 

This situa t ion can be 
illustrated bv the examination 
of an issue" such as nuclear 
power. Hardly a week passes 
without so me activitv 
concerning the safet y of its 
use. One would expect that a 
reasonable debate might be 
po sible concerning this is ue. 
In practice. however. this i 
u ually not the case. U ually. a 
mall . cientific and technical 

elite seem to have the greatest 
weight in determining the 
desirability of development of 
nuclear power. 

La y persons mu st rely 
primari ly on the advice of the 
forementioned "experts" or on 
si mplistic or imaginative 
pseudo cientific rationales. 

For example. imagine a 
prote t at B.Y.T (Blow Your 
Top) uclear Plant Nine. If 
one were allowed to poll the 
engineers a to the safety of 
the design. it is mo t likely 
that one wou ld receive a 
vi rtually impo sible equation 
reql.iiring 10 years to solve via 
pi'ogrammable calculator. 
Conversely. if one were to poll 
tne protesters. half would 
answer to the nuclear question 
with no more a convincing 
argument than. "radioactivity 
is bad for people" or "isn't 
radiation some sort of poi on 
that kill people?" 

Thi lack of understanding 
is a two- ided is ue. Ignorance 
by the public could be viewed 
a. a favorable condition in 

those ca'e where it would 
see m that on ly ce rtain 
specialists would be qualified 
to assess a given problem. On 
the other hand . keeping the 
public in the dark about some 
or all aspects of the workings 
of a scientific or technical 
project could be a danger as 
well. The public often views 
such endeavors as some kind 
of sc ientific magic. For 
exam ple , the recent popularity 
of "monoclonal" technology 
stock on the stock exchanges 
is probably due less to the 
knowledge of the technology 
than {)utright speculation . 

For a long time the nuclear 
industry was the great 
promise of the future and the 
public upported the idea 
who leheartedly. Unfortu· 
nately, a concerted campaign 
to "cover up" potential fault 
in nuclear ystems and the 
disaster at Three Mile Island 
have altered the public \-iew 
and strong di. tru st of nuclear 
tech nology now exi~t . in many 
areas. New technologies in 
recombinant DNA and in the 
physical sciences could be 
faced with ' imilar prublem if 
proper and judiciou measure 
are not taken. 

The inabtlity to judge i sues 
is only one facet of the 
"technical illiteracy" problem. 
Even more obviou is the 
potential to alter the economic 
tate of the nation . Those who 

under t and the technologies 
will profit by the knowledge; 
those who do not may very 
well com pri se a new 
permanent undercla s. If 
robot technology becomes 
prevalent. will the blue collar 
worker become part of thi 
class? 

In a en e. theworkingclass 
is a successful group that must 
eit her adjust to tne new order 
or cea e to be a major economic 
force. The greatest st rength 
and weakness of this group is 
the strong union structure. 
The fa te of the bl ue collar class 
depends on whet her or not the 
unions can convince the 
membership of the urgency of . 
retraining and education in a 
new technological age. 

What are the causes of the 
new "illiteracy?" Perhaps it is 
the strange sense of value that 
pervades our society. The 
names of designers inscribed 
upon the buttock portion of 
mens' and ladies' apparel seem 
to warrant more consideration 
than the thoughts and ideas of 
men and women. Academic

University fears effects of neW" federalism 
BY HENRY SCHULMAN 

Sacramento CorTe.pondent 
SACRAMENTO - Univer· 

sity officials expressed 
concern yesterday that 
President Reagan's economic 
and federalism programs will 
hurt the UC, especially 
financial aid and research. 

A representative of the 
state's finance department 
said Monday his office has not 
yet studied Reagan's plans, 
which include further budget 
reductions and the transfer of 
several federal programs to the 
state. 

Bu t Dr. Lowell Paige, the 
university 's Sacramento 
lobbyist , contended Reagan's 
programs will hurt the UC 
because the state's revenues 
will be needed to fund new 
welfare, transportation and 

other responsibilities shifted 
to the state. 

"The impact of federalism 
will obviously adds stress to 
the state's bu~et. which will 
put stress on the university 's 
budget," said Paige. 

UC President David Saxon 
was in Washington last week 
by invitation of the House 
Science and Tec hnology 
Committee. He testified that 
he was encouraged by 
adminis tration statements of 
su pport for research, bu t 
feared it would be cut in the 
fervor of reducing the federal 
budget. 

Also in Washington, t he 
American Council of Educat· 
ion held a press conference 
yesterday warning that cut in 
university research wou ld 
s low the nation's economic 
growth, si nce half the 

country's research i s 
conducted at college campu· 
ses. 

Still pending, however, are 
proposals by Gov. Brown to 
grant the university more 
than $4 million for high· 
technology research this year: 

In his proposed budget, 
Reagan will also suggest cuts 
in financial aid - reducing 
some programs, eliminating 
others. 

Acco rding to figure s 
released by the education 
counci l, t he number of PELL 
grant recipients (basic st udent 
loans) would be reduced by 
nearly 50 percent in 
California. Funding for that 
program would be reduced 
(rom $160 million to $96 
million . 

National Direct Student 
Loans and College Work Study 

would al so be reduced by $80 
million in California . Reagan 
plans to gradually eliminate 
several loan programs , 
including Guaranteed Student 
Loans for graduate students, 
Supplemental E conomic 
Opportunity Grants for low· 
income st udents, State 
Student Incentive Grants and 
Health Profess ion Student 
Loans. 

" We 're saying that if 
President Reagan cuts hal f the 
student aid programs by 1983· 
84, for several hundred 
t hou san d people coll ege 
education will be beyond their 
reach," warned Bob Aaron of 
the education council. 

Reagan will introduce his 
budget proposal Monday . 
David Wil so n, Saxon s 
executive assistant, said his 
staff will immediately begin to 

evaluate the plan and they 
hope to prepare a preliminary 
report on it for this month 's 
Board of Regents meeting. 

Wilson said the university is 
still assessing this year's 
budget , because some funds 
scheduled for research have 
been stalled by the inability of 
the president and Congress to 
agree on appropriation bills. 

Near the beginning of 
March, t he state Legislature 
will begin considering Gov. 
Brown's proposed 1982·83 
state budget, which ca ll s for a 
2.5 percent cu t in t he 
univesity's spending. 

State funds account for 
about 25 percent of the 
university's revenues. Other 
money comes from the US 
government, student fees, 
gifts and other funds.

S.F. Literary Renaissance conference at UCSD 
BY SCOTT YOUNG 

The jxJem/ Is seen from all sides/Everywhere/ 
At once. 

-Gary Snyder 

San Francisco in the fift ies and sixties could 
have been called the Magic City. A movement 
began there, now called the Youth Movement, 
which spread its message of peace, love and 
freedom across the country. It was a counter-
culture of drugs and protest, a riot of love and 
Hell 's Angels gut· level brotherhood. 

From the center of this foggy city arose a new 
literature, marked by a spontaneous, image-
jammed poetry of honesty and interaction with 
the world. It was the San Francisco Literary 
RenaJssance , a poetic upheaval which 
drastically altered 
and enthusistically 

all members of the Bay Area community, and 
also represent the diversity of direct ions that 
poetry has taken since the magnificent word 
explosion of the fifties and sixties. They are, 
briefly: 
Robert Duncan, an actively political poet, 
with a challenging, energetic and openly 
romantic poetic view. He was very much a part 
of the anti·war movement of the sixties, and 
has published many books, among them The 
Opening of the Field, and Bending the Bow. 
Gary Snyder, a friend of Lew Welch at Reed 
College, and one of the most famous American 
poets. His books, such as Myths and Texts. 
Turtle Isumd, and Rivers and Mountains 
Without End refltct a deep commitment to the 

power of the land 

affirmed the course 
of modern AmeriCan 
literature. Conference Schedule 

and to the endurin/!t 
force of the primI-
tive imagination. 
William Everson, 
a Conscientious 
Objector during 
WWII, was one of 
the founders of the 
San Francisco art-
istic commmunity. 
For several years he 
was a lay brother in 
the Dominican

The UCSD Guardian 

Performance artist Julia Heyward will be here Wednesday 

'Cinematic rock and roll' 
Julia Heyward will be presenting two live performances of her 

new video-disc album, T Venus, to San Diego audiences on 
Wednesday. This will be her first performance in the area. The 
presentation is a part of the yearly "What's Cooking?" series 
s ponsored by the Center for Music Experiment at UCSD. 

"Cinematic Rock and Roll" is how Heyward describes her 
work. The lyrics are cut in the same way film cuts from image to 
image, addi ng dimension and creating a lyrical stream of 
con.sciousness. The performance is blended with film projections 
to reveal a personal point-of-view. The mu ic and the film 
become inseparable, creating a complete experience. 

Julia Heyward has performed throughout the US, including 
the Whitney Museum in New YorkCity, the Chicago Museum of 
Contemporary Art , and the California Institute of the Arts. In 
Europe, she has performed in France, Austria , Germany, Italy, 
Denmark, and Holland. She is a pioneer in performance art and 
has produced the first video-disc album, for that medium. 

Both performances will be on Wednesday at 8 p.m. and again 
at 10 p. m. Ticket prices are $4.50 for the general pu blic and $3.50 
for UCSD students. Tickets are available at the door prior to 
performance, or reservations may be made in advance by 
telephoning the Center for Music Experiment at 452-4383.

First rugby win 
is 'scrum'ptious 

By TINA CALLAHAN 
The UCSD Rugby team ended their match on Saturday 

bruised and bumped, but not beaten. The Tritons earned their 
first official win of the sea on with a 12-6 victory over Cal Poly 
Pomona, bringing their league record to I-I after last week's 

. defeat by USD. 
T he first , core of tht! game wa ' made by Dan Walters on a 

penalty kick, to put UCSD out in front by three points. The team 
continued to maintain field position, crucial in the game of 
rugby, by dominating the serums and line·outs. 

Scrums resemble organized pile ups as players lock arms 
about each others' shoulders and attempt to pass ~he ball to a 
teammate with their feet. Line·outs, like sc rums, are used to 
determine possession after a penalty or out-of-bounds play. 

Similar to a basketball jump-ball and a soccer throw-in, a line-
out features two rows of opposing athletes facing each other 
across a narrow "no man's land ." As the ball is tossed into this 
corridor the lines crash together. Designatedjumpers attempt to 
bat the ball to the scrum half while power forwards jockey for 
position. 

At the start of the second half, Cal Poly threatened to close 
with a long run which ended near UCSD's goal line, but an 
infraction was called before they were able to score. 

This drive however, cost UCSD Chris Wilson, their serum 
half, a player who can make or break t~e.game. ~ilso~ sat out 
the remainder of the match due to a relllJury of hIS thIgh. 

Tritons r eady to dominate league 
Toward the middle of the second half, the increased numberof 

infractions resulted in a lot of scrums and line'outs, making it 
seem for a while as though it could be anyone's game. But the 
Tritons oon had it back in their control. 

The first try , rugby' equivalent to a touchdown, was scored 
by Lenny Mygatt, and ~noth.er kick by Walters converted ~hetry 
to bring their lead up SIX POllltS to 9-0. Cal Poly was at thIS tIme 
playing only 14 men against our 15 due to an injury that had 
come after they had already used their two allotted 
substitutions. 

Soon after, Walters came through with another penalty kick to 
raise the lead to 12-0, and bring hi s total game points to B. 

Poly surprised UCSD by pulling together in the las t few 
minutes to have Ricky Galera cross the goal line and touch for a 
try, followed by a conversion by CharlieRossman. "That try was 
just a let up," commented Jon Sch leimer, UC D'. team captai n, 
on t hat last scoring of the match . 

This year's team is described by assistant coach Peter Sertic 
a~ being a "team in transition." due to the loss of some key 
players who have grarluated SInce last season. 

One of t he most unique t hmgs about a rugby match is that the 
player. leave the field friends, The tension and brutality .of the 
game IS \\ ashed away at the [lost -match party. whIch .IS 
traditionally hosted by the home team. The sport and Its 
S IJOrtsmanshi p were bt'SL descri bed by head coach Russell 
Skerett's wife. Lucy, when she said . "Rugby is a thug's game 
played bv gent lemen. " 

Next Saturday, February 13. the team will be playing again on 
Muir Field against Claremont. The match is scheduled to begin 
at I p.m.

Women's softball at UC San

two winning seasons running

After the one contest. the

The team went virtually

it went 14,7 and placed first in

Surf teatn future looks glassy 
BY PETE NEWMAN 

The Triton Surf Team held its first contest 
of the eason at Black's Beach Saturday 
morning. Even though their previously 
scheduled competitors, USD and 
PalomarlMiracosta colleges, had cancelled out 
due to prior commitments, coach Mike Shand 
and his team still took part in a practice meet in 
order to determine who will sllrf again t Point 
Lorna and Cal State Long Beach February 20. 
This intra-club competition showed off the top 
talent and depth that Coach Shand hopes will 
enable the team to better last vear's 9·1 record. 

Under patchy gray skies, the conte t got 
underway at 7:30 a.m. in readily surfable, but 
not spectacular, 2·3 foot waves. For four hours, 
around two dozen su rfers fought it out in 
eleven elimination heats, narrowing the field 
down to five riders for the final. By this time, 
the sun had started to peek through the clouds, 
and some of the intermittent set waves were 
reaching- a fairly well·formed four feet. 

When the closely·matched final was over, 
team captain Dave Atkin had taken first place 
in the men's division, due in part to his superior 

I wave selection. He was followed by Mark 
Adams in second, Ron Carl in third. and Mike 
Majek and Jay Broad in fourth and fifth 

Ix>sitions, respectively. Craig Schiebr was also 
eligible to surf in the final, but he chose not to. 
Two of the hottest urfers on the team, Steve 
Colton and Mark Brolaski, had other 
responsibilities which kept them out of the 
water for orne or all of the contest. 

In the women's division , Joyce Si sons took 
top honors, with Isabel Fried earning second 
place. There was no separate division for 
knee boarders contested Sat urday, but the 
Triton team boastsoneofthebest kneerider in 
the state, Bill Lerner. 

Coach Shand was definitely pleased with the 
morning's outcome, irregardless of the lack of 
outside competition. He was pleasantly 
surprised to find an unexpected depth of talent. 
The team has at least twenty good, solid 
surfers, while only twelve men from anyone 
school can take part in an intercollegiate meet. 

Shand looks forward to an undefeated 
season, citing last year's almost-perfect 9-1 
record, and the talent of some of the new riders 
on the team. "Oran~e Coast College just barely 
beat u last year,' Shand remarked, "and I 
know that we can take them this eason." 

With an ample supply of talent , plenty of 
:.:onfidence and enthusiasm, and the proper 
winnmg attitude, the Triton urfer should be 
the top squad on the coast.

defeated by Cal State Long continued their domination of enroute to a 85-53 victory. 

Softball set to defend title 
conI inued fmm page 17 
Fullerton, USC and UC Santa 
Barbara. This is quite a 
change from recent years 
when the Tritons were 
everyone's whipping post. 

"We had the kind of team 
coache would count on for a 
win before they even played 
us," Monteverde says. "You 
know, the coaches would mark 
a 'W' next to us on the 
schedule before the game." 

The winning season came in 
the coach's freshman year and 
on the heels of back·to-back 2· 
27 seasons. 

He credits last year's 
dramatic turnaround to "a 
group of individuals on the 
team who really wanted to 
listen and to learn to play very 
competitive softball. ' 

Returning this year is Rita 
Uribe. the hard -t hrowin~ 

pitcher who won 13 of the 
team 's] 4 victories. including a 
no· hitter and three one· 
hitters. Uribe ays she is 
confident she is pitching as 
well as she did last year and 
hope to add speed and motion 
to her delivery. Monteverde 
will pitch her in 99 percent of 
the games and use her at first 
or in the outfield otherwise. 

"It's not unusual to see a 
softball pitcher throw in two 
or three game in a row," 
Monteverde explains. "The 
underarm throw is a more 
natural motion and uses 
gravity to help the throw 
along. The overhand (baseball) 
throw actually goes against 
the natural motion of the arm 
and puts the whole body into 
the pitch." 

Davis will again take up 
duties behind the plate. She 

attended USC on a track 
scholarship before coming last 
year to UC San Diego. She can 
hit with authority and has a 
good arm. 

Bonnie Betz, last year's 
third baseman. will take over 
at short stop. Betz says she 's 
played infield in the 12 year · 
she's played softball. And, 
while a con istent hitter, her 
fielding will amaze you. 

Leading off the order will be 
outfielder Kathy Clasby who 
batted a sizzling. 714 last year 
in the play-ofts. She'll share 
the outfield with another good 
arm, Dawn Polk. 

With all this talent , UC San 
Diego looks in fine form to 
finish strong this year if not 
take the championship as 
team consensus indicates. The 
only low point may return in 
the lack of interest and 
support. 

Team pins hopes on star pitcher 
:ontinucd from page 17 
pull one to their power alley . 

Uribe came to UC San Diego 
last year after leaving a 
private scholarship at USIU 
because she says, "They put 
all their money into sports. I 
v..:ante.d tOJIet into an academic 
situatIOn. 

She showed up late in 
tryouts last year and, once 
given a tryout by coach Dan 
Monteverde, she amazed 
everyone. 

"We'd been praying for 
someone like Rita to show up," 

I Davis laughs. 

I From there, Uribe proceeded to win 13 of the team's 14 
I victories, pitch a no-hitter and 
I three one-hitters and lead the 

club in homeruns. UC San 
Diego went on to place first in 
California Collegiate Confer-
ence play and third in Santa 
Barbara WAIAW (Western 
Athletic Intercollegiate 
Association for Women) final s. 

'Tm convi nced Rita would 
have made AII·American if 
we'd have gone to the 
nat ionals," Monteverde says. 

A love of sports seems to 
have been inborn for Uribe 
who says her father was the 
only coach she'd ever had. He 
excelled at a number of sports 
and coached her through high 
school where she played five 
ports. 
Preseason workouts is a 

time she ay is being used to 
perfect her delivery and build 

her speed, her father is 
showing her new grips to add 
motion to an already 
devastating throw. 

"Before I came to UCSD, I 
hadn't thrown in a year and a 
half," she says. "Right now 
I'm as fast as I was the end of 
last year and getting faster. 
Later I'll add some movement 
to my pitches." 

And while hitting Uribe 
even now takes some doing, 
Davis says catching her IS 
pretty easy. 

"The ball is coming in faster 
and straighter. You don't need 
a strong arm because the ball 
is getting to the plate a lot 
fa ter. The runner doesn't 
have a chance to take an extra 
ba e on you."
