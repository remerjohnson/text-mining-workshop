aleic Grabbed by Secret Service Agents In Sacramento 
In an effort to shake hands with presidential candidate and 

us. Senator Hubert Humphrey, Mike Palcic, candidate for the 
Republican nomination for the 80th Assembly District, and 
former ASUCSD President, was accosted and restrained by 
secret service agents Friday. The bizzare incident took place 
In the Sacramento state capitol where Palcic was meeting with 
legislators and consultants concerning his campaign . 

Shortly two more secret ervlce agent. and a few capitol 
policemen surrounded Palclc and began to question him 
Palcic ays he told them hiS name and hi s status as a candidate 
for public office. Not satisfied. accord 109 to Palcic, the agents 
continlMi to queslton him . 

directIOn Humphrey had gone and was agatn blocked bv tht' 
agents. AccordlOg to Palcic they told him If you ~o back up 
there we might have to knock you down ' 

Palcic then broke awav from the agents and the~' chased 
him to th UC Student Lobby Office There he picked up a 
camera and some paper and returned to Karabtan s ofhce to 
flOd that Humphrev had left for San FranCISco 

Palcic, a registered Republican and part of a group called 
the UCSD Radical Republicans, is running against John Stull , 
Assemblyman from the 80th District, in the June 6 primary . 
The 80th District includes the coast cities north of UCSD and 
pdrt of La Jolla . 

Palcic was in Sacramento to discuss his campaign with some 
legislators and Democratic consultants, including Vic Fazzio, 
the majority consultant for the Assembly. According to Palcic, 
one of the secretaries in Fazzio 's office told Palcic that Hubert 
Humphrey was in Democratic Assemblyman Walter 
Karabian 's office, and told him to " go meet Humphrey." 

" I then realized that they were worried that I was going to 
assassinate Humphrey ." Palcic said He then picked up his 
brief case, opened it for the agents to view and stated , "Look 
no bombs, no guns " 

"Then," according to Palcic, "one of the agents 'a ld , . Hey, 
he 's talking about bombs and guns.' .. 

Palcic then turned and went down the hall 10 the opPOsite 
direction from which Humphrey had been led , left hiS briefcase 
in an office, and returned to the agents to attempt to me t 
Humphrey again . Still the agents would not let him pass 

Palclc feel the IOcldent was a flagrant Violation of hi CIVtl 
nghts. He IS partlcularl\' angr\ at Humphrev 

"Hubert Humphrev turned hiS back on me.' Palclc tat d 
"Just as the rest of the Democratic Party turned their back 10 
Chicago 10 1968 " Moreover , Palclc feels that he allowed 
himself to be maOlpulated by secret service agents It 
worries me that a preSidential candidate can b .0 ea. ilv 
maOlpulated The cret service should protect him but not 
manipulate him ' " I then started screaming over and over , 'You 're vlOlatlOg 

my civil rights,' .. Palclc stated. 
"Prove It" 

Accosted by Agents 
After explaining hiS posllton as a candidate, one of the 

capitol policemen asked him to " prove it.· ' The poltceman and 
some of the secret ervice agents decided to take PalclC to th 
Secretary of State 's office to verify hiS status as a candidate 
En route to the Secretary of State's office, the capitol 
policeman left the group and thE' agents were replaced by 
other agents who had no Idea wh re the S cretan' of State 's 

Palclc was particularly up et b~ the IOcld nt because he 
con Ider himself to be a serious candidate for the Assembly 
seat and he feels that hiS campaign was treated flippantly ' I 
sincerelv want to be the next As emblvman from the 80th 
distnct :" he aid Positive Action 

Palcic went down to meet Humphrey and found the hall 
around Karabian's office crowded with secretaries and other 
capitol employees. Humphrey, according to Palcic, was 
shaking hands and signing autographs : "he was politicking." 
Palclc decided to meet Humphrey and walked to within about 
12 feet of him. As Palcic raised his hand to greet Humphrey, 
two federal secret service agents accosted him while another 
turned Humphrey around and ushered him down the hall , away 
from Palcic.

Committee requires the wisdom that acc~mpames t E'nur~ . He 
continued that the people on the committee mu t be like 
judges" 10 that they must pass unprE'judlced judgement~ wllh 
regard to promo lions and appointment . Moore ex pressed 
concern that the measure would "dilute the power of the 
committee." He concluded by pointing out the " probatIOnary 
nature" of non-tenured faculty member and expres ed hiS 
beltef that they hould not be in a position to grant tenure to 
other . 

Dr. Stoke!> from the Medical School defended the

Gay Porno-Flick Seized 
Orange County sheriffs seized the male homosexual film " 7 in a 

Barn," during a Thursday night (March 9) meeting of 'the UC 
Irvine Gay Students Union. The warrant was issued by Municipal 
Court Judge Robert E. Rickles William Hobbs, a member of the 
Orange County District Attorney 's Office , requested the warrant 
on .the basIs of a phone conversation with San Francisco police 
officers who had Viewed the Iilm. 

" Seven in a Barn" was to have been part of a Panel on 
P.ornography m. which legal and psychological professionals 
discussed explicitly sexual films with producer J . Brian. 

Producer J . Brian expressed total amazement at the sheriff's 
action: as "7 in a Barn" has had extended road showi ngs in San 
FranciSCO and Los Angeles . "This could only happen in Orange 
County," was his only comment. 

GOY. Addresses Principals 
o one knows better than those in thiS audience that now is a 

critical lime for public education in the United States. As school 
admini strators, you are on the firing line every da y with unhappy 
parents, tax weary citizens and a multitude of 'experts' in 
education looking over your shoulder. 

We have been going through a period of national fault-finding 
with our educatIOnal system . Let' s be honest and admit that much 
of this concern IS valid . Yet. to be objective. an appraisal should 
al 0 consider some of the strengths of publ ic education. 

Whatever its problems, and there are many. our school systems 
obViously are doing many things well. When 38 per cent of the 
entering freshmen at San FranCISCO State can gain sophomore 
standing through placement tests. how can anyone say that thp 
school system ha fa iled In Its ta k of preparing academically-
onented youngster for college?

enhanced. 

Over 400 people who 
attended a conference held in 
Santa Barbara March 17-20. 
took steps to ward th e 
formation of a national effort 
to encourage people to come to 
San Diego this August. Nearly 
60 organizations in the western 
hall of the United States were 
represented. In the words of a 
coalition member. "The Santa 
Barbara Conference took many 
of the necessary steps which 
will build trust between people 
in the Convention Coali tion and 
activists around the country." 

The Santa Ba r ba r a 
Statement reads as follows : 
" The Santa Ba rb ara 
conference of the San Diego 
Convention Coalition supports 
and considers as a basis of 
alliance the followi ng things . 

(1 I " We support an end to

of Third World Communities : 
techn ica l and economic 
assistance to groups organizing 
around the convention in Third 
World Communities : emphasis 
by white organizers on the 
issue of racism and the 
problems of working people in 
their own communities. 

(3) " An immedite end to all 
U .S . agg re ss io n and 
involvement in Indochina and 
support for the Prov isional 
Revolutionary Government of 
Vietnam's 7 point plan for 
peace : the major points of 
which are: That the U.S. 
troops. military personnel. 
weapons and war materials 
and those of its allies must be 
removed and the U.S. must 
stop backing the regime of 
Nguyen Van Thieu. 

(4 ) " We oppose all U.S. 
interfe rence in the internal 
affairs of other countries. 

(5) " The demonstrations we 
are planning for August should 
not be violent. 

(6) " No pa rty or preSidential 
candidate will be pushed 
through use of slogans or the 
speaker's pla tform in the 
demonstrations. In addition . 
we will not support any 
presidential candidate ."

for Assemblyman in the 80 district as well as being inaccurate. 
When he expressed his complaint in a letter to the Times. This 
is the reply he received : 

Dear Mr. Palcic : 
The Times published a wirephoto with a caption supplied by 

the ASSOCiated Press recording the incident involving you and 
the Secret Service regarding Sen. Humphrey. 

The Times has no reason to dispute the accuracy of either the 
picture or the caption. The Times did not cover the incident. 

Sincerely.

wa generally favorable. Terry 
Barak. a graduating senior. 
was ecstatic to find that he 
could now get out of taking his 
Cultural Traditions course on 
African Cult ure , " It ' s 
refreshing to see the MUir 
requirements changed to allow 
more student self-expression 
and flexibility. for instance. I 
greatly resented being forced 
to take a class which was 
des igned to foster fa lse racia I 
pnde Courses such as th is 
were implemented by guilty 
liberals who were backed IO to a 
corner by student activists 
seeking greater harmonv 
between the races. But course's 
such as thi s one aren't the wa y 
to get it , and no one should be 
forced to ta ke them ... 

Mark Siegel. a Revelle 
student. noted. " I think it gives 
the Mui r student more freedom 
in his self -expression. but I 
imagme there are few Muir 
students who are motiva ted 
enough to take adva ntage of 
such an open curriculu m." 
Marcu Woersching. a lso a 
Revelle student. said " l think it 
eliminates a lot of irrelevant 
courses not needed for the 
student 's educational growth." 

Holly Ingraham . a Revelle 
student. disa l!reed with the 
changes : " I think it will 

lower the standards of the 
college and I think such a 
curriculum will narrow MUIr 
students as people." Valene 
Story. a Muir student. th ink 
that the requirement sh uld 
be broadened even more 
"They should all ow any 
sequence of upper-divlslon 
courses to staisfy (he 
requ irements rather than 
forcing a student to take a 
boring . r sequence." An 
urbane and attractive female 
student who wished to rema in 
anonymous expressed a less 
enthusiastiC attitude: " I don't 
give a shit what happens at 
Muir. because I'm a Revelle 
student. ' .

A Case For Reality 
h) G lena l' hroel(' r 

Are you looking for something different , 
something that can give meaning and purpose 
to your life - that is, purpose beyond what you 
Cdn muster up for yourself in the name of 
science, humanism, or any number of man-
made philosophies; I have one question to ask 
YOU : - have you ever taken Jesus seriously ? 
Be honest with yourself. Have you seriously 
tried to know Him ? Maybe you're not in the 
mood to be serious about Jesus. Ma ybe you're 
sick of hearing about it. Maybe your mind is 
already made up against Him ... ? Whatever 
your case may be. I'd like to share mine. 

I think it is a prevalent attitude today that 
all Christians are ex-dopers. or have had some 
sort of unstable, wandering past This is true 
in millions of cases. but don 't think that just 
because you are " making it" in the world , and 
supposedly facing " reality." that you don 't 
need Jesus. 

Something that really distresses me is when 
people say that Christians aren't facing 
reality. This is the ultimate paradox . God is 
the only one who can show us reality. "God is 
light, and in Him there is no darkness at all " (I 
John 1.5 ). When He shines His light in our 
heart , it usually isn't very pleasant. Reality 
isn 't very pleasant. Don't think everything 
becomes beautiful when a per on asks Christ 
into hi s life. His light is revealing , He tells you 
the truth - "The heart IS more deceitful than 
all else and IS despera tely sick, Who can 
understand it?" !Jeremiah 17 91. That's nght 
- desperately Sick . Think about It 

What' s In your heart? If Jesus is in your 
heart - thai's outta sight. because He's the 
only one who can cure the disease (SIN I . 
Though Chmt cures us ultimately. as long as 
we are human. we won 't be immune to sin. We 
need constant. continual healing. and It IS 
often painful It IS especially painful when we 
resist Him and refuse to face realltv Once we 
willingly submit ourselves to Him and qUit 
rebelling a~amst the reality He shows us In 
ourselves - once we can sec and admit what 's 
inSide of us - then. bv the power of Christ's 
blood (shed on the Cross remember? lour 
hearts Will be cleansed . With a clean heart . 
God can fill us with His Holy pint and we 
begin to live the abundant life He planned for 
us 

Ever-present Reality 
Now do we stop faCing reality? No Wayl The 

SinS of man are ever-present. and we 

continually must face this reality , 
appropriating always the precious blood of 
Chri t. 

Is Christianity then merely repenting from 
sin over and over? You missed the point. The 
point is the abundant life. Even more 
important is how to get it, and why you 
deserve it. First of all, you don 't deserve it 
(" And all our righteous deeds a-re like a filthy 
garment ," Isaiah 64 :6). but God loves you ,and 
has an infinite amount of love to give you. So 
how can you know that love? How can you live 
the "abundant" (full and meaningful ) life? 
Simply by taking Jesus at His word 
(Revelation 3:20). and letting Him come in. 
Maybe you already guessed that answer 
before you read it. Maybe you thought. "Oh 
yeah - right - accept Jesus and all my 
problems will be solved." Sorry to disappoint 
you , but not quite. 

True. inviting Jesus into your heart is 
simple - it is also the first and most 
important step. And why shouldn 't God make 
the step over to life simple for those He loves 
so much ? However. Chri t's purpose isn't to 
put us in ivory towers on earth (perhaps in 
heaven !) . If we are truly following Him and 
"continually seeking His face " (as He 
commanded In I Ch rOnicles 16: 11 ). He will be 
contmually teaflng down and rebUilding into 
our lives. We will see reality. and He will ask 
us to do omething about it. That something -
the one thing H will ever ask you to do - is to 
let Him work In and through you : let Him 
Indwell your earthl y body and complete His 
purpose through you 

AD IDterDal Revolution 
You say the world is rotten and needs to be 

changed'; Right on. But who can change the 
world ' What 's the root of all Its problems7 
What needs to be changed? [ can tell you what 
needs to be changed - PEOPLE We need 
cleansed hearts - pure with the love of God 
Only when individuals are changed Will the 
world change. It needs to be a unique 
revolution - an mternal one. It is happening In 
millions of lives today Can you dellv It? Do 
you want it too? Mayb yOU just want to knoll' 
more about It. If so. why not start reading Ihe 
Bible, and ask God to help you find Him . He i, 
faithful de pile our doubts . Go ahead. The 
critical factor IS merelv your will. Are \OU 
willing to give Jesus Christ a chance to show 
you reality?

Question : What Is natural food and why is it

Answer : Natural toods are those grown under 
the conditions nature Imposes on the 
growing ammal 01' plant. ThiS means no 
chem ical lertlllzers to Increase the growth 
rate above that achieved Irom the natura l

Question : What does the word "organic" on a 
label mean? 

Answer : As far as natural lood IS concerned 

the word "organic " on a label doesn 'tmean 
a thlng ' It ·s a npoff' Accordmg to Webster. 
" organic" is applied to substances 
containing carbon I'm sure If you -VI' had

Monday, April 3. 

The demonstration . 
sponsored by the UCSD Mu ic 
Department. IS one in a series 

The two plays. presented as a 
double bill on the same 
evening. have been playing to 
capacity audiences since they 
opened Feb. 17. The demand 
for tickets has exceeded the 
capacity of the new 200-seat 
UCSD Theatre at almost all of 
the performances. 

According to Eric Christmas. 

8. and at UC Davis on April 9. 
The trip is being sponsored 

by the Universi tv -wide 
l illercampus Cuitural 
Exchange Committee . 
According to Christmas. the 
trip could mark the beginning 
of an Intercampus Repertory 
Company that would be based

Here it is. the first of the

old Spring-Quarter-
Where -Am-I-Going -; u-

you 've got now is fa lling 

apart at the beams. If you have to listen to 

going to find out what an apartment should 
really be like .. like fully bUilt-in kitchens. 
terrifiC bedrooms. carpeting. drapes. and a 
private patio outside your door And. perhaps 
best of all. all of this is less than five minutes 
from campus 

that tap danCing clown upstairs for one more 
night. you 're going to knock him for a couple 

of frUit loops Is that what's troubling you. Bunky? 
WEll, STEP RIGHT UP SON, GET YOURSELF 

A ROOMMATE AND RENT YOURSELF A liTTLE 
PEACE OF MIND AT lA JOllA VillAGE. 

Look at It thiS way. If you and a friend go In on a 
place 11'11 cost you as little as S 72 50 a month 
The money you're paYing for Ihe dive you're 

living in now can buy you a little more 
happiness and a whole lot more 

comfort and convenience 
It s the lilLe thmgs Like two huge swimming pools 

Or. maybe you'd like to lie around In the JacuzzI 
until your body turns 10 lelly tt might even be a fnendly 

game of pool In the billiards room. for pink slips 
And when yol,; f.nd your way to your apartmen 
after an evening In the fireSide lounge. you're
