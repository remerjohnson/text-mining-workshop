Students Face Less of a 
Crunch on Move-In Day 
Thousands of freshmen and sophomores move in over weekend 
IJ VINCENT GRAQNANI 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD students are being housed in tempo-
rary spaces for the fourth year in a row, 
although ma", reported that the weekend 
move-in process ran smoothly. 

At Warren college, cars began lining up at 
Saturday at 7:15 a.m. By 9:30 a.m., over 6S cars 
were lined up along Justice Lane and Voigt 
Drive. 

According to Gem Spikes. assistant resident 
dean at Warren college, the move-in of about 
1,400 students went well. 

"It's been going really smoothly,· she said. 
"People have been very patient." 

She added that Warren has the only "drive-
in move-in,· where people can drive right up to 
their apartments and residence halls allowing 
easier access. There were 75 returning students 
on hand assisting with the process. 

This year, Warren had fewer than 50 stu-
dents housed in temporary spaces, and an addi-
tional 40 are. being housed at Revelle, according 
to Spikes. 

"It's interesting that we have more students 
this year at Warren but less of a crunch; she 
said. 

At Marshall college, Resident Dean Yolanda 
Trevino said only a few students there were 
being housed in temporary spaces. She added 
that for the first time in at least four years, all 
Marshall students were being housed at 
Marshall. 

For the first time in four years, Muir college 
did not house any students in temporary 
spaces. 

Muir Resident Dean Pat Danlyshyn-Adams 
said that this year, Muir is housing about a 
dozen students from other colleges. She said 
those students were given a choice between liv-
ing in a temporary space at their own college or 
in a permanent space at Muir. 

In the past, Muir created temporary spaces 
by converting rooms designed for student orga-
nizations into student housing. 

Danlyshyn-Adams said she is pleased that 
those rooms have been reconverted to house

Parking Facilities 
Create Nearly 
1,000 New Spaces 
Due to north campus 
construction, students will find 
fewer spaces than last year 
By VINCENT GRAGNANI 
Senior Staff Writer 

The new Gilman Parking Structure. which 
contains 858 parking spaces, opened Monday 
at 7 a. m. after a year of construction. 

However, Director of Parking and 
Transportation Services Greg Snee said that 
the opening does not necessarily mean relief 
for students looking for more convenient 
parking. 

Snee said that due to the closing of the 
north parking lots. there are now fewer stu-
dent spaces than there were in the spring . 

"This fall, we anticipate that occupancy in 
our '5' student spaces will be tight until Oct. 
16, when new spaces become available in the 
east campus," Snee said. "The occupancy rate 
will again be eased in winter 2001 with the 
opening of the North Torrey Pines Road 
Structure." 

The Gilman structure, will include 311 
student spaces and 171 metered spaces, as 
well as spaces for faculty, staff and disabled 
pe<iple. 

The USE Credit Union will open its new 
facilities on the south facade of the structure 
later in the academic year. On the west side of 
the structure, a new campus parking office 
will open, which will consolidate all parking 
sales, ride sharing and parking citation adjudi-
cation services. 

There are 211 new spaces on the east side 
of campus, representing the final phase of the 
Regents Lot, which contains a total of 1,500 
spaces. 

The North Torrey Pines Road structure 
will contain 961 spaces. While the structure 
was originally scheduled to open this fall, the 
opening has been delayed by unexpected 
complexities in the soil excavated at the site. 
according to Snee. The structure will include 
370 student spaces. 

Construction on the north side of campus 
caused not only the closing of north parking. 
but also the closing of portions of Scholars 
Drive North and Salk Institute Road.

Preuss School Welcomes Students to its New Building 
Charter school moves from Marshall College to a permanent $13.1 million, 75, 000 square-foot facility 

--..... IJ AUXJ. LEI 
Associate News Editor 

Sept. 5 marked the grand 
opening of the new $13.1 million 
Preuss School campus at UCSD. 

Completed only 17 months 
after its groundbreaking, the 
75,OOO-square foot facility 
enrolled a total of 431 new and 
returning Preuss School students 
earlier this month. 

In addition, the campus is cen-
tered around an outdoor 
amphitheater designed to accom-
modate the entire student body 
for performances and assemblies. 

One of the five classroom 
wings is dedicated to state-of-
the-art science laboratories, 
equipped with lab benches and 
fume hoods. All classroom wings 
are wired for extensive computer 
use and are interconnected by 
covered walkways and overhead 
steel trellises. 

Selected from a lottery of 503 
applicants, last year's 150 sixth, 
seventh and eighth graders set a 
precedent as students at the only 
public charter school in the state 
to be established on a university 
campus with private donations 
and capital. 

and interns. 
The mission of the Preuss 

School is to prepare low-income 
and educationally underserved 
students for admission to and 
graduation from a university. All 
students will take four years of 
mathematics, laboratory sciences 
and English, three years of fine 
arts and foreign language, and 
two years of history. This year's 
curriculum will include new 
classes in community service and 
music appreciation and a choi is 
planned as well. An expanded 

The new campus includes five 
two-story classroom wings, 
administrative and library buird-
ings, a multipurpose student cen-
ter and an expansive sports field. 

Last fall , the Marshall campus 
provided temporary quarters 
when the school first opened. 

Heading the staff this year is 
founding principal Doris Alvarez. 
Assisting her is a larger faculty of 
22 teachers recruited from 
throughout the United States, 
compared to last year's faculty of 
seven .

Although George W Bush and Al Gore se'~ pale in comparison td past 
presidents such as Kennedy, Franklin Roosevelt and the Gipper, there is hope 

By ALEX J. LEE I 
Senior Staff Writer 

Another four years, another presi-
dential election. Who really seems to 
care? If last year's low, if not pathetic. 
tum out for UCSD's AS elections was 
any indication, it would appear this 
year's presidential election will not be 
all that different. Alas, apathy will 
again reign supreme. Exactly why do 
we care so little? Perhaps the answer 
lies not so much in our laziness, but 
more in our negative perceptions of 
the candidates. 

Whether AI Gore or George W. 
Bush would be an adequate presi-
dent is hotly debated. Whether either 
candidate can be a great president, 
however, is a question almost never 
asked. The general consensus is that 
both men are poor candidates, or as 
Michael Bernstein, professor of his-
tory at UCSD, so eloquently 
quipped, "If the test of greatness is 
the ability to anticipate the great 
tides of history, they both fall very 
short indeed." 

The tired question seems appropri-
ate right about now: What exactly 
makes a great president? For many, 
personality is the first thing that comes 
to mind; someone who inspires the 
masses. Unfortunately, most presi-
dents, past and present, have had little 
luck in this department. Then again, 
should campaign imagery really matter 
so much? 

"Why do we have to be theater crit-
ics?" asked a reporter recently on 
NBC's "Meet the Press." "Why does 
IGore) have to be scintillating?" 

In our video-saturated culture, the 
answer is a screaming "yes'" A presi-
dential candidate has all the more 
advantage if he can win in front of the 
camera. John F. Kennedy was one of 
the first to use that advantage when he 
stepped onto the floor of the 1960 
Democratic Convention in Los 
Angeles. With an 80,OOO-strong 
Coliseum audience and 35 million 
Americans watching on television, he 

~Vhat exactly makes a great

have had little luck in this 
department. 

immediately seized their attention with 
his magnetic presence of youth, chann 
and energy. In those turbulent times, 
he challenged the nation to meet 
obstacles head on. Many listened. As 
for how "great" he was as a president, 
no one can really say. His presidency 
was cut far too short. Nevertheless, 
many Americans today still regard him 
as such, a testament to his alluring 
charm. 

The "Great Communicator" him-
self also took advantage of flirting with 
the limelight. Although the greatness 
of his presidency is a matter still hotly 
contested, there's no doubt Ronald 
Reagan had a talent for connecting 
with his audience. For instance, as he 
was wheeled into surgery after being 
shot, he quipped, "I hope you're an 
Republicans." Such was his talent of 
using humor to connect with people 
and ward off his fears. Although it is 
not a suggestion that Reagan was 
great, he did show how a little person-
ality could go a long way for a presi-
dent. The American pUblic must have 
agreed, re-electing him to a second 
term in office by a phenomenal mar-
gin. 

As for Bush and Gore, their on-
screen personas pale in comparison. 
Not surprisingly, their caricatures 
seem to elicit mor't of a response than 
they do themselves. In other words, it 
is more exciting to poke fun at and 
ridicule them than to watch them in 

real life, especially when it comes to 
the stigmas both have earned. 

Bush's label is just as unflattering, 
that of the Grand Old Party's stuck-
up, arrogant puppet. It does not help 
that both candidates are conventional 
in the issues and policies they advo-
cate. Then again, times have changed, 
and the economy is strong, Many 
would argue, why change a good 
thing? 

Perceptions of Bush continue to 
change as to who he is and whether 
he is qualified for a job as large and 
intricate as the presidency of the 
United States. In a recent article in the 
New York Times, critics picked apart his 
past, concluding that the opportuni-
ties Bush came across were more a 
result of George Bush Sr. than any 
accomplishment the former may have 
achieved on his own. This reputation 
is one Bush has tried to shed; that of a 
son both pampered and overshad-
owed by his famous, overachieving 
father. 

By now it has become almost trite 
to accuse Gore of being stiff and 
robotic. Oddly enough, if there is one 
thing authentic about Gore, it is that 
he is an awkward speaker. Most iron-
ic is how the media, which always 
claims its desire for authenticity, con-
tinues to push Gore to be something 
he is not. 

Yet another popular response as 
to what qualifies as greatness would 
be how effectively a president 
responds to crises such as war or 
c;conomic recession . It can be gener-
ally believed that both are important 
ingredients in making a great presi-
dent. Like anything else that 
becomes memorable, a great presi-
dent is the culmination of many 
things. 

For one thing, it usually is not 
something purely personal, such as 
charisma. Let us not forget, how great 
a president becomes has a lot to do 
with the period in history.

Leaving La Jolla offers a world of new experiences

SHANNON CASTlE 

Hey, fellow UCSD students. 
Welcome back to La Jolla. 

Notice I did not welcome you to 
San Diego. That is not where we 
are. As misleading as the school's 
name may be, this fine institution is 
located in La Jolla, Calif., and as 
any loyal La Jollan will point out,

areas of town. While giving you 
travel ideas, I hope I can also give 
those of you who care a glimpse 
into my personality .... 

Hop onto Interstate S going 
south, go past the aiJport, and you 
are smack in the middle of down-
town San Diego. In the area affec-
tionately known as the Gaslamp 
District, you will find a plethora of 
restaurants, some fun dubs and the 
ever-present bars. Those of you who 
can IWrIlY . drink, however, have 
probab already found this area of 
town. I I move on for your sake. 

Just north of downtown is 

from San Diego. While it is perfectly

favorite restaurants 
and a tiny mecca of

of fun, s.hopping 
and awesome food. 

many people spend feasible to survive

years here without

explain. 

I was inspired to write this bit of 
wisdom last night when giving 
directions to some dear friends of 
mine who shall remain anonymous. 
I was trying to tell them how to get 
to a concert in Point Lorna, a{ld I 
started out by telling them to get on 
Interstate 8. The next question they 
had was "How do we get there?" 

My point here, of course, is that 
if you even pretend to reside in San 
Diego, you should know the major 
frttways, of which 1-8 is one. Those 
of you who livc in EI Centro are 
probably ~Iin~ really smart ri~ht 
now, but wait; I m not done ranung 
yet. 

As I have stated, I am instructing 
all of you to get out of the bound-
aries of the University City area. 
While it is perkctIy feasible to sur-
vive by traveling bac1t and forth from 
campus to home to La jolla Village 
Square, it is not very much fun. Go 
chedt out the real San Diego. 

While this huge city is way too 
big to summarize in the 300 or so 
words I have left, I am going to give 
you a little peek into my favorite 

they are part of the city. They will 
definitely give you a better close of 
reality than what the rich, white La 
Jolla crowd offers. To add some 
color to your day, go chedt out the 
murals in Chicano Park. They are 
much better than the Sun God. 

Fmally, I would like to get a per-
sonal chip off my shoulder by 
explaining to all of you that there

North County. Go up Interstate lS 
or J-S for awhi1c, and you hit a 
whole bunch of suburbs that, like 
La jolla, are separate cities but basi-
cally part of San Diego. My person-
al favorite is Poway. Come visit 
sometime; we are really boring. If 
you have something against Poway, 
I am sure our editor in chief would 
love to give you a tour of San 
Marcos. 

Well, folks, we'vc corne to the end 
of our tour. If you choose to ignore 
my advice and spend the remainder 
of your time here in the same square 
rniIe, then do me one favor: Don't 
claim you live in San Diego, because 
you don't. You are in La jolla. 

The UCSD Guardian OPINION AS 

Grasping life's daunting lessons 
A slow summer gives a chance to reflect and to regain a lost passion 
.,TOIIVU 
Opinion Edit or 

I spent my second summer in 
San Diego expecting, truthfully, 

- not much to happen. I thought 
things would be like last sum-
mer: work, summer classes, 
hanging out with friends, and 
suffering through the insuffer-
able heat and humidity. For the 
most part. on a day-to-day basis, 
things were like that. 

Reminiscing now, as I sit in a 
plane back to Sacramento, I real-
ize these past three months have 
been anything but ordinary -
extraordinary, perhaps. 

Thmultuous events occurred 
over the summer, buried beneath 
the everyday doldrums that I 
stumbled through, eyes half 
closed, mind half processing. 
Even as a 20-year-old, soon to be 
21-year-old student, graduati~g 
in June 2001, there are aspects In 
my life to which I am continu-
ously adjusting. 

Perhaps we never stop trying 
to adjust to the ever-changing 
world around us, similar to how 
a person never stops growing or 
learning. Whatever the case, I 
have conn: to a new realization of 
friendships, of school, of what I 
want to do upon graduation, and 
of who I am. I would like to share 
with everyone these insights as I 
recount some of these events . 

Summer started rough, with

Public affairs had great pres-
tige from the 1930s to the 
1 9605. The federal government 
played a more significant role in 
helping the country from the 
Depression, World War II and 
the Cold War. Government cor-
ruption has increased in the last 
few decades, making the public 
more and more wary of its polit-
icalleaders. Also contributing to 
this trend by establishing a 
sense misplaced trust, has been 
the advent of neoliberalism, the 
idea that government is the 
problem and the market is the 
solution.

my grandfather hospitalized at 
the end of finals week. My broth-
er's close friend, also a friend of 
mine, was diagnosed with a brain 
tumor. During the first week of 
summer, when I was in Saft Jose 
to visit my grandfather in the 
hospital and to see my brother's 
friend, I had a falling out with one 
of the closest friends I ever had. 

It was difficult, to say the 
least, to see my brother's friend , 
only 25 years old and full of life 
and humor, condemned to such 
an end. Yet the hardest part was 
that all I could do was try to act 
as if everything was normal, that 

not glorify the past, too much, 
either. Today's presidential can-
didates may seem dull and bor-
ing, but the truth is, that has usu-
ally been the case. Critics mourn 
the loss of inspired speech and 
serious debate. 

Interestin~ly enough, howev: 
er, America s candidates have 
almost always been lackluster. 
The conventions they spoke at 
were no different: very tedious 
affairs frauglit with long, winding 
speeches and corny propaganda. 
Perhaps the way we would like to 
remember the great presidents of 
the past is more of a distorted 
reality, a nostalgic remembrance, 
forgetting that the candidates 
were human beings with frailties 
and imperfections like everyone 
else. 
. Most importantly, today's 
political system has changed 
considerably. Soft money and 

everything was fine, all the while 
knowing that this might be the 
last time I would see him. 

Harder still was the accep-
tance that my relationship with a 
dear friend , a friend whom I have 
always depended upon, and with 
whom I have always been truth-
ful, even until the very end, had 
run its course. We shared so 
much together. I still feel a little 
empty inside whenever I happen 
to drive down curvy Expedition 
Road toward downtown La Jolla, 

These two events have made 
me realize the fragility of friend-
ships, even a close one. and of life 
in general. Nothing lasts forever, 
even a friendship built on a solid 
three-year foundation . A long-
time companion could be gone 
tomorrow because of some mis-
understanding, or hell, even a 
brain tumor, 

Because of this, I appreciate 
the friends I have now, much 
more than I did before. I have 
endeavored to re-establish old 
friendships lost through the 
years, solidify current friendsh ips 
and make new ones over the 
summer. Perhaps it is true that a 
person cannot have too many 
friends, 

As a result of what took place 
earlier in the summer, however, I 
have regained my passion for 
things I thought lost. In my

special interests are the new 
power players in shaping policy

Both parties frequently accuse 
each other of hypocrisy. For

limes have changed and so 
have the perceptions we have of 
our leaders. True leadership is 
much more complex than giving 
fancy speeches and having stellar 
looks. It is a combination of 
charm, intelligence and a lot of 
common sense. As fol' campaign 
2000 and its candidates, it would 
be wise to advise voters to choose 
the lesser of two evils.

Associate Opinion Editor 

Like many UCSD students 
who spent this past summer with-
ering away in cubicles, I was mis-
led by the widespread notion that 
summer is all about freedom, end-
less days at the beach and wild 
parties, all in no particular order. 
Was I in for a shock. 

Due to unforeseeable circum-
stances, my parents cajoled me into 
finding a full-time job this summer 
so I could spend my days eaming 
cash while others tanned in Tahiti. 

Luckily, I found a job quite 
quickly through a friend of my sis-
ter (this just goes to show that net-
working does exist), working as a 
receptionist in a lawyers' suite in 
downtown Los Angeles. So, each 
morning, Monday through Friday, 
I sat wistfully in rush-hour traffic, 
dreaming of clear beaches while a 
sea of adults glided by me in 
Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs. 

Do not mistake me fpr a lazy, 
indolent child. I am grateful to have 
had the opportunity to earn extra 
money, as I have a few friends who 
were desperately seeking well-pay-
ing jobs these past months. 
Personally, I felt a little stifled by the 
responsibility of taking up to 60 
calls a day for 14 law firms while 
maintaining a fixed smile each time 
a prospective client sauntered in. 

No one ever said working would 
be easy - especially with lawyers. 
At least I came away with some 
valuable lessons. gleaned from my 
experiences working with mature 
and immature adults with Ivy 
League backgrounds. I will now 
share these lessons with you. 

First, remain focused on your

dreams or at least have a reason-
able and attainable goal. For 
example, a 4.0 grade point average 
your entire UCSD career is not a 
particularly realistic goal, at least 
for me. My goal was to survive the 
embarrassment of a few adults 
screaming in my ears that the mis-
pronunciation of one syllable 
could ruin their entire company. 

I did survive, though, albeit with 
severe emotional scars and the real-

No one ever said 
working would be easy. 
Especially with lawyers. 

Ye~ at least I came away 
with some valuable 
lessons, gleaned from my 
experiences working with 
mature and immature 
adults with Ivy League 
backgrounds that I will 
now share with you, 
ization that I never want to be a sec-
retary again. Yes. it sounds incredi-
bly corny, but if you want to 
become a lawyer or anything else in 
life for that maner, do not expect it 
to come to you on a silver planer. 

Second, if you find your dream 
job sucks, quit and find ' another 
one. I have witnessed firsthand the 
exasperated comments of parale-
gals, lawyers and secretaries. who 
have either told me through their 
body language, frown lines and red 
eyes, or directly, not to go into 
something for the wrong reasons. 
One of these "wrong" reasons was 

.....................

money, though I know firsthand 
that lots of cash is quite tempting. 

Third, for God's sake, people, 
lighten up! I am not sure if this is 
a trait applicable only to high-paid 
lawyers whose stress latches onto 
them like a remora onto a shark 
(bio majors know what I'm talking 
about), but I have come to realize 
that suffering lhrough tedious 
conversations in which the other 
party never smiled, never joked, 
never made me think that my pre-
sumption that they were an 
android instead of a human being, 
was wrong. 

This could be avoided if people 
would work to live rather than the 
other way around. I admit, it may be 
selfish of me to want a person I am 
conversing with to be humorous or 
light-hearted, but I figure it is really 
not that hard to accomplish. All it 
takes is a smile, a laugh and a posi-
tive attitude, and presto! You have a 
healthy adult (and UCSD student). 

Last but not least, do not take 
your failures too seriously. As a 
wanna-be adult, I can attest to the 
fact that I have made more mis-
takes working for 10 weeks than all 
the past presidential administra-
tions combined. 

I guess working in ·a corporate 
office was not so bad after all. 
Take away screaming lawyers, 
phones ringing off the hook, and 
shady clients, and you get some 
valuable life lessons for free. On 
the other hand, I will probably 
never want to do it again. I have 
decided that next summer, instead 
of spending my time earning cash 
and lines on my resume, I am set-
tling for the beaches of Tahiti. I 
doubt I would ever have to wait in 
rush-hour traffic there. 

mfNUTI5 in brief 

rushed college life, filled with 
papers on the Ptloponnesian War 
and American political parties, 
homework on heteroscedasticity 
and oligopolies. an Ilndless stream 
of midterms and finals, and 
appointments with friends. I was 
constantly looking two, three days. 
even weeks ahead. But the lazy 
days of summer gave me a chance 
to slow down, to look at life at a 
slower, more enjoyable pace. 

But slowing down wasn't 
entirely up to me. A pinched 
nerve as a result of spons certain-
ly slowed my pace for about a 
month. After barely being able to 
walk for two weeks, it took me 
another two to get my leg 
responding correctly. 

In all, I learned not to take 
what I have around me for grant-
ed. My appreciation for the small-
er things in life had returned: tak-
ing a walk on La Jolla Shores at 
night, sitting on the cliffs, listen-
ing to the waves break on the 
rocks below, or just spending a 
quiet 'evening with a friend in a 
coffee shop. Now, just being able 
to walk normally is something I 
enjoy with a fervor. 

With the slower pace of sum-
mer, I had the great opportunity to 
volunteer my time to help on 
Assemblywoman Susan Davis' 
congressional campaign. I have 
always been fascinated by politics 
since the sixth grade. Similar to 
everything else, my enthusiasm for 
politics was put on the back burn-
er for the past couple of years. 

Working on the campaign and 
meeting the people involved in 
this huge grass-roots effort 
brought 'back this fascination and

Strangely enough, and it 
seems just as odd to my ears as I 
am sure it does to you, I found 
myself looking forward to classes 
by the end of summer. Instead of 
dreading the start o~ the quarter, I 
felt the same way I did the sum-
mer before I started my college 
career: anxious to start a new life. 

My good friend William 
Shakespeare compared life to an 
"insubstantial pageant faded ." 

"We are such stuff as dreams 
are made on: Shakespeare 
wrote, "and our little life is 
rounded with a sleep." I admit, 
perhaps for the last two or so 
years I have been living in a 
dream world , something a lot of 
college students are guilty of. We 
get so caught up in the daily 
despondency that we walk 
around campus like automatons, 
going to class but not really 
being there, mentally. We ~ke 
what we have around us for 
granted: friends that care for us, 
our health , and even the ocean 
and the smell of freshly ground 
coffee beans. We take these 
things for granted at least until 
we lose them. 

I am glad to say however, that 
my eyes are now open and I can 
finally rest peacefully. As a friend 
I once knew had written to me, 
"Good morning ... I can sleep 
now."

Surviving FaIl '00 
Some advice to help the young ones through the first quarter 
Senior Staff Writer 

You can always pick out the freshmen 
at UCSD. They are the ones with the 
dazed looks on their faces, the looks that 
say, "My God, this place is huge! It's going 
to take hours to get from York to Warren 
Lecture Hall!" They may be taller than 
some with more experience, but some-
thing about makes them seems particular-
ly dwarfed by the eucalyptus groves, Geisel 
Library and AP&M. 

After surviving only one year at UCSD 
myself, I certainly have not experienced 
everything. I can, however, give all the 
freshmen tips so as to avoid the mistakes I 
made. 

You are definitely going to need a map, 
especially for the first few days. I still carry 
one around with me just in case I get lost 
or need to help campus visitors with direc-
tions. I know many of you are thinking 
that the maps are huge and will be a dead 
giveaway to everyone else that you don't 
know what you are doing. However, if you 
go to EDNA, the campus information 
window in the Price Center, the employees 
will give you a one-page map the size of a 
normal piece of paper. If you use these 
expertly, people will think you · are just 
looking over your latest essay. 

Class scheduling can be a nightmare. 
Remember, though, unlike high school 
you can easily reschedule classes within 
the first week or so. You will end up with a 
different professor but you might end up 
saving some sanity. 

Unless you are truly a morning per-
son, you probably will not want 8 a.m. 
classes. I had one 8 a.m. class fall quarter 
of my freshman year, and it took all my 
effon to stay awake in the class despite 
the antics of the professor and my interest 
in the class. 

Another important thing to remember 
is that you are not gcing to want all your 
classes in a solid block. Of course, you do 
not want them too spread out either, but 
be sure to give yourself a lunch break or 
you'll get swamped with too much infor-
mation at once. A SO-minute college class 
is a lot longer than a 55-minute high 
school class. Professors fit their entire talk 
into one lecture by warping space-time to 
avoid defying the theory of relativity. 

An important property of the eating 
establishments on campus is that they are 
all different. There is at least one at every 
college and most of them have one thing 
they do better than the rest. The Price 
Center also has restaurants, but eating 
there may not be for those low on ca~h or 
low on metabolism. The same thing 
applies to the eateries off campus: The 
school is commonly referred to as UC La 
Jolla because it is in an upper-middle class 
pan of town, and the restaurants, gas sta-
tions and other businesses nearby feel jus-
tified overcharging people with large dis-
posable incomes . 

A good idea for freshmen, especially 
commuters, is to get involved with clubs 
or student leadership. Look for things 

Something on

that interest you; there are over 300 stu-
dent organizations on campus. You will 
meet new people this way and also be 
able to attend events you enjoy to get . 
your mind off your chemistry final or a 
Making of the Modern World paper. Do 
not be afraid to join something. No one 
will force you to stay in an organization 
you do not want to be in any longer. Who 
knows, you might meet some people with 
whom you will make lasting bonds. I 
know I did whcn I joined the Pep Band 
and Darkstar. 

In my freshman year, I had one of the 
most difficult lifestyles to enjoy college 
with: I w'ts a commuter. I did not have 
roommates or suitemates to bond with 
like most freshmen, and I had at times a 
45-minute drive from school to my house. 
As bad as it sounds, once I figured out 
how to handle it, I began to really enjoy 
myself at UCSD. 

Commuters need to find out how long 
their commute takes. Depending on how 
far away you live, you will need to leave 
early at first to get used to all the road 
conditions. I suggest for those who live 15 
or more miles away that you start out 
leaving 45 minutes earlier than you think 
you need to. I know this sounds obscene, 
but you will only need it for a few days 
until you figure out the time it takes you. 
Even though San Diego does not have 
snow, it does have rain, a bit of hail and a 
whole lot of fog. These all worsen the 
road conditions and make traffic some-
what erratic. 

On-campus parking is horrendous. 
. Never depend on meter parking; it will not 
be there when you need it. I recommend 
getting a parking permit and using the 
Nonh, East and Regents parking lots for 
all they are worth . 

The free campus shuttles will take you 
around pretty much wherever you want to 
go in less time than the nigh-impossible 
task of finding close parking. 

For those who don't live close to 
UCSD, you need '0 find places to hang 
out on campus. Rtvelle has a commuter 
lounge where all commuters are welcome, 
in fact encouraged, to hang out during 
their off time. Warren has a computer lab 
especially for commuters. Some clubs 
have offices on campus where their mem-
bers hang out regularly. In the Price 
Center, there is a fairly well-hidden game 
room, and the Library Lounge. 

Of course, there is always Geisel 
Library. Geisel is my favorite place to write 
essays or do homework because there are 
very few distractions. It also has this 
atmosphere as if every thesis ever discard-
ed within the confines is floating around 
in the air to be recycled into something 
usable by other students. 

Places to hang out are important to 
help you avoid leaving campus during 
rush hour. Basically, it's not a good idea to 
leave campus between 3:30 p.m. and 5:30 
p.m. 

In summary, study hard, play hard,. 
watch the roads and I'll see you around at 
Geisel. EVERY SUNDAY NIGHT @ 8pm

~D& NATION-
China -is Said to Have Rearrested Bishop 

BEijING - An 81-year-old 
Roman Catholic bishop in 
southern China. who spent a 
total of over 30 years in prison 
for his loyalty to the Vatican. was 
rearrested last week. a Catholic 
foundation in the United States 
said Sunday. 

If confirmed, the latest arrest 
of Bishop Zen~ Jingmu of 
Jiangxi province IS a particular 
setback for the Clinton adminis-
tration and I slip in the face for 
the Vatican. . 

In early 1998, as President 
Clinton prepared to visit China, 
U.S. officials sought Zeng's early 
release from a labor camp, where 
he had been sent in 1995 for 
holding unauthorized religious 
serYices. 

When Zeng was freed in May 
1998, six months before his 
three-year sentence expired, 
Clinton and other officials called 
it a hopeful sign that Clinton's 
policy of constructive enga$C-
ment with China was "beanng 
fruit,· in the words of James R. 
Sasser, the U.S. ambassador to 
China at that time. 

Since his aTTest, Zeng, 
who is described by 
associates as frail, has 
reportedly been kept 
under house aTTest with 
tight police 
surveillance. 

Since his release, Zeng. ~ho 
is described by Issociates as 
frail, has reponedly been kept 
under virtual house mat, with 
tight police surveillance. 

But It midnight last 
Thursday, close to 60 security 
agents surrounckd the bishop's 
hoUie, entered it and seized him, 
said Joseph Kung, head of the 
Cardinal Kung Foundation in 
Stamford, Conn., which publi-
cizes the persecution of China's 
so-called underground church. 

Kung said in an interview that 
Zeng's associates had not yet 
been told why he was taken in. 
But Kung speculated that it was 
because of his continued intran-

si~ent stand against ceoperating 
WIth the goveJ;nment-allied 
church. His foundation has 
reported the detentions or beat-
in,s of several other pro-Vatican 
pnests in the last few months. 

The IITCSt repon coincided 
with the publicized visit to 
China by I high Vltican official. 
Cardinal Roser Etchegarly's 

I~ndance at a religious confer-
ence in Beijloa last week .hld 
been wicIt:l.Y Interpreted as indi-
cating I slaght thaw in relltions 
between China and the Vatican. 

Since he wu ordained as a 
priest in 1949, the yelr the 
Communists won power in 
China, Zeng has been one of the 
most steadfast opponents of the 
ofticial-pattioUc· church, which 
accepts the supremacy of the 
Communist Pany Ind. rejects 
the pope's right to select bish-
ops. Between 1955 and 1995, 
according to the Kung 
FO'lndation, he spent over 30 
years in prison.

u.s. Praises Move by Peftlvian Prelid8ld for New Elections 
WASHINGTON - The United 

States on Sunday welcomed the 
sudden decision on Saturday night 
by Peru's president. Alberto 
Fujimori. to call new elections and 
not to run in them himself. But 
American officials, who said the 
Clinton administration had been 
taken by surprise, expressed uncer-
tainty about what action the influen-
tial Peruvian army might take. 

In his decade in office. Fujimori 
has served Washington as a useful 
ally in its war agains,t drugs. But he 
became tangled in a mountmg cor-
ruption scandal and, since his dis-
puted re~lection in May to a third 
five-year term, had faced increasing 

pressure from the United States and 
the Organization of American States 
to enact democratic reforms. 

While he said in his dramatic 
television broadcast on Saturday 
night that he would call new elec-
tions immediately, he did not specify 
when they would be held. 

The most likely scenario seemed 
to be that elections would take six 
months 10 organize and that 
Fujimori would remain president 
until then, the secretary-general of 
the O~! ~r Gaviria, said Sunday. 

I n the 24 hours Ifter the presi-
dent's announcement, the army - a 
traditional power broker in Pma -
showed no signs of moving against 

Fujimori, and then were no stal£-
ments from the powerful inl£lIi-
gence chid. Vladirniro Montesinos. 
whose agency Fujimori said he TillS 
"deactivatin$-•. 

But semor army officers are 
believed to be on the side of 
MontesinO$, Fujimori's right-hand 
man, whose future began to appear 
in doubt after he was shown on a 
tape on Pmavian television last week 
apparently bribing an opposition 
F."Y member to switch to · the pres-
ident's party. 

The OAS had previously caIIcd 
for Fujimori to fire Montainol and 
on Saturdly demanclcd -quick and 
severe· action. In his ltartIin& 

~ce just houn later, Fujimori 
said he hoped the new election 
would satisCy the inlm1ltional com-
muni". 

Fujimori won his latest. third , 
five-year term in a runoff election in' 
May thlt wu boycotted by the 
opposition candidate, Alejandro 
Toledo. Ind condemned interna-
tionally as flawed. Of all the 
American stites, the United States 
was most vociferous in aiticizin 
the election. Since then, it ha~ 
seemed more or las reconciled to 

r-+i~ tt!' 6:~ 
encout'9 raorms that would soft-
en the FWvian Ieada't authoritari-

an style. 
Thousands of people poured 

onto the streets of Lima in jubilation 
early Sunday to celebrate Fujimori's 
promised depanure from office. 

Fujimori's decision to step down 
Ippears to haw: been sparked by the 
public liring of the embarrassing 
tape of Montcsinos. Fujimori, 62, is 
the longest-standing elected leader 
in Latin America. But following the 
widely disputed elections in May, his 
inaugurauon in July was marred by 
riots, arson, the deaths of six people 
Ind the arrests of 172.

of a canyon? Curiosity made us stop by this 
restaurant. There we indulged in tasty Asian 
entrees, calzone and stromboli specials, and 
grilled sandwiches. Decided to sit outside for 
a change. Best decision made all day. 

The worst day of my life. Milk went sour this 
morning. Forgot to buy a card for my mother's 
birthday. Needed to buy vitamins for my 
roommate. So much to do, so little time. Stress. 
Lots of stress. Talked to my friend Earl about 
it. He understood completely. A man with

Cannabis Comes to UCSD 
The Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research will establish its 
headquarters on campus to' study medical use of marijuana 
By ALEX J. LEE 
Associate News Editor 

The University of California 
announced on Aug. 29 that it 
would establish a new study cen-
ter in an attempt to determine 
the safety and efficacy of medici-
nal cannabis to treat certain dis-
eases. 

With its headquarters at 
UCSD, the Center for Medicinal 
Cannabis Research will be a joint 
collaboration with UCSF. anoth-
er leading biomedical research 
campus of the UC system. 

The state-funded CMCR will 
gather scientific data to help 
counties craft appropriate gUide-
lines for the pharmaceutical use 
of medicinal cannabis. 

The statewide, state-funded 
initiative will include researchers, 
doctors and patients throughout 
California. 

Such use has been approved 
since medicinal marijuana's 
decriminalization by a 1996 bal-
lot initiative adopted by 
California voters. Based on sug-
gestions made by early research 
and anecdotal evidence, the 
CMCR will concentrate on the 
beneficial uses of cannabis for 
treatment of such diseases and 
conditions such as cancer, multi-
ple sclerosis and AIDS. 

Although cannabis has helped 
relieve the suffering of many 
patients when other remedies 
have failed, scientific research 
has been limited, officials say. 

According to Igor Grant, a 
professor of psychiatry at UCSD 
and director of the CMCR, the 

precise role marijuana plays in 
patient care and how it should be 
administered as a pharmaceutical 
agent is still ambiguous. 

"Without reliable, substantial 
information about marijuana, it 
is doubtful that any progress will 
be made [in resolving the contro-
versy]: Grant said. 

Funding for the CMCR has 
been made possible by legislation 
passed by the state legislature 
signed into law by Gov. Gray 
Davis in October 1999. The leg-
islation calls for a three-year pro-
gram overseeing objective, high-
quality medical .. esearch that will 
enhance understanding of the 
potency and adverse effects of 
marijuana as a pharmacological 
agent, stressing that the project 
should not be construed as 
encouraging or sanctioning the 
social or recreational use of mar-
ijuana. 

$3 million has been provided 
by the state, under a bill spon-
sored by Sen. John Vasconcellos, 
D-Santa Clara. Millions more are 
expected to come from federal 
grants as other UC campus 
researchers start applying. 

UCSF oncologist and A[DS 
expert. Donald Abrams lauded 
the creation of the cannabis 
study center. 

"This is an important oppor-
tunity to continue to evaluate the 
therapeutic potential of 
cannabis: Abrams said . "The 
findings from our initial safety 
trial suggest that studies of the 
possible effectiveness of marijua-
na should be launched now. This 
state funding will allow that to 

happen quickly so that we may 
finally get some needed 
answers." 

This fall, the CMCR plans to 
solicit applications to be 
reviewed by an independent sci-
entific review board of national 
experts. According to Grant, 
funding will be awarded to sup-
port research focusing on dis-
eases and conditions as defined 
in a report by a National 
Institutes of Health expert panel, 
and the National Academy of 
Sciences/Institute of Medicine. 

"The politics of medical mari-
juana are behind us as we begin 
the important work of research-
ing the safety 'and efficacy of 
medical marijuana: 
Vasconcellos said. "The National 
Institutes of Health and the 
Institute of Medicine of the 
National Academy of Sciences 
have independently called for 
further studies. Now, because of 
the vision of the Legislature, the 
Governor and the University of 
California, the issue of medical 
marijuana is properly in the 
hands of physicians and 
researchers." 

Studies are anticipated to 
begin as early as January of next 
year, with support being awarded 
on a competitive basis to those 
studies deemed to be of the high-
est scientific quality. Grant 
believes most of the studies will 
be patient trials, though interest 
in funding basic research with 
direct relevance to understand-
ing the safety, potency, and

Ground Broken For Powell-
Focht Bioengineering Hall 
Chancellor Dynes presided over ceremony for new building that 
will house science research and teaching facilities 
" JINNIFIR lPOSITO 
Senior Staff Writer 

Ground was broken for 
the new Powell-Focht 
Bioengineering Hall during a 
ceremony presided over by 
Chancellor Robert Dynes last 
August. 

The ceremony, which 
took place at Warren col-
lege'S Pryate1 Field, included 
guest speakers from the 
National Institutes of Health, 
the' b,ioengineering depart-
ment at UCSD, and the 
Whitaker and Powell 
Foundations, two organiza-
tions whose grants will fund 
the construction of the $34 
million building. 

The five-story structure is 
designed to be a place to 
bring together the efforts of 
researchers and educators in 
the bioengineering depart-
ment. 

It _will house facilities for 
research, teaching and col-
laboration between scientists 
in interdisciplinary fields, 
along with a biomedical engi-
neenng library. 

The building is named in 
honor of the Charles Lee 
Powell Foundation and the 
late James L. Focht, a San 
Diego Superior Court judge. 

[n his opening remarks to 
the audience, many of which 
were members of the bio-
engineering faculty and 
research community, Dynes 

emphasized the effects that 
bringing together many 
resources would have on the 
quality of research on cam-
pus, in and out of the bio-
engineering department. 

"You're going to see a new 
form of research on this cam-
pus, and bioengineering will 
be at the heart of it: Dynes 
said. 

The Powell-Focht 
Bioengineering Hall will be

new form of research 
on this campus, and 
bioengineering will

unique among campus 
buildings, as it is the first to 
be funded entirely by private 
donations. 

In 1998, the bioengineer-
ing department was awarded 
the Whitaker Foundation's 
Leadership Award, a grant of 
$18 million. An $8 million 
gift from the Charles Lee 
Powell Foundation, along 
with the gifts of other private 
organizations and individuals 
rounded out funding for the 
structure. 

[n recognition of its con-
tribution toward the Powell-

Focht Bioengineering Hall, 
UCSD Foundation Trustee 
Duane Roth presented the 
Whitaker Foundation'S G. 
Burtt Holmes with the Civis 
Universitatis Award. 

The award, the title of 
which is Latin for "citizen of 
the university: recognizes 
outstanding contributions 
made to the university. 

Robert Conn, dean of the 
Jacobs School of 
Engineering, closed the cer-
emony with praise for the 
ingenuity of UCSD students 
and faculty. He attributed 
the bioengineering depart-
ment's steilar national rank-
ing to the uniqueness of its 
researchers' methodology. 

"We really are choosing 
the road less traveled by, and 
it's making all the differ-
ence: said Conn, alluding to 
the poetry of Robert Frost. 

To conclude the ceremo-
ny, organizers distributed T-
shirts to all attendees and 
directed them to stand on 
specially marked areas of 
Pryatel Field, 'forming a "living 
blueprint" of the building. 

Dynes and the other 
speakers posed in the middle 
of the human boundary to 
perform the ground breaking 
ceremony, while an aerial 
photographer captured the 
event. 

Construction is sched-
uled to be completed by 
2002. 

Renowned 
Scripps Director 
Passes Away 
Physicist brought prominence to 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography 

By LAURIN L COARINEY 
News Editor 

William Aaron Nierenberg. director of 
the Scripps [nstitutipn of Oceanography 
from 1965 to 1986, died Sept. 10 of can-
cer. He was 81. 

Nierenberg came to UCSD in 1965 
and began what would be the longest 
tenure of any of the Scripps Institution's 
nine directors. 

While there, he made it his goal to take 
on one new project each year. Some of 
these projects included the North Pacific 
experiment, which examined the effects of 
the air-ocean surface on short term cli-
mactic changes; deep sea drilling to con-
firm earthquake theories involving plate 
tectonics; a remote user access center for 
the San Diego Super Computer; and what 
some say Nierenberg felt to be his greatest 
-achievement, the placement of computers 
on ships. 

"With all of the things he did here, he 
provided leadership: said Associate 
Chancellor of Marine Science Tom 
Collins. "He was also a good fund-raiser 
and he benefited Scripps by being a true 
statesman of science. " 

According to Collins, Nierenberg was 
a man who knew what he wanted. 

"He had a very brilliant mind and it 
worked a mile a minute." said Collins, 
who felt Nierenberg had been like a father 
to him. "He thought quickly on his feet 
and you ha.d to be on your toes all the 
time, too. He didn't hesitate to express his 

feel ings." 
"The impact of Bill Nierenberg'S two 

decades of academic and scienrific leader-
ship at Scripps and UCSD is immeasur-
able: stated UCSD Chancellor Robert 
Dynes in a September press release. "His 
passion and enthusiasm for science and 
the institution have helped Scripps and 
UCSD achieve their prominence." 

Nierenberg held many posts outside 
Scripps and UCSD, including his service 
on several panels of the Presidenr's 
Science Advisory Committee. He was also 
a member of the National Science Board 
and secretary general for scientific affairs 
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
in Paris. 

[n his retirement, Nierenberg contin-
ued to study and write about science, 
including a biography about oceanogra-
pher Herald Sverdrup. 

Among the numerous awards 
Nierenberg received during his career 
were the Golden Dolphin Award of the 
Association Artistico Letteraria 
[nternazionale of Florence, Italy, the 
Compass. Award of the Marine 
Technology Society and NASA's 
Distinguished Public Service Medal. 

Nierenberg is survived by his wife 
Edith, daughter Victoria and son 
Nicholas. The family hopes to establish a 
foundation to suppOrt the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography. For more 
information, call the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography Development Office at

UCSD Ranks Seventh Out of Public Colleges 
u.s. News and World Report release findings indicating UCSD to be ''youngest of the best" 
By MAn SCHRADER 
Associate News Editor 

For the second consecutive 
year. the UCSD ranks as the sev-
enth-best public school in the 
country as reported Sept. 1 by 
U.S. News and World RepoH. 

The magazine also ranked 
UCS D as the 31 st-best national 
university in the country overall. 
up one position from last year. 

Though he believes the 
school deserves a higher ranking, 
Vice Chancellor James Langley is 
satisfied with the ranking, given 
the school's age and its perfor-
mance compared to schools that 
placed higher. UCSD is the 
youngest of any of the top-rank-
ing public schools by over 41 
years. 

"It used to be said of UCSD 
that it was the best of the young 
universities," he said. "It would 
be more accurate to say now that 
we are the youngest of the best." 

A.S. President Doc Khaleghi 
agreed . 

"It's great that such a young 
university ranks so highly," he 
said. "It shows that UCSD is one 
of the greatest educations per 

cost of attendance in the nation." 
Langley said he believes the 

school has compensated for .its 
young age through its ability to 
use all of its resources properly. 

"Even though I think UCSD 
is even better than the ranking, 
its national ranking may consti-

technology are considered to be 
the best of any public university 
in the nation ." 

In addition, the report ranked 
UCSD 22nd in total representa-
tion of ethnic and racial groul?s 
on campus. However, Langley IS 
not .content with this ranking, as 

he would like to tute the most 
remarkable story 
in higher educa-
tion," he said . 
"No other uni-
versity has come 
so far so fast. 
Even more 
remarkable is the 
fact that UCSD 
has transcended 
universities with 
far greater 
resources and 
more deeply 
entrenched repu-

university without a 
major athletic 
program, we don't 
have the visibility of 
some of those other

incorporate 
more ethnic 
groups into the 
school. 

" T hat 
sounds good. 
but we are not 
satisfied," he 
said . "Our 
Mexican-
American and 
Native-

-Vice Chancellor ....... A mer i can 

tations." 
Khaleghi attributes the suc-

cessful ranking to additional fac-
tors. 

"The beauty of our campus is 
unparalleled, and the opportuni-
ties this campus offers are limit-
less," he said. "The faculty is 
incredible, and our research and 

Lltn&ley enrollments are 
some of the 

worst in the UC system. We can't 
hide behind that ranking. We 
must do better." 

Langley cites this goal as one 
of many that will help the school 
in obtaining a higher ranking. 

"If we can continue to 
improve and better communicate 
our screngths, our reputation will 

continue to grow," Langley said. 
"Keep in mind that these rank-
ings are driven largely by reputa-
tion . As a young university with-
out a major athletic program, we 
don't have the visibility of some 
of these other schools." 

UCSD lacks some of the fun -
damental factors that go into 
building a school's reputation , 
such as age and a major sports 
program. 

Alumni support is currently 
200th in the nation at 7 percent. 

Alumni support is one of the 
categories Us. News and World 
Report uses to determine the 
rankings. 

Khaleghi suggests the lack of 
support is due to a lack of com-
munity evident on campus. 

The Fiske campus profile of 
UCSD states that "the Univj!rsity 
is dry, so most of the real social-
izing seems to take place off cam-
pus. The students of UCSD are 
exceptionally serious." 

To rid this perception, 
Khaleghi believes that UCSD 
needs to develop a greater on-
campus social life.

A.S. Attenipts~ to Alleviate Campus Concerns 
Council takes on parking, transportation, housing and sense of community with expectations of improvement 
By MAn SCHRADER 
Associate News Editor 

With the start of another 
school year, the A.S. Council 
attempted to take steps to rid 
UCSD of the parking, housing 
and community problems that 
students face on campus. 

"Through the year, my central 
goal is to make student life on this 
campus easier, in any way possi-
ble. from housing, to parking, to 
fees, etc.," said A.S. President Doc 
Khaleghi. "My last main goal is to 
help promote the UCSD commu-
nity." 

Of immediate concern to most 
students is the lack of parking 
available on school grounds. 
Parking permits, which currently 
cost $342 per year, are being sold 
now. Khaleghi believes that 98 
percent of all parking spots will be 
filled on_any given day during the 
new school year. 

"Ninety-eight percent is not as 
bad as a few years ago, but the 
problem is still pretty bad," he 
said. 

In order to alleviate such prob-
lems, Khaleghi has been working 
with the UCSD Parking and 
Transportation Committee this 
summer in an attempt to increase 
parking on campus. 

Despite the increase in price of 
the permits from $108 to $114 per 
quarter, students were initially 
expected to get an extra 79 spots 
created by the two new parking 
structures, one located along 
North Torrey Pines Road near 
Marshall college and the other at 
Gilman Drive and Russell Lane. 
However, due to the construction 
of the new Eleanor Roosevelt 

College, 300 parking spots will be 
taken away. 

Marshall sophomore Manson 
Huie said he believes the addition-
al spots will help, but are not the 
answer that students are looking 
for. 

"After all this construction and 
inconvenience, I can't believe that 
the students are only getting a 
limited number of more spots," he 
said . "The notion of building 
these structures was good, but it 
certainly doesn't solve any of the 
much larger parking problems 
that exist." 

To end such a debate, the 
transportation Committee agreed 
to convert 48 spots from green 
spaces to yellow in North Parking 
to try to decrease the problem. 

"This was a big success for the 
A.S.," Khaleghi said. "This was the 
fn-st time in A.S. history that we 
have gotten spaces we lobbied 
for." 

In addition, the ~.S. Council 
and the Parking and 
Transportation Committee have 
agreed to double the shuttle ser-
vice around campus between 2 
p.m. and 4 p.m., lines are the 
longest. 

The city of San Diego, UCSD 
and the UC Regents are also in the 
process of building a trolley sta-
tion near campus. Currently, four 
possible areas near campus -
Gilman Drive. Pepper Canyon and 
two sites east of Highway 5 - are 
being debated for the location of 
the trolley stop. 

"We need another form of 
transportation so that students 
will get out of their cars,· Khaleghi 
said. "This will hopefully help the 
parking problem." 

Khaleghi hopes the station will 
be built on Gilman Drive, as it 
would prevent students from hav-
ing to take a shuttle from the trol-
ley station to the center of cam-
pus. 

"If people have the choice 
'between taking the trOlley and 
then taking a shuttle or taking 
their car and then taking a shuttle, 
they are going to choose to take 
their car," Khaleghi said. "There is 
a lot more flexibility with a car." 

Students without cars also have 
an interest in bringing the trolley 
on campus as it would allow them 
to travel around the San Diego 
area more efficiently and faster. 

"S ince I don't plan on having a 
car on campus, this would allow 
me to do everything I would want 
to do without having to rely on 
other people," said Roosevelt 
freshman Ali Noble. "It would 
certainly be easier than the bus." 

Parking is one of a few prob-
lems that the A.S. Council has 
attempted to fix this summer. The 
council has also been working 
with Off-Campus Housing to try 
to increase the number of listings 
that are advertised at school. 

"Trying to find a place off cam-
pus was literally impossible,· said 
Muir senior Nate Rossi . "I wish 
the off-campus housing office 
had been a bigger help to me.· 

As a result of the lack of list-
ings, Khaleghi said available 
apartments are rare and over-
priced. "There is a lot of competi-
tion for the places, and that drives 
the prices up." he said. "They can 
charge what they want." 

Over the summer, the Off-
Campus Housing Office tried to 
increase its number of listings to 

prevent problems such as these 
from occurring. 

"We needed to increase adver-
tising off campus so more people 
know to list [their apartments] on 
campus," Khaleghi said. "We are 
going to put a lot of money into 
publicity so that people know we 
are out there." 

Currently, student~ looking for 
apartments in the vicinity of 
UCSD must look for listings in 
other publications, such as the 
San Diego Union Tribune. However. 
many students have found that 
the landlords listed in these pub-
lications are not willing to rent to 
students. 

"Most people advertising in 
real newspapers don't want stu-
dents living in their places." Huie 
said. "It's not as though we're 
going to get their places capped 
by the police for excessive noise. ~ 

The increase in listings at the 
Off-Campus Housing Office will 
help alleviate such problems, as 
only those landlords who are 
willing to rent to college students 
will list their apartments at 
school. 

"The occupancy rate in La 
Jolla is over 99 percent: said 
Muir sophomore Sabrina Loer. 
"We as students need all the help 
we can get: 

Khaleghi believes that even 
with the struggle of trying to find 
a parking space and housing in 
the area, many students are prone 
to leaving campus during school 
functions and athletic events. as 
there is little sense of community 
evident on campus. 

"We have a five-college system 
and we are individualized in 
terms of our commencement. our 

electives and a lot of other 
things," he said . "We need to 
build a sense of community to 
join everyone together." 

Director of Athletic Relations 
Matt DeFord and Khaleghi have 
met this summer in an attempt to 
increase participation anct atten -
dance. at sporting events. "We are 
going to have a lot of sports ral-
lies this year and give away a lot 
of items at the games. and for the 
first time, the A.S. Council is 
sponsoring a mascot." Khaleghi 
said . 

The school is planning to 
throw a tailgate party at San 
Diego State University and spon-
sor a Midnight Madness 
Basketball game. in addition to 
handing ou t free souvenirs at 
home games. 

. Through the increase of stu-
dent activity at the games and the 
already highly attended program-
ming events, Khaleghi hopes to 
change the lasting impression 
students have of UCSD. 

"The long-term effects of this 
is that it gives people more of a 
memory of UCSD," he said . "We 
are trying to create an emotional 
tie to the school." 

Khaleghi sees alumni support 
as one sign that this is not hap-
pening. 

"The low alumni support of 7 
percent is one indication that 
these lasting memories have not 
been created thus far," Khaleghi 
said . "In the future, we are trying 
to change all of this to create this 
snowball effect. The more money 
we get from our alumni. the bet-
ter events we can plan, and the 
better the memories of UCSD we 
can create."

40th Anniversary Celebrated 
With Community Service 
Campus' birthday brings hopes of reaching out to 
members of the UCSD community 
By REBECCA WOOD 
Staff Writer 

The celebration of UCSD's 4{)th 
anniversary continues this fall with a 
series of events highlighting the uni-
versity'S achievements, faculty, stu-
dents and community outreach 
endeavors. 

Community Day will be held Oct. 
28. where the community will be 
invited to open-house exhibits and 
programs, and prospective students 
and their parents can attend Preview 
Day programs that will introduce 
UCSD to prospective students. 
Alumni will also participate in home-
coming activities. 

On Nov. 17, UCSD's anniversary 
will be celebrated with a reception 
that will honor faculty, students and 
staff who serve as community volun-
teers. 

Also in the fall, oW "gifts" of com-
munity service will be a focus of the 
celebration. Chancellor Robert 
Dynes will meet with leaders from 
various community centers in five 
areas of San Diego, which include 
metropolitan San Diego, the South 
Bay, East County, North County 
Inland and North County Coastal. 

He will publicly distribute direc-
tories that will list more than 300 
UCSD services. The directories will 
also be available as inserts in local 
newspapers. 

One of the UCSD services to be 
recognized is Active Students for 
Kids, a program of the Volunteer 
Connection. 

A.5.K. provides mentoring ser-
vices and responds to the challenges 
of poverty, illiteracy and cultural 
diversity to assist children in kinder-
garten through fifth grade at Toler 
and Baypark elementary schools. 

Its programs include one-on-one 
tutoring. classroom aid and after-
school projects. All the projects 
depend upon UCSD students who 
commit to serve two hours per week 
for a quarter. 

Assistant Director of Student 
Activities and Government Randy 
Woodard said that every year the 
program has 30 to oW UCSD stu-

Collegiate: 
94 percent of freshmen 
return for a sewnd year 
c.tII ••• d ..... ..... A1 
olds voted in the 1998 mid-term 
elections. 

ASUM has encouraged MU 
voter registration for 25 years. 
However, this year, the group will 
not be alone in its efforts, ASUM 
Executive Director Mary Anne 
McCollum said. 

"Different organizations, as well 
as ASUM, are all going to be work-
ing together to have tables on cam-
pus so that students won't have to 
go very far if they are not regis-
tered; McCollum said. 

Some designated registration 
sites include the Black Culture 
Center, the Multicultural Center, 
residence halls and Greek houses. 
Those locations have voter regis-
tration applications available, 
McCollum said. 

Yet the turnout for young voters 
in November is still questionable. 
In the previous presidential elec-
tion, only one-third of 18- to 24-
year-olds cast a vote. 

"I think most people don't 
think that every vote counts." MU 
senior Zara Patel said. "Even if 
they do think that their vote 
counts, they don't like the people 
who are running, and they don't 
want to vote." 

One complaint from young 
constituer,ts has been the lack of 
politicians who are addressing the 

dents. According to Woodard, many 
of the children in the program come 
from economically disadvantaged 
homes and need the support of a role 
model outside of their immediate 
family. 

"UCSD students are role models 
and encourage them and show them 
how important education is," said 
Woodard, adding that the student-
volunteers often give the children 
tours of UCSD. "They try to show 
them there's more to life than what 
they are faced with." 

Another organization that pro-
vides service to the community is 
Alpha Phi Omega, a national co-ed 
service fraternity. Its members volun-
teer their time for a total of over 
1,000 hours per quarter. 

According to Dynes, the anniver-
sary activities are meant "to celebrate 
UCSD's accomplishments. to cele-
brate: service to the community, to 
demonstrate UCSD's gratitude for 
community support. and to demon-
strate UCSD's recomJllitment to 
outreach and service." 

The kick-off of a series of events 
to celebrate UCSD's 4{)th anniver-
sary began with the Alumni 
Association's "Proud to be oW" 
Awards for Excellence Gala held last 
June. The ceremony ir\Cluded a mul-
timedia presentation honoring oW 
outstanding alumni and students for 
their achievements and contribu-
tions to the community. 

Some of the people honored 
were Captain Eleanor Mariano, 
who is the Director of the White 
House Medical Unit and physician 
to the president; Rusty 
Preisendorfer, the founder of Rusty 
Cos. Surfboard and Beach Apparel; 
Steve Peace, California State 
Senator of the 40th Senate District; 
and Abby Leibman, founder and 
executive director of the California 
Women's Law Center. 

The UCSD campus was estab-
lished by the Board of Regents on 
Nov. 18, 1960. It was originally 
founded on an abandoned World 
War" army base overlooking the 
ocean. Its first undergraduate 
class had 181 students. 

youth of the country. 
Sophomore Kelly Levick said 

the politicians themselves are to 
blame for the political apathy of 
young people. 

"I think they should probably 
try do more to catch the attention 
of younger people; Levick said. 

Levick said she was ill-informed 
on the candidates' issues. 

"I don't think I'm going to 
vote: Levick said. "If I could make 
an educated vote. I would, but I 
can't. I think it's just better if I 
don't vote rather than vote and not 
know anything about it: 

Chancellor Richard Wallace said 
the candidates have trouble relat-
ing to youth because of one factor. 

"I think the reason is in the sta-
tistics: Not many of them vote; 
Wallace said. "And if we: could tum 
that around, then the candidates 
will come to where the votes are." 

Both presidential Democratic 
nominee AI Gore and Republican 
nominee George W. Bush are mak-
ing an effort to reach young voters, 
campaign officials said. 

"The youth vote is extremely 
important to us; Zaroulis said. 

Gus Wagner, chairman of the 
Missouri Federation of Young 
Republicans, said his group is 
sending out information about 
Republican candidates specifically 
targeted to young voters. 

"We are all asking, 'What more 
can be done to get you motivated 
to go out and vote?'" McCollum 
said. "And I think only you can 
answer that."

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO 
TRANSPORTATION AND PARKING SERVICES 

GILMAN PARKING STRUCfURE OPENS! 
The Gilman Drive Parking Structure will open September 18, 2000. The parking allocation in this facility is 180 "A" faculty spaces, 159 

"B" staff spaces, 311 "S" student spaces, 171 meter/visitor spaces, 20 Credit Union spaces, and 17 spaces accessible for people with disabilities. 
On the west facade of the structure, a new Campus Parking Office, which will consolidate all parking sales, ridesharing, and citation adjudication services, 

will open in Win tel 200 I . On the south facade, the USE Credit Union will open their new facilities later in the 2000/200 I academic year. 

NORTH TORREY. PINES STRUCTURE DELAYED 
Due to construction delays, the North Torrey Pines Road Structure is now planned for a 
winter 200 I opening. The parking allocation of this facility will be 180 "A" faculty spaces, 
300 "B" staff spaces, 370 "S" student spaces, 91 meter/visitor spaces, and 20 spaces 
accessible for people with disabilities. There will be two entrances to the facility; how-
ever, the eastern entrance will be unavailable until the ERC construction project has been 
completed in 2002. All traffic will enter and exit from the southern entrance for the first 
two years of operation. 

PARKING RE-ALLOCATION FOR FALL 2000 
Two new major construction projects at UCSD, the Natural Sciences Building project on 
Revelle Campus, and the Eleanor Roosevelt College (ERC) project on the north campus, 
will begin this fall. As a result, Transportation and 
Parking Services has made major parking re-alloca-
tions to provide tlle parking that these projects will 
displace. 

UCSD SHUITLE Bus SYSTEM ROUTE CHANGES 
Due to major campus construction projects and the resultant road closures, the UCSD 
Shuttle System will be making some substantial route changes, effective Fall 2000. 

With the elimination of a major portion of the parking on the north campus and the closure 
of the Campus Loop Road adjacent to the ERC construction, the North Parking Shuttle 
will provide service from parking Lot P356 to the Geisel Library at Hopkins Lane via 
Hopkins Drive. This service will operate from 7:00 a.m. to 12: 15 a.m., Monday through 
Friday, beginning Monday, September 18, 2000. 

As an added security measure, a shuttle van will provide direct service from Lot P356 to 
the Thurgood Marshall College housing areas from 10:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m., Sunday through 
Thursday, until the North Torrey Pines Road Structure opens. 

The Campus Loop Shuttle will also be af-

The first stage of the ERC co~struction will begin 
mid-September 2000 and will require the permanent 
closure of parking Lots P305, P306, P353, and a por-
tion ofP355. Unfortunately, due to construction de-
lays, the North Torrey Pines Road Parking Structure 
is not scheduled to open until Winter Quarter 200 I. 
This will result in a major loss of parking on the north 
campus for the Fall Quarter 2000.

fected. With the closure of Scholars Drive 
North, the Campus Loop shuttle will be 
diverted-from the north campus and re-
routed onto Thurgood Marshall Lane and 
Voigt Lane. The shuttle. will cross Ridge 
Walk as part of this new route, providing 
faster, more convenient service for pas-
sengers. This service will operate from 
7:00 a.m.- 12 : 15 a.m., Monday through 
Friday, beginning on Monday, Sept. 18th. 

[n order to accommodate faculty and staff in the area 
during this time, parking Lot P351 will be converted 
to "An faculty parking and a ponion of parking Lot 
P357 will be converted to "8" staff parking. 1,191 
"S" student spaces will remain on the north campus 
for use in the fall. 

In addition to the loss of parking in this area, a por-
tion of Scholars Drive North will be closed between 
the entrance to Lot P351 on the north, and Thurgood 
Marshall Lane on the south. This section of the Cam-
pus Loop Road will be closed from mid-September 
2000 until the fall of 2002. 

Also, Salk Institute Road, between North Torrey 
Pines Road and Scholars Drive North, will be per-
manently closed in mid September 2000. A new road, 
providing access from North Torrey Pines Road to 
the new parking structure, will open in conjunction 
with the structure in Winter Quarter 200 I . 
During mid-October 200Q, the Natural Science 
Building project will begin construction and require 
the permanent closure of Lot PI 0 I. This will result 
in a major loss of parking in the Revelle College area 
for the fall of 2000. 

In order to accommodate faculty and staff in this area, 
parking Lot PI 04 will be converted to "An faculty 
parking. Lot PI03, along with a portion of Lot PI02, 
will be converted to "B" staff parking. 243 "S" stu-
dent spaces will remain in Lot PI 02 during Fall Quar-
ter 2000. 

NEW ALTERNATE SCHEDULE 
PARKING PERMIT 

The UCSD Transportation Policy Committee, at their 
July 2000 meeting, approved a new Alternate 
Schedule parking permit for "S" student parking 
spaces. This permit option was recommended by the 
Associated Students to provide reduced-cost park.ing 
permits for those with alternate schedules. This 
quarterly permit will be sold on a. trial basis , 
beginning FaJl 2.000, through the end of Spring 
Quarter 200 I. The permit will allow parking on either 
(I) Monday/Wednesday/Friday or (2) Tuesday/ 
Thursday/Friday, throughout a given quarter. 

The permit will sell for S70,yhich i.approximately 
60% of the quarterly rate for an annual "S" pennit. 
This new permit will be ~vailable for purchase at 
the Campus Parking Office. For more information, 
please contact the Parking Office at (858) 534-4223.

Move: 
Triton 1TUJVe to Div. II 
means new faces, foes 
CoatIIIIied ,..... pep AM 
national championships. 

The move to Division 1\ was a 
long time coming. In 1991 , the 
Intercollegiate and Recreational 
Athletics Advisory Committee 
met to discuss .the pOSSibility of 
t~e mov~. Th~ ~Ime was not right, 
WIth Cahforma s economy not in 
the best of shape, so the decision 
was moved back. 

In 1997 3' student referendum 
passed with 87 percent of the vot-
ers in favor of a move to Division 
II. The next year, Chancellor 
Robert Dynes sent a letter to the 
NCAA, making the move official 
and beginning a two-year transi-
tion period. 

UCSD even has a public rela-
tions campaign called "Division II 
2000· accompanying it's move up. 

"It's to get the word out and 
have people understand that we 
have made a change, and hopeful-
ly educate -a little more in wha t 
Division 1\ competition really 
means,· Edwards said. 
. D,espite an increasing empha-

SIS on athletics, UCSD academics 
will by no means be lost in the 
shuffle. The excellence UCSD 
holds -in the classroom - this 
fall's incoming freshmen have an 
average GPA of over 4.0 - will 
continue to be stressed. 

"When we talk about recruit-
ing the student athlete, one thing 
that clearly helps ~s is the combi-
nation of academIC and athletic 
excellence, and we'll continue our 
tradition as far as the academic 
side is concerned: Edwards said. 
"We'll always recruit the students' 
that can be successful here at 
UCSD: 

x-country: 
Nielsen injury means 
someone must step up 
CoIItInIIed rr- ..... AU 
working hard this preseason and 
are. lookin~ for long-term gratifi-
cation, whIch would be a champi-
onship title, and this meet $ave us 
the opportunity to identify what 
will get us to that point: 

An early tribulation, however, 
has already befallen the Triton 
squad, as standout returnee James 
Nielsen has suffered a season-
ending injury and will be declared 
a medical redshirt for the rest of 
the season. 

"James had an unfortunate 
accident that is going to preclude 
him from any competition in the 
cross country circuit this season, 
but he is a very tough individual, 
and he has already begun a thor-
ough and challenging rehab pro-
g~m that will hopefully have him 
back for track in the spring,· Van 
Arsdalc said. . 

The women's side sees many of 
its top competitors from last sea-
son and hopes to continue its 
winning ways. thanks especially to 
the efforts of team captain Amy 
Wu, newcomer Mary Peate and 
sophomore Audrey Sund. 

Megan Scott, an All American 
in 1998, and Amy Kitchen, a com-
petitor at the national level in 
1997, will also be counted on to 
perform. 

Van Arsdale extols the virtues 
of his team captain. 

"None arC more committed to 
cross country than Amy. She 
always excels, regardless of the 
course: he said. 

So when you groggily open 
your eyes while lurching to that ~ 
a.m. class after a ni~ht of heavy 
drinking spy some Thton runners 
striding gracefully around 
Campus Loop, first curse yourself 
for being such a lousy, worthless 
bum, then give props to the cross 
country crew and wish them luck 
in the coming season.

New and Old Faces to 
Carry Cross Country 
Returning competitors and Mary Peate are 
looking to lead women runners in 2000 
By scon BURROUGHS 
Staff Writer 

Fall quarter is upon us here 
in San Diego, though you cer-
tainly would not know it unless 
you had a calendar on hand for 
proof. 

While the weather seems to 
be under the impression that 
this is Saharan Africa, some tell-
tale signs of the encroachment 
of autum n can be seen around 
campus. The parking lots are 
full, the bookstore lines are long 
and the on-campus bar.s are 
swarmi ng with drunks flailing 
abou t in vain attempts to ward 
off the coming term. • 

Other sure signs that fall is 
here can be observed running 
diligently to and from all points 
on campus. The Triton cross 
country team ' is once again 
preparing for another arduous 
season, working hard to achieve 
an optimum performance level 
before the key meets are upon 
us. 

The team is lacing up its 
kicks for Division II, and all the 
niton runners, along with Head 
Coach Ted Van Arsdale, are 
eagerly anticipating the chal-
lenges they will be facing over 
the course of the season. 

MWe've got a lot of new talent 
out there: Van Arsdale said. 
"Everyone is making important 
strides in preparation for the 
season." 

Twenty-one runners' worth 
of talent will be competing this 
year for the Tritons, including 
three redshi rt freshmen. Van 
Arsdale has already been 
impressed by a few of these new 
Triton runners, especially Adam 
Miller. Grant Story and Neil 
Carras. 

"Miller definitely has the 
tools right out of high school to 
make an impact at the Division 
II level," Van Arsdale said . "Story 
has definitely stepped his perfor-
mance up over the summer, and 
Carras has also made tremen-
dous strides in the right direc-
tion . They will definitely factor 
into our success this season ." 

The Tritons have already 
delved into a couple of early-
season matches, hosting a meet 
that pitted the Tritons against 
runners from Point Loma 
Nazarene University, and partic-
ipating in the SDSU 
Invitational. 

The Tritons dispatched Point 
Loma handily, with scores of 38-
18 for the women and 38-20 for 
the men. 

The SDSU Invitational was 
more of a preparatory experi-
ence, allowing the Tritons to 
progress as a team. 

"The SDSU meet helped to 
indicate what we, as a team, need 
to do to be successful: Van 
Arsdale said. MWe have been

Men's Soccer Team to 
Rebound from Big Losses 
Half of the team departs, leaving a number of youngsters to take over 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

After losing about half its team to graduation and 
other circumstances, youth seems to be the theme 
for the 2000 UCSD men's soccer team. 

Youth, unfortunately, may not be the theme of 
choice heading into competitive Divis ion II play. So 
far, though, it is working out well for the Tritons. 

UCS D is currently 5-1, including a win in its first 
California Collegiate Athletic Association match up, a 
1-0 overtime conquest of Cal Poly Pamona. 

"That was a great win for us." said Triton Head 
Coach Derek Armstrong. "[t's a good barometer. We 
need a couple more wins to see where we are." 

The high quality of incoming freshmen is due to 
some excellent recruiting during the offseason. 

·We had a good year of recnliting," Armstrong 
said. "We have some good young players. It will pay 
dividends: 

Youth can mean inexperience, which is danger-
ous, but Armstrong sees some strong rookies that 
should overcome that pitfall. One such standout is 
Jonathan Shum. 

"It looks like he is going to be a player: 
Armstrong said. "There's a whole number of people.· 

Tho of the top returnees are Brady Bernard, 
Bobby Saadati and Derek Orchard. 

The goalkeeper position is in que~tion, but in a 
positive way. There are two capable shot-blockers 
vying for the starting spot. Sophomore Ryan Weirich 
came into the season penciled in as the starter but 
was injured during the preseason. Freshman jeremy 
Cookson has been getting the starts in the meantime, 
performing impressively while allowing only two' 
goals so far.

MHe's doing very well: Armstrong said. "I've got 
two goalkeepers fighting ' for the spot. Someone 
needs to step up. It's a healthy situation." 

Moving to Division II brings a different level of 
competition. and the Tritons will be facing many new 
teams for the first time. Armstrong sees no problem 
with that. 

The nitons are trying to improve on their 12-4-3 
record last year that saw them lose in the NCAA 
Regional playoffS against Trinity University of Texas 
in a shoot-out. . 

Mit adds a bit of spice," Armstrong said. MWe play 
here. we play away. We've got a number of double-
headers with the women's team. That's kind of nice. 
The status of the university is lifting and that lifts us 
up with it"

UCSD Women's Volleyball 
Head Coach 

A number of 
good players are 
making their 

return, including Leslie Punelli, 
Jamie Woods, Jessica Barter and 
Kathleen Hentz. 

Alas, this sea-
son is different. With UCSD's 
move to Division 11 competition 
comes tougher play and a new 
conference, the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association. 

Has lhis affected the Tritons? 
Not a bft. 

The 1ritons have been tearing 
through early-season opponents, 
sporting . a . 10-1 record . 
Conference play looks tough, but 
the nitons think they will hold 
their own. 

"It's going to be interesting:

body in the conference." 

In addition to the 10 returning

sion. 

MI think it's a safe prediction 
seeing as we're in Division II and

ence between the top four or five

Second, the coaches are not 
changing. These are the sa me 
coaches that helped bring the 
Tritons all of this glory. They are 
going to plot and motivate their 
players and find out some way to 
win. There is no worry there. 

If you have excellent players and 
excellent coaches - check, and 
check - the phrase "laughing 
stock" will not be part of the 
school's vocabulary. 

There are other sports that 
won't be affected by the move. 
Water polo already plays in an open 
division. The track, ~ross country 
and swimming squads already 
compete against Division I and 
Division 11 opponents and hold 
their own. 

I admit that, on the team level, it 
will be a while before the successes 
enjoyed by affected squads in 
Division 1/1 will be attained in 
Division II. Realistically, there will 
be no championships this year, no 
conference titles and likely no play-
off games. I hope they accomplish 
all of these things, but it is hard for 
any school to do so in its first year 
in Division II. 

But will these competitors fall 
on their faces? Will they go win -
less? Will they be a joke to the 
community? Certainly not. The 
UCSD Tritons can and will hold 
their own against any challenger.

Tritons Will 
Not Succumb 
to Pressure 

ROBERT FULTON 

W elcome back n:om your summer vacation. I hope all went well for every-
one. 

The new school year is upon 
us and, as a lways, the athletics 
teams have been going full throt-
tle for a couple of weeks now. The 
me n's and women's soccer 
squads, the cross ' country team, 
the men 's water polo team and the 
women's volleyball squad have 
already had a number of competi-
tions, in addition to the practices 
they have had to endure since 
August. 

The big news for th is year is 
tha t UCSD is moving from 
Division III to Division I!. It is 
kind of like moving from single-A 
to double-A baseball. The com-
petition is tougher, the schools 
bigger, meaning more talent. For 
those who don't exactly under-
stand, it's like moving from lower-
division classes' to upper-division 
ones. It 's JUSt plain harder and 
more work. More is expected of 
th e teams. 

Some out there believe, per-
haps rightfully so, that the move to 
Division II will spell disaster for 
the Tritons; that the home team 
here does not stand a chance. The 
other schools are just too good. 
The man with the fish tail and a 
trident in his hand doesn't stand a 
snowball's chance in hell . Well, I 
am here to say these people are 
wrong. 

The naysayers do have a valid 
point. For years, UCSD has been 
feeding off the likes of Point Lorna 
University and The Master's 
College. Now, large schools are on 
the agenda and there won't be a 
single gimme game. 

What's more, UCSD does not 
offer athletic scholarships to its 
stellar performers. Most other 
Division II schools do, or at least 
have some other system that, while 
it does not technically offer schol-
arships, serves the same purpose. 
It's hard to compete with programs 
offering to pay for top athletes' 
schooling. 

These all stand as hard evidence 
that the Tritons will fall on their 
faces, like many around claim, but I 
say it will not happen Iik.e that. 

The fine athletes of Triton ath-
letics are JUSt that - fine athletes. 
Don't forget, folks, there is champi-
onship blood running through the 
veins of these competitors. Last 
year the lritons brought home 
national championships in 
women's soccer and men's volley-
balL 

Are you going to tell me that 
these teams, which hoisted tro-
phies last year, and the others that 
saw playoff action or just plain had 
good seasons, are going to head to 
their respective fields and courts 
and forget how to play? No. These 
players aren't going to think, 
"Whoa, this is Division II , now 
where do I kick the ball? Coach, 
you say the ball goes through the 
hoop?" They are not going to do 
that . What they are going to do is 
work their butts off.

PORTS 
HELLO 

DIVISION II 
For years now, UCSD Athletics had been striving 
in Division III. Now, the. school is moving up. 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

Goodbye to the small schools and the 
easy wins. Hello to a whole new world. 

UCSD's athletics program is 
venturing into uncharted ter-

ritory with its move to 
Division II competition. 

The Tritons previous ly 
played their games in Division 

III, winning numerous champi-
onships. At this higher level of play, the com-
petition will be tougher. 

"Primari ly, it's the right thing for us to do 
right now with the growth of the institu-
tion," UCSD Director of Athletics Earl 
Edwards said. "We're at 19,000 and pre-

pared to go to 30,000 in the next few years. 
That's a much larger student population 
than most Division III schools have." 

The move includes another big change 
for UCSD. A long-time independent institu-
tion, the Tritons will become part of the 
Cali forn ia Collegiate Athletic Association . 

Being in a conference will make schedul-
ing much easier, with many dates on the cal-
endar filled with conference match ups. 

"That's always a major concern before 

Women's Soccer to 
Build on Title Ye'ar 
Youth on the defensive side and an injury to their 
starting goalkeeper raises questions this season 

Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's soccer 
team had the best preparation for 
this year's grueling Division II 
test. [t won a national champi-
onship last season. 

This year, the Tritons hope to 
build on last year's 19-1 -2 title-
winning season in this new land-
scape of Division n and the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association. 

The Tritons are bringing 
back 10 players from last year's 
dominant squad . They lost 
seven key members in the off-
season, four to the call of gradu-
ation . 

The toughness of playing in 
Division II has already reared its 
ugly head. 

"We think the returning back 
three should be strong, but we've 
given up five goals in three 
games," Head Coach Brian 
McManus said. "We've never 
done that before." 

Despite that, the Tritons cur-
rently sport a record of 4-1 

The Tritons will have no wor-
ries with the return of some of 

'Tts players. The likes of Laura 
Dooly, Jessica Cordova, 
Elizabeth Hughes, Ju lia Cuder, 
Cindy Dostalek, Lauren Jacobs, 
Christy Abizaid and Erika 

Alfredson should carry the team 
well . 

There are a number of young 
players, though, and it will take 
time for them to play at their 
elders' level. ... 

·Our strength would be the 
different parts coming together," 
McManus said. 

One area of concern is that of 
goalkeeper. The impenetrable 
Jennifer Hetland, who won three 
national titles while at UCSD, 
has graduated . Laura Dolkas 
was to take her place, but she 
sustained an injury over the 
summer. Freshman Carolyn 
Cadei took over the spot, but 
turned her ankle. Another fresh-
man, Maki Poma, is now pro-
tecting the net, and is doing fine 
so far. 

·She's doing quite well ," 
McManus said. ·We'll keep work-
ing with her, building her confi-
dence." 

The women's soccer team, 
which has grown used to winning 
titles, will have to work hard dur-
ing its inaugural year in Division 
n. 

"I think we'll be relatively suc-
cessful : McManus said. 
"Whether we'll make the confer-
ence playoffs will be a fight. The 
south is tough . We' ll all be up on 
each other. It's not going to be 
easy." 

you make a move, whether you're 
going to have a home or not," Edwards 
said. "That worked out well. " 

Divis ion II will be a whole new • 
scene for UCS D athletes in partcular. 

"W~ need to s,tep up the athletic 
competition to a Division II level : ' 
Edwards said . "The types of athletes 
coming to this school and those 
we'll be competing against will be 
much higher. Hopefully that will 
help to create a little more school 
spi rit, more people' coming out to 
see athletic competition at that 
level. 

This also puts us more in line with 
some of the other California schools 
thar are in the conference. That will 
eventually create some familiarity 
and some ri va lries that we haven 't 
had in the past." 

Remaining Division III schools 
are shedding no tears over UCSO's 
move. The Tritons won 27 team nation-
al championships against their former 
foes. They also had 33 runners-up, 31 
third-place and 90 individual

Newcomers, New 
Season for Water Polo 
"So far, so good" for team that lost 10 players 
from last year's squad, sports two qoalkeepers 
Sports Editor 

Last year, the UCSD men's 
water polo team battled its way to 
the NCAA Final Four, losing both 
games at home to finish the sea-
son 19-12. 

Despite the loss in the tourna-
ment, the team definitely has 
many of the tools it will need to 
get back to where it was last year, 
but it will have to work hard to 
make up for some of its off-sea-
son losses. 

The 'futons lost 10 players 
from last year's squad. 1\velve 
have returned. 

Perhaps their biggest loss was 
that of Ross Mecham, who grad-
uated. Mecham was the star of 
last year's tournam~nt-bound 
team, scoring S9 goals. 

Even with the key off-$Cason 
losses, this year appears very 
promising thus far. 

"So far, so good," said Head 
Coach Denny Harper. "No doubt 
about it, we have another strong 
team." 

The team is currently 7-2 after 
big wins at the UCSD Fins 
Invitational and victories against 
UC Berkeley and the University 
of the Pacific. 

"I'm pleased with where we 
are at this point; Harper said. 

Physical ability will not be a 

problem for these 1iitons. who 
have been working out to get into 
playing shape since August. 

·Certainly we have some size 
and some speed and some tal-
ent,W Harper said. "We have 
some new guys. We lost a lot of 
starters.W 

UCSD has always had a good 
defense. This year does not seem 
to be an exception. 

·It's tough to say at this 
point; Harper said. "lraditionally 
we have always fielded a strong 
defensive team. The offense will 
be improving.w . 

The goalkeeper situation is 
being run by committee. The time 
is being split between senior 
Glenn Busch -and sophomore 
Lance Onken. It is not yet decid-
ed whether this system will stay in 
place the whole year, or whether 
someone will step up and claim 
the job full time. 

.[ don't know," Harper said. 
· 1 haven't made that decision I 
yet." 

The big story for most of 
lriton athletics is its move to 
Division II. The move, however, 
does not affect the water polo 
squad. It plays in an open division 
against everyone, including 
Division I opponents. Many win 
over tough opponents is nothing 
new, and this year should not be 
any different

84 WELCOME WEEK SPEClAL The UCSD Guardian Tuesday, September 19, 2000 

The Editor's Soapbox 
A humble offering of advice from the new foatures editor 
By JOSH CROUSE 
Features Editor 

As this year's features editor for 
the Guardian , I would like to wel-
come everyone back for yet anoth-
er exciting year here at UCSD. 

Freshmen: This will be a new 
experience for you. Enjoy it and 
don 't pass up any opportunities to 
have fun . You 'll just end up regret-
ting it later. 

Sophomores: You 've been here 
before. You know the drill . Try to 
let loose a little more this year. 

Juniors: You're all old pros at 
this, but why don't you try going 
to a few classes this year? 

Seniors: Put down the beer and 
try to remember what '-'asses you 
are taking. Do yo u really want to 
have to tell people you're on the 
five-year plan? You do? You com-
mie bastards and your five-year 
plans .... 

Now that I've done gone and 
welcomed y'all proper like (yes, I 
am from a small farm town), I'd 
like to dish out a little advice from 
the vast ocean of knowledge that I 
have co llected in my one year here 
at UCSD. 

First of all, take full advantage 
of Welcome Week. This is the one 
time of the year when you have 
time just to slack off for an 
extended period of time (the Sun 
God fest ival doesn't count; it 's just 
one day) . Go to parties, meet peo-
ple and enjoy yourself. I remember 
during Welcome Week last year, I 
went around with a few friends 
and in troduced myself to everyone 
in the Warren dorms. Guys, I met 

plenty of good-looking women 
during the rounds. You can too. 

Second, for all of you underage 
students, especially freshmen , be 
sure to take a trip down to good 
01' TJ before classes start. Most 
freshmen have not yet experienced 
the raw power that is Tijuana , 
Mexico. The place is full of clubs, 
alcohol and members of the oppo-
site sex looking to hook up. It's a 
place to which most freshmen 
make repeat visits, and where most 
upperclassmen occasionally revisit 
for nostalgia . 

Just be careful and responsible 
while down there. Remember, you 
are in another counny - some-
times I amaze even myself with the 
crap I write; just be sure to come 
back alive. I'll personally be going 
south of the border for the sec-
ond-annual Josh's Night-Before-
Classes Trip to TJ. Everyone is 
welcome. I'll be at Club Safari all 
night long. 

Finally, be sure to get all of 
your stuff situated and in control 
before classes start. There is noth-
ing worse than trying to deal with 
a phone company, Academic 
Computing Services, the regis-
trar's office and a 10-page paper 
all at the same time. nust me, I 
know from experience. Just handle 
all of your business before classes 
start . You 'll thank me for it later. 

OK, I'm done lecturing you. 
You are all fairly bright individu-
als, I assume - you made it here, 
didn't you? Just trust your judg-
ment and have fun . 

Seeing as I'm going to be the 
features editor at the Guardian for 

The summer started out 
on an extremely positive 
note. I came home to a 
girl and a solid week of 
partying. Drinking 
through hangovers 
became a common 
practice for me: It was 
like a week of Sun God. 
You upper classmen know 
what I'm talking about. 
. You freshman had better 
ask somebody. 
the entire year (hopefully), I would 
like to take a linle bit of time to let 
you all get to know me. In order to 
do that, I'm going to revive a tradi-
tion that dates back to the earliest 
days of grammar school. I'm going 
to tell you all what I did this sum-
mer. 

The summer started out on an 
extremely positive note. I came 
home to a girl and a solid week of 
partying. Drinking through hang-
overs became a common practice 
for me. It was like a week of Sun 
God. You upperclassmen know 
what I'm talking about. You fresh -
men had better ask somebody. 

After a while, my mom started 
nagging me to get a job. Reluc-
tantly, I threw some water on my 
face, shaved. put on some decent 
clothes and began my search for 
summer employment. 

I had turned down a few 
internships because I didn 't really 
want to do anything that took 
brain power this summer, so I 
looked into being a waiter at a few 
restaurants. I had one job set up at 
a pub called Wellington Station. I 
was all set to start working when I 
decided to visit my friends at the 
Turlock Journal, the newspaper 
where 1 had worked for two years 
prior to college. 

When 1 entered the building. 
the editor in chief immediately 
offered me an internship. He 
wanted me to write a story every 
now and then and do research for 
articles. I told him I would consid-
er it, but I didn 't really want to do 
that kind of work. It wasn't two 
hours later that he called me and 
offered me a full-time job as a 
writer for the summer. It paid a lot 
better than the waiter job, so I 
accepted. 

When I walked into work the 
next week and was introduced to 
the rest of the staff (it wasn't very 
many people, seeing as it's a small-

town paper), they couldn 't have fi t 
the stereotypes for their positions 
any bener. Our arts and entertain-
ment writer was a struggling 
actor/comedian. He cracked jokes 
throughout the day to break the 
monotony. 

There was our police and fire 
department reporter, who was a 
lawyer before deciding he didn 't 
like the profession. His tales of law 
school were humorous at times. 
We also had a <:ity reporter who 
was the biggest Okie known to 
man. All he talked about was 
young women and fast cars. 
Somehow he managed to do a 
good job covering .politics. Go fig-
ure. 

Finally, we had a Web editor 
who had a severe stuner and was 
constantly stressed out . Inexplica-
bly, we managed to put out a 
decent paper every day. 

Somewhere along the way, I 
decided I wanted more money in 
my pocket, so I decided to take on 
another job. 1 began working at an 
international marketing fi rm (so 
much for not thinking this sum-
mer). It got me an extra couple 
hundred a week working part-
time, so I didn 't complain. There 
was also a beautiful girl that I 
worked with whom I got to know 
really, really well . 

Most of my summer was spent 
working and partying. I was seeing 
a girl (not the one from work) for 
most of the summer until I broke 
it off. She started talking about 
gening married and the future.

The need for sleep 
Studies show college students need sleep 
By KELLY WONG 
Staff Writer 

Summer is over and the 
school year is beginning all 
over again. For most UCSD 
students, the habit of sleep-
ing 10-plus ho urs every day 
fo r t he past three months is 
going to change with the 
busy schedules at school. 

[t is not surprising tha t 
studies show the biggest 
group suffering from lack of 
sleep is college studen ts. 

. According to the National 
Sleep Foundation, "Many 
young adults keep relatively 
irregular hours, and as a 
group they report higher 
rates of dissatisfaction with 
the sleep they are getting." 

Although stude nts may 
not realize it, maintaining a 
sufficient and consistent 
sleep pattern can help them 
pay - ttention in class, avoid 
errors, accidents, injuries, 
dea ths and other catastro-
phes .. Ultimately, sleeping 
we ll can also lead to better 
grades . 
SYMPTOMS OF SLEEP 
DEPRIVATION 

Some common symptoms 
of lack of sleep include diffi-
culty studying, diminished 
productivity, the tendency to 
make mistakes, irritability, 
fatigue, trouble staying alert 
dur ing boring or monoto-
nous situations, and a ten-
dency to be unreasonably 
irritable wi th co-workers, 

family or fr iends. If these 
symptoms seem familiar, you 
are most likely suffering from 
lack of sleep. 
WHAT IS SLEEP? 

Despite a century of sci-
enti fic study of sleep, includ-
ing three decades of modern 
intensive research, the func-
tioo of sleep remains a bio-
logical enigma. When a per-
son fa lls as leep, h is body 
abrupt ly shuts down the 
neura l processes that faci li -
tate the perception of the 
world around him. 

According to www 
.sleepquest. com, • Sleep is a 
behavioral state of complete 
perceptual disengagement 
from the environment. It is 
an active process in . which 
sensory stimulation is 
blocked or modified in some 
way such that we cease to be" 
conscious of the world 
around us." 

Simply stated, sleep 
detaches ' us from our sur-
roundings. As for the pur-
pose of sleep, one hypothesis 
from a UCLA medical school 
Web site (hltp://bisleep 
.medsch. uc/a.edulsleepsyllablls) 
is that sleep serves to reverse 
and restore biochemical and 
physiological processes that 
are progressively degraded 
during prior wakefulness. 
WHAT CAUSES US TO 
F.f:EL SLEEPY? 

The size of a person's 
sleep debt measures the 
strength of the tendency for

one to fall asleep. If the sleep 
debt is zero, sleep is impossi-
ble. If the sleep debr is very 
low, only a small amount of 
stimulation is requi red to 
stay awake. 

Conversely, if the sleep 
debt is large, no amount of 
stimu lation ca n keep a per-
son awake.' Although most 
people assume th at certain 
th ings can cause a person to 
fa ll asleep, in most cases, they 
actually do not. In o ther 
words, boredom, a warm 
room or a heavy meal does 
not cause drowsiness; they 
merely indicate to the indi-
vidual how much leep debt 
he has. A large sleep debt is 
what causes us to feel sleepy. 
HOW MUCH SLEEP IS 
ENOUGH? 

Although most healthy 
adults ' and college students 
need an average of eight 
hours of sleep per night, 
sleep needs vary from indi-
vidual to individual. Some 
people can fu nction well, 
without significa nt sleepiness 
or drowsiness, after as little 
as six hours of sleep. Others 
cannot perform at their peak 
unless they have slept 10 
hours. 

All lost sleep accumulates 
progressively into a larger 
sleep indebtedness, and this 
sleep debt does not go away 
or spontaneously decrease. 
The only way to reduce your

Cityyiew: Adams Avenue 
Three small communities create their own special cultures foil of great food entertainment and shopping 
By UNDSAY SWORSKI 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

In a coastal city like San Diego, west 
means money. Drive east on any m~jor street, 
and it is fascinating to watch the income tax 
brackets drop ever so gradually. San Diego is 
sold on the beauty of its beaches, but there is 
just not enough space for everyone to have a 
room with a coastal view. With the great loca-
tion of UCSD, it is not surprising that east is 
nO! a direction that students think of going 
until, perhaps, they're budgeting their own 
money. 

Adams Avenue has become one of the 
new main streets for the increasing number 
of students who have begun migrating east. It 
is not only the rising property values that 
make the location so attractive. Adams 
Avenue has the neat, odd feeling of a civilized 
place without Starbucks and fast food . It has 
that special aura of kids in the streets, older 
buildings, small post offices. vegetarian 
restaurants next to good Irish pubs and pri-
vately owned shops. 

Driving east along Adams takes you 
through the communities of University 
Heights, Normal Heights and Kensington, 
respectively, each with its own neon street 
sign. In their proximity, these communities 
share a similar flavor, though each has its 
own highlights. 

Kensington is home to Landmark's Ken 
Theater, which shows top documentaries, old 
flicks and good independent films. Next 
door, Kensington Video has every obscure 
video you could ever hope to find . Food from 
vegetarian restaurant Jyoti Bihanga, located 
in Normal Heights, is served at the UCSD 
Food Co-op. Across the street, Irish pub 
Rosie O'Gradies houses the occasional rock 
'n ' roll band that gets even the old people 
dancing. University Heights also has great 
bars like Lancers, complete with pool tables 
and a dart board, and coffee shops like Twig-

gs, which hosts open poetry readings every 
month. There is even a big blue car wash 
painted with colored bubbles, not imitating 
the '7Os, but actually from the '70s. 

One reason every UCSD student should 
take a drive out to these parts is the cultural 
diversity. The houses and apartments that 
line the streets off Adams Avenue are home 
to blacks, whites, Mexicans and Asians. There 
is a richne~s of ethnicity that is just not 

found nearer the coast, and certainly not 
within UCSD. The regents should fund field 
trips out to Adams Avenue so each student 
can experience the demographic makeup of 
our country and have a pint of ale on the 
Irish. 

Even without the surf and turf there is a 
lot going on along Adams. Avenue. To get 
there you can take the Adams Avenue exit off 
Interstate 80S and tum right. You can also

WHAT IS INSOMNIA? 

Although most people at ti mes 
'have trouble sleepll1g, insomnia is 
a severe sleep disorder that cuases 
individuals to find it nearly 
impossible to fa ll as leep. When 
they finally do, they don '( sleep 
soundly and they awake early, 
unable to -go back to sleep. 
WHAT CAUSES 
INSOMNIA? 

Insomnia is generally caused 
by a cfrastic change in daily rou-
tine: starting a new job, sleeping 
in a new room, or even beginning 
the school year after a relaxing 
summer. This type of insomnia, 
however, usually goes away in a 
few days. 

It is the insomnia that lasts for 
more than a short period of time 
that can be a more serious prob-
lem. Depression, anxiety and ill-

nesses that cause pain. nausea or 
shortness of breath can cause 
ch ronic insomnia . If insomnia 
accompanied by these symptoms 
is observed, it is best to talk to a 
doctor to find a suitable treat-
ment. 
THE FACTORS OF A 
SLEEP·DEPRIVED 
SOCIETY 

According to the National 
Sleep Foundation, stress is con-
sidered by most sleep experts to 
be the No. 1 cause of short-term 

Although nwst people 
have trouble sleeping, 
others have more trouble 
falling asleep. They find 
it hard to fall asleep, 
they do not sleep soundly 
and they wake up early

symptams of insomnia. 

sleeping difficulties. Some com-
mon triggers include school or 
job-related pressures, a family or 
marriage problem, or a serious ill-
ness or death in the family. 

However, if short-term sleep-
ing problems such as insomnia 
are not managed properly from 
their onset, they can persist long 
after the original stress has 
passed. 

Also, lifestyle stresses lead to a

sleep-deprived society. Drinking 
alcohol or beverages containing 
caffeine in the afternoon or 
evening, exercising close to bed-
time, following an irregular morn-
ing and nighttime schedule, and 
working or doing other mentally 
intense activities right before or 
after getting into bed can be seri-
ous obstacles on the toad to a 

go~c! night's sleep. 
Environmental interferences 

are also factors in sleep depriva-
tion. A distracting sleep environ-
ment such as a room that is too 
hot or co ld, noisy or too brightly 
lit can be a barrier to sound sleep. 
WHAT IS THE SECRET TO 
GOOD SLEEP? 

The National Sleep Founda-
tion offers several guidelines for 
getting quality sleep. 

Avoid caffeine, nicotine and 
alcohol in the late afternoon and 
evening. Caffeine and nicotine 
can delay your sleep. and alcohol 
may interrupt your sleep later in 
the night. 

If you have trouble sleeping 
when you go to bed, do not nap 
during the day, as it affects your 
ability to sleep at night . 

Exercise regularly, but do so at 
least three hours before bedtime. 
A workout after that time may 
actually keep you awake because 
your body has not had a chance to 
cool down . 

Establish a regular. relaxing 
bedtime routine that will allow 
you to unwind and send a notice 
to your brain that it is time to 
sleep. Avoid exposure to bright

History 

Galbraith Hall was constructed in 1965, one of the first new buildings on the 
UCSD campus. It operated as the University Library until the occupancy of the 
current Geisel library building in 1972. A branch undergraduate library 
remained on a portion of the upper two floors . tlGL served UCSD's students 
well until it closed two years ago, part of a major capital improvement project 
that encompassed the library space as well as the rest of Galbraith Hall. Now 
ready to re-open as the first new UC library of the 21st century, CLlCS will 
bring together the ideas, services, and technology that students need to be 
productive and competitive. 
Hours 

CllCS Fall Quarter Hours: Sunday - Thursday 10:00am - 1:00am; Friday-
Saturday 10:00am - 10:00pm; December 1 - 8 10:00am - 3:00am

The resources UCSD students, faculty 
and staff need are now easier to locate 
using the redesigned UCSD libraries 
website at http://libraries.ucsd.edu. Our site 
features Sage, a selection of the best 
websites, databases, electronic journals, 
dissertations and other materials for 
research and instructional needs. UCSD's 
aCademic disciplines are featured in this 
comprehensive collection of websites. The 
new site also provides easy, consistent links 
to ROOER and the California Digital 
Library Databues. Information on haun. 
locatiOns, and services for all the libraries 
is now together in one place. 
The Libraries' website emphasizes high 

quality raearch tools. Genera1 search 
engines like Google or AltaVista do not 
provide acccu to licensed scholarly 
publications. Why spend hoon sorting 
through hundreds or thou.ands of search 

engine results, many of which are dupli-
cates, irrelevant or unteliabler The new 
site includes subject-based search tools 
with hnks to thousands of full-text 
publications that the Libraries have 
purchased for your use. Materials unavail-
able on campus can be obtained by using 
Web-based request forms. 

The new design is based upon ongoing 
usab~ity testing with you - our audience of 
UCSD faculty, students and staff. If you 
would like to participate in the continuing 
development of the libraries web site, or if 
you have any comments or suaestions, 
please use the e-mail feedback links 
located on each page. User feedback has 
been invaluable in helping us to fine tune 
the Libraries' IWW lite, and we look 
forward to hearing your opinion. Stop by 
any UCSD library for more information.

In recent years, more and more databases 
have been created which contain records 
for items from small, alternative, leftist, 
ethnic, women's, and/or gay/lesbian 
publishers. The Social Sciences & 
Humanities librarians and staff are very 
pleased to include some of these types of 
databases in our list of choices so you can 
enhance your research by learning about 
viewpoints from outside the mainstream 
press. 

Here are a few examples of such data-
bases and their descriptions. All can be 
accessed from the Databases A-Z link on 
our home page: http://libraries.ucsd.edu.

topics covered includes globalization, law, 
social and cultural theory, race and 
emnicity, the environment, and women's 
studies.

this database gives researchers the points of 
view of publishers and journalists repre-
senting ethnic minorities and native 
peoples. It is a full·text collection of the 
newspapers, magazines and journals of the 
ethnic, minority and native press in the 
U.S. A rich collection of articles, editori-

participating Circuit library and check out an 
item in-person. Before driving to another 
Circuit library, be sure to check with any 
UCSD library to ensure that there are no 
holds or blocks on your library record (like,

The air is getting a bit cool-
er at night. Students are begin-
ning to flock back to campus. 
The summer is winding down. 
This can only mean one thing: 
It's Tijuana time. 

The age-old tradition of pil-
ing friends in the back of an 
economy car on the way to a 
night of clubbing south of the 
border is one that is near and 
dear to the hearts of many 
UCSD students. 

For some, the all-but-
required Welcome Week trip 
might be the only visit of the 
year to that magical place 

endearingly 
referred to as TJ. For others, 
T)'s famous college night on 
Wednesdays provides welcome 
relief to the stresses of college 
life. 

Whether someone is a one-
time traveler to TJ or a frequent 
clubber, there are many dan-
gers that lurk in Mexico's city 
of sin. For somebody who isn't 
careful, a 6x9 concrete block 
with lovely steel bars (also 
known as a Mexican jail cell) 
might become their permanent 
home. 

One of the biggest selling 

The UCSD Guardian 

points 
for TJ is its 
drinking age. 
While eager young 
Americans must wait 21 ago-
nizing years before ' coming of 
age to panake in the many 
alcoholic festivities in the Unit-
ed States, one need only be 18 
to take a swi$ of grandpa's old 
cough mediCine down in Tj. 

According to Lt. Vince 
Villavaso o( the San Diego 
Police Department, the drink-

ing 
age is the 
very thing that gets 
most people into trouble in 
Mexico. 

"Most of the incidents that 
arc reported involve excess 
drinking and the behavior that 
follows it," Villavaso said. "The 
students tend to get the feeling 
that being in another country 
means that it is a free-for-all 
and that there are no laws. That 
is one of the biggest miscon-
ceptions." 

The trutlt is that Mexico has 
many laws that are similar to 
those in the United States with 
regard to drinking. [n fact, 
many Mexican laws are even 
stricter than their U.S. counter-
parts. 

In Mexico, people who are 
found to be drunk in public or 
is driving while intoxicated will 
be arrested and taken straight 
to prison, where they remain 
until their court date, which 
could be several days away. 
Mexican courts have a different 
philosophy than American 
courtS. [n Mexico, the burden 
of proof falls on the person 
who is being accused. This 
could lead to an unwanted stay 
in a Mexican correctional facil -
ity. 
• As bad as an extended stay 

in prison may sound, it is not 
the worst consequence of 
excess drinking south of the 
border.

For 

women, rape is a real issue . 
There have been numerous 
cases involving women who 
were drugged in a TJ club 
before being raped, according 
to Villavaso. Several "date-
rape" drugs exist, including 
GHB and "rooties." 

Men are nQt immune from 
the dangers pf TJ ei~her. They 
can also fall victim to spiked 
drinks only to wake up and find 
their wallet is missing. Men are 
commonly the targets of many 
thieves and con artists in TJ. 

Another danger facing men 
in TJ is violence. Fights erupt in 
TJ quite often and can lead, 
again, to incarceration in Mex-
ican prison. 

The danger does not SlOp at 
the border either. Many Ameri-
cans return from Mexico 
unscathed and think they are 
out of danger. Not so, as there 
are still serious consequences 
that can happen on the U.S. 
side of the border. 

The main risk is that of 
being !'rrested. While it is legal 
for anyone over 18 to drink in 
MexiICO, the legal age for alco-
hol consumption is still 21 in 
the United States. As a result,

light before bedtime. Taking a 
bath may also help to relax the 
body in preparation for sleep. 

Do not use your bed for any-
thing other than sleep. Your bed 
should be associated with sleep. 

Consider your sleep environ-

ment. Make it as/leasant, com· 
fortable, dark an quiet as you 
can. 

If you cannot go to sleep after 
30 minutes, don't stay in bed 
tossing and turning. Get up and 
involve yourself in a relaxing 
activity, such as listening to 
soothing music or reading until 
you feel sleepy. Try to clear your 
mind; do not use this time to 
solve dai!J problems. 
WHEN DO YOU NEED TO 
SEEK HELP? 

The UCSD Guardian 

If sleep problems persist for 
longer than a week and are both-
ersome, or if sleepiness interferes 
with the way you feel or function 
during the day, a doctor's help 
may be needed. 

Remember that what works 
for some might not work for oth-
ers, so each person must attack 
this prob1em from a different 
angle. If a doctor finds insomnia 
to be the cause of sleeplessness, 
medication may remedy the 
problem.

Tijuana: 
Tips on huw to stay safe 
while south of the border 
ContI .. eeI front ..... 117 
minors can be arrested for being 
under the influence even if they 
do not have a blood-alcohol con-
tent of 0.08, the legal limit for 
those 21 and over while driving. 
Regardless of age, TJ-goers may 
also be arrested for public intoxi-
ca tion if they are perceived by 
officers to be unable to care for 
themselves. 

The penalty for being drunk in 
public includes a four-hour stay 
in the Detoxification Center 
located just north of the border. 
Someone found guilty of being 
drunk in public, a misdemeanor, 
will also incur a minimum fine of 
$1 ,000 or six months in jail. 

According to Villavaso, one 
would have to be very intoxicated 
to be arrested for being drunk in 
public at the border. 

"A lot of what we look for is 
behavior: Villavaso said. "If 
someone is unable to care for 
their safety or the safety of others, 
then they may be arrested . This 
could include staggering, being 
carried over the border by friends, 
or picking fights. If someone has 

had a few drinks though, we real-
ly have no problem there." 

TJ-goers should also avoid dri-
ving under the influence. Accord-
ing to Villavaso, there is an opera-
tion funded through gtants from 
the California Office' of lraffic 
Safety that allows American offi-
cers to set up checkpoints twice a 
month to check for drunk drivers. 
Villavaso said the program is very 
successful, catching 12 to 15 
offenders each time. 

"The area close to Mexico is 
considered to have a higher-than-
normal rate of drunkenness: 
Villavaso said. "There are a lot of 
people that drink in Mexico and 
then try to drive in the United 
States." 

Those caught driving under 
the influence in the United States 
are subject to jail time, fines and a 
revoked license. 

Another danger on the U.S. 
side of the border is fighting. 
According to Officer Martin Cas-
tro of the San Diego Police 
Department, there was a major 
fight on the American side of the 
border in 1998. According to Cas-
tro, approximately 400 people 
were involved in a near-riot situa-
tion in which people were being 
thrown across counters and 
punched into tables at the Jack-
In-The-Box restaurant that sits 

The UCSD Guardian 

near the San Ysidro border cross-
ing. 

With all of the dangers facing 
students who go to Mexico just to 
have a good time, one might won-
der why anyone would subject 
himselfto such danger. According 
to Villa va SO, there are several pre-
cautions that potential TJ-goers 
can take to be safe. 

"I would definitely advise that 
people go in large grou ps: 
Villavaso said. "They should also 
stay in their groups once they get 
down there. The likelihood of 
someone gening attacked is far 
less in a group." 

Another advantage of being in 
a group is that people can keep an 
eye on one another and offer 
assistance as needed. 

Villavaso advised that 
if there is going tQ be 
drinking in Mexico, 
there should be a 
designated driver. 
Having someone in 
the group that is 
sober can also help 
to keep the intoxicat-
ed members of the 
group fro m doing 
something inadvisabfe. 

When traveling to TJ, 
students should always 
have a valid form of identi-
fication with them. Any state 

identification will suffice. 
Students should also avoid 

carrying large amounts of cash or 
valuables. ATMs should be avoid-
ed in Mexico as they are the site of 
frequent robberies. 

If Students park their cars on 
the U.S. side of the border, they 
are advised to park in well-lit 
areas. Students driving into Mexi-
co should remember to wear seat 
belts at all times and to obey all 
traffic laws, which are very 
similar to those in the 
Uni ted States,

Finally, Villavaso advises that 

people should just use common 
sense when they are in Mexico. 
Students need to recognize that 
they are in another country, 
though it does have laws similar 
to those in the United States. 

Students should keep in mind

Volunteering at a hospital is not 
for everyone. However, many other 
service programs exist and may peak 
your interest. UCSD's Volunteer 
Connection offers several projects, 
some of which include Best Buddies. 
Friends Understanding Needs, 
Active Students for Kids, Eyes on the 
Elderly, and Active Students for 
Teens. Visit http://www-
acs.ucsdedul- volconnl for more infor-
mation. 

If nonr of these options seem 
appealing, offer to help out at a local 
political campaign office, a dentist's 
office, a library, a law office, a labora-
tory or any other prospective place 
of employment. Although some of 
the programs t.i sted above were 
established for purely humanitarian 

• purposes, other volunteer jobs or 
intemship~ can introduce students 
to potential careers.

ture. 

Outback Adventures provides 

Maguire," continues his crowd-
pleasing, hyper-sentimental style 
with a classic "pauper to prince" 
formula and an after-school moral 
about the price of popularity. It's 
at least worth the price for the 
soundtrack. 

Grade: A-

"American Pimp" 
Directors: Allen and Albert 

Hughs 
Plot: "American Pimp· is a raw 

yet disturbingly amusing docu -
mentary about one of America's 
most dubious professions. Real-
life pimps such as Rosebudd, 
Bishop Don Magic Juan and Gor-
geous Dre try to tackle the essen-
tial question of why pimps are 
necessary. 

The question never gets com-
pletely answered, but you do leave 
the theater with a whole slew of 
words such as "ho,· "players/' "the 
turn-out· and "gators" swirling 
through your head. But behind 
th e gold caps and platform boots 
lies a twisted structure of 

one of the best ways to meet new 
people, enjoy nature and get in 
shape. Located in a grove of tree3 
behind the Cross Cultural Center, 
Outback Adventures allows groups 
to custom design outings for cam-
pus organizations. Its guides are 
trained to lead team-building exer-
cises. 

The UCSD Recreation guide lists 
many of Outback's day, evening and 
weekend trips, some of which 
include: sea kayaking, exploring 
caves, backpacking, mountain biking 
and rock climbing. It is also the best 
place to rent outdoor equipm!!nt 
such as backpacks and skis. To find

Grade: B 

. "The Art of War" 
Director: Christian Duguay 
Cast: Wesley Snipes, Marie 

Matiko, Anne Archer and Donald 
Sutherland 

Plot: Finally, we have an action 
movie that doesn't require a 
"matrix· or some other sci-fi 
doohickie to sell to the public. 

Snipes plays a super spy who 
gets caught in a web of espionage 
centering around t,he flailing 
negotiations for a trade pact 
between China and the United 
States. 

The opening scene is very fast 
and furious, giving an edge that 
the recent James Bond movies 
seem to have missed. The fren zied 
and engrossing action is supple-
mented by engaging direction that 
uses flashbacks to reconstruct 
crime scenes. It's worth your stu-
dent discount. 

Grade: A-

"Autumn in New York" 
Director: Joan Chen 
Cast: Richard Gere, Anthony 

LaPaglia and Winona Ryder 
Plot: A boy who can never 

grow up (Gere) and a girl who 
refuses to grow old (Ryder) meet 
and fall in love. Stick in a terminal 
disease and you have the right 
ingredients for a classic tearjerker 
or stomach-churner, depending 
on your disposition toward fatal -
istic romances. 

Grade: C 

"Bait" 
Director: Antoine Fuqua 
Cast: Jamie Foxx, David Morse 

and David Paymer 
Plot: A "reformed · convict 

(Foxx) gets mixed up in an FBI 
sting to catch a killer, only he 
doesn't know it yet. Foxx st irs up 
the fi lm wi th his own absent-
minded , hip-hop flavor. Just like 
watching an . hou r-and-a-half-
long episode of Foxx's television 
show, "The Jamie Foxx Show." 

Grade: B-
"Bring It On" 

Director: Peyton Reed 
Cas t: Kirsten Dun st, Eliza 

Dushku and Jesse Bradford 
Plot : An in -the- middle fi lm 

about Ameri ca's preppy and 
peppy world of competitive cheer-
leading. There is nothing much 
here to look at except bouncing 
bobs of blond hair and the fresh 
silicone following. 

Grade: D 

"The Cell" 
Director: Tarsem Singh 
Cast : Jennifer Lopez, Vince 

Vaughn, Vincent D'Onofrio and 
Marianne Jean-Baptiste 

Plot: A psychotherapist

comatose serial killer (D'Onofrio) 
in the hopes of saving. his laSt vic-
tim. Dark fetishes are exposed

Wonderful strides in medern cin-

Grade: A 

"Duets" 
Director: Bruce Paltrew 
Cast: Gwyneth Paltrow, Huey 

Lewis, Paul Giamani and Andre 
Braugher. 
.. Plot: A $5.000 karaeke cempe-

tItion III Omaha lures six charac-
ters together on one of those 
"unforgettable" trips. Maybe this 
is a film that enly karaeke enthu-
siast~ might understand; ether-
wise, the stagnant pace and watch-
ing Paltrew "sing" falls shert of 
any great expectation. 

Grade: C-

"The Watcher" 
Director: Joe Charbanic 
Cast:, Keanu Reeves, James 

Spaoer. Marisa Tomei and Ernie 
Hudson 

Plot: A detective (Spader) gives 
up tracking a serial killer (Reeves) 
and moves to a quiet city. Missing 
his old buddy, Reeves visits his 

fermer pursuer and begins send-
ing him pictures of new victims, 
ene ef which is the dick's psychia-
trist (Tomei) . 

Reeves takes another shot at 
breaking out ef his deadhead role 
by playing this multi-dimensional 
killer. His performance is some-
what convincing, but Reeves 
sheuld stick to. praying characters 
like Siddhartha rather than Dah-
mer. Adequate suspense is exuded 
to. held yeur attention, but neth-
ing shocking enough to. warrant 
mere kudes. 

Grade: B-

"Nurse BettY' 
Directer: Neil LaBute 
Cast: Renee Zellweger, Mergan 

Freeman, Chris Reck and Greg 
Kinnear 

Plot: An everzealous widow 
(Zellweger) suffers a psychotic 
breakdown- resulting frem her 
obsession with a soap star. Free-
man and Rock are the key to this 
film as their dynamic interaction 
as hitmen cuts through with edgy 
humor and sarcasm. Directer La 
Bute. known fer "In the Cempany 
of Men." offers an unpelished 
view on human ebsession and the 
quirky nuances of working with 
yeur relatives. The comedy is dark . 
and impeccable while the vielence 
is equally jaw dropping. Nurse 
Betty is one ef the best films to 
have come out this year.
