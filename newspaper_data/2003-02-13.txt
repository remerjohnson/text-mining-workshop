UCSD reports $1.7 bil. in revenue 
Campus adds $4.6 billion to state economy 

Lecture traces history 
of UCSD activism 
AJurnni~peakersrell!~rnber 

experIences as aCtIVIsts 
By MAn SCHRADER 

Senior Staff Writer 

Amid current and potential new 
state budget cutS, UCS D st ill 
recorded an economic impact of 
over $4.6 billion last year, a 
revealed m the school's annual 
report released on Feb. 12 . 

"I thmk it's very impressive tha t 
UCSD makes such a major contri-
hurion to the economy," said 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Resource Management Margaret 
F. Pryatel. " It ccrrain.1y means a lot 
to the economy, given its current 
state." 

The $-l.6 billion figure is made 
up primarily of the $1.046 billion 
the school spent on goods and ser-
vices, the $831 .6 million spent on 
sa laries, the $76 million spenr by 
snldents and visitors, the $119.2 
million ~pent on fina ncial aid and 
scholarships for 11,673 students, 
and the $186.6 million on federal, 
sta te and payroll taxes. 

The UCSD Office of 
Technology Transfer and 
Intellectual Property Services also 
reports that over 10 new compa-
Illes and over 300 new Inventions 
and copyrights were created as a 
result of the school's advanced 
technologies. The lechT[PS 
research led to an additional $13 .5 
million given for roya lties and for 
funding [unare research. 

The annua l report also revealed 
that the school had revenues of 
over $1.7 billion in the 2002 fiscal 
year. The most substantial source 
of income for the campus was the 
$550 million the school received to 
co nduct research. This mark, 
which is over $40 million more 
than last year's research money, 

places UCS D at fi fth in the nation 
in federal research awards. 

[n addi tion to research money, 
UCSD also received $435.5 million 
generated by the school's hospitals 
and clinic, $4 11 million from feder-
al research awards, $356.7 nllll ion 
from the state of California, $143.6 
million from educational activities, 
$129.7 mi llion given in gifts, grants 
and contracts, and $129.6 mi ll ion 
from tuition and fees. 

T his figure of $1.7 billion may 
in fact decline next year due to 
both current and projected budget 
cuts for UC schools. 

According to Prya tel , research 
funding was cut 10 percent, or $2.4 
million, at the beginning of the 
year, while another $3 .1 million of 
total funding was cut in the middle 
of the year. 

"The economic realities of the 
year challenged us, as it did all 
Americans, to plan and work more 
wisely than ever," said Chancellor 
Robert C. Dynes. "Although we 
are III a major growth period, as 
our student body continues to 
grow and our state funding faces 
evere cuts, the administration, fac-

ulty and staff continue to maintain 
a can-do spirit." 

Pryatel said that UCSD, which 
is already overenrolled by 500 stu-
dents, has been told by the state 
that it must take an additional 900 
students above its normal enroll -
ment maximum, due to the 
increasi ng number of applicants to 
UC schools. 

A decrease in state funding 
occurred once before in the early 
'90s, although the school was not 
going through a concurrent enroll-
ment expansion. 

UCSD, which is currently

going through a large enrollment 
growth period, is presently 
involved in an $800 million expan-
sion that wi ll incl ude the construc-
tion of new lecture halls, research 
bui ldi ngs, conference and housing 
faci lities, and parking structures. 

The money to fund this expan-
sion is being generated through 
bond measures and will not affect 
UCSD's state funding. 

"We are in good shape in the

will have a problem paying the

the same problems tenured profes-

salaty will increase next year, follow-

"This does not bode well for the 
University of Califorlll3 school," 
Pryatel said. "We are crying to get 
new faculty, but it has been difficult." 

However, salaries are not the 
only item that faces budget cuts

In honor of Black History 
month, the African American 
Snadent Union of UCSD held 
"The History of Political 
Activism" at the Cross-Cultural 
Center on Feb. II to discuss and 
promote rna ners of student 
activism in the UCSD campus, 
notably among the black commu-
nity. 

Alumni guest speakers pre-
sented their own expenences of 
activism here at UCSD when 
they were students themselves, 
including Assistant Vice 
Chancellor Ed Spriggs and 
Assistant Director of Leadership 
Opportunities Marcia Strong. 

The narratives of Spriggs and 
Srrong both accounted for the 
early years of UCSD when stu-
dent activism was common, but 
the presence of mlnori tie 
enrolled in school was rare. 
Spriggs recalled his own college 
years as a Revelle College student 
in the late 1 960s, when anti-war 
movements and the Civil Rights 
Movement were two Issues that 
were widely protested and dis-
cussed on college campuses across 
the nation. 

The forum not only empha-
sized student activism in general, 
but the history of UCSD's past 
instances of activism that were 
jumpstarted by the black and chJ-
cano community. 

Spriggs advocated a stronger 

black voice, saying, "We had to 
take anion, and what better place 
[to do sol than m our own back-
yard of the UCSD campus)" 

Among other things, mlnon-
ties during the late 19605 partiCI -
pated in sit-ins and marches to 
establish the Third College, now 
known as Thurgood Marshall 
College but originally referred to 
as Lumumba-ZapatJ College, a, a 
school that embraces the millon-
ty community at UCSD, IOclud-
ing blacks and chicanos. 

UCSD has a hlstorv of 
actiVism In the past, Includi~g an 
instance when certain groups 
refused to graduate along wah 
their peers. 

Spriggs reca lled hiS own grad-
uation in 1970, when a prepared 
speech was delivered on behalf of 
the students and parents of the 
minority community. [n thl~ 
speech, the graduates voiced out 
their concerns of feeling excluded 
from the rest of the college com-
mUnity. 

The speech went on to state, 
"We will not be allowed as tOkem 
of deceitful and false liberalism," 
as a response to the unlver Ity 
accepting more mlnontles as J 
means of becoming more liberal. 

From such proceedings of 
activism, Spriggs hoped to estab-
lish a precedence of equal fights 
and opportunities among blacks.

UCSD responds 
sensitively to 

death of student 
La t week, UC D suffered a loss that 

touches us all. \iVhether we knew John 
Muir College junior atalie ummerfish or 
not, the death of a young and talented stu-
dent like her can devastate a campus - and 
that grief, shared or per onal, is part of an 
important healing proces . 

The Guardifl11 would first and foremost 
like to extend Our heartfelt sympathies to 
ummerfish's family and friends. Nothing 

we can say can really ease their pain at this 
trying time, but we hope that they find 
solace in sharing their memories of 
Sunlmerfish and in celebrating her life. 

There is a temptation in these kinds of 
situations to question the circumstances 
that led to such a tragedy. Perhaps the most 
frequenr response ro hearin~ of this occur-
rence was a variation of 'Does anyone 
know why?" As we struggle to put this into 
an understandable frame of mind, it is 
important to consider using the different 
re ouces available to all students to help 
cope. 

In an e-mail ent to students on Feb. 10, 
Muir Dean Patricia Mahaffey wrote that 
Summerfish's death "diminishes us all." 
While it is true that we all suffer a loss 
when a student passes away, it is also 
heartening that the admin 'strators at 
UCSD are working to keep our loss to a 
minimum. 

Our thanks go to those at UCSD who 
responded so quickly and so sensitively to 
this tragedy. That counselors were dis-
patched to Pacific Hall immediately after-
ward is a sign of the dedication of UCSD's 
team of psychologists. 

These profeSSIOnals from Psychological 
and Counseling ervices are available to all 
students free of charge in respon e to last 
week's tragedy. However, it bears repeating 
that their doors are also open to any stu-
dent in need of psychiatric help or simply 
someone to talk with about anything. We 
sincerely hope that students suffering from 
depreSSIon will take advantage of this valu-
able and complimentary service - and get 
help before it s too late to turn back from a 
desperate course of action. Psychological 
and Counseling Service's offices are located 
in Galbraith Hall and can be reached at

American media spread lies about love 
Unrealistic expectations damage relationships 

By CARRIE EUlABETH SKLAR 
Sentor Staff Writer 

Culturally speaking, when it comes 
lO love and relationships, we are all 
screwed. And not m a good way. 

Nearly every single form of media 
used by our society is constantly giving 
us rdeas about what love is, how we can 
recognne it, how we can find it and 
what we should do WIth it. The only 
problem is, most of the messages sem 
about tlus subject are lies. Our medIa 
are continually telling us to strive to 
IIId and k.eep an ideal that docs not 

and cannot exist, and because of the 
expectations we fonn as a result, our 
relationships suffer. 

Messages about love are every-
where: love songs, romance novels, 
magnines, movies, teleVlslon show 
and fairy 12les. There is no getting 
away from them, and they all set up 
ImpoSSIble expectations about love -
expectauons we thmJc we can apply to 
our own lives But we can't, and we 
shouldn't think that the media's version 
of love IS at all rcalisric or al1:alllable. 

\¥hen we are Iuds, we are taught 
that love em and should be perfect. We 
are told that Cinderella and Prrnce 
Charming fell madly III love the 
moment tlley saw each other at the 
ball, and not even jealous sibllllgs and 
lost footwear could keep them apart. 

0, they were meant to be together, 
and fale always finds a way lO make 
sure that true love tJ'lumphs over all . 
And then, of courS(, they lived happily 
ever after. 

Then we get older, and we start to 
walch what are commonly referred to 
as "chIcle flIcks." In "Never Been 
)(j sed," Jo ie refuses lO settle for any-
thlllg less than the moment when 
"$omerime you'll lass someon and 
know thal's the person you're supposed 
to kiss for the rest of your life." And 

COMMENTARY 

" It's not always clear when 
we are in loving relation' 
ships, and it's often even 
less clear if OUT partners 

love us back." 
though Josie has been deceiving her 
teacher, Sam, throughout their 
courtship, they are fated to end up 
together - so they do, and the movie 
ends after they share a perfecllass. 

In "The Princess Bride," Buttercup 
falls madly in love with Wesley when 
he hands her a pItcher. And though the 
attractive young couple is separated 
when Wesley leaves to make hi for -
tune, and Buttercup is tOld he is dead, 
the film goes on to show that despite 
such obsucles as a lustful, greedy 
prmce and several near-death expen -
cnces, Weslcy and Buttercup are meant 
to be together, and are destined to lIVe 

together in bliss. 
Notice a theme yet? 
We are constantly told to believe in 

fate and true, perfect love. And of 
course, once we find our suul male, we 
will of course live happily ever after 
together. These movies and fairy tales 
are designed to let us pretend that we 
are the princess or newspaper reponer 
th.at will eventually end up with the 
man of her dreams. We see these char-
acters achieve happiness in theIr rela-
tionships, and we believe that as a 
result, we can do the ame. We can 
have the fairy tale - doesn't Julia 
Roberts say t1lat exact line in " Preny 
Woman"? And doesn't she get her 
wish? Then we think we can do tlle 
same. 

All of these couples were clearly 
meant to end up together. But that 
means that they don't have to work al 
finding and keeping love. All Buttercup 
has to do is look at We~ley and she 
knows she's in love. Cmderella has to 
work a little harder - she aClually has 
to dance for a while first - bUl the 
message is the same. When you find 
your soul mate, "you JUSt know." And 
of course he or she will know I t, too. 
That's all there IS to it. 

Except in real life , It i~n 't. There's no 
t.heme song for real life to let us know 
when we have met "the one." It's not 
always clear when we are in IOVlng rela-
tionships, and it's often even le~s clear If 
our parOlers love us bacle. BUl becau. e 
of tile media, we thlllie that every I ela-
tionsillp should work exactly like (hey 
do m the movIes and fairy tales. 

And even a~sumjng U131 we do fall 
madly in love WIth our partners withlll 
an hour of meering, what about what 
happens afler mat? The world is not 
just like me ones created by 
Hollywood, and Irfe doe n't always

Military action in Iraq motivated by money 
Explanation found in concerns over dollar devaluation 

By ANDREW QUADRI 
Senior Staff Writer 

Nearly a year after the war on 
Saddam Hussei n became more 
important than the war on terror-
ism, the Iraq saga continues its 
role as the thinlUng person 's non-
fictional soap opera. 

In the last week alone, 
Secretary of State Colin Powell 
treated us to an impressive speech 
that outlined the need for war 
against Iraq. Two days later, The 
Lundon Timn revealed that one of 
his sources, a British "intelligence 
dossier," contained text plagiarized 
verbatim from magazine articles 
and included information that was 
over a decade old. Whoops. 
Understandably, the story has 
been downplayed in U.S. newspa-
pers - page A8 of the Nrw York 
TImes, well behind the latest terror 
alert, or in the case of tbt San 
Ditgo Union-Tribunt, unreported 
altogether. 

College students usually get 
kicked out of school for plagia-
rism. Will the British government 
fire tile juruor aides who created 
" Iraq : Its Infrastructure of 
Concealment, Deception and 
Intimidation"? For that matter, 
will the international community 
start 10 question the accuracy of 
other U.S . and British "intelli-
gence data" on Iraq ' Although the 
first scenario seems more likely 
than the latter, neither will actual-
ly happen. There are just toO 
many reasons to want war with 
Iraq 10 let a little academic dishon-
esty get in the way. 

The most common arguments 
go something like this: Hussein 
allegedly gassed Kurds, "his own 

people," at 
I-Ialabjah, Iraq , in 
1988. T hat the U.S. 
Defense Intelligence 
Agency reported 
that the victims' 
corpses looked as if 
hydrogen cyanide 
lUlled them 

, 
flimsy. Military 
acrion in Iraq is 
not solely about 
liberating Iraq 's 
people; it is not 
solely about 
stopping the 
spread of 

something found 
only in Iranian gas 
during the Iran -Iraq 
War, whereas Iraq 
instead used mus-
tard gas - seems 
unimportant to the 
Bush AdminiStration 

NATIONAL 

nuclear or bio-
logical weapons; 
and it is not 
solely about 
gaining control 
of Iraq'S oil, 
though the last 
point is likely an 
important rea -
son for invading 
Iraq. More than 
anything, it is to 
save the United 
States from 
financial ruin. 

and the U .S. public. 
That the crime is 

" not 15 years distant and that it didn'l 
irritate the Reagan 
administration is 
also urumportant. 

Hussein is also 
suspected of mak-
ing weapons, which 
is another no-no. 
That the United 
States gave North 
Korea $95 million 

Quite simply, tile 
current popular 

arguments support, 
ing and opposing 

war in Iraq are tired 
and flimsy. " 

Many argu -
ments have been 
overlooked in 
the Iraq saga. 
We are never 
allowed to for-
get that Hussein 
allegedly 

for its nuclear program III April 
2002, according to the BBC -
not only after the "Axis of Evil" 
speech, but in doing so, also 
scrapped the clause from the 
1994 Agreed Framework that 
required inspections for 
weapons-grade plutonium - is 
also unimportant. And isn't the 
United States the only country to 
have actually used nuclear 
weapons against civilians? Again, 
unimportant. 

Quite simply, the current pop-
ular arguments supporting and 
opposing war in Iraq are tired and 

"gassed his own people" 15 years 
ago, but hardly anyone remembers 
what Hussein actually did in 
November 2000. It was then that 
Hussein stopped accepting U.S. 
dollars as payment for Iraq's oil 
exports. 

When Hussein made the 
move, the euro had declined 30 
percent since its January 1999 
debut and it didn't show much 
promise as a reserve currency. It 
took 82 cents to buy one curo. 
Radio Free Europe, one of the 
only organizations to report 
Hussein's switch, spent much 

effort trying to understand why 
Hussein would take such an eco-
nomic hit just to irk the United 
States. Later, he also converted 
his S10 billion U.N . oll-for-food 
escrow account to euros. 

Since then, circumstances 
have changed . The U.S. Treasury 
quietly shed ilS "strong dollar" 
policy in March 2002 . Almost 
Immediately, the euro began 
gaining on the dollar, moving 
well beyond parity in November 
2002 . It now takes about $1.09 to 
buy one euro. Essentially, 
Hussein has profited greatly from 
the switch, even after subtracting 
currency exchange fees, and may 
profit even more if the dollar con-
tinues to slide. 

CNN reported last year that, 
in light of political tensions with 
the United States, North Kora 
ended dollar-denominated trade 
on Dec. 1,2002. Other countries, 
including Iran and Venezuela , 
have also consid~red switching to 
the euro as their reserve curren-
cy. 

At this point, kdisaster" for 
the United States is not a military 
attack from Iraq. Rather, it is the 
possibility that other nations -
specifically nations of the 
Organization of Petroleum-
Exporting Countries - will fol -
low Hussein's lead and switch to 
euro-denominated trade 
accounlS. 

OPEC has considered replac-
ing the dollar many rimes in the 
past, especially during dollar 
weakness. The most recent revival 
of those considerarions happened 
at its April 14, 2002, meeting in

Love: Romance stories don't portray relationships' difficulties, truths 
contmued from page 4 

work out the way we want it to. 0 
one ever tells us what happens when 
Cinderella gets bored of being a 
princes or has a fight WIth her 
prince, because that could never 
happen . In happily ever after, there 
are no arguments. VVhat about 
when the world Stops fading away 
when Josie kisses am? No, that's 
impossible. Passion and love never 
fade or change. What happens to 
Buttercup when \.Vesley can't give 

up pirating and starts loving his 
gold a little more than her? Oh 
wait, that would never happen, 
either. 

In popular media, we never see 
what happens Ilfur the credits start 
rolling. We never see the fights, the 
end of constant passion, the sexual 
ruts - any of the problems we all 
know real people have. Love, even 
if we think it is perfect in the 
beginning of a relationship, never 
stays perfect or the same for long. 

People grow and change as individ-
uals and relationships change, too. 
But since that never happens in the 
movies, or the love songs, or the 
romance novels or the fairy tales -
which are blueprints for the perfect 
relationship - we think our own 
relationship should work that way 
as well. 

It is unreasonable to expect that 
our own lives and relationships will 
look just like the movies or any of 
the other media forms that tell us 

what love should be. Love isn 't an 
instantaneous reaction to meeting 
your soul mate. Love is a process -
something you have to earn and 
work for. So don't get upset when it 
doesn't just fall into your lap like it 
always does for Meg Ryan. And 
there is no happily ever after. 
Relationships always require work, 
understanding and change; saying 
"I love you" doesn't make every-
thing all better and every problem 
go away. 

So this Valentine's Day, if your 
partner doesn't get you the perfect 
present, if the world doesn't fade 
away when you kiss, if he can't get 
off work early or she doesn't say 
exactly the right thing - get over 
it. Your relationship will never be 
perfect, and it will never be a movie 
or summer romance novel. But · if 
you learn to drop the impossible 
expectations set up for us by the 
media, our relationships can be 
something even better: real.

pain. 
A dollar is worth a dollar large-

ly because it is the international 
standard in oil transactions. If 
OPEC nations were to suddenly 
switch to the euro and divest 
themselves of U.S . dollars, the 
sudden glut of dollars on the world 
market would force the dollar to 
drop even further and quicker 
than it already has. The quick 
inflation of the dollar would cause 
even more foreign investors to 
abandon the U.S. stock markets 
and dollar-denominated assets, 
Simply to retain what value 
remaills. 

At home, a run on the banks 
could follow. Eventually, current 
U.S. deficits would be unservice-
able in devalued dollars and the 
nation would go into default. The 
nationWIde social upheaval result-
ing from a currency collapse would 
pose a far greater problem for the 
government than crying !O clean up 

a bombed U.S. city or military 
base. 

By conquering Iraq and 
installi ng a friendly regime, the 
United States will be able to guar-
antee that Iraqi oil exports are 
again dollar-denominated. A mili-
tary victory would also communi-
cate to OPEC the possible conse-
quences of a switch to the euro. 
Any switch would be made at the 
other nation's peril. 

In fact, by gaining control of 
Iraq's oil production, the United 
tates can also increase production 

to the point of breaking OPEC. 
Currently, OPEC sets producoon 
quotas and price controls to ensure 
maximum profits. lraq now oper-
ates at two-thirds of its capacity, 
producing about 2 million barrels 
of oil per day, according to the 

ational Review; a new govern-
ment could produce triple that 
WIthin three years. If Iraq's oil is 
mainly directed to the United 
States, we need less 011 fr!'m other 

DOMINO~S DELIVERS TO UCSDI 

OPEC nations, meaning OPEC 
will lose its dominance over U.S. 
oil imports. If Bush's gamble on 
Iraq succeeds, we can enjoy more 
oil for less money, at least for a 
while. 

" By conquering Iraq and 
installing a friendly regime, 

the United States will be 
able to guarantee that Iraqi 
oil exports are again dollar, 

denominated. " 
The United tates quickly and 

predictably punished Iraq in the 
Per ian Gulf \Var. It could happen 
again soon . However, a currency 
collapse would not be as easy to 
conquer. 

Do You Need 

Our economy can ha ndle a 
gradual shift away from the dollar 
as the world's reserve currency, but 
not an abrupt one. The world can 
topple the United States' hegemo-
ny whenever it wants to, simply by 
abandoning the dollar standard en 
masse. This has not happened 
because other countries recognize 
that the disadvantages sti ll out-
weigh the benefi ts of doing so. But 
many countries are becomi ng 
more wi ll ing to flee from U.S. 
assets, especially as the dollar con-
tinues to lose value. Our govern-
ment is rightly afraid that more 
countries may soon abandon the 
dollar. 

Knowing this aspect of the Iraq 
problem helps one understand why 
the Bush Administration so 
adamantly pursues military action 
in Iraq, despite dome ·tic and inter-
national objection. The alternatives 
appear less attractive and less pre-
dictable than a war with Iraq . Right 
now, it is more acceptable to pursue 

the war at all costs than it is to 
admit the flaws in our monetary 
system and either fix them or let 
the system collapse from those 
flaws . 

Indeed, one of the goals of the 
Constitution is to "ensure the 
domestic tra nqui lity." Not sur-
prisingly, a war in distant Iraq 
seems as if it would provoke less 
unrest in our country than a 
domestic currency crisi s. Our 
Constitution also states that it 
intends to "secure the Blessings of 
Liberty to ourselves and our 
Posteriry," but not to anywhere 
else in the world . It belongs to the 
United States first, period. If a 
foreign war helps keep our COUIl-
try internally calm, It is OK With 
the Constitution; any quarrels 
with deities, morality and the like 
are legally irrelevant. And Imow-
ing this angle should give i)oth 
pro- and anti-war Americans .1 
lengthy pause to dllnk about our 
furure in Iraq and at home.

Coverage of student's 

death was flippant 
Editor: 

Since my first week here at 
UCSD, one irksome factor I have 
noticed is that Tht UCSD Guardian 
tends to pay little attention to 
major issues and instead focuses on 
hollow, crass issues. The final straw 
was drawn when I came upon the 
article about the death of a srudent 
at Pacific Hall (Feb. 10 issue). 

Less than one-fourth of a page 
was dedicated to the distressful and 
much talked-about incident. 
I Iowever, in the same issue, the 
Guardilln staff easily devoted a 
whole page to whether or not an 
ice-cream parlor should be added 
to the Price Center. Clearly, the 
staff members seem to think that 
editorials on an ice-cream parlor 
seem to vastly outweigh the impor-
tance of a death on campus. How 
insensitive. 

Even more, the article about the 
death was, to my disappointment, 
poorly written . The facts are 
ob cure and leave readers with no 
closure. The writer reported that 
"staff members" found the body -
which staff members? How many 
staff members? What was their 
reaction? Were there any witness-
es? Did someone see Summerfish 
fa))) I mean, the "apparent suicide" 
occurred in broad daylight, at a 
time when numerous people were 

out and about in Pacific I [all -
didn't anyone notice something? A 
scream) A sound? Also, since 
Summerfish's death was not offi-
cially declared a suicide, I fear for 
many. What if there is a homicidal 
maniac roaming around, waiting to 
push people off buildings? 

Maybe there was not sufficient 
time to obtain all this information, 
but for a university that disuibutes 
a newspaper only twice a week, I 
am sure a couple of true, passionate 

" The staff members seem 
to think that editorials on 
an ice cream parlor vascly 
outweigh. the importance 
of a death on campus. " 

- Shiela ~=11e College 

writers could do more research for 
such an important ordeal. A sru-
dent died - is that all there is to 
say? 

[n addition, on the econd page 
of the Guardian, under the "Lights 
and Sirens" column, (which, may I 
add, is incorrectly dated), the 
Gllnrdio11 indicates that at I: 13 
p.m., "officers reported a death at 

The Guardian we/comes letters from Its readers. All let-
ters must be no longer than 500 words, typed, double· 
spaced and SIgned with nome and bIle. We reserve the 
nghl 10 edit (or length and clarity. Letters may be 
dropped off at the Guardian office on rhe second floor o( 
the Student Center Of e·mailed. Send all letters to 

Pacific Hall." Yet, in the article, 
writer Thomas Neeley describes 
that according to a sergeant of the 
UCSD Police Department, 
"Summcrfish fell to her death at 
about I p.m." So this means that 
within a matter of 13 minutes, the 
body was found, the police were 
called and Summerfish was 
declared dead. Thirteen minutes) 
Wow. 

Now, having been an editor of 
my high school newspaper, one 
mechanism that was very important 
in article writing was getting 
quotes. We were taught thaI since 
the paper is for students, student 
input is extremely essential. Quotes 
draw more student readers, which 
is the purpose of a student newspa-
per. Yet I find a great lack of quotes 
in many articles, especially in the 
"Student found dead a t Pac. Hall" 
article. I, along with hundreds of 
other Revelle freshmen living on 
campus, live right next to Pacific 
Hall, and our thoughts and con-
cerns should be expressed. Muir 
students, many of which knew 
Summerfish, should have been 
interviewed as well, but weren't. 

[ am not writing in regards only 
to the Summerfish article, but about 
the Guardilln as a whole. 
Unquestionably, the paper lacks sub-
stance and a sense of importance.

Stop: A few topics can apply all the time 
cOlllinued from paRe 5 

part. I grasp at conversations that 
I've heard, or brief chunks of arti-
cles I've read, or a small rambling 
on the part of one of my profes-
sors. The reason for this is that 
religion and politics really bore 
the hell out of me. 

I don't read newspapers or 
watch the II o'clock news. I don't 
subs ribe to the Wall Smtt JourTllll, 
nor do [ enjoy poli tical cartoons 
wi lh Illy coffee for breakfast. I don't 
eat breakfast; I rarely wake up 
before noon, and when [ do, ['II 
have ome fountain Colre at my 
local drive-thru that defaults to it 
because Coke in a can isn't nearly 
as good. Coke in a bottle is a sepa-
rate joy altogether, but since it's 
rather expensive for a mere 8-
ounce bottle, [ try to reserve that 
for special occasions. 

I find that people who discuss 
religion and politics, especially at 
lunch time, are annoying. They 
interrupt a perfectly good bagel 
and cream cheese. I had a really 
good bagel oncc. [ went "all out" 
and got a bagel with lox alld lox-fla-
vored cream cheese. The double 
salmon really did the trick. 

I lave you ever noticed that peo-
ple who dISCll~~ religIOn and poli-
tiCS aren't really discusslI1g religIOn 
and pohllcs at alP It's usually this 
pseudo-lecture with a Iccllircr and 
a lecruree. The lecnlrer is guing uff 
abolll something he read In that 
lIlornlng's paper or heard on that 
Il1orn'ng's talk show, and the Icc-
turce IS SOrt of noddll1g with 1115 
cye\ glued over rc.lltzlI1g why thl'

ment and American hi tory. Then, 
when the time comes for me to 
speak, I 'll somehow relate whatev-
er it is they were talking about with 
either: 

a) Manifest destinyllmperialism 
b) What a bastard Nixon really 

was 
c) ome speech about how it 

isn't a waste of a vote to vote 
Libertarian, which [ heard fTom 
one of my fricnds once and nodded 
a lot during 

urprisingly, you can relate any 
one of these three topics to what-
ever anyone ever says about poli-
tics; much the same way you can 

" Have you ever noticed 
that people who discuss 

religion and. politics aren't 
really discussing religion 
and politics at all? It's 

usually this p eudo,lec, 
ture with a lecturer and a 

lecturee. " 
relate any literature topic to 
" I [allllct," "Brave cw World" or 
"19B4." 

RehglOn, on the other hand, 
seems lC) be more of a taboo sub-
jeer. Even those who dronc on 
about poltucs stay away frolll It 

bccHl~e they know It's touchy With 
some people. The only real thll1g 
people can diS uss are commonly 
accepted crackpot religIOns Itke 
SCientology, a opposed to selec-
tively accepted crackpot religion; 
Itkc hnstianiry. But then al:,rain, 
there's only ;0 many lItlles you CJn 
ulk about alien rulers named emu 
anti projecting Images of Je,us 

Chri t and Tom Cruise and 
Giovanni Ribisi before the whole 
subject becomes as tired as the 
original religion debate. 

ThiS IS why [ would never sub-
ject my readers to an entire column 
about religion or politics, or much 
worse, a combination of the two. 
Because I don't know a damn thing 
about either. But that's not the only 
reason. Even if [ knew something 
about one or the other, I wouldn't 
write about it. I know a hell of a lot 
about relational databases and Web 
programming, but you don't see me 
writing column about them. 
Because they're boring. Because 
they're not interesting. Because 
columns are not influential. 
Becau e even if they were, you 
wouldn't see any of the results of it, 
because the only responses you're 
going to get are people writing in 
aying, "Nope. Didn't convince 

me. This is how it actually is .. ... 
These people are not cool. But let's 
bend reality and pretend that

Muir: Senators hear constituents' concerns 
conunued from page / 

they would have even more difficul-
ty gernng to class on time than they 
currently do. 

"It's nor Just an Issue of com'e-
nience, it' a maner of academics, 
and that 's whv we're all here In the 
first place,'; said ophomore 
Senator Jeremy Cogan. 

Senators brought up the Idea of 
orgaruzmg a student protest in the 
Price Center to show the adminis-
tranon their opposition. 

"So far, the sentiment with park-
ing IS that we can't do anything 
about It, and that students don't 
have any choice ... but I'd like to see 
students stand up," Hart said. 

"the other main item in the 
forum discus ion was the possibility 
of seeing spending limits for stu-
dent government elecoon cam-
paigns taken away in the wake of 
the UC Santa Cruz lawsuit which 
could lead to all UC campuses tak-
ing away spending limits. 

"There has been quite a battle 
in A.S. lately as to whether o r not 
we should eliminate them before 
we are told that we have to, or if 
we should stand up and fight 
against it," Hart said . "The Muir 
senators have taken a stance that 
we should fight against it and keep 
our spending limits as long as po -
sible." 

If the university requires them 
to take away spending caps, the 
senators said they would be 
required to comply, but didn't want 
to take away limits preemptively 
"Out of fear." 

"To back down in advance 
would be basically showing that 
we're JUSt not going to put up any 
fight on behalf of the students," 
Cogan said. 

Several students suggested that 

if the limits were to be eliminated, 
that sena tors should look more 
clo ely into what individual cam-
paigns can pend on. Other sugges-
tions taken Into consideration 
included limiting where campaign 
posters could be displayed. 

"It's really nice to hear that stu-
dents are totally for campaign 
spendmg limits," 11art said. "' Vhen 
)'Ou think you're for it, you don't 
necessarily know if all the students 

" Proponents are saying 
that it's going to make a 
colorbUnd society ) but 

what. it does is it makes 
. ." an Ignorant soaety. 

- Jeremy Cogan. John Muir 
College SophOmore Senator 

are for it, too." 
The A.S. Council will be 

addressing the recently reintro-
duced campaign spending legisla-
Don at next week's meeting. 

Senators went on to discuss ref-
erendum possibilities for the expan-
sion of the Price Center, asking stu-
dents whether they would be will-
ing to pay an addition $25 to $30. 
Some student brought up the con-
cern that additional fees would be 
badly timed in the wake of the rise 
in campus fees and parlcing tickets, 
among other student expendirures. 

The selllltors said they would 
look into students ' adVIce that 
buildmgs that would be sponsored 
by student fees should be owned 

by Associated Students. 
Suggestions for what to include in 
the renovation of the game room 
included healthy restaurants and a 
barber shop. 

I ndividual senators from each 
class also discussed their personal 
projects. Hart is currently working 
to consolidate a central location on 
campus for snldents victim of sexu-
al a ault. Cogan and John Muir 
College Freshman Senator am 
B\Il are working with the CRENO 
initiative, which is slated to appear 
on ballots in March 2004. 

"Proponents are saying t1,at it's 
going to make a colorblind society, 
but what it does is it makes an igno-
rant society," Cogan said. "You 
won't know what the diversity of 
your school is, hospitals aren't 
going to know what certain groups 
are more susceptible to certain iU-
nesses, etc." 

Cog-an is also planning on 
improving StudentLink by finding 
ways to make it resemble the stu-
dent service Web sites of other 
universities which offer a cus-
tomizable display. Also, he is hop-
ing to improve student spirit by 
malcing the Triton more apparent 
as a mascot. 

~ If you look at SnldentLink, or 
if you look at just anythi ng at 
UCSD, our mascot is always the 
library, and we 're not the UCSD 
Libraries, we 're the UCSD 
Tritons," Cogan said. "lnat's a lit-
tle thing, but these little things can 
have a big impact on the big picture 
of school spirit." 

It was also mnounced that due 
to a conflict in programming, the 
date for Muirstock could be 
switched from April 25 to April 18. 

The public forum was brain-
stonned and organized by Gui. 

Remembered: Friends, family grieve 
continued from page / 

Sophomore and friend Gabe 
Kreb remembered sharing a visual 
arts class with her. 

" atalie would create incricate 
wire scul ptures, and did great stuff 
that blew me away," Kreb said. 
"She was an arnst." 

Kreb and Yaghouni also 
remembered Sum merfish think-
ing up riddles and posting them 
on her roommates' doors , reward-
ing them with candy bars for cor-
rect answers. 

The Muir college adminiscra-
tion and the campus Psychological 
and Counseling Services staff have 
been working in coordination to 
respond to reactions from Stu-
dents who may have been affected 
by the loss of Summerfish, 
deploying suff to Pacific Hall on 
Feb. 7 and providing ongoing ser-

vices in order to reach out to any-
one who wishes to come in con-
tact with them. 

"Our main response is to be 
available to individuals, but also, 
colleges will identify a group of 
people who want to talk and we 
will come over," said Interim 
Director of Psychological and 
Counseling Services Reina Juarez. 
"Hopefully, more people will 
come out for help. We are avail-
able for any son of fonnat and to 
anyone, regardless of whether or 
not they knew Summerfish." 

Muir College Dean of Student 
Affairs Patricia Mahaffey said that 
she expects students to react on a 
number of levels, despite whether 
or not they knew Surnmerfish or 
are in the process of grieving, con-
cerned with another one of their 
own friends, or have lost someone 

in the past themselves. 
"I think it's fair to say that all of 

us here on this campus are affect-
ed by this tragedy," Mahaffey said. 
"We are all deeply saddened by 
the loss of someone so young and 
so bright." 

Psychological and Counseling 
Services encourages anyone to 
contact them at (858) 534-3755. 
Counselors are on-call 24 hours a 
day and are available after office 
hours through campus police by 
calli ng (858) 534-HELP. 

For questions or concerns 
regarding suicide, Psychological 
and Counseling Services also rec-
ommends visiting the Jed 
Foundation's Web site at 
http://1J!'W'W.uJifi/illt.org or calling 
the San Diego County Mental 
Health Crisis Line at (1800) 479-
3339. 

Parking: Spaces to make way for building 
conunued from page / 

native transportation measures 
and possible rescrictions on park-
ing demand," said Transportation 
& Parking Services Director and 
TPC Execuuve Secretary Greg 

nee. 

Specifically, the TPC will be 
discussing the Implementaoon of 
parking rescrictions for freshmen , 
conscruction of both temporary 
and permanent parking facilities , 
and increased incentives for use of 
alternative transportation pro-
grams, according to Chapman. 

"Tne feeling I got at the last 
rrCP] meeting was that freshman 
parlcing will be restricted in some 
way next year," Chapman said. 
"To what degree I don 't lenow." 

In addition to the option of 
completely barring freshman 
parking, the TCP might also diS-
cuss implementing a lottery or 
need-based rescriction on fresh-
man parking, Chapman said . 

The T PC will be loolcing at 
these options during its March 
meetings. 

In a 2001 report on "UCSD 
Transponation and Parking 200 1-
06," the TPC "concluded that It 
would be preferable to resO'lct 
freshman residents from parlcing 
on campus because this is a policy 
that has been implemented suc-
cessfully at many ca mpuses 
around the country and because it 
offers the best option for ensuring 
reduced demand from the popula-
tion of on-campus residents." 

According to the report, an 
estimated 1,230 parlcing spaces 
would be freed if freshmen re 1-
dent parlcing was restricted. The 
report found that UCSD had a 
to tal of 14,144 permit and meter 
parlung spaces at the end of the 
2000-0 1 academic year. 

The repon, designed to rec-
ommend administrative measures 
that would "ensure a suffiCient 

parking supply, increase the scope 
of ... transportation options and 
preserve the financial integrity of 
the transportation and parking 
system," also recommended the 
conscrucuon of two new park.ing 
structures and the expansion of 
alternative transportation pro-
grams and bicycle networks. 

UCSD adopted these recom-
mendations, among others, last 
year and is LO implement them 
over the nen five years, according 
10 T & PS. UCSD is also to 
determine this academic year 
whether parlcing res tri ctions 
applicable LO freshmen should be 
Implemented next year, according 
toT & PS. 

Planning for two campus park-
mg structures IS underway, accord-
1I1g to T & P ,and the first truc-
ture, scheduled to be occupied by 
the 2004-05 academic year, WIll be 
located on the northwest corner of 
Ilopions Drive and VOigt Lane.

Freeze: Senator calls 
Warren spending 'frivolous' 

concinued from fXtge / 
Lee said that the freeze is not 

the product of any questionable 
funding practices but rather to pre -
vent the council, as has happened 
in past years, from overspending 
the budget. 

According to the 2002-03 fig-
ures , WCSC's operating budget is 
$18,179, which is made of a 
$12,035 A.S. allocation and a 
$6,144 vending machine allocation. 

Lee said the vending machine 
allocation, which is income derived 
from the ca mpu ' vending 
machines and divided among the 
college councils, has not been 
received yet. 

In addition to the delayed vend-
ing machine allocation, Lee blames 
what he calls a "rather inadequate 
accounting system." 

"It's just really hard to crack 
money that goes in and out of the 
accounts," he said. 

Povieng said that outside of the 
vending machine allocation, pro -
grammers delayed notifying the 
creasurer of having used allocated 
funds. These delays contributed 10 
the council's books being behind. 

"The funding freeze is a good 
thing," Lee said. 

However, not all members in 
WCSC are as satisfied about the 
self-imposed funding freeze. 

"I think that it is unfortunate 
that we are putting such a burden 
on outside organizations when our 
financial situation is our fault and 
not theirs," said Kirsten Bowen, 
Warren college sophomore senator. 

In addition to the funding 
freeze, Bowen cites what she calls 
"frivolous internal spending" on 
items such as food for meetings, a 
one-day bowling alley recreat held 
in addition to the traditional fall 
retreat, and promotional giveaways. 

Janelle Benterou, WCSC vice 
president internal, said that the 
council made internal expendi-
tures, which is money allocated to 
programs run directly by WCSC, 
believing that more money was 
available than what turned out was 
actually there. 

"We anticipated having more 
money in the beginning of the year 
than we actually had - having it 
last longer," Benterou said . 

During fall quarter, WCSC 
allocated $405.31 for mess balls, 
$565.56 for frisbees and $604.54 
for zipper wallets, which were all 
emblazoned with the WCSC logo. 
These expenditures cost a total of 
$1,575.41. 

Lee said that the amount spent 
on internal expenditures is unrelat-
ed to the funding freeze . 

Internal expenditures are made 
by an executive board comprised of 
the council president, internal and 
external vice presiden ts, treasurer 
and parlamentarian, according to 
Lee. Internal spending is not pre-
sented before the council. 

"Whenever we spend money, we 
discuss it as a council," Lee said. "I 
don't see any problem whatsoever." 

Povie ng defended spending 
money on the items, which he says 
will last for three years. He also 
cited the council's decision to eek 
greater publicity of WCSC's pres-
ence. 

"When you go out on the lawn 
and see people playing with 
WCSC frisbees, they look at the 
frisbee, and they know that when-
ever we put o n an event or when -
ever we have some sort of formal, 
they know that it is snldent coun-
cil," Povieng said . 

Former WCSC PreSident J esse 
Coward said last year's council, 
which was iniD aJly more conserva-
tive with its spending during f311 
quarter 200J, might have benefited 
by promoting the counci l's name . 
Ncar the end oflast year's council, 
Coward said WCSC was faced 
with a large amollnt of money sti ll 
unallocated. 

"We had too much money at 
the end of the year, so we would 
have dOlle well to spend more," 
Coward said. 

Comparatively, neither Revelle 
nor Muir nor Eleanor Roosevelt 
college councils, which operate 
with larger budgets, spent money 
on promotional items . 

Revelle College Council oper-
ates with a $41,000 budget. This 
amount will increase for next year 
due to a new $7 per student , per 
quarter fee increase, according to 
RCC Chair Alex Schafgans. 

Muir a llege Council manages 
a hefty opera ting budget of 
$94,850, due in large part to a fee 
increase. MCC hair Nick 
Lieberknecht said that in terms of 
internal expenditures, council 
members at Muir buy thei r own 
council T-shirts, volunteer to bring 
snacks to meetings and even held 
their retreat at a council member's 
house this year. 

"I think in general, most college 
councils are careful with spending 
money on themselves," 
Lieberleneeht said. 

According to the WCSC bud-
get, the council held its fall 
overnight recreat in Jul ian, Calif., 
at a total cost of $1 ,858.23 . 

"This amount is in line with 
previous years," Povieng said. 

Last year's council spent 
$2,603 .63 for a fall overnight 
recreat at YMCA Camp Surf in 
Imperial Beach , Cahf., according 
to Coward. 

Povieng said that Warren col-
lege, at the encouragement of the 
dean's office, was looking into a $3 
to $5 per tude nt, per quarter fee 
referendum as a way to IIlcrease the 
budget. 

Thurgood Marshall College 
and Eleanor Roo evclt College 
students al a recently passed per 
quarter fee referenda.

the fact that the ufllversity failed to 
recognize the presence of minori-
ties on campus, so the need for a 
separate graduation was necessary. 
Strong also narrated an account of 
when UCSD students protested for 
a cause and marched to the 
!.nterstale 5 freeway, literally block-

Some students in attendance 
sta ted that there is a lack of 
activism at U SO. 

"I don't dunk there is enough of 
I t," said junior Mar hall student 
Dwayne ullivan. "There I~n't a big 
e nough pre~ence lof black stu-
dents], and I think It would be dif-
ficult to create more student 
activi m. People are n't afraid; they 

just need to come together." 
Bennie Ilerron, a keynote 

speaker from San Diego State 
University, noted that students 
need not have powerful leaders to 
guide them through channeli ng 
their beliefs and expressing their 
rights. 

The essential component of cre-
ating effective student activism is 
merely to corne together and sear h 
for what one believes in.

ove IS in the air, or at leas it's sup-
posed to be. So we here at the 
Guardian set up twO luc!..y si~les t.o 
go on a luxurious blind date. l\latch-
making experts brought together 

twO of the mo,t comparible people in the UCSD 
dating pool and sent them out on an ali-expens-
es-paid excursion, mcluding dinner at the Olart 
l louse and a romantic limo ride. 

Smooth-talking Danny Shapira waltzed IIll 
the GunrdlfTll office dressed to the ni nes and pre-
pared to sweep his blind date oR' her feet , carry-
mg a gorgeous bouquet of violet roses. With 
hopes for a good Dme with a girl wi~ ",a healthy 
seme of humor," Shapira described hiS Idt.'31 date 
and his hopes fur the evening. 

The arti tic, sitar-playing Shapira described 
his perfect date as "with omeone that I'm total -
ly comfortable with ... starting off drinking some 
Wille, having a good phi losophica l conversaoon, 
gOlllg out on the LOwn, h.avmg di~er, then .end-
ing by high-energy dancmg, late mght, unol we 
almost collapse." 

' Inc fifth-year 1- am major said that when It 
cnmes to relationslups, he's "probably not [look-
Ing for] a long-tenn rclaDO~shJP ~or no~v, but 11 
could bloom into that. A datlng-friendship could 
possibly mrn into a long-term relationship if it's 
really that speCial." 

The born romantic described himself as "a 
prctty laid-back lcind of guy, like, I'm into yoga 
and meditation and that kind of thing. I'm hop-
ing for tonight that we can have not just a super-
ficial conversation, and that we can delve deep-
er." 

This soulful, meditative guy was looking for a 
fun and romantic girl, and described himself as 
having a "sense of humor Ithatl ca.n be :acky at 
times; it can be very dry at lother] Dmes. And his 
date must have been glad to know that. 

Who was the lucky lady fortunate enough to 
be the object of his affections for that ev~ng? 

he was the lovely Valerie Giuili . Also a sen.lor 1-
Carn major, Giuili is a fun-loving blonde who 
said that her ideal date would be "a fun ome that 
doesn't have any pressure. ometlung that c1iclcs 
between us without even realizing it ... JUSt get-
ting to lenOW each other." . 

Perhaps they did not have the exact same Idea 
of a greal date, but their intere ts and personali-
ties definitely seemed like a mat h. . 

"I'm really sarcastic. I'm really laJd back, cre-
ative ," Giwli said of her herself. But unlike 

Sittine pretty: valerie and Danny get comfortable, relax before heading out to dinner at the Chart House 
and pose for the camera in their compitmentery itmo. 

hapira, she was loolcing for something just a lit-
tle bit different out of this date: " I'm not rcally 
loolang for a n!lation hip. I just thought this 
looked interesting, this little conte t thing, and I 
just thought about doing it .. . just for fun." 

We'll see ju t how well they got along toge th-
er ". 

At 9:30 p.m., the happy couple came. back 
into the GUllrdiflTl o ffice smiling and laughing, a 
good sign that dlings had gone well - either 
that, or they were really good at hiding what they 
felt. 

hapira had only positIVe things to say about 
his date, stlrting with a pleasant first impression: 
" he was really cute. She had a nice mile. he 
seemed a little nervous, hUI so was I, so we had 
that in common." 

iui li was also pleased With her first blind 
date ever. 

"It was fun. I had a great ume. 1 was expcct-

ing the worst ". I thought he was cute. I didn't 
like the way he dressed, [though]. I didn 't like his 
shirt. 1 have more conservative ta t es," she said. 

But despite the unappealing wardrobe, Ius 
personality and his manners more than made up 
for anything that at first seemed undesirable, 
according to Giuili . 

"It went really well ," Gluili aid. "There were 
no awkward silences. We talked the entire time 
about random topics." . 

This definitely came as a pleasant surpn e 
after expecting the worst. To be honest, she was 
afraid of being set up with "someone really des-
perate who saw this e-mail and got really exCit-
ed," an oblivious 18 YC1lI-old nerd who was too 
preoccupied with school. Instead, her date "was-
n't tOO nerdy" and was "really intelligent and had 
the same major as me, which ISn't bad." 

When asked about their date, hapira had

may turn to desperate measures. 
That's right, it may be ome for 

the personal ads. 
Personal ads are 20-word com-

mercials for the dateless and want-
ing. Like all commercials, per on-
als must be taken with a grain of 
salt because, after all, these people 
are selling thm1Selvrr, and they do 
not have much room to reel you in. 

For the solo, Friday nights can 
be a night of bitterness. Everyone 
else is out with their respective 
others, having their respective 
fun, and those alone have the 
options of cleaning out the 
"green" in the back of the refrig-

But, for the bitter and alone, 
thiS Friday will be wor e because 
it's compounded by the fact tha t 
everyone else is out with their 
respective othcrs engaging in 
romantic activities . Sure, you 
could wine and dine yourself, but 
it's hard [0 get that lovey-dovey 
feeling nuggling in front of the 
fire by your lonesome. 

So the bitter and alone who 
wPnt a warm body on this, the 
Friday night of all Friday nights, 

Reader: beware. 
On the surface, personal ads 

are light and innocent. Just 
remember there arc real, single 
people behind these seemingly 
harmless ads. 

It's a crazy world out there.

We all celebrate the JaffU! IwAdag 
Members of the LGBT community speak out about Valentine's 

ByUSAMAK 
Staff Writer 

Valentine's Day usually con-jures up images of hearts and chocolates, cute cards and 
romanoc dates thar culminate in a 
moonlit walk in the park. Yet this 
national holiday of love and 
romance may have more subtle 
meanings for those of the gay and 
lesbian community. 

"I don't know that there's qual -
ltaovely any difference at all ... in 
the ways that the holiday IS cele-
brated," said Shawn Travers, 
director of the Lesbian Gay 
Bisexual Transgender Resource 
Office. "The only difference is, I 
think, that people in the 
lesbian/gay community have to be 
more aware of how they express 
affection in public." 

However, John Muir College 
Housing Adviser Seth KJonsky 
sees no difference between how 

the two groups deal with the holi-
day. 

"Since most openly gay people 
living in relatively accepting com-
munities are al ready out and about 
as couples, Valentine's Day has 
become much the same holiday 
for .both groups - gay and 
Slralghl," said KJonsky, who is 
openly gay. 

A1iGe Johnson, a sophomore at 
Thurgood Ma.rshall College, said 
that .she and her girl friend cele-
brated V:llentine~ Day last year 
with SOWers and dinner. This 
yelr, ho~, they ave decided 
to forego the gifts and rcunance 
and go see "The Va~ina 
Monologues" instead. 

Although their ways of cele-
brating Valentine's Day may not 
be very different from those of 
heterosexuals, the views of the 
gay/lesbian community toward 
this day are more varied. Some 
feel that there is no difference in 

the meaning of Valentine's Day, 
while others see the holiday as dis-
criminatory against their sexual 
orientation . 

"I think a lot of people in the 
LGBT community would proba-
bly use [Valentine's Day) as an 
example of another way the 
'greater society is putting down 
the gay population,'" K10nsky 
saId. "On the other hand, r think a 
lot of people ... think of 
Valentine's Day as an excuse to go 
on nice, cute dates with their 
boyfriends and girlfriends just like 
everyone else .• 

Still others, like many in the 
heterosexual community, have dif-
!lrent views based on personal 
beliefs about the holiday. 

"I thinle I view [Valentine's 
Day) differently just because I

and 1 wrote a huge paper on it, so

Fun factoids about the origin of dating prac-
tices and other Valentine's cliches 
By HANAHSU 

Staff Writer 

A h, Valentine' Day, a day of exquisite pleasure and pain, when couples annoy the world 
with their especially public displays 
of affection, the single pretend they 
enjoy buying chocolate for them-
selves, and the desperate - er, 
smart - singles sign up for a blind 
date. But it wasn't always this way. 
In fact, if it weren't for the decapi -
tation of a priest, fun with whips, 
mating birds and Norman French, 
we might not have this special day. 
And you thought Valentine's Day 
was all hearts and flowers! 

Authorities have disagreed over 
the origin of Valentine's Day, but 
have pinpointed several possibili-
ties, some more choice than others. 

Hitting on Women 
On Feb. 15, the ancient Romans 

participated in 

" 

the Norman French word "galan-
tine," meaning gal lant or lover, to 
"valentine" may have caused people 
to think of Valentine as the special 
saint of lovers. 

Lovebirds 
How could Va lentine's Day be 

complete without the birds and the 
bees? Well, maybe JUSt the bi rds. In 
the Middle Ages, a coml11on 
English and French belief was that 
birds mated halfway through the 
second month of the year. Chaucer, 
and Shakespeare's writings along 
with other I4th- and 15th-century 
literature, allude to Valentines Day 
as the day for birds and people to 
express thei r love. 

Be mine, please? 
Whatever the origins, Valentines

the lades, often involving ways for

Other Valentine's Day CustolllS 
involved the females playing luck 
and dreams. Unmarried Engli sh 
women in the 1700s would pin bay 
leaves to their pillows on Valentine 's 
eve, a charm they believed would let 
them see their furure husband in 
their dreams. Some took a more 
Buffy-like approach and walked 
arowld the church at midnight 12 
times, chanting verses such as, "I 
sow hempseed. Hempseed I sow. 
He that loves me best, come after 
me now." 

Another, less gru me legend 
has it that St. Valentine was a man 
of learning and speei healing abil-

taught and healed nis jailer's blind 
daughter. She o:tly regained her 
eyesight when she opened the

VALENTINE'S DAY ISSUE .. 

Got a hot date? This must-have manual will 
make your special night memorable 
By MARA EVANS 
Senior Staff Writer 

A great date will have you all jittery from the get-go. Your palms sweat, your stomach 
cramps and you have to look at 
your driver's license to remember 
your own first name. The worst 
part, though, is trying to figure 
out how to best entertain that 
bodacious honey who has sparked 
your interest. If these problems 
plague you, it would 
behoove you to add 
the "Guide to G reat 
Dates!" to your 
bookshelf. 

" rcat Dates" 
is an informative 
but unusual guide 
to - you guessed It 
- great dates. Co-
authors Paul 
Joannidcs and Toni 
phnson have each 
b:en published 
btfore, Joannides 
m{J;t notably for the "Guide to 
Get-jng It On! " and Johnson for 
"Ha.ldcuff Blues," which is 
designed to help teens stay Out of 
legal trouble. The authors have 
joined furces to create an enter-
taining, if bizarre new guide. 

It's difficult for most normal 
people to come up with one spe-
cial idea for a date. [n "Great 
Dates," Joannides and Johnson 
have come up with 90. Sinj!c the 
authors have made no attempt tp 
categorize the dates, the compi-
lation of ideas resembles an edit-
ed version of a brainstonning 
session . Upon c10sce reading, 
however, it is noti<:eable that 
both authors have dedi cated 
themselves to their topics, pre-
se nting fresh ideas and helpful 
ti ps for their readers. 

The outings and activities 
suggested by Joannides and 
Johnson vary fr.om the mundane 
to the extravagant. The nllUldane 
side of the spectrum includes 
meeting for coffee, bird-watch-
ing, flying ki tes and shopping for 
antiques. Yet despite the appear-

ances of sure-fire boredom, 
Joannides and Johnson attempt 
to clarify how different people 
would enjoy the various dates. 
For example, the authors point 
out that "antique r.ar shows can 
be fascinating," and probably 
more entertaining for co ll ege 
students than shopping for items 
your grandmother would enjoy. 

Of middling date-excitement 
are very normal outi ngs, includ-
ing skiing, roller skating and vis-

itmg a museum or 
the zoo. J oannides 
and Johnson keep 
these sections inter-
e~ting by adding 
helpful hints on how 
to make the most of 
your time at any 
given acovity. The 
author even provide 
ti p on the besl way 
to dig a fire pit when 
watching a sunset 
from the beach. 

Perha p one of 
the most entertaining reasons to 
read "Great Dates" is for the 
eccentric and outlandish date 
ideas. These il1c1ude suggestions 
for making your own cordial and 
brewing your own beer, making 
your own volcano, and going to 
down school. The activity that 
will leave the greatest impression, 
however, is one where J oannides 
and Johnson suggest "molding 
111Jf' date," which involves taking 
Iiiolds of each other's body parts. 
i>h authors even include a sec-
tion about taking a mold of your 
da l'e's genitalia, but advise that lots 
o[ IubnC2nt be used to protect 
pubIC hair. Joannides and Johnson 
candidly add that "this might not 
be the SOrt of thing you'd want to 
suggest for a first date." 

Despite the wadciness of sever-
al date ideas, the "Guide to Great 
Dates!" covers all its bases in an 
effort to ensure tha t the reader 
will themselves at some POlllt 
score . If nOthlllg else, "Great 
Dates" is a fun-filled activity book, 
good for keeping any number, or 
type, of people occupied.

The ultimate, illustrated guide to steamy 
nights and unforgettable experiences 

By ROBERT SPENCER 
Staff Writer 

The "Guide to Getcing It On," a playhll yet informa-tive guide to sex, the 
human body and relationships, 
makes reading about such oft-
suppressed topics as masturba-
tion or sex during a woman's 
period eem almo t too silly to 
pass up. I (ow can one ignore an 
itemized list of the vulva's anato-
my when it's bullet-
cd with little coffee 

helps illustrate that its a strange 
journey from flaccid to erect. 

After some helpful tipS on 
romance, kissing and getting 
naked , Joannides gets right 
down to what we're here for. He 
starts by discusslllg the finer 
points of hand jobs - for men 
and women both - and their 
oral counterparts. Througnout 
the "Guide," comic book-like 
illustrations provide comedy and 
instruction through their explic-

it diagrams.

what about using a 
compass to desig-
nate orth on a

no lack of comedic 
sense in the people 
over at the Goofy 
Foot Press, the 
proudly wacley pub-
lishers of the

Getting

of the "Guide" is 
its decidedly het-
eronormative per-

specti~e on sex. In 
a nearly 70D-page 
text, a mere I I 
pages are dedicated 
to gay and bisexual 
Issues . Eleven 
pages! This hardly 
seems like a fair 
effort on 
Joannides' part to 

,. 
Paul J oannides, the book's 

author, begins the "Guide" with 
a disclaimer that states, "Just 
because some of [the contribu-
tors) have college degrees does-
n't mean they know any more 
about sex or sexual relationships 
than you do." These wise words 
pretty much embody the P,tr 
spective this book takes 'on 
everything, from chapter on 
" ipples, Nipples, Nipples" and 
"Dyslexia of the Penis" to JlIus-
trations of what look like zero-
gravity ejaculation. However, We 
can rest assured that ex~s 
were consulted when it CJme 
time for the "thorny" issues. 

The "Guide" begins slowl}' 
with about ix chapters of back-
grollnd info and foreplay before 
the down and dirty. These pre-
Urrunaries include fun new facts, 
such as the development of the 
tenn "clitoris" III the 1960s or 
that the favorite expression of the 
average 8-year-old child is "moth-
er-fucking, titty-sucking, blue-
balled bl tch." And fo r tho e VIsual 
learner, the Goofy Dick lame 

PeJ>Jl<rdIJ1<\ 
Gr~dll"l" xh,,,,1 
of EduClUOI1 

include homosexual issues in 
his concept of sexuality. This 
chapter seems more like an 
attempt to cover the author's 
ass than an honest considera-
tion of the matter. 

To his credit, Joannides does 
include other often-neglected 
issues ' the "Guide." A chapter 
titlt;d "Culrure & Kink" describes 
VarlOUS fonns of bondage, fetish-
es-, listing and more. And in the 
chapltr titled "Sex When You 
AreJiorny & Disabled," both 
10000tical and emotional issues of 
4isabled people are considered 
e.xtensively. Furthermore, a chap-

~r on "Sex Laws in the U.S." 
lP9ints out that the sale of VIbra-
tors is illegal in Alabama, Texas 
and Georgia (puni hable WIth up 
to a year of hard labor and a fine 
of S 10,000); and tha t there is no 
speci fic statute outlawing beast-
iality in Wyoming. 

Joannides and his associates 
seem ultimately to care about 
making sex a fun, comfortable 
clung in cultures that otherwise 
suppress sexuality at all costs. 

Confessions 
of a V-Day 

dumper

Dave Bynum 

Traditionally, the Valentine 's holiday has separated the world IOto two call1p~ ' those who 
spend their time desperately search-
ing for the perfect gift and place to 
take their loved ones, and alterna-
tively, those who dress up m all black 
and sit in their dorm room With a 
six-pack of Mike's I lard Lemonade 
and ponder what could have been If 
they could have Just bwlt up a little 
courage at that party last week. I 
wonder If there couldn't be a third 
group of mdlvlduals who spend 
Valentine's Day celebrating their 
freedom. Allow me to suggest the 
WlSuggestable: Dump your signifi-
cant other on Valentine' Day. 

If bemg III a relationship 
was a class, then Valentine's Day 
would be the final. It reqUIres a great 
deal of preparation, and afterwards, 
you are either going to breathe a 
sigh of relief that you didn 't screw It 
up, or you are going to pend a few 
days wondering whether or not you 
just wasted the past 10 weeks of your 
life . The thing that people often 
don't consider IS that they don't have 
to take the final; you can dump your 
significant other on Valenone's Day, 
and it won't even show up on your 
transcript. 

Its this kind of thinking outside 
of the heart-shaped box of c-andies 
that can rurn thi dreadful holiday 
mto one that you 'VIII never forget. I 
would also encourage those who 
plan on getcing nd of their mate on 
the most romanoc day of the year to 
put some careful planrung into how 
prcci ely to go about It. After all,

VALENTINE'S DAY ISSUE 

Cheap and eaJ'!: !aJl-minule Va!enline~ Dumper: 
Primed to 
breakup Gift ideas for the V-Day procrastinator 

By NEHA SINGH 
Staff Writer 

So ... you forgot that Valentine's Da), is coming up. Maybe you've been so 
caught up with your significant 
other that )'ou can barel), keep the 
dates straight. Or maybe you 
",ant to take thIS opporrunity to 
tell that per~on what you dunk 
about theIr great ass ... urn, we 
mean theIr personality. \Vell , here 
are some /rft Idea for those who 
JUSt don't know where to start. 

For Girls: 
Flowers! ruffed animals. Yes, 

it's a faIrly ob'lous choice, but 
you can nel'er go wrong. If roses 
are toO cheesy (or expensive), try 
a colorful bou-
quet of wild now-
ers, or any others 
that catch your 
eye. She' ll melt, 
and you'll come 
off as being very 
"s\\'eet. " 

Spa kits. Available at most 
beauty stores like Sephora, they 
will make her feel like a princess. 
If you really want to be a srud. 
pamper her yourself WIth the kit 
(you know you want to) . 

Fuzzy Slippers. She'll 
absolutely love them. They're 
comfortable and keep your feet 
warm. There are plenty available 
WIth Valenune's Day motifs this 
time of year. 

Poetry. Don't worry - you 
don 't have to write it. There are 
plenty of compilations on love 
available by poet~ like Ruml . 
Bonus POlOts if you write a little 
note to her on the inside of the 
cover. 

Dinner. It can be homemade 

or takeout that )'ou arranged 10 a 
picnic basket. Invite her to your 
place (don't forget to clean!), or 
take her to the beach . Either 
way, she'll be impressed. 

For Guys: 
Lingerie. H e won't even real-

ize you bought it for yourself. 
Everybody Ivi n . 

Baked Goods. Cookies, cake , 
pies .. . get creative "1th heart 
shaped molds, different colored 
frosting and sprinkles. Add a per-
sonalized touch by writing little 
messages on them. 

Boxer . They're available m 
almo tan), texrure and print, so 
you can be as craz)' or tame as you 
want. 

Massage. Light a few candle, 
gel ome lightly 
scented oils or 
lotions, and get 
working. Don't 
forget tense areas 
like the houlders 
and back. 

Phorogra phs . 
Put a picrure of yourself (or the 
twO of you) in a frame, and voila! 
Give it an individual touch by 
including something special like 
a dried flower you kept from the 
first bouquet of nowers he gave 
you. 

Unisex: 
AJ though most of these gi fts 

can work for the opposi te sex, 
here's a thoughtful gesrure: Fill a 
box lvim Her5hey~ KIsses. Tape 
one kiss on the lid,lvith a sign that 
says, wOur first kiss .. . ," and put 
another one inside the box that 
says, "And all the ones that fol-
lowed." If you can, spend some 
extra time decorating the box. Be 
prepared for a lot of real kJsses. 

San Diego's best V-Day date locales 
By KEELY HYSLOP 

Staff Writer 

I t's almost Valentine's Day, and the air is filled with the peaceful whisperings of "So, 
you takin' me out tomorrow or 
what?" It 's that time when cou-
ples get to bond together in the 
mutual anxiety of "Valentine' 
Day is this Friday and I haven'l 
made reservations." BUI fear 
not, there are other alternatives 
to the pandemonium because 
we're in San Diego, where the 
sunlight is abundant, the wild-
flowers bloom even in February 
and the ocean is only a breath 
away. 

One lOp pick for a romantIC 
evening on a Friday night 
would be La Jolla Cove . 
Watching the swirling 
turquoise waters break in eddie 
along the cliffs or perhaps sit-
ting down for a picnic; there's 
plenty of grassy areas adjacent 
to the coastline. Bnng a blanket 
and observe the seals pop in and 
Out of the waves at nearby Seal 
Beach. 

Get some ice cream ifit's not 
too chilly. Look out upon one 
of the most beautiful sunsets 
you've seen in a long time. 
Later, you can venture into 
nearby La Jolla illage and 
peek into the shops. 

Balboa Park is always a per-
fect place for any occasion. The 
place is overflowing with scenic 
paths and quiet corners to 
explore. The lily pond located 
just in front of the botanical 
gardens building is a personal 
favorite. On either side of the 
pond are large grassy areas with 
benches and fountains . The 
atmosphere is incredible after 

dark when the old Spanish 
Renaissance buildings are cov-
ered with strings of lights that 
do interesting things to the 
shadows. Moving west through 
the park towards the bridge 
after dark, one is offered an 
unparalleled view of the city 
and the Coronado Bridge, 
which can make the stars jeal-
ous. 

For students living on cam-
pus who don't want to stray too 
far from home, a nod must be 
made to the cliff as a classic 
spot for watching the ocean, the 
sunset or just moon-worship-
ping. The cliffs are located near 
the entrance to the cripps 
Marine Reserve behind John 
Muir College. It 's a lovely spot, 
although a little dusty and dark 
after nightfall. It serves as a 
good stop for a pm who are 
planning on spending a Jay or 
an evening barefoot at the near-
by La Jolla Shores. La Jolla 
Shores is also an excellent 
choice for a Friday evening 
because of its superior access (0 
beach bonfire pits. Be sure to . 
get to there early, and bring 
your own wood if you opt for 
this (0 be your plan for sweet-
heart recreation. 

There are many other places 
to go around an Diego that are 
only a short drive or a free bus 
ride away. Other places to try for 
a picnic or just a little romantic 
scenety are Mission Bay, Pacific 
Beach along the boardwalk, 
Torrey Pines State Parle, and 
many other locales that can be 
found on hup://www.Iignon-
sanditgo.com or similar recre-
ation-focused Web sites. A 
happy Valentine's Day to all, and 
to all a good night. 

can! in lied from page I I 
children someday. 

In the eighth grade, I had my best 
friend deliver a dead rose to my girl-
friend on Feb. 14 wi th a note tha tread, 
"You've just been dUlIlped." It is just 
that type of attention to detail that will 
turn a breakup into a catastrophe. By 
combining the use of a note and having 
a friend deliver it, I think that I really 
gOt the message, "you are not worth my 
time or energy," across. After all, isn'l 
that what a person is really ~ayih\:, when 
they dump someone on Valentine's 
Day? 

ometimcs a more effectiv. 
method is to pretend that you arc 
doing something great for th em, and 
then leave them utterly disappolllted . 
This will lead your mate to behcve 
that you are somewhat illcompelcllt, 
and after considering all the dlsap-
pointmcnt that you are sure to bnng 
them in the futurc, he or she ,viII 
probably dump you. This move IS I1ICC 
if you want to date one of your com-
panion's friends. For example, at age 
16, I talked up Valentine's Day all 
week and asked my girlfriend to come 
over wearing something rcally nice. 
When she arrived, I took her into my 
kitchen, where two root beers and a 
heart-shaped pepperoni pizza was 
waiting (3 piece was missing of course, 
for dramatic effect). The relationship 
ended the next day, and her best friend 
thought the pizza thing was "kinda 
cute." 

While I don't expect the majority of 
people to go Out and dump their mates 
on Valentine's Day, I do feel that the 
option houJd be seriously explored. 
The two-party system of being pathetic 
and lonely or enamored and frantic has 
got to end. Think of me as the Ralph 
Nader of love - I am just a third pany 
trying to broaden the hori7.0ns of cele-
bratory possibilities on one of our 
nations lIlost dubious holidays.

Couples can also opt to go to 
more upscale places WIth more

"I think the more upseale the

you're paYIng for such a high

"When you pay for a $300 dmncr

For couples who are not yet

romantic relauonshlp quietly IS 
not limIted to gays and lesbIans 
who have not "come out of the 
closet." The same analogy can be 
apphed to any couple that IS not 
speCIfically open about theIr rela-
tionship. 

One problem that the gay/les-
bIan corrununJty ml~ht face IS the 
commerClall7.3uon of Valentine 's 
Day, wtuch IS geared much more 
toward heterosexuals, who consu-
rute a greater percentage of the 
general population. Finding gifts 
and cards for a gay/lesbian part.ner 
may be harder than findmg one 

for someone who is slraight. 
"We have a very heterocentric

saId. "Only when it's from 'that

Valentine's Day may also take 
on a different meanmg for gays

"It was good. We had some good conver-

sa tions," he said. "It got deep; we got to 
know each other pretty well, pretty fast. We 
ta lked about everything: o ur past, our par-
ents, family, what we believed in ... She 
opened up and showed her true sel f." 

All of which pointed to a good date. 
One uncomfortable factor for Giuili was 

the posh setting. 
MI'm just used to a more laid-back sctting," 

she said. "I'm not used to going to expensive 
restaurants and doing the whole 'date' thing." 

But after the romantic dinner, the two 
lovebirds spent a romantic moment a[ the La 

Jolla Coves JUSt taking in the scenery and 
learning more about each other. 

And now all of you are probably dying to 
know what went on in the limo, right? Was the 
partition up? Well, too bad. Because as Shapira 
diplomatically explained lvith a laugh, "That is 
between me, Valerie and Angela [the limo dri-

So will our gallant young man ask our 
charming young lady out again? 

") thinlc so. I had a good ti me," he said. And 
thats all right, too, because she also said she'd 
go out lvith him again. Awww, how sweet. 

"I had a really good time - the Guardian

all wann and fuzzy inside.

San Diego Zoo presents erotic animal love lives in "Night Moves" event; watch nature's frisky, tender moments 
By LEORAH AVIDO 

Contributing Writer 

Male c rowned cranes, named for a yellow ruft of feathers on their heads, spread their 
wings , croak and dance around 
the female before mating. Some 
rhinos hang Out for two to four 
weeks before maring, swimming 
and nappmg together. ometime 
a female rhino in estrus presents 
her elf, wollen backside first, to 
the males, swaying and turning to 
let them know she' ready. One 
morning at the Wild Animal Park, 
animal keepers noticed muddy 
footprints and drool stain on the 
back of one of the ovulating 
females . he's had a busy night. At 
the San Diego Zoo, keepers 
noticed a female koala pacing 
around her bedroom, a female 
koalas do when they' re in estrus. 
The keepers let her out into the 
hallway leading to the other 
rooms, and she marched down the 
hall and sat down to walt out Ide 
of a male koala's bedroom door. 

Ammals court and mate with 
much success at the an Diego 
Zoo and the San Diego Wild 
Animal Park. The Wild Animal 
Park opened in the 1970s with the 
purpose of providing a breeding 

facility for endangered species. 
The an Diego Zoo opened in the 
1920s as a home for the exotic 
species left in town from the 1916 
World's Fair. The San Diego Zoo 
houses the largest collection of 
koalas out ide of Au tralia, and 
over 90 koalas have been born at 
the zoo. To date, successes at the 
Wild Animal Park include 90 
southern white rhinos , 0 g iraffe 
births and 40 Indian rhmo births. 
Hoof stock breeding at the zoo i 
so succe sful that many heifers 
and female gazelles are on birth 
control. 

Aher the young are born, and 
during pregnancy, no male koalas, 
rhinos or giraffes stick around to 
help their mates. Many species of 
birds demonstrate less typical 
male behaVIOr: The male ostrich 
its on the eggs for short periods 

of time whtle the female ostrich 
looks for food . The male horn bill 
gathers food for the female while 
she roosts. 1ale rhinos and 
giraffes leave the females alone 
during pregnancy, smelling the 
"unavailable" pheromones. 

Female rhmos, like female 
humans, have an estrus cycle that 
lasts 2 to 31 days. Three days a 
month, female rhinos are fertile 
and available for mating. If the 

male rhinos are around and sniff 
the females , they'll take the oppor-
tunity. Female pandas go into 
estru for two or three days a year, 
o male pandas have to be alert. Shi 

Shi, the an Diego Zoo's male 
panda, was not. A wound on his 
nose obscured his sense of smell, 
and he could not catch a whiff of 
the two females' pheromones when 
they were in estrus. hi Shi 
rerurned to the wilds of China two 
moths ago. Another male from the 
wild in hma, Gao Gao, arrived 
shortly thereafter to meet the 
females ' needs. He is now waiting 
in quarantine for a month until the 
keepers are sure he can acclimate to 
his new home at the San Diego 
Zoo. Gao Gao is nine years old and 
his sense of smell is intact. Zoo 
;ceepers hope that the adolescent 
panda can act when estrus strikes. 

~en e tru trikes a female 
koala, she pace on the ground, 
bellows and StOps eating for a few 
days. Some females seek out male 
koalas b), the scent the males leave 
on trees. Each male marks his 
home perch with his own scent, 
rentrning to sleep in that same 
tree each mght. Koalas do their 
mating 111 the trees. The female 
holds tightly to the tree, a nd the 
male hold on to her, pulling her

fur and biting her neck. The deed 
takes 30 seconds. The male relax-
es afterwards, and the female pulls 
away. Sometimes the male attacks 
the female as she retreats, chasing 
and biting her. Keepers at the zoo 
pull the koala couple apart if they 
starf to fight . 

A baby koala is born 29 to 35 
days later, without hind legs. The 
joey scrambles into the mother's 
pouch to develop for up .to six 
months. Upon emerging from the 
pouch, the joey is responsible for 
clinging to its mother while she 
climbs trees and eats. 

Female pandas guard their 
young with more maternal vigor. 
A female panda stays with her 
young for days at a time after giv-
ing birth, forfeiting food for her-
self and nursing her cubs. 

Researchers observe and record 
the behaviors of the giant pandas 
from various vantage points in their 
enclosure at the San Diego Zoo. 
The koala keepers see the koalas up 
clO e 111 their bedroom, behind the 
exhibit, where the bears sleep for 
20 hours a day. At the Wild Animal 
Park, the space is much more open. 
Keepers observe the animals from 
various vantage points around the 
park. Amani Point, not open to the 
public, which look out over the 

plains of North, South and East 
Africa, offers a simultaneous view 
of three distinct pans of the park. A 
flatbed truck takes guests on the 
Night Moves tour to Amani Point 
to see the animals at sunset. The 
sun sets on the San Pasqual Valley, 
and the animals become active in 
the cool evening air. The animals 
don't mind the time of day when it 
comes to mating, but the lower 
temperarures of the night iIlsplre 
amorous behavior. A lot of mating 
happens over night, and the keep-
ers find clues in the morning. 

The Night Moves tour, offered 
for Valentine's Day and again in 
June, July and August, showcases 
the Wild Animal Park's breeding 
facility for 21 and over guests 
only. The February tour starts at 3 
p.m . and lasts umil 6 p.m., after 
dusk. The Night Moves tour is 
the last to leave the park on the 
winter nights. In the summer, the 
tour lasts from 6 :30 p.m. until 
9:30 p.m. Liqueurs, coffee and 
dessert are served after dusk, dur -
ing a talk with a gllt!~t peakcr 
about animal courtship and breed -
ing. On the ride back to the heart 
of the park, couples slluggle clos-
er, relaxed and iIlsplred after three 
hours ou[ in nature in the back of 
a pick-up truck.

in league play. 

On Feb_ 8, the Tritons matched 
up with ASU, despite missing sev-
eral key players due to injuries. This 
was of l ittle importance, however, 
because the Tritons notched the 
first score and maintained a strong 
l ead throughout the game_ Jessica 
V enturi led the Triton offense with 
a pair of tries and a phenomenal 
game of passing and crashing . 
Defensive regl.llator Jolene Sawyer 
devastated AS U's offense along the 
right sideline, while Kat Hartl led 
the forward pack with strong ruck-
in g and support. The Tri tons took 
the game 41- 15. 

The followin g day agai nst the 
Wildcars. the T ri tons went back 
t o work_ Allowi ng onl y one score,

UCSD in home tournament 

conunued from page 24 
However, VCSDs defense held on 
to esca pc wi th the victory. 

UCSD began tournament play 
on Feb. 8 with its first defeat of the 
season, a 5-2 loss to UCSB . The 
lrlton defense held the Gauchos in 
check with thei r press but failed to 
capitali ze on offense, gOing o nly 
one-for-six on power-plays and 
scoring JUSt two goals on 19 shots. 

UCSB scored carlyon in the 
game to take a one-goal lead, which 
soon vanished in the s(.'Cond quarter, 
courtesy of Paulson's equalizer. The 
Gauchos responded With two goals 
before the end of the half and then 
added two more scores in the third 
period to put the game out of reach. 

"We had some confidence after 
[Paul on's l goal tied things up, but 
a we continued to be pressed and 
pushed out, we los t that edge," said 
UCSD head coach Larry Sanders 
about the lack of offensive fire. 

In its next game, U SO found 
itself matched up against Cal Baptist, 
a team they previously beat this year 
10-3. This time, however, the game 
was more competitive, since the rwo 
teams furiously traded goals 
throughout the contest, which even-
tually ended in a 10-8 UCSD win. 

Paulson led the UCSD scoring 
with four goals and Co-captain 
Dana Tucker had rwo goals of her 
own. 

Feb. 9 proved to be the tunl-
around day for the Tritons. The pre-

vious day's mistakes were cleaned up, 
and UC 0 came out hot. 

"Today we m ade a s tronger 
team effort," said Boyle, referring 
to the second day of the tourna-
ment. "After losing to UCSB, we 
weren't going ro lose any more 
ga mes in this tournament." 

VCSD played against confer-
ence ri va l UC DaVIS on Feb. 9 and 
defeated the Aggles 5-4. Paulson 
once agai n played a pivotal role, 
scoring two goals in the first quar-
ter to give the Tritons a 2-0 advan-
tage. Danielle Bourret and Tucker 
each added a goal to give UCSD a 
'I-I lead going into halfome. 

The Triton defense allowed few 
scoring opporrunities for the Aggies 
in the final 1:33 when UC DaVIS was 
only a goal behind. 

In the final matchup against 
Bakersfield , UCSD dominated the 
Roadrunners throughou t the game, 
winning by a score of 8-5 . Tucker 
and Paulson each added two goal 
to a high -powered offcnse that 
scored six goals before halftime. 

Sanders ummed up his take on 
the tournament. 

"We had some key wins - it sets 
that momentum and it makes a 
statement: 'Hey, you have to beat 
us!'" he said. 

At the end of the competition, 
Long Beach State, LMU and DSU 
stood atop the standings, but Long 
Beach took home the crown with a 
6-5 victory over LMU.

In the second game, the Tritons 
were defeated 4-2, giving starter 
sophomore Keri I JanJcy her second 
loss of the , eason, even though 
UCSD out hit the Cators 9-8. 
Batista continued to hurt the 
Tritons, sconng two Il.UlS and hit-
ting a home run, and so did team-
mate I lolly Pcarce. Aggahao and 
junior Amy Mcnee both had two 
hits for UCSD, and Aggahao addcd 
two RBis to her team-leading total. 

"San Francisco has really 
improved, but these games served 
as a good learning experience," 
Gerckens said. 

The e victories marked the 
first time sll1ce 1981 that UC 0 
has lost to the Gators. 

The Tritons turned it all 

around when they travel ed to 
Sonoma State, though, and they 
won their first game on Feb. 8 by 
a score of 4-0, giving sta rter Bland 
her third win for the season and 
bringing her record to 3- t. 

This ome, all the offense 
belonged to UCSD, since Bland 
kept the Scawolvcs to just four ruts 
while getting twO strikeouts and 
going 2-for-3 at the plate. Menee 
went 2-for-4 With a horne run, and 
Aggabao added three hits and three 
RBis. The Tntons scored a run 
both in the fi rst and third innings, 
as well as two 111 the seventh inning. 

"We put thc hits together, and 
just really came out ready to play," 

Gercken~ said. "We made the 
most of o ur opporruni tiCS, dnd 
playing like that after two tough 
loses rcally hows how much char-
acter and heart the girls have; 

wc're just going to keep learning." 
The second game against 

Sonoma tate was even better for 
the Tritons, who won 10-0 111 the 

'fifth inning after the mercy rule 
was invoked. II anJey threw a near-
perfect game for UCSD. a no-rut-

On Feb. ,Dao and iddiqui 
played against Claremont College 
in the most challengll1g match so

one game, neither Side led by 
more than one game until UCSD 
led 6--1 ; however, Claremont 
quickly came back to even the 
score at 8-8. T he Tritons won the 
tie breaker, 7-5 , to win the set. 
Dao later played Becca Dunon in 
what would become the longest 
game of the day, with Dao and

With rivals Cal Poly Pomona

Schneider said . "It 's going to make

SclUleider said the Triton golf

Rabbit-
catching 

fever sweeps 
UCSD 

From the 
Front Row 

Bryce Warwick 

F or the ake of argumcnt, let's say that my roommatcs are on a que t to catch a rabbit. 
For the sake of argument, let's ay 
they've dcveloped various traps and 
strateglcs to accompli,h thiS goal. 
For the sake of argument, let' say 
the core is: rabbits 5, roommates O. 

H'hde my call to the UCSD 
Police Department YJclded no rea-
son why such an actl\~ty could be 
Illegal, there are rumors of the rab-
bitS being a protected species on 
thiS campus. For the ake of argu-
ment, that's why the rabbit-catch-
Ing expedioons would take place 
late at rught. 

Fear nol, animal lovers - we 
mean no harm to the rabbitS. I say 
"we," but I've yet to experience one 
of these Imle adventures. My room-
mates, "Mikey" and "Hezekiah," are 
the expert rabbit catchers. Or should 
I say, they're very experienced in try-
