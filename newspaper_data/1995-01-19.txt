Dental X-Ray. Can 
Predict Stroke. 
LOS ANG ELES - Research-
ers at the Veteran 's Ad rnini tra-
tion UCLA School of Dentistry 
have discovered a new method 
of identifying possible stroke 
sufferers among otherwise 
asy mptomatic patients. Dr. 
Arthur Friedlander claims t at 
routine panoramicdenral X-rays 
are able to identify plaque 
buildup in the arterie leading to 
the brain. "We' re telling doc-
tors to look in n~n-dental areas, 
to make sure that there is not a 
non-dental problem." Of particu-
lar interest to doctor is the ca-
rotid branch. which is the most 
common artery involved in 
strokes. Friedlander said how-
ever, that dental X-ra s are only 
the first step in the diagnostic 
process.

Truth About. Craig's 
Resignation Revealed 
A.S. : Former V.P. External 
was asked to. resign for failing 
to mail voter registration cards 
By Nina Boughton 
Staff Writer 

The Associated Students admitted this week 
that one of the main reasons for former Vice 
President of External Affairs Jennifer Craig's 
resignation was her negligence in sending out 
six completed voter-registration cards which 
were found in her office after the state voter 
registration deadline. 

A.S. representative to the University of Cali-

fornia Student Association, Naomi Falk said the 
affair had not been made public because she did 
not want the mistake to damage the external 
office's reputation. Falk added that she did not 
want to hurt students ' confidence in the voting 
process. 

According to Falk, a member of the A.S. 
external staff found six completed voter regis-
tration cards while cleaning the external office 
during the first week of November, about two 
weeks after the state voter-registration deadline. 

Falk said she spoke with a lawyer who rec-
ommended that the A.S. mail in the cards and

First Lady 
Will Speak at 
Roosevelt 
Dedication 
CEREMONY: Rodham-
Clinton to address college after 
postponing in October 
By Karen Cheng 
Senior Staff Writer 

First Lady Hillary Rodham-Clinton along 
with other distinguished guests, is scheduled to 
give the keynote address at the Eleanor Roosevelt 
College dedication ceremony next Thursday, 
Jan. 26. The ceremony will take place in the 
main arena at RIMAC, from 4 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. 

Clinton rescheduled her visit to UCSD after 
the ceremony wa postponed in October when 
she received a personal invitation to attend the 
signing of the peace treaty between Israel and 
Jordan in I man, Jordan. 

Eleanor Roo evelt College Provost Ann Craig 
said that while the college still wanted to have a 
dedication in October, they decided to wait for 
the possibility that the First Lady would honor 
her invitation. . 

"We decided that the expectation among our 
students was so high and the excitement so great 
that we cou Idn ' t go ahead and hold a dedication, 
because it would feel very disappointing. So we 
postponed and rescheduled the date, and now 
we couldn't be more pleased that Mrs. Clinton 
will be joining us for the dedication of our 
college," Craig said. 

Clinton was invited to speak at the Eleanor 
Roosevelt College ceremony because she has 
publicly identified with Eleanor Roosevelt. 

" It has already been well-known that Eleanor 
Roosevelt was a person Mrs. Clinton greatly 
admired, as an individual, and as a public woman 
quite ahead of her own time. And I believe she 
greatly respects Eleanor Roosevelt 's position 
on a number of issues of social and public 
policy, and in some respects, she might perhaps 
adopt some elements of Eleanor Roosevelt's 
style in being First Lady. We also thought that it 
would be one way of drawing attent ion to the 
college as the first institution of higher learning 
in the country named after Eleanor Roosevelt " 
said Craig. 

Cli nton is similar to Eleanor Roosevelt be-
cause she is a progres ive thinker for her time, 
and provides examples of strong leadership es-

Co-op Offers a Better

SURVEY: CALPIRG reports that University Book-

By H •• ther MeR ••

The University Bookstore is con-

versity Bookstore and $64.31 at the 
General co-op. 

"If you are looking to sell back 
your books then you are also look-
ing at a beller deal with the co-op," 
said Wesselman. Both the co-op and 
the University Bookstore have the 
same policy regarding books that 
are brought back. If the book is to be 
reused by the class in the next quar-
ter, then a higher return price is 
offered, as opposed to a book that 
can not be used again. 

The General Co-op offers 75 
percent of a book's original price, if 
it can be reused in the next quarter. 
The Bookstore offers 50 percent for 
the same book. For books that can 
not be used again, the co-op offers 
20 percent of the original price, 
whereas the University Bookstore 
offers a floating rate between 0 and 
30 percent. 

"The basic reason [for the lower 
prices) is because we mark up our 
books less. Our mark-up is 22 per-
cent on books, generally," said Josh 
Hall, a member of the General Co-
op who worked with CALPIRG on 
the survey. 

Hall said that the General Co-op 

the booKstore pays 
the university for services such as 
accounting, offices and police pro-
tection. These services comprise 
two percent of the overhead.Turk 
added that the bookstore is quite 
close to the national average of 5.5 
cents per dollar for store operation 
costs. 

"The bookstore pays its full ride, 
it does not receive any subsidies, 
nor should it," said Turk. "The 
store's income is very close to break 
even." 

According to Hall, the fact that 
the General Co-op does not carry 
books for all classes or full book 
orders for any class, also helps keep 
its prices lower. The co-op carries 
approximately 20 percent of the 
books for an enrolled class, unless a 
class orders exclusively from the 
co-op. A list of available textbooks 
can be found at the General Co-op. 

"We have a few departments we 
traditionally carry. The main six 
science departments, psychology, 
and math," said Hall. 

Turk agreed that a full load of 
books does effectively raisetheover-
all costs of textbooks. "[The Uni-

UC Regents Falsely Label 
Peltason as a Hero 

As reports circulate that University of California President 
Jack W. Peltason will announce his resignation after his Ihree-
year tenure, many of the UC Regents have congratulated him 
for a job well done. They have described him as "a quiet hero" 
who has brought "stability" and "wise counsel" 10 Ihe university. 
Even the worsl critics among Ihem could only summon up a 
meager "passive" to describe his faults. Perhaps the Regents 
felt the need to be conciliatory pecause of the budget crisis, 
which Peltason had to face as he took the helm of the nine-
campus UC system. 

However, it is easy for the Regents to gloss over mistakes 
when they are minimally affected by the consequences. IfUC 
faculty and students were to evaluate Peltason's performance, 
it is doubtful that anyone would mention the word "hero" or 
"stability. " 

In his three years as president, the university experienced 
the worst financial crisis in its 127 year history, losing 
approximately $300 million}n state revenues. For two years, 
UC staff and facuIty were denied raises, and in the third year, 
they received a 3.5 percent cut. Student fees increased by 
approximately $1 ,000. 

Some believe that Gov. Wilson' s new proposal to establish 
four years of appropriations for higher education is a sign that 
Peltason has lead us into a period of stability; however, when 
a 10 percent fee hike is part of the plan, stability hardly seems 
like the appropriate description for Ihe UC' s current situation. 

When Peltason leaves office, the budget problem will only 
add to the other crises which he will hand down. The projected 
population of students entering the UC system is the largest 
since the Baby Boomers went to college in the 1960s, forcing 
the UC to open Ihree new campuses. Yet, because of tbe fiscal 
crisis, Peltason had to delay the construction of a new campus 
already in the works in Merced, and no others have been 
proposed. The UC system is entwined in a vicious cycle, the 
state cannot afford to run the campuses it already has and it 
does not have the money to generate new growlh. 

There is one action which Peltason can take to leave the 
university in better condition than that in which he found it. 
Instead of accepting a huge severance pay, as did his predecessor 
David P. Gardner, Peltason should use his own "wise counsel" 
to remain within the lines of economic decency. 

It is true that Peltason was handed a difficult job in a 
beleaguered system; however, this in itself should not be an 
excuse for ineffeciency, but a chance to reform the university. 
According to the L.A. Times, Peltason was hired to be "a 
caretaker president for a difficult time." However when 
Peltason 's record is taken into account, this "quiet hero" is 
better described as a captain abandoning his sinking ship. 

Thumbs Up to UCSD 
Student Naomi F alk ... 

for reaching finalist status for the position of student regent 
on Ihe UC Board of Regents. The only finalist from UCSD, 
Falk would be the sole student representative at Regent meetings 
for the entire Uc. With fees skyrocketing at a frightening rate, 
we sorely need someone who is willing to fight for students-
and ultimately, Ihe integrity of the UC system. 

FaIk, who is currently serving as UCSD's University of 
California Student Association and Student Affirmative Action 
Committee representative, is an excellent choice for the position, 
with her interest in prioritizing underrepresented students and 
getting the UC budget under control. 

Though the role of student regent is a difficult one with 
many responsibilities, Falk seems to be qualified and confident 
in the issues she wants to tackle as a regent, such as preserving 
affinnative action and leveling off fees. 

The Guardian wishes Falk luck in winning the position. She 
would serve us well.

A CHAIN OF DISASTER 
WILL BEFALL You 

COMMENTARY: Chain letters grab our attention with 
forecasts of doom of biblical proportions 

By Jenny Unci 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Unfortunately, e-mail is anotber address where you 
can receive the electronic equivalent of Penny Saver 
coupons, ads for steam cleaning carpets, and - chain 
letters. 

This letter informed me that an Argentine mission-
ary had started the chain, and for some reason it had 
to circle the world. Apparently, if it didn 't, the seas 
would boil , the locusts would swarm, the Republi-
cans would take over Congress, or some other catas-
trophe. 

One letter I received informed me 
to send 20 copies out or take my 
chances invoking the ire of the forces 
of evil, as previous skeptics before me 
had irresponsibly chosen to do. 

"Don't pay any attention to it. Throw it away." 
Throw it away? Throw it away? And risk the wrath 

of the gods? I don't remember what I did, but the ma-
ternal lesson in cynicism clearly registered at some 
point. 

My theory on chain letters is that they are actually 
circulated, not by Argentine missionaries, but by bored 
employees. At my office (when I had a real job), we 
would occasionally receive a chain letter. One not only 
asked us to forward the letter, but also requested that 
we send as many business cards as we could send to a 

dying child whose last wish was to ap-
pear in the Guinness Book of World 
Records for having collected the most 
business cards. 

The letter listed several individu-
als who, disregarding the letter, had 
met with grievous luck. Buford 
Boudreaux was fatally struck by light-
ning in Louisiana. In Florida, Linda 
Honeysuckle's accountant stole all her 
money. Hiram Liebowitz of North 
Dakota lost his wife in a tragic blimp 
accident. Thelma Hoosenbacher had 
car trouble in Tennessee. (fhey didn't 
mention Bill Clinton, but what else 
could explain his luck?) 

1IIe letter had 
to circle the 

My first thought was that someone 
facing death should have other priori-
ties. But, touched by the dream of a 
dying child, and delighted to work for 
a cause that could distract us from our 
jobs, my co-workers and I hastened to 
spend company time gathering busi-
ness cards and sending out copies of 
the letter to our unsuspecting suppli-
ers. 

On the other hand, the letter cheer-
fully informed me that people who 
obeyed the instructions and sent out 
20 copies suddenly found their lives 
magically transformed. They met the 
people of their dreams, received stun-
ning promotions at work, won the lot-
tery, or inherited a stacks of cash from 
obscure relatives. 

I remember the first time I received 
a chain letter. First of all , being a 
young child, I was thrilled to have re-
ceived any letter at all, and thus treated 
it with appropriate gravity. After I read

didn't, the 
.... would 
boll, tile 
locusts would 
swarm, the 
Republicans 
would take 
over Congre .. , 
or some other 
catastrophe. 

Several months later, I was amused 
to read that the retter was racing around 
the United States, that business cards 
were arriving at the kid's home by the 
truckload, and that the entire story was 
actually false. I don 't remember if he 
was actually sick or dying, but he 
begged people to STOP sending him 
the damn cards! 

When I receive chain letters, I re-
gard the invasion of my peace of mind 
as equally malicious. Yet, the feeling 
lingers that I may be tempting fate. I 
am enraged by the thought that if I was 
suddenly hit by a truck after tossing a 
chain letter, people would nod their 
heads knowingly and whisper, "she 
should have sent that letter oull" 

the note that warned me of the mayhem that would 
soon enter my life, my eyes widened in terror. I asked 
my mother to take me to a Xerox machine, pronto, or 
I'd be dead by sundown. 

Her blase reaction to my plight stunned me. "That 's 
just a silly chain leiter," she laughed affectionately. 

After I deleted this most recent chain letter from 
my e-mail, I was musing about what forces of doom 
might befall me. I'm sure the possibilities are endless, 
but at least I don't have a (real ) job or spouse to lose, 
which seemed to be the most common theme of mis-

PRO-LIFERS ARE NOT ALL EXTREMISTS 
Editor: 

I was surprised by the lack of 
bahince in your recent commentary 
("Homicidal Tendencies and the 
Fetal 'Crusades, '" Jan. 9), as I had 
been led to believe that the Guardian 
was above making the kind of rash 
slanderous &eoeralizations which are 
socommon in the mainstream media. 

I know actively involved pro-
lifers who do not advocate any kind 
of violence. But they do pray at 
clinics, offer alternative information 
to pregnant women, educate on the 
realities of abortion, find housing, 
maternity and baby goods for 
mothers who decide to keep their 
babies, and provide adoption 
counseling for those who don 't. 

The willingness of the media and 
Anna Vaisman to continue to 
pigeonhole pro-life Christians with 
John Salvi and all other abortion 
clinic murderers is a grotesque 
misrepresentation of the truth. 

Vaisman 's "pro-life" sources are 
radical extremists, out of touch with 
the true Christian pro-life cause of 
saving lives, not taking them. 

Pro-lifers are tired of the media's 
willingness to portray them as hate-
mongering terrorists who organize 
killing squads across the country. 
Vaisman only serves to perpetuate 
this kind of sordid slander. 

She notes the media assessment 
of Salvi as "fervently religious" and 
then dismisses it as "a moot point." 
Wrong. In fact, he was a loner, a 
fanatic who had recently disrupted 
and been expelled from a Catholic 
mass for ranting and raving about 
the wealth of the church. 

Salvi was obviously a falsely 
religious misfit, taking out his own 
sad revenge on the world at those 
clinics. And, contrary to Vaisman's 
faulty conclusion, "the rest of 
Christianity" does indeed take 
offense at this atrocity. Or did I miss 
the poll in which you surveyed 
Christians? 

Salvi was drastically misled and 
wrong in his actions. So is your 
portrayal of the mainstream pro-life 
and Christian community. 

These radical acts of violence do 
hurt the true pro-life effort, but not 
nearly as much as the media 
continually seizing on these rare 
exceptions to portray pro-lifers at 
large.

A.S. DId Not Mail Vot •

Editor: 

I am writing on behalf of the 
UCSD College Democrats and the 
College Republicans to express our 
outrage over the involvement of the 
A.S. external in the November voter 
registration drive. It has come to our 
attention that in the office of the 
former vice president external , 
Jenny Craig, a number of com-
pleted, unmailed voter registration 
cards were found. This demon-
strates, at the very least, total incom-
petence, and could be considered 
nothing more than voter fraud. 

As political organizations, we 
are incensed that an appointed AS. 
vice president could have so little 
respect for the civil rights of stu-

dents or citizens of this country. By 
not mailing the voter registration 
cards, Craig denied these persons 
the right to free speech and suffrage, 
and added to voter apathy. This cal-
lous disregard to the U.S. Constitu-
tion is deptorable. 

Last week, the Guardian re-
ported that Craig had resigned as 
vice president external, citing per-
sonal differences with members of 
the A.s. I am shocked that the A.s. 
has covered up the reality of why 
she resigned. 

I understand that someone in the 
AS. contacted the persons affected 
by her actions to apologize. This 
action demonstrated great character 
on his or her part. However, I be-

lieve that the student body should 
be aware of Craig's and theAS. 's 
actions, since it affects other or-
ganizations which register voters 
on campus. 

Craig's actions reflect not only 
on the A.S., but on other groups 
which try to register voters. I can-
not count the number of times stu-
dents have said to me, " I registered 
with X, but they didn ' t turn in my 
card." This is morally reprehen-
sible. Technically, the responsible 
party is guilty of a felony. 

How many people in this 
country are denied their right to 
suffrage by the callous act ions of 
other individuals? Why should 
anyone bother to register at all , if 
the voter registration forms don't 
have to be turned in? If political 
or non-political organizations can 
selectively choose which voter 
registration forms to mail , why 
should anyone take the time to 
answer 13 questions? 

Because Craig was appointed, 
the UCSD College Democrats de-
mand no less than a written apol-
ogy from all of the AS. Executive 
Council Board and the A.S. Coun-
cil to the entire student body. We 
will except no excuses. The entire 
Executive Council Board is des-
ignated to work as a group. Mem-
bers must accept responsibility for 
each other 's mistakes. The AS. 
Council is responsible as well for 
appointing Craig. I sincerely hope 
that the entire council realizes how 
truly tragic this entire situation is.

QUESTIONABLE SOURCE FOR 
QUESTIONABLE STATEMENT IS UNJUSTIFIED 

Editor: 
The letter which I wrote to you 

("Commentary Makes Questionable 
Claims," Jan. 12) was directed to the 
article by Derek van Hoften ("The 
Man With No Plan or the Great For-
eign Policy Scam," Nov. 14). I 
asked the quardian for an explana-
tion for stating that Iran is "work-
ing to produce nuclear weapons." 

Your response in the Jan. 12 is-
sue of the Guardian justifies van 
Hoften's statement by another " lib-
eral" and pathetic paper, the San Di-
ego Union-Tribune, which was 
printed on Jan. 5. 

First of all, the Union-Tribune 
article was written in Israel, a coun-
try which hates Iran. And, of course, 
senior Israeli officials are going to 
state that "Iran will have nuclear 
weapons ... in two years. " They 
would be ignorant if they didn 't. The 
Israelis would love to develop 
greater propaganda against Iran, to 
establish a larger level of hatred by 
Westerners against a peaceful coun-
try like Iran. 

I have yet to hear Afghanistan, 
India, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, 
Oman, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, 
Turkey, the United Arab Emirates 
or even Azerbaijan state anything 
about Iranian nuclear weapons . 
Consequently, I feel that the article 
in the San Diego Union-Tribune 
is written in an extremely bias 
fashion. 

Secondly, the article, which sup-
posedly justifies van Hoften's state-
ment, was written in the Jan. 5 is-
sue of the San Diego Union·Tri-
bune. It seems a little awkward that 
van Hoften's article, which I felt 
was fabulously and irresponsibly 
written, was printed in the Nov. 14 
issue of the Guardian. 

So, my simple and logical ques-
tion is: How can someone justify 
himself on or before Nov. 14, 1994

with an article which war written on 
Jan. 5, 1995? It is now tremendously 
obvious to me that his statement at 
that time had no justification. This 
is another prime example of liberal 
journalism at its finest hour - mak-
ing a statement which is totally and 
unquestionably fabricated and un-
true. 

Once again, I am kindly asking 
you to apologize to the Persians at 
UCSD for your irrational and bo-
gus statement.

Editors' note: The Guardian neither 
confirmed nor denied the validity of 
Derek van Hoften:S claim. However, 
based on the cited Union-Tribune 
artic/e, we believe to have suffi-
ciently demonstrated that the aUlhor 
did not "fabricate" the claim. Van 
Hoften made his initial statement 
based on an earlier Union-Tribune

quoted The Economist. 

Media Is \VroIC In 
DenouncIng Clinton 
Editor: 

• 

While television, radio and the 
newspapers continue to portray 
President CI inton in a negative light, 
it 's instructive to compare ~im with 
George Bush, Remember him? .No 
one seems to mention his name any-
more. 

To the shame of our country and 
the tragedy for the innocent people 
of I raq, it was Bush who ordered the 
carpet bombing of 100,000 people 
in rraq; this will not be forgotten. 

Clinton has wisely avoided this 
kind of destruction on the people of 
Bosnia. 

Unfortunately, Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin has chosen to follow 
Bush 's example, and not Clinton'S, 
in his was against Grozny, 
Chechnya. 

The other area where Clinton 
deserves praise, instead of criti-
cism, is his attempt to pass health-
care reform. Did Nixon, Reagan or 
Bush do anything to help the mil-
lions of Americans with no health 
coverage?

All other industrial countries in 
the world have health insurance for

The American people also have 
a sense of compassion. And as the 
number of our homeless seems to 
be increasing, the incidence of ill-
ness among the homeless and the

even more important. In this mat-

Falk Could Be Next Student Regent 
FlNAUST: Regents 
will choose one of 
three at Friday meeting 
By Marianne Vlell 
News Editor 

One of l1CSD's own may soon 
be representing over 150,000 UC 
students as a member of the Board 
of Regents. Naomi Falk, UCSD's 
current University of California Stu-
dent Association (UCSA) repre-
sentative, could be the next Student 
Regent to serve on the Board of 
Regents, 

Falk was chosen by her fellow 
UCSA members as one of three fi-
nalists last weekend at the UCSA 
meeting in San Francisco. 

The three finalists will be inter-
viewed by a Board of Regents selec-
tion committee at the Regents meet-
ing on Jan. 20. 

As student regent, Falk would 
attend monthly Board of Regents 
meetings, have full voting rights, sit 
on one ofthe Regents' committees, 
take part in discussion and have the 
power to make motions. 

As the sole representative of the 
student body directly to the Regents 
and the State Legislature, the duties 
and responsibilities of a student re-

spite the cost," he said. "So, if we 
have to order a book from Africa, 
Asia or South America we will , even 
though they are more expensive," 

gent are demanding according to 
Falk. 

"I plan on frequently visitingall 
of the nine campuses," Falk said, 
"to make sure that I am accurately 
representing the views of a major-
ity of the students. I will also make 
sure that I send out press releases 
and lellers to keep students in-
fonned." 

Falk, who is a psychology major 
in her third year at UCSD, said that 
her two main concerns as a student 

- regent would be the budget and af-
firmative action. 

"The budget this year is hor-
rific," Falksaid. "I'm very concemed 
that as the state has to cut funding, 
they're putting it on the students. 
They're privatizing the whole sys-
tem and that scares me." 

Falk said that she is also inter-
ested in preserving and promoting 
affirmative action programs. "There 
is a move to eliminate all affirma-
tive action programs," 

"Though minorities are still 
underrepresented on our campuses, 
those that are here are here in part 
because of affirmative action. Elimi-
nating those projects would be cata-
strophic," she said. 

"Underrepresented parents need 
to see that college is a possibility for 

said Turk. 
"The University Bookstore has 

weekly speakers every Wednesday. 
They also offer computer repair ser-
vices and beyond that, they sell com-
puterequipment and software," said 
Wesselman. 

Students can find a copy· of the 
survey at the CALPIRG office on 
the second floor of the Old Student 
Center. The survey will also be dis-
cussed at CALPIRG 's general in-

their children. We need to prioritize 
higher education and bring fees 
down to an affordable level," she 
added . 

The process by which student 
regents are selected is another area 
in which Falk sees a need for change, 
Alhough UCSA chooses the three 
finalists, the Regents make the final 
decision about who is chosen. 

"We're frustrated that we cau't 
pi~ our own regent. I think that we 
should be able to choose the person 
who represents us." 

Falk said that her role as student 
regent would have two key parts. 
"My first duty will be to reach out 
10 students on all ofthe campuses," 
she said. "I need to bring issues to 
the students and communicate their 
responses to the Regents." 

Falk said that she also wants to 
encourage the Regents to use t~e 
political leverage that they have. 

"The Regents have a lot of sway 
with the public and I want them to 
start reaching out to the public so 
that the public, will start prioritizing 
higher education," she said. 

"For instance, the head of the 
Republican Party in California is 
member of the Board of Regents. 
They have infiuence butthey choose 
not to use it," Falk added.

"~hat we are trying to do here is 
produce information for students 
buying books," said Wesselman. 

"We are an environmental, but 
also a consumer protection group. 
At the beginning of the year we did 
a bank interest rate survey for San 
Diego so students could see which 
was best for thei r needs,"

THE RIMAe SAGA 

Administrators portray RIMAe as a textbook 
example of student decision making. But many 

student leaders see RIMAe as yet another 
boondoggle in which students were ... 

BY FRANCISCO DEVRIES, 
FEATURES EDITOR 

A fter years of often bit-ter conflict between UCSD administrators and a host of student 
representative boards 

and student-run co-ops, many con-
tend that the university administra-
tion has a credibility problem. 

Following the fiercely contro-
versial RecreationaVIntramural Ath-
letic Complex (RIMAC) referen-
dum in 1988, Assistant Vice Chan-
cellor of Student Programs and Fa-
cilities Tom,Tucker called the elec-
tion, which approved RIMAC by 
less than 100 votes, "a classic ex-
ample of student decision making. n 

As the doors to the $32 million 
student-funded facility prepared to 
open earlierthis month, Tucker con-
tinued to tout the student involve-
ment in the planning of the com-
plex. 

"That's the nice thing about this, 
it's not like any other kind of project. 
Students have final say," he said. 

On the surface, the claim has a 
lot of merit. During the construction 
and planning of the project, only 
student RIMAC committee mem-
bers were allowed to vote. Students 
voted in an election to asses the $70 
a quarter fee and build the complex. 
A student-run board, the Registra-
tion Fee Committee, now has au-
thority over RIMACbudgetary mat-
ters. 

"[The RIMAC] committee is the 
only committee in whole country . .. 
that include[d] such extensive stu-
dent involvement," said former 
UCSD student and RIMAC Com-
mittee Co-Chair Paul Lanning. 

Yet many students, according to 
A.S: President Carla Tesak, "harbor 
resentment" over the way in which 
RIMAC was brought to campus. 

"[The administration] can claim 
that students 

like a 

over the multi-million dollar stu-
dent-funded university centers bud-
get two years ago, the administra-
tion disbanded the board and formed 
a new, more hospitable one. 

'One year earlier, during the bit-

and the student-run co-ops, the ad-

ministration 
blocked the A.S. 
from helping to 
fund the coopera-
tives 'legal defense, 
despite the 
council ' s vote to 
allocate $5,000 to 
the cause. 

Accordingto re-
cent UCSD gradu-
ate Eli Rabani, these 
examples show 
that, "up to a point, 
there can be a little 
bit of [student] in-
put, but [student 
boards] are ulti-
mately at the plea-
sure of the relevant 
administrators. n 

Tesak agreed, 
saying that "there is 
student input [only] 
on the superficial 
things." 

This, says Larroque, could force 
steep cuts in registration fee-fundod 
student services such as the Student

The deficit exists 
because the RIMAC 
budget projections 
were made prior to 
the university's bud-
get crisis and enroll-
ment projections for 
the UCSD were 
higher than has actu-
ally occurred, ac-
cording to Tesak . 
With fewer students

The Registration 
Fee Committee is 
also financially re-
sponsible for provid-
ing a $300,000 
RIMAC reserve 
fund, ~ccording to 
Larroque, which 
would bring the total 
deficit to almost one-
half million dollars.

Co-Chair Doug 
Willen said that,

while the student-dominated com-
mittee was granted wide latitude to 
make decisions, ultimately, "all uni-
versity committees are advisory to 
the chancellor." 

"In a formal sense, [student au-
thority] could never be in more than 
in an advisory sense .. . that's how 
the UC works," Willen added. 

"The way they arc 
looking to make that up is in faculty 
and staff buying memberships," 
Tesak said. 

However, although the RIMAC 
budget is formally under the juris-
diction of the Registration Fee Com-
miUee, administrators originally set 
the membership fee at $50 per quar-
ter without consulting students, ac-
cording to Tesak, and Larroque.

The RIMAC referendum and the 
way in which the university handled 
its legal challenges have added to a 
long list of complaints about what 
some students view as thwarted stu-
dent authority. 

When student University Cen-
ters Board (UCB) representatives 
contested the university 'S authority

sult of lower-than-expected enroll-

"That decision had been made 

without any consultation to the Reg

When the decision was made,

RIMAe: Just 
who controls the

cantly less than us?" 

Larroque and the committee 
eventually looked into the matter,. 
and have raised the faculty and staff 
rate to $55 per quarter. The new fee 
will not go into effect until Spring 
Quarter, however. The committee 
also called for the faculty and staff 
rate to rise at least as fast as the 

charge faculty and staff, and over 
who gets to make such decisions, 
brings to light an obscure qualifica-
tion that was included in theoriginal 
RIMAC referendum text. 

All authority over the "funding 
and operation" of RIMAC was 
granted to the Registration Fee Com-

minee, and the UCSD administra-
tion is obligated to follow its recom-
mendations "except in extreme cir-
cumstances. " 

According to Willen, Vice Chan-
cellor of Undergraduate Affairs Joe 
Watson "insisted on" including the 
qualification in the referendum text. 
Although Willen "tried to identify 
and specify to what degree students 
would control the facility," he said 
he never understood precisely how 
"extreme circumstance" was defined. 

Lanning, however, said that the 
clause is a necessary "safety net to 
prevent a catastrophe from happen-
ing" in the event of an emergency at 
a time when the committee cannot 
meet. 

Whether necessary or not, the 
somewhat ambiguous qualification 
has added to the confusion over just 
how much control students have over 
RIMAC.

$5 fee increase wbicb is scheduled 
for every five years. 

According to Tesak, there is little 
chance that students would have ever 
seen any relief, even ifRIMAC was 
not already operating in the red. 

"I would honeslly say (a fee de-
crease] is never going to happen. 
That's just trying to appease the 
students. That's almost an outright 
lie," she said. "I don 't see that fee 
going down ever." 

According to Rabani , since the 
complex has already been buiIi, and 
the fee instituted, it might be pos-
sible for a student now paying the 
facility fee to ask the courts to inter-
vene and deassess the fee. 

"How likely that is, is an alto-
gether separate issue... I don't see 
anything in the works to do any-
thing about it," he added. 
Fln_cl.1 AId 

With the fee "set in stone," and 
the courts an unlikely option, atten-
tion has shifted to how to assist 
students who might have trouble 
paying the extra $210 a year. 

Administrators and some student 
leaders assured nervous students 
during the 'RJMAC fee referendum 
debate in 1988 that financial aid 
would be increased tocoverthe$210 
per year fee, 

The informational brochure pub-
lished by the RIMAC Committee 
prior to the 1988 referendum prom-
ised that, if "fees are increased, so 
are UCSD financial aid budgets and 
packages." 

But the brochure failed to state 
how the increase in financial aid 
packages would be paid for without 
reducing the total number of pack-
ages. Then-A.S. President John 
Edson said that he was not con-
cerned about the impact on finan-
cial aid because, "In the past, the 
pool for financial aid has expanded." 

However, the Consultant to the 
Assembly Subcommittee on Higher 
Education Chris Cabaldon wrote to 
student leaders that "many students 
are being told that the pool offinan-
cial aid funds will increase to cover 
the proposed fee increase. In virtu ~ 
ally every case, this is patently false ," 
. According to Acting Director of 
Student Financial Services Ann 
Klein, while individual fi nancial aid 
packages have been increased to 
reflect the $21 0 mandatory RIMAC 
fee, there has been no increase in the 
general financial aid budget to cover 
the new fee, 

"[The RIMAC fee) came out of 
our ex isti ng pot of money, " she said. 
The M ....... of RIMAe 

Tucker dismissed student com-
plaints over perceived administra-
tion meddling in student authority 
over RIMAC. . 

"I've never seen a project yet 
where students were going to pay a 
fee and we didn't have a period of, 
quote-unquote,controversy, follow-
ing the election," Tucker said . . 

Lanning agreed. "There were 
groups on campus that would have 
been against it no matter what we 
did," he said. 

Yet, the problem seen by stu-
dents such.,as Field, does not only 
regard RIMAC or its controversial 
referendum, It spans the width of 
student involvement in university 
planning, budgeting and operations. 

On a host of day-to-day issues 
and decisions ' on "superficial 
th ings," students do have some say, 
according to Tesak, "[But) on the 
big things we don 't." 

And it is that perception ' that 
prompts some students to feel re-
sentment over the way in which the 

admini~tration handled, and contin-
ues to handle, important and contro-
versial projects such as RIMAC.

Continued from PIle 16 
pers. (Okay, maybe I went too far. 
La Jolla High could give the Clips 
a hell ofa game.) 

Just being a pro athlete demands 
respect. Pros these days, especially 
the babbling Steelers, act just like 
those 14-year-old wannabes. Pro-
fessional smackers, more than any-
thing, show how much they've for-
gotten about what it took to be a pro 
to start with. And they also show a 
lack of sportsmanship. 

The thing that baffles me most 
about trash-talking, however, is that 

hard and did everything I asked 
them to. We did a lot of things right 
in the second half, we just weren't 
hitting." 

UCSO's hard-luck shooting is 
especially hard to swallow because 
the Tritons are in the midst of the 
toughest portion of their schedule. 
If they hope to turn the tide and get 
a victory in their upcoming show-

there is absolutely no benefit in do-
ing so. It's like marrying your sis-
ter. Sure, it 's fun and all, but in the 
end you'll have kids with three ears. 

Time and time again, trash-talk-
ers are upstaged by over-achieving 
competitors who are peeved by what 
someone said. You see, trash-talk-
ing is setting yourself up for the fall. 

In addition, athletes who trash-
talk usually do much better on the 
field when they don't. Take the 
Chargers' Tony Martin, for ex-
ample. Keep him away from the 
mike - where he proclaims him-
self heir to the Jerry Rice throne-
and Touchdown Tony exhibits sev-
eral q~alities that would make even 
01' number 80 smile. 

The Sonics' Gary Payton is the. 

down with the highly-touted Cal 
Lutheran squad (13-0) on Saturday 
night, the Tritons will have to see a 
change in their fortunes: 

"We just have to hope our shoot-
ing is better," Malone said. "We 
can't go into the toughest part of our 
schedule in a slump. The game with 
Cal Lutheran is going to be a battle 
if we're hitting." 

same way. A streaky shooter at best, 
Payton has made leaps and strides 
this season by downshifting his 
motor-mouth, and by doing most of 
his talking on the court. 

So, you may ask, how can this 
growing disease be contained? For 
starters, more publicity needs to be 
given (0 players like Kirby Puckett, 
Steve YOI.!ng and Joe Dumars. 

And as for the non-pros, refer-
ees should penalize again and again 
- like negative reinforcement ex-
periments on rats - until the little 
likes stop smacking. 

It's a cancer on sportsmanship, 
and it's gotta end now. That's a\ll 
have to say. I just schooled you. 
Ding, ding. Everyone stand for the

Put the Trash 
In the Can 

An alarming trend has been 
sweeping across the sporting 
world of late. And it certainly 
ain't newer than RIMAe. 

Ttitons Spot Leopards a Win 
Oh no! This disturbing 

direction has been lurking in 
the shadows all along, growing 
stronger as each day passes. 

It's been hiding, gaining 
power exponentially, like 
cirrhosis in some young 
freshman's liver. In fact, it 
more closely resembles 
gangrene, festering away at the 
integrity of sportsmanship as 
we know it. 

It's worse than Kenny G 
and has more staying power 
than Dick Clark. "But it can ' t 
be that bad!" you exclaim. " It 
just can' t be!" 

It is. 
And this phenomenon 

hasn't sprung upon us like the 
Italian-renegade Frankie 
character during the "A-
Team 's" illustrious final 
season. II wasn 't sudden and 
shocking, like my seventh-
grade band teacher who left 
class one day balder than 
Kojak, and came back the next 
day with more hair than David 
Crosby. 

No, it started small, and it 
grew rapidly. It 's trash-talking, 
and - simply put - it 's gotta 
stop soon. . 

Has anyone been listening 
to the slop being spoken in 
games these days? It 's 
ridiculous. Non-professional 
athletes, in particular, should 
never talk. That's because, 
more often than not, their 
creative comments are better 
than their actual play. Much 
belter. 

I mean, is there anything 
worse than a 14-year-old 
Jordan-wannabe with baggy 
shorts driving the lane with a 
crappy finger-roll, and saying, 
"Get out of my kitchen!"? 

What happened to funda-
mentals? What happened to 
giving respect? Non-pros are a 
dime-a-dozen. They have as 
much a chance as making it to 
the big-time as Steven King 
has at winning a Pulitzer Prize. 
Arrogance is unacceptable 
when you have nothing to 
show for it. 

But professional athletes 
are just as arrogant. It takes an 
enormous amount of skill and 
dedication to be a pro athlete. 
It 's the same game if you play 
football for the Bucs or the 
Niners. Or if you play basket 
ball for the Sanies or the Clip-

SWMP: Poor shooting Tritons 
spot Leopards 13-point Jead, go 
on to lose second straight, 79-61 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's basketball team (9-4) 
began its season on a hot streak, winning nine of 
its first 11 games. However, the Tritons have 
struggled mightily in their last two contests. 
UCSD's untimely shooting woes already resulted 
in a heartbreaking one-point loss to Chapman 
last Saturday night. 

On Tuesday evening, the Tritons played host 
to La Verne University and the Leopards took 
fu ll advantage of UCSD's hospitality, marching 
away with ~ 79-61 triumph as the Tritons once 
agai n couldn't find the range. 

"The last two games we 've lacked shooting," 
UCSD Head Coach Judy Malone said. "We just 
haven 't been pUlling the ball in the hole." 

The Tritons trailed from the outset and, al-
though they made a val iant effort to cli mb back 
into contention, they simply weren ' t ab le to put 
together a string of points because of a poor .329 
shooting percentage for the game (25 for 76). 
UCSD never got on track from beyond the arc . 
either, shooting a miserable four of 17 from 
downtown. 

The Leopards, however, had the hot hand 
thanks in part to the leadership of Division II 
transfer, Leslee Rogers. Rogers burned UCSD 
for 26 points in the game on four-of·six shoot· 
ing fro m three-point land. Rogers also reeled in 
16 rebounds and did not leave the game, playing 
the entire 40 minutes of the contest. 

"[Rogers] was tough," Malone said. "We 
knew all about her, we just could not stop her." 

La Verne stormed out to a double-digit ad-
vantage in the early going, when Kelly Perkins 
nailed a long trey that put the Leopards ahead, 
23-10. The Tritons clawed back to within nine 
at 25-16, when Michelle Henricks, who led 
UCSD with 12 points in the game, drove to the 
hoop for a layup. 

But 'the Leopards quickly stifled the Triton 
momentum with an inside putback by Carmen

Senior Taml Oviatt cr.-hed the boards for five rebounds durin, Tuesday's loss. 

Diaz and a long distance effort from Rogers that 
swished through, prompting UCSD to call a 
timeout trailing 30-16. 

UCSD still couldn ' t slow Rogers, however, as 
she and point guard Tiffany Hall each nailed 
threes, to extend the Leopards ' cushion going into 
the half, 40-23. 

With the daunting task of erasing a 17 point 
deficit, the Tritons tightened up their zone defense 
in an effort to eliminate La Verne's 
inside game. The ploy worked, but the 
Leopards simply didn 't miss from the 
outside. 

~They had 18 points in three-
pointers," Malone said. "They were 
hot and we weren 't. We just have to 
get out of this slump." 

The Tritons made a couple of runs 
at La Verne. With just under 11 min-
utes to play in the game, Sarah 
Schneider nailed a short jumper and 
was fouled. Schneider missed the free 
throw, but Karli Jungwirth snared the 
rebound and layed it in to bring 
UCSD to within 11, 53-42, forcing a 
Leopard timeout. 

With 4: II to play, UCSD called time following 
a layup by Schneider which reduced the Triton 
deficit to 14. However, the Leopards hit their 
free throws down the stretch to keep UCSD at 
arms length. 

A pair of threes by Ci ndy Yamasaki includ-
ing a run-and-gun bomb off a free-throw miss 
put the score at 71-61, but with only a minute to 

See SPOTS, Page 15 

Jungwirth came through again 
with a turnaround jumper on the other 
side of the timeout that closed the gap 
to nine, but La Verne responded by 
surging back to a 16 point margin.

San Diego Film 
Festival will 

showcase a varieiy of 
films from around 

the globe 

he UCSD International Style Film Festival, now 
called the San Diego Film Festival, begins its 10th 
season with its typical list of eclectic foreign films. 
The new name of the festival is not all that has 
changed. This year, the festival has worked closely 

with San Diego Landmark Theatres and as a result has had the 
opportunity to obtain more films. The festival will feature 30 
feature films, as well as an exclusive evening of short films. 
This cultural and entertainment event at UCSD continues to 
present diverse films from around the world which are all 
premieres in San Diego, some of which are showing for the 
first time in the country. 

The countries presenting films this year which have not 
been included in the festival previously are Iran, Hungry, 
Czechoslovakia, Cuba and Senegal, as well as the two Spanish 
regions of Catalonia and the Basque Country. The varying 
themes which run through this year's films range from grim 
and dramatic to satirical to fast and violent. While some of the 
plots never pick up any great speed, such as that of the 
Australian mm, Hercules Returns, and that of Senegal's 
Hyenas, it is almost always guaranteed that each film will offer 
a stunning, or at least creative, style of filmmaking 

Exile, an Australian film by the directorofTheNun and The 
Bandit (shown at the festival two years ago), tells the tale of a 
man who has been sent to live alone on an island fQr the crime 
of stealing sheep. The simplicity and beauty of the story of his 
survival and personal triumph over civilization make Exile 
both powerful and Qne to memorable.

Higher Learning 
John Singletonsfilm tries to tackle 

racism on college campuses 
By Chl.un Simmons 
Staff Writer 

Racism, sexual 
orientation and 
other "taboo" is-
sues have recently 
been explored on 
the big screen. In 
Higher Learning, 
directo r John 
Singleton 

looks at political conflicts on a college 
campus. 

Set on the fictitious campus of 
Columbus University, Singleton fol-
lows the lives of three in-coming fresh-
men, Malik Williams (Omar Epps), 
Kristen Connor (Kristy Swanson)and 
Remy (Michael Rapaport), as they 
experience the anxieties of university 
life which seethes with racial tension. 

Malikbegins his college lifefight-

ing his resentment toward a univer-
sity that seems to only prize him for 
his athletic abilities. He eventually 
discovers that the issues of race and 
class are far more comp licated than he 
had imagined. Kristen arrived at Co-
lumbus University a naive girl from 
Orange County, CA, only to be date-
raped during a fraternity party. Remy 
seeks acceptance from a group of 
Nazi skinheads. 

In traci ng the lives of the three 
freshmen, Singleton paints a picture 
of college life as it is today, in all its 
glory and all its ugliness. Though 
Singleton sometimes stereotypes the 
very characters whom he wishes to 
liberate (for example, the women's 
resource group leader is depicted as a 
lesbian), he nevertheless shows us the 
underlying racial tensions which exist 
at every university campus. The subtle 

scenes in the film are actually the best 
ones. One particularly realistic mo-
ment comes when Fudge (Ice Cube) 
notices theseparat ion of racial groups. 
Another small, yet particularly effec-
tive scene, comes when Kristen 
clutches her purse and gives Malik a 
suspicious look on their elevator ride 
to the dorm rooms. 

Higher Learnifll{ should be cred-
ited for its cast of talented actors that 
includes Epps, Cube and Tyra Banks 
as Deja, Malik 's girlfriend (and oneof 
the most intelligent, rational charac-
ters in the film). But if it weren ' t fo r 
the cast, Higher Leamillg would be 
completely ruined by the over-dra-
matic and cliched plot. The racism 
that exists on collcge campuses is a 
topic worthy of a film, yet Singleton i 
only marginall y successfully in his 
portrayal of university life. 

Murder in the First 
Kevin Bacons strong performance as a 

tortured prisoner is highlight of film 
By Chl.un SImmons 
Staff Writer 

Alcatraz. The for-
biddingfortresson 
the barren island 
in the San Fran-
cisco Bay has been 
a tourist attraction 
formillionsofvisi-
tors. For those 
who have toured 

the facilities, the harshcond itions have 
often brought chills offeara nd amaze-
ment. But what was it like during the 
1930s, when the prison held not only 
the most notorious of prisoners, but 
also the petty criminals of that time? 
What was it like to spend a day, or 
three years, in the horror of a prison 
cell called the Hole? 

Murder ill the First is t he story of 
Henri Young (Kevin Bacon), a 17-
yea r-o Id boy sent to prison at Alcatraz 
forstealingS5lOfeedhissister. When 
Henri attempts to escape from Alcatraz 
after serving close to eight years for 

this crime, he is caught and sent to 
solitary confinement for three years, a 
punishment which normally lasts a 
maximum of 19 days. After being 
released from three years of darkness, 
silence and a:I-consuming fear, he 
sces the man responsible for his or-
deal and in a dazed rage and kills him 
with a spoon. 

James Stamphill (Christian Slater) 
is Henri Young's young public de-
fender. It 's Stamphill's first case, and 
he establishes a friendship with Henri . 
Their heroic effort in court eventually 
spa:rks the investigation of the federal 
penitentiary system. 

With the prison movieShawshank 
Redemption as its most recent prede-
cessor, Murder ill the First holds its 
own with a brilliant performance by 
its cast. Bacon isspectacularas Young. 
Hissympatheticandchillingportrayal 
of a man pushed beyond the limits of 
hope is the highlight of his film ca-
reer. Qest known for his role in the 
teen movie Fooliose, Bacon has been 

one of the most underrated actors in 
the industry. This role has the poten-
tial to launch his career. 

Gary Oldman unce again shows 
his versatility as an actor with his 
performance as Warden Millon Glenn. 
He makes the rolc of the villain be-
lievable by playing the character as a 
man with no regret for his duties and 
actions. Slater turn in a lackluster 
performance as Henri's public de-
fender. He never achieves creditabil -
ity is unable to attain the level of 
passion the role demands. 

Murder ill the First isasolid movie 
with spectacular scenes shot on loca-
tion at Alcatraz, but it never matches 
the compelling nature of the subject 
mailer itself. In the end, it fails to give 
real closure to a controversial topic, 
especially since it was 20 years after 
the Henri Young case before Alcatraz 
was closed. 

Murder in the First will open to-
morrow at theaters throughout San 
Diego.

SAO TASTE 
'Gilligan's Island' withstands test of time 

By Mike Martinez 
Contributing Writer 

In the '60s, before cable television 
and the 6O-channel magic box, most 
folks could get three or four channels 
of programming on the family Zenith. 
The three big networks (CBS, NBC 
and ABC) had a monopoly on TV 
entertainment forthe masses. Because 
of the turbulent times, these masses 
needed a good laugh or two. In a 
nation of 200 million, that's a lot of 
laughs to serve up. 

Demand onsucha largescale made 
the '60s the decade of the absurd 
premise. There were shows about 
astronauts who had their own genies, 
martians who lived on earth, men 
whose mothers were cars, beautiful 
witches who lived in suburbia with 
advertising executives. 

And then there's the story of seven 
people shipwrecked on an island in 
the Pacific. 

That's the simple idea behind 
"Gilligan's Island." Unless you've 
been in an iron lung on the island of 
Tonga for 30 years, you've caught a 
few episodes. "Gilligan" is inexplica-
bly one of the most popular TV sho~s 
ever. The advent of cable keeps the 
Gilligan cult sated in virtually every 

city in the nation, with a rotation of the 
same 98 episodes. It's really just a 
matter of time before Gilligan - The 
Movie starring Mel Gibson plays at 
Cannes. 

If you buy into the notion that a 
simple Hawaiian charter boat can get 
blown so far off course that no one can 
find it, you can accept "Gilligan's 
Island" at face value-as a documen-
tary about recreational boating. 

The seven stranded people include 
an old money couple who brought 
trunks of currency and clothes (on a 
three hour tour?), a glamorous Holly-
wood starlet with a killer evening 
gown that never wilts, a Polyanna 
farm girl and a professor who specia 1-
izes in "dull metals." 

Speaking of dull metals, there's 
also the Skipper and his first mate 
Gilligan. Their bumbling antics are a 
blatant plagiarism of Laurel and 
Hardy's craft. Of all the far-fetched 
shenanigans here, perhaps the far-
thest stretch is to accept the premise 
that Gilligan can even obtain employ-
ment. 

The cast is adequate, and Jim 
Backus' oft-imitated caricature of 
blustery millionaire Thurston Howell 
III is particularly inspired. 

The episode plots on "Gilligan" 
center around the efforts of these poor 
souls to escape the island. The bril-
liant Professor can fashion dinner-
ware out of coconuts and lipstick out 
of berries. He just can't seem to pull 
off a feat that never eluded Tom Saw-
yer - building a seaworthy raft. And 
even if he had, Gilligan would have 
dropped a rock (or a coconut) through 
it. Occasionally, other sitcom stock 
characters wash up on the island and 
escape at the end, never sending help. 
Can you blame them? 

This is not exactly Robinson 
Crusoe. Incredibly, the creator of 
"Gilligan," Sherwood Schwartz (also 
the auteur of "The Brady Bunch"), 
was inspired by the Daniel Defoe 
classic. 

Lest we worry that this is getting 
too highbrow, it's reassuring (and not 
that surprising) to note that the catchy 
"Gilligan's Island" theme was per-
sonally composed by Schwartz, using 
the Johnny Mercer one-finger com-
posing style. 

As noted earlier, the 98 episodes 
of Gilligan have been playing in syn-
dication for 30 years. To this day, I 
can 't bear to eat a coconut or watch a 
guy get hit with one. 

Moving Pictures 
Film series features shorts by farrwus photographers 

By Care Udell 
Staff Writer 

"Moving Pictures 
- Films by Pho-
tographers," is a 
new event at 
UCSD this year 
which explores the 
inseparable link 
between still and 
moving pictures. 

This series is extremely unique, show-
ing rare films or"alllengths by well-
known photographers from the 1890s 
to the present. Each of the four eve-
nings of this series has a different 
theme and will show approximately 
seven to 10 different films. The series 

FEST: Films from 
Asia dominate series 
ContinUed from paee H1 

This year, as in the past, the festival 
will show a large number of films 
from Asia. The Day the Sun Turned 
Cold has already won the Best Film 
and Best Director Awards at the 1994 
Tokyo International Film Festival. 
Based on a true story, this film reveals 
how a son accuses his mother of mur-
dering his father. Another Asian film, 
The Most Te"ible Time in My Life, 
co-directed by a Japanese director and 
a Taiwanese director, is a suspenseful 
melodrama which will be the first in a 
series of three Private Eye films re-
sembling the style of the detective 
genre of the '30s. . 

Ruth Baily, coordinator of the fes-
tival, feels that the most interesting 
films being done in the world right 
now are from Asia. She emphasizes 
that "most often people think that if a 
film is from Japan, it's the same as 

is presented by the Museum of Photo-
graphic Art (MaPA) and sponsored 
by the San Diego Film Festival. 

This film series allows the special 
opportunity to experience how pho-
tographers such as Man Ray and Bruce 
Weber transform their ideas and work 
into a new, yet related, medium. As 
each artist moves from photographic 
to cinematic imagery, various narra-
tives and documentaries unravel. 
These photographers experiment with 
other more fluid ways to tell their 
stories. Because these films are both 
old and rare, and because they are 
predominantly short films, it is very 
difficult to view or have access to 
them in typical venues such as movie 

being from Korea or Hong Kong, and 
that they are all the same thing ... which 
they are not." This year has been 
arranged so that those who wish to see 
more films from different Asiatic 
countries can attend the screenings on 
Thursday nights and those who prefer 
a greater mixture can attend on Tues-
day nights. 

Another addition to this year's fes-
tival is a film from England called The 
Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb. It 
combines 3-D c1aymation with the 
technique of pixilation, animating hu-
man actors frame by frame. This film 
does not merely retell the traditional 
fairy tale of Tom Thumb; it also cre-
atively explores a fantastic world made 
up of giants and little people. It 's an 
eccentric cult film which will most 
likely show at the Ken Cinema in the 
future. 

The festival will continue the au-
dience voting process which began 
last year. Everyone will have an op- . 
portunity to participate by rating each 

theaters or video stores - another 
reason this series is such an amazing 
opportunity. 

On Feb. l ,fiImswhichdepict vari-
ous street scenes throughout cities 
such as Brooklyn and Harlem will be 
shown. The other two scheduled eve-
nings of the series in February are 
"Photojournalism" (Feb. 8) and "Por-
traits" (Feb. 15), both of which ex-
plore the parallel between photogra-
phy and cinema. 

The screenings will take place 
Wednesdays at 7 p.m. at UCSD's 
Mandeville Auditorium. Passes cost 
$15 for students, while single tickets 
are $5. For more information, call the 
UCSD Box Office at 534-6467. 

night's film and voting for the best 
film at the end of the season. Besides 
the trophies the festival awards, this 
year, the best short film will receive a 
cash prize. In the future, Baily hopes 
that UCSD students will enter their 
own short films in the festival. 

Tonight's film, The Travellers, 
directed by oneofIran's mostcontro-
versial filmmakers, tells the story of 
an unlucky wedding. This film intro-
duces the unique Iranian culture, which 
is so scarcely seen in U. S. films. 
Providing the rare opportunity to see 
such a variety oftilms is exactly what 
the San Diego Film Festival does best. 
The festival supplements the more 
predictable homogenous American 
films released so often today. 

All films will be shown at 8 p.m. at 
UCSD's MandevilleAuditorium, pri-
marily on Tuesdays and Thursdays 
through May 30. Festival passes are 
$35 for students, and single tickets are 
$4. For more information, call 534-
6467.
