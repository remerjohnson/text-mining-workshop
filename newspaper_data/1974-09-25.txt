UC Students 
Push Voter 

Registration 
A voter registration drive aimed 

at gathering over 35,000 
University of California students 
before the October 6 deadline 
was initiated last week by the 
U.c. Student Body Presidents' 
Council. The statewide effort is 
being organized to maximize the 
student vote in the upcoming 

ovember election, according to 
the Council. 

The drive will be headed here 
by Daryl Fanberg . Voter 
registration tables will be located 
on campus at each of the three 
colleges Monday through Friday 
from noon to 2:00 p.m. until 
rrlday, October 4. 

The Presidents called attention 
to the October 6 registration 
dead line. The recent elimination 
of voter residency requirements 
in the state means that persons 
new to the county may register 
Immediately - there is no waiting 
period. Students may register at 
thei r campus address, and must 
re-register if they have moved or 
If they did not vote in the 

ovember 1972 general election . 
The student vote has had 

substantial impact in recent local 
elections, according to linda 
Bond, a Presidents' Council staff 
member. "last June, Stanford 
students registering and voting as 
Republicans gave Congressman 
Paul McCloskey critical votes in 
his primary victory. And in 1972, 
th ree AssÂ·emblymen were elected 
by small margins that came from 
student votes." That same year 
two incumbent Assemblymen 
who represented U.c. students 
but who were " unsympathetic to 
tudent concerns" came within a 

few hundred votes of defeat, she 
ald . 

Bond, Co-Director of the u.c. 
Student lobby, the Presidents 
Council 's legislative arm, noted 
that lobby credibility and in-
fluence is directly related to 
tudent voter turn -out. The 

Student lobby was recently 
ranked 12th out of 675 state 
lobbies in a survey of state 
legislators .

In addition to d l cuss ing the academic progress of the universi ty, the

Regents' meeting last week . Simon had uggested various "anti-
inflationary" tactics for the-universi ty, including the use of television 
systems, year-round enrollment, and the limiting of Ph.D programs to 
four of the nin UC camp~5es . M cElroy said educational TV is " no 
panacea" for teaching. " It only enables greater enrollment in lasses, 
and does nothing to improve education ." 

He also commented that regular enrollment year-round wou ld upset 
UCSD's summer programs, in addit ion to requiring that sequen es be 
revamped and restaffed.

Term Papers: -'Mills' Replace Research 
Ch eating in schoo l s is 

probably as old as the in-
stitution of higher education . 
Every school has its stories of 
crib notes, advance copies of 
the test , professional test 
takers, etc . But within the last 
three years a new form, one 
which is " beginning to seriously 
threaten the whole educational 
system," according to Time, has 
hit campuses - term paper mills. 

Unlike past cheating schemes 
these corporations are big 
business and mass production . 
One, Educational Research Inc. , 
keeps an 800 toll -free number so 
that it can receive nation-wide 
business . 

Un like past term paper 
cheatin g through fra ternity 
" Iibraries", these operations are 
big. Ward Warren, the self-
acclaimed king of the business, 
started Termpapers Unlim ited 3 
years ago. It grossed $1 .2 million 
in 1971 . In 1972 it employed 
2,000 people and had branches 
in 50 U.S. and Canadian cities. 

Warren claimed that these 
writers could "write anything on 
any level in any language" . 
Writers got paid a minimum of 
52 .00 per page for un-

dergraduate work and much 
more for special ized topics. 
Their average weekly salary was 
$150. 

Success is almost, but never 
guaranteed. Many firms remove 
from their files any paper that 

received less than a "B" from 
two professors and keep track of 
papers so that the same in-
stru ctor never receives 
dupl icate copies . 

Universal Termpapers went so 
far as to have branch offices at 

campuses around the U.S.; all 
hooked up by telephone to a 
main office in Boston. After 
they received a request they 
would plug a telephone receiver 
into a special copying machine 
and out would come an im-

Obsolete? 

pressivelv researched paper 
from Boston . 

One big reason for the spread 
of these compan ies is the 
prol iferation of trained, but 
unemployed st udents. In t he 
Sixties a lot of students either 

never graduated or pers isted 
around univerSities after 
graduation . These students 
formed a "potential source of 
chea p , educated labor for 
entrepreneurs who realized that 
the margins of academic li fe 
contain potentially rich 
picki ngs," according to an 
Esqui re article 

W arren agreed in a Time 
article, "The secret of my 
success is that my employees 
really believe in what t hey're 
doing . Also there are alot of 
brilliant , long-haired people out 
of wo rk around here, and I rely 
on them." 

What kind of student buys 
the term papers? Some are 
student who could not get by 
any other way . One " self-
confessed term paper Junkie" 
told EsqUire that he couldn 't

Time article aid that "One

success for his children by 
contracting to have all their 
papers written by the pros."

, 'POLITICS: JAMES G. sOlol 

~dent Voter Apathy 
I just I'et:eived a copy of the UC Student Lobby's Report on student 

\/bting patterns in the June 1974 primary which confirmed most of my 
suspiciolls about the voting habits of students. 

Student turnout in the June Prifr:tary averaged ~ to 10 ~r cent lo~er 
than the statewide totals. The stUdent lobby attributes thIS to the hIgh 
rate of transiency among students. Though partially true, students in 
the last presidential election didn't vote in greater numbers than the 
general electorate and in some places even voted in less numbers, 
despite having a candidate in George McGovern who could be con-
sidered a student candidate if anyone could. . 

An amazing fact on turnout was that (allege Republicans, once 
fanatical in their turnout, stayed away in droves. Republican turno~t 
on campus was at least 10 per cent less than thf! anemic Democrattt: 
figures. 

The one exception to the Republican turnout was in Palo Alto where 
Stanford Republicans turned out 67 per cent of the vote. Stanford, In 
the heart of the 12th Congressional District, represented by the out-
spoken Pete McCloskey, proved to be the margin of difference in t~e 
tough renomination of McCloskey. McCloskey had a 1177 vote marg~n 
over his conservative challenger which was more than the 867 margin 
he held in the district oven,lI. 

In fact, Stanford Republicans were the only college st~dents in the 
entire state who changed the outcome of an electIon. College 
Democrats proved they were more liberal than Democrats as a whole, 
as they did not influence the election in any forceful manner. 
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Edmund G. Brown Jr. won on only 
seven of the 21 campuses sampled, but h is major opponent on college 
campuses, Speaker Bob Moretti, won on eleven ~ampuses ~ncluding s~x 
of eight UC campuses and ran a very poor thIrd stateWIde. Brown s 
major opponent, Mayor Joseph Alioto of San Francisco, won only at 
the University of San Francisco. 

College Republicans usually voted as the entire State vote? There 
was no defihite trend toward either liberalism or conservatIsm. For 
exampleUcSD Republicans voted with the winners in all but one of the 
statewide races. One could safely say college Republicans have been 
able to avoid being cast as mindless students who cast their vote in 
one huge bloc . 

In California students have yet to exert much influence onto the 
political process. In the countless races held up and down the state, 
students were only instrumental in one. O~ of the reasons for thIS. has 
to be the large number of students who refuse to become involved in 
partisan politics. Students at UCSD lead all UC cam~uses (tho~~h ~ot 
the whole state) with voters who decline to state theIr party atfll~atlon 
(independents). Eighteen per cent of all students at UCSD have slmp~y 
written themselves out of the primary stages of the democratic 
processes. ... . 

The Student Lobby report is an informatIve and interesting study as 
to why students have yet to become a force in California politics. It is 
something that everyone interested in California politics should read. 

Political notes .... Dan Styron, Socialist Workers Party candidate for U.S. 
Senate will be at UCSD today at noon on the Revelle Plaza and again 
tonight in the Revelle informal lounge at 7:30 ... H.L. Richardson , GOP 
candidate for U.S. Senate will be at UCSD Friday October 11...Other 
candidates will undoubtably put in an appearance but UCSD still 
appears to be an unprofitable place to campaign according to many 
campaign managers. The reason - simply not enough concerned voters. 
The Democrats will be holding their first by-election national con-
vention in Kansas City this December. Already the differing factic;>ns 
are starting to maneuver for positions in the upcoming conventIon 
which should set the tone for the 1976 convention .

presence): and one student actually made a 
preliminary plea for funds. This kind of 
motIvation is what makes American politics a 
basically selfish process, but it is not what a 
student governmpnt should depend on for its 
membership . I venture to say that there are other 
things . 

which, if backed by a coheSive, positively

For instance, the Coop wants to involve 
students more influentially in the hierarchy of 
the administration, both at UCSD and state-
wide. And there are a number of good works 

Therefore, next Monday's meeting is an 
important one; the tone the Coop projects will 
depend on who comes and what they have in 
mind. In any case, there are at least two at-
titudes that cannot be perpetuated if the Coop is 
to work: that the system exists for the 
manipulation of procedure according to 
someone's warped view of expediency, and that 
the most important thing in the world is our 
money.

What Price Student Gov't? 
Toward the end of last spring term and into the summer, The Undergraduate 

Student Counci l (TUSC), which was responsible for the allocation of the revenue 
raised through student activity fees, was reorgan ized into the Student Cooperative. 

The seven-menber Model Building Committee helped draw up the proposal. 
Under it, a new student government agency will be operating this year . 

The Co-op proposal allows any student who attends three co-op meetings a vote 
in committee decisions. According to the proposal 's authors, this will help elim inate 
traditional student government roles in which power is held by a few students. 

And, according to the proposal, the current ban on student elections will be 
continued u'ntil enough students decide they want elections. 

In the follOWing two articles, Triton Times Managing Editor Edward Simons ob-
jects to the co-op being instituted without a vote by the student body. 

The Co-op argues that elections result in a competitiveness which hinders wise 
decision-making, adding there has never been a move to revive campus-wide 
elections since they were discontinued two years ago. 

Should Vote 
BlI Edward Simons 

Sitting sorhewhere on EDNA's panoramic desk 
are some 16-page documents called "The 
Student Cooperative Proposal 1974-1975." 

Written under the auspices of the Un-
dergraduate Student Council by the Model 
Building Committee, the committee recom-
mended a future line for student government to 
follow. Committee members were Ron Bee, 
Cindy Fisher, Mark Freund, Marco LiMandri , 
Don Murphy, Steve Purcell, and Karen Steen-
tofte. 

At the end of the paper's introduction is the 
disclaimer that the plan is not complete and is 
open to suggestions. The next two . pages deal 
with "The Question of Legitimacy." 

If you, dear reader, are age 18 or over, then 
you are probably aware that the federal 
government of the United States has extended to 
you the right to vote. What most ' of us don't 
realize, though the Model Building Committee 
does, is that the government made a bad mistake 
when it included UCSD students as part of the 
electorate . According to the MBC, we don't 
know anything about the issues, are subject to 
plays on our emotions, and are liable to vote for 
someone solely on the basis of appearance. 

We are a sad lot indeed. 
But there is salvation for us in the form of 

legitimacy of action . As defined iF) the structural 
plan, this means attending two of the last three 
meetings, an alternative to elected represen-
tatives because "it seems Â·evident' that the trend 
is not for elections." (I suppose you all 
remember the demographic survey of ca,rnpus 
attitudes towards voting, taken last year?) At any 
rate, this is to ensure that the Co-op will be 
composed of interest groups and motivated 
persons . We are left to assume that elections do 
not produce these people . 

The document goes on to state that how the 
government is formed isn't necessarily im-
portant, â¢ (slipping from its Puritan concern for 
rigged elections) as long as it does somethina. 
We need to have a hand in administrative 
deciSions. So now the question presents 'itself: If 
it doesn't matter, then why no elections' 

If you are in the minority of UCSD students 
who put some iIIplaced trust in elections, don't 
give up hope. After a while you miat\t have one -
after you've been educated by the Co-op. The 
MBC also adds that it doesn't care how the 
colleges choose their budlet representatives, 
but most of us, beinl the uneducated fools we 
are, will probably use the cUted method of 
voting . 

If the first part of "The Question of 
Legitimacy" is to be believed, then the student 
body cannot be considered rational enouah to 
know what's good for it. This same pool of

"The traditional nature of student government 
has a tendency to repress innovation in an area 
in which innovation can be most easily 
achieved. Student government should be open 
to experimentation as institutionalization seems 
to create stagnation . We therefore submit this 
new proposal to reflect our interests in ex-
perimentation and to use this model of 
uniqueness to discover the real or non-existant 
potentials of the students at UCSD." (Page 3 of 
the Cooperative Proposal, 1974-1975.) 

Competitiveness is institutionalized and 
perpetuated by the mere academic structure of 
this University. A .few students interested in the 
potential productivity of UCSD students created 
the Co-<>perative so all students can have the 
opportunity to break from the competitive 
environment of this school and devote their 
individual or collective energies into a 
cooperative experiment in human relations . 

The Co-op is a political , social, philosophical, 
and cultural organization . The Co-op proposes 
to eliminate traditional student government 
roles, i. e. president, V.p., social chairman, etc.; 
extend the present abolition of school-wide 
elections until students decide they want them; 
create a unified student voice representit ive of 
only those who wish to participate in the Co-op; 
attempt to organize and imp lemont variety of 
ideas and innovative projects that many 
students silently advocate. 

The Co-op is already planning to revive the 
cultural atmosphere at this school through joint 
efforts with KSDT and the Campus Program 
Board . Most of the noon activities that will 
occur within the next few weeks wi II be 
reflections of the activities of the Co-op and 
these groups. 

The University should act as a progressive 
institution within the community. There is 
presently no environment in which an exchange 
of ideas and information can occur on this 
campus . Students must start concern rna 
themselves with the problems ari~ing . from . 
surrounding land development; administrative 
decision makina on campus, academic policy 
making, which currently does not include a 
unified student voice; statewide legislation 
which affects everyone; student necessities in 
the areas of low cost housing, day care centers, 
student commercial cooperative endeavors, 
financial aid, student employment, and tranÂ· 
sportation .

War Resisters: Pardon 
Sets Double-Standard 

TORONTO-While Richard Nixon has received unconditional 
Inesty, President Ford has ,announced that he intends to ex-

UdCt a penalty from war resisters so that we can "earn" our way 
back into American society. 

Am I upset that Nixon has been pardoned, while we must 
perform public service and reaffirm our allegiance to the United 
States? Am I bitter? As an exiled American war resister, I have 
been asked this question many times. Perhaps I am a bit stoic, 
but on a personal level I am not particularly upset or bitter, nor 
am I really surprised . 

I am not the only exile already on record as believing that the 
very reason the questIon of amnesty was raised so early in the 
Ford Administration was precisely to set the stage for an early, 
full pardon for Nixon. This cynical attempt to playoff Ni)(on's 
very real criminality against our conscientiously caused legal 
jeopardy is just one more attempt at coverup-and not a very 
good one . 

Most war resisters to whom I have spoken are bitter and upset 
at this ironic turn of events . This is not an abstract issue with us-
our very futures are at stake. Though we generally reject the 
concept of "earned reentry ," the revival of nationwide discussion 
of amnesty had aroused in us both hope and anxiety. 

Two postponements of Mr. Ford's final word on "earned 
reentry" prior to Monday's proclamation left us " twisting slowly, 
slowly in the wind ." evertheless, he moved swiftly to square 
away his former boss 

Sympathy for Nixon? We have little, though by and large we 
are humane and open-minded. It's hard, however, to feel much 
sympathy for a man who has shown so little for others. "Certainly 
I have sympathy for anyone who has made a mistake," Nixon 
said at a press conference in January, 1973, in which he rejected 
proposals for even a " conditional" amnesty. "We all make 
mistakes, but also it is a rule of life we have to pay for our 
mistakes ... The price is a criminal penalty for disobeying the laws 
of the United States :' 

The other night about eight or ten of us were interviewed by 3 
television crew from Chicago. After about six straight questions 
and straight answers, I alluded to the reports of Nixon's 
depressed mental state being the reason for Ford's mercy. I was 
somewhat surprosed by the prolonged laughter that broke out all 
around me. In our four or five years of forced separation from 
famify and friends in the United States, depression has simply 
become a fact of life. 

"There can never be justice for Ihe millions of young 
Americans whose lives were disrupted by the illegal and immoral 
Vietnam war-and it is unlikely that there will ~ mercy. Those 
who on grounds of conscience in some significant way opposed 
Ihe Vietnam war continue to pay, while the debts of a con-
scienceless and Machiavellian former president .rre quickly 
erased." 
Joe Jones, draft resister from Wilkesboro, N.C., now an English 
literature teacher in Toronto. 

. I personally know of three American exiles who have taken 
. their own livesoOne by hanging, one by drowning and one by fire . 
I have seen many others visibly suffer from the strain . How many 
more war resisters have been psychologically maimed by prison? 
How many veterans with less-than-honorable discharges have 
despaired at ever finding decent jobs and making decent lives for 
themselves? How many American families have suffered 
severely? Two of my exile friends could not return to be with 
their dying parents, while others were arrested at family funerals . 

Perhaps I am bitter after all . But we've been bitter for so long 
that often we are left to laugh at the utter absurdity of it all 

What many Americans fail to realize is that we are in e)(ile not 
only because full amnesty has failed to material ize but because 
the war we opposed has failed to go away. 

Mr. Ford has pardoned Nixon for "any and all crimes he may 
have committed" while in the White House. The worst of these 
were the crimes against the I ndochinese peoples (particularly the 
Christmas carpetÂ·bombing of North Vietnam in 1972), the 
flagrant abuse of his powers as commander-in-chief, his cynical 
deception of both the American people and Congress as 
exemplified by the illegal and the unconstitutional bombing of 
Cambodia and its coverup. 

But Congress itself was unwilling to deem such severe abuse of 
executive power to be an impea hable offense, and the man who 
has granted pardon to Nixon carries on his predecessor's policy 
in Indochina. American "boys" have been replaced by American 
dollars and weapons. Only Asians are dying now. It's the biggest 
coverup of them all. 

Perhaps we should be grateful for Watergate. It has been a 
profound educational experience, and if that's the way the 
American system "works," then it's about time we all found out. 
Today anxiety has grown here among those who most want to 
return 'home. We now know that total alflnesty will never come 
Even those who were encouraged by the apparent' growth in 
support for unconditional amnesty share the common 
denominator of outrage. 

Not long ago Amex magazine re<eived a letter from a draft 
resister who had spent four years tlnderground in the United 
States before coming to Canada. His htter suggested that if eICiles 
returned home and faithfully perfomled alternative service, we 
could convince skeptics that we are really all right after all. Soon 
after Nixon's pardon, the ~ 'M~ "'",~ "'itnyl the 
presses," he said, "there's no way I 'm goin. back with conditions 
now "

huma 1 ~urce, however, is to be tapped by the 
Co-op ..,d ma8ically produce responsible and 
intelliaertt leaders. It's a good thing the Co-op's 
claim to legitimacy is so well argued, or 
someone might question its decision to suspend 
voting , 

Marco liMandri later gave to the Triton Times 
a description of the Co-op cenference which 
occurred on August 10th and 11th . 

Three hundred and fifty "interested" students 
were invited to the event. Of these, 45 replied 
and 21 showed up. (It must be remembered that 
this was at a time when most of us were on 
vacation.) So, these 21 represent 6.6% of the 
"interested." It would appear as though most 
people are not interested, though I'm probably 
wrong. The week of Sept . 8th, another meeting 
was held, netting 35 persons . 

LiMandri's letter belies a certain pessimism. I 
find it vaguely disturbing to enter a finance 
meeting and hear sums of money in the 
thousands casually and suavely bandied about. I 
am ill at ease when someone leans back in his 
chair and smugly tells me how many " K" , or 
thousands, this or that will cost. My suspicions 
are roused when a committee member smoothly 
draws up a proposal for an Ad Hoc Committee 
Task Force to Investigate Relevant Dialogues 
and Alternatives Relating to Coordination of 
Budget Sub-Committees on the Increased Cost 
of Chewing Gum. And I can 't avoid the sneaking 
suspicion that a fair number of student members 
derive a deep satisfaction from printing 
mysterious initials after their names 

But I'm probably wrong here, too.

Co-op .. Continued from pqe 3 
intellectual resources at this campus is what 
induced the Model Building Committee to 
propose this new form of student organization . 
Our recent experience with the Co-op has 
revealed to us how sucessful our optimiSm can 
be. 

The Co-op proposal offers the most open of all 
democratic processes. Elections represent a way 
of controlling one's own life. Elections delegate 
political power from the voting aggregate to the Â· 
mouths of the voter's "elected representitives." 

In the spring of 1972, UCSD students passed 
an initiative in a campus-wide vote which 
abolished the old Associated Students Govern-
ment. Only interc:ollege elections have taken 
place since then. No intelligent case has been 
prest'ntf'd as to why campus wide elections 
should occur if there will be no one claiming to 
represent the students of UCSD. If a student 
desires to serve his or her fellow students 
through a social/political role, there is no reason 
why he or she should have to submit themselves 
to a competitive environment resulting from an 
electoral process. 

The Co-op has within it a Resource/ Budget 
Group which distributes the student activity fee 
and allocates space to all student organizations. 
All budget meetings are open to any student. 
The Co-op would like to encourage mass student 
input in deciding the budgetary decisions. All 
budget allocations made by the Resour-
ce/Budget Croup require the entire en-
dorsement of the Co-op. 

The Co-op does not represent a government 
by traditional standards. A government is 
generally comprised of an individual or closed 
group making decisions which effects the lives 
of others, theoretically in the interest of the 
group as a whole. The Co-op is unified student 
advocacy directed towards the welfare of the 

- campus as a whole. Our decision making process 
is open to all the students who care to represent 
their own beliefs. The Co-op represents a unified 
political organization . 

It was stated that 35 people people attended 
the (o-op meeting on Sept. 8. Considering that 
the meeting occured in the summer, a large 
turnout reflects relevant student interests. At the 
Sept. 8 meeting, 35 people voted on issues, that 
was 32 more votes than participated in student 
government decision making over the last two 
school years. 

The Co-op combines a touch of anarchy, 
participatory democracy, meritocracy, and 
socialism into one amorphous group. It is 
organized loosely, but only a loose organization 
can allow itself to improvise with changing 
moods and adapt to new concerns. The Co-op 
has its prime basis in human trust, collective 
efforts, individual responsibilities, and friend-
ship.

Soccer Club 
Meeting Tonight 

Since it is the most popular 
sport in the world it is not sur-
prising to find that soccer is 
played here at UCSD. Athletes 
with varying degree of skill can be 
accomodated on the various 
UCSD soccer teams . 

There is an Intercollegiate team 
for undergraduates. The IC team 
competes during the fall quarter, 
participating in the N.AIA soccer 
tournament at the end of the 
season. Steward Hayes is the 
captain of the team and he may 
be contacted through the PE 
Dept. for more information. 

In addition to the IC team there 
is the UCSD Soccer Club, whose 
membership is open to all people 
affiliated to UCSD in some way 
(faculty, staff, grad students, 

etc.). The club filed two teams in 
the San Diego Soccer League, 
which is affiliated with ' the 
Southern California Soccer Assn. 
The teams will play almost every 
Sunday throughout the season, 
which runs from November 
through March . More information 
may be obtained from Mike 
Pelling (X-1887) or Naresh Mehlia 
(X-2796). 

There will be an introducto~ 
meeting for all those interested in 
soccer (Intercollegiate or Club) 
tonight (Sept. 25) at 7 p .m . in the 
Student Center. 

The Soccer teams have two 
regular practice sessions each 
week . They meet at 5 : 15 every 
Tuesday and Thursday at the 
Mathews Campus Soccer Field.

Finding a Cure 
by Tom Wrlaht 

Are you anemic, hyper or overweight? 
.... AII three, you say? Well, we have the product 

for you! It will put iron into your system, wear down 
those e)(tra nervous tensions and trim that tum-
my!! ... and it's guaranteed, or your symptoms 
returned to you free of charge! 

What is the name of this wonderful cure-a III The : 
UCSD Intramural Programs. There are a total of 7 
(that's seven) different elixors, and depending on the 
severity and duration of your illness, one of these 7 
should cure you. (If not, there's no hope anyway.) 

One is brand new. and though it has been tested 
only once (at Davis), UCSD's Dr. Foo Loo has come 
up with a few changes in the concoction. "European 
Handball." to make it"am icable to almost anyone. It is 
an e)(citing mixture of soccer. football, basketball 
and baseball . and should fix any schizophrenic 
tendencies you might have. Captain's meeting is 
Friday. October 4 at 4 p .m. 

There are 4 Coed drugs to be prescribed for you . If 
you need to swing an inanimate object and strike a 
fuzzy ball and like the outdoors. coed tennis is highly 
recommended. Captain's meeting is Thursday. 
October 3 at 5 p.m. 

polo. Captain's meeting is Wednesday, October 2 at 
4 p.m. 

If you desire to leap and dive for that sometimes 
elusive ball, coed volleyball should provide plenty of 
action . Captain's meeting is Thursday, October 3 at 4 
p.m. . 

For those of you that have water fixations (and you 
need not be a fish) there is Coed Inner tube water 

And then there is original wonder-drug: coed 
football. offering an abundance of contact and nifty 
leg work. Captain's meeting is Friday, September 27 
at 4 p.m. 

Field Hockey 

The final two medicinal lifts are for all the clambo 
men who have that certain frustration to work out. 
Round ball freaks can find a couple friends and form 
a three man team for three man basketball (Captain's 
meeting Friday, October 4 at 3 PAll .) . Finally. there's 
Dr. Foo Loo's favorite prescription for those wishing 
the ecstasy of victory and the agony of defeat (Thank 
you ABC); men's flag football. Sign up your squad of 
invalids this Friday, September 27th, at 3 p.m. 

All meetings are in the Rec. Gym Conference â¢ 
Room â¢... So get together with some fellow sufferees 
and cure yourselves through meaningfulfellowship. 
No experience is necessary. Offer void after the fall 
quarter. , 

All captain 's nleetings will be held in the Rec. Gym 
Conference Room where everyQTle will learn about 
the new forfeit rule which could be a pain in the old 
pocketbook . If your team forfeits, you pay for the 
officials and play no more games until Dr . Foo Loo 
collects the fee (e.g. flag football refs are S3-hr.) Try 
to get a tooth pulled for that! 

All other UC campuses require a "deposit," so 
appreciate the trust between the good doctor and his 

, patients. and have your team show up. 

New Team Organized 
During the summer, a group of 

about forty adventerous females 
formed the nucleus of UCSO's 
newest addition to its menagerie 
of intercollegiate sports - an all 
female Field Hockey team . 

team with five forwards, three 
halfbacks, two fullbacks and the 
ever present goalie. 

This energetic group begins 
their season with an away game 
at San Diego State, so come out 

and give your support to UCSD's 
newest and most unusual team . 

If you are interested in playing 
Field Hockey, contact Margie in 
the PE office or call Judy Irwin at 

7~598. 
The game is played in much the 

same manner as Ice Hockey, but 
with a few minor modifications. 
Tre players utilize their wooden 
sticks to manuver a small white 
ball over a field roughly the size 
of a football fteld . They are also 
allowed a minimal amount of 
protective equipment. Unlike Ice 
Hockey, no intentional body 
contact is allowed. although at 
times it is unavoidable. 

To Fly a Frisbee 

Each side consists of eleven 
players on the field at one time. 
and tiley are deployed in much 
the same manner as a soccer 

The Frisbee Carnival that is 
coming up this Saturday will 
feature instructions in the use of a 
frisbee by a US Frisbee Cham-
pion . Tom Boda. who just 
recently finished third in a world 
championship will be on hand at 
10:30 a.m . to give lessons in how 
to throw and catch a frisbee, as 
well as give an exhibition in the 
art of the frisbee .. 

At 1 p.m . the contest, spon-

sored by Wham-o, will begin . 
There will be six events and the 
first 100 peopfe to finish . 
regardless of how well they do 
will receive a free frisbee . 

There will also be frisbee games 
that you can play for a nickel. 
Prizes will be given to winners of 
the games and the contests . -

If you have any questions 
inquire at the Recreation Office.

The Numbers Game 
by Kirk Robinson 

Unbeknownst to many on campus (even 'the campus police) there 
exists.an illicit organization (shall we call it a Numbers Game) that 
each week puts out a "pick" sheet with some atrocious choices as to 
who is going to win some of the weekend's upcoming football games 

Upon hearing of this illegal and otherwise d cadent operation, I 
immediately submitted my dollar to the " Numbers Man" (I will call 
him LJ in order to protect the guilty. I did this III order to get a good 
scoop that I could expose to the publi c, not to gamble away my Ilard 
earned money, mif!d you. 

LJ handed me my "pick" sheet and told me I had to decide the 
winners of each of the thirty games listed Within the next twenty 
minutes. Using the advice of Lj's sideki ck in the racket, HB, I 
proceded toÂ·pick Stanford over Illinois, Nebraska over Wisconsin and 
Cinncinati over San Diego . Much to my dismay most of my teams 
lost, resulting in my forfeit of the dollar to LJ who just happened to 
pick four of the games right (he also made up the "pick" sheet.) 

After resigning my poor luck to the philosophy that "any team can 
beat a better team on a given Sunday," I vowed not to participate in 
this morally degrading business ever again . 

However. today. as I was minding my own ~usiness I ran across LJ . 
Spying me, he immediately asked for my dollar and gave me this 
week's "pick" sheet. I searched my soul for a respectable reply. but 
finding none and realizing how little a dollar is worth today, I humbly 
paid my dollar and made my picks. I sure hope Oakland can beat 
Pittsburgh ... in Pittsburgh . 

LJ is a sneaky operator. Besides making out the pick sheet each 
week he is often found relaxing at his desk, pretending to be working, 
while actually playing such assorted and potentially decadent games 
as "Rip." or " Score." But behind that face of his. his mind his con-
stantly working, always trying to come up with a line on the up-
coming games (can you imagine giving Cinncinati 8 points against 
the 49'ers) . Although LJ claims to having not made any rakeoffs while 
running the "Numbers Game" one always has to wonder since he 
invariably end,s up winning the pool. 

And then there is Lj's sidekick , HB. HB is one of those " Avis" type 
people. always trying to move up in the world but never getting 
anywhere . He is the constant runnerup to LJ in the pool as well as the 
loser to lJ in the games of " Rip" and "Score.<- HB is also the well 
known victim of the Great Disappearing Office Caper of Spring 1974. 
He is still trying to move up in the world and who knows. maybe LJ 
will even let him win the pool one of these days .. 

How far into the campus community the tentacles of LJ and his 
" Numbers Game" reach one can only imagine. The populace of this 
university should be alerted since LJ and HB have expanded their 
operations and set up a second pool in order to include more people 
and of course make a larger profit, even though they say that the 
person with the most correct picks wins the whole kitty . This I can't 
believe . 

As one becomes involved in the " Numbers Game" one begins to 
spend his whole life watching and thinking football (can Miami beat 
San Diego by more than 9 points this weekend? with the game being 
play\'d here in San Diego?). The "Numbers Game" will involve a 
persun from Wednesday. when the first WFL game is played until the 
follOWing Monday night when Howard Cosell finally closes his mouth . 
to end his weekly barrage of verbal abuse directed at player and fans 
alike. 

Qh, by the way Harry, you sure made one he "~va lucky guess on 
the Monday night tiebreaker game-too had It dldn t coun t.
