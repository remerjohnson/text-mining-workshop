VOLUME 47, ISSUE 31  MONDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 2014 WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

A recent bill proposed by 
California state Sen. Mark Leno 
(D-San Francisco) could raise the 
state’s minimum wage from the cur-
rent rate of $8 per hour to $11 per 
hour by 2015. 

The bill is designed to continually 
raise minimum wage to $12 per hour 
in 2016 and $13 per hour in 2017 
with annual adjustments made based 
on inflation rates beginning in 2018.

Leno co-authored the bill, 

also known as SB 935, with 
Senate Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg 
(D-Sacramento). It will be discussed 
in Senate policy committees in the 
coming spring.

Leno states that his decision to 
propose the bill was in response to 
President Barack Obama’s State of 
the Union address given last week. 
In his speech, Obama urged mayors, 
governors and state legislators to 
take a proactive stance in raising 
minimum wage.

A previous law signed by Gov. 

Jerry Brown last year will raise 
California’s current minimum wage 
of $8 per hour to $9 per hour on 
July 1, 2014 and will raise it once 
again to $10 in 2016. However, the 
law currently doesn’t demand for 
annual adjustments made in accor-
dance with inflation rates.

Sibaja-Allec currently works at Pines 
dining hall in Muir College. She 
earns $9 per hour and is eager for 

Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom joined several college 
groups to endorse San Diego Councilman David 
Alvarez for mayor on Feb. 6 at Price Center Plaza. 
Representatives from the College Democrats and 
the California Public Interest Research Group spoke 
at the rally hosted by the Student Organized Voter 
Access Committee.

The event focused primarily on student issues 
such as jobs and access to education, as well as 
participation in the political process as San Diego’s 
mayoral race headed into its last few days.

Alex Acuna of CALPIRG opened the rally by 

bringing attention to the importance of getting 
involved.

“As students, it’s important to make our voice 
heard,” Acuna said. “We need to get up and partici-
pate by engaging in issues but also by going through 
the election box.”

President of the College Democrats, Ellen Spicer, 
echoed Acuna’s statement and emphasized the need 
for opportunities for emerging leaders to enter 
the workforce. She and her organization endorsed 

UCSD Student Health Insurance 
Plan representatives are formulating a 
new structure to the program in order 
to manage a $61 million deficit and 
provide sustainability for the future. 

According to Undergraduate SHIP 
Representative Stephanie Bailey, the 
deficit is due to negligence. However, 
it was unanimously decided that stu-
dents are not responsible and will not 
see any changes in their health plans 
to pay for this deficit.

“Firstly, we had a different actu-
arial manager, Aon Hewitt,” Bailey 
said. “In the case of UCSD in par-
ticular, they set the premiums way 
too low. Someone at [the Office of 
the President] was responsible for 
overseeing the plan and they didn’t 
do their job.”

UC Office of the President will 
take responsibility for the debt and is 
currently suing Aon Hewitt. However, 
in the future, any debt incurred will 
be the responsibility of the students 
by individual campuses.

The new SHIP changes include 
enacting an executive oversight 
board, creating reserves and a three-
tier design plan with the UC Medical 
Centers. This means that students 
using SHIP will receive a discounted 
rate at UC Medical Centers. UCSD 
has already had this type of plan with 
the UCSD Medical Centers; however, 
now any UC Medical Center will be 
available discounted to students with 
SHIP, including at campuses that are 
not a part of SHIP. 

“We have a really wonderful rela-
tionship with our medical center, and 
we have been a model at the SHIP 
board,” Bailey said. 

While SHIP rates will not increase 
due to the deficit, students should 
still expect to see increasing rates 
simply due to the current 9 per-
cent to 15 percent inflation rates for 
healthcare.

Bailey refers to designing a plan “a 
balancing act” of whether to increase 
the price of premiums or out-of-
pocket costs. While no decisions have 
been made, Bailey reports that stu-
dents have expressed a preference for 
higher premiums because financial 
aid can cover that cost.

“The overarching goal of SHIP is 
to be sustainable. If we can’t do that, 
there’s really no point in continuing 
it; no one is making a profit off of 
SHIP,” Bailey said. “The past is the 
past, and so far this year, SHIP is 
doing well, and hopefully it continues 
to [do well]. Currently, no one needs 
to save SHIP because it’s saving itself.”

The finalized healthcare plan for 
the 2014–15 school year is due the 
beginning of March.

UCSD’s San Diego Supercomputer 
Center is developing the 2014 series 
of “Data Mining Boot Camps” to 
help business professionals and aca-
demic research scientists gain a clear 
understanding of translating data and 
learning how to design, build, verify 
and evaluate models.

SDSC’s Predictive Analytics 
Center of Excellence developed two-
day sessions to provide training and 
tools to non-computer science pro-
fessionals. With the program, they 
can detect patterns and relationships. 
This program was initially launched 
in October 2012, and it aids organiza-
tions by improving analytical skills to 
transform people into talented data 
scientists while preparing managers 

and analysts to perform deep exami-
nations of large and various data sets.

“Conventional statistical analysis 
and business intelligence software, 
although useful, are not designed to 
capture, curate, manage and process 
large quantities of data generated 
by most enterprises,” PACE director 
Natasha Balac said to UCSD News. 
Data Mining Boot Camps thus pro-
vides a way for professionals to learn 
better tools to make sense of this 
deluge of information.

Our society creates 2.5 quintillion 
bytes of data daily, and researchers 
must make sense of all this informa-
tion — leading to a rise in demand 
for data scientists. The boot camp 
sessions have attracted a wide variety 
of industry participants and business 
sectors such as food services and the 
gaming industry.

“Data mining and predictive mod-
eling, now commonly referred to as 
data science, are capable of automatic 
extraction of meaningful value hid-
den in this data, enabling discovery 
of new insights and providing a com-
petitive edge,” Balac said. Managers 
and analysts will be equipped with 
the necessary tools to process the vast 
volumes of data.

The PACE boot camps expand-
ed from the data mining certifi-
cate course offered through UCSD 
Extension. They cover basic data 
mining, data analysis, pattern recog-
nition concepts and predictive mod-
eling algorithms. These camps allow 
participants to shape the analyses for 
their own data.

Boot camp participants will also 
be able to use SDSC’s Gordon, a 
supercomputer with 300 terabytes of 

flash memory. The camps will allow 
participants to apply data mining 
algorithms to actual data, allowing 
for hands-on training. In addition, 
the classroom allows the instructors 
to work with students in a one-on-
one setting.

“Gathering data is easy. In fact, it’s 
so easy it’s exceeding our capacity to 
validate, analyze, visualize, store and 
curate,” SDSC director Mike Norman 
said on the PACE website. “And many 
of our critical scientific problems can 
be solved by harnessing this data.” 
With the methods of analyzing data 
through PACE boot camps, non-com-
puter science professionals can process 
and understand the massive volumes 
of data generated on a daily basis.

California’s minimum wage to rise in 
the near future.

“The cost of living in San Diego 
is expensive, though employers may 
want to hire less or offer less ben-
efits,” Sibaja-Allec said. “I hope this 
raise will help alleviate the burden of 
rising costs in food and shelter.”

Those opposed to raising 
California’s minimum wage argue 
that doing so would be impede job 
creation and curb economic growth. 
They also point out the fact that 

people earning minimum wage now 
would have to consider going to col-
lege to obtain a degree in order to 
earn a higher salary.

Despite the resistance to his bill, 
Leno remains hopeful of his proposal.

“This is where left meets right 
in the political debate,” Leno told 
The Huffington Post on Feb. 3. 
“Conservative folks [...] acknowledge 
that minimum-wage employers who 
are literally paying poverty wages are 
shifting their responsibility for their 
workers’ basic needs — food, hous-
ing, health care — to taxpayers.”

Currently, California’s minimum 
wage is still below the $10.10 mark 
Obama indicated for workers under 
federal contracts through an execu-
tive order he made last week in his 
State of the Union address. It is also 
lower than another bill proposed 
by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and 
Rep. George Miller (D-California) to 
raise the federal minimum wage to 
$10.10 and adjust it annually accord-
ing to rates of inflation.

Alvarez as the candidate who pro-
vides the best solution to that issue. 

In an interview with the 
Guardian, Newsom said that the big-
gest challenge facing UC colleges is 
increasing costs.

“There’s been substantial budget 
cuts and doubling in tuition since 
2007, and the impact is dispropor-
tionate to the middle class,” Newsom 
said. “We’ve also got the issue of 
access and quality of education — 
it’s more difficult now than ever to 
graduate on time with all the classes 
you need.”

Alvarez believes that creating 
jobs for college students within San 
Diego is an essential step in his 
growth plan.

“It’s important to start creating 
more small business opportuni-
ties because small businesses really 
impact the economy as a whole,” 
Alvarez said. “We also need to 
focus on our cross-border economy, 
which is one of the things we really 
haven’t tapped into in this region, 
and it’s an opportunity waiting to 
be taken.”

Both the councilman and the lieu-
tenant governor expressed support 
for the idea behind the bill to raise 
California’s minimum wage to $13. 
Alvarez stated that he plans to put an 
initiative on the ballot in November 
to increase the minimum wage above 
$10 in San Diego before a similar 
state initiative takes effect in 2016.

Alvarez is also endorsed by 
California’s U.S. Senators Dianne 
Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, as well 
as Speaker of the Assembly Toni 
Atkins (D-78th). On Feb. 8, President 
Obama also endorsed Alvarez.

Alvarez is criticized by his opposi-
tion for accepting over $4 million in 
campaign money, primarily from large 
labor groups. Out-of-town money 
continues to be an issue in San Diego 
elections as several local politicians 
are being investigated for accepting 
money from a foreign national.

Alvarez’s Republican oppo-
nent and fellow Councilman, Kevin 
Faulconer, has led in recent polls from 
10 News/U-T San Diego by a margin 
of between five and eight points. 

Faulconer is running as a vocal 
supporter of San Diego businesses.

“I’m going to bring my eight 

years of experience of turning this 
city around to making sure we’re 
continuing financial reform at City 
Hall so we have the dollars to invest 
in our neighborhoods,” Faulconer 
said to CBS 8.

Faulconer boasts a list of local 
endorsements, including those by 
the San Diego Regional Chamber 
of Commerce and the San Diego 
County Hotel-Motel Association. 
Former City Attorney Mike Aguirre, 
who ran for mayor in the special 
election last year, recently crossed 
party lines to endorse Faulconer 
as well. Faulconer’s business lean 
means he is often cast as a candidate 
representing the special interests of 
downtown. 

The election is scheduled to take 
place on Tuesday, Feb. 11, and cam-
pus polling booths will be open at 
Earl Warren College, Muir College 
and Eleanor Roosevelt College. 
Students who live in Sixth College, 
Thurgood Marshall College, Revelle 
College or the Village will vote at 
Price Center.

The UCSD Guardian editorial pages once endorsed Bob Filner 
as “the lesser of two evils” 
in his run for mayor against 
Tea Party-leaning Carl 
DeMaio. Fast-forward 16 
months after the November 
2012 election, and not only 
is Filner no longer mayor, 
he’s the perfect example 
of how so much can go so 
wrong in so little time.

In 16 months, our city 
has gone through a scandal 
at City Hall, a mayor who 
lasted all of 9 months and an 
interim mayor who’s been 
trying to hold it altogether 
for the past seven. Not to 
mention the recent revela-
tions that a handful of our 
local politicians (including 
Mr. DeMaio) have been tak-
ing illegal campaign money 
from a foreign national. 
Frankly, it’s kind of embar-
rassing that our A.S. Council 
has worked more cohesively 
and done more for its con-
stituents this year than our 
city government has.

We think it’s about time 
we see some real leadership 
downtown. That’s why we’re 

endorsing Councilman 
David Alvarez for his prov-
en record of legislation, his 
progressive ideas and his 
potential to bring stabil-
ity to a city that has had 
way more than its share of 
mayor trouble.

San Diego native Alvarez 
is finely tuned to the unique 
problems of a city that 
is home to some of the 
wealthiest neighborhoods in 
America alongside some of 
the most typically working-
class. He has made equal 
opportunity a central point 
of his campaign and of his 
time in the San Diego City 
Council, repeatedly stat-
ing that everyone deserves 
a chance to create a good 
life for himself or herself, 
regardless of where they 
might come from. Alvarez 
uses an example of the dis-
parity in how long it takes 
emergency services to reach 
someone in one part of San 
Diego versus another to 
demonstrate the need for 
equity of services and the 
importance of supporting

Russia implemented a law last July banning homosexual pro-paganda, a law that exposes 
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
people to harassment and validates 
violence against them. The legislation 
has broad ramifications and estab-
lishes an official culture of homopho-
bia in Russia. The Sochi Olympic 
Games have brought this policy to 
international attention, and people 
worldwide are rightfully shocked 
by the hatred that is shown toward 
LGBT people and activists in Russia. 
Americans should show solidarity 
toward Russian LGBT people and 
boycott the Olympic games.

The law bans people from repre-
senting straight and gay relationships 
as socially equal, which criminalizes 
neutral information about gay rela-
tionships in public media, includ-
ing the Internet and newspapers. A 
Russian journalist was charged by a 
Russian court for publishing an inter-
view with a schoolteacher who was 
forced to resign for being gay and was 
quoted as saying, “My very existence 
proves that homosexuality is normal.” 
A law preventing speech about homo-
sexuality is endorsing hatred toward 
them. If one criminalizes declaring 
homosexuality normal, one must 
believe that homosexuals are unnatu-
ral, and a public policy justifying this 
view only fuels societal hatred toward 
LGBT people. 

According to Human Rights 
Watch, Russian government officials, 
journalists and celebrities have pub-
licly called LGBT people perverts, 
abnormal and repeatedly correlate 
homosexuality with pedophilia. 
This is an inaccurate and dangerous 
message to be spread by influential 
public voices and therefore, should 
garner international public dissent. 
The Olympic Charter specifies that 
the role of the International Olympic 
Committee is to encourage the pro-
motion of ethics in sport and oppose 
any political or commercial abuse of 
athletes. Russia is hosting the 2014 
Winter Olympics and should be 
exemplifying these values but instead 
represents just the opposite. With 
international attention focused on 
Russia, the next few weeks are a ripe 
opportunity to communicate to the 
Russian government that discrimina-
tory policies will not be tolerated.

Authorities reportedly turn a con-
spicuously blind eye to abuse against 
LGBT activists. In an interview with 
the UCSD Guardian, Igor Kochetkov, 
the head of the Russian LGBT 
Network, says most homophobic 
violence is not reported. A study by 
the network found that of the 20 cases 
that had been reported recently, four 
were investigated and one resulted 
in a court case. Russian law does not 
outlaw discrimination against gays, so 
this outcome is expected. Additionally, 
if Russia doesn’t allow positive infor-
mation about LGBT people to be cir-
culated, there is no way for its LGBT 
youth to know that the way they feel 
isn’t a disease or a moral flaw. 

Homosexuals are not forbidden 
from attending or competing in the 
Olympics, but they are forbidden 
from exhibiting pride for their identity 
or acting in protest toward a national 
policy that deplores their existence. 
This law can lead to more repression 
and persecution of homosexuals in 
the future, and Russia should not have 
the support of the civilized world.

Dear Editor,
You have likely heard of CALPIRG 

along Library Walk or in one of your 
classes. Many of you have undoubt-
edly been asked to pledge money 
towards CALPIRG. So what is 
CALPIRG?

The California Public Interest 
Research Group is a student directed 
and funded non-profit organization, 
with over 16,000 student members 
in California. Whether it is estab-
lishing the nation’s first recycling 
programs, creating a state library for 
open-sourced textbooks or pushing 
Congress to increase Pell Grants by 
$36 million, CALPIRG has been the 
voice for college students standing 
up to powerful special interests for 
over 40 years.

Easy commonsense solutions exist 
for many of our problems today, but 
they are far too often undermined by 
the influence of oil companies, banks, 
agribusinesses, etc. Without an effec-
tive voice standing up to counter this 
power, what kind of future can we 
expect to live in?

Political, social and economic 
change has often begun with pas-
sionate youth who want to make the 
world a better place. However, it is 
hard for college students to simply 
begin changing the world with-
out some direction. That is where 
CALPIRG comes in. With CALPIRG, 
students are able to hire professionals 
to research solutions to the world’s 
issues, organizers on campus who 
impart their skills directly on students 
by teaching them how to be powerful 
agents for change and advocates who 
work full time in Washington D.C. 
and Sacramento to make sure student 
voices are heard in the public arena. 
Altogether this builds student power 
to not only fight for our interests, but 
the public’s interest as a whole.

So how does CALPIRG do all 
that? After all, professional full-time 
staff cannot work for free. In order 
to keep maintain the organization, 
thousands of students pledge $10 
per quarter on their tuition bill to 
fund CALPIRG. Not only does this 
keep the organization accountable 
to students, but pledging gives stu-
dents the power and resources to 
make a difference on issues that are 
critical to our everyday lives; cleaner 
beaches, less air pollution, cheaper 
textbooks and reducing the power of 
mega-donors who threaten to drown 
out our voices in elections.

Over the next two weeks 
CALPIRG will be running its pledge 
drive, with a goal of getting 1,200 new 
members here at UCSD. Because of 
our contracts with the university, we 
are at risk of losing all of our funding 
if we do not reach this number. That 
is why it is so important we get sup-
port from you.

As young people we are inherit-
ing a lot of problems: the high cost of 
education, steep levels of unemploy-
ment and a degraded planet. But the 
future is ours. If we care to do so, we 
can make sure that the world we leave 
is better off than the one we were 
given. History shows that when the 
student voice unites, we can make a 
difference. Make sure your voice is 
heard. Pledge CALPIRG.

As a former educator, Alvarez 

understands the problems of access 
to education seen throughout 
San Diego County schools and in 
UCSD itself. In his term as a city 
councilmember, Alvarez revived 
technology and arts programs, 
demonstrating a commitment to 
quality education for children of all 
ages. These ambitions culminated 
in his desire to see more local and 
historically underrepresented stu-
dents attend UCSD — ideas that 
are essential to a school always 
looking to improve its campus 
climate. Like us, he believes that 
the cost of education is too high 
and was a vocal supporter of 
Proposition 30.

Alvarez also believes that stu-
dents need better opportunities 
as they enter the workforce, par-
ticularly in STEM fields like solar 
energy that many of UCSD’s engi-
neering students typically gravitate 
to. As the border councilmember, 
he also sees opportunities in the 
largely unexplored cross-border 
economy, particularly in regards to 
small businesses.

It’s not all money matters 
though. Alvarez boasts by far the 
best environmental policies of any 
candidate to have run for mayor, 
with sustainable, long-term water 
security at the forefront of his 
blueprint for San Diego’s develop-
ment. Whereas Filner had the right 
rhetoric when it came to the envi-
ronment, Alvarez has the drive to 
make these essential ideas a reality 

during his term as mayor.
In our interviews with Alvarez, 

we found him to be congenial 
and frank and free of the plastic-y 
veneer that coats many politicians. 
We think it speaks to his character 
that he took the time to answer our 
many questions and brought out 
the political geek in all of us. 
President Obama, Senators Diane 
Feinstein and Barbara Boxer as well 
as many local labor and environ-
mental groups endorse Alvarez, 
although clearly this endorsement 
from a campus newspaper with a 
readership of literally dozens is the 
one he’s been waiting for.

We want to encourage all UCSD 
students to vote this Tuesday and to 
particularly keep David Alvarez in 
mind as the mayor who will work 
for all of us.

Alvarez’s Policies Can Improve Education and Environment

-.#/0**(10'2 SINCE 2012, INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS’ APPLICATIONS TO THE UC SYSTEM HAVE DOUBLED, RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT ADMISSIONS AND TUITION FOR CALIFORNIANS AS WELL AS OUT-OF-STATE STUDENTS.

Although the UC system has recently been 
facing budget shortfalls, native Californians 
should not suffer because of its current finan-
cial situation. California residents pay taxes 
that provide the majority of the funding for the 
University of California; therefore, they should 
receive priority when it comes to both admis-
sions and tuition.

According to California Forward, the UC 
system is at an all-time high with non-resident 
admissions and consequently at a dismal low in 
admissions of Californians. The problem is that 
in order to keep tuition costs low and financial 
aid high for in-state students, administrators 
have been accepting more out-of-state and 
international students, who pay nearly double 
the fees and contribute a hefty sum to the UC 
system’s coffers. While this helps monetarily, it 
is unfair to the hard-working Californians who 
count on attending the public schools that they 
already help pay for.

In 2012, former Sen. Michael J. Rubio 
(D-CA) proposed a plan to cap the number of 
non-resident admissions at 10 percent of the 
incoming freshman class for a given year. In 
his words, this would ensure that California 
residents would not be impaired because of 
wealthier students from out of state. While this 
plan did not become law, the concept should be 
something to be considered for the future. 

The model in years to come for the UC 
system should also focus on viable options to 
bolster funding, including raising education 
taxes for wealthier Californians or procuring 
more private capital. A May 2012 New York 
Times article said that the system was “operat-
ing at 1997 levels of funding from the state, 
while serving 70,000 more students.”  Clearly, 
lawmakers and administrators in the UC system 
need to work to fix the financial deficit and 
make California students the priority again.

Out-of-State American Students 
Deserve Discounted Tuition Rates

Students from Overseas Bring More 
Than Just a Source of  UC Funding

UC System Should Put California 
Taxpayers First in Admission Process

While most people generally associate inter-
national students with decked-out iPads or new 
Mercedes cars, they are not simply a funding 
source for the University of California. If diversity, 
fairness and inclusion really are essential ingredi-
ents of academic excellence (see UCSD’s mission 
statement), it’s about time to stop alienating the 
students from abroad who bring rich, cultural 
diversity to our campus. International students pay 
a hefty tuition to attend our public school systems 
and should not be treated like open wallets to foot 
the bill for budget shortfalls.

The point of a university is to expose students to 
new ideas, opinions and perspectives. International 
students are essentially the ultimate fulfillment of 
this goal; they bring diversity to universities by 
exposing American students to different cultures. 
According to a 2013 Duke University study, uni-
versity graduates who interacted with international 
students in classes and dorms were more likely to 
learn a different language and reconsider political 
issues from different historical perspectives.

It’s a common misconception that because inter-
national students pay upwards of $36,000 a year in 
tuition alone, along with additional costs for hous-
ing, universities cut foreign applicants a “break” 
with lower admission standards. Alongside standard 
requirements such as the SAT or ACT, international 
students must also take the Test of English as a 
Foreign Language or the English Language Testing 
System to prove their proficiency in English. These 
students are also expected to have the full menu of 
extracurricular activities on their resumes as well as 
the clear ability to pay, since they qualify for little to 
no federal financial aid.

While it’s important to keep prices low for 
Californians and American citizens, international 
students, too, shouldn’t see more tuition increases. 
The UC system should continue prioritizing 
affordable education and diverse experiences for 
all of its students.

Out-of-state students are always lumped togeth-
er with international students when it comes to 
college statistics, but this is unfair when they have 
entirely different circumstances. Both out-of-state 
and international students are classified as non-
California residents and thus pay the same non-res-
ident tuition. However, considering that 12 percent 
of UC funding comes from a mix of non-resident 
tuition and money from the federal reserve, out-of-
state students are essentially paying more for tuition 
since out-of-state students pay federal taxes too. 

It seems nonsensical for out-of-state students 
not to benefit from being American students, espe-
cially when considering that out-of-state students 
are more consistent, economic investments for 
America. Many out-of-state students decide to go 
out of state because a non-local university has a 
better program for their field. Nonetheless, an out-
of-state student will still stay in America with their 
newly acquired expertise and contribute to building 
a strong, national economy. 

In comparison, many international students 
only stay in America for the duration of their 
studies. In a 2006 study done by the University of 
Minnesota, researchers found that a decreasing per-
centage of international students come to America 
with the intent of staying after their studies are 
completed. Accordingly, these students enter with 
only student visas, which expire 60 days after grad-
uation. They leave America with their new degree 
only to return home and enter the workforce there. 

Admission percentages of non-resident students 
also reflect on the negatives of being an out-of-state 
student. Only 7 percent of UCSD freshmen are out-
of-state students while 16 percent are international. 
Out-of-state students benefit America more, yet 
they are seemingly placed at the same priority level 
as international students. If the U.S. wants to help 
revitalize the national economy, prioritizing out-
of-state students by giving cheaper tuition to them 
than to international students would be a start.

G iven the alarming series of recent school shootings across the nation, the issue of campus safety has become wide-spread. Last month alone — over the course of 19 days — no fewer than 11 active shooting incidents — or active engage-ments in killing or attempting to kill people in enclosed and 
populated spaces — took place on or near American high school and 
college campuses between Jan. 9 and Jan. 28. These incidents resulted in 
two fatalities and injured at least 11 students, as reported by The Wire 
on Jan. 28. Despite the increased safety measures — more metal detec-
tors, surveillance cameras and fences — that many U.S. schools adopted 
in response to the massacre at Connecticut’s Sandy Hook Elementary 
School in December 2012, our nation has not seen a decline in gun vio-
lence on school grounds, according to the Associated Press.

With this troubling rate of school shootings and an estimate of about 
500 violent deaths associated with U.S. schools in the last 20 years, 
according to Ronald Stephens, executive director of the National School 
Safety Center, promoting security on campuses nationwide — UCSD 
included — remains crucial. 

UCSD students have received an influx of timely warnings from the 
UCSD Police Department since the end of last quarter. The most recent 
notice — issued Feb. 3 — detailed a report of an armed robbery in a 
parking lot adjacent to the Spanos Athletic Field that occurred on Feb. 2. 
Prior notices from this school year disclosed reports of an assault with a 
deadly weapon by Center Hall on Dec. 2, a suspicious death near Birch 
Aquarium on Jan. 13 and a sexual assault in the Warren residential area 
on Jan. 23.

In the face of a variety of dangerous crimes, the UCSD Police 
Department insists that crime rates have not changed for the worse and 
that UCSD remains a safe campus.

“Despite this cluster of notifications, we want to assure you that UC 
San Diego remains a safe place to learn, work and live,” the UCSD Police 
Department said in a statement to the Guardian. “Crime statistics show 
that non-drug and alcohol-related offenses have held relatively steady 
over the last three years with no significant change.”

Though UCSD’s 2013 Annual Security Report reveals fairly con-
sistent crime trends — with the exception of significant increases in 
reported accounts of drug and liquor law discipline from 2010 to 2012 — 
the UCSD Police Department emphasized a need to encourage a collab-
orative effort among all community members to boost campus security.

“We encourage everyone to take responsibility for their own safety 
and, when possible, assist others,” the statement said. “Always use com-
mon sense, be proactive and take precautions.”

SDSU Public Information Officer Joshua Mays, who said that the 
SDSU campus, similarly, has not experienced any significant change 
in crime trends over the past five years, also believes that safety is the 
responsibility of everyone, not just the police officers.

“We lean on the community to report suspicious activity and crime 
to the police department,” Mays said. “Our campus is in a very urban, 
busy part of the city of San Diego and ‘securing’ the campus is virtually 
impossible.”

For 2011, the San Diego Police Department reported a rate of 1.33 
violent crimes per 1,000 residents in La Jolla, which was significantly 
smaller than the national average of 22.5 violent crimes per 1,000 
residents that same year, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. 
Though UCSD resides in the affluent and generally peaceful community 
of La Jolla, some students, considering the recent outbreaks of crime, still 
worry about their safety on campus.

The UCSD Police Department and the Sexual Assault and Violence 
Prevention Resource Center, or SARC, have coordinated Annual 
Lighting Survey Walks to evaluate dark areas and points of concern. 
Representatives from various university departments have participated, 
walking throughout the campus to identify issues, for the past 20 years. 
Though identified lighting and safety issues are routinely reported to 
Facilities Management, a stabbing last quarter, which took place in an 
unlit section of Library Walk, indicates that poor lighting is still a perva-

sive issue that contributes to feelings of fear and insecurity on campus.
“I rarely feel safe at night because of the lighting issues,” UCSD stu-

dent Hannah Ingersoll commented on the UCSD Guardian Facebook 
page in response to a Dec. 2 post about campus safety. “I mean, the 
forests are pitch black.”

While reported cases of burglary and motor vehicle theft on campus 
have gradually decreased from 2010 to 2012, according to the Annual 
Security Report, there has been a rise in reports of aggravated assault 
from two in 2010 to 11 in 2012 and a relatively constant trend of reported 
sex offenses at UCSD. 

But data shows that whether or not college campuses are effec-
tively addressing and responding accordingly to reports of sexual 
violence is questionable. The U.S. Department of Education’s Office 
of Postsecondary Education has reported a clear rise in forcible sexual 
assaults since 2010. However, statistics from the U.S. Department of 
Education’s Office for Civil Rights reveal a growing reputation among 
colleges and universities for allegedly mishandling cases of sexual 
violence. Complaints filed against institutions of higher education for 
violating federal anti-sex discrimination law Title IX of the Education 
Amendments of 1972 in addressing these cases have risen from 17 in 
2012 to 30 in 2013, according to The Huffington Post. The Huffington 
Post reported that almost two dozen schools are under investigation, at 
least 11 in response to complaints filed by students, faculty and alumni.

To target the root of ongoing cases like these, UCSD advocates pre-
ventive measures through multiple departments that aim to educate our 
campus about safety and crime, such as SARC, the Office of Student 
Conduct and the Women’s Center. 

“SARC is dedicated to [creating] a safe and respectful community 
that does not tolerate sexual assault, relationship violence and stalking,” 
UCSD Communication and Public Affairs Assistant Manager Christine 
Clark said in a statement to the Guardian. 

In 2011, SARC launched a campaign called “Every Little BIT 
Counts…It Starts With You” in order to publicize bystander interven-
tion strategies. 

“Bystander intervention is when one person chooses to speak up, step 
in or engage others to help when witnessing uncomfortable situations,” 
Clark stated. 

The ongoing campaign offers workshops to teach students about the 
UCSD Bystander Intervention Model, which promotes active participa-
tion in mitigating dangerous situations. Though the focus of the cam-
paign is violence prevention, SARC Director Nancy Wahlig believes the 
BIT model can be applied to situations concerning racism, homophobia, 
hazing, alcohol abuse or students at risk.

SARC is addressing security issues online with a new program titled 
“Who’s Checking You In/Out?” The campaign leaders hope to reduce 
students’ risk of cyberstalking and increase awareness of online safety 
through in-person educational workshops and their online “Ollie Hoo” 
avatar — an owl that serves as the face of the campaign while regularly 
tweeting advice about online safety. SARC has integrated this program 
into freshman orientations beginning this school year.

Campaigns and programs like these may represent proactive steps 
towards preventing crime. But even though there is no clear path to stop-
ping crime, the UCSD Police Department has not reported any proposals 
for implementing new safety measures in response to the recent national 
events and incidents on campus.

“I think that’s one of the major problems,” Stephens said in an inter-
view with the Associated Press. “There are [no] easy answers. A line I 
often use is ‘Do everything you can, knowing you can’t do everything.’”

In a grand gesture to kick start 2014, 
UCSD engineers from the Jacobs School of 
Engineering and toy manufacturing compa-
ny WowWee wowed the technology industry 
at the International Consumer Electronic 
show in January with a unique, self-balanc-
ing toy robot.

The device’s full name is Mobile Inverted 
Pendulum — though it’s endearingly 
known to the public as “MiP.” Scheduled 
to hit the toy market in May 2014, MiP is 
a seven-inch-tall, battery-powered, multi-
functional unit that looks like a miniature 
hybrid between R2-D2 from Star Wars and 
EVE from Pixar’s “WALL-E.” Not only is 
it able to keep itself standing upright, but 
it can do so while holding and balancing 
other objects, like a second MiP robot.

MiP’s development marks the first time 
an inverted pendulum technology has been 
successfully translated into an affordable 
and widely commercialized product. It also 
marks the first time UCSD has licensed its 
technology as a toy.

MiP’s developers believe that the inverted 
pendulum technology, coupled with the toy’s 
interactive response to simulate humanlike 
motor skills, is what sets MiP apart from other 
statically stable robots.

“The one word I like to use is ‘organic’ — if 
you take a push, it will step back to respond,” 
UCSD professor and Coordinated Robotics 
Lab Director Thomas Bewley said.

MiP is also designed to be “hacked” by 
users to create additional custom features. 
Capable hackers can access MiP’s processor 
through the three-pin connector located on 
its back. Bewley’s own MiP unit carries a 
fire-ready bazooka that shoots out bubbles 
on its shoulder. And for those who lack 
the hacking expertise to create a bubble 
bazooka, Yanofsky foresees the production 
of hacker kits made for the average con-
sumer to join in on the excitement.

The idea for MiP was originally pre-
sented to WowWee in 2006, when Assistant 
Director of the UCSD Technology Transfer 
Office David Gibbons became interested in 

the robots at the Coordinated Robotics Lab 
in the UCSD Jacobs School of Engineering. 
Gibbons brought WowWee founder and 
President Peter Yanofsky to evaluate the 
designs for commercial use. Back then, the 
initial technology behind MiP was pre-
sented as a raw series of inverted pendulum 
robot designs. Three years later, UCSD 
began its partnership with WowWee.

“In this case, we allowed our relation-
ship to follow its course and everyone to 
get comfortable with each other,” Gibbons 
said. “And when we did the licensing agree-
ment, it was just a piece of cake.”

But MiP’s entire creation and design pro-
cess wasn’t all smooth sailing. UCSD Ph.D. 
candidate Saam Ostovari, head student in 
charge of the MiP project, explained that 
the biggest difficulty came in translating an 
expensive, academic, inverted-pendulum 
design to a cost-efficient yet fully functioning 
robot to be massively produced in factories.   

“To put the process into perspective, it 
took me about a month or two just to get 
the initial prototype working and an addi-
tional four to five months to get the right 
motors built in the factories,” Ostavari said.

Though MiP representatives hesitated 
to project a direct estimate of the revenues 
their product may generate, they are confi-
dent about MiP’s reception after its official 
release in the next few months.

“We assume that we will get into every 
major retailer in the world,” Yanofsky said. 
“Our marketing is going to be targeted 
towards the older kid in all of us. It will 
get exposure everywhere as a toy and an 
electronic.”

Yanofsky hopes that MiP will not only 
be an innovative toy, but also an indicator 
of potential technology. He and the rest 
of MiP’s creative team asserted that MiP 
is only the beginning of a long series of 
products to come.

“We’ve already looked into exploring 
other robotic concepts,” Yanofsky said. 
“2015 and 2016 are going to have some 
amazing things coming out at UCSD — 
and in WowWee.”

UCSD Research Lab Develops Low-cost Environmental and Medical Sensors

“Most people sell products,” Chief 
Engineer of UCSD’s Distributed 
Health Labs Sean Patno said. “We 
want to sell a concept to people.”

This concept is “citizen science,” 
which is the mantra of Distributed 
Health Labs. The research lab has 
big aspirations, namely establishing 
a network of 1 million people using 
their low-cost devices and apps by 
2015. UCSD School of Medicine 
faculty member Eliah Aronoff-
Spencer and UCSD research sci-
entist Albert Yu-Min Lin founded 
the lab in 2012. The group is based 
at the UCSD Qualcomm Institute 
and is developing its first project, 
dubbed the Oasis Project.

The Oasis Project is the lab’s 
initiative to develop sensors to mea-
sure environmental and health data. 
These sensors are palm-sized ellip-
soids that connect via Bluetooth 
to a phone to collect data. The lab 
has already developed an app called 
My.Oasis in the Apple Store that 
compiles data its users collect.

“For instance, in [Google Maps], 
you get map data [about traffic] 
when you send your speed info to 
Google,” Patno said. “They compile 
the data you send to get good traffic 
data. The more people report, the 
better the traffic data is. We want to 
do the same thing with health.”

Distributed Health Labs is apply-
ing this idea in Mongolia with envi-
ronmental sensors that measure the 
content of poisonous heavy metals 
in water, particularly lead. Oasis 
Project Manager Beke Chuluun, 
who emigrated from Mongolia at 
the age of 17, pushed the lab to apply 
its sensors in his home country, 
where mining has caused significant 
water pollution. The lab hopes to 
equip nomads with sensors to com-
pile data on water contamination to 

create a map of clean water sources 
that will help nomads keep their 
families safe.

The lab is also designing vital 
monitor sensors to measure temper-
ature, heart rate, breathing, pulse, 
blood oxygen levels and electrocar-
diogram information. Experiments 
using a prototype sensor are already 
being conducted in Mozambique in 
collaboration with the UCSD School 
of Medicine and the Universidade 
Eduardo Mondlane in Maputo, 
Mozambique.

Volunteers like Patno mainly run 
Distributed Health Labs with mini-
mal funding from Calit2 Strategic 
Research Opportunities grants. 
The group launched a crowd-
funding campaign on Indiegogo in 
December that is still struggling to 
gain steam. 

As of now, the Distributed Health 
Labs has raised $9,605, which is sig-
nificantly short of its $50,000 goal. 
The campaign ends Feb. 20. The 
group will be able to keep what-
ever funds it has raised by that time, 
minus a 9 percent fee for not reach-
ing its goal.

“If it’s hard enough to get peo-
ple excited about the project [on 
Indiegogo], it’s going to be tough to 
get people excited to actually use it,” 
Patno said.

Though received well in academic 
circles, the Oasis Project hasn’t gained 
much traction with the public, as 
the group’s actual sensors are still in 
development and the project’s main 
goal of citizen sensing isn’t as tan-
gible as other products advertised 
on Indiegogo, such as Wong Fu 
Productions’ first feature film.

Distributed Health Labs aims to 
earn more funding to fuel the devel-
opment of their sensors. They hope 
to win the Qualcomm Tricorder 
XPRIZE, a competition to develop 
effective, low-cost health diagnostic 
tools. The prize is $10 million.

The group is also looking for stu-

dent volunteers to join their team. 
Interested students should visit the lab’s 
website at www.dhlabs.calit2.net.

Even though Patno doesn’t 
receive a wage for his contributions 
to the Oasis Project, it’s the end goal 
that keeps him and the rest of the 

group motivated in the face of their 
many obstacles.

“If these [technologies] actu-
ally work, we can actually do sens-
ing and get health information that 
you wouldn’t normally get access to,” 
Patno said. “The open source nature 

of our work is really exciting, because 
we can see how other people use our 
technology. It’s always a fun thing to 
be a part of.”

ultimately never regained the lead. 
“We sort of let the momentum 

swing their way,” Yano said. “We 
couldn’t get enough stops.”

Poor shooting hurt the Tritons 
Friday night. UCSD finished the 
game on 28 percent (17–59) shoot-
ing from the field, sank only one 
out of 11 three-point attempts and 
hit just 58 percent (7–12) of their 
free throws. 

After this win, the red-hot 
Wildcats earned their sixth straight 
victory and currently sit in third 
place in the CCAA following this 
past weekend. 

The next night, Bertsch and Seto 
both returned to the lineup for the 
Tritons and put up significant contri-
butions against Cal State Stanislaus.

“Just being able to contribute and 
[start] back where I left off was nice,” 
Seto said. 

Bertsch led the Tritons, scor-
ing 16 points, while Seto put up 15 
points, a game-high nine rebounds 
and six steals. 

But their efforts were not enough 
as again, UCSD’s shots refused to 
fall. While they hit a solid 41 percent 
(12–29) of their shots from the field 
in the first half, they made only 22 
percent (7–31) in the second period.

“We weren’t hitting anything,” 
Seto said. “It was just really difficult 
to come back when we weren’t mak-
ing anything.” 

The Tritons let the game slip away 
during a dismal shooting drought in 
the second half, in which they went 
over 12 minutes without a field goal. 
UCSD also missed three straight three-

pointers in the final 22 seconds in a 
last-ditch attempt to tie up the game. 

The Tritons have now dropped in 
the standings for the third straight 
week and face a tough road ahead 
with only six games left to climb 
their way back up to qualify for the 
CCAA championships, where only 
the top six teams will qualify. 

“I think if anything, we have a 
team who is going to fight,” Yano 
said. “We kind of just look forward 
to the next six games, [trying] to take 
every opportunity we can get.” 

UCSD will next travel to play Cal 
State Monterey Bay on Thursday, 
Feb. 13 at 7 p.m. and will close out 
their road trip at Cal State East Bay 
on Saturday, Feb. 15 at 5:30 p.m.

The Tritons came out hot in 
Sunday’s first game, finding success 
early after senior catcher Caitlin Brown 
hit in Willmon early in the game. The 
Tritons maintained their lead through-
out the game and freshman pitcher 
Alayna Brenman threw two, scoreless 
frames to end the game 6–2.

Sophomore right-handed pitcher 
Hannah Duarte started the fourth 
and final game of the series for UCSD 
on the mound by throwing three 
straight shutout innings and was 
credited with the win after pitching 
four. Triton bats racked up 14 hits in 
game four to win 9–4 and improved 
their total to 27 hits in all four games.

Against California Baptist the fol-
lowing weekend, Brenman pitched 
all seven frames of the first game 
against the Lancers, allowing only 
one run on four hits. Schneider, 
sophomore outfielder Callie Grant, 

Willmon and Brown all landed hits 
off CBU, scoring four runs for the 
Tritons in the 3–1 win.

CBU took the lead early in game 
two with four runs scored in the first 
inning. Sophomore catcher Katie 
Saunders hit a solo homer to cen-
ter, putting UCSD up by one in the 
second frame, but the offense would 
only produce one more run for the 
remainder of the game. UCSD had 
13 hits in the loss but were unable to 
score enough batters to come back 
from the early deficit.

The Tritons continue their home-
stand with a four-game series against 
Chico State to kick off conference 
play. The first pitch is scheduled for 
1 p.m. on Feb. 14 for games one and 
two. A doubleheader on Saturday will 
close out the series starting at 10 a.m.

the inbound pass, Dyer cut wide and 
drained a 16-foot fadeaway buzzer 
beater to steal the win. 

Dyer finished the game with 17 
points, nine boards, just shy of a dou-
ble-double. McCann finished with 23 
points, six rebounds and four assists. 
Sophomore guard Aleks Lipovic also 
contributed 12 points on a 4–9 per-
formance from three-point territory.

“I thought our guys played with 
a lot of heart and toughness,” head 
coach Eric Olen said to the UCSD 
Athletics Department last Friday. 
“We continued to compete and fight 
back when we got behind. We really 
put ourselves in position to have a 
chance, and we were fortunate to 
make some plays at the end. I’m 
really proud of our effort.”

The following night, the Tritons 
would extend its winning streak to 

three games by upsetting Cal State 
Stanislaus, dealing the Warriors 
only their second loss at home. The 
Tritons came out strong, taking 
the 39–32 halftime lead. The game 
would become more competitive 
in the second half as the Warriors 
attempted to make a comeback. With 
less than 2:43 remaining, the UCSD 
lead was cut to only two points. The 
ensuing possessions would be an 
exchange of free throws, with UCSD 
shooting 73 percent in the second 
half and the Warriors only shooting 
62 percent from the charity stripe. 

Four Tritons scored in double dig-
its. McCann had 16 points, dished 
out seven assists and grabbed seven 
rebounds. Freshman guard Adam 
Klie contributed 12 points and seven 
rebounds. Fresh off his heroic per-
formance the past night, Dyer had 
14 points and eight rebounds, while 
Lipovic matched his previous night’s 

scoring with 12 points.
“We played with great energy, 

effort and toughness,” Olen said. 
“We beat a very good team on the 
road tonight. We played solid basket-
ball all weekend, and we held on to 
get a tough, hard-fought win tonight.”

The Tritons have won five of their 
last six games. They continue to play 
on the road next weekend when they 
visit Cal State Monterey Bay (6–10) 
and Cal State East Bay (4–12). The 
Tritons defeated Monterey Bay and 
East Bay earlier in the season at 
home, winning comfortably on both 
occasions. Now a little bit over half-
way through the season and still 
one position behind San Francisco 
State (9–7), the remaining games 
will likely determine UCSD’s post-
season fate.

Beating the 
Buzzer

After splitting its two-game homestand last week, the UCSD men’s basketball team pulled off 
two upsets on its weekend road trip, 
defeating Chico State at the buzzer and 
defeating Cal State Stanislaus 67–65 
in another close game. The Tritons 
improve to 8–8 in California Collegiate 
Athletic Association play, still one posi-
tion behind San Francisco State (8–7) 
for the final postseason spot.

On Friday night, the Tritons came 
out slow, digging themselves into a 
12-point hole and trailing Chico State 

for the entire first half. But, UCSD 
battled back to keep the game close 
and grabbed a 57–54 lead after senior 
James McCann’s three-pointer with 
7:11 remaining. The game had several 
lead changes after that but sophomore 
guard Hunter Walker’s pair of clutch 
free throws tied the score at 64–64 with 
1.6 seconds left in the game. 

As the Wildcats inbounded the ball 
on their own half, sophomore forward 
Drew Dyer’s defensive pressure forced 
Chico to overthrow the ball, giving the 
Tritons possession. With McCann on 

The Tritons opened their 2014 
season with four wins in a four-
game series against Western Oregon 
University Feb. 1 to Feb. 2. On the 
first day of the series, the Tritons 
took back-to-back, walk-off vic-
tories, thanks largely to a strong 
offensive performance. The follow-
ing day, the Tritons completed its 
sweep as UCSD repeated its success 
at bat while the pitching staff kept 
the Wolves at bay.

UCSD continued its 18-game 
homestand with a doubleheader 
against California Baptist University 
last Wednesday, Feb. 5 splitting the 
two-game series.

“It was a really great start to 
the season,” senior outfielder Kirsten 
Willmon said. “We had great perfor-
mances up and down the lineup.”

Willmon was named the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Player of the Week for 
the week of Feb. 2. Willmon led 
the Triton offense against Western 
Oregon, racking up nine hits, a dou-
ble, a triple, 12 total bases, five runs 
scored and a .646 batting average in 

the four consecutive victories over 
the Wolves.

“Getting selected for Player of the 
Week was really exciting,” Willmon 
said. “I’ve never been selected before, 
and it’s a great honor.”

Despite the offensively driven 
performances featured over the 
weekend, the first game started with 
strong pitching from both teams. 
The first run wasn’t recorded until 
the fifth inning, when Western 
Oregon pulled ahead by three. The 
end of the sixth inning had the game 
tied at 3–3 after the Triton offense 
mounted a comeback in the bottom 
of the inning. Sophomore left-hand-
ed pitcher Alexis Edwards shutout 
the Wolves on the mound in the 
top of the seventh and an RBI triple 
from Willmon gave the Tritons a 4–3 
walk-off win in the bottom.

In the second game, UCSD’s 11–3 
win in the afternoon was cut short in 
the sixth inning via the mercy rule. 
Again, the Tritons managed a walk-
off as redshirt freshman, first base 
Emma Schneider sent the ball out of 
the park to bring in two runs.

The UCSD women’s basketball 
team wrapped up a tough weekend 
with a 55–42 loss to Chico State on 
Friday, Feb. 7 followed by a 69–65 
defeat by Cal State Stanislaus the 
following night. The pair of road 
losses extends UCSD’s recent los-
ing skid to four games. With an 
8–8 record in California Collegiate 
Athletic Association play, UCSD has 
now fallen to eighth in the 12-team 
conference.

In its first matchup of the week-
end, UCSD entered the contest 
against Chico State without starters 
junior forward McKennan Bertsch 
and leading scorer, junior guard 
Miranda Seto. However, the Tritons 
appeared to have little trouble early 
on, starting the game off with a com-
manding 12–0 lead. 

“We already knew we were deal-
ing with some adversity [playing 
without Seto and Bertsch], but we 
started off really well in the first 
five minutes,” senior guard Stephanie 
Yano said. 

Without two key starters, sopho-
more center Emily Morris stepped up 

to fill in the gap, finishing the night 
with a double-double (12 points, 13 
rebounds). 

In spite of the hot start, Chico 
State came alive midway through the 
first half, responding with a 9–0 run 

of its own. The Wildcats would close 
out the half with a 24–20 lead. 

In the second half, the Tritons 
kept the Wildcats within reach, but
