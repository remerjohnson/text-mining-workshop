Elections 

Bad, timing, 
say candidates 

By MICHELE BIDWELL 
FHtun. Edit", 

With the elections being held 
in just a few days, the consensus 
of many of the Associated Stud-
ents (A.S.) candidates is that 
filing and campaign procedures 
of the present and previous weeks 
are, and have been very poorly 
structured. According to most of 
the candidates interviewed, the 
timing for filing and campaigning 
is bad and, to some candidates, 
the one week of campaign time is 
too short. 

"I found the filing process 
hectic," said Alex Wonl, candi-
date for Third Senior Senator. "I 
would prefer to have it not on 
tenth week but backed up a week 
or so," he added. 

One candidate, who chooses 
to remain anonymous, said, "The 
pressure of tryinl to do campaign-
ing all at once the fint week 
made me think that maybe it's 
just too much to do. With getting 
slates 'together and crashinl clas-
ses, I don't · think ifs enouah 
time." 8ecJuse of the prenure, 
this candidate may to choose to 
drop out of the race. 

As stated in the election bylaws 
of the A.S. Constitution, annual 
A.S. elections must be held on 
the Tuesday and Wednesday of 
the second week of the Spring 
quarter. With this law in effect, 
the normal procedure requires 
all prospective candidates to file 
their petitiions either during the

number of signatures for each 
petition must also be obtained 
by the Monday deadline. No 
filing or campaigning may be 
done over spring break. The 
candidates are then allowed one 
week to campaign one week be-
fore the elections. 

With the filing process being 
held mainly during the tenth 
week of winter quarter, Bob 
DeCarli, a Services and Enter-
prises Commisioner candidate 
argued, "I think getting signa-
tures durinl tenth week, when 
people are trying to study for 
finals, is bad." 

Mary Fisher, a Revelle Junior 
Senator candidate agreed;"Finals 
were a problem ... it was hard to 
find people (and) let the members 
of my slate together." 

The fact that campaigning 
must be done the week after 
spring break also posed some 
problems for many of the candi-
datel. "The first week of school

A.S. rejects Greek 
campus housing 
By CYNTHIA CHESY 
s.u Wrlt.r 

Endorsement for campus 
Greek and co- op housing was 
rejected by the Alternative 
Housing (AH) Committee last 
night at the AS Council meeting. 
Other issues raised included an 
allocation to the Asian Pacific 
Student Union (APSU) and a 
parking shuttle expansion. 

Dave Marchick, AS presi-
ent, reported that while the A H 
committee recommended an 
international house and a cul-
tural house on campus to 
Chancellor Atkinson, they ad-
vised the administration to not 

. support Greek campus housing. 
Instead, they suggested that the 
chancellor help Greek orlaniza-
tions get bank loans for various 
activities. 

The committee also found it 
"virtually impossible" to have 
co- op housing on campus, 
according to Marchick . "If 
anyone has any comments on 
this [committee] draft, see me by 
April 22," Marchick said. 

In other council announce-
ments, UCSD commuters will 
soon be able to avoid campus 
parking problems when the 
parking shuttle expands to areas 
in La Jolla, including Gilman 
Drive, according to David 
Manheim, Vice President of 
Administration. The bad news is 
that parking rates will go up $3 

per month, according to 
Manheim. 

In other business, $450 from 
General Unallocated AS funds 
was alloted to the APSU for 
members to attend a conference 
in Hawaii; a reallocation of 
$1,200 to the UCSD Triton 
Yearbook organization for print-
ing costs was postponed for 
amending and voting until next 
week's meeting and a request for 
a council vote on a S60S al-
location for 11,000 Guardian 
newspaper inserts for External 
Affairs was postponed. 

The AS endorsement of a credit 
union in the new Student Center 
was passed with one amendment. 
The statement submitted by 
Marchick read that the University 
and State Employees Credit 
Union will manage and operate 
the credit union with "appro-
priate" student involvement. 
"There will be another bank on 
campus ... and it will provide 
check ina and loans for students," 
Marchick said. 

Next week's voting includes a 
proposal which will allow the 
university to lease a space to 
KSDO, a local news radio station, 
on their transmitter, in exchange 
for internships at KSDO, money, 
and other benefits. 

The council meetings which 
are open to public input, are held 
at 6:30 p.m., Wednesdays, in the 
North Conference Room of the 
Student Center. ~

Crabtree 
hearing 
closed 
By PETER MESSROBIAN 
N.w.EdJtor 

Nearly fifty people attempted 
in vain to attend a closed judicial 
hearing held last night to deter-
mine whether or not UCSD stu-
dent Kristen Crabtree is guilty of 
assaulting a University police of-
ficer. 

However, due to the late hour, 
the meeting was adjourned after 
midnight before a decision was. 
Deliberations are scheduled to 
continue on Wednesday, April 
13 at 7 pm. 

The decision to bar the public 
and the press from last night's 
hearing, opposed by Crabtree, 
was nominally made by Judicial 
Board Chair Eric Basil. However, 
it was Third Dean Luis Ramirez 
who actually made the choice. 

"I made that decision" Ramirez 
said. "He [Basil] was involved in 
the rationale in making the 
decision. " 

Before the hearing, which 
began ~t 7:30 pm, Crabtree com-
plained about the fact it was 
closed. Asked if she expected a 
fair hearing, she said "they 
already haven't [given me one]; 
by denying my rights they're 
denied me any hope of having a 
fair hearing." 

According to Ramirez, vir-
tually all Judicial Board hearings 
are denied. 

The charges against Crabtree 
stem from an incident that oc-
curred earlier this year at a lecture 
given by a Contra spokesman. 
After his presentation, he was 
approached by one of Crabtree's 
friends. The police restrained the 
individual, and Crabtree claims 
she attempted to help him. She is 
accused of assaulting one of the 
police officers, a charge she 
denies. 

Andy Howard,a Warren senior 
and friend of Crabtree's, claimed 
to have interviewed all the 
witnesses to the incident. "Every 
single person I interviewed was 
emphatic that she [Kristen] did 
not assault anybody," Howard 
said. 

Crabtree refused to discuss 
what happened that night, but 
she did brandish some 200 letters 
she said were written by UCSD 
expressing theie support 
for her. Calling the charges 
·against her "bogus", Crabtree 
said she was being "blackballed" 
bacause of an incident last year 
that involved a tussle between 
her and an FBI agent, and 
resulted in her aHegedly biting 
the agent. That case was thrown 
out of court once, but has been 
reintroduced by the government. 

According to Dean Ramirez, 
if Crabtree is found luilty, the 
Judicial Board, composed en-
tirely of students, may impost a 
penalty as severe as expUlsion 
from UCSD. Ramirez said it was 
"very unlikely that it [the hearin~ 
will result in an expulsion." lliJ

Elections 
Continued from pap 1 
do it [campaigning] later in the 
quarter, it runs into midterms." . 

Even with this fact in mind, 
most candidates agreed that the 
beainnin, of the third week would 
be a better time to hold the 
elections, either allowing two 
weeks for the candidates to cam-
paign, possibly extending the 
filing deadline, or allowing one 
week ",race period" after spring 
break. 

"Given the fact that we have to 
just ri,ht into classes," said Rick 
Mersereau, a candidate for Public 
Relatrons Commissioner, "the 
timing for campaigning is not 
very good." Mersereau argued 
that the second week of the 
quarter would be better timing 
because "by then, both the candi-
dates and the people would be 
ready for the campaign." 

Kei Sellers, this year's Election 
Manager, aBrees that the filinl 
period should be lon,er. "I think 
that it could be a lot more or-
ganized, "she added. At the same 
time, Sellers PRinted out another 
reason for tft elections being 
held early in the quarter - Open 
House. Scheduled for the end of 
April, Sellers suuested that the 

. elections and Open House "are 
probably the two biu~st events 
oncampus,"To hold the elections 
any later in the quarter would be 
to cut into the plannin, of the 
Open House, SeHen added. 

Although the majority of the 
candidates are displeased with 
the filing and campaigning pro-
cesses as they stand at present, 
the bottom-line rests on the elec-
tion bylaws in the A.S. Consti-
tution. Before any procedure can 
be changed concerning the elec-
tion, the bylaws must be chanaed, 
and accordinB to Sellen, that 
would be"a very lona and drawn-
out prooes~." ~

Soviet speaker assails 'Mafia-
type' U.S.S.R. bureaucracy 
Continued frOID pale J 
'sovietize' and 'sovietization, 'be-
cause a country run by soviets, 
or "committees of workers, sol-
diers, and intellectuals," was the 
original intent of the leaders of 
the Bolshevik Revnlution. 

Tairnov believes that the 
USSR was taken off the path to 
'sovietization' with the rise of 
Josef Stalin to power. "Despite 
the fact that we lived in peace for 
40 years, our system has been 
predominantly Stalinist - total-
itarian, in some cases." 

He added that most Soviets 
"knew that one day thin,s would 
change," but they also knew that, 
'"unfortunately, "they would have 
to wait, and that it might take 
generations . "That's again an 
indication that our constitution 
- our system - doesn't work," 
he added. "We don't have the 
flexibility and the democratic 
institutions which would bring 
legitimate change . .. in the party 
and in the state. The bureau-
cracy is what still continues." 

And, Tairnovsees the bureau-
cracy as a product of the Stalin 
era, when such a system made it 
possible for the dictator to con-
trol every aspect of Soviet society. 
The fact that the bureaucracy 
"still continues" is one Tairnov 
attsibutes to "the lost dream of 
power of ·the Soviets," power 
taken by a bureaucracy that con-
trols every level of government 

change the "much-centralized 
system" in which someone who 
seeks to fight corrupt bureau-
crats must "eventually come to 
Moscow because you can't fight 
them alone." 

Tairnov also made it clear that 
Gorbachev did not intend to 
carry out reforms and changes 
only on the home front, but also 
hoped to improve the Soviet 

nuclear conflict without the 
Soviet Union suffering similar 
fate. 

Tairnov believes that this atti-
tude had changed. He believes 
that there is a "new generation of 
military leaders" that sees nego-
tiation with the West as more 
beneficial to the Soviet Union 
than a new nuclear arms build-
up, which would take further toll 

"Despite the fact that we lived in peace for 40 
years, our system has been predominantly 
Stalinist - totalitarian,. in some cases." 

UnIon's relations with other 
countries and make progress in 
nuclear disarmament. 

',(Perestroika] is also a process 
in which we want to involve our 
friends," he said. "We think that 
we can go ahead with the disar-
mament issues." He added that 
signihcant progress had already 
been made in his country ·with 
regard to disarmament because, 
during the 70s, the Soviet mil-
itary establishment would not 
even consider the possibility of 
"mutual destruction." They still 
believe that Soviet military 
superiority would allow them to 
destroy the enemy during a 

-Tair Tairnov 

on a weak national economy. 
"I would say that this is a 

renaissance in Soviet society, "he 
concluded. "There have been 
remarkable changes so far . .. for 
the first time the younger genera-
tion in my country are watching 
television and they are seeing the 
leaders of the Bolshevik Revo-
luation of whom they have n~v~r 
heard of before. In old days, in 
textbOOks, including the history 
of the Communist Party, [the 
content] was a 100 percent falsi-
fication that was begun in the 20s 
and 30s under Stalin. Now the 
history books are beginning to 
tell the truth. .. JifJ 

in the Soviet Union. 1------------------------_ 
"There are ministers, party 

leaders, and they are in the 
Supreme Soviet, and they are 
not responsible in the true sense 
which the [Supreme Soviet] 
should be responsible," he 
explained. "So we face today -a 
real crisis in terms of our politi-
cal system, and, as a result, in I 
terms of our economic svstem." 

Tairnov concluded that Peres-
troika involved decentralizing the 
Soviet government in order to 
combat the entrenched bureau-
cracy that has "established itself 
within the form of the Mafia-
type gangster, in the case of[fac-
tory] plants around the Soviet 
Union."

Hunter S. Thompson 
Surprise Dinner Guest 

O nly 45 percent of the precincts had reported last Saturday, and Michael Dukakis was still running dead even, on paper, with Jesse Jackson, who was said by the wizards and the 
smart people to be a 2-to-1 underdog in Michigan ... Dukakis had a 
lock on it , they said : He had the staff people, he had the money, he 
was coming off that big win on Super Tuesday ... The hog had 
emerged from the tunnel, they said . Dukakis was on a roll . The train 
was leaving the station, and the party pros were scrambling to get 
aboard . Yessir, it was the Wabash Cannonball all over again: Even 
Bill Bradley fell for it. 

Bradley, the senior senator from New Jersey and a genuine dark 
horse in his own right , was persuaded by persons unknown, at the 
last moment, to endorse Dukakis and "give him that one final boost 
he needs to get over the hump." 

Bradley believed it, along with a lot of other working professionals 
and they were all staggering around like winos when the sun went 
down on Saturday and took Dukakis with it . Jackson even won 
Ann Arbor, where the white / black voter registration numbers run 
about 99-1 . The whole southern tier of the state, with a IO percent 
black vote, was effectively lost to Dukakis by the time cocktail hour 
ended in Lansing. 

Dukakis went belly up before the evening news came on in San 
Francisco. With less than 50 percent of the precincts reporting, he 
saw that he was doomed and crawled out of town like a snake. 

This was, after all , his second consecutive loss -in a crucial nor-
theastern "industrial state" to a greedy black preacher from either 
Chicago or South Carolina who never ran for sheriff anywhere and 
with no credentials at all as a presidential candidate, except that he 
believes in the American political system and takes democracy 
seriously . Jesse has no more business running for president than I do 
but he is doing it, and he is doing it a lot better than some of the 
smartest hot rods in the business ... And if he ever gets to the White 
House, Richard Perryman might finally be crowned as the true king 
of rock and roll. 

T he party pros are not looking forward to a gang war at the convention at Atlanta . Two or three crazed ballots in prime time would give the Republicans a handle and a hammer and 
a whipsaw all at once. "The last thing we need is another 'McGovern 
convention,' "they say to each other in the back rooms and bistros of 
Georgetown, as they plot this new campaign. "We have a lot offreaks 
in our party, but that 's no reason they should all be on prime-time 
TV, like they were in '72." 

Indeed . It was horrible. I was there, and so were a lot of other 
people who are no longer functional in big-time politics. George lost 
by something like 24 points, the worst beating in American politics 
since George Washington ran for a second term. 

But what they forget about McGovern is that he put together a 
national staff from Frank Mankiewicz and Gary Hart down to 
12-year-old volunteers in places like Pittsburgh and Pismo Beach 
that is still the only real nucleus of idealism and true believers in 
Democratic politics today ... Jimmy Carter's "peanut brigade" 
doesn't have any annual reunions, and most of the people who 
worked for Fritz Mondale will claim they went to Bora Bora or 
maybe even jail that year. 

But McGovern's people, and I am one ofthem, still wear that brief 
and brutal experience like a tattoo that looks better every year. I ran 
into one of them the other day in the kitchen at the Woody Creek 
Tavern, and he said that "working on the McGovern campaign was 
still the best thing I ever did in my life." 

I asked him who he was going to vote for this year, and he said, 
"Nobody." 

Once you've walked with the king man, it's hard to hang around 
with punks. 

"But I like Jesse," he said. "He walks tall and he's stone crazy and I 
like him yeah, J could vote for Jesse; I might even stand in line to do 
it, like they did in Detroit." 

T here is another theory floating around out there in what Fitz-gerald called that "vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night." It is a 
kind of underground Democrat point of view that says the next four 
years are going to be such an economic disaster, for sure, that it is a 
far, far better thing in the long run to let Bush get elected and take the 
whole load of blame for it - a ghastly depression, with millions gone 
mad with despair and blind hatred for whoever caused it to happen. 

No Democrat should have to bite that bullet, they say. Give the 
"trickle-down" people a taste of what is really trickling down. Let 
them wallow in their own greedy mess, and in 1992 we will take over 
by default and the Greedheads will flee into the swamps, leaving their 
songs to pay their debts and their daughters to remember them as fat 
green snakes coiled tightly around their arms forever. 

But that is a grim way to have to look at politics in a country where 
Victory or Death has always been the only attitude to take when 
things get serious. The idea of rolling over and laying low until the 
next presidential race runs contrary to the American experience ... It 
also ignores the long-term reality of the McGovern campaign, which 
suffered a disastrous loss to Nixon, but not for long. He was a crook 
and a thug and a gun-drunk, and twO years later we swarmed all over 
the bastard and ran him out of town. 

That too was politics. It ain't alljust a gameforfixers and lawyers 
and thieves. Every once in awhile it can take you for a ride like one of 
those big 12-cylinder Jaguars that will scare your passengers into a 
coma.

Football 
Sexist 
Editor: 

Students who are debating the 
pros and cons of the proposed 
fee increase to support a football 
team should consider the follow-
ing point: since college football 
teams are made up of male stu-
dents exclusively, any fee increase 
to support such a team is an insi-
dious form of monetary dis-
crimination against women stu-
dents and athletes. 

A fee increase designated to 
support a male-only sports pro-
gram at UCSD must be balanced 
by more funding for women's 
sports programs. Otherwise, 
UCSD will start down the road 
taken by the nation's traditional 
football colleges - these col-
leges often spend five to ten 
times as much on men's sports as 
they spend on women's sports. 

In addition to considering this 
argument against the fee increase, 
I hope students will ask them-
selves which is more exciting: the 
prospect of having a third-rate 
football team (which costs $45 
per year) , or the possibility that 
UCSD will have another national 
championship water polo team. 
Yes , it 's true, UCSD has already 
won a national championship in 
women 's water polo-and that's 
something to write home about!

Editor: 

I saw a guy cruising through 
Revelle Plaza on a skateboard. 
He was approached by an officer, 
forcibly handcuffed and taken 
away. The conduct of the officer 
in the course of this incident was 
frightening. He was aggressive 
and hostile in his manner of car-
rying out this "procedure. n 

1 do not know the details of 
this incident other than what I 
have described and I do not 
intend (in this letter) to defend 
the skateboarder or argue about 
the no bike/ skateboard rule. 

My reaction of shock and fear 
is the issue here. I am too sensi-
tive to dismiss the fact that a fel-
low student was subjected to 
psychological and physical abuse 
that seemed greater in propor-
tion to the event which provoked 
it. 

I, too, could be subject to such 

WELCOME TO 

treatment. Occasionally, I take 
the risk of getting a citation and 
fine in this world. I make U-
turns, I park in loading zones, [ 
ride my bicycle through Revelle 
Plaza . In the laUercase. by virtue 
of what I witnessed on Friday, I 
realized a potentially traumatic 
and hostile incident could result 
from my actions. Perhaps 
someone can enlighten me 
regarding the details of this 
incident.

On Tuesday, Feb. 23, A.S. 
President David Marchick ad-
dressed the Warren Residence 
Life Staff on various matters 
concerning the ASUCSD. A 
concern was raised by several 
staff members about the prob-

the university's diverse (eth-
nically, economically, ideologi-
cally) student population on the 
A.S. Council. 

Marchick's response was that 
the A.S. had done an out-reach 
program. Yet one program is not 
enough. Many of us felt that he 
had tip-toed around the ques-
tion. His attitude was: "We bad

CommentarY., 
Soaps 
Addictive 
By DULCE AMOR T. LEDINA 

I t's a beautiful day; the tree nearby gently caresses the window and you can see neighbors outside talking. 
All of a sudden, the clock strikes twelve 

and t}iis placid picture is interrupted by the 
slamming of the door and the sound of books 
falling to the ground. Three college students 
rush madly in front of the television set and 
one quickly turns it on to the Days of Our 
Lives. iQSisting on silence. • 

Elsewhere, households appear to have been 
overtaken by aliens because the vacuum is 
turned off, dishes are piled high from lunch-
time, the churning of the washing machine 
ceases to exist and the only noticeable sound 
is the TV. 

These are the soap opera addicts. It is an 
addiction like drugs because one show is not 
enough to satisfy this compUlsion. The story-
lines have one motive - to entice the addicted 
viewer to tunc in tomorrow and the next day, 
and the next day. The characters on the soap 
are entertaining and many find it exciting to 
substitute the lives of their favorite stars for 
their own lives as an escape from domestic 
drudgery. 

I am a full-fledged member of "Soap Opera 
Anonymous" and I hate the feeling of being 
controlled by my soap. Many may feel that 
this problem is not serious enough and may 
not pertain to them. Big deal if someone is 
glued to a TV set for several hours everyday. 
Why should that be such a problem? 

Sometimes, my friends and I find ourselves 
discussing the characters and their storylines 
onDays as if they really exist (in our minds 
they do) and we have even vowed to never 
take a class between the hour of noon and I 
pm because it would conflict with the show 

time of our soap. We would even turn on our 
answering machine so that the phone would 
not distract us'from our show. 

It does sound pretty silly and I often won-
dered why we do these things. Nothing could 
ever interfere with watching our soap and 
everything was required to be scheduled 
around it so we could watch it. Gradually, it 
was becoming installed in our daily routines 
and we joined the legions of soap opera 
addicts with nothing better to do but feed our 
uncontrollable addiction. 

Being stuck on a soap or several soaps 
meant daily watching, so it was not possible 
to do any other activity during soap time. We 
became lifeless and unable to contribute any-
thing positive to ourselves or to society. I 
have been a faithful soap viewer since fifth 
grade and I do not really want to sever my ties 
with my soap. After nearly nine years, one 
develops a sense of responsibility and loyalty 
to the show and daytime drama, but at the 
same time, like many soap addicts,l was tired 
of being controlled by them. So what are the 
alternatives? Is there really a cure for this 
addiction? 

If you need the escapism that soap operas 
provide, read a good, juicy romantic novel. 
However, though some of us were born to

read, some of us just do not have the passion 
and even the capacity to read a book and 
visualize the context of the novel. We take the 
easy way out. We would rather have someone 
else analyze it for us and we watch the final 
hypothesis, then we use our own imagina-
tions and picture it in our minds. 

Another idea to get over this addiction 
could be the purchase of magazines. When I 
was in high school, I use to purchase Soap 
Opera Digesl, .a magazine which offered a 
two-week sypnosis of every soap opera on 
television and it was available at any local 
supermarket. If! did not have enough money, 
J would purchase a newspaper for a quarter 
and turn to the entertainment section where 
they offered supplements of the storyline. 
However, this too posed a problem because 
seeing it and reading it were two different 
matters. After reading about what had hap-
pened on my soap, I tried everything to see it 
first hand for myself on TV. 

In drug addiction, addicts have a rehabili-
tation program in which they gradually ease 
themselves from drugs. With soap opera 
addiction, the same applies. You can begin 
easing away from your favorite show by 
watching only Monday and Friday because 
you will get all the storyline information you 
need during these two days. Any soap viewer 
will agree that these are the best days to watch 
soaps because the producers make the story-
lines more provocative to entice the viewer to 
tune in after the weekend. But what happens 
after Monday? Usually, Monday has a cliff-
hanger to be revealed on Tuesday and once 
again you fjnd yourself trapped ill this end-
less cycle of tuning in day after day to satisfy 
your curiosity. 

The solution is quite simple: find some-
thing else to occupy your time. For example, 
plan a scheduled activity while your soap 
opera is on the air -like a hair appointment, 
shopping with friends, early spring cleaning, 
volunteer work, playing a tennis game, enrol-
ling in a class, or running errands that have 
been put off. This way, you are obligated to 
go somewhere or to do something.

OPINION 

Marchick 
Continued from pale 4 
not our Lthe A.S.'s] problem 
anymore." Yet is it obvious the 
problem still exists, and we feel it 
is the obligation of the A.S. to 
search for a solution to the prob-
lem, and not just disregard it. 

Marchick had not seriously 
addressed the problem in the 
meeting. Later in the evening, he 
telephoned one of the resident 
advisors involved. His tone was 
condescending, and he proceeded 
to utter slurs against the student 
populations in question. Among 
other thin., he stated that these 
students had a "lack of courage." 

We believe the problem of 
under representation lies with an 
A.S. that has not demonstrated 
to the various ethnic groups/ or-
ganizations on campus a con-
cern for their issues nor a wil-
lingness to listen to their specific 
needs and goals. In his telephone 
conversation, Marchick illustra-
ted his ignorance of the problem 
as well as a lack of sensitivity 
towards these students. Logically 
it fOllows that if one is dealing 
with an A.S. that has not dis-
played the sensitivity, the under-
standing, nor the support for 
one's concerns, one would not 
desire to be involved with tbat 
A.S. 

The A.S. is supposed to be the 
voice for students, and therefore 
sbould be representative of the 
university'S diverse student pop-
ulation.

Los Alamos Laboratory to 
develop space reactor fuel 
By JOHN A. WEBSTER 

LOS ALAMOS- Fuel pellets 
for ground-testing of small nuc-
lear reactors designed for use in 
space will be fabricated at Los 
Alamos National Laboratory. 

Following an extensive eval-
uation , a technical review panel 
recently approved the produc-
tion ofthe uranium nitride pellets 
for the SP-lOO program, a na-
tional effort to develop the tech-
nology for putting a reactor in 
space. 

John Hanson, SP-1OO labor-
atory coordinator at Los Alamos, 
said the approval marked the 
successful culmination of the fuel 
for a real reactor," said Hanson, 
of the Lab's Nuclear Technology 
and Engineering Division. 

The SP-100 Ground Engineer-
ing System project is managed 
by Los Alamos and the Jet Pro-
pUlsion Laboratory in Pasadena, 
Calif. Los Alamos also is charged 
with fuels development, while 
other labs and companies around 
the country are responsible for 
other technical aspects of the 
project. 

The Department of Energy, 
Strategic Defense Initiative Or-
ganizationand the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administra-
tion are sponsoring the ground 
testing of SP-IOO space systems 
and sub-systems, including the 

reactor. 
The SP- I 00 reactor is intended 

for space-based defense and 
scientific applications that re-
quire more energy than can be 
obtained through solar cells, bat-
teries or radioisotopes, or require 
the long lifetime and solar in-
dependence of a nuclear reactor 
power source. 

The reactor, which could pro-
duce tens to hundreds of kilo-
watts of electricity, is being de-
signed to operate at full power 
for up to seven years, making it 
suitable for projects ranging from 
deep space probes to ferrying 
supplies from one Earth orbiter 
to another. 

Commercial nuclear reactors 
use uranium oxide as the primary 
fuel. Uranium nitride has higher 
density, meaning it can produce 
more power per unit of volume, 
and higher thermal conductivity, 
allowing it to transfer heat more 
·effici .. ntly than uranium oxide. 

"Basically, it enables you to 
build a smaller reactor core, 
which is important in space," 
said Bruce Matthews, leader of 
the fuels section of the Nuclear 
Fuel and Isotope Separation 
Group at Los Alamos. 

Matthews , whose section de-
veloped the new fuel, said ur-
anium nitride had been consi-
dered as a possible power source 
for a space reactor years ago, but 

research and development halted 
when an earlier space reactor 
program was dropped in the late 
1960s. 

The program was revived in 
the early 19805 with a demand 
for higher power-level sources in 
space for defense and scientific 
missions, and the Los Alamos 
effort to reexamine the potential 
of uranium nitride and develop a 
method of fabricating it began in 
1983, 

The Lab team solved most of 
the technical problems within a 
year, then performed a series of 
tests and analyses and escalated 
the process from "bench-top" 
fabrication to a pilot project, 
Matthews said . 

The uranium nitride fuel pel-
lets are the key part of fuel pins 
that will be assembled at Los 
Alamos and shipped to the site 
of the ground tests for use in a 
reactor. 

Other fuel pin components arc 
being designed by General Elec-
systems contractor for the pro-
which also is building the reactor. 

Following the ground tests, 
fuel-fabrication technology de-
at Los Alamos will be turned 
to private industry to produce 
the fuel for future reactors that 
will be launched into space. 

Los Alamos National Labor-
atory is operated by the Univer-
sity of California for the De-
partment of Energy. ~

Geologists discover landslide 

If the C'ampus moves, 
it's Powers Fault 

By ROBERT LEONE 
Sellior St¥J Writtr 

George Shor has been a Scripps Institute of 
Oceanography (SIO) geologist for 35 years, but he 
never knew that the shortwavt radio station he 
manages as associate director of Ship Operations 
and Marine Technical Support was perched on 
top of an eons-old landslide. 

He only found out be<:ause the hill was recently 
placed under intense scrutiny by geologists who 
drilled deep holes to see what was to be sccn. "I 
used to take students out to do geophysical studies 
[on campus] but nothing like this," Shor said. 
SIO's geologist tend to look out to.sea more than 
around campus for research projects, Shor added. 

Mark Nelson, a UCSO architect and project 
manager for the Stephen Birth Aquarium-
Museum, when questioned about the landslide, 
"No, we had no idea [it was there]. Jt'sjust one of 
those things you'd run across." 

Another example of things that UCSD's build-

ers have run across is Powers Fault, Named after 
Chuck Powers, UCSD's former assistant vice 
chancellor of Design and Construction, this small 
and "probably inactive" fault was discovered 
during the building of the new Warren Apart-
ments. 

According to Shor, Powers Fault runs from the 
intersection of Genesee Avenue and 1-5 to the new 
Warren Apartments, intersects Gilman Drive 
south of the Student Center, and disappears in 
Skeleton Canyon south of Azul Street and east of 
the city-owned soccer field . It's almost entirely on 
UCSD property. 

"There's a lot of interesting geology on campus 
-we usually only find out about it when we dig 
foundations," Shor said. 

UCSD is currently creating a general geolo,ical 
survey of the campus. This will compile the results 
of aerial surveys and studies for various buildings 
into a geological map of the campus. Perhaps 
UCSO's builders won' find as much "interesting 
geology" in the future.

Youth program provides 
alternatives to the streets 
Editor's note: This article is the 
second of a two-part series on 
the Youthfor Progressprogram, 
Part one appeared in last 
Monday's edition. 

By CHAD B. SKOPP 
GIIMdiM imerlt 

Logan Youth and Family 
Services, a sub-agency of Youth 
for Progress, is located in the 
Barrio Logan area of San Diego, 
a primarily low-income region. 
The agency serves as a juvenile 
diversion program, providing 
alternatives to the limited activi-
ties available to the Barrio's 
youth. 

Its building, referred to as 
'Logan,' was originally a two-
story furniture warehouse, con-
verted by the progra m '5 founder, 
Simon Judge. Inside, there is a 
colorful mural that captures 
one's attention upon first en-
tering the agency. The picture 
depicts a native Californian 
Indian looking away from a 
serene San Diego countryside 
that evolves, from left to right, 
into a complex urban setting. 
The mural metaphorically re-
flects the conditions for many of 
Logan's clients: children that 
have been progressively isolated 
from either their families, 
schools, or communities. Like 
the Indian, according to Tony 
Ramirez, the Logan Youth and 
Family Service's director, the 
children are trying to accept 
"(transitions) in a harmonious 
way." 

Blaring top-40 music and col-
liding pool balls pervade the 
building'S first level. Worn pool 
tables stand on brown tile floors, 
occupying the attention of var-
iously-aged children who smooth-
ly survey their games, cue sticks 
in hand. Some are possibly from 
rival gangs, but once inside 
Logan they disregard their dif-

ferences. Book cases, standing 
out sharply from the tough 
atmosphere, serve as a reminder 
that there is always the oppor-
tunity for progress. Across the 
room is a boxing ring, surround-
ed by onlookers and various 
training devices, where the in-
structor, Vincente Hueso, 34, has 
trained top amateur atheletes. 

On the second level, there are 
many school desks and chairs 
positioned around the center of 
the room. This instructional 
setting is an "overflow" room for 
the Summit School. One of 23 
sites, the space is leased out by 
Logan and operated by the San 
Diego County Department of 
Education. 

The Summit program gives 
students who have missed a sub-
stantial amount of their school's 
semester, either from expUlsion 
or legal problems, the oppor-

"If our kids can't 
work, they can 't sur-
vive; if they can't 
survive, they're going 
to resort to all kinds 
of different activities." 

-Pam Peterson 
Executive director 

Youth for Progress 

tunity to earn credits and as-
similate back into their regular 
public schools. Instructed by 
Bernie Gately, the location at 
Logan has a classroom size that 
fluctuates between approxi-
mately IS to 18 students from 
grades nine through 12. Al-
though it is not accredited, many 
students stay on to graduate 
because they feel more comfor-
table there than in the hostile 

environments of their original 
schools. 

Once inside, a visitor to di-
rector Tony Ramirez's office is 
aware of his busy routine, easily 
noticing the room's sense of 
activity. "Their eyes," he com-
mented "take in the whole room, 
until they settle down, and realize 
that they came here to see me." 

Ramirez, 43, is a gentle figure, 
both adored and respected by 
Logan's youth. Playfully referred 
to as "Bear," the children have 
adorned his office with objects 
alluding to his nickname. 

Formerly an aspiring commer-
cial artist, Ramirez held up his 
dreams, devoting the last 13 years 
to working as a direct service 
person in community-based or-
ganizations. 

Raised in Logan Heights since 
age three, Ramirez shared exper-
iences similar to those of the 
children he now instructs. "I 
[have] got a lot of insight in 
regards to what makes up Logan 
Heights," he explained. By age 
18, he was given the opportunity 
to work in a recreation center 
involved with the local gang, 
which he also happened to be 
"running with" at the time. 
Active with this gang since junior 
high school, Ramirez, with the 
infl uence of a concerned teacher, 
eventually relinquished his ties 
to it by age 21. 

It was at tbe recreation cente) 
that his interest in social work 
was sparked through activities 
such as painting over graffiti to 
coordinating baseball games be-
tween the local gang and police 
officers. He knew that he could 
lend his own personai exper-
iences to working and relating 
with troubled youth, for like 
many of them, he too had felt 
" ... the hurt, the pain [in] feeling 
like the outcast. to 

"I decided that I could do 
something better with my life, to 
influence some of the young 

Tony Ramirez. the Logan Youth and Family Services director grew 
up in the Logan Heights area and finds that he can relate to the 
Logan youths more effectively because he has had experiences 
similar to theirs. 

people that were growing up 
in that environment," said Ra-
mirez. Obtaining a degree in 
social welfare from San Diego 
City College, Ramirez's exper-
ience took him to the Youth for 
Progress agency. 

"When I came to Youth for 
Progress, they needed a trouble-
shooter to bring the Chicano 
popUlation to the Lemon Grove 
area," Ramirez explained. After 
two-and-a-half years with that 
agency, he transferred (in 1983) 
to 'the Logan site as the assistant 
coordinator; since 1985 he has 
served as Logan's program co-
ordinator. 

Most of Ramirez's clients are 
referred to him by police and 
probation officers, juvenile 
courts, schools, and family mem-
bers. The target population of 
the program is comprised of 
adolescents between the aacs of 
10 and 18 years. Ethnically, the 
youth are 85 percent Hispanic, 
10 percent Black and 5 percent 
white or Asian, with a male 
popUlation of 83 percent. 

Most of the children at Logan 
Youth and Family Services are 

poor, under-educated, and lack. 
English and Spanish language 
skills. The majority of Logan's 
clients read at a level of three 
grades below standard, while 
about half of the adolescents 
drop out of hi,h school. Nearly 
all of the clients are unemployed, 
livin, below Federal Poverty 
Guidelines, and have used drugs 
at one time or anotber. About 
half of the youths claim to be 
involved with gangs. 

The non-profit service pro-
vides counselin, and other or-
ganized activities to the adoles-
cents because they are con-
sidered to be at a "high-risk" of 
becoming involved in illegal acti-
vities, or have already been 
labeled as "delinquent." 

The program is designed to 
intervene in the children's be-
havioral cycle, whereby prevent-
ing wayward behavior. Youth 
for Progren believes that 
through the positive activities 
tbat they provide, their clients 
are much less likely to seek 
penonal acknowled.ment and

self-esteem through anti-social 
behavior. 

Seeing between 40 to 50 clients 
a month, Logan's two staff 
members provide an individual-
ized treatment program for every 
youngster. The agency offers 
many different programs such as 
individual and family counseling, 
job referrals, and tutoring. In 
their literacy training program 
entitled "El Puente" (The 
Bridge), the staff works with 
clients, trying to improve their 
attitudes about themselves and 
what they are reading. 

"We've found that just by 
doing that, we can increase a 
youngster's reading score, with-
OJt even providing remedial 
training," explained Pam Peter-
son, executive director of Youth 
for Progress. Logan also pro-
vides court assistance, defending 
their clients in cases where their 
right to a public education is in 
jeopardy. 

Maintaining ties with his ar-
tisitic friends, Ramirez allo man-
ages to bring in local artists to 
the Logan site where they con-
duct beginnina muralist classes; 
these coune have served as an 
alternative to graffiti. Some of 
the painten have even arranged 

community art projects for 
Logan's clients . 

The center docs not only offer 
assistance to adolescents. If a 
senior citizen is in need of emo-
tional support in overcoming the 
death of a spouse, assistance 
with translating a document, or 
help with food stamps, they can 
find aid at Logan. "We don't 
limit our services," Peterson 
added. 

The agency also works to dis-
solve cultural barriers that in-
hibit adolescents'actions. Direc-
tor Ramirez tries to promote 
activities such as scuba diving 
and sailing because his clients 
sometimes feel uncomfortable at 
many of the public water facil-
ities. "They feel that if you go to 
the beach, you've got to be Anglo 
and wear [fancy] t-shirts ... they 
isolate themselves, to Ramirez ex-
plained. 

One of the many reasons that 
motivate the adolescents to con-
tinue attending Logan is to carry 
on the friendships that have 
developed in the program. "I had 
moved to some of the other 
barrios and never liked them, 
until I moved out here and met 
all my friends. We all live to-
gether," said Rene Huizar, 16. 

Among Ramirez's hopes for 

the future, one is that he can 
upgrade the cliche of "saving one 
life in I 0" to a larger ratio. Also, 
Ramirez encourages that as 
Logan's youth experience suc-
cess, they don't forget their 
background, so that they will 
contribute back to the commu-
nity. 

As for Peterson, self-sufficien-
cy among both children and the 
agency is what she is striving for. 
Currently, a work-experience 
program for youths, operating 
as a sub-program of ·Youth for 
Progress, is under consideration. 

"If our kids can't work, they 
can't survive; if they can't survive, 
they're going to resort to all 
kinds of different activities," 
Peterson added. With the help of 
caring and concerned people like 
Peterson and Ramirez, the only 
foreseeable activity that these 
children will continue to engage 
in, is progress. 

Youth for Progress would 
deeply'appreciate help from any 
volunteers. They also have the 
ability to supervise and provide 
structure to any intern interested 
in counseling, psychology, socio-
logy, and juvenile justice. For 
information, contact Pam Peter-
son at (619) 236-1853 or Tony 
RIImirez at (6/9) 232-1093.

encouragement to aHend the program.

Lower spring break use 
averts water shortage crisis 

According to Himel, the fire 
department was told about the 
on-<:ampus water problems so 
that their first response units to 
an on-<:ampus fire would include 
tanker trucks which carry a water 
supply. 

The tall buldings at Muir have 
had continual low-pressure prob-
lems since the main broke, in 
part because of their height , said 
Danylyshyn-Adams. "We've been 
experiencing water shortages the 
past two months," she said, 
mentioning that the water in her 
II th floor Tioga apartment stops 
flowing every morning at 7 am. 
"We're probabl,.y carrying water 
to her," Himel said .

Recent Santa Ana conditions 
nearly led to a repetition of the 
water shortage that resulted in 
the closure ofthe UCSD campus 
on Jan. 19, according to city 
water officials. 

Since there were no students 
living on campus during the 
spring break Santa Ana, there 
was a reduction in UCSD's usual 
water consumption, averting a 
crisis. 

City officials also said that the 
broken main which caused the 
Jan. 19 incident was fixed on 
March 31. 

The January shortage led to 
the closing of campus for safety 
and health reasons, according to 
the UCSD administration. The 
shortage affected Third, Muir, 
and Revelle colleges, but not 
Warren which is on a different 
water-main system. 

Darly Grigsby, assistant depu-
ty director of the systems division 
of the San Diego Department, 
said, "You all probably had the 
most trouble during the Santa 
Anas." Grigsby stated that while 
the city's water supply is set up in 
a circular loop so that service can 
be provided even if a water line 
breaks, UCSD is at the end of 
the line for the main that supplied 
water on campus after the Jan. . 
19 main rupture. 

George Himel, associate vice 

chancellor for business affairs, 
confirmed Grigsby's statements . 
"We're at the end ofthe line , and 
if everybody uses water, we come 
up short. It has to do with the 
way water is routed to us around 
that break," Himel said . 

The water main that broke 
that has now been replaced is a 
51-inch pre-stressed concrete tube 
which serves U CSD and the north-
western part of the City of San 
Diego, according to Grigsby. 
Even though only one pipe seg-
ment broke, others nearby 
showed evidence of corrosion. 
Therefore the city is replacing 14 
segments of pipe each of which 
weighs 16 tons. Grigsby said the 
replacement pipe was delivered 
starting in early March, at the 
rate of one section a day. 

G.rigsby said the burst water 
main was returned to service on 
March 31. However, in an earlier 
interview he cautioned that the 
"original target date was mid-
April." Grigsby said one of the 
water department's main con-
struction crews had been at the 
site every day since the middle of 
February. "A 5 I-inch pipeline is 
a big pipeline to be without," 
Grigsby said. 

The break occurred in a canyon 
during a windy storm, but "our 
people don't think it was because 
of the storm." Grigsby siad. He 
added that mains often break 
when rain and changing tempera-
tures causes ground-shifts, but 

that water department personnel 
did not think that's what hap-
pened to this main . 

However, the water depart-
ment doesn't know why it broke. 
"A lot of times it's not easy to tell 
whya main broke," Grigsby said . 

According to Himel, he had 
advised UCSD residents not to 
usc water from 7 to 9 am in the 
morning and from 4 to 6 pm in 
the afternoon. "In the meantime 
[until the main was fixed] we 
have to conserve water," Himel 
said. 

If there were another campus 
water emergency, "I think that 
we would probably do it the 
same way," said Pat Danylyshyn-
Adams, the Muir resident dean, 

"The folks in the rforms arc 
being very good about it ," said 
Himel about on-<:ampus student 
reaction to the water problems. 
"What makes it more bearable 
for the students is that it's not a 
university problem," Danylyshyn-
Adams said . lID

Triton V-ball 
falls to VCI 
Loss of second setter Lee leads 
to 3-1 defeat 

By BRIAN ITOW 
G".,dMIt ",rUn 

The Triton men's volleyball 
team's roller coaster season took 
another dive Tuesday night as 
they were handed two more los-
ses. First, they lost setter John 
Lee to a possible season-ending 
ankle injury. Then they lost their 
match with 20th ranked UC 
Irvine, 15-7, 10-15, 15-3, 15-13. 

Early in the first game, Lee 
went up to block an Irvine spike 
attempt and came down on the 
leg of another Triton, turning his 
ankle . Since Lee was the only 
setter, coach Digger Graybill 
suited up; the team was forced to 
play without one. And, their 
passing game clearly suffered 
from the loss. Said Lee, "We 
started out okay but we didn't 
pass well and we weren't there 
emotionally ... 

Still, after giving the first game, 
the Tritons regrouped and were 
able to battle and scrap their way 
to a second game victory before 
their offensive disorganization 
forced errors that caused them to 

lose the final two games, and 
subsequently, the match, 3-1. 

With the injury to Lee, Gray-
bill must now face the prospects 
of a setter-less team as they ap-
proach the league tournament, 
only three games away. 

"We started the season with 
four setters and now we have 
none," Graybill said. 

At the beginning of the year, 
we lost Jeff Jamile who decided 
to pursue other interests and we 
red shirted freshman John Child-
ers. Then,just before spring break 
Marco Gentzbourger, our start-
ing setter pulled ligaments in his 
right ankle, leaving us with just 
one player at that· position. We 
decided to gamble by suiting up 
only one setter. But now with 
John (Lee) hurt, I guess we lost 
that gamble. 

"Without a setter, offensively, 
it puts us in a real predicament 
and you could see that tonight . 
As a result, it made it difficult for 
us to play together. We didn't 
pass well, we didn't block well 
and we let ourselves be affected

emotionally. Still, we battled and 
scrapped, even after we lost John. 
I was pleased to see the effort. 
Our goal is still the same: to win 
the league tournament. And, we 
can still do it." Graybill said. 

But, first, the Tritons must 

find another setter. GraybiJI said 
he was contemplating activating 
John Childers or recruiting on 
campus in order to find a replace-
ment for their injured setters. If 
they can do it, they may very well 
rebound from their latest dive 

and ride the roller coaster back 
to the top with a championship 
at the league tournament which 
takes place at UCSD on April 22 
and 23.

A S will astound while Twins topple 
By J. BERESFORD-HOWE 

The AL West is the kind of 
division a general manager looks 
at and says, " If I can get some 
washed up National Leaguer to 
DH who can hit 25 home runs, 
we might win because everyone 
else stinks ." 

It's the best balanced division; 
last place was only 12 games out 
last year. Consequently, predicl-

ing the division is a fool's errand. 
Hey, I qualify. 

Oakland - Everybody, includ-
ing the management, thinks the 
A's have improved themselves 
enormously through the acquisi-
tions of Dave Parker (see above) 
and Bob Welch . That's true, but 
the main improvement will be 
realized because they dumped 
some major league head cases 
like Mike Davis, J oaquin An-

dujar, Jose Rijo and Jay Howell. 
The A's have a murderer's row 

(albeit with no lead-off hitter) 
and the deepest starting five any-
where (Dave Stewart, Welch, 
Curt Young, Steve Ontiveros and 
Storm Davis). 

It should be noted that the A's 
are one of the last few teams with 
real bleachers . It's $3 to lie out in 
the sun and watch the A's march 
through the American League. 
And they have Henry's on tap. 

Seattle - Dick WiIliams is the 
best manager in baseball except 
Wh itey Herzog. With Mark 
Langston ready to win the Cy 
Young and Mike Moore expect-
ing a decent year , and with the 
power I speed offense Williams

quickly and viciously in the case 
of health problems Iikc drug ad-
diction. (George Steinbrenner is 
ineligible; his name has been 
permanently inscribed on the 
trophy and he's scheduled to be 
inducted to the Brown and Puck-
ery Hall of Fame this August.) 
Give it to Agyros, for cheapness 
and extortion. 

Kansas City - Kurt Stilwell is 
the Royals ' key. If Stilwell can 
hit like he did in Cincinnati and 
play a decent shortstop, the 
Royals will improve. If not, Bret 
Saberhagen and Charlie Leib-
randt, ground ball pitchers both, 
will probably strike to get Stil-
well out. 

some major gaps that Cookie 
Rojas will be at a loss to plug; 
Mark McLemore won't make it 
as a lead-off hitter, Jack Howell 
can't hit lefties and Chili Davis, 
for all the money their paying 
him, can't hit righties. 

Mike Witt will once again be 
the main reason to watch the 
Angels; he's as ovcrpoweringand 
interesting to see as Dwight 
Gooden. 

Texas - Ruben Sierra is the 
best young player in baseball.

Canseco. Forget Wally Joyner 
(please) and forget Will Clark 
and Cory Snyder and Kevin

the Kingdome, too.

George Brett needs to improve 
from the lame 25 home runs and

two years, and the Royals are

Manager John Wathan's four-
man rotation experiment will put 
Saberhagen on the DL in June 
and Wathan at the unemploy-
ment office in July. Bo Jackson 
will strike out 180 limes and 
retire in mid-September. 

California - Gene Mauch may 
not have the temperamcnt for 
closc races and close playoff 
games, but over the course of a 
season, he's a genius aljuggling a 
line-up to hide weaknesses. With-
out Mauch, the Angell will have

hit for power, hit for average, 
keep his on-base-percentage 
high, throw and is intensely 
competitive. 

Hough will survive the balk 
clampdown, and Bobby Witt is 
on the verge of beinl a real 
pitcher. What happened to Greg 
Harris, anyway? He can't even 
make the Cleveland staff now. 

Chicago - It has been widely 
noted that the Sox rotation won 
a total of not quite thirty games 
last year. The starters will sur-
prise, however. Jack McDowell 
will be Rookie of the Ycar, 
Rickey Horton will blossom in 
his new role and Jerry Ruess will

Tritons use balk, steal

The UCSD men's baseball 
team improved its record to 
18-6 on a balk and Triton 
Gary Fessia's successful steal 
of home in the top of eleventh 
inning to beat Biola Univer-
sity 8-7 in a nonconference 
game in La Mirada, Tuesday. 

Starter Mike Morgan went 
ten innings to improve his 
record t04-\. Rich Tomolonis 
came on in relief in the elev-
enth to earn the save. 

The Tritons struck quick 
and early in the top of the 
first, scoring first on a two-
run homerun by Jim Mar-
tinez, driving home Thad 
Ferre, who had singled and 
reached second on a balk. 

Biola made a run for the 
game in the fourth, sending 
nine batters to the plate, 
scoring four runs on four hits 
and two errors. Morgan and 
Tomolonis managed to keep

continued from pale 12 
whose team had just takcn an 
easy victory from the Tritons, 
felt they could do it . "The league 
tournament comes down to who-
ever is playing the best at the 
time. Any of the four teams in 
our league can win it. Tonight, 
UCSD's problems wcrc com-
pounded by the loss of its sctter. 
They are a much better team 
than they showed and are ca-
pable of taking a makeshift line-
up and turning it into a winning 
team. Come tournament time 
they have as good a chance of 
wining as anyone else," Ashen 
said. 

In the tournament, the Tritons 
(2-18, 19th in the nation) will be 
playing without three key per-
formers. Gentzbourger, Lee, and 
Bob Benefield, who was injured 
earlier in the scason. Graybill 
should have his team ready for a 
strong run at the title. lID

Foxlights ''BrightLights'' 
by eva WODg 

art. editor 

You read the book, "Bright Lights, Big City," a week ago. You didn't like it much 
because it was written in the second person, and since the nameless protagonist is a male, it 
was hard for you, a female, to see yourself as a "him." Also, when you read the book, you 
didn't relate to the way the protagonist lived his life. 

It is now just past 10 am, Monday, March 21. You are heading north on the 405 
towards Beverly Hills. You begin to wonder if you will make it to the preview screening of 
"Bright Lights, Big City" that is scheduled to begin in half an hour. You wonder if you will 
like the movie more than the book. While you liked the ending, you found the rest of the 
book depressing. You seriously hope you will like the movie more than the book . 

You are also a little bit nervous because you are drawing a blank on questions to ask Jay 
Mcinerney, who wrote both the book and the movie's screenplay. A question that is 
gnawing at you is whether or not Michael J. Fox can transcend his usual role as a perennial 
high school student. 

Can Fox portray a believable Jamie Conway (the name the protagonist is given in the 
movie version of "Bright Lights, Big City"), a man who is addicted to cocaine and on the 
edge of destruction due to living his life in the fast lane? 

It is surprising how closely this movie follows the book, since movie adaptations 
usually prostitute what is presented in novels. During the press conference McInerney 
stated that "Bright Lights, Big City" went through 17 different screenplays (not all written 
by McInerney). The reason that the movie resembles the book is that the original 
screenplay, which Mcinerney wrote, was finally the version decided upon. 

In one of the other screenplays which wasn't written by Mcinerney, Fox's character was 
to be a chocoholic rather than addicted to cocaine. Mcinerney stated, "it was chocolate 
down to the last week" before snoqting since there was no script the first week "Bright 
Lights, Big City" was in production. 

Mcinerney stated that one of the reasons he was fired from writing the screenplay three 
and a half years ago was due to the heavy usage of cocaine in the storyline, which he saw as 
an important element of the movie. He stated, "Cocaine was a metaphor implying false · 
values . . . it is a mindless consumer good, which is only perceived to have value." 

Though the movie adapt ion resembles the book, the movie leads to a better 
appreciation of the book. It is kind of ironic, but it is Fox's believable portrayal of the 
unhappy Jamie that makes " Bright Lights, Big City" work. 

Fox's portrayal of Jamie , a man who has yet to come to terms with his wife (Phoebe 
Cates) leaving him and the death of his mother, (Diane Wiest), shows how someone could 
easily fall prey to living a certain type of lifestyle as a way to escape from misfortunes of 
one's past. Almost anyone could be lured into the "bright lights" of living in the fast lane 
of a "big city." 

Through Fox, the viewer can relate to the way Jamie lives his life. In watching Fox's 
actions, Jamie's anguish is felt. He mechanically works as a fact checker at an established 
New York magazine, while his real goal is to be a fiction writer. There are quite a few tense 
scenes which take place between Jamie and higher ups. 

His best friend, Tad Allagash (Kiefer Sutherland), believes the swinging night life is the 
cure for Jamie's unhappiness. The lifestyle Tad has introduced Jamie into is filled with 
women, drinking and drugs. After losing his job, due to the fast lifestyle he has become 
accustomed to, Jamie realizes that living his life in this way leads to more anguish than 
relief from the pain he is already feeling. See BIG CITY, pale I

Prudence Carlson, a former 
contributing editor at Art in 
America and currently a New 
York-based free-lance writer 
and art critic, will lecture at 
the La Jolla Museum of Con-
temporary Art's Cost Room 
on Tuesday, April 12 at 7:30 
pm. Her topic is "The 'Post 
Modern' Chimera, The 
Weight of History, and a New 
Symbolism." Carlson is the 
author of catalogue essays on 
John Mclaughlin and Sigmar 
Polke and her writings have 
also appeared in Artforum. 
Admission is free to museum

" Graceland Tour," Miriam 
Makeka, "The Empress of 
African Song," will appear 

with special guest Hugh 
Masekela in concert on Tues-

To the world, Makeba is a 
symbol of the struggle of her 
people: the oppressed of South 
Africa. Maeskela is a South 
African-born trumpeter and 
vocalist. His recent Warner

Discounting AIt'f 
by eabrina youman. 

hiatu. writer 

It is a given that students are 
broke. It is also given that stu-
dents need to be entertained. 
This is because affordable 
entertainment reduces the 
stress induced by the highly 
structured and demanding 
routine of the quarter system, 
with its constant flux of mid-
terms and finals. The San 
Diego Theatre League is 
attempting to alleviate both 
problems through the ARTS 
TlX box office, which offers 
half-price tickets the day of 
the event. The discount tickets 
offer starving students a rare 
night out on the town. 

The ARTS TIX booth also 
doubles as a TicketMaster 
location with full-price 
advance sale tickets to all 
TicketMaster events. The 
booth has been operating since 
June 1986 in the lobby of the 
Spreckles Theatre, which is 
located downtown on Broad-
way, between Firstand Second 
Avenues. The San Diego 
Theatre League is increasing 
its efforts to make the per-
forming arts accessible by re-
locating the Times ARTS TlX 
Ticket Center to Horton Plaza. 
The new site will be on the 
ground level of the Broadway 

Circle, near the main entrance 
to Robinson's department 
store. 

The new Horton Plaza loca-
tion will increase public 
awareness of the theatre 
industry by making tickets and 
information more obtainable. 
The Times ARTS TIX Ticket 
Center is expected to become 
a major beacon for the arts 
downtown by offering affor-
dable tickets. 

To date, ARTS TIX has 
sold over 33,000 tickets for 
over 70 performing arts and 
entertainment groups in San 
Diego and Los Angeles. The 
new discount ticket location 
will increase these numbers at 
a minimum cost to the San 
Diego League of Theatres. The 
overall buildling cost of the 
new center is over $96,000 
and will be covered by a 
$25,000 challenge grant from 
the Centre City Development 
Corporation and a $75,000 
donation from the Los Angeles 
Times. The site for the booth 
was donated by the Hahn 
Company, the developer of 
Horton Plaza, and many other 
major retail centers. 

Until the projected opening 
of the Horton Plaza location in 
July 1988, the tickets will be 
available Tuesday through

~~============================================================~r.~.~I~to~r~~ 
Stand and Deliver stands strong pie, facing different pressures. When the film reaches the 

climax, the viewer has the same 
butterflies as the characters 
taking the test. by robert leone 

hiatw writer 

What kind of film gets 
funded by ARCO, the Na-
tional Science Foundation, the 
Ford Foundation, and the 
Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting? 

No, it's not an instructional 
film about atomic structure or 
a documentary about giant 
sqUid. It's "Stand and 
Deliver," and extremely un-
hyped docu-drama about a 
high school math teacher who 
took an L.A. barrio high 
school class from knowing 
how to make "exact change," 

to the Advanced Placement 
Calculus test. 

It's tough to write a dra-
matic screenplay in which the 
climax is taking a test, but wri-
ters Ramon Menendez and 
Tom Musca (also director and 
producer respectively) have 
done a competent job of 
molding the true story of Jaime 
Escalante and his calculus class 
into a filmable script. 

The actors are also effective 
in their roles. Edward James 
Olmos, who portrays Lt. Cas-
tillo on "Miami Vice," is bril-
liant as Escalante, a man who 
took a job teaching computers 
to high school students only 

Edward James Olmol and Lou Phillips appear in "Scand and Deli...er." 

to find out the school didn 't 
have any computers. 

Edward James Olmos. 

Olmos' acting is charming 
and believable, as is his prepa-
ration for the role, which 
included a weight gain and 
excluded the toupee he wears 
on "Miami Vice." 

Also believable is Lou 
Diamond Phillips, who por-
trayed Richie Valens in "La 
Bamba." His characterization 
of gang member and calculus 
student Angel Guzman is 
complex and stirring. His act-
ing, along with the script, goes 
beyond the usual cliches. 

The brilliance of this movie 
is not that it l>0rtrays high 
school, or a teacher, or a class. 

The good point of "Stand and 
Deliver," the thing that makes 
it different, is that it's a movie 
about people; different peo-

" Stand and Deliver" is a 
competent and interesting film 
which should be seen.

NOSTALGHIA 
Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky 
121 min. Russian/ltalian 1984 

Nostalghia was the late Andrei Tarkovsky's first film after 
his exile from Russia, and deals with what he called "an 

agonizing longing for an inner home." It is a visually 
stunning, thinly veiled fiction about a mystical Soviet 

exile tom by an unrequitable passion for his 
abandoned homeland.

At the southwest corner of 
Columbia and Cedar there's a 
beige building with red trim 
and red doors. As soon as you 
clear the threshold you're 
confronted by the gleaming 
grill of a Seagrave Heavy 
Pumper, a crimson, chrome, 
and brass veteran of the San 
Diego Fire Department. 

In fact, you have to be care-

ful where you walle, for the 
Firehouse Museum is 
crammed with memorabilia 
celebrating the conflict 
between civilization and 
combustion. 

Firefighters throughout his-
tory have captured our imagi-
nation, stirred our souls and 
saved our lives. 

There are all sorts of items 
at the Firehouse Museum.

their insurance company for 
the benefit of insurance-
company-hired fire crews. The 
oldest firemark is from 1714. 
There are display cases full of 
uniform patches, badges, 
helmets, trumpets, hose noz-
zles, and iron foundry molds 
for fire hydrants mounted on 
the walls. 

There are three original 
Currier and lves lithographs 
depicting firefighting. Also 
there are fire alarms, fire 
extinguishers, and the list goes 
on. 

As far as history goes, the 
museum in large part concen-
trates on the San Diego Fire 
Department. Among the pho-
tos chronicling the S.D.F.D. '5 
history are the 1917 gag pic-
ture of" Aerial Truck No. 1," 
and a large 1927 soft focus 
portraitoffour blacle S.D.F.D. 
members. There also are 
printed cards with the history 
of the department mounted 
on the walls, and a number of 
former S.D.F.D. engines. 

And there are curiosities, 
including the hand-hauled fire 
engine that was La Jolla's only 
fire protection from 1905 to 
1913, an engine that was retired 
"during the Civil War era," 
and a fire engine built in a 
Model T chassis. 

The building's P.A. system 
constantly broadcasts the 
emotionless voices of the fire 
department's dispatchers. 

The museum building used 
to be the base for Engine 
Company 6 and the location 
of the S.D.F.D. machine shops, 
where among other things the 
S.D.F.D. built their own hose 
nozzles . The city still owns the 
building, but lets the museum 
use the space. 

The museum is operated by 
the San Diego Hoole and 
Ladder Company, which 
organized the museum in 1962. 
It's staff is entirely volunteer 
(most of them are retired fire-
fighters). Entrance is free, but 
a $1 donation is suggested. 
The museum is open from 10 
am to 4 pm on Saturdays and 
Sundays only . It's phone 
number is 232-FIRE.

Art and reason 
When Ma rk and I decided to spend 

the weekend at his mother 's hOllse, 
I never imagined I would be walking 
into a mOll e' nightmare. There were 
cat everywhere. 

Cat plaques, cat statues, cat clocks, 
cven a cat mat. I couldn't begin to dupli-
cate her collection of kitty litter if! spent 
a year at a garage sa le. Conspicuously 
ab ent, however, was a real cat . Strange, 

I tho ught, and began to tear that a 
weekend with cat woman could be a 
lot less than purr-fect. 
But then he came home, and 
Mark introduced her. She wa 
dre ed surprisingly well-no 
leopard pants. In fact, you 
could say she was the cat's meow, 
but Hi rather not. 

She offered me a cup of Dutch Choc-
olate Mint. Now that wa omething 
I c u Id relate to. Then she brought it 
our in the mo t beautiful, di tinctly 

unfeline china Hi ever een. As we 
ipped, I found outthat Mrs. Ca mpbell 

ha my ame weakne '" for chocolate, 
loves the theater a much as I do, but, 
incredihly ncver saw "Cats." So Mark 
and I arc taking her next month.

Big City 
Continued from page 1 

After losing his job, he be~ 
gins to face the reasons for the 
problems that are destroying 
his life . While having dinner 
with his ex~coworker, Megan 
(Swoosie Kurtz), he gets drunk 
and tells her how he met his 
wife, and how she one day 
decided to stay in Paris. 

In his drunken state he 
makes an unsuccessful pass at 
Megan, becomes embarassed 
and leaves. Going back to his 
apartment he finds his brother, 
Michael (Charlie Schlatter) 

Kiefer Sutherland and 
Michael]. Fox 

waiting for him. Jamie had 
been avoiding his brother 
because he didn't want to deal 
with the anniversary of their 
mother's death. 

To cope with this reminder 
he snorts some "Bolivian 
marching powder," and thinks 
back to the last moments he 
spent with his mother. This 
poignant scene between Wiest 
and Fox shows the strong rela~ 
tionship Jamie had with his 
mother. 

Jamie realizes he has hit rock 
bottom at a party when he sees 
Amanda with her new fiance. 
At the party, he calls Vicky 
(Tracy Pollan), Tad's whole~ 
some cOllRin. tlnd begins to 
come to grips with his prob~ 
lems, as he informs her of his 
mother's death. 

The role of Vicky is small, 
as are the roles of most of the 
characters in "Bright Lights, 

Jason Robards appears in "Bright 
Lights , Big City." 

Big City," but Vicky's caring 
nature can be seen in the few 
scenes she appears. Unfortu~ 
nately, with Pollan cast as Fox's 
love interest, it is easy to think 
of the fresh out of high school 
Alex and Ellen seen on "Fam~ 
ily Ties." 

The ending of the movie, as 
the book's, is powerful in that 
Jamie steps out of the pseudo~ 
"bright IIghtlS" "f the night 
into the light of the awakening 
dawn.
