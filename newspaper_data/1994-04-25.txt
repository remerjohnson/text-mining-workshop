In Tense Forum 
EMPOWa&lENI': AASU 
sponsored event draws both 
support and criticism from audience 
By c....nc. McF ..... nd 
Staff Writer 

Members of the Nation of Islam (NOI), a 
black Muslim organization which has gained 
notoriety for anti-Semitic statements by several 
of its members, spoke on campus during a forum 
hosted by the African-American Student Union 
(AASU) last Friday to address the defacement of 
the Che Cafe mural and issues of black empow-
erment. 

Minister Rabin Muhammad, the San Diego 
representative of the NOI, delivered an hour-
long speech to a crowd of over ISO people, 
followed by a question-and-answer session. 

Several UCSD police officers were on hand, 
as were security guards from the NOI who frisked 

forum auendants to confiscate cameras, tape 
recorders and weapons. 

"The biggest problems in America today are 
nationalism, materialism, sexism and most im-
portant, racism," Muhammad said. "Why should 
we be fighting for civil right! in 19941 

"If all people can live in peace under a big 
melting pot, then America has to prove it," 
Muhammad said. "We need our own universi-
ties, our own neighborhoods." 

During the forum, while some audience mem-
bers applauded Muhammad's calls for black 
empowerment and education, others audibly 
voiced disagreement. . 

However, when Muhammad commented that 
the audience possibly expected him to begin 
name-calling and preaching racism, he was in-
terrupted a non-affiliate shouting, "If you were 
honest you would." Muhammad replied that he 
would do his best to be honest.

A.S. 
Presidential 
Election 
Invalidated 

By E .. lne C.muao 
Associate News Editor 

Ruling that the posting of fliers en-
dorsing President-elect Poncho 
Guevara had a "substantial effect" on 
the recent A.S. election results, the A.S. 
Judicial Board is calling for an invali-
dation of the 1994 ASUCSD presiden-
tial elections and requiring new elec-
tions to be held before sixth week. 

In a hearing last Thursday, the board 
found Guevara guilty of three out of 
five charges of election bylaw viola-
tions brought against the candidate by 
Financial Controller Tuesday Hancock. 

The board's decision reads, "It is the 
judgment of the Judicial Board that the 
violations in question and the flier in 
question had a substantial impact upon 
the results of the 1994 AS UCSD presi-
dential election." 

"I am appalled [at the decision] but 
I'm not surprised," Guevara said, add-
ing it shows the "entrenched bureau-
cracy" of the A.S. 

Guevara, an ex-chair of the Student 
Affirmative Action Committee 
(SAAC), said he felt the board found 
him guilty by association. 

"There was not even a shred of proof 
that I had produced these fliers or given 
anyone the approval to do so, but ap-
parently the board looked beyond this," 
Guevara said. 

Former Vice President Administra-
tive Randolph Siwabessy, the official 
spokesman for Hancock 's case, said he 
was impressed by the Judicial Board 's 
handling of the case. 

"I felt that the hearing was extremely 
fair," Siwabessy said, "but it was obvi-
ous by the end that the results of the 
election were affected by the posting of 
the fliers."

DETONATE: San Diego based oganization receives 
$40,000 grant for the removal of deadly explosives 
By Judy Wleclerhom 
Associate News Editor 

The United States Institute

dents $40,000 to produce a 
how-to guide of land mine

sources.

resolution and implementing a

In addition, the guide will 
include instructions on orga-

ance and managing ethical and

According to 
Robert

noted UCSD

The grant is to 
be used to help fund 
Terra Segura Inter-
national, a San Di-
ego-based non-

founded in 1991. 
According to Scott

UCSD graduate 
student involved in 
the corporation, 
" The long-time 
goal of Terra

project, explained that the 
$40,000 will cover the expenses 
needed for the first phase of the 
project, which includes travel 
to several countries to study 
current mine cleaning tech-
niques in different parts of the 
world. 

Research will be conducted on 
current techniques to establish the 
best method of eliminating land 
mines. According to Morgenstern, 
several graduate students will 
"make a trip to El Salvador and 
Nicaragua to study mine clear-
ance under the auspices of the 
Organization of the American 
States (OAS)." The OAS is an 
international organization com-
prised of the United States and 
Latin American countries that 
works to improve human rights in 
the Americas. 

The subsequent phases of the 
project will require additional 
grants to complete the compre-
hensive guide. "The book is in-
tended to give a reader from the 
Third World all the information 
needed for analyzing the mine 
problem, deciding what resources 
are needed from inside and out-

Neurosciences 

estimates each mine costs as 
little as $3 to purchase but can 
cost as much as $1,000 to re-
move. Terra Segura asserts that 
"existing land mines must be 
removed from the ground, be-
fore they kill or maim millions 
instead of hundreds of thou-
sands." 

Since the equipment currently 
used by the army to remove land 
mines is not financially feasible 
for the majority of poor countries, 
Terra Segura's goal is to find 
cheaper and more efficient meth-
ods to clear land mines and will 
document this research in the guide 
it will produce. 

Wolf was recently awarded a 
patent for an inexpensive, remotely 
operated mine-destruction ma-
chine designed for use in poor 
countries such as Mghanistan, 
Cambodia and Somalia. . 

Though Terra Segura Inter-
national continues to complete 
its guide to land mine clear-
ance. the organization also pro-
motes the idea that, "an impor-
tant part ~f the baltle must also 
be to prevent their further dis-
semination. "

Following his oration, 
Muhammad fielded questions 
from the audience. 

When asked by a student how 
he can promote racial unity while 
making racist remarks, 
Muhammad replied, "Tojudgethe 
NOI by the portrayal of the media 
is wrong." 

Muir College sophomore and 
Union of Jewish Studerit (UJS) 
member Asher Adelman asked 
Muhammad whether he sees anti-
Semitism as a problem. 

Muhammad responded, "Anti-
Semitism is a big problem of soci-
ety today, but it is really a Euro-
pean problem. Anti-Semite means 
half black, half white. We are not 
anti-Jewish, we are pro-Jew. We 
are anti-oppression. 

"The Jews need sympathy so 
they bomb their own synagogues," 
Muhammad added.

President Anthereca Edmerson 
said she was pleased with its out·

rum was very positive. We got a

think it was positive that we had

Edmerson.

GUARDIAN INTERVIEWS: CHALMERS JOHNSON AND PETER GoUREVITCH, DEAN OF IRIPS 

THE ALLEGATIONS LEVELED AGAINST IRiPS BY 
CHALMERS JOHNSON RAISE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS 
ABOUT THE FUTURE OF POLITICAL SCIENCE 

• 

HALMERS JOHNSON'S DEPARTURE 
from The Graduate School of 
International Relations and Pacific 
Studies (IR/PS) In 

March sent a shock wave across UCSD. 
Clearly the most renowned professor at the 
school,johnson's harsh critique of the Japanese 
program pushed the quiet, often Invisible 
graduate school Into the spotlight - an honor 
that the dean of the school. Peter Gourevltch, 
could have certainly lived without. 

johnson's allegations of "academic Incest," 
a charge he wryly uses to describe an alleged 
'01 boy network of IRlPS faculty which Is 
pushing the school toward orthodoxy, and 
"academic malpractice" - the damage It 
inflicts on students - cannot be taken lightly. 
He raises a number of critical issues not only 
for IRIPS and the study of politics. but also 
for the real world beyond the ivory tower. 

Gourevltch flatly denies Johnson's charges. 
reaffirming the school's mission to provide 
students with a diverse education. The market 
place of ideas. says Gourevltch. Is free and 
open. 

While Gourevltch seems to overstate 
the dlvmity of opinion at IRlPS, Johnson Is 
certainly not frll from hyperboll. 
Nonetheless.Johnson Identifies an Important 
trend In poIldeal SCience. which may very 
we/I be taking our "priestly" academics lven 
further from studying the real world. And u 
hi and other point out, this can havi dire 
effects in an Increulncly complex world.

then they made an appointment that 
added up to a violation of almost 
every staodIrd we lmow of, that is, the 
appointment ofMicbael1bies. Many 
universities prohibit the hiring of 
people from the same university. 1f 
you are going to hire somebody from 
the same university, partirularly some-
body without a Ph.D. and without any 
kind of publications record, you would 
have to make an extremely strong 
case. Basically, you have to say that 
you could not go to any other school 
and find somebody with equal or bet-
ter qualifications. With Thies, that's 
just not the case. It's also clearly a 
violationofaffirmative action require-
ments, not looking around for women 
or minorities or anybody else. 

So the students protested. I think 
you've seen the letters that the students 
wrote to the dean, and they were stone-
walled. We had virtually 100 percent 
of the students in Japanese studies 
protesting that they were not consulted 
and that it looked like the degree was 
being watered down. There was no 
way to kid yourself that this was a 
distinguished, or as the dean loves to 
say, "cutting edge," appointment. Un-
der these circumstances, I decided to 
weigh in on the side of the students.

of Latin America. So Michael Thies is

am not willing to have it discussed by 
people who don't know what it's all 
about and who basically go quiet and 
let it ta1ce over. 

These criticisms are also echoed 
by the students, who have complained 
bitterly. The over-arching course (I 
have said in the past, "only required 
course" and several people have pr0-
tested). clearly the single most impor-
tanl oowse required of everybody in 
the graduate school in the first year, is 
two quarters of policy-making pr0-
cesses (PMP). I have objected be-
cause this course bas never been re-
viewed by the faadty at IRIPS and is 
taught by a political science professor 
who is a specialist on the U.S. Con-
gress, namely Mat McCubbins. The 
reason he bas taught this course is that 
he is a pal of the political scientists 
who run IRIPS, and the students have 
complained about this.

Yes. It WIS a surprise to discover 
that these CIClmpirac:ies to commit 'aca-
demic inoest' exist in other fields, 
namely, national security Iftd Latin 
American studies. Professorsbavealso 
been carrying on a little quiet beef 
with the university, with the incursion 
of rational choice. What emerges is a 
pattern of, essentially, lazy deans al-
lowing the faculty with vested inter-
ests to promote their partirular point 
of view and hive veto power over 
appointments. This is then relf6rmed 
by the deIns, who are suppoaed to do 
quality control, and by the chancellor, 
who is CSIIentially asleep and merely

Continued from .... 1 

At the bearing, Judicial Board 
Cbair Rick Moncbo stepped down 
because of I conflict of interest 
and delegated his position to 
Revelle representative Larry 
HilmlD. After three bours of de-
liberation, tbe bOlrd found 
GueV1r1 guilty of fliling to 
promptly cllim Diera posted by 
SAAC which endorsed him. 

"I feel it was I very flir ruling. "

much worse. Poncho could hive 
been removed from the elections." 

Guevuacontendshe abould not 
be beld responsible for the fliers 
becauae they were mlde IDd posted 
without bis knowledge. 

"The fliers were not made up 
by myaelf or a member of my 
slate, nor did the slale delepte 
authority to the perlOn who pr0-
duced them." Guevua slid. "We 
bad no knowledge oftbeir produc-
tion or diltribution." 

At the trial, Guevarl presented 
a leiter from SAAC Vice Cblir 
NIdina PoweU in wbich she said 
she produced IDd paid for the f1i-
era herself. 

"'The candidates, oor lDy of the

Guevlrl and bis sllte bid 
agreed to c1lim financial respon· 
sibility for the fliers in an informal 
bearing on the lISt day of the elec-
tion in order to avoid I selling of 
the ballots. However, Siwabessy 
. argued thlt since the fiie ... were

riod and were nol claimed until

DAnNa: Results of a survey about dating attitudes 
given to 300 UCSD students indicate that most 
students are dissatisfied with the dating scene here 
at UCSD 

OR MANY STU-
dents, college is 
an opportunity to 
expand their ho· 
rizons. It is about 

experiencing new freedoms, ex-
ploring new subjects and meeting 
new people. And for many, the 
ideal college experience includes 
dating. However, the actual col· 
lege dating scene may not meet 
expectations. 

For example, Alison, a Revelle 
senior, said, "I expected to meet a 
lot of guys to date and befriend, 
and I was totally disappointed. The 
only way to meet people is through 
friends, and there's an impersonal 
feeling on campus which makes 
access to guys even harder." 

A sample of 300 UCSD stu-
dents living on campus were sur-
veyed about their dating habits at 
the end Qf Fall Qu'arter 1993. Most 
of the respondents were fmt- or 
second-year students living in 
campusdonnsoraputments.The 
survey results and a collection of 
student interviews provide insight 
into the world of dating at UCSD. 
ellt •• ort .. of .,..1-. 

The three most common cat-
egories of dating cited by students 
in the survey are "scamming," ca-
sual dating and exclusive dating. 
Each dating type differs in its level 
of intimacy and the context in 
which it takes place. 

said, "It must be pre-planned, not 
spontaneous." Of the students sur-
veyed, 19.8 percent placed them-
selves in the "mostly casual dat-
ing" category. 

Exclusive dating, or a monoga-
mous relationship, was the most 
popular dating pattem among the 
students surveyed. Interviewees 
widely agreed commitment to one 
partner is based on a mixture of 
availability of time, sexual attrac-
tion and emotional attachment. 
Over half of the students surveyed 
wanted to date eXClusively at some 
point during their college years, 
and 75 percent of them had dated 
exclusively in the past. A Revelle 
sophomore typified the attitude 
about exclusive dating, saying, 
"I've always wanted the stability 
and security of a relationship." 
AJthough the majority of students 
wanted to date exclusively, only 
23 percent of those surveyed la-
beled themselves "mostly exclu-
sive" daters. 

Exclusive daters indicated that 
they met their partners largely 
through friends and/or casual dat-
ing. Many students said they would 
neverseriously date a person with 
whom they had scammed.

Respondents were next asked 
about other aspects of their lives 
which affected their dating pat-
terns, such as gender, religion and 
age.

According to the results of the 
survey, males and females scam, 
casually date and exclusively date 
at about the same relative rate. In 
tenns of dating preference, the re-
sults diverged acroas gender lines. 

Students were asked, "Ideally, 
which type of dating would you 
like to be doing in your college 
years?" Eleven percent of the 
males surveyed chose scamming 
as their ideal, while none of the 
females indicated a preference for 

The UCSD Guardiaa 

and 

scamming. 
"I guesa we scam bccauae col-

lep is new and we're goinl crazy 
with it. It's kind of a limbo," Slid 
a firat-year male from Muir Col-
lege. 

Most females (34 percent) se-
lected casual dating as the ideal, as 
opposed to 2S percent of male 
respondents. 

"I want a relationship, but I'm 
leaving my options open. I don't

want to be tied down. I'm not 
taking anything seriously, so I'm a 
casual dater," said one female 
Marshall College junior. 

Equal percentagcaofmales aad 
females said they wanted to exclu-
sively date in college. Cameron, a 
first-year student at Ftftb College, 
described bis ideal relationship as 
exclusive. 

"My ideal is one girl, 1M airl. 
Someone I can have a combina-
tion of sexuality and friendship 

Most students described 
"scamming" as a temporary, purely 
sexual interaction, usually occur-
ring under the influence of alco-
hol. Ellen, a Muir College sopho-
more, described scamming as 
"physical ... self-indulgent, unlike 
serious dating where you care 
about the other [person]." Jason, 
also a Muir sophomore, said that a 
"typical scammer" would be found 
"picking up on women, dancing, 
buying them drinks ... and the en-
tire interaction is done solely for 
sexual fulfillment." Only five per-
cent of the 300 students surveyed 
characterized their dating patterns 
as "mostly scamming." HE SAID, SHE SAID ...

Gender allO played a role in 
dating expectations. While the 
responsibility of asking some-
one out on a date traditionally 
belongs to the male, the survey 
indicated that both sexes make 
the first move. Although many 
of the females surveyed men-
tioned they would like males to 
initiate dates, 60 percent of them 
had asked someone out at least 
once, compared to 90 percent of 
male respondents. 
....... 

One might aasume that students 
who belong to religions such as 
Catholicism, which preaches ab-
stention from sex before marriage, 
would be less likely to scam or 
casually date. 

However, survey resulls indi-
cate that Catholic students are 
the moat likely to scam and casu-
ally date, followed by Protes-
tants and Jews. Those students 
who identified tbemlClves as 

atbeists were the leut likcly to 
participate in any type of dating 
activity. 

Besides identifying their reli-
gious affiliation, students were 
asked to rate how religious they 
are, based on a scale of 1 to 5. In 
general, students in the survey who 
identified themselves as "very reo 
Iigious" were more likcly to date. 

One reason for this could be 
that students who are active within 
religious communities may have 
more opportunity to meet one an· 
other at religious services or on-
campus organizations. For ex-
ample,Jane, a Muirjunior involved 
in the Intervaraity Christian Fel-
lowship (IVCF), said Christianity 
is a common factor which brings 
many couples in the group to-

.gether. 
"I see a lot of dating [within 

IVCF), probably because every-
one has similar religious convic· 
tions. In fact, they encourage dat-
ing within the group 10 that you 
date a CbriItian, " she said. 
Y .... C ••••• 

Casual datios. although char-
acterized as non-comminal and 
sometimes temporary by those 
surveyed, is a more fonnalized 
type of dating, emphasizing less 
of a sexual motive than scamming. 
Most participants in the survey 
agreed on a certain set of "casual 
date" characteristics. First, there 
must be a certain intention in-
volved, such as getting to know 
someone or having fun. Deeper 
emotions are usually involved, and 
the date location must be off -cam-
pus to be formal (as in the com-
mon phrase, "We're going' out'"). 
Finally, there is a set schedule to · 
the date or, as one interviewee 

UCSD Students were asked about their thoughts on dating. Here Is 8 compertson of what males 
and females considered to be their Ideal datfng scenarios:

The frequency of dating re-
ported by upperclassmen largely 
corresponded with the category 
they selected. Sophomores,jun-
iors and seniors who said their 
dating activities lie in the 
"mostly scamming" category 
averaged 6.5 scams in their col-
lege years. 

Likewise, "casual daters" av-
erag~ 4.6 casual dates since they 
came to college. "Mostly exclu-
sive" daters averaged 3.1 rela-
tionships during their years at 
college, and "non-daters" avcr-
aged one date since they came to

Most students reported that 
thcy are disappointed with their 
dating experiences at UCSD. 
When asked to comment on thc 
campus dating scene, only five 
percent of the students surveyed 
reported that they were satisfied. 
Comments like "Nobody dates 
here," "It's difficult to meet 
people" and "There's nobody I 
want to date," were common re-
sponses. 

Although 91 percent of those 
surveyed said they want to date, 
only 50 percent said they were 
actively dating. 

Why do UCSD students say 
they arc unhappy with the dat-
ing scene hcre? The reasons for 
disappointmcnt with college dst-
ing stem from a variety of fac-
tors, ranging from cbanging at-
titudes about casual dating in 
the '90s to the overall campus 
atmosphere.

ADMISSIONS: 
()ornplanntsetUed 
after two-year debate 
ContInued from ..... 1 
filed a complaint with the Office 
of Civil Rights in the fall of 1991. 
That October, the univenity reo 
ceived received a letter notifying 
it that a complaint had been filed, 
claiming that the admissions policy 
discriminated against Asian ap-
plicants. 

Bowker said he was stunned 
when he received the complaint 
because he had never talked to 
Rohrabacher and "neither did any· 
one else on campus, as far as I 
know." According to Bowker, sev-
eral administraton at the time had 
hinted that Congressman 
Rohrabacher's large Asian-Ameri-
can constituency may have been 
behind the complaint. 

Three members from the San 
Francisco Office of Civil Rights 
reviewed sample applicant files 
from fall of 1989-91 and deliber-
ated for nearly two years before 
the Department of Education ren-
dered its decision. 

Since 1986, UCSD's admis-
sions policy has worked on a point 
system that was drafted in ~r­
dance with the UC Regents' ad-
missions requirements, The top 
60 percent of applicants are ad-
mitted solely by an academic in. 
dex that considers factors such as 
grade point average, standardized 
test scores, honors courses and 
courses completed beyond the 
minimum UC requirement. 

The remaining applicants are 
re-ranked and receive bonus points 
based on underrepresented ethnic 
identity, low family income, physi-
caJ disabilities and other facton. 
"We are looking for a diverse stu-
dent body," said Bowker. The bo-
nus points are added to the 
applicant's academic index, and 
the top 40 percent of the second 
index is accepted. 

The admissions policy clearly 
states that of the 10,000 total pos-
sible points considered in a 
student's admission, only 2,000 
points can possibly be generated if 
all special circumstances are met. 
A maximum of 300 points can be 
awarded according to ethnic crite-
ria. 

Fifty-one percent ofUCSD's stu-
dent body is white, 21 percent is 
Asian, 8.S percent is Chicano or 
Latino and 2.S percent is African 
American.

important things to worry about, 
like whether or not tonight is 25-

Another thing that bugs me is all 
these stupid niclmames. Sure, Fred 
"Heroin Junkie" Highway or Norm 
"The South Philly Crack Addict" 
Callahan are amusina at first, but 
their appeal wanes rather quickly. 

Finally, there is just too much 
pain involved in sports. I mean, you 
can get seriously hurt playing some 
of these games, especially the ones 
they play without all of that pad-
ding. I think I'll just stay right here 
and write about them instead, even 
though I almost broke a nail on a 
particularly ornery keyboard the 
other day.

Smoking Tritons Win Four Straight 
IOFI'IALL: UCSD has won six of i~ last eight games; playoffs still within reach 
By D8n KnIft 
Associate S~ Editor 

Although the UCSD softball 
team (t 7-18) may not make the play-
offs this year, it will certainly not be 
for a lack of effort. The Tritons have 
tom through their lale-1CUOIl sc:bed-
ule, winning six of their last eight 
contests in a last-ditch run at the 
poataeuon. 

On Saturday afternoon, UCSD 
played host to cross-town rival USD, 
sweeping both games of tbe double-
header to extend its current winning 
streak to four games. 

The Tritons found themselves 
trailing 6-1 in the fifth before they 
came to life offensively. UCSD tal-
lied four runs in each ofthe next two 
innings to grab a 9-6 advantage. 

Coach Patricia Gen:kens laid. 
Starting pitcher Usa Gil, who 

struggIed early on in the contest, 
came on strona in the later innings. 
In the sixth. Gil single-handedly 
smothered a two-on-nobody-out 
rally by striking out back-to-bacIt 
Torero batters and then snaring a 
bouncer toward the mound and gun-
ning the runner out at first. 

Gil was just as solid in the sev-
enth, retiring the USD bauers in 
order to clinch the win, 9-6. 

Game two was much more solid 
defensively for UCSD,wbic:h eameci 
a 5-4 win behind the weU-rounded 
performance of the starting pitcher, 
Shannon Mounger, and a number of 
terrific plays in the field. 

Scbueler drove a high-fly _ball to 
right. It was deep enough to bring in 
a runner from third and make tbe 
score 4-2. KeUi Connolly smacked 
a single that rounded out UCSD's 
scoring and gave it a three-run lead . 

The Tritons got a scare in the 
seventh when the Toreros narrowed 
the gap to 5-4 with one out and 
runners on the comen. However, 
Gil saved tbe day once again by 
stabbina a grounder, tagging out 
one runner herself, and throwing to 
first to end the game. 

On Thursday, UCSD battled Pt.

pitch gave UCSD a 3-2 lead, Kristin

Dominguez Hills ,nd Point 
Loma at Torrey Pines on Fri-
day. 

The Tritons tallied a 297, 
their best score at Torrey Pines 
since last year's NCAA Na-
tional Championship Tourna-
ment Point Loma was second, 
21 strokes back at 318, witb 
Dominguez Hills and River-
side finishing at 323 and 349, 
respectively. G~If Dale Abraham led the way 
for UCSD by notching an even-

par 72, while freshman Mike Hartford went out and 
back in 73 shots. 

Arnie Campbell, whom UCSD Head Coach Mike 
Wydra calls the Tritons' "most improved player," 
shot a 75, while Tom Brown finished out the scor-
ing for UCSD witb a 77. 

"It was our best match of the season," Wydra 
said. And surprisingly so. Torrey Pines has been a 
tougb course for most of the season and the Tritons 
have been competing without the injured Brock 
Shafer. 

"If you had asked me after Southern Califomia 
College whether we would break 300 at Torrey 
without [Shafer] I'd have said no," Wydra said. 

With the regular season nothing but a memory 
now, the Tritons face some intra-squad qualify-
ing rounds to see which members of the team will 
make up the San Diego contingent when they 
leave for King's Grant Golf Club in Fayetteville, 
North Carolina and the NCAA Tournament on 
May 14th. 

Tom Blown linn up • putt on .... w.y to • score of 77. 
Currently Abraham, Brown, and Hartford are locked in 

on ihe traveling team, with Campbell sitting pretty for the 
fourth slot. 

Should Shafer be able to return, he will join those four to 
round out the Tritons' fearsome five. If not, Alex Behrend, 
Brian Walter and Steve Lin will be fighting it out for the 
final position.

Tritons SheD sec 
ON FIRE: UCSD captures lotb-consecutive win, 8-2 
sr.ff Writer 

The UCSD baseball team's win-
ning ways continued with its 8-2 
victory over Southern California 

College on 
Thursday at 
Triton Field. 

The Tri-
tons rode the 
ann of Ryan 
Flanagan, 
wbo again 
proved tbat 
he is the ace 
of the pitch-
ing staff. 
Flanagan 
pitched eight 

innings of five-hit ball, allowing 
only one unearned run, while strik-
ing seven out and walking none. 

A positive twist of fate helped 
UCSD strike early against Vanguard 
starter Augie Pena. After Eric 
Quandt had reached on an infield hit 
to open the bottom of the first, des-
ignated hitter Craig Birk lifted a 
towering pop fly into right field. AB 
luck would have it, Birk's at-bat 
marked the only time all day that the 
sun peeked through the clouds, and 
the ensuing glare caused right fielder 
Alex Diu to lose track of the ball. 
Quandt went to third on the play. 
ams Miyake then lined a sac fly to 
center, giving UCSD a 1-0 lead. 

Witb two outs, Rick Ramirez 
smoked a drive to left, but the left 
fielder dropped the ball on the run. 

The error allowed Birt to score from 
first Dan O'Brien singled Ramirez 
home to give the Tritons a 3-0 lead. 

But, both Petia and Flanagan 
started posting goose eap.The Van-
guards finally broke through, scor-
ing a run in the top of the sixth when 
a ball scooted under the glove of 
Jason Aguilar in center field, allow-
ing Ken Turner to score. 

But UCSD answered quickly. 
With one out in the bottom of the 
sixth, O'Brien grounded a double 
down the left field line. Pena inten-
tionally walked Alberto Mendovil 
and one out later, hit Aguilar with a 
pitch to load the bases. Pena contin-
ued to struggle with his control, 
walking Quandt on four pitches to 
force a run home. 

Birk (3-5, 2 RBI's) followed with 
a run-scoring single, and Miyake 
lined a two-run single to left, giving 
tbe Tritons a 7-1 advantage. 

Flanagan (7-1) held sec in check 
before giving way to Kurt Luhrsen 
in tbe ninth. 

Every Triton starter had at least 
one hit, and as has been the trend 
throughout this remarkable season, 
UCSD scored seven of its eight runs 
when two were out. 

The 8-2 victory was UCSD's 10th 
in a row, and 20th out of its last 21 
games. It also ran the team's home 
record to a perfect 15-0. With three 
games remainina. the Tritons (26-
3) have virtually clinched bome-
field advantage for the upcoming 
NCAA Regional playoffs.

WREnn 
The Sports 
Hate Saga 
Continues 

Sports suck. 
There, I said it. Two weeks 

ago another columnist took the 
opinion that soccer is inferior, 
but that's too narrow a scope 
for my wrath. 

When I say sports suck, I 
mean every single aspect of 
every activity that was ever 
mentioned in the same breath 
as the word "sport." Horse 
racing, fencing, bodybuilding, 
yacht racing, football, basket-
ball , etc. They ' re all worthless 
and a waste of time. 

The worst thing about sports 
is that there 's just way too 
much scoring going on, 
especially in sports like 
football, where I have to take 
off my shoes and socks to keep 
a running tally of all those 
numbers. At least I have 
enough fingers to take care of 
most baseball and hockey 
scores. I tried to keep score at a 
basketball game once-I had to 
lie down after 10 minutes and 
couldn't get rid of the headache 
for three days.

CITY CHAMPS: UCSD's women's track and field edges out Point Lorna and Claremont for city championship 

Further, the{e's just too 
much damn strategy in some of 
these games. At least in tag, 
which is a game and not a 
sport, the athletes run around 
for a simple but apparent 
reason. In sports, athletes run 
around for all sorts of incom-
prehensible and complex 
reasons. While watching 
soccer, for instance, I have 
trouble concentrating on the 
game and using a bottle opener 
at the same time. I mean, it's 
hard work. 

And all of these set plays 
reaJly bamboozle me, espe-
cially when there are so many 
people moving at once. At least 
on TV, they make it easier by 
focusing on the person with the 
ball . I mean I can follow a 
"reverse" or "flea flicker" in 
football, but put more than four 
players on the screen at one 
time and smoke starts coming 
out of my ears. My friends tell 
me they can actually hear my 
head getting ready to explode. 

And what's with all these 
statistics? Who needs to keep 
track of all these numbers? I 
have a bard enougb time 
remembering what number to 
call for an ambulance or the 
police. There's no need for me

It didn't quite carry the same magnitude as the 
Bobby Riggs-Billie Jean King rivalry, but tbe 
battle between Triton tracksters Michaela 

TRR[K 
~~ 
FIELD 

Monaban and Muk Johnson 
in the 4OO-meter hurdles was 
just as important to the 
UCSD track and field team 
at last weekend's San Diego 
City Championships. 

"It was such a big incen-
tive to beat Mark [Johnson]," 
said Monahan. "I'm just glad 
the best man won." 

Running for an undis-
closed personal bet, 
Monaban not only squeaked 
by teammate Jobnson witb a 

time of 64.18 (verses his 64.59), but also fired up 
the Triton squad into a rooting frenzy. 

"Anytime the team comes together like tbat, 
it's a good thing," said Head Coach Tony Salerno. 

Coming off the momentum from the Monahan-
Johnson race, the UCSD women's squad domi-
nated the rest of the field, beating out aaremont 
College 75-69 and pummeling Point Lorna 
Nazarene 74-56. 

The Triton men also did exceptionally well, 
nosing out Point Loma for the first time in the 
team's history. 

"Point Lorna [Nazarene] bu always been a 
barometer for our program," Salerno said. "To 
beat them is just a testament to the way all our 
athletes performed." 

Long-distance standout JJ. Castner apin set 
the pace for the men's side, euily capturins first

Alan Grant and Earnest auk also chalked up 
solid performances for the Triton men, grabbing 
first in the 800 (1:53.91) and 400 meters (49.18), 
respectively. 

Other Triton bigbligbts on the men's side 
included Matt Ringer (third in 1,500 meters), 
Jobn Walsb (tbirdin5,OOOmeters)andJoe Cavan 
(fifth in 100 meters). 

Cowboy bat-wearing hurlers Muc Sleenhof 
and Randy Buehler were strong in tbe pit events, 
most notably taking second in the discus (152'0") 
and fourth in the hammer (161'11"), respec-
tively. 

Geoff Lambert (fifth in hammer), Jeff Schnitz 
(third in javelin), Damian Coleman (third in long 
jump), Steve Sargeant (second in the higb jump), 
Colin Williams and Creed Stary (both second in 
the pole vault) also put in strong efforts for the 
UCSDmen. 

On the victorious Triton women's side, Tara 
Monagban led the way by hurling a personal 
record of over five feet in the bammer (143' 10"), 
while Lisa Sbepud stormed the 1 OO-meter hurdles 
(first in 15.42). 

Also adding solid track efforts were Michele 
Domico(12.9S)and Sarah Wayson (13.77) in the
