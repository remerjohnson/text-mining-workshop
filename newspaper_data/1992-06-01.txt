implicated by anonymous source in 
smuggling of tropical fish from Mexico 
By Eric Schmidt 
Associate News Editor 

The Scripps In titutionofOceanogmphy (SIO)Aquarium 
is under federal inve~tigation for allegedly encouraging the 
smuggling oflive Mexican fish across the borderon May 21. 
according to a source who wished to remain anonymous. 
Federal officials. however. refuse to confinn or deny that an 
investigation is taking pia e. 

According to SIO Associate Director Tom Collins. a 
private yacht bearing fish caugh t off the coast of Mexico 
entered U.S. waters with the intention f donating the 
allegedly illegal fish to SIO's new aquarium. 

Collins emphasized that the yacht "was not on an official 
Scripps collecting trip." and said SIO is currently conduct-
ing an investigation into the incident. "There were no 
Scripps employees on board," he added. 

The anonymous source. an SIO employee, told the 
Guardiwi that aquarium Director Don Wilkie hat! a~ket! the 
. hip to en ter U.S. waters wi thout the pem,it neccs!'.ary to 
impon Mexican fish. The employee funher alleged that 
Wilkie himself panicipated in the illegal collection of the 
Mexican fish. 

Wilkie forwarded calls on the issue to Collins, who said 
he is also investigating ~he possible involvement of SIO 
employees in the incident. 

The UCSD Native American Student Alliance held its first annual Pow Wow at the 
La Jolla Project (Stonehenge) to celebrate 500 years of "cultural persistence.· 

Collins said he received notice from an employee that the 
yacht intended to cross into U.S. waters with the intention of

Tax Proposal 
Qualifies for Ballot 
By PhIlip Michaels 
Senior Staff Writer 

A tax relief proposal that could generate between 
$585 million and $1.2 billion in extra revenue has 
received enough signatures to be placed on the Cali-
fornia ballot in November . 

TIle proposal, sponsored by the California Tax 
Refonn Association and supponed by the University 
of California Student Association (UeSA), would 
close corporate tax loopholes to increase revenue for 
the financially strapped California budget. 

According to fonner UCSA Vice President John 
Edson, 652,000 signatures were collected, approxi-
mately 300,000 more than were required.

Interest Groups Call for 
More UC Regent Diversity 
• Amendments also call for 
more regent accountability 
By Karen Cheng 
Staff Writer 

A coalition of student and public interest 
groups convened last TIlUrsday in Sacra-
mento to launch a campaign to refonn the 
UC Board of Regents. 

At a press conference, the groups called 
for the state legislature to place a propo i-
tion on the ballot which would modify the 
anicles of the California Con titution that 
govern the regents. 

Changes would include a diversifica-
tion of the regents and an increase in the 
accountability of the regents to taxpayers 
and students. 

Some of the group panicipating were 
the University of California Student A 50-
ciation (UCSA). the Latin American Issue 

Forum, California Common Cause, and the 
California Public Interest Research Group 
(CALPIRG). 

According to UeSA Executive Director 
Lee Butterfield, the proposed refonns would 
trengthen the constitutional requirements 

that the regents be representative of the 
ethnic, gender and economic diversity of 
the state's population. 

The proposed amendments to the re-
gents' constitution would also look to in-
crease the regents' accountability on issues 
such as UC executive salaries. approval of 
student fee increases and the recognition of 
student and faculty authority on ue cam-
puse . 

"This has been immering for a long

Through some administrative snafu, the county ne-

Mar. I. When Isla Vistan learned of the law's demise 
Thursday. the nonnally calm weekend took on a festive 
atmosphere sometimes reminiscent of bashes like Hal-

Chicana Teacher Awarded Full 
Professorship; First In UCSB History 

After a long struggle, OJicano Studies Department Olair 
Yolanda Broyles-Gonzales was granted full professorship 
early this month, making her the first OJicana in UCSB history 
promoted to thal rank. 

1lle climb began in October 1991 when Broyles-Gonzalez 
was denied the promotion despite unanimous recommenda-
tions from both campus departments which she teaches in. 

It is very rare that a case for promotion is denied when 
departmental recommendations are unanimous, said Broyles-
Gonzalez, who teaches in the Germanic. Orienlal and Slavic 
Lnnguages Department and the Chicano Studies Department. 

She lIppealed her case in January, once again with unani-
mous departmental suppon, and succeeded in becoming the 
first faculty member in the Chicano Studies Departmenl to 
reach the level of full professor. 

Administrators involved in the decision declined to com-
ment on either case. 

As one of only a handful of women of color in the UC 
system to receive a full professorship, Broyles-Gonzalez said 
her fight to move up the tenure-track ladder is exemplary of the 
problems that exist for all minority women in the work force. 

"I think my case speak for the barriers that exist for all 
women of color," he said. "Unless things change. we are 
going to move into the 21 Sl Century with the same seclusion 
and barriers that are in place now." 

Despite her success. Broyles-Gonzalez said the system still 
does not 'work for many people.

In a telephone interview Friday. 
Weddington said tha t she expects 

the court to " low key" the abortion

strictions on obtaining an abortion,

She said it rcpre~ented a woman's

he related some of her own

~he was di~couraged from goi ng to

Playing the 
Name Game 

By Jason Snell 
Senior Staff Writer 

It wasn't suppo!>ed to happen qllitl' like this. 
By the time the students who make up the first 

g raduating class of UCSO's Fifth College had eamed 
their diploma. ... their college should have already been 
given a new name, like three of UCSO's four other 
colleges. 

Instead. a committee made up ofstudent~. faculty. 
staff and Fifth College Provost James Lyon came up 
dry in the !>earch for a name th(\\ began over a year ago. 

"We initially hoped to get aname by the time the first 
class gmduated." Lyon says. "Bul by lFall 199IJthe. 

i~sue had become soconte nt ious that it ~emcd prudent 
to . .. try again after the first graduation." 

The failure to name Fifth College certainly doesn't 
stem from a bckofposs iblecandidates. [n Fall 1990the 
commiuee mai led a note to all of the college's students 
at home and abroad. and a.~ked for suggestions for the 
college's name. In May J99I.two Fifth College "town 
meeting "were held on the subject. 

But Lyon says he is determined to find a name. 
preferably the name of a person. He pointed out that the 
UCSO colleges with the lowest number of applicants

Fifth College Comes of Age 
Despite growing pains, the newest college is proud of its innovative global perspective 

By David Snow 
Staff Writer 

Fifth College has never had any fifth-year seniors. Unti l 
this year. it never even had any fourth -year seniors. Back in 
September 1988, all Fifth College had was 459 disoriented 
freshmen who had accepted admission into a brand-new 
college that touted itself as having a "global perspe tive." 

Four years later. Fifth still bills itself as UCSO's 
"intemat ional" co llege. and many of the original freshm:U1 
class will graduate this June. thoroughly globali zCC: and 
ready to face the modem world, the making of which they 
all undoubtedly appreciate by now. But has Fifth College 
achieved what its creators hoped it would? 

As the newest member in U O's family of colleges. 
Fifth replaced Warren a.~ the "growth" college. the college 
created to absorb the university's c!xpanding enrolhllc!l1t. 
Barring further budget restrJints. Fifth's student population 
is expected to match that of the other four collegc!~ by 1997. 
Understandably, the newest college has e perienced 
growing pains. but as Fifth administrJtors and students 
argue. it hU!> succeeded in remaining true to the uniyue 
idC<ls upon which it was founded . 
In The Beginning 

"It's a complex problem, ~tarting a coJlege," say~ 
Anthropology Professor Roy O· Andrade. After Warren 
College stabilized at around 3.000 ·tudents. the univen.ity 
administmtion recognized the need to add another college 
to the campus. On instructions from the Academic Senate, 
0 ' Andrade and ten other faculty :Idvisors spent nearly two 
years constructing the Fifth CoJlege curriculum and 
selecting administmtors before the college opened its doors 
to students in the Fall of 1988. 

"Fifth College was to have its own thrust in the direction 
of things intemational," e)(plains O'Andrade, "I thought it 
was a great idea." After conducting a careful campus-wide 
earch for the right provo t, the Academic Senate offered 

the job to German Litemture Professor Jamie Lyon. 
But Fifth still suffers from the lack of a physical 

location. Aside from the Pepper Canyon apartments and the 
wood office building in the Matthews complex, UCSO tour 

guides don't have much to show pro pective Fifth students. 
And this situation i not expected to be remedied soon. " I 
went 15 years without any permanent location," remembers 
Warren College Provost Oavid Wong. "Phy ical facility is 
a difficulty for new colleges." 
The Cunlculum 

Fifth College students can dmw comparisons between 
televangelists and shamans, between job discrimination and 
foot binding. between modem America and the Dobe 
!Kung. TIley have been known to drop names like Thomas 
M re, Homer, Mo e' and Jim Mom on in the same 
conversation. They have also been known to heave a weary 
sigh of relief at the end of their sophomore year. This all 
can be allributed to Fifth's unique two-year-Iong Making of 
the Modem World (MMW ) series, which both students and 
faculty seem to reverently regard as a kind of intellectual 
boot camp: "!t·s a good e)(perience, but. .. ,'.

general education 

" 

my own I would never have found out about. But there 
were 'times when it didn' t seem so worthwhile." 

Problems emerged in the third and fourth quarters of 
MMW. and they still persbt to some extent. " It runs 
smoother now." explains 0 ' Andmde, "but the third and 
fourth quarters tend to be hard. In between you have to get 
from the end of the classical em to the 19th Century in two 
quarters." Student and staff [evels of frustration run high in 
these two courses. Ouring the maiden voyage of MMW 3. 
administrators asked professors to cu t the required reading 
in half in order to preserve the mental health of stressed-Qut 
students. 

With so much material to cover, problems sometimes 
surface over what issues are most important from the time 
periods to be studied. Feldman recalls, "In the fourth 
quarter. we had professors [who] were really femini st. It 
seemed we weren't learning the cu lture or hi story of the 

country, but rather the 
professor's opinion on 
how the count!)' was sexist

all these intere ting goals 
for a social sc ience 
sequence and a humani-

tle~ sequence. They 
Jidn't work sepanuely, 
so what we did was

O'Andrade.

we had the Iliad. So it's not your standard course,

What the commi ttee 
came up with was six 
quarters of history,literature, sociology, philosophy and a 
conglomeration of other disciplines that span all of human 
history. from the era when they weren't yet as smart as 
dogs right up to this moming's news. "The course was so 
strange." says O'AndrJde. "We had stones and bones, we 
had Yanomamo [Indians), we had the Iliad. So it's not your 
standard course. And we weren' t clear whether student 
would like it or thought it would make sense." 

Fifth senior Uri Feldman ran the MMW gamut. " I

'holar, by a gener.ilist." surmises MMW TA Mark Slouka. 
Although his area of spec ialty is American literature and 
history, Siouka has been a TA for all six courses. "I feel the

ambitious I know of. I think its strengths and flaw. are both

FIFTH 
ContInued from paCe 4 

Revelle College Provo t Tom 
Bond compares Fifth's structured 
curriculum to Revelle" . Despite 
the rigid requirements. survey 
result how Fifth and Revelle 
tudents as being the most 

satisfied with their general 
education classes. This year, Fifth 
passed Revelle for the first time in 
tudent satisfa tion. Bond claims 

that Reve lle Humanitie is 
beginning to show signs of 
in fluence from MMW, as i Third 
College's Oimensions of Culture. 
"The odd numbered colleges tend 
to have tructured curricula, and 
that is something I believe in." 
says Bond. ' 'I'm a big upporter 
of Fifth College." 

"The Making of the Modem 
World." says Lyon, "for all its 
bumps and bruises - and it 's had 
some - has been successful as a 
course. We were told when we 
tarted that it would take us two or 

three years to get it right. but I still 
wanted to get it right immedi-
ately." 

O'Andrade hares similar 
sentiments after having taught 
MMW I for four years. "I think 
it 's been an outstanding success. 
The students still bring a lot of 
enthusiasm. They haven't gotten 
hard or cynical or nasty yet." 

The Fifth College plug in the 
UCSO catalogue says that 
although time abroad is not 
required, students are strong I y 
encouraged to study or work in a 
foreign country during their 
undergraduate years. Fifth College 
admi nistrdtors estimate that about 

40 percent of this year's seniors 
have been abroad through 
university-sponsored programs to 
33 different countries. This is not 
as high as they would like, but it 
far outnumbers the approximately 
two to four percent for the other 
colleges at UCSO. 
1he Students 

"That first class surprised 
everyone," remembers Lyon. In 
the first place, the registrar had 
anticipated that 400 student 
would enroll, and over 450 
showed up. In addition, half of 
them were social sciences majors, 
and 60 percent of them were 
women. 

The fre hman clas of 1991 
wasn't much different. As a re ult, 
Fifth suffers from the reverse of 
the problem that afflicts Revelle. 
According to Bond, Revelle has 
always had difficulty attracting 
enough tudent from the Hu-
manitie and Social Sciences. 

Fifth has problems attracting 
Engineering and Science majors. 
Although Engineering majors 
made up just under 21 percent of 
all incoming Freshmen to UCSO 
in 1991. they accounted for only 
about nine percent of Fifth' s 
incoming class. "Fifth needs to 
develop an image that is broader 
than international studies," 
remarks Bond. 

"There are a lot of things 
we've had to adjust ," says Lyon. 
"but the general vision of the 
college is pretty much intact. I'm 
surprised that it's working as well 
as it is. The whole ethos of the 
college has been esrablished. 
Students here, most of them, 
really think internationally. They

" It 's hard to have successful 
innovations in higher education," 
in ists O 'Andrade. Administrators 
claim that Fifth' s success has 
brought it UC system-wide. and 
even national, recognition. 

O'Andmde is credited with 
having said in his MMW I class, 
''I'm an ideas man, don't bother 
me with detail !" Perhaps this is 
the nature of Fifth's success: if the 
idea works, the details will work

"There will not be a formal 
election on the subject." he says. 
"We will work for as wide-spread 
acceptance as we can get ... but 
we won't get a majority." 

Ultimately. Lyon has the final 
say in which name gets forwurded 
to the UCSO Campus Naming 
Comminee. Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson and the UC Board of 
Regents. He fully expects a large 
amount of initial di satisfucti n 
with the final decision. 

While many prospective 
college names seem to be dead in 
the Willer. others stiU have a 
chance of becoming the winner of 
the numing sweepstakes. 

Sugge tions for conceptual 
college names include Pungaea 
College. a name which has been 
supported by former A.S. 
President John Edson. Pangaea is 
the name of the land mass which 
existed before Earth's continents 
drifted apart. 

Other conceptual choices 
include intemational, World. 
Atlas, Gaia. Sankjfa. and Unity 
College. 

Other names considered as 
possi ble candidates were Gandhi , 
John F. Kennedy, Woodrow 
Wilson. Eleanor Roosevelt , Marie 
Curie, Emi ly Green Balch. Clark 
Kerr. Oavid Gardner, Sally Ride, 
Emelia Earhart, and Barbara 
Tuchman. 

One possible name for the 
college was J . William Fulbright 
College. named after the late 

SPECTACLE 5 

Arkansas senator who was a 
renowned internationalist. But 
FUlbright's name is. according to 
Lyon. no longer in the running, 
because research into hi~ Senate 
voting record revealed that he 
voted against numerous civi l 
rights bills. 

A less convincing rea!>on for 
disqualifying a name was rai ed 
over the possibility of naming the 
college after George Marshall. 
Marshall. a former U.S. ~ecretary 
of state. formulated the Marshall 
Plan. which helped rebuild the 
shattered economie~ of po~t­
World War II - urope. 

Marshall' s !> tock in the Fifth 
College naming ~weep~take~ 
dropped considerably. however. 
when research turned lip a 
~kcl ·ton in his closet: hc was a 
geneml in the anlled force~ during 
World War II. 

Tuchman College. namcd after 
prominent hi storian Barbam 
Tuchman. is the name Lyon 
currently seems to be promoting. 
In addition to Tuchman's stature 
in her field, Lyon says he is 
"strongly disposed" 10 naming the 
college after a woman. 

"A decision will be made," he 
says. "No decision will represent a 
majority, but a decision will be 
made by this time next year." 

As the past years have taught 
Lyon and the rest of the would-be 
Fifth College namers, finding an 
accepwbfe name for the college 
will be extremely difficult. As 

~upporters of George Marshall 
College would complain. if 
fighting in a war against the Nazis 
disqualifies you, there may be I/O 
acceptable choice.

mencement will not have 
a real impact on the

tance that the college 
placed upon studying 
abroad. 

"We greatly empha-
size studying abroad in

Lyon. "Fifth college is beginning 
to look like mo t universities. A 
distribution amongst all majors is 
occurring. Although political

Lyon expressed his concem 
thaI the emphasis upon studying 
abroad "may slow people down." 
But a large number of the 
gr.lduating seniors have been 
abroad without creating a problem 
for graduation. Lyon explains.

are entering Ihe Peace Corps. 
Seveml others are going on a

and many will be interning in

After graduation many students 
will attend grJduate school or 
professional school. or enter the 
work force. However, the fact 
that they will no longer be 
enrolled in Fifth College does not 
mean that they will necessarily

The deferred compensation plan 
gcnerJted a public uproar when the 
figures of the salary increases were 
released by the university earlier 
this year. 

" It wasll' l the numbers so much 
as that people thought Ihey weren' t 
being dealt with fairly . The univer-
sity was criticized for that," Kolb 
said. He added that the regents de-
cided to fully disclose infomlation 
about the salary increases in order to 
be "responsive to the public." 

State Senator Quentin Kopp (1-
San FrJncisco) said of Bmdy' s par-
ticipation in the deferred compen-
sation plan ," it ' sobscene- he's the 
architect of this obscene plan. He' s 
acted to the detriment oftht: people

Kopp, who has openly criticized 
university officials in tht: past. said 
he was plea. edtohearabout Bmdy's

he were leaving July I. 1992." 

Kolb emphasized that Brady did

UCSA 
ContInued from paCe l. 
Associmion. is working to ~uppon 
the tax reform meru,ure, 

"Thi will be the focal point for 
the UCSA until ovember. because 
central toourfee troubles isa lackof 
revenue in the state." Edson said. 

The petition signatures are cur-
rently being verified. but sponsors 
of the initiative believe the verifica-
tion process will be completed in 
time for the proposal to be on the 
November ballot. 

The initiative would repeal the 
tall on snacks. candy. bottled water. 
newspapers and magazines. as well 
as cut the stale sales tax by .25 
percent. The renters credit would 
also be returned to its pre- l99I 
amount. 

In order lO generate revenue. the 
initiat ive would then increase in-
come tax rates for corporations, 
while closing l oophole~ that allow 
companies todeduct taxable income. 

UCSD AS!>ociated Students Vice 
President ExtemalColin Wilson said 
he believes the tax reform measure 
would not include tax increases that 
would hanl1 businesses. 

"The initiative does not impose 
taxes that are not feasible:' Wilson 
said. " It provides a small revenue 
increase, which we need right now." 

The measure would also include 
an oil severance tax, which charges 
oil companies for drilling on state 
land. A six-percent oil sever,mce 
tax. for example. would raise $250 
million in revenue. Currently. Cali-
fornia is the only stale without this 
tax . 

The initiati ve would also impose 
a three-percenr tax on companies 
which produce over 300,000 bar-
rels per month, 

One of the major reasons that 
Governor Pete Wilson has opposed 
such legislation in the pa~t is his fear 
that businesses will be driven out of 
California by increased corpomte 
taxes, 

Edson said that the taxes included 
in this measure will only target com-
panies which must remain in the 
state. "It's ludicrous to say Chevron 
wouldstoppumpinggasoffofSanta 
Barbara if they had to pay a tax." 
Edson said. 

The ballot measure would gen-
erJ.te approximately $500 million in 
the first year of enactment and $2 
billion in the following years. ac-
cording to estimates by the Califor-
nia Taxpayers Association, 

According to Edson. ifplacedon 
the November ballot. the measure 
will face stiff opposition from cor-
porations. banks, oi I companies. and 
the California Chamber of Com-
merce. 

"It'll be extremely difficult be-
cause we' II be taking on many of the 
corporate interests in the state," 
Edsen said. 

However, Lenny Goldberg, of 
the California Ta>. Reform Associa-
tion, is hopeful that the ballot mea-
sure will receive support. particu-
larly among members of the slate 
legislature. 

"There's pretty strong support 
among Democr.ns. I'd be pretty sur-
prised if there was much support 
among Republicans. even though 
[the measure) provides laX relief for 
ordinary citizens. This will really 
show who [the Republicans] repre-
sem." Goldberg said.

abortion among the top two or three 
political issues. 

According to Weddington. 
American public opinion i "clearly 
pro<hoice." She said the members 
of the Supreme Coun are aware that 
"if the Court overtumed Roe [in 
Julyl ... there would be a tremen-
dou public reaction. and it would 
as ure that George Bush get beat." 

She added, " I dOn't really think 
abortion is a con elVative versus 
liberal issue. To me it has become a 
religiou is ue." 

Weddington aid she is hopeful 
that more women may be elected in 
November. giving bener represen-

tat ion to women's issues. "Women 
understand these issues better than 
[menl." she said. even if men .lre 
sympathetic. 

As an example. Weddington 
noted thai she was one of the women 
testi fying against Clarence Thomas 
at his confirmation he<lrings. When 
the women finished testifying. he 
said, "One of the senators lectured 
us- it was like we wereschoolchil-
dren. He said, ' the problem with 
you women ... [is] you ' re too dra-
matic.· .. 

Last weekend, Weddington com-
pleted writing Quesr;ol/ o/Clto;ce, a 
history of the Roe decision. The 
book will be released Sept. 16. a 
dale he said was chosen to coincide 
with rudents' rerum to college.

According to Kim Alexander. a 
policy analyst for Common Cause, 
" If the regents reflected the eco-

they might be more responsive to

The Califomia State Constitu-

regents appointed by the Govemor 
are white males. 

Latino I ssue~ Forum representa-

concerned about the politi ized ap-
pointment of regents. 

" It ·s all politics. and we need to 
change the process by which the 
regents are appoi nted (and give] a

not. alhletics are a big parl of our

BUl does anyone reallycareaboul 
the yokels from Cal Lutheran and 
UCSD? 

Ullimately, it comes down 10 Ihe 
entire college experience. A feel ing 
of pride in the in titulion where you 
slaved for four, fi ve or six years. A 
feeli ng of belonging. A feeling that 
you share something pecial with 
Ihe olher 16,999 sludents on cam-
pus lhat nobody else at any mher 
college instilulion has. 

Athletics are by no means the 
only way this happens. But they are 
a big way. 

Whm wi ll it take? Unfonunately, 
il lakes big-time athletics. II takes 
recognizable figures playing in rec-
ognizable events. And on the col-
lege level, that means Division I. 

You wanl 10 know why Ihis

cares enough aboul it 

That's sad. ThaI 's also fact. 
If UCSD ever wants to be re-

garded as a truly great university , as 
an inslilulion buill on pride and tra-
dition, where Ihe sludents, faculty. 
siaff, local residents and adminis-
tration all feel they have a stake in

WINTER '92 IN REVIEW Fencers Find Successin '92 
A UCSD Soap Opera: The 
Tritons Hang Tough 
• De pite key injurie , women's basketball hangs on 
to fmi h season with a seven-game win streak 
By Gregg Wrenn 
Associate Sports Editor 

De piteayearinwhichherteam 
went I 6-8 and ended its season with-
oUI a playoffbenh. UCSD women's 
basketball He:ld Coach Judy Ma-
Ione is pleased with her team's ac-
complishments. 

Indeed. after struggling in mid-
season due to key injuries. the Tri -
ton • year-ending seven-game win 
streak would be something any 
coach could be happy about. 

UCSD, wirmerof 15 str..light and 
a playoff benh the year before. en-
tered the season bent on doing more 
of the same. But the year Slaned off 
on the wrong foot as the Tritons 
were nipped by Biola in the opener 
of the Redlands ToulTH1ment. 69-68 
in their season opener. 

They rebounded the next night 
with an 87-56 trouncing of Azusa 
Pacific. and the roller oaster ea-
son was underway. 

Things reully fell apan when 

UCSD lost starting point guard 
Kuthleen Alvarez and forward Carl 
Young to injuries. B th pluyers were 
crucial to the Trit ns' auack, with 
Alvarez having perfected her role as 
playmaker and quanerbuck. und 
Young. the all-time leading scorer 
in U SD history. 

Both players mi cd five games. 
but it tooklongerthan that for UCSD 
to get back on track . "Even after 
they came back. they weren't 100 
percent the first couple of games 
back. Plus it takes a while for the 
team 10 leam how to play with them 
again. getthem back into the game." 
Malone ·Iid. 

Malone, whose teum lost only 
two games to Divi ion 1lI oppo-
nents this yeur. suw the loss to 
Claremont College as the low point 
of the S~L<;()n . 

"After that game we fell out of 
being ranked number four in the 
region," Malone said. 

But the turnaround came wi th 

Dan McDowelltGun.iWl 
Lisa Beaver was a main reason for the Tritons ' success this year. 
the team' first win over Cal 
Lutheran. a triumph which got the 
Tritons rolling on their season end-
ing seven-game streak. 

"We had trouble with all of the 

injuries and then readjusting," 
Malone said. "But that game we 
finally realized that we were a better 
team. Everythingjustcametogether, 
and we played to our potential." 

Looking toward the NCAA 
championships. the UCSD fencing 
team set sail for Cal State Fullerton 
in March hoping to parry its way to 
an upset victory or two. 

Unfortunately forthe Tritons, the 
modem day rnuskateers couldn't 
quiteoverc mesomesharpcompe-
tition. 

The UCSD women's team was 
able to grab founh place in the con-
test as it was led by Yumi Nishiyama 
who finished in eighth place - the 
best for any UCSD sword-wielder. 
Rory Velasquez went on to finish in 
11th. 

On the men's side, Aaron Shebest 
fini shed third in the foil competi-
tion. Gram Dawson grabbed 10th in 
the foil while Chris Moody finished 
eighth in the epee. 

TIle season was a strong one for 
UCSD, especially the women's 
team, which finished with a perfect 
record in the Southem Califomia 
Conference_ Earlier this year. the 
women shut out USC and Cal Tech 
16-0 in a bout at Cal Tech. 

'Tmreally happy with the team," 
said UCSD Head Coach Allison 
Reed at the time. 

"We 're steadily improving. All 
year long we' ve been fencing higher 
than expecliations," Reid said.

The Same Old Story for Swimming 
• Triton have a good 
regular eason, but run 
into Kenyon at NCAAs 
By Suzanne Porush 
Scaff Wmer 

The men 's and women's swim-
minganddiving squads wrapped lip 
a suc,e~~rul sea"on in late March. 
both finishi ng ~econd to Kenyon at 
the N AA Division 111 champion-

~hip~. 
Tht: ~quads improved at t:a 'h 

meet thr ughout the season. Ac-
cording to CS D Head Coach Doug 
Boyd. by the national champi 11-
ships. ome swimmers were break-
ing their personal bests for the third 
and founh time. 

"Nutiomlls were definitely the 
highlight of the season: ' Boyd said. 
"We had an excellent men's 200-
yard freestyle relay." 

Much of th is year's success can 
be credited to the UCSD women's 
diving squad, which placed four 
divers in the top eight in both the 
one-meter and three-meter events at 

nationals. "TImt was definitely the 
be~ t team accomplilohlllent." Boyd 
said. "That had never been done 
before in the hbtory of N AAs.'· 

Three Triton women qualified 
for the national champion~hips at 
the Kenyon meet in Fcbruary. J amee 

lIch. Tanya Setran and Jocelyn 
Rothbard made their cut" in the 50-
yard freestyle. 200 back and 200 
frec respectively. 

There was a I t of close compe-
tition in the diving ponion of the 
Kenyon meel as UCSD's Jill Jack-
~on took first in the three-meter 
event. 

At the conference meet. the Tri-
tonscont inued to improve with seven 
first-time qualifiers for the NCAA 
championships. Among the men 
were Gabe Spire in the IOO-yard 
freestyle, Mike Pahland in the 100-
yard freestyle. Pete Shim in the 200-
yard 1M and the 200-yard breast-
stroke. Tom Perkins irithe 1000yard 
breastslfOke and Nale Szymanow ki 
in the 200-yard freestyle. 

UCSD\ diving squad had an 

e ccllentconferencemeet.JillJack-
~on was named diverofthe year and 
UC D diving Head Coach Tom 
Scotty was named coach of the year 
for the second time in four ~easons. 

At the NCAA Division ((( na-
tionals, the men's and women 
swi mming and diving squads all 
swnm well, although they could not 
dethrone the Lords. Kenyon' sOlen' s 
team 'wam to its 13th con ecutive 
title and its women came away with 
their ninth. 

On the women's ide, 109 of 
UCSD's 256 points can be credited 
to the diving quad. Jackson took 
second in the one-meter. Ruth 
Prange finished in fourth place in 
the three-meter while Jackson took 
fifth. 

Connie Romero wam well in 
the 500-yard and 1,650-yard 
free tyles, and Sabrina Lum broke 
her own school record in the 200-
yard butterfly with a time of2:06.I. 

On the men's side, the meet 
tarted off strong in the 200-yard 

freestyle relay. with what Boyd felt 

o;r. McDowelliGu.7Ml 
Pete Shim qualified in two events for the NCAA championships. 
was the best swim of the meet. John 
Rowers. Spire, Pahland and Judd 
Glasser led the Triton to a first-
place finish in the event. 

Individual highlights were Travis 
Miller, who won the 200-yard back-
stroke for the second consecutive 
year and Taylor Spanglor, who took 

ixth in the 1000yard breaststroke 
and eighth in the 200-yard breast-
stroke with a time of2:07.53, break-
ing the UCSD record. 

Boyd was pleased with the team. 
"They totally amazed me." Boyd 
said. "Both the men 's and women's 
squads had a successful eason."

In 1981. at the age of 10, I ~at

ticking down and three very large 
defenders in his face, lofted J pass 
into the deep right comer of the

reach higher than I'd ever ~en a

out of the air, throw his arm

NCAA DIVISION III NATIONAL TRACK CHAMPIONSHIPS

By Gregg Wrenn 
ASSOCiate Sports Editor 

After it was all over. the CSD track team had 
broken more record~ than Ca.sey K'lsem going 
berserk on Americu's Top 40. The women fin-
ished in six th place at the CAA Division HI 
national champiollshlp~ wi th 34 points. whi le the 
men placed 12th, their best fini,h ever. wi th 24. 

Perhaps there', something ~pecial about the 
Waterville. Maine [lir, or the water or maybe 
both. Whatever it was, it ~e t SD's Erica Wash-
ingt n on fire. The junior ~printer put on an 
unbelievable ,how at the meet, ~lIing a new 
school record every time ~he :.tepped on t he track. 

She I-otarted out by ,hattcring the 100-meter 
mark in her ljualifying heat. buming through in 
12.04 ~econcls. Her major rival for the national 
champion!-hip, MontciairSwte 'sShantay Bmme. 
put the pres~ure n Wa~hington with il 12.02 
mark in her ljualifying heat. 

Washington gunned down Brame in the fi-
nab. however. The Triton broJ..e her own day-old 
record by rossing the tape in 12.0 Ito capture the 
national title. 

Meanwhile, Wa:,hington wa, helping to rc-
write the record b ks a~ part of the women's 
4)( I relay team. In their ljualifying heat, the 
squad of Renee Sprowl. Yvette Marzu llo. Mich-
elle Milledge and Washington broke the VCSD 
school record wi th a time of 47.96. 

The next day, the team went out and did it 
again. lowering the mar" to 47.79 seconds. good 
enough for fourth place ovemll. 

Denise McFayden tumed out to be another 
major force for the Tritons as she took second in 
two events. The senior. who had also qualified 
earlier in the season to run in the 800- and 5,000-
meter races, fini shed the 1.500 in 4:35.09 and the 
3.000 with a time of 9:59.84. 

Jill Lyday al placed for VCSD. taking sixth 
in the discus with a throw of 138- 11. .. 1t was good

championship .It was a great way to goout," 

For the first time in UCSD's history. every 
oneofthe six women whomadethetriptothe ' 
national meet ended up as an All-American. 

Meanwhile. the men 's team was busy 
making some history of its own, Stanforth 
knows that his hammer program is the best in 
thecounlry. but the rest of Division III found 

that out for themselves. The Tritons were led 
by senior Scott Sargeant, owner of the long-
est hammer throw in Division In history. 
Making the trip with Sargeant were two more 
hammermen. Jeff Taylor and Paul Cogbill. 
who are often overlooked because of their 
recOrd-setting teammate.

Year of Success Ends in 
Disaster for Men's Hoop 
• Tritons win 17 in a row 
before falling to Cal 
Lutheran in tournament 
By Ken Perlman 
Sports Editor 

A funny thing happened to the 
UCSD men's basketball tearn on 
the way to the NCAA Divi ion III 
final. 

Funny that is, unless you're a 
Triton fan, 

For VCSD. which entered the 
1992 tournament in the midst of a 
I ~game win streak and 22-4 on the 
year, the road to the final four looked 
to be a smooth one. 

Smooth that is. until the 

Kingsmen of Cal Lutheran got their 
engines revving and blew by the 
Triton so fast that VCSD looked 
like it forgot to shift out of neutrJI. 

CLU made its way to the Main 
Gym on Saturday, Mar. 7, and a few 
hours later, made its way home with 
an 88-70 upset win in the 
tournament's second round, 

The playoff game marked the 
third time in the same season that 
VCSD had taken on the Kingsmen. 
Admittedly. UCSD Head Coach 
Tom Marshall was a little nervous.

NOTHING Is FOR CERTAIN IN 
CALIFORNIA'S SENATE RACES 
By Philip Michaels. Associate Opinion Editor 

INA YEAROFOUTSIDER ANDIDATES.ANTHNCUMBE TSE TI-melll and charbmatic Texas bi ll ionaire~, the United State~ Senate races in Cal ifomia have been rcceived with the same univer.al 
enthusia.~m as the America's up. Perhaps this i~ an unfair com pari-

~on - ::tfter all. the America \ up actual ly received SOll/i' new~ 
coverage. With one day until the June 2 primary, the main ljue~tion 

about thi~ election ~ecll1~ to be. "What ir we held a Senate race, and 
nobody noticed'?" 

This certainly isn't becau~e ofa ,hortage or eandidate~ . With both 
~eats available, the number of candidate~ i~ ~Iightly greater than the 
number of late-night TV talk ~how ho~t~. Only a few fron t-runner~ 
have emerged frumthc pack, and even tho~e remain largely unkno':vn 
outside of thei r home regions. 

Thcre are rea.,ons why the Senate races haven't been given the full 
;Jnd undivided attention of t he media and the publ ic. TIll! c.unpaign had 
the misfortune of taking place at the same time as the execution of 
Robert Alton Harris. the Los Angeles riots. and the risc of H. Ro~~ 
Perot. It was only inevitable that these events would over~hadow a 
couple of election c;unpaigns. 

But whether publicized or nOlo the show must go on, with some of 
the races actually shaping up to have intriguing political implicJtion;,. 
This year's Senate primaries have gone beyond mere intramural rJces 
that decide who the contenders arc in November.

This mce is the battleground be-
tween old-~ty le conservatism mlCltlle

the conservative side is Bruce 
Herschensohn. a telev ision corrmlCn-
talor and fonner Nixon speech writer 
who Wi II imll F. Buckley refcrs to a<; a 
"blood brolher." Herschensohn fi ts 
the typical conservative mold - op-
po:.ed to big government. pro-bu~i­

His ideological opponent in this

Tom ClU11pbell. a sel f.<Jescribed "new

wrong places. He says he would spend 
more money on teachers and materi-

In this way. the teacher-t~pupil mtio

Bono had hoped to capitalize on 
the phi Iosophical differences between 
the other two candidates. but irlSteaci 
finds himself fUlUling a distant third. 

Bono is essential Iy running an anti-
waste campaign. If unnecessary costs 
are taken out of government, health 
care and education. then everything 
else will fall into place. 

For example. he favors cutting 
govelTUT1ent departments by lOper-
cent to lower the federal budgel. He 
also would support a balanced budget 
amendment and a lirle item veto. 

The Republican contest for the 
long-tenn seat boils down to a choice 
between the conservative philosophy 
of HerscherlSOhn and the more mod-

Short-Term s..t 

When Pete Wilson was elected 
governor in 1990. he appointed John 
Seymour to fill his position in the 
senate until the next election year. The 
lucky winner of this seat gets to begin

The front-runner right now is 
Dianne Feinstein, the fOffilerSan Fran-
cisco mayor and gubernatorial candi-
date. Like Boxer. she is anempting to 
capitalize on herconcem for the needs 
of women voters. Unlike Boxer, 
Feinstein only developed this concern 
recently.

erate Democrat who was relatively 
friendly toward business, and hercarn-

paign Slances do not contradict thi 
position. She believes in ecol1Ol1lic 
incentives for job creation, fair trdde 
and cutting taxes for the middle class. 
Feinstein also positions herself as a 
conservationist and a proponent of 
uni ven;ai health care. 

What Fein.stein does not I1lention 
is the dire fiscal stmits she left the city 
of San Francisco in at the end of her 
nine years as mayor. A lawsuit has 
also been filed against Feinstein for 
al legedly failing to report cmnpaign 
dOflationsduring ller 1990 gubemato-
rial cmnpaign. 

California State Controller Gmy 
Davis luIS attempted to position him-
self as a more liberal candidate than 
Fein lein. challenging her commit-

111e UCSD Guardian 

mem to women ' s issues. 
Davis is relying heavily upon his 

record as controller. as a t w~tenn 
:.l'i.scmblymW1 and as fonner chief of 
staff to Governor Jerry Brown. 

Throughout his career, Davis has 
supported legislation that is pro-choice 
andpro-envifOlU11enL VOIerscanprob-
ably expect more of the sallle if he is 
elected senator. Hi position papers 
also stress his support of gays .uld 
lesbians and hi ' commitnlenllO pro-
I mel legislation. 

Joseph Alioto, a San Francisco 
anti-trust attolney. is the third Demo-
cmtic candidate for the tw~year sen-
ate seat. MlUlY of Alioto's positi0l1S 
are rooted in his anti-trust philosophy. 
He believes the current "ecollOmic 
emergency" is due to a lack of ec~ 
nomiccompetitionencour.lged by tile 
I", t two presidential admini trJtions. 

To that end, Alioto would encour-
age economic growth by stopping 
mergers between major competitors.

In the final weeks before the pri-

sive campaign against Feinstein. not-

This II th-houroffensive will prob-

upon how voters feel about Feinstein 's

RepI ..... Contntlelwl'lld ..... ,. .. 

Like the mce between Cmnpbell 
and Herschensohn, this r.ICe is shap-
ing up to be another clash between 
moderate and conservative philoso-
phies. Only for this seat, the moderate 
candidate is facing two hard-corc con-
servative opponents. 

l11e modemte is John Seymour, 
the current incwnbent. How high is 
anti-incumbent sentiment this year? 
In his initial TV ads. Seymourdoes 110t 
even lnention the fact that he's cur-
rently a senator. 

Scmlch John Seymour and you' lI 
find the SUI1le political positions you 
see in Pete Wilson. Seymour is. to a 
certain extent. a pro-choice Republi-
can who opposes off-sllOre oil drill-
ing. 

He believes environl1lCntal con-
cerns should be balanced with eco-
nomic concems. The key to balancing 
the budget. Seymour argues. is to re-
duce federal spending. 

The common perception about 
Seyrnouri~thathe's~ntially;.rclone 
of Wilson (this perception ha~;.r great 
deal of truth in it. actually . . . ). 

It was believed that Republican 
discontent with Wilson would tmns-

Seymour. 111at would be true. if not

Hail to 
The Chief? 
By Pet er Ko 
Senior Staff Writer 

Pt'DST ALLOFTHE I-ROO NUMBERS. Wllid~t all of the accu~ations of anti-semitism .md infidelity wlCf <unidst all of 
the broken promises. one theme has emerged to 
domin,lIe the 1992 presidential mce: the need for 
domestic refonn. Any cmJdidate wonh his weight 
in votes 11:15 jumped on the b.1I1dwagon. 1be lines 
might as well have been spewed OUI by a Xerox 
machine: The country is in dire slraits. they say. 

1he nation'. 
disgust Is 
such that 

little over a

President

We need to cut through 
the bureaucr.Jtic mess mJd 
get back 10 the people. 

Indeed. the o;uion's 
disgust is such thaI lin Ie 
over a year after President 
Bush's approval rating 
had skyrocketed into the 
75th percentile. he finds 
himself wilh a hair-Ihin 
lead in the polls over an 
runbiguous Texas 
billionaire who has yet to 
fOlmally declare his 
cmJdidacy. Forthe 
ultimate indiC".Itor of the 
stale of lhe American 
poliliC".ll system. however, 
one need look no further 
tl1.111 the names on the 
ballot. As the race hits 
Cal ifomia, Ihree "out-
sider" candidates mnain 
- and all are expected, 
for bener or worse, to 
have some affect on the 
flnal ouK·ome. 

Gl.'orgl.' Bllslt is the 
incumbent. Atlhis point, 
lhafs about all he has 
going for hirn His 
campaign can'l seem 10 
make a right move in a 
dead-end alley. The 
lingering sourJdbile from 
his 1988 caJ11paign. 
"Read my lips. No new 
taxes," was rescinded in 
1990 when he compro-
mised as part of a budget 
deal. BUllWo months ago, 
Bush denounced the 
cOll1promise as the 
biggest mistake of his 
presidency. The impres-

sion thaI is left is of a president who isn'l sure 
aboul what he wanls to do, or how he wants 10 do 
it. 

1be latest black man., however. canle earlier 
this monlh when lhe verdict in the Rodney King 
ca.<;e was handed down. 1be riots and violence 
which followed only served as a reminder that the 
country is in lousy shape domestically. For all of 
Bush's successes in foreign policy. he is left 
grasping at empry air when it comes to domestic 
triumphs. 

Almost as a result of being bullied into doing 
so, Bush h:1S made domestic refonn a central issue 
of his re-election crunpaign. 1be main feature is 
his so-<:alled "weed rulel seed" progr.un. Firsl, 
weed crime out of bad neighbortJoods mJd provide 
greater suppon for law enforcenlent. then seed tile 
areas with hope for a better future. Despile the 
ridicule Bush's WI buddy Dan Quayle took for 
blaming the declirle in Americrul values on 
Murphy Brown. tile Bush administration contin-
ues to emphasize fmnily values. Bush advocates 
effol1s to increase home ownership, mJd he is a 
strong proponent of welfare refonn. As part of 
pro-investment efforts, Bush hilS advocated 
"enterprise zones," or changing the tax slructure 
mJd environnlental regulations 10 jump slart the 
development of industries in depressed areas, so as 
to provide more jobs. 

However. aside from the question of whether 
all this weedin' lUld seedin' is a practical solution 
to the nation's domestic problems. there's also the 
question that should be on everyone's mind: 
"Okay, George, if you 've h,Jd this great plan on 
the backbumer all this time. why haven't you put 
it to WOIi<; yet? Or is this a reelection thing?" 

Along with the domestic condition of lhe U.S., 
Bush's Olhermajor black mrui<; has been the stale 
oflhe economy. The projected deficit for this year 
is $400 billion (up from a Iinle over$l50 billion

OPINION 04/ 05 

Improving cautomla Colleges? 
Proposition 153 - also known as the "Higher 

Education Focility Bond Act of June 1992" - would 
authorize the state to sell $900 million in bonds to fund 
the construction or it'r(lrovement of California's pOOIic 
college and lJ'liversity focilrties. The UC. California State 
University. and California Corrmunity College systems 
would all benefit if voters pass the measure. 
AIOments tor Prop. 153 

Proponents of the bond initiClive say th<l overcrowded 
dassrooms. antiquated facilities and deteriorati~ 

buildi~ tlTeaten the state's ability to offer quality. 
affordabfe higher education. Pa:ordi~ to californians for 
Hig/)er Edu:OOon, the group most active~ promoti~ the 
initiative, Prop. 153 will hcNe rrmy beneficial effects: 

• It will allow for Il1lJCh.needed rencNations and repairs. 
• It will create upwards of 13.000 jobs immediately in 

capital outlay prqects. 
• It will help 5p\X economic re«Nerf by generatirt up 

to $2 billion in new economic activities. 
• It will help the state remain COfl'4JetitiYe. Sixty-live 

percent of the new jobs created in California i1 the next 
fiIIe yeas will require some college education. The 
argument is that without adequate focilities, colleges and 
lXIiYersitieS will be forced to tllTl aNCfoJ qualified students. 

• The benefits will outweillr1 art costs. College-
educated people will contribute more than enough to the 
economy to offset the costs of pCfoji~ off the bonds when 
they come to term. 
Aroments apInst Prop. 153 

Opponents say that. given the current crisis in higher 
education Mdirg. alditional focilities won't mean 

anythi~ if lJ'liversities are forced to cut enrollment. They 
reason that the initiative is merely an exercise i1 deferred 
gratificcb>n. Some arguments against Prop.153 include: 

• Bonds are not "free money: Taxpayers will 
ultinately haye to foot the bill for these bonds when their 
owners come to collect. Therefore. califomiMS will be 
forced to pay back the $900 milion. plus about $700 
minion in interest 

• People \\00 receive a college ~ and find 
~rt as a result of graduai~ from a California 
university 0\.4lt1t to pay the cost of that education 
themselves. Forci~ sil'€le people, the elderly. and 
childless couples to foot the bill is wrorg. 

• UnWersities are cuttil'€ ~ts, ~ off instructors 
and eliminating a::a:Iemic programs. If Prop. 153's bonds 
are used to build new focilities, opponents ask, will taxes 
then be raised to fill them with instructors and erucationaI 
programs? 
How UCSO wi! benefit 

If Proposition 153 is approved, money is already slated 
for various projects on CCJITC)US. ~

DESPERATE TIMES CALL FOR 
DESPERATE MEASURES LIKE 
LOOKING TO POLmCIANS FOR HELP 
By Ben Boychuk, Opinion Editor 

B EAFRAID. BE VERY AFRAID. FEES ARE rising, budgels are falling. classes are shrinking mJd instructors - indeed. entire departlTlent~­
are beginning to disappear. What is happening to San 
Diego State University arlel other Cal State schools 
could just as easily happen to the University of 
California. There jusl isn't enough money to go 
around. In the lilSt five years, students have found 
themselves paying more mJd gening less. 

The crisis in education in general. mld higher 
education in panicular. is very real. Some 36 stmes are 
facing serious budget crises, ruld 30 of them are 
slashing higher education budgets significantly to help 
make ends meet. Here in California, Govemor Pete 
Wilson has suggested Ihat lhe UC ruld several olher 
state-subsidized programs could face across-the-borutJ 
cuts mnging mlywhere from 17 to 30 percent. Accord-
ing to Lee Bunemeld, executive director of the 
University of CnJifomia Student Association (UCSA). 
"a 17-percenl cut is equivalent to the operating budget 
of a large UC campus like UC Davis," 

Understrulding the gravilY of the predican1<:nt -
ruld knowing that th is is rul election year - pmlicked 
students have turned to politiciruls for some much 
needed answers. And. for bener or for worse. the 
politicirulS have given them. 

College student" represent pelhaps the largest 
untapped constituency in the state. if not the nation. 
Nearly two million students are enrolled in the 138 
campuses which comprise Califomia's extensive 
higher education system. There are nearly 200.000 
students in the UC alone. According to the United 
Slates Student Associalion (USSA). however, only 36 
percent of 18-24 year olds voted in 1988. 

College 
students 
r'epresent 

perhaps the 
largest 

untapped 
constituency 
in the state, 
with nearty 
two million 

eligible 
voters. But 

in 1988, only 
36 percent of 

1~24year 
oldsvoted. 

A survey of the major presidential cmJdidates 
conducted by the USSA yielded 5OI1le mtller 
predictable responses -lUld in some cases, no 
response at all. Democmtic C'&Jdi<late Larry Agran 
mJd Republicans Pat Buchanrul and David Duke 
didn'l even bother to reply. To the surprise of none, 
lhe Democratic cruldidates - Jerry Brown and Bill 
Clinton - supported greater fedeml spending in 
highereducalion. George Bush. the self-proclaimed 
education president. didn't ,Ulswer several of the 
questions. including those which asked whether he 
would increase, decrease or maintain federal 
spending in higher education. 

Some responses were typically vague and 
unenlightening. Asked what role 11<: sees the fedeml 
govemn1<:nt playing in higher education. Jerry 
Brown responded "a critical role to provide 
leadership. funding. mJd programs 10 improve 
higher education:' Indeed. Bush didn't answer six 
out of the II queslions asked. CI inton spoke at 
length about his "domestic GI bill" - es.<;enlially a 
voluntary national service progranl- which would 
provide financial aid to mlyone who asks for it (to 
be fair, Clinton was the most specific oflhe 
respondents). 

Brown wants massive increases in federal 
scholarship funding. He wants to raise the maxi-
mum PeLi Grant 10 $4,500. He is also strongly 
critical of the bureaucracy wh ich burdens the 
universities. "Before cutting classes," Brown said in 
a speech delivered at UCSD two weeks ago. "they 
should cut the administration." 

Bush supports adequate funding for Pell Grants, 
but does not believe they should be entitlements. 

Student lobby groups have been at a construll disadvantage in the 
pol itical arena. It 's di fficult for pol iticians to take ~tudent interests 
seriously if they know a vilSt majority of tl1<:m don't vote. But, in rul 
eleclion year especially. it's better to be safe than sorry. Should 
students suddenly decide to lUsh to the polls, the candidates must be 
ready. 

Clinton says that, under his domestic GI bill scheme, Pell Grants 
would essenlially become entitlements - but 11<: won't admit it. 

The question of minolity scholarship funding is divided along 
p,uty lines. Bush invokes lhe Civil Rights Act of 1964 as his 
justification for opposing race-based scholarships. Pat Buchrulml 
has been a rigid mJd outspoken opponent of affinnative action mJd 
preferential treatment throughout his political career. He wants 

• 

amtJlt 
• federal loans mJd granls 10 be awarded solely on merit. 

Brown, on the other hand, wants to see a "major increa-;e" in 
scholarship funding. Ointon once again calls anentiolllo his 
domestic GI bi ll , which he says will provide much needed 
opportunities to minori ties and poor students. 

Trying 10 pin down the conlenders for U.S. Senate on lhe 
question of higher education is much more difficult. "Educalion is 
ml important resource" is a refrain that is repeated over w1d over 
again by Republicans and Democrats alike. BUI mo~l are 
concerned with prim.uy and secondary educalion - a noble 
pursuit. to be sure, but not panicularly helpful for college student~ 
looking for an assur.ll1Ce that they can still expect qual iry. 
affordable education. 

There are some clues, however. Leo McCarthy, who is 
running against Barbara Boxer mJd Mel Levine for Alrul 
Cr.ulston's seat on the Democratic side, has been frequently 
supportive of student interests whi Ie acling as rull.'x-officio 
member of the UC Regents. 

1be biggest issues concerning all of the candidates-
presidential mJd senatorial- are choice for public mJd private 
schools and funding for the Head Start program. All four 
pres.idential carJdidates support Head Slart to some extent; Brown 
and Clinton pledge full funding within their first year in office. 

1be Republ icruls support increased conlrol of educational 
policy on a local and district level. Buchanan mJd Bush both 
advocate a voucher system which would refund education tax 
money to parents who serlCf thei r children to privale schools. Bush 
supports tax write-offs for interest payments on student loans. 

The Democrats tend to back vocational programs which 
would train minorities and the economically disadvantaged for 
jobs Ihal pay more than just minimum wage. Brown, for exan1ple. 
Wmlts to see gre.1ler involvement from the business cOll1munity in 
these tmining progmms. Clinton. again points toward his 
donnestic GI bill. 

In Califomia, the fear mJd uncertainty about the future of 
higher education persist. In Sacramento, lhe policy makers are 
preparing for the worst. Califomia's long-strulding policy of 
"higher education for all" is in a gr-eat deal of jeopardy. Maureen 
DiMarco, secretary for child development lUld education under 
Wilson. said in rul interview in the December issue of the 
Cali/omia 10llmal that refol111S geared toward improving 
elementary and secondary educalion could "collapse the higher 
education system because we'lI produce more high school 
graduates and there won't be any room on crunpuses for them." 

With the primruy just a day away, mrulY students will be asked 
to make some impol1ant decisions concerning who to vote for in 
the fall election. Tomonuw, they will have the opportunity to 
sepamte the chaff from the wheat. In lhe area of higher education, 
there isn't much to go on. Puning one's faith in a politician to 
serve the public interesl is difficult. The critical thing to do. then, 
is to demonstrate that students care aboutth~.e issues. Hopefully. 
some of the fear students feel today will tmnsmit to lhe politicians 
in SacfaJ11ento mJd Washington lomonuw. 



06 OPINION 

Chief: 
ContInued from page 02 
when he was elected in 1988). and 
there have been rumblings that the tax 
burden in recent year.> has fallen on the 
middle class. Bush. as before,opposes 
any new taxes and supportS a capiraJ 
gains tax cut to induce investment and 
growth. He has also proposed cuning 
246 government programs and re-
forms thai would reduce entitlement 
spending by nearly $35 billion in five 
years,as well ascutting milirruy spend-
ing and force by 33 percent in seven 
yean;. 

Bush has also said that he favors 
"fair" rrnde rules (as opposed to unfair 
tmde rules), and lately, he's been buck-
ing for tile Nonh American Free Trade 
Agreement, which would create tar-
i ff-free tmde with Mex iconOO Crul3da.

argues. incidents such as the LA. riots 
are symptomatic of a larger evil -
seen in pomogmphy. movies. rock

families - which has taken over the 
U.S.

he said: "Can anyone believe this Lost 
Gener.uion. steeped in drugs. crime. 
immorality and hale. is going to be 
converted to decency by an offer of

What Buchanan advocates is 
reinstilling the teachings of the Old

of Western Civilizarion and recapture 
the "soul of America." To which one 
mighl pose Pat' own question: "Can 
anyone believe lhe Crips and the

Along lhe lines of his "America

Bill Climoll is the leading candi-

date for the democralic nomination. 
By most accounts, he feels his biggest 
qual ificru ion forthejobis tilat he's not 
George Bush. 

In a speech in Alabama, Dinton 
noted that President Reagan once said 
the test of a president's re-election 
c:unjXlign is: Are you bener off than 
you were fouryears ago? Said Dinton: 
"Well. if that 's the test, George Bush 
cannQ( be reelected." 

Yes, Bill, but why should we elect 
you? 

Slick Willie has made edUCalion 
and economic recovery the corner-
stones of his campaign bid. He pr0-
poses doubling education spending. 
fuji funding of the Head Start pro-
gmm, vocational apprenticeship pro-
gr.uns for those who do not anend 
college and adult edUCalion for non-
high school gr.iduates. The idea is 
fine: tIlequestion is practicality. Where 
will all the money come from? 

Economically, Dinton has pro-
posed cutting middle class taxes and 
rai ing taxes for the upper class - a 
move which may be politically wise. 
but economically amounts to squat. 
He has also advOCaled a 50 percent 
capital gains tax cut He has been

Ross Perot, Bush's '88 campaign was 
a Boeing 747 with a space shuttle on 
top. 

The Texas multi billionaire is the

he's literally being drafted - albeit 
very willingly - for the presidency.

candidate. " I want to do it well." he 
said. But there isa sneaking suspicion 
thai what he actually meallS is, "I'm 
nOl sure what my beliefs are." 

What is known i that Perot is a big

the Navy because hedidn 'I agree with

clared Ihat. if he were president. he 
would confront the drug war head on.

Just last week. he went on record as 
saying that he would not hire homo-
