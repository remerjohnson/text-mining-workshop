Everything You 
Wanted To 
Know About ...

Staff Writer 

Have a problem or question 
about human sexuality? If you are 
reluctant to write to the Playboy 
advisor, try dropping by the UCSD 
Sex Clinic where professional 
advice is now being given to all 
UCSD students and their spouses 
who are interested in learning 
about current developments in 
sexual therapy and/or are seeking 
treatment for individual problems. 

Dr. Hugh Pates who directs the 
clinic, has a Ph.D. in counseling 
psychology, and attended the 
seminar training of Masters and 
Jotmson. Working with him are two 
women, Dulynn Profit and Laum 
Kuhn, who are working on their 
Masters in social work. 

The "Night.Rider . .. a free shuttle bus in its second week of operation , has receiued only a scant response thus far . But 
the bus is still running its campus route nightly Mondays through Thursday [Triton Times, April4J .

"The most frequent sexual 
problem with males," Pates said, 
" is premature ejaculation and then 
secondary impotence" (inability to 
sustain an erection during in-
tercourse). For females the most 
frequent problem is "the inability 
to reach an orgasm during 
heterosexual intercourse, " he 
added. 

After three and a half years of 
existence the clinic has an 85 
percent cure rate of its cases (26 
cases this last Fall and Winter 
quarter). In the treatment of 
problems Pates commented that 
he prefers to "work with the couple 
concerned rather than just the one 
individual." The clinic also has an 
outreach service, from which 
groups (dorms, clubs) can obtain a 
discussion leader to help answer 
questions and clarify points on 
sexual matters. 

Pates hopes that students with 
sexual problems will not feel

At 11 pm I sit in a neuroscience 
lab at the medical school. I'm in 
my pajamas. Two researchers are 
gluing about 12 electrodes to my 
scalp. Before crawling into the bed 
surrounded by softly whirring 
computers and elec-
troencephalographs I look into the 
mirror. Wires hang from my head 
medusa-like. At least it will be a 
quiet night's sleep away from the 
dorm. I recline on the portable bed 
and sleep almost immediately. The 
next morning I wake up at nine and 
yell "HELP!" uam student and 
assistant Larry Reid takes the 
electrodes out of my scalp. 

Brain Wave investigation 
The study of hwnan brain im-

pulses during sleep is just one of 
the many parts of an investigation 
now being conducted hete on brain 
waves. The investigation is based 
on theoretical models of brain

impulses and has two main ob-
jectives: to discover physiological 
bases for brain waves and to 
determine whether or not brain 
waves are waves as in the physical 
sciences, such as ocean or seismic 
waves. 

"Frequency - Wavenumber 
Spectral Analysis of Elec-
troencephalogram (EEG)" is the 
name of the National Science 
Foundation (NSF) grant that is 
funding the project Dr. Paul 
Nunez, Asst. Research 
Neuroscientist, has been working 
on for a year and a half. 

For the experiments, an ele~ 
troencephalograph, a machine that 
measures brain activity is used. 
The term " EEG" is often used 
synonymously for " brain waves," 
Nunez noted, saying that it records 
brain impulses. 

Electrodes are placed on the 
scalp quickly and painlessly. No 
hair is removed and no " holes" are 
made in the head. One merely has 

to wash the small amount of glue 
out of one's hair when the ex-

perim~nt is finished. 
All Night EEG Vigil 

For the "sleep study" the 
electroencephalograph measures 
"delta rhytlun," a frequency of 
EEG occurring when one sleeps. 
An assistant stays up until 4 am 
monitoring the equipment. In 
addition to electrodes in the scalp, 
electrodes are placed near the eyes 
to measure eye movement during 
the night. 

Currently Nunez is conducting 
EEG studies on persons under 
anesthesia, and in the future plans 
to do · more and varied sleep 
studies. 

Volunteers for the experiments 
are UCSD students and members 
of the community. So far 159 have 
had their alpha waves recorded. 
Three have slept at the lab, and 10 
have been tested under anesthesia.

Many Students Could Be Eating Better 
by Helaine Lasky 

(CPS)-here is no such thing as a well-fed student. Four years of 
dorm food and spaghetti dinners, not to mention what students eat (or 
do not eat) during exam weeks, are enough to make one graduate 
early. 

The government food stamp program exists as a $5.4 billion way out, 
but statistics from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) indicate 
that eligible students are not taking advantage of the program. Out of a 
national caseload of 17.3 million, roughly 1.3 percent or 2-300,000 
students are food stamp recipients. Students must meet the same 
requirements as other applicants with two exceptions: they are not 
eligible if they are claimed as dependents by their parents if their 
parents do not qualify for food stampsj and students are not forced to 
register for work. The maximum income prerequisite which ought to 
meet most student living situations head-on if they are paying their 
way, is $245 per month after taxes. 

How to Get Stam .. 
Considering the limited amount of time a student can spend working 

and the limited income, it would be logical to expect more students to 
apply for the grocery-buying aid than already do. The procedure is not 
very complicated although the investigations and regular interviews 
may be a hassle students choose not to deal with. Normally, one is 
required to make an appointment with a food stamp program officer 
and supply all check stubs, receipts for school, tuition, books and 
educational expenses, rent and utility bills and medical payments. 
Any savings account must also be reported. Scholarships are con-
sidered income and distributed over the period it is meant to serve, 
usually the academic year. 

Unlike student loans, the food stamp prOiram has not experienced 
any subltantial fraud on the part of students. A spot_woman at the 
Food Stamp Division of the USDA in WalblnltOn, D.C. said abe WII 
not aware of any abuse in the program. A study conduded by the 

General Accounting Office (GAO) in May, 1976, concluded that most 
students who requested food stamps were in fact, poor students who 
needed the coupons. The GAO sampled San Francisco State Univer-
sity, the University of Tampa, University of Wisconsin, University of 
PeMsylvania, North Texas State University and University of Por-
tland. Students at both public and private schools are considered 
equally, although students at public schools are expected to have less 
money. 

Most Live Alone 
The study further showed that more graduate students benefited 

from the food stamp program than did undergraduates and, " un-
predictably," two-thirds of the stamp recipients claimed to be single 
member households, an official way of saying they lived alone. 

If there is any fraud in the food stamp program, it may be because of 
food stamp vendors who are not properly accounting for the cash and 
food coupons in their charge. In 1975, Congress passed the Emergency 
Food Stamp Vendor Accountability Act to prevent this from hap-
pening. This year, the Senate has introduced even more radical 
reform into the existing program. 

The Dole-McGovern Food Stamp Bill (S.845) is attempting to in-
stitute changes into the program, which expires Sept. 30. One major 
push is to eliminate the purchase requirement, a move that a Senate 
committee previously failed to recommend. The purchase 
requirement is a system in which the family must pa for the stamps. 

An Example 
Example : Mr. or Mrs. Smith has a family offourand a net income of 

$350 per month. Smith pays $95 a month for ,166 in food stamps. The 
benefit then, is $71. Eliminating the purchase ~quirement would 
Simply provide the food stamp recipient with the $71 in food stamps. 

Students tryinC to make ends meet with part-time jobs or some other 
meager income l1li)' qualify for the food stamp program and should 
inquire about eligibility. 

Dean Charged 
With Misuse 
Reg Fees 

by Laura Richter 
Staff Writer 

Vice-chancellor and Dean of 
Student Affairs George Murphy 
has been charged with inefficient 
use of Registration Fee money, 
which has allegedly led to the $20 
quarterly increase for the 1977-78 
school year. 

Bert Lee , member of the 
Advisory Committee on Student 
Fee Programs, stated that Murphy 
was "not trying to keep the fee 
levels lower, as promised." Lee 
told of a $100,000 (two percent of 
the total Student Affairs budget) 
cut-back agreement made between 
the committee and Murphy as a 
stipulation for their approval of an 
addition to the base increase in 
Reg. Fees. Murphy, according to 
Lee, reportedly agreed to "ac-
tively try to reassess the Student 
Mfairs division, in general, to 
identify waste, and to make the 
division more efficient finan-
cially." Lee noted that, " If we 
could do ~his, we could make the 
fee levels lower in the future by 
reallocating funds within the 
budget." 

In July, 1976, the UC Board of 
Regents voted to raise the existing 
$300 Reg. fee to $348, annually, 
leaving the Chancellors of the 
individual campuses with the 
option of raising that amount by a 
maximum addition of up to $45 a 
year. 

Richard Whitehill, Assistant 
Vice-chancellor of Student Affairs 
and member of the advisory 
committee denied Lee's authority 
to speak on behalf of committee 
members, saying that "Bert is 
definitely not a spokesman for the 
committee," and that " if he is 
speaking for the rest of the com-
mittee, the committee will break 
both his arms ... metaphorically." 

Whitehill referred to a $100,000 
cut-back as " necessary" in order 
to prevent a quarterly increase of 
$24, as opposed to $20, saying that 
the cut came from a combination 
of different contigencies on the one 
hand, and a base program on the 
other hand." He pointed out that 
" committee advice has been made 
quite clear in the minutes," and 
stated that the $100,000 to which 
Lee referred was "additional and 
not agreed upon by the Vice-
chance \lor. " 

"No Ne d for Increase" 
Lee insisted that " there is no 

quantifiable need for the in-
crease," saying that it was "partly 
the fault of the students, who have 
not mad it known that they do not 
want Reg. Fees to go up." He 
stated that Mw-phy's fault lay in 
the hiring of " uperfluous per-
sonnel" adding that " th re are 
personnel who we have been able 
to idenl ify in the Student Affairs 
taff, WllO do nothing, and who are 

not n c.'ed." He saw it necessary 
that "\00 fat be cut away and the 
available re ources ef-
fi . "' lIt !;--! • fro me

" We can't come Iij) with cuts," 
said Whitehill . " To detenniJ e the 
budget for next year, we had to 
consider all possible contigenci , 
such as utilities and health care." 
In considering Lee's reference to 
an additional cut in penditures,

Ge US Out of South Africa Now 
11Je Nationol Student Coalition 

Against Raci~1I1l is a natlonwide 
organization dedicated to fighting 
racial opposi' on through mass 
action. One of its chief objectives is 
to force the US, by means of 
nationally organized collective 
action, to withdraw all forms of 
support from the racist minority 
regime in South Africa. 

To further this goal, SCAR is 
organizing a picket line for 
Saturday, April 1 at 12 noon in 
Newport Beach. At that time, a 
whites-only South African tennis 
team will be playing in an in-
ternational tournament. SCAR 
sees this tournament as a 
recognition and legitimization of 
apartheid in South Africa. 

Those who are interested contact 
SCAR, P .O. Box 381, San Diego 
92101 (or call 232-5898 or 452-9318). 

In the past, NSCAR's united 

front policy has produced a 
March ~26 nationwide rally to 
show opposition to US support of 
the South African regime. In San 
Diego there was a picket line in 
front of the San Diego Federal 
Building ' in which 125 people 
participated. 

Another example of NSCAR's 
efforts to stop US support of South 
Africa, was the touring of Tsietsi 
Mashinini, the South African 
student who led the June 1976 
Soweto uprising. 

Mashinini gave an eyewitness 
account of the reign of terror in-
stituted by the minority regime 
against South Africans who would 
support the struggle against 
apartheid, in front of an audience 
of 650 at San Diego State. 

How can the United States, the 
self-proclaimed defender of global 
morality, directly or indirectly

What Does 
Schneider 
Stand For? 

When Andy Schneider an-
nolUlCed that he was running for 
ASUCSD President (Triton Times, 
March 18,) he made an amazing 
claim. He said that he had no 
commitment to any political 
ideology. 

I am puzzled as to why anyone 
would consider this a virtue, 
especially in a politician. A person 
who has no principles cannot be 
trusted or held accountable by the 
electorate. His decisions will be 
guided by expedience rather than 
conscience, and they will show no 
consistency from day to day. 

A political leader must have a 
well known set of beliefs combined 
with a readiness to carefully weigh 
constructive criticism. He must be 
elected by a majority who expects 
those beliefs to guide his actions. 
The remainder of the electorate 
must balance the governing 
process by reasoned challenged of 
these beliefs and criticism of

hesitate to think what kind of 
government would result. Suppose, 
for example, that the group 
surrounding him decided that it 
was undesirable to have certain 
groups on campus. According to 
his statements, he would go off 
crusading to get them what they 
wanted. 

What, precisely, does Schneider 
stand for? Unless he tells us, we 
can only conclude that he wants 
power for his own selfish reasons. 
Unless he tells us, he is not the 
person we want to lead the 
ASUCSD into its crucial first year. 
Unless he tells us, we would be 
foolish to vote for him.

The Headless Monster and Big Business 

It is as we have always feared. The University is a headless monster. 
Not a monster tha~ writhes aimlessly, striking out with blind tentacles. 

But a machine without a unifying brain moving ceaselessly onward, 
doing its tasks mechanically and somewhat efficiently. 

Let me explain. 
Chancellor McElroy is in Saudi Arabia. He's there to lecture this 

weekend to engineering students at the University of Petrolewn and 
Minerals. He's going to explain the importance of research and pre-
secondary education on this trip, sponsored by the Arab-American 
Corporate Oil Conglomerate, better known as ARAMOO. 

Assistant Chancellor Dave Ryer, who serves as McElroy's gadfly, his 
eyes on campus, is in South Africa. He's part of a study team, organJzed 
by the state department, sent there to examine the possibility of bringing 
black students to universities here on an exchange program - although I 
don't know how many American students would want to study in South 
Africa. 

-Vice-chancellor Paul Salbnan, who is supposed to replace McElroy as 
campus head when the Chancellor takes off (a commoo occurence,) is 
also out of town. Earlier this week he was in Harriman, New York, at the 
Third International Conference on the Proteins of Iron Storage and 
Transport (hope I got that straight). Then, yesterday, he was lecturing 00 
biology and contemporary society at Southeastern University in Ham-
mond, Louisiana. 

An international campus, you say. 
But then, who's running the campus? 
Good question. According ·to the official line of succession, medical 

school dean John Moxley. If Moxley were to decide a liWe travelling 
would fit well with him, Scripps Institution of Oceanography director 
William Nierenberg would ascend. 

And so the path goes. But what does it all prove? Simply this: the 
University, like any bureaucracy, can function indefinitely, as long 81 
nothing " unusual" happens. There are enough vice-chancellors and 
deans here to take care of most problems that might flare up. Only under 
stressful situations does the monster need a head. 

Now, this might be a tribute to McElroy's abilities to delegate power to 
capable people. Or it might just mean there are enough small chiefs here 
that there's one for almost every problem. 

Of course, as in any bureaucracy, day-to-day operations tend naturally 
toward entropy, until finally there is a crisis. This is the only situation in 
which anyone can effect real change in a bureaucracy. And it takes a 
decisive leader to cause that change to occur. 

••••• 

But, what about the significance of Ryer and McElroy's trips? Ryer's 
participation in a government-sponsored trip to the racist country of 
South Africa has already evoked outrage from several quarter'S of the 
campus. After all, for what it's worth in official circles, students votine on 
last quarter's referendmn advised that UC cut all ties with South Africa. 

News of McElroy's trip to Saudi Arabia, as it is SPOD.1Ored by a hugeoU 
conglomerate like ARAMCO, should cause a similar resporiie, altbouch 
racism is a more emotional issue than mulltnational corporatioDl. 

The responses of those defending McElroy and Ryer are predictable. 
The two men are doing these things in the name of hi&her education, and 
so are doing good things. The trips are not sponsored by UC and so do not 
involve the University anyway. No politics are involved. 

This, though, is a grotesquely narrow view of the situation and these 
administrators and their defenders, being intelligent people, surely know 
this. They just retreat to an ~political stance whenever it ls convenient. 

But politics and academia cannot be separated, as we alileamed from 
the sixties with its hassles over campus weapons research, military 
recruitment, CIA presence on campus, and many other controversies. 
McElroy's trip might be sponsored by ARAMCO, not by UC; that doesn't 
make it any less politically symbolic. 

Why were McElroy and Ryer selected, out of all the American Scholan

Black Sunday: 
Action Packed 
Entertainment 

by Mark Stadler 

The Palestinian Liberation Organization members 
in the new movie Black Sunday certainly knew 
America well. In their desire to show the American 
people they (the terrorists) mean business, the 
terrorists decide they will drop a bomb filled with 
300,000 rifle darts on the Super Bowl game. They 
surely must have picked this ev~nt, above all others, 
because they knew it is the one thing - the only thing? 
- that wiD never be cancelled. 

Even when the authorities discover the terrorists 
are aiming for the Super Bowl, football officials 
refused to cancel the game. "C~l the Super Bowl? 
Why, that'd be like calling off Christmas," one of-
ficial tells an exasperated Israeli conunando. 

It is the Super Bowl and its fans which provide a 
strong parallel to the most exciting portion of the 
film: the desperate struggle by the Israeli commando 
Kabakov (Robert Shaw) and FBI agent (Fritz 
Weaver) in a helicopter to stop the Goodyear blimp, 
anned with the bomb, aimed for the Super Bowl. 

Frankenheimer cuts his cameras continually from 
the helicopterlblimp duel to the football game; from 
ex-POW Lander (Bruce Oem) - who is helping the 
terrorists - shooting the blimp's navigator to the 
quaterback getting sacked; from terrorist master-
mind Dahlia Iyad (Marthe Keller) spraying the 
blimp's crew with machine fire to a touchdown 
played. 

AU this served to reinforce what mayor may not 
have been a conscious effort on Frankenheimer's 
part. 

As the blimp draws nearer to the Super Bowl and its 
unsuspecting 8O,~lus spectators, it is easy to get 
caught up in the chase, but only for the chase's sake. 
There is little sense of anxiety for the fans and 
players. even as the bomb is drawn away to explode 
harmlessly (unless you're a fish over the water. The 
fans are only a mass of screams and colors which is 
only to be observed. The chase is rather appreciated

Robert S haw defends his cause in Black Sunday. 
as it is between individuals. between Shaw and 
Weaver ; Keller and Oem. 

This sense of individual conflict is the key to Black 
Sunday's strength. The film is filled with individual 
struggles between well-defined individuals. 

Shaw is the standout, as a war-weary commando. 
He is known in Israeli government circles as the 
"final solution." and is tired of his life. He has fought 
for 30 years and nothing has changed, he muses at one 
point. 

Keller is his direct opponent, a strong woman who 
masterminds the plot. (Her one problem is that she 
has too many SCenes of shocked amazement, in which 
she resembles Mary Pickford playing a silent 
melodrama. ) Still, she plays competently. "She's 
your creation," an Arab colonel tells Shaw, referring 
to her background as a Palestinian refugee whose 
family was uprooted by the creation of Israel. 

Oem. as the naval officer who aids Keller, is also a 
creation of the times. He was a POW who made a 
propaganda film for the Vietnamese, a much-
decorated officer who was dishonorably discharged. 
He plays yet another psychotic, and plays him well, 
screaming and violent then gentle and mild, coldly 
competent yet caught up in the power of the bomb. 

Black Sunday is not a film for someone looking for a 
political statement. Both sides in the conflict are 
examined dispassionately, and only as they relate to 
the plot. The underlying reasons for the IsraelilPLO 
struggle are not fare for a high budget, entertainment 
film. And Black Sunday is just that, a solid and en-
tertaining movie.
