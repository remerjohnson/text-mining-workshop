UC may lose Los Alamos contract 
Dept. of Energy reports mismanagement 

By GAELLf FAURE 
Associate News Editor 

The University of California's 
contract to manage Los Alamos 
National Laboratory runs the risk 
of being terminated after recent 
mismanagement scandals that have 
been brought to light in a U .S. 
Department of Energy report. 

In its Jan. 30 report of the Los 
Alamos invesogaoons, the D .O .E. 
found that severe weaknesses in 
internal management had con-
tributed to the WIdespread 10 or 
theft of computers and eqwpment, 
misuse of lab-issued credit cards, 
and intimidation of employees 
against speaking Out about their 
concern, Including the firing of

In early January, UC President 
Richard C. Atkinson announced 
the replacement of top manage-
m'ent officials at Los Alamos, 
including the appointment of a new 
interim director, new auditors and 
new security diVision leaders. The 
university also re-hired the two 
security officials and appointed an 
oversight board to guide the new 
director, which includes three UC 
Regents, one tanford University 
professor and UCSD Chancellor 
Robert C. Dynes. 

"If I look out around the coun-
try and ask what alternatives there 
are to the University of California 
to run these labs for the defense of 
the nation, I don't see any other 
insotution that has thc intellectual 
horsepower and would do It for the 
nght reasons," Dynes said. "The 
UniverSIty of Califorrua doesn't do 

it for the money." 
Dynes, a phYSICiSt, has worked 

closely to advise UC laboratories 
for over 20 years, serving as Vlce 
chair of the Presidents Council on 
the ational LaboratOries for the 
past decade. 

The University of California 
must now wait until the end of 
April to find out if the D .O .E. Will 
cononue to let the New MCXlcan

50SC claims Sapphire 
worm was fastest ever 
The Sapphire computer worm that 

attacked the global Intemet Jan. 25 was the 
fastest computer wonm ever recorded, 
according to a team of network secunty 
experts from UCSD, the San Diego 
SuperComputer Center, the Eureka, Cahf.-
based Silicon Defense, UC Berkeley and the 
Intemabonal Computer SCience Institute In 
Ber eley. 

According to the secunty team, the 
Sapphire womn, which IS also called the 
Slammer womn, doubled ItS numbers every 
8.5 seconds dunng the first minute of Its 
attack. Within 10 minutes, the wonm had 
Infected over 75,000 vulnerable hosts, whICh 
spewed billions of cOpies of the womn Into 
cyberspace. The . resulling chaos slowed 
Internet traffic and Interiered With many bUSI-
ness seMces. 

The Sapphire is only 376 bytes, which 
enabled It to reproduce rapidly and fit in a 
netwo ·packet" that was sent one-way to 
potential victims - an aggressive approach 
deSigned to Infect all vulnerable machines 
qUickly and saturate the Internet's band-
Width. 

According to experts, the speed With 
whICh the worm copied Itself was limited 
only by the capaCity of indiVIdual network 
conneCtlons. 

The secunty team found that nearly 43 
percent of the Infected machines were locat-
ed In the United States, 12 percent were In 
South orea and more than 6 percent were 
In ChJna.

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 6, Z003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Lab: D.O.E. to make evaluation by April 30 
continued from page 1 

the nuclear sector. 
" I'm worried about it," Dynes 

said, explaining that at this point 
the University of California is "not 
overly secure" about keeping its 
contract. 

According to Dynes, it is the 
University of California's sense of 
public responsibility that leads it to 
manage national laboratories for 
the government, bur faculty and 
students also benefit from collabo-
rations and internships at the labo-
ratories. Numerous UCSD stu-
dents and faculty members have 
spent time at Los Alamos; accord-
ing to Dynes, their number is "at 
least as much" as at any other 
University of California. 

The D.O.E. report found that 
in addition to the laboratory being 
overly lax in employee's spending 
- one example was the attempted 
purchase of a $20,000 Mustang 
spons car on a lab-i ued credit 
card - the laboratory's manage-
ment had also issued memoran-
dums that emphasized loyalty to 
the laboratory "at the possible 
expense of full disclosure of identi-
fied problems." Gu.idance included 
such lines as "Resist the temptation 
to 'spill your guts.'" "HandwTitten 
notes can be especially damaging ... 
They are not easily disavowed," and 
"Finger-pointing will just make the 
program look bad." 

According to previous repons 
by the D.O.E., a flawed accounting 
system had left the university in the 
dark about many improper transac-
tions made by lab employees. Only 
items of a cost of above $5,000 were 
to be reported, which, according to 
the two security officials, left the 
door open for employees to make 
inappropriate purchases, some-
times splitting larger sums into sev-
eral smaller sums to escape detec-

tion. Ln addition, according to the 
security officials, only about 30 per-
cent of lab equipment that was 
required to have bar codes actually 
had them, making lost items 
untraceable and effective audits 
near impossible. 

T hough allegations have put the 
figures of money lost on mis ing 
computers and other property at 
upwards of $2.7 million, no ligures 
detailing the losses have yet been 
made public. 

The problems, according to 
Dynes, arose in part because of a 
certain culture that exists at the iso-
lated Lo Alamos National 
Laboratory, which is located up on 

" I don't see any other 
institution tlu1t has the 
intellectual horsepower 
and would do it far the 

right reasons."

los Alamos oversight board 

a mesa, hours away from 
Albuquerque, 

"They start believing that 
becau e they're doing something 
that's for the public good, they can 
break some rules," Dynes said. 
"The University of California will 
now have to be much more hands-
on," 

Apart from ongoing investiga-
tions into the scope of the problem 
and rcassigrunents of top positions 
at the laboratory, some of the mea-
sures t:alc.en by the University of 
California include instituting new 

Brown Bag It! 
Author Appearance 

systems of checks and balances, 
such as the IInplementation of rules 
stating that the Los Alamos busi-
ness practice and audit directors 
must now report directly to U 
business practice and audit officials. 

Whether or not the mismanage-
ment has affected the quality of sci-
entific research at Los Alamos has 
yet to be determined. According to 
Dynes, his role is to dig into the 
technical programs to make sure 
they do not have flaws eqwvalent to 
those in management. 

"Right now we don't know if 
there are [flaws] or not," Dynes 
said. "If there are, we want to find 
them so that it's the University of 
California that corrects them, not 
an outside entity." 

According to the federal report, 
the laboratory accounts of missing 
computers and other equipment 
omitted specifying whether there 
was any sensitive information 
stored on these items. Laboratory 
officials, however, have said that 
there was not. 

Dynes said that his role is also to 
make sure that the quality of the 
science conducted is retained, and 
that the laboratory cononues to 
attract high-quality scientists. 

"These laboratories function 
well because they have good sCien-
tists," Dynes said. "The recruit-
ment is the wellspring for the 
weapons program. We can't just do 
the programs the government asks 
for - we must do good science to 
make the labs attractive to good sci-
entists. It 

The Los Alamos National 
Laboratory employs about 7,500 
UC employees. The University of 
California's contract expires in 
2005, but either side may tenninate 
at any time. The D.O.E. will evalu-
ate the University of California 's 
performance by April 30.

Bond: Retirement will 
make way for travel, family 

comim<ed from page 1 
cellor for academic planni ng and 
resources. 

As of press time, a course and 
professor evaluation rating for 
Bond could not be found . 

Bond said he never grades on a 
curve, so he would not have to "pit 
students against each other." 
Furthermore, he encourages Stu-
dents to help each other in class; 
however, he does not encourage 
them to help each other on 
mid terms and finals . 

Students say that Bond will not 
only be remembered for his teach-
ing, but also for his distinct charac-
ter. 

"He was never roo busy to talk 
with anyone," said Revelle student 
Garo Bournoutian. 

Bond's students and colleagues 
describe him as a man of great 
integrity, passion and conviction. 
Revelle College Council Financial 
Controller Daniel Sollofwill mo t-
Iy remember Bond's "wide, heart-
warming smile." 

Bond says his dedication IS dri-
ven by his love for teaching, and he 
has aspired to be a univerSity pro-
fessor since he first entered college. 
He maintains that hi dedication IS 
strengthened because of the people 
he works with. 

"I have been fortunate to work 
with some incredible students and 
wonderful staff," Bond said. 

Since coming to UCSD, Bond 
said he has liked every one of the 
six different bosses he has worked 
for. 

Bond 's plans after retirement 
include going abroad to pain. He 
also looks forward to spend lllg 
more time with his wife and chil-
dren. He wants to read and do 
many different things. 

However, he would still like to 
be involved with the UCSD com-
munity, and may teach a course 
next fall. f Ie will contmue to wnte 
recommendation letters and adVise 
students. 

The search for a new provost 
for Revelle College has already 
begun. The qualification for d 
provost includes bClng a faculty 
member at UCSD for a minimum 
of 10 years. This person must enJoy 
working With students and be cho-
en by the earch committee. 

The final deCISion will be made 
by Senior Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs Marsha 
Chandler. 

Many people believe that it will 
be hard to replace Bond because of 
the high standards he had for hlln-
self. 

'" tried to fill hi shoes, but It 
was a nearly impossible job," said 
Barbara Sawrey, chemiStry depart-
ment Vlce chair of educations and 
the acting Revelle College provost 
during Bond's sabbatical leave in 
2001 -02 . "He holds a type of dedi-
cation and compassion that IS hard 
to find . He symbolizes the heart of 
UCSD because he has put so much 
into it." 

Long before he came to 
UCSD, Bond lived In BrookJyn, 

. Y., and served 111 the army for a 
year. He completed his undergrad-

Applicants 
deserve aid despite 

drug history 
Congress is considering whether or not to 

reauthorize the Higher Education Act, which 
provides for federal programs that support, 
among other things, financial aid for college 
students. The United States Student 
Association has coordinated lobbyi.ng efforts 
to ensure HEA reauthorization, and to ask 
for specific amendments to the act. One 

am~ndment it should lobby hard for and to 
which legislators should pay particular atten-
tion pertains to financial aio and drugs. 

Thousands of students are denied finan-
cial aid every year because they check "yes" 
on question 35 of the Free Application for 
Federal Student Aid, asking them if they have 

eve~ been ~onvicted of a drug-related crime. 
ThiS quesoon was added to the FAFSA in 
1998, when the HEA was amended to make 
federal grants, loans and work-study pro-
grams unavailable to those convicted of pos-

~essing, using or selling drugs. The law was 
Inte~de~ to Oolste.r the na.tion's war on drugs, 
but IS mlsgwded, meffecnve and unfair. 

This provision doesn't seem to be doing 
anything to reduce high school and college 
students' drug use. The National Institute on 
prug Abuse's figw:es show minimal change 
In percentage of high school students using 
illicit drugs over the last five years. 
. Furth enn ore, there is no logical connec-

tion ~etween a drug conviction and how 
deservIng someone is of financial aid. Some 
argue that changing this law would be con-
doning drug use. Yet no one argues that the 
federal gove.rnment condones. murder, rape 
or automobile theft - all cnmes of which 
one may be convicted and still be eligible for 
federal financial aid under the HEA. Drug 
offenses ~re singled out, though they are 
often mInor diarges for possession -
"youthful indiscretions" that do not hinder 
someone's chances for college success. 

But a criminal past of any kind should 
n?t affect financial ai~ . If someone has paid 
hIS. or ~er debt to socIety and gotten into a 

u~verslty, a college education could be the 
difference between falling back into a life of 
crime and bettering his sItuation. 

The HEA is crucial to educating talent-
ed students of all economic backgrounds 
and shouJd be reauthorized. However, it 
must,be .amend~d to prevent the govern-
ments WIthholding of federal aid from stu-
dents who could benefit from it.

North Korea not pre,eminent threat 
United States should focus military efforts on Iraq 

By DumN FIEUCH 
Staff lNriter 

Since it has been made public that 
North Korea is well on its way to get-
ting - or may already have - nuclear 
capabilities, the situation with the east-
Asian nation is becoming more precar-
ious with each passing day; an official 
North Korean state paper even went so 
far as to promise to turn America Into 
a "sea of fire" if we were to challenge 
the regime in its supposed "national 
security" efforts. With increasing defi-
ance directed toward the United 
States, North Korea is wrapped up in 
its efforts to oppose international order 
and is tossing out agreements made 
during previous U.S. administrations 
that limited its exploration of nuclear 
weapons capabilities. With almost 
prophetic ingenuity, President George 
W. Bush correctly labeled North 
Korea after 9/11 as part of an "axJS of 
evil,' along with one other nation that 
we are currently in tension with· Iraq. 

A former Democratic chairman of 
the House Foreign Affairs Committee, 
Lee Hamilton, sums up that side of the 
argument nicely: "[Bush's 'axis of evil' 
speech) has made diplomacy more dif-
ficult in the months since (9/111 and 
probably exacerbated the dangers that 
(Bushl was seeking to contain.' 

For Hamilton and those who agree 
with him, Bush's "axis of evil" speech is 
provoking the Nonn Koreans to chal-
lenge Bush in a battle of pomposity -
twO peacocks strutting their stuff before 
an international arena. Democratic Sen 
Evan Bayh further elaborated on 
Hamilton's point when he saId that 
Bush has been using "bellicose language 
ftoward North Korea), nOt thInking 
what the consequences of that might 
be,' clearly insmuatlng Wt we all k.now 
where we can POlOt the blamang finger. 

Oh, but how ea ily they forget the

" [Canton's1 by,the,book 
appeasement of the North 
Korean regime led direcuy 

to the current potential 
conflict. " 

President William Jefferson Clinton, 
and how his by-the-book appeasement 
of the North Korean regime led direct-
ly to the current potential conflict. 

What the Clinton administration 
did back in 1994 was sign a no-nukes-
for-cash agreement that stipulated 
that, provided that Pyongyang promis-
es not to use ai d we were henceforth 
endtng its way for nuclear purposes, 

we would take Korea at Its word. But 
we all know what happened: the North 
Koreans did no such dung, and With-
out Uncle Sam checlong up on them, 
we shouldn't have been thal hocked 
when recently they unveiled nuclear 
capabihoes and commenced theIr ritu-

alistic thumbing of their noses at the 
United States. 

The Bush administration is rightly 
pointing the finger at Clintonites and 
their naivete in foreign affairs, which 
has left the problem of North Korea 
f~r the Bush camp to fix. Speaking 
dIrectly to the former administration, 
Bush said in last Tue day's State of the 
Union, "We will not deny; we will not 
ignore; we will not pass along our 
problems to other Congresses to other 
presidents and other generations." 

A spokesman for the Bush adminis-
tration said Clintons deal with the 
North Koreans "frontloaded all the 
benefits alld left the difficult things to 
the end," passing the buck to Bush in 
2002-03 . Clinton and his team of for-
eign affairs appeasers happily gave 
away benefits of the deal - money, 
through which North Korea used to 
bolster its nuclear research facilities -
without checking if the other end of 
the bargain had been met. The agree-
ment stipulated that if the regime 
attempted to fulfill its nuclear ambi-
tions, we would not meet our side of 
the bargain (Le., sending cash). But 
even those in the intelligence commu-
nity had no idea, since the money 
never SlOpped flowing. 

But whi le the North Korean situa-
tion is becoming more and more tenu-
ous, many have pointed out the seem-
ingly glaring contradiction in the Bush 
administration ~ preference to focus on 
Iraq instead of North Korea . Indeed, an 
article in the pt. 30, 2002 Issue of 
USA Today read, "Gush i) struggling to 
explam why the adlllilli tratlon is plan-
ning for war against one member of the

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

C.A.P.E. reviews don't reveal all aspects Bush: Iraq more of a threat 
than North Korea horse's 

mouth 
EdWu 

D isgusted readers (32) over-whelmingly denounced the column as "liberal 
tripe," criticizing it in particular for 
taking "potshots" at helpless AS. 
Council members and actions. Not 
all readers found "Horses Mouth" 
one of the most reviled portions of 
newsprint on campus; a few souls 
(3) found the writing the best thing 
since canned ravioli. Additional 
comments include too few llamas 
(9), an overabtmdance of unneces-
sari ly polysyllabic descriptors (6) 
and generally too much reading 
assigned (23,424). 

ow, while Course And 
Professor Evaluations works hard 
over the school year and summer to 
bring us paragraphs like the one 
above, they arc by and large useless 
to anyone actually trying to get a 
handle on how the course and pro-
fessors rate. Sure, it may be rela-
tively simple to find the steUar pro-
fessors who teach with such apti-
tude, their likenesses should be 
placed on a marble pillar in the 
middle of the Price Center, in front 
of which there should be mandated 
ritualistic sacrifices every dawn. But 
by and large, the paragraphs are 
useless because the "essential char-
acteristics" that the CAP.E. editors 
try to glean from illegible notes 
scrawled in all of three minutes of 
contemplation can do little to char-
acterize the course or the teaching 
style in a manner that is useful to 
either students or the dcparonent. 

This is not to say that C.A.P.E. 
is entirely useless; the enrollment 

statistics and percentage that rec-
ommend the course and professor 
are extremely helpful. But this 
writer is left wondering why all of 
the bubbles that the srudents fill are 
not all reponed; the average hours 
of study time would no doubt be a 
useful measure. Perhaps it is 
because of sheer lack of space in the 
C.A.P.E. book; but it seems to make 
little sense to print the thing and 
sell it at near cost when it would 
cost much less to put everything up 
on an online database and allow 
everyone to see the range of statis-
tics. If it is a simple manner of 
recouping costs, can anyone 
scrounge a few thousand dollars to 
pay the editors and runners, in an 
endeavor that, when implemented 
properly (which may be the enrire 
problem), is no doubt of great ser· 
vice to undergraduates? 

Some intrepid fellows have 
started a Web site at brrp:II'/UWW.llcs-
dproftssors.cum that has been adver-
tised by a somewhat ragged and 
drooping poster In the Price Center 
over the past two weeks. AI though 
the domain name is mostly down, 
when this writer managed to catch 
it in one of its somewhat-alive 
moments, it had all the trappings of 
what might make a good rating 
evaluation: plenty of numbers 
reported and spaces for every stu-
dent to report comments. The only 
problem is that the site has almost 
no traffic. Thus, maybe a rather 
simple way of getting an honest, 
detailed course evaluation from 
other students is to integrate it into 
StudentLink somehow. 

While filling in bubbles and 
gathering statistics will no doubt 
garner a wider sample during lec· 
tures, it seems the plaUSIble online 
way of getting detailed paragraphs 
(a la http://www.tmlllZUTI.cum) is to 
put the entire process online.

When looking up one's final sched-
ules, perhaps, in week nine or 10, 
maybe a request could be put neKt 
to each course on the schedule 
requesting reviews. Again, 
Amazon.com style, other srudents 
could rate the reviews, determimng 
which came to the top and were 
seen first and providing an incen-
tive to provide thorough evalua-
tions. And since it could be run 
through StudentLink, instead of a 
third party, like http://www.ucsdprrr 
ftssorr.CIIm, simple measures could 
prevent ballot stuffing against pro-
fessors either reviled or loved. 

While CAP.E. no doubt serves 
an important purpo e because no 
online polling would ever be able to 
achieve the same number of 
responses that showing up at indi-
vidual lectures provides, the lone 
CAP.E. editor cramming a mish-
mash of answers into a barely 
coherent paragraph is no replace-
ment for detailed, unedited student 
reviews. 

This writer, at least, finds that 
the vast majority of useful informa-
tion he gets about courses and pro-
fessors gets passed by word of 
mouth, not through C.A.P.E. That 
seems rather 20th century when the 
infrastructure that makes detailed 
evaluations instantly accessible is 
sitting at our fingertips. Kudos to 
whoever is (somewhat) putting up 
http://www.ucsdproJtssrm.cl117l. but no 
doubt an official system attached to 
StudentLink would be best - or at 
least better than what some writers 
(1) think of what passes as useful 
information in CAP.E. 

This column stands for egalitanan 
principles. As a resul~ all correspon· 
dence sent to e2wu@ucsd.edu Will 
be treated with the same amount of 
incompetence. 

contimll!d from page 4 
there is as strong a case as any to be 
made as to why this administration 
should take it one step at a time, 
focusillg on rraq first. 

Members of Congress in the 
early '90s who wished for and suc-
ceeded in cutting the defense and 
intelligence budgets thought it was 
unnecessary to spend billions of 
dollars on a military that had just 
exited the Cold War as the world 's 
only superpower. Therefore, they 
reasoned, cuts would be beneficial , 
since the revenue saved could be 
spent on other things like social 
programs. But what they forgot, 
and continue to forget to this day, 
is that peace never lasts for long. 
Throughout history, peace has 
been the exception, not the norm. 
In a short time we would find our-
selves again fighting for world safe-
ty. 

The time is now. Two nations 
are challenging the safety of the 
international order. And just like 
former oppressive regimes that 
were thrown into the trash can of 
history, the United States is weigh-
ing the possibilities of fighting for a 
safer world without sadistic dicta-
tors. But this time, we are not priv-
ileged to have the strong military 
and we need to do that which needs 
to be done: deal comprehensively 
with Iraq and North Korea without 
tip-toeing around one of them. 

We need a new policy. And the 
right decision is to confront Iraq 
first, then orth Korea. While 
North Korea is technically the big-
ger threat, since it has nuclear 
capabilities and can easily u e them 
to threaten our friends nearby 
(South Korea), or even ourselves, 
dealing directly with a nuclear 

nation is a much grander task than 
WIth the non-nuclear. Rememher 
the Cold War? There was a reason 
they called it Mutually Assured 
Destruction: it would be M AL>. to 
wage war. 

What makes Iraq the premiere 
focus of American foreign policy IS 
its attempt to go nuclear. We know 
well enough of Saddam Husseins 
intentions of destruction, to one day 
take over the Middle East, to intim-
idate other nations, and also to one 
day be able to call a nuclear bomb 
his own. He was tOO close for com-
fort in getting the bomb when we 
interfered last time - the London 
International Institute for Strategic 
Studies has reponed that complete 
designs and productive capabtllties 
for nuclear weapons were found by 
U.N . inspectors the first time 
around . And if we don't do it agam, 
and do it right, we will have rwo 
nuclear nations wishing our death. 
If we thought Iraq was bad enough 
now, how would we feel once we 
have to stare down the dual-barrels 
of a nuclear-tipped shotgun known 
as Iraq and North Korea? 

The North Korean situation as 
it stands now is the very product of 
the appeasement that some wish to 
bestow on Saddam and his regtme. 
It is precisely because we are trou-
bled over the current situation in 
Pyongyang that we need to stop 
Saddam before he acquires 
weapons that will make him 
impossible to deal with. First Iraq, 
then North Korea, and we'll all be 
safer. In Bush's own words: "Our 
na tion and the world must learn 
the lessons of the Korean 
Peninsula and not allow an even 
greater threat to rise up in Iraq." 
Bravo.

Dodor: Low-rise jeans 
cut off circulation 

By NICOLE ROCHE 
Daily Kansan (U. Kansas) 

(U-WIRE) LAWRENCE, Kan. 
- Low-rise jeans just might be the 
new corset. 

Women have been cutting off 
their circulation for cenruries ill an 
attempt to appear thin, cramming 
their bodies into clothi ng primed 
to burst a t the seams. 

Depending on a person 's si7-c, 
wearing these jeans may be a social 
risk - especially when bending 
over means those Gap jeans live up 
to their name. But even worse than 
a flash of crack or thong, these 
trendy denims may be a health haz.-
ard . 

Last week, a Canadian doctor 
warned that low-rise jeans can 
pinch a sensory nerve under the 
hipbone and cause a tingling or 
burning sensation . 

Paul Morte, a Lawrence, Kan., 
neurologist, said he had een more 
than 1,000 cases of the condition in 
the 29 years he has been practicing 
- about 1.5 cases every two weeks. 

The tingling sensation is kllOwn 
as meral gia paresthetica, Mone 
said. It can occur as a result of 
pregnancy, diabetes, obesity and 
constricting clothing. 

Morte said recent cases were 
likely a result of fa hi on trend . 

") ee a lot of people wearing 
tight, low-cut Jeans," Morte said. 
")f you wear somcthing very tight, 
especially low-cut, that nerve can 
get compressed." 

Mone said years ago he had 
seen a Las Vegas dancer wi th mer-
algia paresthetica . Thc woman 
wore a belt made with si lver dollars 

that compressed the nerve and 
caused a burning sensation. 

Meralgia paresthetica is not a 
serious condition, Morte said, and 
about 95 percent of the time symp-
toms will go away on their own. 

"Usually the treatment is loos-
eni ng the clothi ng," he said. 

In some instances, a numbing 
injection may be needed, and 
surgery may be required in rare cir-
cumstances. 

Men should also be aware of the 
potentia l problem, Morte said, 
because heavy lOol belts often com-
press the nerve. 

Men aren't immune lO the low-
rise craze either. Jeans manufactur-
ers have expanded their lines to 
include men's jeans. 

"I don't think we have any jeans 
that aren't low- ri~e now," said Matt 
Donahoe, manager at Abercrombie 
& Fitch in Lawrence, Kan. 

Unlike women's low-rise jeans, 
which focus on decorative thongs 
and glimpses of derriere, Donahoe 
said men's low-rise jeans we re 
designed to show off taut 
abdomens. He said low-nse boxers 
for men are al 0 becoming popular. 

Donahoe sa id low-rise women's 
briefs were a "sexy-but-sophlsticat-
cd" comple1l1ent to trendy jeans. 

\Vhile low-rise Jeans may be a 
hea lth risk, the only risk of low-ri;,e 
underwear 1I1ight be a frosty fa nny. 
Besides, lOW-fiSC women's ullller-
wear may signal a move JWJY fro m 
the jeweled "Foxy" and "Flirt" 
thongs. 

"I hope so," said Allison Scott, 
associate manager at The Gap in 
Lawrence, Kan. U) don 't think they 
were ever cool."

Real Worlds collide in the Price Center 
don't pop 
my sheep 

Dave Bynum 

TWO very "Real Worlds" came crashing cogether last Thursday in the very heart of our great university. 
Approaching the Price Center, [ noticed that 
it was a lot more crowded than usual. There 
was all ul1usuall y large antiwar or peace rally 
(whichever you prefer - my allns here arc 
nO[ political but rather observational) going 
on in Price Center. From what I knew about 
the campus' politically active demographic, 
the audience seemed larger than usual. it 
turned out, a good portion of the crowd was 
made up of some strange hybrid of MTV-
watching travel lovers. COl1tiki Vacations 
had brought Frank and Steve from "The 
Real ""orld: Las Vegas" to campus to pro-
mote vacation packages. Standmg on 
Library Walk and looking down on the 
scene, I realized that our campus had 
become a mIcrocosm of our country; the 
Price Center had been divided into two 
worlds: "The Real World" and the real "real 
world." 

I hope you know that there i something 
wrong with the fact that I JUSt had to write 
the words "the real 'real world . '" 
Unfortunately, the phrase "the real world" 
just has no real meaning anymore. Besides 
being the place we live and a television show, 
it's aJohn Mayer song. 

Confused? I think everyone is. 
Walking down to the Price Center, my 

head spun at the sadly hilarious juxtaposition 
of those who were rallying for a "peaceful 
solution" and those who were rallying for a 
piece of Frank and Steve. 

Everyone knows that these two groups of 
people exist, and while they seem to be on 
different extremes of political concern, lately 
it seems that the gap betwecn the groups is 
slowly closing. For instance, as many pcople 
watched the conclusion of "The Bachelor" 
this year as watched the tatc of the Union 
last year. Keep in mind that the State of the 
UllIon I on probably five channels at the 
same time and 'The Bachelor" runs on JUSt 
one. dd the numbers for "The Bachelor" 
and the State of Ihe Union together, and you 
have the number of people who watched the 
Super Bowl thl~ )'ear. 

\Vhat confuses me about the fasclI1Jtion 
of our student body WIth the cast of "The 
Real World" IS that the whole prenllsc of 
these type of shows IS that these are normal 
people like you and me, and If we feel so 
IIlciincd, we can watch the highlights of a 
ccrtam period of their lives. The problem I~ 
thaI the second the), become a part of these 
show>, they arc no longer real people JUSt like 
you and me, the}' arc celcbntic~ - only whdt 
are we .. uppo ed to celebrate about these 

people? 
These people send in videos and then get 

puc up rene-free for some period of time 
while their life is taped. Their whole job 
seems to be to have sex with people and 
argue with their roommates about it. When 
everyone gets tired of watching that, they 
send the cast on a vacation from the cough 
life wherever they are living (in Las Vegas's 
case, on the top floor of the Palms hotel), to 
some other exotic location (Australia). We 
call this reality television. Whose reality is 
this? Someone should make a show about 
people who have co carry 16 units and divide 
their time between studying and being 
rejected by women. That's the reaJity ( am 
familiar with. 

I asked a few girls what the fascination was 
with these guys, which caused exclamations 
like "( willncver wash my face again" (I wish 
I were making thiS all up). The most com-
1110n respon e was "they are so cute." Well 
that just isn't enough . There are plenty of 
good-looking dudes walking around this 
campus and none of them are good-looking 
enough co kiss girls who are I med up co see 
them and at the same time attempt to sell 
them vacation packages. 

Do these girls want relationships with 
thcse guys, or do they want to have their 
breasts autographed? Isn't the fun of meet-
ing a guy getting to know him? Most of 
these girls have already watched 10 hours 
worth of documented footage about these 
guys. I have watched the show a few times. 
1 know that both of these guys lept with a 
couple of girls, and one of them almost 
cried because a girl threw a fork at him. 
That is more than 1 know about some of my 
roommates . 

[ have also watched the spin-offs of "The 
Real World." Yes, reality show spin-
offslgame shows. They exist - two in fact: 
"Battle of the Seasons" and "Bactle of the 
Sexes." These shows take former cast mem-
bers from reality shows and pit them against 
each other in games we all played at our lOth 
birthday party. Meanwhile, they argue about 
how one girl crewed another girl out of 
some promotional deal that they were going 
CO use to cash in on their undeserved celebri-
ty. 

So to recap, teve and Frank try to get 
people to take trips to Australta, and con-
cerned students try to keep their friends and 
countrymen from havmg to take a U1p to the 
Middle East. The whole thing is a little trip-
Pl'. It seems impo~sible that these twO worlds 
could coeXist, but they do. Right here at 
UC 'D, and they do so in harmony. As the 
dcmomtrators marched out of the Pnce 
Center, they made sure to stay out of the 
numerous photos that were being taken of 
Steve, Frank and X number of women. \"110 
knows what Il1Ight have gone down If they 
had marched right through the crowd WJlt-
ing for their moment of glory with the nor-
mal guys who had thclr iJves on teleVision . It 
IS good to know tl1Jt the del11ol1strJlor~ wen: 
true paclliclst,.

n IE UC D GUARDIAN THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 2(0) 

Reader: Author dissects subjects of novels 
continued from page 7 

novel about that. T hat your father 
was sometimes II little cranky and 
drunk when he'd drive home -
sure, write a novel about that. Bur to 
write a novel about the profound 
transforming experience of readlOg 
a book - that you're not suppa ed 
to do becau~e that's academic and 
dry and who wants ro read a book 
about readlllg a book? And I 
thought, well I might like to read a 
book about readll1g a book, and If 
sOll1eone else isn't going ro write 
one, then maybe I will. 0 that's sort 
of where it came fr0111 . 

G: David Hare adapted your 
novel. Are you satisfied with the 
job he did? 

/lIC: I'm hugely satisfied with 
the job David did. I don 't have that 
thing that a lot of novelists hal'e 
about sacred texts, as if a book of 
mine was some sort of holy relic. 
Any book of mine is even more or 
less the best I can do \vi th those peo-

pie and those situations at that point 
in my li fe. Ten years later 1 would 
write the book completely different-
ly. 0 if somebody as gifted as David 
Hare comes along and wants to do 
something else with it, wants to see 
if he can take this sequence 0111e-
where else, my answer is: "Great, 
go, let's see what you can do." ['m 
very happy that the movie has a life 
of its own. It's very close to the 
book, but it's also a work of art in 
itself, and David wri tes the transi-
tions beautifully and holds it togeth-
er remarkably well and then I th ink 
it preserves something that I love in 
Woolf that I tried to bring to my 
own novel and I'm vcry happy to 
feel it in the movie: this sense of a 
certain hope, a certai n abstinence if 
you wi ll , that can survive the worst 
that's happened to people. 

G: Are any of your other 
books being made into movies? 

Me: Yes, another book of mine, 
"A Home at the End of the World," 

is going to start filming in April. [It 
stars) Colin Farrell and a theater 
guy named Dallas Roberts and 
we're still talking to two actresses. 
T hat starts fi lming April I and it's 
very much a low-budget thmg. It's 
being produced by Ki ller Films, the 
people who did "Far From I leaven" 
and "Boys Don'[ ry." We have five 
weeks to shoot it. I tlld write the 
script for this one, and here f{oes. 

G: Is there anything else that 
you are currently working on 
besides the movie? 

lv1C: Yes, 1'111 in the middle of 
this new novel, and there is a stage 
adaptatIOn of anothcr novel of 
mi ne tha t would be "Flesh and 
Blood" that I'm try111g to kind of 
get polished for its open111g in May. 

If you're interested, pick up one 
of his novels at a bookstore, and to 
hiS his novel come to life, "1 he 
Hours" is currentl y playing in the-
aters everywhere.

ensemble 

brings old and

Grad student orga-

nizes eclectic concert 
for fourth year 

By lISAMAK 
Staff Writer 

I n today's musical arena, which is heaVily sedated with pop, rock and the like, it is a rarity to come 
across truly orib'inal mll~ic that man-
ages to combine the familiar and the 
unexpL'Cted. Side N ide B, a large 
ensemble group led by composer, 
musician and UCSD j,,,,aduate stu-
dent Alan Lechu5za, has indeed 
proven to be such a rare trea t. 

An ongoing ensemble project 
funded by Black Phone Records tha t 
began in 1999, Side N ide B per-

the Mandeville Music Center.

about half of the actual perfonnance 
devia tes from notation and consists 
of improvi ations from the musi-
cians. Conductor Christopher dler 
has the discretion of interpreti ng the 
music and dccldlllg the extent of the 
improvs. The music itself is engag-
inb' and dynamic, an ec!ecoc mix of 
sowlli that is paradoxically discor-
dant and well-blended at the same 
ti me. 

Although Lechusza does the 
composi ng, he admits feeli ng 
incrl-dibly humbled by the opportu-
nity !O perform WIth his ensemble 
group. 

"These are ome of the best, if 
not tbt best, musician in the world," 
he sa id. "AJI of these guys are 
acclaimed performcrs in thei r own 
right." 

The twO parts of the concert are 
appropriately called "Side A" and 
"Side 13 ," wi th a "pause" (mtermis-

THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS II 

Ellen Burstyn is the 'Old Confederate Widow' 
The Old Globe premieres powerful one-woman show 

By JESSICA LONG 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Old Globe's 2003 season is off to a powerful start wi th the world premiere of "The 
Oldest Living Confederate 
Widow Tells AJI." T his original 
production tells the story of Lucy 
Marsden, a woman who now, at 
the age of 99, is "still more or less 
standing. " 

This new production is based 
on the book by Allan Gurganus, 
which has spent eight months on 
the Ntw York Times bestseller list 
and has been translated into 12 
languages. Now it is be ing 
brought to the tage in this power-
fu l performance tha t is sure to cap-
tiva te and impress the viewer. 

What makes this play so pow-
erful is that it is a one-woman 
show. For over two hours, Ellen 
Burstyn becomes Marsden and 
takes the audience through the ups 
and downs, the trials and tribula-
tions of her li fe as a young gi rl of 
15 marryi ng a man 35 years her 
senior, all the way to her li fe now, 
almost 85 years la ter. 

Burstyn, who has won both 
Oscar and Tony awards over her 

extensive career in film and the-
atre, does a wonderful job becom-
ing Marsden, a woman who has 
seen nearly a century of struggle, 
yet still finds joy in her past as well 
as her present. She makes it 
impossible not to love the honest, 
open, smiling Marsden. However, 
even more remarka ble tha n 
Burstyn's portrayal of Marsden is 
the way that she makes Marsden 
portray the people she is ta lking 
about in the stories she tell s. 

T he set itself is simple - the 
interior of a nursing home - but 
it becomes a powerful aid to the 
production. I mages are projected 
onto the large, blank back wall of 
the set to hel p give a visual repre-
senution of the picrure that is 
being pai nted by Burstyn. The 
lighting is also used artfu lly to 
accompany the rollercoas ter of 
emotions that run through the 
production. 

T he audience itself becomes an 
integral part of the performance. 
T he pl ay is written as though 
Marsden is ta lki ng to a group who 
has come to the nurslllg home to 
listen to her te ll her tory, since 
she is now "the oldest living 
Confederate widow," and she is 

very eager to share the 
tales of her long life 
with them. It helps to 
make the audience feel 
at ease because she is 
talking to them and 
even integrates them 
into the show at ti mes. 

This does seem to 
be a drawback at times, 
because Bursryn has no 
one except the audience 
to react to, which 
means that there are 
times when she may not 
get the reaction she 
expects, but she has to 
work with it anyway. 
And she does, very well . 

This is a wonderful 
production that draws 
the viewer in and keeps 
them interested and 
involved throughout 
the production. "The

"The Secret Love between

C omputer programs, Wee any texIS, are not "objective" or "universal;" rather, 
Interactions with tbeie systems inevitably reveal characteristics of tile culture that 
produced them. Prevailing discourses in the fie ld lend to erase this cultural 
embeddedness. In particular, narratives surrounding computer-based cultural 
producuon, such as inter3CtJVIty, vtrtuaJ realIty and new media, consistently describe 

proce~ses aDd practIces that strongly resemble improvISation, yet the word 
"Improvisaoon" Itself rarely appears.

Feb. 1 was a long day because 
both skiers and snowboarders 
raced in a giant slalom twice. 
SCCSC used this good weather 
opportunity to make lip a cancelled 
race from earlier this season. Feb. 2 
came to pass less hectically, since 
skiers competed in slalom in the 
morning, followed by snowboard-
crs and skiers in boarder cross and 
skier cross.

female skiers Sierra Bourne and 
Oanielle Crockett swept first and 
second place, respectively. Men's

Tom Christensen also placed in the 
top 15, earning 10th and 11 th, 
respectively. Female snowboarder 
Christie Schmidt placed seventh, 
with Biliana Veleva and Jackie 
Myers placing ninth and 10th 
behind her. Luke Mitchell finished 
14th for men's snowboarding. 

The second giant slalom com-
petition boasted Oanielle 
Crockett in first place for the 
women's skiers. Katie Roof and 
Stephanie Theisen each earned a 
top-15 finish, finishing 13th and 
15 th, respectively. Sharbrough 
and Collins placed fifth and sev-
enth respectively, followed by 
UCSO's 12th, 13th and 14th place 
finishers : Christensen, Zachary 
Beres and Cohen respectively. 
Biliana Vel eva led UCSO's female 
snowboarders, placing fifth, fol-
lowed by JaclUe Myers and 
Christie chmidt in eighth and 
11 th respectively. Peter Butcher 
and Mitchell held 14th and 15th 
place finishes respectively. 

On Feb. 2, the slalom event 
crowned Sharbrough as the men's 

leader, beating UCSB's two-year 
champion. Sharbrough was joined 
by Cohen, Christensen and Chase 
Vandergrift finishing seven th, 
eighth and 12th respectively. 
Women's skiers Bourne and 
Crockett placed first and second 
respectively. UCSO's tephanie 
Theisen (seventh) and Erin 
Richards (10th) also scored top-10 
times. Snow boarders do not com-
pete in the slalom event. 

Boarder cross and skier cross are 
events in which heats of four to six 
competitors race at the same time 
through bank turns, table-top jumps 
and sets of roller-style jumps. The 
first two racers in each heat advance. 
Following the many rounds of com-
petition, only the top eight racers 
count in the league standings. 

In the event, Collins placed 
fourth, with teammate 
Christensen in eighth. Female 
skier Katherine Wurden placed 
sixth. Both men's and women's 
snowboarding teams were el imi-
nated in the semifinals.

Women's swim fall to USD 168-126 
Tritons get only first .. place 
finish in 400 freestyle relay 

By DANIEL DIAl 
Contributing Writer 

In a battle of conference giants, 
UCSD women's sWim fell short of 
a victory, losing an away game ,0 
USD 168- 126 on Feb, I. The 
Triton racked up some strong 
individual performances, but only 
managed one fir t-place finish all 
afternoon. 

"I thought we performed well 
today," said UCSD head coach 
ScOtt McGihon about hi team's 
performance. "But USD was 
ready for us ." 

The 10 s btings the Tritons ' 
record to 4-3 this season. 

The lone UC 0 victory came 
in the final event of the meet: the 
400-yard freestyle relay. The 
Triton relay team, anchored by 
senior Samantha Wong, outpaced 
the Torero relay team and finished 
with a time of 3:3 .21.. The victo-
ry brought some solace to the 
UCSD sWimmers in a meet that 
has produced the last four confer-
ence champions, rwo titles for 
each squad. 

The shortage of victories did 
not put a damper on UC D 's day 
becau e each swimmer gave a solid 
performance, notably sophomore 
Chnstine Hyjek. Hyjek wreaked 
her own havoc in the meet, swim-
nung 2: 10. 15 in the 200 butterfly, 
a new personaJ best. She also had a 
strong showing in the 200 individ-
ual medley, finishing a close sec-
ond in both races. 

"It was pretty cool," Hyjek said 
about her finishes. "I stepped up 
and] did great." 

Coach McGihon also 
remarked about Hyjek's perfor-
mance. 

"She had a vcry good meet -
definitely great," he said. 

The team al 0 had close finish-
es throughou t the afternoon, 
adding six other individual and 
relay second-place finishes to 
Hyjek's deuce. Sophomore 
Ro anna Delurgio took rwo ec-
ond-place finishes in the 100- and 
2oo-yard breaststroke with time 
of 1:04, 7 and 2:23.64, respective-
ly. Sophomore Frances Tran had a 
time of 2: 13 .86 in the 2oo-yard 
backstroke - good enough for 
another UC D second-place fin-
ish. 

UCSD's lack of rest may have 
played a crucial factor in the out-
come of the meet. The Tritons 
came into the meet only a week 
after defeating UC Santa Cruz In 
their last home meet, while USD 
had a full rwo weeks to rest and 
recover. 

"USD's extra rest definitely 
gave them an edge," Hyjek said. 

The UCSD sWimmers were 
al 0 without the aid of super 
junior Jennifer Watanabe, who 
was absent from the meet due to 
personal reasons. 

Even with the heartbreaking 
loss, the women's swim team is 
looking forward to defending its 
title at the Pacific Collegiate 

wimming Conference 
Championships later this month. 

uWe have strong depth and we 
have been working hard," Hyjek 
said about her teammates' prepa-
ration for the upcoming meet. 

Baseball: Crusaders take 
3--0 victory in pitcher's duel 

conunued from page 16 
up, it went out. Unfonunarely, 
[the gameJ came down to three 
pitches today." 

Though Point Lorna came out 
on top and hit three home runs, 
the g2me was a pitcher's duel. The 
Trirons notched just three runs on 
three hits, and the Crusaders 
recorded just five runs on five hits 
In the nine-inning rnatch up. 

Provicbng a pitcher's perspec-
tive, Bergstrom said that the 
Crus:lde~ knew how to work the 
ball around the comers of the plate. 

"Their pitchers used the 
umpire's strike zone to their advan-
tage," he said. "They were getting 
some calls ilia t were six to seven 
inches off the plate, but sometimes 
ilia rs how the g2Il1e goes." 

Point Lorna led 3-0 through 
seven innings on home runs from 
first baseman Adam McGrew and 
righl fielder RV1n Hoover. 
However, UCSD came alive in the 
eighth, scoring three runs and 
putting pressure on the Crusaders. 

Though not his night to throw 
in the rotation, Triron pitcher 
Andy Holloway commented on 
the play of hls team. 

"We dld a good job battling 
back when we tied It and scored 
three runs 10 the eighth," 
J lolloway said. UWe had a chance 
to take the lead, uut It was tough 
that they beat us on JUSt three 
swings of the bat. It IS cruCial that 
we bear down on every pitch, and 
today was a perfeCt elGlmple of how 
the game can change on iu~t one 
pitch." 

UCSD freshman pitcher Jose 
Navarro (0-1) recorded the loss 
for the Tritons after relieving 
Bergstrom in the sixth inning. 

"Jose [NavarroJ had a lot of 
composure on the mound today," 
Holloway said. "Especially as a 
freshman coming into the siruation 
tha t he did, he pi tched very well." 

Triton left fielder John 
801 ogna , designated hitter Brett 
Bunon and second baseman Nigel 
MiJler had the only three hi ts for 
UCSD. For Point Lorna, Vericker 
and Hoover each had home runs, 
McGrew went 2-4 with a home 
run, and second baseman Ralphie 
Marin also had a hit. 

This early in the season, the 
Tri tons are still working out some 
kinks in their play. 

"We need to be more consistent 
in both pitching and hitting," 
Bergstrom said. "In the few g2Il1es 
we've played, it has been one or the 
other. We've got to get better at 
putting both together and as the 
season continues, we will ." 

UCSD squares off against 
POlOt Loma again on Feb. 7 at 2 
p.m . at hOlTle, and is confident 
that the outcome of that galne 
will be different. 

.. \Ne are gOing to come out on 
lOp," Berg~trom said . "Alex 
[Cremldanj is starting, and it's a 
whole different game al our field . 
1 know our bats will come alive, 
and we'll playa strong game." 

The -Imons continue thclr 
nonconfercnce action against 
Cahfornla Baptist in a double-
header on Feb. Il . 

AnN MacMuldo/GoorcOOn file phoIo 
Closely behind: Although UCSD had only one first-place time, the team had six 
second-place finishes, induding one by Frances Tran in the 200-yard backstroke. 

"Even with the loss, we still have 
great confidence." 

The day's events began on a 
higher note with the UCSD girls 
taking first place in both diving 
events. The 200-yard medley 
relay kicked off the swim portion 
of the meet and featured a hotly 
contested battle between the 

UCSD and USD A teams. In the 
end, UCSD finished second with 
a time of I :5 1.3 I , almo t three 
seconds behind USD's winning 
rime of I :48.90 . The result was 
only a sign of things to come, 
since UCSD failed to capture a 
single event for most of the after-
noon . 

Water polo: UCSD looks 
forward to home tournament 

contin ued from page 16 
eight of 12 opponents' shots. The 
freshman Foe led the team with 
six saves. 

The Tritons are a veteran 
team this season with all four of 
their leading scorers being 
seniors. They also have seven 
seniors and seven juniors among 
their 26-player roster. They 
know the schedule will get 
tougher than this as the season 
progresses. They will play tough 
clubs, such as the University of 
Michigan , on Feb. 7, and then 
host teams like UC Santa 
Barbara and rival Loyola 
Marymount University in the 
UC San Diego Arena 

Invitational this weekend. 
"It should be a good tourna-

ment. There are lot of good teams 
coming in," Sanders said. 

UCSD finished last season 
nnked No. 12 nationally, and if 
it wins the Women's Western 
Water Polo Association 
Championship in April, the team 
will g2in an automatic berth to 
the National Collegiate Athletic 
Association C hampionships in 
May. 

As evidenced by the Tritons' 
solid play this weekend and the 
experience of their players, get-
ting to the NCAA 
Championships could be a realis-
tic goal.

he didn't actually know what was 
going on, has been the only thing 
that has been able to reduce his 
suspension. 

If an athlete, albeit a high 
school athlete, is going to welcome 
stardom when it comes his way, he 
and the people around him have a 
responsibility to know the rules 
and abide by them. 

"If 1 had known I was violating 
anything, I would've never done it. 
I would've never jeopardized my 
eligibi lity. I would 've never jeopar-
dized my team," James said. 

He should have known. Simply 
by not knowing, James did jeopar-
dize all those things. It was his 
responsibility, and he couldn't han-
dJe it. 

His mom could get a loan 10 
buy a Hummer. Maybe James and 
his "support group" need to see if 
they can get a low-interest loan and 
buy themselves a clue.

WOMEN'S RUGBY 
Whcn searching for words to 

describe this year's UCSD women's 
rugby team, "talented" and "ski ll -
ful" tend [0 come to mind . 
I [owever, after this past weekend's 
staggering win over Occidental, 
another word can be added : "ruth-
less." 

The final score was 81-0. Some 
may attribute the win to the per-
formances exhibited by all of the 
rookies. Others note the team's 
standout players, including Tori 
Gargiso, Jenny Triplett and Jill

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

CLUB SPORTS 
MEN'S RUGBY 

UCSD men's rugby fell [0 1-3 
in league play following a tough 
loss to USD on Feb. I by the score 
of 36-27. 

After controlling the first few 
minutes of the match, a costly 
turnover by the Tritons resulted in 
the first try of the day by USD, giv-
ing the Torreros the lead at 5-0. 
Only five minutes later, more 
UCSD lapses resulted in the sec-
ond try of the day by USD that 
gave it the lead 10-0. 

Following a penalty kick by 
Triton winger Kevin I Iannigan, 
USD continued to assert control of 
the game with rwo more convened 
tries to finish the first half with a 
24-3 lead. 

Fortunately for the Tritons, 
the second half started out differ-
ently than the first . Re-encrgized, 
the Tritons starred quickly with 
UCSD f1yhaJf Mike Meissner 
scoring the first try of the day. 
After another Hannigan conver-
sion, UC 0 brought the score 10 
24- 10. 

USD answered with twO more 
tries of its own to pull ahead 36-

10 before the Tritons 
got back on track. 
UCSD flanker Josh 
Mello and winger Nick 
Polsky both scored tries in 
the seco nd half (both con-
verted by Hannigan), but it 
was too little, toO late, since 
the late charge was not 
enough to compensate for the 
lackluster first-half perfor-
mance, and UCSD fell 36-27. 

"We were unfortunate to 
have started the day so slowly," 
said UCSD head coach Tim 
0'1 lara. "We saw how good we 
could be in the second half, but 
it wasn't enough to make up for 
the poor showing in the first 
half." 

The UCSD "8" side improved 
its record to 4-0 following its 19-
7 victory in the day's second 
match. 

EQUESTRIAN 
The UCSD equestrian team 

hosted a compctltion at Clark's 
Ranch on Feb. I and Feb. 2. The

Prep star 
crosses too 
far over the 
thinning line 

o Knows 
Owen Main 

T he Ohio State Athletic Association deemed prep star LeBron james ineligi-
ble for the rest of hi senior season 
on Jan. 31 because he accepted two 
throwback jerseys from a clothing 
store In Cleveland, OhiCl. 

The kId's got a Hummer 
(wh Ich hIS unemployed single 
mother gOt a loan to buy), boxe 
of free shoes and apparel, and he' 
already been on national televI-
sion more then once during this, 
his semor sea on, at SI. Vincent-

t. Mary High School In Ohio. 
People in Ohio even pay $7 to see 
hIS games on pay-per-view. 
Everyone around him wears shirts 
that say "KingJames." ow "King 
James" will have to w3!t for the 
NBA to display his ba ketball roy-
alty again . 

Bummer. The 18-year-old kid, 
who has been the tool of television 
stations, newspapers and all media 
outlets Imaginable, couldn't take It. 
The man-cluld who' been strad-
dltng the tenuous line between 
amateur and professional all season 
finally fell a little too far away from 
the amateur side than the OH AA 
could allow. 

What amazes me IS the way peo-
ple seem to be blarmng everybody 
but James. People are actually upset 
that the rullOg came down the way 
It dId. 

But how could thIS have ended 
up any other way? As hIS stardom 
rose and his sense of reahty went 
the way of all thmgs, there was 
nobody there to bring hIm back to 
reality. obody there to ay, "Hey 
LeBron, why don't you wait until 
the season's over to pick up that 
Hummer or those jerseys." 

His mother certainly didn't do 
anythmg to curb what james beat 
writer Susan Vinella called an 
"atmosphere of entitlement" when 
she got a loan and bought him a 
$50,000 car that made his profile 
even hIgher. 

And the rest of James' support 
system (is there any other support 
sys tem ') apparently hasn't been 
much bener. 

"We get celebntles 10 here all 
the lime," said Derrick Craig, the 
manager of the clothing store that 
gave James the Infamous Jerseys. 
"They spend a lot of money, and 

~omeume you JUSt got to gl vc 
them ~()mc love ." 

That "love" could have COSt 
jamc. the rest of hIS hIgh .thool 
career. 

But you can't convmcc mc that 
jdmc~ ~asn 't aware of the rules or 
that hc JUSt dIdn 't know he was 
dOIng ,omethlng wrong. If he was-
n't aware, then !l 'S a damn shame, 
and he's a dalnn fool. 

"l ie knew what was gOing on,"
