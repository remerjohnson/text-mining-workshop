Angela Oh 
Speaks to 
Students 
DIVERSITY: Clinton appointee 
discusses her studies on race 
relations in the United States 

A committee is currently 
accepting proposals to develop a 

93 acre hotel site north of campus 

By Jeffrey M. Barker 
Senior Staff Writer 

The university announced plans late last night 
to build a hotel and confere.nce center on a long-
dormant parcel of north campus. The university is 
currently requesting bids from outside developers. 

By Jennifer Grady 
Staff Writer 

Angela Oh, an appointee to President 
Clinton's Advi sory Board on Race, deliv-
ered a lecture on Monday concerning her 
studies on race relations in the United 
States. 

A hotel was first proposed for the universi-
ty property in the mid- 1980s. Nancy Kossan, 

director of UCSD's real estate development, said 
the original proposal was never constructed due 

to "a general downturn in the 
national economy." 

The parcel of land, which 
lies at the comer of North Torrey 

Pines and Salk Institute roads, is 
approximately 9.5 acres. It has 

remained unused since the university 
took owner hip in 196'. A committee 

was appointed last spring to recommend a 
usage for the land. 

Vice Chancellor of Development and External 
Relations James Langley said the best use for the 
land would provide revenue for the university 
and would benefit the overall academic environ-
ment of UCSD. 

The committee, which consists of approxi-
mately 15 members in a joint effort of the admin-
istration and the Academic Senate, decided on a 
hotel/conference center. No tudents were named 
to the committee. Faculty housing and research 
and development spac'e were other options con-
sidered for the land. 

Kossan said that ideal planned center would 
offer benefits to the entire UCSD community. 

"We're looking for the kinds of proposals that 
would offer favorable rates - for students and 
faculty - [and] would offer priority booking for 
the conference facilities," Kossan said. 

She added that student employment possibili-

The Advisory Board on Race was creat-
ed as part of Clinton 's Initiative on Race, 
which was introduced by the president at 
UCSD's 1997 all-campus commencement. 
The advisory board allocates resources 
toward healing the legacy of racism in the 
United States and attempts to "bridge" racial 
divides. The advisory board consists of 
some of the nation's most distinguished 
activists, historians and social scientists. 

Oh, a former attorney, is currently a vis-
iting scholar, lecturer and lawyer-i n-resi-
dence at UCLA. She is also a writer, and her 
most recent essay, "Moving Beyond Self-
Interest," is part of a book titled True to 
Ourselves - A Celebration of Wom en 
Making a Difference. 

A second-generation Korean, Oh said she 
grew up in Los Angeles during a time when 
the youth of her generation were ques(ion-
ing authority. Oh said she has been interest-
ed in civi l rights, women 's rights and gov-
ernment investigations ever since her 
involvement in the protests against 
apartheid in South Africa. 

She has been involved in many organiza-
tions, including her current position as a 
commissioner on the Lo Angeles City 
Human Relations Commission. 

As a member of Clinton's Advisory 
Board on Race, Oh and the other members

Endowed Chair to Honor Biology Professor 
EDUCATION: Ceremony will honor Paul Saltman for his efforts in promoting teaching and learning of science 
By Marjorie Montemayor 
Staff Writer 

A ceremony will be held at 
UCSD on June 7 to formally 
announce the newly established 
Paul D. Sallman Chair in Science 
Education. The endowed chair hon-
ors Paul Sallman, a UCSD profes-
sor of biology, for his effons in 
promoting teaching and the leam-

ing of science within both the uni-
versity and the general community. 

The committee responsible for 
the chair's creation included Stuart 
Brody, professor of biology; Mary 
Walshok, associate vice chancellor 
of university extension; Thomas 
Bond, Revelle college provost; and 
retired lawyer Milton Fredman. 
The group collaborated on the idea 

of creating a chair that 'would con-
tinue Saltman's science education 
legacy. 

"It was my idea to honor him 
and his works and also to carry on 
the work," Brody said. "So that 
when he retires, there will be some-
one continuing to do the work in 
science education from UCSD." 

The endowment will be funded 

by a number of donors from the 
UC system and members of the 
community. The UCSD 
Foundation will hold and inve t the 
endowment. 

The recipient oflhe chair will be 
a senior member of the UCSD biol-
ogy facully who demonstrates 
Saltman's ideals in science teach-

Ihat it go toward student housing," 
Patterson said. 

As of yet. students have not been 
involved in the decision-making 
process conceming the parcel of land. 

Ryan Olson, a Marshall junior, 
said he was the only student pre-
ent at the Monday meeting to dis-

cuss the project. 
"There was a representative from _ 

Blackhorse Farms, from La Jolla 
Farms. a representative from the 
Salk Institute, representatives from 
Ihe adminislration." Olson said. 

He added that he is attending the 
meetings to ensure that the sludents 
have'a voice in the hotel decisions. 

The land is adjacent to 
Blackhorse Farms, a 121 -unit 
development of townhouses also on 
UCSD property. The university'S 
preliminary report on the land states 
that recent sales of Blackhorse 
Farms townhouses have ranged 

coveries about American attitudes. 
"As I talked to people around 

the country, I was impressed over 
and over again by the number of 
really decent people out there," Oh 
said. '1'here are so many people 
trying to find a way to make things 
work. They aren't filled with 
hate." 

Although progress is being 
made, Oh said that issues of racism 
in this country have not come to a 
close, and that maybe they never 
will. She said she believes that 
"reasonable raci~m" still exists. 

Oh said this form of bigotry and 
prejudice is "rational and justified" 
by one's environment. She also 
said that social groups and 6O-sec-
ond news blurbs create certain 
ideas about different groups. and 
that as a result, certain stigmas are 
perceived as the norm. 

Oh said that one way to under-

graduate students. He also said that 
the chair holder should promote 
science among non-biology majors 
and others outside the field through 
communication outlets such as 
public broadcasting and science lit-
eracy. 

Sahman said he stresses the 
importance of educating not only 
students, but teachers as well. He 
said that educating elementary and 
secondary science teachers is vital 
to the communication of the sci-
ences. 

The UCSD Guardian 

from $400,000 to $600,000. 
The university's report said thai 

the original development plan was 
for a Ritz Carlton hotel with 210 
hotel rooms and 15.300 square feet 
of conference space. The plan also 
included a 7,488 square fOOl ball-
room, a health club, a swimming 
pool and spa and three tennis courts. 

Kossan said the committee will 
choose a proposal that is more geared 
toward an academic environment. 

Out ide developers must submit 
proposals by June 25. Kossan said 
that one will be chosen in August. 

Kossan said that the developer 
will ground lease the land in order to 
build the facility without using uni-
versity funds. Similarly, the land 
under the San Diego Supercomputer 
Center was originally leased to Ihe 
government, which paid for the con-
struction of the facility. Ownership 
has since been returned to UCSD. 

stand the issue is "to hear what is 
not said and to see what cannot be 
seen and to know what is unknow-
able." 

She added that visionary leaders 
and others have long practiced this 
way of understanding. and that it is 
essential to the politics of a nation 
with so many diverse regions. 

Oh said that while votes in Los 
Angeles county go to "symbols for 
representation" [racial diversity], 
she believes that people of color do 
look for substance in a candidate as 
well. 

She added that candidates who 
possess the capacity to balance the 
reality of color-consciousness and 
principles beyond color will be the 
winners. Oh said that ideal candi -
date will recognize that people of 
all races and ethnicities want job 
security, safe schools for their chil-
dren and accessible health care. 

Sallman also said that he thinks 
the recipient of the chair should 
have a focus on the link between 
teaching and learning. 

"One must be com milled to 
teaching and learning - that's the 
key," Salt man said. "You have to 
be involved in the existential 
demands of beipg a fine scholar 
and knowledgeable human being 
and a creative person committed to 
manifesting these traits. And the 
second piece is to share it with oth-
ers."

The 'Force' Grips American 
Audiences a Uttle Too Hard 

Tickets went on sale Wednesday at noon for what 
is shaping up to be the movie event of the century. 
The excitement and hysteria that are apparent in 
cities all over North America clearly indicate that 
"Star Wars" fever is officially back in style. 

Out in front of the Mann 's Chinese Theater in 
Hollywood, Calif., people lined up weeks in advance 
to ensure that they had the opportunity to secure 
opening-day tickets. They documented their experi-
ence on line at http://starwars.countingdown. com/ 
and continue to update the site as they wait to see 
what is quite possibly the most anticipated movie of 
the century. 

They came in costume and they came prepared. 
Some of the die-hard fans brought toys , some 
brought books, some even brought televisions and 
VCRs equipped, of course, with "Star Wars" videos. 
Most, however, brought sleeping bags and pillows. 

They ' re not alone. 
In the Mi ss ion Valley shopping mall just off 

Highway 8 in San Diego, a fellow going by the name 
of "ledi losh" camped out in front of the AMC 
Mission Valley 20 theaters for weeks. In the time he 
spent there, "ledi losh" became popular through 
endorsement by a local radio station and had his stay 
made dramatically more comfortable by donations

UNIONIZATION WILL DAMAGE 
.GRADUATE ENVIRONMENT 

COMMENTARY: 
History proves that 
graduates should not 
vote for unionization 
By David Sworcier 
SpeciiJl to the Guardian 

In a surprisingly short time, UCSD 
has created a very productive environ-
ment for teaching and research. This 
has been a joint effort of the faculty 
and the graduate students. The success 
of this institution illustrates how a 
common purpose can be achieved with 
dose cooperation. 

Next week, TAs at UCSD will vote 
to determine if the Association of 
Student Employees, a local arm of the 
United Auto Workers (the 
ASEIUAW), will become a partner in 
this endeavor. Unless the majority of 
th1 TAs vote "no representation," the 
UAW will become the exclusive bar-
gaining agent for TAs, readers and 
tutors at UCSD. 

Unfortunately, a rev iew of the 
proposed collective bargaining 
agreements leads to the condusion 
that the delicate mentoring relation-
ship that exists between the students 
and the faculty is harmed by the 
interj ection of a uni on-university 
bureaucracy. 

Although the UAW seeks to dif-
ferentiate between support mailers 
and academic concerns, stating t~at 
co llec ti ve bargaining would take 
place in a "wholly separate arena 
from Ihe private ... mentoring rela-
lionships," this has proven to be 
impossible at other research institu-
tions. The two arenas arc so inter-
t wined that separalion is both super-
ficial and artificia l. 

As the ex isting collecti ve bargai n-
ing agreement · show, when faced 
with the inseparabi lity of academic 
undertakings, Ihe union leadership 
will respond by applying, inappropri-

ately, old nostrums in a new environ-
ment. They treat students as inter-
changeabt'e, and view educational 
tasks in the context of industrial para-
digms. 

The definitions of traditional bar-
gaini ng terms are stret\.:hed beyond 
reason to justify thei r use in the envi-
ronment of a modern research univer-
sity. The resulting codi fi cation of strkt 
work rules, seniority, grievance to 
arbitration, etc. would strike at the 
heart of "shared governance" at 
UCSD. 

UCSD has \.:ollective bargaining 

agreements with several campus 
unions. Both instructional and non-
instructional groups are represented. 

For example, people with the title 
"Lecturer" have course responsibility 
and are part of a systemwide bargain-
ing unit. For organized workers, a 
union provides a centralized voice in 
the university, and through bargaining, 
unit members have achieved uniform 
working conditions and grievance pro-
cedures. 

The advantages of unionization for 
students in a modern research univer-
si ty are more problematic. 

Individual students work with indi-
vidual faculty members on individual-
ized educational actlvllles. 
Excellence, not uniformity, is expect-
ed from this collaboration. Instead of 
broad ski II categories, each student 
brings his own particular aptitude to 
joint undertakings. The university 
administration is neither centralized 
nor remote. 

When the UAW proposes contracts 
for students that are like those negoti-
ated with large industrial businesses, it 
makes clear that the UAW representa-
tives have lillIe appreciation for how 
the activities of a research universi ty 
are organized. 

Unions have a strong financial 
incentive to organize student assis-
tants. Nationwide, the number of RAs, 
TAs, readers and tutors is of the same 
magnitude as the 200,000 members 
that the UAW has lost over the past 
decade. However, graduate students 
must ask, "Will afl1liation with an 
industrial union improve the academ-
ic environment in my own institu-
tion'!" 

Experience with bargaining on 
other campuses is not positive. There 
is no indication that unionized cam-
puses have higher stipends. 
Individual students lose the right to 
guide the process of their individual

grievances - the union may pur-
sue (or settle) a grievance on 
behalf of a student without the stu-
dent 's consent. 

The curre nt effort hy the 
ASEIUAW 10 organi ze TAs tries 10 
appear benign. and the union refus-
es to articulate its detailed plans. 
However. the colle\.:live bargaining 
agreements at other universities 
show the risks to the studenls and 
faculty from acquiescing to union 
pressure. 

AI the Uni versity of Wisconsin, 
for example, arbi tration has been 
used as a vehicle for placing the 
union's authority on a par with thai 
of the faculty in setting up edUl:a-
tional programs. At the same time, 
the salaries ofTAs (who arc union-
ized) have fallen significa ntl y 
behind those of RAs (who arc not 
unionized). 

With tight budgets, and a diffi-
cult funding environment, this is 
not the time to introduce an 
increase in the bureaucratization of 
UCSD with little prospect of e\.:O-
nomi\.: or academic gain. 

The faculty, the researchers, the 
departmental staff and the adminis-
tration si mply do not have the time 
to devote to formal hearings con-
cerning selection of TAs. course 
sizes, posting procedures, seniority 
in reappointment, adjustment in 
appointment level necessi tated hy 
funding \.:hanges. etc. Any increase 
in nonessential work must be pre-
vented before il becomes institu-
tionalized. 

UC Berkeley has been bargain-
ing with the UAW over readers and 
tutors for over live years. Many 
other campus unions have agreed 
upon contracts during this period 
(some more than once), hut of the 
over 40 issues that were introduced 
initially into bargai ning, very few 
have been resolved. 

For example, the UAW propos-
es that the precise duties of each 
represented position must be made 
ex plicit as long as three months 
before the start of \.:lasses. Task 
delineation would include the por-
tion of time to be spent on paper 
grading, in office hours, in atten-
dance in class, etc. Should the fa\.:-
ully member responsible for the 
dass later decide to insert a 
midterm. the UAW would have to 
approve any reallo\.:ation of a read-
er's time. 

Such bureau\.:ratic rigidity 
would prevent the instructor from 
adapting the dass to the progress of 
the students with untoward effect 
on undergraduate education. 

Many of the issues raised by the 
UAW are related to matters that 
impact the academic process 
directly. The consequences of a 
collective bargaining agreement at 
UCSD are d ear. 

A faculty-union-administration 
body meets to determine things that 
are now in the domain of the facul-
ty and the department. Student-fac-
ulty apprenticeships arc replaced 
with a formal labor-management 
relationship. 

To imagine that a collective bar-
gaining agreement would not 
change the atmosphere at UCSD is 
to refuse to acknowledge the events 
in the last 25 years of faculty-stu-
dent union interaction and the dear 
wording of the \.:olle\.:tive bargain-
ing agreements currently in force. 

It is to the advantage of both the

students and the faculty of a 
research university to work 
together to improve the climate 
for inquiry. This is a job that 
never truly ends, but with joint 
effort, the task can be made eas-
:er. 

jt;.;> . SIVP "fil ul ' ~ BERTRAND 
. AN 

With the rush and excitement of 
the Sun God Festival, it is easy to 
overlook the important values and 
morals that we have cherished for 
so many years. 

However, I think that one thing 
10 which we should pay close atten-
tion is the idea of abstinence. 

Many adults don't express the 
importance of abstinence very well 
- they usually use vague phrases 
like "you' re too young" or "you' re 
not ready." Few actually stress the 
dangers involved in premature sex-
ual involvement. 

When asked about this topic, 
students are quick to answer with 
phrases like, "If you ' re not going to 
do it now, when the hell are you 
going to do itT' But one shouldn 't 
have sex simply because one feels 
that everyone else is doing it. 

The point of the matter is that 
not everyone is as promiscuous as 
the media would like you to 
believe. The emotional conse-
quences are a bit more difficult to 
see than the physical ones. 

Sex puts an unnecessary strain 
on a relationship; both parties 
sometimes feel . uncomfortable 
around each other after they have 
had sex. Females commonly con-
sent to having sex because they 

are afraid of losing their 
boyfriends. But this isn 't a rational 
belief; if a man truly loves hi s gi rl -
friend , sex will play an insignifi -
cant role in the larger scheme of 
things. 

Abstinence is a powerful tool in 
life. It separates us from some of the 
many dangers in the world. We 
shouldn't limit its application simply 
to sexual promiscuity - there are 
other realms for its use. 

th.: consumption of coffee and soft 
drinks. 

Many people trivi ali ze the 
effects that caffeine can have on a 
person. Caffeine is a drug, just like 
any other. It can put an individual 
in a state where he or she is unablc 
to study or sleep. It can also seri-
ously affect one's progress in 
class. 

Another assumption people 
make is that ordinary products, 

Alcohol is 
a good 
example of 
thi s. There 
are few col-

such as 
milk, can-
not be detri-
mental to 
your health. 
This is far lege students 

who abstain from the use of alco-
hol, despite the fact that everyone 
knows the problems that can arise 
from using it. Alcohol causes peo-
ple to act irresponsibly, to do things 
that they would ordinarily never 
do. When someone is under the 
influence, they can hurt people in 
ways that they would never imag-
ine. 

Many people consume great 
deals of alcohol, up to the point 
where they endanger their health 
because they overestimate their 
limits. By simply abstaining from 
its consumption altogether. we can 
prevent all of these potential disas-
ters. 

Drinking, per se, can be catego-
rized as a peri lous form of behav-
ior. We should ' abstain entirely 
from all unnecessary drinking, like 

from true. Expired milk can cause 
serious illnesses, such as indiges-
tion and stomach aches. Also, if 
stored at the wrong temperature, 
milk can go bad even before the 
expiration date comes around. The 
safest way to drink milk is to not 
drink it II all. 

A few glasses of water will suf-
fice for an entire day, but even this 
should be avoided if at all possible. 
Moderation is important. It is pos-
sible to drink enough water to the 
point where your bladder actually 
explodes, causing internal bleed-
ing. and possibly death. 

This is not to say that liquids are 
the only dangerous substances that 

.can be taken orally. For many 
y~an the surJeon general has

other items available at our local 
cafeterias. As a matter of fact , there 
are even some mushrooms that can 
cause hallucinogenic effects for 
small amounts of time. 

The solution is simple 
bread. Bread provides the basic 
nutrients needed to lead a normal 
life, as long as the loaf is con-
sumed quickly. One should pur-
chase six or seven loaves a week 
and replace them regularly. Again, 
moderation is important, as obesi -
ty is a growing problem in the 
United States. 

The one thing above all that 
college students disregard com-
pletely is the sun. With the deple-
tion of the ozone layer, harmful 
ultra-violet rays can reach our skin 
and cause all sorts of problems. 
ranging from chapped lips to skin 
cancer. 

Wearing hats and applying sun-
screen are precautions that reduce 
the chances of skin cancer, but 
they are simply not enough. 
Abstinence from the sun is the best 
way to avoid skin cancer. Many 
people ask, "How is this possible?" 
It's simple - by staying in your 
room. . 

In conclusion, by staying in 
your room all day, drinking water 
and eating bread, refraining from 
sexual activity or consuming alco-
hol, you will lead a safe and pro-
ductive life.

The inclusion of extra-uni-
versity groups in the education-
al activities of this institution 
will inevitably impede the cre-
ative work that we seek to do 
and wi II degrade the intellectual 
environment that drew the stu-
dents and faculty to UCSD in 
the first place. 

Would having the UAW 
speak for students enrich their 
educational experience? 

For most students, it would 
not. The prospect of collective 
bargaining with a large industri-
al union serving as the exclu-
sive bargaining agent for stu-
dents at UCSD should be a con-
cern for all of us in the univer-
sity community. The adv.:rsari -
al nature of collective bargain-
ing will inevitably make it more 
difficult to preserve the colle-
gial environment so essential to 
high-quality graduate educa-
tion.

CAMPUS SIGNS WASTE FEES 
Editor: 

While riding the North Parking 
Shuttle this morning from some-
where in Los Angeles County, I 
noticed a work crew installing the 
plaques on the new system of cam-
pus directory signs. 

I was outragc:d at the obvious 
waste of university funds. These 
signs are absolutely unnecessary 
for anyone who has been on cam-
pus for more than live minutes. 

Nothing that is printed on these 
expensive signs could not be print-
ed just as easily on a 2-cerit paper 
map. What upsets me the most is 
the fact that these signs are intend-
ed primarily to 'benelit new and 
prospective students, as well as vis-
itors. 

This campus already receives 
many more applications from qual-
ified prospective students that it 
(;()uld possibly admit , so why 
expend student money to attract 
more'! 

Furthermore, the current stu-
dent body has many more pressing 
problems to worry about than 
these supertluous and useless 
campus directory signs. For exam-
ple, the parking situation is only 
getting worse, and housing is 
harder to lind than a four leaf 
clover. 

On a campus where textbooks 
are outrageously marked up and 
the dining halls serve $2 meals for

Cloning and Genetic 
'estlng Is Nece_ry 
Editor: 

I read both articles of 
Monday's pro/con with interest, 
yet found little value in either 
("Cloning's Consequences," May 
10). We can ' t avoid research being 
done on genetics. Burying our 
heads in the sand to avoid discov-
ering the key to human cloning is 
moronic , a,s is denying or misrep-
resenting the obvious benefits of 
such technology. 

Supporting research into such 
studies without reason is equally 
idiotic wilhout careful thought into 
the obvious misuses of such a tech-
nology. The fact of the matter is 
this: People will figure out how. 

Let's regulate the potential mis-
uses as best we can, while allowing 
ourselves the benefits. 

Figuring out how to do this 
isn 't easy. But why should it be? 
As for the charge that cloning is 
"playing God": All I can say, as a 
Christian, is that the suggestion 
lhat humans are even capable of 
such an act , even when made by 
so-called religious leaders, bor-
ders on heresy. 

The ability to clone a human 
being is insignificant compared to 
the power of the God told of in the 
Bible, Koran and Tor-Ih .

Pimp Symphony. a UCSD favorite. continue their wave of success by opening for the Sun God festival 
By Eric OllOn 
Staff Writer 

Draped in go ld chai ns and 
leather jackets, the Pimp Sym-
phony take to the stage wi th an 
ex plo ion of guitar noise and 
Mariachi -li ke screams. The 
drums kick in with a fu nk beat 
fo llowed by a quick ska guit ar 
line. The two horn players blast 
over the top and Pimp Symphony 
is in fu ll effec t. 

Since opening for Buck 0 ' 
Nine at a 1997 UCSD TG, the 
Pimp Symphony has become a 
major musica l force in San 
Diego, playing at local venues 
li ke Moondoggies, Burralo Joe's, 
Papa Jacks and Schooner's. Two 
weeks ago the band won the 
UCSD batt le of the bands and 
will open for Reel Big Fi 'h and 
Cypre 's Hill at thi s year's Sun 
God Festival.

This year's headlining Sun God band. Cypress Hill. light up the stage with their smoking grooves 
By Sky Froetenson 
Staff Writer 

It 's the DEA's worst nightmare! 
They 've rocked crowds at Lolla-
palooza '95 and the Smokin ' 
Grooves tour. They've been the 
subject of countless government 
censorship debates and kept it as 
true as any group could ever hope 
to. Now the extra-prolific hip-hop 
group known as Cypress Hill is set 
to blaze up the stage Friday night 
(pun intended), headlining for Sun 
God '99. Be prepared, because you 
might find that it 's a lillie' harder 
than normal to "just say no" at this 
show. 

Let 's take it back to the old 
school, just for a second. In the 
early nineties, something the 
media affectionately termed 
"gangsta rap" was making head-
lines left and right. Mothers and 
religious officials nationwide were 
horrified to think that these images 
of urban reality might somehow 
make it into the bedrooms of their 
uburban youth, but it seemed the 

fad was passing. Just when they 
thought it was safe to let their kids 
have their Walkmans back, a Los 
Angeles-based group named 
Cypress Hill burst onto the main-
stream scene, thanks to the popu-
larity of an early b-side recording 
titled "How I Could Just Kill a 
Man." The group's hard-core rap-
ping style and pro-hemp message 
quickly became an instant hit 
among teenagers, and politicians 

quickly realized it was time for 
more legislation to ensure the 
safety of America's young, 
impressionable minds. This mis-
guided attempt backfired, of 
course, and Cypress Hill's self-
titled debut album went on to sell 
almost two million copies in the 
U.S., breaking into the Top 40 and 
earning the group the "Hot Rap 
Single's" nod at the Billboard 
Music Awards in December of 
1992. Obviously, this was just the 
beginning. 

The group's popularity is 
largely due to their fresh lyri ca l 
style and infectious beats, 
although Cypress Hill's ardent 
pro-hemp activism keeps the 
group continuously in the lime-
light. Lead rapper B-Real (other-
wise kllown to hi s mother as 
Louis Freese), a Mexican-Cuban 
native of L.A. 's Southgate, pro-
vides the main flow with hi s sto-
rytelling rhymes and trademark 
nasal voice. Havana-born Sennen 
Reyes (Sen Dog) punctuates the 
tracks with husky one-liners, 
while at times carrying entire 
songs with his own Latino MC 
style. Sen Dog took a break in 
1997 to concentrate on his punk-
metal hybrid band SX- IO, but 
returned to Cypress Hill just in 
time to record the group's fourth 
album and join them for their 
third consecutive appearance on 
last summer 's "Smokin ' 
Grooves" tour. Perhaps the most

indispensable member, however, 
is Lawrence Muggerud (OJ 
Muggs), who provides the back-
bone of the Cypress Hill sound 
with his well-known producing 
and DJing. In addition to working 
and performing with the group, 
this Queens native began a sepa-
rate career by masterminding 

House of Pain 's eponymous debut 
album, containing the hit single 
"Jump Around." 

Cypress Hill 's second album, 
Black Sunday. was released in 
1993. This album is responsible for 
launching the group's influential 
horror-core hip-hop image, with hit 
singles suc~ as "Insane in the 

Brain" and "I Ain' t Goin ' Out Like 
That," the latter .complete with 
Black Sabbath samples. The album 
reached unprecedented heights, 
debuting at number one and regis-
tering the highest first week sales 
for any rap album in history up to 
that point.

Senior Staff Writer 

This is it. 
This is my very last Sun God. Let 

the carnage continue one last time. 
Ahh, Sun God. It has given me 

some of the greatest stories of my 
college career. II's the one time of 
year when people like me are cele-
brated on campus. Sun God is MY 
day - the only time when puuing 
down your a-chern book and pick-
ing up an aide English Ice 800 40 
ounce is an acceptable thing. 

Wow, I really have had some 
amazing times in Sun Gods past. 
I'm sure I can't remember half of 
the cool stuff that my friends and I 
did. However. I scoured the tiles 
and came up with a few quick high 
(or perhaps low) lights of the 
debauchery the gut has been a part 
of. 

Freshman Year I: Earlier in the 
year, my suite mates and I stole a 5-
gallon water bottle and created the 
mother of all beer bongs: a four-tube 
monster, complete with stoppers that 
allow you to start and stop the flow 
whenever you want. It was a beauti-
ful thing. On Sun God, we figured 
the only thing to do was to make the 
ultimate in beer bongs: a four-story 
behemoth. We procured a ton of tub-
ing and ran it from our water bottle 
on the fourth story of the N building 
at the Marshall dorms all the way 
down to my friend Bucket's suite. 

Freshmen from all over the land . 
came over to see if the wonderful 
stories they had heard of this magi-
cal invention were true. They were 
not disappointed, although some of 
them were injured. When the beer is 
coming down the tube and you're 
four stories below it, you can hear it 
coming. You're sitting there, wait-
ing for it to hit, but nothing happens. 
Like a waterfall in distance, all you 
can hear is the eerie wash of beer 
gaining momentum. 

Then, just as you were about to 
look up and ask if the beer was 
poured at all it, it hits. All of the 
sudden your cheeks are stretched to 
their limit and you can't swallow

enough beer to ease the tension. 
That night, many freshmen lost 
their lives as they were pounded 
into the ground, knocked off of the 
lube and covered in a pool of Blatz. 
But it was really, really cool. 

Freshman Year II: My very sup-
portive friends thought it would be 
cool if 1 shaved the middle of my 
head. 1 already had a shaved dome, 
but it had grown out about three-
quarters of an inch. I wanted to 
reshave it, but then we all decided 
that it would be funny if I shaved 
only the middle of my head com-

. pletely bald and left the rest of it for 
Sun God.' It was the "Super Old 
Guy" look. In other words, I looked 
like I was 47 years old. True to our 
prediction, it was just about the 
funniest haircut of all time. 

However, Sun God was a sunny 
day (that was back in the day when 
spring quarter in San Diego meant 
good weather) and I knew that I 
needed 10 put a hat on my bald head 
or I would pay the price. Sure 
enough, I got so drunk before I left 
my own freaking suite that I forgot 
the damn hat. During the day, 
though, I thought I was going to get 
away with it because I couldn't feel 
anything. I mean, at all. Anywhere. I 
was basically numb for most of the 
afternoon. So, when I met up with 
some friends, I was shocked to find 
them freaking out at the tomato I

had grown on my head where there 
should have been hair. 

Needless to say, I paid the price. 
However, I did get some unwining 
chick to rub lotion · on my head. 
Sweet. 

Sophomore. Year: Oh, this was 
great... wait. I know I did some-
thing funny sophomore year. I 
remember waking up to some peo-
ple, and they brought over some 
alcohol. Then some more people 
came over and they had some alco-
hol, too. Then we left our apart-
ment. Then we came back. Then 
there lots more people and alcohol. 
Then there was police ... then I 
woke up the next day in my bathtub 
with, well , nevermind. ButI'm sure 
it was outstanding. 

Junior Year: OK, now me and 
the boys didn' t have, a base of oper-
ations on campus. So we convinced 
some hot chicks to let us, you 
know, like, hang out (and drink 
heavily) at their apartment (don' t 
ask me man, some chicks just can't 
help but think guts are auractive). 

This time around, I saw some 
preuy amazing things. I saw my 
roommate elbow his girlfriend in the 
grill to win at the balloon obstacle 
course. I also saw quite a few other 
head injuries at the inflatable boxing 
ring, where my roommates and I, 
who couldn't stand up straight on the 
solid ground. attempted to stand on 
an enormous balloon. Genius. 
Everybody went crashing through 
ring onto their heads on the real 
ground. Did it slow us down? Hell , 
no (for adequate reasoning, refer to 
the shaved head story)! 

After the fun and games, a cou-
ple of my friends and I decided that 
we needed a dip in the pool. So, we 
walked into the Natatorium, took 
our clothes off, and got in the pool. 
We had our boxers on, so we fig-
ured it was OK. Then, we decided 
to relax in the hot tub. It was very 
nice. I can't remember what the 
lifeguards said, but I don't remem-
ber running, so I guess we must 
have said the right thing.

Iguana cemeteries and other hidden facts about our Sun God statue 
By Jesyka Ashlar 
Associate Features Editor 

Reminisce for a moment. Think 
back to your first day on campus. 
Walk up through the eucalyptus 
woods and wonder where the voice 
is coming from and what that blue 
fence is all about. Come out into 
the sun hine and see it for the first 
time. For a moment, be dumbstruck 
before circling to get a clearer view 
of such majesty. Ask the question 

of the ages: "So what's that chick-
en thing supposed to be?" 

Now, of course, all wise stu-
dents know that it 's the Sun God 
and that it 's-part of the Stuart Art 
Collection. Maybe we would ask a 
collective, "Beyond that, who 
cares?" Well, college i all about 
learning things one is deeply con-
vinced qualify as useless. So here 
goes. 

The Stuart Art Collection came 
together in 1982, when the univer-
sity joined forces with the Stuart 
Foundation. 

"As UCSD increases in size and 
stature, so the Stuart Collection 

continues to add provocative new 
works to the landscape, reflecting 
the quality, ideals and spirit of the 
university," UC President and for-
mer Chancellor Richard C. Atkin-
son said, once upon a time. 

Artists are selected for commis-
sion by the Stuart Foundation Advi -
sory Committee, as are the specific 
projects which then go before a 
campus review board. Ultimately, 
the chancellor gives final approval. 
Surprise, surprise, surprise. 

The relevance here is that in 
1983 Niki de Saint Phalle became 
the first Stuart-commissioned artist 
and her Sun God became both her 
first large outdoor work in the Unit-
ed States and the first installment 

of the Stuart Art Collection. 
Not that de Saint Phalle 

would necessarily agree, but 
the Sun God has a smaller sib-

ling in Paris. There is a fountain 
of movi ng sculptures, including a 
lillie bird that looks kind of famil-
iar, that de Saint Phalle collaborat-

,ed on with Swiss artist Jean 
Tinguely by the Centre Pompidou. 
Just think how cultured we must 
be. . 

On a more sober note, the Sun 
God is also a burial site. On a rainy 
night (in La Jolla?) in February of 
1986, Mike Caetano and his fresh-
man roommates buried their 
beloved iguana "Rager," who had 
succumbed to a fatal case of pneu-
monia. For those who would care to 
leave an appropriate remembrance, 
"Rager" is buried under the arch. 

Now, having dispensed with the 
niceties of the history, of the statue, 
let's get down to the business of 
the festival and why we love it. 

In 1983, Henry Chu began this 
annual UCSD tradition with a day 
of festivities that brought together 
otherwise academically inclined 
students. The original festival was 
rained out, but still went on to 
become the most popular of UCSD 
traditions, besides graduation, of 
cour e. 

In 1985, an evening concert was 
added, transforming the festival 
into what it is today. 

Past acts have included Los 
Lobos ( 1985), The Call (1990), The 
Untouchables (1991), Blur (1992), 
Blues Travelers and Gin Blossoms 
(1993), They Might Be Giants and 
No Doubt (1994), The Pharcyde 
and 311 (1995), Rocket from the 
Crypt . and Souls of Mischief 
(1996), De La Soul, Save Ferris 
and Clyde's Ride (1997) and Social 
Distortion and The Roots (1998). 

This year's line up includes, in 
case our careful readers haven't 
already figured it out, a very talent-
ed line up. Cypress Hill , Reel Big 
Fish and Black Eyed Peas are 
accompanied by a home-grown, 
UCSD ska-ish band, Pimp Sym-
phony.

F~m ska-punk to hip-hop, this year's Sun God concert promises to offer up a little b~ for everyone 
By Slant Gee 
Staff Writer 

Not long ago the Huntington 
Beach police paraded handcuffed 
members of Reel Big Fish down 
the middle of Main Street as an 
example of what happens to trou-
blemakers. This was the outcome 
of the first time the band members 
hung out together outside the band. 
"It was kind of cool," recalls trum-
pet player Travis Werts. "Everyone 

that drove past us called the cops 
'Assholes!'" 

As one of Southern California's 
premiere ska-punk bands. Reel Big 
Fish is a frightening example of why 
young children shouldn't drink Jolt 
Cola. Each band member has such a 
consistently high level of energy 
that they could deplete the supply of 
Ritalin. However, they channel this 
energy through ska melodies with 
enough raw, kinetic power to tum a 
club upside down. 

Reel Big Fish will take a break 
from their East Coast tour to play at 
the Sun God Festival, supporting 
their newest album titled Why Do 

They Rock So Hard? 
As with most hyperactive youth, 

Reel Rig Fish pride themselves on 
their sarcasm. These are the type of 
guys who entertained such possible 
band names as the Moisty BUll-
holes and Aaron and the Baritones. 

Though the band once said the 
name originated from a boat attack 
off Catalina Island, they now claim 
it comes from the 1949 edition of 
Rock and Roll Band Names, which 
noted Reel Big Fish as an oddly 
repeated line in several now-classic 
film s. Barrett remarks, "[( 's from 
that famous line at the end of 
'Casablanca', you know, "the prob-
lems of seven small people don 't 
add up to a hill of beans in this reel 

big fi sh." They also claim it 
can be found in Butch Cas-

sidy and the Sundance Kid and 
in Brando's famous "Stella" 
cream when played backwards. 
More likely, the name probably 

renects the band's odd backyard 
keg party origins. Originally a three 
piece band, Barrett, bassist Matt 
Wong and drummer Andrew Gon-
zales were a straight-ahead rock 
band doing Wham!. Warrant, and 
Jimi Hendrix covers. Their goal 
was to cover a different song from 
every musical style possible. Then, 
inspired by ska, Reel Big Fish 
added horn players unti I they 
arrived at their distinctive big 
band-meets-tattered caffeine freak 
sound. Though the original 
turnover for horn players was 
worse than your local McDonald' , 

the band finally gelled with Grant 
Barry and Dan Regan on trombone, 
Werts on trumpet and Scott 
Klopfenstien on trumpet and 
vocals. 

With a solid line-up, 
Reel Big Fish 
r eco rd e d 
their se lf 
re leased 
E ve r y-
thing Sucks 
album in 
1995. It 
became an 
underground hit , 
se lling severa l hun-
dred thousand copies 
and pawning a number-
one hit single on "Radio Free 
Hawaii ." Soon . after, the 
band signed with MOJO 
Records. who quickly got 
them back in the studio. 

Under the direction of 
Oingo Boingo bassist 
John Avila. Reel Big 
Fish recorded a new 
album, Turn the Radio 
Off, which w_as a nuge 
success. Theil )IUUIU 
time included sound 
room mosh-pits, horn 
players recording naked 
and the demolition of a 
toilet they tried to repair 
with superglue and soap. 
What came out of those ses-
sions was an album about 
"being in a band that doesn ' t

Band thrives on

ContInued froIII INC- 11 

Ultimately the album sold 
more than two million copies in 
the U.S. and over three and a 
quarter mi Ilion around the world. 
While promoting the album in an 
appearance on "Saturday Night 
Live," the group made an even 
bigger name for themselves 
through their on-screen antics; 
Muggs sparked a blunt on the air 
while the rest of the crew trashed 
the equipment. While no similar 
incidents occurred during pro-
duction or promotion of their 
third album, Cypress Hill III 
(Temples of Boom) saw simi lar 
success, going platinum despite 
lillie video or airplay. The group 
also conti nued its ongoing fight 
to legalize marijuana by con-
tributing tne Black Sunday track 
" I Wanna Get High" to the HiRh 
Times magazine-sponsored 
HemfJi/ation, the proceeds of 
which went to benefit NORML 
(Nationa l Organization to 
Reform Marijuana Laws). 

The present finds Cypress Hill 

The UCSD Guardian 

continuing to stay true to their 
roots and convictions, promoting 
their newest album, IV. Critics 
and long time fans might notice 
more of an eclectic feel to this 
album, as it seems to incorporate 
more musical styles than before. 
The group is careful about their 
perceived image, however. To 
those who might accuse them of 
crossing over or selling out, B-
Real had this to say: "What people 
don't understand is, if we take the 
music as high as we can, we're not 
leaving it behind to do another 
kind of music. We're taking it 
with us, taking advantage of the 
doors that were kicked the fuck 
open!" 

Still CUlling edge, still real 
hip-hop. and till commilled to 
expounding upon the virtue of 
gelling high, their appearance at 
1999 Sun God promises to be 
spectacular. With these seasoned 
live performers, who are known 
to rock any audience well , con-
certgoers arc in for a truly spe-
cial event. However, if you're 
only thcre for the music, you 
might want to remember those 
handy tips you learned in 
D.A. R.E. , and get used to the 
smell.

Reel Big Fish a ball

go anywhere, and the girls that fuck 
you over on the way," Barrell said. 

As a band that leamed fir t-
hand not to throw a cup of piss out 
of their van window while other 
windows are open, Reel Big Fish 
gathered all the e)(perience needed 
to make something from their col-
lective ball of energy. And while 
the name origin may change 
repeatedly over time, Reel Big Fish 
can be counted upon to deliver one 
caffeine-coated charge of ska-punk 
after another ... whether the Hunt-
ington Beach police Ii'ke it or not. 

Following Sun God's tradition 
of an eclectic line-up, Black Eyed 
Pea will be opening for Reel Big 
Fish. 

Black Eyed Peas are keeping it 
real. Real how they see it: With 
hip-hop music influenced by soul. 
jazz, and Latin rhythms. With a live 
band. With pumping, live shows 
that inspire Black Eyed Peas to 
bu t into acrobatic movements and 
that drive audiences to a frenzy. 

In a time when most hip-hop is 

, t--.• HfATIJS 17 

constructed around a familiar sam-
ple as the chorus and lyrics preach 
nothing but materialistic nonsense, 
the Black Eyed Peas stand out as 
something different. 

"Just 'cause we dress the way 
we do and perform with a band 
doesn' t mean we' re not hip-hop." 
said Will.I.Am, Black Eye Peas 
co-founder and lead rapper. "That 's 
who we are and we're not about 
fronting. This isn't about an image. 
this is about music, whether it fit s 
in the current scene or nol." 

And it's all laid out in Behind 
the Front, Black "Eyed Peas' Inter-
scope Records debut produced by 
Will.l.Am; the 16 song collection 
turns positive words and phrases 
into refreshingly novel ty les-
styles that set them apart from their 
peers and make them accessible to 
rans of music of all genres. " We 
made songs that could be under-
stood by the normal Ii tener where 
you don 't have to be a part of the 
scene to understand what we' re 
talking about," Taboo said. 

" I think that that it's not only 
because of the live sound, but 
because our music crosses musical 
boundaries as well as cultural 
boundaries," Apt said.

What do you think of this year's Sun God's 
bands? 
Interviews and 
Photography by Julius Cho. 

" I'm really excited about 
Cypress Hill and Black 
Eyed Peas but the other 
two bands I don't really 
know." 

"I like Cypress Hill. 
They're pretty old school 
and I like Black Eyed 
Peas. I'll probably drink 
then go to the concert." 

Andr •• Carrlll 

"I think it's great. It's going 
to be rockin ' ... all right, 
yeah." 

Erin Smith 
Roosevelt Freshman 

"J think it's going to be a 
lot of fun and I can't wait." 

Redha Akkinepalli 
Roosevelt Freshman 

" I like the lineup for Sun 
God. It has more variety 
than before. I saw [Cypress 
Hill] perform before and 
they're real hyped up."

In fact, the diversity behind 
the music of BEP are the three 
MC's: mani mic man Wi".I.Am, 
acrobatic Aplide.Ap and hypno-
tizing Taboo as we" as a four-
piece band. 

Important among the infec-
tious mu Iti-cultural beats and 
rhythms are the positive lyrics 
performed by Wi", Api and 
Taboo including those in 
"Fa"in' Up" and "Positivity." 
These songs express the frustra-
tion the group encountered 
when the hip-hop folks gave 
them grief for trying to explore 
new grounds and about looking 
to the positive side as relating to 
the state of hip-hop and its 
senseless deaths.

Canton, Ohio. 

Rose be recognized as at least a 
baseball player - if not a hard-
working person who spends more 
time with his children now than he 
did in his previous marriage, who 
was a radio talk show host for live 
years, and who currently runs two 
successful restaurants. 

Furthennore, he goes beyond 

the cost is $30 per team. 
The final sport in the intramural 

sports festival is coed floor hockey, 
perhaps one of the best intramural 
sports in existence. As with all the 
other spons, teams will panicipate 
in pool play for a chance at single 
elimination playoffs and shorter 
periods will mean more games to 
be played. 

Two divisions, open and coed, 
will battle in the crease to sec 
who's best. It only costs $30 per 
team to ,<om pete in the recreation-
al gym on Saturday and Sunday, 

bered for his 1U'eless work ethic. He 
never stopped 'working on his game 
on the praclice field and he never 
gave up on a play in a game. His 
motivation was simple: He loved to 
play soccer. Perflaps no Triton has 
ever loved to play the game more 
than McBride. It is a vinual guarantee 
that if it is even marginally sunny out, 
he will be playing somewhere. His 
love for the game was infectious, as 
his teammates always benefited from 
his great attitude and hustling play. 

baseball as a game that is played by 
the top .5 percent of the those who 
play it in this country who are major 
leaguers by conveying his love 
alTair with the sport through moti-
vational speeches to youth teams 
and to the Sacramento SpeeriJeads. 

Why should he not belong with 
the elite .5 percent as a manager or 
with the elite of the elite in the Hall 
of Fame? Why should he not 
deserve or be granted a second 
chance? As Acee points out, Rose 
believes that he could have a job 
managing a major league club the 
day he's allowed back in baseball.

and the rumor is that event sponsor 
Pizza Pon of Solana Beach may 
have some of its alcoholic wares 
available. Although unconfirmed, 
a beer garden alone would cenain-
Iy be worth the visit to Muir. To 
play, contact Joe Florin at 534-
37 16. 

Altogether, the Sun God intra-
mural spons festival just keeps the 
theme of UCSO's best weekend 
rolling. The players and fans 
wouldn't have it any other way. It 
confirms the fact that the 1M 
depanment is the best on campus. 

Jacob Bo"inger was a four-year 
defender for the Tritons. Always 
known as a hurd-nosed player, he 
never saw a tackle he didn 't like. 

He was an imponant pan of 
Arm trong's rotation of defender's. 
He was always there for his team, 
and his consistency and leadership 
in the locker room was needed the 
last two seasons. as the Tritons got 
a lot younger. 

These three players will defi -
nitely be missed. 

That son of salivating anticipation 
perfectly characterizes Rose's hus-
tle and determination to leave 
everything on the field after nine 
innings in every game he played. 

On the other hand, some say 
that he doesn't deserve to be let 
back into the game because he has-
n't admitted the truth of having bet 
on baseball games - if one had 
believed Giamatti's accusations. I 
would say that regardless, he is still 
one of the great ones and it would 
hurt no one to let the ballplayer 
who used to sprint to first base on a 
walk have his peace.

his personal desire to return to the 
game through con tant appearances

benefits of $25,OOO-a-day baseball 
galas (such a the one in 
Sacramento) in the form of an aver-

By John Maynard 
Sports Editor 

The squeak of rubber on hard-
wood has long since subsided in 
RLMAC Arena. The Triton bas-
ketball season is over, and with 
the conclusion of another solid 
season comes the culmination of 
Ihree women's collegiale baskel-
ball careers. 

On Feb. 20, seniors Janessa 
Bayda, Amy McClure and 
Tristen Teasdale sunk their final 
poinls and brought down their 
tinal boards as Tritons, Played 
agains t ' Christian Heri tage and 
backed by a supportive home 
crowd. thi s tinal game marked 
the end of three remarkable 
careers. 

For four yea rs, the three 
seniors have made their marks on 
Tri ton hoops, effectively carrying 
on UCSO's legacy as a women's 
basketball powerhouse. They 
were a part of an ever-growing 
tradition at UCSD: winning. 

Head Coach Judy Malone has 
been the brains behind the 
women 's basketball program 
since 197 In the 23 years 
she has been around, 
Malone has 
created pro- SEN'O 
grams destined 
for success. The pinnacle of 
such success was the 1997-98 
campaign, and thi trio of seniors 
were there for it all. 

The 1997-98 eason started 
off good, got better and ended 
up being the greatest UCSD bas-
ketball season ever. These 
seniors were key to the record-
breaking number of wins (23), 
consecutive wins ( 16) and points 
scored in a season (2020) - not 
to mention the largest average 
margin of victory (over 20 
points). 

As a result of the relatively 
young squad, the 1998-99 cam-
paign got off to a slower-than-
u ual tart . Soon, however, the

leadership skills of Bayda, 
McClure and Teasdale combined 
with Malone's coaching prowess 

turned a struggling team into an 
unstoppable power. 

By season's 
end the Irio led 
the Tritons to a 

solid 19-6 record. 
including an II -game winning 
streak. In addition, the Tritons 
out cored their opponents 1734-
1466, 

The most effective way these 
seniors led their team was 
through their efforts on the floor. 
Not one of them missed a single 
game. In fact, not one of them 
missed a single start. In each of 
the 25 games they played, the trio 
always led statistically, 

Bayda averaged 7.5 points per 
game, and shot a remarkable 36,2 
percent from behind the arc. She 
also shot an outstanding 73.3 per-
cent from the line. 

Teasdale was the Tritons'

quarterback. As point-guard, she 
ran an efficient offense that 
showed on the scoreboard. All in 
all , Teasdale racked up 229 points 
on the season - third-best on the 
team, She also averaged a sec-
ond-best 9.2 points per game. 
Teasdale also sti rred things up on 
defense and recorded 39 steals 
last season. 

McClure became the Tritons' 
go-to shooter from outside the 
three-point line. She led the team 
in three-pointers (40) and scored 
218 points total. She was also a 
monster on defense, racking up 
71 boards and a team-best 50 
steals. 

Bayda, Teasdale and McClure 
will leave the Triton basketball 
program next' month and 
Malone's team will greatly miss 
their skill , determination and 
leadership. But through their 
outstanding leadership both on 
and off the court, they leave a 
legacy easy for others to follow.

Whether he is denying ever hav-
ing place" a bel or is demonstrating 
his genuine passion for baseball in 
order to get himself reinstated, 
Rose did not deserve to be left out 
of MLB affiliation for the past 
decade. 

"Ten years went by prelly fast," 
Rose said according to the Union -
Tribune. "l'd say the punishment 
sure didn't tit the crime." 

For 1 0 long years, this man has 
suffered. The records that he holds 
cannot be denied from acknowl-
edgment in the Hall of Fame. 
Baseball is incomplete without 
Rose's honor allached to the presti-
gious recognition of Cooperstown.

Jabaar. who scored the most points 
of all-time. was excluded from the

Sayonara Soccer Seniors 
ALOHA: Three players are leaVing from Annstrong's squad 

By Travis Hili 
Associate Sports Editor 

Another year passes, and so it is time to 
say goodbye to another generation of 
UCSO men 's soccer stars. This year's crop 
of seniors, John Brandon, Doug McBride 
and Jacob Bollinger, were vital to UCSO's 
success over the last few seasons. 

Brandon was a fifth-year senior this 
season, and was unquestionably the team's 
leader. He was lucky enough to arrive at 
UCSO in 1994. one year after the 1993 
unit won the national champion hip. 
Brandon learned a great many lessons 
from being around those legends. and he 
used them to become one in his own right. 
He was not an outspoken, rah-rah type of 
player. Brandon did not have to scream to 
get his point across; he simply led by 
example. He was by no means a si lent 
player - he just knew how to get the job 
done . 

Not surprisingly, Brando{1 was an 
extremely talented player. However, he 
will be remembered for being the uhimate 
team player. Head Coach Derek 
Armstrong played him on the wing of his 
3-5-2 midfield when he arrived at UCSD. 
But by the time he was finished, Brandon 
was moved to sweeper, then back into the 
midfield, this time as a marking back. He 
was even moved up to striker in a few

Pete Rose: In Need 
of a Second Chance 

"Still Hustling" was the title 
of ISan Diego Union · Tribune] 
sports writer Kevin Aeee's arti-
cle on Pete Rose la t weekend. I 
want to give my response on 
why this trooper of the diamond 
should be reinstated into base-
ball and given hi s ticket to 
Cooperstown as a Hall of 
Farner. 

First of all , based on Acee's 
article, Rose has proven that he 
epitomizes baseball. When pre-
senting himself to an indepen-
dent minor league team in 
Sacramento (of all places) last 
Monday, the man howed 
everyone that he can sti ll move 
a crowd by playi ng the ro le of 
Mr. Baseball. 

On the field at 8 a.m .. Rose's 
morning adrenaline prompted 
him to get out of bed early, 
demonstrating his desire to 
interact with people .through this 
national pastime. (Rose's visit 
sure wa n't based on his exci te-
ment about visi ting Sacramento 
City College.) 

T,/len, for nine hours straight , 
the man hit grounders to the 
infield and outfield for 30 min-
utes, offered advice to batters 
during batting practi_ce and 
signed just about everything 
that a fan could throw in a 
sports figure 's face. including 
framed photos. To top it all off, 
by the end of the day, it was 
Ro e who was making speeches 
thanking the Sacramento 
Speerheads for allowing hi s 
presence on the field at 
~acramento City College. 

Oh, did we also forget that 
Rose compiled 4,256 career hits 
- the most all-time in baseball 
history? Yes, Rose eclipsed Ty 
Cobb's mark of 4,191 hits -
which had been held for six 
decades. T.hrough 24 seasons, 
his incomparable hustle and on-
field attitude made the world 
believe that he savored every 
moment of his career wi th the 
Ci ncinnati Reds. 

After becoming manager of 
the Reds. Rose was still held in 
high e teem. Unfortunately, in 
1989, the late commissioner 
Bart Giamatti accused Rose of 
gambling on baseball games, 
and as a result Rose was banned 
from baseball. He can never 
enter a major league clubhouse 
or be associated wi th any facet 
of Major League Baseball 
(MLB) beyond purchasi ng a 
ticket, a hot dog and si tting in 
the stand . 

Rose vehemently denied 
charge brought forth by 
Giamatti , who died hortly after 
the allegations went public, and 
for 10 years he has never admit-
ted to them. 

Are we to belie~e that Rose

- Tho Sun God 

By Jake Gordon 
Sports Editor 

As we wander aimlessly through 
our lillie UCSD lives, apillhy seeps 
into the very bowels of our souls. 
Yet, there is one weekend a year 
when our lazy eyes open wide 
and our sprits rise higher than the 
seventh noor of the library. There 
is one weekend during which we 
drop our books, throw our cares to the 
wind and head to the ocial center of campus to 
celebrate with our peers. Spring is here and thi' 
weekend of fun is so revered that it must only be 
whispered: Sun God. 

That magical icon of irreverence on Muir 
Quad stands for everything UCSD is not. In 
COSF 1631P0p Culture with' Professor Susan 
Davis, students are taught that carnival is a time of 
inversion and Sun God Weekend is UCSD' car-
ni val. Suddenly, campus becomes what college 
life should be: drinking, eating, innatable play-
grounds. great concerts and. of course, athletics 

Perhaps the best thing about Sun God 
isn't spending Friday afternoon in the 
sun with your homies, but the sports 
ex travaganza that begins Saturday 
morning. The UCSD [ntramural 
(1M) department (thi s writer 'S 
favorite department on campu ) is 
hosting the UCSD Sun God intra-
mural sports festival on May 15th 
and 16th. 

Probably the most underrated part 
of Sun God, the festival consists of four 
different competitions: outdoor basketball , coed 
noor hockey, even-on-seven coed soccer and 
coed lUbe water-polo. The events run the gamut 
of intramurals avai lable to UCSD students and 
simply make the weekend fun . 

"The [Sun God intramural sports) festival 's 
atmosphere is very unique to UCSD," Associate 
[ntramural Sports Director Matt Adams said. 
"It's a great way to have fun in the sun and enjoy 
sports." 

Probably the most popular of the four events 
is the annual Sun God outdoor basketball com-
passion. Located at Muir Court, the event fea-
tures UCSD' best and brightest (and only 
slightly hung over) going five-on-five for total 
basketball supremacy. Always looking out for 
the vertically-challenged, the 1M department 
wil l lower the rims to let everyone throw down, 
9 feet for guys and 8 feet for gi rls. This small 
change makes everyone believe they're Vince 

The UCSD Sun God Intramural Sports Festival 
continues Friday's fun all the way through the 
weekend with a plethora of exciting athletic events. 

Carter and exci ting NBA-style basketball is 
an inevitable result . 

On the court , teams are di vided into pools 
and attempt to qualify for single elimination 
playoffs. Yet perhaps even more popular than 
the team competition is the annual slam dunk 
contest wherein every Spud Webb wanna-be 
struts it for a chance at a new set of Puma 
sneakers, one of the event's sponsors. The con-
test will be at 12:30 p.m., sandwiched between· 
the men's intermediate division, beginning at 8 
a.m., and the men's open, beginning at 1:30 
p.m. The women's open division begins at 3:30 
p.m. The cost is $30 per team; interested parties 
should contact Ahmad Russ or D.H. Kim at 
534-3716 . . 

Almost as popular as the Muir Court dunk-
.fest is the seven-on-seven coed soccer tourna-
ment. [n a move similar to the lowering of the 

rims, the field is shrunken and offsides is elimi-
nated in an effort to make the games as exciting 
as possible. Teams'of three women and four men 
take the field in pool play, vying for a chance at 
the playoffs and the always-elusive Sun God 
coed soccer champion t-shirts, a source of pride 
for all who wear them. The competition begins 
at 8:30 a.m. on Muir Field and interested parties 
should contact Janine Harispe at 534-3716. The 
cost is $30 per team. 

The newest sport of the group is coed tube-
polo, a raucous game of deljght for the whole 
family. The object is to score in the pool ... that 
is, to put the ball in the net while paddling 
around in the water on inflatable inner tubes. In 
pool play (no pun intended), teams splash 
around to advance to the elimination playoffs. 

Unlike the usual intramural inner tube

Olsen Finally Bows Out At Nationals 
CLOSE: After two wins, Triton Kirsten Olsen loses in the quarterfinals to rival Amherst's No.1 player

Nothing lasts forever. Despite 
all their best efforts, the UCSD 
women's tenni team finally bowed 
out of the NCAA Di vis ion III 
National Championships at College 
of New Jersey. 

Perhaps if the team from 
Amherst College (Mass.) just 
stayed home UCSD would have a 
better chance. The so-called "Beast 
of the East" has knocked the 
Tritons out of the tournament two 

years in a row now and they still 
weren't sati sfied. On Sunday after-
noon, Triton Kirsten Olsen lost in 
the quarterfinal round of the 
singles championships to 
none other than 
Amherst's Jaime 
Cohen, the top-
ranked player in 
the tournament. 

In the National's team 
competlllon last Wednesday, 
Amherst knocked UCSD out in the 
second round with a 6-3 team vic-

tory. Since they were both ranked 
as No. I on their respective squads, 
Cohen and Olsen met up in the first 

singles match. Cohen's 6-2, 
6-1 win over Olsen 

helped lead the 
Jeffs on to the 
National 
Championship 

capping off an undefeated 
season. Apparently bad things 

happen in twos. It was the second 
time in two years that UCSD had 
lost to Amherst at Nationals, it was 

the second time in a week Olsen 
and Cohen had met on the court 
and it was the second time Cohen 
was victorious. 

After winning her first two 
matches of the singles portion of 
Nationals in straight sets, un seeded 
Olsen was perhaps a bit over-
matched losing to top-ranked 
Cohen, 6-1, 6-2. 

Despite the loss, Olsen, only a 
sophomore, can be proud of her 
accomplishments at Nationals. She 
will no doubt improve next year.
