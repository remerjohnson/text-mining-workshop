the problem, but he went out of his 
way to make sure I would never be

late-night review sessions for 
physic quizzes, experiments we 
performed in the re halls, or even

Scripps scientists study 
depletion of marine life 
A recent study by scientists from Scnpps 

Institution of Oceanography found that the 
warming ocean temperatures could be the 
reason fo r the depletion of manne life on the 
West Coast for the past 25 years. The trend 
shows that the numbers of fish, seabirds, 
kelp beds and zooplankton have also plum-
meted. John McGowan and other scientists 
from Scripps used data from the Califomia 
Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations 
to examine the changes In the California cur-
rent. The current onginates from the north-
em Pacific Ocean and passes along the 

orth American west coast. According to 
McGowan, data shows that the most likely 
cause of the change is a shift In the upper-
ocean heat content 

McGowan and hiS colleagues also recent-
~ published a report of the study results In 
Deep Sea Research Part II." The paper was 

co-written by Steven Bograd and Ronald 
Lynn of the National Manne Fisheries Service 
and Arthur Miller from Scripps. The scientists 
caution that similar forces affecting marine 
life could appear elsewhere if ocean temper-
atures continue to nse. 

McGowan and his colleagues also 
100 ed for different possibilities for the 
decline in manne life, but according to his 
conclUSions from the tests, other possible 
causes are not likely. The paper highlights a 
"regime-shift" to wamner ocean tempera-
tures, which lead to a disturbance in the 
process in which lower, nutrient-rich water 
mixes with the upper ocean. In tum, the 
thickening of a warmer water layer causes 
the nutrient-rich waters to deepen, disturb-
ing he food supply of plankton and other 
sea Ii e.

THURSI1AY. NOVEMBER 13, 2003 THE U D GUARI1IAN 

Textbooks: CalPIRG campaign to analyze costs, bundling 
continued from page I 

"California is one of the top-
three textbook markets in the 
nation and official must use their 
influence to benefit our students," 
Corpus said. "Costs can go as high 
as $1,415 at schools such as UC 
Irvine." 

According to U spokesman 
[Ianan Eisenman, UC bookstores 
are adopting certain policies to 
help students purcha e textbooks 
at lower prices. These policies 
include UC bookstores providing 
discounts, buying back books from 
studel1ls and making readi ng lists 
public property so they are accessi-
ble through private bookstores and 
online. 

Additionally, textbook costs are 
calculated into financial aid, 
accordi ng to Eisenman. 

"The UC is concerned with the 
prices of textbooks for our sru-
dents," Eisenman said. "We are 
beginning to work with student 
groups and the Academic Senate 
to see what we can do regarding 
the issue. We also expect to have 
conversation with reenlining 
about this issue." 

According to John Turk, the 
manager ofUCSD Bookstore, sev-
eral strategies are being used to 
lower thc costs of texthooks. One 
trategy is to work with academic 

departments to acquire reading 
lists and book lists earlier in order 
to attai n larger numbers of titles 
and in turn have a larger buyback 
list. Others include providing sru-
dents with more used books by 
ordering them wholesale and 
negotiating with publishers to get 
better prices and pas ing on those 
discounts to students. 

According to Turk, by negotiat-
ing with the publishers, prices of 
textbooks have been reduced by a 
total of $2 80,000 for the fall quarter. 

" If we look at those three 

strategie for fall quarter, it would 
lower the cost of education by 
over $800,000," Turk said. "Our 
goa l this year is to save students 
$2 million on the price of their 
books." 

Additionally, CalPIRG chap-
ters from different UC schools are 
conducting their own research and 
launching the Cheaper Textbooks 
Campaign. One of the campaign's 
goals is to convince faculty mem-
bers to produce multiple syllabi for 
a course, which would ensure that 
older versions of textbooks stay on 
the market for a 
longer period of 
time. 

" 

bundling additional materials with 
the books, or give bookstores the 
option of selling textbooks by 
themselves. 

"[The campaign) is important 
becau e we can't fight the ruition 
hike, and here's an aspect of cost 
that we ca n fight," sa id Jared 
Brown, who is coordinating the 
campaign for UCSD's chapter of 
CaIPIRG. "Textbook costs are 
something that can be changed." 

The campaign also outlines that 
bookstores should guarantee to buy 
back all textbooks for 50 percent of 

According to 
Turk, publi shers 
tend to come out 
with new versions 
of books every 
three yea rs. He 
said that this is

demand for used 
books, and pub-
lishers need to get 
some of those

however, if a book

originally bought 
as new or used -

for the next tenn,

order to sell the newer books. 

"There are areas where new edi-
tions are almost mandatory [and] 
there are areas where new editions 
tend to serve morc the purpose of 
eliminating used books from the 
market. But when you have bioengi-
neering, you don't want to use a 10-
year-old bioengineering book," 
UC 0 Bookstore Course Materials 
Manager David Wilson said. 

The CalPIRG camvaign also 
promotes com peti tion in the col-
lege book markets in order to drive 
down the list price of used text-
books. Additionally, the campaign 
is urging publishers to u e discre-
tion in publishing new versions of 
textbooks, stop the practice of 

the bookstore will 
buy back the book 

for half of the new price, according 
to Turk. 

"That's the best siruation and 
it goes down from that," Turk 
said. 

CaIP[RG met with UCSD 
Bookstore on Nov. 12 to dicuss the 
top-five textbooks sold on campus. 
The prices of these textbooks 
range from $37.35 to $134.70. 
Faculty members using the text-
books will be contacted and asked 
how new versions of these text-
books compare to older ones. One 
of the campaign's goals is to collect 
data in order to further analyze die 
problem. The report is expected to 
be available by mid-January.

method for students to save is the 
usc of book-swapping services. 
Accordi ng to A.S . Commissioner 
of Enterprise Operations Jeremy 
Cogan, he will be working with a 
new company called booksoncam-
pus. com to start an online book 
swa pping service for UCSD sru-
dents. Through the Web site, stu-
dents can list any book that they 
want to sell, at no chatge. The list 
will then be made available to 
anyone at UCSD. Each transac-
tion that connects a buyer to a 
seller would require a fee of $2.50 
from the two parties. According 
to Cogan, the entire process is 
simple and the fee is small com-
pared to the benefits that students 
would get from selling their 
books. 

"] feel like it's very important 
because there is no sol ution right 
now that srudents are feeling com-
fortable with," Cogan said. "The 
only solution out there is selling 
back books to the bookstore and 
many of them feel like they're not 
bei ng created fairly with that only 
solution." 

Communication with boo/isotl-
campus.com is still underway. 
According to Cogan, negotiations 
on a concract will take place within 
the next few weel:s, and he hopes 
to have the service operating by 
the start of winter quarter. 

According to Turk and other 
bookstore administrators, there 
are several ways for srudents to 
save further. These include mak-
ing sure that a book is needed 
before purchasing, using books 
from the library reserves and seil-
ing books right away if they are 
not being used for the next term. 
They also emphasized the impor-
tance of shopping around as well 
as buying books early in order to 
have a better chance of finding 
used books.

ness of appointing a task force to 
research the elections bylaws JUSt a 
few months before campaigns for 
next year's council begin. 

A clear consensus on the , tatus 
of the task forces was not reached . 

A third task force to research 
different methods of representa-
tion structure for the council was 
an item of new business at the 
Nov. 5 meeting, but was not 
included on the Nov. 12 agenda. 

"We realized that we've created 
two other task forces and we have 
not filled them YCt," Catcon said. 
"We'd rather fill those ta k forces 
or dissolve t.hcm before adding a 
new one," 

The task force on representa-
tion structure was originally sub-
mitted by Gallagher as a "govern-
ing documents review commit-
tee" at the Oct. 1 meeting. Since 
then, the task force has appeared 
four times in various forms on the 
A.S . Council agenda, but has 
never been debated on the coun-
ci l floor. 

The idea for a review of the 
current representation structure 
was sparked in part by the dispro-
portion of transfer student repre-
sentation on the council. 

The discussion regarding the 
task forces took place during the 
council caucus portion of the meet-
ing, which is designed as a forum to 
exchange ideas. Motions to dis-
solve or create task forces are not 
permissible during council caucus. 
Any action on the task force must 
be submitted as legislation to be 
considered by the council. 

"Let's just get it done," Cogan 
said.

The UCSD Guardian is published !'Nice a week at the UniverSIty of California at San Diego.

A.S. needs to explore 
election options 

T he Associated Students at UCSD are currently cO'lsid-
ering a proposal to reevalu-
ate the structure of the A.S. 
Council. Now, the council is 
comprised of a srudent sen-
ate made up of senators rep-
resenting each of the four 
clas es at their respective 
colleges. This ignores the 
reality that students do not 
primarily identify with their 
colleges, but rather with the 
campus organizations they 
join. The senate system 
needs to be changed, and 
hopefully the A.S. Council 
win recognize this. 

A more repre entative 
system of student govern-
ment is in place at UC 
Berkeley, whose senate is 
elected through proportion-
al representation. Senators 
are elected campuswide and 
voters rank the candidates in 
order of preference. The 
result is a enate that more 
accurately reflects the com-
position of the student body. 

A con tituent' intensity 

of preference is considered 
in the proportional repre-
sentation system, and most 
major campus groups have 
at least some representation 
on the senate. The council is 
more diverse and eclectic, 
and able to reflect more 
points of view. The College 
R epublica n s, Defend 
Affirmative Action and Goat 
Milk parties at UC Berkeley 
have all held a senate seat in 
the past two years. 

The mulotude of parties 
ensures that no single party 
has absolute control over 
the council. Unlike UCSD , 
where single-slate sweeps 
are common, only rare ly 
does B erkeley suffer from 
the overbearing presence of 
one-party rule and the sub-
sequent undue prevalence 
that these parties maintain. 

The AS C D should 
seriously consider switching 
to this format in the best 
interest of students, 
enabling them to have more 
accurate representation in 
student government. 

Inter ... college housing 
good idea, not enough 
T hanks to a new housing program, freshman students 
will be given the option of 
sharing on-campu apart-

ment~ with friends from 
different colleges next 
year. . 

This program is a good 
first step in addressing eri-
ous problem with on-carn-
pu housing at UCSD and 
~hould be expanded to meet 
the growing demand for 
inter-college housing. 

The housing crunch has 
forced fre hman into living 
in different colleges than 
the ones in which they are 
regi tered, p sing a diffi-
cult choice for some wish-
ing to Ii e with friends. 
The program will also 

~erve students residing in 
their own college~ who 
wish to live with friends 
made at other colleges for 
their ~econd year. Tl1is new 
option keeps student 
happy with tneir housing 
and helps to retain students 
on campu~ . 

However, there is room 
for improvement. The 
program is limited In 
scope. Under the new 
plan, tudents wishing to 
panicipa te will apply 
through early registration , 
competing for only 100 
s pots in 25 units at 
Warren Apartments. 

The number of pots 
should be expanded, as 
demand will, without a 
doubt, be much higher than 
upply. Inter-college hous-

ing should al 0 be made 
available throughout each 
of the six college campuses 
- instead of ju t Earl 
Warren ollege - to give 
a greater choice to srudents 
applying for the J?rogram. 

At a univerSIty where 
students c mplain of a lack 
of chool plrit and dead 
weekends, a pr gram that 
would potenually erve to 
retain more ophomore n 
campus is welcome nd 
shou ld be rapidly expanded 
to meet the demand fr m 
~tudents.

Voting increasingly becoming 
an issue of national importance 

'Saving Jessica Lynch' 
a media marvel 

Electronic ballot poses serious political problems; 
election information at risk with voting method 

Eager viewers a sign of an 
over .. marketed military 

By LOCAN CiOH 
Sen ior Staff Writer 

When people talk about 
shenanigans in the 2000 presiden-
tial election, they usually refer to 
the infamous hanging chads and 
the subsequent Supreme Court 
decision . More recently, the 

alifornia recall election was tem-
porarily halted due to concerns 
over the reliability of the mechani-
cal punch card systcm. Media 
attention has mostly focused on the 
need to replace the outdated punch 
card with a more modern electron-
ic voting system, but little has been 
said about what ought to be a much 
more important issue - the allega-
tions that the electronic voting sys-
tems may actually be even les reli -
able. 

Thankfully, this is slowly 
beginning to change as more peo-
ple become aware of the problems 
Witll the new electronic systems. 
Some of the more prominent news 
sources that arc reporting now 
include CNN and 71u no Yo,.k 
Ti7ltrS. 

There seems to be no reason 
why electronic voting systems 
lVould be less reliable than 
mechanical punch card systems, 
but facts are beginnmg to surface 
that suggest the companie in 
charge of implementing them may 
have failed to install proper ecu-
my safegu:lrds in their rush to 
mcet government-mandated 
deadlines. 

Diebold Election Systems, 
which has already sold over 
33,000 voting machines in the 

nited State, reccntly tried to 
prohihit the relea e of certain 
Information on the Internet. A 
colkction of internal company 

mcmo~ were aCCidentally left on a 
public web server and were di -
co\'cred by someone resea rch-
Ing ele tronic voting systems . 
Ilorrified by the conten ts, the 
re carcher released the memos to 
thc [nternet. ince then, D iebold 
ha been sending cease-and-desist 
leners to the I nternet Service 
Provider of any site hosting the 
leaked memos, claiming copyright 
infringemcnt. The plot has lhick-
ened as The Electronic Frontier 
Foundation and tanford 

nivcrsity's yberlaw Clinic 
recently filed for a temporary 
re training order against 

Diebold's actions in federal court. 
Regardless of the accuracy of 

these claims, they do bring up an 
interesting point : The current 
generation of electronic voting 
machines leaves no paper trail. 
The only records are stored e1cc-
tronically in voting database. 
Diebold has repeatedly resi ted 
suggestions to print out receipts 
of the vote, and said it would be 
much too costly to instal! printers 
and rewrite software in the exist-
ing voting machines. 

" The question then 
becomes, exactly how 
much is democracy 

worth? ... What sum of 
money is large enough to 
justify the risk of turning 

elections into 
lotteries?" 

The question then become , 
exactly how much is democracy 
worth? \Vhat sum of money is 
large enough to justify machine 
error putting the wrong president 
in power? \Vhat sum of money is 
large enough to justify the risk of 
turning elections into lotteries? 

[n the 2000 presidential elec-
tion, one of the Florida precincts 
uploaded a memory card from a 
Dlcbold voting machine contain-
ing negative 16,000 votes for can-
didate AJ Gore. It was the obvious 
impossibility of having a negative 
number that prompted the 
recount. In the next election, if 
things do not change and punch 
card machine are replaced with 
the current electronic voting 
machines, there will be no possi-
bility for a recount, as only elec-
tronic records will be kept. 

In the best-case scenario, we 
will have some small amount of 
vo ter error - how much voters 
will never know - but maybe the 
next pre ident will win the elec-
tion by Stich a large margin that 
machine error does not change

the result. In a worst-case sce-
nario, hackers could penetrate the 
machines' security and change the 
votes, with no way for US to verify 
the altered results. 

Lucki ly, there is hope in sight. A 
bill, HR 2239, is already being put 
in front of Congress that would 
require all voting machines to have 
a verifiable audit trail. While the 
bill is sponsored by a Democrat, 
this is certainly an issue that should 
have the support of anyone eager 
for accuracy. It is not about tax cuts 
or social security or the war in Iraq : 
It is aboul making ure that the 
president who gets into office i the 
one that got voted in. 

The 2000 presidential election 
proved that the voting system had 
grave flaws that needed to be cor-
rected. In California's recall elec-
tion, we saw that the problem 
weren't entirely solved. While elec-
tronic voting booths provide some 
hope in their ability to make voting 
easier, there are ecurity risks 
involved, and ease of use shouldn't 
be sacrificed for increased problems 
with maintaining privacy. It's clear 
that it will take a bipartisan effort 
and perhaps a litde more popular 
outrage before this issue is resolved.

By JESSICA LlNCiEL 
Opinion Editor 

Hollywood writers could not 
have imagined a more gripping and 
rousing story than that of the Iraqi 
capture of Army Pfc.jessica Lynch. 
The dramatic Special Operations 
rescue caught on videotape could 
have been yanked from the most 
ambitiou military creenwritcr, in 
the fashion of succe ses such as 
"Black Hawk Down" and "Saving 
Private Ryan." 

Lynch's rescue will go down as 
one of the most stunning pieces of 
news management yet conceived. 
Of course, the docudrama was only 
a maner of time, and it's not hard to 
see why. NBC's airing of "Saving 
jessica Lynch" drew 14.9 million 
viewers, according to preliminary 
figures is ued by ielsen Media 
Research. 

Lynch became an icon of the war. 
An all-American heroine, the story 
of her capture by the Iraqi mi Ii tary 
and her rescue by U.S. special forces 
became one of the great patriotic 
moments of the War on Terrorism. 
And if timing is everything, then it 
certainly couldn't have happened at 

a more crucial moment, when talk 
was of bogged-down coalition forces 
and people were skeptical of a victo-
ry too slow in coming. 

In a way, it was what everyone 
needed to sec. You have a beautiful, 
all-American soldier doing her part 
in a battle that must be noble if it's 
named "Operation Iraqi Freedom." 
She's fighting the forces of tyranny 
and standing up for her country, 
overcoming horrific ordeals in the 
name of liberty. I ow fade out her 
profile wih a \~~ving American nag 
and wait for the ratings to soar and 
the royalties to collect. 

Maybe there's nothing wrong 
with taking an ordeal and marketing 
it in the name of increasing pauio-
tism. Maybe there's nothing wrong 
in exploiting the story of a young 
woman who has already become the 
poster child for the American sol-
dier. But this story is becoming less 
about an mdividual made into a 
message and more about the overall 
image that the military wants to 
project on the pa t. 

In creating the media circus sur-
rounding the Iraqi war as a whole,

Lynch: 
Docudrama

continued from page 5 
the stra tcgy was to concentrate on 
the visuals 'Illd to ge t a broad mes-
sage out. Detai l - when helpful -
followed behind. The key was to 
ensure the right television footage. 
T he embedded reporters could do 
some of that. On other missions, 
the military used their own cam-
eras, editing the film thcmsclve 
and presenting it to broadcasters as 
ready-to-go packages. 

It's a dangerous trend, market-
ing the military. There 's a halance 

" Itls a dangerous trend , 
marketing the military. 
There's a fine balance 
between keeping the 
public informed and 

keeping them on 
your side. " 

in keeping the public II1formeo and 
keeping it on your side. The hea n -
wrenchjng story of Lynch was the 
be ·t of both worlds. It \Va, herOism 
that only thc hardc,t hean could 
label as jingoist prop:lganda . 

one of this is to say that Lynch 
isn't a heroine, th.1t her action~ 
weren't admirable or that she does-
n't deserve praise. But clearl), this is 
an issue that surpasscs the indvidual. 

With a nation so willing to be 
caught up 111 the dramatized version 
of a heroine's story, other thing> arc 
also dramatized. Ccrtainly, details 
lvill be disputed and facts ques-
tioned . BU[ who's que tioning 
whether thi story should havc ever 
Illade the evening time lot? 

s moving JS this story is, it's 
not helping anyone understand the 
struggle to rebtllid Iraq, or e\'en 
how that ~rrugglc came to be. It 's 
JUSt one in a lint! of distractiuns that 
keep peo ple from forllling accurate 
opinions about Intervention in 
Iraq . Imtead offocu ing on a single 
story, attention should be shifted to 
actual involvement. 

10re than anythmg, the success 
of "Savlng jessicJ Lynch" shows

Bryan Tran: UCSD community 
remembers Revelle junior 

Ropes: Course aims to develop 
students' team .. building skills 

continued from page z 
to journalism to graphic design," T hurgood 
Marshall College junior and fellow bioengi-
neering major Alexander Varond said . "His 
Web page shared his life projects with the 
world , and we always talked about the crazy 
projects that he would undertake . For 
instance, he made an entire map o f the 
UCSD campus and hyperlinked every part 
of thc campus to a picnlre that he had taken 
of that pl ace. H e measured the distances 
within 0.006-milc accuracy between each 
landmark using his bicycle speedometer. " 

M any of his friends said they looked up 
to Tran. 

" I saw so much potentia l in him and I 
looked up to him as a role model," Varond 
said. " He taught me to explore life, be dedi -
cated, fi nd the things that I love and try my 
hardest at them." 

Marshall jun ior Bernard Chung, a high 
ch 01 classmate, also spoke of his admira-

tion for Tran. 
" I saw Brya n as a reserved ge n ius, 

because he pret ty much knew how to solve 
anything and was always o n top of his 
work," Chung said. "He did not take life as 
a joke, but took it to the fu ll e t. It was a joy 
talking to him about movies, sports and 
anythi ng else that we cou ld think of. I 
loved reading his Web page. It was a work 
of art with beautiful photography, intricate 
graphic de igns and articles of writing that 
would qualify to bc outstanding journal-

Counselors from Psychological Services

"Our main focus is to benefit the UCSD 
community," Gallagher said. 

Consisting of tall towers and va rious 
lines connected to harnesses, the course will 
be designed for use by groups of 20 to 30 
people. Planners envision its function to be 
primarily in srudent organization retreats, 
summer conferences and company team -
bui lding venru res. 

"The course will be bui lt with the stu-
dents' interests in mind ," O utdoo r 
R ecreation di rector Brian G rube said. 

Grube hopes the course wi ll bring togeth-
er students living both on and off campus. 

Construction is anticipated fo r January 
2004, and the new faci lity is projected to 
open within a week to 10 days from the start 
of construction. With no need for large-
scale landscaping or gradi ng, the develop-
ment is estimated to take "a few days to 
build - a week max," A.S. Commissioner of 
Enterprise Operations jeremy Cogan said. 

\Vi th the bulk of planning already com-
pleted, the next step, according to Cogan, is 
to converse with architects to define when 
and how construction wi ll tak.e place. 

Associated Students and UCSD 
Recreation are collaborating to subsidize the 
ropes course, with both parties investing 
$60,000. ixty-five percent of all profits are 
expected to go to Campus Recreation, while 
the remaining 35 percent will be allocated to 
Associated tudents. Campus Recreation 

will assume responsibility of logistical mat-
ter , including employment, financia l affai rs 
and maintenance, while Associated Srudents 
is expected to generate business by market-
ing to srudents. 

The idea of a ropes course Started to rurn 
into a reauty at the beginrung of this yea r after 
several years of d.iscussion by A.S. councilmem-
bers. Tn February, the AS. Council submitted a 
proposal to the Campus Community Planrung 
Committee to bui ld the course in the eucalyp-
tus grove located on West Campus. The 
CCPC formally smick the proposal down 
because of the course's locale and varying view-
points on the scale of the project. 

After the CCPC's rejection of the initial 
locale, an alternative location was suggested 
in October. This time the location sought 
was across Interstate-5 on the grounds of 
East Campus, with prospective building to 
be located south of the softball field and 
north of Thornton Hospital. 

" It was highly recommended to find land 
designated as [already existing] sports and 
recreation land," said Don Chadwick, direc-
tor of Sports Facilities/Student Affairs. 

The second plan was pas ed unanimous-
ly by the cepe. 

Planners estimate that the costs for uSll1g 
this new facility will be lowest for UeSD sru-
dents, \vith a roughly projected co t of about 
$15 for a full day's actiVities. :-.ion-UeSD 
members \vill pay the most (around 50), 
while faculty and staff members can expect to 
pay a fee that falls somewhere in between.

When 1I10vies by Indian film-makers are mentioned, images of Bollywood, people 
flirting in song behind trees and 

romances like "Monsoon 
Wedding" come to mind. But 
first-time director Vikram 
Yashpal's new film "Trade 
Offs" delivers suspense , 
drama, romance and every-
thing necessary in a good 

film . Yashpal's c riti cally-

Gllan/ian: I low does "Trade Offs" com£:lre 
to other Indian- merican films like "Mo~~ 
Wedding" or " Bend it Like Beckham"? 

Anup ugunan: Well, just budget-wise, 
they had a lot more money than we had. heir • 

mo\~es were made with millions of dollars and 
ours is very low budget. It's all made with fir t-
time actor and crew. Even the director had 
never set foot on a movie set before. It was his 
first time. But in terms of passion that comes from 
that first time you do something, you give it all 
you 've got without money or re turns. That's what 
allowed us to come this far. 

D eypika Singh: I would agree with Anup in terms of 

actors what he shot. 0 when we were shooting, we didn 't see anything. \.Ve didn 't see a si n-
gle hot until it wa all done. 

A.S.: Yeah, he kicked me out of the editing room. 
D.S.: The trailer was the first time we saw ourselves on the screen and we were like, uOh 

my god, how did you make us look like that?" !laughs] It was really 3m3t.ing. 
G: I low did you get involved in this project? 
A.S.: I was a programmer at the SDAFF in 2001 and they had a radio show - the direc-

tor and one of the other producers. I was on the radio show with a couple of other lilmmak-
ers and they knew I was interested in film, but I had never made a film. They knew] was into 
music so they asked me to compo e for them, but I said, "] want to act! Let me audition and 
if I get it, I get it." 

G: It eems, from the trailer, that culnlre is a really important parr of the film, as with o ther 
Indian-American films. 

D .S.: The culrure is not a big part of the movie. They're just Indians, but honestl y they 
could be anyone e lse. If you replaced the characters with people from Tennessee, the story 

would still make sense. The sari that you see is in a dream sequence and it's the 
only time that you see her [character Sapna] in a san. See, the story 

is about the transition of getting marrIed and getting to know 
each other's personalities. 

~ Was it a great experience to be involved in 
sonwthing like this' 

"A-S.: Totally' 
D lS .: Incredible [laughs]. It was so awe-

som e. Probably one of the cooles t of my 
life so far, and I'm not exaggera ting. 

\Vhat made it so cool was that it Wd 
th is unbelievable , extraordinary sirua-

fun it was. Imagine most of the cast, 
50-plus people and most of them Jre

Fifty people how it's not entirely made by professionals in the field who

he said to u , " Hey you guys, I want to make a movie," and we just laughed at him. 
We realized he was serious and started writing the script and it came so far. 

A.S.: Bur the end result is we hired a few key personnel who were experienced and that got 
us the look of a polished film . 

G: It must be amazi ng to see your movie take off like this.

Of course, things being what they are, this is an

Two weeks to closing, the Scene brings a 
great indie-pop show to San Diego 
By JESSICA UNGEL 

Senior Staff Writer 

Death Cab for Cutie albums ha ve been a staple in the coi-le cion of any emo or indie 
fan i nee the 1998 release of 
o1llctbl/lg About Airplants on 

Barsuk Records. With the addi-
tions of a few Ps, its phenome-

and it most recent record, 
Transatl«nticism, Death Cab for 
Cutie ha every rea on to expect 
an admiring and dedicated crowd 
on its current tour, which will be 
hitting an Diego on I v. 16 at 
th e Scene. 

Taki ng the stage wi th 1a te of 
State , fellow label -mates ada 

urf and The Long \Vinter, 
Death Cab has a lot to celebrate 
on the current tour, promoting 
the new albul11 that ha won prai e 
from ' ources as di parate a ' 
Playboy, pin and Billboard. 

The four-piece band con ' ists f 
Benjanlln GIbbard (vocals),

comes just twO weeks before the 
venue closes its doors on ov. 30. 
Death Cab's tour will' be wrapping 
lip in e ttle at about the same 
time. 

Attendants to the concert 
won 't be disappointed. On the 
band's fourth full-length, 
Gibbard' lyrics are WI stful 
metaphors that have won fans 
since his first album. C,ibbJrd's

10 HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 13, ZOO] 

Two international ethnic performers pay a visit to UCSD 
Cesaria Evora brings her evocative 

melodies from Cape Verde to UCSD }J 
By MARA EVANS 
Senior Staff Writer 

M a1l1 trcam musician communicate a message to listeners through their music. 
The messages are political, 
cmotional or trite, but they 
are messages of feeling. It is 
rare to have omeone deliver 
you to a piller with their music, 
to transport you to the location 
that has inspired their music. 

Ce ana EYora, the 
"barcfoot diva" from the 
Cape Verde Islands, does 
just thl with her lyrics. 

Evora, by today' 
standard, h~d a late 
start in the music indus-
try. She did nOt begin 
recording until the age 
of H, but today, the 61-
year-ol d ~1I1gcr has 
multiple albums to her 
namc and fivc GramllW 
nOlTIlnan On to brag 
about. 

Iler most recent album, 
/0':' d' rl111or, I her ninth and 
she continues to maintain 
the signature melodic sound 
that has made her a global 
en anon. 

Evora's home, the volcanic 
Capt: Verde Islands off the coast 
of \Vcst rica, serves as a setting 
for her music. Through it, she 
shares her culture and tradition 
with her listeners, with the tradi -
tional Capeverdean "Mornas" and 
"Coladei ras ." These poignant styles of 

music invoke Cape Verde's Brazillian and 
Portugese colonial roots, incorporating 
jazz, blues and samba as well as Cuban and 
African rhythms. 

The music serves as a foundation for 
Evora to build her vocals. She has been 
compared to Billy Holiday and Edith Pilaf, 
but in all regards Evora is herself. Her 
song "Velocidade" from /l0z d' A1110r is a 

quintessential example of how 
Evora evokes the Islands with her 
songs. 

On 'Velocidade," listeners 
will feel the sea breeze on their 
cheek, the erting sun on their 
legs and hear the palm fronds 
blowing above their head . 
Listeners' hip will sway to the 

sweet ound of the clarinet and 
you will be tran ported to the 
island of ao Vincente. 

Perhaps you will not under-
stand Evota's native lyric, bur 
the sensation is trong enough to 
help you embark on an auditory 
journey like no other.

auditory discovery, don't miss

By ANDRE Rlos BOLLINGER

HOW many Tupac documentanes Jre there) 100 many. Lu laly, thl IS the one to see. Through 
footage of Tupac a a dod,:)' lad to 
his eX'jJlanaoon of why he refused to

REVIEW

anced yet lo,;ng image of the rap-
per is re"ealed, although many 
details, such as his time in jai l, legal 
troubles and the infamous East 
Coast-\Vest Coast rivalry, are mere-
ly tOuched upon. 

Beginning ,vith his mother's 
in" h'ement in the Black Panther 
and pregnancy in jail, Tupac's life is 
put into context. He discusses hi 
inspirations, role models and orug-
gles to write about the duality oflife

Through interviews, home

ry readings, Tupac's political rage 
and idea on thug Ii fe are laid out

Tupac said. "1 diagnosed it." Tupac

The documentary's most 
remarkable acluevement i the way 
it captures Tupac as he discovers 
him elf and forges an identity for 
his community. 

The soundtrack is produced by 
Eminem and bring Tupac and 
Biggie Smalls back together for the 
single 'Runnin' (Dying to Live)." 
Many of the hits that make Tupac 
the best- e1ling rap artist of all time 
are also fearured. 

"Tupac: Re urrection" does not 

attempt to draw conclusions about

brates his life and hints at how it

Cutie: 
Brilliant lyrics 
& sound equal 

great how 
conrintlcd from page 9 

feel the album has lost some of the 
thrilling lyrical surprises that were 
a constant presence on the previ-
ous release, but that criticism does 
a disservice to Tr(f1)sa tlal1 ticis'lll 's 
balance of lyricism and musical 
sophislication . The new album 
isn 't as distanced from ome of the 
previous releases as some cr iti cs 
would have listeners believe. 

The first song, "This is the 
ew Year," hearkens back to the 

early days of Sormthillg About 
Airplanes with its tone of subtle 
optimism shrouded in lilting gui-
tars . and gentlc percussion. 
Inventive lyric such as "Your 
heart is a river that flows from 
your chest through every organ 
and your brain is the dam and [ 
am the fish who can't reach the 
core" on "Lightne s" demon-
strates the kind of brilliance that 
people have come to cxpect from 

ibbard . The Jddillon of piano 
throughout the album serves as a 
wonderful b~ e to the someti mes-
haunting, sometimes-cheerful 
lyrics, providing a flexible range 
to match the shifting vocal. 

It's hard not to attach the suc-
cess of Gibbard's side project, 
Postal Service, with Death Cab's 
recent release. Some of the techno 
mastery that gives Postal Service 
such a definitive ound on its first 
full-length album, Givt Up, seems 
to echo through certain tracks off 
Trnnsotlan,icis-m, like " ound of 
Settling" or the title track, 
"Transatlantici m." 

But similar ities to sa te llite 
bands aside, TrollSotlomicism is a 
great album in the best tradition 
of the indie-alternative genre, 
with fresh lyrics and musical con-
fidence that are a welcome alter-
native to mainstream pop bore-
dom. 

There's a wonderful optimism 
amongst all the melancholy, a 
message that sad ness and confu-
sion don 't have to be overwhelm-
ing. That ability is probably what 
prompted Spin magazine to name 
Gibbard the " poet laureate of the 
young and hopeful." More impor-
tantly, it's probably what draws 
fans from all over the cou ntry to 
Death Cab's music, both as a 
musical influence and as an 
encouragin g soundtrack to those 
in search of eloquent honesty 
tempered by a hint of hope .

Seagull: The madness of 
Chekhov is brought to stage 

continued from page 9 
logues seem like hollow, zealous 
performances. 

But a stunning exception comes 
from the most painful moment of 
the play, involving the love story of 
the schoolteacher Medvedenko 
(Brad Fisher). 

Full of life and energy as he 
attempts to win the heart of M.asha, 
Medvedenko completely trans-
forms into a spectacle of quiet mis-
ery after Masha marries him out of 
convenience. As Masha, Colette 
Beauvais offers a deliciously dis-
turbing and subtle performance as 
she shoots verbal barb after barb at 
her pathetic husband. 

The set, designed by Kevin 
Judge, is nothing short of brilliant. 
Pushing the walls as far ou t as they 
go, Judge 6lls the e'lormous space 
with semi-transparent paintings 
which are brought to life by the 
lighting design of Shirley Halahmy, 
silently expressing every nuance 
and mood of the play. 

Director Luissa Kokernot uses 
this modest space to arrange the 

many characters like figures in an 
oil painting, creating images of 
sheer beauty as characters fight 
each other into madness. Despite 
the fact that nearly the en tire cast is 
onstage for most of t h e show, 
Kokernot ensures that the audi-
ence's eyes are gently drawn to the 
dramatic action, but not 0 force-
fully that the audience is torn by 
what they would like to see. 

So if you're in the mood for a 
simple and digestible story, go wait 
in the lines at Blockbuste r. But if 
you dare to enter the world of 
Chekhov and experience madness, 
lust, despair, lularity, ir ony and 
beauty, catch a ticket to "The 
Seagull" before every show is sold 
out.

No. 1 Tritons win last three 
Women's volleyball bids farewell to seniors 

ByANU KUMAR 
Associate Sports Editor 

The top-ranked UCSD 
women's volleyball team closed 
out a perfect home record in 
2003 by earning sweep in its 
final three contests in a five-
match homestand . The Tritons 
earned 3-0 victorie over Grand 
Canyon on ov. 5, UC Davis on 
Nov. 7, and Chico State on Nov. 
8 to finish 11-0 at RIMAe Arena 
this season. 

Senior ight was celebrated 
on ov. 8, marking the final regu-
lar season home game for Ashley 
Petersen, Lauren Mills and 
Denelle Smalley. Wanting to give 
the seniors a victory in what might 
be their final match at RIMAC 
took some of the attention away 
from attaining a perfect I 1-0 
home record. 

"I didn't talk to them about it 
at all," UCSD head coach 
Duncan McFarland said. "It's a 
big accomplishment to play at 
UCSD for four years. It is a big 
deal, and we wanted to give them 
a good sendoff in the last home 
game ... and it went according to 
script." 

The Tritons had little trouble 

disposing of the Antelopes on 
ov. 5, giving up the lead only 

once in the victory. UCSD won by 
the scores oDO-18, 30-19 and 30-
20. Outside hitters junior Bonnie 
Wilson and sophomore Lindsay 
Crandell each had I I kills, while 
junior middle blocker Katie 
Hogan had an all-around game 
with even kill , four digs and four 
blocks. 

Against UC Davis, the Tritons 
came out strong and controlled 
the first game, winning 30-14. 
Game two was a different story, 
however, with the Aggies getting 
out to an 18-9 advantage. The 
Tritons inched their way back, 
scoring five straight points and 
evenrually tying the game at 20-
20. 

either team could put the 
other away until the score reached 
27-27, when UCSD scored the 
final three points on a service ace 
by junior middle blocker Kendra 
Canape and two service aces by 
junjor outside hitter Stacey 
Dunsmore. The Tritons were able 
to wrap up the match from there, 
taking game three by a score of 
30-22. 

On Senior Night, UCS D did-
n't yield the lead to the Wildcats

continued from page 20 
both the UCSD men 's and 
women's teams posed a serious 
challenge to UC Davis. 

The two women's teams 
have a history of extremely 
close meets. In 2002, UC 
Davis carne to UCSD expect-
ing to win, but the UCSD 
women surpri ed them, win-
ning by only nine points. 
Then, Davis evened the score 
by coming in first over UCSD 
a t the Pad fic Conference 
Championships. 

Senior co-captain Carolyn 
Kwok was happy about the 
Triton women's victory. 

"It was an intense dual 
meet," Kwok said. "We were 
really happy about our win." 

The team camaraderie and 
the loud cheering helped both 
UCSD teams swim faster, 
according to Kwolc. In one 
instance, Kwolc said the cheer-
ing aided a come-from-behind 
win by sophomore Sophie 
Levy in the 1000-yard 
freestyle. 

The UCSD men's team, on 
the other hand, has 10 t to UC 
Davis by large margins in 
recent year. The Nov. 8 meet 
was the fir t rime that they 
have come clo e to a win . In 
fact, the male swimmers from 
UC D earned more points 
than those from UC Davis, 
but the Aggie divers made the 
overall score shift in their 
favor. 

ln addition to Improving on 
last year's score against U 
DaVl , UCSD al 0 earned many 
NCAA qualifi ations. 

On the women's tcam, there 
were 10 consideration qualifica-
tions and five automatic qualifi-
cations. The automatic quali-
fiers were sophomore Ro anna 
Delurgio in the 100-yard 
breaststroke (I minute and 3.63 
seconds); senior Denise Bogard 
in the 100-yard breaststroke 
(I :06.00); freshman Emily 
Harlan in the 50-yard freestyle 
(24,08) and the IOO-yard 
freestyle (51.98); and freshman 
Susan Bell, Delurgio, sopho-
more Sarah Grant and Harlan 
in the 200-yard medley relay 
(1 :47 .88). 

There were seven considera-
tion qualifications on the men's 
side. The lone double-event 
qualifier was freshman Jacob 
Dong in the 100-yard breast-
stroke (59.20) and the 200-yard 
brea tstroke (2 :09.41). 

UCSD head coach Scott 
McGihon was pleased with the 
team's performance. 

"The team did a phenome-
rul job in preparing for the 
meet and stepping up to swim," 
McGihon said. "People wam 
faster than they've ever swum 
before." 

Inspired by their achieve-
ments against the Aggies, the 
UC D wimmers and diver 
hope to beat al tate 
Bakersfield on ov. 15. 
M ihon expects the women 
to win, while h expects the 
men' meet [Q be very competi-
tive. 

"It hould be interesting to 
ee h w our t:rengths play out 

against their trengtlu," 
Me ihon said. 

until the third game. 
In the first two games, the 

Tritons scored the first points and 
never looked back, winning each 
one by a score of 30-17. 

In the third frame, Chico State' 
held a brief 6-5 lead, but UCSD 
came back to win the next three 
points. The Tritons continued to 
pull away from that point, and the 
match ended on a kill by Smalley 
to give UCSD a 30-22 win. 

The Tritons remain one game 
behind rival Cal State San 
Bernardino for first place in the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association. They have an overall 
record of 23-4 and a CCM 
record of 17-3. With the regular 
season coming to a clo e after this 
upcoming weekend, the Tri tons 
would like to take over the confer-
ence lead to avoid facing the 
Coyotes at their own gym in the 
postseason. 

UCSD will wrap up the regu-
lar sea on by goi ng on the road 
to face Sonoma State on Nov. 14 
and San Francisco State on Nov. 
15. Cal State San Bernardino will 
also be on the road taking on Cal 
State Dominguez Hill and Cal 
State Los Angeles on Nov. 14 
and Nov. 15, respectively.

seconds later on a goal by opho-

UCSD junior forward Tiago 
Venruri scored the gamc-winning 
goal at the 63:47 mark when he 
took a pass from sophomore mid-
fielder Matthew Davey and beat 
Toro goalkeeper Javier Barragon in 
the far post. 

In the finals, Chico State took 
the lead just four-and-a-half min-
utes into the match and then 
recorded the game's following 
three goals to open a 4-0 advantage 
over the Tritons. UCSD's only goal 
came on Davey's eighth of the sea-
son when he headed a pas from 
Venruri into the back of the net. 
Davey had the chance to core 
again, but he failed on a penalty 
kick, his fir t miss in five tries thiS 
eason . 

"You lmow it wasn't our game 
when you miss 3 penalty kick," 
U SD head coach Derek 
Arm trong said. "It just wasn't 
meant to be." 

Chico State, n w 17-4- 1, is 
currently ranked No. 12 in the 
nation, and the Wildcats are 
showing sings that they can win 
the nationa l championship. 

"They were exceptional against 
us Ion Nov. 9)," Armst:rong said. 
"They have the look of a champi-
onship team. They are rea lly com-
mitted," 

UCSD will have to make some 
adjustments this weekend. The 
Tritons regular defensive line will 
be unavailable. Senior Ryan Blair, 
junior Luke Russell and ophomore 
Garrett King will mi the Nov. 14 
game due to injuries, and seni r 
Jonathon Shlll1l will be fo rced to si t 
out becall c of a red card ejecrion 
that he received in U SD's Nov. 9 
game. 

"We have to try to learn ome-
thing from our other gam against 
Chico," Armstrong said. "And we'll 
need me help from ollr frc hmcn, 
wh are going to have to rep up 
thi weekend."

Tritons beat Sonoma State, CSUDH to win fourth straight title

Triton trouncing: UCSD women's soccer claimed Its fourth straight conference 
title on Nov 9. They will see their eighth national title at home on Nov 15. 

By ALAN MCBROOM 
Staff Write r 

The UCSD women's soccer 
team wrapped up its fourth consec-
utive California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Championship on Nov. 
9 in Carson, Calif. The TritOns 
soundly defeated host Cal State 
Dominguez Hills 5 -\ in the CCAA 
finale with four skillful goals, 
including a two-goal effort by 
enior hannon Harrelson. 

Playing on a worn out field did-
n't seem to bother UCSD at all, 
and although the game was played 
on the Toro home field, the fan 
base was overwhelmingly pro- an 
Diego. 

UC D gOt off to a quick tart, 
scoring in the seventh minute. 
Senior All-American Kristin Jones 
stole the ball at the top of the 18-
yard box. he dribbled around one 
defender and physically overpow-
ered another before bla ting a hot 
into the upper right V. 

Emphasizing the importance of 
the first goal, Harrelson said, "It 
was the play of the game." She her-
self added the next nvo goals, both 
ju t a spectacular as Jones' solo 
di play. 

Her first goal followed a foul 
near the sideline about 25 yards 
out. Senior free kick and eorner 
kick specialist Christine Wensel 
addressed the ball and sent it curv-
ing toward the far post. Wensel put 
the ball right on the money, and 
Harrel on put it away with a head-
er pa t Cal State Dominguez Hills 
keeper Alba Garcia. Overlooking 
the entire play from the stands, 
spectators saw the et piece devel-
op, and a cheer went up even 
before the ball touched the back of 
the net.

where the Tritons were upended 
by Chico State 5-1 on ov. 9. 
However, the team's thrilling vic-
tory in the emifinal was enough 
to earn them a bid into the 24-
team CAA tournament, which 
begins on ov. 14. 

UCSD, which has won the 
DiVision III national champi-
on$hip three ume , will be making 
i first ever appearance in the 

CAA DIVision II tournament. 
Along with the Tritons, who 
earned the i o. 3 eed for thl

" ur thing is to believe in your 
nms and do your job," Harrelson 
said of the Triton set pieces. 

The combination of Wensel to 
Harrelson struck again in the 69th 
minute. Wensel pushed up from 
her left back position and ran OntO 
a slow roll ing pass. She lofted it 
over the Toro defense, putting the 
ball high enough in the air for 
Harrelson to run under it. 
Harrelson finished the scoring 
chance with another well-placed 
header for her second goal and 
earned Wen eI another assist. 

Cal State Dominb'uez Hills saw 
the game slipping away from them, 
and they responded with a quick 
goal after the restart. Less than 20 
seconds after Harrelson's tally, Cal 
State Dominguez Hills I ikki' Szlak 
put away a hot from point-blank 
range past senior goalkeeper Kami 
Poma. 

"That's the time tearns come 
after you," UCSD head coach 
Brian McManus said. "1\vo or 
three minutes after goals, they 
come out to get you." 

But the score became an after-
thought when freshman Kelly 
Cochran found fellow freshman 
Megan Dickey treaking across the 
top of the box. Dickey corralled the 
pass and put one across the goal 
line for a 4-1 advantage. Cal Sfate 
Dominguez \ Jills scored a goal 
again t itself to round out the scor-
ing. 

The Triton for. ... ards were more 
than a match for the taggering 
Toro defense. The combination of 
Harrelson's play in the air, 
Cochran's peed up the field and 
Jones' all-around experienced game 
was too much for the Toros. 
McManus utilized each of his three 
forwards effectively. He started the 

game with Harrelson and Jones up 
top. They were both all over the 
field , so McManus subbed out 
J ones in the first half, giving her a 
much-needed breather, and pushed 
up Cochran. 

Midway through the second 
half, McManus subbed Jones back 
in for Harrelson, rewarding the 
rwo-goal scorer for her tenaciou 
play. 0 matter the combination, 
the Cal State Dominguez Hills 
defense had no answers. 

UC D reached the finals of 
the four-team tournament by 
beating Sonoma tate 1-0 on ov. 
7 in the semifinals. They fini hed 
CC play with an overall record 
of 14-2 and another championship 
banner. 

Their regular season record and 
C AA ritle were good enough to 
earn a home field bid to start the 
first round of the NCAA Divi ion 
J] playoffs. ft i the 13th year in a 
row that the U D women's team 
has hosted at least one round of the 
NCAA tournament. 

It is the 18th straight trip to the 
CAA tournament for U D, 

which has qualified ever since the 
N AA began holding a national 
champion hip at the Di\;sion III 
level in 19 6. The Tritons have five 
national titles in the Division 111 
level and two from their first two 
years since entering Di~ision II in 
2000. 

Their first game will be again t 
fellow CCAA member Cal State San 
Bernardino on ov. 15. After play-
ing a hectic schedule filled with 
make-ups leading up to the CCAi\ 
playoff, the Triton earned a few 
days off. 

"Hopefully we can handle the 
rest," McManus said. "We're not 
used to it."
