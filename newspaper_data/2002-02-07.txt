All on .. campus residents may 
be required to buy ':Ileal plan 
H&DS plan c~lls for uniform student housing prices 
By MARGARET O'NEILL 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD Housing and Dining 
Services is contemplating a change 
to a controversial "one-contract, 
one-rate" plan for undergraduate 
hou ing that would begin next year. 

If enacted, the pla-n would 
charge sUldents the same price for 
living in residence halls 3nd apart-
ment and require all on-campus 
residents to purchase a meal plan. 
All single rooms would cost one 
price and all double rooms would 
cost another, regardless of their 
location. 

One of the goals of the plan, 
according to H&DS Director Mark 
Cunningham, would be to unify the 
freshman experience, because an 
increasing number of freshman are 
being housed in on-campus apart-
ments instead of the traditional res-
idence halls. 

Under the proposed plan, all 
students living in on-campus hous-
ing would be required to buy a 
minimum meal plan. Weekly clean-
i ng service of the common areas 
would be provided for the apart-
ments, as it is currently provided 
for the residence halls. 
Cunningham said H&DS is also 
considering increasing resident

one-contract program would sim-
plify housing applications for stu-
dents and parents.

said. "Everybody can understand

A.S. receives 
over S lOOK for 
outreach efforts 
New Student Initiated Outreach 
and Recruitment Commision set up 
By GEOFF DIETRICH 
News Editor 

[n what is described by many 
students as a much-anticipated 
and appreciated step in develop-
ing new forms of educational out-
reach, $119,000 was transferred 
from the Office of Student Affairs 
to tile A.S . Council of UCSD on 
Feb.5 . 

The long-awaited transfer 
means the A.S. Council has 
more resources to fund individ-
ual students and student groups 
who seek to increa~e awareness 
and enrollment an long under-
represented high school stu-
dents. 

The Student Iniliated 
Outreach and Recrui tment 
Commission was established last 
month to disperse the funds to 
students and student organiza-
tions performing outreach in 
local high schools. 

"['m very optimistic this will 
be a positive way for A.S. and 
SIORC to make an impact on 

diversity on tllis campus," sa id 
A.S President Jeff Dodge. 

Funds could go to a variety of 
areas, ranging from high school 

conferencc~ to tutoring pro-
grams,' said A.S. Vice PreSIdent 
External Dylan de Kervor. 

" ew and innova ti ve idt:a\ 
that are completely student-run 
and initiated will receive fund-
ing," de Kervor said . "Vie are also 
looking to su pport programs that 
are already in place." 

The fund s are part of a 
statewide prograll1using outreach 
to increase the enrollment of 
underrepresented minorities ill 
the UC system. 

"IThe funds arel going to go to 
schools and st\ldent~ froll1 under-
reprt:sented backgrounds," ~aid 
Bud i\1cahan, director of Center 
for Research in Educational Equi ty 
and Teaching Excellence. "The 
idea is to work with those schoob 
and better prepare lheir students 
for tllis university."

Che Cafe still at odds 
with administration 
Representatives of the cafe say the 
shed wjll obstruct their garden 
By KIRSTEN HUBBARD 
Staff Writer 

SUldents representing tile Chc 
Cafe are still working on negotia-
tions with UCSD Grounds and 
Landscapes Services concerning 
the placement of a storage shed 
and containers behind the Che 
Cafe. 

The shed will take the place of 
several smaller storage containers 
previously situated in the same 
general area. Those that oppose tile 
shed's placement fear that the new 
shed will decrease area parking, 
block access to the organic garden 
behind the cafe and intensify traffic 
to the area. 

Kris Bohling, a graduate Shl-
dent in the music department, 
sa id the cafe has received a writ-
ten respon e regarding the stor-
age hed. 

He said the written response 
did not include any new conces-
sions, which the Che Cafe was 
anticipating. He felt that Grounds 
and Landscapes Services were im-
ply reiterating statements they 
made before, such as the promi e 
that the hed will only be tempo-
rary. The respon e did not contain 

a date that the storage container 
will be removed. 

"Their biggest fear is that the 
shed will be there forever," said 
Chuck lvlorgan , manager of 
Grounds and Landscapes 
Services. "This is not true." 

The response contained 
other details. For example, it 
states that the shed will not 
block access to the cafe's organic 
garden. 

Bohling remained firm in his 
stance that the hed would be a 
nuisance to the cafe. 

"The shed will still be wedged 
up against the main path to the 
gar<len," he said . 

The memo also claimed that 
the cafe's strucnlre will not he 
altered. Originally tllere was a 
possibility the Che Cafe would be 
subject to drilling for pipes and 
wires to conduct electricity. 
However, Bohling said such an 
agreement was already made, and 
that the promise means nothing 
new to the cafe.

UCI r~port links eating 
disoraers to poor lighting 

Scientists at UC Irvine's School of Social Ecology 
have recently published a study that yielded results 
linking darkness to binge-eating. 

Joseph Kasof, a psychology professor at UCI, dis-
covered that dieting individuals were more likely to 
display binge-eating behavior if they prefer to eat in 
darker lighting climates. Results from the study 
expand on Kasofs earlier wor~ which showed peo-
ple exhibiting "evening" lifestyles as being more 
prone to bulimic behavior than people who are 
mainly adive during the daytime. 

Four hundred students (rom UCLA were I,lsed as 
subjects for the test 

Binge-eating affeds more than six million 
Americans every year. 

Scientists discover method to 
reduce size of computer chips 

The Materials Science Division of the Lawrence 
Berkeley National Laboratory has made develop-
ments with nanowire electronics that could allow 
computer chips to become smaller than one-hun-
dredth the width of a human hair. 

Researchers have discovered a way to combine 
different materials along the length of a single 
nanowire, imitating techniques used in manufactur-
ing semicondudors. According to the development 
a single nanowire could be a complete device itself 
and could incorporate transistor jundions,light-emit-
ting diodes and even lasers. 

The new technologies could virtually make elec-
tronic devices such as computer chips into one-
dimensional objects by using the nanowire strudure. 

The Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation, the 
3M Corporation, the National Science Foundation, 
the u.s. Department of Energy and UC Berkeley pro-
vided funding for the project The report can be 
found in its entirety in the February issue of 
American Chemical Society's Nona Letters. 

Survey shows increase in 
non credentialed teachers 

UCLA launched a new online journal Feb. 5 
intended to identify deficiencies in the quality of 
schools in Los Angeles, particularly schools with lower 
socioeconomic status serving minority communities. 

This month's issue of "Teaching to Change LA" 
focuses primarily on the inequality of qualified teach-
ers serving schools throughout California. According to 
"TCLA· schools with minority enrollment accounting 
for more than 75 percent of students have 22 percent 
of their faculty teaching without a credential. In schools 
with less than 30 percent of their ' population com-
posed of minority students, only 5 percent of the 
teachers instruct without state credentials. 

The situation in Los Angeles County is more 
severe, according to 'iClA,' where over 300 ele-
mentary schools employ faculties made up of at 
least 30 percent noncredentialed teachers. 

"TCLA" is a production of UCL.};s Institute for 
Democracy, Education, and Access and recruits 
teachers and parents of K-12 students in urban 
schools as contributing writers.

Housine:: 
One-contrad wirrequire the 
expansion of dining facilities 
Continued from page 1 

whi le the price of living in the on-
campus aparonents has remained 
relatively stable. T his year, a sru-
dent living in a double room in the 
residence halls with the least 
expensive meal plan ($2, 160) pays 
$7,630 for the school year. Und~r 
the one-contract plan, a resident in 
the same room next year will pay 
$7,100, including a $1,800 meal 
plan. 

A resident in a double room in 
an on-campus apartment currently 
pays $4,363. Under the one-con-
tract plan, a resident in the same 
room next year will pay the same 
$7,100 as a student in a residence 
hall, including the $1,800 meal 
plan. 

If this plan is not implemented, 
rates will increase across tlle board, 
but by a higher amount for resi-
dence halls. A resident in a double 
rOOIl1 with a $2,160 meal plan in 
the residence halls will pay $8,088 
in 2002-2003, and a resident in a 
double room in an apartment will 
pay $4,687. 

Cunningham said that the goal 
of the plan is to provide additional 
amenities in exchange for the high-
er ra t~s . 

"The whole theory was to give 
[residents] sOlnething back and not 
ju t raise rates," he said. 

The plan itself wou ld cost 
H&DS a great deal to implement. 
Dining facilities would have to be 
renovated to deal with the larger 
number of students they would be 
serving. Additional custodial per-

sonne� would be hired to clean 
a partments once a week. 

Cunningham said a dining facil -
ity of some sort would be set up in 
the Pepper Canyon/Mathews 

Apartments area. 
The proposal, which was devel-

oped by H&DS, was presented to 
the college provosts and recently 
the resident advisers. 

The one-contract plan met with 
mixed opinions from RAs and sru-
dent leaders. Sierra Catcott, 
Thurgood Marshall College 
sophomore senator to the A.S. 
Council, is against the plan. 

Catcott said she believes equal-
izing the price will not mean living 
in the apartments and living in the 
residence halls COStS the same for 
students. 

According to Catcott, the fewer 
residents per apartment automati-
cally means that they will pay more 
than a group of students living in 
residence halls, who she said would 
be splitting costs between a larger 
number. 

"The apartment is still going to 
be more expensive to live in than 
the res halls," she said. "The living 
situa ti ons are not going to be 
equaled through this contract." 

Some RAs believe the plan will 
be beneficial for next yea r's resi-
dents. 

Amanda Wallace is an RA in the 
Marshall Uppers Apartments, 
which houses all freshmen this 
year. She served on the H&DS 
Advisory Board for two years and 
said she understands that some-
thing must be done to equalize 
prices, because residence hall prices 
are rising much faster than apart-
ment prices. 

Wallace sa id most vf her current 
residents live in apartments and 
have a meal plan, and that having a 
meal plan makes tlle transition to 
college easier. 

The required meal plan is one of 
the most debated aspects of the new 
plans. It would require sophomores 
in the on-campus aparnnents to 
have a meal plan as well .

delayed for weeks. 

"We already ordered tlle shed

"Now we can't have them deliv-

Racial initiative 
riddled with 
flaws in logic 

UC Regent \Na rd Connerly, the man 
behind the highly controversial decision in 
the 1990s to eliminate the lise of affirmative 
action in admission to the University of 
California, has proposed the "Racial Privacy 
Initiative." 

The initiative, if passed, will enact an 
amendment to California's state constitution 
that will effectively prohibit classifying "any 
indil'idual by race, ethn icity, color or nation-
al origin in the operation of public education, 
public contracting or public employment" 
\\'ithin the state of Ca ~iforni a, with limited 
eXl:eptions for law enforceme nt and low-
income housing. 

However, it seems that this proposal ta r-
gets the admissions proces es of public edu-
cation institutions in Cali forn ia, as the ini tia-
til'e explicitly states it cannot super ede fed-
eral employment laws requiring the collec-
tion of racia l stati ti cs. 

In real te rms, this would mean the elimi-
nation of check boxes for self- identification of 
race on UC applications. However, the pro-
posal makes provisions for an exception on 
racial data collection for inmates, which leads 
to an interesting question: If we are collect-
ing racial data to correct social injustices in 
our criminal system, why would we wish to 
stop collecting data to address inequalities 
and ill representation in the public w,jversi-
ti es of California? 

While the Gum·dian recognizes the possi-
ble discomfort witl, being individually associ-
ated with one's race on a government form, 
the di scontinuation of the procedure would 
make it more difficult to address racial 
inequaliti es rather than create a race-blind 
system altogether. 

Student organizations such as the Student 
Affirmative Action Committee depend on 
reliable statistics to make their case about 
racial misrepresentation in the UC student 
body. 

Without undisputed data, the credibility of 
their claims would be undermjned. 
Furthermore, since race is no longer a deter-
mining fa ctor in admissions, the proposed 
change would have only a psychological ben-
efi t, in contrast with the real consequences of 
the statistical collection mess that would be 
created. 

In short, as much as we've progressed, race 
is still an i sue tI,at needs to be addressed . 
While creating a race-blind society is 
admirable and even desirable presently for a 
great many UC stuclents , there would be no 
altemative statistical method as reliable as ask-
ing every student who applied to the UC sys-
tem to provide their race at their discretion. 

T he Guardian opposes this initiative in the 
hopes that a race-blincl university sy tern will 
eventually be achieved through the careful 
tabulation and directed actions aimed at a 
more complete representation of California's 
population.

"YOU CAN7 ESCAPE, LAY!" 

Prisoners of hypocrisy: U.S. fails 
to act justly toward detainees 
The United States must obey international law in 

accordance with the rules of the Geneva Convention 
By ED WU 
Senior Staff Writer 

J apanese-Americans fought bravel y 
in Europe for the Allies during World 
War II , as did many Japanese in the 
Phil ippines. Those fighting in 
Japanese-controlled territory were 
almost unfailingly tried for treason by 
their home country. Should these sol-
diers have been treated differently from 
any other American combatants? 

In the Vietnam War, American pris-
oners, including now-Sen. John 
McCain, were subjected to torture and 
starvation at the hands of the North 
Vietmanese for fighting in a foreign 
country. Should these detainees have 
fa ced such abuses for participating in 
combat they believed was just? Any 
claim besides a negative would of 
course be condemned as a barbaric, 
backward stance. 

Then consider this : Why is 
American-turned-Taliban John Walker 
Lindh facing charges handed down by a 
federal grand jury Tuesday? Why have 
there been whispers of executing 
Walker Lindh for his involvement in 
Afghani stan? Why does America refuse 
to recognize 158 "unlawful" combat-
ants now imprisoned at a U .S. military 
base in Cuba as "prisoners of war" who 
all have proper civil rights guarantees? 

The hypocrisy of the prisoner-of-
war situation is apparent upon inspec-
tion. The United States is indefinitely 
holding more than 100 men at the 
Guantanamo Bay base in Cuba. The 
Department of Defense refers to these 
men a "detainees" rather than "prison-
ers of war." There are legal implica-
tions of such a status: guaranteed civil 
ri ghts , the ability to hear charges 
again st them, and a rCnlTll to their 
respective countries once hostilities 
Stop. The contention of th e 
Department of Defense is that since 
these men were fighting not for a coun-
try but for al-Qaeda, their actions were 
unlawful and thus the preferred title is 
"unlawful combatants." 

Oddly enough , international hostili -
ti es have legal and illegal sides by this 
argument. OK, lct's play by that. 

Ameri can troops have fought in 
many "wars" without any legal decl ara -
tion of war by Congress: Think of 
Colombia, Nicaragua, Vi etnam, Bosni a 
and Iraq. Does that mean American 
troops captured under such conditions 
should not be afforded the protections 
of the Geneva Convention of 1949? 
That they should not be treated 
humanely and not be allowed to return 
to the United States after hostilities 
cease? 

Proponents of U .S. policy would 
argue that since we're always on the 
side of morality and justice; combat we 
engage in should be classified as legal 

Regardless of how 
humanely the prisoners in 

Cuba are treated, the 
situation sets a dangerous 

precedent for the 
international community, 

because it implies the 
country doing the 

detaining, rather than 
international convention, 
should dictate the rights 

and conditions afforded to 
the prisoners. 

by the international community and 
our soldiers therefore afforded the 
same protections outside of congres-
sionally a pproved combat. 

Yet the United States was criticized 
by the United Nations for its military 
incursions into South America during 
the 1980s, and for air strikes against 
Iraq in the past decade. 

The United States makes a policy of 
not seeking international approval for 
its military actions, for fear of being 
beholden to them. Proof of this can be 
een in the recent conflict 111 

Afghanistan . 
The United Nations would have 

supported the commencement of hos-

tilities in Afghanistan ; Secretary of 
Defense Donald Rumsfcld and the rest 
of the Bush admini stration said they 
would not do so because U.S . military 
incursions required no support or 
approval fTom the international com-
munity. The only times the United 
States actually adhered to international 
standards of conduct governing hostili -
ties - by bringing the issue before the 
United Nations and getting the 
approval of member states - were the 
Korean and Persian Gulf wars . 

As a result, the classification of the 
"detainees" as "unlawful combatants" is 
absurd. U .S. soldiers could easily have 
been labeled "unlawful combatants" in 
every conflict since Korea with ' the 
exception of the Persian Gulf War. 

Regardless of how humanely the 
prisoners in Cuba are treated, the sim-
ation sets a dangerous precedent for the 
international community because it 
implics the country doing the detain-
ing, rather than international conven-
tion, should dictate the rights and con-
ditions afforded to the prisoners . 

Furthermore, while the United 
States argues for humane treatment of 
China's detention of its own citizens, it 
has placed its own "detainees" in open-
air cages made Out of a square of fenc-
ing covered by a tin roof. 

International standards for humane 
trea tment of all prisoners, foreign or 
domestic, is key to a civilized interna-
tional 'society, and the United. States' 
open flouting of any standard is shame-
ful and dangerous. 

So why is the United States any dif-
ferent in its handEi'6 of its prisoners 
than the rest of the international com-
munity? Horrendously enough, it 
comes down to two words: "We can." 
No country whose nationals are impris-
oned in Cuba has the economic clout to 
impose sanctions on the United States 
for disregarding international law. If a 
civilized society is governed by the fact 
that it adheres to moral principles 
rather than what it can and cannot get 
away with, the United States has obvi-
ously failed the test.

5 O PI NION THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Desperately seeking Dynes Posse 

neurotica 
" ,,' ' DIVYA RUNCl;lAL 

P opular sentim~nt holds that UCSD 
students are a bunch 
of boring individuals 
who spend too much 
time cooped up study-
ing in the library and 
not enough time at 
the beach. 

I know this because I am a self-
professed library nerd - except I 
never do work, I just waste my 
time writing e-mails and checking 
up on the latest gossip spreading 
around Hollywood. I know this is 
not completetly true, though; I 
have proof of it. Two words: 
Dynes Posse. 

You see, I feel the Dynes 
Posse, these mysterious individu-
als who creep in the shadows of 
dre night to put pictures of 
Chancellor Robert C. Dynes 
around campus, are completely 
underrated and unappreciated. I 
also feel that they inject a certain 
level of glamour into a campus 
that is highly devoid of it. 

I have taken it upon myself to 
spread the gospel of the Dynes 
Posse even though I don't really 
know who they are or, more 
specifically, what their purpose 
is. But in an era in which numer-
ous faceless ads infiltrate class-
room walls, isn't it comforting 
that a group of strangers is mak-
ing sure that we know that 
Dynes is always there when we 

need him? Nevermind that his 
mug is predominantly on trash 
cans - I think Dynes should feel 
honored that some students have 
taken it upon themselves to make 
him more of a "mini celebrity" 
than he already is. 

Of course, some students may 
wish for supermodel Giselle's 
voluptuous curves to be posted 
all over campus instead , but 
Dynes (as our all-powerful, if 
unseen presence on campus) is a 
pretty decent replacement. And 
it may be true that the Dynes 
Posse cannot do justice to th~ 
man's excellent features (OK, so I 
have a little crush on him), but 
they do a pretty damn good job 
attempting it: 

A few readers may be asking 
themselves, "What the hell is she 
talking about? Who is the Dynes 
Posse?" I'll tell you, you naive 
individuals. The Dynes Posse 
are why I know God exists. They 
don't take themselves too seri-
ously, they aren't enormously 
self-promoting and better yet, 
they don't try to recruit mem-
bers shamelessly. If that's not 
Mother Teresa-like, I don't know 
what is. 

I know they must like their 
anonymity, but I have taken it 
upon myself to proclaim to the 
world that I am madly in love with 
them. They are exciting, they take 
risks (they could be arrested for 
vandalism by the UCSD police 
department for God's sake!) and 
they are excellent at sprucing up 
rather boring concrete walls. 
(Imagine what they could do for 
Geisel's decor.) 

I have even gone so far as to 
try to recruit members for the 
"Dynes Posse Fan Club" (of 
course, once we hit it big, we'll 
have to pick a more original 

THE NEWEST IN LA JOLLA 
THE FINEST IN CALIFORNIA 

name), but they've all declined . 
They say they don't understand 
what's so great about a bunch of 
hooligans who deface publ ic 
property. Obviously, they're the 
individuals I was referring to in 
the beginning of this column. 
They also say that Dynes is 
probably irritated (not flattered 
as I suggest) by all the attention 
he is getting from the group and 
psychotic individuals like me. 

Being the stubborn 
Capricorn that I am, (does any-
one know Dynes' sign, by the 
way?) I refuse to be shattered by 
their ridiculous criticism and 
have taken it upon myself to start 
a one-woman campaign to sup-
port the Dynes Posse (whoever 
these gorgeous hooligans are) 
and draft a proposal to make 
them the official mascots of 
UCSD (I'm sorry folks, but 
we're tarnishing our reputation 
with the association with "The 
Little Mermaid" - The Triton 
has got to go.) After all, the 
posse represents UCSD's finest . 
They're creative, brave (it's kind 
of difficult eluding UCSD's 
highly trained police officers) 
and most of all, they're doing 
something even the best public 
relations firm couldn't do : 
increase Dynes' marketability. 

Of course, even my own family 
members have pointed out that 
the Dynes Posse, if they even 
wanted a deranged fan, would pre-
fer someone more modelesque 
and less Rubenesque. But as their 
No.1 fan, I'm sure they'll eventu-
ally warm up to me. Hopefully, by 
then I'll have at least recruited 10 
members of the DPFC (Dynes 
Posse Fan Club) and participated 
in at least one excursion with these 
adventurous artists. One can 
always hope, right?

Editor: 
I would like to poinr out some 

serious discrepancies found in A.S. 
President Jeff Dodge's attack on 
Ryan Darby Feb.4, 2002. If he is 
trying to set the record straight, he 
has, unfortunately, only served to 

confuse tile issue at hand. 
First, Dodge resorted to >care 

tactics by referri ng to Darby", 
"conservatively extreme." Darby IS 
conservative, ves, but not 
extreme. Being conservative is no 
more extreme than being liberal, 
and Dodge should not tty to dis-
credit Darby solely beca use he is 
conservative. 

Second, Dodge claims 111> only 
problem with the Pro-America 
Resolution was the title, beca use 
the A.S. Council tries to be "as 
politically neutral and nonpartisan 
as possible. " I have a hard ti me 
believing Democrats and 
Republicans in Congress and in 
Sacramento find the term "Pro-
America " partisa n in any way. 

True, the Freedom Alli ance 
hosted a Pro-America Rall y, but 
the College Democrats were invi t-
ed to take part in hosting the rall y 
and declined . Furthermore, the 
rally remained politically neutral. 

Dodge did not attend the rally, 
but he did attend the Affi rmative 
Action Rally shortly after and, 
along with Vice President Internal 
Jenn Brown, wore T-shirts handed 
out by event organizers with pro-
affirmative action maxims on them. 
Affirmative action is quite pos ibly 
one of the most partisan issues in 
California and has Democrats and 
Republicans highly split over the 
issue. I understand that Dodge and 
many UCSD student.~ favor affir-
mative action, but that does not 
make it a nonpartisan issue. 

Dodge contradicts himself by

Lindh: 
us must act justly 
toward prisoner 
Continued from page 4 

The Walker Lindh situation 
seems to be the more ambiguous 
of the two. After all, this man has 
raised arms aga inst his own 
country. T he difficulty, however, 
is that he has not done so on U.S. 
soil. I [ow can America have any 
jurisdiction over his actions in 
Afghanista n? 

T here is a clear difference 
between terrorism and war, wi th 
the formcr taking place on 
domestic soi l. This, as oam 
Chomsky aptly points Oll t, makes 
the United States a terrorist in a 
grea t many countries. 

To treat Walker Lindh differ-

R RUSSELL ATHLETIC 1902 
FOR THE LON .(l RU N. 

ently from the rest of the fight-
ers for the Taliban because of his 
origins is absurd . Though iron-
ically enough, his present situa-
tion - - faced with lifetime 
imprisonment and many law-
maker~ calling for his head, yet 
with real charges agai nst him in 
front of a real court - is better 
than that of his 158 colleagues. 

So what should be done in 
accord ance with international 
law? Men who fought for the 
Taliban and al-Qaeda should be 
returned to their countries of 
origin when hostilities cease, 
with the proper consequences of 
government monitoring from 
their respective countries of ori -
gin. 

Meanwhile, as a principled 
and moral country that bel ieves 
in universal standards of human-
ity, the United States would do

well to afford them the same 
conditions as any other inmate 
oli domestic soil. 

The United States can also set 
an example with Walker Lindh. 
Here we have a man who has 
committed no domestic terror-
ism, has not shown himself to 
attempt such an act, and who is 
obviously cut off from any terror-
ist support network. Imprisoning 
him for several years while the 
terrorist mess clears up, followed 
by a deliverance to his family or to 
whatever Muslim country he 
wishes to emigrate. Allowing him 
to live out the rest of his life like 
any other retired soldier would be 
the humane and rational thing to . 
do. 

Unfortunately, the United 
States has yet to show that it can 
act in such a manner with respect 
to armed combat.

saying, "Direct affiliation to a par-

Dodge also complains that 
Darby'S article frames him as "un-
American" and compares him to 
communist and socialist leaders. 
Not once in the article does the 
phrase "un-American" appear, and 
there are no allusions to any leaders

Alliance are working on together at 
UCSD. It looks to me that Dodge 
is provoking the extreme sensa-

tiona�ism of which he wrongly 
accuses Darby. Hypocrisy or irony: 
Take your pick. 

Finally, Dodge specl!lates that 
the Freedom Alliance and the 
GUIlrdian are in cahoots to defame 
Dodge and his A.S. Council bud-
dies before election time at the end 
of this quarter. Of course, that is 
ridiculous. 

I personally cannot help specu-
late that Dodge is engaged in 
vicious and deceitful name-calling 
to detract from his sketchy involve-

"Second-years who are going to

food available at the food courts," 
Catcott said. " It is often much

Catcott said that it would be

said that this would be problematic

Outreach: 
Funding aimed to prompt 
student involvement 
Continued from page 1 

W hat makes these funds unique 
is that students not only have the 
fina l say in how they are used, but 
the funds are theirs to use, as 
opposed ro belonging to a depart-
ment Clf the Ulliversity. 

"We've entered into an agree-
ment with A.S. for the administra-
tion of the funds in what is based 
on three months of negotia tions," 
sa id Edward Spriggs, assistant vice 
chancellor in charge of financial 
management for the Student 
Affairs office. "We want A.S. and 
students to assume responsibility 
and accountabi lity for the funds." 

Increased sl1ldent involvement 
is seen by many as a more effective 
outreach. 

"The more we get students 
involved, the better off we will be," 
Meahan said. 

College students are a valuable 
resource in outreach and recruiting 
because tlley are more knowledge-
able about high school students' 
needs than faculty and staff, 
Meahan said. 

Sl1Idents are encouraged to par-
ticipate in all levels ofSIORC from 
the committee stages and in actual 
outreach involvement, Dodge said. 

Interaction between the A.S. 
Council, students and the adminis-
tration is a key component of the 
outreach sttategy. 

"Any time you put a chunk of 
change ~.hat large into a student 
organization you have a certain 
amount of trust," Spriggs said. "We 
have every reason to believe it will 
result in an increase of the number 
[of minority students] coming to 

beneficial for residents, but it has 
its downfalls. 

"As someone who has lived in 
both, it is sad to see residential life 
take such a parental view over stu-
dents," Lieberknecht said. "The 
apartments used to be a wonderful 
transition to living on one's own. 
Unfortunately, that is being taken 
away." 

Most of the housing currently 
under construction and planned for 
the future is apartments, according 
to Cunningham said. 

Catcott critiaized the construc-
tion of apartments if H&DS is not 
going to all ow residents to fully uti-
li ze thei r amenities. 

Many RAs and members of A.S. 
COlincil . expressed that 
Cunningham did not all ow for 
enough student input on the pro-
gram. 

"1 think the proposition is a 
good idea in many ways, but it's 
unforl1lnate that it came into play 
so late in the game," Wallace said. 
"I just wish there could have been 
more discus ion to perfect this 
idea." 

Licberknecht called for an acnl-
al contract to be produceu so that 
people would have something to 
look at before they start to argue.

SIORC consists of committees, 

which will effectively run the fund-

committee will oversee the day-to-
day operations. 

The core committee will evaluate 
funding requests. Representatives of 
each of the fi ve Student Affirmative 
Action Committees and of other stu-
dents who commit to the cOJrunis-

The SAAC organizations playa 
large role in SIORC because of their 
historic and traditional emphasis on 
outreach, de Kervor said. 

Membership in the core com-
mittee is open to all students who 
attend 70 percent of the meetings 
for two quarters in a row, but the

seat if they do not do the same, 
Dodge said. 

The administrative committee 
is made up of representa tives of the 
Office of Student Affairs, 
C.R.EAT.E. and Early Academic

funding is not overlapped with 
efforts from other outreach depart-
ments on campus.

needs to quit delaying and get the 
actual contract out to the public," 
Lieberknecht said. ''It is time for 
the theoretical debate to stop and 
the actual plan to surface. It is not 
fair to residents, RAs and HAs to 
not know what they are getting 
into next year, especially at this 
time of preparing for living situa-
tions and applying for RAlHA 
positions." 

Cunningham stressed that the 
decision has not yet been made. If 
the plan is to ta ke effect next year, 
a decision will need to be made 
soon; information for housing for 
continuing students has typically 
already been distributed by this 
point of winter quarte r, he said. 

"Timing is probably going to 
end up driving the whole decision," 

unningham said. 
Cunningham said customer ser-
'~ce is his primary goal. 

"Our bOtlom line is, it doesn't 
do us any good to tick off the cus-
tomer," he said. "If the community 
doesn't have time to process [the 
onc-contract plan] and comlllenr 
on it, then Wt! will have to lIlove on

posals, which in return advises the 
AS Council on the Illatter. It is the 
counc il that ultimately approves or 
disapproves funding requests. 

SIORC's funding came from the 
state - California's Assembly Bill 
1287 allots $1 million for snldcnt-
initiated outreach. 

"This is a great opportunity 
being given to snldents by the state 
that recognizes [the students'] 
efforts," de Kervor said . 

The assembly allotted the 
money to the UC Office of the 

.President, which divided it among 
UC schools. From there it went to 
the Office of Student Affairs at 
UCSD, and the A.S. Counci l 
received the funds Tuesday.

resents a shift in focus toward 
more short- term programs that 
target students, in addition to 
schools and teachers, Spriggs said. 

"Getting UCS D students 
actively involved in outreach is ter-
rific, but I wish it was new money, 
not borrowed," Meahan said in ref-
erence to the state cutting 
C.R.E.A.T.E.'s budget in favor of 
more sl1ldent initiated outreach. 

Meahan said the state needs to 
devote more resources to all forms 
of outreach. 

Regardless of funding, all par-
ties agree that student-i nitiated 
outreach will have beneficial effects 
for the campus. Prospective Sl1l-
dents are said to have the most to 
gain . 

"In addition to fostering what 
has been happening, we are looking 
to fund additional opportunities," 
de Kervor said . "I encourage peo-
ple to be creative, to take, enjoy 
and use this opportuni ty."

Through ~he decades: a journey through pop culture from the 19505 into the future 
'50s 

----------------------------------------------

'60s '80s 

]S)'W(O)~~ l~~~~rRlp l~IWJI~ 
~ml~ T~rRl~$llf~~~ 

111e 19705: 1. A decade of decadence-
bad clothes, bad hair, bad music. 2. Sequel 
to the 1960s, continuing the political and 
sexual revolution. 3. A nation torn and 
divided, betrayed by a corrupt government 
and plagued by a faltering economy. 

What's your take? There is no defini -
tive picture of the era. If anything, the 
19705 was a decade of contradictions: 
conservative goverrunent and liberal 
activism, disilltisionment and decadence, 
revived religion and conspicuous con-
sumption . 

It was the age of Vietnam and 
Watergate, but also the age of disco and 
the happy face. It spawned films of dark 
visions such as "Apocalypse Now" and 
"Taxi Driver," but also feel -good fare such 
as uS tar Wars" and "Grease." 

What caused these contradictions and 
what were the ramifications? The answer 

lies in the political and economic 
atmosphere that 

shaped such cul -
ture , one 

w hie h 
pro -

voked 
Bob 

Dylan to sing, "the great American dream 
is over." 

Roots of disillusionme'nt 
Various political and economic factors 

. contributed to the awkward adolescence 
of America. In the 1970s the relatively sta-
ble post-war econonly finally collapsed 
and recession engulfed the nation, due to 
a massive energy crisis and stagflation - a 
mix of economic stagnation and high 
inflation. 

Meanwhile, the United States SOlm-
bled politically as .well : Ideological bat-
tles over the U.S. presence in Vietnam 
and Cambodia became physical when 
protesters dashed with police. Four Stu-
dents were kiUed at Kent State 
University and protests shut down 
Columbia University. 

The Wat(\fgate fiasco, resulting in 
President Richard Nixon's humiliating 
resignation,_and the Iranian takeoyer of its 
U .S. embassy, in which President Jimmy 
Carter was powerless, severely shook the 
public's raith in government. 

Conflicts over desegregation wracked 
the nation, ironically during Americas 
bicentennial. The United States, which had 
emerged victorious with the Allies after 
World War n, was now suddenly a stum-
bling giant - unable to follow through 
with its war against the South Vietnamese, 

u~1ble to escJpe recession and unable to 
deal with its own civil discontent. 

A response to the distress was a 
determined push for movements, 

laws and reform. But America 
became less a melting pot than a 

salad bowl, upholding diversity 
as its new creed. 

'90s beyond 

'That's the Way I Like It' 
The 1970s were as much about enjoy-

ing oneself as helping others, if not more 
so. In contrast to the 1960s' optimistic and 
altruistic idealism, the 1970s celebrated 
jaded hedonism. People were not only 
participating in liberation movements, but 
liberating themselves from older ways of 
conduct. Sexual promiscui ty bec'lme more 
visible and acceptable for women. Cned 
dorms sprang up and cohabilation was on 
the rise. Celebrities lived it up and gOt 
high at Studio 54. 

Fashion became informal and outra-
geous. Even those who hadn't liked hip-
pies began to dress like them; by 1979, the 
police in Des Moines, Iowa, sported long 
hair, beards and mustaches. The clean-cut 
look was out, and bell bottoms, platfo rm 
shoes and b azmg colors were in. Men 
could dress like women - or androgy-
noiisly in the cases of glam rock artists 
Queen and David Bowie - and women 
could dress like men , such as Diane 
Keaton in "Annie Hall." 

Others opted to transform themselves 
through sel f-discovery. Some' headed fo r 
the mountains and formed commu nes and 
collectives, turning to environmentalism 
rather than politics. 

Some turned to religion or new age 
practices. A religious reviva l swe pt the 
nation, invigorating Judaism as well as 
evangelical Christianity. "New age," a term 
for non-Western philosophies or belief in 
the superoattll'3l, also swept the nation for 
those Wl5.1tisfied with traditional religions. 
New-agers could embrace Zen Buddhism, 
yoga, the I Ching, Wicc3, holistic medicine

A 'hungry' Arnold Schwarzenegger talks about his life in film 
The burly actor discusses his new film, the drug war, his politics and the future of film projects, including '13' 
By CHARLIE TRAN 
Hiatus Editor 

A m old Schwarzcnegger's new film "Collateral Damage" hits thcaters this week. 
Schwar1.cnegger plays a fireman who 
hunts down Colombian terrorists 
afrer his family was kil led in a terror-
ist bombing. The film was originally 
sched uled for October, but was halt-
ed after tl1e Sept. II terrorist atucks. 
Schwarzeneggcr recently talked 
about the film and funlre projects: 

Q: What does the title of the 
film mean to you? 
A: I don't think it matters what it 
means to mc. I think internationally, 
the lill11 as "Colla teral Damage" 
means damage that has been done to 
innocent people; it has nothing to 
do with the actual war. Like Sept. 
II, everyone in the World Trade 
Center was collateral damage 
because of the disagreements 
hctwecn th e terrorists and our gov-
ernment. l one of those people had 
anything to do with terrorism or the 
war. I think very few people have 
PJid attention to collateral damage. 

Q: Why do you feel that now is 
an appropriate time to show the 
film to the public? 
A: It's not up to me to feel tha~ it's 
an appropriate time. What matters 
is what the people feel. .. . We test-
ed the audience in November and 
everyone felt that this is tile time 
we should see this film . 

Q : What is your favori te philos-
ophy? 
A: There's scveral .. . but [ al ways 
believed in stayi ng hungry. I always 
felt that as soon as you accomplish 
something and climbed the hill that 
you wanted, to get therc, don 't rcst 
there. The wor t thing you can do 
is to Sil and enjoy tile victory. If you 
look at it as a stepping stone again 
and be hungry for tile next step you 
make . .. It 's important to pack in as 
much a you can and afterward, 
there's enough time to re t. 

Q: Do you have any political 
aspirations? 
A: Right now, [don't. I continue 
working with my after-schoo l pro-
grams, the City Games. I'm work-
ing on an initiative here in 

Cal ifornia that will be on the ballot 
in November, which is called the 
After School Education and Safety 
Act. 

I continue to push ror things 
important for kids who are power-
less. I like to represent people who 
are powerl ess, like the Special 
Olympics. 1 feel like I should fight 
for them. They never have a 
chance, so I do it for them . .. 

Arnold 
Schwarzenegger 

'Collateral 
Damage' 

There's no money avai lable because 
the politicians are always short-
sighted; they will only vote for 
things that they think will give 
them additional votes. 

Q: What do you tlunk of the 
U.S.-financed war on d rugs? Do 
you think it is effective? 
A: ['m not an expert in this, but I 

tI~ink the whol e drug issue i a 
complicated i ue because there ure 

some people who argue: Should we 
concen trate on wiping out the 
demand for drugs' And there are 
other people who think we should 
wipe out the supply of drugs. Well , 
which one should it be? Rarely 
does it get together and see we 
should wipe out both. 

Q: What do you tlUnk you have 
left to p rove a~ an actor? Are 
there any films you want to do? 
A: I think it wou ld probably be 
"Terminator 3" next. There are so 
many fi lms for people rather than 
just fo r myself. I think tllere were 
so many pcople in the last \0 years 
who have asked me : When's 
"Terminator 3" coming out? 

Q: What was it fi rst like, be ing a 
foreigner t rying to enter tile act-
ing business? What mad e you 
want t o be a movie star? 
A: Well, I always wanted to be a 
movie star when r was 15 years old. 
I also wanted to go to America as a 
kid. I was highly impresscd with 
the bridges, the 5 -lane freeways 
with tile big cars and fins sticking 
up ... a kid , you always wanted to 

say: "Wow, I want to be ~here!" As 
a kid on an Austrian farm, you start 
to get tired o f that. 

I was really serious and [ wanted 
to fo llow through with that. I knew 
bodybu ildi ng would get me to 
America because there is no way 
for an Austrian kid to gct the 
money to ever get to America .. . . I 
killed myself five hours every day in 
the gym . .. r had idols like Steve 
Reeves and Herschel Hawk that 
went from body-building champi-
onship to Hercules sta rs. . 

Now imagine, when [get off the 
boat and someone comes up to me 
five months later and says "r want 
YO ll to play [-]ercules in ' [-{ercules 
in New York"" I said "Oh, my 
God' This is amazing, it's actually 
true'" They ask me, an Austrian 
schiester. I told all my friends to 
come over here; "It's true you can 
become a star!" In reality, YOll look 
now, it's quite difficult.

Steady, methodical pacing throughout 
'Monster's Ball' worth the wait 
Thornton and Berry shine as an interracial couple 
brought together by misery and hopelessness 
By CHARLIE TRAN 
Hiatus Editor 

Watching "Monster 's Ball" is a slow, deliberate tl rocess, bur a richly rewa rding one. Understated in both 
tone and dialogue, the principal actors, Billy 
Bob T hornton and Halle Berry, shine as their 
characters deal with their dreadful lives. 

Set in rural Gcorgia, "Monster's Ball " 
sends a message not only about racism and 
prejudice, but also about despair, renewal and 
love. 

I-lank Grotowski (Thormon) is a death 
row correctional officer who is in charge of 
executi ng Lawrence Musgrove (Sean "P. 
Diddy" Combs). Working with Hank is his 
son Sonny (Heath Ledger) . 

H ank lives his life the way his racist and 
prej udicial father did. 

The execution adds to the growi ng 
despair and frustration for the con vier's wife, 
Leticia (Berry), and son, Tyrell. 

After a string of tragedies that forces I-bnk 
and Leticia together, they [orm a connection 
tha t neither knew coul d exist. However, 
Leticia doesn't know that it was Hank who 
performed her husband's cxecution. 

Ithough the film uses the tried-and-true 
sta r), o r th e butterfl y emergi ng from the 
cocoon, what sets it apart is the noncoll -
frontational approach that director Marc 
Forster applies. The resul ting film sends a 
strong message without needing a sledgcham -

REVIEW 

mer to force the audience into submission. 
Gossip that bo th Thornton and Berry wi ll 

receive many acting awards is no surprise. 
They show perfect chemistry, not of lustful 
lovers but of gradual acceptance. 

The connection doesn't fee l like a com-
pressed dramatization ro fit within the length 
of a standard fi lm. With scarce lines, both 
performers capture the essence of a real, 
methodical relationship brewing with all its 
trials and crrors. 

Even in thc climactic end, the film doesn't 
force a confrontation that neatly wraps 
evcrything up. The film leavcs questions 
about their love for each other - questions, 
thal in reality, exist all the time. 

Like all relationships, tile film is deeply 
touching and moving. It just requires a bit of 
time and patience to develop.

'Ghost World' leaves you 
speechless with wit, charm 
DVD features lack quality and quantity, 
but the solid film makes up the difference 
By CHARUE TRAN 
Hiatus Editor 

" G host World" is not anoth-
er teen movie . It is the 
antithesis of all the cliched, 

predictable teen dramas because 
it presents not only a disdain for 
ordinary pop culture, but also dis-
plays wit, charm and comedy. The 
film provides a perfect blend of 
both teen angst and contempt for 
modern culture without being 
overly redundant. 

Based on Daniel Clowes' 
comic "Ghost World" is a Story of 
two teen-agers, Enid (Thora 
Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett 
Johansson), who have just gradu-
ated from high school. In the eyes 
of everyone else in their commu-
nity, Enid and Rebecca are out-
casts. They rebel agai nst the 
norm and what tl1CY pcrceive as a 
shallow and empty world . This 
comi ng-of-age film provides 
sharp, cynical insight into the 
shallowness of our culture. 

Steve Buscemi complements 
the dynamic characters in his 
role as Seymour, a lonely man 
who has an obsession for old 78-
rpm records. He shines because 
his character conveys an inno-
cent and quiet quality with 
which the audience can sympa-
thize. 

Enid and Rebecca set up a 
prank on Seymour, but the joke is 
no longer funny when Enid 
befriends her potential victim. 

It's a shame that the DVD ver-

sion of "Ghost World" is no 
match for the actual film . 
Although the sound and video 
quali ty are fine, the extras are 
clearly lacking in both depth and 
quality. 

A film that is intelligent and 
offbeat demands eXtras like audio 
commentary and additional 
insights into the making of the 
film . A commentary with Clowes 
about the creation of "Ghost 
World" and his comics would 
have put this DVD over the top. 

However, the only eXtras pro-
vided are deleted scenes, a music 
video and a featurette. 

The deleted scenes or the 
DVD are fine, but don't add 
much to the experi ence. This also 
applies [0 th e music video; 
although fans of H ollywood 
would approach it, it doesn't 
make the film any berter. 

Although the extras in "Ghost 
World" are tninimal, the star of 
all DVDs is ultimately the quality 
of the actual film . "Ghost World" 
is a superb, enriching movie that 
stands out from the crowd. Just 
the film itself makes it worth pur-
chasing the DVD.

legacy of the 1970s 
Continued from page 9 
ent cultural and ethnic niches mir-
rored the situation in music. Rock, 
metal and punk became white terri-
tory; soul, funk and rap became 
black territory. Disco was the one 
new genre that didn't fit into either 
category. It was also the one cate-
gory that attempted to unify people 
rather than critique authority. 

Ridiculed years later, disco was 
ironically a controversial subject of 
its time. It originated in the.. pulsing 
dance music of discotheques, mostly 
gay New York clubs, which synthe-
sized disparate musical styles (funk 
and soul) and different cui tures 
(black, gay and Latin), integrating 
all into a community where the mar-
ginalized women, blacks, and gays 
could belong through dance. 

Bur as author BruceJ. Schulman 
notes, as rock became increasingly 
"white, male, and macho," a back-
bsh occurred: "Disco was hated 
witl1 more intensity than any other 
form of popular music before or 
since." \Nith whites hati ng disco 
and anti-assimilationist blacks, 
club-sponsored "disco sucks 
nights" and racial incidents ensued . 

Leading American artists stayed 
away, but British and Australian 
stars like the Bee Gees had no 
qualms about joining disco's foray 
into the mainstream. They helped 
"Sarurday Night Fever" become 
one of the most popular movies of 
the decade, although the movie is 
often remembered more for its 
whitewashed disco than its dark 
portrayal of American life.

there is good support for her claim. 
In this "new Hollywood, n rebel 
directors battled against profit-
hungry global conglomerates for 
artistic freedom in expressing their 
highly personal visions of society. 

The results were dark, often 
anti-Establishment masterpieces 
such as Francis Ford Coppola's 
"The Godfather" parts I and n, 
Roman Polanski's "Chinatown," 
and Martin Scorcese's "Mean 
Streets" and "Taxi Driver." 

These films all exposed the rot-
ten core of hypocrisy in American 
society, exemplified in "Taxi 
Driver's" violent, angry Travis 
Bickle, who is no better than the 
"scum" he wants to get rid of. 

Corporations fought back by 
acquiring film companies and by 
finding the mass-ma rket antidote 
to artistic cult films: the Hollywood 
blockbuster, which offered 
thrilling, escapist adventures, 
exemplified in Steven Spielberg's 
precedent-setting "Jaws" and 
George Lucas' "Star Wars." 

Laughing through the tears 
I f television is any indicator of the 

times, "I\\'A*S'II ," " All in the 
Family" an d "Sarurday Night Live" 
were tl1fee comedies tha t took the 
temperature of the 19705. 

"M*A'S'H" looked at a mobile 
army surgica l hospi tal staff's experi-
ences during the Korean War, 
infusing humor into the hell that 
was their life-mixing comedy, 
tragedy, life and death in its anti-
war message. It became hailed as 
one of the greatest television come-
dies of its time. 

"All in the Family" was another 
culmral thermometer of tl1e "lOs. 
With "uproarious urgency," as 
senior editor of "Rolling Stone" 
magazine David Wild reminisced, it 
dared to go where no telelfision 
show had gone before. It showcased 
the bigoted Archie Bunker and his 
devoted wife butting heads "'1th his 

HIATIJS 11 

liberal daughter and son-in-law over 
topics such as Vietnam, Watergate, 
racism, abortion, wife-swapping and 
even menopause. These taboo issues 
were so controversial that it took 
three years to get on the air, and 
even then, the first episodes were 
prefaced by a disclaimer. 

Then there was "Saturday 
Night Live." As producer Lome 
Michaels explained, "In '1 975 the 
country was ripe for a fresh 
approach, which made it possible 
for 'SNL' to come in and be hon-
est." It was indeed fresh - like 
"M*A*S*/-l" and "All in the 
Family," "SNL" featured social 
commentary, but crossed it with a 
weekly variety show format mixing 
outrageous skits, musical guests, 
celebrity hosts and news-bite send-
ups, whose irreverent attitude has 
continued to this day. 

The legacy of the 1970s 
The contradictions witl1in the 

stormy 1970s are not surprisi ng. A 
nation faced with all kinds of polit-
ical, economic and social problems 
responded in as man y differ ~11l 
ways as its different constituenu .. 
with serious critique, black hUlllo r, 
wanton violence, brash indulgcm:c, 
or apathy. Some turned back 
toward nostalgia, others turncd 
inward toward spi ritual therapy, 
and others turned ourward toward 
fitness, fun and fashion . 

In a twist of fate, happy faces, 
bell bottoms and platform shoes arc 
back in fashion in the 21st century. 
Wath nostalgia and the eternal quest 
for reinvention, it is easy to retain 
the fun from the 1970s and forget 
tllC failures. However, the terrible 
events and their effects linger on as 
well: distrust of government, disillu-
siorunent in the American dream, 
and defiant, cynical popcuI nrre. 

The 1970s were undoubtedly a 
time of transition, significantly 
shaping the American cultural 
landscape - or better or worse.

Center fielder center of offense 
Smith's bat nabs him Player of the Week 
By COURTNEY FIELD 
Staff Writer 

A double, a triple, three home 
runs, four runs, three stolen bases 
and 10 RBIs. With numbers like 
these in just four games, junior cen-
ter fielder Matt Smith dominates 
the field of hitting for the Triton 
baseball team. 

Smith, who bats second in the 
lineup, is performing at the top of 
his game and has earned California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Player of the Week honors. As a 
sophomore last year, he led the 
team in sacrifice bunts. This year 
he leads in most of the offensive 
categories, including at-bats, home 
runs and stolen bases. 

Head coach Dan O'Brien is 
pleased with Smith's performance 
so far this year, and looks to him 
as a team leader and ~xplosive hit-
ter. 

"We have a di fferent offensive 
approach this year," O 'Brien said. 
"Matt is one of our best players 
and always has been. In previous 
years, he was more of a quiet play-
er, laying down sacrifice bunts, but 
now he is no longer a secret 
weapon. The competition knows 
his strengths. We are looking to 
Matt to drive the ball for us this 
year. He is the kind of player every 
coach and teammate makes a com-
ment about after each practice and 
game because he works so hard." 

But this team captain'S early suc-
cess has not gone to his head. 

"Matt Smith the ball player has-
n't changed. He still is one of the 
hardest-working guys 1 know," 
commented sophomore catcher 
J eff Riddle. "He still gets to the 
field early and stays late. He is still 
a strong leader on the team. Matt is 
the same hard working, excellent 
ball player last year that he is this 
year." 

Trailing 4- 1 in the fifth inning 
against Point Lorna University last 
Friday, Smith smacked a three-run 
shot to tie the game. In the seventh, 
Smith came through again and 
blasted a solo shot to right field to 
even the score for a second time. 

The following day, the center 
fielder knocked a grand slam - his 
third home run in two games -

and Wilson-Hayden won both their

in the finals. In each other, the two 

against Concordia University to lift 
UCSD to an 11-5 victory. 

He went 4-£or-5 with a triple, a 
home run and five RBIs in the 
game. 

"I'm seeing the ball really well," 
Smith said. "When they throw me 
a good pitch, [ take advantage. On 
the grand slam, there was one out 
and I really was just looking for an 
up ball to hit a sacrifice fly, but I 
connected and the wind just took it 
out. t1 

In this four-game, three-day 
homestand, Smith went 9-for-17 -
a batting average of .529. His over-
all slugging percentage of .957 
proves that he is an offensive threat 
to all opposing teams. 

"Home runs 3re always exciting 
in a game, especially when we need 
the runs, bur it is what Matt does to 
prepare for the games tha t boosts 
the team. He works hard day in and 
day out, so the fact that he hit three 
home runs this weekend is no sur-
prise," noted Riddle. "I have no 
doubt in my mind that Matt will 
continue to do what he did this 
weekend throughout the whole 
year based on how he approaches 
the game and how he prepares for 
the competition." 

But that kind of pressure to do 
consistently well has little effect on 
Smith. 

"There's a little pressure to con-
tinue this kind of hitting. My team-
mates make fun of me sometimes, 
calling me a power hitter," Smith 
joked. "But I just want to continue 
making solid contact with the ball." 

Smith not only performs on the 
field; he also assumes a leadershi p 
role in every siruation he encoun-
ters. 

"Every team needs a player like 
Matt. He leads by example and 
come through in the dutch," 
O'Brien remarked. 

"[Throughout the past five 
months of training), Matt has 
shown me what it takes to be suc-
cessful at the college level," said 
freshman infielder Keith 
Hernandez. "His aggressive men-
tality rubs off on the team, and his 
c1urch hits fired up the team and 
changed the momenrum in the ball 
games. His determination and lead-
ership in practice not only make

Riddle agrees. 
"When the team sees a guy 

working hard like Matt does - on 
and off the field - it pushes the 
rest of us to work hard, too. Matt 
carries his leadershi p, confidence, 
passion and integrity off the field 
with him and into the classroom 
and social siruations. He's just an 
all-around great guy, and his suc-
cess is something the rest of us can

said. 

Riding on the home-run-blast-
ing heels of Smith, the Triton base-
ball team prepares to face CCAA 
competition this week. 

"We are ready for CCAA play 
this week," O'Brien said. "We 
have all the potential to be a great 
team. We're playing well and 
haven't even reached our full 
potential." 

Smith and the Triton baseball 
team open their season at home 
Thursday at 2:30 p.m. against 
California State University Los 
Angeles. 

"The team is excited to start 
conference play. We are a much 
better defensive Unlt this year, and 
our pitching staff is exceptional," 
Smith said. "We are ready to go 
and face the competition."

Fencing no 
longer 
undefeated 
Tritons lose 
to top-ranked 
Div. I schools 
By JEFF CHUNG 
Contributi ng Writer 

.\ftcr rolling through the com-
petition during the firs t half of the 
season, the UCSD fencing team 
tinally hit a bump in the road dur-
Ing a difficult road trip last week-
end. 

The team traveled to the Air 
r orce Academy 111 Colorado 
Spnngs, Colo., to face some of the 
top teams in the nation. The teams 
the Tritons faced included 
Northwestern, otre Dame, 
Stanford, Duke and host Air Force, 
resulting in tough losses and mr-
ni shing the Tritons' pre~iously 
undefeated 7-0 record. 

"This weekend was a real chal-
lenge," said head coach Stuart 
Lee. "Four of the teams we faced 
were ranked in the top 10 nation-
ally and all compete at the 
Divi,ion I level." 

The women's team fini hed the 
weekend with a hard-earned 2-3 
record . [t hrought home victories 
against Duke 15 -12 and Stanford 
16- 11 - but fe ll to Northwestern 
8-19, I Olre Dam~ 9- 18, and Air 
Force 11 · 10. 

Nadini Pillai, currently Tanked 
first in the Intercollegiate Fencing 
Conference of Southern California 
in foil competition, did not travel 
with the team due to illness. This 
left it up to the other Tritons to 
pick up the slack. 

Leading the way was epee 
. tandout Raelyn Jacobsen, who 
dominated her competition with a 
12-3 individual record. Keeley 
Vega followed suit in the foil com-
petition with a strong 9-6 record . 
Other solid contributors included 
epee fencers Christine Megowan 
and Josephine Roberts with eight 
and six wins, respectively. 

The Triton men did not fare as 
well as their fema le counterparts, 
suffe ring losses agai nst all the 
teams they faced . Their matches 
showed the team's inability to com-
pete at the same level as schools 
that offer major fencing scholar-
ships. Other los e included mis-
matches against Duke 7-20, 
I orthwestern 4-23, Stanford 3 -24, 
and Notre Dame 2-25. 

With their next match taking 
place r eb. 9 at UC Santa Barbara, 
Lee and his tealll look to return to 
the dominant level of play they dis-
played previously this year. The 
team has become a powerhouse in 
its region with the men aiming for 
a third consecutive conference title 
and the women looking to regain 
the glory they had in 2000 with 
another championship. 

As the second half of leagtle 
competition rapidl y approaches, 

. the Tritons hope to once again 
sweep the com petition the way they 
did ea rlier this season. 

"I'm confident we'll win all of our 
remaining conference matches," Lee 
aid. "Though we had a tough week-

end, I feel mat we are on the verge of 
competing at the national level for 
the first time in sch I history."

Pitching, defense propel UCSD 
Baseball ready to begin CCAA, plays four against CSULA 
By ANU KUMAR 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's baseball 
team gai ned momentum heading 
into its first California Collegiate 
Athl etic Association conference 
game with a 3- 1 victory at Point 
Loma Nazarene University on 
Feb.5. 

A combined effort from UCSD 
starting pitcher Alexander 
Cremidan and the Triton bullpen 
all owed just one hit for the 
Crusaders, who previously scored 
five runs on nine hits aga inst 
UCSD in a game Feb. I at Triton 
Baseball Stadium. 

After the Triton win, Cremidan 
gave credit to his teammates. 

"We played good defense, and 
the pitchers hit their spots in the 
game today," he said . • 

In the first inning, shortstop 
J oe Schzefer of Point Loma 
walked. Schzefer later scored 
when the next batter, designated 
hitter Matt Mamula, doubled for 
the only Crusader hit in the con-
te t . 

The Tritons quickly came back 
to tie the game in their first at-bat 
of the second inning. Leading off 
the inning, catcher Tyler Sullivan 
hit his first home run of the season 
off Crusader starting pitcher Matt 
Woychak. 

UCS D took the lead in the 
fourth inning when Sullivan 
scored his second run of the game. 
With two outs, the Triton catcher, 
who finished 2-4 in the game, hit a 
double. He then came home after 
right fielder David Hawk singled. 

Hawk tallied his second RBI 
against the Crusaders in the sixth 
inning when he gave the Tritons a 
3- 1 lead. Hawk took a pitch from 
reliever Thomas Wold and put it 
over the fence in left-center field 
for a home run. 

After Hawk's home run, the 
Poi nt Loma bullpen settled down 
and managed to hold the Triton 
offense in check for the remain-
der of the game. In fact, the solo 
shot that cleared the fence was 
the only hit the Crusader bullpen 
allowed. 

Cremidan went four innings 
for the Tritons and reli evers 
Logan Boutilier, James Sanders 
and Robert Peelle completed the 
game. The UCSD junior starter 
struck out five, while the bullpen 
combined for six more. 

"The bullpen did a good job, 
just like they have been doing 
recently," Cremidan said. 

However, the Crusaders did 
have severa l scoring chances 
throughout the game. The Triton 
pi tchers did not keep the bases 
clear, allowing six walks to Point

Wonten's tenn~s itnproves to a perfect 3--0 
Tritons atop the CCAA, next take on Claremont College 
By COREY HOLMAN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women"s tennis 
team picked up two wins last 
week, knocking off California 
State University Los Angeles 8-1 
last Saturday before beating 
crosstown contender Alliant 
Interna tional University 9-0 
Tuesday afternoon . 

In the meeting between two 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association teams, the Tritons eas-
ily disposed of the Golden Eagles 
of Cal State Los Angeles. 

Kristina Jansen led UCSD, 
teaming with J asmin Dao to win 
their No. 3 doubles match 8-0 
ove r Michele Gee and Charys 
Scolton. Jansen then knocked off 

Gee in the o. 5 singles match 6-
0,6-0. 

Juli e Westerman also prevai led 
in her singles match without losing 
a game, defeating Scolton in the 

o. 6 match. 
Despite the outstanding Triton 

play, the story of the meet was the 
o. I si ngles match, which paired 

freshman Dao against Los 
Angeles ' Tamra Encina. Dao lost 
the first three games, making it 
apparent something was wrong. 
Dao retired after the third game, 
conceding the match to Encina . . 

Riding the wave of the victory 
over CSULA, UCSD headed 
down Miramar Road to take on 
Alliam International University. 

AIU, which finished 15th in the 
National Association of 

Intercollegiate Athletics last year, 
ran into a surging Triton squad, 
handily defeated their neighbors 
to the east. 

Four players made their 2002 
season debut for the Tritons 
against AIU, each picking up wins. 

Sophomore Stephanie 
Moriarty didn't lose a game in her 
No. 5 singles match, defeating 
Carmen Push in her debut. 
Freshman Barbie Duncan made 
her collegiate debut by beating 
Sarah Riedwig 6-1, 6- 1 in No. 6 
singles play. 

Despite the easy team win, 
UCSD did lose its first set of the 
season when the lone Triton 
senior, Lyndsey Tad lock, 
dropped the fi rst set in a 
tiebreaker to Rebecca Tornqu ist. 

Tadlock came back to win the 
second set in a tiebreaker before 
dominating tile third and decid-

. ing set, winning 6-0. 
On the doubles side, the 

Tritons 10 t only two games in 
three matches witll Fany Setiyo 
and Sarah Bahlert - both making 
their 2002 debut - defeating their 
No.3 singles opponent 8-0. 

UCSD is now 3-0 and leads the 
CCAA with a 2-0 conference 
record . Next up for the Tritons is a 
meet against Division III 
Claremont College on Feb. 9. T he 
following Wednesday, Feb. 13, the 
women's tennis team makes its 
home debut against another San 
Diego college, Point Loma 
Nazarene, at 2:30 p.m. at UCSD's 
North Courts. 

Cal Poly tourney dominated by Tritons 
Men 's tennis sweeps singles, doubles competitions in opener 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

Last weekend the men's tennis 
team showed little rust in its season 
opener at the Cal Poly Pompna 
Individual Tourney, sweeping the 
semifinals in both B competitions 
to set up all-UCSD showdowns in 
two of the four tournament fina ls. 

Playing against individuals from 
Redlands, Cal Lutheran, Cal Tech, 
Saddle back, Chapman, Azusa 
Pacific, Cal Poly Pomona and 
College of tile Desert, the Tritons 

fared impressively in the tourna-
ment, sending the majori ty of thei r 
players to the upper rounds. 

In men's singles, UCS D 's 
Bryan Swart and Sameer Chopra 
advanced through three rounds 
to the quarterfina ls for the 
Tritons, where Chopra defeated 
Cal Poly Pomona's David 
Nguyen 6-4, 6-2. However, 
Swatt wasn't able to advance and 
bowed out to Cal Poly Pomona's 
J .R. Vi ll oraman. 

UCSD's doubles teams were 
effective in the tournament as 

well , with the teams of Chopra and 
Swatt and UCSD's Jeff Wi lson 
and Dan Albrecht easily a~vancing 
through the early rounds. 
However, in the semifinals, the 
team of Ryan Terry and Andy 
Roland from Cal Poly Pomona 
defeated Wilson and Albrecht 8-4. 

In the B division of play, 
UCSD sent six players to the third 
round, and Tritons Everett 
Schroeter, Ami r Nejad and Blake 
Wilson-Hayden recorded victories 
in the quarterfinals. 

The B doubles teams of 

Wilson-H aydenlNick Morton, 
Sean N agel/Emil Novak and 
SchroeterlNejad also advanced to 
the quarterfi nals and recorded vic-
tories. 

In the final day of the three-day 
tourna ment, Chopra easily defeat-
ed Ca l Poly Pomona's J .R. 
Vi lloroman 6-4, 6-3, to advance to 
the fi nals to face Ja ime Maxwell 
from College of the Dese rt. 
Maxwell proved to be no challenge 
for Chopra, fa lling 6- 1, 6-4.
