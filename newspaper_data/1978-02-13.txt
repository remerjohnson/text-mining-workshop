by Dorothy Houston 
Oil drilling off the coast of 

San Diego is necessary and will 
be safely conducted, claimed 
an officiPj I the Department of 
the Interior here Saturday. 

"There will be careful 
decision making on our part 
and careful attention paid the 
oil industries," said Heather 
Ross, Assistant to the ecre-
tary of the Interior via a two-
way satellite link from 
Washington. 

Ross spoke to a panel of local 
arid state officials and a crowd 
of 200, largely business men, at 
a fdrum on the controversial 
possible sale of " Lease Sale 
48 ", .an area of the outer 
Continental Shelf (OCS) 
extending from Mexico to 
Santa Barbara, for oil drilling. 

The OCS drilling sites are 
three to 18 miles offshore. 

In March of next year, 
SecI:etary of the Interior Cecil 
Andrus will , after public 
hearings, decide whether or not 
to make Lease Sale 48 available 
to the oil companies. 

Andrus and Senator Alan 
Cranston (D-CA) were sche-
duled to speak at the UCSD 
Extension , city and county 
sponsored event, via satellites, 
but failed to appear. 

" Offshore oil drilling can 
help us maintain foreign policy 
independence, " Ross said . 
" We' re currently importing 50 
percent of our oil." 

Environment 
She stated that environmen-

tal factors will be taken into 
account before the decision is 
made on the oil drilling sites. 

"Air pollution caused by oil 
drilling would be less than that 
produced by tankers coming 
into San Diego," Ross said. 

"There will be a balancing of 
contribution from all areas 
with offshore oil resources, not 
just from Southem California," 
she added. 

Lou Haas, Southern Califor-
nia representative of Seaa&or 
Cran.ton, warned a,ainst 
"nmniDl a crap ,ame called 
the 'Iea.t.., system' ." 

He added that "We establish 

Point Reyes ( a national 
seashore) then move in with oil 
development - it's conflicting 
values." 

.. A real que tion is how are 
local groups to match govern-
ment and the oil industry," 
Haas said . 

One paneli t questioned the 
choice of OCS sites off of San 
Diego . " The oil extracted 
would only provide California 
with 26 days of electricity or the 
country with 36 hours," said 
Lorraine Boyce, chairperson of 
the forum and member of the 
San Diego Comprehensive 
Planning Organization. 

San Diego County Supervisor 
Roger Hedgecock expressed 
concern over air pollution 
caused by oil drilling. "179 days 
out of last year we didn't meet 
federal clean air standards," 
he said. 

Hedgecock also cited the 
possibility of accidents and 
stated that the federal govern-
ment should take responsibility 
for any that occur. " Fonns of 
liability need to be in place 
before leasing can occur," he 
said. 

The County Board of Super-
visors has consistently opposed 
OCS oil drilling off of San Diego. 

The board has passed a 
resolution urging designation 
of a 50 mile marine sanctuary 
off the coast of San Diego. 

TT CIA ad 
protest set 

A protest has been scheduled 
for tomorrow at noon at the 
Triton Times office over the 
CIA advertisementS that ran in 
the paper last week. 

The protest will be followed 
by a march to the Career 
Planning and Placement 
Center where application 
forms for the CIA are available. 

According to one of the rally

protest is beiDl sponsored by 
several individuals with no one

Bekken responds to Schmidt 
Joaalban Schmidt: 

I am napoacIiq to your lettar 0DIy because lOme atudentl may, like 
yourself, have failed to read tbe Jetter of mine, printed In the January 30 
luIIe of the TT, that aUlledly prompted your reapollle. Ordinarily I would 
Dot reply to a letter whicb eomblnea lUeb _eepIDJ ,eneraUti .. wltb 10 
little cIocumeatation or nfIectIoD of naUty. In fact, all tbree letten you 

have bad printed in the TT thIa quarter (Jan. 27, Feb. 3 and Feb. ') have 
shown a total lack of writiDllIdIl aDd rationaUty. I now UDdentand why 
UCSD aaw tbe need to eltabliah remedial wriUn. programs, and IlDeerely 
hope that you take one 8000. 

Your claim that I attempted to pnaaure the TT into prlntlDl my letter is 
ridiculous. AI an admiDlltrative arm of Chancellor McElroy aDd the 
Rellnu the TT Is not vulnerable to "prellure" from anyone ltudeDt, or 
amall ,roups of Itudenll. My assumption tbat tbey would not print my 
letter was, lUi I stated, baled upon a tradition of theirs of not priDtiDiletters 

written by me or other pro.reuives. In fact , the majority of the leUers I 
bave sent to tbe TT tbla year DOt been printed. However, I do not claim that 
" the TT baa done you (me) harm by puraulDi a policy of DOt prl.ntiq your 
(my) letten." In fact only a portioa of one para.rapb of my letter even 
meDtioned my letters, and then as an example of the TT'llUppreulon of 
opinions dlfferiDi from tbelr CbanceDorial viewpoint. 

In fact, DOwbere in your letter is the basic point of my letter even 
meDtiODed, let alone dIIc:uaed. My letter objected to the inappropriate 
headUDe pl.ced 011 Monllomery Reed'lletter printed January 20th aDd to 
the fact tbat It was edited, presumably in order to make apace for an 

important article luch at tbe ODe tbat appeand in that same Issue 011 the 
UCSD football jerseys the TT's 1M buketball aquad purchued. Altlloulh 
the TT claimed, in an editor' I note printed under my letter, that "Reed's 
Jetter was not edited" lOme of the wonlin, of Montgomery Reed's letter 
was arbitrarily ebaDied and the followinl paua ... were deleted. 

In a para,rapb eoncerniDI the 
TT's relation to the AdmJnistration 
this sentence wal deleted: "It (tbe 
TT) is in fact an obstacle, belping to 
prevent students from winniDi tbe 
kind of power Stadler claims to 
hope the AS can win from the 
Administration.' , 

The last sentence of a paragraph 
explaining to Stadler that since 
students could all vote in Student 
Cooperalive Union General 
ASlemblies it wa s logical for 
members to feel that tbey were 
"representing" themselves, wbile 
in the AS, which Stadler presents as 
" representative" and " accoun· 
table", only a few students are 
permitted to make decisions, as 
well as the lollowing para,raph, 

If you're a junior or a senior majoring in math, physics or 
engineering, the Navy has a program you should know about.

is drastically less 'accountable' 
than a general auembly where 
people can gather in lafle numbers 
to overturn a previous meeting 's

yo~ can earn as much as $650 a month right through your 
seruor year. Then after 16 weeks of Officer Candidate School, 
you'll receive an additional year of advanced technical 
education. This would cost you thousands in a civilian school 
but in the Navy, we pay you. And at the end of the year of ' 
training, you'll receive a $3,000 cash bonus.

" But , a las, the TT a nd the 
Chancellor would have us think tbe 
oppoSite is true. They have , for tbe 
moment, (and at the expense of 
several tbousand dollars of our own 
student fees) convinced quite a few 
students. They have particularly 
convinced the ones sitting (in 
"Council") on their AS." 

The TT, as the most frequently 
published campus " newspaper" , 
ha s a great deal of effect on 
students. Thus it il important tbat 
studenta keep on top of them, point 
out to otber students the fallacies 
and inaccuracies of the TT 's 
alleged " news coverage ." The 
influence the TI has on the lives of 
students is enormous, and yet the 
TT is an arm of the Administration.

Get CIA off campus 
Editor: 

The Central InteUi.ence Agency is an organization which has tradition-
ally oppoled pro.rellive movements throughout the world . The 
infHtration of the pro,re •• lve or.anizations , the overthrow of 
democratically elected .overnments, the assisination of political leaders; 
these are all documented activities en,a.ed in by the CIA . The CIA has, 
beyond doubt, enga,ed in a brutal terrorist attack upon progressive 
movements. 

There is no reason to believe that the CIA has ceased these activities. 
Despite the much ballyhooed legillation passed by Congress to piace 
restrictions upon the CIA's activities the simple fact remains that those 
activities were also iIIe,al before. Since the CIA broke all the rules with 
impunity in the past it would be irrational to expect them to suddenly

Editor: 
In response to other students' 

opinions in last Friday 's (Feb. 10, 
1978) TT about the C.I.A . advertise-
ment: 

We feel that the TT's printJng of the CIA ads condones the actIVities ofthe 
CfA . A medium accepting ad ve r tise ments also accepts certai n 
responsibilities. It is irresponsible, not to mention immoral , to print ads 
recruiting individuals to engage in terrorist activities throughout the 
world, it is irresponsible to accept advertisi ng from any source without 
considering the moral implications of that action . The TT talks of freedom 
of the press (and information) as justifications for running the CIA ad - Ka te Sullivan & Peter Tiersma 
would they then have sold Hitle r an ad to recruit members of the SS?, seem to deem the C.I.A . most of the 
would they take an ad for Krugerra nd? Or a Mafia ad? qualities of Hitler's gestapo with 

The TI cannot pretend to be isolated from world events. They have a s t atements like " Having just 
obligation to exercise social responsibility in the sale of ad space , as does dusted off most of Latin America " 
the university have the responsibility , as yet unfulfilled, to exe~cise ~ocia! and comparing the ad to equivalent 
responsibility in research . We urge all students to boycott all Triton Times advertisements by the " Mafia or 
commercial advertisers. some mercena ry group asking 

CIA out of the TT and off campus. . UCSD students to apply for career 

Needless to say the C.I .A. is not 
the holiest branch of the u .s. 
government , and r do agree with 
KateSuilivan 's complaint about the 
terms " women and minorities are 
encouraged to apply." That could 
be said a little better as "an equal 
opportunity employer." 

However , you both , Peter 
Tiersma and Kate Sullivan, seem to 
state that the advertisements are 
immoral and hence should be 
banned. That is your opinion. Whal 

is immoral and what isn' t? Is there 
a set of morals for everyont: to 
follow? Of course not! Differen t 
countries and different peoples and 
most especially differt'nt indivi-
duals have different morals or for 
that matter none at all. 

So why should the ad not be 
printed? What gives you the rightto 
tell me that I can ' t read it? It should 
be printed. Then if you still think the 
ad is objectionable you don ' t have 
to read it, but don't deny me the 
right to.

In 1~5 massive student pro~ta, large response from students GLORIA LlEBRENZ, 
coordmated through the antl-CIA requesting additional career Director, Career Planoln, ,_ 
Coalition, were held opposing the 
recruitment by the CIA of students, 
especially women and minorities, 
on campus. There is no reason to 
believe that student opil)ion has 
changed, especially in light of the 
March 1977 Referendum in which 
1.345 students voted to "disclose 
and sever all relations between the 
University and the Central 
Inteiligenre Agency and all other 
instit utions of esp ion a ge or 
docu men ted subversion of demo-
cratic rights." (890 students voted 
against this question .) 

In view of the TT's pro-adminis-
trative stance it is imperative that 
st udents maintain sources of 
information independent of their 
control. To a certain extent the 
Letters to the Editor space in the TT 
is suc h a source, although, of 
course , the policy of editing , 
distorting, mis'headlining and not 
printing many letters does make it 
less than ideal. Your unprincipled, 
and irrational letter serves no 
useful purpose in as much as all 
rational individuals will discard it 
for the illogical trash that it is.

UCSD music notes 

"Waterdrums" due for center 
The Center for Music Experi· 

ment will host visiting re-
searcher Richard Waters , 
during a residency made 
possible by a Ford Foundation 
grant. Known for his innovative 
acoustic Instruments, Mr. 
Waters will spend the majority 
of his efforts here on building a 
set of " waterdrums" for the 
Center. 

which he describes as "the 
most significant new acoustic 
musical instrument since the 
saxaphone . " 

His instruments have take.n 
him to other unusual places. He 
has recently returned from a 
trip to Magdalena Bay in Baja , 
Mexico where he joined a group 
of scientists, artists and 
musicians participating in a 
docmentary filming of whales. 
One of the things they studied 
was the interspecies commun-
ication between man and 
cetacean utilizing his "water-
phones ." He played the 
instrument on a tiny raft for 
thousands of whales and 
porposies who gathered to 
respond with sounds the 
scientists know as sonar 
checks. 

Founder of the "Gravity 
Adjusters Expansion Band" in 
1967, he directs this multi-
media music ensemble into 
new modes of artistic expres-

Waters, originally an artist 
making moveable sculpture, 
became interested in the sound 
qualities of the materials he 
was using. Experimentation 
and study into acoustical 
physics has provided the basis 
for his work ever since. He has 
developed such unusual 
instruments as a playable 
aeolian harp; a micro-tonal 
revolving sound generator 
(which the UCSD Music 
Department purchased last 
year); a My tar (his version of a 
sitar) ; Corrugahorns (multi· 
octave, corrugated pipes) and 
his patented .. waterphone" . sion. Utilizing exprimental and

THE NOBLE MAN 
It was late at night. He had waited until this late hour so 

thers would not know that he was seeking ... seeking 
orne thing more. He was an older man, a ruler among his 

ople, well-respected, a religious leader, a scholar. He 
ad made it to the place where others longed to be. 
But now he was here, face to face with a man who was' 
rhaps half his age, a man with no formal education, a 
an from a despised country. 
Having heard of this young man's wisdom he came 

oping to acquire one more teaching. His need, he 
hought, was a higher education. But the young man 
hought otherwise. He told him of another life, a higher 
ife, a life he had never known from his physical birth. He 
old him of his need to be born again. - Sowen 

non-conventional instruments, 
the performances are blends of 
new music , Cine arts, crafts, 
poetry and motion . 

He has shown in many 
galleries , performed his 
instruments for film and T .V, 
scores (including 2001: A Space 
Odyssey), and has his own 
compa ny , .. Multi-Media" , 
where he designs and mark ts 
his experimental instruments 
and sound devices . 

A Colloquium will be held on 
February 22 at noon in Building 
408 on the Warren Campus. Mr. 
Waters will talk about his 
sculptures and show slides. 
This event is free of charge and 
is open to the public . For 
further information call 452-

Hyman's Plan ... 
(Continued from page 1) 

There are, however. at least 
two theories that have gained 
some acceptance among AS 
members . 

According to several inde· 
pendent sources Hyman is the 
victim of a smear campaign. 
These sources say that as a 
potential presidential candi· 
date in the upcomng spring 
elections. several parties would 
stand to gain by a discredited 
Hyman.

Today, student attitudes are 
more moderate with freshmen 

concerned and interested in 
collele activites. 

Or, at least this is the feelinl 
of the four UCSD college deana 
as expressed in recent inter-
views. 

"I rirst noticed the chaDie in 
student attitudes duriDJ{ the fall

invite all of our new students to 
join in a variety of activities. 
They showed up in far greater 
numbers than we would 
normally expect," said Muir

format was similar ,to-the past. 
Third College Dean Heverly 

Varia observes the largest 
change in the increasinl 
number of .tudenta who are 
volunteeriq for committees. 
The .tudents would like to see 
more extra-curricular activi-
ties, according to Varaa . "The 
students get so involved that 
they sometimes forget that 
they are here to study," said 
Varga. 

More involved 

Students are more involved 
because they ha ve more 
options, said Warren Colege 
Dean Gary Frot. He explained 
that presently it is acceptable 
for students to be involved, 
whereas a few years back, the 
students were part of a " non-joining" culture. There is a 
much more tolerant attitude of 
students toward other students, 
said Frost. They can be 
involved in social work or 
volunteer work without being 
criticized for it, he added. 

Revelle College Dean Ernest 
Mort sees the freshmen as very 
consumer-conscious . He 
explained that more freshmen 
are working or taking out loans. 
More students are responsible 
for their own finances , and as a 
result, more students are very 
concerned about how their 
money is being spent, said 
Mort. It used to be only juniors 
and seniors who were con-
cerned about finances , he 
added. 

The attitude of students 
reflect what is going on 

• ..,. FeINuery 13. 1171 

socially, politically and 
economically in a country at a 
particular time, laid Frost. 
"The freshmen are unaware 
that we are in a time of 
increased inflation and 
unemployment, and as a result, 
are more career-oriented." 

The freshmen are more self 
reliant, because they have had 
to work and have had to take 
responsibility on earlier, said 
Varga. 

There has been a decrease in 
vandalism and thefts in the 
dorms this year, according to 
Beckley. " I believe ifsbecause 
they're taking more of an 
initiative to check suspicious 
people. We 've gotten a lot more 
calls saying that there is a 
suspicious person up in our 
area and could we please check 
it out, " said Beckley. Varga 
added that the Third College 
dorms have always had low 
vandalism and theft rates . 

Still studying 
The studying has remained 

constant, but the students are 
much more relaxed than they 
used to be, said Mort. 

Because of its lesser penal-
ties, marijuana is still being 
used, but there is far les usage 
of hallucinogens, according to 
Beckley. 

"The drug issue has gotten 
pushed onto high school. The 
students don't have to wait until 
they get away from home and in 
college to deal with this issue. 
They are arriving more mature 
in terms of coping with life and 
managing their lives," said 
Beckley.

USD acting as if they were

THE IMMORAL WOMAN 

It was high noon. The other women were inside now, 
sheltered from the blazing heat. Now was her chance to 
draw water from the public well, while no one was 
around to remind her of her past. 

Her drawing water in the heat of the day was just a 
picture of her inner drive for satisfaction. She had been 
through five husbands already and one by ODe she had 
exhausted their ability to quench her continual thirst. 
After the fifth , she had given up. She had just moved in 
with another, not bothering with the formality of 
marriage. The whole town knew about it. 

As she approached the well, she saw a stranger, sitting, 
obviously weary from a long journey. As she drew near 
he asked her for a drink. 

In the moments that followed, she found herself 
opening to this stranger all her inner longings for 
satisfaction. He never rebuked her. He simply presented 
to her an alternative - a hving water, a water that inside 
her would become a fountain welling up into etemallife. 
She would never thirst again. - Sowen

University committee recommendation 

UC should ·keep nuke ties- panel 
A stateWide U(; committee 

has recommended that the 
university maintain its 
relationship with governmen-
tal nuclear laboratories located 
in Livermore, CA, and Los 
~lamos, N.M. 

The LaboratOries, where the 
first atomic bombs were 
developed, are administered by 
the university, with the 
government picking up the 
annual operating tab of $500 

Insurance careers 
aren't 
wllat 
they 
used 
to be. 

Remember the old stereotype? The flashy 
smile, quick handshake, fast talk and" . .. sign 
on the dotted line." That marketing app"roach is as 
passe as high button shoes. Today the burgeoning 
markets of personal and business insurance demand the 
very best in conscientious counselling to secure their clie 
financial futures. 

That's where we come in. Metropolitan. We're the second 
largest insurer in the world . Through our group, personal and business 
coverages we insure one out of five people throughout the U.S. and Canada.

The eight-member special 

review committee was named 
by UC President David Saxon 
after a series of protests last 
year against university 
involvement with the labs.

plishment was Albert Williams' 
first place in the 500 free with a

That's where you come in . I f you'll be graduating soon in business management, marketing, public 
relations or a related field and you've never thought about a career in insurance, think again . 

If you qualify for a position with us, you'll receive the very best professional instruction and back· 
up assistance, plus a generous compensation and benefits package. And you'll have the satisfaction of 
helping secure the futures of families and businesses while securing your own .

At UCSD, the largest organ-
ized protest took the form of a 
one-day "No-NUkes Teach-in" 
last quarter. At the teach-in, 
speakers said all American 
nuclear weapons are produced 
by the two labs operated by UC. 

After meeting Riverside the 
two teams travelled to Pomona 
where they encountered 
freezing temperatures and 
heavy winds. Despite these 
obstacles, the women won 79-
69, but the men lost by a score of 
52~9. Both coaches described 
the meet as "mediocre." 

Individual record break.ers 
included Joanna Losito who 
grabbed a first place for the 
women with her time of 27.4 in 
the 50 free. Bunny Stein swam 
the 100 butterfly for the first 
time during a meet and ea.rned 
a respectful third place with a 
1: 18.9. Ceci Smith claimed 
second in the event with 1: 12.4. 
In the 200 free Susan Zneimer 
took third with 2: 27.8.

not quite straiaht, they decided 
to get him for it." 

Nearly all AS officials 
interviewed by the Triton 
Times for this story agree that 
the circumstances surrounding 
the Hyman case are a result of 

an AS which lacks goals and 
leadership. These officials say 
that the AS wlll not stop this sort 
~f fighting until a.n AS with a 
better sense of purpose is 
elected , 

o Whether the Hyman case is 
only a result of the conditions 
prevailing in the old AS, or the 
first shot in an election 
campaign, is still unknown.
