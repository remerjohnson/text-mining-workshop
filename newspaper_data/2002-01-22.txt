By KECIA R. FEIJON 
Staff Writer 

More than 300 UCSD faculty, 
staff and students marched Jan. 19 in 
the 22nd annual King Day Parade to 
honor Dr. Martin Luther King,Jr. 

The parade, which included 
thousands of San Diegans from a 
variety of schools, churches and 
community groups, as well as indi-
viduals, gathered along San Diegos 
Embarcadero and traveled along 

Harbor Drive to honor the slain civil 
rights leader. 

Ths year marked the 15th year 
in which UCSD has participated in 
the parade, and all five colleges, the 
Preuss School and UCSD 
Healthcare staff showed their sup-
port. 

"I think it is important to show 
the community a united front with 
total participation from staff, faculty 

. and students," said Ann Brady, cam-
puswide event coordinator. 

The crowd was a sea of diverse 
faces and ages as the parade made its 
way down Harbor Drive.

UCSD organization joins in 
weekend protest of Borders 
Campus chapter ofLGBTA was among several who 
were unhappy with Dr. Laura Schlessinger's presence 
By KIRSTEN HUBBARD 
Staff Writer 

Members of the UCSD les-
bian, gay, bisexual, and transgen-
der community participated in a 
protest against Borders book-
store's decision to hold a book 
signing for outspoken radio per-
sonality Dr. Laura Schlessinger 
o n Sun day. 

Schl essi nger, o r "Dr. Laura" 
as she is known to her listeners, 
was a t the Missio n Va ll ey 
Borders promoting her newest 
book, Ten Stupid Things Couples 
Do to Mess Up Their Relationships. 

"Dr. Laura is a joke," ~ a id 
E leanor Roosevel t senior and 
demonstrator Tara Barnes. 
"What she proves to have exper-
tise on is not her fi eld. She spews 

endle s fallacies ... he is hateful 
and ridiculous." 

chlessinger, a popular radio 
personality, provides millions of 
listeners with relationship advice. 
She h::.s often been criticized for 
remarks seen by some as dis-
paraging toward homosexuals. 

lission Valley Border gen-
eral manager Gail Knippelmeyer 
feels very strongl} about its cus-
tomers' right to make their own 
decisions. 

"Our customers are diverse 
and intell igen t," said 
Knippelmeyer, "W e at Borders 
have a commitment to a depth o f 
selection . We offer over 200,000 
titles and host hundreds of events 
each year. N aturally some will be 
considered controversial o r 
objectiona ble depending on the 

Dancing for 
awareness 

viewpoint of each customcr." 
The protesters (listnbutcd 

colorful leaflets with information 
about Schles~lnger and thclr 
demonstration ro p,lsscrsby and 
bookstore patrons. 

The Icaflct~ contained quota-
tions by SchlesslOger that they 
feel are h.1teful toward the gay 
and Ie bian commul1lty. 

One such quote, from 
December 1998, said, "I'm sorry, 
hear it one more time perfectiy 
clearly: If you're gay or a lesbian, 
it's a biological error that inhibits 
you from re lating normally to 
the opposite sex." 

T h ey also provided quotes 
from M arti n Luther King, Jr. 
condem ning hatred.

Protest: 
Demonstration was against 
Borders, not Schlessinger 
Continued from page 1 

"I just can't believe an educated 
person would spread the type of 
hat~ she does," said Devon Gessert, 
a Muir senior. "I think it's sad." 

OrganiLing the demonstration 
was Sherry Wright, the director of 
public policy at the San Diego 
Le~bian antI Gay Men's Center. 

The center sent an e-mail about 
the demonstration to all the related 
organizations, including UCSD's 
Lcsbi.m, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender 
Associa tIOn. 

"\Ve're not here to protest Dr. 
Lallra," \\'right sa id. "We're here to 
proles t Bord-ers in their partnership 
\\ ith hatc. I Borucrs'l sponsorship 
rcl:He to college students becallse it 
sends them a message that [intoler-
,Incel IS O.K. This is important for 
~ rudents to know what's really out 
there. Snldems looking into social 
Justice, or other kinds of movement 
work, anyone really ... they have to 
realize we've still got a long way to 
go." 

Around 100 demonstrators 
,Issembled in front of Borders, 
adorned with tiny rainbow sockers 
;\I1d armed with signs boasong mes-
sages such as, "Pro-Family, Pro-
America, Anti-Hate" and, "Hate is a 
four-Iettcr word." 

"Therc's lots of energy behind 
It," Wright said of the demonstra-
tion. 

In addition to the- anti-
Schlessinger protest there was a 
smaller counterdemonstration in 
support of her. 

Supporters of Schlessinger had 
signs of their own, proclaiming 
"Love is a four-letter word too" and 
"Homosexualiry is not in the 
Constitution. " 

Many of Schlessinger's support-
ers maintained rel igious viewpoints, 
idemifying themselves as born-
again Christians or Jews who felt 
Schlessinger defended family values. 

Schlessinger has had an on-air 
radio career for over 25 years, cur-
rently boasting 400 radio stations 
and 15 million listeners. 

However, UCSD students were 
not among the Dr. Laura support-
ers. 

"We don't want Borders to sup-
port those who support hate," said 
Joe Adams, a Warren senior stand-
ing near the front of the assembly. 
"We are hoping to change Borders' 
policy." 

Adams, along with other protest-
ers, was surprised by Borders' deci-
sion to invite Schlessinger, saying 
Borders is a "company that is typi-
cally a friend to the gay communiry, 
serving gay consumers and hiring 
gay employees." 

"I support Dr. Laura's righ t to 
write what she wants," said Liberry 
Smith, a Ph.D. candidate of litera-
ture. "I do not support a store 
claiming to be a friend to the gay 
and lesbian communi ry inviting 
someone like her for a book sign-
ing." 

Lindsey Burcham, a Muir 
College senior, held a handwri tten 
sign that read, "Hate is not 
American." 

"Dr. Laura spreads a message of 
hatred and oppression ," Burcham 
said. 

"Dr. Laura preaches against real -
ly good people just because they are 
different than her." 

Schlessinger was unavailable for 
questioning because onl y those 
arriving specifically for the book 
signing were able to enter the book-
store. 

Kory Schaff, a Ph.D student and 
Mui r College instructor, demon-
strated for over an hour. 

"I'm here to protest Borders' 
suppOrt of people who are intolerant 
toward sexual minorities," he said. 

"Intolerance," said Schaff, "is a 
bad thing."

UC Regents will try to 
increase graduate 
enrollment at campuses 
Commission report to regents declares 
need for 50 percent increase in funding 
By LARA MoseRIP 
Senior Staff Vllriter 

Graduate student enrollment 
across the UC system must increase 
by 50 percent in the next eight years, 
according to a UC task force. 

The Commission on Growth 
and Support of Graduate Education 
was formed by the UC Board of 
Regents last year to study why grad-
uate enrollment has declined in 
California over the past decade. 

In a written statement, UC 
President Richard C. Atkinson cited 
the state's need for innovaoon in a 
"knowledge-based economy," espe-
cially in the fields of biotechnology 
and electronics, as a reason to create 
new avenues of providing financial 
support to graduate students. 

In order to create this "well-edu-
cated" work force, the Universiry of 
California plans to spend $215 mil-
lion annually on graduate education. 

In addition to Atkinson's belief 
that the UC system must educate the 
students needed to "create new 
industries not yet imagined," he 
acknowledges that increased gradu-
ate enrollment will also create a need 
for new faculty members to teach 
the 60,000 new undergraduate stu-
dents expected to enroll within the 
next 10 years. 

The universiry estimates that 
California's new undergraduate stu-
dents will need about 40,000 new 
faculty l11embers to meet its educa-
tional needs. The commission rec-

onunended that the University of 
California ask for state-funded post-
secondary teaching fellowships for 
UC graduate students who agree to 
teach at California universities. 

UCSD Dean of Graduate 
Srudies Richard Attiyeh said the UC 
graduate snldent enrollment figures 
need to catch up with the level of 
undergraduate admission growth 
and that new forms of graduate stu-
dent support will facilitate this 
process. 

The dispariry between under-
graduate and graduate enrollment is 
due in part to "the state, which was 
unwilling or unable to fund the 
instructional resources for graduate 
growth," Attiyeh said. 

Attiyeh says that "to catch up to 
where grad enrollment ought to be," 
the universiry needs to find money 
to provide competitive fellowships 
to the growing number of graduate 
students. 

The Universiry of California 
plans to entice the most talented 
graduate students to enroll at UC 
schools with teaching fellowships, 
increased federal support for fellow-
ship stipends, and 1,000 new "incen-
tive grants," which will be avai lable 
to srudents awarded prestigious 
national fellowships. 

Admission standards for gradu-
ate students should not be compro-
mised to allow for the growth the 
uni versiry desires, Chair of the

Union, all but three currencies, the 
histories of which in many cases go 
back hundreds of years, are being 
replaced by a new currency: the 
euro. 

The old currencies will not dis-
appear at once. In France, for 
instance, it will be possible to use 
francs until Feb. 17. In italy, the 
lira will circulate until Feb. 28. 
Germany, unique among the 
European countries, decided to go 
cold turkey; on J an. I, the German 
mark disappeared forever. 

The birth of the new currency 
marked the tone of this New Year's 
Eve. Almost all the huge, public 
square parties that were organized 
by both large and small European 
municipalities to welcome the new 
year had the euro as a central 
theme. 

The new currency was publicly 
inaugurated by the president of the 
European Commission, Romano 
Prodi, who bought - with euros, 
of course - a bouquet of roses for 
his wife at 12:01 a.m. Throughout 
the night, curious Europeans 
crowded ATMs to have a first look 
at the new notes. 

The euro will become so much a 
part of Europeans' daily lives that 
people will have trouble remem-
bering the pre-eum days. But from 
the point of view of relatively 
detached observers who will proba-
bly use the curo only while on vaca-
tion, what considerations can we 
make about it? 

First, the euro's introduction 
indicates a remarkable capacity to 
promote and accept social and cul-
tural change. I doubt America 
could implement a similar measure 
now. Imagine the likelihood of the 
United States eliminating the dol-
lar to share a currency with Canada 
and Mexico and you will have an 
idea of what I mean. 

The euros birth opposes the 
many euro-skeptic signs that have 
been produced recently. The 
prospect of a unified Europe is still 
far away, and the division over 
recent issues of international poli-
tics shows that as a political entity, 
Europe is sti ll . "a geographic 
expression." The impression, how-
ever, is that after 2,000 years of 
warfare, Europeans have under-
stood that they cannot progress 
without one another. 

The second consideration 
arises from a slight twiSt in the 
observation just n~ade -

there are few 
signs of polit-

ical union, but the economic union 
has been arguably accomplished. 

It is hard not to see a confirma-
tion of the primacy of economy 
over politics today, an indication of 
the incipient crisis of politics. 
Financial scandals and financial 
concentrations - the Enron bank-
ruptcy being the most recent -
have dramatically revealed this 
problem in America: The economy 
has become more and more inde-
pendent of political and democratic 
control. It is now a force with its 
own objectives, its own institutions 
and considerable independence. 

The ease with which the euro 
has been introduced amid great 
political and social differences is 
another sign that business prevails 
over politics in Europe, too. 

Even in Europe, we can expect 
the political agenda to be increas-
ingly dictated by economic inter-
ests. This matter is not trivial. 
Centuries of struggle have given us 
the legal instruments to monitor 
and control the political power, but 
the global reach of econOlnic inter-
ests is so recent that, to this day, the 
collectivity is defenseless against 
them. 

For example, I can fearlessly say 
terrible things about the U.S. pres-
ident because the First Amendment 
protects me. However, if I publicly 
cri ticize specific products and 
invite people not to consume them, 
I risk multiple lawsuits. 

The European "third way" was 
origi nally meant as a conciliation of 
the needs of capitalism and the pri-
macy of politics, intended as man-
agement of the common guod. The 
speed differential between the eco-
nomic and the political integration 
of Europe makes one wonder if the 
overbearing power of economy that 
we are witnessing here is extending 
faster than we thought. 

My third and final consideration 
is strictly personal. With the intro-
duction of the euro, certain curren-
cies will disappear that had a special 
significance for me. 

WIllie [ understand the impor-
tance of the uni fied currency and 
see its inevitability, I will miss the 
colorful beauty of the Dutch 
guilder, with notes that look like 
abstract paintings, and the crisp 
and crackling paper of the French 
franc. 

Most of all, I will miss the 50-
franc note. While other countries 
were busy celebrating dead presi-
dents and mem bers of the royal 
family, the French decided to put 
the Little Prince on the 50-franc 
note, the characler of the epony-
mous children's book written by 
Antoine de Saint-Exupcry. I can 
think of no better homage to the 

French than this little boy

TUESDAY, JANUARY 22, 2002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Do not give terrorists death 
speak up, 
speak qut 

Dear Attorney General 
Ashcroft: 

While the world anxiously 
awaits your decision on the fate 
of Zacarias Moussaoui, Lotfi 
Raissi and the hundreds of sus-
pected Al-Qaeda detainees, I 
respectfully offer this one piece 
of advice: Don't ta ke the easy 
way out and give them the death 
penalty. 

I do not base my advice on 
any of the traditional arguments . 
You are most likely fed up with 
hearing those from the leaders of 
the European Union or those 
fervently against it in the United 
States, who say that the death 
penalty is antiquated, barbaric 
and inhumane. 

I believe the death penalty is 
too good and too easy a punish-
ment for those terrorists. 

If the suspects are found 
guilty of their numerous terrorist 
and conspi racy charges, they do 
not deserve the gift of death. In 
fact, Mr. Ashcroft, if you decide 
to give them the death penalty, 
you will betray every victim of 
the ept. II attacks. 

Those terrorists were sent on 
a jihad, a holy war, on a mission 
of martyrdom. 

Osama bin Laden addressed 
this mission of martyrdom, as 
evidenced from the transcript of 
the tape printed Dec. 13,2001 in 
The Washington POri. 

In it, bin Laden was quoted as 
saying, "The brothers who con-

ducted the operation, all they 
knew was that they have a mar-
tyrdom operation, and we asked 
each of them to go to America, 
but they didn't know anything 
about the operation, not even 
one letter. " 

It is clear from the words of 
bin Laden that he sent willing 
followers to the United States to 
fight a jihad, which they knew 
1V0uld end their own lives. The 
19 terrorists on the planes ful-
filled their "martyrdom opera-
tion," sealing it with not only the 
deaths of thousands of innocent 
people, but also with their own. 

But if Moussaoui, Raissi and 
the hundreds of other suspected 
Al-Qaeda detainees are found 
guilty, they must remain alive. 
We should not grant them the 
means to complete their mission, 
which is achieved through death . 

Every minute of every day 
that the terrori sts remain alive 
will serve as the perfect justice, 
for breathing the air of the hated 
United States will serve as a con-
stant reminder that they were 
captured before they could com-
plete their operation of martyr-
dom. The only true, harsh, just 
punishment is to give them a 
sentence of bitter life, knowing 
they have failed in their beloved 
jihad. It would be the perfect 
justice. 

For this reason, the dt:1th 
penalty is completely out of the 
question. Only through life will 
the terrorists truly suffer. It is 
incumbent upon you, Mr. 
Ashcroft, to now fashion the per-
fect punishment for those "evil-
doers." 

If it is your wish to punish 
those found gui lty with the same 
measure of suffering that they 
inflicted, then I propose two sepa-

rate plans, depending on what 
outcome you desire. 

The convicted terrorists could 
be sentenced to help with the 
cleanup of {he World Trade 
Center, thus helping to rebuild 
the very symbol of America they 
tried to destroy. The convicted 
could then clean the new build-
ing every day until they die. 
There could be no worse punish-
ment for them, because they will 
wish to be dead. 

However, if you prefer a more 
traditional approach, please take 
a look at my other plan. 

Under this · plan, those found 
guilty will be transferred to serve 
out the rest of their lives in the 
worst prisons of New York. Of 
course, these transfers need not 
be done secretly; in fact, I think 
that some publicity would be 
helpful. 

In the hierarchy of prison life, 
child molesters are the most 
despised prisoners and mo t tor-
mented by other inmates. But 
that will change, I believe, with 
the transfer of these terrorists to 
New York prisons, where feelings 
of anger and grief have left no 
New Yorker untouched. There 
could not be a better way for 
these terrorists to be punished, 
except to be terrorized daily by 
the very people they sought to 
terrify and kill . 

1 recommend that no terrorist 
that is or will be tried in connec-
tion to the Sept. 11 attacks be 
granted the option of the death 
penalty. 

Death is too good for them. 
Death will vault those terrorists 
to the coveted plateau of martyr-
dom. The worst punishment of 
all will be the sentence of life. 

Respectfully yours, 
Parisa Baparian

u.s. assistance to the 
Philippines is fair 
military intervention 
Island nation contends with 
terrorists, needs training aid 
By SUSAN FORE 
Contributing Writer 

The United States is sending 
troops to the Phili ppines for war 
games, where they will apparently 
practice on live targets: the Abu 
Sayyaf, which is a Muslim group 
claiming to fight for an indepen-
dent Muslim state on the island of 
Basilan in the southern Philippines. 

Abu Sayyaf has been named a 
terrorist threat by the current pres-
ident of the Philippines, Gloria 
Macapagal Arroyo. The United 
States will deploy about 650 troops 
to "practice" army tactics against 
the Muslim militants, who have 
demonstrated their loathing for 
human life most recently by kidnap-
ping about 70 people since May. 

American tourist Guillermo 
Sobero was among those allegedly 
beheaded by Abu Sayyaf in the past 
months. Two Anlerican Christians 
and a Filipino nurse are sti ll being 
held on Basilan. Recently released 
hostages are reported to have seen 
the couple and described them as 
"not just skinny, but bony." 

This is not a matter of terror-
ism, but of humanity. 

However gruescme the past has 
been, the future is sure to reveal 
several more doses of reality. 
American troops are the best in the 
world, and to help control the 
inhumane acrs performed by the 
Abu Sayyaf, it is sensible for the 
Philippines to ask for help from the 

strongest. 
The history of the Abu Sayyaf 

includes the decapitation of several 
of its hostages and the kidnapping 
of children, a grandmother and 
many foreigners. A raid on a 
Christian village in 1995 killed 53 
inhabitants and soldiers. Extortion, 
piracy, robbery and ransom kidnap-
pings provide money for the band, 
but it is believ~d that support also 
comes from Osama bin Laden's ter-
rorist network. 

However, if one knows the his-
tory of American troops in th e 
Philippines, there is no denying the 
complications between the two 
nations. The mid-1980s brought 
the "peaceful" overthrow of 
President Ferdinand Marcos, and 
Arroyo now faces possible 
impeachment for cooperating with 
the United States in its efforts to 
fight terrorist activity on the 
islands. 

According to the constitution of 
the Phili ppincs, foreign troops are 
prohibited from participating in 
combat missions on Philippine soil. 
U.S. troops left in 1992 after 
Mount Pinatubo erupted and 
deStroyed an American base. The 
Philippine Senate refused to renew 
the lease for a second base. Many 
Filipinos would be happy if the 
U.S. presence never returned . 
However, that would be an incon-
sistent move in American policy.

Philippines: 
u.s. shows commitment 
to morality through help 
Continued from page 5 

When militants first took 
Amencan hoslages, the United 
States refused to pay a ransom, and 
that IS the source of conflict. It is 
not alwa~'s possible to pay each 
group of tcrronsts for the safety of 
citizens, hut II hen the group is then 
IlIIkcd to .\J -Q.lcd:l and Tillib,m 
forces, the story changes. It is noble 
fo r troops to help a struggling 
country when their president 
requests it, ano we do not seem to 
be helping out of outright greed, 
but one has to wonder. 

PresideJ1l George W. Bush 
seems to know exactly what is pro-
hi hited in the restrictive constitu-
tion, and he agrees to stay out of 
comba t, per se. Nevertheless, the 
trOOps will assist in training the 
Philippine forces and will accompa-
ny the forces on patrol through 
rebel terri tory. They will be armed 
and prepared for any defense. This 
si tuation makes it easy to blame the 
rebels for starting any attack. 

Questioning the morality of the 
United States is not a new thing for 
people of all nationalities to do. Even 
Americans do it. Even so, one cannot 
help thinking of aJl those brutaUy 
killed by lhese freedom fighters 
ca lled the "Bearers of the Sword," 
and this recent step to halt such cru-
elties should be commended. 

As questionable as the tactics of 
our troops may appear, Abu Sayyaf 
ca nnot go unpunjshed for the 
atrocities it has committed against 
innocent people. 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN TUESDAY, JANUARY 22. ZOOZ 

Bible never receives serious discourse 
Academics at UCSD do not allow for theological discussions 
By MATTHEW E. CROW 
Staff Writer 

o book has influenced tlle 
cour e of history morc than what 
has come to be known as the Bible, 
the collection of stories that te lls 
of the rise of tlle people of Israel, 
their oppression under various 
empires and the later journeys of 
the original fo llowers of J esus 
across the Middle East. 

However, more important than 
the scientific and historical quality 
of the Bible is what it reveals about 
God to the people who read it. 
The intent of the Bible is to teach 
the descendants of Abraham and 
the followers of Christ about their 
collective relationship, or 
covenant, with God. It is true that 
many varieties of this relationship 
exist within the Jewish and 
Christian worlds; by and large, the 
purpose of the Bible is to teach us 
about how God wants us to live. 

U nfortunatel y, this creates 
problems for srudents at a public 
coll ege who wish to or are 
required to study this book. One 
cannot effectively read a book 
about God where it is discouragd 
to ta lk about him in the theologi-
cal sense. We have to find a bal-
ance between two extremes. The 
question is whether we can find a 
balance between the two at this 
university. 

To explore such a question we 
must, as our professors would say, 

go to the text. Let US take the story 
of Adam and Eve, and let US assume 
that the story is not to be taken lit-
erally. The authors of this story 
were trying to convey what they 
understood about God and the 
imperfections of the world to their 
readership, the people of Israel. 

In the Story, God creates every-
thing in perfect ha rmony, with the 
exception of the Tree of the 
Knowledge of Good and Evil. 

The frui t of this tree contains 
the ability to know what God 
knows: that there is evi l in the 
world and it is readily attainable by 
mankind. At first, humans do not 
know this, but they know that they 
have been told not to eat the fruit. 
They eat it anyway. 

Now this is where interpreting 
and anaJyzing the story gets inter-
esting. Why wowd God put the 
tree there, have it grow fruit, but 
not expect anyone to touch it? That 
doesn't make sense. In the begin-
ning, Adam and Eve lived in a state 
of "ignorance is bliss," prancing 
naked through the garden without a 
care in the world. After they con-
sume the fruit, Adam and Eve gain 
the knowledge of good and evil, and 
accordingly, the power to choose 
between the two. This may sound 
tragically ironic, but they don't 
know that the serpent's temptation 
to eat the fruit is evil until after they 
have eaten the fruitl While this 
makes their relationship to God 
more distant, it aJso makes it. more 

meaningful. Instead of being forced 
to live under God, mankind must 
choose to have faith in God. 

Thus, the relationship between 
man and God is enriched. Loving 
God becomes a challenge for peo-
ple to accept and attempt, not sim-
ply a !,";ven. Maybe God wanted 
Adam and Eve to gain the knowl -
edge of good and evil so that faith 
would be a djfficult choice and not 
a simple order from a superior. 
Maybe God wanted everything to 
be perfect and then to have 
mankind come full circle, challeng-
ing itself to choose good instead of 
to live blindly in forced good. 

While such an idea may be 
interesting to think about and 
valuable to a person who wants to 
believe in God, it will never be 
seriously discussed in a lower-cIivi-
sion classroom here at UCSD. 

Why? Because in asking such 
questions about the Bible, we have 
crossed from the boundaries of lit-
erature and entered the endless 
expanse known as theology, a dis-
ci pline strictly prohibited in the 
confines of religious discussion in 
the classroom. 

At most schools, students have 
the option to major in theology. 
Here, there is a small but noble 
department called the Program for 
the Study of Religion, which offers 
a survey of fai th systems from 
around the world. 

That isn't bad - in fact, it is a 
wonderful thing to study - but the 

lack of true theological discussion 
in lower division or general classes 
on campus is quite apparent. 

There will never be any law or 
item of public policy that will be 
able to define exactly what should 
or should not be discussed. Rather, 
to deepen our own education and 
add to our understanding of the 
sacred texts we read, we will need 
to open our minds beyond what 
we may presently think possible. 

We must learn to treat the 
Bible and its counterparts in other 
religions for what they are: tools 
for understanding ourselves and 
our relationship with God. Not 
every student has to be a person of 
fairq; all that is necessary is people 
who are willing to examine a 
sacred text for what it is trying to 
say. Surely, continuing on our pre-
sent course of education is equal to 
cheating ourselves Out of the true 
meaning of the books we read. 

Could we discuss Homer's 
epics without discussing the roles 
of the gods and their relationship 
to men? Certainly not. 

Similarly, we cannot read the 
Bible without seriously discussing 
God. As it stands, effective educa-
tion about the Bible is impossible. 
Unless we can change how we 
read the book in class, we are 
basically wasting our time. Quite 
frankly, having the chance to 
study the Bible openly with my 
professors is something I wish I 
had.

Kenneth Burch said. 

"We are not talking about 
changing admissions," Burch said. 
"We're talking about a trend since 
the mid-1980s where students 
wowd choose another university 
over the University of California, 
not because they were not admit-
ted here, but because they did not 
receive a competitive package 
from the University of 
California." 

A better financial aid offer 
from other schools is a reason 
prospective graduate students 
choose another school over a UC 
school, Burch said. 

"Having recently gone through 
the process [of graduate school), I 
can tell you the size of the [finan-
cial] offer weighs heavily on one's 
mind when choosing whether or 
not to attend," Burch said. 

At UCSD, Attiyeh expects 
increases in graduate enrollment 
to occur in all disciplines and to 
concentrate in a few areas. 

"For UCSD, there will be 
growth across the board, but with 
somewhat more rapid growth in 
emerging disciplines - for exam-
ple, bioinformations, engineering

and management," Attiyeh said. 
"I believe planned growth can 
accommodate the growth aspira-
tions of departments in the 
humanities, the arts,. the social 
sciences and the natural sci-
ences." 

Although many departments 
will be expanded and new depart-
ments will be created, some 
departments will enjoy greater 
financial support than others, 
according to Burch. 

The disparity in funding 
among departments is addressed 
by the commission, and Burton 
acknowledges that the gap will 
have to be further studied to bring 
in more funding for the social sci-
ences and the humanities.

Parade:

Continued from page 1 
Justice marched alongside Girl 
Scout trOOps. Drill teams, law 
enforcement groups, clowns and 
marching bands - including 
UCSD's pep band - took part in 
the festivities. 

The event also drew representa-
tion from San Diego State 
University and Mesa College. 

The streets were lined not only 
with marchers, but also with specta-
tors who came to watch the colorful 
floats stream by. Onlookers set up 
folding chairs and watched the 
parade pass by. 

"I think that it is important to

son," said Naney Snyder, who held 
her I-year-old son, Dillion. 

Roger Brown, director of music

Dynes was among the UCSD 
entourage and expressed a desire to 
carry on Kings work. 

"We have not yet accomplished 
[King's] goal," Dynes said . "It's 
important to support and celebrate 
this holiday and the principles Dr. 
King believed in." 

Dynes cited the creation of dif-
ferent admission criteria, scholar-
ships to promote diversity, and the 
UCSD Diversity Council as pro-
grams working to promote a more 
diverse student body. 

Dynes acknowledged the low 
. numbers of underrepresented 
groups on UCSD's campus but said, 
"We're working on it." 

In addition to the participants 
who carried signs reading, "Civil 
Rights is Human Rights," some 
attendees took a more festive 
approach to the parade. 

"I thought it would be fun to 
co~e and see a really big parade," 
said Amr Ghanem, a Revelle fresh-
man. "I've never actually seen one." 

UCSD students filled three 
school buses in numbers greater 
than organizers had originally antic-
ipated. 

"I think it's great that all the buses 
were filled," Brady said. "We were 
hoping for at least 300, and 1 think 
we may have surpassed that." 

Ready to march: UCSD shows its spirit as over 300 UCSD students get ready to 
participate in the Martin Luther King. Jr. parade held on Saturday downtown.

STUDENTS AND 
ADMINISTRATORS 

TACKLE THE ISSUE OF DIVERSITY 

BY MARK HIXSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
& KIRSTEN HUBBARD STAFF WRITER 

Grin ning from the cover of a booklet titled "Discover UCSD" are seven students. Clockwise from the top, there is an Asian female, a South 
Asian-looking male, a female of undetermined mixed 
heritage, a Hispanic female, a Caucasian male, a 
Caucasian female and an African-American male . 

If the seven students are an accurate sample of the 
entire student body, UCSD's ethnic breakdown would be 
as follows: 14 percent Hispanic, 14 percent African-
American, 28 percent Caucasian, 28 percent Asian and 14 
percent "other." 

Some of this is fairly correct. A 28 percent Asian repre-
sentation is similar to the actllal 35 percent Asian UCSD 
undergraduates, the 26 percent Caucasian representation 
compares to the a.:tual figure of39 percent, and the 14 per-

Policymaker: Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Joseph Watson offers 
opinions on UCSD's undergraduate diversity. 

cent "other" representation is completely accurate. 
However, the 14 percent African-American representa-

tion is far more generous than reality - 1 percent of 
UCSD's undergraduate student body is African-American. 

The cover photo of that booklet - the pages of which 
present statistics and information about UCSD and its 
Sl1ldent body ~ whether intended to accuratel y represent 
the university or not, sticks in the mind of some appli-
cants and ca n influence their decision to apply to and sub-
sequently attend UCSD. 

Muir freshman Leila Dingding is onc such student. 
"When I was applying to colleges, I reall y wanted to 

attend UCSD because they represented themselves as so 
diverse," Dingding said. "Now that I'm actually here, I 
feel kind of like I was deceived." 

Most agree that an environment of diverse tllOught is 
important for a healthy exchange of ideas - a premise on 
which universities are founded. However, there is contro-
versy over how such diversity is best achieved. Some, like 
Dingding, value racial and ethnic diversity, in which 
UCSD lags in comparison to other universiti es in 
Ca lifornia. The UC system, on the other hand, while 
drawing criticism for failing to admit a student popula-
tion that is racially representative of the state, portrays its 
student body as varied in background if not in skin color. 

"The word that best describes the University of 
California student body is diverse," ays. the UC Pathways 
Web site, through which prospective students can learn 
about the UC system and submit applications. 

UCSD because it enriches our lives and the uni-
versity. We celebrate this diversity and support 
respect for all cui tures, by both individuals and the 
university as a whole ... We represent diverse 
races, creeds, cultures, and social affiliations com-
ing together for the good of the university and 
those communities we serve." 

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Joseph 
Watson, when asked about campus diversity, said 
"diversity [at UCSD) is very broad," and that "the 
vast majority of students are satisfied with their 
experience at UCSD." 

The students have opinions of their own. 
"I would feel more comfortable if our school 

were more diverse," Dingding said. "That way, I 
would experience more cultural awareness and 
understanding of our diverse society." 

Dingding completed UCS D's ethnically diverse 
Summer Bridge preparation program before 
school began. She fel t there was a startling contrast 
between the diversity she experienced through this 
program and that of the actual university. 

Muir junior Greg ichols said that UCSD's 
diversity is "pretty good, but some groups arc 
under- or overrepresented . Some changes would 
be beneficial." 

Meanwhile , Marshall junior Tani Topracki 
feel s differently. 

"Our school's level of diversity is OK," 
Topracki said . She feels "people's individuality" is 
more important - and that isn't necessarily 
linked to skin color or ethnic background. 

A.S. President Jeff Dodge said that racial and 
ethnic diversity is crucia l because "it's not just an 
issue of numbers, it 's an issue of perspective." 

Dodge feel s this apparent lack of diversity is 
reAected in the atmosphere on the UCSD campus 
as well as in the quality of education because, he 
said, the college experi ence is not just about class-
es, but the intermingling of unique individuals 
and perspectives. 

"We're lacking in perspective of the world, 
America, culture and a sense of global identity," 
Dodge said. "College is supposed to be a micro-
cosm of society. It's a time to be introduced to the 
basic ideas of other cultures."

Perspectives: Two UCSD students have a discussion on Library Walk. 

However, the numbers of enrolled minority stu-
dents do not reAect the demographics of the state of 
California. 

According to the 2000 census, Caucasians com-
prise 59.5 percent of Calfornia's population. Those 
of Hispanic or Latino origins make up 32.4 percent . 
Asians make up 10.9 percent, African-Americans 6.7 
percent and Native Americans I percent. Persons 
reporting some other race or mixed race descent 
total 21.5 percent. UCSD's figures. as reported 
above, comparatively overrepresent Asians and 
underrepresent all other ethnic and racial groups. 

"It's disturbing," Dodge said. "The lack of ethnic 
diversity impacts [our] education." 

\Matson acknowledges the disparity between 
California's ethnic makeup and that of UCSD. 

"Certainly [the) campus is not reflective of the 
people of California," Watson said . "Certain groups 
are severely underrepresented." 

Watson also said he does not feel that UCSD is 
doing enough to change. 

But studies show the situati on llIay be at least par-
tially self-perpetuating. According to the wlivcr,ity's 
Diversity Council's Web sitc, a survey of minorities 
admitted to UCSD who decided not to atte nd indicate 
two main reasons for their declination: inadequate dis-
tribution of competitive scholarships, and lack of a sig-
nificant number of other minority students. 

It has been argued that another trend i partially 
re ponsible for some students' dissatisfaction with 
UCSD 's ethnic, racial and cultural diversity. 

A.S. Vice President Internal Jennifer Brown sa id 
students themselves may be imposing a barrier to the 
exploration of differences and capitalization on the 
benefits of diversity by not associating with those of 
different backgrounds than their own. 

"Some students are even unable to embrace the 
diversity that is present on campu ," Brown said. 

Edwina Welch, director of the Cross Cultural 
Center, agrees. She said that many campus climate 
issues stem from self-segregation. "You must be able to 
communicate, understand and engage to the best of 
your ability," she said. She said also that to succeed in 
the world, students will need to be open to ideas that 

See DIVERSITY, Page 13 

The Pathways site continues, "You will meet students 
from all walks of life at the university ... Students from 
around the world and the country attend the university, 
but the majority are from California." 

UCSD also promotes ethnic and racial diversity, 
which is apparent within the UCSD Principles of 
Community. It states, "We value the cultural diversity of

Diversity: 
Ethnic organizations 
provide outreach efforts 
Continued from page 11 
lie outside their own experiences. 

"Everybody is impacted [by lack 
of diversity] - some people know 
they are impacted and some people 
don't," Welcb said. "It just depends 
on where the lens is." She said that 
those who think diversity doesn't 
impact them are those who should 
be most concerned. 

Some are wor1cing to turn UCSD 
into a more racially diverse place. 

UCSD is home to a number of 
eilinicity-specific student organiza-
tions such as the Hindu Students 
Council and the African-American 
Student Union. These organiza-
tions work to provide a community 
for members of the ethnic or racial 
groups they serve and often address 
issues of campus diversity. 

Watson advocates such student-
initiated efforts and feds that 
underrepresented students, if con-
cerned, should take on some of the 
responsibility to make UCSD more 
attractive. 

"Any students working construc-
tively to improve the situation should 
be commended," Watson said. 

However, Dodge and Brown 
both cite a lack of financial support 
for diverse student organizations as 
a problem. Without these organi-
zations, they said, underrepresent-
ed students lack needed support in 
the campus community. 

Student opinions reflect contro-
versy over the worth of ethni city-
based organi zations. 

"There are a good number of 
'ethnic' organi7-3tions [on cam pusl, 
but I feel that most are not as active 
as they could be," said Tracy 
Mathews, a Warren senior, as she sat 
behind the Coalition of South Asian 
People booth on Library Walle. 

Mathews feels CSAP "is a start 
at something progressive for peo-
ple like me." 

Nichols has mixed feelings 
about these organizations. 

"They develop unity. I'm not 
involved in one. I'm a white male 
Anglo-Saxon. [There aren't] too 
many groups for me," Nichols said. 

Revelle senior Robert Setterbo 
said he doesn't agree with such 
race- or ethnicity-based organiza-
tions, saying, "They promote unity 
as well as segregation. " 

One of the primary diversity-
oriented groups on campus is the 
Student Affirmative Action 
Committee, an independent body 
that works through the Student 
Affirmative Action and Human 
Relations Program at UCSD. 
SAAC acts to foster communica-
tion among organizations promot-
ing cultural diversity throughout 
the university. It also works in out-
reach and retention of underrepre-
sented groups on campus. 

The Student Affirmative Action 
and Human Relations Program 
Web site claims SAAC "exists to 
facilitate a university environment 
that attracts and nurtures a cultur-
ally diverse student body and pro-
vides equal opportunity and equi ty 
for all students." 

Jennifer Ganata, a Marshall 
junior, is an active SAAC member. 

"In considering higher education, 
some students simply l:ick opportu-
nities that are afforded to others," 
Ganata said, adding that location and 
culture can be strong factors in 
determining these opportunities. 

'We don't have a chance to 
establish a community ... There are 
people wor1cing hard to change [the 
atmospherel, but it's not diverse 
right now. When you look at class-
es, there are no African-Americans 
[and] few Hispanic people; it does-
n't represent California." 

Some students ' desire for diver-
sity applies not only to filling the 
lecture halls - it also applies to the 
selection of the professors and staff 
who make learning possi ble at 
UCSD. But while many faculty 
members and those involved in hir-

Anna Mad.Udo/Guardian 

Across cultures: Students enjoy a moment of relaxation between dasses. 

Ethnicity: 
Ra cial diversity is 
rewarded in hiring 
Continued from page 13 
ing point alit that since the passage 
of Proposition 209, it is prohibited 
in California to exclusively base 
hiring on race or ethnicity. 

However, Ross Frank, chair of 
the Academic Senate Affirmative 
Action and Diversity Committee, 
says that more could be done. 

"Considering diversity as part of 
teaching and mentoring actually 
works under Proposition 209," 
Frank said. 

Federal funding still favors insti-
rutions with diversity that reflects 
workforce demographics, Frank 
said. Proposition 209 allows loop-
holes for insti tutions that risk losing 
their federal funding. For an instiru-
tion to receive optimal funding, its 
hiring practices must match up with 
the demographics of the available 
work force. But the enforcement of 
these guidelines can be lax. 

Watson cited inaction and indif-

ference as the causes of UCSD's 
ethnic makeup . 

"The main srumbling block is 
that [the lack of racial diversity] is 
accepta ble to people; it's not a top 
priority," Warson said . 

W~tson said that increasing eth-
nic diversity is a near-universal 
desire, but when it comes down to 
it, few people make diversity a pri-
ority and "it's not going to happen 
by wishing it." 

Ganata said students like her 
aren't just wishing - they're acting 
to change the university. 

"The student voice is little in 
number, but loud," Ganata said .

Basketball: 
UCSD equals last year's 
win total of three

reserves C). Duffaur and Hassan 
Bassiri . Duffaut subbed for the 
foul-plagued Jody Woods, scoring 
10 points and pulling down a team-
high six rebounds in only 23 min-
utes of play. 

Freshman Hassan Bassiri 
replaced Cameron Jackson, who 
played most of dIe game in foul 
trouble. Bassiri resp0l}ded with his 
best game of the season, scoring 
15 points and grabbing five 
rebounds. 

As usual, UCSD was dominated 
in the paint by its opponents, but 
the Tritons made use of a season-
high 17 three-pointers to put away 
the Wildcats. 

Buoyed by the win, the Tritons 
headed south to take on the UC 
Davis Aggies Saturday night and 
nearly knocked off the CCAA's 
fourth-placed team, losing 86-79. 

Jackson led UCSD with 17 
points, six rebounds and six assists 
- all team-highs. Bassiri again 
played well, adding 15 points 
while shooting three-of- three 
from beyond the arc. 

As a team the Tritons struggled, 
shooting 39 percent from thdield 
and a disappointing 23 percent 
from three-point range. 

UCSD is now ninth out of 12 
teams in the CCAA with a 3-7 
record. 

The three wins already equal 
last season's CCAA win total, and 
the Tritons aren't even halfway 
through the season. The Tritons 
are looking to improve on the sea-

Aggies on the road 
Davis held to a season-low 29.8 
shooting percentage by the Tritons 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's basketball team knew it was 
in for a challenge before it hit the road last weekend. 
On Friday night, the team traveled north to square off 
against seventh-ranked Chico State and lost 61-64. 
The next night, the Tritons found a warmer greeong 
at UC Davis and upset the sixth-ranked Aggies 77-57. 

Against the Wildcats, UCSD beat itself, shooting 
only 32 percent from the field . Leading scorer Ali 
Ginn poured in 28 points - including five three-
pointers - for the Tritons. However, Nicolle Bromley 
was the only other UCSD player to score in double 
figures, finishing with 12 points. Despite shooting less 
then 25 percent from the floor in the first half, the 
Tritons trailed the Wildcats by only nine points. 

Chico State, helped by 24 UCSD turnovers, 
received 38 points from Smilie Glenn and Jennifer 
Kern who scored 19 each. The Wildcats also received 
16 p~ints off the bench from reserve player Kara 
Scheitlin en route to their victory. 

The next night, Ginn again led the Tritons, posting 
a game-high 24 points to secure the win for UCSD. 
Thc first half was back-and-forth between the Tritons 
and the Aggies. After UCSD grabbed a commanding 
42 - 15 lead, Davis responded with a 9-2 run and fin-
ished with only a 28-34 deficit at halftime. 

While the Aggies struggled without center Ranae 
Henning. tile Tritons were unstoppable in the second 
half. beginning the period with a 14-6 run and I.ncreas-
ing their lead to 48-34. UCSD's defense, whIch had 
been inconsistent for much of the sea on, held DaVIS

17 Aggie turnovers. 

Senior Maya Fok also contributed 17 points against 
her former team. Bromley posted 15 points.

UCSD men's basketball coach 
Greg Lanthier has said that th is 
year's team has improved si nce last 
year, when it scraped the bottom of 
the California Collegiate Ath letic 
\ssociation. That may be, bur early 
on-the-court re ults have not 
reflected it. 

This weekend, the Triton 
seemed to realize their potential 
by picking up their first ever

UCSD men's volleyball sank in 
the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation standings this weekend, 
dropping a four-game match with 
University of Southern California 
and a three-game match with 
Pepperdine University. 

As the only Division II team in 
the MPSF - men's volleyball has 
an open National Collegiate 
Athletic Association division -
UC D enters every match as the 
underdog, but it managed to give 
No. 12 USC a scare. 

T he Tritons lost the first game 
only 28-30, but then took the 
Trojans by the same score in the 
second game. T he third and 
fourth games ended 30-20 and 30-
~ 3, respectively. 

"We just had a drop-off after 
the first two games," said UCSD 
head coach Ron Larsen. "Our hit-
ti ng percentages went down and 
we just weren't efficient." 

The Tritons had a team attack 
percentage of .258 and .382 in the 
first twO matches. The team hit .23 I 
and .259 in the latter two games. 

Colin Wolff-Young/Guardian Sophomore Ryan Swed had a 
team-high 20 points and was six for 
II behind the three-point line 
while senior Nick Ch ri stensen 
added 19, including the game-win-
ning three-pointer in overti me with 
42 seconds left. 

Jim Waller led UCSD with 22 
ki lls and a .304 attack percentage, 
while Eric Perrine added 10 with 
an attack percentage of .529. 

"Our middles were strong and 
Eric [Perrine] played well, espe-
cially in the first and second 
games," Larsen said.

RIMACArena.

tandi ng performances from 

See BASKETBALL, Page 18 

The Trojans were led by Brook 
Billings, who had 23 kills, and Josh 
Day, who had 19 kills. 

After the disappointing loss to 

USC, the Tritons entered 
Saturday's match against 
Pepperdine hoping to play like they 
did early on against the Trojans. 

Unfortunately, the visiting 
Waves easily won 30-20, 30-24 
and 30-15. 

"They were just better than 
us," Larsen said. "They all jump 
serve, they played great defense 
and they go to the ball well." 

Waller again led the Tritons 
with 17 kills and a .438 attack per-
centage . Shawn Oksenendler 

added six with a .417 percentage. 
"Jim played well both games," 

Larsen said. "Shawn came off the 
bench to add a spark to our team." 

UCSD returns to action next 
weekend with seventh-ranked UC 
Irvine and second-ranked UCLA.
