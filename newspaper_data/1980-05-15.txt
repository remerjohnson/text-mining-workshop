Officer Honeymoons 
As Confusion ,Reigns 
In Groundwork, Theft 

BY JONATHAN KROLL 
While the UCSD police officer accused of theft at 

Groundwork Bookstore has taken a vacation to get married, 
police and Groundwork spokespersons are telling different 
stories about what hapJ)Ofted Thulladay night. 

Officer David Parhall), who was married Saturday, "had 
some weeks ago scheduled time off," UCSD Police Chief 
Hugh French said. yesterday. 

Parham was on duty from 11 pm to 7 am the night of the 
alleged robbery, French said. 

Both Parham and Groundwork Collective member 
Roberto Riley have fil~ reports with the police. Riley says he 
saw Parham take bilTs from the cashbox in the collective's 
Student Center office. 

French said he would not release the reports because "we 
do not tty our cases in the newspapers." 

Parham, who srent four years with the San Diego City 
Police before jo~g the UCSD force, "has done an above 
average job in tile time he has been here (12 months)," 
French said. : 

Parham was unavailable for comment. 
Although UCSD police will continue to investigate the 

incident, French emphasized that no bills were found to be 
missing from the cashbox when Riley and the police counted 
the Groundwork receipts together Thursday. 

Riley, who originally would not talk to the press because he 
said he feared harassment, told his story yesterday. He said 
he thought that Parham had returned the money to the 
cashbox after being confronted. 

According to Riley, small amounts of money had been 
missing from the cashbox beginning in February and 
continuing through May, but "you couldn't pin down-when it

Air Traffic Control Upgrading 
Seen As Step in Right Direction 

AP - An air traffic control plan that takes 
effect today in the San Diego area aimS' at 
preventing another collision like the 1978 one 
that kitled 144 people. 

Few pilots are happy with the Terminal 
Control Area, or TCA, imposed by the Federal 
Aviation Administratio'n, but they generally call 
it a step in the right direction. 

The 250,000-member Aircrah Owners and 
Pilots Association, representing private pilots, 
contends it may add to the dangers in San 
Diego's over·crowded skies by putting too big an 
area under mandatory controls. 

Starting today, private planes must have 
electronic equipment costing upwards of 
$1,000 to feed data to the FAA's air traffic 
controllers. 

Although controllers wanted the TCA, many 
have protested that they are undermanned for it. 

'Spokesmen for the Professional Air Traffic 
Contro lers Association say no increase has 
been authorized in the size of the San Diego staff 
even though the FAA predicts the workload will 
increase between 10 and 20 percent. 

The TCA defines a block of airspace 
surrounding San Diego International Airport, 
known as LindberBh Field. Twenty other US 
cities have TCAs. Planes may be flown through 
TCAs only if they meet strict equipment and 
operational standards. 

The planes must have a transponder, which 
sends an electronic signal to the radw:sc0pe5 of 
air traffic controllers. The signal gives 
controllers the identity, direction and speed of 
each plane. 

If a TCA had been in effect' of Sept. 28, 
1978, it might have prevented the wont plane 
collision in US history, according to a number of 
pilots who testified at subsequent hearings.

Anti-Racketeering Trial Erodes Right 
Guilt by Association Admissible Against Hell'~ Angels Under Sacrosanct New RICO Law 

BY ELIZABEll{ GA TOV 
AND ALAN RAMO 
Pacific New. Service 

SAN FRANCISCO - A 
macabre, mass trial of the 
Hells Angels motorcycle 
gang, being conducted· in 
federal court here, is providing 
obeerver. with a rare glimpse 
into the sometimes seamy, 
often 'violent world of narcotics 
trafficking. But behind the 
upward drama of crime lies a 
little discussed act of law that 
could have a profound effect 
on the future of American 
justice. 

The trial itself has turned 
into a three· ring circus in 

The law goes well 
beyond the old 
c~nspiracy laws 
which Federal District Judge 
Samuel Conti presides in 
center ring, flanked by the 
colorful antin of 18 
defendants and their 
attorneys, on one side, and an 
equally colOrful and rotating 
group of spectators on the 
other. 

The case is easdy the most 
complex criminal trial ever 
conducted in San Francisco. It 
is also the longest, having 
begun in October, ]979, and 
expected to continue 
indefinitely. It is probably ' the 
moat' expensive trial ever 
conducted here, running into 
hundreds of thousands of 
doDars. And, according to US 
Attorney William Hunter, 
who is prosecuting the case, it 
is setting a record for the 
greatest number of defendants 
ever charged'in one case under 
RICO. 

RICO is the federal 
Racketeer Influenced and 
Corrupt Organizations Act, 
passed 10 years ago to make 
is easier for the government to 

crack down on organized 
crime, as opposed to 
individual crimes. 

The use of the RICO statute 
in the HeDs Angels case may 
be the least talked about 
feature of the trial, but to some 
legal observers it is also the 
most significant: 
' If the government 

prosecutors are successful in 
this case, critics say , we can 
expect expanded use of RICO, 
perhaps against organizations 
which are more political than 
criminal. 

Such con ems have received 
little more than lip service by 
most libertarians, due in part 
to the generally unpopular 
nature of the defendants , and 
in part to the public support for 
the government's war on 
organized crime. But the 
concerns ovei RICO and its 
future use are real, even if few 
critics have gone public. 

The specific criticism of the 
RICO law is that it enables 
prosecutors to convict 
defendants through guilt by 
association. The law makes it 
a separate federal crime for an 
individual to participat~ in a 
pattern of racketeering al part 
of any organization involved 
in interstate commerce. The 

• paltern can be as limited as 
two criminal acts ten years 
apart. 1be law also makes it a 
crime to participate in any 
racketeering enterprise. 

The penalties are severe, up 
to 20 years .in federal prison 
and fines of $25,000. 

The RICO law goes well 
beyond the old conspiracy 
laws, which so often failed to 
win convictions against anti-
war activists in the late-1960s. 
Under the old doctrine, mere 
member$hip in an organiza-
tion was inadmissible as 
evidence, and the acta of one 
co· defendant were not binding 
on another unless it could be 
proven that they arose out of 
collusion. 

Under RICO, all such 
evidence is admissible. 
Indeed, the prosecution in the 
Hells Angels' trial contends 
that by the mere act of taking 
an oath of loyalty to the 
Angels, one was already 
entering a criminal conspira. 
cy. Prosecutors claim that the 
Angels' b,ylaws specifically 
require members to agree to 
sell drugs and to agree tb 
commit murders, assaults and 
bribes if necessary to protect' 
the organization. 

The Angels deny having 
any such bylaws . They 
contend their organization is 
chargered as a dub devoted to 
"the promoting and advance· 
ment of motorcycle driving .. . 
highway safety and all phases 
of motorcycles and motor· 
cycle driving." . 

Thus, the Question becomes 
one of whether the Angels 
<;ol)stitute an organized· drug 
racket or whether they are 
merely a motorcycle club, the 

members of which may have 
engaged in independent 
criminal acts. If the 
government can convince the 
jury of the former , then it is 
easier to win convictions on 
the specific criminal charges 
themselves. 

While the 18 defendants are 
charged with a variety of 
different crimes , contributing 
to a criminal enterprise, each 
one is also charged under 
RICO with entering into the 
criminal enterprise by virtue of 
membership' in the Angels. 

Even 10 years ago, when 
the statute was being 
I;onsidered by Congress , 
Representative John Conyers 
(D.·Mich) objected that it 
opened the way for a 
prosecution of a normal family 
which hosted two poker games 
for money during a 10-year 
period. 

Of course the Hells Angels 
are not a normal family by 
anyone's definition, as the 

bizarre courtroom scene 
reveals. The ] 8 defendants, 
mostly big and burly, sit along 
two tiers of tables with their 
individual attorneys behind 
them. In front of each 
defendant is an identification 
plaque like those used on 
executive desks; useful , no 
doubt, because of the

ship in the Angels

similarity of appearance. 

Behind a glass shield at the 
back of the room are three 
rows of seats for spectators, 
many filled with rotating shifts 
of other Hells Angels in 
ornamented leather Ijackets, 
along with their girl friends, 
women members and a 
number of children. 

What Drug Do You Take to See What? 
Duck's Breath A TYPical ··" ; 

\ I Dos~ of Today's Mentality 
BY MICHAEL McKEE 

The phrase "The world is 
going to hell in a hand-basket" 
has by now begun to be widely 
accepted by even today's 
youth; many believe that the 
big number III is inevitable. 
With the threat of the ultimate 
impending doom continually 
increasing, it is not surprisi.ng 
to find a sharp rise in mental 
short-circuiting among college 
students. This short·circuiting 
phenomenon has warped our 
moral values, instilled a 
paranoic fear of the future, 
virtually obliterated optimism, 
increased drug use and, most 
noticeably, demented our 
senle of entertainment. 

So I sat there smiling, 
grasping my Black RUllian 
with both hands, staring wide· 
eyed at the fish tank and 
listening to the B·528 at full 
volume . 

"Look at Mike," Steve 

laughed. ' ''He looks like he 
needs to see Duck's Breath." It 
took me a while, but I finally 
slurred, "What kind of drug do 
you take to see that?" 

"You look in prime 
condition to see them," Kyle 
blurbed. . 

"How many ducks?" I 
asked . 

"Four of them," said Bruno, 
shoving a burrito in and 
around his mouth. 1 stared at 
them in bewilderment. "You're 
all drunk," I concluded. 

"Yea, we are, but how many 
different drugs are you on?" 
asked Kyle. I thought for a 
while, sort of, then said, "Five. 
Seven if you count the caffein 
and nicotine." 

Before I realized it, I was 
staggering along with my 
friends on my way to see 
Duck's Brea'h: The drunk 
leading the drunk. 

"What's Duck' Breath?" I 

ventured. 
"They're a very funny 

comedy team." "Sounds 
weird to me." 

"Yes, yes, they are really 
strange," someone assented. 

"GOod." . 
As it turned .out, Duck's 

Bre&th Mystery Theatre was a 
sort of touring band of free-
lance professors who lecture 
on various areas of intellectual 
interest, from Theatre to 
exotic customs. As a bonus, 
God made a special 
appearance. He said that 
various forms of low·life were 
demanding that they be 
boosted up the evolutionary 
ladder. Among the forms of 
life was Psilocybin, who was 
very confused. He said that he 
had seen a movie and a pair of 
really brown shoes that grew 
Iells. Poor lillie guy. 

Then we had our lesson on-
Sexual Kinetics, which I had a 
hard time understanding, but 
did learn about the use of 
condominiums and Diagram . 
The most informative of the 
dissertations was about 

different people of the world. 
We were shown the sacred 
dance from Kansas where four 
people, dressed in manure 
suits, chant the seldom heard 
words, "Heen-kaya Hinca." 
Then someone from Scotland 
tried to explain why they wear 
dresses, but we all know the 
real reason. 

newfound knowledge, I could 
swear that the world was a bit 
more clear to me. For the first 
time I understood why the 
landscape kept spinning 
around me, why my hands 
shook, and I knew that the 
Silly slate would will the AS 
Elections. But when I woke the 
next morning aU that was left 
of my en~ghtenment was a 
headache. Walking home with my

3.0;000' Students 
Paralyze Seoul 

SEOUL, South Korea -
Demonstrating students 
poured into downtown Seoul 
yesterday paralyzing traffic 
and clashing with police in 
anti·government protests . 
Police vehicles were burned 
and wrecked in one of the five 
provincial cities where 
demonstrations took place . 

The government' placed 
troops and armored personnel 
carriers around the capitol 
building as the number of 
demonstrators estimated in 
Seoul alone increased to 
30,000. It was not known how 
many demonstrators were 
involved outside Seoul. 

Riot police , armed with 
clubs and tear gas, were 
outnumbered here, but troops 
armed with rifles did not join 
poli c e in fighting the 
demonstrators. At least 200 
students were arrested . 

The volume and size of the 
demonstrations reminded 
some observers of the 
uprisings that toppled the 
government of president 
Syngman Rhee in 1960. 

The slogan·chanting 
students took to the rain· swept 
streets of Seoul demanding the ' 

~fting of martial law and the 
resignation of new military 

strongman Lt. Gen. Chun 
Doo-hwan. 

The most violent demon· 
stration of the day erupted in 
Taegu, Korea's third largest 
city 140 miles south of Seoul. 
About 50.0 students 
reportedly set fire to a 
policebus and wrecked three 
other police vehicles while 
destroying two police sub· 
stations . 

In Seoul, students poured 
onto the Chongro, one of 
Seoul ' s busiest streets , 
paralyzing traffic on the eight. 
land roadway and forcing 
many shops to roll down their 
shutters. 

This was the second straight 
day of demonstrations by 
students alter about two weeks 
of anti-government campus 
rallies. 

·Gas Tax on Hold; 
Courts Discuss 

WASHINGTON - The 
Carter administration 
conceded yesterday that the 
president ' s dime·a.gallon 
gasoline fee will not go into 
effect today as planned, even 
though the government is 
seeking to quickly overturn a 

judge's 
levy. 

On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, 
Treasury Secretary C. 
Wiiliam Miller urged Congress 
to delay action on the fee while 
the appeal is pending. 

Energy Department general 
counsel Lynn R. Coleman said 
the administration decided not 
to press for an appeals court 
order that might allow 
imposition of the fee by today, 
the day it was scheduled to 
take effect. 

Instead, Coleman asked for 
- and received - from US 
District Judge Aubrey E. 
Robinson Jr. an order that 
requires companies that would 
be affected by the fee to 
maintain appropriate records , 
giving the administration the 
ability to Quickly impose the 
fee if the appeals court 
reverses Robi nson' s decision 
of Tuesday which blocked the 
levy. 

Coleman said the adminis· 
tration would file later today its 
appeals briefs with two 
appellate courts - the US 
Court of Appeals for the 
District of Columbia and the 
Temporary Emergency Couri 
of Appeals. 

Muskie Urges 
Iran Sanctions 

BRUSSELS, Belgium -
US Secretary of State Edmund 
S. Muskie yesterday urged the 
European allies to apply 
meaningful economic 
.sanctions against Iran, 
declaring that ingenuity, not 
force, offers the best hope for 
freeing the American 
hostages. 

" Make them see they must 
pay a price," was his message 
to the NATO Defense 
Planning Commit!ee. 

Muskie urged foreign and 
defense ministers from 13 of 
the ] 5 NATO allies to 
increase their defense 
spending while the United 
States guards the Persian Gulf 
against the Soviets. 

World Harvest 
ToT op Records? 

WASHINGTON - World 
grain production could rise 
significantly in 1980·81 and 
"may even exceed" the record 
output of two years ago, says 
the Agriculture Department. 

But the experts admit a lot 
will depend on the weather in 
the United State&, the Soviet 
Union and other key grain 
areas . 

"Early reports indicate a 
rise of almost 2 percent in the 
areas under wheat and coarse 
grains such as com ~ 
barley," the report said. 

Legis!ature May 
Cut 9's Impact 

SACRAMENTO - Some 
Assembly members said 
Proposition 9 should be 
allowed to win or lose on its 
own meriis - without a nudge 
from the Legislature. 

The bill, AB3020 by 
Assemblyman Charles 
Imbrecht, R-Ventura, is aimed 
at reducing the $4.9 billion 
that Proposition 9 would 
otherwise keep out of the stale 
coffers. 

The legislative logic is, the 
voters might fear that $4.9 
billion is too much, and reject 
Proposition 9. But if they knew 
it would cost the stale only 
$2.9 bil~on - at least this 
year - they might approve it.

was going to happen ." Several 
members of the Collective 
began taking -&urns "staking 
out" the bookstore, he said. 

A week ago last Wednes-
day night, Roberto took his 
turn staking out the bookstore. 
Before positioning himself 
under a couch, directly behind 
the desk in which the cashbox 
was kept, Roberto recorded 
the amount and aerial numbers 
of the bills in the box. 

Roberto also wiped the 
calhbox clean in order to J(et 

clear fingerprints, and readied 
his tape recorder. He then hid 
under the couch and behind 
some boxes positioning 
himself so he could see out. 

Shortly after 5 am, Riley 
says he saw a UCSD police 
officer enter the store with a 
key. While Riley "never got a 
look at his face ," he said he 
could tell that it was an officer 
by the clothing the officer was 
wearing. 

Riley said the officer took 
some bills from the cashbox, 
and moved them toward his 

pocket. Riley did not aclually 
see the bills being put in the 
officer's pocket, because of his 
"restricted view" behind the 
boxes. 

Riley also saw and heard 
the officer pick up some 
quarters, but again he did not 
see the officer put them in his 
pocket . 

Riley's initial reaction was 
to "hold my breath to keep 
from making noise." 

Riley said the store was 
dark, but two lights outside 
provided enough light to see. 

A her the officer had left, 
Riley said he put on his 
backpack with the tape 
recorJer and left the store to 
find out who it was." 

When Riley came out of the 
store, a Ilolice car (number 
P2) was outside in the 
adjoining access road, and an 
officer was close to the store. 
Riley began a conversation 
with the officer outside the 
store, and tried to get the 
officer to say he had been in 
the store. Riley told him he saw 
him go into the store. 

Riley said that the officer 
told him he got into the store 
with a key. 

"He admits readily. that he 
was in the store. He said he 
went in for 'security reasons'. 

Riley asked if the policeman 
would let him into the store, 

bu~ was refused. Riley wanted 
to get back in to "call other 
members of the collective and 
count the money." 

After that, Riley tried to find 
a spot where he could "watch

inserting isolated genes that 
code for certain important 
human and animal products 
directly mto living bacteria. A 
bacterium, having incorpora-
ted the foreign gene into its 
own genetic sequence, now 
follows the Dew gene's 
"inatructiolll:' and manufac-
tures the vital product. It will 
multiply so that from a single 
cell we may get millions of 
progeny cells that produce that 
same material. As Dr. Donald 
Helenski, chairman of the 
Biology Department, says, 
"with recombinant DNA 
techniques, we can convert 
rapidly growing bacteria or 
yeasl cells into literal factories 
toward the production of 
important human or animal 
gene products." 

Recombinant DNA techno-
logy has presented the medical 
world with some very 
promising possibilities, for 
example the production of 
human inlulin, or even more 
importantly, the production of 
human interferOA, a subltance 
tho! has potential as an anti-
viral or anti-tumoral agent to 
help in the fight against 
cancer. According to 
Helenski, "these gene 
produds before the develop-
ment of recombinant DNA, . 
have been available, but it has 
been excruc:iatin,ty painful to 
obtain sufficient amounts ' of 
them." 

But the use of recombinant 
DNA technology extends 

even beyond the medical 
world. Scientists hope that the 
agricultural world will a110 
reap the benefits provided by 
the new technology. 

A possibility that is already 
the focus of much research is 
the genetic engineering of a 
bacterium called Rhizobium 
which is responsible for 
biological nitrogen fixation in 
plants. Plants that normally 
require expensive fertilizer 
may now "fix " nitrogen 
directly from the air. 

Helenski's laboratory here 

Dr. Donald H,-linlki, 
UCSD Bioloaist 

i. working with Rhizobium and 
experimenting with the use of 
recombinant DNA techni-
ques. "In our laooratory, it has 
become a technology to 
modify Rhizobium so that it is 
more effective as a biological 
nitrogen fixer to provide for 
more protein rich plants." 

According to Helenski, 
"this type of research i. going 
to be important and will be 

taken advantage of in the 
future." With predictions of "a 
great food shortage in the n~xt 
few decades" due to 
population increase, "it is 
going to be extremely 
important to experiment with 
technology on a recombinant 
DNA level. Medical 
technology provides sub-
stances that haven't been 
available to us before, but also 
the agricultural area is 
providing for plants thai have 
better growth properties, that 
are nutritionally better, and 
are more resistant to poor soil 
conditions, " says Helenski. 

According to the Office of 
Technology Assessment, 
other achievements through 
recombinant DNA research 
include manufactured and 
natural foods, scavengers of 
pollutants, concentrators of 
scarce materials and products 
from biomass. 

So, from existing evidence, 
there is no doubt that 
recombinant DNA technology 
may become a very important 
part. o.f society's future 
functlomng. 

There is also much 
controversy, however, over 
deciding which people will 

primar~y control the new 
technology. Many believe that 
once recombinant DNA 
technology and its products hit 
the money market, the wheels 
for turning scientific research 
into profit will begin to roll, 
crushing any original 
beneficial intentions .. 

univer~ity laboratories to small associates in recombinant 
companies and even to major DNA research feel the same 
corporations. Genetech, Cetus way: "I think the bulk of 
Corp. , Biogen, and Genex are scientists in this field are very 
some of the forerunners in this supportive of the idea of 
sudden interest and action in . 
revolutionizing chemical and 
pharmaceutical production by 
incorporating DNA techno-
logy. These companies were 
some of the first to realize and 
take advantage of the fact that 
recombinant DNA techniques 
could , in the long run, lower 
the costs for the manufacture 
of chemical and pharmaceuti . 
cal products by about 30 to 50 
percent. 

Many big companies in the 
chemical industry are signing 
co ntr ac t s with genetic 
engineering specialists. Others 
have set up recombinant DNA 
research groups in their own 
labs. Brokers are following 
requests from investors to put 
money behin~ genetic 
engineering ventures. 

And yet, even with all of 
these money and profit 
motivated moves and the 
rising competition involved, 
there are those who remain 
optimistic and truly believe 
that the commercial 
application of genetic 
engineering technology will be 
a beneficial development. 
According to these people, 
taking reasearch knowledge 
out of the labs and applying it 
to produce valuble products is 
a humanitarian endeavor that 
has tremendous potential for 
helping society.

developments for commercial 
purposes . That is, taking 
research from the laboratories 
and providing practical ways

He also sees the profit angle 
of it as an unavoidable aspect 
and believes that it actually 
provides incentive for the 
utili za tion of the new 
recombinant DNA technology 
available to us. "It is expected 
that people who are involved 
with this should do it for a 
profit. I could think that one of 
the major reasons why our 
own research is being 
supported by the federal 
government, while it is largely 
basic in its nature, is that it is 
known that something will 
develop that can be applied,

Down Honte Blues 'Welconted At The Beach 
"I don't care where I play, 

as long as the band is good," 
said Joe T umer last month 
between sets at' the Belly·Up 
Tavern in Solana Beach. Yet 
he must at times pause to 
contemplate the vast gulf 
separating those early Kansas 
City saloons where he first

bar to belt out his big-voiced

his Del Tones. 

Whatever thoughts may 
cross his mind, Big Joe's vocal 
chords and artistic resolve 
remain urrwavering. He no 
longer gets around very well, 
but he sat on the edge of the 
stage and proceeded to wail a 
nearly nonstop succession of 
his standards, proving that he 
is still up to the job. Backed by 
an excellent seven-piece unit 
of San Diego and Los Angeles 
musicians assembled for the 
occasion, Turner swung his 
way through "Corrina,

Door In (And Had to Take thl'!

I Have the Blues," "Come On, 
Baby, Let's Play Hide and

And then: "I don't need no

derelict surfer, clad in shorts, 
hawaiian shirt and sandals, 
took up residence on his back 
beneath a table directly below 
the stage where Thornton sat, 
attired in a natty gray wool suit 
and ten gallon straw hat, and 
began to annoy her. She 
started out fairly easy on him: 
"Man, I'm up here tryin' to put 
on a show, and you're 'down

Failing, she tried to shame him 
morally: "At least I don't sleep

How Does this Guy Get Away

Thug of Love - Dirk 
Hamilton (Elektra) 

You, the reader of this 
publication, probably are 
exposed to new rock music 
through listening to the radio 
or· perhaps the adyice of 
record-buying friends. Either 
way, I'll wager that you've 
heard next to nothing of the 
music ' of Dirk Hamilton, a 
California-based singer/song-
writer who has released four 
LP. of original material since 
1976. 

Now, I'll also bet that you 
expect me to go on to say how 

deprived you are ' of this 
obscure genius ' particular 
talents. Uh·uh. There's no real 
reason why you should regret 
never hearing Hamilton, 
because his musical abilities 
are such that you wouldn't find 
much to like about him. I don't 
like him , and I've chosen to 
select his Thug Of Love 
album to dissect over dozens 
of worthier records. Why the

That's just it - Dirk 
Hamilton is so unlikeable that 
he almost draws you to him at 
odd moments (if you've heard 
him) by his sheer repulsive-
ness. This guy is fascinating 
because I cannot figure out 
who his audience could be or 
even what he's talking about 
half the time. Why is this man 
making records? Is he 
blackmailing the head of 
Elektra Records or what? 
Such questions cause me to 
ruminate over the strange case 
of Dirk Hamilton, Thug Of 
Love , Gasabag Poet , 
MlD'Ilbling Mindral of Our 
limes. 

What do we know about 
this man? He plays guitar and 
sings in a slurred,' gruff warble 
reminiscent of Van Morrison 
after a shot of codeine. He 
thinks he has something witty 
and profound to say about 
Modern Life, and over the 
course of four albums has 
convinced such name session 
musicians as Larry Carlton, 
Bill Payne and Garth Hudson 
to help him.get his message out 
to The People. What he has to 
offer potential listeners is a 
cockeyed lyrical approach

'Tin DruDl' Marches to New Wave Cinemas Beat 
Werner Herzog's Woyzcek and Rainer 

Werner Fassbinder's The Marriage Of Maria 
Braun are the products of the German New 
Wave cinema that have been received with 
open arms by their American audiences, and as 
a result, place high expectations for continued 
excellence upon the latest import, Volker 
Schloendorff's The Tin Drum. The Iilm fulfills 
them with little or no effort. 

The picture, adapted from the Gunter Grass 
novel, reaccounts the life of Oskar Matzerath, a 
withdrawn three year·old bov, who, disgusted 
by the sight of drunken guests at his birthday 
party, decides to stop growing. He succeeds in 
the task, and for the next 17 years , undergoes a 
series of Tom Thumb.inspired adventures. 
Two of them, the discovery that he has a 
scream that shatters glass and the playing of a 
tin drum that turns a Nazi rally into an outdoor 
waltz, enable the boy to travel through World 
War II Europe as a member of a troupe of 
wandering entertainers. Oskar 's extended 
childhood is marked by tragedy, in the form of 
adultery and suicide, and national tragedy, the

Danzig in ruins and turns him into a war 

. orphan. It is at this point that Oskar, now 20 
years·old, must make a critical decision : to 

into the adult world , signified by physical 
growth. 

Gunter Grass' novel comes to stunning and 
unsettling reality through the screen adaptation 
by Jean·Claude Carriere, Scholendorfl and 
Franz Seitz. At times, Scholendorff's direction 
seems somewhat stoic, but given the film's 
setting, such a mood is justified, and the Bravity 
is punctuated by the wry humor of Oakar's 
voiceover narration. Igor Luther's 
cinematography is filled with stark images that 
exert their own separate energy, while Suzanne 
Baron's editing serves to magnify such power. 

David Bennent's role as Oskar could be 
considered almost autobiographical, as he, like 
the young protagonist, had stopped growing at 
an early age. The 13 year-old's acting is 
remarkable, but the most memorable aspect of 
his portrayal are his wide bulbous eyes, which 
hold an expression that is haunting and 
prophetic. Angela Winkler's conscience·striken 
Agnes, Heinz Bertnent's dutiful Alfred, and 
Daniel Olbrychski's compassionate Jan are 
equally as resonant. Catharina Thalback and 
Mariella Oliveri are well cast in their parts as 
Oskar's first love, Maria, and wartime romantic 
interest, Roswitha.

experience for biologists. 
Physicists and chemists have 
had many dose relationships 
with industry for a number of 
years, but it is only recently 
that, with breakthroughs that 
have occurred in the biological 
sciences, biologists have been 
IOUghe out by commercial 
enterprises for involvement in 
commercial production." 

He adds, "some of us now 
are trying to work out what the 

proper kinds of involvement 
are in a relationship with 
commercial corporations. 
Personally, I see nothing 
wrong with academic 
scientists involved In 
consulting commercial 
companies as long as they 
contam their consulting within 
guidelines. The main 
requirement here is that the 
consultant does not take 
himself out of the role which is 
expected of a faculty person, 

namely teaching and doing 
research for the community. I 
think that these obligations are 
especially important. We must 
be extremely careful with 
regard to having any 
commercial interest interfere 
with academic research." 

He believes that corpora·

same restrictions In their

"I cared about watching the 
store to make sure he didn't go 
back in," said Riley. R~ey was 
unable to keep both in sight, 
however, for approximately 
20 minutes. 

"I didn't know what t~ do. 
At one rint in that 20-minute 
interva, I found rpysell 
walking toward the police 
Itation to report it." 

Halfway there he changed 

his mind and went back to the 
boo~store, where two other 
policemen had arrived. 

One' officer "claimed that 
UCSD police have keys to all

any reason to go where they 
want to go. The only 
exceptions are certain

arrangements and bleary-eyed

Unroll The Wheel World," 
"The Main Attraction" and 
" Wholly Bowled Over." The 
most notable cut is "Moses 
And Me, " where the 
songwriter IS apparently 
comparing himself to Jesus 
Christ because he has to 
endure billboards and live in 
Los Angeles. The unremitting 
arrogance of Hamilton to write

that you stick out the rest of the
