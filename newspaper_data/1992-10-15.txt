MEChA Protests Columbus Day 
By PhIlip MIchaels 
Senior Staff Writer 

The 5roh anniversary of Christopher 
Colwnblls' arrival in America was maned 
by the placing of cardboard coffInS around 
campus and a Monday evening rally thai 
condemnedColwnbus' "conquest of the New 
World" 

Araceli Garcia, president of Movimiento 
Esturuantil Chicano de Azllan (MEOlA), 
described the events as a chance to raise the 
level of cultural awareness on campus. 

"TIus is a night of awareness and educa-
tion about the true meaning of Christopher 
Colwnbus Day," Garcia said at the evening 
rally co-sponsored by MEOlA and the inter-
national Oub. 

Earlier in the day, MEOlA placed seven 
cardboard coffins around campus. Written on 
each of the coffins was information from 
"Rethinking Columbus," an educational 
magazineabouttheslaughterofNativeAmeri-
cans dwing Colwnbus' era. 
~ of the coffins read "Did you know 

that in 1492, there were three million Tainos 
Indians in North America? Fifty years after 
Columbus' anival, there were only 200." 

According to members of MEOlA, the 
coffins had been damaged during the day. 
Many of the coffInS had been kicked in, and 
one had been visibly spat upon. 

JuanAstorga,amemberofMEChA,said 
that one of the coffins in Revelle Plaza had 
been labeled with a sign reading ''~id you 
know this was bullshitT 

"Our general reaction is sadness. This is 
supposed to be a center for highereducation," 
Astorga said of the vandalism. "We're nying 
to bridge the gap of racism, sexism and 
homophobia," he added. 

Garcia also ex~ sadnes.s over the 
darnage done to the coffins. "It disappoints me 
to see that people still can't have respect for 
other people's culture," he said. 

Monday evening's rally, called the Raza 
Cultural Awareness Night, was attended by 
approximately ISO UCSD students. Amalilca

ROTC Program 
Cancelled, Polley 
Violation Cited 
MIUTARY: Committee on Education Policy 
ays ROTC program is contrary to UCSD's 

academic mis ion, non-di crimination policy 
By FrancIsco DeVries 
News Editor 

U SD students will no longl!r be permined to enroll in the 
Reserve Officer Tmining Corps (ROTC) progmlll. and Sludent\ 
already in the program will receive noacademiccredit afterthis year. 

The "crosstown agreement" that allowed UCSO student" to 
enroll in ROTC at the Univen;iry of .U1 Diego (U D) will not be 
renewed after this year. 

Currently, UCSDstudent wi~hingtoenroll in ROTCmu!>t tmvel 
twice a week to USD for clas.'>es. 

Political Science Profe !.Or Peter Irons sent a leiter to the UCSO 
Comminee on Educati n Policy (CEP) last year. recommending 
that the program be terminated. 

Irons ci ted discrimination based on sexual orientation and the 
lack of connection with UCSO's academic mission as reasons for 
requesting the change in policy. 

'The ROTC progmm violates univen;ity policies on sexual 
discrimination ... the university ha5 a very firm policy on that. . .. It 
is [also] not even rem tely connected with UCSO'. academic 
mission," said Iron . 

United States military policy does not allow gays, lesbians or 
bisexual to join the armed forces and dismisses tho~ who admit to 
their homosexuality after joining. 

last year's CEP Chair, Biology Professor Douglass Smith, 
presided over the committee's decision. He said that the cEP Wa5 
"historically opposed"to the ROTC program. but that the lener from 
Irons "gave the CEP an excuse to look at I the issuel once again." 

This year's CEPChair. Political Science Profe 'sorSarn Kemell. 
said that the progrnm 's cancellation "Wa5 something that had been 
in the works for some time." 

AccordingtominutesfromtheCEPmeetingonJune 12, Warren 
Provo t David Wong argued that "there is no program or course at 
UCSD remotely resembling ROTC and that diverting students' 
efforts to such activities has no academic value and may unduly 
prolong students time-to-degree." 

The minutes also state that "the [ROTC! programs operate in 
violation of the spirit and the letter of university regulations in terms 
of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation:' 

Captain George Love of the Naval ROTC program at USD said 
that he did not believe the decision was motivated by sexual 
orientation discrimination or academic differences. 

'The whole NROTC program nationwide has been ... getting 
smaller along with the whole military !:.tructure," he said. 

Love also said that UCSD would be losing an important element

A.S. and Co-ops Begin Negotiations On Oversight 
By Karen Cheng 
Associate News Editor 

Negotiations are continuing be-
tween the A ociated Students and 
the co-ops ona last minute propo alto 
avoid eviction of the tudent-run bu i-
nesses 

Under a propo al made by A sis-
tant Vice Chancellor of Student Pro-
grams and Facilities Tom Tucker last 

" week.theAS. woulda5sume liability 
and accountability for aU aspects of 
the co-ops, 

But the issue of autonomy for the 
A.S. is still a major point of conten-
tion. In a response to Tucker's letter, 
A,S. President Mike Holmes wrote 
that, "The AS. is nO( its own associa-

tion, in fact it is a University depart-
ment without control over its funds or 
taff. .. it may be legally premature, 

then, to implement the propo al that 
you have outlined in your letter." 

In his written response, Holmes 
called for an interim agreement be-
tween the AS., the university and the 
co-ops which would allow time for the 
discussion of a possible change of status 
for the A.S. within the university. 

'The agreement would be on an 
interim, annual basis, until a change 
in the university status (a move to-
ward greater autonomy) which may 
involve the A.S., the Graduate Stu-
dent Association (GSA), the Univer-
sity Center Board, (UCB), and other 

student groups, was agreed upon and 
established," the letter states. 

The co-ops and the AS. have now 
begun negotiations on Tucker'S pro-
posal and terms for a new AS.-co-ops 
agreement. 

According to Holmes, negotiations 
are going well, but "l}Ything is set in 
stone." Holme said that before any-
thing is signed, the AS. needs its own 
legal counsel. 

"We came up with ome good 
ideas ... however, there are concerns 
on the AS. 's part, as we feel that we 
need to get independent legal counsel 
on this matter, even if just to review 
what we've done ... the university is

'Snake Path' To Be Inaugurated 
The eleventh sculpture created for the Stuart Art 

Collection at UCSD will be offiCially inaugurated on 
Saturday, Oct. 24 at 3:30 p.m. 

The sculpture. entitled "Snake Path : is located on 
the east side of the Central Library and measures 560 
feet from tail to tongue. 

Artist Alexis Smith used slate tiles to represent the 
snake's scales and pink granite for the tongue. Near 
the top of the sculpture Is a small "Garden of Eden" in 
which various trees and exotic plants have been placed, 
along with a granite bench engraved with a depiction of 
Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. 

According to Smith, whose paradise theme is 
prevalant in her other works as well, the Â·Snake Path" 
sets up a metaphor for the university. Students who 
enter eventually move out into the world, using the 
knowledge gained at UCSD as a guide she said. 

The project was funded by grants from the National 
Endowment for the Arts, the Stuart FoUndation and 
various other public and private donors. 

Upcoming Stuart projects include a giant picnic 
table covered with text and a sunken granite seating 
area. 

FIve Supporters Join UCSD 
foundation ao.d of 1'rusteM 

The UC San Diego Foundation has welComed five 
new members to its Board of Trustees, Chancellor 
Richard Atkinson said. The foundation is a no~orrt 
organization charged with raiSing and ffi()~ing private 
support for UCSD. 

"As the university enters an era of increasingly tight 
budgets and limited state funds, private support from 
the community is more important to UCSD than ever 
before: said Jerome Katzin, president of the Board of 
the UC San Diego Foundation. 'These new board mem-
bers are all prominent and accomplished citizens who, 

I am sure, will contribute signifteantly to the growth and 
success of the university." 

According to Katzin, the last 10 years have seen an 
increase from $9 million to $68.9 million in the assets 
raised by the foundation. The market value of endow-
ment funds invested in the UCSD foundation has 
increased from $3.7 to $26.8 million in the same ten-
year period.

Prize for Literature during a lecture on Tuesday night. 
By Krista Carpenter 
Guardian Reporter 

Nobel Laureate Nadine Gordimer. who went from 
having her books banned in her native South Africa to 
being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1991, 
spoke about "Writing and Being" Tuesday night at the 
UCSD Price Center. 

Honored for her 1llOre than 40 years of fiction on lhe 
realities of apanheid. Gordimer said she feel ' that nOIhing 
could ever be lI! truthful as her fiction. 1bree of her books 
have been banned 
in the past because, 
as she acknowl-
edges. "writing be-
comes subversive 
when it explores 
and reveals the ugly 
secrets of the suue," 

Accord ing to 
Gord i mer. "South 
African wriler.

tions [for the abol-
ishment of apart-
heidi long before 
the transil ion came 
10 light. They 
showed hidden 
feelings of human 
warmth between 
people of di fferent races," which were surpressed because 
of apartheid laws. 

Gordimer, who was born and raised in Johannesburg, 
said she was aware of the injustices of apartheid even as a 
child 

She knew when she was very young that she did not 
share the opinions of her fellow white South Africans. 

She explained that she spent a lot of time at the local 
library with what sheconsiders her real writing teachers-
books. Since libraries were segregated., she says, "had I 
been born black, I would never have been a writer. to

Her early revelations led Gordirner 10 wrile aboul 
apanheid and the Lives of both the while and black South 
Africans that it affected. 

During the 19505 she was involved in a political group 
of South African artists opposed to legalized racism, an 
acti vity that ws not only illegal, but very dangerous. Many 
of her colleagues. notjUSl blacks. bul whites. indians. and 
lhose of mixed backgrounds, were imprisoned for lheir 
anti-apw1heid SlanCeS. 

Gordimer will continue to write about South Africans, 

"It w_ the wrtt .... 
and It w_ In the 
theatre that people 

wer~abIe to act out 
their frustrations, 
and their anger with 
one anotll., and 
W .... able to show 
how, tIwough their 
... _.tty, people 
could Ive together" 

-NadIne Gorclmer 

even though apart-
heid has been 
largely abolished. 
She says Ihe 
changedesegrega-
tion bting "ha, 10

imagination. So I 
don 'tlhink that ei-
ther! orolher wril-
ers in South Africa 
are. so to ' peak. up 
to date with lhe 
changes. lllat will 
come laler. with 
time." 

Ultimately. 
Gordimerdoes not 

feel that writers have much influence at the government 
level anywhere in the modem world. 

However, she believes that wrilersdid contri bu Ie 10 the 
elimination of apartheid. 

" It was the writers and it was in the theater that people 
were able to act out their frustrations and their anger with 
one another. and were able to show how, through their 
humanity, people could live together," she said 

Nadine Gordimer' s latest novels and short story collee-
lions are available at the Central Library and the UCSD 
Bookstore. 

UC ~ - The A.S. received what is expected to be the final version of 
the UC budget on Monday, the regents will most likely vote to approve the 
President's recommendations at a meeting today. The recommended 
budget calls for merit.oased salary increases for faculty, as well as a 
retroactive measure that would provide for the payment of faculty merit 
increases that were not funded last year. The University of California 
Student Association (UCSA) opposes those increases, as well as the mid-
year fee increase and the $70 million loan that the preSident'S offICe may 
take out to defer that increase. 

L~lIIItion - Govemor Pete Wilson has vetoed almost all of the bills that 
have reached his desk from the UCSA and other student organizations. As 
a reSUlt, the state legislature went into special session last Thursday and 
Friday In an attempt to override several of the governor's vetoes. A large 
Democrat-sponsored rally on the steps of the Capitol was not influential 
enough. however, to push through SB 1533. a bill that would have cut the 
state bureaucracy to restore funding to financial aid programs. The bill failed 
to find an author and consequently remained tabled . 

UClA FandnC - Vice President Colin Wilson brought up the pending issue 
of UCSA funding. The separate universities within the UC system have not 
been contributing the same perÂ·student fee to support the efforts of the 
UCSA, the main UC student lobbying association. UCSD led funding with a 
$1.50 per student contribution, while UC Berkeley was at the bottom with 
88 cents per student.

In this special opinion section, representatives from the C<XlpS and the administration explain their respective positions on the current co-op 
controversy. The explanations are responses to questions asked by the Guardian editorial board - Editor in Chief Ben Boychuk, 

Managing Editor Eric Schmidt, News Editor Francisco DeVries and Opinion Editor Philip Michaels. With the exception of some bracketed clarifications,

6. Whether or 1101 the A.S. is independent, the answer is 
definitely yes.

because it would require the c<Hlps to be accountable to all 
UCSD tudents (through their elected repre.<entatives).

I. The root of lhe problem has 
twO stems: money and control. 

ll1e co-op are expanding and 
redirecting revenue to students 

which would otherwise end up in the regent' bank 
account. Thi s is p"rticularly so with regard to textbooks 
and s upplie~, which gener.llt! otherwise guaranteed 
revenue for the regent, through their on-canlpus book-
,tore. With the budget cri:.b deepening, the administration 

~irnply doe, not want to sell it s products in a competitive 
marl..et. The control side is intimately related to the money 
side. It is becau~e the co-ops are student-run enterprises 
autonomous of the administration that they have been able 
to expand their sale~ and ervices to an annual tumover of 
$2.500.000. It is also because of autonomy that the co-ops 
have been able to legally defend themsel ves against 
monopolistic take-over to the tune of $70,000. THE 
ROOT OF THE PROBLEM, IN SHORT, IS THAT THE 
ADM INISTRA TIO WANTS TO MAXIMIZE THE 
PROFITS IT CAN MAKE FROM S11.JDENTS, A 
MAJOR OBSTACLE TO WHICH ARE EXPANDING 
STUDENT ENTERPRISES. But we also suspect political 
motives. The administmtion does not want a working 
e ample of an alternative 10 their own hierarchical mode 
of organization on campus. 

2. Because we are student-run organizations. we value 
greatly the concept of students wor1cing for the benefit of 
tudent ,and students working, learning and creating 

together in an environment free from the dictales of others.

I. ~ issue is whether or not the propeny (meaning the 

assets) belongs to the university or the co-ops. The 
university has thought all these years that it belonged to 
the students. The co-ops thought it belonged to them. 
Because the university thought it belonged to the students. 
it gave a lot of breaks to the co-ops. 

But if this is not the case. there's no way the university 
should provide benefils or Â·ub. idize the co-op ... there are 
other complicated legal issues .. , the agreements I between 
the Universi ty Center Board (UCB) and the co-ops] were

the UCB is adviso')' . 

Our position is that the agreements are not valid ... the 
co-ops are invitees. It's like when someone is a guest at

Lauren Padilla 
Representative, Food Co-op 

I. Basically, the aclministrJtion fails to rec-
ognize that the tudents of UCSO have the 
ability, determination and integrity to foster 

responsiblestudentorganiz.atioo;and~inesses, 
which serve the students of this campus. It is 

apparent just by noting the relationship between the co-ops and admini~Â· 
trJtion that the administration has become even more hostile, especially 
now with the pending eviction. 'The administration continues to claim its 
pursuirfor"student interests," but in reality it does not wam to acknowledge 
student businesses as opposed to UC-controlled businesses. 

What is even more distressing is the administration's refusal to work 
lI'irh the co-ops, not against them. The C<HlpS have agreed to many 
specifications, such as the issue ofliability. Within reasonable limits the co-
ops want to settle. We see it as the only way to settle disputes. 

On the other hand we will not be bought by them or give in to 
unreasonable demands such as giving them a "cut" of our sales. We are 
students, not students for administrative endeavor!>. The administmtion 
needs to a!so acknowledge thai they are trying to putdowntheirown student 
body; an exhaustive process thi has been; yet we feel strongly about our 
existence here at UCSD, as we make up a part of it. 

2. The c<HlpS are made up of mostly students: (presently all members 
are UCSD students <II the Food C(H)p) therefore it is only logical we be 
granted student organization tatus. It is self-evident we are here to offer 

See FOOD, Page 9 

ITom Tucker 
Assistant Vice Chancellor 
for Undergraduate Affairs 

1. The origin of the controver.;y is the 
issue of co-op SlaIUS. Under the current ar-
rangement, the uni versity must assume li -

ability and accountability for operations of the co-op, without oppor-
tunity for proper oversight. Situation such as a food poisoning 
incident at the Food Co-op. an injury to an underage patron at aChe 
Cafe event, violation of Internal Revenue Service regulations, and a 
recent Workers Compensation claim place the university in an unac-
ceptable position of liability without adequate oversight. 

On the accountability side, the recent audits have pointed out the 
absence of adequate record , lack of ound financial pmctice. loans to 
employees, deci ion making by non- tudents and violation of Internal 
Revenue Service regulations. 

2. Student organization status forretail operations is the basic issue. 
We register approximately 250 campus student organizations. Regis-
tration as a student organization should not be connected to authoriza-
tion to operate a retail establishment on the UCSD campus. Retail 
agreements shall be separate, protect the university and be in the best 
interest of all UCSD students. 

J, I think retail operations, managed by students, with sound 
financial practice. proper protection of the university from a liability 
standpoint and adequate peer oversight. are significant to UCSD 
campus life and very important to our campus. I have stated over and 
over again Ihal if the co-ops refuse 10 meet these cri teria, other studenl, 
not commercial operation , hould be assigned spaces currently occu-
pied by the co-ops. Sludent leaders would be asked 10 e tabli sh 
guidelines for this replacement process. 

See TUCKER, Page 7 

Che Cafe 
Collective 

I. The root of the controversy bctween th~ 
coÂ·op and the admini~t ration is that ouroverJII 
goals theoretically do nor coincide with one 
another. The administration's goal, are obviÂ· 

ously for the profit of the schools. The process involves a particular 
hierarchy utilizing bureaucrJIic controls. The co-ops concentrate on the 
use of consensus decision.making and collectivity. Obviously an eco-
nom ic reality exists, but they attempt to give the students ahematives to 
the one provided by the university administrJtion. The root of this 
particular problem happens to be over student control of ~tudent fee-
funded facilities. 

2. Student organization status is important because without it. why 
would the administration allow aco-opacting as a "vendor" to ",lyon thi .. 
campus, especially if it wa n't significantly increasing the universi ty's 
monetary profit? Why would the administration want "alternative" 
competition? Without student organization status they can eliminate u~ . 

3, The co-ops are important notju t because they are alternative (in 
theory and in the products they offer) , but because they are a social 
education. It may be hell to go through collective or consensus decision-
making, but it i also empowering for every individual involved. The 
ideals are,culturally, acompletely different way of dealing with business; 
teaching awareness of actions as well as social biases. 

See CHE, Page 7 

General Store 
Co-op 

1. ECONOMIC: The continuing budget cri-
sis is leading campus administmtors to view 
srudent businesses as additional sources of rev-
enue. The contract vendors in Ihe "High" Price 

Center pay rents which are tied to their gross revenues; thus, competilion 
from the co-ops reduces the administration's ability to extract profits 
from the students, 

POLITICAL: UCSD was created, in large part, to suppl y technology 
and technicians tothe military and its private-sector subcontractors in the 
San Diego area. Since UCSD students have a long history of disputing the 
administrntion's view of UCSO's proper role in our society, the admin-
istration is constantly struggling to balance its need to maintain a liberal, 
open-campus atmosphere, attractive to the best scientists, with its need to 
teach discipline and maintain security on behalf of irs military. and 
corporate clientele. 

The co-ops provide UCSD students with the economic and polit ical 
means to develop and assert their own vision of ociety, in conflict wi th 
that ofUCSO's rulers. The administration's need to maintain at least the 
appearance of a democratic campus explains the fact that the co-ops have 
not yet been wiped out. 

2. Student organization status is imponant to the co-ops largely 
because of what it implies: that people have the legal and moral right, on 
or off campus, to organize themselves for their own mutual benefit, 
Presently, any four students can come together and fonn a registered 
tudent organization. The co-ops are prepared to defend this right. for 

themselves or for any and all other student group .

affordable and to educate students on how to run a successfu I business in

OPINION 5 

So What 
Happens 
Now? 
At present, there are three possible 
outcomes to the dispute between 
the coops and the administration. 

Possibility #1: The current negotiaÂ· 
tions between the adm inistration, the 
CO<>ps, the Associated Students 
(A.S.) and a slew of lawyers fail and 
the administration proceeds with the 
eviction process. 

In this case, the courts could rule 
that the co<>p leases expire on Oct. 
31, 1992. However, there is also the 
possibility that a judge might decide 
th leases expire on Oct. 31, 1993, 
Ie lVlng open the possibility for further 
negotiations. 

Possibility #2: The negotiations 
fail. but the co<>ps agree to the 
administration's previous demands. 
The co<>ps would agree to keep all 

accounts on-campus, and the 
administration would be able to 
intervene in the operation of the co-
ops. In this situation, the co<>ps 
would be recognized as outside 
vendors, with their lease agreements 
coming up for renewal every few 
years. At that time, any outside 
business could apply tor the space, 
with the possibility of outbidding the 
co<>ps. 

Possibility #3: The negotiations 
succeed with the current proposal -
the A.S. takes liability for the ac-
counting and bookkeeping proce-
dures, while the co<>ps assume 
liability for insuring the safety of their 
patrons. 

The Food Co<>p, for example, has 
already agreed to a $3 million 
insurance policy to cover this liability. 
The other co<>ps have similar 
arrangements, The agreement also 
recognizes the co<>ps as student 
organizations and allows them to 
have off-campus accounts. Mean-
while, the A.S. and the administration 
will work towards granting the A.S.

I A. S.I Pres ident rMike J Holmes. dated 
Oct. 9. 1992 best represents my re-

Dear President Holmes: 

On the front page of the Thursday.

Also, the campus ' other"vendors" 
and businesse; do not provide the 
same information at comparable 
prices. 

4. There is definitely antagonism 
between the co-ops and the adminis-
tration. How can there not be when 
we know that their ultimate goal is the 
elimination of our existence? We are 
not pan of their agenda. This defi -
nitely interferes with negotiations 
beeause there is a precedence of the 
administration going back on their 
word to achieve this agenda. It is 
difficu ltto beopen-mincled whendeal-
ing with a group that has blatantly 
been aggre ive and con tantly at-
tempts to crew us over in the ftrst 
place. 

s. The resolving of the situation is 
mass student empowerment. 

There needs to be unity among 
tudents so that they can politically 

take charge of the administration ' 
actions and economically take charge 
of where their money is being allo-
cated. 

Read the G...,.., .. . 
You'll be the better for It. 

"Students run. manage and suppon 
the faci lities, yet are being threatened 
wilh the loss of control. Â·' Stephaan 
Harris. GIIIJrlliall reponer. also indi -
cates that you said that the'Â· .S. has 
a duty to protect the co-op' from the 
loss of internal ontrol." 

Your !>Iatements and earlier me. -
sages contained in yo ur "Open Letter 
tothe Univers ity of California." dated 
June 19. 1992. are clear. The admin-
istration should not assume any over-
sight responsibility for co-op retail 
operations. Such re ponsibilities 
should be left to the ASUCSD. Al-
though we have attempted to w rk 
close ly with you to seek resolutions 
that are in the best interests of all 
studem . yourstatement in the Guard-
ian accuses the administration of in-
appropriate effon to control the co-
ops. 

Because Ihe adminbtration doe. 
believe that the ASUCSD should rep-
resent the interest of all students. I am 
writing to propo e that AS CSD as-

leges and rights; namely I) Ihe right to 
hire an attorney to sue Ihe regents. 2)

all aspects of the co-ops (General

protect the welfare and 100 after the 
best interesl of UCSD students. All

by the ASUCSD Council. staling that 
the coÂ·ops are operating in Ihe best

The Naval ROTC progmm offers

ROTC ~tudenlS take cla'iSCS on

Currently there is a "university-

wide policy thai rudent~ be pennined 
10 panicipale in [ROTC] progrnms." 
said Smith. UC Santa Barbam and UC 
Berkeley both have ROTC progrnm~ 
on their campuses. 

According 10 Smith, if a student 
peritions 10 take ROfC,theCEPwould 
work to c.J1ange UC policy on ROTC. 

Irons said that he wi ll also petition 
10 have the y tern wide policy 
amended. 

"CEP would support a change in 
the relevant UC ystem-wide policy if 
need be," state the m inules from the 
meeting.

..em e~ 10 [he srudents. The co-op'~ 
ob~ti \ es are fOr the members to beÂ· 
l ,)In' ro.ponsible citizens of the comÂ· 
munlly.notonly while weare at UCSD. 
bul when we leave it. 

We had a core memben~ho u!>Cd 10 
be a ~udent and because of the fee 
increases of '9 1-'92 WID. nO! able 10 
ontinue at UCSD. He was [al] the very 
Iea.~ a m~ valuable member of the 0-
op. We were not going 10 lei our co-
worker go because he could no longer 
be a student. Instead we colleclivel~ 
decided he should still \,ark with us. 

This i the spirit of our collecti ve:,; 
unfOl1Unately, the adminiSlr.ltion will 
says it's a matter ofliability. They know 
very weU the co-ops have agreed to 
providlngliabilityandworkman'scomÂ· 
pensation at their cost. In conclusion. 
lhe students come frrst for the co-ops. 
[andl it i only narural that studentÂ·run 
businesses on campus, serving the cam-
pus. be given their rightful student sta-
tu . To deny it would be OUtrighl abuse 
on the adminisuation 's part. 

3_ The co-ops have become a place 
for the student community to not only 
purchase books, supplies and food prod-
ucts, but la place where students] are 
also invited lobecomeaclively involved 
in the cooporatives. Students not only 
havetheopportunitytoexpenencework-
ing collectively but also can become 
more aware on a variety of lopic~ in-
cluding the environment to pol ilical i~Â­
sues. This experience i valuable when 
working outside of UCSD, as it only 
serves to strengthen our other kills. 

4. To say that a hostile relationship 
does not exist would be lying. Thre:uen-
ing to close [the] co-ops, such as in 
December and January . only serves as a 
remlnderofthe administration's pursuit 
of ridding the co-ops [from the] cam-
pus.In the very least, it should be stated 
that thoughtful dialogue is more pro-
ductive than senseless physical force. 

5_ Communication and a willing-
ness for the administration 10 realize 
that. indeed. student-run businesses and 
organizations such as the co-ops can 
and should exist for the students. If 
action is not taken now by the commu-
nity of UCSD to voice concerns and if 
the administration is unwilling to hear, 
the co-ops will be a once-was.

be autonomous. We've always 
thought the property belongs to stu-
dents as a whole. That 's why we've 
been providing insurance. We can 'I 
do that when non-students are in-

side believes Ihey are enlirely cor-

questioll. 

6, Legally, it could be done. But 
in order for it to happen, the A.S. 
would have to assume liability and

WaMn ha~ claimed complelo! signaÂ· 
tory power over Ihi~ stucknt selfÂ·imÂ· 
posed fee. Concerning the hio,(ory of 
whal is now called Ihe Universiry CenÂ· 
ter fee . the regenls item dilled Sept 18, 
1969 states: 

In I 968. the San DiegoStudentCen. 
ter Comm ihee, an advisory body to the 
Associated SlIIdents. urged that a refer-
endum be held on the campus in which 
gmduale and undergraduate students 
would v(){e on a selfÂ· imposed fee 10 
finance the construction of the first of 
Ihree proposed Ciulller Studem Centers. 
The referendum, ~ponsored by the 
ASUCSD as part of campus general 
elections, was held during the week of 
May 5-9, 1969, at which time the stu-
dents v(){ed 10 assess lhemselves. begin-
ning in the Fall Quarter of 1969, a 
special fee. nO! to exceed $6 per quaner 
to be utilized exclusively for the conÂ· 
~lruction and operJlion of one or more 
Student Centers or Student Unions at 
the San Diego campus. 

In 1972. the regents declared that all 
assets of lhe Associaled Students on 
"several campuses of the University" 
were under regent.11 control. and il de-
clared them to be official units of the 

unive~iry . 1be Associated Students aI 
UCLA and Berkeley balked. Both were 
declared exempt from this item, panly 
due to lhe fact Ihat they had the financial 
ability 10 fight it. 

If anyresoluliOllregardingautonomy 
is made, it should be made by acoolilicn 
of studenl organizations and student 
governance boards that can be repre. 
sented by independent legal council to 
clarify cOI1IrOI over our fees.

for PirJIe.<. fans loday. ot only do they

The Wor.;! pan about Pilt'iburgh' s 
heanbreaking loss in the playoffs i~n't the 
fac t that they played brilliantly for eiglu

hero in the booom of the nimh. o. the

at lea,t two more games this fall.

newest exer.:ise video will probabl v be 
' ''The Tomahawk Workout:' retailing for 
$39.95. Hey lall('. do ou know where 
you and Ted can bury that halchet'! 

And wha!", UP wllh that annoying 
war cbant? How about trying something 
original. in~lead of stealing from Florida 
State? Brave,<, fans were a lot less 
obnoxious when their team was 
languishing in the bru.emenL Ah, che 
good old day~. 

All I've been hearing lately is the 
lanlents of the poor Bay Area fans. Snap 
out of it ! At least the A's didn 't lose in 
the bottom of the ninth. Listen, NorCal 
failhful: The A's have won four 
divisional titles, three American League 
pennants. and one World Series title in 
the last five seasons. 1be Niners. even 
without Montana, are having another 
excellent ear. Th Wanio~ are one or 
the mo~t exciting and competitive h:am~ 
in the BA. Â·"The Genius" ha . ., Stanford 
among the nation's elite, and the Golden 
Bears aren't 100 shabby, eicher. 

But the best pan aboul being a B,I~ 
Are<1 fan is knowing that Ihe Giants 
might be moving to Florida. Talk about 
being spoiled! How could you ask for 
lmything more? 

At least you Bay Area fans don'l live 
in eattle. The Manne~ are the model of 
futility. Here's an idea of how palheuc 
the Mariners re:tlly are: In 1991, the M's 
win 83 gam.:s, their fir..t winning season 
ever. To remedy the ituation, they fire 
the manager. Hoping to relum to their 
losing ways. they trade for Kevin 
Mitchell. The maneuvers worked: Seattle 
returned (0 the (.'Cliar in only one !.eUl.Of\! 

The Marinen. pattemed their sucCes.!> 
after the achievement~ of another ~terling 
franchi-.e. the Cleveland Indians. The 
Tribe hasn't been to the World Series in 
nearly 40 yean.. They haven'l finished 
higher than fourth ~ince divisional play 
tarted in 1969. They're almOSI as bad as 

the Cubs and the White Sox. 
And being a San Diego fan isn'l so 

easy, pither. The Padres have tasted 
postseason glory only once in 24 seasons. 
1be Cllargers haven'l been to the 
playoffs in a decade. The Oippers 
moved in 1984. And the city' s besI team, 
the Sockers, don't even have a league to 
play in anymore. 

So cheer up, Bay Area fans. Getting 
10 the playoffs and losing is bener than 
not getting there at all. Just ask a 
Mariners fan.

Eagles Soar Past Tritons 
WOMEN'S VOLLEYBAU.: UCSD 
inconsi ten~ loses to Division n Cal 
tate Los Angeles 

By Julie Sherman 
Staff Writer 

At least the women's volleyball leam is con.~isÂ­
lenl. "The only Ihing we're consistent about is our 
incofuiMency," sruda visibly disappointed womcn 's 
volleyball coach Doug Dannevik, who had expecled 
his temn 10 play at a much higher level I han they did 
laM night III a 15Â·5,15-10.15-13 1m .. , to Cal Slate Los 
Angeles. 

Dannevik envisioned the~une Iype of high intenÂ· 
sity. tough play that he!.aw in hi<. team when il played 
Cal Scate Bakelbfield Sal urday night. That game was 
a Irn.s on the !tCoreboard bur still a victory in tenn of 
overall performance. 

What he got wa;, tentative play, mo~t apparent in 
game one. The Golden Eagles went OUllO a 5Â·0 lead, 
and the Tnton~ 1"K1 a lot of trouble convening their 
side-out.;, to poinll.. 

Dannevik had trouble understanding why, conÂ· 
sidering his team's play chis weekend. 

"We deserved to corne out better like we did 
against [Bakersfield]. We have to be lougher more of 
Ihe time," he said 

The end of game two showed more of the type of 
play Dannevik had hoped 10 see throughout the 
malch. 

It didn't start out that way, however, as the Tritons 
continued committing errors aI crucial turning points 
of the game. The team would make a flawless play to 
get the side-out, but service and ballÂ·handling errors 
kept the Tritons from converting their IOUgh play into 
points. 

Dan McDowell/Guardian 
Laura Kranz couldn't lead UCSD to victory 

After taking a lime-out, UCSD brought the !tCOI1! 
to 5Â·3. when yet another service error gave Cal Scale 
Los Angeles the serve. 

At 11 Â·3. Golden Eagles leading. it looked agJin 
as if the Tritons were not playing to the level aI which 
they are capable. 

But, jusl when they looked their worsl. the TriÂ· 
tons increased their intensity and showed some 
flashes of mental toughness thai made the game 
close. 

Megan Lucas started off wilh a service ace, one 
of her two in the match. Powerful kills from 4um 
KranzandJulie Harvey (who had nineand eightl$ills 
in the match, respectively) spruted the Tritons to

Then a controversial out-<>f-bounds

Lucas served yet another ace to keep the

Public Eye: Pesci 's wisecracking 
energy is not enough to save this one 
By Rona Kelly 
Guardian Reporter 

Actor Joe Pesci tries to carry Tlte Pltblic 
Eye. but hi s wise-cracking energy is not 
enough to avethi one. Pesci stars as the 
lovable Leon "Bemzy" Bemstein. a 
freelance photographer on the streets of 

ew York. circa 1942. 
1lle movie was inspired by an exhibit of 

tabloid photogmphy from the era. The 
exhibit, which was showing at New York's 
Intemat ional Center of Photography. 
impre sed writer-<lirector Howard Franklin 
enough that he decided to create Tlte Public 
Eye. 

TIle tabloid photographers that are the 
focus of the film were called "shutterbugs" 
due to the nature of their work. the hours 
they kept and the places they frequented. 

Bemzy. dubbed "The Great Bemzini" 
for his uncanny knack of aniving tirst on 
the scene of a crime, is actually ba~ed on a 
shutterbug named Weegee. Be ause of hi 
investigatiye ski lls, he tinds himself 
involved III clande tine activities. 

The plot entwine Bemzy with nigtuclub 
owner Kay Levitz (Barbara Hershey). 
Levitz asks Bernzy for a personal favor that 
will eventually lead to scandal and murder. 
She wants him to inYestigale a mobster who 

wishes to have a share of the profits from 
her nightclub. 

Bemzy. an emotionally isolated loner. 
falls for the seemingly unattainable Levitz. 
and follows through with the favor. blinded 
by love. He also feels that by carrying out 
Levitz's wish. he will obtain material which 
will help his book selL 

Bernzy believes deeply in his an and 
devotes hi life to it. Unfonunately. this 
ponion of the plot remains incredibly 
underdeveloped bec;tuse the internal 
connicts Bemzy grapples wi th are never 
re,olved. TIle mo ie mi,es issues about the 
nature of an. but doesn't develop them. 

Although The Public Eye is a stylisti-
cally impressive movie. and Joe Pesci puts 
out a compelling ano hean-warming 
perfornlance. the storyline b weak and the 
issue, are never confronteO. The "Beauty 
and lhe Beast" formula (,1 hackneyed theme 
in Hollywood prodUCti ons) that develops 
between Levitz and Bemzy never pans out. 

III.\TU .3 

and Bemzy's problems are only panially 
so lved at the close of the film. 

Unle . you are a die-hard Joe Pcsl:i fan 
or feel that you have money buming a hole 
in your pocket. wait until this one comes 
ou! on video. 

The Public Eyr opens tomorrow at 
theaters throughout San Diego.

Swoon: Kalin's fIlm is yet another rendition of 
Leopold and Loeb murder case from the 1920s 
By Yazmln Ghonalm 
Guardian Reporter 

What would you do with a chisel. 20 feet of rope. a 
typewriter and a 13 year-old boy? In Tom Kalin 's SWOOII. 
this is the situation two Jewish intellectuals find themselve~ 
in, and the film goes beyond the crime to analyze the 
characters themselves. 

The movie takes place in Chicago in the 1920s, at the 
end of World War I. The charucters are surrounded by the 
booming industries. culture and all that jazz. But the movie 
is not simply a period piece; it shows how two real 
characters made an impact on American history. 

While "angel face Leopold" and "mastennind Loeb" 
chiseled their names into fame, director Kalin eroticize. the 
couple's crime with police investigators' innuendoes of 
homosexuality in the '205. However. Kalin states thut this 
film "ltrie Ito work against heroizing or villianizing the 
characters." Leopold's love for Loeb becomes known. and 
Loeb become a famous criminal. The film i successful 
because it shows that the chara ters are very human.

RECORD REVIEWS 
Women Sound Off: New albums reflect recent political changes 
ByJeffN ..... 
Hiatus Editor 

1l1e fierce battle between three 
major presidential candidates i 
~haking up politic this election 
year. but the pre idency i not the 
only political battle being waged. 
Women are fighting for a place in 
government in greater numbers 
than ever before. l1le strides 
women are taking in pol itic are 
al'lO evident within popular 
cultu re. From "Murphy Brown" to 
Madonna. women are assert ing 
thei r independence. 

Within the realm of popular 
music alone. the year ha seen 
many stirring releases. Groups 
like L7 and Hole have released 
grunge rock albums which ri val 
the relea..es of Nirvana and Pearl 
Jam. The rap group TLC h~ 

~cored a Top Ten hit . and 
Madonna has an album/bOOk/ 
video in the works which is 
already Cfl U ing a tiro Recent 
rclea!>es by uzanne Vega. Sinead 
O'Connor and PJ. Ilarvey all deal 

with crucial women 's issues 
and provide more in ight 
into the way attitudes about 
women are changing. 

Suzanne Vega 
99.9F 
A&M Records 

On 99.9 F it sounds like 
Suzanne Vega was i n~pi red 
by the group DNA's remix 
of her ,ong "Tom', Diner." 
While most arti st~ are fil ing 
law ~uit!> and claiming their 
creati vi ty i being sapped by 
sampling, Vega was so 
pleased with the way DNA 
put a hip-hop beat behind her 
coffee-house ditty. she put 
out Wl entire album of 
version of "Tom' Diner." 

The best songs on 99.9 F are 
the experimental ne. "Blood 
Make Noise," a song about a 
patient (perhap:. :.uffering from 
AIDS) who hill trouble compre-
hending the impact of a doctor 's

diagno is. is pos ibly one of 
the best ingles of the year. 
Other songs. like the title-
track. deal with sickness as 
well. The camiÂ¥alesque beat 
on "Monkey in the Middle" 
sounds almost like a Tom 
Waits' track in the way it 
incorporates quirky rflythms. 

Vega has a knack for 
penning highly literate and 
provocative lyrics. With the 
new mu ical direction of 99.9 
F. she shows she is no folkie 
bum-out. The farther left-of-
center Vega moves. the better 
she becomes. 

PJ Harvey 
Dry 
Indigo Records 

PJ Harvey ' Dry is being 
hailed as one of the brightest 
debut of the year. TIle band plays 
a very slow, but intense form of 
hard folk, much like what Kendm 
Smith did with Opal 's album 

Happy NiRhlmare Baby in 1987. 
Harvey is the lead singer and also 
play guitar and a wicked violin. 

On the first song. "Oh My 
Lover," he establishes some of 
the dichotomies of the album. TIle 
song is about a mblOge a Irois in 
which he urge her loverto love 
both her and Mother companion. , 

1be music on this album has an , 
erotic feel to it , and yet, on the 
song "Sheela-Na-Gig." Harvey 
makes it clear she isn' t going to 
obse over any male. She sings, I 
"I'm going to wash that man right , 
out of my hairlI ' ve heard it before I 
and no more/Going to take my 
hips to a man who cares. " 

Sinead O 'Connor 
Am I Not Your Girl? 
Chrysalis Records 

While this is the most tame 
album the shaved-headed Irish 
singer has released. it doesn't 
mean he has 10 t her ability to irk .

Salllrday Night Live . ~he per-

was clear and very appealing. 
Add to it her arresting stage 
presence and vibrant music, and 
he had the crowd captivated. 

As the day progressed, more 
and more people staned flocking 
in and by the end of the evening 
there was a sizeable crowd. 

The crowd lent the concert 
color and atmosphere and 
comprised an interesting 
assortment of people from all age 
groups. 

People dressed in a variety of 
colors. l1le hard-core reggae fans 
wore beads. One man wore black 
jeans, a red shirt and a yellow 
wortman's helmet. Another man 
was throwing his child in the air 
in time to the music. These 
people gave the concert charac-
ter. 

What also made the crowd 
different from a typical audi-
ences was the absence of the 
violent energy which is usually 
present in many concert crowds. 
Even the people dancing made 
minimal use of bodily move-
ments. 

with special guest 

1bey were swaying rather 
than dancing. There were people 
strolling around, people lying on 
the grass, people swaying and 
people chatting with each other. 
It was all casual, peaceful 
entertainment.

Toward the end. however, the 
crowd staned swelling in number 
and the dancing space was 
packed. By the time Foundation 
and Donovan made their 
appearances, the crowd was 
charged up. 

The music performed by 
Foundation was a fre h approach 
to the harmony trio. 

Donovan played to a very 
appreciative crowd and a lot of 
people were dancing by the time 
he finished. 

Thursday, October 15, 1992 

SINEAD: Not 
much drama on 
her new release 
ContInued from pa&e H6 
formed Bob Marley's "War" Ii 
capella Wld then announced that 
we need to fight the " real enemy." 
She proceeded to hold up a photo 
of the Pope and tear it to shreds. 

Unfortunately, there' nothing 
as dramatic on "Am I Not Your 
Girl?" The title-track is the best 
song on the album because it 
recounts the way succe s has been 
difficult for her. This song is the 
only one that has the same 
haunting feel as some of the track 
on her first album. "The Lion and 
theCobm." 

Although O'Connor's anempt 
at singing torch ballads has not 
been well received by the pres. 
But even though the album is a bit 
boring, she has the vocals to ju t 
about pull it off. She is backed by 
a 4O-piece orchestra on the album. 
Even though Lhey don't have 
much energy, ongs like "Black 
Coffee" and "Why Don't You Do 
Right?" have a lush, subdued feel 
to them.
