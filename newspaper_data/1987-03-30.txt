SACRAMENTO, UC \\f,re - A bill to end the last obstacle to 

complenng numerous University of Cali forma buildings has been 
Signed into law by Gov. George DeukmeJian. 

Assembly Bill 55, by Assembly Speaker Pro Tempore Mike Roos 
was rushed through the legislature and to the governor's desk in 
order to end an aCCidental higher education onstruction freeze 
resulting from the passage of the federal Tax Reform Act of 1986. 

The bill, along with AB 350, a second and slmilarbill by Roos that 
is expected to be soon signed into law, will speed construction of 
pro le l' t ~ LOtallll1g ';86 .4 mill ion. 

AVOiding major delays 111 UCs capital constru tion program is 
"crill cal:' said Roos , D-Los Angeles, because "such delays can 
increase project costS due to in natlon and increase program COStS 
due to continued usc of inadequ<lte faci ll tie ." 

"The university is laced with tlccomodatlng the II1creased 
enrollments th at It has experiencec.lln recenl years and the further 

in c rl',ISC~ 111 enrollment thaI arc projected in future years:' Arultll

Football misinfonnation 

Editor: 
There have been a number of 

letters (Ibout uc D T nton Football 
publIshed in your letters section. 
whether completely factual or not. 
It seems that the strongest 
opposition to the establishment of 
a football team at UC D are the 
mISinformed. The letters have 
ranged from pure paranOia to 
<l cusation that the club is made 
up of glory hungry football players. 
As Chairman of AS Ad-Hoc 
Football Committee I wish to dear 
the air on this misleading 
II1formation about football . 

There have been aG usations 
that if UC D were to field a team 
that It would be made up of (I 
bunch of Jocks whose onl), reason 
to go to UC D would be to play 
football ThiS I, slmpl)' not true. 
The academiC stand(lrds of UC D 
would not be altered to allow 
football pla}'ers to be admitted . Nor 
will any cholarships be given. If 
Stanford . UC Berkeley. Harvard 
and MIT can have football teams 
then so can UCSD. 

It has also been said that if 
UC D started a football team then 
all the other intercollegiate sports 
would suffer. This is comple tely

untrue . The football committee has 
worked step-by-step with Athletic 
Director Judy Sweet and 
Recreation Depanment Chari Bert 
KobayashI to prepare a student 
referendum so football would not 
adversely effect any of the exisnng 
intercollegiate spons programs. 
Actually. other sportS would 
benefit. as more fields. facilities. 
trainers and taff would become 
available because of football . As 
st udent interest rises in 
intercollegiate football it would 
ca rry over to all the other 
intercollegiate sports. It is clear to 
see that establishing a football team 
is the first step in promoting all 
intercollegiate athletics at UCSD. 

But all of thiS addresses JUSt 
football. Intercollegiate spons at 
UCSD are greatly underfunded . 

Just one example of this is how 
sludel1l-athletes are forced to pay 
for their equipment and travel 
costs. sometimes amounting to 
hund rcds of dollars. Th is is a great 
injustice to the intercollegiate 
athletes at UeSD. The referendum 
you will be voting on next week is 
not just for football but for all the 
other intercollegiate sports 
programs as well . 

If UC D is going to establish a 
football team and upgrade its 
intercollegiate athletiCS. it will be 
by a student vote in a referendum. 
Hence the decision lies With us. 
the students. Whichever way the 
UC D student forms his or her 
opinion on football. let it be an 
opiolllon based on facts. not false 
information .

5. IntercolleiPate Athletics 
UpKI'ade & Football Referendum 

The University of California, San 
Diego 's Intercollegiate Athletic 
Philosophy states that because of vast 
diversity of UCSD 's athletic program 
it IS unrealistic to suppose that 
adequate finances will ever be 
available to support all of the 
programs in their entirety. Because of 
this philosophy, many of the Inter-
collegiate athletes are forced to pay 
for their equipment and travel costs, 
sometimes amounting to hundreds of 
dollars. 

In addition, the administration of 
UCSD has determined that in order 
to establish an Intercollegiate Football 
Team at UCSD. a referendum must 
be passed by the students specifically 
stating an increase in student fees in 
order to finance the football program. 
As a result of this increase, all 
students will be admitted to home 
football games without admission 
charge. 

If passed, the funds generated by 
the referendum below will be used to 
upgrade UCSD's intercollegiate sports 
programs and to establish a Division 
III Football Program. 

Do you support an increase of 
$6.50 per quarter in the "Rec Facility 
Fee" effective Fall Quarter 1987, to 
be administered by the Director of 
Athletics on approval of the 
Intercollegiate Athletic Advisory 
Board to further finance the-.existing 
Intercollegiate Sports and establish a 
Division III Football Program? 
YES D NoD 

6. Coop referendum 
Do you approve of an increase in the 
current UniverSity Center Fee by 
$1.00 (one dollar) per quarter per 
student; locked in to s!Jeclfically pay 
for a Coop Administration Staff and 
to faci litate the expansion of existing 
on campus student-run cooperatives 
and the establishment of new UCSD 
student run cooperatives. 
YESD NoD

Phdlies co uld be very close 
conte nders of the Na tional League 
East. 

The St. Louis Cardinals . 1985's 
leaders, flilished under .500 at 79-
81. Bur that may have been a fluke . 
Yeah , the)' com bined for a measly 
.236 batting average (last 111 the 
lead) and a simple 58 homeruns. 
But thel r pitchrng may be the 
strongest in years. &htnd the anns 
of Joh n Tudor and the recovered 
Danny Cox, as well as the bats of 
Tommy Herr,Jack Clark, and , yes, 
Ozzie mith (.280 with 54 RBI's in 
1986) the Cardinals could prove to 
be very fonnidable and a team to 
wa tch out for. And let's not forget 
the speed of Vi nce Coleman and 
Willie McGee (If his legs arc 
better). 

The Chicago Cubsare still trying 
to regall1 the fo rm the)' had 111 
198-+ . But with sra ts like th o e last 
year, the trat! to recovery looks 
vcry, vel)' long. The pitching 
sulTered a combll1ed ERA of 4.-+ 9, 
last in the league, due In the mosr 
pan to tnJurie to their sta rting 
rotation from seasons past. Their 
bullpen was a savi ng grace, 
especially with Lee m ith 's J 1 
saves. The Cub~ can also fi nd 
power behind the bats of Jod y 
Davis, Leon Durham , Gary 
Matthews and now ex-Expo Andre 
Dawson . The larest rook ie 
sensation , Rafael Palmeiro, has 
gotten himsel f a place 111 the Cub 
outficld . If the pi tching improves 
and no onc runs away with the 
d iVision ea rl y. the Cubs wi ll pa k 
qUltt' a punch . But their chances of 
S!.'nous recolICl)' arc rea lly quite 
slim. 

The Pittsburgh Pimtes haven:t 
been the samc since their "Pops" 
targell and Willie McCovcy days. 

Now they re ly on ve teran To ny 
Pena, first bascman Johnny Ray 
and their own addition to the 
rookIe li st, Barry &mds. But 
playing against teams as solid a 
the Mets or Phtlhes wtth a 
struggling pitching staff does not 
place the Pirates chances very high 
th is year. 

Then there is the Montreal 
Expos . They art' in deep trouble 
thi s year. The)' Inst Dawson and 
their acc reliever Jeff Reardon has 
found hi s way to Minnesota. They 
have only nne starter worth 
mentioning: no),d Youmans. And 
the)' might be seci ng Rall1es in the

Volume 15, Number 1 Thursday, April 2, 1987 

What U2 fans have been looking for 

Being heralded by many as 
the greatest rock band since 
the Rolling Stones, U2 is 
bound to conjure up even 
more believers with their 
latest effort, "The Joshua 
Tree." With seven years and 
seven albums under their belt, 
the Irish quartet has grown 
from just a small underground 
band into the hottest group on 
both sides of the Atlantic. 

"The Joshua Tree," which 
made its debut on Billboard's 
Top 100 at the impressive 
spot of number seven, differs 
from the band's past efforts, 
revealing a group which has 
matured and no longer needs 
to rely on anthem-style songs 
to attract an audience. "The 
Unforgettable Fire" had 
"Pride (In the Name of 
Love)," "War" had "Sunday 
Bloody Sunday," and "Boy" 
had "I Will Follow;" all three 
are great singles and easy 
sloganeering anthems for the 
audience to understand and 
sing along with. 
. "The Joshua Tree" does 
not have that type of song. 
Filled with touches of blues 
,and country to accompany 
U2 's standard guitar-
oriented rxk, this album 
proves to be much more 

subtle in both its music and 
lyrics. The title of the album 
refers to the Joshua tree, the 
tree which, through religious 
beliefs, is said to possess 
branches that point to the 
Promised Land. But with such 
song titles as "i Still Haven't 
Found What I'm Looking 
For," it is as clear as the 
tangled up branches of the 
tree that the Promised Land 
will not be easy to find . 

Producers Brian Eno and 
Daniel Lanois, who worked 
on the last album, along with 

Steve Lilywhite, producer of 
the group's first three albums, 
make for a wide range of 
sound that is transfered into 
powerful and often dramatic 
music. The successful 
production is carried off 
primarily because of the 
precision guitar work by the 
Edge and a complex, solid 
beat thanks to drummer Larry 
Mullen Jr. and bassist Adam 
Clayton, The man really 
responsible for it all, though, 

by mark pinkus 

is lead singer and songwriter 
Bono Hewson. 

S~et the sin / bw bitrer the 
taste in my mouth / 1 see seum 
towers / but 1 only see one way 
oW / You got to cry without 
weeping / talk without speaking 
/ Scream without raising )'OUT 
voice , , " an excerpt from 
"Running to Stand Still," 
which deals with heroin 
addiction, exemplifies Bono's 
superior way of using words 
to create images. Bono has 
now proven he wants to do 
more than just rally an 

audience behind his single-
line sayings, but also wants to 
make people think about the 
world in which they live. 

While some songs deal with 
issues very personal to the 
band , "Red Hill Mining 
Town" explores the problems 
of British miners. It might 
seem unclear what an Irish 
rock star would know about 
mining, but the honesty in 
Bono's lyrics and vocals 
demonstrates his sympathy 

towards the issue. 
Other subjects covered 

throughout the II-song 
album are the beauty and evil 
of America, as depicted in 
"Trip Through the Wires" 
and "In God's Country," last 
year's tragic death of the 
band's manager in "One Tree 
Hill," and the disillusionment 
involved with personal and 
spiritual relationships as 
heard in "With or Without 
You" and "Bullet the Blue 
Sky." 

What has enhanced the 

reputation of this band the 
most is not the music or the 
lyrics but their live shows. 
Their most recent U ,S. 
appearance was last year for 
the six Amnesty International 
concerts. They stole the show 
from other greats as Sting and 
Peter Gabriel by reproducing 
their music with an intensity 
never before seen. 

The fact that the show was 
for Amnesty added 'to the 

' band's stron~ performance 

because of their ties with the 
organization, which is 
primarily concerned with the 
freeing of political prisoners. 
"The Joshua Tree" closes 
with " Mothers of the 
Disappeared," which deals 
with the abduction of children 
occurring in various 
countries. The song, along 
with the inclusion of the 
addresses to Amnesty, further 
prove the sincerity of the 
band. 

Appropriately, U2 's world 
tour, which begins tonight, 
starts in Arizona, a common 
place for the Joshua tree to 
grow. Bono has announced 
that the concerts will be 
longer than their past shows, 
which were already almost 
two hours. The band will be 
playing two sold-out shows 
here in San Diego next 
Monday and Tuesday, April 
13 and 14, followed by four 
more in Los Angeles . 
Listening to the new album 
will prove tha t U2 is the 
greatest recording rock band 
of the eighties, and after seeing 
them perform it will become 
obvious that the only thing 
the music business has to offer 
tha t is better than a U2 album 
is a U2 concert.

David Copperfield is 

someone that you really have 
to admire for his dedication to 
the thing he loves most -
magic. He is a world-
renowned illusionist and is 
currently in the midst of a six 
month-long tour that will 

finish up in June at the 
Pantages Theater in Los 
Angeles. 

How did he get to be so . 
famous . . . and what were his 
inspirations? 

The beginning of his career 
is an interesting story. His first 
interest in magic wasatthe age 
of ten when ventriloquists 
Paul Winchell and Jerry 
Mahney intrigued him. "They 
caught my eye," he said, and 
then support from his friends 
and family encouraged him as

Copperfield started by doing

"Platoon," which to date has 

grossed more than $100 
million. According to the 
commentators, dramaturge 
and Vietnam vet Oliver 
Stone's vision of American 
involvement in Southeast 
Asia was funded only after a

Installing

• • • Institution 
by rebecca jaurigue 

Unexpected. Experimental. 
Installation. 

Installation is an artist-
created , artist-managed space 
in San Diego which showcases 
works of art not usually seen 
in publi c museums or 
commercial galleries. The 
emerging success of this 
organization in the past few 
years reflects a favorable 

response to artistic expression 
that dares to disregard the 
limits of conventionality. 

This weekend, Installation 
hosts an opening reception for 
its new exhibition space 
downtown. Anyone inter-
ested in unique visual art is 
invited to view this inaugural 
exhibition titled "The 
Biennial. " 

Back in 1981, Installation 
started as an involvement with 
an evolving progressive art 
scene in San Diego. Major 
established galleries and ' 
museums had already set their 
concept of what "art" meant 
for their programs. So the 
work of unconventional local 
artists tended to be met with 

indifference by the estab-
lished programs. 

~nter Installation, set up 
cooperatively by local artists 
at its vis i o'n a r y and 
unpretentious beginnin!?s at a 
Fifth Avenue storefront, 
Installation has kept the 
commitment to presenting ~rt 
that might not otherwise be 
seen. Installation now works 
as a non-profit organization, 
with UCSD among its list of 
corporate sponsors. 

Through newsletters, 
benefits, workshops and 
various exhibitions, Installa-
tion interacts with both artist 
and audience in San Diego. 
The opening of "The 
Biennial" provides opportu-

Magic 
Continued from palle 3 
doors all over New York and 
finally found the opportunity 
to make a television special. 

Besides his family in New 
Jersey (where he grew up) he 
attributes his desire to create 
elaborate and memorable 
tricks to Fred Astaire and 
Gene Kelly because they did 
with dancing what he wants to 
do with magic; they were 

headliners because they didn't 
just dance, but added more . 

Copperfield doesn't want 
to just do tricks; he also wants 
to "touch" the 3udil'nce by 
going one step beyond . And 
that he does, which is obvious 
if you've ever seen him 
perform. 

His elaborate sets are the 
product of his collaboration 
with usually two or so other , 
usually the lighting designer 
and the scenic designer. It 
usually takes a year to 

conceive and develop his 
television specials. 

It was surpri ing to learn 
that opperfield and his 20 
rl'gulars tour for ten months 
of the year. He doesn't have a 
favorite phcwe to perform, 
becau e to him, hesays, "It'sa 
gift the audienc~ gives me to 
do the shows." He really 
enjoys performing, an 
obvious conc lusion after 
learning he docs 500 shows a 
year. 

Copperfield usually spends 

r------------· I 

two of his touring months in 
Los Angeles, workmg on his 
annual TV special~ and 
performing. Other than that 
he spends eight months ~lll 
ove r the United ' tates. 

omething new to him is that 
~ ~aM to tour Bmnl and 
London later this year and 
possibly Taipei in the fall. 

According to Copperfield, 
"Magic is my love, " and for as 
long as people will come see 
him perform, he' ll stay with it. 
Should the populanty of 

magic die, he sees a possible 
future in directing, since he 
al ready directs his TV 
specials. But for now 
Copperfield conti nues to sell 
out shows everywhere, and 
remains happy by giving his 
viewers more than just your 
average magic tricks . 

Editor's note: Lara Mihara 
didn't pull this information out 
of a hat, she actually interviewed

sequel continues to help put 
the fun back into the horror 
genre. 

For the benefit of those 
who by some unfortunate set 
of circumstances missed the 
first two films in the series, 
here is briefly what you 
missed. At first, the film 
seemed like it would be yet 
another movie in the "Friday 
the 13th" vein of cheap, 

explOitative, graphic horror 
movies, but it quickly rose 
above the insulting genre. 
Concisely put, "A Nightmare 
on Elm Street" was the best 
new horror film since 
"Halloween" 

The film revolved around a 
group of teenagers who were

assuming specific character, 
izations, being placed in the 
title role of a feature length 
film. Yet, in the relatively new 
film " Burglars" starring 
Whoopi Goldberg it is 
unfortunately tried again. 

In these cases, a film is 
basically used as a vehicle to 
ahowcase the talent of an 
individual comic, as well as 
uaing the name as a hopeful 
box,office draw. However, 
when the writing, supporting 
cast, and the star herself 
doesn't hold her own it comes 
very short of expectations. 

There are a handful of 
comics that some say have 
made the transition: Eddie 
Murphy, Steve Martin, and 
John Belushi. Yet, each had 
the they needed and 

film. In .. ..,~ ...... '-;o 
.... liIIiIii 

the writing is based on the 
rescue of "elephants," a firm 
technique used to move the 
plot along or get the main 
character out of hairy 
situations. 

Bob Goldthwait, who plays 
Goldberg's best friend Carl 
Heffler , is familiar to 
audiences due to his "Police 
Academy" roles. Gold· 
thwait's character although 
occasionally funny, seems to 
rely completely on his 
idiosynchratic grating voice. 

The film does have some 
redeeming qualities. Shot 
entirely in San Francisco, the 
film offers the viewer some 
spectacular views. The music, 
performed by a range of talent 
including Belinda Carlisle, 
The Jacksons and The 
Distance, is fun and upbeat. 
And when Goldberg does 
what she is best at, creating 
specific characters such as the 
old black cleaning lady, she is 
hilarious. However, all in all, 
don't let "Burglars" rob you 
of your hard-eamed movie 
money.

Freddy 
Continued from page 7 
burnt man in a ragged green 
and red sweater, who wore a 
glove of knives on his right 
hand, and tried to kill them. 
The catch of the film was that 
when the teenagers were killed 
in their sleep they never woke 
up. The fine line between 
dreams and reality had finally 
been crossed. 

The knived man was 
Freddy Krueger, played by 
little known actor Robert 
Englund, and his character 
quickly surpassed Jason as 
being horror fans' most loved 
psychotic, twisted killer. The 

real twist here being that 
Freddy's invincibility 
stemmed from the fact that he 
was dead from the start; 
burned alive many years 
before the picture took place 
by the parents of the children 
who he now terrorizes. 

The sequel, entitled 
"Freddy's Revenge," never 
took itself seriously, and was 
played more for laughs than 
for chills. The brilliance of the 
original remained (that you 
can't run away from your 
dreams, and therefore you 
can't run away from Freddy). 

"Dream Warriors" picks 
up largely where the first 
installment left off. The 

setting is a hospital ward for 
troubled teenagers. They all 
are having the same nightmare 
of a man who is trying to kill 
them, but the trouble is that 
none of the hospital staff 
believe the teens, nor do they 
see the coincidence that all the 
teens can describe that the 
same man to the color of the 
sweater and the length of the 
knives. 

Help comes through Nancy 
Thompson, played by 
Heather Langenkamp, the 
only remaining teenage 
survivor of the original, who 
has since gone to college to 
study dreams, and is staying 
alive by taking an experi-
mental dream suppressant. 

Thompson begins working 
with the teens and soon gains 
their trust as she relays her 
past experiences. She 
convinces the teens that 
through hypnosis they can 
band together and fight 
Freddy in his court, in a group 
dream. In the dream Freddy 
manipulates the teens by 
acting on their own fantasies, 
like a Willy Wonka possessed 
by the devil incarnate. With a 
teen who makes puppets, 
Freddy laces string through 
the teen's hands and feet and 
walks him off the top of a 
building. 

Silly, okay, stupid, 
probably, but in a morbid 
kind of way it's fun. True, the 

plot has as many holes as 
Freddy's victims, but let's give 
credit where credit is due. 

The special effects are 
wonderful, but even more so 
they are unique and 
imaginative. 

Finally, does Freddy die 
(again) at the end? It doesn't 
really matter. He's died three 
times before and that has 
never stopped him. Suffice to 
say that in about a year look 
for more fun with Freddy, but 
for now, if you enjoy horror 
films, and you have an 
imagination, go see "A 
Nightmare on Elm Street ) -
Dream Warriors." You'll 
never sleep again.
