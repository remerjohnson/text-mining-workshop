BERKELEY - A fire broke 
out behind Deutsch Hall early 
Sunday morning, Oct. 8, when 
a taxi driver lost control of his 
car, smashing into a set of gas 
meters. The leaking gas caught 
fire immediately, with flames 
rising 20 feet along the wall of 
the building before Berkeley 
fire fighters put out the blaze. 
Although the flames did not 
rise high enough to enter any 
windows, the building's 250 
residents were evacuated by 
housing officials. The driver 
of the cab suffered a small 
laceration on his leg, but no-
one else was injured in the

The charges stemmed from an

struck a local community

broken bones in his face, 
which caused his eye to swell 
shut, as well as a cut which 
required five stitches. The 
incident was the second

Carter was involved. If 
convicted, he faces up to

UC Students Stage 'Day of Action , 
UTOPIA: Price Center 
plaza changed into 
'Freedom City' 
By M ........ VIlli 
Senior Staff Writer 

The ongoing protest against the 
elimination of affirmative-action 
programs will reach into the class-
rooms of all nine UC campuses to-
day, as students systemwide stage 
what organizers are calling, "A Day 
of Action." 

UCSD's Price Center will play 

. 

host to "Freedom City" - a forum 
where speakers and performers alike 
will address civil-rights and affir-
mative-action issues - between 11 
a.m. and 2 p.m. 

I n addition, faculty and T As have 
been asked to relocate their classes 
to the Price Center for a "teach-in," 
and students are being encouraged 
to walk out of their classes. 

The event is organized by No 
Retreat!, a coalition formed at the 
beginning of the year which includes 
such groups as the Student Affirma-
tive-Action Committee, United Auto 

Workers, Associated Students and 
the Co-ops. 

According to Brian Dowd, in-
terim A.S. vice-president external 
and event organizer, the coalition's 
goal is to "educate on and advocate 
for civil rights." 

Original plans for the event began 
during an April meeting of students 
from across the UCsystem. Every UC 
campus wiu stage protests and walk-
outs, with Jesse Jackson delivering a 
speech at UC Berkeley. 

Organizers explained that the 
Oct. 12 date of the protest, which 

coincides with Columbus Day, was 
not accidental. 

"In fact, that was the whole idea," 
Dowd said. "We see it as Indig-
enous People's Day, and I think it is 
important that we don't lose sight of 
what this day really is." 

Although there is no official 
count as to how many professors 
and TAs will actually take part in 
the teach-in, A.S. President Naomi 
Falk did say that "a lot of literature 
professors are planning to partici-
pate."

Fugitive 
Arrested in 
CheGarden 
SUSPECT: Man is second in 
two years to be found in the 
garden behind the cafe 
By Ivan DelventMI 
Associate News Editor 

Although the Che Cafe and garden colJec-
tives are perhaps the least-visible areas of the 
UCSD campus, an arrest made Oct. 5 has 
brought the collectives under the spotlight 
once again. 

Responding to a report of a person being 
drunk in public outside the Che Cafe, UCSD 
police officers arrested a 34-year-old male non-
affiliate, whom they found sleeping in the gar-
den adjacent to the Cafe. After verifying the 
individual's identification, UCSD police dis-
covered that he was wanted on an outstanding, 
no-bail, felony warrant for parole violation in 
Arizona. 

Though the recent arrest differs in nature 
from another incident which occurred last year, 
it is the second time in as many years that a 
person wanted for a felony has been found 
staying in or near the collective. 

"It is not unusual for us to run across some-
one with misdemeanor wamnts for traffic, drug 
or DUI [offenses] on campus," said UCSD po-
lice officer Doug Odell. "But felony warrants 
are more rare."

FirstA.S. 'Town HaU' Meeting Inspires Lackluster Attendance 
MEAGER: Small 
student turnout 
disappoints council 
By !ather Yoon 
GuardllJll Reporter 

Last night's A.S. "Town Meet-
ing," an open forum held in the Muir 
quad, failed to raise student interest 
regarding campus issues, drawing 
an audience of only three people. 

At the meeting, council members 
discussed various A.S.-related is-
sues, proposals and upcoming 
events, and also answered students' 

questions. 
A.S. President Naomi Falk 

opened by addressing current mat-
ters, including the makeup of the 
upcoming selection committee for a 
new chancellor, who will take the 
top post at UCSD one year from 
now.. 

Falk announced plans to write a 
proposal expanding the current ap-
pointment process, which currently 
allows only one non-voting under-
graduate 3ludent onto the committee. 

"I'm disappointed with the lack 
of student involvement in this pro-
cess, seeing as this is an area which 

will affect them the most," Falksaid. 
She also spoke highly of interim 

UCSD Chancellor Marjorie 
Casserio's efforts to be more "ac-
cessible to students." Falk's com-
ments come in the wake of numer-
ous student complaints about the 
previous chancellor's lac:k of slu-
dent involvement. 

Later in the meeting, 
council members Brian Dowd and 
Greg Field spoke on affirmative 
action, and brought forward infor-
mation on today's "Freedom City" 
forum in the Price Center. 

One student in attendance initi-

ated debate over affirmative-action 
policies by questioning the A.S. 
External Affairs Office's support of 
such programs. 

"Affirmative action is one of the 
external campus issues that A.S. is 
currently working with," said Dowel, 
A.S. vice president of external af-
fairs. "It is very difficult to pro-
mote ... an ethnically diverse envi-
ronment without affirmative-action 
policies. " 

Dowd and Field detailed current 
external-Iffain projects for the small 
crowd, including free voter regis-

Because the program is so new,

stressed that it needs student feed-
back in order to become a success. 

Jones said the HPP currently of-
fers a volunteer placement program, 
peer discussion groups, pre-profes-

Jones also promised to provide 
guest speakers, including current

do in future interviews. 

"The discussion group will let 
me interact with other pre-med stu-

Heidi Muzhlk/ GuardIan

the crowd to stop hate crimes and violence. 

However, other 
LGBA members 
didn't seem quite as 
pleased with the 
crowd's reactiondur-
ing the evenl 

"There's not 
- enough spirit," said 

Muir junior Jack 
Huang. "It's a good 
step [to come to the

Matt Booker, a 
representative of the 
Christian group 
"Love in Action," 
was on hand at the 

rally, passing out literature decry-
ing homosexuality. 

"I appreciate their courage," 
Booker said. "It's admirable ... but 
I'm concerned about people and their 
Iivesand I'd like to help. lfeelJesus 
would want to help people." 

After Muhammed spoke, several 
students took advantage of tbe open 
microphone to express either feel-
ings about their own homosexuality 
or support for National Coming Out 
Day. 

"[Being open about homosexu-
ality is) about embracing every as-
pect of my life and being truthful of 
my complete self," Lee said. 

She added that National Coming 
Out Day is, "an attempt to make tbe 
gay, lesbian, and bisexual commu-
nities more visible to the dominant 
majority and hopefully have a more 
positive effect on heterosexual atti-
tudes, both on and off campus.· 

According to Nguyen, the Na-
tional Coming Out Day bas been 
going on at UCSD for at least five 
yeatS. Besides holding tbe annual 
event, the LGBA - which has ap-
proximately 40 members - spon-
sors dances, socials and educational 
forums. 

"[LGBA is) there if you or some-
one you know needs help coming 
out," Nguyen said. "We educate 
people on gay life here on campus 
and in San Diego in general." 

Lee said that coming out is "the 
desire to be bonest with one's self, 
friends, family and colleagues so 
that we no longer have to live in 
fear based on who we choose to 
love."

A.S. Should Stop Bickering 
And Start Repre.entlng 

At last week's Associated Students (AS.) meeting, 
Commissioner of Operations and Services Jean Lee asked 
for the removal of Sujata Shende, the AS. Representative to 
the Co-op Oversight Committee_ Lee argued that Shende's 
position is a clear conflict of interest, because she also 
happens to be the Student Co-op fInancial bookkeeper. 

However, according to A.S. President Naomi Falk, the 
AS. had this infonnation upon Shende's original appoint-
ment, which was approved by three different AS. commit-
tees at that time. Incredibly, Lee did not seem to notice this 
conflict of interest until now. 

A1thougb AS. members argued about the issue, it was 
never resolved, and Lee's request has since been withdrawn. 
This time-consuming and pointless debate should have been 
resolved months ago, when the A.S. first appointed Shende. 

Lee wasted both the A.S.' and students' time bringing up 
a stale argument. And Falk should not have wasted her own 
time writing letters to convince everyone that the issue was 
indeed stale. 

Rather than spending countless hours arguing over petty 
issues, our AS. representatives should be representing the 
student body. UCSO students are apathetic about campus 
issues and politics because they believe the A.S. doesn't 
accomplish anything. The AS. should be actively working 
to change this image, not perpetuate it. 

For the few of us who bothered to vote in the A.S. 
elections last spring. we have yet to see any substantial 
action. And, as for .the multitudes of students who did not 
bother to vote, they have no reason to care. 

'Freedom City': Better in

If any issue surrounding the UC system warrants discus-
sion and debate, it is the UC regents' recent decision to 
repeal affinnative action. An open forum, with interaction 
between faculty, staff and students, would be an exceUent 
way to open up lines of communication and start addressing 
this volatile issue. 

However, holding a counterproductive "teach-in" at the 
Price Center, calling it a "utopia of campus," and labeling it 
"Freedom City" is a foolish proposition. No Retreat! - a 
coalition fonned by members of the Associated Students, 
Graduate Student Association and others - is doing just 
that, encouraging students to walk out and attend its "educa-
tional event'! from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. today. ' '. 

While No Retreat!'s original intent may have been 
worthwhile, the idea of a one-sided rally to save affirmative 
action is flawed for several reasons. 

First, the very fact that the event will be held in the Price 
Center is a humorous contradiction. The Price Center, as 
any UCSO alumnus will tell you, is a symbol of administra-
tive will. A money-making machine, it was built in 1989 

~gainst the protest of numerous students, including mem-
bers of the AS., GSA and activist groups. A "teach-in" held 
at the Price Center does nothing more than validity the 
administration's - and the ue regents' - power. 

Secood, declaring that somehow only in "Freedom City" 
does "racism, sexism or any other prejudices" not exist is 
c:hiIdisb and naive. It insinuates that, by simply labeUoS an 
area "utopia, .. theae evils will disIppear. It also mocb 
whatever progress the university bu been striving to mate, 
as if UCSO's anti-disaiminatioo policies were meaninaIesa. 

Finally, the No Retreatl rally in the Price Center does 
absolutely notbin& 10 aid the development of diversity in the 
UC system. Affinnativc action is gone, and it's not COIIIiag 
bIck any time IOOD. Coastrudive measures need to be 
disc:us8ed and Ided upon to foster diversity for the future.

Chances are, if you are the

parked in front of a television 
set, aimlessly wandering 
through a myriad of shows 
that you will not be able to 
recall 24 hours later. This

was a novelty

has become a

This is a cheap shot. Even with close to 15 percent of 
men surveyed answering, "I Don't watch TV," the 
group averaged 35 hours. 

Thirty-five hours. 1,820 hours per year. 
In a lifetime, these men spend over 100,000 

hours dedicated to passively viewing electrons danc-
ing on a litlle screen. This serves, mainly, to enrich 

the lives of those peddling products 
into the homes of tbeir customers, via 
the only unobstructed higbway.

every conceivable need you have. 
Even when individual commercials 
dim -in the memory, the ghost of the 
consumer consciousness lingers in our 
minds.

a day watching television. With eight

COMMENTARY: In recognizing Columbus Day as a national holiday, the United States commemorates the 
legacy of a murderer, as well as centuries of colonization and slavery 

CELEBRATING 500 YEARS OF OPPRESSION 
By Klllldnn Lytle 
Staff Writer 

Colum~ ~y remains a day of 
national observance because the 

. United States thrives upon revital-
ized methods of oppression, colo-
nization and slavery, fii'st practiced 
by a.ristopher Columbus. 

Columbus initiated the exter-
_ mination of entire populations, 

which he deemed unworthy of life 
unless they were under hi. subju-
gation. On hi. second expedition 
to the Caribbean in 1495, Colum-
bus went from island to island, 
taking Native-Americans captive. 

When he arrived in Haiti, Co-
lumbus demaDded a specific amount 
of gold from each of the native 
Arawaks over the age of 14. If 
someone did not collect enough, his 
or her b.ud was cut off, leaving the 
person to bleed to death. However, 
there is little gold to be found on 
Haiti. 

After two years of Columbus' 
terror, half of the island's 250,000 
Arawaks committed suicide, were 
murdered or sold into slavery to es-
cape Columbus' brutality. By 1650, 
the legacy set forth by Columbus 
had been brought forth the success-
ful termination of everyone in the 
Arawak nation. Columbus' skills 
led to the murder of over 250,000 
people in the Caribbean. And this is 
the man we have chosen to idolize. 

Columbus colonized Indian 
nations in the Caribbean to deplete 

the land of its natural resources -
particularly gold. When he didn't 
find any gold, Columbus settled 
for taking the natives u slaves. 
The United States' official recog-
nition of Columbus as a "great 
man" ~nd a pioneer is both honest 
and offensive. It's honest because 
his legacy of colonization - or 
non-legacy, in the case of the 
Arawak culture and lineage - is 
deeply ingrained in the American 
economy. It's offensive because it 
denies the truth about Columbus' 
actions and accomplishments. 

From a blunt and straightfor-
ward perspective, why shouldn't 
we celebrate Columbus Day? We, 
u Americans, have embodied his 
ideu of violence, oppression and 
colonization to this day. 

The definition of colonization, 
old or new, must include the fol-
lowing elements: restricted mobil-
ity, the lack of political represen-
tation and the presence of "unfree" 
labor - non-slave labor, in which 
the workers are threatened at all 
times. The two-, most obvious ex-
amples of American colonization 
are actually internal, occurring 
within our national boundaries. 
The first of thest was the initial 
colonization of this country with 
slaves. 

Men, women and children 
from the African continent were 

for~ibly imported to America as a 
subjugated workforce. (These

Idolize 
people did not consider them-
selves Africans, as we do today, 
because they represented many 
peoples from many nations and 
tribes.) Slave codes restricted a 
slave's mobility beyond the pre-
determined limits of his muter. 
And, although slaves were 
counted as three-fifths of a person 
for representation purposes, the 
representation of white men was 
all that counted in government. 

Slaves received no compensa-
tion for their labor. American mu-
ters received all the rewards for their 

work. While many America .. have 
come to recognize slavery condi-
tions in our past, it is this same form 
of oppression, which currently sup-
porta our prelCnt economy, that we 
need to confront and cliunantIc. 

This current oppression is pres-
ently the abuse of undocumented 
laborers, representing America's 
ongoing entrenchment in coloniza-
tion. 

My experiences in working 
witb migrant workers confirmed 
tbat undocumented laborers, par-
ticularly Mexicans, suffer from 
contemporary systems of coloni-
zation and slavery. Whatever 
someone may feel about the pres-
ence of undocumented laborers, he 
cannot deny their daily economic 
contributions. 

In San Diego County, it is com-
mon for undocumented laborers to 
be paid $1 for every 35 pounds of 
fruit picked. On a good day, a 
worker may earn $15 for eight hours 
of labor. One particular farm owner 
in San Diego requires laborers to 
work two free days, so.that he may 
work the third day for pay. This si-
lenced and colonized population 
provides the backdrop for our daily 
lives. ' 

Undocumented laborers fit the 
definition of a colony, due to the 
confining conditions of their labor 
and their presence as a people. 
Their work is "unfree- because of 
the international economic condi-

tions wbicb fOller and abuse their 
poverty. The bunger in theirstom-
acbs pusbed them into the United 
States, and they stayed for the 
low-paying jobs reserved specifi-
cally for tbem. 

~employersc~im­
migrant laborers because the work-
ers have no avenues of RCOunc for 
their oppression. To wbom is an 
undocumented immigrant going to 
report being paid $ 1 for two houn 
of work? 

The social and political 
marginalization of undocumented 
laborers prevents tbem from pro-
testing against their abuses. Strik-
ing for beller conditions and 
wages is a middle-class strategy, 
employed by tbose who have sav-
ings, unions or otber systems to 
fall back upon. Without political 
and financial influence, undocu-
mented workers are trapped, hav-
ing to aCCCpllow wages and haz-
ardous working conditions. 

Without basic rights and politi-
cal influence, undocumented la-
borers cannot freely move about 
in our society. It is ironic that tbey 
can work all day out in a field, a 
hotel or in our homes without wor-
rying about "Ia migra," but when 
tbey retire to their beds, they must 
sleep witb one eye open. We give 
them tbe freedom to work, but not 
to live. We want to reap the ben-
efits of tbeir labor, but do not want

6 OPINION 

EdItor: 
We are amazed at the GuardUul:S 

incompetence when reporting the 
events which transpired the night 
before the Associated Students 
(A.S.) mecting("A.S. Argues about 

~, Rep. Removal,· Oct. 5, 1995). 
The article is misleading. and the re-
ported facts are downright wrong. 

First, the ChC Cafe does not owe 
the A.S. $5,000. If we were audited, 
it would cost an estimated $3,000, 
which we ourselves would have to 
pay. This has not been paid yet. In-
stead, we are having a less-costly 
financial review of our bookkeep-
ing. This decision has been endorsed 
by both A.S. President Naomi Falk 
and the Graduate Student Associa-' 
tion (GSA), who have determined 
that the Chi's financial liability at 
risk at the Chi is less than the 
amount which would have to be 
paid for an audit. Thus, it would be 
unnecessary for the Chi to have a 
full audit done at this time. 

Second, the quote attributed to 
Falk - that the Che owes the A.S. 
S5,000 - is wrong. Rather, she said 
that the Co-oplare required to have 
audits done - who pays for the

audits is open to dilCUSSion. 
Third, tbe quote attributed to 

GSA President Steve Dubb was ac-
tually made by Doug Cronyn, a core 
member of the Che - however, the 
quote was a loose paraphrase, at 
best. This misquote was comcted 

colonized as Mricans were, a little 
over a century ago. Colonization is 
an American tradition, which is why 
we celebrate Columbus Day. After 
arriving in the Caribbean, Colum-
bus wrote about the natives: "They 
would make fine serVants ... with 50 
men, we could subjugate them an, 
and make them do whatever we 
want." 

in the Monday issue of the Guard-
ian, althougb this correction was 
also wrong. An audit will cost an es-
timated $3,000, not S5,000, as was 
stated in the correction. Also, Doug 
Cronyn is a member of tbe Cb6 
Cafe, not the Food Co-op, as was 
reported in the correction. It also 
incorrectly inferred that the A.S. had 
oot been paid for debts owed them 
by the Chi. 

We ll'Iink that it would be appro-
priate for the Guardian to print a 
front-page retraction of the story 
printed last Thursday. We welcome 
tbe opportunity to discuss the role 
of the Chi and the Co-ops in the 
campus community and to clarify 
the agreements we made with the 
A.S., GSA and the UCSO adminis-
tration. 

However, the Guardian must 
hold itself responsible for tbe rep-
rehensible job of reporting this story 
and should take steps to correct the 
misconceptions which it generated.

Using the economy as a weapon, 
we have subjugated a labor force in 
America, which will do the jobs that 
we don't want to recognize. Every-
day, every American - even the 
poor - benefits from the coloniza-
tion of undocumented laborers. Our 
fruits and vegetables may be cheap, 
but our souls will eventually pay the 
price.

eRE: Wanted man 
from Arizona found 
asleep in garden 
Continued from paCe 1 
following the airing on television of 
an episode of "America's Most 
Wanted" - lJCSO police received 
a tip that a man volunteering for the 
Ch6 Caf6 closely resembled an indi-
vidual profiled on the show. 

According to the program, the 
suspect, Mark Mallet, was wanted 
for questioning in connection with 
the 1987 slaying of his business 
associate 's son in Hilo, Hawaii. 

Because the suspect fled imme-
diately after the airing of the show, 
UCSO police never made an arrest 
in the case, but outside law-enforce-
ment officials have since confirmed 
that Mark Mallet (a.k.a. Sonny Jack-
son) was indeed the individual who 
had been volunteering at the Ch6 
Cafe. 

Though no one in the collective 
knows the man who was recently 
arrested, the fact that two felons 
have been found staying near the 
Ch6 Cafe raises questions as to why 
these individuals took refuge at the 
UCSO campus. 

.. It's the garden," collective 
member John Skrinska said. "It hap-
pens every once in a while that 
people come by and crash. Unfortu-
nately, it does kind of attract the 
people who are trying to keep a low 
profile from the law." 

Odell agreed that the Ch6's re-
mote location is an appealing loca-
tion for peoplc "passing through." 

"The reason we pick up people 
out by the CM is that it is an unde-
veloped area of campus. We used to 
run into people sleeping in the north 
part of campus, when it was shrubs 
and bushes," he said. 

"Since they built the parking lots, 
though, those numbers have de-
creased. These are usually just 
people passing through, looking for 
a place to sleep," Odell added. 

Skrinska, who knew Sonny 
Jackson when he was volunteer-
ing at the Co-op, described him as 
"a really nice person who had a 
bad temper." 

According to Skrinska, Jackson 
turned himself in to federal authori-
ties just over six months ago. 

Collective members said they do 
not see the current situation as prob-
lematic, adding that they are not 
laking any specific measures to pre-

ContInued from .,... 1

Dead Presidents Takes on 
Racial and Political Issues 
Hughes brothers' latest film lives up to 

their previous effort 
By JeffNI .... 
Histus Editor 

The Walking Dead, a movie released earlier 
this year about the experienccs of AfricanAmeri-
cans in Vietnam, tried to draw a parallel between 
the deaths of Mrican Americans during the war 
and their current struggle in America's inner 
cities. The film made a good point, but because 
of poor acti ng and a confusing plot, 
critics panned it, and audiences 
avoided it. 

Dead Presidents, the latest ef-
fort by the Hughes brothers, has an 
agenda similarto that of The Walk-
ing Dead. But being such a power-
ful film, it will likely meet with 
more critical and popular approval. 

The film starts in the late '60s, 
as Anthony Curtis (Larenz Tate) 
graduates from highschool. Against 
his parents' wishes, Curtis enlists in the Ma-
rines. Although his friends, Skip (Chris Tucker) 
and Jose (Freddy Rodriguez), join him, the 
experience is harrowing. Even the preacher, 
aeon (Bokeern WcxxlHne), changes while in 
the jungle, taking tbe bead of an enemy soldier 
as a souvenir. The amount of carnage and blood 
in this film makes Apoc4Iypse Now look like 
Little House on the PrrIirie. 

nam, Curtis ends up working at a butcher shop. 
He inevitably reverts back to violence after 
experiencing a horrifying nightmare, in which 
human and animal bodies ronverge into one. 
Eventually, Curtis loses his job, and devises a 
plan to steal money that the feden! government 
planned to destroy. 

The heist scene is the best part of the film, and 
more time could have been dedi-
cated to setting it up. As it is, how-
ever, the action is brilliantly ex-
ecuted. Making the criminals apply 
white face paint is a subtle com-
mentary on the ways in which Mri-
can Americans are demonized -
such as with the usual donning of a 
dark ski mask or stocking. 

While Dead PresidenlS doesn't 
glorify the robbery, it does show 
how social circumstances contrib-

uted to the characters' need to steal the money. 
The film also oomments'on American politics, 
as a flag waves in the corner of the screen while 
Curtis and his pals attack the money-carrying 
truck. 

Dead Prtsidellls rnay, ultimalcly, span too 
large a time frame. But its mixture of politics 
with pure suSpense makes ita worthy follow-up 
to the Hughes brothers· debut, MeNICe /I Soci-

counuy of Andrew Cooper 
Tou", guy: Robert Rath (Sylvester Stallone) is a free-lance hit man in Assassins. 

Stallone and Banderas 
Are a Hit in Assassins 
Richard Donner's new film offers 

more than just action 
By D.nOk.d. 
Guardisn Reporter 

Richard Donner's new film, As-
SQSSins, portrays the shadowy world 
of hit men and information rouriers in 
a fairly reaJistic(by Hollywood 's stan-
dards) manner. Far from being atypi-
cal, all-out, guns-a-blazing action film 
- as many may be led to believe by 
the film's previews - Assassins is 
actually more like a thriller, driven by 
its ably developed characters. 

Although the plot does not win 
any points for originality, the charac-
ters and the overall film contain 
enough pleasant surprises to make 
Assassinsfresh and well worth watch-
ing. The present-day story 
follows the exploits of 
Robert Rath (Sylvester 
Stallone), the most pro-
lific hitman of his time. 

Rath, whose career 
dates beck to theCold War 
of the 198Os, has man-
aged to survive by main-
taining an isolationist ex-
istence, leaving no evi-
dence of his whereabouts 
and, of OOUISe, remaining ever-vigi-
lant. The Cold War provided him 
with a sense of duty and morality. and 
it convinced him that his work was 
for the greater good. 

But that dutiful sense left his life 
with Glasnost, forcing his "skills" to 
be exploited in a free-lance world, 
which is governed by business inter-
ests and profits. Rath realizes that, at 
the peak of his career, he bas lost his 
motivation to be the best, and that this 
violenlllfeslyleotJersnore\ease,save 
death. Hisposltioa at the top will only 
Jut unlil a younser, more ambitious 
predatoranivcstochallenp his stand-
ina-

Miguel Sain, played by Antonio 
Banderas (straight out of his role as a 
fiery killer in Desperado), decided to 
niake it his life's calling to be the one 
to depose Rath from his lofty position. 
Bain possesses the inner fire and am-
bition that Rath had long since lost 

To Bain, there is a certain roman-
tic quality to an assassin.!s lifestyle, 
where life resembles a game of chess. 
with real people serving as the pawns. 
He believes the possibility of death 
serves only to raise the stakes of the 
game. 

Bain, however. possessesastrange 
codeof!K>nor, letting Rathknowafter 
their first meeting that he intends to 

kill the famed assassin, 
even as he expresses his 
admiration and respect for 
Rath's work. 

Electra (Julianne 
Moore) is introduced into 
the slory as an accom-
plished, compuler-hack-
ing informalion courier, 
who inlercepts a satellite 
transm ission ronlaining 
particularly sensitive data. 

Electra obtains information and sells 
it to various interests, leading her to 
live a nomadic lifestyle, virtually iden-
tical to that of an assassin. 

Although FJectra' s at the top of 
her field, she remains an isolationist, 
skirting the edges of society, 0011-
slantly watching people and gather-
ing information. 

II is not until she encounters Rath, 
who has been oontracted to kill her for 
the intercepted satellite transmission, 
that she is forced to interact with an-
other person on an intimate level. 

The role of Rath wu rnadespecifi-
cally for SCaIIone, u he fill it like a 
well-tailonld suit While this 10ft of 

role is standard for him, he plays the 
part as only Stallone can. Old fans of 
his may not be surprised much, but, on 
the other hand, they shouldn't be dis-
appointed either. 

Antonio Banderas is rapidly build-
inga reputationasoneofHollywood's 
rising stars. Expect to see him head-
line many more films in the near fu-
ture. . 

Viewers who see Banderas inDes-
perado and the forthooming Never 
Talk to Strangers, may be misled to 
believe that he will only be typecast as 
a psychotic killer, but, given his tal-
ent, he will probably delve into newer 
roles. 

Julianne Moore oontinues to sur-
prise and please. She successfully 
throws herself into yet another type of 
role that she was yet to explore. The 
diversity of her roles stretches from 
parts in The Hand T1ulI RocIcs the 
Cradle.and The Fugitive to Benny and 
Joon and the recent Nine MOfIIhs. 
Unlike Banderas and Stallone, Moore 
~as given the opportunity to explore 
a new kind of character. 

GNenthe marketability of Stallone 
movies and the strong presence of the 
red-hot Banderas, Assassins will un-
doubtedly be successful at the box 
office. 

Altliough the film fails to make 
leaps and bounds in teons of original-
ity, the tried-and-true formula of a 
good thriller/suspense movie (defi-
nitely not just another action movie) 
should prove highly entertaining for 
most viewers. 

With its numerous nerve-racking 
scenes,. fair share of gun play and an 
explosion or two, Warner Brothers 
has a guaranteed hit on ill hands.

(Angela Bassett) and Max (Tom 
Sizemore), to track the killer. Here, 
the film begins to get confusing. 

The eve of the millenia, increased 
crime and racial tensions - and the 
murderof an influential rapstar/mili-
tant activist - Jericko One (Glenn 
Miller), all serve to bewilder the au-
dience, as well as dilute an already 
jumbled plot. 

Amid the chaos of Lenny's real 
and "Playback" worlds, it's hard to 
focus on a solilary storyline. One gets 
lost in a sea of plots and subplots, 
trying to focus on everything from 
Lenny's past to the movie's three 
main villains. The filmmakers may 
have intended "Playback" to serve as 
a metaphor for life's dreams and fan-
tasies, but with such a complicated 
plot, the movie's message is lost. 

Strange Days opens tomorrow at 
theaters throughout San Diego.

The Bogmen 
Life Begins at 40 MiUion 

ArIste Records 
You wouldn't normally expect 

great music from five Ivy Leagu-
ers, who all spent time working on 
clam barges off Long Island. But 
the Bogmen deliver. Their debut 
album showcases apocalyptic vi-
sions, concealed behind 
an upbeat, funky sound. 

The lead track, "The 
Big Bum," sounds like 
a military parade that 
took a seriously wrong 
turn. Lead singer Bill 
Campion shrieks, "But-
ton your lip - You're 
talking out! of turn! An-
other cell out of your 
brain! Another marble 
from the urn." 

Songs such as "Yellar" and "Piss 
Tongue" have an edgy, Talking 
Heads feel, with intriguing lyrics 
that ring of David Byrne's "This is 
not my beautiful wife." 

This similarity can most directly 
be attributed to the album 's pro-

duction, spearheaded by former 
Talking Heads keyboardist Jerry 
Harrison. Harrison adds his own 
personal touch, which adds to the 
delirium of 40 Million. 

The prize gem of the album is 
"Suddenly," the band's 
tribute to gelling 
dumped. Lyrics, such 
as "I cling to clothes 
she used to wear! Try 
them on and style my 
hair.! Suddenly I could 
never be as fine! asshe./ 
I 've got her eyes - but I 
sure don' t have! her 
teeth," describe the 
everyman's despair. 

The Bogmen's upbeat sound, 
combined with an interactive CD! 
ROM format, which works on both 
stereo and computer equipment, 
makes Life Begins at 40 Million 
one of the most unique debuts of 
1995.

By Clayton Payne 
Guardian Reporter 

The CoreUiDn Trilogy - the lat-
est sequence of Star Wars novels -
whisks the heroes of George Lucas' 
filmic masterpieces through an ex-
hilarating, fast-paced and well-writ-
ten adventure. Author Roger 
Macbride Allen, a career science-
fJction novelist, follows the lead of 
numerous other writers, who had 
continued the escapades of Luke 
Skywalker and company from the 
movies to the printed medium for 
Bantam Books. Twelve years since 
the release of the last movie, several 
books have been published, continu-
ing the development of the story. 

Allen's novels unfold 17 years 
aftertheeventsofthefilm, 
RelW7l of the Jedi. True 
to the Star Wars style, the 
first book, Ambush at 
Corellia, explodes with 
excitement, as Han Solo, 
his Wookie co-pilot 
Olewbacca, Leia Organa 
Solo (now Han's wife and 
Cltief of Slate of the New 
Republic) and their chil-
dren-Anakin,Jainaand 
Jacen - are caught in the grasp of 
galactic chaos. 

While on a diplomatic mission to 
Han's home world of Corellia, the 
fledgling government of the New 
Republic is attacked. A mysterious 
group's scheme to topple the govern-
ment begins with a fierce, bigoted 
civil war in the Corellian sector of 
space, ultimately thrusting Han and 
his family into a race for survival. 

To make mailers worse, villains 
threaten the entire solar system with 
the destructive "Starbuster Plot," a 
device with the potential to destroy 
entire stars. The New Republic sends 
in the cavalry, as Luke Skywalker 
and Lando Calrissian lead a motley 
assortment of allies to war. 

Action sequences are fast and fu-
rious, IS Allen -like his pred" s-

sors - captures the heart of the Star 
. Wars thriU, p~viding lively poetic 
words and sharp descriptions. Ban-
tam Books has striven for continuity, 
interweaving aspects from aJJ the past 
and present Star Wars novels. 

Allen's is one of the best books so 
far, combining chaBcters and events 
from previous oovels into his own 
story, which includes the popular 
character of Mara Jade, from Timo-
thy Zahn'sbooksequence. Although 
it is oot necessary to have read all of 
the books with events prior to those 
ofTheCorellianTriIo8)',itdoesbelp. I 

The modem~y theme of racism 
is an element~f Allen's book, but it is 
oot overbearing, sour or preachy. 
Many booksfail tousereal-lifethemes 

in their fantasy stories, 
due to the author's often 
excessive morality. Allen 
keeps his morals out of 
the adventure, usingonJy 
those of the characters, 
both good and evi~ IS a 
basis forthe reactionsand 
countereactions to racism 
within the plot. Subtle use 
of current events adds a 
more human element, 

drawing readers further into the ex-
citement of the tale. 

Excitement aside, the truly re-
markable achievementof Allen 'ssaga 
is the research he puts into each 
character's role, and the additional 
development he orchestrates, particu-
larly in Han's character. Keeping his 
persona true to the one portrayed by 
actor Harrison Ford in the movies has 
proven to be a tough obstacle for 
many of Bantam Books' Star Wars 
authors. Allen, however, is a gleam-
ing exception. 

A devoted Star Wars fan could 
imagine Ford, in the character of 
Han,doingeverythingAl1endepicted. 
The shining jewel of this is Han as a 
father figure. Allen crafts Han IS a 
realistic parent: hopeful, loving and 
slightly overprotective ~ a much

better depiction of a parent than he 
gave to Leia. 

And what would parents be with-
out their children? Han and Leia's 
Jedi children are very appealing char-
acters to readers, who will often find 
themselves rooting for Anakin, Jaina 
and Jacen as much as they did for the 
characters' parents in the original 
movies. Character development is a 
well-used craft in Allen's trilogy. 
Even minor characters become in-
creasingly spectacular as the story 
dashes along. Several mioor sub 
plots keep the story fresh. 

As good as the characters are, 
onJy an extraordinary ending could 
suffice. Yet Allen falters, producing 
only a marginal, flaccid conclusion. 
The events leading up to the climax 
keep one's pulse streaming, but when 
the peak is reached, the story just 
dwindles to a stop. The reader finaJJy 
discovers who the "true" masterminds 
of the "Starbuster Plot" are, but 00 
knowledge is gained about the vil-
lains' motivations and aspirations, 
leaving one's mind slightly starved.

Newman's Wicked Tongue 
Singer-pianist Randy Newman shows his 
sarcastic side at Playhouse on Monday 

By Jeff NIeMI 
Hiatus Editor 

On the soundtrack to "Randy 
Newman's Faust, " the play currently 
in production at the La Jolla Play-
house, Newman sings the 
part of the devil (played 
on stage by David Garri-
son). It's apparent from 
the ease with which 
Newman sings and writes 
the character's lines, that 
he has a few things in 
common with the devi-
ous creature. 

During a benefit con-
cert Monday night at the 
HI Jolla Playhouse, Newman's can-
tankerous self reared its head, as he 
sarcastically joked about everything 
from the "province" of San Diego to 
the shoddy Playhouse production of 
his flawlessly written play. 

He was, of course,joking, but both 
his sense of humor and the occasional 
glimpse of his more sensitive side 
made for an enjoyable, though hardly 
top-notch, performance. 

During his 32-song 
set, Newman bit virtually 
every possible hand that 
fed him (even making fun 
of the patrons who 
plunked down $250 for 
the benefit tickets). He 
simply wanted to get a 
good laogh, and see how 
hard he could bite. 

He realized his limits 
when, at one poi nt, after 

he insulted the Iightoperator, Newman 
was literally left in the dark. He took 
the hint, leaving the lighting director 
out of his remaining tirades. 

Perhaps best known for '" Love 
L.A." and "Short People," a song 

which still drew laughs from the audi-
ence, Newman inhabited the mindset 
of mainstream Americans in his songs. 
Whether capturing the mentality of 
Southern rebels ("Political Sciencej 
or of white trash ("Rednecks"), 
Newman described prejudices-and _ 
then made fun of them. 

While Newman's sarcastic put-
downs and jokes drew laughs from 
the audience, he was C(jually capable 
of beautifu I ballads. Love songs, such 
as "Real Emotional Girl," showed his 
capacity for genuine feeling. 

For the most part, new songs from 
the Faust soundtrack like "Pass On 
Over" and "Can't Keep a Good Man 
Down" fit well in the set Asongfrom 
the forthcoming soundtrack to Toy 
Story also worked well. 

While his musical skills weren't 
astonishing, Newman's sense of hu-
mor gets sharper as he ages.

WHAT IS THE BEST EXCUSE FOR AVOIDING JURY DUTY? 

You just say you have tests 
and postpone it .... Probably 
financial hardship [would 
work], if you can get away 
with it .... But being on a jury 
within the last three years is 
the best excuse. They have to 
accept it.

"'We were relaxed after tbe 
two big wins," UCSD's 
Chilton said. "'It was good to 
get the 'W.' Those two wins 
were so big. Buically,oursea-
son was on the line, and we 
came through. I think it has 
brought the team a lot closer 
than [it was) before." 

At the start of the second 
half, the score remained I-I, 
and UCSD came out of the box 
quickly to notch tbe go-ahead 
goal. At the 52:53 mark, the 
eventual game-winner was 
thrust into tbe Sagehen net by 
senior Eric Waldman. Witb his 
sixth goal of the season, 
Waldman increased his team 
lead in points to 13. . 

PaaInI r.ncy: Senior Nick Terlecky dishes out the 
ball during UCSO's win over Pomona. He has been 
a force in the midfield all year for the Tritons. 

The play started with a 
couple of passes up the field by 
the UCSD defense. Chris Braga 
then picked up a rebound off a 
Shane Ferber pass and tried to 
make a play, but his pass was . 
deflected. The ball went right to 
an awaiting Waldman, who bur-

PITZED: UCSD 
conquered Pomona, 2-1 
Continued from .,... 20 
going to be really important, if we are 
going to make the playoffs," he added. 

From this point of the game on, UCSD 
patiently waited for its next opportunity 
while the opposition tried {ranti-
cally to gain possession of the 
ball. With UCSD'sstardefender, 
Ken Burns, out with an injury, 
Joel Kosakoff took over the 
sweeper job nicely. Armstrong 
was able to juggle his line-up,

"'fan-addict," because it clearly gets bip 
justifying its pathetic life througb tbe 
achievements of othen. 

In stark contrut to this reaembluce 
of a mammal, I would consider myKlf 
u, simply, asporta fan. 

Wbat is tbe difference, you ask? 
Well, [ am overcome with joy when 

my favorite team comes out on top, and 
when tbey should happen to lose a con-
test to some inferior team tbat simply got 
lucky, I sulk for about an hour - not a 
minute more .. 

However, this unemployed, drunken, 
making-an-ass-out-of-itself moron is the 
worst example of what being a fan is all 
sbout. 

A fan is someone who roots for his 
favorite team, regardless of whether the 
results are good or bad. A real fan sticks 
with his team in bad times as well as 
good. A real fan goes to the ballpark to 
show his support, no matter the team's 
chances of victory . 

A rell fan does not behave like a 
hyper monkey or down five gallons of 
brew to psyche himself up for the big 
game (thereby rendering himself inca-
pable of coherent thought by the fourth 
quarter) . 

I just hope everyone in the establish-
ment with me on Monday evening was 
able to enjoy tbe game in spite of this 
"fan-addict." Perhaps they enjoyed a 
chuckle at its expense or grinned crossly 
at it when it sought their approval. 

As for me, I hope to forget this expe-
rience as quickly as possible and move 
on with my life. Perhaps another round 
of S 1 beers will have a more positive 
effect on me than monkey boy.

THE CYNIC 
SEAN RAHIMI 

And I thought 
I Was a Fanatic 

There I was, .minding my 
own business at my favorite 
sports bar, watching another 
installment of Monday Night 
Football- God's gift to 
sports fanatics such as 
myself, who do not get their 
fill of football during the 
weekend - when all the 
problems began. 

To be honest, the only 
reason my lazy butt garnished 
a chair in that classy joint 
was that I could never shy 
away from "$1 beer night." 
On this evening, there was 
the added motivation of a 
fierce rivalry between the 
bometown Chargers and the 
hated Kansas City Chiefs. 
Needless to say, the place 
was jumping. 

I, being a loyal Niners fan, 
had no particular interest in 
tbe game's final outcome. 
However, the contest was 
interesting enough, so I stuck 
around until the end. 

If I had known what was 
in store for myself and the 
other patrons, I would have 
run out of there faster than a 
white comedian bombing at 
the Apollo theater.

aySUn RMlmi 
Associate Sports Editor 

Three for three. 
That was the goal of the UCSD 

men's soccer team entering this 
past weekend. Every game was a 
"must win," and the Tritons ulti-
mately came through. 

After defeating 
Chapman and Washington 
University (MO) on Fri-
day and Sunday, respec-
tively, UCSD completed 
the sweep on Monday, 
outdueling Pomona-
Pitzer, 2-1 at Triton Soc-
cer Stadium. 

Don't let the close score fool 
you: The home team was over-
powering, toying with the visit-
ing Sagehens throughout the en-
tire contest. 

The game started inauspi-
ciously for UCSD, as Pomona-
Pitzer scored three minutes into 
the contest. Sagehen forward An-
drew Dilworth stole tbe ball on 
the left side of the field, and -
after driving down the line and 

towards the goal- he whistled a 
shot past netminder Jason 
Reynoso into the far corner. It 
gave his team a quick, and unex-
pected, 1-0 lead. 

The result did not go over too 
well with the Tritons, as they re-

taliated only nine minutes 
later. Junior forward Nate 
Hetherington dribbled down 
the right line and through 
the Pomona defense, draw-
ing a foul just outside the 
I8-yard box. Senior de-
fender Matt Chilton ap-
proached the ball, and 

cranked a left-footed shot that car-
omed off a couple of defenders-
and past the diving Sage hen goal-
keeper - for the tying score. 

"We got a goal scored against 
us, and that wasn't planned," Tri-
ton Head Coach Derek Armstrong 
said. "But we did what was neces-
sary to win the game, and that's 
pleasing. 

"Now we've got five more 
games, and every one of them is 

See PllZED, Page 18 

Here's how things 
developed into the mess that I 
call "the Monday night 
massacre." Only a couple of 
feet away from our table sat a 
Charger fan. At first sight, he 
seemed innocent enough, 
with his mug '0 beer and his 
Charger cap. 

But that, my friends, was a 
cover-up. This thing was not 
human. I shall call it "the 
fan-addict." Wearing its 
custom-made, perfectly 
tailored-to-its-head cap and 
matching Charger shirt, it sat 
on a stool, staring intently at 
the television set nestled high 
on the wall, only inches away 
from its cranium.

ALL BARK: UCSD clobbered the 
University of Redlands, 17-7, to 
capture its second consecutive victory 
By Dan Sweeney 
Senior Staff Writer 

Things arc looking up for the 
UCSD men's water polo team. 

Having suffered through a nine-
game losing streak 
earlier in the season, 
the Tritons won their 
second-consecutive 
game on Tuesday 
afternoon at 
Canyonview Pool, 
crushing the Univer-
sity of Redlands 

of Whit- tier Col-
lege. 

"We expected 
Redlands to swim 
well ' with us," 
UCSD assistant 
coach Larry Sanders 
said. "But their ball 
skills weren't what 
we thought they 
would I?e." Having guzzled enough 

beers to drown the Titanic -
and a small carrier group to 
boot - it gradually began 
burling expletives at anyone 
within a five-foot radius of 
its percb.

During its two-game win streak, 

UCSD's offense has been on a 
roll, outscoring its opponents by a

out lethargic in the
