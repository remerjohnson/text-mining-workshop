Abo'rtion Coverage Drops 
But Not Due to Protests 

By Alison Hall 
Staff Writer 

Despite efforts to cut off UC funds for 
abortions, registration fees are paying 
for the operations again this year. 
"Pregnancy coverage of $100 is 
avai lable to female stud nts who 
conceive during the chool year. 

Two years ago, Blue Cross insurance 
company covered UCSD and covered 
abortion costs up to $200. Lasl year, 
with the same company, the coverage 
was $150. Contraceptive counselor 

hdron Keating says eith r she or 
Director V. Robert Allen (Keating says 
she "doesn't remember whi h" and 
Allen declines comment) told the 
insurance company to lower the benefit, 
as abortions did not cost $200, and 
doctors would be overcharging if they 
wer.e to collect the full amount. 

This year, with reg fees paying the 
Health Center directly; the $100 per 
year is available for " pregnancy 
coverage," either abortion or delivery. 
Repeat abortions, Keatin!{ says, are 
minimal in the UCSD population and 
that "very few people use abortion as a 
conscious decision for contraception." 
She estimates that 140 abortions were 
referred through the health center last 
year. 

Richard Armitage, Vice-Chancellor 
for Student Affairs, says that one "can 
insure for a mistake ," but thinks that the 
students at UCSD "would not be stupid 
on the single coverage, but adds that he 
thinks the benefit is "enough. " 

Ava Torre-Bueno of Pla nn d 
Parenthood in San Diego says an 
abortion during the first 12 weeks of 
pregnancy costs $ tOO, wittl some 
doctors charging $80 for an abortion 
through the first 8 weeks. From there, 
the costs increase with the gestation 
period. Delivery through the Alternative 
Birth Center at University Hospital cost 

475, which includes childbirth training, 
labor and delivery. Torre-Bueno 
es timates tha t prenatal care and delivery 
through a private doctor may cost two to 
three thousand dollars. 

Fifty-nine protestors from several UC 
campuses are re fu sing to pay 
registration fees because the fees fund 
a bortions. A one-month trial has been 
set for June , 1980 against Blue Cross 
and American National insurance 
companies. Until that time, these 
students have their reg fees in a court 

, trust , which is now around $12,000. 
Albin Rhomberg , one of the original 

protestors, opposes the use of reg fees

'More Efficient' Computer 
Takes 6 Weeks to Work 

by Jenifer Warren 
The UCSD Burrough. 7800 compu-

ter is "back on line and ruMing magnifi-
cently" after a delay of six weeks, Ed 
Coughran, Director of Computer Sys-
tems, said yesterday. . 

Faulty wiring and imperfect pieces in 
the computer which replaced the "less 
efficient" 6700 this fali, resulted in spo-
radic functioning and errors every 20 
million operations. All systems using the 
computer, ranging from graduate school 
admissions to research projects such as 
deep sea drilling, were set back by the 
malfunction. 

Perhaps most severely affected by the 
shut-down was payroll operations. Accor-
ding to Don Suycott, supervisor of the

version to the 7800 took place, to Aug. 
28, the payroll department was unable 
to feed information into the computer. 
Thus material could not be prepared for 
UCLA, where faculty checks are actu-
ally produced. On the 28th, the depart-
ment was granted limited use of the 
computer system at Carlsbad, but not 
before a serious snafu was created. 

More than 800 forms had not been 
entered into the computer, including 
terminations of professors and changes 
in salaries. As a result, the computer 
staff says, delays in payment and incor-
rt'ct distribution of sa lCiries occurred. 

Literature professor Thomas Dunseath 
reportedly received only 70 percent of 
his salary, while an unnamed profes or 
received 140 percent of his . 

"We wrote over 250-300 local checks 
right here," said Suycott, adding thai 
nearly 3 percent of the total UCSD 
faculty wa affected by the shut-down, 
where payroll alone was concerned.

Odd-Even Plan Ends 
In County Board Vote 
Approval by Governor Expected Soon 

By Kathy Huffer 
Associate New Editor 

Gas rationing is d ad in an Diego 
Ollnty aft r a ounty Board of 

Sup rvisors vote yes terday to lift 
restri ·tions on gas sales. 

In a four to one vote, the Board 
deci d d to di 'continue the odd-even 
gas plan despite warnings that ctober 
will bring additional demand for gas 

,and pos-;ibly a return of lines at 
stations. 

Their de ision wi ll not take effect 
until a t least tomorrow, when Gov. 
Brown s expected to give the a pproval 
required to enforce the Board's 
decision. 

Th vote was not a urprise to 
county off icials, sin e the Board began 
publicizing Its opposition to the 
emergency plan several weeks ago. 
The d 'ision yesterday was mad 
quickly. 

Gas lines warned 
At odds with the re t of the Board 

members was upervisor Rog r 
Hedgeco ok, who said befor the vote 
that release from the gas plan" eems 
to invite the long lines again." 

iting a re ent r porI which warns 
that gas con umption will increas this 
month , Hedgeco k asked the Board to 
hold off discontinuance of th odd-ev n 
plan for two weeks, until memb rs had 
a chane to observe October gas sales. 

Th report, the "Lundberg Letter ," 
describes October as a month 
"histori 'ally strong in gasoline ales," 
and warns against premature ending of 
emerg ncy gas m asures. Although 
September gas sales were down from 
last year, "October could come as a 
cold shock" to gas consumers, th 
report -ays. 

BociYd Chairman Tom Hamilton 

responded to Hedg cock 's warning, 
saying that drivers have become more 
aware of gas shortages and have 
reduced ga ' consumption a' a result. 
" I'd lik to see if people will continue to 
act in thi mann r ," he remarked, 

Board member - stressed that if gas 
lines return,odd- ven res tri -tions would 
be reinstated immediately, pending 
approval from Brown. In his telegram, 
Brown said he will "act expeditiou -Iy" 
upon a r quest for reinstatement of Ihe 
gas plan. 

But Hedgecock warned against 
such a measure, saying that the Board 
"'an only cry wolf once." If the 
odd-even sys tem is implemented again, 
drivers will probably ignore the 
restrictions, he said. 

If an Diego ounty returns to the 
rationing system, "I'll be very, very 
,reluctant to drop it until the Governor 
drops it," Hamilton 'omm nted,

IntraDlurals Set Record 
By Turning Down 300 

-

By Jon Goetz 
Sports Editor 

Over 300 prospective athletes from 
three sports have been turned away by 
the overburdened intramural program 
because of a lack of funds to referee any 
more games. 

So far, 21 flag football teams, seven 
volleyball tea ms, and six inner tube 
water polo teams have put their names 
on waiting lists, hoping to take the spot 
of a team that forfeits a game. Ever since 
the initial signup, captains ha ve been 
walking into the intramural office with 
team rosters in hand , but no pace is 
avai lable for them. 

This fall quarter marks a critical point 
for th intramural program, though it is 
not the firsl quart r that they have had to 
exclude teams. Last fall 20 footba ll 
tams n ver got to play. 

Ev n more people want to play Ihis 
yeur, yet an increas in th budget 
was killed by the Re~ Fee ommittee.No 
more refer scan h hired to offi -iate 
extra games under the curren t budget. 

ampus Recreation officials feel 
trapped by the growing popularit of 
intramureJs on the on hand and th la 'k 
of money on the other. "How can you

program. 

"If we're really interested in retaining 
students here, we have to keep popular 
programs ," said Cales. Intramurals has 
more students parlicipating for il than 
any other program on campus . 

A sports assistant employed by 
Recrea tion , Andy Berg, will go before 
the AS with a bill a king for more money 
for the program, tonight. Campu ' 
R creation al'o put in a r quest to Vi e-
Chancellor Richard Armitag to obtain

Education by Voucher: Fixall or Fraud? 
By Rasa GUltaitil 

Professor John Coons 
pauses for a minute between 
the insistent ringing of his 
office telephone at UC 
Berkeley's BoaJt Law School. 
"I'm going crazy answering 
the phone," he complains, 
responding to inquiries about 
the school voucher initiative he 
co·aut hored with his

With school strikes this fall 
now involVing 40.00 teachers 
and nearly 800,000 students 
in 12 ltates, the move toward 
alternative ed.ucation is likely 
to continue to grow. The 
voucher plan. which backers 
hope to place on the June, 
1980, bafIot in California as a 

movement," Coons said. 
"Who knows whether we will 
get it together. I'm trying to 
leach law full time. But there is 
a mob of people wanting to 
work for it." 

Local interest in the plan is 
particularly intense in San 
Francisco, where striking 
teachers are picketing 72 
public elementary schools the 
district has defiantly opened 
using $90·a·day substitutes. 

But Coons is getting 
numerous speaking invitations 
from groups around the 
country, and President Carter

Wer~ a study made to find 
way. to alleviate the alienating 
atmosphere here, keeping a 
place like the Coffee Hult 
would be one remedy 
.. gested. 

I find it hard to believe that 
after more · than a decade of 
operation it is now financially 
unfeasible. That's just an 
argument of convenience for 
grasping bureaucrats .. first 
McElroy and now AS 
President Carlos Montalvo. 

I've read how the new "pub" 
is supposed to accommodate 
the Hut's clientele. But that's 
impossible ... it isn't big enough 
and the menu's far too limited: 

On the subject of the "pub." 
which now offers us beer at a 
time when most beer have 
been found to contain potent 
carcignogens, I noticed an 
interesting item . in the 
Disorientation Manual. In 
1975 students voted 1942 to 
486 in favor of an organic. 
vegetarian restaurant in that 
space. So for two years we had 
Future Foods. a half·baked. 
expensive "natural" food 
service. And now we have a 
greasepit. where you can't 
even get a cheese sandwich. 
\Vhy can't we at least have a 
place offering non·carnivores 
a decent choice of sand· 
wiches? 

It· s not too late for students 
to do something about both the 
Hut and the "pub." I hope 
there are some honorable 
people in the AS who will do 
something and that students in 
general will organize against 
this idiotic outrage. 

Chris O'Connell 

commented the Rev. Roger 
Coughlin, a Catholic 
community activist in Chicago 
and a supporter of voucher 
system. "The issue isn't 
understood. And lots of places 
will wait to see how they do in 
California. " 

Denis Doyle, a fellow at the 
Brookings Institution in 
Washington, D.C. who is 
writing a book on the voucher 
concept, said "There is a 
tendency here on the Eastern 
seaboard to assume that the 
future arrives about two years 
early in Califomia." 

Teachers unions, school 
officials and lOme parent 
groupa believe that the plan 
would destroy democracy in 
public schools, lead to a 
pro~feration of bureacracy 

and shrink the resources 
available to children through 
public education. "The end 
result would be a system which 
would be completely 
fragmented along class lines," 
according to Robert Alioto. 
superintendent of schools in 
San Francisco. 

"It's a fraud being 
perpetrated on the public." 
said Sally Brunn. a San 
Francisco parent who was 
active in trying to get more 
funds from the state for the 
city's schools last spring. 
"People feel they can get the 
kind of education they want. 
with transportation and 
adequate pay for teachen. 
with vouchers. But I think that 
would be difficult to do. 
Transportation to just the 10 

alternative schools in the city 
right now costs a half million 
dollars a year." . 

Supporters argue. however. 
that the voucher plan would 
expand options and for the first 
time economic clout. to poor 
and minority parents. "I see it 
as the one thing that wuld 
empower the parents of 
minority children." said 
Coughlin. 

Benjamin Foster of 
Hartford. Conn.. a recent 
fellow in George Washington 
University's Institute for 
Educational Leadership, 
agrees. "A ' parent who 
disapproves of his child's 
school would have the option 
of the customer who can take , 
his business elsewhere." he

Closing Nuclear Reactors May 
Cost as Much as Building ' Them 

By David Piper 

What will we do with 
deactivated reactors. and who 
will pay for doing it? 

All of them will become . 
obsolete power siations after a 
lifetime of 30 to 40 years 
because the expense. of 

David Piper. an employee 
01 the UCSD grounds 
department and a part·time 
student at Mesa College. is the 
campus representative o{ the 
Community Energy Action 

Networ/~. 
retreading the outdated. highly 
radioactive reactor vessel and 
returning it to active use could 
exceed the original construc· 
tion costs. 

Decommissioning. like the 
problem of disposing of 
nuclear wastes. remains 
unsolved w~ile the pressure 
generated by an expanding 
inventory of nuclear plants 
continues to build. 

So far 11 licensed nuclear 
po~er plants and test reactors 
have been shut down and 
dismantled or placed in 
protective storage. Where the 
reactor has been not only shut 
down but dismantled and 
carted away from the site. as 
with Minnesota's Elk River 
Reactor. the decommissioning 
costs have run as high as the 
original construction costs. 

Because the estimated 
expenses of decommissioning 
today's 1100·megawatt 
reactors are so high and open· 
ended. it is important to 
resolve questions of cost 
before the commitments to 
nudea r· powl!red electrici ty 

exceeds society's ability to pay 
for its cleanup. 

No reactor beyond 100 
megawatts has ever been 
decommissioned. and despite 
glib assurances from the NRC. 
no one has the slightest idea of 
how to decommission 1100-
meJ!"awatt reactors. 

There are three ways to do it 
theoretically. but each has 
tremendous disadvantages. If 
the utility is not able to do so, 
then it would require vast 
increases in electric rates. 
special taxes on the public. or 
the U.S. Government would 
have to pay for it. With the 
present construction schedules 
we will have over 100 reactors 
to decommission before 2025. 

Il.is anticipated that some of 
these reaelors will become 
inoperable sooner because of 
metal fatigue. corrosion. 
radiation and the impossibility 
of replacement of vital parts in 
inaccessible places because of 
excess radiation. It is obvious 
that to decommission these 
100 reactors by the year 
2025. or thereafter. in exces!! 
of $100,000,000,000 (in 

depreciated dollars of the year 
2025) will be required. 

We need to know who will 
pay the millions of dollanl 
needed 'to decontaminate each 
facility and maintain 
continuous surveillance. and 
the eventual dismantling and 
removal of the facility : 
. In Clinton. Tenn., for 

instance, the manufacturer of 
sealed radioactive sources 
abandoned a plant site in mid· 
1971. leaving a significantly 
contaminated area. The cost of 
decontamination fell. by 
default, upon the federal and 
state governments. Similarly. 
in 1972, Nuclear Fuel 
Services. Inc., shut down its 
commercial reprocessing plant 
in West Valley. New York. 

Four years later. the plant 
owners transferred control of 
the site to the New York State 
Energy Research and 
Development Authority. 
placing a great financial 
burden upon the state. The 
costs for decommissioning the 
West Valley site are estimated 
at as high as $600 million.

MOSCOW - The Soviet Union, faced by serious 

labor shortages and a need to support millions of 
old·age pensioners, announced new measures yester· 
day to encourage older citizens to keep working. 

The current retirement age in most jobs is 60 years 
for men and 55 for women. But limited numbers of 
pensioners have long been a common sight in Soviet 
offices, transport services and factories, working to 
avoid boredom or to supplement pension income. 

Seeking to increase this number, the decree

Cuba Still an Issue Another Bakke? 

WASHINGTON - Republican leaders in the 
Senate said yesterday the SAL T II treaty cannot be 
ratified now, partly because they claim President 
Carter has failed to separate the pact from the 
continuing furor over Soviet combat troops in Cuba. 

But the Senate's Democratic leadership said it still 
backs the treaty, saying Carter has succeeded in 
demon.trating that the presence of 2,600 soldiers in 
Cuba in no way overshadows the importance of a 
treaty to control lite race in nuclear arms.

Construction Detours 
Third , Warren Mail 

By Wendy Wolf 
Some 580 students ha'/e had their mail sent all over the 

I:ampus in the confus ion ca used by the delayed construction 
of post office boxes for the rel:ently uuilt Third and Warren 
College apartments . 

Because of a delay in the delivery of the boxes, new 
<:Ipartme nt residents at Third a nd Warren Colleges have had 
to pick up their mail at different locations. 

And the initial overflow of mail at the post office on Revelle 
campus was furth r complica ted by a shortage of workers, 
according to Senior Mail Processor Jean Milles . 

he said steps were being ta ken to avoid students having to 
come across campus to get their mail. 

Currently, Third College students are picking up a ll mail at 
Third 's resident dean 's office, while a makeShift post office 
has b n set up lor those at Warren in the college 's recreation 
room, Miles said. 

Third College Resident Dean Yolanda Trevino estimated 
that at least 25 pieces of mail are received daily at the office. 

She said this occurred once belore in 1975, when the post 
office box construction was also delayed for the original Third 
College apartment. 

Milles said she initially sent the Warren College mail to the 
College's resident dean's office , but it was returned . 

Warren Assista nt Resident Dean Diane Vinky said she 
could not estimate how much mail was being received. 

Through a "combined effort of the postal service and 
residen t halls" Rich Bermudez, a Warren student, was hired 
to hand out mail daily in 'the Warren recreation room , she 
said . 

Some Warren students complained of being 
"inconvenienced" by the arrangement, however, because 
they say they weren' t told by the college where to get their 
mail. 

The post office boxes are expected to be installed at both 
co lleges by late October. 

Campus architect Don McCarty said the post office boxes 
were not included in the Third apartment building contract 
because I:ampus planners were waiting for "a contrador to 
suhmit an acceptable product. " 

He said the Warren apartments contract includes 
provisions for the post office boxes, but "the lounge area 
where they are to be installed is unfini shed ." The con tractor is 
concentrating on completing the living units first . McCarty

UC Extension Investigated 
For Racial Discrintination 

BERKELEY - Public hear-
ings will be held next month by 
a University of California fact-
finding committee investigating 
allegations of patterns of racial 
discrimination in UC's Co-
operative Extension Service. 

The hearings are scheduled 
for May 1 in Sacramento, 
May 4 in Riverside and May 5 
in Fresno. 

UC President David Saxon 
appointed the committee in 
March to review Cooperative 
Extension's affirmative action 
personnel program and services 
provided to minority communi-
ties . The review will include an 
analysis of the administration 
and effectiveness of these mat-
ters . 

Walter Strong, UC Assistant 
Vice President for Personnel 
Development and Affirmative 
Action, is committee chairman. 
The group hopes to make its 
report to President Saxon by 
May 15. 

The committee is seeking 
testimony on general area., 
including: 

eWhat the impact of the 
specific Cooperative Extension-
programs and services that are 
designed to meet the minority 
communities has been. 

eWhat are some practical 
and realistic ways in which 
Cooperative Extension can im-
prove services to minority com· 
munities? 

eWhich factors and systemic 
issues have created the percep-

tion on the part of some that 
there exists racial discrimination 
with respect to personnel manage-
ment in Cooperative Extension? 

-Are there changes that 
should be made in policy. proce-
dures, administrative structure 
ann function to improve the 
effectiveness of Cooperative 
Extension's Affirmative Action 
personnel program? 

Committee members include 
Strong; Associate Professor-
Edison Cabacungan of Califor-
nia State Polytechnic CoUelle, 
Pomona ; Vice-C hancellor 
Eugene Cota·Robles of UC 
Santa Cruz; former Regent 
Carol Mock of UC Berkeley; 
Law Professor Sho Sato of UC 
Berkeley; Emeritus Professor 
Herman Spieth of UC Davis. 

Rescheduling of Finals 
Draws CEP Reproof . 

The Committee on Educational Policy has sent out a memo 
reminding faculty of the statewide regulation requiting a ll 
undergraduate courses to give finals during the scheduled exam 
period a nd have any exceptions approved. 

Tom Bond, chairman of CEP, says the committee was told of 
problems arising last year when students were "coerced" into 
changing scheduled times for fina ls because it was more 
convenient for the professor. Bond says CEP policy states that 
every student has a right to keep his final at the originally 
scheduled time. 

" If final exams are to be changed t hen the final has to also be 
offered at the regularly scheduled time," stated Bond. "If the 
professor agrees to change the time, in essence, he is agreeing to 
give two finals." 

Although it is possible to change the exam time when the 
entire class and faculty are in agreement, Bond commented that, 
"finals are only to be given during finals week, and they are not 
to be given in the 10th week of class or on dead day." 

CEP hopes to not have to do any more than just remind 
professors of the problem: Need tor shict enlorcement IS not 
foreseen a nd therefore will not be considered until it arises. 

Bond added that the reminder was only an attempt to ease 
academic confl icts, not create them. 

Department Chairmen are not anticipating any problems 
ei ther. Patty McPhearson, in charge of finals scheduling in the 
Biology Department, stated that any changes this year will have 
to go through various channels to be approved, and therefore 
di//iculties should be minimal.

CAPE Carries Ads, 
May Combine Qtrs. 

By L.A. Grant 
CAPE's quarterly publication evaluating UCSD teaching will 

carry advertisements for the first time ever this year, because 
"We're having a little trouble staying within our budget," said 
David Voth, an editor at CAPE. 

CAPE (Course and Professor Evaluations) is a student·run · 
organization that canvasses the campus once a quarter to find 
out how the students grade their instructors. 

The tight budget may lead to more ch~nges. Kate Sullivan, 
CAPE director, said the number of evaluations may be reduced 
from three a year to two, Winter and Spring publications would 
be combined. Sullivan said other UC campuses now conduct 
evaluations less often 'than UCSD. 

Voth also cited precedents within the UC for the 
advertisements. 

"Santa Cruz puts out a publication like this, and it's just full of 
ads," he said. 

Sullivan also claims the money and time made available by 
consolidating would allow a better end.product. 

With a staff of six to eight steady employees and from twenty 
to twenty·five part·time workers, CAPE compiles information in 
nearly every classroom on campus. There they pass out 
computer·read questionnaires containing questions such as 
"Does the professor .stimulate your intellectual curiosity?" or 
"Does the professor come well.prepared? .. explain clearly?" 
Space for mdividual comment is also given. 

Once each individual class is evaluated, the data from all 
classes is compiled into a booklet for distribution . 

Accordin to Sullivan, CAPE information is intended primarily 
for use by students. While the information is used to some extent 
by the different departments, Sullivan says, the information is 
intended to allow students to make more informed cou~se 
choices. • 

When contacted several department offices responded that 
the information is added to each professor's individual file, but 
beyond that each department had a different opinion of CA ~E 
and its value. 

Dr. Donald Bear of the Economics Department, stated that 
while the informatioD may be consulted when course 
assignments for the iaculty are being made, very little other 
attention is paid the evaluations. 

The Physics Department, on the other hand, considers the 
information essential, according to Bonnie Horstmann. The 
evaluations are typed verba tum and presented to the 
department chairman who reviews them before each professor 
sees his particular evalution. Additionally , the physics 
department has its own evaluation for several courses and labs 
not covered by t~e CAPE report. 

In the · Drama Department, CAPE is considered of little 
impartance compared to other factors used bv the department. 
The primary complaint is that CAPE does not ask questions 
specific enough lor the purposes 01 the department. 10 make up 
for this the Drama Department has its own evaluation system for 
its courses that answers more fully the questions asked. 

The opinions of these three departments do not form a trend, 
nor are they conclusive in demonstrating CAPE's effect on the 
professor evaluated. What is d.,monstrated is tha t some sort of 
input is available to some departments by those students who 
participate in the CAPE process. . 

CAPE booklets can be obtained at the CAPE offi ce. 10 'ated 
on the north side of the Humanities· Library Building in the 
basement.

Even After Protests, Reg Fees 
Pay $1 00 in Abortion Coverage 

Continued from page 1 
for abortions beca us e 
"abortioft on demand is not 
part of education." And, he 
claims this year's policy is 
discr iminatory . 

"Why can't a man go in (to 
the health center) and receive 
payment for his ' girlfriend at 
home? All students pay reg 
fees. " 

Rhomberg says that the 

Computer

"LucJ(ily , most employees

position." 

Now that the Burroughs 
7800 is functioning properly,

improvement over its 
predecessor, • the staff ays. 
Accommodating as many as 
258 possible users at one time, 
the computer runs seven days 
a week, 24 hours a day. More

present policy makes child 
bearing entirely a "woman's 
~uty" and leaves the man with 

no responsibility at all. "There 
is no consideration that he pay 
for the abortion; the burden is 
placed on fellow students." 
Furth.er , he sees th e 
philosophical question (of 
deciding the fate of the fetus) 
becomin g e ntirely the 
woman's decision. 

·At UCLA, students may 
buy the optional insuranc~ 

plan for $99.50 per year, 
\ 'hich offers benefits for 
pregnancy, says Amy 
Goldman of Social Services 
there. This plan covers up to 
$220 in professiona l fees, and 
$110 in auxiliary services for 
an abortion. If th student 
requires hospitalization, the 
insurance will pay up to $440. 
A delivery will also be paid up 
to $44(1. No funds come out of 
reg fee for these services, 
Goldman adds. 

Congress Shelves Ban On 
Reg Fee Paid Abortions 

Amendments that would have terminated federal funds to 
universities if abortion coverage were included in students' 
mandatory registration fees were removed from the Depart· 
ment of Education bill last week. 

Congressional aides say debates on the amendments 
would have held back the passage of the bill which passed 
Congress Friday. . 

Congress is curently tied up over abortion coverage in the 
medicare program. The bill, which would affect students 
eligible for MediCal, is tied up in conference committee. The 
Senate approves abortion coverage for medically necessary 
abortions and rape and incest victims 
while the House approves funding for medically necessary 
abortions only.

Space Telescope Controls Sent 
Elsewhere, But UCSD Involved 

By Li .. Pieropan 
A NASA space telescope, 

to be placed in orbit about the 
earth in 1983, will not have its 
control center located at 
UCSD as local scientists had 
hoped, but will carry on board 
an instrument designed and 
built by scientists here. 

Acc ording to· Dr . E. 
Margaret Burbidge , professor 
of Astrophy s ic s , NASA 
officials have narrowed the list 
of candidates for the control 
center locale, eliminating 
UCSD in the process. 

A site near Scripps ha d 
formerly been considered by 
NASA as a possible location. 

The instrument carried 
aboard the space telescope is a 
Faint Object Spectrograph. 
According to Burbidge, the 
spectrograph will gather 
ultraviolet , x-ray, and infrared 
frequenr-ies of radtation in 
order to mealure the distances 
to remote stellar objects. 

Situated above the 
atmosphere, the telescope and 
the spectrograph will be in a

postion to ~void the "curtain 
effec t " of the earth' s 
atmosphere, which blocks out 
certain frequ~ncies of light , 
creates air turbulence and 
reflects "light pollution" from 
city lights . 

The spac e teles c op e 
project, costing over half a 
billion dollars, will be used to 
observe the activities of the 
Milky Way, as well as 
nei ghboring gal a xies . The 
faint object spectrogra ph will 
be used to determine the rate 
at which the galaxy IS 
expanding . 

A ccording to Burbidge, 
de termining the rate a t which 
di stant objec ts a re moving 
involve s m e a s uring the ir 
emitted. wa vele ng ths to see if 
each wave has stretched from 
crest to crest. Such stretc hing 
makes visible light appear 
more red, inspiring the 
common name for the effect, 
"the red shift." 

The greater its red shift, the 
faster an object is moving 
away from us . Using these 

calculations, the rate of 
movement approaches nine-
tenths of the speed of light. 

In addition , the spectro-
gra ph will be used to compare 
the ra nge shift s of close r a nd

spec trogra ph will a lso provide

Burbidge, UCS D was only 
elimina ted from cons ide ra tion 
for the te lescope's conlrol

becoming a wes tern sub-
station .

Third of 'Nemperors' Released 

Wide-Eyed Andy · Pratt A Paradox 
By Barry AIOIIIO 

Contribut!nf Editor 
On one hand, It's natural to 

wonder why Andy Prall hun't 
had more succell as a 
singer/songwriter since he 
began releasing albums eight 

Resolution (1976) ana Shiver 
In The Nigh' (1977), were 
produced by Arif Mafdin, a 
record industry heavyweight 
who tried to give Pratt's music a 
more commercial bent. 

Resolu'io~ especially boasted

nowhere/ And I'm in shock") 
that are saved by Pratt's flipped. 
out upper-register vocals (by 
expert word-slurring he 
manages to rhyme "clause" and 
"dollars" - no kidding). Pratt's 
unorthodox singing style is 
perhaps his strongest asset: 
Gifted with a rare range and 
imaginative enough to use it in 
bizarre ways, he can vocally 
leap from a guttural growl to a 
piercing shriek with ease. 

Though the a lbum definitely 
has its moments if silliness (the 
la-las during "King In Beggar's 
Clothing" are thoroughly 
juvenile), Pratt displays a 
deadly serious approach to love 
and spirituality in many of 
Motives' songs. If he wasn't so 

sincere in his delivery, his 
paeans to angelic sweethearts 
("Christine") and expressions of 
religious faith ("Savior," "Cross 
On A Hill") would be difficult at 
times to handle. It's Pratt's 
talent to take cliched themes 
and tum them into something 
wonderfully personal. His 
Christian.inspired. songs here 
are' far more uplifting that Bob 
Dylan's similar treatments of 
sacred subjects on his new LP 
SloUJ Train Coming. 

While the ' stirring string and 
horn charts Mardin contribute<! 
to Pratt's last two albums are 
absent from Motives, the 
arrangements this time still glow 
with sentimentality, good cheer 
and even a little funkiness. 
"Love Insurance" is pepped up 

by Phillipe Saisse's spritely 
minimoog, while Tony Levin's 
bass percolates nicely during 
"King In Beggar's Clothing." 
"Sing" proyes that a MOR song 
can still ha ve vigor, hurried 
along by Pratt's own jazzy 
piano. Rising above all of the 
instrumentation is the singer's 
vocal ' presence, plaintive, 
giddy, reassuring, convincing 
even when excessive . 

I'm afraid that, despite IS 
musical expertise, Andy i;lratt 
may be too loving and innocent 
of heart to be a top artist in this 
cynical era. Hell, even if he's 
really a selfish bas tard like most 
of us , I still prefer to think of him 
as a starry-eyed kid. That's 
what makes him special.

and psychology, and then 
places them into an 
environment where they just 
don't know how to function. At 
one point, Detective John 
Clifford (Charles Durning) 
tells his connection on the 
police force, Lt. Charlie 
Garber (Ron O ' Neal), that 
when he finds the killer he's 
going to kill him rather than 
bring him back to jail. Garber, 
after very little argument, 
gives in to the idea saying to 
Clifford, "but do it good." 

As implausible as the plot'of 
this movie is, with the excep· 
tion of the first scene which did 

actually happen, director Fred 
Walton manages to pull taut 
that thread between film and 
audience, bringing us to the 
edge of our seats. He pulls it 
hard, never being too explicit, 
probing our imaginations, 
finding our nightmares. He 
takes us up the rollercoaster 
without giving a clue to what's 
on the other side. He leads us 
blindly in the dark to the door 
that someone left ajar .. 
someone other than ourselves 

With a more reasonabl~ 
and cre<!ible story this film 
would be a classic thriller. The 
innuendo 01 every camera 
angle is quite frightening The 

utilization of downtown 
locations, sets an impressive 
background. The musicm, 
though sometimes Jaws· 
esque, sometimes Exorcist· 
esque, helps move an anxious 
audience further off the theater 
seats. But for all Ihis work, I 
can't help noticing small spots 
here and there, where the film 
plods along with no more 
genuine enthusiasm than a 
middle·aged man in Hallo· 
ween. costume asking for 

candy in July . It's a damn 
shame too. A thoroughbred 
horse with f{reat legs--and a 
pol belly.

'Scent of a Woman' Smothers Acting 
By Beth Haas 

The tradition of excellence 
'in fine Italian wines and Fiats 
sadly does not quite carryover 
into the rec ntly released 
film,Sce nt o f a Wuman, 
produ ed by Dino Rissi . 
Inevitably , the film has its 
entertaining scenes, hut it is 
smo thered under the subtitles 
and obviolls, ov e rused 
humor. 

The plot, if it may be called 
tha t, simply consists 01 tne 
adv.entures of a retired army 
colonel, a 'cidenta ll y blinded 
during practi'e manuevers, 
and a young army private, 
who are making their way to 
Naples via Genoa and Rome. 
The Colonel, able to perceive 
woman 's ' presence simply by 
her fragrance, is artfully 
portray e d by Vittorio 
Gassman . In fact, his 
outstanding performance as a 
vulgar, crass, yet captiva ting 
and sensitive man won him the 
prestigious Best Actor award 
at the Cannes Film Festival. 

The supporting actress, 
Agostina Belli·, poignantly 
portrays the beautiful, 18· 
year·old woman who has bee" 
infatuated with the Colonel for 
years. The Colonel and his 

• companion, Ciccis, finally 
meet up with her in Naples , 
but, unfortunately, the 
audience never knows why 
they went there in the first 
place. Belli, nevertheless, does 
a magnificent job depicting a 
young girl struggling with her 
maturity, her womanhood, 
and her fe e lin~s for tht'

his role. Together, though

rowdy womanizer. Gassman 
does not mince words when it 
'omes to his female conquest . 

" Remember where she (the 
prostitute) was , Ciccio.l'm not 
horny enoug h today. " 
Frequent comments such as 
this embarrass the pitiful, 
innocent private but also teach 
him a lillie. more about the 
fl avor of life. 

The poor, simple, tired 
dialogue of Scent of a Woman 
does most to weaken the film. 
Sure, it is hilarious in some 
parts, and in others it almost 
brings tears to the eyes, but 
after a while, it becomes 
glaringly evident that most of 

what is said is borrowed from 
scenes in other movies. 
Gassman and Belli, overflow· 
ing with talent and keen 
insigh t, greatly enrich the 
mediocre dialogue. 

lbe su btitles undoubtedly 
allect the conversations ; it is 
doubtful. though, that the film 
would take on any more 
meaning if the general 
American audiences under· 
stood Italian. Lines such as 
"Oh, I see that I did," from the 
colones make people laugh, 
but they have been employed 
too many times in other blind 
man scenes to be sharp, lively 
humor. 

Two eminent interpre ters of modern piano literature, Karie and 
Margaret Kohn , pay tribute to French composer , Olivier 
Messiaen's 70th birthday in a peformance of his powerful song 
cycle, Visions de l 'A men , Friday, Oct. 5,8 pm, in the Mandeville 
Auditorium. Messiaen's music moves around the ' polls; the 
heologicaltruths of the Cathlic faith, the great themes of love, and 

the great truths of nature. It reflects the deep involvement with 
Gregori an chants, scales, and rythms of Indian music, the 
rarmonic language of Debussy and Ravel, as well as a passion for 
birds and their songs. 

Fix Your Head Here 
Visions, a peice that 's a spiritual and mystical in concept , was 

' omposed after Messiaen's repatriation from a German 
oncentration camp in 1943. It expresses his profound re ligious 

belief, which the compose considers the most significant aspect of 
~is art. 

Karle and Margaret Kohn have performed widely, both here 
~nd overseas. Their programs emphasize modern literature for 
two pianos, and for piano for two players. Their achievements 
ange from the first US performance of Structures, Livre,

First Step to Soccer Playoffs Saturday 
By Time Liotta 

The UCSD soccer team 
begins their quest for an NA IA 
playoff berth this Saturday 
when they meet laVerne 
College on Muir Field. They 
wiJl be balliing nine schools for 
four playoff spots . The 
Tritons, fresh from a strong 
performance at the AII·CaI 
Tourney, must be optimistic 
about their chances. 

Last Friday the Tritons 
stepped off the plane to put in a 
sterling defensive effort 
against UC Berkeley only to 
lose }·O. Later that afternoon 
the Tritons finally got rolling, 
shutting out UC Santa Cruz 
2·0. Glen Calta and Tobin 
So.nick flelled their first goals 
fo the season, pacing the 
Triton offense. 

The Tritons returned to the 
field Saturday morning only to 
be soundly defeated by UCLA 
3·0. The Tritons bounced 
back to defeat UC Riverside 3· 
2 later that afternoon. 

It was the most productive 
afternoon for the UCSD 

offense this season, as five 
different players found the net. 
Jon Gold tallied his second 
goal 01 the season on a penalty 
kick . Sam Tam scored off of a 
direct kick Irom Bill Bullock 
and Peter Matz capped off the 
Triton allack with his first I 

01 the year when he directed in 
a Toby Sosnick corner kick . 

The Tritons went into the 
toruney with a solid delense . 
What the Tritons had been 
lacking until this weekend was 
a scoring punch. They had 

only scored twice in thei r lirst 
four games. 

The UCSD squad has been 
able tp set up the scoring 
attacks only to come up shorl 
on most occasions. At the All· 
Cal Tourney the results were

Looking over the lirst lour

had been ambitiOLis . llley've

team's only victory prior to

able to overcome a number of 
letdowns and mental mistakes 
to score a 2· 1 win .

Local interviews 
for software professionals 
The pu,pose of eve,y Wang product ;s the' same: 
to enhance pt'od~tlv;ty . 

At Wang Laboratories, we make computer and word processi ng systems. 
But we're really not in the computer or word processing business. 

Our business II producUvity. And that's a peopte business.

Maybe 'all this sounds obvious. But you'd be surprised how many com-
puter and word proce.sing manufacturers fOfget that the end users of 
t .... ir productl ar. people. 

At Wang, .. ·never forget. 

That's why our products are simpler to use th.an theirs. And more 
efficient. · · 

.And that's why we're growing faster than anybody else in the business. 
. 

And that's why we're interested in Bachelor's, Master's or PhD 
candidates. ' I " . I'. . • I 

Located in Lowell, Massachusetts, we offer. e)(cellent sa'laries and 
benefits including full relocation, profit sharing, stock purchase plan,

of the Greater Boston area; and perhaps most important, an enviable 
standard of living within the rea~h of the software professional.

civilization which offers to

voucher plan with strict 
provisions to allure that there 
is no discrimination against

stipulate thal voucher schools

the voucher. though they 
would remain free to leek
