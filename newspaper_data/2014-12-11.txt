California State Senate Proposes 
Plan to Take Over UC System

In the wake of the UC Board of Regents’ controversial 
five-year tuition hike, two California State senators intro-
duced a constitutional amendment on Thursday, Dec. 
4 which would return control of the UC system to the 
state legislature if passed. Dubbed SCA-1, the proposed 
legislation would need a two-thirds majority approval of 
both the State Assembly and Senate before being placed 
on the 2016 ballot.

SCA-1 is the bipartisan brainchild of Sen. Ricardo Lara 
(D-Bell Gardens) and Sen. Anthony Cannella (R-Ceres). 
While the amendment does not list specific powers, it 
would empower the California Legislature to oversee all 
necessary UC regent decisions if passed. For example, it 
could create laws that veto tuition increases or chancellor 
pay hikes, among other things. 

“At a time when access, affordability and diversity are 
in question, we should allow the public to have a direct 
say in how its public university system operates,” Lara said 
in his statement.

SCA-1 would end the UC system’s historic indepen-
dence from state control — which has continued for over 
100 years — and implement a system more similar to how 
California State Universities are run. A similar measure 
was created by former Sen. Leland Yee in 2009, although 
it failed to win Senate approval.

“This constitutional amendment will accomplish 
[accountability] without interfering with the daily opera-
tions of the UC system,” Cannella added in Lara’s state-
ment. “The students working hard to earn a degree and 
the families that support many of them deserve no less 
than a university system that utilizes its funding judi-
ciously.” 

However, SCA-1 is not without controversy. It has 
attracted the favor of some parties, like UC Berkeley’s A.S. 
Council, but has drawn sharp rebukes from the UC Office 
of the President.

Assembly and with the administration about how we

A.S. Council Engineering Senator 
Salman Alrashed resigned from his 
position Friday, Dec. 5, citing personal 
reasons for his departure. At the time 
of his resignation, a motion was in 
place for Alrashed’s impeachment on 
the basis of attendance issues. 

Alrashed, a Warren College senior 
and mechanical engineering student, 
was elected in Spring Quarter 2014 
with the Tritons Forward slate. As 
Engineering Senator, Alrashed was one 
of the five Academic Senators — all 
voting members — on A.S. Council. 
His term would have carried him 
through the 2014–15 academic school 
year had he not resigned. 

Following his resignation, Alrashed 
sent an email to the other members of 
the council saying, “My personal life, 
professional life and the nature of my 
academic rigor are in the way of my 
position, and I wouldn’t be doing right 
by all of you hard-working individuals 
if I stayed.”

Alrashed further elaborated in an 
interview with the UCSD Guardian on 
why he did not feel he was able to fulfill 
his obligations as a voting member of 
A.S. Council.

“I ran so that I could do things 
specific to the engineering community,” 
Alrashed told the Guardian. “But a lot 
of the time, we would be voting on 
things that didn’t pertain to that, and 
I didn’t feel it was fair for me to stay 
without being able to take sides.»

Alrashed sent in his formal resigna-
tion after accruing a total of five unex-
cused absences. 

The Standing Rules of the A.S. 
Council currently state that each vot-
ing member must attend all council 
meetings, all A.S. Senate meetings, all 
meetings of their committees and all 
mandatory events as specified by the 
A.S. President. 

The total number of unexcused 
absences allowed by the Standing Rules 
under Title VI, section 4.2, is three. 
Each missed roll call, which occurs at 
the beginning and the end of all meet-
ings, is considered half of an absence. 
The A.S. Council had already resolved 
to impeach Alrashed on the grounds of 
unsatisfactory attendance at the time of 
his resignation.

A.S. President Robby Boparai told 
the Guardian that the A.S. Council will 
move forward to replace Alrashed. 

“There are going to be open appli-
cations this week,” Boparai said. “And 
we will keep them open until probably 
the first week of the next quarter. After 
that, a committee will be put together 
to screen applicants and select the best 
one.”

Boparai went on to say that he 
hopes the work started by Alrashed will

Goltz Syndrome Critical For Cell Reprogramming
UCSD Researchers Studied Stem Cell Behavior and Wnt Proteins For Over Six Years 

BY Bryn na  bolt
Staff writer

Researchers from UCSD have 
found in a recent study using Goltz 
syndrome that Wnt proteins, regula-
tors of cell interaction during embryo-
genesis, are crucial to the process of 
cellular reprogramming. Their study, 
led by principal investigator and assis-
tant professor in the Department of 
Cellular and Molecular Medicine Dr. 
Karl Willert, was published in the Nov. 
20 online issue of Cell Reports. 

For the past six years, Willert’s 
lab has focused on the unique role of 
Wnt proteins in the regulation of stem 
cell behavior. These proteins are also 
present in areas of the body where 
there exist high stem cell populations 
throughout adult life. 

His most recently published study 
used a rare human syndrome called 
focal dermal hypoplasia, or Goltz syn-
drome, to determine what effect Wnt 
proteins have on the reprogramming 
of skin cells back into embryonic-like 
stem cells called induced pluripotent 
stem cells, or iPS cells. 

Goltz syndrome is a genetic dis-
order that primarily produces abnor-
malities of the skin, skeleton, eyes and 
face. It is an extremely rare disease, 
with only 200 to 300 cases documented 
worldwide, which makes it difficult to 
collect samples to perform experiments 
with. In order to collect the necessary 
biopsies to conduct his studies, Willert 
traveled to Orlando, Florida, where 
he attended a meeting with families 
who are affected by Goltz syndrome. 

Once there, he collected skin biopsies 
from 10 different patients with varying 
degrees of the condition to use for the 
study.

Researchers at UCSD then used the 
PORCN gene, a gene that is essential to 
activating Wnt proteins but is mutated 
in those affected by Goltz syndrome, 
from the samples to abolish any Wnt 
signaling within the skin cells. 

As a result, it became impossible 
to reprogram the skin cells back into 
iPS cells. Willert and his team deter-
mined from these findings that Wnt 
signaling was needed to establish the 
linking route necessary in reprogram-
ming cells. 

“We found it to be absolutely 
required,” Willert told the UCSD

the best candidate possible to both 
continue [Alrashed’s] work and start 
their own projects in service of the 
engineering community.”

Students enrolled at San Diego 
County colleges and universities 
have a new opportunity to show-
case vocal talent through Campus 
SuperStar, an American Idol-type 
singing competition with celebrity 
judges whose finalists will have the 
chance to win up to $5,000.

Benefiting Hillel of San Diego, 
the contest is open to all full-time 
undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents in the area who do not already 
have professional talent represen-
tation. The final competition will 
feature 10 finalists and take place 
at The Auditorium at The Scripps 
Research Institute on March 15.

Keri Copans, the Lori Bolotin 
Director of Development at Hillel of 
San Diego, told the UCSD Guardian 

that the Campus SuperStar judges 
will not be publicized before the 
audition period begins and said that 
they would probably be San Diego 
celebrities.

“The judges will be revealed 
in either January or February,” 
Copans said. “The judges will most 
likely be local performing arts 
professional[s], [for example, the] 
director of the Old Globe Theatre, 
as opposed to Hollywood celebri-
ties.”

Finalists will ultimately be 
crowned by the audience. The first, 
second and third place contestants 
will be awarded monetary prizes of 
$5,000, $1,500 and $1,000, respec-
tively.

Proceeds from the event will go 
toward increasing student involve-
ment in Hillel at local college cam-
puses. Copans said that the event 
aims to reach far beyond the Jewish 

student community.
“Each year, hundreds of thou-

sands of college students find com-
munity, create connections and 
build leadership skills on campus,” 
Copans said. “Hillel recognizes that 
college is a natural time for explo-
ration and identity formation, and 
Hillel relies on leadership, moti-
vated students and demonstrated 
university support to create positive 
memories for scores of students. 
While Hillel focuses on the needs 
for Jewish students, our programs 
are inclusive to all students and an 
event like Campus SuperStar shows 
our commitment to this.”

The event’s finalists will be nar-
rowed down through a system of 
auditions and callbacks. According 
to the website, auditions should 
be between 45 seconds and two 
minutes in length and all vocalists 
will be expected to sing live with a 

professional accompanist.
Students can visit the event’s 

website and sign up for one of three 
audition dates at three different 
San Diego universities: Jan. 11 at 
UCSD, Jan. 25 at San Diego State 
and Jan. 27 at Cal State San Marcos. 
Finalists will be expected to attend 
callback auditions on Feb. 1 and all 
subsequent rehearsals scheduled by 
the music director.

Copans added that although the 
concept of Campus SuperStar is not 
new, this will be the first year that 
Hillel of San Diego hosts the event.

“Campus SuperStar was created 
in 2004 by the Hillels of Georgia. 
Other Hillels that put on Campus 
SuperStar are Indiana University 
and the University of Pittsburgh,” 
Copans said.

Guardian. “It cannot be done without 
these signals.”

The goal of the studies conducted 
within his lab is to understand how 
Wnt proteins affect different biological 
processes, but recent findings could 
also be important to future medicine, 
according to Willert.

As Wnt signaling has been found 
to be important in cell regrowth, one 
idea is to block these signals with genes 

such as PORCN in order to treat cancer. 
However, this idea is precarious, Willert 
said, as Wnt is so essential to many 
other functions within the body, such as 
the maintenance of the intestinal tracts. 

Wnt proteins are also being consid-
ered as a future regenerative medicine, 
an idea inspired by certain animals’ 
ability to regenerate limbs through the 
reawakening of pathways present in 
stages of embryogenesis. Since Wnt sig-
naling is present and crucial during this 
period, it is believed that this signal-

ing could also be used to promote tis-
sue regeneration and growth in wound 
healing. 

“For right now, I’ll settle for regrowth 
of skin that’s been damaged because of 
a cut,” Willert said. “But in the future, 
these Wnt proteins have great potential 
for regenerative medicine.”

ensure that University of California 
remains accessible to future genera-
tions,” UCOP media specialist Brooke 
Converse told the UCSD Guardian. 
“This proposal, however, is a distrac-
tion from the central issue of the 
necessity for adequate state funding 
of higher education. It’s unclear what 
the goal is.”

She added that the entire UC sys-
tem already submits public account-
ability reports to the state legislature 
every year, and believes that changing 
the California Constitution would be 
counterproductive to maintaining its 
current education standards.

“Autonomy for the University of 
California has been guaranteed in the 
constitution since 1878. This was a 
deliberate decision by the state’s lead-
ers at the time,” Converse said. “The 
UC [system]’s autonomous gover-
nance has worked out very well for 
people and communities in every part 
of the state for well over 100 years.”

Mary Gilly, chair of the UC 
Academic Senate, also raised concerns 
over political interference in the UC 
curriculum and implications for other 
nonfinancial problems that the system 
faces.

“It seems to be someone looking 
for a tool or a weapon to use in reac-
tion to the proposed tuition increases,” 
Gilly said in a Dec. 5 San Jose Mercury 
News article. “It seems to be a nuclear 
weapon.”

Gov. Brown was a vocal opponent 
of the tuition increase, though he has 
thus far remained silent on the issue 
of SCA-1. The amendment would not 
require his signature to be implement-
ed if the legislature and California vot-
ers both approve the bill. 

UCSD A.S. Council President 
Robby Boparai finds the amendment 
intriguing, but is reluctant to form a 
definite stance on the matter while the 
legislation is still in such early stages.

“I don’t know what the outcome of 
this will be; there’s a lot of interesting 
politics and repercussions going on 
with the UC system,” Boparai said in 
a UCSD Guardian interview. “I think, 
in general, this bill has more pros than 
cons if passed, although there are a lot 
of concerns I think I might have … 
Keeping the status quo and changing 
it to Lara’s system both aren’t ideal 
scenarios, but maybe this new proposi-
tion might be a little better.”

He added that SCA-1 would ide-
ally provide students with more incen-
tives to go out and vote, should it 

pass through the state legislature, since 
voters have a greater pull on elected 
officials.

SCA-1 is one of several propos-
als released by the state government 
due to the recent UC tuition crisis. In 
a flurry of activity, Senate President 
pro tempore Kevin de Leon (D-Los 
Angeles) announced Senate Bill 15 
on Dec. 2 — his planned alterna-
tive to the Board of Regents’ five-year 
hike — while Assembly Speaker Toni 
Atkins (D-San Diego) suggested that 
Sacramento review the annual UC 
budget line by line starting next year. 

AVP Local Affairs Daniel Firoozi 
also told the Guardian that while 
state legislators may not all be on the 
same page, they have increasingly 
been reaching out to the UC Student 
Association with new initiatives to 
address tuition hikes and other issues. 

Both Firoozi and Boparai agreed 
that more concrete progress would 
need to be made on these propos-
als before A.S. Council or the UCSA 
could start student discussions and 
endorsing  particular viewpoints. 

Additional members of the UCSA 
could not be reached by press time.

“[SCA-1] Is A Weapon to Use in Reaction to Proposed Tuition Increases.”

Groucho Marx famously said, “I won’t join any club that would have me as a mem-
ber.” My sentiments match this for 
student media: Any newspaper that 
would hire me as its editor has got 
to be out of its mind.

But I was here. And I loved it.
We yelled. We screamed. We 

cried. We moved text boxes a pica 
at a time. We attended A.S. Council 
meetings. We endorsed candidates 
and then told you they were bad at 
their jobs. We fell in love. We threw 
parties. We recorded interviews. We 
transcribed press conferences. We sat 
courtside. We drove a beat-up golf 
cart and dropped off newspapers all 
around campus. We drank too much 
coffee. We drank too much “coffee.” 
We report, and you read.

As my tenure as editor-in-chief 
comes to an end, I feel like we did 
what we set out to do. We are the 
first responders to UCSD news, and 
we work to connect our readership 
with the news about what happens 
here.

This has been a marquee quarter 
for the UCSD Guardian coverage. 
We sent a reporter/photographer 
team to Oakland to hear Janet 
Napolitano’s tuition plan in per-
son. We had a reporter walk onto 
Interstate 5 to cover a protest. Our 
reporters have marched with the 
Che, walked the halls of Superior 
Court downtown, notched awards in 
design and content and have been a 
beacon of light for all that is student 
journalism. I could not be more 
proud of this staff and the work we 
have all accomplished. Thank you to 
all the Guardians who have stayed 
and supported our mission.

The next chapter of the

ing Editor-in-Chief Aleksandra

vation, determination and drive to 
make sure this paper keeps going 
strongly. I have no doubt that the

Students and Police Must Cooperate for Change

An individual’s rights, as an inhabitant of this country, dissipate once the very 
people entrusted with the respon-
sibility of protecting and serving 
those rights begin to attack them. 

This past weekend, students at 
UC Berkeley chose to demonstrate 
their rights as U.S. citizens. They 
assembled to protest the injustices 
committed against fellow citizens 
of color. However, the price of their 
actions was to experience firsthand 
the same discriminatory police 
brutality they were demonstrating 
against.

Videos and photographs taken 
at the protest show police officers 
aimlessly attacking peaceful protest-
ers by hitting them with batons hard 
enough to break a few rib cages 
and throwing tear gas bombs in an 
attempt to disperse them. Note that 
in most cases, these attacks came 
entirely unprovoked.

By, quite literally, trampling on 
this basic right, the police force 
becomes the enemy of the people. 
When police officers begin to pun-
ish the very people they swear to 
protect, we are forced to rumi-
nate on whether they can even be 

trusted in a time of severe hardship 
and crisis. 

French Enlightenment thinker 
Voltaire said, “With great power 
comes great responsibility.” Law 
enforcement officers are entrusted 
with the freedom and power to 
commit acts that the average citizen 
would go to jail for in order to 
protect the rights and well-being of 
those lacking that power. Inarguably, 
injuring nonviolent demonstrators 
illustrates a misguided definition of 
responsibility and an abuse of power.

Nonetheless, there were individu-
als that took advantage of the moral 
and civil obligations of protesters 
by looting and causing property 
damage. They are, in many ways, just 
as hypocritical as the police officers 
who hurt them, though they lack the 
training and equipment that police 
officers have. However, demonstra-
tors, once again, clearly conveyed 
their intention of peacefully commu-
nicating their grievances by walling 
off and protecting businesses from 
those hypocritical individuals.

Although protests do incon-
venience those not participating 
in them and occasionally get out 
of hand, their importance cannot 

be diminished. Change can only 
occur if people are aware of the 
fact that such an action is impera-
tive. Unfortunately, drastic actions 
like protests are the only way some 
people come to realize an injustice 
exists. 

Sadly, the actions of some police 
officers at the demonstrations put 
on by UC Berkeley students clearly 
validate the cause for protest. 
Instead of wasting resources on a 
preemptive strike on peaceful pro-
testers, police officers should have 
focused on keeping those engaged 
in the protest safe. 

Believe it or not, college stu-
dents will listen to police instruc-
tions and obey the law. So far at 
UCSD, students who have stood 
up for what they believe to be right 
have been fortunate not to have 
faced the type of harassment and 
harm that those at Berkeley have 
experienced. Although the protests 
on other campuses were a lot larger 
in size, protests at UCSD still prove 
that police officers and students 
can work together in harmony to 
fulfill their civil and moral obliga-
tions to upholding and utilizing 
basic rights.

Views expressed herein represent the majority vote of the 
editorial board and are not necessarily those of the UC 
Board of Regents, the ASUCSD or the members of the 

Guardian staff. 

After the events of the past two weeks, it suffices to say that UC students are not happy with the recent turn of the UC 
system’s financial plans. The cost of tuition is 
set to rise by almost 28 percent in the next five 
years, with the UC Board of Regents approving 
a 5-percent increase of tuition per year till 2019, 
unless the state approves more funding for the UC 
system. In light of the current situation and the gap 
in the budget, the California Senate has proposed 
its own plan to fix the crisis. However, neither of 
these supposed solutions is without fault. 

To begin with, let’s take a look at the plan 
proposed by the UC Regents. As mentioned above, 
this method of filling the budget shortfall would 
raise tuition by approximately 28 percent in the 
next five years, putting the cost of tuition at over 
$15,000 by 2019. This plan is simply wrong in 

principle. It strays even further from the Master 
Plan than we already have and would be akin to 
treating students of all socioeconomic tiers like 
cash cows. 

We do understand the reasoning behind this 
idea coming from the UC Regents: There is a lack 
of funding in the system, and the state should be 
paying for it, but as of yet, they are not. What it 
is not OK to do, however, is to instead ask the 
students to pay for the gap in the budget and then 
put that money toward things like raising the 
salaries of certain chancellors at UC campuses by 
up to 20 percent. It is also not OK to call this a 
solution to the current budget problem. A plan like 
this sets a dangerous precedent for future years 
when there is a gap in the budget, and the first 
thing the UC Regents think of is turning to the 
students to pay for it with higher tuition. 

With multiple unfeasible solutions for the budget gap floating around, it has become
 apparent that the leadership of  the University of  California needs to be shaken up.

potential uc tuition plans GRAPHICS REPORTING BY CHARU MEHRA// INFORGRAPHIC BY ALLISON KUBO

The figure above shows potential costs for UCSD students in the next 5 years, based on which budget plan gets implemnted. All numbers have been 
taken from the UC Office of the President’s website or calculated based on protected tuition levels.

The senate plan also has its 
woes. When we took a closer look 
at how this way of doing things 
would change tuition costs for 
different economic groups, we 
found that it would actually hurt 
the same people who need the 
most help. The main fault with 
the senate plan is that it gets rid of 
the recently established middle-
class scholarship, championed by 
previous Speaker of the Assembly 
John A. Perez. The group that gets 
hurt the most when tuition goes 
up is not the poorest students in 
the state — who don’t currently 
pay tuition under the Blue and 
Gold Opportunity Plan either 
way — but the lower-middle-class 
students whose families make 
between $80,000 to 100,000 and 
whose costs would go up by close 
to $2,000 if they lost the middle-
class scholarship money. The senate 

plan sounds wonderful in theory, 
especially when its proponents 
highlight the fact that tuition would 
not rise, but in practice, it would 
be highly detrimental to the large 
group of middle-class students 
attending UC schools. 

In a previous editorial, we 
argued for a “cap-and-screw” 
policy, wherein the number of 
out-of-state students admitted to 
the system would be capped, but 
the out-of-staters who did still 
attend UC schools would have their 
tuition raised. We still think this 
is the best plan, seeing as how it 
protects tax-paying Californians, 
keeps the middle-class scholarship 
and patches the hole in the budget. 
Speaker of the Assembly Toni 
Atkins agrees with us, to some 
extent. But we also understand that 
this is not a long-term solution. 
Tuition for any group cannot 
automatically be raised every time 
there is a gap in the UC budget.

As a result, we are heartily in 
favor of the proposed ballot measure 
SCA 1, which hands veto power 
over the UC Board of Regents to 
the state. Letting the system be run 
by elected officials who answer to 
their constituents every election year 
would be a far better solution to the 
financial woes we have faced over 
the past decade than letting the UC 
Regents line their own pockets and 
then charge students extra tuition 
to pay for it. If there was a budget 
shortfall or a question of a tuition 
hike, elected officials would need to 
fix it or vote on it while effectively 
representing the California citizens 
who put them into office. UC 
President Napolitano and the 
regents have proven time and time 
again that they don’t have the best 
interests of the students, faculty and 
staff of the UC system in mind. It is 
time to push them out of power and 
fix the broken leadership of the UC 
system.

BIG EYES
Directed by Tim Burton
Starring Amy Adams, Christoph Waltz, Krysten Ritter, Danny Huston
Release Date: Dec. 25

How would you feel if someone took credit for your hard work? Based on 
true events, “Big Eyes,” directed by Tim Burton, tells the story of Margaret Keane 
(Amy Adams), a single mother and struggling artist whose signature pieces are 
paintings of big-eyed children. With her prospects limited, she marries Walter 
(Christoph Waltz), a talentless painter but a savvy businessman. Walter begins 
selling Margaret’s work and taking credit for it, forcing Margaret to deny attach-
ment to her own work as she endures the horror of watching shameless market-
ers sell her paintings under her husband’s name.

Tim Burton is well-known for making quirky macabre films, but this year’s 
“Big Eyes” is a revival of sorts for Burton who, in the ‘90s, made films that revere 
the outsider, like “Ed Wood” and the classic “Edward Scissorhands.” Margaret 
Keane, a female hero in a male-dominated art world, had a story that Burton 
knew was worth telling.

Directed by J.C. Chandor
Starring Jack O’Connell, Miyavi, Domhnall Gleeson
Release Date: Dec. 25

A MOST VIOLENT YEAR

After his gorgeous man vs. nature epic, “All Is Lost,” director J.C. Chandor shifts 
gears once again with “A Most Violent Year.” Set in the savage winter of 1981, the film 
portrays the life of a Colombian immigrant trapped by the corruption of New York 
City. The film follows Abel and Anna Morales (Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain), a 
couple determined to remain honest amidst a place bleeding with filth and broken 
morals.  Chandor reinvents himself with the mettle of a fearless artist. After the frantic 
dialogues of “Margin Call” and the marathonlike silence of “All Is Lost,” Chandor zeros 
in on the American Dream, exposing it as if it was as delicate and as majestic as a tower 
of cards. Juilliard School classmates Chastain and Isaac promise to deliver powerful, 
Oscar-worthy performances — something that has become customary for the beautiful 
and talented Chastain. “A Most Violent Year” aims to be, at once, a stylish epoch piece 
and a character study — a moral tale within a gangster movie. With the versatility of 
the gifted Chandor, the expectations are as high as the city he depicts.

Directed by Angelina Jolie
Starring Jack O’Connell, Miyavi, Domhnall Gleeson
Release Date: Dec. 25

THE INTERVIEW

Action, vulgarity and absurdity — what else is expected of a Rogen-directed film? 
Seth Rogen and James Franco’s on- and off-screen friendship shines through in “The 
Interview.” Using their reputation and popularity from their tabloid TV show “Skylark 
Tonight,” David Skylark (Franco) and Aaron Rapoport (Rogen) get to interview North 
Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, who is a big fan of their show, in hopes of validating 
their skills as journalists. They find themselves in the midst of a top-secret mission 
from the CIA to assassinate Kim Jong-un. The helplessness of these two men leads 
to a highly anticipated, thrilling comedy. Audiences can expect a lot from this come-
dic duo, as their past comedy movies, like “Pineapple Express,” have demonstrated 
the hilarity that comes when these two actors are together. The plot in “Pineapple 
Express” showcases the close “bro-ship” between these two men, something that can 
be expected from the new action-comedy, “The Interview.”

IMITATION GAME
Directed by Morten Tyldum
Starring Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Mark Strong, Charles Dance
Release Date: Dec. 25

While Nazi Germany held Europe in its horrific grip, a small group of British 
mathematicians were racing against time to break the Germans’ secret communica-
tion code, Enigma. “The Imitation Game” tells the story of the man who led this 
effort, Alan Turing.

Benedict Cumberbatch, building on his past performance as a quirky yet bril-
liant Sherlock Holmes, plays the eccentric Turing, the so-called “father of computer 
science.” The film is not merely a tense tale against the backdrop of global terror. 
Cumberbatch delves into Turing’s heartbreaking backstory with brilliance, as Turing 
faces the consequences of being gay in 1940s England, where homosexuality was 
viewed as a crime.

With a strong supporting cast, including Keira Knightley and Mark Strong, and 
themes that span from World War II to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights 
to scientific discovery, “The Imitation Game” is a captivating experience, regardless 
of one’s personal taste in films.

Directed by Angelina Jolie
Starring Jack O’Connell, Miyavi, Domhnall Gleeson
Release Date: Dec. 25

UNBROKEN

Not even Hollywood could invent a tale as filled with inspiration as the unbeliev-
able, true story of “Unbroken.” Angelina Jolie’s second film tells the story of Olympian 
Louis Zamperini (Jack O’Connell) after joining the Air Force in 1941. Zamperini’s 
plane crashes in the Pacific Ocean, but while lost at sea, he is captured by the Japanese. 
In a prisoner of war camp, our hero is tormented by a sadistic army sergeant played by 
Miyavi, a Japanese singer and surprisingly intense actor.

Acting as the guiding force for talented actors, Jolie keeps the movie true to the 
story, having developed an intimate relationship with the real Zamperini, who died 
earlier this year. The runner-turned-World War II bombardier is played by the up-and-
coming O’Connell, who gives an expressive performance. With an emotional story and 
talented cast “Unbroken” hopes to win awards while remaining a faithful tribute to an 
astounding story of survival. 

Directed by Rob Marshall
Starring Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt, Johnny Depp, Anna Kendrick, Chris Pine 
Release Date: Dec. 25

INTO THE WOODS

Admit it: The exhausted trend of updating Brothers Grimm fairytales doesn’t 
exactly have you begging for another Cinderella story. So how do you react when 
Disney announces the premiere of “Into the Woods,” another classic tailored with 
theatrical alterations? Do you talk through the trailer because you’re sure you’ve seen 
every possible path Little Red Riding Hood could take to get to Grandma’s? 

No — forget everything you know about the Brothers Grimm. Director Rob 
Marshall refurbishes the clever fusion of the classic Grimm tales inherited from the 
original 1986 musical with dramatic cinematic elements, coloring the tale of the 
Bakers, who cross paths with familiar fairytale characters when they set out to break 
a curse cast by an evil witch (Meryl Streep) that has prevented them from having a 
child. Though the film faces the challenge of rivaling its Broadway counterpart, surely 
a star-studded cast and a charming soundtrack will make it a box office hit.

FILM   REVIEW

Exodus:  Gods  and  kings

When Ridley Scott announced he was going to direct “Exodus: 
Gods and Kings,” those of us who 
admire the legendary director of 
“Blade Runner” and “Alien” shook 
our heads in disbelief. Scott, the 
outspoken atheist, examining the 
relationship between a prophet and 
his God? Scott, the obsessive artist, 
portraying Moses, the insecure but 
inexorable lawgiver? Yes, this had to 
be better than winning the lottery — 
much better. Sadly, “Exodus” fails to 
deliver in almost every aspect. The 

plot feels fragmentary from start to 
finish — too many episodes are put 
together without a coherent argument. 
Even the nearly perfect visuals, 
which combine the elegant with the 
grandiose, are tainted by unnecessary 
and distracting 3-D. The film does a 
lot but accomplishes little.

“Exodus” follows Moses maturing 
from a prince of Egypt to a Jewish 
prophet. Scott and two-time Oscar-
winning writer Steven Zaillian 
(“Schindler’s List”) deviate from 
the biblical story to focus on the 
relationship between Ramesses II (Joel 

Edgerton) and his adopted brother, 
Moses (Christian Bale). The struggle 
begins early when a pagan prophecy 
— which the rational Moses 
dismisses with a laugh — predicts 
the emergence of a new leader in an 
upcoming battle. Ramesses naturally 
suspects that it refers to Moses and 
starts mistrusting his brother. The 
conflict explodes when he discovers 

Moses’ Israelite identity and pushes 
him into exile. Each sibling becomes 
the leader of his people; the film turns 
a political battle into a fraternal clash.

The biggest fight of all, however, 
occurs within the prophet’s head. 
Moses’ doubts about God’s mission 
and the initial rejection of his Jewish 
identity are the brightest spots of an 
otherwise disorganized storyline. 
Zaillian tries to do it all: Moses vs. 
Brother, Moses vs. Wife, Moses vs. 
God, Moses vs. Moses — you get the 
idea. The result is a highly complex 
character study, played with mastery 

by Bale but juxtaposed with a horde 
of underdeveloped characters who 
offer next to nothing. An obvious 
example is Joshua, played by Aaron 
Paul. “Breaking Bad” fans will be 
greatly disappointed seeing Paul 
underutilized in such a grotesque 
manner. Joshua stands awkwardly, 
almost speechless, for the entire 
movie. Similarly, Edgerton and Maria 
Valverde (Moses’ wife) are little more 
than walking cliches.

The strongest part of the film, 
Scott’s treatment of God and his 
motivations, is also its biggest 
flaw. “Exodus” has no qualms in 
representing God as a furious, cruel, 
tribal and sadistic force who kills 
innocent kids and torments entire 
civil populations with undeserved 
suffering. Is it about freedom, Moses 
asks, or is it really about vengeance? 
God is unapologetic in his answer 
— there is no freedom without 
vengeance, he seems to respond. 

This is “Exodus” at its best; however, 
as with the rest of the film, the flaws 
eclipse its virtues. Scott chooses to 
portray God as a scary 11-year-old 
boy. We get the symbolism: kids are 
instinctive and aggressive, but they are 
also truthful and free. The problem is 
that it’s not convincing. The otherwise 
fascinating exchanges between God 
and Moses become outright ridiculous 
by the presence of the kid-God. We 
simply do not buy it.

The film makes us sigh for what 
it could have been. Scott’s ambition 
ends up collapsing into nothingness. 
We leave the theater with an empty 
feeling, as if someone stole something 
great from us. In the end, the film is 
going to be remembered for its visual 
effects and Bale’s heroic acting. A sad 
ending indeed.

Anna Kendrick and Chris Pine talk about their roles in Disney’s up-
coming remake of the classic fairytale musical “Into the Woods.”

“Into the Woods” has been engulfed by buzzing anticipation as Disney and Stephen Sondheim fans alike wonder what sort of 
magic this unbelievable collaboration has in 
store for its Christmas Day debut. With a big-
name cast s tarring Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt, 
Chris Pine, Anna Kendrick and Johnny Depp, 
the musical-turned-film has sparked high expec-
tations for its modified retelling of the eerie 
Brothers Grimm fairytales. The UCSD Guardian 
caught up with Pine and Kendrick for their 
insight on Disney’s latest marriage of theater and 
film.

Guardian: What can this movie offer for differ-
ent audiences, both adults and children?

Anna Kendrick: I think that, thematically, a 
couple of pieces are about parents and children 
and the disappointments of parents and the 
failures of parents. It’s based on stories that par-
ents have told their children for generations, so 
there’s the element where it’s pure fantasy and it’s 
exciting for kids and then the elements which 
[are] specifically centered toward parents, which 
is [the message that] we have to be careful what 
we tell our children and [that] children take 
lessons to heart. And it’s sort of about under-

standing that they are listening to us even if it 
doesn’t feel that way, and it’s our responsibility to 
prepare them for the realities of the world, which 
is what the second half of the film is really about. 
And right now Chris Pine is harassing me. 
 
Chris Pine: I’m going to rip your wig off right 
now.
 
AK: Oh! Chris, something that you want to add?
 
CP: I think what Anna [said] deeply resonates 
with my own beliefs about the film.
 
G: How are each of you taking [your] roles and 
really making them your own?

CP: For my part, you know everyone in this 
film goes through these really complex jour-
neys, and they experience joy and heartache 
and sorrow and grief and then my prince is 
just way more two-dimensional than that. 
He’s kind of wonderfully self-absorbed, and 
I think that I had a lot of fun bringing some 
levity to the picture — or tried to — and 
there’s a bit of a buffoon in the prince. And 
he realizes [that when], I think finally, won-
derfully, Cinderella gives him the chance to 

really feel and to really connect with her. And 
I think he does for a brief second but then 
does make the choice to go back and run off 
and relive over and over and over again this 
storybook life that he is so accustomed to. 
But I had a lot of fun making the prince kind 
of buffoon-ish.

AK:  I had a lot of fun watching Chris be a 
buffoon. But I think that the great thing was 
that [director] Rob [Marshall] really embraced 
a modern sensibility for all the characters 
because, since these stories kind of belong to 
the ages, it makes sense that in some ways we 
update them every generation, and one [way] 
that he allowed me to do [that] was to sort of 
be a sort of overthinking, over-logical, neurotic 
princess. And I think modern women have a 
tendency to overthink everything, and they 
don’t trust their gut, and we have to think at 
everything from every angle to find the right 
decision and she’s doing that [through] the 
entire piece until something that she really 
has to reckon with happens. When the com-
munity is in crisis, suddenly, it’s very clear for 
her what’s important. And when the prince 
comes to her and tells her to come back to the 
castle, she’s very centered, and she’s very calm 

more so than she is in any other moment in 
the piece. And she says to the prince, “Do you 
understand me? Do we understand each other? 
Do we even live in the same emotional world?” 
And when the answer is no, it’s very easy 
for her to say, “I choose the unknown. Even 
though you represent security and a better life, 
I choose the unknown.”

G: What was the vibe like on set? What was 
the biggest advantage of working with such a 
talented group?

CP: I think Rob really set the tone in the 
beginning. You know, he’s a director who 
comes from the theater world, so he recog-
nized the importance and the real luxury 
of having a month for rehearsal before you 
ever show your [performance] to the public 
and he made sure to build that in. And even 
though … he didn’t get a chance to work 
with everyone, we did get a chance to see one 
another to see what everyone was doing, and 
I think that really helped infuse the project 
with a sense of community and that we were 
all kind of on the same page. And I think 
that you’ll hopefully feel that great feeling in 
the film.

When it comes to restau-rant recommendations, word of mouth is the 
best source of information on secretly 
delicious food joints. More and more 
people use websites like Yelp to spread 
the word and tell the world about 
their favorite “hole-in-the-wall” 
eateries. Yelp, by including Alforon 
in its Top 100 Places to Eat, helped 
Alforon, a Lebanese restaurant on El 
Cajon Boulevard the size of a living 
room, become famous countrywide. 
Out of all 100 places, five are located 
in San Diego, making this Middle 
Eastern restaurant a must-visit for 
UCSD students.

Admittedly, Alforon makes an 
ambivalent first impression. Located 
on a deserted part of El Cajon and 
surrounded by a bike shop and two 
smoke shops, it does not look like a 
top-25 restaurant in America on Yelp. 
As you enter the eatery, the impres-
sion does not change. There are only 
six tables in a relatively small one-
room space; the walls and ceiling are 
painted terra-cotta, making the place 
look dark, and as they are currently in 
the middle of renovations in an effort 
to expand, the left wall is currently left 
destroyed and covered with a black 
drape. However, if you convince your-
self that the odd exterior and interior 
only make Alforon more distinct and 
stay to try the food, you will be soon 
rewarded with exceptional service 
and dishes. In fact, one of the own-
ers, George or Samia, will make sure 

you are not left alone with your first 
impression and will seat you at a table 
immediately.

Undoubtedly, service is a very 
special part of the Alforon experi-
ence. George and Samia operate the 
whole restaurant — they both make 
your food and bring it to your table. 
Choosing food at Alforon is more 
of a conversation than an order-
making process. One of the owners, 
usually Samia, will sit at your table 
to ask about your preferences and 
cravings. Based on what you say, 
she chooses dishes for you. Such a 
service approach makes Alforon a 
perfect place for indecisive custom-
ers. You might be taken aback by 
Samia’s enthusiasm as she helps you 
out with an order, but it is simply a 
sign of how passionate the owners are 
about their business. This passion is 
also the reason why the owners made 
all their dishes truly affordable. The 
most expensive item, a dozen falafel 
pieces with tahini and pickles, costs 
$12.75 and should definitely be shared 
because one person alone can’t eat all 
12 pieces. In fact, you have to make a 
serious effort to go over $12 per per-
son for the entire meal.

Just as music is a harmony of 
sounds and a painting is a harmony 
of colors, any Alforon dish is a har-
mony of flavors. Both well-known 
Middle Eastern dishes, such as falafel, 
hummus and shawarma and Alforon-
special oven-baked flatbreads repre-
sent a perfect combination of flavors. 

With the soujouk — Armenian-style 
ground beef flatbread with tomato, 
onion and white cheese for $6.95 — or 
chicken tawook — chicken flatbread 
with garlic paste and pickles for $6.95 
— all flatbread toppings combine in 
one smooth and rich flavor, making 
you wonder whether there is a secret 
ingredient designed to tie meat, vege-
tables and spices together so perfectly. 
Just like pizza, Alforon flatbreads are 
meant to be shared; therefore, bring-
ing two or three people with you is 
a perfect way to try a wide variety of 
dishes. This is especially true in the 
mezza menu section, which has a 
selection of small appetizers that can 
be easily shared. Spreads like humous 
($5.45), labni (kefir cheese spread) or 
baba ghannouj ($5.95) are simply put 
on a thin pita bread that is included 
in the price, while signature Alforon 
grape leaves stuffed with rice, toma-
toes, parsley and spices are served by 
a dozen or half a dozen. Many of the 
mezza items do not contain any type 
of meat, so carnivores and vegetarians 
are equally welcomed at Alforon.

Presenting Middle Eastern cuisine 
at its finest and providing cozy, home-
like service, Alforon is a place where 
you feel like a guest at your friend’s 
house. So take your foodie friends 
and get ready to share the best dishes 
Lebanese cuisine has to offer.

Over this past weekend, UCSD’s 
Sports Clubs hosted the annual 
Dodgeball Extravaganza in the 
RIMAC Arena. 

Teams comprised of members 
from several different sports clubs 
on campus competed in a double 
elimination-style dodgeball tourna-
ment for prizes and fun. 

The event also focused on col-
lecting new toys for the Toys for 
Tots Foundation. The women’s club 
soccer team came together to bring 
the mostly new, unwrapped toys 
of all squads for children in need. 
Aside from the dodgeball and toys, 
teams also participated in a movie-
themed costume contest and social 
games of Spikeball. 

The women’s club ultimate team 
won first place in the costume 
contest by arriving dressed as the 
cast from Pitch Perfect. Women’s 

ultimate was also recognized for its 
outstanding turnout at the event. 

With two counts of dodgeball 
games happening at once, the tour-
nament quickly progressed from 16 
teams down to two. Men’s lacrosse 
and baseball went head-to-head in 
a best-out-of-seven championship 
game. 

The games were close, going 
back and forth between the two 
teams. Eventually, the tournament 
came down to the last match with 
both baseball and lacrosse at three 
wins each. Ultimately, the men’s 
lacrosse team came out victorious. 

All in all, the teams had a great 
time socializing and enjoying a 
friendly competition. This event 
would not have been possible 
without its sponsors: Sprinkles 
Cupcakes, Toys for Tots, Starbucks, 
Chipotle and Trader Joes; UC San 
Diego Sports Clubs thanks you for 
your donations and support.

SPORTS  CLUBS

WOMEN'S  BASKETBALL

Clubs Battle in Dodgeball

Tritons Split on the Road

Sports club play in annual dodgeball extravaganza. 

The UCSD women’s basketball 
team (3–4, 1–1) opened up confer-
ence play for the California Col-
legiate Athletic Association on the 
road this past weekend and went 
1–1 over the two-game stretch. The 
Tritons defeated Cal State Monterey 
Bay on Friday (68–57) before losing 
to Cal State East Bay on Saturday by 
a 74–57 score.

UCSD had a dominating defen-
sive showing on Friday, as it forced 
20 turnovers and scored 17 points 
off of them. The Tritons blew the 
game open right from the start with 
an early 20–5 run to pull ahead 
30–13. At the end of a strong open-
ing half, senior center Dana Webster 
put back an offensive rebound to 
beat the buzzer and give UCSD a 
34–19 lead entering intermission. 

Five minutes after halftime, 
UCSD jumped to its biggest lead at 
43–25, after a three from sophomore 
guard Beth Mounier. However, the 
Otters slowly skimmed the lead 
down until they only trailed by 
single digits at 62–54 after a Jenna 
Bandy shot from beyond the arc. Se-
nior guard Miranda Seto and junior 
forward Farrah Shokoor came up big 
in the closing minutes of the game 
to hold off the run by the Otters and 
ultimately earn a 68–57 win. 

“Now [our matchups] are in our 
league and obviously every game is 
important,” UCSD head coach Heidi 
VanDerveer said. “We went to Mon-
terey, and I thought our defense was 
very solid. We got in a nice offensive 
rhythm and that gave a nice flow to 
the game.”

 UCSD’s scoring was balanced, 
with Shokoor leading all with 17 
points and six rebounds and Seto 
adding 12 points, as the aggressive 
pair combined for 19 free-throw 
attempts. Webster also had a solid 
game coming from the bench as she 
recorded her first double-double of 
the season with 12 points and 11 
rebounds.

The following night, UCSD again 
started the game off strong but could 
not maintain its momentum against 
Cal State East Bay. The Tritons got 
a 30–13 early lead, with six minutes 
and 29 seconds left in the first pe-

riod after Seto sank a three-pointer 
and senior guard Stephanie Yano 
chipped in a pair of free throws. 
However, East Bay showed resilience 
and slowly crept closer, until the 
Pioneers made it a six-point game at 
halftime at 36–30 on a junior guard 
Shannon Bland layup to beat the 
buzzer. 

“We played against a very good 
East Bay team, and we played very 
well in the first half,” Vanderveer 
told the UCSD Guardian. “In the 
second half, we struggled to find an 
offensive or defensive rhythm. We 
got some decent shots but missed 
them — shots that we normally 
would make.”

With 14 minutes and 13 seconds 
left in the second period, back-to-
back threes by Cal State East Bay’s 
junior guard Mo Fegan first tied the 
game up at 41 apiece, then provided 
the lead for the Pioneers. After 
sophomore forward Cassie MacLeod 
tied it up again on a three for the 
Tritons, Cal State East Bay pulled 
away and outscored the Tritons 
30–13 in the remaining minutes en 
route to a 74–57 victory. 

Senior forward McKennan 
Bertsch came close to a double-
double as she scored 18 points and 
added nine rebounds. Shokoor had 
seven points and game-high 18 
boards. Seto, Yano and sophomore 
guard Haley Anderson, the three 
starting guards, struggled with their 
shooting, going for a combined 7–26 
from the field. Cal State East Bay 
had four players in double-figures 
scoring.

“We had some foul trouble with 
Miranda [Seto],” VanDerveer said. 
“We have to play through foul 
trouble, and we are deep enough 
to be able to do that. Our defense 
needs to help our offense find a good 
rhythm and we just couldn’t do that 
this time.”

 UCSD will remain on the road 
for one more game this week before 
taking a short break from ac-
tion. The Tritons will have a tough 
matchup in league opponent No. 25 
California State Polytechnic Uni-
versity Pomona this Friday, Dec. 12. 
The game will tip off at 6 p.m. 

UCSD defeats CSUMB, blows lead in loss to CSUEB

The men’s water polo squad undoubtedly had the most success of all Triton teams 
in this fall athletic season. While UCSD was slated early on to host the 2014 national 
championship at home at Canyonview Pool, securing a competing spot themselves 
was far from a guarantee. As a Division II team consistently facing the top Division-I 
teams, the Tritons had an exceptional challenge ahead of them. However, this year’s 
group seized control of their fate with the help of a strong core of veterans including 
senior utility Josh Stiling, who earned his second Western Water Polo Association 
MVP award, and senior goalkeeper Cameron Ravanbach, who tied UCSD’s single 
season saves record, among others. The Tritons eventually fought their way into the 
Final Four, during which they fell to the top two teams in the nation in No. 1 UCLA 
and No. 2 Stanford. Despite the losses, fighting for the national crown in front of a 
home crowd appeared satisfactory enough to a spectacular season. While an invalu-
able set of eight seniors will depart, expect longtime head coach Denny Harper to 
maintain the respected status of the men’s water polo program in 2015. 

Women’s volleyball finished 2014 just above 0.500 with a final win 
against Cal State Monterey Bay on Nov. 15. The Tritons entered the 
year with high expectations, but ultimately wore down at the crucial 
stretch of the season. Though the team fell in rankings throughout 
the 2014 campaign, the team did at least produce two players with 
California Collegiate Athletic Association postseason honors  in 
senior opposite Caitlin Brenton and junior outside hitter Danielle 
Dahle. Brenton also earned an American Volleyball Coaches Associa-
tion All-West Region honorable mention and recognition as a Capital 
One Academic All-American. In 2015, UCSD can expect better out-
comes within both CCAA competition and its overall record. With 
Brenton being the exception, all other players are due to return for 
the 2015 season along with a promising recruiting class that will give 
UCSD a competitive edge as a veteran squad in league play. 

After an impressive showing of 
teamwork at NCAAs Regionals, the 
entire women’s cross country team 
qualified for nationals. The team 
performed well, placing 21 out of 
32 teams at the NCAA Division-II 
National Championship in Louisville, 
Kentucky on Dec. 6. 

On the men’s side, senior Tanner 
Collins, qualified for the individual 
race and placed 78 out of 245 runners. 
Though the Tritons will bid farewell to 
standout Michelle Le Roux along with 
Collins and Madison Tanner, both the 
men’s and women’s teams will welcome 
back a strong group in 2015 with 
full potential to make a return to the 
natinoal stage. 

FALL SEASON IN REVIEW
BY BRANDON YU, JOHN STORY, & DANIEL SUNG SPORTS EDITOR & ASSOCIATE EDITORS

DESIGN BY SHERMAN ALINE

THE 2014 FALL TRITON SEASON WAS A WILD ONE, WITH FOUR TEAMS OUT OF FIVE CLINCHING AN NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP BERTH. IN CASE 
YOU WERE TOO CAUGHT UP IN THE SWING OF THE QUARTER, TAKE A LOOK AT THE GUARDIAN’S REVIEW OF AUTUMN’S ATHLETICS. 

MEN'S  SOCCER

WOMEN'S  VOLLEYBALL

Overall Record: 9-6-3
Eliminated  in  1st  Round  of  NCAA  Championship

Despite the loss of an incredibly talented senior 
class after the 2013 season, the men’s soccer squad 
constructed a surprisingly formidable set of new lead-
ers in the 2014 campaign. Senior midfielder Brandon 
Bauman broke out in his final year, scoring six goals and 
tallying nine assists through 20 games. UCSD’s stout 
defensive front, along with the strong play of junior 
goalkeeper Cameron McElfresh, also recorded a stellar 
nine shutouts on the season. With a reliable collection of 
veterans and rising young talent, the Tritons produced a 
wild ride of a season. They performed well in the regular 
season but fell early on in conference playoffs. However, 
following what seemed to be the end, the team was given 
new life after a surprising qualification to the NCAAs. 
The Tritons would officially end their season in the first 
round of the tournament to nationally ranked No. 14 
Cal State Los Angeles via a prolonged and ultimately 
heartbreaking series of penalty kicks, but their efforts in 
reaching such a point were undoubtedly impressive.

The women’s soccer team’s overall record and its final placement did not do justice to the memorable 
season that was. After starting the season with a 1-3-1 conference record, the Triton women would go on an 
undefeated streak in the final six games of the season to miraculously force their way into the postseason. 
During that entire final stretch, in which UCSD won five matches and tied in another, the Tritons amazingly 
allowed only one goal. Leading the Tritons was senior midfielder and team captain Cassie Callahan, who 
wraps up her decorated collegiate career with another impressive year, scoring four goals with three assists — 
three of the goals being game-winners. The year also gave way to a new star for the blue and gold in freshman 
midfielder Jordyn McNutt, who scored five goals and recorded a team high seven assists. Unfortunately, the 
squad’s momentum would not carry into the playoffs, as they would be upended by Cal Poly Pomona in the 
first round of the conference championship. Despite the abrupt ending, the success of the squad’s season does 
not lie in its early finish, but how admirably the team responded when their backs were against the wall.
