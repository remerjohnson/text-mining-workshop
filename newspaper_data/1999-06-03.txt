LOS ANGELES. Calif. -
New guidelines proposed hy 
the U.S. Department of 
Education could outlaw the 
SAT as a factor in college 
admissions, forcing universi-
ties nationwide to establish 
new admissions criteria. The 
draft document would ban 
"the usc of any education 
tests which Ihavel a signili-
cant disparate impact on 
members of any particular 
race, national origin, or sex 
... unless it is educationally 
nece sary and there is no 
practicable alternate form of 
as ·essmenl." Evaluations of 
the SAT indicate that under-
represented minorities and 
female students score consis-
tently lower than their white, 
male counterparts.

CAFE: University Centers may 
propose a fee increase in the fall 
to pay for $250,000 in repairs 
By Jeffrey M. Barke, 
Senior Staff Writer 

On weekend nights, it serves a venue for rock 
bands that play to all-ages crowds. On 
Wednesdays, the structure houses cafeteria-style, 
vegetarian "all-you-can-eats." 

But in six years, the Che Cafe may not even 
be standing, according to a routine maintenance 
report conducted by the University Centers 
Advisory Board (UCAB). 

Brian Cross, student chair of UCAB, said that 
health and safety inspections of the facility have 
revealed plumbing problems, fire hazards and a 
general decaying of "the intemal nuts and bolts 
of the Che." 

The Che Cafe will be uninhabitable in six 
years, perhaps sooner, Cross said. 

UCAB determined that $250,000 in repairs 
will be needed to bring the building up to code, 
without any additions, cosmetics or frills. 

"We don't have enough money in reserves," 
Cross said about the estimate. 

However, UCAB has plans to resurrect the 
student centers fee referendum that failed to pass 

when too few votes were cast during this quar-
ter's elections. The referendum is being rewritten 
to include the repairs needed by the Che. 

Cross said that UCAB hopes to put the $12 
million upgrade of the Price and Student Centers 
to a second vote late next fall quarter. 

In order to garner enough votes to pass the 
referendum this time around, Cross said that 
UCAB is looking to allow voting on the Intemet 
through StudentLink. 

Cross also said that he has spoken with sever-
al other universities who have turned to electron-
ic voting. 

"Penn and some other schools have seen an 
increase from 17 to 18 percent voter turnout to 40 
to 50 percent," Cross said. 

The original referendum carried with it $25 
per quarter tudent fee. The referendum stated 
that students would be charged the quarterly fee 
only when the additions to the student centers 
were completed and usable. Cross said that 
UCAB is working hard to include the repairs to 
the Che in the fee without raising it. 

Of the ballots cast earlier this quarter, 55 per-
cent were in favor of the fee. 

Those who spend their days inside the mural-
covered walls of the Che are skeptical about the 
maintenance report's findings.

Parking 
Survey 
Released 
RESULTS: Most students 
will pay for convenience 
altemati ve transportation 

.. 

By Vincent Gragnani 
Senior Staff Writer 

In an effort to find solutions to over-
crowded parking at UCSD, the A.S. 
Executive Committee on Parki ng and 
Transportation Issues recently completed 
an extensive survey of students, faculty 
and staff. The survey found, among other 
things, that students want more money 
spent on linding altemative forms of 
transportation and that they would prefer 
market-based parking systems that 
would give people the option of paying 
more for more convenient parking 
spaces. 

Former Revelle Junior Senator Casey 
Luskin, chair of the committee, said that 
while there is work yet to be done. he 
feels that this year's committee gathered 
significant findings. 

"I think we were successful in com-
pleting a very complete and wholistic 
survey of the undergraduate population 
as to their take on par.king," Luskin said. 
"We basically did the first comprehen-
ive undergraduate survey ever done at 
U~SD. We definitely learned things 
about how UCSD students feel about 
parking." 

The committee surveyed 572 people. 
535 of which were students. Of those 
surveyed, 78 percent were either dissatis-
fied or extremely dissatisfie~ with the 
parking situation at UCSD. 

The results from two questions on the 
survey showed that students are willing 
to pay more money for increased conve-
nience. Fifty-five percent of those sur-
veyed said they would rather have 
increased fees with increased parking 
structures than maintained fees with 
parking lots located far from campus. 
Only 33 percent preferred to have main-

Muir Quarterly Sues Salsa Rio for Fail~re to 
LAWSUIT: Publication is suing local restaurant in a San Diego small claims court for $170 
By Vincent Oracnenl 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Mllir Quarterly filed a law-
suit May II against Salsa Rio after 
the restaurant 's owner allegedly 
failed to pay for an October 1997 
advertisement in the paper. 

Former Editor in Chief Kevin 
Stephens said the lawsuit, filed in 
the small claims division of the San 

Diego County Superior Court, asks 
for $170; $150 is for the advertise-
ment and $20 is to cover the cost of 
filing in small claims court. 

Stephens said that while the 
original court date was set for June 
3, Salsa Rio owner Mauhew Tikam 
asked that the date be pushed back 
to Jul~ 6. 

Muir's Assistant Resident Dean 

Kathie Poff, who serves as an advi-
or to the Mllir Quarterly, said that 

if students are not available to rep-
resentlhe case in July she would do 
it herself. She added, however, that 
because the Mllir Quarterly is a 
student group, she would prefer to 
see students handle the case. 

Stephens said that after the 
advertisement ran in the Muir 

Quarterly, he and other editors of 
the paper sent and hand-delivered 
invoice and copies of the adver-
tisement to Tikam. Stephens aid 
that when Tikam did not pay for the 
advertisement. he considered 
options such as going thtough a 
collection agency or having the UC 
Regents file a lawsuit against the

5k Walk to Honor Former Thernpist 
The Rita Po~ers ' Powers Walk (RPPW), a 5k, com-

munity-sponsored walk, will be held on June 26 in 
Balboa Park at 6th and Spruce Street. The walk is 
being held in honor of Rita Powers, a therapist who 
was shot and killed last year at the age of 41. 
Proceeds from the walk will benefit Powers' two sons. 

The RPPW committee is in the process of applying 
for non-profit status for future walks. Its goal is to 
make the walk an annual event that will assist other 
children who have tragically lost a parent. 

Registration is at 8 a.m., and the walk will take 
place from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. The fee for the walk is 
$20, which includes a complimentary Powers Walk T-
shirt. Walkers are encouraged to solicit their own 
pledges and sponsors. 

Mailloux Named Interim 
Humanities Director 

Steven Mailloux, professor of English and compar-
ative literature at the University of California. Irvine, 
has been appointed interim director of the UC 
Humanities Research Institute. A new director for the 
UC Humanities Research Institute will be selected fol-
lowing a national search . . 

Mailloux will replace Patricia O'Brien, who was 
appointed dean of the College of Humanities, Arts and 
Social Sciences at UC Riverside, effective July 1, 1999. 

The UC Irvine-based Humanities Research Institute, 
a unit of the UC Office of the President, serves all nine 
UC campuses. It brings together teams of scholars and 
practitioners from different academic fields and differ-
ent institutions from throughout the UC system and the 
world to work on a wide range of topics. 

Recent institute research has focused on art his-
tory, censorship, citizenship, criminal justlc~, the envi-
ronment, ethics and genetic technology and curricu-
lum reform. 

The institute was recently awarded a challenge 
grant from the National Endowment for the 
Humanities (NEH). Funds raised through the NEH chal-
lenge, which will match one federal dollar to every 
three dollars contributed by donors, will be used to

Immigration Center Formed 
STUDIES: New research and training center will integrate courses into 
graduate and undergraduate programs in the next academic year 
By Jennifer Grady 
Staff Writer 

UCSD recently authorized the 
creation of an interdisciplinary, 
campus-wide research and training 
center that will focus on worldwide 
immigration patterns. 

The first of its kind at a major 
west coast university, the Center 
for Comparative Immigration 
Studies (CCIS) will systematically 
compare the current and historical 
immigration experiences of the 
United States and other labor-
importing countries. CCIS pro-
grams and cour es will gradually 
be integrated into UCSD graduate 
and undergraduate programs in the 
next academic year. 

CCIS will be directed by Wayne 
Cornelius, an immigration expert, 
political scientist and former direc-
tor of UCSD's Center for U.S.-
Mexican Studies. 

Cornelius stated that the cre-
ation.ror this center stemmed from 
the strong demand for field 
research training in the area of 
immigration. 

"The center was my idea. I saw 
a need for it and I believed that 
UCSD had a comparative advan-
tage over other universities for 
developing an immigration studies 
center," Cornelius stated. "I pro-
posed the concept to the UCSD 
administration and to the Illore than 
two dozen UCSD faculty who do 
research and teach about immigra-
tion and got a very positive 
response." 

He also stated that Peter 
Timmer. dean of the Graduate 
School of Intemational Relations 
and Pacific Studies (IRlPS), was 
instrumental in the formation of 
this center. 

"Peter Timmer ... was especially 
enthusiastic and offered IRIPS as 
the Center 's home base." Cornelius 
stated. 

CCIS will provide opportunities 
for field work and student training. 
In addition to studying Europe and 
North America, it will focus on 

"Undergraduates 
will have an 
opportunity to take 
a specially designed 
cou .... In tleld 
re .. arch methods 
for Immigration 
studle. and to 
participate In team 
fieldwork projects 
under faculty 
supervision. " 

Wayne Corneilul 
CCIS Director 

A ian countries that both send and 
receive immigrants. 

A statement from the university 
said that the center will maintain a 
cross-regional rather than a U.S.-
centered perspective. thus distin-
guishing itself from other immigra-
tion studies programs in the United 
States. Immigration courses will be 
taken in conjunction with other 
classes to satisfy requirements for 
undergraduate majors. Classes may 
also be applied toward an interna-
tional studies major after its cre-
ation. 

"Undergraduate training will be 
a high priority for CCIS," 
Comelius stated. "This will not just 
be a research center for faculty and 
graduate students. Undergraduates 
will have an opportunity to take a 
specially designed course in field 
research method for immigration 
studies and to participate in team 
fieldwork projects under faculty 
supervision. " 

Cornelius added that students 
would have a wide range of 
research sites available to them. 

"The research sites could be 
anywhere in Sim Diego or Imperial 
counties [or other] parts of south-
em California, Mexico and Texas," 
Cornelius stated. "CCIS will also 
assist students in designing a

course concentration or 'track ' in 
immigration studie , within their 
majors." 

A 1999 pamphlet from the 
Center for Comparative 
Immigration Studies tated thai one 
objecti ve of the center is to develop 
collaborative relati onships with 
immigration speciali sts al other 
univer ities. 

COllaboration with the 
California State and University of 
California campuses - along with 
universities in TIjuana and the East 
Coast - will lead to jointly spon-
sored and funded conferences, 
research projects and research 
workshops. Princeton Univer ity 
and UCSD have already estab-
lished such a relationship. 

Situated on the West Coast next 
to the Mexican border, UCSD is in 
an ideal location for students and 
faculty to conduct immigration 
research, according to Cornelius. 
Because of UCSD's close proximi-
ty to Mexico. students will be able 
to take advantage of this "natural 
laboratory" in order to gather data 
on immigrant populations in the 
United States and potential emi -
grants in sending countries. 
Students will be able to gain practi -
cal field experience in the neigh-
boring San Diego, Imperial, 
Orange and Los Angeles counties. 

CCIS is working in conjunction 
with UCSD faculty to create an 
international studies major. 
Currently, 45 courses containing 
immigration studies content are 
offered or are in developmen\ at 
UCSD. These courses are offered 
over 10 disciplines, including polit-
ical science, economics, sociology 
and cthnic studies. 

CCIS will be housed in the 
Graduate School of IRIPS at 
UCSD. Additionally, cels will 
work with the Center for U.S.-
Mexican Studies at UCSD, which 
has brought more than 200 immi-
gration specialists from major 
research universities around the 
world since 1980.

In my own experience, the 

search for and co-existence with 
roommate ha be6n difficult, at 
best. It might be a cliche, but 
there 's still an element of truth to 
the old saying: There's a world of 
difference between liking some-
one enough to be friend with 
them and liking them enough to 
stand living with them. 

Often the qualities that make 
you like the person so much a a 
friend are the very things that 
make you completely crazy while 
sharing an apartment. A talkative 
friend slowly lran forms into an 
ine capable chatterbox. The care-
free, devil-may-care attitude of 
another means that she never 
cleans the balhrooms or does lhe 
dishes. And the worst part of this 
is lhe guilt of being pissed at 
roommales because they're also 
friends. 

BUI when I talk to friends liv-

Take note of this, freshmen 
in particular, and stay away 
from newspaper listings at all 

costs! Even at best, there's some-
thing rather di comforting about 
living with someone you don ' t 
know (and in most situation I've 
seen, both people don ' t make 
much of an effort 10 get to know 
each other). It seems like instead 
of greeting each Olher with, "Hey, 
what's up, how are you?" A more 
appropriate address would be 
along of the lines of "Oh, hello, 
person I happen to live with." 

But, as I ee it, maybe all of 
this hassle is a blessing in di -
guise. If nothing else, rooming 
with others, and especially annoy-
ing others, definitely fine-tunes 
your patience. And it 's certainly a 
motivational device to succeed in 
~he future, so that in my post-col-
lege life I'll never be forced to 
room wilh anolher person again 
(well, marriage would be an 
exceplion, I suppose).

Special to the Guardian 

A few weeks ago, the lifeless 
body of a 20-year old university 
junior was found sprawled on the 
couch in his Ventura County dorm 
room. The bright, sports medicine ' 
major at Cal Lutheran University 
in Thousand Oaks died of an acci-
dental overdose of akohol , 
authorities concluded. 

It cou ld easily happen any-
where young adults chug too 
much booze at one time. This 
so\>ering reminder is omething to 
keep in mind as we break for sum-
mer vacation with all the trappings 
of freedom from class and entice-
ments of alcohol -laden beach, 
Illock and boating parties in San 
Diego. 

Any physician will tell you that 
people under 21 are especially 
vulnerable to death by alcohol 
poisoning because they are not 
fully developed physically and 
emotionall y. In addition, young 
people don't know how to drink in 
moderation because they are not 
yet equipped with the experience, 
knowledge or understanding of 
personal risk to know when to say 
when. 

Binge drinking (more than five 
drinks at one silting) is the most 
serious problem facing college 
campuses today, according to col-
lege administrators. At least 43 
percent of college students say 
they are binge drinkers and 21 
percent say they binge drink fre-

Problems persist even if 

school s prohibit alcohol. Cal 
Lutheran does not allow alcohol 
on campus, yet the victim in the 
above example died from alcohol 
poisoning. 

Even if the re ults from binge 
drinking are not immediately 
fatal, those who begin drinking 
before age 21 are more likely to 
become alcoholics than those who 
start drinking later in life. 
Furthermore, alcohol creates a 
range of health and social prob-
lems and figures prominently in a 
violent mix of date rape. sexually 
transmilted diseases, suicide, 
homicide and academic or profe -
sional failure. 

According to an article in the 
Journal of the American Medical 
Association, on college campuses 
where more than 70 percent of the 
student body binge drinks, 87 per-
cent of the students report experi-
encing problems such as physical 
a sault, sexual harassment and 
impai retl sleep and study time. 

We don' t need alcohol to have 
a good time this summer. We can 
enjoy healthy, non-alcoholic and 
overall safe celebrations as an 
alternative to dangerous, damag-
ing, drinking parties. UCSD' stu-
dents are our country's future 
leaders. We can start now and lead 
by example. 

There is no shortage of incen-
tives for minors in our society to 
drink . We live in a soeial environ-
ment that encourages and glamor-

izes.youth and alcohol. Most pop-
ular movies depict alcohol and 
other substance use in a favorabl e 
light. Let us focus on measures to 
change that hazardous envi ron-
ment away from one that barrages 
young people with promises of 
excitement-filled fun in a can or 
boltle. Let us support policies that 
aim to eliminate television and 
outdoor billboard advertising that 
paint an enticing and harmless 
picture of alcohol. 

College students have great 
hopes and dreams - don' t drown ' 
them in one binge-drinking 
episode or the crime and violence 
that often results. 

The Cal Lutheran student was 
an aspiring athletic trainer, now 
he 's just a statistic. Just as this stu-
dent lost his life, other promising 
lives can quickly be snuffed oul. 
This is a call to arms to embrace 
each other with heartfelt concern 
for a safe and sound summer, so 
that we' ll see you in September.

Bookstore Program to Help Students 'Save a Million' 
CAMPAIGN: Increased competition from Internet textbook sales prompts marketing campaign to reduce student costs 
By J .. tlne Sklar 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD Bookstore is launch-
ing the "SAVE-A-MrLLlON" text-
book campaign this spring to 
encourage students to sell had 
their used texthooks. In an effort to 
sell more used textbooks than ever 
before. the bookstore is offering 50 
percent of the new price for books 
on next year 's course reading I!sts. 

Bookstore Director John Turk 
said that this campaign is in response 
to textbook competitors including 
the UCSD GenemI Store Co-op and 
outside sources such as Internet 
booksellers. 

'There are a lot of new compa-
nies all on the Internet .... We are 
trying to improve the image of the 
bookstore to be more competitive," 
Turk said. "[f we' re going to pro-
vide students with comparahle 
prices, we need to have a lot more 
used hooks. There are not a lot of 
used books on the Internet." 

The new program has three 
objectives; the lirst is to increase 
the number of di scounted text-

books. The second is to increase 
the half-price book list by gelling 
more information from the faculty 
on required course textbooks. The 
third goal of the program is to have 
more used books for sale at the 
beginning of the fall term by buy-
ing back more used books from 
students. 

Turk said that competition is so 
tierce, he estimates that for every 
used book there are six buyers. 
Turk says he would like to get 80-
90 percent of the textbook stock at 
UCSD to consist of used materials. 

He added that there is a need to 
tower the price for new textbooks. 

"We also need to find creative 
ways to lower prices on new 
books," Turk said. "If we don 't do 
this, we become less and less com-
petitive in the future." 

Course Materials Department 
Manager David Wilson said that 
increased choices in the textbook 
market h~lp the bookstore to beller 
serve students. 

"Competition, if you look at it 
the right way, can make you beller 

"We also need to 
tlnd creative wa,.

new books. If we

-John Turk 
Bookstore Director 

at what you do: serve students." 
Wilson added that the UCSD 

bookstore doesn' t have neighbor-
hood competitors and doesn' t have 
to worry about the "bookstores 
down the street." 

'The ri e of the Internet .book 
sales as our competitor is creating 
opportunities to serve our cus-
tomers belter," he said. 

Turk said he hopes the book-
store will have more used books to 
sell in the bookstore and in the 
tong- run will save students money. 

The bookstore is trying to save stu-
dents nearly $ 1 million for the 
1999-2000 school year. 

Turk said he liked the "SAVE-A-
MILLION" title of the new program. 

'The program needed a focus 
and a slogan [soJ our staff would 
constantly be thinking to save stu-
dents money," he said. 

Wilson said that the bookstore 
would like to make elling books 
back a more positi ve experience for 
students by pay ing them more 
money for their used books. Each 
academic department has a respon-
sibility for getting the list from 
their faculty and transmitting it to 
the bookstore. The bookstore has 
tried to work with the faculty to get 
their book lists earlier. Once the 
bookstore knows a book will be 
used again, they can offer the 50 
percent buy-back rate to students. 

Wilson said the last UCSD 
Bookstore marketing campaign, 
"CASH for books," helped pro-
mote the bookstore's program of 
buying back books. Turk said that 
the new program is actually an 

extension of what the bookstore is 
doing already. 

Wilson said he feels the "SAVE-
A-MILLION" campaign gives the 
UCSD Bookstore an opportunity to 
show not just students but the 
entire community they are trying to 
help students save money. 

Wilson said that the UCSD 
Bookstore held a con lest among 
departments to see who could get 
the most required tex tbooks for next 
fall in by May I. He said that by 
doing so, when buy-back starts, the 
UCSt) bookstore can give half-price 
back for all of the books on the list. 

Wilson said the more students 
that sell their books back, the more 
used books they will have for the 
upcoming term. 

"We have to do a better job [01] 
creating a list that will pay more 
money back to students, but we 
can 't do it all in one term," he said. 
"We have to change the attitude of 
the faculty and change the minds of 
students that it's a better deal for 
them ... and hopefully they will se ll 
back more books."

Area Code to Change to 858 CHi: Members 
say structure does 
not need repairs 
ContInued from'"". 1 

The Che, one of the only all-
ages music venues in San Diego, 
hosts local and nationally touring 
bands an average of twO nights per 
week. SHin: UCSD will become part of the new zone next week 

By ChrIstine Pangan 
Staff Writer 

The area code of the UCSD 
main campus and nearby La Jolla 
and San Diego communities will 
change from 619 to 858 0 11 
SalUrday. June 12, 1999. 

The area code change will not 
affect the price of phone calls. 
Five-digit di aling at UCSD will 
also remain in effect. _ 

Beginning June 12. there will 
be a six-month permissive dialing 
period in which those outside the 
calling area may dial either the old 
619 area code or the new 8S area 
code. Mandatory dialing or the 
8S area code will begin Dec. II , 
1999. 

Assistant Vice Chancellor ~I' 
Administrative Computing and 
Telecommunications Elazar C. 
Harel suggests preparing I'or the 
change. Some steps to take 

include changing stationary and 
business cards, notifying fri ends, 
relatives and clients of the new 
area code and reprogramming the 
out-dial lists on personal comput-
ers. 

Las t June. the California 
Public Utilities Commission 
(CP C) approved the three-way 
geographic split of the 619 tele-
phone area code. 

The central section of San 
Diego, which includes downtown 
San Diego and the UCSD Medical 
Center, will retain the 619 area 
code. 

The area code of the northern 
section, including La Jolla, Del 
Mar. Mira Mesa, Poway, Solana 
Beach and Mission Beach will be 
al'fected by the change to 858 next 
week . 

The eastern section, including 
Coronado. Chula Vista, EI Cajon. 

Lakeside and the majority of the 
southern section of San Diego will 
receive a new 935 area code next 
year. on June 10,2000. 

Last year, the CPUC held sev-
eral public heari ngs in the San 
Diego area regarding changing the 
619 area code. Suggestions from 
residents included keeping the 
619 area code for thei r area or an 
"overlay" in which new numb~rs 
would have a new area code, 
while old numbers would retain 
the 619 area code. 

The CPUC opted for a three-
way geographic split io accommo-
date the great demand for new 
phone numbers that has arisen, 
partly from increased cellular -
phones and Internet usage. M::ps

changes and more information on

"I don 't believe it." aid Tara 
Barnes. one of five core members 
of the Che collective. She said 
there are no major problems with 
the building. 

Mike Towber, also a core mem-
ber, agreed. 

"The toilet leaks a bit and 
DarkStar is moving in, that's about 
it," he said. 

Memll-,rs of the non-profi t Che 
collective are also concerned about 
having to close for any amount of 
time. 

"It sucks for bands," Barnes 
said.

There is a blueprint of the Che 
that dates the building to 1921 , 
Towber said. 

Architects and contractor arc 
currently drawing up plans for the 
repairs, Cross said. Propo als arc 
even being made to upgrade the 
Che Cafe with modern conve-
niences such a Internet access. 

The $250,000 proposal to be 
voted on in the fa ll will not include 
plans for upgrades. 

If the revised student centers fee 
referendum is passed. work on the 
Che will begin immediately, Cross 
said.

check in the fu ture. Stephens said 
he refu ed the offer, ayi ng that

his credi t was no longer good with

restaurant. Poff said she advised 
that the publication itself file the 
lawsuit because the suit should 
remain in the hands of the students. 

Stephens added that the vast 
majority of advertisers pay for their 
space, only occasionally does his 
staff encounter case such a the 
Salsa Rio case. PROPOSAL: $8,000 plan will provide students with rides on the weekends She added that she supports the 

students' efforts and believes that 
the restaurant is wrong for not hav-
ing paid for the advertisement. 

By VIncent Gragnani 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council last ni ght 
approved the Triton Tax i plan. 
which will provide slUdents wi th a 
free ride to and from locations 
within a 10-mile radius or cam-
pus. 

The service. which will go into 
effect in the fall. will be available 
to student s on Friday and 

SalUrday nights. 
Although the service wi ll be 

I'ree, drivers will expect tips. The 
A.S. Council wi ll spend $8,000 
next year to fund the service 
through Pinky 's Taxi Company. 

A.S. Pre ident Tesh Khullar 
said he was pleased that the coun- . 
cil approved the plan. 

A.S . Vice President Jennifer 
Lee added that most council mem-

bers were in favor of the proposal. 
''The majority of the council 

was fo r it." Lee said. "We have 
some members that are very con-
cerned about increased alcohol 
usage." 

Some council members said 
they feared that if students were 
guaranteed a ride home, they 
may be more likely to dink in 
excess. 

"We tried," Poff said. "We gave 
them so many opportunities. They 
had ample time to pay." 

Stephens said that he spoke with 
. Tikam shortly after the summons 
was served. He said that he offered 
to dismiss the suit. immediately if 
Tikam would pay $170 cash. He 

"That 's not saying we' re going 
to put up with it ." Stephens said. 
"That's not saying students are 
going to put up with it ei ther. It 
kind of upsets me and we' re not 
going to let them get away with it." , 

Tikam was unavailable for COOl-
ment this week. The manager of 
Salsa Rio said that no one else 
would comment on the lawsuit.

find her location and beam her back to the planet Zag where she 
decides to go on an interplanetary tour with her new "EarthFood" 
cooking show. 

Heartbroken, Pierre offiCially changes his name to 
Pierre Appleseed and goes on a personal mission 

to cover the world in apple trees.

SURVEY: 
New committee is 

. formed for next year 
Continued from page 1 
laincd fees wi lh lOIS far from cam-
pus. 

The resulls of anolher queslion 
showed Ihal 50 pen.:ent of Ihose 
surveyed prefer a markel-based 
parking syslem in whi l.:h all types 
of permits would be avai lab le to all 
persons al di fferenl levels of cos I. 

Thirty-s ix percenl of Ihose sur-
veyed said Ihey preferred Ihe currenl 
syslem, in which eligibililY is based 
on Ihe sial us of Ihe driver. wilh fac-
ully having Ihe highe~t priorilY. 

The survey also found Ihal 60 
percenl of those surveyed are wi 11 -
ing 10 pay al leasl $2 per quarter to 
help provide alternali ve means of 
Iransportalion Ihal wi ll help lessen 
Ihe demand for parking spaces. 

Luskin said Ihat because a 
decreased demand for parking 
paces benefils everyone, alternalive 

means of transportation should be an 
important aspect of possible solu-
tions to parking problems al UCSD. 

"]The survey] shows that alter-
nali ve Iransportation is Ihe best 
Solulion to the parking problem," 
Luskin said. "It 's definitely overall 
Ihe beSI solulion. The only problem 
is Ihat it can only go so far." 

Luskin aid Ihat Ihe survey 
found thallhe parki ng problem also 
has a direci effeci on studenls' edu-
cation. Of those surveyed, 68 per-
cenl said Ihey have been late 10 a 
class or exam due 10 a lack of park-
ing. Fifty-eighl percent also said 
thai parking sometimes. often or 
always di scourages them from 
allending class. 

"It 's nOI jusl an inconvenience. 
It defini tely has an effect on educa-
lion," Luski n said of the results. 
"Parking affects people in ways 
you never Ihink about." 

The survey also found that if 

on-campu s fre shmen, re idenls 
were nOI allowed 10 have cars al 
UCS D, il wou ld nOI have draSlical-
I)' affecled studenls' decisions 10 
w me 10 UCS D. 

Of Ihose surveyed, 56 percent 
sa id such a policy wou ld have had 
no effeci on Iheir decision 10 come 
10 UCSD. Twenly-one percenl said 
Ihal such a policy would have made 
Ihem nOI come 10 UCS D. while 17 
percenl checked a box marked 
"olher." 

Luskin said that nlany of Ihose 
who chose "other" stated that nOI 
allow ing freshmen res idenls to 
have cars on campus would have 
had some effect on their decision to 
come to UCSD. but il would not 
have caused them to rule UCSD 
OUI. 

Luskin added Ihat many fresh -
men said such a policy would have 
prevented them from coming to 
UCSD while many second-, third-
and fourth-year students said such 
a policy would have lillie effeci on 
thei r decision. 

Lu kin said he and members of 
Ihe parking committee gathered the 
surveys from people riding the 
parking shullles, walking on 
Library Walk and other random 

The UCSD Guardian 

sources. 
A.S . President Tesh Khullar said 

that he has fornled a similar commit-
tee to work on parking issues next 
year. Both he and Luskin said Ihat 
Muir Junior Senalor Amy Boone 
will likely chair the comminee. 
Boone was a member of the com-
minee this year. Khullar added Ihal 
many people have expressed interesl 
in working on the commillee. 

Luskin said that he would have 
liked to have the opportunity to 
brainstorm new idea and analyze 
the data more, but hi s comminee 
ran out of time. He sugge ted that 
next year 's comminee look more 
into alternative means of trans-
portation. 

"I wou ld really like to see a 
study done on how alternative 
methods of transportation could be 
improved if a quarterly fee were 
enacted," Luskin said. "That is 
something I would like to see the 
commillee take on." 

Director of Parl..ing and 
Transportation Services Greg Snee 
was out for the week and therefore 
unavai lable to comment on the 
commillee's findings.

Cameras Gain Popularity 
TECHNOLOGY: Web cameras hit college campuses 
By Rudolph R. Wilson 
OSU Daily Barometer (Oregon State 
U.) 

(U-WIRE) CORVALLIS, Ore. 
- As technology advances, stu-
dents are finding more options 
open 10 Ihem in study, research 
and entertainment. The newest 
hardware to hit campuses is the 
web camera. 

Web cameras and digital cam-
eras have been around for awhile 
but have so far been used only by 
so-called lechnology junkies: 
people who buy the latest and 
greatest piece of hardware no 
mailer the price. Costs are finally 
lowering on web cameras and 
more people, including students 
at Oregon State University, are 
purchasing them to install on their 
home computer er laptops. 

The web camera allows a per-
son to view someone who also 
owns a web camera through their 
computers. The most common 
use of the camera is for challing 
with people all over the world. A 
separate window opens up that 
gives a view of whatever the cam-
era on the other end is pointed at: 
most often, a person. 

One student at OSU, who goes 
by the chat handle of " Bobi 
Miligiv," installed a web camera 
on hi s laptop at the beginning of 

this chool year. He uses it for 
what he calls "edutai nment." 

"Basically I can use it to talk 
to anyone with a camera on their 
end. Sometimes people set up 
their cameras in their room and 
let it run all day. " 

Right now about 50 sludents 
nationwide have set up their own 
personal "Truman Show"-type 
sets. They have the camera in 
their dorm room or apartment and 
updated images are sent to a serv-
er every five minutes or so. From 
the server, anyone on the web can 
peek in and see whal 's going on at 
a particular time. 

Some of the other options 
available with the camera 
include selling up multiple win ~ 
dows so that a person can see 
several other at once or selling 
up a server and lelli ng others 
connect and chat through it. A 
person can a lso choose to install 
an audio connection, so that not 
on ly can others see what the 
camera sees, but they can hear 
things as well. Overall quality of 
the image and sound often 
depends on the hardware of the 
computer and the quality of the 
camera. 

A web camera and software 
cost about $160. More expensive 
models can cost up to $600.

Three Golfers Drive to Graduation Two Fencers Depart 
Putting: golf team saying good-bye to three of its leaders Touche": Coach Lee must replace captains 
By John Maynard 
Sports Editor 

A score of 292 and a sccond-
place. national tinish combine to 
fonn UCSD's lowest team total 
ever for one round. marking not 
only the end of the season for the 
Triton golf team. but also the end -
of co llegiate golf for three n tahle 
UCSD seniors: Matt Cassarino. 
Kevin Petrie and Greg Johnson. 

Although the loss is great, the 
trio could not have asked for a 
better way to go out. After all , 
last month 's second-place linish 
at the CAA Di vision III 
National Championships in 
Willi amstown. Mass. was the 
highest fini sh by a UCS D golf 
team since 1993. 

Head Coach Mike Wydra 
attributes this year's success to 
the leadership and dedication of 
his three seniors. 

Wydra sa id that Cassarino's 
impeccable work ethic made him 
a team leader. When Cassarino 
li rst began his career at UCSD, he 
struggled, and in his junior year 
hiS troubles peaked as he fai led to 
qualify for the team. However. 
Cassari no worked hard and Wydra 
gave him another chance. 
Cassarino prevailed and earned 
himself a spot on the team. 

Petrie is another UCSD senior 
that earned respect from his 
teammates through hi s exem-
plary work ethic. His story is 

similar to Cassarino's. 
Wydra said that Petrie wa the 

sixth player on a five-man roster 
last year, which encouraged the 
senior to work even harder to 
earn a spot on the coveted live-
man roster. Petrie worked hard 
and attended every practice this 
year and earned not only a spot 
on the team, but also the role of 
team captain . 

One of Petrie 's career high-
lights came earlier this year at a 
tournament on the team's home 
course. Torrey Pines. Wydra said 
that Petrie parred the first 16 
hole consecutively, something 
no Triton had ever done. 
"There's no quit in him," Wydra 
said. 

Petrie continued to be strong 
all year and was UCSO's No. I 
golfer going into nationals. 

Johnson was another player 
that stuck out this year among 
UCSD golfers. As thi s year's 
team MVP as well as a UCSD 
Athlete of the Year, Johnson was 
the team's leader in terms of both 
score and morale. 

Like the other two eniors, 
Johnson golfed ex tremely well at 
nationals. He put his golden put-
ter to use during the opening half 
of the third round to shoot a tour-
nament best for nine holes: 3 
under par 32. Wydra said that this 
charge broke the ground for 
UCSD's lowest ever 292 team

Two much-loved senior 
fencers are hanging up their 
swords and saying goodbye to 
the UCSD fencing team. 

Peter Graham and Suneel 
Sundar both competed excellent-
ly this year and came out of the 
season with many awards and 
honors. Graham placed highly in 
the regional conference, and 
Sundar was recently awarded the 
highest academic award in athlet-
ics. 

Graham, a valuable member 
of the fencing team, brought 
experience and leadership to the 
team. Graham has a great attitude 
that was an encouragement to 
teammates. He was a sparkling 
role model for the younger 
fencers on the teani. He came 
away with second place in the 
regional conference in his event. 

"Always even-tempered, 
[Graham] set an example for the 
team of fierce competitiveness 
and good spon manship," said 
Head Coach Stuan Lee. 

Sundar also brought experi-
ence and leadership to the UCSD 
fencing team. Fencing for lour 
years, Sundar improved continu-
ally throughout his years of com-
peting for UCSD. 

Sundar has been loaded up 
with impressive honors this year. 
Not only is he a vcry talented

GPA which gained him academic 
honors at the athletic banquet. 

Leading the epee quad, 
Sundar was a favorite of both 
his teammates and his coach. 

"[Sundar] was a real team 
leader," said Lee. "His solid per-
formance on the fencing strip 
was rivaled by his popularity on 
the team and his 4.00 GPA." 

This vinually perfect athlctc 
will leave behind a large pair of 
shoes to till as he heads to the 
real world. He will also leavc

team.

ContIIIued frOID __ 24 
petitors about their ability to make 
up ground in a hurry. The crew 
team struggled at the beginning of 
the season. but by the end, many 
opponcnts lived in fear of it. With 
Mowrey helping her teammates, 
the varsity 4 was the sccond-
fastest. non-Pac 10 boat in the 
Pacific Coast Rowi ng 
Championships (PeRC). 

A three-year rowcr. Sara 
Sendzik returned thi s sea 'on from 
a year abroad in Spain. Despite 
the troubles of returning from thi s 
extended vacation to the grueling 
schedule of crew, Sendzik per-
formcd remarkably well. A former 
lightweight, she contributcd to the 
varsity S's ability to come from 
behind. In the second seat. there is 
a need for both techniquc and 
mental toughness. and Sendzik 
contributed both. She was an 

agg~essivc rower but still was 
committed to the team as a whole. 

"Sara was onc of those uniquc

Although crew is a spon that 

requires a lot of independence, it is 
still a learn spon. Mowrey and 
Sendzik both raised the levels of 
thosc placed around them and 
helped the women's crew team suc-
ceed. 

"I rer,lIy appreciate the ycars of 
effort they put in." Vallerga said. 
"They 'lut their individual goals 
and aspirations aside for the team's

are going to leave big holes after 
contributing to what was a great 
varsity year." 

On the men 's side. third-year

the team this year," Filippone said . 
"He had four so lid' years full of

Asbury was another captain of 
the team thi s season, as well as the 
lead oarsman for the varsity 8 boat. 
Last season, Asbury suffcred from 
a torn tendon in his knce that limit-

Team will miss big

hurt by the loss of Chris Swartz. 

wartz was the team 's be t javelin 
throwers until an early injury ended 
his javelin career. However, the 
injury did not keep wartL. from 
hecoming one of the team 's best 
hammer throwers and a team 
leader. 

"Swartz was a dynamic force on 
the team. He brought a lot of ener-
gy wi th his com'petitive spirit. " 
Gieskes said. " He had a strong sea-
son even though he couldn't com-
pete in his best event." 

The throwing squad wi ll be fur-
ther hurt by the loss of Dan 
Paredes. Paredes. a dedicated and 
tireless worker, was the team's 
most consistent javelin thrower 
throughout the season. 

Ryan Friegang's departure will 
al 0 leave a void in the team. 
Friegang's diversity was a key ele-
ment on the team. as he was the 
best 110 meter hurdles runner as 
well as the team 's top high jumper. 

Other contributors to the suc-
cess of the team's jumping program 
include Winston Lien. who became 
the team's most consistent jumper, 
and Tom Hunt. who brought depth 
to the high jump event. 

The Triton running team will 
also be hurt by losses of key per-
formers. One of the toughest losses 
to the team wi ll be the departure of 
Steve Varnell. One of the Tritons' 
most consistent runners. Varnell 
was the team ' top 10.000 meter 

Dan Pared •• : 
A javelin 
specialist, Dan 
was one of the 
team 's most 
dedicated and 
stable 
athletes . 

Ryan

Ryan excelled 
all season and 
became the 
team 's best 
110 meter 
hurdler and 
high jumper. 

runner as well a ' the team' second 
fastest 5,000 meter runner. 

Another big loss to the team 
will be that of Kevin Prindiville. A 
leader through performance and 
attitude, Prindi vi lle had a tremen-
dous season. se tting personal 
records in the 1,500 meter, 3,000 
meter and 5,000 meter events dur-
ing the track season. He was al 0 a 
big contributor during the team's 
appearance in the National 
Championships. 

Another hig- time athlete for 
both the cross country and track 
teams was Jason Wi skerchcn. 
Wiskerehen overcame injuries to 
become a key runner in the 400-
meter hurdle and to cam AII -
Conference honor during the con-
ference championships. 

The Tritons will also be with-
out Hamed Aryafar. Aryafar was 
hampered by injuries for much of 
the season but was able to over-
come them at the end of the sea-
son with a successful run of the 
steeplechase. 

Another great team player for 
the Tritons on both tlie cros 
country team and the track team 
was Steve Wal h. Wal sh put 
together a great season, ending 
wi th a personal record In the 
3000-meter steeplechase in the 
las t run of his career. 

The women stand to 10 e com-
paratively fewer athletes, but the 
impact from the loss of these ath-
letes is no less ignificant. 

The women' throwing team 
wi ll be hurt by the loss of Christi 

orton. Norton returned after a 
one-year hiatus to become the

team's best discus thrower and the 
second best shot and hammer 
thrower. A diverse athlete, Norton 
was one of the team 's hardest 
workers, her team career culminat-
ing with her appearance at the 
lational Championships in the dis-

cu . 
Another key performer for the 

team 'was Heather Winberry. 
Winberry was the team's best high 
jumper, as well as a big contributor 
in the triple jump and the long 
jump. 

Another big loss to the team will 
be felt, as Ulrike Katerkamp has also 
linished her track career. Katerkamp 
competed in three events for the 
Tritons, the 200, 400 and 800 
meters. Katerkamp added much 
depth to the running team as well as 
a competitive spirit. 

The loss of Lucia Mokres will 
leave a big hole to be filled next 
year. Mokres was the team 's best 
10,000 meter runner as well as 
one of the hardest workers. In her 
final run, Mokres set a personal 
best in the 10,000 meter by an 
astounding 50 seconds. 

Another competitor that will 
be missed from the cross-country 

tea~ is Kri ste~Koenig . Koenig 
supplied a spark to the team and 
was one of the toughest Tritons to 
beat when she put together a good 
race. 

A a whole. this collection of 
seniors proved to have all the com-
ponent needed to lead the younger 
Tritons by their examples of dedi-
cation. 

"These seniors were a focused 
group of athletes that understood

SWEET: 
Athletic Director discusses 
her career and plans 
ContInued rro. ..... A24 
Student Affairs Joseph Watson started talking 
with us about taking it off the backburner and 
developing a plan for making the move to 
Division n. Since that time we have put 
together a plan. We have talked with the 
California Collegiate Athletic Association 
(CCAA) about membership into that confer-
ence. We've had a review done by the NCAA 
as to what we need to do to make sure that we 
make the move in lal smooth and correct way. 

You' re well aware of the discussions that 
have taken place with the academic senate 
and the process of their review. All of those 
things came together last fall. So we had all 
the approvals, we had a visit from the CCAA 
as to their considering us for membership, and 
I'm optimistic that when I attend those con-
ferences next week that we'll get an aflirma-
tive response from them- that yes, they want 
us to be a member of the conference, and 
we'll join the conference next August. 

TH: So, we ' re not in the conference yet? 
JS: We' re an associate member of the con-

ference. Cross country and track and field 
have been associate members of the CCAA 
for a number of years. BUI that doesn 't give us 
voting priVileges, and obviously our other 
sports haven' t had the benefits of competing 
in conference. 

TH: When will we move up to Division 
II? 

JS: We will move to Division II in August 
of the year 2000. 

TH: When we do that, what kinds of 
changes can we expect? 

JS: One of the most allractive perks of 
joining a conference is that in {he sports that 
the conference sponsors you have a set sched-
ule. Depending on the number of institutions 
that sponsor the sport and whether the confer-
ence structures a double round robin, a single 
round rohin or a North-South division, that 
gives you "X" number of contests against 
other conference schools. Then you can fill in 
where there arc' non-conference opportunities. 

That 's one of the pluses that will remove 
some of the challenges coaches have faced 
when trying to put together a schedule. 

Another great plus is to play for a confer-
ence championship, which just puts a whole 
other clement into the excitement of what 
every competition needs. In the past. all the 
teams were really gearing up for being select-
ed to the NCAA Championships. 

TH: And it was always a risk, you didn ' t 
know. 

JS: It was a selection process Ithat! had a 
lot of suhjectivity. Now it will be when you 
do well. in the conference. you go to the con-
ference championship. Win the conference 
championship and you should have an oppor-
tunity to go to the NCAA championships. 

I also think the fact that we will he com-
peting with other state universities that arc 
more like us will allow for some natural rival -
ries that should generate a lot of interest in our 
student body. I think it 's a win-win situation. 
I know the conference is anxious to have us as 
a member, they think we bring a lot to the 
conference. 

TH: Hopefully. The next natural question 
is: Are we going to be able to compete? 

JS: I think that some sports will find it eas-
ier to be compelitive right at the start. Without 
trying to speculate which sports they are, I 
think there are those ihat are going to be com-
petitive immediately and others that will 
probably have greater challenges because 
every other conference member offers athlet-
ic scholarships. In those sports where they 
offer a full complement of scholarships and 
we're not offering any scholarships, we'll 
have a delinite disadvantage when it comes to 
recruiting. 

So, if we're recruiting against Davis for a 
basketball player and the student has the 
option of gelling a UC education and having 
it paid for, or gelling a UC education in San 
Diego, which would certainly bring a 101 of 
pluses, but they would have to pay for it .... 

tH: II might change the balance. 
JS: Exactly. They may choose to have 

The UCSD Guardian SPORTS A23 

their educatioo.paid for. 
TH: What about a leam like the men's vol-

leyball squad that plays in the Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation? 

JS: They're not a part of the CCAA 
because there are so few Division U volley-
ball programs. In fact, I think there may be 
only one other CCAA member that has men' 
volleyball as a varsity sport. We're in the 
process of trying to determine what 's going to 
make the most sense for the men's volleyball 
program in the future. They're in a similar sit-
uation to water polo and fencing in that 
there's only one open NCAA Championship, 
and they compete with Division I, Division II 
and Division III. Typicalty, the Division I 
schools dominate for expected reasons. 

Water polo has the benefit of having the 
Weslern Water Polo Association 
Champion hip, with the champion gelling an 
automatic bid to the NCAA champion hip. 
That 's been a real boost to that sport. and vol-
leyball and fencing don 't have that. 

TH: What 's going on with the athletic 
department 's view on cholarships? 

JS: The athletic department can't deter-
mine whether there's going to be scholarships 
or not. So I think the overriding question is: 
how does UCSD feel about athletic scholar-
ships? 

Part of the discussion with the academic 
senate was its very strong opposition to ath-
lelic scholarships. 

TH: That's tough. That 's going to make it 
hard on you guys. 

JS: It's going to make it more challenging 
than it would be. 

TH: OK, so what about the economics of 
the move? I would assume it's going to cost 
more for travel and the like. Is it going to be a 
strain'! How is it going to be handled? 
. JS: It will have additional financial osts 

associated with it, given that the conference 
has half of it s membership in Northern' 
Calif~rnia . And under the previou slructure. 
a team may take one trip to Northern 
California that we would try to assist them 
with . 

TH: Now everyone's going to go up. 
JS: Now everyone in the conference will 

he going, although it will be a different num-
ber of times - hut they ' ll he going. We feel 
very strongly that since the move to Division 
II was a university decision and the joining of 
the conference was a university decision, that 
we shouldn't put any more pressure on the 
student athleles and coaches that they hav_e to 
do the fund-raising to make this work. So 
we' re looking at a number of different ways 
that we can provide the linancial support, and 
I'm optimistic that they'll be helped. 

TH: Good. That 's good. I was worried 
about that. I didn't know what the Academic 
Senate was going to do about that stuff. 

JS: Well. the academic senate really isn't 
involved with the financial part of it. That 
falls under the student affairs umbrella. I 
know that Vice Chancellor Watson is very 
much committed to helping us do this the 
right way. 

TH: I abo wanted to tell you that we have 
your picture in our oflice of when you made 
the front page of USA Today. It's got to be an 
honor, isn' t it, to be such a recognized athlet-
ic director? -

JS: I have been very fortunale in my 
career, first of all working at UCSD and hav-
ing the opportunity to be director of athletics. 
Gelling involved with the NCAA, having the 
opportunity to be presiclent of the NCAA and 
most importanlly, working with such terrilic 
staff and student-athletes at UCSD and ('.01-
lectively being able to achieve what we h,we 
over lhe past couple of years. 

TH: You're pretty happy, huh? 
JS: It's prelly awesome to me. I don't 

know another athletic director in the country 
that has had the distinction of going through a 
human tunnel. I Editor's Note: Sweet is refer-
ring to the lilli/IOn tunnel the athletes made for 
her to run through at last Wednesday's 
Athletics Recognition Night./ 

TH: So, now what are you going to do? 
Are you going to go back into the faculty? 

JS: I am looking at whal options go along 
with going back to a faculty posilion. We're 
discussing what opportunities there might be. 
Hopefully, I'll have more definitive informa-

4 Coed Volleyball PlayoHs Under Way 
RIMAC was alive with the first rounds of playoff action last night. Results were not available at press 

time, but rest assured tonight's semis & finals double headers will test the campus' best volleyball talent. 
. At the top level, Coed AAA, ORGANIZED CONFUSION and DA GOONIES 

~ should lock up in the finals. They played in the first week of the season with CONFUSION squeezing out a 2· t match win. Both squads have all the ingredi-ents. They can pass, have quality setters and once-in-a-while they can pound \lG1.ybaI1 one down on the to-foot line. And, neither team really had much trouble with 
" anyone else playing at this level. Can someone else get to the finals? An upset? 

Not likely. Look for CONFUSION to take home the crown in a close final. 
The lwo top teams in the intermediate division look to be the class of the field, but there is plenty of 

quality talent in this playoff bracket. NumbE1r t ranked, AT&T should have had no problem with SHE'S THE 
FRANCHISE last night, but the fun starts at 8pm tonight. AT&T will get either VSA or BALLERS in the 
semis. Both squads are rock solid and of championship caliber. This should be a great match. If the number 
2 seed, TURTLES, don't gel through to the finals, watch out for GETIING' DIGGY WID IT who could sneak 
up and steal th is one at the wire. 

When you have it cooking on the court, it should go pass, set, spike - point. Well, at the Coed A level it 
doesn't always go that way. It's more like shank, throw. net violation - side out. But no-one in 1M's is having 
more fun than the crazy's that play at this level. Sorting out the playoffs is yet another challenge. Who can 
beat TEAM PABST LIVES!? Great volleyball, great suds! Let's engrave the trophy now. Of course DIG 
DUG and SPIKED PUNCH might want to join the party, but c'mon. Let's finish the year with a champion 
that knows what to drink when it's time to celebrate. 

Tube-Polo Champions Crowned 
Coed AAA .. . Mi K ... 1" w.ter R ... 8 

This final was a classic matchup of the upset kids and the top ranked squad. David and Goliath! MI KASA 
has been close in the past, but always seemed to find a way to come out second, or worse. This quarter it 
was going to be different. They finally beat bitler rival SPARTICUS in league play and entered the playoffs as 
the top seed. . 

The WATER RATS struggled at times during the regular season, but obviously they found the winning 
formula in the playoffs. Led by several stars who spend mosl of their time face down in the water at Canyonview, 
they feature a balanced scoring attack and aggressive defense. They ran over Jason Fairchild and Co. (greal run though Jason) in the semis and dug in for the title game. 

The RATS got up quickly 7-3at the half, but whatever was said in the locker room 
at halftime didn't work. They could only find the back of the goal once in the second 
half. That wasn't golng to be enough as Natalie Pohoho and Amir Sami keyed a 
furious rally thallotaled 8 second ha~ points for the 11-8 final. 
Coed AA ... G-Hou .. " Bandito. 7 

Both of lhese squads struggled during league play, but found the waters much calmer in the AA playoff 
bracket. This championship was close in the first half as both teams came out with intense offensive minded 
game plans. G-HOUSE took a 6·4 lead into halftime. 

The BANDITOS knew that they would have to slow down the scoring duo of Tom Gros and Trevor 
Shellon ff lhey were going to get back inlo the game. And, they got that task taken care of. Neither scored in 
the second ha~. tn fact it was tube-polo veteran Erin Knipe who scored their lone second half goal (and as it 
tumed out winning goal) for G-HOUSE. tl was barely enough. 

Gabe Casas tallied two second haH goats and Louie Wong put the biscuit in the basket once, bul that left 
BANDfTOS one short. Desp~e an all-oul effort down· the-stretch they just couldn't get their hands on the ball 
long enough to get 011 a quatity shot. Ouch, coming up one short hurts. 
Coed A ... AIIergic.., W.., IS, Almond Joy 6 

This one WIIS a dassic old-fashioned, out behind the woodshed, whoop'n. ALLERGIC's Nick Pullin took 
home player of the game honors acoounling for 6 first half goals en route to an 8 point night. 

ALMOND JOy just didn't have any answers. Lisa Parry led the way with 4 of their 6 point totat, but after 
going down 11-2 after the first period il became apparent that the Tsunami was 100 big too slow down. 
Congratulations coach Fairchild, we'lt see how ~ is In the rough walers of AA for this squad next year.

Reward: Judith Sweet looks with admiration at a poster portraying the achievements of the '97-'98 athletes 

t 
pioneering archite tin UCSD' move to NCAA Di\~ ion II athletics,Judith Sweet will hold 

a special place in UCSD port history 

By Travis Hill 
Associate Sports Editor 

UCS D's Director of Athletics Judy Sweet will resign 
at the end of the school year. She ha~ been the head of 
Tri ton athletics for 24 year~ and has been at the helm for 
everyone of C D's National Championships. 

In 1997-98. she accepted the Scars Directors' Cup as 
UCSD was named the top athletic program in Division 
III. However. she will perhaps be remembered most for 
being one of the key architects in UCSD's move to 
NCAA Di vision II. 

In thi s interview. Sweet talked with the Guardian s 
Travis Hill about the details of the move. UCSD' future 
in athletics and her own plans for the future. 

Travis Hill : I don 't really know a lot of the details 
about the move to Division II and I wanted to discuss 
some of them wi th you. So. I guess the first thing is, 
when did you guys decide to make the move up? 

. 

Judy Sweet: I've talked ahout movi ng up to 
Di vis ion II for a number of years with the primary reason 
heing that we were so different from all of the other 
Di vision III schools, and the other Di vision III schools 
kept reminding us about that. 

We ' re a large public uni versi ty and HO percent of the 
schools in Division III are small , private in ·titutions with 
average enrollments of about 1,500. There are very few 
Di vision III schools west of the Missi. sippi . The ones 
that are in California belong to the Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, again full of small, 
private sc hools - very different from us. . 

At one point in our history we applied for member-
ship in that conference because we felt that it was so 
important to be a part of a conference, and we were very 
courteously told that we didn ' t lit. So, since that time 
we' ve been an independent and have had tremendous 
challenges in trying to schedule competition and to find 
other institutions that are similar to us, with which we 
could compete. 

Division III has put increasingly more emphasis on 
conference affiliation . ext year. they will award all con-
ferences automatic bids to all of the team sport national 
championships. That will make it even more difficult for 
our teams to be given consideration si nce there will he 
ve ry few slots left for independent schools. 

Going back to when we -tared thinking about this, I 
would say the first official review was done in the early 
I 990s, maybe even in the late ' 80s. There was, in fact. a 
recommendation from the Intercollegiate Recreation 
Athletic Advi sory Committee to the chancellor, through 
the vice chancellor of student affairs, that UCSD should 
move to Division II. The unfortunate timing [duri ng] the 
early '90s) presented some real financial challenges. and 
because of those financial challenges the chancellor 
decided that it wouldn't be the right time for u to con-
tinue to pursue a move to Division II. So, it was basical-
ly tabled.

---I LAST. WORDS FROM GUARDIAN SENIORS t---__. 

Ann Barefield 8USIN~ MANAGER 
My time at UCSD will be 

over in a few months. My 
impending move and the fact that 
graduation is a few shon days 
away has caused me to reflect 
back on fond memories of my 
own graduation from UC Davis 
four years ago. 

ft was 8 a.m. on a beautiful 
Sunday morning and my hung-
over bOdy was contentedly sleep-
ing away. I was supposed to be 
lined up with my fellow gradu-
ates preparing to march into cer-
emonies promptly at 9 a.m. 
Luckily, the gods of graduation 
ceremonies were smiling on me. 
My boyfriend stopped by my 
house to get me out of bed at 
8:30 a.m. I don't know how, but I 
made it to my graduation cere-
1'I\0ny and I even looked pretty 
'Cute - I have the pictures 10 
prove it 

The day progressed pretty 
smoothly for the next three 
hours. William Bennett, U.S. sec-
retary of education, gave a nice 
speech. Although I have no idea 
what actually he said, I believe it 
was something about the future, 
making the most of everyday and 
helping out society - a typical 
graduation pep talk. Somehow, I 
managed to walk across the stage 
with grace and without tripping 
on my robe, falling off the stairs 
or vomit:ng on anyone. In addi-
tion, my incredibly large family 
was able to take some lovely 
photos without anyone having to 
go to the emergency room or file 
for divorce. 

Within days of my graduation 
I packcd up everything I owned 
and moved back to my home-
lown of San Diego 10 begin 
working at Ihe UCSD Guardian 

as the full-time advenising man-
ager. I was on my way to a great 
career and I was excited. 

One year earlier, after years of 
soul searching, I decided I want-
ed a career working in the adver-
tising and business end of print 
media. At the time, I thought Ihis 
was a field that would fulfill my 
career ambitions. I would be 
working in business but at the 
same time facilitating journal-
ism. 

Print media would allow me 
to come to work every day for 
the next 40 plus years knowing 
that my job made il possible for 
others to provide the public with 
valuable information and to be 
the public's government watch-
dog. One day, I was going 10 be 
the business manager of a nation-
al publishing group. This belief 
gave me comfon and satisfac-
tion. 

My future was set and the past 
had been put to rest when they 
called my name on that gradua-
tion stage. Not only had I decid-
ed on clear goals, I actually had a 
real job before I graduated. I was 
also elated because I knew I 
never had to write another paper, 
take another midterm, get wait 
listed for another class or kiss 
~r TA's ass. And how hard 
could working full-time be? Mil-
lions of other people do it, no 
problem, I thought. 

I calculated that at 40 hours 
per week I would actually have 
more free time. I added up all 
the hours I spent working, 
studying and going to class. 
Even on slow week in college I

WORDS FROM GUARD/AN SENIORS ~---n 
c===== 

Jake Gordon 
My high school graduation 

seemed to go on forever. One dis-
tinguished speaker after anolher 
droned on and on about working 
hard in life and (;ollege. We were 
teenagers. weaned on video 
games and commercial breaks, 
itching to celebrale our new 
found freedom. It wasn't easy 10 
take. Finally someone hroke Ihe 
monolony. A speaker slood up 
and gave il to us straight He had 
a top len list of advice he wanted 
10 give us. h was good advice. 

While I can't remember all of 
it, one pan of Ihe list sticks in my 
mind: No.5 - Live off your par-
ents as long as you can. 

"I rushed through Harvard in 
three years," the speaker said. 
"Now I sit back and ask 'why did 
I do thatT I think I must have 
missed a lot" 

My parents went to Wood-

Mary Higgins 
Not to brag or anything, but I 

when it came to Warren Writing I 
was star of the class. I also 
excelled at Conversationaillalian 
and Gospel Choir. 

That's where my academic 
claim to fame ends, unless there's 
some son of award for "Graduat-
ing With The Lowest Possible 
GPA" or "Needing Both Hands 
To Count Number Of F's On 
Transcript." With my GPA, I think 
we've established that I won't be 
this year's valedictorian. 

But don't feel sony for me. 
I've had a more colorful college 
career than most (and after five 
years, I think you can truly call il a 
"career"). My grades don'l reflect 
it, but I've Ieamed a lot at UCSD. 
Ironically, I think I Ieamed the 
most from the tasks at which I've 
failed: tests, relationships, pr0-
jects. jobs ... the list is endless.

stock. pan of Ihe baby boomer 
general ion of 'the I 960s. Their 
wild days behind Ihem, I was 
raised in an idyllic New Jersey 
suburb, before moving on up to 
California in 10th grade. My dad 
worked and my mom stayed al 
home. They always wanted the 
beSI for me. All my life, I've 
always assumed I would end up 
working someday. We all did. Yet 
il was always up to debate. 
Career choices like dOClor and 
fireman soon gave way 10 movie 
producer and superstar athlete. 
which have now faded away into 
many more realislic propositions. 

When I eschewed science for 
a communications route early in 
my college career, my mom said, 
"You can do what you want but 
all the money is in science these 
days." 

Money: h's what it all seems 

l've learned that no matter 
how hard you work, sometimes 
you don't succeed. I've learned 
that even if you have enough tal-
ent and discipline to get to the 
top of your field, you won't sCay 
there forever - superlatives like 
"Best" and "Smanest" only last 
as long as a mosquito's life span. 

I've learned it takes a split 
second to build trust and only a 
millisecond to break it. With my 
friends, I've shared the grief and 
sadness of losing a peer ... for 
some of us it was our first close 
experience with death. 

These are the hard lessons of 
life. No one is graduating from 
this school quite the same person 
they were when they got here. 

I get angry when people make 
Ihe flippant or condescending 
comment, "You'll understand 
when you're out in the real 

to come down 10. I feel like 
we've been fed .he same Sluff as 
our parents. children of WWII 
velerans in lhe "Father Knows 
Best" era. Yet now we're laughl.

10 make money 10 have a 
respeclable life and yel slill do 
somelhing we'd like 10 do. 

Problem is Ihal 1 don'l like 10 
do anything. AI all. Evcr. 

Unless someone will pay me 
to sit on the sofa and walch 
spons, I don' l Ihink I'll gel my 
dream job. When I was lillie, I 
just assumed I would love what I 
was doing. Now I've gOllen more 
practical. When I switched 
majors back there in '96, I told 
my parents I would become a 
lawyer. ThaI seemed to salisfy 
Ihem enough 10 leI me get oUI of 
O-chem, and il bought me a cou-
ple years of fantaslic college 
experiences. Somehow I slum-
bled into journalism and got this 
job at lhe paper. Yet I kept my 
course to law school. 

Law school sounds so great h 
sounds so importanl and presli-
gious. h also sounds like a whole 
lot of work . When I look Ihe 
LSAT, I was kind of expecting to 
fail. Then I racked the damn 
thing and applied 10 all Ihese 
fancy colleges wilh ivy on Iheir 
gated enlryways. 

Every step in Ihe process was 
like a small compelition. I wanl-
ed to win really bad, but then 
when I did, I realized [ had to go 
on to Ihe nexl step. Somebody 
tricked me. All of a sudden, I had

world." Many of us go 10 school 
full time and work one or more 
jobs. Some of us havc children 
and spouses. Surrounded by com-
petilion, working in close quar-
ters, toughing it oulthrough group 
projects ... we are immersed in Ihe 
real world everyday, dealing wilh 
the issues of prejudice, heartache, 
loneliness and fear. 

Yes, I think college is about as 
real as you can gel. Sound gruel-
ing? There are kinder - but not 
necessarily easier - lessons that 
I've learned. My friends have 
taught me the value of loyalty. 
I've watched my parents make 
endless sacrifices so I could be 
here; from them I've learned 
palience and selflessness. I'm 
stronger, older, and hopefully a 
little bit wiser. I'm proud of who 
I've become. This endeavor has 
not been a waste of time. 

Years ago in my high school 
econ class, I sat down the aisle 
from the guy who was in the Guin-
ness Book of World's Records for 
Youngest College Graduate. He 
had graduated from UCSC at the 
age of 12, then returned to high 
school so he could lead a "normal" 
life. He also happened to be kind 
of cute so I used to throw carrots 
and other miscellaneous lunch 

. items at him to get his attention. 
In the midst of such genius, 

most people gauge their success 
by comparing themselves to the 
best and the brightest, like Mr. 
World Book. I don't I'm still the 
kid in the back of the classroom 
who stms food fights. It's on the 
way to the principal's office tilat 
I've learned some of life's mOSI 
interesting lessons.

B4 SUMMER & GRADUATION SPECIAL The UCSD Guardian Thursday. June 3. 1999 

LAST WORDS FROM GUARDIAN SENIORS t-----~-...., 

Travis Hill 
Oh. the irony: my last column doesn't 

even go on the sports page. Ahh, such is 
life; seems like this whole college roller 
coaster hasn't taken any of the correct 
turns, yet somehow I always end up OK. 

So, this is it. This will be my final con-
tribution to this newspaper, because I am 
graduating to real life in two weeks. Wait, 
what? What the hell am I saying? 

I don't want to go! I don't want to be 
real yet. As a matter of fact, I don't ever 
want to be real. Reality is pushing papers, 
fighting traffic and kissing ass. And as we 
all know, I just described hell on Earth for 
the Coach. 

I LIKE being a student. I am not one of 
those people who is so happy to be leaving 
this "awful" place. I have enjoyed UCSD 

mo~ than I could have possibly imagined. 
It has been so unbelievably fun. I mean, 
classes weren't the greaIeSt, but if that's the 
price I have to pay to get all the fun stuff in 
between, sign me up for another quarter! 

UCSD gets such a bad rap. Ever since I 
got here aliI have heard is negative com-
ments: "We have no spirit," "State has 10 
times more fun than we do" and my 
favorite, "Man, this place just sucks." 

So, as most of you know, I have made it 
my mission to show people that this place 
has all the ingredients of being a tremen-
dously fun place, it's just the negative pe0-
ple that suck. I know thatI've been harsh on 
you guys in the past, but honestly, how far 
does whining get you? If you look, and 
maybe put a little effort into finding it, I 
swear that good times exist at UCSD. 

That's why my columns became a 
haven for wild stories of amazing adven-
tures. The newspaper was my outlet. I 
made people listen to my point. 

Ahh, da Coach. What a fun column. For 
those of you who read it, I think we all had 

a good time. It was great to have some-
thing like that. For the true fans of sports 
and professional journalism, I know the 
columns devolved into a kind of drunken 
soap opera, but come on: you know you 
still laughed every now and then. 

When I started here way, way back in 
the day, making a mockery of sports writ-
ing was not my intention. However, when 
I started school I was lucky enough to 
know what I wanted to do: write sports. It 
was just that easy. Somehow, I always 
knew. Kind of like how Princess Leia 
always knew she was Luke's sister. 

When I stumbled into the Guardian 
office begging for work, I knew that I want-
ed to make some kind of a difference. I 
wanted to leave an impression on the school. 
I think I achieved my mission. I know I can't 
take any real credit for the move up to Divi-
sion D, but that was the kind of change I 
wanted to be a part of, and I am proud to 
have done my best to help. I also can't take 
any credit for Triton fan.~ setting the all-time 
RIMAC attendance record this season 
either, but I'm glad I was involved. In 20 
years, I won't be able to look back on a sin-
gle column - triumphs like that are the 
things I willloolt back on with pride. 

You know, it's fuMY, it seems like all I 
do in my column is talk about me and my 
misadventures, but when it comes down to 
talking about how I'm really feeling right 
now, I'm not very good at it. 

I mean, it's nearly impossible to take 
four of the greatest years of my life and 
describe them in one liule column. There 
are too many amazing tbings. I still remem-
ber how my empty donn room smelled on 
my first day. I remember not being able to 
sleep that first night because I was so over-
whelmed with the prospects for the future. 

I am so happy that I got out of bed and 
made myself have the greatest time of my 
life. I have alwlYs been determined to seek 
out good times and things that will make 
my mind, body and soul happy. That, ·more 
than anything I learned in a class, will help 
me when I have to become real. Of course, 
that's if you consider trying to fool some 
newspaper or magazine into giving me 
money to write about sports being real. 

Anyway, ifl have to leave you guys with 
one thing, it's this: Get out of bed and make 
yourself happy. Because I guarantee you 
guys, you can be filthy rich and unhappy. 
You can finally score with some incredibly 
hot guy or girl and still not be happy. You 
can do what society tells you to do all damn 
day and come home and find yourself upset. 

I just found what made me happy and 
did it. In my case, it happens to be watch-
ing sports with a cold beer and some wise-
ass friends. OK, so I think that's it, I'm 
done. The Coach is finally out. 

Laura Knighten 
As I breathe a sigh of relief at the 

prospect of graduating and rencct on the 
lessons I have learned while attending 
UCSD, I realize that the highlight of my 
college career was actually going away. 
During my junior year I studied in Cork, 
which is in the southwest of Ireland. It 
was, to say the least, a year filled lessons 
both in and out of the classroom - the 
first of which was the difference between 
Irish and American. 

They say we speak the same language, 
but I have my doubts. You can imagine, for 
example, how taken aback I was when my 
flatmaleS said to me one evening, "We're 
going out. There's good craic on tonight. 
Do you want to join us?" I Jeamed right 
then and there that craic meant "fun," not 
the illegal substance I was envisioning. 

It was year sulTOUnded by einotion. I 
cried when I left San Diego because I was 
leaving behind my family and friends. Yet. 
as hard as it was to leave the staIeI in the 
first place, it was even more difficult to 
return. The night before I left Ireland, I 
was up the entire night sobbing because I 
didn't want to leave. -Somewhere along the 
way, my life had transformed. What had 
for months seemed just like a 'break' from 
what was waiting for me back home had 
become my 'real' life. I had fallen in love 
with Ireland - with the countryside, with 
that brilliant shade of green that I just can't 
quite describe and with the nights of 
enjoying the craic in the pubs. I had fallen 
in love with my new friends and my new 
university, as well as the constant adven-
tures of navigating a new culture, new 
relationships and a new landscape. 

Academically, it wasn't until I experi-
enced the Irish university system that I 
really learned that college wasn't just 
about checking completed assignments off 

an ever-expanding to-do list. Everything in 
Ireland runs at a much slower pace -
including the university. Some courses last 
a year, and instead of being told what to 
read for every lecture, you are given a 10-
12-page reading list and told to "find your 
own way." Within this system, students 
cover a few topics in great depth rather 
than just touching the surface of many. 
Personally, I found a chance to relax a lit-
tle bit, to take a breath and to enjoy the lit-
erature I was reading. 

In Ireland, I really found my passion for 
literature and writing. I remember at one 
point thinking that I would be totally 
happy just to spend every afternoon and 
evening alone in my room just reading. Of 
course, that would have been a waste of an 
opportunity. So I compromised and put the 
books down in the evening and took them 
with me whenever I hopped on a bus to 
explore some other part of the country. 

In Ireland, I discovered what scholar-
ship really should be about-not good 
grades and doing all the required reading. 
It is about actively engaging in and pursu-
ing knowledge about a topic that is vit.ally 
important and highly interesting to you. 
lbose who aren't graduating have the best 
of the academic world accessible to you 
right now: UCSD has a tremendous library 
system, a large faculty and world-renown 
research. I have been fortunate to find an 
outlet for my interests through a Ulysses 
class, an honors thesis about Irish litera-
ture (It's finally done!) and my work on 
the newspaper. Whatever your passion 
may be, find it and get involved. 

You don't have to go to the extreme of 
travelling thousands of miles away in 
order to find I passion, but I encourase 
you to make sure that you find one. It has 
made my remaining time at UCSD so 
much more enjoyable and fulfilling. 

Likewise, while finding I pillion in 
your academic career is the wly to have 
fun in the classroom - take the Irish 
advice to, as they say, enjoy the craie out-
side as well. Find opportunities to relax 
and see if what you have Jearned actually 
works in the real world. 

I've learned the importance of viewing 
one's time at UCSD as an opportuaity that 
should be enjoyed, not an obligation to be 
fulfilled. Work hard, talk to your profes-
sors, utilize every resource that this uni-
versity provides you (you are plying for 
it, anywlY) and, of course, study abroad if 
you can. But in the mad rush of the quar-
ter system and the pressure to succeed, 
don't Jose sight of enjoying yourself both 
in and out of the classroom. Thanks for 
the memories, UCSD. I wish you III the 
best of luck in finding the craic in your 
own lives. 

ANN: 
First year out of col- . 
lege was miserable 
ContInued frOlll ..... B2 
spent far more than 40 hours per 
week devoted to the pursuit of 
higher knowledge. 

The best part was, I was moving 
back to beautiful San Diego. No 
more Davis rain, no more mud, no 
more 100 plus degree summers. 
Davis was a great place for school, 
but after being born and raised in 
San Diego, living with weather is 
hard. But no more. 72 degree 
weather, with a slight chance of 
morning and evening clouds. here I 
come. Life was good. 

and my family started lect,,"ng me 
about saving for retirement. Money 
was a constant problem. , 

I hated coming to work every-
day. In the first year I worlred at the 
Guardian, I came to the devastat-
ing conclusion that the print media 
business was definitely not the 
career for me. 1 interviewed at sev-
eral other newspapers. I decided I 
couldn't stand the other people in 
my field. I got the impression from 
various job interviews that people 
working in newspaper and maga-
zine advertising sales view the non-
ad content of their publications as 
filler between the ads. 

Until I got out of college, I 
never had too much trouble finding 
a date. It seemed impossible to 
meet new people after college. Col-
lege was so structured. In Davis, I 
met people constantly through 
classes, work and student organiza-
tions. 

If you need 
company, call 
someone or go visit 
a frI.nd. If the last 
till ... yOil want I. to 
talk to someone, 
don't answer the 
phone. Uvl.., by 
you .... 1f I. a self. 
centered lifestyle, 
but It doesn't hurt 
anyone ..... It'. 
great. 

My roommate was a neurotic 
neat freak with an even more neu-
rotic cat named Doobie. Doobie 
had an adorable habit of puking up 
hair balls every night. 11le cat's 
name combined with my room-
mates neatness and her habit of 
farting every chance she got, 
should give you a clue into her 
bizarre personality. 

In addition, many of my friends 
were depressed. Our lives could be 
described as the inspiration for the 
'Friends' theme song. You know, 
"Your life's a joke, you're broke, 
your love life's DOA ..... Unfortu-
nately, none of us had really cool 
furniture, amazing apartments or 
naked guys in the next building to 
spy on. 

ness manager of the GUlJrriian, I 
feel privileged to facilitate an envi-
ronment whe·re students can earn a 
paycheck and gain skills that help 
them get jobs after graduation. 
Also, my savings and checking 
accounts both have positive bal-
ances and I contribute to a retire-
ment fund every month. 

My living situation got much 
better as well. 11le crazy roommate 
took a job in Northem California 
and eventually, after another more 
sane roommate, I rented my own 
apartment. 

Living by yourself is something 
I highly recommend. No room-
mates, no parents, no one but you. 
It is truly liberating. If the house is 
a mess, it's your mess. You can't 
blame your roommates. If the 
house is clean, it is because you 
cleaned it. If you need company, 
call someone or go visit a friend. If 
the last thing you want is to talk to 
someone, don't answer the phone. 

Boy was I wrong. My first year 
out of college was miserable! And I 
mean miserable. 

I was broke. San Diego is a lot 
more expensive than Davis. I had 
no idea by how much. My checking 
account had a balance of negative 
$100.00 at the end of every month 

In San Diego, I really had no 
idea how to meet anyone new. To 
make things worse, two of my ex-

.,. 

boyfriends and three of my college 
friends got married within a year 
of graduation. One of the ex~ 
boyfriends married the girl he 
started dating immediately after I 
broke up with him. I was starting 
to feel like everyone else was get-
ting married and I couldn't even 
find a date. 

Then, after that first year, my 
life progressively improved. Since 
then, I have received a promotion 
at work, more money, and I love 
the people I work with. Overall, 
working at the Guardian has been 
wonderful. People say I glow when 
I talk about about my job. As busi-

rr---~ LAST WORDS FROM GUARDIAN SENIORS JI.-........ 

N i lou Mostofi 

I 

, 

Wow! lt is finally here. It is 
finally my tum to send out the 
invitations, don the heavy robe 
and sit in the sticky heat with my 
fellow students - impatiently 
waiting for the diploma to be nes-
tled into the palm of my hand. 
June 12, graduation day, is around 
the corner, and there is only a 
weck left for final preparations, 
the last round of papers to be writ-
ten, the last exams to be taken. 

I· 
I I 

I have been in school for the 
past eighteen years of my life, the 
last five of which have been th.~ 
most grueling, exciting and infor-
mative. Now, along with many 
other graduating seniors. I will be 
embarking on a new journey, into 
the "real world." I will have to 
build on the knowledge and the 
experiences I have gained while 
' bcijns.~~ .' slu~t; I wilt have t.o,

! 

Megan Smith 
S60,4 I 3.50. 
That's how much my parents, 

my husb.and and I have spent on 
my education, room and boatd 
and entertainment for the last 
four years; $60,413.50 worth of 
checks mostly made out to the 
UC Regents. $60,413.50 is a lot 
of money ... what did I get for 
that price·' 

I guess the most obvious thing 
would be my degree. A bachelor 
of science in biology from the 
University of California, San 
Diego - sounds impressive, 
doesn't it? Hopefully it will be. 
ThaI picce of paper represents four 
years of midterms and papers and 
quizzes and finals. It represents 
hours spent battling professors 
who graded unfairly and hours 
spent with exceptional TAs who 
made sense of confusing lectures. 
That piece of paper owes me 

and professional environment 
while fine-tuning the skills I have 

• I 
picked up alon'lthe way. 

The path ahead is a windy one 
and the end is unclear, fQr me 
because I have yet to wholeheart-
edly choose a profession to 
which I want to dedicate the rest 
of my life. As of now, my main 
interest is in journalism and so I 
want to pursue a professional 
career in this field. I do not know 
if this is the final path. I want to 
be sure that I am making the ·right 
choices before I go through the 
motions and plan my future. 

I will have a chance to do this in 
the next three and a half months 
until the necessary requirements 
for graduating have been met in 
summer school. In many ways: I 
,m glad , will have this break to 
still enjoy the fruits of being a stu-
denl· while conte'inplating life on 

countless nights of less-than-ade-
quale amounts of sleep, hundreds 
of dollars worth of textbooks I did-
n't open, multiples of $16 lecture 
notes that saved my grades and 
dozens of folders and files to orga-
nize the papers I have accumulat-
ed over theSe past four years. 

Mostly il represents the facl 
that I managed to learn enough 
information eam the privlage of 
associating myself with the 
department of biology. My 
degree will be one of the best 
results of the $60,413.50, but the 
past four years were definitely 
made of more than just acade-
mics. 

Part of the $60,413.50 also 
bought me a few really great 
friends. My dad has always told 
me he has been paying people to 
be my friends for years ... this time 
I can almost believe him. That 

the beautiful beaches of La Jolla (if 
there is a miracle and La Jolla actu-
ally gets sun). It will be the last 
chance for me to learn in an under-
graduate classroom environment, 
and I am glad I have this opportu-
nity. While in summer school, I am 
planning to take on any internship 
or job opportunitie I can acquire 
to familiarile myself with the 
many faucets of journalism and to 
help me make a decision. 

After I finish summer school 
and take the GRE, J want to 
spend some time traveling 
around the United States and 
possibly Europe. But more 
importantly, I want to work and 
live in a new city where I am 
unfamiliar with street names and 
places. I have lived in San Diego 
since 1984, so I think it is about 
time to move on. 

Growing up in San Diego and 
going to two different universi-
ties (USD and UCSD) and a 
community college (Mesa), I feel 
ready to break out of the mold 
and start something new. 

ASII~ transfer student, UCSD 
was an eX,tremely intimidating 
school. The \evel of competitive-
ness, the fast-paced quarter system 
and the high expectations of the 
faculty were all things I was not 
used to, bllt had to become accus-
tomed to v,ery quickly. USD, being 
a small, private Catholic ~hQol, 
had a more personal, one-on-one 
attitude toward its students. That 
was the quality thai first attracted 
me to it straight out of high school. 
But once I went there for a year, I 
realized that a bigger, lp:1ore 
divers\) campus w~ . the atmos-

See NILOU, Page 88 

$60,413.50 put me in a position 
where I could meet so many dif-
ferent people. I am one of the few 
people I know who is actually still 
friends with everyone I lived with 
freshman year. Harlan Hall 400 
was the best suite! Some of my 
husband Mark's friends have also 

.become my good friends, as well 
as dozens of fellow students who 
attend University Lutheran 
Church. There are so many people 
I can (Oount on at UCSD. Thanks, 
Dad, for going all out to buy me so 
many high-<juality friends. 

I also spent some of the 
$60,413.50 on great activities. 
My friends and I once signed up 
for surfing lessons during winter 
quarter of my freshman year. We 
figured we might as well take the 
lessons when there was the least 
likely chance of having a full 
class. Who's going to take a surf-
ing class during the time of year 
when the O\jean water is the cold-
est? Me and my friends! Once a 
week we took the 34 bus down to 
La Jolla Shores to surf in water 
that was so cold that you knew it 

. was lime to get out when you 
could no longer bear the pain of 
your froslbilten apPendages and 
your head was starting to feel 
really heavy. We had the best 
limes out in the water! 

The $60,413.50 enabled me to 
do something I never would have 
thought of doing before - work-
ing here at the Guardian. There I 
was sophomore year, with no 
experience whatsoever with a 
newspaper, in charge of pulling 
out an entire section after two 
weeks of ·training. I had never

,...-------------1 LAST WORDS FROM GUARDIAN SENIO 

I Scott Yager. 
It's strange how something 

that was once so commonplace 
can become so unfamiliar in such 
a short time. 

During my tenure as Hiatus 
editor last year, I wrote two or 
three articles a week to till the 
space vacated by our flaky writ-
ers. It got to the point that I would 
sit down to write an hour or two 
before we started laying out the 
section, and I would have no 
problem cranking them out. I 
practically used to live at the 
Guardian office, and now it feels 
strange when I come back. 

This year, I've written exactly 
one article, and suddenly I'm 
finding that it '~ not as easy a~ it 
once used to be. 

Such is life, I suppose. The 
stuff you end up taking for grant-
ed always comes back to kick 
you in the ass later on. I've found 
that the college experience is 
more than gaining a lot of knowl-
edge about isomers and biosyn-
thetic pathways; It 's about learn-
ing how to live. After four years 
of toiling away at UCSD. the 
main thing I've learned is that· 
life is never easy, but that doesn't 
mean it can't be a damn good 
adventure. 

When I first came to UCSD, I 
was ecstatic at the thought of 
leaving high school. Sure, I had 
friends that I'd miss. but for the 
most part I didn't really enjoy 
high school. 

College seemed' like such a 
drastically different setting: hang-
iDg out in the dorms, not having to 
go to class if you didn't want to. 
eating in the cafeterias. I had it all 
planned out - I would major in 
animal physiology Ind neuro-

science, and I'd made up my mind 
to go to med school. pretty much 
like everybody else in Revelle. I 
figured that a few years of hard 
work would payoff when I 
became a doctor. 

My, how things have changed. 
After two years of barely scrap-
ing by in science classes that I 
couldn't stand and either slept 
through or skipped outright. my 
pathetic GPA and increasing dis-
like for my classes made me think 
that maybe science wasn 't the 
way to go. Eventually. I decided 

~ , I' "' I 
I (Q ~ / DON'T FOHn To KEEP ~ YOUR BOD COYERED wnH 

IlIsw.n£~ SUMMER SICKNESS . 

to change my major to communi-
cation, a fairly drastic move con-
sidering I had never taken a 
comm class. 

'One of the main catalysts for 
this change was working at the 
Guardian. I started working there 
because of the free CDs and 
movies - not to mention the fact 
that you get paid. You really 
can't find a sweeter deal than 
that. After a year of writing, I 
was offered the opportunity to be 
co-editor of the sectlon last year. 
Pretty good for a guy with no 
newspaper experience other than 
a handful of articles the year 
before. Since I had decided that I 
wanted to go into journalism. this 
seemed to be the perfect way to 
go about it. 

That year as editor taught me 
more about life than anything else 
illocollege. At the time, I was also 
worklOg at CAPE, so I haLi to jug-
gle the Guardia", CAPE, a full 
load of classes and a meager 
social life. Even though the year 
was pretty much non-stop stress, I 
thrived on it. 

My life moved in such a radi-
cally <1tfferent direction than I 
had planned. Instead of wasting 
away in structural biochemistry 
and maybe working in a lab or 
volunteering at a hospital, I held 
managerial positions in two 
dynamic environments where I 
leamed how ' to interact and co-
exist with people, rather than 
learning simply how they 
worked.

The thing is, no matter how 
much you think your life is 
planned out, things will change. 
While you may find security in 
having a predetermined direction, 
I feel that it's just better to 
approach life willing to make 
decisions as they come along. 

People are always asking me 
what I'm going to do after I grad-
uate. Four years ago, I would have 
said I was going to medical 
school. Two years ago. I would 
have said I was going to write for 
a newspaper. 

Now. I have no idea what I'm 
going to do. There are so many 
things that I haven't experienced 
yet, so how can I make that choice 
already? I'd rather be 21 years old 
and trying to find my way to what 
I really want to do with my life 
than be stuck in a career from day 
one. . 

My father is an architect. 
When I was in high school, he 
moved to Hong Kong when his 
firm opened an office there and he 
had an opportunity tl? become a 
partner. As long as I can remem-
ber, his life has been architecture. 

When we went on vacation, he 
used to take us by famous build-
ings that he wanted to see and he 
would tell us all about who built 
them, why they used certain styles 
and features and how architecture 
is art . 

At the time, J thought it was 
incredibly boring. Now that I'm 
older, I realize that architecture is 
his passion, and there's nothing in 

the world he would rather do. 
When he moved to Hong 

Kong, he was following his dream 
of becoming an elite architect and 
having his visions realized in all 
comers of the globe, even though 
it meant leaving his family behind 
for a while. 

At the end of my sophomore 
year at UCSD, my parents told me 
they were separating. "It 's too 
hard to be apart for so long, and 
we just want different things," 
they said. For a while; I thought 
my parents were just being self-
ish . I thought my father was 
putting his career over his family, 
and that my mother was selfish 
for not wanting to try li ving in a 
strange place for the sake of keep-
ing the family together. 

Now I think I know better. I 
understand that they had their 
lives planned out too, and things 
changed. My parents got married 
in college, and my mother pretty 
much followed my father around 
for years while he built his career. 
Finally,' she just couldn't follow 
him any longer, and he couldn't 
let her hold him back. A couple of 
years ago, he left Hong Kong and 
moved to Washington, D.C., but 
he tells me he still wants to go 
back overseas, possibly to 
Europe. . 

My parents are trying to work 
things out again, but who knows 
what will happen. Maybe it's for 
the best, but J don 't want that to 
be my life in 15 years. I don ' t

B8 SUMMER & GRADUATION SPECIAL 

JAKE: 
Defered enrollment 
to U. of Penn 
Continued from ..... 83 
they wanted me to be in Philadel-
phia on Aug. 22. Then the panic 
set in. 

I wasn' t ready to leave yet. My 
parents didn 't want me to take a 
year off but everyone I met, 
lawyers and non-lawyers, told me 
it was the best plan. Horror sto-
ri es of law students dropping out 
from exhaustion and burnout took 
their toll on my psyche. I quickly 
took evasive action: deferment. 
And Lord have mercy, Penn 
accepted my plea. 

My parents cited my "momen-
tum" from college as a reason to 
enter law school right away. Let's 
see, I' m a third-quarter senior 
wi th two classes, which I nevel 
allend, spending most of my time 
pl ay ing intramural sports and 
dri nking. What momentum? I'm 
not ready to buckle down yet. 
Even if I never am ready, it sure 
doesn' t hurt me to start a little bit 

later. If I can take not making 70 
grand a year for just a little bit 
longe r, I can keep having the time 
of my life. After living off a 
Gllardian editors salary for a 
year, I'm sure it 's not going to be 
a problem. 

So now I'm living off my par-
ents for a little bit longer. Of 
course, I'm not exactly living off 
them. I need to get a job, my own 
health insurance and auto insur-
ance, and a place to live, but I 
don 't have to bury my nose in the 
law books just' yet. I'm a death-
row inmate who has been given a 
reprieve. I have a free year to do 
anything I want with a spot wait-
ing for me at a prestigious school. 

Don't ask me whatI'm going 
to do: I'm going to try to write 
some more stuff somewhere or 
something like that. I want to go 
to Nepal or somewhere else. I 
want to stay in San Diego. Who 
knows? The greatest thing about 
it is that I have absolutely no idea 
what I'm going to do and I love 
the hell out of that. 

I'll start my career later. Life is 
short - make fun of it. 

The UCSD Guardian 

NILOU: 
Will happily post-
pone grad school 

fer to Mesa Community College and 
I stayed there for a year. The next 
move was to transfer to UCSD, 
where I have completed my degree 
in history. Looking back, I am con-
tent with the decisions I have made 
and the routes I have chosen. It has ' 
taken a long time, but it has been 
worth it. The education I have 
received. especially at UCSD, has 
prepared me for the next step. 

I will ultimately go back to 
school for a graduate program in 
journalism, but I am happily will-
ing to postpone that phase for a 
year or so. I envy those seniors who 
know exactly what they want to do 
upon graduating. I, for one, need 
time to think things through. 

Whatever the case may be, I 
want to congratulate all of the grad-
uating seniors and wish them the 
best of luck for the future. 

scon: 
Contemplating 
move to New York 
C ........ ' ........ 7 
have that kind of passion for any-
thing at the moment, so I need to 
keep searching until I find it. 

As for me, I'm finished with 
finals on Monday, effectively 
ending my career here. I don' t 
know what I'll do next. I know 
that I want to experience new 
places and things, so I'm plan-
ning to give New York City a try 
- I want to live in a big city 
where I don't have to drive a car 
or fight campus parking, and I 
can just walk around and feel the 
vitality of urban life. I've moved 
around quite a bit in my life. but I 
need to do it on my own. 

If there's anything I've 
learned from my father, it's that I 
need to experience life when it 
won't get in the way of anything 
else, like a family. If I'm moving 
to the city. now is the time. I 
don't know what I want to do, 
and I'll miss my friends that are 

Thursday, June 3, 1999 

still in school and living in San 
Diego. Maybe I'll stick around 
for a little while before I head 
elsewhere. 

It's scary not having a plan, 
but that's the beauty of it. Sooner 
or later we have to leave this del-
icate utopia where our parents 
pay the bills and our biggest con-
cern is making an 8 Lm. class and 
venture out into the real world. It 
scares the hell out of me, but it's a 
good kind of scary. It's a feeling 
of anticipation, not terror. 

It seems that I've rambled on 
farther than I expected. See how 
things change? Anyway, the 
moral of the story is: Don't be 
afraid 10 live your life. Your plans 
will most likely change, so be 
prepared. Or. don't - sometimes 
it's better that way anyway. 

In closing, I'd lilte to thank the 
GUlmiian IIICI staff members past 
and present for making the expe-
rience great, and all my friends 
who have allowed me to share 
their lives for the past four years. 
To all my fellow graduates and 
those to come, see ya in the real 
world.

ANN: 
Still doesn't know 
what the future holds 
ConlIn .... ".. ..... at 
tered lifestyle, but it doesn't hurt 
anyone else. It's great. Until I am 
so in love with someone that I am 
willing to share everything in my 
Iife, I'm on my own and I love it. 

These days my social life no 
longer needs a jump start. 
Although more structured and 
expensive, my partying days are 
far from over. The past two week-
ends i partied like a rock star or 
least like someone intoxicated 

enough to believe they were 
famous. I am also blessed with a 
great group of friends. On any 
given Friday night my friends will 
quietly listen to me when I'm wor-
ried about the future and will also 
put up with me when the last thing 
I need is another drink. In addi-
tion, although the quantity of dates 
I have will never compare to col-
lege, the quality of dates I have is 
so much beller. I won't lie to you, 
it i ~ more difficult to meet new 
people after college, but is possi-
ble if you try. 

I was asked to contribute to this 
issue because like the graduating 
seniors also. featured in this paper, 

this is the last Guan/ian I will 
work on. I have been admitting to 
UC Davis Graduate School of 
Management. That right, I am 
going back to bad weather and 
more studying than I can imagine. 

In lune of 2001 I will have my 
Masters in Business Administra-
tion with an emphasis in finance 
and nonprofit management. Hope-
fully, I will also have a new career 
in non-profit and government effi-
ciency consulting. However, I am 
now open to the concept that I 
really don't know what the future 
holds. I am ready for the possibili-
ty that two years from now, I 
might not want that dream any-

more. 
So, if you're about to graduate, 

accept that you don't have the 
world figured out. Be thankful you 
don't know everything. Life would 
be prelly boring if you did. Also, 
as cliche as it sounds, life is what 
happens when you ' re making 
other plans. 

You will be relieved to know 
my neurotic old roommate is now 
an elementary schoolteacher, get-
ting married in August, and 000-
bies name has been changed to 
Katie. Be open to change because ' 
it will happen whether you like it 
or no\. Congratulations class of 
1999. 

MEGAN: 
Freshmen friends 
are priceless 
Continued from pilg. 85 
done anything li ke this before, yet a 
friend gave me an opportunity, I 
took it and I found a college job that 
I rea lly loved. It isn't the specific 
type of job I want to make a career 
out of, but working at the Guardian 
taught me skill I never would have 
learned had I ke pt my freshman joll 
at the bookstore. 

I have learned how to apply for 
(and hopefully get) a job thanks to 
Ann - the greatest business manag-
er in the ent ire world. I have slowly 
learned how to beller manage people 
and get jobs done. I have learned 
how to type, I have improved my 
grammar and vocabulary and I have 
had the opportunity to become more 
politically aware. 

I think the best th ing about the 
Guardian is all the fun times I had 
hanging out with the people that 
worked here. The nut-sack jokes, 
dcaling wi th the crazy SpoIlS guys 
who wrote art icles while drunk, 
being so unbel ievably late you dri ve 
to the pri nter watching the sun ri se, 
being apprehended by elementary 
kids who steal all the candy at the 
Glwrdian survey table, having cheap 
beer and lobster on the Guardian 
retreat to Mexico and managing -
with all that - to put a paper out 
twice a week for the entire school 
year. How great is this job? 

I spent my $60,4 13.50 on an 
impressive degree, a great group of 
fri end , fun water sports, an oppor-
tunity to work in a great place and 
' ro much more. Was it worth the 

bem~.,? Absolutely. These have en s~f h be f

Oh, by the way, yOU · 've

Thank YO Il to my wonderflli.

file these past four years. You guys 
are the greatest. Mom - one less 
Ihing to stress about, I'm graduat-
ing! (That 's "D" for Done!) 
Thanks for keeping me in line and 
teaching me how to keep a house 
clean (who would have ever 
thought 1 would have thanked you 
for teaching me how to vacuum ?) 
Dad - Everyone always tells me 1 
have the greatest dad in the world, 
and they are right. Thank you for 
reminding me how important my 
education is. Just promise me that 
you won 't shave your beard for 
graduation! Linds - You have 
been a wonderful friend and sister, 
I'm sorry lance smashed you 
behind your bedroom door and 
broke the hinges. (Insert "Go

Thank you also to all the rest of

$60,413.50: Grammy for sending 
me weekly postcards, Grandma

Irwin Jacobs seems like a bit

Muir Freshman 

I don 't know who Irwin 
Jacobs is, actually. I'd like to 
see Wilt Chamberlain speak 
because he's a man of many 
talents and he's got a lot of 
accomplishments. He's a role 
model. He 's a model

Premise: Ibn, an erni ~sary of Ihe 
greal Persian empire, Iraveb north 
10 Russia and is kidnapped by a 
band of Vikings, led by Buliwyf, on 
his way 10 fighl gruesome monSlers 
known as the Wendol. Ibn, though 
nOI a warrior, must learn to harness 
his strength to overcome the mon-
sters Ihat stand in his way. 

Players: Directors Michael 
Crichton and John McTiernan 
direcl Antonio Banderas as Ibn and 
a supporting cast of relatively 
unknown actors. 

Prospects: Wasn't this movie 
supposed to come out in the 
spring? And now they're talking 
about pushing it back to fall? fin-
ish the damn movie, and release it 
already. Audiences aren't going to 
get anymore motivaled to see the 
film version of Crichton's take on 
"Beowulf." 
August 27 
..... ~·.WIfe 

Premise: An astronaut immedi-
ately reti.res after a mysterious mis-
sion to space leaves him changed, 
sending his wife into a spiraling 
chain of chilling events. 

Players: Johnny Depp plays 
Spencer Armacost, the disturbed 
astronaut, while Charlize Theron 
plays his wife. 

Prospects: The implications that 
this film unravels into a full-blown 
alien invasion flick sort of ruins the 
interesting chemistry that could 
evolve between Depp and Theron, 

but it 's definitely wonh seeing the 
film to find out. 
September 10 
ChIIlFIICtor 

PremIse: If a new biological 
chemical weapon is exposed to 
temperalures over 50 degrees 
Fahrenheil , bad things happen. 
Two men try to make sure that 
doesn't happen, and that II doesn't 
gel stolen by a terrorist. 

Players: Cuba Gooding Jr. and 
Skeet Ulrich star in this film by 
newcoming director Hugh John-
son. 

Prospects: Biological chemical 
weapon can't exceed 50 degrees, 
eh? Kind of sounds like a bus full 
of people that can't go below 50 
miles per hour. Thinking "Speed" 
in a refrigerator? Now you're get-
ting it. 
September 17 
Fer Love fill ... __ 

Premise: During a once-in-a-
lifetime perfect game at Yankee 
Stadium, an aging baseball pitcher 
for the Detroit Tigers goes through 
a series of flashbacks in which he 
reflects on the course his life has 
taken. 

Players: Kevin Costner stars as 
the main character Billy Chapel in 
this film directed by Sam Raimi 
("Army of Darkness" and ''The 

Quic~ and the Dead"). 
Prospects: Costner probably 

should be put on some kind of pro-
bation to prevent him from making 
any more horrible films. However, 
if this movie has an ounce of "Bull 
Durham" or "Field of Dreams" in 
it, there's hope. 
Town .... CoIndrJ 

Premise: In this mid-life-crisis, 
romantic comedy, an architect goes 
out on the road in search of other 

Ttlursday, June 3, 1999 

women, but he finds that there's 
really only one love in his life, his 
wife. 

Players: Warren Beatty and 
Dianne Kealon play the husband 
and wife, while Andie MacDowell, 
Goldie Hawn, Jenna Elfman, Garry 
Shandling, Charlton Heston and 
Nastassja Kinski comprise the sup-
porting cast. 

Prospects: This tilm's all-star 
line up will ultimately be the dri-
ving force behind its success or 
failure. 
A stir of Eciloea 

Premise: A man discovers he 
has ESP, and this new-found ability 
leads him lo investigate a murder 
and struggle wjth his own sanity. 

Players: David Koepp (''The 
Lost World" and "Mission Impossi~ 
ble") writes and directs this film 
staring Kevin Bacon. 

ProIpects: Bacon is due for a 
bit" psychological thriller, and 
while this film probably won't be 
the one that puts him back on the 
map, it should be good nonetheless. 
September 24 
.... _u.. 

Premise: In Nazi-occupied 
Poland during World War II, a poor, 
Jewish cafe owner accidentally 
overhears a forbidden radio news 
bullet.in signaling Soviet military 
successes against German forces. 
To combat the overwhelming 
depression and suicide that per-

v~s the ghetto, the man tells fic-
titious news bulletins about Allied 
advances against the Nazis.

814 HIATUS The UCSD Guardian Summer Movie Preview Thursdai', June 3, 1999 HIATUS BI5 

From wild comedy flicks like "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" to exciting action and drama films such as '7be General's Daughter, " this season's line up of blockbuster movies is sure to pack a punch. 
Jale4 
IIIIIIII 

• 

Pre ... I .. : 
While study-
ing the 
behaviors of 
mountain 
gorillas in the 
jungles of 
Rwanda , 
anthropolo-
gist Ethan 
Powell went 

missing for two years. When he was discovered, he 
had taken on the characteristics of the animals he 
had lived with, including a kill-or-be-killed mental-
ity. Now. locked away in a prison for the criminally 
insane, Powell is forced to speak with psychiatrist 
Theo Caulder who tries to unravel what events 
caused the transformation. 
Playen: Both Academy Award winnetS'; Cuba 
Gooding Jr. stars as the' straight-laced Caulder while 
Anthony Hopkins stars as tlw enigmatic Powell. 
Unfortunately, director Jon "runeltaub doesn't have 
~Ory. 

opkins appears to be returning to 
his "Silence of the Lambs" roots with Gooding fill-
ing Jodie Fost.er 's role. All things considered; this 
film probably will not hold its own in the 
doctor/patient genre. 

.--

Pre ... I .. : 
In this sequel 
to the suc-
cessful 1997 
comedy 
"Austin Pow-
ers: Interna-
tional Man of 
Mystery," the 
criminal 
mastermind 

Dr. Evil travels back in time to the '60s with the 
nefarious intention of stealing Austin Powers' mojo 
and inadvertently leaves him shagless. Austin must 
thwart Dr. Evil's plans once again by following him 
back in time, recovering his mojo and saving the 
world from destruction. 
PI.y .... : Comic genius Mike Myers takes on 
four roles in this film, while the supporting cast is 
composed of Heather Graham, Robert Wagner, Gia 
Carides, Seth Green and Kristen Johnston. 
Prospects: Myers is a sure thing when it 
comes to guaranteeing a successful comedy film. If 
the movie 's only half as good as the scenes in the 
trailer, "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged 
Me" is one summer movie to look forward to. 

June 11 
,_. Illarllls 

Pre ... I .. : A military investigator finds that the 
rape and murder of an Army captain - whose 
father is a well-known and well-respected base 
commander and general - leads to a complex and 
dangerous underworld of sex and cover-ups at the 
West Point base. 

.-..,.,.: "Con Air" director Simon West directs 
a star-studded cast including John Travolta" 
Madeleine Stowe, James Cromwell and James 
Woods. 

~ It's possible that this thriller could 
go the way of Nicholas Cage's "8MM" and be more 
disgusting than intriguing. On the other hand, T~. 
volta's presence may be what the film .10 
make it interesting. 

Pre.I .. : 
When a lost 
child is 
found by a 
family of 
apes in the 
heart of 
Africa, the 
apes raise 
him as theif 
own. As the 

lost boy grows, his differences set him apart from 
the animals and he becomes lord of the jungle. One 
day, however, the young Tarzan observes newcom-
ers to the jungle who look like him but dress in 
strange clothing. Their presence generates conflicts 
for both Tanan and his jungle family. 
Players: This animated feature has a number of 
talented actors providing voices for the characters 

. including Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver, Glenn 
Close, Wayne Knight and Rosie O'Donnell. 
Pro.pecta: It doesn't make sense -that Disney 
chose to recreate the Tarzan legend right after two 
other Tanan-style films ("George of the Jungle" in 
1997 and ''Tarzan and the Lost City" in 1998) stum-
bled poorly through theaters. Disney ought to look 
for more original and fresh themes. 

~1.21

"... .. : Sonny Koufax 
is more commilled to being 
a kid than he is to having a 
family. However, when his 
girlfriend dumps him, 
Koufax adopts a child to 
show her he can be respon-
sible. Fatherhcod winds 
being a lot more than he 
expects. 
PI.yer.:"Happy 
Gilmore" director Dennis 
Duean again teams up with 
comic actor Adam Sandler, 
Also appearing in the film 

are Cole and Dylan Sprouse, Jon Stewan and Joey 
Lauren Adams. 
Prospects: Sandler's had a great run of films 
recently and 'has shown solid earnings at the box 
office. This film will simply be more of what we've 
come to expect from the star of ''The Wedding 
Singer." 

.. II 
II. '-It: 
IIIIII'. 11111 

PreIIII8e: After tilt boys from South Park watch 
and bcaj.n to imitate the new Terrance and Philip 
movie, their parents overreact; eventually going so 
far as to declare war on Canada (where the Terrance 
and Philip movie was made). The children of South 
Park protest the parenIS' decisions, and of course, 
Kenny dies. 
PIIIy...: Creators Trey Parker and Mall Stone 
star with Mike Judge, Eric Idle, Isaac Hayes, Min-
nie Driver and George Clooney. 

~ By this point most of the "South 
Park" fans are burnt out on the series. So what bet-
ter time to cash in on the untapped film market by 
porting the once-shocking series to the big screen? 

" ..... : Evil southern confederate inventor Dr. 
Arliss Loveless plans to restart the Civil War by 
assassinating President Ulysses Grant. Only two 
men can stop him - gunfighter James West lind - ~ 
master of disguise and inventor Artemus Gordon. 
On a dangerous train journey from Washington to 
Utah, West and Gordon must combine their skill~ 10 ., 
defeat Loveless and his dilbolical machines. 
PIIIY--= Barry Sonnenfeld. di~or o[ ~M:_ 'III.·illiI"'!"~ 
Black" and "Get Shorty." directs Will S 
Kline, Kenneth Branagh and sal ..... 
........... It's a weird idea, all doubhbout it. 
But it's an letion film set in the ReconstructionNlC-
torian era with enough neat-o inventions to qualify 
as a pseudo sci-fi. Actors Smith, Kline and Branagh 
u:e excellently cast in their roles. 

......... : 
"Summer of 
Sam" refers 
to the year 
1977 in 
which . the 
serial killer 
known as 
"Son of 
Sam" (who 
later turned 

out to be named David Berkowitz) continued his 
killing spree. Berkowitz eventually killed six peo-
ple and injured seven in New York City. In this 
retelling, a group of young men in the Bronx allack 
a man they believe to be the "Son of Sam." . 
Play...: Noted filmmaker Spike Lee has wrillen 
and directed this film, which stars John Leguizamo, 
Michael Badalucco, Mira Sorvino and Anthony 
LaPaglia. 
........... this is very different film for direc-
tor Lee, and it will be interesting to see what he 
chooses to do with the topic of serial killers. 

...J I! ~., 
, 

Pr .. I .. : 
Four high 
school boys 
make a pact 
to lose their 
virginity 
before gradu-
ation in this 
teenage sex 
comedy , 
Each of the 

boys attempts a clumsy scheme to score with the 
opposite sex and inevitably wind up losing their· 
dignity. The girls. who are also anxious, are just as 
awkward, trying to act cool while romanticizing 
and idealizing what is basically just pure physical 
attraction. 
.-..,.,.: Jason Biggs leads a talented cast of 
actors including Shannon Elizabeth. Alyson Hanni-
gan. Chris Klein, Nat¥ha LyonAC. Thomas Ian 
Nicholas. Chris Owen IIId Tara Reid. Pr.-..DIc The R--ratcd trailer for tbis film was 
the funniest thing audiences have seen since 
"There's Something About Mary" last year. 

, ~J J I (I 

PrenIIM: Kermit's a frog. 
Fozzie's a hear. Piggy's well 
... a pig. So what the hell is 
Gonzo? This question, which 
has plagued the fans of Jim 
Henson's Muppets for 
decades, will finally be 
revealed this summer when 
the latest Muppet movie 
explores the depths of space in 
search of Gonzo's people. 
.-..,.,.: A number of stars 
join the Muppets including: 

David Arquette, Hulk Hogan, Ray Liotta, Andie 
MacDowell and Gates McFadden. 
Pra ... ~ctc None of the Muppet films since 
Henson's passing have been up to the standards of 
the original movies. However, the premise of this 
film gives it the potential to surpass the originals 
and bring the Muppets back into style. 

~1IJ11 
1111 II_I BII 

PremIse: A psychologist and his wife find them-
selves drawn into extramarital affairs and experi-
menting with new forms of sexuality. This leads the 
couple on a dizzying psychological voyage into 
their own identities and their relationship. 
Players: The late Stanley Kubrick directed hus-
band and wife acting couple Tom Cruise and Nicole 
Kidman as well as Sydney Pollack and Jennifer 
Jason Leigh. 
Pro.pecta: Kubrick brought such films as 
"2001 ," "A Clockwork Orange," ''The Shining" and 
"Dr. Strange love" to the screen. Simply considering 
his previous work is reason enough to be intrigued 
with what Kubrick will deliver this time.

Pre ... I .. : 
Desperate 
movie pro-
ducer Bobby 
Bowfinger 
will do any-
thing to get 
his dream 
movie made. 
Since he's 
nearly bank-

rupt, he enlists a group of misfits to make the film 
and an eager but nerdy guy with no acting experi-
ence to be his star. 
.... ,.,.: Steve Martin wrote the film and stars as 
Bowfinger in dtiI film directed by franl '"Oz. Eddie

........ : In this remake of the 1963 classic ''The 
Haunting," four people assemble in an allegedly 
haunted house to investigate and document the ghosts 
that are said to reside there. As the night progresses, 
one of the party finds her psyche unraveling under the 
strain of strange voices. Before long the group is at 
odds with each other, and surviving the night no 
longer seems like a certainty. 
Players: Recently departed Jedi Master Liam 
Neeson plays the lead character Dr. Jeffrey Marrow 
while Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Owen 
Wilson also star. , 

~ It's nice to see a scary movie come 
along without the seemly requisite blood-and-guts 
sequences. Hopefully the film will be able to terri-
fy audiences with purely cinematic devices, rather 
than gallons and gallons of blood. 

Pre ... I .. : 
Go go Gad-
get-movie! 
Tl)is remake 

--ofJhe ~atur­
day morning 
cartoon show 
"Inspector 
Gadget " 
once again 
pits the 

clumsy yet noble Inspector Gadget against the evil 
Dr. Claw. This time. Dr. Claw has constructed, a 
Gadget of his own, an evil Gadget. Though Inspec-
tor Gadget may have gizmos up the whazoo, he 
may not be able to defea! this devilish duo. 

Players: Matthew Broderick plays Gadget while 
Rupert Everett plays Claw. Also appearing are 
Andy Dick, Dabney Coleman and Cheri Oteri . 

Prospects: Definitely a film for the kids rather 
than those of us who grew up with the series. Nev-
enheless, this film looks to h .ve a successful tran-
sition from the animated teleVision show to the live-
action silver screen. 

~IIJ II 
D Ilr -·1,1 

PremI-= One year after three film students disap-
peared in the BIalik Hills Forest, while making a doc-
umentary about the legendary Blair Witch, their 
equipment is discovered. On the tapes and cameras 
are the sounds and images of what became of the 
three young filmmakers. The audio and video record-
ings of their exPeriences are pieced together into what 
comes to be known as ''The Blair WItCh Project." _~ 
Players: The cast of this fi 1m is made up of com-
plete unknowns. Heather Donahue, Michael 
Williams, Joshua Leonard, Bob Griffith, Jim King. 
Sandra S,"chez, Ed Swanson and Patricia Decou. 
Pro.pects: Rarely does a horror film come 
along that can give someone the creeps just by read-
ing the press release. Mark your calendars for this 
one kids. It's going to be a bumpy ride. 

Pre ... I .. : 
When the 
villain Cas-
sanova 
Frankenstein 
escapes from 
a mental 
institute and 
begins re-
assembling 
his crew of 

baddies, an unlikely batch of superheroes joins 
forces to stop him. The Mystery Men include Mr. 
Furious, who can get really, really mad; The Shov-
eller, who has a shovel he uses to smack bad guys; 
and The Bowler who knocks people down like pins. 
Players: A fantastically diverse cast comprises 
the "Mystery Men" including, Geoffrey Rush, Ben 
Stiller (Furious), William H. Macy (Shoveller), 
Janeane Garofalo (Bowler), Greg Kinnear, Hank 
Azaria, Claire Forlani and Paul Reubens. 
Pro.pecta: Another film that audiences should 
take note of merely for its star power. There is an 
impressive reservoir of talent coursing though this 
film, and it will be interesting to see how these per-
formers interact with one another. 

PremlM: Two young men start a secret club that 
gives young urban professionals the chance to beat 
the living crap OUI of each other. The popularity of 
this club grows exponentially, and eventually some 
very profound rules are created to govern it. Since one 
of those rules is that no more than 50 people may join 
a single fight club, new fight clubs pop up every-
where. Everything goes great until mutual interest in 
the same woman comes between the two men. 
PI.yer.: Helena Bonham Carter plays the 
woman who comes between the two main charac-
ters played by Brad Piu and Edward Norton. 
ProIpec.tI: This films' energizing trailer makes 
one reconsider the highly negative implications of 
Pill'S involvement. There really is no way Pill can 
ever redeem himself after those three hours of mind-
numbing crap called "Meet Joe Black," but he can try.
