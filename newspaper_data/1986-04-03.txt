Imagining and enacting the futute 
It is a);ain the hour for the undergraduates to voice the moral and practical 

direction intended for this university. When electing our officials and 
disseminating our views through referenda, we must thoughtfully consider our 
vision of the future. We must produce a concerned conceptual response to the 
current political structure , and must enact our most inspired choices. Next 
Tuesday and Wednesday ' you will vote on 12 referenda. Each one touches on 
an issue important to the social future of this campus. 

Referendum question #1 queries a proposed tram/ shuttle system on campus. 
The tram, which' would be • a part of a larger project to place parking lots on 
the edges of campus, wouid provide transportation for students to and from 
their vehicles. The tram system would coincide with the long range expansion 
of the university. Nonetheless, we feel that until the university adequately 
addresses the problems of accessible centralized parking for students, such 
extravagant projects must not take priority. Therefore, we urge you to vote "No" 
on question # 1. 

Referendum question #2 asks students if th ey support building an 
amphitheater on campus. This project would improve student access to more 
concerts and lectures and will draw the greater San Diego community on 
campus. UCSD would become a real resource to San Diego, and , in tum, would 
receive greater city support. We urge you to vote "Yes" on question #2. 

Referendum question #3 queries students about UC divestment from South 
Africa. UCSD students have strongly supported it in the p ast , and we hope that 
you will continu.e the call forUC divestm~nt fro~. comranies doin~ business 
in South Afnca In order to dtsable the ractst poliCIes 0 ItS apartheid 
government. 

Referendum question #4 is closely associated to #3. It asks if you support 
active AS action to acheive divestiture. We thought that active AS involvement 
would have ensued from your vote to support divestment, but it seems that the 
AS is acknowledging that it forgets to act on the wishes of its constituents. 
Because the AS needs to be constantly reminded of its responSibility to support 
and act on the wishes of the student body, we urge you to vote "Yes" on 
question 4 . 

In response to question #5 , "Do you supporr turning the existing Student 
Center building into a Student Cooperative Center upon completion of the 
new University Center?" we urge a "Yes" vote . The present site of the student 
center is readily accessible and should remain available for student use. We 
would much rather see the building used for student cooperatives that would 
best benefit students by being unified in a common building. And that may be 
denied space in the new University Center. 

Referendum question #6 asks your opinion on forming a board of directors 
for the Cooperative Student Center that would be elected by the coops. We 

urge you to vote "No." Facilities funded by the Associated S'tudents should be 
managed by the Associated Students. In the interest of fair management and 
representation , a committee sh ould be formed made up of representatives of 
the college councils, the cooperatives, and the AS. Council proper. 

Referendum question #7 involves a prop osed fee raise of $2 per qua rter to 
fund new student cooperative projects. W e recommend a "No" vote o n th is 
cooperative expansion. U ntil the cooperat ives organize themselves more 
effectively and avoid the budgeting problems that they have exp erie nced in the 
past, additional student fundin g should n o t be allo tted. We would also like to 
see the coops recruit more students into their organ izations before th ey begin 
exp andi ng into larger a nd more complex services and organizations. 

Referendum question #8 asks whether or not you support e nding funding of 
recruitment by the militaty, Secret Service, CIA, FBI and INS. T h is question was 
voted down in the election last year, wh ich brings up an interesting po int. 
Theoretically, there should n 't be any recruitment to end th is year. In any case, 
we think th at the mil itary policies oppose the ideals of free d emocracy stressed 
in this unive rsity and authorize di scrimina tion in m any form s. We u rge you to 
vote "No" on this q uestion . 

We urge your sup port on all th ree questions (8-10) ad vocating funding for 
athletic progra ms o n campus. By supporting athle tic shcolarsh ips, Division I 
status, improved funding for intramural and intercollegiate athle tics we will 
open an opportunty to improve school sp irit and student pa rtic ipation in 
athletics. In expanding, however, we must not allow our in tramural program to 
lose support. 

Referend um q uestion # 12 asks you r op in ion about fundin g of the Alternat ive 
Media. Although the two surveys at the beginning are interesting, we d o not 
feel they are means to determine funding of the alternative med ia . Alte rnative 
university publications should be a way we d isseminate d ive rse and opposi ng 
viewpoints and not JUSt Widely supp orted p ublication s. 

The third section of refere ndum questio n #12 asks you to d ecid e how much 
money the alte rnative media sh ould receive from your student fees. W e think 
the current alte rnative med ia budget of $47,000 annuaUy is adequate e nough to 
provide diverse voices. Th erefore, we urge you to vote to maintain the current 
fundi ng level of $1.50 per student per year. 

Finally, the Al ternative Media referendum addressed the question of the 
media budget. We support the financial ceiling on th e alterna tive media. 
Whatever money the media requires above the ceiling the individual papers 
should earn through advertiSing revenues, fu ndraisers and sub SCrip tions. We 
urge you to vote for the ceiling of $4,000 per year ( the cost of 72 pp. per year). 

Above all, we encourage you to be involved in determining what direction 
this campus takes. PLEASE VOTE!

Resisting fundamentalism 
Editor: 

Mr. Guessoum accuses me of 
sharing the "incredible 
misconceptions many people 
have about Islam," 
misconceptions which he claims 
many Americans have gamed 
through the mass media. 
However, my views about Muslim 
socieoes come nO! from the mass 
media bur from my experiences 
traveling in Muslim nations m 
the Middle-East and orth 
Africa. To my disbelief Guessoum 
denies the oppression of women 
in Muslim societies. ThiS IS an 
incredible assertion and one 
which I challenge him to defend . 
The gross and mtolerable 
oppression of women I spoke of 
in my article is real - I've seen 
it with my own eyes and It is 
revoltinl1. Anvbodv. includmp 
the Afghan Communists, who 
seek to change it has my 
sympathies. 

Guessoum's casualty ligure of 
1.5 million IS wildly wrong. The 
U.S. News and World Report ( 
February 28, 1985) gives what is 
generally conSidered to be the 
most reliable casualty figure-
100,000 to 200 ,000 rebel and 
civilian dead . ThiS does not 
include the thousands of leftists 
murdered by the Afghan rebels, 
nor the thousands of Afghan 
army soldiers who have given 
their hves fighting the Musl im 
fundamentalist rebels . Guessoum 
challenges my assertion that 
SoVlet Muslims ~ njoy hl' highest 

standard of living in the Middle-
East, however U.N. statistics back 
up my assertion . According to 
the 1984 Global Almanac, the per 
capita income in Muslim Soviet 
Central Asia is $3,327 per year. 
This figure far exceeds the rest 
of the Middle-East , where the 
per capita income is usually 
under S 1,000 per year. This of 
course excludes the sparsely 
populated, Oll-nch nations of 
Oman, Kuwait , Saudi Arabia , and 
Libya . 

Guessoum's charges of Soviet 
use of chemical weapons m 
Afghanistan is dead wrong. 
Indeed , much to the 
embarassment of the Reagan 
administration , the purported 
"yellow rain" (chemical weapons) 
has been Widely and conclUSively 
proven to be excrement! Most 
major U.S. newspapers have 
qUietly pri nted retractions and 
the charge is thoroughly 
destroyed in the Atlantic 
Monthly. 

Mr. Woodward brings up the 
pOint that in the capital city of 
Kabul some women are allowed 
to go to school and to work at 
normal jobs. My point was that 
the rebellion, which occurred 
enmely in the countryside , was 
sparked by the commUnist 
regime's attempts to extend these 
and Other rights to the 
countrysldc, and to complete 
them in Kabul. Perhaps thiS was 
not made clear m my 
commentary. In addition , while 
wearing the oppre 'sive and 
unhealthy veIl may or ma y nO! 
be a "custom obse rved by a 

minority" in the capital, it is 
mandatory in the countryside 
and it epitomizes the non-
person , slave-like status of 
women. 

The writer seems to feel that I 
am glorifying the Soviet 
intervention in Afghanistan. To 
the contrary, I simply feel that 
the Soviet backed leftist regime IS 
preferable to a Muslim 
fundamentalist resistance 
government.

Clearing the air 
Editor: 

This letter concems the letter 
to the editor run on Mar. 31 
entttied "AnOther 'good Jew ... · 

Although I agree With an 
appreciable amount of the 
aforementioned letter - having 
some reservations, however. with 
certain passages - [here are rwo 
points I'd like to clanfy. 

First , I do nOt represent the 
opmion of the "Black Student 
Union (BSU)," as the letter 
indicated. My involvement with 
the leiter was as an individual. 
After bemg presented with the 
letter I was under the Impression 
that I had made this POInt 
understood . 

Second , my agreement with 
the letter is to the extent that 
Greg McicCrone can be perceived 
as bemg presumptuous - in 
addition to arrogant - If he

False flattery 
Editor: 

An open letter to the Genera l 
Foods Corporation 

We are writing to express our 
disgust at your ad for 
International Coffees which lists 
"8 ways to get a man to ask you 
out again ." You suggest: 

1. When he mentions "The 
Bears ." know they're from 
Chicago. 
2. eem unimpressed when 
he lells you he scored a hat 
trick in the third period . 
3 . Take his word for it when 
he teUs you that 1984 was a 
very good yea r for 
Chardonnays . 
4. Laugh at his jokes, even 
when he forgets the punch 
lines. 
5. Avoid , at a ll osts, letti ng 
hi m see you reapply your 
lipstick. 
6. Order s methIng morc 
exotic than a white wine 
spntzer. 
7. omphment him on hiS 
taste In colors, even If he 
.lrrIVe InJcansandaT-shm 
8. lell him you'd ask him LIp 
for a SUIS c Mo ha , hut you 
only do th<lt on second 
dares 

This ad tells women to be coy 
and falsely flattering. It assumes 
women are ignorant about sports, 
and tells them they need to put 
on a show to be attractive to 
men. (Surely, there are worse 
faux pas than being "caught" re-
applying lipstick. And what if 
one happens to line idiots in 
order to "catch ? man." The 
intended "humor" is no excuse 
- insulting ads like this just 
aren' t funny. 

The basic message here is 
deceit, and on those grounds we 
can reject it, for either sex. (The 
ImplIcit assumption about men IS 
that they are stllpid enough to 
fall [or an act like this .) Further, 
women have been given rhe 
message for roo long that 
"feminine wiles" will ger us what 
we wam, and that we need to 
hide who we really arc . We are 
especia lly disappOinted that you 
ran suc h an ad in a university 
newspaper, presuming that 
"gem ng a man to ask you our 
again" would be a hot topic for 
college women. 

At UC D we have found a 
great "trick" for getting a second 
date - we ask the guy out 
again . And in the future, when 
we have a date up for coffee .. . 
we')] be serving Hills Brothers'.

Wintery policies: Reagan 's 
ill-fated efforts to aid Contras 
By PETER QUERelA 

Like clockwork , rhe harbingers 
of spring are beginning to make 
their annual appearances. 
Extended periods of 
precipitation are giving way to 
sunnier skies and balmier 
temperatures. A myriad 
assortment of wildflowers are 
blooming in the normaUy arid 
and seemingly lifeless deserts of 
southem California. The majestic 
winged eagle is venturing farther 
from her comfortable nest in 
search of food for her offspring 
bom during the harsh winter 
months past . A melancholic-like 
spirit of optimism and good 
feeling is rejuvenating all living 
organisms, ranging from the 
s implest species of insect to the 
most inteDigent mammal - man. 
And of course, as in previous 
springs, President Reagan is once 
again renewing his seasonal 
demand for millions of taxpayer 
dollars to. purchase military 
weaponry for the Contra 
guerrillas in Ce ntral America, rhe 
former Samozan soldiers 
obsessed with overthrOWing the 
people-supported andinisra 
government now runnning 

I aragua. 
All these are bur a few of the 

signs heralding the arrival of 
another spring. It wa~ only last 
March that Mr. Reagan 
persuaded Congress ro provide 
$27 million in "humanitarian" 

aid for the Contra murderers , 
who the president so fondly 
refers to as America's "freedom 
fighters." Not satisfied with that, 
the Reagan Administration now 
is insisting on boosting laSt 
year's allocation four-fold to $100 
million, 70 percent of it for 
military hardware and the 
remaining JO percent for 
economic assistance. 

In his "Let's-hear- it-for-
Grenada-one-more-time" speech 
February 20, the preSident 
declared, "Today, in Nicaragua , 
we are seeing a chain of events 
similar to what happened here 
(in Greneda). A coalition of 
religious leaders rangi ng frOl\1 
Jewish rabbis, and PrOtestant 
minis ters ro Catholic bishops, on 
March 4, charged the Reagan 
Administration with e)'ecting "a 
scaffold of deception around 
Nicaragua ." The 200- member 
movement concluded, "In the 
name of God, stop the lies, stop 
the killing." 

In an attempt to exert 
unbearable pressure on bOth 
Houses to approve his pet 
project by Easter Sunday. Reagan 
launched a hard sell campaign 
over rhe nation's airwaves on 
February 25 - a repeal 
performance is scheduled for 
mid-March In which Reagan IS 
tossi ng into one basket all the 
recent events that have 

transpired in the Philippines, 
Haiti , Grenada and now 
Nicaragua. HIS premlsc is that 
hiS administration is responsible 
for skillfully manipulating affairs 
behind the scenes - so-called 
"quiet diplomacy" - among 
these countries. when in fact, it 
has bee'n the people hving in 
these same nations who have 
really been controlling their own 
destinies , while the United 
Sta tes, for the most pa rt has sat 
c heering from the bleachers. It is 
obvious that there are no clear 
parallels between the Philippines, 
Haiti, Grenada and Nh:aragua. 

Now that the first three 
regimes have collapsed from 
within, "the great communicator" 
hopes to capitalize from these 
events by convi ncing Congress 
and those uninformed 
Americans , wh o are not up to 
par on current issues, that we 
must intervene, first convertl)' 
through moneta!)' aid , or If that 
fails ro matenalize or proves 
Insufficient, then overtly. That is, 
shipping in American boys to 
fight and die. 

A com prehensive study 
conducted lasr year by the Rand 
Research CorporatIon proJe ted 
that a u.s. rnllitaty intervention 
would require a minimum of 
100,000 American troops. It 
predicted U.S. casualties alone 
quickly totaling 15,000. Speake r

nightmarish rerun of Viemam. 

President Reagan , instead of 
channeling his great power and 
influence in an ill-fated project 
to "Save the Contras: would do 
well to direct his energies toward 
dlrecring a more meaningful and 
useful campaign , say, saving the

alleged "request lor Soviet 
milttary intervention" should be 
clarified. What actually 
happened is this : In 1978 
President Mohammed Daud was 
killed and replaced by Taraki of 
the PDPA. His vice president , 
Hafizullah Amin , killed him and 
took over. The oviets had Amin 
executed and replaced by Afghan 
Babrak Karmal, who, at the time , 
was living in Moscow. Only after 
the Soviets had established their 
puppet government did the 
request for intervention occur. 

It is stated in Sacks' article 
that the freedom fighters stalled 
their revolt as a result of the 
granting of rights to women by 
the new regime. However, the 
nomads (Kuchis) of Afghanistan 
care little for· politics. They had 
no propelly for their wives to 
inherit and had little use for 
schooling. The reason they are 
fighting is because they resent 
the intrusion of their homeland 
by a foreign power. 

There arc also several untruths 
in Sacks' allicle. I am not saying 
that he has deliberately lied , 
merely that he is perhaps 
misinfonned . It is an absolute 
falsehood to state that women 
were forbidden education and 
the right to hold public office. 
My father, who worked in the 
American Embassy in Kabul 
during 1974-78 dealt on a daily 
basis with the Chief of Protocol 
of the Afghan foreign ministry -
an Afghan woman. My marher 
was friends with the manager of 
Kabul's American Express and 
Air France offices - an Afghan 
woman graduate of USC. While I 
rode the bus to the American 
International School of Kabul I 
saw little girls in their blue 
uniforms walking to school. Also 
Afghan women were not forced 
to wear oppressive veils which 
incidentally did not hamper 
breathing as there were holes for 
the mouth and eyes. It was 
merely a custom that a minonly 
of muslim women observed . 
None of the Kuchis ever wore 
veils as they were not muslims. 

Also, while the severe rebel 
tactics are described in detail , no 
information is presented 
regard i ng the Soviets use of 
napalm on Villages and the 
burning of the farmer's crops. 
While the upposed rights be1l1g 
gramed to women by th e Soviet 
backed regime are presented 111 
great detail, not one bit of the 
article is dedicated to the rights 
of some Afghan children who, at 
the age of seven, are 
pennanentl>' se parated from their 
famili es and taken to the Soviet 
Union for political 
indocrnnl zanon. 

aeks' comments ignore the 
fact thaI Afghanistan is belllg 
occupied by a ~ reign power. No 
extension of women 's rights or 
1,1Ild reforms justifies this action . 
The freedom fighters are secklllg 
to rid their so il of foreign 
prese nce. All arguments don't 
erase the fact that Afghanistan is 
occupied.

the new Ul1l versity Center upon 
its complenon sometime in '87. 
Referendum #6: 

Do you support th e jomlatioll of 
a democratic boord for the 
management oj the Student 
Cooperative Center facilities elected 
by the student organiza tion s located 
In the center l 

Currenrly. the Enterprise Sub-
Committee governs the student 
cooperatives on campus. This 
referendum calls for the 
expansion of the Sub-Committee 
to increase its powers to control 
the coops that are housed in the 
Student Center. The proposed 
democratic board will bc a Sub-
Committee of the University 
Center Board . 
Referendum #7: 

Do you sl~pport the illcrease of 
the current Universily Center fee by 
$2.00 per student, per quarter, 
loched in for the establi hment of a 
co-op adviSOry office and staff, and 
t!1 facilitate the development of a 
co-op bank, a fann co-op, and 
enlarged recycling center, a sports 
co-op, and other co-op start up 
services? Thl locked in fee would 
be managed by the Student Center 
Board Cooperative and Enterprises 
Sub-Committee. 

The Student Center activity fee 
as of fall '85 was $12.50 per 
student. The proposed budget for 
the University Center has called 
for a $25.00 increase per student 
for fall of '86. This referendum 
proposes that the $37.50 activity 
fee for next fall be increased by 
$2 to guarantee student co-op 
funding. 

Referendum #8: 
Do you support elldlllg the direct 

or illdireu use of student 
Registration and Actlvlly Fees for 
the purpose of on-campus 
recrui(ment by the military, the 
CIA, the Secret Service, the FBI alld 
INS? 

The use of activity fees to 
recruit stud ents for these 
government organizations may 
bc viewed as a positive step 
taken by the University to create 
opportunities for college 
graduatcs to start in relatively 
high paying pOSitions. On the 
other hand , these institutions 
have been accused of Violating 
human rights and displaying 
prejud ice against homosexual 
applicants. 
Referendum #9: 

Do you support a larger 
percelltage of your current student 
Registration Fees to be used for 
increased financlQl support for the 
intercollegiate athletics program at 
UCSD? 

This institution (UCSD) has 
prided itself with being one of 
the most academically oriented 
universities in the nanon . A 
larger Intercollegiate athletic 
program could facilitate the 
issuing of athletic scholarships, 
consequently decreasing the high 
level of scholarship at UCSD. 

Conversely, along with the 
increasing enrollment, the_ 
athletic program must also grow 
to meet the needs of a 
diversified campus. Fulltime 
coaches and updated equipment 
and facilities will provide the 
opportunity for students to ex ell 
in college athletics. 
Referendum #10: 

Do you support a larger 
perce ntage oJ your current student 

Rcgi\tration Fees 10 be used Jor 
increased support for th e intramural 
athletiCS program at UCSD? 

The intramural athletics 
program at UCSD is th e largest 
in thc country. The continuing 
suppOrt of reglstration fees will 
cventually lead to the need for 
increased fundmg to proVide 
olTi cials and equipment for th c 
influx of new studcnts annuallr 

On the other hand , if the 
Intercollegiate budget is 
increased to fund a DiviSIOn I 
team, there will no longer be a 
need for new equipment for 
intramurals, but both 
intercollegiate and intramurals 
can share the facilities. 
Referendum # 11: 

Should the IntercolleglQtc athletic 
program move from NCAA DivislOIl 
III, In which there are no athletic 
scholarships or recruitment , to 
DIvision I in which a finanCial 
commitmenr by students 10 provide 
athletic scholarships, increased full -
time coaching, recrllllment of 
athlete and expanStoll of faciliCles 
1V0uid be necessary? 

The move of the athleti cs 
program from CM Division 1II 
to Division 1 would require the 
hiring of fulltime coaches and 
building of modernized facilities. 
This referendum would involve 
the increase of student 
registration fees to support both 
the larger athletic facilities and 
possible athletic scholarships. 
Referendum # 12: 

Last year, 11 % of your studelll 
actiVlIy fees ($ J.50 per student, per 
quarter) was allocated co the 
Alternative Print Media (Altemative 
Visions, Brie/cage ReVIew, The 
California Review, L 'Chayim, The 
Koala , the new Indicator, The 
Peo ple 's Voice, Sappho Spealls, and 

Voz Frontenza). ThiS referendum IS 
designed to detemune what student s 
jed about this use of th eir aCllvily 
Jees. The results of th is referendum 
are adviSOry to neX( year's A.S. . 
Co unci l. 
A. Which of the follOWing media do 
you read? (Vote for as many as you 
wish)' 
- Alternative Visions 
- Birdcage Review 
- The California Review 
- The Koala

you want to fund? (Vote fOY as 
many as you wish ): 
- Alternative VISIons 
- Birdcage Rf\~ew 
- The California Re\iew 
- The Koo la 
- L'Cha}1m 
- the new indicator 
- The People 's VOice 
- Sappho Spealls 
- Voz Fronteriza 
C. At which level do you support 
funding? (Vote fo y one) 
- 52.00 per studenr, per quarter 
(a 50 cent Increase of current level) 
- 51.50 per st udent, per quarter 
(the cumnt level) 
- $1 .00 per student, per quarter 
(a 50 cent decrease of current level) 
- $0 per student, per quarter (I 
do not support funding with my 
activity fees). 
D. Whic h method of funding do 
you support? (Vote for One) 
- Funds are to be distributed to 
eac h media reflecting need and 
desire as detenl1lned by the Media 
Board. (The Media Board is the 
sta nding committee. consisting of 
students, which draws up all media

related budgets, etc.) 
- Funding oj all alternative media 
up (0 a level of $4,000.00 
(reflecting the costs of 6 Issues per 
year). Prospective new media shall 
be junded up to a level of 
$2,500.00 Jor the first year. 
- Start up money of $2,500.00 to 
be allocated by the ASUCSD for one 
pilot Issue and 2 subsequent issues. 
Additional funding is to be reCflved 
through alternative sources. 

A and B of the Alterna tive 
Media Fundi ng Referendum are 
essentially readership surveys to 
detennine the popularity of each 
publication and students' feelings 
concerning the allotment of their 
fees to pay for alternative media. 

Pall C of the referendum 
speciflcaUy asks whether the 
current level of suppOrt for 
alternative media should be 
increased or decreased . 

Pan 0 of the referendum will 
act as an advisory statistic for 
the A.5. to refer to when 
deciding what method of 
funding to support. 

The first method for funding 
is the current procedure that 
entails the division of the budget 
to be done in accordance with 
need and frequency of 
publication. 

Michael Fahlbusch's proposal 
corresponds with the second 
method of fundi ng that calls for 
a ceiling of $4,000 to be gramed 
to each publication. 

The final proposal provides 
seed money, very similar to 
Berkeley'S method of funding, to 
provide enough monetary 
support to publish two issues 
and then the publication is left 
to find alternate forms of income 
through advertisements and 
fundraisers. ~

Sit back, relax, enjoy the ride 
By ALICIA AGOS, ruff WnCt' , 

V ACATIO I G CAN be hard work. Our road tnp orth started out easily 
enough. We packed up the 
family auto , rather, we 
intenningled luggage and 
assorted car trash. We StO ked 
enough Diet Coke to last us till 
Bakersfield. We made sure the 
family dog (Lucy, as 10 I Love) 
had seen enough bushes to last 
HER till Bakersfield . We alerted 
friends , warned parents, buckled 
ourselves 10 - we were off. 

Fun is not one of the exits on 
Interstate 5. To these eyes, 1-5 is 
synonomous with hell . The lush , 
irngated roadSides of Los 
Angeles give way to the rolling 
hillsides of Valencia which in an 
ugly !Urn give way to de olation. 
More than once I wished for a 
27 foot Wmnebago. eqUIpped 
with a fully stocked kitchen , 
bathroom, teleVISion , VCR, couch 
and master bedroom And. more 
than once. I woke up from my 
delUSion of grandeur with the 
sounds of the 1m Ie bump-bump-
bump-humps that orne from 
one of the SIXty zilhon lane 
changes 

Actually. things weren 't all Ihal 
bad on this particular [TIP The 
ride UP is alwa ys the better,

most comfonable spot on the 
evcr-uncomfonable VinYl. 

The SIX and a half 
hours from ValenclJ to the bay 
area are painful ones. The 
highlight of the evening was. far 
and away, our StOp at the 
Infamous Casa de Fruta. There 
are about ten "Casa de" Stores, 
restaurants, parks, fruit stand , 
playground, wme and hcese 
tasting rooms . thiS place had it

that stuff, though . Because can 
swears by this place (and 
because at 11 pm everythmg el e 

\\'as closed) we headed straighl 
for some hfe~sa\mg pie and 
coffee. I had a piece of apple pIe

nonconfonnist had a rom beer

we were forced to amu e 
ourselves wi th an IOgemous

Searching for the Write Stuff 
By ROBERT LEONE, SWjf Wnla 

I HAD A PROBLEM. I wasn 't taking nmes fast enough, legibly enough or easily 
enough. My mechanical pencils 
were fouling their leads. wooden 
pencils had to be sharpened 
TWice a lecture, and both types 
snapped points often. Cheap 
ballpoints would leak smeary ink 

all over my backpack and the 
ink IS srill smeary bours after 
writing. Expensive ballpoints use 
the same ink, and the new 
rolling writers are tOO expensIve 
for the amount of ink they've gOl 
in their guts. Felt tips go flat. 
Aside from the problems with 
the tools I use for writing, I have 
problems wi th the way I write . 
It's illegible. Sometimes I can't 
read it hours after I write it. My 
scyle is a degenerate mix of the 
Palmer method you learn in first 
grade and the printi ng you learn 
in kinderganen. II's really bad. 

Something had to change. It 

was euher me or the concept of 
note-taklllg. I had to change my 
writing style, and I had to 
change my \Hiting tools, and I 

had to do research on both. I 
started with writing styles. 

The Palmer method of cursive 
handwriting appears to be a 
Simplified descendant of the 
copperplate seriptS loved by 
Victorian clerks and despised by 

'anyone with taste. You learned 
the Palmer method in the lower 
grades, and you forget it as 
qUickly as possible. 

In my senior high school class, 
I knew of only one person who 

still wrote cursive capital Qs. 
Fonunately , there are 

alternatives. An example is the 
italic hand, bare of aU but the 
most necessary of loops and 
TWists, a descendant of the 
humanist hands developed by 
such men as Erasmus. It 's elegant 
and legible. I had a passing 
famlhartty with that son of 
writing, so I decided to adopt 
this panicular mode. 

ow I had to get a pen. Dip 
and goose-quill pens were Out, 
sin e open bottles of'ink would 
cause nasty messes in crowded 
lectures Every other type of pen 
was not SUI ted for Itahc writing, 
and the special "Calligraphy" felt 
tip had the usual felt tip 
problem 

I was left no choi e. I had to 
get a fountain pen . Yes, a 
fountalll pen; those messy 
arc haic things your grandparents 
used . Yet the fountain pen has 
been u!>Cd as an Important 
creative tool by such literary 
giants as Mark Twain t1nd Anne 
Frank. 

In fact, Frank's diary entry for 
the 11 th of ovembcr, 1943 is 
entirely about [he accidental 
inCineration of her five year-old 
treasure , and stated that she 
liked it so much in pan because 
of the thickness of the writing 
end . "\ can only really write 
neatly with a thick nib ." The

destination , happy that we 
wouldn't have to repeat this 
voyage for eIght full days. 

Ha-ha, the Joke was on us 
because boom! There we were 
agam , zooming down 1-5. iki 
had wisely taken a flight back 
down to San Diego. 

We finally got ourselves out of 
Palo Alto somewhere ncar the 
crack of noon . We made II all 
the way to Gilroy (one full hour 
out of town) before we topped 
in search of a new tape . After 
locating what seemed to be the 
onl . Gilroy record store we 
found that Gilroy didn 't have 
much in the way of easy 
listening. We did end up 
wandering into the Salvation 
Anny, still aware that we had a 
whole hell of a 10! to do and 
over 400 miles to do it m. 
Almost twO hours later we 
emerged with some of the 
chOicest finds. Black lambswool 
sweaters, green Boy Scout Troop 
Leader shi ns, pink beaued 
tops . .. it was thriftstore heaven . 

Back on the road and fifty 
years later we stopped for what 
proved to be an unsettling 
dinner. Lucy, who so far had 
prove n herself to be a very 
sturdy travell ing dog, has an 
undying passion for speannmt 
gum. Agai n we left her in the car 
but this time she was goi ng to 
do something about this neglect. 
In her search for anything edible 

or destructablc , she found a big 
pack of Wrigley's Doublemint 
foolishly left in iny purse . he ate 
the whole pack-fOIl 'and all . We 
found gum wrapers st rewn 
amidst a very innoce ntly faced 
dog. 

We got back in the car, and 
made it to Tujunga before we ran 
out of gas. We did n't just run out 
of gas, though, we ran out of gas 
in what we fou nd to be one of 
the worst neighborhoods around. 
We hightailed it to the 7-Eleven 
hopmg to fi nd gas pumps. What 
we found was some very 
uncooperative 7 -Eleven clerks, an 
even worse looki ng parking lot, 
and no gas. Things werc looking 
bad, Lucy was shaking from the 
tinfo il that raged withi n her 
stomach, no one would let us call 
the AAA. and I was trying to look 
unintimidated with a quivering 
dog at my feet. My faith in good 
samaritans was revived with the 
help of an ex-serviceman named 
Gaston who dTOve us aU to the 
nearest 76 stallon (five full miles 
m the black of night), waited till 
we got gas. drove us back to our 
strJnded car, then drove away 
resembling nothing shon of the 
Lone Ranger. 

After we filled the tank we 
stopped at a Wmchells to use 
the restroom and check out the 
midmght supply of donuts . 
Walking back to the car, I saw 
Lucy sitting contentedly in the 
from passenger seat. ean got in 
the car fi rst, and just as I was. 
reaching to 9pen my door, I 
heard this incredibly pained 
"AHHHHHHiI!!!! I JUSt Sat III dog 
vomit!" Evid~ndy Lucy could 
stand It no longer, sat in my seat 
and absolute ly heaved into Sean's 
bucket seat. I was trying to cover 
up my laughs, Lucy was pacing 
the daisy collection , and Sean 
had retreated behind a pickup to 
change his pants Lu y 
pro ceded to relieve herself with 
a jet stream of diarrhea. At this 
pOint the comedy of it all was 
overwhelming. We finally got 
Sean cleaned up, Lucy had 
purged herself of everything 
except her internal organs, and I 
went into Winchells to get an 
Old-Fashioned donut. We were 
on the road once more , this time 
until the lights of La Jolla shined 
blessedly on the horizon. ~ 

Alternatives to 
mainstream books

"How to read Donald Ouch ," by 

Anel Dorfman and Armand 
Mattclart ... . Who would have 
guessed that Disney characters 
were feeding us imperialist 
ideology? Rediscover Donald and 
his friends like you've never seen 
them before. You will understand 
why this book was banned in so

Unusual readtng? ThIS ktnd of 
reading is typical of the poli tical 
alternatives to mamstream 
America that Groundwork Books 
(GW) provides the UCSD 
communiry. In addition to books, 
GW also sponsors study groups, 
promoting soclahst 'ideals, and 
encourages students to Join their 
collective to learn about an 
"alternative economic system (the 

coope ra tive )." 
"We don't belteve there's 

something called complete 
objectivity ... we really have such 
a wide range of views," sa id 
Tamar Murachver, a one and a 
half year member of GW. "One 
of the basic tenets of 
Groundwork Books and our 
collective is that we believe in 
enticism ," she added . 

Groundworks is a kind of 
student cooperative, with a 
nonhierarchical struc ture of a 
collective, providing material to 
counter "th e mainstream bias on 
campus and in ociery." The 
store, run by student vo~nteers,

and perhaps the diary. is the -last 
sentence. "I have one 
consolation , although a slender 
one; my fountain pen has been 
cremated, just what I want later." 
Cremation was how the Gennans 
disposed of the bodies at the 
Bergen-Belsen camp where Frank 
died . 

I decided not to get one of the 
new disposable fountain pens, 
and I felt that a cartridge-filled 
would be economically stupid, 
because you get more ink for the 
buck than in those little 
packages of plastic cartridges. I 
also needed on with an italic 
nib . Since I wanted to spend less 
than six bucks, I went out to 

pric~ p~ns. 
The tirst pen I saw was a 

magnificent Mont Blanc, which 
retailed for $250. I found Cross 
pens at $80, Lamy pens at $40, 
and Parkers at $10 and $5.45. 
But they all had the wrong nib . 
All the pens with the right nibs 
were out of my price range; some 
of them were priced almost as 
far out as the Mont Blanc. The 
nib does all the work, and I 
wanted to get the right one. 
Then I went to the UCSD 
Bookstore, and found a decent 
pen, reservior-filled just like I 
wanted, offered in four different 
colors for $2.5 0. The catch? They 
didn't come with nibs, and the 
bookstore did n't stock any. They 
do now, but the selection isn't 
good . 

No one else locaJly had 
platinum nibs, others won't fit in 
the pens, so I had to ride my 
bike downtown to some huge an 
store on India street, and I 
snagged an ita lic extra fine nib 
for less than the price of the 
pen. 

After a couple of weeks , I felt I 
had Anne Frank's problem, so I 
pedaled downtown again and gOt 
an italic medium nib. I write 
reall y neatly now. 

It took blood (about thiS, I had 
a small argument with a moped 
rider), weal and tears, but when 
I used my customized pen on 
midtcnns, I knew I had what it 
takes. I knew I had the write 
muff ~ 

GW encourages students to 
partici pate in their collective and 
begin an initiation process, know 
as the "Long March." Although 
there are some paid posi tions at 
GW, most students volunteer to 
gain experience in the 
management and running of 
cooperatives, Mura chver 
explained. 

"We're not here to make 
money ... we're here to provide 
good reading material," 
Murachver said. Claiming that 
the Reagan administration is 
promoting a "red scare," 
Murachver says GW wants to 
counter this "disinfonnation" 
through education . 

"A basic tenet of Groundworks 
is to 'educate, agitate, and 
organize' ... we want people to 
confront contradictions (in 
mainstream propaganda) ... and 
work toward social change," 
Murachver said. 

GW study groups investigate 
different kinds of solutions to 
problems of exploitation , such as 
sexism and racism. Although 
most groups have a socialist 

inllue nce, group members are 
exposed to many diffe rent views. 

"There are many dilterent 
views (in study groups). That's 
what makes them fun and 

"A basic tenet of 
Groundworks is to 
'educate, agitate and 
organize.' " 

exciting, as opposed to being 
told 'this is what you should 
know:" Murachver said . 

One GW bookmark states its 
definition and goals: "We're a 
political collective working 
toward social change that allows 
people to take more control over 
their own lives. We're volunteer 
and anti-profit." 

"Our goals are never done ... I 
mean , yes, we're doing that , but 
yes, we want to do more ," 
Murachver commented. IZiJ

The ReganJ wil ho I 50 
s hools with the hest collegiate 
teams In the nation including 
th e Tritons who are entered in 
clcvcn evellls. 

"Teams from the east will be 
competing against teams from 
the west. This is very rare 
consldenng the co t," said men's 
varsiry coach Jon Lawson. 

Some of the top teams to 
watch out for at the Rega tta will 
be the Un iversity of Washi ngton , 
who have dominated the classlc 
for the past several years , and 
the Iv)' League se hools su h as 
Yale , Pnnceton and Cornell. 

Many of the teams from the 
East have a snobbish attitude 
toward West coa t rowing. "Many 
of th em (Ivy League schools) 
'Jo n't even se nd their 
,leavyweights anymore because 
they arc afraid of gClti ng beat by 
a West team ," said David Settles, 
a varsiry lighrweight rower. 

In addition to top rated teams 
from the East and Wesr, teams 
from other nations, some with 
olympiC rowers, wII! be racing. 
Among the Ii t of international 
representatives are Australia , 
West Gennany, Canada, ew 
Zealand and even a motley crew 
from Great Britian. 

The evelll is expected to draw 
a crowd of over 20,000. There 

arc more than 1500 athletes 
pamdpau ng. 

"Th,s IS as much a festival as 
it IS ,1 n athletic event," said 
novice coach Erik altmarsh. 
'Thc spectators wHl be able to 
sec me of the best compctition 
in th c world ." 

U SD spectato rs, according to 
coach Lawson "can expcct to see 
a 10[ of blue and gold at the end 
of the finish line . This is the 
strongest wc'v~, ever been goi ng 
mto the event. 

Raoul Werrz, a heavywclght 
varsity rower, expressed the 
same senti ments as hiS coach 
saying, "I think we ca n wm. ThiS 
is the highlight of the season . 
We've just fin ishcd going 
through Hell Week (spring break 
practi e) and we 're prepared 
well." 

The women are also expected 
to do well . "We're undefeated 
and we should be one of the top 
teams to beat." said Laurie 
Pollock. a star rower on the 
women's open division team. 

The Classi has the reputation 
of bemg a big party for all tho' 
involved. The races will be at 
East Mission Bay because Sail 
Bay is till polluted. Parking for 
the races is available at Crown 
Point. Pre li minary heats begin on 
Friday afternoon 3 to 5. The 
premier events will be on 
aturday between 6:30 am - 3 

pm. There will be spirit tents on 
the shore for the tcarns, fans and 
alumni. There will also be booths 
selling beer, t-shlrts hOldogs and

Women's tennis playoff 
picture getting cloudy 
By DAVID TEDROW, Slafj Wnur 

T HE PLAYOFF picture for the women's tennis team became a li ttle more 
cloudy Tuesday as the team lost 
to divison II Colorado College. 
Colorado is in the same region 
as UCSD, along with Pomona-
Pitzer, Occidental and Claremont 
among Others Only three se hools 
from this region will be chosen 
to go to Nationals , so the 
importance of this match is 
evident. UCSD beat Pomona 
earlier in the season, and the 
Tritons will play both Pomona 
and Occiden ta l at home later 
thi s month to help determine the 
National invitations. 

About the selec tion process, 
coach laPlante commented that, 
"Being defending champions we 
have a slight edge, but we sure 
need to prove ourselves this year. 
It's going to be close (agai nst Oxy 
and Pomona), but we're 
expecting to beat them." 

Although the TritO ns could

• 

only take one of the singles 
ma tches (Rnonda Meier won in 
Slraight sets) losing to Colorado 
6-3 , the loss should not worry 
them as much as it would seem 
due to the timing of the match. 
It came after a week of no . 
matches or practices over Spring 

"Being defending 
champions, we have 
a slight edge." 

- Tennis coach 
Liz La Plante 

missed in uncharac teristic 
break, and although their tans 
were fresh , the Triton's game was 
rusty. Colorado's girls were by no 
means overpowering but they 
consistently blooped the ball over 
the net, and when the Tritons 
went for the put away, they often 

fashion . 
Experience seem to be the 

key. Coach laPlante: "The girls 
are having good games, but 
they're not playing conSlStemly 
throughout the match . It 's mostly 
because they don't have the 

experience. Ho'1: much the team 
improves with me experience 
they develop dunng the 
remaining five weeks of the 
season will determine how well 
they do at Nationals. Maggie 
Merickel feels that, ·We have the 
talent to do weU, we need more 
motivation and confidence." 
Jessica Vernon added that on the 

Mond~y followi ng vacation , " We 
all made a pact together: that we 
are ~oin~ to work really hard the 
next five weeks - it's only five 
more weeks of matches, then 

ationals." 
Is five weeks enough time for 

the team to get to the level of 
play necessary to defend their 
title7 Stay tuned . ~

The Pub explores yet another avenue of entertainment with 
the start of the new Stand-up Comedy Show Series. Tuesday 
night at 9 sharp will be the time and the place for a few beers and 
now some added laughs as the five week series kicks-off with 
the talents of Rick Rockwell and Marc Price. Both comics 
dabble in TV Land, and both play characters named "Skippy." 
Price is known from "Family Ties" and Rockwell can be seen 
on "San Diego at Large. " Rockwell, the more seasoned stand-
up has been a top draw at The Comedy Store, the Sahara Hotel,

This is what lllakes us bad 
by john IChacht 

The stuff we sell is just 
the best 
Passing all consumer tests 
Days of heatlen -
Nights of sin 
Voodoo stick and shark 
fin 
When all around you 
seems like hell 
Just one sip will make 
you well 
Multipurpose in a jar 
If you ain't ill it'll fix 
your car 
In days of yore for all 
bad feelings 

Greg Roberts on drums and 
Dan Donovan on keyboards 
- proved that BAD may be 
melIow, but are no less 
socia lIy concerned. 

Following up their 
surprising successful first 
album with a short six-stop 
California tour (beginning in 
Pomona or "Potato" as Letts 
ca lled it) , the group treated 
San Diego to one of the stops 
on what Jones referred to as 
these "SAS style-raids, in a nd 
out, back home, divide up the 

loot ... " Short tours like the 
one to California enable Jones 
to not only "model his latest 
beachwear," but b reak In a 
new band that has one 
member who doesn't even 
play a musical instrument 
(Letts) . Jones is thriving in th e 
new format because "it's 
much more exciting .. . we can 
go on stage and the show will 
be a lot wilder and we're able 
to do the same shit that we do 
in the studio versions ... 
Better working with them 

than a bunch of boring old 
farts . " 

There's a new dance 
that's going around, 
When the hits start {lying 
you gotta get down 
All the young people 
dance round the square 
That old time groove is 
really nowhere 
Comparisons with his old 

band - the Clash - are not 
only inevitable, but often 
seem justified. With some 
important differences . 

" When I got booted out of the 
Clash, I landed on a dance 
floor ." This according to 
Jones, gives the band "an 
edge, that special something," 
that allows BAD to escape the 
punk music format that is 
apparently hampering his old 
band and get across the 
pertinent messages that 
characterize the band's lyrics 
to a new listening audience. 
" We don't want youth to go 
out and kill themselves," says 
Letts, "we want them to get 
up, be happy they're alive and 
do something that's impor-
tant." "The idea was to have 
dance rhythms, with rock and 
roll guitar over it, and songs 
that were supposed to be 
about something," adds 
Jones, "I like that moment of 
illumination, when they've 
been dancing to a record and 
they haven't checked out the 
lyrics yet, and when they're at 
home humming the tune and 
then they put two and two 
together, I like that. It's like 
hitting the major chord . W e 
came here to change things a 
bit. But to do it our way." 

Washing socks and 
stripping ceilings 
Nowadays its used 
medicinally 
Far all known human 
malady. 
Mick Jones and Big Audio 

Dynamite want to get you o ut 
on the dance floor and teach 
you a thing o r two. And one of 
those things is even dancing. 

Appearing last month at 
SDSU's Montezuma Hall , 
former co-founder of the 
Clash Mick Jones and 
company put on a rough but 
energetic show for a diverse 
crowd of 1500. And although 
those expecting to relive the 
glory years of the Clash were 
surely disappointed (BAD 
does no Clash covers, not 
even Jones' old tunes), Jones 
and his band - Don Letts on 
synthesizer and vocals, Lee 'E-
Zee kill ' Williams on bass,

Five months and one day 
ago, the San Diego Sym, 
phony, though in monetary 
distress, unveiled the new 
Symphony Hall in .what was 
formerly downtown's Fox 
Theatre. The evening was 
glittery ,md festive, and the 
symphony was able to reduce 
the rumors of its money 
problems for awhile. On Feb. 
27, however symphony 
officials went public . $2 
million was needed by March 
11 or the symphony would 
file for Chapter 11 
(reorganiza non) bankruptcy. 

No one knew whether the 
symphony would pull 
through. Already a grant of 
$500,000 was made, under 
the condi tion the $2 million 

goal was met. On March 8, 
after a two and one-half hour, 
unadvertised telethon on 
KUSI, TV which netted over 
$200,000 and a donation 
from the Roger Revelle 
fam ily, with several other 
large donations, musical 
director David Atherton 
announced before an almost 
full house at an all-Beethoven 
program, the symphony had 
met its goal and would be able 
to continue performing. 

"(The money) wasn't to 
erase a debt that incurred 
during 1984-85; it's to erase a 
carry-over deficit that's 
accrued over the past several 
years," explained Nancy 
Hafner, director of symphony 
public relations and newly

According to Hafner, the 

debt itself ran close to $1.8 
million, but the cost of 
maintaining the debt (with 
credit interest and other 
charges) was about $250,000 
annually . 

"We weren't dealing at all 
with the (current) budget at 
that point, but that we had a 
need to erase this ~arry,over 
deficit that was crippling us, II

Hafner and other members of

be in dire financiai straits 
seem to be all but forgetting 
about the fund raisers. In fact, 
says Hafner, the symphony 
has accumulated $681,000 
"extraordinary income." 
above the sum neded to 
complete payment of the 
debt. There also re main 
$100,000 in outsta nding 

pledges~ 
But since the symphony 

never counted on these 
monies when drafting a 
budget for the year, and the 
money collected will be 

SEWN ON 
LEllERS 

5O/SO COTION· 
POLYESTER 

FOR SlVlE AND 
COMroRT 

applied to the normal budget 
flow, creating in effect, more 
money than needed. 

"We will end up with a 
(technical) deficit in 1985-86, 
but the fact is we shouldn't 
owe anybody any money," 
explained Hafner. "The 
budget will reflect a deficit, 
but then we'll take this extra 
money (and be able to apply 
it ). 

"That's the huge area of 
confusion, I think: the public 
is alarmed that the symphony 
is going to end up with a 
deficit. " 

Now, however, it looks as if 
money problems may surface 
once more with the as yet un-
drafted 1986,87 budget, since 
there will be no "extra -
ordinary income" (at least 
none that is forseeable) next 
year. 

But there are still problems 
this year. Currently, the 
symphony is negotiating with 
musticians to cut four weeks 
from the contract with 
orchestra members. However, 
contrary to the accepted 
public and media belief, these 
four were not part of the 
original schedule, nor were 
they scheduled with concerts. 

"One week," said Hafner, 
"was scheduled vacation , and 
thr ee weeks were not 
scheduled with concerts. I 

think there tended to be a 
public perception that the 
symphony would be cutting 
weeks, but that was never the 
case. " 

New contract negotiations, 
which will help the symphony 
to determine the 1986-87 
budget, are, at this time, 
unscheduled. Right now, the 
symphony staff and personnel 
have taken a mandatory 10 
percent cut in budget to help 
alleviate the problems. 

All the news is not bad with 
the symphony. In fact, as 
Hafner points out, the news 
that has been of such concern 
to the local media does not 
point out that the symphony, 
despite rough times at first, is 
having a very good year as far 
as attendance (the Hall 

SPRING 1986 

became more crowded for 
performances following the 
announcement of the money 
problems than it had been 
since its opening). 

The Tijuana,San Diego 
cultural exchange, which has 
had two of its scheduled four 
performances at the Tijuana 
Cultural Centre, performed 
very well, with about 700 
seats (out of985 ) filled for the 
last performance. 

In addition , plans are 
underway for the construe, 
tion this summer of 
Symphony Towers: a $149 
million complex which will 
flank Symphony Hall by a 33-
story tower on the south and 
an 18-story hotel on the 
north . It is scheduled to open 

. in 1988.

BAD 
Conlinued from page 3 
quo for the Clash, and the 
progressive nature of BAD is 
already causing quite a stir. 
The band's video for 
"Medicine Show," a "fistfull 
of Miami Vice," according to 
Letts, has been banned by 
MTV and BAD is not pleased. 
Sort of. "We'd like it (the 
video) on MTV, but on the 
other hand, I don't see why we 
should give it to dtem. It's 
(MTV) just a lot of boring, 
biased, conservative non-
sense. It's insulting to our fans 
to have to sit through an hour 
and a half of that shit just 
to see our video. So if they' re 
going to ban us, shit, we' re 
going to ban them." 

"What we do on this video, 
which I don't think anyone 
else has done, is we behave as 
groups invariably do," says 
Jones, "which is like total 
assholes ... To Letts, MTV and 
top ten 'success' is not what 
the band has in mind anyway. 
"I don't think the American

MTV videos would indicate. I 
don't think they're all fighting 
over the latest Heart video. I 
don't believe it. I don't know 
if we want top ten in the U.S. 
charts, not at the cost of what I 
can see." The group plans to 
give "Medicine Show" to all 
the "smaller video channels 
we can find, so they can all 
have one over on those 
suckers at MTV."

For Jones himself, the 

turmoil he experience in the 
last turbulent years with the 
Clash have not lessened the 
idealism he holds for the 
power of music. The message 
remains much the same. O nly 
the package it's in has 
changed. "I realized music 
could have a positive effect 
when it had a positive effect 
on me a very long time ago. 
And now my perception of it 
is a very balanced one; it can 
have a positive effect as well as 
a nega ti ve effect ... 1 thi nk that 
each artist had his own 
responsibility to not be 
irres{?onsible with what they 
say. I do think that between us 
- the audience and the artists 
- they sho uld somehow 
boycott those albums that are 
irresponsible, that tell people 
to got out and get fucked up or 
abuse women. We think It's 
still (BAD music) still punk. 
We've got our bullocks, so 
we're still rock and roll." 

So never mind the bullocks, 
Big Audio Dynamite is going 
back into the studio in May to 
begin recording their second 
album, which according to 
Jones, wi l l be out in 
September. Meanwhile, BAD 
plans to continue to get their 
message across; Dance, but do 
SQ with feeling and purpo e. 
Mick Jones wouldn't have it 
anv other way.
