U C Officials 
Search For 
Cause of 
Applicant Decline 
MYSTERY: Minority application 
to CSU increase but UC official 
deny existence of a connection 
By Eric Brace 
Staff Wnter 

The University of alifomi a faces its second con-
~ec utive year of declil1lng numher~ of applications 
rrom underrepres nted minority groups. and uni ver-
si ty olTiclab want to know why, Director of 
Undergraduate Admissions aria Ferri sa i ~J. 

Although the total nUll1her ()fstude nt~ applying ror 
admi ssion rose 10.7 percent hetween 1995 and 1997, 
the numher of applications from African-American. 
American-Indian . Chicano and Latino student s dur-
ing that time dropped significantl y. 

"The numbers are more apparent and the deerease 
is more serious 1 for 1997-981." Ferri ~aid . "We want 
to know if we have the es tablishmcnt of it trend. or is 
it a two-year hiatus?" 

One possible reason for the decline is that Propo-
si tion 209 's passage less than a month before the UC 
application deadline. and the lega l challenges that 
followed, have steered many minority applicants away 
from the University of California. 

Another possible factor was the UC Board of 
Regents' SP- I resolution , which eliminates affirma-
tive-action criteria from admissions decisions start-
ing in spring 1998. 

However. Ferri said she douhted the controversies 
surrounding the two measure~ ~Ignllicantly affected 
UC app lication rates . 

"We don ' t W.lIlt to create a linkage 1 with the 
decrease in minorit y-group appli(;a tl on~ I." Perri ~aid .

According to U ~p() k e!'.rnan Terry olvll1 , there is 
no link hetween the hi gher U and lower U appli-
cat ion rate~ . 

" I don ' t think a cOl1lpari ~on hetween IUC and

Voluntary Graduation 
Standards Are Futile 

Last week, the UC Board o f Regents voted [0 endorse a 
ne w crop of hi g h-school g raduation standards that empha-
sizes what students learn versus how long they spend 
learning it. Considering that American college freshmen 
are consistently under-prepared for the ir classes, such 
stronger requirements cannot come a moment too soon . 

However, the proposed standards don ' t have any force 
behind them because their impkmentation is strictly vol -
untary - and as lop state education offic ial Delaine 
Eastin said, " It is loopy to have voluntary standards ." 

Local schoo l distric ts curre ntly set their own gradua-
tion standards, leading to wildly different requirements 
across the state. If tha t wasn't enoug h, the qual ity of edu-
cation varies dramatica ll y even within school dis tricts. 

For instance, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to recog-
ni ze that a 4.0 from the prestigious La Jolla Hig h School 
- the sole school in the San Diego City Schools district 
to ofler advunceu cla~~es like phy~iology - means more 
than a 4.0 from Lincoln Hi g h Schoo l. where stude llts in 
remedial algebra arc considcred ne rds or geek:....

Nothing more ridiculous has 
ever becn said concerning democra-

The best thing about our system 
is that one Illan can bring a city 
counci l's underhanded dealings to a

his supporters collected thousands 
of signatures from people who 
thought they ought to have some 

Some people took offensc when 
I pointcd out why San Di ego, 
"America's Finest City," is a sec-
ond-rate disaster. Basically, I 
showed that San Diego has all the 
hig-ci ty prohlems without the big-
city amenities. San Diego has the 
crime, the tramc and the pollution 
of a modern metropolis, but doesn't 
have a decent sewer system , reli-
ahle city roads or an airpon that 's 
worth a damn. Lindbergh Field, 
purportedly an "intemational" air-
port , is hardly world-class, Rather, 
it's San Diego class, also known as 
half-assed class, 

Where does one get 
the Idea that "a

Furthermore, what revenue has

letterhack could provide us with an

Why is San Diego huilding an

Most of the "revenue" the

the people usi ng it. At this poi nt, 
the city receives 10 percent of all

Alicc Cooper, Twisted Sistcr and 
Motley e rue\ lirst alhum,. There 
wa, sO I1l \!thing ahout lhose rciease, 
that made rod 'n' roll trashy, When 

li stening to those records, people felt 
a sudden urge to jump out of their 
cars and do karale kicks. Kids who 
lived hy these records were labcled 
"heathens," "heavy melalcrs" and 
"losers."

their mu,i (; rather than drug ahu\c. 

When asked whelher or not the

Ncil Hagen answered, "As we 
know rrolll the history of religion,

away from that, wc quit taking drug, 
altogether hccausc the last thing we 
want is a bun 'h of manipulaled 
LOmbies following u ~ around for 
whatever rcason." The hand has 
eomc to oclicve that hard work pays. 

Royal Trux has occn touring and 
recortling records for over a decadc. 
After meeling in Washington, D,C., 

ci l Hagert y and Jennifer Herrcma 
lx.:gun playing show, at CBGB's 
and recorded their first record in 
1988 for Royal Rct:ords. Thc alhulll 
was listoo in the Gavin Rcpon, and 
they hooked up with Drag City 
Records for their second. third and 
fourth records in 1989, 'I) I and '91 , 
respectively, 

Aftcr holding out and playing 
hard-to-get, the hand ,igned with 
Virgin Rct:Ord ... In 11)1)4. On Virgin. 
Royal Trux recorded and releas~d 

th~ir fifth alhulll, cnti tled Thank 
YOI( , in 1995 oincidcntally, it 
was recordcd with a producer who 
once workcd with Alice Cooper. 

Royal Trux latest album, entitled 
Wl'el SiXIl'l'I/, has already been 

acclaimed as onc of this year's best 
alhum, and is reminiscent of olher 
trashy-rock albums of the early 
'80s. At a first listen the albulll 
sounds like a rctro-'70s/'80s classic-
ro 'k r~l:Ord , but a closer listen will 
bring out the layers of guitar elrects 
and vocal tracks, The guitars t:arry 
more of a "wa-wa" funk sound than 
other records. 

The sccond song, entitled "Mor-
phic Resident," resembles early-era 
Rolling Stones. The band decided to 
make positive aspects of negative 
teenage energics the subjecl of the 
record. While the title Sweet Sixteen 
implies teen-age slruggles, the 
alhul11 was wrillen for all ages. Its 
divcrse assClnment of songs will 
have evcryonc , including grandmas

Bui" 10 Spill 
Perfect From Now On 

Warne' Bros. 

-.... -

Perfecl From Now On is a sur-
prising album from Built to Spill, 
repre~enting the band '~ progres-
sion. All the pressures and ex pecta-
tions associated with a major-label 
dehut exploded into an impres~ive 
rock-and-roll album . 

Built to Spill i~ drivcn by the cre-
ati ve impetu~ of ~ongwriter Doug 
Manseh, who is also responsible for 
the ethereal guitar and pixy-esque 

voca l ~ that give the hand such a 
unique ound. Mansch' abil ity to 
write brilliant. catchy pop songs fir~t 
hecame apparent early in his ca reer 
with Idaho's Treepeople, a hand that 
Kurt Cobain once claimed as a 
favorite. His abi lity grew and meta-
morphasi/ed with Built to Spill. 

The Innovati ve and energetic 
~o ng craft of their two major 
albums, Ultimate a/temlllive waves 

( 1 l)~3) and there 's Ilothing IVrollg 
with love (I ~94) , won Buill to Spill 
a loyal following and cri tical accla-
m<ltion . Martsch's lovc of car 
candy is also apparent with The 
Halo Benders, a two-a lbum side 
projcct he cre,l\ed wi th Ca lvin 
lohnson or Beat Happening/K 
Records fame. Warner Bros. must 
have been drooting at hi s alterna-
tive radio marketahll i t y. 

What Wamer Bro~. got Instcad 
wa~ an album or epic proponions. 
The trademark sound remains. hut 
the ~()ng~ have evolved a new 
~orhi s ll cation and ex panded inlo 
longer. Wider ranges of sonic 
amhlance. 

The \ong, aho have a mercur-
Ial. , 11Iftlllg quality. Full of parox-
Y""~ (II' \oca l and tnl/l~ltlOnal 
IIIctodlc,. thl'~ arc llIa,tcrfu ll y 
cralled and C\cCUlcd a, .In orga nic 

whole; never is there the feeling or 
the dislocation or overi ndulgence 
that oftcn plagued thc '70s progrcs-
~ive rock that seems to be the ulti-
mate precur~or to this album. 

On previous albums, the slower 
,ongs "I ways seemed 10 he ~ec­
ondary to the more up-tcmpo OIlC~ , 

~ reated wi th bs earc and performed 
wi th b~ pre<': lsion. This is no lunger 
true. On Perfeel From Now 011, the 
two arc given equal attention and are 
often hlended seamlcssly and erfon-
lessly within a song . 

Martsch procurcd the talents of 
COli Plouf', the dynamo drummcr 

of the Spinancs, and bass player 
Brell elson of Caustic Resin to 
provide the tight rhythm ~ec tion 
necessary for hi s journey into the 
ultra-mundane. Other instrumenta-
tion i ncillde~ cello and the increas-
ingly popular Moog and Mellotron. 

nder the orchestration of Martsch 
and producer Phil Ek, all these cle-
ments blend to create a deeply 
~onorous and multi -layered sound. 

High points include the rolling 
rhythms of "( Would Hun a Fly," 
the halcyon tones of "Velvet Wa1t7" 
and the coll age of melodies on 
"Made-Up Dreams." This album IS 
practically fl awless. When on the 
first track of the album, "Randy 
Described Eternity," Martsch si ngs, 
"I am going to be perrect rrom now 
on," I alll inclined to believe it.

Concordia Eagles Fly Past UCSD 
MISCUES: Committing eight errors in the opening game of a doubleheader at Concordia, the 
Tritons were swept by the Eagles, dropping their record to 5-3 on the 1997 campaign 
By Sean Rahlml 
Sports Editor 

In sports lingo. they say a lead is never big 
enough. You are never safe from a comeback 
and if you ask me. Concordia players arc 

ex perts at comebacks 
Consequentl y. the fat lady 

in the ~ t a nds ye~ t e rday at 
Concordia Uni ve rsi ty wa, n' t 
si ngi n' hecause the Eagles -

h o~ t s to our Tritons - came 
back fro m a 4-0 defic it in the 
I)QUom of the ~event h inn ing 
to defeat U SD 5-4 in the 

opener of a doubleheader. The Eag les won 
the nig htcap a~ well , pos ting a 6-2 victo ry 
that ended in the fi fth inning due 10 dark-
nes,.

get angry. 0 I stood up and began t; heering 
loudl y for our tea m. While th is was a foreign 
concept to the vast majorit y of the UCS D 
supporters, it sure wasn' t to the Hawk fans. 
So what did do they do? They cheered louder. 

OK, rtow I was rea lly pissed off. So some 
fri ends and I began the normal roullne of 
ha ra~~ lng the OppOSl\l On, including the re fer-
ee~ , who were horrible at best. We began 
screaming "You suck I" when they were shoot-
ing free throws, on every call that didn ' t go 
our way. 

What's the UCS Dcrowd reacti on? Mainly 
laughs. You know, these people aren' t used to 
rabid support of the leam, so they fi gured we 
must be doing thi s sarca~ ti ca ll y or somelhing. 
Well , we weren' t. We rea ll y wanted our team, 
OUR team, to win and I can' t fathom how 
others do not understand . 

It was right around this lime that rrealil.ed 
my fr iends and I were quite literally sur-
rounded by Hawk fans. Their reaction to our 
taunting; They talked ri ght back. This i ~ why 

the mound and received ~ome help from her 
teammates. Coach Gerckens' squad put up 
four runs and led by the same score going 
into the bottom of the seventh inni ng. But 
that' s when the wheels fell apa rt. 

By the end of the lirst game, the Tritons 
had committed eight e rro r~ , allowing the 
Eilgb to get back in the game. Concordi a 
~cored four runs in the bottom of the ~event h 
tu knot the c;o nte~t at 4-4. 

Playi ng by International rule~, each team 
received a ~conng chance in the ex tra inning 
(!l th ) wi th a base runner on second ba~e with 
no one out. The Tritons. however. could not 
capitali l.e on the ~i tu a t ion , st randing their 
runner on th ird, while Concordia hrought 
home the wi nning run in the hott om half of 
the eighth inllIng. 

Mary Jane Ott o started the nightcap for 
the dis hea rt ened group. Ohviously ra tt led hy 

I have a problem. 
We were surrou nded by opposing fan~ . 

They we re beckl ing us, knowi ng j ust how 
pathetic the scene was. I was gett ing heck-
led on my home court. T his was j ust wrong. 
I ex ploded. I began swearing and maki ng a 
foo l of myse lf'. But hey. at least I tr ied. So 
hard in fact that after the game some guy 
came up to me and handed me a tract on 
' hris ti anity. By the way, the basketball 

tea m played uninspired In the second half 
and los t by 2 1. Good-bye pomeason . not 
that the genera l UCS D populatIO n (of Id i-
ots) ca res . 

Apathy is what' s killing me about th is 
schoo l. Anyone who knows me knows that 
whi Ie I am certainly not the nag hearer against 
apathy, th is is one thing that rea lly frustrates 
me. / know that there arc more basketba ll fans 
at UCS D than there were at RIMAe last nig ht. 

I participate in the intramural baskctba ll 
program here and it is huge - hu ndreds of 
teams, ollViously interested enough In basket-
ball to pay to play. If less than half of them 
showed up to a ba ketball game here, the 
stands would be full . So why don' t they?They 
have classes, they have to study.· Wah, wah,

the team', inability to close out the firs t 
game. Otto and company fe ll behind 3-0. 

" It was a long day," Olto said. "I walked 
a couple ofbalters and Ijust didn't have it. I 
got nervous and coach pulled me out after the 
fi rst inning." 

U SD clawed back into the game wi th 
two runs to close the gap to a single run , but 
the Eagles pull ed away in the hottom of the 
fi fth , and the game was subsequentl y ca ll ed 
due 10 darkness. 

The you ng squad\ record now drops to 
5-3 on the season. The team play,> a double-
header versus Poi nt Loma thi~ Saturday at 
Tnl!l n Softba ll Stadium. 

" I honest ly th ink that we have a better 
team than the one which p layed la t 
Concord ia!." Otto \aid. "We didn ' t have the 
timely hitt ing today and ou r fie ldl ng miscues 
rea ll y hurt u~ ." 

wah . ry me a ri vcr. 
Do you think the playe rs have it any 

casle r? obody gets a free ride In or ou t of 
thi s ~c hoo l. Just because you' re an at hlete 
at UCSD doesn' t mean you ge t a frec de-
gree. Quite the contrary, you get the shaft. 
The admini . lration doesn ' t care aho ut ath -
leti cs , and probab ly wan ts thi~ sc hool to be 
sole ly academic. If it wa~ up to these ha lf-
wi lled lose rs, the re would he no sports he re. 
Heaven fo rbid hav ing an enjoyable co llege

The professors and adm lni ~tra t ors make it 
a point to announce that no athlete wi ll be 
given specia l treatment. So athletes here prac-
tice for an average of th ree or four hou rs a day. 
Add in the siudyi ng the re~ t or you no-shows 
arc bitching about , and you have a Triton 
st udent-athlete. 

These players (and coaches as well ) g ive 
thei r heart and soul fo r the love of the game 
and the uni versity, and how do we treat them? 
Like dirt. It is nauseating to me. I rea ll y do 
hate you people. you make me sick.

REVENGE: UCSD 
comes out flat against CHC 
Continued from page 16 
plug Nick Marout os helped keep the team 
alive as each hit rour three-pointers, but it was 
not enough. 

"They were a better team than us, obvi -
ousl y," Thimgan said. "Some guys had a 
rough night - Aune was kind of cold , Wall 
was co ld. But they played rea lly well. They 
had more talent than us." 

It was an anti -climactic end 10 the season 
fo r a team that had struggled early hut seemed 
headed for the playoffs . A late-season surge 
had given the men cont rol of their fate, but 
losses in twoof the l a~t four games wi ll likely 
shut them out of the tou rnament. 

ow the men must recover in the ofr-
, eason and build on a successful 1997 ca m-
paign in which they Iln lshed 17-8. Though 
the team wil l lose on ly one senior (A une), 
he wi II be sorely m l ~sed . Player who arc 6-
foo t -!:l and 24() I hs. don' t come through the 
rank !> vcry often. and It will be a tough task 
to co mpensate fo r hi ~ loss in the off-~easo n . 

on the donn lawns at Duke Uni versity how 
great the co llege game i~. Can you imagi ne 
people camp1l1g on lawns here to get in to a 
Tri ton basketball game'! There would bc crie~ 
of. "Get ofT my lawn, I have to ~tud y 0 -
Chem!" or "Look at those fools, I get tu si t in 
a dimly lit room 20 hours a day and do wo rk . 
They wi ll never know the joy of hav ing a 
persona l relati onship wi th TESS, my T-reg 
goddes~ . " 

I want to issue a cha llenge to all those 
people who li ke to watch basketball . sports In 
general. or just Ii ke to go where there arc a lot 
of people haV ing fun . These games arc not

Hey UCSD:

This was the game to make

men. Ir they won, they would 
go to the postseason. Ir not, 
everything they had worked lIO

all the support thcy could get. 
So, it was the biggest game of 
the season for the men's team

RALLY: Down 7-6 in the eighth inning, Chri 
Rondestvedt 's home run won it for the Triton 
By Travis Hili 
Staff Writer 

Vince Lombard i, quite possibly 
the best coach in all or sporting 
history, said it best: " Winning isn ' t 
everyt hing, i t 's th e o nl y 
thing." Winning is what dri vcs 
all o f sport . It is an mdescrib-
able feeling, one of complcte 
\a ti !>fa tlon . That feeling, that 
recognition IS what people are 
willing to ~acrir;l:e almost 
anything for. 

And that feellngl\on that 
the SD ba~chall team has heen 
desperately searching lor in liS la~t 
thrce gamcs. In all three games they 
were so close they cou ld t a~tc it, 
on ly to have thcir de~~ert eaten by 
the fat lady who would never go 
away. 

Ye terday In the hottom of the 
eighth, the Triton hope~ were about 
to be dashed once more. The TrilOn~ 
were down by one run, but they had 
j ust given up the lead. It looked 
suspiciously like they werc going to 
follow the pattern of their laslthree 
games: gel up early, lose in lhe laSI 
few innings. 

In the bottom of the eighth at 

Tnton StadIUm. thl~ young CSD 
~quad wa~ put to the te~t. Another 

los~ would be deva~lating to a team 
of such littleexpenence. A Win how-
ever, could create a wave of mo-

mentum and he the turning 
point of the you ng !.eason. 
But Eli Reichline led ofr the 
inning and nied out to right. 
Then Enl: Pangellnan tapped 
out to the pilcher. Two outs. 
nobody on. Oh no, not again. 

Tony Lin ~ t epped up to 
the platel:arrYll1g ton~ of pre~­

,ure, hut he was not 10 he denied. He 
continued hi~ great day and rippcd 
hiS third hll of the game, a line drive 
single to cen ter that nearly took the 
pitcher\ head off. Kennith Fluharty

Pitching: John Willis did not 
give up an earned run in five in-
nings, and Martin Saiz picked up 
his first win in relief. 

Bats: The line-up came alive, 
lighting up Bulldog pitching for 
eight runs . t'ric Pangelinan led 
the charge with two doubles. 

Defen.e: Three errors lead to 
three unearned runs. Basically, if 
they make less than two errors, 
I'll give 'em a B or higher. 

Coaching: Decisions to put in 
Siaz and Rondestvedt look like 
work of a genius. It also helps that 
both came through in the clutch.
