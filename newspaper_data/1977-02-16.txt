Ombudsman-a term of Scandanavian 
origin, loosely means "representative of the I 
people." As a result of student unrest during 
the 19608, many university campuses across 
the United States instituted their own om-
budsman programs to deal with the 
problems and complaints of students within 
the systems of their resp.(!ctive campuses. 
Presently, however, UCSD has no such 
opera tional grievance system. 

George Murphy, Vice-chancellor and 
o an of S.tudent Affairs, said recently that 
"we are about to promulgate a formal 
student grievance procedure," of which the 
draft policy statement is now being reviewed 
by the General Counsel of the Board of 
Rcgents. He expects the proposal to become 
effective next week, upon its issuance by 
Chancellor McElroy.

Bert Lee, member of the Committee and 

author of the proposal, saw it as "an attempt 
to promote greater trust and interaction 
among the three segments of the University 
population, the faculty, staff and students~ 
which were very antagonistic at the time." 

The plan was presented to the Advisory 
Committee of Student Fee Programs, but 
was not accepted according to Lee, because 
"they were swamped with work at the time 
and did not want to be bothered." Lee went 
on to way, " I still think there 's a need for 
it. " 

Saltman added that, " Some students ft!el

Cabinet-Assembly is 
Coop; AS Compromise 

-........,--..."...".......,-. 

By Paul Watry 
Staff Writer 

In the upcoming student referendum, undergraduates have a choice 
between three model goverrunents. Two of these, the udent Cooperative 
Union and the Associated Students of UC (ASUC) models, are well known 
on campus. One, the Cabinet-Assembly model, is not. 

The Cabinet-Assembly model, authored by Muir student Mark Sindler, 
is basically comprised of two separate bodies, one executive and one 
legislative. These bodies form what Sindler terms a "compromise" 
between the ASUC and the Coop. 

This is the first in a three-part series of articles dealing with tbe 
government models whieh will appear in the upcoming student 
referendum. 

One body, the Assembly, is patterned directly after the Coop, in which 
any student can participate to initiate bills. The other body, the Cabinet, 
IS indirectly modeled after a more traditional student body and serves as 
sort of a "check" for the Assembly, in the bills must pass both-bodies. 
This check, which Sindler contends is missing in the Coop, would get 
more students and special interest factions to define their interest. In this 
way Sindler believes the groups would have to appear, the resulting being 
one faction not able to control the government. 

The Cabinet of Sindler's model is comprised of nine people: eight 
elected from the foUr colleges and one from the Assembly. Legislative 
action, passed from the Assembly, may be vetoed by two thirds of the 
Cabinet. Ide311y, this action would prevent railroading of certain interest 
groups and ideologies; a charge repeatedly leveled against the Coop. 

Model Tries to Incorporate "The Best" 
Sindler explained that he believes the Cabinet-Assembly uses the best 

of the other two models : "This model is trying to incorporate both aspects 
of efficiency such as that which is offered in the ASUC, bvt on the other 
hand, it contains something which the ASUC is lacking and the Coop has: 
a format by which any and all students wishing to participate have an 
access to the system." 

Getting this across to a large nwnber of students has been very difficult 
for Sindler. He admits that the model will have great difficulties in 
winning. ' The Cabinet-Assembly is a model that I thought of, using other 
models as informational sources. No one has ever heard of it before. 
There is no other model like it on other campuses. It is specifically 
designed for UCSD." 

In a recent letter·to the Triton Times (Feb. 140' 1977), Sindler attacked 
the Coop for not recognizing people with different ideologies. In the letter,

High Court Will Reject Bakke Case-Schneider Erratum/ Clarification 
Andy Schneider, External 

Affairs Coordinator, leads as 
active a life as any student-make 
that any three students. In ad-
dition to participating on 
numerous campus committees, 
he usually devotes six days a 
month attending Student Body 
President's Council (SBPC) 
meetings, Regents gatherings, 
and various lobbying exercises. 

Last quarter in a Triton Times 
interview Schneider expressed 
his concerns on a nwnber of 
matters pertinent to UCSD and 
th University as a whole. Time 
has proven the accuracy of his 
statements and predictions, so 
th Triton Times felt it was again 
appropriate to corral Schneider 
and get his views on those 

matters of University interest. 
Schneider stressed the Bakke 

case (which is challenging 
preferential minority treatment 
in admissions programs) as 
being of the "utmost im-
portance," but ventured to say 
that he believes the case will be 
rejected by the Supreme Court of 
Feb. 22. 

" It's time the University of 
California prepared to reorganize 
its affirmative action 
programs," aid chneid r . " It 
seems to me that the University 
has not gone to gr at lengths in 
fulfilling its commitment to af-
firmative action. What w se is 
an elite institution." 

Important Regents M ting 
Schneider pointed to thi s 

Friday's Board of Regents 
meeting as being a time of 
" major considerations," ex-
pecially since the Regents 
Corrunittees on Special Research 
Projects will consider renewal of 
major contracts with the Energy 
Research and Development 
Administration. If renewed, the 
agrCt'lTI lit would provide $3.585 
million in funding for U 's Los 
Alamos and Lawrence Liver-
more Laboratorie , whose lab 
work is devoted mainly to 
weapon re arch. 

" It' morally wrong for the 
University to conduct · w apon 's

Semester Issue Discussed 
A question concerning the quaI:ter vs. semester issue has ~en placed 

on the referendwn ballot through the efforts of the "Independent Students 
for Democracy (ISO)." 

.Alternate Food Service to be Proposed 

AI; a non-partisan, non-political student organization, ISO 1.$ only in-
terested in polling student preference. It has been requested of the 
Elections Board that the results of this question be sent to the Chan-
cellors, Academic Senates, and Student Assemblies of all UC campuses, 
the Bdard of Reg~ts, and the Pre$ident of ~e University. In this way, the 
students of UCSD can have some input into the deCision-making process 
that so greatly affects them. . 

Since ISD has no official position on this question, it can only present a PROPOSAL FOR A STUDENT 
CONTROUED NATIJRAL FOOD 
RESTAURANT 

We ask that Student Center 
Building C be developed as a 
student-controlled alternative food 
selVlce emphasizing vegetarian 
and natural foods and that this be 
implemented by Fall 1m . . 

student Center Building C. the 
proposed food service facility., was 
originally scheduled to open in 
Spring 1976. But. one full year after 
completion, the facility sits 
emptyandllnused. 

The delay in the opening is 
especially sad in view of what the 
building could offer the campus 

community. The facility is one of 
the few on campus that is easily 
aC(''eSSible to all four colleges as 
well as commuters. It is this 
centralness that gives Building C 
the potential to be a social and 
c.ultural gathering place for 
students. 

Such a center would go a long 
way to revitalizing the entire 
student center as well as 
developing a sense of community 
that this university desperately 
needs. 

present campus food selVices. 
Furthennore, since the fac'llity is 
\!urrently funded by the $6 Student 
Center Fee, it must be under 
student control. . 

This propostion seeks to im-
plement the results of a 
professional study which was 
completcd last summer at the 
request of the Student Center 
Board. The feasibility study was 
conducted by the manager of a 
successful natural food facility 
located on the UCSC campus.

brief explanation of each choice. • 
Under the semester system, there would be two terms which would only 

require two registration periods a'nd two final exam periods. It would cut 
down somewhat on administrative paper work. It would . also give 
students more time to deal with sutljects in a particular course. 

A disadvantage of the system is that each term is long compared to a 
quarter. Also, one would normally take less classes per year on the 
sememster system as compared to the quarter system. _ 

The advantages of the quarter system are probably very clear to 
UCSD students. There is the shorter terril and the opportunity for taking 
more classes in the academic year. . 

Some disad,vantages to the system are that a 100week term is relatively 
short to study a subject in any kind of depth. Also, a quarter can be quite 
intense and hurried for students who are used to a semester. 

Again, ISO favors no particular system but encourages all students to 
express their opinions on the q,uestions. ISO strongly urges that students 
think seriouSly about the other referendwn questions and that they 
exercise their right by turning out to vote in the upcoming election. 

Please Do Not Restrict the Bike Shop 
, 

JoeRaddJDg 
IDdepeDdeat Students 

for Demecracy 

Chancellor McElroy: 
I am somewhat dismayed and-

disappointed at your actions 
concerning the UCSD Bike Shop 
and would like to request that you 
reconsider your position. 

Your letter to the San Diego City 
Council, delivered last Tuesday, 
made an "offer' to restrict Bike 
Shop sales to UCSD students only 
(no faculty or staff) without ex-
ploring other alternatives which 
may satisfy the City Council. 

The Rules Committee of the 
Council passed the resolution 
requesting the closure of the Bike 
Shop after a hearing at which no 
University interests were 
represented. I spent last Tuesday 
morning downtown with the Bike 
Shop representative, talking with 
each councilperson (or one of 
hislher staff). My impression is 
that the majority of members felt 
misinformed or misled in this 
matter, and that they would 
support tlie Bike Shop's right to ~ll 
to any clientele it desires, in-
cluding non-University persons. 
Only one councilmember ex-
pressed adamant opposition to the 
Shop. 

I therefore consider your offer to 
rcstrict the Bike Shop's clientele 
unnecessary, and worse than that, 
dangerous. It opens a whole new 
precedent for off-campus groups to 
be able to force the University into 
changing its mode of doing 
business. 

This is ostensibly the end you and 
Assistant Chancellor Ryer are 
working so hard to avoid. Singling 
out the Bike Shop as the 
"sacrificial lamb" in order to 
avoid further attacks on the 
University is unwise and unfair. It 
is a tenent of democratic gover-
nment that rules should apply 
equa lIy to those who are equal. To 
be consistent you should restrict 
the University bookstore, sundry 
store, Friday night films, and 
campus cafeterias to UCSD 
stude nts on I y . 

The University needs to take a 
strong stand in this matter-that it 
will not compromise becawe of 

easily: by presenting the facts to 
the City Council and allowing them 
to defeat the ridiculous resolution 
the bike shop owners managed to 
place before them. 

I therefore ask you fo reconsider 
your position, and to contact the 
City Council to restate your 
position as one of defending the 
Bike Shop's current operating 
·practices. . 

STEVE COLMAN 

Lefties Need Fai r Shake 
The primary p.urpose of a 

university like ours is obviously 
education. In order to get the best 
education possible, classrooms and 
facilities are needed that will 
guarantee all students the best 
possible environment for le~ing. 

UCSD, unlike most schools in the 
country, does not have facilities in 
its classrooms for left handed 
students to take notes on. It 
becomes very dificult for a left 
handed student to take adequate 
notes and write good tests when he 
has to worry about the position he 
has to sit in, in order to reach the 
desk on the wrong side of his body. 

Why not put a fair amount of 
desks in the lecture halls and 
classrooms on the left hand side of 
the chairs so that everyone can 

write and face the front of the room 
at the same time, and so that no 
one has to worry about how sore his 
back will get while taking notes in 
lecture? 

It's only fair-why should anyone 
be forced to take notes on his or her 
lap becawe it Is impossible to 
comfortably reach the writing 
surface? 

I know that it's hard to ap-
preciate this .predicament if you 
are not left handed; if you need to 
be convinced of the problem, ask a 
friend that is left handed and I'm 
sure he'll convince you. Please, I 
ask you, why should being left 
handed be a burden? 

Help your fellow students and 
vote to place left-handed desks in 
the classrooms.

against the Core of the Coop. 

I agreed to insure that the Elections Board 
issue would be discussed, but no motions 
were pre-arranged. Everybody invited to 
come and take a look at the operation of the 
Coop knew that they could vote their minds. 

Since the Coop has not made its operating 
procedures clear to the student body, it's 
easy for the core group to manipulate 

on. The Board voted 3-3 not to put the petition that time Fingerman did not use the time-

. political decisions. Several times I have 
invited large groups of students to the Coop 
who never got a chance to talk because they 
were excluded by rule maneuvering. 

This time we beat the core group on their

what the uproar is a II about.

When a political vote came up it was ex-

on the board to vote. 

Even then prior to the Coop Monday 
meeting, Ray informed the Board that he 
would only continue until his replacement 
had been found. The people who came to the 
Coop meeting simply asked that due to the 
circumstances that a new representative be 
selected since Bergevin had resigned. 

I don't have a high concern for rules. I hold 
a high respect for the integrity of students 
who make agreements with each other. Helt 
that it was my rcsponsibility as a student 
leader to uphold' guidelines which were equal 
for every student and respect our 
agreements. I am against providing special

It was clear to me that the 'Open Letter to 
the UCSD Community' was not open and did 
not provide you with all thC facts to make a 
decision about what has been going on far too 
long. 

You're right we railroaded.

It's time to take student government out of

Commentary 

Fight Against Tradition of ~/Student Class Privilege" 
By Marco UMaDdri 

There are two reasons why I am 
writing this article. The first is to 
expose the growing tendency 
toward student class privilege, and 
the second is to increase political 
debate befo~e the referendwn: . 
Marco LlMondri was one of the 
founding members of the Student 
Cooperative Union. 

At this time in the late Seventies, 
UC student activists are con-
fronted with two roads: 1) 
retention of student class priVilege, 
2) rejection of growing tendency to 
increase student class privileges. 

You may ask, what do I mean 
when I speak of "student class 
privilege?" To expose the in-
stitutional nature of student class 
privilege in UC, four sjrnple 
questions may be asked : Who 
physically builds UC? Who 
maintains it? Who carries the 
financial burden, and who benefits 
from the academic and physical 
structure of UC? 

The answers to these questions 
are obvious to all who have not lost 
their sense of social perception. It 
is construction workers, elec-
tricians, painters, etc, or working 
people who physically build UC. It 
is the clerical and staff workers, 
gardeners, custodians, etc. and 
other working people who maintain 
the physical and bureaucratic 
structure of UC. It is the working 
class, through the state income tax 
structure , who carrys the 
'financial burden' in the con-
struction and maintenance of the 
physical and academic structure of 
UC. 

WhO benefits from all of this? 
The answer is private enterprise. 
The "thinktank" nature of the 
University of' California ob-
jectively supports, through 
research and investments, our 
economic system. OUr economic 
system is based on the concept of 
priv'llte property, which has now 
manifested itself in monopoly 
production. It is clear that the 
monopolies of the military-
industrial complex, biological 
research field and nuclear and 
atomic research all benefit from 
the existence of the University as a 
resource. 

Student class privilege derives 
from the objective benefits offered 
by the University, whether it be a 
professional career or the opening 
of ncw social advantages through 
the channels of the University 
bureaucracy. 

The student class is a social Dot 
economic class. This social class 
derives its total existance from the 
institutional exploitation of otiler 
economic classes, (i.e. University 
employees, taxpayers, etc.) A 
social class is defined here as a 
group of people whose common 
denominator is that of filling a 
common social rolp. (i.P. . "t.udents). 
I use the term "class" in an at-
tempt to clarify the collective 
privilege status this group receives 
in its relation to the rest ot society. 
A "social" class is incapabl.e of 
dealing blows against thl;! 
economic system. _ 

At this point, student class 
privilege is on a rapid upsurge. An 
increase in the material privileges 
of students will objectively support 
the interests of the economic forces 
which control the University. 

In 1977, student class privilege is 
most blatantly manifested in 3 
forms : 1) planned increases in 
quarterly tuition, 2) the recent 
Bakke decision, 3) David Saxon's 
statement of Dec. 1976 which calls 
for fewer enrollment acceptions to 
UC. This clearly represents a tren<\ 
uf increasing difficulty for people 
from the working 8nd lower 
classes to enter the Universities 
they indirectly create. 

Tuition does not pay for either 
the maintenance or the physical 
construction of the University or 
pay faculty alarles. The physical 

and academic structure of UC is 
subsidized by taxpayers and 
working people. Tuition has only 
one objective purpose, and that is 
to exclude certain classes on the 
basis of economic advantage and 
ability. Tuition increases clearly 
support this elitist tendency. 

The Bakke decision is a 
California Supreme Court case 
which rules _as unconstitutional 
UC's Affirmative Action program 
at Oavls. The political con-
sequences of this judiCial decision 
could eventually overturn all af-
firmative action programs for 
women, Third World people, and 
lower income people. The 
California State Supreme Court 
ruled that UC Davis was utilizing 
"reverse discrimination" in ac-
cep.ting students into its medical 
school and was therefore doing so 
illegally. 

David Saxon's statement of 
December 1976 makes clear the UC 
administrative attitude towards 
the character of students entering 
UC's in future years. Saxon stated 
that presently, the " top" 14 
percent of California high school 
students are accepted at UC. 
According to Saxon, the 1963 
California State Master Plan on 
Higher Education states that UC 
should accept only the " top" 8 
percent of graduating high school . 
students. 

This percentage is determined 
by grade point average and test 
scores. Saxon's statement puts 
forward a new policy for the 
University in that the UC will 
decrease enrollment in order to 
respond to the guidelines of the 
196.'1 Master Plan. 

Now that there has been an at-
tempt to define the problem of 
growing student class privilege, 1 
would like to propose ways of 
dealing with it.

UCSD in a few weeks. Students will

student government will be 
secondary to the question of the 
goals of student government. 

At this point, I would like to 
propose a goal, a strategy, and a 
tactic , and attempt to tie them into 
the UCSD experience. If one is to 
accept that the material presented 
herein is a valid representation of 
trends in the University, then it 
seems clear that for organizing 
and educating students-the goal 
should be to heighten the potential 
of utilization of UCSO as a resource 
to ' promote working peoples' 
struggles. 

Simply pot, give the workers the 
resources they have created.

The strategy should be to clarify 
the class struggle at UCSD by 
bringing to light and analysing the 
Bakke Dccision, student class 
privilege, tuition increases, and 
elitist University admittance 
poliCies. 

The tactic should be to utilize the 
resources at · hand, i.e . . student 
government, Communications 
Board, the student Center Board of 
Authority, and classrooms, to 
carry forward the strategy to fight 
against growing student class 
privileges. 

I would submit that only now 
does the question of student 
government become relevant, that 
is, inasmuch as student govern-

Against Library Idea 
"I don't like the idea at all," 

said Schneider. "I'm trying to 
tell as many people as possible 
UCSD's abhorence of the plan. 
The proposal fails to recognize 
the shelf approach to scholarly 
research: It also overlooks the 
importance of individual campus 
libraries. " 

One problem Schneider has 
been contending with is San 
Diego's failure to come through 
with its $6,219 pledge to the 

Student Lobby. "We're not even 
half way ther yet," said 
Schneider, " which naturally 
makes things difficult. It's at the 
point where the Lobby may close 
ooerations for several weeks due 
to financial restrictions . There's 
lot of important work we have t 
do. How can we do it withou 
funds?" 

E.;ven with his busy schedule 
Schneider still urges students to 
" come visit" with him and 
discuss their concerns. He can be 
found in the External Affairs 
Office, located upstairs in the 
Student Center.

Geny Niewood and Timepiece: 
Efficient But Too Excitin.g 

by Ted Navin Burke 
I Staff Writer 

Gerry Nlewood and Timepiece 
(Horizon/ A&M) 

Niewood, playing flute and 
sop-rano saxophone, leads" his 
grO'up through a series of songs 
that is somewhere near the 
progressive bent of ECM recording 
artists(Gary Burton, Ralph 
Towner, Jan Hammer, Keith 
Jarrett,) and the modernized 
co ncept of mainstream jazz 
(l)ubcl't Laws. Freddie Hubbard. 
.John Klemmcr. ) If nothing else, 
the result is one slick package. 
Niewood's abilities on flute are 
passable. His style is lyrical and 
intelligently thought out, and 
shows more imagination than 
some better known players such as 
Herbie Mann and Till) Wiesberg, 
but he plays it safe too often, as 
though afraid tQ.., expand a solo 

beyond the predictable. I prefer his 
soprano sax outings, which 
number only three here. His tone is 
looser and more confident and 
Niewood is more willing to take 
chances, covering wider spaces, 
with deft acceleration in his lines 
when needed. The band, comprised 
of Rick Laird, bass, Ron Davis, 
drums, Michel Donato, acoustic 
bass, and Dave Samuels, Vibes, 
turn in proficient , workman-like 
performances. Samuel's work on 
vibes adds immeas ura bly , 
especially on two John Aber-
crombie compositions. " Ralph's 
Piano Waltz," and "Timeless." If 
Niewood would loosen up, he'd be 
more interesting. Gerry Nlewood 
and Timepiece suffers from 
stylistic indecision at worst. At 
best, it'll make great background 
music while your filling out your 
tax forms.

concert Scene 
Foghat: Up & Coming 

by Tim MilcKeazie 
Arts Editor 

The Sports Arena could not be 
descnbed by anyone as being posh, 
or even comfortable. But it sure 
was cold in the stark dept~ of the 
Arena that they reCer to as 
" backstage." There I was, waiting 
patiently for the Road Manager, 
Ronnie Smith, to usher me into the 
dressing room so I could do my 
interview with Foghat. 

As I stood there rapping with ex· 
Electric Prune Denise Simpson, I 
ooticed the drummer, Roger Earl, 
hop into his Mercedes with his old 
lady and drive out of the Arena 
parking lot. They were followed 
closely by a red Jaguar, with Rod 
Price at the wheel, Craig 
MacGregor riding and 

is that Foghat is fuckin' hot! Rod 
Price plays such a blistering slide 
guitar that you almost expect to 
see smoke coming off of the axe's 

~ck'. Foghat came out with a 
torrid "Fool For The City" and just 
kept rollin' all nig~ long. 

These four lads are among the 
prime exponents of "crotch·rock," 
with a rhythm thallikes to ravage 
its .audience in a most primitiv-e, 
yet effective manner. The newest 
member of Foghat is bassist Craig 
MacGregor, who succeeds in 
giving the music a little extra 
punch. Combined with Roger Earl 
on drums, they give the band an 
extremely potent beat. Price is 
amazingly adaptable on lead 
guitars, be it on a slide solo or with 
some as in

Fogha t Stops at Sports Arena on Way to Stardom . 

,.------~------------------___, - Lonesome Dave crashed in the "Drivin' Wheel" from the new 
Nightsbift LP. Of course, I can't 
forget Dave Peverett, guitarist, 
vocalist extraordinaire and the 
closest thing the band has to a 
punk. Peveretl stayed true to his 
vocals, though his guitar solos 
were very basic and paled in 
comparison with Price's. 

back seat. 
Being the astute person that I 

am, I figured that my interview 
was not going to go too well. I ran 
up to a cool looking dude wearing a 
tour jacket and asked him where 
the hell Ronnie Smith was. He 
looked at me as if I'd spent my life 
underneath a rock, then told me 
"Ronnie's in the hospital. Some 
guy just punched him out." Great. 
No Foghat, no Ronnie Smith, no 
interview. I then left as quickly as 
possible. I .wanted to go home and 
listen to "Drlvin' Wheel" on the 
stereo. 

If :tou want to be high-brow 
about musical styles, it would be 
quite easy to put down a band like 

Foghat. But the fact oC the matter 

Surprisingly, Foghat didn't 
perform much of their new 
Nightsbift LP, opting instead to 
rely on old standards, "Slow Ride" 
and "Maybelline" being the prime 
examples. But then fans love to 
hear the oldies, and the sold-out 
Sports Arena audience was no 
different. To put it quite simply, 
they went absolutely beserk. And 
why not? Foghat is on its way to 
superstardom.

Luther James: True Theater Artist 
He's prepared Diana Ross for 

her role in Lady Slags the Blues 
and he's taught Bill Gosby, 
Godfrey Cambridge as well as 
many other stars. He's also 
directed Broadway plays and 
produced, written and directed for 
television. 

Luther James still teaches 
acting and directs plays. But 
instead of the glamorous environs 
of Hollywood and Broadway, 
James operates within the modest 
sctting of UCSD s cling asso· 
ciate professor of drama. 

He's a man with an impressive 
past. Included among the many 
distinguished places he's taught 
~ are the Lee Strasberg Theatre 
Iii Institute in Los Angeles as well as 

• the Luther James Studio in New ~ York. His entertainment ex· 
o perience is vast and varied. As a 
li television writer and director, he 

~ worked on such programs as Tbe 
Courtship of Eddie's Father, The 

Bill Cosby Show. Julia, Bewlt· 
cbed, and Dattarl. He was also a 
producer for the On Being Black 
series and an executive producer 
for CBS Television Network. He 
directed and assistant directed 22 
theatre productions of Broadway, 
off Broadway, and in Stock. 

So how did he come to teach at 
UCSD? "I was asked to lecture 
here," says James, "and did so 
for two quarters. There came an 
opening in the department and 
they asked me if I'd consider 
coming into it. I accepted-this 
will be my second year." As for 
the drama department, he is 
enthusiastic about it. " I enjoy 
teaching ~ere . The department is 
moving steadily toward better 
and better standards in terms of 
what the department .expects. 
And with the addition of a 
master's program which they've 
achieved in the last couple of 
years, I would say that this school, 

with this faculty , will be one oHhe 
leading university teachers of 
theatrical art In a very short 
time." 

Nestled in his simple bungalow 
office on Matthews campus, 
Luther Jamcs makes plans for his 
current play, The Taking of Miss 
Janie. 

Elegant and poised, he speaks 
with a soft, compelling voice, 
gcntly correcting the labeling of 
his playas Black drama. " I don't 
know if The Taking of Miss Janie 
is in strict terms, Black drama. I 
think it comes from a black point 
of view, but I think its im· 
plications are certainly not 
confined to black members of the 
American society, I think it ad-
dresses something that concerns 
all Americans--which is the 
direction that society has taken 
since the confrontations of the 
1960's. I think it's not necessarv to 
have any black members in the 

. 

audience for that particular 
message to emerge." Director 
James enjoys presenting plays 
which "might strike one as 
needful in socia l' terms." He 
observes that " it's always in-
teresting to find and stage such 
plays because you feel that you're 
giving a gift to the audience. 
Something for them to ponder. " 

Like a lot of directors, James 
started out as an actor in the 
theatre. He graduated in 1959 
form the Dramatic Workshop of 
the New School for Social 
Research which he describes as 
"a post graduate and special 
studies school for the humanities 
and arts." Located in his native 
New York, the school had a 
" really exciting" dramatic school 
at the time he attended. Marlon 
Brando, Rod Steiger, and Harry 
Belafonte were ' some of his 
classmates. Unlike the latter

McDonalds commercials, on the other hand, use as many as 65 different fast-

urgent than it is in real life. This way, the viewer comes to associate 

::~fr1 
McDonalds hamburgers with a very exciting way of life, the American .way of 
life. 

Formal SlmUarltles 
Since both TV commercials and contemporary fine art are " engendered by 

the culture in which they are created," Kurtz feels that there are definite 
formal similarities between them. These similarities were brought out in a 
slide presentation of contemporary artwork. Telj!vision is unique in its em· 
ployment of such aspects as c<>lor spectrum, short duration, small scale, 
repetition, impermanence, tactility, movement, and time dimension. The 
slides exemplified these aspects in the work of modern artists in such fields of 
contemporary art as min imalism , serial imagery (Andy Warhol's Soup 
Cans), environmental and process art (where transformation and change are 
subjects of the pieces,) performance art and kinetic art. In regards to'time 
dimension, Kurtz mentioned the work of Ira Schneider, who is currently 
teaching here at UCSD and is involved with immediate feedback and time 

delay in video. These similarities show a definite parallel between popular 
art and fine art. 

Kurtz is also the author of a book on this subject entitled Spots: The Art of 
Television Commercials, which will be released in April .

classed by their opponents. A 
tighUy-<:ontested meet against 
Whittier several weeks ago went 
down the drain because the team 
had no diver, forfeiting valuable 
points.

Staff Writer 

If you have ever played tennis 
and had trouble getting your serve 
in or you are an athlete with less 
than perfect skills In any other 
sport, you might be interested in a 
modem phenomena known as the 
videotape instant replay. 

The instant replay is being used 
in PE classes at U~D to help 
tennis players improve their 
serves as well as their forehands 
and backhands. Besides tennis, it 
has also been employed in gym-
nastics, dance, badminton, 
swimming and basketball classes. 

.. Any PE instructor can use the 
videotape equipment as a tea~hing 
aid, if he feels it would be helpful," 
remarked. John Cates, assistant 
supervisor of the PE department. 
Cates, who ls also a PE instructor, 
feels that the use of an instant 
replay can be beneficial. 

" In various physical activities 
you make certain mistakes over 
and over again," he said. " By 
seeing an instant replay, you can 
make a correction." 

All the instructors with day 
classes have been trained to use 
the equipment. 

"A novice can't use the equil>' 
ment," commented Cates. " The 
camera is very sensitive; if you 
point it at the sun, for example, it 
can burn out the filament ." 

• Video Improves Form 
The equipment, consisting of a 

camera, a videotape recorder, a 
tripod and a television monitor, 
was fina lly acquired in 1974 after 
five years of trying. 

"It's fantastic ; it really im-
proves the quality of instruction," 
said Cates. " It is invaluable in 
gymnastics because form is so 
important. .. 

"The pointing of the toes is so . 
important in dance," continued 
Cates. " With the videotape 
machine you can stop the routine 
and analyze the tape replay." 

Cates feels the instant replay is a 
great asset in tennis instruction. 
"I try to tape the kids at the 
beginning of the quarter and also 
at the end, so they can see the 
amount of improvement." 

Some instructors feel that cer-
lain people get so wrapped up in 
seeing themselves on the screen 
that they forget to watch their 
technique. Cates believe~ that 
after the first viewing, the novelty 
effect wears off. 

An instructor with 'some 
foresight can budget the expense of . 
paying an assistant to help operate 
the machinery. 

Even though this expense is 
small, some instructors don 't 
utilize the tape machine. Cates 

"Some feel that the 

A nurry of illnesses and injuries 
have made winning hard to come 
by as the visiting Triton swim team 
competed against Pomona-Pitzer 
Friday, and also at the Santa 
Barbara Invitational over the 
weekend. 

" With everyone there, we should 
beat the," quipped coach Gary 
Becker. 

But without swimmers such as 
Mark Allen, who was injured in a 
surfing accident , and Albe.rt 
Williams, the team's top but-
terflyer, winning won't come easy. 

Reflecting on. the past season, 
coach Becker said he felt that 
scheduling and the availibility of 
the facility time adversely affected 
the team's effort . 

The 

The team's individual per-
formances have been highlighted 
by sprinter Guy Bucca Man, who 
ou\swam the competition at both 
Pomona-Pitzer and Santa Bar-
bara . Winning the freestyle events 
at both 50 and )(10 yards, BucaMan 
established the top team marks in 
these events with respective times 
of 22.5 and 51.5. This clocking foJ' 
the 50 yard freestyle is a new 
school record . 

The swimmers have by no 
means , been completely out-

"Our season doesn't start until 
January, and since we're not in a 
league, our last meet is a month 
and a half later. We need a longer 
season to realize our potential. " 

"Also, there needs to be more 
time for the swimmers to use the 
facilities, which is impossible now 
due to the school's heavy 
scheduling. 

" If these problems aren't solved 
somehow, swimming will continue 
to be a low-key program at this 
school. "

takes away from precious class 
time." 

The use of the videotape has been 
limited in intercollegiate sports 
because of a lack of personnel to 
operate the machine. 

"PE instructors are more apt to 
use the instant replay because once 
they start their class, they can 
operate the equipment them-
selves," said Judy Sweet, Inter-
collegiate Athletic Director at 
UCSD. "But coaches must stick 
around with their teams. " 

Cates points to the student as the 
primary reason for using the In-
stant replay . "They like another 
teaching aid," he said. 

Especially, if it helpa them get

[Continued from Page 5] 
performers, James soon got into 
directing. "I started directing 
because I didn't have the amount 
of opportunities as an actor that I 
wanted, so I started to mount 
plays. People talked about how 
good the acting was, so it ended up 
with my not getting more work as 
an actor, but being asked if I'd 
direct and teach. And of course 
that's how I started as a direc-
tor/teacher." 

James noted the changes Black 
theatre has undergone since he 
started as an actor. "There was 
no such thing as Black theatre 
when I started. There were black 
people in plays and there were 

some plays written by black 
people. but the direction of plays 
written by blacks has changed 
profoundly since I've come into 
the theatre. It's now, to a great 
extent, theatre that points to and 
asks for po Utica I soiutlons to 
American problems. 

Composed and thoughtful in 
voicing his words, Luther James 
also added that he was "deter-
mined to contribute artistically no 
matter where and in what context. 
But if one's life i~ as a theatre 

artist, one's only hope is that 
you're able to continue that and 
hopefully better than you've done 
it before." - Margare1 Hewey
