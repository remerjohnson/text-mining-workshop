Letters to the Editor 

Engineers do have hearts ... 
Editor: 

Tn response to your Jan . :{ 
article, "Do Eng-i n er~ Have 
More Fu n?," we feel a great 
dea l of ym pathy for t he 
aut hor. He is understandablv 
disi ll usioned \\ it h society's 
money oriented value system, 
but his \ iews w hich attempt to 
equate t he disc ipline of engi· 
neering with materialism and 
Insensitivity are ludicrou!:>. 

In ana lyzing Mr. Ensign 's 
article one not ices t hat a sim 
pJr de letion of the firsl and l a~t 
sentcnces leaves the reader 
confused as to whom he IS 
attacking. The resl of the arll' 
cle could apply to any profes-
sional who earns a salary 
comparable to that of an engi-
neer. To whom then is \ 1r. 
EnSIgn \entmg hl~ frustra· 
lion", engIneers or anyone who 
makl:" more than $2,DOO a 
mtlnt h' 

Apparently Ihe author has 

litt le re~pect for women. lI is 
image of t he salesgirl who 
"".wants to touch you and get 
gifts from you and squirm 
wit h you in lust and pas-
sion"." is sexist and offensive. 
Perhaps Mr. Ensign bel ieve~ 
that the amount of 10\ e t hat an 
engineer can show for a person 
is inversely proportIOnal to his 
income. l\1r. En~lgn's article 
tota lly ignores the IIlcreaslIlg 
number of women who are 
pursuing careers in engi neer· 
ing. Do they spend their mone\' 
in the same fashion as thei'r 
male counterparts? 

While many might belic\e 
that engi neers are on hinter· 
ested III building IXJIlibs and 
tanks , achie\'emel1ls \\ hich 
make the cleaf hear. the bl ind 
see, and the paral} zed \\ alk 
could hanl\\' be COnCel\'l>d 111 
selfIsh. heartless minds.

4 The UCSD Guardian 

Emperor's Clothes 
continued from page 3 
honest officer of t he part y, to 
see how the budget was doing, 
and if it wou ld soon be 
balanced. He fared just like the 
first; he looked and looked , 
but. as there was nothing to be 
seen but vacant CRT screens. 
he could see nothing. 

" Is not that a beautiful 
budget?" asked the two 
rogues; and they di spl ayed and 
explained the complex jargon 
which was not there at all. 

"1 am not st upid !" thought 
the man . " It must be my good 
office, for which 1 am not fiLlt 
is funny enough, but J must 
not let it be noticed." And so h 
praised their hard work, and 
expressed his pleasure at the 
belt -tightenig of useless 
programs. "Yes, it is 
balanced," he told th 
Emperor. 

All th people in town were 
talkingof the ba lanced budgeL 
The Emperor wished to ~ee it 
himself whi le it was sti ll being 
worked up. With a whole 
crowd of chosen men, among 
whom \\:ere also the two 
honest state,>men \\ ho had 
already been there, he \\ent to 
the t\\:o cu nning rogue~, who 
we r e no \\ cut tin g and 
ba lan Cing without fact or 
figure. 

"Is not that brilliant?" said 
the t wo :--tate~men, who had 
already been t here once. "Does 
not your Majesty remark on 
the au~terity and the defen..,e 
budget?" And t hey pointed to 
the empty computer. for they 
thought that the other~ cou ld 

~ee the budget. 
" What's this?" thought the 

Emperor. "\ can !-lee nothing at 
all! ThaI i~ terrible. Am I 
stupid? Am I not fll to IX' 
Emperor? That \\ould be the 
Illo:--t dreadful thing that could 
happen to me." 

"0, It IS quite bnlllant!" he 

said aloud . " It has our highest 
approbation." And he nodded 
in a contented way, and gazed 
at the empty computer, for he 
wou Id not say t hat he saw 
nothing. The whole Cabinet 
whom he had with him looked 
and looked. and saw nothing, 
any more than the rest; but, 
like the Emperor, they said, 
"That is a nice budget!" and 
counseled him to present it to a 
great press conference that 
was presently to take place. " It 
is splend id . excel lent!" went 
from mouth to mouth . On all 
side t here seemed to be 
general rejoicing. and the 
Emperor gave the rogues the 
title of White House aides. 

The whole night before the 
morning on which the press 
conferenc was to take place, 
the rogues were uP. and kept 
more than sixteen secretaries 
working. The people cou ld see 
that they were hard at work, 
completing the Emperor's 
balanced budget. They 
pretended to take whole reams 
of computer printouts from 
the computer, they made great 
cuts at random and at last I he\' 
said, " ow the budget i~ 
ready!" 

The Emperor came himself 
with hiS noblest advisors: and 
the two rO!,TUes lifted up one 
arm as if they were holding 
something. and said, " ee, 
here is 'ocial Securitv! Here i~ 
Health. Educatl()n and 
Welfare! Here is the J cw 
Federalism!" and so on. 

"Yes," said all the ad\lsors; 
but they could not see 
an) thing, for not hing was 
there. 

"Will your Jmpenall'vl aJest~ 
please to condescend to break 
protocol and aeldres,> Congress 
directly?" said the rogues. 
"Then we will present the ne\\ 
budget on t he II Ill." 

"Well, ves, I am readv ," saiel 
the Emperor. "Doc.., [hI.., not 

make me an hi!-lLoncal figure?" 
And he looked down on hiS 
desk, for he wished to appear 
10 deep reflect IOn upon the 
balanced budget. 

So the Emperor stood in the 
great hall of legi"lature and 
addres!-Ied a joint session of 

(()ngre~.., and c\'er~ one in the 
Capitol said, " 11<m incompara'

All Dregged up and 
rearing to rock 
The hot little band from Dixie will 
perform tonight at 8 in Mandeville 

By TlJII AUGUST 
There is probably no other 

band around that so success-
fully combines the best of rock, 
jazz fusion, classical. funk, and 
full blown honky-tonk country 
into an eclectic and exciting 
brand of instrumental music 
l ike The Dregs do, In fact their 
sound b so unique you'd be 
unlikely to hear anything sim-
ilar: which should be good 
incentive to see them in concert 
tonight at Mandeville Center 
Audilorium, 

to do a number of encores to 
satisfy the crowd, 

The band's core members are 
guitarist Steve Morse and bas-
sist Andy West. Morse is one of 
the few great gu itarists whose 
showmanship revolves around 
pure talent and no pretense, 
Morse is also one of the few guit-
arists that tours with a guitar 
synthesizer--and knows how to 
use it. He manages to conjure up 
some interesting patches that 
lend an additional aural excite-
ment to hb lead work. Nowhere else but The Dregs 

wi II find intricate three and four 
part harmon ies with electric 
guitar, violin, keyboard.s and 
bass woven around a tight 
rhythmic background ; which 
they combine with incredible 
solo work by all of the musi-
cians in the band. 

West on the other hand pref-
ers a more conventional sound 
but often amazes his audience 
by playing melodic lines just as 
fast and accurate as the blazing 
guitar and keyboard work. 

Their publicity photo may be out of focus, but the Dregs' musk is certainly clean and sharp_ 

Not only is their music a wel-
come break from your average 
fusion fare but The Dregs live 
shows are also exceptional. Last 
year at SDSU they proved that 
excellence doesn't necessitate 
pretentiousness by delivering a 
straightforward and energetic 
concert despi te obvious road 
weariness. The show in fact Wii'> 
a huge success demonstrated by 
the fact that the band was forced 

Drummer Rod Morgenstein is 
one of the few remaining people 
who play double kick drums as 
they were intended to be played. 
He often punctuates breaks with 
rolls from the kick drums rather 
than snare, which adds a power-
ful flair to The Dregs style. 

approach to melody, In fact 
both Lavitz and Morse are con-
sistently voted top musicians 
on their respective instruments 
by both tans and music critics 
alike. 

They brought in Santana 's Alex 
Ligertwood to sing on Crank It 
Up," and the Doobie Brothers' 
Patrick Simmon'> to sing on 
another track. While Crank It 
Up was a marginal su cces,> as a 
single and Industry Standard 
was The Dregs' bestsell i ng of 
their seven records . it failed to 
bring them into the realm of 
commercial succes~, 

their frustrat ion, I'm sure) and 
hale made their shows hale a 
partylike atmosphere rather 
than the impersonal tel'l ing you 
get at larger venues. 

With tonigh t'~ 8pm ~ho\\ In

ranteed to. be the ca~e. cating

admission, Tickets Jrc a\ ailable 
at the student center box offlCC 
and Ticketron For morc infoma-
t ion call 452-45.59, 

Multi-keyboardist T Lavitz 
also has created some unique 
synthesizer patches and also 
embellishes the music with a 
good deal of texture, evening 
out the band 's often stark 

But despite all the things The 
Dregs seem to have going for 
them, they have yet to come up 
with a hit. Their last album, 
Industry Standard. tried to 
overcome this by adding two 
cuts with vocals in hope.., of gar-
nering much needed airplay. 

But one advantage to this is 
that it has kept the size ot their 
live audiences small. (much to

'Reds' and 'Cat People'lead 
Penguin film series schedule ---AT THE MOVIES-

By CLYOEl'n: Nt:[ 
With the rising cost of school. 

you have probably asked your-
self: what type of entertainment 
can I buy with five dollars? The 
Penguin film Society in associ-
ation with the film Committee 
at the University Events Office 
has brought together some clas-
sic art and foreign films for the 
Tuesday Night Penguin film 
Society Series. and membership 
to the seven film series is only 
five dollars. 

The Penguin film Society is 
the brainchild of senior writing 
major Michael Litt. Last quarter 
his series included such films as 
The Wizard of Oz and The Mis-
fits. He started this society 
becuase he felt that the types of 
films presented on campus 
didn·t include films that 
appealed to all audiences. 

" People who show films on 
campus are interested in mak-
ing money. or they have politi -
cal views they want addressed. 
or they are the big block-buster 
films:' says Litt. 

Litt has worked with the Uni-
versity Events Office in the 
selection of the film titles. and 
the University Events Office is 
doing the publicity for the films 
and the series. 

'Tm really excited about the 
films for winter quarter. I think 
that people at the university are 
intelligent and worldly. The type 
of film that would appeal to the 
average viewing audience would 
not necessarily appeal to the 
college-age student. If you 
wanted to see films like these 
you would either have to go 
downtown. to the Ken Cinema or 
the Guild. Now we have them 
available for students on cam-

"This is also a chance to 
expose people to good foreign 
and art films that they might 
not normally see. The Tin Drum 
and Breaker Morant are repre-
sentative of some of the good 
new foreign films today; f1 by 
Fritz Lang and Beauty and the 
Beast by Jean Cocteau are good 
classic films that respectively 
represent German and French 
film-making from an earlier era.

film makers were different then.

The Tin Drum is the first film 
of the series which starts next

January 6. J 98'} Hiatus 5 



. , 

By ROBBI[ ILO"[ 
CrItic .1 IMgr 

I know, he didn't live; and his 
life was only in the pages of the 
Strand magazine and various 
novel publishers and why bother 
about it anyway. However, 
belive it or not, Sherlock 
Holmes is believed to have been 
born on January 6, 1854. Just 
about the time that the last 
expedition was sent out for Sir 
John Franklin. who was last seen 
some 16 or 18 years before in or 
about the Landcaster Sound. So 
much for Franklin. Now for 
Holmes. 

A Hiatus happy birthday to the 
elementary Sherlock Holmes 

it's good enough for me. 
One of the strange things 

about Holmes is the way people 
turn sort of green when you talk 
about reading one of the origi-
nal Strand stories in a facsimile 
version. I'm sorry, but a facsim-
ile edition, with its Sidney Paget 
illustrations and the clues pres-
ented in their full and complete 
glory, is the only way to read 
Holmes. It is also the way to get 
the best stories, before the pub-
lic would swallow anything 
about Holmes, and while Doyle 
still had his standards. 

Sherlock Holmes first 
appeared in the novel. A Study 
in Scarlet. If you want the rest of 
the gory details, the best place 
to start would be John Dickson 
Carr's excellent biography. How-
ever, most critics, incl uding 
yours truly, definitely feel that 
the greatest manifestations of 
Sherlock Holmes would be 
found in the first 24 stories Sir 
Arthur Conan Doyle penned for 
The Strand, beginning with the 
slighly lame "A Scandal in 
Bohemia, " and ending with the 
great "The Adventure of the 
Final Problem. " 

The basic influences of these 

stories led to the later success 
of such writers as Maj Sjowal and 
Per Wah 100, Ed McBain, Isaac 
Asimov (you've never read 
Caves of Steel or The Naked 
Sun?), Agatha Christie, and my

own perswonal favorite, William 
Marshall. Of course, Holmes 
simply isn't enough in the sto-
ries. People want to use Holmes' 
own tricks on the Great Detec-
tives. 

So, when Holmes' hirthday is 
mentioned, you are only talking 
about the opinion of most scho-
lars. But, if the guess is good 
enough for the Grounds for 
Murder bookstore's newsletter. 

The edition I have on the desk 
beside me includes such clas-
sics as "The Adventure of Silver 
Blaze," the incomparable "The 
Adventure of the Reigate 
Squire, " where we have an hon-
est chance to solve the mystery 
a long time before Holmes does, 
lhe ludicrous "The Adventure of 
the Yellow Face," where Holmes 
blows it good, and "The Man 
with the Twisted Lip." This is 
good stuff. This is the best there 
ever was. This is all in The Com· 
plete Adventures and Memoirs 
of Sherlock Holmes. So cele-
brate Holmes' birthday, and 
read a mystery short story 
today.

Not to be outdone by other 
aft publications (the imagini' 
tively titled Aft section of the 
San Diego Union, the L.A. 
Times' Calendar, The Reader, 
etc.) Hiatus has compiled a list 
of what we feel to be the best 
albums of 1982. Also included 
in this section are the lists and 
comments of Assorted Vinyl and 
I\5DT. 

Hiatus Top 10 
I. Peter Gabriel Peter 
Gabriel (4) Gabriel's most 
successful album commercially 
to date. This work has all the 
power and soul of his previous 
albums yet offers a more access-
ible medium. By far the best 
album of the year. 
2. King Crimson Beal . • 
Very solid , tight and innovative 
music. Beat brings together the 
technical expertise of Fripp's 
guitar worl, with the musical 
empathy of Adrian Belew, Bill 
Bruford and Tony Levin. Defi -
nitely music for the eighties. 
3. Wall of Voodoo CaU of 
the West Wall of Voodoo rede-
fining its quasi-country/ western 
style to be more thanjust a gim-
mick. Here the synthesizer is 
used not as a toy to create silly 
little noises but as a bona-fide 
instrument to work within their 
own musical niche. 
4. The Clash Combat 
Rock If you can go beyond the 
stigma that the Clash has deve-
loped by getting overplay on 
mainstream radio and actually 
listen, you will find a band that 
has something to say. Very pow-
erful music with a meaning. 
5. Peter Townsend AU the 
Best Cowboys Have Chinese 

Our Tops in Pops for the 
twisted musical year of 1982 
Eyes following the success of 
Empty Glass, Townsend begins 
to see that the aged Who is no 
longer the best vehicle for his 
music. Compare this album with 
It'S Hard and see which you 
prefer. Hopefully Townsend will 
not die with the Who; his music 
only gets better as he goes on. 

6. The English Beat Spe 
cial Beat Service Good dance 
music. 
7. Dane Connover Trees 
Euro-style synthi-pop from San 
Diego's own Dane Connover. 
Very imaginative lyrics 
intertwined with traditional 
synth muzak. 
8. Joe Jackson Night and 
Day Another damn good 
album from the man who made 
dentures respectable. The lyri-
cal content often moves into 
veins of si lIiness, but overall it 
is one of the best pop albums of 
the year. 
9. The Psychedelic furs-

forever Now Riding on the 
new trend towards psychedelia, 
the Psychedelic Furs produced 
their best work in 1982. Overall 
this album is a well polished 
revival of psychedelic music but 
omitting the flighty idealism of 
the sixties. 
10. Men at Work Business 
as Usual This is the band that 
uses almost every pop cliche 
known to modern music. Clever, 
catchy little tunes meant to 
make you dance. 

AS Vinyl's Top 10 
1. Peter Gabriel Peter 
Gabriel (4). Simply the best and 
most intense album of the year. 
Innovative and intelligent. 
Gabriel shines in his deepest 
album to date. 
2. English Beat Special 
Bea t Service. The most 

Peter Gabriel - l.p of the year 

serious Beat album yet as The 
Beat dances us in a new 
direction. 
3. Psychedelic furs fo -
rever Now. A riveting album 
from this "Bowiesque" English 
group, this disc surpasses their 
previous attempts. 
4. Elvis Costello Imperial 
Bedroom. This angry young man 
gives us a package of not so 
angry love songs that is as slich 
as anthing previous. Give it 
much more than one listen. 

5. Joe Jack.son Night and 
Day. Joe shows bravery by ven-
turing away from the rock and 
roll norm, and comes up With a 
New York type album that is 
intensely listenable. For those 
not afraid to admit it. it is hi'> 
best. 
6 . Men Without Hats -

Rhythm of Youth. Incredibly 
danceable This collection of 
upbeat songs arc in a cia .... all by 
themselv~ . We guarantee that 
you II enjoy this album (a\'aila 
ble on import only'. 
7. The Clash Combat Rock. 
Need we say morc. 
8. X Under tile Big Black 
Sun. Even though the L.A. 
underdogs signed with a major 
label. this album is anything but 
a sell out. Everything we would 
expect from X. 
9. Men at Work Business 
as Usual. Believe it or not. the 
rest of the album is as hook-
laden as the two smash hits. 
Maybe the best straight pop 
album by a new group this year. 
10. ABC The Lexicon of 
Love A sensuous, lush collec-
tion of songs by Britain 's 
number one group The slickest 
pop, dance album of the year. A 
bri lIiant debut. A must. 
11 . Yazoo Upstairs at 
Eric ·s. Twisted technopop. 
12. Roxy Music Ava/on. 
Incredibly smooth. Similar to 
flesh and Blood but even more 
melodic.
