along with the 
Association (GSA) 
opposed the proposal 
grounds that UCSA was 
misaUocating resources in 
concerning itself with issues 
which do not directly affect 
students. The A.S. at UC 
Riverside and UCLA's GSA 
abstained . 

"These are important issues, 
but it doesn 't mean they directly 
affect students as students. I 
think students should be 
encouraged to know about it, but 
I don't believe UCSA can afford 
to deal with peripheral issues," 
Eric Weiss, UCSD A. . Vice 
President of External Affairs 
contends. 

Mi hael Berry, UCSA 
President, does not believe 
actions taken by the student 
advocacy will afect other issues 
such as student wages, UC lab 
safety, affirmative action, and the 
Reagan Administration's financial 
aid cuts. 

"\ don't believe that the 
resolution will divert UCSA 
resources," according to Berry. 
UCSA will give the Nicaraguan 
Issue "facilitative priority," 
according to Johannes Van Vugt, 
UCSA ocial Respon ibility 

ommittee member, and Board 
of DIrect rs member.

along with the fear that

Van Vugt 

The original draft of the 
document was """.uered down" 
prior [0 the final vote, according 
to Greg McCambridge, UCSA 
representative from UC San 
Diego. Resolutions which implied 
an active role on the pan of the 
UCSA, in dealing with Ni aragua, 
were altered to clarify the issue 
in tenns of student impact 

"It is a partisan issue and 
some student might not agree 
with it. Our (UCSA members)

Tipsy taxis to 
chauffeur 
UCSD drinkers 
By PETER MESSROBIAN, Sraff Writer 

As of last Friday, there is an alternative to drinking and driving available to UCSD students. Instead of attempting to steer yourself home while inebriated, you can call the Yellow 
Cab Company at 234-6161 between 9:00 pm and 3:00 am every 
Friday and Saturday (except during Easter vacation) and they'll do 
the driving for you. 

The service is free to UCSD students, who need only have their 
student identification with them. A voucher must also be signed 
that voids UCSD of any liability in case of an accident. 

Johnny Patterson, Third Sophomore Senator, together with Russ 
Helig, Muir Sophomore Senator, are running the Tipsy Taxi 
program. Patterson credited Craig Gomberg with the original idea, 
but said he dropped out before anything was done. 

"We started calling up cab companies ... and we needed [to find] 
one with a million dollar [insurance] policy for UCSD's 
[requirements]," said Patterson. As it turned Out. Yellow Cab was the 
only company that fit the bill . 

Anthony Palmeri, the Vice-President of Yellow Cab, said that his 
company has paltlcipated in many similar programs open to the 
general pUblic, especially around Christmas and New Year's. 
However, he said that "this is the first time (the company has] done 
this with a university on a yearly basis, and I don't know if it will be 
successful or not." Palmeri reported that the other programs have 
been "very successful," and that his drivers were ready for the start 
of the new service. 

The Tipsy Taxi service wiU be paid for out of the Associated 
Students' (A.S.) general and allocated budget, which consists of 
student funds. The A.S. is receiving a twenty percent discount off 
regular cab fares. Even so. the price will be high. "It's an expensive 
venture for the AS. to do, but the benefits that come from it are so 
great. .. it's wonh every penny," Patterson said. 

UCSD Police Sergeant Bob Jones agreed. When asked whether or 
not he thought students would actually use the service, he replied, 
'That's the $64,000 question. I know that a lot of people take 
advantage of similar services during the holidays." Concerning the 
Tipsy Taxi effolt, Jones felt that "human nature being what it is , 
there's always a few who drink too much [and], from my 
perspective, the program is a good idea. We lose people all the time 
and, in fact, I recently lost a friend who was killed by a drunk 
driver." 

The Tipsy Taxi service may be used by UCSD students only, who 
may ride as many times as they wish . They may ride from anywhere 
to anywhere within an area bordered by Solana Beach in the north , 
Mission Beach in the south , and Interstate 15 (about five miles 
inland from UCSD) in the east. Yellow and black cards displaying 
the slogan "Stay Alive, Don't Drink and Drive" and Yellow Cab's 
phone number will be distributed around cam pus. ~

Proposal accelerates shuttle plan 
By JOHN SHAW, St'Ollor scalf WmtT 

A campus shuttle system may be implemented in the near future, if 
Associated Students (AS.) 
Commi ssioner of Operations, 
Services and Enterprises DaVId 
Mar hick gets his wa y. Marchick 
addressed the A~. Coun il. a 
week ago last Monday, asking for 
support of his proposal. 

Marchick's shuttle proposal is 
identical to the one cited in the 
Strawman Report , a ' 
comprehensive campus growth 
outline drafted by the Campus 
Planning OlTice. The Strawman 
Report caUs for, among other 
things, aU student parking to be 
moved to periphery lots. Next 
year, a large 1,150 space lot will 
be constructed north of the 
existing parking areas at Third

College; however, the distance 
from the new lot to classrooms IS 
substantial. 

In an effort to compensate for 
this, the report calls for a 
number of 25 passenger mini· 
buses to ci rcle the campus and 
transport students to key 
locations . 

The trawman Repon targets 
the shuttle system to be 
implemented in 1991 , but 
Marchick feels it is needed now. 
According to Marchick, "[ the 
proposal] is consistent with 
Strawman, but it is an 
acceleration of one program." 

. The shuttle report suggests 
four options to be considered. 
There will be one central campus 
loop serving 20 shuttle stops that 

will take 30 mmutes to complete . 
The fi rst option IS to have two 
buses on this loop from 7 am to 
7 pm providmg l5 minute 
service at a cost of <; 131 ,944 per 
nine months. The second option 
IS to add a 60 minute feeder 
loop th at would serve Scripps 
Institute of Oceanography/ Coast 
Apartments and the cast 
campus/ Mesa Apallments from 7 
am to 7 pm at a cost of $186,129 
per nine months. 

The third option is to have 
twO buses running the ccmral 
loop from 7 am to 7 pm and 
have one bus run the same route 
from 7 pm to midnight. This 
option would COSt $146,466 per 
nine months. The final option is 
a combination of the first three 
where twO buses would run the

campus loop from 7 am to 7 pm. 
one bus would run the campus 
loop from 7 pm to midnIght. and 
one bus would run the feeder 
loop from 7 am to 7 pm. This, 
the most expensive and 
comprehenSive option, would 
cost <;211.806 per nine months. 

The shuttle IS not a 
replacement for building new 
parking structures and lots. It is 
however, according 10 Marchick, 
"a n economically feaSible shon 
term solution to many of the 
problems students are faCing." 

Marchlck feels that the shuttle 
would not only save time for 
students. but would also serve as 
an aid in maintaining security in 
the parking lots and on campus. 
The night service would 
elimina te the need for students 
to walk to thcir cars at night 
from on-campus events and 
libraries.

along Torre y Pines Road will be 
elImInated and the lot next to 
Extension will be replaced by 
Third College housing. This will 
undoubtedly increase the number 
of students pa rking on campus. 
As th is number increases, more 
a nd more students will be forced 
to use the furthest lots from the 
maIn campus. Marchick hopes to 
alleviate some of the problems by 
Implementing the shutt le system 
as soon as possible . 

Marchick hopes to gain A.S. 
endorsement before AS. 
Represe ntative Dave Manheim 
asks the Parking and Alternative 
Transportation Advisory 
Committee to consider 
accelerating the program at this 
Friday's meeting. It is this 
commi ttee that will recommend 
whether or not the shuttle system 
should be implemented earlier 
than scheduled and how the 
program shall be funded . Iill

1983 ftlm The Day Alter, that it 
beslcged I[S fri ends of ABC for 
an opporrmllty to set the

caved into the McCarrhyitc

scandal, often dubbed 
Iranscam/Conrragate. It is also 
believed that If the United tates 
did invade , it would most likely 
end up fighting a long and 
protractcd war in icaragua and 
possibly all over Central Amenca. 
ThiS could Involve a death lOll of 
up to 20,000 U.s. troops and 
50,000 or 60,000 Central 
Amencans, Including man)' 
students, friends of students, and 
relatives. We also must protest 
because the Reagan 
Administration has broken both 
United Sta tes and international 
law, specifically Tide XVIll . 
section 956 which makes 
unlawful any conspiracy "to 
Injure or destroy specifi 
property situated Within a 
foreIgn country with which the 
United tates is nOl fonnaly at 
war and Title IVlII. section 960 
(the eutrality Act). which makes 
illegal any act that "prepares a 
means for. or takes pan In . any 
military or naval expedlllon 
agamst any other (Quntrie m 
peacetime." Here we arc refeTTlng 
to the Illegal mining of the 
NIcaraguan harbor In 1984, and 
the iUegal money-laundering for 
the contras that has occurred 
over the past two years. Your 
comments? 
Hallin: I think there are a couple 
of things [ would quibble With 
about the analysis, although In 
genera\. I agree with the Spirit of 
it. [ would be very surprised if 
they really had firm plans to 
Invade icaragua at a specific 
time. I think that, In the long 
run, the pOSSibility of some very 
direct u.s. military involvement 

It 's not difficult to get the 
connection. 

IS not to be dlscountcd . The 
Rcagan Adminlstrmion has a vcry 
strong IJcologica l commitment 
and has always said that. II the 
onll-as couldn 't Win , It would be 

nece sary 10 end U . troops; 
very few observers of Central 
America havc sa id that the 
cOntras can Win . It remains to be 
seen as to whether the Rcagan 
Administration will follow 
through With that; however. the 
Ideological ommitmenr IS very 
deep and this is a kind of 
national commitment the United 

tatcs has made that is difficult 
10 pull back fro m. I would add 
thaI I think thIS IS a vety rucial 
pCrlod in the history of U. 
Involvement with the contras 
because of Irangate . If Congress 
goes ahead and appropria tes 
money at thiS point 10 continue 
finding the contras, I th ink both 
pallies arc comm itted 10 
ovcnhrowi ng the ' icaraguan 
government and If the contra 
fall. I think the pressure will be 
very strong for them to go ahead 
and gct the Untted Statcs 
Involved marc directly. I'm not 
so sure about whether your 
figures about the number of 
pcople killed are true. I'm not so 
sure that the s enano IS reall), 
accurate . It IS Important to 
remember that icaragua is a 
veT)' small country of 3 mill ion 
people and to imagine that the 
war would reach Vietnam-like 
proportions is unrealistic. Partly, 
because despite aU the cold-war 
rhetonc, very little assistance 
goes to Ni aragua from Ihe Soviet 
bloc. We're not looking at the 
possibility of another Vietnam, 
nor another Grenada. If there 

Both rail and bus services

;\J ICaragu,l\ls , and cenaml)' some 
Amcnc.ms would also be killed 
In th e long-run . what lI'e woulu 
h.lVe IS a war of 10\11 Intensity 
confli ct. where we would be 
involved perhaps in a military 
quagmire, and cenainly in a 
polllical quagmire . Another 
In teresting questi on I would like 
to add is what wi ll happen to 
the contras when they finally 
losd Will they end up in Miami , 
Houston. or an Diego, will they 
wind up running drugs around 
the world? 
Foroohar: I would like to pick up 
on your last pOint fi rst 
co ncerning what would happe n 
to the contras if they were 
abandoned by the United States. 
We alreildy have an example of 
what has happened to a force 
like them. as in the Cuban eXile 
whose staged the Bay of Pigs 
invaSion. Most of the contras will 
end up In Miami drug traffj king 
and II1volved In other illegal 
activi tics. These are the type of 
people who can be used for 
Illegal aClivities, the CIA can use 
their type of expertise, thcy have 
u_ed the Cuban exiles 111 similar 
C)'pe actiVIties before. 

In tertn of the U.S. plans for 
inv<lding Nicaragua, I believe the 
Reagan Administration had a 
plan for invading Nicaragua In 
1984 at the time of both the u.s. 
and Nicaraguan Presidential 
Elections. One of the reasons 
why they decided not 10 do it 
was because of the unpopularity 
of the policy. The Reagan 
Admmistration wants the 
American people to fo rget about 
Viemam, but the Americ4n 
people see Nicaragua as a similar 
case, they do not want 10 be 
Involved in another war.

"What will happen to the WllIras when they fi nally lose?" - Hallin . 

If the United States invades 
Nicaragua, the Rcagan 
Adm inistration realizes they wlil 
not be involved in just a (WO or 
three day war. They know that 
thiS will bc an unpopular war 
both In Congress and with the 
Amencan people, and that it will 
be a vet)' long and bloody one. 
But Reagan very much wants this 
war, and that's why I think its 
veT)' Important at this time for 
the Amencan public to voice 
their disagreement with thi 
policy. This is also why I think 
that condemnation of this rype 
of poli cy around campuses is 
very important. 
Hallin: I would agree that there 
is no doubt that Reagan would 
send troops if he thought there 
was publi SUppOTt. 
Foroohar: I think that it would 
be very similar to Vietnam if the 
Uni ted States sent troops

Nicaragua but the whole Central

Nicaragua that means they will

people . They'll aL'io be using their 
adVisors in Costa Rica and EI 
alvador whi h means they'll be 

involvi ng the confli cting forces 
in those countries. Moreover. by 
invading Central Ameri ca, they 
will be involving all of Latin 
America. If they do so, they will 
radically change the political 
relations between the United 
States and the Latin American 
nations for years to come. 
Hallin: If the United States was 
to win in Nicaragua. the 
government that would end up

Chilean style IChile is currently

dictatorship) , and what that 
would mean is that they would 
have a funher cycle of this down 
the road. People , like Assistant 
Secretary of Sta te for Latin 
American Affairs Elliot! Abrams, 
Imagine that if the contras were 
to win that they would set up a 
democratic government, but 
that's very unlikely. Although the 
co ntras are deeply divided, they 
are basically dominated by ex-
national guardsmen from the old 
Somoza regime. Also, in a 
situation where one takes power 
by committing civil war and via 
the means of a foreign invasion, 
the regime that will come out of 
it is sure to be of the 
authori tarian nature. What that 
sets up is just another cycle of 
revolution, and the 
revolutionaries will be no more 
friendly to the United States, if 
not less so, than the Sandinistas 
are now. 
Foroohar There is no way that 
the element in power today in 

icaragua is goi ng to make it 
easy for the United States 10 
ove rthrow it rapidly, like it did 
to Allende's government in Chile. 
Allende never really armed the 
Chilean people so that they 
could resist a coup by the 
military when the time came to 
do so. It is a completely different 
situation in Nicaragua. The 
people have a very high level of 
social awareness; they are armed 
and they arc trained . If the 
United States did invade they 
might be able to control the 
major cities but they will not be 

able to control the counttyside. 
and will be fighti ng along gue rilla 
war. The Sandinistas fought the 
Somoza tyranny for 20 years 
without the support of popular 
organizations who were trained 
to assist them. Now they have 
almost the entire populace 
behind them. 
Guardian: Why don't we go back 
and define for our audience who 
and what you perceive the make 
up of the contras and the 
Sandinistas to be . Will you talk 
briefly about the various political 
ideologies that make up both 
groups, and their respective 
histories? 
Hallin: Although the contras are 
made up of various types of 
people, it is the military 
organization that controls the 
show and their leadership is 
comprised of ex-Somozistas, 
regardless of what type of 
poli tical structure they have set ' 
up. The political arm is made up 
mostly of disgruntled business 
people, and if you read the 
papers, recently there are a lot of 
divisions between them. The 
press usuaUy labels them as 
moderates, although that is a 
questionable label. The civilian 
leade rs are presently angry 
because it is the military leaders 
of the FDN (the largest contra 
fighting force) who are calling 
the shots, and I think that the 
civilian leadership knows that 
this will be the case if they 
should retake power. 

Before I discuss who the 
Sandinistas are , I want to say 
thal I think that one of the most 
important things to understand 
about Nicaragua is that U.S. 
intervention has exace.rbated the 
contradictions in thar society. So 
the Sandinista government has 

become inc reaSingly more hard-
line in regards 10 domestic 
opposition . moving away from 
the pluralism that characterized 
the revolution in the earlier 
period. I think this is an 
intended result of the Reagan 
Administration's policy. 

What will happen in the long 
run with the Nicaraguan 
revolution , I'm not quite sure. 
The Sandinistas have always 
been a dive rse and fluid 
collection of political factions, 
believing in socialism of one sort 
or another, but having different 
ideas of what that will look like . 
They also have very different 
ideas about what the economy 
should look like, whether it 
should Stay mixed or be state-
run. One of the affectS of the 
Reagan policy has been to push 
the economy toward a more 
traditional Marxist-Leninist 
model. Whether that will stay the 
direction of the Sandinistas in 
the long-run , no one really 
knows. 

Nicaraguan society tochl)'? 
Foroohar. Out of UNO, I would 
say that a person like Alfonso 
Robelo, who, in 1977, was a 
member of the Commission for 
National Dialogue, was to 
negotiate a peaceful transfer of 
power from the Somoza regime 
to the rest of the private sector. 
This dialague completely 
excluded the Sandinistas and the 
rest of Nicaraguan society. Arturo 
Cruz was a member of a broad 
opposition front to Somoza that 
was formed a few years before 
his overthrow. But these people 
were only in opposition to 
Somoza because they wanted a 
share in the power of his regime 
and not because they cared 
about the Nicaraguan people. 
They never wanted any change 
in the social structure of 
Nicaragua , which was in direct

FEATURE& 

contradiction to the Sandinistas 
and the other forces in 
Nicaraguan society who 
participated in the revolution in 
order to rid itself of the 
repressive social structure. 

This recent event, Irangate or 
Contragate, shows how corrupt 
these people reaUy are, We don't 
even really know where aU this 
money that was transferred to 
the contras from the Iranian 
arms deal went. Is it in their 
personal banks accounts? 

In terms of the Sandinistas, 
since the 1960s you can tell , for 
example, by the writings of one 
of their leaders, Carlos Fonseca,

Continued from page 7 
the earthquake of 1972, and it 
began to include more of the 
middle-class and some of the 
progressive elements of the 
upper-class. Around that time the 
Sandinistas split up into three 
different groups. But the main 
group that finally led Nicaragua 
to its final victory was the 
T erccrista faction, wh ich was the 
least Marxist group among the 
three And they were pushing for 
alliances with middle- and 
upper-class groups. And when 
the Sandinistas became one 
single organization again it kept 
this pluralistic characteristi c. It is 
not a totally Marxist organization 
today. There are Marxist amongst 
the FSLN, there arc priests, 
bureaucra ts, private ector 
people, pluralists; In my point of 
view there isn't any defi ned 
ideology that can properly 
charaCterize the Sandini stas. 
Guardian: By the T ercerista 
group, do you mean President 
Daniel Ortega and his brother, 
the Minister of Defense 
Humberto Ortega? 
Foroohar. Yes, and it was the 
Ortegas who were accused of 
being non-Marxist by the other 
factions . Frankly, I think that 
right now the Nicaraguan 
experience is very democratic 
internally, is very open 
ideologically , and actually for me, 
the FSLN as an organization is a 
concrete case of democracy. We 
keep talking about democracy 
and then we complain that there 
are Marxists who are members of 
the FSLN. If you believe in 

democracy, why can\ MarXists 
be included , 
Guardian: What rype of 
per eption is the general publi c 
getting from the mass media in 
both television and in the 
written word? 
Hallin: Well. they're nor hearing 
th :1[ much these days from 
Central America. If-you read the 
major newspapers you will find 
something almost every day but 
if you watch television you will 
get almost nothing, It's really 
dropped out of the news for the 
most part , 

The coverage itself. although I 
don 't want to generalize as there 
is a different type of reporting in 
various media, all in all , has had 
a trend in the last cou ple of 
years for attention fOCUSi ng 
primarily on Nicaragua and not 
on EI Salvador; and for Nicaragua 
to be understood In tenns of 
either left or right -
communis m or anti-communism. 
And as you know, the Reagan 
Administration has been trying 
very hard for year5 to shift the 
way we look at Nicaragua to 
those terms. It hasn't totally 
succeeded, but that's certainly 
been the trend . The trend IS at 
its strongest on televiSIOn. I've 
noticed in the last few months 
that every time there's a story 
from Nicaragua , Dan Rather 
introduces it with a Iinle homeric 
epithet, usually to the effect of 
"Soviet-backed Nicaraguan 
government" or "Marxist-
Sandinista regime," and this 
really wasn't the case, say five 
years ago. At that time. the 
Nicaraguan situation was not 
painted in east-west terms. Also, 
I would emphasize that television 
reponing on Nicaragua takes the 
Reagan's Administration's view 

- that [he govemmem is 
repress ing people , and that it's 
tloing so because of Marxist 
ideology. 
Foroohar. Yes, I think the 
Reagan Administration has been 
very successful at enforcing its 
terminology o n the U.s. media, 
and everybody in the United 
States in terms of "Marxist 
regime" or in like tenns. 
Sometimes it seems to me that 
no maner how false a term or 
analysiS may be, [hat after one 
hears it repeatedly day after day, 
after a while you start believing it 
as a fact. In the case of 
Nicaragua, sometimes there arc 
things that arc reported for the 
first time and that everyone 
know it's suc h a bad lie. But 
they keep repeating it and 
repeating it. for example. the 
stories coming out of the U.S. 
medi a about the Nicaraguan 
government's repression of the 
church arc amazing. BaSically, 
they don't have any foundation 
in Nicamgua . But pcople will 
believe these stories because they 
have no other sources of 
information, and that is the main 
problem with getting information 
in the United tates. 
Hallin: Although it's importam to 
note that umil very recendy 
Reagan has been unsuccessful m 
convincll1g the American 
populace to move Congress to 
support hiS poliCies. 
Guardian: But isn't it also true 
that the American public doesn't 
know which side is which? 
Hallin: Yes, people are confused 
about the details of things, But I 
think they know who the contras 
are better than they do the 
Sandinistas. The contras clearly 
have a bad image . Reagan has 
succeeded in painting the

Sandmi tas as Marxist or 
Leninist , but he has never 
succeeded in painting the 
contras as (he founding fathers. 
In fact, once in a while you can 
still catch a TV news show 
exposing contra atrocities. And 
of course the currem scandal has 
talTed the contras image also , 
Guardian: Is this issue more 
important for students to get 
involved in than. say. U.S. policy 
in the Middle East or Africa, or 
ovie( policy in Eastern Europe, 

Tllc~day. February 17, 1987 9 
FEATURES 

and the whole plethora of issues 
that ASUCSD Council 
representatives sa id were JUSt as 
important to students as this 
one? Does this issue affect 
students to a greater degree? 
Hallin: Well, I think that U.s. 
policy in the Middle East is 
important and that U.s. policy in 
South Africa is importam, but I 
think that Central America ranks 
among the most imponam issues 
that (he U.5. faces. It's cenainly

In the second half, again 
playing WIth a team compo cd 
mostly of reselves, the Tritons 
continued to conven Hawk 
turnovers into points. Christian

students. brought a !urge crowd

After the game, the seniors

the Tritons lost the match 3·6, 6-2. Denise Sugi. Colleen Richey

teams around . Doubles was a different story 

UCsD is 2-3 at this point in 
the season, and they have played 
only one team in their division . 
A person can look at that in twO 
ways. orie being that the Tritons 
record is going to suffer if they 
keep that kind of schedule. The 
second IS that they are going to 
be tough later m the season. 
That philosophy is a lot like the 
one the LOUisville Cardinals use 
in College Basketball, and it has 
seemed to work prelly well for 
Louisville as well as UCsD. 

Two of the Tritons three 
matches came from Chnstine 
Behrens. She staned the day 
winning a tough singles match 7-
6. 6·2 and then teamed with 
Rhonda Meier to win their

though . The emire match could 
have gone either way. Calhoun 
teamed with Richie and sugi 
with Camey as each team took 
their Santa Clara opponents to 
three sets before losi ng. 

The Tritons will take on U5D 
on Tuesday. yet another Division 
I team . and then its 
predominantly Division III 
schedule which will be welcomed 
by the players. ~
