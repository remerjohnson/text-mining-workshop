Clinllm will nol do the responsihlc Ihing

Article Ex .. erat_ 
China'. Power 
Editor: 

I'm writing to comment on 
BnKlk Garrellson's anicle "U.S. 
Over-Favors China" (G'I/mlill/l. 
Dec. .l. IIJIJK). Grant~d, 
Garr~lIson 's an ide was an opinion 
wlullln, and so should perhaps ~ 
expel:ted to have hias. hut I think 
the assertions /ilUnd therein arc 
ridkulously unhalanced. 

The UCSD Guardian 

My lirst point of contention is 
with the IL .. senion that the S-III 
Satan is "the most destructive 
Imissilel known to man." That 
kind of rhetoric i~ meaningless: no 
mailer what the missile type is. the 
payload is what is ocstructive (a 
nudear warhead). The statement 
hrings to mind Matements made 
during the Cold War that somehow 
Ameril:an missiles were "gIKJd" 
and Soviet missiles were evil. In 
fal:t, the tone of the article ha. .. the 
slant of those Charlton Heston 
narrolted documentaries that were 
pnJduced during th~ 'Klls Reagan 
era, those !:lems whil.:h lllUted the 
overwhehning numher of Soviet 

"orl:~s. how they had many more 
missiles and ships than we did, 
etc., ~tc. 

The author warns ominously 
that Chinese mi~siles arc "ailllL'tI at 
I J of llUr most populate<.! citi,,'S." 
and that "China's navy al(mc is 
mughly thn.'C times the sil.e of the 
Unit,,'tI States Navy." lime lilr a 
reality c~'\:k. First of all. let's com-
pare the amount of nuclear weapons 
China has to the anlllUnt the U.S. 
JlIISseSseS. China: 42~. US: 14.766. 

(SllUre~: ''''/1:111,'1\'1\:,'/1/1. ('(I/II1SP£-
CIALSkoltl.II'ClI!".I]/('ri('I/(·e/IIII'.IH/ 
IIIM/r/ll(/.I·IIII'IIt/). 

'As far as navi~s gil, a (juick 
perusal Ill' any Ill' the Janes I.:ata-
lugs. which list the /leets uf vari-
uus natillns. will shllw that cllm-
paring China's navy til that uf the 
United States by merely counting 
numhers of ships is ridiculous. 

Therc is nothing in China's navy 
10 rival a 6IlK fast attack subma-
rine. a TrKk.'Ilt submarine. or our 
nuclear powered carriers. 

On~ last point un which I 
hclieve a reality ch~'\:k is necessary 
is the author's comments re!:lard-
ing the American Missile Delense 
act. "the most imponant defcnse 
issue facing the United States." 

First, if a temlrist wcaJll'" of 
mIL~s dcstructilm is hcadt.>d our 
way, I helieve it is lar more likely

One valid argument is that. 
despite his llawcd characler. 
President Clinton gels the job done, 
A good example of this is his recent 
pa. .. sing of balanced-budget legisla-

Clinton. however. makes a case 
against this argument when he dis-
regards the good of America. 
remaining in onice when his mis-
takes will distract those on Capilol

PrcsicJent Clinton manages to 
"do the wort of the American pe0-
ple" while juggling scandals and 
lawsuits. His impeachment add ... 
perhaps. one too many balls to his 
act. Facing months of testimony and

Ranked in the top 10 of Division III ha~­

If they can win their second home tourna-
ment of the year, Coal:h Lanthier's senior-
laden squad seems primed for a good show-
ing in the NCAA playoffs in March.
