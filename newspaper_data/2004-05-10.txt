Intruders break into 
UCSD computer network 

Exposed data include personal 
records, social security numbers 

By SHANNON ELlOJ 
Staff Writer 

pproxiOiatcly 3 0,000 people 
are being notified by C 0 of an 
unauthorized break-in of four com-
puters in the UC D Bu ine and 
Financial ervice Oeparnnent. 
The computers cont3in personal 
record such as name , ocial ecu-
rity nu~bers and drivers' license 
information of C D faculty, taff 
and tudents, a well a those who 
applied for admi ion to CSD but 
never enrolled. Notification letter 
were mailed on May 5 to those who 
.rught have been affected and will 
continue to be sent for several 
weeks. 

"We deeply regret that unau-
thorized intruders have broken into 
one of our computer networks, 
possibly compro.rusing the person-
al information of students, staff, 
faculty and others," UCSD 
Controller Don Larson st3ted in a 
press release. "Our main concern at 
this point is to inform people 
whose private intormation has been' 
exposed by this illegal intrusion, 
provide them guidance on what 
steps they can take to protect them-
selves from potential identity theft, 

and 31 0 to a sure them that we 
have taken trong and immediate 
tep ' to bolster our defenses again t 

any future attacks." 
Although y terns administra-

tor have evidence of an intrusion, 
there is no evidence that the per-
onal record were acce sed. Due 

to the, fact that many expo ed 
record did not include contact 
information, UC 0 has joined 
with the California Department of 
Motor Vehicle and the U .. Po tal 
ervice to obtain contact informa-

tion of potential victims. 
The April 16 incident involved 

the unauthorized access of two 
computers via the Internet. Upon 
discovering the security breach, 
ad.runistrators removed the affect-
ed computers from the university 
network and carried out an emer-
gency assessment of all network 
stations. It was found that two 
additional computers containing 
personal data had also been infil-
trated. 

A campuswide security task 
force is being assembled to deter-
mine what measures need to be 
taken to make UCSD secure

BAC switches to new 
Student Center design 

By .RYAN lSAO 
Associate News Editor 

The Building Advisory 
Committee voted in favor of a 
new design for Student Center 
expansion on May 7 that would 
demolish one current building 
and could move the General 
Store to the west side of the com-
plex. Citing reasons of improved 
traffic flow and better sunlight, 
the committee voted for Scheme 
A over Scheme B, despite 
demonstrating strong interest in 
Scheme B in the previous meet-
ing. Scheme II, the original 
favorite, was voted down. T he 
final vote was seven in favor of 
Scheme A, six in favor of Scheme 

B and three in favor of Scheme n. 
Scheme A features the demo-

lition of the building that cur-
rently houses the Food Co-op, 
the General Store and the offices 
located above them and the con-
struction of a new building run-
ning from east to west next to 
Grove Caffe. By demolishing the 
building, which currently sits in 
the center of Student Center, the 
architects hope to increase pedes-
trian traffic through Student 
Center. Sunlight analyses also 
showed less shadows in Scheme A 
than in Scheme B.

UCSD receives additional 
funding for bomb simulator 

Jacobs School of Engineering received a 
new $4.4 million contract for a bomb blast 
simulator from the federal government on 
May 5. In.:luding the new contract, the feder-
al government has committed $8.6 million to 
the school's Explosive Loading Laboratory 
Testing Program. 

The simulator is supported by the Technical 
Support Working Group, which is the federal 
interagency organization for combating terror-
ism. This contract brings TSWG's total financial 
support to $8.6 million. 

The simulator would be the world's first 
laboratory designed to study the effects of 
bomb blasts without actually detonating explo-
sives. Researchers at UCSD are currently 
applying earthquake retrofit techniques to 
bomb-proof buildings. Several embassies and 
military facilities have already been outfitted 
with technology developed by UCSD 
researchers. 

Construction of the facility is expected to be 
completed by the end_ of 2004. The facility is 
expected to open in 2005. 

Davidow to speak on 
Mexican/American relations 

Institute of Amerita's di rector Jeffrey 
Davidow will discuss his new book, "The u.s. 
and MeXICO: The Bear and the Porcupine", at 
4 p.m. on May 11 at the Faculty Club. His 
book examines the forces bringing the two 
countries closer together and those impeding 
cooperation, which he argues include the 
nations' presidents, drug trafficking across the 
Mexican border and u.s. immigration poli-
cies. 

Davidow has previously served as the U.s. 
ambassador to Mexico and assistant secretary 
of state for Latin America. When he retired 

from the State Department in 2003, Davidow 
was America's hiRhest-ranking diplomat and 
one of only three oiplomats to hold the rank of

Researchers develop gene 
computational mOdel 

Researchers at UCSD, led by bioengi-
neering professor Bernhard Palsson and 
alumnus Markus Covert, have created the 
first ever genome·scale computational 
model of the gene regulatory system of the 
E. coli bacterium. The computational model 
helps define the way genes are expressed in 
E. col i cells and the way they affect the cell's 
functions. 

The team's results were published in the 
May 6 issue of Nature. 

Researchers created the model by run-
ning a series of experiments involving E. coli 's 
reaction oxygen deprivation. The team creat-
ed a model that predicted the results of 
experiments run on E. col i, both with and 
without oxygen, then updated their model 
when their predictions were incorrect. The 
model can now be used to design better 
experiments, i nt~rpret experimental re,ults 
on E. coli, and engineer better strains of E. 
coli. 

UCSD has filed a patent on the model and 
is negotiating a licensing agreement In addi-
tion to developing the E. coli model, Palsson's 
research group is also beginning work on a reg· 
ulatory model of yeast, a single-celled organ-
ism which is more closely related to human 
cells.

Judicial Board rules in favor of 
A.S. in DJ club's complaint 

By MARNETTE FEDEIIS 
Associate News Editor 

The A.S. Judicial Board ruled 
in favor of Associated Studenrs in 
the complaints made by the DJs 
and Vinylphiles Club for breach of 
contract on May 3. The board also 
found that Associated Students 
was not liable for damages the 
club incurred resulting from AS. 
officers canceling the perfor-
mance of the club's DJs during the 
All-Campus Spring Dance held 
on April 2. However, the board 
also ruled that Associated 
Students should create a policy 
that gives two to three days warn-
ing for cancellations and write a 
lener of apology to the DVe. 

DVC Vice President Victor 
Chiu said that he was not sur-
prised by the decision. 

"Going up against A.S. really is 
analogous to going up against 
some giant corporation - it's 
never an easy task by any stan-
danis," Chiu said. "'However, we 
are pleased in that we achieved 
what we originally set out to do, 
that is, to protect all the future 
clients of A.S., primarily student 
organizations, from being take 
adva ntage of." 

A.S_ Commi sioner of Student 
Advocacy Jeff Boyd, who repre-
sented Associated Students during 
the heari ng, said that the organi-
zation was already planning on 
writing an apology and that he 
agreed wi th the results of the 
hearing. 

"I thought it was a good deci-
sion," Boyd sa id. "I agree with the 
position the board took ... 1 thinK 
that when planning future event , 
we need to discuss issue like rain 
and what ha ppens if the event gets 

canceled." 
During the hearing, Chiu 

charged that fonner Sinh College 
Sophomore Senator Mike 
Dawson breached a verbal con-
tract that would have allowed the 
club into the all-campus dance 
program in ClIchange for promo-
tions through flyers and other 
forms of advertising. The club 
DJs were slated to perfonn at 
Ballroom A and B. However, due 
to rain, organizers decided to 
have only one dance floor at the 
ballroom location, causing the 
DVC to be pushed out of the pro-
gram. 

"We found that some of the 
promotions were not as 
promised," Chiu said. "One of the 
speci fics was the cloth banner up 
in Price Center. We had elucidated 
in conversation that the logo and 
the DVC name would be put on 
the banner, but it was not present." 

The board concluded in its 
decision that the advertising pro-
vided by Associated Students for 
the dance was appropriate because 
it contained names of sponsors 
including the DVC logo accord-
ing to the original agreement. 
The board also found that the 
cloth banners, which "had no 
organization labels," were not 
under the control of the A.S. 
Council . 

Boyd said during the hearing 
that while it was unfortunate that 
the DVC was pushed out, it was 
necessary due to concerns of lim' 
ited capacity. 

"The A.S. carried its end of the 
bargain. We offered free advertis-
ing over all the advertising that 
Mike Dawson had control of," 
Boyd said during his closing state-
ments. 

The DVC also filed complaints 
against Associated Students 
charging unprofessional conduct 
by Dawson and sought compensa-
tion for associated damages relat-
ed to the cancellation of the club's 
show through a full-page ad in the 
UCSD GUlI1'IJiIlfl. Chiu said that • 
some of the DJs incurred travel 
expenses driving from the Los 
Angeles area and one of the DJs 
had created a special record 
specifically for the dance. 

However, the board decision 
stated that the DJ selection and 
equipment costs were "left to the 
DVC's discretion and were not 
included in the verbal agree-
ments" between the club and 
Associated Students. 

During the hearing, Chiu said 
that Dawson was supposed to call 
him in the afternoon of April 2 to 
inform him of the decision on 
whether the DVC performances 
would be canceled. Chiu said that 
he never received a call from 
Dawson to inform him of a deci-
sion. 

"We believe that an extension 
of [the canceled event] was the 
weather, but it is the responsibil-
ity of the creator of the party to 
be informed of possible things 
tlut could happen and inform 
services that have gathered to 
inform them of cancellation," 
Chiu said. 

According to the board , its 
decision recognizes that both 
parties should ha ve had greater 
communication to prevent confu-
sion on April 2. The decision also 
stated that while Associa ted 
Students could have checked 
weather condition in advance,

Quarterly: First online issue 
features biology research 
continued from page I 

current online version features 
original research articles wrinen 
and reviewed by undergraduates. 

According to its editors, the 
creation of an undergraduate 
research journal at UCSD follows 
developments at Harvard, UC 
Berk.eley and a host of other uni-
versities that have recently intro-
duced new venues to recognize the 
contributions of student research 
projects to the growing corpus of 
academic knowledge. The Sillmum 
QuIIrttr/y, however, focuses exclu-
sively on biological sciences 
research. 

The first issue of the journal 
includes four reviews and three 
original articles ranging from 
gene therapy to geriatrics with a 
strong showing from the neuro-
sciences. 

Editors said they were pleased 
with the number of submissions, 
which were solicited from UCSD 
undergraduates working in biolo-
gy-related fields or other under-
graduates working in labs associat-
ed with UCSD. 

Editors said they hope the 
Silltman Qrumer/y will provide a 
new outlet for students. 

"A lot of people don't have 
enough [material] for Proceedings of 
tht Nlltirmlll AClldmry of Scimus or 
Nature but have enough to tell a 
story," said Louis Nguyen, co-edi-
tor in chief of the Salwall 
QUllrterly. "They're often not given 
the meri t they deserve for their 
work." 

U ndergraduate student Jennifer 
Hsieh, lead author of one of the 
original research papers, said she 
wanted to share the results of her 
study, fu nded by the American 
Heart Association, with her class-
mates before graduati ng. In the 

Saltman Quarterly, she published 
her findings that age and nicotine 
intake affect systolic blood pres-
sure independently from exercise 
level and calcium intake. 

The paper's editors hope to 
continue receiving strong submis-
sions from undergraduates pursu-
ing academic research. 

Co-editor in chief Marika OrJov 
said she hopes the journal will soon 
be searchable via PubMed, the 
National Library of Medicine's 
search service. 

" [Broader recognition[ would 
validate our work, n OrJov said. 

The difficulty for the editorial 
board, Orlov said, lies in harmoniz-
ing a desire to include as many 
undergraduate research projects as 
possible while maintaining high 
standards of publ ication in the 
journal. 

"We have to find a balance on a 
case-by-case basis," OrJov said. 

The editors require that the stu-
dent-authors principal investigator 
review and approve the submission 
before it IS accepted. Accordi ng to 
Gregory Emmanuel, the third co-
editor in chief, this ensures a level of 
excellence in research. 

T he paper is named after Paul 
Salonan, who taught biology to 
UCSD undergraduates before his 
death in 1999. Saltman started the 
biology teaching assistant pro-
gra m and involved students in 
worki ng on- projects funded by his 
endowment of the department of 
biological sciences. The publica-
tion derives all its funding from 
this endowment via the depart-
ment.

San Diegans must preserve sale 
remaining habitat for seals 

By CHRIS TAYLOR 
Senior Staff Writer 

Toward the end of the film "The Matrix," Agent Smith describes a rev-elation to Morpheus that he believes 
humans are a disease. He argues that mam-
mals adapt to their environment, whereas 
humans change their environment to suit 
them, and once resources are depleted, they 
move on - much like a virus. 

This revelation is a bit of an exaggeration 
and the connotation is clearly negative. 
However, there is definite truth in the com-
parison. Humans are incredibly adept at 
changing the environment to 
suit their fancy, even at the 

San Diego. 
Legally, argues attorney Paul Kennerson, 

the beach must be returned to human use, 
because of the 1931 precedent. This prece-
dent, however, should not trump the fact 
that the seals are protected by the 1972 
Marine Mammal Protection Act, which pro-
hibits interference with the narural behavior 
of marine mammals. An 80-year-old state 
gift should not be considered more valid 
than the protection of an endangered 
sjlCcies, especially given the human use of so 
lOany San Diego beaches. 

Swimmers argue that humans and seals 
can easily share the beach. However, most 

biologists and naturalists agree 
that this will result in the harass-

complete expense of the local ' 
animal inha bitants. 

This revelation is quite-
starkly played out on a local 
level. A group of La Jolla resi-
dents is attempting to re-open 

PRO 
ment of the seals, which pro-
motes displacement. In fact, any-
one who visits the beach at night 
to watch the seals will routinely 
see teenage boys trying to 

the Children's Pool, where 
anywhere between 50 to 200 
seals currently reside, for human swimming. 
A taskforce has been established [0 research 
the consequences of human swimming and 
sub equent seal displacement at the Pool. 

As its name implies, the Children's Pool 
was a gift from the state to the children of 
San Diego in 193 I. It has been closed on 
and off for human use because of the large 
influx of harbor seals that rest there. Since 
last year, there has been limited use of the 
beach by divers and swimmers, bur officially 
the beach remains closed. Swimmers may be 
cited and fined up to $1,000 should they vio-
late that policy. 

Why the people of La Jolla evcn care 
about yet another swimming area is baffling, 
especially at the expense of one of the few 
government-protected seal habitations in 

impress their girlfriends by 
harassing the seals. 

Swimmers also may be at risk. 
While generally docile, the seals do become 
defensive at times, especially during mating 
and birthing seasons. The seals are slow on 
land, but should someone provoke them 
while swimming, the seals could inflict a 
great amount of injury, to the point of 
drowning the swimmer. 

In a perfect display of poetic justice, nine 
La J ollan protesters decided to swim in the 
beach to protest the policy during a seal 
birthing season. Their activity panicked the 
seals, who stormed into the sea and injured 
several of the swimmers. 

Biologists have come together to ask that 
human interference be completely removed, 
as it always affects the seals negatively.

Humans built Children's Pool 
for children, not seals 

By ISlA YAGHOUBI 
Staff Writer 

With coverage from National Geographic and The New York TI1IItS, La Jolla's debate over pre-
serving one of its most popular beaches for 
public use or surrendering to an expanding 
harbor seal population is obviously not some 
silly whale of a tale. It is illustrative of a 
greater debate involving issues of human 
versus animal needs, the sheltering of a 
species versus their expansion in "natural" 
habitats. 

The contentious area is the Children's 
Pool near La Jolla Cove, within 

humans the chance to enjoy the ocean water 
without risking their lives. Seal pups, being 
sea manunals, don't have to worry as much 
about the drowning risk. . 

The California Coastal Commission and 
the community of La Jolla magnanimously 
declared Seal Rock and nearby rocky out-
croppings a reserve in 1994, clearly taking 
into account the needs of seals and sea lions. 
It just so happens that these mammals have 
been multiplying rapidly through the years. 
As they prefer areas of easy entry ,lOd exit, 
the beach at the Children's Pool is where 
they began to congregate to rest, which they 
now do regularly in the fall, winter and 

spring. 
walking distance of downtown 
La Jolla's upscale beach commu-
nity of eateries, boutiques, gal-
leries and hotels, with grassy 
park areas situated nearby. (ON There was an effon to split the beach between seals and people, but the policy of shared use proved dangerous when routine water testing by the 

county Health Department The government, under the 
1972 Marine Mammal 
Protection Act, made it a viola-
:ion of federal law to interfere in 
any way with the narural behavior of marine 
mammals. This sort of blanket endorsement 
does not take into account the "natural" 
behavior of mammals in not-so-narural sur-
roundings. 

The Children's Pool is not quite "natur-
al" - it has a sea wall that was constructed in 
1931, thanks to the charity of Ellen B. 
Scripps, and was intended for use by people. 
The specific goal was to make a sheltered 
beach area for children where the force of 
the waves would be broken. This area was 
intended to be a protected area where chil-
dren could swim and be safe from strong 
currents, hence the name - Children's Pool. 
All animal species can have children, not 
excluding seal pups, but the fact is that this 
specific site was designated to give young 

identified unhealthy levels of 
bacteria. Ensuing DNA tests 
confidently linked the conta-

gion to seal feces. Since September 1997, the 
Children's Pool has been closed to human 
use. The seals that come out to rest are wild 
and, like all wild animals, are unpredictable 
and can suddenly become hostile. These 
mammals have sharp teeth and could easily 
bite, especially if cornered and bothered. 

Some claim t1ut the marine marrunal show 
with seals and sea lions splashing in the water 
serves as a popular tourist attraction, but the 
only thing a tourist can do is simply look at 
the playful pinnipedia. Perhaps this could be 
considered exhilarating for the span of a 
whopping five to ten minutes were it not for 
the stench of seal excrement and pollutants. 
Tourists would probably be better served if

Chris Taylor 

I t should have been no surprise that the most poignant and 
refreshing critique of the A.S. 

Council this year would be accom-
plished by the master of grandstand-
ing and controversy, Bryan Barton. 
Whether he knew it or not, Barton's 
attempted ruup tJ'rtill of the A.S. 
Council May 5 revealed a great 
number of useful insights into the 
SttUcture and attitude of the A.S. 
Council. 

For those who missed a great 
opportunity to see the creativity of 
college students, should they choose 
to use it productively, the events 
went as follows: Bryan Barton deliv-
ered a speech to the A.S. Council 
during the time aUoted for public 
input. While he spoke, a goat was 
brought into the chamber to high-
light Barton's point that the A.S 
Council could be better run by .an 
ungulate. The goat was followed by 
a number of masked srudents who 
marched into Price Center 
Ballroom and proceeded to stand in 
front of the elected officials. Banon 
informed.the council that it was, in 
fact, a coup and demanded that they 
leave. Upon their refusal, the 
masked students drenched the rep-

resentatives with WlIter pistols and 
water balloons before Oeeing. 

By itself, this event is the epito-
me of what college should be like. 
We at UCSD take ourselves too 
seriously, choosing to watch other 
college sNdents' crazed antics from 
afar or by WlItching Animal House 
late at night Barton's event was a 
small glimpse of what UCSD sru-
dent life might be like if we relaxed 
a bit. 

However, a much more pro-
found look at student government 
may be found by examining the A.S. 
Council's reaction to this prank. 

First of all, it should be said that 
most of the A.S. representatives did 
a fine job in reminding the srudent 
body that they are acrually college 
srudents and have a sense of humor. 
Because the politicking of the A.S. 
Council is often intense - perhaps 
because the stakes are so low - any-
one should be happy for a moment 
of anarchy amidst hours of boring 
resolutions and parliamentary pro-
cedure. 

However, it still goes to show 
that the A.S. Council continually 
takes itself too seriously. While it 
does have a great deal of money 
under its command, most of it is 
safely pre-appropriated (with one-
third of the budget allocated toward 
concerts) so that only relatively 
minor changes are generally made. 
Since nearly 80 percent of the sru-
dent body believes the A.S. Council 
to be so unimportant that they don't 
even vote, the council should not be 

terribly encouraged by its impor-
tance amongst srudents. 

Those students who didn't have 
the flexibility to laugh at Barton and 
themselves, most notably Daniel 
Gonzales, the A.S . Student 
Affirmative Action Committee rep-
resentative, also show great insight 
into the mind of the A.S. Council. 
Gonzales said that this "kind of 
intimidatior." really bothers him and 
that "people literally felt unsafe." It 

" '" a goat was brought 
into the chamber to 

highlight Barton's point 
that the A. S. COUTlCil 

could be better run by an 
ungulate. " 

is ironic that the SAAC representa-
tive, who has whined in the past 
about feeling "unsafe" on campus, 
says he feels intimidated by the 
lanky and altogether laughable 
Barton and his water-wielding fol-
lowers. 

Harish Nandagopal, the A.S. 
presidential candidate for Srudents 
First! during the last election, 
claimed that his slate was filled only 
by progressive srudents - who now 
dominate the A.S. council, although 
Harish himself lost. Barton's display 

brings to light an interesting defini-
tion of progressive. A student who is 
progressive should not be afraid of 
change, should be open-minded and 
should be able to explore all possi-
bilities to alternative ideas. By this 
definition, Harish clearly was wrong 
about several of his fellow candi-
dates who cannot relax enough to 
enjoy a college prank. 

Even more so, representatives 
like Gonz.ales show rather conclu-
sively that the Associated Srudents is 
not a progressive institution, but 
rather a stagnant status quo. It is 
true that, politically, this status quo 
lies far to the left of the current 
national establishment, but it is a 
status quo nonetheless. There is 
intense resistance to change and the 
sense of self-importance is often so 
high that any disruption of the ritu-
alistic nonn is a violation of all that 
is holy. 

Srudents First! itself is a stagnant 
form of assuring the A.S. election 
victories and the slate elected 
change nothing from year to year, 
because, like any establishmem 
would say, they "stid< with what 
works." 

Finally, Gonzales complained 
that this event might "delegit-

imi~e" the A.S. Council with stu-
dent public opinion. I'd like to 
point out that Mr. Gonzales is 
seriously deluded if he believes 
that the A.S. Council currently 
has any legitimacy with the stu-
dents at all. This statement proves 
that, often, the A.S. Council's 

mentaliry is that the students 
thmk they are actual politicians 
and officials. 

The A.S. Council is severely iso-
lated from the student body whether 
it wishes to be or not. Admitterlly, it 
may not even be the council's fault. 
UCSD students are renowned for 
their ability to remain apa thetic 
even in the most exciting of events. 
But to assume that Barron's prank is 
somehow going to lower the A.S. 
COlUlcil's reputation in the mind of 
the students is not only misguided, 
but it's actually rather arrogant. 

But in the end, while there are 
always a few ~tudents willing to fight 
for dhe status quo, this author 
applauds most of the A.S. coun-
cilmembers for their willingness to 
laugh at themselves and give them-
selves relief from the temple-pound-
ing monotony that is ofren the A.S. 
COlUlcil. 

And while I will be surpnsed if 
Bryan Barton doe n't get himself 
drop-kicked Ollt of this campu 
before graduation, one has to tep 
back and appreciate the people 
who, for whatever motivation, take 
us all back ro the level where we 
remember that we don 't maner. 
There i great comfort in this and 
A.S. councilmembers would ha\'e a 
lot more fun if they more often 
realized thi .

6 OPINION THE UCSD OUARDIAN 

~ I LEnERS TO THE EDITOR 
Use o~ an~-plali~rism 

semce IS Justified 
to substantiate such a claim. 
Instead, he most likely relies on 
anecdotal 

been a far more sophisticated 
process for dealing with suspected 

cases than indicated in 
the story. Each case of 
possible plagiarism, 

that explanation is taken into 
account. It is only the cases where 
the student clearly plagiarized or 
otherwise cheated on his work that 
are forwarded to the dean's office 
for administrative action. The stu-
dent's TA or the MMW staff deal 
with most cases of possible plagia-
rism. If it is an "honest mistake" or 
where there is doubt about 
whether the student cheated, the 
most common response is a warn-
ing, possibly including a grade 
reduction on that assignment, 
depending on the severity of the 
infraction. 

Editor: 
I was rather amused to see A.S. 

information 
and disgrun-
tled cheaters 
who were 
caught but 
refuse to admit 
they are guilty. 

As a teach-
ing assistant 
for the MMW

the past four 
years, J can 
assure you that

whether identified by 
Turnitin.com or by 
the student's TA, goes 
through multiple 
reviews. The TA does 
the original check, 
and forwards suspi-
cious cases to the aca-
demic coordinator. 
The student's work is 
then carefully exam-
ined against the evi-
dence of plagiarism or 
other academic mis-
conduct. At this point, 

Commissioner of Student 
Advocacy Jeff Boyd quoted as say-
ing, "The problem is that ERC has 
a zero rolerance policy on cheat-
ing," in a story ("ERC records 46 
percent of plagiarism cases," April 
26) on Eleanor Roosevelt 
College's use of Turnitin .co~. It 
seems ro me that the problem is 
really that the students are cheat-
ing. I have to wonder what level of 
tolerance for cheating Mr. Boyd 
thinks would be appropriate? 
Perhaps it is now socially accept-
able behavior, and I am just an 
anachronism. 

What the article thoroughly 
de/nonstrates is that Mr. Boyd 
does not understand how ERC 
handl es suspected plagiarism 
cases. I Ie is quoted as saying, "I 
think there were a lot of cases that 
were prosecuted unfairly." I would 
li ke to kn ow where he gets the 
data on which he bases this asser-
tion. Since he is not an employee 
of the Making of the Modern 
\Vorlll prog ram, he lacks acces to 
the records that would allow him

catching plagiarism, there has 

the student is also 
given a chance to explain why 
there is evidence he cheated, and 

As for the other concerns, priva-
cy is not an issue since the student 
does not need to use their actual 
name or ill number when submit-
ting a paper. If using a pseudonym, 
all they need to do is notify their 
TA what name they used. The idea 
that intellectual property rights are 
at stake is laughable. The only 
value any of these papers have as 
intellectual property is if the stu-
dents sell them to other students. 
But then, the problem is not the 
cheating; it is enforcing rules 
against cheating, right?

Pro: Humans 
have plenty of 
other beaches 

to use 
continl«!d from page of 

Humans are notoriously bad at 
intencting with species that cannot 
apdy protect themselves. La Jolla 
teenagers should be reason enough 
to close the beach to humans 
entirely, much less ignorant swim-
ming protesters. Magnify this to 
opening the beach to the general 
public, wherein it will begin to look 
like La Jolla Shores on a hot day, 
and the seals will surely be forced 
to leave. 

Of course, the abundance of 
seals on so small 3 beach has led to 
ecological problems. There is a 
dangerous level of bacteria in that 
area which has been verified as 
the result of seal feces. However, 
these problems have nothing to 
do with human swimming and 
should further deter humans from 
trying to open the beach to their 
own use. 

Swimmer argue that the 
beach may be dredged and 
cleaned. While that may even be 
necessary for the seals' livelihood, 
it is also very disruptive . Even 
though the beach is contaminated 
enough to prohibit human activi-
ty anyway, these swimmers wish 
further disruption of the seal 
habitat to make it clean for human 
use. 

All this underlies the obvious 
argument that there is no reason to 
open another beach for human usc. 
This would be true of any area of 
California's disappearing coastline. 
These proceedings are particularly 
menacing because the opening of 
this beach would destroy one of the 
last few seal preserves. 

In the long history of humans 
determining whether they or local 
wildlife should have rights to the 
land, the animals are rarely victori-
ous. It should not be such a difficult 
task to set aside one small area that 
is beyond our use.

they were afforded the opportunity 
to enjoy a hands-on, intenctive 
experience with nature - sans seals 
- especially in a healthy and safe 
environment for their chili:lren. In 
addition, the state granted the beach 
to the city in 1931 to be devoted 
exclusively to children and recre-
ational use. Hence, the Children's 
Pool beach became a popular spot 
for scuba divers because of the reek 
just offshore. The scuba divers were 
precluded from use of the Seal Rock 
reserve set aside for the marine 
mammals, also just offshore, but 
they did have access to the 
Children's Pool beach. That is no 
longer the case. 

At the mouth of the small down-
town La Jolla harbor, in an area 
long ago reserved and structured 
for children, wild seals and sea lions 
are contaminating and posing an 
environmental (and perhaps physi-
cal) threat. The issue has been in 
debate for many years, and the San 
Diego City Council will continue 
this as it has made plans to discuss 
proposals regarding the issue this 
summer. There is little need to 
debate this much further - the sea 
mammals deserve protection, but 
nOt when it involves creatill8 an 
unnatunl habitat It the expense of 
people's health. safety and recre-
ltion.

Jim Brown, an architect with the 
firm Public, said during his pre-
sentation. "[It) provides all pro-
gram elements with a front door

Scheme B would have pre-
served the current structure of 
Student Center without demolish-
ing the Food Co-op building, bur 
would have replaced the General 
Store with a 1,500-square-foot 
student lounge, featuring Ooor-to-

light and visibility. However, sun-
light analyses showed significantly 
increased shadows in Scheme B, 
and many committee members 
expressed an interest in creating 
more open space with a courtyard. 
Scheme II was vety similar to 
Scheme A, but would have placed 
the General Store in the southeast 
corner of Student Center instead 
of the west side. 

According to the architects' 
estimates, Scheme B would also 
cost S310,000 less than Scheme A, 

and $600,000 less than the origi-
nally proposed Scheme []. Some 
committee members felt that the 
reduced cost would protect 
against future cost overruns and

others felt that the funding could 
be used to incorporate more stu-
dent groups into Student Center. 

According to building regula-
tions, Student Center cannot be 
expanded by more than 4,507 
square feet. According to Brown. 
however, exceptions to the expan-
sion cap have been obtained in the 
past. If an exception were 
obtained, the additional S31O,000 
could be used to build an addi-

tional 680 square feet of interior 
space in Student Center. 

"We've already gotten many, 
many requests [for space] - from 
A.S., from the commuter board, 
from the All-Campus Transfer 
Association and all these other 
programs that are really vital to 
this campus and would like to have 
space in the expansion," BAC Co-
chair Justin Williams said. "This is 
a reality we have to face . . . the 
$600,000 we're going to appreci-
ate a lot later down the road, 
because I guarantee there are 
going to be things that we won't 
be able to include." 

Nonetheless. committee mem-
bers felt that Scheme A more fully 
achieved the goals of the Student 
Center expansion . 

"If we keep the [Food Co-op)

However, the representatives 
did not see cuts to higher education 
as the best solution to the state's 
budget deficit. 

Kehoe said that the governor's 
proposed budget would break the 
commitment made in the Master 
Plan. 

"We believe that the [proposed 
budget] will talce a bad situation 
and malce it worse, much worse," 
Kehoe said. "This is a call to Iceep a 
promise that is essential to 
California's education promise and 
economic survival ." 

Alpert pointed out that while 
cuts to higher education are being 
made, the budget for California 
prisons has increased. 

"What a sad commentary on our 
priorities," Alper! said. "Budgets 
are a statement of the priorities of 
the ~iety. We are on our third 
round of huge increases and fees -
Ipublic university fees] are getting 
up to the COSt of private colleges."

Pledp: State Sen. Dede Alpert (D·San

Breach: UCSD to assemble campuswide 
security task force to protect networks 

California Sute Univer ity 
trustee Murray Galinson stated 
that there are currently 400,000 
students enrolled in the CSU sys-
tem and that enrollment is increas-
ing. According to Galinson, the 
state's community colleges, which 
will also face budgel cuts, cannot 
a bsorb the thousands of students 
who will be turned away from the 
CSU and UC systems. 

According to Angelides and 
other legislators, by do ing these 
loopholes, the $386 million of addi-
tional revenue could avert 
Schwarzenegger's budget proposal 
of eliminating all outreach pro-
grams, prevent nlll1ing away 21 ,000 
eligible students from enrolling at 
University of California and 
California State University, prevent 
the increase of California communi-
ty college fees by 44 percent, prevent 
reducing the eligibility of middle-
income students for Cal GrantS, 
avoid cutting UC research funding 
by 5 percent, and prevent raising 
UC and CSU graduate fees by 40 
percent. 

continued from page , 
against future cyber attacks. The 
breach is currently under investi-
gation by campus police and other 
law enforcement agencies. 

"[The investigation] has been 
ongoing since day one," Larson 
said. "We took the computers 
offline and now are working with 
campus security ellperts to find 
steps we can take to malee the 
system more secure and malce 
sure this doesn't happen again." 

Although it has been nearly a 
month since the system was infil-
trated, those sending letters to 
affected parties say that the wait 
was needed to straighten out the 
details of the incident. 

"We were trying to get a han-
dle on the problem. We didn't 
want to release a statement until 
we knew how big the problem 
was," said Director of Sttategic 
Communications Dolores' 
Davies. ·We decided to inform 
people when we knew about final 
figures and numbers. It would 
have been irresponsible to make 
a public statement before we 
knew exactly what was going 
on." 

Other universities have also 
recently been affected by similar 
problems. The University of 
Texas, New York University, and 

other California State University 
and UC campuses have had com-
puter securi ty systems that 
stored personal information 
breached. 

"Unfortunately, there are 
thousands of people out there 
every day attempting to do this," 
Larson said. 

Frank Dwyer, the associate 
director for information technolo-
gy at the San Diego 
Supercomputer Center, concurred. 

"Academia is known for its 
culture of openness, and the free 
sharing of information is part of 
that philosophy," Dwyer stated 
in a press release. "While these 
are clearly important qualities 
for an academic i nsti tution to 
have, universities now face the 
challenge of protecting vital data 
while preserving this culture of 
openness." 

Those who receive a notifica-
tion letter are encouraged to visit 
http://idaltrt.ucrd.tdu. The Web 
site includes a list of frequently 
asked questions and possible ways 
to protect oneself against identity 
theft. The university recommends 
that all individuals who have 
received the notice letter place a 
"fraud alert" on their credit card 
files. 

Revelle College junior 

Caroline Lindsay has followed the 
safety instructions. 

" I'm not sure there's really 
anything more I can do at this 
point besides report the theft and 
watch my credit report," Lindsay 
said. "I hope that UCSD has fixed 
this, because it's a pretty scary 
thing when someone can hade 
into the system ... It just makes 
you realize how vulnerable you 
are when everyone's identified by 
their credit card and social securi-
ty numbers." 

Revelle junior Jenny Kaser said 
she wasn't too worried . 

"If people with bad intentions 
get their hands on that informa-
tion, it can't be good. However, 
to me it seems like they were JUSt 
using the access for storage 
space and nothing more," she 
said. "The school has taken the 
necessary precautions to notify 
people and tell them what to do 
about it. I called the credit 
agency, and it was easy to set the 
fraud alert." 

For those individuals who do 
not receive a letter but are worried 
that they have been affected, a 
toll-free hotline has been set up by 
UCSD at (866) 890-5560. 
Information is also available at 
(858) 822-2830. E-mail can also 
be sent to idilkrtf!Jwsd.tdu. 

"To say that CSU has been 
severely impacted by budget cuts is 
one of the gross understatements 
of the year," Galinson said. "The 
state is being very shortsighted, 
since 85 percent of todays jobs 
require college degrees." 

Chancellor-designate of the San 
Diego Community College District 
Constance Carroll discussed the 
proposed budget cuts in regards to 
the current enrollment surge, stat-
ing that hundreds of thousands of 
students have been denied access to 
community colleges. 

"Community colleges play a 
central role in moving our students 
through the education system," said 
Carroll, who also stated that 67 per-
cent of CSU graduate students orig-
inally attended community colleges. 

Student attendees, along with 
State Treasurer' Phil Angelides and 
other lawmakers, including Alper!, 
sought solutions in closing eight 
specific corporate tall loopholes 
tl;tat represent a combined $386 
million annually in lost tax revenue. 

They stated in an April 27 
release that these particular loop-
holes do not benefit the California 

"We have to look at the ability 
to raise revenues [through taxes] a 
well," Alpert said. 

The statewide Stop the Cuts stu-
dent network supports Angelidcs' 
plan to close these loopholes. 

While students were plea ed 
with the representatives' concern 
for higher education and the pro-
po ed budget cuts, some said they 
felt disappointed that concrete 
solutions and action were not 
explicitly considered with sufficient 
time to enact them. 

"The concern shown by every-
one on the panel was sincere," 
Eleanor Ro~evelt 'College sopho-
more Whitney Sutterley said. 
"Perhaps the only fault was that 
actual solutions or suggestions for 
how to implement solutions were 
not addressed." 

Graduate Student Association 
Chair Heather Flowe urged the 
state leaders to make investing in 
higher education a top priority. 

"Let's not make a degree only a 
degree for the rich," Flowe said. 
"Education should be a right, not a 
privilege." .

Ledure: Reggio encourages 
critical look at technology 

contiJwed /rom page :l 
enization has led humans to 
embrace technology as a new form 
of religion. without critically exam-
ining its consequences on culrure 
and mentality. 

"The miracles of old, of]esus or 
Mohammed, or whatever your reli-
gious deities are, are like small 
evenlS compared to the miracles of 
the computer, or new technology." 
he said. 

Reggio also claimed that the 
price hwnans paid for .technol.ogical 
development was an IInmerslOn In 
virtual reali ty and a disconnection 
from the diverse, natural world. 

"Technology - while promis-
ing well-being. comfort. happiness 
[and) affluence - means power, 
control, conformity, uniformity," 
he said. 

Reggio concluded his lecrure by 
encouraging his audience to look 
cri tically at the effects of technolo-
gy and to be open to alternative 
lifestyles. 

"In order to be hopeful about 
the life we live, I'm suggesting to 
you that you be hopeless, .. . Reggio 
said. "Be hopeless about this order 
in order to be hopeful to create the 
world in which you wish to live. 
What I'm suggesting is that we 
seek the darkness from the blind-
ing light of technology." 

A majority of the students who 
attended the lecture wete from 
Sixth College's culture, art and 
technology classes. 

"I thought it was fascinating 
how he argued that technology has 
taken over our lives to the point 
tha t we don 't realize its effect on 
us. which was really apparent to me 
in his films." said Sixth College 
freshman Katie Hall . 

Sixth College administrators 
and professors also attended the 
lecture. 

"The talk that he gave ... was an 
important talk." said Linda Strauss, 
Sixth College core curriculum 
coordinator. "It was passionate, it 
was deeply humane, it was 
thoughtful and well-considered. 
The argument that he's offering, 1 

think, is a difficult one, and I think 
that the students are going to be 
really challenged by it. and that's 
what I want to see. n 

Other events for the 
Convocuion Week included 
screenings of other Reggio films, 
an exhibit of projects from CAT. 
students and an outdoor festival of 
student films from Sixth College 
and the visual arts department. 
Students also had a chance to par-
ticipate in several panel discussions 
with Reggio. 

"Reggio's visit to UCSD has 
been a very exciting and slgrufic~t 
event," said Gerald Doppelt, a phI-
losophy professor who teaches one 
of the classes in the CAT. 
sequence. "He is an important 
filmmaker, and his lecture and 
presence here has been very stimu-
lating and educational." . 

Sixth College Provost Gabriele 
Wienhausen felt that the week's 
events went well. 

"I think [the week] was very 
successful and it was successful 
because ~f ... Godfrey Reggio," 
Wienhausen said. "He is [not only 
an) incredible, intellectual perso~, 
but somebody who can commuru-
cate and convey and connect to all 
of us ... many students really were 
inspired by him." 

Reggio said he also felt inspired 
by his engagements with UCSD 
students throughout the week. 

"I was encouraged by the ... 
soulful interest in some of these 
things that I was trying to talk 
about," Reggio said. "I realize that 
they fiy in the face of what they' re 
being taught. but I thinlc it's impor-
tant to hear, wi thout being overtly 
dismissive, other points of view." 

Convocation Week is a cam-
puswide event put on by a speci~c 
college, in which a nonacademIC 
speaker is invited to visit the cam-
pus and provide a lecture f<?r. ~e 
general public. Other actlvloes 
throughout the week are designed 
[Q engage students intellecrually 
and to communicate the general 
educational philosophy of the par-
ticular college.

the DVC should have Uta ken rea-
sonable care in close cooperation 
with A.S ." 

Chiu said that the DVC has 
plans to work with Associated 
Students on future events. 
According to Chiu, the DVC hopes 
that students will be motivated to 
stand up against the student govern-
ment if they feel t1)at they have been 
wronged. 

"It is our responsibility as stu-
dents to make sure that we catch 
[Associated Students] whenever 
they do something wrong, or else 
they'll just continue to do it again 
and again," Chiu said. "We hope 
that this motivates any other stu-
dents or student organizations to 
use the judicial board as a forum to 
voice their opinions and q,ever to 
just sit there quietly when you 
believe that something is wrong."

Resources and tips to find that perfect living situation for the next academic year 

A fter time spent comfortably adapting to dorm life, you are moving off campus. It 
seems like a frightening step out-
side of a secure set of surround-
ings, and it is true that you will be 
leaving established relationships 
with suitemates, prepared hot 
meals and a close-knit envi ron-
ment of peers. It may be that the 
thought of finding an apa rtment 
and suitable roommates might be 
causing you obscene amounts of 
stress. There is no need to panic. 
With some helpful advice, the 
furure move can be an exciting 
and enjoyable experience. 

Before beginning a search of 
appropriate living spaces, consider 
who you can trUSt to be your 
roommates. A best friend does not 
necessarily make a good room-
mate. If your buddy is a television 
addict who falls asleep to reruns of 
"The Fresh Prince of Del Air" and 
you arc a light sleeper, you might 
want to think twice about living 
together. The Off-Campus 
Housing office gives further tips 
about picking roommates. In one 
of the workshops it spon ored, 
Student Legal Services advisor 
and education coordinator Elyce 
C. Morris warned of the joint and 
sever liabiliry. It is a measure to 
consider that stipu lates that 
"roommates are financially bound 

to each other," or put more sim-
ply, if one roommate runs off, the 
other is responsible for shelling 
out all of the cash for rent and any 
damages. 

Once you assemble a safe 
group, figure out what rype of 
uni t you arc looking for, the living 
situation, the maximum rent you 
are willing to pay, the location 
and transportation. La Jolla offers 
the perk of close proximiry to the 
campus and the beach, but rental 
prices tend to be steep. 

John Muir College junior David 
Miller remarked that U niversity 
C ity, which is a tad less pricey, is 
not as close as La Jolla, but it is no 
more than a five- to ) O-minute 
drive to campus. 

"It's acrua lly sort of nice that it's 
not so close," Miller sa id . "One 
cool thing is that people here who 
aren't studcnts are on average 40 
years old, so they'rc not that anal 
about noise." 

He also mentioned that 
Universiry Ciry seems to be at the 
center of everything. "You can just 
take [highway) 52 to [interstate) 5 
or [interstate] 805, and get pretty 
much anywhere," he sa id . 

T he less expensive regions, like 
Clairemont, Mira Mesa, Hillcrest 
and the beach communities, are 
within 20 minutes of campus and 
each provide a unique mix of li v-

ing space and enterta inment. 
Clairemont and Mira Mesa con-
sist mostly of si ngle famil y homes 
located near restaurants and shop-
ping venues. Hillcrest gives the 
illusion of living in a ciry with a 
thriving atmosphere and restau-
rants galore even though the 
region is located north of down-
town. Communities near the 
beaches, including Pacific Beach, 

" It's actually sort of nice 
that it's not so close [to 

UCSDJ." 
- David Miller, 

John Muir College junior and 
University atY FesicIent 

Mission Beach and Ocean Beach 
to the outh of La Jolla and Del 
Mar to the north, can be more 
costly and typically experience 
heavy traffic. However, the possi-
hiliry of stress-reducing nightly 
walks and daily excursions to the 
ocean might outweigh the 
e"pense. 

Several resources arc at your 
disposal once you determine a set 
of preferences. Off-Campus 

Housing, located in Stud ent 
Center, has daily updated listings of 
housing complexes (mostly of areas 
closer to campus), roommate list-
ings, and a referral service on their 
Web site at http://offcampushous-
ing.!ICSd.edu. It also provides sam-
ples of tenant resumes, leases, and 
rental applications, maps of shuttle 
and bus routes, and phone numbers 
of landlords. Keep in mind that a 
srudent ID number is needed to usc 
the customized search en gine. Erin 
McMurry, a member of the Off-
Campus Housing staff, said the 
advantage of using their service is 
that "we get people who are sympa-
thetic to students and know that 
they are posting to students." 

The c1assifieds section of news-
papers, or a quick drive around the 
neighborhood that is of interest to 
you are two other good options. If 
you have friends who live off cam-
pus, do not forget that they might 
have valuable information. 

McMurry suggests that if you 
want to move in during the sum-
mer, or if you want to secure a spot 
for the fall and do not mind paying 
rent over the summer, now is a 
good time to start looking for 
housing. Otherwise, a search dur-
ing the summer months should also 
be productive. However, some 
apartment complexes, particularly 
those in the areas close to UCSD, 

have wait lists, and you need to visit 
their lease offices independently.' 
McMurry stressed that the "impor-
tant thing is to keep your options 
open" and not rush because you 
don't want to sign a binding con-
tract before making a sound deci-
sion. 

A lease is a contract under 
which the landlord agrees to give 
the tenant ownership of a housing 
unit for a specific number of 
months as long as the tenant abides 
by prearranged regulations. Two 
types of leases exist: a periodic (or 
monthly) lease and a stated lease. 
Under a periodic, the tenant can 
leave after paying for the last 
month or may be asked to leave by 
the landlord, as long as both give a 
30-day notice . . A stated lease 
requires the tenant to stay and pay 
rent for a preset number of months. 
Subletting is a temporary option 
that must be approved by the land-
lord. It allows tenants to rent a part 
of their place to someone else for a 
specific amount of time. 

Once you find the perfect 
place, there are several legal mat-
ters you should keep in mind . 
Landlords may charge a holding 
deposit, which can range from 
$150 to $300. These deposits are

Spring recreation' opportunities in San Diego 
Take advantage of rising temperatures with fun outdoor activities 

By CHRlmNE ME 
Senior Staff writer 

UCSD enjoys fresh, sunny 
days and a sparkling ocean to 
compliment them. Look to the 
horizon at certain areas of the 
campus and, if you're lucky, you 
can spot hot air balloons floating 
in the distance, or hang gliders 
drifting along cliffs against the 
sunset. 

Spring has arrived, and that 
means warmer weather, idyllic 
beach outings and a desire to step 
out into what narure has to offer. 
La Jolla offers an array of recre-
ation activities to take advantage of 
the gorgeous weather and the 
brighter, longer days. 

Outback Advenrures, located 
in Sixth College, lists wilderness 
outings with brisk hikes, rock 
climbing, wild flower walks, 
kayaking and backpacking in the 
latest UCSD Spring Recreation 
catalog. 

"A lot of [srudents] say they 
don't even know about it, and 
that's kind of sad, Outdoor 
Advenrures staff member Susan 

Pearson said. "Unforrunately, we 
don't have many people signing 
up . We would love to have more 
student interest." 

UCSD students may seem 
vaguely aware of all the recreation 
activities that are available for free 
exploration, but there are only a 
handful of srudents who utilize 
the oppominity to its full poten-
tial by booking wilderness trips, 
packing their backpacks, stocking 
up on sun block lotion, and mak-
ing their way to the great out-
doors . 

Eleanor Roosevelt College 
sophomore Brad Simpson actively 
participates in rock climbing at 
the Canyonview gym climbing 
course and local areas in Santee 
Boulders and Joshua Tree 
National Park. 

"It' just a good time. Everyone 
is helping out with each other, and 
there are good people to climb 
with," Simpson said. 

If you would like to try hot air 
ballooning, companies like the 
Great American Balloon 
Company offer a number of rides, 
launching from local area like 

Lori Drahota/Cuardian 
Cool clown: Julia Yan& an Eleanor Roosevelt College junior, takes a break from 
the hot San Diego weather by going for a dip at Canyonview Pool on campus. 

Del Mar. Both romantic and 
thrilling, a ride during a clear, 
blue-skied day or a melting sunset 
with a significant other or with a 
group of friends could create the 
perfect and most memorable out-
ing. A standard hourlong ride is 
$130 per person. 

"Everyone can do it, it's adven-
rurous," Gertler said. "But maybe it 
just costs more than people would 
like to spend." 

Hiking and backpacking desti-
nations include San Jacinto near 
Palm Springs and near Big Sur 
along California's central coast-
line. Kayaking is offered in 
Mission Bay as well as in the San 
Diego bay. A pricier trip to the 
coastline of Santa Darbara is 
offered as well. 

Many of these activities have 
cheduled date, starting this May, 

with prices ranging from $35 to 
$56 for kayaking and $100 to $200 
for backpacking. 

"We try to keep the cost as bare 
bones as po sible," said Mike 
Wegner, associate director of 
O utback Adventures . "In addition, 
we offer great deals on rental 
equipment to get srudents out on 
their own, pretry much any activiry 
under the sun." 

utback Adventures al 0 pro-
vicies various equipment rentals. 
and their price are far cheaper 
than what La Jolla shops have to 
offer. Surfboard rentals at the cen-
ter starr at $23, while a rental at a 
10caJ beach shop can be up to $40 
an hour. 

UCSD Recreation will open 
the newly constructed ropes 

. course on May 11 . Labeled the 
Outback Team Challenge Course, 
the ropes course is something 
from a military training base or a 
challenge course on an MTV real-
iry show. Located behind East 
Parking and Thornton Hospital, 
the cour e was specifically created 
as a mechanism to develop the 
idea ls of teamwork within groups 

for students, staff, fraternities, 
sororities and many other student 
organizations here on campus. 
The 35-foot-high rope and log 
course is named the "Alpine 
Tower," and is intended as a team-
building obstacle course geared 
toward building communica tion 
ski lls. 

"It isn't just offering recreation 
to students, but leadership oppor-
runities." Wegner said. "From 
our standpoint, the recreation 
point of it provides a means to 
leadership for UCSD srudents," 
Wegner said . 

Inspired by Brian Grube, the 
director of Outback Advenrures, 
the ropes course is designed as a 
"rescue simulation" for all organi-
zations to participate in. 

"There are different skills of 
communication and trust. As a 
whole, it's about building team 
sense," Wegner said. "It's more of a 
challenge course than a jungle gym; 
it's not just for fun ." 

"We're very competitive in pric-
ing, especially for our tudents. We 
want them to access the outdoors," 
Wegner said. 

At the beaches in La Jolla, par-
ticularly Blacks Beach, hang gl iders 
are often seen flying languidly 
along the edge of tlle cliff: , enjoy-
ing the view of the vast Pacific. 
T hey come from the Torrey Pines 
Gliderport, a hang glid ing flight 
instruction center that provides 
lessons and gliders. 

Gliderport's Web site states, 
"Imagine yourself soaring with 
the red-tail hawks 500 to 1,500 
feet above the cliffs of Torrey 
Pines and the Pacific Ocean . 
Transcend the earthly bonds into 
a world of freedom, quiet and 
eMtilara tion ." 

Gliderport offers hang gliding 
and paragliding, which is similar to 
hang gliding, except paragliders use 
parachutes. Beginner paragliding 
lessons are offered, but are 
extremely pricy, sta rting at $795 for 

Lori Drahota/Cuardian 
So serene: A paraglider off the Torrey 
Pines Gliderport, a popular place for 
paragliding in the San Diego area. 
a three- to four-day program. But 
since La Jolla is the "paragliding 
paradise of the Pacific," according 
to Gliderport, the lessons may be 
worth it. 

As a far cheaper option, UC D 
organizations provide ample recre-
ation for srudents who are on a 
tight budget, including skydiving 
jumps. Far more inten~e than the 
more fluttering, serene aC[ivity of 
hang gliding, the UC D i,:ydiving 
Club offers tandem skydiving 
jumps. 

"There is a lot of ~kydiving 
around," said Luther Kurtz, the 
technical advisor of rhe UCSD 
Skydiving Club. "Definitely in 
Cali fornia, [sL:ydi\Cing] is popular. 
Most people want to go, they JUSt 
don't know about it."

play in, the Mission Bay Aquatic 
Center offers a plethora of various 
lessons including surfing, wake-
boarding, water skiing, sailing, 
windsurfing and rowing. An 
instruction-based center more than 
anything else, the aquatic center 
offers student discounts for all their 
activities. 

"It's not designed to JUSt have 
someone come [herel and go, but 
designed to teach," Mission Bay 
Aquatic Center manager Kevin 
Straw said. "Here it's more of a les-
son type of thing, where we're here 
to teach how to sail and once their 
lesson is over, they can come back 
whenever they want with friends or 
family." 

Noting the longer days and 
warmer weather, Straw said surfing 
and wakeboarding lessons are the 
most popular, but mentioned the 
popularity of moonlight byaking 

that is offered. 
"One thing that's been really 

popular for some dorm and student 
groups is the moonlight byaking 
event. They come in the evening 
and barbecue on the beach, and 
then take the kayaks out," Straw 
said. 

Additionally, sailing at Mission 
Bay may be easier for beginning 
learners because the bay features 
smooth treads with no harsh swells 
that are characteristic of the ocean.

It would be boring to stay 
indoors in this beautiful weather 
with so many recreational options 
available both on and off campus. 
So what are you waiting for? Take

location and have some fun in the

What do you know 
about food poisoning? 

to your 
health 

Neha Singh 
What do I need to know about 
food poisoning? 

- Anonymous, 
ReveUe College 

Food poisoning cases are more 
prevalent than you might think. 
The Center for Disease Control 
and Prevenrion estimates that the 
average person in America wilt 
have a food -borne illness once 
every three to four years. With 
this statistic in mind, it is impor-
tant to be aware of prevention and 
diagnostic tactics so you can 
greatly decrease your risk of get-
ting food poisoning, or you can 
get help quicL:ly if you display the 
symptOms. 

"There are a few key things 10 
do to avoid food poisoning on this 
campus," said Dr. Brad Buchman, 
director of clinical services at the 
Student Health Services. "Be sure 
to cook food like chicken, beef 

" 

Another key aspect to avoiding 
food poisoning is making sure 
everything is washed well to get rid 
of pesticides, bacteria and miaoor-
ganisms. 

"You need to make sure to 
thoroughly wash foods that are 
eaten raw," Buchman said. "It is 
possible to get food poisoning 
from fruits and vegetables you 
would not think are at high risk 
for food poisoning, like lettuce 
and cantaloupe. The pesticides 
sprayed on them need to be elim-
inated. If they are organic, you do 
not need to worry about pesti-
cides, but you do need to worry 
about microorganisms and bacte-
ria. There could be bacteria on 
the person's hand that picked it 
for you, which could lead to a case 
of food poisoning." 

What about those of you who 
like 10 consume raw eggs in the 
name of health? 

"Drinking raw eggs in a milk-
shake is not smarr for two reasons, " 
Buchman said. "One is the strong 
food-poisoning possibility of sal-
monella being present in the eggs, 
and the other is that the main pro-
tein in eggs needs to be cooked 
well for the human body to digest 
it." 

If you suspeCt you 
might have food poi -
soning even after 

and pork to pre-
vent food -borne 
ill nesses, si nee 
they need to be 
cooked thorough-
ly. According to 
Dr. Buchman, 
allhough thete 
are different 
tc;mperatures 
for cooking 

It is possible to get 
food poisoning from 
fruits and vegetables 
you would not think 

taking precautions, 
keep the following 
symptoms in mind. 

"Food poisoning 
can be present in a 
variety of ways," 
Buchman said. "Most 
often, there might be 
gastrointestinal-tract 
symptoms like nau-
sea, vomiting and 
diarrhea. It really 
depends on the sever-
ity of these core symp-
toms. Sometimes one 
might also have a 
fever, loss of energy 
and diffuse aches and 
pain." 

them, they 
should all be in 
the medium-
well to well-
done range to 
make sure the 
temperature is 
hot enough to 
kill off microor-
ganisms. The 
other key thing 
is to not let food 
sit at room tem-
perature for too 
long. Hot food 
and cold food is 
fine, but food at 
room tempera-
ture realty runs 
the risk of the 
microorganisms

are at high risk far 
food poisoning, like 

lettuce and 
cantaloupe. If they 
are argaruc '" you 
do need to u.orry 

about If you experience 
severe diarrhea or 
severe vomiting, you 
should seek help. 
Also, if you have 
diarrhea with blood 
in your stool or diar-
rhea with a high 
fever, you should see 
a doctor. 

microorganisms .and 
hac . " tena, 

The dangers of storing foods at 
room temperature does not only 
apply to meat and dairy products. 
Everyday items like salads and 
fresh juices can be suspeCt when il 
comes to food poisoning. 

"For instance, something as 
simple u potato salad can spoil 
easily," Dr. Buchman said. "If you 
store it in the fridge, the bacteria 
will not grow; if you heat it up, 
that bacteria will be killed. If it 
sits at room temperature for a 
number of hours, organisms can 
multiply very rapidly, and the 
toxin level in some organisms can 
increase also pretty rapidly. This 
is why when you eat something at 
a picnic that has been sitting for 
too long on a table, there is a risk 
of a lot of bacteria or a lot of tox-
ins being present in the food, 
which can lead to food poison-
ing." 

crosswordsolutions 

"If there are other 
symptoms, we advise people to go 
to a clear fluids diet, like water, 
Gatorade and apple juice," 
Buchman said. "Be careful not to 
drink citrus juices· like orange juice, 
since they are acidic and can often 
irritate the stomach. If you cannot 
keep anything down because of 
acute vomiting, get some medical 
help immediatdy."

poisoning, visit the Center for 
Disease Control and Prevention at

THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, MAY 10, 2004 

C.reW:.junior varsity finished in fourth place 
continued from page 110 

UCSD and Gonzaga resulted in 
UCSD rowing the fastest race of 
any boat of the 18 competitors in 
three heats, finishing in 6: 11.6. 
Gonzaga was hardly a boat·length 
in pursuit, crossing the line in 
6:12 .7, just 1.1 seconds in tow. 

Because of the method by which 
seedings are established at the cham-
pionship regatta, the Tritons' effon 
did not payoff as gready as they 
deserved. Despite earning the over-
all fastest preliminary race time, the 
winners of heats one and two 
retained the privilege of a higher 
seed due to their original placing 
prior to the race. 

In the first heat, No. 6 Puget 
Sound tried to match Orange 
Coast, and clocked a 6: 15.5 to the 
Pirates' 6:13.3, while upsetting No. 
5 Santa Clara and sliding into 
fourth place for the Grand Finals. 

The Grand Finals race was held 
in the early afternoon of May 2. Due 
to the narrow time margin between 
competitors, especially in the final 
event, the varsity eight racers knew 
that nothing was secured in the pre-
liminary heats. 'The Tritons vinually 
tied their own race speed from the 

May I races, finishing in 6: 11.5, 
while every other team except Santa 
Clara dropped several seconds off of 
previous races. Orange Coast 
chopped an unprecedented 11.8 sec-
onds &om 6: \3.3 on May I to 6:01.5 
at the Grand Finals. UC Davis gave 
the Pirates a run for their money in 
a nearly dead-even sprint to the fin-
ish in 6:01.6, one-tenth of a second 
out of first position, but 12.2 seconds 
faster than their May I race. 

Puget Sound shocked the field 
by cutting 7.5 seconds from its 
already impressive time, and 
cruised in for a 6:08 race in the 
Grand Finals. Gonzaga drafted in 
shortly thereafter, in 6:09.1, ahead 
of the Tritons, who found them-
selves more than two seconds back 
from the other boats ahead. 

The junior varsity boat faced a

Scheer also finished in a tie for 
eighth place, with a 216. He began 
with a 70 on May 3, and came back 
on May 4 with a 72. On May 5, he 
turned in a 1 4, only managing one 
birdie, instead of the three he had 
in each of the first two rounds. 
Scheer managed to play all three 
rounds without a double bogey. 

Junior Brian Duckworth came 
in third for the Tritons, tying for 
10th place overall with a score of 
217 . Duckworth started out on 
May 3 with a 71 and shot a 73 on 
May 4. On May , he started widl a 
birdie on the fi rst hole, and sunk 
three more birdies, but a double 
bogey on the seven th hole gOt him, 
and he finished with another 73 , 
one behind teammates Dolby and 
Scheer. 

Taking the fourth spot for UCSD 
was sophomore Ryo Yamada. His 
score of 2 23 was good enough to net 
him a tie for 23 rd place overall. 
Yamada continued with a 75 on May 

3, dropped down to a 73 on May 4, 
and ended things with another 75 on 
May S. He avoided a double bogey 
on May 5, while nerring two birdies. 

Rounding out the squad for 
UCSD was freshman Nick Jones, 
who finished with a 238. Jones shot 
an 80 on May 3, and came back with 
twO rounds of79 for May 4 and May 
5. He snagged twO birdies on May 5. 

The Tritons previously placed 
econd at this golf course last fall. 

"The course was a little more dif-
ficult than when we played it in the 
fall, partly caused by a steady rain for 
the first two days," Wydra said. "It's 
a wonderful course though , and 
you're not always using your driver 
off every tee. It was in bener shape 
than when we played it before, but 
the rain made it a little longer, and of 
COUT5e, there was the pressure that 
came with the competition." 

T he Tritons' performance at 
regionals was good enough to earn 
them an at-large bid to compete in 
the NCAA Division II finals taking 
place at the Victoria Hills Country 
Club in DeLand, Fla., from May 12 
through May 15. 

"No one is allowed to play the 
course for the entire season, except 
the host school, Rollins College, and 
no one can step on the property until 

May 3 at 10 a.m.," Wydra said. "Golf 
magazine rated it in the top 10 of 
public courses in Florida though, 
and we saw some pictures of it on the 
Internet. It looks very nice." 

UCSDs division at regionals, 
the Division II West, was host to 
three teams receiving at-large bids, 
a tie for the most bids given to any 
division, showing the strong com-
petition of the West. This will be 
UCSD's first trip to nationals since 
its move to Division II. The Tritons 
will be joined by 17 other teams, as 
well as 12 individual players. 

"It's awesome that we made 
nationals," Dolby said. "Its been our 
goal to qualify ever since we made 
the jump to Divi ion II fouf years 
ago, and to finally do it leels great. It 
was a Iso grea l to play well from stan 
to fini sh in the tournament." 

The Tritons will play four 
rounds, which can be followed via 
live scoring on

Sophomore Justin Grant, who 
was suffering from a case of vertigo 
during regionals, has rejoined the 
team and will compete at 
Nationals ill place of Jones. 

"The guys are a preny loose 
group, and I thirlk we're going to 
do really well." Wydra said.

MONDAY, MAY 10, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Tennis: laPlante named Coach of the Year 
caruinued from ~ 20 

and Mai Fujii 8-5, to give the 
Tritons their only win. 

The Tritons duo had previous-
ly lost to Tanaka and Fujii, 8-5, so 
had reason to be excited about the 
big win going into the singles 
matches. 

"This was th~ir best match all 
year," LaPlante said. "They had 
great rallies and for Julie winning 
this doubles match was a great way 
to end her collegiate career." 

In the singles lineup, 
Westerman had a difficult match 
against nationally ranked Beauvir 
and was unable to muster up the 
strength to beat her opponent. 
losing 6-3, 6-1. 

"Julie definitely played better 
than the score indicated. She had 
been working hard all month 
because she was not happy with 
her level of play and she definitely 
got it together for this match," 
LaPlante said. "Her opponent was 
a very good player, but Julie 
played her well." 

No. 2 singles brought a very 
close three-set match between 
Dao and Fujii. Dao was able to 
pick up a quick first set with a 6·1 
win over her opponent, but could 
not close out the match, and 
dropped the next two sets, 6-1, 6-
4. 

At No.4, Roberts also had a 
close three-set match in a see-
saw battle. Vicquenault won the 
first set, 6-2, but Roberts batded 
back to win the nnt set, 6-4, but 
lost the last set, 6-0. The final 
win for Hawaii-Hilo came at No. 
6 singles, as 'McKee won the first 
set, 6-4, but was only able to pick 
up .two more games for the rest 
of the match. The final score was 
4-6, 6-0, 6-2. 

The Tritons left the match 
with two unfinished matches at 
No. 3 and No.4 singles. Siddiqui, 

who played No. 3 singles, was 
leading her opponent, 7-6, 4-2, 
after having won the first set with 
a tiebreaker. Siddiqui played 
impressively despite a sore left 
wrist and elbow that left her 
unable to hit her regular backhand 
and forced her to use a slice back-
hand shot. 

Ar. No. 5 singles, Hilker was a 
point away from defeating Hangai 
when the match was called. Hilker 
played one of her best matches all 
year and had won the first set, 6-4, 
and was winning in the second, 6-5. 

The two wins would have 
made the overall match score 6-3, 
had they finished. 

"Overall, we played a whole lot 
tighter with Hawaii then we did 
last time," LaPlante said. "Last 
time we lost all but one of our sin-
gles, so our singles lineup have 
improved a whole lot since then." 

A win over Hawaii would have 
sent the women to Florida for the 
NCAA Top 16 tournament. For the 
Tritons, the loss meant the close of 
the season. The team's goal of 
being California CoUegiate Athletic 
Association Champions came true 
and four of their players were 
placed on AIl-CCAA teams. 

McKee was named the league's 
Freshman of the Year after blazing 
a perfect 7 -0 in league playas the 
No. 6 singles player. At No. 3 

. doubles, McKee posted a 6-1 dou-
bles record. Roberts, Hilker, and 
Dao also joined McKee on the 
CCAA First Team. Roberts, who 
played No. 3 singles, posted a per-
fect 8-0 record in league playas 
did Hilker who switched between 
No.4 and No. 5 singles. 

"It's hard to pinpoint JUSt one 
girl that really stood out on this 
team, though," LaPlante said. 
"No one stood out, it was just a 
great group effon, and everyone 
shared a pan of every win ." 

Dao was 7-1 at No.2 singles, 
and together with Westerman, the 
two went 7-1 during the season at 
No. I doubles. Westerman and 
McKee were also given the honors 
of Player of the Week in league 
during the season. Also honored 
by her colleagues was LaPlante, 
who was named CCAA Coach of 
the Year. 

Another reason for the Tritons 
huge success this season was assis-
tant coach Timmer Wiling, who 
helped improve the team's strategy 
and doubles play considerably. 

"Timmer really helped to 
motivate the women and work on 
their game," LaPlante said. "I 
have to give him a lot of credit." 

After this year, the Tritons will 
lose three seniors, including cap-
tains Westerman and Kristina 
Jansen and Sarah Bahlert. The 
doubles lineup will have to read-
just as well because sophomores 
Allison and Jenna Ishii will take a 
year off to study abroad for the 
upcoming year. 

One of the biggest highlights 
for the girls during the season was 
beating Hawaii Pacific 6-3, which 
clinched their spot at No.3 in the 
conference. The Tritons ended 
their season with an overall 18-0 
record, with the final rankings 
coming out in a couple weeks. 

"Overall this was a great 
group of girls and I had a lot of 
fun with this team," LaPlante 
said. "The girls got along so well, 
when they would see each other 
at practice they were always chat-
ting away and they motivated 
each other on the court. They 
truly cared about each otller; the 
team chemistry was something 
that all coaches hope for and it 
was so nice to see how they have 
evolved as a team throughout the 
season. It's sad to see the season 
come to an end."

Baseball: UCSD unable to 
defeat Sonoma State twice 

continued from page :10 
UCSD pitcher Navarro threw 

eight innings, allowing just seven 
hits and two runs while striking out 
eight and not walking a single 
Seawolf batter. He held the 
Sonoma State hean of the order. 
A11-CCAA first·teamers center 
fielder Nate Durham-Hammer, 
right fielder Brandon Burgess and 
first baseman Tom Everidge, to a 3-
for-12 day with an RBI and two 
runs scored. Navarro improved to 
6·2 with the victory. The 'first-time 
conference honoree as a third team 
selection has won each of his last 
four decisions. 

"[Our success] all searts on the 
mound," O'Brien said. "Jose 
[Navarro] set the tone for the 
entire day. He kept us in the ball -
game until our bats came alive." 

UCSD was not nearly as suc-
cessful on May 6, the second day of 
the conference championships, 
when Chico State handily downed 
the Tritons 11-4. UCSD commit-
ted five errors in the field against 
Chico State, while the Wildcats 
produced a double-digit run total 
for a second straight game. 

With UCSD ahead 1-0 and 
junior right-handed pitcher Logan 
Boutilier throwing a solid game, 
Chico State put together a six-run 
founh inning. 

All six runs were unearned due 
to a pair of fielding errors by 
Pinocchio. The Wildcats sent 10 
batters to the plate, with the key 
two-run double down the left field 
line by junior second baseman Jeff 
Walker. Chico State added single 
runs in the fifth and sixth innings, 
and three runs in the eighth to 
close out the game. 

The loss pitted the Tritons 
against Sonoma State for a second 
time in the '_ournament, and this 

[;mID 

time, the Seawolves sought 
revenge . Sonoma State beat the 
Tritons 6-2, the identical score of 
the first game between the two of 
which UCSD had come out on the 
winning end. 

For the Tritons, UCSD's first 
run came with two outs in the sec-
ond inning, as senior third baseman 
Keith Albrecht came through with 
a single, following freshman catch-
er David Morehead's double. After 
Sonoma State put up four runs in 
the bottom of the fourth, the 
Tritons got one back with the duo 
that produced their first run play-
ing a key role again. Morehead and 
Albrecht opened the inning with 
consecutive singles, with Morehead 
advancing to third on Albrecht's 
hit. Sophomore Damian Fante, 
pinch-hitting for David Gomez, 
then put down a perfect bunt to 
first base that allowed Morehead to 
score his second run of the game. 

Those two runs were all UCSD 
could muster as it fell to Sonoma 
State, eliminating the Tritons from 
the double-elimination tourna-
ment. 

Sonoma State went on to face 
Chico State in the CCAA champi-
onship game on May 7. T he two 
teams battled it out and the game 
came down to the wire. Chico 
State, the only CCAA team to play 
in all six CCAA championship 
baseball tournaments, captured its 
second CCM tide on May 7 with 
an 8-7 victory over Sonoma State. 

Although a first-ever berth is 
not likely, the Tritons will now have 
to sit and wait for the announce-
ment of the NCAA Division II 
Championship field . The top four 
teams in each region advance to the 
NCAA postseason. UCSD is in 
fifth as of the latest poll, with 
Sonoma State at No.4.

Iy COURTNEY FIELD 

Senior Staff Writer 

On May 5 and May 6, the 
UCSD baseball team was eliminat-
ed at the 2004 California Collegiate 

thletic Association Champion hip, 
losing against Chico State and top-
seed onoma State in the double-
elimination tournament. 

The TritOns beat defending 
CCAA champion Sonoma State in 
the first game of the 2004 CCAA 
Championship tournament on May 
5 at Arrowhead Credit Union Park 
in San Bernardino, Calif. by a core 
oH-2. Thi put the TritOns in the 

winners' bracket for competition on 
the second day of the tournament. 
On May 6, UCSD lost to Chico 

tate, 11-4. The Tritons then faced 
Sonoma State again, which had 
knocked Cal State San Bernardino 
out of the tournament earlier in the 

. day, in an elimination game where 
Sonoma State downed UCSD, 6-2, 
and knocked the Tritons out of the 
double-elimination tournamen t. 
The Tritons finished the season 
with an overall record of 35-24. 

In UCSD's first ever postsea-
son game, the Tritons came from 
behind to overtake Sonoma State. 
Down 2-1 through seven innings, 

UCSD put together a five-run 
rally in the top of the eighth 
inning to earn the victory. 

Triton junior shortstop Keith 
Hernandez led off the big inning 
with a single to right field. Senior 
designated hitter Jeff Riddle then 
singled to left-center and junior first 
baseman Brian Robinson drew a 
walk. With the bases loaded, junior 
leftfielder Joel Clark flied out to 
right field and drove in Hernandez. 
UCSD scored two runs through a 
series of walks and stolen bases. 
Junior econd baseman Ricky 
Pinocchio doubled horne the final 
two runs of the inning. 

Hernandez, Riddle, Clark and 
Pinocchio all earned conference 
honors and were named to the All-
CCAA conference second team. 
Senior outfielder Brett Burton and 
sophomore pitcher Jose Navarro 
were named to the All-CCAA 
third team. 

"The guys acted like they've 
been [in the playoffs] before, even 
though this is our first time," 
UCSD head coach Dan O'Brien 
said. "Our guys were confident 
and relaxed all game, and that was 
the key."

Everyone knows that anything 
can happen during a championship 
match, no matter what sport is 
being played. The Tritons' varsity 
eight boat was the victim of this 
reality May 1 and May 2 at the 
Western Intercollegiate Rowing 
Association Championships hosted 
by the Sacramento State Aquatic 
Center at Lake Natoma, Calif. 

UCSD entered one varsity boat 
and one junior varsity boat in each of 
their respective Grand Finals events; 
the varsity eight emerged in fifth 
place in six minutes, 11.5 seconds 
and the junior varsity pulled in 
fourth place in a 6:24.5 race. 

The Tritons' varsity team began 
May I seeded third overall and first 
in its preliminary heat, in which the 
boat raced in the lane next to No.4 
rival Gonzaga. The varsity eight 
boats representing No. I-seed 
<Mnge Coast College and No. 2 
UC Davis had the luxury of compet-
ing directly against teams which 
were seeded considerably lower than 
them, and were not put under the 
same pressure that UCSD faced to 
edge out Gonzaga. This allowed the 
faster teams to continue to extend 
their taper into the Grand Finals.

The UCSD golf team placed 
fourth in a field of eight teams at the 
NCAA Division II Western 
Regionals, held May 3 through May 
5at the Bellingham Golf and 
Country Club, in Bellingham, Wash. 

The Tritons' perfonnance at 
regionals was good enough to earn 
them an at-large bid to compete in 
the NCAA Division IT finals taking 
place at the 
Victoria Hills 
Country Club in 
DeLand, Fla., 
from May 12 
through May 15. 

The Tritons 
were in second 
place through 
the second day 
of competition, 
shooting 284 
and 29 1 on the

par-288 course overall. On May 5, 
however, they encountered difficul-
ty, clo ing out the tournament with a 
297. Their overall tournament score 
was an 8-over-par 872, slipping two 
places to finish i.n fourth, behind 
Chico State, St Martin's College 
and Cal State Stanislaus. 

"The most impressive thing 
about the guys' perfonnance was 
not how well they did, but that they 
only did it with four guys scoring, 
since our fifth man didn't score 
once," UCSD head coach Mike 
Wydra said. "If one of them had 
had a bad day, we would have been 

out of the tournament." 
Chico State, which got off to a 

slow start on May 3, came back on 
May 4 and May 5 to solidify its lead, 
shooting rounds of 287, 281 and 
287. The Wtldcatscame away with a 
team total of 855 and their rounds 
on May 4 and May 5 were the low 
rounds of the day, with 281 being 
the low round of the tournament. 

St. Martin's, which was tied with 
Cal State Stanislaus for third place 
behind UCSD after May 4, was 
able to edge out both teams on May 
5, earning a 294 to end up with an 
868, good enough for second place. 

Cal State Stanislaus came out on 
May 5 and shot a 294 to finish with 
an 871, one ahead ofUCSD, giving 
the team a third place finish. 

Individually, two Tritons tied for 
the lead for UCSD, junior Joe 
Dolby and senior team captain Alan 
Scheer. Dolby opened up the tour-
nament with a 68 on May 3, the low 
round of the clay on the par-72 
course, and tied for the lowest rOlmd 
of the competition. He came back on 
May 4 with a 73 and finished with a 
75 on May 5, to give him an even-
par 216 overall and a tie for eighth 
place. Dolby had an eagle on the first 
hole on May 5. It was UCSO's lone 
eagle, but Dolby was burdened by a 
double bogey on the 17th hole. 

"This was the first week in my 
career that I contended for the lead 
throughout the tournament,"

UCSD bounced out of NCAA tourney 
Women's tennis loses 6-1 to Hawaii-Hilo 

By ANGELA UN 
Staff Writer 

On May 7, the 15th-ranked 
UCSD women's tennis team had 
their season come to an end with a 
6-1 loss to Hawaii-Hilo in the sec-
ond round of the NCAA tourna-
ment in Hilo, Hawaii. 

Coming off a five-match win-
ning streak, the Tritons were 
unable to muster the power to beat 
a tough Hawaii team to head to 
Florida for the NCAA Top 16 
tournament. The Tritons, who lost 
6-3 to Hawaii earlier in the season, 
had practiced hard throughout the 
week in order to prepare for a 
highly anticipated rematch. 

The Tritons flew to Hawaii on 
May 5 but were unable to practice 
as much as they liked after being 
plagued by a few rain delays. 

"Before we went to Hawaii, we 
were trying to decide on who to 
bring," UCSD head coach Liz 
LaPlante said. "We had been trav-
eling with ten girls throughout the 
season, but we \mew that we would 
later run into the problem of being 
allowed to only travel with eight, 
which is an NCAA regulation." 

Two days after arriving to 
Hawaii, the Tritons finally had the 
chance to prove themselves 
against lOth-ranked Hawaii-Hilo. 
The match drew a large crowd of 
Vulcan supporters, including sev-
eral fans who needed to be warned 
by officials. 

The match began with two 
quick wins by Hawaii-Hilo in the 
doubles lineup. Hawaii-Hilo's 
Estelle Vicquenault and Krystal 
Hangai defeated freshman Kristin 
Bronowicki and sophomore Tara 
Siddlqui, 8-2, and UCSD fresh-

man Katie McKee and sophomore 
Leigh Roberts were unable to pull 
a game from Dorothee Beauvir 
and Tiana Lum-Tucker and lost 
8-0. 

Perhaps the highlight of the 
entire match against Hawaii-Hilo 

was at No. 1 doubles, senior Julie

doubles all year and grabbed a 
huge win over Michiko Tanaka
