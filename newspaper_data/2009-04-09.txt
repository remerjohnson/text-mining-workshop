With only a few weeks left in 
office, Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Naasir Lakhani submitted 
legislation to the A.S. Council last 
night that changed the process by 
which student organizations receive 
funding.

Approved unanimously by the 
council, the plan will increase basic 
operational funding for student orga-
nizations from a maximum of $20 to 
a maximum of $400 while eliminat-
ing the option to request separate 

funds for travel 
expenses. The 
change also 
eliminates quar-
terly program-
ming reqests 
and implements 
a rolling request 
process with 
no limits on 
the ammount 
of funding that 
may be granted.

The council will discuss the sec-
ond half of the legislation, which 
seeks to establish a committee of 

individuals appointed specifically to 
oversee these funding requests.

The proposed advisory commit-
tee would meet once a week during 
the academic year to consider each 
funding request, and would then rec-
ommend an allocation to the A.S. 
Council.

This has been a yearlong proj-
ect for Lakhani, a graduating senior. 
Peter Benesch, current associate vice 
president of athletic relations and 
candidate for Lakhani’s position in 
2009-10, worked alongside Lakhani  
in making the revisions.

Lakhani observed the student-

organization funding process at other 
UC campuses to improve the pro-
cedure currently used by ASUCSD, 
which requires organizations to sub-
mit funding requests for the follow-
ing quarter by week five of the previ-
ous quarter.

“The system is clearly broken,” 
Lakhani said. “Although our system is 
supposedly objective, it is still biased 
toward orgs that understand the sys-
tem. The orgs that know [the process] 
know which boxes to fill out and get 
the most funding.”

Both Lakhani and Benesch agree 
that the changes will benefit both the 

A.S. Finance Office and the organiza-
tions seeking funds, in that neither 
party will have to worry about spe-
cific quarterly deadlines.

“Right now, 90 percent of requests 
are done by my position and the AVP 
Student Orgs position,” Lakhani said. 
“The finance committee only looks 
at the most miniscule things, which 
I think is wrong. The bigger requests 
need to have more eyes on them. This 
model allows student orgs to show 
the merits of their event.”

COUNCIL GRANTS STUDENT ORGS INCREASED START-UP FUNDS

Freshman Admissions Rate Hits Decade Low

By Kimberly Cheng
Associate News Editor

The lowest percentage of fresh-
men in nearly decade received accep-
tance letters from the University of 
California this year. UCSD admission 
rates fell almost 4 percent from last 
fall. 

According to data released by the 
university on Tuesday, of the 41,411 
UCSD applicants, only 15,718 were 
offered admission — 2,000 fewer than 
were accepted last year. Systemwide, 
UCSD received the second most 
freshmen applications this year. 
UCLA received the most at 46,104, 

and UC Irvine received the third most 
at 40,733. 

Although a record 80,820 students 
applied to at least one of the nine 
undergraduate UC campuses, the per-
centage of in-state admits dropped 
from 75.4 percent to 72.5 percent. 

Admissions increased at three 
UC campuses, with Berkeley admit-
ting 526 more students than last year, 
Riverside adding 2,558 and Merced 
rising by 193.

Nearly all racial groups — includ-
ing blacks, Latinos, Asians and whites 
— saw a decline in UCSD admis-
sions, with the exception of American 
Indians, whose numbers rose from 63 
students last year to 65 this year. The 
number of white admits took the big-
gest dive, down by 777 students.

UCSD admits 38 percent 
of applicants, down from 
41.7 percent in 2008. 

A.S. Programming Drops $32K on Sun God Security

By Reza Farazmand
News Editor

“Discretion” will be the word of 
the day at next month’s Sun God 
Festival, when 45 police officers 
descend upon RIMAC Field armed 
with zip ties, Breathalyzers and 
enough probable cause to round up 
the majority of an expected 20,000 
attendees. 

Despite attempts by A.S. 
Programming to reduce security 
costs for this year’s festival, a police 
force as beefed up as last year will 
again patrol campus come May 15, 
though fewer officers will be present 
during the festival’s daytime hours.

Security alone will cost students 
a hefty $32,223.87, approximately 17 
percent of the festival’s total oper-
ating budget. This sum will pri-
marily pay the overtime salaries of 
campus police officers from UCSD, 
San Diego State, UC Irvine and UC 
Riverside. 

The presence of Staff Pro guards 
— those yellow-jacketed rent-a-cops 
seen patrolling at many campus events 
— will increase due in part to the 
addition of the dance tent, a massive 
enclosure that will host a number of 

deejay acts, including top-billed head-
liner Girl Talk. According to Associate 
Vice President of Programming Garret 
Berg, the extra guards were necessi-
tated by a decision to allow attendees 
to dance on stage during the Girl Talk 

performance.

UCSD UC SYSTEMWIDE

By Heather Houry
Staff Writer

Recent concern over the absence 
of a “Middle Eastern” option on the 
UC application has led university 
officials to consider expanding the 
range of racial categories, an attempt 
to recognize ethnicities presently 
grouped as “white.”

According to UC spokesman 
Ricardo Vazquez, the university cur-
rently includes Middle Eastern stu-
dents in the “white” category to keep 
classifications as simple as possible.

On the front lines of the campaign 
to add a “Middle Eastern” option to 
the UC application are UCLA stu-
dent organizations the United Arab 
Society, the Iranian Student Group, 
the Armenian Student Association, 
the Afghan Student Association and 
the Syrian Club. 

Yasi Chehroudi, president of ISG 
at UCLA, said admissions statistics 
are not useful when they combine 
racial groups. 

“When the university clumps peo-
ple, it’s hard to see trends,” Chehroudi 
said. “It’s detrimental when the 
demographics don’t match.”

The current U.S. Census Bureau 
similarly categorizes people of 
Middle Eastern descent as white. 
Middle Eastern interest groups lob-
bied for this change in the late 1970s 
in order to achieve greater immigra-
tion rights. 

However, Faisal Attrache, 
President of UCLA’s UAS, said this 
categorization is no longer an advan-
tage.

“As Arab, we don’t feel that ‘white’ 
is representative of us,” Attrache said. 

Noticably lighter police

daytime portion of

incresae after nightfall.

The Sun God Festival drew a crowd of approximately 18,000 in 2008. This year, 45 police officers from UCSD, San Diego State University, UC Irivne and UC 
Riverside will patrol RIMAC Field and the surrounding area. Additional security will be provided by Staff Pro guards hired for the event.

planning forum during Fall Quarter, 
was partially able to achieve this 
goal by ensuring that fewer officers 
would be present on and around  
festival grounds during the earlier 
hours of the festival.

In contrast, the police force will 
grow at nightfall.

“Last year, a very large percent-
age of the officers were there for the 
full festival,” Berg said. “The major-
ity of those officers 
coming this year 
are coming later in 
the day — once the 
sun sets, after our 
more mellow acts 
are off, kind of at 
more appropriate 
times and for fewer 
hours.”

Berg said the 
excessive num-
ber of police offi-
cers at last year’s 
event helped him 
decide to redistrib-
ute police activ-
ity throughout the 
day.

“There are defi-
nitely times during the festival when 
it’s appropriate to have a larger police 
presence than at other times,” Berg 
said. “Last year, the problem was that 
during the day, as people were arriv-
ing, there was this overwhelming 
police presence. I was seeing pictures 
of people getting arrested with four 
cops standing around them. That’s 
kind of what we wanted to prevent 
this year.”

The redistribution also allowed 

for a reduction in the total cost of 
security, though these savings were 
offset by a lack of grant funding for 
the police department. While last 
year UCSD police were able to cover 
approximately $40,000 of this total 
cost with the use of such grants, this 
year the programming department 
was forced to compensate for much 
of this cost. 

“Unfortunately the cost wasn’t 
able to go down because the money 

that we would 
have saved was 
pretty much offset 
by [the UC Police 
D e p a r t m e n t ’s ] 
lack of grant sup-
port,” Berg said. 
“Our costs would 
have gone down, 
but without grant 
support, our costs 
went down a lot 
and then went back 
up a lot.” 

According to 
UCSD police Lt. 
Dave Rose, the true 
cost of security for 
the festival will be 
unavailable until 

after the event. 
Although Berg promised that no 

undercover police officers would 
be present at the event, he said 
his department would be unable to 
regulate the presence of undercover 
Alcoholic Beverage Control officers 
at campus venues outside of the fes-
tival grounds, such as Porter’s Pub.

“No one really thinks of us as white.”
The UC application currently 

includes 28 ethnicity options, 23 of 
which were added in 2007 as part of 
the Asian Pacific Coalition’s “Count 
Me In” campaign. The campaign, 
much like the one now being orga-
nized by Middle 
Eastern students 
at UCLA, lobbied 
for the inclusion 
of more ethnic cat-
egories on the UC 
application.

Chehroudi said 
she would like to 
see several dif-
ferent subcatego-
ries included on 
the application, including Iranian, 
Arab, Armenian, Syrian and 
Turkish.

The UCLA campaign has not 
spread to the other UC campuses, 
though it has received student sup-
port from other universities  — due 
in part to a March 31 article in the 
Los Angeles Times about the present 
UC policy. 

“It is disappointing that the UC 
system, especially considering its 
prestige, does not have a ‘Middle 
Eastern’ option,” said Hameen Oriqat, 
member of the UCSD Muslim 
Student Association and Students for 
Justice in Palestine. “Other state and 
private schools have the category, so I 

don’t know why we 
don’t.”

According to 
Vazquez, the addi-
tion of the “Middle 
Eastern” option 
would involve mod-
ifications to the uni-
versity’s computer 
systems as well as 
to computers at the 
individual cam-

puses. 
He said in an e-mail Wednesday 

that adding racial categories could 
improve the quality and usefulness 
of student data, but they are still 
considering the logistical and mon-
etary implications of such a change.

THURSDAY, APRIL 9, 2009 THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS  3

The medium weighted high-
school GPA for UCSD admits was 
4.09, up from 4.06 last year, and the 
average SAT score increased from 
1,931 to 1,955. 

About 10,000 UC-eligible students 
rejected by all campuses to which 
they applied will be offered admission 
to UC Merced or UC Riverside this 
month, UC director of undergradu-
ate admissions Susan Wilbur said in 
a statement. 

Wilbur said the economic reces-
sion this year could result in more 
students attending the University of 
California instead of a higher-cost 
private school. However, it could also 
result in more students opting for the 
California State University or com-
munity colleges — rather than attend-
ing an out-of-town UC campus. 

The biggest plunges in acceptance 
rates occurred at UC Santa Cruz, 
where admission fell from 74.3 percent 
to 63.7 percent; UC Davis, where it 
decreased from 52.4 percent to 46.2 
percent; and UC Irvine, which dropped 
to 42.8 percent from 49 percent. 

UCLA showed the lowest overall 
admission rate at 21.4 percent, fol-
lowed by UC Berkeley at 29.5 percent 
and UCSD at 38 percent.

In January, the UC Board of 
Regents announced its intention to 
cut to freshmen enrollment by 2,300 
students for fall 2009 due to insuf-
ficient state funding and previous 
overenrollment. University officials 
are hoping to enroll about 33,000 
California freshmen this year and 
boost community college transfer 
admits by 500.

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox gave a most inspirational little speech at last night’s council 
meeting, which was somewhat poorly 
attended. She commended an absent 
President Donna Bean for “her great 
leadership” in bringing many student 
issues to the Chancellor’s Office and 
expressed her wish that the next A.S. 
president continue the trend.

During Fox’s short presenta-
tion she mentioned the need for 
California to pass Proposition 1A 
so that the university would have 
a feasible operat-
ing budget for the 
next year. She also 
joked about the 
Admit Day e-mail 
debacle.

“I know you 
heard about our 
little problem,” Fox said. “It’s gener-
ated a little bit of interest in the mail 
coming in, but I say that you can’t buy 
advertisement like that.”

Student Foundation President 
Sarah Chang and trustee and Revelle 
College Senator Katie Hall gave the 
latest update on UCSD’s inaugural 
Dance Marathon, which is set to take 
place on May 8 and 9 in the Price 
Center East Ballroom. Details will 
be available on ucsddancemarathon.
ucsd.edu after Friday.

Last week’s open roll-call vote — 
in which coucilmembers call in a vote 
at will over an extended period of 
time — was unfortunately marred by 
the behavior of various councilmem-
bers whom Associate Vice President 
of Academic Affairs Lana Blank 
called out in a letter to the council. 
Speaker Jordan Taylor clarified to 
the council that lobbying an issue 
during open roll call is not allowed.

The council passed an amend-
ment that eliminates changing votes 
during open-call voting.

Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Naasir Lakhani then 
approached the microphone stand 
and belted out the first line of the 
DuckTales theme song as an admi-
rable segue into a presentation on 
the proposed changes in the funding 
process for student organizations. 

Lakhani quickly sobered up as 
he explained the problems with the 
quarterly and weekly funding pro-
cess as it now exists. His proposal 
includes an increase in the operating 
budget cap from $20 to $400. He 

also took the time 
to address all the 
possible critiques 
of the funding 
system.

“Just do it,” 
Hall said dur-
ing discussion in 

hopes of speeding up the dialogue 
and voting process.

The issue was split into two and 
the changes to the standing rules 
passed 20-0-0. Voting on the doc-
ument concerning the Student 
Organization Funding Advisory 
Board was postponed for a week so 
that Lakhani could rework and clarify 
the language defining the composi-
tion and role of the committee.

Marshall College Senator Monica 
Figueroa opened up an old can of 
worms when she motioned to recon-
sider the open roll-call vote on last 
week’s hotly debated issue of whether 
the executive members could vote, 
which Associate Vice President of 
Student Advocacy Frank Carroll 
supported due to the apparently 
inappropriate lobbying that occurred 
during the open roll-call period. The 
motion passed 10-4-4, and was then 
mercifully postponed indefinitely.

Friday’s Bear Garden may be can-
celled due to rain. Stay tuned for 
weather reports.

The views expressed herein do not necessarily represent the opinions of the UCSD Guardian, the University of California or Associated Students.

Flops to UC Santa Cruz for attempting to 
quell 4/20 festivities by banning overnight 

guests and reaching out to freshmen 
parents with a cautionary e-mail. 

Props to Vermont for being the first state 
to legalize gay marriage via legislative 
action rather than through 
the courts on Tuesday.

Applying to the University of California, you’re faced with a daunting application filled 
with pages upon pages of forms ask-
ing for everything from high-school 
grades and standardized test scores to 
your parents’ income and family size. 

But for some students, the por-
tion of the university application con-
cerning racial identity poses a serious 
personal challenge — specifically, for 
students of Middle Eastern heritage. 
Of the application’s 28 officially recog-
nized racial categories, none apply to 
Middle Eastern students, forcing them 
to check either “white” — the category 

under which they have been grouped 
by the U.S. Census Bureau since 1970 
— “Asian” or “African,” depending on 
their family’s origins. Some students 
mark “other” or decline to state their 
racial identity because they feel none 
of the official groups apply to them.

A coalition of student groups from 
UCLA is lobbying the university to 
modify the application to provide an 
additional category for Middle Eastern 
students. These students feel that 
they are not ethnically “white” and 
being grouped as such is detrimen-
tal to the university’s racial statistical 
data, which is used for outreach and 

retention efforts across the 10-campus 
system. 

Using momentum from the uni-
versity’s 2007 decision to include 23 
more racial options — led by the Asian 
Pacific Coalition’s “Count Me In” 
campaign, which added groups such 
as Pakistani, Hmong and Samoan — 
Middle Eastern students now want 
their concerns addressed, but have 
faced hurdles as UC administrators 
consider the costs of adjusting univer-
sity computer systems to accommo-
date the request. 

Ultimately, however, the benefits 
of such a change far outweigh the 

costs. Middle Eastern students are no 
more culturally white than Chinese 
are Korean, and leaving them exclud-
ed skews valuable statistical data. 
Especially considering the new admis-
sion policy — which de-emphasizes 
test scores and gives more consider-
ation to personal circumstance and 
under which white students have been 
projected to make significant admis-
sions gains — altering the application 
data to allow a Middle Eastern cat-
egory could provide a more accurate 
picture of just exactly who is admitted, 
offering a greater insight into the uni-
versity’s true diversity.

Student organizations are far and away one of the most impor-tant facets of campus life. These 
groups provide outlets for student 
expression and routes by which to 
engage with and serve the campus 
community. They allow us to grow as 
individuals and develop our personal 
interests. They encourage us to inter-
act with our peers on a level beyond 
that achieved in dorms or at parties, 
creating relationships based around 
shared interests and promoting the 
kind of informed discourse that our 
years in college are meant to facilitate.

Naturally, then, one of the pri-
mary objectives of our student gov-
ernment should be to provide these 
organizations with all the resources 
necessary for them to thrive suc-
cessfully within our campus com-
munity. Last night, the A.S. Council 
did just this, approving a revision to 
its standing rules that dramatically 
increases the funds available to these 
organizations while streamlining the 
process through which these funds 
are granted. 

Penned by Vice President of 
Finance and Resources Naasir 
Lakhani, the new legislation allows 
registered student organizations to 
request up to $400 in initial operat-
ing funds, a dramatic improvement 
over the previous $20 limit. At the 
same time, the changes allow for 
uncapped programming funding 
requests which can be pursued at any 
point throughout the year with no 
worry of impending deadlines. 

This improvement will be par-
ticularly beneficial to new organiza-
tions that may previously have had 

trouble getting off the ground. In the 
past it was often necessary for those 
involved in these organizations to dig 
into their own pockets in an effort 
to fund their activities, so slow and 
inefficient was the council’s process 
for granting funding to these groups. 
Under the new process, however, 
organizations will be able to request 
and receive all necessary funds in 
a timely manner, thus guaranteeing 
that these groups are able to succeed 
while encouraging the emergence of 
new organizations.  

On a more tangible level, greater 
support for our student organiza-
tions translates directly into a more 
improved campus atmosphere. By 
ensuring that these organizations 
are attended to in an efficient man-

ner with the resources they need 
to thrive, the council also ensures 
that our campus remains alive with 
activity as these groups stage their 
various events, participate in campus 
politics and provide students with an 
outlet for pursuing a diverse range of 
interests. 

Of course, this new legislation 
is not without its downsides. For all 
the good that comes with increased 
funding for student organizations, 
there also comes the inherent pos-
sibility of the council stretching its 
funds too thin. Though this out-
come is unlikely to appear anytime 
soon given the now inflated status 
of the council’s bank account (aren’t 
referenda great?), it is still a possibil-
ity of which councilmembers should 

remain aware. 
Until then, however, more power 

to the orgs. 

With Org Funds Up and Access Easier, Money Ain’t a Thang

A Local Apple 
a Day Keeps 

the Pesticides 
Away

Before organic food began lining supermarket shelves, I bought oranges without question-
ing their origins. But as the green 
fever became too prevalent to ignore, 
I began to question the innocence of 
my produce: Who grew it? How was it 
grown? How was it supposed to taste?

Apparently, the average apple is 
grown with pesticides and monocul-
tures, and has most likely been geneti-
cally modified. Your organic apple usu-
ally skips the chemical bath, but isn’t 
guaranteed to come from a tree near 
you — which is why students should 
also make sure to buy local. If students 
want to make sure they’re buying local 
they should purchase food from no 
further than 100 miles away. The aver-
age fresh food item travels 1,500 miles 
to get to your dinner table, accord-
ing to Rich Pirog, associate director 
of the Leopold Center for Sustainable 
Agriculture.

Despite the time and fuel involved 
in long-distance transport, we keep 
buying food from all over the world 
because industrial agriculture has 
made it so cheap. 

Eating local allows us to re-engage 
with the natural systems of food and 
enrich the environment, rather than 
harm it. Many local farmers take into 
account the seasons for growing cer-
tain crops and enrich biodiversity by 
growing a variety of produce. While 
the fruits and vegetables (even the 
organic ones) sold at supermarkets are 
picked weeks or months in advance 
and are chosen for how well they’ll 
ship, local produce is usually picked 
right after it’s ripened. But the number 
one reason you should eat local is 
because it’s easy. 

If you want to buy locally grown 
groceries, the Food Co-op in the 
Student Center has provided fresh pro-
duce from local sources since it was 
established in 1978. About 90 percent 
of their produce is from Ocean Beach 
People’s Co-op and UCSD’s Farmers 
Market. There are also many local food 
vendors at UCSD’s Farmers Market, 
held near the Student Services Complex 
every Tuesday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. 

You can eliminate the middleman 
by joining Community Supported 
Agriculture, a group that connects 
farmers with buyers. The inconve-
nience excuse doesn’t cut it anymore 
— they deliver a box of produce to you. 

At UCSD, the Garden of Eden 
Organic Farm delivers to the Great Hall 
every Thursday. The A.S. Local Affairs 
office is working to put out a directory 
that lists local food vendors ranging 
from farmers markets to restaurants.

And if you’re really gung-ho about 
the local growing movement, you can 
join the on-campus efforts for an urban 
farm. The Sustainable Food Project, a 
student organization created last year, 
recently earned approval to start an 
urban farm in Pepper Canyon, which 
will underscore the need to eat locally 
and organically and provide practical 
knowledge on how to grow food in 
urban and suburban environments.

Food is such an essential part of our 
everyday lives that taking a moment to 
taste something locally grown should 
be a priority for everyone.

The UC system has 
taken a massive 
budgetary blow this 
year and efforts to 
make ends meet 
have ranged from an 
executive pay freeze to 
shrinking on-campus 
programs. Still, the 
regents will consider a 
9.3 percent increase 
in systemwide student 
fees next month. Here’s 
a look at the pros and 
cons of other recently 
proposed long-term 
plans that might help 
lighten the fiscal load.

CUTTING
UNIVERSITY
COSTS

Desperate times call for desperate measures, like Proposition 1A — and in light of the University 
of California’s $450 million budgetary deficit, it’s safe to 
say that we’re presently in a state of grave desperation. 
Fact is, no one really likes paying higher taxes, but when 
it can help prevent future budgetary crises like the one 
we currently face, we’ve got to suck it up for a while 
(Proposition 1A calls for the extension of current tax 
increases for up to two years) and fork over the cash in 
the interest of preserving higher education. 

If it passes, following the statewide special election 
on May 19, Proposition 1A would more than double the 
size of the state’s rainy-day reserve fund and restrict state 
spending — resulting in a more stable state economy 
(i.e. a state economy that won’t be forced to cut fund-
ing to the UC system to alleviate its own debt). Some 
opponents of the measure say it cuts too much spending, 
and some say it cuts too little. But in reality, the proposi-
tion, fittingly dubbed the Budget Stabilization Act, will 
do just what California higher education needs: Restore 
university access to sufficient state funding, so that UC 
campuses aren’t forced to rush into destabilizing our 
university with drastic cost-saving measures like those 
we are currently enforcing.

— Trevor Cox
Associate Opinion Editor

ENDORSING PROPOSITION 1A

A recently authorized cost-saving proposal stands to save the UC millions — without cutting services 
or enrollment. Rather, the program will provide savings 
through increased energy efficiency, aiding both the uni-
versity’s thinning wallet and the environment.

Increasing energy efficiency will result in an estimated 
$36 million in annual operational savings for the uni-
versity and would untie funds for other necessities, such 
as building maintenance, that take a backseat to keeping 
the lights on. Because this program decreases university 
dependence on outside electricity sources by 11 percent, 
we’ll be writing energy companies smaller checks at the 
end of the month, allowing us to use our savings elsewhere.

Though $178 million of the total projected cost of  
$247.4 million will have to be financed through 15-year 
revenue bonds, the program’s $36 million annual savings 
will be used to pay for the debt itself.

The renovations at UCSD may include solar panel 
installations, a shift to L.E.D. lighting and improving air 
conditioning systems, providing students with cleaner and 
more efficient air flow in facilities. Although costly, by 
committing to these improvements the university will gain 
financial security while moving toward its sustainability 
goals to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions back to 2000 
levels by 2014 and 1990 levels by 2020.

THURSDAY, APRIL 9, 2009 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

Dear Editor,
Based upon our review of the Web 

sites created by A.S. presidential can-
didate Utsav Gupta and the Student 
Voice! slate, we argue that the SV! 
slate has committed an act of plagia-
rism outside of the classroom setting 
that negatively impacts Gupta’s cam-
paign as well as the election’s fairness.

In addition to the use of the 
“image slideshow and the pop-up 
text” feature on the main page and 
the use of the term “uncage Sun God,” 
SV! also used the same two images 
Gupta used in his Web site to address 
the following issues: 1) to stop tuition 
increases and 2) to enhance our free-
speech right on campus with the 
image of the red arrow and the image 
of the United States, respectively.

We have the opportunity in this 
case to address the issue of plagia-
rism beyond the classroom setting 
and display the intolerance for such 
an activity on behalf of the student 
body. We ask the appropriate A.S. 
officials to support the need for such 
changes in the A.S. election code in 
order to better address this issue in 
future elections.

Dear Editor,
The Guardian has done a great 

disservice to the UCSD academic com-
munity with Michelle Chin’s March 9 
article and its lurid headline: “In Effort 
to Stop Cheating, Process Cheats 
Students.” I write as someone who 
served a three year stint (2005-08) as 
a standing member of the Academic 
Dishonesty Hearing Board, during 
which I participated in many dozens 

of cases. The article does not accurately 
describe the process that I came to 
know. In these inquiries, the panel — 
consisting of faculty, undergraduates
and graduate students, in meetings 
that were chaired by deans from the 
colleges — deliberated long and hard 
about every case. Accused students, 
usually accompanied by student advo-
cates, were given every opportunity to 
present their sides of the issue. Those 
bringing the charges were always made 
to prove their case, usually with con-
siderable printed material, and often 
with witnesses. And although, accord-
ing to the rules, only a majority of the 
panel is needed to decide a case, in my 
experience the verdicts, guilty or not, 
were almost always unanimous. 

Cheating is not a “victimless 
crime.” Those who are hurt are the 
honest majority of students whose 
standing will always be penalized in 
a grade-conscious society. As is true 
on all college campuses, cheating does 
occur at UCSD. Finding fair and hon-
est ways to deal with it has been a 
chronic problem since the campus’s 
founding. The current approach has 
been a distinct improvement over the 
situation of just a few years ago. In 
my judgment, the present academic 
integrity coordinator, Tricia Bertram 
Gallant, is doing an outstanding job 
and deserves the praise of the student 
body, not scurrilous comments from 
the A.S. Office of Student Advocacy.

Academic Dishonesty 
Board Advocates Fairness

California’s budget crisis has reached full force, and every sector is facing serious crunch time. From 
infrastructure management to public education — 
including here at the University of California — we’re 
all feeling the burn of the state’s multibillion-dollar 
cash shortage, forcing Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to 
implement mandatory leaves of absence for many state 
workers in an effort to cut down on spending.

While unpopular (Department of Motor Vehicles 
closures, for example, have increased waiting periods 
in an already hellish establishment) and oftentimes 
annoying, such measures must be enacted to prevent 
the deficit from ballooning any further. Within the 
UC system, President Mark G. Yudof has proposed 
that staff begin developing a framework of policies and 
procedures to be used to institute unpaid leaves and 
salary freezes should they become necessary to sustain 
university operations — a precautionary measure at 

this point, but vital considering the Legislature has 
indicated it will not be able to honor, to the tune of 
several million dollars, the university’s full 2009-10 
funding request.

Yudof ’s plan has created uneasiness within many 
departments as staff members begin designing fur-
lough protocols. Should they become unavoidable, 
students must be ready to brace for a potentially large 
impact on services as the university temporarily ceases 
certain operations, because work becomes backlogged 
when offices close their doors. If required leaves do 
become a reality, however inconvenient, they might just 
teach the university a big, fat lesson: responsible fiscal 
management — via consolidation of programs, ending 
exorbitant salary hikes — must be the top priority at all 
times, not just during state budget crises.

“Sugar”

After drumming up festival fandom 
at Sundance, “Sugar” gleaned another 
round of applause when it drew elated 
reviews for managing to pump a sports 
film with electric sensitivity. Bent through 
the prism of Miguel “Sugar” Santos’ life 
– that of a pitcher from the Dominican 
Republic scaling socioeconomic rungs 
with his curveball – Anna Boden and Ryan 
Fleck (“Half Nelson”) narrate one man’s 
struggles in the fiercely competitive 
world of baseball, painting an American 
landscape soiled with sweat, alienation 
and discrimination. (EG)

(or perhaps as a pinchable ’80s 
starlet), Jenny Lewis broke from 
premeditated, over-saturated pop

take on country twang and gospel 
— the kind of joyful vigor that 
translates well to any stage. (SM)

HOUSE OF BLUES / APRIL 9 / 8 P.M. / $18

Japanese-American artist 
Rachael Yamagata lauched her solo 
career in 2002 with Happenstance 
— after six years writing for 
Chicago funk-fusion band Bumpus. 
And thank God she did — her 
latest, the pop-driven Elephants... 
Teeth Sinking Into Heart, layers 
woodwinds with crushing, complex 
lyrics, proving indisputably that 
this singer/songwriter can stand on 
her own. (SM)

F ollowing part two’s energetic romp, “Shaking Tokyo” — directed by Bong Joon-ho — sinks the series with a lethargic and predictable 
commentary on technology in contemporary society. 
A Japanese hermit (or hikikomori) who’s been 
burrowed in his apartment for a decade makes sudden 
eye contact with a pizza girl and — in a moment of 
true magic — the Earth begins quaking. After she 
faints, the hermit presses a tattooed power button 
on her leg to revive her. After a contemplative inner 
struggle, he decides to pursue her, soon realizing 
Tokyo’s streets have been abandoned so that only 
pizza-delivery robots remain. When he finally arrives 
at her front door, the hermit pushes her ‘love’ button, 
and once again Tokyo begins to tremble. Joon-ho’s 
neatly packaged romance and his obvious critique of 
our generation’s widening isolation is too transparent 
— and weird — to embrace. 

FRIENDLY FIRES

ONE FUNK-PUNK, NU-RAVE REASON TO EMBRACE THE BRITISH

CONCERT PREVIEW

COurTesy OF Xl

Allie Cuerdo
Associate Hiatus Editor 

M eet Ed, Edd and Jack, the three bois-terous Brits behind Friendly Fires. Along with a host of screenprint-ready 
photo shoots (read: posing on a blank wall with 
Sharpied-on headphones) and triangle-patterned 
tote bags (note: the red triangle respresents fire), 
the band boasts a catalog of — 13 tracks. Total. 
Well, if they’re good enough for Coachella… 

Hailing from St. Albans, Hertfordshire, the 
boys’ self-titled debut peaked at No. 38 on the UK 
Albums Chart. Ultra-danceable, slippery synths 
and rapid, street-funk sampling soon caught the 
attention of the television conglomerate: The 
campy, hip-thrusting “White Diamonds” landed a 
spot on an episode of sex-fest “Gossip Girl,” while 
the treadmill-ready beats of “On Board” sweated 
through a Wii Fit commercial.

It’s all perfectly profitable, but that’s the issue: 
Longevity isn’t an option when, after three plays, 
an album is only fit for Guantanamo torture tapes.

But on first listen — and possibly in a concert 
with a hundred sweaty bodies writhing around 
you — their epic MGMT escalades are bloody 
amazing.

At least four of Friendly Fires’ 10 tracks fit right 
in on the American Apparel dance floor. “Jump in 

the Pool,” for instance, attacks visceral sensations 
like (the ever-popular) Ecstasy. Imagine bongo 
drums pounded at 90 mph, exploding dreamboat 
synths and a sexy British man telling you over and 
over to jump in the pool. Pretty righteous.

Then there’s “Paris,” whose relentless break-
beats and lead singer Ed McFarlane’s starry-eyed 
promises — “Every night, the city lights/ Will be 
out for us” — will make you want to drop all your 
classes and buy a plane ticket with next quarter’s 
tuition funds.

Besides, Friendly Fires have been practic-
ing. To complement their ultra-produced studio 
gems, the band’s live persona garnered enough 
attention for a spot on the 2009 NME tour with 
Glasvegas, and a slot at the Indio mega-concert 
with the Cure. 

In a UGO interview, lead singer McFarlane 
said that when they first assembled 10 years ago, 
they “played like shit” at a birthday party and were 
eventually shut down in favor of “DJ Spunky.” 
Guitarist Jack Savidge didn’t even know how to 
play the guitar. Fortunately, Friendly Fires learned 
a couple chords, transforming from ultimate 
suckage to sampling suckers. And really, what 
does your Wednesday night look like without 
them? 

Friendly Fires will perform live at the Loft on 
April 15 at 7:30 p.m. 

W hether getting slapped with an NC-17 rating is snaps for an envelope-torching maverick or just a 
publicity ploy to promote his cutting-edge 
comedy, it certainly has turned us into a 
bunch of rubberneckers. 

In case you haven’t yet caught eye of the 
red-band trailer in vogue, “Brüno” makes 
“Zoolander” look safer than seat belts. 

Sacha Baron Cohen’s definitely 
mastered puckish orchestrations of 
culturally insensitive pranks in heavily 
accented improv — and curved through 
a European lithp, his two-and-a-half 
minute trailer pedals “Chappelle’s Show” 
on rainbow steroids. 

Aside from fashion-forward cut-offs 
and Milanese logos, it’s the same old 
shtick: Foreign reporter comes stateside, 
seeking acceptance, but mostly just turns 
a candid camera on our less than attractive 
American culture. But after a two year 
interim, Cohen’s learned to pilot his 
tomfoolery to transgressive heights — or 
amoral lows, depending on how much

Panoramic
Sleights An eccentric tale spun by “Eternal Sunshine” mastermind Michel Gondry, “Design” trails a young couple facing the 

big-city obstacles of their new hometown: no park-
ing, an endless apartment hunt and dwindling cash. 

The boyfriend (Satoshi Tsumabuki) is an aspir-
ing director, but his experimental sci-fi film-with-
in-a-film — which nearly suffocates its audience 
with a supplemental fog machine — doesn’t make 
it past a modest opening at a local seedy porno 
theater. As their pockets continue to empty, the 
girlfriend (Ayako Fujitani, Steven Seagal’s daugh-
ter) feels alienated by her own lack of ambition. 

Kafka would be proud of the metamorphosis 
that ensues: Fujitani awakens one morning to find 
her rib cage mutating into a chair’s wooden pillars. 
After a dramatic dash through Tokyo’s isolating 
backdrop, she completes her transformation into 
chair, soon snatched up by a passing musician. 

Fujitani ultimately finds solace in her simple 
utility. Though we’re wooed by her new wood-
en occupation and artsy attitude, her welcoming 
embrace of chair-dom is almost too sudden to 
make sense; in the end, even the biggest/most 
intense identity crisis doesn’t seem to justify choos-
ing a painstakingly simple existence just to avoid a 
couple of rent bills. 

U p next is Leos Carax’s “Merde,” which translates to “shit” in French. Playing off the old-school “Godzilla” ram-
pages of which Tokyo is so fond (and with a 
soundtrack to match), the film focuses on sewer-
dwelling Merde (Dennis Lavant), who surfaces 
to torment the city — stealing cigarettes, eating 
flowers and licking women. 

Finally, after discovering some grenades in 
the sewers and throwing them into a busy inter-
section, he’s arrested and put on trial. 

“Merde” is the both strangest and the stron-
gest of the bunch, thanks to Carax’s attention 
to bizarre aesthetic detail and character quirks: 
We savor the sensory costumes (Merde’s green 
corduroy suit and swirly red hair) and strange 
body language. A shaky camera captures Merde’s 
chaotic rampage, while extended close-ups of his 
disfigured face force us to confront the outcast’s 
raw and unforgiving prank-terrorism. 

Carax goes overboard with an exhausting 
10 minute conversation in Merde’s imaginary 
language, but by the time the death sentence 
rolls around, we know the pariah so well that 
we’re all rooting for his survival. He may be the 
shit of society, but he’s our shit and we want to 
keep him. 

“INTERIOR DESIGN” “MERDE” “SHAKING TOKYO”

A ny local will tell you that a postcard or flashy tourist 
tchotchke doesn’t embody a 
city’s real heart and soul. Still, 
its reputation can’t escape an 
outsider’s bias, and it’s all too 
easy to notice that “Tokyo!” 
— a triptych of shorts filmed 
in Japan’s neon-drenched 
capital — was written and 
directed by three non-natives. 
However disjointed the fan-
tastical set of films, it’s got 
nothing on its marginalized 
protagonists: It’s them versus 
the city, and the rules of reality 
don’t apply.

comedic leg room you give the guy.
At least, that was the consensus when it screened at SXWS and 

ruffled enough feathers to make some critics say it made “Borat”’s nude 
scenes look like “child’s play.”

Now that we’re all good and familiar with his asinine aesthetic and 
soft-core sensibilities, it’s not surprising that “Brüno” is already being 
hell-hounded. But what might be, is the fact that it’s being stood behind 
confidently by the cash-money millionaires at Universal.

While Paramount may have been the first to take a limp lance at the 
oft-ostentatious world of diet pills and textile — “Zoolander” matched 
kid-gloved satire with twice as much slapstick — it opted to spare our 
feelings and stick within PC perforations. I flip past it every time it’s 
looped on TBS, rather than soap box anything remotely easy to critque.

Accordinigly, Kubrick might have been able to ride Columbia with 
“Dr. Strangelove,” but it’s only because half the humor was armor-plated 
in phallic symbols and Peter Sellers. Most satires have to learn to stay 
afloat without a studio and material likely to offend someone.

Waiving studio funds in order to protect their right to effectively 
piss off who ever they wanted, satirists like Robert Downey Sr. and 
Ralph Bakshi fastened their lampoons to irreverent plots in the ’60s and 
’70s. As one of my favorite films from a decade alchemizing economic 
crisis into cinema’s golden age, “Putney Swope” imagined what would 
happen if black militants rubbed shoulders with Madison Avenue in 
an advertising agency takeover — then slammed it with jive, jazz and 
product placement. 

“Fritz the Cat” did much of the same. Animating a tabby arguably 
hornier than comic-book creator R. Crumb, Bakshi told the X-rated saga 
of a “sophisticated, up-to-the-minute feline college student.” Watching 
Fritz relish in the frisky free-love movement while experimenting with 
drugs, riots and group sex, it isn’t difficult to understand why post-
menopausal audiences were swift to cry bestiality, though younger ones 
generally perceived the political subtext. After all, it was an idealized era 
in which everyone liked to think of themselves as an artists who hated 
Jesus;. the more low-budget and self-made the project, the more edgy, 
contemporary and poisonously caustic.  

What people seem to forget is that Cohen’s inherited comedy — 
for all its misappropriated attention and exaggerated color — holds a 
mirror to petrified ideologies anchored in America’s blind spots. And 
while I’m sure it won’t stick to a stringent skeleton of social satire, 
“Brüno” looks to glean most of its commentary from our obsession with 
the tabloids, Bible-belt homophobia and suburban S&M.  

The most unfortunate turn of news though isn’t that “Brüno” still has 
to wait three months until opening, but that most of the time, satire can 
still be so misunderstood — either by those finding it overtly offensive or 
by viewers who merely reaffirm their prejudices with every joke. 

Let’s just hope Cohen doesn’t run off to Africa at the height of his 
career — for his sake and ours.

AGE
L.A.’S LOUDEST NOISE-POPPERS GIFT SOME STINK TO OUR STERILE

CONCERT PREVIEW

NO
By Simone Wilson
Senior Staff Writer 

T he Loft is to the Smell (the downtown Los Angeles venue where No Age like to nest) as Whole Foods is to your lopsided vegetable garden out back. The Loft looks like Espresso Roma after an Ikea shopping 
spree on St. Patrick’s Day; the Smell looks like your hip little 
sister’s first art show. The Loft smells like Burger King and 
Pinesol; the Smell is the fucking smell. The Loft sounds like a 
live, tinkling stream of indie-pusses pissing — but not for long. 

For old-fashioned scenesters — the type that would cut off 
an arm to have gotten trashed to Patti Smith at CBGB — the 
new wave of ruckusy, fun-loving Los Angeles punk emanat-
ing from the Smell is a modern-day miracle, its smalltime 
shoulder-to-shoulder standing space just what the digital age 
was mostly missing.

Indeed, the ex-supermercado lean-to is breeding the most 
inspired bunch of musical lifestylers on the Left Coast, and — 
all bias aside — pretty much puts L.A. one big cool-point above 
San Francisco.

But these punks are a cleaner mess than the spikey devil-
worshippers of yore; they like white space, and poems, and the 
sun. When they say things, they’re not mean, and even semi-
audible. If they want something, they ask for it. And in thanks, 
they ruffle your hair three-dimensionally like you’re just as cute.

Yeah, right.
One thing’s for sure: The phenomenon wouldn’t be half as 

happening without No Age. The multitasking duo was origi-
nally two-thirds of fellow Smell staple Wives, which is prob-
ably how they scored a house key by the second date, and in 
return — as word has it — guitar-half Randy Randall helped 
shovel a second sewage trench under the club to accommodate 
the basic needs of an exploding punk family. Even New Yorker 
granny Sasha Frere-Jones stopped by to take notes — and 
post pics on her blog (almost as weird as my mom joining 
Facebook).

Weirdo Rippers, No Age’s 2007 debut LP, was a half-hour, 
11-track “greatest hits” of all the EPs they had distributed 
on the come-up — more just a gathering of anything with a 
semi-recognizable tune sticking out from under their signa-
ture cloud of barbed-wire fuzzballs. (Plastered on the cover 
was a snapshot of the backdoor entrance to the Smell, album 
information painted straight onto the building’s white stuc-
co.) Last year’s Nouns is fuller figured, with noise-pop melo-
dies that lob past chicken scratch into the realm of laptop-
speaker tolerable, meanwhile kicking up more cutting-room 
sawdust with which to clog the speakers than ever before — if 
only for some distant pleasure moan of their vegan-or-die 
tagalong mob. And this Saturday night in Price Center East, 
that could be you, Kid.

No Age will perform live at the Loft on April 11 at 8 p.m.

Gavin DeGraw
■ Free
J-RecoRds

recordings

L ess than a year after his self-titled sophomore smash, radio darling Gavin DeGraw breaks Free. Soulful, stripped-down piano ballads and bluesy (but still 
pretty-boy) vocals mark the intimate album, a far cry 
from last year’s might-as-well-be-Maroon 5 single “In 
Love With A Girl.” With nine other singles behind him 
— notably, the anthemic Billboard Award nominee “I 
Don’t Want To Be” — DeGraw doesn’t need the fame 
anymore. Instead, he opts for inner harmony and a 
healthy dose of self-loathing: a diary’s worth of post-
breakup depression.

DeGraw opts for forgiveness on “Stay,” warbling: “You 
don’t have to be part of the problem/ I just need a second 
chance.” Sparce drums on silken rhythms slice his words 
like paper cuts — and they hurt so deep, don’t you know? 

On “Dancing Shoes,” he piano-keys his sensitivity with 
an occasional stroke of soft flute or broken ivory jangles. 
Accompanying lyrics “Rush me/ But leave time to wait” 
are stupid in comparison. Fortunately, DeGraw compen-
sates with an acute acoustic sensibility for the next few 
tracks, easing up for an organic sincerity that offsets his 
sometimes sobby poetry.

Bare production figures big on Free, a hefty improve-
ment from his previously polished hits. It’s an important 
lesson: Even honey-dipped vocals and emotional hair 
flips can be served with clever competence. In this senti-
mental reincarnation, DeGraw’s got just enough to pass.

Yeah Yeah Yeahs
■ It’s Blitz!
InteRscope

K aren O is back — as the Black Widow? Seems like everybody’s getting an alter-ego these days (shout-out to Sasha Fierce). But somehow, even when Ms. O’s 
decked out in spider-web tights and furry tarantula boots, 
we aren’t statisfied. It’s the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and we want 
more. After a two-year hiatus following the Is Is EP, New 
York’s finest shoot sky-high with the deliciously dancey It’s 
Blitz!, packed with garage-punk thrashing and ’80s synth 
backing to pave a new era of YYY party rock. 

The band grimes it up, getting down and dirty with O’s 
blasting fever-queen vocals. First single “Zero” begins with 
a clear-cut demand: “Get your leather on.” What could be 
more rock ‘n’ roll than that? Stadium synths climb above 
sensual lyrics, racing to a jostling, crowd-rushed release. On 
“Dull Life,” train echoes and resonant “Maps”-like vocals 
slide into shattered chorus-verse duels. 

Hard riffs switch on O’s screams, only to give way to the 

heartbreakingly gentle, “We see the nightmare of your lies.” 
She’s so expressive we could cry — but then all’s washed 
clean with the indie romance of “Hysteric.” The soft-smile 
sentiment “You suddenly complete me” flips “Hey There 
Delilah” the bird; this is a love song for the dreamy, tattooed 
art punks (still not too far from chart-topping success). 

No doubt, It’s Blitz! packs a dazzling electric punch. 
With sold-out audiences in London and a sub-headline 
after the Cure at Coachella, YYY need no more prompting 
for a full-scale U.S. tour. (Plus, Karen O once apparently 
danced off the stage and into the hospital — that’s how hard 
these kids play.) So let’s bring them home. Yeah Yeah Yeahs 
for Sun God 2010!

Yeah Yeah Yeahs will play live at Coachella on April 19.

thursday, april 9, 2009 the uCsd Guardian sports  11

goals, but sophomore utility Nadine 
Shnayderman scored her second goal 
of the game to give the Tritons the 
lead for good. In the fourth quarter, 
senior captain Sydney Gstettenbauer 
and freshman hole set Kirsten Bates 
sealed the 8-7 Triton victory.

“It felt good to get some division 
wins,” Sanders said. “We know where 
we stand in our division and it felt 
good to see how our competition will 
play out.”

In Saturday’s action, Gstettenbauer 
carried the Tritons in their victory 
over Sonoma State in a tight game. 
The Tritons held a slight advantage in 
the high-scoring first half, but couldn’t 
pull away for a substantial advantage, 
ending the half with a 5-4 lead. 

In the third, Gstettenbauer scored 
to give the Tritons a two-goal lead, but 
the Seawolves returned the favor to cut 
their deficit back to one. Gstettenbauer 
once again had an answer, scoring 
what proved to be the game winner 
early in the fourth quarter.

“This will affect our seeding in the 

conference tournament and it has an 
impact on who we play in the future,” 
Heinrich said.

In their first game of the tourna-
ment, the Tritons were not ready for 
what San Jose State was bringing, and 
fell behind 5-1 in the first quarter.

“We just didn’t expect what hap-
pened,” Heinrich said. “They came out 
fast and we just tried to catch up.”  

The game could have easily turned 
into disaster after the appalling first 
quarter, but UCSD came out more 
prepared in the second quarter after 
seeing the Spartans’ potential. The 
Tritons scored six times in the sec-
ond quarter and drew the game into 
manageable terrain, trailing 10-7 at 
halftime.

“We mixed up our defense and 
were prepared for what they were 
doing in the second quarter,” Heinrich 
said.

Heinrich went on a scoring frenzy 
in the game, scoring two of the Tritons 
goals in the second and taking four 
goals overall in the game. Despite her 
impressive performance, the Triton 

defense could not contain the Spartans 
attack force at any point in the game 
— giving up a six-goal third quarter 
— while the Triton offense could only 
score twice, as San Jose State took 
a demanding 16-9 lead into the last 
period, swimming away with a final 
17-11 victory. 

“We still need to fix some things 
and improve for the future,” junior 
goalkeeper Markayla Quane said. “We 
have more conference games coming 
up so we need to get better for those.”

The Tritons face off against con-
ference rival Loyola Marymount 
University tonight at Canyonview Pool 
at 6 p.m. With a victory, the Tritons 
could shake up the conference stand-
ings and build up heavy steam heading 
into the playoffs on April 25.

“We’re ranked fourth in our con-
ference and they’re ranked second, so 
we’ll have to play hard to beat them,” 
Sanders said. “It all comes down to 
who wants it more.”

or when they take you away from 
something you can no longer deal 
with. Sports have power, sports have 
impact, and with all of those fans who 
were so jacked up with love of a sport 
and pride for their team at the WBC, 
the feeling was revitalizing and conta-
gious — like body wash that gives you 
pink-eye, but in a good way.

The pride shown by the fans in 
attendance, and disdain shown for 
the WBC by many Americans who 
think only USA-dominated sports or 
tournaments matter, reminded me 
of UCSD. A lot of people said they 
would have watched the WBC finals 
had Team USA been in contention. 
Similarly, a lot of people say that 

UCSD needs a football team, and 
then they’d go to all the games. Here’s 
the thing: even without Team USA, 
an amazing game was played and 
those who watched as the Koreans 
battled to tie the game in the ninth 
only for Japan to defend its WBC 
crown in extra innings got far more 
than their money’s worth. In the same 
way, UCSD might not have a football 
team, but we have a women’s basket-
ball team that returned to the NCAA 
Tournament, a men’s basketball team 
that deserved an NCAA spot, a base-
ball team that swept the top-ranked 
squad in the country and a crap-load 
of other teams that are often battling, 
and beating, Division-I opponents. 
Sure, one day a football team will be 

nice, but reasonable people under-
stand that it is not feasible right now. 
One day UCSD might get a football 
team, one day they might move up to 
Division I. In the mean time, rather 
than waiting, bitching and envision-
ing a competitive Triton World of 
Warcraft or late-night study team, 
there are games going on and teams 
to support and take pride in.

I’m not sure I’ll get to see or feel 
the same sense of pride I witnessed at 
the WBC, but I guess that’s the reason 
I watch a lot of sports, spend far too 
much money going to games and 
have this intense connection to some-
thing that might be pretty trivial: the 
off-chance that I might again get to 
see something that is truly classic.

THURSDAY, APRIL 9, 2009

The freshman allowed just two runs 
against University of  Hawaii-Hilo in the 

Tournament of  Champions Bronze Bracket 
title game, earning her fifth victory.

By Janani Sridharan
Sports Editor

BASEBALL — The No. 6 Tritons near-
ly came back from a six-run deficit to 
sweep the Wildcats last weekend, but 
had to settle for one loss in the four-
game set, ending their winning streak 
at 12 games but successfully taking 
their third straight series. UCSD will 
stay on the road against Grand Canyon 
University this weekend, attempting to 
take another four-game set.

After winning all eight games at 
home, the first-place Tritons traveled 
to Chico State April 3 to April 5. The 
first two games were all offense — 
UCSD won by scores of 19-8 and 10-8 
— before the Tritons took the back end 
of Saturday’s doubleheader 5-3. 

“You can’t take anything away from 
Chico’s pitchers — their pitching really 
wasn’t bad,” junior catcher Kellen Lee 
said. “We just had an offensive explo-
sion and took advantage of any bad 
pitches they made.”

Sunday’s series finale saw the 
Tritons in a large hole early on. Holding 
on to a 2-1 lead, the Wildcats broke the 
game open in the bottom of the fifth 
with two outs. Against junior starting 
pitcher Kirby St. John, the Wildcats 
put runners on first and third with one 
out in the inning. Senior rightie Ryland 
MacFadyen came in as relief for St. 
John and promptly struck out the first 
Chico State batter he faced for the sec-
ond out. Almost out of the inning, the 
Triton reliever walked the next batter, 
loading the bases. 

Chico State then singled in two 
runs and the Wildcats put a runner 

on third after a Triton throwing error. 
A wild pitch by MacFadyen added an 
unearned run for the Wildcats, giving 
them a 5-1 lead entering the sixth. 

Junior outfielder Robert Sedin 
drove in a run for the Tritons in the top 
of the sixth, but the Wildcats scored 
three more runs off two UCSD reliev-
ers in the bottom half of the inning to 
extend their lead to 8-2. Even when 
they were down by six runs, the Tritons 
never felt like they were out of the 
game.

“Our offense has been doing a 
great job and they never give up,” 
MacFadyen said. “They always punch 

back and never stop competing.”
 UCSD fought back in the top of the 

seventh, taking advantage of two Chico 
State errors to load the bases with one 
out. A single from senior first baseman 
Matt Cantele and a sac fly from red-
shirt junior Brandon Gregorich scored 
two runs for UCSD before senior out-
fielder Nick Burke’s two-run double 
capped the four-run inning.

UCSD was unable to make up the 
two-run deficit, however, succumbing 
to Chico State 8-6. Still, the Tritons 
came out of Chico State retaining their 
No. 6 ranking and pulling off another 
series win.

“Obviously it was too little too late,” 
Lee said of the attempted comeback 
in the final game. “But we fought and 
scratched back to make it 8-6. If we 
came out strong like we did in the other 
games, I think we would have won.”

With a 22-8 record (19-5 California 
Collegiate Athletic Association), the 
Tritons are in first place, three games 
ahead of Sonoma State University. 
UCSD continues its road trip against 
regional opponent Grand Canyon, 
with the first pitch tonight at 7 p.m.

TRITONS TAKE THIRD STRAIGHT SERIES WIN

Unusual ‘Kick 
Assist’ Lands 

Tritons a Spot 
on SportsCenter 

By Janani Sridharan

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — The 
No. 10 Tritons were victim to a 
bizarre play in their four-game 
loss to No. 5 Stanford University 
last weekend, but at least they got 
some airtime out of it.

During the match, the 
Cardinal dug out what looked to 
be a Triton kill before Stanford 
defensive specialist Erik Shoji set 
up a Cardinal score with what 
ESPN’s SportsCenter called a 
“kick assist.”

Just like it sounds, Shoji kicked 
the ball up right before it hit the 
ground, allowing his teammate 
to send down a kill, causing the 
Stanford faithful in attendance at 
RIMAC Arena into a frenzy.

Sophomore middle blocker 
Calvin Ross, who was on the bench 
at the time of the play, wasn’t even 
sure what had occured.

“All I knew was something 
really crazy happened because of 
the way the other team reacted, 
but I couldn’t really see it,” he said.

The play took the No. 2 spot 
on SportsCenter’s April 7 top 10 
plays of the day, garnering atten-
tion from ESPN for an NCAA 
sport that generally goes unno-
ticed. More impressively, it beat 
out all but one play from Major 
League Baseball’s opening day. 

UCSD goes up against No. 3 
Cal State Northridge on April 10 
at 7 p.m. in RIMAC Arena.

The second-ever World Baseball Classic came to a conclusion on March 23, and 
for most Americans, the event elic-
ited as much excitement as an Utsav 
Gupta campaign speech (more excit-
ing than paint drying, less exciting 
than “Tyler Perry’s House of Payne” 
marathon). The finals of the event, 
taking place at Dodger Stadium in 
Los Angeles, featured the defend-
ing champion Team Japan facing the 
Korean squad. For many living in the 
nation where the finals were taking 
place, the WBC had come to an end 
right after Team USA’s elimination in 
the semifinals. Others probably gave 
up on the event in 2006, when Team 
USA was eliminated even earlier and 
thus leading some to say the entire 
thing didn’t matter.

Sitting at the WBC finals, sur-
rounded by true fans of the Japanese 
and Korean teams, it become crystal 
clear that even without Team USA, the 
classic did matter. It mattered to every 
single player on that field and to the 
fans that put all their faith and hope in 
to a team representing their heritage.

I’ve been to a lot of baseball games 
in my life. I spent two weeks after my 
freshman year driving through 11 dif-
ferent states and seeing games at seven 
different stadiums. I love baseball, 
and in that sense, I’m partially biased 
toward the WBC. Many who are able 
to tolerate a basketball or football 
game look at the intricacies of baseball 
and would prefer to watch the Hayden 
Christiansen film “Jumper” (warning: 
do not attempt to watch “Jumper”). 
Nonetheless, the atmosphere of the 
WBC rivaled any sporting atmosphere 
I have ever been a part of. The game 
itself was played so well that you got 
to see exactly why these two teams, 
and not the disjointed USA squad, 
made the finals. You could under-
stand why they deserved a chance to 
be deemed the real World Champion. 
Seeing baseball played the way it really 
should be played, it was blatantly obvi-
ous that either of these teams, com-
prised mostly of non-MLB players, 
would be at the very least a playoff 
contender in the Major Leagues.

The palpable difference between 
the finals of this year’s WBC and 
other events I’ve attended — includ-
ing the 2006 WBC semifinals and 
finals — was the intense and unshak-
able pride on each side of the aisle. 
Fans cared about their teams to the 
same degree that parents say they 
care about their children; specifi-
cally the child they actually like and 
not just the one they tolerate, lie 
to and then show their disdain for 
through crappy gift-giving (thanks 
for the birthday socks, mom and 
dad). Seeing people care so much and 
align themselves so completely with a 
team is the greatest reminder of the 
power and impact of sports.

Why are there 24-hour channels 
dedicated only to sports? Why do 
people propose marriage inside a sta-
dium? Why are there so many chil-
dren and pets named after athletes? 
Why are people able to connect so 
quickly over a team or a game? 

Sports matter, in times of excite-
ment and exhilaration, in times 
of loss and defeat, when they give 
you something to look forward to, 

CLASSIC, IN 
EVERY SENSE 
OF THE WORD

UCSD Breaks Even at Santa Clara Tourney

WATER POLO — It was another tough 
weekend, featuring fierce competi-
tion and arduous feats for the UCSD 
women’s water polo team. The Tritons 
played in the Santa Clara Invitational 
Tournament, where they faced off 
against the likes of No. 6 San Jose State 
and conference opponents Sonoma 
State, Colorado State and Santa Clara 
University during a two-day event. The 
Tritons experienced varied levels of 
success and defeat in the tournament 
and emerged with a 2-2 record, bring-
ing their season record to 9-16. The 
Tritons dropped an early match to San 
Jose State 11-17, but defeated Sonoma 
State later that day 7-6. On Sunday, the 
Tritons defeated Colorado State 8-7, 
but fell prey to the host Santa Clara 
Broncos, 10-7.

In their most recent match, the 
Tritons dueled the Broncos in a tight 

contest; neither team was capable of 
breaking free. The Tritons were down 
2-1 after the first quarter and 5-4 at the 
half, but after a quick halftime pep talk 
the Tritons stormed back. The teams 
continued to battle vigorously for posi-
tion through the third quarter, relying 
on outside shooting. 

After scoring to take the lead at 
the end of the third, the Broncos con-
verted two unanswered goals to break 
out of the fourth and the Tritons were 
unable to recover from the brief lapse 
in judgment to make up the deficit. 
The Tritons’ top two hole set defenders 
received majors nearing the end of the 
game, forcing them to be kicked out 
of the game. The Broncos won 10-7 to 
close the tournament for the Tritons in 
a tight game in which the Tritons yet 
again faltered.

“We lost our two main two-meter 
defenders and we had to make due 
from there,” head coach Larry Sanders 
said. “We really didn’t have great mid-

dle presence when our two defenders 
were kicked out.”

The Tritons did experience some 
success on Sunday in their encounter 
with the Colorado State Rams. In the 
matchup with their out-of-state con-
ference opponent, the Tritons were tied 
2-2 with the Rams at halftime, and the 
scoring was just getting started. 

The Tritons allowed the first goal 
and fell behind 3-2, but were wary of 
their second-half falters in past per-
formances and sought to curb those 
tendencies. Junior utility Stephanie 
Heinrich scored two unanswered 
goals to give the Tritons a 4-3 lead 
halfway through the third quarter, 
and freshman attacker Jessica Tran 
scored less than one minute later to 
give UCSD the largest lead of the 
game in this highly contested match. 
Colorado State fought back to tie the 
game with two immediate unanswered

Over the last 10 games, the No. 20 Tritons were unable to put together a string wins, going 5-5 against a medley of ranked and unranked squads.
