Muir College Coup Staged, 
New Government May be Forme 

A coup, of sorts, has been 
pulled off at Muir College. In 
a rather suprising move Wednes-
day night, especially to Deans 
Batchelder and Pile, the Muir 
College (Dorm) Presidents 
Council declared itself to be 
the student government of Muir 
College. 

Val Quoidbach, the nominal 
head of the Dorm Council pre-
pared a statement to this effect 
earlier in the day. At the even-
ing meeting the statement was 
passed, with only one dissenting 
vote--a dorm vice-president. 
However, it was substantially 
modified immediately atter its 
ratification. 

Muir College last year set 
up a provisional government con-
sisting of committees charged 
with various functions. Near 
the end of last year this structure 
dissolved, and the responsibility 
of government handed over to 

rnA SANDPEARL, long a close 
political associate of Joan Baez, 
spoke here Sunday night. His 
basic message was that "the 
worth of an individual transcends 
the right of the state to take 
his life." Sandperl, whose lec-
ture was sponsored by Friends 
of the Resistance, is director 
of the Western Institute of Non-
violent Studies. 

DECLARATION OF INTENTS 
AND PURPOSES 

As a student-elected organ-
ization of Muir College, the Muir 
College Presidents Council dec-
lares itself to be the student 
government of Muir College. 

This government will be 
composed of resident hall presi-
dents and the chairman of the 
cultural affairs committee. Com 
muter s will be represented in 
equal number through a Muir 
College commuters organization. 

This government will deter-
mine what offices are necessary 
to its operation, and will deter-
mine officers in an appropriate 
manner. 

Our purpose will be to co-
ordinate student affairs of John 
Muir College, to present affairs 
of student concern to the students, 
to stimulate student-faculty-ad-
ministration interaction, to im-
prove the quality of life within 
the college, to provide for adi-
tional interaction between the 
the resident and commuting stu-
dents, to provide a vehicle and 
direction for appropriate student 
expression, and to responsibly 
disburse student funds. 

To this end, we desire to 
utilize those rights , considera-
tions, priveleges, and monies 
due Muir College students. 

Voting rights are limited 
to one vote per council member 
(with a maximum of one vote 
per hall). Voting priveleges 
will be determined and extended 
by the government, and at no 
time will anyone hold veto power

It was partly through Patric's 

efforts that a Bill of Rights 
convention was arranged and con-
vened late last quarte r. However 
the work of the convention was 
interrupted by the Regents meet-
ing. Lack of student participation 
also contributed to its failure. 

This convention was never 
reconvened, and Quoidbach and 
several others became impatient

a government would have to have 
the support of the students. 

Also at stake is a sum of 
money alloted to a Muir College 
government, when formed, by

The structure of the govern-
ment includes representation for 
all Muir dorms. Provisions 
are also made for equal commu-
ter representation. Quoidbach 
requests that all commuter stu-
dents interested in participating

This week the Tr iton Times Xp aIDe y artlel pants 

expands its coverage of state-
Wide, national, and international 
news with the inclusion of articles 
from the College Press Service 
(CPS). This service is some-
what similar to UPI and AP, 
but its emphasis is more upon 
news and feature articles that 
are of direct concern to students. 

CPS is a subsidiary of USSPA, 
the United States Student Press 
Association, which consists of 
some 300 member colleges. CPS 
is a cooperative effort, with each 
member paper contributing copy. 

However, there is a full-time 
staff of two in Washington, and 
one each in New York, San Fran-
cisco and Atlanta. In addition 
there are correspondents in Viet-
nato and other countries. Most 
CPS staff members are recent 
editors of college papers. They 
usually work for one year, after 
graduation or during a year off 
from school. 

CPS's philosophy, as stated in 
their handbook, is as follows: 
" •.. college newspapers are rea-
lizing that their job is not just 
to deal with events and issues 
on their own campuses, but to 
provide their readers with infor-
mation about other campuses and 
about national issues and events 
which affect students, to present 
what happens on their campuses 
in the context of the larger world 
with which most of their readers 
are concerned and involved.' 

Tuesday evening in USB 2622 
a student and a professor involved 
in the San Francisco State strike 
told a UCSD audience what it was 
all about and why it should mean 
something to them.

White strike Support Committee. 
This student committee was 
formed solely to support the 
BSU an Third World Liberation 
Front in their strike, while theo-

Hatfield Bill Would 
Abolish Draft 

WASHINGTON (CPS)-Senator 
Mark Hatfield of Oregon Wednes-
day (Jan. 22) introduced a bill 
that would abolish the draft and 
seek to make the armed forces 
more attractive to potential vol-
unteers. 

Supporters range from con-
servative Barry Goldwater, the 
defeated 1964 Presidential can-
didate just returned to the Senate 
by Arizona voters, to liberal 
George McGovern, who declared 
for President after Robert Ken-
nedy was assassinated last June. 

Senator Hatfield feels this 
spectrum shows the broad basis 
ot support for this bill, but not 
much chance is given on Capitol 
Hill for passage. The pessimism 
is due in part to traditional op-
position to the all-volunteer army 
concept, and also due to the ap-
peal expected for a bill to be 
introduced soon by Senator Ed-
ward Kennedy. The Massachu-

setts Senator seeks to reform 
the draft, not abolish it. 

Senator Hatfield's bill calls 
the present Selective Service 
System an "undesirable infringe-
ment on personal Uberty, mili-
tarUy inefficient, inherently in-
equitable to dratt-age Ameri-
cans, and productive of low mor-
ale in the armed forces." 

Inductions would end six months 
after enactment of the bill, but 
registration would continue so 
the draft could be reinstituted 
in case of national emergency. 

Innovations for the military 
suggested by the bUl include 
adjusting standards so that pre-
sently unqualified persons could 
be accepted and either rehabili-
tated or put in non-combatant 
positions. Civilian personnel 
would be used for office jobs. 
Increased educational benefits 
and pay boost of $100 per month 
tor enlisted men are included in 
the added inducements. 

support. In practice, however, 
the WSSC has never been in 
disagreement with BSU or TWLF 
over tactics. Atter an initial 
period of mutual suspicion aggra-
vated by poor communications, 
the whites and non whites now 
ha ve a real bond. 

Bill stanton, a former 
state legislator, recently denied 
tenure at SFS, represented the 
Teacher's Union which repre-
sents about 400 of the 1100 teach-
ers at SFS. Of those 40U, over 
200 are on str ike. The Union's 
original str ike objectives were 
to force the state to collect-
ively bargain with State College 
teachers and to cause a "reso-
lution of student grievances." 

This second reason, as 
well as the timing. of the teach-
ers' strike caused many students, 
faculty, administration, and es-
pecially state officials to question 
the tr ue motives of the strike, 
and to charge the teaches 
and to charge the teachers with 
using the student strike to their 
own benefit. 

Stanton claimed that the 
reaction of the union to a tem-
porary restraining order, name-
ly, telling the judge where he 
proved the sincerity of his union's 
sympathy with the students (the 
teacher's strike has the official 
support of the San Francisco 
AFL-CIO labor counCil, if not 
the support of the masses of 
labor). 

For stanton, "life is 
simple; there are good guys and 
bad guys." At the base are the 
rich businessmen who, according 
to Stanton, hate students because 
"they are young and have a fan-
tastic sex life." • 

Reagan needs no comment. 
The trustees got to be trustees 
because they were rich business-
men. Mayor Alioto of San 
Francisco is "a neakybastard" 
aiming at higher office. Also 
aiming for power, in Stanton's 
analysis isS. T. Hayakawa, whose 
action while president have been 
to (I)obfuscate issues with rhe-
toric, to (2) claim falsly to 
be sympathetic with student 
strike demand, and to (3) 
call in the police at every op-
portunity. 

What makes these 
demands revolutionary, however, 
is the goal th yare aiming 
toward. The speak rs pointed 
out that the Third World people 
now trained at SFS usually 
adopt the valu of the ystem 
aoo would rath r s th Black 
remain in the gh tto. 

The purpose of the Black-
Third World Department, then, 
would be to train a vanguard of 
militants who would return to the 
ghetto and "bring their brothers 
together." The Blacks have 
known for a long time that a 
few of them could make it by 
adapting to the system, but that 
the only way they cO'lld make 
it as a race would be to adapt 
the system to them. The aim 
of the strikers is to train men 
who will do just that. 

The strikers took the para-
doxical position of closing a 
school they would very much like 
to be open because that is th 
only power they have. Is that 
power enough') They think so, 
partly because they have to, but 
also because they believe thatt 
they can't all be busted. 

Eventually they think the 
nature of the businessmen who 
ultimately oppose them will show 
itself in their adopting the short 
range good of a school training 
technicians again, in spite of the 
long range dangers inherent in the 
fact that the school will be train-
ing their destroyers also. 

Essentially the strikers 
demand a completely autonomous 
Blacke and a Third World studies 
department. 

The police themselves 
were characterized as posses-
sing an uncertainty of what to 
do that leads to an obseSSlOn 
with tactics and uncontrolled 
fury in their attacks. Until 
recently. only Third World Lea-
ders had been arrested, but re-
cently they arrested 456 strikers 
(including some scabs). 

The actual effects of the 
police action have been the op-
posite of what the "bad guys" 
hoped for. Stanton called the 
arrest spectacle ,·the most spi-
rited thing I've ever seen--better 
than a football rally." However, 
the police earlier had a much 
more profound effect on th 
stnke, by theIr brutality they 
became "far and away th best 
educators we hay ," according 
to Stanton.

raqe 2 January 31 , 1969 

Put a Commie on the 
Board of Regents 

At a recent press conference, Governor Reagan made a most in-
teresting comment while replying to a question concerning his views 
on the rehiring of Dr. Herbert Marcuse. Reagan, in a rare display 
of moral integrity, granted Marcuse the right of free speech and 
admitted that he was probably academically qualified. 

However, he lamented what he referred to as a "preponderance of 
liberal views among the university faculty. He stated that he would 
like to see some professors of a more "conservative" nature. 

This statement and others that Reagan has made in reference to 
the current state of the university system imply that a vicious pLot 
is at hand on the part of militant and intolerant leftists to monopo-
lize the university and suppress other viewpoints. 

Now no one would want to suggest that our governor is not an 
astute 'intelligent man of the world who has a great deal of insight 
into the various complex social situations. However, there is one 
factor in the issue at hand that perhaps our honorable governor might 
have overlooked and that he might want to consider. 

Most of us would agree that, at least in theory, the university is 
the '1a ven of the academic elite and an institution at whIch the finest 
minds gather to seek truth. Is the re perhaps any correlation between 
this and the liberal views he ld by the major ity of the UC faculty ? 

Could it be that once one goe s beyond the supe rficial level of slo-
gans and simplistic solutions that characterize the kind of politicians 
of til law and order mold, one finds his political philosophy running 
in new directions? 

How ironical it is that Reagan, who complains of an academic bias, 
is helping to create one, along with his henchmen on the Board of 
Regents. 

As Cor Reagan' s admirable request for a balance of views from the 
political spectrum, perhaps this could be put into practice. The Board 
of Regents is currently dominated by a rather conservative faction 
of prosperous businessmen. There is far from a balance on this 
very powerful body. 

Unlike the liberalism of the university, the conservatism of the 
Regents is not the result of a natural and uninhibited evolution, but 
is instead the result of appointments made by governors of the State 
of California, political creatures politically motivated. 

To correct this lamentable situation then we suggest that Governor 
Reagan immediate ly appoint a socialist to the Board of Regents. We 
would also suggest the appointment of a Black Panther and a Chicano 
supporter of the grape boycott. Then perhaps we might see a real 
balance of politica l ideology. 

We would also suggest the appointment of members of such other 
minor ity groups as millionaires, chairmans of the Board of Directors, 
and actors , but we find that they are already well represented.

A Constructive Alternative 
An often heard criticism of protest movements 

and dissident groups is that most of the action 
and ideology tends to be negative in nature. It . 
is alleged that the destruction of the status quo 
is sought with lew positive alternatives offered. 

Several editorials in this paper have ruthlessly 
attacked the Board of Regents, refuting them as 
the legitimate governing body of the University 
of California. In order to avoid being accused 
of being nihilists or anarchists, we wish to offer 
several suggestions for the restructuring of the 
university in a manner somewhat more acceptable 
to students and laculty. but not so radically dif-
ferent as to be beyond the serious consideration 
of the current university power structure. 

their respective campuses. Perhaps a system 
could be devised whereby the Academic Senates 
nominate and elect their Chancellor. 

Thirdly, each Academic Senate would send its 
chairman or duly elected official to the meeting 
as its representative. These faculty members 
would have full voting privileges. 

Finally, the number of appointed Regents would 
be reduced to none. These Regents, who at least 
in theory are supposed to be community leaders, 
representing the general public, would be appointed 
by the governor and would have to be approved 
by a two-thirds vote of the Board of Regents. 

Another innovation would be a student repre-
sentative to be appointed by the AS President's 
Council, eith.er as a permanent representative, or 
on a rotating manner, with full voting privileges. 
The President of the University would be elected 
by the Board, having been nominated by the 
Governor. 

The first order of business should be to re-
legate all the political Regents to non-voting status. 
These ex-officio Regents are members of the Board 
by virtue of their position, usually an elective 
one. A California legislator has even proposed 
that these Regents be removed from the Board.

LETTERS 
Committee Member Defends A'thletic Report 

Dear Editor: 
The basic problem facing in-

tercollegiate athletics at UCSD 
is the controversy over initlat-
ing an athletic scholarshIp pro-
gram. As I see it, the argu-
ments against such a program 
are: 

(1) the university is expos-
ing itself to possible gross mis-
management i)f such a program; 

(2) possible lowering ot 
set academic standards; 

(3) the undesirability of 
"buying- athletes. 

To deny that there are yearly 
infractions of athletic scholar-
ship codes would be to deny 
reallty. For many Colleges, ath-
letics--especially football--is a 
business and many athletic de-
partments will stoop to any means 
necessary to acquire the athletes 
necessary for a conference or 
national championship. I for one 
don't want the major emphasis 
of this university to be the Sat-
urday afternoon games. 

The Intercollegiate Athletic 
Advisory Committee, of which I 
am a member, recognized the 
problems inherent to a program 
of subsidizing athletes. After 
hours of discussion, the comm-
ittee produced guidelines it felt 
were adequate to maintain tight 
control over an athletic scholar-
ship program. The guidelines 
passed upon were as follows: 

(1) Scholarships not to ex-
ceed mandatory fees ($318/ 
year); _ 

(2) Students must maintain 
a GPA of 2.0 and be making 
normal progress towards their 
C:egree in order to partiCipate 
in intercollegiate athletics. 
Those students admitted under 
special action shall be inelig-
ible to participate in intercoll-
egiate athletics until they have 
proven their academic com-
petence by establishing a GPA 
of 2.0; 

(3) AU financial assistance 
for athletes will be the same 
as for non-athletes and will be 
administered through the Fin-
ancial Aids Office on campus. 

(4) Funds for athletic schol-
arships would be raised exclu-
sively through private donations; 

(5) Any income accruing 
through intercollegiate athletic 
events shall be deposited in an 
income account designated Un-
allocated Registration Fees and 
shall be institutional funds. 

The Committee failed to reach 
agreement upon a recommend-
ation concerning the proposed 
program of aid because of an 
abhorance to "buying- athletes. 
As I understand it, the undesir-
ability of athletic aid is based 
upon a firm belief that we should 
not use athletic ability as a 
basis tor granting financial aid. 
I disagree with this position tor 
several reasons. First, the 
money to be used for these 
scholarships would be raised 
from private donations given 
specifically for an athletic pro-
gram. In other words, the ath-
letes are not taking scholarship 
funds away from deserving stu-
dents. 

The student-athlete receiving 
the scholarship will not be the 
"animal- one might encounter 
at USC or Notre Dame. The 
program can be set up to re-
quire any degree of scholastic 
ablllty on the part of the ath-
lete that the academic senate 
and the students deem necessary. 

Some segments of the faculty 
have expressed a fear that inter-
collegiate athletics might cause 
possible lowering of the aca-
demic standards at UCSD. Given 
that the athletes. Ylvolved are of 
the caliber as set above, I can 
see no way in which the ath-
letic program can have an ef-
fect upon the academic standards 
at this university. Those de-
cisions are the responsiblllty 
and are under the power of the 
faculty itself. 

But most important, I don't 
believe tbat giving scholarships 
as a "reward- for athletic abll1ty 
is unjustifiable. Scholarships are 
usually given on the premise of 
need and/ or promise of success. 
A student who has shown ex-
ceptional ability in math, English, 
science, etc., is often given a 
scholarship regardless of need. 
These scholarships are justified 
on the grounds that the student 
receiving them has a good chance 
at success both in and out of 
the university and that the stu-
dent enhances the university's 
image. 

Athletic scholarships can be 
justified in the same way. stu-
dies by the President 's Comm-
ission of Higher Education have 
shown that athletes enjoy better 
than average success both aca-
demically and within the comm-
unity. 

Athletics also is one of the 
easiest ways to allow a commun-
ity to identify and contribute to 
the university. UCSD, like most 
college campuses, needs more 
contact with the community about 
them and athletics can serve as 
one of the fir st bridges. 

Probably most important of 
these benefits is that obtained 
by the athlete himself. At pre-
sent, UCSD has nearly 300 stu-
dent-athletes participating in 19 
intercollegiate sports. But the 
program is still relatively in-
effective at producing all the 
above advantages to student and 
to the university. 

Secondly, UCSD has achieved 
a. reputation within the State for 
academic excellence. I believe 
any advancement of nonacademic 
student activities could only 
round out and enhance that image. 

The university and her stu-
dents also stand to reap some 
very concrete returns from an 
intercollegiate athletic program. 
The students stand to gain an 
increased sense of community on 
campus and an enhanced identi-
fication with the university. Many 
of the sports oUer relaxing enter-
tainment and a little fun amidst 
the trying academic endeavors of 
the quarter. 

The lack of depth makes most 
of our teams big underdogs. 
Scheduling problems because of ; 
lack of conference membership 
make schedules erratic and we 
are forced to compete with 
schools of smaller size and 
lesser academic standing. The 
problem is now more acute with 
the introduction ot football. 

The solution is relatively sim-
ple -- join an athletic confer-
ence composed of schools of sim-
ilar size and academic standards, 
but this entails giving of athletic 
scholarships. I pelieve the pho_f 
bia against the giving of such 
scholarships caf! be dispelled 
given a creative and tightly con-
trolled athletic program. 

May "student Power- decide 
the Issue. 

Sincerely, 
Jeff McCombs,

Moral Codes Are Relative 
Dear Editor: 

There's too much loose talk 
around the campus, these days -
as usual. It goes off in all 
directions because people use 
words too carelessly. This mud-
dles our thinking. So I thought 
I'd try to sort things out tor 
myself, and maybe for you-all 
too. 

Let's start with sex. By it-
self, the word' s almost mean-
ingless. There are two sexes 
(in most animals, anyway; let's 
skip the daisies!). They differ 
by the kind of sex cells they 
produce in sex organs, and by 
secondary sexual c~ra.cters like 
breasts apd beards. Sexual acts, 
using sexual organs, bring sex 
cells together, and thus complete 
the sexual cycle. So what's 
immoral about my breasts or 
your beard concealed or ex-
posed? Nothing, I believe; nudity 
may be immodest, but it's not 
immoral. 

Then what lsimmoral? Break-
ing a moral code, which is all 
tied up with ethics and religion. 
=,~, .. : .. ~ .... ,, ~ .' .. .. '# " '" • 

f '. . ' , t •• t .. •• ... III • ,. 

Premarital intercourse may be 
immoral, if you accept a moral 
code which says it's naughty; 
but otherwise, what's wrong with 
it ? Is it illegal? In some states, 
yes; In others, no - this depends 
on the laws written (mostly in 
pre-pill days) by the legislators. 

if the people who write the laws 
accept certain religious or moral 
codes, then these will tend to 
be echoed in the lawsi but they 
aren't the same thing at all. 
What is "right" morally may not 
always be "right" legally, and 
vice versa. It's a pity we have 
to use the same word for both 
ideas, since this hilps to muddle 
our thinking. 

Sometimes the two codes, the 
moral and tbe legal, point in 
oPpoiite directions. I happen to 
accept a lot of the moral code 
which lists, in the first place, 
"Thou shalt not kin- . Killing 
people is, to me, an immoral 
act. I don't care whether it 
concerns the killing ofpresiden~ 
with guns, o~ of Vietnamese with 

napalm, it is fundamentally im-
moral. But the law, whIch frowns 
on the killing of certain pres-
idents, not only condones but 
even insists on the killing of 
certain Vietnamese - witness the 
draft laws. Such actions, of 
course may be politically 
expedient or militarily nec-
essary, but they definite Iy are 
violations of the moral code that 
I've just mentioned. 

So some of our U.S. laws today 
promote immorality. I don't 
say that they are therefore 
"right" or "wrong". since these 
words can be misused in dif-
ferent ways; but I do say that 
we ought to try to keep our 
thinking clear and our priorities 
straight. ThUS, toplessness 
(which, franklY, leaves me cold) 
is not immoral; bombing (which 
I get het up about) is immoral. 
U you don't agree, cross out the 
appropriate "Thou shalt not ... -
item from your moral code, or 
re-think.

Blaclc Studies Program 
Sought at Eastern Colleges 

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (CPS)-
Calling the history of black 
Americans "a legitimate and ur-
gent academic endeavor," a fa-
culty committee recommended 
creation of a degree program 
in Afro- American studies at Har-
vard University last week. 

The recommendation came af-
ter nine months of study and 
discussion with black student 
learders at the prestigious Ivy 
League school. Changes in Har-
vard's investments , r ecrUitment, 
social life , and cultural affairs 
aimed at improving the status 
of blacks were also ur ged. 

The committee repor t no doubt 
gives moral support and legiti-
macy to blacks on other cam-
puses who for the past two weeks 
have taken overt actions to dram-
atize their demands. 

Among the Harvard recom-
mendations are more black pro-
fessors, administrator s, and re-
search personnel; a social and 
cultural center for the blacks, 
vigorous r ecruitment of black 
graduate students; greater em-
phasis on the experience of blacks 
in all courses; and more re-
search in Afro-American Stud-
ies. 

The committee noted that 
"black students feel alienated 
from, even neglected within, Har-
vard." It called the absence of 
courses in black culture " the 
single most potent source of 
black students' discontent " 
there. 

Harvard has been spared the 
kind of rebellion such alienation 
has caused on other campuses--
most recently Bran.dels, Swarth-
more, San Francisco state and 
others-but Its students have 

levelled charges of irrelevancy 
and inadequacy. 

In other developments in the 
black student movement: 

Roy Innis, national director of 
the Congress of Racial Equa lity 
(CORE ), said in New York that 
he supports de mands for all-
black study programs and dormi-
tor ies. Innis' statement is in dir-
ect opposition to the stand taken 
last week by Roy Wilkins of the 
NAACP, who war ned of a new 
" Jim Crowism." 

The CORE leader pledged to 
commit the group 's resources to 
"defend and safeguard the stu-
dents if the NAACP br ings court 
action to block creation of all -
black programs." Innis said the 
blacks' demands represent a 
legitimate desire for black ident-
ity, self- awareness and together-
ness. 

Militant blacks at Brandeis 
Univer sity near Boston say they 
will continue the ir struggle to 
win their demar.d~ 'or black stud-
ies and recruitment despite hav-
ing given up the campus com-
munication center for 11 days in 
exchange for amnesty. 

Classes have been suspended 
at predominantly Negro Wilber-
force University in Ohio, where 
administrators agreed to nego-
tiate student grievances over 
handling of disciplinary cases. 
Officials are still investigating 
a $100,000 fire which destroyed 
the student union last week. Arson 
was blamed for another fire at 
nearby Central state University. 

Swarthmore College blacks 
ended their sit- in at the ad-
missions oUice out of respect 
for the school's pr esident, who 
died of a heart attack while the 
demonstration was occurring.

PARTm 
(Luee): Not only is political in-
tolerance wrong and unfeasible 
but it is a dangerous thing be-
cause at a certain point the New 
Left isn't going to put me away. 
I'm prepared on a different level 
to play that game further than they 
are. I really am. And I know a 
number of people who are fight-
ing generally the left, who are 
speaking ~ut against them, who 
are equally capable of not only 
defending themselves but their 
famllies if it is going to get on 
that level. If it gets on that level, 
then we have really returned to 
what we saw in Nazi Germany-
street gangs fighting each other. 

We don't want to see that, and 
nothing that, for instance, the 
groups I'm working with now, 
have advocated is anything like 
this. We want to discuss it. We 

still want to seek solutions . 
The Left doesn't want to anymore. 
At S. F. state they are beating 
up the opposition showing that 
the opposition is not just per-
sona non grata any more, but 
that they are ready for violence. 
It is a hell of a situation. If 
indeed, at L. B. State, v4i~n YAF 
sets up a literature ta~~, just 
as SDS can, and people come over 
and destroy the literature, then 
free speech doesn't mean any-
thing. It is just power, real 
naked power. 

Well, the Left may have the 
naked power at the moment, but 
it is only because nobody has 
mobilized against them. But I 
can assure you if it had to get 
to that level. that the forces on 
the so- called right could mobi-
lize much more 'strength'. The 
violence has got to stop and the 
only place it can stop is with 
the left." 

(TT): "I've got a few ques-
tions here on your opinions on 
various specific issues since the 
right isn't heard from very much, 
particularly on this campus." 

(Luce): "Let me just interupt. 
The right will be heard from. 
You can expect to see at UCSD 
and San Diego state not only an 
increase in 'right-wing activity' 
but every s tudent at UCSD is 
going to soon be receiving mail-
ing concerned with the left wing 
and with the fight for democracy 
on this campus. It will come 

from a general source but YAF 
is in large part respo[ , sible for 
the distribution of this.' • 

(TT): "Who is gOilg to be 
writing these things th: t will be 
mailed to us?" 

(Luce): "Some of thE m were 
written by people in thl' general 
area. Others are repri ltS. For 
instance, Leo Rosten , who has 
excellent credentials as a liberal 
reporter and commentator, writ-
ing in Look two months ago, did 
an excellent article on answers 
to a New Leftist. We reprinted 
that. That will be distributed 
as the Ilrst piece ot literature." 

(TT): "Who specifically is 
fund int them ?" 

(Luce): "I wouldn't want to 
say." 

(TT): "Are there any connec-
tions with the John Birch 
Society?" 

(Luce}. "To the best of my 
knowledge, no. It is just a group 
of concerned people that set up 
a project.'· 

(TT}. "Why are you hesitant 
to reveal who these people are?" 

(Luce}. "Because they are 
businessmen in general and have 
just gotten together to do this 
project. There is no hesitancy 
except that they don't want to 
be specifically identified. They 
certainly are not Birchers and 
to the best of my knowledge they 
don't belong to any organi-
zations. " 

(TT): "Whlle you are on the 
point of these new activities, I 
saw you over Christmas in L.A. 
at a press conference and you 
stated that any attempts to close 
down campuses, and I think you 
'cited UCSD, were going to be 
dealt with with some sort of 
active resistence to those 
attempts. 1 was wondering ex-
actly what kinds of active resis-
tence that would be." 

(Luce}. "That would depend 
on the campus. It depends on 
where YAF or organizations 
close to us would agree and so 
on. Our general approach is 
as follows: That we believe 
that the essence of the free uni-
versity and the academic envir-
onment is one in which intimida-
tion should not be passively ac-
cepted. When people would come 
into your classrooms, for 
instance, and attempt to intimi-
date the people as they did at 
S. F. state, by throwing things 
through the windows and telling 
them to get out of the classes, 
we would simply call on the 
people in that classroom to stand 
up and move towards those peo-
ple who were trying to break 
up the classroom and take them 
outside the door. If there is 
a general strike called and the 
majority of students agree to do 
it, then they should s trike. Our 
position is, however, that many 
of the students who are involved 
in these strike activities would 
like to go to class and that the 
Left, by being::. minority on many 
of the se campuses, are using open 
intimidation to try and get peo-
ple not to go to classes. 

What we are calling on is for 
students who want to go to clas-
ses to take an active role and 
since the Left is using physical 
power to try and keep them out 
of the classroom, for them to 
resort , if necessary, to physical 
power. The last thing we want 
to see are the police called in 
because history has shown that 
once the police are caUed in, 
it all escalates. It is a student 
problem. It's not a problem for 
the police or the governor. 

And what people are beginning 
to say now on some of the cam-
puses is 'I am going to class 
and the people in my class want 
to stay here i those that don't 
can leave. We are going to 
stay here and we are going to 
hold a class. Now please re-
move yourself from the room.' 
And II they don't remove them-
c;p1ves from the room, we will 
remove them. 'Wle ha.':~ :I. right 
to go to class." 

(TT): "I'd like to get a few 
things down about your gene ral 
philosophy. Again, to quote Fred 
Krinsky, "conservatives often 
oppose legislation aimed at re-
form like civil rights bills and 
urban renewal, on the grounds 
of it being unconstitutional. Pro-
bably most ot it is, but then 
he argues that most at the pro-
blems of modern society could 
not have possibly been even en-
visioned by the Founding Fathers. 
For example, s mog; they could 
never havp dreamt It up. 

Therefore it is time to begin 

some klrid of rac11cal change in 
the scope of government and 
give it some power to deal with 
not only these quantitatively new 
problems butquaUtaUvely dltter-
ent things. Society today is not 
even close to what it was 'back 

then' ". 
(Luce): "There are, of 

course, different schools of 
thought on the right. There are 
many right-wing people who are 
extreme libertarians, that would 
call for the total aboUlion of 
the government and a return to 
almost complete freedom which I 
don't believe has ever existed. 

I think that government does 
have a role. I do very defi-
nitely. For instance, I am strong-
ly in favor of government regu-
lations of food and drug laws .. ,. 
I think that many of our problems 
in the U.S. are not because the 
Founding Fathers did not en-
vision them, but simply because 
the government has decided to 
take them on .... I am opposed to 
any number of governments acts 
that I think infringe upon the 
rights of citizens ." 

(TT): "In The Sane Society, 
Eric Fromru made a statement 
to the effect that natives in the 
South Sea Islands are consider-
ably more healthy, both mentally 
and physically, than people in 
advanced industrial societes. 

And tbat despite all the mater ial 
wealth in this country, we are 
more frustrated, neurotic, and 
all1enated. To the extent that 
this has occured, capitalism has 
reaUy failed as far as liberating 
man from his previous condition 

of being unfree in a spiritual 
sense and a material sense. 

During the 1800' s the belief 
was that capitalism would once 
and lor all liberate man from 
not only economic wants, but 
with the birth of the French and 
American revolutions, would Ii-' 
berate man from political bond-
age as well. Captitalism has 
not done this. This is often 
the protest for radical revision." 

(Luce): "I think it is gen-
erally accepted that capitalism 
has increased the material lot 
of people living in these coun-
tries and also increased alien-
atioa, but this will happen in 
any country that increases its 
technology. This alienation is 
equalled in the Soviet Union .... 
I don't see this as a bad sign 
per se. Arthur Koestler, in The 
Ghost in the Machine, points out 
that there is this proble m of 
alienation not just in capitalist 
countries but generally in the 
world, and his whole concept is 
that science itself is developing 
any number of answers to it. 
He contends that what we will 

ultimately see is a 'peace pill' 
that people will really take." 

(TT} "Coming back to the 
present, for a moment, what are 
the prospects of having a volun-
tary military? Do you think Nix· 
on w1ll really do it?" 

(Luce): "I think he is com-
mlled to it. I think there is 
a better chance now than there 
has been in the past that it will 
pass. " 

(TT): "What is your niewthen 
of the U.S.'s involvement In Viet-
nam?" 

(Luce): "That is a questlon 
that differs in YAF circles. 
YAF's oHicial position is that 
the U.S. should win the war in 
Vietnam. Many of us however 
feel that as the conditlons now 
stand, the only thing we can have 
is a Korean-type government. I 
generally believe that the U.S. 
forces should do what they are 
beginning to do - pacification 
work. I totally oppose any type 
of agreement in Paris that would 
allow for a coalition government 
or for the South Vietnamese to 
be turned over to the Com-
munists. 1 oppose that because 
first of all, it would mean that 
thousands of Americans have gi-
ven up their lives for nothing and 
secondly, that we are simply 
turning ove rt he fate of millions of 
South Vietnamese who ha ve fought 
with us, to the retribution of 
the Communists. ,. 

«TT): "What about the charge 
that the government in South Viet-
nam is a puppet government?" 

(Luce): "Those kinds ofthings 
are always a charge made up 
by the opposition. I think that 
the government of South Vietnam 
is not truly representative. I 
don't think democracy as we 
know it could be imposed in South 
Vietnam. I think that in such 
a war situation a strong govern-
ment, centralized as it is, is 
necessary. The elections held 
were a good sign, not perfect, 
but a good sign. 

And I think that tlle majority 
of the people in South Nietnam 
do not want communism. This 
doesn't mean they want capi-
talism as we have It, but they 
don't want totalitarian govern-
ment. They have had a history 
of this. If we can provide them 
safety to create and produce, then 
that is as much as we can be 
held responsible Cor." 

Legislature Receives Bills 
To Limit University Power. 

Since this session ot the s tate legislature began 
on January 6, there have been 22 legislative bUts 
and two constituUonal amendments presented in 
Sacramento dealing with the' university and state 
college systems. Of the bills presented only 
two would probably be warmly received by the 
majority of s tudents. These bills were appro-
priations of funds to the state colleges to provide 
lor greater enrollment. 

The remaining bilIs mainly dealt with sup-
pressing and taking disciplinary action against 
students and faculty involved in campus protest. 

The first bill introduced in the senate this 
session will, if passed, make it illegal to will-
fully disrupt any class or academic activity. 
Unde r such legislation, the march through the lib-
rary following the Regents meeting last Novem-
ber could have resulted in mass arres ts . 

Another senate bill, number 51, bars outside 
people Cram entering the campus if they appear 
as a menace to the peaceful conduct of the cam-
pus in the eyes of the administration. 

Bill number 56 gives to the administration a 
power up till now exercised mainly by students, 
the power to s hut down the university. 

Bill number 20 gives the university adminis-
tration tbe power to fire any employee who en-
gages in some type of campus disruption. 

The senate even introduced legislation which 
would limit the perogaUves of the drama depart-
ments. U b1ll number 32 passes, it w1ll be 11-

legal to engage in any simulated act of sexual 
intercourse during any play, television, or movie 
production which is sponsored or presented on 
any university or college campus. As for the 
"Real McCoy", no specific mention was made 
in the bill. 

The Assembly has also been deluged with b11ls 
dealing with the university. Most are similar 
to those which have been submitted to the senate. 

There are however two bills on the floor of 
the assembly which are of a very different nature 
than those before the other house. Blll number 
20, sponsored by Pete Wilson from San Diego, 
was described in the Legislative Council's Digest 
as follows; ' ... authorized dis missal of state 
college employees for participating in or enclting 
any strike or boycott at any state college campus 
or facility .. .' 

Another blll, number 48, to which Wilson's name 
is also attached as a sponsor, would provide In 
all future contracts between s tate colleges and 
employees a provision stating that the contract 
will be terminated if the employee takes any 
part in a strike Of boycott. 

These two bllls , if passed , would eUminate 
the power of collective bargaining by the faculty. 

Also introduced at this session were consti-
tutional amendments. Both would reduce the term 
of the Regents from 16 to 8 years, and make it 
mandatory for senate approval of the appointment 
made by the governor.

Tijerina - PAID ADVERTISEMENT by Colonial Olds =========1 
~Deep in the Ear 'of the Lion' 

by CZayton Ande~8on 
Reies Lopez Tijerina, perhaps the most color-

ful personality to come out of the Southwest 
since Goldwater quipped his way into' temporary 
retirement, visited our campus last Friday night. 
Tijerina, fresh from a startling victory in a 
New Mexico court battle, gave a somewhat rambl-
ing account of the Brown view of America and 
of his battle to secure land rights for his people. 

The land rights in question concern the Treaty 
of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed in 1848, and Tijerina 
contends that the provisions of the treaty were 
violated by the U.S. Government. He stated that, 
in 1904, Theodore Roosevelt confiscated this land 
which amounted to 1715 pueblo free city-states or 
land gran ts. 

While -Tijerina was unclear as to the details 
surrounding either the confiscation or the terms 
of the treaty, he drew a bitter contrast between 
the treaties which our government recognizes , 
particularly in Southeast Asia, and those of Mexican 
or Indian policy which are ignored. 

He went, on to state that our Presidents have 
been enforCing the laws of the rich, rather than 
the poor, and that what his people need is the 
enforcement of the Cohstitution, not the powdered 
milk that goes to the New Mexico Indo-Hispanos 
who are on relief. 

The bulk 01 his speech, however, concerned 
the Chicano view of American society. It was 
not a concise, articulate attack, but rather the 
gut emotions of a man who has had his family 
endangered by bomb attacks and his organization 
harrassed by the local authorities . 

Tijerina contends that Anglo-America has tried 
to "melt" everybody's culture into English, and 
the result has been the surpression of minority 
culture. He sees this in New Mexico where 
the failure to make education relevant to 'the cul-

Internationally known jazz flut-
ist, Paul Horn, will be on campus 
next week, not in his capacity 
as a musician, but rather to 
present the first of a series ot 
two introductory lectures on 
Transcendental Meditation as 
taught by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. 
The lecture series will be held 

on Thursday evenings. Feb. 6 
and 20, 8:00 p.m., H-L Aud. 

ture has driven many people out of school. Atter 
they are driven out of school they go on the wel-
fare rolls, as Tljez:ina indicates by saying that 
60 per cent of the Chicanos in New Mexico are 
on relief. 

Against this background of misery, the Alianza 
Federal del los Pueblos Libres was founded by 
Tijerina in 1963. Although this organization has 
had its ups and downs, he feels that it remains 
the best hope for the Chicano. It is in New Mex-
iCO, he states, that his people have the strongest 
claims against the SOCiety, and it is also the one 
state where the Anglos are the weakest. If he 
can break through in New Mexico, he contends, 
the Indo-Hispanos throughout the country will 
be affected. 

In these efforts, Tijerina has fought against 
some of the most powerful elements of any society. 
His trial last December, stemming from his 
attempted citizens arrest of the district attorney 
illustrate this point. He told of how he humll~ 
iated the prosecuting attorney and destroyed their 
case. but found that the press of the nation refused 
to carry the s tory. They didn't want to "stain" 
your minds with the true story, so it came as 
quite a shock to the country when the jury of 
six Chicanos, five Anglos and a Negro returned 
a verdict of not guilty. 

Tijerina went on to ridicule the labels of " red ' 
and "insurrectionist" that have been pinned on 
him by some of the press. He says that he is 
no more than a "cricket deep in the ear of the 
lion", but just listen to what that lion screams 
when he can·t scratch the inside ot his ear! 

Tijerina claims that "I'm not an enemy - I'm 
just a realistic person who has faced the facts." 

With the awakening of the minorities, led by 
people like Reies Tijerina, the lion had better 
do more than just scratch. 

Subaru ••• 
by John Demil',iian 

Have you ever navigated a 
25 horsepower baby buggy around 
the treacherous curves of Torrey 
Pines Road on a routine trip 
into La Jolla (for a trip it really 
is! !)? It' s something that rides 
like a balloon and sounds like a 
sonic boom. But you can really 
dig it if you put your heart into 
it. You can park it and drive it 
almost anywhere. It is the un-
challenged, undisputed king of 
the sidewalk. 

It's the Subaru 36O-an Orient-
al vehicular versionofthe minia-
ture tree stump. And if you de-
spise motorcycles and are hep 
to righteous gas mileage, it is 
the car tor you. If you get tired 
of driving it. you have the option 
of buying a paddle. It take s only 
you and your roomate to turn it 
upside down in this past two 
weeks' rain and paddle it wher-
ever you want to go. Or you can 
walk it on a leash or even enter 
the slot races. 

But let' s present facts about 
this car: For a cost of $1297 
(p.o.e.) and around 66 miles 
per gallon, you have to give up 
something. Most of us here at 
UCSD are most of the time broke. 
With this pauper's purse we pos-
sess, the Subaru is ideal for 
campus transportation and local 
commuting. (It seems very un-
like ly we'll see enclosed motor-
cycles in the near future.) 

In Japan, it has been on the 
,road for 10 years and is, more 
,or less, the people's car. And 
after these 10 years of pro-
duction, you can be relatively 
certain the majority of the me-
chanical troubles have been 
worked out by the engineers. 
Over this time the factory aver-
age to maintain the six-month/ 
6000 mile warranty was $1.50. 

The '360' weighs in at 925 
lbs. and measures, when stood on 
end, up to our 9' 10" Amazon 
named Clover. The engine is a 
rear- mounted, two-cycle engine 
that pushes 25 HP at 5500 rpm. 

The body is monocoque. Four 
wheel independent suspension can 
fioat you over the largest beer 
bottle around. But if you run into 
SDG&E's daily diggings , you're 
in definite trouble. Or so you may 
think, because before you can ac-
tually compute any facts, you' re 
out. The ten inch tires may

Standard equipment includes

There is one definite disad-
vantage. On the highway, the Su-
baru can be called a "two-cycle. 
two cylinder,four-wheel, floating 
death trap." But this depends on 
the driver. A good rally driver 
can take it over Interstate 5, but 
there Is definite doubt of the 
ordinary student driver's ability. 
I took an interesting ride over 
the Cross Count ry Track. It can 
get itself out of any rut in the 
course and even give a well-
built trailblke a daring challenge. 

But I can say that I would 
rather drive through La Jolla or 
down Mission Blvd. than out on 
interstate 5. On such trips via 
business and residential r outes, 
it does a commendable job scoot-
ing in, around, and through traf-
fic as well as any motorbike. 

There are advantages--ex-
tre mely difficult to flip, good 
riding after break-in-peribd, 
well put together engine, remark- ' 
ably good suspension and bump-
handling ability, performance 
specs and stopping distances in-
cluded, and a rarity (a hand-
brake that actually stops the car 
underway}--and there are dis-
advantage~el1cate dash con-
trols, so- so cornering ability, 
excessive road nOise, and po-
tential danger on.l super highway. 

Two major things that are 
deti itely important. Goo4-easy 
to push when you run out of gas. 
Bad--baving to look at VW tires. 

It 's not a bad little car for a 
student who's out of money most 
of the time. It's like instant 
coUee. People might like it if it 
weren't called coffee; the Subaru 
if it weren't called a car. But 
it's not a scoote r either. Some-
where between the ear category 
and the two-wheeled realm is a 
never-never land. And there you 
can navigate the Subaru '360' to 
your heart' s content. 

If you are interested even at 
looking at one, contact Joe Al-
dredge at Colonial Oldsmobile 
in La Jolla. And even better, if 
you want to put it through its 
paces for a week, give the car 
a name and drop it off at the 
Student Activities Office, Bldg. 
250 MC. The contest ends Feb. 
21. and vou can probably win. 

Mr. Horn, who is currently 
playing with his Jazz Quintet in 
the L.A. area, has been work-
ing very closely the past two 
years with the Students' Inter-
national Meditation SOCiety 
(SIMS) as a lecturer and ini-
tiator. SIMS, a new organ-
ization at UCSD (there are about 
500 meditators in San Diego, 
30 of them at UCSD), is repre-
sented by well over 1,000 mem-
bers at UCLA and Berkeley, and 
close to that number at UC Santa 
Barbara. 

confuSion, frustration and chaos 
reigned supreme." As for his 
initial experience with T.M.: "I 
was given personal instruction in 
the technique and immediately 
felt the great release of tension 
and increased energy in my daily 
life." 

r ----- -

There are also meditation cen-
ters at three other UC campuses, 
Harvard, Yale, and many other 
colleges and universities in the 
U.S. as well as Europe, South 
America, and the Far East. 

Transcendental Meditation is a 
natural, enjoyable technique for 
systematically expanding the 
conscious mind, thus enabling the 
individual to gain integration in 
all areas of life. Students prac-
ticing T.M. report greater 
energy, greater happiness, in-
creased power of concentration. 

Although meditation is basic-
ally a spiritual expe rience, the 
technique- itse If is so simple 
and so comprehensible that its 
mechanics can be explained in 
such a way as to satisfy even 
the most s cientific mind (there 
are Professors of Physics med-
Itating at Yale and Berkeley, 
a Professor of Psychology at 
Irvine, etc.). 

In 1967, Horn travelled to Rish-
Ikesh, India, where every year 
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who 
founded the Spiritual Hegener-
ation Movement in 1958, spends 
three months training men 
and women from all over 
the world as teachers of T.M. 

Mabarishl (meaning II great 
sage") , who since 1958 has given 
his technique to over 200,000 
individuals in 60 countries, more 
than fulfilling his 10-year goal, 
is now going back into sec lusion 
in the Himalayas , leaving more 
than 300 trained teachers to carry 
out his project of world wide 
spiritual regeneration.

·Funny Girl'· Seco nd Best 
by Dave Sac herman 

1968 was the year of the dis-
appointing musical. Six impor-
tant, expensive musicals opened, 
perhaps more than any preceding 
year, and five of these proved 
to be considerable letdowns. (The 
sixth was "Oliver!-, an over-
whelming success.) 

Among the five which incluol:O 
"HaU a Sixpence-, "Star!", and 
"Finian's Rainbow· must be in-
cluded the film adaptation of the 
Broadway hit, "Funny Girl-. If 
it is any consolation, "Funny 
Glr 1". an elaborate musical 
comedy in the glossiest Holly-
wood tradition, is probably the 
best of the five. 

Directed by one of the world's 
three or four finest directors, 
Wllliam Wyler, it is the story 
of vaudeville star Fanny Brice, 
who struggled from a ghetto to 
the Ziegfeld Follies on a power-
ful combination of brass and tal-
ent. Barbra streisand, as Fanny, 
gives a very fine performance 
perfected over months on stage 
and enriched by the resources 
of the screen. 

That she is a great s inger 
whose songs glow with fervor and 
emotion is not news. But she 
here proves herself a versatne, 

snrewo, sentimental comedienne 
of great talent who as Fanny Brice 
uses selt-deprecating comedy to 
defend her lack of beauty. In-
deed, the film's message is that 
talent is beauty. 

However, the film adaptatIOn 
of • Funny Girl- is still a weak, 
musically inadequate work which 
would be very little without Miss 
streisand. While the staging of 
the production numbers had an 
improvisational quality which 
gave a satiric look at vaudeville, 
very few of the songs were mem-
orable and stirring. 

The second half of the film 
which concentrated on Fanny's 
unhappy marriage to gambler 
Nick Arnstein had far less music 
than the stage version, thus con-
tributing a loss of momantum 
which was not compensated for 
by any enrichment 01 drama. 

Of the two most impreSSive 
songs, "People" was shot in a 
studio alley and was therefore 
not nearly as effective as it 
could have been. "Don't Rain 
on My Parade- ,the most impres-
sive moment of the film, is a 
pursuit of her man by train and 
cab to New York which ends in 
a soaring view passing the sta-
tue of Liberty by tugboat with 
Miss streisand on the bridge. 
Otherwise, the music was rather 

weak. 
The casting at Omar Sharif 

as wealthy gambler Arnstein was 
an obvious mistake. His con-
tinental cool is out of place 
here, He creates a character 
lacking in flashy entertainment 
and devoid of humor. The far 
from outstanding script falls oft 
in the second half as Fanny's 
sad marriage to Arnstein is just 
not consistently engrossing and 
interesting. Her relationship to 
him fits into a too well-known 
pattern of backstage fiction con-
cerning people living in two dif-
ferent worlds. Somehow among 
all this. the full flavor of life 
in the 1930's seems to have been 
lost. 

One of the two main assets 
of the film are the rich, glowing 
sets such as Arnstein's lavish 
dining room and in the "Rain 
on My Parade- production num-
ber. The other asset is Miss 
streisand. Thotlgh her comedy 
didn't overwhelmingly impress 
me, she can be as heartbreaking 
as she can be funny. She has 
an aptitude for suffering and is 
fiercely direct, expressing her 
emotions openly and concealing 
nothing. Sadly enough, she can-
not carry the film alone. It 
remains musically weak and is 
not as sympathetic and moving 
as I would have hoped.

Grapplers Rally, 
Tie Biola 17 -17 
With a strong finish in the hea-

vier weight classes, the UCSD 
wrestling team jarred a strong 
team (rom Biola with a 17-17 
tie. The Triton wrestlers showed 
obvious improvement over last 
year's team which dropped a 25-6 
decision to the same opponents. 

Biola College took a quick 9-0 
advantage with consecutive wins 
at 123, 130, and 137 pound divi-
sions. But giant-killer Robert 
Nemcik, wrestling a much taller 
opponent at 145 pounds came thru 
with a big 16-5 victory in his 
match. 

This inspired the Tritons in 
the following matches. Tom Grant 
turned in an exce llent perfor-
mance at 152 poul\ds, but time 
ran out as he came out on the 
short end of a 3-2 decision. But 
Phil Costello (I60)the mighty 
"Mole", presented the iocals 
with an 11-4 win, nearly pinning 
his opponent in the second period. 
At 167, Fred Grunewald won a 
squeaker with a 4-3 deCision, al-
though he had five minutes of 
riding time in which to build up 
a bigger lead. 

The most pleasant surprise 
for the UCSD mat men came in 
the 177 poulJd match when an in-
spired Larry RaM pinned his 
opponent in 4:48. For his per-
formance , Raful won outstanding 
wrestle r of the week honors. 

Bob Jackson performing in the 
191 division ran into trouble a-
gainst a very strong Biola man, 
losing his match by a faU in 4: 11 . 
In spite of the loss , Jackson look-

ed ve ry good considering his lack 
experience. Coach Millenbah ex-
pects great improvement from 
this dedicated competitor; Jack-
son had to drop near Iy ten pounds 
to be able to wrestle at 191. 

With the score 17-14, Biola in 
the lead, big Ed Courvette took 
the mat, knowing that the outcome 
of the meet depended on him. Ed 
tried everything he could to pin 
his opponent to give the Tritons 
the five points that would have 
meant victory. But the Biola 
heavyweight did little more than 
lie on his stomach for the dura-
tion of the match. Big Ed won 
a 5-0 decison in an emotlon-fIl-
led match. 

Coach Millenbah, commenting 
after the match, praised the en-
tire Triton team (or an outstan-
ding and surprisingly strong per-
(ormance. Particular congratu-
lations went to Raful and Cour-
vette for their fine jobs. Millen-
bah stressed that the team need-
ed more conditioning in order to 
be able to wrestle at full speed 
during the grueling eight minute 
matches. Millenbah was also very 
pleased and thankful for the turn-
out of wrestling supporters who 
attended the match. 

UCSD wrestling fans will have 
another great opportunity to see 
the team in action tonight at 6: 30 
in the gymnasium against a good 
Pasadena team. So come out to-
night and support the grapplers--
no admission charge for UCSD 
students.

Cage Results 
The freshman basketball team 

is still in its poor ball-handling 
rut,' according to Coach Barry 
Cunningham. They hold a 1-2 re-
cord in recent weeks. 

In the past two weeks, the frosh 
have lost to UC Riverside 82-73, 
lost to Saddleback 58-47, and beat 
Chapman College 70-67. Coach 
Cunningham complimented Dave 
Gregory, Paul Kroger and Jim 
Kendall for their efforts during 
this period. 

The frosh now have a 3-8 re-
cord. Despite the appearances of 

. this record, our frosh cagers 
have been ineveryball~me. The 
eight ball games bave roen lost 
by a total at only 61 points, an 
average of less than eight points 
per loss . 

However, Coach Cunningham 
commented, "Our passing and 
ball handling have hurt us In the 
close games." Hopefully the Tri-
ton youngsters will overcome 
this problem and realize their 
potential during the rest of the 
season. 

The next frosh game is against 
UC Santa Barbara at 8:00 pm in 
the gym. Tomorrow night, the 
freshmen take on UC Riverside 
in another home game. 

Swimming 
The Triton swim team prac-

tically got washed out of the 
pool against a strong UC Irvine 
swim team that included four all-
Americans. 

The final score was 72-24 in 
favor of Irvine, who took first 
and second in all but a few events. 

High-point man for the meet 
was Triton Doug Kraatz, who 
took fir st in the I and 3 meter 
diving events against no comp-
etition. Aiso scoring for UCSD 
were Steve Strand (second in 
the LOOO yd. frees tyle) and Bob 
Gave (second in the 200 yd. 
breaststroke ). 

Rugby 
The Triton rugby team will 

take on the UC Riverside team at 
2:00 p.m. here on Saturday, Feb-
ruary 1. They play UCLA on 
Tuesday, Feb. 4, at 3:00 p.m. 
in another home game. We have 
a good team this season , so get 
out to the soccer field tomorrow 
and root for them.

Many students have felt that 
the gulf between the two groups 
ha,s been widening recently. Pro-
position Three failed to pass and 
television coverage of student 
actions and opinions has tended 
to be inaccurate and limited in 
the eyes of many students. Con-
sequently, it was felt by the AS 
officers that some organization 
was necessary to promote better 
relations. 

Kathi Hoffer, chairman of the 
newly-formed committee, feels 
that in the search to make the 
university a relevant institution, 
an awareness of public opinion 
is essential. "It is hereby evi-
dent that the community and the 
university are essential to a 
dynamic existence of both; the 
bonds of communication between 
them must be built up." 

Several sub-committees of the 
PR committee have been formed 
to help accomplish the intended 
goals. One such sub-committee, 
conSisting of those skilled in 
public speaking, will attend meet-
ings of various San Diego clubs, 
and will appear on radio and 
te levis ion. 

Another sub-committee will be 
responsible for writing to, wel-
coming, and conducting guided 
tours to campus visitors. 

Other duties to be performed 
by appropriate sub-committees 
will be newspaper writing, and 
the planning of se.minars, din-
ners, and informal discussions. 

The members of the PR com-
mittee feel that student involve-
ment is the crucial issue. They 
feel that there are a great many 
students who want to meet with 
the public and discuss issues of 
importance to the university and 
SOCiety. 

Two student representatives 
have already spoken on "Toptc," 
KFMB radio, and at club lun-
cheons. However, more partici-
pants are needed to get involved 
in the program. 

Anyone interested may submit 
their name, telephone number 
and interests to Kathi Hofter, 
MC 250, or P. O. Box 4215. for 
more information call Kathilfot-
fer at 453-1197.
