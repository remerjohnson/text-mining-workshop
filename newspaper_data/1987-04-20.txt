ASUCSD 
Elections 
continue 
By PETER MESSROBIAN 

The battle for th ree Associated 
tudents Council po ts will con-

tinue this Tue day and Wednes-
day. 

Those arc the days when 
students wlil vote for a ReveJle 
SenIOr Senator, MUir Junior 
enator, and A.S. PreSident. 

Unless there IS a tie , the fir t two 
races wIJl be over and done with by 
Wednesday afternoon , but the top 
vote-getter In the pre Identlal race 
mu t have 50 percent-olus-one 
of the votes to Win that office. If he 
does not, there will be a run-off 
between the first and second place 
finisher . 

The candidates for A.S. 
PreSident are David Friend, Dave 
MarchlCk, Enc Wels , and Byron 
Morton . The Guardlwl interviewed 
three of the four hopefuls , and 
what follows IS a grouping of each 
the Landldate ' tand on vanous 
IS ue . 

Both Floor Wnter and Metzger 
stated that they have had 
prevIous confrontations. 1ctzger 
hdd <llso called the police once 
before. Floor Writer claimed that 
though the police did not 
respond on that first all , he had 
waited for them "to prove a 
pOint." 

Floor Writer tated that he \V.IS 
not aware 01 Metzger's <;econd 
call, he Just saw Metzger pass by 
him in the tclHwcll without 
exch<mglng any word . The next 
thing that happened , Floor 
Wnter was being handculfed by a 
p hce olTi er and being charged 
br Metzger with vandalism. 

The drawings on the walls of H&SS stairwells are considered art by some and vandalism by others. Both Wei sand Fnend made an issue about the revamping of their 
campaIgns. Fnend believes his 
(ormer eflorts were "too complex" 
and 'iul1ercd from to U'ilng n 
v.lgue I ues rather than spe ific 
problems "I took a lot for granted ," 
said Fnend , "and I ran a broad 
campaign that was hard to relate to 
[forI tudents." He promised a 
"more coherent campaign this 
time , with fresh Ideas." Weiss 
rdated a Imilar talc, and said that 
while hiS Issues were " ignlficant" 
he approa hed them with "broad 

"I think that what he doe IS 
not only immoral , but highly 
unethical:' Metzger said , "We 
can't have a community here 
unless we respect each other's 
rights. And this means thar I can't 

reach out and tart scnbbling on 
your hin, for instance, becau:.e H 
belongs [0 you." 

'These wall belong to the 
citizens of the community. They 
belong to all of us and so the u e 
of them has to be decided on by 
all of u ," Metzger added, "What 
he did was very unethical, and I 
am very unhappy over the fact 
that so many people sympathize 
with him, because that show that 
they arc very unethical too." 

UCSD's first ever 
liver patient dies 

UC D Medical Center's first liver 
tran plant patient died, aturday or cau es 
related to the patient'S body rejection of 
the organ. 

The patient, a middle-aged Linda Vista 
woman became the center's first liver 

transpl~nt last March . he later had to 
undergo a econd transplant Apnl 5 after 

\ h::r body rejected the hrst transplanted 
organ. 

Liver tranplants arc onsidered risky, 
largely becau e rejections of the 
transplanted organ are common pia e and 
the urgelY is (Jimcult. U D, UCU\ and 
,UCD arc the only California hospitals 
which perform liver transplants. 

In an interview with a group of 
waD wnters, who Wished to be iden-
tified by their pen namts, empha-
sized their wide pread suppon. 

"What we arc a king lor I 
tolerance ," Fircfox said. 

Woodstock explained that as 
students experiencing a ademic , 
familial, and personal problems, 
they need to expre s themselves 
somewhere. "Wall writing is a 
form of release ," Woodstock said . 

Gilracl cited the use of "but her 

paper" dunng un-God Fe tlV<l1 , 
where student are allowed to 
write on long StripS of paper, but 
she also added that tho e 
instances arc neverolten enough.

New proposal requires foreign 
T.A.s to take English test 

A new propo al being developed by, 
the UC Ber¥ley OffIce of EducatIonal 
Development will require all foreign 
graduate student teaching aSSIstants to 
take an English oral proficiency test. 

Under the new prop sal, foreign T.A.s 
would be able to fulfill the English 
requirement in one of three ways: by

the Subject A, English for on- ative 
Speakers Program . by achieving a 
mInimum te'it :,core on the Test of 
Spoken EnglIsh , or by passing an

would only affect foreIgn students whose 
teaching dUlles mdude oral IIlstrucuon , 
such as leadmg dISCUSSIon secnons, 
lclboratones. or tutonng IIldlvidual 
students. 

Students who fail to achIeve English 
proficiency would be required to enroll 
111 the Non-Native ubJect A Program.

proposal was dmfted in response to 
student and parent complaints over the 
abIlity of students to understand 
foreIgn T.As. 

Caroline Taux. coordmator of the TA 
Trammg PrOJect , charges that the 
adm1l11strauon IS SImply looking for a

Comedian 
dies on stage 
By JOHN SHAW. Sell/or SWff WilIer 

ComedIan and actor Di k Shawn 
sullered a latal hea n attack Friday nIght 
during a performance before an 
audience of 500 at the Mandeville 
AudItorium . 

Shawn. 63. dIed at 9:55 pm at Scripps 
Memonal HospItal after he collapsed on 
stage at around 8:30 pm, 20 minutes 
into his show. 

He was Icrt lying on-stage for more 
than five Illlllutes bdore it became 
apparent that his collapsc was not pan 
of his routine. A stage hand came out 
twice to check Shawn but apparently 
also did not realize what had 
happcnded . 

Arter the stage hand checked him the 
sccond time , a doctor from the 
audIence, concerned with Shawn's 
heJlth . 1.111 Llnto stage. rolled him onto 
his back, checked his pulse. and began 
CPR 

A third Individual belIeved to be 
Shawn's son , Adam , then asked if there 
wa a doctor present 111 the auditorium. 
Several more people crowded arol1nd 
hawn offering theIr assIstance. 
The audIence was requested to exit 

the auduonum at 8.35 pm. The 
paramedi s were called shonly after. 

At 8"45 pm, campus police arrived at 
the scene. however the pammedics 
didn't arrive until 8:55 pm - 25 m1l1utes 
after Shawn's collapsc. Shawn was 
reponed to still have no pulse at 8'55 
pm though CPR was continued. 

hawn. who seemed in good health 
as he danced around the stage earlier in 
the show, ironically joked about death 
and heart allacks III his routllle Friday 
night. 

During much of the incident, the 
unsuspecting audience laughed, cat-
called, and at one poi nt some 
demanded their money back. 

Shawn worked in nightclubs, on 
televiSion, in theatre, and in movies. He 
appeared in such films as ''The 
Produce rs," "It 's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, 
World ," "Love at First Bi te," and "What 
Did You Do in the War, Daddy?" 

Shawn is survived by his brother and 
four grown children. ~

presldentl,11 election will be held 
ag,lln this Tuesday a nd 
WednesdJ)' When conSidering 
the candidates. we urge you to take 
11110 ac oum a few important 
factors: 

I ) IntegrllY: Dave Fnend's 
plJtform is not one based on 
gllnmicks, n,lshy Issues, or empty 
promises Rathe r, he has a 
trJightforward , comprehenSive 

Jnd Intelligent program which we 
fee l ca n bc Implemented 
successfully in the upcommg year 

2) Experience: Dave Friend has 
serve d student s in various 
cap<.lci ties the past three years at 
UCSD, most recently as Warren 
College Senior Senator, and 
possesses a clear understandmg of 
AS Council mechanics, as well as 
the ability to cut through red tape. 

3) Leadership: Most of us chose 
to run with Dave Friend because of 
thiS quality. He Isa motivator and a 
leader and one who places 
importance on action , rather than 
words. 

4 ) Cohesion. While this is not 
central to our endorsement of 
"Fnendly." wc urge you to take IntO 
onside ratl on the fact that the 

ove rwhelmll1g maJoriry of the new 
A. U.C. .D, Council supports 
David friend and wantS to work 
wi th him 111 order to "starr 10 move"

VO~ Frontenza's newfonnat 
Editor: 

1 am writing to you regarding a 
recem article on alternative media 
(April 6) and a subsequent 
publication by the Voz Frolltcl1za 
(April issue). 

I recently picked up the \/oz 
Frollreriza with a cover of 
"AS.U.C.S.D. ELECTIONS - The 
Candidates, The Issues." The cover 
outlined one viewpoint on a 
referenda question . The inside 
outlined "Quotable Quotes From 
the Other Candidate;" a Single 
candidate , and a slllgie viewpoint. 
Much of this article was maliCIOUS 
and libelous. "Frats now domlllJte 

"A uHl~lT\,{lt n 'c pornpau"

the A.S. and are in bed with the 
administration ," is a typical 
statement fram this article. 

I strongly support alternative 
media, dnd the AS.U,C.S.D. 
allo ated ~5,956.00 to this 
public<ltion, ,rnd 'li37,093.53 TO all

TO stJte my trang disappOll1tment 
and lack of respect for this 
publi ca ti on, however , for 
conceah ng their name on the hadl 
cava of this is ue. Sad I)" I was not 
surprised with the lack of respect 
the students had shown for the Voz 
Frolll em:a . It is this rype of 
de ce ption Jnd propaganda that 
sever,11 "conservative" student s 
stereorype with the alternative 
media, It IS t 0 bad that the Voz 
Frolltcriza is fueling this narrow 
and stereorypical viewpoint in 
their April issue .

San Diego. Plans for the future were 
short on Ideas for preservation 01 
the past. As a result, much 01 what 
was Old Town IS gone . That which 
remains was designated a State 
Hi toric Park In 1967. and It IS now 
a thnvlng part of San Diego. 
mixing heritage with progress. 

The hean of h,stonc Old Town ,

Casa de Bandini . which was 
built in the la le 1820s by Don Juan 
Bandini, a ciVIC and political 
leader, remains in ItS ongillal 
location and IS now a we ll known 
MeXican restaurant. Casa de 
Estudillo. which was built next 
door to Bandini's, was restored in 
the ea rly 1900s and has a history of 
a cente r for community services. It 
was popularized by an 1884 novel , 
Ramol1a, and today is vi rtually 
unknown by any name Olher than 
"Ramona's Marriage Place." Now It 
stands as an example of abode 
architec tu re which was one of [he 
primary styles of the period.

me to expect a t.IP on the shoulder

The house, built by Thomas

complCled in 1857 on a sitc which 
was once the public gallows. 
Al though it is not pa lt o[ the offic ial

Forfeits 
force track 
to fall 
By DA VlD M. SIMONI 

T HE uc D track team headed out to Warren tra k on a chill} and wmdy 
Saturday, Apnl 18 to match their 
Wit against the track squad from 
Wesnnont College. For a squ.ld 
that Wesllnont College cnaches 
dubbed "young and buildmg lor 
the fu ture ." the future 15 now 

Westmont'S mens quad 
defeated UCSD's men b} a 
eonvi ncll1g 86-39 point m.lrgll1 . 
( coring is based on S pOlnt~ for 
first, 3 points for second , 2 pOintS 
for third and 1 pomt for founh ) In 
raw terms thiS means that UC D 
won three evems, while WestmOnt 
College took the remall1mg t\velve . 

The oach for the UCSD 

Bry." uuyeU/ lJlW,dlUli 

runners, Andrew Sklef, 1n\'J[ed 
other sehools and clubs to run In 
the Saturday meet but onl), UCSD 
and Westmont College were 
considered for scan ng by the 
Judges. Tecate Baja, San Diego 
Commul1lt)' College and USD were 
the three unseored paniclpal1l in 
the meet. 

Before the meet began, Sklef 
explained that J[ was gOing to be a 
"low ke )'" day. He couldn 't, 
however, have expected to forfeit 
the longjump , high Jump and both 
the 400M and 1600M rel,lYs, 
putting the UCSD runners at a 
terrible dIsadvantage from the 
beginning. 

Giselle English and Kevin Carter were two bright spots for UCSD in an otherwise dismal day at the races. 

In lIght of thiS, klei was 
accurate in hiS asse sment of the 
situatlon. "We have an even 
distribution of age," he said , "but 
Just not enough depth to field all of 
the events." UCSD's demandll1g 
scholastic curriculum and naggll1g 

Timeout 

injuries to many of his best lunners 
are t\VO reasons kid gives for hiS 
"diluted squad ." 

Although it was grey and foggy 
throughout the events, the day was 
not without sunshll1e for the 
Tntons UCSD had wll1ners in the 
shot put and the 400~1 and 1500M 
races. Will erscnder/or, a Junior 
transfer student from Fremont, 
California , wJlked away from hiS 
wmnmg shot put toSS (39'3") 
remarkll1g: " ot bad for a rookie ." 
In the 400M race, Tim Kyser, after 
leadmg the whole wa)', was able to 

Schmidt thinks the Mets 
could face a tough season 

Do you think the Mets WIll 
repeat this year) Well , Mike 
Schmidt certainly doesn't. Here is 
his reasoning: "Nowadays, if you 
don't carry yourself a cenain way in 
the face of victory, everybody in 
baseball is gonna want to get you. 
And let me tell you, I know all the 
players m baseball want to get the 
Mets. You know all thos€' fights 

they were in last year? That'll be 
nothing compared to the way 
everybod y feels about them th is 
year .. . If they win again , the Mets 
arc gonna be one 01 the greatest 
teams in the history of baseball." 

From a survey of managers 
conducted by Sparting News, here 
are baseball's best staners: N.L. , 
Fernando Valenzuela; A.L. Roger 

hold on and beat the approaching 
Westmont runners, JndJeff Caner 
took the ISOOM for the Tritons. 
And Jell Rubll1 , UCSD's standout 
spn nter, took two vcry close 
seco nd pbcc fl l1l shes 111 both rhe 
100M and 200M m cs 

The women of UCSD did nOt 
fdlr much be tter agall1st theIr 
opponent ,falli ng to the women of 
Westmont College bya score of SO-

tcam affected th e girls '

The girls squad ha good 
runners, just nOt enough ,f them. 
Heidi Bye rs is a strong n 1I1er for 
the Tritons who ran wei n both 
the 200M and the 100M ' pri nting 
evellts. Another good display was 
given by Giselc Engli sh in her

by saying: "who knows what evil 
lurks in the heans of men excepr

Aftcr bei ng asked why he never

he said: "Don't you know I'm a

Mountain hesh Rainiers 
Sighted Near Palm Springs 

Dr. Heinrich Tschutter of'the Beaumont Citizens' Committee on Carbonated Phenomena displays a recent photograph of' a Rainier seen near Indio. 

SAN BERNARDINO - New sighlings of Mountain Fresh 
Rainier. across much of Southern California have now been 
confinned by several unbiased sources, according to Dr. 
Heinrich Tschuner. chairman of the Beaumont Citizens ' 
Commiuee on Carbonaled Phenomena. Tschuuer told a hast-
ily-called press conference in Escondido yesterday that 
MFR 's have been "positi vely identified" in the region near 
the Joshua Tree National Monument. And. he added. sight-
ings in Los Angeles and San Diego "are just a maner 
of time." 

Rumors concerning the imminent appearance of MFR's in 
the area have been circulating for months. and yesterday's 
press conference was obviously designed to dispel all doubts . 
Appearing with Tschuner were several eyewitnesses and in-
dependenl experts. many of whom brought authentic-looking 
photographs. 

Mary Elizabeth Welkins, shown here with her hus-
hand Leonardo, told newsmen : •• All I know is I 
saw the things, and that 's it." 

Wally " Buzz" Entropo shows sketches of 
Mountain Fresh Rainiers he made along the 
Kings River during 1985_ 

" Thi~ time they ('an be Identified ab,olutely." claimed Dr. 
T\chutter. " Rainiers arc of two distinct species - onc Ihat ap-

pear~ tn be ~hiny am] metallic . and i, almo,t perfectly cy-
lindrical. The other is dar~ brown. translucenl . and abo 
cylindrical. but with a protruding neck or cap." 

Tschuller ,aid that the marking, 01' both speCie, were ai -
mo~t identical : a IlIrge red "R" in ,crip .. followed by the 
word " ainier:' the cumbination Ihought to refer In the moun-
tain up in Wa,hington State. traditionally con,idered the 
place of origin for a)) MFR.,. . But OIher ex per" challenged 
T,chuller\ interpretdtion . ~everal conjecturtng that " ainier"

" Bu,," Entmpo. an MI"R-trader I()rova 20 ycar~ . who 
c laim, to haw lived among one group 01 Ralllier~ in Ihe n:-
mOle China Lake region . 

" I' ve cven ta>lcd them." ~tated Entropo . "and rille)) you , 
they arc friendly and extrcmely n:fre~hing. But I found no cvi-
uem:c wnvincing llIe Ihatthe 'R' and 'ainler' together make 
up any larger word ."

Other eyewitnesses who spoke included Leonardo and 
Mary Elizabeth Welkins of the Big Bear Lake area . The We/-
kinses claim to halle seen as many as six Rain ier~ at one time. 
.. It was just before dark." said the retired aceou ntan/. " We 
were walking next to this horse corral. Sudden ly the horse 
began kicking and whinneying . Dogs began to howl. Mary 
Elizabeth shouted . ' 1 ,ee it! I see it!' 

.• As we got closer, we could make out sill of them in very 
tight formation . They were the brown ones. and we could 
read the ' R"" on thcir sides clear a~ day. They made no 
sounds as they charged past us." 

Dr. Tschullcr visited the couple a few days after the sight-
ing was reported . " When I left ." he said . " I was more puz-
zled than when I arrived : ' becau~e the Welkinsc, were the 
tir!>! to report multip le MFR \ . " But they obviously didn't 
make up the story'" 

Noncthclc,,, . the Welkinscs look a lerri/ic ribbing from 
their friend,. they reported . " Even Illy mOl her scotTed at us ," 
said Mr~ . Wclkin~ . " Thing~ were prclly unbeerable for a 
while , but all I know i, I saw the thing, . and thm 's il.· · 

All the ... peaker, agrced that Rainiers are friendly to hu-
man~ . and arc even thought to impart a feeling of refreshment 
and well -hcing to tho!>C with whom they come in contac/. 
T~chullcrconcluded by _aying Ihatllluhiple MFR sightings 
had ,inec been verified by. among others. Karen Alweil. a 21 -
year-old college ~lUdeni . and it law enforcement ofticer who 
preferred 10 remain anonymou\ . 

"We can all ellpect (0 , ee Rainicr~ throughout Southern 
California in the w~eb to come. all the way from Fresno to 
La Me,a '" " lid 'I\ chuncr. ·· nd I. fur onc. am as pleased as I 
can he '" 

These remains, thought be left by MFR's, were 
found near Lake Arrowhead,
