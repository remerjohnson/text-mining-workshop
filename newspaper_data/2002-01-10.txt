A.S. Council rasses 
controversia resolution 
Freedom Alliance alleges partisanism, 
mistreatment by student representatives 
By MARGARET O'NEILL 
Senior Staff Writer 

A highly amended version of the 
"Pro-America Resolution," origi-
nally submitted by the Freedom 
Alliance/P ro-America Coa lition, 
passed the AS. Council by a vote of 
15 to 3, with two abstentions at the 
Nov. 28 meeting. The resolution 
and the debate surrounding it 
raised questions about possible par-
tisan tendencies of the A.S. 
Council. . 

The resolution passed was titled 
"Resolution Supporting America's 
Institutions." It includes six clauses, 
primarily honoring the servicemen 
and women, police officer and 
firefighter involved in the Sept. 11 
crisis and its aftermath. 

All mention of the American 
flag, as originally included in the 
version submitted by the Freedom 
Alliance/Pro-America Coali tion, 
was removed when the bill went 
through amendment by the coun-
cil. 

The AS. Council passed the 
"Anti-Hate Resolution" at the 
Sept. 26 meeting, which responded 
to the Sept. 11 attacks. That resolu-
tion reaffirmed the UCSD 
Principles of Community and con-
demned acts of hate. 

The recently formed Freedom 

Alliance/Pro-America Coalition is 
composed of the Marksmanship 
Club, the Unified Campus 
Coalition, the UCSD Conservative 
Union, the College Republicans, 
The California Review and 280 
UCSD students via a petition drive. 

Vince Vasquez, UCSD 
Conservative Union spokesman, 
said he feels the "Resolution 
Supporting America's Institutions" 
as passed does not match the inten-
tions of his organization. The 
UCSD Conservative Union chal-
lenged the actions of the A.S. 
Council on the issne. 

"The memher of the Freedom 
Alliance have been more than will-
ing to 'compromise,' which includ-
ed a lot of us giving in and them 
taking, not giving, and the fact that 
they thought they could simply 
sneak these amendments through is 
disturbing," Vasquez said. "They 
paid no notice to the 280 signatures 
collected over four days supporting 
this resolution, but rather their 
personal political ideologies. The 
question must be asked,. ' Is the 
UCSD student government really 
representing the students of 
UCSD?' " 

The UCSD Conservative 
Union expressed disapproval of the 
amendments to their submitted 
resolution. 

"We asked the A.5. to support 
our national flag, which embodies 
our national ideals of freed om and 
unity and democracy, " Vasquez 
said. "Vice Presidents Dylan de 
Kervor and Jenn Brown expressed 
their disapproval of the flag, and ill 
public meetings degraded it to a 
symbol of oppression , murder, 
racism and bigotry. It is also the 
opinion of the supporters of the 
Resolution tllat throughout the 8th 
and lOth week A.S. Council meet-
ings, we were treated like chi ldren 
with inane needs and concern~, 
having to be handl ed, controlled, 
patronized by the A.S. Cou ncil 
leadership. Their suppOrt fo r the 
hostile amendments dishonor the 
millions of men and women, who, 
in the last cenmry alone; ra ll ied 
under the American fl ag as a sym-
bol of freedom, including my own 
grandfather. " 

A.S . Vice President External 
Dylan icole de Kervor stressed 
her involvement in the negotiations 
over the amendments to the resolu-
tion . 

"1 saw it as a situation of com-
promise," she said . "To call us 
childish when we met them on 
every claim is unfounded. "

Dynes cancels commencement for good 
By DANA WEST 
Senior Staff Writer 

Chancellor Robert C. Dynes 
announced L ~t month the cancel-
lation of' all -campus commence-
ment ceremonies after a four-year 
trial program. 

"Our longstanding tradition of 
separate undergraduate college 
commencement ceremonies is a 
meaningful way for our new grad-
uates to celebrate with their class-
mates and loved ones, and that 

tradition will continue- to cap off 
each academic year at UCSD," 
Dynes said. 

The all-campus graduation 
ceremony was launched as a four-
year pilot project by the UCSD 
administration in 1997. The cere-
mony has endured several difficul-
ties in past years, including the 
late cancellation of Maya Angelou 
in 2000. She was replaced by San 
Diego businessman Irwin Jacobs.

More food: Rubio's Baja Grill will soon begin serving the UCSD cOInmunity from its 
new Price Center location. WendY s will reopen soon after some renovations. 

By CARLAN WENDER 
Senior Staff Writer 

Renovations of Price Center 
eateries have left only two operat-
ing eateries open, causing long 
lines that force many patrons to 
change their lunch-time plans. 

"I was going to eat [at Wendy'S), 
but Subway is the only acceptable 
alternative," said Price Center 
patron Cameron Jackson. 

Kitchen renovations forced 

Wendy's to temporarily close over 
winter break. Work was expected to 
be completed on Wnedy's by last 
Monday, but weather problems on 
the East Coast prevented shipment 
of a critical piece of equipment to 
San Diego, according to Gary

would be the starting point for any 
decisions made about the future of the 
ceremony. 

Dodge said the A.S. Council has 
spent much of this year looking into 
possible alternatives to all -campus 
commencement. 

"Ideally. and of course. we contin-
ue to support some kind of all-campus 
event at the end of the year for 
seniors," he said. 

Dodge said this event. which is still 
in the planning stages. would allow 
seniors from all colleges to convene 
and celebrate their achievements in a 
more informal setting, alleviating the 
pressure on graduates and their fami-
lies to attend two ceremonies in one 
day. 

"Graduates and their families 
were not interested in attending two 
ceremonies," D odge said . 
"Especially not one in which none of 
their achievements would be recog-
nized." 

The A.S. Council has a meeting 
scheduled next week to go over possi-
bilities for this alternative celebration 
with the administration. The dates for 
four of the five colleges' graduation 
ceremonies have already been decided 
upon.

UCSD scientists finds genetic 
link to cardiac death 

A gene discovered to playa role in heart failure 
has been cloned by UCSD's Institute of Molecular 
Medicine. 

The gene, Kv Channel-Interacting Protein 2, is 
said to cause the irregular heartbeats that can ulti-
mately lead to sudden cardiac death. KChlP2 regu-
lates the electrical currents that cause the human 
heart to sustain a nonnal rhythmic beat 

UCSD IMM scientists demonstrated the genetic 
link by cloning KChlP2 and then breeding mice that 
were deficient of the gene. Vvhile these mice did not 
physically display any Irregularity in basic functions. a 
sinRie extra heartbeat by a mouse led to a sustained 
malignant heart rhythm that would typically cause 
sudden death in humans. 

IMM director Dr. Kenneth R Chien headed the 
study. which was recently published in the Dec. 14, 
2001 issue of Cell. 

. UCSD lab tests could aid in 
development of AI DS drugs 

Researchers at the UCSD School of Medicine 
and Veterans Administration San Diego Healthcare 

System have developed a new test that enables the 
measurement of molecular components during 
HIVs initial contact with a human cell. 

The new test allows scientists to study and 
desi~n new compounds that halt the infection of the 
virus molecular compounds. 

The groundbreaking method will allow 
researchers to test newly designed drugs that work 
to restrain enzymes that lead to the spread of H IV 
throughout the cell. While there is no medicine that 
has yet been approved to prevent the virus from 
splicing its DNA into the host cell, scientists are opti-
mistic that this new testing method will allow the 
development of such drugs. 

Last month, the GlaxoSmithKline phannaceutical 
company awarded a Drug DiscDvery and 
Development Award to the study's senior author, Dr. 
Richard Kombluth, who is also a UCSD associate 
professor of medicine. 

The study was printed in the December 200 I 
issue of the Journal of Biochemistry Medicine. 

First discovery announced of a 
planet orbiting a giant star 

Three UCSD astronomers were involved in a 
major scientific discovery announced Wednesday at 
a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in 
Washington. 

Sabine Frink, David S. Mitchell and Andreas 
Quirrenbach, all from UCSD's Center for 
Astrophysics and Space Science, joined UC 
Berkeley's Debra A. Fisher and Geoffrey W. Marcy, 
and Camegie Institution of Washington's Paul Butler 
in discovenng the first planet orbiting a giant star. 

The star, Iota Draconis, is a very Old star that has 
already bumed all of the hydrogen fuel in its core 
and had grown to a radiu$ 13 times that of the sun. 

This is a significant discovery because it provides 
the first evidence that planets at an earthlike dis-
tance can survive the evolution of their host star into 
a giant star, according to Frink, a postdoctoral 
researcher at UCSD. 

Iota Draconis is located 100 light years from 
Earth and is visible with an unaided eye in the mom-
ing sky. It can be seen just east of the Big Dipper in 
the constellation of Draco. 

Our heart-felt condclences go out to The Daily Aztec staff as well 
as the friends and family of Gregory Uthgoe (1981-200 I). the Aztec

U C seeks to recover funds 
lost froIn Enron's downfall 
Class action suit alleges executives misled investors 
and reaped millions from illegal insider transactions 
By GEOFF DIETRICH 
News Editor 

In an effort to recover the near-
ly $145 million lost when the price 
of Enron stock plummeted last fall. 
the U niversi ty of Cali fornia has 
recently joined a class action law-
suit against 29 top executives of the 
company and its accounting firm. 
Arthur Andersen. LLP. 

The lawsuit alleges that the 
executives - including form: r 
CEOs - and the accounting firm 
"engaged in massive insider trading 
while issuing false and misleading 
financial statements about the 
company's purportedly 'record' 
results and strong operating per-
formance." 

Executives who were aware of 
the true financial situation. accord-
ing to the lawsuit. sold over 17 mil-
lion shares for over $1 .1 billion 
between Oct. 19. 1998 and Nov. 
27. 200 I. Throughout the majority 
of this time. the company reported 
a sound financial outlook. 

"The allegation is that company 
was misrepresenting its profit and 
debt by pushing debt and losses to 
its partnerships." said UC counsel 
Christo,pher Patti. "It's a problem 
when [the defendants] are doing 
that at a time when material infor-
mation about the company is being 
withheld from the public." 

The H ouston-based company 
be.came the nation's seventh largest 
corporation through a broad-based 
business strategy centered around 

the trading of natural gas and elec-
tricity. 

A spokesman for Arthur 
Andersen. LLP referred all com-
ment to CEO Joe Berardino's Dec. 
12 testimony to the U.S. House of 
Representatives Committee on 
Financial Services. 

Calls to Enron were unre-
turned. 

Berardino told the committee 
that most information regarding 
the restatement of financial infor-

"The University of 
California lost $144.7 
million when Enron's 
stock price fell from 
a high of $90.75 per 
share." 

mation was withheld from 
Andersen. but some information 
was not released due to an "honest 
error." 

Enron is currently under inves-
tigation by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. the Labor 
and Justice departments and con-
gressional committees regarding 
any wrongdoing owing to its fall 
into bankruptcy. 

So far. there have been no crim-
inal charges fil ed against anybody 
associated with the bankruptcy or 
the company. 

On Dec. 21. the University of 
California joined the lawsuit. which 

was originally filed Dec. 5 by the 
national firm of Milberg, Weiss. 
Bershaq., Hynes & Lerach, LLP on 
behalf of Amalgamated Bank. 

There are many suits alleging 
various illegal dealings associated 
with the Enron downfall. The 
University of California chose to 
sign on to the Milberg complaint 
because of the firm's expertise and 
past performance in class action lit-
igation, according to Patti. 

Because the various suits are 
currently being consolidated into 
one single class action suit, the 
University of California petitioned 
to have Milberg serve as lead coun-
sel. T his would allow the 
University of California to have a 
greater role in the eventual dis-
bursement of any recovered funds 
if the suit is successful. Patti said. 

T he University of California 
lost $144.7 million when Enron's 
stock price fell from a high of 
$90.75 per share. Approximately-
$94 million of that was from the 
UC Retirement Fund. 

The University of California 
sold its Enron holdings in 
November 2001. The losses result-
ing from the failed Enron stock will 
not affect the ability of the fund to 
meet its obligations to beneficia-
ries. stated David Russ. treasurer to 
the UC Board of Regents. 

The University of Californias 
total investment in Enron com-
prised of three-tenths of I percent 
of the total UC investment portfo-
lio. which is valued at $54 billion.

changed from the original form 
to focus on the contributions of 
servicemen. The amendments. as 
well as removing mention of the 
flag and George W. Bush's name. 
elaborated on the support for 
members of the military and ser-
vice corps. 

"In no way does support for 
the amendments proposed by [de 
Kervor] 'dishonor the milIions of 
men and women, who, in the last 
century alone. rallied under the 
American flag as a symbol of free-

[the passed resolution] clearly 
states that 'we honor the men and

our nation; as well as our fellow 
peers. as ROTC and enlisted per-
sonnel, having joined the military 
to seek out opportunity. access to 
education. and a better way of 
life. whom must now answer the 
call of their nation .... said A.S. 
Vice President Internal Jenn 
Brown. 

The omission of language 
involving the flag is centerfold to 
the controversy over the resolu-
tion. 

"Myself and the A.S. Council 
in no way meant any disrespect to 
our nation or our nation's flag in 
wanting that portion of the reso-
lution deleted." said A.S. 
President Jeff Dodge. "Students 
had expressed concern over the 
necessity of slJch a statement 
when the alleged intent of the 
resolution was not one of evoking 
patriotism and 'Pro America' sen-
timents. Rather. the Freedom 
Alliance ought appreciation and 
respect for our nation's institu-

tiOIlS. especialIy those most 
effected by both the war against 
terrorism in Afghanistan and the 
destruction of Sept. II ." 

De Kervor pushed her view 
that the fla g should not be includ-
ed to the Senate. 

"I didn't think the American 
flag should have been included," 
she said . "The same fla g has 
fl own over plantations and 
internmen~ camps." 

Resolutions are passed by 
votes by the senators. a body of 20 
students within the A.S. Council. 
including four from each of the 
five colleges. The amended reso-
lution was passed by IS senators. 
The three who voted against it 
were Warren Junior Senator 
Lauren Lee, Muir Sophomore 
Senator Ruba Bataniji and 
Revelle Freshman Senato r 
Joachim Lyon. Their reasons for 
opposition varied. 

"For the most part 1 voted 'no ' 
on the resol ution beca use I fel t 
the legislation was superfluous 
and unnecessary." Lyon said . 
"When I passed by the public sig-
nature booth on Library Walk I 
found that I agreed wi th almost 
every point made in the resolu-
tion. However. I firmly believe 
that it was not necessary to pass 
such a resolution, considering the 
fact that one has already been 
passed regarding support for 
those people directly involved in 
the attacks on Sept. I I." 

Members of the council said 
the amendment of the resolution 
was so it would represent the 
majority of their constiruents, the 
srudents. 

Batanij i said she feels that even 
the amended version did not 
accomplish this. 

"I opposed the resolution in 
the interest of preserving freedom 
of opinion for UCSD students."

were wild successes - then-President Bill 
Clinton spoke at the first one, and then-
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich spoke 
at the next one. 

The problems the commencement com-
mittees faced the next two years are well-
known: Since Gingrich spoke, the process 
by which the speakers were found has been 
mjred by cancellations and lackluster inter-
est. The last two years' speakers have been 
San Diego tech-mogul Irwin Jacobs and 
inspirational.speaker Patch Adams, who was 
made famous by a biographical Robin 
Williams movie. 

Though the ceremony has not attracted 
speakers of the same caliber as the first two, 
we at the Guardian think the ceremony 
should have been kept and made perma-
nent. In his announcement Dynes stated 
that the separate ceremonies at the individ-
ual colleges are intended to allow new 
UCSD graduates to "celebrate with their 
classmates and loved ones." However, these 
ceremonies exclude about five-sixths of our 
classmates. 

In a time of explosive enrollment increas-
es at UCSD, the five colleges are no longer 
the tight-knit communities they once may 
have been. Lower-classmen are often 
housed at colleges other than their own, and 
now second-year students are not even 
guaranteed on-campus housing. Each year, 
the campus is becoming more and more a 
single community. This is not necessarily 
problematic, but it is a shame that com-
mencement will no longer represent this 
aspect ofUCSD. 

Virtually all students have friends outside 
their colleges, and some may even dislike 
the nature of their own college's ceremony. 
For example, T hurgood Marshall College 
allows students to bring their parents across 
the stage with them. Thjs can present prob-
lems for students, perhaps making them feel 
obliged to bring their parents to the stage 
with them, or for students who have non-
traditional nuclear families or separated 
parents. To some, the small nature of their 
college'S ceremony may seem just that -
small. A traditional all-campus ceremony 
provides all graduates with an alternative. 

There are so many ways that we as stu-
dents come in contact with each other 
besides at our colleges. We make friends in 
our classes, student organizations, churches, 
sports teams - in countless ways. 

It is a shame that some have placed the 
importance of the commencement speaker 
before the importance of students who wish 
to graduate with their classmates of choice. 
The Guardian urges Chancellor Dynes to 
reconsider his decision to cancel this valu-
able opportunity for us to share our gradu-
ation experience with all of our fellow class-
mates. We hope that at the very least, the 
money and resources that would have gone 
to the all-campus commencement ceremo-
ny will be given to the individual colleges so 
that their ceremonies will not seem so, well, 
small.

Fighting the wrong battle: the 
problems with preferential treatment 
While commendable in intent, rally revealed 

flaws in pro-affirmative action argument 
By DANIEL WArn 
Staff Writer 

Various campus groups came togeth-
er during fall quarter in the Price Center 
to rally in support of race-based prefer-
ences, asking for the reinstatement of the 
race factor in UC admissions policy in 
order to increase minority enrollment. 

They were wrong in doing so. 
Attempting to justify their position, 

the groups hung a banner making the 
self-contradictory claim "Race must be a 
factor because racism is a factor." 

Racism, however, is not a factor in 
UC admissions policy because the cur-
rent policy has been colorblind since the 
passage of Proposition 209. If race were 
again to become a factor in the admis-
sions process, as they propose, then 
racism (defined as granting preferential 
neaonent based solely on race) would 
"be a factor." Racism cannot exist in a 
process in which race is not a considera-
tion. 

The approximately 85 participating 
students nodded knowingly when a 
speaker proclaimed that the voices of 
affirmative action supporters and peo-
ple of color "are not heard in class or 
administrative meetings." The speaker 
then refuted her own claim when she 
introduced Ross Frank of UCSD's eth-
nic srudies department - the chair of 
the administrative Committee of 
Mfirmative Action and Diversity, which 
reports directly to the chancellor. With 
such a clear link to Chancellor Dynes, 
it is folly to argue t~at the. administra-
non Ignores affirmanve acnon support-
ers. Indeed, if any voices are ignored by 
the administration, they are the voices 
of affirmative action opponents. 

As for the assertion that people of 
color are ignored on this campus, one 
may be directed to the Cross Culrural 
Center, the African American Srudent 
Union, McCha, IUibigang Philippino or 
one of the dozens of other ethnic and 
culrural clubs and organizations. The 
very existence of a pro-affinnative action ( 

rally, sponsored by the Srudent 
Affirmative Action Coalition (in which 
many culrural groups participate), proves 
that their voices are indeed heard loud 
and clear. 

The voices of the crowd were defi-
nitely heard when they booed the words 
of one presenter who enumerated some 
of the criticisms made by those who 
oppose giving free rides to certain racial 
groups. 

Among the offending statements: 
"People say we must work harder!" 

It is an honorable goal to 
increase UCSD's diversity. 
But racial preferences are 

not a fair means of 
accomplishing this. 

Granting preferential 
treatment to a certain 

racial group serves only to 
foster cynicism among 

members of other races. If 
any racial discord exists, 
such programs will only 

deepen the divide. 

Heaven forbid anyone should engage 
in hard work. 

Another orator strangely departed 
from the prevailing theme of "hooray 
for affirmative action" and instead con-
demned the Price Center's architec-
ture. He remarked that the Price 
Center's layout does not promote com-
munity - nay, it promotes the twin 
evils of a totalitarian "police state" and 
capitalism. It is unforrunate that the 
speaker decided to lump capitalism, the 
free system under which he prospers, 
with a "police state," a system that he 
has likely never experienced. If he 
wishes to experience a police state for 

bi~sclf, pubaps ~o .~r~~ ~s 

resolve against the evil capitalists who 
built the Price Center, he may want to 
visit one of Earth's few remaining 
police states - Vietnam, Cuba, North 
Korea or China are excellent choices 
- which are, coincidentally, not capi -
talist. 

It is an honorable goal to increase 
UCSO's diversity. But racial prefer-
ences are not a fair means of accom-
plishing this. Granting preferential 
treatment to a certain racial group 
serves only to foster cynicism among 
members of other races. If any racial 
discord exists, such programs will only 
deepen the divide. 

What should be done to increase 
diversity is community outreach and the 
expansion of the "4 percent plan." 

Poverty-stricken schools with poor 
teachers are unsuitable learning envi-
ronments because srudents are put at an 
academic disadvantage. Applicants from 
these schools don't have the benefit of 
padded GPAs from AP courses or the 
help of S.A. T preparation classes, so 
they can't hope to compete against sru-
dents in high-income neighborhoods. If 
the top 4 percent of every California 
high school were guaranteed admittance 
to a university, minority enrollment 
would increase without discriminating 
against anyone. 

UC personnel should strive to 
make poor high school students aware 
of the possibility of UC enrollment. 
Many high-achieving, low-income 
minorities don't bother to apply to the 
University of California believing they 
have no chance of acceptance or no 
hope of affording ruition. They may 
not know about the 4 percent plan, or 
they could be ignorant of the scholar-
ships and financial aid available. 
Outreach to these high school srudents 
would increase the diversity of quali -
fied UC applicants, thereby increasing 
the diversity of UC students. 

The protesters at the rally had good

Editor: 

In regards to The Konln Volume 
58, Issue 2, page 7: I am Jewish. I 
hold no official position in the 
Jewish community or represent a 
Jewish organization. 

The Koala's character of a Jew 
is anti-Semitic and racist. The 
creature is disgraceful. Wearing a 
wide-rimmed hat with long, curly 
sideburns as if he is an Orthodox 
Jew inappropriately juxtaposes a 
great tradition. This juvenile part 
of the cartoon is little compareJ 
to the perversion of the Menorah 
and the Magen David (Sta r of 
David). Priests used the menorah 

in temple worship in ancient 
lsrael. In modern times, it is com-
mon in synagogues and used in 
observance of Chanukah. 
Depicting this symbol as an 
instrument of violence shows a 
complete lack of respect of the 
Jewish people, and even if not 
intended, anti-Semitism. 

The Star of David has taken 
several meanings and connotations 
in Judaism. During World War II 
and the Holocaust, Jews were 
forced to wear badges with the Star 
of David so that the Nazis could 
identify and isolate Jews from the 
rest of society. The Zionist move-
ment adopted it in 1897; and now it 
is on the Israeli flag. The Star of 
David functions to simplify the 
image of the beast as Jewish 
because the symbol is commonly 
identifiable. 

The cartoon depicts Jews as 
beast-like, and consequently sub-
human. The fu ndamental ele-
ment of racism is the belief that 
one human is less human than 
another is. I would like to believe 
that this is not the intention of 
The Kania. 

r would like to believe that pro-
paganda would stop by tapping my 
feet. But I am not in Kansas any-
more, and I don't have a pair of 
ruby slippers to get me out. What I 
do have is 4,000 years of history 
telling me that perversion of sacred 
symbols and racist cartoons depict-
ing me as subhuman cannot be 
ignored.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

Shameful hypocrisy alive 
and well on campus 
Calling The Koala racist, but finding its 
'jokes liumorous, is unethical and unjust 

By KECIA R. FELTON 
Staff Writer 

How can we blame The KOIIIII? 
No one should be attempting 

to shut Tbe Kotila down. No one. 
The KOIIIII should have the right 
and the power to publish unstifled 
opinions and ideas as a publica-
tion explicitly protected under 
the provisions of the First 
Amendment. The First 
Amendment is designed to pro-
tect speech that is unpopular in 
our society, for if every word spo-
ken or printed were favorable, 
there would be no need for the 
protection of free speech at all. 
The Kunlll, with all of its racially 
insensitive epithets, absolutely 
qualifies for such protection. 

I am not condoning the hate 
speech spewed within the pages 
of The Koak In fact, 1 find the 
content within the newspaper 
disgusting, and as an African 
American, quite offensive. But 
just as the Gllnrdian has a right to 
go to press, likewise for the M1Iir 
QUIlrttrly and all other srudent 
publications, Tbe KOIIIII staff has a 
right to put into print whatever its 
derogatory and racists hearts 
desire (oops, did I let that slip?). 

My problem is not with Tbe 
KOllla. My problem is not with The 
KOllla editor in chief George 
Liddle, either. My problem is with 
the thousands of UCSD srudents 

who claim to not be racist but 
laugh at the denigrating filth that 
permeates throughout The KOIIIII. 
On Nov. 30, The KOIIIII staff dis-
tributed what seemed to be a mil-
lion copies of their paper around 
campus. That Friday, I spotted 
srudents of various ethnicities gig-

My problem is not 
with The Koala. My 
problem is not with 
The Koala editor-in-
chief George Lidd le,

The Koala. 

gling to themselves. A few sru-
dents were holding up their '.:opies 
to their friends exclaiming, "Read 
this'" with generic smiles plas-
tered across their faces. Now, it 
goes without saying Tbt Konln is 
racist. They have refu ted this 
claim extensively, but anyone with 
half a hrain can see that the social-

Iy constructed institution of 
racism is upheld on Tbe Koala's 
pages. That said, if you were one 
of those people whom I spotted 
around campus laughing, giggling 
- even mustering a pathetic 
s;rule - ask yo~rself ~~is ques-
tion : "Am I a raCISt, lOO, 

Before you answer with the 
popular answer, "I [ell no!," think 
about a few things. 

If you happened upon a Ku 
Klux Klan rally and caught your-
self cheering at the racist utter· 
ances of an Imperial Wizard, are 
you in agreement with the KKK? 
If you happened upon an issue of 
Tbe Koala and caught you rself 
laughing at the racist rants of 
Liddle, are you in agreement with 
The Koala' Now try again : "Am I 
a racist, too'" The popular answer 
should not be quite so easy to 
mutter this time. 

If no one attends Klan rallies, 
then soon enough even the hate-
preaching Imperial Wizard has no 
foundation on which to stand. 
Similarly, if no one reads The 
Koaln, then the srudent organiza-
tions for civil rights would not 
have to contend with its attacks 
due to lack of readership - Tbe 
Koala would be forced to shut 
down. But if, on the other hand, 
you read and shamelessly grin at 
the contents of Tbe Koala, then

Message to the campus from the Diversity Council: 

The Diversity Council commends 
the UCSD students and their 

representatives who have expressed 
disapproval of The Koalas abusive and 

disrespectful language, while defending 
freedom of speech and the press. 

Such language is inconsistent with 
our campus Principles of Community 
and offensive to the vast majority of 

the campus. We urge everyone to s'peak ' 
out against such disrespectful behavior.

intentions - increasing diversity 
and providing educational oppor-
tunities for minorities - but they 
were going about it the wroog way. 
Full of contradictions, half-truths 
and logical fallacies, the pro-affi r-
mative action rally succeeded only 
in making the participants look 
naive and uninformed. Flinging 
haphazard condemnations at the 
administration, capitalism, the 
Price Center and hard work is not 
the way to convince everyone of 
affirmative action 's glory. 

Koala: 
Racist speech has no 
place on campus 
Continued from page 5 
racism - however humorous it 
may seem - has found an active 
participant in you. 

The Koala has every right under 
the Constitution to print and dis-
tribute its hateful content. The 
UCSD student body should not 
attempt to constrain or revoke its 
First Amendment right of free 
speech . 

But the student body should 
voice a counter-opinion of its own 
that dilutes the power behind Tbe 
Koala's message. Our student body 
needs to stop straddling the fence 
whenever diversity is concerned 
and take an active stance to wel-
come and celebrate its underrepre-
sented population. 

All students - whites included 
- need to ensure that the The 
Koala feels the rejection it has 
earned because racism cuts away at 
the core of human rights, not just 
civil rights. 

When The Koala distributors are 
around campus handing out the lat-
est edition of steaming garbage, 
turn them down. 

When you see abandoned 
Koalas lying around campus, put 
them in a recycling bin so that oth-
ers who do not seek such offensive 
material do not inadvertently hap-
pen upon a copy. Better yet, set up 
barbecues on Library Walk and 
invite people to torch their copy 
alongside you. 

But if you are not racist - and 
you probably claim not to be -
then don't laugh at racist speech. 
Don't snicker at sexist suggestions. 
Don't support a publication that 
operdy embraces ethnic denigra-
tion and gender stereotyping if you 
do not share these beliefs. 

The /(oqla is not the problem -
everyone who claims to be offend-
ed by its content out of one side of 
their face but laughs about it out of 
the other side are the real problems 
at this school.

Renovations.: 
Wendy's to resume 
business next week 
Continued from page 1 
double their capacity," Ratcliff 
said. "The bottleneck [in service) 
was in the kitchen." 

Wendy's management was 
unavailable for comment, but 
patrons can expect a resumption of 
service on Jan. 14, Ratcliff said. 

The disruption of service is felt 
especially hard in a food court 
that is missing its Mexican cuisine 
representation. Since the closure 
of Tia Molly's after spring quarter 
2001, the Price Center has gone 
without any replacement venue. 

Last quarter and continuing 
through January, Rubio's Baja Grill 
has been under construction. It was 
scheduled to replace longtime 
Price Center tenant Tia Molly's in 
the food court. 

Marcus Fischer, project manag-
er for the Rubio's expansion, esti-
mates that they will be "finishing 
[construction) at the end ofJanuary 
and opening in the beginning of 
February." 

Footing the bills for all this 
expansion are the vendors them-
selves. 

"Any alteration or tenancy 
improvements are funded by the 
tenants in addition to their rent," 
Ratcliff said. 

The university employs ordy 
leasing contract negotiations to 
entice vendors to improve their 
tenements, Ratcliff said. 

Student opinions on the addi-
tion of Rubio's are mixed. 

Arturo Medina sees Rubio's as 
"a fake Mexican place replacing a 
falee Mexican place." 

Others are more complimentary 
about the restaurant. 

"I like Rubio's," said junior 
transfer James Roh. 

On a broader level, both the 
administration and some students 
have plans and desires for changes 
to talee place in the Price Center. 

"In the long-run, expansion has 
to happen," Ratcliff said. "We're 
going to have more seating and 
more vendors. Students have to 
wait too long [for service)." 

This year, more seats have been 
added to accommodate the increase 
in Price Center patrons. 

Another issue is the expansion 
of the Price Center to facilitate 
more vendors. Last year's measure 
to fund a Price Center expansion 
failed in the largest voter turnout 
in recent UCSD history. Though a 
task force led and largely filled by 
students is currently working to 
procure a more permanent resolu-
tion, planners are left to find space 
from what currently exists on cam-
pus. 

New and replacement vendors 
are selected by polling students to 
get their opinions on what restau-
rants should be pursued to fill 
vacancies and what values students 
hold for the qua Ii ty, cost and con-
venience of buying food in the 
Price Center. 

In the case of the vacancy 
opened by Tia Molly's departure, 
Rubio's had the most votes, though 
other vendors were invited. 

Baja Fresh and Wahoo's were 
considered by the University 
Centers, but neither was able to 
make a commitment, Ratcliff 
said. 

Other changes on the horizon 
for the Price Center food court 
involve Subway and Wok's Up. 
Subway will be adding a second 
sandwich preparation line to facil-
itate quicleer food service. 

The lease for Wok's Up expires 
this year, and campus planners are 
courting other quick-service 
Asian-food vendors such as Pick 
Up Stix and Panda Express, 
Ratcliff said.

effective ways of showing support 
than gauging student opinion on 
such a diverse campus." 

Vasquez and the Freedom 
Allianc.e maintained that the reso-
lution did in fact represent the 
views of the majority of the stu-
dents. 

"We thank the senators for 
their support, as the values the 
UCSD Freedom Alliance/Pro-
America Coalition stands for are 
mainstream, and are supported by 
the majority of the campus," 
Vasquez said. "It has become 
apparent to the supporters of the 
resolution, as well as those we 
have discussed this marter outside 
campus, that"the actions taken by 
the A.S. leadership do not need 
reprimand; rather, that they be 
recognized as an injustice to our 
freedom and those who embody 
it, at the expense of personal opin-
ions of student representatives." 

Kyle R. Biebesheimer, the A.S. 
commissioner of student advoca-
cy, said he sees the controversy 
surrounding the resolution as 
indicative of a larger problem. 

"It is not my place to criticize 
my colleagues on the council and 
their own personal views regard-
ing the Bush administration's 
response to the tragedies of Sept. 
11," Biebesheimer said. "I fully 
respect the positions of each of 
our members. But honestly, when 
the A.S. Council is composed of 
so many liberals, one has to won-
der whether conservativ.es have 
any say on this campus, even on 
issues that Democrats and 
Republicans stand united on in 
Washington." 

Dodge said he feels the resolu-

tion presented a question about 
the role of the A.S. Council. 

"This resolution sparked 
healthy conversations and debate 
about the extent of which the 
[A.S. Council) should take stances 
on national issues and for the first 
time in my A.S. career, challenged 
my political views on America 's 
current situation with those of 
smdents who felt different than 
myself," he said. 

'It has become appar-
ent to the supporters 
of the resolution that 
the actions taken by 

the A.S. leadership do 
not need reprimand; 
rather, that they be 

recognized as an 
injustice to our free-
dom and those who 

embody it. at the 
expense of personal 
opinions of student 

representatives.'

Freedom Alliance Spokesman 

Dodge acknowledged his own 
political views on the topic, but 
expressed that he supported the 
amendment and passing of the 
resolution in order to best repre-
sent all students. He said he feels 
the political mobilization that 
went into the resolution is a posi-
tive change on campus. 

"From the beginning, this new 
conservative front via the 
Freedom Alliance finally brings a 
chance for this university and 
especially the students to actively 

NEWS 7 

engage themselves politica lly," 
Dodge said. "Imyselffelt inclined 
to veto the legislation if una-
mended and passed by the A.S. 
Counci l - something that was in 
no way even going to happen with 
the previous legislation - but felt 
it was important to represent all 
students ' views in the A.S. 
Council." 

Brown agreed. 
"I am ext~emely impressed by 

the bipartisan work which went 
into this resolution and remain 
confident in my position that 
the A.S . Council passed a reso-
lution that the most number of 
students possible agree with ," 
Brown said. 

The Freedom Alliance has 
staged many efforts to support 
the national government' action 
in response to the Sept. 11 terror-
ist artacks, and to promote the 
"Pro-American" sentiment, 
including a "Pro-America Rally" 
last quarter. 

Vasquez said he feels that the 
student government's failure to 
pass the original resolution is 
indicative of a larger problem. 

"What disturbs us most is that 
if our A.S. leaders feel no obliga-
tion, no interest in supporting 
unity and freedom in the 
American flag, and our call to 
Chancellor [Roben C.I Dynes, 
and Vice Chancellors Uosephl 
Watson and Damesl Langely to 
support the flag were unanswered, 
the question remains: Who ,,~ II 
support freedom on campus?" 
Vasquez stated . "All of us support 
diversity, respect and tolerance; 
what about uni ty, democracy, and 
liberty, the bedrock of our nation, 
and our way of life ~"

By ALISON NORRIS 
Senior Staff Writer 

Visiting Copley Symphony Hall to see the San Diego Symphony probably does not sound like an 
activity th at most college students 
would include as a "must do" on their 
list of ew Year's resolutions. 
However, if the symphony's "2001 
Extravaganza" show was any indica-
tion of the intri gue, pl easure and 
relaxation that the symphony can pro-
duce, then pinching pennies for a 
~ight of live music would be a worthy 
II1vesrment . 

Conducted by the widely praised 
Jung-Ho Pak, "200 1 Extravaganza" 
consisted of five pieces, four of which 
were made famous by director Stanley 
Kubrick's classic film "2001 : A Space 
Odyssey." 

The performance, crue to the film's 
soundtrack, included a variety of gen-
res and composers ranging from 
Johann Strauss, Jr.'s well-known waltz 
"On the Beautiful Blue Danube" to 
Gyorgy Ligeti's grour1dbreaking 
"Atmospheres," which contains no tra-
ditional elements, such as harmony and 
rhythm. 

The first piece performed, 
"Fanfare from 2001 " by Alex North, 
was written explicitly for Kubrick's 
landmark movie but ironically never 
made it into "A Space Odyssey;" 
Kubrick felt it did not truly mesh with 
the film. Kubrick was right - the 
piece's chiming climax was bearable, 
soft and almost pleasant - and 
Strauss' "On the Beautiful Blue 
Danube" had already satisfied the 
filmwatcher's musical sweet tooth . 
Including another overly enchanting 
song such as "Fanfare" would have 
overdone the contrast that "A Space 
Odyssey" creates between disturbing 
visuals and pleasant sound tracks. 

The closing piece, Richard 
Strauss' "Also Sprach Zarathustra," is 
the source of the notorious five notes 
that accompany the film's opening 

. scene, which have been included in 
every parody of a "space" film since 
"A Space Odyssey." Moviewatchers 
witness but a fraction of the song, 
however, which continues for almost 
30 minutes after the five famous notes 
are played. 

Surprisingly, the piece was actual-
ly composed as a symphonic poem 
that was intended to narrate the the-
ories of German philosopher 
Friedrich Nietzche. Irs bellowing use 
of trumpets sharply contrasts its 
quiet, long descent into si lence - a 
contrast intended to symbolize the 
triumph of man and the eventua l 
mystery of his fate . Strauss' waltz. 
could not have matched the movie 
more perfectly; its presence on the 
film's soundtrack pushes one to admit 
to Kubrick's brilliance. 

Perhaps even more brilliant were 
the San Diego Symphony's perfectly 
honed rendition of this "space" parody 
classic and the deci ion to honor 
Kubrick by performing this well -cho-
en collection of mu ic. 

TH£ UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY,JANUARY 10,2002 

The acts that come to UCSD to perform are usually under a lot of scrutiny. Every 
Triton music fan, each with his or 
her superior point of view, always 
has strong opinions about one artist 
or another. 

One group is too old and another 
is too obscure. One is too pop while 
the other isn't pop enough. One is 
too rock and the other too rap. 
Whatever the case may be, the per-
formers at UCSD have had to face 
the careful observation of the stu-
dents. 

But having to choke down one-
hit wonders at every other festival 
can be pretty difficult at times. 

UCSD's very own night club, 
Club Ritmo, on the other hand, 
returns this year with a great amount 
of potential. Whether you like him 
or not, DJ Skribble is a big name in 
the dance music world and he has 
been highly visible on MTV's "Total 

Request Live" with Carson Daly. In 
fact, Skribble seems to be MTV's 
resident DJ with appearances on 
"The Grind," "M1V's Spring 
Break" and "Sisqo~ Shakedown." He 
also co-hosted "The Cindy Margolis 
Show." 

His mix albums are packed with 
almost too many hits. "Essential 
Dance 2000" features songs by 
Cher, Moby, Fragma and Zombie 
Nation. "Essential Spring Break 
2001" features even bigger acts such 
as M&S presents the Girl Nen 
Door, Spiller, Jakatta, Delerium and 
Darude. 

But even Skribble admits that 
anthem-filled albums such as 
"Essential Dance 2000" were ·do-
what-you-gotta-do, commercial-
introduction things." 

However, Skribble's roots are in 
hip-hop. Long before MTV and 
the hit albums, he toured with hip-
hop great Public Enemy and 

opened for Biggie Smalls and Sean 
UP. Diddy" Combs before they were 
famous. 

It was only by the mid- l990s that 
DJ Skribble started listening to more 
house and began fusing some hip-
hop with house sounds. The result is 
DJ Slcribble's current sound of house 
and trance with some hip-hop 
thrown in the mix. 

Club Ritrno has landed a big-
name DJ who is still fresh enough 
to be remembered and carries 
enough popular hits to make every-
one happy. Yes, DJ Skribble is "that 
guy on MTv," but you have to 
admit that this is one of the 
strongest acts UCSD has had in a 
while. 

So stop thinking about it so much 
and dance.

'Our Sinatra' is a fitting tribute to 01' Blue Eyes 
The trio of New Yorkers and their 12-piece big.band wi" perform all the classic tunes 
By IOSEPH LEE 
Hiatus Editor 

Chances are that most of the students here have not seen Sinatra perform live. 
Hell, some might not even know 
who Frank Sinatra is (1 won't 
explain - you can find Out for 
yourself). But for those who 
know and love the beauty of 
Sinatra and the songs he sang, 
there is a cause for rejoicing as 
the critically acclaimed "Our 
Sinatra" act from New York 
comes to UCSD's Mandeville 
Auditorium. 

T he extremely talented trio 
of Ronny Whyte, Chri topher 

Gines and Sara Weaver are 
backed by a 12 -piece big band 
orchestra that supplies the gor-
geous strings and jazz. tunes 
that made Sinatra one of the 
most famo us vocalists of all 
time. 

"Our Sinatra" is not a cheesy 
tribute act that capitalizes on 
mafia jokes and the Rat Pack. The 
performance is genuine an d full 
ofhearr, with the full intention of 
paying the ultimate tribute to 
Sinatra by singing the songs he 
made classic . 

In this I DO-minute perfor-
mance (complete with intermis-
ion), "Our Sinatra" wiJI feature 

over 50 cia ic songs that were 

performed by the late Sinatra . 
You can expect to, hear classics 
'such as "Strangers in the Night," 

. "Summer Wind," "LucIe, Be a 
Lady," "The Way You Look 
Tonight" and "My Way." Therf! 
are sure to be other crowd 
favorites. 

Whyte is not only a talented 
vocalist but be is recognized as an 
incredible jazz pianist and an 
inductee into the Cabaret Jazz 
Hall of Fame. Gines studied at 
the prestigious Julliard School of 
Music and has performed with 
many famous jazz orchestras at 
famous venues in New York . 
Whyte and Gines worked togeth-
er to create a fitting tribue for 01' 

Blue Eyes. Weaver is an accom-
plished vocalist who has been the 
lead vocalist in one of New York's 
most prestigious orchestras as 
well as lead roles in "West Side 
Story" and " Evita. " 

"Our Sinatra" has sold out 
posh clubs in New York and 
opened to impressive reviews off-
. Broadway with some venues com-
manding at least $50 per ticket; 
SI5 for every student isn't a bad 
deal to watch a new act faithfully 
performing the classics .

Heading for coffee on Hill 
Street in Oceanside 
The Hill Street Coffee House features organic foods 
and hot coffee in a restored Victorian style house 
By RINALDO DORMAN 
Staff Writer 

With a quick trip north, you can find your way to the Hill Street Coffee House. Situated in the Weitzel 
house, built in 1888, this restored Victorian 
style house and garden holds a jewel of the 
coffee-goer's experience. 

Tucked away, the Hill Street is a quiet 
and picturesque place to break from the day 
or to get it started. The manicured garden 
is inviting and soothing, matching the sim-
ple elegance of the interior. . 

In addition to being an organic restau-
rant, using organic produce and coffee, it is 
are also certifiably green: The cafe recycles 
all glass, plastic and paper. Also, it composts 
grounds and food waste and is Styrofoam-
free. 

Hill Street boasts a lengthy and diverse 
menu, so you are sure to find something to 
fit your tastes, no matter what you're in 
the mood for. 

The breakfast menu offers egg dishes, 
burritos, frinaras, sandwiches, along with 
bagels and many other delights. 

The rest of the menu includes more 
sandwiches, salads, pastas and soup. 
Everything is well-prepared, looking as 
good as it tastes. 

Since this is a coffee house, its selection 
of drinks offers hot or blended refreshment; 
it has espresso and coffee concoctions to 
delight your classic and more modern 
expectations. Service is fast and friendly, 
and the atmosphere is casual and welcom-
ing. 

Restaurant 
REVIEW 

Prices are very reasonable, with few 
items costing more then $6, and the most 
expensive being a $7.95 order of Blackened 
Chicken Pesto. Many items have a health-
conscious approach: Vegan Burrito ($5.50), 
Fruit Platter ($3.50), Dr. Naked (raw veg-
etables, $3.95). Though not everything is 
Granola ($3.50); you can get the Clogger 
(three scrambled eggs served on a croissant 
with either grilled ham or turkey and melt-
ed cheese, $4.75), or even a Sloppy Joe 
($5.75). 

Well worth the trip, the Hill Street 
makes for a great escape with some won-
derful food and coffee. A rare example of 
the American coffee house that places more 
emphasis on quality and enjoyment rather 
than on marketability. 

The soothing ~mbiance will undoubted-
ly entice you back again and again, and the 
charm and warmth will have you feeling at 
home in no time.

Bland script brings down an 
empty 'Orange County' 
Jack Black and newcomer Colin Hanks cannot redeem 
a movie that falls apart in almost every respect 
By 10SH CROUSE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Some movies are absolutely worth pay-ing the outrageous price that movie tickets go for, but others, such as Jake 
Kasdan's new film "Orange County," ar~ 
better left for laty afternoons of boredom 
and free cable. A fairly decent idea for a 
movie is ruined by a horrible script and bad 
direction. The film also lacks a solid perfor-
mance from its lead and could not be saved 
by an adequate supporting cast en route to 
movie hell as a horrible picture. 

The movie follows Shawn Brumder 
(Colin Hanks) on his mission to get into 
Stanford University. Shawn is an ex-surfer 
who reformed his slacker ways when he 
found a book in the sand wrinen by Marcus 
Skinner (Kevin Kline), a professor at 
Stanford. The book inspired Shawn to get his 
act together and apply himsdf academically 
so that he could get into Stanford and work 
with his newfound idol. A mix-up causes 
Shawn to get rejected from the school, 
prompting a two-day quest to right the 
wrong and gain admittance. Helping him on 
his quest are his animal rights activist girl-
friend Ashley (Schuyler Fisk) and his perpet-
ually stoned brother Lance (Jack Black). 

While there was absolutely no hope for 
this to be a good movie, the concept itself 
isn't bad. The writing and direction did this 
movie in . The script is an awful piece of 
garbage thar plays out more like a sitcom 
than an actual movie. Mike White, the 
writer of ~Orange County," has also written 
for television's "Freaks & Geeks," which 
would explain why the movie played out 
like a stretched episode of Fox's latest 
attempt at a comedy series. The direction 
was completely disappointing because 
Kasdan failed to utilize the surroundings to 
maximize his shots. 

Hanks had moments during the film -
though they were few and far between -
when he was actually decent on screen. 
Most of the time he was as whiny as a 12-

Film 
REVIEW 

year-old school girl with a skinned knee. He 
simply was not believable, which did not 
bode well for him because the dialogue that 
he was delivering wasn't that great in the 
first place. 

Black did all that he could with what he 
was given. He was absolutely hilarious at 
times as a walking drugstore with a collec-
tion that would make Hunter S. Thompson 
proud. The only knock on his rol e would be 
that it is one that he has played several times . 
before. Black once again plays the high-
octane sidekick inserted for comic relief, as 
he did in both "High Fidelity" and "Saving 
Silverman." While he does a great job in 
the role, the characters are all very one-
dimensional and good only for comedic 
value. 

The movie also features big-name actors 
and actresses in smaller parts. Catherine 
O'Hara and John Lithgow play Hanks' par-
ents while Lily Tomlin, Chevy Chase, 
Garry Marshall, Harold Ramis and Kline all 
make appearances. Unfortunately, not even 
these veterans can save this movie. 

Even the so-called standby physical gags 
that recent movies have used so often did 
not elici t a favorable response from the 
audience. 

The few laughs that the movie does 
deliver fall miserably short of malcing up for 
the overall waste of the hour-and-a-half 
that the film is.

'Fast and Furious' DVD 
speeds into high gear 
The high-speed adventure also features a 
behind-the-scene look at all the stunts 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Staff Writer 

Universal Studios markets "The Fast and the Furious" as a high-speed thriller, and 
indeed the DVD delivers what it 
promises - along with plenty of 
bad aeting and a wandering plot. 

The film features Paul Walker 
as Brian Spindler, an undercover 
dectective exploring the world of 
street racing to solve a string of 
mysterious thefts. However, as he is 
pulled deeper into the street racing 
underworld by racer Dominic 
Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his allur-
ing sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), 
Spindler finds it harder to keep his 
priorities straight. The film also 
stars Michelle Rodriguez as 
Toreno's girlfriend and features a 
cameo appearance by Ja Rule. 

While the plot seems to get lost 
in the film's focus on action, the 
incredible cars and stunts in the 
film are amazing enough for the 
film to get away with it. 

The movie does a good job of 
exposing the culture of illegal rac-
ing, yet does not get in-depth 
enough after providing a tantaliz-
ing glimpse, leaving the viewer 
wanting more . 

Diesel gives one of the few com-
mendable performances, while Ja 
Rule shows that his talent is in the 
musical sphere, not the dramatic 
one. 

The bonus material on the 
DVD includes an amazing selec-
tion of eight different views of the 

DVD 
REVIEW 

final car chase scene, including 
several shots from inside the cars. 
The viewer is also taken behind 
the scenes and exposed to some of 
the tricks director Rob Cohen 
used for several of the stunts in the 
movie. 

Fa.ns can also watch the movie 
with Cohen's commentary, 
although his monotone voice and 
paltry attempts at humor make this 
feature a bit tedious. 

The extra material also includes 
the making of the video and "Racer 
X," the article from which the con-
cept of the movie came. 

Other than the eight camera 
angles of the final scene, the extras 
on the DVD are not particularly 
appealing; there are music videos 
from Ja Rule, Caddillac Taj and 
Saliva, as well as a few deleted 
scenes. But the stunts and high-
tech cars in the movie itself are the 
most interesting aspects. 

In the end, both car enthusiasts 
and action fans will be fully satis-
fied with the incredible cus-
tomized vehicles and fabulous 
stunt driving, but those looking 
for a plot with depth had best look 
elsewhere. The DVD hardly con-
tains bonus material compelling 
enough to win over viewers who 
were not satisfied with the movie 
in the first place.

Paul Vin Dyk 
Politics of Dancing 
Ministry of Sound 

***** 
Paul Van Dyk is simply 

amazing. He is one of the 
greatest producerlDJs the 
electronic music world has 
ever seen. The Van Dyk 
sound transcends your 
basic four-four beats; he 
produces pounding 
basslines and gorgeous 
atmospherics. His produc-
tions are flawless and his 

mixing is fantastic. Those 
lucky enough to have seen 
him know of his powers, 
and those who download 
his live sets wish they could 
have been there. 

Van Dyk once stated 
that he would never do a 
mix CD. His previous 
releases such as "Out ' 
There & Back" and "Seven 
Ways" have been his own 
work mixed together. But 
"Politics of Dancing" is his 
first mixed CD of other 
artists. 

This two-disc set is not 
a collection of the year's 
greatest hits that can be 
found on Ministry of 
Sound's typical releases. 
"Politics of Dancing" is a 
collection of Van Dyk 
favorites that capture the 
mood of a club or a massive.

Meet

Close encounters: David Duchovny, Orlando Jones and Seann William Scan 
team up to defeat alien invaders in the comedy "Evolution: now on DVD.

Evolution: 
DVD provides vivid images of 
aliens and their excre~ons 
Continued from page 11 
by Reichman and the lead actors 
(minus Moore) also drifts into 
over-analysis but is partially saved 
by the surprisingly wry humor of 
David "Mulder" Duchovny, slap-
stick of Orlando "7-Up" Jones and 
Seann William "Stifler" Scott. 

Fortunately, the remaining spe-
cial feature, the deleted scenes, 

Dance: 
Paul Van Dyk's first mix 
album is carefully crafted 
Continued from page 11 

Van Dyk~ own production - he 
added his own production to many 
of the tracks so they would fit the 
context of the music surrounding it. 

Disc one offers an energetic 
but cool groove. In the well-
thought-out liner notes, Van Dyk 
explains that this disc is one he 
would play if he were opening for 
another DJ. He continues to state 
that disc two is what he would 
play if he were headlining. Disc 
two offers more intense sounds 
that are worthy of any party. 

The socially conscious Van Dyk 
also explains why this album is 
titled "Politics of Dancing." He 
reminds everyone that the dance 
music culture was also a political 
culture, a movement that affected 
society as a whole and a movement 
he thinks has fallen by the wayside. 

On "Politics of Dancing," Van 
Dyk offers a reminder of why we 
support dance music and helps us 
focus on the importance of the pol-
itics that surround the dance music 
culture . 

Judas:

'Demolition' is a more of 
disappointment 
Continued from page 11 
suntly plagued by the fact that 
judas Priest seems unable to figure 
out how to make a transition into 
new musical waters. They try be 
what they were while still doing 
something new. The result is lack-
luster and it feels like the band has 
begun to reach the limits of the 
direction that brought it here. 

lt~ doubtful that many people 
will enjoy this album - only die-
hud fans should bother giving this 
a listen.

somewhat makes up for the others 
by being almost more fun-oriented 
than the movie itself. Particularly 
entertaining is an alternate, deleted 
ending that cannot be described in 
words (at least not in a major cam-
pus newspaper). 

Another plus for the DVD is its 
excellent color fidelity; all the dis-
gusting aliens and their excretions 
and protrusions can be scene in 
luminescent detail. 

Finally, to its credit, the DVD 
offers an ample variety of subtitles 
and dub-overs in English, French 
and Spanish.

Super sophomore: UCSD's Ali Ginn leads the young 
Tritons In SCOring. 

Swimming: 

ByANU KUMAR 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's basketball team is 
off to a 6-5 start this season, and the Tritons 
have enjoyed guard Ali Ginn's stellar play 
throughout the first II games. A young 
player on a team full of inexperience, sopho-
more Ginn has proven to be a strong and 
talented force on the court. 

Ginn is among the team leaders for the 
Tritons in several statistic31 categories. She 
averages a team-best J3.1 points per game, 
and has been the leading scorer five of 
UCSD's II games. 

A sophomore from Carlsbad, Calif., 
Ginn plays ~n aggressive style of basket-
ball, which is evident from her frequent 
visits to tlle free -throw line. She has 
attempted 44 shots from the charity stripe, 
converting an impressive 84.1 percent of 
them. 

In addition to her great shooting abili ty, 
the 5' 9" guard looks to crash tlle boards, 
too - she has brought down 4.1 rebounds 
per game for the Tritons. 

In the recent UC San Diego Doubletree 
Invitational played at the RIMAC Arena on 
Dec. 28 and Dec. 29, Ginn led her team t 
twO victories and was named Tourn:lment 
MVP. Tn the Tritons' econd game against 
Central Washington, Ginn took control of 
the game, scoring a season-high 27 points 

Stoner: 

and grabbing 11 rcbounds in a 67-61 over-
time win. 

"Ali played really well in the tourna-
ment," UCSD head coachJudy Malone said 
of her starting guard. "She can just about 
take over a game at any time." 

With two seniors and one junior on the 
women's basketball team, Ginn feels no 
pressure to become a team leader and carry 
the Tritons. 

"I'm nor really a captain-type person 
now," Ginn said. " I just play hard all the 
time and try to lead by example." 

As a communications major, Ginn says of 
her time off the court, "I'm just going trying 
to get through my communications classes." 

After graduating in a li ttle more than two 
years from now, she hopes to find a career 
working in the secret service. 

The Tritons currently h,lVe a three-gamc 
losing streak, but UCSD still has a long sea-
son ahead. Although Ginn leads the team in 
several categories, the team is well-balanced 
and looking to its cohesiveness to get the 
Tri tons back on track this cason. 

Ginn is aggressive and has a strong 
one-on-one game. Her talent especially 
helps the Tritons down the stretch in close 
games, just as she did in UCSD's game 
against Central Washington. T he sopho-
more 's responsibilities may change as she 
gains experience, but this current tC.lIll 
just looks for her strong play on the court.

A 
the 

lot of coaches 
love to espouse 

notion that 
sports are like life, 
and if you have the 
dedication, character 
and intelligence to 
succeed in one, then 
you can succeed in 
the other. 

Well just like in real life, sports 
have the good, the bad and the 
ugly. And since I'm a sports editor 
and not a life editor, I fortunately 
get to comment on the good, bad 
and ugly for sportS - not life. 

The following are just a few of 
the gems that have occurred in the 
porting world in the past year; 

some headlines from Sports 
Illustrated's end-of-the-year issue. 

For the econd year in a row, the 
Bowl Championship Ser-ies college 
foo tball computer ranking system 
sent a disputed team to the nation-
al championship Rose Bowl by 
picking ebraska, who was embar-
rassed by Colorado during the reg-
ular season and then was em bar-
ra sed again by Miami . When are 
the college officials going to realize 
that the BCS just doesn't work? 
Al aybe next year they can use my 
shi tty iMac, and we'll see UCSD 
come up for the 2003 Rose Bowl. 

A heads-up for all the whiny mul-
timillionaire athletes in the United 
States: Here is just one of the differ-
ences between sports in America and 
sports in the rest of the world -
here, the average salary for a desig-
nated hitter is $5,650,019, whereas 
in Turkey, a soccer club traded four 
players to its rival team for 22 5 sacks 
of cement. I guess they're in a 
rebuilding phase. 

The Stanford rugby team forfeit-
ed a match against Cal because 
according to Stanford coach Franck 
Bolvert, his players were "afraid to 
get injured, and indeed, fear for their 
safety." Hmrn, do you think a forfeit 
is a fair trade for your manhood? 

Former Dallas Cowboy Nate 
Newton was caught on Nov. 4 with 
213 pounds of marijuana in his van. 
Six weeks later he was caught again, 
this time with only 175 pounds of 
marijuana . I guess the harsh 
enforcement of the law toward rich 
law-breaking athletes really worked. 

Padres pi tcher Adam Eaton was 
forced to go on the disabled list and 
miss a start after giving himself an 
inch-deep cut in his stomach while 
trying to open a new DVD. Yeah, 
Eaton, watching digital quality film 
from the emergency room just isn't 
quite the same, is it? 

Two University of Kansas 
J ayhawk football players stole a stu-
dent's purse and used her credit 
card to order pizza. She called the 
police, who tracked the card and 
apprehended the player-s. Showing 
those world-famous football 
smarts, they pleaded not guilty.

Tritons seOeking improvement 
Men's volleyball looking to rebound this year 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

After a tough inaugural season 
last year in the Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation, UCSD's men's 
volleyball team is seeking to return 
to its winning ways, which gar-
nered a Division III national 
championship in 2000. 

In its first year of competition 
in the league, which is composed 
of both Division I and II pro-
grams, UCSD finished dead last 
with a 6-21 overall record and a 0-
17 conference record . 

Head coach Ron Larsen, 
beginning his third year with the 
Tritons, equivocated when asked 
about his team's chances in 
2002. 

"That's always a tough question 
for us because we play in such a 
tough league," he said. "I really 
like where we are right now. We 
have people who have stepped into 
a couple of key positions from 
seniors graduating." 

Graduation last year saw 
UCSD lose two of its best players, 
Donald Chen and Zack Hite. 

Chen was the team leader in 
kills , finishing the season with 
376; over 100 ITIOre than the 
nearest Triton . He also led the 
team in minutes, sitting out only 
one set of the total 95 UCSD 
played last year. He was also 
among the team leaders of the 
Tritons defensively, posting 148 
digs on the season. 

Hite was also a huge part of 
the Tritons last year, finishing 
second to Chen in kills and min-
utes, and was fourth on the team 
in digs. 

"They are two losses we have," 
Larsen said. "We are going to lose 
Zack's leadership ability and his 
four years of experience." 

However, Larsen is optimistic 

about the players filling the gap 
created by the graduated seniors. 

"We think we have a few peo-
ple to step in," he aid. "Jim 
Waller, who we think is going to 
step in and play well in Chen's 
position as an opposite, and Joe 
Griffin is a high-flying outside 
hitter who jumps over 40 inches 
and we think he'll be good 
there. " 

Griffin and Waller, both 
sophomores, saw limited action 
for UCSD last year but now will 
have to step up for the Tritons, as 
they are seeking contributions 
from their returnees rather than 
their freshmen. 

"I'm looking at our freshmen 
and I'm not sure if they're going 
to give a great contribution this 
yea r," Larsen said . "[We are 
looking for contributions from) 
more redshirts than last year." 

The Tritons are seeking a lot of 
production from their top two 
returners, senior setter Jordan 
Hove and junior Eric Perrine. 

"Eric and Jordan are our cap-
tains and are expected to lead the 
team," Larsen said.' 

Larsen also mentioned junior 
outside hitter Chris Mortimer as 
another key to this year's squad. 

However, like last year, UC D 
will be deficient in the one area 
which no amount of practice 
helps: height. 

"I think height [is our biggest 
weakness)," Larsen said. "We're 
not really big and it's clearly one of 
our biggest differences. We're not 
able to compete at the net. It 
would help if we were a bit big-
ger." 

But the Tritons do have their 
share of strengths as well. 

"We're servicing the ball real-
ly well and we're playing fabu-
lous defense," Larsen said. " If we 
can just bring up our offense,

we' ll be better than last year." 

The men's volleyball team 
gets its first test Saturday as they 
travel north to take on a noncon-
ference opponent, California 
Baptist University at I p.m. at 
Riverside . 

The Tritons then begin 

league play on Jan . 18, when 
they host the U niversi ty of 
Southern California. 

Overall, Larsen is satisfied with 
his team's progress. 

"I think we have a competitive 
team and they work really hard," 
he said. 

Women's swimming drops meet against UCLA

After a month without compe-
tition, the UCSD women 's swi m-
ming team fell to Division I power 
UCLA 179-83 Jan. 3 at 
Canyonview pool. 

While the women's soccer and 
volleyball teams were grabbing all 

were undergoing grueling practices 
in preparation for the winter season. 

"This meet was good for us 
because we were at the end of our 
winter training," said Triton coach 
Scott McGihon. "It allowed us to 
get back in the pool and see where 
we stand against much faster com-

petition." 
The Tritons now have a 4-2 

record in dual meets and finished an 
impressive sixth place (out of 16) in 
Decembers Speedo Cup, a compe-
tition laden with Division I schools. 

Before the meet with UCLA, 
both coaches decided to shorten the 
length of most individual races - a 
move made due to both squads' 
intense winter conditioning. 

"We didn't have a month off," 
said senior Lindsay Meeks. "We 
had a month of hard work." 

As expected, both teams had 
slow times, bur the Tritons managed 

. to get in a couple of solid results. 
Meeks, who pulled down sixth-

and seventh-place finishes in the 
200- and 100-yard breaststroke, 
respectively, during the 2001 
National Collegiate Athletic 
Association Championships, won 
the first race of the day for . the 
Tritons when she led a UCSD 1-2-
3 sweep of the 50-yard breaststroke 
with a time of 30.40 seconds. 

Later, junior Samantha Wong, 
anchor of the 2001 Division II 

champion 400-yard medley team, 
led another Triton sweep of the 100-
yard freestyle with 54.22 seconds. 

"In the end, I was pleasa ntly 
surprised wi th our resul ts," 
McGihon admitted. "We raced 
much faster than I thought we 
would and were just touched out 
in a couple of races." 

Both the men's and women's 
diving teams were' also in action in 
the last week of winter break, com-
peting in the UC Irvine Diving 
Invitational over the weekend . 
The Tritons were a last-minute 
entry into the largely Division I 
field but fared well . 

Elizabeth Sales had the best out-
ing for the Tritons, finishing ninth 
out of 23 in the one-meter diving 
competition with a score of 396.95. 

She was the only UCSD diver 
in the. top 12 after the first six 
optional dives. With only the top. 
12 left, the divers in the competi-
tion had to complete five more 
required dives. In the three-meter
