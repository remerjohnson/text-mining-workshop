AS Vote 
Censures 
Guardian's 
"Sexism" 

By Risa Lee Podolsky 
The AS Council vot d 

overwhelming last night to 
recommend the Daily 
Guardian turn over revenues 
from a "sexist" ad to the 
Women's Center. 

Jim Lofgren, former A 
official, explained that he 
wanted to stir up feeling on 
campus. He called the ad 
"blatant sexism" and said he 
was "shoc ked that more 
women didn't realize this. " 

The vote concerned a n 
insert for Dos Equis beer 
showing two women posing' 
" haunch to haunch" which, 
Guardian editors acknow-
ledged Monday, was "sexism 
in the most vulgar sense of the 
term." 

The ad, which appeared 
twice last week, was followed 
three days ago by an editorial 
apologizing for the ad and the 
paper's "negligence." 

The editorial explained that 
editorial board members did 
not review the ad before a 
contract was made with Dos 
Equis and would not have run 
the ad if it had been reviewed. 
Such ads will not appear in the 
paper again, the editorial 
added. 

"It was tactless. If this was a 
black boy sitting there eating 
watermelon, people would be 
going nuts," Linda Sabo, 
commissioner of extern;.1 
atlairs, said. "This is no 
different. A lot of men put the 
posters on their walls. We 
don't think that's wall 
decoration," she said. 

The AS hopes the Women's 
Center would use the money, 
approximately $250, to 
"support the fight against 
sexism." Several council 
members suggested the Center 
use the money to invite a 
speaker to UCSD to talk about 
sexism. 

Cheryl [)tmnet. a Women's 
Center member, said after the 
meeting that she supported the 
resolution, calling the money 
"a show of good faith." She 
said the money would be used 
to " help develop the 
awareness" of sexism." 

Lofgren stressed that "11m 
not upset at the Guardian, I'm 
upset about sexism." 

Sabo agreed and said, "We 
didn't threaten the Guardian in 
any way." 

Eric Jaye, Guardian editor, 
said, "The AS has every right 
to Issue these sorts of 
advisories, but it's important to 
note they have no formal 
authority over us." 

"In our editorial, we 
explained why the ad ran. Thi 
sort of thinl.( won't happen 
again," he said. 

"We can't be made 
respon ible for all the !lexi m in 
the world. Where was the AS

UCSD Joins PrograDl to Aid 
State's Indochinese Refugees 

21 Students Will Work on ACTION 
By Caitlin Horowitz 

A pioneer program in California rising to the 
need of Indochinese refugees will employ 21 
UCSD students for up to a year. 

Called the University Year for ACTION and 
f6rtified by $360,000 in federal funds. the 
project will provide services in language 
training. consumer/legal counseling, home 
management, resettlement ; health and 
economic planning, citizenship preparation and 
community development. 

An addendum to the program. which 
includes UCLA and Irvine, is an extensive plan 
for research, according to Warren Acting Dean 
Julie Gordon. Gordon says the research will 
determine "the most ellective and human ways 
to help Indochinese people adjust to Western' 
culture. 

"The internship program is designed to aid 
those refugees settling in San Diego who don't 
have the skills they need to survive. It will be a 
vital service," Gordon added. 

But assimilation of a foreign people into a 
new culture is not accomplished in a few days, 
Gordon continued. and students who volunteer 
will be making a serious committment. 

"Interns will be committing themselves for a 
year, and maybe even longer. They will. of 
course receive compensation - four units per 
quarter as well as a monthly stipend of $324 -
but it (the project) will require some sacrifice." 

However members of the academic 
community see definite a~vantages to students. 

In fact, Gordon claims, many educators 
have rallied in support. Says Associate 
Professor of Political Science. Samuel Popkin. 
"Students Will be able to take advantage 
academi"ally of the time they spend in service 
of the program. For instance. the~ might 
complete 198 or 199 requirements (courses 
allowing for independent study) while working 
for the project." 

Gordon dillmillses rumors that the refuge II 
could bring health problems with them from 
Indochina. 

Specific screening policiell. she says. are 
beinJ,( firmly enforced. 

Studt'nts will be examined for TB before 
entering the program. at certain times within the 
year. and then aJ,(ain at the end. But I'd really 
like to strt'ss how remote the polisibility ill."

AFSCME 
Gets Blue 
Collar 
Support 

By John Hondrol 
Alsociate News Editor 
UC blue collar workers may 

eventually be represented by 
the American Federation of 
State, County and Municipal 
Employees. as it yesterday 
became the first union to file 
the required petition. 

Over 30 percent of the 
unionized blue collar workers 
employed systemwide signed 
the petition to the Public 
Employee Relations Board 
requesting AFSCME repre-
sentati.on, according to 
AFSCME member Jim 
Stronski. The move calls for a 
systemwide election to decide 
on a bargaining representative 
for UC service workers. he 
says. 

"If we had had 51 percent of 
the blue collar unit signed up, 
we (AFSCME) would have 
been recognized immediately 
as its bargaining agent," says 
Stronski. "Since we didn't, a 
5 t nt jority . he 
needed in the systemwide 
election to validate AFSCME 
as the representative." 

However, Stronski adds, no 
other union has received as 
much support in the UC 
system as AFSCME so far. 

AFSCME member Susan 
Orlofsky believes her union 
will get the majority vote 
needed since it is "the only 
AFL-CIO unit in the UC 
system."

causing f1uhllooding through 
Navajo land. that Itretched 
put the city of Gallup. The 
dam held back waite materials 
produced during the uranium 
milling procell. Since then, 
these troubling facta have 
come to light: 

- State officials never 
inspected the two-year old 
dam, even after reports of 
crackl_ 

- State of6cials did not 
know that only half the 
required safety material was 
_ on conatrudion. 

- No monitoring IYltem 
was in place to warn of spill 
threata. 

- Official agencies have 
been slow to act in the wake of 
the IpiII to protect the health of 
humans ancIlive.tock exposed 
to the radioactive materiall. 

- Before the HashOood 
lpent itself on its path toward 
the Little Colorado River it had 
traveled about 60 miles, 
invaded neighboring Arizona, 
and reach~ within 20 miles of 
Petrified National Park, which 
draws 900,000 visitors a year 
and relies on water drawn from 
a single well within the Hood 
plain. 

How the spill could have 
happened, who was responsi-
ble and how it can be 
prevented from recurring will 
be examined by Rep. Morris 
Udall'. (D-Ariz) Energy and 
Environment Subcommittee of 
the House Interior Committee 

Oct. 22. 
1be hearing was requested 

by Navajo Tribal Chairman 
Peter Mc Donald, who says 
that "this represents a far 
greater threat to the health and 
safety 01 the people in this area 
than did the celebrated 
accident at Three Mile 
Island." 

Dan Cobb, managing editor 
of the daily Gallup 
Independent, adds that at 
Three Mile Island, the worst 
possible - "the China 
Syndrome" - was feared but 
did not happen. 

"But here we've got aelual 
contamination all over the 
damn place and nobody really 
knows what it's going to do 
and how long it's going to 
last," Cobb added. 

"Unless we can mobilize 

public pressure on the 
company and the NRC 
(Nuclear Regulatory Commis-
sion), the prognosis is not 
good," says Dr. Jorg 
Winterer, a public health 
official in Gallup. "New 
Mexico can't clean up its ael 
because, I think, the uranium 
industry owns the state. A lot 
01 people in New Mexico are 
pronuclear because it's a 
bread and butter issue . 
Uranium is. the fastest growing 
industry in the state. It's King • 
Cotton in the South, it's King 
Uranium in the Southwest." 

Cobb says there's enough 
blame to spread around 
everyone for the spill. 

"Perhaps United Nuclear 
has taken too much of t1'Ie 
brunt for this - I'm not saying 
they're not at fault," he 

"When we first called 
them," he added, "they denied 
there were cracks; then they 
said the cracks weren't 
important. But the regulatory 
procedure does not make it 
clear what constitutes a cause 
to report a crack. The state left 
it up in the air, but now they're 
saying it's United Nuclear's 
fault. The agencies are all 
busy trying to shift the blame 
to someone else." 

The cracks were the result 
of improper construelion in the 
first place, according to state 

en~ineer Steve Reynolds. 
"The dam was not construeled 
in accordance with plans and 
specifications," he told Pacific 
News Service. "But we didn't 
discover that until after the 
spill. " 

Reynolds said United 
Nuclear was supposed to 
construct the dam 01 two 
materials: a clay, impermea· 
b1e zone and a sandy rock 
permeable zone. The second 
zone was required so "cracks 
could not extend through the 
dam," he said. The company 
did not use as much of the 
sapdy·rock material as... the 
state required. J.L. White-

Nestle Baby Formula Devastates Third World 
profit no matter where, how, or 
what the consequences, these 
women will continue starving 
their infants to death. 

By Chril Schenone 
In the late 19605, leeding 

babies powdered formula from 
a bottle became highly 
controversial. Because of 
mass adv~rtising campaigns 

Schenone is a UCSD 
student. CALPIRG will pre-
sent the film, "Bottle Babies, " 
a docwnentarll about the use 
of infanl formula in Third 
World countries, on Wednes-
dOli, Ocl. 17 al noon, 2 pm 
and 4 pm. Admission is free. 

by Nestles, Brystol-Myers, 
Wyeth and other large 
companies, bottle feeding 
became more and more 
popular - and more and more 
deadly, especially in Third 
World nations. Convincing 
mothers of these Third World 

countries that bottle feeding is 
easier and healthier lor them 
and their babies than 
breastfeeding is a morbid way 
for these companies to make a 
profit. 

Nestles and other corpora-
tions started mass advertising 
of baby formula in the United 
States ·over 30 years ago. 
Many mothers were con-
vinced powdered lormula 
would give their babies 
nutrients they were incapable 
of providing by breastfeeding 
their infants. 

Nestles also convinced 
women that their breast would 
lose their shape if they 
breastfed their babies, and 
insinuated that by using 
powdered formula , mothers 
need not be tied down to their 
small inlants . But is isn't true 
that women lose the shape 01 

Letter to the Editor 

their breasts after breastleed-
ing, and lor women who really 
love their infants liberation in 
the form of a bottle should not 
be what they are seeking. 

Nestles also persu~ded 
mothers in Third World 
nations to use the infant 
formula and i~fant mortality is 
up. Because of unsanitary 
bottles and contaminated 
water in many underdevel-
oped areas, babies have been 
suffering from diarrhea and 
malnutrition. Malnutrition for 
infants less than one year old 
can cause brain damage and 
death. Many families send up 
spending 25 percent or more 
of their daily income for this 
powdered substance. Not 
knowing what harm can be 
done to their babies, these 
mother dilute the formula to 
make it last longer. Some 

Asian Speaker Left Out of CUDA Story 
Editor: 

It has come to my attention 
that The Dailll Guardian (Oct. 
8) failed to provide the UCSD 
student population with 
adequate coverage of the 
A.ian American Students 

Alliance participation in 
CUDA. Except for the name 
of AASA's guest speaker, 
Philip VeFa Cruz, therewaano 
other mention of AASA 
ip the article. If it was 

an oversight, it sure was a big 
one! 

The number of Asian-
American students enrolled at 
UCSD is increasing annually. 
With the growing numbers, 
the need lor Asian awareness 
increases. CUDA and other 
cultural events provide lor part 
of this need. Vet The Daily 
Guardian fails to inform the 
student body adequately of 
such events and of the role that 
AASA ;>Iii"': in providing 
Asian awareness. 

Why wasn 't Philip Vera 

Cruz quoted from his speech? 
I he ASian students on 
campus will not tolerate being 
left out. The other affirmative 
action organizations also 

sympathiz~ with our 
complaint. When you plan to 
write up a story, whether it 
pertains to cultural activities or 
not, make it complete and 
accurate. Your readers 
demand it and a professional 
paper requires it. 

GLENN DELCARMEN 
AASA Co·ore member 

actually believe it is the bottle 
that nourishes their child. 
They feed their infants water 
when they can't afford the 
formula. 

Realizing it was going 
overboard in plugging of infant 
formula ill. the Third World , 
Nestles halted its consumer 
advertising but found another 
way of reaching the women. 
Nestles started sending free 
samples of their formula to 
hospitals and clinics, and sent 
women in white uniforms 
(some may have been 
qualified nurses, but many 
weren't) to promote the sale of 
their product. These money 
hungry "nurses" explain the 
proper use of Nestles' baby 
formula. So impressive are 
these presentations to mothers 
that they believe like their 
American counterparts, that 
breastfeeding is not the best 
way to nourish their infant. 

Nestles feels it hilS done no 
wrong ·in selling baby formula 
allover the world, even in 
areas where it is unaffordable 
or areas in which it may no be 
mixed with proper water. 
Whether Nestles and other 
corporations are wrong or 
right in selling infant formula, 
they can help these babies by 
halting all sales of their 
product, forcing women to go 
back to breastfeeding. After 
all, infant formula is a poor 
substitute for mother's natural 
milk when used under 
unfavorable conditions. 

However, as long as Nestles 
has only one motive, to seek 

What can we do to end the 
use of infant formula? Boycott 
Nestles and save a few · 
innocent babies.

A,ainat Campus AII.ny Presence 
PEKING ' (AP) - More 

than 2,000 shouting, banner· 
waving students staged a sit·in 
at the gates 01 government 
yesterday to demand that the 
army move out of their 
university campus. 

"Give us back our school!" 
they shouted. "We will not go 
to scftool while the army 
remains! Give us back our 
dormitories and our kitchens!" 

The students, carrying 
huge banners and hand 
pennants , marched up and 
down Pekin g' s main 
boulevard, Changan, circled 
around Tien An Men square, 
the country's largest and 
returned to the ornate red and

headquarters of the Commu-
nist Party and government. 

The People's University 

students, relatively restrained 
and well·organized, insisted 
the Second Artillery force 
move out of university 
facilities. The school was 
closed in 1972 and occupied 
by the sold·iers . It was 
reopened last year and the 
army was to have left by 
August 1978. The soldiers, 
plagued by a shortage of living 
space in capital , are reluctant 
to leave. 

The army has yielded about 
one-third of the c ampus, 
mostly classrooms , but 
remains in the donnitories, 
which the students want to use_ 

There was no offic ia l 
comment or explanation of the' 
occupation. 

It was the largest protest of 
the year at the d()()rstep to the

hundred paupers from the 
provinces had camped off and 
on during the summer, ' 
appealing for improvement in 
their standard of living.

Tritons Stick It Out, But ... 
By Greg Laughlin 

In their first game of the 
season, the fi eld hockey tea m 
a llowed a goal in the final two 
minutes and lost to Grossmont 
College 1-0. 

Two Triton women sat out 
the game with injuries, forcing 
the te&m to play with 10 
women, one short of the 
number of players a llowed on 
th e fi e ld. Des pit e thi s 
ha ndicap, the team remained 
on Grossmont territory during 
more tha n ha lf of the ga me. 

Much of the credi t for 
coordina ting the outma nned 
defense through the first 68 
scoreless minutes went to 
goalie Robin Gelston-Wa lls, 
who shouted instruc tions to 
her teamma tes. 

The loss puts the Tritons at 
0-1 for the season, with six 
games le ft to play. Grossmont 
picked up its second win of this 
year, against six losses. 

The tea m travels next week 
to Long Beach for a ma tch 
with Long Beach S ta te, then

1M Kickoff Spirited 
By Tim Liotta 
Staff Writer 

1M footba ll fina lly go t under way this past weekend a nd the 
action was as fast and furious as anticipa ted . UCSD doesn't 
have and intercollegiate foo tba ll team, so the enthusiasm a nd 
spi rit tha t go into such a program oft en show up in the 1M 
competition. 

Almost every team has a group of followers screaming and 
encouraging their players on. These people witnessed a brand of 
footba ll tha t isn't found a t the intercollegiate or professional 
level. However, there are similia rities . 

With the ba ll res ting on thei r own two yard line, York Hunt 
C lu b qu ickly huddled up. They were pinned deep in the ir own 
territory a fter a brill iant defensive stand . Quarterback Scott 
Berndes, who a lso has a job in the intra mura l office, carefully 
eyed the defense and di agrammed an intrica te play on the palm 
of his ha nd . 

T he " Hunt Club" came to the line of sc rimmage in a Dallas 
Cowboy sho tgun offense_ With the authority of LA Ra m Pat 
Haden, he barked out the signa ls . 

With the snap of the ba ll , his receive rs scatte red in all 
directions. Berndes dropped back into his own end zone as the 
pass rush ca me a t him from a ll angles . Just as the pocket 
surrounding him began to crumble. Ber ndes spotted Carl 
Northcra ft , his former high schoolteammate breaking into the 
cie,,,. Instonlly he let loose a patented wobbler that would've 
made Billy Kilmer jealous . As una ttractive as it looked, the pallS 
was pt:rfect and Northcraft didn 't even have to break stride. 
Northcra t scampered 78 yards for a York touchdown,'lealing 
the club's victory. 

AAA 1M fooiball began with some fierce playas Black Death 
a sserted itself as the team to beat for the Alabama league 
cha mpionship. They rolled over Lrn; Borochos 27-0 though 
unable to score until the last play of the first half. Quarterback 
Anthony Filer directed a balanced offense with precision pasliing 
utilizing every player on the field. 

Polo T earn Makes Splash 
As the wa ter polo team just 

sta rted getting acquainted , 
they won their first tourna ment 
of the year, in four s tra ight 
vic tories at Cla remont College 
last weekend. 

T he Tritons rolled over 
C la remont 16- ll , Santa 
Clara 1 S- ll , Pomona l2-5, 
a nd Loyola 22- II , in the 
round -robin tourney for the 
championship. The win over 
Santa Cla ra was especially 
sati sfying, since the Tritons 
lost to them last year on their 
roa d t ri p to N o rth e rn 
California. 

Dan Eby, Jeff Ell iott , and 
goalie Willie Morris won spots 
on the AII-Tournament team, 
while Dan Cra ne , Toby 

Raymond , Tracy Patrick , and 
T racy Strahl made honorable 
ment'ions. Notably missing 
from the list was hi gh-scoring 
Ka i Loede l, who was fi ghting a 
chest cold tha t weekend. 
Pa trick a nd Strahl, not among 
the starting seven , had the 
o pportunit y to s c or e 
repeatedly in a ga me. Pa trick 
put in five against Loyola , and 
Strahl scored four in that 
game. 

The four wins e levate the 
team's season record to 7-2 . 
But the record is deceiving, for 
the Tritons have been beating 
the little schools - Cla remont , 
Grossmont , Pomona ·Pitzer . 
Whittier .

'Hello, San Diego' 

Van Halen Likes Applause, Gets It 
By Steve Roberts 

Judging by the crowd response. and the lact 
tha t the concert sold out three days after tickets 
went on sale. one would assume that a large 
number of San Diegans a re quite lond of Van 
Halen. For members of that crowd. it wasn 't 
hard to understand why. 

We arrived in time lor Van Ha len, who 
star ted off the lirst set with one 01 their best 
songs, "Light Up The ky" . Immediately. the 
speclators were standing on their chairs. Tne 
screams and applause lasted straight through 
the nex t two songs, and didn't subside until lead 
vocalist David Lee Roth began one of a series 
01 " Hello San Diego" speeches which consisted 
01 lines like" ... I'm gonna te ll ya surnthin. man . 
an its the goddam truth ; San Dieg-o , you 're the 
f uckin greatest!" Alter which. of course, the 
audience went into anot her frenzy which lasled 
lor minutes . 

" ... the spectators were 
standing on their chairs, " 

During the remainder of the concert, many 
such breaks followed. Van Ha len likes 
appla use. 

There was a considerable amount 01 
improvisation in most 01 th songs. and the best 
songs performed were " I Can't Wait to Feel 
Your Love Tonight" , "Ain't Talkin ' 'Bout 
Love" , "Outa Love Again " and "J amie's 
Cryin"'. Rolh's screams and grufly voice were 
excellent. as expected (although when he didn 't 
feel like singi ng. he just didn't sing. but just 
stood there smiling or did a jumping jack or 
shook hands wi th a member 01 the i;ludience.) 
and the back·up vocals were every bit as clean 
as on their a lbums, a nd right on pitch. 

Each member of the band had a solo , but, of 
course. the highligh t was Edward Van Halen's 
gui tar solo . For those of you who don't know,

Van Halen lit up San Diego's skies last weekend. 

Eddie is a master of distortion a nd tone , and has 
some 01 the tastiest and quickest licks in rock

These guys are out to have fun , and they 
make it perfectly clear. For insta nce , during the

Gardner Says Moral Art is 'Life- Giving' 
By Chris Sherman 

uTo understand a complex 
work 01 art, one must be 
something 01 an artist 
oneself." John Gardner, On 
Moral Fiction. 

desire to be close to other 
people are the cause of his 
notorious traits. 

however . From the middle of 
the 18th century the 
conception of the auteur has 
been developing. The cult of 
the individual has stressed 
segregation of people into 
categories which deny 
cooperation and stress 
individuality (almost above 
content). With the stress 
placed on the individual during 
the creative phase, criticism 
can only follow suit. 

"True criticism praises true 
art as plainly and 
comprehensively as possible, 
and denounces false art for its 
failure," Gardner asserts. 
Contemporary critics often 

praise the trivial, celebrating 
futile and non·moral art. The 
greatest problem with modern 
criticism is tha t it is much 
easier to accept as dOg'matic 
doctrine than art itself. If a 
critic adopts a pretentious and 
scholarly tone when writing 
about a piece of art, he' may 
impart a sense of intellectual. , 
ism which does not exist in the 
artwork itself. This may 
mystify the reader and make 
the actual appreciation and 
understanding of the work all 
the more difficult. This type of 
criticism has about as much 
value as the arguments over 
the kind of animals which exist 

in fire, or how many angels 
can fit on the head of a pin, 
says Gardner. 

'Ihe notion of a return to 
morality in art and fiction is 
intuitively appealing', but also 
seems quite naive. Gardner 
makes a convim:ing urg'ument 
for the side of the good g'UYS 
who want to ..... beat back the 
monsters and make the world 
safe for triviality." The ideas 
he expresses are far more 
interesting than his a ' tual 
cri tiqu es of contemporary 
authors like Vonnegut and 
Heller, All in a ll an int eresting 
book by one of the most moral 
authors writing in America , 

As an artist writing 
criticism, novelist John 
Gardner has taken on a vast 
project. On Moral Fiction is 
" ... an analysis of what has 
gone wrong in recent years 
with the various art .... and 
what has gone wrong with 
criticism." Writing in a 
flamboyant style laced with 
simile and metaphor, Gardner 
has given us an interesting and 
entertaining book, but faUs 
somewhat short of developing 
a new definition of art. 

Gardner's own fiction is 
often proiaic and romantic. 
He is a scholar 01 medieval 
times, and steeps his fiction in 
an atmosphere of comfortable, 
fireside myth. Grendel, for 
example, is a retelling 01 the 

The major issue of On 
Moral Fiction, as the title 
suggests, is morality and the 
responsibility placed on artists 
for creating moral works of 
art. "It seems to me," says 
Gardner, "that morality has 
frequently been used as a 
means of oppression, a cover 
... for political tyranny, self-
righteous brutality, hypocrisy, 
and failed imagination." 
Moral art, he insists, is none of 
that. Moral art is "life-giving" 
or "life.affirming." One of the 
major obstacles for the artist 
striving to create moral art has 
been the recent development 
of a "phantom morality." 

Gardner stresses this 
"phantom morality" as if the 
concept were new. The artist is 
considered a freak, an outsider 
who can create a scathing 
portrait of a society, but who 
individually is a weirdo. Not 
only does the artist do weird 
things; he should do weird 
things. And more often than 
not, these weird things are not 
moral.

Rick Danko and Paul Butterfield, two 
veter ans of 60s rock and roll. will be playing at 
the Catamaran Hotel Thursday, Oct. 1 i . 

Danko, as any discriminating I"Ock fan 
knows, was bassist for The! Bond, which to this 
da,y, stands as one of the most consistently 
bnlhant ensembles that rock and roll has ever 
produced . Danko has been noted for his 
abilities as a bass player - alternately rock 
steady and flowing - but few folds really 
have any Idea of how good a singer he is . His 
first Arista record, Ricll Oanlw remedies tha t 
situation. Accompanied on the disc by Eric 
elapton ;, Foug Sahm and Ronnie Wood, 
Danko sings rock and roll. cajun. folk. and 
blues all with equal relish , exhibiting a very 
natural style that's all too rare . 

Paul. Butterfield has been one of the 
constant pivots of rock innovation. A 
harmo,:,ica genius who garnered his chops on

giants Little Walker. Carrie Bell and James 
Collen, the Butterfield Blues Band were 
among the first to venture into the nascent 
areas of jazz.rock, country, and stone 
Chicago blues, and were one of the first bands 
to use horn section, long before later 
ensembles like Blood Sweat and Tears and 
Chicago. Butterfield has performed, on record 
and in person, with John Mayall, Felix 
Papal",rdi, Muddy Waters , and Maria 
Muldaur, and his skills as both harp player 
and smger have, not diminished, Together; 
Danko and Butterfield make a formidable 
rock and roll pair, covering a wide swath of 
styles with a verve and commitment to their 
music tha t sends audiences reeling. 

This one night engagement should be 
attended by anyone who suspects that older 
rock stars have lost their kick. The

that she has had a n affair, 
attends rap sessions with other 
'male divorcees, becomes 
involved off and on 
with unmarried nursery school 
teacher Marilyn Holmberg. In 
plot. the two movies are nearly 
indistinguishable. However, 
while An Unmarried Woman 
takes a sympathetic look at the 
female 's side of the situation, 
StartinR Owr makes the 
male's side a total farce - a 
well done farce.' The serious 
moments have a tendency to 
drag the otherwise perfect 
comedy, but these occur 
infrequently and last just long 
enough for the viewers to 
recompose and prepare 
themselves for the next fit of 
laughter. The excellent timing, 

~nappy dialogue, and 
hilarious lacial expressions are 
made even more 50 by Alan 
Pakula, whose directing in 
Slarling Over will undoubtedly 
attract the same kind of 
attention he received for All 
The President's Men, and 
Marion Rothman, whose 
editing is wonderfully devoid 

of distracting special effects. A 
musical score by Marvin 
Hamlisch, lyrics by Carole 
Bayer Saget, and . songs by 
Alan and Marilyn Bergman 
add their finishinM touches to 
to the movie. 

The cast could have not 
been more compatible. Burt 
Reynolds has finally cast off 
his good old country boy and 
general hell-raiser images in 
favor of a solid and 5ubstantial 
performance as Phil. Jill 
Clayburgh is simply 
marvelous in her role 01 Phil's 
lover. Candice Bergen'. 
"singing" is painful for the 
ears, but delightful to the funny 
bone, as is her character 
Jcssica. Charles Dumm, and 
Frances Sternhagen lend their 
own comedic nuances throullh 
their supporting parts of Phil's 
psychiatrist friend Mickey and 
his matchmaking wife, Marva. 

Presently being shown at 
the Valley Circle lnea ter , 
Starting Owr should be, if it is 
not already, first on the list of 

' most recommended films.

At Wang Laboratories, we make computer and word processing systems. 
But we're really not in the computer or word processing business. 

Our business is productivity. And that's a pe~ple business. 

Because it's people who produce. Machines just make it easier. 
Maybe all this sounds obvious. But you'd be surprised how many com-
puter and word processing manufacturers forget that the end users of 
their products are people. 

At Wang, we never forget. 

That's why our products are simpler to use than theirs. And more 
efficient. 

And that's why we're growing faster than anybody else in the business. 

~ And that's why we're interested in Bachelor's, Master's or 'PhD

Spill Threatens New Mexico Water 
c.. .. urli '-"... 2 
inspections after the spill 
showed only about half that 

r~ired material was used. 
The state was unaware of 

that problem, Reynolds said, 
because "we made no detailed 
inspection after completion. 
We authorized the engineer 
retained by the company to 
supervise construction and 
make the final inspection. We 
made . no regular inspections; 
their engineers were 
responsible for that." 

No state inspections were 
made, Whiteman added, 
because "we considered that a 
dam under construction." As 
originally built in 1977, it was 
a "starter dam" that stood 38 
to 40 feet high. However, 
there were plans to increase its 
height to 70 feet as storage 

~e became ~eded, he said. 
Those plans officially kept the 
dam in the under-construction 
category, even though it had 
been used for two years. 

Monitors that would have 
detected seepage from the 
dam were not required for the 
starter stage, WIl.ternan said, 
but wotlld be reqtJlI'ed tor the 
addition. 

Questions about health 

dangers because of the spill 
are still largely unanswered. 
Health officials are particular-
ly worried about long-term 
e.ffects that could show up in 
20 to 30 years, noting the spill 
included not only radiation, 
but poisonous heavy metals ' 
such as arsenic, lead and 
radium. 

Both New Mexico and 
Arizona have issued warnings 
for people and livestock to stay 
away from the Rio Puerco 
River. For the Indians this 
means finding and 
affording - water and feed for 
the sheep and goats that 
usually graze and drink along 
the now dangerous river. It has 
meant hauling in water from 
Gallup, and foregoing the 
meat their livestock supplied 
for the family table because of 
possible contamination. There 
are 339 people and 2,500 
livestock in the immediate 
Church Rock area. 

Whether human health has 
been, or will be, affected, may 
not be known for years. 
Shortly after the spill, Dr. 
Winterer, staff pediatrician for 
the Indian Health Service in 
Gallup, demanded that several 
Navajo children who had been

In a landmark case set to

Judge Norbert Elvenfreund 
late next month, attorneys for 
the sophisttcated UCSD

viewing the Julie Christie 
mOvie, "Demon Seed." You 
might recall a similar, more 
serious case occurring three 
years ago at Princeton 
University, where an IBM 

computer attempted' to seize 
control of the campus by 
sabotaging a fmear accelera-
lor and etectrocubng two 

technicians during a 
subsequeht attempt to 
deactivate it. A plea of 
insanity was accepted by the 
Court, based on the 
Computer's attempted suicide 
by short-circuiting and on the 
assertion by the IBM's 
attorneys that repeated 
exposure to such films as 
"Colossus·-the F orbin Project" 
and "2001--a Space 
Oddessey" had warped its 
value chips and eroded its 
morality circuits. Although 
encounter !,troup therapy and 
psychotherapy have been 
thus ' far ' ine1feciive 'in 
rehabilitating the IBM, it is 
hoped that Ted Patrick and 
several technicians from the 
3M Company will be able to 
effectively deprogram it.

tests at the Los Alamos 
Scientific Laboratory detected 
no thorium, one of the major 
known carcinogens in the spill. 

But the tests "don't mean 
anything," Dr. Winterer said , 
because thorium is not 
detected by the procedures 
used , He is "pressuring" to set 
up a registry for all the people 
who have been exposed to the 
spill , he said, so tha t problems 
developed la ter might be 
tracked. 

" I think this spill will be like 
what happened during the 
A-bomb tests in l Jtah during 
th e 1950s ," h e said. 
Abnormally high cancer rates 
have been recently reported in 
communities exposed to those 
tests two decades or more ago.

"blue collar workers are 
currently in most need of 
representation, especially 
custodians, who have been 
messed over by the 
university." 

The elimination of the 
custodial night shifts caused 
conflict between the university 
and custodial staff last year. 

Orlofsky says the election of 
a bargaining representative 
will force the university into 
operating on a "different level" 
with union employees. 

AFSCME has been 
working toward systemwide 
representation of union 
employees since a bill was 
passed last year by the State 
Legislature permitting 
collective bargaining in the UC 
system.

Mexico 's environmental 
department indicate that 
contamination is spreading

said the sta te wi ll conhnually

supplying the popular Petrified 
Forest park in the future . 

Meanw hil e, controversy 
continues over whether United 
Nuclear is cleaning up 
adequately. Charles Ofel t, 
spokesman for United 
Nuclear , said "the clei:!nup is 

going quite satisfactorily," a 
pomt supported by the 
Environmental Protection 
Agency office in Dallas . 

. "We've cleaned up all the 
visible material, about 1,540 
tons of potentially a ffected 
sediment," he said, using 
crews of about 4(} a t a time 
working wit,h shovels and 
buckets. 

But the Navajos cl clim it 
was a month before any real 
cleanup b gan, and then only 
after they started loud 
protests . Navajos and state 
officials interviewed said there 
were no more than 15 men 
working at a time.

underway to greatly expand 
New Mexico's uranium 
industry, which a lready
