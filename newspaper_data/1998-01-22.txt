Depauw Sorority 
Burns Pledge. 
GREENCASTLE, Ind . -
Depauw University found 
three Kappa Kappa Gamma 
sorority members guilty of 
branding pledges with ciga-
rettes ; the members face a 
semester-long suspension 
and other punishments. The 
three women - Amanda 
Heldt, Sarah McKinney and 
Jennifer Miller - appealed 
their previous expulsion sen-
tence last month on the 
grounds that the punishment 
was too severe. Depauw has 
no Greek Judicial Board, so, 
the cases would normally 
have gone to the Student 
Conduct Board . However. 
Dean of Students Alan Hill 
decided not to con vene the 
Student Conduct Board 
because of bad ti ming. So, 
instead, Hill brought the 
cases before what he ca ll s 
the Admin is tra ti ve Hearin g 
Board - a group that looks 
like the Student Conduct 
Board minus one student and

" I like the idea or get-

weeks instead of 18," said 
Brian Weldy, a Warren

interest in the long period 
of time that semester class-

Many of the UCSD stu-

NFL Public Relations 
Inadequate for Superbowl 

In case you didn ' t know already, Super Bowl 
XXXII is th b wt:ekend. The Green Bay Packers and 
the Denver Broncos art: pmparing to face olT at 
Qualcomm Stadium. and the Packers are practici ng at 
UCSD 's very ow n panos Athleti Complex. 

Thi s is :.J good thing, or so most people would 
think. So did one of our news edito rs, who thought 
thaI a shot of the Packers doing their thing would be 
the perfect feature photo for today's Guardian . 

Unfortunately, the Packers and their NFL handlers 
thought otherwise. The practices are understandably 
c losed to the public - nobody wants to see Brett 
Favre's moment in the sun spoi led because the Broncos 
got ahold of his latest moves. However, a photo of a 
player on the 'idelines shouldn ' t be a problem. 

We tried and tried to get pe rmission to go onto the 
field for the five minutes that it woul~ take to get our 
photo. The Packers ' secrets would be safe with us . 
Unfortunately, nobody could or would give us per-
mission - or even a straight answer one way or the 
other. 

It is sad that the league's rules concerning media 
coverage are so confusing and misleading that no one 
knows what the actual policy is , or if it even exists. 

We finally got our photo, but it wasn't easy - or 
ofticially sanctioned . We understand the leam's 
desire for privacy, but it's sad that "the powers that 
be" won ' t cut the campus newspaper any slack.

PININ 

THESE ARE THE HOMELESS 
IN-My NEIGHBORHOOD 

COMMENTARY: Homeless people in Pacific Beach have mastered the art of 
annoyance by throw!ng parties and sleeping in this columnist's private carport 

JESSYC 
WALLACE 

, Messing With 
Your Mind 

Wl!lcome to anoth er episode or 
"Life Sucks" or "The People in my 
Neighborhood." 

Never in my life did I imagine that 
1 would blame an administration for 
my problems. Now, not only is the 
UCSD administration a constant thorn 
in m)' side, but I can add the Reagan 
administration to the list of trouble 
makers in m)' li fe. 

Reagan shut down state-run mental 
institutions to save mone)', build more 
prisons, make more weapons, etc. 

It is more or less common knowl-
. edge that when releasing patients from 

a mental hospital, they do not become 
functioning, table member of society 
unless the)' have a family that loves 
them or are deliriously wealthy and 
can afford private institutional care. 
This is the reason there are exorbitant 
numbers of homeless people wander-
ing around, wreaking havoc in my 
neighborhood. 

I live in "downtown" Pacilic Beach 
about a block and a half from the 
beach. When I moved in I Ihought , 
"Great apartment, great location, 
tumbling distance from the bar, I'm 

set" Ah. to be young and naive. 
The apartment has its advanlages, it 

is huge. However, the owner is waiting 
to tear the building down and if I want-
ed, I could probably have it l!on-
demned within a week. 

We have termites and the owner 
won ' t tent the building. Our property 
managers spy on us from their office 
acros the street. 

The place is so poorl)' insulated 

As I was watching 
television the other 
night, I he.d this 
strange screaming, 
almost caterwauling. I 
looked out my window 
.nd saw • wo .... n 
frantically yelling, 
MHow can I love 
myself, I've hurt my 
own 'eel In,,?" 
Ihat it costs approximately S 120 per 
month to heat thc place up to about 62" 
which, when put through cost-benefit 
analysis, indicated we are better off 
freezing all winter. 

My bathroom frequentl), floods 
into the hair salon downstairs, result-
ing in an endless trail of handymen 
leaving muddy footprints in m)' tub. 

All things considered, the biggest 
problem with my apartment has more 
to do with its location. 

I don't mind the traffi c, I. don ' , 
mind the noi e of drunken college stu-
dents wandering through the neighbor-
hood, and I love how close all the 
restaurants and bars arc - no' to men-

lion the beach . 
The prob lem is, though. Ihat our 

central location and our ni ft y ca rport 
on an alley make our apartmell l the 
local Homeless Hotel. 

About three weeks after we moved 
in, the problems started. The home l e~s 
throw a party in our carport. There is 
booze, music, bo isterous laughter at 
6: 17 a.m. Needless to sa)" we were 
slightly alarmed. 

At Ii rst, these parties scared us; we 
would call our propert y manager and 
ask them what to do. Of course, we 
had to wait for help until 9:30 a.m., 
when the)' showed up for work - but 
he)" beller late then never. 

As I was leaving for school one 
morning, there were six or seven drunk 
guys laying around near my car. I said 
good ' morning and got in, thinking, 
"Cool, they 're not going to make me 
late for school." I started my car and 
the one in a wheel chair pulled up to 
my door, blol!king me from leaving. 

[ rolled down my window and 
asked him what he wanted. Any guess-
es'? That is right, he wanted liquor. So 
I politely told him r did not have any 
and that r was running late for school 
so I would appreciate if he could kind-
ly back up a lillie. 

Next he asks me if I would buy him 
some. My response was, ''I'm not 21. I 
can' t even buy myself any liquor." 
That satisfied hi m and he let. me drive 
away. 

These minor disturbances contin-
ued for a whi Ie and we just took it , fig -
uring not calling the police was in the 
best interest of the safety of our cars 
- not to mention ourselves. Since 
then, we have learned that although 
these people are harmless, they are 
extremely annoying.

ECLECTIC E-MAIL ERUPTION 
By Jenny Nlchotson

not I"orgollen me. M)' hand shakes 
slightt )' as I move the mouse to the 
"Get Mail" hUllon , and I hold my 
breath as the I W() messages down-
load. 

The lirst is from John Smi th . I 
do nOI recall knowing him, but I 
open it an)'way, hoping that per-
haps he is a long-lost family mem-
ber who has changed hi s name. To 
my utter disappointment , John is 
only writing to tell me (and the rest 
uf the student body) thai the 
Underwater basketweaving Teani is 
holding its annual tryouts. For one 
brief moment. [ actually consider 
responding - but before my 
impulse gets the best of me, I chuck 
John 's message. 

M)' sel.:Ond message is actually 
from someone I know - a long-
lost hi gh school friend hailing 
from that never-never land more 
commonly known as UC Santa 
Barbara. In my excitement to have 
real mail , 1 miss that sign of 
impending doom in the subject box 
Ihat says "Fwd." 

I open the message, and then 
spend 15 minutes s(;rolling down 
hundreds of addresses of people I 

In 4-lnch 'etters, , 
am told by some 
person from Wichita 
that "If you don't

slow death Involving 
every tool of the 
Spanish Inquisition." 
have never heard of. I have long 
~in(;e given up the hope of a per-
sonal greeting, but now, as I scroll , 
I pray that the message will be at 
least somewhat amusing, like that 
one about all the cool things we 
had in the 80's. 

When I get to the bottom, my 
eyes widen and a vein begins to 
pulse in my forehead as I read the 
message my friend has been so 
thoughtful to send me. In 4-inch 
letters, I am told by some person 
from Wichita ,that "If you don ' t 
send this message to 20 people in 
the next 20 minutes , then you will 

die a 10\\1 death invol ing e\cr

HOMELESS: 
Biting the hand that 
feeds them 
C ............ ".. ..... 4 
the morning sitling on our stairs 
smoking pot, and the Midnight 
Defecator, we were pretty much 
fed up and started calling the 
police. 

Does it or docs it not say on 
every single police car in San 
Diego "Ameri ca's Finest, to Protect 
and to Serve"'! Apparently the 
police do not like coming out to 
co llect or disperse homeless peo-
ple. 

Once, my friends and I were 
drinking in my apartment before a 
party. Except for our designated 
driver, we were all prelly drunk. I 
drive a car that has daytime running 
lights, so as soon as the car stans, 
the headlights come on. 

Apparently, thi s huge, burly, 
hairy, dirty homeless guy was 
sleeping in front of my car. The dri -
ver turned on the engine and sud-
denly, in front of the car, popped up 
the Abominable Homeless Man. 
Needless to say, he scared the 
begeebers out of us. 

Another time, the Abominable 
Homeless Man was hanging out in 
our alley and drinking with his 
friends for an entire day. By sunset, 
he was totally smashed and throw-
ing glass bollies in the alley. We 
called the police because he was 
dangerous. 

After they arrested him for pos-
sess ion of marijuana, they went 
through his shopping cart, wearing 
rubber gloves and moving things 
with a tongue depressor. We didn ' t 
blame them. They found more 
drugs, stolen mail and all kinds of 
other junk. 

Lately, though, my experi ences 
have not been quite so amusing. As 
I was watching television the other 
night, I heard this strange scream-
ing, almost caterwauling. I looked 
out my window and saw a woman 
frantically ye lling, "How can I love 
myself, I' ve hurt my own fee lings?" 

Curious about the situati on, ( 
looked up and down the street in 
search of someone she might be 
ye lling at. Finding no one present, I 
called 911 thinking this woman 
was a probably a serious threat to 
herself, if not to someone else. 

Currently, there i. a guy living

was in a good mood, (asked him if 
he was hungry. He said he was 
starving, so I gave him my huge 
portion of chicken and eggplant 
parmesan. 

Later that night, my roommate 
gave him a cigarene and a Coke_ I 
even pulled my car back one night 
so that he could sleep behind it. 

Now I rea li ze that in light of all 
the stories I have told so far, our 
behavior sounds a bit foolish . Keep 
in mind, though, that I was just try-
ing to do something nice for some-
one who probably needed it. 
Besides, this is the kind of guy 
who, when he has two blankets, 
gives one to another homeless guy 
su he won' t be cold. 

I left my apartment the other 
morning and this guy and a bunch 
of his fri ends were hanging around 
making nasty faces at me. . 

Then, las t night at II :30, this 
guy was in our carpon. It wasn't 
raining, and he was listening to his 
music so loudly that we could hear 
the words to the songs. Then hi s 
friends came by and they started 
making all kinds of noi se. 

My roommate had an 8 a.m. 
class and r was sick, so we called 
the police, not 91 I, just the non-

emergency number. 1be woman on 
the phone asked me four times if 
I'd .be willing to sign a Noise 
Complaint if it came to thaI. 

Duh, if I'm calling to complain 
about noise, then I'm probably seri-
ous enough to sign a complaint. 
Did she think r had nothing beller 
to do than to harass homeless peo-
ple and make San Diego cops work 
at 11 :30p.m.? . 

Two police cars showed up. One 
cop, on his way to ask the home-
less guy to leave, stopped under the 
window my roommate and I were 
watching from . He looked at us and 
waved. 

Hello! Why don ' t we j ust make 
it obvious who I.:alled the cops, so 
the homeless guy can come up and 
break into our apartment in a fit of 
rage'! 

The policeman gave us a look of 
death - an ellpression so nasty that 

. it turned my stomach. ( felt I had 
done something wrong in asking 
the police to remove a trespasser.. 

Meanwhile, mueh to my liking, 
my property manager installed a 
"No Trespassing" sigl'l in our car-
port and filed a trespasser removal 
order thi s morning. Maybe now I 
will get a whole night 's sleep.

colleges. 

Over 75 percent of the nation's 
research schools run on the semes-
ter system. 

Those in favor of the quarter 
system argue that the benetits of 
the semester system would not be 
worth the trouble involved in mak-
ing the switch. They argue that the 

understanding that you can't have 
sex without love," Nastos said. 
"People who listen to jazz under-
stand that when you t:o mbine· the 
two, it means a great deal more. 
When people understand that, it 
takes SCl( to a higher level." 

Siddall expressed both amusc-
ment and confusion about some of 
the factors the study linked to sexual 
drive, including politics and religion. 

'" admit , don' t watch much 
television or play many sports. but 
I seriously doubl that these explain 
why people with a.graduate educa-
tion have less sex," Siddall said. 

Siddall, whose Biology 101 
class is conducting a sex study via 
the Internet, said many factors

semester system will detract from 
student education, as the switch 
could lead to larger lectures and 
sections. 

They also argue that another 
downside of the semester system is 
that the lesser number of classes 
taken in a year could force some 
students to spend more time in 
school to earn their degrees . 

'" had a choice between 
Berkeley and UCSD," said Muir 
freshman , Kendra Weinisch. '" 
chose UCSD solely on the fact that 
they run on the quarter system." 

Critics also argue that the com-
plete overhaul of ex isting curricula 
that would be required to make the 
switch would be too costly and 
time consuming. 

Furthermore. critics say the 
semester system would cut down 
on faculty research time and could 
possibly drive away prospective 
faculty. 

to the Chicago study. 
"S leep patterns can dramatically 

influence circulating hormone lev-
els and sex drives. Do academics 
have abnormal sleep patlerns'! I 
don 't know, but it wouldn't sur-
prise me. There aren't too many of 
us. who follow a nine- to- five daily 
regimen," Siddall said. 

Rackham College student 
Jennifer Ladd said that graduates 
students' focus on the future may 
explain the low number of sexual 

. encounters. 
"We' re in a program becausc we 

have plans for the future," Ladd 
said. "So if we're investing so 
much time and energy into these 
plans, we may be really choosy in 
picking a mate."

Rocket From The Crypt Blast Into OCSD · 
San Diego's first and only rock 'n'roll band' is back in the mainstream limelight 

. By Ilona Fas. 
CcrHiatus Editor . 

Back with a blast, Rocket From 
the Crypt have made thei r way to 
their hometown just in time to 
kick-off Super Bowl Weekend. 

Veterans of UCSD may 
remember when this electric nand 
played at the Sun God Festival two 
years ago. 

But. for those who arc not 
familiar with Rocket From the 
Crypt. the first thing that will 
catch ones eye are their names (all 
of which are rea l). To begin with, 
there's Speedo on vocals and gui-
tar, N.D. on gui tar. Petey X on 
bass, Atom on drums, Apollo 9 on 
saxophone and J.C. 2000 on trum-
pet. 

In an interview with the 
Guardian in 1996, saxophonist 
Apollo 9 expressed regret at. not 
being able to perform more often 
in San Diego, allributing the diffi-
cu lty to rigid San Diego laws. 

"I feel bad," Apollo said. ''This 
is home, and J remember being a 
kid and not being able to go to 
shows. It really upset me." 

As for how he got hi s name, 
Apollo said that what started out 
as a j¥e, turned into a "dopey 
rock n' roll thing, like The 
Ra"lones." 

With their 1996 release 
Scream Dracula Scream, the prod-
uct of a month-and-a-half of hard 
work and determination, Rocket 
From the Crypt deviated from past 
albums which featured a noisy, 

~()mcti mes dallered sound and 
took on a newer more structured 
sound. 

Although the band may be 
leaning towards a more main· 
stream sound , fans have nothing to 
fear; this was still Rocket From the 
Crypt at their best.

CRASHERS: 
~ka band set to 
headline Winterfest 
Continued from PICe 9 
cool and we like that record. 
H.". .. the band ....... ben 
been into ska for a while? 

Yeah, everybody likes ska. 
Some of the guys have more of a 
punk-rock ~ackground. Karina and 
I both grew up listening to a lot of 
ska, a lot of soul , mod, rockabilly 
and punk. It's really varied, but 
everybody 's enjoyed ska for a long 
time, like a lot of the tWO-lOne stuff 
- The Specials, Madness. 
You had a hom _tion on 
the first album, what .... 
pened to that? 

We just ·decided we qidn ' t want 
horns anymore. Also, almost every 
ska band today has them, which i~ 
another reason we don't. 
Why did the band break up 
a few years 8&0? 

The only reason is that we just 
weren't having fun at the time. We 
had finished this record and Moon 
was supposed to be pUlling it out, 
and that got delayed for over a 
year. It was just a lot of waiting and 
we went on to go do other things 
for a while. 
Do you draw a lot of com· 
parisons to other female-
fronted ska bands? 

Every once in awhile. A lot or 
the writers we talk to are the same 
ones that we talked to like four 
years ago, so [ think most of them 
know beller than to do thaI. In 
Europe we get compared to No 
Doubt quite a bit, but other than 
thut it 's been prelly good. A lot of 

. the writers have really set us apart 
from both No Doubt ~nd Save Fer-
ri s, which has been nice. 
It seemed that Lockjaw had 
more of a straight·ahead 
punk influence, whereas 
Honey, I'm Homely had 
more of a two-tone 15ka 
sound. Was that just a nat· 
ural progression? 

It . was really natural. We defi-
nitely want all of our reeurds tu 
sound different and we do lhat 
intentionally. When we were get -
ting ready to make Lcckjaw, one of 
the reasons we put so much punk in 
is because nobody at the time was 
really doing that. 

After our record came out there 
was this huge insurgence of ska-
core and everything else, so we're 
not going to come out and make a 
ska-core record, beeause how bor-
ing would that be? Everybody went 
that direction so we went another 
direction, and there detinitely are 
some two-tone influences. 

There's also a 101 of '60s girl-
group influences/ some rockabilly, 
some retro stuff because nobody was 
really doing that, at least not yet. 

It's not that we were trying to 
incorporate those things, it's just a 
lot of what we were' listening to at 
the moment. 
WINd kind of ....... do you 
enjoy pIayIna wttb1 

We like to play with a lot of 
punk bands. We ' re going to Europe 
with NOFX in May, and on our last 
U.S, tour we had MxPx out with us. 
It's a lot of fun, a lot of the kids are 
really fun to play to and it's fun for 
us 10 watch. 

That's a really important thing 
for us when we go on tour. This is a 
band you're going to see every 
night for one or two months, you'd 
better like it. I think it's good 10 mix 
it up too, because if you have three 
ska bands or three punk bands play-
ing together, it gets monotonous.

Muir TV Just Says 'Whatever' 

Triton Cable's weekly show is the answer for dorm-room boredom 
By Jonah Freedmlln 
Senior Staff Writer 

Now that Jerry Seinfeld has 
announced that "Seinfeld" is in its 
last season, there is seemingly 
nothing to jill the television void 
left by the show about nothing. 
Muir TV. however, has its own 
weekly answer - "The Whatever 
Live Show." 

Hosted by three Muir students, 
senior Jeremy Cole, sophomore 
Ben Gleiberman and freshman 
Kristin Withers, "The Whatever 
Live Show" is the anti-talk show, 
loosely based around nothing. 

Every Thursday night from 10 
to II p.m., the zany trio sits on 
couches in a crudely-converted 
makeshift studio in Tioga Hall and 
discusses ... absolutely nothing, 

"The Whatever Live Show" 
began a year ago as a weekly com-
mentary of NBC's "Must-See TV" 
in a studio in the Muir Residantial 
Life Office. Taking phone calls and 

• consulting each other, hosts Cole. 
Gleibertnan and two other since-
departed students would literally 
discuss and critique "Friends." 
"Seinfeld" and "ER." 

" soon transformed into 'The 
Whatever Live Show" when the hosts 
began to rea lize that everyone had in 
fact seen the shows. With a busy 
switchbciard of viewers w,mting to 
simply shoot the breeze with a mad-
cap group of gently-demnged hosts . 
the show devolved into nothing. 

"We'd seriously sit·there for 
four hours and take nOles on the 
shows," says Cole. who. Wilh 
Gleibennan, co-emceed the 1997 
Sun God Festival. "We didn't real-
ly have to prove to Ithe viewers] 
that we 'd seen the shows." 

Today, Cole, Gkiberman and 
Withers sit in front of the cameras 
for an hour and run their shtick for 
whoever cares tu tunc in. Answer-
ing phone calls and receiving ran-

Shameless Plug: · Whatever Live Show" hosts (from left) Ben 
Gleiberman, Jeremy Cole and Kristin Withers improvise on-cue. 

dam walk-i n guests, the hosts 
entertain their audienee by enter-
taining themselves. 

A typical show may consist of 
placing Cole's head on Withers' 
body with picture-in-picture tricks. 
On one particular occasion, 
Gleiberman's head was transferred 
to a toy Gumby's body, which 
would in tum perform lewd acts 
with a toy Pokey. According to 
Gleiberman, 'There's nothing an 
audience loves more than clayma-
tion sex ." 

Phone ca ll s often corne from 
intoxicated home viewers wonder-
ingjust what is going on in that stu-
dio. Cole (featured in a GU(Jrdian 
"Face" feature in the Oct. 20 issue) 
is used to these inquiries. "We 
don ' t know what we're goi ng to do 
until we get here," he says. "We 
come in here Wilh no ideas." 

Other parts of the "Whatever" 
routine include hyphenating every-
onc's last names with "-Rosen-
berg;·' taking phone ca ll s from 
"Patel," a regular caller who imi-
lates a convenience-store clerk and 
always asks to sec "boobies ;" ano 
answering call s with the familiar, 

"What's up, you're on the phone." 
Cole, Gleiberman and Withers 

have crafted ''The Whatever Live 
Show" into something out of noth-
ing. While Gleiberman also hosts 
Muir TV's "The Gleib Show" 
(Mondays at 10 p.m.), the "What -
ever" crew hopes to continue the 
show next year. despite losing Cole 
to graduation. 

"Onee Jeremy leaves th is show, 
there will be a void on this \.:Ouch 
that can only be fill ed by .omeone 
else," . says Gleiberman . "We 
already have a possible lead for the 
ro le - the drummer from Han ·on. 
I' ve also gOllen calls from Ellen 
DcGcneres." 

Whatever the case, "The What-
ever Live Show" is good, mindless 
entertainment from some of 
UCSD's best personalitics. II may 
be 'vastly different from "Sein fc ld ," 
but if you tunc in, you'll also be 
asking, "Who are these people'!" 

"Conan O'Brien once said. ' If 
you put a monkey in front or the 
camera for two years, it'll get bel-
ter,''' says Calc. "We ' ve been 
doing the show for a year now. and 
I'm not so sure."

Skoolin': St. LQuis ska band Isaac Green & The Skalars brought their high-energy 
mix of s ka , swing and rock 'n' roll to the Showcase Theatre Saturday night. 

Dancing The NightAway 
Isaac Green & The Skalars kept the crqwd moving 

By Scott Yager 
Co-Hiatus Editor 

These days, ska bands tend to fall into 
one of two camps. The "traditional" bands 
usually draw heavily from ska bands of yes-
teryear, such as The-Skatalites, 'f~Spccials 
and Madness, making dance-ball reggae and 
rock steady their main staple. Other bands 
cater to the "ska-core" crowd. relying on 
frantic , upstroke guitar, possibly horns and a 
healthy dose of punk-rock fury. 

. Isaa(.: Green & The Skalars arc one of 
those groups that fall into a happy medium 
between the two. The SI. Louis band 
brought its distinctive mix of ska, swing, 
punk and '50s rock 'n' roll to the Showcase 
Theatre Saturday night in support of its 
album Sk()oiin' with The Slwlars. 

When The Skalars took the stage, the rel-
atively small but enthusiastic LTowd began 
to stir in anticipation. The band immediate-
ly launched into "Spoiled Brat," the first 
track from Skooiin', whi(.:h set the audience 
off into a dancing frenzy. The crowd never 
tired, but seemed to gain more energy 
throughout The Skalars' hour-long set. 

.. 

Highlighted by the su ltry vocal stylings 
of lead singer/saxophonist Jessica Butler, 
The Skalars blended together a potent mix of 
fine musicianship and raw energy, culminat-
ing in a highly-animated and wonderfully-
tight performance. 

In addition to the bouncy, new-school ska 
of "Spoiled Brat," highlights of the show 
included the energetic, rockabilly-swing of 
"Bloodshot Eyes," the slow groove of "Pup-
pet Lover" and the hyperkinetic "Sitting." 

The solid rhythm section of drummer 
Dave Sharma and bassist Willie Horton pro-
vided a steady an(.:hor throughout the night , 
alternating between smooth and stylish and 
powerful, thundering bealS. 

Guitarist Ethan D'Ercole and key-
boardist Jason Brody contributed smooth, 
elegantly constructed melodies that kept the 
crowd moving. 

Trombonist Evan Shaw was perhaps the 
most active member of the group, sometimes 
flailing around wildly and sometimes break-
ing into humorous New Kids on the Block-
ish dance moves, all the while contributing 
vocals that complemented Butler's nicely.

SIIIooth Talker: Irv (Ken Bryant) tells another one of his fantastic stories and 
keeps the aud ience in stitches in O'Mary's bar. 

Cheers to 'O'Mary's' Success 
Neighborhood bar is scene for new musical comedy 

By Ilona Faas 
Co-Hiatus Editor 

In an era in which a playboy cast and glib 
lines almost guarantee a packed auditorium, 
it is refreshing to see that the central charac-
ters in a musical saturated with love, jeal-
ousy and intrigue neither c.ookie-cutter 
cute nor predictably square. 

Playwrighters Ric Barr, Beverly Bremers 
and Wayne TIbbetts have created full-bodied 
characters - with dynamic personalities to 
boot - in Diversionary Theater's presenta-
tiQn of the off-the-track comedy "O'Mary's." 

Nestled in a cozy loft in Hillcrest, Diver-
sionary Theatre proves that great things 
really do come in small packages. As with 
each of the presenta\ions shown by Diver-
sionary, one of the main themes addressed in 
"O'Mary's" deals with the challenges of 
being homosexual. 

The -vehicle through which to tell these 
and other stories is O'Mary's, the neighbor-
hood bar, which has become home to a 
tightly-knit group of people whose drama 
and personal stories add more punch to the 
scene than a double rum-and-coke. 

Suffi(.:e it to say that when the city threat-
ens to tear down t his mecca of theme parties 
and good till1c ~. Ihc locals will not give up 
without a fight. 

The plot successfully walks the fine line 
of broaching controversial and difficult 
issues such as HIV, alcoholism and infi -
delity, without being sticky-sweet or over-
ly dramatic. 

Outrageous costumes and the some-
times-campy quality of the cast proves to be 
"O'Mary 's" strength . Simply put, the 
O' Mary 's experience as a whole , the live 
music, the jokes and the costumes, com-
bined with the adventure of going to this 
hidden gem of a theatre in Hillcrest, makes 
this an evening well spent. 

Performances continue every Thursday, 
Friday, Saturday and Sunday evenings 
through Feb. 21 at the Diversionary Theatre, 
4545 Park Blvd. (between Monroe and 
Madison). 

Ticket prices are $12 Thursdays and Sun-
days, and $15 Fridays and Saturdays. Dis-
counts for students are available at the box 
office. Fur more information. call 220-0097.

DOMINANT: 
This Friday will be 
a tough test. .. 
Continued from pace 16 
afford to slip up against a team that 
is better than nearly all of the 
Tritons' regular opponents. 

"We certainly haven' t played a 
team of Christian Heritage's (.:al-
iber," Triton Head Coach Greg 
Lanthier'said. "During this streak, 
we've played only three teams that 
had winning records." 

Howeve,., no one is really sure 
of UCSD's caliber. [f freshman 
standout center Tyler Field had 
been with the team all season, the 
Tritons would surely have fewer 
than four losses. Since his arrival 
the team has yet to lose, blowing 
out teams by an average of 18 
points per game, 

UCSD has certaillly used the 
home court to its advantage. The 
team has been undefeated · at 
RI¥AC this season, but to main-
tain that streak, the Tritons. must 
pass this severe test. A rowdy Spirit 
Night (.:rowd will no doubt be in 
effect to spur the homeboys on. 

"They match up well with us 
and vice versa, we match up well 
with them," Lanthier said. "It 
should be a good game." 

It will no doubt be an important 
game, but with a huge UCSD 
crowd out in full force this Friday, 
the Tritons expect nothing short of 
a victory. 

"At home, on spi rit night, I think 
we should beat Christian Heritage," 
forward Mike Wall said. "They are 
a good team. If we can beat them, 
that will show that we should win 
the rest of our games." 

TROUBLES:

goggles for a while

f'd be able to payoff my hnes. 

No more. I can't blame it on bad 
luck anymore. I went to Mexico 
over the weekend with a group of 
mostly-inebriated friends. While 
gazing from atop a cliff at the spec-
tacular view of Ihe ocean in an 
unusually sober (.:ondition, I came 
to the conclusion that even though 
the Packers, who I like less than a 
horse's patoot, will be playing in 
my adopted hometown this week-
end; life is pretty good. 

This Sunday, when the Pack 
takes on Elway and the Broncos, 
)'11 be watching with neither jubi -
lance nor excitement. However, it 
is football. I must watch, and watch 
] will . ] guess it will be my job to 
make sure my bros don't throw up 
on the T.V. . 

Is Terrell Davis, who had hi s 
high school jersey retired this week 
(whoopee!), going 10 carry hi s 
squad to the Lombardi Trophy? 
Will Favre do ..yhat he always does, 
systematically find the weakness in 
every defensive look and exploit it'! 
We'll see, and I'll remember this 
Supcr Bowl because I won't be 
boozing (the last few are a bit 
hazy). Remember, I'm in a transi -
tional phase right now. 

In addition, I'll be able to make 
it to my 5 p.m. intramural basket-
ball game without reeking of malt-
ed hops (the rest of my leam prob-
ably will stink, whi(.:h should make 
for some very loose defending on 
the pan of our competition). Until 
next time, loyal readcr~. 
Remember, enjoy the moment for 
whatever iI'S worth . 

ROLLING: 
UCSD is beginning 
to put it all together 
~ frOM pace 11 
defeat. A close loss to Chapman 
on the eve of New Year's Eve left 
the Tritons at 7-3 and postseason 
prospects appeared on the verge of 
flickering out. 

Fortunately, 1998 has been a 
different story. Facing an uphill 
road to the playoffs, the Tritons 
have responded with six straight 
victories. winning by an average 
margin of 35.5 points. Team 
defense and strong outside shoot-
ing have fueled the streak, and at 
13-3, UCSD is in position for a 
run 'I' the postseason. 

TIle road to March Madness is 
anything but cupcake city, as the 
team's remaining nine games are 
loaded with quality opponents. 

Looming largest on the schedule 
is a Feb. 14 date at Chapman, a 
game which will go a long way in 
determining which team will play 
in March. 

UCSD must also play at 
Southern Cali(ornia College aild 
Pomona-Pitzer College, two 
games which should be highly 
competitive.

It has been awhile, Triton 
groupies, since I have poised 
my pen to write in this presti-
gious column . . Here I sit with 
the honor once again of giving 
you a taste of the wacky hap-
penings of UCSD sports and my 
life in general. 

Wouldn ' t it be just ducky if I 
could write about my 4gers 
using their home-field advan-
tage throughout the playoffs to 

The UCSD Guardian 

<I ' go all the way to l~e big dance'? 
If the 4gers had only played 

in an environment as cold as 
Minnesota 's old Metrop~litan 
Stadium, they would have bro-
ken the limbs off the Packers. 
Wait, never mind thaI. Lambeau 
Field is colder Iharr'the ArctiL' 
and we all know how the Pack 
plays there. 

If only we had fans who 
knew how to scream themselves 
into a coma, it might have mud-
died up Breit Favre's high-per-
formance offense. 

Enough with the "ifs" 
already. If :'if' were a fifth , we'd 
all be drunk. I like that little say-
ing. 

I'll tell you, the pain of 
defeat two weekends ago almost 
drove me to drinking, but as 
Samuel L. Jackson said in "Pulp 
Fiction," I' m in a transitional 
phase in my li fe right now. I ' m 
taking a brea ther from the 
hooze.

call "an eye-opening ex pen-

Do the lyrics " [ fought the I,iw 
and the law won" .ring a bel l? It 
made me rea li ze for some rea-
son with astonishing darity the 
value of my education here. 

In my brief stint here in col-
lege, I have been no stranger to 
trouble. In facl, il eems thai 
trouble has become my little 
stalker, trailing in the shadows, 
waiting fo r an opportunity to 
grab my cajones and give Ihem 
a snug tug.

Five games, fo ur losses - so

LUCKY SEVEN?: Head Coach Judy Malone 
and co. look to continue the streak this weekend 
By Jeff Bassett 
Staff Writer 

Tile bar has been raised and 
expectati ons are high. The 
women's athletic program here at 
UCSD has already had an excep-
tional year. 

The women's soccer team won 
its third straight National 
Championship, losing only two 
games en route to an impressive 
20-2 record . The women's vo lley-

ball team fo llowed uit , 
winning the national title 
despite fa lling behind two 
games in the championship 
malch. 

The women's basketball 
team? With each blowout 
wi n, the pos~ibili ty of this 
'quad maki ng it a th ree-
team wcep of the ational 

hampion. hip hecomes more 
vi able. A~ evidenced hy ullIrday 's 
w nvincing romp 01 hapmmf 

niver 'ity, thi ' leam i~ on a roll 
and ha~ the potential 10 improve 
upon la~ t year's ~e\.:ond-round e il 
from th' Di .. i~ i (Jn III po~t!tea~on . 

While the t ',lIn definitely ha 
its leader , it ha. been the team ' 
co llective effort wh ich ha put the 
w men in a posi tion to have a 
memorable year. 

The depth of this team is one of 

its greatest attribules. At least 10 
players receive quality mi nu tes 
eac h game. 

The back-courl trio of Jenessa 
Bayda, Amy McClure and Tristen 
Teasdale con istently deli ver from 
behind the arc. 

Amy Franzen continues to di s-
tribute the ball well from the point, 
while Kri sta Poehler's athletici III 
toward the hoop should prove 
inva luable down the stre tch. 

Summer Begley and Kat 
Turnbull dominate the inside, both 
on the offensive and defensive 
ends, whi Ie Marci Ernsberger 
alway seems to compete in J 
higher gear. 

The outlook wasn't always a~ 
hright for th is year\ team. The ~ea-
0 11 started promisi ngly enough, as 

the women dc~troyed an over-
matched Cal Te(.;h niversity team 

8-1 .. But as CSD student!> from 
the Los Angcle~ area can alte:.t. 

al Tech isn 't exa ·tly an Jthlet\(;' 
powerhouse. 

Th is became apparent when the 
TrJto n ~ confronted Wisconsln -
O!>hko h, losing theIr fir~t game (II 
the year, 67-49. 

Eighteen days IJter, Wisconsin-
Oshkosh dismantled U SO again, 
handing the team a 31-point
