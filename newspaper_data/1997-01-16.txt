JOBS: Civil right group: 
claim fair hiring practice of 
w men, minoritie. are at stake 
By Meera Pal 
StaffWnter 

In an cffort to halt the cnfort:cmcnt of the UC 
Board of Regents re~()IUlion SP- I, which elimi-
nates race-or gender-ba~cd prc ferences in gradu-
ate student admissions. the Mexican Amerit:an 
Legal Defense and Edu cational Fund 
(MALDEF) and the AA P Legal Defense amI 
Edut:a tional Fund (LDEF) filed a formal com-
plaint last Friday with the U.S. Department of 
Labor 

The t:Omplaint , filcd on behalf of minority 
and female graduate students, states that be-
cause the university is a fcderal contractor, it is 
obligated to ensure equal-opportunity employ-
ment in its hiring prat:tices. 

According lo MALDEF and LDEF, UC hir-
ing practit:es arc affet:lcd admission practices. 
because many posillons such as graduate- tu-
dent researchers and graduate-student Inslrut:-
tors are filled from Ihe pool of t:urrent UC 
graduate ~lUdents . 

"The U selects and pre-selet:ls its employ-
ees for .. . graduate-studenljob titles through ils 
graduate-student admission system," MALDEF 
staff allorney Thomas Saen!. . tated in Ihe leller 
of complai nt. 

MALDEF and LDEF argue that by ending 
race- and gender-hased preferences in graduate 
admissions. the UC violated its obligations as a 
federa l t:onlractor to cnsure equal-opportunilY 
employment. 

However, Susan Thomas, legal counsel fo r 
the university , argues that the UC has already 
ta ken steps to en!>ure equal opportunity in com-
pliance with federal hiring practices. 

,,'We still have affirmative action in place for 
employees, as far as it is required fromu~ and no 
further," she said.

Sample: Dave Wolgast , employee at the Mt. Soledad-located Scripps labs, carefully

of it every year. The samples are then distributed to other countries.

Sexual Halas5Il1ent Policy 
Respects Riglds of Accused 

A boss givt:~ one of hi:o. workers a pat on the shoulder; 
someone overhears a fellow employee telling a bawdy 
joke; a person asks a co-worker out on a date - all of 

the~e are examples of situations that co~~d be construed, 
or mi~construed, as "sexual harassment . 

While instances of serious misconduct do occur in the 
workplace, sexual harassment has become so~ething. of 
a CCllI.\'e celehre - a near-fixation for those With particu-
lar political axes to grind . Takt:. for instance, recent com-
ments hy June Terpstra. director of the SO Office of 
, exual Harassment Pn:vcntion and Poli cy: "Sexual 
harassment ha~ a d(Uerl'l1t set of rules ... we have to edu-
cate ourselve:o. about what - legally and socially -
should be done ." I mphasi~ oursJ 

Despile the claims of Ms . Terpstra , we believe that 
current university policy for dealing with sexual -harass-
ment claims is fair and halanced . The administration has 
no choice but to respect the due-process rights of the 
accused when adjudicating these or any other matters. 

It is of the utmost importance that people are not sub-
ject d to punishment and/or censure for crimes they did 
not commil. To abandon the pursuit of a fair judicial 
process in cases of sexual hara.ssme~t is to r:s~rrect the 
mob mentality of the Salem Witch tnal s. JudiCial pro-
ceedings shou ld be fairly administered even when the 
crime has become highly politicized . 

Indeed, sexual harassment is a hotly di sputed topic 
that tends to inspi re heated emotions. This is all the more 
reason to treat allegations of sexual harassment with 
extreme caution. taking an extra measure of care to bal-
ance the rights of the accused with those of the purported 
victim . When confusion abounds. it is important for 
those charged with meting out justice to maintain clear 
heads. We encourage the administration to stay the 
course and continue to respect the righls of those accused 
of sexual harassment. 

UnderglcDlate Leeming is 
Jeopardzed by Lazy lAs 

Nothing is more insulting to a student than having to 
deal with a teaching assistant (TA) who feels no obliga-
tion to attend lectures. It is an t:mbarrassment to the 
school when a student asks his or her TA about a point 
raist.:d in lecture. on ly 10 be told . "I don ' t know what Dr. 
, mith meant - I wasn ' t there ." 

A TA i ~ one or tht: most important ractors in under-
graduate education . Professors often don ' t hav~ time to 
address importallt i~sues during lecture. In sectton, a A 
provides students with an opportunity to tad,.le the finer 
points of Iht: l' our~e material in a smaller setllng. 

However. TAs who don ' t attend lecture often lead 
poor-quality discussions which arc of no use to students 
seeking clarification on specific points made by the pro-
fessor. TAs who don't attend Ie ·ture are not in tune with 
either the professor or the class . They have no under-

~tandi ng of what lecture topics might be con~usll1 g to a 
student if the professor muddles the explanatIOn. 

Other shocking examples of unprofessional ism include 
giving quizzes that are unrepre.sent.ative ~f the course. 
material . uncertainty about the bastc detatls of upcomlllg 
exams (such as whether it's multiple choice, short-ess~y, 
etc.) and ignorance of which points the professor constd-
ered important enough to emphasize in lecture. 

The TAs at UCSD who can do more with a 50-minute 
section than the professor does all week are 10 be com-
mended. However, "slacker" TAs who don't attend lec-
ture are nol assets to undergraduates at UCSD .

TRUE LIES: How TO BE A 
CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST 

COMMENTARY: Conservative writers use cheap rhetorical tricks 
and unprovable premises to attack their opponents' arguments 

~ 

B r e n t 
JOHNSON 

Smells Like 
The Trulh 

A funny Ihing occurred 10 me 
during vacation while perusing 
the editorial pages of the San Jose 
Mercury News: Within a couple 
paragraph, into a .:ommentary. I 
could determine whether the 
writer wa conservat i ve or not. 

I wondered about my new-
found ability. At first , I it had 
developed from reading 100 many 
editorial s and commentaries in 
the Union -
Tribune and 
the Guardian, 

where you find nothing hut conser-
vati ve opi nions. 

But Ihal answer was too basic. 
No. something else aboul these 
conservative writings triggered 
warning klaxons in my head that 
,cr.:amed. "Warning: You ha ve 
enten:d a conservative writa 's , in-
gular. twi,tcd view of realll y." 

ers and its failure to train or provide work for welfare 
recipients. Falk adequately describes the problem with 
the reforms with lillie or no verbal pork.. 

If only the same could be ~aid of Schreiber's com-
mentary. which employ all the characteristics.of the 
above list in the first three paragraphs. Companng the 
former welfare syslem with a debilitated automobile, 
"a loathsome bucket of boits ," is a false premise that 
must be discarded - it leads the reader to believe that 
the federal welfare syslem could not be salvaged or 
corrected, which simply isn ' t true. 

The piece wande r~ from its 
basi c premi,e With a mulli -line 
ridicule of Bill "Buhbll" Clinton. 
including a di~turbing account, 
meant to be funn y. of the presi -
denl' s purported while -trash 
upbringing (as if alluding to the 
president's hack ground did any-
thing to help the writer make bis 
poinl ). 

pOll \ tlllJying a collect ion of 
c()n ~e r vati\e writlng~, a peculiar 
pallern of characteri,li c\ c merge~ . 
The righi -wing writer, th roughout 
Ihe l:our,c of Ill'> commenlary. oft en 
elllploys: 

• words which painl a prelly, if 
fal,c, description of reality ; 

• fal~e pn:mi<;cs or anlilog ie~ : 
• di"cl11lnation of l11isinforl11a-

tioll ; 
• copious, dislral:ting pa~sagcs 

of ridicule. 

If you are confused, 
it's not your fault, 
but the writer's. This 
is an example of 
misinformation -
information 
arranged In a such a 
way that It can't 
make any sense. 

Worst of all arc tile dcscri pi ions 
that Schreiber cmploy;, 10 describe 
the welfare situation to the reader. 
For instance. de~c r i b i ng Ihe old 
system as "dragging Ameril:a ever 
deeper into Ii , cal lind moral quag-
mire" confuses the i,sue - certain-
ly linancial problem, ex isted with 
welrare. but how do you begin to 
describe the hest allempt by a gov-
ernmenl to help revitali le the lives 
of Ihe unemployed as a "moral" 
quagmire'! Callously throwing in 
the word makes the old welfare 
system appear to have heen a nefar-
ious atlemptto pull one over on the Cut OUt thi~ list and stuff it in 

your pocket for the next time you come lIcro.~~ a hit .01' 
conservative writing. A quick comparison with the list 
will often reveal an attempt at passi ng off disingenuous 
information as legitimate. 

For instance, if you read Monday 's focus issue fea-
turing Naomi Falk's and Chris Schreiber's discussion 
of the dismantling or welfare, the contrasts between 
the liberal and conservative positions couldn't be more 
pronounced - and the list couldn't be more use.ful. 

Falk, after writing about her personal expenences 
with welfare, goc on to list the consequences of wel-
fare reform. including its effects on children and moth-

public, but without an adequate explanalion as to how 
or why the attempt wa~ made. 

After digging through such instances as above, 
Schreiber finally got to the meat of hi s arguments, 
which were - if unsatisfactory to the liberal or mod-
erate viewpoint - not prepo terou . However. digging 
through the tripe huns the expression of the point - a 
characteristic of conscrvati ve columnists. ,

209 Injunction is Constitutional Nonsense," in

"If followed to its logical con-

the effect of turning Judges mto

should be given preferential trcat-
ment. ... The courts do not have any 
~pecial eKperti~e or wi\dom, nor do 
they have any right or competence,

In other word", legislation ought

whomever It wants, and the courts 
ought to hUll out. However, this

COMMENTARY: While the First Amendment guarantees freedom of expression, "The People vs. Larry Flynt" 
glamorizes a man who misused that that right, thus threatening the exercise of it by the rest of us 

NEW FILM GLORIFIES ABUSER OF FREE SPEECH 
By M.rk P.slcowltz 
Staff Writer 

"The People vs. Larry Flynt" is 
vin tage Oliver tone. It IS partially 
based on realilY. bUI reruses to let 
inconvenient facts get in the way 
of making a point. He sets up all 
the predictable straw-man oppo-
nents. takes every opportunity to 
thumb hi s nose at the establish -
ment and expects us to he grateful 
for it. The film it~elt I~ fairly 
entertaini ng. It i~ completely lack -
IIlg in subtlety, and it IS incredibly 
thought-provoking. 

And the film cnt ics and tho.: 
media cannot seem to pral~e it 
enough . For most films. it wou ld 
be enough for them to talk about 
the aCIing or the directing, and 
they have done plenty of that for 
this film . But they have also spent 
a 101 of time calling it "brave," 
"heroic," and even "patriotic." 
The reviewers have missed Ihe 
important lesson, though this is 
hardly surpri sing. The filmmakers 
themselves appear to have, at the 
very least, missed the important 
point of the story or, even worse, 
deliberately muddled it so as [0 
promote other agendas. 

Ostensibly, this is a film about 

freedom of expression and the 
importance of fighting tho e who 
would restnct this freedom . The 
prohlcm is that it end~ up lionizing 
a person who jeopardiJ.es this free-
dom for no good reason. The 
pornography and lowhrow humor 
that Flynt ' published c:on trihutcd 
nothing to society. Thi~ is not to 
say that they ~hould have been 
banned. but nei ther were they very 
good uses of precious rreedoms. 

"Why do I have to go 10 jail to 
protect your freedoms'?" Flynt 
demands of reporters 111 the movie. 
The answer is simply thi~ : 
Because you put them at nsk. 
Many reviewers and pundib like 
to point to the con~equences had 
the Supreme Court ruled against 
Flynt. Had the court found that 
public figure could sue for dam -
ages due to the emotional distress 
or satire, this truly would have had 
a chilling effect on public debate. 
But no one seems to mention that 
Ihere was no challenge to the free-
dom to satiri ze before Flynt 
pushed things far beyond the lim-
its of decency. "AIIl'm guilty of is 
bad taste," he says. Very much so. 
We should hold him accountable 
ror this, not elevate him. 

Not all that should 
be legal should be 
done, and certainly 
what should not 
be done should 
not be praised. 

Thi may seem like a major 
complaint about a minor issue, but 
it is not. Larry Flynt, and people 
like him who cry "First 
Amendment" to defend their right 
to tastelessness are like the boy 
who cried wolf, calling for atten-
tion at the cost or abusing an 
importam institution. Eventually 
people will stop paying attenti on. 
Then they will wonder ir changes 

need to he made . 
This i~ alread happening. The 

Jan . 4 issue of The Ec()n()~lIIs, con-
tallls an artide tilled "A slow 
retreat rrom frecdom ." It di~cusses 
the fact that people arc increaslI1g-
I)' starling to question th.: degree 
of freedolll al1o\ cd in this coun-
try. More and more people arc 
weighing the abstract va lue of 
freedom against the costs of an 
uncivil prcss. Ilag hurnlilg . court-
mandated athclsm and othcr ~uch 
exccs~es . More and more. they arc 
Jeclding Ihat frcedom has gone 
too far. 

Freedom is untcnahlc without 
responsihi lity. Few people seem to 
rea lilo.: thi~ . Freedom without 
responsibility lead~ to cha()~ . The 
Importance of rreedom is Ihat Ihe 
con trol comes from inside rather 
than being ex ternally imposed. but 
control is still necessary. Yes. it is 
important thai people have the 
freedom to do what society finds 
objectionable. but that does not 
mean that it is good to exercise 
that freedom. Not ali that should 
be legal should be done, and cer-
tainly what should 1101 be done 
hould not be praised. 

Many reviewers argue Ihat the 

All UCSD Students 

hero or the movie is not Flynt but 
the First Amendment. But Flynt 
was chosen for a reason . ot 
hccause he i~ "the worst scumbag 
on o.:arth ." hut because he is, quite 
to the contrary, a fairly sympathet -
ic character. Pornography is ~ome­
thi ng that rclat I vely few peoplc 
lind ohjectionahle . When you ~ct: 
this movie , when you think ahout 
il. when you discuss it with your 
frio.:nds, picture I nstead the defcnse 
of aJis or Klansmen rather than 
of a wl~ecraeklng W<)ody 
Harro.:isoll tauntlllg a smug cam:a-
ture of Jerry Fa lwell. Realize then 
what kind of rights are being 
dcfended. Let it leave a had taste 
in your mouth. Be hiller al those 
who would squander our freedoms 
on such garbago.: . 

The important lesson is that the 
Uni ted States is a free country. 
Our rreedom is the foundation of 
our greatness, and this country is 
great enough to allow ror Larry 
Flynts. But we are great in spi te or 
them, not because of them. There 
is no rcason to praise them. any 
more than you would praise a per-
son who shot you, jusl because he 
rou nd you were strong enough to 
survi ve it.

METALLICA

"You pili mil a record ewr)' jil'e years,

. - James Hettield, Metallica lead singer 

For heller or worse , Metallica 
has indeed undergonc drawc 
changes over the year. bUI proved 
at last Salurday's show that fans arc

Those accusations quickly ended alkr 
Metal/ica pummeled the enthusiastic audi -
ence with several classics like "Whiplash," 
"For Whom the Bell Tolls" and the heavy-
metal anthem "Seck and Destroy," Also 
included in the non-stop. two-hour set were 
blistering renditions of their epic "Master of 
Puppets" and ··One." 

Of course the band was obliged 10 perfor.n 
newer material for the audience, but Metall, -
ca chose onl y four lunes from Load, including 
the MTV favorile " Until It Sleeps." Metalli -
ca also gave the audience four from the multi -

platinum Metal/ica aibulll , including "Enter 
Sandman." 

The boys did not seem apologelic for otTer-
ing the newer, "softer" songs to the crowd, yet 
al Ihe same time did nOI insisl on force-feeding 
it 10 Iheir fans. "We've never been out 10 please 
anyone hut ourselves, and the fans tOlally dig

FLYNT: 
Harrelson and Love 
shine in biography 
Continued from Pille 11 
of dollars spent exercisi ng and 
demonstrating this treasured Amer-
ican stronghold, Flynt lost hi wife 
Althea and his ability to walk from 
a ~niper's bu lIet. 

Flynt's roller-coaster saga is 
explored in producer Oliver 
Stone's film biography "The Peo-
ple vs. Larry Flynt," with Woody 
Harrelson and Courtney Love (of 
the band Hole) cast as Larry Flynt 
and Althea Leasure, Flynt's loving 
wife. The fi lm examines Flynt's 
rocky upbringing through hi~ battle 
wHh the U.S. Supreme Court, and 
subsequently examl nes Flynt's 
internal battles with his public 
Image, controversy, love and loss. 

The real -life Larry Flynt makes 
for jui~y, delightfu l eopy - magni-
fied on creen by Harrelson's 
depiction of tbe younger, sleazier 
Flynt , with much of the depths and 

dimensions of the man 's character 
inta'Ct. Harrelson's ponrayal is con-
vincing and shows off the human 
side of one of the most notorious 
American figures in the pa t three 
decades. 

Besides a fascinating and cu ri -
ously multi -dimensional persona, 
"Flynt" is assisted by a strong sup-
porting cast (which includes 
Crispi n Glover as Arlo, an employ-
ee at Hustler). Love's portrayal of 

t\1t~ea is particularly eonvlOcing, 
given the si nger/actress's parallel 
personal struggles with drug abuse 
and rock-star notoriety. 

The bOllom-line selling POint of 
thi s film (if you haven ' t bought all 
the praises showered upon it 
already) is its sense of commonali -
ty. Regardless of the movie-goer 's 
oplOions towards Love, tone or 
Harrelson, "Flynt" reeh of Ilke-
ability and brings out the best in its 
role-players. The same sense of 
commonality can be applied to 
Flynt himself, who becomes as 
admirable as he' ll ever be through 
this film 's ode to hi s cause.

Terror strikes: Biologist Margo Green (Penelope Ann Miller) is terrorized by mystery killer in museum. 

THE RELIC 
Cory thriller entertains, spooks audiences 

By Bill Glanzmann 
Staff Wmer 

In thi 'eason of dull movies. 
~uspense- thrillcr "The Relic" 
comes a~ a breath of fresh air. 
Director Pcter Hyams, known pri -
marily for "Tilllcc fl," head~ thi~ 
fun and efTective - i r often pre-
lhctablc and trite - lilm about a 
ferocious creature that stalks and 
devours various people trapped in 
a museum . 

The story begins a~ a 
researcher in Brazil sends a mys-
terious crate tb the Natural Histo-
ry Museum in Chicago. Promptly. 
a se ries of grisly museum mur-
ders unites the unlikely team of 
biologist Dr. Margo Green (Pene-
lope Ann Miller) and police lieu-
tenant Vincent D' Agosta (Tom 
Sizemore) in a hunt to find the 

killer. 
ontrary to D'Agoslll'S wish-

C , a high-profile celebrity fund -
raiser is held at the mu~eum . After 
a tutal blackout and a security sys-

telll~ hut -down, all who Jrc pre-
sent at the gala soon find them-
selves plunged IOto a nightmare 
world where horror lurks around 
every dark corner. The film falls 
into the fomlulaic trapped-in-a-
haunted-housc scenario as the sur-
vivors are gradually picked off by 
the savage monster. Most of the 
cast arc one-dimensional charac-
ters who are ea ily expendable as 
the creature's next meals. 

Likewise, frequent pseudo-sci-
entific references to DNA, sudden 
evolutionary offsboots and the 
possibility that superstition is real -
ly based on fact are only goofy 

and superficial smokescrecns that 
fail to add depth to the gory center 
of the film. 

Neverthelcs" ''The Relic" is 
cffective within the predictable 
thriller genre. The labyrinthine 
museum provldc~ a convlnclOgly 
gothic and gloomy background 
which supplies ~ufficient suspense 
to provoke scat-jumping from the 
audience as they anticipate the 
creature's next allack. Tight cam-
era shot and the bigger-than-life 
computer-generated images of the 
beast enjoyably inten ify the ter-
ror. 

Although "The Relic" utilizes 
hackneyed and cliche ci nematic 
devices and situations, it is actual -
ly an amusing ride tbrough a 
phantasmagoria of blood and guts 
that has a fast and feverish finale.

WONDERS 
Film documents young 
grade-school virtuosos 

By Jami Lofgreen 
Staff Wnter 

The children of an East Harlt!m 
elementary "'hool are the .,uhjects 
of the documentary film ·'S mall 

Wonder~," where till': 
talent~ of a grade-school 
orchestra are harnessed 
for proud parents hy 
conduc tor Roberta 
Guaspari-Tzavaras. 

Guaspari -Tzavaras ' 
history with the violin 
is not much di fferent 
than Ihat of her pupils. 
As a fourth -g rader she began to 
learn the instrument through a 
school-funded program - her 
working- class background would 
have denied her the opportunity if 
lesson had not been offered 
through public school. 

After obtaining a Masters in 
Music Education. Guaspari -
Tlavaras continued her legacy wi th 
the in trument by purchasing 50 
violin ... in order to t:reate hcr own 
education program for children. 

When her po~iti on at threc 
alterna ti ve East Harlem st: hools 

wa~ ~ Ia~hed due to 1990 hudget 
ClI th, she created a non-profi t 

organi!.ation that would keep her 
\ tring prugram alive. 

··Small Wonder~" charts her 
path or i nSI ructIon from the Ii r ... t 
cncounter~ of element ary-school 

.,tudents with the violin 
to a cc lebrity -a compa-
nied Carnegie Hall con-
ce rt performed hy some 
of her more advanced 
musicians. Isaac tern 
and Itzhak Perlman , 
among others, share the 
stage with the young 
players. 

Guaspari-Tzavaras' dri ve to 
play and teach violin seems inex-
haustihle and contagious - she 
generates so much enthusiasm for 
the instrument among her proteges 
that potential students have to be 
se lected by lottery for her popular 
East-Harlem Violin Program. 

"Small Wonders" offers a con-
vim:ing argument that the arts 
should be an integral part of educa-
tion rather than a privilege for 
I hose who can afford lessons and 
materials. He also affirms the 
notion that we fu lfill our potential 
as hum n bei ngs when we create or 
collahorate in artistic endeavors.

Panthers Poached at Home 
CLAWED: The UCSD women won their second-straight road game, squeez-
ing past Chapman Univer ity, 76-71, and improving to J 0-2 on the season 
By Travis Hill 
Staff Writer 

··Fi nally. a t e~t. I' m ~o happy I" 
How of/en do you hear th o~c 

words (especia lly around campu'»'! 
In the case of th t! 
UCSD women's ba,-
ketball tea m. that 
might have been ex-
actly what the Triton .. 
said ahout coming 
back from an eight-
poi nt deficit and post-
ing a 76-71 victory at 

Chapman niversi ty. Why would 
they ay that 'l ln their la~ t fi\le games. 
the ladies had won their last four 
qui te comfortably, scoring over 100 
poi nt s twice, and were basically in a 
rhythm. Maybe too much of a 
rhythm ; they needed a stiff test to 
sel: how they would respond in a 
closer game. 

Chapman couldn 't ha ve been a 
better challenge. They are one of 
the top teams in the West and the 
Tri tons travelled to their gym in 
Orange, which had over 150 Pan -
ther fans ready to devour the visi -
to rs. 

What they saw could best he 
described as a war. II was a sec-saw 
stru gg le with countl ess lead 
changes, brutally physical play and 
neither side willing to give an inch. 
The Panthers were prepared for the 
Tritons, and it was obvious in their 
play. They went into the locker room 

at the half leading by one, 42-4 1. 
The Panthl!rs con tinued to roar 

mthe ~econd hair. huilding an eight-
pomt lead . In clost! games like th is, 
eight point ~ i~ almost insurmount -

grim. In thl: pa,t. 'ome-from-he-
hl11d vidones havc been difli cult 
for (,SD. But tim time around 
thing~ were dinacnt. 

The Tritons fought back slowly 
but surely behind their two domi-
nant post player ', Karli Jungwi rth 
and nne Westmoreland. They have 
been ruck-solid in the key all season 
long. ThIS game was no different. 
But It could have been . 

Jungwi rth injured her back in the 
first half, and Ihe injury was obvi -
ously painful. But she grilled out the 
rest of the game, and in the process 
had a career performance. She was 
tirebsly rebounding all night, re-
cording 2 I, including II important 
offensive boards. In addition. he 
had 15 points. Westmoreland led all 
scorers with 22 points and went II 
of 19 from the fie ld . She was also 
big on the defensive end, leading all 
players with her four steals. 

But there were other heroes for 
the Tritons. Janessa Bayda, feared 
for her tremendous three-point shot. 
was called upon to play defense on 
the Panthers' best shooter down the 
stretch. Bayda responded. intensi-
fying her pressure and shuttingdown 
her prey. Tristen Teasdale was also

huge in the clutch. In the last minute, 
she had iee waterin herveins,ca lmly 
hitting four free throws to sea l the

Th is was a vcry Important vic-
tory for the Tritons . "We finally

FANS: How the 
leagues were made 
ContInued from page 20 
a story about the ABL in thi 
week's issue. 

However, the ABL face a lot 
orthe same problems that plague 
the U D athletic program: no 
one comes to watch. Despite the 
fantastic stats of many playe rs 
and the drive or those players to 
make this endeavor a success, 
most ga mes have an average at -
tendance rival only to RIMAe. 

Unlike the WNBA, the ABL 
doesn' t have the money or power 
of a 50-year-old basketballtradi -
ti on to keep its head above water, 
and rumor~ are nying that it just 
may drown, especially because the 
league may lose $4 mi Ilion dollars 
after this year. But since Ihe CEO 
of the ABL isn't worrying, then I 
won 't either. 

One poss ibl e pain in th e 
ABL' s side is the WNBA. Al-
though the two schedu les com-

Freshman Eric Wh alen re-

corded a personal best with a 
spirited sw im in the 50-yard 
freesty Ie. 

" I think they responded really 
well," said Boyd. "We had some 
really good wims,'· 

The Tritons do not ha ve a meet 
this coming weekend , hut will 
use the time off to prepare fo r the 
major sWlmml ng event t hey will 
be hosting at Canyo n iew Pool 
the following weekend . 

pliment each other, the WNBA 
docs have the money , power and 
connecti ons of its namesake. 

The W BA will play in large, 
no make that huge, markel ci ties 
like Los Angeles and ew York 
and be televised weekly on Life-
time, ESP and NB C, and keep 
many o rthe rules and regulations 
found in NCAA play. 

The formati ve process forthe 
league is well underway, and the 
W BA may actually be big. 
UCo nn 's Rebecca Lobo has 
promi sed her ervices, as well as 
Sheryl Swoops, but Swoops will 
lake time off of the inaugural 
season to stan her family . 

So maybe the men 's league 
doesn ' t have to deal with mater· 
nity leave, but thi s opportunity 
for women isexciting. Let' s hope 
the rest of the basketball -watch-
ing publie agrees with me. 

And if thi s effort nies, the little 
gi rl s on the playgrounds of 
America can now say, " when I 
grow up, I wanna be a ba ketball

game, pulling down 22 board~ 
and rack i ng up 14 a!>si ~ t ~ or

So where can basketball

the American Baskethall 
League, and coming ~oon to a

Before now, a woman\

sIOnal opportunlll e!> ~()me­
times materialiled overseas, 
along with the opportunity to 
play in the OlympIcs every 
four yearl> , but women wanted 
something more. 

So, the ABL and the 
WNBA were born. Al> we 
l>peak, the ABL il> in full 
swing, and the WNBA is sc t 
to tip-off June 21. 

Both leagues have a 
common .goal of bringing 
women's athletics to a new 
level, but they are going 
about achieving that goal in 
di fferent ways. 

So maybe it isn ' t the dunk-
crazy NBA, but women 's 
basketball captures what 
hoops once was. And if that 
isn't a good enough excuse, 
then I want you to know that 
some of these ladies can 
dunk, too, like Charlotte 
Smith and Sylvia Crawley of 
the ABL and Lisa Leslie of 
the WNBA. 

First, allow me to t II the 
story of the ABL. The league 
consists of eight teams from 
small -market cities 'like 
At lanta, Richmond and 
Seattle, while the season 
parallels the win ter schedule 
of the NBA .

TIme for a breather: Sophomore Jenny Irwin, a five-time All-American and a finalist in last year's 200-yard freestyle, was part of a strong 
women 's squad that dominated Trinity UniverSity (TX) and Claremont College by scores of 151-68 and 150-81 , respectively. 

Tritons Gang up on Tigers 
DOWNPOUR: Swimming in rain, the UCSD women demolish~d Trinity and Claremont in a recent meet 
By Adria McClain 
Staff w" r 

Rain or shine, the meet mu t go 
on. 

This past Sunday the Tritons 
ventured to Claremont to take on 
Claremon t College and Trinity 
College of Texas. It rained heavily 
from the team 's arrival in 

laremont well into the meet. Nev-
ertheless. the contest took place as 
scheduled , and the Tnton~ f;lIred 
well in several events . 

"It 's tough to have a mcet rained 
out.. . we would have swam it any -
way. Onl lightning would have 
cancelled it ," Triton Head (lach 
Doug Boyd explained . 

The event was structured into 
two dual meets each for both the 
women's and the men 's teams. De-

~pite the unfavorable conditions, 
the CSD women overpow-
ered Claremont, 150-8 1, and 
Trinity,151-68 . Themen,a 
team consisting of only 12 
SWimmers, ~plittheir meets 
hy beating Trinity, 120-89, 
but falling to laremont , 
110-101. 

"I t was not ideal condi-
tions," Boyd said . " We' re lucky 
that It wa~n't Windy . At least the 
nll n was coming strai gh t dow n 
Instead of comi ng in to the Side 
like it can sometimes." 

Before the meet , the Tritons 
huddled together and promised not 
to let the miserable weather he-
come an issue. Each swimmer 

vowed to look past the 
heavy. gray curtain of rain 
and perform at hi s or her 
full potential. 

"We kind of sat down 
before Ithe meet I and sa id 
' Let' s not let thi~ affect 
us, n, Boyd added. 

Just as they had hoped, 
the bad weather was not a fa ctor. 
There were numerous good per-
formances for the Tritons. 

All -American ' hawna Cabal-
lero excelled in the 50- and 100-

yard freestyles while teammate 
Linda Monroe won the 200-yard 
hreastroke and 200-yard individual 
medley events. Allison Leppke and 
Keri Wilson placed well in the 
1000-yard freestyle while Rebecca 
Rabe, Jen Poole and Chri~tine 
Tognoli all showed strongly in the 
200-yard backstroke. 

Kelly Byrne raced to victory in 
the 200-yard freestyle and Jaime 
Rubino outdistanced the competi -
ti on in the SaO-yard freestyle and 
the 200-yard tly .

By Sean Rahlml 
Sports Editor 

For most soccer fans in San 
Diego, the hest chance they have 
to witness quality soccer i to at -
tend U SD contests . Both the 
men 's and women 's programs have 
a history of exce llence, with hoth 
squads having won three national 
championship each in the last 10 
years. But every year. for the past 
four 

But beginning on Friday, San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium will be 

host to a four-team, six-game inter-
national soccer tournament to be 
held Jan. 17-22 in San Diego and 
Pasadena. This tourney, known as 
U.. up '97, is a tunc-up for the 
follr national teams participating 
( .S., Mexico, Denmark and Peru) 
and a chance for the squads to fine-
tunc their game in time for the 1998 
World Cup qualifying round. 

Of the four teams, MeXICO has 
heen practicing at U SO, and is 
currently 'cheduled to prac tice for 
the last time today from 10 to 11 :)0 

a.m. The U.S. team IS practicing at 
the AR 0 Training center in Chula 
Vista. 

Yesterday, U.S . ationalTeam 
Head oach Steve Sampson an-
nounced that Alexi Lalas and obi 
Jones have been added to the 
squad,joinlng former La Jolla No-
mad Jovan Kirovski who led hi s 
youth team to the Dallas up in 
1990. 

Commenting on the lack o f 
Amencan fan support In tourna-
ments like thi l> (o ften the national 

team plays in U.S. stadiums that arc 
largely occupied by the rival team \ 
fans) Sampson explained: 

" It has alway been [like thi s!." 
ampson said. "We can always fill 

stadiums if we brought [the Mexi-
can team to play against!, but for u~ 
to get the Anglo community out , we 
need to publicize and adverti~e 
months in advance. 

But I think it is getting beller and 
by having quality tournaments like 
this, we are doing something to 1111-
