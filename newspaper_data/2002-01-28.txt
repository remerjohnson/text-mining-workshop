Feminist fair seeks to 
broaden movement's goals 
Organizations 
work to defy 
stereotypes 
By CARLAN WENDLER 
Staff Writer 

The Feminist Majority 
Leadership Association spon-
sored a fair to inform students 
about feminism and gender 
equality issues Jan. 24 on 
Library Walk. 

"We want to break down the 
stereotypes [of feminists) and 
get people to identify them-
selves as feminists who wouid 
otherwise not,'" said FMLA 
President Corinne Hart.

Protedion: Members of Vox distribute free condoms while educating the 
students about different methods of birth control during Thursday's fair. 

The FMLA invited organiza-
tions and individuals associated 
with women's issues to staff 
tables during the fair. 

More than a dozen groups 
attended the event, including 
the Susan G. Komen Breast 
Cancer Center, Vox and the 
Womyn of Color Conference 
Committee. 

Student response to the fair 
varied, but most attendees 
showed distanced support. 

"I don 't feel that I'm treated 

unequally on campus," said 
Muir sophomore Alison 
Shimasaki. " But I think [the 
fair) is a good thing to have 
there and available." 

Members of the FMLA 
spoke about concerns such as 
feminism in dating relationships 
and retaining femininity while 
being a feminist . 

A presentation about women 
in Afghanistan garnered the 
greatest audience. 

Sian Hilliard gave a brief talk 

about the United States' 
responsibility to the women 
oppressed by the Taliban. One 
of the organizations present at 
the eve nt, Students Against 
Gender Apartheid, dedicates 
itself primarily to supporting 
these women via the 
Revolutionary Association of 
Women in Afghanistan.

Changing Face of Feminism," is

Dodge vetoes Koala trip funds 
Legitimacy of humor publication conference doubted

No money: George Liddle, editor 
of the Koala said lie was 
disappointed with Dodge's veto. 

By MARGARET O'NEILL 
Senior Staff Writer 

A.S. President Jeff Dodge used a 
presidential veto Jan. 18 to deny 
controversial humor publication 
The Koala funding for what editor 
George Liddle said was a confer-
ence in Northern California. It is 
the first time Dodge has used such 
a veto. 

The A.S . Council allocated 
$400 for the trip, wi th equal 
amounts for transportation and 
lodging. After much debate, th& 
council passed the funding request 
10-5-5 at its Jan. 16 meeting. 

After being denied A.S. funding, 
however, members of The Koala did

not make the trip. 
"We're kind of unhappy, but 

what are you going to do about it?" 
Liddle said. 

The debate started because The 
Koala had not received a Student 
Organizations and Leadership 
Opportunities adviser's signature 
on the conference funding request. 
It was later discovered that no such 
requirement exists in the financial 
bylaws. 

"They did not receive their 
S.O.L.O. adviser signature and I 
personally had concerns over the 
very legitimacy of their event," 
Dodge said.

Student fees may 
be raised to pay 
for wage increase 
Budget forces university to 
make tough decisions with 
faculty and staff salaries 
By CLAIRE J. VANNETTE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Student fees may rise to provide 
UC faculty and staff salary increas-
es, this after Gov. Gray Davis' pro-
posed 2002-2003 budget provides 
less funding to the the UC system 
than requested. 

California revenue shortfalls 
prompted Davis to reduce the bud-
get. Nearly all state-funded pro-
grams were affected, and the UC 
system was no exception. 

The universi ty requested $125 
million to fund a 2 percent across-
the-board cost-of-living sa lary 
increase for faculty and staff, and an 
additional 2 percent for parity 
adjusnnents to bring salaries to 
more competitive levels in areas 
where UC salaries lag behind the 
market. . 

Davis' proposed budget, on the 
othe~ hand, allocates $47.6 million 
dollars for a 1.5 percent merit 
increase and no money for other 
increases. 

Sandy Harrison, assistant direc-
tor of California's department of 
finance, cited "a huge problem with 
revenues falling shorter than we 

had anticipated" as the reason for 
the smaller budget 

Harrison said that in forging the 
budget, the state looked to save in 
areas of new or increased spending 
rather than cutting from existing 
programs. Harrison also noted that 
cost-of-living adjustments were 
suspended for many other state 
workers. 

Davis and UC President 
Richard C. Atkinson have an agree-
ment called the partnership for 
Higher Education, which guaran-
tees certain funds for the university. 
This is the second consecutive ye~r 
that partnership funds have not 
been provided in full. 

"The funding we get under the 
partnership ... is the core drive for 
compensation systemwide," said 
UC spokesman Paul Schwartz. 
"Every year we don't get full part-
nership funding, we fall farther and 
farther behind." 

Atkinson is thankful that budget 
cuts were not deeper, but has made 
clear his desire for more funding 
for salary increases. 

"Our faculty and staff are the

UCSD receives record 
number of applications 
This year UCLA was the-only UC 
school to receive more applications 
By RAY HENGST 
Staff Writer 

UCSD received a record 48,771 
fall quarter applications this year, 8 
percent more than last year accord-
ing to a preliminary Jan. 10 report 
from . Student Research and 
Information. 

Freshman applications rose 7.6 
percent from 38,137 to 41,037 and 
transfer applications rose 10.6 per-
cent from 6,990 to 7,734. This is 
the third consecutive year that 
UCSD has received a record-set-
ting number of applications. 

"[The current application num-
bers) are fairly accurate ... there will 
be some changes," said acting 
Assistant Vice Chancellor for 
Enrollment and Management Mae 
Brown. "We will not know final 
enrollment numbers until the third 

week of fall quarter." 
Brown said that about 17,000 

fres hman applicants and 4,600 
transfer applicants would be admit-
ted, which would be enough to 
enroll 4,100 freshmen and 1,340 
transfer students. 

UCSD received the second 
most freshman applications in the 
UC system behind UCLA, accord-
ing to Brown. 

"Where I see us needing to 
focus is what we can do to increase 
the attractiveness of UCSD after 
we've made the offer of admission," 
Brown said. "Recruitnlent isn't the 
problem for us ... it's yield." 

Brown said that there were 
"gains in applications from histori -
cally underrepresented students." 

More minority students applied

Applications: 
Warren College was most 
popular among applicants 
Continued from page 1 
this year, but proportionately there 
has been little change in the amount 
of minority applicants. 

The number of African-American 
applicants increased 9.9 percent this 
year, Mexican-American applicants 
increased 10 percent, Filipino appli-
cants increased 7.3 percent, Latino 
applicants increased 13.6 percent and 
Native American applicants increased 
16.2 percent. 

In terms of the amount of minori -
ty applicants compared to the whole 
pool of applicants, no minority group 
logged more than a 0.2 percent 
IIlcrease. 

Caucasian applicants make up 37.4 
percent of the total, as compared ro 
37 percent last year. The two other 
groups with the largest comparative 
increase are Filipinos, who make up 
3.2 percent of the total applicants 
compared ro 3 percent last year, and 
Mexican-Americans, who make up 
9.5 percent of the total applicants 
compared to 9.3 percent last year. 

"We do active recruitment in the 
fall for all students," Brown said. "In 
our outreach efforts we talk about 
UCSD and the strength of this cam-
pus in terms of its academic pro-
grams." 

Earl Warren College received the 
most freshman a pplications this year, 
with 2(H percent of the total, fol-
lowed by Muir with 19.8 percent, 
RC\'ellc with 15.9 percent, Roosevelt 
with 12.8 percent, Marfuall with Il.l 
percent and Sixth College with 9.8 
percent. Muir received the most 
transfer applications, followed by 
\Varren, Marshall, Roosevelt and 
Revelle. 

U\Ye have met our goal in numbers 
of applications," said Sixth College 
DCln of Academic Advising Sandra 
\ Villiams. "We have received enough 
applications to easi ly meet our target 
of 330 freshmen for fall 2002." 

Revelle i satisfied with the num-
ber of applications received from 
prospective freshmen, acting Revelle 
Provost Barbara Sawrey said. 

Revelle wants to receive more 
transfer applications, Sawrey added. 

" We work particularly hard to 
recru it transfer students and to 
inform them of the options avai lable 
if they come to Revelle," Sawrey said. 
"Possibl y, some of the sa me StruC-
tured (general educa tion] require-
ments that freshmen like are a deter-
rent [Q an upper-division student 
cOllling fTom a community college." 

UCSD is seeking to increase the 
number of applicants from California 
community colleges, according to 
Brown. 

"We think that a number of the 
programs and activIties we've 
launched over the last few years are 
beginning to produce significant 
effects at the transfer level," Brown 
said. 

Brown noted that UCSD had a 63 
percent admit rare for transfer stu-
dents last year, compared to a 43 per-
cent admit rate for freshman appli-
cants. 

Several students mentioned their 
college's general education require-
ments and college layout as the main 
reason for choosing their college. 

Warren freshman Olivia Bentley 
said that she wavered between two 
colleges before deciding on Warren 
because of its general education 
requirements. 

"I like Warren s overall looks," 
Bentley said. "1 really like the dorms,

Marshall sophomore Marvin

"I rea lly like ... the way

Roosevelt sophomore Lucia Mortiz

Muir fee referendum to be voted on this week 

Students at John Muir College vote this week on 
a fee referendum to raise the Muir student activity 
fee. If passed, the quarterly activity fee collected 
from students will increase to $1, from $2. The Muir 
College Council would distribute the funds for 
events, organizations and activities. 

Polling stations will be set up outside Middle of 
Muir between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. from Jan. 28 
through Feb. 1. 

There will also be a polling booth at Muir 
College's semiformal dance to be held on Feb. 1. 
The referendum is being sponsored by the Muir 
College Council. 

UCSD prepares to help 
disadvantaged schoofs 

UCSD recently strengthened its partnership with 
local Native American communities and educational 
outreach programs. 

The university recelved a $1.4 mi llion grant to 
enhance academic achievement and college atten-
dance rates for students at two schools In north-
eastem San Diego County. 

Undergraduate students from UCSD will be able 
to tutor students at Pauma Elementary School and 
Valley Center Hi~h School because of funds provid· 
ed by the GroWing Early Awareness and Readiness 
for Undergraduate Program. 

UCSD students will assist students in all grade 
levels via a live video feed carned over the Intemet 
Intemet technology is being used because the dis-
tance between tile two campuses was previously 
too far for tutors to commute. The high-speed 
broadband system connecting the school IS part of 
the Tribal Digital Village project 

Tutors will interact with the schools, which serve 
largely American Indian and Mexican·American com-
munities, from a new Outreach Communications 
Center at UCSD. 

The grant is in addition to ongoing partnerships 
among the Pala, Pauma and Rincon bands of 
Luiseno Mission Indians 

Student progress will be tracked as they move 
from kindergarten through high school. The grant 
also provides computer training for adults and home 
visits to parents. 

UCSD also participates in G.EAR U.P. programs 
with Gompers Secondary School Horace Mann 

Middle School in San Diego and National City 
Middle School in National City. UCSD's Student 
Educational Advancement office will administer the 
G.EAR. U.P. grant, which is sponsored by the u.s. 
Department of Education. 

Biologists closer to verifying 
50-year hypothesis on cells 

Embryo-development research perfonned on 
fruit flies at UCSD may prove a mathematician's 50-
year old hypothesis on cell development in humans. 

UCSD biologists have observed a protein gradi-
ent in fruit fly embryos that leads to the changes in 
the nervous system and to other developmental 
changes. 

In the 1950s, mathematician Alan Turing pro-
posed that chemicals created in small amounts du r-
Ing the development of organisms may cause the 
cells to differentiate and lead to developmental 
changes. Such changes dictate the physical look of 
organisms and the placement of organs. 
Morphogens, the chemicals causing such changes, 
have been linked to the proteins observed by the 
researchers. . 

UCSD professor of biology Ethan Beir headed 
the research, which is featured in this month's edi-
tion of the joumal Developmental Cell.

MONDAY, JANUARY 28, 2002 

basically 

Just when I thought the ghetto of Beverly Hills couldn't get any 
sleepier, a drug lord 
popped into the lime-
light. 

And wouldn't you just know it'd 
be my father. 

Yes, watch your step, for I am the 
daughter of one of the most 
renowned drug dealers in Southern 
California. At least, that was the 
stance of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 

One night several years ago, I 
found myself staring at the clock at 
1: 15 a.m. Because I had an actual 
"bedtime" of 10 p.m. until the day I 
left for college (my father is a very 
rtriet druggie - go figure), I was mp-
posrd to be asleep. 

However, it's kind of hard to 
sleep when the sound of the door-
bell, accompanied by very loud male 
voices in the living room, wake you 
up, 

Now, normally, I would do what 
any well-trained teen-ager would do: 
lie in bed and seethe, and then dish 
our a nice plate of sass in the morn-
ing. I could hear the smart-ass 

• remarks already ... "Well I would go 
to school, Dad, but romtO,U was mak-
ing so much noise last night that I 
couldn't sleep, and I really feel that I 
need a nice relaxing day in bed no~." 
Ahh, it would be sweet. 

But that night, for some reason , I 
couldn't wait until morning , My 
father needed a good excuse for 
making that much noise, and even if 
he had one, I was going to ignore it

THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

Don't quash gooey affection sessions 
San Diegans should get out, exercise honnonal prerogatives 
By SIMONE SANTINI 
Senior Staff Writer 

J recently took a brief vacation 
in Mexico City. The visit allowed 
me to remark on differences 
between Mexican and American 
social mores that seemed to emerge 
in an unfamiliar environment. 

One thing I noticed was the 
large number of couples kissing 
every which way - a sight to 
which I had grown very accus-
tomed during my adolescence in 
Italy, but as I now live in San 
Diego it is a sight rare enough to 
catch my eye when I see it. 

Every park bench, little wall and 
piece oflawn was filled with people 
tightly connected by the tongue, 
with hands touching places that 
nobody would dare to touch on 
American television and unspeak-
able body parts brushing against 
each other. Scenes like this are 
quite common in Latin countries. 

I remember seeing a couple in 
Naples, Italy, decide in the middle of 
a busy boulevard that it was a good 
time to kiss. They stopped the car in 
the middle of the lane and did things 
that, in the United States, would 
garner at least a PG-13 rating. 

The decision was criticizable 
from a traffic circulation viewpoint 
- traffic is very bad in Naples to 
begin with - but heartwanning 
otherwise. 

This explosion of the senses 
always appeared to me very beauti-
ful and very natural. We are, after 
all, talking about guys and girls in 
the middle of adolescence, with 
hormones raging and all that, 

Why aren't displays of this kind 
seen in San Diego? All external 
c.ircumstances would conspire to 
bring lovers together: the mild 

weather, the beach, the parks ... 
what happened to San Diego's 
lovers? 

Since n:lture sends its calls 
across boundaries to hormones of 
all countries, it seems logical to 
assume that the behavioral differ-
ences between San Diego 
teenagers and their Latin counter-
parts are cui tural. 

There are indeed two streaks of 
Anlerican culture that could explain 
this restrained attitude. On the one 
hand, American culture places a 
very high value on privacy - not 
only in the sense of protection from 
undue intrusion, 

in newly built areas, walking areas 
are restricted to privately owned 
shopping malls and, as such, are 
subject to the primacy of con-
sumption over socialization. 
Suburban areas are the triumph of 
private land over public spaces. 

This lack of public life should be 
added to the well-planted myth of 
self-reliance, which is on a collision 
course with displays of affection: 
Displaying affection entails admit-
ting a break in self-reliance, a need. 
It entails admitting that one cannot 
do by himself, but needs an emo-
tional complement, and kissing or 

caressing on the 
but also in the cre-
ation of almost 
impenetrable barri-
ers between one's 
private lives and 
one's public life, 

Americans are 
not fond of dis-
playing their pri-
vate life in public 
places, but thei r 
Latin counterparts 
do not seem to 
have a problem 
with it. The idiom 
"public display of 
affection" doesn't

street means 
admitting this 
publicly. 

I believe that it 
is this belief of vul-
nerability that 
makes displays of 
affection hard, 
especially for men. 
Men have been 
assigned the gen-
der role of lonely 
heroes who do not 
need anybody. At 
the end of the 
movie, the 

even have an equivalent in Latin 
languages - the practice doesn't 
constitute a problem. 

One can trace the evolution of 
this attitude in American culture 
through a survey of structural 
development - tracing the pro-
gressive reduction and eventual 
elimination of public areas of 
soc.ial aggregation in the cities. 

Most East Coast cities still have 
plazas and streets designed for 
strolling and socializing. On most 
of the West Coast, and especially 

Western hero has 
to depart alone, leaving broken 
hearts behind, but never giving up 
his freedom. This well-ingrained 
mechanism makes it almost shame-
ful for a man to be affectionate. 

To this, we should add a second 
streak of American culture: its 
essentially Puritan origin, with the 
well-known repression of public 
sexual discourse th2.t comes with it. 
The influence of this point is so 
powerful that even curious ideas, 
such as the fac:t that schools 
shouldn't teach sexual education to 

Join your fr iends at 
Round Table Pizza for 

children, have an almost axiomatic 
acceptance. 

The same attitude prevents 
public sexual manifestations unless 
they take place in a strictly coded 
way. The display of scantily 
dressed women to advertise a 
product is well-accepted, The 
extreme situation in which these 
displays take place - on remote 
beaches, with women conforming 
so well to the accepted canons that 
they look almost abstract - keeps 
the display of sexuali ty removed 
from the sphere of everyday life. 

In a sense, the women dis-
played in the sexually charged dis-
play that one sees on TV are not 
human beings, but sexual prod-
ucts. We know that American cul-
ture is accustomed to the role of 
products in society. 

[t would be much less accepted 
if normal people, apart from any 
at:t of consumption, displayed sex-
ual behavior in public, 

The force preventing people 
from freely showing their affection 
is powerful: a cultural heritage dat-
ing back hundreds of years. The 
only defense in these cases is to set 
the right example in an open and 
forceful manner, Fortunately, 
UCSD is full of young people with 
the right level of hormones for 
such an operation. 

My invitation to them is: Start 
kissing. Take your favorite public 
spot on campus and sta rt kissing 
your girlfriend or boyfriend. 
Touch each other, walk around 
campus embracing so tightly that 
there will be no light between your 
bodies. Start necking in the Price 
Center and on Library Walk. 
Learn that it is pleasant to show 
the world that you love to stay 
together.

Well, needless to say, it kind of 
threw off my rhythm when I 
sashayed into the hallway and saw 
two cops standing there. 

At that point, I figured it was not 
the time to be a typical teen-ager. I 
mean, I wasn't sllre if extreme peski-
ness was a misdemeanor. You will all 
be happy to know that it's not. 

Anyway, the cops hadn't seen me 
yet. They were still interrogating my 
father, saying typical cop stuff such 
as, "Sir, this would go a lot smoother 
if you would just be srraight wi til us," 
and, "We saw the suspect at your 
door, so stop acting like you don't 
know what we're talking about." 

Wel l, my jaw must have made a 
preny loud thud when it hit the 
floor, becausc all three men turned 
and saw me. 

So now these men of the law 
were staring at me in my pajamas, 
which consisted of sweat pants and a 
tent-sized T-shirt that' probably 
could have single-handedly saved the 
entire Midwest from flooding. 

Cop (turning to my father very 
critically): "Sir, is that your wife?" 

Dad (horrified that anyone would 
think he was married to a l6-year-
old): "No! That is my duughtcr." 

Now these cops were in rrouble. 
You ean accuse my dad of being a 
drug lord, but nobody calls Arnold 
Sklar a pedophile. 

So my father and the cops were

the students can trust their elected

vice presidents certainly did not 
campaign on such vicious, anti-
American quotes. Perhaps they feel 
that being a crafty politician entails 
lying to their constituents. 

Once this is published, the A.S. 
Council members will probably 
release some sort of statement skew-
ing the realities of their lies. They 

engaged in a glaring contest, which, 
in my expert opinion, is no way to 
stay out of jail. Luckily for him, my 
father turned to look at me. 

Dad (not in the mood for the 
Bitch Express): "Carrie, go to bed. 
Now." 

You don 't have to tell me twice to 
obey my father. I was going to go to 
bed. Well, I was going to go around 
the corner and eavesdrop; close 
enough. 

By now - what with the Statuto-
ry rape accusations and all - there 
had been enough commotion to 
wake my mother. She came down-
stairs, none too pleased to be awake, 
and even less pleased to discover 
policemen in her living room. 

Mom (full of feminine compo-
sure): "What the hell is going on 
here?" 

Dad (relieved to see someone he 
is actually married to): "These men 
think they rracked a well-known 
drug dealer to our door, where he 
apparently 'made a deal' ,vith some-
one in this house." 

Well, that cleared that up. 
This is the time when all house-

wives shine. It was one of those rare 
moments when the house, their 
domain of power and authority, is in 
complete disarray, and the wife must 
step up and take charge before the 
world as she knows it comes crashing 
down. 

Luckily, my mother was up to the 
challenge. 

Mom (up to the challenge): "I'm 
going to the bathroom." 

Whew! We're saved. That should 
solve everything, Thanks, Mom. 

Of course, the cops wouldn't have 
that particular plan. 

Cop (getting up to block my 
mothers path): "Ma'am, I can't let

you do that." 
Great, now he was in rrouble. It's 

one thing to tell my dad hes a drug 
lord with a taste for the young ones, 
but it is quite another to keep my 
mother out of the bathroom. No 
one, not even Fidel Casrro in his 
finest hour, can keep a Sklar woman 
from peeing. This officer is toast. He 
is vapor. So long, sucker. 

Mom (oying to decide how best 
to kill him): "Why not?" 

Other cop (sensing danger -
smart man): "It's policy, ma'am. In 
cases such as these, its common for 
suspects to ... er ... flush evidence." 

Well my mom wasn't going to 
take that Not from Casrro, and cer-
tainly nor from this cop. 

Mom (not taking it): "And just 
what makes you think we have drugs 
here?" 

Cop (physically taken aback by 
her sass - go Mom!): "We were 
staked out on the corner and saw the 
drug dealer pull into a driveway with 
a white sport utility vehicle. He went 
lip to the door, and - " 

Mom (cool beyond words): "You •

door?" 

Cop:

makes you her bitch, you don't do

YOli can guess what happened 
next. The cops got on the radio, 
called the station to infonn them 
that they were retarded, and went 
next door to interrogate our neigh-
bors, who definitely like to party 
from time to time. 

So basica lly, my dad isn't a drug

But he bought property next to one,

Feminism: 
Two dozen booths attract 
students on Library walk 
Continued from page 1 

represented in the membership of the 
FMLA, which includes two men. 

One is Gene Larsen-Hallock, a transfer 
stud ent. Like many other members or the 
FMLA, he grew up in a home that support-
ed feminist policy. When presented with 
the opportunity to join a formal feminist 
organization upon arrival at UCSD this ' 
year, Larsen-Hallock took the chance. 

"It's not really weird," he said in refer-
ence to being a male feminist. "At its core, 
feminism is about equality. It's not about 
elevating one gender over another." 

According to Harr, the FMLA hopes to 
build on that understanding and get "people 
to identify as feminists and not be afraid of 
the word." 

Organizers scheduled the fair to coincide 
with the anniversary of the Supreme Court's 
Roe v. Wade decision in 1973. 

"The biggest national issue is the abor-
tion issue because we have a conservative 
presidcnt who can appoint conservative jus-
tices," said Hart when asked about the 
direction of American feminism. 

Though feminism is most often associat-
ed with being pro-choice on abortion, that 
was not the onl y opinion represented 
Thursday. 

In a separate event Thursday night, the 
Catholic Community at UCSD sponsored a 
lecture - "The Feminist Case For Life"-
given by Michaelene Jenkins. 

Idea exchange: Muir student Emily Chee (right) 
speaks with a fair organizer at Thursday's event. 

"Most people today are feminists; they 
just don't know it because they see feminism 
tied to radicalism," FMLA member Katie 
Jacquct said. "We view it as a philosophy of 
human rights." 

Whether most students agree with that 
appraisal is unclear. 

"I don't think it's as much of an issue," 
said Marshall Junior Margaret Ling. "If 

Students at the fair could find positions 
more moderate among the organizations 
represented there. T he Women's Resource 
Committee, while not identifying itself 
explicitly with the pro-life camp, showed its 
position in a statement: "We look at women 
holistically and try to educate them about 
their options and the many negative side 
effects of abortion." 

anything, 1 feel more oppressed bccause of l~iiiiiiE:::~~ 
my race. " 

Despite the disparate political positions 
held by FMLA leadership and the invited 
groups, a sense of cooperation pervaded the 
afternoon. 

Diversity and affirmative action were 
cited by Hart as issues of primary impor-
tance for feminists at UCSD. 

"Part of the feminist platform is to pro-
mote diversity as given by the national 
organization [the Feminist Majority 
Foundation)," Hart said.

view of what a conference actually 
is.

"We have been working very 
hard to bring our salaries to parity 
with the Compo Eight," Navrides 
said. The Compo Eight is an index 
of eight universities comparable 
to UCSD. 

Economics professor and chair

"One year's delay in bringing

He also said, however, that salary

the University of California. 

"In order to attract capable

Starr said. "Good people don't

salary increases will hurt recruit-
ing and retention, and will also 
put the university at a "disadvan-
tage." 

Atkinson emphasized his com-
mitment to seeking further raises 
in a UCOP press release, stating, 
"We will continue to seek addi-
tional salary funds as the state 
finances allow." 

The UC Board of Regents 
plans to lobby the California leg-
islature for increased funding in 
March when the regents will 
attend UC Day, an event that 
brings members of th,e UC com-
munity together with legislators 
to discuss issues relevant to the 
universi ty. 

The regents will follow UC 
Vice President for Budget Larry 
Hershman's advice and ask legisla-
tors to revise the budget to pro-

vide a 0.5 percent salary increase 
for all faculty and staff in addition 
to the 1.5 percent merit increase 
already in the budget, according 
to UC Regent Velma Montoya. 

Montoya called the increase 
"our Srst priority." 

Lobbying for adjustments 
under such a tight budget, howev-
er, may be difficult. 

"Adding something means 
removing something else," 
Harrison said . "It's generally a 
zero-sum game and the legislators 
have to priori tiu." 

In the absence of more money 
through the state budget, the uni-
versity would have to seek funds 
elsewhere. 

'Rais ing student 
fee s is not ou r 

preference because 
it necessarily 

impacts 
accessibility .. : . 

-Paul Schwartz 
UC spokesman 

The regents also discussed 
raising money through increased 
student fees at their last meeting. 
Regents Ward Connerly and John 
Davies suggested the idea, 
Montoya said. 

Connerly and Davies were 
unavailable for comment, and tile 
official minutes from the meeting 
have not yet been released. 

Such a measure is not the uni-
versity's first choice, according to 
Schwartz. 

"Raising student fees is not our 
preference because it necessarily 
impacts accessibility and because 
we believe full partnership fund-
ing for salaries is the proper rem-
edy," Schwartz said. "Increasing 
salaries while keeping [the 
University of California] afford-
able are both high priorities of 
ours." 

MONDAY, JANUARY 28, 2002 

Student regent Tracy Davis 
said such proposals are not unusu-
al. 

She said the topic of raising 
student fees "comes up every year 
around budget time, but it comes 
up more strongly in times of 
financial crisis." 

She also emphasized that the 
discussion was "conversational ," 
and not necessarily indicative of 
how regents would vote should 
the issue reach that stage. 

Davis said she was the only 
regent to specifically speak out 
against the prospect of increasing 
student fees to fund the salary 
increases at the regents meeting. 

She said that while student fees 
have remained level for the last 
seven years, the cost of housing 
and other living expenses in 
California have risen. 

"The total cost of attending 
[the University of California] has 
increased although tuition has 
stayed the same," she said. 

Montoya also opposes 
increased fees, saying she thinks 
growing numbers of students, 
especially those in the middle 
class, are being "priced out" of a 
UC education. 

Revelle junior Vanita Patel 
advocates gleaning the money for 
salary increases from other budget 
cuts, and said the university 
should look to cut excess staff or 
funding before passing the cost 
onto students. . 

However, Patel added that she 
might be open to the idea of fee 
increases in cases of dire need . 

"If it's for a really good cause 
-- something where the money 
ca n't come from anywhere else -
then it's justified," she said. 

Schwartz is confident that Stu-
dent fee increases will not be nec-
essary. 

"It's doubtful that the legisla-
ture and governor would really 
raise student fees in order to boost 
salaries," he said.

THE FUTURE OF 
UCSD'S DIVERSITY 

IS IN THE HANDS OF 
THOSE W ITH DIFFERENT 

VIEW POINTS AND 
MANY STRATEGIES 

" 

," Q~ TH REfS 

BY JENNIFER EASTERDAY, 
STAFF WRITER 

With the 1999 creation of the Chancellor's Diversi ty Council and efforts to admit more minority students, 
it appears everyone is ~orking to increase diversity at 
UCSD. 

However, the issue poses many questions. 
What does "diversity" really mean and why is it impo r-

tant? Are the changes being made to increase it actually 
working and are they even needed' Whose responsibility is 
it to address these questions ' 

Ask students, faculty and staff and you 'll get di ffe rent 
answers to each of these questions. 

UCSD Chancellor Robert C. Dynes stresses th e 
importance of on-campus diversity - ethnic, racial and 
otherwise - because it fosters the type of strength that he 
says comes "from people that aren 't part of th e 
Establishment asking questions that the Establishment 
won't ask," and from people "bringing their own culture 
and their own wealth of ideas, wealth of perspectives 
together." 

He continued, "The strength comes when we all learn -
we don't have to agree with everybody - but the strength 
comes when people begin to appreciate and respect differ-
ent views." 

Dynes said racial diversity is not the only key to achiev-
ing this strength; benefits also arise from "diversity in the 
broadest sense." 

Some feel it is the school's responsibility to provide 
UCSD students with an education that includes diversity. 

"If we are graduating students who have no background 
and understanding of diversity, community and multi cultur-
al issues, we are not meeting our responsibilities as an insti -
tution of higher education," said Edwina Welch, director of 
the Cross-Cultural Center. 

On the other hand, UCSD Conservative Union Vice 
Chairman John Allison says diversity is important at a uni-
versity, but that making it "morc important than academic 
excellence" compromises that excellence. 

Ethnic studies professor George Lipsitz feels that such a 
view is detrimental to diversity at UCSD. 

"The toughest thing is for people to see this as a mat-
ter of academic and intellectual excellence rath er than 
reparations for other forms of social inequali ty," Lipsitz 
said. 

He also said that many people see the effort to increase 
diversity on campus as "an act of chari ty, but it's a matter of 
self-interest for our own selves because good scholarly con-
versation draws on the widest pool of voices." 

Lipsitz said he thinks there are several problems with 
current admission procedures, which he says help rein force 
a lack of diversity at UCSD and give rewards to already 
privileged students.

Future: 
Some argue that current 
system is adequate 
Continued from page 11 

T he policies and efforts of the 
Chancellor's Diversi ty C ouncil, 
Lipsitz said, are "well -intentioned 
but not likely to succeed. I don't 
th1l1k they're serious ly going to 
change the climate on campus." 

So wha t needs to be changed to 
make tangible differences in 
UCSD's diversity) 

According to Revelle junior 
:\ dam Richards, nothing. 

"I do not believe that changes 
need to be made to the ethnic and 
r:lciaI diversity of UCS D," 
Richards said . 

"Though change would certain-
ly be beneficial fo r all , th is change 
'hould not be a resul t of a mandate 
or regulation involvi ng quotas," he 
continued. "If more tudents are 
admi ned that ha ppen to fit into 
underrepresented groups here at 

CSD based on current admission 
policies, fa ntastic. However, delib-
era te changes in admission policy 
to promote this diversificati on by 
alloca ting quotas arc unfair and 
illegal. " 

H owever, there are many people 
who do feel changes in di ve rsity at 
UCS D are necessary, though they 
do not agree 0 11 what those changes 
should be. 

lvlarshall sophomore J ennifer 
Richter aid any future differences 
in diversi ty wo~d require "people 
bei ng open to see new culmres ... 
and get out of their ethnic rut; peo-
ple being able to feel they are wel-
come to Ido this] no matter what 

race they are." 
Shaun Travers, director of the 

Lesbian, G ay, Bisexual and 
Transgender Association at 
UC SD, seconded the dema nd for 
a change initia ted not by admini s-
trative programs, but by individu-
als. 

"Money can only do so much," 
Travers said. "' ¥hat would be bet-
ter is more of a community." 

Al lison does not think efforts 
being made on campus will affect 
diversity at UCSD. Student orga-
nizations that try to promote edu-
cation about their various cultures 
"do not change the ethnic make-
up of students on campus," he 
said. "The only way the diversity 
on campus can change is if the 
people app lying to school 
change." 

H ow those people applying to 
UCSD are evaluated, however, 
affects who is admitted and ulti -
mately who regi ters. 

According to Lipsi tz, "our 
admi sions policy is the worst in 
the UC system in producing barri-
ers to minority enrollment." H e 
suggested several ways to boost 
enrollment of minority students. 

Instead of admitting the top 10 
percent statewide, admit the top 3 
percent from Impe rial and San 
Diego counties, Lipsitz said. 

He also suggested de-em phasiz-
ing AP courses and adopting a pol-
icy that makes Ns in a high school's 
hardest classes tne top grade. That 
way, students are not being pun-
ished with lower, weighted grade 
point averages for attending a high 
school where few AP courses are 
offered . 

Lipsitz also said UCSD needs to 
ask stud ents how much S.A.T. 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

preparation they had and then 
weight scores accordingly. Students 

. from a more affluent socio-eco-
nomic class, who can take multiple 
preparation classes for the S.A.T., 
are compared directly with students 
from lower-income families who 
may not have had the same level of 
preparation. 

"(The S.A.T.] does not measure 
merit, but measures preparation," 

'If more students are 
admitted that happen 

to fit into 
underrepresented 

groups here at UCSD 
based on current 

admission policies, 
fantast ic. However, 

deliberate changes in 
admission policy to 

promote this 
diversification by 

allocating quotas are 
unfair and illegal : 

Li psi tz said. 

-Adam Richards 
Revelle junior 

Finall y, he wants to see more 
emphasis in hiring new fac ul ty in 
areas where UCS D's curriculum 
has trailed comparable insti tutions, 
areas such as Afri can studi es, 
C hica no studies and Africa n-
American smdies. 

Accordi ng to Dynes, a poli cy 
that has improved the .diversity at 

UCSD is our unique transfer pro-
gram. 

,. If you wan t a di verse set of 
people on campus, you [have to] 
accept that people have di ffe rent 
avenues to get here," he said . "A 
lot of you ng people, for whatever 
reason, would prefer to go to 
community college for two years 

. than to move into residence here 
[as freshmen]. But if you look i1 t 
the pe rformance at graduatio n of 
those that ca me as transfe r stu-
dents compared to those who 
came as freshme n, their GPAs are 
indisti ngui shabl e, which means 
th at we're doing somethi ng 
right." 

Rebalancing the wei ghts g iven 
to numerical fac tors such as G PA 
and S .A. T. scores is not the only 
step some see as important to creat-
ing an admissions policy that 
encourages more e thnic di versi ty. 

UCSD psych ologist L inda 
Youn g, also the director of a peer 
support program, said as well that 
more minority students will be 
admin ed to UCSD by "changing 
admissions criteria ... givi ng weight 
to attributes such as leadership 
skills and experiences, oral commu-
nica tion, interpersonal skill s, per-
sonal responsibility, community 
service an d mul ticultural compe-
tency." 

Some think tha t increased out-
reach programs will help foster 
cOllnections with younger minority 
students and help prepare them for 
college. Young sa id that more fund-
ing is needed to conduct outreach 
and to give greater support to pro-
grams that increase ethnic diversity, 
such as K- 12 outreach programs 
and scholarship funding for under-
represen ted studen ts. 

M ONDAY, JANUARY 28, 2002 

However, there are those who 
fee l that nothing UCSD does will 
increase its racial and ethnic diver-
sity, 

Marshall junior .Lauren Rau 
said, "I don't think UCS D ca n do 
much because I think the problem 
sta rts before people get to col-
lege." 

Dynes acknowledged the limita -
tions faced by anyone seeking to 
increase ethnic diversity in higher 
edu cation. 

"This rea ll y is a long-term 
issue," Dynes said. "T he problems 
are created ... from pre-K all the 
way through. We can 't mrn that 
around overnight. [But] we can 
help, we can dig in, we can go at 
what we think are the key issues." 

For change to take place , how-
ever, someone needs to assume 
responsibili ty. Who that someone 
is depends on who you ta lk to. 

Vi ce Chance llor of Student 
Affairs Joseph Watson said under-
represented students, if concerned, 
will take on some of the responsi -
bility to make UCSD more attrac-
tive, and that t11ese students carry 
obligations. 

But when asked to speak about 
diversity, some srudems hesitate, 
feeling 'they aren't familia r enough 
with the topic to express a valid 
opinion. 

When interviewed, Roosevelt 
senio r Jessica Shpall said, "I don 't 
know if I'm the right person to 
talk to. I don't know much about 
it. " 

Other students simpl y aren't 
concerned. 

"When I go into class, I don't 
really notice what races are in the

MONDAY, JANUARY 28, 2002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Diverse: 
Dynes is self-appointed 
chief diversity officer 
Continued from pace 11 
class. I could really care less: I'm 
concentrating on gening good 
grades," said Muir senior Jetson 
Nguyen. 

Lipsitz believes that ultimately, 
the responsibility of increasing 
diversity at UCSD lies with the fac-
ulty. 

"If the faculty demanded a dif-
ferent admissions process, we'd 
have it," he said. 

Travers, however, said it is the 
responsi bility of 

made, Lipsitz sees linle hope for 
the future of diversity at UCSD, 

"There is little prospect for 
improvement in the future," he 
said. However, he noted that "up 
until now, there hasn't been suffi-
cient will to do it, but that doesn't 
mean it can't be done." 

Most people feel more confi-
dent that UCSD's future will 
include a more diverse campus. 

"I'm optimistic," said African-
American Student Union member 
Sarah Abukar. "With the new open 
admissions policy, we can only 
hope to see a greater number of 
minority students attending the 
school in the future." 

Dynes shares that optimism. 
"The real goal is 

the entire campus. 
He said that when 
every member of 
the faculty, staff 
and student body 
"feels their own 
personal commit-
ment to increase 
diversity, we'll 
improve by leaps 
and bounds." 

In 1999, 
UCSD's adminis-
tration crea ted a 
new position, the 
chief diversity offi-
cer, to oversee 
diversity. Dynes 
filled it himself. 

'The campus will 
gain new ideas, 

perceptions, 
intelligence, 

creativity, culture, 
music and 

interests. In short, 
it will itself 

become more 
well-rounded.' 

to have a commu-
nity on this cam-
pus, and I mean a 
community ... that 
is welcoming to 
any and all differ-
ences, so that you 
can embrace and 
respect differences 
that people bring, 
and celebrate 
them," Dynes said. 
"We're going that 
direction, we're 
just not there yet. If 
I didn't believe we 
could get there, I 
wouldn't push it." 

-David Brown Mitchell 
African-American Student 

Union Also hopeful for 
D y n e s 

explained, "I feel that diversity is 
everybody's job on the campus -
not one person's, not a few people, 
not the administration, not the sm-
dents, not the faculty. It's every-
body's job, and I felt the only way 
to make that statement was to 
appoint mysel f [as chief diversity 
officer). That way, the vice chancel-
lors would be held accountable to 
me for what they were doing on 
diversity on campus." 

In light of so much disagree-
ment about changes t11at need to be 

a future with 
increased diversity, David Brown 
Mitchell, a member of the AASU, 
said that with more diversity, " the 
campus will gain new ideas, percep-
tions, intelligence, creativity, cul-
ture, music and interests. In short, 
it will itself become more well-
rounded." 

Travers shared this sentiment, 
saying that with increased diversity 
UCSD will gain "wisdom ... it will 
be vibrant. There will be energy, 
disagreement and protest ... and 
tha t crcHCS education."

In total, the Tritons lost only 28

This meet signaled the first

"Jasmin [Dao] told me be fore

said. "And then I thought about it 
and realized I haven't played com-
petitively since N ationals last May. 
There is a big difference berween 
practices and ma tches. It was great 
to fina lly play again ." 

UCS D won't ge t another break

Tritons lose 
to ranked 
UCI, UCLA 
Men's volleyball 
overall record 
drops to 0-5 
By ARVIND VASAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD's men's volleyball team 
looked for its first victory of the 
season when it traveled to UC 
Irvine and UC Los Angeles this 
weekend. 

UCI was ranked eighth in the 
standings, and UCLA was the 
top-ranked school in all of men's 
volleyball. With losses to tough 
Division I schools like USC and 
Pepperdine in back-to-back 
games, the Tritons knew they had 
a strong chance to get back in the 
playoff race with victories against 
Irvine and UCLA. 

"We knew UCI and UCLA 
were going to be difficult wins 
because they were both ranked," 
freshman Luke Honnette said. 
"But going into the match, we 
knew we could play well as a unit 
and get a victory, a t least." 

In the first set against Irvine, 
UCSD couldn't convert on many 
kill opportunities, hitting a di mal 
3.B percent of its shots . Even UC 
Irvine couldn't find their rhythm, 
hitting just 9.5 percent of their 
opportunities. 

The first set came down to exe-
cution and UCSD couldn't capital-
ize on a great play by Adam Toren 
and Jim Waller as they lost the set 
30-1B. I n the second set, both 
teams picked up the tempo, but 
UC Irvine was more precise, killing 
IB out of 31 shot attempts. 

The Tritons had opportunities 
as well, but only converted 11 out 
of 3 I kill attempts. They lost the 
set 30- 19 to set up a must-win 
third and final set to extend the 
match . 

The third set saw a better 
effort from UCSD when the team 
tried to avert elimination . The 
Tritons picked up the dismal hit-
ting display of the first two sets to 
kill 13 of 34 attempts. The pass-
ing picked up and the players 
communicated well across the 
field. 

Yet junior Jimmy Pelzel of 
Irvine took over the game when 
he made kills from everywhere on 
the court. UCSD lost the set 30-
23, as well as the match to drop 

. its record to 0-4 and 0-3 in con-
ference play. 

Adam Toren led the team with 
nine kills out of 15 attempts and 
kept his team within reach 
throughout the match. Sophomore 
Jim Waller and junior Eric Perrine 
had solid games with seven kills 
and six kills, respectively. Senior 
Jordan Hove and junior Matthew 
Miller added four digs to lead the 
Tritons in that category. 

Yet they were no match for 
Irvine's Pelzel who was the only 
player to record double-digit kills 
with 11 and had five digs in the 
effort. 

"In the beginning of the game 
against Irvine, there was a lack of 
communication among our play-
ers," Honnette said. "We got better 
in that category - as well as pass-
ing - as the match went on, and 
we know we are a solid team and 
can beat Irvine the next time we 
face them." 

The next match for the 
Tritons was against UCLA, which 
was no easy opponent. The 
Bruins came into the match with 
a record of 7-1 and 2-0 in confer-
ence play. The first set, however, 
showed that the Tritons were 

·worthyopponents.

Irvine and LA, ~ Honnette noted,

Tritons extend winning streak to 3 
Women's basketball beats Antelopes twice 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's basketball team played tag 
with Grand Canyon University last week, hosting the 
Antelopes at RIMAC Arena on Wednesday night, then 
following GCU to Phoenix to face off again Saturday 
night. 

On Wednesday, the Tritons prevailed over Grand 
Canyon in a low-scoring battle, 51-40. 

UCSD shot only 30.5 percent from the field, but 
was able to contain the winless 'Lopes to a stingy 27.5 
shooting percentage en route to the win. 

The Tritons never trailed in the game, and by the 
end of the first half had built a 25-20 lead. UCSD was 
led by California Collegiate Athletic Association 
Player of the Week Ali Ginn, who contributed II 
points to the victory and posted six rebounds and three 
steals. Freshman teammate Margaret Johnson was the 
only other Triton to score in double figures, finishing 
with 10 points and nine rebounds. 

Grand Canyon's Elizabeth Watson led all scorers 
with 13 points on 4-12 shooting, while the Antelopes 
also received II points off the bench from Florinda 
Curley in the loss. 

Three days later, the two teams squared off again, 
this time at Antelope Gym in Arizona. UCSD easily 
beat Grand Canyon 71-59. 

This time the Tritons did it with a hot hand from 
the field, shooting a blistering 55.5 percent from the 
field to build off a 30-23 halftime lead and eventually 
finish with a overall shooting percentage of 51.1 . 

Ginn, averaging 14.9 points per game for UCSD, 
again paced the Tritons, pouring in 2? po.ints. Nicholle 
Bromley joined fellow sophomore Gmn In double-fig-
ures, adding 10 points and eight rebounds. The 
Triton were also given a spark off the bench by Karina 
Siam, who went a perfect 3-3 from the field and fin-
ished with 10 points in 14 minutes. 

Grand Canyon again was led by Watson. who shot 
10-1 7 from the field to lead all scorers with 25 points. 
AntelopeJanet Glasby was the only other double-digit 
scorer for GCU, finishing with 10 points.

Men's basketball splits with GCU 
Tritons lose heartbreaker at home, win on road 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN

four days. 

Wednesday night'S game was a heartbreaker for the 
Tritons when they battled back from a 27-39 halftime 
deficitto pull within 73-76 with 21 seconds remaining. 

Triton Ryan Rikansrud , shooting 34.3 percent from 
beyond the arc this season, launched a three-pointer 
for the tie but was blocked by Grand Canyon's Sean 
Harris. The call was disputed by the Tritons, who con-
tended to no avai l that Harris had fouled Rikansrud. 

Antelope Jovian Dobrzenski sank two free throws 
with OJ seconds left to secure the 7B-73 victory for 
Grand Canyon. 

T he Tritons hurt themselves by shooting 31 per-
cent from the floor in the first half, and their 60 per-
cent from the field in the second half couldn't match 
GCU's overall shooting percentage of 54.4 percent . 

Guard Cameron Jackson went 7-11 from the floor 
to lead all scorers and finish with 17 points, while] ody 
Woods added 15 points and C.]. Duffaut contributed 
12 points off the bench. 

The 'Lopes finished with four players in double-
digits. They were led by Dobrzenski, who came off the 
bench to post 16 points for Grand Canyon. 

Saturday'S game in Arizona appeared to be the 
opposite for the Tritons because they dominated 
Grand Canyon on their way to a 43-29 halftime lead. 
UCSD held the Antelopes to a 32.1 shooting percent-
age in the first half and appeared to have the game in 
control. 

But Grand Canyon battled back in the second half 
and shot 16-36 from the field in the second half. 
Luckily, it wasn't enough as they fell to the Tritons, 
76-72. 

Freshman Jordan Watlcins burst out against the 
'Lopes, scoring 26 points on I 0-for-15 shooting. Ryan 
Swed posted 12 points and 13 rebounds for UCSD, 
while Nick Christensen added 16 points for the 
Tritons. 

UCSD currently stands at 4-B in league and 7-12 
overall, while GCU drops into a tie with the Tritons at 
4-B in league and 7-1 1 overall.

Baseball opens at home, splits first doubleheader 
Comeback falls short , Beaven throws three-hitter for Triton victory 

Lyon Liew/Cuordian 

By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's baseball team 
opened its season at home last week-
end, squaring off against California 
Baptist University in a doubleheader 
Saturday. 

In the first game, the Tritons lost 5-
4 after mounting a furious but failed 
comeback in the ninth inning. 

The Tritons took the early lead 
after sophomore centerfieldet Matt 
Smith singled, stole second, then 
scored on a single by junior Chad 
Addison. 

UCSD starting pitcher Keith Smith 
struggled in the second inning, giving 
up a run on four hits before stranding 
two Lancers on base. 

However, the Tritons got it back in 
the bottom of the inning, taking a 2-1 
lead after John Bologna singled to score 
David Hawk. 

reliever Rafael Bergstrom came in to 
close the inning. 

With two outs in the seventh inning, 
the Lancers stroked three consecutive 
singles to take a 5-2 lead. 

But that would be Cal Baptist's last 
run, because Addison scored off a Keith 
Hernandez single to decrease the 
deficit to two runs. 

After relievers James Sanders and 
Andy Hanau combined to shut out the 
Lancers for the last two innings, the 
Tritons came to bat in the bottom of 
the ninth, needing two runs to send the 
game into extra innings. 

Smith led the inning wi th a walk, 
then advanced to third after Addison 
singled through the right side. Third 
baseman Ryan Larson then brought 
Smith home on a sacrifice fl y to cen-
ter, placing the Tritons within one run 
of the Lancers. After Jeff Riddle hit 
into a fielde r 's choice, Hernandez 
then flied out to left field to end the 
game. 

Hit this: UCSD starting pitcher Keith Smith pitches to a Cal Baptist 
opponent last weekend at Triton Baseball Stadium. 

But in the Lancers' next at bat, des-
ignated hitter Esteban Enriquez home-
red off Smith to tie the game at two 
apiece. 

Cal Baptist then struck again in the 
fifth inning, scoring two runs before 

T he next game started much the 
same way as the first , with UCSD 
jumping ahead to an early lead against 
the Lancers. However, this time the 
Tritons prevailed 5- 1 behind the strong

Swimming beats Santa Cruz in dual meet 
Men 's and women's teams win, women gear up for rival USD 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

The Tritons hosted UC Santa Cruz on 
Jan. 26 in a dual meet at Canyonview Pool 
and easily swam past the Banana Slugs, win-
ning the men's and women's competitions. 

"1 knew we were going to beat them on 
both teams," head coach Scott McGihon 
said. "I knew my men and women were 
stronger than their men and women." 

The victory came at a crucial point in the 
season, when swimmers are battling fatigue. 

"I think it 's because it's about midterm 
time," Lopez said. "We've been doing this 
since before school started in September 
and it 's taking its toll now." 

McGihon agreed, saying rest is some-
thing his teams need to work on. 

"Right now the people pointed toward 
the conference championship ... just really 
need to start getting rest," he said. "If you 
talk to anybody on the team, they'll tell you 
tbey were sore before the meet." 

The women 's team dominated UCSC, 
winning nine out of 16 total events on the 
way to a 187-107 victory. 

The women were led by team captain 
Sandra Lopez, who pulled off a double vic-
tory in the 100- and 200-yard breaststroke. 

"Sandra Lopez is starting to swim real 
well," McGihon said. 

Lopez was pleased she could swi m 
through her exhaustion. 

"I was happy with the way that I swam, 
considering the hard workouts we've had 
since break," Lopez said. 

Elizabeth Sales also won two events, tak-
ing both the I-meter and 3 -meter diving 
events. 

"[Sales ' score of] 270 is a very good score 
for I-meter," McGihon said. "That's her 
highest score of the year." 

Despite the overall fatigue of the team, 
many of the swimmers posted their fastest 
times of the season. 

"Christine Hyjek had a pretty good day," 
McGihon said. "Her 1,000 [freestyle] was a 
good swim for her, her 400 1M was a great 
swim - her third -fastest time. Heather 
Hearon was a real surprise in the freestyle, 
that was her lifetime best." 

Other winners for the women include 
Carly Ross in the 50-yard freestyle event, 
Molly McCorkle in the ZOO-yard backstroke 
and Jennifer Watanabe in the 100-yard 
backstroke. 

However, the women were more focused 
on obtaining bids for the national champi-
onship than they were for winning individ-
ual events. 

"Our goal was to get [a consideration] 
for everyone," Lopez said. "I thi nk over half 
our team has received [them) . I'm more 
than 100 percent sure everyone at the con-
ference will get [bids) ." 

T he men also posted several bests en 
route to their 160- 108 victory. 

"In the 1,000 freestyle we had some real-
ly good performances," McGihon said . 
"[Winner Dagart Allison and No. 2 Cole 
Paffett) both turned in really good perfor-
mances both in terms of times and strate-
gies." 

However, it was Luke Seed who starred 
for the Tritons, winning both the 100-yard 
backstroke and the 100-yard butterfly. He 
also anchored the winning team for the 

200-yard medley relay, which consisted of 
Tad Nakatani, Grant Miller and C hristian 
Deck. 

"Luke Seed's 100-yard fly was a great 
swim for him," McGihon said . "We defi -
nitely didn't rest or anything before the 
meet." 

Nakatani also took home multiple 
events, winning both the 100- and 200-yard 
breaststroke. 

The other first-place finishers for the 
men include Michael Baier (400-yard 1M), 
Devin Spicer (200-yard butterfly) and Mark 
Tate (50-yard freestyle) 

While the men can now rest until the 
Pacific Collegiate Swim Conference 
Championships at Long Beach from Feb. 
18-20, the women are back in action next 
weekend against rival University of San 
Diego. 

"We are really excited," Lopez said. "In 
years past it's always been a big thing. We 
don't like the Toreros very much. We want 
to beat them. To beat a Division I team in 
San Diego would be awesome. We'd like to 
kick their butts."

Cal Baptist to three hits and one 
unearned run, while handing out only 
two walks to the Lancers 

UCSD took a 1-0 lead in the third 
inning when designated hitter Matt 
Merrifield was hit by Lancer pitcher 
Teddy Sutton. After second baseman 
Anthony Lococo advanced Merrifield 
to second , a balk by Sutton moved him 
over to third with one out. Hawk then 
came through again for the Tritons 
with a sacrifice fly to account for 
UCSD 's first run. 

Cal Baptist tied it up in the top of 
the fifth inning after Riddle 's throwing 
error allowed Lancer Dan Mahaffie to 
score. 

However, in the bottom of the 
inning, the Tritons picked up Riddle, 
scoring four runs to nail the coffin on 
Cal Baptist. Merrifield's two-run dou-
ble and Hawk's two-run home run 
capped a four-run inning for the 
Tritons to place the game out of reach 
for the Lancers. 

From there it was all Beaven; he shut 
out Cal Baptist for the next two 
innings, finishing with six strikeouts in 
seven innings. 

Women's 
tennis 
sweeps 
(SUSB again 
Tritons strong in 
first competition 
By COREY HOLMAN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's tennis team 
began its 2002 season Saturday after-
noon, sweeping the Coyotes of Cal 
State San Bernardino 9-0. 

The Tritons blew past the Coyotes 
last season as well . However, despite 
what the score indicates, their oppo-
nent was much improved. 

"They were a lot better this year," 
sophomore Kristina Jansen said. "They 
didn't have as many holes in their 
team." 

In their first competitive match of 
- the season, the Tritons used outstand-

ing play from last season's all-California 
Collegiate Athletic Association First 
Team member Julie Westerman and 
Second Team player Lyndsey Tadlock 
to propel them to the easy victory. 

Westerman, playing as the No. 6 
single, didn 't lose a single game, defeat-
ing San Bernardino's limetra Hampton 
6-0, 6-0. Tadlock likewise beat Coral 
Conley without losing a game in the 
matchup of No. 3 singles players. 

Tadlock and Westerman later com-
bined to form UCSD's No. 1 doubles 
team, which defeated the Coyotes team 
of Conley and Cassie Sumrow 8-4. 

"We were a little shaky in this 
match," Jansen said. "We all were defi-
nitelya bit nervous." 

But nerves were nowhere to be 
found in the final outcome. The closest 
doubles match of the afternoon 
occurred when UCSD's Ashley O'Neil 
and Mary Hung defeated Heather
