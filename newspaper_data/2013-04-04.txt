Coverage

BY  davis liang staff writer

The San Diego Metropolitan 
Transit System has introduced a pilot 
program for its SuperLoop Route 
201 and 202 buses with service to 
existing stops at Gilman Drive and 
Eucalyptus Grove Lane and the 
Gilman Drive footbridge beginning 
March 28. Two accompanying 
SuperLoop bus shelters will be built 
on campus.

The purpose of the pilot program 
is to “help students, faculty, staff, 
and visitors and test the potential 
of creating permanent SuperLoop 
stops” at the Gilman footbridge, 
according to a statement released by 
MTS and the San Diego Association 
of Governments. MTS Director of 
Marketing and Communications Rob 
Schupp reported that “SuperLoop 
riders have requested the location” as 
a stop on the route.

“We believe [the new stops] will 
be very popular,” Schupp said. “We 
expect that as many as half of the 
SuperLoop riders not getting on and 
off at Gilman and Myers will use the 
footbridge pair of stations — this will 
help spread out demand on campus.”

MTS reports that the SuperLoop 

The secret is out: Hip-hop artist Kendrick Lamar and electronic dance music 
producer Porter Robinson will 
headline this year’s Sun God 
Festival on Friday, May 17.

The festival will also mark the 
introduction of the newly branded 
Sun God stage, replacing last year’s 
main stage.

Other artists accompanying 
Kendrick Lamar on the Sun God 
stage include Andrew McMahon 
and Youngblood Hawke, while 
headliner Porter Robinson, RAC, 
IndO and Geo-D will perform as 
part of the dance stage lineup.

Due to contractual obligations, 
the remaining Sun God stage and 
dance stage acts will be announced 
in an official second release at the 
end of this month and will include 
direct support acts for both stages 
and all Midway acts.

“This year we were trying to 
really focus on a headliner that a lot 
of students would be pleased to see,” 
A.S. Concerts and Events Festivals 
Coordinator Alisha Vallabhapurapu 
said. “And Kendrick Lamar is a very 
upcoming hip-hop artist.”

According to Associate Vice 
President of Concerts and Events 
Eric Babajanian, it was easier for 
ASCE to choose performers for 
this year’s festival due to a student 

survey released during fall quarter.
“[The survey] really helped us 

decide who we wanted, because we 
had a 99-percent confidence level,” 
Babajanian said. “It was easy for us 
to decide what types of artists we 
wanted.”

Over 2,000 students responded 
to the survey — with the incentive 
of two Sun God guest tickets for 
completing the survey — in an effort 
that was much more thorough and 
organized than last year’s attempts, 
according to Babajanian.

“[Silversun Pickups] is an 
amazing act,” ASCE Festivals 
Director Andrea Hsueh said in 
response to audience feedback 
regarding last year’s headliner. “At 
the same time, Kendrick is more 
relevant to our student body right 
now, and we’re more on the pulse 
with what they wanted. The survey 
that we took overwhelmingly said 
that hip-hop/rap is what students 
are really into.”

This year, ASCE will sell 3,000 
student guest tickets at $65 each, 
demonstrating a $5 increase in box 
office fees from last year. However, 
the A.S. base price of $55 will stay 
consistent with previous years, 
according to Babajanian.

The Alumni Association will 
sell a maximum of 500 alumni 
tickets one week prior to student

Introduces

Program

An advisory board voted 
unanimously to remove 
$10,000 prescription drug 
coverage cap.

Beginning March 28, 
Superloop Routes 201 and 
202 will service existing 
stops along Gilman Drive.

The UC Office of the President 
is considering several changes to the 
UC Student Health Insurance Plan, 
including the removal of annual cov-
erage caps.

The UC SHIP advisory board, an 
assembly of students and healthcare 
representatives from each UC campus, 
and UCOP met on Friday, March 22 
to discuss possible changes to SHIP 
for the next academic year. They 
voted unanimously to eliminate the 
$10,000 annual prescription drug cov-
erage cap. All but one campus voted to 
eliminate the $450,000 lifetime maxi-
mum for undergraduate students and 
the $750,000 maximum for graduate 
students. These caps are expected to 
be lifted for the 2013–2014 academic 
year.

According to Matthew Mayeda, 
co-chair of UCSD’s SHIP advisory 
board, drawbacks of SHIP also include 
a relatively small variety of treatment 
facilities available for those covered 
under the insurance policy — primary 
care is delivered at Student Health 
Services, and specialty care outside 
SHS requires a referral.

Historically, SHIP premiums have

UCSD researchers collaborated 
with the Samsung Advanced 
Institute of Technology in Korea 
to conduct a two-year experiment 
to explore the possibilities of 
generating thousands of odors in a 
small device that could fit on your 
TV, filling the room with hundreds 
of different aromas seen on screen.

Professor of mechanical, 
aerospace and nanoengineering 
at the UCSD Jacobs School of 
Engineering Sungho Jin and his 
team of graduate students used 
an X-Y matrix system to reduce 
the circuitry that would allow the 
system to be placed in a compact 
device.

The research was primarily 
focused on miniaturizing the odor-
releasing technology currently 
found in 4-D theaters operated 
by South Korean conglomerate 
CJ Group. Whether the responses 
to such technology in consumer 
electronics that the research 
targeted, such as televisions and 
cell phones, will be as positive as it 

has been for 4-D movies remains to 
be seen.

CJ Group’s 4DX system 
combines movements, smells and 
tactile experiences with traditional 
3-D technologies to provide 
the moviegoer with a new 4-D 
experience. 

Special programmers spend 
weeks making use of the moving 
seats, water-spraying nozzles, 
mist, bubbles, giant fans, strobe 
lights and a collection of 1,000 
scents to create a more immersive 
experience.

Advances in technology allow 
the system to finally simulate 
multiple senses at once. For 
example, in “Pirates of the 
Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,” 
the seats swayed as ocean smells 
and mist were released to take the 
audience to out to a rowboat on the 
ocean.

In recent years, the film 
industry has seen a decline in 
sales as Blu-ray and HDTVs have 
provided a cheaper home theater 
experience.

“Theatres need to find new 

ways to bring people back to the 
multiplex and away from their 
couches,” Theodore Kim, chief 
operating officer for the Los 
Angeles lab of CJ 4DPlex, said to 
the Los Angeles Times.

CJ Group owns and operates 
the largest chain of movie theaters 
across Asia, including 29 4-D 
theaters in Thailand, Mexico 
and South Korea. The company 
reports sell-out crowds and great 
responses in these special theaters 
that regularly show Hollywood 
hits such as “Avatar,” “Prometheus” 
and “Pirates of the Caribbean: On 
Stranger Tides.”

For all the successes of 4-D, 
though, adopting the new technology 
may take a while because of its high 
costs. It costs about $2 million to 
install one 4-D system in a single 
theater, meaning consumers will help 
pay the price with an increase in ticket 
prices of up to eight dollars. It also 
means a full 4-D experience at home 
is years away.

Sun God Babies Will Return as Part of  ASCE Publicity Efforts

guest ticket sales, and any unsold 
alumni tickets will be included in 
the student guest ticket pool.

As with last year, guest tickets 
may only be purchased by UCSD 
students or employees, with a limit 
of one guest per person.

Although ASCE has yet to 
finalize any allocations within its 
$500,000 Sun God Festival budget, 
it expected to spend $180,000 on 
talent and the other $320,000 (as 
well as any sponsorship and vendor 

fee supplements) on production, 
security, box office and other 
aspects of the festival.

ASCE is also in the process 
of confirming all sponsorship 
contracts, including sponsors for 
the festival lounge that will replace 
last year’s D’lush lounge.

The Sun God Babies will return 
this year, as part of ASCE publicity 
efforts, which also emphasize 
student health and safety initiatives.

ASCE will also continue 
its emphasis on art and student 
involvement, with plans to showcase 

student art at the festival. The Battle 
of the Bands and DJ Battle will also 
return this year; winners of each 
contest will be announced on April 
5 and April 8, respectively, and will 
be given a chance to perform in the 
festival. Midway performers are also 
yet to be selected but will no longer 
be purely comedy-based, according 
to Babajanian.

ASCE officially announced the 
lineup on April 1 on its website.

UCOP: a 25 Percent Increase in SHIP Premiums Possible 

been too low to sustain the program. 
Even at the current $385.46 per quar-
ter for undergraduates and $598.39 
per quarter for graduates, SHIP has 
accumulated a $57 million deficit 
since 2001. To keep current benefit 
levels, UCOP is considering raising 
premiums by an average of 25 percent 
systemwide in order to close the gap. 
Other price increases such as a slight 
increase in pharmacy co-payments, 
and co-payments for MRIs and CAT 
scans could also take place.

According to Brooke Converse, a 
UCOP media relations representative, 
the removal of spending caps will not 
only increase premiums but will help 

reinvent SHIP policy to comply with 
the Affordable Care Act’s ban on life-
time and annual prescription drug 
limits on essential care — a require-
ment from which UC SHIP, as a self-
funded insurance program, is exempt.

“If you remove the benefit maxi-
mum, then the potential cost is 
unlimited,” UC SHIP director Heather 
Pineta said. “It would increase the cost 
of the plan for every plan member 
because it would increase the potential 
liability.”

Although unlimited coverage will 
benefit students who suffer from sud-
den and serious health issues, it can-
not afford private health insurance 
premiums.

“I understand that any increase in 

fees can be very hard on students 
in today’s economy,” said Matthew 
Mayeda, co-chair of UCSD’s SHIP 
advisory board. “That being said, I 
feel that it is a very altruistic move 
by the UCs to move to a plan with-
out lifetime or pharmacy caps, as 
the students who reach these caps 
are often very sick. I personally feel 
that a rare cancer or bad car acci-
dent should not be a reason why a 
student has to withdraw from their 
academic studies.”
    The council of chancellors will 
issue the final decision regarding 
changes to SHIP on May 1, 2013.

Superloop Buses Carry Over 1.5 Million Passengers Each Year

buses alone carry over 1.5 million 
passengers each year.

The SuperLoop 201 and 202 
buses have existing stops on UCSD’s 
campus at the Scripps Memorial 
Hospital La Jolla and at Gilman 

Drive and Myers Drive. Their routes 
serve the northern University City 
area and are based out of the UTC 
Transit Center at the Westfield 
Shoppingtown UTC.

Routes that already serve the 
Gilman footbridge stops include 
the MTS routes 30 and 150 to 

downtown San Diego, the North

Council Talks Sustainability in  
Final Meeting Before Elections

After something like three 
weeks off of A.S. Council meetings, 
it was pretty surreal to walk into 
the Forum. But the booming voice 
of Richard Thompson ’83 soon 
brought back memories of anxiety 
and Chinese food, and I felt at home, 
kind of.

Public input 
opened with 
Divestment 2: 
The Resolution 
That Just Won’t 
Die. Jumanah 
Albahri of SJP spoke on behalf 
of the organization to commend 
council but also to express hurt that 
the resolution’s language had been 
changed.

Sarah Tehrani, speaking out 
against the resolution and criticizing 
council for the 
outcome, brought up 
an idea that hadn’t at 
all occurred to me.

“To spend $5,000 
in student fees to 
talk about how other 
people spend their 
money is ridiculous,” 
she said. “You failed 
this entire campus 
with your decision.”

The incredulity of 
that statement is made 
even more apparent 
when considering 
Chancellor Khosla’s 
n e a r - i m m e d i a t e 
rebuttal to the 
divestment resolution. 
Khosla penned a response 
reaffirming the UC Board of 
Regents’ policy of investment for the 
UC system, thereby shutting down 
any hope SJP had of furthering the 
goals of divestment this year, and 
rendering nearly three weeks of 

heated debate as little more than 
talk.

And it’s not quite a free exchange 
of ideas if we’re paying a few 
thousand dollars for the privilege. 
On a campus facing budget deficits 
up the wazoo, I understand why 
some students see it as irresponsible 

to devote those 
kinds of resources 
to any single 
issue.

(I’m not sure 
what a wazoo 

is, but we certainly have money 
problems all up in it.)

Representatives from the Student 
Sustainability Collective gave a 
special presentation regarding their 
activities over the year.

SSC accomplished some 
admirable goals, 
including UCSD’s anti-
bottled water initiative 
that will affect campus 
markets by 2014 — 
bad news for anyone 
looking to pocket extra 
coinage by recycling 
water bottles.

SSC is also 
sponsoring sustainable 
eating education 
programs to teach 
participants that 
each meal does not 
have to end in a mass 
extinction. Personally, 
I hope that these 
initiatives will end the 
turducken nightmare 

once and for all.
All through this meeting, I felt 

that we were lacking a certain zing 
and pep — and then I realized 
why. AVP College Affairs Leonard 
Bobbitt was sadly absent. Come 
back soon, Leonard.

Love of  
Pillow Forts, 
Love of  a 
Cozy Home

I spent my spring break like many of us would have, bur-rowing into the cosseting 
embrace of my bed, reveling in the 
absence of dining hall food and 
loving every lazy minute of it. But 
there was something more driving 
my emotion than just my return to 
a comfortable life: A strange force 
of wistful longing and contentment. 
This was my sense of home implor-
ing me to stay.

Our notion of what home is 
has a profound influence on our 
character. The Atlantic magazine 
quotes environmental psychologist 
Susan Clayton as saying that “for 
many people, home is part of their 
self-definition.” So while we all love 
to snuggle up in the blankets we 
had when we were 5 years old, the 
sensations bring back memories of 
our formative years, when we could 
frolic all day in our pillow forts and 
get candy from our grandparents.

Apart from shaping our accents 
and lending us odd bits of ver-
nacular, home forces us to think 
about who we are, who we were, 
and everything that affected us in 
between. We carry this identity to 
school, creating a mosaic of dif-
ferent personalities and attitudes. 
While the majority of UCSD stu-
dents call somewhere in California 
home, there’s always that one kid 
from Hawaii who beams with 
delight at being associated with 
the sun, the surf and the leis. And 
apart from the self-effacing among 
us who insult their hometowns to 
no end, we are, for the most part, 
fiercely proud of our communities 
and our pasts.

There are also more concrete 
bases for our feelings. According 
to the Financial Times, research 
has shown that the human brain is 
stimulated and pleased by pictures, 
colors, textures and other sensory 
details. All of these are catalysts for 
that warm and fuzzy sensation of 
place and belonging. 

The faded sky-blue chair in my 
foyer, the bright Lego-themed com-
forter and the soft carpet underfoot 
were all part of my conception 
of home. When I walked in and 
dumped my luggage on the floor, 
they all welcomed me back with 
that feeling of “home at last” nos-
talgia. While home decor may not 
inspire such effusive sentiment in 
more itinerant house-movers, there 
is ultimately a sense of recognition 
that lets us know that we’re back, 
that we’re safe — that we are finally 
insulated from midterms, course-
work or whatever burdens may be 
upon us.

You might think, though, that 
the bland dorms of UCSD are 
hardly conducive to such joyous 
feelings. Indeed, it’s hard to grow 
attached to a place when you’re 
forced to be a patron of Cafe V. 
Years from now, however, when 
you’re living in a miserable cor-
ner of the world working on your 
postdoc and hating the place, it 
will undoubtedly be satisfying to 
boast to your coworkers about your 
time spent in sunny La Jolla. When 
you’re stumping through chest-
deep rivers in search of specimens, 
your sense of home will make you 
wish you had never left the warmth 
of your dorm’s twin-XL bed.

Thinking Caps

Simply banning unhealthy behav-
iors doesn’t work. 

For one thing, a flat-out ban 
is virtually impossible to enforce, 
something a New York judge noted 
in his ruling, which struck down 
the city’s ambitious decade-long 
attempt to curb consumption of 
sugary drinks.

 For another thing, a ban doesn’t 
make economic sense. Prohibition, 
a nationwide alcohol ban that was in 
place in the 1920s, was struck down 
in 1933 because, in the words of his-
torian Robert Blakely, “the govern-
ment just wanted in again.” 

Bans have never bent behaviors 
on any significant scale, and they 
won’t work again next January, when 
Mark Yudof ’s UC-wide smoking ban 
takes effect.

Enforcement at public universi-
ties, which are largely outdoors and 
span multiple buildings, is either a 
nightmarish challenge for police or a 
non-priority.

The final word isn’t in yet, but 

preliminary data suggest that the 
national movement to ban smoking 
at colleges (774 have done it already) 
has been ineffective. Although the 
number of college campuses that 
have banned smoking is up a full 4 
percent from last year, the number of 
18- to 24-year-olds who smoke has 
increased by half a percent, accord-
ing to researchers at the Harvard 
School of Public Health.

Counterintuitive as it may seem, 
the data indicate that telling rebel-
lious youngsters that they’re banned 
from smoking is actually the best 
way to keep them going. And nutri-
tionists are realizing this: A 2012 
Penn State University study found 
that when it comes to promoting 
healthy diet behaviors, subtle mea-
sures are much more effective than 
drastic, punitive ones.

Fewer than 9 percent of UCSD 
students smoke, and for the most 
part, they are courteous about it. 
Smoking is no longer an act of rebel-
lion, as it was in the ’60s, according 

to a 2010 study published by Yale 
researchers in the American Journal 
of Public Health. Most of today’s 
students smoke to stay focused while 
they study, in addition to other fac-
tors like stress and addiction, the 
researchers found. It’s likely, the 
researchers noted, that a steep tax 
would be enough for these students 
to give up the cigarettes for a cup of 
coffee instead.

Economic solutions like these are 
not only more sustainable — they’re 
more mature. They’re also easier to 
enforce and implement than an out-
right ban on cigarettes. Charging the 
General Store a sharp administrative 
fee for every pack of cigarettes it 
sells would strongly discourage cash-
strapped students from indulging in 
an extra pack of cigarettes. 

And who knows — maybe the 
revenue from a cigarette fee could 
even buy us another year of student 
bus stickers. But that’s being overly 
optimistic, much like Yudof ’s smok-
ing ban itself.

Subtle Measures Will Best Reduce Smoking Rates

Illustration  by  Snighdha Paul

If you’ve been anywhere near social media this week, you probably already know that there’s an overwhelmingly positive response to this 
year’s Sun God Festival lineup. The Guardian 
agrees: A.S. Concerts and Events got it right this 
year. Up-and-coming rapper Kendrick Lamar 
will be headlining the main stage, with Porter 
Robinson at the dance stage. There will also be 
a second lineup release at the end of April that 
should be a promising addition to this already stel-
lar lineup. 

In years past, Sun God lineups have been filled 
with two kinds of artists: the unknown and the too 
known. Examples of the “too well-known” include 
Silversun Pickups and Big Sean. Everyone knew 
that one song “Lazy Eye,” but no one really cared 
to hear an emo anthem after a long day of inebria-
tion. Most students were laying on the grass rather 
than dancing, and that isn’t the kind of response 

a headliner should get. Examples of the unknown 
are, well, unknown. Why have we spent money on 
previous Sun God artists who are past their prime 
(Jimmy Eat World) or have no foreseeable prime 
whatsoever (Yacek)? 

The budget for the festival always stays the 
same: $530,000 (with a $20,000 contingency). 
Approximately $180,000 was spent on talent this 
year, while the remainder of the money goes 
toward other festival essentials (security, stages, 
lights, etc.). This is a very large number, and 
upon an initial glance, it might seem like cause 
for concern. The budget has remained consistent 
for a number of years in order to produce and 
maintain the quality tradition that UCSD students 
look forward to most. Fees and student opposition 
often go hand in hand, but the general consensus

W hen the Internet’s popularity rose, the music business worried that the pro-liferation of file-sharing Web sites like 
Napster and LimeWire meant the death of the 
entire music industry. A free, easy alternative 
to traditional sales, these companies felt that 
they threatened profits — and thus the very 
existence — of music; within years computer 
whiz bootleggers would demolish a decades-
old record company infrastructure.

Meet Aaron Dontez Yates, better known by 
his stage name Tech N9ne (pronounced “Tech 
Nine”), an Internet-savvy rap pioneer who has 
helped pave the way for accessible music.

“Thank God for technology, man,” Tech 
joked, his voice made gravelly by a bad phone 
connection after 16 straight sold-out perfor-
mances and a cold, wet night spent watching 
Kendrick Lamar after his own performance 
at the Paid Dues Festival. But he’s being seri-
ous, too. Without technology, specifically the 
Internet, Tech N9ne wouldn’t be where he is 
now. (Side note: During the interview, he is 
on his tour bus somewhere between LA and 
Sacramento.) Fermenting in rap-backwater 
Kansas City, Missouri, Tech had little access 
to the traditional media channels that helped 
his coastal colleagues’ careers. And when, after 
years of refining his craft in relative obscurity, 
Tech found the Internet which he co-opted, 
instead of fighting. In 2002, for example, he 
released “Absolute Power” and asked his listen-
ers to download the album for free, legally.

In a world now inundated with free mix-
tapes, that might not seem impressive. But at 
the time, it signaled a fundamental shift in the 
music industry. Technology was making rap 
music more democratic. Distribution costs 
were lowered, if not removed entirely. Success 
in rap didn’t require a deal with a major label; 
it required a computer.

This had two important (if perhaps obvi-
ous) consequences for rap music, and both are 
exemplified by Tech’s career.

First: Audiences have a wider selection 
of artists to choose from. So long as the only 
channels for finding rap music are the radio 
and physical records, the distribution costs 
associated with these channels would keep 
independent rappers from reaching a wide 
audience. Under these constraints, the rap 

selection is determined by those who have suf-
ficient resources — large record companies. 
By opening a new channel for dispersing rap 
music, the Internet widens the range of offbeat 
rappers (like Tech) for listeners to discover.

Conversely, independent rappers found 
wider audiences, both in and out of the coun-
try. Markets that were previously off-limits 
were suddenly (literally) within arm’s reach. 
With the Internet, rappers can spread wider 
and dream bigger.

“The future holds world domination 
for Strange Music (his record label) … 
not just regional. Global domination — 
I haven’t touched every place yet, and 
that’s our quest,” he said. 

The second consequence of 
Internet distribution is that art-
ists did not have to conform 
to record labels’ ideal types to 
be heard. Instead, artists can 
be eccentric. Tech N9ne is 
a prime example of this. 
Frankly, he’s a little weird. 
He’s had the spider leg 
hairstyle distinctive of 
Juggalos. He paints 
his face. He raps 
about drinking 
his own eso-
teric alcoholic 
beverage 
(the ever-
dangerous 
Caribou 
Lou), not 
Ace of 
Spades 
cham-
pagne or 
Nuvo. He’s 
exactly 
the kind 
of rapper 
you would 
have never 
heard 
with-
out the 
Internet. 
But you 

have (or at least, you have now).
That’s not to say that the Internet has total-

ly subsumed all traditional music media. Tech 
recently benefited from a verse on Lil Wayne’s 
“Carter IV” and an appearance on the BET 
Awards Cypher. 

“It helps people really see who Tech N9ne 
was, instead of just hearing his name all these 
years,” Tech said. 

He’s still touring every year, currently head-
lining the “Independent Powerhouse Tour,” 

a 55-event blitz of the United States 
with his label-mates. These tradi-

tional channels are still important, 
but they’re no longer restricted to 

more established artists. To get 
on the BET cypher or to book a 

profitable tour date, a rapper 
doesn’t need a major label 

contract. He needs Internet 
buzz. And Tech N9ne has 

buzz in abundance.
To return to the 

second consequence, 
the Internet has 

democratized 
rap music by 

accepting and 
celebrating 

nontra-
ditional 
artists. 
It has 
allowed 
rappers 
to gain 
notoriety 
without 
chang-
ing their 
style. 
And, 
again, 
Tech is 
a great 
exam-
ple of 
this. 
Despite 
his 

appearances on MTV, BET and Lil Wayne’s 
album, Tech insists he hasn’t let his newfound 
popularity make him conform.

“I’m still the King of Darkness,” he said. 
“I’m still painting my face. I will never con-
form…the reward is greater later when you do 
exactly what you do and still touch everybody.”

And that’s true, to an extent. But he has 
changed — or at least evolved. It would be 
remarkable, and probably bad, if he were the 
same artist who rapped in the groups Black 
Mafia and Rogue Dog Villains in the early 
1990s. The biggest change, though, is not sub-
stantive, but technical.

“I’m more precise,” he said. “I’m better, I’m 
totally polished. I’ve always done me. Now, my 
music is bleeding over into the mainstream, 
and I didn’t have to do anything different, 
because real shit always shines — this is my 
music I do.”

To belabor the point, the Internet has 
let “real shit” shine. And there are countless 
acts that are beholden to the path that Tech 
N9ne has blazed. For all we know, without the 
Internet, Odd Future, Danny Brown, Le1f, Lil 
B and any other antitraditional act could still 
be unknown.

For balance, here are a couple issues with 
Internet-age rap music: The Internet has 
flooded listeners with nearly unmanageable 
amounts of bad rap. That seems unavoid-
able. For every Tech N9ne, there are 10 more 
rappers lurking on YouTube who shouldn’t 
be allowed near a mic. The triage needed to 
find rappers like Tech requires more time 
than most casual listeners have. Also, while 
the Internet has freed artists from record 
label conformity constraints, the artists are in 
no sense free from all constraints. They are 
merely beholden to a new media — the blogo-
sphere. What longterm effect that will have on 
rap music is still unclear, but it should not be 
ignored.

For better or worse, Internet gave us Tech 
N9ne — brutal, but sincere, weird and unorth-
odox, but unique. He is a rapper who’s differ-
ent, but gloriously so, and for that, we have the 
Internet to thank.

i ’m paranoid. I’m scared of a lot of things, and I have a lot of creepy dreams. Honestly, I think that’s 
why I’m so interested in dreams. 

When I was five years old, I loved 
playing with dolls, especially the life-
sized baby dolls with blonde hair and 
blue eyes that opened and closed. 
Coincidentally, the oldest dream that 
I can remember is also about a baby 
doll. And since I had that dream, I’ve 
never wanted to see a doll again.

In the dream, I move into an 
empty apartment with the exception 
of one item on the carpeted floor: 
a box containing a doll. The case is 
made of flimsy pink cardboard and 
contains a window of clear plastic on 
the cover so that the doll’s face is vis-
ible inside. As soon as I look into the 
plastic cover, its eyes snap open. And 
it scares the shit out of me. 

Imagine a horror movie. A dead 
man’s eyes pop open with cymbals 
playing in the background. I jump 
back from the doll and watch in 
horror as it gets out of the case and 
starts to walk towards me. I am para-
lyzed for a moment. Then I run. 

I frantically run to get away. 
Somewhere along the dream, ran-
dom toys appear inside of the apart-
ment. I remember riding on a toy 
truck with a band of stuffed animals 
in the back seat, looking over my 
shoulder at the unceasing doll wad-
dling my way. No matter how much 
I try to escape, the doll is always a 
few steps away with its fingers never 
reaching but always close to my 
back.

The doll never got to me, but I 
was never free of it. 

I always woke up somewhere 
in the middle of the never-ending 
chase. The dream opened a whole 
gateway of nightmares and recurred 
every few years or so with some 
variations.

Sometimes the chase would only 
be in the apartment. At other times I 
would leave the apartment and ride 
on the back of a jeep to get away. No 
matter what, the doll would still be 
a couple of feet away. In a few rare 
occasions, I would sit on the card-
board box as soon as the doll started 
moving so that it couldn’t get out. 
Those instances were the most hor-
rifying because the doll would begin 
to melt as it thrashed around in the 
case.

The dream was the beginning 
of a series of chasing dreams. I get

the Dolls: A

Remember the Tritons
With Triton Day on April 6th, Lifestyle writers reflect on the woes and wonders of being 

accepted to UCSD, Triton Day and what it felt like to be a freshman.

t housands of high school seniors will be on campus this Saturday for the annual Triton Day, which introduces fresh admits to the 
glory of UCSD. Campus orgs and clubs will be 
setting the energy for the day along with available 
information fairs and tours to get new Tritons 
exploring campus. 

The University of California, San Diego is 
located in the heart of one of Cali’s most affluent 
communities — La Jolla. According to US News, 
it is the 38th ranked university in the nation. It 
could have been your first choice or it could have 
been your last, but regardless, this is where you 
ended up. You became a Triton.

It all started with a letter or a webpage that 

said “congratulations” and then an invitation to 
the first step to the next four years of your life — 
Triton Day. Held on April 6th this year, Triton 
Day goes on from 7 a.m. until 4 p.m. and is filled 
with tours tailored to each admit’s college and 
major.

All the potential freshman on campus creates 
the perfect environment for reminiscing. Looking 
at all the youth makes you remember when you 
were accepted to UCSD and what it was like to 
be a freshman all over again. So we’ve asked our 
writers to look back, and you as well, on what 
Triton Day means. As you reflect, you might find 
some Triton pride and realize that Triton Day is 
actually worth going to.

While in high school, I never 
thought going to a university 
like UCSD was even possible. 
Transferring to UCSD from a 
community college was the best 
decision I have made. I remem-
ber the exact day I logged onto 
my account to view my applica-
tion status, and I was being con-
gratulated. My heart dropped, 
and I quickly called my mom to 
share the great news. That was 
one of my proudest moments. 
All of my hard work had paid 
off and looking back now, I 
realize just how special that 
moment was. As a senior, I am 
preparing to graduate and look-
ing back on the past two years, I 
truly feel that I had the best two 
years of my life here at UCSD.

It all started with a call. I was 
driving with a friend on the way 
to an Edward Sharpe and the 
Magnetic Zeros Concert when I 
received an incoming call from 
a foreign area code. I answered 
the call, and a student on the 
phone congratulated me on 
my acceptance to UCSD. I was 
shocked. Triton Day is all a blur, I 
remember walking onto campus 
with an inflated face from my 
recent wisdom teeth removal and 
hoping that people don’t think 
I actually look like a chipmunk. 
Surprisingly, my inflated face did 
not make me feel shunned, in fact 
it was just the opposite — I felt 
like I was in the right place and 
that UCSD was the place for me.

I remember sitting by the 
computer, my family and I anx-
iously awaiting to see if I got 
accepted into UCSD. Tritonlink 
switched from the its blue screen 
to “Congratulations!” I felt a wave 
of sheer excitement and relief. 
I had gotten in. All those hours 
and hours of studying, countless 
money spent on SAT and AP prep 
books had all paid off. I had got-
ten into my number one school.
The summer dragged on. I would 
count down the days until I was 
off to UCSD. Freshman year can 
be described as one of the best and 
worst years of my life. A year filled 
with pseudo- independence and 
confusion. It was a life-changing 
year of trial and error and self 
discovery.

— Nichole Perri
StaffWriter

UCSD was not my first pick. I 
remember going to a Muse con-
cert with my friend before college 
apps were due and him saying that 
he would love to go to UCSD. I 
told him that UCSD didn’t inter-
est me at all. When I was filling 
out UC apps, there was an option 
to apply to as many UCs as you 
wanted, so I mindlessly clicked SD 
along with others. I was admitted 
to UCSD. That’s when I actually 
began researching what UCSD 
was all about. But I knew San 
Diego would have things to offer. 

I didn’t even go to Triton Day 
when I was a senior, and last year 
as a freshman I remember avoid-
ing campus like the plague that 
day, but I’m actually looking for-
ward to participating this year.

A lthough it may be hard relating to the mass of soon-to-be freshmen that are about to come through our gates — especially 
with the violent sea of blue, yellow and three 
pronged sticks waiting to numb our brains — 
remember that we were all there at one point. It 
wasn’t that long ago that we were about to enter 
the unknown, primed to compare each college 

moment to scenes from “Animal House.” 
Remember, this is supposed to be the time 

of our lives, so if you’re feeling that UCSD isn’t 
living up to what you expected as an anxious 
freshman, then go out and make this campus 
yours. Join a club, try a sport, start a band — 
whatever. Make the most of this coming year. 
The time is yours.

dreams of being chased by dino-
saurs, dogs, zombies, giant bugs and 
the strangest things you can imagine. 
While dreams are not real, I have 
started to see its effects in my life. 

I get easily startled, and my 
apartment-mates think it’s because I 
have a guilty conscience. But when 
you just dreamt about a black shad-

ow chasing you around all night, 
being jumpy is understandable. I am 
afraid of falling asleep. 

I think that is what motivated 
me to keep a dream diary. Writing 
my dreams down seals them in fic-
tion and makes them seem less real 
to me. I keep a notebook next to 
my bed and jot down my dreams as 
soon as I wake up so that they’re still 
fresh. I date all my entries and try to 

write something for everyday, even 
when the details seem insignificant 
at first.

After doing it for a few years, 
I can recall most of my dreams in 
vivid detail and write pages for a 
single scene. There are a few fuzzy 
days, and sometimes I don’t remem-
ber anything at all, but practice defi-
nitely makes perfect.

Dreams are like a double-edged 

sword. They sweep you into a world 
you may not have been able to con-
jure on your own, a world you may 
later realize that you never wanted 
to enter. But it is this wildness, this 
never knowing what you're going to 
get, which gets me hooked to figure 
it all out.

there seems to be one recurring problem when try-ing to study at a 
coffee shop: they don't 
have enough electrical 
outlets. Not only does 
this make for limited 
options, but also limited 
luxuries. In looking for 
a comfortable place to 
study, we try to find 
a space that fits most 
of our needs: food, an 
abundance of outlets 
and, more importantly, 
caffeine. Krakatoa Cafe 
has everything we students need for 
efficient study.

With its home-style decor, 
Krakatoa Cafe doubles as a great study 
spot on busy days and a good place to 
catch up with friends on more relaxed 
ones. The real find at Krakatoa seems 
to be the patio seating. Inside, there’s a 
congenial, snug feel that you’ll find at 
most cafes, and a step outside leads to 
a more relaxing space to gather your 
thoughts. Krakatoa also has a parking 
lot, which is crucial, since when you’re 
studying, you don’t want to constantly 

be running outside to add quarters 
to a meter. There’s nothing better 
than fresh air and free Wi-Fi accom-

panied by great coffee to 
get some work done. 

Serving a wide range 
of sandwiches, des-
serts and coffee; a local 
favorite is the freshly 
prepared Ubehebe 
sandwich. It is the most 
popular item on their 
sandwich menu because 
it consists of oven-roast-
ed turkey breast, maple-
cured bacon, cream 
cheese and cranberry 
sauce on a toasted telera 

and only costs $7.25. The Ubehebe 
sandwich and all other sandwiches 
come with a side of potato salad.

Coffee is the most important item 
on Krakatoa’s menu, and customer 
favorites include the vanilla, mocha 
and caramel lattes despite the $3.75 
price tag. If you’re in search of some-
thing refreshing, try the pomegranate 
blood orange iced tea, which costs just 
$3.25. When in need of something 
stronger, the iced Vietnamese contains 
more caffeine than most other drinks. 
Pairing your caffeinated drink with a 

tasty dessert, such as a chocolate chip 
cookie or a muffin, is highly recom-
mended, since Krakatoa has a pastry 
bar that will get you to come back just 
to satisfy your sweet tooth. The multi-
dimensional environment of Krakatoa 

makes it a cafe that provides an ideal 
balance of social and studious — just 
what a student needs.

most family-style restaurants don’t have singles bars. Then again, Heat Bar & Kitchen isn’t 
an ordinary family-style restaurant. 
One of the newest kids on block, it’s 
all about trying to combine things in 
unexpected ways. 

Don’t be deterred by the abun-
dance of traffic cones outside the res-
taurant. They fail to convey the inner 
decor’s chic and welcoming ambiance. 
The lighting highlights your good 

side, and the food is well prepared, 
albeit pricey. But what makes a night 
at Heat is the people watching. 

The restaurant attracts an older 
crowd, from couples to co-workers to 
middle-aged, gay men hitting on the 
servers, that makes up for the long 
wait times. 

Beware of showing up late to 
your reservation on a busy weekend 
evening since tables are turned over 
quickly. However, apologetic serv-
ers will immediately seat you at the 
bar and hand you a drink list that 

serves numerous San Diegan craft 
beers. Heat definitely has a fair selec-
tion of locally brewed beer including 
Ballast Point, Coronado and Hillcrest 
Brewery. Fans of spice and unique 
beers should definitely try Ballast 
Point’s Thai Chili, Lime, Ginger 
Wahoo ($7). IPA lovers will be pleased 
to see Chaotic Double Double ($7) 
and Victory at Sea ($7). Wines from 
Argentina, Italy and California are 
standouts. Additionally, Heat’s bever-
ages range from cocktails to sake for 
those looking for something stronger.

Pass on Heat’s specials and appe-
tizers for a second helping of their 
homemade bread rolls and jars of sea 
salt infused butter. They’re free. 

An excellent pairing to the bread 
is the Thyme Roasted Chicken, which 
is paired with hearty herbed crushed 
potatoes, and side fennel salad ¬— an 
entire meal on a plate. Juicy free-range 
chicken sits in a delicious broth that 
oozes into the crushed potatoes ($17). 

For a dish that’s only found at 
this restaurant, try the signature Heat 
burger: It’s juicy, smothered with 
house-made “bacon jam,” and is noth-
ing short of awesome. Cooked medi-

um and covered with melted gruyere 
and peppery greens, this grass-fed 
burger has a pronounced kick. You 
can add egg or sautéed mushrooms to 
the burger and accompany the meal 
with freshly fried fries sided with 
ketchup and garlic aioli. This dish was 
probably the most well rounded of the 
bunch and at $12, the most affordable.

There’s food for vegetarians at 
Heat, too. An assortment of veg-
gie and grain dishes are scattered 
throughout the menu, ranging in 
price from $9 to $15. 

A word to the wise: Skip des-
sert. The highlighted item when we 
were there was a mousse made with 
smoked 70 percent dark chocolate, 
and it failed to impress. 

Heat has happy hour from 4 p.m. 
to 6:30 p.m. every day, during which 
every drink and food item on the 
menu is just $5. If you’re on a student 
budget, that’s when you’re best off 
going. Just don’t expect fast service: 
Grab a seat at the bar, and let yourself 
be entertained by the crowds.

BY Adrienne  foley Staff Writer

i ’m worried about Morrissey. The snide, charismatic and frequently self-absorbed former Smiths front-
man has been in and out of hospitals 
for most of 2013 — first with a bleed-
ing ulcer, and later with pneumonia 
in both lungs. Though I’m sure the 
53-year-old singer himself would love 
to die in grand, dramatic fashion, 
coughing up blood on stage mid-song 
like Nicole Kidman in “Moulin Rouge,” 
his doctors advised him to cancel 
his entire North American tour and 
potentially quit music for good, expe-
diting his planned 2014 retirement.

In all likelihood, good ‘ol Moz will 
be just fine. But what if he isn’t? Who, 
then, will take his place as the whiniest, 
most sexually ambiguous vegetarian in 
popular music? I’m partial to thinking 
that no one can, but we’d better get 
prepared to mourn.

Fortunately for us, Morrissey is 
obsessed with death; in fact, he pro-
nounced his own demise in a January 
31 note posted to official fan site True 
to You. 

“The reports of my death have been 
greatly understated,” he wrote. “…I am 
fully determined to resume the tour 
on February 9 at the Chelsea Ballroom 
in Las Vegas. If there’s an audience of 
any kind in attendance, I just might 
die with a smile on my face, after all. If 
I am not there, I shall probably never 
again be anywhere.”

All this morbid posturing made 
me think: Morrissey could easily 
pen his own death scene using lines 
and themes from his own songs. So, 
without further ado, I bring you “The 
Death of Morrissey by Morrissey,” a 
very short story in three parts:

There is a light That Never Goes 
out

Steven Patrick Morrissey thought it 
would be a good night to go out on the 
town. Stuck in a Royal Oak, Michigan 
hospital with a bleeding ulcer, a con-
cussion and a disorder called Barrett’s 
esophagus, the singer was itching to 
escape. He couldn’t stand being sur-
rounded by the stench of death any 
longer, so he dialed a number on his 
cell phone.

“Take me out tonight,” he whis-
pered into the phone. “I want to see 
people and I want to see life.”

Twenty minutes later, a nurse went 
to check on Morrissey after noticing 
the light was still on in his room, but 
the sick pop star was already gone.

First of the Gang to Die
As the dawn rises, there’s panic on 

the streets of Royal Oak when a group 
of petty thieves discover Morrissey’s 
body, crumpled in the back of a lim-
ousine crashed in a ditch near the 
edge of town. His bones are smashed 
against the door and the sunlight 
thrown across his face, with the driver 
nowhere to be found.

The thieves now stand under a 
nearby iron bridge. The neighbors 
gather around the scene, too, but they 
would rather not get involved. They 
didn’t know Morrissey or the Smiths, 
but they feel as if they’ve smelled the 
last 10 seconds of life.

Elsewhere, with his former band-
mates still alive, the headlines read, 
“First of the Gang to Die.”

cemetary Gates
The body will be taken back to dear 

old Blighty to be buried in Manchester 
on a dry, sunny day. As the funeral pro-
cession makes its way past Morrissey’s 
favorite pub and the local church, his 
loved ones will talk about how he 
made their lives precious — how he 
stole so many hearts away.

And everyone will say how he 
was too young to die; yet Morrissey 
requested his tombstone read “Life is 
very long when you’re lonely.” 

How to 
Kill This 
Charming 
Man

Directed by  Fede Alvarez
Starring Jane Levy,  Shiloh Fernandez
rated R
release Date April 5th

t he dead rise again. Fede Alvarez’s “Evil Dead” dishes out a sumptuous blend of suspense, 
gore, and dark humor in his remake 
of Sam Raimi’s horror-comedy cult 
classics. In an age where main-
stream horror movies have become 
either pseudo-intelligent moments 
of suspense or campy torture-sex 
flicks, “Evil Dead” is a much needed 
breath of stale, death-filled air. 

A group of five young adults 
head out to a cabin in the woods 
where they used to spend their 
summers. In addition to spread-
ing the ashes of Mia and David’s 
(Jane Levy, “Shameless” and Shiloh 
Fernandez, “Red Riding Hood”) 
recently deceased mother, the gang 
is there to righteously help Mia kick 
her drug addiction.

As the gang clean up their abode, 
they discover dead cats in the base-
ment strung up like macabre party 
streamers (seemingly for no reason 
other than to creep everyone out). 
They also find a book. 

Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci, 
“Beginners”) decides, on a whim, 
to tear open the black plastic and 
barbed wire that cover the book. 
Ignoring all the vehement warnings 
written directly on the pages biding 
him to stop, Eric goes out of his way 
to recite the forbidden incantation, 
effectively conjuring a demon that 
possesses Mia and dooms them all. 
For the rest of the film, Eric is ironi-
cally the voice of reason (though 
he really has no place to speak) as 
he repeatedly tells David that Mia’s 
death is the only way to end the 

bloodbath.
The film paces itself almost per-

fectly, beginning with a pivotal evil 
tree scene that pays homage to the 
original “Evil Dead” and “Evil Dead 
II.” Of course, only Mia experiences 
the horror and because she is a 
young drug addict going through 
withdrawals and prone to the dra-
matic, no one believes her about the 
evil thing in the woods that is now 
in the cabin with them.

While the obvious cataclysms 
occur, they’re intensified tenfold by 
surprises worse than could be imag-

ined. No opportunity for violence or 
gore is spared and no sharp object 
goes neglected; all doors are open 
and then promptly locked shut by 
the evil spirit. One can only specu-
late how many small truck-loads of 
fake blood were utilized in the mak-
ing of this film.

But the gore is not the only 
thing (though it may be the best). 
“Evil Dead” is a trifecta of suspense, 
gore, and shock; only one hand is 
needed to count the number of sur-
prise shots in the film. Rather, “Evil 
Dead” relies on its creepy score, Jane 

Levy’s fantastic acting, and it’s bru-
tal slicing and dicing to deliver its 
punch. It knows full well the audi-
ence is entranced, watching every 
move, anticipating scrupulously 
what limb will be sheared or if they 
really will go down into the forsaken 
basement.

If you love horror movies, “Evil 
Dead” 2013 is a must-see movie that 
will only leave you thirsty for more.

F or a band as low-key as Hem, seven years is much too long to go without releasing another 
album. Even after winning a Drama 
Desk Award for its compositions 
in a production of “Twelfth Night” 

starring Anne Hathaway, the band 
kept up its lengthy hiatus until now. 
The result of this standstill is not, 
however, a drastic departure from 
the band’s usual fare of melancholy 
indie folk. Instead, “Departure and 

Farewell” continues Hem’s tradition 
of gentle, warm melodies, a perfect 
musical helpmate for the band’s sig-
nature literate lyrics.

Though Hem has promised that 
the album won’t be their last, it’s 
difficult not to see “Departure and 
Farewell” as an ode to goodbyes. 
The album begins with an epony-
mous track with lead singer Sally 
Ellyson — the vocal doppelganger 
of whimsical artist Rosie Thomas 
— repeating the verse, “And I am 
gone... / So long, my love.” The 
theme carries on even in the album’s 
true standout “Tourniquet,” with 
its visual poetry echoing the band’s 
period of inactivity: “Oh Brooklyn, 
your bridges are bound up in light/ 

Every artery’s clogged as you pull the 
belt tight/ And this tourniquet turns 
even tighter until/ .../ We come to a 
standstill.”

Unfortunately, the quiet, idyllic 
beauty of Hem’s music and lyrics in 
“Departure and Farewell” gets quite 
repetitious. Too often, its tracks 
sound like mere variations of one 
another, though perhaps for this rea-
son, it is the perfect album to wind 
down a busy day. Nonetheless, it is a 
great place for Hem to wave goodbye 
to its hiatus and say hello to writing 
more tunes — perhaps ones bolder 
than their usual fare.

—   Jacqueline  kim

Picking up where he left off in 2006, Hem returns 
with more quaint folk tunes.

halcyon days By Christie Yi leTTer  To  The  edITor

Dear Editor,
Jeffrey Kwong’s Letter to the 

Editor on March 13 is misleading 
and contains false information in its 
analysis of the University Centers Fee 
Referendum. I will accurately respond 
to the points he raised.

Naturally, all fee increases are 
initially perceived with skepticism. It 
is our duty as paying students to edu-
cate ourselves on all fees that affect us. 
While Kwong’s concern is healthy and 
appreciated, his points are misguided.

Yes, the Che Cafe does have low 
rent. Take into account the facts: It is 
recognized as a non-profit at the state 
level, it is student-run, and its loca-
tion is nearly a satellite site of UCSD. 
Can you say you walk past the Che 
Cafe on a daily basis?

On the topic of vendors, UCEN 
does not charge them simply “based 
on a percentage of their gross 
receipts.” Vendors pay a market-based 
rent or a rent based on their percent-
age of sales — whichever is higher. 
The effect of increasing vendor rent 
would trickle down to students in 
that menu prices would rise, and we 
would have to pay more for meals.

Kwong’s article hints at the lack of 
necessity for the student-run coopera-
tives and the Crafts Center. He wants 
us to ask ourselves, “When was the 
last time I went to the co-op?” My 
answer is yesterday. These services 
help students find community, nour-
ishment, creativity and more. Sure, 
they aren’t utilized by every student, 
but what service is? I wouldn’t be 
affected by the loss of the Women’s 
Center, but that doesn’t mean I don’t 
see it as an essential service.

While there have been debts 
accruing from the cooperatives, 
University Centers Advisory Board, 
GSA, A.S. and the Coops are in the 

process of rewriting the Master Space 
Agreement that the coops must abide 
by. In addition, UCAB has set a new 
rent structure for the three coops 
housed in the Student Center and is 
discussing a debt-repayment plan. 
With a new MSA and rent structure 
in place, we hope that rent payment 
will no longer be an issue. With turn-
over of members in all the parties 
involved, we (councils, cooperatives, 
board members) are the group that is 
appropriately addressing the problems 
of debt, lack of communication and 
accountability. We are setting a new 
precedent to be followed for years to 
come in the hope that problems we 
are currently facing are avoided. 

This fee increase prevents: dete-
rioration, cuts to services, reduction 
in concerts and events, conversion 
of student space to retail space and 
decreased student employment. It 
ensures: the execution of needed 
maintenance, funding towards the 
Crafts Center, retention of computer 
labs, low to free rates for meeting 
rooms and AV equipment and con-
tinued hours of operation that we 
currently have.

Senior, Muir College

UCAB Fee Increase Not 
Tied to Corporate Welfare 

on campus seems to be that students 
support this expensive yet important 
tradition that serves almost as an ini-
tiation for freshmen each year. 

ASCE did not disclose exactly 
how much it cost them to get Lamar 
to perform on the coveted RIMAC 
stage, but frankly, we couldn’t care 
less. Their choice of artist is the 
perfect combination of fresh and 
popular. His first major label debut 
album, “good kid, m.A.A.d city,” 
received widespread attention when 
his two songs, “Swimming Pools 
(Drank)” and “Poetic Justice,” made 
the Top 40 charts, but it’s the narra-
tive of the album that draws listeners 
in by the fire to hear more. 

ASCE deserves credit for the 

thematic choice in up-and-coming 
artists. In recent years, Tritons have 
gotten to see Macklemore and Ryan 
Lewis, Wiz Khalifa and Drake all 
before they really made it big. Lamar 
falls in line with this trend, and the 
student population seems to be far 
more enthusiastic about this year’s 
headliner than those of years past, 
despite the presence of lesser-known 
supporting acts. The primary fac-
tor behind the success of this lineup 
seems to be the student survey that 
ASCE sent out earlier this year. With 
around 2,000 student responses 
submitted, ASCE was able to get an 
adequate sample that showed that 
UCSD students want to see a Top 
40 artist performing on any Triton’s 
favorite day of the year. As much 
as we appreciate indie music at the 

Guardian, we know that it’s dirty 
radio rap without the censors that 
pairs well with being wasted, not 
Wilco. 

It’s unfortunate that guest ticket 
prices have risen by $5 this year, but 
the increase was implemented by 
the UCSD Box Office, not by ASCE. 
This won’t to stop anyone from buy-
ing $65 guest tickets, and if anything, 
the extra $5 is worth being able to 
purchase tickets online instead of 
waiting in the endless lines at Price 
Center, as we all did in earlier years.

With Tyler the Creator playing 
at Porter’s Pub this coming Sunday 
and Armin van Buuren at RIMAC in 
May, this is already a great quarter 
for live music, and the Sun God line-
up is that extra push that we need to 
finish off the year.

A two-run home run from senior Richard 
Siegel generated the only runs for UCSD in its 
nonconference bout against Point Loma Naza-
rene University last Tuesday, April 2.

In the top of the third inning, with two outs, 
freshman Troy Cruz singled up the middle. Cruz 
was brought home on Siegel’s homer, who went 
2-for-3 at the plate.

From there, UCSD went stale. The Tritons 
recorded just two hits in their remaining six in-
nings, giving Point Loma ample time to gap the 
deficit. The Sea Lions tied the score in the fifth 
inning, hitting junior right-hander Sean Rowan 
up for two runs on three hits in Rowan’s only in-
ning pitched of the game.

UCSD head coach Eric Newman cycled 
through six different slingers in search of sta-
bility against the Sea Lions. San Diego native, 

freshman Adrian Orozco logged a solid three 
innings, allowing two hits. Sophomore Chad Ri-
eser recorded the loss.

The Tritons return to conference play this 
Friday, April 5 to Sunday, April 7 against Cal 
State San Bernardino.

Eberts Hits 
1,000 Career Killsphoto by bRIAN yIp /GuARdIAN FILE

Last Sunday, March 31 against UC Irvine, senior outside hitter Carl 
Eberts became the fifth Triton to crack 1,000 career kills. The fifth-year 
mechanical engineering major has 1,002 kills with four games remain-
ing in the regular season.

In 2012, team co-captain Eberts earned All-Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation honorable mention. Eberts started all 28 matches and was 
also named team MVP.

As the most senior member of the squad in 2013, Eberts has only im-
proved his game over the course of UCSD’s 25 games. Not only does the 
tri-captain lead the Tritons with 252 kills on the season; he also boasts 
121 digs, second only to UCSD libero Chase Frishman.

The No. 17 UCSD women’s water polo team’s eight-game win-ning streak came to an end last week at the Hawaii Spring Break Tournament held March 28 to March 30 in Honolulu, 
Hawaii.

The Tritons fell to NCAA Division I opponents to No. 6 San Diego 
State 5–9, No. 2 Stanford 4–17, No. 8 University of Hawaii 6–9 and 
No. 17 UC Santa Barbara 9–12. Junior captain Sarah Lizotte, a 2012 
All-American, was UCSD’s top scorer at the tournament, slating seven 
goals in the four matches. She was buttressed by consistent play from 
junior center Melissa Bartow and sophomore attacker Rachel Brooks, 
who both scored three goals apiece at the invitational.

Defensively, freshman goalkeeper Courtney Miller — earning 216 
saves this season, the most in the WWPA — got put to the test. Miller 
picked up 25 saves over last week’s affair. 

“The teams we saw in Hawaii were all top teams,” Lizotte said. “And 
so when you play teams of that caliber, it’s always hard to stay moti-
vated for the whole game and keep that spirit and positive attitude 
up. We struggled mentally and let the game get away with us at times, 
but I don’t think we performed horribly. Overall, we hung in there for 
three of the four games, but there are still a lot of little things that we 
need to work on.”

 After four straight losses, the Tritons have fallen two spots in the 
national standings. However, UCSD remains in second place in the 
Western Water Polo Association. With a 14–12 record (3–0 in the 
WWPA), for a schedule that Lizotte stresses was planned to be par-
ticularly rigorous, the Tritons sit well behind first place Loyola Mary-
mount University (15–7 overall, 6–1 in the WWPA).

“We need to go 4–0 against our conference opponents this week-
end,” Lizotte said. “If we leave that tournament with good results, it 
will really help us going into the conference tournament.”

UCSD returns to WWPA play this weekend at the Santa Clara 
Bronco Invitational, April 6 to April 7. The Tritons will face Colorado 
State University and Sonoma State in the opening day. On April 7, 
UCSD takes on Cal State Monterey Bay and Cal State East Bay.

When asked where Lizotte would like to see improvement in the 
pool, the junior pointed to UCSD’s five-man defense.

“I think one of the biggest areas of improvement that needs to be 
addressed is the five-man defense, or man-down defense,” Lizotte said. 
“This past weekend, we didn’t play our best man-down defense, and 
we definitely paid for it. Going forward, I definitely think that’s some-
thing we need to work on, and something we might be working on in 
practice this week as well.”
