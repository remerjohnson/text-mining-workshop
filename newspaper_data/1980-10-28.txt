AS releases 
new 1980 
funding list 

BY MARTI WARD 
After numerous revisions 

a nd much debate, the 
Associated Students Council 
released their unanimously 
approved student organiza-
tions budget yesterday. 

"This is an absolutely 
bare-boned budget ," said AS 
Vice President Warren 
Wheeler. A total of $15,849 is 
allocated for programming 
for the 55 organizations that 
applied for budget money. 
Another $4,116 is set aside 
for their operating expenses. 

This round of student 
organization funding will 
dispense with just part of the . 
projected $60,000 student 
organization budget for the 
year . According to AS 
President Bill Topkis, some 
of that money was allocated 
during last quater's budget 
hearings, while some is being 
saved for future use. 

Topkis called this year's 
AS budgeting "austere," 
adding that part of the AS 
money shortage may have 
been caused by an excess of 
student organization funding 
during spring quarter. 

But the problem is 
temporary, he said, because

cancer. It is also the T-cells 
which reject transplanted 
organs and cause a skin 
reaction when a person is 
exposed to a tuberculosis 
extract in a TB test. 

For an unknown reason, 
most cancer patients have 
either a low level of T-cells or 
their T-cells are deficient in 
some way which prevent 
them from attacking tumors. 

However, preliminary tests 
have shown that when 
cancer patients were given 
thymosin , their T -cell s 
reached near-normal levels. 
In addition, those who 
received thymosin and

Physics prof Matthias 
dies, leaves 'heritage' 

UCSD physics Professor 
Bernd Matthias died 
yesterday morning in his La 
Jolla home. He was 62. 

Born June 8, 1980 in West 
Germany, Matthias had 
been a professor of physics 
at UCSD since 1961 and 
director of the Institute of 
Pure and Applied Physical 
Science since 1971. He had 
ooncurrently been a staff 
member of the Bell 
Telephone Laboratory since 
]948. 

Matthias received his 
doctorate from the Federal 
Institute of Technology in 
Zurich, Switzerland in 1943. 
He pecialized in the 
physics of matter at very 
low temperatures and was a 
world authority on the 
phenomenon of supercon-

ductivity in which at 
sufficiently low temper-
atures many metals loose all 
electrical resistance and 
carry currents with no 
energy loss whatever. 

Matthias is credited with 
having discovered most of 
the superconducting 
materials known today , 
including many upon which 
such new technologie as 
controlled thermonuclear 
fusion depend. 

He made equally import-
antly contributions to 
understand the phenome-
non of ferro-electricity in 
which materia]s exhibit an 
electical equivalent of 
magnetic behavior.

Election rally draws 
crowd for debate 
Kapiloff also makes speech 

BY PETER MORTENSEN 
New8 Editor 

Representatives from four 
presidential campaigns 
debated their candidates' 
issues during a League of 
Student Voters forum on the 
Main Gym steps yesterday 
afternoon. 

Speakers on behalf of 
Independent John Anderson, 
Democrat Jimmy Carter, the 
Citizen 's Party 's Barry 
Commoner and Republican 
Ronald Reagan took turns 
criticizing their opponents' 
stands on such issues as the 
Equal Rights Amendment, 
registration for the draft and 
air pollution. 

Larry Kapiloff, state 
assemblyman from the 78th 
district , also was on hand to 
offer his opinions on the 
issues, including his views on 
the Reagan candidacy. 

He told the crowd of about 
200 gathered on the Student 
Center hump that air 
pollution "is a lot more 
important is ue than any 
other issue I could raise in 
this campaign." 

"When Ronald Reagan said 
that we should somehow 
back away from our 
commitment to air quality, 
and somehow balance the 
ledger with economic 
interests, I think you could 
cut open his head and find 
nothing but a hole inside." 
Kapi]off said. 

Kapiloff continued to 
lambast Reagan , saying, "I 
served under Ronald Reagan 
when I was in my first two 
years in the legislature, and I 
don 't want him as president. 
He 's a very dangerou s 
man ... he's dumb and he's 
lazy." 

Bob Wil son. incumbent 
Democratic congressional 
candidate from the 41st 
congress ional di trict was 
al 0 cheduled to peak, but 

he failed to show for the rally. 
Dave Brin, LSV chairman, 

said that Clair Buqtener, 
43rd congressional dIstrict 
incumbent. delicined an 
invitation to appear 
yesterday. He added that 
KKK Grand Dragon Tom 
Metzger, Burgener's demo-
cratic opponent, was not 
invited to speak. 

During the first mock-
presidential debate, repre-
sentatives of Anderson, 
Carter and Reagan each gave 
four-minute "constructive" 
arguments in favor of their 
candidates. Following th;~ 
each speaker gave 1 two-
minute rebuttal statement. 

A similar debate including 
representatives of Carter, 
Anderson and Commoner 
followed Kapiloff's speech.

Efforts to holt fail 
Third World terrorism is 
played out on American soil 

Speak up!!! 
Our opinion page wants you.

New York - On Sept. 11, 
the Cuban exile group that 
calls itself Omega 7 escalated 
its level of anti-Castro 
terrorism in the United 
States to new heights by 
killing a Cuban diplomat in 
broad daylight as he drove 
along a busy street in New 
York City. 

The assassination - the 
first of • UN diplomat on US 
BOil - w. brutal, but it was 
also symbolic. Anyone who 
had followed the history of 
terrorism in the US in the 
last half dozen years realized 
that the date was chosen as 
carefully as the tareel. The 
murder took place on the 
seventh annivenary of the 
overthrow of Chilean 
Marxist president Salvador 
Allende. 

The FBI made a great deal 
of the obvious fact that 
Orne,. 7 had become 
emboldened enoulh to go 
after • diplomat. But it did 
not, of course, mention its sad 
J'MlI"d of failure in trying to 
stem an escalating wave of 
Third World boodlet tine on 
US soil. 

The tempo of terrorism has 
been rising in recent years. 
The neo-Nazi Croation 
nationalists have left a 
bloody wake with their pipe 
bombs in post offices and 
airports. And since 1976, 
there have been two political 
murders in Wash~on DC 
- the one world caPItal that 
always considered itself 
immune from this kind of 
nasty business. In that year, 
Orlando Letelier, the former 
Chilean ambassador to the 

Jol", e .. ",,,,i,,,., a New 
Y or. jotInuziisl, wro" I,.is for 
1M Ptlci{1C NftIJS Snviu. 

US, was murdered with a 
bomb in downtown Washing-
ton. And last July, a former 
Iranian diplomat was killed 
in the Washington suburb of 
Bethesda by assassins 
reportedly in the employ of 
the Khomeini regime. 

But the most endemic 
terror problem has been the 
fanatic Cuban exiles - many 
of whom received support 
from the US government in 
the early 19605. 

Recent J>ublic assertions 
that the FBI is ¢ving "top 
priority" to rootIng out the 
terrorists has been greeted 
with what can kindly be 
described as skepticism. 
Concerned Cuban exile 
groups, upon whom the 
Cuban terrorists usually 
prey, consider the federal 
pohcy to be one of benign 
neglect. The killing of a 
diplom~t an~ t~ bom bing _of 
a RUSSWl mIssIon to the UN 
last December are but a 
fraction of the Cuban exile 
terrorism during the past 
decade - terrorism that 
includes nine murders or 
attempted murders and 
hundreds of incidents of 
violence and bombing. Even 
the FBI alfke in Miami was 
bombed and, after fow: years, 
that case has not been solved. 

The failure to act or the 
lack of any meaningful 
federal commitment to stop 
this kind of violence becomes 
even more difficult to 
understand when federal 
agencies insist they have 
known for years who is 
behind Omega 7. 

Jerome Sanford, a former 
federal prosecutor in Miami , 
tried for three years to get his 
superiors in Washington to 
undertake a major effort

What is happening with the billions

officials are often in closer touch with the 
actual consequences of the programs. 

"I'!'l not s!lre that there's anything that 
foreIgn asSIstance can accomplish in 
Bangladesh," says Susan McCord, director of 
the small Quaker Service or/pnization. "We're 
thinking about pulling out. 

The reason for this pessimism is that things 
have gotten worse rather than better in the 
decade or so since the world adopted 
Bangladesh as its orphan. Bangladesh is the 
only major country in Asia where the average 
income has been decreasing, though the 
income of the small class of the well-to-do has 
been rising rapidly. 

In the period from 1962 to 1976, food intake 
decreased by nine percent - a single vegetable 
and an occassional fish supplement the basic 
diet of rice. Landlessness has increased 
annually to the point where more than half the 
farmers in Bangladesh either have no land or 
less than half an acre. 

The principal bone of rontention in the aid 
community has been food grants. Since 1972 
foreign nations have sent more than 10 million 
tons of food to Bangladesh; the United States 
Agency for International Development (AID) 
alone gave more than half a million tonsoffood 
in loans and grants in 1979-80. 

Where does all this wheat, rice and edible oil 
go? The bulk of the food aid, in Bangladesh as 
elsewhere in the world, is given to the 
government to distribute as it sees fit. In 
Bangladesh the food is distributed through a 
ration system to the military, which has 
retained power since a 1975 coup, the police, the 
civil service and the urban middle class. Only 
one-third oft he total is even earmarked for the 
90 percent of the nation which works the land 
and a great deal less than that - perhaps 10 
percent of the total ration supply - actually 
gets to them. The remainder is siphoned off by 
local, regional and national government 
officials. 

"We have gone to Zia <president Aizur 
Rahman) a number of times to ask him to 
change the ration system," says World Food 
Program director Trevor Page. "but he has

were sold to rover "expenses" and the 
remaining 33 tons were simply unaccounted 
for. "Resources intended for 'development' ... 
rarely reach the poor," the study concluded. 
"In fact it is suprising if anything reaches the 
poor at all." 

The food program's advocates argue that 
half a loaf is better than none. "Without this 
food therewould certainly be mass starvation," 
explained a lecturer at the University of Dacca. 

The argument over food, as well as that over 
"developmental" aid, uItimatley comes to 
ideology: As Bangladesh's aid treasure goes 
skittering off course into the hands of the 
middle class and the rural elite, donors have 
begun to ask whether the good done not only by 
food, but also by tubewells and roads and 
textbooks, is greater than the harm done by 
reinforcing a thoroughly unjust social and 
economic system. 
. Van Nimmen, deputy director of the World 

Bank, agrees that an increase in landlessness, 
and possibly unemployment, "may be one of 
the consequences" of the Bank'~ massive loan 

The good is distributed to 
the military, the police, the 
civil service and the urban 
middle class 
commItment lor tubewells, fertilizer, flood 
control barriers and the like. But Nimmen 
states that "that's no reason not to go ahead 
with our attempts to increase productivity ." 

The Bank is providing Bangladesh with $250 
million in soft loans this year, up from $139 
million only two years ago. The Bank is 
particularly satisfied with program 
implementation," says Nimmen, and plans on 
significantly greater commitments in the near 
future. 

Nimmen admits that the Bank has "no 
control" over its projects, which are handed 
over to the government for administration. 
The Bank employs only 10 full-time staff 
members .. all of them foreign, all of them 
located in Dacca. Projects are generally 
inspected once a year .

Castro releases US 
prisoners from Cuba 

MIAMI - Thirty Ameri-
can prisoners pardoned by 
Fidel Castro on charges that 
included hijacking and drug-
smuggling left Cuba 
yesterday and were flown to 
the United States, where 
they were greeted by tearful 
and jubilant friends and 
relatives. 

About 200 people waved 
U.S. flags and cheered as the 

chartered Air Force Boeing 
737 arrived from Havana at 
Tamiamj Airport in Miami. 
The Americans had been 
jailed for terms ranging from 
months up to 11 years. 

"He looks so great to us. 
He's home. He's home," 
shouted Earl Dacus of 
Jonesboro, Ark., as he and his 
wife hugged their son, John. 
He was arrested April 28, 
1978, on drug and immigra-
tion charges. 

The Cuban government 
announced Oct. 13 that aU 
u.s. prisoners would be 
released in response to 
appeals from rongressmen, 
social organizations and 
relatives of the prisoners. 
Diplomatic sources specula-
ted the move was another in a

gestures by Cuba . 

In September, the Cubans 
abruptly closed Mariel 
harbor to "Freedom Flotilla" 

Sponges not 
so 'natural' 

IOWA CITY, Iowa, -
Sales of natural sea sponges 
as an alternative to tampons 
were suspended yesterday 
after state researchers said 
they contain sand, bacteria 
and other potentially 
harmful substances, a 
spokeswoman for a women's 
clinic said. 

Dr. Adel Franks, of the 
Emma Goldman Clinic for 
Women in Iowa city, said 
sales will be discontinued 
until more information is 
gathered about potential 
health hazards. 

That decision came after 
Dr. William Hausler, director 
of the State Hygenic 
Laboratory, said the sponges 
pose a potential health risk to 
menstruating women. 

The sponges have been 
mentioned as an alternative 
to tampons, which federal 
health officials have linked to 
Toxic Shock Syndrome, a 
rare but sometimes fatal 
disease.

boats that had ferried more 
than 125,000 illegal refugees 
to the United states, and the 
Cubans also helped undercut 
a spate of hijackings by 
returning two suspects to the 
United States to face charges. 

The new freedom was 
short-lived for some of the 
returnees. A U.S. marshal at 
the scene said it wasn't 
known whether any of the 
Cuban charges against the 
men will be prosecuted in 
U.S. courts, but he said 
alleged hijackers would face 
charges here. 

Three other freed men 
chose not to return because 
they face charges in the 
Umted States. They were 
identified in Cuba only as 
Charles Hill, Jeffrey 10hn 
Hoban and Lester Perry . 

During the flight from 
Cuba, the returnees were 
kept in handcuffs and 
accompanied by 10 marshals 
because "some of these guys 
are experienced hijackers," 
said a diplomat at the U.S. 
Interests Section of the Swiss 
Embassy in Havana. 

Debate may 
be boring 

WASHINGTON -
When President Carter and 
Ronald Reagan meet in 
Cleveland tonight their 
showdown debate is likely to 
stick to familiar themes: war 
and taxes, energy and the 
economy and the role of 
government in American life. 

For once in the 1980 
campaign, the two rivals will 
stand a few feet from each 
~her as they spell out their 
differences. Barring a slip of 
the tongue in reponse to a 
9uesti.on, the strongest 

Imprss~on they are likely to 
leave IS a sense of their 
personalities. 

If it's high drama 
Americans are expecting 
from the ndlionally broad· 
cast debate, they probably 
will have to settle for the 
chance that the candidates 
will use some oft hei r harsher 
campaign lines. 

Will Carter fix Reagan 
with a cold stare and call the 
Republican nominee "extra-
ordinarily naive" in his hope 
to renegotiate an arms 
control treaty with the 
Soviets? Will Carter describe 
Reagan's tax cut Dian as 
"voodoo economics"1 ·

and, in tones of outrage call 
Carter's economic record one

history"? Will he accuse 
Cater of being "incompe-

BELFAST, Northern 
Ireland - Uneven convicted 
Irish Republican Army 
guerrillas yesterday launch-
ed a hunger strike "to the 
death" in Northern Ireland's 
Maze Prison in a bid to force 
the British government to 
recognizejaiJed IRA members 
as political prisoners. 

The British have declared 
they will not "surrender to 
blackmail" and are prepared 
to let the hunger strikers die. 

Officials of Sinp Fein 
politiCal front of tKe IRA's 
Provisional wing, said about 
30 IRA women activists in 
prison in Armagh might join 
the hunger strike by the 
seven men. 

Authorities fear such 
action would heighten the 
emotional impact of the 
hunger strike and might 
touch off renewed bloodshed 
in Northern Ireland, torn for 
11 years by sectarian feuding

of the faculty's strong

dead at 62 
continued from pal(e 1 
world_ He was elected to the 
National Academy of 
Sciences and the American 
Academy of Arts and 
Sciences in 1965, was elected 
industrial research man of 
the year in 1968, and in 1970 
received the prestigious 
Oliver E. Buckley prize in 
solid state physics. He was 
awarded an honorary doctor 
of science degree from the 
University of Lausanne in 
1978, and in 1979 won the 
American Physical Society 
International Prize for new 
materials. 

Professor Matthias' 
laboratory at UCSD has been 
a major center for low 
temperature research and 
has attracted as visitors and 
collaborators many of the 
most important scientists in 
this field_ Matthias was 
known especially for having 
an intuitive grasp of the 
physics of atomic behavior in 
solids that led him rapidly to 
discoveries that would 
otherwise have been slowly 
arrived at. 

Upon learning of Mattias' 
death, Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson issued a statement 
saying, "Bernd Matthias was 
a major figure on t his campus 
and in the world of solid state 
physics. His contributions to 
science were extensive and 
profound, and he has left us 
with a heritage of outstand-
ing achievement."

of the University's instruc-
tional improvement funds; 

- Increased efforts to 
encourage more interaction 
between faculty & students. 
The Regents have approved 
Saxon's recommendation ' 
that $500,000 be set aside to 
support these efforts. 

The report of the 
University-wide Task Force 
on Teaching Evaluation, 
chaired by David L_ Outcalt, 
former dean of instructional 
development and professor of 
mathematics at U.C. Santa 
Barbara. was distributed to 
all the campuses earlier this 
year. The findings of the 
Task Force, based on May 
1979 surveys of U_C. faculty 
and department chairman, 
indicate: 

- Faculty at all ranks in 
all disciplines on all UC 
campuses believe teaching 
should be given significantly 
more weight in academic 
personnel decisions involving 
promotions and salary 
IOcreases. Faculty feel that 
teaching should be given 
more weight and research 
less in these decisions. 

-Faculty support contin-
ued use of student end-of-
murse evaluations (CAPE)-
so long as these evaluations 
do not constitute the only 
source of information about 
teaching effectiveness in

in Camelot. I tried to pull 
together a lot of good men, a 
lot of good people in a round 
table so that we could work 
for one common end. I feel in 
a sense betrayed, because 
there were others who felt I 
should not have the 
information I needed." 

Street-level FBI agents 
privately tell the same story, 
I.e; do local law enforcement 
offlCers. "We all have trouble 
with the feds," says one New 
York City police official. 
"And without them we can't 
solve cases like this (the 
Cuban diplomat's murder). 
All we can do is go through 
the motions and build pa~r 
palaces with our reports.'

personnel files. 

-Faculty strongly support 
a broad variety of ways in 
which the quality of their 
instruction can be assessed 
by colleagues. 

The impetus for a task 
force on teaching evaluation 
came in May, 1976, when a 
request for such a study was 
made to Saxon by the 
Student Body Presidents' 
Council and the Academic 
Council of the UC Academic 
Senate. Formation of the 
University-wide task force 
was formally approved by 
Saxon in 1977, and members 
from all campuses were

appointed in November, 1977. 
Interviews with key 

personnel on the nine 
campuses conducted by 
members of the task force 
revealed that documented 
evidence of teaching in the 
personnel process now relies 
almost exclusively on 
student end -of -course 
evaluations. The subsequent 
surveys found that 58 
percent of faculty think too 
great a reliance is placed on 
these evaluations. 

Campus respondents 
almost without exception 
saw an increased emphasis 
on the role of teaching the 
past few years. This 
heighteneci emphasis was 
attributed to increased 
student demands that began 
in the late 1960s; external 
political pressure; the 
University 's instructional

improvement program, and 
internal administrative 
directives, especially a 1969 
memorandum by then-UC-
President Charles j. Hitch. 
Among other things, the 
Hitch memorandum made 
the solicitation of evaluations 
from current students a 
requirement in the academic 
personnel review process. 

Using the expertise of a 
technical subcommittee 
composed of authorities on 
teaching evaluation, the task 
force conducted surveys of 11 
tenured faculty and depart-
ment chairpersons in May 
1979. The final response rate 
was 64 percent for faculty, or 
4,468 surveys returned, and 
79 percent for chairpersons 
or 366 surveys returned. 

Faculty were asked in the 
surveys to assess the weight 
they believe is now assigned

review process as opposed to 
the weight they feel it should 
be given. 

funding

much of the overspent money 
will return to the AS in the 
form of unused underwrites. 

Activity Fee Board 
chairman Todd Thompson 
says that enough money has 
been left in the budget to fund 
student organizations as 
their needs arise during the 
rest of the year. 

The final budget is geared 
toward reducing operating 
expenses and increasing 
money spent on actual 
ogranization programming, 
Wheeler said.
