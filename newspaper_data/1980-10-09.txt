Citizens Party Presidential Candidate, Barry Commoner 

Citizens Party at UCSD 
Commoner gains support from students 

BY JOHN BRICE 
Barry Commoner, Citizens Party 

candidate for president, believes there 
should be a swift halt to nuclear power and a 
new commitment to solar and other 
renewable energy sources. He also supports 
a non-intervention foreign policy for the 
United States. 

Commoner is the latest addition to 
presidential candidates supported by 
student groups on campus. 

Headed by UCSD sttIdent's Steve Ro s 
a~d. Austin Gallaher. the recently-formed 
Cltlze~s Party Students Organizing 
CommIttee, plans to begin promoting its 
candidate Monday on Revelle Plaza. A oot-
luck dinner, complete with a video tape of a 
recent Commoner speech, has been 
scheduled for October 14 at the Coffee Hut to 
generate support for Commoner and his 
running mate, La Donna Harris. 

Both Gallaher and Roberts were primarily 
attracted to the Citizens Party by it stance 
on energy and economic issues. 

"The thing that really sold me on the 
Citizen Party was the fact that Barry 
Commoner has an understanding of what 
appropriate technology such as solar, wind, 
and gasahol reRresents as a force for 
political change, said Gallaher. He added 
that the Democrats "offered nothing I could 
support." 

Commoner, 63 year old environmental. 
scientist and author of six books, recently 
outline his party's platform before a crowd 
of 200 at San Diego State University_ 

"We in the Citizens Party are convinced 
that nearly every serious problem we have 
arises out of the control that big 
corporations have over the economy," said 
Commoner, adding that the actions of the 
auto, oil and arms industries are specifically 
to blame. 

"Cor~rations use a single criteria, 
maximIZing their own profits, to decide 

_ what t9 AQ,'~ saip C,Qmmo er ... 
of the people must come before prOfits. 

"Does it make sense to have the lives of 
the peple of this country, the stability of the 
American economy, determined by the 
intention of certain executives to get 
themselves promoted?" asked Commoner at 
SDSU. 

Commoner su~ested this has long been 
corporate policy In the auto and oil industry. 

"A design decision made by the auto 
industry gave us smog, wasted fuel and 
serious economic problems in this major 
industry," said Commoner, citing the fact 
that larger cars which bring in larger profits 
are responsible for these problems. 

Commoner believes that a similar profit 
motivation caused the oil companies to cut 
back "about 70 percent" in domestic oil 
exploration, beginning in 1975. 

Oil companies ~ent abroad to raise their 
profits, said Commoner. 

Commoner attacked President Carter, 
Ronald Reagan and John Anderson at SDSU 
for neither recognizing nor presenting viable

AS debates appointments 
BY DEAN HAAS 

'The AS Council dealt with 
several commissioner 
appointments last night, 
approving four, but rejecting 
the recommendation of Seth 
Munter as commissioner of 
communications after a 
volatile debate. 

The Council approved 
without hesitation the 
appointments of Barry 
Hyman to the Committee on 
Educational Policy (CEP), 
Dorann Banks to the CEP's 
subcommittee on grade 
appeals, and Diane Brighton 
as AS Commmissioner of 
Public Relations. But the 
Council haggled over its 
appointment to the Reg Fee 
Commmittee and its 
selection of a new commis-
ioner of communications. 

The debate over the 
selection of a new AS 
commissioner of communica-
tions centered on a Council 
committee's recommenda-
tion of Seth Munter for the 
position. After the AS heard 
comments from Munter and 
his chief rival for the job, 
Paul Jurczak, council 
members voted 7·5 to reject 
the committee reccommenda· 
tion. 

Council members ques-
tioned the two candidates for 
over 30 minutes prior to their 
decision. Munter's lack of 
work with campus media 
and Jurczak's possible 
conflict of intere t due to his 
involvement with several 
campus pu blications, were of 
specific concern to the AS. 

Topkis was critical of the 

Council's rejection of 
Munter. 

"When time is spent (by a 
committee) in an interview 
process, the Council should 
respect it," Topki said. He 
labeled the Council's action 
"hypocritical" as it went 
against at'! interview process 
the Council has traditionally 
supported. 

Clara Chang was finally 
approved as AS representa-
tive to the Reg Fee Committee 
with the stipulation that 
Hyman be appointed as an 
alternate. Cathy Valerio, Reg 
Fee Chairwoman, stated that 
the Council' action was "net 
acceptable" because it 
violates t he Reg Fee 
Committee's by-law.

Cline attempts 
cure for disease 
UCLA doctor tries genetic 
engineering for first time on man 

LOS ANGELES -
Genetic . engineering wa 
used on humans for the first 
time, as far as is known , by a 
UCLA doctor who tried to 
cure a fatal inherited blood 
disea e by adding a new gene 
to the living cell of two 
patient , university official 
said yesterday. 

The historic -and contro-
versial procedure was carried 
out in Israel and Italy by Dr. 
Martin]. Cline. It was met 
with official concern that he 
was moving too quickly from 
the animal experiments that 
won scientific praise last 
April. 

The re u Its of the 
procedure were reportedly 
Inconclusive. After three 
months there was no 
indication the new genes, 
inserted into defective cells of 
the patients ' bone marrow, 
were producing normal blood 
cells. 

Both patients were 
reported alive and doing well, 
even though the treatment 
apparently had no effect on 
the disease, called beta 
thalassemia major. Affected 
patients are unable to 
produce normal hemoglobin, 
a blood molecule that carries 
the oxygen needed by all 
tissues. 

UCLA's human subjects 
committee onJuly 22 rejected 
Cline's proposal to attempt 
the treatment on campus 
with victims of sickle cell 
anemia, an inherited blood 
disorder that primarily 
affects blacks. 

The rejection "was not 
because of risk," said Albert 
Barber, UCLA vice chancel-
lor for research. "It was 
because the committee felt 
there was a need for doing a 
bit more animal research for 
validation of the scientific 
basis of the experiment." 

Barber and others, though 
concerned that the human 
work may have come a bit too 
soon, still stressed the 
experimental procedure's 
tremendous potential for 

treating currently incurable • 
genetic disea es. 

"I feel that possibilities for 
alleviating human suffering 
by these techniques, when 
they are worked out, is 
enormous," Barber said. 

Cline said he went to 
Hadas ah Hospital in 
Jerusalem and University 
Poly Clinic in Naples not to 
avoid strict' American 
guidelines but to find 
patients with thalassemia. 
Though rare in this country, 
the disease is relatively 
common in the Mediterra-
nean area. 

The procedure was carried 
out before the UCLA 
committee rejected Cline's 
application for on-campus 
work. 

A 21 -year-old woman was 
treated July 10-11 in 
Jerusalem and a 16-year-old 
girl on July 15 in Naples. 

Cline won considerable 
acclaim last spring when he 
and hi UCLA colleagues 
successfully transferred new 
genes into bone marrow cells 
of living mice. He said then, 
"I would say clinical human 
trials could begin in three 
years." 

The two patients were 
treated about three months 
later. The procedure, as 
developed in animal research, 
involves removing a small 
amount of bone marrow from 
the patient. An appropriate 
gene is snipped from cells 
from another source. 

Using a process developed 
by Richard Axel of Columbia 
University, the marrow cells 
and the genes are mixed 
together and some cells are 
supposed to accept the genes 
into their genetic make-up. 

The amended cells are 
theoretically capable of doing 
something they had been 
unable to do before, such as 
make normal hemoglobin. 
The marrow cells are then 
injected back into the patient, 
where they should divide and 
produce more and more 
amended cells. 

Night and morning low clouds and dense fog with 
some clearing in the afternoon are expected: The 
highs will be in the upper 60s and the lows In the 
lower 60s. The water temperature is 62 degrees with 
four to six foot breakers every thirteen seconds.

RODlanticism is 
Reagan's ally 
Appropriate for B-movie actor 

BY M.N. PLANO 
If, as expected, Ronald 

Reagan is swept into office 
this autumn, his greatest ally 
will be romanticism and 
single issue politics. It is 
ironic that this should be so, 
since the man has about as 
much adventure in his heart 
as does an old Kodiak bear. 
But superficially it seems 
appropnate for a "savior" 
who was once a leading man 
in the B·movies. 

For the single issue voters 
of the right, Rea~an's 
romantic appeal is sImple. 
They see him as the 
apotheosis of their collective 
dedication. He will "save the 
unborn," "ban criminals, not 
IUDS" and "unleash the oil 
companies," as each faction 
demands. 

The fact is, Rea~~ 
proa.bJy will do none of t 
things. If his record in 
California means anythi!1J, 
his bark is worse than hiS 
bite. He introduced virtually 
no significant legislation, 
made few attempts to slash 
the liberal programs of his 
predecessors and reigned 
over the b~t tax increase 
in Californaa hist0'1" (A tiny 
portion of this produced his 
vaunted "surplus. to) 

It is form, rather than 
substance, that excites single 
issue voters. This is the 
essence of political romanti· 
cism. (It applies also to the 
romanticism of the left . 
Although john Anderson has 
accomplished virtually 
nothing ever, for anybody -
and up to a few years ago 
resembled Torquemada 
politically - the romantic 
left deems him fit to be 
president on the basis of a 
few cost less windmill tilts at 
a few of their special 
buggaboos.) 

But Reagan counts on two 
more types of romanticism as 
well as special interest 

M.N. Plano is a graduate 
slutknl in astrophysics. 

pandering. One type is called 
Chauvinism. 

Never mind substance. It 
was Nixon and Ford who left 
most of our reserve supplies 
of ammunition and material 
in Vietnam, then sold most of 
the rest, including most of 
our strategic metals reserves. 
Carter has had to find the 
money to buy all of these 
needed items back at 
incredibly inflated prices, yet 
who gets the blame? His 
cancellation of the B·1 is now 
seen as justified. The first 
non· Vietnam, inflation 
adjusted defense increases in 
a decade have come under 
Carter. Still, it is Reagan who 
is believed. Few people study 
or remember, and it is the 
year ci the tallest flagpole. 

None of this bothers me 
much. As I said, Reagan's 
bark has always been worse. 
As governot: he proved 
downright timid. 

We'll pay for 30 years for 
the Supreme Court 1ustices 
he1l appoint. But we II live. 

The thing that scares me 
most, however, is Reagan's 
third romanticism: his view 
toward the non·communist 
world. . 

Anyone will agree that our 
foreign policy has had a 
different stripe of romanti· 
cism under Carter. Yet 
Carter's "human rights" 
campaign remains misun-
derstood. It is contended that 
Reagan will "return us to 
practicality," but nothing is 
farther from the truth . 

For 30 years, under both 
parties, American foreign 
policy has been dominated by 
"knee·jerk" support of 
pathetic, cruel and brittle 
right ·wing regimes that 
merely claimed to be anti· 
communist. I call them 
brittle because most have 
lifespans, and when those 
spans end the regimes are 
often toppled by communist 
(or crypto-religious) insur· 
gencies which don't appear to 
have finite half·lives. 

. , .. 

The Daily Guardian 

Has thi been smart? 
Obvious ly not. Will Reagan ' 
go back to this policy? 
Obvious Iy--yes-Why ? Because 
it is romantic. It has the 
flavor of the Alamo. Romance 
defies logic. 

Carter's credit, he pu hes 
this venerable drive. He's so 
inarticulate, though, that it 
seems the newer Alamo/ 
wounded lion romance of the 
post·war period will easily 
take over again. 

Everyone would rather be 
good, but people think that 
being a wounded lion is more 
practical. It is monetarily 
rewarding in the short term. 
But any other claim to 
success for the new romance 
is horribly false .

The UNAPTP Commission wishes to announce that we 
have peacefully assumed the powers of the Associated 
Student Government as of October 1, 1980. The 
Commission wishes to reaffirm our total commitment to 
the peace, stability, freedom and general well-being of the 
UCSD students. We feel that the UCSD community has a 
right to know the reasons for our noble move. 

After enduring a most repressive and "silly" regime for 
almost two weeks there was student unrest and discontent. 
The stability and legitimacy of our government seemed to 
be questionilble. This was followed by a chain of 
resignations: the SCURI director, the commissioner of 
elections, the commissioner of public relations and the 
commissioner of communications. When he saw his 
government crumbling, President jeremy Charlton 
resigned. Seeing this, we had a few Professors resign; the 
UNAPTP Commission had to take swift action before the 
whole student body resigned . 

This unusual and yet imperative action is in accordance 
with our strong belief in the betterment of mankind, the 
unity of all nations, the cohesion of the universe and the 
survival of the UCSD student.

French president 
reassures Jews 
PARIS - President 

Valery Giscard d 'Estaingand 
his premier took the offensive 

-yesterday to denounce 
attacks against jews and 
proclaim the unity of France 

' in opposing racism and anti-
Semitism. 

Accused by his critics of 
keeping si lent too long, 
Giscard d'Estaing in a five-
minute television address 
reassured France's 650,000 
Jews that the nation will 
stand united to "face the 
threat that is throwing us 
back to the hideous germs of 
intolerance, terrorism and 
racism." 

Premier Raymond Barre 
told a packed National 
Assembly "the entire French 
nation stands beside ... our 
Jewish compatriots in these 
tragic circumstances." 

Barre scathingly denoun· 
ced leftist politicians and 
com mentators who have 
accused the government of 
dr~ing its heels in the fight 
agamst anti·Semitic terror, 
saying "These allegations 
are defamatory and scanda· 
lous ." 

The top-level statements 
came as police announced 
their first lead in the 
investigation of a bomb 
explosion Friday that killed 
four people outside a Paris 
synagogue. 

They said they had 
identified the owner of a , 
motorcycle that was driven 
by a man who witnesses said ' 
placed a package outside the 
synagogue minutes before 
the powerful bomb exploded. 

They did not release his 
name or other details. 

Denouncing the synagogue 
bombing as odious, Giscard d ' 
Estainr declared, " The 
crimina acts bring a painful 
echo to the Jewish commu· 
nity of past events, of 
persecutions, deportations 
and the systematic massacre 
organized by the Hitler ' 
regime. 

"Concerning the French 
jews, who are French among 
other French, my unchan~­
ing position and concern IS 
that they should feel they are 
treated as all others while 
conserving their religion and 
personality as other French 
communities h.flve done."

France in the ouster of the 
vicious Bokassa of the 
"Central African Empire," or 
the genocidal Macias 0' 
Guinea, a Russian puppet? or 
Idi Amin's fall? Both Nigeria 
and Kenya set new mile-
stones in Africa, for pro-
western , democratic transi -
tions of power. We served as 
godfather, if not midwife, in 
each case_ Why haven't we 
been taught to be proud of 
these, and of so many other 
cases there is no room to 
name? 

Our tepid good deeds in 
Nicaragua have changed a 
virtually certain victory for 
Fidel Castro into a case of 
severe aggravation. And in 
the process the Nicaraguans 
are winning a rational 
revolution . •

SKLIF drowns ball handlers 
BY GORDON MAPES 

1M (intramural) waterpolo opened its season last week with 
games on Thursday and Sunday nights. 

On Thursday the AA competition pitted Inflatiables 
against the tough Ream Team, and it was all Ream as they 
blew Inflatiables out of the Nata~ium 34·0. Led by Mimi 
Tucker, who had 13 goals, and John Hyche with four, there 
was never any question of the outcome. 

In single A competition Fallopian Tubes, led by Mark 
Bennett with two goals, defeated Each Hit 7-2. Bottoms Up 
slipped by the Floaties 5-3, and Scream Seaman, led by Lisa 
Polino with four goals, were too much for the Wet Balls in a 
lopsided 21-2 contest. 

Mens waterpolo fares well 
in four weekend matches 

Sunday night the triple A season opened with games 
between the Slippery Bagels and last year's champs 
JWFJLDFJB. In the second game it was SKLIF favored over 
the Ball Handlers. 

In the first game, fought between two of the top four teams, 
the Bagels led the entire game until a last-minute goal by Lori 
Roberson put JWFJ ahead , and the Bagels didn't have time to 
catch up. The final score wa 17-15 in favor of the initials.

In a series of four games in 

days last week the water 
o team came up with three 

against a single loss. 
The Tritons adjusted to 

narrow pool at Gross-

then went on to defeat 
Griffins 15-8.

home opener against Pomona 
College Friday afternoon 16-

The Tritons then lost to 
UC Irvine 15-9 on Saturday. 
Irvine scored a goal in the 
first 10 seconds of play using 
the "submarine play_" This 
tactic is employed by a player

The second game of the evening was not as evenly matched. 
An impress i ve SKLIF tall ied a 20-8 victory overt he st ruggling 
Ball Handlers squad. Led by Claudia O'Brian and Dan Eby, 
each with four goals, SKLIF moved the ball impressively and 
picked off a number of key Handler passes. The Handlers 
made a comeback attempt with six goals in the second half, 
but the win was just out of their reach. Mike Lee was the 
Handlers' lead scorer with six goal . 

Competition continues this weekend .

Reagan's foreign policy 
labeled 'impractical' 
continued from page 4 
squandered our ~ will, 
driven off our friends and 
secretly begun to hate 
ourselves for not being 
ourselves . That is the 
impracticality of the Alamo 
romanticism. 

Tomorrow, if we choose to 
elbow the Russians aside 
with a snort of derision, and 
take over the territory that's 
ours by nature, we'll see this 
whole era end. Carter's made 
a start. But actions count less 

than attitude and under· 
standing in romantic 
matters. 

That's were Carter's failed 
with his inarticulate lack of 
charisma - it's a human 
failing. Too bad. 

But Reagan's failure is a 
failure of mind and heart. 

In hi mind he has failed to 
see the awesome impractical·

In his heart the failure is a 
failure to be American at all.

Snuff and chewing tobacco 
are making a comeback. And 
not solely with the likes of 
Randy Jones and Terry

widespread among many 
health·conscious Americans 
who think they are avoiding 
the dangers of cigarette 
smoking, according to John 
G. Carter, D.D.S., director of 
the Department of Dentistry 
at University Hospital , 
UCSD Medical Center.
