Despite the resignation of its 
former principal and an otherwise 
tumultuous year in the public eye, 
the Preuss School at UCSD remains 
the top high school in California for 
the second year in a row, according 
to a ranking compiled by Newsweek 
magazine.

Housed on the UCSD campus, 
the charter middle and high school 
was named the sixth-best high 
school in the U.S. by the maga-
zine, climbing three spots from its 
ninth-place position in last year’s 
survey. Rankings were deter-
mined by totaling the number of 
Advanced Placement, International 
Baccalaureate and Cambridge tests 
taken in 2007 and dividing them by 
the number of graduating seniors.

While Newsweek editor Jay 
Mathews said that some educa-
tors disputed the ranking system 

as overly simplistic, he argued that 
the list is valuable for the purposes 
of encouraging schools to provide a 
challenging, rigorous curriculum for 
their students.

The fact that all Preuss School 
students take multiple AP courses 
and their corresponding exams con-
tributed to the school’s strong per-
formance within the ranking system, 
Principal Scott Barton said.

Co-chartered by UCSD and the 
San Diego Unified School District, 
the Preuss School’s enrollment is 
primarily made up of low-income 
and minority students. Potential stu-
dents must submit a comprehensive 
application to attend the school and 
are selected by lottery.

Although a 2004 study by UCSD’s 
Center for Research on Educational 
Equity, Assessment and Teaching 
Excellence found that Preuss School 
students did not perform statisti-
cally better on standardized tests 
than applicants rejected from the 
school, data released in February by 
the same office demonstrated that 
the charter’s students have a higher 
AP-exam passing rate than other 
high schools in San Diego.

WHAT’S IN A NAME?

Over the course of the past year, 
UCSD has begun to disappear from 
the national radar. 

From hats and T-shirts in the 
Price Center Bookstore to the cam-
pus’ newly renovated Web site, “UC 
San Diego” is slowly replacing the 
four-letter moniker on more than 
just merchandise. The subtle yet 

pointed rebranding is not coinciden-
tal. This deliberate push by campus 
leaders to market the university is 
one of many careful decisions dele-
gated to the office of university com-
munications and public affairs, the 
men and women working behind 
the curtain to shape the campus’ 
image in the public eye. 

“There have been discussions for 
many years regarding what UCSD 
should call itself,” said lead univer-

sity spokeswoman Stacie A. Spector, 
head of the communications office 
and UCSD’s official mouthpiece 
for most of its important issues. 
“What we found over time is that 
the acronym UCSD does not reso-
nate much beyond San Diego, and 
locally is confused with a couple of 
other prestigious institutions in the 
region, thereby losing opportunities

With the cost of attending college 
climbing across the nation, lawmakers 
on Capitol Hill are working rapidly to 
renew the Higher Education Act with 
the hope of promising students afford-
able loans and trustworthy informa-
tion about the cost of attending col-
lege.

Originally created in 1965, the 
HEA secured federal money for insti-
tutions of higher education, created 
low-interest student loan programs 
and funded scholarships. 

Though the HEA has yet to be 
updated, Congress has collectively 
agreed that the act’s next renewal 
should be aggressive toward monitor-

One of the major attempts that the

known as the College Opportunity

Drug Could Benefit Organ 
Transplant Patients 

A recent study at the UCSD 
department of medicine’s division of 
nephrology suggests that the drug 
sirolimus may help prolong the bene-
fits of transplanted kidneys and delay 
rejection, especially for “noncompli-
ant” patients who do not regularly 
take their prescribed medications.

Cheri Ye, M.D., presented the find-
ings at the 2008 American Transplant 
Congress in Toronto on May 31.

Ye’s mentor, professor of medicine 
and director of transplant nephrol-
ogy Robert Steiner, said the drug 
— whose brand name is Rapamune 
— may be the answer to undetect-
able complications associated with 
kidney transplants.

“No one is perfect at taking medi-
cations,” he said. “But missing doses 
of immunosuppression, or not taking 
full doses each day, will bring about 
gradual rejection of kidney trans-
plants that is almost impossible to 
detect in its early stages. Long-acting 
drugs like sirolimus may help with this 
problem.”

A team of five UCSD investiga-
tors assessed immune function at 
“trough” levels (lowest daily intake) of 
the three most commonly prescribed 
immunosuppressive drugs, measur-
ing “mitogenic response” and the 
level of protection from rejection in 
160 kidney-transplant patients.

At these trough levels, sirolimus 
caused a significantly lower level of 
mitogenic response — representing 
greater protection — and results were 
stable in patients over time.

“At least half of transplanted kid-
neys are lost through chronic graft 
rejection, usually within 10 years,” 

said David Perkins, professor of 
medicine and surgery and director of 
research for transplantation. “When 
patients do not have those rejection 
problems, they can go for 20 to 30 
years before kidney rejection or other 
serious problems. This is an espe-
cially important issue now because 
of our nationwide donor-organ short-
age.”

Jacobs School Opens New 
Control Systems Center
UCSD’s Jacobs School of 

Engineering announced last week that 
Cymer Inc. has provided major fund-
ing for an educational and research 
program designed to train engineers 
to improve a wide variety of industrial 
products and processes.

The new Cymer Center for 
Control Systems and Dynamics, 
which opened May 30, is designed 
to enhance the Jacobs School’s 
chances of gaining numerous high-
tech industry partnerships. CCSD will 
offer a wide range of control class-
es and seminars whose breadth is 
unmatched by other U.S. universities. 
Topics include communication sys-
tems and networks, seismic protec-
tion, aerospace and marine systems 
and sensor networks,

“The field of controls has matured 
to the point where we can now apply 
what we are learning from fusion reac-
tors and magnetic levitation trains to 
numerous other areas of application,” 
said Miroslav Krstic, founding director 
of CCSD and a professor of mechani-
cal and aerospace engineering at the 
Jacobs School. “The new center will 
broaden the faculty’s exposure to 
practical problems to a growing list of 
important industrial applications.”

be terminated. 
Two-hundred fifteen employees 

selected a voluntary buyout option 
offered by the lab that included 
severance packages. Last week, an 
additional 440 employees were let go 
involuntarily, and layoffs are expected 
to continue throughout the year. 

“One hundred flexible term and 
temporary employees will be let go,” 
Seaver said. “That will take place on 
June 26 and that will be the end of 

our workforce reduction.”
The policy for determining which 

employees will be fired differs for 
scientists and nonresearch employ-
ees. The policy for nonscientists is 
based on seniority, so those hired 
most recently would be the first to 
be dismissed in a forced reduction. 
Termination of scientists is based on 
knowledge and abilities. 

“We base [the layoffs] on what they 
have and what we need to meet our 

October when the laboratory, which 
had previously been run exclusively by 
the University of California, switched 
management to Lawrence Livermore 
National Security Group, a limited 
liability company comprised of several 
corporations and the university.

LLNL’s defining goal is national 
and homeland security, achieved 
through the design and development 
of nuclear weapons, research into sus-
tainable energy, developing biodefense 
capabilities, improving disease pre-
vention and preventing the spread and 
use of weapons of mass destruction. 

Since the switch in management, 
the workforce has been reduced by 
2,000, from approximately 8,800 to 
6,800 employees. According to LLNL 
spokeswoman Lynda Seaver, the lab 
faces a budget shortfall of $280 mil-
lion this year. 

The funding deficit was caused by 
several factors, including the federal 
budget, a new contract with LLNSG 
and the rising cost of employee ben-
efits.  

“The federal budget approved by 
Congress was $100 million less than 
last year,” Seaver said. “The contract 
we have now is much more expensive 
to operate. There are also medical 
costs, retirement packages and infla-
tion. All of these factors created a 
budget shortfall of $280 million.”

The reduction phase began in 
January when the lab laid off 550 
employees, and then announced in 
March that 750 more staffers would

missions and milestones assigned to us 
by the administration,” Seaver said. “So 
those with 10 or 15 years of experience 
can be laid off, which was unfortu-
nately what happened last week.”

Changes in administration and 
operation are expected in the lab due 
to the layoffs.

“Cost and efficiencies will tight-
en up and we’ll make things run 
more smoothly and more efficiently,” 
Seaver said. “Facilities management, 
computer support and procurement 
will be going through changes as a 
means to save money.”

The primary goal of the lab 
— national and homeland security 
— however, will remain the same 
despite the layoffs, since the cuts were 
made primarily to administration and 
operations rather than scientists. 

“When we cut scientists we made 
it with an eye toward making sure we 
had the necessary skills and could 
still fulfill our mission,” Seaver said.

To help employees cope with 
being let go, the laboratory opened a 
resource center on May 29 available 
to all dismissed employees. 

The center, which will stay open 
until September, provides resources 
to assist with resume writing, job 
interviewing, networking and pro-
vides lists of job fairs and job open-
ings in the California. 

“The full function is to try and 
find people a job,” Seaver said.

Congress were working to finalize 
a compromise renewal of the HEA 
before Memorial Day. However, due 
to Kennedy’s recent medical problems, 
the race to finish the compromise has 
been put on hold.

Rep. Susan Davis (D-Calif.), who 
serves most of the city of San Diego and 
sits on the House Education and Labor 
Committee, expressed issues related to 
her constituents during the bill-draft-
ing process. 

According to Davis’ press secretary, 
Aaron Hunter, one of her main con-
cerns is providing students with fed-
eral-aid benefits during natural disas-
ter situations, such as the Southern 
California wildfires that occurred late 
last year. 

“Susan wants to ensure that stu-
dents receive work study at times when 
it is needed and they cannot work,” 
Hunter said.  “She also wants to cease 
interest collection on military students 
on active duty.”

One of the provisions of the House 
bill proposes rigorous financial moni-
toring of institutions of higher educa-
tion that have raised their tuition costs, 
something that has been seen in the 

by UCSD professors Julian Betts 
and Hugh “Bud” Mehan, Preuss 
School seniors passed an average 
of two more AP exams than their 
peers in the 2005-06 school year.

Betts and Mehan, who serve 
on the Preuss School Board of 
Directors, said the facts validate 
the school’s strategy of prioritizing 
AP exams.

“By giving the students ample 
access to college-level coursework, 
and, crucially, having them take 
an externally administered exam 
approved by the College Board, the 
school gives its students an invalu-
able foretaste of the level of rigor 
that universities will expect,” the 
study said.

Of the school’s 97 graduating 
seniors, 96 percent were admitted 
to a four-year college or university 
and 89 percent accepted the offer 
of admission, Barton said. About 
25 percent of these students will be 
attending a University of California 
campus, with 8 percent electing to 
attend UCSD.

Major administrative changes 

Preuss Admin. Credits AP Focus for Success
▶ PREUSS, from page 1 at the school have been ongoing 

since December, after UCSD’s Audit 
and Management Advisory Services 
released a report criticizing the 
school’s leaders for lax procedural 
oversight. Auditors found inaccu-

rately recorded grades in 144 of 
the 190 transcripts they reviewed, 
72 percent of which improved the 
affected students’ overall grade 
point average.

Ex-Principal Doris Alvarez 
denied any knowledge of the grade 
changes, but resigned her position 

shortly after the audit’s release. 
Barton has been serving as acting 
principal since December, and was 
appointed permanently on May 30 
after a five-month search.

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox said 
Barton’s 27 years of teaching and 
administrative experience qualified 
him to lead the school in the post-
audit transition period.

“We are entering a new era in the 
school’s history, and Scott will provide 
exceptional leadership as we further 
strengthen management processes 
and communication with key stake-
holders,” Fox said in a statement.

Barton said that while the year 
has been challenging, he always had 
faith that the student body would 
pull through academically.

“I was not worried that our 
student performance would suffer 
because our students have taken 
rigorous college-prep courses that 
have prepared them for college,” he 
said. “They have earned their way 
to college.”

Bill Would Increase Tuition Transparency 
▶ EDUCATION, from page 1 University of California throughout the 

past decade. 
Under the COAA, 5 percent of 

institutions in each category (private, 
public, two-year, four-year, etc.) that 
raise their costs by the highest percent-
age in three years would be required to 
create “quality efficiency task forces” to 

investigate the fee hikes.
Carolyn Henrich, legislative direc-

tor to the University of California’s 
branch in the District of Columbia, 
said she feels that the COAA’s watchdog 
components — called “accountability 
provisions” — are only going to con-

fuse families and students further.
“Though Congress’ intentions are 

good, I think they are to going to pro-
vide too much information to families 
who want a simpler way to get accurate 
data about the colleges their children 
are applying to,” Henrich said. 

Tristie A. Ross, a UCSD graduate 
student, said she believes that universi-
ties are making matters more compli-
cated by raising costs without student 
consent.

“When students choose to come 
to a college, it should be like signing a 
contract —whatever price or education 
that was agreed upon should be set in 
stone,” Ross said. “Inflating tuition costs 
is not going to make it any better for the 
universities or the students when the 
students can no longer attend.”

Pending legislation in the House 
would require colleges to give accu-
rate estimates of their costs over the 
academic year. Textbook companies 
would have to provide their ISBN num-
bers and price listings to students, and 
would be discouraged from bundling 
CDs and DVDs along with them.

OPINION

Guardian Editorial Board: How has the 
transition for you been?
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny 
Rue: It’s really been exciting. It’s really a 
challenge.  The best thing that I can liken it 
to, that college students can relate to, is the 
transition when you first come to college. 
When, all of a sudden, everything in your 
life is new: new phone numbers, new streets 
to learn, whole new sets of friends. You lose 
all of your grounding but on the other hand, 
it’s more exciting — the promise, the pos-
sibilities and all of that. 

So it’s been very exciting for me. There 
are obviously plenty of challenges as you 
would expect from a job of this magnitude. 
But I have made my priority be getting 
to know people and creating relationships 
because that’s what student affairs is, that’s 
what leadership is.  I really felt like I needed 
to get myself out there.  That goes for stu-
dents, staff, faculty, alumni.  I think it’s very 
common in higher education that you turn 
upper administrators into objects because 
they seem remote. That creates distance 
when what you really need to do is have trust 
and respect to get the work done.  

What I’ve tried to do is be as approach-
able and accessible as possible, because all of 
the work in student affairs is done through 
consensus, people coming together. There 
might be a rare occasion where I have to 
make a decision and impose it on others. 
I have really enjoyed San Diego.  Coming 
from the East Coast, East coasters tend to 
think of California as Los Angeles, they 
think of it as very fashion conscious, very 
concerned with status and image and all of 
that. But San Diego is very different from 
that. I’ve appreciated the genuineness, the 
friendliness, the openness — and of course 
the climate.

Guardian: What were some of the biggest 
challenges for you?
Rue: One of the most interesting challenges 
for me was the fact that I have never super-
vised admissions before, and that’s probably 
the most mission critical aspect of student 
affairs. If we don’t admit a great class, we 
don’t have a university.  

Guardian: And this year’s statistics, which 
saw a drop in black admissions but rise in 
Latino admissions?
Rue: The numbers are so small that it’s hard 
to call it a trend. We’re pleased with the 
upper trend in Latinos. We’ve already pored 
over the numbers and realized there were a 
couple of important aspects. One of the big-
gest challenges is the issue of scholarships. 

UCLA and Berkeley are able to give a lot 
more financial aid. They have $100 million 
and $375 million, respectively, in financial 
aid endowments. 

Of course, we’re younger, we’re smaller, 
so that’s a growing issue. UCLA has particu-
larly done some things in that areas that we’ll 
try to learn from, and UC Santa Barbara has 
done some interesting things that are com-
munity-based.

Guardian: Does the problem lie in fund-
raising?
Rue: It’s partly fundraising for scholarships. 
Also, the African-American students that 
don’t come here, the top five schools they 
do go to are Berkeley, UCLA, USC, Stanford 
and Harvard. They’re fabulous schools, but 
I’m sure scholarships have a lot to do with it, 
especially for private schools. 

But we know we need to do more; one 
of the data points tells us that if pro-
spective students can visit the campus, it 
increases their chances of accepting admis-
sions. The campus has an image of being 
remote, because it’s not embedded in the 
city. But once students come here they real-
ize it’s friendly. But it will continue to be 
a challenge. We’re exciting with the work 
being done by students with student-initi-
ated outreach. We’ll also be working with 
the faculty’s Committee on Admissions to 
look at what needs to be tweaked. We’ve had 
successes and setbacks in that area.

Guardian: One of your foremost focuses 
this year was on-campus mental health. 
What has the progress of that issue been?
Rue: We have a really excellent program 
in Thurgood Marshall College with the 
Wellness Center pilot program. We saw 
good results and reductions in student stress 
from that project. We also were a part of 
the Administration of American College 

Health Association’s National College Health 
Assessment, so we have really good data now 
about prevalence of mental-health issues 
and concerns. It helps us make a case for 
resources and planning. 

We have some interesting conversations 
going with the UCSD Medical Center. Their 
primary-care family medicine physicians are 
interested in what they call integrative medi-
cine, which is more preventive in nature. 
We’re involved in conversations with them. 

In the long run, we’re looking to build a 
Wellness Center that will pull together rec-
reation leaders, mental-health folks, health 
advocates and stress managers to destigma-
tize health-seeking behavior and create a 
culture of wellness. 

This also comes back to fundraising 
issues, but we are expecting an increase in 
mental-health funding from the UC Office 
of the President. When we look at mental 
health, we look at three tiers: the first is 
direct treatment and service for individuals 
that identify themselves as needing help; the 
second tier is targeted outreach and preven-
tion activities for people that are more prone 
to stress; the third tier contains things that 
develop a sense of community so that people 
feel connected and don’t get to the end of 
their rope. We’re hoping to work on all three 
of those dimensions.

Guardian: In talking with students, what 
have you heard students say about their 
relationship to the campus?
Rue: I’ve found that most students want to 
create or experience enduring campus tradi-
tions. They want to feel like they’re a long-
term part of the UCSD community.

Guardian: What role do you see construc-
tion projects like Price Center East playing 
in building campus community?
Rue: I think it’s fascinating what architec-

ture can do to create synergies. If you think 
about the people that you made friends with 
in your freshman year, it was probably the 
people who lived closest to you. It works 
that way in offices too, where you create 
relationships with the people you walk past 
everyday. 

So I think having the alumni affairs office 
right next to the student organization lead-
ers is just brilliant. It will create intergen-
erational collaboration. It will really help us 
in the long run. I love the openness of it; it 
sends a hugely powerful message to some-
body that’s new to campus that’s wondering, 
“Do I belong here. Is this for me?” 

It’s all so inviting, it draws people in. 
Architectures can be very powerful for send-
ing the kind of messages we want to about 
membership and belonging. The Cross-
Cultural Center’s position looking right over 
the open area also says so much about 
messages of inclusion — who belongs and 
how they belong. I think it was a visionary 
architecture. 

Guardian: What have you heard students 
say about their relationship with San 
Diego?
Rue: I find that students really do appreciate 
the small community that the college envi-
ronment offers, particularly while they’re 
residents. Obviously, after they move off 
campus, that bond is destroyed. So I think 
there’s a real opportunity there to try to 
rethink that transition of what it means 
when you become a commuter student. 

Hopefully, I think it’s true for most stu-
dents, they’ve established a set of engage-
ments and relationships that gets them on 
campus. Once you get home, what draws 
you back to campus? It’ll be interesting to 
see if the Loft, for example, is going to draw 
students back. Still, San Diego is so amaz-
ing that I think we undersell it a little bit in 

Old People, Super Glue and Unleashed Dogs? Quick, Call the Cops
Tenth week of Spring Quarter marks the approach of the good (summer break!), the 
bad (finals week) and the trag-
ic (this year’s final installment of 
“Stealing the Shoes”). But to ease 
the pain of a summer without 
snarky UCSD commentary cour-
tesy of yours truly, I bring you 
the now-annual Best of “Lights and 
Sirens.” If you’re like me and make 
a habit of checking out page three 
on Mondays, you know what I’m 
talking about. But if you’re unfor-
tunately unfamiliar with UCSD’s 
weekly police-report wrap-up, have 
no fear: I have distilled all the 2007-
08 bests and present them to you in 
these next awards.

First, let’s start with an oldie 
but goody, this year’s Outstanding 
Senior Award goes to the 50-year-
old white male spotted on May 2 
wearing a pink tie and blue hat, 
“possibly under the influence of 
drugs or alcohol,” walking down 

Library Walk. That’s the youthful 
spirit UCSD needs more of! (The 
elderly Mardi-Gras-bead sporting 
woman at Round Table Pizza on 
February 7, the 50-year-old man 
suspected of lewd conduct at Porter’s 
Pub on February 11 and the drunk 
55-year-old man hanging out in 
front of Thornton Hospital dressed 
only in a bathing suit and hospi-
tal blanket on January 1 definitely 
deserve honorable mentions.)

Next, allow me to give props to 
all our furry friends on campus. 
While there were quite a few animal 
calls this year — mostly unleashed 
dogs and bees, with one rattlesnake 
report that police promptly forward-
ed to animal control (who reported-
ly would not respond unless some-
one stood by with the snake) — one 
little dog named Gomie wins Most 
Outrageous Animal Emergency 
for the call that Gomie’s concerned 
owner made on February 5. The 
police log: “A shaved golden-haired 

Pomeranian named Gomie, last 
seen wearing a blue-and-yellow 
sweatshirt, was reported as missing 
at Geisel Library.” (Hope you found 
your way home, you flashy, spirited 
Triton pup, you.)

And as I was perusing the year’s 
“emergencies,” I noticed a remark-
able number of reports from the 
Rebecca and John Moores Cancer 
Center, which is why it earned the 
These Secretaries Have Too Much 
Free Time Award. Over the course 
of the year, people at the center 
reported a ton of useless crimes — 
everything from missing magazines 
and bumped heads to food being 
stolen from the staff refrigerator. 
Though none of these crimes really 
warranted police attention.

But the police reports weren’t 
all laughs, the legitimate calls, like 
domestic violence and serious injury 
reports, were sad to see. So what was 
the worst thing I found in the year’s 
“Light and Sirens” collection? A May 

7 report that is best summarized as 
the Most Appalling Violation of 
Freedom. Congrats to the Lesbian 
Gay Bisexual Transgender Resource 
Center director who called police 
to report a preacher exercising his 
freedom of speech on Library Walk. 
So much for tolerance.

Not all the San Diego drug busts 
were as big as San Diego State’s frat 
arrests and another downer was 
the volume of people caught in 
alcohol or marijuana-possession 
reports. But two groups deserve a 
Campus High Life Award for their 
smooth handling of confrontation 
from authorities. First is the girl 
who, when caught with marijuana 
by an administrator on February 
28, claimed “she did not know that 
was not the protocol.” Next is the 
November 14 group who, when 
caught playing beer pong, claimed 
it was ginger ale. While these excus-
es proved futile, I respect the bold 
creativity that these individuals dis-

played under pressure.
This leads me to the Get It Girl 

Award, which goes to the bold 
couple found sleeping in Pepper 
Canyon Hall after “having rela-
tions,” at 6:22 a.m. on November 
26. (Runners-up are the two men 
found “performing oral copulation” 
in Mayer Hall earlier that month.)

Next we have a returning honor, 
the Uh, You’re Dumb Award. 
Congrats to the man who called 
police after realizing he could not 
remove the handcuffs given to him 
at a Halloween party. An honorable 
mention for this one goes to all the

how accessible it is. I think La Jolla 
is not a college town, but there are 
plenty of places nearby that are. 

Guardian: Does that mean creat-
ing more local partnerships? How 
would you want to connect to the 
local community?
Rue: It will be interesting to see 
what Senior Week tells us, how 
popular and successful it is.  With 
that, we built partnerships with 
Sea World and partnerships with  
the Padres.

Guardian: The state as a whole

campus. It’s definitely not possible 
that they’re students or even UCSD

unfortunate, oppressive atmosphere

Rue: Tight State Budget Cramps 
Fiscal Flexibility of  Department

▶ RUE, from page 4 thing that the governor did was put 
the 10-percent cuts on the table, 
then pulled the cuts back from 
the education sector. We still don’t 
have a concrete budget yet and 
we’ll probably enter the school year 
without a budget, which is kind of 
scary. But one of the things we do 
is review every vacancy to make 
sure it’s necessary; you don’t want 
to bring new staff on and have to 
let them go. So we want to justify 
every position and hire right now.

Guardian: Does it put any pressure 
on your department’s advance 
planning?
Rue: Absolutely, of course it does. 
It’s interesting how fast things 
change. When I first came into this 
job, this economic forecast wasn’t 
in the cards. The university was in 
a growth mode with new resources, 
so it wasn’t my initial goal to come 
to a place and have to work with 
fiscal constraints — but that’s the 
current reality.

Guardian: What were your impres-
sions of the new format of the Sun 
God Festival? As this is your first 
festival, how do you plan on deal-
ing with complaints and protests 
that have mainly been over the 
new festival’s relation to previous 
festivals?
Rue: Of course, I don’t have any 
basis of comparison; I don’t know 
the old Sun God. I’ve heard people 
talking about. It’s one of those 
things you tend to look at with 
rose-colored glasses. It’s really not 
my role and responsibility to lay 
judgment on the event. 

What I need to do is make sure 
that the students that are the plan-
ners of it have the support they

need from the college. I thought it 
was a very well-run event this year. 
When you see that many people in 
one place having a good time, it’s 
pretty inspiring. 

That venue did not work as 
well for the daytime activities. In 
that sense, it was too big; you had 
1,000 people there, but the field 
holds 20,000 so it looks like no 
one is there. I got there at around 
4:30 p.m. to [the Midway] where 
they had student performances. 
And I saw that people loved those 
because they were exciting, but it 
was a relatively small reach. Those 
are some things I think should 
be worked on, but they are very 

Rue Wants Backseat Role in Sun God Festival Planning
▶ CHANCELLOR, from page 5 doable.

Guardian: Do you see this year’s 
form of Sun God as one of those 
“enduring traditions” you men-
tioned?
Rue: If that’s what the students 
want, I’m in favor of that. I don’t 
plan student programs for a rea-
son; I didn’t know any of those 
bands or any of the music. I don’t 
like that music. But none of it is 
really up to me. I don’t like music 
that loud. [laughs]

Guardian: What kind of support did 
you offer programmers this year?
Rue: What I was most involved in 
was the creation of our own detox 

center in the Rec Gym. Usually, stu-
dents that are not hospital-worthy or 
jail-worthy go to detox downtown. 

What students tell us is that it’s 
a sketchy area. They’d get down 
there, sleep it off with no cell 
phone or purse. The police would 
tell us the time to take students 
down there and come back was 
time away from their ability to 
help on campus. We wondered if 
we could create a partnership there 
that would enable us to make sure 
students were safer and cared for 
on a campus-based environment 
that would support our police, who 
had a very difficult job to do that 
day. It proved to be very success-
ful.

“When you see that many people in one place having a good 
time, it’s pretty 
inspiring.” 

and to make sure that she was willing 
to make the commitment to the track 
team. To Ahner’s relief, Johnson found 
a track-less life boring and decided to 
come back to the sport.

Last weekend, Johnson won 
the national championship in the 
triple jump at the NCAA Division-
II Championships in Walnut, Calif. 
Before the meet, Johnson had already 
been named a two-time All-American 
and was the record holder for UCSD 
in both the long and triple jumps, but 
it took her third trip to nationals to 
finally come away with a gold medal. 

“I definitely couldn’t have imagined 
a better way to end my track career,” 
Johnson said. “Those types of achieve-
ments are something that you can only 
dream about but when you actually get 
it, it’s kind of surreal.”

Johnson’s triumph was the culmi-
nation of the success of the women’s 
team as a whole, as the Tritons took 
fourth place at nationals, their best fin-
ish since moving up to the D-II level. 
Johnson, who was part of the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association title 
team her freshman year that set the 
precedent for the team’s current suc-
cessful run, sees this year as a logical 
next step in the ongoing improvement 
of UCSD track.

“This year was a culmination of 
what prior athletes had started,” she 
said. “We had the mindset all along 
and we had the talent all along, it’s just 
being able to put it all together in the 
right place at the right time. The other 
schools are starting to see us as more 
of a threat and are starting to pay a lot 
more attention to what we’re doing. It’s 
kind of cool to be one of the ones that 
got the ball rolling on that from fresh-
man year on when we first won the 
conference title.”

After a sophomore slump where 
she missed nationals for the first time, 
Johnson came back her junior year 
more determined than ever. She was 
the second-ranked jumper going into 
nationals but ended up finishing a dis-
appointing fourth, even though she did 
earn her first All-American award.

Her senior season was filled with 
memorable accomplishments. Along 
with extending her own all-time UCSD 
record in the triple jump, Johnson 
became the school’s record holder in 
the long jump en route to being named 
CCAA Athlete of the Year and NCAA 
D-II Field Athlete of the Year. For an 
athlete that had always flown under the 
radar, this newfound attention was a 
little off-putting.

“It was kind of not fair [being named 
National Field Athlete of the Year] right 
before nationals,” Johnson said. “I like 
being the underdog, I don’t like people 
watching me or talking about me, I like 
surprising you and kind of just pulling 
one out from under you. It put a lot of 
extra stress on me; I didn’t really want 
to be a target.” 

Being a target or not, Johnson per-
severed through thunder storms and 
delayed start times to take the gold 
medal in the women’s triple jump and 
cap off an outstanding career in the 
most fitting way possible.  

Johnson’s current relationship with 
her coach is odd, given their first inter-
actions, as for the entire summer before 
starting college Johnson avoided talk-
ing to the person who would end up 
having the biggest impact on her col-
legiate life.

“The biggest factor for me at UCSD 
is Darcy; she is the only factor,” Johnson 
said. “She is the reason that I am the 
jumper that I am today.”

Aside from her countless awards 
on the track, Johnson is most proud of 
the legacy that she, and her teammates 
from the past four years, will leave to 
the school and is excited for the future 
of the program that she helped define.

“We have started a dynasty and 
I think everybody should jump on 
board, because you don’t want to miss 
what’s coming next.”

sons.” Like the person who reported 
a Halloween trick-or-treater: The 
student had “black and white paint 
on his face and a black shirt was … 
asking passing students for candy.” 
Or the person who reported “two 
20-year-old Latino males … wear-
ing gloves and carrying tools by 
the construction site at Lot 703.” 
(Checks OK.) Gee, they couldn’t be, 
I don’t know, construction workers?!

Alternatively, I bring you the 
two Bizarre Crime I’m Sorry I 
Missed Award winners. Congrats 
to the trespassing man who jumped 
“into a kelp tank containing sen-
sitive animals at Birch Aquarium 
Admissions in spite of surrounding

And the group of students arguing 
over “times for using the kilns” 
(Bonus points to guy who, when 
questioned by police at the scene, 

responded: “Shove it up your ass.”) 
Oh, and the guy who stole $50 
worth of coffee-cart pastries gets an 
honorable mention.

And finally, this year’s Shining 
Light in “Lights and Sirens” 
Award goes to three individuals 
who decided to shake things up, 
and finally bring some fun to cam-
pus: the host of the “out of con-
trol” party on October 28, the juve-
nile reported on September 30 as 

“drunk and walking down La Jolla 
Village Drive carrying 40 oz. of 
Miller Genuine Draft” and the guy 
caught making beer at Oceania Hall 
on May 22. Thanks for giving it the 
old college try.

Alright guys, that brings us to 
the end of our awards ceremony. 
Congrats again to all this year’s 
winners, and to the audience: Have 
a great summer, thanks for another 
good year.

for UC San Diego to 
strengthen its reputation.”

Although the 48-year-old 
university has piled up acco-
lades for its research and aca-

demic rigor, Spector said gradu-
ates seeking to capitalize on their 
name-brand degrees are more 
likely to benefit from a school rec-
ognized throughout the nation — a 
change she hopes will accompany 
the switch.

“We want to elevate the rec-
ognition of UC San Diego and its 
reputation and work to create strong 
emotional connections to the univer-
sity,” she said. “We want our students, 
staff, faculty, alumni, parents, donors, 
friends, supporters, neighbors and 
vendors to have that emotional 
response when they see someone 
wearing a UC San Diego sweatshirt.”

The rebranding effort was under-
taken by the UC San Diego Marketing 
Council, an unofficial group of vol-
unteers comprised of administra-
tors, staff members and students. 
Representatives from arenas like the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 

UCSD Transportation 
and Parking Services, the 
bookstore and the Chancellor’s 
Organization of Allied Students par-
ticipate in brainstorming meetings 
where they provide input on what 
promotional strategies have been or 
could be effective. The group also 
contributes to campuswide initiatives 
designed to cultivate a sense of pride 
and community, such as the UCSD 
Rocks Open House and the closing 
celebration for “The Campaign for 
UCSD: Imagine What’s Next,” the 
seven-year fundraising effort that 
made UCSD $1 billion richer.

“The rebranding from UCSD to 
UC San Diego has really given a 
stronger, more distinct identity to our 
university,” said Earl Warren College 
alumna Lauren White, who served 
on the council during the 2006-07 
school year and now works for the 
UCSD Alumni Association. “I’ve 

heard UCSD mistaken for 
USC, SDSU, 

U C S B , 
UCSC and 
USD. Now that we are 
known as UC San Diego, we 
will stand out in a sea of other uni-
versity names.”

White said the rebranding was part 
of a larger effort designed to generate a 
sense of campus community, which 
is best summarized by the “Eat, Shop, 
Play, Relax, Meet, Belong” motto of 
the Price Center East addition.

“All the things that bring a com-
munity together are written into the 
branding of PC East; it’s impossible for 
students to not feel a different, more 
welcoming vibe,” she said.

While the communication office’s 
marketing tactics may escape atten-
tion, its price tag is certainly more 
conspicuous: Almost $2.8 million 

is allocated yearly to Spector’s 
office, which oversees 

press rela-

t i o n s , 
m a r k e t i n g , 
strategic and electronic 
communications, tours and special 
events and protocol. Approximately 
$2.3 million of the budget is allo-
cated annually to employee salaries, 
$237,000 to benefits and $264,000 to 
general operating expenses.

These monies fund a number of 
public-relations initiatives, includ-
ing what Spector calls “new media,” 
which incorporates the use of video, 
podcasting and social networking 
Web sites such as Facebook to sustain 
and promote UCSD’s rapidly growing 
reputation. Her office is also targeting 
ethnic media outlets like Spanish-lan-
guage television station Univision and 
Voice and Viewpoint, a local newspa-

per geared toward black readers. 
The combination of these 

two efforts serves 
to increase 

t h e 

“overall diversity” of the campus, she 
said.

“Our faculty experts have become 
so diverse that our international and 
national outreach and media place-
ment has increased dramatically in the 
last four years,” Spector said, citing a 
recent research breakthrough on quit-
ting smoking that was covered by more 
than 708 worldwide media outlets.

Much of the targeted public-
ity focuses on UCSD’s strong back-
ground in the sciences, though 
Spector said press coverage of the 
campus’ arts and humanities, social 
sciences and graduate programs has 
been steadily increasing over the last 
four years.

However, amplified media 
attention to such a large university 
inevitably unearths a fair number of 
skeletons in administrators’ closets. 
UCSD has seen its share of these bad-

press situations in the past year,

parking lot, Kobey’s Swap Meet 
is a deal-finder’s destination for 
kitschy collectables and amusing 
junk. As a 32-year-old tradition, 
the weekly event is the third larg-
est outdoor market on the West 
Coast, bringing about 30,000 
shoppers and 1,000 vendors. 

Filled with a range of vendors 
— from modest garage sale lots 
to handcrafted accessory stations 
— the market features a homey 
ambiance conducive to hours of 
roaming. For students hoping to 
furnish their apartments, vintage 
dining sets and bizarre artwork 
run below $10. If you’re look-
ing to economize, $1 lots offer 
cheasp household items. While 

c o m m e r c i a l 
vendors sell Forever 
21-ish accessories (read: 
unconvincing designer knock-
offs), unexpected trinkets scat-
tered throughout the lot provide 
surprising deals on classic jewelry 
and purses. For those hoping to 
relive their childhood (or imagine 
the pathetic lack of technology 
during their parents’ childhoods), 
archaic cameras, dated telephones 
and eerie troll dolls are peppered 
throughout sellers’ selections. 

While it’s easy to get lost 
among aisles of junk, smart shop-
pers should come with a game 
plan. Since the meet is outside, 
dress for the weather accordingly. 
Although the entry charge is just 

$1, bring 
plenty of cash to 
avoid the market’s pric-
ey ATM surcharge. If you’re 
planning on purchasing heavy 
furniture, rent a $7 cart. While 
there are cheap lunch options 
(like $3 corndogs) bring your 
appetite to better restaurants off of 
Rosencrans. As for parking, avoid 
the Sports Arena and drop off 
your car on a nearby side street.

Whether you’re treasure 
searching or just looking to 
laugh at some weird stuff, 
Kobey’s is a thrifty way to 

s p e n d 
a weekend 
morning.

MONDAY, JUNE 2, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCUS  9

Standing in the spotless entryway of my friend’s apartment, I stared down at the crisp lights reflecting 
off the gleaming white tiles. My feet were 
covered in black grime. I had removed 
my shoes but was terrified about leaving 
tracks. I was itching furiously because 
of the wicked sunburn across my neck 
and forearms; countless mosquito bites 
and the strange 
rash on my upper 
arm added to my 
discomfort. I could 
smell, ever so faint-
ly, the soft odor of 
pine-scented clean-
ing solution over 
the pungent funk 
I had accumulated 
over the last three days. The thought 
crossed my mind, if only for a second, 
that my latest Egyptian adventure had 
not been worth quite so much trouble.

It had begun as most of our trips 
do. I was headed out the door, and my 
roommate Wesley Horne shouted out 
something like, “What about middle 
Egypt, maybe Minya?”

“Yeah,” I shouted back. “That’s where 
all the terrorists grew up.”

Minya, as I had learned over the year, 
was once a thriving tourist stop between 
upper and lower Egypt. Those taking 
the longer, overland route to Luxor and 
Aswan in the south would often stop 
in Minya because of its beautiful riv-
erside cornice, friendly environment, 
bustling markets and few remaining 
ancient Egyptian monuments. Through 
the late 1970s and into the 1990s, vio-
lent Islamism was frequently linked to 
students of Minya University, and the 
town gained a reputation for breed-
ing terrorism. These days, according to 
several sources, tourists need constant 
security supervision. Our trip would be 
postponed a few weeks, until the end of 
the semester.

Horne and I had moved out of our 
apartment shortly before school fin-
ished and took up residence in a nearby 

hostel. During the move into the hostel, 
my cab driver tried to take me to the 
pyramids despite my insistence — in 
Arabic — that I knew where I wanted 
to go. The presence of backpacks auto-
matically signified to the driver that 
I needed someone to think for me, 
apparently. It took a bit of arguing — in 
Arabic — to return downtown. Over 

the next few days I 
got used to the cab 
drivers assaulting 
me outside of the 
hostel with offers 
to take me to the 
pyramids and the 
sphinx. If I didn’t 
know any better I 
would think that 

this was all Cairo had to offer.
After a few days of being treated like 

we had just arrived in the city, we were 
both finished with school. On May 29, 
just before 4 p.m., Horne, Kevin Staight 
and I met for the second time this 
semester at the Ramses Train Station 
downtown. The last time we had been 
trying to reach Gaza and found our-
selves detained by military police in 
Ismailia, 75 miles north of Cairo, after 
first being delayed by a train conductor 
strike. This time we would be heading 
153 miles south along the Nile River 
to Minya. 

Just as it had been during our trip to 
Gaza, we arrived at the station with min-
utes to spare before the train departed. 
Now, at the end of the semester and after 
various adventures, we weren’t phased 
by the lack of seats. Staight and Horne, 
true to form, quickly turned two empty 
baggage racks between cars into make-
shift beds. I took a spot on the floor 
with other seatless passengers, some in 
tan slacks and collared shirts, some in 
flowing gray galabeyas. Forty minutes 
later, with the train still at the plat-
form, Kevin quipped, “Is there another 
strike?” Minutes later we departed.

We were expecting a heavy security 
presence in the city, and the numerous 

uniformed army soldiers on the train 
confirmed our expectation. They were 
all young and wearing gray dress uni-
forms with metals and ribbons on their 
lapels. We arrived sometime after 9 
p.m., and two of the young men walked 
with us, chatting in English. They asked 
where we were from and why we would 
come to Minya. As we passed the tour-
ist police I was certain we would get out 
without a real escort. Instead, we were 
stopped at the door and asked to have a 
seat in the tourist information office.

As Horne chatted with the tourist 
police officer, who was trying to push 
tours and offering to find us a taxi and 
escort us around Minya, Staight and I

10 FOCUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, JUNE 2, 2008

By Joanna Cardenas
Staff Writer

Despite his circumstances, Jake Adams, pris-
oner H865983 of the Montford unit of the Texas 
Department of Criminal Justice, has found a 
glimmer of hope in the Books for Prisoners 
program run by UCSD student volunteers and 
facilitated by Groundwork Books. In a letter to 
program volunteers, Adams wrote, “Thank you 
so much for your time, help and understandin’  in 
offerin’ a program like this to us who are locked 
up.” Adams’ letter, just one of thousands tucked 
away in the back room of Groundwork Books 
from prisoners nationwide, echoes a collective 
interest in pursuing in-prison education that 
students are addressing.

Books for Prisoners, launched in 2001, 
was once an official, fully funded sector of 
Groundwork Books. This branch took on the 
sole responsibility of organizing and publicizing 
fundraisers and parties as well as soliciting book 
and monetary donations. According to Eleanor 
Roosevelt College senior and Groundwork staff 
member Adriana Goni, Groundwork Books cut 
funding for the program because of the difficul-
ties it has had sustaining itself against corporate 
competitors. 

With more than three times as many blacks 
living in prison cells than in college dorms 
according to 2006 U.S. Census data, however, 
dedicated volunteers like Thurgood Marshall 
College senior Brian Orozco have found it nec-
essary to breathe new life into this financially 
limited program. 

“[In the past couple of years,] we’ve had to 
dedicate a whole lot of time and energy to stay-
ing alive,” Goni said. “The problem still exists, 
though. There’s still a prison complex that profits 
off of slave labor and there’s a crazy dispro-
portionate amount of poor people of color in 
prison.”

One of the program’s main objectives has 

been to help prisoners combat this “prisoner 
industrial complex” by providing them with the 
tools needed to educate themselves. The com-
plex, an allusion to the term “military-industrial 
complex” coined by former president Dwight D. 
Eisenhower, refers to the growing profitability 
of the prison industry — headed by the vari-
ous vendors who do business with correctional 
institutions. This drive for profit is blamed for the 
shift in priorities away from rehabilitation and 
prisoner education programs. 

According to Goni, this mechanism is intend-
ed to keep prisoners uneducated — roughly 70 
percent of U.S. prisoners are illiterate.     

Groundwork Books provides prisoners with 
a book list from which they can choose two 
books completely free of charge. Because Books 
for Prisoners relies heavily on book donations 
from students, the types of books sent to pris-
oners vary. Usually, genres include race theory, 
cultural history, political economy and instruc-
tional materials. Receiving roughly 10-20 letters 
requesting books per week, mostly from prisons 
in the southwest, the most requested book is the 
dictionary. Orozco does not find this surprising 
given a prison’s lack of educational environment.

“That’s why this program exists. The educa-
tional opportunities in prison are dismal at best,” 
Orozco said. “Some of them offer classes, but you 
have to pay for [them] and you have to pay for 
your own books.”  

Although the role of Groundwork Books 
in the Books for Prisoners program has been 
reduced from all-encompassing involvement to 
merely providing shipping resources, the store 
still conducts a fundraiser at the beginning of 
each quarter called “Rounding up Change.” Staff 
members encourage students to either donate 
their loose change or round their purchases up to 
the nearest whole dollar. Further fundraising and 
advertising for the program has fallen on a group 
of 10 eager volunteers, headed by Orozco.

Orozco’s involvement in the cause happened 
by chance. After wandering into Groundwork 
Books his eyes stumbled on a piece of art-
work of several sketches of Chicano imagery. 
After inquiring about the artwork, staff members 
brought Orozco into the back room and showed 
him the thousands of prisoner letters, informing 
him of the program they used to have. From that 
day forward, Orozco took on the daunting task 

of reinstating the program and generating 
enough funds to cover the cost of ship-
ping. 

“The thing that kills me most is the 
educational opportunities in prison and 
I really want to do something about it,” 
Orozco said. “Although [these prisoners] 
have committed a crime, society takes a 
lot out of them, too, without giving them 
any resources to excel once they’re out.” 

Since last February, Orozco has orga-
nized and orchestrated two prisoner art 
shows — the most recent this past April. 
For the show, Orozco solicited artwork 
and biographical information from 
over 50 prisoners and 10 UCSD stu-
dents. Some artwork, intricate patterns 
done in dark ink and bright colors, 
looked the part of professional cre-
ations. Others, demonstrating the lack 
of artistic resources at some prisons, 
were sketched onto the very envelopes 
used to send book requests. The body 
of work also included woodwork 
and hand-crafted jewelry — like the 
hand-dyed, rope crucifix that Orozco 
wears around his neck, a gift from 
prisoner Douglas Durham.

A former inmate, a prisoner of five dif-
ferent prisons throughout New Jersey and 
New York over the span of 10 years, also 
attended the show to answer questions 
and draw portraits. With attendance sur-
passing 200, Orozco raised $1,600 for the 
Books for Prisoners program.

“The best part of the artwork is that 
you get to see prison through their eyes. 
You really get to see them for who they 
really are — people,” Orozco said. “I’m 
not going to lie, when I thought of 
prisoners before this, I thought of all of 
those negative stereotypes. Then, you 
start reading their letters and seeing 
their artwork and you realize that these 
are real people with skills.”

Removing the social stigma 
attached to prisoners is another motive 
for continuing the program, Orozco said.

Orozco created a project last fall that 
taught his residents about life behind 
bars and simultaneously took advan-
tage of their packaging manpower. 
Orozco shared the personal corre-
spondence he maintains with three 
prisoners in particular — Willy Jones 
in North Carolina, Durham in Texas 
and Richard Rodriguez in Bakersfield, 
Calif. Despite the shocking tales of 
prison rape and gang rivalries, most 
prisoners’ primary desire is to have the 
opportunity to walk away with some-
thing after serving their terms.

“The biggest thing for [my resi-
dents] was that they’re students and 
[are] forced to read books, but these 
guys genuinely want to read, they’re 
dying to read, they need these books,” 
Orozco said.  

The group of 20 residents ulti-
mately wrapped 189 packages for the 
Books for Prisoners program with 
a small budget from Sixth College. 
Following Orozco’s lead, RAs from 
Thurgood Marshall College and John 
Muir College hosted the same type of 
program for their residents to benefit 
Books for Prisoners.

Due to the success of the art shows 
and RA programs, Orozco, who gradu-
ates this year, said he hopes to leave 
Groundwork Books with an official 
university club fully equipped with vol-
unteers as dedicated to inmate-educa-
tion awareness as he is.

“I’d like to think that every book 
[we] send gives a prisoner the oppor-
tunity to make something of himself 
and to get out of that hole,” Orozco 
said. “It’s a hole made to keep people 
there and [we] just want to give them 
the rope to get them out.”

Editor’s Soapbox

By Matthew McArdle
Managing Editor

I remember the first time I 
walked into the Guardian offices on 
the second floor of Student Center. 
It was four years ago and I was 
a wide-eyed freshman responding 
to an ad calling for copy readers. 
Entering the office, I met a group 
of editors who looked me up and 
down and referred me to the appli-
cation box. A week later, after an 
interview and a grammar test, I 
was hired.

And so I settled in somewhat 
awkwardly at the student news-
paper, reading copy twice weekly 
for minimum wage — which I was 

really happy about, considering I 
had no idea the Guardian paid 
its employees when I decided to 
join. Usually keeping to myself and 
wearing my hoodie, I would sit at a 
corner computer in the production 
office on Wednesdays and Sundays, 
putting in my time to correct “its” 
versus “their” and mastering the 
nuances of Associated Press style.

This was my routine for about 
a year, until a miscommunication 
issue erroneously led me to believe 
I was being approached to apply 
for the vacant position of associate 
news editor. 

Although I eventually found out 
the Guardian higher-ups weren’t 
courting me specifically, I applied 

anyway and after another round 
of interviews found myself with 
the title of “editor,” which was a 
little nerve-wracking considering I 
hadn’t written a single story for the 
newspaper when I got the job.

But that push was all I needed 
to realize that the Guardian was 
my home. Year after year, each 
time I hammered out a last-minute 
interview, guided a writer through 
edits, thought of a riveting head-
line or reviewed a PDF at 2 a.m., 
I became more and more attached 
to the paper and everything that 
comes with it: an understanding of 
campus politics, culture and issues 
that affect students on an every-
day basis. Plus, there’s that quasi-

voyeuristic sense of pleasure that 
occurs when you see people read-
ing your column in lecture, oblivi-
ous to the fact you’re sitting right 
next to them.

I’m beyond lucky to have found 
the Guardian, and my editorship 
next year will undoubtedly be an 
adventure. Charles, you’ve shown 
me the meaning of dedication and 
the highs — and lows — that inevi-
tably accompany such a position, 
so let me be the first to admit that 
you’ll be a tough act to follow. But 
I’m definitely ready. And to the 
2008-09 staff, let’s do it.

E from grade-changing discrepancies at 
the Preuss School to controversial revi-
sions of the campus’ free-speech policy, 
alleged by some to be unconstitutional.

When these cases arise, the commu-
nications office prioritizes transparency 
above all else, Spector said.

“The most important aspect of deal-
ing with any issue is openly presenting 
all the facts, and discussing the issue 
thoughtfully with interested parties, 
including reporters,” she said. “When 
the leadership is confronted with a situ-
ation that may be perceived negatively 
at first glance, we work collectively to 
gather all the facts and develop a plan to 
present the most accurate and current 
information without violating privacy 
or policy regulations.”

Spector said administrators have 
demonstrated this transparency through 
open press conferences and town-hall 
meetings with key campus leaders, both 
after the discovery of damaging infor-
mation — such as the university audit 
that revealed administrative misman-
agement at the Preuss School — and 
situations in which the campus seeks 
to clear up rumors or reach out to the 
student body, as with the upcoming U.S. 
Open golf tournament or the wildfires 
that raged through the San Diego area 
last year.

Even when UCSD is not focused 
on damage control, communications 
officials are consistently battling nega-
tive perceptions about the campus on an 
individual basis, White said. She cited a 
common complaint illuminated in the 
2005 Undergraduate Student Experience 
and Satisfaction report that UCSD lacks 
a well-developed social scene, counter-
ing that her transition to the marketing 
arena made her more aware of options 
available for students to maximize their 
undergraduate experiences.

“We are very academically focused, 
but that doesn’t mean UCSD is ‘boring,’” 

White said. “You just have to make your 
own fun. Being on the ‘other side’ has 
really changed my perspective about 
how important it is to get involved as a 
student and to find that fun.”

UCSD is currently soliciting student 
responses for a 2008 update to the USES 
report, the results of which may indicate 
whether the school’s image among its 
student body has since changed as a 
result of this marketing overhaul.

In addition, White and Spector 
agreed that achieving support from 
alumni is a primary objective for com-
munications officials, both to bolster 
UCSD’s reputation and procure dona-
tions to maintain the quality of campus 
life. According to data released by the 
Alumni Association earlier this year, 
alumni donations to the University 
of California have fallen slightly over 
the last two years, following a 10-year 
upward trend, further emphasizing the 
need for a positive campus image.

 “Students today are alumni tomor-
row, and I want to make sure students 
are connected to the university while 
they are here and stay connected after 
they leave,” White said.

Despite the challenges inherent in 
maintaining a positive national image, 
Spector said she believes the campus’ 
profile is consistently improving.

“UC San Diego maintains a stellar 
academic reputation,” she said. “This is 
validated by the fact that UCSD attracts 
the best and the brightest students, top 
faculty experts in their fields, contin-
ues to be a place where cutting-edge 
research is applied to find discoveries 
and solutions to some of the world’s 
most challenging issues of global warm-
ing and health care — and where inno-
vation along with an entrepreneurial 
and collaborative spirit is highly encour-
aged.”

played with a light-up  map of the area 
on the wall. We flipped switches meant 
to turn on lights and highlight sights. 
The board had clearly been inoperable 
for decades. The officer escorted us 
down the street to a cheap hotel where 
we managed to get a room for about 
$10 a night.

The hotel, much like the tourist 
office, had fallen into disrepair. A foun-
tain in the back courtyard was dry and 
collapsing. The walls were filthy and its 
blue paint was chipped. The hotel was 
quiet and seemed to me as though it 
was unused. We dropped our stuff in 
a room on the third floor and headed 
out.

At the door, the security pressed 
us on our schedule and we repeat-
edly explained that we only wanted 
to wander and to see the town. After 
some debate we were able to sign a 
sheet of paper stating in Arabic that 
we declined security, and felt safe to 
wander Minya.

We were expecting a conservative 
town, much like the Islamic quarters 
of Cairo, but the crowds in the streets 
reminded us more of a university 
town in the more liberal Luxor. At one 
point, Horne jokingly compared it to 
Beirut, Lebanon, where nightclubs and 
Westernized dress are in high demand. 

That night at the bar, we discussed 
the likelihood that conservative move-
ments would spring from liberal areas 
and that our expectations of Egypt had 
been consistently shattered since arrival. 
On our way out, Horne was pulled into 
a hushed conversation with a fellow 
patron who offered him antiquities if he 
returned at 11 a.m.

We hardly slept. The room was sti-
flingly hot and despite a full can of bug 
spray I was eaten alive. Buzzing and 
itching kept me awake. The air condi-
tioner spewed heat. The camel blanket 
on the bed scratched but provided my 
only layer of protection from the grow-

ing bug population.
The next morning we headed down-

stairs and were greeted by six tourist 
police in dull, milky-brown uniforms. 
They were intent on knowing our plans. 
After some debate we managed to sign 
another waiver, this time in English, 
saying we wished to wander Minya 
alone and felt safe. We grabbed food 
and headed back to the bar to meet 
with the black-market antiquities dealer. 
However, our curiosity about the dark, 
hushed corners of ancient Egyptian 
historical preservation remained only 
curiosities. He never showed.

We wandered Minya for most of the 
day, up onto the hillside and through 
the desert. We walked along the cornice, 
which stretched five kilometers along a 
lush and wide Nile River. We wandered 
through a market where we shared tea 
with some of the locals. 

Around 4 p.m., we headed to the 
train station and started our journey 
back north. We would have two more 
stops, full of bugs, heat and without 
showers. In Al Fayoum, just southwest 
of Cairo, we weren’t able to shake the 
police escorts and our trip ended with 
a damper. Nevertheless, at each stop we 
discovered more of Egypt and crum-
bled predetermined images of where 
we visited.

As I arrived at my friend’s apart-
ment where I had left my belongings 
three days earlier, I felt like a wreck. 
Her apartment was spotless and I was 
anything but. I thought, as I entered 
the room, that perhaps the trip wasn’t 
worth the trouble, the pain or the effort. 
But just like our February trip to Gaza, 
it was an experience I will remember. It 
shaped how I look at Egypt, the country 
where I spent the last year studying 
and that still has so much left for me 
to discover.

at but ninth or tenth in all of the rest.”
Being a national champion as only 

a sophomore would seem to be more 
than enough of an accomplishment, 
but for Rainwater, the bar had been set 
even before she set foot at UCSD. As an 
incoming freshman, Rainwater made 
it her season goal to set the all-time 
UCSD heptathlon mark in her very 
first collegiate meet. Those are lofty 
expectations for some, but not for the 
very talented and highly self-motivated 
Rainwater. She made her presence felt 
on the college track circuit in the exact 
way that she had hoped by accomplish-
ing that goal, but as the year went on 
she had to learn to deal with different 
obstacles both on and off the track.

“Last year was a lot of transition-
ing between high school and college,” 
Rainwater said. “I was really happy with 
the season but I still had to get used to 
college, which was a big transition for 
me. I mean, there were no leftovers in 
the fridge waiting for me when I got 
home and there was nobody to tell me 
to get eight hours of sleep. I had to learn 
how to take care of myself.” 

Despite presenting a fantastic debut 
for UCSD, Rainwater did not end the 
year at the national finals, missing the 
qualifying mark by 10 points. Always 
optimistic and resilient, she did not let 
the disappointing end tarnish her rook-
ie season — instead, she used the rela-
tive failure to make herself realize her 
need to improve for this season. In her 
second year with the Tritons, Rainwater 
revamped her training schedule and 
worked even harder, a determination 
that paid off to the tune of a gold medal 
and national recognition. 

Before becoming a heptathlete, 
Rainwater competed primarily in the 
long jump and hurdles, two specializa-
tions that made her transition to the 
heptathlon successful. 

“It works out to my advantage 

because high jump and hurdles are nor-
mally the events that people have the 
most trouble with,” she said. “Those are 
the two events that are the most techni-
cal, so you can’t just wing it.”

Aside from the athleticism needed 
to even finish the heptathlon, staying 
focused for so many events and two 
entire days adds a level of difficulty 
unparalleled by any other sport.

“I feel like a heptathlon is really 
hard mentally because no matter how 
badly you do in one event you still have 
to keep going,” Rainwater said. “There 
are two days when you have to stay 
focused, and that’s really tough mentally 
because if you do bad in an event then 
you almost want to just give in and stop. 
My coaches have taught me to take each 
event individually.”

With a national championship 
and an all-time school record under 
Rainwater’s belt after only two years, 
what is possibly left for her to accom-
plish? Aside from wanting to help her 
team improve upon its best-ever fourth 
place finish at nationals, she can only 
see one final goal to push toward. 

“What motivates me now? I want 
to try out for the London Olympics in 
2012. I probably wouldn’t make it but 
setting my goals that high gives me 
something to go after and in trying to 
reach that mark I can only keep doing 
great things along the way. I have a feel-
ing that I have what it takes to get to the 
Olympic trials. You never know when 
somebody would get sick or something 
and a spot opens up for you.”

With all of the success that Rainwater 
has had in her short career in college 
competition, and as a person who is 
never content with allowing herself or 
her team to finish short of their poten-
tial, there is no reason to think that any 
goal is out of reach.

During the varsity four Grand Final, 
the Vikings grabbed an early lead to 
eventually take the gold with a time 
of 7:57.54. 

The varsity eight Grand Final 
proved to be a closer battle, as all 
four crews — Western Washington, 
Philadelphia University, Dowling 
College and UCSD — each hit 
the 500-meter mark within three 
seconds. But the Vikings pushed 
through the pack, forcing UCSD and 
Dowling College to fight for second 
place. At the midway point, the 
Tritons trailed the Golden Lions by 
three seconds and continued neck-
and-neck pursuit. In the final 1,000 
meters, UCSD exploded toward the 
finish line with a time of 7:06.68 to 
trump Dowling’s 7:10.19. 

“The cool part about it was that 

we went into the race and we had a 
really great sprint at the last 1,000 
meters,” Chang said. “We really want-
ed to attack the first and second 500, 
and ultimately, we had the strongest 
race this program has ever seen. This 
is probably the fastest boat this pro-
gram has ever had and that’s what 
makes it amazing. We were really 
going for Dowling on our right side 
and we battled them throughout the 
race.Toward the end, we opened up 
and really just crushed them.”

At the awards ceremony on June 
1, the Tritons were announced as the 
National Runners-Up and awarded 
two silver plaques, honors that add 
to UCSD’s already established team 
history. Although the season ended 
with some serious hardware, the 
Tritons are sad to see the season 
come to an end. 

“It’s a bittersweet day for us 
because while it is the crowning 
of our achievement, it’s also the 
last time that our seniors row for 
UCSD,” Pinkerton said. 

But with 11 of the 16 rowers on 
the championship roster returning 
for the 2008-09 season, the future 
looks bright for UCSD.

“The seniors were really proud to 
set up something for the girls who 
will come next,” Chang said. “We’ve 
set goals and broken records. Every 
year we’ve done something that 
hasn’t been done before. As a team 
we’ve set these records and for the 
girls returning next year, the sky’s 
the limit. I know they can achieve 
anything they put their minds to.”

HOT CORNER

MONDAY, JUNE 2, 2008

By Brianna Lee
Staff Writer

WOMEN’S CREW — The waters of 
Lake Natoma in Rancho Cordova, 
Calif. welcomed the Tritons over 
the weekend as UCSD’s varsity eight 
and varsity four boats each seized 
first-place finishes during the first 
two days of the NCAA National 
Championships, qualifying the 
Tritons for the Grand Final on June 
1 and presenting them with a good 
position to lay claim to the national 
title. The championships, which 
began May 30, put UCSD’s var-
sity eight crew against Mercyhurst 
College and Nova Southeastern 
University. The Tritons, who crossed 
the finish line with a time of 7:02.89, 
never surrendered their first place 
lead, forcing the Mercyhurst Lakers 
and the NSU Sharks to follow in 
UCSD’s wake with times of 7:04.17 
and 7:41.20, respectively. The vic-
tory marked the first time ever that 
the Tritons advanced directly to the 
Grand Final.

The varsity eight squad includes 
junior coxswain Stephanie Chang, 
senior Kelsey Thomas (stroke), 
senior co-captain Jen Myers (seven-
seat), senior co-captain Kali Webb 

(six), junior Alissa Kispersky (five), 
freshman Denise Kleckner (four), 
junior Jill Peacock (three), senior 
Maureen Kantner (two) and senior 
Kim Shaffer (bow). Myers and 
Chang were named to the Division-
II Pocock All-American Team on 
May 24, an honor that can be cred-
ited to their leadership and key roles 
in piloting the squad to its fourth 
consecutive NCAA postseason 
appearance.

With such distinguished mem-
bers, the Triton’s first-place finish 
comes with little surprise. According 
to Webb, the team’s success can 
be attributed to the high level of 
confidence the rowers have in one 
another.

“When you’re at nationals, you 
know you’re competing with the 
best of the best and that anything 
can happen,” she said. “You have to 
trust that you are going to row the 
best you can and that the girls in 
the boat are going to row their best 
with you.”

For Shaffer, who was recently 
named a 2008 Scholar Athlete, the 
heat on May 30 marked one of 
team’s most triumphant races of the 
season. 

“For our crew, it was one of the 
best sprints that we’ve ever had,” she 
said. “It took us past Mercyhurst in 
the last several hundred meters and 
that was the highpoint of our race.” 

Mirroring the varsity eight’s 
explosive heat performance, the var-
sity four crew also put in solid fin-
ishes during the first two days of the 

NCAA National Championships, 
earning the rowers a thrilling 
final-day battle. On May 30, the 
squad took second behind three-
time defending champions Western 
Washington University with a time 
of 8:11.29.

As part of the new system, the 
Vikings advanced to the final race, 
leaving the Tritons to compete for 
a spot in the Grand Final by squar-
ing off in an eliminating race called 
a “repechage.” UCSD cruised to a 
wide 14-second victory and crossed 
the finish line with a time of 8:20.87 

after dominating the rest of the 
field.

“Our big competition is Western 
Washington,” freshman Kristen 
Hayashi said. “We were working 
really hard to push them away the 
way we’ll do for Washington. Today 
was a really good row to focus for 
[the finals].” 

The Tritons’ final battle came 
on June 1, day three of the national 
championships. At the peak of their 
season, the rowers were ready to 
give it everything they had.

“I think we will need to have the 

race of our lives,” head coach Pattie 
Pinkerton said before the final day 
of competition. “That’s exactly what 
we would expect to need at this 
level of competition. The girls had a 
great race on Friday, and both boats 
are ready to go out there and give it 
their all tomorrow.”

In the end, however, the Tritons 
closed out their 2008 season as 
national runners-up to the Vikings 
of Western Washington in both the 
varsity eight and varsity four races. 

Senior jumper Whitney Johnson has come a long way since her freshman year at UCSD. After playing three sports in high school, 
Johnson decided that she was ready to focus 
solely on academics and turned down offers to be 
a collegiate athlete. She got accepted to UCSD on 
her academic merit and was looking forward to 
a new experience, but the women’s track coach, 
Darcy Ahner, recognized something special in 
Johnson; she did not let Johnson walk away from 
the sport. 

“I thought I was done with sports and I just 
wanted to be a student for once,” Johnson said. 
“They tried to recruit me and I dodged Darcy all 
summer. I wouldn’t answer my phone, I wouldn’t 
call her back; I just tried to avoid her. She only 
caught me one time and it was when she called 

while I was sleeping and my mom put the phone 
up to my ear.”

Ahner eventually backed off from the recruit-
ing e-mails and calls, letting Johnson settle into 
her first quarter as a college student. Unfortunately 
for Johnson, and fortunately for Ahner, life as an 
average student wasn’t as thrilling as promised.  

“I got to UCSD and two months into school, 
after having already missed tryouts, I was just so 
bored,” Johnson said. “I talked to Darcy and she 
had me meet the team and I just started training 
after that.”

For the rest of the quarter, Johnson was given 
her own extended tryout with the team to make 
sure that she clicked with the rest of the athletes 

Competing in one track and field event at the collegiate level is hard enough. Making it to the NCAA Championships 
and winning a gold medal is even harder. Now 
imagine trying to win that gold medal while hav-
ing to compete in seven different events that cover 
all aspects of the sport. That is exactly what sopho-
more Linda Rainwater was able to accomplish last 
weekend on her way to UCSD’s first national gold 
medal in almost two decades.

Rainwater competes in the heptathlon, a track 
event that spans a two-day period and consists of 
each athlete earning points in seven events that 
get tallied together, with the highest point total 
after all events earning first place. Day one of the 
heptathlon sees each participant taking part in the 
100-meter hurdles, the high jump, the shot put 

and finish with the 200-meter sprint. The athletes 
have only 30 minutes to rest between each event. 
The final day of the heptathlon finishes with the 
long jump, the javelin and an 800-meter sprint to 
cap the competition. 

Although she was able to capture the national 
title in the heptathlon, Rainwater sees it more as a 
testament to her versatility and range as an athlete 
than to outright domination in any one event. 

“When I do the heptathlon you wouldn’t really 
think that I’m very good because I never really win 
any of the events, I just kind of get second or third 
in all of them,” she said. “By the end I’ve gotten 
around second in all of them but everybody else 
got first place in one thing that they’re really good
