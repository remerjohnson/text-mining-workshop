Senate proposes bond 
for seismic corrections 
By ANDREW KACHUR 

The California State Senate 
has proposed a 53S0 million 
bond measure for the Seismic 
Hazard Correction program 
for all state buildinlS, includ-
inl the University of Cali-
fornia. 

University of California 

Board of Relents has wel-
comed the action as part of 
UC's 1988-89 budletforcapi-
tal improvements. The bond 
measure, Senate Bill 88, has 
passed the Senate and still 
requires the approval of the 
Assembly and Governor Deuk-
mejian before it can appear on 
the 1988 ballot. Upon voter 

The seismic reinforcement of USB is being done with money 
separate from the bond issue. 

Over $2 Dillion asked for 

approval, the measure would 
provide 5350 million for seis-
mic hazard correction projects 
at all state buildinls and Uni-
versity of California build-
inlS· 

The University has been 
working since the 1970s to 
identify and correct both 
structural and non-structural 
seismic deficiencies in its build-
inlS. The work has included 
bracinl walls, adding reinforce-
ments to buildings, and rem-
ovinl hazardous exterior and 
interior ornaments. The 
newly proposed funding would 
greatly aid this venture. 

UCSD is already working 
on some seismic reinforcement 
projects. The Facilities, De-
sign, and Construction Depart- . 
·ment is in charle of detecting 
structural problems and solv-
ing them. For example, the 
U nderpaduate Sciences Build-
ina has experienced some CIlck-

Phys. ed. classes 
stay free of charge 
By NICOLE NEWLANDS 
Edit", lit CltkJ 

University officials decided last 
Tuesday not to reclassify Physi-
cal Education activity classes as 
recreation classes and conse-
quently charge additional fees 
for them as had been suuested 
by some members of the admin-
istration. 

ChanceUor Atkinson has recom-
mended some chanles in the 
structure of the P.E. department 
but it is unclear whether or not 
Atkinson suuested the reclassi-
fication of P.E. classes to recrea-
tion classes. 

According to Dr. Stanley 
Chodorow, dean of arts and 
humanities, Atkinson's recom-
mendations came as a result of 
the immense growth the depart-
ment has undergone in the 23 
years since its inception. 

Accordinl to Dave Marchick, 
Associated Students president, 
Atkinson has only been involved 
in the past few weeks. 

"Some - and I don't know 
who - administrators and fac-
ulty were interested in eliminat-
ing P. E. activity classes," 
Marchick said. "I have heard 
that the motive for this was to 
replace them with a more sub-

an opportunity to drastically 
change the P.E. department's 
functions by eliminating P.E. 
activity funds. 

Dr. Howard Hunt, acting chair 
ofthe P.E. department, said that 
the department will continue to 
hold the responsibility for teach-
ing P.E. courses. 

"I'm very pleased," Hunt said . 
"Activity classes should be part 
of general education. All students 
should have the chance to take a 
class and learn how to best take 
care of themselves here and after 
they graduate." 

Marchick met with Hunt to 
provide student input into the 
decision. 

"The A.S. 's stance is that 
activity classes should remain 
status quo," Marchick said . 
"Students are not interested in 
paying [for P.E. classes] and we 
feel that state supported classes 
are more beneficial." 

In addition to his recommend-
ation on the reclassification of 
P.E. classes, Atkinson also sug-
gested that responsibilities within 
the department be redefined.

"(Now] the P.E. department 
no longer runs recreation and 
intercolleliate athletics," 
Chodorow said. "Arts and hu-
manities is responsible for the 
P.E. department and its pro-
grams and [Watson] oversees 
recreation and intercolleliate 
athletics. "

By PETER MESSRORIAN 
N"",. EtIlt", 

The Board of Regents of the 
Univenity of Califomia have set 
the 1988-89 operating budget at 
SS.S billion, including a request 
for just over S2 billion in state 
money. 

The president of the U niver-
sity, David Gardner, and Gov-
ernor Deukmejian are currently 
nelotiatinl the state-funded 
portion of the budlet, which the 
lovernor will .present to the 
Lelislature sometime in Janu-
ary, accoring to John Woods, 
the acting vice chancellor of 
administration at UCSD. "The 
critical thing is to get projects in 
the lovenor's bud let right now, " 
Woods said. He added that the 
Legislature can both add and 
subtract items from the budget 
submitted to it by the lovernor, 
and it should pass a bud let by 
May of 1988. 

The budget is then sent back 
to Deukmejian, who may only 
subtract expenditures, not add 

them. The final budget should be 
approved before July, when the 
state's fiscal year begins. 

Among the requests made by 
the Relents are a 3 percent 
faculty salary increase and a 4.4 
percent student fee increase. The 
faculty salary increase, accord-
inl to Vice President fQr Budget 
and Univenity Relations William 
B. Baker, is based on projected 
salaries within a lfouP of eilht 
comparison institutions across 
the country. In a release, Baker 
called this request "one of the 
most critical components in our 
budget proposal ... [because] this 
will maintain our relative com-
petitive position in the academic 
marketplace ..... 

The student fee increase will 
result in an averale increase in 
educational and registration fees 
of S60 per year per UC student 
over this year's total fees. The 
average annual fee across the UC 
system will be $1,434 per stu-
dent. Exact filures were not 
available for UCSD. 

The U C budlet is divided into 

operating and capital expenses, 
with operatinl expenses consist-
inl primarily of fixed costs and 
including such items as price 
increases, merit pay increases, 
and the salary increases. Operat-
ina budgets for individual cam-
puses are "generic," accordinl to 
Actinl Vice Chancellor Woods, 
varying only in size, not iil what 
is payed for. 

Capital expenses include 
building improvements, new 
buildings, new equipment, and 
other physical improvements and 
additons. There are four stales 
involved in creating a new build-
ing: planninl, workinl drawings, 
construction, and equipment. 
Several requests have been made 
by UCSD to fund projects in 
some of these stales, according 
to Woods. 

Two new starts, or requesta 
for money for the planning stage, 
are the renovation of the Under-
graduate Sciences Buildinl 
(USB), and a new science build-
inl to be built just west of the

5150,000 raised for 
homeless Day Center 

A luncheon hosted by Mayor Mau-
reen O'Connor has raised 5150,000 
towards construction of a new Day 
Center for the homeless downtown. 
The money, donated by downtown 
business people, will be used along 
with $125,000 from the city and 
$100,000 from the county to build the 
center. 

"Our goal now is to raise another 
5375,000 to operate the center for the 
first three years," O'Connor said. "We 
badly need additional donations if the 
center is to be a success." 

Set for construction at 17th and J 
streets, the San Diego Day Center will 
provide homeless men with a safe 
place off the street. Shower, laundry 
facilities, telephones, storage and other 
services which arc vital to helping the 
homeless pull their lives together are 
among the center's proposed features. 

In addition to the other fundraising 
efforts, the First Annual Mayor's 
Benefit for the Homeless Concert is 
planned for Nov. 14 to raise needed 
money. 

The concert will feature the San 
Diego Youth Symphony and pianist 
Gustav Romero. The performances 
will begin at 7 pm in the Lyceum 
Theater in Horton Plaza. 

Those wishing to purchase tickets, 
or make a monetary contribution, can 
do so by contacting the Regional Task 
Force on the Homeless at 239-4800. 

Opportunities to travel

Continued from pale I 
his absence will be Marc Schuc-
kit, M.D., professor of psychia-
try and a head of the Alcohol 
Research Center at the Veterans 
Administration Medical Center 
in La Jolla. 

"This is a particularly exciting 
and opportune time to take on 
this challenge," Judd said. "The 
science of our field is rapidly 
emerging as one of the most 
exciting and fastest moving in all 
of biomedicine. I believe that 
Important and even revolution-
ary scientific insights in mental 
disorders are not only possible, 
but feasible in the foreseeable 
future . 

"The challenge of helping to 
lead and shape the federal effort 
in this very important scientific 
research is, at the same time, a 
very exciting and frankly hum-
bling prospect," he said. "I do 
feel a great responsibility as well 
to the millions of patients and 
their families in this country who 
suffer from these terribly dis-
abling and often lifelong dis-

the very best and highest quality 
scientific effort possible in pro-

of aAd solutions for the prob-

Continued from pale I 
lems. The Facilities, Design and 
Construction Department is 
making an effort to correct some 
lateral deficiencies and reinforce the 
building. 

This effort is independent of 
the new 5350 million bond mea-
sure being supported by the UC 
Regents. The new proposal is 
strongly backed by William B. 
Baker, vice-president for budget 
and university relations for the 
University of California. 

"Our guiding concern in seek-
ing and using funds for seismic 
strengthening work is the safety 
of students, faculty, staff, and 
members of the public who use 
University facilities ," Baker said. 
Progress has been slow because 
of the limited availability of 
funds. However, if the bond issue 
is approved, reconstruction 
would be sped up considerably. 

The office of the President of 
the University of California has 
informed UCSD officials of the 
upcoming Seimic Hazard Cor-
rection program. The funds for 
reconstruction will be distributed 
between all the UC campuses. 
The seven page communique 
from the Office of the President 
does not delineate how the Uni-
versity of California plans to dis-
tribute funds at this time. How-
ever, it is known that each uni-
versity campus will be expected 
to forward a list of buildings 
that need seismic correction. The 
Office of the President will then 
coordinate the funding and re-
construction efforts of the indi-
vidual University campuses. 

UCSD will submit its needs 
through the Facilities, Design. 
and Construction Department. 
M. Boone Hellman, Assistant 
Director of Design, will be a 
decision maker in UCSD's seis-
mic reconstruction program. 
"The University will have quali-
fied consultants working on this 
project to decide on the build-
ing's seismic code conformance."

Mental health leaders around 

the country praised the ap-
pointment. "I am delighted at 
this remarkable, indeed, exhi-
larating appointment. Under Dr. 
Judd's leadership, the NIMH will 
move even further into the scien-
tific vanguard for all of mental 
illness and mental health," said 
Melvin Sabshin, M.D., medical 
director for the American Psy-
chiatric Association. "He is one 
of our leading psychiatrists, a 
superb academician and re-
searcher, and he has great fore-
sight in the formulation of 
policy. " 

David Kupfer, M.D., chair-
man of psychiatry at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, called Judd 
"one Of the most distinguished 
clinical researchers and acade-
micians in the field of psychiatry 
today. " 

Said Kupfer: "He is a very 
strong and successful advocate 
for first-class basic and clinical 
research, as well as in research 
training, and for the overall mis-
sion of mental health. He is a 
superb role-model for younger 
clinical scientists." 

Shervert Frazier, M.D., former 
director of the NIMH and now 
general director/ psychiatrist in 
chief of McLean Hospital in 
Belmont, Mass., said Judd "pos-
sesses an unmatched combina-

tion of experience and insight. 
His intimate knowledge of the 
NI M H - its goals, its mission, 
its internal workings - and his 
research and leadership abilities 
will serve him well in his new 
position ... 

Commenting on Judd's ability 
to move quickly into the job, 
Fred Goodwin, M.D., scientific 
director of NIMH, said, "Lew 
has been closely involved with 
policy issues at NIM H for many 
years. Because of his deep and 
broad-based understanding of 
our science base, he can hit the 
ground ~unning. "

became chair of the medical 
school department and chief of

LfTTfHSLfTTfHSlfTlfHSlfTlfHSlflTfHS 
Speech team successful 
but instruction unstable 
Editor: 

I would like to make a few 
comments regarding Samantha 
Beigel's article on the speech and 
debate team here at UCSD. First, 
I commend her for a long-over-
due look at the importance of 
collegiate forensics and com-
munication sk ills . Both speech 
and debate can play large roles in 
building confidence of speaking, 
which is necessary upon entering 
almost every job. 

Secondly, I wish to clarify 
some of the points made. The 
speech and debate team is not a 
'new' organization; it has been 
around for about four years. 
V nfortunately, we have had a 
small budget and participated in 
few events . I should point out 
that while the debate team only 
went to one tournament each of 
the past two years, it reached 
quarterfinal rounds in each 
tournament against more sea-
so ned competitors such as 
SDS V, Cal Poly, and VCLA. 
This was accomplished without 
the help of a large forensics pro-
gram, and without the aid of 
forensics c1as es. 

Third , there has been one 
speech class taught in the past at 
UCSD, under the direction of 
Palomar College's Pat Mills. 
Unfortu nately, this class was 
shelved in the literature depart-
ment. The new extension class 
and administration support is a 
step in the right direction; for a 
strong forensics program to exist, 
however, we need several classes 
in a regular department (such as 
communications or theatre). 
More participation in speech and 
debate can be achieved only if 
there is some incentive; those of 
us who do it for the challenge are 
a special breed. Congratulations 
to Robert Baracl and Chris Ste-
fanidis, my partner Steve Gold-
berg, and our three female 
teammates, who outclassed us 
all at CSUN. Thanks also to 
Kathy Waste, who made this 
year possible. 

I encourage students, regard-
less of major, to join the growing 
forensics program. We need your 
interest and support to keep the 
team strong in competition, es-
pecially in debate, where the more 
dedicated students we have, the 
easier it will be to excel. Speech 
and debate is a fun, educational, 
and excit ing challenge; it's well 
worth the time.

of the Guardian . SSAP was 
implemented this year at UCSD 
under the office of the Vice 
Chancellor of Undergraduate 
Affairs to raise consciousness 
and awareness and provide edu-
cation about date rape, rape, 
personal safety, and sexual har-
assment. 

Regularly scheduled aware-
ness, prevention, education, and 
training programs arc held 
throughout the year on those 
topics. They include workshops 
and presentations for resident 
and commuter students, R.A.s 
and T.A.s. Students may arrange 
for special or specific programs 
by contacting Mary Virga at the 
SSAP office, Bldg. B, Student 
Center, 534-5793. 

SSAP also publishes, provides 
and disseminates written mate-
rial on student safety issues. Two 
recently published brochures 
dealing with date rape and sex-
ual harassment are available at 
SSAP, on the shuttles, and 
throughout campus. (Call SSAP 
for those 10CDtions). 

With regard to dark areas 
around construction sites and 
other locations on campus, SSAP 
has advised administration, who 
is making every effort to elimi-
nate problem areas. SSAP re-

Contra debate coverage 
accuracy is questioned 
Editor: 

When I picked up your last 
issue I was pleased to sec an arti-
cle titled "Contra aid debate plays 
to full house" right there on the 
front page. How wonderful that 
the Guardilln Ilhould see fit to 
grant such prime space to cover-
age of that debate, I thought to 
myself. I had attended the debate 
and found it highly entertaining 
and informative. 

After reading Guardian staff 
writer Leticia Villarreal's account 
of the debate, however, I was left

feeling angry and bitter. Ms. Vil-
larreal had presented a seriously 
distorted version of what actu-
ally took place that night between 
two supporters of continued U.S. 
aid to the contras and two oppo-
nents of further aid to the 
counter-revolutionaries. I 
couldn't help but recall that less 
than two weeks ago, the very 
same writer had covered the 
appearance on campus of a man 
who the Young Americans for 

. Freedom claimed was the offi-
cial West Coast representative of 
tne Nicaraguan "freedom figh-
ters." I had attended that event, 
as well, and considered Villa-
rreal's "coverage" (Guardian, 
11/19/87) to have been little 
more than 'the regurgitation of 
the Contra/ CIA line. 

this fact because ofthe high level 
of audience participation. 
Nevertheless, Villarreal gives just 
the opposite impression in her 
article. The only reference she 
makes to audience reaction to 
the arguments of the speakers is 
when she says that members of 
the crowd were laughing at one 
of Dr.Bonpane's response. 

But let us return to the in-
accuracies, distortions and omis-
sions in Villarreal's article on the 
contra aid debate. First of all, 
Villarreal does not mention that 
an overwhelming number of the 

Villarreal claims in the article 
that Dr. Bonpane answered the 
third and final question of the 
debate (Should the V .S. fund the 
Contras?) with a song. She's 
wrong on a couple of counts 
here. It is true that at one point 
during the debate, Dr. Bonpane, 
a former Maryknoll priest, chose 
to share a Nicaraguan song with 
the audience because he felt it 
would more adequately com-
municate the truth about the 
advances made by Nicaragua's 
revolution than a hundred ra-
tional arguments. But it is a 
grOIS falsehood to state that Bon-
pane broke out in a song to 
anllwer this third question. In 
fact, it was Mr. Wolf who pro-
vided an eloquent and histori-
cally informed answer to this 
question, for which he was ap-

I SO plus people in attendance 
clearly favored the arguments of 
Messrs, Bonpaneand Wolf, who 
opposed aid to the Nicaraguan 
counterrevolutionaries, or Con-
tras. It was impossible to misl See LETTERS, pale 5

again, is blatant distortion. What 
Bonpane said th.t the five Cen-
tral American nations who ligned 
the so-called Arias Peace Plan 
distinguished in the language of 
their treaty between "irregular 
forcel" and "insurgent forces," 
the principal difference bein, that 
"insurgent" enjoy genuine grass 
roots support from the people of 
their country, while "irregular 
forces" (like the Contru) arc 

imposed from without. The sig-
natories of that treaty, not Dr. 
Bonpane, arc the ones who 
"denied that the Contras arc an 
insurgent force."

Budget 
Continued from pale 1 
open area between Urey Hall 
and the gym. The completed 
USB project will cost about 56.7 
million, and the new science 
building, intended to house bi-
ology and chemistry faculty, will 
ultimately cost approximately 
548 million. 

The money needed to make 
working drawings ofthe planned 
addition to Central Library has 
also been requested, in addition 
to the funds for a S26 million 
expansion and modification of 
the UCSD Medical Center in 
Hillcrest. 

"We're pleased with what we've 
included [in the budget]," Woods 
said, "though we always have 
mixed emotions . .. our needs are 
much, much greater [than the 
funds we've requested]." 

"The state will not entertain a 
proposal until need is shown, so 
by definition there is a lag built-
in [to the budget process]," 
explained Woods. In other 
words, if a campus predicts a 
need for a building 10 years 
down the road, the state will not 
fund the building until that need 
actually exists, 10 years later. 

Among the many programs 
requested by the Regents are 
(items are systemwide requests 
unless otherwise noted): 

• SI.TI million for 83 addi-
tional teaching assistant posti-
tions, 

• Sl million each for research 
on astronomy, robotics, and earth-
quakes, 

• S2.7 million to expand cur-
rent affirmative action programs 
and start two new ooes, 

• new construction to house 
social science programs at Davis, 
chemistry and biological scien-
ces at UCLA, animal care pro-
grams at lJerkeley, the science 
library at Santa Cruz, and aca-
demic space for College Eight at 
Santa Cruz. 

The remaining S3.5 billion of 
the U niveristy budget comes from 
a variety of sources, including 
federal money, private contribu-
tions, fees and tuition money, 
and others. In addition, the fed-
eral government supplies the 52.2 
billion budget of the three 
national laboratories - Los 
Alamos, Lawrence Livermore, 
and Lawrence Berkeley - push-
ing the total UC budget for 1988-
89 to just over 57.7 billion. lID

and so many of our buildings 
have been built within the last 25 
years, in accordance -to newer

Most ofUCSDwas built under 
modern building standards and

buildings are generally safer and 
have decreased resistance to lat-
eral movement. The modern 
seismic protection technologies 
have insulated most of UCSD 
buildings from earthquake dam-
age. But older UC campuses, like 
Berkeley and UCLA, have older 
buildings and will therefore need 
more attention from the Seismic

New prof expands scope of communication 
Drake stresses the need for a global perspective 

By GAYATRI L.G. 

Wearing a formal gray Harris 
tweed jacket and tic for his initial 
j ob interview, William Drake was 
pleasantly surprised to find the 
UCSD communications depart-
ment faculty dressed in T-shirts 
and shorts. He remembers think-
ing, "This is a good environ-
ment. People are relaxed ." 

Drake, who joined the UCSD 
communicat ions department in 
September, believes that this 
attitude carries over to other 
aspects of life. "People [in the 
communications department] arc 
very open to discussing issues in 
a very broad way. There isn't any 
kind of presumption that there's 
a right or wrong methodology, 
or anyone analytical approach 
to take, and if you don't , then 
you're out of the mainstream 

and not acceptable," he said . 
Drake said that the depart-

ment of communicat io ns :it 
UCSD is considered to be one of 
the best in the country. "The 
decision to look at communica-
tion as a separate area of social 
science was slow to crystallize in 
the United States, and commun-
ication studies used to be frag-
mented. You would find people 
in political science, sociology, 
anthropology, looking at com-
munications issues from differ-
ent angles, but it was only re-
ce ntly that it has crystallized as a 
se parate d iscipline," he ex-
plained. 

" Among the departments that 
have been created, this is one of 
the best. [UCSD] is fairly strong 
in all of the major areas and 
major subfields of commu ni -
cations. " 

William Drake expresses his satisfaction with the communica-
tions department's theoretical and practical approach toward 
understanding the role of communication in society.

He discussed some of the as-
pects which makes UCSD espe-
cially appealing to him as a place 
at which to continue his research 
and instruction. "UCSD is uni-
que in that while it can train 
people with a practical orienta-
tion , it is strong in viewing com-
munication as a social science, 
and trying to explain the role of 
communications in society from 
a theoretical perspective ... [It] is 
one of the up-and-coming cam-
puses in the country. With the 
projected expansion of social 
science, UCSD looks very, very 
promising. Also, in the larger 
community there are a lot of 
good people around because of 
this new school of international 
relations, and Pacific Rim. It 's a 
good academic environment. 

"As far as students are con-
cerned, there's a real commit-
ment to them in this department. 
It seems that UCSD's communi-
cations department cares more 
about teaching than other major 
research institutions." He added, 
"I think all the people in this 
department have a real concern 
for and commitment to the events 
that are going on in the real 
world . I think we feel teaching is 
an important way to make stu-
dents more informed and capa-
ble of jUdging for themselves 
what 's happening out there. 
That's why I teach ." 

As a teacher, Drake has cer-
tain expectations of his students. 
He advises students to enter his 
classes with some analytical skills 
in order to make sense of the 
changes that are occurring in the 
world. He wants them to be able 
to effectively seek legitimate

people understand the conse-
quences of what we do abroad, 
because we're living in an in-

pendent world and we can't walk

Drake grew up in Chicago and 
attended Northwestern Univer-
sity, where he was extremely 
active politically. Politics fasci-
nated him. His political invol-
vement stemmed from "being 
interested in what's going on in 
the world , and how events affect 
people." 

During his graduate studies at 
Columbia University, Drake 
wrote a paper on the role of 
information as a form of power 
in international politics. This 
paper was instrumental in 
Drake's decision to pursue com-
munication as a career. While 
writing the paper, Drake realized 
that if he really wanted to get at 
what was causing crucial cha nges

in the international political 
economy, he would have to study 
major communications informa-
tions industries. 

Drake feels that the computer 
is the key to all the events that 
have been taking place as a part 
of the information revolution 
and the change to a world infor-
mation economy. 

Drake described the effects on 
the communication industry 
brought about by the ability of 
telecommunications to link 
computers. "The revolution that 
is taking place in the world 
economy has to do with the 
technological and economic 
changes that are taking place in 
telecommunications and com-
puters . These industries are 
infra-structures, they're woven 
into every sector oft he economy, 
and since they're being used more 
and more, the changes that are 
taking place in these areas are

New trend in San Diego nightUfe 

The Playskool event 
it's more than just a club 

By REBECCA JAURIGUE 
St4 Wrlle, 

Checkered picnic tablecloths, 
dismembered mannequins, flash-
ing Christmas lights ... Ministry, 
Madonna, Motley Crue ... these 
are a few sights and sounds at 
Playskool, one of San Diego's 
most successful clubs. 

About 800 peoplc:, attired in 
anything from black leather to 
black tie, appear at Playskool, a 
club which is open on certain 
Friday nights in the cavernous 
basement of Hotel San Diego. 

Stylish and dance-feverish surf-
ers, artists and students mingle . 
near the silhouette of a OJ who 
stands within a pyramid and red 
parachute. Near the bar, a line of 
military men in Levis and but-
toned-down shirts watch Eddie 
Murphy's video, "Delirious" 
flicker across a big screen. Girls 
wearing black fishnet stockings 
wander through the rooms of 
" Playskool" selling boxes of 
"Cracker Jacks." 

Todd Zweig, 23, who runs 
Playskool, said, "This is the only 
place I know where all different 
kinds of people can go - and 
not feel uncomfortable." 

With a melange of dance 
music, a full bar for those over 
21 , and a non-alcoholic bar for 
the 18-up crowd, Zweig notes 

that Playskool has firmly estab-
lished itself in San Diego. At 
Playskool's first year anniversary 
on Oct. 9, Zweig opened another 
Ooor of the hotel for his club to 
accommodate the 1,000 people 
in attendance. Playskool's 57 
tuition now includes a compli-
mentary Oute of champagne. 

Playskool is more of an event 
than a club. Zweig says that if he 
moved Playskool's location

ple would follow. 

people would follow. A few days 
before each event, he decorates 
the hotel in a different theme, 
using anything from paper plates 
to black crosses for decore. He 
also invites performances artists 
- jugglers, body painters, and 
mimes to keep the people enter-
tained. By scheduling Playskool 
intermittently, people plan for 
the event. 

"If people don't go to a date of 
Playskool," Zweig said , "they re-

alized they missed out. It's not 
the same every time ... 

Zweig graduated from San 
Diego State earlier this year with 
a degree in business. "( started 
the club during my last year," he 
recalled . ""All my teachers said I 
was the strangest-looking busi-
ness student they had." 

Zweig shrugs, his black jacket 
in contrast to his blond asymet-
rically hair cut, hanging in slight 
waves on one side. "All the other 
students were worried about IBM 
or PacTel and being trans-
ferred ... I didn't have to." Zweig 
said that he definitely uses his 
business education in his club 
venture, with 35 employees, in-
cluding DJs, bartenders, and se-
curity people. He adds that the 
Hotel San Diego has been very 
supportive of Playskool. 

Ironically Zweig is about the 
only one at the event who doesn't 
have time to enjoy the music. "In 
a sense, I've never been to Plays-
kool. I'm always working as it 
goes on. It's wild, knowing that 
you can give the people what 
tbey want . . .. he said. 

Playskool will be in session 
again on Friday, Dec. II , at the 
Hotel San Diego, 339 Broadway 
downtown. 

New ownership recently took 
over the hotel , which is in the

Zweig may not look like your typical business student, but Playskool 
proves that he's learned his lessons well.

process of remodeling, so Zweig 
plans to move Playskool to 
another location by January. 

However, the new owner -
who is currently waiting for 
approval of his liquor license -
tried to cancel Playskool's last 
event there, scheduled for Dec. 
11. According to Zweig, "non-
valid.ted noise complaints"were 

cited, and he plans to file a court 
injunction whereby he might hold 
the club there next. 

Zweig also runs other "events" 
similar to Playskool such as 
Detention, another dance club, 
held every Wednesday night at 
Club Mirage in Mission Valley. 

Beginning Dec. 12, every Sat-
urday night at 555 Union Street, 
there will be another club, still 
unnamed. 

"I'm thinking of calling it 
Romper Room," Zweig said "or 
Jungle Gym. What do you 

think?" 
With finals week ahead, a

Drake's current reserach has 
to do with international regimes 
- regulatory institutions set up 
by governments amongst them-
selves to establish the rules of 
competition. He is attempting to 

illustrate "how the information 
revolution has transformed the 
cut of underlying political pro-
cesses within which these regimes 
are negotiated and adapted to 
new technological and economic 
circumstances. " 

Drake stated, "Telecommuni-
cations used to be boring because 
it was heavily regulated, but a 
more competitive attitude be-
tween countries along with new 
technological developments ha ve 
undermined the traditional 
cohesion." 

"Currently there is a lot of 
strategic reshuffling going on 
among governments to determine 
what their positions will be in 
international negotiations and 
how they will promote their own 
industries within that context . . . 
In the next decade we're going to 
lay the groundwork for the next 
20, 30, [or] 40 years because of 
the evolution that is taking place 
in the world economy. and sub-
sequently, as a result of the 
arrangements that will be arrived

depressive illness, schizophrenia 
and other disabling mental dis-

Department of psychiatry sci-
entists and physicians based at 
the UCSD School of Medicine 
and Medical Center, and at the 
Veterans Administration Medi-
cal Center are defining the chem-
ical and structural basis of men-
tal illness, utilizing advanced 
technology and molecular bio-
logical techniques to gain new 
insight into the normal and 
abnormal function of the brain. 

"The explosion of information 
from the basic and clinical scien-
ces about the brain has impor-
tant relevance to our under-
standing and treatment of mental 
disorders," Judd said. "Already, 
scientific discoveries during the 
past two decades have signifi-
cantly changed our concepts and 
approaches to depression, anx-
iety disorders and schizophrenia, 
and this is just the beginning." 

Judd's research has concen-
trated 'on psychopharmacology, 
or the effect of drugs on brain 
function. He has also helped 
develop new computer graphics 
techniques for mapping the elec-
trical activity of the brain, so 
that results of tests can be more 
quickly and more accurately 
interpreted. 

Judd earned his B.S. in psy-
chology from the University of 
Utah and his M.D. (cum laude) 
from UCLA, where he also 
completed his residency training 
in psychiatry and child psychia-
try. He served as a captain in the 
United States Air Force Medical 
Corps for two years, returning to 
UCLA in 1962. 

. During his tenure at UCSO, 
he has served as director of the 
clinical and educational pro-
grams of the department, chief 
of the psychiatry service at the 
Veterans Administration Medi-
cal Center, and president of the 
Medical Staff at the UCSD

Speed addicts: UCSD's bicycle team 
The air is tense and full of 

anticipation while the racers 
nervously move about, almost in 
,a frenzy. Registration is closed, 
and the last bikes are being 
inspected. The hectic atmosphere 
with last minute adjustments and 
stretching is intensified by an 
unusual silence. The quiet lin-
gers, as the only interruption 
comes from the voice ofthe head 
official as he goes over the rules 
for the upcoming race. The rac-
ers wait, full of expectations, 
ready to claim their strategic 
spot on the start line. The UCSD 
cycling team is represented in 
full force. 

The appearance of the team, 
with their lean torsos, smooth 
muscular legs , and gentle poise is 
deceiving, for the energy level 
and endurance hidden inside 
these individuals is accompanied 
by an overwhelming competitive 
nature. Putting in 300 to 400 
miles a week only whets their 
appetite for competition; endor-
phine junkies perhaps, pushing 
themselves to the limit every 
workout. The physical challenge 
of staying in top shape to race is 
an addiction, acting as a tem-
porary release from all scholastic 

pressures. 
The UCSD cycling team 

members share these feelings, 
while also sharinl a strong 
camaraderie amongst themselves; 
experiencing the speed and free-
dom of cycling, the desire to bet-
ter themselves, and the love of 
food . Yes, food ; again looking 
at these cyclists you wouldn't 
believe they could eat .5 ,000 calo-
ries a day or 32 jelly donut units, 
but don't let them fool you. If it's 
"eat to train" o,r "train to eat," 
the whole team enjoys this activ-
ity which helps counteract cyc-
ling atrophy. When putting in up 
to 300 miles or more a week they 
must be prepared to burn as 
much as .5,000 calories a day to 
avoid the point of physical fa-
tigue. 

Friendship and respect 
amongst each other becomes 
obvious by talking to some of the 
team members. Jeff Winkler's 
name is always followed by the 
designation of a true natural, 
entering the team his first year 
with a season of experience. He 
worked himself up to be one of 
the teams top riders. He is not 
the only one to develop; newco-
mers Mark Wineman and Andy 

Nevitt also have ability. Also, 
the entire women's team. with 
returning veterans Shannon 
Delaney, Cindy Brown, Lisa 
Eckardt, Laura Newbergh, and 
Jennifer Poodry, and the addi-
tion of promising newcomers 
Sheri Coble, Cristie Wellington 
and Jennifer McNammara 
should make UCSD a top con-
tender. 

The men show promise; they 
only lost one of their top four 
riders, keeping Nevitt, Winkler 
and Wineman, and adding Pete 
Fish, Gordon Ong, Chris Waage 
and Tuyen Nguyen from the B 
team. The A team should do very 
well again . The B team should do 
much better this year with re-
turning veteran Todd Preece and 
top C racers from last year, Mike 
Robertson, John Uebel, Dave 
Warren, Jeff Durbin and Eric 
Alicapala. Together with the help. 
of team veterans, new hopefuls 
like Raoul, Marcus Weber, Eric 
Fouts, Lary Fiorentino and Jeff 
Kile should make a well rounded 
and strong force to contend with. 

With the returning men and a 
promising women's team, the 
team anticipates a great season, 
especially after last year's fourth 

place finish in the western region 
and the mens' fint place win at 
the championships. 

This year's schedule looks very 
promising with many races on 
the way, includini the UCSD-
sponsored race scheduled for 
some time in April. The team 
will be trying to raise money 
through sponsorships and dona-
tions, including one from the 
UCSD bike shop. The rest of 
April is full with races scheduled 
to be hosted by Cal Poly, UCLA, 
UC Santa Cruz, and Stanford. 
Then the season will wind down 
to an end with the WCC Cham-
pionships held in Santa Barbara 
May 7 and 8. 

Organization is essential in 
planning the year's training 
schedule; base miles, power 
training, and speed work must 
be adjusted for each rider. Expe-
rienced riders and riders who 
belong to other clubs may want 
to adjust their schedules so they 
are peaking later in the year, and 
the new riders may want to focus 
on hitting their best as the season 
progresses. Everyone needs to 
analyze their own goals and their 
riding levels so he can train with 
those with common goals and

ability. They must also develop 
the skills of the entry level riders 
who need more time and practice 
to feel comfortable in riding with 
the pack. 

TCJlmwork and team effort are 
very Important in collegiate rac-
ing, as team tactics are a promi-
nent aspect of the sport. These 
team tactics add a different pers-
pective to the inter-collegiate race 
compared to the individualistic 
attitude of the USCf (United 
States Cycling federation) races. 
This team perspective tends to 
develop strong relationships 
between team members and 
teaches riders a new aspect ofthe 
race. Competition at this level is 
well-defined, so being able to 
work together as a team becomes 
the strategy to benefit not just 
one individual rider, but the team 
as a whole. This is not the only 
advantage of learning team tac-
tics; a rider also learns new posi-
tions other than in the front of 
the pack, and in doing so learns 
how the other riders think, thus 
giving him an edge. 

The strategy and mental 
awareness in cycling are as im-
portant as your physical strength.

Bicycling 
Continued from pale 11 
Being able to outguess or out-
smart the riders around you keeps 
you ahead, as well as prevents 
accidents. Learning how to ride 
as a team is a benefit for any 
cyclist. It induces a team spirit, 
alerts a wider mental scope of the 
sport, and helps your team score 
the points necessary to win. 

If you stop by the UCSD Bike 
Shop anyday, you will find at 
least one team member repairing 
or fine tuning his or her bike, 
checking the latest schedule, or 
just socializing with other 

teammates. 
To many, it is tough to be a 

team rider all the time. A good 
teammate may have to sacrifice 
himself so that another rider 
might win. After the race, coaches 
and teammates alike are very 
grateful and praise is plentiful, 
but by the end ofthe season, only 
the final results remain . It is ded-
ication, team training and good 
camaraderie that keeps one rider 
from getting selfish, regardless 
of the team's position. 

The leaders believe their team 
is strong this y~ar with 40 men 
and 1.5 women. They started in 
October, offering positions on 
the team to anyone who "pos-
sessed the desire to train hard , 

. owned a bike, and had a good 
attitude." Teaching the leaders 
have transformed the riders into 
a properly trained group who is 
anxious for the competition. 

The Olympic Training Center 
ranks cycling second only to 
boxing for the amount of train-
ing time put in for a race. The 
first phase of the training pro-
gram concentrates on acquaint-
ing the inexperienced riders to 
the general teChniques of pack 
riding, effective gear use, and 
most importantly, road safety. 
The team riders must spend a 
great deal of time developing the 
concentration and confidence 
which cycling requires. 

In this first phase of training, 

Del Mar Discs 
----ratch Your CD Itch 

We're the first and last word in compact discs, with over 
5,000 titles, specializing i.n rock, jazz and new age. We 
buy and sell used discs, feature weekend specials and 

special order any disc we didn't carry at no extra charge. 
And we welcome UCSD students with this offer. $1 Off per 

disc when you buy 2 or more disc. and show thl. coupon. 

these basic skills are worked into 
low-mile, low intensity rides of 
20 or 2.5 miles, four to five times 
a week, plus a weekend ride. 
These rides arc used to teach 
necessary survival skills while.4j,t 
the same time they develop the 
team 's physical fitness and 
strength . Along with the road 
miles, the riders also have weight 
tTaining and foot workouts , 
which consist of running stairs to 
build their aerobic capabilities . 

After January the concentra-
tion of training focuses on the 
riding strategy. Speed work beg-
ins and mileage increases to 
somewhere around 3.50 miles a 
week. 

The third and final stage of 

Thursday. December J . 1987 13 

SPORTS 
training involves intense speed 
work, which consists of interval 
training and motor pacing. Work 
on hill-climbing, (acceleration), 
and pace lines is continued 
throughout this stage. Endurance 
is a must; keeping the fitness 
level up through the race season 
requires consistent training. 

The pack's human element 
comes through - it is the train-
ing of each individual that will 
make it to the finish, not the 
bike. With each finish comes a 
release, a strong sense of ac-
complishment. Thrills, speed, 
control , and finally accom-
plishment - this is what the ~ 
UCSD Cycling team is all 
ab~L ~

This crew of tube ·polo veterans held all the cards In 

Iheir hand Ihis quarter. They have been knocking on 
the door for several seasons, but always fell to either 
Ihe ABID's 0' Inllghtlng. ThiS quarter co-captains 
Enr ight and Mangold set up a grueling traIning regi-
men thai allowed them 10 fine tune thei, squad. No 
one could ever knock the talent that Divothead put In 
the pool. but the commlnment was alwavs a question. 
Not thIS quaner. They played like they were on a mis-
SIon. Enright and Mangold we,e loaded witll aces and 
just had to wa~ and lay out their carda. 

The final hand was the chamPIonshIp game against 
Squelch Skazam. Unfortunately for Squelch caplain 
Dave Pregerson the deck was stacked against them. 
From the opening whistle it was clear thlt DivotAead 
wanted to take home the whole pot. Squetch had a 
very successful spring campaign when Ihey won the 
AA tiUe. They lound out. though, that Ide IS a IInle d~­
ferenl in the Major Leagues. Divothead shut down 
SquelCh's high scorirog forward Suzy Kramer with a 
smothering delense. Pregerson's squad could neve, 
get anything gOing and on the other end could not 
slow down the pOlent altack of Mangold, Laura 
Knockenhauer. KIp Fulbeck and Max Stlnchcombe. In 
goat lor Dlvotead, JOhn "Swiss Cheese" Sklul shut

As usual this diVISIon was a ,ealloss up. The 
Freaky executives and Slippery When Wet survived a

concerned that hiS squad mrght be a 1II11e nervous 
before the game. but it WIS Bi. Kuypet's Slippery

by the Executives. Kuyper searched for a combination 
of players to break out of the stump, but ittoote until

If you had been reading the

nize this Team of the Week. The

highly publicized due to the fact 
that they have not yet lost and 
that they insist on running up 
the score in all of their Coed M 
football games. 

In the semifinals of the league, the Rose-Nlolics suffrred t\NO firsts. 
They had to punt early on and they also had their first touchdown scored 
against them. THROUGH THE HOLE was tough, but they couldn't stand 
up to the power, ~ if they did ~ a guy c~ring the girl receivers

The finals are coming soon and so is their toughest opponent. Good 
Luck and don't be nervous, just remember t~ curse of the BudMan.

Reflecting on

by michael martinez

An oft-repeated summary 
of John Huston's career main-
tains that his films showed no 
distinctive trademark or style; 
that if anything characterized 
his body of work, it was its 
sheer diversity. Sixty years of 
distinguished filmmaking 
produced many classics 
("Treasure of Sierra Madre, It 
"The Maltese Falcon"); criti-

cal and cult favorites ("Red 
Badge of Courage, It "Beat the 
Devil," "Fat City"); interest-
ing failures ("Moby Dick," 
"The Misfits"); and even a big 
budget disaster ("Annie"). 

Looking closely though. you 
do see a recurring device -the 
celebration of vivid characters 
and ,,"Ievation of detail over 
plot. Huston has always gravi-
tated towards stories of alle-
gorical dimension, rich

. with possibility for visual 
detail and flawed "everyman" 
characters. 

Huston's brilliant career 
concludes on a small scale 
with a period piece, an affec-
tionate telling of James Joyce's 
short story, "The Dead," 
which opens in local theaters 
on Dec. 18. The movie is a 
labor of love on many levels 
for Huston. As a naturalized 
citizen of Ireland and a great 
admirer of Joyce's "Ulysses," 
Huston may have been influ-
enced by Joyce in subtle ways 
throughout his long career. 

Joyce's writing is the liter-
ary equivalent of Huston's 
filmmaking with its cumula-
tive effect of detail and charac-
terization to present both 
tangible and symbolic ideas. 

Huston's screenplay faith-
fully translates Joyce's expres-
sive prose into filmic terms. 
The final product is quaint 
and rather talky, perhaps re-
quiring too much reflection 
for contemporary audiences. 

"The Dead" is set in 1904, 
during a post-Christmas party 
in the townhouse inhabited by 
three of Dublin's finest ladies. 
Huston, like Joyce, offers a 
lively mix of Irish imagery, 
characters and dialogue. The 
main part of the story takes 
place replete with music, 
dancing, storytelling and a lav-

ish Irish dinner. The songs 
and conversation continually 
evoke memories of the past 
-of brave war heroes, celebrated 
opera Singers, past loves and 
the good old days. 

The underlying theme is the 
continuing influence of the 
dead on the liVing, and how 

pointless it is to cling to the 
past (and the dead) at the 
expense of the present. 

The gallery of delightful 
(and hammy) supporting 
players shines, but the empha-
sis of the movie is on Gabriel 
(Donal McCann), a relative of

This opening is unique because 
of the artists as well as the

these include: an architecture, 

still~life and landscape. Stu~ 
dents painted their interpreta~ 
tions of apples, onions, egg~ 
plants, a tree or a building, as 
realistically as possible. 

Because of the unique nature 
of the show, it is possible to 
compare the subtle variations 
between each artist's style and 
the technique employed in 

their work. By not deviating in 
style within their particular 
works, the viewer can identify 
the artists 'other pieces located 
throughout the gallery with~

Yourgrau will read from his 
new book of short stories en-
titled, "Wearing Dad's Head." 
The stories portray an inten-
sely personal world where a 
father and a son go on a safari 
in the suburbs; a mother has 
fun being struck by lightening; 
a cow gets dolled up in lin-
gerie; and a dead parent comes . 
visiting in a soap bubble. 

narratives are rendered in a 
vivid, carefully structured 
visual language. 

"Wearing Dad's Head" is 
Yourgrau's third published 
book of short stories. His pre-
vious works, "A Man Jumps 
Out of An Airplane," and 
"lbe Sadness of Sex," have 
been described as "a wealth of 
imagination .. . [which] are 
difficult to categorize and not 
always easily analyzed or inter-
preted . " 
• "Wearing Dad's Head" is 

available at the La Jolla 
Museum of Contemporary 
Art's bookstore for $7.95. 

T he book cover of " W ear-
ing Dad 's Head " asks the 
reader to, " imagine all these 
prodigies rendered in inten-
sely visual language in fi rst-
hand narratives as urgent and 
compressed as news reports , 
and as r ichly innocent as 
fables." The jacket further 
states , " Yourgrau 's brill iant ,

Combat cowboys

these boys are for real. 

McCoy'S moaning (often un-
intelligible) lyr ics and Peter 
Yates' and Paul Wright 's 
whip-cracking guitars, a 
strange sense of hope per~ades 
this rather foreboding view of 
the future . 

"Spaghetti-metal?" Strange , 
but true . The Fields of the 
Nephilim, a five-piece band 
from England, have combined 
the imagery from Sergio 
Leone's classic Clint Eastwood 
Western trilogy and the swirl-
ing sonic wall of doom-laden 
heavy metal to produce a 
sound so ominous and black 
that you have to wonder if 

Apparently they are. The 
Nephilim seem quite obsessed 
with evil and its inevitable tri-
umph over good . One look at 
the exquisite Satan-like cover 
photography prepares you for 
what lies inside: 10 howling 
tunes of post-nuclear holo-
caust destruction, death and 
general despair. 

With the aid of bassist Tony 
Pettit and drummer Nod 
Wright, the aforementioned 
successfully perform each 
creepy song with a propulsive 
and hypnotic mix of droning 
rhythms, wailing harmonicas 
and bloody chainsaws that 
send you screaming through 
desert dust storms for more.

Don't get the wrong idea, 

"Dawnrazor" is not a depres-
sing album . Despite Carl Sure all the Satanic hoopla is silly, but the Nephilim do it 

so well . Unlike the hokey

abound on MTV, the Nephi-

Eric Clapton, Etta James,

Lions and tigers 
by eleanor castillo 

luardian intern 

What animal is character-
ized by three shades of blue, 
with streaks of green and 
orange, and covered by blue 
and purple polka dots? No, it 
is not a perversion of mother 
nautre, but the "Big Goose. It 
This colorful wood sculpture 
is one of 45 pieces in the col-
lection entitled "Carnival of 
Animals" on display at the 
International Gallery down-
town. 

This holiday exhibition fea-
tures the fine craftsmanship of 
folk sculptor Robert Tolone. 
Each animal , created from 
Malaysian jelutong wood , 
ranges in size from three-inch 
ornaments to 45-foot life-sized 
salmons. Unlike most sculp-
tors, Tolone 's tool is a chain-
saw, used 80 percent to 90 
percent in the crea tion pro-

cess of each figure. These one-
of-a-kind animals rely on paint 
for their individuality, as there 
is no casting or carving done 
for detail. The completion of 
the collection took approxi-
mately one-half year. 

Upon stepping into the 
gallery, one is ultimately cap-
tured by Tolone's wonderful 
feel for color. Although his 
painting "is totally unrelated 
to the object," in actuality it is 
a "series of relationships" 
based upon the fundamentals 
ot color placement. His choice 
of colors rests on what is 
around it. But the sculptor'S 
true reasoning lies behind his 
belief in giving each animal 
some variety . 

Tolone's animals ironically 
have "no hidden meaning" to 
be interpreted. His works are 
"there to look at," as his justi-
fication for their creation was 
simply to "have a good time. " 

A carved and painted wooden sculpture from the "Carnival of Animals" is 
on exhibit at the International Gal/ery.

You remember. She was 
always there when you were 
frightened. And if you gO( hun, 
she was standing by with ban-
dages. Wouldn't it feel good 
to talk to your mother again 
right now? 

Calling over AT&T Long 
Distance Service probably 
COStS less than you think, too. 
And if you have any questions 
about AT&T rates or service, 
a customer service repre-
sentative is always standing 
by to talk to you. Just call

Sure, your schoolwork and 
your friends keep you busy. 
But call home and find out 
what she's wrapped up in .

Holy ordeal 
"Art is long, life is short," is 

the message of the "Madman 
and the Nun, It a play which 
explores the boundaries of 
sanity, to be staged by UCSO's 
department of theatre. 

The play will be performed 
at 8 pm Thursday through 
Saturday, Dec. 3-5, and at 7 
pm Sunday, Dec. 6, at the 
Mandell Weiss Center for the 
Performing Arts. The audience 
will be seated onstage. 

A short play in three acts 
and four scenes, which the 

author dedicated "to all the 
madmen of the world," this 
absurd theatre work by Polish 
playwright Stanislaw 19nacy 
Witkiewicz, has a cast of eight 
actors. 

Production dramaturge 
Caridad Svich says that Wit-
kiewicz is said to be the father 
of performance art. "Along 
with being a painter, novelist, 
dramatist and philosopher, 
Witkiewicz created his own 
theatre of the absurd 25 years 
before Samuel Beckett and 

Eugene lonesco brought it to 
the popular level. 

Two schools of psychiatric 
thought clash in this romance 
'between a nun and an asy-
lum's resident poet, the 
famous Alexander Walpurg. 

"The Madman and the 
Nun" is directed by Patricia 
Pretzinger. Scenic design is by 
J. Michael Griggs, costumes 
are by Catherine Meacham, 
lighting is by Alexandra Pon-
tone, and sound design is by 
Steve Erb. Stage manager is 
Cari Norton. The play was 
translated into English .by 
Daniel C. Gerould.

Huston 
Continued from pale 3 
the three ladies, and his wife 
Gretta (Anjelica Huston). It is 
Gretta's touching remem-
brance of a past love that pro-
vides the film's centerpiece. 

Along with Gabriel at their 
hotel, she is all but oblivious 
to him as she recounts how a 
song sung at the party rekin-
dled emotions felt 20 years 
earlier - emotions of love for 
a doomed young man who, 
she maintains, "died (or me. It 
As she tearfully dozes off, 
Gabriel realizes that he doesn't 

really know Gretta and has 
never stirred her emotions so 
strongly. Up to then a rather 
detatched protagonist, he 
concludes the story with a 
reflective and deeply symbolic 
passage evoking snowy plains, 
lonely graveyards and future 
passings. 

This is also a fitting fade-
out on Huston's career. It -
remains to be seen if his spirit 
and influence will sweep over 
the next generation. Today's 
filmgoers are largely seeing the 
results of marketing and de-
mographic studies - not the 
vision of artists. We may never 
see his like again.
