The original letter attempted

those ideas were dealt with in

several 11l1portanl aspects t hat 
were not deemed su itable fo r

alluded to in the a rticle that 
the U niver it y Center wou Id 
be built withou t studen t 
approval (by the way, t he 
Univer ity Center is an idea , 
not a building). This of course 
is poss ible, bu t highl y

Student Cente r would have to 
be approved through referen-
dum before co n st ru c t io n 
would begin . 

Dr. Watson was quoted as 
saying something to the effec t 
that t h e pla n wo uld be 
approved and he did n' t ca re 
how the vot ing came out.

unethical journa lism in a May

Chancellor Joe Watson and t he

her disagreement wi th the 
article itself which is fine, but 
then proceeded to go overboard 
by making grossly inaccurate 
claims. Allow me to clear up 
some of the mess. 

First of all, she claimed that 
the information she gave me 
(through a phone conversa-
tion) from "The History of 
T hird College" which was 
written in the early 70's by 
Thi rd Col lege students IS

chapter 2 - The KDST

saying "He Que Watson) set up

1 don't completely agree with . 
Dr. Wat son may have agreed 
with many of the things they 
recommended, but he wasl1 't 
exact ly pl eased with them all. 
The recommendation of 
primary importance is that the 
Student Center Board deal 
directly with the Vice 
Chancellor, Dr. Wat son, 1 
think, would have preferred 
they go through the assis tant 
VC. As it stands now, theSCB 
has equal standing as the 
IXJlicy board withtheassi",tant 
VC as general manager. In this ' 
way, the SCB can maintain a 
strong voice and sen'e as a 
check and balance in the

And where were these

NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT. The San Diego fans at the 
Padre· Pirate game Monday night are not to be belie\'ed for their 
harsh and unfair treatment of Padre reliever Garv Lucas. Sure. 
Lu cas did lose two consecutive games. but is that any reason to 
boo hi m profusely when he entered the contest in the] 3th inning 
with runners at first and second and Jason Thompson at the 
plate? So what happens? Thompson rips a two-run double up the 
alley and Lucas is booed even louder. No one ever said being a 
major league ballplayer was all fame and glitter. 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT. How can Arkansas's Garv 
Anderson s ign with the l SFL Tampa Bay Bandits Monday 
afternoon after never receiving an offer from the San Diego 
Chargers, the team that drafted him in the first round? 
Apparently, Anderson feels his future is as a running back, not a 
wide receiver, th e position he was designated to play for Don 
Coryell. But is that any reason to sign with the Bandits without 
even listening to owner Gene Klei n 's offer?

TEAM OF THE WEEK 
SPONSORED BY TIfE MILLER BR -WING COMPANY 



10 The UCSD Guardian Thursday. May 12. 1983 

FOR ALL YOU DO ... THIS 
BUD PAGE IS FOR YOU! 

1M DYNASTIES or WHEN WILL IT EVER END ••• 
After writing last week's bud page ~out 

softball Igot to thinking about our hallowed 
1M history, The word dynasty was on my 
mind, How many dynasties have we had and 
how long have they lasted, The inspiration 
for all this came about when I was writ ing 
about Tim Pickwell 's Dynasty squads. It also 
came to me that maybe there really are no 
dynasties after going over the weekend's 
results. Pickwell's Dynasty men 's team 
turned out to be one of the shortest lived 
dynasties in the history of UCSO efter losing 
6-5 in their fourth game of the young 
season. But it got me thinking i!bout some 1M 
teams who may not be dynasties, but are a 
tradition at UCSO. 

The first squad that comes to mind is the 
Boffos. This is appropriate as they all hail 
from our original campus, Scripps. Needless 
to say this squad's tradition dates all other 
teams, It's said the first 1M game wes played 
in 1964, the first year this campus was open, 
But Dan Hanes and gang say the Boffos have 
been playing IMs since Ellen SCriPPS threw 
the first ball out in 1910. We aren't sure what 
their team name means but could take a 
guess. They have won numerous 1M t itles in 
softball, mainly in the summer, It's easier for 
those old muscles to limber up 

The next squad to come to mind also 
comes from down under at SIO. They are

the Sliding Drabos. They haven't won many 
softball championships but boy they sure 
know how to produce children . 40 at last 
count. They started in 1971 and have been 
together ever since. They originally thought 
up their team name after a Padre hat night. 
They decided they might as well use a name 
that matched the SD on their hats; thus the 
birth of the Sliding Drabos. Orabo, for you 
Webster readers, means Yellowish brown 
color. Now with uniforms to match their 
hats and name they are one of the best 
dressed teams in IMs. 

Biology has sent out an unusually high 
amount of dynasties. We're told that a 
prospective grad student's transcript must 
include arm strength and home·to-first time 
in order to be accepted into the masters 
program. The Biohazerds are the pride and 
joy of the department. Many trophies have 
been placed in the department trophy case 
by this squad. It's common knowledge that 
when one grad student with tremendous 
talent is about to earn his masters in biology 
the department will offer tree admission 
into the doctorate program for another six 
year contract. You can verify thiS with Or. 
McKeown. Their first game was played In 
1975, 

Uilies of the Field IS another biology 
tradition. But they are not recognized 

COf!d AA 
1 Stro1<e It Up the M,ddle 
'2 Dynasty 
3 Psuedo Drabos 

officially by the biOlogy heads because of 
their silly name, their silly Hawaiian shirts and 
the total lack of a w inning attitude. Too 
much fun IS had by all. ThiS squad was the 
first to barbeque at ball games. A tradit ion 
the Lillies are proud of. They played their 
first game in 1974. 

A unique tradition In 1M history IS the all 
women squad Brown Sugar. These ladies 
have been together since 1978. They have 
won numerous titles in all 1M sports and 
have helped create and strengthen the 
women's program. Most of them are 
students at Third college who are making 
sure the Sugar tradition continues. 

There are some budding traditions on the 
horizon but they are just pups compared to 
the previously mentioned squads. Rupe's 
Troops·1980, Batterers·1979, Sit On My 
Base·1980, Swamp·1980, Dung·1981, 
Ungusman·1979, Plain Wrap-1981 are a few 
budding dynasties. It usually takes 4 to 6 
years to graduate depending on money, 
drinking habits, grades, and amibition to get 
the heck out. We will see in a few years if 
these budding dynasties will become 
fulnedged dynasties by staying the required 
seven years or get their priorities mixed up 
and move on to the dull drums of earning a 
living. Only time Will tell.

1M TRACK and FIELD GAMES 
Dan leile Elie and Catherine 

Naughton, two happy-go-lucky 
members of thiS year's womens varsity 
soccer team, have a couple of things In 
common Both are foreign students, 
Elie trom Ecuador and Naughton from 
France, and both have a passionate 
love for the sport of track and field. 

Danlelie and Catherine played out 
their love affair With track to the hilt last 
Friday afternoon In the annual UCSD 
Intramural Track and field Games In a 
meet that for the first time produced 
no records In the men's events, Elie and 
Naughton combined forces to 
completely rewrite the women 's 
record liSt. 

Elle, for one, ran herself completely 
Into the ground She won both of the 
spnnts, the 100 meters (In 1293) and 
the 200 (In 27 12) and entered the 
1 Oo-meter hurdles completely on a lark 
and won that too In 1620. At the end 
of the day she anchored her women's 
400 meter relay team, Los Chlngones,

to a 57.11 clocking and then to top It all 
off she ran a 67·second leg on the 
Distance Medley quartet (of Ferradez, 
Aukerman and Nelson) to a near 
record 12,26.4 mark. Oh yeah ... ln 
between all of thiS she also managed to 
fin ish second In the high Jump 
competition With a leap of 4'1 1· At the 
end the pretty 23·year·old blonde was 
practically speechless and gasping for 
anything that she could breathe. " That 
was fun," she said, " but I'm gOing to die 
any minute now Could you please bury 
me at the finish line'" 

Naughton was nearly as busy dunng 
her three· hour stint on the track, She 
finished third to Danlelle In the 100 In 
1360, won both of the Jumps ... the long 
Jump at 16 '5· and the high Jump With a 
personal best of 5'1 \2" and helped Los 
Chlngones In the relay With a strong 
100 meter leg 

In a meet that could eaSily have been 
forgotten, thiS one Will always be 
remembered Danlelle and Catherine 
saw to that

Imaginative look at 
the future at t:xpo '83 
Robots, autos and spacecraft in LA 

By GRI:GORY CHAP[llL 
Over the past weekend . a rare 

opportunity to glimpse into the 
twenty first century was given at 
the Los Angeles Convention 
Cenler in lhe form of 
"Futurcworld Expo '83. " This 
exhibition afforded th e rare 
chance to see innovations in 
such varied fields as Music. 
Hea lth . Robotics, Space travel , 
and Transportation. 

balancing checkbooks and 
computer graphic programs 
that would be the delight of any 
stoner. captivated many of the 
participants ' attention. 

Synthesized and computer-
ized music concerts were given 
throughout the four days of the 
exh ibit by Constance Demby 
and Ivor Darreg who also 
displayed unique stringed 
instruments and demonstrated 
the increasingly growing world 
of sonic music. The Fairlight 
synthesizers used in the 
concerts and on display were a 
knob twiddler 's delight with 
built in graphic equalizers and 
more blinking buttons, dials, 
and meters than a true 
afficiando could possibly use. 

Two of the most advanced 
passenger cars, the Vector W2 
Twin Turbo and Ford 's 
experimental Probe IV tar lVere 
also featured along with a 
preview of the Los Angeles 
Metro Rai I project. The Vector 
W2 nickna med " the space 
sh uttle of the street" has a 600+ 
horsepower twin turbo charged, 
fuel injec ted aluminum Can-Am 
VB engine, modified f - 16 seats, 
and can go from 0 - 60 in 3.5. 

~econd~. Everyone IIIho looked 
a t and inspected thi s car 
seemed to be contemplating 
how to own this mere $150,000 
machine.

robots and tJte ultimate household servant. Dr. Carl Sagan and a full size Viking l.ander spacecraft. 

Entertainment was by far one 
of the minor emphasis of the 
exhibit that also featured new 
innovation in computer 
software for the businessman 
and layman alike. Included were

eye, Silent Rage. force of 
Vengeance, and now. Lone Wolf. 
These films have done 
tremendously well. and have 
grossed over. 200 million 
dollars. 

Lone Wolf is Norris 's most 
recent and best film to date. 
Though the film contains a lot of 
violence, Norris does not 
consider it a part icularly violent 
film. 

" My movie is done in a very 
pro-social area," said Norris, 
"where it is the good guy versus 
the bad guy. more or less like 
old John Wayne movies from the 
1950·s. 

Like many of his past films.

The Los Angeles Metro Rail

to be implemented over the 
next ten years and wi II be one of 
the most advanced transpor-
tation systems in operation in 
any city by being designed to 
not only transport passengers in 
comfort ~ ut also by being 
extremely economical in its 
energy use. 

Designs for the home of the 
future were also exhibited in the 
form of "The Green Machine: a 
fully self sufficient home, 
capable of generating its own 
energy and hot water while at 
the same time being relati vely 
mobile. 

The interior of the home of 
the future was much different 
than today's with the advent of 
freeform furniture and robotic 
servants. Amon~ the home

'Lone Wolf' Norris on Hollywood 
Lone Wolf received an R rating 
from the Motion Picture 
Audience Association (MPAA). 
At first this did not present a 
problem for Norris, because he 
has built up a substantial 
audience . However Norris 
revealed that a New York critic 
pointed out, " Most kids in major 
cities will be able to see it. New 
York. Chicago, Detroit. and Lo 
Angeles. but you qet into the 
bible belt areas like Texas and 
Virginia , areas where they ar 
real ~tric.t, they won't be able to 
see it. Kids cannot get into see 
your movie. becau an R in 

those areas is like an X. " 
Norris decided that he would 

change the minds of the MPAA 
and with this goal he new to 
New York. 

"It was a lot of work." said 
Norris, "so I thought that it 
wasn·t really worth it. but I 
decided with Lone Wolf that ( 
had enough of their biason what 
an R is and what PG is. " 

Norris sat down with the 
members of MPAA to talk with 
them about the mm, and had a 
pecial screening of the film for 

them. 
"The bigge'>t problellllVas the

name Chuck Norris." said 
Norris. " It represents what many 
people think of as wall-to-wall 
fighting with blood and guts, 
and throats ripped out." 

After prolonged negotiations. 
Norri convinced MPAA that the 
film did not deserve an R rating. 
so Lone Wolf wa~ given a PG 
rating. 

Although Norris co-produced 
Lone IVolr. he has no desire to 
direct his own films. 

" When you are a director you 
are a captain of a ship. said 

Norri~, "and you not only hale 
to direct yourself. but you hale 

truly impress i\ e. 
So many exhibits at the Expo 

\\ere ~ enchanting. enlight-
ening. an imaginative that a 

compres~d air night pack that 
was nown around the parking 
lot seems tri~ial next to it all. It 
was a shame though, that the 
$i .50 admission thwarted so 
many from seeing what they'll 
now have to wait for but if they 
are lucky the Expo will come 
again . 

to direct all the other people 
around YOll the production 
people and other~ . it's a big 
job." 

Norri considers himself a 
riSing star in Hollywood. but he 
does not participate in the 
Hollywood party and drug 
scene. 

'1 don 't get into that make-
belie\ e land or facade that 
people think movies are all 
about. " explained Norris. To 
me d movie star or actor is just 
like any other job. 

At pre enl. Norris is plann ing 
yet another film \o,:hich should 
begin production in July. The 
plot of the film conccrn~ the

extremely personal experiences 
for the audience members as 
they are engaged in a highly 
visceral response to McCarthy's 
intense subject matter. In his 
performances. McCarthy 
scrutinizes the physical and 
psychological aspects of his self 
through transformations of his 
behavior involving masks. dolls. 
and primitive rituals. such as 
smearing his body with 
common substances like 
catsup. mayonnaise. and soap. It 
is through these personal rituals 
that he is able to create 
situations that are both 
fascinatinq and abhorrent. 

Paul Mccarthy has his MFA 
from the University of Southern 
california in Film . Video. and Art 
History. He has been the 
recipient of two individual artist 
grants from the National 
Endowment for the Arts .

. Kockats riding the rockabilly wave 
By JOHN NH 

Oln the pa~t year. ROlkabilly 
ha~ come to be defined to the 
American public as a revival of a 
hardlore !>tyle that exbted 
during the 1950's. As with any 
dt:riva tive style of music there 
are alway~ two paths that can be 
foIlO<\ied. Either a pure form of 
the style can be dneloped or 
the original style can be 
redefi ned to include other 
aspec~ of entirely different 
genres. 

Since late 1977 ( the height of 
the punk movement ) the 
Rockats have gained somewhat 
of a cult following among the 
hardcore Rockabilly fans in Los 
Angeles. London and New York. 
Up unti I very recently. the 
Rockats have had to compete 
with the dying New York punk 
movement as well as the various 
trends away from the idea of 
rock and roll. What has set the 
Rockats apart from the original 
Rockabilly sound is that they 
have sought to integrate a 
newer ound into their music 
without losing the basic 
elements of Rockabilly. 

Now based in New York . the 
Rockats originally hailed from 
England. In 1977 the Rockats 
left England under the advice of 
their managers. in hopes of 
gaining exposu re. As Rockat 
Preston Dibs recalls. "We were 

playing a very hMdcore 
Rockabilly \\hen In' fir..,t startrd 
out. \\ihidl was during the great 
punk explo!>ion in england and 
only the Teddy boys \Hluld 
listen to us, EI en the Tt~dd}' Boy~ 
didn t liI\e u'> all that llIuch 
bec.ause \\e I\ercnt playing 
Rockabilly the way they like it 

Hoping to find better lucl,. 
the Rockats moved to New York 

reCl'ntiy. 011 the othCI hanel , 
t:lIgland b such a small plact: 
and has so many trends \Ihith 
are heali!y inflUl'ntcd by the 
press. Usually a band can 
become a top ~tJrrill~J gig in a 
mattcr of three wed\s and once 
a band becomes too 
Ameritaniled and loses famr 
l\iith the uitics they get panned 
out. 

''America is just getting into the new 
music as a whole. It's really taken about 
five years to take hold but that's because 

it's just so big." 
- Preston Dibs of the Rockats 

only to find thdt they were 
ba ically in the same situa tion. 
. New York was really heavily 
into the punk scene," Dibs 
continues. 'S id Vicious was 
there and everyone was just 
getting into it. " When asked if 
he saw this as a result of the 
musical lag that the US has as 
compared to Europe. Dibs 
answered, " America is just 
getting into the new music as a 
whole. It's really taken about 
five years to take hold but that·s 
because it's just so big. I think 
things have been really helped 

Despite th e fact that th e punk 
movement had adverse effects 
on the ea rly career of the 
Rockats. Dibs points out. "The 
whole punk movement was 
quite an influence to us. To be 
able to get up on stage and not 
be incredibly accomplished 
musicians impressed me quite a 
lot. It was the very basis of the 
punk thing that prompted us to 
get up and play onstage 
anyway. " 

Presently the Rockats have 
released a live album which 
broke Billboards top 200 and 

abo .111 t.J' produted by ~likl' 
rhorn of Soft Ccillame. " We hJd 
.lh\Jv~ wanted to add I,illd of ,I 
nl'l\ -edge 10 our mu~ic . lhat ~ 
why wc approac hed NiI~el horn, 
Soft Ccll " producer. Now we'\,c 
got kind of a blend of traditional 
Rochabilly and n('\\ m lIsit. YOll 
can 't really write mu~ic in thl 
eighties without exploring 
some new angle of sorts." 

On the present trends in 
music. Dibs cOlllments, 'One of 
the big things right now in New 
York is a punk revival. I guess 
they figure that they've missed 
out on ~omet hing that 
happened five years ago. They're 
getting into the real hardcore, 
slam dancing and everything." 

The Rockals have hopes for 
deve loping a strong foothold on 
the American public. Presently 
they are embarking on a 
national tour and will go into 
the studio oon to produce a full 
lP. Right now they seem headed 
towards success. Their single 
" Burning" is getting extensive 
airplay on some stations across 
the country. Commenting on 
the success of " Burning," Dibs 
said. "Yea, radio people picked 
up on that a lot. If it were left to 
th e band to decide. we would 
have had " Make Your Move" the 
single. I think that shows a lot 
more of what the band is really 
about."

When David Atherton 
c.onducted the San Diego 
Symphony last week Rimsky-
Korsakov's Scheherelilde it was 
also too quick. and complex and 
dramatic strains became. as 
they can so easily do, tonfused 
and mushy. However. this was 
only in the first movement. and 
the later ones. espelially the 
second. were c lear and powerfu I. 
Atherton has occasionally 
reveal ed a tendency to rush 
music. which is fine if he can: a) 
keep up the technical quality 
and, support th e stylistic 
quality. In this case the 
symphony was not able to 
accomplish even the first. 

The week before. on their 
long string of unsuccessful 
guest conductors, they played 
Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto. a 
continually popular piece and 
continually played . This is the 
third time they have done it in 
the last four or five years, and 
considering that it is a flashy 
piece without very much depth 
(new cha racter to discover with 
each new performance) it is 
becoming very tiresome to 
listen to. The soloist. Miriam 
Fried. is one of the best. and the 
ex perien ce resembled an 
episode from Brideshead 
Revisited: " I felt th e oxygen 
being pumped out of the 
atmosphere all round me: I felt 
myself expiring in a vacuum 
while all the while I could see 
through the bell -glass the loved 
executioner. And she went on 
with the murder in a gentle, 
leisurely way, quite uncon-
scious that she wa doing any 
harm." 

The best thing since Bernard 
Rands, however. happened three 
week ago when Gunther Herbig 
conducted Anton Bruckner', 
Symphony NO.8. The pi ece last~ 
for one an a halfhours. and there 
in no intermission in which to 
drink fortifying champagne. The 
experience could have been 
moribuno, or even fatal. but 
su rprisingly there was literally 
not a dull moment. With great 
crashes of force (which is quitc 
different than noise), and ill 
between ~uspen.'>e a~ drawn out 
as it cou ld be, Herbig made the 
entire concert shorter than a few 
minutes of th e Tchaikovsky. lie 
needed, he said afterwards. the 
quality of the mu~i{ ians of th e 
San Diego Symphony. but th ey. 
on the other hand , cannot 
function as beautifully <IS the y 
sometimes do without thc 
contro l of a conducter such as 
Herbig .

A masterful follow-up 
to 'The Wall' from floyd 

By KARL DAEGUNG 

-----------------

The final Cut 
Pink floyd 
Columbia 

Roger Waters, the master-
mind of the supergroup Pink 
noyd , apparently still has 
something left to say after the 
group's introspective master· 
piece entitled The Wall took 
audiences and fans through the 
life of a disturbed rock star in 
early 1980. The final Cut is the 
follow up to The Wall. and 
instead 01 an attempt to " top ' 
that album, it is instead a 
ha unting, reflective testament 
of post war attitude and 
introspection. The final Cut is a 
masterpiece in its own subtle 

way. Though it IS not produced 
on such a gradiose scale as The 
Wall, or a~ stark , as 1977's 
Animals It nevertheless 
succeeds on the dynamic 
properties of the mu~ic the 
bitter, reflectile lyrics and a 
magni ficent build up and release 
that explodes from the ~cond 
side. 

In The final Cut, Waters, 
backed by guitari~t David 
Gilmore drummer Nick ~tason 
and a host of others 
( Keyboard ist Rick Wright left 
the grou p after 17 years ) has 
l>Titten a self titled requiem for 
the post wardream ' that probes 
war, life. and life after war in 
todays world . Get Your Filth,

By CANOlL Blue Thunder? 6) PORKY'S 
In 1948 the brown timber of 

the UCSD eucalyptus forest. 
then Camp Mathews Marine 
Corps base, was in operational 
mode as a testing ground to 
combat the terror of the Nazi 
"Blitzkrieg": Ughtning warfare. 

The year is not '48 it will soon 
be '84, Instead of one man of 
terror, th ere now exists 
terrorists throughout the world . 
Where there was once warfa re of 
.Iightning. soon there will be

through the integrated helmet 
and display sight system. with a 
rea l-time thermal imagery of 
the terrain . permitting combat 
operation in total darkness, " 

The military officials who 
created Blue Thunder claim 
their intent is to establish a 
police action helicopter strike 
force in event of terrorists 
activities at the 1984 Olympic

A few good 
moments in 
the 'Valley' 

By SIMON[ 
Valley Girl is the first in a 

succession of summer films 
which begin to come off studio 
shelves as soon as the sun 
comes out. 

Starring Nicolas Cage, as a 
Hollywood new-waver, and 
Deborah Foreman, as a status-
crazed valley girl. the movie 
opens with five minutes of 
incomprehensible " valley talk " 
in which fi ve vals drool over 
'a w esom e, trip endi c ul ar 

dudes." The beginning is not a 
good indica tor of the whole film 

surpri singl y th e fi 1m 
redeems itse l f with a funny and 
appealing rendition of bad boy 
meets all -American girl. 80 's 
t yle, 

There were moments when 
writers Andrew lane and Wayne 
Crawford went overboard with 
the valley-ness of the film. For 
example: " like I am totally not 
in love with you Tommy," valley 
response, " Not too cool Julie, 
like I won 't be bummed out. ,," 
The dialogue, thankfully, does 
not remain this way, instead the 
speech turns into a satire of 
valley expressions. 

Th e greatest flaw in the til m is 
th e age of the stars. Neither 
Cage nor Foreman look like 
juniors in high school. The film 
itself was fun . The music by the 
Clash , the Jam and "Melt with 
You " by Modern English all add 
to the lightheartedness of the 
film . Valley Girl is not a thought 
provoking film , but if you are in 
the mood for a light. funny film 
it would certainly fit the bill. 

I 'Thunder' 
'hits home 

continued from page 9 
because this movie Is a political 
allegory for US military actions 
in Vietnam and EI Salvador. 
Flashback images of Vietnam 
are used to rev eal th e 
personality types of those who 
become involved in cove rt 
operations, and their complete 
disregard for th e lives of people 
whom they label as the enemy. 

Beca use there is no spec ific 
ba ttl egro und for terror ist's 
activities in the wor ld, the 
mil i tary feels tha t it is neces~ry 
to prepare for at tacks ;n any
