Che Cafe may close 
By DANIEL THOMAS, Swlf Wnw' 

TROUBLED by declining revenues and business, the he Cafe collective is 
debati ng whether to "red i reu" 
their efforts away from their 
traditional food service 
opcnltions and move toward 
catering and events 
programmll1g. Such a change 
could me.lIl the end of the daily 
short-order vegetarian cooking 
which has been done at the Che 
for the past five years. 

"If it comes down to a choice 
between the survIval of this 
business and restaurant service 
we're gOi ng to put the priorit)' ~n 
catering" aid Sue Spalding, a 
spokeswoman for the collective. 
The Che supplies sandwiches to 
the food co-op on a dady baSIS, 
and would also cater for 
programmed events at the cafe. 

The Che Cafe (named both for 
Cuban revolutionary Che 
Guevara and Cheap Healthy 
Eats) was begun five years ago, 
after an earlier operation the 
CofTee Hut, was elosed d~wn 
according to Spalding. "Srude~t 
volunteers cleaned up and 
i,rnproved the bUilding Structures. 
The two wings and the new 
Ooors were built by students. The 
cafe opened with just 
sandwiches at first and then 
whatever was convenient to 
cook." Over the next few years, 
"it built up to the pOint where 
events (such as music and 
poetry) were happening nearly 
every day," and the cafe was 
serving a regular, meatless menu 
all day long. By the end of last 
year, however, "it had expanded 
beyond demand," Spalding sa id. 

Through the faU quaner, the 
, collective members have looked 

at their economic situation and 
have wondered if they might do

better by concentrating on 
catenng rather than on food 
service. 

Other collective members 
J~ll1ed Spaldll1g in noting the 
ddltcliity of competing against an 
operation like the Pub, which 
receives money from the 
administration to pay for bands. 

palding said that the cafe 's 
income is so low that the 
workers cannot pay themselves 
even two-thirds of the wages that 
other on-campus food service \ 
workers receive. y 

"We want [0 run a good food 
service but also run an effiCIent 
business. If we don't have 
enough people to conSistently 
come here [Q suppOrt this as a 
restaumnt, we 're going to have to 
redirect (into catenng and events 
programming). We can 't be a 
restaurant unless we get enough 
regular volume of to be a 
restaurant. 

'The people who want 
vegetarian food on campus can 
afford to come here now but if 
we became like other vegetarian 
restaurants in San Diego (i.e., 
raised prices), most students 
could not afford to come here " 
Spalding said . For that reason ' 
she said, raising prices was n~t 
the answer. "Right now, a 
student can get a bowl of soup, a 
bagel and a glass of milk for 
$1.50. We have good , quality 
fooo and service. But we can't 
compete unless people suppOrt 
us," 

The cafe will continue to serve 
its regular menu, including daily 
speCIals and sandwiches 
throughout this week, Warn-
3pm, with breakfast on Tuesday 
and Thursday 8-lOam, and a 
dinner this Wednesday from 5-
7pm.

Referenda: what students recommend 
By KARIN JACOBSEN Stu.D Writer 

T HERE HAS BEEN a recent student opinion more than debate over whether the anything else. They're not always ASIO should continue aucd upon; only if the issue is 
to offer internships with the CIA timely and necessary," Alexander 
despite a student referendum last said . In order to be acted upon , 
spring in which a majority the referendum must be "within 
(1580-843) voted against the use the boundaries of power," she 
of student registratlon fees for said. "For instance , we could put 
on-campus recruitment by the a referendum on asking students 
ClA. The purpose of the if they suppon Reagan's summit 
referenda at UCSD have been trip to Geneva , but we wouldn't 
discussed at length . There is be able to au upon the 
general consensus among aU the outcome." 

Although the), arc advisory, the 
referenda do have an impact, 
according 10 AS adviser Randy 
Woodard . The AS acted on every 
one of the referenda passed last 
spring. "T hey were wher 
fOlwarded to the agency involved 
or 10 the vice chancellor. From 
thaI point it 's either up to the 
students 10 put pressure on the 
agency or up to the university to 
take action ." 

Attempts by the students to 

change administrative policy 
through referenda have for Ihe 
most part been unsuccessful. On 
the 1980-81 baUot students voted 
overwhelmingly against havmg a 
"W" placed on their record if 
they withdrew frolll a cluss at 
any time durlllg Ihe quarter 
( 1226-163). They also voted to 
move the drop date 10 the sixth 
week. As any student who has 
\vithdmwn from a c1as or 
dropped after fourt h week 

knows, neither of these referenda 
were effected. In the 1983-84 
election , the majority of the 
students voted agains t the +/ -
grading system (no 937, yes 
558). The administration chose 
to implement the rejected 
syslem.

"To represent students 
contrary to the spirit of the 
referenda would be tantamount 
to ignoring the student mandate 
whICh representatives are elected 
to represent." said student Monte 
Rosen. 

The referenda are "advisory 
votes from the student body to a 
certain group ," said AS President 
Mary Rose Alexander. 

"The CIA referendum was an 
advisory to Career Planning and 
Placement, which subsequently 
acted on the vote by banning

\ 

When the forefathers of what would become the United States of 
America sat down to draw up the world's most impres ionable 
document, the US Constitution, they were Virtually unaware of the 
volatile nature of pluralistic democracies. If they had been a bit more 
perceptive as to the dra onian longings of citizen once elected to hold 
power, our most widely quoted document might be more restrictive, and 
not so ~"prdia l to the tinkerings of public servants. The intentions of 
men suCh as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, one who set the 
framework for human fallibility, and the other for honest government, 
were pragmatic in orientation and waywardly idealistic in 
implementation. To think that we live under such an appropriate 
preamble that begins with, "We the people," and continues on in hopes 
of securing the blessings of liberty, the insurance of domestic tranquility 
and the promotion of the general welfare; can we possibly feel se ure 
that we are moving toward "a more perfect union?" For we can trace our 
progress more readily at the grassroots level of government, where the 
process of democratic representation is lucid and open to closer 
scrutiny. Here we discover the viability of governmental claims that the 

Bill of Rights is onsistently respected , th'at our ammendments hold 
water in modem dis ourse , that our votes and subsequent participation 
in the publi sphere are worth a hool. At UCSD our primary analogy is 
with the Associated tudent Council , and its ability to act in accordance 
with its creation, the ASUCSD Constitution , and also in its history 6f 
making Referenda (student d irectives or initiatives) into student law. 

Democracies will perish when the average varer believes his vote, or 
input, to be truly futile . While there are no guarantees that an elected 
government will ever act in the interest of its constituency, (especially 
when that "interest" is constantly changing), the masses do look for 
some checks and balances to secure against one group dominating the 
whole . Perhaps our dilemma with what one is to do with student 
referenda lies with the absence of a proper system of checks and 
balances. For instance, in a university utopian model the students would 
block misguided actions by the faculty and / or administration; the , 
administration would quell the overzealotry of student demand; the 
students would design a course curriculum that the faculty would 
modify; the faculty would develop research programs that the 
ad ministration would approve according to contemporary relevance, and 
so on until the circle rolls over again. But the students don't check the 
administration with much success (although the administration has 
"checked" the students over the boards and into the penalty box on 
many an occasion) and the faculty has grown far too isolated from the 
university "body-politic." Moreover, interest groups on campus usually 
encompass a variety of individuals from all three sectors - so the lines 
of allegiance are not easily drawn . 

If we look at what referenda have been passed during elections the 
last three years , we will find that each referendum, per se, has been 
addressed quite differently with each passing year. The referendum that 

banned the funding of the Calyomta I<evtew as a dIrect result of their 
inhumane remarks describing the rape of a woman at the hands of 
eight men in New Bedford twO and one-half years ago has been ignored 
this past semester due to a hody contested court case between the 
Review and the UC (the Review won and was granted office space) 
which resulted in heavy partisan pressure coming from alumni and the 
administration upon the shoulders of a young AS Council , to fund the 
Review. 

The special election called for and indirectly financed by the 
administration around the creation of the University Center one year 
and a half ago was UCSD's own version of Guatemalan-like elections -
where the number of students who had to vote to pass the referendum 
was changed from 25% to 20% on the day of the vote (as only 22% of 
the student population turned out). 

Also with two of the six referenda passed last spring do we discover 
rather curious results. The referendum concerned with insuring the 
survivability of CalPIRG by placing their name viSibly on registration fee 
cards (CaIPIRG urged the voters to choose a reg-card line item that 
made a voluntary contribution 1O the organization appear to be part of 
the locked-in activity fee, the administration lobbyed for a se perate 
category altogether) was "won" by CalPIRG lobbyists as their ca tegory 
gained the majority of votes, but then was quickly "lost" as the 
administration nullified the student choice with the help of the AS and 
chose their own "defeated" category. CalPIRG no longer exists at UCSD. 

The referendum that pledged to ban the use of student registration 
fees for the purpose of on-campus recruitment by organizations like the 
ClA was ironically declared as "unconstitutional" by this year's AS 
Council once it was tested by ASIO. The present state of other referenda 

follows: the Koala is not our mascot; there is no visible 

'''National Sanctuary Movement" alive at UCSD; the AS Council has a 
committee presently working diligently on cooperative housing; the UC 
Regents still invest in apartheid. 

These pins that are stuck in democracy's cushion were not just poked 
in by various AS Councils. In fact, the present Council does not have 
either the malicious drive that would characterize them as a tyranny, not 
the active resources available that would grant them the power to move 
mountains. The referenda are meaningless precisely because the 
students who voted for them walked away when it was time to apply 
them. That application includes an in-depth understanding of judicial 
process; if the referenda sponsors realized this, they would have helped 
construct the new AS Constitution , which does not even discuss the 
meaning nor the lawful instruction of referenda once they are passed . 
There is room in the AS Constitution, however, for ammendments. The 
answer to our present confusion over what referenda mean in 
application' lies within that constitutional framework: student activists 
and the AS Council should work hand in hand to pass an ammendment 
which defines the specific nature , and relevance-in-Iaw of referenda. We 
would also suggest the creation of a 'Judicial" branch of student . 
government that would actively address these problems - a "judicial 
board" that merely monitors AS Council activity is not nearly enough . In 
this manner, we can begin to reconstruct the governmental bodies that 
exist solely to prove the wisdom of the masses, not to test them.

OPINIONS 

When academia stifles ingenuity 
By RICHARD MCCLINTOCK 

MANY UCSD professors and administrators act as though they are 
always right when they disagree 
with students, and as though the 
students are always wrong. 

For example , many professors 
and administrators act as they 
know how well students do on 
examinations is a function of 
only the students' abilities and 
knowledge, and not a function of 
professors' abilities to judge 
students. Worse , some believe 
that professors' judgments reveal 
students' genetically detennined 
capaCities. This belief is 
influenced by the theory that 
inherited intelligence has been 
accurately measured by written 
tests (which are made by 
professors). This belief has 
gained additional power from 
some sociobiolgists' claims that 
the relationship between 
intelligence and genetiCS has 
been demonstrated with 
mathematical precision. 

I have been told by some 
UCSD teachers that this 
mathematical precision has 
resulted from the discoveries of 
the historical scientist Gregor 
Mendel. They have told me that 
before Mendel, biologists were 
mostly naturalists who collected 
butterflies and so forth, but after 
Mendel, biology became a serious 
mathematical science. They have 
said mat now the work that 
Mendel started has been 
developed so much that now the 
relationship berween genetics 
and intelligence can be 
investigated with mamematical 
rigor. 

One professor told me that he 
had read a reprint of Mendel's 
Original scientific paper. This 
professor told me mat he was 
impressed by how great Mendel's 
work was, because it is still valid 
(()day and still is an outstanding 
example of experimentation mat 
is mathematically correct. 

However, the professors I have 
talked (() have preferred to not 
learn some mings about Mendel. 

They have not wanted to know 
that when Mendel was tested by 
professors, he was failed . The 
professors who tested Mendel 
were sure that their tests 
accurately measured his abilities 
and knowledge and that he did 
not know enough about biology 
and other scie nces to pass. 

Mendel took this test to get 
credentials, but the reason that 
he failed was not that the test for 
his credentials that were so 
outstanding that almost no one 
could get them; the test was for 
credentials to teach at a high 
school. 

Before he took the test, 
Mendel had been a substi tute 
teacher, because he had been a ' 
priest (and monk), and at that 
time, in 1849, a priest could 
become a substitute teacher 
without taking an examination. 
Mendel wanted to become a 
pennanent teacher in high 
school, but to do that he needed 
to pass an examination 

Mendel took me examination 
in 1850. The examination was 
graded by univerSity professors . 
The professors said that Mendel 
did not know enough about 
biology and other sciences to 
teach at a high school. 

In 1856 he took the 
examination again, but again he 
did not pass it. Shortly after, in 
that year, he did not pass for the 
second time, he began the 
experiments for which he is now 
famous. 

Because he could not get 
impressive credentials, he was 
considered an amateur. He did 
not have eqUipment as expensive 
as mat bought by UCSD 
professors with NSF grants and 
other sources of funding. He got 
a little garden plot of ground 
where he grew peas and 
experimented by crossbreeding 
them. 

The people who knew him 
did not know much about what 
he was doing with those peas, 
and they did not care very 
much. His experimentation could

be justified as good for him 
because he was a substitute 
teacher and needed (() learn 
about science. 

In 1865 he went (Q a local 
science association meeting and 
gave a lecture about his 
experiments. The audience did 
not react as though his 
discoveries were importa nt. 
According to biographer Hugo 
litis , in Life oj Mendel 
(second/ impression in English , 
1966, Hafner Publishing 
Company, page 179), ''The 
audience dispersed and ceased 
to th i nk about the matter." 
Mendel 's lecture appeared in 

print , because me local science 
association had the cus(()m of 
having lectures given (() it PUt in 
print for future reference. Copies 
of Mendel's printed lecture 
gathered dust on shelves and 
were ignored . 

Mendel sent a copy of his 
primed lecture and wrote long 
letters to an eminent professor to 
tell him about the experimental 
results. The professor did not 
take the results of the little 
amateur experiments seriously. 
Biographers of Mendel's life do 
not know how many other 
professors in the scientific 
establishment Mendel wrote to,

because his discoveries were not 
taken very seriously and few 
records of his efforts were kept. 

After Mendel died, his name 
was almost forgotten among 
scie ntists. As the years passed , 
scientists who did not know 
about his discoveries gained 
more knowledge about genetics 
without his discoveries. Some 
scientists with the increased 
knowledge about genetics 
encountered the printed lectu re 
by Mendel. dusted it off, and 
read it. They decided that he 
had been ahead of his time, and 
sixteen years after his death 
scientists began (() write about 

his discoveries. According to 
biographers, if the local science 
associa tion had not been in me 
habit of printing the lectures 
given to it, then his amateur 
experiments would be unknown 
today. 

When his discoveries gained 
respect after his death, scientists 
and biographers went to where 
Mendel had lived to find out if 
he had done omer experiments 
in genetics. People who had 
known him remembered that he 
had been doing more 
experiments, but they said that 
they did not know if he made 
any more important discoveries. 
The scientists and biographers 

saId that if such discoveries had 
been made and if he had written 
about them, then his writings are 
treasures that should be found to 
contribute to scientific 
knowledge. However, because the 
people who had knwon him had 
considered him to be an amateur 
who could not pass 
examinations, after he died , they 
considered his scientific writings 
to have been trash and they had 
gotten rid of the trash. 

Like Mendel, mher histOrical 
scientists who are now ~ 
considered to be great successes 
were previously considered to be 
failu res. Such failure that later 
becomes considered to be 
'5uccess has not only happened 
in historical times, but is 
happening now in modem 
science. 

For example, in 1983 a Nobel 
Prize was given for a discovery 
that, as reported in several 
sources, the obel Prize 
committee called "the second 
great discovery" in genetics, the 
first great discovery being 
Mendel's. In this regard the 
Nobel Prize reflects me great 
respect that me scientific 
establishment now has for thi.s 
"second great discovery" (the 
discovery in which genes are 
found to move from place to 
place on chromosomes), and 
omer large prizes have been 
awarded for it. Yet years ago the 
discoverer was alone because 
established professors said that 
the discovery was wrong. The 
discoverer has been widely 
reported as stating, "They said I 
was crazy - absolutely mad." 

Although me academic system 
continues to make judgments 
that the system itself later 
decides were wrong, many UCSD 
professors and administrators 
continue to act as though their 
credentials within the system 
guarantee that their judgments 
are right. They ignore me history 
of ideas that UCSD and other 
universities were founded 
on.

This rclerendum, along with the

initially proposed by a group 
calling themselves the,Progressive

was involved in thiS group said 
that "thc sanctlialY committee

Women's Studies: On the 1981 -
82 ballot students voted in laval' 
of creatll1g a women's studies 
program at UC5D (1155-662). 
According to Women's Resource 
Center pokeswoman Paui 
Orozco, "Nothing has become of 
that VOle . There is no women's 
studies department at UC 0 
because the administration has 
not felt the issue to be an 
important one," Orozco said. 
"The admillistration ha~ never 
supported women on this 
cam pus or listened to our 
needs," she said. While there is 
a women's studies minor, there 
is no depanment, and all classes 
are cross-listed with other 
departments. 

KSDT Cahlc outlets: A 1981-82 
referendum expressed the

should be installed 111 on-campus 
housing facilities (yes 1373, no

that cables arc being laid on 
campus, but he did nm know 
the implications this would have 
at UCSD. AccordIng to Media 
Center Director Sherman George, 
ihe campus is being wired for 
cable, but the cabling "doesn't 
have anything to do with KSDT." 
He said that the new $580,000 
cable system will have video, 
data and security applications in

campus and added "it would 
probably cost another $100,000-
$200,000 to install cable outlets

She was not the only woman

A Tijuana journey reveals social conflicts 
By ART SAlAZAR, StUJJ \ mer 

RESIDENTS of Tijuana and <In Diego have developed 
. a relationshIp based on 
all take and no give Americans 
sought forms of entertainment 
that were vacation bargaIns and 
Mexicans were providing It for a 
price, TounstS Increased travel 

south as the peso contInued to 
plummet, not realizing that their 
country was partly at fault for 
MeXICO'S crippled economy. 

Citizens on both sides have 
desperately prepared for the 
holtday shopping season 
encroachIng upon us. The 

United States' government, 
commi tted to capitalist investors 
and its Mexiean counterpart, 
dedicated to the promotion of 
personal wealth , have seldom 
a ted lor the pUblIC s goou . I saw 
this first hand during a trip to 
Tijuana to collect research 
informallon. 

We were In a foreign country 
on a 'typical' night and so much 
occured. The bustling activity of 
thiS rcsort town reflected the 
difference In the perspectives 01 
the plcasure seekers, namely 
tourists, and the poor people , 
namdy Locals. That night my 
friend Greg and I walked the 
Tijuana streets to conduct 
research and solicit the opinions 
of the occupants. 

A patron at one of the c1uhs 
grabbed Greg by the shoulder. 
The man, dressed in wnnkled 
work clothes, asked, Greg, who 
was 10,lded down with camem 
equipment, to take his picture. I 
deduced that he was drinking to 
drown hiS sorrow~ because he 
told us, ''I'm a 1 J towner, With 
no hOlel , 1 lIve on the streets. It 
rarel)' gets thiS nice." He 
probably thought hiS dn.anken

As we walked to one of the

laught some filcfighters dousing

huses during the trip. There were 
numerous opportunities to study 
the discomforting faces of 
transients , who compri se 60 
percent of the population. 

Next, we exami ned the extent 
to wh ich tourists appear different 
than the Mexicans. At Tijuana 
Tilly's, a popular American club, 
the tourists could be spotted by 
their wardrohe . Photographs 01 
college groupics, dressed a la "51. 
Elm o's Fire," donned the entrance 
way, A couple of ladies, who Sat 
looking at menus, were weanng 
Boston College sweat tops and 
two busmessmen from Mexico 
City wore identical $200 wool 
suits. 

Ti lly's was careful to decorate. 
the place wi th consumers of both 
cultures in mind . From th e 
rafters of its dining areas hung 
pinatas, basketballs, bicycle tires, 
a collection of seven-lOch 
records, a variety of Snipped-off 
ties, and a L2-foot poster of a 
toreador. It looked like an 
acculturated venue of escapism. 

In Mexico there were very 
visible contrasts hetween 
affiuence and poverty. At one 
time nearly all of this country 
was owned by just five families. 
Its destitute people probably look 
across the border sometimes and 
wish for a little of our prosperit)'. 

Grim reality Juxtaposed near 
entertainment traps. Relations 
between our elties arc presently 
characterized by an animosity 
against travelers who have 
persisted in being thoughtless, 
disregarding those less fortunate . 

Yareli Arizmendi , a UCSD 
political sc ience major, explained 
why Mexicans feel bitter towards 
touri ts . "All Lati n Ameri cans see 
us as an imperialist power, 
where every person owns two 
ca rs, has twO children and twO 
houses. They fail to accept that 
we also have many internal 
oppressive problems to deal 
with ." 

Arizmendi believes the 
American government is 
accountable for indignation 
agai nst Mexico. "The country as 

a whole lost money by fronting 
petroleum they could n 't sell. 
They refused an of/er made by 
American invcstors to sell cru,je 
to us at below OPEC prices. 
When they said 'No: the U.s. 
created an oil glut on the world 
markct in retaliation . Mexico 
became even more financially 
unstable because they gambled 
on repaying their escalati~? 
national debts with petrol. 

Fortunes were lost with the 

dcvaluation. Anzmendi added, 
"The small examples of hardship 
are the bitterest pills to swallow. 
When th e peso took a divc , 
many politicians, clergy, and 
other crooks avoided losing big 
hucks because they were' 
informed of the crash 
beforehand . The media covered 
many stori es about vieji tas (liJ' 0)' 
ladies) who saw their life 's 
savings dwindle to petty cash, 
but sea rcely any stories of 
burea ucrats feeling the decline' 
effectS." 

During President Reagan's 
speech to Congress ovember 
21 st, he preached that one of his 
di plomatiC tactic's, in talks With 
Premier Gorbachev at the 
summit, was the ex hange of 
artists and their work. One way 
to better understand each other's 
eulture is through art ' 
appreeiation. Most tounsts only 
view Mexi an art in products 
being sold at the border crossing, 
such as velvet paintings of jlml 

Hendrix and Mickey Mouse, The 
world has pooh-poohed Mexican 
art as sub-standard , but this is 
far from true . 

Carmen Zapata, the talented 
bilingual actress of Los Angeles' 

Theatr~-Teatro , said, "Fedenco 
Garcia Lorca is the Spanish 
language equivalent of 
hakespeare, but how many of 

his plays. have you staged in the 
US?" 

jorge A. Huerta, a lead 109 
authority in Chicano Studies, 
mformed his unknowing class 

that thc II rst documented stage 
production in the US was done 
by a MeXican-American travehng 
troupe. "We're not In the hlStol),

"CantlnUas was a predecessor 
to Charlie Chaphn and othcr

reflects the brighter side of thiS 
city and its people. 

As we headed home , the final 
Impressions of the city came 
from the mmslents who stared at 
us with cold eyes. Greg turned 10 
me and said, 'The only way a 
person could ever empathize 
With these people is to walk 10 
their shoes." David Alberto , a 
professional actor from the ¥ 
United States, once tried 
crossing the border as an Illegal, 
without his Identification , to 
prepare for his role as EI Coyote

Stepping beyond the 
point of no return 

Do you doubt that you retain 
so little? How many of you 
remember who was the first to 
circumnavigate the world. or who 
discove red the Pacific Ocean, or 
what explorer spent his stupid 
Illtle life searehing arter the 
Fountain of Youth. or what Sir 
Frands Dr.tke actually did for a 
living? That's all founh grade 
hiStory slUfr; ask some ten-year-
old somewhere if you want the 
answers

months of continuity, to go IntO 
your final with confidence and 
pride and enough time to 
prepare ... and then to get out 
and forget 80% of whatever you 
Just learned 

But right now at UCSD the 
whole thing IS a moot point. The 
fact is . we 're in rhe throes of the 
tenth week, and no amoum of 
bllching and moaning IS geuing 
us OUt of it now, hecause there's 
no turning back. 

By PHIL LAUDER 
The end is at hand . 
This is it, the temh week,

twO gu),s meet and diSCUSS the 
fact that one of them was

Insrcad I kepr walking. and 
shook my head . Tisk , tisk. the 
tragedy of human suffering. I had 
encountered another victim of 
the quarter system . 

The quaner sYStc m IS qUite a

"quarter." Let me clue )'ou in . 
"Quarter" comes from thc Greek

LOnnecuon isn 't immediately 
obVIOUS to the avcmge layperson , 
lingUists hal'e found that the 
words "pain" and "terror" also

doesn't come as mu h of a 
surprise to me . though -
perhaps I[ seems clear to some

a grip on yourself. Listen to me , 
pal. It is 100 late . 

Why didn't you think or thiS

metaphorical and tell him that 
such action was akin to a jockey 
whose horse is sailing down the 
home stretch, losing m on the

At least finish . for God's sake. 

of you, too. 
The argument over which IS 

beuer. the seme ter or the 
quaner , will never end. I p'refer 
the semester. In my opinion, 
taking tWO sets of finals beats the 
hell out of ta~lIlg three setS of 
finals any day of the week. I also 
don 't think you can do justice to 
15 weeks of knowledge and cram 
it into ten . I don 't think it really 
works that wa)'. 

question right . and the game 
would \a~t five mmutes. long' 
enough lor rhe fir t person to roll

Instead. we are blessed With 
an educational system that allows 
us to remin one-fifth of what It 
dishes out. And that's the (linage 
retention ; think about what that 
rum into on the quaner system . 
where you trip through each 
course at a cha pter-a-week 

I wtsh you well. I Wish you the

wish you would not let the 

Pretty bad news. 

pres ure get to you toO much . I 
wish you would realize that it's 
only a test and that the only 
thmgs really al stake are ),our 
chances of getting out of here 
and your odds at getting a Job 
that pays better than waiting 

table~ at Bob's Big Boy. 

Keep that in mind and sta), 
ca lm . Good luck on finals . See 

Besides, you didn't really wam 
to drop your classes in the ninth 
week, did you' Dropping in the 
ninth week is sad . I was walking 
down the main drag last 

Studies have shown thar 
students retain an average of one 
fifth of what they take in during 
their scholastic lives. One fifth . 

0 , I'm a not a fan of the 
quarter system. The semester 
gives you fifteen weeks to devote 
to each subject. That gives you 
time to really get into the meat of 
things. to give the subject some you in Januaty. ~

Triton Water-Polo claims NIT crown 
By DAVID TEDROW, Stajj \,\Inter 

T HE TRITONS arc champions, It 's that simple, '0 nowery 
adjectives can add to their 
accomphshment , nor do (hey 
deserve anything less, The 1985 
U SD men's water polo won the 

auonal Invitational Tournament 
a week ago by playmg the type 
of ball It takes to win 
championshIps. 

The TrilOns didn't JU t Win (h e 
tOurnament, they domInated it. 
In succesive games they beat 

anl"<l Clara 16-5, Loyola-
Marymount 18-2, Cal- tate 
Pullenon 14-7 , Claremont-Mudd 
9-6 and Cal- tate Los Angeles 
16-6 10 the hampIOnship. The 
stats speak lor themselves; an 
eight goal average margin of 
vi lOry and a shooting 
percentage of 60. In addition , 
UC D scored 30 counterattack 
goals while nO[ allowing any to 
be scored agamst them. 

If you don't want to listen to 
the stats, then Just hstcn to the 
players: Larry andel'S said , "We 
played as a team , we had a 
balanced attack and everyone 
conrnbuted ." "That was the 
fun nest pan , we played together 
reaUy weU," added senior Dan 
Kahl , "We went into the lOurney 
wanting to kIll every team. We 
didn't just want to beat them, we 
wanted to show lhat they didn't 
belong in the same pool with 
us." Tom Moore said , "It was our 
best tOurnamenr of the year and 
everyone really played greal." 
Duncan MIllar, however, felt that 
"The pool was lOO cold ." 

Every game 10 the lOumey was 
a lopSided wm for the Tritons, 
with the exception of the 
Claremonr game "It was a tOugh 
game , but we were in control the 
whole way through," commented 
coac h Denny Harper. "We 
figured 10 play rhem in the finals 

on Sunday," aid Moore, "but 
ins tead , we wound up playing 
them on Saturday aftemoon 
because they losl earlier 10 al-
(ate LA" They could have 

played a week from last Tuesday, 
but it wouldn 't have mattered. 
U D howed lhat they wele 
(he class of (he field . 

In addition to the team 
championship, several Triton 
players received individual 
honors with Kahl , Sanders, and 
Millar beIng named 10 the all -
tournament first team. Also , 
Moore , who made 16 of his 19 
shots (84 percent), \ViIS selected 
to the second team and j o Wade 
and jeff Smith were honorable 
mentions. 

The vlclOry 10 the finals was 
the eighth in a row for the 
T mons after several losses to top 
10 DiviSIOn I teams. But UCSD 
made the most of those losses 
and became even more 
determined to win the rest of 
their games."After the Pac 10-
PCM tourney we had a team 
meeting," said Harper, "We 
talked about the rest of lhe 
season and I knew they were 
going to go 8 and 0; I could see 
It 10 their eyes." The victory was 
also the) 9th of the season - a 
UC D record . 

The IT championship was 
JUSt one of many 
accomplIshments for this year's 
squad , Others in luded only one 
loss against teams not ranked in 
the top 10 in Division I and 
victories over Division I lOp 10 
teams Pepperdine , Fresno State 
and Loyola-Chicago. A couple of 
players se t indiVidual school 
records also. Millar broke his 
own season record for the mo t 
goalie saves with 302, setting a 
new mark In the process. jeff 
Smith set season records with 50 
steals on the yea r and by

drawing seven 4-meter penalty 
shots for the Tritons. 

All Ihe members of the team 
agreed that the season was a big 

. success and that the NIT 
championship more than made 
up for two tough losses to Pacific 
and Loyola-Chicago early in th e 
season. "We should have won 
those games: said Moore, "and 
\\~ns In those games would have 
helped our l\ational ranking. 
Hopefully we'U be ranked ) 2th 
since we beat everyone by so 
much 10 the NIT." 

The Tritons always sta rt the 
year with an outside shot at 
making the Division I CAA 

tournament, but the way the 
tourney is SCt up UCSD would 
have to be among the top five 
teams in Division L Need less to 
say, this is a bit much to expect 
from a Division III team without 
enough money to set up a water 
polo program the calibre of some 
of the DiVision I teams. "Making 
the NCAA is becoming less and 
less of a big deal due to the way 
It 'S set up, and because the NIT 
tourney is growing and getting 
beuer each year," said Harper. 
Although the TrilOns could play 
norhing but dtvision III teams all 
season long, go undefeated and 
wi n the NIT, th ey still choose to 

play Division I powerhouses. Ot 
only do they choose to, it 's one 
of the reasons players decide to 
come to UC D. Explained Phil 
Penis, "It's good to know we can 
play with Division I sc hools and 
when we look back on our 
careers we'll know we played 
agai nst the best players in the 
nation , against current national 
team members and against past 
and future olympians." 

No other Division III or 
Division II team can say that and 
no other Division II team is as 
good at what they do than the 
UCSD men's water polo 
champions. ~ 

Men's Roundball off to 
exciting 2 -0 start 
By MAlT lAlT, Staff Writer 

I F YOU like watching fastbreaks, big leads, comebacks and ovenimes, 
and if you enjoy cheering while 
Sitting on the edge of your seat, 
holding your breath and crossing 
your fingers on last-second free 
throws, and looking at opposi ng 
cheerleaders cheer a lOSing 
cause , then you would have 
loved the Tritons opening game 
victory against the Univers ity of 
Redlands, an NCCA News-ra ted 
team, in ovenime 89-80 last 
Saturday. On Wednesday, UCSD 
won again only this time it was 
more of a blowout as tRey 
walked over Occidental 108-93, 

In the o pent ng game agai nst 
the Bulldogs, coach Marshall 
stayed true to his promise about 
having "an exci ting team." People 
wi th high blood pressure or 
weak hearts would not have been 
advised to watch thIS game. 

This is not to say that this was 
a picture-perfect WIn for the 
'Jri tons. It wasn 't, it Just had 
great drama , even If much of it 

W<l~ self-Inflic ted . 
In the lirst half, the Tmons 

revealed their new full COurt 
press which totally confused the 
Bulldogs. Also In the first half, 
the Tritons pulled down some 
key rebounrl s and made cruCial 
steals. Returning st<lrters Greg 
Kamansky and Bill Reese were 
"money" from the outSide. 
Kamansky popped severa l 18 
foot corner lay-ups whIle Reese 
hit hiS qUick set jump shots from 
around thc key. At the end of 
the half, UCSD was up by ) 4 
points an d the game looked In 
the bag, 

The TritOns played 
impressively but they were aided 
by the fact that Redlands shot 
only 30 percent from the field in 
the first half, Marshall knew that 
"the second half would be a 
different StOry." And it was. In 
the secod half, "We didn't 
execute well. We got ranled , 
which is typical of a young team 
that hasn't played tOgether long," 
said Marshall . 

Only two minutes intO the 
half, starting guard Jim Smith , a 
transfer from Fullenon ]C, 
injured his ankle and was out of 
the line-up. Smith did a fine job 
quanerbacking the fastbreaks 
and the offense. Marshall said, 
':JIm is a good player, a little 
frantic at times, but he is rea ll y 
smart and sees the court well . He 
keeps me aware of things 
happening 10 the game." When 
mith was out of the game the 

lead slipped to s ix POintS. The 
InJulY wasn't senous and he 
ca me back with 12 manutes Icrt. 

But the Bulldogs refused to 
d Ie They hIt their shots and 
wuh onl>' 30 econds left , the 
Tritons found th emselves on the 
shan end of a 69-70 ball game. 

NIne teen seconds left and 
startCl' Brian Bach'ns, .mother 
tmn sfe r, was at the line shooting 
one and one. The pressure was 
on. These free throws were do or 
die. But Backens kept his pOise 
as he drained both shots, putting 
the TritOns back up by one. 
Backens IS said by his teammates 
to be an incredible shoote r. lie 
we nt 10-11 from dle line and 5 
for 10 from the fteld ending wuh 
20 POintS, second only to 
Kamansky's team high 21. 

Marshall calls Backens, "A great 
playe r who is reaUy going to go 
off in several games." 

After the free throws, Redlands 
came down the coun and with 
six seconds to go, Reese 
committed an ill-advised foul. 
The Bulldog made the first 
bucket. At thal point Marshall 
"got very nervous. The crowd 
was great though . They made a 
lot of noise and it helped him 
miss the second shot." 

"As 500n as we gOt into OT I 
knew we were going to win ," 
said Marshall, "Our guys were 
ready to win the game and they 
were relieved that they didn 't 
hand the game to the other team 
on a silver platter." 

In the first couple of minutes 
the Tritons pumped in 10 
unanswe red pOints making the 
score 81-72. Even then the 
Bulldogs refused to quit They 
came within 3 pOints with 52 
seconds left , hut were unable to 
stop the Triton!> in thm 89-80 
upset. 

After Redlands, M"",h,11I 
expected "10 heat Occi uent,,1 ,.

controlled the pace . 

The game stal1ed slowly with

Backens all chipped In to hUlld a 
49-36 lead at halftime. 

The seco nd hall' was marc of

By ERICA GLENNON, StuJj Wntcr 

W HEN Lyle Yates assumed the position of head baseball 
c ach in 1982, he envisioned a 
five -year plan for the team. This 
plan included recruiting players 
from other colleges and high 
se hools, developing bener college 
athletes and most importantly, 
Instilling a winning attitude in 
the minds of the players. Back in 
1982, the Tritons often took the 
field with the idea that they 
would probably lose. And they 
usually did . 

1986 is the fifth year of Yates' 
five year plan . And this year 
promises to be the best ever. 
While the season doesn 't 
officially start until the first week 
of February, the Tritons arc 
already involved in the pre-
season competition known as 
Fall Ball . "It's important to set 
foundations for the spri ng and 
I've noticed dramatically that the 
team knows they can win, You 
even get the feeli ng that th ey 
decide what inning it's going to 
happen," says a proud Yates. 

The Tritons arc already 
showing wmning signs. They arc 
currently at Il WInS, 4 los~es, 
and one tic . Three' of thei r losses 
were 10 DIVision I challengers, 
an Diego tate and USIU. 

Part of the Tritons pre-season 
strength IS due to the I I' ollensc . 
The tealll IS an experienced one 
thi s year, dominateu by JUnIors. 
"Our number onc strength is our 

offe n e, " comments Yates. 
"There arc no routi ne outS -
The pitchers faC ing us must 
apply themselves ." Thc Tritons ' 
ba tting order conSISts o f several 
players who arc career ,300 
hitters. Dave Stanovich , Dan 
DiMascio, Bob Natal , Derek 
Alknois and Don Petersen make 
up the .300 club. DiMaseio, 
Alkonis and Na tal are the 
nucleus of the line-up, and 
according to coach Yates , "could 
hun you wi th one swing of the 
bat at any time. Thcy have the 
potential to get dralted at the 
end of the season." 

The main concern now facing 
the team is how their pitching 
staff will fare . Lcd by seniors 
Mark Sloan and Prank Califano, 
the team is not without pitching 
talent. Sloan has been the ace of 
the pitching staff the last tWO 
years. "Hc's the guy we put on 
the mound In our biggest 
games," says Yates. Mark has a 
record of I 3-9 these past twO 
years, with an ERA of 3.24. 
.Cali fano was plagued hy Injuries 
last sea on , but was 3-0 in the 
games he pitched. The proble n 
the team faces is depth . The 
Tritons had looked rorward to 
using Junior Mike Petersen , who 
was unable to finIsh last season 
due to what was (hought to be 
tendiniti s. 13ut th e inJul')' to 
Mike's shoulder has proved to be 
an injUry to his rotator cuff and 
he Will be undergoi ng surgery. It 

But the team represents 
experience, and there is 
definitely a more positive and 
competlve attitude within the 
team. In add it ion to coach Yates,

Coach Yates seems quite 
optimistic ahout this year's

planned on. We started at the

many legitimate college athletes. 
But the progr..lm has developed, 
and it's time for us to show the 
benefits ," adds Yates. He feels 
the team wi ll be disappointed 
with anything less than a benh 
in th e Western Regionals. 

Lyle gives hiS players a lot of 
credi t for the work that they 
have put Into the program. "I 
ha ve noth ing but respect for the 
players that panicI pated rrom

academiCS and the progmm is 
admirable ." HopcfuU}', the team

students ages 17-2.5," said Tad 
Yamaguchi , director of lab 
proced ures. 

The evaluation mcludes the 
following measurements' cardIaC 
risk analYSiS, hean rate, blood 
pressure, fa t mass, nexibillty, 
height and weight. Strength tests 
of isolated muscle groups arc 
determined by sit-ups and push -
ups and ca rdIOvascular fi tness is 
ascenained by a "Cooper's Test" 
which mvolves a 1.5 mile run . 
These tests can cost up to $200 
elsewhere , hut arc free to UCSD 
students. 

The program IS the bramchHd 
of Vice Chancellor joe Watson in 
cooperation with faculry and staff 
of the P.E . department. Watson 
asked the sta ff to volunteer their 
time and create a fitness 
program complete with 
counse ling and follow-up testing. 

Dr. jack Douglass, the 
coord inator of the progr<lm said 
that "the whole idea is to get 
student!> phYSIcally fit. There's a 
theory that if you establish an 
exercise routine by the tIme 
you're 25 , you'll most likely stay 
involved with It permanently." 
He also 5<,id that exerCising can 
"make you feci better about 
yourself and hetter the quality of 
),our Ide " 

To suppleme nt rhe exercise 
aspect of the program there are 
the equaUy imponant stress 
ll1angement and nutrition 
components. Each of these 
clements has expens to counsel 
students and teach them how to 
Incorporate new hfestyles into 
their dally routlnes.
