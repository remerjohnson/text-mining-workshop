Reaction to Tuesday's sit-in 
What about affirmative 
action for UCSD women? 
Editor: 

I'm glad to see that UCSD 
students are not apathetic 
with regard to faculty job 
security, at least where 
minority faculty are 
involved, and that they have 
forced the chancellor to 
concede to the LA Times, 
"The only tenure appoint-
ments that will be made in 
the future will be either 
minority faculty or 'true 
stars whom the university 
must seek." 

I, however, would like to 
know what has happened to 
affirmative action for 
women. Students (again 
according to the Times) 
pressed demands for "more 
American Indian, Asian, 
Black and Chicano programs 
and faculty members," while 
last month an offer of a 
tenured position to a well-
known Italian semiotician 
was withdrawn because she 
is, in judgement of Atkinson 
and John Miles (head of 
academic affirmative action 
n this campus), not such a 

star. 
Other women continue to 

be passed over for tenure and 
merit increases because they 
have done only as much as 
men to earn them. For those 
:>f us who have watched 

sexism on this campus over 
the past dozen years, none of 
this is surprising. There are 
more women faculty on 
campus than "minorities," 
according to the academic 
affirmative action office (224 
women, or 16.2 percent , 
compared with 198 minori-
ties, or 7.4 percent), but at the 
tenured level the proportions 
are reversed (39 women, or 
oops

The university does not fight fair 
Editor: 

The demonstration in the 
Chancellor's Complex 
Tue day was an event of 
great significance for many 
people, particularly for the 30 
odd people who we r e 
arrested. It was also a 
significant learning experi -
ence for thoseof us watching. 
Many people would general-
ize the crowd of onlookers to 
be either fervent advocates of 
tenure for Tolbert or cynical 
student on their way to class 
who just wanted to get on TV 
or see what wasgoingon . But 
to many people like myself, 
the demon st ration left 
indelible impressions 
ranging from sadnes, to 
frustration at our own 
inaction , to not a little anger 
at the univers ity's militant 
response. 

Almost all of the arre ted 
demonstrators were Black. 
Now mo'l people would ay 
that I don 't understand the 
fru tration and anger that 
Blacks feel because I'm 
White. Maybe that's true -
but as I watched the 
individuals being brought out 
handcuffed on Tuesday, their 
expressions told me things I 
felt that I did under tand. 
Here were people who were 
secure enough in their 
convictions to go to jail for 

- what they believed. They 
though that keeping one good 
Black professo r in a 
univer ity who e mainten-
ance of affirmative action 
standards is lamentable was 
important enough to sacrifice 
for - to me that was 

awesome. I wanted to reach 
out and touch all of t hem , 
congratulate and encourage 
them. Unfortunately, I wa 
too weak and afraid to do so at 
the time. 

r a lso made up my mind 
then and there about the 
"tenure for Tolbert" iss ue. I 
have never had Professor 
Tolbert in a cla ,nor do I 
know very much about him. 
And I am not generally in 
favor of policy-making by 
violent coer ion. But this was 
not a violent demonstration. 
It was peaceful. a fact that 
the rally organizers s hould be 
proud of. The point was made 
in the mo t effective way -
the Tolbert movement gained 
legitimacy by not being 
violent. 

But it was wrong that the 
i sue had to go even this far . 
Students should not have to 
face arre t just to have input 
into deci ion ' that affect 
t hem, Tolbert and the 
stu dent s supporting him 
have exhausted nearly every 
normal cour e of action open 
to them. They have been 
frustrated at every turn by 
my teriou ' and formidable 
obstacles. How important are 
the e tenure requirements 
anyway? How good a cholar 
must Tolbert be? Even if one 
belie ves that T olbert' s 
scholarship is below par 
(which is debatable in light of 
the review his book has 
received), must we always 
sacrifice teaching ability for 
"publi sh or perish?" There is 
a noticeable lack of balance at 
this uni ver ity between 
sc holar s and teachers . 

Students 10 e too often a a 
re ult of t he e mysterious 
deci ions . 

But [ didn't mean this 
essay to be ju , t a pro- tudent 
input argument. I also saw a 
little bit of fear in the eyes of 
tho e arres ted Tuesday. It i 
not difficult to understand 
why people are fearful of 
being handcuffed, tuffed in 
the back of a van and taken 
God know where. It isn ' t the 
police department's fault -
they try to be nice about it-
but it s just a horrifying 
experience to be apprehended 
a bout a crime. A police record 
can ruin someone's life. 

No, it wasn't a fair fight. 
The university had all the 
forces of law and decency on 
their side Tuesday - clean-
cut , helmeted patrolmen in 
white cars who quietly and 
efficient ly went about their 
duties whi le nattily dressed 
detective tood Iby to field 
question from TV crews. 
The demon tration was an 
instance of trespassing; the 
participants interfered with 
the daily work routine in the 
Chancellor' s Complex; they 
violated propert}' rights -
they didn't work through the 
ystem. Those are all clean· 

cut American values right ? 
What chance does a group of 
oddly dres ed, angry and 
vociferous students have 
against thi s massive public 
relations effort? 

Arrest i ng these people 
in s tead of work ing with them 
is ju t too easy , too 
de tructive.

Students aren't deserving their 
role in VC U A search process 

Editor: 
As the search process for 

the new vice chancellor of 
undergraduate affairs draws 
to a close, only one complaint 
need be voiced - the lack of 
student concern over who is 
to fill this position. Every 
student had the opportunity 
to voice their concerns and 
appraisals of each candidate 
by attending the hour and a 
half long brown bag eminars 
held by each individual. 
Saying that 30 students 
attended these open forums 
is stretching the facts . This is 
not to mention the lack of any 
in depth press coverage by 
the Guardian. 

As a student member of the 
search committee who 
argued for the extensive 
student time during the two-
day interview process and got 
that time for students to meet 
each candidate and voice 
their concerns, I am 
embarrassed by the lack of 
student interest. If students 
had not been allocated the 
amount of time they had you 
can be sure a lot of static 
would have been heard by the 
committee and by the 
Chancellor. 

Students really have no 
reason to say one word when 
the decision i made, for they 
each had the opportunity to 
be a vital part of the earch 

process and did not take 
advantage of that opportun· 
ity. They houldJivewith the 
decision in s ilence, since that 

is the attitude reflected 
during the actual search 
process.

Editor: 

As the Third World 
Student Organizations we 
would. like to clear up a few 
misconceptions which might 
have arisen concerning 
yesterday's demonstration 
and sit-in. 

First, the sit-in was not 
held by the stu dent 
organizations but by the 
Third World Student 
Groups. This in noway is our 
way of backing down or away 

from the iss ue; this is our 
econd point. 

Second, we as the student 
organization s strongly 
endorse the seven demands 
presented Dr. Atkinson , and 
we support the non-violent 
actions taken by the Third 
World Student Groups.

Joe's Escort Service to have 
longer hours - Olaybe 

BY LISA SULLIVAN 
Staff Writer 

Cramming for finals will be nerve-racking, 
but for women, these late nights in the library 
also bring an increased danger of rapes and 
other assaults . 

So AS President Jules Bagneris feels 
com mitted to relieve those fears by extending 
the hours of Joe's Escort Service next week. 

His effort is running into trouble, though . 
Last week Bagneris and other AS members 

put an ad in the Guardian seeking tudent . 
escorts to volunteer about two and a half 
hours of their time. 

Only two have responded . 
Bagneris knows that finals week isn't the 

best time for recruiting volunteers, but he 
says the small turnout is also due to a lack of 

public~ty, student involvement and monetary 
mcentIVe. 

Because of inadequate advertis ing funds , he 
feels that many students are unawareofJoe's, 
which currently operates Monday through 
Thursday from 7:30 pm to 12:30 am on 
campus. 

The Guardian could have provided free ads, 
he suggested . because of the series of articles 
on rape pu blis hed earlier this quarter. 

Extended service next week "doesn 't seem 
likely," s aid Bagneris. 

"Without money or some sort of no-
pecuniary reward, we can't expect people to 
donate time." 

There is controver y over whether J 's 
e cort should be paid: some beli ve it hould 
cont!nue on a voluntary basis a a community 
servIce, but others feel that paying e cort is 
the on ly way to ensure reliable ervice. 

Joe' began a a voluntary ervice several 
years ago, and co·founder Jeff Te luk think it 
should remain so. 

Tesluk believe t hat some of J 's receipts 
might have been jimmied to how an incorrect 
amount of debits, and that the number of 
escort a week have been exaggerated to 
obtain extra funding. 

There i a general concensus that crime 
prevention mu t be bolstered, but there is less 
agreement on who hould a ume the costs . 

The AS feels that they should not be st uck 
with the entire burden since crime is a 
campus-wide problem. • 

The Administ ration , on the other hand, 
feel s that the crime rate s imply reflects the 
University as a microcosm of society. 

Bagneris said he favors joint funding by the 
AS, the Administration and Campus Police , 
without the dominance of any group in 
admini tering tho e fund . 

"I never want to see the police department 
have full control over the escort service 
because they won 't be sens itive to students' 
concerns," he said . 

But Bagneris said that the AS may 
contribute $2,500 to a proposed campus-wide 
crime prevention plan which would be 
headquartered at the police department. 

If approved, the $90,646 a year plan will 
consolidate the efforts of police , and such 
groups as Joe 's and the Rape Prevention 
Education Program, into a s ingle financial and 
administrative uni t. 

According to the proposal, this "crime 
prevention unit " would be administered 
from the police department to provide 
supervision "of a nature 0 as to limit t he 
potential liabi lity of the University." 

The unit would also handle bike 
registration , animal regulation , campu 
lighting monitor and gen eral campu 
ecurity urveillan . 
If the plan doe not go through , Bagneri 

said the A may allocate the $2,500 directly to 
Joe·s. 

Other n:oney for Joe' may orne partially 
from an Increase in tudent activity fee 
which Bagneri say he'll pro po e in a pial 
referendum n xt fall. 

If each tudent's fee were increased by four 
to ix dollars per quarter, he said that about 33 
and 1I3¢ from each tudent cou ld go toward 
Joe' . 

With a projected enrollment of 8300 
students next fall, a total amount of about 
$8200 could be allocated . 

Joe ' estimate that about 'lO,OOOi n ded 
each year for adequate ervi e .

The arre ted tudent ,rno t ly Blacks, were arrested by San

His tenure and a number of other demands will be the focus I 
of today' rally. chedul d for noon at Revelle Plaza. 

According to Ken Overton, chairman of the Black Students 
Union and one of the arre ted student, the rally and 
su b equent picket are intended to "make sure everyone knows 
thi i not a one·shot deal. " 

Overton said the it-in, which drew at one point a crowd of 
about 300 student and reporter to the Chancellor' Complex 
"wa n 't a victory" and needed to be followed up by anothe; 
rally. 

" It was worth it," Overton said of the arre ts. " But we didn't 
get our demands met. It wa n't a victory." 

Overton said he doe not anticipate a recurrence of 
Tue day's events, in which armed police riot squads were 
called in to break up the dis turbance.

Bagneris tightly 
controls council 
Wants us flag at meetings, puts 
a time buzzer on AS speakers 

BY JENIFER WARREN 
Staff Writer 

Jules Bagneris' AS is definitely 
not Jeremy Charlton's AS . 

Charlton, the Silly AS pres ident 
last year , thought people took their 
student government too seriously, 
so he was inaugurated in a bathrobe 
and a party hat . 

Bagneris, or his supporters, in the 
few weeks he has held office: 

- have said they hope to erect US 
and California flags in the North 
Conference Room (w here the 
Council meets each Wedne day) in 
an effort to "create a more 
professional atmos phere"; 

- have insta lled a timer to 
measure the amount of time spent 
discussing each agenda item; a bell 
sounds when debate must stop; 

- ha ve arranged Council 
members in an "orderly" fashion at 
tables set in a semi·circle around 
Vice President Alma Key , who 
stande behind a podium; 

-have initiated a moment of 
silence, dedicated at each meeting to 
a person or cause or both, following 
the roll call at the each meeting, also 
terminated by the bell; . 

- have begun a fifteen minute 
"council caucus" shortly after the 
meeting begins; originally created 
as a Council social hour, the caucus 
gives members a chance to discuss 
or lobby for certain agenda items; 

- have given Key, who chairs the 
meetings. a far more active role 
than many past vice presidents, 
encouraging her to scold the 
Council in a stern tone throughout 
the meetings in an effort to 
maintain order. 

Ever since he took the political 
reins from Bill Topkis three weeks 
ago, AS President Jules Bagneris 
has done everything possible to 

make his AS Council a "profession· 
al and effective" body which 
conducts itself with the utmost 
decorum. 

So much for the "silly" approach 
to st udent government. 

To those who have observed the 
AS over the years, this effort is a far 
cry from the policy of past 
presidents, most notably Charlton, 
who won the presidency las t year on 
a s illy platform but resigned soon 
after. 

Charlton placed an informal, 
'anyone can participate in student 
government' label on the AS , and 
took steps to make the Council 
humorous and causua. Bagneris 
insists, on the other hand , that the 
AS needs " respect " to be 
"legitimate" and has tailored his 
behavior as the chief executive 
toward that end. 

The idea behind these changes? 
"Since we took office, Alma and I 

have been hying to st ress 
effectiveness to the Council 
members," says Bagneris. "We feel 
matters should be conducted in a 
business· like manner so the Council 
feels important, feels good about 
what it 's doing." 

The flags, Bagneris argues, are "a 
symbol of a more professional 
atmosphere," an effort to "increase 
the legitimacy of the 'AS by 
improving the physical environ· 
ment of its meeting quarters. " 

"Personally, I don't tnink AS 
meetings are the proper place for 
flag worshipping,' says Commis· 
sioner of Student Welfare Reggie 
Williams. "The only index for 
professionalism is effectiveness, 
how much work you get done, not 
flags. " 

Atkinson responds 
conlin ucd ft'um pUj.!c J 
large group oi mos t I] Black 5t udents, 
Atkin 'on praised t he demon." rator ' 
for being "courteous and effl!cti've." 
" I don 't have any bitterness toward 
the tudents who were involved (in the 
s it·in)," he aid . "In fact, I would say 
they wer very cou rteous ." 

It was Atkinson' first confront· 
ation with student , and a ometimes 
vociferous one. At is ue was the denial 
of tenure for Black History Assistant 
Professor Emory Tolbers, plus a 
number of other demands calling for 
improvement in Third World 
programs. 

After unsuccessfully trying to lure 
protesters out of hi s office during the 
two hour sit· in and after issuing 
several unheeded threats of arrests, 
Atkinson ordered police to remove the 
student on the grounds of unlawful 
assembly. 

"What was done was appropriate," 
Atkinson said. "I think I made every 
effort to inform i.he students that [was 
going to clear the office. I told them

(Conference Room) 111, I would have 
the room cleared." 

Yet in 1978, then ·Chancellor 
William McElroy reacted much more 
patiently wit h a group of 21 student 
prote ter!:' , who held a sit·in in his 
office in support of the Daycare 
Center. 

McElroy allowed the students -
some of whom brought their children 
with them - to remain in his office for 
three days before finally deciding that 
negotiations would not proceed 
further . Like Atkinson, he then 
ordered police to arrest the student 
protesters. 

"[ do not think it was wise," 
Atkinson said of his predecessor's wait 
to arrest the students. "I think 
everyone should abide br, the same 
building occupancy rules. ' 

(Many UCSD buildings, including 
the Chancellor's office, officially close 
at 4:30 pm weekdays.) 

Yet when asked if ordering arre ts 
was his only option - his last resort-
Atkin on s idestepped the que tion by 
answering, "I judge it to be 
appropriate. " 

Ken Overton, chairman of the Black 
Students Union ;::nd one . of the 
arrested protester , disagreed . 

"I don't think it was necessary to 
bring the police in," he told the 
Guardian. "He (Atkinson) should have 
agreed to our demands, or at least 
negotiated seriously with us." 

What will be the effects of 
Tuesday's incident? 

San Diego media kept the sit·in and 
arrests form being a campus ecret. 
The event made the front page of local 
and regional newspapers and was the 
lead story on all local television news 
s hows Tuesday night. 

But such publicity will probably not 
discourage Third World people from 
attending UCSD, Atkinson said. 

"I hope it won 't deter minority 
tudents from coming here, or keep 

minori ty facult y mem her from 
teaching here."

Off-campus housing costs to rise 20OJo? 
That's what Del .Mar realtors say, and housing will be ~Cdrce 

BY BLAKE SHAW 
A .. odate Newa EdltOl' 

Remember last fall, when you searched for a place 
to live? Or are you an on-campus resident who will 
move off campus for the first time next fall? 

While it may not be Quite the time to start 
pounding the pavement, it is time to start planning 
for that move, according to Gloria Spencer, head of 
the UCSD Off·Campus Housing Office. And don't be 
shocked to find availability down and prices up, she 
warns. 

The prospects for next year have not improved 
any over this year's tight, expensive market. 
"Affordable housing within an easy commute to 
UCSD is still really tight," Spencer says. "LaJollan 
and Del Mar, of course, are resort areas, with very 
high property values. This fact, coupled with the 
continued increase in enrollment at UCSD, 
continued inflation, a heavy influx of non·students 
to this area due to the growth of the nearby research 
complexes and improved shopping facilities, just 
keeps forcing prices up, out of the range of most 
students. " 

How high? Mary Otavka, of the Jeller. Company, a 
Del Mar Real Estate Office, predicts, • I think you'll 
seea20percent increase in prices over last year. The 
three bedroom {)Iace that went for $600 last vear 
may go for over 1700 this year." This increase is an 
area-wide phenomenon, not restricted to Del Mar. 
"The best strategy for students would be to check 
everythi~: realtors, your housing office and ads in 
the paper. '

Spencer says that the tight local market is 
causing students to look farther away for housing 
this year. "I find more students than ever giving up 
trying to find a place close to campus and driving 
from places as far away a La Mesa, Poway and 
Leucadia. Also, many students are moving back in 
with their parents." 

There is good news, however. The demand for 
student apartments next year will be in part filled 
by an increase in the nubmer of Mesa Apartments. 
There are 70 newly built four·student apartments 
for single undergraduates scheduled for fall 
occupancy and at least 80 out of a total of 120 
graduat~ and residential apartments now being 
built will be ready for occupancy this fall. 

The housing office has a wealth of free 
information in the form of specially prepared 
booklets and forms such as "The Students Guide to 
Rental Housing" and various legal forms which it 
encourages students to fill out with their landlords 
before moving in. 

Probably the most used service the office offers is 
the roommate sharing board .. Business in the office 
is picking up rapidly as students search for summer 
housing. But this does not match the frantic activity 
which occurs in late August and early September. 
"Already we're preparing for the onslaught ," says 
Spencer. 

In the early summer, the office organized a group 
of students to canvass the area looking for listings. 
The UCSD Public Relations Office helps by 
obtaining public service announcements on 
television and radio encouragi~g landlords to place 

listings at the Housing Office. Anyone listing at the 
office must be willing to rent to students, Spencer 
emphasizes. 

Area by area, just how is the outlook for obtaining 
affordable student housing? 

The easiest area to obtain housing in is not too far 
away. Landlords in the Eastgate Mall and the 
Genessee Highlands area, about two miles east of 
campus, seem to have grown used to the idea of 
renting to students. These areas have a high density 
of students, and the rents are not in the 
stratosphere. However, many students who have 
lived in the Genessee Highlands condominiums say 
that the low price are due to the poor construction 
of the units . 

Moving east or south of La Jola, housing price 
decline as pro pective renters soon learn. The 
cheapest student housing is therefore often found in 
Clairemont and Pacific Beach, although the savings 
are usually offset by increased transportation costs 
and commuting time. 

Moving north, one comes to Del Mar. Although a 
popular student area, Del Mar is a summer beach 
and racing resort, and the rental costs skyrocket in 
the summertime, forcing most students out. This 
causes a crunch when students return in the fall. 

To meet this demand, Del Mar realtors cooperate 
in establishing a master list of rentals avai lable. 
Alreadly, realtors are making waiting lists with 
students' names, and the prices they are willing to , 
pay for next fall's rentals. In August they begin the 
process of matching students with the listings.

in Brown search 
Recommends three names for 
Regents to the governor 

BY RICK DOWER 
Sacramento Correspondent 

In . a departure . from pa t policy, the UC Student Body 
PreSidents CounCIl and UC Student Lobby have decided to 
jump into the proce of helping choose three new regents for 
the univer ity. 

SBrC Chair Linda Sabo, since replaced by AS President 
Jule Bagneris, nt a letter to Gov. Jerry Brown Wednesday 

aying selection of name to fill the remaining three vacancies 
i a "top priority and of vital concern" to UC tudents. 

Brown is expected to annou nce his choice for the positions 
in the next few week . 

abo aid BPC, which i made up of student body 
pre idents and vice·pre. ident ~rom each UC campus, want 
the governor to make hiS ele tlOn based on five criteria. 

Tho e criteria on which regents appoi ntee should be judged 
according to SBrC are: experience and knowledge of higher 
education, demonstration of publice ervice, advocacy of 
ociall y re ponsible education policies, committment to 

maintaining and expanding acce sibilit y of higher education 
and demonstratinon of availability and responsibility to the 
people of the state. 
- SBPC is also pushing for Brown to appoint women and 

minoritie to the regent eats, considered one of the top 
political plums in the nation. 

Kri ·tin Stelck, co·director of the UC Student Lobby, SBPC's 
legi lative arm, aid the group decided to become directly 
involved in the selection for the first time becau e Brown's 
recent appointments have been too political. 

"These next three choice are crucial," Stelck aid. "They're 
going to affect the University' direction and student intere ts 
for the next decade." 

Stel k said SBPC plan to interview and review a list of 
possible candidate for the regents jobs and make their 
recommendation to the governor by next week. 

Front·runners on SBPC's list so far appear to be Yolo County 
Supervisor and San Franci co educator Bob Black and former 
UC Davi campu activi t and parapsychologist Stanley 
Krippner. 

In the pa t, SBPC's involvement with the regental 
appointment proce s has been limited to nominating three 
candidates for the one·year tudent regent po ition, which the 
Regents then vote on. 

Stelck said Gov. Brown is aware of strong student upport in 
his past gubernatorial contests, knows he 'll need continued 
student votes in hi s bid fort he US Senate next year, and hould 
choo e regents who would have student interests at least.

Juclr Grahn 
Thursday, June 4 

8:00 pm 

The poetry of Judy Grahn is an underground legend 
among women in this country. Grahn has fashioned 
language and the shapes of poetry into a feminist 
statement of what it means to be a woman, in this 
world, at this time. Extremely varied in form and 
emotional color but always rooted in everyday 

language and universal female experience, this poetry 
that people memorize and put to use, dance to, learn 
from and argue with, laugh and cry CNer and whisper 
to themselves in hard times, Her most recent book, 

The Work of. Common Wom."I, includes the work 
of all fIVe of her chapbooks: Edward the Dyke and 
Other POCIIII, The Common Woman, She Who, A 

WOIIIIn II Talking to DatIl and COliftOntltlonl with 
the DevIl In the Form of Lcwc. 

Judy Grahn is presently doing historical research in San 
Francisco while also being an editor, lecturer and poet. 

A reception will follow the reading.

Interroga. a prisoner held In a sensory deprivation cell_ 

CHECK II OUT 
AtI8nt1c City: When thiS tale of lost 

dreams and frustrations In the gambling 
nnecca of the AtlantIC seaboard ended, 
I realized that I had enjoyed It But I 
wasn't sure why. People do things for 
little dlscemable reason Scenes cut to 
and fro Without logical pattern. But, stili, 
It was nice. Directo< LOUIS Malle has 
constrUCted a meNle that IS at once a 
satire on the plastIC madness that IS 
AtlantiC City and a sympathetiC look 
into the dreams of the City'S inhabitants 
Susan Sarandon IS brtlliant, as alwiIYS, in 
her role as a )IOung woman who wants 
to become a professional card dealer 
and deal her VMy to Europe. Burt 
Lancaster IS equally fine as an old minor 
league thug playing out the string as a 
house servant to " bed-ridden old 
glamour queen. Whatever the reason, 
the movie is worth seeing. 

Ex~lbur: People may no<maily 
associate the swo<d Excalibur and 
Camelot with King Arthur and Lancelot 
(or, perhaps, with Richard Burton). Bu~ 
after they see thiS movie, they should 
automatICally think of Merlin, the 
magician and power behind the throne. 
NICol Williamson, as Merlin, is the touch 
that allow.; John Boonnan's film to rise 
above the crowd. Sure the special 
effects are nice, the battles realistic, the 
men handsome and valiant, the women 
beautiful - in other words, the 
Arthurian legend brought forth 
llecurately - but, without Merlin, this 
wouldn't be a potential classic. The 
sure test is in the latter stages of the 
stOlY, when Merlin is missing from the 
scene. Things really slow at that point 
But, thanks to Williamson's Merlin, who 
IS at turns mystical, frightening and 
IlUlnerable, this is a definite "don't 
miss" mO>'ie. 

Tas: Nastassia Klnski, as Tess of the 
D'Urbetvilles, is a woman who any 
decent man would gM: his soul for. 
With dark, expressive eyes and full 
mouth, she IS the soul of this mCNie, the 
reason it ultimately succeeds. Of 
course, Roman Polansl" - in a radical 
deporture from hiS usual type of mCNIe 
- does a fine job In bringing the 
Thomas Hardy nCNel of ICNe and 
hypocriSY to the screen. The rank 
InjUStICes of "'te 19th century England 
blend well with the bec)U!iful, enduring 
countryside. But If Klnsld dldn't exis~ 
Polanski would have had to Invent her. If 
the actress playtng Tess Isn 't someone 
the c1Udlence can c"re for, no one 
would Sit through this three· hour 
retelling of her travails at the hands of 
lustful, heartless men and an uncanng 
SOCiety. By all means see thiS, the best 
mOVIe 0( 1980 

IN8kcr Mo.-Itt: Bruce 8eresfo<d, 
who also directed "The Getting of 
Wisdom" and "My Brtiliant Career," has 
come up With a marvelous antiwar 
mollie thiS time But to label "Breaker 
MOrant" as just an anti-war mcwle IS like 
calling "Gone With The Wind" a story 
about the CIIIII War ThiS tale of three 
Australian Bushveldt Carblneers 
charged With war crimes In the Boer 
Wars IS much more than that It IS also" 
sensitive study of human emotions, of 
the brute political tides that sweep up 
three soldier.; "nd earned them down 
the River Sty><, as It were. Edward 
Woodw"rd, certainly one of the mO<e 
underrated talents around, heads the 
cast as "Breaker" Morant, the soldler-
poet: who is held most responsible fo< 
the "war crimes." 8e)IOnd the top-
ndch acting, the pacing by 8eresfo<d, 
as he switches the action back and forth 
between the war and the courts-martial 
trial, keeps building the tension up to 
the explosive conclusion. Everything -
the technical aspects, the scri~, the 
acting - comes together to make this 
the best mcwie of the year, so f(l'. 

OUClllrld: If)QU I ike Sean Connery, if 
)IOu like Westerns, if )QU like science 
fiction, you 'lI like "Outland." You see, 
this mcwie is blantant about being a 
Western set in space (on 10, a moon of 
Jupiter, to be precise). Connery, craggy 
and wonderful as usual, IS the federal 
marshal deterrntned to stop the 
mysterious deaths at a mi ntng 
operation. The bad guy, played by 
Peter Boyle, is so determined to stop 
him that he serds fo< some out-of-tnvvn 
gunslingers to blow him aw"y. 
Connery's character comes directly 
from the lonely, gutty, supremely 
determined cCMlbCly-ac:tors of the past, 
men like Gary Cooper and Alan Ladd. 
Only the accent has Changed, from flat 
midwestern America to rich Scottish. 
"CNtland" IS slick, suspenseful and 
exCiting. 

.. knlc .. .....,.ng Itock: One of the 
most exasparattng, mystifying and 
entert"lning movies to come down the 
rood In a while. Australian Peter Wet( 
("The Last W eM!" ) bc1sed hiS film on a 
true story about the dlsappe(l'ance of 
several school girls from a turn-of-the-
cerwry boarding school. seems all the 
girls went on a plcmc to thiS spooky 
place called H"nglng Rock. Some of 
them never came back. Wet( captures 
perfectly the slow pace of those diIYS. 
He also drarT1c)tlzes per!ectly the 
breakdC7'oNfl - of the people involved 
and of the institunon Itself' - that 
occurs after the dlsappec)rance. If )QU 
can get through thiS rather slCMI film. 
)IOu'li be rewarded.

'Woodstock Relived' better 
off locked in the past 

~hU' day. June4. !9B! 

J had enough trou bl. 
maintaining my gastric 
integrity when the film 
Woodstock first emerged ten 
years ago - something about 
the documentary concerning 
the famed rock festival had 
the after tasted of an odious 

hubris, all those hippies 
gathered together for no good 
purpose, catching a ride on 
the swells of a collective ego 
- but the floodgates finally 
gave way a couple of weeks 
ago when NBC opted to 
screen the film 

Rather than showing the 
film as it was (already 
noteworthy for its sense of 
self-congradulation), the 
powers that be at the 
network instead whittled it 
down into something safe 

and defused entitled 
Woodstock Relived. In their 
production, NBC managed to 
change Woodstock from an 
historical footnote where 
pleasant memories can be 
derived and gave it the 
substance of a daydream. 
Woodstock Relived became, 
literally, naught but the 
magic land of Oz. and we the 
audience, a gaggle of 
Dorothies stranded in a 
metaphysical Kansas of the 
sould. became suddenl y 
transported to a land where 
dreams come true and all 
endings are happy. 

NBC's purpose, I suppose, 
was to make the surfeit of 
long-hair, strange costumes, 
loud music, hints of nudity 
and free-love in the original 
motion picture somehow 
acceptable to the mainstream 
TV public by contriving a 
method that would "explain" 
the phenomena to an 
audience who might possibly 
still be bewildered by the fete 
ten years hence. The primary 
proof of this is their choice of 

hiring Beau Bridges to 
provide a running comment-
ary. 

Seated on a set equipped 
with a TV monitor, Bridges 
exuded the authoritarian 
calm of Walter Cronkite 
seeming to adjudicate over a 
political convention. Where 
the first version of Wood51ock 
trusted the editing and the 
sequence of scenes to form 
their own narrative -
perhaps they had a better 
sense of who their potential 
audience was - the NBC 
editors would often flash the 
beginning of a musical act as 
Bridges would fit the film 
into a strained metaphorical 
context, as evidenced by two 
principal scenes in which the 
wishful thinking interpreta-
tion of the event belies its 
own banality. 

In the first. Joe Cocker's 
head appears on t he screen as 
the first strains of "A Little 
Help From My Friends" are 
played while off to the side, 
looking mellowly certain of 
his line. Bridges waxes poetic 

~t: 'II 
on the spirit of mutual 
cooperation that di tinguis-
hed the fete, citing the music 
as proof positive of his thesis 
with t he words "When Joe 
Cocker began to sing. he told 
the world what Woodstock 
was all about." 

My response, and others as 
well, was a loud "oh come on 
now." not because Bridges 
analogy sounded stupid but 
because even a cursory 
examination of historical fact 
brings the whole notion of 

1<· 105 & Mann Theatres preserl 

what the counter-culture 
actually was into que tion.ln 
plain fact, "what Woodstock 
was all about" was a matter 
of too many people showing 
up for an event whose 
producers expected les 
dense crowds, an alarming 
strain on existing food. toilet, 
sleeping and medical 
capabilities. and the 
remarkably benign re ponse 
of surrounding townspeople .

Wood-
stock 
l:onlinucd frolll p:lj,(c Hi 
Army to alleviate the hazards 
of over crowding. And Cocker 
himself. being less than the 
spokesman for anyone. was a 
scheduled performer with 
only one US hit who had to 
play under the most unusual 
of circumstances . Wood -
stock, in other words, was an 
accident of circumstances, 
and the fact that the crowd 
was more or less peaceful 
was little else bu't a fortuitous 
fluke. The NBC folks , 
though, wanted an over·aIl 
structure in which to place 
the fair, a coherent "theme" 
with which to make the film 
airable, so they exercised 
their own kind of historical 
revisionism, a revisionism 
intended to give the illusion 
that VVoodstock can be 
understood in the most banal 
set of generalizations . 

More insidious than 
forcing the image of Cocker 
into a cheap glittering cliche 
was the way they represen-
ted Country Joe McDonald. If 
memory serves me correcty. 
McDonald and his group The 
Fish were the mo t straight-
forwardly political of all the 
Bay Area rock and roll bands , 
going beyond the then trendy 
politics of the anti was 
movement and involving 
themselves with many new-
left causes, including various 
benefit concerts for the Black 
Panthers, SDS and other 
militant groups who's 
rhetoric frequent ly called for 
a "revolution" of a usually 
unspecified sort. The 
sensibilities at NBC, though, 
were either afraid of the 
depth of McDonald's obvious 
activism or were just plain 
ignorant of it, and chose 
instead to reduce him, like 
Cocker to little more than 
evidence for a foregone 
conclusion . Completey 
snippng out McDonald 's 
"Fish Cheer" ("Give me an 
F," and so on, until everyone 
is deleriously yelling FUCK). 
McDonald is first s hown half-
way through his son~ "Feel 
Like I'm Fixin' To Die' on the 
set's TV monitor while 
Bridges, his eyes puppy-wide 
his voice dripping a honey-
toned sincerity, generalized 
about the turmoil of the 
period , mentioning the 
dissent over the Vietnam war 
as a demonstration of 
"thousands and thousands of 
young people who deeply 
loved America who had 
something to say about the 
quality of life in this country, 
not just for them, but for 
generations to come." Then 
almost as an afterthought. 
the rest of McDonald's tune 
is played uninterrupted . 

Other examples abound 
endlessly throughout the run 
of Woodstock Relived of the 
way the producers of the 
show sought to make the 
original film presentable: the 
excising of all nudity, the 
elimination of all strong 
language that formerly 
peppered the soundtrack, 
only a cursory depiction of 
the drug use and most 
galling, Bridges' insistence 
that VVoodstock was nothing 
more than "kids letting off 
steam." During a sequence of 
shots that show kids mud-
sliding after a heavy rain . 
Bridges literally sa id 
something to the effect that

Woodstock Relived 
continued (rom page 17 
they were engaging in "not 
quite good clean fun , but 
what 's the difference?" The 
festival sounds positively 
wholesome, all -American, 
like going on a weekend 
retreat or sending one's son 
off to Boyscout Camp. 

By implication, the 60s are 
made to sound wholesome 
and good clean fun, just a 
period of rowdy behavior no 
more deadly than a fraternity 
panty-raid. The implication, 
though, goes deeper, hinting 
that the Woodstock festival 
itself can be held up in the 
light of history as being the 
quintessence of what the 60s 
were "about." All the 

Prepare for: 

varigated strands that 
marked the cultural and 
political atmosphere of the 
decade had merged to a head 
at the festival and that each 
had found its fullest 
expression. 

This revisionist arrogance 
galls me to not end - the 
assumption being that 
Woodstock can be called 
representative of the 60s -
but the fault in this case must 
fall to the TV producers and 
not the original film-makers. 
The original Woodstock was, 
to its credit, a documentary of 
a specific event that did not 
attempt to generalize a world 
view. Even with the paucity 
of good music, the cretinous 

photography of the acts and 
the inane good·vibe banter of 
the concert goers, the original 
Woodstock is none·the-less an 
accurate, if obviously biased 
representat ion of the festival, 
treating the event as 
something in and of itself. 
within context, without any 
pretense of imposing an 
overall "meaning." Though 
the film has dated badly. one 
can still see it and retain a 
perspective that keeps ones 
sense of propriety in order: 
something along the ,lines of 
people recognizing the follies 
of unrepentent youth. 

Woodstock Relived, how-
ever, denies the original film

... presents Intramural Sports Shorts 
... the 1980 Empty Beer Can Awards 

The time is now T minus 4 and 
counting. Yes, Henrietta, only four 
days to go and another memorable, 
action-packed intramural year will 
have passed before our very eyes. 
And oh what a year it was! In an era 
of endless limitations where there is 
little room to be bigger and better, 
UCSD intramural athletes one-
upped themselves again with a 
massive turn-out at the 1M 
frontdoor and an even greater series 
of performances on the athletic 
field . 

Intramural Sports in '81 was the 
prototype of an amoeba. Swallowing 
up everything in its path. More 
sports, more leagues, more teams 
and, of course, more of you playing 
than ever before. The numbers start 
to stagger the imagination. But. 
halt , let us not bore you with 
statistics . 

Let's get down to the nitty 
gritty ... the day we've all been 
waiting for .. the 3rd annual Empty 
Beer Can Award ... in sinc Ie 
recognition of all that you have 
accomplished and unaccomplbhed

tell. We're glad you joined us in

years at UCSD. 

(Ed. note: just kidding, Harley. 
Congratulations on your early 
retirement from innertube 
waterpolo. But remember, when 
your career i over as a shyster 
lawyer in Ponca City, Oklahoma,

CHEERS ••• 
... are always in order for the hosts 

of good party ... and this year the 
Intramural Sports Program was 
lucky enough to be blessed with a 
corps of excellent partyers ... uh, I 
mean ... h08ts . The Un-magnificent 
Seven as they have come to be called 
have been the real backbone of our 
fine pl"Ogram for the past year. 
Always giving of their time, their 
ideas, and their concern for the 
added enjoyment Qf all 1M 
participants, these guys are more 
than deserving of your thanks. 
Better yet, if you enjoyed the 1M 
program this year, buy these guys a 
beer the next time you see them. 
Guaranteed, they won't turn you 
down. And by the way ... they all 
drink Bud too! 

The Un-Magnificent Seven are in 
order of senority: 

AND Y BERG, Muir Sen ior ... 
currently suffering from a terminal 
case of intramurals-on·the-brain. 
This year's All-Cal shortstop at the 
UC-Santa Barbara 1M Festival...is 
still trying to live that down. Best 

known for trying to walk through 
glass doors at parties. That's right, 
folks, he's still trying. 

LAWRENCE H. VANDEN 
BOS, Esq., Muir Senior ... he of 
the low IQ and the high jumping 
ability ... or is it the other way 
around. Star goalie of Flotsam & 
Jetsam waterpolo team, this year's 
1M Sandbagger Team of the 
Year .. .In case, you can't picture 
him, he was the fool in the bathrobe 
at Casino Night calling out Keno 
numbers. 

KEVIN DOUGLAS, Third 
Senior ... under-rated guard on this 
year's varsity basketball team ... a 
Freeman Williams look-a-
like ... Kevin could shoot and play 
defense just like Freeman ... a 
consummate ladies man, Kevin had 
the baddest ride on campus, 'cept it 
was always in the shop, man. 

JOHNNY COX, Third Senior 
... all-around athlete in basketball, 
tennis, and badminton , Mr. 
Personality could light up any room 
with his presence. Trouble is, he 
could shut it down just as quick ... as 
soon as his "Talk Dirty" cassette 
got turned on. 

DAN EBY, Revelle Senior ... 
all-around good guy who doubled ur 
as a swimming pool heating unit. 
Every time he enters the water the 
temperature goes up 10 degrees. 
Coined the popular campus activity 
of "sklifing," whatever the hell that 
is. Still drives his ugly red 
"Sklifmobile" around campus on 
weekends. The only one uglier is 
Douglas'. 

KEVIN GUNNING, Revelle 
Junior .. .former holder of Mr. 
Thunder Thighs title on campus. 
Big guy, very athletic, especially in 
volleyball, but for some reason has 
always wanted to be a piccolo 
player. 

TIM SULLIVAN, Muir 
Junior ... Sharp guy ... holds his 
liquor real well too. Godfather of 
that motley group on campus 
known as the Cunning Linguists, a 
perrenial Avis-type team ... except 
this year when they ran off with the 
Hawaiian Football title. Oh well, 
even a blind squirrel finds an acorn 
once in a while. 

In reality, however, the thank you 
list should not end there. So many 
others have made a positive impact 
on IMs at UCSD that it would be 
impossible to name all of them, but 
let's try anyway. 

To start with there's computer 
whizzes Marc Bernard and Steve 
Young, and then 1M Secretary oft he 
Year, Diane DuPlessis. After that, 
we've got the hardest-working 
group of referees and officials ever, 
led by three-time All-American Jon 
Mooney, Bob Gerlach, John Allen, 
Fred Blesch, Jon Lindo, the Bros. 
Liotta and all of the others. All have 
done much to make IMs just that 
much better at good 01' UC. 

For all of those who are leaving 
campus, the Budman wishes you 
much luck and a tip of the A-B cap 
for all of your contributions. For 
those of you who return, come back 
and see ue. We'll be right here! Have 
a great summer!
