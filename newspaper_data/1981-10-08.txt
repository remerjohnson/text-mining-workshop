Little babies and 
Reagan budget ell ts 

No on e enjoys hearing 
stories about the poor people 
who will be left unprotected by 
the president's "safety net ." 
Like most people, we'd prefer 
to worry about the upcoming 
World Series as the Presi· 
den t's federal budget cuts take 
hold. 

We 'd like to believe the 
president's cuts in social 
programs won't harm "the 
truly needy." After all, Ronald 
Reagan is a nice guy. He 
wouldn't do anything to hurt 
anyone - especially babies. 

But that's not qUIte 
accurate. Pre sured to shrink 
federal spending further, the 
president's pencil-wielding 
budget -cutters want to s las h a 
program that holds down the 
nation's infant mortality rate 
and reduces the number of 
neurological birth defects each 
year . 

Better known as WIC , the 
Women. Infants and Children 
Supplemental Feeding 
Program helps improve the 
health of malnourished 
pregnant women and their 
babies. It' s a welfare program 
that' worked. 

During the early 1970 " 
medical researcher s di -
covered that malnouri ' hed 
pregnant women were more 
likely to bear ·t illborn or "low-
weight " babie ' than were 
their healthier counterparts. 
Moreover. researchers found 
that underweight babies 
frequently suffered from a 
series of diseases that s tunt 
physical and mental develop-
ment. 

After several doctor from 
St. Jude's Ho s pital in 
Memphis, Tenn. , took this 
evidence to the late Sen. 
Hubert H. Humphrey (0 -
Minn .) in 1972. Congre s 
initiated a pilot program, 
giving poo r , underweight 
mother s vo u c her s for 
nutritional food s. Slowly , 
health clinics began issuing 
cred its for cheese, orange juice 
and iron-fortified cereals to 
women who qualified . 
Nutrition classes were also 
provided . 

Over the years, WIC' s 
results have been impressive. 
Infant mortality has dropped 
among babie born to mom ' 
who've been on the program. 
Low-weight babies, supported 
indirectly by WIC, have also 
been returned to their proper 
weight. Wit h such overwhelm-
ing evidence on record , 
Republicans and Democrats 
have concluded that WIC is 
possibly the government 's 
most cost -effective socia l 
program. 

"Mothers come into my 
clinic all the time with big 

s miles on their faces," said 
Diane Dimperio, who directs a 
WIC program at a health clinic 
in Gainesville, Fla. "They tell 
me how t heir babies are in 
s uch good health thank to 
WIC ." 

But fewer of Diane 
Dimperio 's patients are 
s miling these days. She claims 
several of her undernourished 
patients aren 't even coming in 
for their regular checkup. 
They've heard about President 
Reagan 's cu t backs and 
suspect WIC won't be much 
help in t he future. 

Last spring, President 
Reagan proposed a 30 percent 
reduction in the WIC budget, 
from $1 billion to $720 million. 
Yet , the Senate Budget 
Committee rejected the 
pres ident 's propo al over-
whelmingly . Even such 
conservatives as committee 
Chairman Pete Dominici (R-
N .M.) and Bob Dole -R-Kan.} 
said " no" to the president, and 
Congress retained the full 
program. 

Neverthele ,as part of a 
second round of budget cuts, 
some sources at the Agricul· 
ture Department expect the 
administration to request new 
WIC cuts, ranging from 15 to 
40 percent. 

In human terms, as many a 
800.000 low-income women , 
infants and children could be 
denied minimum nutrition. 

Though Congress has n't 
given up on WIC , potential 
cuts are already having an 
effect on the program. Besides 
frightening away clients , 
rumors of WIC's demise have 
led many state health 
directors to withhold funds 
aut horized last year. " Many 
state directors don't want to be 
caught in a position of 
s pending over their budget, " 
an Agriculture Department 
official told us . 

While Republicans ana 
Democrat s in Congress 
struggle to save WIC, the 
White Hou se has threatened to 
veto any legislation that 
exceeds the president's budget 
guidelines . A s shadow 
president Edwin Meese told 
the California Savings and 
Loan League last week, "We're 
not going to swerve from the 
course of economic recovery 
for political or any ot her 
reasons. We will take the 
necessary actions , no matter 
how unpopular they may be in 
the short run." 

We understand the need for 
fiscal responsibility . But 
shou ld we ask babies to bear 
any sacrifice? The next time 
someone says the pre 'ident' s 
budget cu ts won ' t hurt t he 
"truly needy," tell them about 
WIC .

A Different Angle 

Pretty as a picture 
BY LYNETTE TOM 

There was a definite October chill in the air 
that afternoon as I made my way through the 
breakwater of broken concrete s labs lining the 
beach. [ snuggled further in my ski jacket, 
grateful for its warmth and protection from the 
occasional blasts of wind I hal left a healthy 
pink tinge to my otherwise brown cheeck . and 
made a proverbial mop of my hair. 

Never quite getting u ed to the constant 
'hifts in footing upon the sand , I walked a path 
more or less parallel to t he shore. Now and then, 
I would pull out my antiquated rangefinder and 
snap a couple of shots. I reached the lifeguard 
station, halfway through the roll, and was 
about to turn around and go back when I saw 
him. 

He was about s ix feet tall, plus or minus a few 
inches, and of s light build. His age ranged 
somewhere between late twenties to early 
thirties. Dark brown hair touched the collar of 
his plaid flannel shirt and a beard of the same 
color covered his face. His hand were hidden 
ins ide the front pockets of faded jeans that 
ended in Nike-c1ad feet. Eyes of calm gray stared 
at me with a congenial glow. We were the only 
two people on the beach. 

" Hello," he said . 
"Hello. " 
"Nice day." 
"I can't complain. " I said. 
"Nice camera . You don ' t see too many of 

those old models around anymore." 
"It's not bad . Except there's no light meter or 

automat ic focus sell ings. So, I have to do a lot of 
ex peri men ts." 

"How long have you been taking pictures?" 
he asked. 

"How long have you been watching me?" 
"That long, huh?" 
"Just with this particular camera. Mydad got 

tired of me always borrowing his. This was his 
fi rst one." 

We started walking. 
"Do you live in the area?" I asked him. 
"No, I'm jus t passing by. My second time 

around here. As for home, you might say it's at a 
very high altitude. And you?" 

" Native born. for twenty-one yea rs . ,. 
"A student." 
I nodded . 
"Senior at UCSD." 
" Is this for a class?" he as ked , ges turing to 

m y camera. 
I shook my head. 
"School newspaper." 
" You're a s taff photographer?" 
" A writer. But, the editor needed a feature 

photo for the front page and all the 
photographers were busy on assignment. " 

" Why the beach?" 
I shrugged. 
" It 's kind of ironic. I've never cared for the 

beach . I've always liked the mountains more." 
"So go there instead." 
'" would , but I don 't have a cr . I don 't even 

have a license, which is almost unheard of in 
here. Sometimes, I feel like I don't belongtothi s 
world." 

"There's nothing wrong about that." he said 
softl y. 

"Sure. If you're a hermit. " 
The man jus t sm iled . We continued walking. 
"What kind of work do you do ?" I asked. 

" Well , I used to be a carpenter. But, I had to 
give it up." 

" I don t blame you, the way things are 
with high interest rates on home loans. 0 
what are you doin~ now?" 

''I'm a mini ter. ' 
"Oh." 
"Sounds like you disapprove." 
"No. it 's not that...aren't you kindofyoungto 

be a pries t?" 
"It was an early calling." he explained. "I 

remember when I was twelve, I was alreadr, 
discussing theology with the church teachers. ' 

" How long have you been preaching?" 
"Three years ." 
"At which church?" 
" I take a more informal approach . [ come to 

the people, like a missionary." 
" I always thought missionaries only went 

abroad." 
"Mo·t do. But. sometimes the hardest people 

to reach are those who live right in your home 
town. " 

He stopped s uddenly . his eyes fixated on the 
horizon. 

" What 's wrong?" I asked , alarmed. 
"There 's your feature photo," he said, 

pointing toward the ocean . 
It was the kind of sunset you see used as a 

movie backdrop for those old mus hy love 
stories. Only this was the real thing. The sutr 
was a perfect orange dis k agains t a rose sky and 
above a violet sea with a band of shimmering 
gold where the s un cast its reflection. 

" Better take it now before it's too late," 
warned the man. 

''I'd love to, but I can't ." 
"Why not?" 
"The film in my camera isn't fast enough. 

And r don ' t have a flash ." 
"Take it anyway," 
" But it 's too dark," I protested. "You won't 

even see the su n. " 
"The sun will be there. Trust me." 
Something in his voice told me that I should 

believe him . I took out my camera, set it to the 
widest apeture , and s hot two pictures. I turned 
to face the man . My eyes met an empty beach. 
He was gone. 

• [ flipped on the light switch of the darkroom 
and was blinded by the sudden change from red 
safelights to white f1ourescent s . After a 
moment , [ was able to focu s my eyes on the fixer 
tray filled with prints. With tongs in hand, I 
transferred the photos to the washer tray, 
skimming over most of them until' came to the 
last one. 

The man was right: the sunset was 
there ... and it had been a ltered . The sun 's 
reflect ion on t he water was no longer a straight 
band, but a cross. And while I s tood there, 
gaping at the transformation, I was reminded of 
a story I had read in some book as a child . It was 
about a man who loved his fellow man so much 
that he sacrificed his life to save the world. In 
the end , hecame back from the dead and told his 
followers that he wou ld have to leave them now, 
but he promised that he wou ld come back

'Rock of Ages' author answers critics 
Editor: 

I wou ld like to thank Barry 
Clayton for his letter (UCSD 
Guardian, Oct. 1) concerning 
my article "The Age of Rock ' 
and the Rock of Ages." It i ' a 
"perfect" demonstration of my 
principal point ·: not every· 
thing believed by 'cientists is 
necess arily 'cience, creation-
ism is not science. creat ionis ts 
are either extremely confused 
or ext remely di si ngenuous 
about the relationships 
between science and religion 
mo ·t generally ,md between 
science and fundamenta lis t 
Christianity in particular. 

Why does Barry Clayton 
make s purious and non -
sequitorial references to the 
Second Law of Thermodyna-
mics? [n the s trictes t sense, 
th e law applies only to the 
co n vers ion of h ea t int o 
mechanical energy. In that 
sense, it is relevant to the 
chemi s try a nd ph ys ics of 

physiology but has nothing to 
say one way or another about 
evolution. Taken in a more 
metaphorical sen e, what that 
law has to say about biology is 
that life is a "miracle" or sorts 
in that it constantly breaks the 
law. That i to say, organisms 
co ns tantly tran s form the 
relatively probable into the 
highly improbable ; green 
plant s transfo;-m s imple 
elements into carbohydrates 
and animal s transform 
relativel y s imple carbohy -
drates into highly complicated 
protein s. On a global sca le , 
this d . increa 'e the entropy 
of the environment , but on the 
global scale, the kindly old s un 
keeps on sending down new 
packets of energy , so, in 
principl , t here is no need to 
get too excited about it.

Creation science res-embles Aryan • SCIence 
Editor: 

I have followed the recent 
"Creation versus Evolution" 
debate in this paper and would 
like to add my own comments. 

It seems that what the 
Creationists want i ' an 
affirmative action program for 
their "scientific" theorie . By 
their reasoning, the views of 
Velikovsky, Von Daniken. and 
other "scientific" thinkers 
should be given "equal time" 
in science classrooms. The 
Creationists demand for equal 
time might seem reasonable, 
until one stops and thinks: 
equal time for the views of an 
undistinguished minority of 
the scientific community, who 
have a patently religious 
grudile against the prevailing 
view( Equal time for "Worlds 
in Collision" and "Chariots of 
the Gods"? The time these 
"theories" get outside the

adequate. 
I refer to Creationism as the 

New Aryan Science because 
like Aryan Science , the 
"science" of Nazi Germany, it 
is "science" in the name of a 
political. social. and cultural 
movement, namely the so· 
called New Christian Right. It 
i' not motivated by a truthful 
search for answers to 
questions about the natural 
world. It is motivated by a 
desire to break the natural 
world into a particular mold, 
namely that of Fundamen: 
talist Christianity. Nature, 
however, is not constrained to 
follow the world view of any 
part icular religious or political 
group. The Nazis discovered 
that "Jewish Science" 
(Relativity and Quantum 
Mechanics) was necessary to 
understand nuclear physics; 
too late, fortunately , to develop 
atomic weapons. 

I suppose that referring to 
Creationism as the New Aryan 
Science is excessively harsh, 
but I believe the comparison is 
instructive. I do not wish to 
imply that the New Christian 
Right is neo-fascist. although 
there have been by now 
numerous instances of book 
burnings and threats to 
teachers and publishers. I do 
not wish to imply that the New 
Christian Right is neo-fascist , 
although the head of theMoral 
Majority in New York said 
that "Jews have a superna-
tural ability to make money." I 
do not care if Jerry Falwell 
disavowed t his last statement, 
because Jerry Falwell is not 
the New Christian Right. 
Behind the benevolent smile of 
the Reverend Falwell , in the 
rank and file of the New 
Christian Right , lurks a mean-
spirited ugliness and vile, 
narrow minded religious 

bigotry that poses as a great a 
threat to the future of this 
country as any pornographic 
excess. 

The sad fact of the matter is 
that the New Christian Right 
is looking for scapegoats for 
thi country's apparent 
decline. Evolution seems to be 
a convenient target. According 
to the New Christian Right, 
evolution reduces man to an 
animal. lies behind Nazism, 
Communism, Socialism , 
pornography , child abuse, 
incest, teen-age pregnancy, the 
venereal disease epidemic, and 
a host of ot her problems, no 
dou bt including high interest 
rates. However, even if this 
were true, it would have 
absolutely no bearing on the 
validity of evolution as a 
scientific theory. It was 
certainly unfortunate that 
Nazi death campus existed, 
and that millions perished in 

them, but it was the lunatic 
ravings of Quasi-religious 
fanatics, not evolution, that 
really justified them. Besides, 
was evolution connected with 
the slave trade, or the witch 
hunt and religious wars of 
Europe? Of course not. Yet 
millions died in the course of 
these event s. 

If the New Christian Right 
is looking for scapegoats, I can 
suggest much more logical 
ones. They could blame the 
'dentists who developed the 
birth control pill. This 
undoubtedly has had a major 
effect on t he behavior of people 
today. They could blame the 
scientists who developed 
nuclear weapons. The thought 
of nuclear war is at least in the 
back of everyone's mind, and 
perhaps this has affected 
human attitudes towards life. 
They could blame some racial

Anorexia nervosa: obsession with 'thin' 

" ' ''" • f 1);1 J..!t I 
organizational meeting was 
held Wednesday to decide 
what time the group will meet 
regularly. Those interested 
can contact Levins at x3987. 

In the past , the group has 
included about eight women 
with anorexia or bulemia, or 
who know of others affected on 
campus . The number of 
anorexics and bulemics at 
UCSD is unknown, said 
Levins, but those eight women 
"can go to the cafeteria and 
spot them." 

According to Dr. Z. Kripke 
at the Student Health Center, 
many cases of bulemia are 
reported by co ncerned 
roommates who have noticed a 

friend's unusual behavior and 
have heard the vomiting_ 
Kripke said that about 10 
women with anorexia or 
bulemia have voluntarily come 
to the Health Center for help 
each year. 

Although most are women. 
some anorexics and bulemics 
are men who often are ballet 
dancers, wrestlers, jockeys 
and others who must keep 
t heir weight down. 

"I have known of men , but I 
haven 't seen them," said 
Levins, "it's just not talked 
about. " 

One rea son for the 
overwhelming proportion of 
women, said Levin s. i that 
"u ntil recently. men were not 

looked upon as sex objects." A 
man's power had traditionally 
been measured in terms of his 
int elligence and professional 
success, whereas a woman's 
power has been more intensely 
related to sex appeal , s he said . 

Many anorexic s and 
bulemics are women who have 
"bought the femin ine ideal in 
our society to be slim," said 
Levins. She questions whether 
the California beach scene has 
made women in this area even 
more body conscious . 

Although they may already 
be slim, many of the afflicted 
women have a distorted image 
of their ·bodies. They perceive 
themselves as fat and ugly 
when they' re really not. said 

Levins. And this negative body 
image often contributes to 
other problems they may have 
relating to their sexual ity . 

Another common trait 
among anorexics and bulemics 
is that they often are 
perfectionists who constantly 
strive to impress others, 
especially parents. And like 
most people, these women are 
hungry for success and fearful 
of rejection. 

Eating disorders have often 
been linked to sex ual 
repression , but many 
psychologists now think that 
anorexia and bulemia mav be 
rooted in this fear of rejeciion . 
Food become · a temporary 
!'olut ion to pr ssing problems 
for bulemlcs. Rather than 
tackling a J.lroblem head on . a

and then purge .... the food by 
\omiting or taking an 
overdosage of diuretics or 
laxatives. 

Although an anorexic 
ometime starve herself to 

death, a bulemic woman puts 
more daily wear-and-tear on 
her body. said Kripke of the 
Health Center. An anorexic 
may stop menstruating, or she 
may !,tart losrng her hair . but 
she does not suffer the effect~

presence of stomach acid in the 
mouth. 

Those who use overdosages 
of diureti cs or laxat ives 
instead of vom iting can also 
suffer problems related to this 
practice. 

Long term effects have yet to 
be seen, although the history 
of anorexia and bulemia may 
go back for centuries. Only in 
the past fey.' year have t hese 
disease been brought to the 
public's attention . 

Now there is a "coming out 
of the closet," said Levins who 
has worked with the women's 
discussion group since its 
inception I hree years ago. 

Women in the group openly

UC libraries install computerized catalog 
BY LAEL HANERFELD 
In an age of advancing 

computer technology, it is not 
urprising that UCSD ha ' 

installed Meh )'1, a computer-
ized card catalog covering all 
UC librarie ·. There are 15 
terminals at UCSD libraries, 
seven of which are at Cluster 
Undergraduate Library. 

Melvyl, officially calJed the 
UC Prototype On · Line 
Catalog, contain ubject and 
author, title entrie ' for books 
cataloged before Dec. 31, 1980 
in the UC librarie ·. Becau e it 
is in an experimental ·tage, it 
is not yet complete. Melvyl 
contain most volumes of the 
Cluster and Science and 
Engineering Libraries and 
varying percentage ' of other 
UCSD and UC librarie . For 
example, t here are on ly 
181.000 of UC Berkeley's 5.7 
million volume collect ion on 
record on Melvyl at UCSD. For 
most purposes, Melvyl can be 
used in place of a card catalog. 

One of Melv yl's best 
features is that it is not 
necessary to be a computer

major to use it. It I~ relat i\'ely 
simple to operate. There are 
two modes: the look·up mode 
and I he command mode. [n I he 
look-up mode Melvyl give: 
complete instructions and the 
user makes choices or supplies 
information. The command 
mod e is a lit t le more 
sop hi st icated. The Ul'er 
manipulates the computer's 
language and in the command 
mode can take advantage of all 
Melvy J' s capabili ties. At any 
time in either mode typing 
HELP will give the u 'er 
instruct ions. 

Mark Gittel so hn , head 
librarian at Clusrer, thinks 
that Melvyl h as man y 
advantages to the standard 
card cata log. Mel vy l wi ll 
enha nce, he says, the use of 
library materials and give the 
users more way ' of access 
towards them. For example, 
Melvyl can find titles when 
given any word in the title, and 
display them. [t can in the 
same manner find books by a 
subject search. Because broad 

s ubj ~c t s may contain 

thousand. of books, it is 
possible to limit the search by 
libraries. year~. and other 
categories. Melvyl can also 
combine and displa y subj ct 
heading '. When searching for 
a book using the author , 
Melv yl wi ll display a 
bibliography. 

Gittelsoh n says that this 
stage of Melvyl is just a 
primary one; t he possibilities 
are endless. If Melvy l leaves 
the experimental s tate 
successfully, the next s tep will 
be to add all entries in the 
UCSD libraries since Jan. I, 
1981, and ultimately hold all 
entries at all UC libraries. 

Pre 'ently all terminals are 
hard wired to Berkeley, yet in 
the near future a microwave 
link will a llow expansion of 
the number of terminals and 
ideall y allow them to be 
situated anywhere. Another 
poss ibility is that they could 
eventually give print outs and 
put books on hold at ot her 
UC's Gittelsohn sees a 
completely automated library 
in the far future.

more books than you care to remember. The 
work is done. The papers are in, So now

There arc s('vera l rea~on s 
for thl" ' hange to a 
com puteri zed card catalog. It 
is expen~ively difficult , as 
Git\el!whn exp lains, t o 
manually change card catalogs 
especially s ince a new code of 
cataloging rules was adopted 
in the US early in 1981. As it 
happen ed, t he On -Line 
Catalog was being developed 
at the same time. Melvyl can 
change it · file s on an 
authorized command. Anot her 
disadvantage of a card catalog 
is that it' s stationary. It can 
only be in one place and cannot 
relisticall y hold files from 
different li braries. Although 
Mark isn't sure how much 
Melvyl is costing the UC 
system, he i · sure that it s 
advantage ' are invaluable. 

There ar st ill plusses for 
the card catalog and problems 
with Melvy l. Melvyl is 
experiencing communication 
problems in testing. While 
additions and changes are 
beint' mad e, the lin es 
temporarily go down. This 
happens infrequently during 

the eight to live work w ek . 
Th re are also user prublems. 
Often a user will become 
impat ient while wait ing for 
Melvy l to respond , forgett ing 
how long the search would 
take himself. Pres.- ing certain 
buttons while awaiting a 
response will stop I he search. 
Another problem i ' when the 
user doesn't limit a long 
search. A lime to use the old 
card catalog system would be 
when it is difficult to narrow a 
subject search. Also, w hen 
Melvyl doesn't show records of 
a certain book, there is a 
chance t hat its records are not 
yet in the computer, so checle 
the card catalog. 

Git te l 'ohn doesn't think 
people wi ll be afraid to u 'e 
Melvyl. It is a case of the 
famili ar versus the new. 
Melvyl has much to offer , so 
give it a chance. Next time you 
happen to find yourself in a 
library, learn to u 'e Melvy I. It 
cap only be 10 your advantage, 
because you can always resort 
to the card catalog.

or religious minority, although 
this is currently out of fashion. 

As far as I he scienti fic 
validity of Creationism is 
concerned, the blunt truth is 
that it ha s none. Th e 
Creationis ts are reduced to 
misquotes and fabr ication in 
order to back up their theories. 
For instance, one of their 
fa vori te "facts" is that the 
lunar dust layer is only 4 
inches thick, and that this 
somehow implies a young 
moon (less than ten thousand 
years old). Act ually, on the 
Apollo mis ions, core samples 
of the lunar soil that were 
sev eral feet long were 
obtained. There was nothing 
special about the outer four 
inches, either. Therefore, I am 
forced to conclude that the 
Creat ioni s t s a re plainly 
di s ho nest here . Another 

scientific argument that the 
Creationists use is that the 
Earth 's magnetic field is 
decaying in a way that implies 
that the Earth is less t han ten 
thousand years old. Their 
assu mption is that the original 
magnet ic field of the Earth 
cou ld not have exceeded some 
value, and that it has been 
monotonica II y decreasing 
s ince creation. This com· 
pletely ignores t he fact that 
the Earth's magnetic field has 
reversed in the past and will 
undoubtedly do so in the 
future . It has been known for 
some time that the Earth's 
magnetic field behaves like 
this. The Creationists 
evidently cho e to ignore this 
fact.

For years , scientists have looked for

In a paper submitted to the

author~ believe that ma!>ers - intense 
sources of radio waves (microwaves) 
emanating from molecules tuck to the 
surface of dust grains that are heated 
by shock waves in molecular cloud -
may be stars that either dIdn't qu Ite 
make it or are in the early st ages of 
formation , 

"Masf'rs are ext remelv effiCIent, 
energellc radIO sources. they appear to 
emIt energy from material compressed 
by gravity. perhaps with an assIst 
from radiation, but they may have too 
little ma,; ' to actuallv become a star," 
, and ford says . "lnsiead they become 
masers and radiate away much of their 
excess energy." 

The Berkeley and Los Alamo 
numerical calculations that give ri e to 
these new results were compared with 
recent data in the astronomical 
Itteralure from the ocorro Very Large 
Array, The calculations are causmg 
quite a stIr in astrophysics circle, a ' 
new predictions that are based on more 
than 'peculation are apt to do, 

"We are !t,'mgon a planetutained 
by a second-generation, low-ma "star. 
surrounded by untold billions of till 
others. and yet we have verv little 
information about how 'uch stars are 
actually formed. In a en e. we are all 
seeking our cosmic root . 

"In the 19508, E,A. Dibai, a Russian 
ast rophysicist, recognized the 
importance of radiation to the tar 
formation process, but unt il the advent 
of 'ophi ticated facilitle like the VLA, 
and upercomputers. such a. we have 
acce ". to at Los Alamos, it wa not 
possible to probe beyond the vi 'ion of 
optical telescopes and collect ufficient

The fan: all shapes, all 
sizes - and al'Ways there 

BY BOB MCSPADDEN 
Spurt"'i EdifOl-

The lat.e Jack Murphy once 
said, "There is nothing 
sweeter to th club's owner 
than t he musIc of a happy 
crowd." uch would also be 
appropriale for the coach. the 
team , and ves, the fan himself. 

The average fan is not ,m 
easy p rson 10 stereotype. I've 
been to Padre games where th 
t\\'o people on my right \\ ercan 
eight y year old grandfather 
wil h his se\'en year old 
grandson. However, there ar 
some very distinctive 
groupings of I he run of the mill 
"fan. " 

Take, for ins tance , the 
person who roots for whoever 
is winning the game. At the 
U C \ 'S. Notre·Dame foot ball 
game last year. J happened ro 
get a place by an ob ious Iri sh 
follower. The green covering 
his body was so bright that he 
instantly became the favorite 
of the T .V. cameras. However, 
a ' the game progre ' 'ed and 

the Irish fell further and 
further into void, the man 
'i lowly changed his opinion of 
" hi s" team , After halftime. he 
ca me back to hi~ seat with a 
I arge beer. weanng an SC cap, 

Then t here is I he person 
who blames everything that 
happens on t he referee: Fan: 
"Why don't you get some 
gla,>sc'" you blind old bat?" It 
never fails. if hiS team is 
behind It 's alwm s because the 
ref did a crummy job of calling 
Ihe game. Not crummy on both 
sides of the field, just on hi '. 
However. when the ref makes 
a bad call but it goes in the 
favor of his team , you're likely 
to hear, "Good call , That's the 
way!" 

Fan number three is the 
loyal fan. Thi ' per 'on 'hows 
up at every game no matter 
what 'hape he or the team is 
in. Most of the crowd at Padre 
games this year consi ,ted of 
the "loyal Fan." 

We now come to one of the 
mo t popu lar fan ,the heckler. 

It rcall} doesn't mat ter 111 Ihis 
case whose !-.ide t he edge is on, 
just as long as I here i.., 
somet hing to yell about , A fe\\ 
cold beers will u..,ually PUI the 
heckler into the mood to 
heckle, and he never leavl''' a 
game before it I" 0\ cr, \ 
common commenl from this 
guy is, "Comcon. you ",O.B, ·, . 
'iho\\ thos guy" YOli aren't a 
bunch of ., ..... and kICk the · . 
out of 'em." No dou bl vou \e 
run in to a few of these guv ... 
before, 

Perhaps the fa n that people 
don't really think of too often 
is the parent of a boy or girl 
who i: playing, This fan can 
fall into an y of the former 
classes, He can be the quiet 
bystander who congratulat es 
the coach after the game, He 
can be the loudest person in 
the stands, e,~, "That 's my 
boy out t here.' Or, he can be 
the person who drags all of his 
friends and neighbors to 
watch hi , kid play,

Tokyo Quartet here 
B~' GORDON 1I0WAI-W 

The internationally 
renowned Tokyo String 
Quartet, acclaimed as oneof 
the be ·t chamber groups in 
the world. will perform this 
Saturday , at 8 p.m. in the 
Mandeville Auditorium. 

The quartet was formed 
attheJulliard School of New 
York in 1969, and s incethen 
has toured extensively, won 
pres tigiou s international 
competitions, and ri 'en to 
the heights of the s tring 
quartet world. The program 
for t his Saturday includes 
Mozart 's Quartet No. 21 in 
o Major . Schubert 's 
Quartet in D Minor. No. 14, 
and " A way a lone," a piece 
co mposed by japanes e 
composer Toru Takemitsu 
and premiered by the 
quartet earlier this year at 

New York's Carnegie Hall. 
Tickets are available at 

The Turntable, located at 
7852 Girard in La jolla for 
an astronomical $15 . 
However beginning an hour 
before the performance. 
unsold tickets will be 
available at the door to 
students at $7. which is still 
a small fortune on a normal 
student budgeLI t is obvious 
that the La Jolla Chamber 
Music Society, sponsors of 
t his performance. is not 
aimi ng its program towards 
a s tud e nt c li e ntele . 
Huwever $7 is not outra-
geous. co n s idering the 
world-class reputat ion of 
the Tokyo Quartet, and also 
in compari son to what 
people pay to see a mediocre 
rock group at the acoustical-
ly atrocious Sports Arena.

Atol11icafe 
turns in 
fine show 

BY TIM AU(; ST 
Stu!! Writer 

Tuesday night's Atomicafe 
co ncert pro ve d to b e 
everything it was suppo ed to 
be and a bit more. The 
fantastic divergence of 
material seen and heard made 
for an evening of ec lect ic 
surprises. 

A capacity crowd also added 
to the evening's program. One 
hundred plus people filled the 
Mandeville Recital Hall and 
seemed to receive the program 
quite well. Comments by 
attendees ranged from the 
undecisive, "I can't explain it" 
to the nebulous. "it seemed to 
be an experimental kind of 
ambiguous airing out of ideas 
rather than a presentation or 
performance. " 

concerts 
This year's director Rick 

Boulanger thought that the 
performance "went really 
well" and was pleased that the 
attendance was so good. [n 
fact, Boulanger believes that 
this concert represented l he 
best turnout for a season 
opening Atomicafe concert . 

The great range of style' 
presented allowed for an 
impre ss ive and often 
challengi ng atmosphere; one 
that ultimately resulted in a 
generally auspicious event. 

The first piece. Woodwind 
Quintet il1 Fmajor represented 
a new direction for composer 
Nicholas Verin. His work in 
t he past has been self-
described as " more abrasive" 
with his roots being more in 
the rock genre rat her than 
contemporary mu ic. 

The performance Quintet 
consisted of a score written for 
flute, oboe, clarinet . french 
horn, and bassoon; that was 
approximated on a digital!

Cheap thrills on Saturday night 
BY MIKEL TOOMBS 

The action commences in a 
strange, nightmari s h , low-
budget world, inhabited by 
1970s people driving 1940s 
cars. A young couple. soon to 
be newlyweds (or so they 
think), motors into a cemetery 
and proceeds to fool around. A 
disapproving vampire ri ses 
from his crypt and impales the 
boy on a tombstone. t hen hauls 
the girl off to an empty grave 
and rapes her, adding insult to 
injury by draining off some of 
her blood . 

Things go from bad to 
worse. The girl - billed in the 
credits as "The Unwi lling 
Mother" - has the vampire's 
'on (shades of Rosemary's 
Baby). which she boll Ie-feeds 
with her own blood (shades of 
Uttle hop 0/ Horrors) . The kid 
grows to manhood - and to be 
portrayed by the rei ntless ly 
inert William (hllllL"io ll of the 
Bee Girls) mith - oooessc'(\ 
with finding and destroying 
his fathcr . Dad turns up to 
leach a l niversity Extension 
night class on the occult. 

It '~ ;,t tll l'ven more downhi ll 
from ther '. what with acouple 
of gri"ly murdcrs (thc VIctim" 

include a librarian who 
refuses to let the vampire 
check out a book), a shower 
sce ne which won't make 
anyone forget Psycho, an 
obligatory seance and one of 
those cop-out "The End - Or 
[s It?" finishes . 

Vampire/rom the Grave was 
an appropriately horrible 
choice to kick off Channel 
Nine' s new "Murder Ma-
cabre" series (Saturday nights 

television 
at 8 p . m . and Sunday 
afternoon s at 4 p.m.). " Mov ie 
Maca bre" is the lat est in a fin e 
Sout hern California tradition 
of cheap crea ture features . and 
is hos ted by a n impos ing 
young lad y dubb d '·Elvira." 
(Her nam is d rived, rather 
unimaginatively, from thal of 
'50 L.A. scenemaker Vampira. 
who appeared in the 
wonderfully imcompetent film 
Pia II /I/(' fro l/l (Juler Spare 
along v.ith a half-dead Bel<l 
I.ugosi .) 

I~h ir<l and " Mm'lt' Ma · 

cabre" are fo\lowing in the 
groundbreaking wake of 
Channel Ten's "Moona Lisa" 
Clark and the late great Larry 
"Seymour" Vincent. Sey-
mour's "Fright Night" in the 
late '60s and early ' 70 ' , with 
hi s clever commentary on 
unci ever movies and inspired 
comedic set pieces, established 
a s tandard which will 
probably never be equalled; his 
technique was recently 
exploited ad absurdum by Sal 
U. Lloyd on Channel Six's 
"Disasterpiece Theater." 

Cassandra "E l vira" 
Peterson seems to have more 
for t he size of her chest than of 
her acting ability, but at leas t 
sh 's better than h r movies . 
In fact , her delivery of writer 
Larry Thomas' often funn y 
material , s uch as a debate over 
whether s tolid s tar Smith is 
doing a bad Kirk Douglas or a 
good Jack Palance imitation, 
ca n be rat her amusing. She is 
aided immeasurabl y by the 
commercia l cameos of 
Chucklin ' Cal Worthington , 
whose Inc(':-'S<lnt used -car

Atotnicafe provides an evening of surprises 
L' Olllillll('d h:um page I ·~ 
comput er sy ntheSizer ana 
played back with the various 
mus icians mimicking the ir 
respect ive parts. Then the 
piece was repeated with the 
mus icians actually playingthe 
composition . 

The combination of tape and 
ins truments 'eemed to be a 
comical approach to perform-
ing the work but the end result 
was satis fying. Also, the piece 
had an upbeat kind of score 
which contributed to the 
facetiousness of the pi ece. 

Victor Zupanc's Ode to 
Oliver represented for me one 
of the musical high points of 
the evening. Like Verin 's 
piece, Oliver was composed on 
a digital / computer synthesi-
zer, an infinitely versatile 
instrument t hat can produce 
an endless variety of sounds. 
The sample and hold 
technique created was hes of 
sound - ranging fr om 
percuss ive video game·like 
sounds to room·shaking low 
frequency vibrations that 
amply d e m on s tnHed th e 
quality of the sound system 
u sed for the performance. 

John W o lf' s th ea t e r 
performance piece could best 
be described as ver y s trange. 
the script ranged from very 
gruff vocalizat ions of vowel-
l ike sou nd s to u nus u al 
man nerisms like s hoveling. 
T he action was stepped up by 
si ngle hand claps creat ing a 
paced mi n i·vignet te of 'cenes 
cu lminati ng in a four part 
monologue proclaiming "r am 
limit less power, I am 

perfecI ion , J am infinity - [ 
am!" Very st range indeed. 

Dav id Dramm's composi-
tion Omero at firs t came across 
as a series of explosions or t he 
sound of compress ion brakes 
on a big rig diesel. However , 
Dramm intended the piece to 
"flow w it h a bloodl ine 
runn i ng throu gh it. " A 
repit ition t hrough variat ion or 
"slow evo lution to eventu ally 
contrast w it h itself" was t he 
i nt e nt , but th e ge nera l 
con 'ensus was tha t it sounded 
like a series of explosions. 

The v ideo work by Jan 
Peacock broke up the musical 
performances and made for a 
pleasa n t if not unu s u a l 
digression . News From The In· 
Between can best be described 
as the collage of lifestyles 
experienced by the composer. 

A brief intermission was 
followed by probably t he 
evenings most esoteric piece, 
Catherine Shieve's Weaving, 
Shieve , who has s everal 
albums out on the Folkways 
label , provided a score that 
was o ften fu g ue· like in 
pre se ntati o n , with t h e 
instruments (flut e, recorder , 
bassoon , ce llo, bass, vibes and 
voice) taking on an imitative 
sound , making for an eerie but 
oddly beau tiful piece, 

Certain ly the most powerful 
work of the evening was Lee 
Ray's A Portion 0/ Catalog oj 
Cniologs . The combination of 
tape, I wo s imultaneou s 
monologues and s lides were 
interesting but the most 
engagi ng part o f thi s 

An Evening of 
Pinter an 

performance was the Juxtapo· 
s iti on of t h e bes t ·s eller 
Scruples and t he wr itings of 
Jim Jones. The absurdness of 
Scruples combined with Jones' 
words made for a comica l 
effect; one that was probably 

flot intendep b Jhe.,£oIJ]pos.eL- !Vlo . .'!YeL~ th ere foune! 
Ray, something to enjoy. Atomi· 

Unfortu nately one of the cafe's next performance will 
eveni ngs most promising be No ve mber 3, which 
works, Elma Mayer' s Like was promises to have more musical 
cancelled . Nevertheless the perfo rmance s, including 
evening was a success and all Mayer' s Like.
