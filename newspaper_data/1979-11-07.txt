Frosh Record Way Late, 
Guardian, AS Blame Mails 
Printing Co. For Delay 

By Jenifer Warren 
The UCSD Freshman Record, originally scheduled for release 

Oct. 22, will probably arrive in mid· November, over three weeks 
lat. 

Designed for new students, The Record contains photographs 
and biographical information on freshmen. Also included is a 
twelve-page introductory section on univeristy phone numbers, 
calendars, student organizations and activities, athletic and social 
schedules and community involvement. 

Why the delay? 
Representatives of Institutional Serviceli, Inc. approached the 

Daily C~ardian and the Associated Students lalit summer, 
offering the two 25 cents a copy each if they co-sponsored the 
manual and put together the introductory section. 

Both Carlos Montalvo, AS president. and Harry Tolen, Doily 
Guardian general manager , agreed, and set about making the 
section. 

Tolen says he finished and mailed it to 151 in mid-July, but 151 
says it never came. Tolen attributes the problem to the POlital 
Service. 

So, Tolen says, the Daily Cuardian tried to put the section back 
together in September, despite being "swamped with work," and 
sent a new version to 151 in the beginning of that month. 

Since then, says Tolen, the company has had "press delays" 
and has not sent the finished Record back here. 

Freshmen expecting to pick up the Record in the Daily 
Guardian office two weeks ago have exprelised anger at the 
delay. 

SACRAMENTO (AP) - Califomia gave 
lands~de approval yesterday to the "Spirit of 
13" government spending ~mits initiative and 
to an anti-busing amendment to the state 
constitution. 

Proposition 4, the state and local 
government spending ~mits measure, led by 
nearly 3-1. . 

Proposition 1, the anti-busing amendment, 
led by nearly 2-1. 

A statewide ballot proposition that would 
repeal a 45-year-old interest ceilill8 on some 
business loans was also approved by voters. 
That measure, Proposition 2, was depicted in 
television commercials as a step toward lower 
interest rates, and there was no opposition 
campajgn. 

In San Francisco, Dianne Feinstein, who 
became interim mayor following the 
aSlallination of George Moscone last year, 
narrowly led Supervisor Quentin Kopp in a 10-
way race for a full four-year term as major. 
They face a Dec. 11 runoff. 

Two controversial San Francisco baUot 
propositions, a 20-story limit on new 
skyscrapers and a rent control measure, both 
trailed in early retums. 

Growth control measures were trailing in 
early returns in six of eight California 
communities where there were local issues on 
the baUot. 

The only growth control proposals winning in 
early returns were a Riverside limit on lot sizes 
for hillside properties and a nonbinding

With one race still too close to call, San 

Diego voters returned a moderate City Council 
in elections yesterday covering half the city's 
districts. 

With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, 
Republican Steve Witbnan and Democrat 
Mike Gotch were separated by 190 votes out of 
140,230 cast. 

Voters were decisive in three other council 
race., however. 

Incwnbents Lucy Killea and Leon Wdliams 
won lands tide victories, and favored BiD Cleater 
won a comfortable victory over Lou Ridgeway. 

San Diego voters also approved aD five local 
propositions before them, thereby 
accomplishing the following: 

The Board of Supervisors now has the 
authority to choose between the U.S. ManhaI's 
and Sheriff's office as the agency to serve court 
papers (A); "Council member" will now be used 
to designate city council representatives instead 
of "councilman" (B); San Diego political 
conduct laws will now confonn with stricter 
state laws (C); Board of Education residency 
requirements will now conform to state 
residency requirements (0); and some city 
workers will lose their civil service status and be 
directly responsible to elected officials (E). 

Witbnan and Gotch fought an acrimonious 
campaign after Gotch charged that Witbnan 
had taken campaign fW'lCls for personal use. 

Witbnan denied the charges, which received 
wide publicity, and .. ked the district attomey'.

Panel: Linguistic and Political 
Barriers Hanning African Media 

By Lynette Tom 
Senior Staff Writer 

Trying to establish mass 
communications systems in 
nations with convoluted ethnic 
and po~tical boundaries is one 
of Africa's major problems, 

pane~sta from across that 
continent said here yesterday. 

Countrymen must "not only 
be able to communicate 
between themselves, but also 
communicate with their 
brothers anc.l sisters in states 
divided in franco-form and 
anglo-form zones ," Liberian 
novelist Bai T. Moore 
believes. 

One way of solving this, he 
says, is his country's policy of 
communications, which "is 
geared to make everyone 
literate in English," so that 
Liberia can continue with its 
national policy. 

The choice of a language 
for . use in communications, 
according to University of 
Zambia professor Mubanga 
Kashoki. lies with govern· 
ments, lind these policies vary 
with the historical back-
grounds of the reasons behind 
such a decision. 

Hill native country makes 

use of English and seven 
African languages local to the 
country and being taught as 
school subjects. But Kashoki 
believes "people are reached 
more through the African 

lan~ua§es than through 
Eng~sh. 

There is a mood in Africa to 
try to make greater use of 
African languages in 
government and national life. " 

Moore concurs: 
"We need to develop a 

policy which encourages and 
promotes our cultural heritage 
and preserves it," said the 
Deputy Minister of Informa. 

tion and Cultural Affairs. 
Music also falls into 

national classifications. 
The lighter side of the topic 

was executed by Nigerian 
professor Sam\lel Akabot, 
who entitled his presentation, 
"Everything You Wanted To 
Know About African Music, 
But Were Afraid To Ask." 

Akabot's view of communi· 
cations is focused upon 
traditional African music, 
which is tied to language, as 
exemp~fjed by the fact that 
African musicians know what 
to play ahead of time without a

Ducking 'the Issues . 
Editor: 

I would ~ke to write this 
letter in reference to the "Phil 
Blazer" lecture on Nov. I. I 
was under the impression that 
the speaker was to clarify 
lOme of the issues surrounding 
Jeae JacklOIl's Mideast visit 
and the current black·Jewilih 
rift. E'.uentially, what is needed 
is to unearth some means for 
establishing a constructive 
blaCk·Jewish dialogue. Hal 
Sloane, Blazer'. fill· in, did not 
address himself to these 
pertinent issues. 

I only hope that blacks and 
Jews will not let Jesse 
Jackson's prostitution of 
Christian faith to terrorilllll and 
Arab dollars ruin a history of 
cooperation between blacks 
and Jews. I can only think that 
Martin Luther King, a man 
who taught the world what 
peaceful resistance means, 
would have deplored such a 
capitulation to terrorism.

be at the root of the strife

between black. and Jews were 
dealt with in the .peech: 
- Bakke case. Some blacks 

feel that Jews are pushing 
blacks out of colleges, yet 
some Jews deplore the fact 
that affirmative action ' 
programs never regard Jews 
as a minority and that reverse· 
discrimination may exist; 

- Busing. The media i. 
Iwnping minority groups into 
factions of for or against 
busing without regarding splits 
within minority groups; 
- South Africa. Some blacks 

deplore Israeli trade with 
South Africa; however, some 
Jews feel that they are being 
judged by a double standard, 
since the United States is at the 
top in terms of trade with 
South Africa, and black 
African nations follow close 
behind. Israel is close to the 
bottom of the list and their 
trade relations do not consist 
of military supplies, which 
others' do. (Even with this 
double standard I personally 
disagree with Israeli trade 
relations with South Africa.) 

Let us, blacks and Jews, 
therefore resolve to discuss 
and debate these issues and 
not lose our important 
friendship. There is much 
injustice in this world that we 
can annul by working 
together. Let's fight this 
injustice, let's not fight each 
other.

Do We Need Romance ' 

Carter Getting A Bum Rap 
By M.N. Plano 

After read!ng the syndicated report by 
Mervyn Field In the Oct. 31 Daily Guardian ._ 
the article describing President Carter's abysmal 
showing in the polls -- I went home and spent a 
fair amount of time thinking. Then I picked up 
the Los Angeles Times and a few other news and 
science magazin~s to see if I could find anything 

M.N. Plano i. a UCSD graduate student 
to warrant his having a lower popularity than 
even Nixon in the depths of Watergate. 

Why was I perplexed? Well, for one thing, I 
haven't met more than three people in as many 
months who didn't think that Carter's doing a 
better job than he's given credit for. The polls do 
say that 85% of all Americans think he's "good 
honest, and hardworking." In all my adult lif~ 
I've never heard another president so labeled. 

Hmmm. Maybe it's his attitude towards 
wohlen and minorities. Today's Times reports 
that he appointed his third woman cabinet 
member. No other president has ever had more 
than one. Shirley Hufstedler is likely to be the first 
woman Supreme Court justice. She was the only 
woman appeals court justice until Carter 
appointed 10 more. Carter also doubled the 
nwnber of blacks in decision making posts and 
quietly-tripled the nwnber of Hispanics. No, that 
can't be it. 

Here I read a judge just threw out the justice 
department's charges against the mayor of 
Philadelphia. Maybe pebple don't like Carter for 
persecuting Frank Rizzo? 

Could it be the environmental matters? With 
the lands use, redwoods, and Alaska lands 

... the best 
president 
Roosevelt. 

environmental 
• sInce Teddy 

actions behind him, plus ~his year's successful 
whale negotiations, I'm afraid I'm as perplexed 
as ever. A Sierra Club leader called him the best 
environmental president since Theodore 
Roosevelt. Naw, it can't be the environment. 

Let's see. He broke up the old Atomic Energy 
Commission. He stopped Clinch River, the B-1 
and the Neutron Bomb and established a 
national solar bank. No, the no-nuke people 
can't be the ones who hate him . 

For years everyone to the left of Max Rafferty 
has cried, "get us out of the dictator business! " 
Well, our dictators sure are dropping like flies . 
Somoza , Romero, Macias , Bokassa, Amin, and 
the Shah and now old Park of Korea . Gosh! All 
those old boys long propped up by the clever 
Yankees. Either Carter's not a very competent 
"propper-upper," or ... or ... 

Naw. It couldn', be that quietly, wit hout a lot 
of hooplah. the President is saying, "No more." 

Hmmm. I read that , for the first time ir history 
the Organization of American Slates has ~et 
principles for the observation of human and civil 

rights. The OAS is acting on Bolivia's century 
old deprivation of a seaport, a US resolution. 

Of course no o'ne takes Carter's "human 
rights" campaign seriously. 

Except the peoples of Nigeria Guinea 
Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador or the bominica~ 
Republic, which have all had their first free and 
open election$ in 10 to 20 years during the last 
10 months. 

Or the peoples of Guinea, Uganda or Central 
African Republic or at least a dozen more 
nations that this year are saner than before. Or 
the Chinese dissidents at "Democracy Wall," or 
the 250,000 Indochinese who are now 
productive Americans. 

He dropped Clinch River, 
the B-1 and the Neutron 
Bomb ... 

Or the children of Tel Aviv and Cairo. 
Or the prisoners in Chile and Brazil who, for 

the first time, are ~etting Red Cross visits, forced 
by "international' pressure. -

Will somebody explain to me how you cut 
inflation when our foreign oil bill has gone up 
60% this year? Unemployment is at a five-year 
low, in spite of a doubling of the female 
workforce, and the trade deficit (barring oil) has 
plummeted. 

I put down the papers and magazines, still 
confused. Maybe I've missed something. With a 
stupid, scatterbrained Congress and a thousand 
special interest groups screaming "gimme," the 
fellow has avoided at least SIX cnances, that I've 
counted, to pull a "Mayaguez" and shoot his 
popularity up to the eighties. I trust his finger 
near the button. I'm not 50 sure about Teddy's. 

Can anyone out there explain it to me? What 
has Teddy Kennedy to offer but a brilliant 
speaking voice, some romantic illusions and -a 
ghost hell (perhaps dangerously) always be 
trying to live up to? 

In the end, I think Carter's unforgivable sin is 
that he's like Daddy. Reliable. hardworking, 
boring. The nation 's mood , abetted by the 
eastern press, is like a teenager entering his 
"frustration" period. Sure, Dad's always there. 
Sure h~ delivers ... "But he 's always lecturing me 
about 'responsibility ' and saving energy and 
boring crap like thaI." 

Yup. Just like a teenager . Teenagers love both 
cynicism and romance, alternately . Their 
fav,orite mood, when cared 10', is sullenness. 

Ah, but romance. Read your history. What is 
it that the romantic figures in the history of 
nations are known for? Whal have they used, 
since time immemorial, to elicit the powerful 
enthusiasm of youth? What is it the shining 
knights on white horses have called the teenagen. 
out for? 

War.

Walkout at Diablo Iran Oil Flow Stops Embassy: No Force 
TEHRAN - Iranian oil exports apparently were 

choked off yesterday by it shutdown of the country's 
only crude oil port. A U.S. official said the shutdown 
may have stemmed from a strike by port workers . 

Initial reports came to administration and 
congresuonalsources from the CIA. 

The reporte4 shutdown at Iran' s -Kharg Island 
came as the United States sought to negotiate the 
release of about 60 hostages held by militant students 
at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. The students and the 
government are demanding that the deposed Shah 
Mohammad Reza Pahlevi be returned from New 
York to face trial in Iran. 

There had been threats that the revolutionary 
government might halt oil shipments to the United 
States in an effort to enforce that demand. 

A State Department official said initial reports 
indicated that l~e suspension barred all tankers from 
loading, not only those of the United States. The' 
official, who declined to be identified , said initial 
fragmentary reports suggested that the shutdown 
involved a strike. 

Vatican's in 'Debt 
VATICAN CITY - The Vatican's top financial 

experts briefed Roman Catho~c cardinals yesterday 
on the state of the Holy See's holdings. A senior 
cardinal said the annual deficit is somewhere 
between $12 million and $18 million. 

The senior cardinal, who asked not to be identified, 
told the Associated Press the overall budget of the 
Holy See totals around $36 million. He noted this is 
separate from the Institute for Religious Works. 

W ASH INC TON - Officials said here yester~ay 
the United States will not use force to free about 60 
American hostages threatened by demonstrators 
occupying the American Embassy in Tehran and it 

ex~cts Iranian authorities to protect them. 
The Palestine Liberation Organization, which has 

good relations with Iran's Islamic regime, said it 
would send a delegation to Tehran to try and save the 
hostages' lives. 

Protection, of the embassy captives is now the 
responsibility of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's 
Revolutionary Council, which the religious leader 
ordered to run the country after Prime· Minister 
Mehdi Bazargan and his Cabinet resigned yesterday. 
Both Khomeini and his council have been issuing 
statements backing the emballY invaders' demand 
that ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi be 
returned for trial. 

Don't Ask About Sex 
ST. PETERSBURG - School administrators 

weren't pleased when lOth grade Linda Heath

she spent her 15th birthday on suspension. 

The two·page survery, a project for Mi .. Heath's 
IOth.grade journalism class at St. Petersburg High 
School, asked students to respond anonymously to 
questions such as : Do you feel there is pressure to 
have sex? Are you a virgin? Would you consider 
abortion? Is contraception necessary? Do you 
believe in premarital sex? 

Mi .. Heath, who served the one-day suspension 
Monday, said she would appeal.

Saturn Surprises 
Researchers With 
'A New Vista' 

By Peter Mortenaen 
Although ill has been over 

two montha since Pioneer 11 
made its rendezvous with the 
planet Saturn, NASA 
researchers, including two 
from UCSD, continue to leam 
from the vast amount ot data 
transmitted back from the 
ri"§.ed planet. 

There certainly has been a 
rea.onable amount of 
surprileli -- things that nobody 
guessed beforehand," said Dr. 
Carl Mcllwan, who worked 
along with Dr_ Walker Faliu8, 
at NASA's Ames Research 
Center . in Mountain View 
during the weeks Pioneer 11 
was closest to Saturn_ 

environment like that 
(Saturn), you don't know what 
to expect... we had some 
expectations, but mostly it's 
just looking on a new vista and 
trying to understand it, and 
that's what we're still in the 
process of doing," explained 
Mdlwan. 

Data rela ted to the 
magnetosphere indicates that 
the radiation belts on Saturn 
are completely eliminated by 
the rings because their high 
energy particles mirror back 
and forth between Saturn's 
poles, ultimately to be 
absorbed by the-ring material 
itself. 

The Daily Guardian Wedne8day, November 7. 1879 

Perhaps one of the most 
significant achievements of the 
Saturn flyby was that the 
spacecraft sustained no 
damage from high-velocity 
ring particles. According to 
NASA, this proves that any 
man-made probe can operate 
in the vicinity of -the visible 
rings. 

It is this phen,omenon which 
creates what scientists believe 
is the most radiation-free 
sector of space discovered to 
date. Further data from the 
Pioneer 11 may confirm this, 
NASA saYIi. 

Saturn: ~. and a new understanding. 

Mcllwan and F'dliWl are 
particularly interested in the 
data returned from the craft'. 
"trapped radiation detector." 
The 3.9-pound device was 
built at UCSD and was 
designed to detect high energy 
particles trapped in Saturn's 
mas!'!!to&phere. 

"When you go to a new 

''There are many features of 
Saturn which we're just 
beginning to understand ," 
Mdlwan said. "We're seeing 
effects of the rings and the 
moons on the data and as we 
develop an understanding of 
that we can see more of what is 
going on in that environment, 
but we're still in the process of 
putting those pieces together," 
he added. 

In addition to magneto-
sphere discoveries aided by 
the UCSD physicists, 

Associated Students 

scientists are quite enthusiastic 
over the discovery of Saturn's 
11 th moon, temporarily 
named 1979SI. Although it 
was conjectured that two new 
Saturian moons had been 
discovered, NASA states that 
the same 400 km-diameter 
body was most probably 
recorded in two different 
positi'ons by Pioneer 
instrumentation. 

Another significant result of 
the Pioneer flyby is the 
discovery that temperatures 
on both Saturn and its moon

Cal Space Institute F onned; 
Will Get Cottage at Scripps 
Center Starts With Satellite Data 

By Stan Honda 
Staff Writer 

The UC-funded California Space Institute is 
being fonned at UCSD to "bring people together 
for studies of space," according to Dr. James 
Arnold, professor of chemistry here. 

The center, scheduled to begin operation 
within a few months, will be located in "a small 
cottage" at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 
says Arnold. 

It wai focus on space research involving the 
use of satellite data, such as astronomy, weather, 
environmental and oceanographic studies_ 

According to Arnold, the university chose to 
locate the center at UCSD because "San Diego is 
one of the outstanding campuses in the area of 
space sciences. Besides projects in astronomy 
(offered through the physics department), 
Scripps has a wide variety of research utilizing 
the newly installed satellite data receiving station 
there." 

Another reason, he continued, is that Scripps 
Director William Nierenberg "wanted the 
institute at UCSD and was willing to get space for 
it." 

Planning for the institute began three years 

ago with the support of about 40 faculty 
members from each UC campus. This past year, 
said Arnold, the bulk of the planning has been in 
Chancellor McElroy's office with input from UC 
Vice President Donald Swain, Arnold , Physics 
Professor Carl Mcilwain, and Gustaf Arrhenius 
and Robert Bernstein from Scripps. 

The Regents have awarded Cal Space 
$380,000 for the first year to fund researcfi 
projects , purchase lab equipment, sponsor 
seminars and pay salaries, said Arnold. 

Arnold has been appointed acting director of 
Cal Space for the first two years. 

Although the center will focus on space 
scienc~s,. not all space research will be conducted 
there. 

"In fact, many (ongoing) projects are much 
too big for the institute in terms of space required 
and funding ," said Arnold. 

Lab space will also be provided for the space 
researchers , he said. 

"One objective (of Cal Space) is to bring 
scientists together to discuss relevant techniques 
that will benefit each party ," said Arnold, "And 
hopefully seminars can be held at the institute to 
discuss the research_ "

This is part of a continuing 
~ffOrl by NASA to use student

Ladwig. 'NASA usea 

scholarships, claiming "it 
could not ha ve been done 
without the students." 

"NASA has an interest in

getting students interested in 
the space program, as they will 
be needing 9ualified people in 
the future,' according to 
Ladwig, 

In the past, high schools 

students included the logo 
design contest for the Viking 

,and various scientific projects 
for skylab, the most famous 
being the effects of 
weightlessness on spiders. 

The workshop to plan the 
college competition is being 
organized for NASA .for the 
Forum for the Advancement 
of Students in Science and 
Technology. The purpose of 
the workshop is to get the 
program off the ground and to 

of high energy physics, 
atmospheric phenomena , life 
sciences, and pollution 
control. The workshop will 
organize the competition, from 
which about 20 projects will he 
selected each year. 

According to Ladwig more 
than 50 organizations have 
been invited to participate 
from the.fields of Aft'onautics, 
physics and chemistry,· as well 
as from organizations 
representing minorities and 

Plans for a competition 
between experiments will be 
drawn up at the NASA 
headquarters in Washington, 
DC on Nov. 29 and 30. The 
competition is due to beain in 
the faD of 1980 and the 
experimenll wiD be Rown in 
1981 or 1982, depending on 
available space in the shuttle, 
according to Alan Ladwig, 
spokesman for the project. 

During the Viking program, 
college students anisted 
NASA scientists at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena_ "They were very 
valuable," said Ladwig. When 
the Viking program received 
an award from the National 
Association for the Advance-
ment of Science, the scientists 
donated the money for 

... it is part 01 their charter to involve the public." 
have been more involved in 
NASA's scientific and non-
scientific projects than

More Than Just a Novelty 
By Timothy Mackenzie 

The music industry as a whole ca nnot 
be thought of as the most progressive of 
industries. It is in a slump now,due in no 
small part to its resistance to change and 
ma nifested by the fact that it 
overshipped records that nobody really 
wanted . 

Stories abound of talented young 
bands stifled by what Communications 
20 students know as the "corporate 
structure." The frustrating thing is that 
the stifling effect is more often the rule 
than the exception for bands dealing 
with the record companies. Perhaps it 
was most aptly stated by Bob Geldorf, 
group leader of the Boomtown Rats , a.n 
Irish New Wave band. Addressmg thIS 
year's CBS Records Convention, 
Gledorf commented: "You've been told 
over the last three days that CBS is a real 
fa mily, full of warm and wonderful 
human b~ings . I think you all know that 
you're really just a bunch of bastards. " 

record stores from becoming disco· 
marts . It boosted and triggered a revival 
of local bands in Los Angeles and San 
Diego, bringing with it a revived club 
scene and a cast of hungry and 
aggressive songwriters and musicians. 

One of the most developed and 
competitive of the lot is Doriot Negrette, 
singer/ songwriter and leader of the 
Dinettes, a band that should be 
prominent on the list of great record 
company catches. The Dinettes gained 
their initial notoriety from the fact that 
they are a band staffed exclusively by 
women. But drawing from Negrette's 
original material, the band seems 
destined to attain a reputation as 
straight· shooting, first·degree rockers . 

If you think it is easy to become a rock 
star you should have your head 
examined and your blood cleansed of 
THC. But to do it with an all-female 
cast, well, let's just say it takes a hell of a 
lot of efforl. Expecially if you want to be 
taken seriously. 

The all-female band is a concept on 
which Negrette, a UCSD student, has 
been working for a couple of years now. 
Most people think of Kim Fowley's 
Runaways when they think of girls in a 
band, an image that is difficult for 
women musicians to get away from. 

This posture was shared by the vast 
majority of the late 70s New Wave rock 
bands. as the New Wave. rather 
ironically, became the only thing that 
kept the record companies afloat. The 
big labels were slow and awkward in 
responding to New Wave bands and 
dev eloping their "commercial 
potential." The most convincing 
evidence for them this year was The 
Knack, which got its start on the Jocal 
club scene and managed to make its 
debut album for a paltry $18,000. The 
Stones, by comparison, probahly spend 
that much on drugs alone for studio 
sessions. 

"Being an all-female band can be a 
hindrance at first," Negrette admitted 
during a Los Angeles Times interview. 
"People just come to see us thinking 
we're a novelty act. But now we find a lot . 
of girls come up to us, want to talk to us 
- they identify with us. We feel we're

the strength of Negrette's

Saturn Surprises 
Continued from (>age 4 

At 3.2 billion kilometers (2 
billion miles) from earth, 
Saturn i the most distant 
planet yet reached in USA 
exp lora tion of the so lar 
system. Pioneer spent 10 
days photogra phing and 
measuring Saturn and its 
moon at the end of a six year 
journey there. 

After making its closest 
a pproach to Saturn on Sept. 1, 
comi ng within 20 ,800 km 
(n,OOO miles) at a speed of 
114 ,500 km/ hr (71,200 
mph) , Pioneer used the 
planet's gravi ty to swing 
almost 90 deg rees and 

cha nged its course toward the 
edge of the solar system. 

Barring any mechanical 
failure , Pioneer will be 
returning useful data to Earth 
until the late 1980s, at which 
time it will exceed the limit of 
radio contact with NASA 
ground receiving stations. 

The Pioneer program is 
directed by the Office of Space 
Science, NASA Headquarters 
in Washington, DC, while 
projec t management is vested 
in NASA's Ames Research 
Center. The Pioneer 11 
spacecraft was built by TRW 
Systems in Redondo Beach.

either. Am I going to get my money back?" asked one irate 
student. 

Possibly, Tolen and Montalvo say. 
The two are considering using the dIstrIbution fee paid the 

government and newspaper to fund a contest with prizes as an 
apology to the 900 students who ordered copies of the manual. 

But Tolen says the 151 contract is written in such a way as to 
preclude refunds , " It's very cleverly worded. We won't sign a 
contract like that again, " he says.

As Proposition 1 a~ 
headed ffX' vict«y Iut night, 
the president of the Loa 
Anceles Board of Education 
announced the board will meet 
later this week to plan an end 
to mandatory busing in the 
city's school .y.tern. 

Con,inlll'd from p('Ut' 1 
sheet of music before them. 

"The reason, cites Akabot, is 
that "the musiciana rt the 
beats from the words.' 

African music, u seen in 
the eyes of University of Lagos 
profellor Akin Euba, is 
divided into two idioms: 
traditional and contemporary. 
Theae idioms, when filtered 
through the media, undergo 
the problem. of transmitting 
an equal balance of traditional 
and popular music on radio 
and television, and of 
publi.hing contemporary 
music within the financial 
means and the publisher's 
cultural background. 

He ended his presentation 
with a piano piece entitled, 
"Scenes From Traditional 

Life," which illustrated his, as 
well u that of other composers 
in hi. country, trend to actively 
combine the elements of 
African and Western muaic, 
and head towards what he 
caUs "African pianoiam." 

Zambian ethnomusicology 
• expert Mwesa Mapoma takes 
on the objective of 

. communications in music as 
one of trying "to understand 
what people do in music," .uch 
that "people can enjoy music 
not only u sound, but u a 
meaning that can be 
appreciated." He considers 
the research being done at the 
University of Zambia to find 
out and enumerate the 
different kinds of music, 
understand what they mean to 
people, and see how they can 

be used. 
Television, as Zairean 

educational TV head 
Kabango Kala1a-Kanda put it, 
"ill not a common language of 
the people" in his native Zaire. 
However, he considers 
the foreign shows that are 
broadcasted to their station.
