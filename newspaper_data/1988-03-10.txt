Popkin predicts 
Bush will win 
By J. BERESFORD-HOWE 
Opilfiolf Edito, 

It's over. You missed it. 
George Bush got elected Pre-

sident Tuesday, three months 
before you even had a chance to 
vote in the California primary. 

That's the conclusion CBS pol-
lster and UCSD Political Science 
Profe so r Sam Popkin offered 
to a meeting of the Chancellor's 
As ociate at Chancellor Atkin-
son 's ho~se ye terday afternoon . 

" Bob Dole lost any chance to 
be President and George Bush 
nailed the Presidency," Popkin 
said , attributing Bush' win to 
events culminating Super Tues-
day but beginning three days 
before the New Hampshire 
primary. 

"Three things happened in 
those three days. Dole appeared 
impolite, aggressive and tough at 
a televised debate. But the main 
things were the Bush ads suggest-
ing that Dole was questionable 
on taxes, with no Dole response, 
and that Bush organized New 
Hampshire the way Robertson 
did Iowa. One-third of the peo-
ple who voted in New Hamp-
shire voted with the help of an 
organization. That's the entire 
Bush margin," Popkin said. 

The Democratic race for a 
sacrificial candidate to Bush is 
still hopelessly muddled, Popkin 
said . 

"Dukakis did not prove he can 
get votes outside the North. Half 
the people who vote in the South 
in elections these days weren't 
born there. Dukakis beat Gore 
two to one among these people. 

"Among people born in the 
South, Gore beat Dukakis two 
to one. All Dukakis did was 

prove he can get Northerners 
wherever they live," he said. 

Popkin said that Gore still has 
a shot at doing well even though 
the Southern primaries are over. 

"He could do well in Ohio," 
Popkin said. "It's a southern 
state politically. And there's the 
coal mine region of Pennsylva-
nia, and Southern Illinois." 

Popkin's vision of the conven-
tion appear to be one in which 
no candidate ha the nomination 
locked up beforehand, with five 
group holding large blocks of 
delegates: Gore, Dukakis, Jack-
son , a fading Gephardt and the 
so-called "Super-delegates," the 
over 500 Democratic office hold-
ers who go to the convention 
formally uncommitted as per new 
Democratic party rules. 

"With that many people hold-
ing all the cards, the winner has 
got to come from one of them. 
Cuomo couldn't go into the con-
vention holding no cards and get 
the nomination," Popkin said . 

Popkin also commented on 
the two ministers still cam-
paigning. 

While discounting the practi-
cal effect of Pat Robertson on 
the Republican field, Popkin 
noted that Robertson's support 
in Iowa is among the young. 

"Among Republican voters 
under 45 in Iowa, Robertson 
won. He is the candidate of young 
and of women in the Republican 
party. Senior citizens pulled 
Iowa out for Bob Dole," he said,. 

The Democrat Jesse Jackson, 
Popkin said , could make the 
Democratic ticket through con-
vention brokering. 

"I really think it could hap-
pen," he said . "It would be a 
disaster for the party, but) really 
think it could happen. IQI 

•• ectlon - UCSO political science professor Sam Popkin said 
that senator Robert Dole's candidacy was self-destructive during 
the three days before the New Hampshire primary.

Comm students march 
fer department changes 
By PETER MESSROBIAN 
NewJEdito, 

A small group of UCSD com-
munication students delivered 
statement to a group of faculty 
members yesterday which expres-
sed their "disappoint[ment] with 
the structure of the communica-
tion department" and included 
demands for more emphasis on 
practical courses and greater 
student input on faculty selection 
and curriculum development. 

The primary concern of the 
new movement, which plans to 
continue its pressure on the 
administration and department , 
is that students be given a voice 
in the development of the com-
munication department. 

") think students should take a 
greater part in what goes on in 
their education ," said Brian 
Clark, one of the movement 
leaders. "There's a new interest 
in being a part of the faculty 

selection process . . . some of us 
would like to see that [process] 
changed ... 

"I just wish there was more 
[student] input on who they hire 
in the department, because they 
define what the department is," 
communication major Luana 
Plunkett said . "We have good 
people [professors] that come 
here, and they're not invited to 
stay. Why not keep the ones 
really appreciated by the stu-
dents?" 

Several students expressed 
disapproval with what they des-
cribed as the emphasis on theo-
retical , rather than practical , 
courses in the department. 

"This whole school is theory," 
communication major Laurie 
Burns said . "Nothing is practical. 
From people I talk to that have 
graduated [with communication 
degrees] ... they have no ex-
perience in any type of field ." 

Another movement leader, 

Entrepreneur to 
teach new class 
By CHRIS HAMSON St"', W,ite, 

A cia s on entrepreneurship, 
free to UCSD students and 
faculty , is being offered through 
University Extension spring 
quarter. The class will cost $145 
for member of the public. 

The popular cia , "How to 
Start a New Enterpri e," will be 
raught by R.B. 'Buzz' Woolley, 
pre ident of Girard Capital , Inc., 
and is pon ored by Connect, the 
UCSD program in Technology 
and Entrepreneur hip. 

" 'Buzz ' Woolley will draw on 

his own experience as a venture 
capitalist and entrepreneur and 
will invite one guest speaker every 
cia meeting," aid Barbara Bry, 
associate director of Connect. 
The clas is offered on Tuesday 
evenings, 7-9:30 pm, tarting 
April 5. tudents will meet ix 
time . 

Last year thi limited enroll-
ment course quickl y filled : 
"Mo t were members from'the 
publi c, " Br aid . "We had 30-40 
people on a waiting list," he 
added . La t pring wa the first 
time the cour e wa offered . 

See CLASS, pale 3 

Lisa Askins, echoed Burns 'com-
plaint. "The main problem [is 
that there are] so many theory 
classes, and not enough practical 
classes, " she said . 

The catalyst of the movement 
was the department's failure to 
rehire a popular visiting pro-
fessor . according to Clark. "Basi-
cally, this all started a couple of 
weeks ago, when Lisa and ) 
found out that Robyn Hunt was 
not offered a contract to [teach]," 
Clark recalled . 

Hunt , a lecturer in the com-
munication department, is only 
the latest in a list of popul~r 
faculty to not have their contracts 
renewed , according to Clark . 

When Askins and he found 
out about what happened to 
Hunt , they decided to organize a 
meeting on the ninth week of 
school and hold a rally tenth 
week . Last week's meeting at-
tracted more than 50 students, 
and about a dozen showed up for 
the rally.

shared by roommates, each person 
who paid rent is eligible for the indi-
vidual credit of 560.

be used to file for the tax credit. If you 
use Form 540 to file your California 
taxes, you must fill out the separate

The renter's credit is included in Form 
540A. Refer to 1987 California Resi-
dent Income Tax Form and Ins/ruc-
tions to determine which form to use .

complete your name, address, Social 
Security number, filing status, lines 24, 
25, 26 and 29, signature, and date on

communication department is 
located, some students joined a 
meeting of the department fa-
culty. They then watched a video 
shot by James Torres, one of the 
movement leaders. The video 
contained both footage of people 
lined up to register in communi-
cation classes (some of whom 
had arrived as early as 3 am) and 
interviews with students, who 
aired their complaints and sug-
gestions to the department. 

After the video concluded, 
some students asked questions 
of the faculty, and vice-versa. 
Professor Chandra M ukerji men-
tioned that student interest in 
faculty hiring decisions had fallen 
off a few years ago. "[We] used 
to have a lot of students parti-
cipating in selecting new profes-
sors," she said, adding that recent 
student inpqt has been negli-
gible. 

When the short discussion 
ended, lhe protesters marched to 
the Chancellor's complex. While 
a group of them played various 
musical instruments in the out-
door center of the complex, three 
students, including Askins and 
Torres, met with Social Sciences 
Dean Michael Rothschild. 

The half-hour meeting was 
closed to the press, but after-
wards Rothschild talked about 
it. "I listened to their position 
and I understand it," he said .. 
"They are going to present me 
with documents embodying their 
point of view ... [I'm] going to 
look at them with an open mind 
and consider what they have to 
say. " 

According to Rothschild, he 
and the students primarily dis-
cussed the issue offaculty hiring, 
and the inequities toward per-
formance-oriented professors 
(e.g. visual arts, theatre, and 
music) the students feel is in-
herent in the process. Rothschild 
said later that he "cannot speak 
knowingly about whether or not 
we review [performance-oriented 
professors] well."

Guest Editorial 

Menacing Wheels 
By MARIA GEGES 

Beginning the fall quarter 1987, a policy was 
issued and enforced by the campus police which 
prohibits the riding of bicycles and skateboards in 
specific areas of the UCSD campus. At the beginning 
of the year, 1 recall talking to some Third College 
students who were perturbed about the changes and 
wondered just how they would get to class on time . 

To understand the policy, one must understand 
the circumstances which necessitated a policy change 
for bicycle and skateboard riders . The campus is 
getting crowded. The main mall from Peterson Hall 
to USB is so congested at peak hours of the day, it is 
a wonderthat bike and skateboard riders even made 
it through the crowds of students . 

I remember having m y arms hit by riders whojust 
couldn't stop in time or did not realize that I had 
been hit. And yet even if they knew my arm was in 
the way, they still would not stop to see if I was all 
right. 

Bicycles may be able to stop, but who can 
honestly say that people will be safe when bike riders 
are going full speed ahead of them? The Disabled 
Student Services ' (DSS) carts also have bee n 
invo lved in near-collisions due to the speed and 
negligence of a few people . 

How man y time have we seen skateboarders cut 
off wheelchair users on campus who are trying to 
use a curb cut? Wooden benches are victims of the 
careless skateboarder, who constantly jumps off of 
them and ruins their paint job and finish. 

Bicycles block the way of wheelchair users in 
hallways and near electric doors when they are 
locked to the bars where the button is located . 
Additionally, it appears that bike riders tailgate the 
pedestrian until the "ticki ng" of a ten-speed is heard 
and the person moves out of the way. What if the 
person is hearing-impaired or deaf and can't hear 
the bicycle or skateboard coming up on him or her 
from behind? 

Now as 1 walk the campus, I do see a few rule 
breakers still on bikes and skateboards, but as a 
whole the campus has become considerably safer 
and easier to walk through during the daytime. 

One suggestion I have is that professors be more 
lenient when students must walk long distances to 
ge t to class, or when the bike rider must ride around 
the perimeter of the campus to get to class. The 
UCS D campus should be safe for everyone, because 
watching the wheels roll doesn't mean watching 
them roll over you . 

Geges graduated from Third Col/ege in June 
1987, and is now an Outreach Assistant/or Disabled

Bud Man 
Insulting 
Editor: 

In regard to the preview of the 
men's single 'A' soccer champion-
ships [Guardian, March 3], it's time 
Budman took some of Spuds' advice 
and know when to say when and cut 
the crap. 

In the article , Bud and his astute 
scouts maligned the members of the 
Malpractice squad, referring to them 
as "sandbaggers" that "have been in 
[the)' A . finallhree years in a row." I 
find that remarkable considering that 
over the past three years, the 
members of this squad were in 
school , working the oilfields of Chad, 
perusing the beer halls of Austria, or 
trekking through the Tibetan Hima-
layas, only meeting each other for 
the first time this fall . 

As for "sandbagging," if Bud and 
company had bothered to exercise a 
little capable journalism and com-
mon sense by talking to the team, 
they would have discovered that one 
half of the squad has had little to no 
soccer experience. It does not require 
much more intelligence than that of 
Budman and his writer to see that 
these individuals and their teammates 
are playing on enthusiasm, for the 
love of sport , competition, and fun . 
The last I heard . that was what 

intramural sports was all about. 
From here on out, perhaps the 

Guardian staff ought to take a little 
more care in what they print. 

In addition to the enjoyment, most 
intramural athletes also take their 
sports seriously and deserve a reci-
procal conscientious attitude on the 
part of those who present them to 
the pUblic. Therefore, rt;gardless of 
what happens this weekend, an 
apology is in order, to Malpractice 
and especially to the less experienced 
members of the squad who in the 
course of 10 weeks have learned and 
progressed astoundingly. Good work 
men.

Comm Dept 
Defended 
Editor: 

Very recently on our campus, spe-
cifically in the communications 
department, there have been many 
complaints regarding several topics 
such as preregistration, lack of course 
offerings , not enough staff and 
faculty members, and numerous 
others. 

As a communications major I can 
empathize with most of these. 
Unfortunately another comm. major 
has unempathetically displaced his 

aggression towards the department 
by brutally verbally attacking Greg 
Griffin, the department advisor. This 
backlashed attack against Greg Grif-
fin is in very poor tase and small-
minded. Let's look at the conflicts in 
the comm. department with a little 
more compassion and less narrow-
mindedly! 

First off, it is obvious that there 
are many deficiencies in the comm. 
department such as not enough staff 
and faculty members, not a very 
large amount of course offerings and 
that specific courses that are gradua-
tion requirements are not offered 
frequently enough; the list goes on. 
So, the small staff and faculty that 
we are provided, do their best to 
compensate for these deficiencies. 
With approximately 700 comm. 
majors there is a limited faculty, and 
only one advisor, Greg Griffin. Greg 
Griffin is compassionate, caring, and 
takes sincere, professional interest to 
advise students and meet student 
needs. 

As a transfer student from Oregon 
State University, I have a different 
outlook on the situation in the comm. 
department here at UCSD. At OSU 
there is about the same number of 
overall student enrollment. The 
comm. majors number about half 
the number we have here, there are 
about the same number of profes-
sors, and a much wider variety of 
course offerings. The point here is 
that the ('omm. departments at many 
other universities more adequately 
meet the needs of their students, or 
at least more effectively than ours 
currently does.

Med Students Should Speak Spanish 
It is surely a reasonable statement to say that medi-

cine in the United States has. number of problems. In 
fact, it is re.lly nol 50 uncommon for much of the 
public to use the word "criMI" when commentina on 
the state of health care delivery tod.y. 

The "problems" in the sYltem. al with any larle 
industry or corporation, are multi-f.ceted and inher-
ently difficult to eliminate ...... we.ll know, hi,h medi-
cal COlts and unequal accessibility in .rea. of poor I ru-
ral / minority popUlations continue to pose formidable 
challenges for the next generation of physicians. 

However, another diuatisfaction, concerninns the 
"quality" of the medical encounter, has more recently 
made' an increasing impact in medicine. Despite a 
growing awarenes. for the importance of lood commun-
ication in the doctor-patient relationship, _rrien 
continue to exist (limited time, legal problems, unreaJjs. 
tic expectations. etc.) In S.n DielO and. indeed. much 
of the Southwest, a much more basic obstacle fre-
quently limils the quality oft he medical encounter -
the ability of the practitioner to communicate with 
Spanish-speaking patients. With 100d communication 
an essential part of practicin"ood medicine, a course 
in medical Spani h should be considered an important 

part of medical ed .... ion in tbis part oftbt eoua.&f)'.

Hunter S. Thompson 
The Hellfire Club 

H OW long, 0 Lord, how long? Are these TV preachers all degenerates? Are they wallowing and whooping with harlots whenever they're not on camera? 
Are they all thieves and charlatans and whore-monger? 

Another ofthe shameless buggers got whacked . Jimmy Swaggart, 
a 52-year-old howler from Baton Rouge known in some quarters as 
the "Mid. Jagger of TV evangelism," got nailed in a nasty little sting 
operation down in New Orleans and was suspended from his $14-5 
million-a-yea r ministry for the same kind of sex crimes that his old 
rival Jim Bakker got busted for last year. 

There were those. in fact, who said it was Swaggart himself who 
hatched the plot to disgrace Bakker and have him labeled for life as a 
brutal sodomite and a flagrant embezzleer with a dope fiend for a 
wife and the IRS for a new partner. instead of Jesus. 

Then Swaggart, crazed by hubris , tried to take out yet another of 
his rivals - Preacher Marvin Gorman from New Orleans, by calling 
him a sot, a pervert and a dangerous child molester who couldn't help 
himself. 

So it was Gorman who turned up in possession of a set of malicious 
photographs of Big Jim slinking into one of those third-rate 
romance, low-rent "rendezvous"-style motels with a known prosti-
tute, or at least a woman of ill repute. 

It reminded a lot of people of the naked lunacy that blew Gary 
Hart out of the '88 presidefltial race. 

It was a shame, they said. But you know how these people are .. . 
The semen finally backs up into the brain; the eyes get too bright, and 
the synapses start fusing into each other. I nstead of secret love-nests, 
they begin strutting into the Holiday Inn and going to orgies on the 
outskirts of town. 

Not much has changed with these 'powermongers since Caligula's 
time. Sex and power have a long history offeeding on each other. In 
l8th-century England, the king and half his ministers were involved 
in a whole network of strange and violent sex clubs, whipping parlors 
and half-secret cults that embraced everything from Satan ism and 
human sacrifice to flagrant white slavery and public bestiality. 

I n the early years of that century, there were a large number of "Rakes' Clubs"in London, where the high point of most evenings was hitting the streets in a drunken, brainless frenzy and raping. 
beating and maiming every hum!!n being they could get their hands 
on. 

Burgo Partridge, in his classic "History of Orgies," said : "The 
Bucks and Gallants roamed the streets terrifying the elderly, beating 
up the watch (police), breaking windows, committing rape and 
sometimes even murder. Young girls were stood on their heads in the 
gutter, and elderly ladies popped into barrels and sent rolling down 
hills ... There were clubs called the Mohawks and the Man-Killers, 
which tried to out-do each other in a hideous game called 'tipping the 
Lion.' This consisted in crushing the nose, and simultaneously goug-
ing out the eyes of the victims unfortunate enough to be waylaid by 
them. They also carried a piece of apparatus for distending mouths 
and slitting ears." 

These were not 10wer-c1as thugs, as in "Clockwork Orange," but 
the sons of the aristocracy. There was no law forthem. Only the rich 
and powerful were allowed to carry swords or ride horses - which 
put the poor at a disadvantage when gangs of rich drunkards 
swooped down on them in some dim-lit street after midnight. ... 

That was the Golden Age of what they used to call "gentlemen's 
clubs"in London ... But it couldn't last. There were too many losers 
wandering around with their noses crushed, their eyes gouged O)Jt 
and their mouths so stretched that they could take in a whole canta-

Commentary 

Suicide 
Attempt 
Recovery 

I know this is an unusual piece 
to be printed in the schQol paper , 
but there is a need . 

Exactly last year, I attempted 
to kill myself. While I couldn't 
understand why people could be 
upset over my death, I realized 
that those who had lived in the 
residence dorms with me had 
actually been hurt and shocked 
by my actions.

OPINION 

PIPE DREAM 

Suicide is not a savory subject 
and is often avoided as a taboo in 
conver ation . Even after having 
exposure to my attempt , some 
close friends still erase that 
moment in time. Thi is why I am 
reaching out to you, because 
there is so much you can do. 
From just being in the room to 
seeking professional help for 
yourself or your friend , you can 
make a great difference. Being 
able to see warning signals such 
as long-term depression or over-
sleeping, could help someone out 
of a life threatening period . 

My friends at the time could 
not understand or read by sig-
mils, and that is normal. What 
was most surprising to me, how-
ever, was that after the event, 
these people were not afraid to 
come visit me in the hospital. 

People are afraid of being with a 
person who has tried to take his 
own life : It goes against all 
nature. Nonetheless,last year, in 
a time of crisis, these people 
overcame their fears and com-
forted me. 

is not to express my love and 
gratitude for them. I was forced 
to leave the campus housing after 
this incident and subsequently 
lost a great deal of contact and 
interaction with the people with 
whom I had developed close 
relationships. I never had all the 
time to say, "Thank you, I'm 
okay now and am working 
through it - with your support. 

lt must seem selfish for me to 
waste this space talking about 
my suicide attempt and the 
friends who helped me through 
it, but what is really more selfish See SUICIDE, pale 7

Pigs and 
Pedals 
Editor: 

What the hell is going on 
around here? I'm walking to class 
Friday morning and I see a group 
of students gathered around a 
bicyclist being handcuffed by a 
pig. 

So, what did the student do to 
warrant being handcuffed. taken 
to the station, and kept without 
being able to contact legal servi-
ces? He rode his bike on the 
walkway. Last year it was O . K. 
to ride your bike or skateboard 
wherever you wanted but thi s 
year all riders fun the ri sk of 
being tackled by a pig or CSO, 
thrown to the ground and 
charged with assaulting an officer 
or resisting arrest . What's next , 
machine- gun emplacements 
along restricted walkways, cattle 
guards to trap the wheels of 
unsuspecting riders (or wheel-
chairs) ... 

Next time ride faster and tuck 
in to dodge the bullets.

loupe and still make idle co nver-
sa tion in a pub. Public opinion 
turned o n the "wild boys." and 
their clubs were bani hed . 

By the second half of the century, there was a whole new focus for the gentle-
men's clubs the wor hip of sex 
and extravagant public deca-
de nce. This was the time of the 
infamous Hellfire C lub, which 
included among its inner circle 
th e Prince of Wales, the Lord 
Mayor of London , Benjamin 
Franklin, the crazed Earl of 
Sandwich, the monstrous Earl of 
Bute. then prime minister of 
England . 

These people didn 't fool 
around. They raised the orgy to 
an art form unknown si nce 
Caligula or even the fiendish 
Mongol hordes ofGenghis Khan, 
who begat a long line of rapists 
and treacherous sex maniacs who 
were said to lament the fact that 
the human body had so few ori-
fices to penetrate that they were 
forced to create new ones with 
their own daggers in order that 
the whole clan could swarm on a 
victim at once. 

These were no amateur degen-
erates, like the ones we sneer at 
today. They put the whole Brit-
i h Empire on the road to ruin , 
and thought nothing of it - nor 
cared, for that matter. . . When 
the famous Englis h navigator. 
Ca p\. Coo k, se nt word ba ck to 
London that he had Hawa ii and 
all of Polynesia in the pa lm of his 
hand if o nly Sandwich would 
a uthorize a new rna t for his 
cri ppled flagship the earl 
ignored the request. A few weeks 
lat er, Cap\. Coo k was murdered 
by angry natives - but Sandwich 
neve r noticed . 

So much for Empire. These 
boys liked the ir orgie, and 
nothing was going to interfere. 
These were gia nts. They had 
standard s - not like these 
Whimpering mashers who keep 
fouling our headlines today. 

Maybe Alphonse Karr was 
wrong.

And, with the loss of funding, we 
will lose this elective . This would 
be disa terous. With years of 
organiz.ation already completed , 
high student interest (many more 
students sign up than can tak e 
the course), an excellent instruc-
tor, and the obvious utility for 
the content, it would be an aca-
demic, social, and cultural mis-

take to lose th is course at UCS D. I 
I n a region of the country 

whe re projections have estimated

of up to 50 percent over the next 
50 years, now is the time to

Nothing befo re has ever touched

Pugwash U.S.A.: Bringing it all back home 
By LAURA KNAPP 
SUlff Wriur 

L ast weekend the organiza lion Student Pugwa h U.S.A. recognized its tenth 
anniver ary by returning to . v 
UCS 0 where it originally started 
to hold a weekend-long board 
meeting. Student Pugwa h wa 
started at UCSD in 1978 by Jef-
frey Leifer, then A.S. president. 
Today, Leifer is chairman ofthe 
board of Student Pugwash . 

tudent Pugwa h is a national 
organization that holds confer-
ences in an effort to educate 
students on scientific and tech-
nological issues that affect 
today's society. It is an organi-
zation that tries to get students 
to think about the ethical im-
plications of their work . 

The organization started after 
Leifer became the first student to 
attend the International Pugwa h 
Conference held in Munich in 
1977. These conferences were 
started in 1957 by Albert Ein-
stein and Bertrand Russel. who 
held their first conference in 

"[We] don't pretend 
we have the answers 
... [but we're in] a bet-
ter position to ask ques-
tions ." 

-Jeffrey Leifer 

Pugwash, Nova Scotia. The main 
focus of International Pugwash 
is the discussion of nuclear arms 
by scientists around the world . 

After attending the Munich 
conference, Leifer decided he 
wanted to expand on this issue 
and open the door for student 
involvement, so he started Stu-
dent Pugwash at UCSD. His 
goal was not only .to address the 
nuclear arms issue but also to 
focus on other issues dealing 
with ethics and values in science 
and techonolgy . Leifer said he 

"hoped to show the broader pub-
lic that young people can be 
articulate and thoughtful." He 
also wanted to "foster a more 
' ocially re ponsible population 
down the road who will have 
thought through the issue ." 

In order to do this, Leifer 
engaged the help of many on 
UCSO's faculty . People such as 
Dr. Roger Revelle, founder of 
Revelle College; Dr. Clifford 
Grobstein. Professor Emeritus; 
Dr. Sandford Lakoff, political 
cience professor; and Dr. Her-

bert York, director of the In ti-
tute for Global Conflict and 
Cooperation (IGCC) actively 
participated in the creation of 
Pugwash and are still involved 
today. 

Student Pugwash addresses a 
broad pectrum of issues such as: 
nuclear weapons, bio technology 
and genetic engineering, compu-
ters, health concern", resource 
use, environmental issues, and 
international development. 
Pugwash doesn't take a specific 
position on an issue but wants to 
address all perspective . "[We] 
don't pretend we have the an-
swers ... [but we're in] a better 
position to ask the questions," 
Leifer said. 

Michael Berger, also a former 
politica 1 science major at UCSD, 
is now a member of the board of 
directors of P·Jgwash . Berger also 
works for the Congressional 
Budget Office in WaShington, 
D.C. , and held the third Student 
Pugwash conference. He says 
the conferences are full of energy 
and excitement and it gives peo-
ple a new community of peers 
and optimism. "[Conferences] 
give bright students a chance to 
sit and talk with people who 
have hands-on experience, and 
they love it ," Berger said. 

Leifer and Berger both stressed 
the impact that UCSD has had 
on Student Pugwash. Berger said, 
"UC San Diego has been impor-
tant to the organization. II He felt 
that a main factor in the success 
of Pugwash was the "encour-
agement that Jeff [Leifer] re-

Aside from not having to

alternate course . 

Of the 3,500 seniors ex-

were there only 1,825 students 
who actually used it? Some 
students were intimidated by 
the lengthy in tructions. Web,

went on to say that it was "very

Navy sinks Tritons 
in three straight sets 

UCSD can't find streak; 
loses 15-11, 15-2, 15-9 

By BRIAN ITOW 
Stfljf Writer 

The volleyball game Tuesday 
night between UCSD and Navy 
matched two teams of very equal 
strength. Tied for seventeenth in 
the nation, the two followed 
almost parallel course . Both 
teams has lost two straight 
matches coming in. For each, the 
first loss was a heartbreaker to a 
top 10 team and the second was a 
big letdown. 

UCSD (5-14) fell 3-2 to San 
Diego State and 3-1 to CSU 
Northridge in two close matches 
while Navy (16-12) was defeated 
3-0 in a tight match with Long 
Beach State and then was 
trounced 3-0 by Loyola- Mary-
mount. So the question was : 
which team would enter the 
match ready to play? 

The answer: Navy. and it was 
no contest. While UCSD still 
seemed flat from its loss to 
SDSU , Navy came in fired up 
and ready to avenge their trounc-
ingat Loyola . They did just that , 
winning IS-II , 15-12, 15-9. 

While the Tritons played them 

clo e for a while in each of the 
three games, the Midshipmen 
were able to pull away by domi-
nating the middle game. Led by 
Chad Watson's 17 kills , Navy 
converted 34 percent of its 
attempts en route to their easy 
3-0 victory. 

UCSD Coach Digger Graybill 
was obviously disappointed by 
the loss. When asked to assess 
the match, he stated , "They 
played well ... but we played ter-
rible. This is really discouraging. 
They controlled the middle game. 
We weren't effective blocking .. . 
We made them look much better 
than they really are." 

Navy Coach Pat Nichols felt 
that emotion - or lack of it -
was the key to the match. "We've 
been kind of down lately but we 
came in here with a vengeance. 
UCSD , on the other hand , 
seemed to be down emotionally; 
I think thai had an effect on the 
outcome." 

Graybill agreed, "Navy seemed 
fired up. They wanted the match 
more than we did . That hasn't 
been the case all season, but it 
was tonight. We just weren't 
ready to play." 10 Sean Hudson spikes a shot against Navy. John Lim tries to fake out his Navy opponents. 

Women's softball runs over Oxy-twice 
By JONATHAN SCHRETER 
Sports Editor 

The UC San. Diego Tritons 
women's softball team didn't 
waste much time disposing of 
their latest victi ms, Occidental 
College, Tuesday afternoon at 
the Jewish Community Center. 

In fact, the Tritons (13-3) 
managed to get both games of 
the double header called after 
four-and-a-half innings with the 
enforcement of the NCAA 10-
run rule. That is, by the bottom 
of the fifth inning, UCSD had 
amassed scores of 12-0 and 16-1, 
to send the Tigers crawling back 
to Los Angeles. 

In the first game, Patti Hurtt 
(6-2) allowed only four hits 
through her five innings, without 
a runner getting farther than 

Commentary-

second. Hurtt struck out four 
and walked none in her first shut 
out of the season. 

Offensively, the Tritons racked 
up seven hits and capitalized on 
eight walks to earn their 12 runs. 
UCSD batted around the order 
in the second inning, scoring five 
runs. The Tritons also stole six 
bases against Occidental's Anna 
Marie Bonnett (1-4). The Tigers 
didn't do much to help their 
cause, committing eight errors. 
three by the pitCher Bonnett. 

In the second game, despite 
one mistake, Triton Stacy Sasaki 
was unstoppable. With five strike 
outs and walking only one, 
Sasaki (7-1) shut down the side 
in order for three of the five 
innings - four if you don't count 
the blast by Occidental's Perry to 
left-centerfield in the top of the 

second, her first and the only hit 
in the game for the Tigers. 

The Tritons batted around in 
the second inning again, this 
time scoring 10 runs on the six 
hits and four errors. Through the 
second game, despite scoring 15 
runs, the Tritons could only 
manage nine hits, including a 
two-run double by Dani Good-
lett in the third. The Tritons did 
throw eight walks in the second 
game, which disturbed head 
coach Lin Adams. 

"[Occidental] didn't give us 
anything to hit. They are one of 
the weaker teams we play and 
just couldn't give us a good 
game," Adams said. 

Bonnett started the second 
game as well for the Tigers but 
couldn't find her mark. Cathy 
Palk replaced Bonnett in the 

bottom of the fourth but her 
gopher balls simply led to three 
walks in her two innings. 

"We've come a long way," said 
co-head coach of the Tritons 
Lisa Bassi. "We're hitting the 
ball well . That has helped us to 
play our opponents tough or 
dominate the game." 

Occidental may not have 
proved themselves to be much 
competition for the Tritons, but 
the road to success for UCSD 
will not get any easier. 

The Tritons play h-ost to--;&'zl1sa 
Pacific on Thursday at 2 pm at 
the Jewish Community Center. 
That will be their final game 
before spring break . The Tritons 
will begin the second half of the 
season on Match 30 against 
Augsberg, MN in San Diego. 

"Augsberg has been a con-
sistent participant in the nation-
al tournament so it'l be a good, 
tough game," Bassi said . 

The Tritons will then partici-
pate in an open division tourna-
ment at CSU Hayward where 
UCSD will be able to try their 
skills against Division I and II 
teams. The way this team has 
been playing, they will definitely 
be a force to be reckoned with. 
As for Nationals, coach Adams 
wants to take it one step at a 
time. 

"Right now we're just looking 
to qualify for Regionals," Adams 
said. 

At 13-3 halfway through the 
season and looking strong, Re-
gionals is not just a distant 
dream. (Q) 

An Olympic idea for an old cliche 
~------------~ 

By MARC LEVINE 
Staff Writer 

You know, there's an old cliche 
that floats around sports fan s 
and journalists, alike. It goes 
something like this : Last night I 
went to a boxing match and a 
hockey game broke out. Of 
course, the jab here is intended 
to criticize hockey for its ex-
cessive violence. 

Well , now that the 1988 Winter 
Olympics are officially over, 
there may soon be a new cliche to 
start making its rounds among 
the sports afficiandados in our 
country. It goes something like 
this : Last night I wa~ watching 
commercials and a part of the 
Olymipics broke out. Of cou rse, 

the jab here is intended to criti-
cize A BC for its excess vie inter-
ruptions. 

Without a doubt , this year's 
Olympic games were consistently 
interrupted by one ad after 
another. Time and time again , 
portions of certain events were 
a bruptly cut off in order to make 
room for sponsored messages. 
Indeed, it will be quite some time 
before hostile critics stop per-
secuting ABC's coverage of the 
Winter Games. It just wouldn't 
be fair to let them get away with 
uch an injustice. 

The United States won ix 
medals this year and remains to 
be the only country, thus far, to 
have won a gold medal in every 

Winter Olympics since 1924. Yet , 
1988 appears to be a major 
disappointment. Debi Thomas 
se ttled for a bronze in figure 
skating. Our hockey team could 
not play defense, and our skiers 
were all but non-existent. 

So what, then, if A BC showed 
a few more commercials than 
anticipated . Would the showing 
of less commercials have helped 
our athletes win more medals? 
It 's highly unlikely. Did the home 
viewers aClUally watch these 
commercials or did they become 
more familiar with their remote 
control and investigate other 
channel for more tati fying 
entertainment? 

The point being i that had the 

United States ' won as many 
medals as the Soviet Union or 
East Germany, a more relieved 
and content audience would have 
eased up on their criticisms of 
excessive advertising. If the U.S. 
team had more to show for its 
effort , explicitly a higher medal 
count (as if that is the only 
barometer the public uses to 
mea ure effort). the anger felt 
toward ABC would have dissi-
pated . Taking out frustrated 
pride on a network seemed to be 
their year's solution for disap-
pointed fans . 

Perhaps the viewers should 
have criticized ABC for its analy-
si and commentating of the 
event but , that is another story.

UCSD finished in a four-way 
tie with a 73. 

"We had to best CSU San 
Bernardino here, [to remain 
in contention for the Nation-
als], and we did," head coach 
Mike Wydra said . 

Other top scores for UCSD 
were entered by Bob Knee 
and Mike Reinhardt who both 
shot a 75 on the day.

As the lead inger ran his 
hand through his viv id hair , 
the dye rubbed off and stained 
hi s fin gc rs fuchsia . W ith his 
long colored hair, James (Jay) 
Aston doesn' t look much like 
his brother Michae l who to-
gether fo rm Gene Loves Jeze-
bel , curre ntly o n tour to 
promote their latest album, 
" The House of Do lls." Jay's 
hair which is as maroo n as a 
pomegranatc, symbolizes the 
richness , the passio n and the 
flamboyance of the band that 
played Bing Crosby Hall last 
Thursday night. 

Flesh for Lou Lou warmed-
up the yo ung crowd , playing 
ten songs including, " Rest-
less," "Crazy Without You," 
"Sleeping Dogs" and ending 
with their romantic hit, "Post-
cards from Paradise." Gene 
Loves Jezebel played longer , 
offering the audience twelve 
songs and an encore, half of 
which were from their latest 
album including: " Gorgeous, " 
"Set Me Free, It "Suspicion," 
"Every Door," "20 Khz" and 
the finale, "The Motion of 
Love." 

Before the show, Jay and 
Michael Aston talked freely 
about their new album. "Well , 
we spent eight months think-
ing about, writing and pro-
ducing this album and we feel 

it's the best album we've ever 
made. W e are very proud . W e 
are expecting it to do great 
things for Gene Loves Jezebel. 
Hopefully "The House of 
Dolls" will mean that we can 
play to larger and greater 
audiences ... 

Hopefully this transition 
will happen soon for the band, 
so they will no longer have to 
play in terrible sound traps 
like Bing Crosby Hall, which 
echoes because of its cave-like 
design . But the dynamic thea-
trical performance of Gene 
Loves Jezebel was in stark 
contrast to the Hall 's below-
par sound quality . 

Michael came in first in a 
mystical cloud of blue and 
maroon smoke while Jay made 
his entrance without the ki-
ne tic energy o f his brother. 
The two pair up as dual lead 
singers, each flamboyant in 
his own way. 

Michael is more active , he 
runs , k icks and does a lot of 
arm moti o ns, wh ich were 
mime-like at times. Though 
Mic hael 's b lo nd hair, high 
cheek bones and red-colored 
lips gave him a feminine ap-
pearance, his body is very 
masculine. He went topless 
through half of the perfor-
mance, while the other half 
was spent peeling off clothes 
while crawling down the ramp 
from the cat walk which was 

of their set. 

Jay, the fuchsia man, plays 
guitar while singing, wh ich 
inhibits his movement. Al-
though not as much of a dancer 
as his brother, he was the 
more elaborate dresser . He 
was decked out in a maroon, 
torn up shirt with extensions 
o f material t ied to his wrist to 
match his fuchsia hair . The 
shirt matched his velvet and 
satin patchwork pants creating 
the image of a performer fro m 
the Renaissance. 

Their perfo rmance style, 
like their name, is very pro-
vocative and unique. When 
the brothers were asked to 
explain their unusual name, 
M ichael responded , " It was 
Jay's idea, we wanted to get 
something that 's very original 
- so~thing slightly pr9vo-
cative. Jay had a nickname o f 
Jezebel because he is kinda this 
fl amboyant figure, very o ut 
going. They call me Gene, fo r 
God knows what reasons and 
it kinda linked well, Gene 
Loves Jezebel, you know it 
was just a funny thing. So I 
can't really answer that ques-
tion, its always kinda an e m-
barrassing questio n for me , 
but I do like the name despite 
the difficulty explaining it." 

Their intriguing name has a 
history, but the ba nd 's allur-
ing style of music seems to be 
very spontaneous , as Jay and 
Mi ch ae l continued, " W e 
haven't got any cut and d ry 

influe nces whatsoever . But 
musically fo r a band that uses 
guitars and basic rock bass, I 
think we are a lo t more diverse, 
and we actuall y take it further 
than a lo t of our contempor-
aries." Their sound is interest-
ing; it has the consrant deep 
throbbing of rock. Jay and 
Michael's voices blend into 
the lyrics that extends the 
rock pulse into a smooth , 
sultr y ye t conte m pora ry 
sound. 

Their band's sound is always 
changing and evolving. T hey 
recorded their last two albums, 
(four in all ) under Geffen 
Records . Peter W alsh pro-
d uced all cuts o n " The Ho use 
of Do lls" album except fo r 
" The Motion of Love" and 
"Suspicion," wh ich were pro-
duced by Jimmy Iovine. The 
band fro m W ales explains the 
intriguing album title. "It's a 
kind of bordello, a haven 
asylum, an escape. All the 
people we sing about in the 
songs are people we run into, 
but it's almost an imaginary 
hou e too, a theatre with a 
ci rcus element." Jay adds, 
"That's what the album cover 
says, full of bright colors, 
musky, ensual, atmospheric, 
with the band atiated in the 
backgroup; this i heaven." 

The name Jezebel, their 
dres , and erotlc songs like 
"Up There," wht(h IS abollt 

good sex, seem to create a very 
passionate image of the band. 
One of the members explains 
the attitude as, " It's because 
we are good lovers. I am the 
wo rst singe r but the' best 
lover!" That could be a part o f 
their se nsuali ty, as we ll as the 
passion that stems fro m thei r 
pe rfo rmance. Jay feels. " Bei ng 
on stage is the most exciting 
th ing. We are a live force." 
Michael adds, " We're d iffe r-
en t tha n other rock 'n ' roll 
bands; we' re a good experience 
for the senses." 

But what arouses listener's 
emotion is the actual lyrics of 
the songs and their simplistic 
honesty . Jay explains, "We 
never think, 'now we have got 
to write a hit single.' W e just 
write, then it co mes out. 
\Vhl'n we write the son'g, we 
write like thiS because it' the 
way we believe In and we 
don't think of an audience. 
The c are songs that plea I.' us, 
that an~ Jone In a way that 
moves us. 0, if nothing elsl', 
they are vt'ry honest statt'-
ments ." 

As Jay talks about the ong 
thar recl'ives the mo t air-plllY, 
"The Motion of Love," he 
givesinsightonthephtlo ophy 
of the band. "We're not 
nihill ts . We're ptimi t . 
This song is a very p sitive 
tatmcnt. It 's what Gene Love 

Jezebd i all about."

The play, "The Prince of 
Homburg," was once banned 
from performance in Germany 
because of its criticism of the 
Pruss ian monarchy's rule. This 
mythic and passionate drama 
will be staged at UCSD's 
Mandell Weiss Center for the 
Performing Arts tonight 
through Sunday. Curtain time 
will be 8 pm tonight through 
Saturday and 7 pm on Sunday. 
The dream element is an 
important component of the 
play, allowing the characters 
to resolve problems on the 
unconscious level.

"Noises Off" is a three-act 

play within a play. This farce 
of non-stop hilarity inter-
twines the lives of the off-

the on-stage characters to 
produce a mishmash of lines, 
feelings and meaning. First 
performed at the Savoy Thea-

Chicken eats 
by robert leone 

hiatus writer 

Chicken can be prepared in 
so many different ways. The 
flavor is delicate but strong 
enough to support so many 
flavors and sauces and con-
diments. It's also cheap. 

The Teriyaki House at the 
University Towne Centre food 
mall (right above the skating 
rink) seems to subsist on the 
$1.99 chicken bowl. trs cus-
tomers order that dish more 

than all the others combined. 
For your money you get a 
white styrofoam bowl filled 
three quarters with rice, a few 
pickled vegetables with a sprig 
of broccoli, and six or eight 
strips of cooked skinless and 
boneless chicken meat. This is 
topped' with a thick teriyaki 
sauce. 

It isn't a great meal. but for 
the price it's tough to beat. 
The meat is fairly good, not 
some pressed construct meant

Switch Channels 

by peter melsrobian 
newl editor 

"It's hard to believe that 
some people actually like that 
movie." 

So said my moviegoing 
companion after we were vis-
ually and aurally assaulted by 
the comedy "Switching Chan-
nels," an exrremely pale spawn 
of "Broadcast News." While 
the former is actuallv based on 
Ben Hecht and Charles Mac-
Arthur's play "The Front 
Page, " it comes off as an ill-
conceived and poorly-created 
attempt to cash in on the 
popularity of last year's hit 
movie. 

Burr Reynolds stars in "Swl[chinR 
Channels." 

The gaudy music played 
during the opening scenes 
gives a clue as to the tone of 
the movie, in which every 
scene is overacted (and poorly 
acted at that). and none of the 
characters are developed 
beyond flesh less, one-dimen-
sional caricatures. 

Christopher Reeve is hope-
lessly miscast as Blaine Bing-
ham, a pompous, childish, and 
wealthy manufacturer of ath-
letic equipment who sweeps 
anchorwoman/ace reporter 
Christy Colleran (Kathleen 
Turner) off her feet wh ile she 
is vacationing in Canada . 

The attemps at slapstick 
comedy are almost sad, and 
while Blaine is certainly a fine-
looking fellow, looks only get 
you so far, and its hard to 
believe that a supposedly 
mature, intelligent woman like 
Christy would fall for this 
idiot. 

But, fall for him she does, 
and when she returns 'to Satel-
lite News Network she tells 
ex-husband and station boss 
John L. Sullivan IV (Burt 
Reynolds) that she's through 
with the news business. and is 
going off to New York with 
Blaine to get married, have 
"lots of babies," and host 

400/0-60% 
OFF 
MARCH 14 - 18 
9:00AM - 4:00PM 

"A.M. Manhattan." However, 
Sullivan. a.k .a. Sully, con-
vinces her to stay for one last 
story, th~ execution of a mur-
derer named Roscoe whose 
life Christy believes should be 
spared because the man he 
killed was a drug dealer 're-
sponsible' for Roscoe's son's 
death from a drug overdose. 

Besides its irritatingly 
preachy anti-drug tone, the 
movie suffers from an almost 
total lack of realism (holes in 
the script are big enough to 
drive a truck through) and 
general unfunniness. The at-
tempts at drama, such as when 

Chri~ty interviews Roscoe a 
few hours before his scheduled 
execution, are almost embar-
rassingly bad, and the anti-
septic, 'sitcom' look of all the 
sets makes you wonder if the 
movie's creators have ever 
been to a real TV station. 

A final problem is the 
almost laughable portrayal of 
a "journnalist" by Turner. Her 
character's level of objectivity 
may best be described as nil. 
as she assures Roscoe that he 
does not deserve to be exe-
cuted, and she will do every-
thing she can to have the 
sentence commuted. 

An admirable sentiment, to 
be sure, but not one that 
should be expressed by the 
impartial chronicler a jour-
nalist should be. Also. calling 

the governor an "ass" and 
"spineless," as truthful as it 
may be, hardly fits within 
acceptable etiquette for an 
anchor while she is reading the 
news. 

If all this sounds like nit-
picking, well, it isn't. What 
could have been an entertain-

After over 20 years of re-
cording and performing before 
millions of fans. the Kinks 
have returned with their latest 
offering. another live album 
entitled. "Live - The Road." 

Covering materi al based pri-
m arily on their la t few 
albu ms. "Live - The Road." 
is a predictable record with a 
few highs and a more pro-
minent number of lows. 

When referring to the 
Kinks. one most often recall 
such classics as "Lola ." " Yo u 

Really Got Me." and " All Day 
and All of the Night ." Not 
only does one reme~ber those 
songs for thei r creativity and 
inventiveness. but also for 
thei r appealing and catchy 
melodies. Over the last decade 
the Kinks have attempted to 
cont inue that hard-driving 
origi nality that established 
them as o ne of the best rock 
and roll ba nds of all time. 
Though the material theY've 

recently produced pales in 
ompariso n. urpri ingly the 

Kinks have managed to main-
tain a substantial amount of 
respect from fans and ritics 
alike. 

When the Kinks released 
their first live album. "One 
For The Road" in 1980. it 
symbolized the climax of the 
band's caree r . highlighting 
their most memorable songs. 
"One For The Road" also 

aptured the vivacity and 
energy that the Kinks only 
reveal in live performances. 
Having gaineJ a reputation 
ea rly on as an extremely enter-
tai ning band. "One For The 
Road" allowed millions offans 
who had never seen a live

" Lola" became a trademark of 
the band. Regarded as o ne of 
the best live albums ever re-
corded. "One For The Road" 

chronicled a mass of Kiriks 
work that stretched from the 
mid-sixties through the seven-
ties. 

The eightie~ brought a new 
and more contemporary 
sound from the Kinks. Kicking 
in hard with powerful and 
socially conscious, "Give The 
People What They Want." 
the Kinks maintained their 
position as rock legends

Kinks 
Continued from pale .. 
amongst long time fans while 
simultaneously picking up a 
whole new generation of fol -
lowers . 

Following the success of 
"Give The People What They 
Want ," the Kinks changed 
pace and produced the more 
subtle and compassionate 
album , " Come Dancing." The 
nostalgic title track and the 
album as a whole offended the 
hard rock Kinks fanatics, ap-
pealing toa more mainstream, 
older audience . 

By the time their next 
album, "Word of Mouth" was 
released, the Kinks had man-
aged to alienate most of their 
long-time fans on their quest 
for a new mqre popularly 

accepted sound . As a result, 
,. Word of Mouth," consisting 
of a collection of empty and 
lifeless songs was met with 
little success. 

Following "Word of 
Mouth." the Kinks released a 
c onceptual album called 
" Think Visual." "Think 
Visual" painted a bleak picture 
of the media, inspired pri-
marily by singer Ray Davies' 
experimentation in motion 
pictures. Spawning no real 
hits, "Think Visual" vanished 
with the least praise of any 
Kinks albums in years. 

It is because of the lack of 
substantial material on the 
latter albums that "Live -
The Road" is similarly weak 
and only sparsely notable . 

The title and only studio 
recorded song, "The Road" is 
a semi -autobiographical 

glimpse into the band's his-
tory. Similar in style to such 
Kink's classics as, "Super-
man" and "Celluloid Heroes." 
"The Road" is a gentle and 
stirring song that sets a positive 
tone that is ruined by a poor 
choice of material which fol-
lows it. 

By including extensive ma-
terial from "Think Visual" 
and "Word of Mouth," the 
album forces the same un-
appreciated material upon the 
listener. Not only is the ma-
terial weak, but the live per-
formances do nothing to en-
hance it. The live versions 
of "Lost and Found" and 
"Think Visual" might as well 
be studio recordings due to 
their lack of enthusiasm and 
crowd reaction. 

"Live - The Road" also 
manages to ruin several of the 

respected Kinks songs. One of 
the few notable songs on this 
album that the Kinks have 
produced in the last few years, 
"Living On A Thin Line" is 
mangled into a lifeless, boring 
rendition of an otherwise 
pleasant song. 

After a string of less than 
adequate albums following a 
career of classics, one has to 
wish the Kinks would stop 
making new music and just 
allow us to remember them 
for their earlier material. With 
"Li ve - The Road" one 
would hope that the Kinks 
would call it quits, but the 
band insists that it will con-
tinue . With this attitude, it is 
only a matter of time before 
we remember the Kinks not 
for classics like, "Lola," but 
for inferior material such as, 
"Live - The Road."

Chicken 
Continued from page 2 
for Jeep frying, as nuggets. 
Servi e is usually quite fast. 

Saffron Thai Grilled Chick-
en is further away than UTe. 
It' s a storefront on India 
Street, about 100 feet north of 
EI Indio, near the intersec tion 
of India and Washington . 
Racks of whole chickens are 
grilled, then the birds are cut 
into large pieces. Two pieces 
of grilled chicken go for $3.39, 
accompanied by an aromatic 
rice (cooked in weak jasmine 
tea), a sweet Cambodian salad, 
and a dipping sauce. 

These two pieces, which are 
not skinless or boneless, make 
a filling meal. A whole chicken 
with rice, salad, and two sauces 
cost $8.79. Four wings or two 
drumsticks from these birds, 
with the same rice, salad, and 
sauce accompaniment go for 
$2.89. They also have a sub-
stantial chicken salad for 
$3.99. 

The diner and lunch counter 
are currently flying trendily 
high on nostalgia-fueled busi-
ness, but the Chicken Pie Shop 
at the corner of Fifth Avenue 
and Robinson Avenue in Hill-
crest is not some fashionable 
creation like the Hard Rock 
Cafe. The restaurant will cele-
brate its 50th anniversary on 
May 12. 

No, the Chicken Pie Shop 
with its worn vinyl booths is a 
true exemplar of the lunch 
counter, of unchained fast 
food for the working man, 
woman, or student. The high-
est price on the menu is $5.95, 
for a New York Steak . No 
other menu item goes over $4. 
The specialty of the house, the 
mostly white meat chicken 
(and turkey) pie, costs about 
$1.50. 

If you desire a better bal-
anced meal, the pie with cole-
slaw, roll, and butter will only 
set you back $2.25 . For a meal 
of this size, it's a good deal. 
The rolls are superb, but the 
coleslaw is so-so. If you don't 
like chicken pie, they have 
other items on the menu as 
well. 

By no means does this 
exhaust the search for low-
priced chicken in San Diego. 
But it gives an interesting 
selection the next time you 
want some poultry and don't 
want to cook it yourself.
