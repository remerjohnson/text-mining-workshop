IRANI': UCSD received $3 million to solve accident-related traffic problems 

Stmf~ 

The Irwin and Joan Jacobs 
School of Engineering received 
a $3 million research award 
from CaITrans and the state of 
California to reduce urban tra.f-
ftc congestion that costs the 
government and motorists over 
$100 billion per year in lost pro-
ductivity, wasted fuel and pol-
lution. 

The California Department 
of Transportation reports that 

- freeway congestion costs the 
dty of Los Angeles alone over 
$10 billion annuaUy, and that 

traffic congestion costs are 
highest in California. Caltrans 
expects congestion problems, 
along with the population, to 
double by 2040. 

Mohan Trivedi, professor of 
electrical and computer engi-
neering at the Jacobs School of 
Engineering, heads the research 
project, titled Autonomous 
Transportation Agents for On-
Scene Networked Incident 
Management. 

Trivedi said the group of 
students, research associates 
and faculty members from 
UCSD and UC Santa Barbara 
are striving to create a powerful 

and integrated traffic incident 
detection, monitoring and 
recovery system that will 
reduce congestion by deploy-
ing robotic agents when traffic-
causing incidents occur. 

Cal trans defines traffic-caus-
ing incidents as any restriction 
of the free movement of traffic 
or an event that causes block-
age of traffic lanes. A stalled 
vehicle, accidents, debris and 
chemical spills are all examples 
of traffic-causlng incidents that 
occur frequently on freeways.

lAs May 
Strike 
Once Again 
CONTRACT: UAW ays 
it may hold strike vote if 
negotiation break down 
By VINCENT GRAGNANI 
News Editor 

Over six months after voting 
for union representation, teaching 
as istants are still negohating 
with the University of California 
for a contract and may be pursu-
ing another system-wide trike if 
talks break down. 

The university and the union 
have been at the bargaining table 
since last summer. The initial goal 
of bargaining, according to the 
union, was to have a contract 
negotiated by the end of 1999 . 

Negotiations, however, are 
still underway. Both sides met 
last Friday and are scheduled to 
meet again this Friday. 

The union released a sta te-
ment Tuesday saying that there 
are still Significant differences in 
negotiations between the univer-
sity and the union. It added that 
while the union is eagerly await-
ing the rest of the university's 
offer on Friday, it is also proceed-
ing with a strike vote later this 
month to keep pressu.re on the 
university. 

Brad Hayward, a spokesper-
son for the university, said the 
union and the university met last 
Friday and will meet again this 
Friday in hope of reaching an 
agreement. 

"We are continuing to work 
with the UAW and we hope to 
reach an agreement in a timely 
manner," he said. "We want to 
achieve a contract that is in the 
best interest of both the students 
and the university. We know we

·Reflectlons on the New Century' 

History professor David Gutierrez will give a 
speech entitled • Diversity, Demography and 
California's Future: Reflections on the New Century, ' 
Thursday at 7 p.m. in the Copley AuditOrium of the 
Institute of the Americas. 

Gutierrez will explore the future implications of the 
tremendous changes California has experienced over 
the past quarter century as a result of mass migration 
and economic integration. He will explain how socI-
ety's view of the assimilation of Immigrants' econom-
ic, social, political and cultlJral behaviors is more suit-
ed to the beginning of the 20th century rather than the 
21st century. He will suggest possible reasons for our 
society's inability to effectively assimilate immigrants. 
and how it might best ensure optimal modes of inte-
gration in the future. 

Gutierrez was instrumental in establishing a Cross 
Cultural Center on campus and Integrating the 
"Diversity" segment Into Thurgood Marshall College's 
required "Dimensions of Culture' course series. He 
also received a UCSD Faculty Senate Research Grant 
for his book project, "Immigration. Ethnic Activism and 
the Nation: The Debate Over Citizenship in recent 

American History,' and the 1997 Westem History 
Association's ~ __ ........ __ 

Southwest.' In 
addition, Gutierrez was awarded the 1995 Academic 
Senate Distinguished Teaching Award. 

The lecture will be hosted by Muir Provost Pat 
Ledden. A reception will follow. This event is free and 
open to the public. Seating is limited.

He added that the

have freeways open in approxi-

it takes over 25 minutes for the

which creates massive congestion 
that sometimes lasts for hours.

"Every situation is dlffen:mt,

will find a body in the middle of

progress on the prototypes for the

TV Networks Bought Off By 
Overzealous White House 

For ~nyone who is sick of watching annoying anti-
drug epI~odes of popular television shows, it comes as 
no surpnse that studio executives are getting paid off 
to produce these very initating shows. 

Last month, the online magazine Salon.com broke 
the story that the White House Office of National 
~rug .Control Policy provides enormous financial 
mcenllves for TV programmers to push anti-dru 

. h ' g 
messages m t elr plots. The office's edits have earned 
networks at least $25 million in the past year a d 
half. n a 

Yesterday, television executives testified before the 
House of Representatives' Committee on Commerce 
that they did. not pander to the U.S. government's anti-
d~g camp3Jgn by allowing ONDCP officials to pre_ 
vIew and ch~nge popular TV shows containing anti-
drug themes m exchange for cash incentives. 

Perhaps the network executives who testified 
before C~ngress don.'t quite understand what's going 
on at therr own statlOns, or are afraid to admit that 
they got caught wi~ thei~ hands in the cookie jar. 

Clearly, somethlOg IS amiss here. Salon.com 
,~ ncovered ~ ~pis~e of the now-canceled WB show 

S~art Guy 10 whIch ONDCP virtually rewrote the 
scnpt. ?NDCP asked producers to change the origi- . 
nal scnpt's portraya~ of two substance-abusing kids 
at a party. The two kids were initially depicted as hip 
and cool, but after ONDCP's input they were por_ 

!ra~ed a~ losers and locked in a utility room for the

Nev~rthe!ess, it is unfair to blame only ONDCP 
~or de~lgratlng TV even further; part of the problem 
lies with the network executives who bought into 
~~CP's plan. It is time for the networks to stop 
kISSing up to ONDCP and to get back to what they 
are best at - churning out shows be th

UCSD Student Health Service. Has Programs For Eating Disorders 
Editor: 

In her article titled, "Social 
pressures and expectations have 
young girls dying to be th.in" 
("The Editor's Soapbox," Jan. 20), 
Alison Norris expressed her opin-
ions about eating disorders on 
campus. I would like to thank 
Alison for bringing attention to 
this important issue. As a dietitian 
at UCSD, I want to update 
GJUJrdian readers about the preva-
lence of eating disorders, and talk 
about the resources available to 
students who are suffering. 

too late. 
Next week (Feb. 14-19) is 

Eating Disorder Awareness Week . 
Look for information tables on 
Library Walk on Monday, Tuesday 
and Friday. In addition, Doris 
Smeltzer, whose daughter lost her 
battle with an eating disorder last 
summer, will be speaking at the 
International Center Lounge from 
2:30 f.m. to 4 p.m. on Thursday, 
Feb. 7. This should be a powerful 
presentation. We hope to see 
everyone there. 

Eating disorders are a threat to 
our community. By raising aware-
ness and reaching out to those in 
need, we can make a difference.

Spirit NI_ 
Deserved CoV ...... 
Editor: 

I was very disappointed to note 
the Guardilln's lack of response to 
Spirit Night except for Angela 
Carrier's spirit-less opinion col-
umn ("Spirit Spotty at UCSD," 
Feb. 7). The stalf o( the Guardian 
should have been the first ones in 
line eager to ignite the spark of 
school pride in UCSD's Tritons by 
at least covering the Spirit Night 
activities. Instead, a scathing col-
umn ridiculing the efforts put in 
by all attendees of the game was 
the best that graced the pages of 
our paper. 

Not only was the intensity of 
the game itself greatly dulled in 
the report of the night's athletic 
spectacle, the major element of 
Spirit Night was missing altogeth-
er. 

The fact that the Spirit Night 
competition was not swept DY 
Muir for a fifth year in a row is not 
newsworthy? The fact that the 
NCUp of Cheer" was wQn by 
Warren College for the first time 
ever is not deserving of mention? 
Contrary to belief, a single photo 
on the front page in no way cap-
tured the essence of the spirit dis-

played that night. 
Perhaps Carrier missed the 

1,400 fans that were there, keeping 
the audience charged down to the 
last nail-biting seconds of the 
game. Somehow she must have 
missed the layers of blue and gold 
strewn about the colleges, the 
activities sponsored by student 
organizations campus wide, and 
the intense Triton Pride flowing 
over UCSD for Spirit Week. And 
she obviously missed the point of 
Spirit Night when she suggested 
the flaunting of Triton-esque char-
acters to increase game atten-
dance. Carrier contradicts herself 
when she states, "Most people 
scoff at the attempts made to boost 
that spirit and nothing will be 
accomplished with such atti-
tudes." A scornful attitude is 
exactly the demeanor she takes. 

It saddens me to think that a 
main source of information on 
campus is actuallr working 
against the building 0 school spir-
it by printing such a column and 
ignoring this important event on 
campus. I think the deep soul 
searching for spirit that Carrier 
suggests should start where her 
story was printed, and in tum, 
inspire othe.rs. Perhaps then you'll 
join me, Warren College, and 1,400 
other proud, screaming. and spir-
ited fans that bleed blue and gold 
as we catch the Triton TIde of spir-
it.

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian 

True Spirit of Valentine's Day Survives 
COMMENTARY: Companies' exploitation of the holiday does not negate its value 
By KIM HOOPER 
Staff Writer 

Let me start by saying that I 
am the first person to acknowl-
edge Valentine's Day's potential 
for absurdity. I am fully aware 
that Valentine's Day is a holiday 
constructed to serve the greeting 
card In~ustry, flower companies 
and See s Candles. It is artificial, 
manufactured to boost the econ-
omy ... blah, blah, blah. We've all 
heard the whining from the anti-
establishment - those stubborn 
bitter, opinionated folk wh~ 
refuse to even waltz by the 
Valentine's Day card section in 
the grocery store, wear red- or 
pink (or any variation thereof) or 
eat anything heart-shaped with-
In a month of "V-Day.' 

For those of you who are truly 
committed to raising hell against 
the forces behind Valentine's 
Day, do what you must. Pelt cou-
ples making out in class with 
those little hearts with the nause-
ating phrases on them. Take 
turns throwing darts at the big, 
white teddy bear that says "I 
I?ve you" when you squee~ it. 
I m not one to ruin your fun . But, 
for those of you who just do not 

want to make the effort and 
instead hide behind the 
"Valentine's-Day-is-lame" argu-
ment, stop hiding! 

Just because I understand the 
corporate dynamic that is 
Valentine's Day does not mean 
that I do not think it's enjoyable 

thought to see Valentine's Day as 
a burden, an obligation, an 
unwanted effort. The stereotypes 
are ridiculous. As a woman, I Can 
say that Valentine's Day is a both-
ersome effort for women too. And 
the .men I know, once they discard 
thell macho extertors, admit to 

* all. knuu: that Valentine)s Day has been tainted 
by busi1!css ~nterests. So stop whining about it and 
apprecIate It for what it is at its roots. 
to have one day set aside to let 
that special someone know you 
care. Granted, I am a romantic 
but I still find that most peopl~ 
a.gree with me. College students 
like to sound leftist and contro-
versial, spouting off objections all 

~y. B~t, when nobody is look-
In~ these sa~ people get giddy 
smIles on theIr faces, dreaming of 
red roses, candle-lit dinners and 
w~lks on .the beach, among other 
thmgs (Wink, wink). 

It is ~enerally accepted that 
women Itke Valentine's Day and 
men do not. The idea is that 
~omen scheme for months, writ-
Ing multiple drafts of the 
Valentine's Day card. Men are 

going through at least two drafts 
of the card. 

This year, try to avoid doing 
what is expected of your gender. 
Get away from all that is mun-
dane. lhat is the only way to con-
quer the artificiality and econom-
ics of Valentine's Day. 

~f you're really dedicated to 
5eeJng Hallmark fail, make your 
own card. There are alternatives 
to dinner at the fanciest place in 
La Jolla (bye money), long-
stemmed roses (hello debt) and 
expensive chocolate (time to call 
the parents). Cook dinner for your 
loved one, write a love poem, 
make a tape of romantic songs. 
The most effective way to make a 

~tatement against the economiz-
mg ~~ the day is not to refuse to 
partiCIpate, but to find creative 
~ays to express your feelings out-
SIde the walls of convention. 

We all know that Valentine's 
~y has been tainted by business 
mterests. So stop whining about it 
and appreciate it for what it is at 
its roots - a. day to express love, 
lust, infatuation, appreciation ... in 
whatever way you choose. Don't 
make it a burden. Yes, you can 
maruIest your love for your sig-
nificant other on Feb. 13 or Feb. 
15, but, like it or not, Feb. 14 is the 
date on the calendar and it carries 
with it a type o~ sacred quality. 

Legend has It that St. Valentine 
gave his life to the Romans 
because that was more bearable 
than ~ving up his practice of 
marrymg young lovers. Everyone 
gets busy, especially in college. 
There is school, work and the all-
important extracurricular activi-
ties (most notably, napping). It's 
ruce to have one official day to get 
away from all the hassles of 
everyday life and express yourself 
to the person who helps you get 
through those hassles. Take the 
day for what it is and knock your-
self out on those multiple drafts.

LEiiERS: 
Manager 's policy 
may be personal 
c ........... froIII1 .... I 
point out that Web Editor Brian 
Wikner's editorial about Barnes 
and Noble ("The Editor's 
Soapbox", Feb. 7) may be prema-
ture. Before deciding to boycott 
the company's stores and Web 
site, I would suggest that Wilmer 
do some further investigation into 
what occurred. -

I suspect that the Irvine store 
~g~r i~ simply acting on her 
own trUhabve, usin~ the cover of a 
"corporate policy' to hide h<!f 
own discriminatory preferences 
and to supply herself with the 
"authority" she needs to enforce 
them. It is not unheard of for those 

~n management ' positions to 
mvent rules to satisfy their own 
desires. 

I suggest that Mr. Wtkner con-
tact the Irvine store directly and 
ask to speak to the manager. Ask 
about the "no studying allowed" 
po.ticy, and if they still claim it 
eXIsts, ask about this policy at 
other Barnes and Noble locations. 
Finally, a visit to other Barnes and 
Noble stores to test their enforce-
ment -of the "no studying 
allowed" policy first-hand could 
show that the situation is unique 
to the Irvine store. 

I would also like to suggest that 
he contact Bames and Noble'~r­
porate headquarters and verify 

r tI1a~ -the "no .studying allowed" 
poltcy does In fact exist. This 
would perhaps be most informa-
tive, as the "no studying allowed" 
poltcy supposedly originated 
from Barnes and Noble hea~qUar-
:::t~~~ell'Wb(Jrd probablv very "1bYe~effY& lo!tioWrifhoH:!"onneir

dJscnmi.natory policy. Finally, if 
the policy does exist, it would 
seem reasonable to point out how 
the poltcy could negatively impact 
their bottom line, as pointed out in 
the article.

Erroneous Reporting 
On Athletic T .... 
" I!di~~'"l''' , 

The qu~lity . of editing in the 
sports ~tlon IS beginning to be 
rather disappointing. It seems that 
every article written about profes-
sional sports seems to have at least 
one significant factual error. 

In Bill Burger's column 
"Reality Check" ("The Trade' was 
the cause of success," Feb. 3) the 
focus of the column was the trade 
that supposedly brought Marshall 
Faulk to the Rams for the fourth 
overall pick in the first round. 
However, the fourth pick had 
always belonged to the Colts, and 
the Rams' pick in the first round 
was the sixth overall, which they 
used to draft Torry Holt. The trade 
for Faulk involved the Rams' sec-
ond- and fifth-round picks and 
not their first rounder, as Burger 
c\atmS. This wouldn't seem to be a 
significant error, except for the fact 
that 'The Trade' was the center-
piece of the column. 

This erroneous reporting cou-
pled _with the errors I have 
brought to the attention of the 
sports department before leads me 
:he question Burger's ability to edit 

sports section. The fact that 
there have been some columns 
that were both interesting and 
accurate demonstrates that Burger 
IS qualified at some level. I would 
urge the sports section to double 
check Its facts before writing any 
future articles about profesSional 
sports. 

I beUeve that this would be in 
the best interest of both the 
GIMrIIi/m and the student body at; 
a whole.

Many have called for Barak, 
who has pledged to withdraw 
troops from southern Lebanon 
by July in the context of an 
Israeli-Syrian agreement, to pull 
out now, unilaterally. Such a 
move, they say, would rob Syria 
of that lever.

The achievement will be 

announced on Thursday at 
CERN, the European particle 
physics laboratory where the 
work was carried out. The find-
ing moves experimental physics 
closer than it has ever been to 
the presumed moment at which 
the universe came into being 
and could help cosmologists 
better understand the forces 
behind the primordial explo-
sion itself. 

The Big Bang is the colossal 
explosion in which most cosmol-
ogists believe the universe was 
born, some 15 billion years ago. 
A microsecond is a millionth of a 
second. 

By Wednesday it became 
clear: With the acquiescence or

backed Hezbollah, or Party of

succeeded in setting back the

presence in southern 
Lebanon) but it also

skepticism about the 
peace effort with Syria, 
making it all the 
harder for Barak to 
win public backing if 
the negotiations resume. 

It was widely believed that 
Barak had helped nudge Assad 
back to the table with nis cam-
paign pledge to bring Israeli sol-
diers home from Lebanon by 
summer. Assad, it was thought, 
saw his ability to ease Israel's exit 
from southern Lebanon as a bar-
gaining chip for regaining the 
Golan Heights. 

However, many say they 
believe that "what began as a 
trap for'Assad has become a trap 
for Barak himself," as one 
Westem diplomat said. 

Quarks, and the gluons that 
bind them together, are nor-
mally joined to form protons 
and neutrons and cannot be 
shaken loose individually no 
matter how hard pairs of the 
ordinary particles are smashed 
together. 

To create the new material, 
the scientists have, in effect, 
compressed and heated a ball of 
protons and neutrons so that 
they melted into their con-
stituent quarks and gluons, 
which then floated freely in a 
laboratory for the first time. 

The laboratory's experiment, 
said Michael Turner, a cosmolo-
gist at the University of Chicago, 
"helps take us back to when the 
universe was a soup of the most 
fundamental particles we 
know." 

Because of the tight connec-

Clinton Raises Medicare costs 
benefits as part of the budget 
blueprint for the coming year. WASHINGTON - The 

White House now says President 
Clinton'S proposal to provide 
Medicare coverage of prescrip-
tion drugs will cost 35 percent 
more than it estimated just 
seven months ago. 

cost $168 billion over ro years. 
Even well-run private health 

plans report. that their drug 

In late June, when Clinton 
unveiled his plan to offer drug 
coverage to all Medicare beneficia-
ries, he said it would cost $118 bil-
lion over 10 years. In his new bud-
get request to Congress this week, 
he put the cost at $160 billion. 

Clinton's new budget 
request to Congress this 
week pushes the cost of 
Medicare up 35 
percent from .last year. 

Their approach is different 
from Clinton'S: It would offer 
consumers a wide range of pri-
vate insurance policies to cover 
drug costs. The government 
would offer to pay at least 25 
percent of the premiums for 
insurance covering the drug 
costs of any Medicare beneficia-
ry, with larger subsidies for 
lower-income people. 

. White House officials said 
Wednesday that they had 
revised their estima te to reflect 
several factors, including a real-
ization that the use of prescrip-
tion drugs by the elderly and the 
prices of new drugs were rising 
faster than they had assumed. 

spending has been increasing by 
15 percent to 18 percent a year. 

The change in the White 
House cost estimates underlines 
the difficulty of predicting the 
course of drug spending at a 
time when scientists are continu-
ally developing new drugs to 
prevent and treat disease and 
improve the quality of life. 

Snowe and Wyden described 
their proposal as a middle 
ground between the Clinton plan 
and more conservative schemes. 

Charles N. Kahn Ill, presi-
dent of the Health Insurance 
Association of America, said few 
insurance companies would 
want to offer free-sta~ding poli-
cies to cover drug costs. 

After Clinton offered his pro-
posal last summer, the 
Congressional Budget Office 
said he had grossly underesti-
mated the costs. At a Senate 
hearing in July, Dan L. Crippen, 
director of the budget office, tes-
tified that Clinton's plan would

Vermont May Adopt Equal 
Rights Laws for Gay Couples 

BOSTON - In the firs t 
strong signal of how Vermont 
lawmakers will address the 
issue of, gay marriage, a pivotal 
committee polled its members 
Wednesday and found them 
leaning heavily toward guaran-
teeing equal rights and benefits 
to gay and lesbian couples, but 
not letting them legally marry. 

Eight members of the 
Judiciary Committee of the 
state's House of Representatives 
spoke in favor of a "civil rights 
package" that would create the 
most extensive domestic part-
nership system in the country, 
while three spoke in favor of 

includin~ same-sex couples in 
the state s marriage law. 

Those favoring domestic 
partnership tended to empha-
size that it was a politically fea-
sible compromise, given the 
divided sentiment about gay 

marriage in the state; those 
favoring marriage stressed that 
"separate but equal" was not 
good enough. 

None of the members 
favored trying to defy the Dec. 
20 ruling by the Vermont 
Supreme Court that gay couples 
must be granted the same treat-
ment as heterosexual spouses in 
everything from inheritance 
rights to health insurance bene-
fits. 

In that ruling, the court left it 
up to the Legislature to deter-
mine how it would equalize the 
treatment of gay couples: 
whether through marriage or 
domestic partnership. 

Since then the House and 
Senate Judiciary Committees 
have held two public hearings. 
TIle House committee has also 
heard a range of witnesses, from 
religiOUS leaders to experts on 

the history and law of marriage. 
However, until Wednesday's 
emotional session, its 11 mem-
bers . had stayed largely mum 
about their opinions. 

The House Judiciary 
Committee's vice-chairman, 
Rep. William J. Lippert Jr., said 
the committee session was so 
emotional Wednesday that 
"there were some people in 
tears." 

The committee will try to fin-
ish drafting a domestic partner-
ship bill by the ' first week of 
March, and send it to the House 
floor. Senate leaders have 
promised quick action on the 
bill, so Vermont could pass a 
domestic partnership law by the 
end of its legislative session in 
April.

Valentine's Day Massacre 
The ... 0..0 

BoncIaP Scene. An intimate look into 'Scream 3' reveals the slight nuances oflove and horror 
By JEREMY GRAY 
Senior Staff ~ter 

Stop what you're doing and 
scream. Pretty exciting, huh? Now 
scream again. Mildly exciting. but 
not like the first time. Scream a 
third time. Are people around you 
starting to get annoyed? 

I don't need to tell you that 
"Scream 3" !S the alleged final chap-
ter of the trilogy that started out of 
the gates with fresh legs and is now 
limping toward the finish line beg-
ging to be put to sleep. Oh no, 
instead I want to focus on another 
horrifying event that makes lovers 
cling to each other and causes our 
hearts to pump in frightened antic-
ipation - Valentine's Day. So lock 
your door, snuggle up, and whatev-
er you do, don't answer the phone! 

SEX: 
Scintillating sounds 
seduce the senses 
c .......... rr..,.,..

the tender melodies and stretched 

'ScNInt 3' ..... V·DIIY both 
Involve fIndIn& that special 
-. Sure all you lovers out there are 
so lucky to be with somebody on 
February 14. You get to parade 
them around, dress them up and 
carry around flowers to remind all 
your friends why their lives suck. 
For the rest of us, every smilelrom 
the opposite sex means 'game on' 
as we fight the desperate count-
down to V-Day. I say take notes 
from the modem master, Mr. 
Scream. He found Sidney (Neve 
Campbell), even though she was 
hiding on a ranch as a counselor 
for young WOlJ'erl in crisis. To get 
to her, he kills ., all the cast mem-
bers of "Stab l a fictional movie 
based on - what else - "Scream." 
Talk about thorough! And when

good sex requires. 
Romero, a child prodigy who 
dedicated his life to the art Gi 
Spanish guitar, also raised three 
sons who, to this day, are among 
the most acconlpli!$hed X\litatists

students in the music depart-

agree on the erotic nature of his 
music, but my "special" friend 
and I do! 
v.tous Artists 
The Chillout Mix 
(Editor's Choice) 

Delicious . 
This import 
from the UK is 
one of the best 
side-dishes made for sex since 
designer drugs and whipped 
cream. An eclectic group of 
artists, including Moloko, Blur, 
John Lee Hooker, Morcheeba, 
Future Sound of London and 
Roni Size, help create a deep and 
seductive groove that borders on 
a sleepy hinterland. This is elec-
tronica at its best, infusing capti-
vating melodies with penetrating 
synthesized beats. Simple lyrics 
§o straight to the point like Blur's 
'love's the greatest thing" or 
Faithless' "don't leave" and don't 
go too deep into sentimental crap 
that Dave Matthews has a 
propensity of doing. The tracks 
are also arranged without any 
drastic change in tempo or har-
mony. The songs are blended in 
such an effect as to forget that the 
album is a collection of different 
artists. Even the surprises are 
subtle like the realization that Bob 
Marley is mixed with Funkstar 
De Luxe. The consistency in the 
overall rhythm of TM Chillout Mix 
offers three hours of uninterrupt-
ed future memories. Yet the slight 
differences in each track keep the 
CD from wearing too tired or 
repetitive. The Orb sets the lucid 
ambiance with "Little Fluff): 
Clouds" in track 7 and Blur s 
"Tender" will I,ive you one of 
those mid-sex I'm rooking into 
your eyes and meaning these 
lyrics" moments. This album 
a1lows a couple to share a binky 
and set lOIt in the music or add a 
nice detail to their Red Shoe 
Diaries.

that the opening murders follow 
the order of "Stab 3's" script, but 
since there were multiple copies for 
security reasons (wink) the cast 
doesn't know who's next. The 
video nerd resurfaces on tape and 
explains every single rule of trilo-
gies in excruciating detail (nudge

down in - where else? - a secret

Now I think love is grand and 
aU, but let's face it, V-Day is too 
damn commercial. Do we really 
need a day to be in love? And what 
the hell are we doing the rest of the 
year? On the other hand, "Scream 
3" is a horror movie spoofing other 
horror movies and if the first one 
was subtle, this one is SUBTLE. 
Since it revolves around "Stab 3," 
the wink-wink humor is on over-
drive. The cast quickly figures out 

You can't w. for either one 
of them to end. 

Okay, so "Scream 3" isn't terri-
ble, and I simply refuse to hate a 
movie that kills off both Jenny 
McCarthy and residents of Los 
Angeles in two hours time. Let's 
have a moment of silence for the 
Scream trilogy. Now then, I need

Men's Basketball Falls 
Flat in Second Half 
HALF WAY: After being up 32-31 at half time, team 
goes cold en route to their 12th loss in a row, 69-55' 
By ROBERT FUI10N 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's basketball lost a close 
game to UC Riverside Tuesday 69-55, 
extending their seemingly endless losing 
streak to 12 games. 

The Tritons were actual in the game for 
most of it. 

Things were looking good as UCSD 
had the lead heading into half time with a 
32-31 advantage, but it fell apart after that. 

During the first half they made an 
astounding 57 percent of their shots 
from the field while Riverside only made 
33 percent. 

In the second half, however, the 
Tritons fell to a dismdl 26-percent rate, 
resulting with an overall 4D-percent rate 
for that entire game and the subsequent 
loss. 

Everything but shooting seemed to be 
going well for UCSD. 

"We play well and we play hard," said 
Triton He<!d Coach Greg Lanthier. "We 
just don't have a shot." 

Riverside actually shot worse than 
UCSD for the game, hitting on only 37 
percent for the game. 

In addition, although the Tritons lost, 
.they remarkably out-rebounded 
Riverside, 38-30. The comeback that led 
to the loss emerged from the 20 
Riverside turnovers as opposed to the 
Tritons' 9. 

UCSD's Clark Goolsby made . the 
highest scores at the game with 23 points 
and 10 rebounds to go alOM with two

blocks. 
Also contributing to the Tritons 

effort were Nick Christensen who tossed 
in 10 points, pulled down seven 
rebounds, dished out three assists and 
made one steal, and Sam Higgins with 
15 points and three rebounds. 

The only other Triton who scored was 
Ahmad Russ, who chipped in with 
sevt"n points to go with hjs three 
rebounds and one assist. 

Mark Miller led Riverside with 20 
points and grabbed he pulled down five 
rebounds. 

Teammate Jason Labagh 12 points 
and dished out five assists and grabbed 
three steals. Rion Nolan scored eight and 
had four rebounds and three stears while 
Arron Hands tosSed in five. 

"In the second half the same thing hap-
~ed as in the first half," Lanthier said. 
We didn't shoot well." 

Lanthier sees a number of things that 
his team is doing well despite the accu-
mulating, although they are not coming 
up with wins. 

"We've ~ rebounding well and we 
have good defense," he sajd. 

"It's a riyalry game," Lanthier added 
"We played them well last time we faced 
them. We'll have to do some things differ-
ent ihaft we've done in the last few 
games." 

The Tritons hope to end the season on a 
happier note at the last home game of the 
year and the season as they face UC Santa 
Cruz at 8 p.m. on Feb. 19 following the 
women's 6 p.m. game.

The match will be played at 11:00 a.m.

The team feels confident on the 
upcoming match and believes it has a 
good chance in continuing its winning 
ways and mainting them for the lengtn 
of the year. 

"We expect to win handily against the 
University of Redlands," said Coach La 
Plante. "They are not a super-strong, 
Division 1II team, so we must take this 
opportunity to put another win under 
our belt. When it comes time to play 

teams like Grand Canyon University 
and Western New Mexico University, we 
must have all our spois down. Those 
teams will be our best competition thus 
far, and we must prove that we are 
among the elite Division III programs." 

The women's team was ranked sev-
enth overall in the pre-season Division 
III polls and second in the West Region. 
With this being their last year in Division 
III, their goal is to play for the National 
Champio!'5hip later on this year and go 
out wlth .a bang. 

"Since this is our last year in this divi-
sion, we want to shoot for the champi-
onship," laPlante said. "I believe this 
team can do it. If we can get our number-
three doubles team down, we have a great 
shot to go all the way. We just want to 
make a peat showing this year and go out 
on top.

Baseball Battles for Two. Wins 
MOUND POWER: Fine pitching performances from the Triton arms shut down Occidental, University of Redlands 

y REID MONASTER 
Staff Writer 

UCSD earned two victories 
this past week as they downed 
Occidental College 10-5 and the 
University of Redlands 5-3 to . 
increase it's season record to 3-1. 

Sparked by the pitching of 
Brian Hinson, And rew 
Holloway and Tommy 
Sereno, the UCSD bats 
came alive in Los 
Angeles last Friday at 
Occidental College. 

The Tritons got off to 
an early lead in the first 
inning after four Triton 
batters in a row were walked. 

From there, Triton first base-
man Josh Strobl got things really 
going after he rocketed a two-run 
single to give his team a dominat-
. g 3-0 early advantage. 

When the score was at 3-0, 
junior catcher Jess Warrington 
put the final nail in the coffin with 
a three-run homerun, making the 
score 6-0. 

This big six-run inning and 
good defense, along with no 
errors in their first three games, 
helped keep the Triton stay 
strong. 

The team cam e back home on 
Monday to face the University of 
Redlands. Pitcher John Beaven 
Vi rtually duplicated his previous 
pitching performance by tossing 
seven innings, striking out four, 
giving up one run on five hi ts and 
walking two. 

The only run he allowed was a 
solo home run in the seventh 

inning, and that was with 
the game well out of 

reach. 
Beaven gave credi t 

to his teammates 
behind him in garner-

ing the victory. 
" I managed to get 

ahead of hitters and keep the 
ball down," Beaven said. ' '' My 
defense did a good job of making 
the plays behind me." 

Beaven was supported by good 
defense and a five-run, seven-hit 
offense that included a double by 
left fielder Blair Suzuki and triples 
by third baseman Chad Addison 
and right fielder Brian Terrell. 

Both Addison and Terrell fin-
ished the victory with two hits. 

The relief pitching of Hinson, 
Holloway and Erik Snyder also 
helped Beaven get his first win of 
the year. • 

They scored 10 runs on nine 
hits as they quickly picked up 
their second victory with a score 
of 10-5. 

UCSD had a scare near the end 
of the game. 

At the bottom of the ninth 
inning, Redlands threatened by 
scoring two runs, making the 
score 5-3 with the bases loaded . 

Usa Huff/ Guantlan

ing. Hinson, with his first save of 
the young season, designated hit-
ter Chris Tallman, who hit his 
firs t home run in the eighth 
innin g and freshman pi tcher 
Tommy Sereno, who got his first 
victory, all contributed to the suc-
cess . 

The Tritons had nothing to 
fear. 

Holloway put an end to the 
Redland rally w ith a strikeout, 
earning his first save by catching

103-19 Victory Over La 
Sierra a School Record 

LY COW: After leading La Siena 62-9 at half-
time, the Tritons cruise to a record-setting victory 
By ROBERT RJLTON 
Associate Sports Editor 

Words fail to appropriately convey 
the all-out dominance of the UCSD 
women's basketball team against La 
Sierra University at home on Tuesday 
night. 

"Blow-out," "Iaugher" 
"demolish" come to mind 
to describe what 
~oosely could be 

called a contest, but 
these words all fall 
short of describing what really 
happened. 

How about 103-19? 
That's right, the Triton women's bas-

ketball team downed the Golden Eagles 
of La Sierra 103-19 in front of a pleased 
but shocked home crowd. 

The winning margin of 84 points is 
the largest in Triton history. 

Eighty-four points eclipses the previ-
us mark set in 1987 as the Tritons blew 

out Mills College 100-19. 
The 103 points is also the first time 

UCSD has gone over the three-digit 
mark this season. 

"We knew they weren't that strong," 
" Triton Head Coach Judy Malone said. 

"We thought they would score in the 
fifties." 

There are ways to examine this game 

(». 

other than by the score to get an idea of 
what happened on the court. 

UCSD was up 61-9 - at half-time. 
"We said, 'let's work on some 

things,'" Malone said. 
Malone spoke of how to keep her 

team involved after such a huge mid-
point advantage. "We worked on our 

boxing out and our rotating. It 
will help on down the road." 

The game was 
over before it 
began, as the 
Tritons were up by 

20 at 22-2 with only eight min-
utes having ticked off the clock. 

The Tritons, who have had turnover 
problems in games earlier this year, 
clean up their act in the laugher. 

The Tritons only had 10 turnovers 
and took 41 steals as the 'visitors gave 
away 51 turnovers. 

UCSD out-rebounded the opposition 
43-26 and took 77 shots while La Sierra 
only managed to attempt 33 ill-fated 
buckets. 

Coach Malone did her best to keep 
the gcnne respectable by not running 
up tile score. 

Malone went deep down the bench 
early on in the first haU, giving every-
one some some playing time.

Women's Tennis Team off to 
Quick Start With Two Wins 
LOVE DEUCE: UCSD team bursts out of the starting 
gate as they downed Point Lorna Nazarene, Sonoma State 
By ARVIND VASAN 
Staff WrIter 

After two 'early losses by the number 
one and two players fot the UCSD 
women's tennis team, the Tritons rallied 
Tuesday to a 7-2 victory over Point 
Lama Nazarene University and 
earned an unbeaten record of two 
wins and no losses. 

The matches consisted 
of two sweeps of each 6-0 
in the sinJtles portion, by 
Yen Yen Ho and Rachel 
Gunther, and a 8-0 sweep in the 
doubles portion by Kirsten Olsen 
and Rachel Gunther. 

The cl~ first matches by numbe1'-one 
player Amy Tranckino and number two 
Melissa Liao resulted in set scores of 7-6, 6-2 
and 2-6, 7-5, 7-5, respectively. Ho put an end 
to the early PNLU run by sweeping Darcy 
Duffin, and Lindsey Tadlock ousted Gina 
Nardiello 6-4, (H) to gain back momentum 
for the UCSD team, which they never relin-
quished. 

"The first two matches were so close; 
Amy and Melissa played outstanding ten-
nis, but the ball didn't bounce our way on a 
few critical points," said Triton head coach 
Liz LaPlante. "Overall, those matches could 
have gone either way." 

The matches, played at Point Lorna 
Nazarene University, saw th~ UCSD 

women's tennis team battle back from 0-2 
down to sweep the rest of the matches in 
definitive fashion. 

"80th teams were cheering and clap-
ping for their fellow teammates," said 
laPlante. "We seemed to feed off the ener-
gy and take control of the match near the 

end." 
She went on to complement the 

doubles' teams for their out-
standing play, and said that 
they "lOoked as solid as 
ever." 

This victory for the 
women's team on Thesday pro-

ceeded a 8-1 victory over Sonoma 
State University on Friday January 28th at 

UCSD. 
UCSD ,awept the singles portion of the 

matches, with dominating scores of 6-0 and 
6-1 a.ll across the board. 

"We stayed aggressive and consistent 
throughout each match," laPlante said. 
"They seemed to hit the ball hard, but we 
were the ones that got the ball back each 
time." 

Sonoma State did manage to put a score 
on the board in the last match with a 8-2 win 
by the doubles team of Katie Slizewski and 
Kari H . 

The ~D women's tennis team will try 
to improve its record of 2-0 against the
