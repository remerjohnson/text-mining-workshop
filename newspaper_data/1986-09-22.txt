Street by police station 
closed pennanently 

The area behind the UCSD 
police station , Just south of the 
MagnetiC Center, will be 
permanently closed, in 
accordance with the Long-Range 
Development Plan approved by 
the UC Regents in 1982, and will 
be used primarily as a service 
road, with a minor pedestrian 
mall built nearby, according to a 
planning depanment spokesman. 

The main reasons for the 
closure involve the long-ra nge 
plan to cut off traffic mrough the 
center of campus, moving all 
parking to the periphenes, and 
to avoid any unnecessary 
problems occurring because of 
the extensive construction in the 
area, the planning official said .

Guardlall 's first Issue of the year 

College IS a new experien 1' , a 
ttme in your life to experiment 
with new ideas and touc h upo n 
parts of yourself that you never 
knew existed , Remember, the 
student is a unique animal , an 
individual away from the 
confines of home but still 
snuggled in thc safcty net of a 
university community, Never 
agalll will you have access to 
14,000 people with such a 
variety of backgrounds and

years slip by in lecture halls and

life goes on, even if you flunk 
your biology final , and the four 
or five years you spend here will 
give you much more than just a 
degree , 

At the Guardian , we hope to 
kindle student activism and 
initiative , As a student 
newspaper, our purpose is not 
merely to record events , but to 
shape future ones by offenng the 
widest range of opinions and

students, contains the work of 
students, and is published for 
students, We encourage you to 
take advantage of what the 
Guardian has to offer in terms of 
a public forum, We also offer the 
only practical newspaper training 
available on campus, Our current 
editorial staff is of professional 
caliber; several members have 
experience working for such 
recognized newspapers as The 
Los Angeles Times . The San Diego

Trapped in evil 
By RICHARD ADAMS 

As the Princess of Wales has 
evidencly deCIded and 
exempltfies Llil her own account , 
the bell has tolled for the luxury 
fur industry, as contemptible 
business constituting a major 
moral stigma upon the face of 
Western civiliz.ltion While the 
trade endures, this society is not 
really entitled to any sen e of 
colleCl1ve ~lf-respecL All that ha'

More than a centul), later, 

however, the number of fur-
bearing animals trapped in these 
torture machines for import to 
this country and elsewhere has 
greatly increased , A conscrvative 
esmnate of the total annual figure 
for Canada and the United 
States is 20 milion - far more 
than the number of Jews 
murdered by the Nazis , If such a 
comparison eems tJ$teless or 
inappropnate, remember that the 
question under consideration is 

A proportion of trapped 
animals bite off their own legs in 
order to eseape - sever fie ;h, 
sillew and bone, The pain 
involved docs not differ from 
that which would be felt by a 
human being. Suc h animals arc 
known to tmppers as "wringers," 
to forestall wri nglllg-off, some 
traps arc not pegged down, but 
attached to a grapnel on a wire, 
As long as the animal can limp 
about , dragging the grapnel, it 
will not hite off its paw, It cannot 
go far and the trapper will find 

To meditate upon what an animal endures while gripped 
alive in aleghold trap is to be filled ith horror, and with 
shame for the human species as a whole. 

is involved and , second , thc 
rapacity and specious dishonest)' 
of those controlling the so-called 
industry, The furriers them elves, 
however, are no more to be 
blamed than pros titutes (which 
is what they arc: to prostitute 
being "to surrender to an 
infamous usc ," OED), There 
remains a demand, so these men 
upply it , being, of course, the 

sort of people who could not 
make so much money in any 
decent way, It is we, the public, 
who arc the real culprits, V.' hen 
we stOP buying, even Harrods 
will have to think again, and the 
alllmals will stop bein tortured to 
death , 

In defe nse of the so-called 
Icghold trap, described more 
than 30 years ago by a Home 
Office comminec on cruelty to 
animals as "a diabolical 
instrument , capable of inflicting 
indescribable sufferi ng," there is 
nothing any longer to advance, 
Invented during the first half of 
the 19th century, its effect has 
been unsurpassed carnage and 
agony among fur-bearing 

not "Can these animals reason or 
aniculate?" The questions is, 
"Can they suffer?" There can 
never have been any greater 
suffering, 

To meditate upon what an 
animal endures while gripped 
alive in a leghold trap is to be 
filled with horror, and with 
shame for the human species as 
a whole , The pain alone, of 
course, is terrible , The animal is 
held for 24 hours, 48 hours, or 
even longer by spring-locked 
metal jaws crushing a broken leg 
(or even the pelvis), In addition, 
there is the torment of hunger 
and the worse torment of thirst 
The blood auracts flies and not 
infrequent ly predators, The 
shock, constraint and panic 
terror, acting upon the instillcts 
of a wild animal are mOSt 
distressing to contemplate, Many 
people have said to me, "Don't 
tell me: I don't want to know," 
Yet we are all collectively 
responsible , By law. fur can be 
retailed in Harrods, Edelsons 
and elsewhere, up and down this 
country, 

it. 
In Canada and in most states 

of the United States, anyone can 
become a trapper. Children, 
adoleseents and adults alike can 
enroll for training courses, I have 
heard a nine-year-old child boast 
of taking ten blows to kill a 
trapped raccoon. Traps can be 
bought over the counter. No 
official returns are required of 
the number of animals trapped. 
However, to give some idea of 
the scale of the b~iness. during 
a typical recent year, 1983, the 
skins of more than 22,998,000 
fur-bearing animals were 
imported to the United Kingdom 
alone (Department of Trade 
figures). Assuming, as the British 
Fur Trade Association climbs, 
that 15 percent of these died in 
traps. this means that in 1983 at 
least 3,449,700 animals were 
tortured to death for import to 
the United Kingdom alone, The 
annual world total is obviously 
far higher. The industry does not 
challenge this figure , It boasts 
that sales are increasing,

Editor: 

The UC Out of South Afnca 
Coalition would like to 
congratulate those regents who 
voted for the divestiture plan 
adopted on Fridy, July 18, 1986, 

Nevertheless, It is sad that it 
tOok 10 years and the loss of 
over 2500 lives and three states 
of em~rgency in the la'S! year to 
convince the governor that 
divestiture was the only morally 
and politically correct choice. 

President David Gardner's 
continued opposition to 
divestiture is unacceptable and 
unbefitttng of the leader of the 
University of California, 
President Gardner intends for 
.he Ulllversity AdviSOry 
Committce on Investor 

Responsibility to continue its 
prevIous c harge of evaluating 
corporations within the UC 
portfolio based on their 
adherence to the Sullivan 
Pnnclple s through the 1986-87 
se h 01 yea r. The current plan for 
divestiture offers a one year 
grace period dunng which 
compames would be urged by 
the University to break tics with 
Soulh Africa; after that. 
divestiture Will take place over a 
three year penod , What the 
UACIR should be doing, If there 
IS to be a UACIR, is to stan 
pre suring those corporations to 
leave outh Alnca, 

The tntranslgence of the UC 
Board o f Regents on the Issue of 

apartheid for the last 10 years 
calls into questions the wisdom 
of having an undemocratically 
appoi nted board of primarily 
wealthy white businessmen 
making deCIsions with far-
reaching ramifications for the 
Universiry and ItS students, 
faculty and staff. 

Students, faculty and 
unionized staff demand and 
de serve more power in the 
deCISIOn-making process of the 
UllIversity of Cahfornia , The 
next goal for student actiVi stS IS 
to work for a more accountable 
and representatlve Board of 
Regent s ThiS obVIOusly means 
that much of the upper mata 01 
the University bureacracy must 

be forced to release its strangle-
hold on deciSion-making power. 

But divestment is nOt the only 
issue and never has been, There 
are also the issues of affirmative 
action and retention programs 
for students and faculty on UC 
campuses; the attack on financial 
aid, and the extensiveness of the 
UC role in the u.s. mihtary-
industrial complex, The 
UniverSity must continue to be 
held accountable for every 
deCIsion that it makes, 

Students have established a 
moral precedent and must

About 80 to W5 percent 01 the 
fur coming ontO the m.lrket III 
this country 15 "!armed " VII tu,lll), 
all is mink or fox , plus so me 
chinchilla , Fur farming IS vtlely 
Inhumane in three respec ts, 
First, the animals arc coni1ned III 
conditions which , as the RSPCA 
has stated, would never be 
approved under the Zoo 
Licensing Act, 1981. Second , the 
mink and fox, which by their 
atavistic nature arc active, 
predarory and territorially 
defensive (a wild mink needs 
about 25 acres of territory) are 
denicd all outlet for their natural 
functions , After weeks of 
confinement they become, in 
effect animal lunatics, no longer 
representative of the species and 
spending much of their time in 
compulsive, repetitive 
movements reminiscent of 
autistic infants, Third , they arc 
killed within about one-seventh 
of their natural lifespan, In short, 
they arc "things," existing merely 
for their captors convenience 
and profit. 

The fur industry cxists not for 
any human need , such as hunger 
or pharmacology, but solely for 
luxury, vanity and adornmcnt. 
There is not even any valid 
argument for protection against 
cold , I n 19tH I made a voyage 
through the Antarctic in 
tcmperaturcs often reaching less 
than minus 40°F, No one -
passe ngers or crew - ,wore fur 
gall1lenrs, 

There has recently been much 
Canadian propaganda about fur 

CllllStitut I ng thc liveli hood 01 
lOd lgeno u<; pctl plc In facI, the 
gre.lt majority of tran satlantic 
trappero; arc pan-time amateurs , 
but ('ven conceding some truth 

, to thc claim, why sho uld we be 
obllgcd o n that account to buy 
fur? If somco nc says his 
livelihood IS ~eIling onions, you 
have no moral obligation to buy 
them, The slave trade, in its day, 
was the basis of Liverpool's 
prospenry and the livelihood of 
thousands, What moral 
justification can there be for a 
man who lives by the infliction 
of agony or ml ery on hiS fellow 
creatures? 

Anyone who cares to a k for it 
can obtain from the Brtish Fur 
Trade Association , at 68 Upper 
Thames Street, London EC4. a 
pamphlet entitled "The Case for 
Wearing Fur." It is the most 
threadbare little piece of rubbish 
imagillable - badly written , 
logically unsound and full of 
unconvincing nonsense, Any 
intelligent sixth-grade child 
would have made a better case , I 
merely mention it by way of 
emphaSizing that the trade ha 
shown itself unable to advance 
any vahd or convinclllg 
justification of this mean 
institution , 

The past two centuries have 
seen the destruction of many 
evils: black slavery, chid labor in 
factories, public execution, 
flogging, rcstriction of the vote to 
males, the use of the leghold trap

UCSB chancellor resigns 
AFTER MONTHS of turmoil concernlllg hiS adm lll istra tive abilities 
and the mi suse of University 
fund s on his home. Chancellor 
Robert A. Huttenback of the 
UniverSity of California, Santa 
Barbara resigned after a 
suggestion to do so from UC 
President David P. Gardner. 

Since that time, Gardner has 
temporarily replaced Huttenback 
with fonner UC Irvine 
Chancellor Daniel Alrdich . 

Aldrich began his interim 
chancellorship on September l. 

Huttenback had been a 
controversial figure during his 
eight years at UCSB, but not 
until the beginning of spring 
quarter did the problems begin 
to peak. 

In May. the Faculty Senate 
voted 31-3 to ask the President 
to conduct a comprehensive 
inquiry into Huttenback's 

performance as chancellor. 
Thc results of the rnqUiry we re 

cxpected to be dclivered at the 
UC Board of Regents meeting in 
latc July, sa id UC officials. but 
because of Huttenback's 
reSignati on. wi ll be withheld . 

Huuenback's resignation is 
effec tive December 31. but hc 
will take a pa id -leave of absence 
from September 1 until July 31 , 
1987. He is eligible to return to 
the UniverSity as a tenured 
faculty member in the History 
Department, but said he has 
made no decision yet about his 
future . 

Concerning the $) 74,000 he 
spent on his household 
expenses, the majority used to 
renovate his kitchen, dining and 
living rooms, Huttenback claimed 
to have used the house 
extensively for University 
purposes, specifically for 

lundral sillg. 
Hu[(cnba k said 111 late June 

thar he would repay the money 
he spent on his housc. 

ince that time, he has repaid 
$ 15.129 to an independcnt 
money-ma naging orga nizati on . 
the UCSB Found ation, 

During his cight years at 
UCSB, Huttenback has created a 
great increase of donations to 
the University. has lured 
nationally respected faculty 
members, and has established 
many profitable and prestigious 
programs. But along with his 
many accomplishments. 
Chancellor Hu[(cnback has seen 
many problems, 

UCSB students have exprcssed 
dissatisfaction with the 
Chancellor's preoccupation with 
raising money and his neglect of 
undergraduatc programs and

the meter u ually responds hy

"Bogus coinage was a problem 
tn certam areas on campus 
before the swttch to quarter 
meters," said Hudnall. With the 
new meters. the bogus COi nage 
has been reduced conSIderably. 
However, accordtng to a poltce 
sour e, "Some Mextcan coins 
work" in place of quarters. 

In the ncar future , even

THE NINETIES: DECADE OF DECADENCE 
Lee A TIh 4:00 - 5:20 BB 2135 cc: 2568 
Instructor: Bram Dijkstra 
The l890's were a decade in which novelists, poets and painters, all over Europe, were 
fascinated by the symbolic potential of images of evil. It was a decade of economic crises 
and widespread industrial and imperialist expansion, The average person seemed 
subjected to the whims of mysterious, asocial forces beyond the control of simple 
humanity, In English popular and "high" literature alike, these tensions came to be 
expressed in a proliferation of threatening goddesses, vampires, hypnotists, Martians, 
and other imaginative representations of the late Victorians' fears and suspicions about 
the capacity of civiliza tion to control what they considered to be the evil core of our 
animal nature, Scapegoats had to be found, and hence it was a period of the most 
unabashed racism and sexism, This course will explore the social significance of these 
developments through a reading of some of the most famous -works of British literature 
and popula r fiction of the period, We shall also try to.account for the renewed curren t 
popularity of many of these works : " 
Texts: The Picture oj Doriqn Gray (l891), Trilby (1893),juaetheObscure( 18 95), Salome, 
War of the ,Worlds (l8~,8), Dracu/a.(l897), Hearr of !Darkness o.8?9), , _

Record number of students 
expected as fall quarter begins 

More undergraduates th'ln ever 
will pack classes and on-campus 
living spaces when the 
University of California, San 
Diego welcomes students for the 

"beginning of the fall quarter 
today. 

An estimated 13,000 
undergraduates will begin 
arriving on campus to prepare 
for the first day of classes on 
Thursday, September 25 

The new and returning crop of 

students represent a 7 per ent 
mcrease over last fall's enrollment 
of 12,110. Of the total, 9,250 arc 
continuing .students, while 3,750 
will be new students, according 
to registrar Ron Bowker 

"T he number of new students 
IS a bit higher than we hoped it 
would be," said Bowker. "We 
were shooting for around 3.500 
new students." 

Bowker said the new 
University o f Cahfornla 

appll a(Jon polley. which allows 
students to apply IIldividually to 
the U campuses of their 
choi e , is respon ible for the 
higher-than-expected figure . 

"We had more than 19,000 
applicallons, and we normally 
ge t around 7,000," said Bowker. 
"Since this was the first year of 
the new application process, it 
was difficult to estimate how 
many of the applicants would 
actually come to UCSD:' ~ 

The record number of students is going to mean record-length lines.

Guidelines proposed 
to handle cheaters 

By MATI LAlT, ASSOCiate News Edlfor 

T HE CAMPUS Student Conduct Comml[(ee has proposed changes in the 
current academ ic dishonesty 
policy, wh ic h will be 
implemented In the upcoming 
Conduct Code Manual if 
approved by the AcademiC 

na te and the UC student 
conduCt coordinaror, accordmg 
to Nick Aguilar. 

The purpose of the 
com mirtee's recommended 
changes is to "clear up the 
points of procedural ambiguity in 
the current policy," Aguilar said . 

"The policy under 
consideration establishes a 
standing committee (10 hear 
dishonesty cases) as opposed to 

. the 'ad hoc' comminees that arc 
n'''1 used ," Aguilar said. 

The advantage of ins!I(utlng a 
"stand ing committee," according 
to AgUilar, is that "it will do awa}' 
with potential or apparent biases. 
It will also mean that the 
committee will be more fami liar 
with the heaTIng process. 
therefore creating a bettcr 
likelihood of a student receiVing 
a fair hearing." 

Under the current di shonesty 
polley, a firs! vlola!lon 
const irutes academic probation 
and a second olTense rc~ults in 
expulsion. The proposed 
changes, according to Aguilar, 

MKNOW 
COPYING 

FRONTWARDS 

will 'provide tor extenuating 
ci rcumstances and will serve to 
judge each case on its own 
merits. 

"Then> are renain cases wherc 
a first oO'ense IS serious enough 
for cxpuls lon and sometimes 
when a second offense only 
WamlO(S academic or 
administrative penalities," Aguilar 
said . 

Peter Kim, former 
commiSSioner of academic affairs 
and a member of the Commi ttee 
on Educational Policy, helped to 
initiate the c hanges and feels 
that the new policy "IS vel)' good 
compared to (he las( one which 
is a pi ece of mumbo-j umbo. Thi s 
one is more clear and gives the 
ins tructor guidance a to his rolc 
in the incident." 

"LaSt year there were probably 
less than 10 formal heanngs on 
academic dishonesty," Agui lar 
said. "It IS my belief that this 
policy will e nsu re the student's 
ri ght to due process is prmccted 
while giving the administra tion a 
clearer proced ure to follow." 

T hc changes were th .' result of 
a periodic review of till: Swdcnt 
Conduct Code. The committee 
hopes the reVisions will be 
approved by the cnd of this 
quaner so they will be effective 
in the winter and printed in the 
up oming Conduct Code 
Manual.

Sounds from the sidewalk 
By LISA SKOW 

I T USED TO RAI too much in our neighborhood . Although the trees, the grass, 
and even the ugly bushes that 
lined our front walkway all 
turned a health ), green, I didn't 
like the rain. Dunng the summer 
months it would wash away our 
hopscotch board and we would 
ha\'e to wait until the cement 
dned to draw a new one. But the 
new ones never looked qUite the 
same. It was always omething: 
crooked Imes, oval boxes and 
illegible numbers (especially 
eights, they were tricky). But the 
rain was not the only ravager of 
our hopscotch board. People 
walking by would carelessly cross 
directly through it, refusing to go 
around or step o ff the curb to 
avoid smudging the lines. 
Bicycles and Big Wi- als were 
even worse. And w '/ 
brother and I were nghting, he 
would deliberately go to the 
sidewalk and stomp and scuffie 
h is feet until on a vague outline 
of connecting boxes could be 
seen . 

"No, mommy. no!" 
"Ilow m.my? I low old are 

your' 
"Two, mommy, two! " 
"How old arc you Steven 

Foreman?" 
"T hree!" 
"I can't hear yo u! " 
After finally getti ng him to say 

"three" a:-. loud as he could , she 
proceeded to hit hiS rear three 
times with her large wooden 
spoon. But each time she hit 
him , she would pause. 

"Now how many. How many 
more Steven Foreman?" 

"Two! Two! " 
"How many? I can't hear you!" 
To spank hi m th ree times took 

almost te n mi nutes. Shelley sat 
humming, preoccupied with 
trying to fi x her battered doll 
house. I sat li ste ning to her i brother's cries; they pierced 

;;t every room in the house. The 
-<:! windows were open in the living 

~ room and I wondered if anyone 
;;>.., on the sidewalk could hear. 
~ I used to hear many things 
o from the sidewalk: the hungry 
if clamor of dinner dishes and 

Not everybody had a 
hopscotch on their front 
sidewa lk. Lori Westbo's mom 
would n 't let her draw one on 
theirs; she thought it looked 
tacky. We always had one, 
weather, Big Wheels, and my 
brother permitt ig. Shelley 
Foreman, called "Shushy" by her 

"g;;...::..l.J."':";';., silverware , family gossip, 

parents, would come over and 
use mine. She did not know how 
to make them and had trouble 
just playing the game. Her 
glasses were Incredibly thick, at 
least a half-inch . Without them 
she was legally blind and with 
them she was terribly farsighted . 
She would look at objects close 
up, touching them with her nose . 
Sometimes I would move her 
hopscotC h marker back one or 
two squa res, or call a "liner" 
when she came very close. I 
liked pla)'lng hopscotch with 
her. I always won . 

Because we we re neighbors , 
Shelley and I played together 
often. She had better toys than I 
did, so when we were not out on 
the sidewalk we usually layed in 
her playroom. It was nOt only 
because she had an enormous 
amount of tOys , it was rather the 
kind of toys she had : newer, 
bigger, more expensive . One year 
for Hanukkah , Shelley received a 
wooden playhouse . the kind you 
could walk into without ducking 
or pretending to duck your head. 
It had shuttered wmdows and an 
open-and-close door. It was the 
best ChrIstmas present I ever 
received . 

Some days we spent all of our 
time in it, furnishing it With 
coffee can couches and 
chalkboard tables. We pretended 
we were a family , Shelley being 
the wife and I the husband . 

Shelley's and Steven's 
relationship was much like my 
brot her's and mine. We we.re 
indispensable to each other as 
playmates, yet intolerable as 
siblings. After Shelley refused to 
allow Steven to be the "daddy" 
one cloudy afte rnoon, li ttle SteVIe 
Foreman took a red crayon to 
our cherished home. Accordi ng 
Shelley said I had to be the man 
becuse I had shorr hair. It made 
sense In our yo uth . Sometimes 
her younger brother Steven 
would Joi n our domestic fa ntasy 
world as the baby. He never 
stayed long though, for when 
Shelley In isted that he be 
spanked for not drinking all 01 
his milk (which had become 
quite warm after three hours), 
Steven refused to play anymore . 
And we were left a ch ildless 
couple once again. 

to Shelley, Steven gOl in "big 
trouble ." 

One time , Steven broke the 
chimney o ff of Shelle y's new doll 
house. By the way Shelley 
screamed you would have 
thought he. had take n off her 
a rm . Steve n Foreman was in big 
trouble. 

"Steee-veni Get to your room!" 
Mrs. Foreman hove red over 

her son like the giant in the 
story about Jack and the golden 
goose. Her arm was outstretched 
with rhe index finger pOinting to 
the other side of the house . 
Steven look pe trified and ran 
cryi ng to his room holding the 
back of pants with both hands. 
Mrs Foreman dried her hands 
on a dirty dishcloth and chose 
the larger of the two wooden 
spoons from the dish drainer. 

"How many do you get?" 

Is there a party in the house? 
By ROBERT LEONE, Staff Wn/rr 

O NCE AGAIN, a new group of students will be introduced to the 
traditions of the UCSD party 
scene . Panies at UCSD have 
often d isplayed the highest 
standards of creativity and 
organization . However, the first 
few parties of the year are like 
pre-season football games; often 
substandard , .even at times 
haphazard , And if the initial 
parry of the year does indeed 
have a theme , it is often the 
unpred ictable Toga Pany. 

To keep this from happening, 
I've listed below some of the 
b tter party themes I've corne 
across in my four years of liver 
scarring at this fine insmution . 
Perhaps the mOSt original was 
the Lamaze Method Party, where 
everyone dressed In their best 
obsteoical finery , celebrated 
natural birthing, and drank a 
red-colored punch This party 

was the brainchild 01 the 
demented Bruce Bums , who 
dropped out of UCSD so he 
could go to med sc hool. 

Another fine and different 
party Idea is the Dress as a 
Member of the Opposite Sex 
Parry, ThiS works best in coed 
dorms or OIher suc h mixed -sex 
liVing Slluallons. Oddly, males 
seem to resist the idea more 
than females do. However, It 
does make a memorable party

slamming doors , children crying. 
Sitting on the edge, near the 
gutter, I overheard the muffied 
conversations of passersby, and 
watched the ants dodge their 
feet by traveling Single-file 
through a crack in the cement. I 
didn't know where the ants went 
when it ra ined , but they always 
came back. When my fa ther 
would forget 10 tum off the front 
spri nkler , some of the wa ter 
would invade the sidewalk 
crack~, leaving the ants floating 
toward the sewer. The next day, 
they would be there again , 
different victims of future 
sidewalk massacres 

So when we did not feel like 
plaYing hopscotch, we could 
always listen 10 the sounds of the 
neighborhood or wa tch the ants 
file by. During the summer, my 
twO older sisters played baseball

An untouched land 
By JON PRElMESBERGER 

A TONE POINT, the road along the border turns south lind runs between 
barre n , treeless hills li ned fo r 
miles with dilapidated, shack-
like houses. In ga udy greens, 
pi nks and di rty blues , most of 
the houses look half-asse mbled 
and completely condemnable. 
Banered cars and discarded junk 
fi lled the a rea, wi th old ti res 
reinforcing the hi llsides. 
ReSidents arc known to go down 
to the riverbed alongSide the 
road to dig sand and pick up 
rocks when they need concrete 
to bUild their walls and homes. It 
is a valle)' of houses buIlt up out 
of the leftovers of somewhere 
else. It is the "colomas" of 
TIJuana, one-half hour away from 
UCSD. 

These hills were offiCially 
given away by rh e MeXican 
government over six years ago to 
anyone who wanted to build and 
live on them rent-free. The air is 
usua lly smoky from the local 
factory and the co nstant burning 
of refuse . There IS no running 
water; that need is trucked in 
daily. There IS an occasional pay 
telephone, although It wIll more 
rhan likely be out of oreler. Only 
a partial area is supplied with 
elecmciry 

and cactus garden , past more 
shack houses and way back up 
where the road became badly 
rutted to Lupita's house ncar the 
top of the hIl l. Lupita and her 
fi ve children li ve in a one-room 
house on a very s reep slope: the 
addi tion wc we re bu ilding, only 
6112 feet high , 10 feet Wide and 
20 feet long, would increase her 
home to the tota l size of a 
common bedroom, We walked 
down the hill to her house where 
she and her twO youngesl 
children , Alberto , la, and 
Magdalena , 7, were outSide [0

introductions were .,hort, only 
tWO of us knew halting Spanish . 
None of us knew very much 
about the family, and the 
Spanish remained a hdrner.

arc junk and trash everywhere . 
On her small plot arc lin cans, 
rusted -through pots, food 
wrappers, pieces of cardboard, 
unrecognizable plastic toys and 
mi scellaneous oclds and ends 
Most of thiS general confusion is 

pu~hcd outward to rhe sides 
where pieces of wood , wire and 
metal have combined IntO a

some of the beans had spilled 
over and where nics swa rmed , 
we aVOided . 

To begin construction , we 
first had to remove a great deal 
of things whllh Luplta had 
already moved mro the frame of 
the addltlon. One person IIfred 
up a box contal nll1g an old 
orange, a cruSt and some stale 
tortillas and asked , "Is thiS 
garbage or arc they savi ng thiS?" 
No one wanted to ask so It was

about and was helpful handing 
out nails . Luplta walked around 
straightening things according to 
her sense of ord er. "Have you 
ever been inside?" someone 
asked. Another nodded and said , 
"It is so jammed With stuff there 
are only a couple of feet to turn 
around In" "How do they leep?" 
The question went unanswered

perennIal lands of more

We drove down thi s road on a 
recent Saturday. We were a 
handful of studel1ls from UCSD 
and two men drivers from the 
local Catholic Community. In 
conjunclIon with rwo American 
nuns , ister Maggie and Sister 
Rose , who assist the elderly and 
the infirm with La Casa de Los 
Pobres, the Cathoh Student 
Center at UCSD organ izes trips 
fo r any who want to volunteer to 
help the imppverished people of 
the area. Last year, the students 
built a retai ning waD to prevent 
storm runoff from flooding a 
home. Mostly, the students help 
by do ing minor chores fo r the 
fra il , such as cleaning or just by 
organizi ng sports, like soccer, for 
the kids. This pa rt icular Saturday 
we were continuing our special 
project for th is year - building

house.

half cove red by a pile of debris 
that separared Luplta from her 
neighbor. They worked fast to

to move away from that side. 
Lupita asked about the 
insulation , and we explained 
how it will keep th e room cool 

Afte r a mile, we turned ofT the 
highway and drove up a bumpy

Negotiating the hill , we carried 
down all our tool and materials 
to th e back of the house , where 
there was a caged ra bbit, a

In rippling waves In a faraway

perfectly, and there was a ragged 
edge here or there , we were 
proud when It came together 
and felt It was the best room In 
the neighborhood . 

When work slowed down and 
materials ran out, two of us took 
some tools back to the ars and 
then climbed the last fifty feet to 
the top of the hill. The Wind hit 
our faces as we stepped clear 10 
where the hilltOp meched fiat for 
acres . The perfect panorama of 
San Diego to the north surprised 
us. We made out the blue hill of 
Mt. Soledad o n the far ho rizon. 
The entire land to the north was 
a cool blue . Pt Loma stretched a

Sidewalk 
Continued rrom page 20 
in the street with the 
neighborhood boys. I was old 
enough to play, but not old 
enough to play with them. 
Although Lori Westbo was older 
than I . they did nOt let her play 
either. She always had to be in 
by 7:00, even on summer ntghts 
when darkness waited until a 
quarter of nine. Lori could not 
play baseball anyway: her tall, 
clumsy body would nOt allow for 
it. Like Shelley, she had thl k, 
inefficient glasses that framed 
her eyes like poorly hung blue-
trimmed picture frames. So Lori 
watc hed squlnnng from the 
sidewalk; and I watched the ants 

and the people parade through 
our hopscotch board. 

One summer evening after 
returning home from a trip 10 
California, I went down to Lori 's 
house to see if he wanted to 
come out. It was only 5:00 and 
our hopscotch board was stili 
fresh fro~ last week. The Ii nes 
were barely smudged and the 
numbers were clear and in order 
(eve n the eight looked good). I 
balanced myself on the sidewalk 
edge as I cro cd over it . my 
bare tocs Just brushing the lOp 
white line of the last box. I ran 
the rest of the way. 

When I came to Lon's 
sidewalk, I stopped abruptly. An 
angry VOIce was shouting form 
the Westbo's kitchen. 

"Why did you do it? Tell me. 
why did you do it?" 

"I didn't. I dIdn't do It! " 
"Don't lie to me!" 

"But I didn't, I didn 't do it !" 
"Don't lie to me! " 
Every lime he said "he ." I 

heard a loud slap followed by a 
louder cry. I was the only one on 
the SIdewalk, the only one who 
could hear. Like thunder after 
Iightni ng. each time I heard "lie". 
Lori followed with a cry more 
pl!lable and frighte ning than the 
one before it. I thought thaI if I 
rang their doorbell he would 
have to answer It . and the 
thunder and hghtning would 
stop. But I r.ln home instead , 
leaving the slOrm behind me . 

I did nOI stop and balance 
myself on the edge of the 
SIdewalk. I went directly through 
th e mIddle of the hopscotch 
board , mearing each number as 
my dirty sales ignored the clearly 
chalked lines. It didn't marrer, I 
thought. It would probably rain 
that night anyway. ~ 

The]oy of Wood 
By SUZANNE LIFSON. Features Ediror 

A COLLEGE MENTALITY goes, if you don't want to do the dirty dishes. Just stick them in the oven. right? That way they' re out of the way, off your mind and the kitchen looks 
great. Mom should be proud of the way you've perfected your house 
maimenan e methods, but she's not. 

While at home this summer. every morni!1g my ellicient mother 
would come in to give me a hake . Human alarm clocks are simply 
more pleasant 10 wake up to , not to mention that it would take an 
industrial-size alann clock that buzzed at legally deafening volumes 
to even get a twitch from my ears. Getting me out of bed is altoge ther 
another problem. 

As soon as my mother enters my bedroom, her mind goes to 
work. She doesn't noti e the bowls full of potpourri atop my pine 
dresser, nor the pictures of former handsome dance teachers. nor 
the sc hedule of summer '86 Chicago events pinned on my cork 
board. Instead, her eyes go right to the three pieces of white fuzz 
that she believes are disturbing my mauve carpeting. She proceeds 
to scan across the wrinkled curtain edge, the rug that needs to be 
straIghtened and the carpet that "mllst be vacuumed immediately." 

Okay, I respect her dedication . especially in today's society 
which la ks speclf1c gender roles , but it's 7:30 am! One morning, 
before I had even opened my mouth to yawn, I heard my mOther 
draggtng the vacuum c\edner down the hall , bangIng il along the 
freshly patnted walls (her next projec(7). t'\s I opened my eyes. my 
eyelashes gOt caught In a thIck. black ruhber cord that was pulh ng 
a ro,~ m}' cheek. Yes , the outlet she deCided to use Ju~t happened 
to he I1C,11' the head of my bed. 

I lay In bed , hopIng it was "II a dream with Intense acou.,tlcs. but 
reahzed It was real when the hed stancd moving b.lCk .md fonh 
The vacuum banged into the bed fmme as m}' mom attempted to get 
undemeath it. I assume she was fIghting to get the crumb orrwo left 
over from the last time my fnends and I ate a snack under the bed . 

After the motion sickne s settled , I deCIded it was time to take the 
me<1n m,lchine out of my mom's swee t gnp. As I rea hed alit to grab 
It. I 5.1\\ that she had already moved into the next bedroom. I guess 
she saw a stray thread in there too. 

Long. Ia~ summer "daze" (()me to an end as fall quarter beginS. There 's no need to stop gOIl1& to Ihe beach. ~ 
bur it's time co trade In sunscreen for a sweater and beach rowels flor beach blanhcts "" 

I yelled "good mornIng" to my obsessed mom. who was busy 
franllc.llly retaliati ng against those carpets. he didn't say anything. 
All I heard was the vacuum cleane r shifting into power dnve. I 
always knew it was more than rhe beauty that attracted me to 
wooden floors

Parties 
Contll1ucd !'rom p.lgC 20 
SIX years In the ann}'. we once 
planned b th a Jungle Pan),. with 
IV)' festooned wall~ , and a 
Combat Rock Pany. whllh g,\\'c 
us an excuse to ge t the olive 
drabs out of the mothhall~ again . 
Some people even tried tll show 
more kin than Rambo. These 
party ideas may not he as 
popular now as th cy ()nce were , 
however. 

Another idea, perhap more 
festive , is the Game Show Party. 
For this. set up different drinks 
behind doors I , 1. and 3. Have 
people get in th e door onl)' if 
they know the questi ons fO the 
answer. or take away someone's 
drinking r ceptacle if they roll a 
"drinkless" on the wheel. Face it . 
you always did want to dress like 
Vanna White and Pat Scjak. 

A cience FictIon Pany might 
be in order for this year, the 
twentieth anniversary of tar 
Trek's first season . or course. it 
doesn't have to have a tar Trek 
theme; a general science fiction 
pany is just a good a 
celebra tion. 

For thn,>e \\hn'd r,Ithel' look 
ahe.ld tll the future thall b,lck at 
It , th e TCl1lh Anniversary 
ReUnIon Party . although a little 
carl}'. could be Just the ticket for 
fun . Who and what wIll Yl'U be 
ten years from now7 Take 
pictures so that when the real 
one rolls along , you 'll be ,lble to 
document YOll r memOrIes 

For those with a taste for 
nos talgIa , a historica l p,my can 
be loads of fun . Re reale the 
Middle Ages. the CIvil War, or 
the Kennedy admini stra tion with 
a Way Back When Party. 

The VCR has become a fact 01' 
life in these electronic times, and 
it would only be fair to have a 
party with one. Show the films of 
Merle Oberon , the worst actress 
with the best face in the history 
of cinema. or see Harrison Ford. 
again and again and again , in a 
theme-specific Movie Maratl:'t on 
p.any . & sure to have the 
popcorn popping in a separate 
room so rhat the vIewers will not 
be distu rbed by the noi se.

This is the Big Leagues. Get used to it. 
By PHIL LAUDER 

D EAR FRESI IMI: N: Wclcome Oc,lr relUrnmg stude nt5: Weknme back. 
Dear returning elghth -ycar 
se nt ors: Hey, get out of hcre , 
already. 

I would likc to take thl~ 
upporlUnity to bnci Incntmng 
freshmen on what to expcct 
dUring th e (olmng I1lne months, 
JUSt so It doesn 'l come a~ a total 
shock. For you returnce~, 
conSider this a reln',her coursc 
on whal you knew you dlJn 't 
miss all that much , 

GOll1g from high sehool to 
college is like going frolT' Mars to 
PIUIO .. , or maybe Flut, Mars. 
The point is, this is a ncw world , 
To quote trite phnlsc number 34, 
"It is what you make of it." 

Regimentation IS a thll1g of the 
past, No longer will you be ~e nt 
to Saturday Detention because 
you're on the wrong part 01 
campus, Did you have those 
security guards at your high 
sc hool? You know, step OUt of 
class to go to thc balhroom and 
they bark , "HEY - YOU GOT A 
HALL PASS, PUNK?" "No I don't , 
sir. And JUSI because the poltce 
force wouldn 't accepl you IS no 
reason 10 be bitter." 

All that's a pan of the past. 
lOW you can go wherever you 

damn well please, whenever you 
please , This is college, The Big 
Lragucs. Sounds good so far, 
doesn't it? 

And then, of course, there are classes. No more "Mr. 
Peterson" - or "Ms. McGillicuddy"-kind-of-teachers. These 
are professors. Projs to you. They won't know you from Joe 
when they walk past you on the Main Drag. They won't 
even grade your tests - some mysterious reader does that. 
These are Big League Professors. Get used to them. 

Freedom is the big difference 
betwcen th ere and here, You 
don 't havl' to do anything now 
You don't even have 10 go 10 
class, really, Stay In bed if you 
fccllikc it. Go to the beach , it's 
dose enough, Party 'til three 
evcry night. Nobody really cares, 
if you don 't. 

'Course, there are a few 
co nsiderations involved in th ese 
deCisions . Here's the firsl one: 
academic probation, II you ' 
intend [0 pany 'til three every 
night , you will get to know those 
[WO words real well. Also thcS(.' 
words: parcnts cutting off lunds, 
get a Job , the 4:30-10-11 shift .11 
Jack in the Box , homclessncss, 
suicide prevention hotline, Get 
the idea? But don 't gct me 
wrong: You 're free to do whal 
you Wilnt. This is co llege. 

Ad.lusttng from life with mom 
and dad anti brother Billy to It fc 
with college . roommates is 
another tough one, Only because 
most of us didn't deal with the 

little problems of college IiiI' back 
at home. Like people coming 
over and throwing up in your 
bathtub. You thll1k I'm Jokll1g, If 
you ever throw a pany in your 
lour to seven years at this 
campus, someone will throw up 
in your bathlub - unless they 
don 't make it that far. I gU<lrantee 
It. 

Also, most of us didn 't deal 
wl[h dorm food back home, Put 
this one in the same category 
wl[h people throwing up in your 
bathtub. I don 't want III gCI gross 
here - llr is I[ too late? Well , 
Jonn 1{1{K.1 is a subjeCt worthy of 
a column on I!~ own , Suffice il to 
say Ihat I[ 'S an adjustment. 

Rest assured , one of your 
dorm - or house -mates will be a 
freak , A Cl'rti lied freak. He or she 
\VlII pta)' the harmonica whtle 
lud)'ing, will pick her nose at 

awkward times, will leave his 
diny undcrwear laying on your 
bcd, will go on the Cambridgc 
diet every Other week, will clutch 

a loaded nile wirh her when she 
sleeps, will d ream out loud 111 
Gennan". , WIll do sOllletllillg that 
really plSse~ you 011 . That's jusr 
Ibe way I[ IS, Get used lO it. This 
is college, 

And then , of course , there are 
classes, No more "Mr. Peterson"-
or "Ms, McGillicuddy"-ktnd-of 
teachers, These are professors. 
Profs to you. They won't caU you 
by name, They won'l know you 
from Joc when [hey walk past 
you on the Main Dmg, They 
won't even grade your tests -
some mystc rious reade r docs 
that. These are Big League 
Professors. Get used LO [hem, 

Classes arc a bit more difficult 
hen.:. Take language courses, 
Remember hIgh Sl:hool Spal1lsh? 
The big !ask for lhe week WdS 
memoriztng (on as tempor..lry a 
basis as p('bsihle) 20 words for 
the weekly vocabulary test , and 
then memonzing a two-minute 
skit lhat begins, -Buenos dias, 
Pepc, cdmo esci [U familia?" 

Forget that cra p, Try leamtng ,0 
words each day and delivering a 
len -ml nutc dISCOUrse that 
tncorpor..ltes all 20 words tn an 
II1telligcnt, coherem manner. 
Since the language sequence 
II1volves concurrent course~ In 
both gmmmar and conversation , 
you will be forced to lalk dUring 
your tenure here - and we aU 
know that talking in a foreign 
language, In Jrom oj olher people, 
IS the most horrid thing ever. 
Sec, the point in college IS to 
leOL h you pan Ish - and that's a 
fairly new concept to most of us 
fresh out of high school. Get 
used to It. 

Also get used to tests thar have 
norhing to do With fairness, No 
longer will you be gening 90s on 
every tcs!. Try 60s. Of course , 
many times 60 will be an A 
That's because the median on 
some tests is 36. Get used to It.

Volume 13, Number 1 September 22, 1986 

U.E.O. PTesents the Tich pageant of R.E. 

Life's Rich Pageant is being 
heralded as REM's most 
accessible album to date and 
one that seems certain to let 
the much deserved light of 
above-ground popularity in 
on this previously mysterious 
and mostly subterranean 
band. This is just a great 
record . The University Events 
Office started the year off 
right by booking the group on 
its c ross-coun try tour , 
because by this time next year, 
it'll be in too much demand 
(and probably have too much 
self-respect) to play in the 
echo chamber of the UCSD 
.IO'm. And live performances 
have counted for much of the 
band's popularity up until 
now. 

Life's Rich Pageant paints an 
ominous picture of an 
American landscape, one of 
possibility for reshaping the 
future pitted against 

by sean waptaff 
impending self-destruction. It 
is not an angry picture, but a 
frightened, timidly hopeful 
collage of the world facing a 
vast expanse of second 
chances with its heels slipping 
dangerously back toward the 
abyss. 

Though previous albums 
have counted for a smattering 
of air play and a growing 
follOWing for the IRS label 
quartet from Atlanta, this one 
is already making synthesizer-
heavy pop station lists, not 
because the band has gone 
comm er cial, b ut rather 
because it keeps doing things 
its own way - one that's 
inspirationally, musically and 
lyrically compelling. If there's 
a new American band with a 
meaningful "mes&age" set to 
top-rate rock , this is the one, 
REM i a band that the criti s 
and the country folk alike are 
lining up to call "Our Own." 

REM's music is firmly 
rooted in the la~d around 
them, The gut tune on the new 
release, "Cuyah~," swirls 
around the poisoning of the 
Ohio River, whi h gained 
ominous notortety for 
catching fire a few years ago, 
but like most of REM's new 
songs, the candle manages to 

,.stay lit in the blackness of a 
lOOming storm. "Let's put our 
heads together and start a new 
country up ," ba ndleade r 
David Stipe'S voice drones. In 
"The Flowers of Guatemala," 
Stipe sings : "There's 
something that I've never seen 
before / the flowers often 
bloom at night/ Amanita is 
the name / they cover 
everything. " 

Though the reco~d doe n't 
explicitly denounce; anything, 
one torrid tune , 'iHeyena," 
does offer a sharp tap on the 
head with a message

R.E.M.arking on the University's rich pageant 
continued from page ~9 
immediately clear to even the 
thickest skulls. "It quotes 
FDR: "The only thing to fear 
is fearlessness/ The bigger the 
weapon, the geater the fear." 

good deal of fun. The 
intentionally misspelled 
album tide itself is taken from 
a remark by Peter Sellers as 
Inspector Clouseau. "Under-
neath the Bunker" and 
"Superman" (a remake of a 
'60s psychedelic tune by the 

Cliques) pay for their frivolity 
with musical charm. Besides, 
this is the band whose remake 
of "King of the Road" shows 
up periodically on redneck 
juke boxes. 

ke consrruction, gained 
notoriety for the edgy sound 
that is too often smoothed 
over by the big label record 
companies. This is due in part 
to IRS, which has made a 
happy habit of not trying to 
fix a good thing. But the 

band's lyrics were often 
rejected as "obscure," and the 
driving beat of rock'n'roll was 
missing, none of which 
mattered much to the steadily 
growing contingent of fans 
who reveled in the chime of 
Peter Buck's guitars , the 
harmony of Mike Mills ' bass 
and the subtle rumble of Bill 
Berry's drums, and especially 
to the shivering depth of 
Michael Stipe'S vocals . The 
band's ringing guitar, garage 
ba nd twa ng and Sti pe 's 
chilling voice are still 
everywhere in Life's Rich 
Pageant, but the messages are 
clearer now, and so are the 
drums. 

In the shadow of punks and 
bands like the Talking Heads, 
REM views the world with a 
certain pathos and bitterness, 
but is refreshingly unresigned 
to fate and not cynical about 
unapproachable problems. 
Rather, the quartet takes a 
fundamental approach in the 
title and lyrics of "Begin the 
Begin, II where "Silence means 
security / Silence means 
approval." This and other 
cuts such as "These Days," 
where Stipe declares the 
impressive bottom line of the 
record: "We are young 
despite the years/ We are 
concern/ We are hope despite 
the times," feature stinging 
guitars and a screaming 
tempo. 

REM's previous albums, 
most recently Fables of the 

"I Believe" inexplicably 
begins with a rush of Blue 
Ridge mountain banjo, only 
to jump headlong into a 
quick-fire lesson in self-
control: "Explain the 
difference between/ what you 
want and what you need/ 
there's the key... Think of 
others/ The others think of 
you." 

• 
It took Born to Run to make 

Springsteen a household 
name because it was his first 
music to reach for an audience 
that couldn't find a 
comfortable home in the 
street. Although it's missing 
the pop thump of the Boss's 
Great American LP, Life's 
Rich Pageant could be the 
record that finally leads REM 
out of the dark Georgia 
underground, into the riches 
of the American mainstream. 

Despite its world view and 
is conscience, REM offers a R.E.M., fram left to right: Bill Berry, Michael Stipe, Peter Buck, Mike Mills

Diego's Solana Beach is 
no . place to park your car 

A trip down' the Pacific 
Coast Highway through 
Solana Beach will inevitably 
take you past the sedutive 
spectre of Diego's North. It's 
tough to resist the pastel pink 
stucco arches, and blazing 
blue and pink neon although 
the neighboring businesses 
have resisted its presence with 
passion. To a college student 

$20, three hours and two 
funked-out ringing eardrums 
later, you casually stagger out 
of the black-mirrored, bikini-
clad wai tressed, video 
screened hellish popping 
inferno into thecomparitively 
organic doldrums of the 
street. 

Two long blocks later, you 
find your car, or rather, you 

don't find your car. It has 
been towed; the fee to pick it 
up, including " service charge" 
and "mileage" -$85. 

Warning: every business 
within miles of Diego's has a 
contract with a t o wing 
company to keep their lots 
"clear" after a certain time of 
night. 

- sean wagstaff 
in search of a party, Diego's is r-------------------------.J 
like cotton candy to a sweet-
toothed child. But even to the 
casual passer-by, Diego's 
invites casual inspection. 

So, heading North, you flip 
on your signal, hang an illegal 
U-turn and, knowing full-well 
parking will be tough up the 
street', you stop in the first 
dark, deserted lot you find. 

A quick two block walk 
ends you up standing in the 
shadow of Art Deco himself, 
where he casually liberates 
you of five bucks. A casual 
drink ($3), another, well , 
maybe one more ... 
The crowd is a wild blend of 
the exotically uptight. 
Yuppies and surf rats make up 
the bulk of the crowd and the 
'Scene is pretty much the 
" meet" market standard of 
the genre. Three bars and 
standing room almost 
exclusively floor, lend that 
special air of a passionate 
battle between the sweat 
glands and the underarm 
super sticks. You sweat. 

ralllrnin' 
lVith the 
ralllones 
'bv john nee 

For the past ten years, the 
Ramones have been recording 
and touring relentlessly 
without achieving the 
commercial success that they 
deserve. Long before the 

hard~ore movement, they 
created the basic foundations 
that the British punk 
movement would later be 
built upon . Prior to 1977, the 
band played in England to an 
audience that would later sell 
their own version of the 
Ramones in the form of the 
Sex Pistols and the Damned. 
However, like most great 
Ameri c an musi c, the 
Ramones, on this side of the 
Atlantic. have been unable to 
garner little more than a cult 
fo llowing.

rammin' 
COIIIinMcd from Pace 33 

1be Ramones have never 
conformed to the traditional 
dictates of the music industry, 
and it seems that this idealism 
has caused them to be treated 
as a novelty rather than as a 
serious band. They are a 
caricarure of themselves with 
the long hair, blue jeans and 
leather jackets that they have 
worn since forming in the 
early seventies. Despite their 
unconventional approach, 
they have found loyal support 
from college radio and even 
the "rock of the eighties" and 
the "on the cutting edge of 
rock" stations across the 
country. 

1beir appearance in the 
low-budget Roger Corman 
film Rock and Roll High SchooL 
was a good chance for the 
Ramones to make it into the 
big time. They beat out Oteap 
Trick as the featured act in the 
film, mainly because 
Corman's company could not 
afford a "better" act. The film 
was shot on a budget of less 
than $300,000 and did not do 
very well at the bolt office on 
lits first releue. However, 
Kock and RoU High SdllJoL has 
grossed several million dollars 
as a cult favoritr in midnight 
movies, an houses and video 
C8S11etre sales. The Ramones 
will never be at a loss for an 
audience, but they will never 
have a Top Ten single either. 

1bey have made conces-
sions in the past few years to 
soften their image by changing 
producers (Phil Spector, the 
inventor of the "wall of 
sound," produced End of ~ 
Century a few years back) and 
feeble atrempts at videos on 
MTV, but America is still not 
ready for a band like the 
Ramones. Currently, the 
Ramones are lampooning the 
recent flood of benefits like 
Uve Aid and Hands Across I 
America with their own ' 
version of altruism: Ramone 
Aid and Handa Across Your' 
Face. 

The Ramones will performl 
at the Bacchanal on Tuesday.: 
The show starts at 8 pm. Fori 
information call 560-8022.

STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR STANDARDIZED TESTS 

1UOR11H1'IIST OBTAIN RELEASED COPIES 
OF TIlE. TEST If these are available, they provide 
the most eftective basis for achieving familiarity 
with the directions and question-types. Remem-
ber, practice makes better! 

BE CLEAR ON SCORING PROCEDURES. If 
your test includes a guessing penalty. random or 
wild guesses can decrease your score. Penalty 
scoring requires intelli~nt guessing through 
choice elimination. 

EXAMINE YOUR ADMISSION TICKET As 
soon as you receive it, make certain your identi-
fying infonnation is correct. The day of the test is 
no time to find out there's been a mistake! 

VISIT TIlE TEST SITE AHEAD OF TIME. 
Olecking out directions and knowing parking. 
bathroom. and water fountain locations can make 
a big difference to your comfort on exam day. 

HAVE A LEAN BREAKFAST AND A G<X)D 
NIGHT'S SLEEP. Don't deplete your energy by 
useless Iate-night aamming or a fat-filled. greasy 
meal that will mean an upset stomach. jitters, or 
extra bathroom trips! 

DURING 1HI'IIST ARRNE HALF AN HOUR 
EARlY. Why invite disaster by failing to allow for 
traffic snarls? Besides. youll need time to relax 
and "wind.down." 

BRING PENCllS SHARPENER, ERASERS. 10 
ASPIRIN. KlEENEX, AND NO STUIJV MATE-
RIALS. '.bull need at least four somewhat blunt 
#2 pencils <sharp points tend to break off on the 
test grid). If you're the nervous type, you might 

want to include some light reading to focus and 
relax yourself until the test begins. 

USE A WA1LH 10 mcE'r'OURSEl.F. If you 
don't have a stopwatch, you may want to set 
your watch back to 9:00 at the beginning of each 
new section. ('Though some monitors will let you 
know how much time remains,don't count on this.) 

KEEP A STEAIJ{ mCE. \bu know youll get 
the same credit for answering easy questions as 
you will for solving "toughies:' Be sure to capital-
ize on the ones you understand by refusing to 
spend too much time on a few stumpers. 

''MONITOR'' VOUR ANSWER GRID Make sure 
extra graphite marks don't get registered as 
answers. Also. prevent tragedy by checking 
question numbers against grid numbers every 
ten answers. 

AFTER THl1IST TALK m us. If yoo feel your 
perfonnance was dismal enoogh to merit cancel-
lation, check with your Kaplan instructor. 1.This 
applies particularly if you were ill during the test.) 
Objective discussion of your concerns may help 
you realize you didn't do as badly as you think. 

YOU CAN CANCEL SCORES. If you do want to 
cancel your score, youll need to notify the test 
administIators in writi!)g within three ~. 
(Remember that even if you don't cancel and a 
school receives multiple scores hom you, they 
will count the highest.) 

GOOD WCK! From all of us at the Stanley H. 
Kaplan Center. before. during, and after your test, 
our sincere wishes for success.

ADULT DEVELOPMENT AND AGING: An examination of the 
development stages of early, middle, and late adulthood and their processes of 
behavior change . Topics include impact of societal and cultural factors, continuity 
and change in the individual personality, influence of norms and roles, family tife, 
adult sexuality, and ethnicity as a cultural experience in human development. MWF

INTRODUCTION TO URBAN DESIGN: This course will stress the 
elements of urban design and it will examine the factors necessary for the execution 
of an urban design plan. In conjunction with this, crucial potential flaws to the 
execution of any urban design plan will be presented. Students will be required to 
take a look at the city of San Diego as a piece of urban design in a structured exercise 
designed to teach how to examine a city qualitatively from an urban design/urban 
planning point of view. The spec. geographical and poltical forces that help to shape 
San Diego will be examined throusr the revi~ of current planning projects a~d t.he 
forces at work shaping San Diego s future deSign. An exploration of the posslbhtles 
of what may be done to enhance urban design in San Diego will also be examined.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS OF URBAN STUDIES: Man'sactivities 
have had dramatic impact upon the natural resources of California's urban areas. 
The class will focus upon the nature and extent of such impact with an emphasis on 
evaluating the current status of resource·related planning on management efforts. 
Major themes will include politics of resource protection; provision of parks and 
open space; preserving natural area; wildlife management; air and water quality 
issues; land use planning by state agencies; protecting agricultural lands and guiding 
the location of new development. The go'" of the course is to provide the student 
with a better understanding of the ways in which the natural resources of urban areas 
are being protected and planned for by government agencies and the limitations of 
current programs. Prerequisile: upper·division standing. M 3:005:50 (Crandall)

Say 
goodbye 
UCLA 
By GUS SANTOYO. Sports Editor 

L ET ME BE honest: I personally think UC 0 should make a 
conscientious effort to go 
DiVision 1. The subject has been 
flogged mercilessly for years now 
by some coaches, 
administrators and students, but 
no one seems to want to listen I 
s uppose it's a drcam to see Dean 

mlth and Nonh Carolina play 
in the gym. But then again my 
other dreams include wanting to 
play quarterback fo r U C That 
infatuation , along with scveml 
o thers , are long gone . 

UCSD is not, thank goodness, 
USC No one can complain 
about the academics here; the 
educanon you get is top-notch . 
But a vital pan of the college 
experience is the sense of pride 
and community one feels for the 
school, and the traditional way 
of achieving this through 
backing intercollegiate athletics. 

Unfortunately, this school has 
a history of student apathy 
toward the intercollegiate athletic 
program, and the argument for 
the lack of support is always the 
same: -You spend so much time 
studying at this school that when 
you do get some free time, you 
don't want to waste it going to a 
game nobody cares about 
anyway." My, how those feelings 
would change if the BrUinS were 
playing in Triton Pavilion. 

Intramural's dynamic duo 

But the Bruins are never gomg 
to come to Triton Pavilion , and 
for some people in the upper 
echelons of the school 
administration , it's just as well. 
They want to keep a Division III 
standing intact so your average 
Joe or Josephine has a shot at 
being involved in intercollegiate 
athletics (and winning). 

Hello, this is 1986, and this 
school is growing faster than the 
Fridge's belly, This is San Diego, 
a burgeoning metropolis , a 
gorgeous city by any standards, 

Please tum to page .. 2 

By GUS SANTOYO, Sports Editor 

T HEY LOOK like the oddest match SInce Felix Unger and Oscar Madison. 
One comes from the George 
Hamilton School of skin care ; he 
has an impeccable tan that never 
fades. SoCal th rough and 
through. The other one is a bi t 
of a Norman Rockwell . Tall . 
Married . Two kids and one on 
the way. 

But for UCSD, it's been a 
match made in intramual 
heaven . For a decade , Mike 
Hipp and Scott Bemdes have 
been in charge of this incredible 
sports machine caned UCSD 
Intramurals, a program that 
boasts approximately 16,000 
participants, which on a 
percentage basis makes it one of 
the largest intramural programs 

in the country. 
IMs are not JUSt a passing 

fancy at UCSD, and it's easy to 
understand why Hipp and 
Berndes are such BMOCs (Big 
Men On Campus , in case you 
don 't know). They implement the 
program , which includes 
scheduling of games and 
facilities , traini ng and evaluating 
of refe rees, and other special 
eve nts. 

Doesn 't a job of this 
magnitude take its toll in lMs 
dynamic duo? Hipp and Berndes 
take it all in stride. -We love our 
job," said Bemdes. "Where else 
can you dress up in shorts, not 
be tied to a desk, and meet the 
kind of people we do? It's all just 
a lot of fun ." 

Those who have participated 

Women's soccer scores 15 
goals to crush Redlands 

let'S JUSt say they aren't 
dancing in me streets of 
Redlands over this one . The 
UCSD women's soccer team 
seemingly embarrassed Redlands 
early on in the season, by the 
grotesque score of 15-0. Triton 
halfback Laurie O'Connell , though, 
th inks Redlands has very little to be 
ashamed of. 

"Even when the score gO! 
bad ," said O'Connell , "they kept 
on tryi ng. They wouldn 't give up 
even though they were out of it." 

As for UCSD, no one can 
accuse them of bemg out of it. 
The Tritons came ofT an early 
road trip thrashing not only 
Redland s, bur also shutting out 
Claremont 7-0 and nipping the 
1985 NAIA Champs, Westmont, 
2-1. But the coup de grace and on 
t~';s road trip for head coach 
J ohn Leaney wasn't any of th e Adricne Clam 

three wins. 
"Out of all the games we 

played away, I was most pleased 
with our game against Santa 
Barbara" the one we lost ," said 
Leaney, referring to the scare 
UCSD gave to UC Santa Bamara, 
one of the country's best teams 
in Division l. UCSD was actually 
winning the game against the 
Gauchos 1-0 , but some 
brakdown in the game plan COSt 
them the game, as they lost 3-1. 

O'Connell dIdn't see UCSB as 
such a formidable foe . "I think 
we played reaDy well: said 
O'Connell , "bur I'm still kind of 
bummed that we lost. We could 
have beat them , and I thmk we 
could take them if we ever 
played them again ." 

The one loss that the Tritons 
came away with is more than 

Please tum to page i3 

in lMs have wimessed the kind 
of personal supervision Hipp 
and Bemdes give to IMs . Both 
snoop around games like cheap 
detectives, whic h is their way of 
overseeing the operation to make 
sure things run at peak 
efficiency. 

"We'd like to keep a good eye 
on the program ," said Hipp, 
"and that involves going to the 
games and seei ng that everything 
goes smoothly." 

Things have not been goi ng as 
smoothly as they would like for 
the upcoming intramural season . 
Major renovations of Muir Field 
have put it out of use until 
probably Spring Quarter. Similar 
work on Pryatel Field will make 
it available for limited use only. A 
new faCility , the Supercomputer 
Field (also known as Mile High 
Field) located north of Third 
College, is to be used this year, 
but it will not completely relieve 
the loss of Muir and the partial 
loss of Pryatel. 

"We're just scrambling for 
every available space ," said 
Berndes, "but 1 don 't think we'll 
be affected too much ." 

One major change that will 
affect all who participate in LMs 
is the team registration 
procedure . The lottery system 
has been eliminated because , 
according 10 Hipp , "people were 
getting cUllhroat and greedy, and 
the uninformed were getting 
sh ortC hanged ." 

The new system is as lollows' 
e Team captains (with their 

completed roster forms) will 
fonn a line to the register at the 

north~SI comer door leading 
in to me ReeGym hallway and 
conference room ~ll before me 
time of me scheduled captains' 
meeting. 

e At the prescribed time, the 
door will open and team 
captains will file into me 
conference room for a brief 

infonnation and rules meeting, 
and teams will register on a first-
in/ first-served basis. 

This new system , acco rding to 
Hipp and Bemdes, will get rid of 
several problems. "Teams were 
coming in with five or six guys. 
All the guys would draw 
numbers , and then they'd use 
the best number as their lottery 
draw. A lot of people were 
getting left out," sa id Bemdes. 

Will the new system work? 
"We don't know if it's the best 
system, but we know it's a better 
system: added Hipp. 

Hipp and Berndes have seen 
thousands of intramural games 
and for them it's still amazing 10 
see the quality of play achieved 
in intramurals. "Most of the 
people out there go aD out and 
the games can be JUSt as 
dramatic as the ones on TV," 
said Hipp. "Every year there are 
four or fj ve really fantastic 
finishes. [t gets to be really 
eXCiting." 

For srudents, the excitement 
can reach a fever pItch at an 
intramuml match . Last year , a 
Triple-A soccer game between 
Super Mex and Pars fi lled up the 
Warren Field . "It wa s morE' 
people than I had eve r seel' at 
the intercollegiate teams' games," 
said Berndes. "It was really loud , 
and one team had its own 
cheerleaders. " 

How much bigger an 
Intramurals get? "We're bursting 
at the seam right now," saId 
Berndes , "and if we don 't do 
something about developing new 
facilities soon, it's going to limit 
drastica lly the number of people 
who can participate in 
Intramumls." 

"It's all In the hand s of the 
students ," added Hipp. "The 
students pay for the facilities we 
u and only th rough them an 
we expand ." ~ 

Men's soccer reloads 
for 1986 campaign 

H [S TEAM was winning 4-0, by soccer definil10ns a blowout , but UCSD 
head coach Derek Armstrong was 
not a happy man. 

"Cmon, let's play occer!" 
barked Armstron)(, hIS British 
accent as thick as a warm 
guinness. UCSD added another 
goal in defeating Loyola 
Marymount, but for Armstrong, 
there's sti ll plenty of work to be 
done. 

"It's :Ill a matter of getting 
things right," said Armstrong, in 
hi s fourth year as head coach , 
"because the team we were 
playing wasn 't very good . We' re 
finding it difficult to get up to 
last year after losi ng four starting 
se nior players." 

Duplicating last year's success 
will be a difficult task by any 
standards. The 1985 Tritons 
went 21-2 , including a win in 
the Midwest-Far West Regionals 
of the NCAA Division 1II playoffs 
aga inst arch rival and soccer 
powerhouse Claremont. UCSD 
also came within a whIsker of 
advanCing to the semi-finals 
before losing to Washington 
Universiry of SI. Louis in a 
double-ovenime penalty 
shootoul. 

Nevertheless, the loss of four 
seniors has not completely 
decimated the lcam. Armstrong 
has 13 players returning, 
including Robert Paterson, last . 
year's freshman sensation , who 

led the team in scoring with j 7 
goals. 

With this solId nucleus still in 
tact, the pre-season National 
Rankings of Di vis ion III sc hools 
had UCSD as the fifth tcam in 
the nation . 

Bur then disaster struck. 
Paterson and junior forward John 
"Bubba" Wingate were declared 
academically inehgible before the 
team's o pener against UC Irvine. 
"They were taking summer 
classes and the paperwork hadn 't 
come th rough , so they couldn 't 
pla}1 in the first game ," explained 
Armstrong. 

UCSD lost to UCI 2-0, with 
the absence of Paterson and 
Wingate proving to be very 
costly. But it wasn't the team's 
only problem. -We missed 
Robbie Paterson and Wingate ," 
said Armstrong, -but it was also 
our first game together, so we 
had a little bit of first game 
problems, along with missing 
three other players. But we did 
miss Robbie Paterson more than 
anyone ." 

Both Paterson and Wmgate 
were reinsta ted for the next 
game against Biola. Paterson 
must have been out to prove 
something because in UCSD's 3-
I trouncing of Biola and the 5-0 
thrashing of Loyola Marymount, 
he scored five of the team's eight 
goals. 

But even with the spectacular 
return of Paterson , Armstrong still 

ha s some problems to Iron OUl. 
"Our weakness right now is that 
we have a 101 of young people on 
the squad and at thIS moment 
we've got some injuries, which is 
kind of alarming. Paul Carlson, 
who is a bit of a rock for us in 
the defense , is out for a few 
weeks with a foot injury. These 
kinds of losses really hurt us." 

Armstrong likes being an 
independent Division III school 
because of the freedom in 

selecung opponents , but for now, 
scheduling may be the team's 
own worst enemy. 

At the moment, we're starting 
off with a schedule that's a bit 
toO hard with all the injuries," 
said Armstrong. "Having both 
LaVerne and Chapman is tough 
early on in the season , but to be 
honest, everybody is going to 
give us tough games until we get 
organized . At this point, we're 
still setthng."

and all UCSD has to offer IS an 
intercollegiate program that is a 
mere showcase where the friends 
and families of athletes can ooh 
and ahh . Sorry, but you can keep 
it. 

We are introducing in this 
issue, the Guardian Intramural 
Report, which will appear every 
Thursday. Do not be mIsled . This 
won't be a bunc h of scores of the 
week's games. It will be about the 
people involved in the UC D 
Intramural program. Also, there 
will be the 1M Notebook - a 
compilation of the 1M SPOrtS 
briefs, and the Guardian Game of 
the week - featuring complete 
coverage of an important 1M 
game each week. 

OK, sports Jans, you asked jvr If and ir 's finally aniwd - The Guardian, in conjunction with BJ. 's Chicago 
Pizza , presents the inaugural Sports Trivia QUIZ Now's yvur chance to benefit from all those useless sports Jacts 
that have clutrered your brain Jrom years oj scouring the sports pages. Every week, the Sports Trivia Quiz will

entries will be entered into a drawing, and one winner will be drawn Jor ,each quiz Each winner will receiye a 
BJ. 's Chicago pizza (official rules below). Good luck, and let the games begin. 

RULES 

The spons promotion people, 
including Judy Malone, Laurel 
Dean, John Riley, and the boys 
and girls in the AS, without a 
doubt have the toughest job on 
campus; gening athletic 
supponers imo the gym. I truly 
hope all their plans for the 
upcoming year are booming 
successes; it's the kind of shot in 
the arm this school needs. (Drug 
testing is something wc'll talk 
about later.) It sure makes 
covering the games more 
exciting when there's a raucous 
(if not roaring) crowd on hand . 
UCSD does suppon winners; 
now let's see about everybody 
else . 

• • • 
You may be wondering: "Gee, I

Continued from page 41 
many as a milestone, nOt only for 
the soccer program, but also 
UCSD athletics. A large crowd 
filled the Warren Field bleachers 
and sidelines, an alanming 
number considering the 
lukewarm response the soccer 
team traditionally receives. The 
joyous, raucous crowd became 
part of the victory celebration , 
which included carrying 
Armstrong off the field on the 
shoulders of his triumphant 
players. As good as that crowd 
was, Armstrong thinks they still 
could have done bener. 

"In a way, we worked so hard 
that we expected it to be a 
decem crowd, and from our 
poim of view, it wasn 't really a 
lOt," renected Armstrong. "We 
expcted more, to be honest, but 
it 's the kind of thing we'd like to 
do again . 

Armstrong's big goal is to 
create enthusiasm about UCSD 
soccer. "A lOt of people play 

intramural soccer in the college ," 
said Armstrong, "and if we can 
get the word out, I think people 
will come out to see the games." 

Enthusiasm may soar if UCSD 
stays in the playoff hunt come 
the second half of the season. 
From October 1 until the end of 
the season , the Tritons will be a 
team of homebodies, playing the 
rest of their games at home , with 
the exception of one match at 
the Universiry of San Diego. 

This bit of shrewd scheduling 
has obvious benefits. "That's 
going to be a lot easier on the 
players for traveling and will put 
us in a hell of a position with all 
the home games: said 
Armstrong. "I think that could be 
one of the factors if the college 
gelS behind us. The players then 
will get a wee bit of confidence 
and could very well take olT." 

Can UC D repeat the magic 
of last year? Armstrong won't 
make any predictions, but he 
thinks they have a shot. ·We'ye 
got a little experience on the 
team and I think we'll come 
together at the nght ri me. But 
one thing's for sure, we 're gOlllg 
to need the ollege b hand u~ to 
help us out." ~ 

Women's soccer 
Continued from page ..0 
Leaney expected . "I thought we 'd 
come back 2-2, but three wins is 
an unexpected surpnse." 

Leany has seen some 
unexpected surprises in his two 
years as the team's coach. He 
took over the Triton's while he 
was working as a coach for the 
Mission Bay Soccer Club, and 
has been a big reason why 
women's soccer has nourished . 

"When I arrived, we didn't 
have much talent. but there was 
a keen interest," said Leaney. "I 
didn't recruit that first year 
mainly because I didn't know the 

rules of the game. But once I 
started doing that , I was able to 
get some really talented athletes. 
I now have people I can bring 
off the bench, something I 
couldn't do before." 

O'Connell , a senior from 
Tustin, in her third year as a 
player, has seen the vasr 
improvement of the learn. "We're 
so much bener than when 1 first 
came here: said O'Connell . This 
year alone we ha~ a lot of talent 
in the freshmen. We are playing 
good right now.~ 

Although there are se~ral 

young players on the squad , it's 
veterans O'ConneU. two-ume 
MVP Adriene Clark, and Chris 
Ladish who provide the core tat 
Leaney has built around . Some of 
the other players Leaney hopes 
to see good things .from are Toni 
Krumme ("an outstanding 
defender") ~d goalie Heather 
Mclssac, a transfer from San 
Diego State . 

A new Division UI pla)Off 
system, similar to the one held 
for [he men 's division, will take 
plac [his year for the first time, 
and Leaney, a member of the 
regional selection committee, 
thinks his team has a good shot 
at making the pla)Offs. "If we 
play the kind of soccer we're 
capable of, well be in the 
playoffs: -GS

UCSD must have been built 
with the cross-country track team 
in mind. No campus could be 
better suited for a team running 
long distances over uneven 
terrain. You could get dizzy just 
looking at a topography map of 
the school. There are the steep 
inclines and dips that help breed 
the skateboard community. The 
walk down to Central Library is 
through the ShelWood Forest. 
Plus, all the dirt trails explain 
why we have aJohn Muir 
College. 

Although the natural 
surroundings exist, it's still going 
to be an uphill banle for the 
1986 UCSD cross-country team, 
and head coach Andy Skief 
remains a bit cautious about 
predicting his team performance 
this year. 

"From the individual progress 
made by the runners over the 
summer, 1 hope to have an 
improved team from last year, 
but it is still a rebuilding year for 
us," said Skief. 

Chris McMatt is one of several 
runners that Skief hopes will 
bring a stronger showing for 
UCSD from last year's team 
which finished third in the 
NCAA Division UI Regionals. 
"Chris McMatt was probably our 
fourth or fifth runner last 
season," said Skief. "He's had a 
good summer of running and 
weight training, and I have good 
expectations from Chris this 
)'Car." 

Kevin Culver, Jan Barglowski, 
Aaron Cooley and David Bonds, 
who sat out last year with a knee 
injury, are the nucleus of the 
men's squad, bUl Skief is hoping 
another source will strengthen 
his team. "There's possibly some 
good freshmen coming in who 
can help us out: said Skief. 

Some good runners may 
emerge from a wave of freshmen 
girls on the women's side, but 
Skief isn't about to mention any 
names so none of these runners 
have any pressure on them 
before the season Starts." 

A pair of sophomores, Sabrina 
Jensen and GiseDe English, a 

. junior duo, Mal}' Siefert and 
Andrea Veatch, and a lone 
senior, Erica Rothenburg, are the 
aces up Skiers sleeve. But the 
road to the regionals for these 
women is, according to Skid, 
based on each individual runner 
performing to her standards. 
"Everyone knows what they have 
to do," said kid. 

Performing up to standards 
includes a regimen that Cram 
and OVClt would find punishing. 
Runners must train at the rate of 
55-60 miles a week until the end 
of the season , when It tapers off 
to about 40 miles weekly. 

Cross-country is not a great 
spectator sport, and it's never 
going to surpass bowling in 
popularity. So why do these 
athletes go through thiS grueling 
training for seemingly small 
rcwards? "It creates diSCipline in 
an athlete," said kicf. "Cross-
oumry is a real discipline sport. 

Individuals must know how to be 
tough memally and phy:'1 ally , as 
well as know how 10 negotiate 
thc terrain "
