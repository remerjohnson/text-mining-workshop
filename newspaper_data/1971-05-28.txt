_ Help for Financial Aid Program 

Debbie Lavender 
Stoff Wr iter 

At the urging of AS Pre ident Mike Palcic. the 
Academic Senate directed it Executive and 
Policy Committee to look into mean of helping 
out the Financial Aids Program. The motion 
came after a lengthy speech by Palcic in which 
he urged the faculty's aid for that program. 
along with two other problem : student 
participation in departmental affair ' and the 
future of the Coast Cruiser bu . 

The action came at la t Tue day's enate 
meeting which came to order at 3:50 p.m.-20 
minutes late-after rounding up enough 
member to obtain a quorum. Palcic took the 
floor almo t immediately after preliminarie . 

Help Requested on Cri i 

members. three or four tudent repre entallve 
hardly con tltute a power play on the part of the 
tudents ! " 
Palcic concluded hi talk with a warmng to 

the facull\' that if the tacult\' doe not increa e

Crui er. the bu Will be faced with financial 
failure in the fall. " The bu run three limes 
each morning and evening a far north a 
Cardiff. and ha b en dOing "terrible bu -me 
according to Palcic. 

Non-di crimination upported 

In another matter. the Senate voted to expre 
It upport for the non-di cnminallon poltcy put 
torth la t November by lJC Pre Ident Char Ie 
Hitch. Thl re olulion \\:a made in light of HEW 
critici m of the niver ity of Michigan with 
regard to dl crimination in hinng practice on 
ground of ex Pre Ident Hitch 's re olution 
lates. in part : 

Members of the Anomaly Factory ballet class 
demonstrate various positions they have 

learned this quarter. The class meets in the gym 
from 5 to 6:30 p.m. on Monday and Wedne days. 

Palcic a ked the faculty if they wouldn 't try to 
help alleviate the financial aid cri i in some 
way, and suggested that they might aid the 
newly-founded Coordinating Council on 
Financial Aids through a letter-writing 
campaign to state and federal officials. He also 
urged the professors to upport the idea of a 
one-year increa e in the AS fee to establi h a 
special aid fund . and mentioned that the faculty 
might establish some similar emergency fund . 

It i the policy of the niver ity". to 
provide applicant and employee the 
right to equal employment opportunitie . 
The niver ity will not engage in 
discriminatory practice again t any 
per on employed or seeking employment. 
becau e of race. color. religion, marital 
statu , national origin. ex , citizen hip, or 
age. 

Dance, Mime, Light Shows The Senate then unanimou Iy pas ed the 
resolution recommending that its Executive and 
Policy Committee look into the cri is and try to 
find orne way to help , po ibly through 
increasing the faculty payroll deduction which 
already goes for financial aid . 

Anomaly Factory Expands, Changes The re olution was pa ed unanimously.

The Anomaly Factory now 
operates the ound and lighting 
for all movies and the majority 
of concerts on campus . 
According to director Dave 
Cunningham . the ervices by 
the Anomalv Factory 
members. who u e their own 
equipment. cost the sponsor of 
an event only one-third of what 
other audio:visual staff would 
cost. Cu nningham clarifies that 
a registered tudent 
organization connected with 
the Anoma lv Factory own it 
own equ ipment 'and ha 
different resources from the 
tudent-funded Experimental 

Theater. 

The em pha si of the 
Experi mental Theat r is 
changing t performances and 
special se rvice . savs 
Cunningham . In the area '01' 
pertormances. three types 
Ii 'led by Cunningham are 
street theater . indoor theater. 
and an outdoor portable 
theater . The last i' in the 
proc ss ot construction and it

In his paper titled "A

Cunningham declare ' that the

Cunningham writes . The 
audience will be involved on a

lighting effects create the

making object seem to 
disappear . 

perlormed in parks, hopping 
center . and on sidewalks. 

Education and Training 

Another area of actiVity 
Cunningham mentions i's 
educa tion and training 
pon ored by the Experimental 

Theater. A commitment of 20 
to 40 hour per week is 
required. he say . The 
performance member write 
their own drama as a total 
group effort. In the future . 
training will be even more 
re trictive and people who can 
stay with the theater for two or 
three year will be preferred. 

Palcic also brought up the issue of student 
participation in the various academic 
departments. Praising the way tudent 
involvement has worked out on the 
administrative level. he expressed the hope that 
thi could be achieved on the academic level as 
well. He a sured the faculty, a he did the 
Regents la t week. that the students do not 
intend to come in and take over the 
department . " In a department of 20 faculty 

The Senate Committee on Educational Pohc 
and Courses had recommended the pas age of a 
motion favoring a modified semester plan 
instead of the quarter system. The motion 
suggested a system of two semesters per year, 
one between Labor Day and the Christma 
holiday, and the other between the third week 
in January and the third week in May, with an 
eight-week ummer se ion. But the question 
wa never voted on : the Senate had 10 l It 
quorum again by then. 

Student leHer Campaign Efforts in the past months 
have been concentrated on 
technical effects. reports 
Cunningham . Electronic 
re earch and development is 
presently being conducted and 
will hopetully result in a 
computer setup to program 
both ound and lighting. He 
hopes that most of the 
technical arrangements will be 
completed over the summer 0 
that the Experimental Theater 
can concentrate on 
performances next .vear . 

York Predicts Financial Aid Crisis 

Th street theater differs 
from indoor theater becau e 
the performances of the latter 
" go to the audience. " rather 
than the rever e. There i no 

control ov r the environment 
with street theater. but one 
advantage i- that the audience

Keep F ith for Old UCSD 

Alumni Association Planned Here 
Robert Miller 
StaH Writer 

Development of a formalized UCSD Alumni Association is 
presently in the planning stage. 

At the moment, an informal association of some 100 dues-
paying alumni exists. However , according ' to Bob Smith, 
director of UCSD Gifts and Endowments. it is hoped a viable 
Alumni Association will be set up by next year. 

There are several different formals being contemplated for 
the final Alumni Association. The plan most discussed is lo 
separate the A sociation into individual chapters for Revelle 
grads. Muir grads, Third College grads, SIO grads, etc. 

Such a format is being strongly considered because 
graduates now seem to relate more to their individual interests 
rather than to their specific graduating class as in the past. 
said Smith. 

Saltman tates Importance 

Revelle Provost Saltman believes a formalized Alumni 
As ociation will be important to UCSD because such groups 
""are very positive in aiding and abetting the growth of the 
University. "" Revelle will have the bulk of the early 
As ociation members since it was the first college at UCSD 
besides SIO. 

Saltman placed the plans for an Alumni Association in 
relation to the relative youth of UCSD by saying. '" For so long I 
was worried about gelling out the first class and getting the 
program functiomng. but now, oh my god. we have to worry 
about eUmg up an Alumni As ociation!" 

Saltman noled that he does not expect such a group to really 
become active and helpful for at least ten years. but he added, 
""meanwhile we must keep the faith and a sen e of affection for 
the University." 

An important function of the Association will be to "create 
an atmo phere of continuity with the niversi ty and its 
continuing educational program for the alumni.· · according to 
Smith. He noted that such a program for thP alumni could take 
the lorm 01 Association- pon ored classes as is done by many 
Alumni Associations across the country. 

Muir Provo t Stewart said a profitable type of course for the 
alumni would cover world affairs or current events. "Such 
cour e would be a service to alumni because they would help 

them to keep their perspectives broad and to up·date their 
education helping them to become better citizens." He 
emphasized it is important not only for the alumni to do 
something for the University in terms of gifts, but it is also of 
great import for the University to do something for the alumni. 

Saltman agrees. He is concerned with the responsibility of 
the University to the alumni. " We want to know what we can 
offer for the graduated student in order to keep him up-to-date. 
We can do this through Extension classes and through the 
Alumni Association ." 

Both Saltman and Smith expressed great enthusiasm over 
the possibility the Alumni Association could serve as a central 
focus for gathering feedback on the University educational 
program. This would be possible because the Association 
would largely consist of people who have been away from 
UCSD for a few years. thus allowing them to view the 
University with their experience after leaving it in mind, 
explained Saltman. 

According to Saltman, such an evaluative feature of the 
Alumni Association would be invaluable. 

·· It is important to reach the graduates after they leave the 
University and to get a reading on our program. With this 
information. we can get three evaluative perspectives ; that of 
the present undergraduates. the student who ha just 
graduated. and the alumnus after being away from the 
University for three to five years ... 

Help With Current Events 

The Association will also help the alumni by keeping them 
informed of events related to the UCSD community and of 
activities that will take place here. According to Smith. this 
function of the A sociation will " help to continue old interests 
or even to open up new areas of interest that the alumni would 
po sibly pursue."" 

The traditional value of an Alumni Association is the gifts 
and endowments they provide the University. According to 
Stewart. the schola rships and gifts from wealthy alumni are 
important because they supply the institution with the " needs 
that are not funded by the state." 

However. some of the traditional function of the Alumni 
As ociation will be missing at UCSD. "The jock business of an 
Alumni Association i . of cour e. out. ·· stated Saltman flatl y.

UCSD Student Receives 
Miss Afro-America Title 

A UCSD student ha been chosen as Miss Afro-America . 
Deborah t Makia I Webb. a sophomore in Drama at Revelle, 
will travel to Chicago in September to take part in the National 
Congress of African Peoples. She plans to attend the University 
of Ghana next year as part of the UC Education Abroad 
Program. 

The third AfrO-American Beauty Pageant is sponsored by the 
Social Organization Work Council of the Congress of African 
People. The Work Council deals with "social development of 
the AfrO-American nation ." improving relations among 
Blacks. and aiding Blacks "back to their traditional greatness 
and .. .life style of a free people." according to Ken Carr. AS 
Commissioner of External Affair . 

Carr noted. " By all means. this pageant i not a competition. 
We as Black people should seek only to be complimentary to 
each other. We should strive to complete in each other those 
things which we lack. 

.. Black people for too long have accepted beauty standards 
that judged their magnificence as inferior," he added . "With 
the new awareness that has developed in Black pride, Black 
people are defining their standards for beauty based on a value 
system which defines beauty as a form and feeling that 
promises happiness. To bring happiness is to inspire. A 
beautiful Black woman is one who is inspirational to Black 
people .""

Regents Raise Late Fee to $25 
Debbie Lavender 

Stalf Writer 
Most dreaded and despised of all University fees . the late 

registration fee has been raised from $10 to $25 by the UC 
Regents . At their meeting last Friday in San Francisco, the fee 
increase was approved to cover the almost-doubled costs of 
proceSSing late registrants, and also to serve as a deterrent to 
late registration. 

In proposing the fee increase, UC President Charles Hitch 
noted that 12,600 students had registered late in 1970-71, which 
generated an incOme on $126.000. Based on projections of the 
same number of late registrations for 1971-72, the 
recommendation estimated that an income of $315 ,000 would be 
generated. 

Upon hearing of the increase, one clerk in the Scheduling 
Office, which bears most of the burden of late registrations, 
exclaimed. "We felt bad telling students to pay $lO-when it 's 
$25. we'll be embarrassed to say it! .. 

Associate Registrar Ronald Bowker. who opposed the 
increase idea when it was being considered by the state-wide 
registrars . thinks that it will not greatly affect this campus. 
'"There should be no reason for anyone to have to pay the late 
fee ," he said. "Students have until Sept. 28 to pay their fees, 
and that is quite a long time. They can pay by mail . so even 
illness should not prevent anyone from paying." 

Bowker feels that the campus registrars are not primarily 
concerned with generating income. since they do not expect to 
benefit greatly from it. They are interested in the increase as a 
deterrent. although Bowker does not believe it will discourage· 
any more late registrants than the $10 fee did . " Even if a 
student ha to pay late for some reason. he can easily get an 
emergency loan if he does not have the $25," he pointed out, 
""and we wait longer than any other campus before charging 
the late fee ." UCSD, unlike many other campuses, allows 
students to register through the second day of instruction. 

Extra costs and workload caused by late registrants involve 
primarily the computer used in registration. Bowker explains, 
"The computer can handle 5000 students on time for the same 
amount it costs to take care of 50 late ones. Computer time 
must be paid for. and a whole new program must be made up 
for late registrants as they come in. This is what costs." 

While the registrar 's staff agrees that a strong deterrent is 
needed . one member expressed great sympathy for the 
students. Margaret Sullivan. assistant registrar, said , '"I'm 
against the increase because 1 feel so sorry for the kids. I don 't 
see how they'll come up with $25 ; some can't even come up 
with 10." 

The Scheduling Office staff feels even more strongly. '" It's 
outrageous." they think. Theresa Scanlan. who is in charge of 
that office. says that the $10 fee was enough of a deterrent. 
"Late registrations do cause a certain amount of trouble . but

Twohy, AS Sacramento Lobbyist 
to Seek Summer Interns Tuesday 

ASUC Student Legislative 
Counsel Richard Twohy will be 
at the Tuesday evening AS 
Council meeting to discuss 
legislation and to recruit 
summer interns. Outgoing AS 
President Mike Palcic. who 
expects to leave office at the 
meeting slated for 7 p.m. at the 
Coffee Hut. told the TRITON 
TIMES the Council ha s 
appropriated 1200 to the 
legislative program which 
Twohv heads. 

Part of the allocation is to be 
used to enable two or three 
tudents to work with Twohy 

during the summer as interns. 
Palcic noted . He added that 
student interested in applying 
for the poSitions should write 

resumes listing their interest . 
ex pectations. ideas and . 
perhaps. qualifications. 

Palcic noted that since 
financial re ources are limited 
it is preferable that student 
taking posts as interns have a 
place to tay in Sacramento. 

After Twohy"s presentation 
to the Council. Palcic says. he 
expect Twohy to form a 
separate discussion group with 
students intere ted in the 
Legislative Program. 

The AS. according to Palcic . 
will go on to discuss the 
budget for next year. Palcic 
urged a II student who are 
concerned With the budget to 
attend .

Ecology 

Great Alaskan Rip-Off 
Jim Jacobson - Ecology Center 

even oil companies are about to embark on a 
project that will produce ecological di ' aster -
which will make the Santa Barbara and San 
Francisco oil pills seem like a drop in the 
bucket. Please make note here. this article is 
not meant to be objective. Ecology Center 
wishes to present the con ervationi t point 01 
view on the proposed pipeline .in Alaska. The oil 
industry has adequa te resources to gi ve you 
their side by flooding the media with messages 
of "concern" over the environment and the 
Alaskan natives. 

The Trans-Alaska Pipeline will carry oil 
heated to 180 degrees across nearly 800 miles of 
our last large remaining wilderness, from 
Prudhoe Bay in the north to Valdez, a year-
round ice-free seaportin the south. The National 
Environmental Policy Act required the 
Department of the Interior to report on the 
environmental impact of the project. 

Vast Disruption 

The report show that the pipeline will disturb 
countless species ot wildlife and va ·t wilderne s 
area,. Each mile of pipe will contain 500.000 
gallons 01 hot 011. which means that ever~' half 
mile ot pipe will contain the amou nt of oil 
pilled at Santa Barbara ~ In the Alaskan 

climate the eflects of an oil spill are far greater 
than In warmer areas. The fragile tundra 
landscape i . highly vulnerable because oil is not 
degradable. and will remain and pollute tor 
centuries. And Alaskan oil is of a particularl~' 
toxic t~' pe to liVing organisms. 

Among the liVing orl!'anlsms endangereq <ire 
the Eskimos. AkUl>. and Indian -the original 
owner, ot the land which was "bought " Irom 
Ru 'sla by the l . S. lnder the Alaska Statehood

The permafro t land -cape of Alaska is nearlr 

80 per cent frozen . Hot oi l in the pipeline can be 
expected to melt the frost. turning the ground to

earthquake zone where an is land in the harbor

Interior says that "saleguards" will be taken. 
but adds that " there is the probability that some 
oil spill will occur even under the mo t 
tringent condition ." 

Strong Pipe? 

How contident. we wonder. are the engineers 
about the strength of the Japanese pipe that was 
rush-ordered ',' A potential two million barrels ot 
oil per da~' will arrive via the pipeline at Valdez.

Necessary for Security 

The Department ot the Interior concluded 
that work on the pipeline should proceed

with the environment-which the report wa,

Comm Board 

Clarifying The Facts 
Craig Starr , 

Chairman-Communications Board 
I wish to correct some mi sinformation 

published in the current issue of DIMENSION 
concerning the Communications Board and 
Radio KSDT. In calling Mr. Keating about the 
items he "expo ed ." he told me he would stand 
on what he printed. He will have a long fall if he 
plans to stand on ' uch "facts." 

Item one : The Communications Board land I. 
as its chairman ' did not lie to anybody or 
committee concerning DIMENSION's request 
for tunding. The AS has not received our 
request. and the Registration Fee Committee 
received a budget statement that contained. as 
a detail item. the amount of our request. which 
was appropriated to DIMENSION, No other 
document was presented by us to anyone outside 
of the Comm Board itself. 

Item two : Contrary to DIMENSION's claim. 
KSDT will be conver'ted to an FM Broadcasting 
station dLri ng the coming year. The only thing 
we lack before preparing the FCC application is 
the permiSSion of the Regent . for which we are 
preparing an agenda item for the June or July 
meeting. The conversion to FM will be 
accomplished regardless of the level of 
opera tional funding ince epa rate funds for 
capital outlay were marked las 1 year by the 
Registration Fee Committee as the source they 
would use to support FM at KSD'T. The balance 
of needed fu nd s for the first stage (1971-72 1 ot 
the eonvers'on will be obtained by outside 
gra nts. i'io AS fees and no part of this year' 
opprational support from Registration fee used 
for FM conversion. I The balance of the 
conversion project will be taged over the 
following two to fou r ~'ea rs at a total cost equal 
to the first stage '. 

Item three : this brings us to a consideration 
of KSDT 's operational budget. It I considered 
distinct from the FM conver ion budget. and as 
a goal in its own right. becau se quality 
programming i ' a goa l which KSDT and the 
Communica tions Board pur 'ues whatever the 
broadcast mode. Mr. Kea ting claim the 
expanded budget does not provide tor expanded 
programming. But that is preCISely what the 
budget increa 'e in each department 
represents. 

Engineering and capital outlay areas provide 
for equipment and equipment maintenance that 
would increa e the station 's potential to do 
public aftai rs. production . live coverage. and 
speCial programming. :'Ilu ic department 
requests additional funds to expand the record 
library. ;'\ews department seeks the benet it of a 
wire ervlce to improve the news lormat 
I Rutgers. an internationally re pec ted wire 
service. comes at a lower f than ei ther of the 
major C. S. ervices. l PI and AP I. 

Even the much·bemoaned salarv level was 
designed to enabl departm nt directors. tho e 
With the heaViest work-loads. to put in even 
more time than the\' do currentl\': three ot 
these po ition were 'mcreased to allow lor 12-
month employment in tead 01 9·month since 
work needed to be done 0 er the summer at the 
studiO - work that ca n best b done while th 
tat ion is shu t down lor the summer 

break- would r quire th presence of the 
station manag r. the chi t engm r. and the 
program director, ,Ev n so. It still r mains that 
much of the time put in b~' th ~e p opl is 
voluntary. and an~' remunerallon they recclve I ~ 
far below ad quate compensation lor their tim 
investment '. I lallto s e h011 it can b clalmet! 
that these Increa"e 10 th operationa l budget 01 
KSDT do not repre nt an~' Increas In 
programm 109 and op('ratlOn ~ 

However. after all this is said and done- and 
here is the clincher-these figures do not 
represent the amount of money which KSDT has 
been given . They merely represent an " ideal 
budget request" which KSDT prepared 
according to the Registration Fee Committee's 
request to know the optimum spending levels 
for all entities requesting funding . And. even so, 
these figures were reduced in Comm Board 
subcommittee from the original request 
submitted by the KSDT executives. a procedure 
which was followed for all applications and 
budgets. When final budget allocations of the 
Registration Fee Committee and AS are made. 
a final budget for KSDT and for all Comm Board 
areas will be drawn up and published in the 
TRITON TIMES. 

Item four : The Board 's " infrequent 
meetings" to wHIch DIMENSION refers were 
held on the average every other week. The only 
thing infrequent was Mr. Keating 's attendance 
I part of two or three meetings all year I which 
leads me to wonder how he acquired the 
expertise and knowledge to present the "true" 
picture of KSDT to the campus (no. he has not 
been seen around KSDT all year I. 

Item live : Finaliy. there is the cry which Mr .. 
Keating has raised' all ~'ear long that the Board 
favor radical. I ftist. revo lutionary 
publ ications and is out to "sink" DIMENSION. 
As we hav.!' patiently tried to explain to him all 
year long. there has never been a time when the 
Comm Board resources were not strained . 
Therefore. where a publication has its own 
sources 01 income. we have insisted that these 
be used I irst. DIMENSION has a greater 
income from more source, than the other 
publications which applied to us for support thiS 
year. Interestingl~' enough. they would never 
reveal to u, exactl~· who thei r supporters arc. 
although th y claimed rather large income 
trom these sources I advertiSing was a small 
percentag '. DIMENSION d mands equal 
lunding with other publications: yet \\'hilc 
invoking eqUity as a principle, they suppl ied 

expense ligures more than three times the size 
of printing costs 01 the other publication,. 

Thl' tollowing IS exactly what the Board 's 
budget subcommlltee did : knowing that a papcr 
coulu reasonabl~' and with minimum quahty be 
produced lor much less than DIMENSION 
stated. the , ubcommillcc n:duced the expense 
level. Then. reasoning that it a dill ercnt 
production procedure were used ' non· 
prole,slonal la~out ' ,ome Income might b , 
:acriliced Irol11 thei r contributor". the 
subcommittee generous l~' reduced by one-hair 
the estimated income of DIMENSION Irom 
outSide sources The resulting balanc hetween 
reduced Income and reduced expense was $SOo. 
Thl, I\'a, the amount allocated to DIMENSION 
In th " Idea l" budget approved h~' the 
Communication Board . This same procedure 
wa, appli ed to the requests 01 all other non· 
ottl clal Journal:. : thcir slightly la rger 
allocations are a re, ult 01 their lower Income 
potential:. but all In all I think DIMENSION's 
treatm nt has h 'en more than lair sintc :VIr. 
Keatlng 's Income IS hardly likely to go down h.l· 
one-hall below h" budge t estimate. It . alt r thl ' 
attempt to be ju,t with all requesh at the same 
11m ' II ' mu,t be economical. :\11'. Keating and 
hI. . tall , till want to cn' "woll. · I can onll 
wggcst that In th tutur : th 'y tr.1 bing mort: 
open and hone,t with u, and 1011011' :, ,t

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Dimension and 
Diarrhea 
Editor: 

Si nce there is no other way to 
protest the non-paid. rion-
political advertisement 
purportedly taken out by our 
candidate in the periodical 
DIME SIO , we are bringing 
our complaint to you, 

We be l ieve it was 
unspeakable of DIMENSION to 
misquote our candidate as 
saying he had "a program to 
change our national course 01 
drift and disaster- aimless tog 
and mon oon" .. " What Mr. 
Kaufman actually said was " I. 
a spoke man for the Shepard 
Dynasty ' no relation to Ming ' 
and as a candidate tor 
Associated Students' President 
at the L'niversity ot California 
at San Diego. am striving to 
crea te a Weather MACHINE to 
successfull v freeze over the 
'diarrhetic: garbage spewing 
Irom the mouths of Karl 
Kealing and Jim Sills." 

We are very up et by this 
misquote and we are grievou 
that C. Starr Publications could 
publish a journal that is so ill -
informed.

Financial Aids 
Crisis 
Dear Editor : 

The federal government's 
1971-72 financial aids allocation 
will be $152,991 less than that 
budgeted for 1970-71. If we 
consider that UCSD alone will 
have 900 new Freshmen, 30 per 
cent of whom will require 
partial or total financial 
assistance , it become s 
apparent that needy students 
here face a crisis of terrifying 
dimensions, 

Even if you are not using 
Financial Aids. the current 
squeeze will affect you . .. With 
$108.685 dropped from the 
'ational Defense Student Loan 

program and another $55.063

A Miclsumm.r Night 
at til. Old Globe 

Lawrence E. Johnson 
Arts Wriltr 

Edilor's NOle: Larry Johnson hlls pUI in years 0/ service 10 Ihe TRITON 
TIMES, as a senior Arls itriler be/ore an Arls Deparlmenl exlsled on Ihe 
paper. We wish 10 Ihank him now/or hi~ long·lime dedicalion and work as 
he leaves UCSD, hllvingjusl been awarded a PhD. in Philosophy. 

Framed by the filigreed branches of the soaring eucalyptus 
trees. the :Vloorish tower can be seen. an enchanted minaret 
from the Arabian Nights. At one side the California moon is 
just clearing the tree. adding its own magic as a soft semi-
tropical breeze cools the summer evening. Below are the 
sounds of Elizabethan revelry. 

This is the San Diego i\ational Shakespeare Festival at the 
Old Globe Theater in Balboa Park. San Diego. Now in its 
twenty-second season. it has come of age as one of the world 's 
most respected Shakespeare festivals. It certainly has one of 
the most delighttul of theatrical locations . hidden among the 
garden and Moorish style buildings of the park. and it gives 
great theater to match. The Old Globe. with its Tudor 
architecture. is modeled after the playwright's own Globe 
Theater. It was built for San Diego's big California Pacific 
International Exposition back in the thirties. when it was the 
scene of numerous abreviated Shakespearean productions. In 
1949 the Festival was originated in its present form . and has 
since evolved to its current international stature. It starts June 
8 and runs all summer, but buy your tickets early so you can be 
sure of getting them. 

One of the reasons for the Festival's popularity is that it 
doesn 't just leave Shakespeare to the professors. He has a lot 
to offer to the modern audience, and the Old Globe allows him 
to speak to us . While they are true to the bard, they yet present 
original productions with insight, and sometimes with genius. 

Shakespearean comedies are always popular. and the Old 
Globe directors have traditionally had the gift of comedy. 
managing to breathe a very contemporary zest into the

dramatist's eternal plays. A hilarious history of an early 
attempt at women 's lib. Tbe Tam ... of tbe Sllrew ha~ been 
delighting audiences for centuries. Kate and ner tamer. 
Petruchio. will return to the Old Globe this summer with their 
strenuous exercise in inter-personal communication. 

More serious in tone is Antony and Cleopatra, a love-tragedy 
powered by the force of Shakespeare's incomparable 
psychological characterization. A mature play for mature 
minds. this is the sort of drama that the Old Globe actors are so 
well able to make come alive for the modern audience. 

They are serious artists. the actors and directors . creating 
drama which is substantial as well as entertaining. Aiding the 
professional troupers are a group of apprentices. working on 
scholarships. The festival thus serves to develop younger 
actors. while maintaining the highest professional standards. 
Often at the Old Globe we see artists who. like Victor Buono or 
William Ball. go on to national fame. i\ationally noted Ell is 
Rabb will be the director for thi summer's Antony and 
Cleopatra. 

A bIt of midsummer mirth and madness that never fails to 
leave audiences rolling in the aisles. A Midsummer Night 's 
Dream will bring its fairyland frolic to the Old Globe to 
complete the Festival tare . Balboa Park on a summer 's eve is 
the perfect setting for a delightful fantasy . where one could 
well imagine pucks cavorting through the woods. as well as on 
stage. 

To start the enchantment [ would suggest a pre-theater 
dinner or drink at the nearby Cafe del Rey Moro. Tastefully 
done in romantic Moorish architecture. it overlooks one of the 
most pleasantly wooded sections of the park . Since you have 
already left your car. it is only a two or three minute amble to 
the Old Globe afterwards. How can you help arriving at the 
thea ter in a good mood '~ 

Ju ' t to make sure that you are in the proper frame of mind 
for the dramatic festivities. there will be pre-theater 
entertainment in the Elizabethan manner on the green in front 
of the theater . A tradition as old as the Old Globe itself. the 
madrigal si nging and dancing on the green is almost worth the 
trip to the theater in its own right. Then . atop the banner 
bedecked theater the trumpets blow. the cannon di -charges. 
and the co tumed crier announces the evening 's bill . Curtain 
time!

Water Polo: a Wet Dream 
Rocky Halfon 
Spo rls Edi lor 

Last Sunday after hours of volleyball and softball I went to 
the pool to face the last challenge presented by Lee Johnson : 
coed water polo. The results? Great, terrific ... If you th ink 
coed volleyball and softball and anything aside from the real 
ball are good , you should try water gasp! Aside from being 
lImited to rather cumbersome innertubes, the three men and 
four women .(good odds) are free to do as they will , always 
keepmg ID mmd , that is, the penalties from the referee. 

There are two. main things you want to do in water polo : 1) 
get on a team With. good-looking girls ; 2) score. Luckily, most 
of the . mermaIds In water polo are good swimmers, which 
necess itates ~ood bod~es .. . The game is played in the pool. at 
least for the first 40 mlDutes. These 40 minutes are divided into 
four quarters, every second of which is a blast. 

The game is a bit tiring, with the innertube and all but no 
male Will ever admit to being pooped . Almost anyone 'can get 
the hang of the game; the ru les are the same as in regular 
water polo and usually after one quarter you have the "feel " of 
the ga~e. By the second quarter you find that the best way to 
score IS to Isolate a girl and then get the ball . The outcome is 
usually a goal. 

This week's honors go to Doug Cheshi re for his brilliant 
recrUltmg. Doug has in his wet little hand some of the best-
looklllg team members in the league. Thanks, Doug.

Saddle-up at Shadowland Ranch Stables 
Lauri. Gage 

Shadowland Ranch Stables, 
located at 9761 Blackgold Road . 
is a mere 15-minute walk from 
UCSD. yet many students have 
never noticed it. Shadow land 
has a spread of 20 acres. and 
has been there for over 20 
years. About one hundred 

horses are boarded there now, 
most of which are English 
hunters and jumpers, The land 
is owned by the niversity. and 
is leased to Augie Handley. who 
is the head trainer and runs the 
stable. 

In the summer Shadow land 
Ranch serves as a girls ' camp, 
Horse shows or riding clinics 

are held once a month. 
Shadowland 's facilities include 
six riding rings. two of which 
are used primarily for 
jumping: a cross-country jump 
course which is located in the 

. center of a mile long track; and 
three barn . 

The stable does not rent out 
horses ; however. English 

lessons are given every day 
except Sunday. There are five 
instructors and one saddle-
horse trainer. Two hundred and 
fifty children and adults are 
presently taking lessons . 
Lessons cost S4 an hour for 
beginners. $5 for advanced. and 
$6 for jumping. Until the first 
of the year UCSD students 
could get discounts. but these 
were di scontinued since .

niversity placed too many 
restriction on the stable ,

students board their horses at 
the stable. Board runs $65 and 
75 a month for outside corrals. 

and $90 a month for inside 
stall . Training costs $80 a
