Murder Convict 
Found Dead In C.II 
SAN DIEGO - Several 
months after being found 
guilty of murdering his 
girlfriend, Andres English-
Howard was found hung in his 
downtown jail cell last week, 
just one day before he was to 
be sentenced. English-Howard 
was convicted ~f first-degree 
murder in early August after 
admitting that he killed his 
live-in girlfriend - an SDSU 
student - while high on rock 
cocaine. English-Howard 
apparently used the bed sheets 
in his cell to make a noose. 
Although detectives are still 
investigating the incident, a 
suicide note left at the scene 
appears to confirm that he 
took his own life.

UCLA Retrofit 
Measur •• In Doubt 
LOS ANGELES - Following 
17 months of construction to 
bring Kerckhoff Hall up to 
earthquake safety standards, 
new scientific findings are 
casting doubt on the measures 
used to retrofit the building. 
The safety devices, called base 
isolators, are pads of alternat-
ing rubber and steel plates 
with thick lead cores. Carrying 
a price tag of $27 million, the 
entire retrofitting project is an 
expensive investment aimed at 
reducing future costs. How-
eve!, prominent seismologists 
questioned the potential 
damage that could result 
during earthquake movements 
and collisions between the 
building and the concrete 
walls used to keep the 
isolators in place.

A.S. Committee Votes Against Che Cafe 
Audit in Emergency Meeting Thursday 
COMPROMISE: Committee 
recommends financial review . 
and formal business plan . 
By Esther Yoon 
Staff Writer 

In an emergency meeting held last Thursday, 
the Co-op Oversight Committee voted against 
conducting an audit of the CM Cafe. 

In a unanimous decision, the committee rec-
ommended that the Associated Students (A.S.) 
and the Graduate Student Association (GSA) ac-
cept a financial review in lieu of an audit, and that 
the Che Cafe submit a formal business plan. 

"Considering the Che's financial status and the 
small size of its business, for them to do a full audit 
would do more harm than good," said Sujata 
Shende, chair of the Co-op Oversight Committee. 

"Doing a financial review and a business plan 

will allow them to adequately determine its sol-
vency," she added. 

The oversight committee's recommendations 
also includ~ extending deadlines for the Che's 
financial review to Nov. 15, and the business plan 
to Nov. 29. 

According to the Memorandum of Understand-
ing (MoU) - an agreement between A.S., GSA 
and the administration - an audit of all student-
run co-ops is required by the end of October. 

"The admi nistration really wants an audit from 
the Che, but we have pretty good reason to believe 
that its action will be limited to acknowledging or 
giving a warning about violating the MoU," said 
Sylvia Sfilgoi, an A.S. representative to the over-
sight committee. ' 

According to Sfilgoi, a financial review would 
cost between $700 and $1,200, while an audit 
would cost approximately $3,000. Sfilgoi said the

FemaleJ~er 
Attacked on 
Gilman Dr. 
GRABBED: Victim fights 
off early morning.assailant 
and escapes unharmed 
By Anand Patel 
Gusrrllan Reporter 

A woman who wished to remain anony-
mous was assaulted and nearly raped early 
Wednesday morning, according to the 
UCSD police department. The victim was 
jogging near the southern intersection of 
Gilman Dr. and Villa La Jolla Dr. when 
she was attacked. 

According to UCSD Police Sergeant Bob 
Jones, the waiting assailant grabbed the vic-
tim and tried to pull her to the ground. After 
a brief struggle, the victim broke free and 
ran to safety unharmed. 

Campus police were notified at 5:52 
a.m. when someone heard the jogger's 
cries for help. UCSD and San Diego Po-
lice were unable to locate the attacker, and 
they suspect he ran away after the woman 
escaped. 

Because the assault took place off-cam-
pus, the San Diego Police Department will 
continue the investigation. 

"Unfortunately, there exists a certain 
criminal element that preys on the vulner-
ability of others," Jones said. "A lone 
female jogging in the darkness provides 
these opportunistic cowards with a perfect 
target." . 

Jones said women should jog during day:' 
light hours. He added that ifthey must jog in 
the dark, they should run in pairs. 

This attempt comes less than three weeks 
after the alleged Oct. 1 rape, which occurred 
north of Marshall College. The victim in 
that incident has not made a formal police 
report. As of now, both cases remain un-
solved. 

Because of the recent rape attempts, sev-
eral UCSD women are taking classes that 
teach them to repel attacks, as well as pre-
vent them from occurring in the first place. 
One such class taught at RIMAC - Self-
Defense for Women - teaches participants 
both the physical and psychological aspects 
of self-defense. 

Warren freshman Ann Rosenbrock said 
the class enables women to get past their

review and the submittal oCa business plan. The Guardian regrets the error.

Cftess Game Highlights Family Day 
TRADITION: Parents 
and siblings gather for 
Saturday's activities

Guardian Reporter 

Approximately 300 parents and 
siblings of Muir college students 
participated in Saturday'S annual 
Muir College Family Day, the larg-
est crowd 10 attend I he event in 
several years. 

"We rejuvenated Ihe program 
aboullhree years ago, and this is the 
biggest number of parenls and sib-
lings we've had so far," said Muir 
Assislant Dean Vince Manson. 

Muir Provosl Patrick Ledden 
opened the day 's activities with the 
"Welcome and State of the College" 
address, speaking on issues such the 
internal changes facing UCSD and 
the new student·run cable TV sta-
tion. 

Ledden also add ressed the top-
10 national ranking for UCSD's 
graduate programs. 

"We are the only school founded 
in this century [in the top 10]," hesaid. 

"It is a remarkable ichievement. 
"In my view, the University of 

California, taken as a whole, is the 
greatest university in this country, 
probably the greatest university in 
the world," Ledden added. 

MuirDean Chips Dreilingerthen 
commented on the various Muir or· 
ganizations, programs and events, 
including the annual Halloween car· 
nival and pumpkin drop. 

A student panel also shared its 
various experiences as part of Muir 
organizations, such as the MuirThe-
atre Troupe, the Muir Cultural Soci-
ety, the San Diego Center for Chil-
dren and the Muir College Council. 

Following the student speakers 
was an Internet demonstration in 
the University Library and a tour of 
Center Hall by Professor of Biology 
Willie Brown. 

Muir band Aaron Molho and the 
Village Idiots gave a noontime con-
cert in the Muir Quad, while stu-
dents played a human chess game

cost of a financial review would be 

~no problem" for the Che. 
"The difference between hav· 

ing an audit done and a financial 
review mostly lies in the confi· 
dence interval," Sfilgoi said. "An 
audit goes through [financial 
records] thoroughly, while are· 
view will consist of things like 
check sampling." 

Last Monday, AS. President 
Naomi Falk and Vice President 
Administrative Jennifer Nicoll -
both members of the oversight 
committee - met with Joe 
Watson, vice chancellor of stu-
dent affairs, and John Francis, at-
torney for A.S. The meeting con-
cerned AS. 's liability for the Che 
Cafe in financial matters and up-
holding the MoU, Nicoll said. 

Failure to submit an audit and 
violation of the ~oU raised con-
cerns regarding future negotiations 
between AS. and the administra-
tion, especially regarding an au-
tonomous student body. 

NEWS 3 

A report of Monday's meeting 
with Watson, where they expressed 
support for an audit, was submit-
ted at Wednesday's A.S. meeting. 

Two informal and non-binding 
"straw polls" taken at the AS. 
meeting favored a financial review 
rather than an audit. 

One "straw poll" showed 19 
councilmembers in favor of a re-
view, none for an audit and five 
abstentions. Another poll for a 
business plan had 12in favor, three 
against and 10 abstentions. 

"I think that A.S. is going to 
approve a review,given the results 
of the straw polls taken and the 
support for the Che Cafe within 
the council," Falk said. 

"We were concerned with our 
liability for the Che and the audit, 
but as long as we follow procedure 
everything should be OK," she 
said. 

A final vote on the Che audit is 
scheauled for next week's AS. 
meeting. 

Editor's Note: A story in the 
Oct. 19 issue of the Guardian 
incorrectly reported that the A.S. 
supported an audit 0/ the CM

error.

Id EuthantUia a Right to ControL 
One d Body, or a Threat to 

America d MedicaL Practice? 

Doctors and Society Have Obligation to Persevere 
and to Search for Cures 

J ust two months ago, Dr. Jack Kevorkian - oth-erwise known as "Dr. Death" - assisted in 
yet another case of 

euthanasia, bringing his death count 
to 25. His actions and his ardent sup-
pert of euthanasia, also known as 
doctor-assisted suicide, have touched 
off a furious and divisive debate. This 
dispute has caused the whole citi-
zenry, laymen and professionals 
alike, to passionately question the 
content and consequences of this is-
sue. 

rhetoric, both of these assertions are 
clearly false: A physician's duty is 
to care for those who are terminally 
ill and suicidal. 

In fact, the vast majority of people 
attempting suicide don't really want 
to die - their self-abusive actions 
are actually desperate cries for help. 
Instead of accommodating and es-
sentially encouraging hopelessness 
by giving people the "right to die," 
society should be primarily con-
cerned with helping them in the 
struggle to live. 

The religious and cultural elite 
should make greater efforts to sup-
port and publicly urge the terminally 
ill to continue to fight for life. And 

we ~hould recognize Kevorkian and 
his ilk for what they are - unrelent-
ing predators who target the troubled 
and terminally ill and push them over 
the brink, like someone who encour-
ages a person on the ledge of a build-
ing to jump. Killers like Kevorkian 
dupe their "patients" into believing 

. the "death with dignity" rationale, 
that doctor-assisted suicide is a rem-
edy for pain. But what these people 
really need is reassurance from fam-
ily, friends and community that true 
dignity is to continue living. 

Furthermore, the physician has 
always had a specill relationship and 
duty to his patients: to nurture, care 
for and maintain their health and to

hen confronted with su.ffering and 
pain, Dr. Charlotte Gilman chose 

euthanasia. And while It may be dif-
ficult to understand the reasoning, her 

choice must be respected. Euthanasia 
is a private decision which belongs to the individual 
and not the law. Legal restrictions against assisted death 
violate our most basic rights of privacy, denying us the 
freedom to live by our own choice and morality. 

The Euthanasia Society says that euthanasia "would 
permit an adult person of sound mind, whose life is end-
ing with much suffering, to choose between an easy 
death and a hard one, and to obtain medical aid in imple-
menting that choice." If a person does not explicitly 
choose euthanasia with a clear mind or by a living will, 
then his wish is questionable. When the wishes of the 
suffering are even slightly IInclear, we must exercise 
caution. The critical foundation for euthanasia is that 
its use is in accord with the patient's desires. Individual 
choice is mandatory within the proper definitian of eu-

COMMENTARY: 'Freedom City' actually had nothing to do with freedom at all; rather, it was a collection of 
ignorant and misled students protesting complex issues which they didn't fully understand 

THE ULTIMATE IRONY: FREEDOM CrI'Y 
By F.,..m ShH.b 
Special to the Guardian 

Last wc:.ek., an event of tragic 
proportions befell UCSD and 
many other universities across the 
state. In an insipid throwback to 
the political demonstrations of the 
196Os, some so-called representa-
tives of "the people" temporarily 
converted the Price Center into a 
left-wing, ideological free-for-all, 
insidiously labeled "Freedom 
Cily." At this last symbolic, Uto-
pian vestige of "freedom, "throngs 
of students convened to stand on 
"equal" ground - Caucasians and 
minorities alike, coming together 
in the spirit of egalitarian cama-
raderie. 

What transpired at this osten-
sibly good-natured event was a 
veritable pissing-contest with "the 

~an. " What could have been a fo-
rum to address the various issues 
at hand instead became a call-to-
arms rally, contrived to incite an-
ger and polarize the campus. The 
claptrap spewed from the sancti-
monious pulpit left no question as 
to the motivation for the event: the 
annihilation of modern society. 

And with the political grace of 
terrorists, the event's supporters 

wholeheartedly set out to give the 
community the largest browbeat-
ing since the Gulf War protests. 
Just as children must resort to 
noisy displays for attention, so too 
did these political gadflies. This 
event was a catch-all for an entire 
soiree of progressive issues cur-
rently on the table - a hodge-
podge of everything and anylhing 
anti-West. It was an ironic posi-
tion for tbose who deem all cul-
tures to be equal, and thus outside 
the realm of moral judgment. 

No big 'deal, though. Consis-
tency has never been the hallmark 
of this type of activism - and 
neither has sincerity, honesty nor 
reason. in facl, what drives such 
so-called free-thinkers is not 
thought at all. Rather, it is un-
grounded, free-floating emotion, 
with rationllity trailing in a dis-
tant second. 

What passes right in front of 
the clouded eyes of these activists 
is that all the convictions they hold 
are neith~r radical, new, alterna-
tive nor proactive. To add insult 
to their injury, they are oblivious 
to the fact that they are II a major 
modern university - a bastion of 
the very philosophies which tbey

of the event, the primary problem 
was the idea set forth. 
WIuIt I. fNedo.? 

Rantings on everything under 
the liberal sun - the "injustice" 
of the regents' ruling on affirma-
tive action, the" invalidity" of 
Columbus Day, the "rampant op-
pression" of minorities and the 
"ongoing" problem of Western 
colonization - comprised the in-
tellectual backdrop of the event. 

A very distorted and unclear 
concept of freedom seemed 10 be 
the main idea. But it is the activ-
ists' notion of freedom that is at 
the root of their problem. Al-
though they could never provide 
a straightforward definition of 
what freedom is, the activists 
would inevitably define it in terms 
of some positive value. To them, 
it is a right to something: to food, 
to wealth, and to an education. In 
the absence of such things, then, 
freedom musl not exist. Their ar-
gument assumes that these things 
exist as natural resources, and thus 
are the natural providence of ev-' 
eryone. 

On the contrary, however, such 
freedoms exist only through Ihe 
work of individuals. So any such 

doctrine of enlitlement assumes a 
right to the fruits of these people's 
labor, which does nol result in any 
sort of freedom for anyone. Free-
dom properly defined in a politi-
cal context is of negativt value. It 
is the absence of a controlling 
force in one's life. 

For this reason, my advice to 
those involved with the event is to 
stop with the boondoggling and go 
home. These people have probably 
put li~t1e or no serious thought into 
the convictions they chose to make 
public. Ifthey had, they would not 
have been in the Price Center say-
ing things like, "There has been a 
melhodical, purposeful and delib-
erate aclion to keep people of 
color and women from benefiting 
from the society 10 which they 
contribute. " They seem 10 lake as 
self-evident the premises upon 
which their arguments are based, 
proving Ibat Ihey do nor wish 10 
fully understand the issues. Their 
motivation is clearly based on 
emotion, not reason.

THEATER MAKES COLLE.GE WORTH THE COST 
Editor: 

I enjoyed reading Derek van 
Hoften 's article in Monday 's issue 
of the GUIlrdian ("College Educa-
tion Not Worth Investment of Time 
and Money," Oct. 16, 1995). Many 
of the situations you mentioned are 
indeed true. Many students tend to 
slide by and miss the terrific train-
ing for life provided by UCSD. It's 
too bad they have not discovered 
theater. 

Here is a quick hit list of skills, 
traits and qualities of personality 
that are usually well-developed in 
individuals who complete four years 
of undergraduate theater training. 
These skills are great preparation for 
jobs - and Iife - not found in other 
areas of study: oral communication 
skills; creative problem-solving 
abilities; motivation; willingness to 
work cooperatively; ability to work 
independently ; time-budgeting 
skills; initiative; promptness and 
respect for deadlines; acceptance of 
rules; ability to learn quickly; re-
spect for colleagues; respect for au-
thority; adaptability; ability to work 
under pressure; development of a 
healthy self-image; acceptance of 
disappointment; self-discipline; 
goal -oriented approach to work; 
concentration; dedication to work 
and training; willingness to accept 
responsibility; leadership skills; and 
self-confidence. 

Given what I have seen in stu-
dents and life outside of theatre, 
these traits ace well worth four 
years of study at whatever the 
price.

I find Tedd Ladd's elitist, sim-

plistic and incorrect y iew of people 
without a college education repul-
sive ("Students Learn Valuable Life 
Experiences Outside of Classroom," 
Oct. 16, 1995). Unfortunately, this 
view of the world is shared by many 
here at UCSD and is one of the rea-
sons that UCSD students are 
thought of as uppity snobs by oth-
ers in the San Diego community. 
Your argument that one would find 
no competence except from those 
with a college degree is an amazing 
opinion for one to hold, and it is 
obviously wrong. 

If Ross Perot and Bill Gates are 
not representative, that still leaves 
three-fourths of the population in 
the United State~ . If you think ev-
eryone without a degree is incom-
petent, you have probably always 
assumed that the hard-working, 
savvy and thoughtful people with 
whom you 've dealt have had de-
grees, while the incompetents do 
not. This is an unfair and specious 
assumption. It is not diffic.1Ilt to 
point out the blunders or the sup-
posedly educated. 

As a senior at UCSD, I am on 
my way to medical school. I was 
also fortunate enough to have grown 
up in a rural area where the level of 
formal education was low. It is ob-
vious to me that the high degree of 
intelligence, competence, depth of 
understanding and clarity of pur-
pose of many of those from my

Editor: 

In his oommentary "College Edu-
cation Not Worth Investment of Time 
and Money" (Oct. 16, 1995~ Derek 
van Hoften complains that his educa-
tion will not prepare him for a career. 

Yet, there is a parallel between 
an education and a career. 

Students have to learn to focus 
on the process of working rather 
than on the information they learn. 

Successful enterprises are created 
and sustained by making the best use 
of limited money, time and resources. 
People in leadership positions are 
trained to do many tasks - irrelevant 
tasks, tasks in which they have no in-
terest or knowledge and tasks which 
are inundated with conflicting dates, 
times and information. 

These are things that van Hoften 
doesn 't like about his college edu-
cation. However, by successfully 
completing college, students will 
have learned to manage all those 
conflicts. The process is the lesson.

tainted by a tone of sensational-

as "senior co-op members refused 
to go on record," "unsure," 
"wished to remain anonymous," 
"for reasons unexplained," "un-
certain" and "no one could say" 
do not represent the incident ac-
curately or professionally, but in-
stead cloud it with implications of 
incompetence and mystery.

separating line between manage-
ment responsibilities and func-
tioning labor. The store is run col-
lectively and, although responsi-
bilities differ from member to 
member, there is no hierarchy or 
power structure within the store. 
This makes the cooperative busi-
ness unique and egalitarian. The 
few members who were inter-
viewed desired anonymity to 
maintain the balanc~ of responsi-
bility and wished to represent the 
store as a whole, not as individu-
als. 

During the interview, it was 
made clear to the reporter why the 
deposit was not taken to the bank 
on Monday, Sept. 25. It was not 
"for reasons unexplained." The 
Guardian also roported that "the 
store's insurance will not cover the 
burglary, the co-op will ha.ve to 
take the theft as a loss." Fo'rtu-
nately, however, the store's insur-
ance does cover the burglary and 
will help recover the loss.

Editor:S- Note: The Guardian stands 
by its story. According to the 
reporter:S- notes, the General Store 
did not give a specific explanation 
for the deposit not being talcen to 
the bank., and it also said tlwt the 
theft would not be covered by insur-
ance. The use of "wished to remain 
anonymous" and "refused to go on 
record" are journalistic rules which 
are followed when persons do not 
wish to be named in a story or do 
not wish to go on the record with 
their comments.

Privacy is an integral

ContlnlNd from pag. 4 
thanasia. Choice is what distin-
guishes euthanasia from murder. 

The right to choose what hap-
pens to one's body is a critical com-
ponentoffreedom.ln Union Pacific 
Railroad v. Botsford (1891), the 
U.S. Supreme Court stated: "No 

cine with the creation of his oath , 
which is DOW IDIJIdalory for an d0c-
tors. The oath states: "The health of 
my patient will be my first consid-
eration ... I will not use my medical 
knowledge contrary to the laws of 
humanity ... I will neither give a 
deadly drug to anybody, if asked for, 
nor willi make a suggestion to this 

"effect." 
This secure physician-patient 

right is held more sacred, or is more 
carefully guarded by the common 
law, than tJle right of every indi-
vidual to the possession and control 
of his own person, free from all re-
straint or interference by others, 
unless by clear and unquestionable 
authority of the law." 

Our bodies are all that we truly 
own and have the natural right to 
control. Governmental and societal 
interests are not tantamount to indi-
vidual control of one's body. 

The UCSD 0uanIian 

relationship is now an ClllCntial put 
of the moral fabric and foundation 
of society. However, Kevorkian and 
his followers threaten to usurp it 
with a sinister and auspicious phi-
losophy, which dictates that the 
doctor's oniy relation to the patient 
is to assist in his suicide, acting IS 
an executioner of sorts. 

Consequently, if laws permitting 
active euthanasia were introduced 

In Griswold v. Connecticut 
(1965), the U.S. Supreme Court rec-
ognized privacy as a constitutional 
right. The precedent from Ihis case 
protected individuals from invasion 
of their privacy as long as the state's 
public interests were not abridged. 
Both of these Supreme Court rul-
ings guarantee the right to privacy, 
giving people freedom to control 
their own bodies. 

Euthanasia is a private decision 
which does not violate the public 

into 1OcieIy, it is not implauaiblc that 
over time there would be an ~ 
ing deaenaitization 10 the worth, dig-
nity and sanctity of human life. S0-
ciety in general might increasingly 
move in the direction of involuntary 
euthanasia: killing defective new-
borns, the mentally retarded and all 
others who cannot consent. 

A disturbing historical precedent 
of this already exists: During the 

interest. Personal decisions which 
do not endanger society or infringe 
upon the rights of others do not need 
regulation. But all too often, privacy 
is respected only when an 
individual 's decisions conform to 
those of mainstream society. Many 
Americans do not accept euthana-
sia as a viable or moral option to 
ending a life of suffering. But why 
should the moral code of some 
Americans infringe upon an

CHOICE: 
Religion should not 
dictate American law 
Continued from pace 7 
Vatican's 1980 Declaration of Eu-
thanasia stated, in part, "Intention-
ally, causing one's own death, or 
suicide ... is equally wrong as mur-
der; such an action is considered as 
a rejection of God's sovereignty and 
loving plan." 

Thomas W. Clark, of the Insti-
tute for Naturalistic Philosophy, 
writes that the Vatican's denial of 
euthanasia "asserts not so much a 
right to life as an obligation to ex-
ist, no l1.latter what the cost." Clark's 
criticism of the Vatican's stance on 
the issue demonstrates that not all 
people disagree with euthanasia. 
The criticisms of Clark and many 
others raise questions about the 
weight which religion should hold 

cry, all of which occur more often 
than one might think. We are all fal-
lible human beings and none of us 
can forsee the future. It would be 
the height of arrogance and pre-
sumption for anyone - patient or 
doctor - to conclude that there is 
no hope for a cure or recovery. 

The sad irony of the growing 
utilization of euthanasia is that it 
comes at a time when modern 
medicine has reduced the amount 
of pain we have to bear to a level 
which would have shocked our an-
cestors. Before the Industrial 
Revolution, the absence of pain in 
people's daily lives would have 
been considered remarkable and 
noteworthy, because there were 
simply no treatments for most 

in blanket decisions regarding eu-
thanasia. 

What if someone does not wor-
ship the same God as the pope? 
What if someone's God specifies 
that dying peacefully is an alterna-
tive to dying with suffering? Ca-
tholicism does not represent all re-
ligions, and the pope does not rep-
resent all Americans: Many reli-
gions either take no public position 
on euthanasia or support individual 
decision, such as the Unitarian Uni-
versalist Church, United Presbyte-
rian, United Methodist and the As-
semblies of God. 

Regardless of the number of 
churches which support or de-
nounCe the use of euthanasia, spe-
cific religious dogma should never 
become the law for all citizens. 
Religion, as well as the moral

physical afflictions. 
Anyone with a sense of history 

can clearly see that this relatively 
recent emphasis on euthanasia as 
a solution to pain and suffering is 
indicative not only of a medical 
crisis, but more importantly of a 
deep-seated moral crisis. If our an-
cestors could persevere and sur-
vive daily physical pain during 
medically primitive times, then 
euthanasia in the present time 
seems to be the twisted result of a 
self-indulgent and privilege~ so-
ciety. 

Euthanasia is always the wrong 
choice - not just because it de-
stroys life, but because it con-
sumes the greatest thing which 
humanity has: hope. 

morality of any given religion. We 
need to concern ourselves with 
protecting the freedoms of all 
people, rather than forcing indi-
viduals to live by the moratit,- of 
others. 

By forcing a foreign and un-
welcome morality upon an indi-
vidual, we deny him the right to 
self-determination. The right for 
individuals to choose how they 
want to live - and die - must 
be respected. Prohibiting euthana-
sia eliminates choice and freedom 
in the ultimate form of self-deter-
mination. 

The attraction and pride of 
America is the freedom to determine 
how one will live. It is a tradition to 
reject any government restriction 
upon individual choice, even when 
it conOicts with the will of the ma-
jority. We battled against tyranny for 
national freedom and must continue 
to do so for individual freedom.

FREEDOM: Racism 
plagues poltical activists 
on the left-wing 

ing tbat those who celebrate Columbus Day 
are - due to tbeir race - oblivious to the 
genocidal Europe.n expansionism which 
followed Columbus' discovery. They also 
take issue with tbe assertion that be actu-
ally discovered the Americu, a fact that 
supposedly disregards the millions of indig-
enous peoples already occupying the lands.

condition of which is "ethnic diversity. ft A

But the issue is not one of Columbus ver-

riety is itself a contradic-
tion. This brand of multi-
perspectivism is itself a 
single perspective - due 
to its structure, it elimi-
nates other perspectives. 

However, this is sec-
ondary to their notion that 
a diversity of races equals 
a diversity of thought. 
This can only be true 
when one believes that 
race determines identity 
and thus the make-up of 
one's ideas. Here, racism 
has reared its ugly head, 
and - surprise, surprise 
- it's coming from those 
who claim to be its vic-
tims. There is definitely a 
race problem in this coun-
try: Far too many people 
are racist, and a lot of 
them are on the left. 

What multiculturalists 
really want is not a vari-

sus the natives. The celebra-
tion of Columbus Day is 
simply the acknowledgment 
of Columbus as a crucial 
causal link between what 
existed then and what exists 
now. The holiday does not 
mean that Columbus was 
the first man to set foot on 
this land - it is not glori-
fying the individual. It is 
simply recognizing that his 
achievements are what 
brought this country into 
existence. How unusual is it 
for a nation to celebrate an 
event that fomented its in-
ception? 

Overall, the common 
idea underpinning the activ-
ists' event became very ob-
vious at "Freedom City" -
the deconstructing of mod-
ern society. In their moves 
to eschew mainstream 
America and to bring about 
an alternative form of civi-

ety of views. They want rheir view and, if 
possible, only their view, regardless of what 
the truth actually is. 

lization, I ask them to consider this: Where 
in the world does the highest concentration 
of freedom exist? Last time I checked, it 
Was in the West - which is neither a geo-
graphic nor racial designation, but rather a 
metaphor for freedom and reason. 

CelebratInl Columbus 
A third purpose of Freedom City was to 

·undermine the credibility of a celebration 
for Christopher Columbus' discovery of the 
Americas - which is essentially a very re-
actionary type of reverse ethnocentrism. 
The celebration of Columbus Day to them 
is unobjective ethnocentric behavior, imply-

Fonner UCSD Physics Chair Drowns 
DEAIH: Victim was a 
pioneer in fusion 
plasma physics 
By SUketu.V".hn.v 
Guardian Reporter 

Dr. William 8, Thompson. pro-
fessor emeritus and former chair of 
the UCSD physics department, 
drowned last Tuesday while swim-
ming near the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography (SIO) pier. 

A local surfer spoiled Thompson 
entering the water at approximately 
3:40 p,m. Twenty minutes later, the 
surfer reported seeing a body float-
ing face down in the water. The 
surfer then called lifeguards from a 
phone on shore. 

Paramedics tried unsuccessfully 
to revive Thompson, and - after an 
autopsy - the San Diego County 
Medical Examiner'sOfflCCconfirmed 
the cause of death to be drowning. 

Thompson, who had been teach-
ing at UCSD since its inception in 
1965. retired and obtained hisemeri-
tus status in 1990, He served as 
chair of the physics department be· 
tween 1969 and 1972, 

"As one of the early members of 
the physics department here at 
UCSD, (Thompson] played a major. 
role in building the teaching and 
research excellence of Ihe depart-

him a "Renaissance man." 

"He wu not only an excellent 
physicist, but also a penon with 
wide ranging interests and very 
broad culture," O'Neil said. 

A pioneeroffusion research, Th~ 
ompson devoted his life to develop-
ing a theory of plasma pbysics and 
how it might be applied to the inven-
tion of a controlled fusion reactor. 

After fusion technology was no 
longer a national secret in 1958, 
Thompson made it his personal goal 
to bring the new field of research to 
British universities. He became 
England's first professor of plasma 
physics when Oxford University 
established a chair in the field. 

He was also the head of a small 
group of theoretical scientists during 
the 195Os, which later formed the 
renowned Culham Laboratory for 
Controlled Thermonuclear Fusion. 

His work led many in England to 
consider him the "fatherH of fusion 
plasma physics. 

Born in Belfast, Ireland, on Feb. 
27, 1922, Thom~n received both 
his bachelor of arts degree in phys-
ics and mathematics, and his master 
of arts degree in physics from the 
University of British Columbia, 
Vancouver in 1944 and 1947, re-
spectively. In 1950, he received his 
Ph.D, in applied mathematics from 
the University of To ro.n to, Ontario. 

In 1953, Thompson became a Se-
nior Fellow in the Theoretical Physics 
Division of the United Kingdom

Thompson was a member of the

BUDGET: Lt. 
Gov. Davis calls for 
intensive lobbying 
ContInued tram ..... 1 
that middle-class families are accu-
mulating," said Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, 
in reference to the rising cost of a 
UC education. 

"I would like to see this board 
make an effort to freeze fees, to do 
all it can and aggressively lobby in 
Washington and Sacramento, " 
Davis added. "'We should not go 
quietly into that good night." 

total fees for undergraduate resident 
studcnIs would be raised from $4,139 
to $4,409, and total fees for graduate 
students - excluding professional 
schools - would be $4,90S, as com-
pared 10 the $4,635 paid this year. 

Students who lOOk advaJuge of 
the public comment period at 
Thursday's meeting appeared disCour-
aged about the proposed fee increase. 

"'I have become disillusioned with 
decisions made by the board over the 
past few months, and I feel betrayed 
by the 1995 -96 budget proposal," said 
AS. President Naomi Falk. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Over the last five years, student 
fees have risen steadily, going from 
$1,820 in 1990 to $4,139 in 1995. 
This fall quarter marked the first 
time in tbe last decade that student 
fees were not increased.

in student fees for the t 99S-96 aca-
demic year. An agreement between 
the Uc, Gov. Pete Wilson and the 
State Legislature, however, resulted 
in no general fee increase and an 
additional 528.5 million in state funds 
10 be allocated for the UC. 

The board is expected to vote on 
the full '95-96 budget proposal in 
January.

. But other members of the board 
said they were less hopeful that a fee 
increase could be averted. 

"'Our eye has got to be on what is 
imperative to maintaining the qual-
ity of the UC system," said Faculty 
Representative and UC Berkeley 
Professor Arnold Leiman. . 

"You [board members] have 
made students' fee1like they arc not 
a high priority, not a low priority-
not even a priority," Falk added. 

UC Santa Cruz senior Mike 
Caulfield was equally dissatisfied. 

Also, in a unanimous voice-vote 
at Thursday's meeting, the board 
shot down a proposal to amend the 
public comment periods, which cur-
rently take place during the morn-
ing and afternoon sessions. 

Chuck Nauyen/Gu.rd/an 
Exhortation: Lt. Gov. Gray Davis spoke out in opposition to UC 
President Atkinson 's proposed 7.1 percent fee increase. 

"I don't want to see a system that 
falls into disrepair because we flinch 
at these decisions," he added. 

In next year's proposed budget, 

"Right now, our university is 
asking for the bare minimum [from 
the state and the federal govern-
ment), but we need much more than 
the bare minimum," Caulfield said. 
"We should ask for a zero-percent 
fee increase." 

The plan, titled "SP-4, ... which 
was initiated in the wake of more

Throughout the day, approxi-
mately 30 protesters from several UCS 
and a local high school lashed out at 
the regents. Also, a group of hunger 
strikers from UCI a!tended the meet-
ing and pledged to fast until affirma-
tive-action policies are reinstated. 

Twice during the afternoon, re-
gents summoned some 30 UC po-
lice officers to remove the protest-
ers from the auditorium. Following 
the second incident, when protest-
ers were not allowed to re-enter the 
meeting, UC police officers arrested 
a 15-year-old girl and booked heron 
a misdemeanor charge of disrupting 
a public meeting. 

Although no formal announce-
ments were made regarding how the 
board will vote with respect to the 
proposed budget, Falk said she was 
pleased with the regents ' discussion 
over the issue. 

"This is the most debate I've ever 
seen at a regents' meeting," said Falk, 
who was attending her 10th regents 
meeting. "Usually they just rubber 
stamp [proposals). It was refreshing."

23rd overall with a time of 27:17. 
Coming in next for the Tritons 

. was Mike Wallace who ran the 
race in 27:34, which was good 
enough to earn him 28th place 
ovenlI. 

"[Varnell's] performance, mov-
ing up to the number-four man 
was huge. Every time he · knows 
what the stakes are, he comes 
through," Van Arsdale said . 
M[WallaceJ also ran extremely 
well. They have been working each 
other to their maximum abilities." 

Running personal bests this 
week for the Tritons were Francis 
Achie - who made a 25 second 
improvement, coming across the 
line in 28:17 - Steve Plelle 
(28:54) and Mark Vargas (28:27). 

In the women's race, the Triton 
'B' team competed - along with 
an 'A' team member - and re-
ceived a 10th-place finish. Lead-
ing the team was women's Triton 
of the Week, Michaela Monahan, 
who finished with a time of 20:01, 
a personal record by an astound-
ing 68 seconds. 

"[Monahan] just needs to be 
put in the right circumstances. 
She's now our number-three run-
ncr," Van Arsdalesaid of the track 
and field standout. "She has come 
along quite well as a cross-coun-
try runner." 
.. Also reeling in personal bests 
for UCSD were Sarah Wayson 
(22:11) - who enjoyed the 
Pomona course to the tune of a 48-
second improvement on her previ-
ous best performance - Anne 
Voelker, who shaved 2!5 seconds 
to finish in 22:07, Judy Quik 
(22:18) arid Paola Avila (21:26). 

. Coming up next for the Tritons 
is the California Collegiate Ath-
letic Association Championships, 
which will be held in Riverside 
next Saturday. 

It will be UCSD's final warm-
up for the NCAA Division III 
Regionals, to be hosted by the Tri-
tons on Nov. 11. The meet will 
determine the level of UCSD's 
participation in the NCAA Cham-
pionships.

Continued from PIlle 20 
ter dribbling past one player, he ran out of 
room and tried to hit the ball toward the net as 
hard as he could. Catching the Cobber 'keeper 
by surl1ri~, Fong's shot deflected off of 
Anderson's right leg and into the net for a 
Triton 2-0 lead. 

"I was just doing my best to get some-
thing out of the play," Fong said. "I was so 
close to the [out-of-bounds] line when I 
turned [toward the goal). I just hit [the ball] 
as hard as I could, hoping to get something 
out of that." 

That was all the scoring UCSD needed, IS 
freshman Jason Reynoso recorded his sec-
ond-straight shutout. The Tritons control1ed 
the ball and maintained possession through-
out the entire game, and ConCordia got off 
only two shots. 

The closest the Cobbers came to tal1ying a 
score was at the end of the first half, when 
Concordia forward Peter Curry sped toward 
the UCSD goal on a breakaway, which re-
sulted from a Triton defensive miscommuni-
cation. Reynoso was up to the test, however, 
as he aggressively came out of his goal to cut 
down the angle and deflect Curry's blast wide

again. He'll get a good week's training now 
and be ready for Westminster," said Triton 
Head Coach Derek Armstrong, referring to 
his junior defender who played after weeks 
of non-competition with a hamstring in-
jury. 

"Now we 've got two more games," 
Armstrong said. "We have got a week's train-
ing. All the games we have played have been 
tough. We have to go into the playoffs playing 
well."

Staff Writer 
The men's cross-country teams of 

UCSD and Westmont College turned the 
Cal Poly Pomona Bronco Invitational into 
their own personal stomping grounds on 
Saturday moming. And, unfortu-
nately for the Tritons, they were 
narrowly squeezed out of the top 
team spot by the Warriors, settling 
for a second-place overall finish in 
the event. 

UCSD ran its entire 'B' team, as 
well as a few members of the' A' 
team, and came away with indi-
vidual finishes~f second and fourth place. 
However, Westmont did the Tritons one 
better in each 08se, as it captured first and 
third to earn the overall victory. 

TalCing second place at the meet for 
UCSD was J.1. 'Castner, who came across 
the line with a time of25:48, three seconds 
behind the first-place finisher from 

Westmont. 
Coming in fourth for the Tritons was 

Goss Lindsey, who covered the Pomona 
course in a time of 25:55. 

"[Castner] and I controlled the tempo, 
and with one mile left, we were surging," 

Lindsey said. "Then at the half mile 
[mark], the guy from Westmonttook 
off. We waited too long." 

"We were leading at four and a 
half miles, but we haven't been 
working hard on the last 600 to 800 
meters of the race," UCSD Head 
Coach Ted Van Arsdale said. "Now 
we're going .into championship 

training and working on finishing. We'll 
work on putting the icing on the cake. We 
know that we can run those guys down." 

Also racing well for the Tritons this 
week was Steve Varnel1, who took Triton 
of the Week honors on the men's side.

Concordia Nails UCSD 
SWEPT: The UCSD women's volleyball team was dominated by 
Concordia University in three straight sets (15-5, 15-9, 15-3) on Thursday 
By D ... Krd 
Sports Editor • 

Oh, the rollercoaster that is life 
- Well, it seems to have found its 
way onto the courts with the UCSD 

women 's volleyball 
team this season. On 
Tuesday night, the 
Tritons got undoubt-
edly their biggest vic-
tory ofthe year, when 
they trounced arch-
rival California 
Lutheran. Thei'!1por-

·tanceofthe win was made still larger 
by the fact that the Regals had been 
ranked number-one in the Western 
Region. 

On Thursday, however, UCSD 
suffered a setback as demoralizing 
as Tuesday's triumph had been in-
spiring. Concordia Collegeoflrvine 
was the Tritons' opponent, and the 
ladies from up north did unto UCSD 
as the Tritons had done to Cal Lu. A 
straight-set loss (15-5, 15-9, 15-3) 
left the UCSDcrewwonderingwhat 
had happened to the killer instinct 
which was so prevalent against the 
Regals. 

"This [loss) was hard to imagine 
after having played so well [against 
Cal Lu)," Triton Head Coach Doug 
Dannevik said. "This is obviously a 
sign that we're still not in the 
groove." 

The opening game was a run-
away victory for Concordia, and it 

~as threatening to be a repeat per-

forma nee in the second game. The 
Regals had tallied 13 points before 
UCSD had mustered one. 

The Tritons showed their only 
signs of life in that second game by 
crawling back to come within five 
points at 14-9, before they finally 
surrendered the game, 15-9. 

" We did scramble. We 
just didn't execute," 
Dannevik said. "Out of 84 
sets, we had 23 errors." 

The final game was an-
<>.ther easy win for 
Concordia, which waltzed 
outto a 13-0 advantage for 
the second consecutive 
game. The Regals easily 
finished off the belea-
guered Triton squad by a 
15-3 score to take the match 
in straight sets. 

The defeat does not 
bode well for a UCSD team 
wliich has a'rigorous sched-
ule ahead. 

"This is a huge, make-
or-break week coming up 
for us," Dannevik said. " If 
we are any gOOd, we ' ll 
know by the end of it." 

On Wednesday night, 
the Tritons will tackle Di-
vision III nemesis Occiden-
lal at RIMAC arena. That 
game is a must-win for the 

NCAA Championships. 
The Tritons will follow that by 

traveling east to compete in the Trin-
ity (fX) Invitational Over the course 
of the two-day tournament, UCSD 
will be pitted against two top-l Osquads 
and another team in IhC top-IS. 

UCSD spikers if they hope Spiked: Mieke Biesheuvel (foreground) 
10 maintain their seeding in and UCSD were unable to block 
the West Region for Ihe Concordia in a Thursday road game.

SWEENERS 
DAN SWEENEY 

Wacky Wahoo 
Is Not Racist 

. There's no question about it: UCSD Clobbers Cobbers 
Baseball has had its share of 
hurdles to overcome the past 
couple of years. 

From the baseball strike, the 
ongoing saga of Steve Howe 
and the Kingdome's falling roof, 
to owners like George 
Steinbrenner and Marge Schott, 
America's pastime has had to 
overcome more than its share of 
travesties and abrasive person-
alities. Yet, somehow, the 
greatest of games has perse-
vered. That is, until now. 

At a time when baseball 
should be enjoying its defining 
moment, the World Series, the 
game is instead faltering in the 
face of a monumental debacle. 
Namely, Chief Wahoo. 

That's right, Chief Wahoo, 
the Cleveland Indians' wacky 
cartoon icon that decorates 
everything from ball caps to 
underwear, is under fire for 
depicting Native Americans in a 
negative light. 

American Indians have been 
out in droves to protest against 
both the Atlanta Braves and the 
Indians, saying both teams 
portray them in a. negative light.

COB OUT: UCSD's Chris Fong scored two early 
goals to beat the Concordia Cobbers (MN), 2-0 
By Sean Rahlml 
Associate Sports Editor .. 

Feeling a little lackadaisical? Not 
playing with enough spirit? No sweat 
-just come out during your team's 

lineup announce-
ment with a funky 
wig on your head, and 
everything will be 
just fine. 

At least that's 
what junior 
midfielder Jose 

lIIIIIiIilliiiiiiii. ,Ocampo - donning 
his new pony tail- thought his fel-
low Triton soccer teammates . 
needed. 

The stunt worked, as the UCSO 
men's soccer team came out fired-
up against fourth-ranked Concordia 
University (MI), notching a 2-0 vic-
tory and assuring themselves of a 
playoff spot. The second-ranked 
Tritons improved their record to 9-
4-2, dropping the Cobbers to 11-3. 

"Everybody got pumped up for 
the game," Ocampo said. " It was 
just a little gag to get everybody 
relaxed, especially because today 
was an important game. If we would 
have lost, we would not have gotten 
into the playoffs." 

UCSD came out of the gates 
quickly, putting pressure on the 
ConCordia defenders right from the 
sta·rt. The Triton intensity got to the 
Cobbers at the 5:12 mark, when 
Chris Fong capitalized on the 
Concordia goalkeeper's mistake and 
punched a loose ball into the empty 
net for a quick 1-0 lead. 

After a ball got flicked back to-
ward the IS-yard box, the aggres-
sive ' keeper - 6'5" Chad Ander-
son-cameoutofhis 'pen to punch 
the ball away. But he misjudged the 
spin of the kick and ran past it, 
allowing Fong to score his fourth 
tally of the season. 

"I just saw the ball up in the air 
around the penalty spot," Fong said. 
"I just tried to use my body to bring 
it down against the defender. Next 
tbing 1 knew, it just popped out, and 
when I looked around, no one was 
there but the goal." 

Before the junior midfielderfrom 
San Ramon could enjoy his goal, he 
got a chance to increase his team 's 
lead to 2-0 only two minutes later. 
Brian Turner fed him on the right 
side of the field , and Fong took the 
ball down into the IS-yard box. Af-

Now I, for one, am not 
devoid of sympathy for the 
plight of the indigenous 
Americans. I saw Dances With 
Wolves, and like everyone else, 
it tugged at my heart-strings to 
see the displacement of tribes by 
such merciless white settlers. I 
am also well aware that Native 
Americans have had a rough 
time recovering from their 
displacement, and that they 
possess the highest suicide rate 
of any race in the United States.

SALTED: UCSD blasted UC Santa Cruz on Saturday to fortify its position in the upcoming playoffs 

Indeed, they have every right 
to demonstrate. They deserve far 
better. I only ask that they don't 
deface the fine image of Chief 
Wahoo. He's a cartoon charac-
ter, for Heaven's sake. The good 
chief represents Native Ameri-
cans in the same way Elmer . 
Fudd symbolizes poachers. That . 
is to say, he doesn't realJy stand 
for anything. 

This entire scenario delin-
eates all too clearly that political 
correctness can be taken to 
ridiculous extremes. Next, we'll 
hear that the Seattle Seahawks 
must change their logo because 
of the negative way in which the 
team depicts water fowl. 

One thing is certain. If 
American Indians wisb to gain 
public support, there are more 
effective means then attacking 
the most popular of American 
sports - and the most 
recognizeable of baseball icons.
