Regents Discuss Campus Unrest 
Roger Showley 
NewaEdltor 

"We as Regents were not informed. How could 
~e judge the crises when we were out in left field? " 
ro answer Regent Norton Simon's question, The 
Board of Regents Friday heard more than three 

~ours of briefing reports from all chancellors and 
several AS presidents concerned with the recent 
turmoil on the nine UC campuses. 

Little criticism was lodged with the means taken 
>0 far to deal with student concern for con-
temporary problems. "In my many years on this 
Board " said Regent William Roth, "I have never listen~d toa more extraordinarily moving 
presentation." And the rest of the Board seemed 
rf'lieved that matters had not worsened after the 
~ampuses reopened a week ago. 

"What's pulled us together?" asked Simon. "If we 
;1on't stay together, will it take more deaths of 
;tudents to bring another issue before us?" 

UC Irvine Chancellor Daniel Aldrich described a 
situation typical of the campuses. The newspapers, 
he Said, had exaggerated an Academic Senat~ move 
to allow options for students to complete their work 
for the quarter. "I have been kept busy answering 
(that interpretation) all week." 

"We have to face the fact," he continued, "that 
the university is being submerged in a political 
ssue-the university is being inundated by the 
ssues." 

UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Dean McHenry 
described the "low profile" he has adopted, 
allowing the colleges to take the lead in directing 
frustrations toward "constructive solutions"; 

UCSC sent 75 representatives to Washington, D.C., 
last week to meet with Congressmen. 

Gov. Reagan entered the discussion with a 
defense of President Nixon's "peace policy," 
holding that a petition circulating in Santa Cruz 
reflected exactly the terms of peace which the 
United States was offering at the Paris Peace talks. 
"Are the students being made aware that they are 
not alone in the desire for peace?" 

The debate widened into a scene reminiscent of a 
dormitory bull session. Regent Frederick Dutton, 
the resident liberal on the Board, challenged the 
Governor's statement with the allegation that "our 
terms would continue the Thieu-Ky regime and 
prevent intervention by the United Nations." 

The Board. next heard UC Riverside'S Ivan 
Hinderacker express the opinion that "each campus 
faces a crisis. There was no confrontation at UCR 
because of the desire of the whole student body to 
express the deep concern among all the campuses. 
There was a very genuine attempt to try to work 
through the system." 

He went on to describe the students' and faculty 's 
efforts in canvassing the surrounding community, 
holding marches, and visiting the City Council. 
"The police were cheered twice," hi. added with 
obvious pride. 

The only sour note in the three-hour session was 
voiced by Simon in his concern that the chancellors 
had apparently disagreed with President Charles J. 
Hitch that the campuses should be closed up on Gov. 
Reagan's order. 

Hearing Begins on Campus Sit-in 
A preliminary injunction against further sit.ins on 

the UCSD campus was granted Friday afternoon by 
Superior Court Judge William H. Macomber. The 
injunction extends the order issued by the judge 
after the sit-in on April 29-30. 

Meanwhile, the hearing on contempt citations for 
four persons accused of violating the court's order 
by participating in the sit-in of May 4 was continued 
until Wednesday at 10 a.m. 

A crowd of some 75 sympathizers gathered at last 
F'riday's hearing with no incidents. Although the 
hearing was moved to larger chambers in the af-
ternoon, only 27 seats were provided for viewers in 
the morning, leaving the sympathizers crowding 
the hallways where some 15 plainclothesmen stood 
by. Also Judge Macomber refused to allow an out-
side audio system so the crowd outside could hear 
the proceedings. 

Mary Catherine Rose, 25, and Haven Anchen 21, 
two of those cited to show cause why they should not 
be sentenced to five days in jail and fined $500 for 
violating the court's order, were allowed to act as 
their own attorneys. Another defendant, Edward 
Van Valkenburg was represented by attorney 
Charles R. Khoury, Jr.- The fourth defendant, 
Gerald Don Hall , was represented by attorney John 
Porter. Testimony thus far pertains to the 
legality of the service of swnmonses and court 
order on the four defendants. 

Porter argued that the -injunctions were "an 
action aimed at suppressing dissent," and that the 
Regents have not shown "irreparable damage" in 
any form, saying that no educational functions were 
disrupted, only research. 

"Not high-flown basic research, but work in-
volved in the day-to-day prosecution of the war in 
Vietnam," he said. He also pointed out that the 
governor had shut down the university for four 
days, whereas the complaints presented by the 
Regents' lawyer Warren Levin involve less than two 
days. 

Attorney Khoury said the Regents do not have 
"clean hands" because they are involved in 
research connected with an illegal war. 

Miss Anchen , making a statement in her own 
defense, was allowed to discuss how the Vietnam 
war serves the ruling class and how the university is 
essential to the war, although the judge questioned 
the relevance of ner remarks. 

Process server Kent Parker testified he served 
the documents on the four defendants but that none 
of them would accept them. 

Three of the defendants, Miss Rose, Miss Anchen, 
and Van Valkenburg , were additionally cited for 
contempt after last Monday's sit-in and are to ap-
pear before Judge Macomber Friday. Nicholas A. 
Pinnette was also cited after Monday's sit-in. 

MDM March • • n Oceanside l 
More than 7,000 people participated in a "People's Armed Forces 

Day March," organized by the Movement for a Democratic Military, 
in Oceanside last Saturday afternoon. 

According to one participant, the group remained calm and rational 
despite the presence of 450 riot-equipped police and a Marine heli-
copter constantly buzzing overhead. 

After the march was over, more than 5,000 people stayed to hear 
speeches from one of the Chicago Seven, Tom Hayden, plus members 
of the Black Panthers, the Radical Students Society, several Chicano 
groups, and MDM. 

Hayden stated that the march represented a kind of activity that " is 
disfunctional and dangerous. It is no longer useful for people to be 
exercising free speech in the face of encroaching fascism." 

He later declared that "it's a joke to sit down after the march and be 
bombarded by the wild music of a rock band as if it were not a!1 that 
relevant that 500,000 Vietnamese have lain down their1ives in the last 
20 years to wake us up." 

He urged unity and "going back to the campuses to organize," and 
asked that we stop taking "rock, dope ... " as symbols of the struggle 
for peace. 

One of the 24 students who worked Saturday to cl.~a;) up graffiti on 
Urey Hall is seen here swinging from the sixth floor in an attempt to 
scra off one blotch. S~u'.L Its will finish th~l~ .work Saturday. 

Senate Delays Action Again 
Jim Sills 

Staff Writer 
As one of several resolutions passed Saturday, the Academic Senate 

called for an end to security safes for classified documents on campus. 
Also passed were motions "expressing opposition" to classified re-
search on campus, and condemning violence in Cambodia, Kent State, 
and Jackson State. 

Meeting in Humanities-Library Auditorium, the Senate met almost 
continuously from 9:30 to 5 p.m. as a continuation of its emergency 
meeting. The meeting began with a long debate over the motion by 
Prof. Jacob Korevaar which called on the administration to end 
classified research as quickly as possible. 

The arguments centered over what was meant by classified, Prof. 
Joseph Gusfield noting that information from sociological surveys is 
held confidentially. The motion 's sponsors assured that this was not 
what they meant by classified. Nevertheless, the motion was "com-
mitted" to the recently formed Committee on Research supported by 
Military Funding for further study. 

The resqlution by Prof. Michael Parrish was then separated with 
three of its five parts being sent to the same committee. The remain-
ing sections were adopted as written. They reaffirm the faculty's 
opposition to secret research, and request the removal of two security 
safes on campus. 

Prof. Robert Elliot's resolution was also adopted, demanding, 'that 
our country's military involvement in Southeast Asia be terminated." 

an unrelated action at the same meeting, the Senate passed a 
resolution in regard to the Regent 's assumption of control over Angela 
Davis' non-tenure appointment. "The Academic Senate opposes all 
attempts to politicize the university. In light of this principle, we con-
demn iJ1 thp. strongest possible terms, the removal from the President 
(of the University) and the Chancellors, of control of non-tenure ap-
pointments. " 

Particularly disturbed by this action was Prof. William Frazier. 
Frazier indicated that he might resign as acting provost of Third 
College if the Regents interfered in hiring an appropriate staff. 

Still to be considered at the Senate's May 26 meeting are all the 
resolutions commiteed to committee today. Still to be judged are 
motions on letters stolen during the recent sit-ins. 'lnd student disrup-
tions. (see resolution on back page) 

Hayden's message that th war was no mistake was succeeded by 
the messages of the other speakers, some of whom spoke in par-
ticulars. Others spoke in rhetoric. The overall theme of the speeches 
was a call for solidarity of all groups and all individuals. 

The rally broke up about 5 o'clock after the last of the speakers had 
finiShed.

No One (ven Noticed •••• 
Racism rear s its ugly head in many subtle ways. For 

quite some time we have heard that it is the deep-seated 
and less visible "racism" that is more dangerous than 
what is referred to as "bigotry." It is the bigotry of the 
southern ver:sion that is popularly denounced --like 
Maddox passing out ax-handles in his restaurant, but it 
is the racism that exists in nearly every white who is a 
product of this s(}ciety that is rarely recognized and 
therefore harder to root out. 

Dramatic evidence of this came in the wake of national 
student protests this month . The death of four white 
students at Kent State evoked a flood of national protest . 
But how many people realize that two black students 

were killed at Jackson State and six blacks at Augusta , 
Georgia? And amidst all the furor over the tragic ac-
tions of the guardsmen at Kent, how many people 
realize that an autopsy on the six Augusta victims 
revealed that all were shot in the back? At Jackson 
witnesses report that guardsmen opened fire without 
warning. At Jackson State guardsmen fired point blank 
at a student dormitory. More than 140 bullet holes were 
found in the side of the building. 

Yet the reaction to these incidents is noticeable only by 
its absence. No tearful pleas from fathers of the vic-
tlms--in fact, only minimal coverage from the media. 

The press has reported that black participation in 
recent anti-war activities has not been extensive. This 
is not because they do not oppose the war, but because 
they have more immediate concerns in their lives to 
protest. Minority people know that whites are free to 
play the protest game and then quietly slip back into 
the white community, with relative immunity. 
Minorities do not have this privilege. But more im-
portantly, perhaps, it is becom ing clear to them that any 
help they give in protest activites will not be 
reci procated . 

OPINION 
Atomic fuel Endangers Life 
Editor : 

In a recent issue of the TRITON TIMES there was an advertisement 
for Southern California Edison. It told of how Southern California Edi-
son was working to "solve" the pollution problem by powering all its 
new plants with atomic fuel. It tried to give the impression that nu-
clear power was cleaner than fossil fuel power because it produces no 
air pollution in normal operation. This conceals the far more 
dangerous pollution problems inherent in nuclear fission. 

uclear power produces waste fission products which are one 
million times more toxic than any industrial pollutants. The wastes 
which can be filtered out of the effluvia are put in a large tank and 
shipped overland to Washington. Because there is no way to reduce the 
toxicity of nuclear wastes and because of the comparatively long half 
lives of some of the radioactive elements, the only solution possible is 
virtually perpetual containment. By 1995 it is estimated there will be 
approximately two billion gallons of this radioactive waste. This will 
include, among other things, six billion curies of strontium 90, or about 
30 times the amount that would be released in a full nuclear war. 

There are, however, no facilities to pennanently store these wastes. 
Witness a passage from AEC's 1968 funding request to Congress : "A 
total of 149 tanks with about 95 million gallons' capacity have been 
built. Prior to 1964, five tanks have been withdrawn from service 
becau:'le of leaks. Since 1964, one tank has failed and four more have 
devel( p d indications of incipient failure." 

The problems of the low concentrations of radioactive elements left 
in the effluvia are much more difficult to predict, and hence more 
dangerous, because of multiplication effect of the food chaln. In a 
study :lone by Coleman aJld Llbera~p: it was predicted that krypton 85 
alone ~ou1d double the natural background radiation for man. Another 
ecolotical catastrophe similar to the present DDT crisis is not unfore-
seeab.e, However, man might be the species doomed to extinction 

inste~d of the pelican. 

The construction of nuclear power plants is a move to exchange a 
temporary and local pollution problem for a more Wliversal and 
potentially far more dangerous one. The Bureau for Environmental 
Design strongly opposes the construction of nuclear power plants.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Antipollution 
Must Start Here 

Editor: 
I've watched with some 

amusement the activities at 
UCSD concerning pollution. I find 
it very difficult to take any of it 
very seriously. I see a bunch of 
kids crying "Mommy! There's a 
bad dirty world out there. My toy 
is all broke (squall) , fix it! " All 
the while UCSD is burying itself 
in a sea of refuse. A casual walk 
through the campus reveals 
numerous paper and other 
posters stuck up every-
where- fine.· Not so fine i:; the 
fact that many of them have been 
up a month or more ; more still 
are weather worn to tatters and 
said tatters are blowing, along 
with miscellaneous papers, 
garbage, and lust plain junk, all 
over the campus. Aren't the trays 
with half eaten lunches on them 
just lovely ? 

The larger problem concerns a 
few mere fumes, a few beer cans, 
a little heat, a few chemicals, a 
little insecticide. Your sloppiness 
is just an undeveloped version of 
the larger pollution problem. 
Given the resources, I am quite 
sure that yo'u could make all over 
again, perhaps more quickly and 
efficiently, the environmental 
mess that we have with us today. 

You might keep in mind that it 
is much easier to criticize a 
finished product or project than it 
is to foresee the results of a thing 
while still in the process of 
working out its creation. There 
are no devils about who 
knowingly and deliberately set 
out to ruin the environment. 
Unlike picking up campus-type 
garbage , cleaning up the mess in 
the outside environment is a bit 
more complicated than merely 
making up one's mind to do it. 

The incessant whining and 
worrying that is heard coming 
from the campus today doesn't 
change one thing. Perhaps if and 
when you have cleaned up your 
own mess problems of your 
elders or contemporaries will be 
motivated to clean up after 
themselves. 

If you should discover a magic 
potion which will clear up the 
problem quickly and with little 
mess or effort, please advertise 
it .

Chancellor'S recent call for 
communication between 
University and community . 
Before we become overly op-
tomistic, I should like to point out 
through this letter that an active 
body of oppostion exists within 
the community which will do 
whatever possible to undermine 
such efforts. 

My specific experience relates 
to an attempt to obtain use of the 
normally-available facilities at a 
large apartment complex where I 
reside, namely Oakwood. 
Although I went to great lengths 
in explaining the Chancellor's 
program, and that I was willing 
to limit the discussion to just the 
exchange of information rather 
than opinion, and that I would 
assume all responsibility for the 
conduct of the meeting, I was 
totally rebuffed by local 
management as well as the 
parent headquarters of R and B 
Development Corporation in Los 
Angeles. I was even forbidden to 
put notices near people's doors 
inviting them to my own apart-
ment. 

Now, when such situations 
arise, I believe it is most im-
portant to assign the respon-
sibLlity for fostering the oft-
decried polarization between 
University and community with 
the appropriate party.

$60 Tlleft 
Marred Sit·in 

Editor: 
Atthe start of last Wednesday's 

session of the Academic Senate, 
Professor Kohn of the Physics 
Department attempted to un-
dermine the widespread support 
among all sections of the com-
munity for the sit-ins against 
war-related research by 
charging that $60 in cash had 
been taken from an office during 
the sit-in on the third floor of 2A 
and 2A'. Although this charge has 
not been substantiated, those 
partiCipating in the struggle 
against university complicity in 
the war felt his slanderous ac-
cusation deserved immediate 
reply. By unanimous vote last 
Wednesday night they passed the 
following resolutions: 

1. In the unlikely event that a 
theft of $60 did occur during the 
last sit-in, this group 
disassociates itself from that act. 

2. If such a theft did occur and 
the money belonged to a staff 
fund for coffee, etc., this group 
will pledge $60 to repay the loss 
regardless of who was at fault. 

In this manner, the group 
reasserted its commibnent to 
bulld a strong movement against 
war-related r esearch a nd 
repudiated an attempt to split the 
worker-student alliance that 
already has been formed. It 
might be pointed out to Professor 
Kohn and other detractors that 
the Philosophy Deparbnent voted 
84-3 to support the non-violent 
militant tactics used in the sit-
ins.

Blood Donation 
as War Protest 

Editor: 
A mass blood donation to pro-

test the Southeast Asian war has 
been tentatively scheduled for 
Wednesday, May 20. We have had 
considerable difficulty in trying 
to find an organization that will 
come on campus to draw the 
blood, but we have been assured 
by officials at the Naval Hospital 
that once the blood has been 
collected, it will all be trans-
ported to Southeast Asia. Stu-
dents, the faculty and the public 
are urged to donate and protest 
the war. Because there is not a 
critical shortage of blood for 
Southeast Asian war victims who 
are treated by the U.S. Military, 
donors may also protest the war 
by giving blood to a San Diego 
Blood Bank Account for low-
income families. 

We are interested in saving all 
life, and we regard this action as 
a positive form of protest against 
the war. It is also our belief that 
this action will challenge the 
claim of pro-war forces in the 
outside conununity that student 
dissent is negativistic and 
destructive. 

We have invited local media to 
witness these donations.

TRITON TIMES ELECTION SUPPLEMENT 
The TRITON TIMES presents this year 's

tomorrow through Friday, with voting tables 
located in front of the Undergraduate Sciences

16W. Require. Stud.nt-Ori.nt.d AS" 

We require a student~riented 
AS, not an AS-Griented AS. We 
maintain that previous AS bodies 
have been lax in meeting their 
responsibilities to the students 
they supposedly served. They 
neither solicited student needs 
and reactions, nor did they ef-
fectively act as student am-
bassadors to the surrounding 
communities. 

In the past the AS members 
acted as individuals, giving little 
regard to the wishes of the 

students they represented. 
Although probably working in 
good conscience, they could not 
possibly act according to the 
students' desires if they made no 
effort to get student opinion. 
Virtually none of the past AS 
officers spent any time at all 
canvassing for the Ideas of the 
undergrauates. We believe that 
the AS officers, especially the 
President and Vice-President, 
should spend at least ten hours 
weekly talking with students.

More Student Particip.tion, Control 

With the knowledge and ex-
perience gained as participants 
In AS, campus governance, Third 
College, and the outside com-
munity, we are equipped to deal 
with the interactions of students 
and issues, and submit to you the 
follo wing platform. • 

1. We are against any and all 
war research. The academic 
community should pressure those 
with war-related project in-
terests, on and off campus, to 
redirect their efforts to areas of 
critical importance, i.e., 
pollution control, the inner city 
complex, and the population 
problem. 

2. In support of the national 
student strike called by NSA, the 
student should be free to exercise 
his perrogative to continue as 
usual or participate freely in 
activities concerning the anti-
war movement without academic 
penalty. 

3. Implementation of the 
"Report of the Talk Force on 
Student Participation In Campus 
Governance" will strengthen 
student involvement at all levels 
of running the university. There 
Is presently limited student in-
volvement on the academic and 
administrative levels which will 
be pursued and expanded. 

a. AcademJc: Students now 
serve on Academic Senate 
committees representing student 
positions. This will be expanded 
to participation on departmental 

declslon~ak1ng comrnJttees. 

b. Administrative: Students act 
in advisory capacity in areas 
such as the bookstore, parking, 
and registration fee allocation. A 
stronger and more perceptive 
look at the administration could 
be developed by opening ad-
ministrative~mployee postions 
for students, perhaps in the 
Chancellor's office or the various 
deans' offices. 

c. University-wide: There are 
numerous advisory committees 
to president Hitch which will be 
opened up for student par-
ticipation. We will also continue 
to pursue student participation in 
Regents' affairs. Also the newly 
formed ASUC Presidents' 
Council will research and act 
upon common campus issues 
such as the past tuition con-
troversy and the President's 
education fee deferment 
decision. Other problems such as 
media exposure, which have 
usually been negative, will also 
be rectified. 

4. We will seek the repeal or 
circumvention of the forced 
financial Indebtedness ruling 
concerning next year 's new 
educational fee. We feel that this 
mandatory loan is wholly unfair 
to students from lower income 
families by placing an additional 
burden on them that they may not 
be able to bear. This action could 
take the form of a referendum on 
a student fee to support the EOP. 

50 We are committed to Im-
plemelltinl the new AS con-
ltitution. The plan of a council

AS President & Vice-President Note 
The AS President and Vice-

President are the official 
representatives of the 
Associated Students. They 
both share the duties of at-
tending campus committee 
meetings, meeting with oi/-
campus groups , and execut-
ing the various programs 
operated by the AS. 

The president attends 
meetings of the Board 0/ 
Regents each month, where 
he discusses mutual 
problems with other AS presi-
dents on the AS President's 
Council. He also meets with 

Only by directly confronting the 
students can the AS officers know I 
what the students want. 

We also believe that the AS 
President and Vice-President 
should act in public relations 
capacities. They ought to be the 
mediators between the students 
and the community. Most tax-
payers are unaware of the nature 
of the university and of the 
problems the students confront; 
this leads to distrust and a 
decrease in university revenue. 
An extensive program of in-home 
discussions and lectures could 
lessen the gap between UCSD and 
the San Diego community, as 
could talks between the AS of-
ficers and the community 
leaders. We can no longer afford 
to work against the people; we

own government, the ASUCSD, 
must look at itself and 
reevalutate its goals. 

The ASUCSD must be 
responsive to its members at all 
costs. We hope this will occur 
under the new constitution. But 
this can only happen if thpse 
elected initiate rather than 
compromise. The new con-
stitution enables the ASUCSD to 
be on top of a situation when the 
situation arises. We believe there 
is flexibility to encompass 
student need and yet structure so 
that no time is wasted in meeting 
that need. We have a choice as 
students to make or break our 
new system.

The job of Ex ternal A/lairs

The present strike, like the 
anti-tuition battle, demonstrates 
the clear need for establishing (1) 
a structure through which 
students can organize , coor-
dinate, and channel their efforts ; 
and (2) closer ties with students 
around the state to make possible 
greater unity, leadership, and 
concerted action. 

Therefore, the first and most 
urgent task of this com-
missionership is to formulate a 
wo rking communications net-
work between students all over 
California. As a Senator this 
year, and chairman of the Ex-

As students, we are some of the 
most misunderstood people in the 
nation. We have often been 
portrayed by media and 
government officials as bums 
and revolutionaries . As a result 
our views of society are not given 
the respect they deserve. One 
positive solution to this problem 
IS instituting constructive action 
in the community.

the Implementation of an "Inter-
Campus Communications and

However, I would like to in-
corporate the ICCA into a far-
ther-reaching concept : that of a 
student union ; an individual-
member , voluntary union 
existing parallel to the AS, and 
funded by it as a student 
organization. Hopefully , the 
Wlion will grow as it is recognized 
to be the legitimate voice and will 
of the student body, eventually 
assuming the role of the present 
AS. 

Its advantages are obvious: 
ellch student joins to further his 
own interests, since members 
directly participate in policy-
making ; the union can then truly 
represent the consensus of the 
student body. 

Furthermore, a student union, 
unlike the AS, is free of 
regulation by administration or 
Regents and is thus free to follow 
the wishes of its members - be 
that to sue the university to 
contribute to a Black Panther 's 
bail fund. We can make it hap-
pen. 

Montgomery Reeo 
My college, class, and major 

are all superfluous facts in-so-far 
as any relevant personality value 
judgment is concerned. 

I am hesitant in devoting my 
thoughts to my personal cam-
paign at a time when people 
throughout the land are engaged 

establish relationships and 
services between the students of 
UCSD and the San Diego and 
North County communities. 
Specific programs which I will 
institute include : coordinating 
interaction between students and 
local governments; expanding 
the Community Interaction 

Committ~e to reach more people; 
and making the Volunteer Ser-
vices Center a viable 
organization to give students 
expe ience iq service to the 
comtnunity for academic credit. 
I will initiate a camp run by 
st~dents for underprivileged 
chIldren of San Diego . My 
greatest ambition is to involve as 
many students as possible so that 
we can attain a united com-
munity of our own. 

During my year as Revelle 
Senator I have : worked with the 
Community Interaction Com-
mittee ; acted as chairman of the 
reorganization committee which 
led, in part , to the establishment 
of the new constitution ; worked 
with students in determining 
their problems, ideas and 
suggestions ; and endeavored to 
find and carry out solutions to 
these problems.

The purpose of this office is to 
provide an effective means for 
providing interaction and co-
operation between the ASUCSD 
and the larger community. 

After considerable thought , I 
have come to the conclusion that 
three things are particularly 
relevant to that end. First ef-
fective lines of communlc~tion 
must be established between the 
un iver sit y and the various 
organizations of the community 

The whole world Is watching. 
My ideas for improvement at 

UCSD are important enough for 
me to outline them, however, and 
I hope everyone will recognize 
that my motivation isn 't self-
centered. I support presidential 
candidate Brian Ritter ' s 
proposition for an AS-funded 
"free dorm." I support and will 
work for the abolition of in-
voluntary grading. I see the need 
for a children's day-care center 
on campus and will work ·to 
establish one with university 
funding. 

I consider myself a poorly-
informed-active-intellectual-
partially-anarchistic-rational-
civil-and-individual-libertarian. 
So much for brownie points. If 
you have any ideas to share with 
me please call 453-5749 or visit me 
at 452 Galathea Hall . 

Irwin Davidson 
For one to state a strong plat-

form, i.e. I support the war 

such as the San Diego and Del 
Mar City Councils, city police and 
county sheriff's departments, 
radio and television stations and 
the newspapers. 

Second, organizations which 
sponsor interaction between the 
university and the community, 
such as the Volunteer Service 
Center and the ' ACLU, should 
have the support and the 
assistance of the commissioner's 
office. Third, as much effort as 
possible should be expended by 
the commissioner ' s office to 
encourage the community to 
support the ASUCSD and the 
university, rather than oppose it 
and bring pressure to bear on the 
university adminstration. If 
elected, I promise to work to the 
best of my ability to achieve 
these crucial ends. 

Doug Trani 

UCSD cannot make a firm 
commitment to the community 
as long as it refuses to meet the 
needs of the people it serves. The 
first major problem is the lack of 
communication between the 
existing community service I 
organizations . These groups, 
MECHA, BSC, the Community 
Interaction Committee, and the 
Volunteer Service Cente r , 
maintain no regular lines of 
communication. MECHA vice-
chairman Ana Cardenas and I 
agree that representatives from 
every group that interacts with 
the community should form a 
council to gather knowledge and 
make recomendations fo r 
commun ity projects. 

Better communication would 
heip alleviate the second im-
portant problem - the lack of 
funds . Very few people from BSe 
and MECHA realize that money 
is available {rom the Regents 
Matching Fund for Community 
Projects . By working with Sherry 
Compton and Barb Simon as co-

protest, 11 absurd. To do that, in 
my estimation, merely exploits 
the vote. A platform for candi-
dates has historically been a 
concoction of hopes, dreams, and 
outright "lies" to appease the 
people and gain the vote, with 
little or no realization material-
izing. However, in taking this 
attitude, it leaves me in a very 
precarious position . That is, one 
has no way of knowing how he or 
she will benefit by voting for me. 
Therefore I will try to identify the 
things most important. 

1. Act as an effective liaison 
between the Board of Regents 
and the university, enabling us to 
act rather than react. 

2. Create community support 
and more comrnWlication. 

3. Make available all external 
sources of student financial 
assistance. 

4. Create a more viable inter-
campus relationship. 

5. Ensure the external develop-
ment of third college.

end? What's happening at the

Dan Spellens, running . 
unopposed in this race, will be 
responsible , if elected, for

of entertainment and educa-
tional programs for 1970-71. 
He will decide, along with his 
companion committees, how 
to spend an estimated $14,000 
in program funds . 

Will he push dances or lec-
tures? Will he bring big-name 
speakers or noontime bands? 
These are some of the ques-
tions to be dealt with by the 
Program Board Director. 

The priorities will lie with 
this office, and students inter-
ested in getting better week-
end activities going will be 
working with this director to 
spend the AS funds to the best 
advantage.

found out that UCSD is asking for

Proper coordination of com-

could have secured more of this 
money for projects in San Diego.

College Affairs 

The Revelle Committee on 
College Affairs (RCCA) , con-
sist ing of six students, three 
f aculty, and three ad -
ministrators, is up Jor elec-
tion along with the eight AS 
offices . 

Finishing its first year of 
operations, RCCA has come 
to deal actively with prob-
lems at Revelle. Ranging 
f rom educational policy 
changes to Revelle Plaza 
regulations , the responsi -
bilities of RCCA are of great 
importance to Revelle 
students. 

RCCA also works with 
re venue generated from the 
campus ' vending machines. 
This year that amounted to 
some $8,000 for Revelle 's use, 
which funneled into a variety 
of projects . 

Next year RCCA can be 
expected to deal even more 
basically with issues of 
Revelle curriculum and 
en vironment. Want to change 
the Humanities sequence ? 
Want to abolish the language 
requirement? RCCA would be 
the first body Revelle 
students would turn to. 

Student Welfare 
Disgruntled over your book 

bill, your parking permit, or 
your food service? Next fall 
you will need to call on the 
Commissioner of Student 
Welfare to air your gripes. 

Steve Pomeroy is running 
unopposed for this job, and if 
elected, he will have to begin 
immediately to deal with 
long-established feelings 
against the university's Auxi-
l iary Enterprises office , 
which handles those opera-
tions. 

The Student Welfare 
Commissioner will set up 
committees to investigate the 
bookstore, the cafeterias, and 
the parking policies. He will 
act as a "junior" Ralph 
Nader in seeking solutions to 
s tudent complaints, and will 
ne ed a large staff to help him. 

Next year the AS Council 
can be expected to hear often 
from th is commissioner. 

Steve Pomeroy 
Commissioner of Student Welfare 
Revelle 
Junior - Olemistry 

The student welfare com-
missioner is, as the name im-
plies, concerned with the non-
academic aspects of student 
existence . 

A growing school continually 
requires more and better student 
services. Housing is probably one 
of the most critical . Although 
there are existing feedback 
mechan isms for on-campus 
housing, as yet the students have 
little control over what 's 
available off campus. I would 
propose an advisory position to 
the. Del Mar and La Jolla City 
Councils concerned with students 
in the community. Del Mar has 
already indicated their 
willingness to cooperate on this 
Idea. 

The transportation of students 
to and from campus is of growing 
concern. I support the subsidizing 
by the AS of San Diego Transit 
Bus tokens and would look for 
ways to extend transportation 
services into North County. 

.. 

RCCA will also be respon-
sible for sending representa-
tives to campus committees 
and the AS Counci l. The 
college has a whole hierarchy 
analogous to the campus 
system of committees. RCCA 
is the place where students

Student membership on ad-
ministrative committees is a 
vital force in the university. It 
would be one of the first jobs of 
the new commissioner to 
spearhead a drive to find in-
terested and informed students to 
serve on these committees. In 
them is vested much of the power 
to run this campus and they 
cannot be left devoid of student 
representation and ideas as they 
sometimes are. 

The student as a consumer has 
been neglected until just 
recently. I support the People's 
Food Co~p , and would use the 
powers of the office to aid them in 
their growth and expansion into 
other areas of consumer goods. 
The discount record store which 
has been in the lower planning 
stages this year will ~ given 
more active consideration. If 
enterprises such as these can be 
established and given the support 
of the UCSD community, their 
expansion will take place 
naturally. 

Finally, in light of the in-
creased student fees, I propose to 
work with the council for more 
financial aid to students.

all students, to channel inquiries 
and suggestions to the proper 
people . Through polls, 
questionnaires, and the ca n-
vassing of the campus, the 
students would have more oc-
casions to voice their opinions. 

I would like to see the public 
release of the budgets of all 
Revelle services, including the 
RCCA, the Inter-Hall Council , the 
cafeteria, the Sundry Store, and 
the Bookstore, to allow the 
students to evaluate for them-
selves the handling of student

deemed more important by the 
students. I sincerely hope you 
will support me in m y efforts to

Barbie Butler 

Director of Public Relations 
Sophomore - Biology 

Recent events on this campus 
have shown dramatically the 
need for prompt and accurate 
distribution of information 
concerning the action:; and 
poSitions of the Associ ated 
Student Body. 

As director of public relations 
for ASUCSD it would be my task 
to keep students informed of the 
proceedings and decisions made 
by their representative govern-
ment. This I feel could best be 
accomplished through use of the 
campus media - the TRITON 
TIMES and KSDT radio . Sup-
plementing this influx of in-
formation would be occasional 
informal discussions making the 
elected officers availabl'e for 
questions and dialogue with the 
students they represent. 

In addition , as public relations 
director, I would be responsible 
for relations with the media of the 
outside community - especially 
the press. Although this task will 
probably prove the most difficult, 
I hope that it can at least in part 
be accomplished by sending out 
accurate press releases of the 
occurances on campus (when 
such releases become necessary) 
and by presenting unam-
biguously the position held by the 
Associated Student Government. 

This latter point, I feel, is of the 
utmost importance since it is the 
student officers that are the of-
fi cial repr esentatives of the 
student body. Any and all of their 
actions r efl ect directly upon the 
students both collectively and 
individually. It is therefore the 
right and to a m uch greate 
extent should be the desire of all 
students to be informed about 
what their representatives are 
doing. 

I welcome the chalienge of 
establishing and strengthening 
the rapport between the students 
and their representative 
government and between that 
government and the commun ity. 
Constructive advances in the e 
ar eas can only help to unify the 
campus and make the AS a true 
representative of the students on 
campus. 

Revelle 
Sophomore - Biology 

Conversations and dialogues 
between the students, faculty and 
staff have begun with increasing 
frequency in our time of crisis. 
The Revelle Committee on 
College Affairs has funds within 
its budget that are expressly for 
the purpose of promoting such 
discussions. 

The RCCA has negotiated for 
fire construction workers' offices 
presently located on the Mat-
thews campus. They are to be 
moved to the Revelle campus for 
conversion into a student center 
complex. Open meetings have 
been held concerning the pur-
poses and functions of these 
buildings. Any additionai 
suggestions should be sent to the 
Revelle Provost Office. Possible 
uses run from a child care center, 
music practice room, darkroom, 
to a craft center or free dorm . All 
suggestions are pre enUy under 
investigation. 

With a year 's experience on 
RCCA, my object in running for 
re-election is to promote open 
communication between students 
and faculty, but just as im-
portantly, between the Revelle 
community and the government. 
Also , as a member of the com-
mittee about the new complex, I 
shall be working to see that it 
finds satisfactory use in as many 
ways for as many people as 
possible.

The basis for my campaign for 
re-election is the fact that I have 
served on the CCA this past year 
and feel that the exper ience I 
have gained is a strong asset . 
This past year has been one of 
adjustment and organization for 
the CCA, and I have served as 
chairman on the sub-committee 
for procedures and rules by 
which the CCA will operate in the 
future . I have also been chairman 
of the sub-committee developing 
plans and uses for the proposed

his is the most crucial for the 
stude nts as a whole. 

Th e Aca demic Aflairs 
Commissioner is responsible 
for k eeping track of changes 
in curriculu m and policy, and 
relating them back to the ASC 
at its week ly meetings. He 
will have to set up com· 
mittees to study po sible 
changes in courses and 
departments . No doubt he 
would be the person respon-
sible for publishing a " faCUlty 
guide" lor students. 

The meetings of the Aca-
demic Senate also comes 
under the purview of this 
commission r . He would 
necessarily have to work 
closely with the senate 
chairman, who is now history 
professor Gabriel Jackson .

1. I will see to It that student 

But as 
well as the AS, needs to extend 
the scope of its communication 
with the st udent body and 
faculty; this requires that an 
experienced member of the CCA 
help to do this. My experience on 
the Judicial Board, as weil as the 
CCA, enables me to have 
knowledge of an a feeling for the 
inter-relation between the other 
student government committees 
on campus and the CCA. This is 
the first step to better 
organization and coordination 
between the CCA, the AS, and the 
college community in general.

I feel that it is the role and 
responsibility of the Revelle 
College government to provide 
active leadership as well as to 
allocate funds . Every activity 
which takes place on Revelle 
Plaza concerns the college by 
nature of its location . The 
university is related to the out-
side community in innumerable 
ways, and cannot be isolated 
either intellectually or actively 
from San Diego, the state of 
California, or the nation. It is my 
intention to maintain constant 
questioning of these relationships 
and of the purposes of Revelle 
College. 

Revelle should become a 
dynamic community which 
implies much improved faculty-
student interaction. I propose 
opportunities for faculty-student 
informal discussion throughout 
the year , and mutual in-
volvement on common issues. 

I propose the organization of a

members on Academic Senate 
and other committees attend the 
meetings regularly . If they 
perform poorly I will recommend 
their replacement by the AS 
council . 

2. I will support desired 
change through persuasion, not 
intimidation or force. 

3. I will have questionnaires put 
before the students to learn their 
opinions on curriculum, grading, 
and seiection of a new chancellor. 

4. AS expenditures will be 
printed, to the penny, in the 
TRITO I TIMES. 

Students have important 
representation in one of the 
major power centers on this 
campus : the Academic Senate . 
CPE, mhority students, Third 
College, and the banning of 
classified research have shown 
that students can work peacefuliy

I support efforts to locate

have been working on plans for a

support its activities which will 
begin in the fall to facilitate

see the renovation of existing

new buildings such as proposed 
by the present RCCA to provide

Because of this personal ·

qualified to represent Revelle 
students as a member of RCCA. 
In the absence of any prevalent 
student opinion. I will use my own 
judgment and wishes when

proposals before the RCCA . 
When there exists significant 
controversy ' over a measure. I 
will propose putting the measure 
to the students of Revelle. F or

Revelle student center to a

I do no stress the recurring 
topic of communication between 
RCCA and the students in this 
platfonn because it is a stale one. 
There is li ttle that a student 
government official can .do to 
stimulate such communication . I 
will talk to , and listen to , any 
student who contacts me 
(Galathea 306 ; 453-3863 ). 

This is my platfonn. It is an 
honest and candid one. And that 
is what I count upon to win the 
support of the students of Revelle 
College.

composed of commisslonershlps 
and college representatives will 
make ASUCSD a responsive and 
useful organization. The purpose 
of each commission Is to initiate 
and carry out programs to meet 
the needs of the students. We will 
stimulate these initiative efforts 
in areas such as the following : 

a . A free legal counseling 
service for students. This will 
consist of a local lawyer retained 
for a defmite number of hours 
each week to advise students on 
legal matters. 

b. Expansion of AS enterprises 
and facilities and plans for the 
Cluster I student center . For 
example. the Coffee Hut will be 
inlarged to accomodate people 
inside for dinner and en-
tertainment in warmth and 
comfort without disturbing the 
atmosphere of the present 
arrangement. 

c. Continued AS support for 
student initiated cultural and 
beneficial activities. i.e .• funding 
of the Anomaly Factory, Food 
Co-<>p, and preschool. 

d. Community Interaction and 
local government. The AS will 
support activities such as the 
people-to-people program and a 
commitment to making com-
munities in which students live 
responsive to their needs. 

e. Campus Programming. This 
year 's experience shows that 
having a large number of big 
nam e ro ck concerts is im-
possible. We wish to present a 
large number of cultural and 
entertainment events that do not 
require financial support of the 
outside public to insure their 
success. This will include movies 
("kinetic art" - student -
fi lms . teatures. and others), 
Coffee Hut entertainment and 
food (bands, folk, flicks , 10 cent 
hot dogs, steak fry, ton of 
wa termelon. et c. ) . and a 
diversified program of social and 
cultural events suited to the 
tastes of our students (free 
concerts , plaza dances. bonfires. 
arts. and lectures ). 

f. Expansion and improvement 
of student servles . This means 
effective student participation in 

continued from page 3 
Our present student govern-

ment is for the large part inef-
fective: it neither represents the 
wishes of a small , radi cal 
minority nor those of the 
majority. Either this fonn of 
government must be r endered 
~ore effective or it should be 
demolished, tenninated . In order 
to make it more effective. I 
propose that : 

a . A referendum is in order to 
decide whether there should be a 
government or not. 

b. A referendum is in order to 
detennine whether or not to 
continue present plans to build a 
student center . 

c. Students should not be forced: 
to pay mandatory fees (such as 
that for a s tudent center ) without 
referendum elections. 

Our present system fails to 
meet the needs of the students . 
Referendum is one answer to 
bringing the voice of the students 
into the government. If these and 
other methods fail , then the 
government must be dissolved 
and the students turn to private 
sources for con solidat ion of 
power . 

As to revolUtion, sit-ins and 
other " non-violent " measures 
are for the most part useless. 
They merely inflame others and 
placate students, give students a 
fal se sense of accomplishment to

that once quarterly each student 
should receive by mail a com-
plete listing of AS financial 
transactions. Only if the students 
know how their money is spent 
can they present their reactions 
to the AS Council. 

The Creative Arts Comples 
begun by Revelle College should 
be expanded and completed so 
that student use can begin In the 
F.all. This complex could include 
a music practice room , a lounge 
for commuter students, a sewing 
center. a painting and pottery 
studio. and a photographic 
darkroom. Additional facilities 
could be added using AS funds. 
This center would serve as the 
temporary student center until 
the permanent facilities are 
completed in a few years. 

A well-planned student garden 
ought to be constructed on or 
near the Muir College campus; 
this can be done at relatively 
little cost. Plants grown there 
could be transplanted elsewhere 
on campus as part of a student 
landscaping project . ' 

KSDT, the university radio 
station. cannot be received in 
many areas of the campus ; this 
problem should be immediately 
alleviated. The station should 
then set aside about one hour 
each evening for a series of 
debates and talk shows involving 
students, faculty. and guests 
from neighboring cities. 

Our basic goal is to transform 
the AS Council into a body which 
actively seeks to enlist student 
aid and opinions. Only in this 
manner can the Council truly 
represent the undergraduates of 
UCSD. The AS Council should 
serve the student: it should be his 
slave, not his master.

but it doesn 't mean anything 
right now. Why aren't you doing 
something constructive?" And I 
agreed. and I went out and did 
something. 

But what are the other can-
didates going to do at the next 
crisis? We need dedication , not 
politicians. We need mobility to 
fight the war . fight racism, fight 
the oppression of poor people . 

I reaffinn that as AS president 
I would go beyond the powers of 
that office for our struggle . I will 
go as far as the students support 
me to institute passl fail grading. 
construct a free dorm, end the 
prosecution of students involved 
In our struggle. declare a two 
week recess just before the 
elections in November to get 
involved in electing or de-electing 
officials - particularly Rcmald 
Reagan - and finance our end of 
every major crisis with AS funds . 

I am a write-in candidate. The 
AS refused to put me on the 
ballot. Take this newspaper to the 
polls and write in " Brian Ritter" 
for President. Power to the 
People. 

Violence would either end in a 
police state or in real , rapid 
change. A vote for me is a vote 
for one who prefers the fonner 
method, but, if necessary. would 
not hesitate to employ the latter .

Never trust anyone over thirty? How about someone over one 
hundred thirty? If you say forget it. you may miss something. Henrik 
Ibsen's "An Enemy of the People." while written in 1882, is as contem-
porary as today 's ec<Katastrophe. The play concerns a doctor who 
discovers that the water supply of a health resort is polluted. The 
townsmen, bourgeois and proletariat alike. fear for their economic 
interests and attempt to silence the doctor , applying various pressures 
to him and his some-time allies. 

Oliver Malcolmson. In one of the best Globe acting jobs of the 
season. was very forceful as Dr . Stockman. bringing out the man 's 
character in full depth : strong, with idealistic integrity. As a foil to the 
doctor was his brother the mayor who was determined to protect the 
citizen's financial interests. Mayor Stockman was played by Charles 
Knowlton, who made a strong showing to bring out the baser power of 
an opposite sort of character. He was the very model of a modem 
smug establishmentarian . Knowlton and Malcolmson created power-
ful drama between them. personifying the confllct between principles. 

The supporting cast was at least adequate . Dan McLaughlin, a fine 
character actor , was excellent support as the moderate Mr. Aslaksen 
who, caught in the middle . cops out . Ruth Gostin giws a sensitive 
portrayal as the wife subject to family pressures. Guest director ' 
Minerva MarquiS, working with the Arthur Miller adaptation. did a 
good job in presenting an integrated dramatic production forceful In 
this modem age. At a number of points there was spontaneous ap-
plause. which Is something rarely heard. 

Dr. Stockman is finally deserted by his liberal and moderate allies , 
and stands alone. His great insight is that the majority-silent or 
noisy-are always wrong. It's people of vision who see the truth. When 
the majority finally catches up, the man of vision is still ahead. seeing 
a new truth. Not only is truth precious. it is dangerous and there are 
those who would try to destroy it as well as those who would try to 
preserve it. Ibsen has seen some truths which still elude many of us. 
Pollution, now, isn 't something that just the fat cats have an interest 
in-<:ontrary to SOS type B.S.; rather , pollUtion is something for which 
we all have a responsibility. As Pogo says, "we have met the enemy 
and they Is us. , . How will we react to the truth? 

Exit The King 
Larry Johnson 

Arts Writer 

The Mariachis were playing romantic Mexican corn in the back-
ground as we dined on Chilis Relleno at La Casa Blanca. With all the 
Mexican trimmings and washed down with red wine, it was a most 
pleasant and relaxed meal under the dumbyia tree in the patio. It was 
sunset , with the oak trees and towering eucalyptus of Old Town Plaza 
m aking a lovely background through which a light spring breeze blew. 

After a leisurely meal we strolled over to the patio of Manuel's for a 
round of margaritas. The change of patios brought us to the historic 
Casa de Pedrorena where California history was made. A cafe as well 
as an historical monument, the isolated garden patio makes an ideal 
spot for an after-<iinner or pre-theater drink. In fact. the heady at-
m osphere of the lush secluded garden under the old adobe walls 
seduced us into having another round of drinks. 

. 

Full of spring and margaritas, we were in a great mood for an eve-
ning of theater. It was an amble of about a block to the Mission Play-
house for lonesco's " Exit the King." In the midst of historic Old San 
Diego. Edythe Pirazzini presents a cross section of the modem and 
off-beat. doing plays that someone should do, but that most don't have 
the nerve to put on. The Mission Playhouse should be better known in 
the academic community. " Exit the King" treats the question of death 
and how men should live their lives. recognizing their mortality. The 
dying king, played by Martin Gerrish, is Everyman , struggling with 
his fate. Everyman and Everyinstitution. he struggles with changing 
reality and the passage of time. It would remind some of the last days 
of Lyndon Johnson. The thought line seems to be existentialism, with a 
dash of Buddhism. Gerrish did a convincing job of representing the old 
king in various stages of decay, struggling against necessity. Mimette 
Ehrenfreund was a standout as Queen Marguerite, the acid matri-
arch. A principle rather than a person , the Queen is the personification 
of the necessity which orders all being. Bill Gaylord, the Playhouse 
veteran, was very effective as the coaly punctilious doctor. William 
Garleb as the guard, about all that was left of the king's deteriorating 
kingdom, conveyed well the general feeling of unease. Darlene Gould 
was not fully effective as the loyal but frivolous Queen Marie. She 
should have been a foil to Queen Marguerite, but the characterization 
dido't come over. The lone remaining maid was jauntily played ·by Pat 
Curtis , a vigorous and talented actress . 

In an age of disease , when men, nations, and institutions all seem 
under strain. there is food for thought In this modem play; Fridays 
and Saturdays at the Mission Playhouse .

Review 
It's been a good year for sym-

phony in San Diego. The season 
ended recently with Beethoven 's 
First- this anniver sary yea r 
(200th of Ludwig's birth) is 
certainly the time to get your fill 
of Beethoven- Brahms ' Fourth. 
and a poetry reading . Minna Coe, 
a modem Southern California 
poetess. told how she ha d come to 
write the poem. then r ead it . 
After that , Kiyo Tashima, a 
lovely American contralto, sang 
the poem to symphonic music 
specially written fo r t he poetr y 
by Richard RaJf. While the Ralf 
m usic had nowhere near the 
depth of the Brahms and Beet-
hoven. it was colorful and the 
singer gave it good interpretive 
feeling. The recitation would 
have been improved if t1:le 
duplication between the reading 
and the singing had been elimi-
nated, but it was an interesting 
and va lua bl e expe r iment in 
modern impressionistic poetry . 
In this final concert of the year. 
the orchestra was in good 
technical fonn , though not a s 
spirited as they have been on 
occasion. 

It 's been a fine season with an 
orchestr a reaching maturity . 
getting progressively finer. with 
a program of excellent guest 
artists. After a five month lay-<>ff 
the symphony will be back when 
school starts with another fine 
program with something for 
everyone (including us). Soprano 
Roberta Peters will lead off the 
program of opera excerpts, and 
pianist Van Cliburn will appear 
later, to name a couple. It's grea t 
to have great music here in San 
Diego. 

films on Campus

This week the AS Friday night 

movie is French director Jean-
Luc Go dard 's " Contempt" 
(1964" a film which greatly 
disappointed most cr itics and 
presents a severe loyalty test to 
even very devoted Godard .fans. 
The screenplay, based on a novel 
by Alberto Moravia. is also by 
Godard and was almost certainly 
m ade up as it went along. 

Its story deals with a French 
couple in Rome. He is a screen-
writer (Michel Piccoli ) hired to 
write a film version of the "Ody-
ssey" for a brutal American 
producer (Jack Palance); the 
producer wants the wife (Brigitte 
Bardot); she develops contempt 
for the husband because she has 
the impression that he doesn 't 
object to her hwnoring his boss . 
It is a drama of marital disinte-
gration and also features director 
Fritz Lang as himself. "New 
Yorker" in 1964 stated , "Miss 
Bardot has never been so naked 
or so beautiful," but goes on to 
declare that the film leaves one 
" numb with bore dom " and 
avoids big scenes of any kind in 
favor of a series of broken-<>ff 
conversations and a number of 
" in " Jokes with which Godard 
" persists in di sfig uring his 
work." 

" Time" describes th e film as 
" doodling disguised as art," and 
The NEW YORK TIMES stated 
that though Godard is attempting 
to make the film communicate a 
sense of alienation of individuals 
in a complex modern world. the 
tempo is irritating and boring 
and it Is not at all clear why the 
wife Is so contemptuous of her 
husband. 

Possibilities 
Continuing on ca mpus this week 

are two drama pr oductions. The 
Experimental Theater finishes out 
its extended run witbperfor m-
this Fr iday and Saturday night.
