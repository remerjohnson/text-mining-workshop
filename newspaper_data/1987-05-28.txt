Problems plague 
P.E. Deparbnent 
By GUSTAVO SANTOYO, and CHARLES TABESH 

This has been one of the most 
successful years in the history of 
UCSD athletics. Enrollment in 
physical education and recreation 
c\asses is higher than ever, and 
intercollegiate athletic programs 
have had great national success. 

Yet, beneath the surface, waves 
or discontent have shaken the 
foundation of the f!lighty UCSD 
athletic programs. Some staff 
members within Campus 
Recreation are dissatisfied with the 
way their unit is being managed, 
and coaches do not feel that they 
are adequately compensated. As a 
result, morale within the 
Department of Physical Education 
is perhaps at its lowest point ever. 

"Right now, there's a real 
negative undercurrent going 
through the whole department; 
rec. hates P.E., P.E. hates rec., and 
so forth,~ said women's volleyball 
Coach Doug Dannevik, who has 

brought three national champion-
ships to UCSD. 

Originally, here were no 
Intercollegiate Athletics (lA) or 
Recreation divisions, rather, all 
activities were run by P.E. faculty 
members. Eventually, as the 
campus grew, a need for the two 
units developed. They were set up 
to operate, however, within the 
domain of the P.E. Department. 

Under the current structure, IA 
and Campus Recreation are both 
~verned by the P.E. Department 
- an arrangement over which 
many have expressed concern. "I 
think that there is a morale 
problem," said Joseph Watson, 
vice chancellor of undergraduate 
affairs. "There is a feeling of 
unfairness with this policy." 

In a management review report 
that was commissioned by 
Chancellor Atkinson, this situation 
was C! primary concern. "We are

concerned that a vital and 
motivated Recreational Sports 
[Campus Recreation) Unit is 
denied normal career develop-
ment, respect and opportunity by 
an antiquated policy of faculty 
member-only advancement," reads 
the Chancellor's Management 
Review Report of August, 1986. 

This independeQt report was 
requested by Atkinson to study the 
situation within the P .E . 
Department, and recommend 

possible changes. 
When P. E . Department 

personnel were questioned about 
the review report, they declined to 
comment, ci ting . a memo . 
circulated by P.E. ch"ir Howard 
Hunt prohibiting them from 
discussing it. "We were given a 
memo that we were not to talk to 
anybody about the management 
review, and that. we were to refer all 
questions to Howard Hunt," said 
an anonymous source. 

"Essentially, the charge of the 
committee is to look at the entire 
department and see where there 
are spots that can be improved, 
and look at representation for all 
employees, some who perhaps in 
the past haven't been represented 
as well as they should be: said 
Hunt. 

UCSD checks ou~ library 
In response to the report, 

Watson has set up an ad hoc 
committee to study the problem 
and recommend possible 
solutions . This committee , 
comprised of two members from 
each program unit and .headed by 
Hunt, recently began holding 
meetings. 

Many of the P.E. Department's 
underlying problems are being 
illustrated by the current 
difficulties plaguing the recreation 
division. The director of campus 
recreation, Diana Chadwell, has 
been the object of criticism from 
many of her subordinates.

or are rumored to have contacted 
the Foundation about getting the 
Reagan libraty, which will also 
include a Reagan museum and a 
Center for Public Affairs and 
Policy Studies. 

The Irvine Company owns 
most of Irvine, includmg land 
adjacent to UC Irvine and has 
reportedly offered to donate any 
one of four plots of land to the 
foundation for consideration as 
library sites. Two of these parcels 
abut UCI property, which was the 
only reason the univerSIty was 
consulted by the Foundation, 
according Linda Granell, the 
school's Director of Public 
Information. 

"There are definitely ongoing 
talks [between the Irvine 
Company and the Reagan 
Foundation]," said Judy Frutig, 
Corporate Communications 
Manager for the Irvine Company, 
adding that while it was the . 
foundation who approached the 
company, the company was 
indeed interested in providing 
the land necessary for the library. 

UC Riverside has also 
announced that it is planmng to 
lure the Reagan library to its 
campus. Riverside's bid contains 
a clause that would ensure their 
researchers adequate ac e s to 
the presidential archives.

Pro-choicers and 
right-to-lifers both 
denounce abortion bill 
By].W. AKERS-SASSAMAN, Capttol Corre pondent 

SACRAME TO, UC Wire - Pro-
choice supporters and right-to-live 
backers joined forces yesterday to 
denounce an Assembly bill that 
would limit a minor's right to an 
abortion without her parents' 
consent. 

During a hearing of the 
Assembly judiciary Subcommittee 
on the Administration of Justice, 
Assemblymember Phil Isenberg 
said his Assembly Bill 67 was a 
"solid compromise" between 
diametrically opposed pro-chOice 
supporters and their right-to-life 
opponents. 

Despite this, the bill was almost 
universally opposed by audience 
members. 

To the obvious disappointment 
of the audience which filled the 
subcommittee's hearing room and 
overflowed into the outside 
hallway, subcommittee member 
did not take action on the bill , but 
forwarded it to the Assembly 
Judiciary Committee without 

recommendation . The committee 
was heduled to consider the 
measure late yesterday afternoon. 

AB 67 would prevent a woman 
under the age of 18 from gettling 
an abortlon unle s she had the 
consent of her parents orguardian, 
or the approval of an offiCIal of the 
county child welfare office. 

The offici,!l could only approve 
the abortion after holding a 
hearing to determine if the minor 
IS "suffiCiently mature and 
suffiCiently well-informed to make 
the decision on her own ." If the 
minor is deemed not sufficiently 
mature or well-informed, the 
hearing officer would then 
consider whether the abortion 
"would be in the best interest of the 
minor," the bill states. 

The bill also makes the parent 
of the mother of the chUd, and of 
the father of the child if paternity is 
proven, finanCially liable for child' 
care and upbringing.

Med Center liver 
transplant patient dies 

Less than eight weeks after 
undergomg liver tran splant surgery at 
the UCSD Medical Ce nter, the only 

~UIVIVll1g pi\tlent to have recclved a It\'Cr 
through the hospital', nell' ltver 
tmnspl.lIlt program dIed unday 

The death of 42 year 91d Ray 
Shelbourne of Escondido came Just five 
weeks after the first .lnd only other 
patient In the program died due to her 
body' reJectlon of the donated organ . 

A hospital officia l said Shelborne died 
of hver failure, but was unsure of what 
exactly caused his liver to fall. 

Shelbourne, who had been suffering 
from chronic acuve hepatitis , undelwent 
the 14· hour transplant surgery April l. 
He remained at the hospital until his 
death. 

Despite the rwo deaths, hospital 
officials are confident of the program 
and plan to perform more transplants 10 
the future . 

Liver transplants, among the most 
difficulty of all surgical procedures, have 
an overall one-year survival rate of 60 
percent to 80 percent. FollOWing the 
operation, patients must continue to 
take anti -rejection drugs for the 
remainder of their lives. 

UCSD's hver transplant program is 
the only one In San Diego, and one of' 
the three in the state. UCLA and UC 
Davis have the other rwo programs. 

. The openltive and postoperative costs 
of the first transplant patient which the 
hospital paid, was $160,000 

Campus experiences 
rash of computer thefts 

More than $50,000 worth of 
computers and printers, mostly Apple 
and Macintosh brands, have been stolen 
from UCSD since the middle of March, 
lohn Anderson, director of communi ty 
safety, sai~ recently. 

The thefts have ocurred at night and, 
m most instances, no force was used to 
enter the bUIldings, he added. 

Some of the computers and printers 
were secured to tables by padlocks and 
cable systems which were easily cut. 
Several computers were not secured at 
all. 

Anderson recommends that door 
locks be rekcyed periodically and that 
computers and primers be anatched by 
anchor pads, semi-permanent 
attachments to desks that secure office 
equipment firmly, Experience shows 
that equipment secured by anc hor pads 
I seldom stolen, Anderson said .

4 ThurseJav, May 28, 1987 

Political censorship is an unwritten rule at UCSD 
,A few weeks ago, during a job-opportunity "forum" at the career center, a 

few recruiting agents [or the FBI walked into an obviously conflictial 
situation with some of UCSD's most perseverent political activists. As it so 
happened, though , the scuffle that errupted between the FBI recruiter who 
apparently has a strong aversion to being photographed, (so strong in fact 
that she saw it as part of her job to attempt to wrench a camera off a 
protestor's neck), and Third College Resident Advisor Kristen Crabtree was 
not just another run-of-the -mill sparring match between leftist activists and 
controversial government agencies, but shed some new light on what has 
become an unwritten policy of selective censorship on University of 
California campuses. 

It's interesting that just one week prior to the career center scuffle, the 
University Police escorted a group of right-wing protestors through Peterson 
Hall in order to ensure that they safely vented their opinions of Angela Davis' 
views; their idea of "proper protest" was to drown out the sound of Ms. Davis' 
voice that was coming over a P.A system, and then to promptly unplug the 
video screen. The police, by the way, have said that it was the audience who 
provoked the right-wing group into disrupting the lecture. That is rather 
odd, considering that the police stood casually watching a few burly lads in 
Coors caps try to physically force their way into an already filled auditorium. 
The police had been informed just minutes before that there was barely 
enough room left in the overflow hall for the protestors. However, the police 
ignored the advice of the securi ty guards at the event, and decided to wai t up 
until the moment a shOving match ensued between the security guards and 
the protestors before they de termined that it was in the best inte rest of the 
University to aVOId a not during the event. Of course conservati ves possess a 
constitutionally sanctioned right to protest whatever they believe is wrong, 
or 'right: and it is the duty of the campus police to insure that thei r rights of 
free speech are preserved. However, it will be a cold day in El Centro before 
UCSD-PD would go to similar length to protect the Left in the same manner. 

The question raised by these incidents IS a serious one: Does the 
University and its police force selectively enforce or ignore the constitutional 
rights of people on the basis of thei r poli tical beliefs in order to reinforce 
those of its leaders? Has the University of California institutionalized 
repreSSive strategies with respect to left-wing political activists and 
intellectuals? 

It has been alleged by high-placed sources that the Provost offi ces of the 
different colleges maintain 'blackl ists' of political undesirables in order to 
prevent them from re-enrolling at a UC school after they are dismissed on 
wha tever technicality was handy at the time. It is now public knowledge that 
former Third College Dean Beverly Varga was terminated after publicly 
disagreeing with the University'S handling of the Russel Andalcio case. It is 
not a strange coincidence that a flagrantly conservative administration just 
happe ns to oversee such events and takes action only to cover them up, not 
rectify them. 

A somewhat less obvious contributor to this problem is the structure of 
UCSD's upper administration. This shadowy corridor of power structure is 
constructed in such a way that it safely shields its members fro m ouster fro m 
below. AppOinted only by their fraternal higher-ups. the Regents, with no 
Input whatsoever from the staff or student body, the administranve system of 
governance would please the Kremlin. aturally the adm inistrators are 
politically screened so that they view in the 'proper' way the University's 
massive involvement in military research and the Regents' various corporate 
interests. 

Equally important as its political interests are the University'S economic 
poliCies. In fact , the UC has been known to regularly set aside political 
questions when they conflict with ItS monetary interests (see the Regents'

attempt to "depoliticize" UC's former investment in South Africa, the Police 
department's conSidering of rape details as privileged information because 
they wish to avoid a reputation similar to that of San Diego State University, 
and the University'S opposition to the San Diego Trolley route which was 
scheduled to run near the campus, beca l..1se the close proximity to the school 
and the free parking that is proVided for trolley customers throughout the 
city would eat into the profits presently generated by parking permits and 
tickets). Priority one is income, priority two is politics, most especially when 
those who are asking the political questions are without a lot of money. 

What has been done to combat this? A few very active people have taken it 
upon themselves to try to provide at least a small counterforce to the 
omnipotent administrative hierarchy. Many of the names are familiar ones, 
due mainly to the coverage they receive when arrested at events that concern 
their decidedly leftist political views, such as their opposition to U.S. 
intervention in Central America, UC investment in South Africa, an open 
forum for Angela Davis, and, on an annual ba is, the on-campus recruiting 
drives by the armed forces and government police agencies. Historically, 
when student activism has swept both UCSD and the nation , our local

leader of the Left appea red 
to have too much grass-roots 
support, and too much of a 
se nse of their own personal 
vulnerability to be cast on by 
any high -powered actor that 
lurked in authori ty. But, alas, 
the politi cal vi tality of 
student movements almost 
always goes for a swim over 
the summer, and sometimes 
drowns. The student activists 
who have caused the system 
the grea test am ount of 
problems are then left (can 
we , should we, borrow 
President Reagan's favorite 
description of the media's 
recent attitude for him) with 
"the sharks circling the 
waters" around them. From 
then on.Jane Q. Activist must 
fight a variety of vindictive 
forces just to maintain her 
academic livelihood. Jane, 
who does not have the luxury 
of high-priced conservative 
lawyers running to her side 
in an attempt to draw swords 
with the UC administra tion, 
stands Virtually by herself, 
and must depend on the 
goodwill of her friend s, and 
similarly targeted all ies, to 
help her through this awful 
mess. 

There are a number of 
methods that co uld be 
impleme nted within the 
student com munity to 
a lleviate this type of 
discriminanon. We would 
fi rst call for the new AS. 
Council to set up a spec ial 
review board consisting of 
SOCia ll y awa re stude nts. 
facul ty members and staff. 
This review board would 
then assess the nature of all 
the purported "politi ca l 
harrassment" cases that have 
either fallen in the lap of the 
student conduct coordin-
ator. UCSD Police and San 
Diego Police, or have just 
been brought to the attention 
of the UCSD and sur-
rounding communities. The 
board would then present its 
findings to the community, 
and then hopefully be 
allowed to negotiate a 
settlement with the Regents 
themselves. A little bit of 
glasnost on the west coast 
the USA could do no harm.

Abortion 
COnlinued from page 3 

The bill was almost universally 
opposed by audience members 
'T he bill is wrong because it 
removes a woman's nght to control 
her body," said pro-choice 
advocate Marge Zant. 

Pedlatriclanjerty Smith said the 
California Medical Association 
also opposed the bill CMA is 
concerned about anything that 
could delay the woman's getting a 
legal abonion while it can still be 
safely per~ rmed, he said . The only 
alternative open to minors who 
don't wan! to be pregnant may be 
illegal abonlOns performed by 
unqualified surgeons in poor 
tonditions of self-I nduced 
abonions, he said . 

"We all know how horrendous 

"Thb er atz consent bl'l requires 
co untry well fare workers -
untramcd and documented as 
unwilling to act in the c matters-
to maKe the deCISion forthe child ," 
he said . "The child will be without 
legal counselor protection , and 
worst of all , Without her parents 
and their loving suppon. This bill 
IS a sham ," Johnston sa id. 

Lee Kimber, spokesperson for 
the Coumy Welfare Association , 
echoed johnston's charges. "I do 
not believe that SOCial workers 
should advocate for or agams a 
fetus ," he said. 

The evaluallon is highly 
subjective and II1nucnced by the 
views of the social worker ,md 
subject to local political pressure," 
Kimber ald. "To place county 
social workers in the deCISIOn 
making process IS an unfair 
delegation of authority." 

Other negative commems came 

"We all know horrendous [self inflicted 
abortions] are in their outcome in terms of 
serious infection and possible death to the 
mother." 

- Jerry Smith, pediatrician 

Jself-infli ted abonionsJ are In 
their outcome in terms of serious 
Infection and possible death to the

Brian Johnston , executive 
director of the Cahfornia Pro Life

designed to mollify the public as a 
supposed answer to the public 's 
desire for parental consent. It does 
not. 

from acramento Superior Coun

wants ro refund ~700 million to 
taxpayersbyJuly 1, 1987. The state 
would then have two years to 
actually return the money. 

During a heanng of the 
Assembly Ways and Means 
Committee on May 26 , 
Department of Finance Director 

Jesse Huff said Deukmejian would 
like to see the refund come in the 
form of a rebate on next year's tax 
returns. Although HufT declined to 
say what he expects the rebate to 
be, he did say that "it works out to 
$100 for a couple filing a joint 
return" if the refund IS divided 
evenly amongst all taxpayers. 

Democrat lawmakers, however, 
have different Ideas. 

After expressing concerns that 
local governments and schools are 
grossly underfunded, several 

Democrats hinted that they would 
Itke to see voters ovenurn the Gann 
Itmlt and the money to be used to 
Improve state servICes. 

Apparently, acting on recent 
surveys that show reductions In 
state services has lowered voters' 
tax -c utting fervor , Assembly-
member John Vasconcellos, the 
chairperson of the committee , said 
the state could appropnate the 
money now and put It Into an 
escrow account that could not be 
spent until vOters had approved a 
measure ovellurning the Gann 
limit. 

"This may be a way to ensure 
that pubhc agencies that perform 
needed services are adequately 
funded," said Vasconcellos , D-
Santa Clara . 

Huff stronlgy critiCized this 
proposal saying, "it could ofTer an 
opponunity to totaUy ignore the 
constitutional spending limit " 

Assembly Speaker Pro Tempore 
Mike Roos, D-Los Angeles, echoed 
Vasconcellos ' statement. The 
"onerous" limit is greatly hmdenng 
state efforts to combat the state's 
woes, including "the rampantAlDS 
epidemiC, gndlock in LA. and the 
quality of education ," he said . 

Huff, however, said the governor 
is only "being responsive to 
c llizens" who approved the 
constitutional spendmg limit. HI 
feel the constitution must be 

implemented, even if one believes 
It to be onerous." he said . 

"I think the I DeukmeJian J 
administration would be very 
cautious ... about a mechanism 
that could totally ignore the 
co nstitutIOnal lImit: satd Huff, 
who questioned whether elections 
could be held in time to comply 
with the limits time-line 
reqUirements. 

Vasconcellos, however, said "the 
leiter of the law says that you have 
to return th money within twO 
years" If the attempt ro ovenurn 
the Gann limit fails and "we return 
the money wlthm 23 months, we're 
within the letter of the law," he 
said . 

Deukrnejian's other uses for the 
sta te 's unexpected $2.7 billion 
Include $1 billion to pay 
unexpected state bills and 
approximately $900 million for 
Increased spending for all areas of 
educanon , toxic clean-up and 
AIDS research and treatmen! 

The Umversity of California is 
slated to receive '540 million more 
next year for higher faculty salaries 
and co mputer equipment , 
according to the governor's reVised 
budget Deukmejian also plans to 
restore $18.3 million lost when he 
imposed a 1 percent across-the-
board cut on most state agencies in 
mid Januaty . ~

Yearbook recaptures a picture perfect past 
By LISA QUINTANA, )rtl/f \.\ 'W' 

A s the end of vct <mOther school ye,lr d'raws cia e, many of us StM1 wlshmg 
that we could preserve those 
special moments we had during 
the year Unless you happen to be 
an aVid photographer Jble to take 
pictures of every event. 
undoubtedly the most IOgIC31. 
cheapest course of action to take 
would be to buy a ye3rbook. 

Mo t students, espec!ally those 
hVlng off-campus. are not aware 
that UC 0 even has a yearbook 
This IS under tandable In the 26 
years that UC 0 h3S been in 
existence. thiS IS the first time a 
yearbook ha orne out two years 
In a row. AI.' ordmg to Alex 'Wong, 
the current yearbook edltor-In-
chief. there have only been twO 
campus-wide books In UC D's 
hiStOry. and "ea h wem one year 
and collapsed" 

Wong annbutes the collapse of 
the prevlOu staffs to the fan that 
the editors and taff were largely 
graduating semors who wanted to 
create a book that the> were in 
before they left the umverslty After 
the)' left, nobody wanted to take on 
the responsibility of puttmg out 
another yearbook 

PrevlOusl)" each allege had ItS 
own book at one lime or another 
Also. In 1985 . a Semor Portrait 
Book was pubhshed Beside thiS . 
ever)' yeJr, freshmen are 
encouraged to buy Tnt: RaorJ. 
which documents their first year 
These pubhcatlons only ser:'e to 
complicate matters Currently. 
MUIr IS the only college With ItS 
own yearbook, but when all of the 
other college pubhshed one 
nobody cared about a unlverslty-
wtde book. People were more 
Interested In a hook from their 

p3rt1cular college which focused 
more on the people dnd event 
they were familiar with 

Last year, the UC 0 Alumm 
AsSOCiation eM) deCided to reVive 
the campus-wide yearbook . 
e pe lall)' because of UCSD's 25th 
Anniversary festivities. The M 
made arrangements With a 
yearbook publlshmg company 
which recommended Wong 
Wong was the eduor-m- hid of 
hiS high hool yearbook and 
worked closely with this company. 

As editor of UCSD's yearbook, 
Wong recruited a staff, contacted 
the AsSOCiated tudent (A .). and 
lought for office space. among 
other things. As a result of hiS hard 
work. the same organization with 
much of Its ongmal staff Will pUl 
out another yearbook thiS year 

The yearbook staff IS compned 
of 15 students Including 
photographers The org3nl;:allon 
IS non- roflt and IS not funded by 
the A . While the book I pnmanl> 
upported by Alumni the yearbook 

must generate ItS own Income 
Wong said, "Our main goal I to 

SUMMER DOESN'T START UNTIL 
YOU TAKE YOUR FEATURES FINAl!

end 0' the year 

wrap up at the Guardian 
Monday, June 1 at 4:30 pm 

We'll 0110 be 
planning tor fall 

pnnt the book and break even al 
the end." No student registration 
fees go toward the yearbook. 

All of the money students pay for 
the ir yea rbooks goes directly 
tOward printing the books 
Because of thl , the book is very 
basic ThiS )'ear. however, Wong 
went to the A for finanCial 
support and In turn , [hey granted 
the yea rbook S 1.200 for color 
pages. The events covered In color 
Will be the un God Festi val, 
UC Os Open House , Casino 
Night the All-Campus Sem i-
Formal and others. Including orne 
candid photos. 

The malO problem wuh the 
yearbook seems to be publiCity. 
Wong said, "O nly a sma ll 
percentage of students know that 
we even eXIst." Again, it IS mamly 
the students li\1ng on-campus and 
graduallng semors who buy 
yearbooks beLause the), are the 
one whose pi tures are taken for 
the yearbook. Ac ordlng to Wong, 
"It takes four good yearbooks to 
start a ne\\ tradition , In those four 
years, c\et)' Llass h,ls had the 
chance to ~ee a good yearbook " 
CC 0 has been accused of being 
somewhat apathctlc ; however, 
Wong helleves that a good 
>'earbook would help generate 
more school Sp irit - especially 
with the additIOn of a foo tball 
team Publtctty for the yearbook 
works two ways by covering 
certam even ts. the yea rbook 
generates publicity for Itself; those 
same eve nts also benefit from the 

CHINA

)'earbook'~ coverage of them 
A campUS-Wide yearbook would 

contnbute to the unification of the 
four different colleges Wong said , 
"In.,tead of eve lyone gOing around 

~Jymg 'I .Im <I Thl rd student' or 'I 
am a Revelle tudenr: evef}·thlng 
would be contained under one 
roof." tudents would stan leehng 
like UC D students firstly and ,IS 
members of separa te In,mullons 
econdly. 

Wong, howeve r. does not wish 
to de-emphaSize the diverSity of 
the different colleges. One of hiS 
goal IS to expand and receive 
support from the A.S. If this 
happens. he would like to set up 
working committees from each 

Rubes® 

college to handle events 
concel11I ng thel r p<lltIcular college. 
" 0 fJr ," he <;a id . ''I'v(' gottl' n some 
very posItive feedback " 

If the yearbook gctsthe finanCial 
backing from the A.S .• It can either 
expand Illto a larger book with 
more color. or the pnccs can be 
reduced The students benefi t 
either way 

I3ecause of the relative newness 
of the organization. the opponun~ 
time to be orne involved with it is 
now.- BeSides gaming valuable 
experience on the yearbook staff, 
one would also be helping to 
implement a new traditIOn at 
UCSD. ~

The Stanley Cup 
By MIKE HORElICK 
:, r~: .. .Philadelphia Flyers 
remained alive in the Stanley Cup 
Finals when they beat the 
Edmonton Oilers 4 - 3 Tuesday 
night in Edmonton's Norrhlands 
Coliseum. The Flyers, who are now 
down three games to two in the 
seven game series, were led by the 
play of winger Rick Tocchet who 
had two goals and an assist. Also 
vital to the Ayer victory was rookie 
sensation goaltender Ron Hextall 
who stopped breakaways by both 
Paul Coffey and Wayne Gretzky in 
the first period. 

The final series has pitted the 
twO teams with the best records 
duJ:ing the regular season against 
each other. The smooth skating 
Oilers. under the coaching of Glen 
Sather. are trying to erase last year's 
embarrassment of being 
eliminated from the Stanley Cup by 
the Calgary Aames. The loss was 
coupled with an article in Spons 
Illustrated that accused many of 
the Oilers of having problems with 
drugs and alcohol. Forrunately for 
the Oilers. the Winnipegjets upset 
the Calgary Aames this year and 
erased the possibility of an 
Edmonton-Calgary rematch . 
Calgary would probably have 
eliminated Edmonton as they 
repeatedly beat the Oilers during 

the regular season. Despite last 
year's crumbling, the Oilers are this 
year's favorite in the finals due to a 
pOtent offense from scoring stars 
Wayne Gretzky. jari Kurri , and 
Mark Messier. 

The underdog Philadelphia 
Flyers, who play an aggressive, 
hard checking style of hockey. 
have been led to the finals by three 
Flyer superstars' defenseman Mark 
Howe , powerplay speCialist Tim 
Kerr, and goahe Ron Hextall. Mark 
Howe. son of legendary Gordie 
Howe , and his Flyers are relatively 
friendly compared to their 
ancestors the .. Broad Street 
Bullies". The "Bullies" were the 
infamous Flyers team of 1970s who 
settled more than one argument 
with a bench clearing brawl. In 
contrast, this year's Flyers are the 
least penalized team of the Stanley 
Cup Playoffs. 

The Oilers won the first game 4-
2 when Wayne Gretzky, who said 
he was inspired by the play of 
basketball star Larry Bird. scored a 
goal and gOt one assist. Rookie 
goon Kelly Buchberger, who was 
also probably inspired by the play 
of Larry Bird, starred a fight with 
Flyer enforcer Dave Brown which 
served as a message to the Flyers 
that the Oilers would not be 

mtlmidated . 
After the Oilers won game twO In 

ove nime , the scene hifted to the 
Spec trum in Philadelphia . 
Phtladelphla IS known for its 
callous fans who many say "would 
boo a cure for cancer." When play 
starred , Wayne Gretzky was 
checked hard by Ayer Lindsay 
Carson. ThiS shocked Gretzky 
who. with an ample supply of 
bodyguards, is more used to 
receiving checks that can be 
quickly converted into cash . 
Despite the check, Edmonton 
Jumped out to a three to zero lead. 
However, the Flyers didn't forget 
that a videotape of Kate Smi th 
si nging "God Bless Amenca" was 
played before the game. Kate Smith 
is to the Ayers what bananas are to 
monkeys , and the fired up Flyers 
went on to win 5 - 3. 

The Flyers were not as 
successful in game four as Wayne 
Grerzky set up three of four Oher 
goals. Controversy occurred when 
Oiler Glenn Anderson slashed at 
goalie Ron Hextall. After no penalty 
was caUed , HextaU looked like 
George Washington as he 
chopped down Swede Kent 
Nilsson in from of the Flyer ncr. 
The game ended on a similar note 
as a disappointed Flyer fan took a 
swipe at Edmonton coach Glen 
Sather. 

Excitement is sure to continue 
as the teams travel to Philadelphia 
for the sixth game in the Spectrum.

Tough way to lose 
Losing a game in which you pitch a no-hitter IS one thing, but 

losing it the way joe Conese did has gOt to make you a little crazy. 
Conese, a junior righthander from Miami of Ohio. lost the game. 2-
0, to Ohio UniverSity because of a rather humiliating misplay by 
one of his outfielders. 

In the first inning, with a runner on first base for Ohio U., Conese 
was pitching to Mike Aorak. Aorak hit a deep fly t9 right, and 
rightfielder Chris Tommelein got into pOSition to make the catch. 
But, instead of an easy out, the ball hit Tommelein on the topof the 
head and bounced over the fence for a four-base error. 

Neither team scored the rest of the way and Conese never gave 
up a hit. 

Ovemutd by Bill Mazeroski's Baseball '87 were these quips and 
quotes: 

"He passed me on the all-time strikeout list a couple of years ago 
and nobody asked me about thar." -Mickey Mantle when asked to 
comment on Reggie Jackson passing his career home run mark. 

"Hey joe. good call on that steal play. You were in great position. [ 
admire the way you guys get on top of aU those plays." -A.L. umpire 
joe Brinkman on what he never hears from managers. 

"People in New York have black teeth and their breath smells of 
beer and the men are even worse ." -Charlie Kerfeld , Houston 
Astros reliever. during the 1986 ational League playoffs . 

"It's a ?low to your ego to get released by the worst ream in the 
universe .' -Chns Welsh of the Cincinnati Reds on being released 
by Texas. 

"Some guys just always get the green light. " -Nolan Ryan. after 
an unsuccessful attempt to steal second base . 

"The first time I got in a bullpen car there, they told me to lock the 
doors ." -Oriole Mike Aanagan, on why he could never pitch for 
New York. 

JuS( a little w.lming to Boston Red Sox starter Roger Clemens: 
Since 1979, no American League Cy Young winner has followed his 
award year with a winning season. In fact, the past five winners still 
active have a combined 39-53 record since their award years.

Manhattan Transfer, Chick

Joni Mitchell, and Weather 
Report all have in common? 
They have all relied on the 
percussive talents of super~ 
drummer, Alex Acuna. 

What do Herbie 
Hancock, Jaco Pastorias, 
and Bob James have in

on guitarist Randy 
Bernsen's albums on MCA. 

Why am I even bringing 
this up? Why are you even 
reading this? Because these 
guys are coming here, to 
UCSD, for our Second 
Annual Jazz Festival, and 
the best part is - it's free!! 
World-class jazz talent for 
the price of breathing - a 

"can't~miss" proposition. 
The festival, to take place 

Sunday, May 31, from 1:00 
to 7:00 pm, will be held at 
"Stonehenge," more 
formally known as the 
Undergraduate Library 
lawn. Food and drinks 
combined with an opti~ 
mistic w~ath~r outlook 
should make for a great day 
of jazz in the sun. Ask 
anyone who was smart or 
fortunate enough to catch 
last year's extravaganza, 
one that featured Al 
Jarreau's rhythm section 
with UCSD alumni, 
Nathan East on bass and 
Peter Sprague on guitar. 

Alex Acuna is probably 
best known in the jazz 
world for his stint with 
supergroup, Weather 
Report, having performed 
on 'the jazz album most 
likely to be bought in the 
late '70s, Heavy Weather. 
He'll be making a rare 
appearance in the leader's

seen him perform live, 

by bryce ringle 
possibly with Al Jarreau or

forefront is long overdue. 
As for Randy Bernsen,

It was a late "night" for 

Doug Forbes. This recent UC 
Berkeley graduate had been in 
the ticket holders line since 
12:30 am and it wasn't until 
1:00 pm when he would be 
allowed into the theatre. Doug 
was just one of the many hard~ 
core David Letterman fans 
who invaded Las Vegas the 
week of May IB~21 to see 
Letterman live and in~person. 

Signs of the nationwide 
pilgrimage were apparent as 
the usual polyester~clad 
tourists were joined by young, 

casually~attired collegiates. 
They had come from as far 

as Cleveland, Phoenix, 
Portland, and San Diego 
bearing signs, T~shirts and 
even a (LBNIGHT) license 
plate. 

Letterman madt: two 
announct:ments in mid-April 
inviting viewers to write in for 
tickets to the Vegas tapings. 

, Within a week, NBC was 
barraged with over 15,000 
requests which they filled on a 
first-come, first~served basis. 
The 'Xegas sojourn marked 
only -tne third time the 

popular show had gone on the 
road in its five~year history. 

Once inside Bally's colossal 
Ziegfield Theatre, the 
audience anticipated any sign 
cfLettermanor his entourage. 
All it took was a minor 
celebrity to divert the 
audience and elicit an 
enthusiastic response. 

The show's announcer, Bill 
Wendell, thanked us for 
coming, told us the "rules," 
and introduced Paul Shaffer's 
"Late Night" band. joined by 
saxophone great David 
Sanborn, the band geared up 
the audience for Letterman's 
entrance. 

The audience went wild and 
gave him a standing ovation as 
Letterman casually and 
confidently strolled out. The 
audience ate up the banter 
between Shaffer and 
Letterman, as well as every 
word that Letterman uttered . 

Chris Elliott, decked-out in 
a sequined dinner jacket, 
appeared as "Skylark," a local 
Vegas celebrity. Larry "Bud" 
Melman's actions were typical 
as he lost on the stage slot 

machine and consequently 
yelled, "You lose, suckers!" 
Along with the magic acts, 
jugglers and Vegas greats, the 
two were characteristic of the 

Vegas~style entertainment 
fea tured throughout the 
week. 

Letterman demonstrated 
what is part and parcel of his 

mass~appeal - his down~to~ 
earth, off-the-cuff manner. 
The way he interacted with 
the sauntering showgirls,- as 
well as the quick talk with 
Robert Goulet was definitely 
Letterman style. This five~ 
time Emmy Award winner, 
who is surprisingly 40 years 
old, built his reputation on his 
smart-ass manner . Fans 
identify with Letterman 
because he seems to be able to 
say and do exactly what he 
wants. 

As the show ended , all felt 
that the trek was more than 
worth the effort. Viewers will 
be happy to know that 
Letterman recently signed a 
new long-term contract and 
will be expanding to five 
nights. 

Washing Machines," is 
said by Guitar Player 
Magazine to be "show~ 
casing one of the broadest 
varieties of guitar synth 
sounds on record : " 
Downbeat magazine ' s 
CritiCS, usually hard to 
please, say, "This lad has a 
great future, judging by the 
impact of this fine 
album ... Let's hear more 
from this guy." Lucky for 
us, his great future includes 
a performance here 
without a $15 ticket, two~ 
drink minimum, and $5.00 
parking spot. 

Also appearing will be a 
local fusion consort, Speed 
of Sound, and the Bird~like 
bop saxaphone of Charles 
McPherson and his quartet. 

A lot of people and 
organizations need to be 
thanked for putting 
together such a quality 
event. Festival organizer, 
David Wells, UEO, Dr. 
Watson's office, Joel 
Schachne and the A.S., 
SAAC, Third College 
council, Revelle College, 
Warren College, AASU, 
and the Muir College 
council all have contri~ 
buted greatly to what 
hopefully will be an 
ongoing, annual event. 
Wouldn't it be amazing if 
there w:.s a Reggae Festival, 
a Blues Festival, and a Jazz 
Festival next year? 
Witnt:ssing events like this 
year's Sun God Festival 
helps me believe it 's 
possible. Maybe UCSD 
will become more of a 
center for culture than it 
already is. Enough 
hypothesizing come 
check out some jazz this 
Sunday.

An arresting n10vie 
by phil macgovern 

When I heard that Beverly 
Hills Cop II was coming out, I 
immediately thought, "Oh 
no, not again!" I, like most 
people, had seen Eddie 
Murphy as Axel Foley in the 
original Beverly Hills Cop. 
Unlike most people, however, 
I did not find the first really 
" l'2.d" or even "awesome." 
You see, as I am a cultured 
type of guy, my standard 
movie is shown by people 

with odd haircuts and has 
subtitles. So when I was given 
the assignment of reviewing 
Beverly Hills Cop II, I relished 
the chance of trashing another 
movie. I was dead wrong. 

'I 

Beverly Hills Cop II is not the 
Eddie Murphy showcase that I 
expected. True, he is the star 
and all and he is on the screen 
an awful lot, but instead of 
playing Eddie Murphy, he 
played Axel Foley. That is

I liked this movie. With Eddie 
Murphy gone, I could sit back 
and enjoy the film . It was 
funny and well written.

liked was the fact that the

violin instruction is similar to 
how young children learn

Another reason I expected 

this movie to be really bad is 
that it was directed by Tony 
Scott. If you are not up on the 
movie business, Tony Scott 
directed Top Gun. I hated that 
movie, and most critics felt 
the same way (except for 
those from USA Today). But 
Mr. Scott does a much better 
job with this movie. 
Everything is crisp and fast-
paced. Scott takes a good 
script and makes a good 
movie.

Getting 
out the 
Kinks 

by john shaw 
After concluding a 

critically acclaimed 11 city 
mini-tour of small U.S. 
theatres earlier this year, 
the Kinks are on the road 
again. The 23-year-old 
band will kick off its 20 
date U.S . .:our June 2 at 
Golden Hall with "The 
Knack. " 

"Think Visual," the 
band's 25th LP, is a decent 
collection of corporate 
critiques, pleasant ballads, 
and a metallesque rock 
anthem. The band's co-
founders, brothers Ray and 
Dave Davies, both pen 
tracks on the album; 
however lead vocalist Ray 
dominates once again. Ray, 
a visual artist prior to 
joining the Kinks, devotes 
three of his eight 
compositions to the video 
revolution. 

Ray's disdain for fly-by-
night video rental 
proprietors and the video 
culture is vented in the 
addictive blues-flavored 
"Welcome to Sleazy 
Town" as well as in the 
quirky "Video Shop." The 
albums title track, "Think 
Visual," extends on the 
image over content theme 
predominant on several of 
the album's tracks. 

Ray is also critical of the 
musk business, "Working

Mix business with pleasure? 

Why not? The Freaky 
Executives always do. Take a 
memo: Presently the most 
successful original band on 
the northern California 
nightclub circuit, the Freaky 
Executives know how to turn 
hedonistic pursuit into 
lucrative enterprise. 

The Freaky Executives 
market music described as an 
assemblage of "dance, funk, 
salsa, reggae, blues, Latin, and 
rock-and-roll," said Gary 
Falcon, road manager for the 
band. Hailing from Berkeley, 
the band has been together for 
the 'past three years. The 
Freaky Executives consist of 
Scott Roberts (lead vocals), 
Marc'Baum (saxophone), Dan 
Reagan (trombone), Steve 
Carter (keyboards), Mike 
Maung (lead guitar), Andre 
Johnson (rhythm guitar), Eric 
McCann (bass), and Jay Lane 
(drums). 

This visually provocative 
band presents Happy Hour 
ipteraction between the 
musicians as well as with their 
audiences. On the agenda for 
this musical meeting are 
choreographed movements 
and instrumental solos. Billed 
as "urban funk" and "world 
beat," they are moguls of 
rhythm and rap on the 

sidewalks of the concrete 
jungle. 

The band frequently takes 
their business on the road to 
southern California, appear-
ing at clubs like the 
"Palomino" in North 
Hollywood and the "Belly-Up 
Tavern" in Solana Beach. 
Experience this revolt or 
reprieve from the 9-5 
"crowd" and watch for the 
Freaky ExecutitJes in the San 
Francisco area during the 
summer. The Freaky 
Executives also have appeared 
at UCSD twice this year, once 
at a T.G., and most recently at 
the UCSD Sun God Festival. 
Falcon added that college 
crowds provided the "Best 
response, and are the most 
devoted" to the Freaky 
ExecutitJes - and said that 
"UCSD knows how to 
party!" 

Exposure from constant 
touring has been profitable 
for the band, Warner Records 
has just signed with the Freaky 
ExecutitJes for an album due to 
be released this upcoming fall. 

Lead vocalist Scott Roberts 
ended a recent show in Los 
Angles with the order, II Never 
let anything come between 
you and having a good time!" 
And that is business as usual 
for the Freaky ExecutitJes. 

Stone-
Walling 

by robert leone 
Just when you thought it 

was safe to go back into the 
movie theaters after 
"Pia toon," II Apoca I ypse 
Now" director Francis Ford 
Coppola has made another 
Vietnam film. 

"Gardens of Stone" is a 
Vietnam film that, believe it 
or not, is not set in Vietnam. 
It's set in Fort Myers, Florida 
and Arlington National 
Cemetery, across the Potomac 
from the Lincoln and 
Jefferson Memorials . Instead 
of young, fired-up, highly-
trained, green combat troops, 
we've got veteran sergeants in 
a ceremonial unit that's 
"show business." How do 
you get the Vietnam War out 
of that? 

Sergeant Hazard (J ames 
Caan) wants out of the 
ceremonial3rd Brigade unit in 
the U.S. Army and into the 
Fort Benning Infantry School, 
where he can teach young 
soldiers how not to die during 
combat. He's got few illusions 
about the Vietnam War after 
two tours of duty there. He 
thinks the war is an 
unwinnable mistake. His 
girlfriend, a Washingcon Post 
reporter, portrayed by 
Angelica Huscon, thinks the 
war is genocide. 

A young soldier in Hazard's 

platoon, a guy named Willow 
(D. B. Sweeney), thinks the 
war is winnable and just; he 
wants to go to Vietnam. 
Willow's girlfriend's father 
thinks the war is great because 
it improves his research and 
development budget. 

This is material which any 
scenarist or scriptwriter 
would kill for, but somehow 
former entertainment lawyer 
Ronald Bass has managed to 
make hash of it . The film 
concentrates on its own plot 
to the exclusion of the rest of 
the world. This leaves us with 
an odd vision of the U.S. 
Army as an organization run 
by Master Sergeants for their 
own benefit through an old 
boy network . And we spend 
ten minutes waiting for 
Willow's coffin to come back 
from Vietnam. That's okay by 
me, because Sweeney can't 
act. It just takes too long to 
happen. 

Fortunatdy, James Caan, 
J ames Earl JonI.' (as Caan's 
foul-mouthed old war 
buddy), and Huston c.:an act. 
They've got great characters 
to work with, so if you want to 

see some pros at work on rich 
material, this is a good film. 
Just don't expect it to be too 
coherent. 

Arrest 
Continued from page 2 

In this sequel, Bogomil gets 
shot by an unknown, Axel 
hears about it and rushes out 
to Beverly Hills to find the 
killers. Rosewood and 
Taggart, having been demoted 
to traffic cops by the new 
police chief, help Axel in his 
task. Once more, they put 
their jobs on the line. Axel, 
Rosewood and Taggart solve 
the crime, trying to protect 
innocent civilians from the 
wrath of the evil-doers. Did 
you come expecting a tear-
jerker, or perhaps a 
consciousness raising 
experience? No way, this is 
your basic Eddie Murphy 
movie, a variation on the 
action-adventure theme: 
Action! Adventure/Comedy. 
It is a smooth mix of comedy 
and violence, of laughs and car 
chases.

Wid ow Simone perfectly, 
playing the role with just the 
right amount of vanity and 
pomposity, but never over-
acting, as it seems the way to 
which the tole w uld lend it elf. 
Equally as impressive is Edward 
Stierle, who plays Alain, Lise's 
future contract husband , who 
fills the tage with his hilarious 
antics. His face tells us all we 
need to know about Alain, that 
he is a somewhat dense boy 
trying to do his best. 

I have alway liked -lassical 
music and have been to variou 
symphonies around the ountry; 
unfortunately , classical music 
performances are only as exciting 
as one's interest in the music. I 
ha ve been told in the past to close 
my eyes in order to picture the 
music; I have also been to the 
opera, but I could nev r 
understand the words. The first 
ballet that I've ever seen was the 
Joffrey Ballet's produ tion of 
"Le Fille Mal Gardee" during 
th eir recent San Diego 
performance. 

The ballet includes classi al 
music, but instead of watching 
the musi ians perform, you 
watch the dancing. The dancers 
are, along with the musi ,telling 
a story utilizing the universal 
language of the eyes. 

The Joffrey Ballet is 
considered by many to be 
America' premiere ballet 
company, and from what lsaw, I 
understand why. The perfor-
mance was beautiful to watch 
because the dancing was 
spectacular and the acting 
superb. "Le Fille Mal Gardee" 
(which mean literally "The 
Daughter Badly Guarded") is a 
love story written by Sir 
Frederick Ashton in the late 
1700s. It has been revised for 

modern audien e . 
Lise is the beautiful daughter 

of Widow Simone. Because she 
is now of marrying age, Widow 
Simone sets up a marriage 
between Lise and the simpleton 
son of a wealthy land owner. Of 
course, Lise is in love with 
someone else. Her heart belongs 
to Colas, a poor young farmer. 
Finally, the young lovers 
triumph as Widow Simone 
consent to their marriage. 

Tina Le Blan and David 
Palmer portray Lise and Colas 
respectively, and they are filled 
with the innocent sensuality that 
their roles deserve. Their dancing 
seemed flawless, though I am not 
an expert. I was constantly awed 
by the acrobatic-type move-
ments they made and how their 
bodies seemed like fluid . But 
they were not the only 
spectacular dancers in the cast. 
The rest of the cast, 45 in all , 
were great, even when all of them 
were on the stage at once. The 
young men and women were 
always smiling as if the simple 
peasant life was the happiest life 
possible. The choreography was 
brilliant, never ceasing to amaze 
the audience. 

I have been told that the acting 
in a ballet is just as important as 
the dancing. In ballet, the dancers 

When I look back on the 
whole experience, I can do 
nothing but smile and feel good. 
The fantastic Joffrey Ballet was a 
definitely an experience, and one 
that I would recommend to every 

ne. Alas, the Joffrey has left San 
Diego, and will not be returning 
until next year. But they are 
touring the country, and if they 
are somewhere near where your 
travels take you, go and see them. 
If not, clip this article and tape it 
to your refrigerator as a reminder 
of next year's performances.

Kink out 
Continued from page 2 
at the Factory" cha rges 
record companies with 
forcing musicians to churn 
out songs as if they were 
working on assembly lines. 
The critique is interesting, 
the song is not. 

The album contains 
three pleasant ballads, an 
area in which the Kinks 
consistently produce good 
material. "Lost and 
Found" is an upbeat story 
of two lovers who grow 
closer after facing a New 
York storm . "Killing 
Time," easily one of the 
best tracks on the LP, is 
reminiscent of the mate rial 
on the Kinks 1981 LP, 
"Give the People What 
They Want." Two friends 
who haven't seen each 
other for quite some time 
meet on the street in the 
third ballad, " How Are 
You. " 

Lead guitarist Dave 
Davies writes and sings two 
songs on this album. "Rock 
and R oll Cities," the 
album's first single, is a silly 

and fun rock anthem. The 
tune verges on metal, a 
sound some say Dave 
invented in the early-60s 
hit, "You Really Got Me." 
" When You W ere a 
Child," Dave's o ther 
effort, fails miserably . 

This is not the Kinks ' 
best work, but that is not to 
say it is bad work . Several 
tracks remind the listener 
that the band is still capable 
of producing likable songs 
and should not be 
dismissed just yet. 

" Think Visual" provides 
the Kinks with a few more 
crowd pleasers to add to 
their already classic-laden 
repertoire . With old 
favorites like "Lola," 
"Well Respected Man," 
and "Celluloid Heroes" 
and new favorites like 
"Welcome to Sleazy 
Town," " Killing Time," 
and "Lost and Found," the 
Kinks' "Think Visual" tour 
is sure to gain critical 
acclaim and audience 
respect.
