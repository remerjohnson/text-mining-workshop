Racism Examined 
In UC System 

Senator Torres Speaks at UCLA 
By SHANA CHANDLER 

and TINA ANIMA 
from the UCLA DAILY BRUIN 

Racism took center stage on 
campus Tuesday as State legisla-
tors probed allegations of racism 
and ethnic insensitivity through-
out the University of California 
system. 

Senator Art Torres chaired a 
five-hour state Senate committee 
hearing in a crowded hearing 
room at UCLA. The hearings are 
part of a series designed to look at 
education in the UC system. 

Torres and other members of 
the Senate Special Committee on 
UC Admissions heard testimony 
from undergraduates, graduates 
and official representatives from 
throughout the system. 

"The grievances we heard 
[today] are real," said Marjorie 
Green, Western States education 

director and a member of the 
Anti-Defamation League. 

"Tensions are being allowed to 
fester," she said. UCLA has the 
potential to alleviate some of those 
tensions, Green said. 

"We have to ask, 'If not [in the 
universities] where should such 
efforts begin?'" 

Problems with racial tension 
have risen as the number of people 
of color on campuses has in-
creased, said UC Berkeley Sociol-
ogy Professor Troy Duster. Sud-
denly, the proportion of white 
students being admitted was 
threatened. 

"There was a clash of a sense of 
entitlement," he said. 

When research is the main focus 
of the public university system, 
concern with the education of 
incoming students takes second 
place, speakers said. 

Amphitheater: What Might Have Been 
Despite testimony from a wide 

range of students about racial and 
ethnic insensitivity on campuses, 
many adminstrations have made 
strides to address those concerns, 
said Alice Cox, assistant vice 
president of student services in 
the UC Office of the President. 
But their best efforts never would 
eradicate the problems, she said.

In the wake of last week's disas-
trous concert, students are ques-
tioning UCSD's lack of a large 
concert venue. Despite two recent 
proposals to build an amphi-
theater, presently no concrete 
plans exist for such a facility. 

There has been talk in the 
administration of building a major 
Events Center east of Interstate S, 
but no money has been allocated 
for it. 

In the words of an administra-
tion source who did not wish to be 
identified, "[The Events Center] is 
merely a gleam in our eyes at this 
point." 

An amphitheater has been an 
object of discussion on campus 
foryears . In 1979-J980A.S. Pres-
ident Carlos Montalvo proposed 
that an amphitheater be built in 
Finger Canyon, northeast of Cen-
tral Library. 

The amphitheater would be a 
sloped grassy area with a stage. 
At first it would not have seats, 
but later temporary and perman-
ent seats would be installed as 
money became available. 

But when Montalvo graduated, 
his plan died. 

Later, in 1985, the chancellor 
formed the Amphitheater Program 
Advisory Task Group to look 
into building an amphitheater. 

OnJune6,1985, the committee 
sent a report to the chancellor, 

• OPINION ••. 4 
• FEA lURES ..••• 8 

• SPORTS ••••••.••• 12 
• ClASSIFIEDS ......... 11 
o Ius hiatus 0 

recommending that an amphi-
theater be built in Finger Canyon. 

An Environmental Impact Re-
port was also filed. 

According to University Events, 
Students Activities director Lynn 
Peterson, also a committee mem-
ber, the report did not object to 
the building of the amphitheater 
in Finger Canyon. 

According to Peterson the 
report lsaid the amphitheater] 
would blend into the natural 
ambiance of the area. " 

The amphitheater would be a 
permanent, covered stage area 
with 3000-5000 fixed seats. A 
grassy slope would be behind the 
stage, which could have more 
seating for major events. 

In addition, the amphitheater 
would be "artfully rendered, .. 
according to Peterson, "not a 
barn-like structure." 

During the UCSD twenty-ruth 
anniversary fund-raising drive, a 
goal of one million dollars was set 
to be raised to go toward building 
an amphitheater. 

Unfortunately, according to 
Joseph Calger, Data Processing 
manager of University Relations, 
nowlJere near S I million was raised. 
dollars was raised. 

In fact, "Not enough [was 
raised] to even go ahead with 
thinking about it." 

The money that was donated to 
the amphitheater project cannot 
be used for anything else, because 
it was donated specifically for the 
amphitheater.

Truth and Soul 

As a result, according to Calger, 
the money will remain unused 
until an amp.hitheater is built. 

Since the committee turned in 
its report Peterson knows of no 
action on the amphitheater idea. 
She is disappointed: ". was eager 
to see this come forth." 

In Spring 1986, students over-
whelmingly said yes to Proposi-
tion 1, which asked students if 
they would support the building 
of an amphitheater on campus. 

A.S. Director of Activities 
Randy Woodard said there are 
many aspects to look into when 
considering building an amphi-
theater: location, size, parking 
and sound spill. "You couldn't 
put it on Muir Field," Woodard 
said, because the noise would dis-

turb residents of La Jolla Farms 
and the dorms. 

(Noise has become a problem 
at concerts recently, with the 
Untouchables two years ago and 
the Reggaefest last year both 
cancelled midstream because of 
noise complaints). He also men-
tioned a concern for the nature of 
acts and events. 

"There should be a balanced 
program that will attract not just 
students, but also the community, 
staff and faculty. Acts should not 
be of just one sort: there may be 
Barry Manilow along with 
AC/ DC," said Woodard. 

When asked for comment, A.S. 
Programming Commissioner Jona-
than Judaken laid all the blame 

See THEATER, pale 7 

"UC [cannot] eliminate com-
pletely from its population the 
threads of prejudice and bigotry 
woven into the fabric of American 
society," she said. 

Torres said he feared that chan-
cellors would ignore UC President 
David Gardner's Sept. 26 plea 
that each campus would increase 
efforts to include women and 
Dlinorities in their faculties and 
student bodies would "be very 
powerful. " 

UCLA already has made strides 
in increasing the number of mi-
nority students, said Chairman of

UCSB Former Chancellor 
Begins Community Service 

Former UCSB Chancellor Robert Huttenback is 
expected to begin 1,000 hours of community service 
this week by teaching functionally illiterate convicted 
criminals to read for the Santa Barbara City Adult 
Literacy Program. 

Huttenback, who was sentenced to community 
service earlier this month after being convicted on 
charges of embezzlement and tax evasion, will be 
asked to develop a literacy program for adults and 
convicted criminals older than 16 who are on 
probation, Santa Barbara Chief Probation Officer 
Sue Gionfriddo said Tuesday. 

Huttenback's assignment Monday snuffed requests 
by the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District and 
other groups who asked that Huttenback perform his 
community service in Isla Vista. 

According to Gionfriddo, Huttenback's educational 
ba.ckground is well suited to the state-funded literacy 
program, where approximately 90 people are 
currently learning about reading and writing from 
library volunteers. With his assistance, the program 
might be expanded to include illiterate inmates at 
local prisons. 

Huttenback may appeal his conviction at any time 
during the 60 day period following his Sept. 7 
sentencing, according to Senior Deputy District 
Attorney Darryl Perlin, one of two prosecuting 
attorneys in the Huttenback case. 

Huttenback was found guilty in July of embezzling 
more than $250,000 in university funds to improve 
and repair his private home in Mission Canyon while 
he was head of UCSB. In addition, he was found 
gUilty of tax evasion and was ordered by the court to 
pay a fine of $60,000.

Governor Signs Bill 

Gay Bathhouses May Close 
By RACHEL E. BOEHM 
Sial! Writer. Daily Californian 

BERKELEY - The Steam-
works, a prime nighttime lure for 
many Berkeley gays, may have to 
close its doors if a bill outlawing 
gay bathhouses is signed into law 
by Governor George Deukmejian. 

The bill, which would outlaw 
bathhouses whose primary func-
tion is to promote sexual relations 
between gay men, passed easily 
through both houses of the legis-
lature last month. Its author, 
Assemblymember Bill Bradley 
(R-Escondido), said he expects 
the governor to sign the legislation. 

But Lois Wallace, a spokes-
person for Deukmejian, said 
Thursday the governor had not 
yet seen the legislation. She de-
clined to comment on the bill. 

Bradley said, "If we had this 
bill 10 years ago, we wouldn't 
have the AIDS epidemic right 
now. Some of these guys brag 

about having 100 partners or so a 
month." 

"To me, a bathhouse is no 
different than a brothel, except in 
a brothel, money changes hands, .. 
he said. 

The Steamworks is one of only 
three gay bathhouses in the Bay 
Area to survive the AIDS epi-
demic scare. As many as 20 San 
Francisco gay bathhouses closed 
down after health officials im-
posed strict regulations on their 
operations. 

A Steamworks manger, who 
declined to give his name, refused 
to comment on the bill. 

If the bill is approved, Bradley 
said, a court hearing would de-
termine whether a bathhouse like 
the Steamworks is "set up for gay 
purposes," and could be shut 
down by the district attorney. 

.. ] think the response (to the 
bill) will be very favorable," 
Bradley said. "People are running 
scared." 

Margie Swartz, legislative di-

rector of the American Civil 
Liberties Union, said the group 
opposes closing any gay bath-
house before it has been con-
clusively proven to be a health 
risk. 

Swartz said many bathhouses 
serve as an outlet for education 
and information about safe sex, 
helping to prevent the spread of 
AIDS. 

"We do not want bathhouses 
closed just because there's sex 
going on," she said. "Some of the 
bathhouses are putting out (edu-
cational) pamphlets, and it might 
be the only way to reach a certain 
popUlation. " 

In response to a series of 
meetings with gay activists and 
city health officials who feared 
that customers might be using the 
facility as a site for unsafe sex, 
owners ofthe Steamworks earlier 
this year agreed to tum up their 
lights, increase AIDS education 
efforts, and revamp a room pre-
viously used for group sex.

Monserratt said. 

But Young said he had con-

o P7hLlvcr~uu~ o~N ___ _ 
----------------------------------~ 

I n the good old days, when 1 was a genuinely stylish chill , I~fe was simpler. My days were slow, my nights were fast, and my hfe was 
a life of crime. My enemies agreed that I was dangerously good at 

my work. 
I loved to steal. I loved bombs and fire and the sound of breaking 

glass. It was that simple. There was no profit motive, no hidden 
agenda, and life was good to me. 

The only cri mes they ever nailed me for were either the small ones 
or the false ones. They never touched me for the high ones, the truly 
crazy things . . . These are the ones I remember now, in perfect detail: 
the ones that caused my adrenal glands to swell and pump like the 
lungs of an Inca . 

I t was midnight on Sunday when Skinner called to ask if I'd made up my mind about taking the job as senionr media. consultant for the Dukakis for President campaign. 1 told him I probably 
wouldn't do it, but only for reasons of personal laziness, not because 
I had any fear of getting beaten by a high-rent yo-yo act like Bush. 

"The man is a liar," I said, and in the end it will bring him down. 
The record shows that he lied repeatedly about his role in the Iran-
contra disaster. He should have been indicted along with North and 
Poindexter. 

"Ridiculous," he said. "George knew nothing. He was neutralized. 
They11 never lay a glove on him." 

"What?" I shouted. "You arrogant bastards! You know he lied! 
How do you expect to get away with this? The voters won't stand for 
it. " 

"The voters are swine," he said. "They will vote their wallets," he 
chuckled. "You were right about this generation," he said. "We can 
bend them like spaghetti-especially the women. George ripped the 
eyeshadow off that gender 'gap' nonsense, didn't he?" 

"Never mind that," I said. "The man is guilty." 
"There is no case," Skinner replied . "No case and no guilt. We had 

him neutralized . Anything he ever knew about the Iran-contra deal 
will be thrown out of court by compelling medical evidence." 

I laughed . "Sure," I said . "What is it going to be, Epstein-Barre 
Syndrome?" 

"Ho, ho," he said. "You liberal dingbats are all the same, aren't 
you? The last time you showed any class was when Jack Kennedy 
beat Nixon." He chuckled again. "What about a 'hypnotism defense,' 
dumbo? Can your people handle that one?" 

1 reached for more whiskey and tried to keep alert. There was an 
evil edge in his voice. 

"I warned you," he hissed. "George will never be indicted for 
anything. He is innocent. We had him fixed. He was under the 
influence of a hypnotist the whole time." 

"What?" 1 said. 
"Sure," he replied . " We had it figured out from the start. He was 

too important, so we called in a big-time shrink from Brazil, Dr. 
Squane; he's famous all over the world." 

I knew Squane. He has hovered on the gray fringe of politics for 
many years, mainly because of his radical drug cures, but recently he 
has been into full-bore , high-dollar hypnotism. 

"It's fool-proof," said Skinner. "Squane put him in .a trance and 
they programmed him so he 'd go into a coma every time he heard 
anybody say anything about the Iran-contra trouble. Squa':le re-
duced it down to nine or 10 key words that would turn George IOto a 
pod every time he heard them. His eyes w~uld roll back into ~is h;ad 
and his brain would go blank. He couldn t remember anythlOg. 

T he politics business is hag-ridden by weird stories based mainly on rumor and gossip . The really good ones are not 
always true, but they are passed along anyway becuase they 

usually have a moral, some keen and timeless point. And ~mo.ng the 
best of these is the story about how Lyndon Jo~nson, l':l hiS first 
campaign for the Senate in 1948, cam~ from beh~nd .to W.IO a close 
election by maneuvering his opponent IOto a pubhc SituatIOn where 
he was forced to deny that he regularly enjoyed carnal knowledge of 
the sows he kept in his barnyard . 

Johnson got the idea when he saw that he was going to lose unless 
he did something desperate. But his campaign manager- who also 
hated and feared defeat- was shocked when Johnson instructed him 
to call a press conference and go public with the bestiality charges. 

"We can't say that , Lyndon,"the manager protested . "It's horrible. 
And besides, it's not true." 

"I know, "said Johnson, "but let's make the son of a bitch deny it." 
A week later Johnson squeaked through by 87 votes. It may have 

been a minor election in Texas, but it turned out to have major effects 
on the history of the nation . Twenty-five years later, after climbing 
the long cruel ladder of power politics in Washington, it wa Lyndon 
Baines Johnson, 36th president of the United States, who made a 
fateful decision to commit 100,000 American troops to a "small war" 
in Vietnam that ended in disaster, disgrace and defeat.

Crowd Was 
Mishandled 

The Untouchables seem to be 
synonymous with disappointment 
at UCS D. The shutdown of la t 
Friday's concert was clearly not 
an example of an incredible Fri-
day and was totally uncalled for. 

The Untouchables were whim-
pering about crowding and rowd-
iness when they should've been 
glad to see so many fans, co nsid-
ering that their last UCSD per-
formance, at the 1987 Sun God 
Festival, was also shut down. The 
only reasons the crowd became 
upset were the disorganization 
and the lousy sound system. 

1 heard someone say, "You get 
what you pay for," which may 
very well be true, but the Un-
touchables were paid extremely 
well, I'm sure, somewhere around 
$2,000 per barely audible song. 

The A.S. should have realized 
that people from other schools 
around the county also knew 
about the concert. UCSD's image 
really took a beating along with 
that of the band. From past expe-
rience, the police should have 
known that major security would 
be needed even if there was a lack 
of communication between the 
A.S. and the police. A rope barri-
cade just wouldn't cut it for any 
band. 

Telling the crowd to step back 
was one of the more comedic 
events ofthe evening. To actually

Only The Shadow Knows 

expect that everyone of three to 
five thousand people would actu-
ally take ten steps back, right, 
sure. It was also great that the 
security guards bothered to show 
up at the end of the concert 
instead of being there to begin 
with. 

If they had thought enough to 
set up a stage about four feet high 
on the top step there probably 
would not have been any prob-
lems. The concert should have 
been held in a much larger area, 
such as Mile High Field. 

What a wonderful image UCSD 
presented. We can't be trusted to 
pull through any events unless 
there is better planning and com-
munication between organiza-
tions. You can't possibly have a 
band as big as the Untouchables 
come to UCSD and expect only a 
few hundred people.

Herd Mentality at the BGIF 
Herd Was 
The Cause 

ByJONATHANJUDAKEN 
A.S. Programming Commissioner 

What should we make of the 
spectacle that occurred last Fri-
day night at the Untouchables 
concert, and what are its reper-
cussions? 

The fundamental cause con-
tributing to the uncontrollable 
nature of the event on Friday 
was a "mob-mentality." Stud-
ents forgot to reflect and simply 
reacted. It was a blind un-
leashing of the will of the mass 
to the detriment of everybody. 

The people who weren't 
invited, the people from off 
campus, significantly contribu-
ted to the mindlessness of the 
mob. But this should not be a 
criticism of the event because 
UCSD should be a locus for 
activities within the community. 
Besides, clearly UCSD st udents 
constituted the majority of the 
mob. 

Fundamentally, then, it was 
a lack of individuality on the 
part of most of the people at the 
event that necessitated its being 
stopped early. Our actions 
constituted a danger to our-
selves. 

The periphery issues that the 
event brought to light are of 
more significance. 

Clearly the popularity of the 
event pointed to the need for a 
programming facility that is 
adequate to the demands of a 
growing campus, a campus 

growing in number, but hope-
fully also in its vitality. 

When an amphitheater was 
proposed several years back, 
and passed the necessary en-
vironmental safety and health 
requirements, the necessary 
sound requirements, and fund-
ing looked as if it would be 
possible, the administrators 
(i .e., Chancellor Atkinson and 
the vice chancellors) rejected 
the proposal. 

Why? The reasoning that the 
administrators offered was that 
such an amphitheater "was not 
conducive to the mission of the 
campus as an academic institu-
tion." They fail to realize that 
this is not an academic insti-
tution, but a university. 

This campus is supposed to 
provide the opportunity for the 
exchange of ideas and that ex-
change must also come outside 
of the classroom. It must come 
at TO's, at concerts, at the 
theater, and at festivals. We 

need a facility adequate for a 
safe exchange of ideas that come 
out of these kinds of events. 

The second peripheral issue 
is that the concert Friday night 
may be indicative of a new kind 
of student on this campus; a 
student that is the nightmare of 
the administrators that created 
him/ her; a student who is tired 
of the ever regressing stagnancy 
on this campus and is willing to 
take a stand. 

After a while on Friday night 
it seemed as if people were 
more interested in adding to 
the inertia of rebelliousness than 
they were in seeing the "show 
go on." Perhaps, the revolution 
against apathy has begun. 

The show must go on, but 
with the same kind of energy 
exemplified at tpe Untouchables 
concert. The excitement that 
was generated must not stop, 
but it should not have to stop 
events, either. 

The administration will react. 
They may try to stop all night 
time events. TG's are in a more 
precarious position than ever. 
The festivals might be turned 
into vastly smaller shows. These 
are the threats 1 am hearing. 

It is time to take a stand, but 
to stand responsibly, to stand 
with dignity and maturity. We 
must protect the social life on 
this campus, provide an atmos-
phere for it to grow and flour-
ish. It is, after all, e.ssential to our 
education as human beings. 

Judaken, elected last spring, 
was responsiblefor the produc-
tion of last Friday's concert.

'I Waited 
Two Hours' 
Editor: 

I am a sophomore at Warren 
College and like many other 
students at UCSD, I had planned 
my Friday night around the cam-
pus B.G. I.F ., at which the 
Untouchables were supposed to 
perform. Because I believe my 
feelings reflect many ofthose who 
attended the concert, I am en-
closing some thoughts regarding 
the event. 

I must first commend UCSD 
for scheduling such a well-known 
and well-regarded band as the 
Untouchables; however, was not 
the popularity of this band taken 
into account when planning the 
location and organization of this 
concert? 

I agree that the student body 
became out of control in some 
instances, but the reality of the 
situation is that there were too 
many people enclosed ill too little 
an area. I've enjoyed many of 
UCSD's events in the past, but in 
this case] was disappointed at the 
poor planning of the B.G.l.F. and 
also angry that 1 spent two hours 
waiting for the band to play. I just 
hope that in the future more 
consideration is taken in the 
arrangement of campus events 
such as this .

RACISM: 
Questioned 
By Torres

Fraternity and sorority repre-

diversity of their systems even 
though they are predominantly 
whites. 

All campus groups "vye for 
power" with resulting racial ten-
sions, said Gary Hobart, a repre-
sentative from the UCLA Inter-

called for implementation of eth-
nic/ gender studies requirements, 
and the creation of a multi-cultural

"I think it's not a question of

their decision not -to make the 
campus social until the time was 
right. 

They don't believe the amphi-
theater is conducive to the educa-

He suggested that students 
stress the amphitheater to the 
administration as a top priority. 
"The Events Center, including an

said Assemblyman Tom Hayden. 
"There isn't a big enough pool. 
Do we change the rules, or admit 
that we have a problem' and no

"As I look to the 21st century,

"The white majority will become

Although the event was deemed 
completely out of control by most 
in attendance, ludaken reassured 
the A.S. that T.G.s will continue. 

However, most large scale

High Field with stepped-up secur-
ity measures. 

In other matters, the A.S. allo-
cated $750 for the printing of 
5,000 copies of the Employee 
Relations Brochure. 
The brochure outlines the rights 
of student University employees 
and defines the terms of sexual 
harassment. Additionally, the 
brochure presents safety stand-
ards for student lab workers. 

On a disturbing note, Royal

Aiding Efforts to Explore the Final Frontier 

Society Promotes Galactic Endeavors 
By CYNTHIA CHESY 
Staff Writer 

With the recent space shuttle 
launching and Mars passing close 
to the earth, the public is turning 
its eyes again to space. 

The National Space Society, 
which has a local chapter with 
close to 100 active members, is 
concerned with the United States 
space program. 

One Society member, Suzanne 
Morse, got involved in the or-
ganization when she saw space 
exploration as an important 
contributor to improvements in 
communication systems, medical 
research, and scientific studies. 
"I was suddently jolted into the 
realization of how serious our 
space program is when the 
Challenger disintegrated before 
my eyes," Morse said . 

She has met with and lobbied 
Congressmen Ron Packard and 
Bill Lowery for support toward 
private enterprise within the 
space program. She was also 
attended astronomical expedi-
tions. 

In an effort to spark enthusi-
asm for the space program in 
children, Morse gives presenta-
tions in elementary school class-
rooms. She wears a flight suit she 
bought for a session at the U.S . 
Space Academy. 

At one of these presentations, 
a young surfer asked her, "If we 
brought the moon closer to earth 
would the waves be bigger?" 

A third-grade girl became very 
indignant when she was told there 
are no women commanders on 
the space shuttle. She announced, 
" I will show the'm!n 

She is bombarded with other 
questions: "Does Mars have life?" 
"How does the shuttle go up?" 
"How can I be an 'astronaut?" 
"Will Mars ever collide with 
Earth?" 
• 

Rubes® 

For adults curinus about space, 
there is a one-week space pro-
gram in which participants exper-
ience being weightless in the 
orbiter cabin ofthe space shuttle, 
see what it would be like to walk 
on the moon, and perform two

A serious head injury occurred at the

there was a concussion at the Russian 
percussion discussion. 

Reagan S Policy Discussed 
at Faculty Seminar 
By VINCENT ANDRADE 
Staff Writer 

Editorofthe San Diego Union 
Gerald L. Warren recently dis-
cussed the results of Reagan's 
"incoherent" foreign policy, as 
opposed to the intentionally 
"mystifying" policies of Ex-Presi-
dent Nixon. Warren served as 
Press Secretary for Nixon. 

This discussion, held at the 
Muir College North Dining 
Room, was the first ofthe UCSD 
Faculty Seminars on Internation-
al Security. 

Warren was chosen to speak 
for the first Seminar entitled, "A 
Reflection of Reagan's Impact 
on Foreign Policy." His speech 
provided insightful commentary 
from the right-wing on the un-
focused nature of Reagan's for-
eign policy which, Warren said, 
"has been decided on an ad hoc 
basis .. . lacking both a clear pol-
icy in the Middle East and in th 
Persian Gulf." 

Comparing Nixon as a presi-
dent who was "intimately in-
volved in all foreign policy issues" 
of his administration, Warren 

described Reagan as a president 
lacking any "depth or vision." 
For example, the reason the 
Iran-contra scandal was such a 
disaster, he stated, was because 
the President had ' not "under-
stood what was going on and the 
implications of that policy." 

The perspective Warren gave 
did not do much, however, to 
delve into the inexplicable nature 
of Reagan's success in the eyes of 
the American public, (despite an 
an incoherent foreign policy 
grounded not in a Machiavellian 
foresight but in an unfocused ad 
hocry.) 

The final part of the seminar 
served to encourage discussion 
on timely and current issues. In 
general the atmosphere, congen-
ial and largely uncritical, did not 
reflect the importance of the 
issues. Still, simply listening and 
observing the discussion served 
to inform and encourage more 
thought on current political is-
sues. 

The location ofthis University 
in the larger international dia-
logue of political issues is both 
crucial and salient . The diverse 
perspective and disciplines it 
has at its dispo al in determining 

and defining the historical, social, 
and economic forces at work 
encourages a forum where legit-
imate research and opinion can 
be both presented and discussed. 

• The UCSD Fa'culty Seminar 
on International Security offers 
just such a forum. Supported by 
grants from, among others, The 
Institute on Global Conflict and 
Cooperation, the seminar is a 
medium for gentlemen of busi-
ness and academia to interact 
and discuss political issues in-
volving immeasurable numbers 
of lives and individuals in a 
rational, disinterested manner. 

While the seminar on Reagan" 
Foreign Policy was superficial 
and anecdotal, the upcoming 
seminar on October 14 with guest 
speaker Chalmers Johnson, a 
leading authority on Japan in 
particular and Asian politics in 
general, promises to be a fulfilling 
seminar on "The Democratiza-
tion of South Korea: What Role 
Does Economic Development 
Play?" All luncheon seminars 
are held at 12 noon in the North 
Dining Room, Muir College. 

Re ervations are limited to 75 
people and can be made by calling 
Barbara Frost at 534-3352.

Congratulations to our first Team-of-the-Week,Spilce Or 
Swllllow. These girls, led by the dominant serving of Jill 
"Ace" Kawazoye and the powerful spiking of Arnie "Eat 
This" Nguyen, held off the pesky Argotles Think Dig to 
win the match 3-0. 

Winning, however, is only one way of earning the 
prestigious Team-of-the-Week honor. Teams who lose 
big, teams with the "best" uniforms, teams who are having 
the most fun, etc., all have a shot at one day capturing the 
title "Team-of-the-Week." Rumor even has it that buying 
beer for the Bud Man will work on occasion. So good luck 
to everybody and hope to see you all out there. 

Once again, way to go, Spike or Swallow. THIS

Tritons Pulverize Redlands in Womenl' Soccer 

UCSD has Outscored its Opponents 52-4 This Season 
By BRIAN !TOW 
Staff Writer 

Monday afternoon's game be-
tween the third-ranked UCSD 
Tritons and the winless University 
of Redlands showed just how big 
a difference there is between the 
best and worst women's soccer 
teams in Division III. Let's take a 
look at the numbers: 

Eleven and zero. That's the 
number of wins UCSD and Red-
lands have, respectively. UCSD is 
undefeated at 11-0-1. The U niver-
sity of Redlands is 0-4. 

Eleven to zero. That was also 
the final score of this mismatch, 
as the Tritons scored six first half 
goals en route to an easy 11-0 
victory. It was UCSD's tenth 
shutout in 12 games this year. 

Fifty and zero . That's the 
number of shots UCSD and 
Redlands had, respectively . 
UCSD controlled the game from 
its outset and dominated Red-
lands' side of the field, taking 

Commentary_ 

shots virtually at will. 
So . .. now you can see what a 

laugher this game actually was. It 
was such a laugher, in fact, that 
the Redlands players were laugh-
ing all through the second half. 

"This was a training exercise 
for us," UCSD coach Brian Mc-
Manus said. "We were just trying 
to avoid injuries, and we also had 
to try to keep away from bad hab-
its; that's all we could have worked 
on in this game: bad habits." 

And a whole lot of shooting 
practice. The Tritons connected 
on II of their 50 shots, with Kalyn 
Shea scoring four goals to lead 
the victory parade. Katy Dulock 
continues to score on a game-by-
game basis, as she added two 
goals and two assists. 

According to McManus, the 
Tritons' season is basically split 
into two mini-circuits. With the 
victory over Redlands, the Trit-
ons tour of Division III teams is 
nearing an end. They wind up 
playing Pomona-Pitzer on Fri-

day before beginning a difficult 
test against Division I and II 
teams. 

"It's hard for us to play teams 
like the University of Redlands 
and stay ready for the tougher 
teams," Felicia Faro said, who 
added two assists in Monday's 
romp. "We have to continue to 
play together and play well." 

Throughout the game, McMa-
nus was worried that his team 
might slack off. He wanted to 
make sure that his team didn't fall 
into any bad habits that would 
carry along for the next few games. 

According to the Redlands 
coach, that didn't happen. "UCSD 
is definitely a superior team. It 
executed things perfectly, and is 
going to be a tough team to beat 
all the way through the playoffs," 
she pointed out. 

To help prepare for the Div-
ision III playoffs. UCSD will play 
a number of tough games with 
ranked Division I and II oppo-
nents. The Tritons begin with a 
match Monday against CSU 

Get off the Bandwagon 
By PHIL GRUEN 
Sports Editor 

Okay. I'll admit it. I jumped on 
the Cincinnati Reds bandwagon 
when they used to be good way 
back in 75 and 76. But I was 
about seven years old then, and I 
thought we were always supposed 
to root for the winners. Even 
then, however, the Oakland A's 
were my favorite baseball team. 

I never jumped on the A's 
bandwagon. Never. As a matter 
offact, when] was born at Kaiser 
Hospital in downtown Oakland 
in May of'69, they took me out of 
the delivery room and placed me 
on the A's bandwagon, so nobody 
would ever accuse me of jumping 
on it. 

But even that didn't seem to 
make much difference. The other 
night, I was sitting peacefully in 
my room when I heard some idiot 
make a nasty crack about the A's 
sign on my door. I suppose it 
figured that the guy was wearing a 
Dartmouth hat, but what really 
ticked me off was the automatic 
assumption that I was a fair-
weather A's fan (which ] could 
easily detect from the tone of his 
voice). 

Maybe 1 shouldn't blame the 
guy, because there's nothing I 
hate more than a fair-weather 
fan. I can't even stand some of my 
high school friends back home in 
Berkeley for suddenly showing an 
interest in the A's this summer. 
And believe me, this was not 
renewed interest. 

You see, it's one thing ~o lose 
some enthusiasm for a team that 
finished in or near the cellar of its 
division year after year (Ive been 
a frustrated Golden St. Warriors 
basketball fan for what seems like 
a century.) But it's another thing 
entirely to care less about a team 
all your life and then suddenly, 
when the team has a good year, to 
hop right onto the bandwagon. 

Some of my friends jumped on 
that A's wagon this summer, and 
even though I enjoyed going to 
games with them, I was screaming 
inside. 

But it's not just the A's band-
wagon fans that annoy me. What 
really makes me sick are the Mets 
fans. They just popped out of 
nowhere in '86, the year the Mets 
capitalized on Red Sox mistakes 
and won the World Series. 

Now they're all over the place, 
including this campus. If you 
happen to see somebody wearing 
Mets apparel, don't automatically 
assume the person is a bandwagon 
fan - maybe he / she is from New 
York (the chances are minimal 
considering the fact that about 
10% of the students at UCSD are 
from out of state.) Rather, calmly 
question the reason for the display 
of the Mets logo, and if the answer 
sounds fishy. order the person to 
step off the bandwagon. Immedi-
ately. 

One final thing: I'm still a 
Warriors fan , and I will never, 
ever root for the Dodgers. 

Get off the bandwagon, sucker.

Sheila Takahashi, who scored 
one of the Triton's II goals in her 
first game back from an injury, 
felt that the Redlands game will, 
in fact, help them during the 
second half of the season. 

"Even though we blew them 

out, we were able to settle down. 
We also got a number of players 
who have been out with injuries 
back into the lineup, so this was a 
good start for the second half of 
the season." 

Friday, the Tritons host Po-
mona-Pitzer at 2:30 p.m. on 
Warren Field. 

Junior Heather Mauro, who s';ored twice against Redlands, has been

PHIL'S PRIME PIC-'K5i

American League Playoffs 
OAKLAND VS. BOSTON 

PHIL'S ANALYSIS ... tht; A's won the season 
series against Boston 9-3, but the Red Sox have a 
history of banging the A's around in Fenway, and they 
beat them three out of four in that crazy park the last 
time these two teams met back in August. Still, the 
power trio of Canseco, McGwire, and Henderson (not 
to mention Parker, Lansford and Steinbach) should 
overpower the excellent but recently sputtering Bos-
ton pitching staff in the long run. An added bonus is 
that the A's have Don Baylor this year, and he has 
played for two consecutive World Series teams. The 
still young seven-game playoff format leaves the A's 
room for mistake, so I'm going to say it's gonna be 
Oakland in six. I1l admit that being an A's fan may 
have something to do with it; but PHIL stiJI recom-
mends that you .. .

A rmed with their ~ new 
album Tndh aad SoaI, Rshbone Is out to 
break down bant4m5 In the music world and In 
the minds of the nsteners. 

And along the way. Rshbone refuses to slow 
down or nei&lect the asset which has made one 
of the most talked-about live acts around: an 
Inaedlbly high IewI of raw eneqzy. 

At Saturday's concert In the EI Cortez BaDroom In downtown San Diego, Rshbone not only satlsfted Its fans with a 
trademark outrageous show. It also made sodaJ statements which had a dear Impact on the aowd. 

A spoken-word performance of "Slow Bus Mavin' (Howard Beach Party)," a song about the horrible Brooklyn racial 
Inctdent, and the acoustic ballad "Change." which they dosed the show with. made the aowd stop danctng and nsten 
to the message of the songs. 

For most bands, to end a IIQhtntng-paced show with a baDad would leave a sense of ambiguity. Its testament to 
Flshbone's mess. that "Change" flt perfectly. The aowd had as much fun as at any Rshbone concert in the past, and 
the band's soclal statements reJlstered as wd 

The concert, put on by Reggae Makosa ·and M Productions, also featured rapper Schooly D. and ska acts auclal DBC 
and Donkey Show. Donkey Show was ~ strong, with great sound and muslclanshlp as well as an entertaining 
stage show. 

But with Rshbone's appearance on staQe. It became dearly cvtdent who the evening belonged to. No one could pos-
sibly have more stage presence than lead vocalist Angelo Moore. WIth Moore leadlng the way. the band and the aowd 
exhan8ed, a sort ofldnetlc eneqzy that kept on buIJdIna. Moore was wartna an elbow brace and seemed to be taking 
care of his elbow at ftrst. but It wasn't 10118 before he was dlvtng Into the aowd. 

Whlle Rshbone Is unquestionably best as a live band, TftdIa aacI SoaI comes closer to the power of their lives shows 
than either their debut EP Party at GrocauI Zero or the 1986 album Ia YOUI' Pace. The album Is stronger In that it is 
much more focused. with a central message. 

The mess. Isn't preachy but Is still powerfUL It's evident rtaht fiom the start. even though the ftrst song Isn't an 
original. The album opens with a forceftd cover of Curtis Mayfteld's classtc anti-drug sonQ "Freddie's Dead."

Malashock's dance: 
beautifully equal 

by laura baker 
hiatul intern 

My friend and 1 arrive five min-
utes late. Space is always a pre-
mium at the intimate Sushi 
Gallery, and the seats have filled 
quickly for the performance of 
the newly formed troupe Mala-
shock Dance and Company. 

In fact, our seats have been 
given away. We end up on the 
floor, which I now consider the 
best seat in the house. There, on 
the edge of the dance mat, undis-
tracted by the immobile bodies of 
the audience, I became submerged 
in John Malashock's beautiful, 

world 

duets. 
I found it particularly interest-

ing that not all of these intense, 
intimate pieces were performed 
with Malashock, but between the 
women as well, emphasizing the 
strength and individuality of the 
three female dancers in the com-
pany: Kate Lounsbury, Debi Toch 
and Maj Xander. They serve not 
as showpieces for Malashock, but 
as his equals. 

"That's a development I feel 
really good about," says Mala-
shock. " In a way it's fairly recent, 
feeling like each of them really 

does have their own position 
there. When I'm dancing with 
them it's very much on an equal 
footing. " 

If this first performance is any 
indication of things to come, then 
Malashock has much to offer San 
Diego as a talented dancer and as a 
maturing choreographer. Starting 
a dance troupe here is an ambi· 
tious gamble. Although San Diego 
is the home of such remarkable 
troupes as Three's Company and 
the California Ballet, audience 
support for these local groups is 
weak. But other performing arts 
have a stronger foundation here, 
making Malashock optimistic 
about his own chances of success. 

"I certainly have hopes from 
what I've seen of people support-
ing theatre in this town that there 
are enough people here that really

The San Francisco Ballet opens 

the 1989 San Diego Performan· 
ces' Ultimate Dance Season with 
the highly acclaimed full·length 
production of Swan Lake. Three 
performances running Oct. 6-8 
will offer romantic sets and cos-
tumes by Jens-Jacob Worsaae and 
lighting by David K.H. Elliott. 
The San Diego Symphony Orch-
estra will be conducted by San 
Francisco Ballet's Music Director 
and Conductor, Maestro Denis de 
Coteau. 

Swan Lake represents the fairy-
tale love story of a prince, Sieg-
fried, and his love for a woman, 
Odette, who has fallen under the 
spell of the evil magician Von 
Rothbart. Except between mid-
night and dawn, Odette is cursed 
to take the form of a swan. The 
dual female role of Odette/ Odile 
(traditionally known as the White 
Swan and Black Swan) is one of San Francisco Ballet principal dancers Ludmila Lepulchoua and Da~id

Fishbone speaks the Soul Truth 

Shocked into success 
by patty jettie 

hiatul writer 

With her short spiky hair and 
waif-like presence, you would 
expect her to start belting out an 
old Sex Pistols tune. Yet Michelle 
Shocked's work merges two rare 
traits, political conscience and lyr-
ical witticism, to produce truly 
fantastic folk music. 

Her recently released album, 
"Short Sharp Shocked," is a 
complex blend of pop and coun-

try blu('s. There are a couple of 
great folk tunes, some shear 
"rock" songs, and a melodic bal-
lad which incorporates a delicate, 
lilting string line. Perhaps Mi-
chelle's best chance at Top 40 
popularity is "Anchorage," a song 
with a solid beat underlined with a 
feminist message. 

An unusual musician, her past 
reads like a fairy tale gone hay-
wire. When her parents divorced,

"It fits society right now," said 

guitarist Kendall Jones in an inter-
view before the show. "It's the 
first non-preaching anti-drug song. 
It's more of a commentary on 
what happens as opposed to say-
ing 'Don't do it.' Just here's the 
end result : Freddie's dead." 

The rest of the songs on the 
album, all written by the band, are 
no less powerful. 

"Ma and p~." a song about the 
effect of divorce on a child, is a 
particularly pointed song: "Well, 
there's lots of money for all the 
attorneys. It's just not a fight for 
child custody, cause Ma and Pa's 
revenge is maldng little sister bleed. 
Fussin' and fightin' through a fam-
ily life make her wanna take drugs 
and be out of line," said Jones. 

While the songs are mostly 
commentary on the ills of society, 
there is a unifying strand of hope, 
especially evident in " Question of 
Life" and " Pouring Rain." They 
reflect the basic faith of the band. 

"Believe it or not, I am a Chris-
tian," Jones said. "I don't believe 
in religion, because that's not 
truth . I believe in truth, faith . 
People like Jerry Falwell preach 
hatred, you know, saying 'I'll teach 
you the teachings of Christ,' but at 
the same time (saying) 'I'm going 
to bomb the communists; I'd 
rather be dead than red.' Instead 
of telling the truth, they're talking 
about political slogans and stuff 
like that. 

"It's like during World War II, 
when Ethiopians were being

bombed by Italian bombs blessed 
by the pope. And the Crusades. 
All these falsehoods. No wonder 
so many people don't understand 

ter 
They have been together for ten 

years, starting out while the six 
were in junior high school together 
in the south-central part of west 
Lost Angeles. 

Over those ten years, the band's 
musical style has developed to the 
extent that they defy categoriza-
tion. Which is exactly how the 
band likes it. 

"We're always going to do what 
we do: what we want todo," Jones 
said. "And so if somebody tries to 
pigeonhole us into anyone cate-
gory 'Oh, they're a funk band,' or 
'They're this hardcore band,' or 
whatever, they're obviously speak-
ing with ignorance because they 
really don't know what we're 
about." 

"You know, people shouldn't 
worry about it," Fish added. 
"They should just listen to it. It's 
music. Don't listen for it to be 

some ska, some reggae, some funk, 
you know, all these subcultures 
and all that ... just listen to it as 
music ." 

If there's anything more nota-
ble than the lyrics on Truth and 
Soul, ie's the music on the album. 
With songs ranging in style from 
sica to hard-rock to reggae to folk, 
all presented with an amazing focus 
and cohesiveness, the album stands 
out as superior. 

And Fishbone hasn't lost its 
touch for comically suggestive 
songs, as evidenced by "Bonin' in 
the Boneyard," a throwback to 
the risque humor of the hits 
"Ugly," "Parry at Ground Zero," 
and "Cholly." 

The band's musical goals are 
challenging and honorable. "I just 
want to have more control at the 
record label and in the music 
industry," said Fish, "so I can pull 
up more bands that are just into 
music for the sake of music, not 
for the sake of just making some 
money and jumping on whatever 
is playing in the discos or whatever." 

Jones agreed. "We want to 
break the world open for newer 
music. Not that what we do is that 
new, but presenting it in the form 
that we do and the way we per-
form it, I consider it pretty new 
and I'd like to break down doors 
by doing it by our own rules and 
haVing a triple-platinum record, 
so people can follow our exampk 
and find out that you don't have 
to be George Michael to get 
ahead." 

No, Fishbone is getting ahead 
on its own terms. And knocking 
down barriers as it goes.

George has tFaith' in himself 
by donovan p. roche 

hia" .. write .. 

A shroud of blackness covers the stage. Momentary silence fills the air. Suddenly frenetic applause 
as the curtain raises to release a wave of dense fog over the audience. A giant cage surrounding nine 
people slowly becomes visible. As the cage opens, UGHTS!, and George Michael and his eight-piece 
band dive into the pumped up "I Want Your Sex." . 

This is more than likely how Michael will open hisshowon Tuesday, Oct. 11 atthe Sports Arena; 
but as the artist himself has stated, "The show is constantly evolving." 

Michael began the 45-date American leg of his Faith world tour in Landover, Maryland, where he 
told his predominantly female audience, "Please don't expect to see hundreds of dancers with me, and 
don't expect me to disappear and reappear. Because all you're going to get for the next two hours is ... 
... me 

This is an understatement of sorts considering that Michael's concerts have been designed by the 
same production team responsible for the Pink Aoyd and Michael Jackson extravaganzas. This 
means, among other things, some pretty impressive laser graphics. 

Michael's treasure chest selections of uptown funk and sultry ballads are sure to please a diversified 
audience. One can naturally assume that he will play most of his quintuple-platinum Faith album, but 
he has no intention of stopping there. He has also been performing Wham hits like "Careless 
Whisper," and "I'm Your Man," as well 85 70s soul classics, "Lady Marmalade" and Wild Cherry's 
perfectly appropriate "Play That Funky Music (White Boy)." . 

Twenty-five year-old Michael is proud of his pop star status and isn't ashamed to speak openly, as 
he did last January in a Rolling Stone interview. "In a sense, I think what I'm really aiming for is to 
become a star of a different proportion," George said. "People like Madonna and Springsteen and 
Prince - I've got to get into the league to satisfy me that my music is getting as far as it should." 
After 40 weeks, Faith is still holding the twelfth position on Rolling Stone's Top 50. 

Like Prince, Michael set out to do things his way. Not only did he wnte, arrange and produce Faith, 
but he also played all of the instrument son "I Want Your Sex" and "Hard Day" and either 
keyboards, bass, or the drums on the rest of the'album. From the very beginning, Michael took full 
responsibility for his solo debut. And if nothing else he discovered there's somethinr~ to be said for 
omnipotent creative control. You just gotta have faith!

Shabalala frees 
African music 

by jeff beresford.howe 
opinion editor 

W ho's on your list of the greatest singers in the 
world? Aretha Frank-

lin? Placido Domingo? Dianne 
Schur? Bernice Reagan? Biork 
Gudmundsdottir ; that woman 
who wails for the Sugarcubes, cal-
ling forth the ghost of janis Joplin? 

Notice anything about that list, 
or, probably, your list? It 's Euro-
pean and American. 

Paul Simon went to South 
Africa three years ago looking for 
d ifferent, non -Western sounds. 

Shabalala is the songwriter and 
lead singer of the vocal choir. 
Ladysmith Black Mombazo. 
" Ladysmith" from the South 
African township from which 
they come, " Mombazo" from 
the Zulu word for freedom . 

On the heelaoftheir new album, 
the group played'l-iumphrey's in 
San Diego last week and demon-
strated that Shabalala has about as 
good a voice as you can find any-
where in "pop music." That 
Ladysmith Black Mombazo is even 

$ so 

considered pop mulic i~a tribute 
to Simon, who first exposed the 
group on his spectacular Gracp-
land album and tour. (LMB is 
responsible for "Homeless, II that 
album's most spectacular track). 

On both their new record and 
on stage, Shabalala sings tribal and 
personal compositions. The group 
performs with exuberance, humor 
and clarity wonderful to anyone, 
whether or not the audience 
understands Zulu. 

Shabalala is innocent but not 
naive; his celebration of family 
and of the choir 's jealousy of the 
wives left behind mixes with 
lamentations for migrant mine 
workers: "Christmas is gone. and 
it will be a whole year before it 
comes again. We only see our 
loved ones once a year, II he sings. 
He damns past laws and pleads 
for happiness. not jealousy at his 
group's unexpected success. 

Shabalala gave what is probably 
the finest vocal performance of 
the year in San Diego; his new 
album is beautifully produced and 
does complete and total justice to 
his voice and vision.

Jeannie Cheatham, the current

first in the UCSD Music Depart-
ment's Wednesday Eveninjls at

Cheatham is reputed to be one 
of the most authentic blues vocal-

to Leo nard Feather, she "plays 
down-the-middle piano and sings 
down-the-decades blues." 

Cheatham was also featured

.S Art with 
energy 

by jim "ray 
hiatul writer 

"Bagus Indonesia," an exhibit now on dis-
play at the Grove Gallery, instills in everyone 
who sees it fascination for the artistic trad i-
tio ns of the varied Indonesian cultures. 

A surreal flying frog, an intricately carved 
wooden door, and a basket made of seaweed 
are only a few of the attractions. 

The carved wooden "Garudas" dominate 
the show. Hindu mythology maintains that 
Garuda is the creature o n whose back rides the 
god Rama . (For this reason, the national air-
line of Indonesia is called "Garuda Airways. ") 
The two sculptures included in the show are 
six feet tall and ornately detailed. 

They are painted in bright colors and deco-
rated with gold leaf, and feature detachable 

hand~ and wings. They are of exquisite 
craftsmanship and evoke both an aboriginal 
energy and a spirit of Oriental refinement and 
precision. The pose and energy of the pieces 
have a dynamic, tense energy which contrasts 
sharply with the formal stiffness of the West-
ern woodcarving tradition.

Does the thought of Captain 
Ahab and Moby Dick playing a 
whale-sized game of tag make you 
seasick? Or at the utterance of 
Charles Dickens' name does your 
underwear spontaneously bunch 
up? If so, then you are probably 
well-acquainted with the profes-
sionals of McLiterature known as 
Cliff Notes. 

No need to feel humbled , 
though, because Gina and Annette 
Cascone are two very sympathetic 
authors who have assigned them-
selves the duty of parodying not 
only ~liff Notes but the Classics 

o H 

and their creators as well . 
In their book, cleverly entitled 

Jump Off the Cliff Nares, the Cos-
cones relentlessly attack the works 
and lives of Ernest Hemingway, 
Nathaniel Hawthorne, and John 
Steinbeck, just to name a few. 
Their approach is sometimes 
sophomoric and usually irrever-
ant, but they do succeed in bring-
ing a sardonic spot of humor to 
the stuffiness that often accom-
panies brilliant works of writing. 

For example, they redefine the 
moral of Moby Dick as "Never 
screw around with a big Dick," 
while also maintaining that Na-
thaniel Hawthorne preferred 
Herman Melville to call him 

"Peaches" when they were alone. 
As if this were not enough to 

keep you in stitches, the Coscones 
have structured their book along 
the lines of Cliff Notes. They dili-
gently include pop quizzes, review 
questions, and who-said-what sec-
tions that are abundant with sar-
castic quips and one-liners. 

In one such quiz the authors test 
the readers' knowledge of quota-
tions by challenging them to iden-
tify the famous character who 
utters: 'I wasn 't doin' nothin' bad 
with it, George, I was only strokin' 
it.' Luckily it is multiple choice, 
with the correct answer being 
either Martha Washington upon 
her husband's return from Valley 
Forge, Ronald Reagan to George 
Bush, or Lenny in Of Mice and 
Men. 

The authors also succeed in 
catching the reader's eye by deco-
rating their book in the traditional 
yellow and black that everyone 
finds so attractive in the original 
Cliff Notes. 

As a bonus, the Coscones 
include sections sure to please

Shocked 
Continued from pale 4 
Michelle's mother, a dominating, 
fundamentalist woman, married a 
soldier and shuffled the family 
from base to base . After traveling 
both in and out of the United 
States, Mi chelle eventually 
returned to her home state, Texas. 
Because she was never allowed to 
remain in one place, Michelle 
began to turn away from school 
peers and, in her own words, 
became " ... just kind of the 
introspective bookworm. 1 was 
one of those kids who read a lot, 
wrote poetry, took herself too 
seriously. Now imagine being an 
army brat traveling around, new 
kids, new schools all the time. 
And the kids would always go, 
'Hey you! Are you a boy or a girl?' 
Finally I just really let it get to me. 
I stopped having an identity at all. 
I got more and more introverted, 
more and more angry." 

Yet Michelle's summer visits 
with her father allowed her to 
escape to a bett~r world . A 
romantic post-hippie, he took her 
to bluegrass festivals and advo-
cated her playing the guitar. Fi -
nally, at age 16, Michelle ran away 
from her mother, moved in with 

her father , and attended school in 
Dallas. From there she entered the 
UniverSity of Texas. 

It was at this point that 
Michelle's period of homelessness 
began. Traveling west, Michelle 
followed both the blues and punk 
scene, eventually landing in San 
Francisco in 1983. Residing in 
everything from a housing co-op 
to an abandoned brewery, Mich-
elle became increasingly influenced 
by the squatter's movements and 
the politics of the homeless. After 
d rifting back to Austin, her mother 
had her c0mmitted to a psychiat-
ric hospital in Dallas. She was held 
until, after six months, the insu-
rance money ran out. Though 
Michelle kids about being com-
mitted (along ,with three jailings 
due to political protests), the 
events have definitely left scars. 
She claims that it was during her 
jail time that she adopted the 
name "Shocked " (in regards to 
"shell shocked") and has c ut all 
ties to her mother. 

In 1985, she traveled to Ams-
terdam, determined never to 
return to America. One year later, 
however, she decided to return to 
Texas to attend the Kerrville Folk 
Festival one last time . "This was 
kind of my last dance with the 
music that I grew up with and 
loved, and the people who played 
it best," Michelle said. 

It was at the festival that Pete 
Lawrence, a British independent 
record entrepreneur , heard and 
recorded Michelle 's performance 

n his W alkman. Lawrence con-
tacted Michelle and proposed to 
press the recording onto vinyl.

Art 
Continued from pap 7 

Hanging on the walls is an 
assortment of masks and puppets 
in a variety of styles and materials . 
These masks are from a range of 
Indonesian cultures and are uni-
fied not so much by their crafts-
manship as by their compelling 
expressions. 

Each one is a portrait of some 
being. Whether mythological in 
reference or a portra1t of a specific 
individual, each summons to mind 
a specific mood or emotion. 

There are also a large number of 
items of everyday use on display, 
such as a coconut scraper, a bird-
cage, a wooden backpack to put a 
baby in, and smaller items such as 
pillboxes and jewelry. 

The combined influences of 
aboriginal and Oriental cultures 
on Indonesian culture is fascinat-
ing. A wide variety of Indonesian 
cultures are represented in the col-
lection of everyday objects, more 
so than in the rest of the exhibit. 

Many more intriguing, myste-
rious and beautiful items are on 

display. Massive bronze cowbells, 
articulated puppets, and a bizarre, 
helmet-like dance mask of the 
Topeng culture are only a few of 
the objects to hold one's attention. 

The exhibit is on loan from the 
collection of Leslie Ann Martin of 
Vista. Ms. Martin was born and 
raised in Wewak, Papua New 
Guinea, and has imported art from 
New Guinea and Indonesia since 
1984. "Indonesian artisans can-
not maintain the feeling of a 
second-rate standard,'" she said. 
"Whether a craftsman makes a 
piece for ceremonial use or for 
sale, he puts the same amount of 
work into it." 

This Indonesian standard of 
universal quality is reflected in the 
exhibit. A carved door from 
Timor, a Muslim/personality-cult 
society, reflects the same involved 
workmanship as the glided Bali-
nese monkey mask, commissioned 
by Ms. Martin, on display. 

The exhibit runs through Oct. 
22. Gallery hours are Tuesday 
through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., 
and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 
p.m. Parking is free on the week-
ends. For more information, call

On the whole, the book offers a 
fair amount of chuckles for one 
who hates Cliff Notes, reading, or 
both. Fortunately, one has to have 
read only some of the books par-
odied in order to get the jokes, 
which makes Jump Off the Cliff

Ballet 
Continued from pale 3 
the most distinguished of any bal, 
lerina's career. 

One of the most legendary of 
full,length ballets, Swan Lake first 
entered thf' San Francisco ballet's 
repertoire in 1940 when Willam 
Christensen created the first com, 
plete American production of this 
work. Helgi Tomasson's produc, 
tion marks San Francisco Ballet's 
second complete version of this 
classic. Following its April 1988 
premiere, Anna Kisselgoff of the 
New York Times stated that Tom, 
asson's production "puts San 
Francisco Ballet on the interna, 

.tional dance map." 
While the framework of Tom, 

asson's Swan Lake was influenced 
by the Petipa/ lvanov production 
presented in Russia in 1895, 
Tomasson has created his own 
choreography and staging for the 
first and third acts. The third and 
fourth acts have also been recon, 
ceived with the final intermission 
deleted and a new piece of music, 
Tchaikovsky's Serenade Melanco-
lique, op.26, inserted. 

In staging the second act of 
Swan Lake, T omasson was assisted 
by Irina Jakobson, a member of 
San Francisco Ballet School's 
faculty and a former soloist with 
Leningrad's Kirov Ballet, who 
coached San Francisco Ballet 
dancers in the Russian style of the 
Vaganova School.

Jazz

of music at UCSD. He teaches 
improvisation and Black Music 
History, and is the director of the 
jazz program. The couple performs 
together at weddings, parties and 
store openings. Jimmy's goal is to 
stay uncommitted, spontaneous. 
Jeannie's goal is to play jazz around 
the world, in Paris, London and 
Japan. 

She and the Sweet Baby Blues 
have, in fact, just returned from a 
triumphant East Coast tour of 
nightclubs in Philadelphia, and 
New York City, and jazz festivals 
in New Jersey and Rochester, New 
York. 

Jeannie Cheatham's generous 
performances are always filled with 
joy and universal appeal. In her 
own words, "Jazz is like a family," 
and "Someplace, somewhere, 
somebody needs a good band." 

Shocked 
Continued from pale 10 
She agreed and The Texas Camp-
fire Tapes became a British hit. 
"I wrote him: sure, go ahead, good 
luck ... and dropkick me if it 
didn't go to the very top of the 
Independent Album Charts the 
next month. Which really to me 
says something about people's 
sense of humor, seeing as how the 
damn thing's got crickets chirping 
like mad the whole way through 
and Joe Don's pickup truck mak, 
ing godawful grinding noises with 
the gears in the background." 

After that, it was only a matter 
of time before the major labels 
became interested. Michelle even, 
tually signed with PolyGram, with 
the understanding that she would 
retain complete artistic control. 
With the August release of Short 
Sharp Shocked and her current 
tour with folk~singer Billy Bragg, 
Michelle is on her way to joining 
the distinguished ranks of such 
artists as Sinead O'Connor and 
Tracy Chapman.
