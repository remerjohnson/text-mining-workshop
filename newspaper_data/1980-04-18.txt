First Aid Questioned in Donn Death 
P~lice Say Moving Howard Was Justified Because Hospital So Near 

BY PETER MORTENSEN 
Although police homicide officials 

are callintr the death of Revelle I 
frnhman Alan Howard "accidental," 
the April 9 incident has stirred 
controversy as students in Howard's 
dormitory question the quality of first 
aid service he received from a team of 
campus police ambulance attendants. 

Howard reportedly collapsed while 
inhaling nitrous oxide with two friends 
in his dormitory suite. After about two 
houn of CPR and other life.restoring 
techniques failed to revive him, 
Howard was pronounced dead by 
p~ysicians at Scripps · Memorial 
H ·tal. ~re is a basic difference in 
opinion on first aid technique," said 
Mark Kramer, resident assistant for 
Howard's GaIathea dormitory. He 
explained that the problem centers 
around the belief held by him and 
others that a patient should be 
stabilized before transportation - a 
service only paramedics can oHer. 

Campus police practice the policy of 
hating their trained medical 
technicians rush a patient to 
professional care at the soonest 
pouible moment. 

Kramer sites handting of Howard as 
an example of poor judgement by 
police attendants, as Howard was 
carried down the steep dorm stairs 

while CPR was being administered, 
causing the crucial pumping rhythum 
to be interrupted. 

Kramer stressed that there is no 
hostility between his group and campus 
police, and that he and several others 
will speak to campus chief of police 
Hugh French about the situation on 
Monday or Tuesday. 

"We just want to dear up the 
ambiguities here so there can be better 
medical service on campus," he said. 

A spokesman for the UC Police 
Department disagreed with .the 
philosophy of the students, sayIng, 
"We save time due to our proximity to 
Scripps (Hospital) wh«:n there ~ould 
easily be a 20-30 minute watt for 
paramedics. It's a 
paramedic·s. It's ridiculous to wait if 
you have care like this available 10 
quickly." 

Lieutenant Uoyd Turner said that 
all of the police ambulance attendants 

~~ipated in .a rigorous Emergency 
Medical Technician course taught by 
the San Diego Police Department. He 
added that the two officers involved in 
the Howard case had just finished 
attending a SDPD emergency first aid 
refresher course. 

According to Judith Edwin, Revelle 
Resident Dean on internship leave, 
"The RAs know ,about Medivac (a 
local paramedic service)," and if they 

feel paramedic service is necessary, 
they can call them. 

However, another Revelle RA did 
call Medivac on an attempted suicide 
several days before Howard's death, 
and he was reportedly told that campus 
police would handle the situation. 

The campus investigation into 
Howard's death has been completed, 
and the case has been turned over to 
SDPD homicide for further work. 
According the SDPD Lieutenant John 
Gregory, hi department "has found 
nothing of a criminal nature against the 
two individuals (Galathea Hall 
residents)," in connection with the 
death. 

However another Revelle RA said 
Medivac was contacted in the case of 
an attempted suicide in the dorms 
several days before Howard's death. 
At that time, the caller was told that 
campus police had already been 
notified of the emenlency and the caller 
.assumed Medivac would not respond. 

Police first realized the cannisters 
were stolen from Scripps Hospital 
when another inventory at the hospital 
showed four bottlea to be missing. 

The hospital's chief engineer 
confirmed that the cannister were 
returned to him VVednesday by 
campus police. Fred Baker said that 
the fuU cannisters were di coverE'd 
miuing hortly after the Howard 

incident was reported, but that all 
cannisters were accounted for in a 
routine inventory check on Thursday, 
April 3. 

When the bottles, which measure 
about two feet in height by four inches 
in diameter, were returned, three were 
empty and the other was full. 

"Whomever stole the cannisters had 
a lot of trouble," said Baker, explaining 
that the alleged burglars had to "jump 
over the top of a gate surrounding the 
gas storage area and undo the bolts 
holding the cage covering the bottles 
down to the cement floor." 

Baker complained that ever since 
the theft of larger nitrous oxide bottles a 
few years ago, police and fire officials 
have been uncooperative in helping 
protect and secure the much sought. 
after gas. 

"All of a sudden now, they're calling 
here and are interested in this," he aid 
bitterly. hi 1 5 rrNSe tum 0 pafe

Education Too High 
A Priority for Tuition 
Editor: 

I would like to comment 
briefly on Propoaition 9, 
and ita impact on the future 
of American society. 

Fint, Mr. Jarvia statea 
that even if Prop. 9 doean't 
pall, California univeraities 
will .ti11 .,..obably have 
tuition. Thi. is not 
verifiable; nor were hi. 
atatements that with Prop. 
13 renters would receive 
rent reductiona from their 
landorda. It i. important to 
note that Mr. Jarvia ia riding 
the crest of a popular wave, 
and that he will .ay 
anything to get Prop. 9 to 
PUl, AI he would for Prop. 
13. He needs our votes and 
the votes of our relatives 
and friends to have Prop.9 
pus. 

He atates that education 
only creates welfare 
recipients. He neglects 
engineers, scientists, health 
profesaionals and business· 
men, to name a few. If 10 
percent of the Itudent 
population leaves UCSD 
beeauae tuition i.levied, we 
will auffer not only a 
ahortage of manpower in 
theae fields upon which our 
future national security , 
indUitry and the social 
security payments and 
buaineaa penaiona of our 
elder. depend, but also a 
short.,e of what i. perhaps 
the most important 
intangible education 
deliver. - knowledge of 
citizen.hip and democracv. 

which is necessary for ua, 
the leaders of the future, to 
maintain the American way 
of life. Moreover, we create 
an explosive aocial situation 
in our job market and 
society by pulling 
education out of the reach 
of lOme, or di.couragin. 
future Itudenh from 
attending. 

No student I know gets 
his education free, contrary 
to the common misconcep-
tion of the jealous people 
who favor Prop. 9. 

A reduction of the sales 
tax, or an equal tax credit 
llightly higher than the tax 
credits for the median 
income peraon rmilling 
from Prop. 9, say $150 per 
perlOn or family, would be 
lar more predictable and 
fair than paying nothing to 
the poor and thousands to 
the wealthy, which i. the 
only group Mr. Jarvis is 
really concerned about. 

We can beat Prop. 9 and 
retain the option to reduce 
taxes any way we want to, 
without being used by Mr. 
Jarvis again, if we make our 
voices known to our 
families and friends, 81 weU 
as to our representatives, 
letting them know what we 
feel. U we all vote, this wiD 
a110 help. We do not need 
any more cutbacks in 
education, 6brariea, police 
or fire depvtmenta at thit 
time. '

Safety of Microwave Ovens 
Being Ignored in Rush to Sell 
Information Doesn't Keep Up With Proliferation: 
Hazards Much More Serious Than Believed 

BY JEANNE WTI 
By the end of 1978 it waa 

estimated that the micro· 
wave industry had placed 
microwave ovens in 9 million 
American homes; by 1980, 
the indUitry expect. more 
than 16 million microwave 
ovens to be operating in 
homes acroll the nation. The 
New Kitchen Technology i. 
touted 81 being both time and 
energy.saving - and the 
microwave oven is adver· 
tised as being the most 

essential item in it. 
Unfortunately, the 

.tartling proliferation of theae 
ovens haa not been matched 
by a pr06feration of clear, 
easy·to·understand, acCelsi· 
ble information with which 
consumers can make 
informed choices about 
whether to bring microwave 
technololY into their hornes. 
The illue is .afety -=- and it is 
a highly controversial one. 

On one side i. the 
microwave industry and its 
scientists, claiming that 
microwave ovena are safer 
than conventional gaa and 
electric ranges: on the other 
.ide are independent 
researchers and scientists 
who fear that mall 
marketing of these ovens has 
dangerously pre·empted 
adequate research on a 
multitude of health hazard. 
that they claim have been 
linked to low·level micro-
wave radiation exposure. 

What are microUIGlIeI? In 
1974, Microwave Energy 
Applications Newsletter, a 
trade journal for the 
microwave industry, 
contained an editorial in 
which the author Ulailt:d a 
aa1eaperson's Ule of the word 
"radiation" in connection 
with microwave ovens. The 
term to uae, he pleaded, is 
"microwave emision," and 
he ur,ed salespeople to avoid 
aU references with frightening 

connotations. Sut, despite 
the reluctance of the indUitry 
to Ule the lenn, microwavea 
are a form of radiation. 

So What'. the Problem? 
Low·level radiation' expo· 
sure, not thermal (heat) 
burna, is the problem. While 
the illue ·of microwave 
radiation hat been and i. 
currently a conatant point of 
disC'II.ion within the 
microwave industry, that 
indUitry has made a studied 
effort to pu blicly .refer to the 

safety question, if at all, only 
euphemisticaUy\. Official 
industry allurances to 
conaumers focUi on hazard. 
associated with thermal 
burns only when these are 
not the illue. 

An examination of 
nineteen microwave oven 
advertisin, brochurea 
revealed that fourteen of 
these mention neither safety 
featurea nor safety 
considerationa; five of the 
nineteen do list safety 
features such aa interlocking 
devices and multiple door 
leals · What they don't 
mention is that these features 
are designed to protect 
again.t low· level radiation 
leakage, yet not a single 
brochure referred to either 
'1eakage" or "radiation," nor 
did any contain user caution. 
or warnings. 

But aren', there standards 
to protect us? 'The potential 
buyer (AI well a. the current 
owner) of a microwave oven 
should be aware that 
virtually all of these oven. 
leak and that .0verMlellt 
standard. permit them to do 
so. The queltion i. how much 
leakage is dangerOUI. Critic:a 
01 the current standard. (aet 
by the US Bureau of 
Raciological Health) argue 
that the impoaed limits are 
baaed on the danaerOUlly 
false allUlllption that any 
effects of low·level 

microwave radiation are 
transitory. In fact, a growing 
volume of research indicates 
that the effect of repeated 
lITlall doleS which are not 
themselves hazardous may 
be cumulative, accumulating 
with each exposure and 
eventually producing a 
frightening array of medical 
problems several years from 
now - too late for today's 
unknowing victim. 

Another criticism of the 
standards and their 

not 
protect against excessive 
leakage that might occur a. a 
result of damage to the oven 
in the home. People exposed 
to harmful levels of 
microwave radiation have no 
way of knowing it - in mo.t 
caaea there are no aenaory 
signals to warn the victim. 
. What are these health 

hazards? In 1972, the US 
Surgeon General said, "no 
injuries have been reported 
and none are known to exi.t 
from microwave ovens." In 
the past seven years, 
however, this statement hal 
been followed by other 
evidence that microwaves 
may came cataracta, and are 
strongly IUlpected of causing 
behavioral changes and 
sterility in both males and 
females. Studies in Eaatern 
Europe indicate that long 
term exposure to Iow-level 
microwave radiation may 
cauae headaches, dizzineas, 
fatigue, irritability, leukemia, 
heart trouble, cancer, central 
nervoua sy.tem disordera 
and genetic damage. 

HoUJ can consumers 
protect themselves? If you 
own a microwave oven you 
should operate it with the 
understanding that you are 
dealing with radiation. Keep 
your oven in top operating 
condition, read o.P.8'aq 
instructions thoroughly.

Stockholders Kill 
Anti-Nuke Issue 

ROSEMEAD, Calif - A 
resolution asking the Southern 
California Edison Co. to stop 
further development of its San 
Onofre and Palo Verde 
nuclear power plants and to 

. implement conservation and 
alternative energy protrams 
was defeated at Edison's 
stockholders meeting 
yesterday. 

The vote was 87 percent no 
and 5 percent yes, with 8 
percent abstaining, said 
Edison spokesman Russ 
Hawkes, who noted that 
Edison had urged stockholders 
to vote against the motion. 

The sponsor of the 
resolution was the American 
Baptist Home Million 
Society. About nine members 
of the anti· nuclear Alliance for 
Survival demonstrated outside 
Edison headquarters as the 
stockholders met. 

The two resolutions asked 
the company to "develop 
conservation and alternative 

energy programs to meet 
consumer demands for 
electricity and send a report on 
such programs to shareholders 
annually" and to "halt further 
development, planning and 
construction of the San Onofre 
and Palo Verde units until the 
dangers associated with 
nuclear operation and nuclear 
waste disposal are resolved." 

The stockholders' protest 
follows a Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission announcement 
on Wednesday that nine 
Edison workmen in protective 
clothing were contaminated 
with radiation during a repair 
operation last Saturday at the 
company's San Onofre facility 
on the coast at the Orange. 
San Diego county line. 

AU apparently escaped 
injury, the NRC said, but the 
agency will conduct an 
investigation because of the

Questions Remain in Dorm Death 
Continued ',om page 1 

Baker described the cannisters 
as "about 15 pounds each and 
light enough for a strong man to 
easily carry two." 

The cage housing nitrous oxide 
at the hospital now has "a steel 
plate welded to the bottom of it, 50 
if anyone wants to steal the 
cannisters, they have to take the 
whole cage," Baker said. 

He theorizes that students, who 
paSli by the storage area daily on 
foot any bicycle, had "cased out" 
the shed and planned the theft. 

Baker indicated that he thought 
it would be poor policy and poor 
taste if the hospital pressed theft 
charges in this matter. 

At this point, little is known 
about the actual incident as it 
occurred in the Galathea dorm 
suite, but Detective Pam Moes of 

Alan Iloward 

" 

campus police did say that 
Howard collapsed in the presence 
of two other students while inhaling 
the gas from a balloon. 

Technically, she said, Howard 
was an "active participant" in that 
the gas was not forced upon him. 
"We don't see any wrongdoings in 
connection with the death," adding 
that the incident was "unfortu-
nate," but "accidental." 

In reference to the further 
investigation of the case by city 
police, Moes said, "I doubt the DA 
will take any action here." 

SJ Thomas, a deputy with the 
San Diego County Coroner's 
Office, said that it will be another 
week before complete toxicology 
tests on Howard's blood are 
completed. 

"We're looking primarily for 
nitrous oxide, but we're testing for 
everything, which takes a long 
lime." 

A team of psychologists from 
the Counseling and Psychology 
Services office was called in to help 
the residents of Galathea Hall at 
the request of Revelle Dean Ernie 
Mort. 

The group session, which drew 
25 residents, was headed by Mark 
Minson and Sally Ann Greer, 
interns with the service. Minson 
sensed "a lot of relief" following the 
session, and RA Kramer 
concurred. 

Minson's goal was to help those 
troubled by Howard's death 
"make some sense of their 
feelings" so as to better get in touch 
with their emotions. Aoother 
important aspect of his talk was to 
"strengthen their own support 
system." 

Parents Not Bitter, But Shock of Loss, 
Sorrow) Darken Pleasant Memories 
While police and university officials are 

investigating a tragic death a family in an 
affluent suburb northeast of Los Angeles is 
rebuilding its life. 

"We're numb right now, I guess you 
might call it shock," said Alan Howard's 
mother. 

"We realize that Alan is dead ... that he is 
not coming home again." Howard died a 
week ago Wednesday night of 
complications following the inhalation of 
nitrous oxide gas. 

"Alan was always a curious boy, and he 
was just trying something different. Why 
should we feel bitter?" the mother asked. 

"He had a keen mind and was inlo 
everything," she continued. "He also had a 
marvelous sense of humor. We loved our 
Alan very much, and I'm sure any~y 

who met him remembered him and like 
hi " m. 

She reminisced about the lut time abe 
saw her son alive: 

"We spent the Ealter weekend together. 
When we arrived, we saw hili feet lticki~ 
out of the dorm window. When your 6'11' , 
your feet stick out of just about everywhere. 
We had a glorioUl weekend with him." 

"I don't think II.; university changed 
him any," she went on. "He wu the aame 
sweet Alan we always knew." 

Mrs. Howard has not talked to anyone 
here about Alan's death. "The 
administrators - they were all jUlt fac.1 
and names to us. We haven't spoken to 
anyone about Alan." 

"Surely, we've lost a very lpecial part of 
our lives." 

Few of the investigators 
involved in the Howard case were 
familiar with the effects and 
legalities of nitrous oxide gas. 
However, according to one La 
Jolla oral surgeon who uses the 
gas, nitrous oxide use is restricted 
by law. 

Memorial Servi 
Scheduled Here 

Dr. Ronald Hecker said that 
"we normally give a patient a 
combination of 80 percent nitrous 
oxide and 20 percent oxygen when 
using the gas as an anesthetic, and 
even this is bordering on toxicity." 

Taking 100 percent nitrous 
oxide breaths ili "extremely 
dangerous" the dentist warned, as 
he explained that this would starve 
the blood of oxygen to the brain 
.and other vital orllans.

V-ball Coach Disappointed 
With Best Men's Team Ever 
---------------- -------- ---

Dannevik Complains fo Prima Donnas, Uncompetitive School 
------------------------------------. 

BY SCOlT AUJSON 
Staff Wri .... 

Anyone who hasn't 
foDowed the UCSD men'A 
volleyball team this year will 
probably conclude after 
picking up a schedule that the 
spikers' season finale versus 
Cal Lutheran tomorrow wiD 
merely mark the end of 
another typical year for the 
Tritons. 

But that person would be 
wrong. 

The 1980 edition of Triton 
volleyball was an enigma. 
Despite being the best men's 
team to don a UCSD uniform, 
they nevertheless were an 
inconsistent bunch, a club that 
never really lived up to the 
expectations and star billing of 
their feisty little coach, Doug 
Dannevik. 

"Many times this year it was 
k ustrating," said Dannevik. 
'''There were a few prima 
donnas on the team who 
wouldn't make the sacrifice 
neces!;8rf ." 

Dannevik didn ' t name 
names, but he did stress that 
the season as a whole was 
successful. In only his second 
year at the reins, Dannevik 
has built the foundation of a 
solid program, and UCSD is 
now widely respected in the 
world of volleyball as an 
improved, up and coming 
leam. 

" We definitely made some 
strides in the program this 
year. We developed our 
offense, we developed some of 
our younger players, and we 
learned a lot ," he said. 

The Tritons' season jumped 
off to an auspicious start when 
in their opener on Jan. II they 
surprised the Jugadores, three 
gamel to two. Then a highly 
respectable third place finish at 
the A11-Cal Toumament a 
week later had Da nne vik 
drooling over the prospects 
and potential of his squad. 

But then the Tritons 
suffered four consecutive 
setbacks, including two 
heartbreakers to Loyola in a 
span of eight days. The 
Tritons never seemed to 
recover from these two losses , 
even though Dannevik would 
try everything from shuffling 
the line-up to dressing up at 
games to shake them up. 

"We started to slack off in 
our intensity then ," said 
Dannevik, "and then Steve 
(Upp) got hurt, which we 
never really recovered from 
until recently." 

Upp was out a month with a 
.prained ankle, during which 
time UCSD bowed twice to an 

,inferior USIU team. This was 
a mystery. The same UCSD 
Tritons who had beaten 
Berkeley and Stanford and 
who had played other NCAA 

AGENDA 

Division I powerhouses 
though could not defeat USIU. 
Even at lalt week's NIT, the 
spikers could only manage a 
split with USIU. 

"Losing last week to 
USIU again had to be the low 
point of the season," said 
Dannevik. 

And the high point? 
"Beating Northridge last 

week. It was so satisfying 
seeing it all come together 
finally ." 

Indeed, in the match against 
Northridge, the Tritons were 
playing all if it were the 
Nationals, which they vowed 
to do since they had just 
received word that there would 
no Nationals. 

" It was happening just the 
way it was planned," said 
Dannevik. " We had worked 
hard to peak at the right time 
late in the year, and everything 
just started to mesh together. " 

But the meshing was short· 
lived. After blasting out 
Northridge, the next day the 
Tritons played to the mold of 
their roller·coaster season by 
losing games they should have 
won. 

More frustration for 
Dannevik. 

" In the players' defense, I 
must say that playing at 
UCSD i. not playing in the 
best competitive atmosphere," 
said the UCSD coach. "And

Commentary/William Hamilton 

Reviewers Are at Rock Bottom 
There exist many opinions aa to the 

ultimate purpose of rock critics, 
although universality is that they exist to 
infuriate rather than to educate or 
elucidate. Still, CritiCI have never been 
more widely.read nor outspoken in their 
opinions, irrespective of the validity of 
their arguments. 

It il a strange breed of human who is 
attracted to the pompoul and 
excessively·flowered style of the rock 
reviewer. It is axiomatic that any 
individual who delves into criticism of 
anothers' work is probably frustrated 
with music or is abYlmaily stupid. 

In the long run, a reviewers opinion 
on any given band will not adversely 
affect album sales or popularity unless 
the record company il not siphoning 
money into ' advertisement and 
promotion of the group. In this event, the 
reviewer'l opinion becomes a hinge 
upon which the neophyte group can 
either gain admiHance to the rock elite or 
have that tenuous portal Ilammed in 
their kiuerl. 

Some may argue that rock criticism 
.hould have a role in the Ielection of 

those groups to be signed. This is, of 
course, infeasible, as an unknown 
artist's best friend's hastily-written 
publicity and bio sheet is going to weigh 
about as heavily with an A&R man as a 
note from his mother saying that he is a 
good boy. ' 

The emergence of professional hack· 
job artists (Robert Christgau, Lester 
Bangs and Cameron Crowe) who are 
able in three paragraphs or leu to give 
the definite impression that they don't 
like a particular release, is in stark 
contrast to the reviewers frequently 
Published in such definitive publications 
as Modern Recording or High Fide/illl, 
who can, in the same space limitations, 
give you a pretty good overview of what 
to expect, even if you are not famitiar 
with the artist. 

It is a wonder, I think, that the fanner 
group even bothers to write in trade 
joumala, considering they would be at 
home in any context, and no one would 
notice the difference, save for the writer. 

Within the latler group, however , 
many individuals are professionally 

involved with the performance or 
production aspects of music, and are 
educated, intelligent and play 
instruments. While this is certainly not 
manditory to draw a conclusion toward 
a group' II success or failure, it certainly is 
manditory in order to justify your 
opinion with any authority. 

I maintain this position to be true, 
irrespective of the mUlic reviewed. If I 
cannot play sitar, but understand Indian 
music and have heard Ravi Shankar, it 
is a good bet that I can tell you that 
George Harrison is not a good sitar 
player, and a better bet that I can state 
that he is not much of a guitar player, 
either. 

This, however, is not the purpose of 
the reviewer or his review. The purpoae 
is to save you the shame and 
embarallment of bringing home an 
album you haven't heard, and 
discovering to your chagrin that it is 
terrible, having wasted your money and 
having all your friends laugh at you 
behind your back for your obvious lack 
of taste.

In 'Paranoia' All Actions Equally Amoral 
Paranoia/Gerald Kantor 
(independently published) 

Local writer Gerald 
Kantor's recent publication, 
Paranoia, is a collection of 
interrelated short stories in the 
tradition of existentialism and 
humor nair. While the topical 
content might be reminiscent 
01 vintage Burroughs or 
Bukowsky, Kantor has a 
certain flair for writing which, 
while descriptively minimalist, 
is deceptively complex. 

Kantor takes the first person 
narrative in describing his 
world view. For Cash, the 
character through whom he 
speak., the futility 01 existence 
is of no consequence. Life is 
the process of finding 
something to do while waiting 
to die. Cash lives on the fringe 
of social acceptibili ty, 
insulated from others because 
he shuns involvement with 
other.' personal lives. Life is 
for Cash a series of events 
which occur around him. 

bum on a park bench with my 
coat over my face for 
privacy ... A cop came surfing 
out of the tube, riding a double· 
barreled shotgun. I woke up. 
A uniformed cop was nudging 
me with his billy dub. 

"Move yure ass!" 
"I'm waiting for my flight, 

you stupid auhole." , 
In describing as simple an 

act as the pouring of a beer, 
Kantor makes the perfor-
mance of so inconsequential 
and routine an activity seem 
like a thing of heretofore 
unbeheld beauty, by dissecting 
it into its component parts, and 
the attention to detail is 
phenomenal. The representa· 
tion of the characters might 
have been such that they 
would elicit sympathy of at 
least commiseration from the 
reader. No way. The actions 
of the characters belie their 
motives, which are esaentially 
amoral. Bumming a cigarette 
for them has the same ultimate 
moral consequences as 
running over old ladies with a 
truck. Cash makes no value 
judgements and imputes no 
motives to characters which 
camot be inferred by the 
reader vis-a-vis their actions 
and Iifestylel.

There is a phenomenology 
which persists throughout the 
book, a total involvement of 
each char.cter in the moment, 
the heuristic dissection of the 
epoch ·into itl fundamental bit 
of exteiqporaneity. The 
technique used to accompliah .

Throughout the book, the 
themes of alcoholism and 
dislike for agents of social 
control (e.g. police) are readily 
apparent. Aicohol is a dietary 
staple rather than a drug, and 
police are to be considered 
something that mUlt be 
immediately scraped off of 
one'l shoe if stepped in. The 
libidinal urge is normally 
grai!fied in solitude, and 'work' 
is a four-letter word (like 
'cops'). 

The isolation of the moment 
is successfully accomplished in 
the"Edmund's House" 
chapter, making this residence 
about as appealing as the

Suicide Threat Bluff 
Continued from pCJlle 1 
the suicide threata to keep the 

~ry out of print. 
In the .tory, Third coDege 

sophomore May Smith 
charpd that Wright had 
uaaulted her Iut tuesday 
niIht in the Student Center. 

Smith charaea that Wriaht 
.,abbed and fancied her, 
poeated her .,ainat a window 
and Mid ''let', screw." She has 
taken her IIory to the U€SD 
police, who .. y that no action 
can be taken until she files a 
complaint wih the dillrict 
atlorney's alta. 

When ubcI about the 
incident Weclneaday night 
Wrilht Mid, ". made a pus at 
a pI, I admit it. An~ 
beyond that is balderal. 

Reached by phone at his 
home Wedneaday nisht, 
Wricht al firat an.wered 
quation8 -'t the incident 
but then Aiel he did not wiIh to 
.. QUaIecI at ... 

tie .... chqed hia mind 
.... uicI thIIl he wished 'to be 
quoted .. Nying, "Why dan't 
you CII up a lawyer and uk 
IIim aboUt what you ue 
doinI?" 

W'riJlht later called The 
Dail" Guardian office and had 
the operator interrupt a phone 
call at a Dai/., Guardian 
reporters' home to leave th~ 
message, "What if every 81rt 
you made a pass at filed 
criminal charges." 

Later still, as The Dall" 
Guardian approached 
deadline, DallJl GuarCiian 
editors received a call from 
another AS Pre.idential 
candidate, Linda Sabo, who 
had been viii . Revelle RA 
Rich MiL. W~t, Saba said, 
had just called Mills, the RA 
on emerlency duty, and 
threatened to kiD hirnaelf. 

Sabo told the Guardian 
editors that Wright wanted to 
call them to talk about the 
.tory. 

When Wright called he told 
the editon "U)'ou run the story 
ru end it all. 

Two more times that night 
he called the Guardian oIflc:e 
and threatened to kill hinueIf if 
the .tory ran . 

A UCSD police officer, 
whom 1Jw c~ Guardian 
editon had to contult, 
c:ounMIed thai he didn't think 

Wright was aerioua. 
" I' ve counseled suicide 

victims before, and just 
hearing the ItOry from you it 
aeema to me that something is 
missing here," the officer told a 
Dail" GlUUdian editor. 

Sabo said she was not sure if 
Wright wal l erioul, but 
commented that he was acting 
"pretty lcary." 

Student Organizations 
Advisor Randy Woodard, 
who heard about the incident 
from Sabo, confronted Wright 
at the candidates' fonun. 

Woodard said later, "I 
think what he was doing was 
trying to jam the Guardian 
from printing the ltory that 
wal in hi. view a character 
asauination. II 

Beyond that hil threall had 
not been serious, all Wright 
would say on the record to a 
lJGil" Guardian re]!orter 
yesterday Wal that 'Some-
times j can be a pretty off the 
wall SUy." 

UCSD attorney Nick 
Asuilar said yesterday that 
Wright had contacted his 
office and Wal contemplatirur

Daily Guardian editor that a 
s tory co ntaining the 
a1lega~nl agai~.t him would 
appear In today s paper. 

Smith laid her run-in with 
Wright began al she was 
waiting to make a call at 
EDNA while Wright was on 
the phone. 

"After he got off the phone 
we started to talk about the 
campaign. I'm not involved in 

rliticl, but my boyfriend ii, 10 was interested in what he 
(Wright) had to say." 

"I went with him to the pub, 
but before we sat down he said 
that he had forgotten his Linda 
Ronstadt record back at 
EDNA. The records were not 
there, but then he laid he had 
to make a phone call so we 
went to the phone booth by 
KSDT. 

" .. . Something went wrong 
with the call - it didn't go 
through, but while he was 
talking to the operator he 
grabbed a piece of paper with 
my name on it which I was 
holding in Iront of me. He 
grab. the paper and then starll 
poking at my pelvic bone. 

"I told him to quit it and he 
did. So we .tarted back to the 
pub.

way though. We walked by 
what used to be the Guardian 
office (now the ASsorted 
Vinyl record store). He 
stopped at the bulletin board 
there and began to read it. 

" I walked over to that booth 
there that looks like a puppet 
stage. It has two holes that 
look like they are for your 
arms and a hole that looks like 
sort of a stage for the puppets. 

"I put my arml in the holes 
and said, 'hey what's this?' 

"He comes up behind me 
and grabbed my hands and 
pressed me between the box 
and him ... then he sayl ' I 
would really like to screw you. 
I give a good fuck .. : 

"After that I managed to 
push him away and ran ... 

"He came after me, but not 
very fast. I ran to the elevator 
and went to the second Hoor . 
From there I could see he was 
going back to the pub. 

"He left a little later so I 
went in to tell the story to my 
friend. Then he carne back 
and started joking about all 
those 'jerks who try to rape 

• women ... 
" I told him to go away, but I 

wish I had made more of a
