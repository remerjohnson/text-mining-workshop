Barbara Cano, a Revelle College senior 
majoring in physiology and neuroscience, died 
Sunday, Jan. 30, in a collision on her way to work 
as a nanny. 

“We’re in total shock...total shock,” Cano’s aunt 
Rosita Olmstead said.

Cano was traveling southbound on Interstate 
15 and took the State Route 56/Ted Williams 
Parkway exit, where she was initially in the right 
lane taking State Route 56. 

According to the California Highway Patrol 
collision report, Cano veered left for an unknown 
reason and traveled across the off-ramp into a dirt 
area causing her to go airborne. The vehicle then 
traveled over the dirt area and onto I-15, where the 

vehicle collided with another. 
The individuals in the other vehicle, a 41-year-

old female driver and a 10-year-old female 
passenger, survived.

“As her father, I watched 
my daughter Barbara grow 
from a teenager into a 
beautiful, responsible young 
adult,” Nicolas Cano said 
in an e-mail. “As the cliché 
goes, ‘the good die young,’ 
and Barbara’s journey has 
ended. In spirit of Barbara, 
live each day to the fullest 
for life is not to be taken for 
granted.”  

Cano attended Mission Hills High School in 
San Marcos, moving there her junior year  in order 

to live with her mother.
Dallas Patterson, a high school friend who was 

her date to junior prom and on the swim team 
with her, commented on Cano’s personality. 

“The biggest thing that you always noticed 
about her was how friendly, smart and 
hardworking she was,” Patterson said. “She was 
really intelligent, really ambitious [and] really 
motivated. She really knew what her goals were 
[and] what she wanted to be, which was pretty 
unusual for most of the people I knew back then.”

For her senior year, Cano returned to her 
hometown to attend Los Lunas High School in 
New Mexico. Cano then enrolled at UCSD, where 
she was scheduled to graduate this June.

“Barbara went to San Diego to attend UCSD to 
pursue her dream of becoming a neurosurgeon,” 
Cano’s father said. “While there, she made many 

friends and there were countless experiences, I 
heard of many.”

Patterson commented on her career goals. 
“She seemed to be the only one who knew where 
she was going,” Patterson said. “When I first met 
her, she always knew she wanted to be a doctor. 
She always talked about it. She was very, very 
studious [and] very hardworking.”

Cano was a member of UCSD’s Kappa Kappa 
Gamma sorority for two years.

UCSD alumnus Krystle Vega was one of 
Cano’s sorority sisters and a close friend with 
whom Cano spoke with on the phone every day.

“I am beyond grateful to have had Barbara as 
such a huge part of my life for the past four years,” 
Vega said in an e-mail. “I am honored to have such

A trolley that runs from downtown San Diego to UCSD could arrive on campus within the next five years. UCSD administration is working with city officials on the plan that is scheduled to be launched in 2016, though the trolley could 
be completed as early as 2015.

The budget for the project — as approved by the San Diego Association of Governments 
board of directors — is $1.2 billion.

“We are at a point where we have a general understanding of the routes that the trolley would 
be taking,” Vice Chancellor of Resource Management & Planning Gary Matthews said. “Nothing 
is finalized, but we’re getting closer to the specifics.”

According to Matthews, SANDAG has been holding open forums to discuss routes and the 
trolley’s impact with members of the UCSD and greater San Diego community.

“There was an enormous amount of support for the locally preferred alternative,” SANDAG 
Project Development Program Manager Leslie Blanda said. “There were a couple of alignments 
that the public didn’t like and those did not move forward.”

Over 15 UCSD departments are a part of the Light Rail Transit Group that advises Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox to identify campus impacts. Undergraduates, Sixth College and Preuss School 
are part of the collective advisory group.

The locally preferred alternative currently refers to the proposed plan that has had the positive

Students held separate protests 
on Feb. 2 to bring light to two events: 
the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia, 
and the possible deportation of 
UCSD bioengineering researcher 
Wilda Helen.

Student groups — including the 
Arab Student Union, Students for 
Justice in Palestine, Students for 
Civil Rights in Iran, the Muslim 
Student Association and the Student 
Sustainability Collective — held a 
demonstration to show solidarity 
and create awareness about the 
uprisings occurring under the 
authoritarian governments of Egypt 
and Tunisia.

“Each of our organizations [is] 
each rooted in promoting peace, 

justice and empowerment,” Student 
Sustainability Collective Energy 
and Waste Director Annie Le said 
in an e-mail. “Our organizations 
collaborated to coordinate this 
demonstration in solidarity with 
the movements of the people in 
Egypt and Tunisia.” 

The protest included student 
and faculty speakers, including A.S. 
Council President and Tunisian-
American Wafa Ben Hassine, 
communication professor Gary 
Fields and ethnic studies assistant 
professor Roshanak Kheshti.

Marshall College sophomore 
Meryem Kamil said about 50 people 
attended the demonstration, which 
was finalized two days before the 
event.

GenesÊCanÊDetermineÊHowÊYouÊChooseÊYourÊFriends
SCIENCEÊANDÊTECHNOLOGY

By Rebecca Horwitz
Staff Writer

According to new research, 
your genes may play a determining 
factor in what clique you belong 
to. A recent study conducted by 
School of Medicine professor James 
Fowler, Ph.D. student Jaime Settle 
and Harvard University professor 
Nicholas Christakis considered 
which variations of genes are 
exhibited in groups of friends. 

“The purpose [of this study] is 
to answer the fundamental question 
of whether or not people who are 
not related to one another, but 
were friends share the same genes,” 
Fowler said. 

The scientists studied six genes, 
two of which — the DRD2 and 
the CYP2A6 — turned out to be 
correlated with friendship. The 
study showed that friends usually 
shared the same version of the 
DRD2 gene. But they also exhibited 
a negative correlation with the 
CYP2A6 gene, with friends having 

opposing versions of the gene. 
“Part of this investigation 

is trying to figure out if there’s 
evolutionary basis for social 
networks,” Fowler said. 

Fowler’s team found evidence 
that genes influence how central 
we are to a social network and how 
many people name us as friends. 
Transitivity, a property influenced 
by the genes, is the probability that 
two of your friends are friends with 
each other. According to Fowler, 
this means that our genes influence 
whether two other people are 
friends. 

“We got into this because 
we wanted to explain this ‘birds 
of a feather flock together’ 
phenomenon,” Fowler said. 

Genes are already known 
to influence certain behavior, 
the choices we make and our 
susceptibility to peer pressure. 
These behaviors spread easily 
through our networks, because 
the people within them are also 
susceptible and connected to one 

another.
He also said that the principle 

underlying the property 
being studied questioned the 
metagenomic status of humans — 
whether we’re only influenced by 
our genes or by the genes of the 
people who surround us.

“The fundamental question that 
comes out of that bigger question 
is well, if that’s true, then what 
we would expect is that people 
who we choose to associate with 
— our friends — ought to have 
similar genes to us,” Fowler said. 
“We already know they have similar 
traits; we tend to hang out with 
people the same level of education, 
we tend to hang out with people 
who have the same political ideals.”

The study suggests that the social 
environment, which is a product 
formed by an individiual’s genes 
and the genes of those surrounding 
them yourselves with, affect people’s 
outlines.

There are about 25,000 genes 
with which Fowler and his team 

want to do a full genome study 
to understand the consequences of 
shared genes. The future studies 
will test to see if there is evidence 
that human beings as a species 
have co-evolved with their social 
networks.

“Social networks are in our 
nature, they’re part of what makes 
us unique as human species,” 
Fowler said.

which adjusts for the annual consumer 
price index. Metildi said UCAB 
reserves will be depleted to nothing if 
no action is taken.

AVP of Student Organizations 
Carli Thomas is working on a forum 
for student organization visibility 
during the Sun God Festival. 

Muir College Senator Lynne 
Swerhone asked councilmembers to

UCSDÊPreparesÊforÊClintonÊConference
By Chris McCoy
Staff Writer

The Clinton Global Initiative 
University, an international college 
conference to solve global issues, is 
coming to UCSD from April 1 to 4. 
Former President Bill Clinton and a 
host of celebrities, including actor 
Sean Penn, will attend the event. 

The three-day event will begin 
with an opening reception at RIMAC 
Arena. Saturday will be include skill 
workshops and feature sessions, and 
Sunday will involve a large-scale 
student community service project 
to be completed off campus. Clinton 
will be present all three days. All 
conference attendees are required 
to spearhead a project that must be 
fulfilled within the following year. 
The projects are required to improve 
social or environmental conditions 
are universities or communities 
across the world. 

As of Jan. 25, 19 applicants 
from UCSD have been accepted. 
The application deadline is Feb. 7.  
About 3,000 applications have been 
received so far.

“The goal is to gather the 
community and to see how students 
are really interested to seeing how it 
is outside the community,” Eleanor 
Roosevelt College sophomore and 
CGIU representative Melissa Etehad 
said.

Of the 1,200 participants, a 
maximum of 240, or 20 percent of 
the applicants, can be from UCSD. 

“They’re so many projects 
throughout the entire world that can 
help people all over,” she said. “We’re 
passionate about making a change. 
We want people to know that UCSD 
are making a difference outside of 
the community.”

Last year, 1,500 students from 
344 universities came from all 50 
states to CGIU at the University 
of Miami. More than a quarter of 

them were international students 
from 77 different countries. Over 
the past three CGIU meetings, 
representatives from 575 schools, 
99 countries and all 50 states were 
present.

The CGIU team announced that 
it is holding the conference at UCSD 
largely because of its reputation for 
the student body’s commitment to 
service. 

“As the no. 1 for university 
service, commitment to service, 
giving back, UCSD came up to be a 
perfect fit,” CGIU Communications 
Director Hannah Steiman said. “The 
campus embraced us. It’s an amazing 
university, a great campus.”

Community service proposals 
require a tangible action plan on 
one of the subjects of education, 
environment and climate change, 
peace and human rights, poverty 
alleviation and public health.

“Students are able to propose 
a community service project in 
any of the five,” Steiman said. “We 
thought it would be a perfect fit 
to engage a student body that is 
already activated and energized, and 
mobilized around some of our key 
issues.

With 1,200 students participating 
in the conference, including 
international students, there are 
various logistical issues to handle, 
like transportation, accommodation 
and security. The coordinators said 
they are confident it will all come 
together since UCSD has hosted 
high-profile gatherings in the past.

“We work with hotels, security to 
pull off a safe and fun opportunity for 
students,” Steiman said. “We will rely 
heavily on local security to help out.”

UCSD Community Law Project 
Director and National City Vice 
Mayor Alejandra Sotelo-Solis, 
along with the Center for Student 
Involvement, are working with the 
CGIU staff to prepare for the event 

and coordinate 800 to 900 students 
to complete a service project in San 
Diego county. 

“For CGIU, this [will be] the 
last day of the conference, it’s really 
putting into practice the theories that 
you’re going to be learning about — 
[having] workshops, hearing from 
the keynote speakers, putting that 
energy to work,” Sotelo-Solis said.

Sotelo-Solis expects everything 
to be finalized by the end of the 
month.

“Our role as part of the Center 
for Student Involvement will be to 
identify areas that will be ideal for 
a community service project,l” she 
said. “Again recognizing the number 
of people, what services they provide, 
rain contingency, a lot of variables 
that come into play — security for 
the President. It’s a great team that 
we have going.” The CGIU student 
organization at UCSD has done 
tabling and advertisements to the 
student population. 

Students such as Etehad have been 
working to prepare.

“What we’ve done is that we’ve 
done tabling, we have this event and 
make advertisements so that people 
can learn more about the issues that 
are involved with global affairs, and 
they come here, they listen to this, 
get excited to go and they submit 
their application,” Etehad said. 
“The goal ... is to prepare for the 
conference and make a community 
of UCSD students who are taking on 
a challenge, making a difference in 
the world.”

While Steiman said she could not 
disclose the overall cost of the event, 
she said it is free for all students who 
are accepted to the program. 

“We, President Clinton, along 
with the CGI, think it’s going to be a 
great event,” Steiman.

There are two types of people in the world: those who are punctual, and those who are 
like me.     

When it comes to being on time, 
despite all efforts at avoiding the 
‘snooze’ button, it just doesn’t happen 
for me. My internal gauge that deter-
mines how long something will take is 
permanently defective.

So it’s lucky that, growing up, my 
dad taught me some of the best excus-
es for every occasion.

The all-purpose: “There was a ter-
rible accident down the block! I think 
it was a three-car pile-up. I hope no 
one got hurt.” The moderately urgent: 
“I’m one exit away” (as I pull out of 
my driveway). And, the gutsiest of 
all: “I locked my keys in the trunk of 
my car and I don’t have a spare.  The 
AAA guy is breaking into my car as we 
speak … be there as soon as I can.”

Despite the bad karma that’s accu-
mulated over these years I’ve been 
driving, I’ve learned two things about 
myself.

First, I hate people who are early, 
even if it’s just by a few minutes. 
They’re either way too eager to see me, 
or they just don’t have a life — either 
way, it’s unnatural. 

But on the flipside, I’ve become 
envious of the punctual. 

They don’t have to constantly 
apologize for circumstances “beyond 
their control.” And since they’re not 
late, they’re not inclined to speed, 
which means the wonderful California 
Highway Patrol won’t  be inclined to 
write them $400 tickets. (Not that I’m 
speaking from personal experience or 
bitterness.)

So, after Googling how to “not be 
late,” WikiHow gifted me with, of all 
things, a 12-step plan. It just seems 
excessive — it’s not like I’m an alco-
holic, and this really shouldn’t require 
that many steps — so I only read the 
first four.

The first step is self-actualization: 
“Acknowledge you have a problem.” 
(Done.)

Be conscious of the time. (Well, no 
shit. I know what time it is, I just can’t 
control how long it’ll take me to get 
somewhere.) 

Don’t hit the snooze button. (Ha. 
We’ll see how that goes.)

Commit yourself to be 15 minutes 
early. (Finally, something I can work 
with.)

The day after this extensive aca-
demic research, I had a job interview 
at 1 p.m. Following this plan, I figured 
I should try to be there at 12:45 p.m. 
Driving down Miramar Road, it was 
just my luck: Every single light I hit 
turned red. Of course. 

This must be all that bad karma 
finally catching up to me. As I pulled 
into the Panera Bread parking lot, I 
checked my phone: 1:03 p.m. Not bad. 

Later that day, I had a 4 p.m. class. 
Usually, it takes me 30 minutes from 
walking to the Arriba stop to pulling 
into the Mandeville bus loop. That day, 
I left 45 minutes early. Stepping off 
the bus, I had an extra 15 minutes to 
kill — and that could only mean one 
thing: Mandeville Coffee Cart and hot-
tie grad-student patrol. Maybe there’s 
something to this whole ‘punctuality’ 
thing after all. 

After 133 undergrad parking spots in Sixth College were eliminated this quarter, Sixth 
College sophomore Allie Platt took a 
stand. On Jan. 25, Platt created an offi-
cial petition for more ‘S’ parking spots 
on campus, and the cause has apparently 
struck a nerve: Since then, more than 
2,700 students have signed.

The petition statistics help justify the 
students’ anger: While the undergrad 
population has swelled by 43 percent in 
the last decade, to over 23,000 students, 
the office of Transportation and Parking 
Services has eliminated about 2,000 stu-
dent spots due to continued construc-
tion on campus.

According to Vice Chancellor of 
Resources Management Gary Matthews, 
‘S’ permit sales have slid in the past few 
years due to the rising use of alternative 
transit — this is all well and good, but 
by the looks of the petition, they haven’t 
slid enough to assuage the frustrations 
of ‘S’ permit holders.

Platt and some 3,000 others have 
good cause to be upset. It’s already not 
uncommon to wait upwards of half an 

hour to park in Muir College surface 
lots, and with the elimination of dozens 
more S-permit spots, the wait is bound 
only to increase. 

And while the loss of those under-
grad parking spots has been paired with 
cuts to grad student and faculty parking, 
the distribution is glaringly uneven: 
23,000 undergrads (many of whom, 
granted, don’t have cars parked on 
campus) share a total of 4,910 ‘S’ spots, 
while 6,059 faculty members and grad 
students are well-provided for with a 
combined 6,003 spots.

But however frustrating it is when 
colleges are left with only one paved lot 
available, most students fail to realize the 
root issue at hand. The UCSD Master 
Plan stipulates that no surface park-
ing lot (i.e. none of the ones replaced 
by expanded on-campus housing or 
department buildings) is to be perma-
nent, which means that whenever it 
comes time to erect a new building on 
campus, existing parking spots are the 
first to go.   

Gov. Jerry Brown wants you to vote to raise your own taxes — and in return, he 
promises to rebuild California. 
 Needless to say, now is probably 
not the best time to be asking 
more from California’s citizens, 
and Brown duly noted that this is 
by no means a popular request. It’s 
probably not a feasible one either, 
but when the state has already been 
declared to be in a “fiscal state of 
emergency” and every sector is 
suffering massive cuts, it’s a breath 
of fresh air to see that our leader at 
least has a focused, concrete plan. 

The crux of the governor’s 
Monday night State of the State 
speech lies upon this proposed spe-
cial election. Brown, who previous-
ly served as governor for two terms 
beginning in 1975 and was inau-
gurated for his third in January, 
wants state Congress to approve an 
election in June that would allow 
voters to approve the extension of 
higher vehicle fees and sales tax. 

This initiative, combined with 

Brown’s already proposed $12.5 
billion in budget cuts — including 
over $1.4 billion from higher edu-
cation —  is part of Brown’s goal of 
bridging our state’s ever-widening 
$25-billion deficit. 

Nice try, but even if the GOP 
approves the special election, it’s 
unlikely that the vote will pass. An 
extension of the same temporary 
tax increase already appeared on 
California’s ballot two years ago, in 
May 2009, and was quickly voted 
down. 

With the economy only margin-
ally better than it was in 2009, it’s 
hard to imagine voters turning out 
to offer more of their income when 
they are receiving less funding, no 
matter how necessary for the state’s 
recovery may be. 

So Brown is better off focus-
ing on other branches of his plan 
— which include working to create 
more jobs, focusing on renewable 
energy and investing in education 
— than holding his breath on this 
one. 

But, feasibility of the tax 
increases aside, Brown should be 
commended for calling for a legis-
lative check-in and never skirting 
the elephant in the room that is 
our fiscal crisis. 

With California between a 
rock and a hard place, Brown has 
targeted the Golden State’s big-
gest problem with alacrity, asking 
48,000 state employees to return 
cell phones, canceling fleet services 
to save money and both being 
frank with worries that lawmakers 
do not have an adequate plan for 
the state and stressing that he is 
open to suggestions from all sides. 
His 15-minute State of the State 
speech pulled no punches in regard 
to where we are now, acknowledg-
ing that “it’s serious this time.”

This is a contrast to former 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who 
told the Los Angeles Times last 
month that he should have “used 
his political muscle” and forced 
residents to confront the budget 
crisis instead of backing an initia-

tive to borrow $15 billion. 
Brown’s ideas may not be the 

most welcome or even the best, 
but unlike his predecessor, he’s not 
afraid to reach out, use some force 
and make himself unpopular for 
the good of the state. 

Gov.’s Proposals are Unpopular, But at Least He’s Got a Plan

OPINIONÊ THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 2011Ê THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

And though there are dozens of 
unoccupied graduate student parking 
spaces on any given day of the week 
in the East Regents lots 
near Triton ballpark, the 
fact remains that when 
it comes to parking, the 
university does have 
to give priority to the 
convenience of a relative 
few in order to incentiv-
ize working here. 

The suggestion that 
some of those exist-
ing ‘A’ and ‘B’ spots be converted to 
‘S’ spots may be ideologically sound 
— undergrads represent, after all, the 
overwhelming majority of campus — 

but petitioners shouldn’t hold their 
breath.  

If the petition indicates anything 
(other than the irritation of every stu-

dent who’s ever fought 
fellow swoopers for a 
spot), it’s the need for 
TPS to reevaluate the 
permit system. At UC 
Davis, freshmen are 
barred from bring-
ing cars to campus. At 
Berkeley, students can 
purchase a specific pass 
for carpooling. (Our 

office allows carpoolers to share the 
cost of a permit, though the system 
mostly operates as informal agree-
ments between commuters.)

And at UCLA, students may apply 
for permits, but none are guaranteed a 
spot; the campus transportation office 
uses a need-based point system to 
evaluate each application, taking into 
account relevant factors such as class 
standing, on-campus employment and 
the distance of one’s commute. 

Each of these options is worth 
assessing and it’s time to change how 
we issue our permits. An estimated 
53,000 students, employees and faculty 
members commute to UCSD daily. 
The fewer who spend half an hour 
daily searching for a place to park — 
whether by means of improved car-
pool programs, shuttle lines or even, 
perhaps, the proposed San Diego-wide 
trolley system — the better.

Dear Editor,
Everyone who had the pleasure 

of meeting Barbara is truly blessed. 
She is the most genuine, amazing, 
beautiful, smart, inspiring person I 
have ever met. I feel so lucky to have 
been able to spend six wonderful 
years calling Barbara my best friend. 
When I met her back in high school, 
she had just transferred to school in 
San Marcos.  It was the first night of 
swim team tryouts, and I had been 
told she was my competition. We 
swam the same events and I knew 
there was a possibility she could 
take my spot on the team. However, 
when I talked to her, none of that 
mattered.  Our personalities clicked 
instantly and she quickly became 
my best friend. Barb only stayed at 
Mission Hills for one year before 
moving to New Mexico for her 
senior year of high school. Before 
she left, she and I sat for hours recit-
ing all the good times we’d had and 
would go back and forth saying our 
inside jokes. Even though she was in 
a different state, Barb and I remained 
friends and we were reunited when 
we both decided to attend UCSD.

 My memories of Barbara from 
high school and college are filled 
with joy and laughter. Barb had a 
contagious smile; when she smiled, 
everyone in the room did. She also 
had an amazing sense of humor. She 
is by far the funniest person I have 

ever met and the two of us could 
look at anything and find it hilari-
ous. I could always trust Barbara. 
She was the voice of reason when 
I was upset and overreacting. She 
laughed with me during the good 
times and supported me through the 
bad. She was by my side at the first 
Welcome Week dance, the Warren 
concerts, nights out in PB and Vegas 
and the time we had to walk all the 
way across campus in high heels. 
I have so many memories with 
Barbara that it is impossible for me 
to pick one to exemplify how amaz-
ing she was. The world has truly lost 
a remarkable and inspiring young 
woman. Barb will always be in my 
thoughts and prayers and I will cher-
ish the memories we have forever. 
Words really cannot even begin to 
explain how phenomenal Barbara is 
or the impact she has had upon my 
life or that of all those she has met. I 
am so blessed to have had Barbara as 
my best friend.

reinforcement from the public also 
known as the Mid-Coast Corridor 
Transit Project.

Locations for stops are still 
being discussed, but will most likely 
include Pepper Canyon Hall and 
a spot near the Preuss School and 
Health facilities.

Environmental studies will be 
completed by the end of 2011 and 
publicly released in 2012, according 
to SANDAG Project Development 
Program Manager Greg Gastelum.

“We’re developing a footprint,” 
Gastelum said. “Then we can start 
evaluating those areas that are 
within that footprint to make an 
assessment.”

A fare structure has not been 
set. Currently, SDSU students pay 

$3 one-way and $5 for an all-day 
pass. Matthews said that UCSD 
wants fare structures to emulate the 
arrangement set with Metropolitan 
Transit System and North County 
Transit. 

UCSD Director of Physical 
Planning Brad Werdick said a trolley 
can hold up to 120 passengers and 
travel at a maximum of 55 miles per 
hour, running every 7.5 minutes.

“[With] greater transportation 
options on campus, people are not 
bringing as many cars to campus,” 
Matthews said. “We haven’t sold as 
many parking permits over the last 
several years as we had done in the 
past.”

a warm, loving, fun and selfless best 
friend that would do anything to make 
the people she loved happy.”

Volunteer Services Manager 
Susan Vandendriesse said Cano was 
a volunteer for Scripps Memorial 
Hospital-La Jolla since last summer.

“She was a dedicated volunteer 
who was very supportive of our staff 
and patients,” Vandendriesse said. 
“All of our volunteers are a big part 
of our staff here and I think she was 
pursuing a career in medicine and 
will be missed by all of the people 
that she worked with or volunteered 
with here.”

Cano’s family in New Mexico will 
be holding a memorial and funeral 
service for her. A date has not yet 
been set.

“We don’t know anything yet 

because they’re supposed to bring her 
body home and they haven’t released 
her yet,” Olmstead said. “We still 
don’t know anything as far as when 
services will be.”

Olmstead and Patterson will hold 
a memorial service for her in San 
Diego as well, but the date has not 
been determined. Cano is survived 
by her mother Julie Reger and father 
Nicolas Cano. 

“She lived each  day, taking none 
for granted, as some of the journal 
entries I have come across express 
[that] ‘there were no bad days,’ Cano’s 
father said. “Enjoy your lives, follow 
your dreams, and as my baby girl 
believed in life and death, make this 
place a little better having lived.”

“A lot of people were walking by, it was right in 
front of Library Walk, and start listening in,” Office of 
the President Press Secretary Reem Ateyeh said. “Other 
reactions were just looking, listening. It 
didn’t seem like anyone had any negative 
reactions. It was pretty positive.”

Kamil said the event was relevant to 
students.

“I personally had wanted to do 
something because I felt that it was 
really necessary for the campus to know 
something is going on beyond just 
classes,” Kamil said.

The group marched with baguettes, 
which Le said were to reflect the revolts 
in Egypt.

“The revolutionary baguettes wielded 
today mirror the protests of the Jasmine 
Revolution and those in Egypt against 
the shortage of food and high prices 
for staples,” Le said. “Central to the 
struggle is literally fighting to eat and we 
wanted to demonstrate this particularly 
visceral, essential reason that Tunisians 
and Egyptians are rising up.”

During the same afternoon, members 
from the solidarity demonstration joined 
about 50 postdoctoral researchers, 
academic student employees and faculty 
members to occupy the Chancellor’s 
Complex for about 25 minutes and protest the appeal 
process of researcher Wilda Helen.

“We call on Chancellor Fox to intervene 
and provide Dr. Helen a chance to appeal her 
termination,” Xiaoqing Cao said in a statement.  
Cao is the president of the  United Auto Workers 5810, 
a union for UC postdoctoral researchers. 

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox was not in the office at 
the time of protest.

Helen, who is from Indonesia, worked as a 
postdoctoral researcher at bioengineering professor 
Adam Engler’s stem cell biology and bioengineering 
laboratory for two years before being terminated on 

Jan. 6.
Helen then filed an appeal for her termination under 

the terms of UAW’s collective bargaining agreement.
“Her termination, we believe, is based on false 

allegations about her work, so she is appealing through 
the grievance process in the union contract,” 
UAW 5810 representative Scott Clifthorne 
said.

Clifthorne said UCSD deleted her record 
in the federal Student and Exchange Visitor 
Information System. 

“[The university] is not required to do 
that,” Clifthorne said. “They chose to do 
that. The university knew that Dr. Helen was 
appealing her termination.”

After an employer deletes an employee 
in the SEVIS system, he or she has 30 days 
to leave the country or else remain illegally. 
Through the system, Helen is required to 
leave the United States by this Saturday, 
Feb. 5. 

“Dr. Helen wants to appeal her 
termination, wants to take it to arbitration 
[and] wants to present the facts to a neutral, 
third-party arbitrator but the university is 
trying to force her out of the country this 
Saturday before she has a chance to do that,” 
Clifthorne said. 

Clifthorne said the grievance process 
takes a long time. If the issue is not resolved 
through the department, university labor 

relations or the UC Office of the President, then the 
appeal is taken to a neutral, third-party arbitrator. 

“She is being denied due process,” Clifthorne said. 
“If she was a U.S. postdoc, she would easily have the 
right to go through the full grievance procedure and go 
through an arbitrator.” 

Engler said in an e-mail he could not comment on 
the topic due to confidentiality issues. Labor relations 
specialist Belinda Hein, who is handling the case, could 
not be reached for comment.

TONIGHT

S tupidity often seems directly propor-tional to how famous someone is (or, as Kanye puts it, “The ego is overdone 
… it’s like hoodies”). Most seem to think 
public celebrity mishaps are a rare thing 

(false) or that most are unintentional (also 
false).  For your amusement, here’s my 
roundup of the stupidest celebrity head-
lines over the past two weeks: 
Lady Gaga is working on a perfume — 
which smells of blood and semen. 

First off, celebrities should not pioneer 
their own perfume lines. Spending 40 
hours a week singing on stage, churning 
out addictive pop songs and sporting a 
sweat-soaked crotch doesn’t make some-
one an expert on the art of perfumery 
(go away already, Fergie). Second, exactly 
what demographic is Lady Gaga’s perfume 
(which one can only hope will be called 
“men’s locker room”) appealing to? Serial 
killers? The cast of “True Blood”? Megan 
Fox? Hold on — no one.  Even Foxy 
wipes that mess up before she steps out. 
Kobe Bryant wants Pau Gasol to be a 
“black swan.”

Just when the Hollywood frenzy over 
Lamar Odom and Shrek Kardashian’s 
nuptials died down, Kobe Bryant — like 
the visionary team captain he is — came 
out with this movie analogy gem in an 
interview with ESPN:

“When I’m out there being aggres-
sive and doing my thing, [Gasol] needs 
to follow suit and just be just as aggres-
sive which is hard for him because 
it’s kind of against his nature ... Even 
when he was in Memphis and he was 
the go-to guy, he was always very nice. 
Very white swan. I need him to be black 
swan.”

No word (yet) on whether Bryant 
plans to incorporate homoerotica as 
a regular part of the Lakers’ pre-game 
rituals — fingers crossed that tutus 
become a part of their uniforms. 
James Franco teaches James Franco 
about James Franco.

When Movieline recently announced 
that Columbia College Hollywood 
would be offering a Masters course 
taught by James Franco, UCLA film 
students heaved a collective sigh of 
relief. The course, called “Editing James 
Franco … with James Franco” (seriously 
— even the college’s course registrar is 
laughing at this shit) will have 12 stu-
dents create a 30-minute documentary 
using footage from the actor’s career. 
Franco plans on occasionally attending 
the class and Skyping in to lecture, too. 

Franco’s overexposed self-love affair 
is sort of like Speidi 2.0. Maybe it’ll be 
“irreconcilable differences” for Franco 
and Franco, too.
They Tried to Make Him go to Rehab 

 As Egypt tears itself inside-out, the 
press has latched onto a greater tragedy — 
Charlie Sheen of “Two and a Half Men” 
took a break from starring in the world’s 
worst sitcom to check into a rehab center 
after being rushed to an LA hospital, 
complaining of severe abdominal pain.  
According to TMZ, Lindsay Lohan recent-
ly spoke out on the crisis, saying Sheen 
was in a “life or death situation” and was 
“thrilled” that the actor is seeking help.

You know you have a problem when 
was-that-a-stop-sign-where’s-my-fucking-
coke Lohan is offering you her dearest 
condolences. Here’s hoping (knowing) 
CBS can find some other crap to fill their 
9 p.m. slot.  Or, to quote the good man 
Kanye once more: “Hangovers ain’t good 
man… hangovers ain’t good.”

T
here’d be no “Chicago,” no 
“Cabaret” and no “Sweeney Todd” 
if it weren’t for German playwright 
Bertolt Brecht and one of his most 

famous works, “The Threepenny Opera.” 
Brecht’s landmark 1928 script — along 
with the innovative music of Kurt Weill 
— sparked the darkly comic, jazz-cabaret 
style that has given birth to some of the 

most famous musi-
cals of our time. 

With John Gay’s 
18th-century opera 
“The Beggar’s 
Game” as its source 
material, Brecht 
crafted a musi-
cal that claimed 
to be “by and for 
beggars.” Brecht’s 
world of Victorian 

London is rife with familiar characters: 
cold-blooded vagrants, thieves, whores 
and backstabbers. And like the Sweeney 
Todds and Roxie Harts that it inspired, 
“The Threepenny Opera’”s cast of dark 
characters is appealing enough to seduce 
the audience straight to the bottom of 
the chain.

For UCSD’s adaptation — run-
ning at the Sheila and Hughes Potiker 
Theatre until Saturday night — third-
year MFA student and director Jeffrey 
Wienckowski transplants the story to the 
Great Depression, allowing the Marxist 
criticisms of the capitalist world in the 
original to shed light on the American 
Dream.

The show opens in the shop of 
Jonathan Peachum (Zach Martens) — 
who leads and trains a group of beggars 
— as he notices that his daughter Polly 
(Taylor Shurte) has not come home since 
she went out the night before. Little does 
he know, she’s hooking up with, and 
planning on marrying (in a stable, of all 
places), criminal du jour Macheath, aka 
Mack the Knife (Zach Harrison).

Peachum is furious when he discov-
ers the news, and sets out to arrest Mack 
with the help of the sheriff, Tiger Brown 
(Mark Christine), getting caught up in 
manipulations along the way.

Meanwhile, betrayal lurks around 

every corner, and each colorful 
character is guilty of trickery. 
People use others for their own 
advantage. People use others for 
sexual pleasure. People use others 
for political means. And Mack the 
Knife uses others for everything

As the play progresses, we see 
Mack rise to the top.  He has men 
bowing at his feet, cops under his 
belt and is able to balance Polly as 
his lover, Lucy (Megan Robinson) as 
his old flame and Jenny (Anne Stella) 
as his hooker on the side. 

Despite the exciting plot-twists, 
Wienckowski’s two-and-a-half-hour                 
interpretation regrettably loses the 
sarcastic undertones of the original. 
Sarah Cogan’s dark lighting makes the 
characters appear more frightening than 
spiteful. Poorly choreographed, awk-
ward slap-stick jokes are inserted in an 
attempt to enhance the humor, though 
they mostly detract from the darkness of 
the plot. Other additions, like the rickety, 
ostensibly unfinished set and animated 
projections in the beginning make little 
significant contribution.  

The gifted cast puts on credible per-
formances nonetheless. As Polly, Shurte 
is the perfect innocent, playing well off 
Harrison’s debonair, mischievous Mack. 
Stella hits the right combination of 
seduction and arrogance playing Jenny, 
while the rest of the hookers — with 
their ditzy, nasally delivery — add a 
nice little touch to the story as a grown-
up interpretation of Cinderella’s evil 
stepsisters. 

But the lifeblood of the play is Weill’s 
exuberant music, boosted by jazzy chord 
progressions, light accordions and the 
melodramatic organ that embody the 
liveliness of the ’20s — if you’re famil-
iar with the Billie Holiday and Louis 
Armstrong renditions of “The Ballad of 
Mack the Knife,” you will enjoy the bril-
liantly performed version in the play. 

But for a show that claims to be for 
the corrupt thief, the cast and crew 
should have stolen more from the sim-
plicity of the Brecht original. New set-
tings and new ideas don’t always make a 
lasting impression.

Yes, the Winter Triton Festival has been postponed 
indefinitely (apparently Donald Glover is being a 
chump). But if you’re still in need of an excuse 
to cut loose this Saturday night, a hearty dose of 
good ‘ol Triton spirit has got you covered. Head

8ÊTHE UCSD GUARDIANÊ THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 2011Ê HIATUS

S tarting a new decade is always a drag. When I turned the big two-oh last week, I couldn’t help but 
feel remorse at leaving teenagedom 
behind. 

For a long time I held on to the 
precocious idea that, before my twen-

ties, I would write my magnum opus 
or discover my hidden talent for the 
didgeridoo, perform at Carnegie Hall 
and become world famous overnight. 
But forever gone is that window of 
opportunity to stake my claim at being 
a child prodigy and, in its place, I’ve 
been ringing in the new decade with 
wake-up calls from reality. Please, life, 
leave a message.

Ironically, one of the calls that I 
haven’t deferred to voicemail has me 
realizing how difficult the life of a 
child prodigy actually is. And, given 
the present hubbub of movie awards 
season, it’s only fair to pick on child 
actors. 

Instead of trekking up an incline 
in their stardom, child actors work to 
resist the inertia of a downhill career. 
The roles that put them on the map 
bank millions, making for records hard 
to trump and characters hard to erase 
from collective memory. Even those 
who defy the trend struggle at times. 
Case in point (despite the zeitgeist 
that would beg otherwise): Natalie 
Portman. 

She’s beautiful even when she goes 
bald and she’s versatile in her acting 
repertoire, too. Chicken-poxed guisha 
Queen Amidala scared me shitless 
as a kid, only to be outdone 11 years 
later by the spindly feathers that Nina 
sprouts from her back in “Black Swan.” 

But despite Portman’s beauty and 
the accolades that she’s accrued as one 
of our generation’s most brilliant star-
lets, I still feel underwhelmed and not 
wholly convinced by her more serious 
performances. Her expression of per-
manent constipation in “Black Swan” 
is a disappointing excuse for acting 
(and the Best Actress nomination), and 
those histrionic face contortions may 
very well be an effort at one-upping 
the dramatic performances she’s been 
churning out her entire career. 

Since her breakout role in 1994’s 
“The Professional,” Portman has largely 
remained in the dramatic film circuit, 
and, as her recent forays into comedy 
imply, Nina may be an extension of her 
very self. 

In other words, Portman has a 
“Black Swan” complex in reverse. 
Instead of going from the light to 
dark, she’s leaving dramatic chops 
behind for light-hearted humor in the 
just-released rom-com “No Strings 
Attached” and upcoming medieval 
stoner flick “Your Highness.” 

Although it’s certainly a departure 
from the norm she established in child-
hood, comedy agrees with Portman. 
Her rap on “SNL” in 2006 was ballsy 
but brilliant in playing off our expec-
tations (“When I was at Harvard / I 
smoked weed every day / I cheated 
every test / and snorted all the yay”). 
In 2009, she effortlessly kept pace with 
Zach Galifianakis’ awkward charac-
ter (and his greatest punch line) on 
his Funny or Die interview series, 
“Between Two Ferns.” 

Portman’s string of comedic mov-
ies isn’t the only thing in discord with 
the straight-laced image she spent her 
childhood building as a vegan, faith-
ful Jew and Ivy League graduate. Quite 
to the contrary, she’s soon to enjoy a 
shotgun wedding, after being knocked 
up by her choreographer, Benjamin 

Millipied (yes, you’re supposed to pro-
nounce it with French flair—“MEEL-
pee-yeh”—but I’m still thinking of the 
thousand-legged arthropod). 

Her interest in the risqué  (now so 
obvious that no flick of a Hollywood 
designer’s wand can cover her scarlet 
“A”) traces back to films as early as 
2004’s Academy-Award nominated 
“Closer,” where Portman played a strip-
per who told Clive Owen that her lady 
parts taste like heaven. 

What Portman has gone on record 
saying in the past about gratuitous 
nudity and sex in film has come back 
to bite her in the ass. “It’s horrible to 
be a sex object at any age, but at least 
when you’re an adult you can make the 
decision if you want to degrade your-
self,” she said a decade ago. 

So, either she’s being hypocriti-
cal or her Oscar acceptance speech 
this February will indirectly be an 
extension of thanks to Aronofsky for 
the opportunity to “degrade” her-
self in lesbian sex scenes with Mila 
Kunis. Or maybe it just wasn’t up to 
par with her extended nude scene in 
“Hotel Chevalier” or stripping down 
to a skimpy bikini in “Your Highness” 
before the glued eyes of James Franco 
and Danny McBride. 

Those accusations of hypocrisy and 
selling out are the inevitable price a 
child actor has to pay for her growing 
pains. The comparisons made between 
the current Portman and her ingénue 
past may be unfair, since she’s just 
breaking out of her childhood mold, 
but that’s what an adolescence spent in 
the limelight entails.

So, until I get my own big break, 
here’s to a new decade of screw-ups 
that won’t go publicly chastised (and 
hopefully a job when I graduate, too).

G o ahead and add underwater thriller “Sanctum” to a list of reasons never to go cave diving. The flick is based on the 
true story of an expert spelunker/diver who 
gets trapped with his team (and teenage son) 
in a mysterious cave that’s slowly filling with 

water. The team believes that 
somewhere below its feet, 
the cave water leads to the 
ocean, but they don’t have a 
map — or actual proof that 
the path exists. And with their 
entrance completely blocked, 
the only way out, as the tag-

line reads, is down. 
 “Sanctum” is another one of producer James 

Cameron’s epic explorations of picturesque nat-
ural landscapes: dwarfing, sparkling and utterly 
devoid of nuanced characters. There’s the gruff 
leading man Frank (Richard Roxburgh) and his 
rebellious son, Josh (Rhys Wakefield), cocksure 
Carl (Ioan Gruffudd of “The Fantastic Four”) 
and his bubble-gum Barbie girlfriend, Victoria 
(Alice Parkinson). Each is written as a cartoon-
ish caricature of a person and the effect is as 
stifling as the waterlogged cave they’re trapped 
in. Though some make admirable attempts 
at breaking through the movie’s entrapping 
screenplay (most notably the youngest cast 
member, Wakefield), others, like Gruffudd, 
resign themselves to cookie-cutter kitsch — 
Carl speaks with a forced, gum-bearing smile 
and calls his girlfriend “babe” in a mocking 
monotone. Like we haven’t heard that before.

Luckily, in true Cameron fashion, paint-
stripping dialogue takes a backseat to visual 
thrills. Director Alister Grierson keeps the 
audience in a state of near pitch-black suffoca-
tion as divers scramble to stay alive — avoiding 
jagged falling rocks, drowning or starvation. 
The striking scenery is doused with a shipload 
of visceral, teeth-grinding gore — actors hang 
precariously by their scalp-hair, scrape limbs 
against gritty stone and claw through wet, air-

tight cavities. 
In most films, 3-D effects are added after-

ward for the sake of charging an extra $3 at 
the box office. The practice usually results in 
a series of awkward close-ups — stills of golf 
balls rolling toward the audience, or Nic Cage’s 
CGI mug peering menacingly out of the screen 
(“The Green Hornet” is inexplicably playing in 
3-D right now). 

“Sanctum,” however, was actually conceived 
with 3-D technology in mind. Cameron has 
been developing and perfecting his own 3-D 
technology for years — his Fusion Camera 
System is being used to glorify lengthy, uninter-

rupted shots of the cave, rather than mimic the 
frivolous 3-D craze of the ’80s. The expansion 
of space allows the audience to experience the 
cave in all its spacious grandeur — sharpening 
layers of glistening rock, a corroding cathedral’s 
dilapidated walls and gushing bursts of unim-
peded water.

It’s likely that “Sanctum” will draw parallels 
to big-brother “Avatar,” though it also ham-
strings itself with a shriller cast of characters 
than the latter’s sag-faced ensemble.  And 
unfortunately for Cameron, it’s also bound 
to have a harder time keeping its head above 
water.

The best of electro riot grrrl band Le Tigre perfectly paired feminist 
lyrics with raw and fiery 
synth punk, turning weighty 
issues into songs that were 
always catchy as hell. 

Fortunately, side proj-
ect MEN, fronted by Le 
Tigre member JD Samson, 
is not much different. 
With the help of Michael 
ONeill (Princess, Ladybug 
Transistor) and Ginger 
Brooks Takahashi (LTTR, 
The Ballet), MENs debut, 
Talk About Body, blends Le 
Tigres radical roots with 
refined electronic beats and 
bass-lines straight from the 
disco sounds of Indeeps 
Last Night a DJ Saved My 
Life.   

Lifes Half Price starts 
the party right, as repetitive 
drums culminate in sweep-
ing guitar and a dance-floor 
breakdown. Samsons drawl 
is more monotone than the 
screech of Le Tigre front-
woman Kathleen Hanna, but 
by the end of the track she 
gives imitation a shot: Im 
not your babys daddy / Free 
love / Im not your babys 
daddy / free money! 

Samsons roots are partic-
ularly evident on tracks like 
Credit Card Babie$, where 
she offers advice on gay par-

enting that mostly amounts 
to suggesting adoption and 
borrowing someone elses 
cock. Like Le Tigre with its 
feminist focus, MEN makes 
it a point to show the strug-
gles gays have with adoption 
and the assumptions the 
heterosexual majority has on 
the subject.

But the music itself is not 
nearly as radical. Scattered 
with tribal drumming, tune-
ful guitar riffs and club beats, 
Talk About Body has Samson 
trying on everyone elses 
style instead of one that is 
distinctly her own. In tracks 
like Simultaneously, MEN 
even manage to borrow a 
couple of notes from the xxs 
signature whispery guitar 
and soft vocals. 

It would have served 
MEN better to craft an 
original style, rather than 
taking so heavily from past 
projects and contemporaries. 
Talk About Body weaves 
together raw punk and the 
synth drum patterns of disco, 
creating edgy buildups and 
therapeutic releases made for 
grooving. But MEN make no 
impact on the dance floor 
when they borrow so much 
from others and invent so 
little.

Electro-Pop Trio Borrows Disco 
Beats, Recycles Past Tricks

Theres no other way to put it: Tryptych, a collection of albums by Manchester 
duo Demdike Stare, is some 
seriously freaky shit. 

The band, which consists 
of minimalist techno innova-
tors Miles Whittaker and 
Sean Canty, spent the last 
year crafting three LPs worth 
of electronic music composed 
of samples from obscure 
sources: old film soundtracks, 
fuzzed-out Eastern European 
field recordings, Middle 
Eastern folk and 1980s 
Scandinavian industrial 
drone. 

For the most part, the 33 
songs collected on Tryptychs 
three albums  Forest of Evil, 
Liberation Through Hearing 
and Voices of Dust  fall 
into two categories. Theyre 
either atmospheric psyche-
delic music or repetitive and 
complex dub techno. Even for 
listeners that arent terribly 
well-versed in dark ambient 
music (dubbed hauntology 
by music blogs), its obvious 
that Demdike Stare know 
their stuff. 

On Forest of Evil (Dusk) 
 found on the first album 
 whispering voices and 
muddy static are overtaken 
by a relentless, arpeggiated 
synthesizer moan that sounds 
as though it was taken from 

the soundtrack to a long-
forgotten horror film. This 
approach is pushed to its limit 
on tracks like the standout 
Regolith, on which Baltic 
folk guitars are paired with 
unearthly female wails and a 
thundering bass drone.

Some of the most intrigu-
ing music on Tryptych is 
found on the albums more 
up-tempo tracks. The brood-
ing Bardo Thodol, named 
after the Tibetan Book of the 
Dead, begins with a sample 
taken from a dated field 
recording of a Central Asian 
folk group and evolves into a 
danceable techno groove. The 
similarly-minded Caged in 
Stammheim turns a lurch-
ing, reversed bass drum and 
female vocals into a hazy dub 
beat. 

Thats what makes 
Tryptych so interesting. The 
weirdest part of the album 
isnt the creepy cult-referenc-
ing spoken word samples or 
the early analog electronic 
experiments  its the fact 
that the results are oftentimes 
so accessible. 

Its still hard to get past 
the freaky, though: The more 
eccentric moments will scare 
you shitless.

Whitworth

Seattles Starbucks-folk collective Fleet Foxes will return this May with their highly anticipated second effort Helplessness Blues. Until then, the albums first single and title track 
provide enough plucking guitar, soaring melodies and wispy, 
Garfunkel-style vocals to satiate our thirst for those bucolic, 
hippie-bred simpler times. 

Helplessness Blues packs an impressive cinematic narra-
tive into five minutes. Frontman Robin Pecknold begins with a 
chorus-backed overture about youth and proving oneself, then 
picks up steam, erupting in an acoustic-driven chorus that chugs 
past lyrical images of waiting tables and working in orchards. 
Pecknold wields this aesthetic with emotive sincerity, following 
the musings of a twentysomething who feels helpless in a world 
of dizzying choices and consequences.

Clearly, Fleet Foxes plan to remain faithful to their breezy sta-
ple sound. The singles combination of stripped-down production 
and pleasant lyrical introspection provide hope for a solid return.

Lupe Fiasco is angry at the world, and hes not shy about it. Words I Never Said is five minutes of pure fury  an avalanche of lyrical broadsides aimed at everything from 
the bumbling media to shitty schools to Obama himself. 
After Skylar Grey opens the track with a hauntingly beauti-
ful verse sung over echoing keystrokes, Lupe immediately 
retorts, spitting such gems as, I really think the war on terror 
is a bunch of bullshit/ just a poor excuse for you to use up all 
your bullets.  

 Lupes venom spares no one and builds off a steady, pulsat-
ing beat that works with the chilling chorus to create a sense 
of doom. Its a virtuoso performance, more wrathful than past 
hits like Superstar or Day Dreaming, but just as packed 
with effortless wordplay and slick rhymes.

BASEBALL — Six All-Americans. Defensive 
Player of the Year. Coach of the Year. The acco-
lades rolled in by the dozens for UCSD baseball 
last year, but one accomplishment was just 
short of what the team was aiming for.

NCAA Division II Runners-Up.
The Tritons had their most successful year 

in program history in 2010, winning the CCAA 
title, NCAA West Regional Title and setting 
program records in wins, runs and team batting 
average. The squad set a total of 19 program 
records in 2010 including individual marks. 
The Tritons finished the season 54-8 and 
advanced to the NCAA Division-II title game. 

In his 14th year at the helm, UCSD alum 
Dan O’Brien is by far the program’s most suc-
cessful coach. O’Brien was awarded his second 
consecutive Division II Coach of the Year last 
season, and has led his squad to back-to-back 
D-II College World Series appearances.

This year, the senior-laden squad has every 
chance of returning to the heights of last sea-
son, and is the early-season contender for the 
national title. The team was the unanimous 
coaches’ pick to take the CCAA title again, 
and ranked No. 2 nationally in the Division-II 
preseason coaches’ poll. Southern Indiana, who 
defeated the Tritons 6-4 in the 2010 Title Game, 
begins the season with the top ranking.

The Tritons return with many of the top 
players from last year’s squad, and look poised 
to make another run to the College World 
Series in Cary, N.C. Ace Tim Shibuya returns, 
and will look to continue his dominating form 
from last year. The senior produced a school 
record of 13 wins with a 13-3 overall record, 
struck out 77 batters in 124 innings and threw 
five complete games. Fellow senior right-hand-
er Guido Knudson also returns, after going 
10-3 with a 3.87 ERA and four complete games 
last year.

In the field, the Tritons return six starters, 
with third baseman Evan Kehoe leading the 
way. The senior hit .351 last season, with eight 
home runs and 63 RBIs. Left fielder Aaron 
Bauman also returns after leading the team 
with a .553 OBP last season, while hitting .413 
with eight home runs. Fellow returning starters 
Kyle Saul, Aaron Bauman, Kellen Lee, Danny 
Susdorf, Michael Benton and Grant Bauer 
provide a fearsome lineup for any opposing 
pitching staff. 

But the Tritons have some significant 
holes to fill. All-Americans Vance Albitz and 
Brendan Gregorich have departed, along with 
starting pitchers Matt Rossman and Kirby St. 
John. Gregorich set a school record by hitting 
a ridiculous .452 last season, and Albitz won 
consecutive Defensive Player of the Year awards 
from his shortstop position. 

“As far as position players, yeah we lost 
two or three guys but we have six guys coming 
back,” Kehoe said. “It’s good to see younger 
guys fit in. You can look at it two ways: You can 

say they have some holes to fill, or you can say 
they have six guys returning and they’re just 
going to be even better.”

Last season, Rossman and St. John com-
bined for a 21-1 record on 199.1 innings 
pitched, and the Tritons will need to find a way 
to fill their spots in the rotation. Righty Daniel 
Simmons and lefty Taylor Austin appear set to 
step up.

“I think our pitching staff is deeper than 
it’s ever been,” Kehoe said. “Just watching our 
staff the first two games, they’ve been amazing. 
They’ve been dominating the other teams.”

But the Tritons have more than just person-
nel change this year. Over the offseason, the 
team and the UCSD Athletics Department 
embarked on a campaign to have lights installed 
at Triton ballpark, and — thanks to a slew of 
donations from alumni — were able to have the 
lights installed in January, in time for the 2011 
season. The lack of lighting disqualified UCSD 
from hosting playoff games in the past, even 
when the squad should have hosted based on 
record and ranking.

The Tritons hosted their first night game on 
Saturday, Jan. 29 in an exhibition game against 
Point Loma Nazarene. Over 250 attended the 
“Light It Up” celebration before the game, with 
former player Sean Greer flipping the switch to 
light the field.

“It’s just a huge occasion,” Kehoe said. “It’s 
kind of a watershed moment for our program. 
It’s been one of our goals for a few years now. I 
didn’t really think it would manifest itself until 
after I was gone. It just shows that our program 
is headed in the right direction.”

The growth didn’t come without growing 
pains: The lights were on a timer and shut off 
promptly at 10 p.m. in the middle of the ninth 
inning. Facing a 15-minute warm-up time to 
get the lights back on and playing only an exhi-
bition, the game was called short.

Nevertheless, O’Brien agreed that the lights 
mean a lot to the program.

“It was an electric night,” O’Brien said. “It 
was just an incredible night — from the alumni, 
the place was packed, the music was loud, 
everyone was having a great time. It was a really 
special night.”

On the field, the Tritons defeated Point 
Loma 5-0. 

“This was the first time where you could see 
the team start to realize how good they could 
be,” O’Brien said. “I think things are starting to 
fall into place.”

UCSD has won all three of its preseason 
exhibition games, with 2-1 and 3-2 wins over 
San Diego Christian College.
