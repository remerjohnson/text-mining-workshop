UC  SYSTEM

Teaching Assistants had 
planned on striking to  
protest unfair labor practices 
between June 7 to 17.

BY  jacky to
staff Writer

The UCSD Graduate Student Association voted to decertify the Che Cafe from its co-operative 
status on Monday evening with a vote 
of 24–2–3.

This is the second time the GSA 
has decertified the Che Cafe due to 
its alleged failure to comply with 
the Master Space Agreement, a 2006 
contract between UCSD and all of its 
“Co-ops”; the first time was in 2012.

Public input regarding the 
decertification of the Che Cafe was 
limited to one minute and was extended 

to three minutes. Revelle College senior 
and Co-op Union representative Josh 
Kenchel was the only proponent of the 
Che Cafe that spoke.

After Kenchel spoke, a procedural 
vote was made to close debate on the 
issue, but it did not pass, and a few more 
minutes were allotted to discussing why 
the GSA proposed closing the Che Cafe. 

GSA president Rahul Kapadia said 
the motion to decertify the Che Cafe 
again resulted from the Che failing to 
adhere to components of the Master 
Space Agreement, such as paying rent.

The labor union United Auto 
Workers, which represents the 
UC system’s  teaching assistants, 
tutors and readers, cancelled plans 
to enact a statewide strike as a 
result of reaching a settlement with 
the UC administration. The union 
announced the strike cancellation 
on June 3 on its Facebook page 
and that it would be gathering the 
next day to discuss the agreements 
openly.

The strike previously was 
planned to take place between June 
7 and June 17 and was meant to be 
a response to the UC administra-
tion allegedly engaging in a series of 
unfair labor practices.

Over the past few months, the 
UAW had filed multiple Unfair 
Labor Practice charges with the 
state Public Employment Relations 
Board, alleging that the UC man-
agement had arrested members for 
picketing, torn down union posters, 
threatened members with reprisal, 
insisted that the strikes were illegal 
and docked pay out of proportion 
to the labor withheld during the 
strikes. 

Before the settlement was 
reached, UCnet posted an article 
answering frequently asked ques-
tions about the strike. It says that 
the charges include allegations that 
“UC intimidated employees when 
supervisors asked certain employ-
ees if they planned to come to work 
during UAW’s April strike.” It also 
states that the university “disagrees 
with the UAW’s allegations that UC 
did anything wrong” and that the 
UC asked if they planned on strik-
ing or working for “academic plan-
ning purposes.”

The actual Unfair Labor 
Practices file, which articulates all 
the charges, however, explained that 
failing to respond to the question 
would result in employers conclud-
ing that a worker was participating 
in the strike. This caused employees 
to feel like they had to respond 
to the poll and intimidated some 
employees from participating in the 
strike as they understood that their 
employer was keeping tabs on who 
did and did not intend to strike. The 
file claimed that this created “an 
intimidating and coercive environ-
ment for graduate students in the 
bargaining unit.”

The UCnet article also states that 
the Unfair Labor Practices charges 
alleged “that UC did not pay some 
teaching assistants for days they did 
not work while participating in the 
strike.” The actual ULP, on the other 
hand, charged that some members 
were docked pay out of proportion

CALIFORNIA

State Assembly Members Announce 
Plan to Restrict Access to Firearms
If passed, the bill will allow law enforcement to investigate individuals after “loved ones” 
alert authorities to suspicious behavior. Currently, authorities can only act if alerted by a 
health professional.

On May 27, assembly members 
Das Williams and Nancy Skinner 
announced plans to introduce a bill 
that, if passed, will allow authorities 
to investigate and potentially restrict 
individuals at risk of committing vio-
lence from possessing firearms.

The announcement was made 
following the recent Isla Vista 
shootings in the Santa Barbara com-
munity. The bill is set to go on the 
California Senate floor later this 
month. According to Williams, the 
bill will stipulate that law enforce-
ment can investigate individuals 
after being alerted to their suspi-
cious behavior by a “loved one.”

“At this point, the only one who 
can initiate something that can legally 
bind something of this kind is a health 
professional,” Williams told the UCSD 
Guardian. “The fact is that a loved one 
can recognize red flags about what’s 
going on with a potentially violent 
individual, especially if they are not 
seeking mental help.”

Additionally, Williams said the 
greatest impact of the bill, if passed, 
would be suicide prevention.

“Depression is common among 
young adults,” Williams said. “This bill 
could have prevented what happened 
at Isla Vista and, if approved, will pre-
vent suicide more than anything.”

Williams also said that, if passed, 
the bill would not directly impact uni-
versities and colleges.

“The bill will not provide fund-

ing for more counseling services,” 
Williams said. “I hope students will 
urge their legislators and senators 
to vote on it and also to help create 
more community on campus because 
legislation can’t solve everything; we 
also need to be treating each better as 
human beings.”

University of California Office 
of the President Media Specialist 
Shelly Meron said that 24/7 sup-
port services were made available to 
students in response to the Isla Vista 
shootings.

“Classes were canceled at UC 
Santa Barbara on May 27 to allow the 
campus time to reflect and mourn, 
and a campus memorial service was 
held that same day,” Meron said. 
“Counseling services were imme-

“The main issue we have is that 
the Che Cafe is still not paying the 
rent and is still in violation of a lot 
of things,” Kapadia said. “What we 
want from the university by passing 
this resolution is the decertification 
and termination of the lease.”

In addition, Kapadia said that 
the motion was not passed to satisfy 
GSA interests but to satisfy those of 
the student body.

“It’s not a question of GSA’s benefit. 
The idea is that UCSD students don’t 
care about the co-ops, especially the 
Che,” Kapadia said.  “A lot of [University 
Center]’s revenues are going to the Che 
Cafe, and we don’t feel it’s a good use of 

student fees.”
However, Kenchel asserted 

the motion would not affect the 
co-operative.

“They already want to move the 
Che to an office and make it not a 
part of the Master Space Agreement, 
but this resolution didn’t do that. 
It just recommended the move,” 
Kenchel said. “And nothing is going 
to change with University Centers 
because we’re going to negotiate 
with [UCEN] directly.”

Furthermore, Kenchel said the 
Che Cafe was indeed paying its 
rent and reducing its debt to the 
university. He also said the motion 
to decertify the Che Cafe again was 
discussed prior to the vote without 

the Che Cafe’s knowledge.
“Two weeks ago, the GSA voted 

on this without letting any of [the 
Che Cafe] know or anything,” 
Kenchel said. “Then I sent an email 
saying they should’ve included 
us in the decision, and then they 
organized the meeting this week.”

With regards to the Master 
Space Agreement, Kapadia said the 
university violated the contract by not 
terminating the Che Cafe’s lease before.

“If the university had followed 
the Master Space Agreement four 
years ago, the Che Cafe would have 
been terminated [then],” he said. 

to the labor withheld during the 
strike. 

The Unfair Labor Practices 
charges also states that “the amount 
that was deducted from their pay-
checks does not coincide with the 
amount of time the University 
alleges they missed from work.” 

They charge that “it is clearly meant 
to be coercive, intimidating and as 
retaliation for having participated 
in the strike.” UCnet did not men-
tion or address these allegations in 
its article. 

The UAW composed and emailed 
its own FAQ to union members on 
May 29. The FAQ explains that the 
union originally chose to hold the 

strike during Finals Week so as to 
not interfere with student learning. 
However, it urged members to with-
hold all responsibilities during the 
strike, including grading, entering 
grades, proctoring exams and hold-
ing office hours.

Council Talks Plans for Campus 
Food Bank and UCAB Deficit

Hey, Tritons!
During the member reports, 

MOVES Director Kyle Heiskala dis-
cussed transportation and said that he 
wants to focus the biking commission 
on developing an effective bike-shar-
ing program.

“It would be student-run and can 
be used to go to and from campus,” 
Heiskala said. “I’d 
like to expand that 
with local apart-
ment complex 
owners to create 
bike sharing loca-
tions, as well as the local community  
stores, food marts [and] UTC.”

Advocate General Colin King 
directed the meeting to special pre-
sentations where Dean of Affairs Patty 
Mahaffey discussed “food insecurities” 
on UCSD’s campus.

Fourteen percent of UCSD stu-
dents answered in a survey that they 
“often to very often” skip meals to 
save money, and individual students 
have also reached out to Mahaffey 
about going hungry as well. Due to 
this, Mahaffey wants to develop a food 
bank on campus, where food can be 
distributed to students.

New University Centers Advisory 
Board Chair Claire Maniti then hosted 
a presentation on student budget fees 
and the current deficit.

According to Maniti’s presenta-
tion, UCSD is currently in a $491,000 
deficit, and this is due to three reasons: 
inflation, enrollment and deferred 
maintenance. UCAB’s previous ref-
erendums had not accounted for 
inflation, and up until the 2014¬–15 
academic year, UCSD’s student enroll-
ment had been relatively stable and 
hit a plateau; therefore, UCAB does 
not have any additional funds to put 
toward the reserves. To slim down 
budgets, the administration had 
deferred maintenance which led to 

financial issues as well.
Maniti explained that by the 2015–

16 academic year, the UCEN reserves 
will be at 0 dollars.

“The situation is pretty dire, [and] 
UCAB is looking at different refer-
endums for solutions,” Maniti said. 
“[This] will be about being incred-
ibly proactive and reaching out to as 

many communities 
as possible.”

UCAB is look-
ing at different 
areas in the student 
budget to increase 

fees. If the reserves do hit zero, then 
UCSD will be running at minimal 
operations. Some of the repercussions 
could be that the Loft might poten-
tially be shut down, lighting in the 
University Centers could be decreased 
while space and hours could also be 
reduced for A.S. Council.

Student Fee Advisory Committee 
Chair Sammy Chang held a presenta-
tion on the A.S. budget, discussing 
how salaries, stipends, student orgs 
and UCSD traditional events will have 
to be continuously funded by A.S. 
Council. Chang said that Council will 
have to decide how to allocate a certain 
amount of money each year to fund 
those events and programs.

“This is something that’s critical for 
students, and if we’re not able to get 
that and if we’re going to keep having 
to dip into reserves, that’s going to be 
a problem,” Chang said. “When our 
reserves become zero [it will] be an 
embarrassment [for] A.S.”

I would like to personally thank 
Sammy Chang for all the hard work 
and immense changes he has brought 
to this campus. I wish you all the best 
in your future, Sammy, and hope that 
if the UCEN reserves do hit zero, 
you’ll be on speed dial. Good luck with 
finals, Tritons, and may everyone have 
a warmth-filled summer!

Suicide Prevention Programs Offered at UCSD Through CAPS

diately made available around the 
clock to UCSB students, faculty and 
staff who needed support.”

One of the resources available 
to students is the Counseling and 
Psychological Services Wellness Peer 
Educator Program, which educates 
students about mental health and 
wellness to reduce stigma and spread 
awareness of CAPS on campus. 
Additionally, participants of the Peer 

Educator Program are trained in 
basic counseling skills, group facili-
tation, crisis management and ethics 
and are taught how to construct and 
implement outreach and workshop 
presentations.

Muir College sophomore Sarah 
Feteih is a member of the Peer 
Education Program and has par-
ticipated in a suicide prevention 
workshop and said students help 
their peers by connecting them to 
resources such as CAPS. 

“A lot of times people are just 
reaching out for help, so being able to 
recognize that and being the person 
who is there for them can really make 
a difference,” Feteih said. “Also, even 
though you may not know what to do 
to help as an individual, knowing the 
resources that exist and letting people 
know how to get help can make a sig-
nificant impact.”

From humble beginnings to 
overnight stardom, the award-
winning musical “Jersey Boys,” 
following the success of rock ’n’ 
roll band The Four Seasons and 
their inevitable dissolution, is 
now coming to theaters. In the hit 
musical, the band members narrate 
the story: There’s the debt-laden 
guitarist Tommy DeVito (Vincent 
Piazza), talented songwriter Bob 

Gaudio (Erich Bergen), jaded bass-
ist Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) 
and lead singer Frankie Valli (John 
Young), each giving their own take 
of the band’s career. Whether a 
movie adaptation will focus on the 
original Broadway format of switch-
ing narrators or utilize an omniscient 
perspective, there’s still the allure of 
a riveting plot and catchy musical 
numbers — that rocketed to success 
in an album — reinvented by the cast. 
With critically acclaimed director 
Clint Eastwood directing and Young 
reprising his original Broadway role, 
there’s already a high bar set. 

Richard Linklater’s newest 
drama, “Boyhood,” contains no CGI 
effects, setting it at odds with the 
blockbusters this year. Yet despite 
this lack of computer-generated 
imagery, it’s the most technically 
impressive marvel on display this 
summer due to its staggering 12-
year span of filming; Shooting com-
menced in 2002 and only wrapped 
up last year.

But it’s not merely for bragging 
rights. Featuring newcomer Ellar 
Coltrane — only seven years old 

when filming started — “Boyhood” 
utilizes his natural growth and 
aging over those years to craft a life-
like bildungsroman about a Texan 
boy’s bewildering journey through 
childhood and adolescence.

The film promises to combine 
Linklater’s signature transforma-
tion of everyday monotony into the 
sublime, perfected in “Dazed and 
Confused,” with the impeccable 
dialogue he’s written for his “Before 
Sunrise” film trilogy. Considering 
the unanimous praise from critics 
at Sundance, “Boyhood” could be 
the film to finally garner Linklater 
an Oscar. 

After moving from Britain to Manhattan so her 
longtime boyfriend Dave (Adam Levine) could land a 
major record deal, Gretta (Keira Knightley) is devas-
tated when he breaks up with her in the midst of his 
fame. While singing about the breakup, she catches 
the attention of a dejected music executive named Dan 
(Mark Ruffalo). “Begin Again” follows their charming 
musical collaboration.

Knightley’s thin, wispy voice will nicely complement 
the folky songs written for the film. “Begin Again” will also 
mark the beginning of Levine’s risky venture into acting. 
But his character is so meta (in fact, he compares Dave to 
himself seven years ago) that hopefully little effort is needed 
from him.

Originating from the same director (John Carney) as 
“Once,” the film is in danger of rehashing similar material, 
particularly the musical partnership narrative between 
Ruffalo and Knightley. However, “Begin Again” will serve as 
another example of Carney’s greatest strength: his marriage 
of visuals and music.

He was hailed as the godfather of soul, Mr. Dynamite 
and the hardest working man in show business, but if you 
asked him, he was just James Brown. Chadwick Boseman 
(“42”) will take center stage in the upcoming biopic about 
the musical legend, directed by Tate Taylor (“The Help”). 

Many know about the flamboyant showman, but “Get On 
Up” provides an opportunity for the world to discover the 
prejudice and inner demons tormenting the man un-
derneath the cape. Boseman has the raspy voice and the 
pompadour hair down, but if he really wants to do justice 
to the role, he will have to give his all. That is the epitome of 
Brown himself: a human dynamo who employed charisma 
and killer dance moves to create a persona like no other. 
Hopefully his story will radiate the same energy his life did 
because he would have appreciated a good show.

It’s no secret that Lasse Hallstrom is a foodie. 
Best known for directing the quirky “Chocolat,” 
Hallstrom brings audiences back to French kitchens 
in the adaptation of Richard C. Morais’ bestseller. 
“The Hundred-Foot Journey” follows Madame Mal-
lory (Helen Mirren), a chef who runs her restaurant 
with an iron fist, as she faces competition from a 
Franco-Indian family of talented chefs.

Despite its predictable storyline, “Journey” will 
undoubtedly deliver gentle poignancy dusted with 
a teaspoon of warm wit. Hallstrom is no stranger 
to this recipe, as seen in the heart-warming “Hachi: 
A Dog’s Tale” and “Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.” 
In case there was any doubt, “Journey” will be just 
as charming and thought provoking, as the film is 
produced by pathos-lovers Steven Spielberg, Oprah 
Winfrey and Juliet Blake of TED Talks.

But if a charming comfort film and food porn 
isn’t enough to whet your appetite, perhaps the 
chance to hear Mirren’s rich French accent will.

Luc Besson, director of the iconic 
“The Fifth Element,” is bringing 
another superhuman heroine to the 
big screen. Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) 
becomes an unwilling drug mule 
when a gang surgically implants a 
package into her abdomen. When 
she’s beaten by a guard, the package 
rips open and the mysterious drug 
seeps into her system. The drug 
allows her to access more than 10 

percent of her brain’s capacity, giving 
her super powers and little mercy. 
With each passing minute that Lucy 
grows more incredible, she also loses 
more of her humanity. It’s a thought-
provoking angle to take, though it 
may prevent audiences from truly 
connecting with the hero. However, 
Johansson’s Black Widow from “The 
Avengers” proves she can make an 
action protagonist compelling. As the 
audience watches Lucy shoot her way 
to vengeance, it will grapple with the 
impending question of what happens 
when Lucy can access 100 percent of 
her brain.

With each new release from 
writer and director Woody Allen, 
Hollywood does its best to safeguard 
any and all information pertaining to 
the movie during production. 

What is currently known about 
Allen’s latest oeuvre, “Magic in the 
Moonlight,” is that it centers on 
an Englishman trying to expose 
a hoax. Set on the French Riviera 
during the 1920s, Colin Firth plays 
said Englishman in typical Firth-
ian fashion — he is endearing, 

awkward and very English — sent 
to investigate the work of a beguil-
ing socialite and alleged spirit 
medium (Emma Stone). 

At the moment, Allen’s perpet-
ual veil of secrecy still covers most 
of the plot, but he has hinted at a 
love story unraveling against the 
backdrop of the Cote d’Azur with 
its mansions, fancy cars, jazz clubs 
and Gatsby-esque parties. Just like 
his other wanderlust-inducing 
works “Midnight in Paris” and “To 
Rome With Love,” the film will 
inspire travel, adventure and love.

Could “Guardians of the Galaxy” — with its (liter-
ally) out-of-this-world setting, campy tone and kooky 
cast — be Marvel Studios’ first flop? Probably not — 
Bradley Cooper’s feisty, raccoon-fighting aliens with a 

tree-like sidekick (Vin Diesel) should already warrant 
a blockbuster.

At first glance, the eponymous Guardians seem 
to be the galactic Avengers. After stealing a powerful 
but mysterious orb, our borderline anti-hero Peter 
Quill (Chris Pratt) recruits a ragtag group of fight-
ers to save the universe from the ruthless Ronan (Lee 
Pace). Pratt’s comic timing will be on par with Robert 
Downey Jr.’s, and Pace will bring as much, if not more, 
formidability to his antagonist as Tom Hiddleston did 
to Loki. But Marvel is never one for rehashing mate-
rial. Bolder, brasher and edgier, the film is a testament 
to the studio’s confidence to push its franchise to 
greater heights.

“Guardians” might not be another “Avengers,” but 
we’ll all still be hooked on a feeling. (Ooga-chaka.)

“Uhhh Toto ... we’re for sure not in 
Hollywood anymore.”

The best way to describe working 
at the UCSD Guardian is “you had 
to be there.” I could sit here and 
dutifully explain every moment of 
insane joy I felt after scaring Zev with 
a life-size Ron Burgandy cardboard 
cutout. I could describe about every 
Wednesday afternoon migraine, every 
morning bagel taken from “Schmooze 
with the Jews,” every time I nearly 
peed my pants from an inappropriate 
joke, every fancy bracket and every 
time I yelled at someone for using 
the golf cart because they were too 
lazy to walk to Goody’s. Without the 
Guardian, I would lack any hirable 
skills, knowledge of AP Style, life-long 
friends, a couple enemies and even an 
ex. I could explain all of this in great 
detail but it would be a waste of time. 
For even I cannot edit my words to 
effectively narrate my time here; you 
simply had to be there.

Angela, Margaret and Arielle: 
It blows my mind that the most 
experienced current staff doesn’t know 
how much you three ladies have done 
for the G. They don’t know about 
seppuku, our obsession with KBBQ 
or even Guardian Vegas. I wouldn’t 
be where I am nor have the ability 
to scare someone shitless by typing 
rapidly while maintaining eye contact 
if it weren’t for strong lady journalists 
like you. You taught me so much. 

Allie: I’m so happy I complimented 
your baked goods at your very first 
Thanksgiving. If it weren’t for that 
brief moment, you never would have 
become my confidante, first lieutenant 
and lexa-bro. Let’s tear shit up next 
year, okay? (And by shit, I mean 
various San Diego publications.) Now 
that we have the time. 

Rachel: Thank you for not 
graduating on time. Seriously, if you 
left when you were supposed to, no 
one would understand my references 
to our grim past. No one would even 
be old enough to grab our traditional 
weekly beer at the pub. And no 

one would understand the trials and 
tribulations of (not) having a dating 
life while working for the newspaper.

Andrew, Brian, Taylor, Alwin: 
Your job was to make the paper look 
good and even make me look good 
on occasion. You did a fantastic job. 
Andrew, never stop celebrating the 
penis. Brian, it really did end up being 
okay. Taylor, you made my senior 
sendoff dreams come true! Thanks for 
your friendship and expert lighting.

The news girls: You took on the 
hardest job on staff and rocked it. I 
can’t wait to see what you do next ... as 
long as it doesn’t involve fainting. 

Flavia: As if spending every waking 
moment with you wasn’t already 

enough, having you around the office 
just made life even sweeter. You’ve 
become such a talented designer in a 
short amount of time. You never cease 
to impress me. 

Keita: Thanks for helping us delve 
into something new and exciting. 
Thanks for always letting me have 
another take when I talked too fast on 
camera.

My guardian babies: When I first 
became EIC, it seemed as if everyone 
was dropping like flies. People were 
quitting, graduating and some just 
stopped answering my emails. And 
then a fresh crop of eager journalists 
came in and made work a bit easier 
and a lot more fun. You have all come 

so far. I can’t wait to lurk your Issuu 
account and see how you’ve made the 
Guardian better. Your presence in the 
office always made me smile. Good 
luck and remember I’m just an email 
away.

And of course Zev: Chamol Gadol. 
Motek. My shining Jewish star. Thank 
you for writing editorials when I didn’t 
want to. Thank you for knowing this 
school inside and out. And thank you 
for not being scared to stand up to me. 
You may have frustrated me to no end 
but you made me be a better boss. You 
truly bring out the crazy Israeli in me 
and for that I say toda raba. I am so 
proud of you. Even if someone did end 
up running against you, I still would 

have wanted you as my successor. <3
Emily: I mean this in the nicest 

way possible: Get out of here already! 
You’re the real backbone of this whole 
operation. I’m so thankful you didn’t 
leave before my term ended because 
let’s be honest ... I don’t think I was 
ever going to learn to balance a budget 
as well as you.

To the entire staff and all the 
people I likely forgot: Being editor-
in-chief is absolutely useless without 
the support and fantastic writing, 
advertisements, art, copy edits and 
designs provided by all of you. You 
rock, don’t ever change. KIT. HAGS 
and all that good stuff.

The first lesson I learned at the UCSD Guardian 
was to speak up. When I began working for the 
Guardian, my editor was incredibly kind and went 
around introducing me to everyone in the office, but 
for some unknown reason, she told everyone my 
name was “Maddy” — a nickname I’ve never cared 
for.  My failure to correct her that first day has led 
the nickname to stick, and to this day, the Guardian 
staff is the only group on campus that calls me by 
that name.

I have been a part of the Guardian since Zero 
Week of my freshman year. The Opinion Editor at 
the time said she had to hire me after seeing that I 
had the audacity to include literal toilet humor in 
my sample article (“As I hovered over the seat with 
the skill of an Olympic gymnast,” I said). To put 
in perspective how long I’ve been on the paper, I 
was there when our office was located in the now-
Veterans Resource Center, all writers were paid and 
edits were done on paper instead of Google Docs.

It’s the culture at the Guardian that has kept 
me here. It’s a culture of intelligent banter, constant 
shenanigans and mutual suffering. Working on 
the Guardian has been the hardest work I’ve ever 
done — the long hours, the endless workload, the 
pressure of knowing that any mistake you make 
will be printed thousands of times.  I started out 
as a columnist, with my Greek life column series 
being republished and recognized by the UCSD 
PanHellenic Council. Then I became Opinion 
Editor, where I discovered my passion for editing 
and the sad reality that readers like to write me 
really angry letters.

Yet I honestly never got burned out and 
continued on to be Managing Editor and Training 
and Development Manager. The Pokemon card of 
me on the wall listed my attacks as “optimism” and 
“spontaneous singing,” and I’m pretty sure those 

were the keys to my sanity. Though I’ve decided 
to pursue a different career than journalism, 
the Guardian is the one that brought me to this 
point. The Guardian has gotten me every job I’ve 
had, it allowed me to visit Israel to meet John 
Kerry and it got me into a University of Southern 
California Master’s program. I’ve learned so much 
about management, teamwork, motivation and 
relationship building from the Guardian — far more 
than any of my classes have taught me.

The people at the Guardian are exceptional, with 
everyone passionate, quick witted and as bizarre 
as all get-out. To Margaret: You are my Marg in 
Charge, you taught me so much and you are my 
favorite person to hug who doesn’t hug me back. 
To Nathan Toung: I loved every production that 
we spent laughing and singing together, and you 
actually made me look forward to my calculus 
homework. To Brian for your thoughtfulness and 
amazing puns. To Zev for always fueling the fire of 
shenanigans and never being afraid to wear women’s 
clothing. To Lauren and Kelvin for your incredible 
reign of the opinion dynasty. To Ren and Arielle 
for our legendary time as the managing team. To 
Brad Segal, whose enthusiastic texts at 2 a.m. about 
column ideas reminded me why I simultaneously 
love Greek life and being an editor. To Jeffrey Lau 
for being on the ball when I would forget to send 
in art requests. To Allie, Dorothy and Vincent for 
always putting me in a great mood. 

And finally to Andrew Oh: Though you would 
prank me and hide my computer case, you made up 
for it in your support of my music and aspirations. 
Thank you for being an amazing friend.

The Guardian was my college experience, and 
I will miss you so much. I’m freaking out a bit, but 
I guess that’s how you know the future is really 
happening.

I joined the UCSD Guardian for the same 

reason I do many other things: guilt. My aunt, 
a high school journalism adviser, had already 
emailed her paper’s former editor-in-chief 
— who was the incoming news editor at the 
Guardian — telling him that I was planning 
on applying to be a copy editor, that I was very 
passionate about editing, that he should keep 
an eye on me. It was mostly wishful thinking 
on her part. Applying was disconcertingly easy; 
I had to fill out a one-page, fill-in-the-blank 
application and take a copy test. An email a 
week later told me I was hired and gave me 
four hours a week in shifts.

The hours added up. I’m not sure when I 
got sucked in. Maybe it was when Angela and 
Margaret laughed in approval of my Arrested 
Development reference. Maybe it was when I 
spent a full Sunday at Starbucks editing articles 
with Claire. Maybe it was at the Guardian 
Thanksgiving party when Laira told me she was 
glad when new people stuck around or when 
Emily told me about stories from the Guardian 
she knew. Maybe it was the time spent 
brooding with Ruda about depression-themed 
book clubs we’d never start. Maybe it was 
planning — though never executing — Arielle’s 
Not Mitzvah, or when Arielle, Zev, Rebecca, 
Ren, Madeline and I stayed at production ‘til 
2 a.m. for divestment vote results to come in, 
only to see the vote postponed because Price 
Center security had to leave. I remember 
running from the Old Student Center to an 
already-closed Burger King to get Zev a diet 
soda to drink while he rewrote the entire 
divestment article. I felt like a hero. I returned 
with the soda; Zev told me I’d make a great 
intern one day.

And then I got to watch others get sucked 
in like I did. I was lucky to see it happen with 
many. I watched Rachel pore through the final 

InDesign files pre-upload, making sure every 
single email byline was accurate, that no text 
was overset, ignoring my cries that it wasn’t 
her job to do. I watched Sydney and Soumya 
rewrite a Graffiti Hall article last-minute. I 
watched Dorothy change design color schemes 
rapidly enough to make someone seize and 
hold an hours-long, out-of-production meeting 
with Brandon just to plan a killer sports 
feature, insulting her own ability all the way. I 
watched Andrew grow from the kid who wrote 
joke comments on a copy test to one who sent 
out shift-scheduling Doodles. I watched Gabby 
take interview notes with a broken wrist and 
give up a Thursday evening to hang out with 
her team of news writers and chat over pho. 
I watched Lauren struggle to let go of the 
opinion section and realize that as a leader, she 
had to see the Guardian far more holistically.

I joined the Guardian out of guilt, but love 
made me stay. I’m not sure I know where the 
love came from, or when, but most reassuring 
is the feeling that so many others love or care 
about it too, albeit in different amounts and in 
different ways. There are probably more who 
care in ways I’ll never know or understand, 
but here are some that I do: Those who care 
about the business side, about advertising 
and marketing (bit.ly/guardiansurvey), about 
old-school print distribution, those who brave 
the terrifying prospect of going digital, those 
who care who care because of journalism, 
who find the stories, write them, design them, 
photograph, copy read, illustrate. And then 
there are those who read the Guardian. I hope 
you read something interesting. If you didn’t, 
I hope you tell us about the interesting stuff 
that we’re missing. And I also hope you’re not 
disappointed that it’s Thursday and there’s a 
Sudoku in this issue, not a crossword. Pick up a 
copy next fall. It’ll be on page 10.

I joined the UCSD Guardian 
as a young design minion of the 
fabulously-talented Leo Q. Bui. As 
an unpaid graphic designer, I literally 
started from the bottom. Though 
many people might not know this, 
designers actually have one of the 
most difficult jobs. We come in every 
production day (twice a week), stay 
late (sometimes past midnight), 
are constantly solving problems, 
re-doing designs that took hours 
to make and tweaking every little 
detail our editors desired. By now 
you’re probably thinking, why would 
anyone want to do this (and for 
little/or no money too)? 

Though it might sound like one 
of the worst jobs, it’s by far the most 
rewarding. And as cliche as it sounds, 
the Guardian became my on-campus 
family. I met some of my best friends 
at the Guardian, people who get my 
sarcastic humor (or at least put up 
with it). Now I’d like to say that the 
beautiful designs you’ve witnessed for 
the past two years were all me, but 
that would be the furthest thing from 
the truth. 

First off, I wouldn’t be half the 
designer I am today without Leo’s 
teachings — and by that I mean not 
being afraid to tell me, “Sara that 
looks hideous. Don’t ever do that 
again.” I honestly learned so much 
from watching him work, and I really 

don’t think I would care half as much 
about picas if it wasn’t for him. 

As design editor, I would have 
been lost without my mob. Thanks 
Dorothy, Zoe, Amber and Lauren 
(#babydesigner) for the crew love. 
The design room wouldn’t be the 
same without you guys, our bizarre 
conversations that people regret 
walking in on, kawaii Wednesdays 
(which we did twice), Fairbanks coffee 
and, of course, Drake. I’ll never forget 
those long days of making everything 
fit, kearning to -25px and hoping no 
one notices and, of course, cutting out 
Harry Styles’s head and attaching it to 
Miley’s naked body. 

I would also like to thank Emily 
Ku for always being open to chat 
about design editor struggles, for 
the invaluable advice, and, most 
importantly, for the B-parking spot. 
Because of you, nothing was the 
same.

And to the rest of the Guardian, 
thank you guys for giving me the 
best college experience a girl could 
ask for. I’ll never forget all the 
great people I met, the Guardian 
thanksgivings where I got to witness 
“wild Zev” and, of course, walking 
out of the design room to witness 
Allie eating a bug. The only thing I 
regret is not joining sooner — and 
not using enough Drake references 
in this sendoff.

Departure from the familiar is always 
difficult; no one likes change. Change is hard. 
I just never thought it would be quite this 
difficult when I remember that I’m a senior, 
I’m graduating and, most surprisingly heart 
wrenching, I’m leaving the UCSD Guardian. I 
never thought I would get so attached to this 
group of amazing, talented people. And yet, 
here I am. 

When I saw the recruitment flyer back 
during Fall Quarter 2013, I didn’t have grandiose 
plans — not really. I only wanted to pick apart 
sentences and look for grammar mistakes 
because it’s what I’m good at. The Guardian staff 
intimidated me almost as much as walking into 
the packed office, and I thought I would epically 
fail the copy test not too long after. I was even 
more certain that the proctor — the wonderful 
Allie — hated my guts because I took so long 
to complete that test, but just like that, I was 
a copy reader and … deep breaths. Suddenly, 
things didn’t seem quite so intimidating, though 
crossing out Oxford commas hurt a little bit of 
my soul each time I had to do it (it still does, even 
now). I began to look forward to production days, 
to being part of the team and conferring with my 
section editors. Claire had enough faith in me just 
a few months later to encourage me to apply for 
associate copy editor when she was leaving, and I 
still remember how floored I was that she thought 
I could do well there. 

To Allie, Claire and Rachel, I really don’t 
think I could have opened up even a little bit if 
it hadn’t been for the warm welcomes you gave 
me when I first became part of the team. Claire 
and Rachel, thank you most of all for believing 
in me, for pushing me to work harder than I ever 
have. Allie, thank you for all of your smiles, for 

constantly pulling me out of my comfort zone so 
that I could talk to everyone else and put myself 
out there. The birthday cupcakes and letter still 
make me tear up when I think about them. All of 
you are diligent and so well versed in what you 
do; I wanted to aspire to that, from the bottom of 
my heart. If I did you even the tiniest bit of justice 
taking up the position of associate copy editor, 
then I am the happiest person alive. 

To Andrew H.: I have never laughed so much 
or enjoyed being a part of the copy team as I 
have being your associate and flailing over how 
to get everyone into one room at the same time. 
We tried so hard. Sometimes we succeeded, and 
more often we didn’t. Thank you for helping 
me become a more diligent worker with the 
deadlines, with Doodles, with turning out final 
edits in a pinch. You’ve grown into the leadership 
position so well, and I know this is only the 
beginning for you. Farewell, Sir Copy Editor, and 
all the best. 

To Rosina, Waverly, Andrew C., Kriti and 
Micaela: You have been amazing copy readers 
and the most wonderful people that I have had 
the pleasure of getting to know. Thank you for 
all your hard work.

To Zev, Laira, Taylor and everyone else: 
Thank you for the amazing opportunity you 
gave me in letting me a part of this hard-
working, silly group of individuals. The only 
thing I regret is not joining sooner.

I debated writing this. I’m not a fan of 

nostalgia, but I am a huge fan of getting up, leaving 
and never looking back. Unwittingly reminiscing 
about the tumultuous two-plus years I spent 
working for the UCSD Guardian catapulted me 
to the memory of a hashtag my dearest Guardian 
friends and I used to justify our questionable 
Guardian-induced life choices: #fts. For the story. 

I didn’t work as many hours or suffer as much 
as the other editors (my job as the Features Editor 
didn’t demand as much as the other sections or 
managing positions did), but I joined in on the 
co-misery during the few late-night productions in 
which I did participate. Sometime after I crashed 
from the caffeine high that was my entire freshman 
and sophomore year, I grew incredibly jaded 
with it all: the articles, the productions, the entire 
industry of journalism, writing as a career. I left for 
good with plans never to look back. Spoiler alert: 
I did. 

To say that working for the Guardian 
forced me out of my comfort zone would be an 
understatement (and the former editor in me 
cringes at the cliche). I hitchhiked to my first 
interview for a story. My first trip to Las Vegas 
without my parents was a part of an annual 
Guardian tradition. When I started working for 
the paper, my friends would introduce me as “this-
is-Mina-she-works-for-the-Guardian,” resulting 
in me making immediate enemies with anyone 
who was pissed about an editorial on the Israel-
Palestine conflict I had absolutely no hand in. I 
dated my first Textbook Jerk I met while I was 

doing research for a features piece on OkCupid 
(The story never happened. Thanks, you guys). 
It might not sound like much, but I entered my 
freshman year a doe-eyed idealist with big dreams 
and little patience for the details. I’m leaving with a 
louder voice, thicker skin and a solid stance on the 
Oxford comma (For. Definitely for). 

“For the story,” or #fts, came about shortly 
before I left the Guardian. We started saying it to 
refer to the maddeningly stupid situations we kept 
getting ourselves into. It had a ring to it, and I think 
we saw a kernel of truth in what was intended 
to be ironic cynicism: that after this whirlwind 
of disasters, we’d eventually have a montage of 
memories to make us realize that struggle builds 
strength. 

Angela: don’t forget to tell ‘em: “To the left, 
to the left. They must not know ‘bout you” (I 
miss you). Margaret: No, ratchet is not an all-
encompassing adjective but I don’t care. You’re my 
favorite ratchet. Arielle: Thank you for making 
my #pussypoppin dream a reality. You’re welcome 
for the you-know-what (#GPH2013). Neda: 
You believed in me even when I was a dweeby 
freshman intimidated by everything, from your 
scathing yet kind critiques of my crappy restaurant 
reviews, to your fearlessness on the I-5. Claire: 
You are the bright little blessing of a Minion in my 
life and ray of sunshine during my darker days. 
Hayley: My sequoia-legged warrior woman, keep 
spreading your sage wisdom regarding scrubs 
around the world.

So here it is. This is why I did it. For the story.

I didn’t know anything about 
AP style before I applied to 
be a copy reader at the UCSD 
Guardian. I taught myself with 
a variety of Internet sites stating 
basics on numbers, capitalization 
and punctuation before venturing 
over to strange wooden office 
in the Old Student Center. My 
“application” quiz was proctored 
by the managing editor of the time, 
Margaret Yau — who I came to 
know a little better a few months 

later when she fell asleep on my 
shoulder on a 6 a.m. flight to get 
to San Diego in time for Sunday’s 
production — and I most likely 
came off a little too eager. 

As a junior in college, I hadn’t 
gravitated towards a career-
helping organization until I 
joined the Guardian. The copy 
department recently had a hiccup 
in transitioning new editors for 
the fall quarter, so I, alongside 
a team of other incoming copy 

readers just as inexperienced as 
me, took “charge” of the section. I 
learned quickly. Towards the end 
of the quarter, I was still so eager: 
I stayed longer than necessary 
and continued to edit on call after 
leaving the office. By the end of 
the first quarter at the Guardian, I 
was hired as the new associate copy 
editor.   

But as I continued to stay on 
for another year as an editor at the 
Guardian, the job was more than 

the satisfaction of crossing out 
Oxford commas or the constant 
reminders to all my copy readers to 
“FACT CHECK!”; it was about the 
people. 

Allie: You were the first friend I 
made in the office and since then, 
we’ve created such a repertoire 
of memories, pretty much always 
involving editing, writing and 
eating. Lots of eating. A short list 
would be: that one time in Starbucks 
we sipped from red holiday cups 

copy editing for the Guardian, the 
corner table at The Marine Room’s 
high-tide brunch we sat at as we 
watched waves crash on the window 
in front of us, the Pizza Hut pasta 
we ate in your trunk before catching 
the attention of a security guard, 
the taxi you picked me up in from 
the airport and many nights and 
mornings we spent editing and 
rewriting countless papers. 

Margaret: Thank you for 
introducing me to the Guardian and 
to the UCSD Alumni office where 
I had the chance to meet others 
Guardian writers and editors and 
were just as inspiring, such as:

Mina: Minions. Olaf. Obituaries. 
Free food. Also, you’re quite possibly 
one of the most influential writers 
I’ve ever met. 

Laira, Zev, Rebecca, Rachel U., 
Angela, Arielle, Brian and everyone 
else who made me feel welcome 
when I first stepped into the 
Guardian office: You all are lovely. 
Thank you so much for letting me 
be a part of this amazingly diverse 
group. This goes for the second 
batch of staff that transitioned into 
these spots.

Copy: This is to Kim, Becca, 
Kate, Jacqueline and Rachel H. who 
were my first set of copy readers 
and to Andrew, Susan, Rosina, Clara 
and briefly Waverly, my second 
set of copy readers. Thank you for 
helping me grow as an editor and for 
dealing with any mishaps along the 
way. Rachel, I’ll always remember 
you as the underdog who became 
the most diligent worker. Oh, and 
Andrew, I’ll always be there to yell 
at you whenever you feel you need 
the extra discipline! But by the way 
I hear things are going with you and 
Susan, the two of you are carrying 
on just fine. 

This was my starting place. 
To all of you future writers, copy 

readers, designers, photographers, 
advertisers and editors: It might be 
yours too.

12     t h e  u C s D  G u a r D I a n  |  t h u r s D ay,  j u n e  5 ,  2 0 1 4  |  w w w. u C s D G u a r D I a n . o r G  WEEKEND

A community of adrenaline addicts has successfully infil-trated the lawns and beaches 
of San Diego by blending both art 
and sport through slacklining. Walk 
past Sun God Lawn and you’ll see 
them gracefully traversing along a 
two-inch-wide band held up only by 
a ratchet and two arboreal anchors. 
Slacklining was essentially conceived 
as the answer to, “Now what?” once 
mountain climbers reached the 
top of a mountain’s peak, and the 
thirst for thrill could no longer be 
quenched by climbing. To the unini-
tiated, slacklining incites curiosity, 
as well as excitement, for those who 
dare to walk the line.

Two of these adventure enthusi-
asts are Muir College second years 
Christian Cervantes Carr and Matt 
Leung. Carr first slacklined on a fam-
ily trip to Ecuador five months prior 

and eventually forced his roommate 
Leung to take up the sport upon his 
return to California. Slacklining has 
been a major part of both of their 
lives ever since.

“It’s definitely addicting,” Leung 
said, describing the allure of his 
slacklining experience.

They differ in their creative 
approach to slacklining but share a 
common, adventurous motivation. 
“For me, it’s just a way that I can 
adventure and test myself because 
I’m all about trying new things and 
getting better at things,” Carr said.

For Carr and Leung, slacklining 
isn’t a fleeting fad but a sincere pas-
sion to stick with.

“We actually tried to set up a 
club, but we got shut down because 
[UCSD] was a little scared it was a 
liability issue,” Carr said. Thus, an of-
ficial slacklining organization doesn’t 
yet exist at UCSD — at least, not 
with all of the bells and whistles of a 
school-sanctioned club. It exists as 
an underground community of risk-

reapers whose degree of friendliness 
rivals the extent of their passion for 
slacklining itself. You will find no 
pretension or exclusivity anchored 
between the trees of Sun God lawn 
or between the logs at Black’s Beach 
that Leung and Carr hand-fastened 
on their own.  

“If we could find a way to bring 
people together, we would love to 
have a whole group and just slackline 
weekly and just have new people 
come and try it,” Leung said.

Carr welcomes UCSD commu-
nity members to join as well. 

“Come try it! We want more 
people to come, even if it means we 
don’t get to slackline as much,” Carr 
said. “It’s something new; I feel like 
people are scared to try new things 
and to test themselves, so I just want 
to encourage people to have fun and 
do new things.”

The next time you pass by 
Sun God lawn and see a couple of 
slackliners, don’t hesitate to let your 
curiosity take you to new heights. 

“Sun God lawn is a good spot just 
because a lot of people go out there, 
so if other active slackliners see you, 
they can give you tips and have fun 
with you and you can meet people,” 
Leung said.

 For first timers, Leung and Carr 
advise that you use your arms and 
not your shoulders to balance and 
that you don’t look straight down at 
your feet but instead look at least a 
few feet ahead of you. 

“If you look down at your feet too 
much, you concentrate on just the 
next step but not where you’re going,” 
Leung said. This philosophy of always 
looking ahead succinctly encapsulates 
the spirit of slacklining. With eyes kept 
up and forward, novice and veteran 
slackliners alike clearly see what new 
trick and unexplored thrill they wish 
to attempt next. With every step, 
slackliners welcome the endless pos-
sibility of what lies ahead.

To Infinity 
and Beyond, 
My Fellow 
Guardians!

The West Broadway Street in Downtown San Diego is not the art center it 
sounds like it is but rather a city 
administrative center with attorneys 
and district attorneys coming and 
going through the high-rises and 
county courthouse. Situated at the 
intersection of West Broadway Street 
and India Street, Grand Central 
Cafe shines in its enviable corner 
location that opens to two animated 
street views. With the entrance 
above several stair steps, the cafe 
is slightly hidden, but upon entry, 
there is an expansive floor plan: The 
high ceiling, bright and lofty, might 
remind you of train stations like Los 
Angeles Union Station or New York 
Grand Central Terminal. Gleaming 
on the light-brown wooden square 
tables and Windsor chairs, the warm 
sunshine coming through the tall, 
round top windows unfolds the 
scene of the waiting room of the 

station. The bar at the corner has a 
colorful painting of a train above on 
the ceiling; it is commodious and 
relaxing as well as private.

The waiters move quickly in 
their aprons. As soon as a customer 
sits down, one of them comes by 
and asks, “Tea or coffee?” filling the 
cup with the desired beverage. The 
menu is inspired by a subway map in 
which each dish represents a station, 
organized into categories including 
Basics (eggs and a protein), Daybreak 
Omelets, Mexicali Rose (Mexican 
dishes), Breakclub Bagels, Flatcar 
Griddle (toasts and cakes), Side Track 
(sides), Drinks, Fruit and Cereal and 
last but not the least, Caboose (wines 
and beers). The basics include eggs in 
any style and the choices for protein 
among crispy bacon, mild spicy 
sausage and other meat patties. All 
omelets ($8.95) come in large combos 

at an affordable price, with two 
sides to choose from two categories, 
one from homemade country fries 
(hash browns), fresh tomato slices or 
cottage cheese, and the other from 
wheat, rye, white bread, sourdough, 
English muffin or buttermilk biscuit. 
The wheat bread tends to be overly 
greasy because of the butter; luckily 
the mild homemade-style omelet 
balances out the grease. The Garden 
Patch Omelet has broccoli chunks 
that are cooked to a refreshing 
texture — well-done but not too soft 
to compromise its freshness. The 
Multigrain Pancake (three pancakes 
for $5.95) is one of the most popular 
dishes and is usually spotted on 
several tables in the cafe. The inside-
out caramel color of multigrain 
distinguishes it from other plain 
pancakes, and the mellow taste and 
warm, velvety texture becomes rich 

and silky after being dipped in butter 
and syrup. 

For people working in this district, 
the Grand Central Cafe is considered 
a convenient and quiet breakfast diner 
to kick-start the work day. The open 
interior also saves them waiting time. 
If you are a future law school student

Front Street & B Street From there, it 
is a ten-minute walk. The big round 
clock and the TV on the walls of the

I woke up groggy and checked the time. It was 2:40 p.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 9, 2012. I threw on 
my lived-in slims and my too-tight 
Belle & Sebastian t-shirt, which 
had a picture of a girl and boy 
chemist working in a lab together 
with a drawing of dopamine above 
them. Maybe I would have a happy 
relationship with the newspaper, but 
at the time, I was already 10 minutes 
late to my interview.

By an act of God, or by my 
lovely editor (and eventual editor-
in-chief) Laira Martin, I was hired 
as a Lifestyle contributing writer 
my freshman fall quarter. I ate and 
drank, wrote and edited, published 
and printed, all the while moving 
up to staff writer my winter quarter. 
At the end of that quarter, I was 
promoted to become a co-editor for 
the Lifestyle Section with the ever-
talented Jean Lee. My freshman year 
came to a close, and I would steer 
the section alone for my second 
year. It’s a daunting task, truly, and I 
admire and respect every editor that 
has been, or is currently, with the 
UCSD Guardian.

What makes the Guardian 
such an amazing experience to go 
through is that we aren’t a family. 
We aren’t, really. I look nothing like 
Lauren Koa or Zev Hurwitz (okay, 
maybe a little like Zev). Taylor 
Sanderson could be my mom, but 
she isn’t. (Actually EmKu should 
be our mom, if anything.) Kelvin 
Noronha isn’t my brother or my 
nephew or my uncle. And Teddi 
Faller isn’t my little sister.

We’re students, and we chose 
to be part of the Guardian. You are 
born into a family, but with the 
Guardian, we are born out of our 
own ambitions and passions. We 
crave to make a name for ourselves, 
to put in hard work and long days to 
be something greater. We collaborate 
as a team of inspired individuals 
who work to, well, tell it how it is, 
straight-up. We edit and rewrite, pore 
over texts and pages on InDesign, 
and as we change our product, we 
ourselves are changing.

I couldn’t say any less of myself. 
Without the Guardian, I don’t think 
the same doors of opportunity 
would have opened up to me 
anywhere else. And this doesn’t 
go without a few shout-outs to the 
people who helped me get to where 
I am today.

To Lair Bear, my big and the 
one whose footsteps I strived to 
follow. To Allie Kiekhofer and 
Rachel Huang, you two were the 
firm voices in edits and the anchor 
to my section (and hilarious — that, 
too). To Dorothy Van and Zoe 
McCracken, design is tough — I’ve 
tried. But my section would be a 
blank page without your creativity 
and perfectionism. And to Teddi 
Faller, my successor, my little, if 
you will. You were the first writer I 
hired in the fall (ever, actually), the 
first writer I hired as an Editorial 
Assistant and you were the first 
writer who I knew, from Day One, 
would eventually take the reins to 
my beloved Lifestyle Section. It’s all 
yours now; I know you’ll take care 
of it.

And here I am now, out of space 
and out of time. The memories have 
been good, the nights have been long 
and the people I’ve met through the 
Guardian will always hold a special 
place in my newspaper-inked heart. I 
could never really say goodbye to the 
Guardian, so I’ll keep it casual: It’s 
been dope.

Women’s Soccer
Previous Record: 7-6-5 // Projected Record: 6-7-5
Previous Finish Fifth in CCAA, Missed Postseason Berth
Projected Finish: Sixth in CCAA, Miss Postseason Berth

Women’s soccer missed the postseason for the first time since 2000, 
establishing a substandard performance in the conference and amassing little 
momentum for next year. Additionally, women’s soccer will have little experi-
ence in the coming season, as 11 of the returning players are entering only 
their sophomore year. While the rising class of young Tritons may be perceived 
as an advantage over last year, the departure of key seniors and the relative 
inexperience of the remaining team may lead to another difficult year in con-
tentious CCAA play. Next season will most likely serve as a developmental 
period for the youthful squad. 

Track & Field
Previous Finish Five Triton Qualifiers for NCAAs, two All-American Finishes
Projected Finish: Seven Triton Qualifiers for NCAAs, three All-American Finishes

The track and field squad certainly looks toward 2015 with promise. The Tritons have the full intention and poten-
tial to improve on this season’s solid nationals showing, as all five Triton qualifiers will be returning for action next 
season. Junior thrower Nash Howe’s abilities continue to grow while others, such as redshirt freshman decathlete Dan 
Golubovic, who had much more in him than his decathlon national results showed, have more years to develop their 
skills. Furthermore, a handful of other Tritons on the brink of qualifying marks in 2014 ensures next season’s UCSD 
representatives at the NCAAs will be slightly, if not significantly, larger. 

Men’s Volleyball

Previous Finish: Three-way tie for last place in Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation
Projected Finish: Last place in Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation

To say last season’s outcome for the Tritons was disappointing is a major 
understatement. UCSD totaled only four wins out of 27 total contests, and two 
of those victories were against the other two teams that tied with the Tritons 
for last place in the MPSF. However, the underwhelming record deviated little 
from a pattern of losing seasons in recent years, and with the Tritons losing 
their top two players, seniors outside hitter Nick Iorfino and opposite hitter 
Johl Awerkamp, the team does not appear ready to clear up its loss column. 
This past season was unpredictably bad, but things may not get much better, 
if at all, in the coming year. 

Women’s Volleyball

Previous Finish: Elimination in NCAA West Regional 
Semifinal
Projected Finish: Elimination in NCAA West Regional Final 
Round

With only two seniors leaving for the upcoming season, the core group 
of women’s volleyball will return this fall season with promise. Sophomore 
All-American and outside hitter Danielle Dahle, who averaged a team high 
3.25 kills per set and led UCSD in kills, points, points per set, attack attempts 
and receptions the past season, will continue to improve and dominate. With 
Olympic gold medalist and two-time NCAA Player of the Year Ricci Luyties 
at the coaching helm, the Tritons look to build upon their superb season and 
come out as a top team in the competitive CCAA while contending for the 
national championship.

Previous Record: 26-6 // Projected Record: 25-7

HILARY  LEE

OPINION    EDITOR

It takes a certain type of masochist to 
sign your life away to editing for a student-
run publication. At some point, even the 
most enthusiastic, bright-eyed staffer will 
become jaded and frayed at the edges (cue 
the bitter laughter). No editor is immune to 
this phenomenon — for a perfectionist like 
myself, the job was especially debilitating. 
Despite the grimness of these realities, I 
wouldn’t have altered my experience with the 
UCSD Guardian in any manner.

The work was at once invigorating 
and all- encompassing, gratifying and 
maddening and beautiful and terrible. I’d 
answer texts from writers at parties and 
fret about finding editorial sources in the 
midst of leafing through midterms. I’d 
royally piss off the design editor (sorry, 
Leo) for monopolizing the only half-
decent computer in the office to check 
and recheck copy edits. Under my rigid 
regimen, writers would turn in early from 
wild nights out in Vegas to drunkenly 
address my nitpicky edits.

Returning to the squalor of the 
office every Wednesday and Sunday 
furthermore posed an obstacle to the 
obsessive-compulsive germaphobe in 
me. During productions, I would watch 
in undisguised distaste as my colleagues 
milled around spilling oily food on every 
piece of furniture imaginable. There 
came a point in time when I would type 
using two pens because I couldn’t bear to 
make skin contact with the thick brown 
crust that universally blanketed the office 
keyboards (this practice, unsurprisingly, 
was infuriatingly inefficient). My further 
experimentation with draping the 
keyboards with paper towels and blindly 

typing was also largely ineffectual and 
sadly comical.

Although I was forced to live with 
a musky and unidentifiable odor that 
never seemed to escape our doors, I kept 
coming back week after week. I never 
missed a production during my term, 
not even the ones following the sleepless, 
reckless nights I spent out with my fellow 
Opinioner, Rev. I learned more from my 
editorship than I did from any class I have 
taken. I gained the opportunity to work 
with some of the most brilliant, talented, 
committed and passionate people I have 
ever encountered. If I wrote about them 
all, I’d liberally exceed word count and 
deserve the inevitable passive-aggressive 
text from an editor, much like the kind I 
used to send out myself. 

Of course, my sendoff wouldn’t be 
complete without a word to my wunderkind 
successors. Lauren: You have risen above and 
beyond what I ever accomplished during 
my time here. I knew from the moment 
you called me at midnight on a Friday to 
ask for help on your first main story that I’d 
have no qualms entrusting Opinion to you 
further down the line. Also, Hong Kong milk 
tea FTW. Kelvin: We all knew you ditched 
production for the zoo that one day last 
year. It’s okay. I’d have opted to see the baby 
pandas over trimming down incoherent and 
rambling letters to the editor any day. Smart 
kid; keep on keepin’ on.

Finally, Rebekah a.k.a. Birdland: We both 
set out together to join the Guardian back in 
the first quarter of our freshman year. I feel 
privileged to say that four years and many 
sacrificed weekends later, we are leaving this 
ship together. 

JENNY  PARK
Asking an illustrator to write about her experience at the newspaper has to be some form of cruel and unusual 

punishment. There’s a reason why I draw for the paper instead of navigating the seas of AP Stylebooks and 
frustrated copy readers. The last article I remember writing for a school paper was back in high school: a sad 
excuse of a movie review on The Princess and the Frog. I’ve come a long way in these past four years; namely, 
now I draw sad excuses of illustrations about upcoming Disney flicks instead. (However, my secret Lois Lane 
daydreams remain ever the same.)

Looking back on my time at our beloved UCSD school newspaper, a bevy of questions arises. Is there more I 
could have done while I was here? How will my successors fare after I’ve graduated? What am I ultimately taking 
away from this experience? And do I have any regrets?

The answers in order are: 
1) Maybe, but let’s not dwell on that for too long.
2) I have absolute faith in Elyse and Annie. They’re competent artists on their own but with Jeff staying around 

to help them out, I have no doubt that they’ll do a bang-up job as Art Editor and Associate Art Editor. 
3) Mostly Rebekah. She is graduating with me and I will steal her artistic talents for myself. Apologies to avid 

“Birdland” readers.
4) My only regret is never meeting Ventus the Corgi. 
But the bigger question remains: What will my legacy at the Guardian be? My illustration for the Obama 

inauguration story? My tiny depictions of baby Sun Gods? My occasional (but hilarious) biographical comics?
I decided to ask the internet — the greatest source of information known to mankind. The answer was almost 

unanimous: My time at this fine reporting establishment will forever be immortalized in FedoraMan91, a grim 
reminder of what pink-maned children’s cartoon characters await us in the hellfires of online dating.

So let it be written, this is how I choose to be remembered, with a joke about bronies. Jenny “Bronies are 
Awful” Park. Truly, I leave large shoes for my successors to fill.

ART    EDITOR

REBEKAH    DYER

cartooNist

Literally the first thing I did as a UCSD freshman was find the UCSD Guardian office and demand that I 
do a comic, topped off with a hastily compiled collection of doodles I called a “portfolio.” The weirdest thing 
was they actually let me do one! I had it all figured out: It was about a private eye in L.A. in the 1940s who also 
happened to be a pigeon. Classic film noir set up. Also most likely a product of a “random humor” phase, which 
I am eternally thankful to have grown out of.

On the flip side, I’m thankful I didn’t grow out of writing and drawing Birdland for the Guardian. Not only 
because it forced me to draw regularly and get better (though that’s pretty cool) but because the 100+ strips I’ve 
done over the years are a direct way for me to look back at my college experience. Inconsequential bird comics 
about femme fatales are tied to memories just by virtue of them both being created at the same time. And that’s 
nice for someone like me whose memory is at goldfish levels. 

I’ve gotta say, it feels weird to write more than 150 words when I’m usually only working with four 2”x2” 
panels. But there are a few more things to mention. First, I’m so proud of my fellow illustrators and feel really 
lucky to have had some amazing art editors (I’m looking at you Jenny and Jeff) who remind me weekly why I 
sacrifice four hours of my Saturdays to draw some birds wearing hats. Really looking forward to putting off my 
biochem Ph.D. work next year to stalk the Guardian’s website and keep up with the incredible art. Second, a big 
shout-out to my apartment mate and connection to the writing part of the Guardian, Hilary, who helped delude 
me into thinking my comics were quality material. Third, if you’ve ever read and liked Birdland you are cool and 
also my friend now. Sorry that’s how it works.

Honestly though, the positive feedback I’ve gotten from here has been unrivaled in my four years at UCSD. 
College is never smooth sailing, but the Guardian really helped calm those choppy waters, and I am eternally 
grateful.

After a rollercoaster ride of a 2013–14 season, the 
Guardian is already eager for the 2014–15 campaign 
for Triton athletics. Take a look at our guide to the 

coming year for blue and gold. 

Previous Record: 38–16 // Projected Record: 42–12

2014-15

Previous Finish Eliminated in final round of NCAA Regionals
Projected Finish: Late-round elimination at NCAA Nationals

Baseball

After experiencing substantial success this season, the returning squad 
is poised to compete at the national level. Rising juniors and seniors are 

now veterans with postseason experience, and most of the talent on the 
Triton roster will return while continuing to develop. Breakout stars 

like Erik Lewis, Troy Cruz and Brandon Shirley can certainly repeat 
their performances while assuming positions of leadership on the 
team in place of several, valuable, graduating seniors. The bullpen, 

while more than proficient, must continue to improve, and the 
team must maintain consistency at the plate down the order. 

Under head coach Eric Newman’s guidance, the Tritons will 
advance deep in the postseason in 2015.

Softball

Previous Finish Game Three Elimination at NCAA Regionals
Projected Finish: Game Two Elimination at NCAA Regionals

In spite of the loss of four starting seniors, including All-American catcher Caitlin Brown, 
the Tritons will have a strong class of juniors taking the torch. However, the new leaders will 
undoubtedly have to improve their game in the coming season. Players such as sophomore out-
fielder Callie Grant (.433 batting average in 2013), who recorded only four non-single hits all 
season, will have to come up with bigger at-bats. Pitchers, freshman Alayna Brenman and soph-
omore, Hannah Duarte, must step up and help sophomore southpaw ace Alexis Edwards fill the 
gap left by senior right-hander Jennifer Manuel. UCSD risks taking steps back, but if things go 
right, they can also exceed last year’s finish. 

Men’s Basketball
Previous Record: 15–11 // Projected Record: 14–10
Previous Finish Missed CCAA Postseason Berth in Final Game
Projected Finish: First-Round Elimination at CCAA League Championship

Losing senior point guard James McCann will undoubtedly change the offensive dynam-
ics of the team. However, now up-and-coming freshman Adam Klie and head coach Eric Olen 
both have a year of experience under their belts, and the Tritons will have a go-to rising star and 
familiarity between the coaching staff and the players. A question mark still lingers over the new 
recruits, as the lack of a true point guard may force incoming freshman George Buaku to take 
over McCann’s previous role. UCSD has the potential to become the top team in the CCAA, but 
next season will only be a stepping stone to get to that point.

Men’s Soccer
Previous Record: 14-3-5 // Projected Record: 12-6-4
Previous Finish Third-Round Elimination at NCAA Tournament
Projected Finish: First-Round Elimination in NCAA Tournament

After a fairly successful season, men’s soccer will have huge voids to fill with nine seniors 
graduating, most notably the All-American trio consisting of defender Alec Arsht, mid-
fielder Andisheh Bagheri and goalkeeper Josh Cohen. The Tritons, however, still have a ros-
ter talented enough with players who can step up in order to stay competitive in the CCAA. 
Soon-to-be senior forward, Santa Monica College transfer Alessandro Canale is currently 
the definitive leader of the upcoming season. Alongside freshman standout forward Malek 
Bashti, Canale and his experience with Team USA in the 2013 FIFA Beach Soccer World 
Cup will be keys to success for the young team. 

Women’s Water Polo
Previous Record: 27–13 // Projected Record: 23–17
Previous Finish Eighth-Place Elimination at NCAAs
Projected Finish: Elimination in NCAA play-in-game

With the loss of four seniors, including all-time UCSD scoring leader utility Sarah 
Lizotte, co-captain and all-around playmaker center Melissa Bartow and top defender utility 
Leah Gonzales, the next season will look to be a year of rebuilding 
for the Tritons. However, while UCSD will be without its top gun 
in Lizotte, the team still has the potential to continue the pro-
gram’s winning ways. They have a good goaltender in sopho-
more Courtney Miller and strong stars like sophomore two-
meter defender Alexis Wieseler and junior attacker Jolene 
Guiliana, who are fully capable of taking over. The Tritons 
will struggle more next year but will nonetheless remain a 
national contender. 

Women’s Basketball
Previous Record: 16–11 // Projected Record: 18–9
Previous Finish First-Round Elimination at CCAA League 
Championship
Projected Finish: Championship Round Elimination at 
CCAAs

Last season’s results were far from indicative of the Tritons’ potential. They 
lost their top player, junior guard Miranda Seto, for four games due to injury, and 
UCSD concluded the season after squandering a 21-point lead to Cal State Los 
Angeles with a 60–59 loss in the first round of postseason action. Led by new 
seniors McKennan Bertsch, Miranda Seto and Dana Webster and developing 
stars such as freshman forward Cassie MacLeod, the Tritons will look to avoid 
any accidental losses. The team will suffer without graduating seniors Megan 
Perry and Erin Dautremont but have serious potential to make it far next year.

Projected Finish: Elimination in first round of NCAA Championship

Under the leadership of 2013 Western Water Polo Association Coach of the Year Denny 
Harper and a strong cast of rising seniors, the men’s water polo team has every reason to 
believe that the 2014 campaign will be even more successful than last year’s CCAA title. 
Cameron Ravanbach is one of the best goaltenders in the country, and at the height of its 
game, the Triton offense outscored even the best opponents. To edge out the competition 
next year, the squad will have to overcome the hot-and-cold streaks that were characteristic 
of the 2013 season and get the offense going earlier in key matchups. 

Previous Record: 34–18 // Projected Record: 30–22
