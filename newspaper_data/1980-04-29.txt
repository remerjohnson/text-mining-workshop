BY SVEN SERRANO 
Outer Mongolia remains a land shrouded in mystery to most 

westerner . The very name conjures up images of Ghengis 
Khan and his hordes sweeping acro s Asia on horseback. 

Conquest, however, is being replaced by modern diplomacy. 
The Mongolian People's Republic today is a country on the 

'As long as you feed your horse you 
will never lack transportation.' 
path of modernization, actively seeking to open low key trade 
and cultural contacts with the West. 

One student from UCSD, Barbara·Ann Thompson, 
recently visited Mongolia and brought back a descriptive 
account of life there; ., 

"The Mongolian tourist office, Zuulchia, told me that I was 
the first western student of working·c1ass background ever to 
visit their country," Thompson recalled. 

In the past, or .. ) big game hunters and more recently groups 
of wealthy tourists from France, Germany, Japan and the US 
have reached Mongolia. 

Thompson arranged her solitary trip first in Finland, where 
as a student she joined the Finnish.Mongolian friendship 
society. She received her pre.arranged visa in Moscow, then 
poceeded via Soviet Central Asia to the Siberian city of 
Irkutsk, the transfer point for r.a and air connections to the 
Mongolian capital city of Ulan Bater. 

Thompson's interest in the economic, cultural and social 
problems of the pastoral. nomadic peoples of Central Asia 
brought her to Mongolia, where there are over 30 
domesticated animals for everyone person. "On the 43 hour 
train trip in I saw herda of sheep and horses grazing on open 
collective pasture landa," she said. 

Ulan Bater, known as Urga before the 1921 revolution of 
Sukhe Bater which established Mongolia as the world'I second · 
socialist state, is today a city of 350,000 people who live both 
in traditional ghers or yurts (a round felt tent) and modern 
Soviet and Chinese buildt apartments. 

While modern bUies and trucks are the primary mode of 
transportation in the city, traditional nomads still ride their 
ponies on city-streets. "Cars may run out of fuel," Mongols say, 
"or get stuck in the snow, but as long as you feed your horse 
you will nev~ lack transportion." . 

Thompson s guide, Tsolmon, was a young marned 
Mongolian woman with one child who ,",ow studies English in 
the Soviet city of Odessa. Mongolian tradition allows children 
to be left with grandparents so that young people can live their 
lives and work outside the home. 

Tsolmon accompanied Thompson on walks around the 
capital to visit the Buddhist lamasery wit~ its ornate temples 
and saffron. gowned monks, the State HIstory Museum and 
the palace of the last king. 

"As we walked Tsolmon and I talked about childcare, 
womens' lives and politics, history and academics. We really 
got to be best friends". 

Continuing her account, Ann described her special status in 
Mongolia. "Zuulchin realized I was different, 10 they allowed 
me to be apart from the other tourists - at meals, on 
excursions, and they extended to me liberties not normally 
allowed". T solmon and Ann went on unsupervised excursions 
to observe wildlife and to collect samples of plants and flowers. 

"The Mongolians like me a lot and after five days they sent 
me on a special all·expense paid trip to the Gobi Desert, as an 
honorary 'friend of the Mongolian People. ' However, after 
days of eating yak and camel meat, along with yak milk, and 
yak ice cream in the hotel, the overrich fat and meat diet finally

AS Candidates Surprised 
by'Mix-up' in Runoff Date 

The AS election everyone thought would be 
tomorrow will be held next Tuesday, May 6, 
Elections Commissioner Bruce Napell said 
yesterday. 

"We knew it was May 6 for a long time. We 
just forgot to tell everybody," Napell said, fixing 
the blame on a series of Daily Guardian ads 
written by elections officials which gave the 
April 30 date. 

"It just got mixed up somehow," he said. 
The candidates were informed over the 

weekend, some just in time to stop production on 
hurridly produced campaign propaganda. 

Linda Sabo and most of the Student Interests 
Not Special Interests slate found out Friday as 
Napell told everyone he could find that the date 
was changed. 

Most of the rest of the candidates found out 
Sunday when Napell and the elections 
commission started phoning candidates telling 
them of the mistake. 

Almost all the candidates never questioned 
the April 30 date. 

"They told us when we went over the election 
codes that there were some changes. I just 
assumed that was one of those changes," Very 
Silly candidate Jeremy Charlton said. 

"I worked all weekend to get out campaign 
literature," Charlton said, adding that he could 
now proceed at a slightJy more leisurely pace. 

Elections by·laws specify that the ntn·off must 
take place Tuesday of the sixth week. 

All of the candidates managed to avoid the 
pitfall of printing literature that identified the run· 
off date as April 30. 

"Just tell them to vote. It's safer, said Bob 
Spielmann, a Student Welfare run·off 
contender. 

Office Doors Will Unlock 
To Students at Lunch Hour 

BY JEFFREY S. LEE 
Staff Writer 

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Richard 
Armitage was unaware that some student 
services closed during the lunch hour each day. 

"I had no idea that this was happening," said 
Armitage, who is now making an effort to 
change this. . 

After The Daily Guardian brought the matter 
to Armitage's attention last week, he discussed it 
at a meeting of the deans and student affairs 
directors. 

As this story evolved, changes began to take 
place in the procedures of some of the student 
service offices around campus. 

Prior to these scheduling changes, Revelle 
and Warren college's provost offices closed 
from 12 noon to 1 pm. The Student Financial 
Aid Service's and the Third College's academic 
advising offices were also closed during that 
time. 

Both the Muir College's provost office and the

Third College's provost office remained open, 
but only to answer phones, make appointments 
and ~ve referrals. 

(The Third College Provost's office il the only 
one on campus separated from academic 
counseling. ) 

Revelle Provost Chia Wei Woo explained 
that the doors at the provosts office were locked 
from noon to 1 pm to give the receptionists a 
chance to "catch up" on their paper work and to 
take a lunch break. 

However , Woo said the phones were still 
answered at that time, if a student came to the 
door and knocked, they would be let in. 

Woo allO said that staggering hours would 
diminish services to students, since the services 
offered require more than "half staff."

Assaults

In US Classrooms 

Most Nations Have Outlawed Corporal Punishment, But 
Bruising, Bloodying Still Go On In All But 3 States 

BY NAT HENTOFF

A Coming, New York, teacher recently punched a child 10 hard in the eye that

to find out that the boy wu constipated. 

Not all corporal puni.hment is uaed to 
"puni.h" school children. Often, a paddle or 
lOme other blunt instrument i. admini.tered to 
backlides and other partI of the body in order to 
"motivate" .tudents. In Beggs, Oklahoma, for 
in.tance, children with learnin, di.abilitiea are 
now being "mainstrearned' into regular 
cluaea. In order to keep them up to the mark, 
those who fall behind in their atudiea or keep 
miupelling worda are whacked by a paddle on 
their thigh., arm., elbows, and backsidea. 

Official child-beating is practiced in all but 
three .tates - New Jer.ey, Ma •• achUNtla, 
and Maine. Hawaii has declared a moratorium 
on corporal puniahment while evaluating 
chargea that it hu been abused. 
. In nearly all other nations, however, the 
beating of school chil~en has long since been 
abolished. Poland did away with it in 1783, and 
during the next century France, the 
Netherlands and Finland followed. 

By now, corporal punishment is also illegal in 
Japan, Jordan, Israel, Italy, Sweden, Denmark 
and the entire communist bloc. Indeed, the only 
maior nations that continue to allow child abuse 

. in the school. are West Germany, England and 
the United State • . 

In England, attempts to end corporal 
punishment have been beaten back from 1669 
(a "Children's Petition" to Parliament) to the 
preaent. On January 16 of this year, in a 
plebiscite conducted by the National Union of 
'reachen, 90 per cent of 258,000 Britiah 
pedagogues polled vehemently supported the 
continued use of child· beating al an eallential 
weapon in maintaining order in the c1usroom. 

So too, in America, where a considerable 
majority of teachers vociferou.ly insist on the 
need to UN force u an educational tool. When 
Los Angelel aboli.hed corporal punishment 
four years ago, the teachen' union there 
pledged to get it reinstated: this put February 
2, they succeeded. 

I n the appalled minority of abolitioni.t teacher. is Edith Oldham, who recently 
retired after 30 yean in the Louisville, 

Kentucky, l'!Jblic achooola. Writing in the 
Loui.ville TIme., she declared, "I have 

witneued many territying acts. I have leen 
children lifted and pulled and dragged by their 
hair, youngsters slammed violently against a 
wall so hard that they feD down on the floor, 

chil~en .truck by pointers or yardstick. that 
broke from the impact . .. (Yet) studentl who 
are mo.t often targetl for corporal puni.hment 
are those with v.y low self-esteem. 

"Being paddled (and otherwise abused) only 
makea them feel more helpless, lelf.rejecting, 
and angry. It is, plain and simple, child abuse." 

Casea in the file. of American Civil Liberties 
Union affiliates and various youth advocacy 
groups around the country underline Edith 
Oldham's point that corporal puniahment often 
doea become chad abuse. 

After all, al BrandN Univer.ity social policy 
professor Dr. David Gil emphasizes; "Rarely, if 
ever, is corporal punillhment administered for 
the benefit of the attacked child .. . Usually it 
serves the immediate needs of the attacking 
adult who is seeking relief from his 
uncontrollable anger and stres • . " 

For example, in a small New York town, a 
fifth grade boy, afflicted with arthritis, is kicked 
to the noor by a gym teacher for refu.ing to do 
his exerciaea. Becau.e his kn~ lock, the boy 
can't do thOle exercilea, but the teacher in.i.ts 
that he could if he tried. 

Or, in North Little Rock, Arkansas, a 
principal so Io&t control of himself during a bout 
of child-beating that an eighth grade boy wu 
put into the hospital for ·two days . The student's 
crime; he had been talking ·in clu. without 
permiuion. Said the boy's mother: "My child 
has been abused, and Lord know. how many 
more. But this i. not the way to make a child 
learn anything. What a child need. is 
confidence in jlrow~ups, not to fear them." 

P rofeasor David Friedman of the Univer.ity of Southern California School of Medicine, and Alma Friedman, a Lo. 
Angeles School. pupa service. counselor, 
recently conducted a survey of the 
physiological harm that fearsome teachers and 
principals actually can inflict on children. They 
included: "severe tissue damage, lower spine 
injuries, sciatic nerve damage, and even blood 
clots due to paddling. Recent evidence lead. to 
the suspicion of poI.ible whiplash injury 
eapecially in younger children." 

Corporal punishment, they add, "inhibits 
learning and interferes with the 
accomplishment of the important 
developmental tasks of children .. . It should be 
considered as chad abu.e and prohibited in all 
schools." 

One route hu been closed to tholle parents 
and child· care professionals who are trying to 
prohibit official child-beating. In 1977, the 
Supreme Court considered a corporal 
punishment case, Ingraham Il. Wrighr, in which 
two junior high school victim. had been paddled 
so severely that one had to stay in bed, face 
down, for a week and the other 10lt full use of his 
arm for roughly the lame period of time. 

Nonetheleas, in a 5-4 vote, the High Court 
decided that corporal puni.hment in the 
school., no matter how severe, did not violate

Stroke of Genius: 
Play the Show 
Without the Lead! 

BY JEFF BERESFORD·HOWE 
What would happen if you took the lead character in a play 

and simply left him out of a performance? 
Speculation could be endless, but one thing is certain: 

marquees would be different. We would have One Gentleman 
01 Verona, The Chicago Six, Bob and Carol and Ted and 
Three Horsemen of the Apocalypse. 

Perhaps a Cecil B. Demille film with a cast of 999 would be 
playing next door . 

Jeff Beres/ord.Howe is news editor lor The Daily 
Gu£'rdian . 

Fortunately, we don'thave to speculate on the outcome of 
such an interesting experiment. We are lucky enough to have 
had just the idea tested at the Cassius Carter Center Stage. 

The play i. the Bilw Inquest. It is a dramatized version of 
the transcript into the death of Black South African leader 
Stephen Biko. He was "bann~," an insidious punishment 
that amounts to house arrest. It also carries with it the 
restriction that the "banned" man may talk to only one person 
at a time. 

Biko ignored the order and continued the campaign against 
the South African government. He was arrested and died in 
1977 from blows received during a police beating. 
. The.play .e/ects excerpts from the inquest, pointing to the 
Inconslltency and brutality of the treatment Biko received. 
Trial acenes are alternated with Biko on stage alone talking 
about hi. life and beliefi. 

But the actor playing Stephen Biko was sick last Tuesday 
night, so they preased on without him. 

A few times, the actors Itarted to rearrange the set to 
prepare for Biko'. entrance, and then remembered that the 
.tar wu gone and reatored thing. to order. 

There was some trouble with continuity. Several emotional 
high. were obviously missing. But a man selling tickets to 
future show. (The director? In any case, I didn't have enough 
money to buy any) 811Ured me that the Biko Inquest opened 
on Broadway without any Biko character. . 

Curious, I got a schedule and looked for what's ahead at 
the Globe, and I have some reservations about their new 
policy. 

For example, the Globe wililtage the one-man The Gospel 
According to Mark without an actor . Instead, a Bible will be 
placed on a stool on stage. The print will be enlarged, Globe 
officials lay, and opera glasses will be provided for the infirm. 
An usher will tum the pages every five minutes .

Editor; 

I voted in opposition to an increa.e in tuition ratea of $6.50 
per quarter because I do not advocate the installation of a 
jacuzzi heated to well over 100 delP'eeI and night lighting 
which can not be accomplished through solar heating. 

Aren't college students anti· nuclear power? Then why do 
you want to use more energy? 

Also, what about land space? Must we cut down more 
tr~? More locker room. and ahowera are not necessary. I 
use the preaent facilities daily and have never observed all the 
available .howers and lockers in use at the same time. 

The tuition of many students is aublidized by their parents. 
Are these the students who vote for a tuition increa.e? 
Working students think the tuition is high enough.

Vance Resigns; Carter 
Kept Him in the Dark 

WASHINGTON - Secre-
"tary of Slate Cyrus R. Vance, 
apparently kept in the dark 
about a decisive White House 

~ting, resigned yesterday in 
a public clash with Pre.ident 
Carter about the aborted 
hostage rescue miuion in Iran. 

An administration official 
who requested anonymity told 
The Associated Press that 
Vance had no idea Carter 
intended to consult with other 
key advisers about the rescue 
operation at a National 
security Council meeting on 
Friday, April 11. 

Vance was on a brief 
Florida vacation. He returned 
after the weekend and 
regi5tered his diaaent at a 
second council seslion April 
15. By then, according to this 
account, Carter had virtually 
decided to approve the 
operation. 

Vance quietly .ubmitted his 
reaignation to Carter last 
Monday, before the rescue 
attempt failed in an Iranian 
desert Thursday night beeaUN 
of equipment failurea and 
other mishaps. 

Sourcea said Vance wu so 
upset by the deci.ion that he 
would have left even had it 
Mlcceeded. 

The administration official 
said the Defense Department 
planned the operation with 
almost no margin for error . To 
succeed, he said, everything 
had to go right. 

The White House released 
an exchange of hand-written 
letters between Carter and 
Vanee that barely touched on 
the disagreement. Still, it was 

an extraordinary disclosure of 
differences between a 
preaident and one of his 
principal advisers. 

Vance's departure prompt· 
ed spe<;ulation about other 
re.ignatins within the 
administration . Defense 
Secretary Harold Brown, who 
supported the re. c ue 
operation, denied he planned 
to resign. So did State 
Department spokesman 
Hodding Carter, assistant 
secrelarr of state for public 
affairs; Palt Derian, assistant 
secretary for human rights, 
and Richard Holbrooke, 
assistant secretary for Far 
Eastern affairs . 

Carter, visiting wounded 
rescue million liurvivors at an 
Air Force hospital in Texas, 
was asked by reporters 
whether Vance's reaignation 
would harm negotiations in 
Iran. "His departure did not 
have any adverle effect on the 
rescue of American ho.tagea, 
nor wiD it in the future," the 
president replied . He called 
Vance "a fine and dedicated 
man" who had served the 
nation well.

S~xual Harassment Topic 
Of Week Long Project at 
UCSD Beginning May 2 

The sexual harassment of 
female worker. and students 
by men in politions of 
authority is the subject of 
"Going Public/Making 
Changes," an art project 
crealed by Mary . Linn 
Hughes, an MFA candidate in 
Viaual Arts here. 

1he project includes a 
Central Library display , a 
mal. mailing, a conference 
and a workshop. 

"I didn't do the project as a 
sociological or psycholo!ical 
study," Hughes said. My 
goal i.lo get information oul to 
the public using the tools I 
have as an artist." 

A. part of lhe project, 
Hughes has put together a 
display which wiD be on exhibit 
in Central from May 2·14. 
The display , " Violence 
Against WOl11t!n: A Social 
Phenomenon, " feature» 
books, informational handouts 
and art by Hughes on sexual 
violence. 

Hughes also has helped 
organize a statewide 
conference on the issue of 
sexual harassment on May 3 
at the university. A workshop 
for women to discuss the 
problem and share their 

experiences is scheduled at 
noon on May 6 in the North 
Conference Room of the 
university 's Student Center. 

The final component of the 
project is a five .part booklet 
designed by Hughes which will 
be mailed to 3,000 students , 
staff and faculty member. and 
University of California 
administrators. The booklet 
titled Worst of All is the Fact 
that No One Talks About It , 
was compiled after Hughes 
sent out questionnaires and 
received 60 responses from 
women relating their own 
experiences with sexual 
haraument. 

"It's clear to me that sexual 
harassment is a problem," 
Hughes said. "The overwhel· 
ming senile I got from the 
responses was 'even if I said 
anything, nothing would be 
done. ' The g rievan ce 
procedure is not well · 
publicized and women are left 
feeling powerless." 

Revising the grievance 
procedure and creating a 
statewide committee to study 
the problem are some of the 
issues Hughes hopes to 
discuss a t the May 3 
conference.

More Amtrak Runs Doubtful 
Despite Rider Increase Trend 

LOS ANGEl ES (AP) - Ridership on 
Amtrak'. six daily runs between Los Angeles 
and San Diego is up 31 percent overlast year , 
and a study by Amtrak engineers says even 
more passenger trains could be added to 
existing tracks , despite contrary claims by the 
Santa Fe Railway. 

The three·month study also concludes that 
a Santa Fe proposal to add a third main track 
between Los Angeles and Fullerton is an 
unreasonable way to ease congestion . 

In.tead, the engineers say a series of 
crossover track5 could accomplish t.he same 
thing on the existing dual· track roadway at a 
cost of leas than $1 million. 

But Sante Fe officials said that although 
ther .had not ~et seen the study , the company 
poSItion remamed the &arne as in December 
when it rejected a California Department of 

Transporta tion request for a seventh San 
Diego·Los Angeles passenger train. 

"We have declined the request on the basis 
of interference of exi5ting service," said Santa 
Fe Vice President Robert Welk. "There isn't 
any halfway position. The reasons we gav~ in 
December are the same today." 

Santa Fe has maintained that more 
passenger trains would impede freight 
operations. 

Welk claimed that this was the first time his 
company, had denied a Caltrans request for 
new service . 

"We run 20 passenger trains statewide 
each day for Amtrak. We ' re not 
uncooperative. But the first time we don' t go 
along, we are painted with a black hat and 
that's not fair."

Lea Ruddee , Warren provost , said that at 
Warren's office, "We found that the traffi c was 
small enough to close a t lunch." 

T om Rutter, director of student financial 
servi~es, ~id that as a result of Armitage's 
meetmg With The Daily Guardian there is now a

When Third College Provost Joseph Watson 
was questioned about the lunchtime closings he

Doctor Surplus Confirmed 
BY MARK WIUiON 

There will be an oversupply 
of physiciana in the US by 
1990 that "could bring about 
an unprecedented ability to 
balance supply and demand 
for health services," a HEW 
report has found . 

The figures detailed in the 

The Daily' Guardian 

Science 
report released recently by 
HEW's Bureau of Health 
Professions say that between 
the years 1970 and 1978, the 
number of physician s 
increased 17 percent. At this 
rate of increase, the report 
projec ts that in 1990 there will 
be 600,000 doctors , while the 
number needed would range 
from 553,000 to 596,000, an 
oversupply of about 25,000. 

There is some controversy 
over the methodology used in 
deciding exactly what 
constitutes an oversupply . 
Congress' Office of Tech· 
nology Al6essment (OT A ) 
put out its own report claiming 
that the estimate of oversupply 
was too high. Although OT A 
does not necessarily disagree 
with HEW. figures, its report 
claims that " current 

projections are based on the 
assumption that physician 
productivity will remain 
constant to 1990," which is 
invalid according to the OT A 
report. 

In February, the AMA put 
out a discussion paper which 
projected the supply of doctors 
in the US through the year 
2000 to increase anywhere 
from 43 percent to 108 
percent from the 1975 supply 
of 354,572. 

Charles Spooner, Dean of 
Admissions at UCSD School 
of Medicine , notes that 
" recently , the American 
Society of Medical Colleges 
stated that enrollments were a t 
a record high leveL" He 
attributed this to the building of 
new teaching facilities and 
larger class sizes. 

The HEW's report concurs 
with Spooner, but also sites 
government support of 
enrollinent as another cause 
for increased enrollments. The 
report goes on to say that 
" while projec tions vary 
somewhat in their estimates of 
excess physicia n supply, it 
appears that the training 
capacity is adequate for 
meeting current and future 
needs. " 

The recent AMA report 
states that if the mix of current

Open House Shows Research 
BY R.C. GALIJAN 

Students and visitors at last Sunday's 
campus open house received rare peeks at 
research being conducted in various fields at 
UCSD. Topics of exhibits, lectures, and 
demonstrations ra nged from life and 
geochemistry of the deep ocean trenches, to 
moonrocks and space exploration outside of 
our solar system. 

Scripps Institute of Oceanography was well 
represented on the Third College campus with 
films and slide lectures, some of which focused 
on environments of the deep ocean trenches. 
The high temperatures and pressures make 
these newly studied areas unique in life forms 
and hydro·chemistry . 

Research being conducted by Dr. William 
Kristan on the nervous system of leeches 

prov.ided close·up examination of many 
species of bloodsuckers, prompting one viaitor 
to inquire, "Do they bite?" The answer did not 
deter several children from handling the 
creatures. 

Two of the more popular demonstrations 
were a glimpse at the microscopic world 
through an electron microscope in BOMer 
Hall. and art restoration by laser, with which 
Dr. James Asmus psed a pulaing laser to clean 
centuries of accumulated grit off a statue. 

The little known Center for Astrophysics 
and Space Sciences exhibited equipment used 
in gamma and X.ray astronomy, and 
attempted to explain the anatomy of Black 
Holes.

Cronkite: Anderson's VP? 
WASHINGTON (AP) -

Independent presidential 
candidate John Anderson is 
considering CBS anchorman 
Walter Cronkite as a running 
mate, and Cronkite, if asked, 
might accept, the New 
Republic Magazine reported 
Yelterday. 

"I'd be so honored to be 
asked, I wouldn't turn it 
down," Cronkite is quoted as 
saying in an interview with 
Morton M. Kondracke, the 
masazine's executive editor. 

An Anderson aide said the 
Illinois consressman has .not 
made a choice for second 
place on hi ticket. 

"No one, including 
Cronkite, has been approach-
ed about the poasibility. of 
nanning," said the aide, Mike 
Rosenbaum_ "This kind of talk 
is premature." 

A spokeswoman for CBS 
news said Yelterday that 
Cronkite is on vacation and 
was not immediately available 
for comment on the article. 

In the May 3 edition 
published yesterday, Kon-

dracke writes: 
" I've got some great news 

for John Anderson. Walter 
Cronkite, one of the people 
Anderson and his staff would 
most like to see as Anderson's 
running mate, just might do 
it. " 

Cronkite, who is retiring 
early next year as television 
anchorman on the CBS 
Evening News, often has been 
rat~ in poUs as one of the 
most trustworthy of Ameri-
cans. 

"No, I haven't entertained it 

for the moment," he replied. " I 
cannot say that there haven't 
been quite a few approaches 
from time to time from both 
political parties and from all 
spectrums of both parties. 

"The people who come to 
me to run for one office or 
another come perhaps with a 
good heart, but I feel most 
come with great cynicism," 
Cronkite added. "They clearly 
don't give a rap for what I 
stand for, but most want to 
explo!t, I ~essyou'dcallitmy 
notonety. 

Food Stamps May Stop 
WASHINGTON (AP)-

Agriculture Secretary Bob 
Bergland told governors 
yesterday "a suspension of all 
June food stamp ben~fits now 
is likely" Ilince Congress hali 
failed to provide additional 
money to operate the 
program. 

Bergland said in letters to 
the governors he told them 
Feb. 20 that "the food stamp 

program was facing a funding 
crisis" because of congression-
al delays. 

"Now, I regret I must inform 
you that the crisis is imminent, 
and that unless the Congress 
acts with extraordinary 
disratch in the next 1 7 days, I 
wil have to act on May 15 to 
order the suspension of all food 
stamp benefits, effective June 
1." he wrote.

Show Without a Lead 
Continued (rom page 2 

The non-traditional Hamlet 
(no Polonious) might be all 
right, but what will Laertes do? 
He'll probably take his money 
and spend it in the city like a 
damned fool. 

Ticket prices will be 
affordable because of a 
scheduled Old Globe benefit 
show'. Headlining it will be the 
Jackson Four, with a side hall 
appearance by the Dave 
Brubeck Duo. The Globe is 
also hoping to attract Bob 

Dylan, but God has already 
refused to perform with him on 
a charity stop, 

I have confidence that the 
Globe's bold, innovative 
stroke will advance theatre 
and catch on in rapidly 
modernizing San Diego, 

I'm not surprised that the 
Globe thought of this idea 
before anyone else. The 
management team has to be 
on its toes because they have 
understudies who can always 
replace them. 

Corporal Punishment Still 
Common in Most States 
Continued from page 2 
the Eighth Amendment 
prohibition against cruel and 
unusual punishment. 

That ruling, however , did 
not prevent abolitionists from 
working to have corporal 
punishment done away with in 
individual states, cities, towns 
and school districts. And, 
during the past couple of 
years, child-beating has been 
ended in, among other places, 
Portland, Oregon; Kalama-
zoo, Michigan; Urbana , 
Illinois; and Groton, 
Connecticut. 

Groups carrying on this 
battle to end child abuse in 
their schools point to New 
Jersey's statute as a clear 
model for what should be 
enacted elsewhere in the 
country. While prohibiting 
physical force against students 
for punishment or "motiva-
tion," the measure does allow 
a principal or teacher to use 

force in self-defense, to stop a 
disturbance threatening 
physical injury to others and 
"to obtain possession of 
weapons or other dangerous 
objects upon the person or 
within the control of a pupil." 

Need for 
Doctors Down 

Continued (rom page 4 
"80 percent of the starting 
class are going into a primary 
care speciality. They seem to 
be retrograding back to old 
times." 

It appears that the primary 
care specialities are taking 
over the functions of the 
general practitioner which as a 
speciality, has been on the 
decline.
