was robbed at gunpoint Friday 
afternoon in Parking Structure

and one of them confronted 
her when she reached her car. 
The alleged assailant then held 
a gun to her chest and 
demanded her money. After 
taking the woman's wallet and 
purse, he told her to get into 
her car, which he refused to 
do. He then told her to turn 
around and walk away. She

TUCSON, Ariz. - Five 
computers were stolen late 
Friday night from the Univer-
si ty of Arizona administration 
building. Police say this late t 
crime may be related to a 
tring of five or six robberies 

occurring across campus 
during recent months. School 
officials estimated that the 
stolen equipment was worth 
approximately $ 10,000. Like 
the previous cri mes, the 
thieves broke open a ground-
floor window to gain access to 
the building. In addition, 
investigator discovered a 
shoe print that seems to match 
one found at a previous crime 
site.

Caserio Says 
Special Requests 
Had 'No Impact' 
on Admissions 
QUERIES: Investigation 
shows recommendations did 
not result in unfair advantage 
By Ivan Delventhal 
News Editor 

Whether applying for a job or eeking uni-
versi ty admission, there is an old saymg that 
everyone knows: "If you've got trings, pull 
'em." 

However, UCSD officials announced last 
week that this familiar axiom carries no weight 
in the UCSD admissions process. 

Unsolici ted letters written on behalf ofUCSD 
app licants by prominent figure~, including U 
regent , legislators and busine smen, are '"re la-
tively few" in number and "have no impact 
whatsoever" on the admi sions decisions, a re-
cent campuswide study con finned. 

The investigation into VIP admis ion re-
quests was initiated several weeks ago follow-
ing similar inve ligations at UC Berkeley and 
UCLA, which uncovered numerou in tances 
of n n-UC-eligible students being admitted af-
ter "special requests" were made for them by 
prominent figures. 

"There have been no applicants on the gen-
eral campus, in the Graduate School oflnterna-
tional Relations and Pacific Studies, at Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography or in the medical 
school who have been admitted due to inquiry 
from or interest by prominent individuals," In-
terim Chancellor Marjorie Caserio wrote in an 
April 15 letter to UC Provost and Senior Vice 
President of Academic Affairs . Judson King. 

The UCSD study, which spanned from 1983 
to the present, identified 90 letters of recom-
mendation or inquiry fro m elected officials, 
university donors, regents, faculty, ~tudents, 
parents and business leaders. 

According to the resu lts of the inve tigation, 
25 student.s who had letters written on their 
behalf were accepted by UCSD. All of the e, 
according to UC officials, were UC eli gi ble. 

However, these numbers may not reflect all 
special admission requests because records of 
undergraduate and graduate students who are 
not admitted, or who are admitted and do not 
attend, are only retained for one year. In addi-
tion, the admissions files of undergraduate stu-
dents are held for only four years following

Revelle Security Officer Nearly Struck by Car in Parking Lot 
ASSAULT: UCSD 
police are following 
several leads in case 
By Terry Lew 
Associate News Editor 

Revelle College Residential Se-
curity Officer (RSO) Sally 
Chambless was almost struck by a 
speeding car Friday night in parking 
lot t03 on the Revelle campus. 

Chambless, who was leaning 
over a parked car while writing a 

Licket, said the other car "came 
within inches" of her. 

"I was bending over to look for the 
VIN [Vehicle Identification NumberJ, 
and a car approached me from be-
hind," she said. "I looked down, and 
there was a bumper next to my leg." 

Chambless estimated that the car, 
which UCSD Police Detective Doug 
O'Dell described as "a light-col-
ored Volvo station wagon," was 
moving at 20-2S miles per hour. The 
speed limit in campus parking lots is 
IS miles per hour. 

According to O'Dell, the driver 
left the parking lot after the inci-
dent. 

Although Chambless said she 
probably could not identify the 
driver, she said she definitely recog-
nized ihe car. 

'" know I cited him within the 
last two to three weeks," she said. "I 
wrote him a ticket for no-permit 
parking." 

O'Dell aid he has several leads 
in the case, which is officially listed 
as an assault with a deadly weapon 

- a violation of California Penal 
Code, Section 245. 

If a suspect is found, tried and 
convicted, he faces up to four years in 
state prison and up to a $10,000 fine. 

However, O'Dell said prosecu-
tors must prove the intent to cause 
serious injury in order to convict a 
suspect. 

"[The incident] could be as imple 
as the person driving the car [not 
seeing Chambless]," O'Dell said. '" 
can't discount that possibitity."

Marshall Senior Is 
'Right' on the Money 
WINNINGS: Kristin Barry takes home $27,000 in 
cash and prizes from 'The Price is Right' 
By Chris Schreiber 
Staff Writer 

Nothing quite compares to Ihe 
opportunity to act out a life-long 
fantasy . When Marshall senior 
Kristin Barry got a kiss from ''The 
Price is Right" host Bob Barker on 
April 22, she was on the brink of 
doing just that - she was aboullo 
become $27,000 richer. 

Barry, who was in charge of or-
ganizing an activity for seniors in 
the Pi Beta Phi sorority, said she has 
been an avid fan of 'The Price Is 
Right" since she was a little girl, and 
thought that being in the audience 
for a taping of the 
show would be ex-
citing. 

without exceeding that amount. 
On her first spin, Barry got 45 

cents, and before Baricer could even 
ask whether she wanted tospinagain, 
she had already started the wheel on 
its next rotation. It pun around and 
clicked over to 55 cents, winning 
Barry $1 ,000 and aplace in the Show-
case Showdown. 

For those unfamiliar with ''The 
Price Is Right," the Showcase 
Showdown is the portion of the 
show in which the two people who 
prevail in spinning the big wheel 
gel to bid on valuable prize pack-
ages. 

During an inter-
view before the 
show, following a 
friend's advice, 
Barry acted very 
hyper and excited. 
She also showed 
the producer the 
big sign she had 
made, which fea-
tured Snoopy (of 
"Peanuts" fame) 
and 'the words "Pi 
Phi's Love Bob-
Help Control the 
Pet Population." 
Apparently, the ad-
vice was right on 
the mQney, as 
Barry was the sec-
ond audience 
member to "come 

"I leaned over 
and told Bob 
(Bark.] how 
excited I was. 
lben, I asked 
him to Id .. me,

Because Barry 
had a higher total 
prize amount than 
the other finalist, 
she got to choose 
the showcase upon 
which she would 
bid. She passed on 
the first showcase, 
which included a 
trip to Las Vegas 
arnongitsprizes, in-
stead opting to see 
the contents of the 
second showcase. 

The second 
showcase featured

on down." 
"It was a dream 

come true," Barry 
said. " I complelely freaked oul. ... 1 
didn' t even say 'goodbye' to my 
friends. I just sprinted down the 
aisle and onto the stage." 

I Barry didn't win the firsl item 
thai was bid upon, but later won a 
dineue set and a chance to drive 
away in a new Jeep Wrangler. It 
was at that moment in the show 
when Barry received the faleful 
kiss. 

'" leaned over and told Bob 
[Barker) how excited' was," Barry 
said. '"Then, 1 asked him to kiss me, 
and he did. It was so cool." 

Tradition dictates that Barker 
is the one who receives the kiss 
from the female contestants - but 
apparently, this time hedidn 't mind 
making an exception. 

Barry did not win the jeep, as 
she failed to correctly guess its 
price. But as a showcase winner, 
she got a chance to spin the big 
wheel. To win at the big wheel, a 
contestant needs to come as close 
as possible to a value of one dollar 

_ KIt.tln Barry Barry estimated 
Marshall senior Ihat the package 

wa worth about 
$24,500. Knowing that one cannot 
win if ihe guess exceeds the actual 
price by even one dollar, Barry took 
$5OOoff of heres tim ate and guessed 
$24,000. The actual price was 
$24.479. 

She won the showcase and, more 
importantly for her, the car. Barry 's 
old car had just broken down the 
week before, and she had been bor-
rowing her mother's car while wait-
ing for her own to be repaired. Her 
friends rushed the stage as soon as 
the actual price was announced. 

"We all started huggi ng and cry-
ing and jumping up and down .... 1 
think they [the show's produce~] 
were afraid for Bob's life," Bury 
said. 

"We dogpiJed into the car .... It 
was just so wonderful," she added. 

Bury's winnings on ''The Price 
Is Right" totaled 527,796. When 
her father told her that she just 
moved up about two tax brackets, it 
didn't faze her in the least She had 
been able to live a dream.

Michael Levine, UCSD professor of biology, received 

the National Acaderrtf of Sciences AWfJ(d in Molecular 
Biology, an honor given to a young scientist who has made 
a recent notable discovery in moleculfJ( biology. In a 
ceremony held April 29 at the Academy's annual meeting 
in Washington D.C., Levine received a bronze medal and a 
$20,000 prize. 

Levine has devoted most of his CfJ(eer to studying the 
fruit ftyin an effort to identify the "master regulatory" genes 
which control development. More recently, Levine has 
studied a marine organism called the sea squirt. Because 
the notochord of a sea squirt is made out of only 40 cells, 
researchers can follow the development of each cell from 
its beginni~ at fertilization.

port for the new council. 

"I thinlc the fact that the new

contributing to her personal growth. 

"I' m laking a lot of things away

The new A.S. Council devoted the 

bulk of its first meeting to discussing

appointments and filled several vacant 
and interim positions and offices.

"In looking al the correspon-

UCSD Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Joseph Watson 
said he was "reassured" by the 
results of the UCSD inquiry into 
the integrity of the admission 
process. 

"It looks as if all students ad-
mitted to UCSD were done so by

Watson said. 

HI think that [special requests I

Fee Freeze Is a Baby Step 
In the Right Direction 

In a move long awaited by students and parents alike, 
members of the California State Assembly's Higher Education 
Committee took the first step towards alleviating the burden of 
ever-increasing tuitions by passing the California Affordability 
Act of 1996 on to the assembly for a vote. 

If approved by the California Assembly and Senate, the 
measure wi II go on the 1996 November ballot. The measure 
would freeze all fee hikes in the University of California, 
California State Universty and community college systems 
until June 30, 2000, after which they would be linked to 
inflation. Fee increases would not be allowed to go into 
effect unless the Slate General Funds revenues grow by less 
than 2.5 percent. 

The UC Student Association has come out against the fee 
freeze because they are afraid student services will be cut, 
and because they feel that freezing fees is not good enough. 
They want the fees rolled back. This all or nothing approach 
stands in the way of what could be a very good thing. The 
UCSA has a point that costs are currently too high, but the 
fee freeze is still a good idea - after all, it may be the first 
step to attaining the lower fees that are ultimately desired. 
The fee freeze should be strongly supported by students, as 
it will keep fees from becoming even more exhorbitant. The 
California Affordability Act of 1996 might not be perfect, 
but it's a baby step in the right direction.

COMMENTARY: Considering its long history of human-rights violations at home, the United States is in no 
position to intervene in other countries, especially when the true motive is often political, not humariitarian 

THE u.s. SHOULD STAY OUT OF CIllNA'S AFFAIRS 
By Neomi FIIIk 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Following the beaJing of iJlegal 
immigraAts by police in Riverside 
County, China recently spoke OUI 
againsl America's hypocritical p0-
sition on human rights. While we're 
quick to ignore Ihe rantings of a 
country infamous for poor treatment 
of its citizens, there is a large de-
gree of truth in China's condemna-
lion: The United Stales has been 
highly critical of China's human-
rights violations for decades, but it's 
no secret that America is guilty of 
many of the same atrocities. 

So as the United States threat-
ens to revoke China's Most Favored 
Nation status, shuns publicly one of 
the world's remaining communist 
countries and sends fleets of battle-
ships to "defend" Taiwan, our gov-
ernment needs to take a step back. 
In fact, it should seriously recon-
sider meddling in China's affairs at 
all. Why should the United States, 
in the case of China, tum in its 
badge as the world's policeman? 

First, U.S. intervention would be 
pure hypocrisy, as apparent in the 
Riverside beating and other recent 
examples. Secondly, and most im-
portantly, America's shameful his-
tory of intervention in other coun-
tries - and even more shameful 
reslllts - should be reason enough 
to avoid China altogether. Indeed, 
whi Ie the U.S. government has 
boasted about acting out of humani-
tarian concern, such as to protect 

people from persecution and death, 
its true motivation was almost always 
to overthrow communist regimes or 
to protect corporate interests. 

In the end, if the United States 
were truly concerned about protect-
ing Chinese lives, concerning itself 
with China would be defendable. But 
because the United States' primary 
motivation is politics - and because 
it overlooks heinous crimes against 
humanity within its own borders -
America simply shouldn't involve it-
self in China's affairs. 

China has long been on the re-
ceiving end of disruptive outside in-
fluences. 'The most heinous example 
of foreign imperialism was the 
Opium Wars of 1840-42. British 
companies encouraged millions of 
Chinese to become addicted to 
opium in order to turn a profit. Hor-
rified at the havoc that widespread 
opium addiction was wreaking upon 
the population and the country's in-
frastructure, the Manchu Govern-
ment moved to outlaw the drug. 
Unwilling to lose profits, Britain de-
clared war on China - a war they 
quickly won. Subsequently, Britain 
imported and sold opium freely in 
the country, resulting in the deaths 
of millions of Chinese. 

This is just one example of for-
eign imperialism in China. China's 
history of being plagued by foreign 
interests should be a sign to the 
United States that any kind of inter-
vention in the internal affairs of 
China should be approached with

numerous connicts over the las I 
century, and rarely for valid or jus-
lified reasons. It seems fair to be 
cautious about America's true inten-
tions in China after reviewing the 
United Stale's history of unwar-
ranted aggression. 

The government's involvement 
in South America, for example, was 
moti vated by greed and politics, not 
by any Iloble concern for the people 
in those countries. The United States 
became involved in EI Salvador and 
Nicaragua simply because it dis-
agreed with the left-wing govern-
ments in power. They supported 
rebels in EI Salvador and the 
Contras in Nicaragua, aiding their 
efforts to overthrow the existing, 
democratically elected govern-
ments. As Ronald Reagan put it, we 
didn't want any "communists in our 
backyard." 

At the same time, the United 
States allowed the exploitation of 
indigenous peoples in foreign coun-
trie by various American corpora-
tions. The American fruit company, 
Chiquita, contributed to the forma-
tion of an extreme socioeconomic 
stratification in EI Salvador, result-
ing in the creation of a permanent 
underclass. In South Africa, Ameri-
can-owned companies like Coca 
Cola fiscally supported apartheid 
and the oppression of black South 
Africans. Rarely has the United 
States stepped in to restrict thcse 
company 's actions for the good of 
humanity. 

Several years and a new admin-
istration later. one hopes that things 
have changed and that the United 
States wants to become involved in 
China because of a genuine concern 
about the human-rights violations 
which are occurring there. 

Unfortunately, this is not the 
case. The United States has demon-
strated by the connicts in which il 
chooses to become involved that 
factors such as politics and money 
always playa role. It is ever the 
more obvious that this is the case 
because of the careful seli!ction of 
countries in which the United States 
involves itself. For example, while 
the U.S. government has busied it-
self overChina, it has also stood idly 
by while millions of Rwandans 
were slaughtered in one of the worst 
atrocities of the 20th century. If hu-
manitarian interests were the pri-
mary worry, what rationale is there 
for intervening in one country and 
not another? 

The United States has embroiled 
itself in China's domestic matters 
for one reason: politics. China re-
mains one of the few communisl 
nations left surviving ~ince the end 
of the Cold War, and the United 
States would delight in exorcising 
the communist devil from China 
and the rest of the world, 

Ultimately, China was correct in 
identifying the U.S. hypocrisy. We 
were quick to cri ticize China 's hu-
man-rights vio lations when the

Continued from pac. 4 
of the most ardent Republicans. 
His desperation to ridicule the 
Democrats has lowered him to re-
markable depths. Consider, for in-
stance, a piece he did on Hillary 
Clinton. The overwhelming rel -
evance to politics and important 
issues will be quite apparenl. 
Limbaugh showed a clip of Mrs. 
Clinton speaking at a banquet for 
a charity. While speaking , s he 
made a lighthearted reference to 
how she can' t even figure out how 
to work her VCR. 

Limb~ugh was dumbfounded. 
He spent the next 10 minutes be-
rating the first lady on how stupid 
she must be for not being able to 
work a VCR. How can we have 
sueh an ignoramus as our first 
lady? What a blight upon our en-
tire government. 

Surely, there must be more im-
portant issues to address. I only

same violations arc a regular occur-
rence in our own backyard . Our 
police Qfficers abuse their power 
and beat people, innocent or nOl, on 
a regular basis - that these crimes 
are sometimes captured on video is 
the only unusual event. 

Everyday, people in America are 
systematically oppressed. Women, 

wonder if the audience joined 
Limbaugh in laughter to make him 
feel good or because they too de-
spised the first lady for her igno-
rance of modem technology. 

Ironically, Limbaugh's overrid-
ing attitude is similar to that of his 
opposition whom he hopes so ve-
hemently to defeat: pure intoler-
ance of opposing views . Don't 
ever let a politician or activist get 
away with saying we should open 
up our minds to consider other 
views, becau e nothing could ever 
be further from their minds. In the 
end, Limbaugh is saying the same 
thing as hi s opponents : Never 
compromi se, never waver, and 
never consider working together 
to solve a problem. 

But remember what 
Limbaugh's ultimate goal is: All 
he wants to do is criticize the lib-
erals. This requires no compro-
mise or cooperation. 

Unfortunately, this approach 
hurts the Republican party two-
fold . In the first place, Limbaugh 
stands tall as a representative of 
the entire party. This gives the 

children and people of color - who 
make up the majority of the poor -
are robbed of opportunities. Despite 
the existence of financial-aid pro-
grams, the poor are still kept out of 
systems of higher education, mainly 
because of the system 's inability to 
equip them with an adequate pri-
mary education . Add to this mix a 
new kind of egregation in Ameri-
can society: The unequal distribu-
tion of funds and resources in pri -
mary schools. These are real human-
rights violations.

Hence, they hold Rush Limbaugh 
up as a frightening example. 

For anyone who doubts that the 
media is liberal, just consider the 
way they handled two millQr events 
over the past few years. When Dan 
Quayle misspelled potato in an el-
ementary school classroom, the en-
tire country couldn't wait to shout 
him down. Clearly, he was unfit for 
the vice-presidency. 

But this past month, the media 
conveniently ignored a much more 
embarrassing gaffe by President 
Clinton. While attending the fu-
neral of Ron Brown , Clinton 
emerged from behind a van, laugh-
ing and smiling with his friends. 
However, when he noticed to his 
horror that there were ca meras 
around, hi s smile quickly fa~ed 
and was replaced by an obviously 
fake wince, sniffle and tears . 

While Limbaugh naturally 
played the tape hundreds of times 
to his audience's delight, where 
was this story in the rest of the 
media? Absolutely nowhere. But 
if it had been a Republican politi-
cian, you can bet that we would 

a recent Children's Defense Fund 
report , a child in Mexico has a 
greater chance of getting all of his 
vaccinations than a child in the 
United States. Considering that we 
are not a poor, third-world country, 
but rather one of the wealthiest na-
tions in the world, these problems 
are inexcusable. It is time they were 
addressed. 

There is only one justifiable rea-
son for the United States to involve 
itself in China's affairs: to protect 
human rights and lives. Admittedly, 
violations againstlhe human rights

have seen plenty of it. 
However, it is not just the me-

dia that tras a low opinion of 
Limbaugh. The average citizen, 
Democrat or Republican, has a 
tendency to equate Limbaugh with 
the GOP. This can only hurt the 
party. Instead of seeing a party 
with genuine goals, the public -
including members of the Repub-
lican Party - see a party devoted 
to bashing the opponent and play-
ing silly childhood games. 

Limbaugh 's misdirec ted ap-
proach takes away from his true 
stance on the issues, some of which 
arc worthwhile, especially his views 
on the economy and limiting gov-
ernmental intervention. Instead of 
using his position of power and ac-
cessibility to help push the e ideas, 
he ruins hi s reputation by engaging 
in vengeance. This strips him of 
credibility altogether, and subse-
quently prevents anyone from see-
ing his ideas as anything but radi -
cal, right-wing rantings. It's time for 
Limbaugh to lighten up and refocus 
his agenda. Unless, of course, he 's 
just in it for the money. 

of Chinese are being committed, but 
thi s is not the real reason for U.S. 
involvement. 

The real reason is America's dis-
like and fear of communism. The U.S. 
government has cloaked its political 
motivations in the rhetoric of human i-
tarian concem for the Chinese. If we 
are to playa role in world affairs, then 
our involvemcnt must be equilateral 
and con istent. We will find ourselves

STAR-STUDDED CAST EXPLORES 
LOS ANGELES MURDER MYSTERY 

HE NEW STAR'DRIVEN FILM, 
Mulholland Falls, was 
named after a cliff over-
looking Los Ange-
les where crime 
busters allegedly . 
went to di spose of 

criminals. Perhaps this film 
should have been tossed over 
the edge as well. Even with a 
cast of accomplished actors, 
thi s lackluster movie offers 
nothing new in the way of excitement 
or suspense. 

Set in 1950s Los Angeles, Falls 
focuses on a four-man police team, 
called ''The Hat Squad," comprised of 

Nick Nolte, Chazz Palminteri , Michael 
Madsen and Chris Penn. 

Despite a captivating scene that opens 
the film, the ensuing plot is as 
predictable as it is disappointing 
- not to mention extremely 
complicated. 

In short. the victim in the 
opening scene (Jennifer Connel-
ly) is found to have had an affair 
with the Hat Squad's leader, 
Max Hoover (Nolte). The plot 

then progresses - if it can be called that 
- to an Anny general. played by John 
Malkovich, who is an integral member of 
a top-secret military operation, of

Sunset Park 
ers on their 1991 debut. In fact, the 
group seems to have become more 
socially conscious over the past 
few years. Songs such as "The 
World is a Ghetto" and "Hold it 
Down," which focus on the mental, 
physical and economic perils of 
living in crime-ridden H-Town, 
manage to throw down smooth 
basslines and sly samples that keep 
the album from getting too serious. 

Portrayal of inner-city basketball 
team offers little realism 

Gelo Boys

IIIp-A-llllltlO Try •• R_'I 

-

As the East and West Coasts 
continue to feud for hip-hop 
supremacy, Houston's Geto Boys 
are stuck in the geographic middle 
of the fray. Accordingly, the 
group's latest album breaks no new 
ground, resulting in a Midwe t 
kind of effort. 

The Geto Boys have cleaned up 
their act to some extent, cutting 
back on the psychopathic and wan-
ton violence which hocked Iisten-

Five years removed from their 
debut, the Geto Boys no longer 
brag about being the perpetrators 
- they're now the commentators 
on the perils of the ghetto. 

Musically, the group has taken 
so liberally from the slinky West 
Coast Dogg Pound sound that at 
times Willie D's baritone - not Dr. 
Dre's - seems to drawl over the 
keyboards and heavy bass lines. As 
a result, the Geto Boys have lost 
the uniqueness which, at one time, 
made them the leaders of the pack. 
Now, they seem content to follow 
the crowd.

Over the last decade, a sizable 

number of films have 
offered bleak , yet 
fra nk, representations 
of inner-city life. 

Sunset Park exam-
ines urban poverty 
from a slightly newan-
gle, as it centers on a 
group of high school 
basketball players. 

As the film opens. the basket-
ball team has a few problems to 
work out before its new season 
begins. In the previous years , the 
squad dwindled in last place with 
an uncommilled coach and 
unmoti vated players. To make 
matters worse, it now has no 
coach for the upcoming season.

Enler Estelle (Rhea Perlman), 
a high schoolteacher who leaves 
an unfulfilling job in an inner-

city school to tackle 
the position as the head 
coach of the Sunset 
Park basketball team. 

The jaded players 
completely ignore 
Perlman' direction, 
triggering her desire to 
earn their respect. 

As the sea on pro-
gresses, she slowly gain their 
admiration and forges a winning 
team. 

In addi ti on to her on-the-court 
involvement with the team, she 
soon becomes a major part of the 
players' lives outside of basket-
ball . 

While thi s metamorphosis is 

inspiring, it is somewhat unreal-
istic, despite the efforts of direc-
tor Steve Gomer to create a cred-
ible story. 

It is hard to believe that the 
Sunset Park team could move 
from dead last the previous sea-
son ·tb the regional champi -
onships at Madison Square Gar-
den the next - a wild stretch at 
best. In fact . Perlman's interac-
don with her players' personal 
lives is the only believable part 
of this fi 1m. 

Ultimately, the film deals with 
such i sues as gang conflicts and 
the wasted talents of disadvan-
taged inner-city students. But in 
the end, the film' s lack of realism 
hamper it overall success. 

Suruet Park is playing at the-
aters around San Diego.

FALLS: Los 
Angeles murder 
c.tInued from P8I8 HI 
which the murder is a significant 
pan. 

The commercial trailers for the 
film mislead the audience into 
believing it is a "whodunit" murder 
mystery. However. the story cen-
ters on Nolte's character. Most of 
the screen lime is devoted to mak-
ing the audience empathize with 
Hoover's grief and his infidelity. 

With Melanie Griffith playing 
the one-dimensional part of Mrs. 
Katherine Hoover, and Malkovich 
taking on the role of a sterilized 
psuedo-intellectual, Ihe actors 
seem to be walking ai mles Iy 
through their parts in earch of the 
check-disbursement office. ln fact, 
Palminteri is the only cast member-
who gives an inspired perfor-
mance. 

Ironically, the murder victim, 
the only somewhat ' interesting 
character dies a few minutes into 
the film - a strong indication that 
character development isn't too 
important in Falls. 

At the end of the movie, several 
questions are left unanswered, 
most notably, the murderer 's 
motive. Even more befuddling is 
the "relationship" between the 
murder case and the film title. 

Mulholland Falls uffers 
through an anti-climactic and over-
wroughl plOl, and in Ihe end, it 
takes its cast as well as the audi-
ence down with it. It i playing in 
theatres around San Diego.

On a Quest 
Van Damme makes unimpressive 

directorial debut 
By DM Sweeney 
Senior Staff Writer 

Every so often, a film hits the theaters that 
is so contrived, so utterly 
mediocre, that its unimpressive-
ness is impressive. The Quest, 
Jean-Claude Van Damme's direc-
torial debut, is worthy of such dis· 
tinction. 

While Van Damme was only 
partly to blame for his past disap-
pointments (Sudden Death, Ttme-
cop. Universal Soldier), The Quest 
is completely his fault . In the film, the for-
mer kickboxing champion badly rehashes 
some of his previous works, namely 81000-
sport and Street Fighter - movies that 
aren't any good to begin with. 

It is laughable that Van Damme receives 
co-story credit for The Quest's paper-thin 
plot. Now, stop me if you 've heard this one 
before: Chris Dubois (Van Damme) travel 
to a lost city somewhere in the Orient 10 spar 

with the world's greatest fighters in no-
holds-barred, hand-Io-hand combat. To the 
winner goes a giant dragon sculpture made 

of solid gold. 
On the way, Dubois hooks up 

wilh the mischievious Captain 
Dobbs (Roger Moore) and his 
sidekick Harry, who plan to steal 
the golden statue. Thrown into the 
mix is the movie's only female 
character, Carrie Newton, who has 
a Whopping two line of dialogue 
and serves absolutely no purpose 

whatsoever. 
From the get-go, it's obvious that Van 

Damme will kick everybody's ass, so the 
only intrigue lies in how he will accomplish 
this - unfonunately, he and the film receive 
absolutely no help from the inane script. 

As for Van Damme's direction, it's dread-
ful enough to make college film majors 
cringe. Excessive slow-motion sequences 
painfully drag out countless fight scenes,

UCSD CLUB SPORTS ROUND-UP 
Ultimate Disc 
The UCSD hosted the men' s 

sectionaIs Ioomament forultimatedisc 
this past Saturday at North Fields. The 
______ B team 

~ struggled in the 
.::::::. early rounds 

losing three of its games. including a 
heartbreaking 15-13 defeat at the hands 
of UCLA. However, in its final game 
team members were able to gamer a 
win over USC, 15-5. 

The A team started quickly, with 
wins over Northern Arizona and Oc· 
cidental. But in its semi·final contest, 
a slow start doomed its chances against 
a strong Cal Poly.SLO squad. 

The final match of the day pit· 
ted the Squids against the Univer· 
sity of Arizona. Though UCSD 
dominated early play , the game 
ended in a 15-15 tie. Playing the 
sudden·death overtime in near· 
darkness. UCSD used a long pass 
from Chris Wea ver to Bryan Qualls 
to pull off the victory . 

Both the A and B squads will ad· 
vance to regionals in Santa Cruz on 
May 4-5. The A team is confident that 
its hard work and practice will payoff. 
Despite losing team· leader Chris 
Weaver to a back injury, the Squids 
believe they have a good chance at 
knocking off both favored Santa Bar· 
bara and Stanford. 

"Everyone else needs to step up in 
order to·fi II the shoes of the mighty, 
yet injured, Chris Weaver," Tyson 
Clark said.

In the Triton wo~n's lacrosse 
team's entire history, it had never 
managed to defeat its rivals from 

., 

UC Santa Barbara . 
• Well, so much for his· 

tory. 
After toppling the Gau· 

chos April 20th in its final 
game of the season, the UCSD 
squad faced off against them in the 
first round of the playoffs last Sun· 
day. The Tritons again were victo· 
rious, defeating the Santa 
Barbarans, 10-8, to advance to this 
weekend 's western lacrosse league 
Final Four which will be held here 
at UCSD. 

The first half of the game was 
dominbated by UCSD. Led by the 
1-2 scoring punch of Shannon 
Northrup (four goals) and Sian 

roes shone for the Triton peddlers. 
Dave Edwards, invisible for much 
of the season, sprinted to first· 
place finish in the Men 's C cat· 
egory. An elated Eri k Stauber also 
garnered himself a victory, turn·

mates into personal glory.

Beilock (three goals). the Tritons 
leapt to an 8-4 halftime advan· 
tage. Despite a strong second half 
from the Gauchos, the Tritons held 
a two-goal lead when the final gun 
sounded. 

The UCSD defensive effort was 
anchored by goalie Kristin Madigan 
whose 10 saves and powerful en· 
thusiasm combined more of an ob· 
stacie than UCSB could overcome. 
Madigan was supported by the de· 
fensive prowess of Tina Majoros, 
Sarabeth Horspod and Brit Glasser, 
all of whom patrolled the goal area. 
On the offensive end, Chris Moll, 
Katie Galvin and Cara Burke each 
contributed a goal. 

The win cemented the Tritons 
as the number·two ranked team in 
the southern region behind only 

sweep in the event. Katrina Berger 
also had a fruitful weekend, win· 
ning the criterium on both Satur· 
day and Sunday with strong fin · 
ishing sprints. 

But even with many individual 
successes , UCSD couldn ' t turn the 
relatively small fields into team 
victories. 

"We were short [onlthe num· 
bers, not the power," disgruntled 
racer Dave Shurig, winner of two 
silvers, said. "U nfortunately, sec· 
ond place is the first loser." 

Cycler Dan Senada brough t 
home a third·place finish despite 

the University of Arizona. Com· 
ing from the north to compete in 
the Final Four will be Berkeley 
and UC Davis. UCSD's first step 
toward a possible title will be 
against the squad from Cal. AI· 
though Berkeley holds the num· 
ber·one seed in the north, the Tri · 
tons will have the home· field ad· 
vantage when the game gets un· 
derway at the North Campus fields 
at 2 p.m. this Saturday. 

In addition to all that excite· 
ment, fi ve members of the team 
were selected to travel back east 
for an all·star tournament against 
several teams from the east coast. 
The five Tritons who will be going 
are Beilock, Northrup Moll, 
Manjoros and Madigan .

Unfortunately, determination 
gave way to disappointment as the 
Tritons lost to UCSB by five points 
on Saturday and by an even greater 
margin on Sunday. 

Though the Tritons were hop· 
ing for nine wins by this weekend, 
they seuled for seven victories and 
three second· place finishes . Fri· 
day, they head off to Chico for 
regionals races.

Crusaders Convert Tritons 
SWEPT: UCSD's make-up games against Point 
Lorna proved to be a rough affair 
By Mike Stance 
Staff Writer 

What a difference a week 
makes. After dismantling two Di· 
vision III squads last week, the 
Triton softballers were completely 
overmatched by NAlA Point Loma 
Nazarene College. The UCSD of· 
fense and defense struggled, 
as the Tritons fell , 7-0 and 
IO·\. 

In the first game, fresh· 
man pitcher Sarah Burns (6-
14) allowed only two earned 
runs, but it was more than 
enough to beat the fumbling 
Tritons. UCSD made fourer · 
rors in the contest, allowing to an 
additional five Crusaders to cross 
the plate. 

The Tri tons' offense couldn't get 
past Poi nt Lorna starting pitcher Jen-
nifer Jessen. who silenced the UCSD 
bats with seven innings of shutout 
work. 

The Tritons only managed three 
hits off the Crusader ace, as she 
pushed her record to 11 -7 for the 

season. 
In the second game, Point Lorna 

took advantage of some early Triton 
errors to put two runs on the board in 
the first inning. The Crusaders in· 
creased the lead to four just two 
innings later, when Molly Yanity 
knocked in a couple extra runs with 

a two·out single in the third. 
Meanwhile, Point Lorna 

pitcherTashaEgan wascruis-
ing, as the hurler tallied 10 
strikeouts while only giving 
up two hits. 

The Tritons' lone run of 
the afternoon came when se· 
niorthird·baseman Christine 

Mann was hit by a pitch, advanced 
to second on a wild shot and later 
scored on a si ngle by shortstop Missy 
Belmer. 

The two losses to Point Lorna 
dropped UCSD to 11 -28 this sea· 
son. The last game of the year will 
be a 12 p.m. doubleheader this Sal· 
urday, as the Tritons host Chapman 
University - last year's national 
champion.

Battered Tritons Get the Point 
By Rebln Kezlrlan 
Staff Writer 

It came down to the wire, but 
the UCSD women's tennis team 
fell just one match short of victory 

against Point Lorna 
Nazarene on Mon· 
day. The Tritons, 
suffering from the 
absence of three of 
their top six players 
due to Injury, 
claimed four of the 
seven three·set 

matches before eventually being 
ousted by the Crusaders, 5-4. 

"The match couldn't have been 
any doser," Head Coach Liz 
LaPlante said. "The girls_ who 
played, played well; but not having 
everybody healthy hun us." 

Miki Kurokawa and Yumi 
Talcemoto both opted not to play in 
the match, having missed nearly a 
week of practice due to injuries. 
Annie Hoecker, who has had a nag· 
ging foot injury throughout the sea· 
son, did not return to doubles after 
losing her singles contest, 6-2, 2-6, 
6-4.

a title contender.

Although top·seeded Triton 
Michelle Malephansakul was de· 
feated by her Crusader counter· 
part, Hilary Somers and Susan 
Huberman rose to the occasion, 
clai ming victories at the number· 
two and number-three positions, 
respectively . 

Somers, confident in her new 
ingles position, won the first set 

quickly, 6-3. After relinquishing 
the second set in the tie·brealcer, 
Somers outplayed her Point Lorna 
opponent in the third, taking the 
set, 6-3. Huberman, who usually 
occupies the fifth singles po ition, 
bested her Crusader competitor, 6-
4. 4-6,6-2. 

Freshman Kaala Potashnick 
went down quickly in the first set 
of her match, but she fought hard in 
the second before finally losing in 
the tie·brealcer. 

"Even though she lost, Kaala 
played the best she has played all 
year," laPlante said.

women were three·set victors in two , 
of their three outings, but the young 
third·seeded duo Amilta 1auhal and

Buehler, meanwhile, finished 
the preliminarics in a dead heat 
with Adam Brandt of Cal State

ball an impressive distance of 
51.7m to ti e for eighth. Buehler

"We didn ' t have everyone play· 
ing, so the 10 s wasn't disappoint·

first round, the Tritons will face

P RT---
Tritons Taclde West's Best 
81G nME: UCLA and 
Stanford were among 
the competition at state 
By D8n Kraft 
Sports Editor 

Three years ago, collegiate track-
and-field coaches from California 
and Nevada had a vi ion. Their goal 

was to create a cham-
pionship meet of pre-
viously unseen cali-
ber, bringing together 
the be t athletes from 
NCAA teams of all 
divisions for two 
day of intense com-
petition. 

The re ult was the California! 
Nevada Collegiate State Track and 
Field Championships, held last 
weekend at UC Davis. In attendance 
were 30 top schools, including uch 
powers as Stanford, UCLA and Cal. 

UCSD chose to attack the upe-
riorcompetition with only those ath-
letes who the coaching staff felt 
were of NCAA championship cali-
ber, thu~ better preparing them for 
the upcoming national meet. 

''This meet was equal ifnot more 
c mpetiti ve than the national cham-
pionships," Triton sprinter and 
jumper Lisa Shepard said. " It was 
delinitely a different environment." 

A multi-event talent - Shepard 
- who is still only weeks removed 
fromarthroscopickneesurgery , was 
among the Tritons selected to com-
pete. She rose to the occasion in 
Saturday's preliminary-round ac-
tion, notching her best post-surgery 
distance of 37' 6" in the triple jump. 

''I'm getting back to 100 percent, 
definitely," Shepard said. "[ wa 
behind1the board [on that jump), so 
I know'I can jump longer." 

Shepard took to the track later in 
the afternoon and finished ninth 
overall in the preliminary rounds of

meet. 
the 100-meter hurdles with a sea-
son-best time of 14.43. 

"I felt more relaxed [against such 
tough competition]," Shepard said. 
"They pull me along. I kind of thrive 
on it , actually. My coach [Wes Wil-
liams) thinks I have a pretty good 
chance [at nationals] if 'the gods are 
with me' as he ays." 

UCSD's best events of the two-

day competition were the hammer 
throw and the men's 1,500. In the 
hammer, it was Tara Monahan and 
Randy Buehler who held the Tri-
ton banner. After fouling on her 
lirsttwo preliminary attempts in a 
fierce wind, Monahan came up 
with a clutch throw of 45.60 
meters . From there Monahan said

Polo Qualifies for Nationals 
By Chris Lee 
Staff Writer 

Success has always been as-
sociated with the UCSD women 's 
water polo program, and this 
year's squad was not about to lei 
that winning tradition stop. 

Although their record dropped 
to 12- 13 after the heartbreaking 
10 s to San Diego State on Fri-
day, the Triton felt confident 
and optimistic entering the 
Western Qualification 
Tournament last weekend 
at UCLA. 

The Triton , facing the 
toughest competition all 
season, played well 
enough against some of the 
nation 's top teams to 
qualify for the USA Water Polo 
Nationals in May . 

UCSD gol off to a great start, 
crushing the Loyola Marymount 
squad in its first game, 19-2. With 
third-ranked UC Berkeley next on 
the schedule, however, the Tritons 
didn ' t have too much time to cel-
ebrate. They soon found out why 
the Golden Bears were ranked so 
high, losing, 10-1 . A good fir t 
half was followed by a horrendous 
second half, a UCSD was 
outscored, 7-0. 

Saturday did not look to be 
any easier with San Diego State 
and UC Santa Barbara on the 
schedule, and the Tritons knew 
they had to make a move to avoid 
a pressure game on Sunday in 
order to qualify . 

In the first game, the score 
was 5-2 in favor of the Aztecs at 
the half. The Tritons squandered 
some scoring opportunities in the 
second stanza and eventually fell, 
10-4. Now 1-2 in the tournament, 
the UCSB game became a must-
win si tuation for UCSD. 

If the Tritons beat UCSB, they 
would finish no worse than sixth 

and would qualify for the nation-
als, but if they lost, it would bring 
up a game on Sunday that they 
would have to win to qualify . 
UCSD rose to the challenge, de-
feating Gauchos by a score of 8-
5. 

"We really wanted to win that 
game and earn that spot in na-
tionals," Triton Head Coach 
Denny Harper said. "We ex-

ecuted our game plan 'and 
did what we had to do to 
come away with the vic-
tory ." 

In one of the most ex-
citing games all weekend, 
UC Santa Barbara got as 
close as 7-5 with about 
three minutes remaining in 

the game, but Shawna 
Caballero's rebound goal off her 
own miss put UCSD up by three 
- a lead they would never relin-
quish . Fre hman goalie Alice 
Huszcz' s outstanding play dur-
ing this game gave UCSD an 
opportunity to play in nationals. 

"I personally think that I 
played the be t game of my life 
against UCSB," Huszcz said af-
terwards. "Our team defense was 
really strong, and it was a team 
effort which gave us the win." 

With the national tournament 
bid secured, UCSD played UC 
Davis on Sunday in the fifth place 
game and lost, 7- 1. As a result, 
the Tritons left UCLA in sixth 
place overall, and look ahead to 
May 10, when they begin NCAA 
Nationals against second-ranked 
Slippery Rock and Michigan 
University. 

"Our offense was weak attimes, 
and we really have to work on our 
scoring, but I'm excited about our 
chances in the toumamenl," Harper 
said. "The team is playing well 
now, and we just want to carry that 
into nationals." 

Tritons Stomp Point Lorna en Route to NCAA Regionals 
By Nicole Sunderland 
Staff Writer 

The last time the UCSD men's 
tennis team took on Point Lorna, the 
Tritons lost a close match. But when 
the lwoteams met last Tuesday , Point 
Lorna was one Crusader short of a 
challenge for UCSD. 

With regionals just a wed\ away, 
the racketeers from La 10lla proved 
again they are the ones to beat, as they 
slaughtered Point Lorna, 6-1. 

"After we lost the first time, we 
were ready to play well and get a little 
revenge," number-one singles player 
Mike Wilson said.
