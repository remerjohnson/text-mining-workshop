Parking debt 
drains budget 
By JOHN SHAW. SenIOr Staff Wnter 

By the end of 1988, UCSD wtll owe over $1.5 million for the 
construction of parking facilities alone. 

By tate law, the only means by which the university may pay this sum 
IS to collect revenue from users - through meter and permit income. 
~eters account for approximately $267,000 of the Parking and 
Transportation Office's current $2.5 million budget, while parking 
permits for students, faculty and staff bring in about $2.2 million annually. 

"The majority of our income goes to debt service. It's the largest Single 
Item In our budget," aid Parking and Transportation Manager Robert 
Umstead. 

Immediately after new parking facilities are completed, the Parking 
Office must begin to pay for them. 2,000 new spaces will be completed 
this summer. 

"[The debt servi el will go up gradually over the next year as new 
facilities are completed. [Consequently 1. the budget Will increase." 
Umstead said. 

The income gained from meters and permits is also used to cover 
operation costs, which Include the salaries of the parking representatives 
and administrators whl h are approximately $1 1 million annually. 
1ai mcnance and supply costs are close to $1 million. 

Though CltaOOns accoum for over $300,000 of the office's annual 
InLOme, state law prohibits the use of this income to pay for the 
construction or debt payment of parking facilities. Instead, it is used to 
fund the Alternative Transporation y tern, which includes program 
u h as. the shuttle to the medical cemer, the van pool program, car pool 

coordlnanon, the printing of bus hnes and bicycle paths, and the partial 
fundi ng of the free San Diego Tran It bus passes provided to students. 

According to Supervisor of Management Operations Howard Finnecy, 
between 45,000 to 50,000 citations are given a year. Six parking 
representatives work each weekday and each averages 30 Citations a day. 
Most of thosegivenare $14 tickets for expired meters or no permit. 

UCSD's learance rate of parkmg citations 1 89 percent A ticket is 
considered cleared when it IS paid, canceled, voided, sent to court, or 
processed at the Department of Motor Vehicles. The 11 percent that are 
not resolved are Issued to vehicles that have been subsequently sold, 
junked or relocated to another state . 

The penalty for not paying a citation can result in added fines and 
di fficulty In vehicle regIstration. 20 days after the ticket is issued, the fine 
doubles. After 30 more days, the citation is reponed to the DMV and a $10 
processing fee is added to the total fine. The vehicle cannot be registered 
until all accumulated citations are paid. 

By failing to pay the most expensive ticket - illegally parking in a 
handicapped space - the $54 fine could double, be assessed an added 
$10 fee and finally result in a $118 ticket. 

Finnecy has a philosophy for why tickets are given out: "The college 
system indicates that parking is a service paid by the user. I feel strongly 
that people with permits deserve places to park. We are trying to protect 
those spaces." See PARKING. page 3 

Irym ~Guarduut 
Over $300,000 are collected each year from Citations.

TKE alias causes suspension 
By JAMES P. PINPIN. taff Wnter 

The Tau Kappa Epsilon (TKE) 
Fraternity has been suspended 
from UCSD student organization 
status due to violations by Its 
members of the university's 
tudem Conduct Code. 
According to Tom Tucker, Vice-

Chancellor of Undergraduatc 
Affairs/ University Center, the TKE 
Fraternity violated section 6-A of 
the tudent conduct code 
involVing dishonesty and misuse 
of umversity identification. 

On ov. 14, 1986 at the 
Fabulous Inns and on Feb. 19, 
1987 at the La Jolla Marrtot Hotel, 
member of the TKE Fraternity 
reserved facihties under the name 
"UCSD Pre-Professionals OCICty." 

Tu ker aId that the TKE 
Fraternity, via its rcpre nwtlve, 
TKE PreSident ian MCGill, ha 
admitted gUIlt to the violatlon of 
the studcnt conduct code on both 
o caSSlOn An informal resolutlon 
wa reached betv.:een the fraternity 
and Torn Tucker regardmg the 

lnctll)!1S impo ed a PUnl hment

entrance to fraternity counCil 
member hlp , pam Ipatlon m 
RU H, parti Ipatlon in Intramural 

sport activities, and use of UCSD 
identification as a registered 
student organtzatlon. 

Tucker said that the 
rein tatmem of TKE Will depend 
on the TKE's successful 
completion of the conditions of 
this agreement 

McGill pointed out that the only 
reason why they mi represented 
themselves as the "UCSD Pre-
Profes ionals" was because it is 
mu h more difficult to acquire 
reservations under a fraternity 
name 

"We're wllhng to cooperate 
[and I I think it' [the punishment) 
a fair a can be expected," 
McGill S<lld "We're baSIcally In a 
growmg Greek system nght now 
and wc 're pretty much a

The umver Ity s action consl t 
only of punt hmg vlOlatlon of the 
tudent condu t code. Other fa et 

of the Marriott m Idem would be a 
police matter, Tucker said 

That inCident, according to 
Steve Winning, Marriott resident 
manager, IS still an open case. The 
police are stili In the process of 
investlgatlon, however, no 
evidence ha been uncovered 0 
far. ·We'd like to find out who the 
re ponslble party IS and have 
restitution [for approximately 
$JO ,OOO worth of damages)," 
Winning said. 

"As far as I know, Investigatlon -
are at a stand tlll," McGill said . He 
explatned that the police have 
gone a far a lettlng Wltnesse 
pOtnt out speCific TKE membl?rs, 
fingerprinting those members, and 
then que tlontng them. M Gill aid 
that fingerprint compan on results

The Parking OlTice se lls more 
pennits than there are spaces on

Income. 

In March, 1,390 "A" pennits 
were sold for the 975 "An spaces-
a 43 percent overse ll. 2.194 "B" 
permits were sold for "8" spaces-
a 60 percent oversell, The office 
oversold "5" permits by 38 per ent 
5,290 "5" spaces were available for 
the 7,284 pennits that were SClld . 

According to Umstead , thiS

Some Parking Facts 
• Each parking 
representative gives an 
average of 30 Citations a 
day 
• By 1988, the Parking 
Office Will have a debt 
service of $1 5 million 
• Student parking permits 
Will increase to $1 17 next 
year. 
• 2,000 " S" spaces will be 
added this summer, 
• North Torrey Pllles Road 
will be red-lined in July. 
• Parking permits generate 
$2,2 million of income, 

In an effort to ra ise fund s to help 
payoff the debt incurred from the 
construction of parking facilitie s, 
all mne month penni ts will 
Illcrease $9. "A" pennits will 
increase to $189, "8" pennitS to 
$162 and "5" pennitS to $117. 
Graduate students have the option 
of purchasing a "8" or "5" pennit , 
but most, accordlllg to Finnecy Opt 
for the lower priced "5· permit. 

In addition to increasing permit 
prices, the Parking Office is 
looking into the feaSibility of 
extending me time peri<Xl in 
which permits WIll be needed to 
park on campus. 

'There 's a lot or people parklllg 
free and they tcar up the parking 
lots JUSt like we do, so a lot of the 
maintcnance money that you and 1 
are paying in our parking pennit is 
to suppOrt people who are parking 
free ," Umstead said, 

Originally, it was proposed that 
the hours be extended to 10 pm 
starting July 1; however, Umstead 
said me extension will not be 
implemented that soon, 

"It 's not going to happen inJuly, 
but sometime next year it will 
probably go to that. We have to 
find out all the groups of people 
that it effects and how it's gOi ng to 
have to be !>et up to make it work.

Ms. Chddwcll has, Il seems, becn 
m the paper fa irly frequent ly 
rece ntly regardmg her cancella-
tions of vanous student ac tivities. 
Explanations such as "did not 
follow the proper procedures" 
come 10 mmd. Though I have 
ncver met Ms. Chadwell , she has 
created a vcry distinc t an d 
unpl easa nt impreSSIOn o f a 
quintesse ntial bureaucrat, with 
Iittlc if any regard for the students. 
Possibly, this perception of Ms. 
Chadwell is untalr. Yet surely you, 
as somewhat of a politiCian 
yourself, must reahze that realiey is 
of little Imponance - it is the 
perception which is vital , and Ms. 
Cadwell pre sents a mos t 
unpleasant perception of thiS 
uni vers it y's prioritie s and 
adminstration. I do not know If she 
wa s c hosen becau se her 
management style saves the 
university money, but I suspect 
that in the long run what she is 
costing will be exponential in a 
cash sense, and immeasurable in 
ocher ways. 

My years at UCSD have been 
filled with color, and it is not 
without some regret that I leave. 
Talking with other students, 1 find 
that my feelings are perhaps not as 
common as they should be. To my 
mind , this points to a great need 
for Sail San Diego and programs 
like it. 

I have no conception of where I 
will be in 25 years, but I do expect 
that as UCSD celebrates its 50th 
anniversary, I will receive a 
solicitation for monies to once 
again "enhan ce the lives of 
students" at my alma mater. 
Although I doubt at that time I Will 
be able to solve a slllgie differential , 
I know I will carry a vivid memory 
of a moonless night on a schooner 
at sea I hope that you can see to it 
that it is nO! diminished by a 
further memory: a very bmer sense 
of loss in realizing that my younger 
brother and his classmates never 
had the opponuniey to enjoy the 
things th at made my years at UCSD 
ri h - and a very unpleasant final 
rememberance of my administra-
tion, which seemed to care vety 
much about "proper procedures," 
and much less about Its tudents

By J,W. AKERS-SASSAMAN, 
Capitol Cone'pone/cm 

SACRAMENTO, UC Wire - A 
$700 milhon tax rebate or more 
tate services to schools and local 

governments, that IS the question . 
Unfonunately, the answer IS not 
expected to be proVided quite yet, 
even though both the sta te Senate 
and the Assembly were set to vote 
on next year's budget late 
Thursday 

The reason IS there are 
dlrf: rences between the proposed 
$40.9 billion budget approved by 
th e Assembly Ways and Means 
Committee Wednesday and the 
$41.9 billion one lauer approved 
by the Senate Budget and Fiscal 
Review Committee. 

The main ddTerences involve 
what to do with the $700 million 

The future of the 
student fee increase will 
hinge on the Senate and 
Assembly decision about 
the $700 million . 

- Kirk Knutsen, UCSA 
- part of the $2.7 billion the state 
unexpectedly collected in taxes 
this year - Gov. George 
Deukmejian says exceeds the 
voter-Imposed Gann spending 
limit. 

DeukmeJlan has said that the 
1979 constitutional amendment 
establishing the hmll requires that 
tax collections above and beyond 
the hmit must be returned to 
taxpayers. The legislature seems to 
disagree. The budget the Senate is 
considering allocates the money to 
schools and local governments. 

Although several Assembly-
members have hinted that they 
would like to spend the $700 
million for improved stare services, 
the budget the Assembly is

"May Day, May Day," the entire field of division III golfers 
shouted as Triton Pat Weishan strolled up to the tee one fine NCAA 
week in May. Whooshl With his graceful and relaxed swing and his 
intense and accurate putting, he ate up the course in Mansfield, 
Ohio and brought home the NCAA Division III national indMdual 
title, while leading the Tritons to a second place national team title. 

Pat shot rounds of 73, 69, 73, and 74 in the national toumament 
for a total score of 289, an awesome one strke over par and four 
strokes under his closest competition. 
"His athletic performance is unparalleled and his contribution to the 
team's success was vital, " said Triton coach Mike \Xfydra. 

UCSD Athletics is proud to honor Pat Weishan as May's Bud Ught 
Athlete-of-the-Month and wishes him luck as he travels to the 
Division I championships this week.
