American Professor 
Expelled From China 
After Conviction 

BEIJING - China convicted an 
American business professor today 
of spying for Taiwan and ordered 
him expelled. 

Li Shaomin, a naturalized 
American citizen, had been held 
since his arrest Feb. 25. 

New China News Agency gave 
no details of the case but reported 
that a "large amount of confirmed 
evidence" showed that Mr. Li had 
spied for Taiwan.

SALT LAKE CITY - The death

increasing calls for stronger regula-
tion of camps for troubled youths. 

At least 31 teenagers in 11 states 
have died at these camps since 
1980, including three this year. 

The deaths and reports of abus-
es are putting increased pressure on 
states to adopt regulations to gov-
ern the roughly 400 boot camps 
operating around the country.

Colorful welcome: The new Stuart Art Collection piece, "ReadlWrite/ThinkiDream, " welcomes 
Deniz Ari and Brittney Martin to Geisel Library. 

New Art to Be Introduced 
Artist John Baldessari's 'ReadIWritelThinkiDream' 
spices up the foyer of Geisel Library 
By STEVE LEHTONEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The newest addition to UCSD's Stuart Art 
Collection will be introduced at the entrance of 
Geisel Library on July 21 at 5:30 p.m. 

John Baldessari 's piece 
"ReadlWriteffhinkiDream" has transformed 
the entrance of the library into an artistic 
expression of students' quest for knowledge. 

The library facade now features eight 1 0-
foot-high glass windows, each with a large 
photo of a UCSD student standing atop 
shelved books. The students stand to the right 
and left of the sliding glass entry doors. 

The glass of the sliding doors now features 

panels of red, yellow and blue. When the doors 
are open, the door glass overlaps with adjacent 
glass to create secondary colors of orange, 
green and purple . • 

Words above the door tell students to 
"Read, Write, Think, Dream." 

Inside the library entrance, there are more 
glass panels with photos of seated students. To 
the right is a glass wall etched with images of 
palm trees. To the left is a mural of pencils and 
pens standing upright. 

The artist, John Baldessari, said his desire 
was to communicate the importance of stu-
dents to a university.

UCSD Ends 
Bergensons 
Contract 
Agreement will not be 
renewed after its expira-
tion in September 
By GEOFF DIETRICH 
Associate News Editor 

UCSO's eight-year relationship wi th 
Bergensons Property Services, a company 
that provides janitorial services for the uni-
versity, will end in September. 

The universi ty 's contract wi th 
Bergensons, which has been the focus of 
student and union campaigns to achieve 
increased pay, benefits and representation 
for janitors employed by the company. will 
not be renewed when it expires at the end of 
September. 

The agreement guarantees employment 
with UCSD's Physical Plant Services to 
Bergensons employees who worked at -E 
(,lCSD under the old contract. 

As UCSD employees, the janitors will bl' 
represented by the American Federation of 
State, County and Municipal Employees 
Local 3299. The AFSCME represents nt!ar-
Iy 2,400 employees on campus and at the 
medical centers. 

Once hired by UCSD they will be paid 
between $9 and $1 2 per hour. Also, workers 
will receive medical benefits, vacation time 
and holidays off. Additional skills training 
will also be provided by the university. 

A former Bergensons employee who was 
fired after she attempted to organize work-
ers, Alejandra Rodriguez, will be rehired as a 
result of the agreement. The National Labor 
Relations Board recently ruled in her favor 
regarding the incident. 

Bringing the jobs in-house will cost the 
university money, but the benefi ts of direct

Students take in-depth classes and experience dorm life 
By MARGARET O'NEILL 
News Editor 

For three weeks, 137 high school students in 
the Academic Connections summer program 
have occupied three residence halls in Revelle 
College. They arrived July 1 from al lover the 
country, and live, sleep, dine and study on cam-
pus. One student came from England to study. 

The Academic Copnections program is in 
its first year. The program, founded and direct-
ed by Luciano Coraua, is a combined· effort of 
the Univorsity Extension and the Office of 
Student Affairs. High school students with 
grade point averages of 3.3 br better and letters 
of recommendation from teachers may enroll. 
They choose one class to attend four hours per 
day from July 1 through July 21. 

Many UCSD graduate and undergraduate 
students are involved in the program. 

"The whole staff, with the exception of the 
site manager, is UCSD students: Corazza said. 

Graduate students teach all eight classes 
and undergraduate teaching assistants help 
with labs and workshops. 

Most of the classes ava ilable this year were 
scicn e-related. When they enrolled, students 
cho e from classes on ~ncer, cognitive science, 

com puter science, marine biology, optics, 
influenza and writing. 

"We're looking in the future to increase the 
number of humanities classes," Corazza said. 

Corazza said that about 60 percent of the 
students are female. 

"Things are changing for young women," 
Corazza said. He said that he directed a similar 
program at Johns Hopkins University that 
enrolled mostly males. 

The program provided rewards for the 
UCSD students illvolv.:d as well as for the high 
school attendt!es. 

Instructor Mark Wahrcnbrock is a graduate 
student of pathology at the UCSD School of 
Medicine. He found out about the program in an 
e-mail message from Corazza. in which he asked 
for instructors of marine biology. Wahrenbrock 
proposed to Coraz.za a class on cancer. 

"When I realized he was giving me an 
opportunity to design, propose and teach a 
course. I was really excited ," Wahrenbrock said. 

Each morning, his students enter a small 
room in York Hall full of lab equipment that 
most biology majors do not see for years. The 
class uses a very hands-on approach to under-

UC to Require Mandatory 
Health Insurance In Fall 

Beginning fall quarter 2001, the University of 
California will require as a condition of enroll-
ment that all students have a major medical 
health insurance plan, because Student Health 
Services cannot substitute for health insurance. 

If students are not covered by a comprehen-
sive health insurance plan. they will be immedi-
ately enrolled in t he Undergraduate Student 
Health Insurance Plan, whic h wi ll cost $163 a 
quarter and will be automatically assessed with 
quarter fees. 

Students with adequate health insurance may 
waive themselves of USHIP by demonstrat ing 
proof of comparable coverage. The waiver 
process will be available online this summer at 
httpi/studentlink.ucsd.edu. 

SHS will remain available on campus to serve 
students' outpatient needs free of charge. as it 
is funded by registrat ion fees. 

UCSD R~searcher Wins Michael 
J. Fox FOundation Grant 

UCSD professor of neurosc iences and pathol-
ogy El iezer Masliah received a $100,000 grant 
from the Michael J. Fox Foundation for 
Park inson's Research. 

The award, one of 15 given, is .awarded to 
researchers seek ing a cure for the neurological 
disorder that affects 1.5 million Americans. 

In 1991, Masliah's lab identified and cloned 
human alpha-synuclein, a protein centrally involved 
in Parkinson's disease. A-synuclein is a major com-
ponent of Lewy bodies, which are dense masses of 
proteins found in Parkinson's cells. 

Recently, Masliah 's lab identified a similar 
protein to a-synuclein that blocks the develop-
ment of Lewy bodies_ this naturally occurring 
protein, now called beta-synuclein, untangles 
protein masses formed by a-synuclein in test 
tubes and in studies done on mice. 
. Masliah plans to continue studies on mice . 
and develop a chemical compound siMilar to the 
naturally occurring ~synuclein. .

4 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Monday, July 16; 2001 

HOLDI 

DOMESTIC 
RHETORIC 
FROM 
BUSH 
ALIENATES 
OUR 
ALLIES 
ABROAD 

I t seems rather ironic that one of the perceived strengths of a possible Bush administration during last fall's presi-dential campaign would be a strong 
and capable fo reign policy team made up of 
veteran players such as Condoleezza Rice, 
Dick Cheney and Colin Powel l. If world opin-
ion on American fo reign policy is anything to 
go by. this adm inistration has done nothing 
short of failing miserably on the world stage. 

The reason is simple. When it comes to 
international politics. only two opinions 
about the way you exercise foreign policy 
matter in the end: the rest of the world's and 
that of your citizens. One will get you re-
elected, but appealing to the fo rmer will actu-
ally earn you the meri t abroad that will 
acheive concessions from other countries. 

The essential problem is that the Bush 
ca mp, along with its conservative advocates, is 
applyi ng domestic rhetoric in the contextual-
ly separate realm of international diplomacy. 
There has been plunging approval for Amer-
ica n policies in recent months from peoples 
abroad - even within the past week the 
administration was still needlessly antagoniz-
ing fo reign friends and foes alike with its 
absurd, domestica lly inspired pro-gun stance 
at a United Nations convention on small 
arms control. 

Perhaps the IllOSt Visible tOpiC of American 
obstinacy abroad is the ques tion of human 
righ ts. While the Bush adm inistratio n man-
aged to watch U.S. membership in the U.N. 
Human Rights Commission slip away, it has 
ye t to regain any sort of confidence in world 
opinion in recent months that it actually 
belongs on the commission. 

The Western European view on U.S. 
human rights currently goes someth ing like 

this: The federal execution of Timothy 
McVeigh last month brought not applause 
from foreign leaders, but denouncement that 
the United States would exercise such an 
inhuman punishment on its own citizens. 

The Bush administration hypocritically 
dismissed those concerns with a People's 
Republic of China-like answer: It's internal 
business - you have no right to dictate what 
we do to keep a stable society. 

Yet the Bush administration still dares to 
tell Ch ina to stop executing its criminals and 
withheld funds for Serbian reconstruction 
unt il Siobodan Milosevic was brought to trial. 
The fo rmer president of Serbia and the for-
mer governor of Texas have both stated that 
many members of their respective societies 
have no right to live, yet one sits in our White 
House in Washington and the other in a 
prison ce ll at The Hague. 

The problem with the White House's pos-
turing on this matter is that it is applying the 
rhetoric of domestic policy in a world forum . 
In the United States, the death penalty is a 
viable option for punishment, while in West-
ern Europe, the death penalty is an archaic, 
inhumane punishment. In Europeann minds, 
our arguments for the death penalty make no 
sense at all. 

The Bush administration tells the world , 
"We killed Timothy McVeigh because he was 
a horrible person and deserved to die, but 
prisoners in China do not deserve to die 
because the death penalty is in the hands of a 
questionable government ." 

Western Europe finds this argument as 
sensible as, "I shot the dog because he was 
misbehaving inside instead of outside." 
Regardless of where the dog is or what it is 
doing, there is almost no valid reason to 

shoot. 
America's stubbornness with the funda-

mental nature of our arguments is leaving our 
allies breathless - not out of admiration for 
our ideals, but at our incomprehensible 
blindness and stupidity. By taking for granted 
a world view that shares the same values as 
American conservative politics, rhe Bush 
administration is alienating our all ies and dri-
ving them into the political arms of our rapid-
ly growing list of foes, which China notably 
heads. 

A more galling example of alack of accom-
modation for other viewpoints comes fro m 
the United States' stance at last week's con-
ference on small arms control. Kofi Annan, 
the U.N. Secretary-General. maintains, 
"These arms are doing incredible damage in 
cities and war-torn areas." The United 
Nations points out that 80 percent of the 4 
million small arms deaths since 1990 arc of 
women and children. 

In spite of this fact, the ironically named 
U.S. Undersecretary for Arms Control had 
the audacity to say, "The vast majority of arms 
transfers in the world are routine and not 
problematic. Each member state of the Unit-
ed Nations has the right to manufacture and 
export arms for purposes of national 
defense." 

Why would the Bush administration rake 
such a stance when arms smuggling is a 
lucrative business used to fund violent con-
flicts around the world and kill so many peo-
ple? If there were a "humaR rights" issue that 
were black and white, this would be it - after 
all, we're talking about the lives of millions of 
people, not a few thousand political prisoners

San Diego Summer Disappoints 
Thought 
Bubble 

MARGARET O'NEILL 

I originally thought that living in San Diego for the summer would be a 
good idea. I enjoyed my life so 
much my first year of college, and 
I couldn't imagine living under my 
parents' roof for three months. 

I failed to contemplate what 
I'd actually do with my time. 
Here I am, two weeks in, and 
bored out of my skull. 

I live in Pepper Canyon, 
which was probably my first mis-
take. Had I chosen to sublet, I 
would have known my room-
mates beforehand, and possibly 
had someone to hang out with. 
Instead, I opted to risk random 
roommate assignment, and I was 
dealt the worst hand imaginable: 
I have no roommates. 

Well, I .basically have twO 
roommates, but they are so 
atta.ched at the hip (read: groin) 
that I only talk to them when 
strange things happen and I 
choose to interrupt them. The 
other person, my actual room-
mate, never moved in. 

On a side note, I think my 
apartment is haunted. Someone 
has been rearranging the refrig-
erator contents, moving the soap, 
stealing towels and opening 
doors. It isn't me, my one room-
mate, nor her boyfriend. The best 
explana~ion we've come up with 
involves the supernatural. 

Most of my friends left town 

for the summer, and those who 
didn't are working 9-to-5 jobs. 
Everyone is either too tired or 
not around to hang out with me. 

Not that I spend all my time 
sitting and sulking. So far I have 
spent about five hours total on 
my summer school class, of 
which four hours and 58 min-
utes of those were in the lecture 
hall listening to the professor 
ramble about his kidney stones. 

I have a part-time job as well, 
which is interesting in its own 
right. Have you ever really thought 
about the impact of a game of Bar-
bie Dolls on a person's psyche? 

I have a part-time job 
as well, which is 
interesting in its own 
right. Have you ever 
really thought about the 
impact of a game of 
Barbie Dolls on a 
person's psyche? 

I didn't realize until now how 
little free time I had last year. I 
don 't know what to do with 
myself without four classes to 
juggle, the Guardian to work on 
twice a week, and hundreds of 
people within yards to visit. I 
found myself actually hoping for 
homework the other day. That 
was when I knew I had hit an all-
time low. I don't know what to do 
with my free time anymore. 

Anyway, I do have ·a point here. 
I'm bored. I was upset about that 
until a couple days ago. Then I hit 
a point of introspection. A calm 

fell over me, as I realized that I did-
n't have to be constantly social 
For the first time in my life, I was 
content to lounge on my bed and 
read a book on a Friday night. 

I've since relaxed quite a bit. I 
have a whole lot of time for every-
thing I want to do. Or at least I 
will, after this damned issue of the 
Guardian gets done. 

This imminent free time has 
opened doors for me Gust like my 
apartment's ghost). Suddenly, I 
have time to read something 
besides Cal Copy readers. My 
friend, a literature major, has rec-
ommended to me the downtown 
San Diego City Library, which !'II 
have to visit. I've dug out the 
books I started but never finished. 
And I've heard that somewhere, 
buried deep inside, Geisel Ubrary 
actually has books. (So far in my 
college career, I've utilized the 
microfilm archives, the film and 
video library and the scholarly 
journals section ... woo.) 

Also, now that I have a car, 
I've discovered beaches besides 
Black's, and I don't miss that hill. 
I hope to eventually visit Mission 
Beach, Pacific Beach (hey, did 
you know there's a beach, not 
just a bunch of skeezy shops?) 
and, like, all the other ones. 

Much to my friends' glee, I've 
discovered trance music. I enter-
tain myseff with Web sites and 
new songs. It's a substantial devi-
ation from my normal rock/hard 
rock musical choices, but the 
beats strike my fancy, and down-
loading is yet another thing to fill 
my summer nights.

Editor: 

Last April, UCSD hosted a 
series of events related to the life 
and career of uniot:! organizer 
Cesar Chavez. These events 
marked the first time in the history 
of UCSD that a campus adminis-
tration chose to highlight the his-
tories of Chicano/a and Mexican 
communities and their ongoing 

struggle for equal rights. 
The figure of Chavez was an 

especially important choice, given 
his lifetime of sacrifices so that 
workers could have fai r wages, bet-
ter working conditions, and 
respect. Now there is even talk of 
naming the new Sixth College after 
Chavez or some other prominent 
Latino/a. 

Faced with the absolutely legit -
imate effort by campus janitors to 
unionize and receive a living wage, 
the administration stonewalled and 
resorted to intimidation and firings. 

Given the publicity blitz around 
the Chavez events and the universi-
ty's attempt to put on a human 
face, it is a tragic irony that some-
one in the UCSD administration 
chose to call in the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service in an 
attempt to destroy the union drive 
and disperse its leadership. 

This is one of the oldest tactics 
used by reactionary and anti-work-
er forces against Chicano/a and 
Mexican workers, dating back to at 
least the 1930s. With this single act. 
the corporate mentality, ant i-
democratic ethos, and anti-Lati-
no/a bias of UCSD's leadersh ip 
became apparent to the entire Chi-
cano/a and Latino/a communi ty. 

Empty acts of symbolism are 
cheap. The admin istrati on's 
attempt to reap public relations 
benefits from the Chavez events 
has now been exposed as little 
more than cynicism. Were he still 
alive, Chavez would be the first to 
denounce this unwarranted and 
reprehensible action.

Globalization Brings Lower Quality of Life 
Demonstrations in Genoa, Italy, and Seattle aim to preserve the essential pillars of democracy 
By SIMONE SANTINI 
Senior 51 aff Writer 

In It:ss than a month, the ch iefs 
of govcrnmmt of the seven most 
industrialized countries in thc 
world ,liang wi th Russia's Vladimir 
Putln - the so-called G8 group -
will Illeet in Genoa. Italy, to talk 
.Ibout tile StdtC dnd future dirt:ction 
of the international economy. 

At thl' same time, a number of 
anllglobalization orga nizations 
have announced massive anti-G8 
demonstrations. The Italian police 
expect that around a million people 
will show up. 

The Genoa demonstration will 
be a good occasion to evaluate the 
evolvlllg agmda and the political 
srn:ngth of the movement that the 
European press has already bap-
tized the "Seattle people," after the 
dcmonstrations at the World Trade 
Organization meeting in Seattle 
two years ago. 

The Seattle movement is, by its 
own admission, a loose connection 
of parts with widely different orien-
tations, but a few general trends are 
starting to emerge. 

First of all, one should under-
stand what is meant by globalization, 

si nce the term has several connota-
tions with different economic, polit-
ical and ethical implications. 

On one hand, there is what one 
might ca ll the "globaliza tion of 
awareness." More and more people 
are becoming aware of the existence 
oi other cultures, of their habits and 
differences. This form of globa liza-
tion is a positive cultural fo rce, even 
in light of some embarrassing out-
comes, like the naive syncretism of 
most New Age philosophy. 

The "global vi llage," to rely on an 
overused and profoundly misunder-
stood expression, entails at least that 
the villagers know each other. 

ll1e corruption of cultures by the 
action of other cultures is also 
unavoidable and, to some extent, 
desirable. Cultures can only grow in 
symbiosis with other cultures, and 
without such contamination, works 
such as Spain's Alhambra Palace 
would not exist, and the majority of 
humanity would have never known 
the number zero and the principles 
of democracy, to name but a few. 

The Seattle movement, or at 
least its most intelligent portion, is 
not against any of t! .~se things. 

There is, to be honest, a nco-
Luddite fringe component in the 

aJltiglobalization movement, but 
the movement as a whole knows 
very well that any such position is 
self-defeating. So much , in fact, 
that antiglobalization activists 
make great use of certain new tech-
nologies, such as the Internet and 

Crucial decisions about 
our lives are no longer 
made by governments of 
international organisms 
accountable to voters, but 
by boards of directors 
accountable only to 
shareholders, 
cellular phones. 

So, what is the essence of the 
antiglobalization message of the 
Seattle movement? My interpreta-
tion (personal but, I venture, well -
founded) is that it is the opposition 
to the modalities in which globaliza-
tion is imposed on us, in particular 
to the corporate control of it, and of 
the consequent primacy of economy 
over other areas of human life. 

We 're not going to try to impress you with numbers ... 

The forces against which these 
groups are revolting are the arro-
gant globalization efforts of multi-
national corporations, and the 
reduction of all human values to 
the search for profit. Is the global-
ization of Nike, which paid endors-
er Michael Jordan a salary equiva-
lent to that of 22,000 of its Asian 
workers, not the global cultural 
horizon by which we know and 
care about the plight of the Asian 
workers? 

It is a protest against the 
rhythms and values that corporate 
globalization is imposing. 

The global economy is forcing us 
- even we who live in rich countries 
- to work longer hours and have 
less and less of a personal and social 
life. To guarantee an average income, 
last year American families had to 
work the equivalent of seven weeks 
more than they did in 1990. 

The global economy is also 
convincing us of the unavoidability 
of this model, and of the need to 
sacrifice everything to the supreme 
good of the economy: Only 8 per-
cent of Americans would accept 
working fewer hours for less pay.

Corporate globalization is also 

forcing us to look and think the 
same but, at the same time, to be 
more alone. 

Our jobs look the same wherever 
we are, and our free tiine looks the 
same too: The entertainment indus-
try is also global , and is pushing us 
toward uniform models of behavior 
that invariably involve being more 
and more alone and surrounded by 
expensive gadgets. Inva luable social 
skills are lost in the process. 

The protest of the Seattle move-
ment is a protest against the trivial-
ization of politics. Crucial decisions 
about our lives are no longer made 
by governments of international 
organisms accountable to voters, 
but by boards of directors account-
able only to shareholders. 

In the process, an important pil-
lar of all democracies is lost: the 
principle that every individual has 
the same political power (that is, 
one vote). This principle is being 
replaced by the principle of con-
centration of wealth : Political 
power is directly proportional to 
the amount of stock owned.

rotting in Chinese jails. 

Perha ps Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga ., who 
warned that the conference should not try to 
"dictate domestic policy," can point out to us 
why conservatives would not support such 
measures. 

At the core of a worldwide implementa-
tion of domestic gun-happy rhetoric are the 
same forces behind the National Rifle Asso-
ciation, of which Barr is a member. That 
organization fears "international meddling" 
in the domestic affairs of the United States -
precisely be ause the United States dictates 
human rights va lues, along with environ-
mental values, as evidenced by the. Bush 
administration's rejection of the Kyoto pro-
lOcol.

White House say there are fundamental 
principles and values that cannot be ignored 
or bent in international politics, that makes

Continued from ,.,. 8 

All other human-values have to bow to 
the supremacy of wealth and consumption; 
those who do not own stock and do not con-
sume are nonentities. 

The global economy is convincing us to 
accept a society 111 which a few hundred peo-
ple control half the wealth of the planet, 
while one-third of the population lives on 
less than d dollar per day. 

In essence, the message of the Seatt le 
movement IS more ethical than e onomie. Its 

versal truths are the only things that dictate 
behavior, there is no room for accommoda-
tion - invariably, criticism about the foreign 
policy judgments of the Bush administration 
is misguided, and the conservative rhetoric 
tha t appeals to U.S. Republicans holds the 
values the entire world should hold. 

What this amounts to is a new brand of 
moral imperialism powered by a hegemony 
controlling global economic resources. What 
is scary, however, is that invariably hard-line, 
unaccommodating decisions in international 
politics only diminish a country's influence 
and economic control in other countries, as 
alienated leaders seek more amicable mar-
kets (take a look at Moscow). 

When a country loses economic influ-
ence, the only other way to dictate its morals 
to the world is through big guns. 

Why are we spending so much on a mis-
sile defense system, disobeying an arms con-
trol treaty and beefing up our incredibly 
strong military even more? In reality, are we 
going to have to invade North Korea or Libya 
to stop ei ther from invading our shores? 

If the Bush administration thinks that by 
reinforcing America's global military power, 
European and Asian leaders will again put up 
with American rhetoric and unilateral deci-
sions as they did during the Cold War, it is 
sorely mistaken. Last time, those countries 
had to run to us for defense from the Soviets 
- this time, there's only one bully left who 
thinks he's always right on the world stage. 

protests go deeper than simple issues of eco-
nomic strategy, to question the ethical bases of 
the global economy. It reminds us that econo-
my - be it global or not - is just an instru-
ment whose foundations must be ethical. 

Maybe the essence of a fair and rational 
opposition to this brand of globalization is bet-
ter summarized by the words that the Ameri-
can economist Jeremy Rifkin used to address 
his Italian audience at a recent pre-G8 debate: 

"You Italians have been the first to devel-
op the concept of commerce and were able 
to se ll your cul ture in the international 
arena: furniture, silk, glass. Centuries of suc-
cess, and your cul ture has never been stran-
gled by commerce. The main reason is that 
no Italian ever belIeved that the market was 
more important than culture."

UCSD Pediatric Merges with Children's H~spital . 
Long-awaited move is aimed to improve the quality of healthcare for the children of San Diego 
By JEFFREY WHITE 
Senior Staff Writer 

After years of discussion, UCSD 
and the Children's Hospital of San 
Diego agreed to consolidate their 
pediatric programs to provide a 
complete health system for San 
0, 'go's children . 

Agreements were signed in a 
ceremony june 21 and transition of 
UCSD's inpatient programs to 
Children's Hospital are set to begin 
Aug. 1. 

The program consolidation will 
combine the clinical , teaching, 
research and comm unity service 
effortS of the UCSD School of 
Medici ne's pediatrics department 
and those of the region's only health 
care institution devoted to children . 

Kenneth Lee jones, professor of 
pediatrics and interim chair of 
pediatrics at UCSD, will become 
physician in chief of Children's 
Hospital of San Diego. 

jones said the consolidation 
will give residents more experi-
ence with patients, most of whom 
are at Chi ldren's Hospital, which 
is licensed for 226 inpatients 
compared to UCSD's usual popu-
lation of 15 to 20 pediatric inpa -
tients. 

"This will really improve the 
quality of care because the consol-
idated programs will make it so that 
staff, faculty and residents will be 
where the patients are," jones said. 

jones said he believes the com-
bined program will allow more spe-
cialists to be hired . 

"When operating two services 
separately, you look for all-around 
utility players," he said. "By consoli-
dating, we will have the luxury of

Oceanography and is teachi ng the

"Down at S.cripps, there 's not 
ve ry much opportunity to teach," 
he said. "It's a great experience 
and I wish there were possibili ties 
for more grad students to get 
involved teaching kids this age." 

His class, which consists of two 
hours of lecture in the morning 
and two hours of lab in the after-
noon, is also primarily female stu-
dents. It included an early-morn-
ing trip to the tide pools. 

Craig said he has found the 
experience rewarding.

"Enron has always been a

ment. 

Enron halted direc t energy ser-
vice to UC and CSU systems on 
Feb. 1, violating the original four-
year contract. In response, the uni-
versities fil ed a lawsuit against 
Enron. The energy company filed 
an appeal against the lawsuit a few 
days later. 

Wh ile the lawsuit and appeals 
were 'ptnding, the UniVersl l1 eS 
were forced to receive electrici ty

Students in Craig's class gave it 
rave reviews. 

Michelle, a student from Los 
Gatos, Calif., likes the dedication 
of her classmates. 

"Everyone in the class came 
basically for the class: she said. 
"The tide pooling wasn't planned 
but everyone decided to get up

But Enron spokesperson Peggy 
Mahoney said in May that Enron's 
action in February still honored its 
contract with the universities. 

Attorn eys and business offi-
cials fo r the universities and 
Enron decided to try to eule ou t 
of court. Swisher said. 

Although the universities were 
forced to buy their power from 
struggling state utilities, they were 
paying the same prices under the 
Enron contract. 

Enron 's decision to stop direct 
energy service forced California 
taxpayers to foot the rest of the 
univers iti es' bills. McFadden 
said.

Dr. Edward W. Holmes, vice 

chancellor of health sciences and

patients will not have to change 
their health care providers. 

Holmes also stated that some 
pediatric services will continue to 
be offered through UCSD's med-

Primary care and adolescent ' 
services will still be offered at the

Collection, I noticed that none of 
them dealt with students," 
Baldessari said. "Having taught all 
my life, it seemed to me that stu-
dents should be prioritized. A uni-
versity shouldn't be for professors. 
Professors should be for sllldents." 

Baldessari said the featured stu-
dents standing atop the library 
books are a symbolic representa-
tion of intellectual success. 

"I wanted there to be a victory 
over the reading material." he 
explained. 

Director of the Stuart Art 
Project Mal)' Livingstone Beebe 
said she was thrilled with the pro-
ject and the work of Baldessari. 

"We are honored to have a pro-
ject by John Baldessari and excited 
about the way the project trans-
forms the space," Beebe said. "It's an 
experience to walk through there." 

Lynda Claassen , director of 
Mandeville Special Collections, 
further praised the piece. 

"[t certainly makes the front of 
the library a significant art work," 
she said. "I think it looks terrific." 

Students, on the other hand, 
have diverging views on th~ work. 

Meghan Rao, a third-year stu-
dent at Marshall college, expressed 

Jones expects the move to 
increase interaction among the 
best pediatric minds in the region. 

"This will improve communica-
tion: he said. "We'll be able to 
interact with one another more 
freely about general knowledge and 
about specific patients." 

UCSD Chancellor Robert C. 
Dynes said he is optimistic about 
the potential of the unified pedi-
atrics programs. 

"By pooling our talent and 
resources, and consolidating our 
patient care, education' and 
research activities in a facility 
designed especially for children, we 
will be able to set new standards of 
pediatric excellence not only for 
San Diego, but for the nation: 
Dynes stated. 

her views with equivocation. 
"I believe the work is supposed 

to represent the different types of 
students at UCSD," Rao said. "[ 
don't think the colors really blend 
with the rest of the facade." 

Conor Medley, a fifth-year stu-
dent at Revelle college, disliked the 
piece. uThe library is a place that 
really doesn't warrant having art on 
it. They don 't really look bad but 
they don't appeal to me: Medley 
said. 

The Stuart Collection was 
founded in 1981 and is dedicated 
to funding experimental public 
sculptures. The project consists of 
1S pieces on the UCSD campus. 

Baldessari grew up in San Diego 
and has been a teacher for more

KemlCk Le~/ GuardIan ( ! 

----------- -----------------------------------------------

Gradudtc and professional school present testing hurdles 
even higher than those the SAT presen ted high school Stu-
dents. Curricula vary among colleges and universities. so 
admiSSion officers look at graduate examination scores as 
another way of choosll1g possible ca ndidates for their 
school>. 

ThiS creates a great need for tutoring and test preparation 
to boost test scores. The test preparation market is growing 
and diversifying. reflecting the demand of college students 
with different levels of tutoring. 

Though tests are crucial to the adm issio ns process. other 
qualifications. such as undergraduate GPA. course load and 
extracurricular activi ties are ta ken into account. 
Nevertheless. what makes testing so va luable is the level 
pl aYll1g field and co mmon measure it creates for all appli-
cants 

Rather than having one exam that is taken by all Stu-
dents. graduate schools requi re dlfferellt tes ts depending on 
what potential students wish to study. Each test IS separate 
from the others and has different time lengths and ques-

tlon~ -
Some tests require uSll1g computers. while others still 

require a '0. 2 pencil. With all the tests around. here is a 
look II1tO the major tests available and how to best prepare 
for a graduate admission e t 

Graduate Record Exam (GRE) 
Three sections: verbal (30 minutes. 30 questions). qualita-

tive (45 mi nutes. 28 questions). analytica l (60 minutes. 35 
questions). 

Scoring: Each section is scored from 200 to 800. 
Average: 470 (verbal). 570 (quantitative). 540 (al)alytical) . 
Almost all masters and doctoral programs require the 

GRE. therefore it is not necessarily related to any particular 
field of study. Financial aid and grants are also determined 
using GRE scores. 

The verbal section measures ability to comprehend and 
analyze written materials. The qualitative section determines 
elementary mathematical concepts, and the analytical section 
looks at re lationships among sets of information and it tests 
logical thinking. 

The GRE is a computer adaptive test. wh ich means that 
instead of filling in the bubbles. a computer scores questions. 
This is important as computer adaptive tests force the test 
taker to answer questions according to what he has already 
answered. If a question is answered correctly. the next ques-
tion gets more difficul t. The opposite occurs when an answer 
is incorrect. 

In addition to the GRE, subject tests and a writing assess-
ment are also available. Each school has di fferent require-

ments for which tesrs its applicants must take. 

Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) 
Two sections and two essays: analytical writing assess-

ment (60 minutes, two essays). verbal (75 minutes. 41 ques-
tions), quantitative (75 minutes. 37 questions) . 

Sections have subscore ranges of 0 to 60. Writing assess-
ment ranges from 0 to 6. 

Average: 500 
Business school candidates must take the GMAT, which 

tests general academic ability, but not business knowledge. A 
great score won't necessarily get you into the school of your 
choice. but a low score could keep you out. 

Note that the GMAT is a computer adaptive test. making 
it easy to take the test anytime and anywhere. 

Law School Admission Test (LSAT) 
Five sections and one essay: two logical reasoning (35 

minutes. 24-26 questions each). logic games (35 minutes. 23-
24 questions). reading comprehension (35 minutes, 26-28 
questions), experimental (35 minutes. 24-28 questions), writ-
ing sample (30 minutes). 

Scoring: Overall scores range from 120 to 180.

Continued from page 10

The LSAT is di ffe rent than othcr tests 

beca use it does not test verbal and mathe-
matical ability, instead testing logical and 
analytical thinking. LSAT questions empha-

Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) 
Three sections and two essays: verbal rea-

soning (85 minutes. 65 questions) . physical 
sciences (100 minutes. 77 questions). writing 
sample (60 minutes. twO essays) . biological 
sciences (100 minutes. 77 questions) . 

Scoring: Scores from each section range 
from 1 to 15 and writing sample scores range 
from "J" to "T," with "T" being the highest. 
- Average: 8 for each section; writing sam-
ple average is "N." 

Medical schools require this rigorous and 
intensive test that often lasts longer than six 
hours with breaks. The MCAT tests critical 
and verbal skills as well as numerous scien-
tific concepts. 

While the LSAT does not generally fol -
low formulas, the MCAT is heavy in mem-
orization. requiring a basic knowledge of 
general and organic chemistry. physics and 
biology. 

Test preparation courses 
One of the most common and effective 

ways students prepare for their admission 
examinations is to take a test preparation 
course such as those offered by Princeton 
Review and Kaplan. 

These companies' classes cover the basics 
of each test and proctor mock exams. Many 
students tind the courses helpful because 
th ey organize key concepts and provide 
review sessions for all materials covered. 

Most courses consist ' of several classes 
that go over the various sections and essay 
portions of the test. 

Students learn how to approach individ-
ual questions as well as overall test-taking 
techniques. To reinforce these ideas. mock 
exams are given under regular test-taking 
conditions. 

For applicants who need more structured 
test preparation. well-scheduled courses 
offer a systematic timeline. Many students 
consider these classes essential to boosting 
their scores. 

These classes are also convenient and 
flexible, as many companies provide a mult i-
tude of possible time slots. Course lengths 
vary by the type of test taken. bu t IllOSt last 
about 10 weeks. 

Coursl!s cost frolll $500 for quick reviews 
to more than $4.000 for personal ized. priva te 
sessions. The average fee fo r a regular course 
hovers around $1 .000. 

Critics of admissions tests often argue 
that these tests allow only those who can 
afford prep classes to achieve high scores. 
leaving those who cannot afford expensive 
tutoring behind. The Career Services Center 
recommends doing research to find the best 
course offered and warns against choosing 
the first course available. 

Reading your way to the top 
If the idea of spending 10 weeks or at least 

$1.000 for preparation sounds too intense or 
extreme, another option is to self-learn 
through the numerous graduate test prepa-
ration books that are available. Many of the 
companies that provide courses also sell 
books that closely represent what is taught 
by instructors. 

Besides Kaplan and the Princeton 
Review. other companies sllch as Peterson. 
Arco. and Barron 's offer guides for virtually 
every test out there. Although an instructor 
is not there to discuss problems. the conve-
nience and flexibility of reading a book help 
in preparation for the admissions tests. 

However, be wary of using books to sllldy 
for computer adapted tests. Reading a book 
can never recreate the feeling of taking a test 
by computer. 

There are many books and many ways of 
approaching the tests. but the best one is the 
one you are most comfortable using. 

When looking for books to use. make 
sure sample exams are included. These sam-
ple exams replace the mock exams used in 
preparation courses.

After transferring to Sa n

she met d man who was sweeping

of IllS lifc. She didn't think twice 
about putting school on hia tus, 
or about disappearing in Europe 
with somcollt: she had known for 
only a month or so. 

She was one of my most carc-

knew sht' would happily h,lIld

hdd no idea what to expect from 
her. 

I admit that perhaps that IS 
wha t I always relied on her fo r -
a fast-p ,lccd , impulSIve lifes tyle 
of whIch I was a part only 
bec,llIse I was a part of ha. It was 
always a win-Win situa tion - I 
remained sa feIv guarded from 
thl' consequenccs of such a 
Irfestyk by surviving sokly on 

She was one of the best 
storytellers I had been 
lucky enough to listen to, 
for one key reason: Her 
spar!<- and flair were 
genume, 

the meat of her stories, rather 
than cnjoying the fru it of such 
adven tu res firsthand . Cal l me 
bland, but I decided to move 
meticulously after sufferi ng 
through a few bad choices of my 
own. 

When I met her du ring my 
freshman year of high school. I 
was an aw.kward and shy 14-year-
old with 1Il0re lust for the non-
conformist, pulp fiction life she 
led than my timid nature would 
ever allow me to embody. She was 
one of the best storytellers I had 
been lucky enough to listen to, for 
one key reason: Her spark and 
flair were genui ne. 

Evt:ryt hing from th e attempt-
ed overdose at 13 to the semi-
nude photos she posed for at 16 

were doculnt:ntable events that 
she nev~r admitted to thinking 
twice about, but which she 
Idughed about on many occa-
sions. 

Enthralling me from the start 
with such stories, I faithfully lis-
tened to my friend throughout 
high school. I listened to the 
de tails of an inexplicable divorct: 
that sht: refused to let scar her, I 
listmed to the makings and 
breakings of several !lings with 
the boys who drove too fast and 
did too many drugs and invariably 
failed to keep my friend entn-

I listened to her laugh at her 
mother's reaction to her tattoo 
and piercings, and I listened 
pai nstakingly when her jaw was 
wired shut after her dentist rec-
ommended that she have her jaw 
broken and realigned. I listened to 
her scoff at those who bad-
mouthed her for getting her nose 
"realigned" while she was already 
under the knife for the jaw proce-
dure. I listened to her dreams and 
goars of being an erotic dancer, a 
child therapist, a photographer, 
and a counterculture-loving San 
Franciscan. 

Meanwhile, I was going to

loan Acceptance Rising 
With Upped Enrollment 
Students at Cal State University at Long 
Beach relying on college financier loans 
By ~NDRES CARDENAS 
Special to the Guardian 

LO G BEACH, Calif. - With 
more students enrolling in univer-
sities, more students are turning to 
student loans to help pay for col-
lege. 

"There has been a definite surge 
in terms of the people who are 
going to school." said Molly 
Sullivan. a spokesperson for col-
lege fi nancier Sallie Mae. "That of 
course increases the number of 
people taking out loans for educa-
tion." 

In 1970 there were an estimated 
8.6 million students enrolled at the 
university level. Today there are 
16.7 million students, an increase 
of 94 percent. Outstanding debt on 
college loans in 1999 totaled $178 
billion, Sullivan said. 

The average amount owed on 
Stafford Loans, according to the 
U.S. Department of Education, in 
1995-1996 for undergraduates 
completing their educations at 
public universities was $11,950. At 
a private university that amount 
rises to $14,290. For those who 
continue on to get a master's 
degree, those numbers jump to 
$15,000 for a public college and 
$21 ,410 at a private college. 

Recen tly, Ca lifornia State 
University at Long Beach students 
borrowed an average of $6,200 by 
the time they graduated in the 
2000-01 academic year, according 
to Financial Aid Director Dean 
Kulju. 

Students at CSULB could qual-
ify for up to three types of loans to 

pay for their college education 
dependi ng on their need : the 
Stafford Loa n, a work-study loan 
and the Perkins Loan . 

The Stafford Loan can be dis-
bursed to any student wanti ng 
assistance for college. 

"Basically it is a federally spon-
sored loan program whcr~ there 
are rwo categories, subsidized and 
unsubsidized: Kulju said. 
"Subsidized meaning whi le the stu-
dent is in school. the interest is 
paid on their behalf by the govern-
ment, that is if the studen t has 
financial need." 

The government will continue 
to pay for the interest for a six-
month grace period after the stu-
dent either graduates or withdraws 
from school. 

"The unsubsidized loan is for a 
student that does not have the 
financial need," Kulju said. "While 
the student is in school they are 
responsible for the interest." 

Under the Stafford Loan , an 
undergraduate student can borrow 
up to $46,000 for school, but can 
only have $23,000 subsidized, 
Kulju said. 

Work-study loans are also allo-
cated to CSULB, Kulju said. The $1 
million amount given to CSULB is 
only enough to where 600 students 
participate in the loan program due 
to their , financial need . Students 
will work to payoff thei r loans 
while in school. 

A Perkins Loan is also allocated 
to CSULB, and a maximum of 
$1,500 can be given to students

Summer Camp Counselor 
Job Taxing but Rewarding 
Season working with kids and horses 
offers lessons on hard work and low pay 
By CLAIRE VANNETTE 
Senior Staff Writer 

I've worked a lot of summer 
jobs, beginning with a filing stint at 
a high-tech office when I was 15 . 
Although I welcomed my pay-
checks, I loathed being shut inside 
an air-conditioned, professionally 
decorated meeting room with only 
stacks of musty paper to distract 
me from the San Diego sun . 

I opted for a change when I was 
16: retail. This job stationed me at 
a UTC kiosk alone fo r seven hours 
at a stretch. I certainly got my fill of 
the San Diego sun - I think I was 
perpetually sunburnt for the three 
months I put up with the stinking 
job. That summer, I grew to hate 
the mall and all it stood for: whin-
ing brats, pushy parents and com-
mercialized , useless goods shoved 
down the throats of sheep- like 
consumers. 

o wonder then that I returned 
to office slavery the next june and 
suffered again the hellish com-
mure, insulting supervi sion and 
repetitive tasks. Last summer, with 
tuition looming, I worked a combi-
nation of my dreaded occupations, 
pushing paper by day and hawking 
overpriced stationery by night. I 
averaged 70 hours per week in 
july. By September I was exhausted 
and by june I knew I couldn't si t 
behind a desk or stand behind a 
counter for one more minutt. 

About then , my best friend told 
lI1e that she was in terviewing for ,I 
ca mp cou nselor pOSItion. My 
Interest was piqued. I Clwlsloned 
myself on a grassy knoll , perhaps 

under a spreading oak tree in dap-
pled summer sunlight, with a 
group of sweet-eyed yo ungsters 
around me eagerly devouring my 
lesson on poetry form s and short 
story techniques. 

As I posted my resume on some 
ca mp cou nselor job placement 
Web sites, I was already quantifying 
the il'l)pact I'd have on the lives of 
impressionable, guidance-hungry 
children . What challenges I'd 
face! What maturity I'd gain! What 
a stirring, rewarding way to spend a 
summer! 

I ended up taking a position at a 
Southern California horse-riding 
camp, far enough from home to 
feel like I was embarki ng on an 
adventure, but c10sc enough to 
dash down to San Diego to take 
care of business when necessary. 

It didn 't matter that I had little 
horse experience per sc; I would 
teach electives like singing and 
drama, and I'd head up our weekly 
camper- produced newspaper. Of 
course, I wasn 't picky about what I 
would teach . All I wanted was to 
spend my summer outdoors, work-
ing with ch ildren and Jnimals and 
other students like me. 

Sure, the work would b~ hard, I 
told myself naively, and the pay 
wou ld be low compared to, well. 
anything, because minllllum wage 
laws don't apply to camp coun-
selors. I reported to trall1ing week 
with high spirits and d b,lCkpack 
full of books - trainIng w~,'k, you 
sec, was also fin.tls we~k. and I

Camp: 
Time with young campers 
proved to be invaluable 
Continued from page 13 
that I wouldn't crash my car as I 
taped lecture notes 10 my steering 
wheel and slLldied my way down 
the highway. 

The directors of the camp 
taught us everyth ing we would 

n~ed to know for our 10 life-
al tertng weeks of summer 
camp. Horse-illi terate people 
such as myself were given basic 
riding instruction and taught 
how to care for the horses on th e 
ranch . We had seminars on "risk 
management," - "risk" me31l1n g 
"lawsui ts from parents of Injured 
ch ildren" - and emergency pre-
paredness. We discussed how to 
handle homeslckncss, bed wetting 
and othe r "problem camper" 
concerns. I was primed on that 
first Sunday, ready 10 tackle the 
job, sure that I was up to han-
dling whatever ca me down the 
path . 

OK, so I wasn 't so sure. In fact , I 
was terri tied. Here I was, 19 years 
old, without younger siblings or 
much baby-sitting experience to • 
have prepared me for assuming 
responsibility for mlllors. What was 
I th inking, stepping in "loco paren-
tis" and taking the challenge of 
improving campers' lives? 

I knew the camp once was a 
Chnstian camp and while many of 
the campers were strongly reli-
gious, I am not. I am comfortable 
with the basics of Christian theol-
ogy - thanks. MMW - but I was 
hardly the person to consult dur-

empty-handed? 
Trials came at me fast and furi-

ous from the start. I mediated a 
dispute between two bickering 
siblings, and while neither party 
was entirely satisfied with the out-
come, a moderate success was 
achieved. I was surprised to find 
that teellilge girls are incapable of 
keeping their belongings clean, 
even if punishment is threatened 
and enforced. 

I faced rumors that the staff 
members that remained from the 
(amp's Christian days were trying 
passionately to convert the hea-
thens like me. Several of my girls 
were appalled when they found 
out I wasn't Christian , and were

likewise upset when I interrupted 
their religious discussion - at 
10:30 at night, long after all the 
other girls were asleep - and 
made them go to bed. 

And while the sex issue has 
been largely null so far, my girls 
have run the gamut from ignorant 
about "that reproductive thing" to 
very knowledgeable in the ways of 
the world. I have had to monitor 
their conversations closely, and 
artfully change the subject when

makers and attitude-
coppers. When the summer 
began, I was nervous about my 
lack of experience with children 
- how does a 10-year-old act, 
anyway? I have since learned that 
they are just people, slightly small-
er and less formed than adults. 

As the other counselors and I 
embarked on our first week of 
camp, one of the camp directors 
told us to touch one life each 
week - that should be our goal 
throughout the summer. 

Have I met that goal? I don't 
know. 

At the end of this week, I col-
lected evaluations from my girls; 
two of them said their least 
favorite thing was "evil coun-
selors" - could I count myself 
among them? That very same day, 
! overheard two of the younger 
girls who had attended my news-
paper class mention JIly 
name. "Claire?" one of them 
said. "She's the best!" I tried not to 
grin stupidly, and failed . My life is 
being touched, too. 

I have six weeks left of camp. 
Some days, ! can't imagine putting 
up with one more dirty cabin, one 
more mouthy camper, or one 
more rumor spreading through 
the staff. All I want to do is pack 
my things and move into the 
Hillcrest house that waits for me 
when I return to San Diego in 
September. Other days, when the 
weather is tine and the ponies are 
calm and the children are cooper-
ative and bright and unique, I 
imagine quitting school and stay-
ing here forever. 

Yes, I shovel horse poop and 
tell 7 -year-olds not to run to the

Loans: 
In 1992, student loan 
limits were raised 
Continued from .,... 12 
who qualify per academic year. 

"The Perkins Loan is a good 
program because it is a fixed inter-
est rate whereas the Stafford Loan 
is a variable rate; Kulju said. 

The Perkins Loan rate is fIXed at 
5 percent and students are given a 
nine-month grace period to begin 
repaying the loans. 

Kulju said that the loan could 
also be deferred or canceled if yol,l 
become a police officer or teacher, 
for example. This loan is also being 
done through the campus instead of 
a bank, as with the Stafford Loan. 

With an increase in the amount 
of·loans given to students, the U.S. 
Department of Education last tear 
released a report called "Debt 
Burden Four Years After College" 
on the burden student loans had 
on bachelor's degree recipients 
from 1992-1993, and how the 
loans are affecting them four years 
later. 

The study found that half .of 
those· who received bachelor's 
degrees 111 1992-93 borrowed 
money to help pay for school, 
owing an average of $10,142. Of 
those that moved on to graduate 
education, 28 percent continued to 
receive loans for school. 

Undergraduates who did not 
further their education owed an 
average of $7,100, left paying an 
average of $151 per month. Those 
who continued on to earn a master's 
degree owed $17,200, paying an 
average of $246 per month. Only 16 
percent of all borrowers from 1992-
1993 were able to payoff or have 
their loans forgiven by 1997. 

In 1992 the Reauthorization of 
Higher Education Act raised the 
loan limits. This group of students 
being studied would not benefit 

from the changes in the borrowing 
laws. The IOtal amount of money 
borrowed that year was $1 7.2 bil-
lion. That amount would increase 
38 percent 10 $23.8 billion a year 
later. 

When students either graduate 
or withdraw from college, they can 
choose many types of options to 
repay their lo.ans. 

"One of the common Iplans! 
would be over a 20-year span and 
they would divide the payments up 
over that span; said Joshua Henry, 
information specialist for the 
Federal Student Aid Information 
Center 

At Sallie Mae, the average time 
of repayment is lower. "The typical 
Irepaymentl term is done in 10 
years," Sullivan said. "But we have 
various repayment opttons 
depending on what is in the best 
interest for each borrower." 

Henry said that there is also a 
different 'type of plan called an 
Income Contingent Repayment 
Plan. 

"That is where you send in 
some sort of documentation as to 
how much you make and your 
repayment will be based on that, 
instead of putting all the pay-
ments in a certain time period," 
she said . "After 30 years, if you 
still owe money on that student 
loan, because of regulation of the 
government, you don't have to 
pay anymore on it." 

Students can also consolidate 
their loans to simplify their loan 
repayments. The interest rate will 
never exceed 8.25 percent by law. 
Loans can be consolidated during 
the grace period, once a student 
enters repayment or during defer-
ment or forbearance periods. A 
lender cannot refuse to consoli-
date a loan due to the number or 
types of loans, the school attend-
ed, the interest rate borrowers 
would be charged, or the different 
types of repayment schedules 
available to them .

can you take the class again for

THINKING OF MOVING OFF-CAMPUS? 
HERE'S SOME WHO DID IT ... 

"We called TOBIN from 
Sacramento ... 
He took time to listen to 
what we wanted for our 
daughter ... He kn.ew the 
real estate market around 
UCSD ... He selected nice 
properties with our 
daughter'S safety in 
mind ... We bought a 
property and we are very 
pleased with his services 
and professionalism ... 

We highly recommend Tobin ... Give him a call ... He will be 
there for you!" 

Mat and Carol Evans 

"Hello, .my name is Brandon 
Foster, a 2nd year student at 
Warren, I realized I needed to 
start hunting around for a place 
to live, so I gave TOBIN a call. In 
short, Tobin hooked me up! After 
I had found a place that I liked, 
he fought off other bidders until 
the place was ours. Tobin helped 
me every step of the way. He came to my apartment and 
took the forms and delivered them to the appropriate 
places for me. So now I have this property, but I won 't 
even need it until next year-not a-problem! Tobin 
found renters immediately. The condo will be paying for 
itself untill am ready to move in. He is simply the best! "

UCSD soccer star named CCAA player of 
the year for the 2000-2001 season 
By JOSH CROUSE 
Sports Editor 

One more remarkable chapter was 
added last month to the storybook career 
of UCS 0 soccer-standout Cindy Dostalek. 

She was named 2000-2001 California 
Collegiate Athletic Association Female 
Athlete of the Year. 

Dostalek, a 5-4 forward from Sierra 
Madre, Calif. , dominated in the Tritons' 
first year of Division 11 play, leading her 
team to a 21-2 record and her third 
national title in four years. 

Undeniably the leader of the team, 
Dostalek was second on the team with 12 
goals. One of those goals was the game-
winning goal with 15 seconds left in the 
national championship game against 
Northern Kentucky. She was also second 
in assists with nine, and second on the 
team with 33 points. 

She finished her career as a Triton with 
32 goals, which is eighth all-time at UCSD. 
Twenty-nine assists tie her for fourth in 
UCSD history, and 93 points place her

The UCSD women's volley-
ball team, co ming off an 
impressive 21-10 season that 
included a playoff berth in the 
NCAA Division II regionals, 
needed to replace four players 
who gradua~ed from last year's 
squad . It has successfully done 
that. 

Four top prep athletes have 
signed letters of in tent to play for 
the Tritons next season . , 

According to the team 's head 
coach Duncan McFarland, these 
are top athletes who can con-
tribute to the Tri tons immediate-
ly. 

"This recruiting class tS the 
strongest UCSD has ever had in 
women 's volleyball ," McFarland 
swted in a june press release. 

The Tritons IQst Leslie Punel-
Ii, the team's 2001 co-captain 
and MVP; Christine Kueneman, 
the team's other co-captain ; 
Shannon Hawes and Kearney 
Visser. 

Attempting to fill their shoes 
will be Kim Bender, Stacy Dun-
smore, Teresa Ohta and Kendra 
Canape. 

Bender is an outside hitter 
from Jamul. Calif. She is the 
younger sister of former UCSD 
volleyball player Allison Bender, 
who in 2000 earned the Out-

standing Senior Student-Athlete 
Award. Kim Bender was a twO-
time all-league selection at 
Grossmol1l High School and was 
team captain for two seasons. 
She also played fo r five years 
with Club Pacific. 

Dunsmore is a 5-10 outside 
hitter from Vista High School in 
Oceanside, Calif. She should 
prove to be a potent addit ion to 
the Tritons' offensive attack. 
Dunsmore played for Sun west 
Volleyball Club. 

Replacing Kueneman , who 
led UCSD with 714 assists in her 
senior season, wi ll be Ohta, a 5-
6 setter from Cypress, Calif. In 
addition to playing for Whitney 
High School , she was also a 
member of the Cal juniors Red 
team, one of me top club pro-
grams in the nation last year. 

The final addition to the Tri-
tons ' roster will be Canape, a 6-
1 middle blocker from Brea 
Olinda High School in Brea, 
Ca lif. She showed tremendous 
athleticism in high school; she 
ran track and was voted "Most 
Athletic" in her senior class. 
Canape also played for th e 
Impact Club team. 

With these additions to the 
squad, the team may improve on 
last year's 21 wins. From the 
looks of this recruit ing class, it 
has a pretty good chance of 
doing it.

Title IX: 
Male athletes rule over 
women on the hardwood 
Continued f rom page 18 
momenl', femi nists all around San 
Diego are getting out thei r signs to 
come protest at the Guardian office. 
Oh wetl. It 's true. 

Take basketball. for example. 
Would YOll rather go , cc the Lakers 
take on the Sixers or the Comcts 
clash with the Monarchs? That's a 
tough ca ll , but, personally, I'd go 
wnh the men's game. The men are 
simply bette r than the women. The 
men arc bigger, stronger, faster and 
more athletic, on the whole, than 
their female coumerparts. 

I would take the Clippers, 
arguably one of the worst franchis-
es in NBA history, and put them 
against anyone of the Houston 
Comets' championship teams, and 
I will guaralltee a Clipper win . 
While I'm at it, I would put my life 
savings on last year 's national 
championship team from Duke 
against the mighty Comets' cham-
pionships teams. 

Think about a normal W BA 
ce lllcr, probably measuring around 
6-8 or 6-9 and maybe 220 or 230 
pounds, and put her against Carlos 
Boozer in the low post. He mea-
sures lip around 6-10 and 240 
pounds. 

I'm sorry, ladies. You could 
probably hold your own in soccer, 
or maybe even volleyball , but those 
aren't the big revenue sports. Bas-
ketball and football are the money-
makers . . And for the time being, 
those are the ones dominated by 
men. 

I would even argue that without 
the large amounts of money going 
toward men's basketball and foot-
ball, they wouldn 't be able to gen-
erate the precious dollars that keep 
women's sports in business. 

So, the next time you fern i-nazis 
start screaming that it is unfair to 
give men's sports so much money, 
take a look at the whole . picture: 
Men make money., 

Right about now, you're proba-
bly asking yourself, · Who does this 
guy think he is?" and "Tell me [ 
don 't have to listen to this guy any-
more after this issue." 

Well, to answer that, I'm the 
new co-sports editor and I will 
have a weekly column . Deal with it. 

For those of you who think that 
what I wrote is a bunch of crap, it's 
no!. Why? 

Because [ said so. 

Dostalek: 
She won several awards 
in her athletic career 
Continued f rom page 18 
seventh in UCSD history. 

This award, though arguably 
the biggest, is just one of many 
honors that Dostalek has accumu-
lated while at UCSD. 

Dostalek has twice been named 
UCSD 's Athlete of the Year, win-
ning the award for the past two 
years. She is also a three- time All-
America selection . 

• In addition to these prestigious 
awards, Dostalek was highly deco-
ra ted her senior year. 

She was a member of the NCAA 
Division II Championship All -
Tournament Team and was named 
Outstanding Offensive Player of 
the CAA Division II Champi-
onship. Dostalek was also named 
to the ational Soccer Coaches 
Association of America All-Ameri -
can tirst team, All-CCAA first team 
and the All-Far West Region first 
team. 

She was also a finalist for the 
Honda Award, given to the Divi -
sion II Collegiate Woman of the 
Year, and was invi ted to the Umbro 
Select All-Star Classic. 

Locally, Dostalek was named 
UCSD 's Woman of the Year, one of 
12 UCSD athletes of the year and 
the Guardian's 2000-2001 Female 

The UCSD Guardian 

Athlete of the Year. 
What is especially impressive is 

that she did all of this while mak-
ing the jump from Division III to 
Division II competition . It might 
have been in timidating for some 
players to step right into one of 
the toughest Division II confer-
ences in th e nation, but Dostalek 
handled it with ease, as she 
seemed to do with th e competi -
tion she faced throughout her 
career. 

Dostalek is a very special player 
who, as her sta tisti cs show, is more 
than deserving of all of the awards 
that she has received throughout 
her career.
