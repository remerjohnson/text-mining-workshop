Growers 'Attempt Biggest Con Job in History' ~·Chavez 
by John Haberstrob 

Staff Writer 

California growers are '~at­
tempting to pull the biggest con job . 
in the history 0( California on the 
people of this state" in their 
campaign against Prop. 14, United 
Farmworkers President Cesar 
Chavez charged Wednesday at 
UO)D. 

Over 1000 people januned the 
Mandeville Auditorium to hear 
Chavez ask the growers to stop 
"the big lie" in their campaign 
against the Farmworkers 
Initiative, as he opened the "voter 
education" phase of the "Yes on 
14" campaign. 

Also appearing at the rally was 
activist Tom Hayden, who said the 
California corporate power 
structure-which, he charged, is 
intimately tied with California's 

multi-million dollar agribusiness -
is lined up against Prop. 14. 

The big lie, according to Chavez, 
is the growers' contention that 
Prop. 14 will, violate property 
rights. The claim is based upon the 
portion of the proposition which 
would allow union organizers to 
come on fann property to lobby 
fanners for three hours a day. 

The access right was supported 
last week by the US Supreme 
Court, when it refused an appeal by 
growers of a California Supreme 
Court decision affirming the ac-
cess rule. 

Chavez also charged growers 
with deceiving the voters by 
makinR it seem as thouRh small 
growers are the chief opponents to 
the proposition. One has only to 
look at a list of contributors to the 
"No on 14" campaign, Chavez said, 
to know who the main opponents 

Cesar Chavez [TT Photo: Gretchen 
Talbot) 
are. Among the leading con-
tributors, Chavez said, are 
Southern Pacific Railway, the 
California Chamber of Commerce, 

and Blackwell Oil. 
Chavez opened his twelve-

minute speech by saying " there is 
only one real issue (in the cam-
paign) - whether farmworkers are 
going to have the right to exercise 
their vote in a secret election." He 
~expressed his wish that the 
growers would confront th~ issue 
ratber than try to deceive the 
voters. 

The United States has the largest 
food supply on earth, and yet, 
Chavez alleged, those who harvest 
it do not have enough food for 
themselves. Thus, according to 
Chavez, the . fannworkers are 
saying, " 'we feed you, vote yes on 
14 so we can feed ourselves.' " 

Corporate Agribusiness 
Hayden maintained that 

agribusiness is intimately tied in 
with California's largest cor-
porations . Standard Oil of 
California and Occidental 
Chemical Co. supply fertilizer and 
Ralston-Purina supplies livestock 
feed to agribusiness. California's 
largest banks playa major role in 
financing large agricultural 
concerns, Hayden said. 

Because of the above situations, 
Hayden concluded that what 
profits agribusiness is also 
profitabl, for California's cor-
porate power structure . For that 
reason, California ' s power 
structure has aligned itself against 
Proposition 14, claimed Hayden. 

McElroy Calls for 
Campus-wide Referendum 

Chancellor McElroy Monday 
charged the UCSD Student 
Election Board to " conduct a 
campus-wide referendum on 
student governments this fall 
quarter." The Chancellor, citing 
university policy, said he is 
authorized to establish student 

may only be instituted upon 
request from a petition signed by 
either 20 percent of all registered 
students, or by three out of the five 
student governments ..: the college

university. McElroy said he feels 
" He must be able to call for a 
student vote if he is to responsibly 
exercise his authority."

The Enrollment Projection 
Review Committee's Task Force 
on Enrollment Issues yesterday 
recommended that UCSD continue 
its controlled growth policy for 
both undergradullte and graduate 
enrollments. 

" The current steady-state plan 
for 8000 undergraduate-
enrollments should be maintained 
and that any decision to increase 
this number should be based on a 
firm commitment for appropriate 
increases in resources to maintain 
the planned student/faculty ratio 
and associated T A and in-
structional research support," the 
task force said in its report. 

The task force worked over the 
summer, re-examining current 
enrollment planning and making 
recommendations to the full 
review committee on policies 
regarding undergraduate and 
graduate enrollments, lower 
division to upper division mix and 
the possible control of majors. 

'!be Committee's Duties 

The Enrollment Projections 
Review Committee utilizes 
demographic projections for UCSD 
enrollments to establish campus 
planning policy. The task force was 
established by Chancellor McElroy 
to " conduct a more detailed study 
of enrollment issues than is 
possible during the regular 
meetings of the review com-
mittee." 

The task force showed great 
concern in its report for resource 
support. It recommended the 
number of admissions be 
decreased if the planned ratios 
cannot be provided because of lack 
of resources. Given the necessary 
resources, the task force felt the 
8000 level for enrollment could be 
maintained during the projected 
period of decreased total 
enrollment and application 
demand in the eighties. 

The task force said "the primary 
[actor in determining graduate 
enrollment plans should be the 
assessment, by individual 
deparbnents, of desired critical 
size and graduate studenVfaculty 
ratio." The task group also felt T A 
requirement. and graduate 
student IUppOI't and space should 
be COnsidered. 

The talk force report 8dvocated 
action to improve the raUo of upper 
division to low .. dMaion .udentl. 
The two WlYS the report Mid UiI 

best could be accomplished is to 
r.muce attrition and to keep a 
higher proportion of " native 
students." (Native students are 
students that started at UCSD as a 
freshman, and the task group 
hopes to increase " the portion of 
our native students who move on to 
the upper division leveL") 

No Increase in JC Students 

The report also urged the 
campus not to attempt to improve 
the upper divisionllower division 
ratio by increasing junior college 
transfers. The report said junior 
college transfers would have a 
difficult time fitting into the 
academic structure of Revelle and 

Part Two 

Fourth. It also reflected a concern 
of many faculty members that 
transfer students from junior 
colleges are not satisfactorily 
prepared and " reduce the quality 
of upper division courses." 

Placing a control on the number 
of students in each major as a 
means to control the number of 
admissions is a policy the task 
force decided should not be 
adopted at UCSD. After 
examination of suell controls used 
at UC Berkeley, Irvine and UCLA, 
the report . concluded controls are 
difficult to manage and should only 
be used " after a detailed and ex-
tensive consideration of all 
alternatives has occured. . 

Howev~r, some members of the 
Election Board are vehemently 
opposed to McElroy's call for the 
referendum, and said he does not 
have the authority for such an 
action. Muir board representative 
Andy Schneider said that, 
"Students alone hold the power and 
authority to organize a student 
governance structure." Schneider 
said that McElroy, in calling the 
referendum, " has violated UCSD's 
Election Board . Code of 
Procedures. " 

The Election Code, approved by 
the Chancellor one year ago, 
specifies under what cir-
cumstances a referendum can be 
called. It details that a referendum 

Student F·iles : No Big Secret

News EdItor 
'Ibis is the conclusion of a two-.. rt 
story dealing with student fOes at 
UCSD. Friday's article dealt witb 
tbose mes in tbe Registrar's office, 
wbDe today'! studies otber sundry 
files maintained wltbln tbe 
~Iverslty. 

:. ' I ! ~ • Hugh French [IT Photo: Bill 
Brooks) 

Rest assured, there is no 
university intelligence agency 
gathering complete files on 
students at UCSO. 

The overall system which is now 
in effect is that those ofticea or 
departments which find it 
necessary to keep fUes do 10, but on 
u limited a bula .. poaible. 

The PsychoIoc1cal and Coun-
... Department baa eliminated 
the need for files completeb'. 

Students initally fill out a card 
detailing little more than their 
name to, in the words of a 
department spokesman, 
" minimize paper." No case 
r:ecords or files are kept on 
student's sessions, and the cards 
that are initially filled out are 
thrown away within a five year 
period. 

"Very Tight Setup" 
Those files kept at the Student 

Health Center are available only to 
the medical staff and consultants. 
Dr. V. Robert Allen, Director of the 
center, stated that they had a 
" very tight set up," and that "all 
confidentiality is assured." 
Student health records are 
released only with the individual's 
pennission, or with judicial 
subpoena (resulting from such 
incidents as car accidents) . As a 
precautionary measure, signature 
checks are perfonned on those 
students who wiah to look at their 
files. Dr. Allen said that for 
medical reasons, the files are kept 
"forever." 

The various provosts' offices 
contain a set of fUes similar to the 
academic transcripts found in the 
Registrar's office. Within them is 
the student's initial letter of ap-
plication, grade transcripts, and a 
sheet upon which the counselor 
makes periodic notes when 
meeting with the student (a 
"Jomny still isn't sure of his 
major" type of comment) . The 
fUel are only open to counselors, 
the student in question, and the 
proVOll 

Vice-Oumcellor and Dean of 

Student Affairs, George Murphy, 
has retention of student 
disciplinary records. He noted that 
there were actually "very few of 
them," and that access was limited 
to, "myself, my administrative 
assistant, and the student reviewed 
in the file." Additionally, he stated 
that, " once the disciplinary matter 
is resolved all files are destroyed, 
and all references to the incident 
are expunged." 

Arrest Reports 
Campus Police Chief Hugh 

French claimed that besides in-
jury, theft and victim reports, " the 
only files we keep are on those 
we've arrested." Noting that there 
are 50 to 60 annual arrests in-
cluding both students and non-
students, French stated that only 
the police themselves and the 
individuals on file could look at the 
arrest report. 

Joyce Hittenberger, working out 
of the graduate student depart-
ment, summed up a typical 
statement of all who were 
questioned by saying, " our files 
are very routine." She' noted that 
basically they only h ld academic 
transcripts , the original ap-
plication . departmental 
recommendations, employment 
fonns, and a small scattering of 
other such paraphernalia . 
Graduate students can study their 
files upon making a written 
request. 

So if you believe someone is 
following you around campus and 
taking notes, it's probably only 
your imagination ..... or your 
creditors.

councils and the Student 
Cooperative Union. 

Hearing Process 
The Chancellor also asked the 

board to develop a hearing process 
which would evaluate a student 
governance task force report on 
possible alternatives to the Student 
Cooperative Union (Triton Times, 
Oct. 8). 

The task force , a nine member 
board that worked this summer 
researching governance structures 
currently in existence, detailed 
three viable fonns of government 
for Uo)D in its report. 

The models included: 1) a form 
of electoral government utilizing a 
Legislative Body composed of 
students from the existing college 
councils, the general student body, 
and a voluntary student caucus; 2) 
a non-electoral model utilizing a 
General Assembly composed of 
students participating on a 
voluntary basis, somewhat similar 
to the present government; 3) a 
parliamentary model utilizing a 
General Council composed of 
students elected from student 
organizations, coalitions or 
alliances and a Student Forum to 
accomodate students who desire to 
act independently of the General 
Council. 

Hearings on the report were 
scheduled by McElroy the fourth, 
fifth and sixth weeks of this 
quarter. Finalization of ballot 
alternatives and the development

Illegal Aliens Pose Threat to US

Our national economy, already

one and two million hold US jobs.

tempting employers to bin them 
and UDdtrcut otber workers. 
Dlegal aliens are taking from all 
US citizens jobl whicb rig~ly 
belong to US citizens. 

In addition, they are often using 
public services, which cost 
everyone tax money, while 
themselves paying little or nothing 
in taxes. Furthennore, they are 
exporting to families outside the 
United States billions of dollars 
which belong here, Dol down the 
drain. In total, this disease costs 
our economy over tbirteea bOliOD 
dollan per year, and, with ~ 
nation and increased illegal e~ 
tries, the cost is rising. 

megal aliens, since they are Dot 
US citizens, do Dot deserve any of 
the rights guaranteed to US

Simchas Torah: Time for Rejoicing 
Throughout the ages Simchas 

Torah has been observed with 
warmth, enthusiasm and fervor 
which is an inspiration to those who 
witness and participate in the 
celebration . 

One still witnesses true Simcha, 
sees joy pouring forth from the 
innennost crevices of the soul. Not 
a joy characterized by levity and 
frivolity, but rather deep soul 
searching and all encompassing 
exaltation at one and the same 
time. It is not the kind of joy which 
drags one down to the trivialities of 
life, but rather a joy which elevates 
one above the narrow and petty, to 
achieve a new perspective of life, 
and to gain a deeper purpose for it. 

A lesson of Simchas Torah can be 

learned from the custom that all 
Jews dance together on this 
Festival of Rejoicing. ALL JEWS-
Jews in the United States, Jews in 
Israel, Jews in Russia, Jews in 
Hong Kong. ALL JEWS - aged and 
dignified Rabbis and Chassidim -
men who are steeped in the most 
profound and intricate phases of 
Torah learning, persolL'! whose 
very contenances radiate 
thoughtfulness and wisdom dance 
joyously before the Torah with the 
vigor and enthusiasm of children. 

These intellectual and spiritual 
giants who measure their every 
word, whose every gesture 
bespeaks dignity and deliberation, 
rejoice before the Torah with the 
agility, the utter abandon one only

sees in YO Wlgsters. 
ALL JEWS - dancing together-

truly rejoicing with the Torah -
imbued with the conviction of its 
absolute relevance, its utter In-
dispensability to life. To them, life 
without Torah is·unthinkable. 

Only a life of Torah bas purpose 
and meaning. Thus, when they 
look at the Sefer Torah, rolled up 
and covered, they realize, each 
within the bounds of his own In-
tellect that this scroll is their 
reason for being - their Tree of 
Life . 

The less knowledgable are 
moved by the joy emanating from 
the more intellectual , who are in 
turn moved by the simple 
exuberance emanating from the 
faith of the less learned; resUlting 
in a Wlified display of Joy in Torah. 

This is the message of Simchas 
Torah. ALL JEWS rejoicing 
together with their Torah, their 
most precious possession, since 
only through observance of Torah 
can they be redeemed and then 
bring redemption to the rest of 
Mankind. 

Chabad Simchas Torah 
celebration will take . place on 
Saturday night, October 16th at 
7:30. The entire Jewish com-
mWlity, YOWlg and old, is invited to 
rejoice.

to hear him talk? 

That's what happened last 
Friday afternoon wben 

King Golden at campaign speach 
held on Revelle Plala , Friday . . 

congressional candidate King 
Golden came to speak before a 
sparse crowd of 20 to 30 students on 
Revelle Plaza. Ironically, one of 
Golden's most articulated points 
was that the ! views of the last 
generation are still being reflected

set for the seventh week. The close 
of the eighth week should find 
publication of the referendwn and 
ballot argwnents, and balloting is 
expected by McElroy for the ninth 
week ofthe quarter. 

Nwnerous questions still remain 
over the entire referendum 
process. Among them is the still 
unresolved problem of what · 
number of voting students con-
stitutes a minimwn turnout to 
insure the election's "legitimacy." 
Additionally, the matter of ~ 
eluding other models (govern-
ments) on the ballot still has not 
been resolved Perhaps the most 
pressing queStion is whether the 
referendum process will ever get 
underway. 

Schneider, commenting on the 
proposed,referendwn, stated that, 
"I refuse to add my personal 
legitimacy to any highly suspect 
student government which should 
grow out of a task fonn charged by 
the Chancellor and a referendwn 
convened by the Chancellor." He 

furth~r said that, "In my opinion 
there is no referendwn until such 
time as students appear before the

For the past two years, the US

When asked about his stand on 
the energy issue, Golden expressed 
his interest in developing a variety 
of potential resources, including 
windmills and solar energy. He 
said he would support legislation 
that would provide an incentive for 
the consumer to reduce con-
swnption, thereby alleviating the 
shortage problem. 

Golden Shows Concern 
Golden showed concern over the 

breakdown in the federally funded 
student program, in particular the 
growing nwnber of defaults. He 
said that a system should be 
constructed to eliminate the 
problem by extending the loan over 
a lifetime. He feels that because 
college graduates have 
statistically higher earnings, it is 
not unreasonable to expect them to 
repay the cost of their educaUon. 

Golden also spoke about the 
pressing need for a health care 
program in San Diego and the

Members of the staff would do 
specialized research for the Reg

to committee member Ann Car-
berry. 

Through such' a research staff, 
Carberry said, the committee 
hopes to add a student perspective 
to the fWlding process. 

The research staff proposal is 
important, she said, " Because it is 
the first time the concept of a

committee has been realistically 
approached ...

'Who's the Greatest R&R Band? 
by Tim MacKeDZie 

Arts Editor . 
SInce The Who Is adamant in Its 

claim of beir!« tbe greatest rock 
and roll band in the world, I went to 
the Sports Arena fully especting an 
exciting, sharp perfonnance. For 
the most part, The Who delivered 
in a convincing fashion, demon-
strating that they may just be in 
the same league as the Stones and 
Led Zeppelin (let's leave 
Aerosmith out of this). 

Somewhat surprisingly, The Who 
don't have a new album to market 
on this tour, "forcing" them to 
perfonn their oldies (much to the 

deli~t to the audience). The fU'St . 
half of their show was a greatest 
hits package, followed by the 
perfonnance of Peter Townshend's 
rock opera Tommy. 

While the band appeared to be 
performing competenUy, the sound 
reverberating throughout the 
Sports Arena was te.rri~l~, 
especially with the mU~lc s 
maximum volume. The vlSual 
aspect of the show was enhanced 
by the use of laser lighting, 
deifying Roger Daltrey during 
"See Me, Feel Me." 

For an ugly band, though, they 
do manage to generate audience 
enthusiasm. Guitarist Peter 
Townshend demonstrated his 
uniQue ability to jump, run and 
slide while playing very well . 
Vocalist Roger Daltrey stomped 
and strutted about the stage, 
-twirling his mike at will and 
delivering his overblown, seldom 
on key vocals in a convincing 
manner . Between numbers 
Daltrey walked around in a circle 
on stage, like a man possesed by 
something. Why do you think they 
call it dope, Roger'? Bassist John 
Entwhistle was typically low-key, 
managing on occasion to inspire 
himself to tap his foot. Keith Moon 
was super behind the drums and 
didn't succeed in making a fool of 
himself. 

Hopefully The Who will come up 
with some exciting new material 
for future shows ("Squeeze Box" 
doesn't fit the bill.) It's too easy 
for the band to rely on past laurels, 
Tommy being a good ~Iample 
since it has been run mto the 
groWld from overexposure.

Tokyo String Quartet Plays 
With "Unity and Clarity" 

by Daniel Lee Sbawler 
Staff Writer 

In a string quartet, the musicians attemRt to play together in such a 
unity and clarity of motion that the effect is the sounds of the four in-
struments blend into one. The Tokyo String Quartet proved itself to be 
excellent last Friday evening in the Mandeville auditoriwn. 

The challenge of cohesion is' immensely more difficult in a string 
quartet where four individuals try to stay together than it is in an or-
chestra where 80 or so musicians perfonn with the same goal in mind. In 
a symphony. a mistake by one violin will be covered by the correctness of 
the other twenty. In a quartet, there is no room for error. 

The Tokyo quartet made few errors, and those that were made were 
more of the interpretive nature than of the blundering 'quality. The 
Quartet is well known for its emotional and melodic wannth. This was 
highly apparent, but often to the detriment of the rhythmic aspect of the 
piece. 

'l'his, however, is the style of the Tokyo quartet. They bring a youthful 
and invigorating approach to the art in direct contrast to the older 
established quartets, such as the Julliard, that . emphasize rhythmic 
security over all else. 

'Ibis manner of playing has its advantages. Very few quartets are as 
well in tune as the Tokyo quartet. They are almost without peer in this 
regard. This works. especially well in the modem and romantic pieces 
such as the Beethoven Quartet in C Major, Op. 59, No.3 and the Bartok 
Quartet No.4, but it is not as successful in the earlier classical and 
baroque works such as the Haydn Quartet in B nat Major, Op. 50, No.l. In 
the latter, the rhythmic precision was sufficienUy lacking to cause 
distractions from the overall effect. 

The Tokyo quartet, however, proved itself entirely capable of p~ying 
with precision when ·the need arose, as they demonstrated m the 
Allegretto pizzicato of the Bartok. Nothing in music can compare to the 
difficulty of a group of strings trying to play in pizzicato unison. likewise, 
a very few things in music can compare to the excitement generated by a 
group playing such a passage in such an admirable manner as did the 
Tokyo quartet. 

The Tokyo String Quartet, composed of Koichiro Harada, Kikuei Ikeds, 
Kazuhide Isomura , and Sadao Harada, is well on Its way to becoming one 
of the top quartets in the world, a remarkable feat since their first as)-
pearance was a scant five years ago. Judging from last Friday's concert, 
they are here to stay.

Staff Writer 

"We won but we still have a lot of work to do," waterpolo coach Gary 
Becker said after his team defeated Whittier College, 12~, last Friday. 

It was UCSD's first waterpolo victory of the season after having opened 
with three consecutive losses. "We played well and made fewer mistakes 
so that helped us," commented Becker, who was quite unhappy with his 
team's previous mistake-prone performances. 

Following an evenly contested first quarter, the Tritons opened the 
second period with an early goal to break the 2-2 deadlock. Corky Hull 
scored the goal to give the Tritons, who had a man advantage due to a 
Whittier foul, a 3-2 lead. 

Goalie Bob Ali held Whittier scoreless throughout the second period as 
UCSD tallied three more times, twice by Frank Ebel, to give the Tritons a 
6-2 halftime advantage. 

The third quarter opened with Whittier quickly trimming UCSD's lead 
to two goals. Mter exchanging goals with the score 6-4, the Triton's 
Dennis Thomas connected on a 25-foot shot to make the tally 8-5. Soon 
afterwards, the San Diegans were again working around the Whittier 
goal and Hull scored his third point of the game on an assist from 
Thomas. 

Whittier failed to capitalize and cut into the Tritons lead when their 
penalty shot from 10 feet out was blocked by Ali. UCSD was given the 
same opportunity a few seconds later and scored when Steve Shellhamer 
made his penalty shot, giving the Tritons a five-point lead at the end of the 
third quarter. 

The fourth period was a defensive battle between the two teams, as 
neither squad was able to work aroUnd their opponent's goal. -With the 
score ll~ going into the last minute of play, the Triton's working the ball 
around for their final shot, scored with 30 seconds left on the clock, giving 
them a 12~ victory . 

Tritons Run to Balboa 
On a smoggy, one-hundred 

degree afternoon last Saturday the 
UCSD cross country team COIn-
peted with more than 150 runners 
in the Long Beach Track and }<'ield 
Federation Cross-Country meet. 

Host team Long Beach State won 
the contest, held on a flat six-mile 
course. 

UCSD freshman, Alan Bernath, 
was the top Triton finisher, coming 
in five minutes after the lead 

runner. 
Coach Andy Skief was ex-

ceptionally pleased with the entire 
performance of the Tritons as they 
edged out league rival Bio la 
College. UCSD placed three 
runners in the top 75 compared to 
Biola's two. 

This Saturday the Tritons will be 
running in the Aztec Invitational at 
Balboa Park.

Badminton 
to Begin 

Tomorrow 
by Dave Cohen . 

UCSD's badminton team will be 
fighting the odds when it travels to 
Grossmont tomorrow for the 1976 
league opener. 

"We've only been practicing for 
- two weeks, while all the other 

teams have started their 
schedules," says coach Judy 
Sweet. " It puts us at a distinct 
disadvantage. " 

The Tritons finished second in a 
six team league last season, and 
although just four of the six teams 
remain, Sweet says the com-
petition will be keener this year. 

Though the team has practiced 
for just a short time, it appears 
strong with a · large group of 
returning veterans. Carol Stein-
berg and Gary Kreitzer return in 
the mixed doubles division. Other 
returnees include Kirk Feinberg, 
Pat Melese, Harry Yen, and Don 
Yarkin in the men's doubles 
division. Liz Noll and Carol 
Steinberg will bolster the women's 
doubles units in their returning 
roles. 

For those unfamiliar with the 
workings of intercollegiate bad-
minton, the games involve 13 
separate matches including 
women's and men's singles, 
women's and men's doubles and 
mixed doubles. The number one 

Liz Noll [TT Photo: Gretchen Talbot] 
mixed doubles unit plays the OJ>-
position's number one unit, the 
number two unit plays the number 
two unit of the other team and so 
on. The club will play only six such 
league contests this year which 
leaves little margin for error. 
Although there are three individual 
tournaments which don't count in 
the standings, the team will have to 
look solely to intersquad scrim-
mages and practice to sharpen its 
skills. 

But a club that has the same 
coach and many of the same 
players returning from a second-
place-finishing year need not 
worry too much. The raw, in-
dividual talent will no doubt mold 
itself quickly into a solid team and 
fans will be able to look for a club 
as representative as last year's.
