UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 25,1988 VOLUME 60, #36 

. . 

L.g_a •• llon - University of California Students Association (UCSA) announced the proposal of a 
bill concerning differential treatment of students last Monday during a press conference at the Capitol 
Building in Sacramento. 

Goal of UCSA bill to 
abolish -racism, sexism 
By PETER MESSROBIAN 
N~wsEditor 

Racism and sexism at the 
University of California were the 
primary topics at last weekend's 
UC Student Association (UCSA) 
Student Summit, which was 
attended by over 250 students, 
including 23 from UCSD. 

The three-day conference 
(Feb. 20-22) began with work-
shops on a wide range of sub-
jects, including affirmative 
action, housing and parking, 
student government constitu-
tions, voter participation, 
national lobbying, academic 
affairs, and student fees, among 
others. 

Several seminars were held on 
Sunday,andthei~ueof"Cam­
pus Climate" dominated the 
agenda. Campus climate is 
defined by the UCSA as the level 
of educational equity being pro-
vided to students. Educational 
equity is the concept of giving all 
students equal ed ucational op-
portunities, regardless of race, 
gender or ethnicity. 

"There was one pecific thing 
to be ... done, and that was to 
meet with legislators on Mon-
day," said Warren sophomore 
senator and UCSD executive 
lobby director Brett Franklin, 
who organized the UCSD dele-
gation' trip. Ten group of four 
or five tudent each lobbied two 
of the 10 state cnator and 
a !.emblypeople from the an 
Diego area . 

Both a bill and a resolution 
were propo ed by SA Mon-
day morning, and during the day 
the UC A delegate lobbied mo t 

of the senators and assembly-
people for support. 

The bill [AB 4071] puts into 
the educational code ... that all 
students have the right to an 
equitable education within an 
equitable environment," Frank-
lin said. A resolution (ACR 126) 
was also proposed that Franklin 
described as "sending a strong 
message to the university .... 
that there is a problem of dif-
ferential treatment." 

Differential treatment, or 
racism and sexism, is described 
by the U CSA as "pervasive within 
the University of California," and 
"the most widely-ignored factor 
influencing the success and fail-
ure of underrepresented stud-
ents . . . " 

AB 4071, entitled the Educa-
tional Equity and Quality As-
sessment Act, states that "a 
primary goal of every educational 
institution should be to ensure 
an equitable educational envir-
onment for each student, regard-
less of gender or ethnicity," and 
it decries the fact that there are 
few ways, if any, to measure the 
equity of a particular campus 
environment. 

The bill requires that "a pro-
gram of systematic longitudinal 
data collection [data collected 
over time] utilizing information 
obtained through urveys of tu-
dent and faculty [be done] ... .. 
The urvey would be used to 
determine what need!. to be done 
to create an equitable environ-
ment for the tudent of the 
univer it . 

The resolution make imilar 
tatements regarding differential 

treatment, and call for the 

"adoption of specific policy 
statements by the University of 
California acknowledging the 
existence of differential treatment 
and providing a clear institu-
tional commitment that will not 
be tolerated." 

All of the members of the 
UCSD delegation interviewed 
agreed that the conference was a 
worthwhile experience. "I told 
them that what I expected them 
to gain out of this was effective 
lobbying techniques, and insight 
into the way the California state 
government is run," Franklin 
said. 

Franklin, who attended last 
year's conference, called this one 
a greater success. "Last year we 
didn't introduce bills or anything 
to the legislators," he said. "This 
year we were going in and say-
ing, 'We need your support on 
this bill,' 'We need you to co-
author this bill.' " 

"The position UCSA is taking 
is that there's affirmative action 
programs at each VC, but there's 
never been any kind of assess-
ment of how effective or ineffec-
tive these programs are," aid 
Third College enior and confer-
ence attendee Mary Morales . 

Morales de cribed the lobby-
ing effort as difficult at times, 
becau e"l feel that omeofthese 
senator and a semblymen are 
very much removed fro m the 
campu and educational system 
... orne of them didn 't belie e 
[differential treatment] was going 
on, or it was worth putting 
money into." 

Morale explained that thi i

UCSD may get 
FM station 
By A.M. BEZZERIDES 
Associtlt~ News Editor 

Due to an agreement with San 
Diego radio station KSDO, 
UCSD may become the eventh 
UC campus to have a FM radio 
station. However, controversy 
exists over the future control of 
the station. 

According to Laura Long, 
assistant vice chancellor for bus-
iness services, UCSD owns one 
of the many towers on Mt. 
Soledad . This tower can broad-
cast to the wealthiest areas in 
San Diego, which is attractive to 
a radio station's advertisers . (In 
negotiations with the University, 
KSDO agreed to grant three 
things in exchange for broadcast 
space at the Mt. Soledad tower:) 
• To cover the cost of building 

transmitting facilities and the 
rental of the tower space, UCSD 
would be paid $1,500 per month . 
• KSDO would broadcast two 

daily 6O-second segments con-
taining public service annouce-
ments about UCSD between the 
morning and evening commut-
ing times. 

• Finally, KSDO would clear 
one half-hour of air time per 
week on both their FM and AM 
station for special university 
programming. However, this 
amount of allotted time double 
after two years if KSDO doesn't 
obtain a Federal Communica-
tions Commission (FCC) licen e 
for UCSD to broadcast on a FM 
frequency. 

Currently, Long reported , the 
60-second public service mes-
ages, which inform listeners of 

current events concerning the 
campus, are being broadcasted 
regularly by KSDO diskjockeys. 

These public service announce-
ments, which are compiled by 
the UCSD Public Information 
Office, are independent from the 
third provision of the agreement, 
said Robert Horwitz, a commu-
nication professor. He said that 
the hour per week set aside by 
KSDO would be designed for 
creative university programming 
from various s·ources. 

One of these sources includes 
a future plan of the communica-
tion department. Horwitz ex-

Reception for new endowed 
chair recipient hosted 

Christo H. Papadimitriou. recently 
appointed to the Irwin Mark and Joan 
Klein Jacobs Chair in Information 
and Computer Science at the Univer-
sity of California , San Diego , was 
honored along with Dr. and Mrs . Jac-
obs by UC D Chancellor Richard C. 
Atkinson with a reception at Univer-
sity House Feb. 24 . 

Papadimitrious. a former professor 
of com puter science and operation 
research at Stanford University, is 
internationally known for his re earch 
in computer cience . 

He is the author of four book , has 
contributed to two others, and ha 
written more than 75 professio nal 
papers . He has been an invited speaker 
at man y national and international 
meetings, and serves on the editorial 
board of several professional journals . 

The main focus of Papadimitriou's 
work is a field called complexity 
theory. 

"Some problem which require a 
computer to solve appear to be so 
complex that they are vitually unsol-
vable," Papadimitriou said. "The the-
orie that I work with try to find out if 
this is an inherent property of the 
problem, or if other methods can be 
found to solve the problem." 

The Jacobs Chair is funded by a 
$250,000 gift from Irwin Jacob and 
his wife Joan . Jacobs left UCSD to 
fo und the Linkabit Corporation and is 
currently president of Qua1comm, Inc. 
The annual income from the endow-
ment will be available to the chair-
holder to support teaching and 
research activities.

KS DT, UCSD's student-run

taking part in the KSDO broad-

KSDT is currently working on a

"ucs D Focus." She sa id that an 
audition tape has been submit-
ted to Sherman George, a visual 
arts media professor, as well as a 
written proposal to the Media 
Policy Committee for approval. 

According to the proposal , 
KSDT's program would have a 
format that covered "news high-
lights, future calendar events, 
and in-depth reports of stories 
drawn from the broad range on 
activities occurring within the 
UCSD community." 

In accordance with the latter 
part of the agreement, KSDO's 
lawyers are working on the de-
tails of applying for a license for 
the University. If it becomes 
licensed , it will be owned and

frequency will give the Uni ve r-

Hunter S. Thompson 
The Fat in the Fire 

The Celtic a nd the Lakers clashed again on Sunday afternoon . The p read was 3 at the Forum , but at halftime the Lakers led by 
20, a nd Boston was bei ng emba rrassed. But then, a bo ut four minutes 
into the th ird quarter, the t ide turned : Kevin Mc Hale a nd Dennis 
Jo hnson ran wild , a nd the Celtics were suddenl y up by 4 at the 
q ua rter. It wa s a stunning 20-5 treak that a ppare ntly des troyed the 
gizzards of the Lakers a nd remind ed everybod y who sa w it that 
profess io nal basketball in America , at it s best , is the most a we ome 
sight in sports. 

It wa s about t h i time, around the start of the quarter, that t he 
Republican ca ndidates bega n their Big Debate in New Ha mps hire , 
which was carried o n CN a nd PBS. It was a majo r po lit ica l event -
o ne that no serious polit ical j ournalist would think o f miss ing. But I 
was a lone in the ho use at the t ime, and I would have plunged a fork 
in to the flesh of a nybody wh o t ried to cha nge cha nnels. 

T here was no d oubt in m y mind: G ive n a choice between elega nt 
basketball a nd low-rent po litics - even the choosing of the next 
Pre id ent - I locked down tight on the basketball. A nd 0 d id a lot 
of o ther people - not all of them mindless beer drunks who care 
not hi ng for polit ics, never vote a nd degrad e the who le conce pt of 
democracy by selling their birthrights for a mess of pottage. 

Som e of the people who stuck with C BS a nd the C eltics- Lakers 
game were serious politicians. power-m o ngers and even preside ntial 
hopefuls. Sen. Bill Bradley of New Je rsey, for insta nce, did no t fl ip 
over to CN and home in on t he wisd om of George Bush a nd P ierre 
du Pont. He knew that t he chance of it being a nyth ing but TV 
gibberish was about 1.000 to I, and so d id Al Davis, wh o wa tched the 
game in private , as alway, in the secl usion of his new SIS m ill ion 
home in Irwindale , surrounded by bag of old coins a nd dead a n im-
als . Jack icholson, once a mean political activist, wa see n in his 
customary courtside seat at the Forum. and the man who killed D on 
Bolles was slumped in his Death Row cell in Florence. Ari7., a nd 
watched nothing at all. 

Politics is no t the high-energy port that it used to be in Ame rica. The percentage of eligible voters who actually vote i down to less 
less than 45 percent and sinki ng. In the year's fir t t wo primaries, 
fewer than 500,000 voters destroyed the hopes and d rea ms of such 
once-powerful heavies as Vice President Bush a nd fo rmer Secreta ry 
of tate Al Haig, who went out in his customary blaze of ugline a nd 
did everything in his power to take Bush down wi th him. 

George Bush is doomed now, but nobody seem to know what it 
mean . Dole i beginning to look like Mi e Tyson o n speed , and the 
Preacher Robertson is going south, looking for a mo numental sweep 
on Super Tuesday. The GOP race has suddenly nar ro wed d own to 
Dole and Robertson - unless Patrick Bucha na n jumps in la te - a nd 
Dole will win in a walk unle Ro bertson canjump that o mino us li ne 
that separates the Religious R ight from the Political R ight. If that 
happens - when the boys o n the bus have to fo ll ow Robe rtson 
through cheering throngs of atheists at Se rb Hall o n the sou th sid e of 
Milwaukee - t hen we will have a very d iffe rent ga me o n our ha nds. 

It is a spoo ky not ion that, out of the South o n March 8, will eme rge 
two low-ridi ng preac hers with illegit ima te c hildren a nd no real power 
ba e in ei ther One of their parties a nd no comfortable expla natio n fo r 
why they a re both front-runners. 

Neither one of them will be nomi na ted , of cou rse, by they wi ll 
arrive at their respective co nvent ions with what the good 01' b oys 
down around Waycross, Ga. , used to call "a rock in your sock." 
Jesse, who is looki ng more and more like the J ack Johnson of the '80s, 
has never fig ured on coming into the first ballot wi th anything less 
than 15 perce nt of the delega tes, and R o bertson has eo ne to the 
burning bush a nd heard numbers like 33 percent a nd 44 percent a nd 
so metimes a~ high as 66 percent. 

T he main difference be twee n them is that Jesse doesn't think he 
will be p resident, but believes he ought to be, and Pa t Robertson 
knows in his barren little hea rt tha t the last thing in the wor ld he 
really ought to be i presid ent of the United States, bu t he has a 
quivering suspicion that he might be. 

Pat R obertson is not the first white preacher to make a run at the White House, although it ha been awhile since a ny of them was 
taken seriously. T he main man, of course, was the emi nent Willi am 
Jennings Bryan, who went to his grave in disgrace, st ill defend ing 
what H. L. Mencken calied his astounding argument aga inst the 
notion that "man is not a mammal." 

Mencken's obituary on Brya n still ra nks as one of the cruelest and 
most sa age outbursts in the history of American journalism: 

"The best verdict the most romantic edito rial wri te r could dredge 
up , save in the humorless South, was to the general effect that his 
imbecilities were excused by his earnestness - that under his clown-
ing, as under that of the juggler of otre Da me, there was a zea l of a 
steadfast soul. But this was apology. not praise ... If the fellow was 
sincere, then so was P.T. Barnum. The word is d isgraced and 
degraded by such uses. He was, in fac t, a c ha rla ta n, a moun tebank, a 
zany without sense of dignity ... He see med only a poor clod Ii ke 
those a round him, deluded by a childish theology, full of an almost 
pathological hatred of learning, a II human dignity. all beauty, all fi ne 
and noble things . He was a peasa nt come home to the ba rnyard . " 

In the small p ri n t of last weekend's political notes was one tha t 
aid : " Robertson wi ns 8 1 percent lands lide in Hawaii ca ucuse . "The 

Honolulu Star-Bulletin reports prayer meetings in halls and says "the 
party estab lish ment was pretty much thrown out .. . Like Michican 
and Florida, Hawaii li kely will be discounted because it can't hap pen 
here." But it is. And if t he liberals thought Bryan wa dangerou~. wait

Standards 
For TAs 
Editor: 

Befo re the begi nning of the 
quarter. when eve ryone is look-
ing th rougho ut the course offer-
ings a nd C AP E books, the 
tho ug ht of wha t classes and 
which professors to take is on 
everyo ne's mind . We generally 
feel confident that the courses 
are necessary and the professors 
co mpetent. But , when we write 
d ow n the numbe r of the discus-
sion section we wish to attend , 
we are tak ing the ri sk of getting a 
teachinj! ass istant (TA) who is 
incompetent and unable to do 
hi s/ her job. 

T he complaint tha t is heard 
the m ost, especially in math and 
science courses. is that the T A 's 
ha ve a hard time communicating 
in the English language, In sec-
t io n you're supp osed to discuss 
material that see med confusing 
in lecture. You a re confused even 
further if yo u come to section 
a nd ca n 't unde rstand what your 
TA is sayi ng. The problem isn 't 
j ust T As who ca n't speak E ng-
lish ; so me T As, who have mas-
tered the la ng u age, can 't com-
mu nicate thei r id eas well. T hey 
kno w the ma te rial backwa rds 

and forwards , but they ca n't get 
through to the student because 
of their lack of abilit y to com-
municate. 

Along with not being able to 
communicate, a problem with 
T As is that some d o n't know the 
material. Some T As don't go to 
lectures and end up teaching the 
class the way they want to , not 
the way the professor intends. As 
we all know, the professor want s 
the material learned the way it's 
taught. When a s ked to answer a 
diffic ult question , a T A will look 
baffled , and try to back out of 
answering the question by telling 
you to see the professor during 
office hours . or go to another 
stud y section . I know it is impos-
sible for a T A to know every-
thing, but to have a general know-
ledge of the class material would 
be nice . 

Sadly enough , there are some 
T As who reall y don't care about 
the student. They seem never to 
be available when people need 
extra help. They often don't at-
tend office hours and seldom re-
turn calls. I hardly think they are 
TAs for the money, but whatever 
the reason, they are not there fo r 
the service of the students. 

All T As aren't a s bad as I may 
have led you to believe. As a 
matte r of fa ct , the majority go 
out of their way to help stude nts

We Need 
Football 
at UCSD 

Editor: 
Why don't we have a football 

team at UCSD? Go to almost 
any other college in the United 
States, no matter what size, and 
you can see what we are missing. 
We don 't necessarily have to 
have a good team, either. It is 
what the team does for the school 
that is important. 

UCSD seems as if it is just four 
individual colleges with nothing 
in common. We need something 
to unify the student body and 
build pride in the school a s a 
whole in tead of getting all 
wrapped up in our own individ-
ual colleges. Since football is 
suc h a popular sport it would 
surely bring a large part of the 
campus together. Since so man y 
social events are centered around 
football games, they tend to be 
even more popular and attrac-
tive to students. Students need 
non-academic things to do on 
the weekends that are still related 
to campus life . It is very common 
to see deserted resident parking 
lot s on a Friday afternoon. 

Because UCS D has nothing 
that attracts students on the 
weeke nds, school becomes a 
place to be only during the week 
f6r classes. What kind or-college 
life is that? A college is supposed 
to offer many things to the stu-
dent , not just academics. I think 
it's great that UC SD has an 
excellent reputation for academ-
ics, but that is not the only 
important quality in a college. It 
is hard enoug h not having fra-
ternity and sorortity houses on 
campus contributing to the social 
scene. 

Another ad vantage of having 
a football team is that it pro-
motes the rest of the athletic 
program at the school. Because 
of the spirit generated by a foot-
ball team, students will be more 
willing to show their spirit and 
pride at other athletic events. 

There are many advantages to 
having a football team. It helps 
form pride and unity, and it sup-
ports the other athletic teams a s 
well. Socially it brings the stu-
dents together in an atmosphere 
ot her than the classroom. It could 
also keep people on campus on 
weekend s, which is necessary for 
o ne to enj oy the real meaning of 
college life.

Reagan/Hitler Cartoon Baseless Lie 
Editor: 

I finally mus t write 
a letter to the edilor 
of the Guardian . 
Us uall y, I merely 
chuckle al your lies 
or am 100 disgusted 
to bother with you. 
But finall y, you have 
done something com-
pletely ludicrous, baseless, and slanderous. I 
am referring to the editorial ca rtoon in last 
Thursday's iss ue [Feb. 18]. If you want to try to 
equate Ronald Reagan with Adolf Hitler, fine . 
But you had bette r have some facts to back up 
your case first. And while you spend the rest of 
your life Irying to find some, you may learn some 
his)ory. Though part of H itler's popularity can 

be attributed to his 
personality, what was 
far more important 
was his politics. Hitler 
brought forth eco-
nomic reform, turn-

- inl his country from 
embarrassed defeat 
and runaway inflation 
into the most power-

ful nation in Europe. Or had you for.otten that? 
Just admit that you arc trying to bad-mouth 

President Reagan in the only way you know 
how, with baseless lies and swecpin •• eneraliza-
tions. And don't think that you can get away 
with it any lonler, because the silent majority 
out here is startina to call your bluff.

Potash said . "With Sunny, at

ByGAYATRIG NA EKARA 
toff Writer 

D r . Harding E. Smith , professor of physics at UC D , and member of 
the enter for Astrophy ics and 

pace Science (CASS), along 
with Dr. Ross Cohen (aloof 
C ASS) and student Da vi d 
Moore and Barbara Uc hida 
recently identified a galaxy tha; 
" a p~ear to be similar to a young 
versIOn of our piral Milk Way 
Galaxy. which is 11-1 5 billion 
light years away." 

In his Phy ics 5 class, among 
other subject, Smith covers the 
basic theories of galaxy forma-
tion . He a nd hi colleague are 
interested in the impetus which 
causes galaxies to form. 

In the same vein, o thers may 
wonder what cause people to 
enter the fie ld of physics and 
astronomy. 

mith feels that his in trinsic 
curiousity about science was fur-
thered by his primary and secon-
dary ed ucat ion. He refers to his 
generation as the "Sputnik Gen-
eration," and he said , "If you 
were male and considered intel-
ligent, chool and society steered 

you towards scientific and mathe-
matical di ciplines ." 

" 1 had alwa s been interested 
in science, but it was only in high 
school that I reali7Cd I wanted to 
focu on astronomy and astro-
physics ." He find s physics appeal-
~.ng beca~se h ~ regards it as being 

th e baSIC sCIence by which WI! 
find out about the inner-work-
ings of the unive rse ." 

mith attended Cal Tech. the 
most highly acclaimed institution 
for physic , for his undergradu-
a.t~ educat ion . Although com pe-
tItive by nature, Smith said that 
the competition at Cal Tech was 
at a level which became destruc-
tive and unhealthy for so me . 

Furtherm ore, there were basi-
cally no humanities majors at 
Cal Tech. and mith believes 
that the pre ence of tudents 
majori.ng in a variety of disci-
pli nes IS co nducive to a broader 
intellectual atmosphere . For this 
reason, among others, he feels 
more of a n affinity with the insti-
tution where he received his 
P.h . D . University of Califor-
nIa at Berkeley . 

"There were perso nal mot iva-
t ions in favor of the Ba y Area , 

Dr. Harding E. Smith was part of the team that recently discovered a 
new galaxy.

and th ere were ma ny people who 
I wa nted to work with at Berke-
ley. Plus, there was the added 
attrac~ion of a fellowship ." 

Smi th was at Be rkeley in 1969 
:- a time that wa the most excit-
109 and the most turbulent period 
of th~ Universit y's history. He 

partl~I'pated in peaceful political 
actiVItIes , abstaining from less 
porducti ve con frontational 
event . He a dded , "My feelings 
were ex tremely ambivalent at 
the time s ince my father [who 
wa s a navigator in the Air Force) 
was M.I.A . in Vietnam ." 

In addition to instilling a sense 
of political awa renes ,S mith says 
Be rkeley also exposed h im to the 
field . of music and he says that 

p~ttmg p h ysics aside , music 
mIght have been his next career 
choice. 

After Berkeley he wa s offered 
a post-doctoral fellowship by 
UCS D, which he de c ided to 
accept. At this stage in his life he 
knew that he wanted to do re-
earch, and he came to UCSD to 

work with Margaret and Geof-
frey Burbidge, current and well-
renowned professors in physics. 

mith taught as a graduate 
student. and in add ition to liking 
the atmosphere that a universi ty 
pr?vides , he also happened to 
enJoy teaching. Smith find s stu-
dents at. UCS D to be interesting, 
e ne rgetIc, a nd stimulating. 

. Smith admits to a feeling of 
dIsmay at the lack (If preparation 
on the part of tudents in every 
area of the universi ty, be it 
humanities or math and cience . 
He said , "I ma y be getting old, 
but I find the s tud ents to be a lot 
m ore materiali stic today than 
th ey were 10 or 20 yea rs ago, and 
I find that alarming . Idealism 
has practically vanished ." 

E ven more perturbing to 
Smith is the low level of basic 
understanding and interest which 
plagues the area of science. "We 
li ve in a highly technological 
society, and it disturbs me that 
the general population lacks a 
ge.neral understanding about 
sCience. "

His face was a study of amaze-

ment as he asked, "How can 
people formulate an intelligent 
opinion about nuclear powerand 
other scientific issues without 
having an understanding of the 
basic principles involved?" 

Smith worries about the coun-
terculture that has sprung up in 
the country in opposition to 

tec.hnol~i~ . aDd the fu,nda.m~n­
tahst rehglOus attack on science 
"[which he sees as one of the 
results of the) tremendous scien-
tific illiteracy in the country." 

Smith confirms that this is an 
exciting time scientifically be-
cause of advances in understand-
ing the physics of basic forces 
high-energy physics, and super~ 
conductivity, but regrets that the 
requisite funding is not keeping 
pace with the advances that are 
occurring.

tio.ns in the galaxies and early 
UnIverse. We want to know how 
galaxies form , and this carries an 
implication of what the universe 
was like 15-20 billion yea rs ago." 

He hopes that a basic under-
standing of galaxy formation will 
be achieved by the time of his 
retirement , and also that the dis-
covery will have been made as to 
what energy mechani sms are 
responsible for quasars . 
. Science, according to Smith. 
IS a grand collaborative effort 
with. many different groups at-
tackmg a problem from a va riety 
of different areas. "You don't

Author tells of Indian Plight 
By S~EVE HOFFMAN thetic or a belligerent alcoholic. 
Guardllln Intern The re ult of this gap, according 

T here is a wide pread feel -ing in America that "all 
. the real Indians are gone." 

ThiS, according to noted author 
and ecologist Peter Matthiessen 
is the subt le root of racism which 
plagues the American Indian 
today. 

Matthiessen, who spoke to a 
crowd of several hundred at 
UCSD's Mandeville Auditorium 
last Thursday night, has written 
award-winning magazine articles , 

nov~ls, and non-fiction journals 
of hIS global travels. The topic of 
Thursday night's lecture, how-
ever, centered on what has proven 
to be Matthiessen's most con-
troversial topic - the conflict 
between government agencies 
and supporters of self-deter-
m!nation for American Indians. 
HIS research of the topic has 
resulted m .a detailed critique of 
the Amencan justice system 
which has been kept off book-
store shelves since 1983. 

This critique , In the Spirit of 
Crazy Horse. discusses the ten-
sion between the government 
Indian traditionalists, and 
members of a group called the 
American Indian Movement 
(AI M). This tension eventually 
erupted into a fatal shootou! 
between AIM members and a 
large team of FBI agents at the 
Pine Ridge Reservation , ironi-
cally located near Wounded 
Knee, South Dakota . One Indian 
was killed in the small battle, as 
were two of the agents who were 
trying to arrest a young Sioux 
for the theft of a pair of boots. 

While Matthiessen did not try 
to justify the close-range shoot-
ing of the two agents, he did 
argue that the man sentenced to 
two life terms for the crime 
Leonard Peltier, was railroaded' 
into prison because he had been 
an extremely vocal figure in the 
AIM movement. 

Much of Thursday night's talk 
was a fairly detailed discussion 
of the history of the treatment of 
American Indians, the formation 
of AIM, the Peltier case, and 
what Matthiessen charges to be a 
very blatant lack of evidence that 
Peltier is the man who shot the 
agents. According to Matthies-
sen, this case has proven to be an 
abuse of the justice system which 
is highly symbolic of a current 
fear of the Indian. 

Matthiessen stated that the 
American Indian is currently lost 
between the public's nostalgia 
for the nineteenth century te-
reo type as seen on countless 
television and movie screens, and 
at the other extreme, the ill-
supported notion that the Indian 
of today is either lazy and apa-

to Matthiesse n. is apathy . He 
urged that because these views 
are.perpetuated against a culture 
:whIch often chooses to remain to 

Its~lf ~nd does. not have a strong 
~ol.ce In AmerIcan society, there 
IS lIttle, or no movement to check 
the government's treatment of 
tribes and their land . 

Matthiessen sees the case of 
Peltier as a crucial precedent in 
determining future treatment of 
Indian nations by governmental 
agencies . The movement for a 
retrial of Peltier has gained the 
support of over 70 congressmen, 
members of the English and 
Canadia.n parliaments, Amnesty 
InternatIOnal , the Peace Prize 
Committee in Spain, and celeb-
rities such as Willie Nelson 
Jackson Browne and Rober; 
Redford . Citing thi s support, 

Mat~hlessen dryly asked , "Is it 
pOSSIble that [Peltier) might 
deserve a new trial?" 

While the case of Peltier is 
well-known in other countries ~at~h~essen's efforts to publi~ 
clze It In the United States have 
been generally limited to lectures 
such as the one given here last 
Thursday . 

.Even ,more inhibiting to Mat-
t~lessen s efforts, however, is that 
hIS book about the subject, In 
the Spirit of Crazy Horse. has 
been kept out of circulation since 
1983 when FBI agent David Price 
filed a $25 million libel suit 

a.gainst ~a.tthiesse n and his pub-
II her, Ylklllg Press . Also filing 
SUIt agamst the author was South 
i?akota's former governor Wil-
ham J . Janklow. 
. This case ha s caught the atten-

tIOn of many writers. publishers, 
and law experts, as it has been 
seen by many as an Orwellian 
attempt by the FBI to suppress 
free speech . 

. Several week s ago , a U.S . dis-
tnct court di smissed the case 
ruling that "speech about th~ 
government and its officers about 
how well or badly they carry out 
their duties, lies at the very heart 
of the First Amendment." Thus, 
the . book may soon again be 
available to the public. 

While the legal implications of 
the recent lawsuits over In the 
Spirit of Crazy Horse could have 
easily led to an angry diatribe on 

t~e part .of Matthiessen Thursday 
mght , hIS lecture kept a stringent 
focus on the efforts of the Ameri-
can Indian to remain on land 
which is "not only sacred to them 
but is their very life." 

Matthiessen made it clear 
throughout the lecture that he 
was. neither an authority on 
IndIan culture, nor was he trying 
to s~ek any personal gain from 
the tssue. Instead, quoting from 
Camus, he stated that he was 
making this effort toward in-
creasing public awareness of the 
Indian's plight because "we must 
speak for those who can't for 
themselves. ~ (Q]

1987 NCAA Division III World 
erie , started out at 0-3, 0 the 

powerful tar! thi season could 
be a sign of what to expect from 
this year' team. 

Triton Jim Martinez broke a 
2-2 tie in the bottom of the sixth 
inning with a 2-run inside-the-
park homerun. leading UCSDto 
an eventual 5-2 win over the 
Crusaders at Olsen Field . 

Dave Adamson went seven 
inni ngs fort he Tritons. giving up 
only four hits to pick up hi fir t 
win of the ea on and Kyle 
Abbot! put on the fini hing 
touches to earn his firs t ave. 

Henry Jimenez helped out with 
the offense. going three for four 
on the afternoon hitting a triple 
and two doubles for one RBI 
and stealing home. Gary Fessia 
added a double , a single and a 
RBI. 

Larry Johnson (0-3) went all 
nine innings to take the loss for 
Point Lorna (0-9) . 

Dave Adamson gave up only four hits against Pomona to earn his first victory of the season 

The Tritons attempt to con-
tinue their success with a road

History 
at Sushi Idris Aekamoor and Rhodcssa Jones will appear in "Trilo!(y Noire / Winter Tales," 

at Sushi . 

by jean maguire 
hiatus intern 

C oping with the tragedy of AIDS, living the colorful life of a jazz 
mUSICIan, and a young man 
returning to the United States 
after serving in Vietnam are 
among the many situations 
and characters that are 
encountered in an evening with 
the San Francisco-based Cul-
tural Odyssey's production 
"Trilogy Noire / Winter 
Tales." Three solo artists, 
Rhodessa Jones, ldris Acka-
moor and Charles Lester, work 
in a variety of dis iplines 
including acting, dancing, and 
singin~, to create an int~grated 
program. Their program will 
premier.:' Friday and Saturday, 
Feb, 26 and 27 at 8 pm at th~ 
Sushi Gdl~ry in celebration of 
Black History Month. 

Jones' work is entitled "The 
Nappy Reality; Growing up in 
America!" In it, she creates a 
diverse cast of characters, from 
a talk show hostess to a love 
sick young woman living in 
Soweto, South Africa, Jones 
uses dance, comedy, music 
and drama to bring her cre-
ations to life and to examine 
different aspects of a black 
woman's experiences through 
those creations, 

The third show is Lcst~r's 
"Tast~ of Honey" which deals 
with the odyssey of a Vietnam 

veteran. It begins with a 2t 
year-old boy returning from 
Saigon to Northern Califor-
nia, unsure; of his place in 
society. "Honey" concludes 
20 years later, the boy is now 
an unemployed, homeless, 
disenfranchised man in San 
Francisco. Lester combi nes 
theater, music and song to 
explore the difficulties still 
facing the men and women 
who were in Vietnam. 

Ackamoor's performance 
centers around his talents as a 
musician. His main instrument 
is the alto saxaphone, but he 
also plays tenor sax, keyboards 
and a variety of synthesizers 
and percussions. The piece, 
"An American Griot/ The Life 
of a Jazz Musician" conj ures 
up the memory and music of 
past jazz greats, Ackamoor uses 
stories, dance, and, or course, 
music, to explore the ups and 

. downs in the life of jazz saxo-
phonists. The design of the ' 
show is "new performance 
style," meaning it incorpor-
ates both traditional and ex-
perimental aspects of theater , 

Cultural Odessey is a self-
described "Multi-media per-
formance ensemble" founded 
eight years ago by Ackamoor. 
He and Jones are the current 
artistic directors of the group 
which has performed its own 
creations of mixed media 
shows throu!(h the United 
States and Europe, Their 

works tend to deal with po-
litical and historical themes 
but also draw heavily from the 
popular culture. 

As Jones has asserted , 
"We're definitely not doing 
what's traditionally expected 
of black performers," They 
also go beyond the traditional 
expectations of theatrical ex-
perience with these interdis-
ciplinary solo works. 

Ackamoor is a composer, 

in addition to his other talents. 
He is currently Artist-in-Resi-
dence for the California Arts 
Council, as is Jones, and has 
received fellowships in jazz 
performance and composition 
three times from the National 
Endowment of the Arts. Les-
ter has been involved in Bay 
Area theater for t7 years, 
including a performance in 
the West Coast premiere of 
Sam Shepard's "Tooth of 

rime."

Whose 
CORPSE 

is it? 
by nancy rnuntner 

hiatus writer 

Everyone likes a good mys-
tery. Especially one where you 
try to figure out 'who-done-it' 
before you are told the answer. 
The interesting - and capti-
vating - difference in Gerald 
Moon's comedy thriller, 
"Corpse!," is that rather than 
trying to deduct who done it, 
you attempt to discern who it 

' PRICES INCLUDE: 
graphic cut, shampoo, 
conditioning and 
professional styling 

was done to. 
The story is set in London, 

1936, and it revolves around 
three central characters . First, 
the re is Evelyn Farrant, a poor 
out of work actor who lives in 
a basement apartment in Soho. 
Then there is Rupert Farrant, 
Evelyn's rich twin brother who 
lives in a large house in Re-
gent's Park. Finally, there is 
Major Ambrose Powell, an 
Irishman on the run from 
some thugs who he crossed in 
the past. 

Early on we lea rn that 
Evelyn, a concei ted and some-
what insane man, wants his 
brother dead . He has chosen 
the M ajor to do the job. An 
elaborate plan is devised, and 
Rupert is shot - or is he? This 
is the central question of the 
play and it becomes hard to 
discern who is alive and who is 
a corpse. 

Mike Timoney, as Evelyn 
and Rupert, docs a superb job 
of changing back and forth 
between cha racters. He plays 
equally well the mad Evelyn 
and the ca lm, restrained 
Rupert. Also, he is ab le to 
constantly amaze the audience, 
for as you think he's lying 
dead at one part of the stage,

Funny 
issues? 

by mark kenney 
hiatul writer 

Eleven amateur comedians 
gave stand-up their best shot 
this past Monday night at the 
College Comedy Competition. 
They stood in the limelight for 
a few minutes each, in an 
attempt to convince the crowd 
in the Pub and the judges alike 
that they were the funniest 
students alive. 

It was not an easy job. The 
bright spotlight stopped the 
comedia ns from actually 
seeing the audience, an audi -
ence which was not always 
forgiving. They were always 
ready to hurl bags of Doritos 
at performers or mention , 
without an excess of tact, when 
they thought an act had gone 
on too long. Even Steven 
Heitner, the profeSSional co-
median who emceed the show, 
was not completely safe from 
heckling. 

As master of ceremonies, 
Heitner was very funny, al-

you might think the parts were 
being played by two people. 
Ron Richards, as the thor-
oughly confus ed Major, 
played his part expertly as 
well . Cora lie Schatz, in a small 
part as Evelyn'S landlady, was 
also very good. 

The set design of the play

"The Gulf, 1988" is a collection of black and white 
photography by graduate student Moyra F. Davey o n 
exhibit this week at UCSD's Mandeville Annex Gallery. 

Daveys' technical and creative talent is particularly per-
ceived through a piece consisting of a row of portraits-
each visage a haunting image of mysterious pain and 
unknown sufferi ng. The glazed eyes resemble those of 
tortured concentration camp victims. The portraits are 
opposite a row of four large images of distorted toes and 
feet which further emphasizes the vulnerability of the 
seemingly imprisoned subjects. 

The show will run through Friday , Feb. 26, with the 
closing party that day from 6 to 9 pm.
