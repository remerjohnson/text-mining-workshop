Stand 'up to Coop Factions" 
Andy Schneider said Wednesday 

that he is planning to "take on" the 
Marxist Caucus, which played a 
decisive role Monday night in 
denying Schneider a new tenn as 
External Affairs coordinator of the 
Student Cooperative Union. 

Schneider-who served as 
External Affairs Coordinator over 
the summer-said in an interview ' 
" It's time someone took on the 
factions dividing the Coop." 

The vote for the External Affairs 
Support Group Coordinatorship 
Monday was Â·15 for Ron Bee to 14 
for Schneider, WIth 15 a6slentfonS. 
Since no candidate received a 
majority of the voters present, a 
new vote will be held at next 
Monday's Coop meeting. 

AboUtionist Movement 

feel the council is . both 
tu;lrepresentative of the UC student 
body and overly establishment-
oriented. 

Schneider, while conceding 
SBPC should be more responsive to 
stUdents, said, "a move to abolish 
the council will destroy everything 
San Diego has worked to achieve. 
Our relationship with SBPC has 
provided increased information 
from UC and the Student Lobby 
and expanding participation with 
thestate Legislature." 

~hneider also pQinted to the 
council's recent decision to en-
dorse plaMing funding for Third 
College, Step 2, which was rejected 

. by the Legislature and Gov. J;lrown 
for this .year's budget.

Univers.ity Scientists Hit DNA 
. . . 

Research at City Board Meeting 
by Joel C. Don 

Associate News Editor 
Strong opposition to the current 

escalation of recombinant DNA 
experimentation was voiced by two 
prominent scientists Wednesday at 
a meeting of the DNA Study 
Committee of the Quality of Life 
Board for the city of San Diego. 

The committee is currently 
investigating risks in gene trans--
:plantation experiments and the 
possible environmental impact on 
the San Diego community. In order 
to fully understand potential 
dangers, the committee solicited 
the advice of qualified opponents to 
the research. Due to the virtual 
lack 'Of opposition within the UCSD 
community, scientists from the 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology (MI'l') and San Diego 
State University (SDSU) were 
asked to present their opinions and 
evaluations of the safety and 
potential hazards in genetics 
engineering technology. 

In an address to the DNA Study 
Committee conducted over 
telephone, Jonathan King, 
chairman of the Department of 
Microbiology at MIT, stated that 
there arerlt any experiments in-
volving the transfer of genes at the 
present time which could obviate 
all fears of an environmental 
hazard. He insisted that all 
reseal'th present aathort!ed fur 
university labs should be moved 
into centralized facilities. 

California Expansion 
King's remarks directed 

themselves at the California in-
stitutions of UCLA, UCSF, .stan-

ford, Caltech and UCSD, where 
biohazard containment facilities 
for the expansion of recombinant 
DNA research are either being 
proposed or are under con-
struction. In the case of UCSD, the 
fourth floor of the Medical 
Teaching Facility, currently under 
construction, will be modified to 
include a biohazard containment 
facility for recombinant genetics 
and viral cancer research. 

According to King, the problem 
of utilizing a different ex-
perimental organism other than E . 
coli, which thrives in man's lower 
intestine, lies in the fact that new 
organisms will be even more 
unpredictable due to the lack of 
known properties. The extensively 
studied E .coli bacterium, with 
most of its properties understood, 
poses a threat to man if a toxin-
producing or a carcinogenic strain 
somehow managed to escape the 
confines of the containment facility 
and subsequently survive outside 
of its laboratory environment. 

The chance of a laboratory error 
is not impossible , as King noted 
that there have been 50 cases in the 
history of molecular genetics 
where biological infections have 
occurred. 

When asked whether recom-
binant DNA research should only 
remain a scientific issue, King 
ouUtfle'd tlte role of the city com-
mittee in preparation for the new 
UCSD facility. King's recom-
mendations included: 

-the Biohazards Committee (at 
UCSD) should be representative of 
all the people associated with the 

containment facility; including lab 
assistants, dishwashers and junior 
faculty. 

-medical procedures should be 
set up before the facility is built, in 
order to cope with any emergency 
situation. 

-the university should not be the 
sole agency assessing the dangers 
of the research. 
. Who Doe It Benefit? 

King concluded with a conunent 
on the benefits of the research, 
indicating that the people in favor 

Adela Boer 

of immediate proliferation suggest 
the purpose is to increase our 
knowledge and realize potential 
advantages for mankind. 

The great number of abstentions 
-which were primarily by Marxist 
Caucus members-came after both 
Schneider and Bee refused to 
endorse the abolition of the Student 
Body Presidents' Council (SBPC). 
(While the Marxist Caucus has not 
officially endorsed abolishing 
SBPC, several of its members are 
known to support such a move.) 

Free Schools Offer Downhome Education 
" I have yet to hear of any 

benefits that have any sense of 
reality ," King said, and he added 
that " very few people other than 
those that want to do the research 
claim the great benefits." 

Schneider said he originally was 
going to resign, because the 
situation in the Coop had become 
" unworkable." In a prepared 
statement, Schneider, who has 
been an ardent Coo(H1efender in 
the past weeks, said: 

" Several members of the 
External Affairs SuPPOrt Group 
felt the Coop had become un-
workable and that the time had 
come to indignantly boycott a 
slanted process. But we have 
decided as a group to stay and 
fight. To withdraw now would be to 
concede 'central government to the 
influence .of a single special in-
terest group. To boycott would 
allow an elite group of radicals to 
rule by default. .. 

Schneider said Marxist Caucus 
members are "working to the 
detriment of the Coop." 
Additionally, he said that caucus 
members are trying to use the 
Coop as a platform for a single 
viewpoint. 

In the same statement, 
Schneider said "student govern-
ment should reflect the views of aU 
students and respond to campUl 
conunuf\ity need. A lovemance 
tructure created and paid for by 

studerts should not be UHd for the 
advancement of a singular 
politicalideolOlY." . 

Cruo.C..nkt 
The crux of the confUct between 

Schneider and the Marxilt CaucUl 
seems to be whether the Coop 
hould endone the aboUtion of the 

SBPC. Supporters of the position 

by Jeff Sorenson 
(CPS)-With courses like 

"Raising Catfish in a Barrel" 
and "Be Good to Your Back" 
the nation's 200 free universities 
provide classes that most 
colleges would not dream of 
offering. 

Every year hundreds of 
thousands of people enroll at 
free universities, which offer 
classes without the burden of 
grades and credit. These 
alternative schools specialize in 
unorthodox subjects that 
traditional universities ignore. 

"What we're doing is getting 
back to the oldest, most bastc 
type of education, where in-
structors 'are people who want 
to teach anq students are people 
who want to learn," explained a 
spokeswoman for the 
Experimental College ' in 
SeatUe, Washington. "We're 
trying to get away from the 
preoccupation with teaching 
certificates and degrees and 
moving towards learning for 
enjoyment." 

No Degree 
Free university courses are 

Lmually taught in the homes of 
teachers, who are paid little or 
nothin8 for their work. The 
instructors generally aren't 
required to have a teaching 
certificate or even a college 
degree. 

Students are attracted by 
"the informaUty, the shortness 
~ the clules and because the 
price is rieht," said Sandy 
Bremer of the Open Univenity 
in Wuhinglon DC. ' 

Staff workers at free 
lUIiversitiel report that the 

classes usually cost between $5 
and $15, although some are 
priced at $100 and a few cost 
nothing. 

Most free university students 
are young-between 25 and 40-
single, professional people with 
college degrees, according to 
Bremer. The majority have 
some background in academic 
classes so they come to a free 
university looking for 
something different.. Seminars 
on yoga and sexuality are 

. particularly popular with this 
group, she noted. 

Other free university staffers 
report that classes on astrolo~y. 
meditation, personal problems, 
women 's stucues, health and 
arts and crafts are well at-
tended . Instructors are 
generally free to select any 
subject for classes--from 
traditional literature to witch-

craft, flute making or gar-
dening. 

"Communlty-Oriented 
Programs" 

"Free universities have 
moved from a campus 
phenomenon to a community-
oriented adult education 
program, " explained Bill 
Draves, coordinator of the Free 
University Network. He added 
that although free universities 
are commonly considered as 
dying remnants of the sixties, 
the free university movement is 
actually stronger now than 
ever. 

"There may have been ~OO 
free universities about five 
years ago, but many of those 
were sporadic," Draves said. 
"Today's free universities are 
stronger and offer more classe 
to more people."

.---- J 

Adela Baer, a geneticist from 
SDSU, came to' the committee 
meeting with her personal opinions 
and the general feelings of the 
biology professors at SDSY. 

Baer asserted that the public 
should be concerned about the 
safety of the research, the 
relationship of recombinant DNA 
research to public needs and 
societal goals, and more im-
portantly, i>ublic accessibility to 
science and information about the 
specific work being conducted in 
the university . 

Containment and safety are the 
primary concerns among the 
community, and Baer noted that 
she favors the strict regulation of 
all P3 and P4 researcn, Pol being 
the highest degree of risk . 

" I urge for the pre nt that 
governmental regulations be 
drawn up to include inspection of 
P3 and P4 facilities with ap-
propriate penalties for non-
compliance," Baer stated and 
further suggested that this work 
should be confined to one or two 
facilities in the country. 

" The public need not weigh this 
inconvenience to scientists very 
heavily," Baer continued, "after

work."

Several Modest Propaull 
to Increase Voter 'I'Ill'llOat 

The most important issue of the current presidential campaign is not 
u.,employment, inflation or the lust in Jimmy Carter's heart. It 's voter 
turnout. National pollsters predict that the turnout of eligible voters this 
year will fall below 50 percent fOl' the first time in 5% years. 

Whatever the cause-and it's probably a combination of things-a 
solution is needed. A low turnout rate indicates real alienation among the 
people. But, how to increase turnout? 

One way would be to make voting compulsory. Several cOWltries now 
have this system. In Australia, oitizeIW who fail to vote are fined. Italians 
who miss election day gain a "no&voter" stamp on their identification 
cards. . 

You can gueu the turnout rates tD thotIe countries. 
Of course, compulIory voting is probably unconstitutional. But, then, 

that ain't neceaarily 10. AI the Supreme Court has pointed out on several 
occasions, the Constitution is whatever five of the nine court Justices rule 
itto be. 

A more constttutionally-palatable proposition would be automatic voter 
registration. Both Great Britain and West Germany have such systems, 
and turnout in the two countries hovers at 80 percent. But, automatic 
registration won't get people to the poll!!. 

Another way to increase turnout rests at the opposite end from com-
pulsory voting-a drastic restriction of suffrage. Say, limit the vote to 
wh.ite males, over 30 years of age, who own a certain amount o~ property. 
ThIS would doubtless increase turnout, because such people vote more 
often than most others anyway. 

It would also lead to revolution and class-warfare in the streets. (And, it 
would be one surefire way to put together the longo(:herished coalition of 
students and workers.) It doesn't matter that less than half the eligible 
voters use The Power. Just as long as the option remains ... just in case it 
ever seems worth it. Oh, but take the vote away and hear hue and cry. 

But, no, restricted suffrage wou1dn't make it. White male landowners 
have enough power already. While the ballot box may not be the most 
effective m ethod of reform, It has great potential, if used correctly , with 
organization and discipline. 

That's how politics were organized in the late 19th century , during the 
heyday of party politics and boss rule in the citi,es. Torchlight parades, 
brass bands and fiery oration to stir the voters , to involve them in a 
fraternal felling with the party, to make them want to vote. 

And tha t 's another way to increase turnout today. Turnout for 
presidential elections in the 19th century was about 80 percent, far above 
today's average. What might be needed today is a return to yesterday's 
politica l tactics. 

But a return to the politics of parade-band-an<k>ration may not be 
possible with the jaded citizenry oC the the seventies. Today's voter might 
not be able to lose himself in t he emotion oC a parade, lit by smoking 
torch, that snakes through the dark streets toward a great ora tor, who 
stands ready to whip the troops into a partisan frenzy. 

The problem is, orators sufficient to the task may not exist anymore. 
Today's politiCians, who have campaigned solely through media image in 

rec~t years, may no longer have the talent to excite the masses by voice 
alone. A presidel)tial campaign between orators today would have to be 
between Ronald Reagan and Daniel Patrick Moyniha n . 

It'd be worth a try, though, if just for the fun of it. But television would 
have to be abandoned. Emotional rallies televised to the nation just 
wouldn't be the same thing as the live event. TV is too impersonal. While 
it might be a good medium for convincing people how they should vote, it 
has never been proven to increase turnout at all. For example, this year's 
debates should increase the turnout, if TV was at all effective Cor that 
purpose. But the forecast remains below 50 percent. 

So the rallies would have to be live, not televised to the nation. But the 
substance of the speeches doesn't really matter. No one listens a nyway. 
As long as they are fiery and emotional, they 're fine. 

However , this proposal might' not be acceptable .either. 19th century 
strategies were abandoned when city polit iCS were reformed in the early 
twentieth century. And why were city politics reformed? Because of the 
amazing amount of corruption they bred. 

A return to 19th century politics would inevitably m ean a return to that 
corruption. , 

It seems no scheme for increasing turnout is fool proof. The best way-
perhaps the only real way-to get more people to the polls is to have more 
attractive candidates. This step, combined with an ~utomatic 
registration system, is probably tlie best-and most modest- proposal to 
increase voter turnout.

One, Vote N1akes a Difference 
The coming elections seem to be 

the occuion fi a g~. collective 
yawn here on camp\18 in stark 
contraat to years past when 
students and faculty were the 
movers and shakers in national 
political campaigns. 

Lots of eXplanations for the 
current aPathy are bandied about; 
e.g. that the present college 
generation is â¢ 'silent and Job 
oriented," or that there is no dif-
ference between the candidates, or 
that a vote makes no difference. 

These are absurd reasons. " Job 
oriented" people should vote for 
the party that will create the best 
environment for employment in 
science , humanities and the arts, 
as well as for society's. neglected 
who are 80 easily forgotten in this 
pampered environment. . 

People who know such as the 
Sierra Club, the NAACP, Ralph 
Nader and Common Cause 
disagree with the contention that 
there is no difference between the 
candidates. This rumor is only an 
excuse for laziness. 

A single vote CAN make a dif-
ference in a swing state such as 
California. A little volunteer work 
can make even more . 

It's easy to say that this election 
won 't matter. Perhaps it won't to 
us a cademic aristocrats. 
(Althoug h our government's 
present nuclear proliferation at-

Utucle may end everyone, rich and 
poor alike) . But it does matter to 
thole overseas who are tortured by 
govenments our present ad-
ministration props up, to the 
unemployed hl!'re at home and to 
those who have to deal with an ever 

. increasing tangle in the Fe4eral 
bureaucracy . It matters to the 
Farmworkers and to those who 
fea r for our fragile envlroninent. 
. For our part, we-are going to be 

available during the next two 
weeks to answer questions about 
Democratic candidates. Just look 
for our table or come to our rally on 

Wedneaday, October 'Z1 for detailed 
answers to your questions. 

Meanwhile, it is hoped that this 
letter will start a debate on the 
pages of the Triton Times in the 
remaining days before Nov. 2. 
We'll start it off by saying that it's 
time for a chanRe!

documented evidence from the Ft. 
Detrick facility, where 423 cases of 

. infection and three deaths have 
occurred over some 25 years in this 
P4 arrtiy biological warfare lab. 
She mentioned that it was a 
"serious oversight on the part of 
the National Institutes fi Health 
that such accident figures were not 
pubUcized." . 

Baer concluded by favoring 
stricter gUidelines and regulatiolW 
for recombinant DNA research 
and for major public participation 
"at all levell in fonnulating and 
implementing legislation and 
regulations of hybrid DNA 
research." 

One of the concerns expressed by 
the committee was the lack of 
information on other institutions in 
the country cUrrently involved in 
recombinant research. The Senate 
Subcommittee on Health has also 
admitted to confusion over the 

number of P3 and P4 facilities in 
the country. 

Clifford Grobstein, vice-
chancellor of university relations 
at UCSD, stated that there are six 
to eight researchers involved in 
recombinant DNA research at 

U~D, and confinned the in-
forma tion on the facillties at 
UCLA, UCSF, Stanford and 
Caltech. Grobstein attended the 
meeting to clarify some confusion 
over the construction of a new 
biologicallaborstory in the Kearny 
Mesa area. 

Grobstein assw-ed the c0m-
mittee that the Balboa facillty will 
not be involved in recombinant 
DNA research. 

The DNA Study Committee plans 
to hold fts next meeting in 
November and will solicit the 
opinion of an outspoken proponent 
of recombinant technology in order 
to complement Wednesday's

Mandeville 
Gallery's 
"Star Time" 

by Debbie SChwartz 
After the 1960's, when all 

systems by which we deal with 
ourselves, others, and the en-
virorunent came Wlder critical 
examInation and accepted 
definitions and values were 
questioned, negated, and often 
replaced, we are left with a 
tremendous amount of freedom in . 
the creation of our own individual 
lifestyles and attitudes . Con-
temporary art is proceeding to 
establish mqre privacy and liberty 
in artistic and intellectual exÂ· 
pression through a conscious 
analysis of weaknessesÂ· inherent in 
accepted ideas about art and 
society. 

The exhibit currently on display 
at the Mandeville Art Gallery by 
Alexis Smith, _ an established 
conceptual artist, is representative 
of this new attitude. ' The exhibit, 
entitled " Star Material, " 
establishes its fonn through the 
interchanging of visual and 
literary symbols. Although the 
works are obviously not examples 
of conceptual art in its purest form, 
since they do exist in the physical 
realm, the primary concern here is 
to present ideas. 

The artist renders form to her 
ideas through scrapbook or collage 
images accompanied by written 
statements and, in some cases, 
framed in succession to depict 
progression of time. The show 
examines . concepts of myth, 
symbols, and illusions through the 
direc,t use of them in a refreshirigly 
simple and amusing manner. 

Smith also plays with the idea

(CPS) The latest salvo has been 
fired in the ever-escalating battle 
of Beatiemania, and the current 
weapons are TÂ·shirts. 

A Boulder, Colorado firm, The 
. BeatJes Reunion Foundation 

(BRF ), anned with oodles of op-
timism and a novel gimmick, is the 
latest entry into the worldwide 
struggle to bring the four lads back 
on the same stage on the same 
night. 

Of course, the BeaUes haven't 
kicked out the jams together for 
nearly 10 years, and in fact they've 
even come out and said they . 
haven't the least hankering to do 
so, but that isn't stopping the BRF 
gang from pouring $70,000 and two 
years of toil into the project. 
â¢ " It can happen!," assures the 

BRF newspaper ad that asks 
readers to send $5 plus $.75 postage 
for the honor of sporting a red, 
white and blue " It can happen" T-
shirt and a numbered membership 
card. The shirt entitles the bea'rer 
to a chance to be one of the 10,000 
chosen ones to attend the live 
concert, although the chances of 
that happening are slim since the 
BRF hopes to enlist seven million 
subscriptions. 

The TÂ·shirt 68le, which will go 
into high gear in: Los Angeles in 
several weeks, will supposedly 

provide the necessary cash 
sound equipmentIor rented 
seven U.S. cities.

It's an intricate plan, but

"The chance of the concert 
in a million," says BRF 
Mike Karzon, a former 
of Colorado student . "But 
look at it the other way," 
" ItÂ·s one out of two. Either

cost you $4 .50," says BRF 
organizer Robert Galinsky from 
the fOWldation's office, a room 
crammed with Beatie posters and 
other memorabilia. 

The BRF is hardly alone in its 
efforts to get the' Beatles back 
together. Some people close to the 
scene say over 100 promoters in 
every part of the world have 
hatched various schemes to 
reunite the fbur . One group is 
selling "Let It Be" bumper 
stickers to encourage the gig while 
the Beatie's own record company 
reports receiving blank checks 
from around the world along with 
instructions telling the' firm to 
simply fill in the proper amoWlt 

. should the Beatles ever do another 
concert. Several versions of Beatle 
conventions and multiÂ·media 
shows have also been staged in 
severa l cities. 

One of the farther out attempts 
at getting the message across was 
New York promoter Sid Bern-
stein's recent full page ads in The 
New York Times and the loterÂ· 
national Herald Tribune. Bern-
stein, the man who put on the first 
U.S. Beatle show in 1964, offered 
$200 million and said "a world 
living in fear of tomorrow's tragic 
headlines needs a symbol of hope 
for the future . " 

One of these ads was shown to 
Beatie Ringo Starr while he was 
lunching in his posh Paris hotel 
room recently. His_response was 
characteristic of his three fonner 
cohorts ' responses over the years. 
Ringo refused to even read, the ad, 
saying it contained too many words 
for his taste.

Station To 
With all the money the E;agles 

must be making, you would think 
that they could dress a little bit 
more extravagantly. These guys 
probably think a football jersey is 
formal. But then what do you 
expect from an American band. 

The trouble is the Eagles are 
Wldoubtedly the top band America 
has to offer in the rock and roll 
sweepstakes. No on~ else really 
comes close. Hear that, Robert 
Hilburn? Not the Allman Brothers 
(they're defunct), not The Band 
(they might as well quit) and not 
the Rolling 'fhunder Revue (their 
singer is off-key). And with the 
release of the new Hotel California 
LP the Eagles will continue to soar 
to greater heights. 

As the Eagles kicked off their 
national tour. last week in San 
Diego, it was evident that the 
addition of guitarist Joe Walsh 

triton times 

Station 

gave the band a harder rock sound. Glenn Frey 
Watching Walsh and Don Felder 
playing side by side conjured up 
images of Keith Richard and 
Ronnie Wood jamming together 
(6ut with a distinct Stateside flavor ). The Eagles needed Walsh to 

provide a balance. "Lyin' Eyes" and "Best Of My Love" moved me to 
tears, but without a foot stomper like " Rocky Mountain Way" the concert 
could have become stale. 

Meanwhile, the band's two main hotdogs, Glenn Frey and Don Felder, 
remain as steady and'cool as eve â¢. As musicians, they are no better than 
mediocre. But their vocal prowess sells the band. 

It had been three years since I had last seen the Eagles perform in 
concert, yet the show's format remained distinctly similar. They always . 
open with "Take It Easy" and close with " Best Of My Love." They play 

THE EAGLES 
more from the Despel'Jldo LP than you would think they would. The 
staging remains distinctly lowÂ·key, . with no flash powder, billowing 
smoke,laser lights or fire-breathing. . 

The primary reason for the Eagles' success though, is that they are so -
fucking consistent. With each album' the group has shown steijdy imÂ· 
provement while keeping the same sound and identity. Hotel California is 
a continuation of that steadiness. 

The Eagles continue to sell plenty of records. And that's with an image 
of long hair, beards, Levis and tennis shoes. Who knows, with a little 
mascara ... 

â¢ â¢ â¢ Paul' McCartney and Wings' recent benefit concert for the sagging city 
of Venice drew 25,000 people to St. Mark's Square and raised $50,000. The 
latest issue of Rolling Stone reports that the concert also made the Square 
sag a little more. A couple of paving stones collapsed under the weight of 
ttie crowd and water seeped through. 

â¢ â¢ â¢ In the Brittsh Isles, a Scottish member of parliament called on the 
government to ban the Ramones song " Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue. " 
The Scotland Evening Times said selling the recOrd suggested the 
Ramones record label, Sire,' ' is so interested in making a fast buck that it 
doesn't accept any social respOnsibilities."
