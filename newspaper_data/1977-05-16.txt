by Mark Stadler 
Managing Editor 

Muir College junior Jeff Leifer, 
who was instrumental in the drive 
to bring the Associated Student 
form of government back to UCSD, 
was elected 1977-78 ASUCSD 
president by a two-to-one margin 
in last week's voting. 

Leifer tallied 651 votes, or 65.1 
percent, to his opponent Steve 
Grady's 349 in . the voting last 
Wednesday and Friday. The 

turnout of UCSD undergraduates 
was approximately 12.5 percent. 

In the vice-presidential 
race, Muir junior Mark Sindler 
captured 53.8 percent of the votes 
for a narrow victory over Pauline 
Breeden. 

Laura Kerl,another Muir junior, 
was elected Commissioner of 
Academic Affairs in an equally 
close race, beating Brad Drexler 
by 53 percent to 47 percent. 

Revelle freshman James 
Lofgren gained the Commissioner 
of Appointments and Evaluations 
position, receiving 60 percent to 
Stephen Jason's 40 percent. 

Loretta Dority, running unop-
posed, was elected Commissioner 
of Elections.

Ancient Memorial Blocks Freeway 

The remains of an ancient Indian memorial have clashed with the 
construction of a modern American superhighway. So far, the lndian 
memorial has triumphed. _ 

The bones of two red-tailed hawks, entombed in a small pyramid of 
three rocks as a memorial to a Luiseno Indian chief who died 20().6()() 
years ago, lie in the proposed path of Interstate 15 north of Escondido 
and east of San Marcos. 

The Luiseno Indians are supposed to tell the California trans-
portation Department Saturday whether the $22 million freeway 
should be rerouted to miss the memorial, which is protected by federal 
law from destruction. 

The memorial is the only evidence ever found of the rite known as 
the eagle ceremony, according to a Caltrans archeologist. 

Padres, City Reach Full Count . 
It was just a couple of weeks ago when the San Diego City Council 

was ready to approve new repayment terms for its loan to the San 
Diego Padres. Then the Padres' President Buzzie Bavasi asked the 
City to help pay for both freebie tickets given to area youth groups and 
the cost of cleaning the stadium, and to pay for complimentary tickets 
city officials receive. 

Since the new demands were made two weeks ago, the council has 
postponed consideration of new loan repayment tenns for two weeks, 
at which time the city attorney will present a report on the possibility 
of the city charging the Padres for /all municipal services extended to 
the team. . 

Three weeks ago, the council tentatively approved the new loan 
plan, which gives the Padres ten years to repay the loan of $2.1 million. 
Under the current repayment plan the city gets 50 cents for every 
ticket the team sells over 800,000 in a season. 

The city OWJlS the stadium. 

Mandatory TA Training Asked 
'SACRAMENTO - Teacher training should be mandatory for all new 

teaching assistants at the University of California .. according to the 
UC Student Lobby. 

The Lobby made this and other recommendations in a recent letter 
to Academic Vice President Donald Swain. Swain is investigatL'lg 
better ways to train teaching assistants at the university. 

Bret Hewitt, ' co-director of the Lobby, said, "We feel the recom-
mendations are comprehensive and are sensitive to the needs of TAs 
and undergraduate students, as well as to the university." 

Vice president Swain said he is not yet prepared to comment on the 
Lobby's proposals: But William Fretter, chair of the Academic 
Assembly, said he thought they are "very constructive." ~ 

"I didn't find anything lacking in their recommendations," Fretter 
said. "There are some organizational details to work over, but I think 
their recommendations are quite reasonable." 

The Lobby recommended that each campus have a teaching 
assistant training advisory committee to oversee training programs. 
The Graduate Dean would be responsible for the programs and a 
training director would handle the administrative duties. 

Bunn Suit to Remain in Closet 

who will be the first ASUCSD 
president since 1971, said Saturday 
his first priorities will be to assess 
student needs to set an agenda for 
the new government, and to make 
sure qualified students are found to 
sit on campus-wide committees. 

Leifer, who was reached in the 
Academic Senate office where he 
was studying for three midterms 
this week, also said the ASUCSD 
must "prioritize funding 
allocations which are responsive to 
student needs and create new 
avenues for student input both to 
the government and the ad-
ministration. " 

In addition to electing the four 
ASUCSD executive officers, 
students also voted last week for 
college representatives to the 

ASUcSD and for new college 
goverrunent officers. 

As of Sunday, only Muir and 
Fourth Colleges had released 
results for the ASUCSD council 
positions, with defeated 
presidential candidate Andy 
Schneider and Anita Vittor elected. 
The third Muir seat will be ap-
pointed by the Muir College 
Council. 

The Fourth council members are 
Reddy Biggs, Janet Bills and Mark 
Wilson. 

The Third College Council has 
tentatively appointed Mike 
Estrada, Jonathon Osborn and 
Gracie Zavala as its represen-
tatives. 

The Revelle election results will 
be released early this week. 

Alumni and Friends Push Issue 

Jeff Leifer 

Koala Proposed as New Mascot 
by Wesley Wada 

Staff Writer 
In an effort to generate en-

thusiasm, the Alumni and Friends, 
UC San Diego, have proposed that 
the nickname of the campus be 
changed from ' the Triton to the 
Koala. 

"The Triton is sadly lacking," 
bemoaned Tom Shepard, 
University Extension Counselor 
and Alumni President, "It is an 
insipid, meaningless symbol." 

The idea for the Koala- emblem 

originated, according to Shepard, 
from "a few members of the 
Alumni and Friends." The 
members felt that there were 
many good reasons for adopting 
the Koala as UCSD's mascot. The 
members believed that "the bear 
is the symbol for the UC s" 
referring to the "Golden Bears" of 
Berkeley and the "Bruins" of 
UCLA. They feel that UCSD is 
"Out of the mainstream" by not 
being represented by a bear figure. 

Adds Shepard, "The San Diego ' 

A San Diego Zoo koala hides his head in dejection because the Elections 
Sub·committee refused to allow the question of whether the koala should 
replace the triton as campus mascot. 

Zoo has the only Koala bears 
outside of Australia. They also 
have a human sized Koala bear 
suit which someone can wear." It 
is Shepard's hope to convince the 
San Diego Zoo to designate one of 
its Koalas the UCSD Koala. 

In response, the San Diego Zoo 
Public Relations Department 
expressed "doubt" as to whether 
they would agree to this 
suggestion. One of the possible 
problems the Zoo mentioned was 
that a Koala's life span is ap-
proximately ten years, and ' UCSD 
will be here a lot longer than a 
Koala. Replacing the designated 
Koala could produce awkward 
situations. "

ASUCSD officers. 

McElroy: Student TA Ratio nNot Critical" to Education 

The training sessions will begin 
this afternoon at 1:00 in the Student 
Center with an organizational 
development session held by 
assistant student affairs vice-
chancellor Tom Brown. Brown will 
talk on the group process, the 
importance of communication, the 
organization of meetings and the 
delegation of responsibility ,--

Tomorrow's session, set for 10:00 
am to 1:00 pm in the International 
Center, will focus on goal-setting. 
Student Organizations Advisor 
Joann Ritchie will speak on the 
philosophy and concept of if 
government. In addition, the new 
offlct~r will attempt to set up a list 
of general goals and objectives for 
the Af,UCSD. 

by Joel C. Don 
Associate News Editor 

While asserting that he is 
unhappy with the declining 
number of teaching assistants at 
UCSD, Chancellor McElroy said 
Friday that the total number of 
TAs in the student's education is 
not critical, and he suggested that 
the faculty might have to work 
"work a little more." 

In the first of a series of Infonnal 
gatherings with students, McElroy 
fielded questions from a group of 15 
on issues ranging from minority 
recruitment to Third College's 
Academic Unit II and the tenure 
process. 

McElroy's next meeting with 
students is scheduled for tomorrow 
at noon with Muir students in the 
Chancellor's office. 

In Friday's meeting, McElroy 
announced that state approval of 
the Third College's Academic Unit 
n Facility is "going along fine in 
Sacramento," and that both 
planning and construction of the 
facility could begin this year. 

The facility, to be buUt adjacent 
to the completed Academic Unit I, 
will eventually house Third College 
programs such as Urban and Rural 
Studies and the Provost's office, as 
well as provide additional 
classroom space. 

"Interact With Students" 
Regarding TAs, the Chancellor 

said that while additional funds 
have been allocated to "take up the 
slack," the most important 
educational experience "is going to 
come from interacting with you 
fellow students, discussing ideas 
and learning how to use the facts ." 
He added, "The fa cult)" can only 
guide you in that." 

On the question of class size, 
McElroy said: "It's certainly true 
the lower division classes are 
fairly big lasses, but if you've got 
an adequate classroom and good 
teachers, evidence indicates that it 
makes no difference. 

"It would be nice if you could 
have a class size of 15 from the 
freshman year through, but that's 
economically impossible," he 
added. 

When asked about the student 
complaint of good teachers, who 
may not be good researchers, 
being denieG tenure McElroy noted 
that the .criteria for promotion is 
based on scholarship, teaching and 
public service, each considcred 
"very r~ously" in the tenure 
process. 

Noting surveys made at Cornell 
University. where researchers 
were voted the best teachers, he

from someone with very familiar

couldn't afford to let his true

showed them the illustrious Triton 
Times style book, (which he 
always kept with him,) and helped 
get them jobs on the local rag-The

only natural that those two would

Dear Dr. Lltdeman, 
" U Nixon [McElroy) thinks I can 

belp out on an Interim basis tben 
I'm pleased to bave the op-
portunity," HIIDt said. 

According to Hunt, He and Nixon 
established two conditions before 
be accepted the Interim post. The 
first condItion was that HIIDt DOt be 
a candidate for the permanent 
position. The second was that Hunt 
had the President'. [Cbaacellor's] 
1" percent backing for all 
decisions he will have to make. 

Triton Times, Friday, AprU 29,

Is It true that this article was 
plagiarized from a several year old 
copy of the Washington POIt, and If 
50, how did tbis particular [E.] 
Howard Hunt get a job here? 

Please understand that I do not 
wish to Imply any similarities 
between Chancellor McElroy aad 

The similarity between the 
writing styles is not that 
astonishing. In the Triton Times' 
third year of publication, 1969-1970, 
we had as our News editor Roger 
Showley. Roger had already made 
his mark on the campus as the 
driving force behind the short-lived 
publication the Trident, which 
proclaimed itself to be a new kind 
of yearbook providing a 
photographic-literary history of 
UCSD for the '70s. When Rog 
graduated in June, 1970, he became 
director of a coUege news service 
for the Republican National 
Committee in Washington. He was 
also the first (and only) 
Washington bureau chief the 
Triton Times has ever had. While 
in Washington, R.S. met a couple of 

As to how Our Man Hunt got a job 
here, I checked with three campus 
employees named Mitchell, 
Agnew, and Ford, and they were 
all in agreement that they didn 't 
know. However, according to an 
anonymous athletic director here, 
Hunt was hired because he has nice 
legs. 

Dear Doc: Why do good looking 
men Insist on hiding thel.r faces 
behind all that hair, namely 
beards? Bearded men all look the 
same-mediocre. Signed, Fuzzy 
Wuzzy's FrieDd [be hael {'to hair 
but be was a real cool dude.] 

Beards are a sign of. insecurity-it 
gives men something they think 
they can hide behind. My advice to 
you is to sneak a razor into bed 
with you the next time you and 
your man decide to tickle each 
other's fancy. Then , when he falls
