voted 362-293 against Marshall ProV()M cell 
Lytle \ proposal for an on campus charter school 

The assembly defeateu a motion for a calll-
puswide faculty mail ballot on the report by a 
20-43 vote. One more vote would have man-
dated the mail ballot. 

Proponents of the mail vote aid that it was 
necessary to receive input from Jhe faculty. 
However, opponents of the proposal said that 
sufficient time had elapsed for the faculty to 
add their input to the proposal. 

Dynes said he was plea ed that the 
Academic Senate approved the report . 

"I am delighted that we can continue to 
move forward with this bold initiative to build 
upon existing outreach efforts and increase 
UCSD's role in the academic preparation of 
students in our community," Dynes said. 

The UCSD K-12 Outreach Task Force pre-
sented its report in early September after 
numerous summer meetings. The report call s 
for a multi-faceted plan to expand outreach pro-
grams in the community in order to increase 
diversity at UCSD. The plan includes the cre-
ation of a model chool and the expansion of 
existing outreach programs.

Interfraternity Council Expels Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity 
GREEKS: Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon 
fraternity suspended 
By ErIka Snider 
Staff Writer 

The IntcrfraternilY Council 
(IFC) Judicial Board ruled la~t 
Sunday to remove the Delta Sigma 
Phi fraternity from the [Fe. 

According to the ruling, the 
Delta Sigma Phi fraternity did not 
abide by the fFC's constitution 

and it failed to encourage interfra-
ternity spirit among its members 
and a spirit of cooperation with the 
university and the city of San 
Diego when it was involved in a 
violent incident with the Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon fraternity on Nov. 
14. 

After the incident, the seven 
other fraternities in the IFC filed 
grievances with the IFC's Judicial 
Committee against the two fraterni-
ties. These grievances led to the 
committee's investigation of the 

incident anu the judicial board's 
eventual ruling. 

Delta Sigma Phi i~ no longer 
considered a student organi7.ation. 
The fraternity cannot reapply for 
membership to the IFC until winter 
1999. 

The IFC Judicial Board's ruling 
stated the hope that the fraternity 
will use this period of expUlsion for 
"interfraternal relations improve-
ment." Additionally, the hoard stat-
ed that il believes the sanction 
imposed is one of "leniency to 

allow the Delta Sigma Phi 
Fraternity to address its numerous 
problems." 

The decision, which was 
announced at last wcck's meeting of 
the [FC President'S Council, can be 
appealed by the fratcrnity to the IFC 
Executive Board. The executive 
board consists of the presidcnt and 
vicc prcsiuents of the IFC member 
fraternities.

Humanitarians Gather for 
Discussion on Homelessness 
HELP: UCSD hosts 
forum on"Hunger in 
the Global Village" 
By Quyen Tu 
Staff Writer 

Representatives from SI. 
Vincent De Paul Village. World 
Share and Project Concern 
International gathered for an infor-
mal discussion entitled "Hunger in 
the Global Village" lasl Monday at 
the Pepper Canyon Lodge 

Mall Packard, a represent:ui ve 
of SI. Vincent De Paul Village, told 
the audience what he envisions as 
the purpose of the organization. 

"SI. Vincent de Paul Village is a 
rehabilitation center for the home-
les ' built on self help," Packard 
said . "The continuum of care and 
services are deSigned to provide 
available opportunity (for people] 
to become sclf uflicienl." 

Packard aid the vil lage hou~es 
about 900 people each night and 
offers a variety of servlce~ such as 
medical care and counseling to its 
inhabitant . 

Elisa Sabatini , who coordinates 
the intemational aspect of World 
Share. said her organization is an 
offshoot of SI. Vincent De Paul 
Village with the addition of an 
international focus. 

"Self Help and Resource 
Exchange was founded by people 
with support from SI. Vincent de 
Paul," Sabatini said. "We expanded 
into Mexico in 1983 with uppon 
from the United States Depanment 
of Agriculture."

Dynes said he is excited because 
approval of the repon permits him 
to begin fundraising for the project. 

''[' m going to go out and start 
raising money - as much as I 
can," Dynes said. 

According to Dynes. the multi-
faceted report allows for a lot of flex-
ibility on the part of the university.

When tbe funding from the gov-
ernment became insufficienl . 
Sabatini said World Share turned to 
local suppon to continue it pro-
gram in Mexico. 

"Activities in Mexico are based 
on a loan program to local fann-
ers," Sabatini said. " It actually gen-
erates enough income from the 
interest and management of those 
funds to pay our cost." 

"Making change now. investing 
resources now, .i~ going to make the 
difference in the long run and not be 
a drain on the tall dollar," he saKI. 

Packard said that charitable pro-
grams that give aid to the homeless 
are benelicial to society, not a drain 
on taxes. 

"People graduate our program and 
they are tax payers:' Packard said.

Packard said he 
believes organiza-
tions that are dedi-
cated to helping 
people get back on 
their fcet arc 
essential to alleVI-
ating the homeless 
prohlcm. 

"Project Concern International 
focus on improving the health of 
communities in the countries where 
we work," said David Coono. a rep-
resentati ve of the group. 

The organizalion itself has gone 
through three stages of transfornla-
tion . In the beginning, Project 
Concern International focused on 
directly providing services to peo-
ple. It then shi fled to prevention by 
educating people. Currently. the pro-
ject is teaching other organizations 
how to provide the necessary aid. 

Packard stressed his belief that 
it is important to invest money into 
fighting the homeless problem. 

"We need a broad menu of solu-
tions because different people have 
different needs," Dynes said. 

According to Dynes the plan 
will allow the university to divert 
resources from programs that are 
not working to ones that are. 

"We will have in place a set of 
appraisals," Dynes said. "If they're 
not meeting what the goals are, 
we' ll squeeze them down and use 
the resources someplace else." 

In October, Dynes assembled the 
UCSD Pre-Planning Action Team -

tools need to hi: there. avai lable to 
them to be able to get their lives 
back together," Packard said . "If 
they are not , it can be a recidivistic," 

Sabat i ni said she believes that 
consumerist behaviors. encouraged 
by the current economic system, 
contribute to the problem of home-
Icssness. 

"People are poor not because they 
arc stupid." Sabatini said. "People 
arc poor because of a system of [eco-
nomics] that doesn't work." 

Packard added that he believes 
society is very reluctant to accept 
the problems of homelessness as 
one of its responsibilities. 

for the implementation of the repon. 
The team of 14 faculty members 

is ellpected to present its recom-
mendations in December. 

Sociology Professor Hugh 
Mehan, who was a member of the 
task force and is now on the action 
team, said he is glad Dynes appoint-
ed the action team before the 
Academic Senate approved the plan. 

"We've got a running start," 
Mehan said "It was very clever of the 
chancellor to have this action team go 
simultaneously with this vote because 
we are three months ahead."

PINI N 
re OS erous 

In order to bring a hasty end to many of 
society'S most pervasive and nagging 
problems, our writer has 'a few surprising 
propositions for California's next election 
By Simone Santini 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

So Proposition 209 was upheld by the Supreme Court after all. Barring any 
unlikely events like a sudden wave of sanity sweeping the country, it is now offi-
cial that· we should not try to make up for de facto discrimination. 

Proposition 209 is the worthy conclusion of a wonderful trilogy that includes 
Proposition '184 (which made California the only place in the world where one 
can serve life in prison for violently stealing three slices of pizza) and 
Proposit ion I 7 (which pushes one to criminality because one's parents immi-
grated illega lly in order to give one an alternative to criminality). 

After these three propositions. I am convinced that Californians will pass just 
about every nutty idea put on the ballot. 

Monday, December I, 1997 

Becau e of this, and as a guest in thi s state, J ha ve 
decided to give my humble contribution by suggesting 
to the benevolent attention of the Californian voter a 
few' propositior.s that [ believe would go very well with 
the aforementior,ed triplet. I am sure that among these 
propositions, eve,y voter will find that particular one 
that speaks to his or her conservative heart. The numer-
ation I give to the propositions is, of course, arbitrary. 
Definillve ones will have to be ass igned before going to 
the ballots. 

Proposition 226: Inclusion' of 
liberalism In'the list of 

Proposition 221: Creation of the S.E.A. 
The State Endowment for the Arts (S.E.A.) will 

replace the ational Endowment for the Arts (NEA) for 
funding California art . Its goal will be to promote true 
art. unjustly penalized by those lefties in Washington. [t 
will promote healthy and wbolesome forms of expres-
sion, like paintings of dogs playing poker, elevator 
music, action movies and the X-Files. 
Proposition 222: EliminatIon of teenage crIme. 

According to this resolution, the number thirteen to 
nineteen will be replaced with the numbers thirshort to 
nineshort . As the "teen" numbers cease to exist, so will 
teenagers and, therefore, teenage crime. There might, 
of course, be the mounting problem of shortage crime, 
but that doesn't sound as bad. 

Note also that teen pregnancies will be transformed 

recognized diseases 
Liberalism will be declared a 
pathology. Symptoms will ~e 
defined as an unhealthy 
concern for the disadvantaged, 
a unwholesome Interest In the 
problems of society as a 
whole, a worrisome tendency 
to analyze problems rationally 
rather than relying on 
emotional and sensationalistic 
arguments, an altogether 
exorbitant dose of tolerance, 
and an excessive amount of 
culture. 

into short pregnlmcies, with evident savings in heaith care e~penses for the tax-
payer. Teen sex will become short sex. Some teens might not like. this, but 
churches will be delighted. 
Proposition 224: Health care reform (California Style) 

We will deal with health care just [ike we deal with all other social problems. 
This proposition will make it illegal for anybody without a sufficient income to 
get sick. Violators will be prosecuted and sent to jail, and their children will be 
thrown out of public schools. A "three strokes and you're out" provision will be 
enforced. 

For those people who still insist on being sick, their treatment plan will model 
the very efficient and successful American judicial system. 

Whenever you are sick, instead of consulting a doctor you will go out in the 
street, gather a group of people at random, accurately eliminate everybody who 
has even the faintest knowledge of medicine, as well as those equipped with an 
!Jnhealthy dose of common sense, until you have reduced the number to [2. Then 
you e1tplain your symptoms in a way that goes from baffling all the way to utter-
[y incomprehensible, and let them formulate a diagnosis. 
Proposition 221: TV reform 

TV prognms will be censored with respect to se1t and violence; but mostly

COMMENTARY: Amidst harsh and frequent accusations of shockingly bad press, a Guardian Greek-sympathizer makes a 
peace offering to UCSD's fraternity and sorority members with the age-old plea, "Can't we all just get along?" 

GUARDIAN OFFERS CEASE-FIRE TO GREEK SYSTEM 
By Jonah Freedman 
Senior Staff Wnter 

I've heard it all before - it 
seems to be a feud comparable to 
that of the Montag ues and the 
Capulets, and it is just as much of a 
mIsunderstanding. It IS the UCSO 
Greek system vs. The UCSD 
Guardian, and it's the battle royale 
of the decade. 

There is a common misconcep-
tion out there that makes me sad. 
According to conventional wis-
dom, the Guardiall has it out for the 
Greek sys tem - and the Greek 
system hates the Guardian because 
any press it gets is bad press. 

With the Guardian's Nov. 21 
front-page story detailing the 
Panhellenic Council 's social-{!vent 
boycott of two fraternities, more fuel 
has been added to the fire. That hav-
ing been said. it is my intention to 
make sense out of the whole thing. 

I'm in an awkward position. I'm 
not in a fraternity and I am not 
going to join one. However, a good 
portion of my friends are represen-
tatives of UCSO's fraternities and 
sororities. These friendships mean 
the world to me. At the same time, 
though, I'm the co-managing editor 
of the Guardian. A conflict of inter-
est? Maybe. But I don't want it to 
be that way. 

I want everyone to realize that 
the Guardian is not out to get the 
Greek system. The Guardian is 
merely here to serve the UCSO 

community - and that includes 
fraternities and sororities. 

It's a common belief that tradi-
tionally, the Guardian has never 
done a whole hell of a lot to promote 
the Greek system. While this idea 
may hold some water, I'm going to 
have to defend my turf and point out 
that the Guardian has done its part 
to keep things under control. 

First things first. about this busi-
ness concerning the altercation 
between the Sigma Alpha Epsilon 
and Delta Sigma Phi fraternities -
many members of the Greek com-
munity arc upset over the afore-
mentioned front-page Guardian 
coverage, headlined "Frats Face 
Criticism." They claim that univer-
sity affiliates who oppose the Greek 
system and continue to criticize it 
will have more grounds to do so. 

Well . I've got news for you -
nothing that gets put in the 
Guardian, good or bad, is going to 
make a difference. Those who hate 
the Greek system will go on believ-
ing what they want to believe, like 
it or not. Stereotypes will continue 
to e~ist, even if they might not 
come into play on this campus. 

The article was extremely taste-
ful. It took no slanted angle, criti-
cized no one and read like a text-
book news article - what journal-
ism is supposed to be. Those who 
are angry that the article ran, that's 
too bad. As a newspaper, it is the 
Guardian's duty to report the news,

Well, I've got news 
for you - nothing 
that gets put In the 
Guardian, good or 
bad, Is going to 
make a difference. 
Those who hate the 
Greek system will 
go on believing what 
they want to 
believe, like It or 
not. 
to mediate it to the community. 
That's what the Guardian did. 

Let's look at it another way. The 
article was not written from an 
angle that suggested, "Those crazy 
frats, there they go again." On the 
contrary, the article gave the Greek 
system enormous respect - it 
showed that the Greek system is 

FIND 

Can

lStudent Center

General Store. 

willing and able to discipline and 
police itself in an adult fashion . 

Kudos to the Panhellenic 
Council (which chose to ban the two 
fraternities from any sorority activi-
ties for one year) for making a quick 
and effective decision on the matter. 
By dealing with the issue, the Greek 
system showed that its members 
have acquired the leadership skills 
their chapters have taught them, 
skills that will help them in their 
post-graduate years - that i what 
the Guardian documented. 

So far this school year, the 
Greek system has received some of 
the best press in the pages of this 
public,ltion than it has in years. Not 
evcn a month ago, Pi Kappa Alpha 
members Darren Gretler and Tony 
Fiori appeared on the Guardian's 
Nov. 3 front page in photographs of 
Pike's chartering banquet in 
Coronado. This event was extreme-
ly important to the Pike fraternity, 
and was crucial e~posure for the 
Greek system as a whole. 

On Nov. 17, a Guardian news 
article documented the annual AII-
Greek Philanthropy event, the truest 
expression of the good that the 
Greek system provides the commu-
nity. Two hundred Greeks from 10 
fraternities and sororities bagged 
lunches for the homeless, promot-
ing community outreach and unity 
for the entire university community. 

Both of these features were 
tremendously good press for the 

Greek system. Nowhere would you 
have found a sweeping genera[iza-
tion about fraternities or sororities; 
not a single clich~ anywhere -
nothing about hazing, drinking, 
vandalism or any other stereotypi-
cally Greek activity notoriou Iy 
publicized at other schools. 

I mUSl also point out that in last 
spring 's April 7 A.S. election issue, 
the Guardian wholeheartedly put 
its support behind the largely-
Greek Revolution platform. 
endorsing two current officehold-
ers. A.S. President Souley Diallo 
(of Sigma Phi Ep ilon) and Fiori. 
vice president of finance. 

As for later Guardian criticism 
that came about - especially 
directed at Diallo - I can't point 
any fingers; that wouldn't be fair. 
Diallo faces crilicism every day; 
not just in the pages of the 
Guardian, but elsewhere as well. 
He and Fiori are public figures. 
They are not scapegoats represent-
ing the Greek system; they are 
elected representatives of the stu-
dent body - and they have 
extremely demanding jobs. 

The Guardian does not have it 
out for the UCSO Greek system. 
While [ can't say that people don't 
have preconceived notions, I will 
say this - it is the Guardian's job to 
remain unbiased. That is the basic 
underlying principle of any newspa-
per. The Guardian will continue to

Bashing Connerly 
Hides Writer's Fear 
Editor: 

There IS fear In Grace Jang \ 
t'Ol11 mentary on Ward Con nerly 
(' 'Why UC Regent Ward onnerly 
1\ an Idiot," Nov 20. 1997). The 
fear IS nol of oppressive "social 
nCI\\orJ-s." nor of loonllng "reseg-
regalloll ." Il(H evcll of Ihe 10" of 
race- and gender-based personal 
prIVileges. Had these been her con-
l'crn~. MS Jang need not have 
dwelled so obsessIvely on Mr. 
Cannerly's race and on the suppos-

edly inescapable nature of group 
identities. 

What terrifies Ms. Jang is that 
the day might come when, inspired 
by Mr. Connerly's exam ple, people 
wi ll tinally look beyond their own 
and one another's group member-
Ship 

On that day, II will no longer be 
automatically assumed that soc ial 

aCllvls t ~ who arc black speak for 
blacks, those who are ASian speak 
for Asians, and tho e who are

Connerly IS a sycophant, we are 
told, because he bowed and scraped 
hi S way into the white-male estab-
lishment. 

Connerly IS a liar for not admit-
ling that it wa this craven behavior 
- and not any ki nd of hard work or 
perseverance - that led to hiS suc-
cess. 

Connerly is an Uncle Tom. 
because when he entered the corri-
dors of white power he betrayed his

own people by perpetuating the 
myth of individualism - the insid-
ious, "selfish" idea that people can 
only and should only succeed 
based on their own hard work: and 
uncompromising standards. 

Connerly is also an idiot because 
surely only an idiot would oppose 
quotas and preferences for women 
and non -whites. Needless to say, 
none of these characterization s 
even remotel y resembles a coherent 
argument for quotas and prefer-
ences based on gender and race . 

When Ms. lang finally ge ts 
around to her argument for prefer-
ential policies, she premises it on 
the notion that there are no such 
things as indIvidua ls - onl y 
groups to which each person 
belongs. Even if one accepts this 
idea, it docs not im mediately fol -
low that affirmative act ion should 
be Implemented to make sure there 
IS proportiona l representation for 
all groups. 

Whites are the majority in thiS 
country. yet you don 't see the affir-
mative action crowd clamoring for 
preferences for white in the NBA. 
Why not? Because it IS a non 
sequitur to say that the color of 
one's skin has anything to do with 
whether one is talented enough to 
play in the NBA . 

By parity of reasoning, whether 
one is white, black or Asian has 
nothing to do with one's qualifica-

tions as a teacher of, say, quantum 
physics. Instead of seeking to make 
race and gender irrelevant in our 
society, Ms. Jang would have race 
and gender infect every nook: and 
cranny of American life, a situation 
the vast majority of people outside 
of the ivory tower would consider 
with disgust. 

Understandably, Ms. Jang and 
the proponents of the racia l and 
gender preferences that she repre-
sents are upset that the voters of 
Cali fo rnia voted down their vision 
of the world, which holds that 
women and minorities are under· 
represented in certain occupations 
only because of discrimtnallon b~ 
whIte male~ . 

California ns recoglll zt: thaI 
many other factors are responsible 
for a lack of minority representa 
tion 111 certain areas . For example, 
crime, drugs and a dysfunctional 
fa mily structure resulting 111 out-of-
wedlock birth rates exceeding 50 
percent have a profound impact on 
the education and development of 
inner-city youth, thus limiting their 
fu ture chances of success in Ii fe . 

II is onl y when Ms. Jang and her 
ilk stop the name-calli ng tantruOls 
and start acknowledging that these 
issues - and not the issue of race 
are the most pressing social prob-
lems of our time that meaningful 
social progress can be made.

sex. 

While a healthy dose of vio-
lence is necessary to forge young 
minds into real Americans, kids 
must be absolutely protected from 
the dangerous knowledge of the 
names and aspects of certain parts 
of the human body. They might 
decide that the whole sex thing is 
more fun than shooting each other, 
with evident disastrous social con-
sequences. 

Whene ver a character in a 
movie pronounces the name of a 
forbidden part of the body, the 
voice will be loudly "beeped" over, 
or dubbed in a very obvious way, 
so that the parents wi ll know that 
we are taking care of the moral 
tiber of their children . Exposure of 
parts of the body of dubious 1110ral-
ity will, of course, be forbidden . 

Morally questionable movies 
wi ll be heavi ly censored but aired 
anyway for the sake of business. To

Liberalism will be declared a

rather than relying on emotional

altogether exorbitant dose of toler-

To those members of the

can't tolerate criticism without

CRISIS: 
Campus has few 
reported rapes 
Continued from pac. 1 
identity of the victim will remain 
undisclosed because of the nature 
of the crime. The suspect's identity 
is currently unreleased due to his 
status as a minor. 

According to Jones, UCSD his-
torically, has had remarkably few 
reported rapes . However, he also 
said that these stati~tics cannot be 
relied on to paint thc whole picture 
of how many sexual assault~ are 
occurring. 

"On onc hand. it'~ good that our 
numbers are so low. Within the 
UCs, our reported numher~ arc 
among the I()we~ t - only 19 
reported rapes on-campu!> in thl.: 
past 22 ycars ," Jonc ~ loaid. "Are 
those numhcrs reprc~entati vc of 
what is really going on out thcre'! 
Of course hot. " 

This incident , the second report -
ed rape on campus this calendar 
year, is exceptional due to the fact 
that the police were notified imme-
diately. 

According to Nancy Wahlig of 
thc UCSD Student Safety 
Awareness Program (SSAP), only 
about I in evcry 10 rapes is rcport-
ed to the police. 

Wahlig said that this tendency to 
stay silent, especially among vic-
tims of rape by a known assailant. 
accounts for the significant di s-
crepancy between thc actual num-
ber of rapes that are commilled in 
this country each year and thc num-
ber of rapes that are representcd by 
police statistics.

Jones said that although he 
understands that there are reasons 
why victims often chose not to 
report rapes to the police, he 
believes that keeping silent does 
not allow for justice to be done. 

"I respect the right and decision 
for women not to come forth . There 
are a multitude of issues surround-
ing that decision - parents. 
school, reputation, mayllc protect-

. ing someone they know," Jones 
said. "However, from my perspec-
tive as a law enforcement official . 
not coming forward and reporting 
rape. a felony. reinforce~ bad 
hchavior," 

Wahlig also said that it is impor-
tant for a victim to tell their story 
either to the police in the pursuit of 
J uMice or to someone else as a step 
in the healing process. 

"Reporting tu the police is ju~t 
one option," Wahlig ~aid . 
"Speaking of what has happened to 
you - to a counselor. or to a friend 
- is also a way of healing. 

"As much as I would like peo-
ple to report crimes to the police, 
sometimes that is just nOl the place 
to go. So, , want people to know 
there are other options in trying to 
overcome this traumatic experi-
ence," she added. 

According to Wahlig, rapes in 
which the victim Imows his or her 
allacker arc clouded with a variety 
of emotional issues and complica-
tions. and that is why not reporting 
persists as a trend among victims. 

"It's such a big step to call and 
report to the police," Wahlig said. 
"Maybe [the victims] don't want to 
get in trouble , maybe they're get-
ting pressure from a variety of peo-
ple to not go forward, or maybe

they stan questioning themselves. 
'Did' give mixed messages '!' ... 
There are a lot of reasons why peo-
ple may not feel comfortable going 
to the police about a rape with a 
known assailant." 

Wahlig also said that although 
she believes education efforts have 
improved general knowledge of 
what constitutes rape. educalOr~ 
have yet to innuence more victims 
into reporting thc crime to police 
and pursuing justice for their 
allackers. 

"So often, 1 will talk to students 
in counseling situations who will 
say ' I said no,' 'My 'no' wa. 
ignored,' '1 fought but the individ-
ual was much bigger than me.' or 'I 
wasn't sure what was happening. I 
was intoxicated,' or 'Someone put 
something into my drink ' ... They 
often know how to define what 
happened to them as rape," Wahlig 
said. "In one sense, the education is 
out there, but most of the rapes are 
still not being reported to the 
police. 

"Recent estimates say that only 
about I in 10 rapes are reported; 
that was a statistic used in the early 
'80s and it's still being used today, 
although education about the issue 
of rape has increased," Wahlig 
added. 

Wahlig said that some of the 
hesitancy to go to law enforcement 
officials could be the fault of inac-
curate popular myths about what 
the police investigation process is 
like.

ideas from old movies, which don't 
indicate what the police really do in

CRISIS: Beware 
of date rape drug at 
parties 
ContInued from pa •• 8 
lege-age women do need to take 
extra precautions to keep them-
selves safe. She said that the threat 
of drugs like Rohypnol, 
"the date-rape drug," first docu-
mented in the United States in 
1993, necessitates that women stay 
especially alert in party situalions. 

"I know the popularity [of 
Rohypnol] seems to be increasing," 
Wahlig said. "I've had about five 
women who have come forward in 
probably the lasltwo years and, as 
they have described it, what hap-
pened to them sounds as if they had 
something put into their drink. 

"Some have heen in orange 
juice, some havc been in an alco-
holic beverage. There are drugs oul 
there. Wherever you arc, it's really 
important that you take precau-
tions," she added. 

Both the SSAP office and the 
Women 's Center provide informa-
tion on precautions women can 
take to prolect themsclves from 
threats like Rohypnol, as well as 
information about prolecling them-
selves from rape and sexual assauli 
in gcneral. 

Wahlig said thai kecping oncself 
safe does not necessitate paranoia 
or the elimination of fun . 

"There's a lot of prevention that 
doesn ' t prohibit us from making 
friends, or that doesn't prohibit us 
from dating someone," Wahlig 
said. "I truly believe it gets back to 
trusting your instinct and acting on 
it. 

"Sometimes people hear that lit-
tle voice but they tell themselves 
'Oh, I'm just being too silly, too 
paranoid.' They convince them -
selves that because a person is at a 
house, at a certain party, they mUM 
have been invited, and therefore 
can be trusted, and they ignore the 
feeling that they shouldn ' t trust 
them:' Wahlig added . "Get tilal 
person's phone numher, connec t 
with them later." 

Wahlig said that gelling infor· 
malion can ~imply come down to 
communICating wllh Ihe per_on 
you arc With. 

"Jf somebody c rosse~ a line, or a 
siluallon feels uncomfortable, ask 
questions - 'What did you mean 
by thatT or 'Does going up to your 
bedroom mean that we're going to 
have sex?'" Wahlig said. "I -know 
it's hard to ask these questions; but 
somehow find the words and ask 
the other person what Ihey mean." 

Wahlig recently teamed up with 
Lupe Samaniego-Krauss, Director 
of Health Education at Student 
Health Services. and drafted a pro-
posal for an "Alcohol and Other 
Drugs, and Violence Prevention" 
grant. The two-and-a-half-year 
grant has been approved, and SSAP 
will be funded for additional sexu-
al assault-education and prevention 
programs. 

"Hopefully we will be able to 
change existing norms and behav-
iors here, on campus, through thai 
grant." she said.

a victim of sexual assault, a variety 
of resources are available to you on

The 
Editor's 
Soapbox 
Jessyca Wallace 
Associate Opinion Editor 
VISUal Arts Asks, 
Wbere's the Cash? 

As many regular readers of 
th is rag can attest, r typically bag 
on the university. its policies, its 
procedures and its altitudes. 
Today, in keeping with my semi-
historic tradition of criticism, r 
vociferously claim that the uni-
versity is failing to distribute its 
funds equally among the academ-
ic departments - especially to 
the visual arts department. 

r would like to note that the 
reason this column is even 
appearing is because the 
Academic Senate, in its infinite 
wisdom, has made it impossible 
for someone not directly involved 
with the enate to come to a meet-
mg and vOice hi S or her concerns 
- even the regcnts gi ve "white-
hne" prIVi leges. 

I understand Ihat 1 have an 
undergraduate representative to 
the Academic Senate, David 
Freeman. the Associated Students 
Commissioner of Academic 
Affairs, but it is not Freeman's 
responsibility iO field questions 
about the lack of funding for the 
departmenl. 

There is th is strange phenome-
non at this school that goes a lit-
tle so mething like this - the 
biology department gets the most 
money from research grants and 
other sources, so the universilY 
also gives it the most money. 

Similarly, the visual arts 
department gets vcry little money 
from sources outSide the UfliverSI -
ty and so, in its infinite wisdom, 
the university gives that depart· 
ment vcry lillie money as wcll. 

Hmmmmmmm. 
It seems to me that rewarding 

those who solicit funds from elsc-
where is a tad redundant. 
Likewise, punishing the depart-
ments that don't seek financial 
assistance from outsiders is like 
biting off one's nose to spite 
one's face - it leaves one with a 
sour taste in the mouth. 

The university has a responsi-
bility to be sure that all of its stu-
dents are getting the best educa-
tion it can give us. To provide 
this, the university needs to fund 
every department so that all the 
equipment needed to teach stu-
dents works . 

An example of this within the 
visual arts department is Ihe color 
processor in the photography lab. 
This piece of equipment - essen-
tial to creating color photographs 
cfficiently - does all the devel-
oping that a photographer would 
do in a color lab in aboul 45 sec-
onds. 

For approximatel y three weeks 
the processor has been down -
in other words, it is brokcn to a 
point where no one working for 
the department knows how to fix 
il.

tioned about when it will get 
around to fixing it - seeing as it 
has already wasted almost one-
third of the quarter for students in

PART TWO OF A TWO-PART STORY ON EQ!)AL ACCESS 

GUARDIAN EDITOR SPENDS A WEEK IN A WHEELCHAIRAND 
FINDS THAT LIFE AT UCSD IS LESS THAN ACCOMODATING 

recently spent a week in a wheelchair, zipping 
around campus like I would any other week. I 
visited nearly every major building, from the 
Price Center to Urey Hall, and recorded my 
observations. I've passed them on to Barry 
Niman, chair of UCSD's Americans with 
Disabilities Act Advisory Committee, and 

I've listed some of the most striking 
moments below. 

The wheelchair I used was provided courtesy of 
the Access Centcr of San Diego. Established in 
1976, the centcr helps people with disabilities take 
control of their own livcs and integrate fully into 
mainstream socicty. 

The center provides information and referral 
services, advocacy for clients who are struggling 
with government bureaucracies, housing and per-
sonal assistant referrals, and peer counseling. 

The Access Center also operates the Spoke 
Shop, which rents, sells and repairs all sorts of 

wheelchairs and other forms of durable medical 
equipment. 

"The right piece of equipment can make a 
tremendous difference in your life," said Spoke 
Shop Manager Brian Reeder. "If you're using a 
chair, that chair becomes your legs." 

According to Reeder, wheelchairs cost any-
where from $350 for simple models to more than 
$20,000 for the most sophisticated power chairs. 

I'd like to thank Roberta Gimblett of the Office 
for Students with Disabilities, Barry Niman of the 
ADA Advisory Committee, Brian Reeder of the 
Spoke Shop and the countless number of kind-
hearted souls who held doors open, gave me a 
push, helped me oul of tight spots or even just 
smiled at me as 1 passed by. 

Being in a wheelchair means different things to 
different people: some would like the rest of the 
world to pretend that the chair doesn't exist, while

others want all the help they can 
get. 

I fell somewhere between the 
two extremes: I maneuvered 
around campus the best I could, 
taking creative shortcuts through 
buildings and elevators wherever 
possible, but there were times 
when I was tired and frustrated 
and really appreciated a helping 
hand. 

SUNDAY, 1 P.M. 
After cruising around the 

Guardian offices a couple of times. 
I think I'm ready for the real 
world. I can roll forward and 
backward, turn in circles and, 
most importanlly, come to a stop. 
How tough can this be? 

The anslVer comes jive seconds 
laler when I hit Ihe doorsill and 
nearly kill myself on the way oul of 
the office. I pull the seat bell a lit-
lie tighter and get my second 
shock a minute later when the ele-
\'alOr door nearly chops my arm 
off. This is going to be a. long 

week. 
My goal in spending a week in 

a wheelchair was twofold: to see 
just how accessible the campus is 
(not very), and to experience the 
world from a different perspective. 
I found that while I could get any-
where I needed to go, it wasn't 
always going to be easy. 
Sometimes, it was a real pain in 
the ass. 

Most people don't think much 
as they walk across campus, plant-
ing one foot firmly in front of the 
other until they reach their desti-
nation. In the wheelchair, I was 
constantly pushing like crazy or 
braking like mad. I didn't actually 
nip the chair or do any major dam-
age to my body, despite multiple 
warnings that I would kill myself 
by the end of the first day. 

SUNDAY, 5 P,M, 
Cruising around Ih e Geisel 

Library is relatively easy and 
problem-free, but I' ve come to the 
conclusion that wheelchair users 
here need 10 know for, for in 
advance when nature is going to 
call. Each floor of the library has 
at least two bathrooms, but not a 
single one in the tower is wheel-
chair accessible.

that I would kill 
myself by the end

I could (barely) maneuver 
through the hallway into the bath-
room itself, but there was no way 
short of levitation that I could get 
into the stall. I couldn't even fit the 

chair through the door to the 
eighth-floor men's room (a one-
person affair about the size of my 
broom closet). 

University Librarian Gerald 
Lowell said he wants to ensure 
accessibility, but that the lack of 
available funds limits what he can 
do. 

"Whenever you have facilities 
constructed pre-ADA, you then 
face the constant struggle of how 
much to upgrade, at what cost and 
for what benefit?" Lowell said. 
"The reality is that I can't make 
every stack accessible to people in 
wheelchairs." 

The libraries weren't all bad-
several terminals throughout the 
library, as well as the reference 
desk, were at a sitting height. The 
terminals on the higher floors, 
however, as well as the main infor-
mation and circulation desks, were 
all at a standing height. 

Lowell said that anyone need-
ing help in the library should ask 
at the circulation desk, and that he 
would look into lowering the ter-
minals.

the introductory class and upper-
division classes as well - it 
responds that there is no money 
available for repairs at this time. 

WHAT?! NO MONEY?! How 
is that even conceivable? Doesn't 
the department have a repair 
fund? Well, no, it doesn '(. The 
reason the department doesn't 
have a repair fund is that there 
isn't enough money to begin with 
- much less enough to set up 
some sort of savings plan. 

Sadly, the effects of poor fund-
ing in the visual arts department 
don't end there - they pervade 
everywhere. 

Currently, the department 
offers approximately 10 upper-
division studio classes per quarter 
in performance, painting, draw-
ing and sculpting. This wouldn't 
seem like much of a problem, 
except that time and space allow 
for up to 24 classes per quarter. 
Additionally, many of those 
classes that are offered are over-
crowded or conflict with other 
courses within the department. 

Recently, my painting profes-
sor, Ernest Silva, came into our 
class asking for our perceptions 
of how the department could be 
made better, as a committee had 
been developed to revamp the 
studio curriculum of the depart-
ment. 

Since the lack of classes has 
been a bone of contention for me 
for quite some time, [ told 
Professor Silva about the need for 
more classes. His response was 
that there are so few courses 
offered because there isn't 
enough money in the department. 

If every student in the depart-
ment pays his or her tuition and 
respective lab fees, why isn't 
there enough money? 

Offering more classes would 
decrease class size, increasing the 
instructor-student dialogue time 
dramatically. This is something 
that is crucial to an education in 
studio art and it would offer stu-
dents a greater choice of profes-
so rs as sometimes students don't 
work well with particular profes-
sors. Additionally, it would 
resolve time conflicts between 
courses. 

The university should not be 
comfortable allocating so little 
funding for the visual arts depart-
ment that the department can't 
even offer enough classes - this 
isn't San Diego State University. 

In addition to not offering 
enough classes, some classes that 
are offered are underfunded 
which decreases the quality of the 
education students receive. 

A prime example of this is the 
Beginning Drawing (VIS I05A ) 
course which I and 29 other stu-
dents took. 

My professor for this class, 
Faith Ringgold , felt we would 
benefit from spending much of 
the quarter working from live 
model in class, in addition to our 
anatomy and creative assign-
ments at home. 

A studio class meets 20 times 
per quarter. The department had 
enough money to fund 12 model-
ing sessions for our class. Guess 
who paid for the rest? The lItU-
dents in the class. Hadn't we 
already paid our tuition?

WHEELS: 
'Disability' attracts 
unwanted attention 
Continued from pa,. 12 
chair lifts in Center Hall seems to 
be working - the second is shut off 
and the third is stuck halfway up 
with the door jammed open, some-
thing I didn 't think was possible. 

There are several wheelchair 
lifts scattered around campus in 
locations where neither an elevator 
nor a ramp would be practical. 
Unfortunately, the lifts are out of 
commission more often than not. 

Although Gimblett said the 
campus Building Services depart-
ment is responsible for unlocking 
the lifts in the morning and secur-
ing them at night, Building 
Services Manager John Stevenson 
said the department takes more of a 
hands-off approach. 

"The arrangement is to leave the 
keys in the lifts at all times," 
Stevenson said. "None of our folks 
lock or unlock them, but we do 
secure the regular [outside) doors 
in the evening and unlock them in 
the morning." 

The problem with leaving keys 
in the locks is that people tend to 
take them or break them off, which 
is exactly what happened with all 
three lifts in Center Hall. Stevenson 
has since discussed the issue with 
Cara Fladd, scheduling coordinator 
in the registrar's office. 

''The ultimate goal is that the 
lifts should be on all the time, 
whether the classrooms are open or 
not," F1add said. 

The lift outside the campus 
counsel and sexual harassment pol-
icy and prevention offices has, as 
far as I can tell, sat locked and 
unused for at least the last month.

Monday, December I, 1997 

UCSD's residence halls, apart-
ments and reslcuuanlS are 10 peo-
ple in wheelchairs. NOl very, I'm 
willing to bet. 

Surprisingly, Housing and 
Dining Services Director Larry 
Barren says that roughly a fifth of 
UCSD's student housing qualifies 
as legally accessible. 

However, Barrett added that he 
works closely with disabled stu-
dents to meet their particular needs. 

"Our standard practice is, if the 
student tells us far enough in 
advance, that we actually will sit 
down and say, 'What are your 
needs?'" Barrett said. "We will fix 
that room or that apartment for 
them." 

Barrett said accessibility varies 
greatl y by college. In Revelle, for 
example, the stairs around the 
Revelle Mudhuts make wheelchair 
access impossible. However, cer-
tain rooms in Argo and Blake Halls 
have been modified 10 accommo-
date students with disabilities. 

Generally, newer buildings are 
more accessible - the Marshall 
residence halls were once named a 
model of accessibility, and every 
last Warren dorm room is designed 
to accommodate wheelchair users 
with roll-in showers, wider pas-
sages and lower peepholes in the 
doors. 

Campus dining facilities are 
generally well-designed, with a 
couple of minor exceptions -
most memordbly, the map outside 
the new Sierra Summit that is sup-
posed to direct patrons in wheel-
chairs to the nearest accessible 
restrooms. Not only is the map 
unlabeled, it's orientation is off by 
90 degrees. Anyone unfamiliar 
with Muir who followed the direc-
tions would find themselves some-
where around the Sun God.

whole graduation is student-run. 

What have you 
learned from all the 
phy./cal adlvlt/e. 
you do? 
"I learned that I can 
do things I never 
thought that I 
would be able to. It 
made me realize 
that I can do 
anythln, If I put my 
mind to It." 
As a graduating 
.enlor, what do you 
thInk of UCSD? 
"I like It, but I wish 
people were 
friendlier, sillier and 
would smile more." 

- Danlka Hili 
Revelle Senior 

We pick the programs, the speak-
ers, everything. We are going to try 
to do a senior week this year." 
What has being a RISC staff 
member been like? 

"RISC is just for fun . The peo-
ple in it are really cool, and it is a 

The UCSD Guardian 

good stress reliever." 
What Is your favorite sport? 

"It is probably a tie between 
surfing and snowboarding." 
What have you I •• ned from all 
the physical activities you do? 

"1 learned that I can do things I 
never thought that I would be able 
to. It made me reaiize that 1 can do 
anything if 1 put my mind to it." 
As a &raduatlnc 18nlor, what do 
you think of UCSD? 

"I like it, but I wish people were 
friendlier, sillier and would smile 
more." 

What would you have done differ· 
ently over the last three years? 

"I would have studied more. 
As a freshman, I wouldn't have 
worried about what other people 
thought of me. I think I would 
have tried to learn more lan-
guages. I would have gone to 
more panies." 
If you had two Wllhes, what 
would you wish for? 

"[ wish students were forced to 
travel and learn about other cul-
tures. I also wish that we would 
appreciate our children more and 
take better care of them. They are 
our future." 
Can you pick a word that 
describes you best? 

"I'm just me. There's too much 
to me to be described by just one 
word ." 

SOAPBOX: 
Students not ready 
for the workplace 
Continued from Pac. 12 
this class is the end-of-the-quarter 
group show of the drawings and 
paintings made by the students. 
Once upon a time, the university 
used to pay for refreshmems at the 
reception, announcements, invita-
lions and a catalogue. 

The importance of a show for 
an undergraduate art student is 
immeasurable. Shows are hands-
on experiences of what it's like to 
be a profe sional artist - skills 
like marketing, hanging and plac-
ing the work, and assembling the 
show itself are invaluable experi -
ences. Earning a spot in an art 
catalogue is highly regarded by 
graduate and art schools . 

These are critical aspects of a 
visual arts education and of learn-
ing to be an artist - yet the 
school cannot find the money to 
support then? 

What docs that say about the 
university's attitude toward the 
visual arts? What does that say 
about the university's attitude 
toward the students who it has a 
responsibility to educate? 
Doesn ' t the university want ALL 
of its students to become viable 
members of the workforce? Is 
this the university's attitude about 
the social sciences? 

At some point, the university 
administrators must realize that 
just because society believes that 
the only education worth any-
thing is one in the sciences, that 
docs not mean that it is right. The 
university cannot consider itself 

FEA111RES IS 

well-rounded or even reputable if 
the humanities departments are 
merely tokens in the educational 
fonune. 

Visual-arts students pay tuition 
just like everyone else here. Most 
of our classes meet six hours per 
week and require extensive work 
outside class, for which we get the 
same four units as everyone else. 
We need and deserve funding like 
everyone else. 

The visual arts department has 
the capability and the amazingly 
renowned faculty to produce top-
notch artists - but it does not 
fund the department. This is a 
social and cultural travesty. 

I feel let down by the school 
that 1 carefully chose from thoo-
sands for my undergraduate edu-
cation. When I came to this uni-
versity, I expected that no matter 
what I changed my major to, I 
would get an excellent and com-
plete education, supplying me 
with marketable skills as I 
entered the workforce. 

As it is, I haven't acquired 
enough general knowledge about 
art-making in the program to pass 
the California Board of Education 
Standardized Test and get a 
Single Subject Teaching 
Credential in art.

WHEELS: 
RIMAC's disability 
services inadequate 
Continued from page 14 
me for not making a reservation 
ahead of time, and proceeded to 
load me into the van. Everything 
went fine unlil we reached my des-
tination, when the lift decided to 
short out and die. 

NOI to worry, Lhe driver said, 
the lift was just rusty because it 
hadn 't been used in a month or so. 
This is supposed to rca sure me? 
In any case, there was a manual 
release and I didn 't have to worry 
about being held hostage by shuttle 
services until a mechanic showed 
up. 

After fiddling with cranks and 
valves for a couple of minutes. the 
dnver found and pulled the emer· 
gency release pin - and the li ft 
went crashing to the ground. She 
cranked it back up and lowered me 
without incident, but to say I was 
unnerved IS the understatement of 
the year. 

Friday's shuttle run went 
smooLhly enough, evcn though the 
driver confided that he had just 
learned how to tie a wheelchair 
down Lhat morning. 

Accordtng to Shuttle 
Coordinator Frank Buono of 
Transportation and Parking 
Services, six of UCSD's 20 shuttle 
buses - in addition to the van -
are equipped with wheelchair lifts. 

Buono said that even though 
"we've been averaging one pickup 
every two months," drivers are still 
supposed to inspect the lifts before 
Lhey leave the shuttle yard. 

"The driver isn't supposed to 
get out to a stop and find someone 
waiting to find that the lift doesn'l 
work," he said, 

In addition, Buono said that new 
drivers are given between 45 min· 
utes and an hour of wheelchair train· 
ing. and that he tries to update dri-
vers ' training at least once per year. 

FRIDAY, 2:45 P.M. 
The wonUln at the RIMAC front 

desk opens the gare for me; I wave 
my I.D. card ar her arul cruise on 
by. The weight arul activity rooms 
are reasonably accessible, and I 
found my way around the cav· 
ernous locker room easily enough, 
buJ the reSI of RIMAC leaves a lil-
tie to be desired. 

R1MAC administrators seem 
obsessed with security, perhaps 
rightly so, and anyone wanting to 

use the elevators has to be cleared 
first through the sports facillttcs 
department. Someone Lhere entcrs 
your I.D. number into the comput-
er, and you're set - swipe your 
card, and IIoila 

Even once I got down to the rae· 
quetballievel, a couple of problems 
remained. How was I supposed to 
get to court level? I found a wheel· 
chair lift tucked away in a comer, 
but it was locked. Since I had a 
class in a few minutes, I left and 
vowed to retum. 

When I finall y did, a week or 
so later, I went to the equipment 
desk and asked what would hap-
pen if someone rolled up in a 
wheelchair and wanted to play 
racquetball. Nobody knew the lift 
even existed , much less where the 
keys were. 

Recreation Director Ch uck 
lJurmJcy. who oversees Lhc ra, · 
quetball courts, said the lift should 
always be on for people to use on 
their own, and was at a loss to 
explarn why it wasn't 

Gormley promised to have it 
unlocked immediately. 

SATURDAY, 2:35 P.M. 
Arriving safely at the 

Guardian, I strip off my ruined 
gloves, unbuckle the seat belt for 
the lasl time and step free of the 
wheelchair, I was ollly ill the clrair 
for a week alld - III/like mOSI 
wheelchair users - I could 
always get up if thillgs got /00 
messy, 

Pete PulOn, a quadriplegic stu· 
dent who uses a motorized wheel-
chair to get around campus, was 
once trapped in a bathroom. He 
only escaped when someone heard 
his service dog barking and set him 
free . Another student was trapped 
for hours in an elevator at night, 
unable to free himself until a cus-
todian using the elevator let him 
out. 

I had to reach out and haul 
myself out of narrow doorways all 
the time, but I was never well and 
truly stuck. Still, I learned a lot 
from the experience: that noLhing 
is as nat as it seems, that people 
tend to slare at anyLhing that does· 
n't quite fit their mold of normal, 
that I would have had shoulders 
like Arnold Schwarzenegger if I 
had kept the wheelchair much 
longer, and that people with dis-
abilities are deserving of the same 
accommodations as everyone 
else. 

That isn't always how it is, but 
that's how it should be.

The UCSD Guardian Monday. December I. 1997 
--~-------------------------------------------------------------------------SPORTS 23 

MEN: Tritons 
bludgeoned by big-
time Beavers 
ContInued from pace 24 
but not enough to bring down the 
imposing Beavers. 

The men stuck to their staples. 
firing from downtown and press-
ing relentlessly on defense. Mike 
Wall led the charge, scoring 17. 
Sweet shooter Nick Maroutsos 
poured in 14 points, including 
four three-point baskets, and 
Tyler Garratt scored I 3 to go 
along with three steals. 

Indicative of the Tritons' size 
deficiency, Garratt tied with Mark 
Sebek for the team hIgh with four 
rebounds. Sam Higgins and 
Adam Libby each scored II 
points, while backup point guard 
Lee Nafarrete notched five assists 
in 14 minutes in his first action of 
the young season. 

The Tritons shot only 34 per-
cent for the game, compared with 
60 percent for OSU. The men left 
the rebounding to the Beavers as 
well. with nine Beavers grabbing 
at least five rebounds, earning a 
66-27 advantage on the boards. 

The Triton press and deep 
bench had some success, causing 
enough mayhem to result in 24 
turnovers, but OSU exploded to a 
67-36 halftime advantage after 
the ftrst 10 minutes. 

"We were with Oregon State 
for the first quarter of the game," 
Libby said. "Our guys played 
hard all game and I'm proud of 
them. We went in there thinking 
how we could play bette~ as a 
team.. . especially as far as 
defense and our communication 

011 the court." 
Play ing in front of a raucous 

crowd of 6,500, the Beavers were 
led by Corey Benjamin with 23 
points, Nick Greene was right 
behind with 22. and Jason Heide 
scored 15. Heide also had 10 
rebounds in only 13 minutes. 

What was UCSD's chance of 
winning? 

"Maybe one in 100," Triton 
Assistant Coach Dave Dillon 
said. "We'd have to shoot 100 
percent and they'd have to miss 
all their shots. Athletically and 
heightwise, they were dominant." 

However, the game served to 
measure the Tritons' development 
and gave an opportunity for the 
meO' to go all out, with no expcc-
tations and nothing to lose. 

"It was a good experience for 
us," Head Coach Greg Lanthier 
said. "I think if! had to do it over 
again. I wouldn't have pressed the 
first half, but that's the style we 
play. I was surprised how hard 
Oregon State played for that long 
a period of time, but as soon as 
we adjusted to the physicalness of 
the game. I thought we were fine. 
I thought our kids did good," 

"I thought we played better 
against Oregon State than the 
teams in Texas," said point guard 
Libby, who dished five assists in 
26 minutes_ "We learned we can 
play with a Division I team. 
We've got a big stretch run here 
against Division m teams, anci_ 
playing Oregon State :. only 
going to help." 

The ;',en's team will playa 
:-ilore evenly matched opponent 
tonight at Claremont, and on 
Wednesday duels Pomona-Pitzer 
on the road. 

WOMEN: 
Tritons earn split in 
Wisconsin Tourney 
ContInued from pace 24 
half 38-18, The. Tritons could not 
dial long distance, missing on six 
of seven three-point attempts in the 
first half. Oshkosh made the most 
of their chances, hitting 15 of 31 
shots in the opening 20 minutes -
a solid .484 field goal conversion 
rate. UCSD, however, connected 
on just 7 of 27 from the floor. 

The Oshkosh Titans (3-1) relied 
on balanced scoring to jump ahead. 
AII-Tournament selections 
Stephanie Warnkle, Rachel 
Lacheki and Kelly Warnkle 
(Tournament Most Valuable 
Player) led the charge_ Lacheki led 
the squad with 10 rebounds and six 
steals. The Wamkle sisters added 
10 points each. 

Oshkosh applied stingy defense 
all night, stealing the ball 16 times 
and forcing UCSD into 25 
turnovers. The Tritons were able to 
out-rebound their opponent 41-33 
- including 14 offensive boards 
- but failed to cash in on the extra 
opportunities, Summer Begley tal-
lied eight boards. while Krista 
Poehler chipped in with six. 

In Friday's semifinal 6am.!, 
UCSD used a late c~.:'; ·ge in the sec-
ond half LO down Wisconsin 

L'!~tCran College by 10 points. The 
Tritons held a slim 26-22 lead, but 
outscored Lutheran College by 
seven points in the last 20 minutes 
to pull out the victory. 

Earlier in the week, the Tritons 
began the 1997 -98 season on the 
road with a royal thrashing of Cal 
Tech,88-13. 

Ioerd work: Karli Jungwirth's presence inside the paint helped 
her earn AII-;;:,urnament honors at the Wisconsin Holiday Classic. 

Jenessa Bayda led all scorers 
with 19 points. Tristen Tisdale 
added 13 points, while Jungwirth 
contributed eight rebounds. The 
Tritons comfortably led at halftime 
42-7, cruising to the win. 
Defensively, UCSD played a phe-
nomenal game, forcing 28 
turnovers. The women shut down 
Cal Tech's offense, as the visitors 
could only convert 6 of 27 field 
goals. 

UCSD will enjoy the great 

Wisconsin weather for another day, 
battling Lawrence College today 
before returning home to rainy La 
Jolla. 

Malone's squad must now pre-
pare for a tough week ahead. After 
their contest against Lawrence 
today, the Tritons will travel across 
the country anJ play at Claremont 
thi~ Friday night, following that up 
with another road game - at Point 
Loma Nazarene College on the fol-
lowing night.

Conspiracy Plots 

Let me start off with a little 
background on my favorite sub-
ject; me. I'm not a student. I'm 
a full-time staff member of the 
Guardian business office, your 
quintessential advertising man. 

Normally the business (full 
time) and editorial (student) 
staff don 't co-mingle their func-
tions here, Dij! on occasion I've 
bullied an editor lO W vlJblishing 
my rants. Well , until they tL'{:!< 
away my pencil a few years ' 
back, anyway. 

With the kids takmg a few 
days off for Thanksgiving, I' ve 
got the office to myself. I'm 
back. 

Havi ng babysitled these 
clods for 10 years, I've been 10 
a unique' position to observe 
transi tion. In the sport writing. 
I've noted that there has always 
been a lot of commentary on 
non-UCSD sport~ : . FL, NBA, 
major college, boxing and more. 
Even the Simpson tnal and the 
crimes of fi gure skater Tonya 
Harding were mentioned. 

This is fine by me. UCSD 
isn't in the busi ness of training 
Journalists, so columnists fal l 
back on subject they are mter-
ested in Good writing about 
popular evenlS like a Super 
Bowl or World Series always 
has appeal. 

There is one curious phe-
nomenon I've witnessed that 
still has me stumped - the pre-
ponderance of San Francisco 
Bay Area expatriates that end up 
writing for Guardian sports. 
Even non-Bay honks gravitate 
to our front door and pick up the 
baton. This tradition dates back 
as far as I can remember. 

In 1989, the San Francisco 
Giants and Oakland A's met in 
the famed "Earthquake" World 
Series. Our sports editor and his 
associate ran a full page on the 
event, with graphics and posi-
tion-by-position analysis. These 
two later collaborated on a 
spring training photo essay 
about their visit to the Giants' 
and A's camps. 

In the 1990 Serie~, the asso-
cIate sport editor had a prob-
lem with the Reds ' surprising 
sweep of the A's. He ran a sour-
grapes piece, entitled "Reds Are 
Not the Better Team," just to set 
the record straight. 

Throughout the '90s, these 
valentines to the Bay Area 
sports teams have flourished. A 
Nov. '92 column waxed on the 
great tradition of the annual 
Cal-Stanford football game. 

Should the Giants win a few 
10 Apnl , we're sure to see pieces 
like that of June I, 1993, in 
whIch our columnist frets that 
Will Clark and his boys may 
pull their annual choke. Even 
the lowly NBA Warriors have 
gotten ink.

8'GOSH: The 
Triton women 
traveled to 
Wisconsin for the 
6th Annual 
Wisconsin Holiday 
Classic, falling to 
UW-Oshkosh in the 
Champion hip 
game 

By Sean Rahlml 
Senior Staff Writer 

Turkeys, family get-togethers and Wi consin, For most college stu-
dents, the first two are staples of their annual Thanksgiving weekends. 
Parents fly their kids home for some eating followed by more eating, 
sending them back to college 10 pounds heavier. 

The UCSD women's basketball squad, however, added 
Wisconsin to its itinerary. Triton Head Coach Judy Malone and 
company traveled to Oshkosh, Wisconsin, for the 6th Annual 
University of Wisconsin-Oshko'h Women's Basketball Holiday 
Classic. 

While their UCSD classmates sat in their homes, sleeping off 
a full day of eating, the Tritons spent the weekend running up and 
down the hardwood floor at Kolf Sports Center. 

UCSD began the weekend with a 69-59 victory over 
Wiscon in Lutheran College Friday afternoon to advance to Saturday's 
championship game against the host school - UW-Oshkosh. 

TIle Tritons could not turn Friday's momentum into a win Saturday, 
though, falling to Oshkosh 67-49 in the title game. 

On the brighter side, seniors Karli Jungwirth and Amy McClure 
earned All-Tournament honors. McClure led everyone in scoring with 14 
points off the bench in only 16 minutes of play in Saturday's finale. 

In the title game, UCSD (2-1) fell behind early on and trailed at the

DAMMED: UCSD 
was overmatched 

when the men's 
basketball team 

travelled north to 
Corvallis, Oregon, 
to tangle with the 
Oi vision I Oregon 

State Beavers, 
losing 116 - 78 

Beavers do;; 't inspire fear. Kind of cute and furry, big buck teeth, cute 
little paddle-type taii. You have L~t' feeling your average God-like Triton 
would whoop the tar out of the little dam-buijd.:r. 

But in Tuesday night's game in Corvallis, Oregon, the Tritons 
faced the Division I breed of beaver - one that is considerably 
taller and faster than the Lords of La Jolla. The difference 
showed, as Oregon Stale 's basketball team ran around, over and 
through the efforts of the men's defense to win I! 6-78. 

After opening the season with a win and a loss at the 
Southwestern University Invitational in Texas, the men's basket-
ball team turned north to test its mettle. 

Though Oregon State isn't among the big-time programs of 
the PAC-IO, they have turned out some pretty respectable ball 

players such as Gary Payton and Brent Barry. and this season they have 
plenty of talent and size. 

The Tritons, meanwhile, are undersized this season even by UCSD 
standards, and currently lack a true center. The Tritons might as well 
have brought along a few pebbles to toss at their Goliath of an opponent. 
because without crippling the competition. the chances of victory were 
slim. 

The Tritons did sling a few three-pointers, firing up 51 in the game,
