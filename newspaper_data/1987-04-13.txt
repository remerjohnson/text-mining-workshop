Referenda 
.plagued by 
lowtumout 
By JAMES Q. GILMORE 

Low voter turnout was 
respons ible for invalidating the 
"Intercollegiate Athletics Upgrade 
&: Football Re~ rend urn" and the 
"Coop Referendum," on last week's 
election ballot. 

Both referenda called for 
tudent fee increase . The 6.50 

Increase proposed in the Athletlcs 
Referendum would have been used 
to upgrade UCSD's Intercollegiate 
sports programs and establi h a 
Division III football program. The 
money generated by the proposed 
'[;1.00 Coop Referendum's fee 
in rease would have been used to 
establish and pay a Coop 
Administrative taff which would 
facilitate the expansion of existing 
on-campus student-run cooper-
atives and the establishment of 
new coops. 

Although both measures 
received well over 50 percent of the 
vote , the total number of votes cast 
was Insufficient to validate a 
stud nt fe mcrease. The eiec(()ral 
guidelines which govern any 
proposed student fee increase 
tate that for such a referendum to 

be considered valid, it shall be 
passed by a 50 percent plus one 
margin , and the total number of 
votes cast must equal the average 
number of voters compiled from 
the previous three election . Both 
referendums were short by 
approximately 400 votes. 

Author of the Athletics 
Referendum , Warren Sophomore 
Senator Chris Rys, hopes to appeal 
to the administration [0 accept the 
proposal as valid , "Although the 
referendum is not binding [0 the 
administration , I feel that if they 
wanted to they could still go 
forward with it; the ball's in their 
court." 

Student Activities Director 
Randy Woodard said that although 
both measures passed with over 60 
percent of the vote, "they cannot be 
em forward to the Chancellor; 

even if they were, he would not 
'end them to the Regents for they 
mu st satisfy the elc toral 
reqUirements." 

Ted Herzog of the Coop 
Committee aid , "The same thll1g 
happcnded last year, the Coop 
Referendum pa sed With about 80 
pCrl.ent of the votes, yet was also 
declared invalid ... we'll Just try it 
again next spnng "

& PETER MESSROBIAN, Cll lVr Staff Wrlla 

Although plagued by an 18.8

two of the ballot's referenda, last 
week's ASUCSD general elections

candidates, the ballots will be

computer rwlce. The results Will be 
announced Immediately there-
after. 

David Marchick and Eric Weiss are the apparent run -off candidates 
for the AS Presidency. 

However, a the Guardwn wa:, 
going to press, It was learned from 
A.S. Elecnons Manager Lynn Yuen 
that errors were made both 10 
markmg and tabulatmg the ballots. 
Both because of this and a recount

cand idate who asked fora re aunt,

Cheryl Monblan 10 the Reve lle 
College Senior Senator race, 
according to the mltlal count. 
Another close race was the contest 
for MUlrJumorSenator, with Stacey 
Bowman polling four more votes 
than Jeanne Gobby , aga in 
accordi ng to the first ballot count. 

Center bid awarded to Blake 
By PETER MESSROBlAN. SenIOr Staff Writer In the most important race , for 

A.5. President, David Marchick was 
the clear winner, with 47 .82 
percent of the vote, but there was 
only a seven vote difference 
berween runner-up Eric Weiss and 
third place fimsher DaVid Fnend. 
According to Election Manager 
Yuen, a handful of ballots, "enough 
to make a difference," were either 
not punched hard enough or 
voters Incorrectly clr led their 
choice with pencil or pen. 

The winning bid of $13,713,000 
for the construction of the new 
University Center and Bookstore 
was officially accepted on Tuesday, 
April 7. 

Blake Construction Company, a 
general contractor ba ed In 
Washington D.C. , will build the 
Center, which will house a multi-
purpose hall seating 1,200, a 500-
person capacity theater, 14 tudent 
meeting rooms, five fast food 
outlets, a pub, recreation rooms, 
and some student organization 
offices. 

Blake is currently completing 
the San Diego Naval Hospital in 
Balboa Park, and has built libraries, 
Sports centers, classroom 
build i ngs, and other special 
purpose buildings in the past for 
universities. Blake Vice-President 
Dave Lippert explained that his 
company has done most of its 
work back East, and first came out 
here three and a half years ago to 
construct the Naval hospital. 

Speaking about the University 
Center, Lippert said that "this is 
not your average building project 
It's a unique kind of structure and I 
think everyone will be happy with 
it." While th is will be the 
company's first project of this type, 
Lippen believes that Blake is 
"pretty well quahfied" to build the 
University Center be ause of the 
Wide variety of Jobs they have 
taken on in the past. 

Tommy Tucker was more than 
atisfied With the entire planning 

pro ess, from the initial Idea to the 
electlon of the general contractor. 
aIling It '" th e miracle on 

Hutchinson Way (the street where 
the enter IS located)," Tucker, the 
AsSistant Vice Chancellor for 
Undergraduate Affair , seemed 
qUite ontcm a he talked about 
the project he has nurtured along 
for the pa t two and a half years. 

'T 0 ay thll1g~ are gomg okay is 
em understatement," aid a reheved 

- Etched in tone 
UNDA- the late 
addlti n to the tuan 

ollcction. 

Tucker, "and I wouldn't want to 
start over." Tucker was enthusiastic 
over what he termed the "quality 
and consisten y" of the even bids, 
which were all within about ten 
percent of each other. 

The bids only in luded butldll1g 
the Center and Bookstore. The 
total price will be about '[; 188 
mtllton , including utilities, 
Inspection fees , equipment 
(baSically anything not bolted 
down ; i.e. furniture , sound 
systems, lighting), ite clearing 
(cutting down tree and preparing 
the land) the actual construction 
costs , plus maintenance and 
operation of the Center once it is 
finished . 

Jim Carruthers, who ran San 
Diego State University's Aztec 
Center for ten years and was most 
recently UCSD's Associate Dean of 
Extension, is the new director of 
the University Center. "My job now 
is to get the building moving along 
and ready to open, hire staff, and 
negotiate food contracts, among 
other things," he said. 

Carruthers spoke of the 
planning, development and 
biddmg process as being a 

"textbook case," and said that it 
was "amazing to come Within one 
percent" of the onginal pnce 
estimate of $18.65 million . 

In fact, the Winning bid was over 
'[;300 ,000 below what the budget 
had allowed for, but equipment 
costs Will be about 450,000 higher 
than onginally projected (which 
was before the building was 
actually deSigned). The overrun IS 
very small, however, and does not 
present a problem. 

The $5 .5 mdlion UCSD 
Bookstore, which will be part of the 
Center, will not be paid for in any 
way by the student money resulti ng 
from the fee hike, but will pay it's 
own way plus use other money 
available to it. 

Construction is expected to 
begin no later than June 1, 
according to Carruthers . 
Approximately $1 million wonh of 
work has been done already in 
preparing the site for what the 
director called "one of the most 
complex buildings on campus." 

The expected completion date 
of the Center and Bookstore is 
sometime in fall quarter, 1988, as 
originally promised. eJ 

GuardLin 61e pholO 
Blake 's bid moves the Student Center closer to completion. 

Another problem, brought up by 
both En Weiss and DaVid Friend, 
was th e alignment of the ballot In 
the voting machme. The members 
of the League of Women Voters, 
who oversaw the ballonng process, 
may have lined up the ballots 
incorrectly so that when a voter 
selected a candidate , they were 
actually selecnng someone other 
than they intended. 

Friend, who narrowly missed 
making the run-off, is the 
candidate most likely to benefit 
from a recount. He said he was 
surprised to hear there was co be 
one, but was not hopeful of gaining 
a spot in the run-off. "If there is 
something wrong, I hope it was just 
a miscount and not an ele tion 
violation .. .! don't see there being a 
big change (due to the recount). 
What's done' to the ballots is done," 
Friend contends. "If It turns out I 
have more votes, I'm glad." 

Although Eri c Wei S I 
confident the recoum Will not 
affect him , he nonethele 
expre sed dlsappolntmem With 
the electoral proces . Immediately . 
.lIter receiving ncws of the ballot 
problcms, WCISS declared he was 
"Sick to hi stom,1 h over the whole 
thll1g," but he refused to blame 
anyone for the problem . He 
cblmed to have spoken with 
Tommy Tucker and Rand ),

New bill addresses 
campus rape 

A bill was proposed last month that 
calls for mandatory student educatIOn of 
rape on aU college campuses, and for 
the impositlon of stricter penalties 
by a univerSity condu t committee on 
students conVicted of rape or sexual 
misconduct. 

The bill, proposed by State 
A<;scmblymember Tom Hayden (D- anta 
MOllica), rose , In pall as a respon e to 
the hIghly pubhClzed sexual assaults at 
UCLA and UC Berkele} 

Hayden was also inOucnced by a 
narlonal survey conducted by a Kent 
"late psycholOgist that Inund that one 111 
ever) eIght college women Will be raped 
The stud, also fl)Und that 95 percent of 
the rapes arc "date" rape, ommmed by 
acquaIntances 

A UC anta Barbara study done 
dunng spring quarter 19 6 found that 
there are between three to ten rapes 
committed each week at UCSB alone. 

Suspension, expulsion from school. 
loss of scholarships, separation in 
dormitories and loss of affiliation for 
fra term ty members arc some of the more 
Sliff penalties the bill outlines. 

S111ce the University of Califomla IS 
an autonomous body of the state 
govemment, the law mu t obtain regent 
approval m order for It to affect the UC 
system. The bill will be wntten so that it 
require state, private and JUlllor colleges 
to abide by It With an option for regent 
approval. 

New personnel plan 
draws opposition 

University of California offiCials have 
drafted a proposal that would restructure 
personnel policies and pay scales for 
more than 10,000 administrative and 
profeSSIOnal staff employees systemWide 
if Implemented on July 1. 

The proposal, which has drawn some 
cntlClsm by employees, is part of a four-
phase plan to streamline personnel 
poliCies on aU nme UC campuses. 

UC Berkeley admInistrators delayed 
Implementing one part of the plan that

calls for a merit-based wage system after 
affected cmployees expressed their 
opposition. 

Under the ncw plan , administrative 
and profeSSional staff employees would 
no longer rcceive automatlc pay ral es 
adjusted accordll1g to yearly state 
budgets. The new plan would, instead, 
reqUire employees to fa e an annual 
evaluation of their Job performance by 
their Immediate upervlsor. The 
evaluation would be the baSIS for 
cal ulJtll1g pa), r,\Ises Jnd promotions

be rcqUircu to serve a SIX· month

might lead to a arrer emplo} ee ' 
contmcr. A two-tier wage s}'stem would 
be Implemented thJt would result In 
lowered wages for meomlng employees 
dunng the probationary period. 

orne UC Berkeley administrative and 
profesSIonal staff employees fear that a 
merit-based pay plan would gIve 
supervisors too much control over terms 
of employment that need to be 
structurally defined. Employees also fear 
that supervisors' conscious and 
unconscious prejudices will lead to 
arbitral)' and discnminatory pay raise 
decisions. 

Employees charge the new plan with 
having a grievance procedure that 
doesn 't provide for outside arbitrators 
until the fi nal steps of the process. 
Opponents say su h a procedure allows 
for greater possibilities for acts of 
discrimmation to take place. 

Administrators will review the 
employees' comments before the plan 
#>es i mo effect.

Scripps to team up 
with NASA 

Scientists at UCSD's Scripps 
Instirution of Oceanography are 
proposing to establish a center for the 
commercial development of space 
technology through a program 
ponsored by the National Aeronautics 

and Spa e Administration ( ASA) and 
are seeking lI1dustriai participants. 

The proposed center would 
concentrate on ways to analyze the 
ocean and earth environments that 
utilize sophisticated remote sensing 
instruments on board ealth-orbiting 
satelhtes. By utilizing remote sensing 
techniques, scientists can gather 
conti nuous data on conditions in the 
ocean and in the 1l000osphere on a 
global basis, which is not possible by 
using ships, airplanes, or buoys. 

According to Dr. Catherine Gautier, a 
research meteorologist at Scripps 
lnsurution, the center would stimulate 
commercial development of remOte 
sensing technologies in ocean and 
global earth sciences. Such development 
could have Significant applications in 
mdustries impacted by the oceans, such 
as commercial fishing, ocean shipping, 
recreational boating, and weather 

prediction, she saiu. 
NASA has funded mne sp,lce 

development centers over the paSl three 
year, each designed to concentr.lte on 
Ol1e area of space technology 
development th,1t h;.$ direct commericial 
potential. Among the goals of the 
proposed SCrippS Institution center IS to 
develop ways of transferring satellite 
data technologies used in ocean and 
earth sciences to private enterprise. 

The development of computer 
software and hardware for satellite 
remote sensing of the marine 
environment IS another major part of 
the proposed center. One valuable 
product would be the creation of low-
COSt computer systems thai could be 
placed on ShipS, includmg commerc l,t1 
tmnspOrlS, cru ise hners, and private 
yachts. This would supply the shlp's 
personnel with direct ,Iccess to critical 
mfOlmation about weather and sea

Marchick '5 originality 
Edilor: 

We are writing in response to 
your editorial regarding the AS. 
elections. As members of the 
current AS. Council, we found it 
ironic that AS Presidential 
Candidate David Marchick was 
praised by the Guardian for "being 
original in his ideas and plans." A 
close examination of the facts will 
reveal evidence to the contrary: 
1) The Shuule: Marchick claims 
that he will work tOward solving 
parking problems on campus with 
a shuttle. What he fails to explain is 
that the UCSD Planning Office and 
Admlllistration has been planning 
a shuttle system for several years 
and has already committed to an 
on-campus shuttle ... whether 
Dave Marehick is elected AS. 
President or not. 
2) Exltntkd Library/ Study Hall 
Hours: This idea and project has 
been the past year's work of AS. 
Academic Affairs Commissioner 
Michelle Hopkins, Muir College 
Senator Russ Heilig, and Executive 
Lobby DirectorJilI Marchick - nO! 
that of David Marchick! The 
referendum on this issue, written 
by Senator HeilIg, will be rhe 
impetus for extended library 
hours ... whether Dave Marchick IS 
elected AS. President or not. 
3) TA Training: Marchick claims he 
will set up TA training courses to 
alleviale TA communication 
problems. However, thiS program 
already exists in the form of 
English as a Second Language 
(ESL) programs. In addition, AS. 
Vice President Extemal Eric Weiss 
was the only member of UCSA to 
actively work toward eth n ic-
specific ESL programs and non-
discriminatory TA communication 
skiDs (TOEFL) tests for native bom 
and foreign born TA 's. 
Furthermore, the UC Regents have 
already supplemented the training 
program by $750.000 for next year. 
Thus, there will be more T A 
training next year ... whether Dave 
Marchick is elected AS. President 
or not. 

David Marchick is taking credit 
for the work of others. These 
"centerpieces" of Marchick's 
campaign were obtained largely 
from informational reports of other 
councilmembers at AS. council 
meetings. They are hardly original 
and they are certainly not his 
ideas.! 

We are disappointed that Dave 
Marchtck has attempted to deceive 
UCSD students in his campaign 
for AS. President. We arc further 
disappotnted thai the Guardian 
permined itself to be deceived by 
Marchick in its failure to verify the 
bases for its conclusions. 

To Mr. Marchick - you can fool 
some of the people some of the 
time, but you can't fool aU of the 
people, all of the timel

"Great," Beebe said. "Because 
the stones are also a word-poem 
about surfing. They tell of waiting 
for the perfect wave ." 

The 20 tons of stone arrived 
from England last month and were 
mstalled on March 31 , making thiS 
the sixth addition to UCSD's Stuart 
Collection. 

The artist of UNDA is England's 
Ian Ham ilton Finlay. Known 
primanly in the past as a poet, he is 
fast establishing his reputation as 
an intern ationally reknowned 
sculptor, wi th four shows opening 
m Pans th is summer. UNDA IS 
Fi nlay's first sculptu re in America.

Coming from such an eclectic 
background , it is no wonder that 
Fmlay's sculpture contains so 
many layers of meaning. "It's li ke a 
pUZzle," Beebe said. "It takes a long 
time before you figure it aU out." 

The sculpture omments on its 
se tting m many ways. For instance, 
the limestone was chosen because 
it relates to the color of the nearby 
dilTs. Although quarried in the 
COlSwold's of England, the stones

Left in a primitive, unpolished 
form with the drill marks still 
Visible on the sides, the stones also 
se rve as a solid contrast to "the 
comparatively light and temporary 
look of the Humanities Building 
and the Third College apartments," 
Beebe sa id . 

Carved with the word 'unda,' 
and the printer's sign, which 
means "to transpose these letters," 
each s to ne is a differem 
progressIOn in forming the correct 
order of the four letters. Hence, the

sign functions as a wave literally, by 
rolling the letters to dilTerent places 
on each stone, and metaphorically, 
as Finlay uses this poetic device to 
refer to the velocity and flow of 
l;inguage. _ 

Finlay, who never leaves 
England, collaborated with his wife 
on this project. Beebe met with 
both of them in England to initiate 
the project and Sue Finlay came tQ 
UCSD taking hundreds of pictures 
of possible sites. Finlay's finished 
work brings a part of America's 
English heritage back to us within 
a speCifically Southern Catifornia 
context. 

On the north field, the 
horizontal set up of the stones 
relates to the trees on the other side 
of the field as well as to the horizon 
of the ocean. Used as benches, this 
sculpture is a perfect place to view 
the sunset on a romantic evening. 
The ocean waves in the 
background add yet anOlher 
dimension to the meaning of 
UNDA. 

"II's a rock solid piece, both 
literally and conceptually," Beebe 
said. "Universities are usually 
inward looking places. This 
sculpture , however, enhances 
one's inclination to look outward."

Attention All Students: 
The following Resolution was passed by the AS. We strongly urge you [Q 
read It and act upon it. Racism will not be tolerated by UCSD Students 

Resolution on Radio Racism 
Whereas, Randy Mille r of KS103 Radio has demonstrated a complete 
lack of sensitivity [Q the Asia n, Asian-American and Paci fic Islander 
community and has exercised poor journalistic discretion by 
encouraging racist Chinese jokes ro be broadcast on live radio; and 
Whereas,Randy Miller further insulted members of the community who 
protested his racist actions by issu ing a mocking and insincere apology 
for his actions; and 
Whereas, Ethnic humor only serves ro promote racial tenSion, racial 
violence, inaccuracies and misconceptions and deny individuals of 
their true cultural and personal identity; and 
Whereas,KS103 Station Manager Chris Conway has demonstrated 
concurance with Miller's action and thus has set forth a station policy 
which condones racism; and 
Whereas, the Associated Students of UCSD are strongly opposed to all 
forms of racism and bigotry; and 
Whereas, many UCSD students are offended by the actions of Randy 
Miller, and 
Whereas, FCC-hscensed radio stations have a responsibility to serve the 
needs and interests of the community; and 
Whereas, KSI03 in its actions and policy, has neglected these 
responsibilities; 
Therefore, let it be ~huI, that the Associated Students condemn any 
and aU uses of ethnic humor; and 
Let it further be resolved, that the Associated Students condemn the 
aforementioned actions and policy of KSlO3 and demand immediate 
retraction of the "Chinese Jokes" and "mocking apology" of Randy Miller 
and demand issuance of a sincere and public apology by the 
management for his perpetuation of racism on live radio; and 
Let it further be resolved, that the Associated Students strongly urge 
UCSD students to boycott KS103 radio until the above listed demands 
have been met.

Tennis team wins again 
UCSD women look good 
I Spite of several fluke injuries, the UC 0 women's tennis team took another step rnward thc 
divi IOn III lanonals on Fnd'ly by 
beating Pomona-Pitzer, 8-1. Of 
their lOp SIX pldyers, five were hurt, 
yet each mdnaged 10 hobble onto 
th e MUir Courts for lhe 
competition 

The twO mOSl exciting mJtches 
both Involved JUnior Rhondd 
Meier. Playing on a sore ankle, ~he 
beat Kim Brown , 4-6 . 6-4, 7-5. 
Brown plays a patient. bdseline 
game, hilS soft returns and walts 
for her opponent to make .I 
mistake. It was .I method MCler 
wasn't used to dnd which forced 

her to change her own style. 
"Rhonda had to play realiy 

consistcnt, and Walt to put the bdll 
away," said UC D odch LIZ 
LdPlante. "It was really a mcnt,lliy 
tough match " 

Later, Meier and Chnstine 
Behrens beat Pomona's doubles 
tedm of Karen Nilsen and Julie 
LlIldberg, 6-1, 6-7,6-2. This was a 
slglllhcant ViCtOry for the Tritons 
because they had los t lh I' the last 
time the two teams mel. 

The only UCSD loss came as 
Julie Lindberg defeated Denise 

Ugl , 6-3, 6-D . .. he ( ugi) didn 't 
playas well as she could have," 
LaPlante said , adding that 

Lindberg hdd one of the better 
matche of th e year. 

Only one team from the Westem 
region IS gu,lranteed a SpOt in the 

ationais. Other than UCSD, the 
top quads arc from OCCidental, 
Claremont and Pomona-Pitzer. 
Pomona, however, has now lost [Q 
the Tmons tWi ce, and is no longer 
J con em. 

OCC idental, on the Other hand , 
bcat UCSD, 5-4, giving the Tritons 
their only divlsionlil loss. The next 
meeting of the twO teams will 
probably be the most Important 
onfrontalion of the season. 

Nancy Calhoun dominated her opponent 6-0, 6-2.

The American League East is by 
far the most difficult group 10 
evaluate because they arc all 
powerful and very good . But If 
balance is key to a successful team , 
the Toronto Blue Jays have the 
edge. They have power hmers; 
Jesse Barfield , George Bell and 
lioyd Moseby, one of the bcst 
ourfileders ever, combined for 92 
home runs last year. They have 
speed in Moseby and Tony 
Frenandez. Frenandez hit .3 10 last 

year m 163 games, Bell hit .309 and 
Rick Leach , former quarterba k.lt 
Michigan, hit .309m 110 games, so

some sorencss in their pitching 
elbows. And AI Ipper had a 
simply horrid spring training. In a 
league as powerful as the American 
League East, the Red ox will have 
to find a steady starttllg rotation . As 
for the rest of the field , Rich 
Gedman should be back by May(or 
else they're in trouble behind the 
plate). Wadc Boggs Will be Wade 
Boggs. Power will come from Don 
Baylor and Dave Henderson , the 
hero oflast year's American League 
Championship Series. NOI many 
changes in this squad. We11 see 
how this strategy fares against the 
competllion this year. 

The Detroit Tigers did lose 
Lance Parrish . With Parrish went a 
101 of their offense ... and defense. 
Mike Health will try to fill the gap 
but he has a little trouble controling 
the team on the field and will 
never be the same offenSively as 
Parrish. They will score runs 
though . The infield averaged over 
20 homeruns apiece and led the 
league wlrh 198. But they finished 
m third place. This year, the Tigers 
will be looking for their pitching 
st.lff [() keep their winning sryle 
behind the arms of the ace Jack 
MOlTls , the recovered Dan Petry 
Jnd even the aging Fmnk Tanana. 
They will also be expecting some 
senous power agalll from their 
infielders. They have the potential 
to go places. They JUSt have to put it 
all together during the seson . 

The l3altlmore Onoles turned 
old last year. They firtlshed In last 
place for the first time ever. Things 

were so bad that even EaJI'Weaver 
called It quits ... again. So now Carl 
Ripken , Sr. will spend the 1987 
season tryi ng to rebuild a once 
mighty and feared dynasty. He'll 
have to stan with a crumbled 
pitching stafr. Combined ERA: 
4.30. Combined com plete games: 
17 (the Dodgers Valenzuela had 20 
on his own). Only 6 shutouts. And 
this IS wnh a 2.98 ERA from reliever 
Don Aase. We're talking trouble. 
OffenSively, they have Eddie 
Mu rra y. And th e list stops there. 
Oh, Fred Lynn adds a couple of 
runs to the scorecard , bUI not 
enough to win many baD games. 
The Orioles wiD have to find their 
youth agam to be a threat in 1987. 

You know it is a difficult league 
when the last team e~n has 
potential ro do well. The 
Milwaukee Brewers are already 6-D 
this year. But theyare in the middle 
of a rebudd i ng process, so the
