More AS Money 
By Jeff Beresford-Howe 

A8IOClaae Newt Ellisor 
In a divisive and argumenta-

tive meeting Wednesday night, 
the AS Council approved two 
resolutions increasing fiscal 
allocations for the Gay Stu-
dents Union (GSU) and Wo-
men's Center. 

Both resolutions, sponsored 
by Student Welfare Commis-
sioner Barry Hyman, were to 
increase operating funds for 
the two organizations. The AS 
Finance Committee cut $100 
from the $285 request of the 
GSU and $274 from the $309 
requested by the Women's 
Center as supplements to last 
spring's allocations. 

Hyman charged that the 
committee members Ann 
Carberry, Jim Atkins, Sung 
Cboe and Alex Weyland were 
"sexist" in cutting the budgets, 

- and succeeded in convincing 
. tbe Council to grant the GSU 

and Women's Center requests 
in full. 

Hyman also said that he 
thought the Finance Commit-
tee wasn"t dealing with sub-
mitted budgets correctly, 
telling the Council that, "if (the 

Finance Committee) doesn't 
cut, they feel they don't have 
any power, that they're im-
potent." 

Hyman's accusations a-
roused the ire of more than one 
member of the Council. After 
all new business had been dealt 
with, Third College Repre-
sentative Sung Choe introduced 
a resolution calling for the 
Council to go on record as' 
saying that Hyman's accusa-
tions of sexism were "inap-
propriate and slanderous." 

Choe's resolution was to be 
brought before the Council next 
week, but Hyman told The 
Guardian yesterday that he 
would apologize to the Council 
if any members felt personally 
slighted by his attack on the 
Finance Committee. Hyman 
said he 'stood by his charge 
that the committee itself is 
sexist. 

Earlier the Council engaged 
in a heated discussion over 
another Hyman proposal to 
provide emergency funds to th 
UCSD Forum so that the 
organization could sponsor an 
on-campus speech by Frank

Arson Blamed For Blaze 
~150,OOO Damage Hits Broadmore Condos 
As Several Small Fires Prompt Investigation 

By Eric HarpeU 
The fire which gutted 16 

condominium units under 
construction off Gilman Drive 
late Tuesday night was de-
liberately set, a fire depart-
ment official said yesterday. 

The fire caused an estimated 
$150,000 damage at the Broad-
more Homes Condominiums, 
which were expected to be 
completed by early next year.

department could be called in, 

Smith to Vis.it S.D. 

According to Captain John 
Hunter of the San Diego fire 
department, "many scattered 
small fires" were burning in 
the immediate vicinity of the 
large blaze when the first fire 
fighting units arrived on the 
scene. 

The small fires are evidence, 
Hunter said, that one or more 
arsonists attempted to start the 
condominium burn ing by 
lighting fires throughout the 
structures. 

The flames, which could be 
seen easily from most on-
campus locations, attainefi a 
maximum height of " 60 or 
more feet," said Hunter. The 
entire immediate community 
was able to see bright reddish 
glow from the fire as it il-
luminated the sky near mid-
night. 

Hunter said that while there 
were no explosions in the fire, 
" In a frame structure of that 
type, the fire really takes of(," 
Only the wooden frameworks of 
the condominiums had been 
built and no hookups had been 
installed, so there were no 
volatile materials within the 
structures. 

Rhodesian Prime Minister in U.S.

Rhodesian Prime Minister 

Ian Smith will speak in San 
Diego tomorrow as part of his 
tour of the United States to 
explain his position on the 
situation in Rhodesia. 

Smith will speak at the Hotel 
Del Coronado on Coronado 
Island at a luncheon sponsored 
by the United Press Inter-
national. 

A demonstration protesting 
Smith's visit to the U.S. will be 
held before the luncheon in 
front of the hotel. 

Smith has been in the U.S. 
since Saturday at the invitation 
of27 U.S. Senators. SenatorS.!. 
Hayakawa (R.Calif.) signed 

the letter which expressed the 
idea that since anti-Smith 
spokespersons have been in the 
country recently stating their 
views, Smith shquld be able to 
do so also. 

A secretary in Senator 
Hayakawa's San Diego office 
said the letter does not, 
however, represent support for 
the government of Rhodesia. 

The Patriotic Front, led by 
Soviet and Cuban backed 
Joshua Nkomo and Robert 
Mugabwe, has been fighting the 
Smith government for six 
years. In March of this year, an 
interim government of Smith 
and three blacks was formed to 
effect a transition to black 
majority rule. This govern-

the Federation will protest 
Saturday against Smith's

against the "conservative

The fire department is 
"concerned with that particu-

unfinished condominiums on 
Gilman Drive) said Hunter,

UCSD Extension Moves 
By Judy Walton 

stair Writer 
UC San Diego Extension is on 

the move .. . 
This weekend , extension 

personnel will be making the 
move to tbeir new facilities, 
located at 9600 N. Torrey Pines 
Road, at the stoplight north of 
Muir College. 

Monday, UCSD Extension 
will open the doors of its new 
offices to professionals, lay-
men, students and all those 
with interests ranging from 
American Indians to black 
holes, quarks and quasars. 

Sue Pond rom , public infor-

mation representative _at the 
Extension office , explained 
some of the reasons for the 
move. 

"The new buildings are more 
accessible for the public, have 
more metered parking spaces 
available for those registering 
or attending, and eliminate 
overcrowded conditions that 
exist in our office right now," 
said Pondrom. The' parking 
spaces will be monitored by 
short-term meters only, tit"" 
eliminating the po sibility of 
UCSD students parking there 
for the day, she said. 

"The new registration facil-
ities will be much lareer," said 

Pond rom , " and better able to 
accomodate the approximately 
40,000 enrollments per year. 
Our major function is to erve 
the San Diego public who hav 
been taking our continuing 
education courses for over 61 
years." 

Pond rom described the new 
complex as a ring of five 
b lildings surrounding a sixth 
building, called the " common 
facilities building." The regis-
, r tion hnWdUla will make up 
the southeast comer of the ring 
- " the most visible and 
acce sible area." The north-
ernmost part of the ring will

c mmon Sense? A Smoker? 
"Officer, arrest that man!" 

barb the shrill voice of a bitchy 
noD-smoker, "be's smoking." 

"You're under arrest," snaps 
the officer, "for amokiq at a 
pubUc concert." He proceeds to 
handcuff the offender. 

"You can't arrest me," 
protests the criminal. "Smok-
Ing is le,al at this kind of 
concert." 

"No it isn't!!" replies the 
sbrew, and the scene quickly 
degenerates into an argument 
over wbat type of music is being 
played. 

Suddenly a calm, ,olden-

voiced radio announcer inter-
rupts the frenzied icene: 

"That', the way it would be 
UDder proposition five .... What 
California does not need Is 
another restrictive law dic-
tating bebavior whicb is best 
loverned by common sense .... 
Join Californians for Common 
Sense, wbo paid for tbis 
moment of sanity. Vote no on 
proposition five. 

Sanity? Common Sense? 
Wbat evil -forces dare violate 
sanity and common sense.? 

The answer is provided in 
another such commercial: Tbe 
Re,ulators. "What will The 

Regulators relulate next?" 
Iiqs the No-On--Flve Vocal 
Quartet in one radio adver-
tisement. RUIIIIing in the park? 
Whistlinc after dark? 

This Instantiy conJures up 
images of drooling activists 
Ikulking tbe baUs of tbe 
legislature, waitinl for a 
cbance to regulate yet another 
aapect of our lives. 

Of course this need not be. 
Backed by m1Ilions of tobacco 
dollars, Califomlans for Com-
mon Sense(CCS) halgooe to 
,reat leqths to save us from 
The Regulators. 

A vote uainst 

five, says CCS, is a vote against 
b.~rotber~tics.Av~tory 
for the peopIe,lO to speak. 

But wblcb people? I don't 
smoke. Proposition five would 
not complicate my We at aU. 
What bave I to pin by its 
defeat? 

The answer, I presume, is one 
of priDciple. I mutt not stand 
idly by wbile by brother 
smoker:s are deprived of their 
basic rights. After all, once The 
Regulators. are finished with 
smokers, tbey migbt come 
after me. 

But I aeriously wonder wboae 
basic rights are being violated. 
PropOSition five would not 
outlaw smoking. But iD its 
ab8enee, any smoker bas the 
power to restrict my bresthing. 
Who'. screwiq whom? 

In fact, proposition five does 
not really constitute a serious 
infringement OD personal 
freedom. Convenience, how-
ever, is another matter. 'The 
law would seriously incon-
venience smokers. 

And while CalifomiaD8 can 
happily endure earthquakes, 
smog and freeways, they 

~Iancb a~ the thought ot being 
lDconveruenced. To pass propo-
sition rive would be like 

outiawiq McDonald's. Beyond 
the pale. 

But, buman rights aside, CCS 
argues that this is an issue 
whlcb is best governed by 
common sense. 

Really? Does this mean that 
tboee with enough common 
sense to have started smoking 
will have enougb common 
sense not to smoke? 

I just don't buy it. 
And I don't buy the idea that 

smoking up a room is a basic 
buman right. 

And I don't buy the vicious 
image of non-smokers pre-
sented in CCS advertisements. 
. And finally, I refuse·to play 
lOto the bands of an industry 
whose human rights ltafJCe 
maaks a total disregard for the 
health of California's 20 million 
citizena - smokers and non-
smokers. 

Proposition five is labeled the 
"Clean Indoor Air Act" and not, 
as some assert, the "No-
Smoking Initiative." It is a . 
serious statement on behalf ot 
non-smokers, and it deserves 
serious attention. 

Don't let the media blitz 
intimidate you. You can have a 
say in determining what kind of 
air you breathe. Don't waste it. 

Dismissal Autocratic 
Josie FOUlks' dismissal goes 

beyond a personnel matter. The 
way in which she was dismissed 
is part and parcel of the campus 
decision-making process and, 
therefore, affects all students. 
In the guise of following 
decision-making procedures, 
the administration is simply 
justifying autonomous deci-
sions. This can in no way be 
considered to be in the best 
interests of students or the 

c~mpus community. 
The occurences surrounding 

the Day Care Program on 
campus vividly illustrate the 
attempts to justify autocratic 
decisions. From the day of the 
child care center's inception in 
1971, the administration has 
been firm In its opposition to the 
university participation in this 
vital campus service. In spite of 
the fact that the availability of 
child care has afforded genera-
tions of students the oppor-
tunity to matriculate for the 
first time, Chancellor McElroy 

wa~ still in opposition to it. 
When popular support meant 
the retention of this program 
through the annual budget 
crisis, more drastic measures 
were tak~n by the adminis-
tration. Tw years ago, even 
though the campus rejected 
state funds for child care, the 
~m s rvived. The more 

I 

drastic decision came last 
spring, however , with the 
Chancellor'S intention to close 
the center. 

The campus is fully aware of 
the popular support to maintain 
the child care program which 
culminated in the arrest of 
twenty-two demonstrating 
students and public embar-
rassment for the campus. In 
this light, it was less than 
surprising· to find the center's 
director was, for the first time, 
found to be unsatisfactory by 
the administration. Tennina-
tion procedures began almost 
immediately and what began 
as a political decision is now 
being justified in personnel 
jargon - "time card vio-
lations." 

Josie has always been a 
fighter for what she believes is 
right. Thus, she has cbosen to 
fight this unfair termination. 
Being represented by AFSCME 
local 2068, Josie is appealing 
her termination to a "griev-
ance committee." 

• After fourteen and a half 
hours of testimony the campus 
awaits the committee's recom-
mendation to the Ch.!mcellor. 
Whether or not the committee 
will judge this case fairly and

Technical Skills Losing Value 
By AI Goodman 

Paeifle News Serviee 
Ron Cbecchi is part of a 

national dilemma. 
A 34-year-old butcber at a 

large Safeway supermarket in 
San Francisco, Checchi 
learned his trade after years of 
studious apprenticesbip to his 
tather, Hugo. Today, Ron 
Checchi runs pre-cut portions 
of beef through a saw and 
reflects on all the Intricate 
butchers' skilis be knows and 
never uses. 

(AI Goodman writes on educa-
tion for PNS. This article is part 
ot PNS' continuing coverage on 
the trends reshaping America's 
economy.) 

"We were once judged by 
skills, but skills don't matter 
anymore," be says. "Anybody 
can be trained in seven or eigbt 
months to run meat through the 
saw." 

Across town, Hugo Checchi, 
61, still works behind the meat 
counter for a small independent 
grocer. And he still carves by 
hand with almost surgical 
precision the buge carcasses of 
beet that hang in the meat 
locker. 

" Less skills are required in a 
chain outfit," says Hugo. 
"They get equal pay, but they 
know less." 

Yet most butchers, these 
days, are hired by chain stores, 
not the small independents. 
And butchers are not an 
isolated breed in the labor 
market. 

Throughout America , the 
need for skilled workers is on 

Letters 

the decline as Jobs requiring 
little or no skills are on the rise. 
It is a result of radical and 
immutable changes occuring in 
the U.S. economy - changes 
which some economists and 
educators predict could lead to 
massive dissatisfaction and 
social upheaval across the 
board of the U.S. labor force. 

As American industry con-
tinues to automate and export 
both skilled and unskilled 
manufacturing jobs, service 
sector jobs continue to expand 
and fill the gap. The Con-
gressional Joint Economic 
Committee predicted ' earlier 
this year that by 1985, up to 80 
percent of the U.S. workforce 
would be employed in the 
service sector, where skill 
requirements are at a mini-
mum and there are fewer labor 
unions to protect wages. 

The Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics predicts that the fastest 
growing job slots Cor the years 
ahead will be for dental 
hygienists, flight attendants, 
computer programmers, 
teacher's aides and realtors -
none of which requires a college 
education. 

While not all service sector 
employment is unrewarding or 
underpaid, the statistics show 
that in general these jobs are 
characterized by low wages, 
little or no security or benefits, 
and little room for career 
advancement. 

Some educators are con-
vinced that the trend in the job 
market away from jobs re-
quiring skills and education has 

Who Needs Greeks? 
Editor: 

Even just a little discrimi-
nation - just like just a little 
pregnancy - is something to 
worry about. Do we want it on 
campus? Specifically, do we 
want Greek-letter fraternities 
or sororities respectively 
restricting their memberships 
to male or female students? Do 
we want societies which take in 
only whites, or only blacks - or 
which, though nominally open 
to people of all races, speci-
fically support the N.A.A.C.P., 
the Arab League, or the White 

Citizens' Councils? In fact, 
what is the constitutional 
legality of such societies in the 
America of 1978? 

In a good university we 
should rub shoulders , and 
minds, with all sorts of people: 
scientists, comrriuniljts, gen-
tiles, musicians, blacks, quar 
terbacks, homosexuals, politi-
cal science majors , Nisei , 
cheerleaders, jews - even 
editors! Not just Greek-letter 
siblings.

Your Smoke, My Cancer 
Mr. Burke, you're a bit confused. As a person in favor of 

Proposition 5, I am not out to deprive you of your right to smoke. If 
you want to smoke in your home, in your car, or outdoors, that is 
your right as far as I'm concerned. 

On the other hand, I feel it should be my right to breathe non-
carCinogenic air in public buildings. People who smoke in 
restaurants, theatres, markets, etc. , are exercising not a rigbt, 
but a privilege that bas been bought by the powerful tobacco lobby. 

I do confess that there are certain conditions where smoking 
should be expected, such as at concerts and in bars. If Prop. 5 
doeso't make exceptions for some of these situations, I am quite 
sure not too many people will suffer. Laws are frequently Ignored 
when the social context calls for It. (For example, pot isn't any 
more legal at concerts than anywhere else but that doeso't stop 
people from smokiq it.) If ~ go to places where cigarettes are 
regularly smoked, let that be my choice, and I will not curse the 
smoke. 

If, Indeed, you enjoy smoking, consider yourself lucky that you 
"!laintain the right to smoke cigarettes at all . Lesser carcinogens 
like cyclamates, tris, and saccharin have been effectively banned 
or restricted in this country. And cigarettes dOll't even have any 
useful purpose. They only bave their lobby. 

Some day I may ask you to put out your cigarette (most likely in 
a public building) . I really shouldn't be forced to ask and it's a bit 
selfish of you to suuest I move. I won't be trying to deprive you of 
your right, but as long as we are forced to breathe air in order to 
stay alive, I would like mine to be as clean as possible. That is my 
right .

Treaty Talks Begin 
Israel, Egypt Could Sign In Two Months 

treaty between tile Jewish state 
and the DlOIt populoul of its 
Arab neiebbonr. 

KKK Goes to 
New Hampshire 

WASHINGTON (AP) - E-
gypt and Israel beian Bela-
t1atiODI Thunclay to draw up a 
peace treaty that President 
Carter said moat ultimately be 
broadened to include all Arab 
parties to the Middle Ea.t 
conOict. 

"The United States i. com-
mitted, without reservation, to 
seeing this process throuth 
until each party is at peace with 
all the others," Carter said at 
an opening ceremony at the 
White House. 

A statement iaued at the end 
of the day said "good Pl"Olfess" 
was made, botb in separate 
meeting. Secretary of State 
Cyrua R. Vance held with the 
two delegatioD8 and in three-
way talks. 

Tbe negotiations, whicb are 
expected to last for up to two 
weeks, resume Friday 
morning. 

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - The 
leader of one of the largest 
chapters of the Ku Klux Klan 
says that he's starting a major 
recruiting drive in New Hamp-
shire because "the Seabrook 
nuclear plant is the kind of issue 
that will draw people to the 
Klan." 

"We're going to Seabrook to 
support the constructions work-
ers because nobody else is 
lcJ&king out for their interests," 
said William Wilkinson, the 
imperial wizard of the Invisible 
Empire of the Knights of the Ku 
Klux Klan. 

In a telephone interview 
Tuesday from his headquarters 
in Denham Springs, La . , 
Wilkinson said he will hold a 
march or a rally at the Sea-
brook construction site Satur-
day afternoon. 

Wilkinson said he had not 
completed pJans for t¥ event 
but said, ". expect quite a 
turnout. " 

The Klan leader said his trip 
to New Hampshire should 
generate many new members 
and promised to " return as 

Oem. Leaders 
Pandering to 
Gays-Briggs 

SACRAMENTO (AP) -
State Sen. John Briggs accused' 
a who's who list of Democrats 
Wednesday of using "scare 
tactics" to defeat his anti-
homosexual teacher initiative. 

"We are a victim of misre-
porting by the press and of 
scare tactics by the opposition 
and by certain politicians who 
are pandering to the homosex-
ual crowd for cash or votes, " 
the Fullerton Republican said. 

He listed Gov . Edmund 
Brown Jr., Assembly Speaker 
Leo McCarthy and a number of 
other prominent Democrats 
among those he said were 
" pandering" but refused to 
include former Republican 
Gov. Ronald Reagan , who also 
opposes the Briggs measure. 

• 'Nobody is gOing to convince 
me that Ronald Reagan is going 
to put h ~sexual rights over 
parents':i hts," Briggs said at 
a Capitol ss conference. 

Briggs a so: 
- Que§Uoned whether Rea-

. gan had approved a recent 
statemtnt announcing his 
oppositi 'lq to the initiative, 
propositoi 6 on the November 
ballot. An aide said Reagan 
had. 

- De ,l ed he was being 
investigEt in connection with 
prepaid health care plans and 
suggested Brown might be 
behind news reports that the 
Internal Revenue Service and 
the FBr were looking into 
Briggs' and Democratic Lt. 
Gov. Mervyn Dymally's busi-
ness dealings. 

often as necessary until the 
Klan has a strong foothold in 
the state." 

"New Hampshire is ripe for a 
Klan membership drive," 
Wilkinson said, "and I won' t 
leave the state without forming 
a Klavern chapter. " 

Wilkinson said confusion 
over the exact plans was due to 
a lack of information on what 
type of official permits or 
permission is required to hold a 
rally in Seabrook. 

" If • have to go in bare-
handed. will hold the rally," 
Wilkinson said. ". don't intend 
to be kept out by any ordi-
nances." 

Marshall Cobleigh, top aide 
to Gov. Meldrim Thomson, an 
outspoken supporter of the 
pJant , said he hoped any 
demonstration by the Klan 
would be lawful. 

Cobleigh said the governor's 
office is " not out seeking the 
Klan's support, but anyone has 
a right to express their opinion 
as long as they do it in a lawful 
manner." 

Delegates from the two 
countries then walked side by 
side across Pennsylvania 
Avenue to Blair House where, 
in a second-floor library, they 
started to explore terms for a 

Tben Secretary of State 
Cyrus R. Vance and other U.S. 
officials met with the Israeli 
delegation. After luncb, a 
separate U.S.-Egyptian meet-
ing was set up, with the three 
sides getting together again in 

Killer Satellite 
PASADENA (AP) - Ameri-

can space agency officials 
flatly rejected a publi.bed 
report Thursday that a re-
search satellite may have been 
attacked and crippled by a 
Soviet "killer satellite." 

"No one direcUy involved 
with conduct of the project has 
considered the killer satellite 
theory," said Gene Giberson of 
the Jet Propuision Laboratory. 

"The evidence just supports 
the very straigbt-forward idea 
of a sbort circuit in the on-board 

. power system." 
Giberson is project manager 

for the 3 lIJ-montb-old Seasat-A 
mission~hicb was to ~x!J11ine 

the world's oceans on an 
unprecedented scale. 

The Cocoa, Fla., newspaper 
Today said in Tbursday's 
edition that a killer satellite 
was among pouibllities dia-
cuued by scientists trying to 
diagnose the problem. 

JPL's Frank Bristow said 
there's no evidence to support 
the theory since "all the data 
we have indicates an internal 
short-circuit. It bad to be a 
short to drain tile power that 
fast." 

. NASA trouble-shooters, 
meanwhile, were sWl trying to 
revive the $75 million sajeUitfo.

The hope is that a treaty can 

be completed within two 
monthl. 

The negotiations, ' growiq 
out of last mooth'. Camp David 
accords, deal with details of 
Israeli withdrawal from the 
Sinai Desert. security arraqe-
ments and an exchan,e of 
ambassadors. 

Mucb of the Arab world has 
condemned Sadat for what 
could turn out to be a separate 
peace with Israel. Carter also 
has felt the sting of tbis 
criticism. 

In his welcoming remarkB, 
the president underscored a 
commitment to a comprehen-
sive settlement and to tbe 
welfare of Palestinian Arabi 
living under Israeli control. 

The goal, Carter said, is "to 
make peace and dignity a 
reality for all the people of the 
Middle East ." He invited 
Jordan, the Palestinians living 
on tile West Bank of the Jordan 
River and in Gaza, and "oth-
ers" to join the peace process. 

The alternative, Carter said, 
"is drift, sta,emate, eternal 
emnity and perhaps even 
another war." 

Moabe Dayan, the I.raeli 
foreip minister, stood to the 
presJdent'. rieht. 

To Carter's left in the East 
Room stood Kamal Hassan Ali, 
the new Egyptian defense 
minister in Sadat's reshuffled 
"peace" govenunent . 

Dayan, 'peaking briefly, said 
Israel hopes the way is DOW 
clear for conclud.ini a peace 
treaty. There were Db apparent 
political message. in the 
fonner general'. remarks. 

But Ali underscored the need 
for "a comprehensive peace 
which insures the fulfillment of 
the legitimate rigbts of the 
Palestinian people and enables 
them to playa constructive role 
in a peaceful Middle East." 

He said the 40 miUion Egyp-
tian people hope the two frame-
workB constructed at Camp 
David - one setting up peace 
with Israel and the other 
negotiations over the future of 
the West Bank and Gaza -
"will serve as a solid founda-
tion for a compreheJljive peace 
to be built in good faith by all 
parties." 

The talks are being held 
under U.S. sponsorship, and 
are to be conducted in the same 
strict secrecy that shrouded the 
negotiations at Camp David.

Profs Disagree o~ Study Methods 

Bad News, Though: Most Say 'Go to Lecture' 
By Erie HarpeD 

If you are planning on 
obtaining a maximum score on 
upcomlDl midtenns and finals. 
you .hould either; cram, re-
read all the material covered or 
go to the movies the niJbt 
before &be exam. If the three 
sound like an unlikely com-
bination. it's becauae varioua 
UCSD professors interviewed 
on teItI and test-taldni proce-
dures hold differing view-
points on optimum student 
study methods. 

The professors, however, do 
agree on certain methods of 
testing and study procedures. 
They agree that on all te.ts, 
there are differing levels of 
difficulty in the queationiDJ. 
Harry M(ansiqer. professor of 
psycbology, desipa his ques-
tions on five succeeding levels 
of difficulty ranging from 
recall of simple textbook 
material to difficult conceptual 
questions that only the "student 
striving for an A can answer." 
AI Shenk, professor of mathe-
matics designs his questions on 
three levels of difficulty. The 
first level consists of routine 
problems, similar to those 
assigned for homework. Second 
level problems are similar 
conceptually to homework 
problems, but succeed them in 
level or difficulty. Third level 
problems, which can comprise 
as much as 20"10 of the test 
questions, require what Shenk 
terms "fresb thinking." In 
other wordll, application of 
previously learoed materi8I to 
new concepts. 

Another two professors 
interviewed, Leigb Clark of the 
Chemistry ~epartment, and 
Johnathan Saville of the 
Literature department, design 
test questions similar to those 
previously mentioned, but 
differing in purpose. Saville's 
tests for comparative litera-
ture contain two types of 
questions. One is objective, to 
measure whether or not the 
student has done the reading 
and attended the lectures. The 
other type is subjective, to 
determine if the student has 
learned to analyze and under-
stand the material. Clark's 
tests also contain two types of 
problems, one where the 
student wouldn't have had to 
apply himself at all to miss, 
and the other type to test if he 
understands the meaning of the 
date and can put it to use. 

Preparing for the exam is a 
subject that elicited some 
disagreement between the 
professors. Munsinger , a 
clinical psycbologist, is famili -
ar with the psychology of 
learning. He recommends that 
a student read the material 
before the lecture, attend 
lectures, correlate data from 
the textbook to the lecture 
material and "cram!" 

According to Mun.inler, 
cramming is an effective study 
technique even if the' student 

ha~ already learned the materi-
al during the quarter. He also 
suggested that students "write 
problems down and attempt to 
answer them." By te.ting 
tbemselves, the student will 
become aware of bis famili-
arity with the material and at 
the same time "protect re-
trieval. " 

Professors Clark and Shenk 
aJree on one essential method 
of prepariDi forexarna: Devote

mance, according to Clark. He 
feels that "students wbo do 
cram will bog down. The next 
day they might forget it all." 

way, he will not be able to lear:n 
what the instructor feels IS 
important, and which material 
is likely to appear on the exam. 
Finally, the student should 
concentrate on the test; "Con-

problema that are assigned, 
and the material from the 
lectures. The two professors 
allo said that for their specific 
fields, the student can best 
learn material by doing prob-
lems and followin, examples. 
WorkinJ out the examples in 
the book and foliowlng the steps 
to see if your work is correct 
can also prove helpful. Clark 
summed up proper study 
procedures when he said, "It all 
comes down to working or not 
working." 

An essential aspect of study 
for literature tests, according 
to Saville, is re-reading se-
lected material. "The student 
should read material at least 
twice," he feels , so that he can 
grasp both the theme of the 
work and an analytic under-
standing of it. "Many students 
skip over certain works. They 
don't try to understand what 
they read," he says.

A technique recommended 
by Clark for maximizing one's 
efficiency on a test is relax-
ation. "Go to the movies the 
night before the exam." This 
technique can prove useful for 
well-prepared pre-med stu-
dents who let the pressures of 
upcoming chemistry exams 
interfere with their perfor-

Saville also outlines pro-
cedures for getting "bad 
grades ." Skimming is one 
method. If the student does not 
try to understand what be 
reads, it is likely that he will 
miss the entire point of the 
passage . Also, the student 
shoulc,t skip the lectures. In this

YEAR. 
If you're a-junior or a senior majoring in math, physics or 

engineering, the Navy has a program you should know about. 
It's called the Nuclear Propulsion Officer Candidate-

Collegiate Program (NUPOC-C for short) and if you qualify, 
you can earn as much as $650 a month right through your 
senior year. Then after 16 weeks 'of Officer Candidate School, 
you'll receive an additional year of advanced technical 
education. This would cost you thousands in a civilian school, 
but in the Navy, we pay you. And at the end of the year of 
training, you'll receive a $3,000 cash bonus. 

It isn't easy. There are fewer than 400 openings and only 
one of every six applicants will be selected. But if you make 
it, you'll have qualified for an elite engineering training 
program. With unequaled hands-on responsibility, a $24,000 
salary in four years, and gilt-edged qualifications for jobs 
in private industry should you decide to leave the Navy 
later. (But we don't think you'll want to.) 

Ask your placement officer to set up an interview with a 
Navy representative when he visits the campus on Oct _ 17-18,

By Jamel va 8eoyoc 
Everyone wbo bas ever been 

throop Revelle Orientation . 
baa beard that the dormitories 
tbere were named for ",blps of 
d1acovery. " Since lOme of the 
names, however, are not well-
known , many have a.ked 
tbemselves what tbese sbips 
actually were. 

In searcb of an answer, we 
strolled down to the Revelle 
Provost's Office. The veteran 
workers there proved to be 
almost as. ignorant as we, but 
were able to refer us to Scripps' 
Institution of Oceanolr~phy 
Archivist Betty Shor, who has 
documented the history of 
Revelle as well as of Scripps. 

Most of the sbips are or were 
oceanographic research ves-

centuries of questionable 
renown outside oceanographic 
circles . Some believe that 
names such as " Cballenger", 
"Galathea" , and " Meteor"

none of the Revelle donns were

British Rock · Meets Black Music 
By Ted Navia .... 

AI18Edl ... 
In a amall Idtcbell located 

above the Roxy Theatre (an old 
nelgbborbood film boule that'. 
been converted Into a .man 
concert ball), aancly-balred and 
fair-a1dnDed Kim Simmonds 
recHnes in a chair and lips from 
a styrofoam cup contalninl 
Jack Daniels and Perrier. 
Simmonda, the lead guitarist 
for the lelendary Savoy Brown, 
who at this date remaina one of 
the best of the Britisb blues 
guitar stylists, is recounting 
how he first came upon black 
American music. 

" I guess it happened some-
time when I was a kid, in tny 
teeDS," be says after a casual 
sip from his cup with a relaxed 
cockney accent that' s un-
usually mild-mannered for a 
noted rock star. "I'd been into 
rock and roll on the guitar, 
y'know, and that later turned 
into rhythm and blues. I'd 
sort've made the transition 
from the Comets to a James 
Brown thing. A sbort time later, 
I'd heard some blues records by 
Otis Rush, Muddy Waters and 
other Chicago blues guys, and 
from there it was all over with. 
I'd made up my mind that I had 
to play guitar like Otis Rush or 
Jimmy Rogers , who played for 
Muddy Waters, and that the 
band I was going to be in had to 
play in the Chicago s tyle. 
Luckily for us, the audiences 
seemed to be ready (or some-
thing different. We formed the 
Savoy Brown Blues Band, and 
soon we had records out and 
commenced on tours in the 
Sta tes .. .. " 
. Savoy Brown gained Ameri-

can notoriety around '67-69, 
then the height of the white 
blues boom in rock music . 

Their tours of the U.S. took 
them to sma1l clube, sweaty 
.,.ycbedeUc ballrooms, mas-
.ive iDdoor auditoriums, skat-
Ing rinks and the llke, with their 
audience IrowiDI ar8dually by

Brown at that time didn't have 
a breaktbrougb bit sinlle. 
Thougb the band didn't suffer 
from lack of work, Savoy 
Brown remained on the lower 
tier, a band with a strong 
following that didn't quite have 
the commercial clout to push 
them over the top. 

Simmonds, haan't let the lack 
of mass recognition ,et to him, 
however, "[ know it'd be very 
nice to play to very large 
audiences and get the kind of 
airplay others get," he says, 
pouring more Perrier into his 
cup," but I'm happy to play, 
really. If a song of ours gets 
pulled oU the new album 
(Savage Re,um) as a single 
and becomes a hit , great, 
fantastic, but I can't sit down 
and write a ' hit,' something 
that deliberate. I'd rather write 
a song just for the feeling and 
hope others find something 
they like in it. I'm not puttinR 
down songwriters who do make 
a living writing very com-
mercial material. It ' s bard 
work. How does someone sit 

down and write sornetbina for 
Sinatra? You have to bave a 
feeling for that kind of work, 
you have to be into It. I admire 
people who can do that. 

"For myself, from the way I 
approach my guitar playing the 
the way I write sonp, it has to 
be aometbin& I feel and the 
audfence attracted to it, 
wbetber lal"le or smaU, makes 
me happy. Basically, I auess 
you could say that I'm bappy to 

play for anyone who wants to 
listen." 

The latest version of Savoy 
Brown (featured on Sava.e 
ReUlnl) is a trio, and the music 
is more bard rock and less 
bluesy. In performance, it was 
apparent that Simmonds isn't 
as comfortable in the new set as 
he'd like to be. Simmonda lacks 
the outright egomania of Ted 

NUle~t, the fluency of Robin 
Trower, and the bite of Ritchie 

Blackmore to maintain the 
spotlipt as a constant soloist, 
and most of the new ma terial is 
fairly uridistinguished as well, 
resembling any number of 
heavy metal tunes that one can 
hum from memory though not 
being able to name either tiUe 
or artist. Simmonds remains, 
however, a superlative blues 
guitarist, with the three tradi-
tional solos easily bei!lg the

Bowie as Inspiration 
By Tim Maekeule 
eo.&rI ... _E ...... 

One of the moat arre8tin, 
801118 from the 8ummer of '71 

had to be Gerry Rafferty's 
"Baker Street." Along with 
MickJauer'shootiqon "Miss 
You," the seductivel8xopbODe 

riff contained in "Baker 
Street" appeared to be in the 
air everywhere you turned. 
And while I was captivated by 
RaUerty's soul·searchiq piece 
of music, the sax riff haunted 
me with a deja·vu type feelinl. 
It didn't take me 10111 to filUre 
out my dilemma, however. 

The in8piration was pure 
David Bowie. 

Takinl nothiq away from 
Rafferty, the "Baker Street" 
riff merely serves to emphasize 
the importance of Bowie's 
contribution to the pop music 
world. The man Is an innovator 
with foreai,bt rarely matched 
by his peeR!. And be doesn't 
stand still. 

Almost as soon as he reached 
his disco/soul 80und with the 
fJ8x·laden YOUD' Americus 
LP, Bowie was off again, 
transformed by some internal 
pacemaker that ·keeps him 
from staying in one place 
mU8ically too 10111. He has gone 
off to become a Thin White 
ijuke and a Mall' Who Fell To 
Earth, playing futuristic 
techno-rock with a being called 
Eno. But in his wake, fellow 
mUsicians have borrowed from 
his talents, some prostituting 
them whife others, Uke Raf-
ferty, using the Bowie sound to 
fully complement their own 
unique music. Indeed, there are 
probably as many Bowie-
influenced rockers today as 
there are Elvis impersonators. 

Bowie's new album, Sta,e, a 
live LP from his 1978 tour.

Arthur Wagner Stars 
In Two UCSD Recitals 

By William Gibson 
The UCSD Theater's first 

production of the year is a 
faculty recital, performed by 
the head of Actor Training Dr. 
Arthur Wagner , of Anton 
Chekhov's On the Harmfulness 
of Tobacco and Samuel Beck-
ett's Krapp's Last Tape. 

These pieces were selected 
by Dr. Wagner and are directed 
and produced (in the sense of 
technical effects) by himself. 
He is also the sole performer. 
The problems of accomplishing 
such a feat proved difficult for 
Wagner, also interesting and 
instructive for him as a Trainer 
of Actors . After seeing the 
performance last Saturday, I 
can say that they are likewise 
difficult and interesting to 
experience. 

Krapp, it seems, is an old 
man who drinks a lot, eats only 
bananas, listens to, records, 
and transcribes tapes at night, 
thougb not necessarily in that 
order. His confusion is the basis 
of the play's action. When I 
talked to Dr. Wagner about 
Krapp's Last Tape, his most . 
frequent outside references 
were to music. He feels that 
viewing Krapp's is "like 
listening to a fine piece of 
music. You do.n't get it all in the 
first hearing," that the sensu-
ous experience is the most 
important factor in getting the 
most out of the piece. "Tbe 
deeper meaning, " he said, 
" that's for people to worry 
about afterwards ." If so, the 
physical experience of Krapp's 
is more akin to listening to a 
Bartok Suite, or Kin, Crimson, 

---- ~ ----

if you prefer, than any of the 
more anodyne pieces that 
might come to mind. The action 
is filled with excruciating 
pauses , interrupted (I say 
interrupted because the play 
often seems more pause than 
action) by convulsive move-

ments and absent-minded 
wandering. A large part of the 
monologue is a tape of young 
Krapp maundering discon-
nectedly about his loves , 
childhood etc., interspersed 
with Beckettian anti-profundi-

Chekhov blends farce and 
reallam in presenting us with 
an uxorious "scientist" lec-
turing, ostensibly, on "the 
harmful eHects of tobacco." It 
becomes clear that this lec-
turer is plagued by problems of 
a more personal nature. His 
ludicrous digressions from the 
subject of tobacco are amusing, 
poignant, and perhaps in-
structive to human beings 
attending an institution largely 
concerned with the pursuit of 
absolute knowledge.

that the character II a real 
entity In a real world (that of 
the play) , and tries, rather 
than attempt to Interpret and 
thus bias the piece, to assume

Dr. Wagner's characterization 
of Krapp is remarkably simian, 
as well as decrepit; both are 
appropriate for a man wbo II 
more a tired, confused animal 
than anything e.... He feels 
that the notion of using a tape 
for most of the monologue, thus 
practically altowing for a 
dialogue between old Krapp 
and his younger self, works. 
I'm not so sure; the long 
periods in which Krapp is 
slumped over his desk listening 
become distracting; one begins 

to compIaiD about Beckett's 
work I'8tber tban itl presenta-
tion bere. Dr. W qner is faitbful 
to the text, to Knpp .. a 
created man. He went 81 far

five minutes durInI the per-
formance to unwind a tangled 
tape. He said Monday, "I could

that would bave been diabonest

Arthur Waper baa tried, and 
largely succeeded, to do a 
difficult tbing, to direct himself 
in two various pieces of modern 
theater. The discipline was 
entirely Ilia own and, with the 
exception of some advice from 
colleagues, so were all the 
histrionics. One does not go to 
the plays entirely out of 
admiration for the artist; the 
pieces tbemselves must be

Could you be 
a nuclear expert? . 

(If so, you could earn more than 
$600 a month your Senior year.) 

Even if you're a Junior engineering or physical science 
major, it's not too early to start thinking about your career. 
And if you think you 've got what it tokes to become an expert 
in nuclear power, the Navy has a special program you should 
look into right away. 

Why right away? Because if you're selected, we'll pay you 
more than $600 a month during your Senior year. (If you are 
presently a Senior, you can still join the program.) 

Whot then? After graduation, you'll get nuclear training 
from the men who run more than 70% of the nuclear reactors 
in the count')' - Navy men. And an opportunity to apply that 
training in the Navy's nuclear-pawe ~ fleet. 

OnIY-Qbout 200 men will be chas r this program this 
year. So, if you're interested, call:

opinion. 

.Bo\Wie Endures, 
His Rock Prevails 
(C.L from pap I) 
would be a great introduction 
for anyone wbo has not followed 
him closely before _ SIa,e 
incorporates mWlic from four 
of Bowie's previous records, 
from TIle RJse and Fall of ZiuY 
S&ardusl to Heroes, his most 
recent studio LP. 

The most immediate clue to 
the aJbum's worth is that it is 
culled from one of the finest 
stage sbows seen in recent 
years. The sound was of good 
quality, the performance was 
inspired and the format was 
both intriguing and daring . 
Many thought Bowie would 
never tour again given the 
recent direction of his music . 
But as he usually does, he 
proved his critics to be fools 
with a well·integrated set, 
mixing the techno-rock and the 
Zilly-rock with aplomb. 

The opening side of the two-
record set begins with Ziggy's 
"Hang On To Yourself," a 
frenetic rocker in the grand 
Bowie tradition, and continues 
through the rest of bis early 
works that he performed on this 
tour ("Ziggy Stardust," "Five 
Years," "Soul Love," "Star"). 
Side two is Station to Station 
time , 'while record two is 
replete with Low and HeroeS 
material. 

The structure of the Stage LP 
is worth noting, for with the 
exception oC his Ziggy set, 
Bowie's concerts were not 
arranged as they were on the 
album. He attempted to mix up 
the different period pieces in 
concert. while on tbe album 

-

they are completely struc-
tured, like assorted time 
capsules thrown together for a 
definJtive statement. 

It makes me wonder what 
Bowie bad in mind. As an artist 
I think Sowie sold-out to 
commercial interests by ar-
ranging his musical selections 
as he did. Obviously the thought 
was "Don't alienate the kids 
with the new material. They 
can still put on side one and play 
it until it's worn througb 
without stopping for Low." As a 
Can who enjoys his new music 
as well, I would have much 
preferred to have heard it as an 
integrated whole. Still , this 
doesn't fault the individual 
musical selections, all of which 
are first·rate . 

What lies ahead for Bowie we 
can only guess. He may have 
created Stage to Simply fulfill a 
contractual obligation or to get 
some pocket money. Maybe 
this is his last hurrah in music 
before attacking the silver 
screen. I doubt it_ Many thought 
the advent of Low was the end 
for Bowie, but he proved them 
wrong. Techno-rock was not 
anti-music . It didn't make 
people watch ten television 
programs simultaneously. 
Suicides-didn't take a dramatic 
upturn . 

While the Elton Johns and 
Alice Coopers come and go in 
the rock music world, David 
Sowie remains . Stage is a 

. testament to that endurance 
and innovation. He is still tops 
in his field.

"Siology of Cancer," a 
course organized by students, 
will be offered in spring quarter 
under the sponsorship of the 
American Cancer Society, the 
UCSD Cancer Center and the 
department of biology . 

A meeting has been sched-

the purpose of drawing up an 
outline for the course. The 
meeting, to be held in room S-
248 of the Basic Sciences 
suilding, is open to stude~ts

ships. Some of the people 
involved with Revelle's found-
ing were closely affiliated with 
Scripps. 

A word about Beagle is in 
order at this point, for like Argo 
it is an exception to the pattern 
of naming dorms after re-
search vessels. The Beagle was 
the ship on which Darwin 
visited the Galapagos where he 
gathered data leading to his 
theory of natural selection. 
That Beagle Hall is an excep-
tion in this manner is fitting, for 
it is like no dorm elsewhere at 
UCSD. Its status as an Inter-
national House makes it a 
"Ship of Discovery" in its own 
right. 

To many, names like Meteor, 
Discovery and Challenger 
possess a pleasant saltiness 
lacking in stuffy, old-fashioned 
ones like "Soyle" or "John· 
son" or "Kennedy". Others, 
however, may wish we had 
gone further as they did at UC 
Irvine, where in a "Middle-
earth" section one may find 
Rivendell, Hobbiton and Misty 
Mountain Halls.

Harriers To Run 
1st Meet Saturday 

By KareD Hueer 
8por1aEdI .... 

On Saturday morning a new UCSD team takes to the fields, this 
time in the fonn of the women's cross p!untry team. The women, 
under the coaching of Graham Parnell, will face Point Lorna and 
Chapman College in a 5,000 meter (3.1 miles) race on the Triton's 
home course in the woods off John Hopkins Drive. 

This is the fint year that UCSD has fielded a separate team for 
women. The program is just getting off the ground and Parnell 
sees it taking "at least two years to build up the team. These are 
the growth yean for our women's program," Parnell added. 
"Some schools don't even have women's teams. " 

To date II women have indicated their interest in participating 
on UCSD's team. "I have absolutely no idea what level our team is 
on or how any of the other teams rate, " commented Parnell . • 'We 
have a good, average team with a strong running background and 
enthusiasm. " 

Bridget Bohan, who has trained for the past two years under 
Parnell, is expected to be one of the teams' stronger runners. 
Debbie Althus, a sophomore who ran with the mens' team last 
year, and Sarah Rawkin, a student from Massachusetts, are also 
expected to turn in good performances. 

Parnell feels that the UCSD athletic program is " unique in its 
position of promoting academic excellence. You can't just have a 
practical approach to sports, it has to be intelligent, too." 

• 'I bring the team my experience," Parnell remarked. "I'm low 
key. This allows the athletes to provide their own freedom of 
determination. If each girlleams to evaluate her own limitations 
and live with them, she will be successful. The girls are going to 
produce by themsel ves. They work-out on their own schedules and 
are already disciplined," said Parnell. 

, 

The girls meet on Saturday mornings at I: 00 at the Coffee Hut 
for what Parnell refers to as a "social work-out." 

"Five days of hard work is enough. On Saturday mornings we 
have a light work-out at eight, return to the Coffee Hut, have 
breakfast together, and listen to a guest speaker," Parnell 
explained.

Sirens Not Titans: Lose 1-0 
By Rebecc:a Ortiz 

The UCSD Women's field 
hockey team's season opened 
on Muir Field October 10, with a 
loss against the Golden West 
Rustlers. 

Despite the loss, UCSD's new 
coach, Jerry Mucha, expressed 
good feelinp about the game. 
"The team played excellently 
against Golden West's very 
experienced team. Golden 
West bas already played five 
games this season and they 
have had a women ' s field 
hockey team for yean." 

.. Altboulh the Tritons are a 
young team," stated Rustler 
coach Dowling, " they played 
very well and really presented 
a challenge to my team. We 
also enjoyed the game very 
much and were very happy to 
play sucb strong opponents." 

The game began with a volley 
which gave the.Rustlers control , 

of the ball. After a strenuous 
effort by the Tritons (who 
prefer to be known as the 
Sirens) , especially Crom re-
turning players Shella O'Brien 
(link) , JiU Pruett (right half) , 
and Amy Cheshire (link) and 
Crom new player Nancy Payne 
(forward), the ball was inter-
cepted. The Tritons played a 
powerful game but were futile 
in their efforts to score. 

Neither team scored until 
minutes into the first half. when 
Rustler Judy Beranek shot the 
ball forward , around the 
Triton's goalie and other team 
members blocking the goal. 
There were no further scores 
during the first balf. 

The second half started with 
more intensity than the first. 
During this time several otber 
Tritons identified themselves 
as outstanding players. Team 

captain Denise Dupre and 
goalie Jeanie Banta blocked 
more than 20 potential goals. 
Jennifer Jobnson (left wing) 
and Mijke Roggenveen (left 
full) , both rookies, also played 
well defensively. 

The game ended with the 
score 1..{1, but both coaches 
expressed satisCaction with 
their teams. Mucha remarked 
that his team played very well . 
" I am very proud of them. A 
team that c an block nine 
potential goals in a row is going 
to have a very good season." 

When asked bow the team felt 
about the game, team captain 
Denise Dupre said, "We made a 
lot of mistakes but it was a good 
game. Now we have to learn 
from those mistakes if we want 
to be a better team. The best 
thing about the game is that I 
enjoyed it." .

Grading Policy 

(Cell&. fnm ..... I) 
centraUng on the test is not the 
best way to learn the material 
of the course," said Saville. 

All professors were in com-
plete agreement on the idea 
that the student should picture 
all the material as a wbole, 
instead of as unrelated sub-
topics. This is not to say that 
Individual aspects shouldn't be 
analyzed, but that they should 
be analyzed, understood, and 
projected into "the big pic-
ture," Shenk said. 

Munsinger suuests "gues-
sing" on objective questions 
that a student really does not 
know bow to answer. He may be 
able to recall some material 
that be had previously read and 
forgotten . Furthermore, out of 

. four objective cboices, such as 
a, b, c, d, two can usually be 
eliminated tbrough rational 
thinking. Tbat leaves two 
answers that can be difficult to 
decide between. Narrowing the 
choices down to those two 
answers can substantially 
increase tbe chances for 
correct guessing. 

"Read over all the questions 
beCore taking the test," said 
Munsinger. "orten tbey (the 
questions) will clue you in once 
you start on the essay section of 
the exam." The student should 
also, "Outline the essay before 
you write on it." The outlme 
should then be used to structure 
the essay. On true/false ques-
tions, MUDsinger said to "use 
your first impressions, then if 
you can't disprove your an-
swer, keep it." 

On the subject of grading, 
Shenk and Clark both ex-
pressed the view that tests 

should be graded, in Shenk's 
words, "qualitatively, not 
quantitatively." Both instruc-
tors prefer to erade approach 
as well as results. For that 
reason, neither teacher gives 
objective or machine scored 
tests. 

Shenk and Clark differ, 
however, in that Clark grades 
on a straight percentage basis, 
wbile Shenk grades on a 
"flexible curve. " Clark does 
reserve the right to assign any 
percentage value to any certain 
test, but describes his grading 
procedure on the whole as 
"business1ike." Sbenk re-
vealed that he gears his tests 
toward instruction during the 
year." As a result, new ideas 
are introduced on the quizzes 
and scores may be lower, but be 
"grades fairly in the end." 

While Clark maintains that 
stressful study techniques are 
not conducive to efficient 
learning and maximum "en-
joyment" of the material, he 
feels that students should take 
note: "If you want to make it in 
the system. you might not want 
to follow what I say. But, 
making it in the system is not 
always something you want to 
do."

highlight of the show. Uke 
other blues greats (Freddie 
King, Rush, Johnny Winter), 
Simmonds combines speed 
with taste , flashiness with 
subtlty, and technique with 
emotion. These three solos 
cause one to wonder why 
Simmonds is bothering with 
hard rock when he excels with 
more traditional blues. Per-
haps someday the audiences 
will be more receptive to what 
Simmonds can do best. In the 
meantime, however, Savoy 
Brown is a band doing its level 
best to make a return onto the 
scene, and they are doing the 
best they can do. The sbow in 
general was a rousing good 
time that was blessedly free of 
the obnoxious hype that makes 
most hard rock concerts 
endurance contests. Wbatever 
the circumstances he's playing -
UJ)cier> it · seem. tbat Kim 
Shnmonds loathes the ide~ of 
giving his audience less than _ 
what he can do. 

The diatJ nclibn between 
Simmonda and the rest of the 
other guitar hotshots in the 
world was clarified simply but 
accurately outside the RoX)' 
Theatre u the Orat show crowd 
was wandering out by a long-
time Savoy Brown fan. 

"The difference," said the 
fan unblushingly, "is that Kim 
Simmonds Is a musician, not a 
rock star."
