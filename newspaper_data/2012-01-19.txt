SURF REPORT

BY LAIRA MARTIN
Associate News Editor

The University of California will ban tobacco use on all 10 campuses by 2014, UC President Mark G. Yudof announced 
in a letter to the chancellors on Jan. 9. The new 
policy, which each committee is responsible for 
creating, would also ban the sale and promotion 

of tobacco products on campus. 
Colleen Stevens, chief of the tobacco 

control branch at the California Department 
of Public Health, emphasized the extent of the 
UC system’s efforts in a Jan. 12 article of the 
Mercury News.

“People have been actively 
working on this for 10 years,” 
Stevens said in the article. “The 
UC system has been very vocal 
about protecting people from 
secondhand smoke.”

According to a Jan. 12 article 
on ABC 7’s website, only 8 percent of UC 
students smoke, while 10 percent of faculty and 
staff smoke. 

Currently, UC campuses already ban 

smoking within 20 feet of buildings, while UC 
San Francisco has banned smoking entirely 
since 2008. UCSD’s current smoking policy, 

first implemented in September 2009, states 
that smoking is banned within 25 feet of all 
buildings. Last year, the UCSD Health Sciences 
campus located in Hillcrest enacted a smoking 
ban on a trial period. 

Yudof ’s new policy would create a blanket 
ban that includes all outdoor areas, including 
RIMAC Field. According to the announcement, 
the ban will be slowly implemented to allow 
smokers to adjust to the ban. The ban will affect 
all students, faculty and staff.

A.S. Council is still trying to fill two 
vacant positions after Associate Vice 
President of Student Organizations 
Lynne Swerhone and Sixth College 
Council president Kristian Castro 
stepped down during Fall Quarter 
2011. A.S. Speaker Ryan O’Rear also 
vacated his position, but the council 
appointed Associate Vice President 
of Diversity Affairs Jesus Romero as 
his replacement during the Jan. 11 
meeting. 

Swerhone resigned from office 
after the Nov. 30 meeting, during 
which council passed the referendum 
allowing students to vote on a possible 
$165 per-quarter student fee increase 
to move UCSD into Division-I 
athletics. 

“I am so deeply disappointed in 
all of you,” Swerhone wrote in her 
resignation letter to the A.S. Council 
listserv. “That was one of the most 
disgusting displays of mindless group-
think I’ve ever seen.” 

Swerhone said she disapproved with 
passing of the D-I athletic referendum 
because students are dropping 
outschool from not being able to afford 
to pay their fees.

Record 60K Freshmen Applicants
BY ZEV HURWITZ
Staff Writer

A record 75,987 students applied to UCSD 
in fall 2011, according to figures released Jan. 12 
by the UC Office of the President. While this is 
an overall increase of nearly 8 percent — with 
freshmen applications jumping 13.8 percent to a 
record 60,819 — transfer applications fell nearly 11 
percent to 15,168 from just over 17,000 a year ago. 

According to a press release issued by UCSD 
spokesperson Christine Clark, the average high 
school GPA of freshmen applicants is 3.76. 
Transfer applicants, largely from community 
colleges, average a 3.3 GPA. UCSD is the third 
most applied-to UC campus for the 2012-13 year, 
trailing UCLA and UC Berkeley.

Applications increased at each of the nine UC 
undergraduate campuses. Overall, the UC system 
saw over 160,000 individual students apply for admission — an all-
time high. 

UCSD Assistant Vice Chancellor and Director of Admissions 
Mae Brown said that, despite the surge in applications, enrollment 
numbers will not be dramatically different in the fall.

“We don’t expect to see a significant change in the enrollment 
target for 2012,” Brown said.  “More students may be admitted 

compared to Fall 2011 but that will not be determined until our 
enrollment target is set for Fall 2012.”

The campus press release reported a total increase of 
2000 applications from African Americans, Latinos and 
Native Americans. This year, for the first time, Latino 
applicants to UC campuses outnumbered whites. UCOP 
Interim Director of Admissions Kate Jeffery said the UC 
system’s new admissions policy was a factor in the rising 
number of minority applicants. This new admissions 
policy — approved by the Board of Regents in 2009 
— no longer requires students to take the SAT Subject 
tests, although SAT I or ACT scores are still required. 
According to the UC website, the change was made to 
increase the pool of high-achieving applicants and the 
tests were deemed to “add little to the prediction of how 
well a student will do at UC.”

Previously, UC was the only system nationwide to 
require the tests.

According to the UCOP release, SAT I and ACT 
scores remained similar to those of last year.

“It is good news for the university to have such significant 
demand from high-achieving California students,” Jeffery said. 
“We’re doing something right in providing an education that 
California students want and their families value.”

Policy gives individual campuses 
ability to set specific guidelines to 
“gradually” become smoke-free in

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

UCSD Professor Leads Search for Famed “God Particle”
BY JAVIER ARMSTRONG
Staff Writer

Scientists led by UCSD physicist and 
professor Vivek Sharma have found potential 
glimpses of the so-called “God particle” — the 
Higgs Boson — and have narrowed the list of 
possible hiding places for the Higgs.

The Higgs Boson, if it exists, would be an 
elementary particle responsible for mass in the 
universe. 

Scientists announced potential glimpses of 
the elementary particle during a special seminar 
at the European Organization for Nuclear 
Research in mid-December.

“I think we are getting very close,” UCSD 
physicist and professor Vivek Sharma said in a 
Dec. 13 msnbc.com article. “We may be getting 
the first tantalizing hints, but it’s a whiff, it’s a 
smell, it’s not quite the whole thing.”

Sharma leads a team of 600 scientists from 
Europe, India, Korea, Brazil and the U.S. at 
CERN. 

The scientists used the Large Hadron 
Collider, the world’s largest high-energy particle 
accelerator. 

An energy particle accelerator creates a 
stable acceleration at constant orbital radius in 
an annual magnetic field.

CERN runs the 17-mile loop buried under 
Switzerland and France. 

Particles in the LHC travel near the speed 
of the light and release large amounts of energy 
created from collision explosions. 

The energy released combines into new 
particles, which sometimes include species like 
the Higgs.

In the past two years, the scientists have 
used the Large Hadron Collider to smash over 
500 trillion protons. 

They recorded the findings with a camera 
capable of capturing 80 million pixels and 1 
billion frames per second in hopes of catching a 
glimpse of the Higgs.

University of Wisconsin-Madison researcher 
Sau Lan Wu said the universe would have 
formed very differently if Higgs Boson was 
nonexistent. 

Scientists believe that the Higgs Boson is the 
reason there is mass.

“It is through the interaction with the Higgs 
Boson that elementary particles acquire their 

masses,” Wu said. “Therefore, without the 
Higgs Boson, quarks would be massless, with 
the consequence that there are no protons, no 
neutrons, no atoms, no molecules, no bulk 
matter and of course no humans, no planets, 
etc. In other words, without the Higgs Boson, 
the world would be entirely different.”  

English theoretical physicist and professor 
emeritus Peter Higgs at the University of 
Edinburgh theorized in the 1960s that a 
field exists throughout the universe the same 
way that we experience magnetic fields and 
gravitational fields. 

However, the Higgs Field cannot be turned 
off the way an electromagnetic field can. 
Scientists adapted this theory and now refer to 
it as the Higgs Field. 

Sharma said if the particle does not exist it 
will shake the foundations of science because we 
will have to start from scratch in trying to find 
the answer of where mass comes from. 

“It will be chaos,” Sharma said. “But science 
thrives in chaos.”

strong@ucsd.edu.

yourselves the council that thought 
it reasonable to raise student fees 
during a fiscal crisis for a benefit 
that you’ll see when no one gives 
a fuck about where you went for 
undergrad,” Swerhone said.

According to Swerhone, 
the referendum would cost an 
estimated $500 per student per 
year. 

O’Rear stepped down Nov. 27 
due to personal reasons. Castro 
could not be reached for comment 
as of press time. A.S. President 
Alyssa Wing said that, while she 
could not speak about the specific 

positions, resolutions are common 
in student government. 

Romero, O’Rear’s replacement 
as Speaker, said that there “is not 
more added responsibility.” 

According to Romero, the 
Speaker of the House is responsible 
for running a speakers list and 
enforcing Robert’s Rules of Order, 
which govern how the council 
interacts. Romero said that the 
biggest transition would require 
becoming more familiar with 
Robert’s Rules. 

Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Kevin Hoang and Vice 
President of External Affairs Samer 
Naji are filling the vacant positions 

of AVP of Student Orgs and AVP 
of Local Affairs until replacements 
can be found. 

A.S. Council started accepting 
applications for the vacant positions 
Jan. 10. The filing period for all 
open positions closed Monday, 
Jan. 16. A.S. Council started 
interviewing qualified candidates 
this week for the two positions.

Speaker of the House and AVP of 
Local Affairs Ryan O’ Rear declined 
to comment. Sixth College Council 
President Kristian Castro could not 
be reached as of press time.

Wednesday night’s A.S. Council Meeting was one long update on ongoing 
A.S. projects.

This included President Alyssa 
Wing’s update on the move to 
Division-I sports. According to Wing, 
the UC Office of 
the President has 
not responded 
to the technical 
revisions that 
were submitted 
over a week ago.

“Once we get 
that [approval], 
hopefully by next week, we can 
definitely move forward,” she said.

Wing also announced that 
Wednesday, Feb. 1 will be A.S. 
Council’s “super-public” meeting, 
where constituents can come to the 
meeting early for a council meet-and-
greet and enjoy free snacks. (Because 
starving college students will only sit 
through an A.S. Council meeting for 
free food.)

Speaking of food, Vice President 
of Finance and Resources Kevin 
Hoang handed out assignments for 
Council Lunches. Councilmembers 
are very serious about their bonding 
time.

Vice President of External Affairs 
Samer Naji reminded council that the 
Board of Regents meeting is in a few 
days, and buses will be leaving tonight 
and tomorrow morning for students 
who find protesting to be more 
important than their time in class. He 
was also happy to announce that the 
A.S. Council website was blacked out 
for the day in protest to SOPA and 
PIPA. I’m sure many students noticed 
and were dismayed.

With so much business, 
Hoang was anxious to know who 
Councilmember of the Week was, 

and demanded that Vice President 
of Student Life Meredith Madnick 
make the announcement.

“I’m so surprised you asked that 
question,” she said, and then went on 
to announce this week’s winner of the 
glittery sash, Associate Vice President 

of Diversity Affairs 
Jesus Romero. 
Among his 
accomplishments 
was his stepping 
up to the position 
of Council Speaker 
after Ryan O’Rear 
resigned last 

quarter.
The meeting closed with Wing’s 

unveiling of the first draft of the new 
CLICS facility. The layout includes 
a large lecture hall in the middle, 
an entryway with standing work 
bars similar to those in Price Center 
East and three study areas to hold 
approximately 130 seats.

Council debated whether students 
would value having the rooms set up 
in a three-tiered noise level system, 
so that one room allows open talking, 
one room is quiet talking and one 
room is eerily silent. It might also 
be possible to make the three study 
spaces into one larger study space to 
allow approximately 150 seats and a 
consistent, open noise level similar to 
what students could expect at the old 
CLICS.

“There will be a tribute to [the 
old] CLICS,” Wing said. “[What 
CLICS was] won’t be lost in this 
building. CLICS will live on!”

While there were mixed feelings 
about whether the extra seats or the 
noise control would be the best value 
for students, A.S. Council all snapped 
in agreement to the suggestion of 
the addition of hydration stations 
throughout the building.

According to a March 3, 2011 
Guardian article titled “Students 
Discuss Changes to Campus 
Smoking Policy,” the American 
College Health Association 
surveyed over 500 UCSD students 
in Spring Quarter 2010; the survey 
concluded that about 67 percent of 
students were in favor of a revised 

smoking policy.
In February 2011, A.S. Council 

passed suggesting that smoking be 
limited to outdoor parking lots.

Sad and alone on a Friday night? Don’t worry, Omegle’s got your back.  How-to Guru is here to 
teach you how to chat up the Internet-
bound ladies and gents in style. 

Omegle.com is an online chat 
website on which people are randomly 
entered into anonymous one-on-one 
chat sessions under the usernames 
of “You” and “Stranger.” To your 
relief, you don’t even have to pretend 
to be Sir Shits-a-Lot who lives on 
123 Fake Street because none of 
that registration mumbo jumbo is 
required. 

And no, don’t even think about 
conducting a nice conversation about 
your political views and favorite indie 
bands, bo-ring. Adopt any persona 
you’d like. It’s the Internet, for God’s 
sake, who’s judging? If you really had a 
life you’d be out talking to real people. 

Nine times out of 10, the stranger 
on the other end of the line will 
prompt you with the classy pick-up 
line, “ASL? ;)” — now this is where the 
fun begins.  Let your inner deviant 
run wild. Be creepy.  Who you will 
have the most fun being, however, 
is highly dependent on your victim. 
Here are some character ideas:

Slutty six-year-old. Use this if 
you’re talking to a dude — the older, 
the better. Shoot back with “6/f/lookin’ 
4 a gud time” and when Stranger 
asks if you meant “16” not “6,” kindly 
correct him and go into a long 
dissertation about how you idolize 
Dora the Explorer and wish she would 
wear a padded kiddie bra like you 
do. This one requires attention to 
detail. Replace words with numbers 
where appropriate, intentionally drop 
vowels, and spell words juss lyke hw 
dey sound – only don’t get too carried 
away, Captain Obvious.

Creepy old guy. You know, the 
kind who lurks the candy aisle of 
Ralphs on Valentine’s Day hoping to 
win over doe-eyed girls with their 
over-rehearsed, saccharine lines. 
This works best with young girls, 
preferably in their teens. However old 
they are, simply add 30 years to their 
age and you’re golden. Remember 
– the more lust-induced speech, the 
better. Wooderson from “Dazed and 
Confused” croons, “Mmm, I love high 
school girls. I get older, they stay the 
same age…stayin’ fresh for the pickin’.”  

Socially awkward freak. Interject 
random, useless facts about yourself 
while the other person is trying to 
talk. Steer the conversation away 
from socially accepted conventions. 
(Think Kristen Wiig’s lip-smacking, 
one-upping character on “SNL.”) This 
section doesn’t need much elaboration 
because if you’re actually doing this, 
chances are you’re probably already 
socially awkward. 

Don’t be offended if you are met 
with the message “Your conversational 
partner has disconnected” — some 
lame-os can’t take a joke. Forget that 
rager that you were expressly told not 
to show up to, and spend hours of fun 
huddled around your laptop suited 
up in your Forever Lazy. You will 
be laughing all night at the types of 
responses you will get, and at yourself 
for your progressively degenerative

You Will 
Never Fear 
Being Alone 
Again

The University of California released preliminary data on undergraduate applications Jan. 12, revealing two 
significant, but not altogether unsurprising, 
figures: Applications from out-of-state and 
international students are up, while applications 
from transfers are down.

Let’s break it down with the stats: The 
number of non-Californians that applied to 
become UC students in Fall 2012 rose 56 
percent over last year to about 33,000. In-state 
applications are also up, rising 9.8 percent 
over last year to about 93,300, while transfer 
applications are down 6 percent. 

Put the data together, and it’s shitty all 
around for California residents seeking a public 
education.

According to Kate Jeffrey, UC’s interim 
director of undergraduate admissions, the 
increase in non-resident applications can be 
attributed to students nationwide “hedging 
their bets and not just applying to private 
institutions.”

Apparently, students are applying to a public 
university careening toward privatization 
instead. Oh, the irony.

For non-residents, the fact that the 
University of California is a public system is 
irrelevant, as the higher tuition they pay means 
the cost is the same as any private university. 
So the more out-of-state and international 
students are accepted to a UC, the more the 
system is essentially privatized — and the more 
money the UC gets. Considering the dismal 
state budget is hardly reliable (750 million has 
been cut from UC state funding this year), that 
money is more crucial than ever.

But most non-residents will be disappointed 
come spring. UC officials have promised to 
cap non-resident students at 10 percent — 
still a noteworthy increase from the current 
6.9 percent. And since UCLA, UC Berkeley 
and UCSD receive the most applications 
(respectively), they also might see the most 
non-residents on their campuses. Put it this 
way: UC Merced won’t have out-of-state or 
international students dying to attend — 
thereby allowing the campus to focus more on 
the in-state students who were promised an 
affordable education by the California Master 
Plan for Higher Education. Instead, the top-tier 
UC schools will bear the brunt of the surge in 

out of state-ers.
Meanwhile, according to Jeffrey, the 

decrease in transfer students is due to a 
“pipeline issue,” referring to the bottleneck 
occurring at California community colleges 
when classes are cut and students are unable to 
get the credits they need to transfer. Just look 
at the numbers: Students from community 
colleges make up the largest portion of transfer 
students — and they dropped by 5.7 percent.

As a result, the governing board of the 
California Community Colleges approved a set 
of reforms Jan. 9 that aims to streamline the 
road to graduation, certification and transfers, 
including prioritizing registration for students 
who have declared these educational goals.

Hopefully such changes will bring the 
number of transfer students up again. As for 
California students looking to attend a UC 
school, we can only hope that Jerry Brown 
finds room in the state budget to make them a 
priority, because without help from the state, 
the UC system will have to ditch its promises 
out of dire necessity — and judging by the 
numbers, there’s plenty of students worth more 
money outside the Golden State.

UC Increase of  Non-Residents Signals Move Toward Privatization

When UC President Mark G. Yudof announced that all 10 campuses would ban 
smoking by 2014, it sounded like a 
drastic change. �e decision has made 
headlines nationwide, was applauded by 
environmental blogs and even merited an 
editorial in the Los Angeles Times. But for 
the students who’ve been following campus 
policy changes for the past two years, 
Yudof’s big moment means exactly one big 
thing for UCSD smokers: Parking lots are 
no longer fair game. 
     As of the Jan. 9 mandate released in a 
letter to the 10 UC chancellors, the system 
is more committed to “healthcare and 
environmental concerns” than ever. Yudof 
is wisely leaving the nitty-gritty details of 
the new policy up to each school. While 
smoking is now banned in all areas, from 
the obvious (residence halls) to the former 
havens of the nicotine-addicted (said 
parking lots), the speci�c details of the ban 

radius and punishment will be decided 
on an individual level. Since all campuses 
already ban smoking within 20 to 30 feet of 
buildings, this mostly means that lighting 
up in outdoor areas is no longer permitted. 
For UC San Francisco, which already bans 
smoking, and the Hillcrest UCSD Health 
Sciences campus, which banned smoking 
on a trial run last year — this means 
nothing.  
     For the rest of us, living and studying 
at a school which alternately is one of 
the biggest campuses and also has one of 
the most stringent existing no-smoking 
policies, this means that 50 or so designated 
“smoking areas” and the people who 
used them are out of luck. Everyone 
else will likely keep calm and continue 
surreptitiously smoking in Warren Field. 
We simply lack the resources to properly 
patrol this soon-to-be infraction and, with 

A Hazy Future 
A systemwide ban on smoking at UC campuses is a well-intentioned move, but will prove largely 

ineffective and costly.

Dear Editor, 
Regarding “Pendleton General 

Leads Probe”: The behavior of 
four Marines depicted by a widely 
distributed video in which they 
are seen urinating on the corpses 
of enemy combatants ought to be 
evaluated in both psychological 
and moral terms. Public opinion 
and the Marine Corps reaction 
will be quite telling. Locally, 
former Marine Bruce Kesler of 
Encinitas is on record as stating, 
“It sure beats chopping off heads 
and mutilating bodies, like they 
do.” This is in response to the 
Talibans’ purported behavior 
toward Americans. According to the 
preeminent child psychologist and 
moralist Laurence Kholberg, the 
reaction of Mr. Kesler is at perhaps 
a third-grade level. Furthermore, 
liquid seeks its own level and from 
the Bible, we are admonished that 
“an eye for an eye makes us all 
blind.” Mr. Kesler, I would hope 
that, since the time of Attila the 
Hun, we are a nation that has 
evolved beyond the weakness of 
psychological retribution. Why 
stand behind the curtain of national 
morality or lack thereof? I would 
expect more!

Dear Editor, 
In 2009, the Bridgepoint’s CEO 

took $20 million in stock options.
In a Securities and Exchange 

Commission filing, Education 
Management, known as EDMC, 
disclosed that the attorneys general 

of several states were planning to 
join in a False Claims Act case 
against them. EDMC — 40 percent 
of which is owned by Goldman 
Sachs — enrolls nearly 150,000 
students, operating several career-
college chains, including the Art 
Institute and Argosy University.

 I don’t know if California 
Attorney General Kamala Harris is 
co-plaintiff yet, so I wrote yesterday 
to Sacramento to ask her. UC Regent 
Richard C. Blum made investments 
in two for-profit higher education 
companies, Career Education Corp. 
and ITT Educational Services Inc.  
Blum’s San Francisco investment 
firm is the largest shareholder in 
both firms; the firm’s combined 
holdings in these two stocks are 
valued at about $700 million. 

Blum was appointed to the 
UC Board of Regents by former 
California Governor Gray Davis 
(formerly Brown’s chief-of-staff in 
Brown’s earlier term as Governor). 
Blum’s term on the UC Regents 
expires in 2014. Blum himself, when 
we met briefly on the sidelines of 
the UC Regents meeting held in 
San Diego, claimed that he had no 
control over his own portfolio. And 
besides, he acquired $700 million 
for-profit college shares  “before I 
married Dianne.” Blum is the 
husband of U.S. Senator Dianne 
Feinstein.

Actions of Select 
Marines are Immoral

burgeoning class sizes, cancellations and underpaid 
professors, redirecting any money away from academics 
to target students is absurd.  
     Unless the committee creating UCSD’s policy comes 
up with truly draconian punishments for breaking the 
ban and �nds the money to fund those in charge of 
becoming smoking vigilantes, the new policy is unlikely 
to be e�ective on a campus that spans 59 acres — and 
maybe that’s not necessarily a bad thing.  
      Yudof’s plan smacks of paternalism. While he cites 
the nearly 600 other universities that have adopted this 
ban and the need to remain leaders in environmental 
practices, his sta�, including Chief Risk O�cer Grace 
Crickette, plainly said that it was about “helping people 
live healthier.” 

Obviously, the dangers of cigarettes are well-
documented. Unlike most drugs, cigarettes harm others 
via secondhand smoke, which makes smoking policies a 

societal concern that a�ects non-smokers. 
But also, unlike most, drugs cigarettes are legal, and 
Yudof’s new plan has the university playing mommy 
and daddy to a captive audience. �ere’s a di�erence 
between an o�ce smoking ban and a ban at a place 
where nearly 9,000 people live. 

Banning smoking in enclosed spaces is necessary, 
but banning smoking at RIMAC Field, where a single 
smoker is unlikely to create enough secondhand smoke 
to harm anyone is inconvenient — which may be part of 
Yudof’s goal to use the policy as a deterrent. 

In the meanwhile, many who live on campus are 
older adults, not 18-year-old freshmen, and it’s absurd 
to expect them to leave their homes to escape the radius.  

It’s touching that the UC system is concerned about 
our health, but the university should, if at all possible, 
retain designated smoking areas in the interest of 
“inclusion” and to serve the needs of all members of the 
campus community.

IT’S NOT OVER
While 
Kermit’s 
Banjo Gently
Weeps
I t doesn’t take a cinephile to know that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has typically been 
more concerned with purebred sophis-
tication than commemorating great 

films. So, with only a few months before 
the Awards, the Academy’s first major 
roadblock proved un-Oscars — very 
un-Oscars indeed. 

Scheduled host Eddie Murphy 
(nothing screams “suave” like the Nutty 
Professor) called it quits in solidar-
ity with friend and Academy Awards 
producer Brett Ratner, who resigned 
after using an anti-gay slur in a televised 
Q&A (double suave). The consequent 
vacancy led Jim Henson fans from all 
walks of life to wait and hope that, in 
this fledgling decade of glorious change, 
we’d see the once-politically unimagi-
nable come to fruition: the first Muppet 
host of the Academy Awards. 

But the dream was short-lived; Billy 
Crystal got the part (admittedly backed 
by a dynamite ad campaign) and none 
of this would be of much consequence 
if it all didn’t seem to vindicate the infi-
nite snub festival that these immensely 
important puppets will have to endure 
this February. 

Only recently have the Oscars 
begun acknowledging “family mov-
ies” as serious contenders, and though 
their choices have been surprisingly 
commendable (movies made by Pixar), 
they’ve all been relatively similar and, 
above all else, ultra-modern. In fact, 
not a single movie in Pixar’s arsenal has 
been without some hefty contemporary 
proverb in tow. “WALL-E” weaved the 
consequences of consumer greed and 
excess into beautifully imagined scenes 
of deep space, “Finding Nemo” was a 
bountiful cornucopia of childhood loss, 
wayward fatherhood and the impor-
tance of letting go and “Monsters, Inc.” 
pulled the cute, fuzzy rug out from 
under naive children to reveal the disil-
lusionment of a voiceless working class 
in a coldhearted and impersonal capi-
talist industry.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m Pixar-
obsessive, and it’s this kind of multi-
layered storytelling that allows Pixar 
to reach such a diverse audience. But 
what made “The Muppets” so fresh and 
unforgettable was that it was so remark-
ably un-modern. Unlike its more recent 
predecessors in the franchise, “The 
Muppets” didn’t concern itself with 
adapting. (In fact, it lampooned the 
very notion, introducing the comically 
terrifying Moopets — “A hard, cyni-
cal act for a hard, cynical world,” Chris 
Cooper’s maniacal villain Tex Richman 
explained.) Of course, the entire gang 
was present, along with all the dorky 
vaudevillian schtick, self-referential 
humor, plenty of fourth-wall destruc-
tion and a pitch-perfect batch of songs 
from perhaps the most worthy of mod-
ern Muppet collaborators, Flight of the 
Conchords’ Brett McKenzie. Most strik-
ing, however, was how “The Muppets” 
still felt like an untouched style of enter-
tainment all its own. 

There’s a great sequence in Charlie 
Kaufman’s “Being John Malkovich” 

T
he Ché Café has been saved — at least, 
for the time being. UCSD’s iconic DIY 
landmark for underground music, vegan 
food and political activism — not to men-

tion one of the only precious underage indie venues 
in San Diego — faced looming financial troubles 
recently, as staff struggled to raise $12,000 in insur-
ance fees to avoid foreclosure. A slew of modest 
fundraiser shows culminated in the I Promise 
Benefit Festival, which took place over the course 
of three days, Jan. 6 to Jan. 8, and featured phe-
nomenal headlining sets from art-punk juggernauts 
No Age and HEALTH, as well as performances by 
Crystal Antlers, Weatherbox, XBXRX, Griever and 
more. The benefit was ultimately a success, selling 
out each day and raising around $13,000 in dona-
tions. 

 But the fight isn’t over. Though the fun-
draiser helped relieve the Ché’s financial burden, 
its primary benefit was the increased publicity. “It’s 
important that people remember that [the café is] 
an active and welcoming place to go, perform their 
own music, set up their own shows and see bands 
they’ve been wanting to see for years,” I Promise 

booking agent Scott Sanders told the UCSD 
Guardian last week. Since the Ché first opened in 
1980, it has been a staunch defender of independent 
music, hosting an impressive list of now-influential 
bands ranging from Green Day and Drive Like 
Jehu, to Sleep, Animal Collective, and as recent as 
2008, Bon Iver. But that was then. Now, the Ché’s 
biggest problem seems to be a simple lack of on-
campus enthusiasm for underground music.

That’s not to say, however, that the Ché is with-
out its loyal fans. “We are going to publish a book: 
a really cool book, full of poems, songs, illustra-
tions and photographs all done by people who have 
been a wonderful part of the music scene,” reads 
Dan Faughnder’s Facebook page for “Friends and 
Acquaintances Alike: A Celebration of DIY Culture 
and the Ché Café.” The collaborative book will 
include voluntary contributions from anyone wish-
ing to help out the Ché, acting both as a chronicle 
of the landmark’s history and a purchasable fund-
raiser — a final push for this indispensable venue. 

The deadline for submissions is this Saturday, Jan. 
21. For more information, visit Ché Café Collective 
on Facebook or email SaveTheCheBook@gmail.com.

where Malkovich becomes interna-
tionally renowned in the absurd craft 
of puppeteering, moving audiences 
to tears and even inspiring other 
high-profile actors to follow in his 
footsteps. It’s an amusing satire of 
the art world’s arbitrary standards, 
but isn’t this essentially what hap-
pened to Jim Henson? After the 
fact, the Muppet formula may seem 
like a natural winner, but no one 
could’ve predicted that this avant-
garde filmmaker-turned-children’s 
puppeteer would forever change the 
landscape of G-rated entertainment 
(Let’s not forget “Sesame Street,” 
“Fraggle Rock,” “Labyrinth” and, of 
course, the tragically-overlooked Jedi 
Master Yoda). 

Henson was successful because 
he so willingly embodied the 
ultimate cult artist. Not only did 
he invent new worlds, he liter-
ally invented new, complicated 
characters to inhabit these worlds. 
Equal parts product of the love-and-
psychedelia hippie era and response 

to the increasingly-homogenized 
Disney, Henson miraculously 
weaned a generation of kids off 
cartoon characters who spent most 
of their time beating the shit out of 
each other, in order to simply chat 
with neighbors on the most racially 
diverse (and longest running) street 
in morning television history, or 
mingle with the strangely intel-
lectual Muppets on the “Muppet 
Show.” He even managed to include 
adult artists, musicians and actors in 
these worlds (Video artist William 
Wegman’s anthropomorphic wei-
maraners on “Sesame Street” shall 
forever hold a special place in my 
heart), effectively creating a fertile 
multicultural bazaar custom-fit for 
the curious mind of a child. Henson’s 
importance cannot be overstated. 

So while America may not be 
ready for a Muppet in the Oscar 
limelight, let’s hope our humble felt 
friends are not completely forgotten 
when the red carpet is unfurled. This 
year, “The Muppets” assured audi-
ences that there’s no rush to grow up. 
Some of us could use the reminder.

ALBUM REVIEW

S traddling the border between sleek minimal techno and skewed avant-garde pop, 
Matthew Dear occupies a relatively 
unique musical niche. This fact, 
coupled with his general creative 
restlessness, makes listening to new 
work from Matthew Dear an excit-
ing experience. From the off-kilter 
micro-pop experiment of 2007’s 

Asa Breed to the dark, night-drive 
techno of 2010’s excellent Black 
City, Dear seems determined to 
change both his style and his aes-
thetic on each successive release.

On “Headcage,” the lead single 
from Dear’s upcoming Beams LP 
and title track of this EP, we see 
Dear dropping the dusky atmo-
sphere and muted vibes of Black 
City, preferring instead to bask in 
glowing, technicolor mock-gamelan 
synth lines and a rhythmic looped 
vocal refrain. The sleaziness that 
characterized Black City, however, 
is still present, with Dear luridly 
informing the listener that his or 
her “momma won’t care if we sleep 
out tonight” before inviting the 
listener to “come have fun tonight.” 
The resulting track is one of the 

most infectious, triumphant and 
cool songs to be released so far this 
year.

Elsewhere on the EP, Dear’s 
approach proves less successful. On 
“In the Middle (I Met You There),” 
a collaboration with The Drum’s 
Jonathon Pierce, Dear crafts a fas-
cinating, hip-hop-inspired instru-
mental, but Pierce’s vocals just don’t 
have the same punch as Dear’s 
would have. The EP’s other tracks, 
the plaintive, pastoral “Street Song” 
and “Around the Fountain,” are 
decent — if relatively uninterest-
ing — soundscapes that pale in 
comparison to the EP’s fantastic 
title track.

ALBUM REVIEW

F ollowing a triumphant open-ing salvo of synth lines and thumping kick drum, The 
Big Pink’s new album Future This 
shoots you through space on a blast 
of futuristic electro-rock, but only 
after a troubled take-off forces it a 
bit off course.

Early songs like “Hit the Ground 

(Superman)” are weighed down 
by studio-polished mainstream 
aspirations, while “Give It Up” 
has the kind of sing-along chorus 
that would gel instantly in the 
sonic spectrum of an indie-electro 
minded festival like Coachella. 
Fortunately, this monotonous pop 
soon gives way to more sonically-
ambitious work.

By mid-album, the engines of 
The Big Pink spaceship hit full 
force, and the album escapes into 
more unexplored territory in tracks 
like “Rubbernecking” and “Jump 
Music.”  Bumping bass and spacey, 
reverb-laden guitars permeate 
throughout, and each individual 
sound becomes harder to distin-
guish.

By the time we’ve reached the 
title track, singer Robbie Furze is 
singing of astral planes and the 
unpredictable future, only to follow 
it up with the relatively restrained 
closing number “77.” The listener is 
given time to reflect here, as Furze 
longingly sings, “I wish I had 77 
ways to say no.” 

Future This is an unpredictable 
journey. Despite a bumpy take-off, 
the skillfully-crafted, psychedelical-
ly-cluttered soundscapes of tracks 
like “Jump Music” ensure that the 
album ends in more fascinating 
places.

8 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, JANUARY 19,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

MOVIE REVIEW

A dvertised as a high-�ying, action-packed, dubstep-heavy, dog-�ghting blockbuster, “Red Tails” aims for a 
combination of 
“Star Wars” and 
“Glory” with a 
dash of “Top Gun” 
thrown in to make 
it commercially 
viable. But even 
with George Lucas 
serving as its enthusiastic executive producer, 
“Red Tails” seemed unsure from the get-
go whether it was a semi-serious historical 
drama or a balls-to-the-wall action pulp — 
and consequently, the �lm spends most of its 
time �ailing awkwardly between the two. 

In the midst of World War II, black 
fighter pilots were a part of the little-respect-
ed Tuskegee Airmen. These brave pilots 
were forced to fly hand-me-down planes 
on insultingly mundane missions that at 
most involved destroying easy targets. With 
enough perseverance, they eventually suc-
ceeded in getting their first big break as the 
escorts on a beach assault. The catch: If they 
failed, their company would be shut down. 
Cue inspirational music, then cut to some 
chanting and later a bit of heroism and our 
underdogs come back as legends. But even 
when they return as successful soldiers, their 
superior officers only see their program as an 
“experiment,” and not an entirely successful 
one at that. 

There is a lot of story to be mined here: 
Heroes who give their lives for a country 
that doesn’t respect them, the personal and 
emotional issues that keep them from fulfill-

ing their full potential, the pursuit of the 
American Dream that may or may not be 
entirely fictional. The themes of brother-
hood, unity and perseverance all come up 
throughout the film, yet first-time director 
Anthony Hemingway doesn’t seem to know 
what to do with the material provided to 
him. Sometimes we cut away from a scene 
before the emotions can truly resonate with 
us. Other times we spend far too much time 
with characters we barely recognize. 

Most of the characters we are familiar 
with can be boiled down to a single identity, 
and then that identity can be further reduced 
to a few one-liners after shooting down their 
Nazi opponents (“Take that, Mr. Hitler!”). 
Only the young engineer-to-be Lieutenant 
Gannon (Tristan Wilds, “The Wire”) gives 
enthusiastic hope for the soldiers’ future, and 
though his devotion at times appears naïve, 
it also makes him more authentic than his 
comrades Joker (who is a joker in case this 
was unclear) and Ne-Yo’s cameo performance 
as someone named Smokey (though it’s hard 

to remember what exactly his character does 
in the film, or when he even appears). 

Academy Award winners Cuba Gooding 
Jr. and Terrence Howard both appear as the 
commanding officers of the pilots, yet neither 
gives his role the proper amount of authority 
to make it believable. This would be toler-
able if they instead turned in hammed-up, 
scenery-chewing performances à la the great 
Nicolas Cage that would distract from the 
painfully formulaic, bare-bones script. But as 
it is, these two are perhaps the most forget-
table part of a forgettable movie.

And all of this could be forgiven if “Red 
Tails” had instead committed itself to being 
a roaring beast of an action blockbuster. And 
while Lucas did put an impressive 58 million 
dollars into the film — a mark that certainly 
shows in the flight sequences — it still man-
ages to forgo any semblance of drama or 
thrills. Think of a Michael Bay movie minus 
the frantic editing, but still dull. A plane flies 
to the left. Another plane follows. Then that 
plane gets shot. Rinse and repeat, and soon 

the movie is over. 
But for all its yawns, it’s hard to com-

pletely hate “Red Tails.” Its subjects are truly 
deserving of our admiration, as they did 
indeed sacrifice their lives to defend a coun-
try that had little trouble forgetting about 
them. But as an action picture, the film miss-
es out on the actual thrills. And, complete 
with a hackneyed nationalist point of view 
that overlooks the real issues of its characters, 
“Red Tails” is a disappointment not only as a 
blockbuster but also as an important piece of 
American history.

The UCSD Men’s Volleyball team split their weekend matches last weekend in the Grand Canyon University tournament. In their 
two non-conference matches, the Tritons topped 
the New Jersey Institute of Technology in five sets 
on Saturday, Jan. 14 before being swept by Grand 
Canyon the following day.

    Sophomore setter 
Mike Brunsting coordinated 
the Triton attack on 
Saturday, recording a 
career-high of 55 assists 
and 12 digs against the 
Highlanders. Outside hitter 
Carl Eberts also finished 
with a double-double, 15 
kills and 11 digs.

The 0-1 Highlanders and 
the Tritons each recorded 
14 kills in the first set, as 
the squads traded points, 
New Jersey Tech took the 
set 21-25.

 In the second set, 
UCSD rebounded, taking 
the first five points off four kills from sophomore 
outside hitter Vaun Lennon. 

“[Lennon] did a lot of work for us today,” said 
head coach Kevin Ring. “He really carried a big load 
for us, finishing with 49 swings.

Lennon finished with 22 kills, nine digs and four 
blocks, combining for a career-high total of 24.5 
points, leading the Tritons to a 25-21 win in the 
second set. Riding the momentum, UCSD took the 
third set 26-24, but fell in the fourth 20-25.

“In the game against [New Jersey Institute of 
Technology] we definitely came out slow,” said Ring. 
“But we got the big points when we needed them.”

In overtime, the Tritons rallied, recording two 
consecutive points to take the set, 15-13. 

“Both teams had a hard time sustaining runs 
today,” said Ring. “We just made some key plays 
down the stretch that really made the difference for 
us.”

With the win, UCSD improves to 2-2, while New 
Jersey Tech falls to 0-2. 

The Tritons did not fair as well in their second 
ever match against host, Grand Canyon University. 
The Antelopes beat the Tritons in straight sets, to 
record their first win in program history against a 
team from the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. 

Despite 11 kills apiece from Eberts and Lennon, 
UCSD never really came 
close to Grand Canyon. 
The Tritons fell 21-25 in 
the first and second sets 
and 19-25 in the third 
set.

“The biggest issue 
for us today was the 
service aces,” said Ring to 
members of the athletics 
department. “When one 
guy misses a serve, it 
puts a lot of pressure on 
the next guy and added 
pressure on the rest of 
our game.”

The Tritons 
committed 18 service 

errors compared to the Antelopes’ 13 errors.
UCSD didn’t play particularly poorly, but was 

just edged out by Grand Canyon in all categories. 
The Antelopes had an attack percentage of .304 on 
40 kills, 12 errors and 92 attempts, just better than 
UCSD’s .202 attack percentage on 36 kills, 17 errors 
and 94 attempts.

The Tritons now fall to 2-3 overall as they enter 
their conference matchup against No. 2 UC Irvine on 
Saturday, Jan. 21.

“We’re going in facing one of the top teams in 
the country, and it’s going to be a tough match,” said 
Ring. “In the MPSF so many teams are so good that 
it’s always difficult, but I think we’re getting back to 
playing some good volleyball. We’re just going to go 
in and play to the best of our abilities and if we’re 
doing that then we have the advantage.”

GAMES

Associate Sports Editor

  

Going into last week’s games, the UCSD Women’s Basketball team was ranked No. 2 in the nation and had its sights set on the 
best start to the season ever. 

 UCSD surpassed the mark set in 2010 when the 
team went 25-5, breaking their 15-game winning 
streak to Humboldt State, who ultimately knocked 
the Tritons out of postseason play. 
    After rolling over the only other undefeated 
team in the CCAA, No. 22 Cal State Monterey 
Bay, the Tritons are looking at both a conference 
championship berth and a place in the national 
tournament. 

On Tuesday, the NCAA coach’s poll — made up 
of 33 Division II coaches from around the nation 
— voted in favor of UCSD. The Tritons received 26 
out of 31 first place votes, jettisoning UCSD into 
first place over Clayton State University (16-1), last 
year’s NCAA Division II champions.

“It’s a great accomplishment for our team to 
have climbed to the top ranking,” said junior guard 
Emily Osga. “However, it is rather meaningless at 
this point in our season. We need to be able to back 
it up and show its full implications by completing 
the second half of CCAA play as strongly as the 
first half.”

In the two preceding years, UCSD has collected 
over 40 wins, but had not been able to break 
through to the national tournament. This season, 
after returning all of its starters, the Tritons look 
poised for success.

The squad is replete with head coach Charity 
Elliott returning for her fifth season at the helm, as 
well as 2011 Triton Athlete of the Year, senior guard 
Chelsea Carlisle.      

Elliott — whose husband Chris Elliott is also 
part of the coaching staff — has the best coaching 
record of any basketball coach in UCSD’s history. 
She has amassed a 113-31 overall record for a 78 
percent success rate. 

In the midst of her final season at UCSD, 
Carlisle has some serious career stats herself. 

The 2010 All-American has a career shooting 
percentage of 41 percent from the field and 80 
percent from the free-throw line, recording 1,409 
points. 

No other guard in UCSD history has reached 
this watermark. But in 2012, the highlight from 
Carlisle hasn’t been her threat from the field, but 
her ability to make the players around her better. 

 Senior shooting guard Daisy Feder averages 
nearly 11 points per game, senior forward Lauren 
Freidenberg has nabbed three double-doubles and 
is averaging 14.1 points per game along with 8.1 
boards. 

Junior standout Emily Osga is averaging 12 
points and five rebounds, and has led the team in 
scoring several times this year, with a high of 23 
points against Chico State on Jan. 7.  
    Sophomore Erin Dautremont has stepped up to 
help the Tritons this year. 

After playing in 30 games as a freshman, 
Dautremont earned the starting position and could 
become a leader for UCSD looking down the road. 
    “Right now, our mentality is to improve in 
practice every day and take it one game at a time,” 
said Osga. 
    This season’s women’s basketball team looks 
better than any other team in the nation. Now 
everyone knows it, and everyone will be shooting to 
take down the big dogs.
