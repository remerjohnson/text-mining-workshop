Opinions clash when 
the roles of minorities 
in the university are 
discussed. Do they get 
a fair shot at admission 
and graduation? Why 
aren't they admitted in 
proportion to their 
population and what's 
being done to 
straighten things out?

Halley's Comet 
By NIKI NE\Vl.ANDS. Sla.1f IV/lin 

I NA DIS lJ ~SI Oi'! on comets last Thursl.IJ \,. Nove mber 21. Dr Harr)' Houpls. a UC D research phYSICISt. announced that contral), to popul,\r beltef. most comets do not have tails 
The hour long presentation. held 111 the North Conlcrence Room. 

covered the hlsto!)' 01 comets and their phYS ical and chemical 
aspe ts HouriS focused on the comet now VISIble to the Earth. 
Halley's Cornel. 

Houpis. a Fullbngh t scholar. completed hiS undergraduate studi es 
at MIT. He came 10 lIC D to do Ius ion research hut was redirected to 
astro-phys lcs for lack of necessa!)' funds. Currentl) he IS researchi ng 
"dusty plaslllJ(h ," as we ll as comets. 

Halley's Comet is named after the man who pred icted th e comet 's 
re turn occurred mallY year after his death . Halley's makes an 
appearan e approximately every 77 years, maki ng it baSically a once-
lI1 -a-hfenme event. Halley should also be credited for having made 

ewtoman phy ics popular. Houpls potnted OUt , as Halley used the 
formulas 10 predict the comet's return . 

Accordi ng to Houpis, th ere are references to Halley's comet as 
ancie nt as 230 B.C. ( by th.e Chinese) and 164 B.C. (In Babylon). 
GIOllO, a famo us artiSt , pall1 ted a picture entitled 'The Adoration of 
the Three Magi" which depicts Christ's birth with Halley's Comet in 
the skies above. In July of this year. the EPA. an aeronautical society 
involvoing seve ral European countries, launched a space craft named 
aft er Giono. which will monitor the comer. 

Houp is we nt on 10 say that in 1066. William the Conquerer saw 
Halley'S Comet. This has led many historians LO postulate that it had 
a pS)lchologlcal effect on the outcome of the war The English may 
have seen th e comet and thought th at it forecasted doom. Houpls 
said . 

Dunng HaUey's next appearance. in 1910, people again believed It 
was an evil sign. This time , Houpis said . they thought it was gomg to 
collide with the Ea rth. There were many suicides. and entrepreneurs 
rook advantage of thiS fear and manufactured "Comet Pill s," "Comet 
oap ," and other "quack" products to ward off the comet's effects 

Houpls explained some of the chemical aspects of comets. A 
"shell" of comets lies outSid e the solar s)'stem, he said. pace debriS 
coalesces to fo rm comets and Jupiter's gravitational field caused th e 
debrIS 10 fly out to the shell. Approxlmatley seven comets per year are 
sent down hy the stars. ometimes Jup iter and Saturn will keep them 
111 their orbits. Houpis sa id . 

A comet, wh ich looks much like a huge. dirty snowball, Houpis 
explained . forms twO ki nds of tatis: a plasma tail from ionized gas 
and a dust tail from dust pan icles About 50 percent of all comets do 
not have any tails , Houpis said ; some have only one and a few have 
several. A ta il can span the distance from the sun to Mars. 

There are five space shuttles monitoring Halley's comet - the EPA 
shuttle. two Russian 3.'1d two japanese. Houpis said . He is 
disappointed wi th the lack of patticipation' by the United States. "A 
big nation should be able to find ways of doing things: he said . If 
every person in the u.s. gave up buyi ng one six pack of so ft drinks 
thiS year, the saved money would have funded a launch, Houpis said. 

The Un ited S~tes has organized an international comet watch that 
consists of 1,000 astronomers in 40 counrries. All their measurements 
are being standardized . The United States also has several shuttles 
eqUipped With ultraviolet cameras, which mom tor tne solar wllldS . . 

For best viewing of the comet, Houpis recommends travelli ng as 
far away from city lights as possible. With 7x50 binoculars, he said . 
one should be able to see the comet on a moonless night by facing 
due east at about 9 pm and looking up 45°. A small cluster of stars 
should appear in the upper left hand corner of the field of vision, 
and three stars, one beneath the other, lower ancl in the center. The 
comet, to the right of the upper twO stars, is vety dull at this time, 
like a small "fuzzy dot of cotton consistency: Houpis said . The comet 
should be most visible in December and January unt il j une. The tail 
should be visi ble between January and March. 

Professional "comet parties" are scheduled by the P-:uben H. Aeet 
Space Center for December 9 and 13. Anyone interested should 
contact Clint Hatchett at the Space Center. 

The discussion with Dr. Houpis was part of a lecture series 
sponsored by the AS. ~

What women need: 
comniitee will research 
By lAUREN FRESH, Staff Writer 

In an attempt to respond to 
the needs of women students on 
campus. the administratipn has 
called together an advisoty 
committee on women's issues. 

The goals of this commmee 
are threefold: fi rst, the group will 
discern services already available 
to women at UCSD; second, it 
will determine what needs the 
women students have for these 
services and which of their 
needs are unrnet; and finally, the 
commJttee will suggest to the 
Registr'dtion Fees Committee 
ways to satisfy these with a new 
department, staffing or funding. 

Mary Virga of Legal Services 
will head the campUS-Wide 
adviSOry group. Studem 
representatives will be selected 
by a student adviSOry committee 
directed by Marie Steckbauer, a 
student representa tive to' the 
Registration Fees Committee . 
"This committee should ensure 
that the admin istration will be 
responsive to students from a 
services point of view ... (It is) a 
commitment to the recognition 
of a subject that has been 
ignored: said Nick Aguilar. 

Joseph Watson , vice-
chancellor of undergraduate 
affairs, said that the needs of 
women have been met through 
"the regular channels of 

supponive services." "There has 
been no need demonstrated for a 
women's center," he said. The 
committee is intended ' to make 
the university aware of problems 
and needs which have previously 
gone unrecognized , he said . 

Three centers exist on campus 
where issues speCific to women 
can be answered: the Women's 
Clinic at Student Health Se rvices, 
Counseling and Psychological 
Service downstairs in the 
Humanities/ Libraty Building and 
the Women's Resource Center. 

The Women's Resource Center 
offers peer counse ling, support 
groups and i nformalion for 
women who feel confronted 
politically, psychologically or 
emotionally with their sexuality, 
accordillg to Patty Orozco, a peer 
counselor of the center. In its 
121h year of ope ra tion, this 
student-run collective provides 
the women of UCSD with 
suppon and information about 
women's issues, Orozco said . 

Because the cemer is a student 
organization and therefore has 
no staff funded by the 
administration through 
registration fees, it cannot 
maintain cominuity in serving 
the women of UCSD, Orozco 
said . After the adviSOry

returns its results, the center may 
obtain a staffing o r programming 
budget from the administration. 

According to Orozco. a core of 
12 women now staff the center. 
Six of these are peer counselors 
who receive some compensation 
for their work from the 
Psychological Services. All staff 
members volunteer some time to 
suppo rt administra tion and daily 
operation . 

Both the Women's Resource 
Cente r and some members of the 
Associated Students have 
advocated rund ing full-time sta lf 
members at the center, paid out 
of registraion fees. Jill Lifschiz . 
vice president , fi nancial of the 
AS. said she hopes that "If and 
when" the funding comes 
through from the registration fees 
committee, that women will 
know that the Women's C~ nter 
is available. 

The AS has increased the 
advertising budget of the center 
this year so women will become 
more aware of the services that 
are available to them , Lifschiz 
said . "Any woman should know 
that if she needs help with a 
women's issue that she can go to 
the Women's Resource Center. 
The connection should be 
immedia te. You go to Student

Student summit on 
Financial aid 

Financial Aid was the tOp 
agenda item of the Second 
National Student Summit held in 
Washington, D.C. November 15-
19. Student, higher education 
and government leaders from 
coast to coast pa nici pated in the 
five- day summit that planned to 
develop a com prehensive 
national agenda defining the 
future direction of student aid 
programs. 

The program was sponsored 
by the Umverslty tudent Senate, 
City Umversl ty of ew York 
CUSS-CUNY). USS-CUNY has 
become one of the leading 
student lobbying organizations 
workmg on mcreasmg support 
for financial aid programs 

"Student aid must become the 
number one priority for all 
student leaders," said Melvin E. 
Lowe, USS chai rperson. 'Students 
must have reasonable access to 
resources in order to attend 
co llege, particula rly from the 
federal government." 

According to Lowe, under 
President Reagan's budget 
proposals for student aid that 
failed in Congress last spring, 
conservative estimates predicted 
that almost half of aU students at 
his un iversity have been affected 
in one way and over 20.000 
students would not have been 
able to return to school at all. 

"These kinds of cuts have to 
be stopped ," said Lowe. "Besides 
the president'S lack of 
committment to higher education 
111 fund ing current programs, he 
has taken no initiative in the 
reauthorization process." 

The HIgher Education Act of 
1965 (HEA), which proVIdes the 
majonty of federal student aid 
for postsecondary education is 
due for reauthorization this 
Congress. During the 
rea uthonzation process, key 
issues in the student aid 
programs will be discussed. They 
Include: 

I ) Whether to make any 
major changes affecting 
ehgibility o r federal COSt in the 
current Title N programs. 
2) Whether more aid should 
go directly to the students or 
the schools in which they 
attend. 
3) Whether to continue the 
authorization for a number of 
HEA programs that are nor 
currently funded by Congress. 
The Congressional Research 

Service indicated last year, 
student aid programs under HEA 
made available about $13 billion 
to low and middle Income 
students. "If these programs are 
changed , millions of students 
would be affected ," said Lowe. 
"It's time that students speak up

An 'Affimlative' request for further 'Action' 
A searing debate had developed in the past few years as to whether 

or not affirmative action programs have become useless public folly . 
From the extremely vi ible attacks on civil rights tenets launched by 
Attorney General Ed Meese's Justice Department, to the more obscured 
promotion of rugged individualism as the remedy for racial 
discrimination , the present state of the affirmative action principle is 
undergoing a catharsis of sorts. The major premise for launching 
affirmative action programs during the late 60s - that racial 
discrimination is the most important r~ason for the underrepresentation 
of ethnic minorities in lucrative professions (and prestigious universities 
in our case) - is being severely undermined by both an avalanche of 
statistics that seek to prove the futility of enforced quotas in advancing 
the plight of the underrepresented and the lack of an innovative 
campaign on the part of those who uppon the aforementioned 
programs. 

affirmative action necessites is a volatile investment at best. Consider, 
then , allowing a market that is monopolized by Anglo compan ies a free 
hand in determing where the wealth is distributed. America has not yet 
10 t its propensity for stupidity born out of greed and exclusion ism. 

The question remains as to how UCSD is fighting discrimination 
and / or informal segregation. It appears as if many underrepresented 
students here feel they are fighting for their community's survival, rather 
that its continuning advancement. There is no truly assimilated white -
ethnic community here on campus and very few people on the majority 
side are busting down any doors to dispel this abhorrent situation. 
Unlike that of many other public universities, our ethnic community is 
geographically isolated from the fellow people of color being so locked 
in by La Jolla. This may be why the white community on campus is a 
bit too satisfied with the state of race relations - we don't believe there 
is dissent for because La Jolla stifles our sensitivity. 

At UC D, where underrepresented enrollment is gradually decreaSing, 
where targeted retention rates are falling shon of their goals and where 
the white community virtually ignores the existence of a racial problem , 
the debate at the federal level seems to be very far away. For it is far 
easier to show a crowd of high-browed intellectuals in Washington that 
the history of affinnative anion programs in the counn)' points to an 
increasingly tagnated minority economic sector that it is to show an 
unemployed someone living in a barrio or ghetto . A similar analogy can 
be applied to UC D, where the average white student will more easily 
swallow the tatement that "racial discrimination docs not exsist on 
campu ," than will an underrepresented person working with the 
tudent Afrirmative Action Committee (SMC). oW, if it could be shown 

that UCSD's groups of blacks, Latins, Asians and American Indians have 
been highly succes ful in their coursework. social lives and work-lives in 
spite of racial discrimination and without the benefit of affirmative 
action. then the necessity of such organizat ions like the MC and EOP 
(Early Outreach Program) would be cast in doubt. However, such 

On the other side though , our affirmative action brothers and sisters 
do not feel that UCSD is so wonderfully progressive. Some of their 
thoughts on the subject indicated that the white community has not 
come very far in making them feel like welcome participants in UCSD 
culture. In fact, it is our majority population that has hesitated in 
exploring the events put on by affirmative action students, thereby 
limiting the cultural focus of UCSD as a whole. If we do hope to become 
a "colorless society," all of our citizens must come fOIWard to prevent the 
further slaughtering of our yet-to-prosper affirmative action programs. 
The way to progression is not through the heartless judgements of the 
free market, but through carefully applied programs that were set up to 
protect the people who are bound to advance. 

success rates are not the case, neither on a national or university level. 
The attacks on the viab ility of affirmative action programs can presently 
be seen as nothing more that another priva te economic invasion of the 
most repulsive son, where formerly dominant Anglo sectors are 
beginning to react against growing ethnic competition in the 
marketplace (and this includes the university sphere). 

Considering the experience of growing ethnic communities in the 
United States, one would think that even our most pure-hearted social 
planners would not stoop to believe that the barriers of prejudice have 
been torn down. To think that the "free market" (which, by the way, did 
ItS very best to develop the agency of slavery to fit into its economic 
schemes) is the answer and the only true campaigner for equal rights , is 
absurd . Equal opportUnity under the law. in principle , is a necessary 
amendment. However, to trust an Anglo-dominated government with the 
enforcement of such a provision , is quite ri sky. Moreover, the 
entrustment o[ this govern ment with the distribution of a va riety of

Playboy purity 
Editor: 

This IS an unsoliCited, yet, I 
feel , absolutely necessary reply to 
Ms Kathy Beckett's anicle of 18 

ovcmber "To tum your anger 
outward " Kudos first for a 
subject well-covered, yet I feci 
she has erred in one major 
respeu by lumping Playboy 
magazine together with Hu stler, 
Penthouse and the like 
Spwlically, she wrote , "In 
magazines such as Hu stler, 
Playboy and Penthouse , wome n 
are commonly portrayed as 
victims of violence and rape -
and are often depicted as 
enjoying the violence." Hmm ... 

Kathy, when was the last tlme 
you actually read Playboy? 

Have you ever rcad one, or are 
you JUSt quotIng someone else 's 
jingoistIc gut-level reaction 
towards presenting women In 
anything but a clothed manner? 

I have been an avid , near 
rabid reader of Playboy for almost 
20 years, since my ~est friend 
and 1 discovered a targe 
collecllon In hiS older brother's 

room sometime in the sixth 
grade. The life-long lesson from 
that for me has been that 
anatomically women are quite 
different from men (and viva la 
difference to that) , and forgive 
me for being heterosexual and 
nonandrogynous if that offends 
you and your like , but 1 for one 
do read Playboy (with both 
hands), finding their humor, 
SOCial insights, fiction, et ., of 
the highest rank, and never have 
1 seen women portrayed 
(commonly or otherwise) as 
victims of violence or rape, but 
they are commonly portrayed as 
beautiful, intelligent, tender and 
someone 1 wouldn't at all mind 
"bringing home to mom ." 

I think there's something 
rather insidious in the movement 
by said moron majority types to 
ban all expression of sex and 
nudity, and was glad to read that 
Ms. Simonton does not ally 
herself with that view. 

If you (Kathy and anyone 
readIng thiS), is at all aware of 
the battles Playboy has been 
fighting against the forces of 

censorship in this country, 
battles for equal rights and sexual 
expression, you wouldn't have 
~ncluded it with the others. 

I feel , further, that you're on 
the right tl"Jck, uplevehng the 
awareness of women (as well as 
men), that they are more than 
sex-objects or meat (I , for onc , 
am glad 1 don 't have a 
physiological sexual response to 
looking at the meat section at 
Ralphs, 1 pity those who do), 
and don't have to pander to that 
side of human nature to get 
noticed .

OPINIONS 

The unacceptable choices of a crowded university 
By SHELLY SIMMONS 

Somewhere along the line, 
UCSD has missed its mark. 
There was a time when 
universities were developed to 
best suit the educational interests 
of their students and not the 
financial interests of the 
operators. Well, it seems those 
utopian days are gone. 

This is my 13th quarter at 
UCSD. According to my 
calculations, next quarter was to 
be my laSt. I would have 
completed reqUirements for and 
beyond my major - Animal 
Physiology. My parents and I 
have invested over $7,000 in this 
institution of higher learning, in 
addition to my countless hours 
of study and hard work. Now it's 
time for me to leave. I'm ready 
and I'm more than willing ·to take 
my degree and go out smiling. 
But it's not going to happen , not 
if the school administrators have 
their way. 

Thursday, November 14, was 
the day when most seniors were 
to tum in their pre-registration 
forms for winter quarter, 
including the necessary 
department stamps. When this 
senior went to get her form 
stamped by the Biology 
Department, she was signed ontO 
a waiting list of 20 students for a 
laboratory class that allows for 
only 96 students. This lab is the 
only one offered in the winter or 
spring for Animal Physiology 
majors, other than the one we in 
the business of studentry can 
"Death Wish N ." 

When I presented my 
dilemma to the department 
secretary, i.e., that it was 
absolutely imperative that I get in 
this class in order to graduate in 
the winter, I was instructed to 
"go to class and see what the 
professor says." I wasn't about to 
let my future dangle for eight 
weeks just to be told that "the 
first four people on the waiting 
list will be allowed in, but the 
rest of you are out of luck," -
out of luck, out of money, our of 
patience and out of time. 

My only resource appeared to 
be to confront the professor, who 
shall remain nameless (which 
seems only appropriate since to 
many professors, most students 
are but nameless faces). 

Eventually, I cornered this busy 
man and threw myselt on his 
proverbial mercy, thinking, how 
could he not do something about 
the si tuation with 20 unhappy 
se niors breathing down his 
neck? 

"Forry-nine ." 
Make that 49 unhappy seniors 

on the waiting list at last COUnt, 
accordi ng to the updated 
professor. After much excuse-
making on said professor's part 
about available space and the 
unexpected number of students 
in the major this year (which he 
must have known about all this 
quarter), he presented me with 
some options: 1) that I change 
my major to General Biology 
(which would mean that I wasted 
precious effort in some difficult 
classes with the vain expectation 
of seeing "Animal Physiology" on 
my invisible diploma); 2) that I 
take a "similarly rigorous" course 
at a nearby university or junior 
college (which would mean 
trying to balance a semester lab 
there with eight quarter units 
and a job here, and st ill graduate 
in the winter); or 3) that I return 
next year and again wait in a 
futile line to not get into the one 
class I still needed to graduate. 
With these suggestions I was 
shrugged off with a sorrowful 
"there's-nothing-I-can-do-it's-out-
of-my-hands" glance. I couldn't 
go over his head to the 
department adviser because he is 
the department adviser. The 
proVOSt counselors told me to 
talk to my professor. 

I underhandedly confronted 
my T.A. with the hope that he 
could somehow squeeze my 
name in between the lines of the 
roll book, but he said he was 
powerless. But he did give me 
the name of the "woman-in-
charge-of-those-things" in the 
biology department. I established 
an appointment with her 
secretary and the next day 
confronted the woman-in-charge 
with my problem. 

At first she seemed eager to 
help. But after a few minutes of 
calmly discussing the matter, we 
both became beligerent - I was 
pressing for changes to be made, 
for something to be done, for 
students to be compensated; she

was retaliating with charges that 
if'l really wanted to get in the 
class, I should have skipped my 
class and been biting and 
scratching in line with my 
salivating peers at 7:30 in the 
morning, fighting for a higher 
SpOt on the waiting list. She also 
asserted that my friends should 
have told me about the yearly 
struggle that takes place over 
spaces in the class. "I always 
thought it was the lore among 
the students ... ," she said. Well I 
guess I must have been busy 
studying to get into the class 
rather than gossiping about 
registration labyrinths. The 
woman told me that this same 
problem reoccurred every year 
that she had been at UCSD 
which was a grand total of three. 
I told her I've been here five 
years and yes, it's reoccurred 
every year. Is that supposed to 

be an excuse? Is that supposed 
to appease me? Isn't it about 
time that the department and 
university got a clue and reacted 
to the situation? Her response to 
this was that one thing we tty to 
teach students here is how to 
deal with bureaucracies and 
confUSing systems and that I 
should learn that I'm not always 
going to get what 1 want and 
what makes me so special that 1 
should bump some other poor 
student out of the class and that 
no one has time to make sure 
that all the students in the class 
were indeed graduating seniors, 
etc. 

I tried to explain to her that I 
was fighting not only for my 
rights, but for a bener system for 
all the students who would not 
graduate because of the present 
first-come-first-served criteria. 
When 1 told her that I thought 
the university was based on

helping and educating students 
not on giving them the run-
around , she told me in so many 
words that I was wrong, and that 
I wouldn't find things different at 
any other univerSity. I guess that 
makes it okay then. Another 
comforting remark. I thanked her 
lor her time alter she put me on 
a waiting list for some other lab 
that I could take if I were to 
change my malor, and left. 

After being bounced about in 
this Catch-22 long enough, I 
phoned Daddy to have him 
scope out the economic pressure 
points and pull the proper 
monetary strings. After all, what's 
education all about , anyway? 
Making the bucks, right? There 
are two ways to look at it, I 
guess. Either fine, upstanding-in-
the-university-world UC5D 
overenrolls students every year so 
that many more of them can 

gain the elusive "higher 
education ," or UCSD overenrolls 
so that many more registration 
fees can be coneeted. 

It seems to me that this 
university'S bureaucratic system 
is nor exactly student-friendly. 
UCSD began as a solely graduate 
campus, and rumor has it that 
our founding faculty were not too 
keen on the idea of catering to a 
bunch of uneducated 
undergraduates. Some of those 
early fossils of prej udice can still 
be found on campus today. 
Shouldn't an institution that 
Structures majors with such 
extensive and intensive courses 
be able to offer those courses to 
all who wish to take them, or at 
least present some feasible 
alternatives that would still allow 
for graduation in one's desired 
major within a maximum five-
year period? 1 do not feel 
that in my final quarter at UCSD 

1 should be intimidated into 
changing my major for the lack 
of one required laboratory 
course. Nor do I feel that I 
should be forced off campus [0 
find a course that fits a UCSD 
requirement. And surely I should 
not be sentenced to return here 
next winter, to pay a full quarter's 
tuition, to enroll for one 
laboratory class that 1 may get 
shut out of - again. Dilemma 
deja vu? No thanks. 

-My disdain and indignation 
arise here not only for myself, 
but for those 48 other seniors 
who will be directed off campus 
next quarter; or who will rerum a 
year from now to complete their 
four outstanding units; or who 
will take Death Wish IV, fail or 
dropout, and will return next 
year anyway; or who will 
capitulate to the inevitability of 
being general biology majors. 

Hundreds of sentors each 
quarter are faced with these 
same uncceptable choices. Can't 
something be done about the 

. repeated overcrowding of classes 
and overenrollment of freshmen? 
Could classrooms and facilities 
be used more efficiently? Could 
requirements for certain majors 
pose more feasible options? 
Could more professors be hired, 
or could the ones we have at 
least be distributed more 
equitably? Someone somewhere 
in a position of authOrity has gOt 
to draw the line between where 
funds and profits overlap with 
proper education. It would be 
nice if those someones could be 
the oppressed undergraduates, 
themselves, but our opinions 
don't always carry the weight 
they should in bureaucratic 
matters. 

We wouldn't pay the fees if we ' 
didn 't want to be here. But when 
the learning is through, we've 
earned and deserve the privilege 
of taking away a diploma that 
most suitably deSCrIbes the time 
and effort invested in obtaining 
it. If we are denied that privilege, 
something has to be done, 
because the university is no 
longer serving its main function 
- to educate students and 
prepare them for life "on the 
outside." rm

First, I should immediately 
state that I definitely agree that 
he is a racist; he has been 
repeatedly refering to Arabs, or 
more specifically to Palestinians, 
as "dogs." 

Second, I would like to add 
that he is a terrorist since he was 
the founder of the infamous 
jewish Defense League ODL), 
known for its numerous murder~ 
and crimes. (Lately, the FBI 
linked it to the assassination of 
Alex Odeh, a member of the 
Arab-American anti-
discrimmation committee .) 

Furthermore, he is a hypocrite 
and a demagogue; though 
everyone has seen his on-record 
description of the Arabs as 
"dogs," he did not have the 
courage to reiterate what he 
really thinks and proclaims in 
rallies and meetings about Arabs. 
When he was interviewed on 60 
Minutes and Night/ine a few 
weeks ago , he even cynicaUy told 
Mike Wallace: "I respect the 
Arabs, that's why I want them 
out. 11 

Then, afte r all this , why am I 
saying the aforementioned letter 
missed the point about Kahane? 

That is because its writers failed 
to understand the (valid) point 
Kahane is making: Israel cannot 
be a 'Jewish state" and a 
"democratic state" at the same 
time , and Zionism requires that 
Israel be a Jewish state . 

All the Israeli officials 
interviewed on 60 Minutes and 
on Nightline had the vision to 
realize this dilemma and 
admitted that Zionism provides 
no answer to it. They just 
"hoped" that a solution can be 
found , which would somehow 
reconcile between the necessity 
of democracy and the 
requirement of Jewry of the state . 

Today, the jewish leaders are 
avoiding the question . The fact 
that one (I) Knesset member is 

The home of the U'~t'f.m 
i In 39¢ hamburger 

an Arab seems to convince them 
that Israel can be a democratic, 
and jewish state . The malaise 
inside of Israel (the growing 
polarization over Kahane's ideas) 
is a clear sign that there is a 
problem in the Zionist ideology. 

I do not want to be 
misunderstood. All I want is for 
people to realize the importance 
of the point Kahane raises. It 
should also be clear that his 
"solution" (Arabs either 
converting to judaism in order to 
become Israeli citizens, or 
leaving "his" country) is 
ridiculous. 

As shown in the aforecited 
interviews, the (open-minded) 
Jews are finally beginning to 
realize one of the ideological 

flaws of Zionism. That is what 
anti-Zionists have been trying to 
point out since the emergence of 
that movement.

Affirmative action: Watson'sview 
By MAlT tAIT, scaff Wnrcr 

D R. JOSEPH WATSON discussed his role with repect to UCSD 
afTirmative action in an interview 
Friday, November 22. Watson 
stated his commitment to "enroll 
underrepresented students to the 
university in number reflective of 
the populatlon and have them 
succeed and graduate." 

"There is a current throughout 
the country that says minorities 
have gotten too much," said 
Watson. A lot of people have this 
notion that Affinnative Action 
means reverse discrimintaiton 
and the thing I would probably 
emphasize is that all Affinnative 
Action does is extend the 
welcome to a more diverse 
group," said Denise Miura of the 
Student Affirmative Action 

Committee (SMC). 
Watson refuted allegatlons that 

his recruitment policy is aimed 
at wealthy minorities saying, 
"Our recruitment policy is 
designed to get the best students, 
wherever they may be . The 
univerSity has an obligation to all 
students in California regardbs 
of what high school they go 
through. Any student who meets 
the UC admissions requirements, 
we are ready to enroll," Watson 
said. 

If there are any problems with 
the program, the SAAC office is 
designed to advise the vice 
chancellor, said Nadir Haqq of 
SAAC. "Dr. Watson has 
expressed on several occasions 
that he looks for input from this 

committee and wants to wcrk 
very closely with It; therefore, our 
input should have some type of 
impact," Haqq said. 

Watson said that students 
with complaints should file them 
"through the proper channels" 
and that "there are committees 
which are deeply concerned 
about having input about what 
the problems are." Public 
discussion of Affirmative Action 
is destructive to the program, 
according to Watson . 

The retention of minority 
students at UCSD, accord ing to 
Watson , "is good but could be 
better." By improving the quality 
of the studnts lives, he hopes to 
increase retention , Watson said .

Roving through the multi-colored gowns 
By DANIEL THOMAS , caff Wnrcr 

Resplendent in their robes, makes their robes In a hghter 
caps, gowns and tassels of shade of cnmson, so that the 
academia, UCSD faculty senior scholars In their older 
members and official guests robes won't feel faded next to 
opened the 25th AnnIversary the younger feUow ." The entire 
ConvOCatiOn, Monday, ~ovembcr robing room was filled with the 
18, at 4 pm, With a processIOn buzz of Similar light banter a 
headed by Professor James K. the professors relaxed pnor to 
Lyon, bearing before him the the pro<.:essional. 
trident of the Triwns. MUSIC of I approached Dr. Ralph LeWin , 
the an Diego Brass Quintet professor of biology at Scnpps 
resounded through Mandeville InstitullOn of Oceanography, and 
Audl!onum a 74 professors, led asked him about his robe of red 
by Dr. Lyon , were followed by 25 and beige, and especially his 
professors, participants and remarkable beret. He said the 
guests led by Professor Fred I oel beret was for the" cD" (Doctor 

DaVId Gardner, UC PreSIdent-the Ulllvasll> budget exceeds the 
budgets oj 21 stmes 

Spiess (chairman of the 
Academic Senate , San Diego 
DiVIsion). The 99 robed figures , 
mostly men, marched down the 
right aisle and filed OntO the 
stage w take their places In rows 
of waiting seats. It was an 
academic ritual event, the likes 
of wh ich are rarely seen In this 
West Coast public university. 

Many faculty participants had 
rented robes for the occasion 
from a certai n cap-and -gown 
outfi t that IS well known to any 
graduating student of high 
school or college. While 
circulating in the robing room 
before the ceremony, James 
Ralph Papp, a UCSD graduate 
and a former Guardran editor 
poi nted out to this reporter the 
familiar paper wrappings In 
which the mortarboard caps had 
been supplied , and remarked 
that "most of the black robes 
with velvet stripes are generic 
robes hired for the occasion ." 

Mr. Papp and I then made it 
our bUSiness to approach some 
of the more unusual robes and 
caps, to ask them their particular 
Significance. Dr, Edward 
Reynolds, professor of history, 
Informed us that his grey and 
black robe with blue trim was 
representative of the University 
of London. Two professors in 
crimson, pleated robes confirmed 
that they were Harvard 
graduates: one, Dr, Donald T. 
Westing, professor and chairman 
of the literature department, said 
he owned his robe; the other 
gendeman, who would identify 
himself only as "Dr. Woody Allen 
of biochemistry" (there is no 
such department or professor at 
UCSD) sa id , "Each year Harvard 

of Science) degree from 
Cambridge University in 
England, the highest "not 
honorary" degree awarded there. 
As he rather simply put it , "After 
years and years of study, you 
submit aU your works to a 
committee , and they can award 
the degree." He was a student In 
Downing College there. 

James Papp then remarked to 
Dr. Lewin, "Of course, you can't 
have been put in prison or 
anythi ng like that". "and tv our 
surprise , Dr. Lewin, smiling quite 
mischievously, launched into a 
Story of how he had done just 
that, once. "I was out with a 
group of botanists on a trip from 
Arizona to MeXICO, and when the 
Mexicans discovered I was 
Bri tish , they put me in prison 
because I didn 't have a proper 
visa . They assessed me a $60 
fine which the students had to 
pay. It was my only experience 
in prison and fortu nately 
Down ing College hasn't heard 
about it." I was rather struck by 
this Story, but quickl)l changed 
the subject to Dr. LeWin's robe. 
"My mother gave it to me ... 
she's always been quite proud of 
me , and she still is, at the age of 
96." As for his lifelong dedication 
to biology, Dr. Lewin ~emarked , 
"I couldn't possibly be interested 
in anything else. Ever since the 
age of three I've been interested 
in biology." 

There were a few more 
distinctive berets in the group, 
but I was reluctant to interrupt 
their conversations with other 
faculty members, and thus, I was 
unable to discover whether they, 
too, were Cambridge Doctors of 
Science. However, Dr. Mary 

Walshok, adjunct assoctate 
professor of SOCiology and dean 
of UC D extenSion, gave a 
relevant sociological cornment on 
the wearing of convocation 
robes. "Major transitions in 
family , society and insti tutions 
need rimal celebrations. ThiS IS 
why we wear the robes and 
velvet capes" 

Father Phillip J. Cunningham, 
who was to give the mvocation, 
told me that previously, in hi s 12 
years wi th John Hopki ns 
University in Maryland , "they 
had these (academic evems in 
robes) every time you turned 
around ," bur in his SIX years with 
the Office of ReligIOUS Affairs 
here ("not actuaU), with the 
universlt}' itself') and not 
couming graduation ceremonies, 
this was the first time he had 
ever witnessed such a robed 
evem. He agreed that thiS was 
partly due to rhe difference 
between East Coast and West 
Coast, but noted also the 
difference ber-veen private and 
publIc unrversitles 

place on ovember 18, 1960 has 
been our gUide ever since." And , 
"The other key figu re (m the 
development of UC D) ... w~.s 
Clark Kerr." Lastly, the chancellor 
noted , "For UCSD to flourish .. . 
we must follow the traditions of 
the founders of this university, to 
seek OUl and encourage talented 
and creative faculty." 

President of the University of 
California David Gardner, then 
gave his remarks, causi ng 
somewhat of a stir In the 
audience when he pointed out 
that the budget of the university 
as a whole "exceeds that of all 
but 29 states in this Union." He 
contInued by pOInt ing out four 
areas in which the universi ty 
must grow: population, minority 
representation, new educati onal 
diverstty and philosophy and 
new instructional technology. 

Following President Gardner's 
remarks, Professor Roy Harvey 
Pearee rose to award the Revelle 
Medal to Dr. Clark Kerr, past 
preSident of the un ive rsity. 
Professor Pearce concluded With 

fo r San Diego were very 
unpopular with other parts of the 
university ... but (these 
expenditures and omplaints) 
were eventually dwarfed by 
results achieved here ." 

Finally, Dr. Kerr lauded Roger 
Revelle for his part in the 
development of UCSD. "Roger 
had the great dreams ... the 
fantastic energy ... the exquisite 
judgement .. .... 

At th is point Clark Kerr turned 
to where Revelle was sitting, and 
the large audience in Mandeville 
auditorium rose to give Dr. 
ReveUe a standing ovation , which 
d id not SLOp until he had 
approached the podium to 
respond to th e simple, yet we ll 
deserved approbation. Speaking 
extemporaneously, Revelle 
modestly sa id , "This univerSity 
was not built by an individual, 
bur by a team. They all deserve 
recognrtion. I'm kind of a symbol 
of a whole group of people who 
used their loyalty and 
imagmation to achieve thIS 
university." 

Noted faculty and adminislration at the anniversary convocatio n. 

The professors were called to 
order as I left to take a seat in 
the auditorium. The impressive 
academic procession followed 
shortly thereafter with Dr. Clark 
Kerr, past president of the 
University of California, walking, 
at his own speci fic request , next 
to Dr. Roger Revelle , the man 
without whom UCSD might 
never have taken form, and for 
whom th is 25th anni ve rsary must 
have been particularly a 
poignant, and yet satisfyi ng, 
moment. 

FollOWing the proceSSion , the 
nati onal anthem was played , and 
Protessor ::'ptess then welco med 
all parties and guests to the 
convocation. Reverend 
Cunni ngham now delivered the 
Invocation, praying that the life 
"for the universe and for the 
university tomorrow, might bri ng 
the new dawn of peace and not 
simply lake us one step nearer to 
armageddon." 

Remarks by UCSD Chancellor 
Richard C. Atkinson were then 
given. The ehanceUor noted the 
key roles played by both Revelle 
and Kerr. "Roger (Revelle) had a 
clear understanding of how to 
build a great university, as he 
often said, 'from the tOP down.' 
... the tradition of excellence in 

an appropriate birthday remark, 
"In honoring him , we honor 
UCSD." 

The convocation address was 
now delivered by Dr. Kerr, who 
was president of the university 
when UCSD was founded . He 
spoke of the miracle of rapid 
development and rise to 
distinction of UCSD, "one of the 
few academic marvels of our 
time." He described how an 
entire new university in Japan 
has now been modeled after 
UCSD. President emeritus Kerr 
drew a pleasant laugh from the 
auditorium when he began his 
version of the history of UCSD 
with the words, "In the 
beginning, there was the 
Univers ity of California at 
Berkeley." He then told how "in 
1957, a graduate school of 
science and technology (here) 
received its fi rst academic 
appointment ... (but) these plans 
seemed inadequate ". (there 
came a) shift from a small to a 
large research university, and to 
the consternation of some in the 
smaU academic community, of aU 
things, undergraduate students ," 
who were fi rst admitted in 1964. 

Kerr then LOld of increasing 
budget allowances for UCSD, and 
how "these favorable decisions 

Following the secondary 
applause , ChanceUor Atkinson 
stepped to the podium for his 
closing remarks, and read two 
telegrams of congratulation , one 
from Governor George 
Deukmej ian , a second from 
President Ronald Reagan . 

The guests in the auditorium 
then remained seated as the 
brass quintet played a fanfare , 
and the academic gowns and 
robes left the stage to march up 
the aisle in a recessional parade. 

After the convocation there 
was a reception in the south 
terrace of Mandeville Center. 
Faculty and guests mingled 
together and crushed toward 
buffet tables lhat were loaded 
with delicious, aromatic food . 
According to Bob Leonetti, a 
UCSD psychology graduate who 
now works with Alex Fairchild's 
catering service, the spread 
included: basil torra (cream 
cheese and whipped butter 
layered with basilk pesto); sruffed 
mushroom caps topped with 
swiss cheese; teriyaki beef 
skewers; a hot chicken salad 
made with zucchin i, crook 
squash and spinach leaves; a hot 
pasta salad; fru it and cheese

Model-muggings 
teach defense 
By MONTE ROSEN, Slaff Wn ler 

Violence is the fin al aCI that 
degrades a human being into an 
object. Violence against women 
is the final ac t of a sexist society 
degrading her completely mLO a 
Victim. Rape is the most 
prevalent ac t of violence against 
women , and if you think it won't 
happen to you, think again. 
Bet\veen one in every ten and 
one in every three women is 
raped in her life, The tatlstics 
vary according to who compIles 
them, but a rape occurs on an 
average of every 30 seconds in 
this country. 

Since 1979, six rapes have 
occurred on-campus, and though 
the assa ilants arc usually 
caught- which isn't the case 
nationally-this fact docs little to 
prevent rapes, nor does it ensure 
repara tion to those a lready 
raped. The array of aftersho ks 
for rape victims include 
depression, guilt, shame, inabili ty 
to trust or love, sexual 
dysfunction and relati onship 
breakup. Divorce and suicide are 
common after a rape. But rape 
lives for mOSl women , neither as 
aftershocks nor as statistics. 

Rape lives for most women as 
fear. The biological fac t of being 
a woman , "the weake r sex," has 
created a class of vicmns. 
Victims give up their power 
because of their fear. BlIt women 
are not victims by biological 

determ ination, they are victims 
hy choice. When the radical 
feminist ind ic ts the eve ryday 
occurrences as the cause of th IS 
victimization- in th e looks , In 
the language of paternali sm and 
sexism-she or he misses the 
role of chOIce. Yet, the historical 
set of choices has always been 
grim: submit or die. Now the 
choice IS different. 

Men who rape are generally 
insecure, inadequate people. Half 
of the women who resist in any 
way at all succeed in escaping or 
scaring off their attackers. 
Wouldn't :l woman's chance of 
victory be much greater if she 
we re to choose to ove rcome her 
viclim stigma, and replace it with 
a strong sense of self-worth that 
absolutely refused to be VIOlated, 
a prac ticed intuition, and a body 
that knew, Without thinking, all 
the moves of strategic counter-
attack] 

Carrying a weapon or a an of 
mace might work with the 
element of surprise, but this 
element usually works aga in!> t a 
woman, and the weapon likewise 
is turned on its owner. Martial 
arts are a deep source of practice 
which will lead eventually to the 
shedding of the sheeps' clothing, 
and self-defense classes arc 
conven ient and mfo rmatlve, but 
mostly ineffectual. So what 
works? 

Instuctor acts as the "mugger," 
dressed in heavy padded 
protectivc suits. He simulates 
potential rape situation, while a 
woman Instructor coaches the 
participants on how to defend 
them~elves The muggers are 
themselves intensively trained to 
work with the capabihtcs of the 
partici pants, ye t also to recogn ize 
when a woman delive rs a 
kno kout blow. He will not stOP 
thc attack until he or the coach 
feels such a strike has been 
delive red . 

The purpose IS to rra in a 

woman to know lor herself what 
a knock-out strike feels like , thc 
level of power she must focus 
and the accuracy of delivery. By 
providing her with an actual 
moving target and a safe, 
suppportive environment to 
practice in, she can move 
th rough a tnal-and-error perrod 
and gam a realIstic sense of her 

"What we arc teaching women 
to do is to knock Out an 
assailant in frve seconds, so that 
they <.:an go gCt help ," explainS 
Danlelle Evans, trainer m the 
Innovauve self-defense system 
known as Model Muggi ng. The 
system, whIch she teaches at the 
unsel Cliffs Aikido DOJo In 

Ocean Beach, origInated 13 years 
ago when Matt Thomas was 
teachmg Karate. A black-belt 
student of hiS, who had been 
studYing defense and attack 

. strategies for years, was brutally 
raped. 

Driven by the failure of hIS 
martial art to defend his pupIl, 
Thomas researched the general 
pattern of violent attacks on 
women. He found that men 
attack women differently than 
they attack men. They rely 
heavily on Intimidation , on a 
woman's choice to submit. More 
important, they inevitably throw 
women to the ground at some 
poi nt during the attack. From 
thiS postilion tradit ional Karate 
method s fall. Based on his 
find ings, Matt developed a 
course in self-defense specifically 
deSigned for women and based 
on fightIng from the ground. 

"Wome n have a natural 
reaction to an attack; their 
aJrenahn rushes. We Just need 
to take that adrenalin and use 
it," says Evans. "Adrenalin IS the 
body's natural preparauon to 
fight , and women can fighl We 
Just need the information as to 
where the Vital zones are and a 
few simple techniques." 

It IS the method of whipping 
up the adrenalin that makes thiS 
a unique class Model Mugging tS

martial arts and street fighting.

own power But whal women are 
up against IS their own lack of 
cognIzance of choices, their own 
fears and limits 

The "mugger" IS trained to 
push the women a little further 
with each attack scenano: "It 
becomes very real," says JulIo , a 
trained mugger By the third 
class, In addition to phYSically 
Jumping the women, the mugger 
starts usi ng vemal abuse. "I 
threaten the women by using all 
these words. Horefully, (It) will 
hit some kind 0 button Jl1 her 
lI fe. I try to make her really 
upset," says Julio. 

The more upset a woman 
becomes, the more authent ic the 
experience will be and the less 
likely that she will freeze with 
shock, should she have to deal 
with an ac tual attack. Holly, a 
participant, recalls, "It's reaUy 
horrible to have someone 
phYSically un you, screaming at 
you. It can be reaUy fil thy. Some 
women 'lose aU lheir fight. But in 
the course , the trainer is right 
there encourag:ng unt il you frght 
back. What thiS does IS 
reprogram your reponse, so that 
if someone IS callIng you a 
fucking bitch, Intead of 
paralyzing you It makes you 
mad, and that rage makes you 
fight. No one is pretending that 
all thiS is fun. I hated every 
minute of It, and I was mad that 
I even had to be in the class." 

The women in the group 
support each other through all 
the changes they achieve. They 
cheer each other on and shout 
encouragement. Women who 
have actually been attacked Since 
they took the class report lhal 
they hear women cheering them 
on as they fight to defend 
themsl'lves. Over 3900 women

Doing the 
hubbajubba 

By VAN HUTCHINSON 
"Hubba Jubba! HubbaJubba!" 

His foghorn voice boomed across 
the Muir tcnnis courts. He 
bellowcd after his detcrmined-
looking tennis studem served. 
"Good serve! That's it!" Bob Moss 
was enthusiastically happy. as 
usual. 

He is a lively charactcr, cvcn 
whcn vicwed from afar. HIS 
whole bclly shakcs from his 

earthquakc laugh. His cherubic 
face is offset by patches of grcy 
hair. and hi girth is befitting of 
one who freelances as "Rem-a-
Santa." 

But Christmas IS 365 days a 
year for UCSD physical 
education supervisor, Bob Moss. 
His jolly ho-ho and hi s famous 
trademark, "HubbaJubba," can 
be heard all the way from P&L. 
His Santa's sack of goodwill is 
always full . and his students say 
he gives everything he's got 10 
them. They are encouraged, 
cajoled. bellowed at. affirmed 
and loved by a man whose 
stated purpose in life is 10 
inspire self-confidence in 
everyone he meets. And his 
students love him in return. 

Peny Sew. a Third College 

resident adviser said. "Bob 
makes it fun w learn .... He 
really gets thc students going." 

Karen Rose . a Muir 
sophomore. commcnted, "Hc 
tcaches tenn is almost as a 
martial an . combining th'e 
mental, phYSi cal and spintual." 

Kelly Garton , a Muir freshman. 
laughed quietly. "I'm one ~o's 
not so gifted ill tennis. I 
transferred w Bob's secnon from 
another because he's so paticnt 
and affirming. Now I'vc 
improved a lot." 

To be reaching hundreds of 
studerKs each year for 14 years 
with that icvcl of Impact has 
undoubtedly had an effect on an 
institution where motivation . at 
best , is only studied In rats and 
pigeons. Bob Moss came to this 
campus in 1971 after teaching 
Black studies and biology In high 
school. In co llege he played 
baseball and football, and he was 
named "Most Outstanding 
Athlete" at SDSU hiS senior year. 
He st ill has an almost rcligious 
passion for baseball, and has 
"ordained" dozens of young 
people as offi cial umpires. 

Motivating people is what 
Moss likes to do best. His 
motivational tool is not just 
positive thinking or goal-setting; 
it's laughter. The more the better . 
In fact . he has PUt on whole 
seminars where participants 

couldn 't any more. He lives by 
the slogans on his ·seminar 
brochures and the posters 111 his 
offi ce: "Make two laughs and call 
me in the morning. A good belly 
laugh can :elieve stress." and 
"Laughing IS the kcy 10 self-
confidence." 

MOlivatlon . he feels , gocs 
beyond just feeling good at-the-
moment. His interest lies also in 
the accelerated learning of mOlor 
skills. He employs such 
t,"chniqucs in his evel)'day 
tenn is lessons. The students play 
"tennis without balls" as he puts 

pantomime the nght trokc in 
slow motion . He affirms, "Rome 
wasn't built in a day, either." 
With each mini-success. the 
student gets a Moss-sized dose 
of pOSitive feedback: "Whew!" or 
"Hubba Jubba!" reverberating oIT 
the walls of (he Muir apartments. 

Moss's current goal is to 
es tablish the 04SCS - The 
Office for Self-Confidence 
Services. He envisions an 
organization within the 
university for motivating stud ems 
and te ~ching them accelerated 
ac hlevcment skills. It will bc

done perfectly, as they walk 10 
class as they stand in Iinc at the 
bookSlOre. At the beginning of 
the course, each student is given 
his or her own special te nnis 
ball . which they decorate with 
their names and sometimes a 
symbol of the animal they see 
themselves as when they are 
winning. He gets them to chant 
actual sequences of muscle 
coordinations: 'Toss back ... 
pause ... POWI" If a certain 
stroke is poorly done, Bob comes 
over and helps the student 

staffed by student coordinators 
serving intcrnships and will 
reach out 10 the UCSD 
community with motivational 
and personal skill workshops. 
Plans have been laid for a 
fund raiser only Bob Moss could 
pull together - a "Laughathon ." 
Through six hours of contagious. 
belly-busting, side-splitti ng 
laughter, he hopes UCSD will be 
the new holder of the world 's 
record, and the event will 
generate funds for the 
participating student 
organizations and the 04SCS. ~

remembers his "experiences as a 
Bridge student as being unique 
because , you don't know what to 
expect from college because 
you've never been exposed to it. 
You go to Bridge and you 
experience all these things and 
you trip out, because so much is 
expected of you; working, going 
{Q classes and at the same time, 
SOCializing." 

Velasquez continues, "The 
main aspect of Bridge was to 
show you what to expect in 
college. Bridge and OASIS are 
mediums of resource that can 
help you out. I am a peer 
counselor now, because I wanted 
{Q convey my experiences to 
these new freshmen who had 
never been to college or never 
been exposed to the aspeCts of 
college life. Being a person of 
color, I wanted to teach and to 
show others what is out there for 
them, because I'm sure a lot of 
what has happened to me will 
happen to them also. I went 
th rough a diffi cult time , and I 

ex eptionally hard since the 
program is compacted into four 
weeks. Snyder says that she has 
"heard a lot of people say that if 
they can make it through 
Summer Bridge, they can make it 
through anything." 

But students get more out of 
Bridge than academics; they 
experience camaraderie as well . 
"Summer Bridge helps to bring 
people together quickly. 
Incoming freshmen who have 
partiCipated in the program not 
only know their way around 
campus, but have a network of 
friends by the fall quarter, and 
after Bridge, throughout the year 
they have OASIS peer counselors 
available to them " 

Not only does an OASIS 
counselor assist students 
academ ica lly, but he or she can 
also act as a student 
representative in dealing with 
university bureaucracy. 
Apparently these students have 
to go through a great deal of red 
tape as they enter the University, 

to have someone there to 
intervene for you rather than one 
lonely individual versus the 
massive bureaucracy." 
Perr counselors are continuing 
EOP/SM students who, after 
participating in Summer Bridge, 
continue to work during the sc hool 
year as counselors, study skills 
tutors or clerks in OASIS programs. 
Before a person can become an 
OASIS tutor or peer counselor, he 
or she has to take a course called 
TEP 196, or the Psychology of 
Teaching a nd Struc tu re of 
Information for Human Learning, 
which teaches the students to tutor 
other college srudents. 

Snyder says she became 
involved with the OASIS/Summer 
Bridge program because she had 
been working with Early 
Outreach, a program at the high 
school level, counseling and 
encouraging 10th and 11th 
graders towards furthering their 
education at the UC college level. 
"I wanted to continue to work 
with the same target group I had 
been conseling in hi~h school, 

summer months and from Buck 
when she speaks to special ' 
interest groups who visit the 
UCSD campus periodicaJly. 

Fernando Fajardo, UCSD 
freshman , heard about Bridge 
through academic admissions 
and attended the program this 
past summer. Though Fajardo is 
from Momerey Park, most 
Summer Bridge participams are 
from the San Diego and Imperial 
County areas. Fajardo said, 
"Summer Bridge made me feel 
more relaxed in coming to this 
school; I saw it as a way of 
getting to know people from San 
Diego before I went to a gigantic 
school. To see a familiar face in 
a crowd instead of a lot of blank 
faces , gives you a good feeling. 

I t's good to have can taCts 
like this; I have seen strong 
bonds form between people 
from Bridge, and," he adds, 
"you can't break these r-"I 
bonds." ~

Ritualistic mornings 
By PHIL LAUDER 

YOU GET UP, you go to school, you come home, you wake up all over again. 
Every day. Pretty simple, basic, 
boring rhythm. You'd think it 
would be easy after 17-25 years 
of doing close {Q the same thing. 
And , for the most part, it is. 
Sometimes school is tough , 
sometimes it's tough to make it 
back home in one piece, but in 
general the process is a smooth 
one. Except for one part. 

The first part. Getting your 
butt up and out of the house. 

There are days, I tell you, 
when there is nothing on God's 
sweet earth that's more physically 
and emotionally demanding than 
responding to that assinine 
alarm. You lay your head down 
after a long day's night, and you 
look at the clock and it says 
12:15 am, and you blink and 
some siron is screaming at you, 
insisting that it's 7: 15 in the 
morning, and you know there's 
no way. There is NO way! It's all a 
cruel hoax. You're no college 
idiot. Slam down the snooze 
button. You can't be fooled . 

The most creative moments of 
my life have occurred right after 
the alarm sounds as I desperately 
try to create some rationalization, 
any rationalization, for keeping 
my head on the pillow and my 
body under the warm and 
wonderful covers. And I have 
come up with - and employed 
- pretty much every excuse in 
the book. A large book, at thaL 

Probably in eight or ten volumes. 
If I'm getting up for a morning 

math class, I have to detennine 
how much value I would get out 
of attending this lecture anyway. 
Probably not that much -
certainly nothing I couldn't get 
from someone's notes later, right? 
Besides, feeling like this , I might 
fall asleep in class anyway -
boy would I feel sturid for 
embarrassing myse.l in front of 
classmates and for not simply 
staying in bed in the first place. 
Also, wouldn't it be better to get 
an additional hour or so of sleep 
and feel refreshed and more 
mentally prepared for the day at 
hand? Wouldn't I be more alert 
for my oth~r classes? Wouldn't I 
study better and spend less time 
doing it and retain more? Why 
of course I would , silly. What 
good does it do to be a zombie 
all day, huh? None at all! My 
God. I'd be stupid to get up now! 

End rationalization. I press the 
Set Alarm button, tap the Set 
Hour once (or twice), and smile. 
"Congratulations, you done 
good," I think, and immediately [ 
get back to the task at hand -
blissful unconsciousness. 

Other reasons for staying in 
bed include: the other night I 
only slept four hours, I can't 
function properly on seven hours 
sleep, lack of sufficient sleep 
leads to student burnout, math is 
a wonhless subject. .. . If those 

don't work, try these: It's raining, 
it's cold out, math can't really be 
learned anyway, the traffic's too 
heavy at this hour - wait a little 
while and it'll get better. Finally 
try these: It's sunny out, it's 
Monday, it's November 25 , the 
Chargers lost yesterday, there are 
enough people up in the world 
already, math should be 
boycotted. 

Sometimes the rationalization 
process getS intense , and 
sometimes downright ugly, so on 
some mornings it's better to 
avoid it altogether. This is 
successfully accomplished by 
simply switching the alarm off 
and not wonying your pretty 
little head over it. Blink again 
and it's 10:33. Good job. Damn 
good job. 

Of course , you don 't always 
want to give in to the magnetiC 
effect that anchors your body to 
the mattress. Sometimes you 
really want to get up and make it 
to class. You really do. And you 
get upset with yourself when you 
don't. But that doesn't change 
things next time. 

What happens after actually 
verticalizi ng follOWing several 
hours of pure horizontal ness is 
itSelf a strange, sometimes 
unconscious, and never 
wonderful ritual. The morning 
ritual. Most of us have several 
key tasks that need to get 
accomplished before we will set 
foot OUtSide the front door. 

Most people , I think, point 

themselves in the general 
direc,ion of the shower and shift 
themselves into first gear. 
Trouble is, they sometimes forget 
to tum the key, and simply fall 
back into bed. Eventually they 
make it to the bathroom, and the 
water goes on and signs of life 
begin to emerge from what was 
previously a lifeless blob. 

Some rely on other tricks to 
wake themse!ves up . Coffee is a 
popular one, probably the most 
popular. Juices are also good; a 
friend of mine is as helpless as a 
baby fresh out of the womb 
before her morning glass of 
orange juice. Shower, coffee , o.j., 
an ice cube in your underwear, 
whatever it takes - somehow, 
you gotta wake the hell up. 

Once awake, we plod through 
a mental checklist. The length of 
this list of tasks varies greatly, 
and is generally longer and more 
time-consuming for women than 
for men. Mine is pretty simple . 
Get up, get clean, get dressed, 
feed the dogs , eat something 
fairly unnutritious, brush my 
teeth and head out: elapsed time, 
30 minutes. If I'm in a huny, I'll 
miss a step or two. 

For some people there's 10 
such thing as missing a st .p or 
two. It's get up, take a shower, 
stare at the wardrobe , pick out 
an outfit, put lotions and 
aromatics on the bod while 
getting dressed, do makeup , dry 
hair, sryle hair, style hair some 
more, go to the kitchen and 
make coffee, pick up the paper, 
fix an egg and cheese omelet , ear 
it while reading the SPOrtS 
and/ or comics pages, brush 
teeth , fix makeup and hair again , 
and then leave (checking the 
mirror on the way out). Elapsed 
time: two hours and 45 minutes.

FEATURES 

This may sound like an 
exaggeration. If you don't know 
someone whose morning ritual is 
ar least two hours long, you 
probably don't know tOO many 
people. More likely you just 
never asked , because you never 
cared . Well , that's why I'm here. 
It's my job to care about things 
like this. 

Anyway, that's the morning 
ritual. Pretty standard, and a 
pretty autonomic process once 
you've made it OUt of bed. 
Standard, that is, until you wake 
up late one morning. 

You want to know how little 
time you can cram that morning 
rirual into? Wake up at 7:53 for 
one of your 8 am finals coming up 
in a couple weeks. You'll find out. 

It's called "the effect of raw 
panic on a poor human who 
isn't really conscious yet," a.k.a. 
"the two-minute-drill morning 
ritual." Twenty-eight seconds in 
the shower, thi rty-nine throwing 
clothes on, forty-two doing 
bathroom stuff (brushing teeth 
and hair and shaving or doing 
makeup), and 11 seconds to the 
front door. It's an incredible feat, 
defying the laws of physical 
movement through the 
dimension of time. Once 
accomplished , it gives you a 
sense of pride, a sense of what it 
must feel like to be God. "Hell, I 
can do anything if I can make it 
from my bed to my test in nine 
minutes." Panic is great stuff. 

Mornings can be the toughest 
part of the day, or the most 
panicked, or the most stupidly 
automatic if you both manage to 
get up and get up on time. 
Regardless , it seems there ought 
to be some alternative. 

Maybe rn try waking up in the 
afternoons. ~

Tritons lose in three straight 

LaVerne leaves Tritons in their dust 
By GUS SANTOYO, Slaff Writer 

U CSD'S women's volleyball team had beaten the University of laVerne 
in their previous four meetings 
this year in some real nail-biting 
matches. These same two 
volleyball powerhouses met in 
the NCAA Division III Western 
Regional Finals Saturday. In front 
of the hostile confines of the 
highly partisan crowd in the 
Triton Pit, laVerne wrenched a 
monkey the size of King Kong 
off their backs as they defeated 
UCSD 15-5 , 16-14, 15-11. 

The loss was a bitterly 
disappointing one for UCSD, not 
only because they had defeated 
laVerne in all their meetings this 
year, but also because of the 
fierce rivalry that has developed 
between the two clubs. One or 
both of the teams has been 
involved in the national 
championship final since 1981 , 
UCSD winning In 1981 and 
1984 while laVerne won the 
national title in 1982 "This is 
really disappointing," said UCSD 
blocker Monica Bradley. "They're 
our archrivals , and it really hurts 
to lose to them." 

Due to its success in the 
NCAA Tournament, the TritOn 
squad did not find its first-round 
elimination easy to cope with . 
"this is the first time we had ever 
lost in the NCAA Tournament 
except for the fi nals, so we 
needed to have a meeting after 
the match JUSt so we could talk 
on how to deal with it," said 
UCSD coach Doug Dannevik. 
"You've got to give credit to 

laVerne, they played their best 
match of the year." 

In the estimation of coach jim 
Paschal, laVerne had to play its 
best game of the year to beat 
UCSD, and that's what 
happened. "I have the utmost 
respect for UC D," said Paschal. 
"They are a tremendous team, 
but we played great tonight. We 
made very few mistakes and we 
could have beat a lot of tcams 
tonight." 

One mistake made in the first 
game that proved to be pivotal 
wasn't .made by either team, but 
rather by the referee. laVerne 
blocker Karen Lotten bumped a 
high set on laVerne's third hit, 
but she hit it tOO hard and it 
looked like it might not cross the 
net, so blocker janet Jeffers gave 
it a little nudge over the net 
which should have been called 
as a four-hit Violation. The 
referees never blew the whistle , 
much to the disdain of the 
raucous Triton audience. 
laVerne subsequently won the 
point and seemed to take off 
from there as laVerne hitter 
Shauna Hinrichs poured It on 
sconng four of the Leopards' last 
five points in the game for a IS-
S decision. 

The second game was the 
kind that gave bOth coaches gray 
hairs. One point was highlighted 
by a marvelous dig by laVerne's 
Veromca Ortlieb , but Monica 
Bradley slammed a blistering 
shot down the right side to give 
UCSD a 5-2 lead. laVerne had 
taken a 13- \0 lead late in the 

SwiInDlerS set to 
better '84-85 season 
By ERICA GLENNON, Stal! Wnter 

I 1'S TOUGH FOR UCSD swimming coach Bill Morgan to understand how some 
students can sleep in until 12 In 
the afternoon. 'They only see 
four hours of sunhght!" he exlaims. 
Morgan makes sure that his 
swimmers enjoy a full day of 
sunlight. Workouts start at 6:30 
am daily, and for the twO and a 
half hours that they are in the 
water, .the team gets an enduring, 
mostly aerobic workout . Morgan 
doesn't feel that it's a tough 
lifestyle to maintain . "Your 
fathers have been doing it for 
years to go to work; besides," 
comments Bill, "most of the 
swimmers prefer morning 
workouts." 

Well, whether or not they do 
enjoy taking an early rnorning 
dip, they do it. And they are 
required to show up for six 
workouts a week. Maybe It'S this 
type of dedicanon that makes 
Bill Morgan feel his swimmers 
show "tremendous commitment" 
to me program. Or m;o ybe there 
is more ... 

Maybe the fact that the team 
must give up two weeks of their 
winter vacation has something to 
do with it. The team mUSt take 
part in what Morgan calls 

Opportunity Week workouts." 
The team calls It Hell Week. The 
first Opportunity Week starts 
immediately after finals (Dec. 15-
19). The second Opportunity 
Week starts soon after Christmas 
(Dec 29-jan. 4). 

The team is also responsible 
for raising close to $20,000 for 
traveling expenses , since they 
will be traveling farther than any 
other Div. III swimming school 
in the natlon . The intercollegiate 
athletic program has been helpful 
in increaSing coaching salaries 
and funds for the sport, but, 
nevertheless, more money is 
needed. This year the team will 
travel as far as Ohio and Idaho. 

But even with all the 
dedication involved , Bill Morgan 
wams his sWimmers to have an 
Identity outside the team. "It's 
easy to allow the team to become 
your total idennty ," says Btll, 
"and as a coach, I don't belIeve 
that that is health y." In order to 
work on nme management, self-
image, individual relaxanon and 
attention cutnrol, the team works 
With sports psychologist, Sharon 
Colgan . Bill wams hi s team to 
have a SOCial !tfe and take pall 
m campus ac[iv[lIes. Time 
management can be a prohlem 
and Sharon help the team 

game when UCSD mounted a 
comeback. Triton blocker Mary 
Pontius dented wood on a 
feathery set from Christy Wada , 
the Pontius found an open area 
in the middle. Heidi Maier 
spotted the inside of the left side 
for one score, and on the next 
two plays, laVerne hit the baH 
into the net and OUt of bounds 
to give UCSD the serve for the 
game at 14-13. But uVeme held 
its ground , saving four game 
points to win 16-14. 

In the third game UCSD tried 
to fight back from a 89-5 deficit 
to tie the score at 9-9. The 
Tritons' passing broke down , 
though , and they found 
themselves down 13-10. Bradley's 
booming ace showed signs mat 
maybe UCSD would be able to 
come from behind. But Bradley, 
going for another ace, hit the 
net, and laVerne went on to win 
the game and match. 

Although his team lost, 
Dannevik had no regrets about 
the match. "We played good and 
we shouldn't feel badly about the 
way we played. The bottom line, 
though, was that me team who 
played better tonight won, but I 
think our girls played great We 
were nervous and light in the 
first game, but we were still able 
to fight back. This was supposed 
to be a rebuilding year, but I still 
think we were capable of making 
it to the final four just as we 
were capable of losing in the first 
round." 

laVerne coach Parchal agrees. 
·We could have lost mis game 
also , but we JUSt won at the right 
time" IZ:l 

prioritize and relax. 
Last year, both the men's and 
women 's teams finished third in 
the Nationals at the division III 
level, and with their biggest and 
most talented team ever 
assembled this year, Morgan 
predicts they will be just as 
tough . 

The 1986 men's team has 
three national champions 
returning for them. Bill 
Kazmierowicz won the 100 yard 
backstroke title , Roger Brisbane 
is the 200 yard butterny champ, 
and Jeff Sabme won In one and 
three meter diving. The freshman 
recruits include two All-American 
high school swimmers, Jim 
Cavataio and Derron Frederick, 
and many other returning 
swimmers placed high in last 
year's National meet also. 

The women's (eam also 
includes twO national swimmers, 
Irene Mons who is the 500 yard 
freestyle camp, and Alison 
Gilmore who won the 100 yard 
butterny title. Tracy Mulvany and 
Laura Knochenhauer are also 
national swimmers. 

The key to the Triton's success 
seems to be dedication , not only 
on the part of the swimmers, but 
on the pan of the staff as well. 
The team is dedicated to putting 
quite a bit of themselves tnto 
their sport beyond JUSt working 
out And the coachtng staff 
strl ves to help the swimmers 
develop themselves and their 
goals for the season. So even If 
all of thi s means giving up late 
ntghts 10 order to attend early 
m rntng workouts, there seems 
to be plenty 01 sunshtne in the 
cnd . ~ 

La Veme players celebrate aJter avengingJour season losses to UCSD.

Nl R); To WI R~II ~I Fencers # 1 after 
UCLA, CSULB wins Hall of Fame-Believe it or not, little 01' UCSD has its own Hall of Fame, and duringAlumnt Weekend the first four ex-Tritons were enshrined in ceremonies between the basketball games. Selected for their outstanding feats at UCSD and beyond were: Mark Allen , [he AlA All -American 

swimmer from 1977-1980. Whtle swimming at UCSD, Allen held the school records for the 200-yard 
indiVidual medley, 400-yard individual medley, lOO-yard backstroke and 200-yard backstroke. Allen 
has gone on to distinguish himself as a world class triathlete. 

Kerry Klostern:tan was the ftrst UC D All -American while leading the 1970 men's volleyball team to 
UCSD's first National Championship. He was named the MVP in the 1970 NAlA natlonal tourney and 
was named to the NAIA District III Ali-District team. Klosterman went on to become a member of the 1976 
Canadian OlympiC team and is currently the director of the National TrainingCenter for USA Volleyball. 
Cheryl Landay White played for both the women's badminton and field hockey teams. In 1974 Chetyl 
was ranked seventh in the US badminton singles. After graduation, White has won four US National 
Si ngles Badminton Championship titles in 1978, 1980,1982 and 1984. 

Paul Trainer was probably the best basketball player UCSD has ever seen. A National Association of 
Basketball Coaches All-American and an NAJA District 1Il All-District player, Trainer holds more 
basketball records than any other UCSD basketball player. During his four-year reign, Trainer amassed 
1930 career points and led the team in scoring and rebounding all four years. Trainer holds the follOWing 
school records: career points per game, 1-8.6; career rebounds, 1094; most rebounds per season, 315; 
career rebounds per game, 10.5; free throws in a season, 147; career free throws, 432; most field goals 
scored m a :;i ngle game, 15 (three times). Trainer is currently playing in Europe. 
Bowl us over-The holidays are always teeming wim activities. Turkeys and cookies are a-bakin', 
shopping malls are a-buzzin', Christmas carolers are a-carolin', but most important of all , footballs are a-
flyin' from the direction of your television set. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's that time of 
year when TV sets natlonwide are taken hostage and choked with a glut of football games, led by the 
avalanche of college bowl games which seem to pop up like a bad case of acne. 

Tis the season for giving, but one thing's for sure, we get too much meaningless football bowl games. 
One can marvel at the veritable pot pouni that can satisfy everyone's pigskin palate: 

-In the mood for fruit salad? The Peach, Cherry, Citrus, and Orange are tasty bowl choices. 
-Not many people know that when Patrick Henry said, "Give me liberty or give me death ," he said It 

as an excuse to fo rm the Uberty Bowl. Our founding fathers jumped on the bandwagon and inspired the 
illustrlous Independence , Freedom and All -American Bowls . 

-Are you manic-depress[ve? Then the twO places to avoid are the top ofTioga Hall and the Blue-Gray 
Bowl. 

-And for you margarine lovers, there's, of course , the Bluebonnet Bowl. 
After watching all these bowl games, many college football fans remain in the lurch as to who is 

Number One. Come New Year's Dar' Penn State players may be in a frenzy, all pOinting their index 
fingers in the sky in the Orange Bow . But in Pasadena, the Iowa Hawkeyes may be doing the same thing. 

The scenario takes place in virtually aU the bowl games and fans across the country lie in a whirl of 
confusion and discontent as the decision of who's the best college football team in the nation is judged 
subjectively=-much like a beauty contest. This dinosaur method of deciding the national championship 
should give way to a tournament similar to the one college basketball uses. This way, there are no 
complaints as to who is Number One. But as long as Orange, Rose , Sugar, and Cotton means major league 
Green-one will still be able to go to the Pioneer Bowl to see a Number One team.

A JUBILANT men's fencing team returned from LA recently having defeated 
their strongest challengers, UCLA 
and CSULB, to establish 
themselves in first ' place for the 
first half of the Southern 
California Conference season. 
Both matches were cliff-hangers 
down to the last bouts, making 
every touch in every bout crucial. 

First year compeutors William 
Comenat and Tim Ash (in sabre) 
and john Keller (in epee) carried 
thei r weight well and made 
important victories to add to the 
overall results. Against CSULB, 
senior Chris Dorger won the 
decisive bout for the epee team 
by a one-touch margtn , while 
foilist Farshad Ahadian won the 
last bout in spite of a hand 
inJUry. Likewise , foil team 
captam Kevin Mills and Mark 
Erickson both fenced crucial 

bouts to win by one-touch 
margins. 

The rookie women's team also 
bauled the toughest women's 
team in me conference and lost 
1-15 against UCLA and 3-13 
against CSULB. 

Coach Lynne Antorrelli made 
the comment that "the men's 
teams have a fair balance of 
experience and inexperienced 
fencers. However, the women's 
team is made up of beginners in 
three of the four members. Also , 
team captain Leslie Rltcher has 
only one year experience. I am 
very proud of the spirit and fight 
these women display tn spite of 
the current odds. All of them are 
developing and improving under 
competitive circumstances, and it 
is only a matter of time before 
they are a proficient as the: 
opposition." IZ:l
