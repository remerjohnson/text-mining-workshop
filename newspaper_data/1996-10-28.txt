By Terry Lew

Robert Dynes, a physicist by training and a 
university administrator by experience, was in-
tilled Friday as UCSD's sixth chancellor in a 

ceremony marked by both pomp and circum-
stance. 

UC Office of the President (UCOP) spokes-

man Mike Lassiter said the ceremony, which 
drew a 1,200-person capacity crowd to the 
RIMAC Arena, co ' t $47,()()() and was paid for 
entirely by UCOP and the UC regent . 

Regent Tirso Del Junco, who pre ided over 
the ceremony and was one of nine people from 
the university community to give oflicial greet-
ings to Dynes, said Dyne and UCSD are a good 
combination. 

"The chancellor and the campus are well-
matched for each other," Del Junco said. "80th

By Mary Hlllins 
Associate News Editor 

As ociation of Student EmployeeslUnited 
Auto Workers (ASElUA W)union member may 
go on strike as early as next week if UCSD 
Chancellor Rohert Dynes refuses to grant them 
official recognition by today' . deadline. 

"We need to do something that sends a mes-
sag to the administration," A ElUA W trike 
Organizer Joel 8eeson said. 

The union, which represents \any - but not 
all - academic student employee at UCSD, 
voted last May to strike this fall quarter. 

Although union members claim they will 
ca ll off the strike if the administration grant!> 
them CO llective-bargaining rights. Dynes says 
he won't back down. 

Dynessaid unday night he would keep lines 
of communication open with the ASEIUA W, 
hut he maintai ned that he and the other eight U 
chancellors - as well a UC President Richard 
Atkinson - would not recognize the union. 

"I hope they don' t go on strike," Dynes said. 
"It's not in their best interests or in the interest 
of the campus. 1 would rather sit down and talk 
with them." . 

Although the ASEIUA W struggle for recog-
nition dates back at least four years, the recent 
stand-off started eptembcr 27 when the union 
delivered a letter to Dynes threatening to strike

Scattered showersdarkcned the

was shining in time for SigmaNu's 
first annual Sandblast Day at La 
Jolla Shores on Saturday. 

The funds raised at the event 
were donated to the Boys and Girls 
Club of Clairemont - an after-
school camp for 
children. 

Each sorority was matched with 
three chi Idren forthe various events. 
The games included a water-bal-
loon toss, three-legged race, i mple 
obstacle course, and a pumpkin-
carving competition. 

The pumpkin-carving contes-
tants had the additional challenge 
of incorporating the emblems of 
Sigma Nu, The Boys and GirlsClub, 

and the sororities 
into the carving. 

The Sandblasl

UCSD Security Expert Receives 
Prestigious Packard Fellowship 

Mihir Bellare, assistant professor of computer sci· 
ence and engineering, is one of 20 university research· 
ers awarded the David and Luci le Packard Foundation 
Fellowship for Science and Engineering. 

The 1996 fellows were nominated by their univer-
sity presidents and recommended by a committee of 
nationally recognized scientists. Bellare will receive 
$500,000 over a five year period to support his 
research . 

The award is the largest non-governmental program 
of unrestricted grants to young university faculty, cover· 
ing the entire spectrum of science and engineering. 

Bellare came to UCSD in 1995 from the IBM T.J . 
Watson Research Center, where he and his colleague 
Phillip Rogaway invented a concept called practice 
oriented provable security. 

Bellare's work is considered to be a major step in 
moving network security from an ad hoc application to 
an engineering discipline,

4 OPINION The UCSD Guardian M9.nday. October 28. 1996 

PINION 

Proposition 212 Directly Violates 
First Amendment Rights 
., ........... 
Opinion Editor 

The question of whether 
wealthy individuals or special-
interest groups (or any elite group, 
for that mailer) exert undue influ-
ence on politicians and the politi-
cal process is an imponant one. 
We expect elected officials to 
serve the public trust by drafting, 
interpreting and enforcing laws 
that promote the public good 
rather than the interests of a select 
few. Moreover, we expect politi-
cians 1101 to abuse their offices for 
personal gain - especially finan-
cial gain. 

Given these eJtpectations, it is 
very easy to see why many people 
are ,-'oncemed about the issue of 
campaign-finance reform. 
Because of the immense cost of # 
wasing an effective political cam-
paign, candidates are forced to 
solicit contributions from the 
people who are most able to 
donate generously - wealthy 
individuals and corporations. 

The connict of interest arises 
when these wealthy individuals 

find themselves in a position 
where they need to cajole an 
elecled official inlo supporting (or 
opposing) legislation that might 
significantly affectlheir wealth. 

It is not wrong for us to want 
politicians to do the right thing, 
regardless of the consequences for 
their potential personal gain. But 
we have to remember that the rea-
son the issue of money in politics 
has become so contentious is tbe-
cause government has the power 
to regulate such a large number of 
spheres of human activity - and 
most imponantly commercial 
, .. 

actIVIty. 
Ours is the age when govern-

ment regulates everything from 
cable 1V programming and rates, 
to telephones; from the develop-
ment of new housing units, to 
contracting for public entities 
such as public schools. The gov-
ernment meddles in just about 
every human endeavor. 

It is not surprising, then, that 
wealthy individuals and corpora-
tions see contributions to political 
candidates IS "investments" 

which have the potential for prof-
it.lt is also not surprising that cor-
porations lobby government to 
gain advantqes for their busi-
ness. This is to be expected. 

However, you might reply that 
just because people are likely 10 
do this doesn't make it right. We 
can't just say, "Boys will be 
boys," and then not try to do 
something about bad behavior. 

Let me offer a provocative the-
sis: It is not immoral for corpora-
tions or individuals to seek to 
influence the political process -
especially when pending legisla-
tion will have a dramatic impact 
on their livelihood. 

Would we seek to limit cam-
paign contributions by Planned 
Parenthood on the theoc:y that they 
are a corrupting influence on mar-
ginally pro-choice legislators? I 
think we all would agree that 
Planned Parenthood and the pe0-
ple it represents have an enor-
mous stake in the potential regula-
tion of abortion. Certainly it 
would be wrong to limit their

Contributing Opinion ~ter 

My friends wi II tell you thaI )' m 
usually a pretty easy-going person. I 
let a lot of things slide. There are real-
ly only two things that I insist on in 
my relations with others: honesty and 
communication. 

That's why I've always had such a 
probl~m with politics. The level of 
deception, corruption and disregard 
for what ordinary people really want 
sickens me. When it comes to politics, 
my voice really doesn't seem to mal-
ter. Yet it doesn't seem hard for Bill 
Gates to make his voice heard. The 
voices of oil companies also seem to 
be heard, as do the voices of those 
nameless people who want to see stu-
dent fees go up. 

What politics comes down to is 
money, and that makes me angry. I 
am fed up with corporations and the 
super-rich buying off our politicians. 
Sure. bribes are illegal, but 
California's political candidates can 
accept basically as much money IS

in order to fund their ~ampaigns. 

Make no mistake about il : 
Fundraising is crucial to winning an 
election. In the last election, candi-
dates who raised more money than 

.. their opponents won 96 percent of the 
time. Candidates know from the 
beginning that in order to succeed in 
politics they must have views that are 
suppmed by those with money. In 
order to obtain such support. they tai-
lor their campaign promises (whether 
public or private) to fit what major 
corporations and the wealthy want to 
hear. 

Who loses in this? The people do. 
After all. why should our politicians 
bother to glliq the favor of the average 
citizen"? They don't have lime for that 
- they're too busy making phone 
calls to Philip Morris or Shell Oil for 
funding. 

The most amazing thing is that 80 
percent of the time. the contributions 
California politicians receive do not

None of this i to say that a

by increasing our own awareness of

Can we count on Ihese people to

Not under the current laws. 
There are no limitations on where 
candidates can get funding, or from 
whom. We all know from experi-
ence that we cannot trust our offi-
cials to regulale themselves. espe-
cially when big-moneyed interests 
arc breathing down their necks.

things will never change. 

That's why Proposition 212 is 
such an Imponant measure. The 
proposition is the toughest cam-

ing how much they can contribute LO 
political campaigns. Individuals 
would be allowed to make only 
$100 conLributions to campaigns for 
non-statewide offices and $200 to 
statewide campaigns. Corporalion~ 
(i ncluding non-profits and unions) 
would be altogether banned from 
making campaign contributions. 

Proposition 212 also scch to 
impose mandatory pending limits 
on political candidates depending 
on the office for which they are run -
ning. 

The problem wilh the~e limita-
Lions is that Lhey all run afoul of the 
Constitution. The Constitution pro-
vides that "Congre . hall make no 
law ... abridging freedom of speech. 
or of the press, or the right of the 
people peaceably to assemble." In 
other words. the govemment cannot

proposed in the United States. It 
prevents corporations from being 
able 10 contribute money 10 polili-
cians' campaigns, sets limits on how 
much an individual can give to a 
campaign ($ 100 for district offices. 
$200 for statewide) and requires that 
politicians get 75 percent or more of 
their money from the district they 
wish to represenl. 

What will this do for politics'! It 
will force politicians to start owning 
up to all of us, not just a select lew. 
They will need to spend their time 
gelling the favor of large numbers of 
their own constituents. If politician 
can only accept contributions of 
$100 or less. my $40 or your $25 
suddenly means something 10 them. 

Proposition 212 will also release 
politicians from the chains Ihat bind

checks coming in from corpora-
tions, politicians will not feel oblig-
ated to cave in to pressures from 
these businesses. They will feel 
freer 10 do what we want them to do: 
pass legislalion that benefits us all. 

Finally, Proposition 212 will 
make local politics what it was 
meant to be: local. Those candidates 

People have a right to buy all the 
advertisement they can alford. 

Propo ition 212 arbitrarily limits 
the right of political candidates, 
their campaigns and many other 
organizations to freely expresnhcir 
views. Conlribulions to polilical 
campaigns are a form of political 
participation - political advocacy 
- Ihat Is~rotected by the First 
Amendment's free-speech clause. 

The bollom line is that bolh Ihe 
mandatory spending limits, and the 
individual and corporate contribu-
tion limits are likely to be thrown 
out in court. If passcd. Proposi tion 
212 will have no real impact. 

Moreover, Proposi tion 212 pro-
vides for the unlimited giving of 
gifts and cash payments (such as 
speak.ing honoraria) to political can-
didate . Under Proposition 212 any-

who generate a great deal of local 
support will be protected from being 
squashed by less popular opponents 
who are heavily funded by special 
interests. 

Proposition 212 is a grassroots 
initiative. It is supported by a wide 
range of people that often have 
nothing in common except that they 
are sick of the polilical process. 
There's no hidden agenda, there's 
no corporate funding, and be t of 
all, it's a non-partisan issue. 

There are only two major argu-
ments against 212. It supposedly 
allows lobbyists to give gifts to 
politicians. Some also argue that 
parts of Proposilion 212 are uncon-
stitutional. and so the entire thing 
will be thrown out in coun. 

The first argumenl is an out-and-
out lie: Under Proposition 212, lob-

one and any group could "pay" a 
political -candidate exomitant sums 
of money for a speaking engage-
ment, or make "gifts .. of travel or 
olher goods. 

Basically, people and group 
could contribute any amount of cash 
to a candidate, just not to hi s cam-
paign. This loophole would exacer-
bate the problem of large campaign 
w ntributions while imuhancou Iy 
making them virtually untraceable. 
While proponents of 2 12 rightly 
reply that anti -bribery laws would 
remain in effect, large campaign 
contributions would persist under 
Proposition 212. 

Propo ilion 212 is fraudulent , 
blatantly unconstitutional and tailor-
made for liberal special intcre ts. 
All of us should vote no on thi.s 
monstrosity. 

byists are not allowed to give gifts 
of any kind to a candidate for office. 
The second argument is simply 
absurd. While it is true thai manda-
tory spending limits have been ruled 
unconstitutional in the past, these 
provisions are severable. If a court 
decides that these limits are uncon-
stitutional. voluntary spending lim-
its immediately go into effect. 

Let's foree our politicians out of 
Iheir oftices, away from the phones, 
and into the public. Let's foree them 
to rely on the contributions of ordi-
nary people. Isn't that what democ-
racy is supposedly all about, any-
way? When there comes a time that 
our contributions make a difference. 
we will all be more likely to care 
about the resu Its of our local elec-
tions, and the results of the elections 
will more often reflect our interests.

DYNES: New 
chancellor displays 
sense of humor 
Continued from ..... 1 
examples of the very best the UC 
has LO offer the people of the state 
and the nation at large." 

UC President Richard Atkinson, 
who served as UCSD's fifth chan-
cellor from 1980 to 1995, agreed 
that Dynes would make an e)(cel -
lent chancellor and noted that 
Dynes hasn ' t grown tired of the 
job yet. 

"He is thoroughly familiar with 
the problems. challengcs, hopes. 
dreams and aspirations of the San 
Diego campus and the greater San 
Diego community ," Atkinson said. 
"His presence here today is an en-
couraging indication that, si)( months 
into his administration, he still feels 
the pleasures of orlice outweigh the 
pitfall ." 

UCSD Foundation Monroe Trout 
and Academic Senate Div ision Chair 
Georg ibs Anagnostopoulos, who 
also gave official greetings to the 
new chancellor. praised both Dynes 
and his work . 

"His open sLyle but deliberate 

and prompt decision-making will 
serve him well in the most difficult 
CEO job in San Diego county," 
Trout said. 

"Today 's inauguration is a truly 
special one - the inauguration of 
the chancellor who will lead the 
university inLothe next millennium," 
Anay,oostopoulos added. 

San Diego Mayor Susan Golding, 
who delivered the keynote address, 
commended Dynes as "a man of 
remarkable wisdom." 

"He has a vision we can all relate 
to," former Interim Chancellor 
Marjorie Caserio said. 

Caserio, former chancellors Wil-
liam McGill and William McElroy, 
and former UC Provost Walter 
Massey - who left to become presi-
dent of Morehouse College - all 
attended the inauguration. 

One of the ceremony 's many 
unscripted moments of levity came 
when Atkinson allempted to place 
the ceremonial Chancellor's Medal 
over Dynes' head - but the ribbon, 
resembling nothing so much as a 
Gordian knot, had other plans. 

Atkin son gave the medal to 
Dynes to untangle, noting that Dynes' 
was the "e)(perimental physicist" of 
the two.

than I did then. " 

- Robert Dynes 
UCSD Chancellor 

Dynes, a well-known joker in hi s 
own right. began his remarks with a 
story about a young boy named 
Bobby who didn ' t want to get out of 
bed in the morning. 

"He said , 'Li sten, I'll give you 
two reasons why I don ' t want to go 
to school. First, I' m not really get-
ting anything done at school. Sec-
ond. the teachers don' t like me.' 

"And Bobby 's mom said , 
'You' ve got to go to school, and I'll 
give you two reasons why: Nu'mber 
one, you' re 53 years old, and num-
ber two, you' re the chancellor.'" 

After the laughter died down, 

Dynes addressed more serious is-
sues. 

"UCSD is one of the great uni-
versities in the country, even though 
it 's only 36 years old," Dynes said: 
"When we're in the 21st century, 
we' ll show them what a public uni -
versity can do." 

Dynes came to UCSD in 1991 as 
a physics professor afler a 22-year 
career as a research scientisl at 
AT&T Bell Laboratories. Hequickly 
became chair of the physics depart-
ment, and was appointed senior vice 
chancellor of academic affairs last 
year. 

"I chose this campus because I 
was convinced UCSD and San Di-
ego were a uni versity and commu-
nity oflhe future," he said. ". haven' t 
looked back, and I believe it now 
more than 'l did then." 

According to Dynes, UCSD 
draws its strength from two basic 
groups-siudents, faculty and staff. 
and the San Diego community it-
sell'. 

Dynes addressed each group, 
pledging LO be responsive to stu -
dent s' concern s and thankin g 
UCSD's 13,057 staff members fo r 
keeping the uni versity in motion.

thoughtful work of the staff," he 
said . 

Dynes also commended the fac-
ulty for its scholarship and "com-
mitment 10 quality leaching," and 
thanked the San Diego community 
for continuing to support the uni-
versity. 

Dynes, who called the San Diego 
region an "awakening giant," said 
the university must aggressively 
seek partnerships with local indus-
try. 

". am committed to being an ac-
tive catalyst in thi s evolution," he 
said. 

Dynes also addressed some of 
the problems facing the university, 
including diversity and the so-called 
"Tidal Wave 1I" - the projecLed 
ri se in e nrollment as the baby 
boomers' children head off to col-
lege. 

"We must find ways to serve the 
whole population of the state," he 
said. 

A public reception on the RIMAC 
patio followed the inauguration, as 
wrll as a $6,000 private reception in 
the Faculty Club for approximately 
200 administrators and university 
supponers.

STRIKE: GSA 
is determined to 
remain neutral 
Continued from pac. 1 
wood said they were unprepared to 
recognize the union. 

Dynes sa id the chancellors all 
met with Atkinson to di scuss the 
Issue. 

"We decided [we would] write 
leiters to all of [the unions on the 
vari ous campuses] descri bi ng how 
lwe i fe lt." Dynes said. "This leller 
was Ito be l two-fold." 

Dynes said he persona II y drafted 
such a leller. in which he wrote that 
"a union was not an appropriate 
organizat ion fo r students on cam-
pus." 

Dynes said he also wrole in the 
leller that if the student employees 
had problems, they should feel free 
to apprOach him with them. 

UCSD Inte ri m Senior Vice Chan-
cellor for Academic Affairs Rich-

ardAlliyeh said he was aware Dynes 
had drafted a leller, but neither Dynes 
nor Auiyeh were cenain whether 
the letter had been sent. 

Beeson said Sunday he had not 
recei ved the leller, and that if Dynes 
did nOI meet today 's deadline,union 
members would meet Wednesday 
at 5 p.m. to discuss and vote on the 
details of the strike. 

Beeson said yesterday that whi Ie 
he wa unable to comment on the 
details of the ASElUA W strikestrat-
egy, Wednesday 's vote would de-
termine the duration as well as the 
form of the strike. 

According to a un ion newsletter 
di stributed by Beeson, "disruptive 
actions, including strikes. have been 
planned at six UC campuses for thi s 
Fall." 

The vote i scheduled, barring 
the administration's sudden rever-
sa l of its position, to take placeat the 
Porter's Pub Meeti ng Room from 6 
p.m. to 9 p.m. It will continue on 
Thursday from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.

Although some UCSD adminis-
trators say Dynes has made an effon 
to address the union's issues. such 
as attending a recent UCSD Gradu-
ate Student Association meeting, 
members say they are still dissatis-
fied . 

According to a memo issued by 
Beeson, Dynes aid he recei ved the 
letl er but his o ffice has not yet of-
fered an officia l reply. 

Beeson said Dynes told students 
at a GS A meeling several weeks ago 
that he believed ·tudent workers are 
nOt employees of the uni versity, but 
essent ially "work for themselves" 
and therefore dQ nO! have a right to 
collective bargaining. 

UCSD Assi tant Vice Chancel-
lorf r University Relations Winifred 
Cox sa id that Dynes was "very con-
cerned and commitled to the quality 
of Ii fe for graduate students." 

GSA President Vicki Mayersa id 
she invi ted Dynes tospeak <11 a pub-
lic GSA mecting several wceks ago 
to "talk about whatever pcople 

NEWS 9 

wanted to talk aboul." 
Mayer said Dynes showed up for 

the meeting, as well as several ASEI 
UA W members who questioned 
Dynes on his views at the lime. 

"I invited him and notcoinc iden-
tally, some ASE members saw that 
he was on the age nda and got on the 
speakers' li st," Mayer said. " It was 
one of the first questi ons they 
brought up ... they asked 'Would you 
recognize us'!' He said no." 

However. Mayer said the GSA 
voted last year that il would remain 
neutral in regards to the strike, pri. 
mari Iy because of the fac tioning of 
pro-union and anti -union members 
within the GSA. 

"Some members of the GSA are 
also members of the un ion, while 
some GSA members are very anti -
union." she aid. "S ince the GSA is 
a student government that is funded 
by mandatory student fees. asa body 
we have no right to act [agai nsl

Mayer also cited the equal split 
among teaching assist.,nts and re-
search assistants in the GSA. as 
opposed to the primarily teaching-
assistant union. as a reason for the 
GSA 's neutrality . 

"Look at the composition of the 
union ... it's mostlyTAs. not RAs," 
she said. "Because the composi-
tion of the union is skewed. the 
GSA doesn ' t want to cause a com-
motion by taki ng a position." 

However. Mayer sa id so me 
GSA members are also members 
of ASEIUA W. and may decide to 
strike as individuals. 

The vote to strike came nine 
months after a Seprember 15 ru Ii ng 
by Ca lifornia Public Employment 
Relati ons Board Admini trative 

Law Judge James Tamm that 
UCLA graduate-student instructors 
had the right to collective bargain-
ing. 

The university is currently ap· 
pealing the ruling. 

"We're in the midst of a legal 
process," Atliyeh said. "We're fol -
lowing the procedures that are 
spelled out by the law ... the idea of 
a walkout in the middle of the well · 
defined process doesn't make that 
much sense." 

However, Beeson argued the 
"process" was tied up in thecouns 
and that it could take years to 
resolve. He also said most gradu. 
ate students feared that in a few 
years they would ha ve graduated, 
yet rhe matter would still be unre-
solved. 

Attiyeh used this to challenge 
the rightofstudents to form a uni on. 

"If they're go ing to be leavi ng

that."

Personal fitness trainer offers health tips, 
fitness advice for the sedentary student 

By Chris Schreiber 
Senior Slaff Writer 

UCSD students often get 
caught up in the hustle and 
bustle of daily re ponsibilities 
such as trying to keep up with 
rudies and maintaining a social 

life. Personal health often gets 
lost in this shuffle. 

The Guardian interviewed 
Jenny Thompson, a personal 
trainer at the 24-Hour Fitness 
Center in UTC, to find out more 
about what students can do to 
keep up their health. Thompson 
is a 23-year-old student at San 
Diego State University 
majoring in sports nutrition. 
Guardian: What exactly Is 
"good shape"? 

Thompson: What I usually 
ask a client is, "How do you feel 
in your clothes?" "What does 
the mirror say?" I don't believe 
in a single delinition - there 
are many factors, such as 
cardiovascular fitness, proper 
nutrition, etc. 

A good rule of thumb is if 
you can do cardiovascular 
exercise and still carry on a 
conversation, you're in decent 

shape. If doing things like re-
arranging your furniture doesn't 
cause you to become 
completely exhausted, you're 
probably in decent shape. Good 
shape takes a bit more effort. 
What Is the Ideal body-fat 
percent composition? 

For men, the optimal range is 
between 8-15 percent body f al. 
For women it's slightly higher, 
due in part to lower resting 
metabolisms. For women it's 
about 15-22 percent. 
Describe a Jood procram 
for someone try"I' to get 
back Into shape. 

First, the person should 
begin a moderate cardiovascular 
workout, exercising four or five 

I . times a week. You don't even 
have to go into the gym. We live 
in one of the most beautiful 
cities in the country. Get out and 
rollerblade or power-walk and 
enjoy the outdoors. 

Resistance training is also 
important to increase lean 
muscle mass. You should do 
resistance training four or five 
times a week, focusing on the 
major muscle groups such as the 

back , che t, and legs. Your 
muscles adapt quickly to a 
workout program, and it 's 
important to get a consistent, 
full body program. 
Many students wake up 
early and study late. How 
Important Is proper rest to 
a good exercise routine? 

Rest is everything. Your 
body needs time to heal itself, 
and your mind needs rest so it 
can focus during your workouts . 
If you keep your body 
constantly running, you'll bum 
it oul. 

I am a firm believer in 
setting small, realistic goals 
such as gelling your exercise in 
each day. You have a lot more 
motivation to work out when 
you've gotten your resl. Your 
body goes through so much 
when you work out that rest 
really is the key. 
What sort of food should a 
person eat? 

Almost everyone can begin 
by CUlling the fat in their diets. 
You need to pay attention to 
overall caloric intake, and

World-class RIMAe facilities give UCSD 
students a wide variety Of fitness options 

By John Murphy 
Senior Staff Writer 

Faced with UCSD's 
competitive academic 
environment , many students 
lind it difficult to find the time 
to exercise. For the student who 
lives on campus, traveling to a 
health club off campus seems 
like an unlikely proposition. 
Luckily, a world-class facilitY 'is 
located on campus that feature ' 
an array of machines, trainers 
and programs to get the student 
body into shape. 

The Recreation. Intramural 
and Athletic Complex, more 
commonly known as RIMAe. 
offers UCSD students a variety 
of paths to physical well-being. 
Perched atop a ·hi II overlooking 
the North Campus Recreational 
Fields. RIMAC is test~ment to 
what $32 million and the 
determination to consolidate 
most of the campus' athlellcs 
facilities under one roof can 
ace mplish. The nearly 200,000 
square fOOl facility was opened 
in January 1995 to serve as 

UCSD's main recreational and 
athletic facility. 

Whether you are intere ted 
in weight training, aerobic or 
just playing a quick game of 
basketball with a group of 
friends, RIMAC offers the 
facilities and the eq uipment. 
Housed at the complex are a 
weight room, three activity 
roo m , an auxi li ary gym and an 
arena that can hold live full 
basketba ll courts. 

"It 's definitely a mixed-use 
faci lity," ~aid Director of Spons 
Facilities Don Chadwick. "It i 
not designated for one 
department only, but for the 
whole campus." 

POSSibly the most popular 
destination at the RIMAC 
complex for the health-
consciou , the 12,000 square 
foot weight room features an 
assortment of weIght and 
resi tance machines, six sets of 
free weights and a variety of 
cardiovascular equipment such 
a exercise bikes. Be ides being 
one of the largest such facilities 

on the We I Coast, the weight 
room has a unique design that 
allows concurrent use by the 
general public and recreation 
classes or tea ms. 

"The design of it was to 
allow for special use by teams, 
clubs or classes, but never close 
it up to the general public. We 
created that by having that pit in 
the center," aid Chadwick. 
"The pit is reservable by teams, 
but whenever it's being used, the 
rest of the room is sti II open to 
the public." 

Those interested in using the 
weight room must first 
complete a 15-minute 
orientation. 

RIMAC also offers aerobics, 
dance and martial-arts classcs in 
the facility's three activity 
rooms. With a mirror, ballct bars 
and a built -in sound system, 
Activity Room One was 
specifically designed for 
exercise and dance. Activity 
Room Two, the largest of the 
multi -purpose activity room , I

cutting fat is a good way to do 
that. I recommend going to the 
grocery store and stocking the 
fridge with good food ' and 
skipping that high fat cafeteria 
fare altogether. 

You should know your own 
body and be able 10 feel your 
nutritional needs. When you make 
changes in your diet, and you feel 
better and have more energy, 
you'll know you ' re doing 
something right. 

As for general guidelines, 
stock up on complex 
carbohydrates like breads, cereals, 
and pastas. Cut down on the red 
meat, but, women especially, 
make sure that you're gelling your 
iron from either supplements or 
green, leafy vegetables. Caloric 
intake is the most important thing. 
As your Professor [paull Salt man 
[of the biology department] says, 
"If you eat it, and you don't burn 
it, you sit on it." 
What are some simple 
"do's" and "don'ts" of 
proper exercise? 

Everyone needs to slow it 
down, and stay in control. Control 
the weight, rather than let it 
control you . Proper form IS

crucial. You should do your 
research a~ ask someone who 
knows what the proper form is on 
each machine and for each 
exercise you do. 

Another important thing is 
breathing. You need to exhale on 
Ihe exertion in weightlifting, and 
breath normally during cardio. It 's 
natural for people to hold their 
breath while exerting, but your 
muscles need that oxygen . 
What Is Important for 
effective weight lo.s? 

Proper exercise, proper 
nutrition, and consistent workouts. 
You will need to keep up with all 
of these to build an effective 
program. [f you neglect one of 
those area, you' ll cheat yourself 
and won't achieve your goals. 

If you cut your calories too 

The UCSD Guardian 

drastically or don't gel lhe proper 
nutrients, your body wi II think 
thai it is slarving and slow down 
your metabolism, maintaining ils 
precious fal reserves and burning 
muscle tissue. You'll have no 
energy and you won't lose weight. 

People also need 10 exercise 
correctly and consistently. People 
who go in erratically do not 
maximize their benefits, and get 
discouraged when they don't 
progress as fast as they had hoped. 
Your body needs to be conditioned. 
What about • program for 
effective weight pin? 

To gain weight, you up your 
caloric intake, but make sure to gel 
those calories from good ources. 
Increase your complex cams and 
proteins, focusing on lean meats. 
Don't go binging on Big-Macs if 
you don't want to gain fat. Also, 
try to keep up a constant caloric 
intake throughout the day, as 
opposed to three huge meals, 
which overwhelms the system. 

You should always get advice 
from a qualified person whcn 
beginning a program for either 
weight 10 s or weight gain. You 
can waste a lot of valuable timc 
and cnergy if you don ' t know 
exactly what you ' re doing. You 
can pos ess a lot of knowlcdge 
about litnes and technique, but 
it 's always good to get an 
objcctive opinion to make sure 
you're doing thing ri ght.

similarly equipped, while the third 
activity room - used primarily for 
martial -arts classes - fealUres 
padded walls and a suspended kick 
bag. All Ihree rooms have wooden 
spring tloors to prevent injury. 

The 44,000 square foot RIMAC 
arena - the crown jewel of the 
complex - is located in the eastern 
half of Ihe building and can 
accommodate a wide range of 
sports and seating configurations. 
The tloor of the arena is spring-
loaded with the Robbins Bio-
Cushion I to reduce injuries and 
provide a bounce to the step. 
Featuring telescopic bleachers, the 
arena can seat 4,000 for major 
events. When the bleachers are not 
in use, they can be retracted into 
thc walls, providing an expansive 
multi -use floor. 

"[The arena] contains five full -
sized basketball courts, which is 
unique among arenas," aid 
Chadwick. "Most arenas have a 
whole lot of scats and maybe one 
baskclball court in the center. We 
can retract all thc scats and have a 
huge open floor. which is 
wonderful for rec ~cational usc or 
intramural usc." 

Sharing a similar purpose to the 

FEATURES 13 

arena is the Iwo-coun Auxiliary 
Gym, which is used primarily for 
basketball, volleyball, tloor hockey 
and indoor soccer. Unlike the main 
arena, the gym fealUres rounded 
corners for indoor soccer and 
hockey. A cunain can also be 
lowered from the ceiling 10 
partition the gym, allowing two 
games 10 be played without 
interference. 

Additionally, RIMAC houses 
eight racquetball and two squash 
courts on the second Hoor. Air-
conditioned with wooden floors 
and textured glass the courts 
facilitate viewing. The courts can 
be reserved at the site or by 
telephone. Equipment such as 
rackets, racquetballs, basketballs 
and volleyballs can also be checked 
out on the second level at the 
Equipment Storage and Check-out 
adjacent to the courts. Lockers are 
also avai lable on the econd floor. 

RrMAC offers myriad faciliti es 
and programs to keep students in 
shape. Students pay $70 a quaner 
regardless of whcthcr they utilize 
the complex or not. 

"This is a little Icss co tly than 
a health club. such as Family 
Fitncss," said Chadwick. "And 
with thi s you get a little more - it's 
not just a weight room, there are 
also ba kctball courts, racquetball 
courts, there's a train ing ccnter that 
we have downstairs for thc' teams, 
and the arena."

WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ON PROP. 209? 

I'm not for 209. because 
it opposes affirmative 
action. I favor affinnative 
action. It needs to be con-
tinued because 40 years of 
affinnative action doesn't 
make up for 500 years of 
oppression. 

. NOIIII , .......... 
Marshall Sophomore 

Interviews by Grace Jang • Photography by Alii Macisaac 

I'm definitely voting no 
on it. It's really an indica-
tion that the state doesn' t 
feel it's necessary to sup-
port people In a less 
advantaged situation. It's 
also an indication that 
racism is beginning to sur-
face again to the top. 

c .............. 
Roosevelt Sop~omore 

It's pretty bad as far as 
minorities are considered. 
Minorities need all the 
help they can get. It 's bad 
for women, too because it 
will keep women o'ut of 
higher paying jobs as well. 
There is a glass ceiling for 
women and no one waflts 
to admit that. [Prop 209) 
will hinder a lot of oppor-
tunities for everybody. 

I support affirmative 
action until we can find a 
better system of improving 
equality in school s and 
institutions but ideally, we 
should reach a point where 
we don 't need it anymore. 
But I need to study [Prop 
209) before I really know 
whether I totally support it 
or not. 

Prop. 209 is going to 
have a positive influence 
on the whole situation in 
California. We need to 
revamp affirmative action. 
It is not working effective-
ly the way it is. Times 
change, people change, so 
we need to adapt our gov-
ernment litigations to fit 
the times better.

SLIGHT: The 
NCAA hurts UCSD 
Continued from page 20 
home gym. 

J • 

Granted, UCSD wi ll host the Wa· 
ter Polo Final Four. but in my opinion. 
Ihe Tri ton hould ho t NCAA 
Regionals for at/east the first rounds 
in both soccers and volleyball. 

UCSD posses es one of the best 
sports fa cilities- RIMAC - in the 
country, let alone on the West Coast. 
Our women 's volleyball squad is 
currently ranked fourth in the nation 
with a 20·6 record. 

The women's soccer team wi ll try 
to defend its title when Ihey steam roll 
into the playoffs with a 14· 1 record 
and the top ranking in the nation. And 
the men's soccer team looks to im· 
prove on their 10·5 mark and assure 
themselves of a playoff spot. 

Too many times in the past, UCSD 
teams have gotten screwed by the 
NCAA committee undeservedly. lf it 
were up to me, I would let the best 
team, with the best record, and the 
best faci lities getthe chance to host. A 
man can' t ask for much more. 

Well maybe a new car and some 
money but I don't want to get greedy.

CCAA Provides Fast Test on Road to Nationals 
MIRROR IMAGES: With a flat course leading to a host of record times, both the men's and women's squads captured second 
place in the conference championships at Cal Poly Pomona, providing a final tune up for the NCAA Western Regionals 
By Kevin Mclaughlin 
Staff Writer 

Success continues to follow the 
Triton cross country team. Having 
left the comfort of the home course 

behind, the racers 
headed north to 
Pomona this week-
end to engage in a 
showdown with the 
other four team in 
the CCAA confer-
ence to determine a 
champion. 

Although both the men' and 
women 's teams finished in second 
place, it was still a tremendous event 
for the combined squad, marking 
the first time in hi tory that both 
teams were runners-up in the same 
year. 

Running on a relatively flat Cal 
Poly'Pomona course, the men were 
ab le to establish some impressive 
records. The first three racers 
crossed the line with the top course 
times in UCSD history, with each 
of the three ac hieving personal 
bests. 

Gavin Klinger led the team yet 
again, fini shing in fifth with a time 
01"24:52. Rhodes Walton was next 
in seventh, while Brian Leek re-
turned to action 10 fini sh ninth. 
Though times are not as relevant 
a place'ment in determining team 
victory. three runners fi ni shing 
under 25 :00 is a rare and impres-

ive feal. 
Leek, slowed for much of the 

season with illness. gave the team 
a big lift with senior experience 
and stellar running. He had not 
raced si nce the Stanford Invita-
tional, but the exte nded layoff 
didn't slow him. 

The return of the rejuvenated 
Leek give the team a good chance 
to have three All-Americans, with 
the speedy Klinger and the emerg-
ing Walton leaving their comp< ti-
tors in the dust. Juniors Neal Han er 
and Mike Wallace rounded ou t t Ie 
scoring five for UCSD. both rUI -
ning personal bests over the five 
mile course. 

Sophomore Franzwa Achie and 
junior Steve Varnell, both of whom 
ran over40 seconds fasterthan their 
personal bests, complete the quad 
that will travel to the NCAA 
regionals in two week . 

Only the Broncos of Cal Poly 
Pomona were able to Outrun the 
motivated Tritons. With a group of 
five runners sticking together. the 
home team showed some strategic 
pack racing, surging at set times and 
comm uni ca ting throughout the 
event. 

Hyou gain about 10 seconds on 
your home course," team captain 
Walton said, "We want to use more 
pack trategy in Regionals.'· 

The women, meanwhile, were 
nipped by Grand Canyon College in 

an exciting race. Though the 10Tri-
tons easily beat the combined Grand 
Canyon squad. only the top five 
runners are used for coring, gi vi ng 
the favored GCC team the edge by 
three points. 

Sophomore standouts Jenny Card 
and Maggie Dwire again led the 
team. placing fifth and seventh, re-
spectively. Freshman Amy Kitchen 
"stepped up significantly" to finish 
third on the women's squad, illus-
trating the depth of "the best com-
petitive [women's1 team we have 
had in years," according to Head 
Coach Ted Van Arsdale. 

The women's team turned a num-
ber of heads against its Division II 
opponent s. with 13 runners break-
ing 20:00 forthe 5000 metercour e. 
The performance on Saturday pUIS 
the women in good position on their 
way to qualifying for the national 
champion hips. The team i cur-
renlly ranked in the top 25 of Divi-
sion lIl. -

With both the men and women 
finishing second. the runner es-
tablished themselves as the most 
balanced team in the conference. 
Augmenting thi s claim, the "B" 
squad put forth an exce llent effort 
in a eparate race. The men 's squad 
was ab le tocapture the team cham-
pionship in the Bronco Invita-
tional. held on the same course 
prior 10 the Conference Champi-
onships. 

Junior Rich 
Erkki la stepped for-
ward to run the Tri-
ton s' ninth fastest 
time on Saturday, 
while Margaret 
Wikander turned in 
the eighth best time 
for the women. This 
is a particularly bright 
accomplishment for 
Wikander, who has 
greatly improved 
since beginning the 
yearastheNo. 18run-
ner for the team. 

The team now sets 
ils sights on Regionals 
on Nov. 9. the precur-
sorto National Cham-
pionships. Aside from 
a wave of sickness that 
has hit a few of the 
female runners, both 
teams are right where 
they want to be. After 
running such a fasl 
race this weekend, t he 
team is brimming with 
confidence.

to competiti on. 

"Any bumps or stumps we've hit

Van Arsdale proudly said of hi s 
racers, "Stepping into ReglOnal s.

East vs. West: 
Who's the Boss? 

I wondenometime . 
Is there any way that we, 3l> a 

society, can overcome our 
inherent prej udices and li ve 
peacefully among l each oLher? 

• How do they get that creamy 
lilling inside a twinkie? And i 
there an East Coasl bias 
penneating the NCAA ~e lcction 
committee? 

Because I don'L have Lhe 
slightest idea on how to 
intelligently answer lhe first two 
queslions, I will tackle the laller. 

The East Coast vs. West 
Coasl bailIe has been part of our 
history as far back as I can 
remember, whelher iI's a 
compelilion 10 see which 
coastline has the best universi-
ties, or Ihe East vs. Wesl bikini 
pageant on lhe "Richard Bey 
Show." And as witnessed in 
recent headlines, Wesl Coast 
gangsta rappers drop the lyrics 
on East Coasl homeys, marking 
lheir territory on the music 
chans. Many helieve Ihat 2Pac 
Shakur' murder was a possible 
hit by East Coa t rapper The 
Notorious B.I.G. Bull don 't 
wanlJo lose my while readers so 
I must MOp digressing. 

In thi context, I am referring 
to the practices of the NCAA 
selection committee. 

Fir t, I must ex plain what the 
aforementioned committcc's 
duty entai ls. A group of 
distingliished stuffshirts sits in 
its New York oflice, trying to 
fonnulate a supposedly fair 
playoff bra ket for the respective 
fall sports: men' occer, 
women's volleyball, men' 
water polo and women's soccer. 

Going by the rule book, Lhese 
selections sh uld be made by 
accqunt ing for numerou factors. 
For example, they must consider 
a team\ current record and 
national ranking, previous years 
of hosting a regional playoff 
event and the faci litie ' avai lable 
fo r usc by the univer ities on 
hand. 

In their hands, the commillee 
controb the f~te of every 
Division III 'chool's playoff 
schedule. If they feel like it, they 
send an undefeated volleyball 
team from the West to playa 
mediocre squad from Iowa, only 
because the team from the 
Midwest won it conference. 

By Steve Walsh 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

William Shakespeare once 
wrole, "Parting is such sweet sor-
row." Apparently, the writing great 
did not inlend these immortal 
words forthe UCSD women 's vol -
leyball leam, which is making a 
charge for Ihe nalional champion-
ship behind Ihe leadership of six 
deparling seniors. 

No sorrow was evidenl Salur-
day, when the Trilons bid a 
fond farewell 10 Iheir seniors 
by destroying Ihe Universily 
of La Verne in Ihe final regu-
lar-season home malch . 
Chri sline Chi , Mieke 
Bi es heuvel , Kelly 
McGlolhlin , Shelly Graf, 
Ann e Su and Made lyn 
Ripken were honored prior 
10 Ihe contesl and given their final 
opportunity to Ian together. This 
provided a special moment for the 
Triton , as Su started despite a 
torn anterior cruti ate ligament that 
occured ea rlier thi s season. Su 
played the first point before being 
replaccd and was given a tanding 
ovati on by th c full housc at 
RIMAe. . 

"Everyone was really exci ted 
that we could start all ix of the 
seniors," Head Coach Duncan 
McFarland said, "We weren' Lure 
about Ann being able to start until 
j ust a few days ago." 

Riding a wave of emoti on, 
UCS D jumped ahead of vis iting 
Leopards before they knew what 
hit them. Behind the huge fronl-
court play of hi, who used the

quick set to tally a team-high 10 
kill s, the Tritons had La Verne 
back on ils heels for much of Ihe 
malch. Sherine Ebadi , who re-
placed Su, blasted Ihe Leopards 
with a viciou jump serve as Ihe 
Trilons look advantage of the poor 
passing skill s of their opponents 
to streak ahead 10- 1. Following a 
eries of sideouts , UCSD capilal -

ized on ils front -court advanlage 
by blocking two conseculive hilS 

for poinls. Afler surrender-
ing only one more poinl, 
Ihe Trilons mercifully put 
away La Verne in game one, 
15-2. 

The new scenery after 
changing sides of the court 
must have provided some 
motivati on for the Leop-

ards, who came out fir ing in game 
two. Jusl as La Verne began to hit 
its stride, the Triton found them-
selves liding into a mini -s lump. 

"(Small slumps) have bee n 
plaguing us all season," McFarland 
sa id. "The squad hits a spot in the 
match where they forget thai 
they' re the betlerteam. We lend 10 
kill ourown momentum with poor 
serves and errors, but it 's some-
thing we' re working on ." 

Unable to pull everything to-
gether, the Trilon were looking at 
a defi cit on the scoreboard fo r Ihe . 
first time all match. Rather than 
give up the game, UCS D rallied 
behind its enior leadershi p to 
bounce back into content ion. With 
Biesheuvel swingi ng hard dow n 
the line ' and the left-handed 
Ri pken hilling cros court ovcrlhe 

La Verne block, the Tri-
tons mounted a comeback 
to knot the score at 13-
13. 

With sideouts work-
ing for both teams, UCSD 
u ed its big block to cap-
ture the serve. Once agai n 
it was the poor pa, ing of 
La Verne, that came 10 
the rescue as the Trilons 
squeaked horne Ihe last
