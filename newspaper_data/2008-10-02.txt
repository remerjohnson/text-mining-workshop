ROUGH AND ROWDY LIVING WHEN XX MEETS XY ▶ OPINION, PAGE 4

The UC Board of Regents 
approved new regulations governing 
the conduct of nonaffiliates on uni-
versity property during its September 
meeting, to the surprise of students 
and other members of the campus 
community concerned with free-
speech infringement.

The new regulations, which were 
released as a draft last May and dis-
cussed during a UCLA public hearing 
this June, impose restrictions on the 
activities of nonaffiliates, including a 
ban on all demonstrations or gather-
ings on UC property without prior 
university approval.  

Violation of the new policies will 
be punishable as a misdemeanor. 

Associated Students commit-
tee representative Carol-Irene 
Southworth, who has been working 
for the past year with a campus com-
mittee to review the proposed policy 
and create a UCSD alternative — reg-
ulating free speech, assembly and dis-
tribution of literature — was unaware 
that the regulations proposed by the 
UC Office of the President had been 
approved by the regents until after 

the vote had taken place.
“As far as the policy being adopt-

ed, UCOP’s position has been that the 
students and affiliates do not need 
to be made aware of this proposal, 
because it cannot directly incrimi-
nate us as we are not nonaffiliates,” 
Southworth said.

A.S. President Donna Bean was  
similarly critical of UCOP’s failure to 
inform the public of the proceedings. 

“Students were not made ade-
quately aware of this timeline,” Bean 
said. “It’s also important to note that 
this entire thing went though the 
committee on finance. They are not 
as well-versed with the language [as 
other committees] and this is an 
obvious frustration.”

UCOP spokesman Trey Davis said 
regents meetings are always public-
ly announced in advance and that 
the public had the opportunity to 
submit comments, which were then 
reviewed and taken into consider-
ation by UCOP.

“Written comments were also sub-
mitted by the public, faculty, students 
and other members of the UC com-
munity,” Davis said. “Several changes 
were made to the proposed regula-
tions as a result of public comments 
that were received.”

According to Davis, the regula-
tions were considered by the finance 
committee as a facet of university 
operations, and that the entire board 
has always voted on issues only after

Preuss Report Calls for Tighter 
Grade Security, Smaller Board

By Reza Farazmand
News Editor

Nearly a year after a controversial 
audit report detailed the habitual prac-
tice of illicit grade-tampering at UCSD’s 
Preuss School — a sixth- through 12th-
grade charter institution — campus offi-
cials released a second review last week 
focused on investigating the school’s 
post-audit managerial practices.

Conducted by an independent con-
sulting firm, the 71-page report touches 
upon several problems perceived within 
the nationally acclaimed charter school, 
including the distribution of diplomas 
to students who met only district rather 
than school-specific graduation require-
ments and a school board deemed to be 
unwieldy in size and overly authorita-
tive in nature.

Additionally, while the report com-
mends Preuss officials for improving 
upon the security and accuracy of 
grade reporting since the 2007 audit, 
recommendations were made to con-
tinue building upon existing internal 
controls, such as limiting access to the 
school’s grade-reporting system to only 
three key administrators. 

Despite these criticisms, Preuss offi-
cials view the latest report as generally 
positive. Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs Paul Drake, who oversees por-
tions of the school’s administration, said 
the review tells of the success Preuss has 
had in upholding its core educational 
mission. 

“I would be horrified if it came back 
and said ‘the school is not meeting 
its educational mission; it’s not taking 
underprivileged kids and getting them 
in college,’” Drake said. “It is. Over 
90 percent are getting into college. It’s 
doing a fantastic job. It’s ranked among 
the top 10 schools in the nation. So, on 
fundamentals, it’s doing great. I read 
this report as saying ‘this is a funda-
mental success, how can it be even 
better?’”

The report also deemed administra-
tive practices not in line with those typi-
cally employed by other charter schools, 
including the school’s current manage-
rial setup, which is less hierarchical 
than most. 

Chair of the Preuss School Board 
Sandra Daly attributed these devia-

Unbeknownst to most students 
Warren College’s Atkinson Hall has, 
for over a year, been housing a 360-
degree virtual reality room — the 
StarCAVE. And yes, it’s as techno-
logically advanced as it sounds. 

Consisting of a pentagon-shaped 
room outfitted with 15 wall-mount-
ed projection screens, StarCAVE is 
a virtual reality simulator that ren-
ders 3D objects and environments 
in a realistic, almost tangible man-
ner. The technology has a number 
of practical applications, including 
the visualization of protein chains 
for biological research and the pro-
jection of architectural structures 
which viewers are able to interact 
with as if in real life.

The image quality of projections 
in a five-walled room is greater 
than was possible in cubic-shaped 
virtual reality rooms.

Primary StarCAVE contributor Jurgen Schulze demonstrates the cave’s simulator program. The virtual

“As with your laptop, if you look 
at the screen at an angle, it makes 
the picture more difficult to see,” 
said Jurgen Schulze, a project scien-
tist at Cal-(IT)2 and main contribu-
tor to the StarCAVE. “It eventually 
goes dark. The cubic rooms had all 

90-degree angles, but the pentago-

He’s an A.S. Programming dream come true: modest on the bass, doesn’t flail his limbs too much, generally avoids obscene gestures — all the while scoring UCSD’s FallFest some controversy-free street cred (at 
least with the wide-eyed freshman crowd) on a sleepy, huggable, beanbag flow, 
one that would never dream of degrading a ho or scoring a drive-by. He’s a 
lost-collegiate-soul magnet with his head screwed on tight, pants pulled up 
proper and spectacles to boot.

The only danger: Dude might not heed the “no skateboarding” signs.
Just three years back, at one of Kanye West’s most overwhelming career 

peaks, Lupe Fiasco was finding his way from his Chicago ’hood into hip-hop’s 
most prestigious campus one nonchalant verse at a time, and gathered a fair crowd 
with copious online mixtapes even before he got the inevitable news — Jay-Z’s next-
big-thing detector had swung his way, and was screeching like a canary in heat. 

No helpless raw talent can avoid the great Hova wing for long, and usually doesn’t 
come to regret the benefits; once safely tucked under, Fiasco stepped onstage for a 
bangin’ breakout cameo alongside the notorious Mr. West in 2005’s Curtis Mayfield-
ripping “Touch the Sky” — young, breezy and with “Peach fuzz buzz but beard on 
the verge.” He used the instant fame as a slingshot for his own shticky and danger-
ously talked-about (by indie ’zines and MTV alike) first single “Kick, Push,” 
an unparalleled feat in neighborhood boom-box jazz, apparently 
sponsored not only by the gods of good-boy hip-hop them-
selves but the top names in the skate shop as well.

Rap hadn’t been this cuddly since we first 
heard whisper of N.E.R.D’s sweet nothings. In 
the debut single, Pharrell-lookalike Fiasco took the 
action down to the park with the boys, leading us through 
a wildly relatable storyline — regular dude escapes life bummers 
on his trusty board, really digs the coast of it, even meets a down 
chick that can more than keep up with all the kicking and push-
ing. “Landed on his hip and busted his lip / For a week he had 
to talk with a lisp, like thisss,” Fiasco spits in cross-armed 
emphasis on the homely video, between strategic shots 
of kicks and axels. A little commercial, no doubt, 
but who wouldn’t swap an ounce or two of soul 
for those shiny new Vans in the window?

Campus Reaches Out to 
Budding Scientists

UCSD doctoral students teamed 
up with high-school teachers this 
summer to launch an innovative 
new program designed to encour-
age more San Diego County high-
school students to pursue careers 
in the sciences.

Designed by a UCSD gradu-
ate student and a high-school 
teacher in the Sweetwater Union 
High School District, the Socrates 
Fellows Program was financed by 
a $3-million grant from the National 
Science Foundation.

“What’s exciting about this grant 
is that we hope it will help us address 
a major national problem, which is 
that there are not enough science 
students in the science pipeline,” 
said Maarten Chrispeels, a UCSD 
biology professor and co-principal 
investigator of the grant.

Working beside graduate stu-
dents, nine Socrates fellows from 
UCSD will spend roughly 12 hours 
per week in high-school classrooms 
throughout San Diego, Oceanside, 
Sweetwater and Grossmont school

districts during this school year. 
Students will measure the amount 
of amylase in their saliva, test ocean 
core samples and participate in 
other experiments that incorporate 
cutting-edge science and practical 
applications.

“When you’re in an actual lab 
you get the feeling that it has real-
life applications,” said Nicole Garcia, 
17, a student at Castle Park High 
School in Chula Vista. “You start 
opening your mind to this idea that 
maybe I too can do this when I get 
older.”

Dean of Graduate Students Kim 
Barrett said the participating high 
schools often have a high percent-
age of underrepresented students, 
making the program consistent with 
UCSD’s outreach mission. 

“The university will become 
not just this faceless enclave in La 
Jolla,” he said.

Viterbi Receives National 
Medal of Science

Former UCSD professor and 
wireless pioneer Andrew Viterbi was 

awarded a National Medal of Science 
this week, in part for his work on 
cell-phone technology known as the 
Viterbi algorithm.

The inention efficiently decodes 
digital transmission sequences to 
recover the original audio of cell 
phone signals and eliminate noise 
interference. 

Viterbi is a founder of San Diego 
startup Linkabit and a co-founder of 
Qualcomm. He also made important 
contributions to the Code Division 
Multiple Access wireless technology, 
which revolutionized the theory of 
digital communications.

“Andrew Viterbi’s impact in wire-
less communications has been 
utterly profound,” said Larry Larson, 
professor and chair of the depart-
ment of electrical and computer engi-
neering at UCSD’s Jacobs School 
of Engineering. “Virtually every cell 
phone in use today employs the 
Viterbi algorithm.”

The algorithm is still used the 
same way as when it was invented, 
but the hardware requirements have 
changed, Larson said.

“When first invented, the Viterbi 
algorithm was incredibly efficient but 
still took a big computer to run it,” 

Larson said. “Now the same algo-
rithm can be implemented on a tiny 
sliver of silicon. It’s now so easy to 
implement. I think the Viterbi algo-
rithm is like addition and subtraction: 
We’ll still be using it in a thousand 
years.”

For example, when space probes 
send messages back from Jupiter, 
researchers use the Viterbi algorithm 
to remove noise after millions of miles 
of travel and decode the signals.

Ramesh Rao, director of the 
UCSD division of the California 
Institute for Telecommunications 
and Information Technology and a 
Jacobs School professor of electri-
cal engineering, said he is proud 
to work with Viterbi on the Cal-(IT)2 
Advisory Board. 

“Through the Viterbi algorithm and 
his co-founding of Qualcomm, Andy 
Viterbi has had a seminal influence 
on the building blocks of the wire-
less revolution,” Rao said. “As an 
information theorist himself, he has 
been a supporter from day one of our 
Information Theory and Applications 
Center, which seeks to apply the 
methods embodied in information 
theory to other disciplines, especially 
systems biology.”

an increase.
Currently, a lack of sufficient 

funding threatens to cripple the A.S. 
Programming office. Subsequently, 
the results of the 2008 survey were 
used to formulate the referendum pre-
sented at last night’s meeting, which if 
approved would provide the finances 
that various organizations, events and 
services.

Members of the council hammered 
out their issues with the $42 per stu-
dent per year referendum, which is 
broken down as follows: $12 for stu-
dent organizations, $16.50 program-

ming and about 
$3 for other A.S. 
line items.  

Chen expressed  
concern that the 
council would have 
only seven weeks 
to campaign for 
the referendum.

“If the referendum doesn’t pass, 
then my office is in an impossible 
situation,” Berg said in response. “We’d 
have to cancel all of our winter pro-
gramming and our spring program-
ming and still not have enough money 
for Sun God.”  

Bean pointed out that council has 
never had a referendum before, and 
that this one is long overdue.

“If [the referendum doesn’t pass], a 
lot of people are going to hate us this 
year,” she said. 

The council will vote on the refer-
endum next Wednesday.

Toward the end of the meet-
ing, Physical Sciences Senator Rishi 
Ghosh broke the news of his depar-
ture from council and UCSD due to 
personal reasons. He urged the coun-
cil to continue to pay close attention 
to issues he worked intimately with, 
such as opposing the recently passed 
systemwide nonaffiliate free speech 
policy. 

The first official A.S. Council meeting of the year com-menced somewhat slug-
gishly after much lighthearted chat-
ter between members regarding their 
respective summer adventures. 

During public input, Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Gary 
Ratcliff welcomed the council’s return 
and gave a quick update on the new 
eateries in Price Center East. He also 
plugged the unveiling of the Triton 
Sculpture at the base of the Triton 
steps on Oct. 16 at 11 a.m.

Associate Vice President of 
P r o g r a m m i n g 
Garrett Berg 
reminded every-
one that FallFest 
and the Stunna 
Shades Dance 
in the Loft are 
this Friday and 
Saturday, respec-
tively. He urged everyone to arrive 
early at the events to increase their 
chances of getting in. 

On a more somber note, Vice 
President of External Affairs Lisa 
Chen urged councilmembers to help 
with the A.S. voter-registration effort, 
which has thus far garnered the assis-
tance of only three members.

The night’s heavyweight issue was 
introduced about 45 minutes into 
the meeting, when A.S. President 
Donna Bean, Berg and Associate Vice 
President of Student Organizations 
Utsav Gupta  presented the proposed 
A.S. Activity Fee Referendum for Fall 
2008.

In 2008, the council distributed 
a survey asking students to select 
the A.S. services and programs that 
they most support. Rounding out the 
favorites were the Sun God Festival, 
student organization events and A.S. 
Safe Ride, for which 54 percent of stu-
dents said they would support paying

Facing Funding Deficit, Councilmembers 
Propose Emergency Referendum

By Christina Homer
Senior Staff Writer

Due to financial difficulties, renova-
tions at Plaza Cafe have been suspended 
indefinitely, prompting campus officials 
to delay similar construction efforts at 
Sierra Summit and El Mercado. Both 
dining facilities will remain in operation 
for the entirety of the academic year.

According to Housing and Dining 
Services Executive Director Mark 
Cunningham, the Housing, Dining and 
Hospitality Service is a self-supporting 
enterprise that must plan projects with-
in its budget without outside funding 
sources, and the allotted funds for the 
Plaza Cafe project proved insufficient. 

“We set a specific budget for the 
Plaza Cafe renovation but, as with any 
construction project, and in particular 
with a major renovation of our largest 
and oldest dining facility, we are subject 
to the impacts of the local construction 
industry in terms of costs of materials 
and labor combined with the amount 
of work that we wanted to accom-
plish,” Cunningham said in an e-mail. 
“Unfortunately, after working closely 
with our selected architects to look for 
every possible solution, we were not 
able to bring the overall project to our 
available budget.”

DHHS will be working with 
the UCSD Facilities Design and 
Construction group to assess alterna-
tive options for continuing the Plaza 
Cafe renovations at a lower cost.

Since planning of the renovations 
of Sierra Summit and Plaza Cafe were 
sequential, their timelines were directly 

connected. Cunningham said the hold 
on the Plaza project will directly affect 
the timeliness of the Sierra Summit 
project’s completion.  

“We had to approach them this way 
because we couldn’t have both facili-
ties offline at the same time, so Sierra 
Summit had to be completed before 
Plaza could start,” he said. “With the 
Plaza renovation on hold, that no lon-
ger poses an issue and we can stay 
open through the school year and not 
inconvenience our customers by having 
Sierra Summit closed.”

Sierra Summit and El Mercado ren-

ovations are slated to begin immediately 
following the 2008-09 academic year. 
However, this delay will not change the 
size or scope for the renovation of the 
John Muir College dining halls.

These projects will update 40-year-
old infrastructure that is becoming 
costly to replace and bring the din-
ing halls to Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design certification 
standards, which measure the sustain-
ability of buildings.

being voted forward by a committee.
Southworth expressed disap-

pointment that certain wording in 
the policy was not revised, making 
the rules too vague and danger-
ously open to interpretation, there-
by allowing administrators to stifle 
free speech and demonstrations.  

Concerned about the clause 
requiring nonaffiliates to receive 
prior approval before demonstrat-
ing, Southworth declared it not only 
unconstitutional, but also a poten-
tial threat to student freedom. 

“This rule could shut down 
student demonstrations as well,” 
Southworth said. “If the police or 
administrators have the authority 
to make everyone stop and prove 
they are affiliates [by asking them 
to show their ID cards], then they 
could delay and put down student 
rallies.”

At this week’s A.S. Council meet-
ing, Physical Sciences Senator Rishi 
Ghosh expressed apprehension 
that the regulations could threaten 
the ability of American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal 
Employees — the union represent-
ing UC patient-care and service 
workers, who are currently engaged 
in negotiations with the university 
over wages and pensions — to effec-
tively hold demonstrations. 

“Something that concerns us is 
the fact that the nonaffiliate policy 
will hurt the AFSCME communi-
ty a lot, since they are technically 
considered nonaffiliates,” Ghosh 
said. “The laws that apply to public 
places do not apply to the university 
despite the fact that this is a public 
university and that this is a space.”

AFSCME has held several public 
demonstrations on the UCSD cam-
pus over the past year. 

“AFSCME’s struggle makes this 
element of the policy especially rel-
evant right now,” Southworth said, 
asserting that the policy’s approval 
is not the final word on free speech 
at UCSD and that the committee is 
more committed than ever to pro-
ducing a working policy that cannot 
be abused. 

The campus speech policy com-
mittee will have its first meeting 
of the quarter on Oct. 7, where 
members will set up protocol and 
make decisions on the implementa-
tion of the new regulations, accord-
ing to Associate Controller Sally 
Brainerd.

CAVE is to being a perfectly spheri-
cal shape, the easier it is to view the 
images.”

The 3D eyewear used in visualiza-
tion has also been improved upon 
from previous generations of the 3D 
simulator. Instead of requiring heavy, 
battery-operated “shutter” glasses, 
the newest incarnation of the simu-
lator employs lightweight, polarized 
glasses similar to everyday eyewear. 
Styles range from big and bug-eyed to 
wrap-around, each easy and comfort-
able to wear.

While engaged in the simulation, 
viewers also wear a visor fitted with 
a tracking system on top, allowing 
the CAVE to monitor the locations 
of those engaged in the simulation 
at all times and to adjust the visual-
izations accordingly. When viewing 
a building, for example, the viewer 
is able to circle it freely and even 
experience the feeling of moving 
through it. 

StarCAVE has proved particularly 
useful in the study of proteins. Inside 
the CAVE, scientists can maneuver 
proteins so as to view them from 
their preferred angle. Viewers can 
choose to not only rotate the proteins, 
but view them from either inside 
(where one can see individual chains) 
or outside (a colorful, lumpy sphere 
with divots where surface proteins 
are located).

 In addition, each chain is color-
coded, allowing scientists to discern 

between several distinct proteins.
The viewer controls his or her 

visualization experience with a joy-
stick. When viewing images in 3D, 
the joystick projects a purple “wand,” 
which resembles a lightsaber out of 
“Star Wars” and is used to select and 
move images for research purposes, 
moving easily and rapidly around the 
screen in response to the direction of 
the viewer’. 

The StarCAVE is being used for 
medical, biological, and archaeologi-
cal visualizations. 

“We can display CT and MRI 
scans, as well as confocal images, 
using biological statistics,” Schulze 
said. 

The team has also worked with 
UCSD archaeology professor Tom 
Levy in order to visualize ancient 
excavation sites in Jordan, Schulze 
said.

CAVE (CaveAutomatic Virtual 
Environment) technology has been 
used for virtual reality simulations 
since 1991, when the first CAVE 
was constructed by a group led by 
Tom DeFanti, who is currently the 
director of visualization at Cal-(IT)2. 
StarCAVE, built by the UCSD divi-
sion of Cal-(IT)2, represents the 
third-generation model of this tech-
nology. 

The StarCAVE project took less 
than $1 million to complete.

tions to the unique circumstances of the 
Preuss School. 

“Preuss is a middle school and 
a high school embedded in a uni-
versity, and we have a manage-
ment review team that is coming 
to this unique place to evaluate 
it, using as standards of reference 
charter schools that are not neces-
sarily modeled this way and using 
language that doesn’t pertain to the 
way the university naturally oper-
ates,” Daly said.

A number of recommenda-
tions were also made regarding the 
school’s current lack of cohesive 
policies and procedures in areas per-
taining to management and internal 
operations. Daly said this criticism 
doesn’t necessarily reflect any major 
problem within the school’s admin-
istration or core ideals, but rather 

serves as a reminder of the impor-
tance of policy cohesion in running 
such an institution. 

“All they are trying to get us to 
appreciate is that it is important 
to write out the procedures that 
clearly describe who is responsible 
for what and when,” Daly said. 

Preuss came under fire late last 
year when an internally conducted 
audit revealed over 400 counts of 
incorrectly recorded grades, 72 per-
cent of which the audit stated result-
ed in higher grades for the affected 
students. Controversy surrounding 
the audit’s findings led former Preuss 
principal Doris Alvarez to step down 
from her position in December 2007 
amid what she referred to as pres-
sure from the university.

OPINION
THURSDAY, OCTOBER 2, 2008

EDITORIALS

In its meeting last month the UC Board of Regents approved new systemwide regulations, dramati-
cally changing the university’s free 
speech policy — nonaffiliates are now 
banned from spontaneous public 
assembly on the university’s 10 cam-
puses. This blatant and disgusting 
disregard for the Constitution’s First 
Amendment was inexplicably pushed 
through the regents’ finance commit-
tee, with minimal consideration of 
public input or notice for students. 

Aside from how offensive this 
unconstitutional policy change is, it’s 
also absurd. The university is a public 
entity, funded largely by taxpayer dol-
lars. How can the regents expect to 
exclude citizens from a resource they 
fund? Limiting the free exchange of 
ideas at the university is nothing if not 
detrimental to its students. Supporters 
of the measure argue that nonaffiliates 
are sometimes bothersome, preaching 
to co-eds. But a real-world education 
exposes students to new ideas, some of 
which they may find uncomfortable. In 
addition to being arguably illegal, the 
new policy artificially isolates the uni-
versity — it’s all harm and no good. 

This policy approval comes amid 
wage negotiations with the American 
Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees, which have 
sparked several on-campus protests. 
While the university denies that this 
influenced the change, it’s obvious 

how convenient the regulations are for 
regents, now allowing them to silence 
nonaffiliate protests with the threat of 
legal action. 

Both the committee currently 
reviewing UCSD’s free speech poli-
cy and the A.S. Council have already 
expressed outrage over the decision. 
But UC Office of the President spokes-
man Trey Davis defended the new 
systemwide policy, asserting that “sev-
eral changes” were made in response 
to input from both the public and UC 
community. Davis’ claims are as outra-
geous and laughable as the unconstitu-

tional policy he’s attempting to support. 
Attachment C of the UCOP finance 
committee report recommending the 
policy adoption is a 12-page list of such 
comments, the vast majority of which 
express objection to or concern over the 
banning of nonaffiliates. Each of these 
comments received the same response: 
“The university has determined that 
these comments do not warrant a revi-
sion of the proposed regulations.” 

This university decision is as cor-
rupt as it is shocking, severely calling 
into question the credibility and valid-
ity of the UC Board of Regents.

Humane Cage Conditions 
Worth Increased Egg Costs
Dear Editor,

UCSD college namesake Eleanor 
Roosevelt once said, “A nation may 
be judged by how it treats its most 
vulnerable members.” Proposition 2 
is on the ballot to ensure animals are 
treated humanely enough to be able 
to extend their limbs during their life-
times. I believe an economic impact 
study about the economic harm to 
California’s egg industry with ties to 
wealthy lobbyists and UC Board of 
Regents is about as valid as the current 
administration’s viewpoints on global 
warming or evolution. I would like to 
highlight a few interesting facts.

As a consumer I can expect to pay 
no more than $0.83 for an organic 
free-range grade-A egg. If I choose 
to eat in a restaurant, this margin is 
completely obliterated. The farmers/
corporations that financed equipment 
to increase production are going to 
be hurt because their equipment will 
be obsolete. Proposition 2 legislation 
affects their way of life, and of course 
they will pull all the punches and do 
what they can to defeat the legislation. 
Any way you look at it, egg prices will 

increase because the industry will try 
to recover its costs. Farmers who have 
family farms and sustainable practices 
will be affected in the least.

With higher fuel prices, I think 
it would be difficult for eggs laid in 
Mexico to be arbitraged effectively in 
California for a profit. I think paying 
up to an additional 20 cents an egg 
in the future for something that was 
treated humanely is something I’m 
willing to pay with no questions asked. 
I mean, I’ve been paying more with no 
questions asked for tuition, textbooks 
and fuel for years now.

Proposition 2 Would Make 
California Healthier

Dear Editor,
Proposition 2 will be on the ballot 

this November, and it will affect 20 mil-
lion farm animals in California that live 
all of their lives in cages barely larger 
than their bodies. I gathered 1,300 hun-
dred signatures for this initiative.

It simply asks that these animals 
have enough room to sit down, stand 
up, turn around and stretch their limbs. 
Pregnant pigs live in two-by-seven foot 

cages in which they can’t even turn 
around. Egg-laying hens are confined 
to areas smaller than the size of a regu-
lar sheet of paper. Calves raised for veal 
are tethered by the neck and are unable 
to lie down in a natural position.

The initiative will also improve 
food safety and safeguard the environ-
ment. Increased use of antibiotics in 
stressed and unhealthy farm animals 
contribute to the growing problem of 
antibiotic-resistant pathogens. These 
antibiotics end up in our food and 
waterways, which is why the American 
Public Health Association has called for 
a moratorium on these operations. The 
European Union has already banned 
such practices. Arizona and Florida 
have passed similar measures.

Endorsers of the initiative include 
the California Veterinary Medical 
Association, the Center for Food 
Safety, the Union of Concerned 
Scientists, the Humane Society, the 
Consumer Federation of America, the 
United Farm Workers, the Sierra Club 
and hundreds of other organizations, 
veterinarians and concerned leaders. 
Proposition 2 is a modest initiative that 
will improve our health, environment 
and the lives of millions of animals.

Animals Provide Sustenance, 
Deserve Roomy Cages 

Dear Editor,
Proposition 2 is a very modest 

measure that extends the most basic 
comforts to the animals that provide 
sustenance to the voters who will be 
deciding their future treatment in 
November. As a vegetarian, I would 
prefer complete freedom for all ani-
mals, but I know that is not the senti-
ment of most people. 

However, I do strongly believe 
that the vast majority of people would 
not support the kind of confinement 
that these animals have to currently 
endure. Could you imagine if you 
had to raise, in your own backyard, 
your own hens for eggs, pigs for meat 
and calves for veal? How would you 
choose to confine them? Would you 
pay the extra 20 percent in produc-
tion costs, amounting to less than 
1 cent per egg (according to a UC 
Davis report), to allow the hens to 
open up their wings, a natural habit 
necessary for them to thoroughly 
clean themselves? Would you give 
up a couple of square feet of your 
rose garden to allow the calves to lie 
down properly? 

I would imagine that anyone with 
a pet would spend the extra couple 
of dollars to buy a cage suitable for 
its size, and even though they may 
only keep that pet in the cage for 
travel, they would not do so for the 
pet’s entire life. This proposition is a 
matter of giving back to the animals 
that give up their lives for us. Thank 
you for considering the endorse-
ment of Proposition 2. I will person-
ally thank you if you do, and I am 
sure the majority of the student body 
will as well.

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed the revised California Development, Relief and 
Education for Alien Minors Act, 
which would have made financial 
aid available to undocumented stu-
dents, this Tuesday citing the state’s 
“precarious fiscal condition.” But 
this attitude threatens to further 
cripple a state already handicapped 
by budgetary restraints. The gover-
nor is correct — California is in a 
fiscal crisis. However, the way to fix 
California’s finances is certainly not 
by blanket vetoing new bills, partic-
ularly when these bills are so impor-

tant to building the state’s future.
Providing adequate financial aid 

for all of California’s students is nec-
essary. While critics have opposed 
the D.R.E.A.M. Act for condoning 
illegal immigration, taking financial 
aid from taxpaying students and 
placing additional financial burden 
on the state budget, these arguments 
are shallow at best. AB540 already 
allows undocumented students to 
attend UC and CSU campuses at 
in-state rates — that isn’t up for 
debate — and rather than condone 
illegal immigration, the D.R.E.A.M. 
Act would have the reverse effect, 

requiring that recipients take steps 
to attain citizenship. Federal and 
state tax dollars, as well as student 
fees and tuition, fund the univer-
sity. Although undocumented stu-
dents don’t pay income taxes, that’s 
a moot point because the typical 
college-aged citizen doesn’t either; 
both groups pay sales taxes but the 
impact a student’s contribution to 
the system has on the actual aid 
he or she receives is infinitesimal. 
Meanwhile, undocumented students 
are required to pay fees that direct-
ly contribute to the financial-aid 
pool from which they are currently 

excluded.
In many cases, immigration sta-

tus  is out of these students’ hands, 
and they have clearly worked just as 
diligently as their peers to achieve 
admittance to the state’s prestigious 
schools. Barring them from finan-
cial assistance for higher education 
over an issue they can’t control is 
maddening. Yes, California’s financ-
es are overstretched, but education 
should be the state’s top priority.

It is irresponsible and shortsight-
ed of the governor to repeatedly 
ignore legislators by vetoing this 
crucial measure. 

I came home from work the other day and my two roommates were sitting shirtless in our living 
room, eating massive La Salsa burri-
tos and watching “Super Troopers” at 
our six-foot long folding table, which 
we bought expressly for the purpose 
of playing beer pong this past week-
end. For the record, we own no other 
furniture.

No, I don’t live with the two most 
laid-back girlfriends in existence.

I, in fact, live with two very ordi-
nary boys. (Note to B and K: I’m lying 
to them. You’re extraordinary. Please 
don’t lock me out tonight.)

To tell you the truth, my mother 
wasn’t immediately thrilled when I 
announced my intention to live with 
boys. She is, after all, an Asian mother, 
distrustful of anything XY that comes 
in proximity with her one and only little 
girl. I’m sure my brother’s incredulity at 
my decision didn’t  ease her concerns. 
And hell, my dad is still in the dark. As 
a man who finds V-neck shirts scandal-
ous, he’d probably think: co-ed living 
today, prostitution tomorrow. 

How can I accurately describe 
life with two of my best friends? I 
made a spinach-pineapple smoothie, 
and not only were they thoroughly 
unimpressed that I could make a tasty 
vegetable-fruit concoction, they were 
thoroughly disgusted, and went on 
to deliberate the hue of excrement 
that the consumption of green liquids 
might cause. 

To say the least, the maturity level 
in our apartment is overwhelming.

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN By Niven Wilson

We have an “Animal House” poster 
gracing the white space above our fire-
place. They insist on leaving a flash-
light turned on through the night atop 
our mantel because it “looks sick.” I 
mean, I guess. 

I tried to make a case for the Disney 
princesses to join John Belushi, but 
they wouldn’t have it. I’m thinking my 
Jack Bauer poster might fly, but who 
knows? Considering framed pictures 
of myself were effectively banned in 
the apartment, there may be an appli-
cation process for wall space I haven’t 
yet learned about. 

In their company, I — once a serial 
cook — have all but forgotten how to 
grocery shop. At Ralphs, I tried to con-
vince them for a solid five minutes that 
they would not be able to differentiate 
between brown and white eggs. I have 
been to the store three times this week 
and still, the only food to my name 
is a box of granola and some ground 
turkey. 

They remind me with more fre-
quency than my own mother does 
of my very obvious need for physical 
activity (exact words may or may not 
have been: “You remind me of my soup 
… chunky!”). 

Of course, there are perks. My par-
ticipation in my bedrooom furniture’s 
assembly during the move-in process, 
for example, was purely observational. 
They also drive, do all heavy lifting 
and train me not to take offense at any-
thing. Feminism took a stab last week 
as I sat around uselessly and allowed 
the two of them to do things I am 
perfectly capable of doing, like screw-
ing my light bulbs in and testing which 
outlet goes with the switch. 

Sometimes, they make me want to 
hurl myself off my second-story loft. 
Someone will leave the kitchen sink 
clogged with God-knows-what in the 
nonconfrontational hopes that I will, 

as Official Domestic Queen of the 
Apartment, volunteer to take on the 
dirty deed. There will be dishes in the 
sink with saucy, crusted-over remains 
of questionable origin for one too 
many days before I resign from my 
silent  — and unacknowledged, 
I might add — protest and break 
out the Dawn for a scrub session.  
After I gave an exasperated, moth-
erly lecture about the frequency with 
which we all must do dishes, the two 
of them have simply decided to go the 
paper-and-plastic route from here on 
out. Sorry green police, but this envi-
ronmentally unfriendly option dis-
turbs me less than the potential that 
fruit flies will join me for breakfast. 

And then there’s the kicker. Time 
after time — and really, people, it’s 
only been two weeks — I will use the 
restroom, only to discover a forlorn 
cardboard toilet paper roll remaining, 
completely devoid of the toilet-paper 
part. I once loudly mentioned K’s lack 
of enthusiasm for replacing the damn 
thing to a friend who was over at the 
apartment. From his room, K yelled 
shamelessly, “And that’s the way it’s 
going to be!” 

It’s times like those when I start 
wondering why in the world I agreed 
to live in this animal house. 

But then there are times when I 
come home from campus after an 
exhausting day, and K comes up to 
my room, two beers in hand, to talk 
about absolutely nothing. Or when I 
bring them each platefuls of steamed 
dumplings, and they beam at me with 
matching faces, like first graders on 
Christmas morning who just got the 
Lego set they were dying for. And 
when, in the middle of the night, the 
two of them start ricocheting ping-
pong balls off the ceiling and into my 
loft — to see who can hit me squarely 
in the ass. That’s when I remember 
exactly why.

THE BEST SONGS 

IN HIATUS 
THIS WEEK

The street-corner 
sunshine of Fiasco’s first 

full length, Food & Liquor, was 
devoured by critics, almost teary-

eyed at the discovery that geeks could 
now understand and talk about hip-hop in 

their native lingo and not sound like total ass-
holes. Highly digestible diary raps concerning 

his upset in being part of the genre machine (“I 
used to hate hip-hop… yup, because the women 

degraded/ But Too $hort made me laugh, like a hypocrite 
I played it”) go down easy with hunky golden-oldie samples and 

monotone, half-spoken hooks that linger for days.
Like any self-respecting intellectual would do, Fiasco 

kicked Kanye curbside and instead looked to his inner poet 
and Muslim faith for a more full-figured, darker approach 

to jump-rope rhymes on The Cool, his subtly death-
themed sophomore effort. The December 2007 release 

largely pushed soul clips aside for rolling synths and 
uncomfortably paced garbage-can beats, ditching 

Food & Liquor’s recreational arts-and-crafts per-
sona for apocalyptic bio-punk scenarios and the 

ever-popular hard-out-here-
on-the-streets saga. “Even 
Scuba Steve would find it hard 
to breathe/ Around these leagues/ 
My snorkel is a tuba, Lu the ruler 
around these seas,” he broods on 
“Dumb It Down,” on which fat black 
friend Gemstones and bald white friend 
Graham Burris warn him that the new, 
improved Lupe is “goin’ over niggas heads” 
and recommend he rather “pour champagne 
on a bitch” to round the average hoodrat back 
into his fan club. Which this dude, of course, 
just ain’t havin’.

Fiasco’s new independent streak and role shift 
toward tortured voice-of-the-ghetto have also lent 
a new ferocity to his live show, highly evolved from 
the former self-conscious, open-mic affair in which his 
backup often overshadowed the star. But 
let’s hope Lu doesn’t completely abandon 
the goofy wiggle of his days as Kanye 
Jr. — after all, the last thing we UCSD 
worms need is another excuse to wax 
dark and tortured.

Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist
   

Starring Michael Cera & Kat Dennings
Directed by  Peter Sollett

Rated PG-13

I n last year’s critical and commercial hit, the indie-turned-mainstream “Juno,” Michael Cera warmed the hearts of filmgoers everywhere as an adorably pathetic high school boy forced to deal with the ramifications of 
impregnating his crush. In “Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist,” Cera looks to 

reheat hearts in 2008, this time playing an adorably pathetic high school 
boy forced to deal with the ramifications of making out with a stranger 

and confronting his seductress of an ex-girlfriend. 
It’s nice to see that Cera is finally starting to show some range.

“Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist” proves an easy target within its 
first few scenes: Aside from casting Cera as lead, the film otherwise 

shamelessly exploits the success of “Juno” and her massive cult fol-
lowing. But if we can get past conspicuous similarities, there are 

certainly unique elements to Nick and Norah’s quaint hipster 
romance. Though not nearly as coy, clever nor captivating as 

“Juno,” it gets by on a colorful set of adolescent dramas and 
eccentric characters, like a throwback to the “Brat Pack” 

romantic comedies of the ’80s.

  RESTLESS KIDS WITH CRUSHES
     RUN IN WORN CIRCLES

By Edwin Gonzalez
Associate Hiatus Editor

M aking privy the gilded story of an aristocrat magically endowed with a liberal conscience, Saul Dibb’s adaptation of Amanda Foreman’s best-selling biography limits itself as a period piece, overly reliant on tailored 
costumes and a conventional narrative that lacks any underlying substance. Set in 
a baroque milieu of palatial galas glowing with ornate architecture and ambiance, 
Georgiana Spencer’s neo-classical values contrast with her surroundings and associ-
ates yet fail to inspire the same audacity in her director.

Wedded to the prime investor of the pseudo-progressive Whig Party, “The Duchess” 
follows the bellicose years of marriage between Georgiana (Keira Knightley) and her 
fiendishly curt husband, the famed Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes). Forced to bear the 
burdens and bastard children of her cheating spouse in an era where “rule of thumb” isn’t yet 
an idiom, Georgina manages to maintain her celebrity persona with poise while dabbling in 
gambling and alcohol, with bouts of addiction on the side. Capping off her gloriously contrac-
tual arrangement, she is unable to produce a male heir, which only opens up the marriage to 18th

century Big Love with another woman who potentially can.
Unfortunately, Georgiana’s 21st century incarnate is a saccharin actress who performs her stage 

direction — aghast — in nearly every scene as if she had sad hiccups, her mouth slightly agape and eyes 
on the edge of tearing every time. Throughout the film, Knightley lacks the aplomb and finesse of Cate 
Blanchett or the refined Helen Mirren while altogether void of Kirsten Dunst’s youthful mirth. Dolled up 
in a plethora of buoyant gowns and anglo-headresses, she doesn’t far surpass an anachronistic version of 
herself, fisting brandy instead of beer.

ANTIQUATED ANTICS
BEG A HEFTY DUSTING

To be fair, what else could the A.S. kids have scraped together with their leftover pocket change, having already 
snagged smoothtalker Lupe Fiasco and curly-haired Ben Kweller? 

It is only fitting that the fest’s third slot be reserved for a more 
obscure, albeit danceable, opener. 

Now, if they had a magically expansive budget, A.S. could 
have imported, say, the Dublin deities of U2 or their infinitely 

revered chums, Radiohead. But because such a budget is about 
as likely as a UCSD football team, those billion-dollar bug-

gers won’t soon grace the RIMAC stage (unless Bono takes 
us on as his next charity case). So instead, A.S. filled their 

elusive “other” spot with what they figured was the next 
best thing — babyfaced Britpop wannabes, We Are 

Lions. Hey, you can’t blame ’em for trying. 
But judging from their one-and-only album, 

Eight Arms Made This (get it? Because there are 
four of them?), imitation may prove the worst 

form of flattery, with patently inspired efforts 

quickly buckling to a lukewarm, samesy slog. 
Lead guitarist Atom Whitman’s calculated 

Thom-Yorke strumming is all but lost to his 
sulky, I-hate-you-Mom moans. Piled in slurpy 
lyrical noodles like “Sweetheart, I’m apologetic/ But 
not sorry in the slightest,” it’s hard to appreciate the 
poppy, fast-driven rhythms that ultimately save the 
Lions from a permanent spot in the garage.

But other tracks, like the throbbing “Lovers and 
Fighters” or hormonally squeaky “La Vendetta Dulce” glow 
with the frenzied vibrancy that pushed whiners like Cursive 
or Fall Out Boy onto the bedroom walls of angry pre-teens 
everywhere. Who knows — maybe there’s some appeal to anthe-
mic, off-key repetitions like “Talk talk talk/ What they say/ I’ve got 
got got/ To get away.” Let’s just hope the Hollywood-bred rockers 
won’t convince kids to “get away” before the real cats arrive.

W hen a movie is squeezed from  Chuck Palahniuk’s clotted vein, one expects 
the same tight dialogue and trials of 

human psyche that gave Fight Club 
its cult notoriety. Choke — cen-

tered on a sex-addicted slacker who stumbles 
into love while caring for his institutional-
ized mother — doesn’t disappoint. Clearly, 
the film is inspired by the same dysfunc-
tional world that birthed 1999’s Pitt/Norton 
sensation. Faithful to Palahniuk’s outlandish 
imagination, newcomer director Clark Gregg 
laces potentially heavy-lidded themes with 
lighthearted, often hysterical jabs.

The humor in Choke 
depends mainly on the 
profound sleaze of Victor 
Mancini (Sam Rockwell), 
whose self-deprecating narra-
tion teeter-tots between a vag-
abond past and apathetic pres-

Musically Modern Teen Sex Comedy 
Strums One Too Many Heart Strings

a THE OPENING OF UCSD’S FIRST PERFORMANCE LOUNGE & CLUB PIQUED THE CURIOSITY
OF MANY A CAMPUS-BOUND NIGHT OWL. HERE’S WHAT WENT DOWN:

UCSD is finally starting to figure out fun (one baby step at a time), and the grand open-
ing of multi-purpose venue the Loft on the 
second floor of the new Price Center has 
already gotten so many things right: free (or 
cheap) nightly entertainment, a new 24-hour 
food establishment nearby (even if it is Burger 
King), a bar with beer and wine and a respect-
able showcase for local artwork. But enough 
ArtPower circle jerking — what have their 
efforts truly birthed? 

Let’s start with the vaguely meaning-
less slogan: “Where Emerging Art and Pop 
Culture Collide.” In practice, this equates to 
a stylistic free-for-all, eclectic often to a fault. 

On opening night, modern bluegrass and 
Middle Eastern rock bombarded a crowd still 
sombered by string ensembles Built and The 
Calder Quartet, the random assortment of 
ear-splitting jukebox noise hopping through 
genres without a care in the world — while a 
projection of Kubrick’s classic “2001: A Space 
Odyssey” dragged us through 15 minutes of 
comotose astronauts and a peering robot eye.

With all these isolated stimuli to process, 
most of the club’s apparent aim for lounge 
ambience and sophisticated mod was lost 
to sensory overload. Fortunately, ArtPower’s 
cultural hyperconsciousness eventually paid 
off, as headliner Nortec broke the tension 
with their electro-mariachi wizardry and 

transformed the stiff performance muesum 
into a full-fledged Tijuana nighclub. The trio 
brought their own trippy video accompani-
ment and blew minds with special light-grid 
instruments that pulsated to the beat — all 
while lookin’ mighty sharp in their cowboy 
hats. For a half-hour, I was a Loft believer.

The Loft’s Fall-quarter schedule establish-
es the space as another much-needed avenue 
on campus to keep freshmen out of their lap-
top-lit caverns and give the rest of us a reason 
to stay on campus at all. University Events’ pet 
project is headed in the right direction; now 
all it needs is a map.

T he supposed cousin of Rogue Wave’s drummer stopped me in the Price Center East hallway, needing someone to under-
stand how fucking amazing this band was. I guess he 
had thus far cried to every song — something about the 
Bloc Party-ness of it all, and what he referred to as the 
mind-boggling “melodic tones.” Thanks, Hallway Loser, 
for spelling out for me exactly why I had begun to feel 
nauseous in there.

For night two of the week-long Loft-Off, the variously 
shaped cafeteria tables — a huge contributor to an OVT-
meets-Mandeville feng shui the night before, not to men-
tion a pesky obstacle in achieving complete dance party 
chaos — were cleared out to create more standard concert 
space, though Rogue Wave didn’t inspire much more 
than impassioned swaying. The mop-headed lead singer 
switched on his romantic Shins/Decemberists accent 
to further dramatize a mediocrity-disguising assault of 
“melodic tones,” graciously provided by his rather dopey-
looking band mates (one in a corduroy fishing cap — just 
saying).

At their own loss, most of the crowd trickled out 
behind Rogue Wave, unaware they would miss the Loft’s 
first official case of audience/artist anarchy. As local DJ 
Shark Attack spazzed out to his own top-rate, Timbaland-
heavy club mix, a few especially inspired ladies rushed the 
stage to try their luck at backup dancing (Shark Attack’s 
partner-in-crime had been arrested en route to UCSD, so 
he was looking a little lonely up there). When a Loft stage-
hand politely requested they get the fuck down, Shark 
Attack halted the turntables and refused to continue with-
out his girls — at which point the entire remaining crowd 
joined in revolt and made a stage-exclusive party of it.

The sleek, high-culture intentions of the Loft’s stiff 
wallflower couch, bomb-ass tapas and theatre-intermis-
sion alcohol table are all fine and dandy — but in the end, 
it may take our long-formed instincts to rebel against 
authority a little transition time to fully digest the concept 
of a university-run venue that’s also, like, awesome.

The premise — involving a midnight scav-
enger hunt to find Where’s Fluffy, the film’s 
loveable rock band — is at best arbitrary, 
but glued by the constant and lust-driven 
tension among a circle of awkward adoles-
cents. Throughout the course of the film, 
Nick (Cera) finds himself constantly drawn 
to his utterly shallow but incredibly sexy 
ex-girlfriend Tris (Alexis Dziena), epitomiz-
ing every drooling boy’s fantasy; likewise, 
Norah (Kat Dennings) finds herself constant-
ly at the sleeve of her on-and-off ex-boyfriend 
Tal (Judd Apatow-apostle Jay Baruchel) to 
quell her obvious dependency issues. While 
the sheer sexual magnetism reverberating 
between the guys and gals merits an occas-
sional chuckle, like all romantic comedies, the 
eponymous, panting characters must move 
past uncontrollable urges and recognize the 
ultimate importance of a lasting love.

Admittedly, the film tries a little too hard 
to boast musical credentials, unabashedly 

namedropping several obscure bands and 
even allowing folk-rocker Devendra Banhart 
a self-indulgent cameo, but the film’s celebra-
tion of the inseparability of music and love is 
wholeheartedly endearing, convincing audi-
ences that the question “What kind of music 
do you listen to?” is actually pretty darn 
significant.

Though “Nick and Norah” requires some 
stretching of the imagination — specifically 
with the notion of fate — its fresh twist on 
Romeo and Juliet lets us witness a couple 
of kids falling in love within mere hours of 
meeting, over a shared musical interest. It’s all 
very whimsical and charming, even if some-
what cheesy and unbelievable. 

The film is genuinely funny, mostly due to 
Cera’s predictable, aw-shucks demeanor, and 
Ari Graynor’s performance as the drunkenly 
disobedient Caroline. As far as stereotypical 
romantic comedies go, the film succeeds in 
entertaining — but expecting another “Juno” 
is hopeless.

ent. We get that Victor is fucked 
up from the beginning — the film’s 
opening pan through his Sex Addicts 
Anonymous meeting is soon followed 
by a ravenous bathroom quickie with 
a fellow attendee. Obviously, not quite 
grasping that whole “12-step” thing. 

From the failed therapy session, 
we follow Victor to his job as an 
“indentured Irish servant” in hokey 
colonial America. His stocking-clad 
boss is played by none other than 
director Gregg himself, reprimand-
ing Victor and his best friend Denny 
(Brad William Henke) for chewing 
gum, among other blatantly non-
19th-century behavior. Victor press-
es that he’s not a re-enactor but a 
“historical interpreter” — complete 
with a clip-on ponytail that jiggles as 
he rushes to meet his senile mother 
(Anjelica Huston) at her care home. 

Each time Victor visits her, he 
invents a new personality (as his 
mother can no longer recognize 
him). Her condition is apparently 
worsening, and to pay for hospital 

bills, Victor regularly fakes choking 
in restaurants. When he recruits a  
diner-turned-hero to “rescue” him, 
the poor schmuck believes himself 
to be spiritually bound to Victor and, 
thereafter, mails him monetary ges-
tures of their eternal friendship. You 
gotta give the slimeball credit; he’s 
impressively resourceful.

Life goes on like this — empty 
boning interposed by hopeless hospi-
tal visits — until our antihero meets 
Paige Marshall (Kelly Macdonald), a 
nurse he doesn’t recognize (or rather, 
the only nurse he hasn’t yet slept with). 
Something about the sweet-faced 
woman both baffles and intrigues him. 
Initially rejecting his cocky advances, 
she finally offers herself in the hospi-
tal’s eerie church — to their mutual 
surprise, Victor falls flaccid. 

Their relationship is advanced by 
Victor’s desperate quest to discover 
the identity of his real father before 
his mother crumbles under illness. 

Although marked by sloppy, fade-
to-black transitions, “Choke”’s flash-
backs are just as affecting as its fast-

paced present. Muddied by adven-
tures with his junkie mother, Victor’s 
childhood is effectively stripped of 
normalcy as she maniacally teach-
es him the art of zoo trespassing 
(among other illegal activities), only 
to abandon him for the drug life that 
presumably led to her insanity. But 
through her blatant maternal failings, 
Huston conveys a glimmer of genu-
ine love. For this reason, we share 
Victor’s ache as he helplessly endures 
her slow deterioration.

Though the low-budget adapta-
tion isn’t perfect (the curse of most 
adaptations), its omitted chunks 
and erratically grainy filmwork are 
compensated by truly side-splitting 
moments — Victor’s unsuccessful 
bout with rape-fantasy roleplay, for 
instance, or one particularly memo-
rable farmhouse blowjob — and the 
unexpected ending will likely stun 
even those anticipating Palahniuk’s 
unpredictable cool. Like “Fight Club,” 
“Choke” celebrates the perverse 
human spirit — this time, with a 
smile.

Cold War Kids
■ Loyalty to Loyalty
DOWNTOWN

S ummoned from SoCal obscurity 
by chorusing 
bloggers, Cold 
War Kids met 
avid success on the Web and, later, 
with their debut. Loyalty to Loyalty, the 
band’s sophomoric effort, stamps out 
the Christian undertones of their first 
album for a soapbox that puts the ser-
monic skeleton to better use.

Guitars restrung with Sagittarian 
bowstrings alongside piano chords 
hammered by arthritic hands will ring 
gorgeously familiar for many fans; how-
ever, a hasty miscegenation of sub-rock 
genres often thins the greater good.

Although the album’s second half 
shoots for diversity with swamp-rock, 
saloon-style melodies (“Every Valley Is 
Not A Lake”), opiated tempos on the 
verge of arrest (“Avalanche In B”) and 
the yowling tides of Nathan Willet’s fal-
setto (“Relief”), the band cuts corners 
with a shallow bag of cheap tricks. 

Willett draws vibrato from the 
middle of words — almost as if his 
lyrics were chords — for a narra-
tive plaster-thick with alimony sym-
bolism, metaphors for diminishing 
returns and other figurative middle-
aged concerns.

The album’s bluesy roots give 
Willett’s deafening pleads for atten-
tion the vocal tenor of a traveling 
preacher disguised as a sweaty tramp, 
finding a fascinating self-righteous-
ness under a mess of overintent.

Metallica
■ Death Magnetic 
DOWNTOWN

O n Death Magnetic, the near-
ly forgotten 
grandmasters 
of heavy metal 
return with a vengeance, abandoning 
innovation for the classic bombastic 
instrumentation of their most famous 
and critically acclaimed works from 
the ’80s and early ’90s. While most 
contemporary rock, no matter the sub-
genre, tends to revolve around a catchy, 
sound-bite-ready chorus, Metallica’s 
newest work shifts its emphasis back 
to the seamless interplay of pound-
ing drums and escalating guitar riffs, 
gradually building off each other into 
clashing, thrashing climaxes. Cryptic 
lyrics — which vaguely explore tired 
facets of death and suicide — take a 
backseat to the vastly more entertain-
ing background noise. This fundamen-
tal paradigm shift is most obvious on 
“Suicide and Redemption,” an instru-
mental track clocking in at nearly 10 
minutes that contains such an epic 
synthesis of oscillating riffs and frantic 
drumbeats, you’d hardly believe these 
guys are as old as your dad.

Each track averages roughly 
seven minutes, totaling over an 
hour of heavy, earth-shaking rage 
with minimal lyrics that induce a 
state of absolute listener exhaustion. 
While Metallica’s newfound infatua-
tion with the classic metal that first 
vaulted them to stardom will thrill 
enthusiasts, the average peruser, 
deafened from awareness of intricate 
shifts separating one jaw-dropping 
guitar solo from another, will inevi-
tably be overwhelmed by unpleasant 
sameness — let’s just say Magnetic 
certainly won’t win Metallica any 
new converts. The perpetual discon-
nect between those who feel that 
Metallica’s powerful concoctions 
speak to the soul and those who dis-
miss their music as senseless noise 
won’t be resolved anytime soon.

For all its “polite” dialogue and 
passive-aggressive, pretty-English dis-
course, Dibb’s style of directing doesn’t 
know the meaning of subtlety, repeat-
edly beating the audience with plot 
development by holding an image for 
five long seconds or zooming until one 
object fills the entire screen, in case we 
had any doubts about what we were 
supposed to be looking at.

Shooting in 1940s melodramatic 
form, he fills his narrative not only 
with heavy-handed storytelling but 
cookie-cutter arthouse filmmaking: 
pastoral panning, abundant sym-
metrical compositions and interior 
scenes framed by windows, doors and 

any other rectangular object in the 
room. Pacing is slow to moderate and 
although his craftsmanship isn’t poor, 
Dibb often resorts to faux artistry and 
imitation techniques.

Comparisons to Sofia Coppola’s 
2006 number about the blue-blooded 
Marie Antoinette will undoubtedly sur-
face, yet two things chiefly differ. 

While “Antoinette” didn’t suffer 
from the same aesthetic deficit, her 
heroine never found the political outlet 
Spencer’s does. If indeed Spencer is a 
more precise precursor to the mod-
ern woman, battered by inequalities 
and defined by her gender role, then 
she aptly dissents through her political 
involvement.

same Josh Beckett that demolished 
opponents in the postseason last year. 
Beckett is 12-10 with a 4.03 ERA this 
season compared to 20-7 with a 3.27 
ERA in 2007. Yes, the Red Sox are 
the defending champions. Yes, the Red 
Sox swept the Angels in the ALDS last 
season and in 2004. Yeah, Josh Beckett 
is historically a beast in the postseason. 
But if anyone knows that history can’t 
be trusted in the playoffs, it’s Boston. 
Looking at 2008 alone, the Angels have 
won eight of nine games in the season 
series and Beckett has looked mortal. I 
say the Angels bounce back from the 
loss in game one, using their revamped 
offense from the Teixeira trade to at 
least keep the series interesting.

Cubs vs. Dodgers
That was a good old-fashioned 

thrashing that the Dodgers handed to 
the Cubs last night. Are the cubbies 
cursed forever? I’m going to go with 
yes. OK, I know that I just talked about 
how history can’t be trusted in the 
playoffs but the Cubs are in a different 
league. They put in Ryan Dempster, 
who went 14-3 with a 2.86 ERA in 

home starts this season and 1-0 with 
a 2.92 ERA in two starts against the 
Dodgers this season and he was hit 
for four runs in 4.2 innings of work in 
game one. Offensively, the Cubbies had 
no answer for the Dodgers after the 
second inning, and their one and two 
hitters went a combined 0-9. The Cubs, 
who are the trendy pick to win the 
World Series, will give the start tonight 
to Carlos Zambrano, who is always 
good for a surprise crappy start (eight 
runs in 1.2 innings on Sept. 19 in St. 
Louis!) and a dugout temper tantrum. 
One-third of the ESPN experts picked 
the Cubs to win it all and no one can 
argue that the Chicago’s a great team, 
but as their first game this postseason 
illustrated, there are a lot of question 
marks.  

Every year, the start of the MLB 
playoffs is exciting for fans all over the 
country. This season, with an even mix 
of postseason-regulars and postseason-
newbies, the playoffs have just a little 
more for everyone.

rounds respectively to finish at 34 
over par as a team. 

Samra improved on his 11th-
place finish at Western Washington 
with a ninth-place finish at the 
NCAA Preview Tournament. He 
fired rounds of 71-73-70 to finish 
one over par for the tournament, 
nine strokes behind the winner. 
Samara said the team has made his 
transition easy.

“It’s just golf,” he said. “The team 
and guys have made the transition

Despite the poor appearance of a 
13th-place finish, the Tritons were 
pitted against the best of Division-
II men’s golf and were able to finish 
in the middle of the pack this early 
in the season.

“I think this weekend instilled 
confidence,” Bailey said. “We’re 
not satisfied, but we were play-

blown out. People know who we are 
and even fear us a bit.”

The men will trek home now

The defense has been stalwart 
thus far, led by Akman and sopho-
more defender Jared Kukura, who 
was named the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association men’s player 
of the week for 
the week ending 
Sept. 28.

The three 
goals allowed 
against the 
Coyotes equaled 
the entire total 
on the season 
going into the 
match.

“We did 
not work very 
well as a group 
on offense and 
defense and we 
got really spread out,” Fernandez 
said. “In practice this week we 
really worked on positioning and 
where we are relative to the person 
in front and behind us.”

Head coach John Pascale agreed 
that it was time for his team to work 
on some fundamentals in training, 
especially on the defensive end, 
where the Tritons were challenged 
during their last game. 

“We made a lot of mistakes and 
this week we really got back to 
basics,” Pascale said. “We did indi-
vidual and small group defending, 

just trying to get organized again.”
The Tritons will need to be 

more than organized as they host 
CCAA powerhouse Sonoma State 
University on Oct. 3. With an over-
all record of 8-1-2, the Seawolves 
are currently ranked No. 1 in the 
Division-II NSCAA/Adidas West 
Regional Rankings and No. 4 in 
the nation. 

The Tritons have experience in 
big games like these, earning a hard 
fought 0-0 tie with then-No. 4 Cal 

State Dominguez 
two weeks ago. 
Sonoma State 
certainly poses 
a stiff test for 
UCSD, but it is 
one the Tritons 
believe they are 
ready for.

“The mindset 
of the team is ‘let’s 
beat Sonoma,’” 
Pascale said. “We 
have a chance to 
knock off one of 
the best teams in 

the nation at home on Friday.”
Fernandez said the seesaw of 

emotions created by the results of 
the last two matches has done lit-
tle to change the mentality of the 
squad as they head into this impor-
tant match.

“We have the same mental-
ity that we had in preseason,” 
Fernandez said. “We just come into 
practice every day and work hard 
— the same as day one.”

HOT CORNER

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 2, 2008

By Matt Croskey
Senior Staff Writer

MEN’S GOLF — The Tritons opened 
up their 2008-09 campaign against 
tough opponents on the road at 
two prestigious Division-II tour-
naments, finishing seventh at the 
Western Washington Invitational 
and tying for 13th at the NCAA 
Division-II Preview Tournament. 
UCSD finished 27 strokes behind 
winning team University of Central 
Oklahoma.

“We always go to the Western 
Washington Invitational so attend-
ing the NCAA Preview was getting 
a two-for-one,” said Mike Wydra, 
who is in his 30th season as the 
Tritons’ head coach. “Additionally, 
a team’s NCAA rank is not only 
what you shoot but your strength of 
schedule. It also gave us an oppor-
tunity to see the course where the 
National Championship will be 
held.”

Returning three seniors and two 
juniors, the Tritons are looking 
to improve upon last year’s per-
formance. The addition of junior 
transfer student Raj Samra, who 
according Wydra was a top recruit 
out of community college, has real-
ly altered the team’s chemistry in 
a good way. Samra has shown the 
team a strong commitment to the 
game, something which has been 
lacking, according to senior Ryan 
Bailey.

“We’re really rallying behind 
[Samra],” he said. “Usually there 

is a learning curve for freshman 
but [Samra] already has collegiate 
experience and that has helped.”

Samra and the team got their 
first taste of competition at the 
Western Washington Invitational 
Sept. 26-27. Its seventh-place finish 
improved on the team’s 10th-place 
finish from last season.

The Tritons opened with a 
10-over 298 on day one, 20 shots 
behind No. 12 Sonoma State, which 
turned in a team total of 10-under 
278. Sophomore Keith Okasaki led 
the way for UCSD, shooting an 
even-par 72. Bailey carded a two-
over 74.

On day two, the Triton golfers 
fared better, scoring a four-under 
284 to finish the tournament six-
over par as a team. Individually, 
Samra turned in the second lowest 
round of the day, a four-under 68. 
Samra finished in a tie for 17th 
with teammate senior Billy Olsen. 

Okasaki was the low-man for the 
Tritons, carding an even-par 72 in 
the final round and finished even 
par for the tournament.

The Triton golfers hung around 
in Washington for a few more days 
to take part in the NCAA Division-
II Preview Tournament for the first 
time. Held at Loomis Trail Country 
Club, UCSD faced a much stiffer 
test than what it saw in the Western 
Washington Invitational.

Set up to play just under 7,000 
yards and par 71, Loomis Trail was 
a different beast than what players 
had faced only two days earlier, 
Wydra said.

“Imagine running through the 
Colosseum in ancient Rome,” he 
said. “You get through once, the 
odds of getting back through aren’t 
very good. The course had water on 
18 holes. That’s all of them.”

Fresh faces Samra and Okasaki 
led UCSD, firing an even-par 71 

and three-over 74 respectively. 
Their scores put the Tritons in a tie 
for 13th, the same place in which 
they’d finish the tournament.

The Tritons faced one of the 
most difficult challenges of tourna-
ment golf as they played a grueling 
36 holes in one day. While the 
physical toll may not be as tough as 
a basketball team who plays three 
games in a day, the mental toll is 
what wears players out.

“It’s part of collegiate golf,” 
Wydra said. “Our mental tough-
ness is one of our biggest assets as a 
team. The addition of [Samra] has 
also improved our mental game 
with his no-fear clarity infecting 
the whole team.”

UCSD proved that it was up 
for the task improving with each 
round. Building on their day-one 
299 total, the Tritons carded a 295 

As everyone knows, the Major League Baseball Playoffs start-ed yesterday and since it would 
be cheating to make first-round predic-
tions after the postseason has started, 
let’s just call these my thoughts and 
observations on the division matchups.

Phillies vs. Brewers
This is officially the feel-good series 

of the playoffs. The Phillies hadn’t won 
a playoff game since 1993 until yes-
terday and, by making the postseason 
this season, the Brew-Crew ended the 

longest active playoff drought in pro-
fessional sports. Unfortunately for all 
those still celebrating in Wisconsin, 
the Brewers’ run is over. The Phillies 
have now won 14 of their last 18 games 
and, in a five-game series, momen-
tum is everything. It’s also hard to bet 
against Ryan Howard, Chase Utley and 
Jimmy Rollins, who have destroyed 
Brewers’ pitching this season. The fact 
that Philadelphia has Brad Lidge hold-
ing down the bullpen can’t hurt either. 
Seriously though, Brewers fans can be 
happy that their team finally made the 
playoffs and Phillies fans can be happy 
that they finally won a playoff game 
because neither of these teams can 
stand up to the Cubs or the Dodgers so 
that’s all they’re going to get for awhile. 

Rays vs. White Sox
How reassuring is it when your own 

manager is asking, “How the fuck did 
we get here?” Despite Ozzie’s assess-
ment, you have to give the White Sox 
their due credit. They earned their way 
into the playoffs, winning their last 
three games, including a tiebreaker 
over the Twins, to sneak into the post-
season. Still, the White Sox did let go of 
their previous five games, which cost 
them the lead in the American League 
Central and forced them to play in a 
one-day playoff. Wait, how the hell 
did the White Sox get here again? For 
the first time during Ozzie’s reign over 
the White Sox I actually understand 
and agree with his assessment of the 
situation. 

While the White Sox have been busy 
losing their lead and gaining it back in 
exciting fashion, the Rays have had a 
spot in the playoffs for over 10 days 
and have pretty much been a lock for 
the postseason for awhile. With post-
season games generally coming down 
to the wire, Chicago’s bullpen is a real 
problem. Over the last three months of 
the season, the White Sox relievers have 
had an ERA over 5.00. The scrappy 
Rays are bound to take advantage of 
that weakness and use their home-field 
advantage to take the series.  

Angels vs. Red Sox
With the 4-1 loss to Boston last 

night, the Angels have now lost 10 
straight games to the Red Sox. Still, I 
wouldn’t be too quick to write them 
off. The Angels and Red Sox are both 
strong teams, no doubt. The Red Sox 
took the victory in game one thanks 
to Jason Bay’s bomb (how awesome is 
it to see Bay finally in the playoffs?), 
but this series is far from over. First 
of all, Josh Beckett in 2008 is not the

Tritons Shut Out at Home

By Brent Westcott
Staff Writer

MEN’S SOCCER — Over the course 
of a long, challenging collegiate 
athletic season, it is almost inevita-
ble that there will be extreme highs 
and lows. The UCSD men’s soc-
cer team learned this lesson well 
on Sept. 28 after suffering a 3-0 
thrashing at the hands of Cal State 
San Bernardino at Triton Soccer 
Field. 

The Tritons, in the midst of a 
four-game home stand, were com-
ing away from one of their most 
impressive victories of the year after 
scoring a three-goal win against 
Cal Poly Pomona on Sept. 26, but 
momentum proved to be a strange 
and fickle beast. After impressively 
winning their first five games of the 
season, the Tritons have dropped 
two of their last three.

The squad started the match off 
looking sluggish and the Coyotes 
took full advantage, netting two 
scores before the 20-minute mark 
of the first half. In the 11th min-
ute, the Coyotes were able to put 
together a quick counterattack after 
winning the ball at midfield, result-
ing in a goal by forward Jorge 
Aguirre. Aguirre benefited from 
a well-played cross by midfielder 
Miguel Alatorre. 

The goal put UCSD down one 

early and the Coyotes showed lit-
tle sign of letting up. Only three 
minutes later, forward Obi Agwu 
threaded a pass to midfielder Brock 
Steele, who buried his chance in the 
back of the net for the second goal 
of the day. 

Rather than roll over after 
going down by two scores early, 
the Tritons turned the energy on, 
showing the intensity and focus the 
team has displayed all season long. 
UCSD picked up the physical play 
and did a better job creating chanc-
es, but the Coyotes proved to be the 
better, putting their third and final 
goal through in the 36th minute of 
the first half. Alatorre was awarded 
a penalty kick as both he and senior 
goalkeeper Peter Akman fought for 
a ball played into the box. The ref-
eree charged Akman with a yellow 
card for interfering on the play and 
UCSD’s goalkeeper could not stop 
Alatorre’s ensuing penalty kick. 

The Tritons picked up their play 
in the second half but missed per-
haps their best scoring chance dur-
ing the 61st minute of the match. 
Sophomore midfielder Aaron 
McDowell played a beautiful ball 
into the box off a corner kick, and 
senior forward Tony Fernandez 
nearly headed the ball past the 
Coyote goalkeeper. Chances were 
limited for both teams after that, 
and the Coyotes prevailed with 
a tough road victory. The loss 
dropped the Tritons’ record to 3-2-
1 in California Collegiate Athletic 
Association play and 6-2-1 overall. 
The team currently stands in a tie 
for third place with 10 points in the KAREN LING/GUARDIAN

UCSD’s offense has struggled over the last four games, getting shut out three times. The Tritons are 
3-2 in league play, which puts them in a tie for third in the south division with a total of 10 points.

The men’s soccer team 
falls to 6-2-1 after Cal 
State San Bernardino 
deals UCSD a 3-0 home 
loss on Sept. 28.
