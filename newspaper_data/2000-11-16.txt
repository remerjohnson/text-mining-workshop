Peace Vigil Unites Students 
Ceremony comes in 
response to cease in 
peace talks 

Contributing News Writer 

In response to the recent dete-
rioration of peace talks in the Mid-
dle East, a candlelight vigil for 
peace was held at the Price Center 
Monday night. 

The vigil was the first event of 
its kind sponsored by the San 
Diego Visual Peace Action Com-
mittee. 

"The purpose of this vi~il is 
two-fold: said Diego ChoJkier, 
founder and head of SANDlPAC. 
"We want to stop the negative atti-
tudes here on campus toward the 
conflict in Israel, and we want to 
gear people's minds toward peace 
there: 

The vigil primarily concenlJ'at-
ed on Christians, Jews and Mus-
lims, the three major religious 
groups involved in the Mid-East 
struggle, although people of every 
religious affiliation were invited to 
attend. 

Participants met at Muir college 
and were given candles to light and 
be carried on a procession through 
campus. 

Upon arrival at the Price Cen-
ter, Chojkier said a few opening 
words. Students and others were 
then invited to speak their minds 
on the conflict in Israel, but were 
asked to omit any personal sugges-
tions for a solution. 

Father Cassian Lewinski, a 
priest from the UCSD Catholic 
Community and currently in his 
third year on campus, led the 
speakers with a prayer for peace in 
the Middle East. During the vigil, 
he simplified the focus of the 
evening. 

"We're just here to show our 
suppon for peacc," he said. 

Rabbi Lisa Goldstein, a repre-
sentative from Hillel, the founda-
tion for Jewish campus life, also led 
a prayer, this time for peace all over

the world. She also reflected upon 
the impact of the Middle East's sit-
uation on UCSD. 

"There's been anger on campus 
at what's happening [in the Middle 
East) an~ people have been venting 
it toward each other," Goldstein 
said. "It's important to understand 
'that what happens there happens 

there. but here is our own world. 
We don't need to involve ourselves 
in the politics of the Middle East 
struggle; we just need to share in 
the pain of it."

UPTE 
Asks For 
Sanction 
UCSD union says it 
might strike 
By VINCENT GRAGNANI 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD technical employees 
have taken the first steps toward 
authorizing a strike. 

The University Professional 
and Technical Employees voted 
to request a strike sanction from 
the San Diego Labor Council, the 
union announced last week, 

After months of bargaining, 
the union said it still lacks a fair 
contract with the University of 
California, 

"We're upset because our pay 
rates are not up to par with out-
side companies," said Carolan 
Buckmaster, president of San 
Diego's UPTE division. "People 
are leaving in droves." 

Michael Melman, 
employee/labor relations director 
at UCSD, said the problems are 
and should be worked out at the 
bargaining table. 

"The university conducts 
negotiations in good faith with all 
of its labor unions: he said. "The 
university is interested in reach-
ing settlements promptly. 

Buckmaster said the high 
turnover of university technical 
employees could diminish the 
quality of research at UCSD, 

"I don't see how the university 
can keep its status with an ever-
increasing turnover of research 
staff," she said. "This is one of our 
major concerns." 

She added that the vote does 
not necessarily ' mean the union 
will strike. If the union decides to 
strike, she said it could take place 
as soon as three weeks from now. 

Buckmaster said that while a 
strike would not affect most stu-

. dents, it may affect some with lab 
classes that require a technician. 

Athletes Plea for Student Referendum Funds 
New Legislation Disc~ssed at Fourth Meeting that Could Raise Student Fees over $230 
ContrlbtltitW News Writer 

Students and faculty of the 
Campus Life Referendum Com-
mittee held their founh meeting in 
a series to discuss the proposal of 
a new campus legislation that 
could cost each student over $230 
a year. 

Student athletes filled the 
meeting on Monday to show sup-
pon for the referendum. The pro-
posed referendum will increase 
funds for the UCSD athletic pro-
grams and other student organiza-
tions and facilities. 

Members from track and field, 
women's volleyball, baseball and 
softball teams addressed the com-
mittee about their need for sup-
port in funds. 

"The increased funds will not 
be to expand the athletic pro-
grams, but to merely maintain the 
programs at the current size." said 
traCK and field athlete Matt 
Deford. "The athletic program is a 
representative of the school as a 
whole." 

Baseball team representative 
Chad Addison warned those in 
attendance of the dismal future of 
UCSD sports without the neces-

sary funds, 
"Without this referendum, we 

will have to cut the athletic pro-
grams from 23 to 21 or 19," Addi-
son said. "This will give an 
unequal experience to the incom-
ing freshmen." . , 

According to Addison, the ref-
erendum benefits all students .as 
well as those affiliated with Divi-
sion II athletics. . 

"When I work out in RIMAC, I 
see all students, not just athletes; 
Addison said. "RIMAC facilities 
will be improved, as well as more 
funds for intramural sports." 

Student athletes also highlight-

ed the recent advance to the 
NCAA Division \I status. Senior 
volleyball player Leslie Penalie 
cited increasing school spirit as a 
reason for the legislation. 

"Eighty petcent of the students 
voted to move this school into 
Division II," Punelli said, "This 
referendum is needed to bring 
national championships to 
UCSD." 

Along with the proposed funds 
for the athletics department, the 
proposed referendum will increase 
funds for the Women's Center,

Amnesty International Participates in 
Campaign Against Torture 

VIgil: 
No Islamic group 
attended the event 
ConIhwed ...... INIP 1 

UCSD Chapter of the organization has many events planned to fight international 
injustice in two-year endeavor which started in October ' 

received by those who attended. 
"We are all in the midst of our 

own lives in school; student Kelly 
Seal said. "But there is life outside of 
school. An event like this one puts 
many things into perspective, and 
people start to realize that the suffer-
mg [in the Middle East] won't stop 
until we address it." 

.., IIAIIUBI O'NIILL 
Contributint News Writer 

Amnesty International, 
UCSD's chapter included, 
launched the Campaign Against 
Torture on Oct. 18. 

Amnesty International was 
founded at UCSD in 1988 and 
works to raise awareness about 
human rights issues on campus 
and in the community. [t also 
instigates campaigns fighting 
~gainst human rights and political 

- Issues through activities such as 
letter writing. lectures. films and 
concerts. 

The organization-wide goals 
for the Campaign Against Torture 
are to undertake .special joint-
action strategies in 21 countries to 

Fee: 
If fee does not pass, 
programs must face cuts 
Lesbian , Gay, Bisexual and Thans-
gender Resource Office, Cross Cul-
tural Center, the sixth and seventh 
COlleges, various student govern-
ment groups and organizations, 
university events, and study -

fight against torture ' and ill treat-
ment, to require torturers to be 
held accountable for their actions 
and be brousht to justice in their 
own countries or elsewhere, to 
encourage training for police and 
security forces in proper, humane 
intcJTogation techniques, to end 
the global trade of torture equip-
ment. to confront violence against 
women that falls under the head-
ing of torture, to lobby for the 
United Nations to take action 
against torture at the World Con-
ference on Racism, to expose and 
end torture inflicted on children, 
and to challenge governments to 
implement the U.N. Convention 
Against Torture. 

UCSD's chapter plans to take 
action to support the campaign 

lounges. 
Funds would be allotted to fur-

ther expand the Price Center to 
counteract the school's strong 
undergraduate growth. 

The Grove Cafe is also set to 
bring in new seating through this 
referendum. 

[f passed, the proposed refer-
endum would raise the costs of 
student fees by $67.96 per quar-
ter., If the referendum is not 
passed, all student programs will 

over the course of the next two 
years. Events have so far included 
a joint press conference at Border 
Field State Park, organized by 
chapters of Amnesty in San Diego 
and Tijuana. 

After the press conferenc~, an 
artist reception in Tijuana 
unveiled an exhibit of paintings by 
women painters of the area done 
especially for the campaign. 

Amnesty at UCSD is currentiy 
attempting to have these paintings 
shown again on campus, and to 
have the UCSD Art Gallery feature 
a 'Series of photographs docu-
menting crimes of human rights 
during the regime of Chilean dic-
tator Agusto Pinochet. 

The gallery normally books 
exhibits over a year and a half in 

be forced to take cuts in their 
budget. 

The Campus Life Referendum 
Committee is currentiy working to 
hash out the logistics of the refer-
endum itself. A.S. representative 
Lana Kreidie spoke to help the 
committee in drafting its final ref-
erendum. Krcidie urge~ the com-
mittee to "think critically when 
transitioning from the planning of 
the referendum to the implementa-
tion: 

advance, but this exhibit may find 
a place if another falls through. 

[n addition, Amnesty at UCSD 
is aiming to have one speaker per 
quarter throughout the campaign. 

Possible speakers include pro-
fessors from UCSD, the Universi-
ty of San Diego and San Diego 
State University, or individuals 
from organizations such as the 
San Diego-based Survivors of Tor-
ture [nternational, which provides 
medical and psychological assis-
tance for survivors of torture 
worldwide. The organization can 
be contacted at (619) 582-9018. 

Dec. 10 will be a day to focus 
on Children and Torture, and 
March 8, International Women's 
Day, will have an emphasis on 
women and torture. 

Kreidie emphasized the impor-
tance of the study lounges and new 
places where students and faculty 
can work side-by-side. 

Splinter debates were triggered 
during the public input period. 
A.S. Vice President External 
Eugene Mahmoud addressed the 
group, saying that the UC Board 
of Regents should increase its 
economic support for student 
affairs. . 

Mahmoud told the committee 

No [slamic group attended the 
vigil. 

"I'm disappointed that not all 
communities were represented 
tonight: senior Rachel Fleiner said. 
"It would have been a significant 
statement if some of the Arab com-
munity had shown up, but then 
again, it might have created more 
tension." 

Chojkier seemed pleased .and 
spoke with confidence about the 
vigil. 

"I'm happy people committed to 
the cause, and the speakers spoke 
really well; Chojkier said. 'This 
event will definitely be a springboard 

that students were meeting on 
Wednesday and Thursday at the 
regents meeting at UCLA to ask for 
an increase of student funds from 
the present $6 million to $30 mil-
lion. These amounts would be 
divided equally among the respec-
tive UC schools. 

Assuming the committee comes 
to an agreement on the legislation, 
the UCSD referendum will be put 
to an all-campus vote during Win-
ter 2001 .

Convenient Trolley 
Stops Will Benefit 
UCSD Community 

Everyone says public transportation is 
great, but few at UCSD actually use it, 
mainly because it is not convenient enough. 

Last Thursday, the Metropolitan Transit 
Development Board of San Diego met with 
campus representatives to discuss possible 
locations for trolley stops at UCSD. 

We believe one or more trolley stops on 
campus, as part of the Mid-Coast Corridor 
Alignment, have the potential to be invalu-
able transportation resources, provided they 
are located conveniently enough for people 
to actually use them. 

For this reason, we cannot support any 
plan that would not include a stop near what 
is now central campus, the area surrounding 
the Price Center and Library Walk. 

A trolley stop at this location would be 
especially convenient for the faculty and 
undergraduate population living off cam-
pus, as it would be close to the major lecture 
halls in all five - soon to be six - colleges. 

Several of the proposed plans would 
include a stop at the VA Medical Center 
instead of central campus. Although this 
stop would be significantly closer to central 
campus than the East campus options, it is 
still not close enough. A walk from there to 
Peterson Hall, Warren Lecture Hall or the 
new Eleanor Roosevelt campus would be 
too long for many students and faculty even 
to consider using the trolley. 

The Guardian does feel that a stop in East 
campus would be of great use for those of 
the UCSD community who have business 
on that side of campus, but we feel that any 
stop in that area, or any other, must be in 
addition to a stop in central campus. 

A stop ,in East campus alone would force 
many people to take shuttles to central 
campus, which would be less convenient 
than just parking a car in East Parking and 
taking a shuttle to central campus. Waiting 
for a trolley to get to East campus, then 
waiting for a shuttle to get to the Price Cen-
ter, is just too much waiting for most of us. 

We at the Guardian understand the finan-
cial burden of constructing a stop in central 
campus may be heavy, considering the 
amount of development surrounding it. 
However, we also know that it would be a 
total waste of money if the trolley were not 
used. 

The Guardian editorial board supports all 
forms of alternative transportation that 
wo~d save t~e UCSD community money, 

a~lev~te the unpacted on-campus parking 
SituatiOn, and reduce traffic and pollution in 
the area. 

However, we do not believe these needs 
will be sufficiently served by the trolley 
without a convenient and centrally located 
stop that serves the students as well as the 
rest of the UCSD community.

The United States' Misuse of Energy 
Poses Serious Environmental Threats 

Our rapid consumption of ene(gy poses serious consequences to the 
environment, negativ~ly affecting generations to come

part a consequence of oil drilling. They 
even showed us alleged pictures of the 
Alaskan forests, as if it weren't easy to 
take a picture of any forest in, say, New 
Mexico and put it in the background of 
a photograph of AncJtoraae. 

If forests were so common in Alaska 
only 300 yean ago, how come 
rtKarChcn of the Chrysler University 
and the Exxon University consistently 
failed to find evidence of their existence? 

Evidently, the liberal, public universi-
ties have a hidden agenda. They should 
stop relying on legends like that of the 
mythical sunny weather of San Diego 

One day, out of the blue, a temporal 
wormhole appeared on my balcony from 
which, every now and then, I receive 
thjngs from the future. Some of them 
arc rather unap~ling and, in any case, 
I have been VIvidly and convincingly 
invited by the government not to tell you 
anything about them. But, occasionally, 
so!!'cthing interesting comes up, like 
thIS column from the fall 2350 issue of 
the Guarditm that I am happy to share 
with you. It is, of all things. about the 
energy ~s!s. 

Here It IS: The eneTi ..• d

a position against the death penalty for envtronmen nges. 

parki~g vio\ation~ by illegal immigrants, 
Ignonng how senous the parking prob-
lem in San Diego has become), two or 
three opinion columns in the Guarditm 
in past months tried to make the follow-
ing points: 1.) The energy crisis is 
caused mainly by the fact that America 
alone is using up 80 percent of the 
world's oil supply, and that consumpti.on 
is increasing, and 2.) This increase has 
already caused serious environmental 
changes, and many more will arise in the 
future. . 

The old mantra of environmental 
damages is recited by resource less liber-
als every time progress is threatening 
their ·comfortable cocoon, a mantra that 
is usually dotted with lies. Rtsearch car-
ried out at the traditionally liberal public 
univcnities, for instance, has recently 
tried to convinoc us that 300 yean ago, 
Alaska was covered with forests, and the 
destruction of these forests was in large 

centuries ago, or the even more mythical 
ancient neighborhood named "acific 
Beach on the site of the current Pacific 
Beach bay. 

Stop relying on fantasies. and look at 
the hard figures, like those released last 
week from the Ford research institute: 
There is simply no evidence that harm-
ful environmental cft'ects have occurred 
in the past or are occun:ing now as a 
result of oil consumption. 

I don't care if the socialist Europeans 
are using electric can and public trans-
portation: I am an American, and if I 
want to buy a new eight-wheel-drive 
Ford Exaggerate just to go from home to 
work, I have the right to do so, and no 
whining about energy or the environ-
ment is going to change my mind. 

If we ncccI more oil, we Ihoulcl con-
tinue the successful nco-colonial policy 
of the last two centuries: let's just bomb 

another middle-eas.ern country, and use 
its oil. What we need is more money for 
the military (which, since military 
spending dropped to 92 percent of the 
federal spending, is woefully under-
equipped and unprepared), not more 
money for useless alternative $.OW'CCS 
research. 

If liberals are so worried about oil 
consumption, why did they fight so hard 
against the constitutional amendment 
that required proof of citizenship for 
buying a car that was passed half a cen-
tury ago? 

Most of the environmentalist ideas 
are the anachronistic remains of a long-
gone era, and these liberals should adapt 
to the realities of the new economy. I 
have heard a group say, for instance. that 
we could save a lot .of energy if houses 
and workplaces had windows, thereby 
dramaticaflyrtducing the need for air 
conditioning. For those not familiar with 
the concept: In the old days. windows 
were holes covered with JIass drilled in 
the walls of most buildings. Windows 
could have been a good idea 200 years 
ago, before the introduction of the effec-
tive-time work week. 

. But now, windows would only be a 
way of distracting workcn on the joh 
Distractions that, being revealed by their 
thought-monitoring skull implant, 
would cost workers dear mongo at the 
end of the month. 

Or, listen to this one from one of last 
week's anicles: "These days, most resi-
dentialapartrnents prohibit clotheslines, 

~CDrcin~ l;heir resid~nts to use drycn that, 
m addition to bemg energy inefficient, 
are very harmful for your clothes." 
. This statement shows a complete 
Ignorance of our basic social and eco-
~omic principles. Socially, this country 
IS based on individualism, and that 
makes it absolutely necessary that all 
the apartments in our residential areas 
will look good and, most importantly, 
all the same. What will happen if we

Misconception of Free Speech is Rampant 
Hypocrisy of lopen-minded' liberals irritates author 

Spellk Up, 
Spealt Out! 

PARISA BAHARIAN 

I'm right, therefore you're 
wrong. Does that sound at all 
familiar? 

Or maybe you've had people 
get up in your face, yell and curse 
at you because your beliefs are dif-
ferent from theirs? 

Unfortunately, I have had the 
wonderful opportunity to experi-
ence this abuse firsthand. In the 
days leading up to and following 
the election, people who claimed to 
be open-minded verbally attacked 
some of my friends and myself 
when we professed our views. 

It was almost funny (if you dis-
count the anger and hate that 
were directed at us) how fast their 
proclaimed open-mindedness dis-
appeared when confronted with 
our differing beliefs. 

Either we were confronted 
with !I frosty silence and pointedly 
ignored, or we were angrily lam-
basted about how stupid we were. 
It got to the point where I could-
n't even say who I wanted for 
president because a fight might 
ensue. There were five or six angry 
so-called liberal-minded people, 
and there was no way I could win 
just by my little lonesome self. 

1 am so sick and tired of these 
obviously closed-minded people 
who believe in the right to frie 
speech just as long as it only applies 
to them. These so-called liberal 

thinkers are no bener than bigots. 
Don't tell me that I am wrong. 

Don't curse at me for what I 
believe. I have the right to think 
and form my own opinions just as 
everyone else does. . 

Though this superiority of 
beliefs phenomenon, which I des-
ignate the Right Complex, has 
shown its colors in this very hotly 
contested election, it most defi-
nitely is not limited to it. 

In fact, this Right Complex 
phenomenon has been hitting me 

I am so sick and tired of 
these obviously closed-
minded people who 
believe in the right to 
free speech just as long 
as it onry applies to 
them. -

since the beginning of the quarter. 
For instance, in some of my class-
es, my teaching assistants make 
their views known in such a way 
that if there is a contrary opinion, 
the stude.nt will be trounced and 
made a spectacle in class. 

Or better yet, in a political sci-
ence.class, two guys told me that [ 
was "full of shit" over and over 
when I good-naturedly attempted 
to point out that there was anoth-
er way to look at a particular issue. 
The hateful views of my two fel-
low students stunned me. What 
right did they have to verbally 

harass me just be9luse I didn't 
share their ideology? 

I won't stand for these people's 
hypocrisy anymore. I have the 
right to my opinion, period. And 
in return, I must respect every-
one's opinion. I don't have the 
right to verbally attack someone 
because of a differing belief. I 
don't have the right to make 
someone so uncomfortable that 
they won't even open their mouth 
for fear of being verbally harassed. 

It's actually a very simple con-
cept. It's about respecting others 
even though you might not agree 
with them. I have the right to my 
opinion as long as I don't infringe 
upon another's freedom to have a 
different view. 

If everyone were meant to 
think all the same way, then we 
would have all been made exactly 
the same. But we have all grown 
up with different experiences and 
those experiences are what have 
shaped and molded the beliefs we 
hold today. So who is to judge 
one's experiences and beliefs are 
more valid than others? 

My question to those who 
stand in judgment of others is 
this: Who appointed you God? 
What gives you the right to sit on 
your mighty throne and look 
down upon and verbally attack 
those who do not agree with you? 
What makes your opinions auto-
matically right and all those who 
disagree wrong? 

I have come to realize that our 
society is not one that accepts dif-
fering viewpoints. Instead, it is a

OPINION 5 

Students' Reputation as 
Nerds is ill-Founded 
Many students love partying even though 
UCSD administrators suggest othetwise 

Contributing Opinion Writer 

It's eighth week. Do you know 
where your parties are? 

Odds are you still don't, 
because UCSD's reputation as a 
nerd school has got you discour-
aged and disenchanted, so for Fri-
day night excitement, you throw 
down a bonle of Jack D. in your 
dorm room and read the Guardian. 
This is where I come in. 

After a few years of close 
scrutiny, 1 have come to the con-
clusion that most UCSD students 
are not as academically driven as 
the Greekfreaks would have us 
think. Many, in fact, are just itch-
ing to ditch those TI-92s and bust 
loose a few differential equations 
on the geometric plane of the 
dance floor ... or better yet, the 
topology of your naked body. It's 
not lack of mstinct that restrains 
us, it's lack of information. 

The resident advisers. housing 
advisers and the PD go to great 
lengths to educate us about the 
risks of partying, of going to TJ, of 
unprotected sex at the annual 
Darkstar Halloween Orgy, and 
well they should. Such joyous 
activities cannot be enjoyed with-
out serious hazards to one's 
health. Rarely, however, does any-
one chime in to give the skinny on 
how to have good, illicit, or explic-
it fun - and .get away 
with it. Like I said before, this is 
where I come in. 

Without further ado, here's my 
exhaustive guide to the art of par-

tygoing. 
Going to a party is like going 

out into the field in 'Nam, except 
without the napalm, screaming, 
burning children, and other 
quaint features of actual warfare. 
The similarity is this: When you go 
out, you have no idea what kind of 
heaven, hell, hot bodies or high-
way patrol sobriety checks you 
may face. 

Newsflash: You are no longer a 
little child, and if you are reading 
this you are no fool , so you cannot 
expect God's angels to watch out 
for you. 

Gather information. You have 
to know where the party is before 
you and yours can attack. Ask 
around. Do not be subtle. Do not 
ever say, "Hey, give me a ring next 
time." They will forget. Ask only 
about what is on for the next 
weekend. Ask that fly looking 
slacker who keeps sleeping 
through your bio lecture. That's 
probably me, and baby, I'll let you 
know. 

Create a plan of attack. Line up 
two or three parties in one night. 
Anyone party might suck, get 
busted, or fail to occur. 

Create a pack. The best defense 
is a good offense - or something 
like that. Set out for the night with 
eight good friends in two cars, and 
if all else fails you can always hit 
Denny's in style or go back to the 
dorms and play drunk Twister. 

Take care of each other. Watch 
each other's backs, do head

6 OPINION The UCSD Guardian 

Revelle Administration's Actions Backfire 
Banning large televisions from suites lacks common sense 
By RYAN DARBY 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Would YOll believe me if I told 
you that Revelle administrators 
think a 13-inch television is a big-
ger fire hazard than a wood table. 
wood desk, wood sofa. wood bed. 
wood shelves. wood doors. wood 
closets and wood chairs? 

Well. they do. 
As ridiculous as this may 

sound. Revelle college forbids 
televisions to be left in students' 
suites. ci ting them as fire hazards. 
This inane rule states that a televi-
sion may only be in the shared 
suite area if it is being watched 
and that the moment it is turned 
off. it must be ui\plugged and 
placed inside one of the rooms. If 
the owner fails to do so. he is, writ-
ten up. 

.Although we all just love 
repeating the tedious process of 
setting up the television and 
unplugging i't shortly thereafter (a 
very therapeutic way to spend a 
study break. of course). it is hard-
ly worth the effort just to watch a 
single television show. 

The idea itself is JUSt plain 
ridiculous. What is so flammable 
about a 13-inch television? Think 

Waste: 
Misuse of energy rampant 
in America 
continued from paCe 4 
wanted in their backyards? We 
would sink into anarchy! 

Economically. liberals talk as 
if an early destruction of clothes 
were something negative. while it 

about it: The television is made 
out of plastic. but virtually every-
thing else in the suite is made out 
of wood or flammable cloth. I am 
far more worried about the wood-
en table bursting into flames than 
the television that sits on top of it. 

Furthermore. how can a televi-
sion possibly be a bigger fire haz-
ard than the microwaves many of 
us have in our rooms? To my 
knowledge. more fires have been 
started by unattended microwaves 
than by unattended televisions. 

How can Revelle possibly justi-
fy its claim? None of the other 
colleges have this absurd rule. I 
called the provost's office to find 
out. and was told that someone 
would call back with information. 
Unfortunately. no one returned 
my call. so one can only speculate 
about the rationale being applied 
here. • 

The fact that televisions are 
electric will not fly; we have elec-
tric lights bolted to the walls. Wor-
ried about water dripping on it? 

o. 1 think that an electrical out-
let placed within a foot of the 
bathroom sinks is a bit more dan-
gerous. Won'ied about tripping on 
the power cord? Come on. if you 
panic during a fire. you're more 

is absolutely necessary in order 
to keep our major department 
stores - one of the most impor- . 
tant fo rces of our economy -
solvent. and to foster the devel-
opment of the highly profitable 
loans-for-clothes business. 

Liberals are using provably 
false arguments to defend posi-
tions that deny the bas ic princi-
ples on which our great country 
was founded. 

likely to get your foot stuck in the 
wastebasket than trip over that. 
Spontaneous combustion? A tele-
vision is about as likely to sponta-
neously combust as a bowl of 
corn flakes. 

Then what can it be? The lack 
of a sprinkler system? If the 
school thinks these buildings 
would be seriously endangered in 
the case of a fire. we should not be 
living in them. 

While we do n'Ot need to have 
a television in our suites to sur-
vive. it would definitely make life 'a 
bit easier. Besides. what is so 
wrong with leaving a small televi-
sion in our suite? Yes. there is a 
risk of theft. but if that is a risk the 
owner is willing to take. then so be 
it. It is neith er the school's 
responsibility nor its jurisdiction 
to tell students where they can or 
cannot leave their televisions. 

Keep in mind that these are 
fresh men students living in' the 
residence halls. Does the adminis-
tration want us to feel like this is 
truly our home or like we are-
guests? A 13-inch television really 
is not that great a safety risk. and 
if no one is bothered by it. then 
why not allow us to leave it in our 
suites? 

I would have a lot more to say 
on the argument. but the usual 
July thunderstorms have once 
again risen the sea level to the 
height of my apartment in the 
Mission Hills. and I have to go 
bailout water. If only. instead of 
listening to the incessant liberal 
whining. Congress would once 
and for all repeal the minimum 
wage so I could at least afford to 
have somebody do it for me!

I 

Fanmail Make. For An 
Inter.st~ng Read 
Anpnymous reader sends bizzare yet 
fascinating letter to UCSD columnist 

DIVYA RUNCHAL 
, 

At first 1 thought it was a joke. 
I mean . who really has the time to 
write a two-page. single-spaced 
letter when she could be shaving 
her armpits instead? This thought 
plagued my mind as I read over 
the fascinating. if not unintelligi-
ble. letter fro m an anonymous 
"fan." 

Don't get me wrong. It's not 
that ('m ungrateful to my loyal 
readers. I just wish "fan" mail 
would really mean "fan" mail. 
instead of a diatribe against the 
current American political infra-
structure. 

When my editor first called me 
to tell me I had a package to pick 
up. I dropped everything and ran to 
my car. As I sped toward UCSD. 
images of adoring letters from gor-
geous. intelligent. single men 
danced in my head. 

I could picture it in my head: 
"Dear Divya: it would begin. "your 
prose is sweet music to my unwor-
thy ears. Please be mine now and 
forever: or. "Dear Divya: Enclosed 
is a first -class ticket for a flight on 
Air France. Meet me on the top of 
the Eiffel Towel. Love. Pierre (a.k.a. 
handsome and wealthy exchange 
student). " 

As I' walked into the office. my 
heart th robbing and my head ring-

ing. I was filled with gleeful antici-
pation. However. my joy quickly 
turned into confusion after I 
opened a thick manila envelope 
and found. to my chagrin, docu-
ments on science and abortion 
instead of flowery poetry. I couldn't 
believe it. Here was my first fan 
mail and it was a dis~ppointmet\t! 

I realized the "fan" letter may 
not actually have been from an 
admirer at all when I saw t~e line 
"Your writing could have been seen 
as humorous with a little more 
work/polish on it: Call me hairy 
and an idiot. but no,! funny? That's 
a direct stab to my heart. 

Worse. instead of commenting 
on my article. the author encour<-' 
aged me to watch "CSPA for a. 
year or two" in order to "become 
an expert on thr real issues." Sorry. 
dear reader. but I don't have cable. 
so that's an impossibi lity. Besides. 
aren't pointless articles more 
enjoyable than suffering through 
boring congressional speeches? 

At least the author. who is obvi-
ously an intelligent person. had 
good intentions. After a lengthy 
discussion on everything from 
Napoleon to abortion. the author 
finally got to the good part: me. I 
am sure he or she was being con-
siderate when stating. "Keep some 
of your paranoia ." 

it will protect you from some-
thing worse "trying to become a 
syrupy goody two-shoes." but it 
sounded like something Ted 
Kaczynski would say. 

Anyway. l'm sure my parents

Editor, 
Hmmm ... some say UCSD lift 

needs more spice? I agree entirely. 
It's sad to see students who 

chose to come here for college 
ridicule the endlessly dead week-
ends and lack of student unity. 
UCSD and pride are two words 
that simply cannot go together for 
such reasons. We have no football 
team. no reason to paint our faces . 
and show sufficient pride or even ' 
develop a rivalry . . 

The administration simply does 
not understand this: there are two 
sports which college students go 
crazy over. football and basketball .. 

Sure it was nice to move up to 
Division II. but football is what this 
campus needs. 

Additionally. as a resl!lt of sky-
rocketing rent fees in La jolla. 
UCSD is becoming more of a com-
muter school. Now. why would 
such commuters even find any such 
reason to make the long drive back 
to campus and hang out? To go to 
the library? Oh please. However. the 
library is pretty much one of the few 
things open on campus late at night. 
There simply is nothing to do here 
on the weeltcnds, no big football 
match-up to look folWlJ'd to. no frat 
row to hit up. nothing to do even 
within walking distance of campus. 

What I have seen around my 
donns is that students find it more 
beneficial to $0 home for the week-
e!1ds than enjoy thei~ college cxpe-
nence away from·thelr parents. Are 
there any fun traditions here at 
UCSD (besides stuc¥ng) that have 
been thus far estabhshed?, 1 admit 
that the all-campus dance at the 
beginning of the year was cool, but 
why not more of such all-campus 
events? 

US NtwS and World report ranks 
UCSD lower than I believe it 
deserves because of its low alumni 
contribution. What was it 200th in 
the nation? The reason for this is 
because alumni have no programs. 
i.e. athletics. to give back to. There 
has been nothing truly extraordi-
nary about my college Mexperience" 
here at UCSD up to now. What will 
I remember thus far of the Mcultur-
al mecca" that is UCSD? Oppres-
sive administration. one hell of a 
lot of studying. and a lack of stu-
dent unity and pride that desper-
ately needs improving.

ORLD & NATION 
Federal Government to Leave Interest 
Rates Unchanged 

WASHINGTON - Citing 
clear evidence that the economy 
has shifted into a lower gear, the 
Federal Reserve voted Wednesday 
to hold interest rates steady, I!ut 
with unemployment low and 
energy prices high the central 
bank said it was not yet ready to 
proclaim that inflation is no 
longer a threat. . 

The Fed's policy-setting Fed-
eral Open Market Committee did 
not allude to the uncertainty over 
the outcome of the presidential 
election or to the recent jitters in 
the stock market, but instead pro-
jected a business-as-usual tone in 
a statement that stressed the grad-
ual cooling of the economy. 

The statement said that eco-
nomic growth appears to have 
slowed to a rate below what most 
economists consider to be its 

Bush: 
Gore's allies have forged 
ahead with a recount 
ContI ..... fro. ..... 1 

State Katherine Harris, a Republi-
can, propelled the situation to a 
critical tum. Allies of Vice Presi-
dent AI Gore forged ahead with 
the hand recounts and possible 
funher coun challenges. but aides 
to Gov. George W. Bush of lexas 
claimed to see the end in sight. 

At about 7:40 p.m., Harris 
appeared on national television to 

non-inflationary speed limit of 
around 4 percent a year. 

That is the outcome the Fed 
was working toward in imposing a 
series of six rate increases, totaling 
1.75 percentage points. between 
June 1999 and May of this year. 

But the committee stressed 
that it still sees "a risk of height-
ened inflation pressures" stem-
ming from the low rate of jobless-
ness - 3.9 percent in October-
and the rise earlier this year in oil 
prices. 

As a result, the committee 
said, it would remain on alert for 
inflation, a signal to Wall Street 
that it is not yet ready to contem-
plate reducing interest rates. 

Some investors had been bet-
ting that the Fed would sound the 
all-clear on inflation, and the out-
come of Wednesday's meeting led 

announce that with all 67 counties 
reporting by the legal deadline of 5 
p.m., Bush led by exactly 300 votes, 
or 2,910,492 to Gore's 2,910,192 
votes, pending the counting of an 
unknown number of overseas 
absentee ballots due by midnight 
Friday. Her action followed a mid-
day ruling by a state .judge who . 
upheld Tuesday's deadline for all 
counties to certify their votes, but 
said that later returns could also be 
considered. 

Less than an hour later, Gore's 
campaign chairman, William M. 
Daley, took to the airwaves to 
accuse Harris of trying to cut,off 

to a broad fall in stock prices from 
their levels just before the com-
mittee's statement was released 
around 2:15 p.m. The Dow Jones 
industrial average, which had 
been up 115 points, dropped into 
negative territory after the Fed 
announced its decision. The Dow 
later recovered somewhat, closing 
at 10,707.60, up 26.54. . 

Analysts said that if the econo-
my remains on its current path, 
the Fed could consider dropping 
its policy "bias" toward raising 
rates as soon 3S its next meeting, 
on Dec. 19, and shift to a neutral 
policy that assumes the risks of 
inflation are no greater than the 
risk of the economy slowing too 
much.

the count in a way "not required 
by the court." He said it was "just 
another attempt to slow this 
down." 

It was not clear just how much 
authority Harris has. While Harris 
said she was basing her position on 
the ruling Tuesday in the Leon 
County Circuit Court, Judge Terry 
P. Lewis said she had discretion on 
whether to include any recounts in 
the final tally. But he said that the 
local election boards had the 
authority to decide whether a man-
ual recount should be done.

Israelis Kill 8 Palestinians in a Day 
of Widespread Uproar 

JERUSALEM - Israeli heli-
copter gunships struck at Pales-
tinian targets in the West Bank 
after a day of surging violence in 
which Israeli soldiers shot and 
killed eight Palestinians and 
wounded dozens in raging street 
battles. 

The helicopter missile strikes 
early Wednesday came after a 
meeting of Prime Minister Ehud 
Barak's security Cabinet. Barak 
had been under pressure to order 
a tough military response to the 
Palestinian killing of four Israelis 
on Monday. 

More than 220 people, most 
Palestinians, have been killed in a 
Palestinian uprising now in its 
seventh week. Palestinians say the 
violence will continue until Israel 
withdraws from the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip. 

The Israeli army said that after 
midnight. helicopters attacked 
offices of the Fatah movement in 

Hebron, Tulkarm and Salfit, and a 
munitions base of the Palestinian 
security forces in jericho. Gun-
men from Fatah, the mainstream 
Palestinian political faction, have 
been at the forefront of the upris-
ing, shooting at soldiers and jew-
ish settlements. 

In Hebron, witnesses said heli-
copters fired at least three missiles-
at empty buildings of the local 
Fatah headq uarters, starting fires 
and shattering windows. Reports 
from Salfit indicated that there 
were several casualties. 

Israeli helicopters also hit 
buildings in Beit Jala after shots 
were fired from the town at the 
Jewish neighborhood of Gilo in 
southern Jerusalem. In addition, 
Israeli soldiers fired back with 
machine guns. Palestinians report-
ed from Beit Jala that a German 
resident married to a local woman 
was killed by shrapnel as he tried 
to help wounded neighbors. Seven 

people were wounded by Israeli 
fire and two buildings were 
destroyed, the Palestinians said. 

Gilo has been fired at from Beit 
Jala nightly. On Wednesday the 
shooting set one apartment ablaze 
and damaged another. Angry resi-
dents protested, demanding 
tougher military action to sup-
press the Palestinian shooting. 

Street fighting raged across the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip on 
Wednesday, one of the deadliest 
days in the past seven weeks. 

Israeli soldiers shot and killed 
eight Palestinians and wounded 
dozens in clashes that followed 
funerals of Palestinians killed on 
Thesday and marches marking the 
anniversary of a symbolic declara-
tion of independence by Yasser 
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, in 
Algiers in 1988.

Tallban: 
Television in Afghanistan 
is facing extinction 
CoIdI ............... l . 

ing only half of Faizabad, but few 
citizens complain. Most don't have 
lVs anyway, and of those who do, 
most don't have electricity. 

"Yes, we have some technologi-
cal limitations; said the station 
manager, Muhammad Din Kha-
hani, as the light from a single bulb 
in his office faded in and out. "But 
many people in our city do love 
television, even the reruns we have 
been showing for 16 years." 

Television in Afghanistan is fac-
ing extinction. The Taliban mullahs. 
who control 90 to 95 percent of the 
country, have grievances against the 
medium that go far beyond the 
usual complaints about rotten 
shows. They contend that living 
beings should not be photographed, 
which has led to rather unforgiving 
censorship. Television stations have 
been shuttered; television sets have 
been broken; television watchers 
have been thrashed. 

Faizabad, however, is in the 
nation's far northeast, a small terri-
tory that has hdd out against Tal-
iban rule. It is the biggest city in 
Badakhshan province and also the 

latest refuge of President Burhanud-
din Rabbani, who heads the feckless 
government that is recognized as 
legitimate by most of the world. 
Badakhshan Tv; like the opposition 
government that owns it, has defi-
antl)l made a stand, getting by on an 
unsure supply of fuel to run its gen-
erator and an aged video recorder. 

"It is quite a shame; said Kha-
hani, 38, a thin man with the quiet 
bearing of a scholar. "If it hadn't 
been for the war, this would be one 
of the most developed countries in 
the world." . 

By Khahani's estimate, there are 
5,000 sets in the city of 100,000 
residents, though many may well 
be broken. Movies are broadcast 
with subtitles in Dari. Indian films 
seem to be the most popular, with 
their simple romantic plots. Anoth-
er favorite is the American action 
flick "First Blood." Khahani, calm 
in demeanor and patient with 
questions, was actually quite busy. 
He was about to go out with a cam-
era crew to interview the president. 
And his job was being made no 
easier by a darkness that had over-
taken the small television station 
on the hill . 

Once again, the electricity was 
out.

The Case For a Serbian 
Democracy Without Purges 

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia - For 
President Vojislav Kostunica of 
Yugoslavia, trying to manage a diffi-
cult transition from the regime of 
Siobodan Milosevic while respecting 
legal niceties and holding together 
his broad coalition, the dections for 
a new Serbian government next 
month cannot come soon enough. 

But the rush to build a new 
democracy cannot be done radical-
ly, without building on the founda-
tions of the existing state, Kostuni-
ca said in an interview, rejecting 
arguments from his allies for a 
rapid purge of top commanders of 
the secret police and the army. 

In particular, he insisted, "it 
would be irresponsible to start 
experimenting" with the police. the 
secret police and the army "when 
we have no Parliament in Serbia 
and a strange type of transitional 
government." 

The Oct. 5 uprising that forced 
Milosevic to recognize Kostunica's 
election did not by itself change the 
Serbian government, where re~1 
power lies here. But pressure, 
negotiations and threats caused the 
Serbian government and Parlia-
ment to dissolve, with a provision-
al government in place and elec-
tions called for Dec. 23. 

After those elections, Kostunica 
said, with a newly elected Parliament 
and government. "then there could 

be a parliamentary commission that 
might dismiss all the top functionar-
ies of the secret police or the police 
generally or the interior ministry, 
and that's another situation: 

A sharp and all-too-public 
debate rages within the 18-party 
coalition, known as the Democrat-
ic Opposition of Serbia, or DOS, 
about the pace of change. 

Kostunica wants a deliberate 
process of elections and legality. 
Much of the coalition, domi!13ted by 
the Democratic Party leader, Zoran 
Djindjic. argues for more rapid and 
visible change now, both to satisfy 
public anger and to remove from 
power those most associated with 
the repressive pillars of Milosevic's 
rule: Radomir Markovic, the head of 
the secret police. and Gen. Nebojsa 
Pavkovic. the army chief of staff. 

Kostunica and Djindjic do not 
trust each another. Kostunica does 
not want Djindjic to control the 
secret police. or its files; Djindjic 
thinks Kostunica is not sufficiently 
committed to systemic change. 
Kostunica has a small party but is 
hugely popular; Djindjic has a large 
party but small electoral support, 
with high negatives. 

In that sense, they need each 
other.

In Palm Beach, the Confusion Party Reigns Supreme 
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -

It is not a circus here, say some 
people in Palm Beach County, 
when asked about the weirdness of 
its on-again, off-again vote 
recount. 

A circus is fun. 
This is not fun. 
"There are three parties now; 

said Don Stephenson, a waiter in 
Palm Beach, who said he under-
stood his "butterfly" ballot when he 
voted for Vice President AI Gore 
but has understood little of what 
has happened since. "We have a 

Democratic Party, a Republican 
Party and, now, a confused party. 
I'm in it." 

The votes here in Palm Beach 
County, whether dimpled, punched 
or plain unintelligible, may decide 
the presidency, but it is a day-to-
day drama - and sometimes hour-
to-hour - whether the votes will 
be eounted in time or counted at 
all . As of Wednesday evening, that 
was still unclear. 

Every few hours, the thr e peo-
ple who make up the county's 
canvassing board climb to their

high on a scaffold above the park-

fronted by television crews, politi-
cal operatives, reporters and a few 
voters - report that their recount 

is on, off or on again, dependillg 
on the most recent court deci-
sion . 

As of. Wednesday evening, the 
State Supreme Court had cleared 
the way for a recount, and it could 
have begun right away. But the 
canvassing board agreed to meet at 
1 p.m. on Thursday to continue to 
consider beginning a recount -
but not to begin it. 

The hesitation was apparently 
because Palm Beach County had 
asked the State Supreme Court for 
clarification of its own particular 

circumstances and wanted to wait 
until it received an answer. 

It has been a less than dignified, 
unsteady process, .Ieading some-
where to lament the atmosphere in 
which this history-making decision 
is being made.

man tourist who has been follow-

"We are hoping this study will

Gender Trend 
Reveals More 
Colle.e Women 

EAST LANSING, Mich . 
The male gender could be dwin-
dling - at least on college cam-
puses. 

Michigan State University 
English and theater education 
freshman Patti Wheeler has 
noticed the change, too. She said 
she saw a lot more women than 
men in her dorm when she moved 
in this year, and some of her class-
es are the same way. She is not 
shocked at all. 

"People have realized women 
can, in fact, do as many things as 
men can; Wheeler said. 

"It used to be the opportunities 
aren't presented because it was 
thought women can't do the job; 
she said. 

But they can, and they are tak-
ing the opportunity in force. The 
decades-long trend 'of declining 
enrollment of male college stu-
dents continues, and women con-
tinue to make up more of a major-
ity of students attending universi-
ties. 

According to the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education, 58 percent of 
the estimated 15 million college 
students nationwide are female. 
By 2008, the enrolled women pop-
ulation is expected to grow to 9.2 
million, while the number of men 
is projected to decline to 6.9 mil-
lion. 

Some are asking what this 
actually means. 

A report released last week says 
the trend goes beyond the male-
femak ratio. It says the trend is 
only limited to low-income and 
minority students, and is nothing 
new. 

"I wanted to take a closer look 
at the data and see whether it was 
substantial as a widespread gener-
al crisis or just a specific prob-

lem: said Jacqueline King, direc-
tor of the Center for Policy Analy-
sis at die American Council on 
Education. 

. King, the author of the repon, 
examined how race, age and 
income level affect the gender gap 
in high school graduation rates, 
college preparation levels. college 
enronments and the number of 
bachelor's degrees earned. 

She said she found .that, in all 
areas, income and race outweigh 
gender as determining factors in 
who enters and graduates from 
COllege. 

"It's not that middle class white 
men aren't going to college; King 
said. "There's a gender disparity-
women are going to college at a 
higher rate." 

King said in lower-income 
groups there were higher percent-
ages of women than men enrolled 
in every ethnic group. As income 
increased, the gender gap disap-
peared among all ethnic groups 
except African Americans. 

For white students, the differ-
ence between men and women 
was small for all income levels -
just 51 percent female to 49 per-
cent male. 

King cites the continuously 
increasing return to school after 
childbearing or marriage as one of 
the main reasons women make up 
such a large percen tage. Of the 

The UCSD Guardian 

one-third of undergraduates older 
than 25, most are women. That 
makes their role of nontraditional 
students pivotal. 

James Cotter, the university'S 
senior associate director of admis-
sions, said the gender trend is 
common at MSU, too. Overall, 
female enTollment is at 53.1 per-
cent, and this year's incoming 
freshman class is 56.1 percent 
female. 

"Women went in the majority 
in enrollment back in 1986; Cot- · 
ter said. "It's not a phenomenon 
.unique to MSU; it's happening 
nationally." 

Cotter said the surge actually 
began in the 1970s and the trend 
has continued since. 

"If you look at the start of the 
female movement,' it parallels the 
surge of opportunities for 
females; he said. "They're seeing 
a broader range of opportunities 
for women professionally than 
there were 20 to 25 years ago." 

But Cotter maintains that 
recruitment, because of opportu-
nities for financial aid and grants, 
remains independent of income, 
ethnicity and gender. 

"In terms of recruitment, we 
don't conduct gender-specific 
recruitment, just as we don't do 
income-specific recruitment," he 
said.

MADISON, Wis. - Isolated 
voting irregularities at campus-
area polling places in the 2000 
election have raised questions as 
to how effectively current policy 
protects against voter fraud . 

Several University of Wiscon-
sin-Madison students reported 
being allowed to use a personal 
letter as proof of residence to reg-
ister to vote. Several students also 
said they did not have any identi-
fication on hand containing proof 
of residence but were allowed to 
re-register to vote. In related inci-
dents, voters who wished to 
remain anonymous told The Daily 
Cardinal they were allowed to reg-
ister without showing identifica-
tion. 

To register to vote in the state 
of Wisconsin, a person must have 
at least one form of acceptable 
proof of residence. Current Wis-
consin law states that "an accept-
able form of identification 
includes a current and complete 
name and residential address." 

Some forms of acceptable 
proof of residence include a Wis-
consin driver's license; another 
license issued by a Wisconsin gov-

ern mental body; a residrntiallease 
that is effective for the period that 
includes the election; OT a gas, 
electric or telephone sen ice state--
ment for the period not earlier 
than 90 days before the election. 

Deputy City Clerk Sharon 
Christensen said this list is not all-
inclusive. 

"What we tell (the election offi-
cials) is that the document con-
taining proof of residence should 
be some commercial document, 
not personal mail, not magazines, 
those types of things," Chris-
tensen said. 

She said election officials are 
instructed not to accept personal 
mail. However, Christensen said, 
"These decisions are at their dis-
cretion. We cannot limit officials 
to accepting only what is on the 
list, because of course there are 
lots of people who don't have 
those forms of identification." 

UW-Madison political science 
Professor Donald Downs said he 
believes the system needs to be 
tightened. 

"There's not enough scrutiny 
when people show up at the 
polls; Downs said. "Voter fraud 
could become an issue."

The UCSD Guardian 

, Collegiate: 
Wtsconsin allows election 
day registration 
ContII . .. frOIII ..... . 
before the Thursday prior to the 
election, then training was provid-
ed for them. 

If a person volunteered after 
that Thursday, Christensen said 
his training was then left to the 
other people working at the 
polling place. 

One UW-Madison student, 
who asked to remain anonymous, 
worked at the polls as an election 
official and said he did not feel as 
though he received enough 
instruction. 

"I got notarized in about 10 
minutes, and as far as telling us 
what we should ask the voters for, 
no one was of much help," he said. 

The student said more often 
than not, when a person did not 
have the proper identification to 
register to vote, he and the other 
poll workers would simply have a 
witness verify the person's identi-
ty. 

If that witness was an elector of 
the same municipality as the indi-
vidual he or she was identifying, 
then that procedure falls within 
state law, 

"If people have the wrong 
.motivation, the system could be 
really subject to abuse," said 
Downs. 

According to a Federal Elec-
tions Commission spokesperson, 
Wisconsin is one of only six states 
that allow election day registra-
tion, 

Kevin Kennedy, director of the 
State Elections Board, voiced 
some concern with regard to elec-
tion day registration . "Are we 
encouraging fraud, or what are we 

doing here?" he said. In other 
states you have to register to vo~e 
30 days before the election, or 
you're out of luck. 

A spokesperson from the FEC 
said that having "an early-registra-
tion period, two or more weeks 
before the election, seems to have 
helped a lot" in curbing voter 
fraud in other states. 

"Something that happens with 
any system is that the longer you 
do it, the more you take it for 
granted. So your practices get 
sloppy," Kennedy added. 
• Alderman Mike Verveer, Dis-
trict 4, stressed the need for a 
greate~ number of trained poll 
workers. He referred to the 
"Eleventh-hour volunteer effort" 
that was needed to make sure the 
polls had enough workers. 

"The bottom line is that the 
city needs to do a better job 
recruiting and retaining poll 
workers, period," he said. 

Another issue surrounding 
recent elections has concerned 
absentee voting. Attorney Mike 
Witten wyler, a lecturer at the UW-
Madison Law School, said poten-
tial abuse of absentee: voting could 
especially be an issue on college 
campuses. The Marquette University 
Tribune reponed Thesday that a 
survey it conducted indicated 95 
studen ts both voted by absentee 
ballot in their home state and 
voted in Wisconsin. 

"Because most students have 
two residences, they can vote 
absentee back at home, and then 
they can sign up to vote here. 
There is the ability to do it if they 
wanted to do it ," Wittenwyler said. 

According to the FEC, there is. 
no federal tracking system for 
absentee voting. 

Christensen said she dot::s not 
think voter fraud is a concern but 
that a ·student "probably could" 

Thursday, November16, 2000 

vote twice. 
"I hope people would be hon-

est, but maybe I'm just being 
naive: she said, 

Witten wyler, however, said he 
thinks voter fraud is a concern. 

"It's always a concern because 
of the fact that the election 
process that we have in the Unit-
ed States is based on trust," he 
said. "And because of that, at 
some point you have to make a 
decision on how much trust 
you're willing to tolerate to allow 
maybe a little bit of fraud," he 
said, 

Wittenwyler said he thinks that 
·without changing a single law," 
voter fraud could .be greatly less-
ened by paying closer attention to 
curre1\t policy, 

"Maybe the system isn't bro-
ken, we're just not enforcing the 
rules we already have," he said. 

Kennedy stressed that every-
one is working to ensure that 
there is confidence in the out-
come of the election but added 
that the system is not perfect. 

·Yes, there are difficulties, but 
the process -is staffed by human 
beings," he said . "Everyone 
involved brings their human qual-
ities to the process." 

Jason Hanson, assistant Dane 
County district attorney, said he 
believes that referrals of voter 
fraud to his office are rare because 
of the hefty penalty involved, 

He said that a violation of vot-
ing more than once carries a 
prison sentence of up to four and 
a half years and up to a $10,000 
fine. 

"It is fair to say that there are 
probably shortcomings in our 
ability to find out if people are 
committing fraud: he said. "Like 
all facets of criminal law, we have 
situations where sman people just 
don 't get caught."

The Word of Mouth

he Word of Mouth Tour was defi-
nitely more "word of mouth" this 
year than last year. If you're not 
familiar with it, it is a hip-hop 
tour with an underground aes-
thetic - one for people who love 

the music and the art of hip-hop. 
Performing live were MC Supernatural, the 

Beat Junkies, Dilated Peoples, Cut Chemist, OJ 
Nu-Mark and Jurassic 5, who were headlining, It 
was amazing to see how large the turnout was for 
the two scheduled shows on Nov. 8 and Nov. 9 at 
the Belly Up Tavern. 

Compared to last summer's Word Of Mouth 
Tour at 4th & B, the house was packed. It seems 
that Jurassic 5 and Dilated Peoples have rounded 
up a more diverse fan base since appearing on 
popular music video channels. 

The Beat Junkies kicked off the show with feats ' 
of turntablism, followed by Cut Chemist and OJ 
Nu-Mark, who did a set before introducing Super-
natural, who has an impressive talent for 
freestyling and getting audience panicipation. His 
skill$ for coming up with lyrics on the fly were 
extraordinary, espeCIally since he asked for words 
from the audience for his rap "Three Words" and 

HIATUS 11 

u s

ende~ up with words like '"philharmonic," which 
are not easy to freestyle with. 

In another song, he took items from the audi-
ence's hands and added them into the rhyme -
random objects such as condoms, Tic Tacs and 
Advil. His other impressive feat was his right-on 
impers.onations of famous MCs. Every time he 
turned hi~ back to the audience, he would imper-
sonate Biggie, Xhibit, Wu·Tang or Busta Rhymes, 
Last year, Supernatural blessed the stage in the 
Price Center with completely different imperson-
ations. 

In pan of the song, Supernatural enacted a duet 
between himself and Biggie and astounded the 
audience with how well he could impersonate him. 
Supernatural 's performance and energy were 
amazing. He came back in the end ,for a rap intro 
of all the performers in the tour. 

The up-and-coming hip-hop duo from Los 
Angeles, Dilated Peoples, took the stage next. 
The group consists of Iriscience, Evidence and 
DJ Babu from the Beat Junkies. Their sound is a 
bit aggressive ~nd their beats are driving and' 
lucid.

Get More Than Just Blockbusters for.Your Buck 
Step away from your new releases and step into the strange and obscure 
By RINALDO DORMAN 
Contributing Hiatus Writer 

In the constant search for the 
unique and wonderful, look no 
further than Blockbuster Video's 
"Pre-Viewed" movie section. With 
a little time and a little money, you 
can invest in your own movie col-
lection, with a surprising selection 
of low-cost gems. 

In this section, you'll find hun-
dreds of titles from every movie 
genre. The idea is pretty simple: 
The store gets multiple copies of a 
video when it is a new release, the 
title moves over to anotber shelf 
when it is no longer a new. release, 
and they sell tne rest off, which 
means a good buy for you. 

The first thing to keep in mind 
with any bargain hunt is that you 
must be will ing to invest some time 
in looking. You are liable to find the 
prospect somewhat daunting, so 

here's a breakdown of the pricing. 
All movies for sale are priced 

according to how recently they 
were released and their general 
popularity. So the older and lesser-
known films are the best deals here. 

To find movies good for when 
you are extremely bored or stoned, 
you can browse the $2.99 section. 
Be forewarned that most of these 
are movies that no one has ever 
heard of. But considering their cur-
rent sale, which offers $2 off any 
previously viewed movie, this 
option is tantalizing. 

We'll start at the low end. For 
$3.33, I found "Corporate Fantasy,' 
a 1999 ultra-soft-core porn, the 
kind that only a family video store 
would carry. It was so lame that not 
even the Fox network would show 
it. If not for its shits-and-giggles 
value, this movie would never leave 
the store. 

Moving up to $5 movies, there 

is a dynamic improvement in the "Welcome to Woop Woop' is a 
quality of movies available. From a bizarre contribution to the arts 
1995 MTV series comes "~on from Down Under. It's the twisted 
Flux: a futuristic cartoon sci-fi tale of a New York con artist on the 
with a lot of sexual overtones. ~on lam in Australia, where he wakes 
Flux is an agent for the fictional, up to find that the hitchhiker he 
communist country of Bregna and picked up is now his teen-age wife 
she has a lovelhatelkill relationship and tha her beer-guzzling psycho 
with Trevor Goodchild, an oppos- father is the ruler of a town that no 
ing nation's leader. Goodchild is one is allowed to leave. It's some-
incredibly evil and that turns Flux . thing like "The Addams Family'-
on and pisses her off, so her goal is meets-Australia on acid. A must for 
to kill him or sleep with him. Most the quirky - it's odd, but funny, 
know this show for the mega-gore and your friends will think you are 
factor and the surreal twists that some kind of freak for owning 
completely lose you. It's definitely a movies like this. 
cult classic in the making. Also recommended is Martin 

Other notable titles · include Scorsese's latest and strangest, 
"Drop Dead Gorgeous: "The "Bringing Out The Dead." It tracks 
Corndog Man: "Titanic' (shud- two days in the life of burnt-out 
der), and "Welcome To Woop paramedic Frank Pierce and his 
Woop." The last title is directed by descent into madness and subse-
Stephan Elliot, the same guy who quent redemption. It is a very dark 
made "The Adventures of Priscilla, and gritty movie and it doesn't 
Queen of the Desert." always manage to make sense. The 

plot has a couple of ambulance-
sized holes, but Pierce'~ bizarre 
partners and his attempts at getting 
fired keep things interesting. Basi-
cally, Pierce can't get past the mem-
ories of people he could not save. 
This film is in the middle of the 
price range, listing at $7. 
. Finally, we · have the full-priced 
videos at $14. These are the must-
haves, the classics that will not be 
going down in price, or the movies 
that you just want now. Two ous-
tanding selections in this group are 
"Dune: a sci-fi epic, and "Drowing 
Mona." 

The latter is a hysterical comedy 
about dismemberment, semi-acci-
dental death, and covering your 
ass. Bette Midler gets killed off and 
everyone in town is a suspect, 
including her husband and son. 
Packed with famous faces, you may 
want to wait for this movie to drop 
in price.

Review: ~~~[illrnm~ 

Guru's Jazzmatazz 
"Streetsoul" 

MeA Records 

C-
Quite a few years back, 

Anheuser-Busch mounted a huge 
ad campaign in an attempt to pro-
mote responsible drinking. The 
centerpiece of its campaign was a 
brilliant slogan that ultimate ly 
became embedded in America's 
collective national consciousness. 
It went something like this: "Know 
when to say '''hen ." Now, I must 
admit I do not know whether th is 
product of marketing genius was 
effective fo r its intended purpose. 

In any case, I believe that this 
phrase should be taken to heart by 
all, and it should not be exclusively 
applied to responsible alcohol con-
sumption. It should also be direct-
ed toward the continuous, inexcus-
able production of potentially great 
- but ultimately mediocre - hip-

hop recordings. Guru's latest 
Jazzmatazz endeavor is an excellent 
example of this sad trend. 

Let's be brutally honest for a 
minute. Everyone knows that Guru 
has never been a very good MC, 
but for some reason many people 
seem hesitant to admit it. Why is 
that? What do people think they 
owe him? It is well past time for 
this shameful facade to end. MCing 
is a continuously evolving art form, 
and few can argue that Guru mere-
ly has not kept up with the times. 

For the most part, Guru 's lyrics 
these days are inane and un in-
spired, and his flow is often nonex-
istent. His trademark deadpan 
voice used to be novel. but now it 's 
just annoying. He is excet!dingly 
arrogant regarding his so-called 
"skills" on the mic, although in 
most cases it is painfu lly obvious 
that if he did n't have Premiere 
backi ng him up, he never would 
have blown up in the first place. 

This is not to discredit him 
entirely, of course. As a part of 
Gang Sta rr, Guru has made a sig-
nifica nt contibution to hip-hop as 
a whole, but that's because Gang 
Starr was a formulaic success that 
focused and relied mainly on Pre-
miere's beats and production. 

Mr. "Gifted Unlimited Rhymes 
Universal" may have been some-
what lyrically impressive on 
"Words I Manifest," but he hasn't 
progressed much since then. All of 
this might sound too harsh, but it's 
readily apparent. Just consider your 
favorite Gang Starr tracks from 
past albums. Odds are, they're the 

The UCSD Guardian 

cuts with the special guests who 
shined while Guru did his best to 
avoid ruining the whole damn 
thing. 

Now, to Guru's credit, it should 
be noted that his first Jazzmatazz 
album was certainly innovative, 
groundbreaking and relatively well-
done. It spawned a number of com-
mercially successful singles, while 
stretching rap, R&B and jazz in 
whole new directions. 

The problem is that Guru has-
n't been able to follow it up, 
because he's been too busy pro-
moting himself on the two subse-
quent Jazzmatazz albums, this one 
included. On "Jazzmatazz Vol. 1," 
his vocals seemed to blend almost 
seamlessly wi th the guest artist 
contributions, and more often than 
not, his vocals were appropriate to 
the song's subject. 

This is not the case any more. 
Lately, Guru's incessant demand . 
for respect seems to be sabotaging 
his art, with every other verse or 
skit on Streetsoul talking about 
how great he is, whether it's a 
would-be revolutionary anthem 
like "Lift Your Fist" (featuring the 
Roots) or a supposed seductive 
love ballad like "Night Vision" 
(with Isaac Hayes) . Simply put, his 
self-aggrandizing rhymes ruin 
almost every colfaboration on this 
album - especially the ones that 
would have been definite hits if he 
just toned it down a little. 

Maybe that's why I've been so 
hard on Guru here; it's just too dis-
appointing to hear so many collab-
orations with respected artists like 

the Roots, Isaac Hayes and Herbie 
Hancock ~o down the toilet thanks 
to Guru s insipid vocals. The 
potential was there, and there are a 
few bright spots on this album, but 
for the most part, this album is a 
huge letdown. Friends shouldn't let 
friends pick this one up.

wilts on the album's mournful last 
track. 

"Stories" is one of those albums 
you have to listen to from start to 
finish . It is like a novel and it tells a 
story. The album begins with Har-
vey longing for "a different land" in 
"Big Exit." Harvey and her mysteri-
ous companion discover New York 
with wide-eyed wonderment and 
fearless enthusiasm, Ilke two 
tourists who just got a hotel room 
overlooking Central Park. But their 
love does not last fo rever. After the 
gliner of ew York fades, Harvey 
and her lover go their separate ways 
as the album concludes with 
"Horses in My Dreams" and finally 
"We Float." 

Musica lly, "Stories" is mort! 
access ible than past PJ Harvey 
albums. In the past, Harvey's sense 
of melody could have been hard to 
take in . However, "Stories" offe rs a 
mix of experimental melodies as 
well as tunes that will have you 
singing along in your car. The opti-
mistic "Good Fortune" sounds 
oddly reminiscent of Liz Phair's 
"Exile in Guyville," while "This 
Mess We're In," on which Radio-
head's TIlom Yorke adds vocals, is 
classic Harvey. 

Harvey has created an amazing 
album that has the depth of great 
literature and the drama of a good 
movie. "Stories from the City, Sto-
ries from the Sea" is enough to 
make you want to hop on a plane 
and go find New York for yourself.

Word: 
Jurassic 5 appeared with 
a "Quality" set 

During the summer they 
released their debut album, titled 
"The Platform," and released the 
single "Triple Optics" on the 
"Funky Precedent" compilation, 
which included groups such as 
Jurassic 5. They amped the crowd 
with the performance of "'Il'iple 
Optics" and their single "Work the 
Angles." 

Dilated Peoples were able to 
maintain their 

through popular media like MlV 
or BET. 

Dance circles formed, and the 
audience knew the lyrics and the 
members' names when the micro-
phone was pointed at it. At one 
point, Cut Chemist was telling the 
audience what songs he had just 
spun with Nu-Mark: "The third 
song is from ' Brand Nubian,' 
which might be a little under-
ground for some of you." This 
insult to the audience probably 
caused some pleasure for real fans. 

To get the crowd hyped up, 
members of Jurassic 5 dtd a little 
stage diving, which turned out dis-
mal in the end. Some audience 

underground sen-
sibilities - there-
fore, much of the 
crowd was not 
familiar with their 
talent. However, 
the duo kept the 
audience's heads 
bobbing with its 
dynamism, con-
stant movement 
and overwhelming 
co'nfidence, which 
showed through in 
theit lyrics. At the 
end of their set, 
Evidence broke a 
beer bottle over his 

Jurassic 5 delivered 
the full flavor of 
thdrinnovariveand 
authentic sound that 
celebrates music, not 
money, which is 
refreshing after all 
the recent 
deliverances in hip-
hop music. 

members ran up 
on stage to dive, 
and then one 
drunken and very 
large fan dove off 
the stage and 
landed on his 
neck. This ended 
the show a little 
sooner than it was 
supposed to end, 
with ambulances 
and rubber neck-
ing. 

Although the 
end was a big dis-
appointment, 
there was no way 
the performers 

head as a dare and actually ended 
up momentarily knocking himself 
out. 

When Jurassic 5 made their 
appearance, it was obvious whom 
the majority of the crowd had 
come to see. Half their set was 
from their self-titled EP and the 
other half was from t~eir recently 
released album "Quality Control." 
The single "Quality Control." 
made the crowd go wild. Surpris-
ingly, their earlier singles, such as 
"Jayou" and "Concrete School-
yard" left most of the crowd a lit-
tle quiet. 

Jurassic 5 delivered the full fla-
vorofltreir innovative and authen-
tic sound that celebrates music, not 
money, which is refreshing after all 
the recent deliverances in hip-hop 
music. 

As usual, Jurassic 5 put on a 
charismatic performance with their 
organic sounds, ham10nized cho-
ruses and their incorporation of 
different elements of hip-hop. 

In one part of the show, break 
dancers came out, and the show 
highlighted the talent of DJs Nu-
Mark and Cut Chemist, whose 
extensive collection of rare grooves, 
instructional and hip-hop music 

. drives Jurassic 5's cutttng-edge 
sound. 

OJ Nu-Mark amazed the crowd 
by playing the drum set, drum 
machine and the koto, a Japanese 
stringed instrument. As expected, 
JuraSiic S's fresh sound, their lyri-
cal talent and supreme beat makers 
made for an experience that will 
not be forgotten. 

The most disappointing part o( 
the show was not the performance 
but the audience. 

The crowd came to 4th & Blast 
year because it fully appreciated the 
artists, the music and the under-
ground. This year's fans did not 
come because they were hyped 

could disappoint. The Word of 
Mouth Tour gave insight to old 
fans and newbies into the way hip-
hop is supposed to be and was a 
good vehicle for delivering the 
extraordinary talent and innovation 
of the performers.

VBall: 
Tritons look to regain 
midseason form 

season match indicated, the 
UCSD squad can hold its own 
against these celebrated oppo-
nents. 

conun. .. ".. ..... 24 
The Thitons will look to their 

leaders to spur their play in the 
tournament, as it will take an 
inspired effon to progress into the 
next round of action. Their chief 
nemesis will be tournament 
favorite Cal State Los Angeles, the 
undefeated squad that breezed 
easily through regular season play. 
[t should be noted, however, that 
the Tritons gave the Eagles their 
most arduous challenge of the sea-
son, as they were the only team to 
battle CSULA to a full five-set 
match. 

CSULA, which is ranked sec-
ond overall in Division II, will be 
led by middle hitter Linda Sauce-
do, who was recently named the 
2000 California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Women's Volleyball 
Player of lhe Year. She led the 
explosive Ea~le attack with a .398 
hitting percentage, a team-high 87 
blocks and an impressive 27 ser-
vice -aces. She was also elected to 
the A11-CCAA First Team, along-
side a conference-high four Eagle 
teaml1!ates, while her coach. Bill 
Lawler, was selected as CCAA 
Coach of the Year. 

The Thitons would definitely 
have their work cut out for them 
in this contest, but as the earlier 

The Tritons will do so with their 
own battalion of acclaimed ball-
spiking stalwans, as CSULA is not 
alone in garnering conference-wide 
accolades. Many of UCSD's out-
standing performers were also rec-
ognized by the CCAA and will be 
making their presence felt in the 
tournament. Junior Laura Santerre, 
who excelled all season for the Tri-
tons, was elected to the AII-CCAA 
First Team for her dominating play, 
while fellow Thitons Leslie Punelli 
and Christine Kueneman were 
elected to the second team. All 
three will surely have an impact for 
the Tritons on the floor in the tour-
nament. 

The Tritons look to build on 
their proud postseason history in 
this. their first CCAA Division " 
tournament. The ~omen's volley-
ball team has built a fine tradition 
of playoff excellence, as the Tritons 
were outstanding in championship 
play at the Division [[[ level. They 
appeared in the tourrrament a 
whopping 19 times, taking home 
the first-place championship tro-
phy in seven of those competitions 
and took the runner-up spot five 
times. UCSD looks to expand on 
those winning ways in this year's 
tournament, and will hopefully 
continue to uphold the tradition at 
this more prestigious level of com-
petition . 

Early Registration Irks 
Some Students at Iowa 
. IOWA C[TY, Iowa - Every 
semester, a number of Iowa stu-
dents find themselves nervously 
waiting for the moment when the 
university will allow them to regis-
ter and find out if there are any 
seats left in their desired classes. 
But while they wait, student ath-
letes are already signed up. 

For the 2001 spring semester, as 
with every semester, student ath-
letes will receive priority registra-
tion beginning on Nov. 20. All ath-
letes are given the opportunity to 
register during the first thn:e days 
of registration, along with profes-
sional students, graduate students 
and any undergraduates who have 
earned 90 hours or more semester 
hours. 

What has some students con-
cerned is that any athlete, regard-
less of year or credits earned at 
the university, may have the 
chance to enroll before a student 
who has earned more semester 
hours. 

U[ freshman Patrick Drouin 
watches as athletes fill up seats up to 
11 days before he is allowed to regis-
ter. 

"It's not fair that athletes have 
the priority above the other stu-
dents who are here for the acade-
mics; he said. "[f anything, the stu-
dents who are academically sUCJ 
cessful should be given the priority 
above the others." 

But in fact, students on academ-
ic scholarship from the UI do 
receive priority registration. These 
students are an example of those 
on campus who receive as much 
priority as a student athlete, said 
Carol Gruber, the director of stu-
dent services in the Athletics 
Department. 

UI senior Jessica Smith said she 
has experienced some problems 
enrolling in classes because they 
were typically crowded with ath-
letes. 

"[ think it is a problem," said 
Smith, who splits her time 
between three jobs and her class-
es. "I think the university should 
consider the people who have to 
work and the peoplc who are pay-
ing for their own tuition with their 
personal money. I've had a hard 
time getting into popular classes 
such as ~elaxation Techniques 
and Health for Living because 

they were usually full, and I had to 
wait two or three semesters to get 
those classes. 

"I've ended up getting the class-
es I wanted, but it was because I 
was running around and talking to 
the teachers and my counselor. [t 
hasn't been because of anything 
the university has done: 

Gruber said that although she 
cenainly empathizes with students 
such as Smith who are required to 
put in long work hours as well as 
study hours, a student athlete 's 
commitment to the university is 
more formal. 

"Those students are not 
responsible to the university; she 
said. "They have not made or 
signed a contract with the univer-
sity as the student athlete has. 
Student athletes sign a contract 
that has them agree to represent 
the university and meet a ll the 
requirements they face to be suc-
cessful in athletics and acade-
mics." 

U[ senior Jake Wilson, who com-
peted this fall as the No. 1 singles 
player for the men's tennis team, 
said most students have the wrong 
idea about the registration rules. 

"' think it's pretty fair because 
our practice times are set in stone; 
he said. "While other students may 
have to schedule their classes 
around a job. they can ask their 
bosses to switch their schedule. But 
when you have to be at practice 
from noon to 5:30 p.m. every day, 
no matter what, it takes away your 
options for classes." 

Travel also comes into play 
when athletes register for classes, 
Gruber said. 

"Student athletes are responsi-
ble for academics and athletics, 
and scheduling around traveling 
times helps them handle their 
responsibilities in both areas. 
which is very important to us," she 
said. 

Wilson, a psychology major, 
said he plans to focus on sports 
psychology because ' he has been 
exposed to sports his entire life, 
and this may be a reason that ath-
letes have sports-related majors. 

"Athletes may just have those 
majors because they are very famil-
iar with athletics and it is a big pan 
of their lives; he said.

BBaII: 
UCSD confronts State in 
season opener 
C-...... "..,...U 
D-llievel: Lanthier said. ·We will 
have to adjust to the more physi-
cal style of play and make other 
adjustments as the season goes 
on." 

The adjustment made by the 
freshman players will be especially 
important to the llitons' chances 
on the coun. 

·We have a lot of freshman 
players this year, but they are all 
quality playm and have the ability 
to make big strides this season; 
Lanthier said. ·We call it the 'fresh-
man factor: which is the ability of 
these guys, who will be given 
opponunities to mature and play, 
to make an impact." 

The llitons open their season 
with a throwdown versus cross-
town rival San Diego State. The 
Aztecs are one of three Division I 
teams that UCSD wiu face this sea-
son in lisht of its jump to Division 
ll. ·Playlng the Division I teams 
will make this advancement all the: 
more easier; Lanthier said. 

·Out of our five non-CCAA 
games, three will be against Divi-
sion I teams, which I think will help 
us out in our move to Division ll; 
he said. · Playing these very good 
teams will not only make us better 
as a team but will also make it eas-
ier to face the Division II teams 
with the added experience of play-
ing some of the rop competition 
around." 

Nor are the benefits of facing off 
against SDSU lost on Lanthier. 

·Playing San Diego State is really 
a no-lose situation for us," he said. 
"Even if we don't win the game, it's 
great for the community and for us 
to be able to get some valuable expe-
rience in a nice atmos'phere." 

The Tritons will begin their 
quest for experience Saturday night 
at 7 p.m. at San Diego State's Cox 
Arena . Make your way down Inter-
state 5 to Interstate 8 and check out 
UCSD as it looks to put the smack 
down on those rascally Aztecs and 
prepare for its inaugural Division II 
season.

In the pool he is able to go inside 
or outside with equal effective-
ness. 

Important in the tournament is 
the performance of goalie Glenn 
Busch. So far, he has had a very 
good year, but he will have to be at 
the top of his game in Honolulu 
to help the Tritons make it 
through. 

Most vital to the Tritons is that 
they play as a team in the tourna-
ment. Harper has repeatedly 
stressed this point during the sea-
son. Each part of the team must 
work together in order for UCSD 
play up to its potential. 

Eight teams from the 12-team 
WWPA will compete at the Hon-
olulu tournament. 

The Tritons are the highest~ 
ranked team in the WWPA and are 
favorites goi ng into the tourna-
ment. evertheless, competition in 
Honolulu will be tough. For exam-
ple. the U.S. Air Force Academy, 
despite its rank, always fights hard 
for the win, and may be a tough 
match for the Thtons. 

If the Tritons win the tourna-
ment, they will then move on to the 
four-team NCAA tournament. 
The competition will consist of the 
winner of the WWPA, the Eastern 
Conference and the Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation. The last 
spot is an at-large benh, which is 
likely to go to an MPSF team, as 
that division fields multiple top 10 
teams such as Cal, UC Irvin and 
USc. '

Women Swim Team Trounces Bakersfield 
Tritons slap around B~kersfield at will, men not so impressive over weekend action 

Staff Writer 

In a full weekend of swimming, 
the UCSD women's swimming and 
diving team dropped a duel meet 
versus the University of San Diego 
Toreros on Friday, but rebounded 
to beat Cal State Bakersfield on Sat-
urday. 

The men's team fell to Bakers-
field. 

The women's first meet, held at 
USD, consisted of 16 events: two 
diving events, the 400-meter med-
ley relay. the tOOO-meter freestyle, 
the 200-meter freestyle, the 100-

meter backstroke, the100-meter 
breast stroke, the 2000-meter but-
terfly, the SO-meter freestyle, the 
1 OO-meter freestyle, the 200-meter 
backstroke, the 200-meter breast 
stroke, the SOO-meter freestyle, the 
100-meter butterfly, the 200-
meter individual medley and the 
400- and 200-meter freestyle relay. 

The match, which began with a 
hailstorm during warm-ups. did 
not get much better for the Tri-
tons, as USD placed first in 13 out 
of the 16 events. 

"We swam very poorly, and they 
swam well: summarized head 
coach Scott McGihon. "That's pret-

ty much what the match came 
down to." 

However, there was a silver lin-
ing. as sophomore .Jennifer Watan-
abe continued her excellent swim-
ming with a first-place finish in the 
200-meter freesyle event and the 
200-yard backstroke, winning with 
times of 29.86 and 32.76, respec-
tively. The other top finisher for the 
women's team was junior Lindsey 
Meeks in the 100-yard breaststroke 
with a winning time of 31 .80. 

Fortunately for the women, Sat-
urday was a new day, as they domi-
nated Bakersfield, 149-82. 

Junior Molly McCorlde placed

first in both the 100- and 200-yard 
backstroke. while Watanabe and 
Sharon Smith were individual win-
ners. At the end of the day, four 
freshmen had qualified for the 
NCAA meet at the end of the year. 

The men's swimming team was 
unfortunately unable to come up 
with a victory, as it was beaten 134-
86 by Cal State Bakersfield. How-
ever, the men's 400-yard freestyle 
relay team, composed of junior 
Christian Deck, sophomore Luke 
Seed, sophomore Danny Fischer 
and senior Rusty Jones impressed. 

"' don't think Ithe relay team 
hasl ever be that fast at this point in 
the year; McGihon said. 

Another bright spot was Triton 
Ryan Long's victory in the 200-yard 
individual medley. 

"His time was exceptionally 
fast: McGihon said. 

Not only was it fast , it was also 
good enough to qualify Long for 
the NCAA finals. 
. While both the men's and 
women's teams ended up with loss-
es after the weekend was over, 
McGihon was still optimistic. 

"' think that the NCAA finals 
ate more important than winning 
dual meets: he said. "And the way 
both the men and women are 
swimming right now, we should 
do good lin the finals]." 

"[In order to improve] we need 
to keep fine tuning. and work on 
starts and turns: McGihon said. 
"However, we are swimming very 
well for this time of the year.· 

The Tritons will have plenty of 
opportunities this weekend to 
improve, as they send their divers to 
the USC Invitational on Friday, and 
then square off against Claremont 
College and UC Santa Cruz on Sat-
urday in Claremont.

Polo: 
Season-ending 
tournament looms large 
ContIIIIIed ,.... ..... 24 
Thtons put other teams on their 
heels and from there they let their 
stellar defense take over. 

'n their mini-slump, they have 
been falling behind early and have 
been going into the late quarters at 
a three or four goal deficit. The Th-
tons then play the teams shot-for-
shot, or even outplay them, but 
their efforts are to no avail, as such 
a big lead is usually too large to 
surmount. 

Why are opposing teams getting 
out and ahead so early? The Th-
tons have been making few mental 
mistakes. They have not been get-
ting back on the counterattack and 
have been letting their opponents 
roam freely. These mistakes were 
not made earlier in the year when 
they were beating the best teams in 
the nation. If the Thtons want to 
compete at the NCAA tournament, 
they will have to stop making those 
mistakes now. 

Many players led the Tritons to 
the WWPA tournament, Jonathan 
Samuels first and foremost. He 
has been an intimidating presence 
for the Tritons all season long and 
gives other teams something to 
worry about. Samuels leads the 
team with 46 goals and has been 
solid all year long. If he has a ~ood 
tournament, the Tritons are likely 
to follow. 

Jason Boettner has been a great 
distributor and defensive presence 
for UCSD. During the regular sea-
son, he dished out 23 assists and 
recorded 26 steals, tops on the 
team. 

Vladimir Djopic has been a 
great asset for the Tritons, as he 
has become a versatile utility man.

Up the Mountain They Go 
In addition to playing SDSU to open the season, the men's 
basketball team will face some serious challenges this year 

. By seem BURROUGHS 
Staff Writer 

It will not be until the UCSD 
men's basketball team steps onto 
the hardwood for the first time 
ever as a California Collegiate 
Athletic Association Division II 
competitor that coach Greg Lan-
thier and his squad will fully know 
what to expect this season. 

"This year will be a year of 
assessment, and we will not really 
know what we need to do to suc-
ceed and make strides until we 
actually play a few games: lan-
thier said. "We will be adjusting to 
a whole new game, one that is 
more physical and more athletic, 
with bigger, faster players. We are 
going to go out and play and rec-
ognize our weaknesses and look 
to improve on them. But we will 
not know what they are until we 
play." 

The CCAA Ranking Commit-
tee, composed of league coaches, 
appears to recognize quite a few 
weaknesses in the Triton team, 
ranking them dead last (tied with 
San Francisco State), for 11 th out 

, of the 12 CCAA teams. The Gold-
en Eagles from Cal State Los 
Angeles. who tied last year for sec-
ond place in the CCAA, received 
six first-place votes to gamer the 
No. 1 pre-season seed. 

Defending CCAA champions, 
Cal State San Bernadino was 
ranked second, with traditionally 
solid Cal State Bakersfield third 
and six-time NCAA post-season 
participant UC Davis ranked 
fourth . 

The team that went 5-20 last 
season in Division III play has a 

chance to outplay that ranking 
this season, though, and its ability 
to do so will probably hinge on 
the play and progression of its key 
freshman players. 

The 1 S-member Triton team is 
composed of ten freshmen - four 
true freshmen and six red shirts. 
Ryan Swed, a true freshman out of 

"This season will be a 
season of development 
for us, as we know we 
need to get bigger, faster 
and stronger, but there 
will also be many other 
things that will need to 
be done for us to be 
competitive and succeed 
at the D-JJ level," 

- ............. 
Men's Basketball Head Coach 

Tempe, Ariz., will definitely be 
looked to by Lanthier to make a 
contribution, as will Roger Curtis 
and Ryan Rikansrud. Out of the 
six red shirts, Cameron Jackson, 
the 6-foot-1 -inch guard out of 
Tustin High, will be an impact 
player for the TIitons this year. 

. "Cameron is the top of the 
class among the freshman guys, 
he is an exceptional player, and 
will start for us and get a lot of 
playing time: Lanthier said. 

Erik Ramp, the 6-foot-I-inch, 
200 pound guard, whom Lanthier 
describes as a very big, very phys-

ical and very athletic player, will 
also get a lot of looks if he can 
come back from his recent knee 
surgery. Mike Roberts and C.j. 
Duffaut will also challenge for 
time for the TIitons this year. 

Of the returning players, the 
Tritons will once again look to 6-
foot-6-inch forward Sam Higgins, 
the three-year starter, who aver-
aged 15.4 points per game and 4.8 
rebounds per game last year, while 
compiling 61 three-pointers over 
the duration of the season. Joining 
him on the floor will be the team's 
sole junior, Nick Christenson, a 
6-foot-2-inch guard, who aver-
aged 9.2 points and 3.0 assists per 
game last season, and S-foot-11-
inch senior guard Michael Mar-
tin, who averaged 9.9 points and 
2.6 assists per game. Sophomore 
center Clark Goolsby, who at 6 
feet 7 inches, 220 pounds is the 
Tritons' biggest player, will also be 
a key element in the Tritons' suc-
cess this season. 

These returning players will be 
looked to for leade.rship on and 
off the court this season by the 
young Triton team, as leadership 
will be very important to a team 
that not only lacks experience, but 
is also making the jump to Divi-
sion II play. That is why this sea-
son will be a period of adjustment 
for the blue and gold. 

"This season will be a season 
of development for us, as we 
know we need to get bigger, 
faster and stronger, but there will 
also be many other things that 
will need to be done for us to be 
competitive and succeed at the

S~y 

BILL BURGER 

A II of Chicago is abuzz these days with talks about the Cubs trading their 
brightest star. outfielder Sammy 
Sosa. to the Texas Rangers. 

Fans are outraged, and Cubs 
owner Andy MacPhail, trying to 
maintain some semblance of con-
trol , keeps lying through his 
teeth, saying that no trade will be 
made. . 

The trade would likely be a 
five-for-one swap, with the Cubs 
getting players such as outfielder 
Gabe Kapler, relief pitcher Jeff 
Zimmerman Ruben Mateo and 
possibly additional minor league 
prospects. 

From the Cubs' point of view, I 
think this would be a steal. They 
have so many holes that Sosa can 't 
possibly fill them all by himself. A 
big trade for their star might have 
a similar effect on them as the 
trading of Herschel Walker had on 
the Dallas Cowboys back in 1989. 
That trade was directly responsi-
ble for bringing Troy Aikman and 
Emmitt Smith to the team, the 
duo tha t caused the Dallas 
dynasty in the 1990s. 

This kind of affect was also felt 
by the Colorado Avalance when 
they traded Eric Lindros and 
recieved draft picks that would 
eventually produce Peter Fors-
berg. 

That said, should the Cubs 
make the deal? Yes. That is, if Sosa 
wants them to make it. 

First of all, because Sosa has 
been in the major leagues for 10 
years and spent the last five of them 
with the same team, he has the 
power to block any proposed trade. 
Trying to trade him somewhere he 
doesn't want to go would be futile. 
More importantly, the Cubs owe it 
to Sosa to send him somewhere 
that he wants to go. 

When Sosa hit 66 home runs in 
1998, and again the following year 
when he hit 63, he virtually car-
ried the Cubs and all of baseball 
on his back. The Major Leagues 
were still reeling from the strike 
that wiped out the 1994 World 
Series, and Sosa, with the help of 
Mark McGwire. brought baseball 
back from the brink of utter cata-
strophe. 

The way that Sosa and McG-
wire composed themselves 
throughout the race to knock 
down Roger Maris' immortalized 
single-season home run record was 
both an honor to watch and a tes-
tament to the character of the two 
men. 

So now it is time to pay Sosa 
back. The only problem is that 
nobody seems to know what he 
wants to do. Last season, he basi-
cally demanded a trade, and later in 
the year he said he wanted to end 
his career, where he started, in 
Texas. 

Sammy, it makes it hard for 
people to honor you by doing your 
will when you can't resolve what it 
is. 

When Sosa finally decides what 
he wants, it should be given to him 
with haste. Baseball and the Cubs 
owe him at least that much .

Water polo seeks an NCAA berth at WWPNs Championships 
By TAIT MIUER 

~~---------------Associate Sports Editor 

Men's water polo has endured 24 games this 
year. All its trials and tribulations - from beat-
ing then-No. 1-ranked Cal to its disappointing 
performance at the Northern California Tour-
nament at Stockton - will be for naught if it 
does not perform well this weekend at the West-
ern Water Polo Association Championships in 
Honolulu. 

The winner of the tournament will get an 
automatic berth in the NCAA tournament, held 
Dec. 2 and 3 in Malibu, and a chance to play in 
the national championship. 

Coached by Denny Harper, the Tritons start-
ed off the season on an incredible tear, winning 
15 of their first 18 games and attaining a rank-
ing as high as fifth in the nation . Since then, the 
team has been i!1 a mini-slump, losing five of its 
last seven games, but is still ranked eighth in the 
nation. 

The Tritons are not losing to just anybody, 
as all of their losses have come against excel-
lent teams. They' have fallen to CSU Long 
Beach twice, and to Cal, UC Irvine and Pep- . 
perdine once. These teams are in the top 10 
nationally. 

What made the Tritons so successful earlier 
in the season was their ability to jump on teams 
quickly. By aggressively taking an early lead. the Lyon Uew / Guard;.,

Volleyball hopes to regain its midseason 
form in time for its first appearance in 
the NCAA Division II Tournament

Despite a disappointing final 
weekend, the Tritons are headed 
to their first-ever Collegiate Ath-
letic Association Division" Pacif-
ic Regional Championships, to be 
held starting today at the Eagle's 
Nest in Los Angeles. 

Its slight meltdown over the 
course of its last two regular sea-
son games could not overshadow 
the team's stellar season-long 
achievements, which have gar-
nered the Thtons a sixth-seed 
placement in the tournament. 
The tournament will be conduct-
ed on a 48-team field for the first 
time in the history of the NCAA 
Division (( championships. The 
host squad, Cal State Los Ange-
les, locked down the first seed by 
compiling an undefeated 30-0 
season, with 22 of those victories 
coming in CCAA action. CSU 
San Bernadino, due.to those cru-

cial. final UCSD losses, overtook 
the Tritons to tie for second place 
and pick up the third and founh 
seeds. Hawaii Pacific, with the 
second seed, and Seattle Pacific, 
with the fifth seed, round out the 
Pacific Regional field. 

The Tritons will first see 
action versus season-long archri-
val Cal State Bakersfield, one of 
the teams that overcame the 1I'i-
tons in the final weekend, thwart-
ing UCSD's high seed hopes. 
Bakersfield captured the first two 
meetings of the seasons between 
the teams, each in four sets. If it 
can overcome the Roadrunners in 
this initial match, UCSD will go 
head-to-head with second-
ranked Hawaii Pacific in semifinal 
play. The finals will be held on 
Saturday at 7 p.m .• with the win-
ner advancing to the Division " 
Elite Eight. which will begin play 
Nov. 30.

Women's soccer continues to roll, will 
face a team from Central Oklahoma on 
Sunday in the NCAA Quarterfinals 
By ROIIIRT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's soccer 
team just keeps rolling along, and 
one question remains: "Just how 
far can this team go?" 

Apparently as far as they want 
to go, considering the tear they 
have been on lately. 

In its first year at the Division" 
level. UCSD sports an 18-2 record 
and a California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Championship. 

The team is also currently 
riding a 14-game winning 
streak. 

The Thtons will put all of that 
on the line this weekend when 
they face off against Central 
Oklahoma in the NCAA Division 
" women's soccer quanerfinals 
at home. 

The Thtons downed SOJloma 
State 2-0 in the first rou'nd to 
reach this stage. Central Okla-
homa squeaked by Mesa State of 

Colorado 1-0 in double over-
time for this showdown with 
UCSD. 

Central Oklahoma, from 
Edmon, Okla., looks to be a for-
midable opponent. It is ranked 
sixth in the nation and boasts a 
record of 21-2. This is the first-
ever Division II post-season 
appearance for the Broncos. who 
breezed through the Lone Star 
Conference with a 7-0 record. 

The Thtons, who are dominat-
ing opponents in every facet of 
the game, are not to be intimated. 
After capturing five national 
championships at the Division Ill. 
level, UCSD is having similar 
success during its first year at the 
Division" level. 

The game is at 1 p.m. on Sun-
day. General admission is $4, stu-
dents are 52. seniors only a buck 
and children 12 and under are
