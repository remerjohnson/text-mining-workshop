AAAAAGGGGGHHIllIHH!!!!! I 

The annual report , re l ea~eu earlier thl ~ week. 
det:lIls 62 attempted anu/or !> uccessful vehi cle 
theft s on campus dunng 11)96. In 1995, there 
were 92 allempted and/o r succe~~ fulthe rt s. uown 
aga ll1 from a high of 142 theft s in 1994 . 

The 62 vehicles stolen dunng 1996 n:prese nt 
the lowest numher of auto theft s since 19H6. 

J enkin~ suggested the decrease was rclateu 
to the public's knowledge of the problem, and 
an Increased usc of anti -theft device~ . 

"People arc taking control of and responsI-
bility for their cars," Jenkins sa id . ''I'd like to 
think that people who park there lin the UCSD 
parking lots / care about their vehicles and are 
utilizing some sort of security." 

Jenkins also credited the U SO police, who 
"have made some good arrests." 

The values of the vehicles stolen over the 
past year averageu $ 11 ,360. and the dollar loss 
through vehicle theft for the year totalleu 
$704 ,334. 

On average, 24,205 vehicles wereon campus 
each day and fi ve vehicles were stolen every 
month . 

The most acti ve month for UCS D ca r thieves 
was November, when 13 cars vanisheu from 
campus. Twel ve vehicles di sappeareu in Octo-
ber, but Jenkins said any number of reasons 
coulu be behind the Increase. 

"A lot of times If we ha ve a big lI1l: rea~e . II

Ing our area." Jenk ins sa id . 

Je nkins saiu another rea~on lor the increase 
of car theft s could ha ve been the upcoming 
holidays. 

"Thieves know that during winterhreak then.: 
will be few vehicles for them to target. The 
increase could be uue to thi eves taking au van-
lage of one last opportunity." Jenk ins ~a id . 

The most fre quently targeted make~ of ve-

UCSD Psychology Dept. Study Shows Tickling is Not Funny 
RESEARCH: Tickling 
and humor do not 
cause arne emotions 
By Ya-lel Yang 
Staff Writer 

In order to di cover why people 
smile, laugh or even squirm when 
tickled, a team of UCSD psycholo-
gist recently completed a study that 
begins to reveal the true nature of 
th is sensation. 

"Even though tickling seem light 

hearted, almost silly, people have 
wondered about it for a long time," 
said Christine Harri s, a UCSD p y-
chology graduate student who, along 
with Assistant Professor ofPsychol-
ogy NicholasChristenfeld, proposed 
two of the studies on ti ckling. 

The subject group of the lirst test 
consisted of 72 undergraduate stu-
dent between the age of 18 and 41 , 
48 of whom were female and 24 
were male. 

The group was di vided into 
thirds. The lirst group viewed a 14-

minute video of stand-up comedy 
fro m "The Best of Saturuay ight 
Live." Afterward , each was tickled 
by a research ass istant. 

The second group was ti ckled 
fi rst and then was shown the video, 
while the third was shown a nature 
video and then ti ckled. 

Subjects were ti ckled in various 
places, ranging fro m the bottom of 
the foot, to parts of the torso. to the 
wri sts and palm . The researcher 
then measured the time the subjec t 
pent laughing, mil ing, wiggling 

or asking for the ac ti vity to end. 
The ~tudy supports the as!>ulllp-

tion that smiling and laughter de-
rived from humor ha~ little in com-
mon with the sallle fee lings caused 
by tickling. 

"People want to know why we 
laugh anu Sill I Ie even though most 
report th ey don' t like it. " 
Chri tenfcld sa id . 

The study supports the view that 
tickling and humordo not share the 
same underlying emotion. For in-

Goldfish is an in-

The lead singer even went so far 
as dancing with the audience. 

'These lots, located close to 
Genesee and Torrey Pines, are easy 
targets because the streets near the 
campus lead directly 10 major free-
ways like the 'S' and the 'IS: both 
of which allow for easy getaways," 
Jenkins said. 

According to Jenkins, chances 
are very good that the owner of a 
stolen ca r wi II recover his vehicle. 
However. recovery rate is slowly 
declining. due to the increasing 
competence of theft rings. 

"Recovery rates are historically 
very high, but they are going down 
because vehicles arc worth more as 
parts," Jenkins said. "Also. thief

I\. San Diego Superior ourt judge is expcctcd to rule 
in mid-Fehruary whether the whole of the Chargers' $78-

Spilit Night Adds Cheer to 
an Otherwise Dreary Friday 

Last Friday saw tile cddmltion of Spirit Nigh t, 
UCSD's annua l attempt to promote school spiri t and 
unity. While thl! rally has been held for many years now, 
thl.: Guardiall salutes the (kdicated individuals who take 
the time every year to help organize or part icipate in the 
..:vent. Thes..: peop le do the campus a treme ndous service 
hy d\.:voting a portion of their free t ime to make UCSD a 
more fun and e nthusias ti c p lace 10 be. 

Spi rit Night a lso g ives members of the five colleges a 
cha nce to get togethe r and engage in a little healthy com-
pl:tition . This year, over 1,300 students a ttended the 
event and represented their colleges in various competi-
tions and raffles. Muir st udents, who ran in to the 
RIMAC Arena with the theme from " Braveheart" blaring 
from the loudspeakers, won this year's competition, 
demonstrating what it means to have spirit. 

But it wasll't only Muir slLldcnts who show..:d treme n-
dous spi ri t. St udents from all the ot her colleges along 
with U SD's Pl!P Band, c hl!erlcaders and dance team 
cheered both men 's and women\ basketball teams to 
victory. 

U D Illay have a well -d\.:servcd reputation for being 
a university devoid of sl.: hool spirit and things to do, but 
by participating in events like , pirit Night, dedica ted stu-

During the prote~t , Guardian 
photographer Yakov ZolOiorev 
took a piclure of four MEChA 
members standing over a hurning 
U.S . llag. The pictured MEChA

The truth is that modem -day

inconsi stency. AI its core. its 
eKhortation to the faithful to " take 
pride in thei r indigenous history"

loyal and quickly-growlI1g follow-
ing. 

Tht: ViclOrvi lIe - has~lI pu n k 
band brought ils 11I gh-~ncrgy ael 
and posilive message 10 SOMA 
Live lasl Frida y, where Ihey 
qui ' kly lIi spelied any doubls con-
cerning their punk-rock credihi li -
ty. 

Fifteen minules aher opening-
band Ihe Mr. T Expcnem:e left the 
stage, a face to fal:e banner 
unfurled behind the drum kit and a 
buzz circulated throughout the con-
cert h,,11. 

The band lIidn 't waste any ti me 
with ils large audient:e , launt:hing 
into "Eve rything 's Your Fault ," 
Ihe instant SOMA Live owner 
Len Paul finished announcing 
the m. 

The band played four songs 
before Slopping, al which point 
lead singer Trever Keilh told Ihe 
crowd, ''We're going to Iry and 
play 25 songs lonighl. Do you wan I 

us toT' 
The audience agreell, 

and they almost got their 
wi sh. The band playcd 
virtua lly every song off 
of its latest se lf-titlell 

relea~e, as well a, a 
numhe r of old ,ong 
from its previous 
alhum s, DOIl 't T/lrn 

AII'ay, Ol'er I t and Big Ch(I ic£'. 
Included among these pieces wa, 
Ihe 1995 radio hit . "Disco nncct-
eu.' · 

The slylisti ' di rferem:es 
hetween Ihe older albums and Ihe 
new album were clearly evidenl -
the fonncr consisled of simpler, 
harder punk while the new albulll 
showcases a more mature. melodic 
side 10 Ihe band, adding elemenls 
of conventional , old-fashioncd 
rock and roll. One blalant example 
of thi s is heard in "Blind," a Billy 
Joel-meets-Social Distonion rock 
anthem. 

This new twist to face 10 face's 
music reaches out to listeners out-
side of Ihe punk -rock circle while 
maintaining the raw intensity thai 
altracted some of Iheir die -hard 
followers . 

Keith and his bandmales dis-
played powerful energy while 
shouling out their positi vely-
charged songs and con lantly 
acknowledged Iheir fans. At one 
poinl during Ihe show, Keilh pulled 
a kid out of the audience, inlro-
duced him 10 the olher band mem-
bers, and in vited him 10 sing along 
on the song , "You've Done oth-
ing." 

The cnthuslasti, audience nm, 
jumped, Illoshed and sang along 
wit h c~l.:ry song. The band Idt the 
slage aftcr ab\)ut 18 songs, hut 
qUlckl relurned to (k li ght the 
fans . plaYing a short ~ncore that 
featured an instrumcnlal ~urf­
musIc 'ong. 

The fan, may not ha\'e gOllen 
their 25 song., hUI face to face pre-
senteu them with a sonic assault 
Ihal Icftlhclll bruised, ballered and 
emotionally uplifted. 

Opening Ihe show was 22 Jacks, 
a new L.A.-based band Ihal is gar-
nering nalional critical acclaim 
wilh its debut album, Uncle Bob. 

Comprised of memhers of 
well -known punk groups Wax, 
The Adole cents and No Use For 
A Name, the band allempted 10 
prime Ihe crowd wilh its melodic 
power-pop. 

Despite the band 's talent and the 
quality or the songs, Ihey were ill-
received by Ihe audience, which

largely stood in place throughout 
Ihe scI. 22 Jacks themsclves also 
failed to display a lot or energy, 
except ror rrontrnan Joe Sib 's 
ceaseless bouncing and facial 
expressions. 

The band played l1Iost or Ihe 

songs ofT Ullele Bob, as well as an 
impressive cover of The Police's

*** 

Crumbox fu ses what has come 
to be known as the "San Diego 
sound" together with Los Angele, 
noise and a pop-punk edge from 
North Carolina on the fo ursome '). 
debut full-length album, Resident 
f)ouble U, released on Ti me 
Bomb Recordings. 

Young indi e-rock anti-stars 
such as Superchunk, J Church 
and Small have all been named as 
influences on the sound resonant 
on Crumbox. All 12 tracks of 

Resident Double V, similar to 
other ind ie-core recordings, arc 
saturated with hard-driving, com-
manding guitars that guide the 
me lodic and ant hemic voca ls 
th roughoul each and every song. 
Although Ihis parlicular formula 
ca n he traced th roughout the 
album, Residell! Double V 
remai ns a sublime co llaborallon. 

Aside from nalural ta lenl , Ihe 
mastery of Crumbox's album can 
also he attributed 10 the produc-
tion skill of Mark Trombino l)f 
Ihe San Diego band Drive Like 
Jehu. 

The heavy showcasing of gUI-
tars re mams a trademark ofTrom-
bino 's and IS delini tely evidcnl on 
Residellt DOl/iJle U. 

Crum box can also be heard on 
their 7 inch relcased on Calapul t

dents more entertaining ways to spend 
their free time, but by also fostering a 
sense of school spirit. Needless to say, 
this spirit is currently dead, or at least 
on a decades-long sabbalical at an-
other school. 

How great would it be to be able to 
see another person wearing a UCSD 
sweatshirt at some mndom location 
like the bevemge aisleofRalph' s and 
give him a high-five while saying, 
"How about toose Tritons - what a 
game last night," and not get a look 
that says, "Are you deranged"?" 

Financial benefits would abound 
as well. Cal Berkeley and UCLA do 
not get many times our level of alumni 
donations just because they are older 
and located in the Bay Area and Los 
Angeles, respe<.:tively. Their alumni 
feel an attachment to their respective 
alma maters every time they watch a 
game on TV at the local sports bar. 
debate the merits of their respective 
teams wilh weenies from USC, or sec 
the score of a game involving their 
respecti ve schools on the II o'clock 
news. And these feelings translale 
into higher donations l'or the schools. 

More lei urc activities, more 
money, more exposure - just plain 
·more. A move up to D-I would be 
good for everybody. Well, atmost 
everybody. Onc linal disclaimer: while 
J can' t guaranlee a wedgie-free en vi-

. moment, I' m sure that any wcdgics 
meted out would be richl y deserved. 

SPIKE: Coach IS 
jack of all trades 
Continued frpm page 18 

" It's going 10 be quite an experi -
ence to fnce I SDSU I in our fi nal 
home match of the year:' McFarl and 
said. "\ still have SO I11I! connections 
wi th the program over there." 

Prior 10 joining on at UCSD. 
McFarl and enjoyed a sliccessful ten-
ure at Palomar College. At UCSD, 
he was origi nally hired 10 fi ll only 
Ihl! woml!n's posi tion, hul ancr the 
vacancy of Ihe men', job and the 
succcs,ful run in hi, lirst se;\son 
with the Wllmen, Ihe athleti c depa rt-
ment de..:i ded th ai they had 'found 
I he Ii I!hl coach for the job. 

So~ for, McFarland has not di sap-
pointed. After win ni ng his fi r,1 
malch <lIthe reins of the men's squad, 
he bJ the Tritons to the Mecca of 
volleyhall. Hawaii . UCSD pl ayed 
the n. 3 Rai nbows tough in two 
ga ml!s. showing they can hang with 
a top-ranked volleybaJI squad . 

With ' a combinati on of veteran.. 
experience and youthful athleticism, 
the Tritons ha ve shown I hat they arc 
'capable of being competiti ve aga i nst 
Di vision I opponents. If all goes 
tvkFarland's way, this year will see 
the first Division III men's National 
Champion crowned in volleyball. 

"The learn has decided that the 
National Championship i our ulti-
mate goal," McFarland said. "I think 
lhat playing Division I schools will 
only get us prepared ." 

The new kid in town has found 
hi s niche at UCSD. He has ex-
ceeded expec tations and is now ' 
aiming ·toward bigger and beller 
things, including a Nationat Cham-
pionship.

NEW KID

Fo~r.P'·4S 7.3334 

The UCSD Guardian 

Above: McFarland can often be 
found near a volleyball, exhibiting 
the skills that helped San Diego 
State to a men 's national champi-
onship back in 1973. 
Left: McFarland spends much of 
his time on the phone regarding 
schedules and fundrais ing as part 
of his responsibilities as head 
coach of the men 's and women's 
volleyball team s at UCSD. 

Thursday, January 30, 1997 

Duncan McFarland finds 
himself at the helm of both 
UCSD volleyball squads 

magine being the new kid in 
town. 

Normally, with thi s dis-
ti nc tion comes the requisi te 
time spent struggling to lind 

friends, worki ng to Ii tin and hop-
ing to succeed in a newfound city. 

The same cou ld be said for a 
new coach. You are challenged Lo 
live up to expectations, forced Lo 
communicate with a new set of 
players, each with his or 
her own idea of what a 
coach should be like, while 
constantly struggling to 
stay anoat under the tidal 
wave of a new environ-
ment. 

Now suppose that you 
are hired to be a new head 
coach aL UCSD, a university that 
has produced dozens of National 
Championships and countless AII-
Americans. 

To make mailers even more dif-
ficult, suppose you are hired as the 
head coach for both the women's 
and men 's volleyball teams. 
Expec tatio ns double for a program 
in which the women are a perenni-
altop-five team in Division III and 
the men are forced to playa sched-
ule loaded with the best Division J 
squads that the country has to offer. 
The weight or" these expectation 
would be heavy for any coach to 
bear. 

Apparently UCSD has found a 
head coach able to handle the pres-
sures o f the situation and succeed. 
Thi s new kid in town, Duncan 
McFarland, has proven that he is up 
to the task , and has continued the 
storied tradition or a Triton volley-
ball dynasty. 

Entering thi yea r 's women's 
volleyhall season, cy nics noted thaL 
any cuach taking o ver a program 
coming o ff a mediocre year and 
fac ing possibl y Lhl! tou ghest 
women's schcdule in Di v lsiun III 
would do best to chalk up the sea-

son as a rebuilding year. 
But McFarland has proven he is 

nOL just any coach. With the 'up-
port of six seniors on his roster, 
McFarland led the women 's team 
to an overall record o f 24-7 and a 
nalional NO. 4 ranking. In the post-
season, the Tritons avenged a regu-
lar-season loss to archrival 
California Lutheran en route 10 
winning the NCAA Western 

Regional Championship 
and advanced to the NCAA 
Quarterfinal s. 

For McFarland, volley-
ball is a way of life. 
Growing up on the sand of 
M anhattan Beach, he only 
needed to step out of his 
door and he was on a court. 

When his high school did not have 
a team, McFarland and a group of 
friends got together and started a 
program that is now one of the 
dominant schools in Southern 
California volleyball. 

After high school, McFarland 
was offered a scholarship to play at 
UCLA. But after a year in junior 
co llege he reali zed he wanted to 
move away from the Los Angeles 
area and instead accepted a ehol -
arship to San Diego State. 

Following a standout coli giate 
career at San Diego State, in which 
he led the Aztecs to their first and 
only National Championship in 
1973, McFarland was able to plllY 
wi th the U .S. National Team before 
entering the coaching ranks. After 
returning to his alma mater as a 
coach , he guided the Aztecs to 
three co nsecutive conference 
championships from 1981 -83. 

T his season as the UCSD men's 
coach, M c Far land will have the 
opportunity tu face his form er 
schooll w ice, wi th the second game 
being the Tritons final match of the 
year at h ome on April 15 at 
RIMAC Arena.

CHRIS SCHREIBER PORTS Division I 

Status or Else 
There has been a lot of 

excitelnent around these parts 
lately concerning UCSD's 
possible move from Division III 
10 Division II. The logic is Ihat 
we've oulgrown our D-III 
competitors in overall size of lhe 
sludent body, quality of facilities 
and in the caliber of the athletes 
we aUract. In short, iI' s time to 
move on to bigger and beller 
things. 

Tritons Let One Get Away 
COLLAPSE: Despite garnering the fi rst two games of the match, UCSD fai led to close the door, 
dropping the fourth game on a controversial non-call as Princeton notched its second win of the year 

J wholehearledly agree with 
this sentiment, excepl for one 
tiny detail : D-II is not enough! 
We' ve got to think on a grander 
scale; allow ourselves to dream 
that crazy dream. That's right

you who are confused about th

hind fo llowing Ihe 
UCSD men's volley-
ball team's dramatIc 
fi ve-game collapse 

against Princeton University. 
[n the paM few matches, the Tri-

tons have hecn pia 'ued by an inability 
to close (Jut a match against an oppo-
nent. After dominating the match by 
winning the fi rst two games, UCSD 
allowed the Tigers to claw their way 
back into contention and take the next 
three games. 

times last night," junior opposite hil-
ter Jon Yarris said. " It was just fini h-
ing at the end of a close malch." 

The Tritons carne out lumping at 
the slart of game three, falling behind 
6-10. Looking for an offensive spark, 
McFarland brought in sophomore Kun 
Seckington 10 take advantage of his 
blistering jump serve. Following an 
ace by Seckington and back-to-back 
stuff blocks by senior Mall Minehan 
and Yarris, the Tritons had rallied 
back to within two points of Princeton. 
The momentum continued to swing 
in UCSD's favor as the squad scored 
three more unanswered points to make 
the score 13-10. Unfortunately, the 
Tritons again lertthe door open and 
the Tigers roared hack 10 take the 
game, 15-13.

at Santa Cruz than in their

won't miss us. 

''The positive of the match is that 
we played well against a very good 
leam and certainly put ourselves in a 
position to beat a good team in three 
straight ga rnes," Triton Head Coach 
Duncan McFarland said. "We need to 
learn how to linish." 

In game four, UCSD again had an 
opportuOlty to send Princeton pack-
Ing with multiple opportunities at 
match point. Up 14-10, it appeared 
that the Tritons had won the match 
after a kill by Yarris clearly hi t the 
Princeton block belore falling out of 
bounds, but the referee fai led 10 call 
the ball out. What should have been

into an opportunity for the Tigers,

Enlering the 

lifth game, UCSD 
continued to look 
like the team to beat. 
With rally scoring, 
in whIch a pOint is 
sco red on eac h 

serve, the Tritons were able to exploit 
their normally strong sideout skills. 
But the Tigers were not about to back 
down and the core see-sawed back 
and forth between the two squads. 
Again, UCSD failed to shut the door 
on the match and Princeton was able 
to fini sh off the Tritons, 15-12. 

At a team meeting following the 
match, UCSD took the opponunity to 
discuss its inahility to linish off a tight 
match. 

"We talked about the fact that we 
can ' t wait for good teams to lose, we 
have to beat them," McFarland said, 
"We were hoping that they would 
make an error or the ref would make 
a call rather than us coming up with 
the clutch play." 

On a positive note, the Tritons 
have found a reliable set of offensive 
weapons in the fo rm of Yarri~ and

and 28 kills re~pcctively .
