Promote 
AIDS Day 
AWARENESS: Groups 
encourage learning about 
the pandemic disease 
By REBECCA WOOD 
Staff Writer 

In recognition of World AIDS 
Day on Wednesday, Student 
Health Services, the Cross 
Cultural Center and the 
International Affairs Group held 
a series of events promoting AIDS 
awareness this week. 

In the Price Center, the names 
of local AIDS victims were read, 
foIlowed by a panel discussion 
Wednesday. An AIDS quilt was 
also on display in Price Center 
Galleries A and B. 

Nancy Magpusao, who works 
in the Cross Cultural Center, said 
that the AIDS quilt displays fami-
ly names and messages to loved 
ones who are living with or have 
died from AIDS. 

Recognition of World AIDS 
Day wiU continue into Thursday, 
when an AIDS panel discussion 
titled "AIDS and Communities of 
Color" will be held in the Cross 
Cultural Center from 4 p.m. to 6 
p.m. 

"It is a way of remembering 
the people who have been affect-
ed by AIDS," she said. 

On Monday, Professor Ian 
Trowbridge and retired U.S. 
Navy Captain Marilyn Anita Day 
discussed the difficulties facing 
regions heavily impacted by the 
AIDS virus. 

The discussion, held at Pepper 
Canyon Lodge, was sponsored by 
the International Affairs Group . 

Trowbridge, who teaches at 
the Salk Institute, said that HIV is 
a pandemic disease and is one of 
the top infectious killers in the 
world. She said that although

Connect Director William Otterson Passes Away 
OBITUARY: Thirteen-year UCSD community member expanded program to benefit small businesses 
By PETE PRATO 

Staff~er 

William W. Otterson, director 
of UCSD COMect, a program 
founded to benefit srnalf start-up 
rompanies, died on Nov. 24, .at 
the age of 69. 

Otterson's role within the 
UCSD community spaMed the 
last 13 years. and in tnat t.ime he 
built COMect into an interna-
tionally renowned program that 
has been studied and modeled 
by organizations located as far 
away as Sweden. 

The UCSD Connect program. 
founded in 1985, links high-tech 
and biotech entrepreneurs with 

the resources they need to suc-
ceed, such as furiding, markets, 
management, partners, support 
services, technology and govern-
ment. 

Shortly after its founding, 
Otterson became director of 
COMect, leading the program to 
enhance regional economic 
development by aiding in lhe 
acceleration of the growth of 
high-tech enterprises in San 
Diego. 

Mary Wolshok, aaeociate vice 
chancellor of Extended Studies 
and Public Programs, where 
Connect is based. said that 
Otterson was instrumental in 
building the program. 

"When UCSD launched its 
innovative program in technolo-
gy and entrepreneurship, we 
knew we needed an energetic, 
successful entrepreneur to create 
something better than a research 
park or incubator," Wolshok 
stated. HWe found Bill 
Otterson." 

Under Otterson's leadership, 
COMect grew from a staff of two 
and a budget of $100,000 to a 
staff of 15 with over 600 mem-
bers and sponsors and a budget 
of over $1.7 million. 

UC Regent Peter Preuss said 
that Otterson affected much 
more than just the growth of this 
program. 

"[Otterson] was the single 
most important influence in 
encouraging our region's 
growth in modem industries," 
Preuss stated. "Whenever there 
was something to be done whicl\ 
could enhance the climate for 
growth, [Otterson) was there. 
He relentlessly worked to make 
San Diego both a better and eas-
ier place to develop the indus-
tries which are important here 
today. I, the family, and all of 
San Diego have lost a great 
friend." 

Chancellor Robert Dynes also 
praised Otterson.

"He was a man of great per-

never allowed his illness over 
many years to affect his life, his

stated. II All of San Diego, not to 
mention UCSD, will be the lesser 
for his loss." 

Otterson was born on March

attended Stanford University,

AIDS: 
Africans refuse to 
talk about diseases 
C ....... "... ..... 1 
AIDS is an epidemic in many 
areas, the most impacted region is 
Sub-Saharan Africa. AIDS is the 
leading cause of death for African 
rnales from ages 25 to 45. 

"Culturally [Africans) do not 
speak about sex or sex-related 
diseases because it is taboo," Day 
said. 

Medical care is often inaccessi-
ble to people living in remote 
areas where there is little educa-
tion about HIV and AIDS, Day 
said. She discussed the specific 
cultural obStacles she had to try 
to overcome. 

Day added that she educated 
people about how the disease is 
contracted and specific preven-
tive measures that needed to be 
taken. She said that the Africans 
shared common concerns and 
misconceptions about the trans-

u.s. Air Force, where he served in 
the computer center at Wright 
Patterson Air Force base. He then 
held positions with Standard 
Computers and mM. 

In addition to his business 
work, Otterson was also active in 
the community and held posi-
tions including board member 
and president of the UCSD 
Cancer Center Foundation and 
chairman of the San Diego 
Council of the American 
Electronics Association. He was 
also a board member of the San 
Diego Regional Economic 
Development Corporation at the 
time ofhis death. 

Otterson was also appointed 
to the Governor's Research 
Council and the Governor's 

mission of the disease through 
saliva and toilet seats. 

HIV and AIDS are often intro-
duced to the remote villages 
when men travel to work in 
urban regions where they may 
engage in sexual activity, possibly 
contracting the disease, and later 
bringing it back to the villages, 
Day said. Some of the men have 
multiple wives and the disease 
can be easily spread among them, 
she added. 

Day served in the Navy for 24 
years and is a registered nurse 
with certification as an HIV 
instructor. Since her retirement 
from the Navy, Day did mission-
ary work in Mexico, Kenya, East 
Africa, Zimbabwe and Ghana. 

Trowbridge discussed treat-
ment medications such as 
Azidothymidine (AZT), which 
can reduce the chances of the 
AIDS virus being passed from a 
mother to her child. He said that 
AZT and other drugs are not 
available and preventive mea-
sures such as condoms are often 
unaffordabl,: to people living in 

The UCSD Guudian 

Council on Biotechnology. 
Otterson's efforts' and devo-

tion brought him a myriad of 
awards, including "Headliner of 
the Year," the UCSD Alumni 
Association Award for 
Distinguished Service to the 
biotechnology community and 
the distinguished 1996 
Entrepreneur of the Year 
Institute's National 
Entrepreneur of the Year Award 
for the Support of Entrepre-
neurship. 

On Wednesday, the Greater 
San Diego Chamber of 
Commerce honored Otterson 
with the Pete Wilson Courageous 
Leadership Award for exemplary 
leadership in service to the San 
Diego region. 

countries like Ghana. 
Trowbridge also discussed the 

three stages of progression of HIV 
to AIDS. He explained that typi-
call)! in the United States this 
happens within seven to 10 years 
but in .areas like Sub-Saharan 
Africa, the disease advances at a 
faster pace. 

Contrary to popular belief that 
the first documented case of AIDS 
was in the early 198Os, 
Trowbridge said the first docu-
mented case was in 1959, afflict-
ing a man living in the Belgian 
Congo region of Africa. The dis-
ease was transmitted through pri-
mate-human contact, according 
to Trowbridge. 

The rate of documented cases 
of HIV is increasing in many 
areas. According to the 1999 UN 
AIDS Programme, approximately 
0.3 percent of the U.S. population 
has HIV. Both Trowbridge and 
Day agreed that in the United 
States today there are an increas-
ing number of women and eco-
nomically disadvantaged minori-
ties living with HIV.

Controversial Ad Questions 
The Role of Advertising 

Generally the Guardian staff does not review the 
advertisements that are submitted to the paper, but this 
week we received a request 10 run an advertisement that 
we felt warranted special attention. Without going into 
any great detail , this advertisement was essentially an 
article attempting to discredit eyewitness accounts of the 
Holocaust and suggesting that the commonly held histor-
ical account of the Holocaust is largely inaccurate. 

After considering the principles involved, the staff 
decided not to run the ad. This editorial is intended to 
discuss the arguments that led to this decision. 

Past Guardiall staff members have voted to run adver-
ti sements and even mUlti-page inserts espousing political 
ideologies. Experience from these past incidents has 
shown that readers often interpret these items as being 
representative of the opinion of the paper, despi te efforts 
made by the Guardian and the advertisers themselves to 
identify these items as paid advertisements. Even if this 
effect is unintentional, we must be mindful of the fact that 
people may see this advertisement and think that it is a 
newspaper article that we in some way condone. 

The Guardian occasionally receives opinion submis-
sions with racist or otherwise offensive subjects. The staff 
entertai ns the possibility of publishing these articles 
because we retain the right to edit them in order to try to 
present the subject as tactfully as possible. Because the 
authors of literature such as the piece in question realize 
that there are few publications that would agree to run 
them as normal articles, they attempt to bypass the edito-
rial process by submitting them as advertisements. We 
have no authority to edit paid advertisements, which is 
unrair to authors who have consented to the editorial dis-
cretion of the newspaper. 

The Guardian, like most other publications, draws a 
strict line between advertiSing and editorial content. 
The two sides do not influence one another under any 
circumstances. The editorial staff has an obligation to 
permit people to exercise their freedom of speech. The 
advertising staff exists to provide advertisers with a 
means of publicizing their product. Advertisements of 
this sort advertise no product, and instead try to use 
advertising as a forum for free speech. As such they 
have the effect of blurring the lines between advertising 
and content, a result that we find unacceptable. 

College newspapers that have run this particular adver-
tisement have defended their decision by claiming that 
they were promoting intellectual debate on campus. That 
is not the role of advertising. That is the role of editorial 
content. Furthermore, the argument that this particular 
advertisement fosters discussion is irrelevant, as this topic 
is not a subject of debate among the general public. 

Finally there were personal considerations. We have 
an obligation as journalists to serve the UCSD communi-
ty. Running an advertisement that we have every reason 
to believe would insult and personally hurt a number of 
our readers would not be fulfilling this obligation in good 
faith. When it comes down to it, we are UCSD students 
first and journalists second. The people who read the 
Guardiall are our peers, our friends and our professors. 

In short, we feel that running this advertisement would 
not be beneficial to the UCSD community, nor would it 
serve the best interests of the journalism profession.

WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
NEEDS IS A STRONG LEADER 

COMMENTARY: Lack of central authority will cost the party the presidency 
By TOMVU 
Staff Writer 

As the new millennium 
approaches, a difficult decision faces 
the American people. Within a year, 
Bill Clinton will step down as presi-
dent of the United States, and our 
nation's next leader will be chosen. 
What makes this election particular-
ly important is the fact that the next 
president will lead this nation into 
the 21st century. 

The choice of candidates will be 
the same as it has been for the last 
170 years, and as it will be well into 
the next millennium: Democrats ver-
sus Republicans. Though I am 
inclined to pick the latter, I won't 
focus on why the Republicans seem 
likely to win this upcoming election, 
but rather why the Democrats are in 
jeopardy of lOSing. 

I'm not here to argue that the 
Republican Party's beliefs are any 
more correct than the Democratic 
Party's - both have some views that 
I disagree with and believe in whole-
heartedly. The reason I believe that 
the next commander-in-chief will be 
a Republican lies not in the 
Democratic Party's beliefs, but rather 
in its leaders' inability to act on these 
beliefs. The party's inept leadership 
has not only further alienated the 
American people from the govem-
ment, but it has also made it that 
much more difficult to win the pres-
idency in the next election. At the 
center of this calamity is President 
Clinton. 

When Clinton and Gore first 
came into office in 1992, they repre-
sented thc prototypical Democrats: 
tax-raising, free-spending liberals. 
After a chaotic first year in office, 
the second year was marred by 
party infighting. Gore butted heads 
with Richard Gephardt, the house 
minority leader, and Clinton jousted 
with Nebraska's very influential 
Senator Bob Kerrey. All the while 
the American people looked on crit-
ically. Two years into the pair's first 
term, the American public, con-

The party's inept leadership 
has not only further 
alienated the American 
people from the 
govemment, but it has also 
made it that much more 
difficult to win the 
presidency in the next 
election. 

cerned with the direction the demo-
cratic leadership was taking the 
nation, passed down a decisive 
decision. As a result of the infight-
ing, Clinton's health care reform bill 
failed miserably on the congression-
al floor and, in addition, the 
Democrats were nearly wiped out 
of Congress during the 1994 elec-
tions. 

Why did the Democrats lose in 
1994? The answer is simple: The 
American people did not see the 
leadership reqUired of a president 
and Congress. It would have been 
more understandable if the president 
and the Congressional leadership 
were of different parties. All the 
American people saw was a weak 
president fighting his own party, not 
achieving his own goals, the goals of 
his party and, most importantly, the 
goals of the nation 

From top to bottom, left to right, 
from the House to the Senate, there 

was - and stiJl is - no binding lead-
ership in the Democratic Party. The 
beliefs are there and are strongly held, 
but there is no single voice espousing 
them. Tom Daschle, the Senate minor-
ity leader, is too obscure to Americans, 
and Gephardt is too busy dealing 
with Republican majority in 
Congress. Clinton, the most obvious 
choice, failed to take control in either 
of his terms. Now, as a lame-duck 
president with a tainted reputation, 
no one is willing to deal with him, let 
alone have him represent the voice of 
the party. This leaves one government 
leader to take on this overwhelming 
task: The country's second-in-com-
mand, Vice President AI Gore. 

Touted as the heir apparent to 
Clinton, Gore has willingly taken the 
torch that was passed to him, 
although now it seems more like a 
candle than a raging flame. Standing 
in Gore's way to the Democratic nom-
ination is basketball great and former 
Senator Bill Bradley. A careful look at 
both candidates reveals how nearly 
identical they are to each other, and 
how neither can fulfill what their 
party needs and this nation requires. 

These two adversaries are more 
alike than they are different. From 
handguns to soft money to the envi-
ronment, both candidates share simi-
lar views. They are actually so similar 
in their views, particularly in regards 
to environmental issues, that the 
major environmental groups have yet 
to give either man their support. 

Ironically, both Gore and Bradley 
attack each other on similar grounds, 
attempting to portray the other as a 
conservative traitor to the 
Democratic cause. Yet, even as each 
man tries in vain not to appear too 
conservative, they also attempt not 
to appear too liberal. Their similar 
political ideas are a detriment to the 
party, particularly if voters do not 
buy into their rhetoric. With such lit-
tle diversity among the two candi-
dates, we can only expect a return to 
the good-old mudslinging that cap-

Looking For The Perfect Major 
COMMENTARY: The pursuit of satisfaction should shape careers 
By KIM HOOPER 
Staff Writer 

Just the other day my best 
friend called me in a wild panic, 
frustrated by the sheer torture of a 
crisis we have all had to endure: 
choosing a major. My friend has 
delayed this decision for four 
years, bouncing around from 
zoology to art history to psychol-
ogy, in the hope that an omni-
scient voice from above will cry 
out with conviction, "this is the 
one!" 

With her parents slowly losing 
their patience and ~g her to 
just choose something6efore they 
have to sell their house to fund 
another four years of tuition, I 
asked her, "Well, what do you like 
to study?" She was offended by 
the simplicity of the question, and 
told me that if she knew the 
answer to that, she wouldn't be 
running up her telephone bill 
calling me. 

After talking to my friend, we 
determined that, all other issues 
aside, she adored anthropology. 
She went as far as to say that it 
fascinated her. I presumed that 
our conversation would end 
there; I would go back to read-
ing/failing asleep, and she would 
waltz down to the registrar 's 
office to declare tlus new major. I 
was satisfied. Then, she whined, 
"But an anthropology major? 
That won't get me the bucks!" She 
laughed. I didn't. I quipped 
something about her going for 
pre-med or pre-law if that was 
her concern. Expecting her to see 
the error of her judgment, I was 
shocked when she agreed that 
being a doctor or a lawyer would 
be a smart decision. 

I do not know why I was so 
surprised. I have heard tons of 
students reject certa~ majors 
because they lack a clearly-paved 
path to wealth. I was once caught 
up in the whirlwind myself, let-
ting concern for my future finan-

cial situation drown out my own 
inner voice. I felt somehow 
incomplete, dissatisfied, and stag-
nant until I finally accepted the 
fact that I had to pursue my 
dream of writing, even if I ended 
up living in a hole in the wall and 
subsisting on canned food. Sure, 
my friend could get through med 
school. I have no doubt in my 
mind that she would be "success-
ful." But, I'm concerned that she 
may lose her fortune with all the 
money she will have to spend on 
Prozac. 

Most prominent amongst 
Generation X is the 
preoccupation with 
money. In our society, 
success is equated with 
our salary. 

When it comes to choosing a 
major, the matter is simple. Often 
times, we make decisions far 
more complex than they have to 
be. Our minds are clouded by 
completely unrelated issues -
what our parents will think, how 
difficult the classes are, how 
many required courses there are. 

Most prominent amongst 
Generation X is the preoccupation 
with money. In our society, suc-
cess is equated with our salary. 
We admire, and try to emulate the 
doctor or lawyer with three cars 
more than we admire the blissful, 
yet struggling,. writer scribbling 
poems on the walls of his or her 
shack. I find this a sickening rep-
resentation of our values. 

This is not to completely disre-
gard the importance of finances. 
College graduates should choose 
a career path with every intent of 
supporting themselves. I'm not 
advocating homelessness and 
holding up cardboard signs that 
read"will work for money." It 
would be naive to deny the sig-

nificance of money. However, it is 
unwise to make the pursuit of 
green pieces of paper the focus of 
one's life. Structuring one's entire 
academic - and post-academic 
- life around the pursuit of the 
all-mighty dollar is like leading a 
horse wearing blinders with a 
carrot dangling from a stick. 
While focusing on that one goal, 
you will miss the scenery along 
the way -learning for the sake of 
learning and discovering your 
own identity and true interests. 
As a wise person told me recently, 
"Don't miss the beautiful colors 
of the rainbow searching for the 
pot of gold." 

This article is not intended to 
criticize those who are wealthy. 
For those who are well-off, but are 
in a field they are Iess-than-pas-
sionate about, I have only sympa-
thy. For those who have stumbled 
upon their fortunes in the midst of 
a pursuit for paSSion, like Steven 
Spielberg and Bill Gates, good for 
them! They prove my point 
because money was, at least ini-
tially, secondary to their interest. 
That enabled them to experience 
true success - a fulfillment of 
their dreams. The money they 
received was just a bonus. 

The frustration that arises 
from choosing a major is that cer-
tainty rarely comes. There are 
those few lucky people who 
knew what they wanted to do 
from the time they exited the 
womb, but most of us have our 
doubts. That's normal. In the con-
fusing fog, it's easy to have the 
monetary rewards associated 
with a particular career be the 
guiding force in the selection of a 
major. But, if happiness is your 
aim, and it should be, clear your 
mind of all those pressures (soci-
etal, parental, etc.) and go with 
your gut. You'll find your way 
eventually. A true love of some-
thing is what builds real, self-sat-
isfying success.

Herbal Remedies May Not Be All That 
COMMENTARY: Unregulated herbal medicines have hidden side effects 
By CASSANDRA PIERCE 
Staff Writer 

Every year Americans spend 
millions of dollars on herbal 
remedies. Three of the most pop-
ular of these herbs are ginsen~ 
ginkgo biloba and St. John s 
Wort. Aside from the fact that 
many scientists can't agree on 
whether or not these supple-
ments actually work, the 
absence of standardization in 
this unregulated industry means 
that many consumers who 
swear by the "remedies" they 
take are not actually taking the 
drug they think they are. Studies 
have shown that about 15 per-
cent of "ginseng" pills contain 
no real ginseng. 

Ginseng's purported effects 
include improving memory, 
endurance, sex and energy, and 
reducing stress. Experiments per-
fonned using ginseng and place-
bos !\ave had mixed results, 
demonstrating no repeatable 
effects. However, some experi-
ments have shown ginseng to 
have antioxidant effects, meaning 
that it fights free radicals. (Atoms 
with at least one unpaired elec-
tron. They are a natural side effect 
of the function of cells, but are 
dangerous to these cells, interact-
ing with them whenever possible 
and effectively "rusting" them.) 

No one can decide what gin-
seng does, if anything. It has the 
few minor side effects you hear 
on most commercials for new 
drugs - the ones that the female 
narrator reads off in a perky, 
smiling voice as if they are really 
desirable: "diarrhea, insomnia, 
nervousness, nausea and vomit-
ing." And, you shouldn't take it 

if you're pregnant or planning to 
be pregnant, which is a good 
rule for all questionable sub-
stances. Or, if you have intestinal 
problems. Or, if you have an 
estrogen-dependent disease like 
breast cancer. Or, if you're taking 
warfarin, a drug ginseng inter-
acts with dangerously. It may in 
fact cause irritability and raise 
blood pressure.

get their act together and consent 
to be regulated by the FDA, they 
can't claim any real effects. In 
addition, they also are not 
required to list side effects and 
drug interactions on their labels. 
The easiest way to ensure the rel-
ative safety (and actual content) 
of any herbal brand is to read up 
on European herbal regulations, 
which are stricter than those in 
the United States. Two brands of 
ginseng that have passed these 
European regulations are Girlsana 
and Pharmaton. 

Ginkgo biloba is touted for 

many of the same unspecified 
functions as ginseng: improving 
mental state and sex and dimin-
ishing free radicals. It also claims 
to improve blood flow, some-

dangerous when compounded 
with garlic supplements, war-

Ginkgo biloba may CQnflict with

effects of these drugs, causing 
spontaneous bleeding or brain 
hemorrhaging. Several cases of 
this type have been reported. 
The usual side effects are gas, 
nausea, vomiting, headaches 
and restlessness. 

Ginkgo biloba does, however, 
seem to hold promise for coun-
teracting the effects of 
Alzheimer's disease, especially 
if the disease is detected early. 
There isn't much information 
about ginkgo, but it does seem 
to improve circulation. Basically, 
as with all herbal remedies, use 
common sense. Unless your doc-
tor suggests you use it, you 
probably don't need it. 

There are a tangle of opin-
ions regarding St. John's Wort. 
Mostly it is suggested for 
depression, but it has also been 
applied to ailments ranging 
from kidney problems and 
bums to AIDS. Some sources 
say clinical studies on the bene-
fits of 51. John's Wort are con-
clusive. Others say they aren't. 
Some tout the lack of side 
effects, while others list pages 
of them. Some claim it works as 
a sunscreen, which is ridiculous 
because when livestock graze 
on it, they become oversensi-

More Professors Wanted 
COMMENTARY: Faculty will nearly double 
By MARC COMER 
Senior Staff Writer 

Forget for a moment that park-
ing on campus is already atro-
cious. Forget that as of next year 
sophomores will no longer be 
guaranteed on-campus housing. 
Forget that San Diego is expected 
to grow by 1 million residents in 
the next 20 years. Forget that 
UCSD is expecting to take-on an 
additional 10,000 students by 
2008. You can even forget that 
finding affordable housing and 
driving the daily commute in San 
Diego is excruciating. 

UCSD is going to have another, 
much more serious problem in 
coming years: providing students 
with the higher education they 
expect from the University of 
California, quality education from 
top-notch instructors. 

As many students have surely 
noticed, classrooms are filling up 
faster, waitlists are longer than 
ever, and more courses are being 
taught in the evening. Students 
dread the first two weeks of 
instruction, not because of the 
workload, but because they often 
find themselves trapped in class-
rooms for two weeks, waiting to 
see if there will be enough avail-
able spots for them to add the 
class. Often the only available seat-
ing is in a dusty aisle. The compe-
tition for classes is getting fierce, 
and the only solution is for all the 
departments to provide more 
classes. . 

The university is pondering 
making summer session a full-
blown quarter in order to increase 
the number of classes it offers. 
But while this idea is being 

LIMITED 

SEATING-

kicked around, a more severe 
problem looms: who is going to 
teach all of these new courses 
when they finally ·are created? 

It is estimated that UCSD will 
need to hire 750 new faculty mem-
bers to accommodate the increase 
of students that will be admitted 
during TIdal Wave 11. There are 
about 1,000 faculty members 
teaching at UCSD right now. To 
increase that number by 750, the 
university would need to add 
nearly 100 new faculty members 
each year leading up to 2008. 

Getting 750 new professors 
won't be terribly difficult, but 
keeping UCSD's reputation and 
filling those 750 spots with 
notable, high-quality professors, is 
something else. Sure there are 
thousands of professors out there 
that would die for a teaching posi-
tion at UCSD, but we don't want 
just any shmuck with a Ph.D off 
the street, do we? 

Now, I'm not saying that a Ph.D 
is necessary. Sometimes the uni-
versity puts too much emphasis on 
finding professors with Ph.Os and 
neglects to look at their teaching 
ability, but we cannot allow just 
any, .random college professor to 
teach here. UCSD is known for 
having some of the best professors 
around: five Nobel Laureates, sev-
eral Pulitzer Prize winners, three 
recipients of the National Medal of 
Sciences, a Fields Medallist and 
five MacArthur Fellows. 

I imagine that the biology and 
engineering departments will be 
hit hardest; even businesses in 
their respective fields have trouble 
filling their offices with qualified 
employees, who are no doubt less

If St. John's Wort does treat 
depression, no one's really sure 
how it does this. It may inhibit 
monoamine oxidase like the drug 
reserpine, or it may facilitate sero-
tonin production like Prozac. It 
may do both. This confusion is 
potentially deadly. Someone tak-
ing a monoamine oxidase 
inhibitor (MAOI) must watch his 
or her tyramine intake - without 
MAOls, things like aged cheeses 
and chocolate can raise blood 
pressure to dangerous levels. 

It is disturbing to see the same 
articles that laud the "proven" 
MAOI effects of St. John's wort 
deny that it has any side effects. 
Until we know what the specific 
effects of the herb are on the chem-
istry of the brain, taking it instead 
of a doctor-prescribed medication 
- or especially at the same time, 
risking potentially harmful inter-
actions - is like having an opera-

tured the essence of politics dur-
ing the mid-80s and early-90s. 

Does either Gore or Bradley 
fulfill the Democratic Party's 
need for a spokesman? Can either 
one · represent the party? 
Definitely not Bradley; he was 
not thought of highly during his 
tenure in the Senate, where he 
was seen as being too aloof. This 
leaves the vice preSident. Though 
he is the closest the Democratic 
Party has to a unifying leader, 
Gore is far from the best choice. 
Tell me the truth - do you really 
want someone who claimed that 
he was "the father of the Internet" 
and that Clinton was one of the 
nation's greatest presidents to 
lead your party into the next mil-
lennium? 

This leaves the million dollar 
question: Can either man fulfill the 
role of president of the United 
States? Can the Democratic Party 
retain the Oval Office? At this 
point the answer is a plain and 
simple no. Again, I would have to 
defer to Gore as the Democratic 
nominee based simply on experi-
ence, but neither man would be 
able to stand against Republican 
candidates: Senator John McCain 
and Gov. George Bush. 

The democrats' only hope for 
winning the 2000 election is to 
find a general amongst the 
troops. Of course, this is easier 
said than done. Admittedly, the 
Democrats briefly accomplished 
this late in 1996, and early 1997 
when Clinton came back from 
utter defeat in 1994 and 1995 to

qualified - or at least less well-
rounded - than an engineering or 
biology professor should be. 

Since it is going to be difficult 
to find a balance between quality 
and quantity, the strain will most 
likely be pushetl onto the students,

again, they might not. 
The general strategy of herbal-

ists seems to be just the opposite 
of pharmacologists: "Here's a 
plant, I wonder what will happen 
if I eat it." It is to be understood 
that there are re~l-world applica-
tions for these drugs, but for all 
the scientific claims that have 
been made, manufacturers are 
going about marketing them in a 
very unscientific way. Most 
reviews of these drugs stress the 
necessity for more trials, but per-
haps these trials should have 
been conducted prior to their 
release on the market.

something that comes in a pretty

You'd have to be pretty brave - or 
pretty stupid - to eat a mushroom

wouldn't think twice about going 
to Ralph's or a health store and

That's because we trust the judg-

safety of their products.

become the "new" Democrat. 
This, however, did not last long. 

The Republicans, on the other 
hand, have always had an inte-
gral leader. In the '80s, there was 
the Gipper, Ronald Reagan. Next 
came Bush, though his tenure 
was cut short, something hard-
core Republicans are still bitter 
about. In ]994 to 1995, Newt 
Gingrich stood tall as the Speaker 
of the House. Afterwards, in 1996, 
Bob Dole took over as the 
Republicans' voice. 

For Democrats, there is no 
strong voice. There is no one to 
epitomize Democratic ideals. 
Several names can be mentioned, 
such as (don't snicker too loudly) 
that of the First Lady, Hillary 
Clinton. Politically, the thought 
of the First Lady as the party 
leader is very a ttractive for 
Democrats. Already a force to 
reckoned with in New York, 
where she is contending with 
New York City Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani for a seat in the Senate, 
the First Lady has the ability to 
garner new voters for the 
Democrats, particularly those of 
women. This, of course, is still 
dependent on the defeat of 
Giuliani, a difficult challenge. 

As the next election, and the 
next millennium, looms ever clos-
er, the Democrats are without a 
guide. The lack of central leader-
ship has hurt the party on every 
level: Its numbers in· Congress, its 
hold on the presidency and its 
ability to reach to the American 
public. In the short term, the 
party's hope of salvation lies in 
Vice President Gore, a prospect 
many are not content with. In the 
long run, this is an issue the party 
must address if it desires to ever 
win the presidency again.

RYe Bodies Found in Mexico CHINA: Y2K 
official predicts no 
loss due to computers 

Ms. Zhang has led a crash 
effort to catch up, and 
Wednesday she claimed impor-
tant successes while conceding 
that some regions and enterprises 
had stiU paid little attention to 
the problem. 

CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico 
- Forensic experts from the 
United States have unearthed 
the remains of five people at a 
farm outside this border city, 
where they are searching with 
Mexican investigators for clues 
to the fate of scores of people 
who have disappeared, most of 
them after running afoul of drug 
traffickers. 

Journalists who watched the 
exhumations across !he front 
wall of the farm Wednesday saw 
agents gather material several 
times from a shallow pit, place it 
in bags and carry it a few yards 
to a mobile forensics laboratory 
that the FBI has moved to the 
site. The farm sits on the south-
ern outskirts of Juarez, 15 miles 
south of the border at EI Paso. 

The head of the Mexican 
police's organized-crime unit, 
Jose Larrieta Carrasco, said 
three sets of human skeletal 
remains were discovered on 
the third day of the jOint opera-
tion. Partial remains of two 
other people were found on 
Tuesday. 

The search apparently began 
after an FBI informer, whose 
identity is secret, told authorities 
that bodies were buried at the

Larrieta, who spoke briefly 

to dozens of reporters at the 
farm, said that some of the bod-
ies had been found with cloth-
ing and that others were in 
underwear. 

Attorney General Jorge 
Madrazo said in a television 
interview in Mexico City that 
along with the remains found 
on Tuesday, the investigators 
also encountered ·some cloth-

New York's Primary Rules 
May Keep McCain Off Ballot 

No matter how well Sen. lohn 
McCain does in the early presi-
dential contests, his luck will 
almost certainly run out in one of 
the next skirmishes, the delegate-
rich New York primary on March 
7. 

Republicans in much of the 
state will not cast their ballots for 
McCain, his campaign concedes, 
because his name will not appear 
on their ballots. 

Four years after New York's 
burdensome election laws were 
widely criticized for keeping 
prominent Republicans out of the 
presidential primary, the field is 
once again dwindling, and some 
candidates are declaring that in 
New York, Tammany Hall-style 
bossism lives on. 

The McCain campaign hopes 
to qualify in half of the state's 
congressional districts, but even 
that goal may be too ambitious. 
Three underdogs - Gary Bauer, 
Sen. Orrin Hatch and Alan Keyl'$ 
- are expected to skip New 
York's primary altogether, saying 
that, as usual, the system is

Seattle shuts off

CoIItIIIued front ..... 1 
Clinton sided with the cause of 
many of the peaceful demonstra-
tors who jammed Seattle's streets 

VVednesda~ even as he 
denounced those who engaged in 
violence. 

"What they are telling us in 
the streets is that this is an issue 
we've been silent on," Clinton 
told the ministers from 135 coun-
tries of the World Trade 
Organization, "and we won't be 
silent anymore. The sooner the 
WTO opens up the process" of 
rule-making to outside groups, 
he said, "we'll see less demon-
strations and more constructive 
debate." 

Even as Clinton spoke at 
Seattle's busy port and then to 
the WTO itself, the protests con-
tinued, though on a far smaller 
and less destructive scale, 

rigged to favor the choice of the 
state party, in this case, Gov. 
George W. Bush of Texas. 

So while voters in several 
. states with primaries on the same 
day will select from a full menu of 
contenders (including some 
unknowns), most New York 
Republicans will probably decide 
between two: Bush, who will 
readily land a spot across the 
state because the party establish-
ment has deployed its foot sol-
diers to help him, and mi11ionaire 
publisher Steve Forbes, who 
plans to spend $750,000 to navi-
gate the many shoals in the peti-
tion process. 

Elsewhere, getting on the bal-
lot can be simply a formality. 
California, Connecticut, 
Maryland and Massachusetts, all 
of which hold primaries March 7, 
automatically give spots to candi-
dates with nationaf recognition. 
Missouri requires only a $1,000 
filing fee.

Thousands of police officers,

more than 300 people who sat at 
intersections or who attempted to 
block the delegates from getting 
to their meetings Wednesday. 

Apparentlr under the strong 
suggestion 0 federal authorities, 
the city Wednesday radically 
changed its tactics for dealing 
with demonstrators, closing down 
virtually all streets where protest-
ers had been allowed to roam 
freely on Tuesday and leaving 
broad boulevards eerily empty at 
mid-day. And even on the fringes 
of downtown, the officers confis-
cated cell phones and gas masks 
from the demonstrators, denying 
them the two tools that allowed 
the protesters to run circles 
around the police the day before.

pie who have disappeared in 
and around luarez in recent 
years. 

An association of relatives of 
the missing people has collected 
files on nearly 200 vanished peo-
ple. Most are Mexicans, though 
Madrazo said 22 were U.S. citi-
zens. 

Although most of-the missing 
vanished after the Mexican 
police had detained them, no 
one has been charged in any of 
the cases. Authorities presume 
the officers who carried out the 
detentions had been paid off by 
traffickers. 

Juarez has long been a major 
center of drug trafficking, 
plagued by frequent killings 
and unexplained disappear-
ances. 

Authorities have detained 
several members of a family 
that was living at the farm 
where the bodies were 
unearthed. On Tuesday, the 
head of the family and another 
man who appears on property 
records as the farm owner were 
flown by authorities to Mexico

Social Promotion to Remain in L.A. 
LOS ANGELES - Faced with 

the prospect that 40 percent or 
more of the students in rublic 
schools here would fai if a 
tough new promotion policy 

~ere implemented, the school 
board is considering drastically 
scaling back a plan to end so-
called social promotiOJ\. iJ\ an 
effort to keep the whole program 
from collapsing. 

With California's schools in 
what some regard as a state of 
crisis, the state Legislature 
passed a law last year ending a 
policy under which schools 
allowed most students to 
advance to the next grade to 
maintain social continuity, even 
if they did not meet minimum 
standards, a policy known as 
social promotion. 

School districts around the 
state were given several years to 
introduce a policy requiring 
students to meet minimum 
requirements before being pro-
moted. Similar programs, in one 
form or another, have been 
adopted by a number of dis-
tricts around the country to 

raise the performance of failing 
schools. 

The Los Angeles Unified 
School District, the second 
largest in the nation, had adopt-
ed a program just this past 
February to apply the new stan-
dards to five grades after this 
school year - 2, 3,4,5 and 8. But 
it is now considering applying 
them to just two of the grades, 
perhaps 2 and 8, because of the 
overwhelming shortfalls in per-
formance in a school system. in 
which 45 percent of the students 
have limited or no English skills 
and nearly a third change 
schools or leave during the year. 

School administrators in the 
sprawling district of Los Angeles 
have known since this past sum-
mer that to state-mandated stan-
dardized test results showed 
that as many as half the 711,000 
students in public schools here 
would fail if the new policy were 
put in place promptly. 

More recently, teacher evalu-
ations of students now suggest 
that perhaps 280,000 children, or 
about 40 percent of the district, 

would fail if just those evalua-
tions were used rather than the 
tests, school officials said. And 
that applies just to reading and-
English skills, not math, where 
the standards will be phased in 
later. 

The figures appalled many 
school officials, and they agreed 
that if so many students were 
held back, it would overwhelm 
the systems being set up to help 
them, including summer 
schools and tutoring. So the 
school board has begun to 
debate the best way to phase in 
the new policy, an approach that 
wou Id still leave classrooms 
filled with students who could 
not keep up, but would at least 
start to give a smaller number a 
better chance. 

The school board staff has 
estimated that even this limited 
implementation will cost a little 
more than $72 million next year 
alone, with most of that for sum-
mer schools.

Supreme Court Hears Argument on Proposed 
FDA Regulation of 'Drug Delivery Devices' 

WASHINGTON The 
Clinton administration faced a 
notably skeptical Supreme 
Court on Wednesday as it tried 
to convince the justices that the 
Food and Drug Administration 
has jurisdiction over tobacco 
and the authority to regulate cig-
arettes as "drug delivery 
devices." 

For an intense hour, the 
crowded courtroom became the 
latest battleground in the tobac-
co wars that have swept through 
Congress and presidential poli-
tics. But the familiar policy argu-
ments took second place to a 
prolonged and largely technical 
dissection of food and drug 
laws. 

Solicitor General Seth 
Waxman labored to demon-
strate that the regulations that· 
the FDA issued in 1996 to deter 
smoking by minors, which 

were struck down last year by a 
federal appeals court, fit com-
fortably within its core public 
health mission. Richard 

. Cooper, a former general coun-
sel of the FDA who now repre-
sents the five cigarette makers 
that challenged the regulations, 
said the FDA's action was law-
less in the absence of an explic-
it congressional grant of 
authority. 

A significant hurdle for the 
administration was that for 
nearly its entire history, from its 
establishment under the fedefal 
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 
1938 until the mid-1990s, the 
FDA itself maintained that it had 
no authority to regulate smok-
ing. 

Waxman's position is that the 
FDA, properly and understand-
ably, changed its mind in the 
face of new and "overwhelming 

evidence" that nicotine is addic-
tive and that cigarette manufac-
turers "knew this and were engi-
neering their products to deliver 
the precise dose of nicotine that 
consumers need to obtain its 
effects." 

The Food, Drug and 
Cosmetic Act defines a drug as a 
substance, other than food, 
"intended to affect the structure 
or any function of the body." So 
evidence not only of nicotine~ 
properties but of the manufac-
turers' intent to exploit those 
effects was crucial to the FDA's 
late-day re-evaluation, Waxman 
said. 

Another major obstacle for 
the administration appeared to 
be the FDA's choice to regulate 
smoking rather than ban it.

much fun in my classes. 'Cause the 
teachers are really good, you 
know, they make it fun." 

Currently she is taking three

course. At 14, she became the 
youngest female with a bachelor's 
degree this century, earning a 
behavioral sciences degree from 
the University of Maryland in 
1998. 

Saeed never took the SATs but 
registered an IQ of 210, more than 
twice the average. 

Her older brother, Alexander

southern California band, whose extreme 
energy and fast-paced songs got the crowd 
moving and set the tone for the rest of the 
night. With p,?pular songs such as "Zip Lock 
Bag" and 'My Own Worst Enemy," Lit 
immediately captured the crowd and paved 
the way for the feCltured performer Garbage. 

Garbage took the stage and immediately 
captured the crowd's attention and enthusi-
asm by playing "'1 Crush," their hit song 
from the "Romeo and Juliet" soundtrack. 

Garbage's lead Singer Shirley Manson said 
that her band was using the MTV Campus 
Invasion Tour to conclude its 25-country 
world tour that has lasted for over 20 months. 

Manson also said that she was saddened 
by the conclusion of Garbage's world tour, 
and since she did not want the tour to end, 
she continued chatting with the crowd. Man-
son told stories of how she had lipstick all 
over her teeth all day long, and continued 
chatting with the crowd as if the audience 
was her best friend, which only made the 
fans love her more. 

Garbage did its share of playing music 
too, with such hit songs as "Stupid Girl," 
"Special," "When I Grow Up," and "Push It." 
Garbage also played its new song, "The 
World is Not Enough," which is the featured 
title track of the new James Bond movie. 

Garbage concluded its successful evening 
with its first major smash, "Only Happy 
When it Rains," which excited the crowd 
even more and sent some fans' bodies flying 
over the security railing just in front of the 
stage. 

Associated Students' Commissioner of 
Programming Scott Mantell said that the 
concert was a big success both for the per-
formers and the university. 

"Garbage played extremely well and the 
performance was just great overall," Mantell 
said. "The Campus Invasion concert is just 
another example of great concerts that are 
happening at UCSD, and this is great 
because it's showing people that UCSD is 
quickly becoming a well-known and popular 
place to host concerts." 

This is becoming very apparent, as MTV 
has only launched its Campus Invasion Tour 
three times, and UCSD has now been on the 
roster twice. Reappearing on the tour twice 
has particular Significance, considering that 
MTV attempts to get around to new college 
campuses and new cities each year.

Several elec-

DJs remixed Bjork 
songs from her first two albums. 
They turned stick-in-your-head, 
thumping dance songs into sultry 
sweeps of sound. 

Bjork's voice becomes an 
instrumental layer of its own, 
blending into the dragging remix 
of "POSSibly Maybe." The Brod-
sky Quartet performs a stripped-
down version of the cyber-sound-
ing "Hyperballad," and "You've 
Been Flirting Again" is a new 
heavenly prance through speak-
ers. 

Though her better known 
songs from Debut and Post are 
catchy and dance-inducing, this 
collection of Bjork remixes offers 
little for the dance step to latch 
onto and blends well into the 
backgrounds of most study

Heart Mother. 

Triumphant orchestral 
arrangements accompany the 
wavy early-70s guitar and eerie 
vocal choruses the band perfected 
a few years later. This pre-Dark

sketch pad with which to study 
because of its lack of familiarity 
and less catchy material.

Listen close to the dragging

It's just as easy to let them fall

Tim Burton's Latest Flick: A Real Scream 
Depp and Ricci light up the screen with their performances, while special effects add the finishing touches 
By JEREMY GRAY 
Senior Staff ~ter 

There is a difference between 
camp and ' schlock - something 
director TIm Burton knows all too 
well. For proof just look at the 
instant cult status his films seem to 
gather the moment they are 
released. "Edward Scissorhands," 
"Ed Wood," "The Nightmare 
Before Christmas," "Mars Attacks" 
- each a collection of characters 
bobbing on the waters of lunacy, 
whose only relationship with nor-
mality is that the people they sur-
round themselves with are even 
more insane than they are. 

Burton - a distant cousin of 
normality twice removed -
always knows how to step back 
from the picture and remind him-
self that every once in a while an 
audience goes to a movie to be 
entertained. "Sleepy Hollow" is a 
campfire story with an emphasis 
on camp, a legend stretched over 
celluloid and painted with a 
flashlight held inches under the 
director's glowing chin. 

The film itself is as simple as 
Washington Irving's story upon 
which it is based. Shunned for his 
unorthodox approach to law, a 
modem day da Vinci named Icha-
bod Crane (Depp) is sent out to 
the backwoods town of Sleepy 
Hollow to investigate a series of 
murders which all have one thing 
in common: the victims are 
beheaded and the heads missing. 
His travels lead him to a buxom 
blonde Katrina Van Tassel (Ricci) 
who dabbles in witchcraft and 
may be hiding something behind 
her sweet smile.

Spooky. Johnny Depp (left) and Christina Ricci hold on to their heads (and each other) in Tim Burton's perfectly creepy 'Sleepy Hollow.' 

Of course, the murders in 
question are the responsibility of 
the Headless Horseman, and it 
becomes Ichabod's quest to prove 
that the Horseman's existence is 

Rogue 
Portland 
Pyramid 

Red Nectar 
SloBrew 

no more than mere fabrication, a 
scientific sleight of hand. 
Although the premise wears thin 
over the course of two hours, it is 
Ichabod's naIve belief in science 
that holds the story together. 

Ichabod is a quivering mess of 
a man whose delights come from 
wild-eyed hypotheses and his 
self-made collection of surgical 
wonders that seems to have 
hopped out of Terry Gilijam's 
cluttered basement. He's a detec-
tive so caught up in the pursuit of 
the next big clue that the first 
glimpse of the legend he so des-
perately pursues sends him back

into bed with the covers pulled 
up over his eyes. 

Depp could have made Icha-
bod into the kind of man who puts 
all of his faith into science even as 
everyone around him tums to the 
comfort of religion. Instead, Icha-
bod is human - someone whose 
whole life shatters around him, 
stripping his fa~ade to the bare 
bones of a child with no under-
standing of a new ~lity. 

"Sleepy Hollow" is a pure 
ghost story: there are characters 
to identify with, plenty of sus-
pense, and enough gory payoffs 
to justify adding an extra lock to 

the front door. But as Burton is 
well aware, a good ghost story 
doesn't survive on a few severed 
heads. You have to think yours is 
next. A master of seduction, he 
fills each scene with enough 
atmosphere that you can smell 
the wisps of smoke as they curl 
off the tips of candles, or feel the 
twigs snapping beneath the pan-
icked hooves of frantic stallions. 
The trees bend, leaves crackle, the 
moonlight reflects off rooftops -
it is the kind of dark place that 
makes you want to huddle under 
a blanket to make it go away. 

The town of Sleepy Hollow is 

a character unto itself, and every-
body else is just trespassing. 

Burton doesn't try to slip any-
thing past the audience. He wants 
close-ups. He wants to crank up 
Danny Elfman's haunting musical 
score. He wants the audience to 
hang on every laughable word, 
from "You must be a witch," to the 
payoff, ''because you've bewitched 
me." Whether it is the twinkle in 
Johnny Depp's eye or the been-
there smirk across Christina Ricci's 
face, "Sleepy Hollow" is both a 
dark legend and a laugh-because-
you're-embarrassed-and-scared 
romp in the trees.

Album Reviews 

NNI._m-t 
Live in Concert u_ 
-**** 

After touring for a year, first 
with Sarah McLachlan's Lilith 
Fair and then on her own, Natalie 
Merchant arrived in her home 
state of New York in June for a 
five-day stint at the Neil Simon 
Theater on Broadway. Her latest 
album contains 11 songs from the 
sold-out New York shows. 

This album encompasses a 
perfect variety of what fans have 
come to appreciate about the for-
mer lead singer of 10,000 Mani-
acs, showcasing her amazing 
vocal and song-writing abilities. 
The only Merchant-esque ele-
ments missing from this album 
are the sappy lyrics of songs such 
as "Kind and Generous," which 
have unfortunately come to char-
acterize Merchant to millions of 
radio listeners within the past 
year. Instead, the album is full of 
songs from her earlier days, as 
well as material from David 
Bowie, Neil Young and other 
industry icons. 

Merchant's trademark "social-
ly conscious" style of music 
comes across loud and clear on 
"Dust Bowl" and "Gun Shy," 
both of which are from her 10,000 
Maniacs days. In both songs, 
Merchant adds plenty of volume 
and energy to the once-quiet bal-
lads, transforming them to the 
point where they almost no 
longer resemble the original ver-
sions. Her transformation of the 
Maniacs' classic hit "These Are 
Days" into a 100minute percus-
sion jam was left off the album 
but was included in the "Natalie 
Merchant, Live in Concert" video. 

Much of the new album con-

tains songs from h~ solo debut, 
Tigerlily, including the hit singles 
"Wonder" and "CarnivaL" Sur-
prisingly, the album contains only 
the title track from her second 
solo effort Ophelia. The exclusion 
of other Ophelia songs from the 
live album opens up precious 
space for cover material such as 
Bowie's hit "Space Oddity" and a 
little-known song (but one of 
Merchant's favorites), "The Gulf 
of Araby." 

Like most live albums, this one 
falls ever-so-slightly short of 
packing the full punch of a live 
concert. While Merchant builds 
most of her songs to a loud climax 
(which is sometimes, but not 
always the case in her studio-
recorded material), the album 
does not capture the rawness that 
such a climax can evoke. She 
never "yells" and her voice never 
cracks under pressure. 

Also lost in the live album are 
her often-playful interactions 
with the audience. Fortunately, 
these are captured to some extent 
on the video in her renditions of 
"Senor Don Gato" and "Water-
bound." 

After 19 years as a singer-
songwriter, LIve i/l Concert is liv-
ing proof that Merchilnt's voice 
has not faded nor grown old. It 
has instead improved, becoming 
fuller and more smooth with age.

DrIIIn ITH 
Freaks of Nature 

--
-**** 

Sweden has a lot more to offer 
than scary metal bands like 
Entombed and Mashuggah and 
pop "bands" such as Ace of Base 
and Roxette. 

In Sweden, they are still 
known as "Drain." But when they 
decided to spread their music to 
the eager ears of American rock-
ers, they were told that a punk 
band already existed with the 
same name. 

Where did the "5TH" come 
from? Well consider yourselves 
enlightened. SfH is an abbrevia-
tion of Stockholm's international 
airport and was chosen because 
of its "industrial feeL" Although 
Drain STH's music is not "indus-
trial," it does have a rough, pelt-
ing, slightly industrial quality to 
it. 

Their first album, Horror 
Wrestling, made these enchanting 
female strangers from Sweden a 
smash hit in the underground 
metal scene. Beside the fact that 
they are beautiful and can play 
metal riffs faster than the speed of 
light, it also helped that Ozzy 
Ozboume and Tony lommi took 
them under their enormous 
wings and had them play 
Ozzfests '97 and '99. The band 
will also open for Black Sabbath 
in Birmingham, England, for Sab-
bath's final show. 

Freaks of Nature, Drain STH's 
latest creation, explodes with 
powerful melodies and painful 
lyrics. All things considered, the 
two years since their last album 
were well worth the wait. The 
first song, "Enter My Mind," 
makes one wonder if this band is 
making a switch to catchy pop. 

With Freaks, the I;>and succeeds 
in making the crunchy parts even 
heavier, while expanding on their 
melodic side with catchy hooks 
that will easily get stuck in your 
head for days, even if you aren't a 
fan. 

The dark, haunting, vocal 
blend of Maria Sjoholm (vos:als), 
Anna K. (bass! and Martina Axen 
(drums) is prominent throughout 
Freaks. Their sound mixes perfect-
ly with the crushing guitar 
sounds of Flavia Canel to create 
beautifully dark works of ethere-
al art. 

The song "Black" is reminis-
cent of Pantera's "5 Minutes 
Alone" but with Maria's soothing 
vocals calming the rain of torren-

Definition of dilemma: a blank 
9O-minute cassette and the new 
7D-minute CD by The Artist For-
merly Known as Prince. Continue 
reading. 

If this were a 2-sided vinyl 
record, it could be divided into a 
dull side and a hot side. The dull 
side is most of the first thirty 
minutes, with duds like "The 
Greatest Romance Ever Sold" (a 
plodding "Anastesia" retread) 
and the title track. Most of the 
vocals are the Artist alone with 
his overdubs, so there's a same-
ness to the harmonies. The 
omnipresent drum machine and 
synth accents add to the monot-
ony. Guest rappers and scratch-
ers are half hearted c:oncessions 
to today's market, and don't add 
much. The Artist even acknowl-
edges that he could care less; in 
"Undisputed" he boasts that 
"Once again 1 don ' t follow 
trends, they follow me." 

The Artist has always been 
able to craft woman problems

STUDY: 
Tortoise's TNT makes 
good study music 
Continued from pac. 1. 

Simple piano backs sexy gui-
tars and sultry vocals. Keyboards 
and samples tie everything 
together quietly for a string of 
romance-inducing songs. How-
ever, productive studying comes 
from the romance between a stu-
dent and a book. 

"Elsewhere" and "Ice" hush 
the tone of the album, powerful 
but quiet tunes to read to. The 

CD: 
The 'Artist' turns in 
a mediocre effort 
ContInued from pac. 17 
cynical "Man 0' War" and "Silly 
Game" to the heartbreaking 
"Love U, But Don't Trust U Any-
more." The guitar line at the end 
of "Man 0 ' War" literally aches. 
"Love U" features guest Ani Di 
Franco on guitar and a tnlly sor-
rowful and wistful acoustic 
piano. The understated string 
arrangements enhance the 
moody feel of these sad songs. 

To be sure, there's also some 
tunes you can play at a party. 
The best of these throw out the 
machines and rock with old fash-
ioned instruments. The Artist's 
duet with Sheryl Crow, "Baby 
Knows," has it all-a hot har-
monica intro, chunky guitar, 
lyrics that are clever and funny, 
and a stop and start rhythm that 
creates great musical tension and 
release. He even tips his purple 
cap to Crow with a funky cover 
of "Every Day Is A Winding 
Road." 

The jaunty "So Far, So 
Pleased" reflects the Artist's pop 
side, in the tradition of "When 
You Were Mine" and " I Could 
Never Take the Place of Your 
Man." Unlike other tunes here, 
he's content to be teased for a 
while rather than have his world 
rocked . Everything is neatly 
wrapped up with a stylistic nod 
to the Godfather-the fun "Pretty 
Man" is propelled by a James 
Brown beat and hot sax solos by 
Maceo Parker. 

Solution to dilemma: use the 
front of the cassette for the hot 
side of RilVf, and use the back for 
some cuts from Prillce: Tilt Hils.

One song might switch from a 
riding-into-sunset cowboy feel to 
a late night rave tone in the 
course of minutes. All under the 
guise of jazz, the band dances 
organs and guitars over the tic-
to k of a clock ("Almost Always 
is Nearly Enough") and the giddy, 
voices of children in the park (' I 
Set My Face to the Hillside"). 

The band expertly ties many 
sounds into songs and a some-
what steady motion throu gh-
out an album that is just dis-
jointed enough to provide good 
background music for produc-
tivity.

Fencing Slices Past 
Cal State Fullerton 
SLICING: By winning in five of six weapons, the 
Triton fencers defeat arch-rival Cal State Fullerton 
By BIll BURGER 
Sports Editor 

she went 6-0 on the day while 
Jeanette Wenzel tallied a 5-1 
record. 

In sports, it often takes a team 
many years to take the thrown 
from a rival. Once it does over-
come that hurdle, the team 
often never looks back. The 

The UCSD men were almost as 
successful on the strip last week-
end, losing only one weapon to 

Cal State Fullerton and sweep-
ing Cal Tech. 

feats of the San Fransisco 
4gers of the early '80s and 
the Detroit 
Pistons of the ' 
late '80s and 
early '90s are 
good exam-
ples of this phenomenon. 

As the UCSD fencing team 
proved last Saturday, it doesn' t 
take something as dramatic as 
Joe Montana finding Dwight 
Clark in the back of the end zone 
to achieve one of these great 
feats. 

It had been many years since 
the Triton fencers had defeated 
the TItans of Cal State Fullerton. 
In one mighty thrust, UCSD 
erased years of heartbreak last 
weekend when both the men's 
and women's teams defeated 
their arch-enemies. Cal Tech also 
fell to the soaring Tritons as they 
completed their day of domi-
nance. 

For the Tritons, there was little 
doubt of a successful outcome at 
women's epee. May tal Dahan 
went undefeated on the day 
while Julia Kulla-Mader and 
Hannah Griffin both went 5-l. 

"There is no squad in the con-
ference that can compete with 
these women," Head Coach 
Stuart Lee said. "They are a bas-
tion of consistency." 

Women's sabre also had an 
easy time, defeating both Cal 
Tech and Cal State Fullerton. 
Sophomore Jessica Spuehler went 
6-0 on the day while Amber 
Largent, who recently represent-
ed UCSD in foil, went 5-l. 

"I like the extra adrenaline that 
sabre requires," Largent said of 
her switch of weapons. 

Lee later said that he feels this 
squad has a chance for a string of 
conference championships reach-
ing well into the next millennium. 

Women's foil had the closest 
match of the day, defeating Cal 
State Fullerton by only one bout 
while easily handling Cal Tech. 
Team captain Josephine Roberts 
was the squad's saving grace as 

WOMEN: 
Jury still out on 
season's success 
CoIItInued from ..... 24 
Down by a pair of buckets at the 
half, UCSD capitalized off of 
Chico State's 28 turnovers to 
take the win. At the break the 
Tritons discussed their strategy 
and came out looking like anoth-
er team. 

Forward Genevieve Ruvald 
played an integral part in the 
Tritons' victory. Along with her 
team-best 14 points, the 5'11" 
junior brought down 9 boards, 
the most recorded by a Triton on 
the day. 

Freshman guard Nicholle 
Bromley, a San Diego native, 
was also a big play-maker for 
UCSD against Chico. Bromley 
was the second-highest scorer 
on the team, turning in 12 points 
including seven of seven 
attempts from the free-throw 
line. Bromley also played some 
good defense, scrapping for 5 
defensive rebounds. 

Although the Tritons took 
care of Chico State, they are by 

Men's foil welcomed 
two-time 

NCAA qual-
ifier Tedd Padgitt 

to its ranks for the 
match-up with 

Fullerton, which turned out 
to be a good move by Lee, 
as they defeated Fullerton 

6-3. Padgitt went 3-0 against 
Fullerton while Wes Bellanca 
went 2-1 and Jacky Ngo finished 
at 1-2. Against Cal Tech the squad 
had little trouble, even with 
Padgitt returning to his usual 
weapon of sabre. 

The men's sabre team was at a 
disadvantage against Fullerton, 
with its ace Padgitt competing in 
foil. In the end it didn't need 
Padgitt as the squad defeated 
Fullerton 5-4. Team captain Min 
An and sophomore Andrew 
Anfora each posted two wins 
while freshman Eugene Lee 
clinched the win with his lone 
victory. 

"I gambled that these guys 
were tough enough to win with-
out Padgitt," Lee said. "And they 
were." 

With Padgitt back in its ranks 
for the Cal Tech match, the sabre 
team posted another victory and 
remains undefeated for the year. 

The men's epee squad was the 
only team to fall to Fullerton, but 
came back strongly to defeat Cal 
Tech. Freshman Shawn Pheil led 
the team, going 5-1 on the day. The 
1·1 record of this squad brings its 
overall record this season to 4-1 . 

"These guys are not strug-
gling," Lee said. "On the contrary, 
they are learning fast and fencing 
well ." 

All three fencers who compet-
ed this weekend will be returning 
next year. 

Both the Triton men and 
women are at the top of the con-
ference now and hope to continue 
their undefeated seasons when 
they travel to Chicago in January 
to take on many east-coast powers 
including Ohio State and 
Michigan. 

no means out of the woods. 
Thirty turnovers and a team 
total of 28 percent from the floor 
does not add up to make a con-
vincing win. Nor does it make 
future competition shake in its 
shorts. 

But what ·future Triton adver-
saries may not expect is UCSD's 
strong combination of veterans 
and rookies. 

With the likes of the returning 
Ruvald, Kate Turnbull and 
defensive dynamo Marci 
Ernsberger, the Tritons have a 
solid core of players who know 
Malone's offensive and defen-
sive schemes. Plus, with new-
comers Bromley and freshman 
Natalie Beaver, who have shown 
they have the potential to fill the 
large shoes left by last year's 
graduated guards Tristen 
Teasdale and Amy McClure, the 
Tritons can count on a solid sea-
son. 

Next up for the Tritons is 
their home opener tomorrow 
night against University of 
Redlands. TIp-off is at 5 p.m. 
Make sure to get out to RIMAC 
Arena to support the women's 
basketball team and root them

ball Head Coach John Block 
said. "UCSD is a young and 
inexperienced team, but well-
coached." 

The hearty Tritons were 
unwavered by Point Lorna's out· 
burst and scrapped back. 

UCSD's Ahmad Russ scored a 
pair of baskets that were followed 
by a three-pointer by teammate 
Nick Christensen quickly pulling 
the game to 58-54. 

Then the bottom fell out. 
"We ran out of whatever it is 

we ran out of," Lanthier said. "We 
aren't that good of a basketball 
team right now. We didn't play 
well for 40 minutes. When you 
don't play well for 40 minutes, 
you get beat by the good tearns." 

Point Loma went on a 20-3 run 
to put the game out of reach for 
the Tritons at 'iJ-fIJ. The run was 
led by the Crusaders' Brian Frey 
who contributed with nine points 
and was capped with a three-
pointer by JoShua Williams. 

The Tritons were stunned and 
could only muster eight more 
points for the rest of the contest, 
losing 85-68. 

The Tritons were lead by 
Selby, who came off of the bench 
to score 15 points. 

"Selby does some good 
things and he does some bad 
things," Lanthier said. "That is 
what a [rookie) does." 

The Triton's Russ also came 
off the bench, scoring 14 points. 

"We didn't play' great," Russ 
said . "We didn t play hard 
enough and we didn't play 
tough enough. We need to extri-
cate why we all play basketball. 
We either play basketball or play' 
what we did tonight. I don t 
know what you call what we 
played tonight." 

The Crusaders were lead on 
the court by B.J. Foster, who 
scored 23 points and grabbed 7 
rebounds.

half of league. Ryan [Tenpas) 
and Willie [Briscoe] are the only 
new guys. This is a team I know 
and we know how to play 
together. It helps to build a team 
and helps to come together." 

The Tritons had two early 
leads of 5-2 and 13-11, but aside 
from that, were never ahead of 
the Crusaders though they often 
were on the brink of a lead .

Water Polo to Play for National Title 
TOURNAMENT: Two more wins are needed to capture UCSD's first open-division NCAA National Championship 
By BILL BURGER 
Sports Editor 

With finals, winter break and 
Y2K fas t approaching, UCSD is 
braced fo r the its last grea t sports 
event of the 20th century. This 
weekend, Stanfo rd University, 
UCLA and the University of 
Massachusetts join the Tritons at 
Canyonview Pool for the open-
division NCAA Water Po lo 
National Championships. 

The tournament gets under-
way on Saturday at 1:30 p.m. 
when top-ranked UCLA takes on 
the tournament's fourth-ranked 
team, the Uni versity of 
Massachusetts. That game will be 
immedia tely fo llowed by one 
between second-ranked Stanford 
University and UC San Diego, the 
tournament's third-seeded team . 

The losers of the first two 
games will play at noon fo r third 
place while the two winners of 
Sa tu rday's games will square off 
at 1 :30 p.m. to determine the 
championship. 

UCLA is the tournament's top 
seed and qualified for the tourna-
ment by winning the Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) 
tourna ment. The fi nal of that 
tournament was an epic double-
overtime clash with Sta nfo rd 
Universi ty, one which the Bruins 
look 12-11 . The Bruins are also the 
top-ranked team in the country 
and are led by MPSF tournament 
MVP Matt Armato and juniors 
Adam Wright and Sean Kern. 

Armato and UCLA Head 
Coaches Guy Baker and Adam 
Krikorian are happy to be back at 
Canyonview pool, where they 
last won the NCAA National 
Championship in 1996. 

Stanford University's record in 
NCAA Tournament play is also 
impressive. It is second in first-
place fin ishes (8) and tied with 
UCLA in appearances with 23. 

The Cardinal are led by three-
time All-American Brian Heifferon 
and senior Sean Joy who have each 
scored 36 points this season.

Slow starts have been common place 
for UCSD women's basketball. Last year 
it wasn' t until the middle of January that 
the Tritons pieced together more 
than three wins in a row. But 

UCSD followed its season-opening loss 
with an 84-46 shellacking of Howard
