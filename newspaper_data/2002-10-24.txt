Police arrest 
flasher suspect 

Local candidates sound off 

Man faces counts of indecent 
exposure, sexual assault 

College Oems

Senior Staff Writer 
Police arrested a man on Oct. 

21 whom they believe perpetrated 
the series of flashing incidents that 
have targeted women In the UTe 
and UCSD area since August. 

San Diego police detective Dan 
Dennis identIfied the suspect In 
police custody as 23-year-old 
Anthony Evan Heupel. 

UCSD police detective Doug 
O 'Dell said the suspect IS not affili-
ated with UCSD. 

Heupel was arrested for multi-
ple counts at his orth Park home 
at 4:45 p.m. Monday afternoon, 
according to Dennis. 

"The suspect was arrested on 
three counts of false imprisonment, . 
which are felonies," Dennis said. 
"Also on eight counts of indecent 
exposure and one count of sexual 
assault." 

Dennis said that the three 
counts of false imprisonment are 
the result of three separate inci-
dents. 

"Two of the false imprisonment 
counts are the result of the suspect 
imprisoning two girls in the eleva-
tors at the Costa Verde apartment 
community and another apart-

ment community," Dennis said. 
"The other count stems from the 
UCSD campus Oct. 13 incident, 
when the perpetrator · blocked the 
girls in the cul-de-sac [Lot 402J 
wi th his vehicle and then pursued 
them." 

Dennis declined to provide any 
further information on the sexual 
assault count at this stage of the 
case except to say that it occtlrred 
in another part of town. 

Dennis said the arrest was the 
result of intensive collaborative 
investigation. 

"We looked at old cases and 
consulted an analyst to see if there 
was a match with our composite 
sketch and the series of incidents," 
Dennis said. 

The investigation yielded a 
May case that fit the suspect's 
description and in which a similar 
vehicle was used, according to 
Dennis. 

"In this May case, three-fourths 
of the license plate had been identi-
fied," Dennis said. "So then we ran 
the composite sketch and license 
plate at the Department of Motor 
Vehicles and [the suspect's] name 

. came up."

In an effort to increase voter 
participation and awareness among 
UCSD students, the College 
Democrats held a rally in the Price 
Center on Oct 21 . 

The rally, called "2 1,568 Votes," 
boasted speeches by San Diego 
City Council candidate Mike 
Zucchet (2nd district), Democratic 
Congressional candidate Del 

tewart (52nd district) and 
Congresswoman Susan Davis (53 rd 
district). They spoke in front of a 
backdrop spraypainted with phrases 
about issues of concern to UCSD 
students, such as freedom of expres-
sion. Voter registration tables were 
also set up in the Price Center. 

There are 21,568 undergraduate 
and graduate students at UCSD -
hence the campaigns name - and 
the speakers emphasized the power 
that a population of this size could 
have if all students were to partici-
pate in the electoral process. 

"We need you to be out there 
active and involved and voting," 
Davis said. "I want to challenge you 
to make your voices heard."

Students line up to volunteer 
Expo on Library Walk promotes civic duty 

By UNDACHEU 
Contributing Writer 

T he annual Volunteer Expo 
organized by the A.S. Volunteer 
Connection was held Oct. 22 on 
Library Walk from 10 a.m. to 2 
p.m. to promote student volun-
teering. 

More than 60 different volun-
teer agencies gathered at the expo. 
Campus, mentor, animaVwildlife. 
and health agencies participated. 
These agencies informed students 
of their organization's objective, 
past service projects completed, 
and upcoming activities that inter-
ested students may participate in. 

"It was really good," said 
Marissa Boren, a senior at Eleanor 
Roosevelt College. "I think it is a 
good opportunity to see what is 
out there and how we can help the 
community." 

The organizations explained 
the nonmaterialistic incentives 
that go hand-in-hand with volun-
teering; by joining some of the 
organizations, students gain expo-. 
sure to job fields and majors in 
which they are interested. 

Scripps Health gives its volun-

teers, especially those who are 
inexperienced, a sense of what 
goes on in the medical field to see 
if it is what they really want to 
pursue as a career. Teach for 
America is beneficial to those who 
plan to enter the field of educa-

tion, and South Bay Community 
Services volunteers learn account-
ing skills by helping others file 
taxes.

An ad hoc workgroup of seven 
UCSD staff members has updated 
the university's Consumption of 
Alcohol and/or Malt Beverages 
Policy for the first time in 15 years 
at the request of the vice chancel-
lors of business affairs and student

Vice Chancellor of Student

BRIEFLY ETCETERA ••• 
Bishop from war-torn 

Chiapas to speak Oct. 28 
Retired Catholic bishop Samuel Ruiz will 

give a free lecture titled "The Pursuit of 
Justice from the Perspective of the Poor" at 
8 p.m. on Oct. 28 in the Hojel Hall 
Auditorium of the Institute of the Americas. 

The lecture, which is sponsored by 
UCSD's Burke Lectureship in Religion and 
Society, wi ll be in Spanish, and an English 
translator will be on hand. It is the only lec-
ture he will give on the West Coast this 
year. 

As a humanitarian who has championed 
the rights of the poor in the impoverished 
Mexican state of Chiapas, Ruiz has received 
many awards, includins the Martin Ennals 
Award, given for defending human rights. He 
has also been nominated for the Nobel 
Peace Prize three times. 

Ruiz first assumed his duties in San 
Crist6bal de las Casas in 1960. He has since 
been dubbed ' the red bishop' by critics who 
have accused him of inciting rebellion in 
Mexico's poorest state. 

Ruiz, 78, retired when he reached 
mandatory church retirement age. 

Researchers find method 
to slow leukemia growth 

A method that induces leukemia cells to 
stimulate the immune system against only 
the leukemia cells was discovered by UCSD 
cancer researchers. 

Using the blood samples' of 12 patients 
With acute myeloid leukemia, the white 
cells were separated and given two growth 
factors, granulocyte-monocyte colony-stim-
ulating factor and Interleukll1-4, which stim-
ulate T-cells to attack. After eight days, the 
growth factors were discontinued, and 
interleukin-2 and ant i-CD3/anti-CD28 
monoclonal antibodies were added. These 
additions stimulated the growth and prolif-
eration of the T-cells, which orchestrate the 
immune response to infected or malignant 
cells. 

The team of UCSD researchers was led 
by Edward D. Ball. who is a doctor at the 
Rebecca and John Moores UCSD Cancer 
Center, a professor of mediCine at the UCSD 
School of Medicine and director of the UCSD 
Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program. 

The details of the study are reported in 
the October issue of Biology of Blood and 
Morrow Transplantation .

A.S. COUNCIL AT A CiLANCE 
Items of Immediate 
Consideration 

Resolution regarding the proposed 
changes the policy on the integrity of 
scholarship: passed by consensus 

- Submitted by Ja7ms Lynch, U7Iivtrsity 
Centers Advisory Board, ("air 

The resolution addresses problems the 
A.S. Council sees with a proposal to change 
the current academic integri ty policy. The 
resolution calls for the new policy to not be 
accepted on Oct. 29, when it is to be voted 
upon. 

Lynch said that this resolution is one 
aspect of the council 's attempt to change the 
possible policy. Council members are also 
lobbying professors to oppose the proposed 
policy. 

Reports 
A.S. PresidentJenn Brown 

Brown reponed that she, along with nine 
other student government members, request-
ed to postpone the vote to adopt the new aca-
dernic integrity policy. 

The request was denied by the Academic 
Senate, and the vote will be held . Brown said 
that the 10 students are participating in the 
lobbying Lynch spoke of during public 
input. 

Brown reported that this week was the first 
meeting of the Student Regulations and 
Review Committee. Two student representa-
tives were appointed to the committee. 

Brown reported that she participated in 
and completed the Chancellor's Challenge 
5K -

Vice President Finance Dave Ben 
Beza reported that he is currendy hosting 

funding workshops for student organiza-
tions. One principle member of each organi-
zation must attend a funding woricshop this 
quarter. To see a li st of remaining worlcshop 
times and locations, students can visit

Shelton reported that two of Triton TIde's 
big events are approaching. The two events 
are the Triton TIde "couch game" and a road 
trip to San Bernardino. Students can view 
details and reserve a space at 
www.tritontidt.lIcsd.tdll . 

Commissioner of Student Advocacy Brie 
Finegold 

Finegold reported that she is working on 
publicizing a graduate student's difficulty with 
UCSD. Details about his situation can be 
viewed at W'lJTW.saVesnultnlS.org. 

Finegold also reported that she is working 
on writing a resolution in regard to unjsex 
bathrooms for next week's meeting. 

Muir Sophomore Senator Jeremy Cogan 
Cogan reported that he is working on a 

meal point calendar for on-campus residents. 
Cogan said he hopes the calendar will be ready 
by next week. 

Legislation 

Item H of Old Business 
Question: As a Muir student, do you 

believe that Muir college is the best col-
lege at UCSD? 

Answer choices: "Yes, Muir college is the 
best college at UCSO" or WI decline to vote 
on this item." 

- Submitttd by Colin Parrot, fonntr inter-
im frerlmum Stnlltor, John Muir College 

The A.S. Council discussed this item for 
10 minutes. The item was voted to be placed 
on the table for discussion for two weeks. 
During that time, it will be decided whether 
or not it is a valjd piece of legislation because, 
although Parent was a council member when 
he submined the legislation, Parent is no 
longer a member of the A.S. Council. 

It will also be decided if there is a limit to 
the number of referenda that the A.S. Council 
can introduce 10 the ballot each year, and 
whether or nOI this would be an optimal use 
of that limit. It will also be decided if this is 
considered an A.S. Council referendum 
because it is specific to Muir college. 

Several council members called for a re-
vote on whether or not to table the legislation 
for twO weeks because "no one was clear on 
what they were voting on," according to one 
council member. 

The A.S. Council passed a vote placing the 
item on the table by a 4-1-13 vote. 

New Memben 
Sixth College announced that it has two 

new senators and a new college council chair. 
Revelle and Muir colleges announced that 

they had appointed their new freshman sena-
tors.

Alcohol: Round Table and 
Pub unaffected by changes 

continW!d fram page I 
one cannot have alcohol at all 
events." 

The revisions to the policy 
seek primarily to provide clearer 
guidelines with regard to events 
that involve alcohol , according to 
Don Chadwick, director of sports 
facilities and a member of the 
com mi ttee . 

"Some of the language was 
ambiguous," Chadwick sa id. 
"What we wanted to do was 
r<!move that ambiguity and make it 
more clear," 

Some of the changes expand 
the existing policy to include a ban 
on advertising the availability of 
alcohol at events . T he policy par-
ticularly bans advertising that 
implies the presence of alcohol 
and includes the phrases "All you 
can drink," "Beer garden" and 
"\,yine and cheese party," among 
others. 

Watson and members of the ad 
hoc committee said the reason was 
to downplay the prominence of 
alcohol at events. 

"I think it was the matter not to 
give special prominence to alcohol 
Dr the consumption of alcohol," 
Watson said. 

Other changes included the des-
ignation of both public and private 
events where alcohol is served. The 
tiling date for a public event was 
extended from three weeks before 
the event to four weeks before 
whi le the tiling dale for private 
events is three weeks before the 
event. 

Additionally, even ts at which 
alcohol is served are now allowed in 
residential areas of campus with the 
approval of the director of Housing 
and Dinir,g Services. 

Both Watson and Chadwick 

stated that the policy changes 
would not affect the status of 
ei ther Porter 's Pub or Round 
Table Pizza, both of which are 
permitted to serve alcohol on cam-
pus. 

"They're listed as an exception 
because they have their own 
license," Chadwick said. 

The changes to the alcohol and 
mal t beverage policy are part of a 
larger examination and revision of 
the UCSD Policy and Procedure 
Manual. 

Sally Brainerd, chair of rhe 
committee and associate con-
troller of the university, noted 
that parts of the Policy and 
Procedures Manual referred to 
offices that no longer exist, such 
as the business office, and for this 
reason needed to be brought up to 
date. 

"What we're trying to do is 
align them to what the needs are 
currently and to assign them to the 
various offices across campus as 
appropriate," Brainerd said. 

The committee is seelcing com-
ments from the UCSD community 
through the end of October, before 
the new policy is implemented . An 
Oct. 14 e-mail noti fied the student 
body of the changes, but of 13 
responses only two were from stu-
dents, Brainerd said. 

Other members of the commit-
tee who worked on the alcohol and 
malt beverage policy revisions are 
Steve Evans of University Events 
Office, Anne Mayer of Business 
l nd Financial Services, Dave Rose 
of the UCSD police department, 
Jon Schmidt of Environmental 
Health & Safety, Ginger Truschke 
of real estate development and 
alternate Al Jenkins of the UCSD 
police department.

UCSD travelers get discount 
on airline ticket prices 

Travel officials say Internet prices are still less expensive 
By MEUSSA BANIQUED 

Contributing Writer 

People traveling on official 
UCSD business now have the 
option of purchasing airline tickets 
priced at discounted sta te fares. 

State fares are state-contracted 
airfares for use by business travel-
ers whose travel expenses are paid 
for by either. the state of California 
or the University of California. 
They are limited to certain city 
pairs designated by the state and 
can be purchased through UCSD's 
partner agency, Balboa Travel. 
Discounted rates are available for 
263 city pairs. 

Employees, students and non-
employees traveling to or from 
UCSD on business are eligible for 
the discoun ted rates. This incl udes 
nonsalary employees, teaching 
assistants, students going to con-
ferences and visitors invited to 
UCSD, according to Dawn 
McDevitt, travel program coordi-
nator for Balboa Travel. 

According to Disbursements 
Division Manager Faye 
McCullough, UCSD business 
travel specifically refers to "autho-
rized travel that accomplishes a 
bona fide university purpose." 

Nonbusiness travel, such as 
leisure travel for students, does not 
apply to the contracts, 
McCullough said. 

State fares are less restrictive 
airline tickets purchased online. 
There are no restrictions for 
advance purchasing, and tickets 
are fully refundable. 

They are not, however, always 
the cheapest rates available and are 
also limited to United and 
Southwest Airlines. Those consid-
ering using state fares are encour-
aged by the travel providers to 
compare prices and look for spe-
cial Internet promotions first. 

"We want to make sure people 
are looking at all options," 

" We're trying to save the 
university money_So 

why would we use state 
I. 1/1 Jares , -- . 
-JudiG~,Unwe~Evenb 

McDevin said, "not just jumping 
into it." 

University Events Business 
Manager Judi Griffith cited the 
school's tight budget as reason not 
to use the state fares. 

"We're trying to save the uni-
versity money," Griffith said . "So 
why would we use [the state fa res] 
when we can get cheaper prices on 
the lnternet?" 

Griffith herself considered 
using the state fares for a flight 
from San Diego to Oakland, Calif. 
Comparing state fares and Internet 
fares, she found cheaper prices 
online. 

Srudent Organi zations 

Accounts Specialist Sandy Ray. a 
former employee of the University 
Travel Accounts Oflice, warned 
that Internet prices are unstable 
and can change as seats fill up Dn a 
flight. She said she knew of one 
occasion in which an airline ti cket 
fare on the Internet went up $200 
within one hour. 

Ray further noted that when 
comparing state fares With 
Internet fares, it is important to 
look at the prices for d1e same 
flight time, not just fli ghts on the 
same day with the same destina-
tion. Al.,o, the later ;1 flight is 
booked, the higher the online rate. 
In this aspect, state fares are 
preferable over Internct fares. 

Ray also believes that for those 
who travel freq uentl y, going 
through Balboa Travel and using 
state fares is probably easier. 

The state has had a contracted 
ai rfare program for spccific city 
pairs for several years, 
McCullough said. This past year, 
the University of California Office 
of the President advi ed that this 
program be made avail:ible to UC 
campuses. 

The most popular destinations 
for UCSD trave lers Jre San 
Francisco and Oakland. Usi ng 
tate fares, a roundtrip ticket from 

San Diego to San Francisco COSt 
$134; to Oakland, $168. These 
prices do not include a service fee 
of $15 or other applicable fees.

The UCSD Guardian IS published twice a week at the University of

represent the malorlty vote of the editorial board and are not necessar-

Troupe merits 
punishment from 
UCSD, not Calif. 

After admitting that he lied on his 
resume about earning a college degree, 
UCS D literature professor Quincy Troupe 
resigned as state poet laureate nominee. 
Though Chancellor Robert C. Dynes will 
decide Troupe's punishment, if there is one, 
no verdict has been announced yet. 

Although Troupe doesn't have a college 
degree, the Guardian feels that this should 
have no bearing on his eligibility or ~ualifi­
cations for the position of California s poet 
laureate. The only factor that should be con-
sidered when choosing a poet laureate is the 
quality of the nominee's writing, not his or 
ner education. Troupe remains Just as quali-
fied for the position as he was before thedis-
crepancy on his resume was discovered, 
because his poetry remains just as laudable. 

However, there is no doubt that the uni-
versity must punish Troupe for lying on his 
resume. The University of California has 
strict honor codes that apply to both stu-
dents and staff. When a student is discov-
ered to have falsified information on an 
application or lied about whether academic 
work is his or her own, the penalties are 
swift and severe. It would be an appalling 
double standard if Troupe were not subject 
to the same treatment. Furthermore, it 
would imply that once students enter the 
workforce, lying is an acceptable practice. 

Because Troupe has already proven him-
self a gifted and dedicated professor, firing 
him would punish both him and the stu-
dents who enjoy his classes and teaching 
style. Just as students being reprimanded for 
the same crime would likely not be expelled, 
Troupe should not necessarily be fired. 
However, it would be appropriate to modi-
fy his standing at the university by down-
grading him from a professorship to an 
associate professorship, with resultant con-
sequences to pay and tenure. 

The Guardian would find it reprehensible 
if Troupe were not disciplined for lying on 
his resume. However, the fact that he did so, 
and the fact that he does not have a college 
degree, should in no way have affected his 
poet laureate nomination, since his poetic 
accomplishments and not his education ren-
der him deserving of that position.

Obesity needs more attention, higher priority 
Encourage health, but don't demonize overweight 

8y MARIANNE MADDEN 
Contributing Writer 

It's taken countless days spent entire-
ly behind desks, greasy meals wolfed 
down in front of the TV; and evenings 
spent watching sports games rather than 
playing them, but we've finally done it: 
Overweight Americans now oumumber 
those who aren't by nearly a two-to-one 
margin, according to National Health 
and Nutrition Examination surveys. 

Worldwide, there are one billion 
overweight people, and recent NHNE 
surveys also report that about 15 percent 
of children ages six to 19 are overweight. 
What to do? Public health organizations 
may broadcast one message, but fast 
food commercials preach quite another 
- and the latter command much more 
power over the average American. 

In the case of child obesity, preven-
tion is paramount - and parents, not 
children, are responsible for it. Kids 
don't sign themselves up for soccer, vol-
untarily ignore the TV OT drive to 
Whole Foods to stock up on health 
food . Instead, they imitate their par-
ents' lifestyles and eating habits, which 
are often deplorable. Children possess 
both a love for junk food and enormous 
sway in the grocery store when shop-
ping with their parents. Yet parents can 
have complete control over the diets of 
their offspring, and if kids begin life 
with healthy diets, t11ey're likely to eat 
well for the rest of their lives. 

The reality is that most parents don't 
exert any positive influence on their kids' 
eating habits; either they pass on 
wlhealthy habits or are spineless when it 
comes to refusing requests for junk food . 
in the case of weight, a staunch parent 
goes a long way - indeed, a lifetime. 

Obesity in otherwise healthy children 

, 

- ......... --

NATIONAL 
is indicative of unhealthy, irresponsible 
parents. Adullli are perfectly welcome to 
maintain any sort of body they like -
more on that later. But when a person is 
shaping a child's life, they have a respon-
sibility to make that shape a positive one. 

It's clear that nothing short of a fun-
damental change in the .American 
lifestyle will cUrb adult and, by exten-
sion , childhood obesity. In the mean-
time, though, we may as well accept the 
present situation. 

We can start by acknowledging that 
it's cruel and unethical to preach that 
any adult's body shape "needs correc-
tion ." It's a conscious adults preroga-
tive to maintain an unhealthy body, 
which leads to an early death . 

In society's view, early death is fine; 
early death from obesity, however, is not. 
We idolize the model, the rock star and 
the athlete - all of whom gain more 
acclaim the more they abuse their bodies. 
When rock stars die of overdoses, models 
wither before our eyes and athletes tear 
lip their bodies beyond belief, we forgive 

and idolize them. But when an over-
weight person dies of a heart attack, we 
connect the two factors - disregarding 
the fact that "heart disease has a lot more 
to do with genetics and the lipid profile 
than with obesity," as stated by Dr. Felix 
Kolb of University of California at San 
Francisco School of Medicine - and 
condemn the "bad choices" the person 
made. We only consider them bad choic-
es, however, because they lead to a body 
that American society dictates is ugly. 

As a group, Americans hate their 
bodies - and not only that, but they 
hate other peoples' bodies too. We hate 
skinny bodies for being "beautiful," but 
a speciallcind of hate is reserved for fat 
people; skinny people, we reason, have 
at least achieved conventional beauty. 
Fat has no place in the aesthetic ideal of 
America, so there is no braver social 
deviant than the overweight person 
who is content with their body. 

Society dictates that fat people 
should hide in their houses and try to 
find salvation in altering their looks. But 
this simply doesn't happen - and we 
hate fat people for leading normal, 
rewarding lives. Those lives may be cut a 
few years short, of course, but not every-
one wants to live until they're 90, espe-
cially if they're enjoying their time on 
Earth by eating deliciously unhealthy 
foods and not bothering themselves with 
push-ups and early morning runs. 

But here lies the rub: As the number 
of overweight and obese people rises, so 
does the strain on our medical system. 
Worldwide, "at least 17 million people 
died from [obesity-related) causes in 
1999 - 2.3 million more than died 
from cardiovascular disease in 1990," 
reports the UK Guordian. Maybe ir'~

THURSOAY, OCTOBER 24. 2002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Administration threatens student rights 

Parisa Baharian 
On OCt. 29, the academic fates 

of all UCSD students \vill be in the 
hands of the Representative 
Assembly. 

The Academic Senate's 
Committee on Educational Policy's 
proposal, which dismantles the 
UCSD Policy on Integrity of 
Scholarship, will be up for a vote. 

Through its proposal, the CEP 
effectively annuls the current sys-
tem and proposes a new system of 
academic dishonesry procedures 
that is completely alien and hostile 
to the inherent due process rights 
guaranteed to students. 

Under the current procedures 
outlined in the UCSD Policy on 
Integrity of Scholarship, if a profes-
sor suspects you of having commit-
ted academic dishonesty, he or she 
contacts your dean with suspicions 
and evidence. The dean calls you in 
for a meeting, where you are offered 
an informal resolution (known in 
the real world as a plea agreement), 
where you admit responsibility and 
accept the offered minimum sanc-
tions. Otherwise, if you are innocent 
or feel the punishment is too harsh, 
you can request a formal hearing 
before the Academic Dishonesry 
Hearing Board. If the hearing board 
finds enough evidence to merit a 
verdict of guilt, your dean then 
decides the administrative penalties 
to be imposed. 

However, under the new CEP 
proposal, the academic dishonesty 
procedures are centralized in the 
office of the Student Conduct 
Coordinator, thereby removing the 
deans' responsibilities from the 

process and to their students, 
instead entrusting god-like powers 
to the SCC, who acts as the prose-
cutor and executioner. . ' 

The all-important separation of 
powers inherent in the current sys-
tem , in which the deans are pre-
cluded from both prosecuting and ' 
imposing sanctions, is noneKistent 
in the proposed system under the 
domain of the SCc. 

All bets are off; the lines of sep-
aration are permanently erased. 
The SCC not only determines 
whether to bring charges, but also 
prosecutes the case if it goes to the 
hearing board, and in the event of a 
guilty verdict, the SCC then deter-
mines the sanctions. 

How convenient for the admin-
istration to have a prosecutor and 
executioner all in one office. The 
requisite impartiality to impose a 
sentence will be wholly absent if 
this radical change is implemented. 
The very act of the SCC in prose-
cuting the case against a student 
nixes the neutrality that is required 
in order to determine a fair and 
non punitive sanction. 

Any conflict of interest the SCC 
may have are of no apparent interest 
to the Academic Senate. But it must 
be a matter of grave concern for the 
Representative Assembly, for allow-
ing this all-mighty power to be cen-
tered in one set of hands is not only 
reckless and foolhardy, but also ille-
gal under the due process provisions 
ofUC General Policy 103.10. 

lbe CEP proposal is so ridden 
with flaws that it puts the academic 
future of every student at risk . 

The belittled role of the deans 
in the CEP proposal gives rise to 
the increased role of the f2culty. 
The faculty members bringing the 
charges are no longer mere com-
plainants; they now play an active 
part in the formation of the admin-
istrative penalties for academic 

misconduct. By heavily involving 
the very professor who accused the 
s1}ldem in the first place, it breaks 
the required standard of impartiali-
ty of the proceedings, thus render-
ing the outcome as nothing but 
vindictive, preferential and unjust. 

With these grand assaults on the 
due process rights of students, the 
very legitimacy that is needed ro 
make the proceedings fair and just 
is effectively null and void. 

Without the fundamental due 
process safeguards and protections 
in place, a climate of fear will reign 
because no one will be safe. 

The UCSD Policy on Integrity 
of Scholarship is like our Bill of 
Rights. JUSt as we would be helpless 
and defenseless to arbitrary govern-
ment attacks without being able to 
hold up our amendments as a shield 
of protection, so too can we not sur-
vive on this., campus without fair 
procedures set forth in our Integrity 
of Scholarship Bill of Rights. 

Even though the CEP proposal. 
only immediately affects those stu-
dents who are charged with acade-
mic misconduct, it doesn't excuse 
the rest of us to mindlessly play at 
recess while the university elimi-
nates many fundamental rights. 

The rights of every srudent will 
be on the chopping Itlock Oct. 29. 
And it will take a community of 
united students to influence the 
Representative Assembly to affirm 
our Integriry of Scholarship Bill of 
Rights, not dismantle it one right at 
a time. 

We all win or we all lose. 
Whats it going to be? 

This columnist asks that any issues 
of concern within our school, nation 
or world to be brought to her atten-
tion. Only the serious and passion-
ately committed need reply to pbo-

OPINION 5 

LmERS TO THE EDITOR 
Seible's letter ignored 
UCSD's corporate ties 

Edito: 
In the Oct. 14 issue, Frieder 

Sei ble addressed in a letter to the 
editor rwo aspects of Simone 
Santini's recent aTticle criticizing 
the engineering school's close 
industry ties. First, he replies at 
great length to a flippant remark 
about Mr. Jacobs, a major donor. 
While Santini 's comment was 
perhaps unfair, and -the reply 
therefore justified, the issue is 
essentially irrelevant. 

Unfortunately, this minor 
issue distracted from the sub-
stance of the editorial, an argu-
ment that by training young tech-
nicians rather than young 
thinkers, and by focusing on 
immediately applicable "skill 
sets," the school does its srudents 
a disservice. I believe that this 
view may be shared by many stu-
dents and instructors, and cursory 
research shows that it is not 
unjustified. In particular, the 
Jacobs School and the Cal-IT(2) 
initiative give the appearance of: 
conflicts of interest in choosing 

partner companies, severely limit -
ed research horizons, and open 
sale of the undergraduate cllrricu-
lum. 

First, the 2000 Cal-IT(2) pro-
posal lists seven associated "key 
small privately held companlc,": 
Caimus, Entropia; Global 
Photon, MedExpert, Panoram 
Technologies, Silicon Wave and 
TeraBurst Nerworks. Of these, 
Cal-IT(2) Director Larry Smarr 
is on the boards of twO (Entropia 
and MedExperr), and three 
(En tropia, MedExpert and 
Silicon Wave) were started by 
current or former UCSD faClllty. 
It seems unJikely, though certain-
ly possible, that Smarr is on the 
boards of two out of every seven 
small high-tech firms in the area, 
and that nearly half are started by 
faculty. 

Second, the same proposal 
states that "we will work at the 
frontiers of the new Internet 
telecommunications infrastruc-
ture at least three to five years 
ahead of commercial practice, yet 
tightly coupled to long-term basic

Letters: Conservatives not 
clamoring for professorships 

concinued (ram page 5 
research that will lay the founda-
tion for products five to 10 years 
into the future," This degree of 
foresight is similar to or less than 
that allowed at corporate labs like 
Microsoft Research, Students 
should be aware that their view of 
research extends only to these hori-
zons. 

The third issue, open curricu-
lum-buying, seems most disturb-
ing. Strong military-industrial 
influences have long been a fact of 
basic research, and are arguably 
necessary in an era of tight budgets 
and expensive science. But it seems 
both unexpected and disturbing 
that corporate dollars (openly) 
decide what undergraduates learn. 
How many undergraduate engi-
neers believe they are paying for a 
particular company's job-training 
program) The engineering school's 
Corporate Affiliates Program's 
Web page offers member compa-
nies uleadership opportunities," 
including ucurriculum develop-
ment" and "company-sponsored 
design projects as part of [the 1 cur-
riculum." Wtll it always be dear 
which parts of the curriculum are 
usponsored"? 

This approach is also popular 
with Cal-(IT)2 sponsors : 
"According to Nokia, 'The uni-
versity has been open and respon-
sive to the needs of industry, and 
has initiated new curricula at the 
suggestion of [ourl board. 
Programs initiated through Cal-
(In2 will help UCSD ed ucate 
students in the ski ll sets our com-
panies need .'" Students should ask 
themselves if these "skill sets" are 
what they are paying the universi-
ty to teach, and how useful th ese 
"skill sets" will be in five or 10 
years' time. 

Seibl e says that the concerned 
student is "certainly entitl ed to 
his opinion on the marte r." 
However, I believe UCSD 's cur -
rent and prospective engi neers 
are also entitled to a clea r, open 
an d critical evaluation of what 
they arc buying, and of what is 
being sold .

Political registration of 
profs is largely irrelevant 
Editor: 

Re: "UCSD's profs mostly lib-
eral" (Oct. 21 issue of the 
GUllrdi,,,,) . Dustin Frelich criti-

cizes the lack of conservative pro-
fessors at UCSD, the UC system 
in general and American universi-
ties. 

Is there a large group of unem-
ployed conservative professors, 
who, because of their politica l 
views, are not being hired? Frelich 
does not mention such a group, nor 
does he have information about the 
hiring of professors at this or any 
other university, aside from a heav-
ily edited UC policy statement. on 
diversity. 

Without having any such infor-
mation myself, I would assume 
there simply aren't many comerva-
tive professors. People with more 
education tend to be more liberal. 
College students generally are 
more liberal than the rest of the 
population. Why would these ten-
dencies disappear for those with 
doctorates who go on to become 
professors' 

Frelich's suggestion of affirma-
tive action [0 promote political 
diversity is insulting to the inten-
tions of affirmative action. It's hard 
to argue that political conserva-
tives have had any barrie rs pre-
venting careers as university pro-
fessors. 

I cannot speak for anyone else 
about Frelich 's demand that our 
education be "fair and balanced," 
but personally, I believe one pur-
pose of education is to gain an 
understanding of the way the 
world works. This requires us to 
challenge commonly accepted 
assumptions and explanations, 
which in many cases are consid-
ered "li beral" because the com-
mon assllmptions are "conserva-
tive." 

T hat sa id, I have not yet had a 
professor who seemed to be bla-
ta ntly ignoring the other side of an 
issue. Frelich excluded hard sci-
ence, bur the professor for my non-
major hi ology class las t year even 
went so far as to skirt around the 
topic of evolution , wanting to avoid 
any controversy. 

I don 't know about frclich's 
political bcnt, but hi complaint 
seems to he a common one among 
conserva tives . Perhaps co nserva-
tives could devote mo re time 
either to becomi ng professors 
themselves or urging their ideo-
logical coll eagues to do so. 
Arguing as if there is bias in hiring 
will continue to get them 
nowhere.

Obesity: 
Adults must 

be responsible 
for health 

continued from page 4 
heartless to say that treatment for a 
disease stemming from obesity is 
too little, too late. But the only real 
way to battle obesity-related dis-
eases is with radical improvements 
in lifestyle, and if an otherwise 
healthy adult has neglected their 
health long enough to fall ill , 
there 's little chance that treatment 
will work. 

The bottom line is that adults 
need to take responsibility: first, for 
their bodies and lifestyles by antici -
pating (and preventing, if they so 
wish) the hea lth 'problems their 
life tyle is going to causc; and scc-
ondly, for the health of their chil -
dren. When a child is cursed from 
the start by irrespon ible parenting, 
the real tragedy surface . But once 
you 're a conscious adult, you' re 
frec to respect or abuse your body 
in whatever way you want.

volunteer expo: The annual Volunteer Expo on Library Walk attracted students 
on Oct. 22. The event was sponsored by the A.S. Volunteer Connection. 

Volunteer Connection had 
been preparing for this event since 
the summer. The expo attracted 
approximately 25 more agencies 
to UCSD than last year. Over 
1,000 students visited the booths 
and ~igned up to request fu rther 
information. 

The only surprises were unan-
ticipated religious clubs at the 
expo. The A.S . Volunteer 
Connection had initially tried to 
avoid combining religion into the 

volunteer event. 
T he turnout was more than 

expected , organizers said, even 
with the 311 concert taki ng place 
at Warren Field at the same time 
as the expo.

TI IUR DAY, OCTOBER 24. 2002 

By JONATHAN JOSEPHSON 
Contributing Writer 

As surpri smg as it may be to 
many, "Whose Li ne is it 
Anyway" antl "" ayne Brady's (3 
former T heatreSports per -
former) new daytime talk show 
are not the end-all, be-all of 
comedic improvisation. 

T he first annllal 
International TheatreSports 
Institute Conference and All 
Star Games took place this 
weekend in Hillcrest, just a few 
miles and three freeways away 
from UCSD. With this confer-
ence, San Diego was the chosen 
location for the major meeting 
of the minds of improvisational 
theater representatives from 
around the world. 

Though it is popular, impro-
visational theater has yet to be 
included in mainstream popular 
theater. T h.is is the dilemma that 
causeJ the creative minds 
behind Thea treSports to form 
the conference to discuss both 
artistic and adnlinisrrative prob-
lems of performers, artistic 

directors and managing direc-
tors from all walks of life to 
piece together how to improve 
tht: univcrse of improv. 

Over the weekend, rwo 
T heatreSports comlTunees (one 
artistic and one management-
oriented) revealed and discussed 
the problems that they fa ce 
within the theater world. They 
found the chief management 
problems to be getting publicity, 
accru.ing funding or sponsor-
sh.ip, and receiving the respect 
of the community in which they 
perform. The major challenges 
that plague the artistic managers 
are building an ensemble, 
upholding artistic integrity and 
training new improvisers. 
Several of these problems were 
addressed in the All Star Gamer 
that supplemented the confer-
ence. 

A. handful of San Diego 
patrons got a taste of "theatrical 
insanity" with an exceedingly 
talented international cast of 
improvisers at Swedenborgian 
Hall in H.i II crest. Players from 
Japan and New Zealand joined

String Cheese Incident will peel off their unique sounds at RIMAe Arena 
The bluegrass jam band offers up a plate of their eclectic music 

By CLAYTON WORFOLK 
Contributing Writer 

Des pite their long history as a 
coll ege music staple, jam bands 
have seen little action at UCSD in 
years past. No more, says the 
University Events Office, which 
welcomes Colorado bluegrass jam-
mers T he String Cheese Incident 
to RIMAC Arena on Oct. 29. 

SCI was fou nded in 1993 by 
mandoli ni stlvioli nist Michael 
Kang, guita ri t Bill Nershi, bassist 
Keith Mose ley, pianist Kyle 
Hollingsworth and percussionist 
Michacl Travis. If the band's 
unique instrumentation isn't 
enough to immediately warrant 
jam band credentials, SCI have the 
live chops (not to mention the 
beards) to prove it. 

Like contemporaries Ph.ish and 
Leftover Salmon, SCI have 
emerged from the influential shad-
ow of improvisatory' entrepreneur 
the Grateful Dead over the last 
decade to gather a cult fanfare of 
their own, the ultimate measure of 
success in their show-oriented 
genre. The bands dedication to 
bluegrass is their most defining 
characteristic, but they also prides 
themselves on mixing calypso, salsa, 
Afro-pop, funk, rock and jazz into 
their musical equation. 

SCI has released three studio 
albums over the last five years, the 
majority of which the ba.nd pro-
duced and put out themselves on 
their independent SCI Fidelity 
record label. Their latest endeavor, 
2001 's "Outside Inside," has been 
hailed as the band's most focused 

record, a flowing I I-track set that 
retains the band's live sound even in 
a studio setting. 

In additi on, SCI recently 
released over 3. dozen three-disc 
"On the Road" performances 
chronicling their tour earlier t1us 
year. It goes ,vi thout saying that 
these arc the most accurate repre-
sentations of the e.~ansive live SCI 
ound. 

"The jam band style of music 
hasn't really been represented at 
UCSD," said VEO Assistant 
Director Katherine Lee, who is 
organizing the event. 

The concert is one of the first 
tock hows sponsored by VEO 
th.is year. General admission tick-
ets for the 7:30 p.m. performance

Knoxville talks about "jackass" 
Revealed: Secrets of the group that brought you Jackass 

By JESSICA KRUSKAMP 
Senior Staff Writer 

Oct. 25 signifies two things: It is the open-ing for "jackass the movie," and quite possibly the end of Western civilization. 
Mark your calendars! 

Paramount Pictures and M1V Films have 
formed a cinema hegemon by coming 
together for the movie version of this televi-
sion phenomenon. It is a naughtier version of 
what is showl) on MTV, and comes complete 
with a punk, rock and hip-hop soundtrack. 

Johnny Knoxville leads his pain-hungry, 
willing-to-get-naked troupe to locations 
around the globe, from California to Japan, 
to pull all the stunts. The original cast from 
the TV show join him on his quest for the 
enlightened state of jackassdom. Bam 
Margera , Chris Pontius, Steve-O, Dave 
England, Ryan Dunn, Jason "Wee-Man" 
Acuna , Preston Lacy and Ehren McGhehey 
are all featured in the movie. 

Don't worry, no one with actual sense 
slipped in. 

Though Knoxville had been on a whirl-
wind publicity tour (so far, he said his major 
injury was an engorged liver), he took some 
time to chat with the Guardia". 

Do you get paid for the stunts that you 
do, or is pain its own reward? 

Knoxville: Uh, we work for free so, uh, so 
I don't really know what you are saying. 

[And with that, Johnny proves he may 
have taken too many bricks to the head. 
Though the question was not sevmly mind-
bending, the questions must be simpler and 
more straight-forward. The question about 
his thoughts on fiscal policy is thrown out the 
window.} 

TeU me about "jackass the movie." 
Any deep story plots? 

K: "jackass the movie" will be like 
"Jackass" the show, only the naughty version. 
A naughty, 90-minute version - no plot, no 
narrative and just one naughty idea after 
another. 

Does your entourage draw much 
attention during a stunt or prank? 

K: With stunts, it doesn't really matter if 
they draw attention. People are so engrossed 
in the stunts, they don't even notice that the 
cameras are pointed right at them. With 
pranks, our guys are really good about film-
ing on the sly with handheld cameras. It is 
amazing what you can do with a handheld. 

Give me an idea of the cJ'llziness in you 
life. 

K: One of our favorite things we have 
ever done closes the film. Steve-O, who usu-
ally gets the naughtiest things, turned it 
down, so Ryan Dunn took one for the team. 
I don't want to give it away, but yuu will 
never look at toy cars or Dunn the same 
again. 

How are the stunts perfonned? 
K: All our stunts are performed sober. 

Granted, some of the guys watching in the 
peanut gallery might not be so sober, but 
whoever is performing the mmt is sober. 

Are you expecting a lot of controversy 
with the movie? 

K: No, I don't think so. We have an R rat-
ing, and we weeded out a lot of the impres-
sionable kids. We were leery to putting 
things that were easy to imitate in there. This 
is what the show should have been. Uohnny 
gets mathematical.] It is the show to the 10th 
power. 

Are there any limits? 
K: Well, yeah. Once, we saw a picture on 

the Internet where an elephant sat on a guy's 
head. The guy's head went right up his ass. 
So of course, we tried to see if we could put 
Steve-D 's head up an elephant's ass, but he 
regretfully declined. Other than that ... no. 

Was there anything you couldn't put in 
the movie? 

K: We shot with Jean Labell, a world 
champion kung fu and legendary 
Hollywood stuntman. He came by and 
choked out the enti re cast. It seemed hilari-

Artful French film is delightful 
Film color and plot entwine in this new masterpiece 

By NEHA SINGH 
Contributing Writer 

After viewing "[n Praise of Love," it is clear why director Jean-Luc Godard is so esteemed in his field . His film is a 
fascinating meditation on love and the nature 
of human consciousness. 

The abstract concept on which the film is 
based is the dissect of love into the following 
four categories: the meeting, physical passion, 
quarrels and reconciliation. Shot in elegant 
black and white 35-millimeter film, the first 
part of Godard's meditation is about Edgar's 
(Bruno Putzulu) self-appointed task to capture 
these moments after a recent breakup and to 
define a central idea: "It's only when things are 
over that they make sense. " 

When Edgar starts reminiscing about a 
holiday two years ago, the fi lm switches to a 
vibrantl y saturated color digital video. 
Traditionally, directors would use black and 
white film to depict the past, but Godard 
wisely choose to do the contrary. Color is 
used symbolically to show that Edgar is the 
most alive two years before the time the film 
starts. In the beginning, he is on a creative 
high; the nearly pulsating, raw colors repre-
senting his own "pure" state. He has recently 
conceived the idea for his project and is expe-
riencing love at first sight with the nameless 
woman he wants to cast in his project. 1\vo 
years later, Edgar finds himself frustrated 
both personally and professionally. The black 

Film 
REVIEW 

and white represents the dullness of his life; 
he uses every opportunity to discuss his plans, 
yet he fails to act. This quality is his greatest 
shortcoming, and Godard delivers the dor-
mant mood of thi s first part beautifully 
through the black and white film . Scenes in 
the beginning are very defined; in the second 
hal f, ideas, scenes and intense colors are 
spilling into one another, effortlessly spread-
ing their energy to the audience. The film is 
composed of shorr vignettes, which add to the 
whimsical mood and abstract tone of the film . 

The one disadvantage of watching this 
movie as a non-French speaker is that certain 
scenes are difficult to follow. However, the 
film's sheer physical and intellectual beauty 
leaves the viewer satisfied and even making 
plans to see it again.

'Auto Focus' turns out a bit hazy 
An overall good effort at a fundamentally weak story 
By ROBERT SPENCER PFORSICH 

Contributing Writer 

A film that opens with the wholesome vision of a disc jockey interviewing the Lone Ranger and ends with a dead man 
spilling blood all over his hotel room has a 
long way to go for the viewer to believe his 
protagonist could change so much. Bur Greg 
Kinnear's depiction of Hogan's Heroes star 
Bob Crane goes practically nowhere. 

In "Auto Focus," based on the book "The 
Murder of Bob Crane" by Robert Graysmith, 
Kinnear ("As Good as it Gets," "Loser") 
teams up with Willem Dafoe ("Spider-Man," 
"Shadow of the Vampire"), who plays Cranes 
best friend and eventual murderer. With a 
cast like this , I anticipated greatness. 

I was impressed by Dafoe's depiction of his 
character, John Carpenter, whose latent 
homosexual urges toward Crane and his sym-
bolic obsession with a technological age that 
will inevitably leave him behind propel his 
pathetic and stagnant lifestyle toward killing 
his best friend . I was honestly given the creeps. 

But Dafoe's stellar ability was not mir-
rored by Kinnear, who is the type of actor 
that does not soar when stretched beyond his 
bounds. His character makes sudden leaps 
from a sober, wholesome family man to an 
orgiastic party freak, to a burnt-out, tired old 
man without any sense of transition or indi-
cation where he might go next. Rather than 
bringing us down with him, we get left 
behind, shaking our heads in disgust. 

As for director Paul Schrader ("American 
Gigolo"), he did what he could with a funda-
mentally unsound premise. The story of a 

Film 
REVIEW 

man whose career only saw success for six 
years and who was then bludgeoned to death 
with a tripod is not necessarily one I would 
call filmworthy. However, Schrader's di rec-
tion keeps the film afloat - if only just bare-
ly. The camera work mirrors the emotional 
state of the characters; the occasional dream 
sequence/mental freakout gave us insight 
into how out of control our hero really was. 
The film's varying range of lighting tech-
niques keeps the visuals fresh . 

In a movie where you know the main 
character is going to get killed, the last thing 
you want is to find yourself waiting for that 
to happen. I was anticipating it about half an 
hour before it actually came. And when it did 
come, it was out of the blue. 

This film was not all bad. I didn't walk out 
on it. But considering the talent behind it -
in both acting and directing - it fell short of 
its potential.

'60s-style garage rock and '70s 
punk when Internalional NOise 
Conspiracy perform their brand of 
an Icapltalistlc musIc at The Scene 
tonight. The Swedish band has 
come under much attack because 
of their outspoken political views 
and their commerCial efforts. If you 
want to judge for yourself, shell out 
the $10.75 and see them tOnight 
when their show starts at 6:30 p.m. 

Abandon all common notions 
of landscape and design and viSit 
the University Art Gallery at 
Mandeville Center for the revolu-
tionary Representing Landscape 

exhibition. The show will feature· six 
international artists who work in 
paint and sculpting to widen the 
idea of landscape. The opening

There's nothing better than 

wallowing in sad emo or jumping 
about to frantic punk music on a 
Friday night. One of the original 
punk bands from Orange County, 
Agent Orange, has become a 
highly respected punk band with a 
strong fan base, since they have 
been around for almost 20 years. 
And for a measly $10, you can join 
their loyal fans who will be cheer-
ing them on when they perform at 
Bnck by Bnck tonight at 8 p.m. 

@~_~sa.;...;..tu~r=.da~y 
Get in the spirit of Halloween 

and learn something about cul-
ture as well at the Dias de los 
Muertos celebration at the Bazaar 
del Mundo. With Mexico only a 
short car ride away, and a large 
Latino/ Chicano population in San 

bea 

Diego, it is only right that an event 
like this bring fun and education 
families and anyone who is inter-
ested. The event will feature arts 
and crafts, including sugar skull 
sculptin& and there will be many 
art and cultural displays. A special 
tribute will also be paid to 
Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. The 
event runs until Nov. 2. For more 
Information call (619) 296-3266. 

The exciting band Drive By 
Truckers will play at 4th and B 
with Gov't Mule tonight, having 
garnered accolades since the 
release of their album Southern 
Rock Opera on Lost Highway 
Records in 2001 . With musIc that 
addresses stereotypes and myths 
associated with the South in their 
unique Southern rock music, 
Drive By Truckers have been able 
to produce praiseworthy music 
while still tackling controversial 
subjects. Tickets are $20 and the 
show starts at 9 p.rn.

Black dothes, massive amounts 

of makeup and lots of swearing. 
No, it's not the 'The Rocky Horror 
Picture Show:' British band The 
Damned is coming to San Diego. 
The gothic punk band of the late 
'70s never quite made it to stable 
fame, but they did score a few hits, 
such as "New Rose" and "Srpash it

stay together for lon& they are now 
making another attempt to bring 
themselves back together to tour 
and promote their latest undertak-
ing: Eternal Damnation Live. They 
will play at 'Canes Bar and Grill at 8 
p.m. Tickets are $18. 

Tired of meaningless, over-
played rubbish marketed as pop 
music? Well, Mason Jennings will 
change all that. Jennings, a stout-
hearted, hardcore independent 
artist, refuses to succumb to com-
mercial pressures, despite being 
praised by The New York Times or 
even being handpicked by Jack 
Johnson to open for his tour. 
Instead, he opts to write all of his 
own music (over 300 original 
songs) and tours relentlessly with 
his own band. And he's doing 
something right. because he has 
sold over 300,000 copies of his 
honest and heartfelt acoustic 
albums, recorded out of his vans 
and at his concerts. Not bad. To 
see this boy wonder, head on over 
to the Casbah, where the show 
starts at 8:30 p.m .. Tickets are $10. 

@~_.....;t;;;;.;ue;..;;;.;sd=a_y 
An almost unknown band, The 

Residents is a rather strange yet 
important group that has been 
around since the late '60s. Known 
not only for their music, the 

fiercely unique and artsy band 
has produced in numerous forms 
of media, including LPs, CDs, 
books, video catalogues and 
more. They even have a perma-
nent exhibition of their video work 
at the Museum of Modern Art in 
New Yor~ and their costumes for 
The Mole Show are on display at 
the Museum of Contemporary Art 
in Los Angeles. To see what all the 
fuss is about, go to the Belly Up 
Tavern and watch The Residents 
play at 9 p.m. Tickets are $30. 

Scottish men, Scottish music. All 
is good with the world when 
Scotland's premier cavalry march-
ing band, The Royal Scots Dragoon 
Guard, performs at the East County 
Performing Arts Center in EI Cajon. 
The 13-piece band will play classic 
songs as well as modem songs 
accompanied by Jane Burgess on 
violin. Tickets are on sale and prices 
range from $2 1 to S26. For more 
information, call the performing arts 
center at (61 9) 440-2277.

Innovation and insight give plays depth 
New one-act plays will have you laughing and crying at 6th @ Penn 

By JONATHAN JOSEPHSON 
Contributing Writer 

Don't you h:lte it when Grandma tricks the neighbor-hood Adonis into playing the 
role of your long-lost son? And 
when strange men walk up to you 
in the park, tell you their life Story, 
and then impale themselves on a 
knife you happen to be holding? 

:ntrigued' 
"The American Dream" and 

"The Zoo Story," two one-act 
plays showing at the 6th @ Penn 
T heater in downtown San Diego , 
relate such evems for both comic 
and dramatic ends. With talented 
actors and an innovat ive design 
team, the Renai ssance Theater 
Company upholds the magic and 
chaos of playwright Edward 
Albee's work. 

"The Anlerican Dream" looks at 
a day in the life of "Mommy," 
"Daddy" and "Grandma," whose 
eccentricities are as wacky and 
homespun as their names. While 

Theater 
REVIEW 

the acting is solid and very funny, 
the most eye-popping aspect of the 
opening act is its set. Fashioned 
more like a Salvador Dali painting 
than a living room, the optical illu-
sion-infused lines and colors made 
every actor standing - especially 
"Mommy" (Sandra Ellis-Troy) -
look twice as big as every player on 
stage. 

In "The Zoo Story," P eter 
(Marcus Overton), the content 
publisher, .isits his Sunday bench 
where he encounters Jerry Oeffrey 
Jones), the somewhat crazy, some-
what visionary recluse. Jerry even-
tually becomes aggressive and 
skewers himself with his own knife 
- a knife that Peter happens to be 
holding. 

Both actors in this play were 
fantastic . They were able to convey 

multidimensional characters while 
enacting incredible intensity, yet 
without crossing into hysteria. 
Jones, who carries the scene, was 
especially impressive, si nce his 
impeccable concentration emits 
both his insanity and an underlying 
tender humanity. It is this humani-
ty - the common link between the 
crazy reject and every single mem-
ber of the audience - that gives 
the play its honesty and depth. 

The 6th @ Penn Theater pro-
duction of Edward Albee's "The 
Zoo Story" and "The American 
D ream" provide kooley yet 
insightful entertainment that will 
start you both laughing and think-
ing.

Jackass: Hijinx and mayhem disclosed

ous at the time - I would go out 
drooling, convu lsi ng. Pontius got 
dropped on his head - the guy 
even choked out Wee-man! After 
watching it, it waf funny, but bor-
derline disturbing. Plus, he was 
cutting off blood supply to our 
brains and we didn 't want kids to 
know how to do that. 

How did you manage to find 
others with your penchant for 
pain? 

K: We gar Steve-O our of a cir-
cus inside a flea market in Florida. 

Usually we arc out of there so 
quick we don't have time to form a 
rapport with the people who are 
watching. We deal with cops a lot, 
bur considering the sruff we do, 

they've been pretty cool. I have 
been arrested once and have had 
guns pulled on me three times by 
three or four carloads of cops. 

There are rumors that your 
dad is a prankster. Is a certain 
story with a certain hot dog 
true? 

K: Oh, jeeze. H e is crazy and 
yes there is a hot dog story. Once, 
when I was 15, I was asleep on the 
couch. My dad warmed up a hot 
dog, came over, and ran it through 
my lips . When I suddenly woke up, 
he pretended like he was zipping up 
his pants ... Yeah. Dad has written 
a few things for the show. 

Have you ever thought to 
yourself, "Oh my God!" during 
taping? 

K: The most miserable thing I 
have ever been a part of was the 
Pontius Playgirl shoot. We shot 
Pontius for Playgi rl in various 
states of undress - cowboy boors 
and nothing else at all. Nothing' 
H e finishes off the photo shoot by 
lying in a lawn chair and fini shing 
himself off in from of six men. 
Afterwards, he jumps out of the 
lawn chair - still a mess - and 
tries to hug everybody. He was 
chasi ng me, I had a sprained ankle, 
I was running. It was ... It was just 
the most horrified I ever was on the 
show. 

ls this the last hoorah for 
"Jackass"? 

K: Yes. T his is the exclamation 
point.

Contributing Writer 

With winter weather on its way 
and midterms looming over stu-
dents' heads, UCSD wisely chose 
to have 111 lure students out of lec-
ture halls and onto Warren Field 
for the first &ee noon concert of 
the year. 

Vocalists Nick Hexwn and SA 
Martinet;. guitarist lim Mahoney, 
bassist P-Nut and drwnmer Chad 
Senon welcomed a midsize crowd 
on Oct. 22 with a wann greeting. 
"How y'all feelin'? Y'all ready for 
some lunchtime rocl,?" asked 
Hexum. 

The band laW1ched into its 16-
song set with "Freak Out," taken 
from the band's 1991 debut 
release "Music," and directly fol-
lowed with its 1996 hit "Down," 
which met with a typical solid 
crowd response of cheering and 
raised arms . The band was smiling 
and headbanging throughout, 
obviously enjoying themselves 
and playing off of the crowd's

enthusiastic response . 
"I didn't think the school had it 

in them,· said junior Olivia Yaung. 
Coming off of the steam of the 

rap-metal hybrid of "Down." the 
band shifted gears for me new 
Weez.er-esque pop song "What do 
you do?" This was a gutsy move for 
a band playing to a crowd that con-
sisted mostfy of students on their 
lunch breaks getting to see a band 
for free. 

"It's too bad the crowd isn't 
into it,· said junior Kate 
Leiserson. "It's really cooi that 
UCSD did this."" 

During some of the band's non-
singles, such as "Eons" from 19995 
"Soundsystem" LP, some people 
still bobbed their heads and danced 
a little. sometimes singing along. 
Mixed responses to the band's set 
can be partially explained by the 
fact that a sizable portion of the 
audience consisted of non-UCSD 
students who had come to see 
them. 

"I think it's awesome that i~ 
free," said UC Irvine student Judy, 

who drove down to San Diego just 
to see the show. 

Highlights of the show included 
the pretty guitar arpeggios and 
dreamy vocals of "Champagne." 
the five-person drum solo of 
"Applied Science," and the har-
monic Boston -style gui tar ri ffery 
and razor-sharp drumming of 
"Beautiful Disaster." The band's 
current radio single, "Amber," 
achieved one of the best crowd 
responses, transfixing the crowd 
with its looping guitar riff and laid-
back vocal delivery. 

"3 11 really put themselves into 
their show. They have lots of 

. energy," said UCLA student 
Vivian. 

Before the band broke into its 
closing number, vocalist Hexum 
declared, "It's called Feels ... So ... 
Good," in a voice that caused a 
number of girls to scream. 
Watching the band have fun with 
the crowd and with each other is 
what made the experience enjoy-
able, regardless of who was "into it" 
and who wasn't .

rather have the brains of an idiot 
than the face of a dog like your 
daughter." 

"Class~ Were you insinuating 
I lack c1ass~ Sorry, I couldn't hear 
clearly because the sound travels .. 
fu nny out of your mouth with all 
those teeth missing - and the 
plug of chewing tobacco doesn 't 
make it easy, either. And if I were 
you I'd wash that cow urine stain 
off your shirt when you get back 
to the ranch, too. Now what was 
that about class, partner?" 

Of course, I'd never say any 
of the e things in real life. It 
lrught have prompted the old 
man to take a swing and the law 
doesn't look kindly upon people 
in the prime of their lives scuf-
fl ing with senior citizens, but it 
baffles me that it irritated him so 
much. Sure, the team he'd dri-
ven several hours to watch sucks, 
and sure, the sooner we beat 
them the sooner he'd have to go 
back to Bakersfield, but a little 

taunting is part of the game. 
There are lines I will not 

cross when heckling, and there 
are certain things you just 
shouldn't say. I won't go into 
detail about what they are, but 
pick up The Koala and you'll 
have a prerty good idea. 

Good-natured teasing throws 
the other team off and creates a 
home-field advantage. That's 
what I'm out to produce, so I'll 
continue to do exactly what I'm 
doing. This wasn't my first run-
in with an overzealous parent, 
and it probably won't be my last.

Bring backup.

THE UCSD OUARDIAN THURSDAY, ocrOBER 24, 2002 

Cross country: Critical weekend approaches 
. continued from page 20 

all members of last year's conference squad, which fin-
ished in third place out of seven teams at the CCAA 
championships, fourth out of 18 teams at the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association Division II West 
Regional, and 15th of 24 squads at last 's years NCAA 
Division [J National Championship meet. Dunbar and 
Kalra have experience from 2000 as well, being mem-
bers of that season's third-place conference team. As a 
sophomore, Dunbar also competed as an individual at 
the NCAA national championships that year, taking 
52nd out of 181 runners, the lone men's Triton runner. 

The women's team is led by track and field All-
American Audrey Sung, who finished sixth overall at 
both the Triton Classic and last year's conference meet. 
Joining her in Bakersfield will be Lindsay Stalker, who 
finished 44th at the Classic; Erin O'Donnell (46th); 
Meghan Bellotti (51st); Lillian Gardiner (56th); Mimi 
Hodgins (57th), and Katie Bunker (65th). 

Of the seven Tritons, Gardiner, Stalker and Sung 
return from last season's conference team, whic h fin-
ished fifth out of II teams at the conference and 12th 
out of 21 teams at the West Regional , but fell short of 
qualifying for the national championship meet. Sung 
and Gardiner were teammates on the 2000 squad that 
finished fourth in conference action. 

According to UCSD head coach Ted Van Arsdale, the 
team will bring its entire 20-runner roster for morale, 
unity and in case it needs alternates due to injury. Van 
Arsdale says the runners will have the opportunity to 
compete at the West Regional regardless of where they 
finish at the conference championships this weekend. 

However, it will be up to the runners to prove that they 
belong there at Bakersfield first. If they do compete at 
regionals, where they are ranked in the top three behind 
UC Davis and Chico State, a top-three team finish will 
ensure them a berth at the NCAA championships at 
Brookside Golf Course in Ashland, Ohio, on Nov. 23.

conrimled from page 20 

Iy aren't planning on rollinlr0ver, 
which should make for an exciting 
race to the playoffs, where every 
goal counts and mistakes can cost 
the season. 

"The whole season depends on 
these next th ree games," Triton 
head coach Brian McManus said . 
"[The Ca lifornia Collegiate 
Athletic Associa tion] is probably 
the roughes t it has ever been this 
year. We're just hoping to add 
th ree [0 four poi nts [0 our [Otal in 
the next thrc ..: gJmes." 

T he Tritons currentlv have 27 
POlO tS Ul the CCAA, three more 
than CI I Poly POl11oOJ and four 
llH) l' e tholn UC Davis, their two 
c1mcsr opponents 10 the standings. 

If UCSD wins two of the next 
three games, it will be guaranteed 
at least a wild card berth in the 
playoffs. If it beats Cal Poly 
Pomona at one of those games, 
UCSD will enter the playoffs as 
the leader of the South Division of 
the CCAA. 

UCSD will host Cal State San 
Bernardino at home on Oct. 26, 
where the Tritons hope to 
improve their impressive home 
record to 9-0 and their record 
over San Bernardino this yea r to 
2-0, having sco red a victory 
against them in th is season's open-
er. 

CSUS B will be looking for 
revenge; the tClms' first meeting 
this year was a tough loss for 

UCSD to swallow. 
"They slaughtered us the first 

time," McManus said . "We only 

" The whole season 
depends on the next three 

" games, 
- Brian McManus, UCSD 

women's soccer head coach 

had two shots the whole game. 
One scored, and we won, but 
they'll definitely be looking to get 

back at us." 
McManus added that InjUrIes 

will be a big issue for the Tritons 
this weekend, mentioning that sev-
eral team members have ailments 
that range from a swollen ankle to a 
concussion . 

McManus said. "Pomona's field is 
smaller than most, as well . It will 
definitely be a physical game, but 
we hope to come out on top." 

UCSD will wrap up its season 
with a trip to Grand Canyon 
University on ov. 2. While 
Grand Canyon is riding an eight-
game losing streak at the moment, 
the team will want to end its sea-
son on a high note, and the weath-
er is guaranteed to be a factor 
there. 

After playing CSU San 
Bernardino, the Tritons will head 
up to Cal Poly Pomona, which is 
nipping at UCSD 's heels from sec-
ond place, on Ocr. 29. The last 
three games between these teams 
have resulted in Triton victories, 
but the T ritons ' road record this 
season is a less impressive 3-2, so 
this game will by no means be an 
assured victory. 

"It's always tough traveling dur-
ing the week with schoo l, " 

"1 t will be their last game of the 
senson, and they'll be playing wi th 
nothing to lose." said McM'lnus. 
"When you're the cha mpions, 
everyone wants a piece of yo u; 
G rand Canyon will come ready to 
play.'" .

Olympic: 
Student sets 
goal for 2004 

Olympics 
continued from page 20 

Continuing to balance time 
between studyin g and training, 
Herriman currently spends about six 
hours of her day at the training cen-
ter, where she paddles, lifts weights 
and runs to build the skills she needs 
for kayaking in the future. However, 
during the summer - when this stu-
dent-athlete attends most of her 
competitions - her training sched-
ule grows even more strenuous. 

Herriman became a member of 
the second-strongest kayaking team 
in the country last June, and she 
competed several times in Europe 
this summer with the seven other 
men and women paddlers on the 
squad. In Europe, where kayaking is 
popular and many clubs promote it, 
Herriman and her team participated 
in events in Germany and [taly. 

To cap off this summer's season, 
the Eleanor Roosevelt College 
sophomore recently returned from 
the Pan-American Championships 
in Brazi l, where she represented 
the United States. Raci ng in three 
four-person kayaks and one single-
person boat, Herriman earned four 
bronze medals. 

She now looks ahead to neKt 
May, the month of two qualification 
races for the 2004 O lympic Games. 
Herriman will soon choose other 
women she wants to paddle "~th , 
and then the team will begin months 
of serious training for tile qualifica-
tion races, in which the top five 
teams out of a field of 30 will earn a 
chance to compete in Athens. 

After achieving her reachable 
goals of competing in the 
Olympics, Herriman has several 
career ideas in mind . She wants to 
combine her art skills with the 
international studies degree that 
she hopes to earn . 

"I really want to do something 
with art and traveling," Herriman 
said. "I am interested in all differ-
ent kinds of cui tures." 

Also, H er riman said she is 
thinking of pursuing a modeling 
career to help publicize kayaking. 

"I want to do everything I can 
to promote my sport," Herriman 
said.

PORTS THURSDAY OCTOBER 24, 2002 
Some fans just don't 
get the big·· 

picture 
From the 
Front Row 

Bryce Warwick 

I happened to encounter one of those sorry souls a t the Oct. 18 volleyball match against Cal 
State Bakersfield. I was sining in the 
!Tom row like I always do, not m.ind-
IIlg my business, bm not being more 
uf a menace than u ual , either. 

The victim I'd chosen for the 
evel1lng was a Norwegian girl un 
the Bakersfield team whose grace-
fu lness and refinement gave off the 
Jura of a Viking princess. And trust 
me, "princess" is used very loosely. 

Anyway, Ingrid was back to serve, 
and in the typical manner of the peo-
ple of my section, I st'llrted 
yelling. This evening's particular 
cheer was "Ja, ja, Ja!" as Ingrid oblig-
ed us by striking her serving pose, 
the ball queezed between her manly 
tlni!ers and her face expressing a del-
Icate senoment best sununarized as, 
"I eat small children fo r breakfast." 

T his Norwegia n mocking of 
In(;nd amused us to no end, and in 
sp~te of ourselves, we started cheer-
Ing fo r Bakersfield so that the 
Spiking Viking could continue 
serving. Eventually she faltered and 
UCSD took the game, but that's 
exactly when the fun started. 

One of the Bakersfield parents 
wi th a digital camera strapped 
around his waist and a mean dispo-
sitIOn on his face came and stood 
right in front of me. 

"Yelling when someone is serv-
IIlg is really dumb," he growled . "It 
shows no class, and it just proves 
that you've got the brains of an 
Idiot. If you do it again, I'm gonna 
come down here and kick your ass! " 

I sat there somewhat dumb-
founded as he walked away, bm a few 
econds later I found my voice and I 

asked my friends if they'd heard 
what I JUSt had. They said they did, 
bm I repeated it just to be sure. 

"So that guy, pushing 50 in age, 
but lucky to pm up that on the 
bench press, just walked down 
here, told me I was stupid and that 
if I didn't shut up, he was going to 
hurt me?" I asked. 

A few nods confirmed exactly 
that, and then the laughter 
started. Between belly laughs, we 
gasped for air and looked back at 
the man standing several rows 
above us. When the next point 
started, we went right back to heck-
ling the Bakersfield team, and I 
know a tiny part of each of us want-
ed that old man to come back and 
try to follow through on his threat, 
but in a dazzling show of intelli-
gence, he never did. 

The rest of the match was fairly 
relaxi ng while our girls pounded on 
the CSUB losers, but it did give me 
ti me to think about what I should 
have said to that parent. 

"Excuse me sir, but did you just 
call me dumb? Last time I checked, 
your daughter went to Bakersfield, 
Jnd that seems to suggest that 
you 're contnbuting from the shal-
low end of the gene pool as far as 
Intelli 'Lnce IS concerned, so I think 
It' t il C you clo e your mouth 
before v u run out of words." 

··Why sir, you're so generous! If 
I've only got the brains of an idiot, 
that must mean you approve of the

Olympic hopes for UCSD student lie in flatwater 
Laurel Herriman trains to represent U.S. in summer games 

ByANU KUMAR 
Sports Editor 

To become an Olympian, an 
athlete needs to have talent, pas-
sion for the sport and the determi-
nation to continue to improve at 
it. 

To become an Olympian in 
kayaking, one also needs 
"strength, speed, endurance and 
technique," according to UCSD 
sophomore Laurel Herriman. 

Herriman, who began paddling 
six years ago in middle school, 
maintains a rigorous training 
schedule, hoping to qualify for 
kayaking in the 2004 Olympic 
Games. In the next Summer 
Olympics in Athens, Greece, 
Herriman hopes to be racing in a 
team boat consisting of either two 

or four paddlers in the 5OD-meter 
and IODO-meter kayaking events. 
In 2008, Herriman hopes to quali-
fy for the games in Beijing, both 
individually and with a team. 

Herriman 's first interest in 
kayaking came when she was a 13 -
year-old junior lifeguard. Her life-
guard instructor was looking for 
young athletes to become part of 
the San Diego Canoe and Kayak 
Club, which is when Herriman's 
interest in the sport sparked. 

Herriman began paddling foul' 
times a week in middle chool, but 
then her commitment to the sport 
grew in high school, when she 
went to the Arco Olympic 
Training Center in Chula Vista, 
Calif., twice a day.
