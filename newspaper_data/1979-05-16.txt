Studies Find Little Money Saved; 
Academics Still Being Checked 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
A sociale Managing Edilor 

Moves to switch the 
University of California to the 
emester ystem have 

apparenLly died. UC Presi-
dent David Saxon oppo es a 
change and studie indicate 
that a change would not save an 
appr ciable amount of money . 

Saxon told a meeting of C 
Academic Senate chairmen 
late la t month that he doe n' t 
think " there i any great 
advantage" to the erne ter 
y tern , according to UCSD 's 

campu c ha irm a n , Ru 
DoolitLle, 

And, a widely circulated C 
Irvine study indicate that the 
Irvine campus would save only 
$80,000 from a switch and that 
the ystem a a whole would 
garner saving of about 
$450,000 , " not worth the 
trouble," an Irvine admini -
trator says. 

Dennis Galligani , a special 
assistant to the Vice Chancellor 
of Academic Affairs at Irvine, 
ays that another review of the 

semester system, to determine 
it academic, rather than 
financial , advisability is 
underway, but that to the be t 
of his knowledge, "the whole 
thing is off." 

UC Berkeley , concerned 
about the ' labyrinthine and 
expensive regi tration process, 
as well a building pace, had 
been pushing the semester 
ystem hardest. 

At fir t , Michael Heyman , 
Vic Chancellor of Academic 
Affair at Berkeley , propo ed 
only that Berkeley switch tothe 
ystem , but Saxon vetoed that 
ugge tion , arguing that 
epa rating the calendars of the 

campu es would cau e too 
many administrative prob-
lem , an studies of emesters 
for the whole ystem began . 

Reg Fee Sets Final Priorities 
In addition to the saving , 

Galligani say Irvine was 
concerned about what semes-
ters would do to students living 
in Newport Beach.

'Goal Easily Met by $53,221 Recommended Increase 
By John Hondros 

Associate News Editor 
New campus residential 

units and intercollegiate 
athletics received top priority 
in the Registration Fee 
Committee' s 1979-86 budget 
recommendations to Vice 
Chanchellor of Student Affairs 
Richard Armitage. 

"The residence halls were 
unanimously assumed by the 
committee to be most essential 
to the needs of the students," 
Reg - Fee Committee Chair 
Kenzie Ni~ll said yesterday . 

After five months of hearing 
all the Student Affair units ' 
requests, the committee voted 
to review everything together 
to establish its priorities . 

ance, student financial 'aid 
$9704 for one position , 
University Events-$1500 to 
meet copyright laws and the 
Rape Prevention Task Force-
$1952 for student part-time help 
and office supplies . 

Disabled Students Services 
was to receive an additional 
$19,258 in registration fees , but 
Armitage has indicated that 
" this will be picked up by the 
state," according to Nicoll. 

'~Armitage aid he will be 
concurring with the commit-

, tee's budget recommenda-
tions, " said Nicoll. 

The total increase in the 
permanent budget i "com-
fortably below" the $100,000 
bud get a ry s a v i ngs ta rget 
planned for by last year's 
committee, said Nicoll. 

" There were other programs 
which the committee thought to 
be very important, but for 
which funding was not 
approved because we couldn't 

Disturb Quiet? 

afford it this year," remarked 
Nicoll. 

Organizations not receiving 
. funding were listed in order of 

priority for " possible future 
consideration," he said. 

Among these "borderline 

I\enzie Nicoll 

units " were the Deans' office 
and the Office of Graduate 
Studies Research (OGSR) . 

The committee voted last 
year to fund the Deans' office 
on a permanent basis .but the 
allocation was changed to 
temporary this fall , and 
recent:ly, the committee 
decided that the support didn't 
satisfy the "essential" criteria. 

OGSR's request for a Career 
Placement Officer was 
acknowledged as being needed 
for graduate students, Nicoll 
aid , but a con ensus that this 
hould be funded out of the 

Career Planning and Place-
ment budget was reached. 

During the initial budget 
review deliberations , the 
committee approved $200,000 in 
budget addition , However , 
this was $100,000 over the 
budgetary savings target , so 
the committee wa forced to 
prioritize the unit , a id Nicoll. 

Newport rents operate on a 
seasonal basis , Galligani said. 

In order to end school before 
Christmas , classes would have 
to begin in late August. This 
would make it difficult and 
expensive for students to rent in 
seasonal housing markets like 
Newport Beach. 

A similar situation exists for 
UCSD, Tom Hall, assistant to 
the vice chancellor of academic 
affairs here, says, where the 
Del Mar racing season would 
make it hard for students to get 
housing for a late-August 
school opening date . 

The semester system was not 
discu sed at the last system-
wide academic affairs vice 
chancellor meeting April 25, 
and is a " moot point ," Hall 
said, for the system. 

Doolittle says , however, that 
a change to " hake up the 
s y tern and force fresh 
evalua tion of courses" might 
have been a good idea, even to 
the point of witching system 
every ten year or o.

The Amphitheatre Planning 
Committee has received two 
design proposal for an 
amphitheatre north of Central 
Library, but one of them could 
run into objections from library 
officials. 

The first proposal is a lawn 
amphitheatre to be located 
immediately north of Central 
Library, while the other is a 
SOllO-seat concrete amphithe-

remarked Gittlesohn, " Any-
thing that detracts from this is 

bad for both the library and the 
students. " 

Gittelsohn aid if the ite 
close t to CUL is approved, it 
would interfere with the plans 
to expand the library. 

Anton Witte , director of 
capital budget and space 
management, said that a major 
factor under con ideration by 
the committee i that the 
amphitheatre proposed 
farthe t from CUL is more 
expensive than the one 

proposed immediately north of 
the library. 

" How much the library 
addition would be effected is

CaHrornia law now allows pharmacies to fill prescriptions for 
brand name drugs with their generic equivalents. A generic 
drug contains the same active chemical ingredients, strength 
and therapeutic value as brand-name orpatented drugs and are 
usually considerably cheaper. A customer must usua lly ask the 
pharmacist to make such a substitution. In the last CalPIRG 
drug price survey, we found an amount of Achromycin V to cost 
$3.45 while its generic equivalent, Tetracycline, cost only $2 .29.

Letter to the Editor 

Pates Linked to Abortion 
Editor: 

I am surprised that Hugh 
Pates, as a supposedly 
professional counselor, was so 
judgmental in protesting (The 
Guardian, Friday, May 4, page 
2) my letter linking him to the 
promotion of contraception and 
abortion on campus. I had 
assumed from the original 
Guardian articleon UCSD's sex 
counselors that he was 
intimately associated with 
Sharon Keating a nd her 
abortion racket. 

To set the record straight, 
Keating is in charge of the 
"Sexual Planning Unit'" 
(recently relabeled CCED), 
which serves as an abortion 
referral agency . She came to 
this registration fee funded 
position from BCI, a client 
recruiting agency for Cali-
fornia's largest abortion 
profiteer, Edward C. Allred. 
Allred refers to BCI as a "front 
organization" for his opera-
tions and provides it with staff 
and space in his abortion mills . 

It is strange that a 
professional abortion promoter 
like Keating was hired as a 
"contraceptive counselor" for 
UCSD students. Her conflict of 
interest is evident from the fact 
that she has done nothing to 
counter a series of Guardian 
ads for notoriously ineffective 
contraceptives . Significantly , 
her abortion referral list 
includes her former employer 
(BCI) and Allred's profit 
ma king abortion mill. 

Hugh Pales is right in 
as erting that he doe not play 
an active role in this operation. 
He confines him elf to drawing 
" inhibited" students into the 
o-called "Sex Clinic," where 

he spends his time wringing his 
h a nds about prem a ture 
ejaculation and secondary 
impotence and blessing those 

' questing for the perfect 
orgasm. Although he no doubt 
stimulates a great deal of 
businliss for Sharon Keating, he 
keeps his self-proclaimed 
.. amoral" operation one step 
removed. He stresses that it is 
simply a "remedial program" 
which resolves sexual 
problems "by offering sexual 
behavior modifications." 

Of course, it is simply 
psychological double talk to 
pretend that student-funded 
sexual behavior modification is 
amoral. Machines are amoral; 
human beings are not. 
Behavior modifica tion entails 

altering the (conscious or 
subconscious) moral prin-
ciples upon which a person's 
actions are based . The 
counselor' s desired result is 
achieved by projecting moral 
approval or disapproval. 

Pates' habitual use of such 
tactics is evident from his 
accusation that I made a 
" blatantly false statement" in 
connecting him to the cam pus 
abortion racket. He may Cind 
being linked to Kea ting 's 
activ ities distasteful. However. 
it is difficult to see how he can 
ac hieve exual beh avior 
modifications without being 

involved in some way in 
promoting contraception and 
abortion. After all , as he says, 
" if nature is given a chance, it 
will always work." 

If Pates is so concerned with 
erecting himself as the arbiter 
of honesty, he should first be 
honest about his own handi-
work. Not only does his "sex 
therapy" operation augment 
UCSD:S deplorable abortion 
rate , but as a "remedial " rich-
man's ervice unrelated to 
academic goals, it is a totally 
unjustified rip-off of student 
funds.

Commentary_ _ 

Students Blamed For 
Low Quality of Life 

By Andy Schneider 
Muir Dean's Intern 

" UCSD is a place that loves things and uses people," or so 
says one freshman who will transfer to UC Berkeley next year 
who, like countless others, will drop into UCSD for a year, can't 
handle it, and split. 

Our school is in the state of perpetual motion. Everybody just 
got here, just left, or is at least contemplating a transfer. 
Someone who stays at UCSD for a full four years is a real odd 
commodity. We know people are leaving, but why? 

Some blame the quality of ocial life, but I don 't think beer 
kegs and frats will provide the magic solution . Between the 
colleges , the Associated Students and University Events , there 
is plenty of money and support staff to organize social 
activ i ties. 

Our problem with programming is a lack of committed 
people power. Morc oflen than not, s tudents fail to show up for 
program boa rd meetings. Student government offic~s a nd 
committee position go uncontested, or even without 
candidatc '. 

If we don ' t plan it, who will ? After all. a party is what you 
make of it. 

Others set the poor ,'etention rate sQua rely on the shoulders of 
the faculty , which is painted as cold, unconcerned, and buried 
in scientific research . ]n a faculty and staCf of 10,000 persons 
there have to be some lemons, but they couldn't a ll be scrooges. 

If I were a faculty member and the student didn 't show up for 
office hours, I wouldn ' t bother to sit around either. I remember 
one faculty member who commented, "I was really 
disappointed with my CAPE reviews, but not one student came 
to tell me that they didn ' t like the course. If sombody had said 
something sooner, maybe we could have changed things." 

The problem with UCSD isn' t so much the social life or the 
academics, it is our attitude that's wrong. When it comes down 
to it students are willing to take anything that the 
administration and the [acuIty has to dish out. Our response to a 
problem is always to grumble a little and then go back to the 
libra ry to compete even harder ilgainst each other. 

Change is always difficult when only a few can be found who 
are willing to stand up and voic.-e their concerns. We Wlk ilbout 
the faculty who a re unwilling to le.we their research to 
pilrticipatc with students . What about students who are 
unwilling to leave the library to participate? 

It is so easy to' riticize from .. I distilncc. It is much harder to 
put somcthing of yoursclf into C D. Own your own decision .

It said there were no immediate reports of damage 
or casualties, but that a tidal wave could result and 
threaten small vessels in the area. 

The Richter sca le is a measure of ground motion as 
recorded on seismographs. 

WASHINGTON (AP) - A federal judge yesterday 
dismissed a highly unusual suit in which Sears 
Roebuck & Co. sought to place the blame for allegedly 
discriminatory employment practices on the federal 
government. 

US District Judge June L. Green said that the 
company " has failed to present a ju tifiable case of 
controversy ... . This case must be dismissed." 

The company filed suit in January against 10 
federal agencies , contending that government la ws, 
regulations and pOlicies made it impossible- for the 
compa ny to comply with affirmative action 
requirements. 

Unions Can Check Food 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Employers who provide 

cafeterias and vending machines for their workers 
may have to answer to employee unions about the 
food's prices and quality, the Supreme Court says. 

" It is not suggested that an employee hould work a 
full eight-hour shift without stopping to eat. It 
reasonably follows that the availability of food during 
working hours and the conditions under which it is to 
be consumed are matters of deep concern to 
workers ," wrote Justice ByronR. White.

NEW YORK (AP) - Major league umpires have

" I am making a personal request that we call off the

Department of Energy has to say," Jim Campbell 
told those at a motel meeting room. 

Campbell had earlier spearheaded the drive to 
close stations in protest of federal regulations

Amphitheatre vs. Library 
(Conlinued from page I) 
amphitheatre discussions 
because " the possibilities for 
the library addition are down 
the road a couple years." 

According to committee c0-
chair Diane Annala, the design 
plans for both the lawn and 
concrete amphitheatres are 
"extremely preliminary." 

The estimated cost of the 
proposed lawn amphitheatre is 
$342,000 . This will cover 
drainage, grading, electrical, 
lawn installation and road 
widening (Voight Road) costs. 

However , rental toilets, fencing 
and lighting are not included in 
this estimate. 

Campus Architect Chuck 
Powers noted that additional 
parking may be required if 
performances are expected to 
draw an excess of 2000 people. 

The proposed 5000-seat 
concrete amphitheatre is 
estimated to cost $1.8 million. 
According to Powers. in 
addition to the 1000 parking 
spaces available on Hopkins 
Road, 1000 more spaces would 
be needed to meet the mini mar 

parking requirement for the 
amphitheatre. Thi would 
amount to an additional cost of 
$500.000. 

With the lawn amphitheatre, 
all the facilities at the Sile -
including the stage - will be 
portable, according to Annala. 

Said Annala , "We will be 
relying on oCf-campus people to 
attend the amphitheatre events 
as well; if the area is tota lIy 
grassy and portable, we might 
run the risk of people not 
attending events because they 
don't like the facilities ."

The conference. the first of its 
kind to be held at UCSD , was ·

Richard Friedman (Lit.) , and 
wa entitled "Creation of 
Context. " Taking advantage of 
the presence in California this 
year of visiting Judaic and 
Hebrew scholars. Friedman 
was ab le to bring together 
specialists in different aspect 
of biblical studies. 

Professor Baruch Halpern of 
York University and Professor 
Shemaryahu Talmon of 
Hebrew University , Jerusa-
lem, were among those invited 
to read paper.s to a small 
audience of " informed people ... 
those who had some interest 
in andknowledgeoftheBibleas 
literature, according to 
Friedman. 

"This is a serious profes-

.

Gas Station Owners Are 
ChargingWhat TheyCan 
And Price Restrictions Wi II be Lifted Soon 

By Cindy Beveridge 
Staf( Writer 

Gas station owners in the UCSD area are 
charging at or near the federally imposed 
ceiling on prices for their gasoline, a Guardian 
survey shows. 

While some area stations have reached their 
ceiling, the maximum permissible price by law. 
others have chosen to remain a few cents below 
price limits. 

A station' s ceiling is determined by 
calculating the difference between each 
station's 1973 selling prices and its current 
prices. This figure is then added to the price pa id 
by the retailer as well as the six percent state 
sales tax. 

Most of the sta tion surveyed charge ceiling 
levels for full -service while self-service remains 
one to three cents below the limit. 

Next month, President Carter plans toenact a 
gradua l elimination of the ceilings that have 
kept gas prices from drastica lly escala ting. 

The plan. oullined in his Oval Office address 
earlier this month , will allow the price of U.S. 
Oil to rise from $9.45 per barrel to the world level 
of $14.55. 

The purpose of the program is to promote 
research and development of a lternate sources 
of energy, said Carter. 

None oC the managers of the stations were 
willing to predict how high their prices will jump 
when Carter's plan goes into effect. 

However, Steve Meinhart, manager oC . a 
Chevron station in La Jolla , foresees prices of 

$1.00 a gallon for gas as early as' next month. 
A Chevron manager in Del Mar feels that 

higher prices will only chase his customers 
away. "I'll make no more money at $1.00 a 
gallon than I do now because I'll be paying that 
much more for the gas myself." 

If higher prices in the future provoke the 
already angry and frustrated motorist, some 
consolation may be found in a law signed 
yesterday by Gov. Brown which forces at least 
half of the gasoline stations to stay open on 
weekends. 

Station owners, though. a re unhappy with the 
legislation . Wally Kosinski , manageror a Mobil 
in University City. argues. "We already have so 
damn many regulations we don't know what to 
do. If we don't have the gas , how are we going to 
stay open?" . 

Manager Dan Voughn of a Shell Station in Del 
Mal' was equally pe simistic about the new 
regulation . "We've got along all these years 
without all these rules: I don ' t ee why we can't 
continue working this way ." 

bne of the managers questioned advocated 
the four-day strike proposed by the California 
Service Station Association earlier in the month. 

Supported by almost 2000 dealers , the 
association scheduled a meeting last night to 
decide whether to cancel the strike in return for 
negotiations with federal officials concerning 
higher profits for retailers. 

The shutdown. should it take place, will begin 
tomorrow by dealers who "voluntarily" decide 
to close their stations for the four-day period.

OUO_ PlIolo by Sian Hondo 

Ken Schell (UN Track Club) hits the tape at the finish of the lOO-meter dash in last Satunlay's Intramural track meet. 

Softball: Season Nears End 
As the end of the regular season nears 

its conclusion, here's a quick rundown 
or lome of the many teams you ' ll be 
hearing about in the upcoming playoffs. 

SOFTBALL 
The Men's AAA Division is definitely 

up for grabs this year after a seemingly 
endless string of championships rung 
up by former 1M Director Lee Johnson. 
One of the surprise teams of the season 
Is the RASBERRY QUARKS who have 
parlayed strong hitting and good 
defense into a 5-0 season to date. They 'll 
face pre-season No. of COITUS 
INTRAMURALIS (3-1) next week to 
determine the Slider Leauge champion. 
Men's AAA Top 5: 
1 Profoathletics (5-0) 
2 Rasberry Quarks (5-0) 
3 Long Bailers (4-1) 
4 Codgers (4-0) 
5 Biohazards (4-1) 

In Men's AA, TDH &I CO. and SIT ON 
MY BASE ?re waging a hot battle for 

the lead in the highly competitive 
Spitball League, with the eventual 
winner e merging as the darkhorse 
contender for AA gold . The favorite 's 
role will probably go to either 
CELEBRATION or TEN DEAD BATS 
who are currently running 1-2 in the 
1101ls. And don 't count out those masters 
of self-confidence, the always tough 
ROCKY MOUNTAIN OYSTERS wbo 
are steadily gaining on the pack. RMO 
took a giant step forward last weekend 
with a crucialll-l0, 9th inning upset of 
previously top-rated OOMA GOOMA. 
Men's AA Top 5: 
1 Celebration (5-0) 
2 Ten Dead Bats (5-0) 
3 PB Bombers (4-0) 
4 Rocky Mountain Oysters (4-0) 
5 TDH &I Co. (4-0) 

Men's A Division finds things as 
competitive as ever with only three 
undefeated teams left ... GOOD 
CHOWDA. FERTILE TRIANGLE , and 

the BILLY ALMON FAN CLUB. A key 
match-up in the weeks to come features 
top-rated GOOD CHOWDA against the 
SANDBAGGERS whose 3-2 record is 
marred only by a pair of 9-8 losses. 
Men 's A Top 5: 
1 Good Chowda (5-0) 
2 Fertile Triangle (5-0) 
3 Bonner' Bozos (4-1 ) 
4 Lwgulators (3-1) 
5 Billy Almon Fan Club (3-0) 

Women 's League play heads into the 
final week with 4 or the 6 teams still 
playing .500 or better softball . NO 
BALLS AT ALL with ringers at every 
position seem to be the class of the 
division but they stumbled a bit a week 
back against the NASTY NINE in a 4-3 
thriller that went down to the wire. 
Janae Askew and Carol Petrie lead the 
NINERS both in the field and at the 
plate and could prove troublesome if the 
teams square-off for a rematch in the 
double-elimination tournament that 
starts next week. 
Women's Top 4: 
1 No Balls at All (4-0) 
2 Nasty Nine (3-1) 
3 Bats Out of Hell (3-1) 
4 Biohazards (2-2) 

The Coed AA play-offs promise to be a 
real barn-burner, with class teams 
popping up all over the place. Defending 
champion DR. SHAWN'S OR is super-
tough again despite losing a number of 
their female stars from years past. 
FOBO has been pounding teams into 
submission all season with an average 
of 23 runs a ga me. ITCHY PALMS a nd 
THE WIZ a re a couple of unsung teams

personnel to play with any of the top 
team s, if they can just get everybody to 
show up at the sa me time.

1 Dr. Shawn's OR (5-0) 
2 FOBO (5-0) 
3 Itchy Palms (5-0) 
4 The Wiz (5-0) 
5 Ronnie's Revenge (4-1)

1M 
Track 

When John Greene walked onto the 
UCSD track last Saturday, everyone in 
the place figured he was there to 
compete. It didn ' t seem too surprising. 
After a ll , college intramural track and 
field meets rare ly draw spectators, if 
any at all . And UCS D's first annua l 
version was no exception. A rough 
estim ate o( the crowd in attendance put 
the number a t 42 athletes , 10 meet 
officials, zero spectators, and John 
Greene. 

But make no mistake about it, J ohn 
Greene was there for a purpose. He was 
a n honest-to-goodness coach, a one-of-a-
kind to be su re .. . there to di rect his 
charges to the Learn championship. It 
didn ' t matter that theI ntra mura l Office 
had neglected to even offer anything 
resembling a Learn championship 
event. John Greene' mind was madet:p. 
His team, the Wallbanger Track Cl ub , 
was determined to win the team tit le, 
even though it didn ' t exist. Darn, if they 
didn 't do it , too. Directing his small but 
competitive band of spikers from the 
cozy confines of the team beer cooler . 
Greene orc hestrated a comm a nd 
performance. By mid-a fternoon , five 
othe r teams ha d loosely formed and 
whether Lhey knew it or not, had ente red 
in the chase for the team gold. Greene 
was ready for them. He proml>t1y threw 
a bunch of guys on the track that must 
be employees of Avis Rent-A-Car in 
their s pare time. 

Bob Morgan started things off with a 
second place finish in the ) 10-meter 
hurdles. Grant Glausser took another 
second in the shot put wi th a respecta ble 
throw of 44-5 , and then Morgan came 
back with still another second in the 
long jump at 20-6 3/4. After Mr. 
Wallbanger himself , Wally Warren , 
wiggled his way over 6-4 in the high 
jump to establish 8 new school 1M 
record, the Wallbanger 4Oo-meter relay 
team (of Don Tellez, Stan Benedict, 
Rick Vettl, and Morgan) lined up for 
the final and deciding event. You 
guessed it. They finished second. But 
that was all it took . The three points 
earned in the relay clinched the team 
title for Wallbanger TC with an overall 
total of 17 points. It·was three more than 
the total of 14 earned by the IPAPS 
Track Club that featured distance 
running gurus Larry Woolf and Chris 
Hamaker. It was as simple as that. John 
Greene had his championship and 
easily walked off with coach of the meet 
honors. 

The team championship race wasn' t 
the whole story though. A number of 
outstanding performances were turned 
in on the hottest day of the year. Ken 
Schell got hung up in the blocks, ran into 
a tiff headwind and still breezed to a 10-
yard victory in the 100-mete rdash in the 
excellent lime of ) 1.28. Schell a lso 
anchored his winning U.N . Track Club 
team in the 4Oo-meter relay in a time of 
49 .9. Elsewhere, Gene Robinson won the 
toughest double of the day in the mile 
and two-mile runs turning in credita ble 
efforts of 4 : 50 .9 a nd 10: 42 . 0 
respectively. Larry Woolf took the 800 
and finis hed second to Robinson in both 
distance events to complete a 3 lh-mile 
day of work for IPAPS TC. 

UCSD's version of Ralph Nader, Don 
Strebel, took his act to the track next 
and came away with an easy first in the 
200 meters (24.19) and a second in the 
400. Strebel's one-man Don Strebel 
Track Club finished 4th in the team 
standi OIlS with eight points. 

The women's competition was not 
withou tit 's ow n standout. Sarah French 
was the meet's only triple winner with 
first places in both sprints and the long 
jump. Other emn's event winners 
included: Tom McAulirfe in the 400 
(57.28) and Donovan Lee in the 110-
meter hurdles in 16.46.

Geer, who had been out for 

three weeks because of an

selected by Ganey and his 
assistant to compete in the AII-

center and right fullback. She 
also spends about half of the 
game tending goal since the

"amazing control, " and one of

on the team.

Bergstrom, from Portland, 
Oregon. was the fourth player 
to be named all-league, and the 
only forward from UCSD to 
make the team. 

Bergstrom had been relied 
upon during the regualr season 
to do much of the scoring, but 
the All-Star game meant an 
adjustment toward a more 
pass-oriented style of play . She 
felt that she "ga ined a 
tremendous amount thinking-
wise" from playing with the 
other all-leaguers. 

Nancy StUll. the final Siren to 
achieve all-star status, has 
"done very well as a goalie," 
according to Rothmuller. He 
cited one game in particular 
during)inals week last term in 
which only seven UCSD players 
were on hand to fend off 
Hansen's, one of the tougher ' 
teams in the league. 

Stull "had a brilliant game. 
She was ju t terrific in the 
goal," said Rothmuller. The 
Siren lost the game, but by a 
respectable score of 2-0.

best characterizes the type of 
season the Siren have had. The 
girls who did show up played 
enthusia lically , only to be 
overmatched and outnumbered 
in the -end. The season has been 
generally satisfying no doubt 
(the five UCSD women chosen 
to play in all-star competition 
was more than a ny other team 
in the league) , but there has 
been an overriding problem, 
not uncommon to many of 
UCSD ' s sports teams -
intercollegiate or not - lack of 
support. 

The is ue centers around the 
fact that there is simply not 
enough interest on campus to 
form a strong women's soccer

CALLING ALL 
FORMER 
OASIS 
TUTORS: 

M onday UCSD was bimbo·d. Strange {olks in even stranger co -
tumes (no, not the Hare 
Krishnas, the other ones) 
invaded the Revelle Mall 
during lunch while the band 
Matrix played , the Hare 
Krishnas looked for an 
audience and upporters o{ an 
" imagin atio n play day ," 
dressed in clown makeup and 
bright clothes, handed out 
announcements. 

The costumed characters 
were actors {rom a multi-
media presentation, bimbo, 
(spelled that way) to be 
performed Thursday in 
Mandeville Center at 8 pm. The 
repertory company presenting 
the production also is known as 
the bimbos, and has been 
together for a little more than a 
yea r. 

La t Saturday night ' s 
performance of bimbo , at 
Encinitas ' La Paloma Theater, 
was a high spirited, belly-
laughi ng good ti me. It captured 
the 70s ' search for enlighten-
ment in much the same way 
that Hair! did the 60s, but 
unlike the latter. bimbo also 
poked a good bit of {un at its 
times. 

Thi reviewer found ome of 
the integrat ion of film and live 
performance somewhat awk-
ward, and sound tracks on 
cinemagraphic Cli p - which 
were filmed here by David 
Ronce <l nd Michele Kinyon -
were muddy , but the live 
portion of the musical a llegory 
were exub rant and at times 
<lpproached superb.

Writer/ director/ producer/ 
actor J ack Barnard captured 
some of the funnier side of new 
age religions well in the second 
act. in which Monty Hall-type 
game show producer Johnny 
King (Barnard) sponsors " The 
Masters Show," the Ted Mack 
Amateur Hour of religious 
leaders. 

Contenders in the finals are 
Swa mi Purapanda, a guru to 
the sta rs who offers disco as the 
answer (Timothy Ostremm); 
Juju , a Carribean voodoo 
priestes who leads her 
followers away {rom "Junkie-
hood" to faith (Kevyn Lettau) ; 
and Brother Bob, who can cure 
anything for enough money 
(Barnard again) . 

Instrumental accompani-
ment for the show's 18 songs is 
provided by Peter Sprague and 
the Dance of the Universe 
Orchestra - and sung by cast 
members, including Dance of 
the Universe lead singer Lettau 
- whose incredible range and 
control as a singer and as a 
dancer could make or break 
any show. 

Other bimbos of particular 
note are 13-year-old Lisa 
Paschall , a Mariel Hemingway 
look-a like who adds her shine to 
four small roles , Annella 
Rechin and Ba rba ra Bills, 
whose respective pel'for-
man ces include a joint 
appearance a~ Siamese twins. 

Watching bimbo is a litlle like 
sitting on the Revelle Mall at 
lunchtime. watching all the 
performers a nd their au-
diences : there's something {or

'Can Judge a Book' Ad 
T hat formally-s ituated chair you have been dodging, placed in the 
middle of the entrance to the 
Undergraduate Humanities 
Library, is not there merely to 
draw your attention to Eleanor 
Antins Artist's Books Class 
show, You Can Judge aBookby 
Its Cover. It is an original work 
of art in itself, executed by 
Jeanette Kingery, who titled it 
Kin, Edward, referring to the 
three drawer-like cigar boxes 
of that brand, encased beneath 
the chair and (hopefully?) to 
the Edwardian style of the 
furniture . Exploration of the 
boxes' interiors reveals 
comfortably organic contents 
such as a small bird's nest and a 
lock of hair, whose humble 
qualities relate back to the 
muslin upholstery material and 
mat of articulately woven 

appropriate location for an 
exhibit of artist's books than a

in the card file that images its

is Randall S. Cornish ' s black-

ingenious construction lacks 
subtlety, which is a common 
shortcoming shared by many

Similarly, the timely message 
of Jenine Marguerite Hesse's 
"I'm Clean", a large brass-

reveal a woman's nude torso, 
carved in soap, is clear, Her

Blood, Swelt Ind Tears 

B ack in 1968 Bob Dylan sideman and ex-Blues Project Member Al 
Kooper gathered together 
vario us ro c k an d jazz 
musicians to form a band that 
would crossbreed those two 
musical tyles into omething 
new and distinctive. Over a 
decade later. Blood, Sweat and 
Tear continues to record and 
perform, though its personnel 
have entirely changed and its 
so und i anyt hing but 
revolutionary . Indeed , the 
original BS&T and the current 
band have little in common but 
the name, as I discovered last 
Friday night at their ata-
maran Hotel concert. 

Blood , Sweat and Tears rose 
to fame after the d par·ture of 
lead s inger Kooper and his 
replacement by the husky-
voiced David Clayton-Thomas. 
With layton-Thomas as 
[rontman t.he band had aeries 
of stylish , we ll-cra fted hit , 
appealing blends of AM pop and 
upper-club jazz. It was the 

recollection of these songs that 
prodded me into seeing BS&T 
last week - what I a tually 

heard at their show was 
something else again. 

On record back in the early 
70s Clayton-Thomas ' voice 
combined gruffness with a 
certain theatrical polish. He 
never seemed a great jazz 
singer by any means, but his 
singing had a certain dignity 
and strength of timbre. Seeing 
him perform years after his 
last hit was a letdown to say the 
least. Coaxing the audience to 
sing along, cracking tillborn 
jokes and offering inane sexist 
patter ("I wanna make love toa 
woman who's deaf, dumb and 
blind ... " ) , Clayton-Thomas 
was a thoroughly unappealing 
a stage personality as I can 
imagine. Genuine warmth and 
friendliness on a inger 's part 
isn ' t essenlialto a good concert 
- I've een artists like Lou 
Reed ignore audience and still 
deliver fine performances . But 
Clayton-Thoma was p a-
tronizing to his fans. absolutely 
unconvincing in his po e a an 
impassioned oul singer. He 
gave the concert a stodgy, Las 
Vegas loung atmo phere ,

Naqel Brings Berkeley Dance to SD 

Associated Studenfs 

'Ms. Poker Face' Puts Impressive 
Credits Into Experimental Show 

L ast Friday night at I Three's Company Dance Studio, 860 Third Ave., 
San Diego theatre and dance 
audiences were introduced to 
Bay Area artist Irini Nadel. 
Her background includes a 
balance of classical and 
modern technical training 
(London Arts Education School 
and Julliard School in New 
York) combined with West 
Coast improvisation and 
theatre inspirations. Nadel has 
acquired many impressive 
credits during twenty years in 
dance (teaching, choreo-
graphing, and performing) . 
including the titles of Artistic 
Director and major chore-
ographer of the five-year-old 
Footloose Dance Company in 
Berkeley . With a primary 
emphasis upon supporting new 
and experimental dance and 
performance art, Footloose 
philosophies spill over into 
Nadel's own solo work, 
"Strings too Short to Save" and 
"Rose Pie Ice," which she 
performed Friday night. 

I had met Nadel briefly the 
night prior to the concert, 
finding her slightly withdrawn 
and distant, if not true to 
another reviewer's depicting of 
her as "Ms. Poker Face." I was 
consequently bappily shocked 
by her subtly dynamic 

introduction to an embarras-
s ingly small audience. 
Walking and running around 
the performing space (in place 
of a formally-raised stage, two 
white pillars designate the 
separation between audience 
and performer), Irini looked 
directly into the eyes of the 
" crowd. " 

Her infamous poker face 
proceeded to take on a new 
significance. After a few 
moments , Nadel interrupted 
the rustlings of a still-settling 
audience by saying, " So ... here 
we are ... here I am ... You came 
here with certin expectations ... 
I have my own, too .. .. " An 
unexpected introduction, to be 
sure. Nonetheless, by acknowl-
edging the a udienc e as 
participant sharing in her 
performance (Le. testing 
traditional barriers between 

.performer and passive 
audiences), Irine Nadel 
comfortably began to guide 
herself and her new San Diego 
acquaintances through a ra re 
evening filled with ingenious 
proddings at our hearts, minds, 
funnybones, souls and critical 
attentions. 

The predictable unpre-
dictability of change and 
moment-to-momentness of 
living, a central theme to the 
solos performed , but more 

explicilly in " Strings Too Sholt 
toSave ." Thesologets its name 
from a 3/5 card which wa 
taped on a box belonging to 

adel's grandmother, labelled 
<.Jccordingly "Strings too short 
to save. " Strings refers to th 
balance between the ability to 
cast about improvisational 
movement in one moment and 
lock into clean , structured 
patterns in the next; "the too 
short trings and the neat box 
that contains them." 

Donning hiking boots while 
explaining th at it was a " break 
in the action ," Nadel began 
"Strings ." She created such an 
at-ea e atmosphere that I felt 
as if we were sitting in an 
intimate corner of a Berkeley 
coffee house. 

Nadel began an increasingly 
complicat_ed series of teps and 
c1onks , pirouettes , direction 
changes a nd sudden stops in 
her waffle-stompers (definitely 
Bay Area chic) , switching from 
formalized patterns . then 
enatically shattering expec-
tations ag<:li n with scrambled, 
spontaneous movements. She 
al 0 accompanied this dance 
with bits a nd pieces of 
everyday dialogue, singing, 
facia l and physical gestures 
(including a moment of sign 
langu age while hanging 
sideways with one leg extended 
to the ceili ng) . 

About midway through, 
Nadel excbanged her hiking 
boots for a pair of blue 
sneakers, proceeding to flop 
around spasmodically (a la 
Twyl a Tharp) . Yet she

The two groups were

it all came together at the same 
time."

OR will fu ncli on inde -
pendently of the Space 
Institute. The ORU will serve 
ba ically to bring together 
astrophysics researchers from 
evera l depal'tments on 

campus. 

"Astronomer here are all 
scattered about . " sa id 
Burbidge, adding, "We don' t 
have a department of our own. " 

She noted that there are 
astro nomer s a nd astro-
physicists in the physics 
department a nd the de-
p a rtment of electrical 
engineering and com puter 
science (for merly APIS) . 
There is also a cosmochemistry 
group within the department of 

• 

chemistry. 
Gray explai ned that by 

definition a n ORU crosses 
d epartme ntal lines. Con-
cerning the number of such 
research units on cam pu , he 
added that, "We ort of run 
neck-a nd-neck with Berkeley 
and CLA ." 

" It ' only when an inter-
disciplinary group with related 
interests gets large enough that 
the need crie out for something 
like this , " s a id Thoma 
Robinson. Resear"h Manage-
ment admini trative analyst. 

Seve l-al reasons for the 
formation of th research unit 
were cited in th proposal. One 
major justification' was the 
participation of UCSD 
researchers in many related 
state and nation-wide space 
science activities, uch as the 
designi ng of instruments for 
the space telescope. 

Also mentioned was the 
possibility of coll aboration 
between researchers in several 
divisions of astronomy: optical 
and high-energy astronomy, 
solar physics and theoretical 
astrop hysic s , gamma -ray 
astronomy and cosmochemis-
try. 

Robinson explained that the 
ORU is "solely an adminis-
trative thing, but it relates very 
closely to the grant-application 
process." 

The ORU budget proposal 
first must be approved by the 

"Bottled 
Babies" a film and explanatory presentation 

For more informalion, call CalPIRG at 452-4873. ---- ----- ------

Regents and then ent on to the 
California state legislature. If 
approved a t that level. it will 
awai t the sig nature of 
Governor Brown. 

" 1 assume by June I we will 
know whether the budget will 
be approved by the legis la-
ture .· ' said Robinson . He 
expects that the Governor's 
decision will be received arly 
in July. 

A cording to Robinson . the 
funding " is money above and 
beyond the regular budget of 
the university ." For thi 
reason. if approved the OR 
will not cau e cutbacks in other 
areas. 

Radioactive Scanner 

According to Burbidge, the 
ORU may require the 
relocation of "some people, but 
not a ll " involved with 
a trophysics in order to 
facilitate communication. 

Gray believes that existing 
office and laboratory space 
may not be ufficient to house 
the new ORU <Jnd the Space 
Institute. "Tentative plans ar 
that they will need additional 
space," aid Gr<JY . 

He added, however, that no 
new buildings are yet planned 
b causcofrec ntlimitationson 
available government funding. 

Early Coronary Artery 
Disease May Be Detected 
An experimental radioactive 

scanning technique developed 
at the University of California 
at Los Angeles may help detect 
mild coronary artery disea e 
before it causes a heart attack. 

By tracing the biochemistry 
of the body, the technique can 
potenti a lly identify heart 
disease in the early stages 
when it can be treated more 
effectively, perhaps even 
reversed , according to 
developers of the method . 

They a re Drs. Michael 
Phelps, Heinrich Schelbert and 
Edward Hoffman , in the 
divi ion of nuclear medicine at 
the UCLA School of Medicine. 

The investigators reported 
their initial results at the World 
Federation of Nuclear

where they received the Von

Yet, through her unique and 
honest mode of expression (a

of Rachmaninoff, Scriabin and

audience as well as the artist. 
By exploring lier own passages 
through conflict, change, and 
consequent growth, her San

reflect upon similar ex -

provokes people to remark : " I

Considering that only 
Clayton-Thomas remains from 
the group of performers that 
recorded the old Blood, Sweat

standable that these tunes 
would be de-emphasized by the 
new band line-up in their 
concert. Yet there's no excuse 
flJr reducing fine material like 
"God Bless the Child" and 
"You've Made Me So Very 
Happy" to fragments in a 
glibly-sung medley, as Clay ton-
Thomas and- the group did that 
night. It was especially 
annoying to hear Laura Nyro's 
magnificent "And When I Die" 
chopped up callously and 
randomly mixed in with other 
musical pieces. I WANTED to 
hear that goddamn song in its 
entirety, but all Clay ton-
Thomas would give me was 
tepid new material, mediocre 
ballads like "You're the One."

Outstanding among them were 
the Piltch brothers, guitarist 
Rob and bassist David, who 
brought a little vitality to a 
concert that had a crying need 
for it. The younger sibling on 
bass was particularly pleasing, 
laying down supple, rhythmic 
lines, playing off nicely against
