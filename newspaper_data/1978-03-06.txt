Slate bill would ban 
student housing bia~ 

by Reed ~.pert 
Alfsociate News Editor 

A state Assembly bill that 
would prohibit housing discri-
mination against students is 
being voted upon today in the 
Senate Finance Committee. 

The bill (AB 1032) would 
amend the Rumford Fair 
Housing Act that currently 
makes it illegal to discriminate 
in housing beca use of a person 's 
race , color , religion , sex, 
marital status, national origin 
or ancestry . The Assembly 
Committee on Housing and 
Community Development has 
already passed the bill and, if 
passed by the Finanace 
Committee, it would go to the 
floor of the Senate. 

" The bill will prevent , 
Jegally, landlords or realtors 
from stopping students from 
renting because they ' re ' 
students , " explained Phil 
Issac, UCSD Student Lobby 
Annex Director . Currently , 
anyone who doesn 't want to 
rent to students may legally do 

Monct.y, M.rch 6, 1978 

so, said Issac, pointing out that 
many realtors maintain two 
lists of available places, one 
that students are shown and one 
they aren't. 

According to Jon Haber, UC 
Student Lobby Director, the bill 
came before the l3-member 
Finance Committee two years 
ago and was defeated by three 
votes. 

" We have a pretty reason-
able chance of getting it passed 
this time," said Haber. "It's 
blatant discrimination and we 
have put a tremendous amount 
of ener~y into it, more than any 
other bill this year." 

Senator John Stull, who is on 
the Finance Committee and 
whose district includes UCSD, 
has, according to his office on 

Friday, not yet had a chance to 
study the bill . 

If the bill does become law, 
there remains the aspect of 
enforcement. â€¢ 'When you get 
into housing rules and laws 
things become very compli-
cated, " said Issac. " Butthe law 
would be putting housing 
discrimination against stu-
dents under the purview of the 
law . It ' s the main step in 
solving the problem. In some 
cases you might be able to get 
legal recourse." If a realtor 
was found to be discriminating 
against students his license 
could be revoked. 

Opponents of the measure 
argue that landlords should be 
able to decide to whom they

The origin and future of man, 
which remains uncertain, were 
the topics of a symposium 
sponsored by the L.S.B. Leakey 
Foundation entitled "Roots of 
Humanity" held Saturday in 
San Diego at which five 
internationally eminent 
authorities gathered to speak 
on their fields of speciality. 

Anthropologists Shirley 
Strum of UCSD, Mary Leakey, 
wife of the late Louis Leakey, 
and Bernard Campbell of 
UCLA, psychiatrist David 
Hamburg formerly of Stanford 
University and professor of 
astronomy and space sciences 
at Cornell University. Carl 
Sagan addressed the group at 
the San Diego Town and 
Country Conference Center 
during the 9 am to 5 pm event. 

At a Friday press conference, 
(our of the specialists (Ham-
burg was still en route to San 
Diego) cautiously responded to 
questions on homonid origins 
and the possible biological and 
environmental future for 
mankind. 

Pbysical allera&ion 
Sagan commented, "No one 

is in a position to predict a 
chance in the species, because 
we've reacbed a stage where 
we are in full cootrol oYer eor 
destiny." He laid that the 
environment is cbanging at 
such a rapid pace that a natural 
adaptation by the species will 
inevitably have to be lupple-
mented by human alteration of 
the human body, already 
visible in the phenomena of 
artificial limbs and other 
anatomical parts. 

Leakey would not commit 
herself to speculations about 
the future of the species, and 
when asked if we should expect 
a proloDied adolescence during 
human development, she, 
appearinl amused, IBid. "You 
Caft If you want to." 

LaMey, however, spoke of 
her recent fladinc. at a site In 

the Olduvai Gorge in Northern 
Tanzania, which push back the 
date of established human 

-ancestry nearly one million 
years to 3.5 or3.75 million years 
ago. The uncovering includes 
the jawbones and teeth of eight 
adults and three children, plus 
six footprints of a knuckle-
walking primate, which she 
says is larger than any fossil 
primate found before, and five 
prints which "seem to have 
been made by homonids." She 
said that there are no traces of 
stone or bone that may have 
been used by the homonid, and 
she felt that "we're dealing 
with a pre-tool making period." 

""hese creatures died at an 
early age," stated Leakey. 
"More than 50 percent of those 
we found were under seven 
years old." 

Baboon studies 
Strum spoke of her studies of 

a baboon colony in Kenya 
where she is the director of the 
Gilgil Baboon Project, saying 
that the future of primates in I . 

Africa is .. a complicated 
issue." She said that there are 
economic and political factors 
involved in the problem and 
that she is upset with the 
Westerners who go to Kenya 
trying to put an end to the

fund the center is currently 
being considered. Leifer said 
that the request will be acted on 
by early April. 

Approximately $6000 of the 
request would be used to salary 
a staff consisting of a director, 
resource developer and a 
projects coordinator for the 
center. The remaining $4000 
would be given out in grants. 

According to Leifer a similar 
program at UC Davis was given 
university funding its first year 
but continued by receiving 
federal grants. Leifer said he 
hopes the same things will 
happen at UCSD. 

Gray: Muir means communication 

The AS currently has $1000 
hudgeted for a grant program. 
This money will be used to 
begin an AS Mini -Grant 
Program to supplement the 
center. if the budget request is 
gran.ted. 

If the center is not funded the 
$1000 would be used to purchase 
a small research grants Ubrary 
that would aid students seeking 
grants, though this, said Leifer, 
" Would hardly be adequate. "

"I came here before there 
was a John Muir College," 
said Activities Coordinator 
Bobbie Gray. "It's hard to 
believe that from the first two 
or three hundred students who 
were on a first name balis, we 
have grown to 2,100." 

Gray holds primary respon-
sibility for social and recrea-
tional Pl'Olrams on the Muir 
campus. She believes that the 
major purpose of the Activi-
tiel Office is to bridle the gap 
between attitudes and reach 
out to as many different 
student ,roups as pouible. 

Stressing communication, 
she commented that "no 
Itudent should ever have to 
feel lost in a big system. I 
prefer to do the tbinas that 
make people bappy wltb life. 

There should be other ways to 
get involved besides classes ... 

Gray provides direct 
support and helps to coordi-
nate resources for the Muir 
Program Board, the Five and 
Dime Committees, Cloud's 
Rest Commuters and House 
Advisors. 

Stability and plalllliq has 
become the key to effective 
projects organized throUlh 
this office, pointed out AS 
Muir Representative Gary 
Moser . "Before it was 
created, student projects 
were always hit and miss. 
This way everyone gets 
involved with out overlap. We 
rely on Bobbie's expertiae to 
put the pieces together." 

He continued to explain that 
student membership on 
committees sometimes 
chan,e. from quarter to 

quarter and there is a need for 
someone who has " learned 
from consistent experience. " 

Supporting Moser , Muir 
senior Jeff Rice said, "Stu-
dents would never get 
anywhere if each time we had 
to start a project from 
scratch. We would have never 
pulled off Cloud ' s Rest if 
Bobbie ,hadn't been there to 
see us through ." Rice was 
referring to the newly opened 
commuter lounse estabUshed 
by students at Muir. 

The concept of pooling 
efforts by students, with one 
staff member who coordi-
nates the efforts , is sUU 
relatively new, said Muir 
Dean Jim Beckley. Less than 
three years ago the Muir 
Resident Dean and Assistant 
Dean were changed to 

(Pleue 'urn &0 pap J) 

Though, according to Reg 
Fee Co-chair Marsha Harris, 
the proposal has " a fairly good 
chance " of receiving its 
requests nearly intact. 

The request for the center 
was put together by Leifer 
Harris and KSDT News 
Director Bob Rubinyi. 

Commenting on the proposal, 
Leifer said, "The student who 
ba an nri ' I . fAl'PS many 
difficulties. The Grant Center 
would provide a place for the e 
students to ~o .. involving 
tudent. in the e~ucation 

process can only help the

Commentary 
From 'Roots' to 'King': 
black shows static 

by BiUMudel 
Pacific News Service 

The broadcast on Feb. 12, 13 and 14 of NBC's six-hour "King", a 
TV biography of the civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr:, 
came almost exactly a year after ABC's triumphant presentation 
of "Roots", based on the best-selling book by Alex Haley . 

The year between "Roots" and "King" was supposed to be a 
year of great progress ror black actors, actresses and writers of 
intelligent black-oriented stories. A glance at the facts, however, 
shows that the black TV renaissance still hasn't happened. 

BiU Mandel is &be broadcast columnis& for &lie San Francisco 
Examiner. 

Perhaps the most glaring example of the TV public's disinclina-
tion to accept serious black topics was the ratings failure of NBC's 
"King," after the network spent almost $4 million to produce it. 
The mini-series' premiere episode Sunday, February 12, was 
rated last on that night and last for the entire TV week ending on 
the 12th. The final two installments on February 13 and 14 were 
also rated in last place for their respective nights. 

Aside from considerations of competing shows on other 
networks, the TV community generally acknowledged that 
" King'''s failure was unexpected. Its rejection by the viewing 
public has been attributed to reasons ranging from racism to 
public revulsion for the national divisions of the 1960s. Whatever 
the cause, it's clear from empirical observation that something-
the production comm-unity, the networks and/or the public - is 
stopping reasonable, realistic black projects from succeeding on 
TV. 

The "Roots" phenomenon was unique. The soap-opera 
bastardization of Haley's gripping book removed color from all 
characters, black and white, and coated the whole story in the 
distorting gilt of a typical Hollywood TV tale. The series was a 
costume drama , buffered by 200 years of intervening history, and 
so didn't strike viewers as a black-white story of today. 

When " Roots" set new ratings records in January, 1977, and 
became a national obsession for one week, Hollywood seers 
predicted a flood of new work for black entertainment 
craftspeople. AÂ·year later, the only beneficiaries of the "Roots" 
success are LeVar Burton, Leslie Uggams, Louis Gossett, Jr. and 
Ben Vereen . Sadly, many of these talented people now spend their 
professional lives constantly re-living the "Roots" saga. Ben 
Vereen's recent ABC entertainment special was subtitled, "His 
Roots", and LeVar Burton reports he's more or less become the 
young Kunte Kinte. 

" Black" TV programs that are successful are, almost without 
exception, horribly distorted stereotypes produced and written by 
white men and women . 

CBS' " Good Times", the home of Jimmy " J .J ." Walker (Mr. 
Dy-No-Mite) , suffered the loss of its female lead last fall when 
Esther Rolle quit the show, charging the producers (Norman 
Lear's Tandem Productions) were insulting black Americans by 
playing up a character who is 18-years-old, doesn't work or go to 
school and seems to survive on street hustling. Black leaders had . 
earlier complained about "Good Times" when the father 
character (John Amos) was written outofthe show, thus leaving a 
mother-headed household . Are all blacks living in fractured 
families, the leaders asked? Must all black women be depicted as 
maids? 

The most successful "black" show now on TV is ABC's "What's 
Happening! ", which is basically a white version of what life is [ike 
in a funky, funny ghetto. In this series the main character is a 
hippo-like teenager nicknamed Rerun, a living Dennis the Menace 
Jone to fat . The adultcbaracters in "What's Happening! " strive to 
Impose order and civilization on the bumptious youngsters, but the 
jungle drums or gbetto rock music and the call of the streets 
alway triumph. In "What's Happening! " the bad guys always win. 

The newest " black" show to hit the air is CBS' "Baby I'm Back", 
and if its writers ever heard about the black renaissance post-
"Roots" it doesn't show up in the series. 

"Baby I'm Back" is about a charming; hustling wastrel (played 
by Demond Wilson of the late NBC hit "Stanford" Son", another 
racist stereotype) who returns to his wife and two children seven 
years after deserting them to play the horses. His wife has become 
engaged to another man in the interim and has had the Wilson 
character declared legally dead. 

Obviously, the writers and producers think desertion or family is 
an excellent fulcrum on which to balance a "black" show. The 
firm resolve of the wife to retain her independence from the 
roughish hustler is eroding weakly on the series, which is 
climbing in the ratings after its introduction early this year. 

On all " black" shows one of the most Important humor sources 
- to judge from the hysteria of the recorded laugh track -Is the 
dialect joke. Just let one character utter "de ribber" or exclaim 
"Oh, yeah!" in minstrel-show exaggeration and the canned 
laughter erupts In torrents. 

It was only a year from the triumph of "Roots" to the 
disheartening failure of "King." The year .intervening was 
supposed to see a maturing of TV's attitudes toward black topics 
and artists. Instead, the TV audience has been given "Roots" 
retreads and two new racist situation comedies. Those waiting for 
the revolution are stili waiting.

On Tuesday, residents of Del

members and express their 
opinions on lour proposed 
methods for providing moder-
ate-cost housing in the com-
munity. 

Because Del Ma r elections are 
usually close (the last council 
election was decided by four 
votes) and students make up 20 
per cent of the registered voters 
in the city, students will playa

Muir Writing 
EdJtor: 

Correspondent John Dorrance 
is, alaB, only too correct in his 
charge of abBurdity, but levels it 
at the wrong target. 

It would be lovely if we simply 
. counted the students who want 
to take Muir 20 each quarter and 
provided sections and TAs to fit. 
But its not like that. TAs have to 
be found, found and trained a 
year in advance and for a year-
long commitment. Each winter 
we must project how many 
students we expect the following 
year. and we are lunded 
accordin, to these projections, 
present enrollments, and the 
largesse of the administration. 

The reason we have only 300 
spaces for 400 students is that 300 
were projected to take Muir 20 
this spring. The other 100 opted 
to take it last spring, faB and 
winter but didn 't show up . 
Earlier letters, advertisements, 
cajoleries and warnings failed to 
bring them in, even though Muir 
20 is 8 graduation requirement 
students are expected to 
complete by the end of their 
sophomore year. 

There are, theoretically , 
already not enou,h spaces for 
the 100 procrastinators, and if 
they delay further they'll be 
competing for spaces with next 
year's new admissions plus the 
inevitable procrastinators from 
this year ... 

But don't worry because it's a 
good bet that half of'the 400 we 
addressed won ' t enroll for 
spring anyway. Hell, lhey can'l 
really nail you for lbe requi[e-
ment till you graduate ... and If 
you IJPIOI'e it, it may 10 away ... 

When we try to picture this 
silent, faceless, and growing 
population of students. it is with 
the nasty realization that one 
day not too far away, come 
de(ree check time, they wiu 
suddenly materialize. knockilll 
on our doors and demandilll 
spaces that by then will belon, to 
future freshmen. 

But that's all in the future, 
right? So why worry now? Well 
the immediate result of their 
procruUnation is that tbls 
spring's sections will most likely 
be underenrolled. And If that 
happens our TA allocations for 
next year will almost certainly 
be cut, and that meana fewer 
spaces for next year's freabmen, 
and more students to Join the 
number of those who, whether 
they postponed willin,ly or 
unwUUngly, will be panickin, 
and scrambllDl come gradua-
tion. 

Mr. Dorrance's chargea then, 
should be leveled not at Muir 
WritiDl but at the Muir students 
who are putlinl the WritiDl p~ 
gram in the position of havllll 
too few apaces to serve the 
students held for the require-
ment and paradoxically. not 
enough students to fill the 
exlstin, spaces.

election. That is nothing new. 
The last three city council 
elections have been decided by 
the votes of students . 

Unlike some communities 
where students and town/lpeople 
view each other with suspicion, 
Del Mar has seen the creation of 
a remarkable coalition of 
students. environmentalists and 
other progrel8ive elements in 
the communlty. Together, these 
groups have made Del Mar a 
model for allofCallfomia. They 
have shown that a communlty 
can protect its physical 
environment, maintain a senae 
01 community identity and 
develop creative social and 
cultural programs despite the 
"ressures of outside lan1 
developers and the pervasive 
conservatism of southern 
Califomia. 

John Weare and Nancy 
Hoover were elected to the city 
council lour years ago by this 
coalition . They are running for 
re-election Tuesday and they 
deserve your support . They 
have guided Del Mar through 
four tumultuous years that saw 
the adoption of a new, environ-
mentally sensitive community 
plan and voter approval of an 
open space bond issue that will 
expand our coastal and canyon 
parks. 

A major problem aflecting all 
coastal communities is rapidly 
rising property costs which have 
caused rental rates to sky-
rocket. Many people in Del Mar 
value the social and cultural 
diversity created by the 
presence of students, the elderly 
and young families, all of whom 
are slowly being priced out of the 
community. 

It was for this reason that John 
and Nancy joined a number of 
other concerned citizens in

selective force in the survival of

Strum said that while there 
are difrerent philosophies 
about how one approaches a 
primate field study , " I 
personally feel that by interact-
ing you change the interaction 
that you have come to ob-
serve." She said that those who 
work at her site in Kenya have a 
policy of non-intervention , 
where they don't try to 
communicate and don't return 
gestures. 

The appplication of the policy 
"doesn't mean I don't have 
favorites," said Strum, who 
added that the young baboons, 
who have been born since the 
inception of the project, "have 
no fear of humans at all, and it's 
hard to keep out of their way." 
She also clarified that " wild 
animals are seldom dangerous 
unless frightened orcomered." 

Pilot project 
Edwin Munger, professor of 

politica 1 geography at the 
California Institute of Techno-
logy (CIT) and president of the 
Leakey Foundation, told the 
Triton Times the foundation-
sponsored symposia were not 
the only project of the 90 
percent volunteer group, and 
that today marks the beginning 
of a pilot project of paleo-
anthropology in a group of 20 
selected Los Angeles area high 
schools . Depending on the 
success of the project, he said, 
there were hopes that it would 
be implemented throughout the 
state and then the nation.

can go; there is no limit to what you can do. because there IS no limIt to the 
power of your mind . Students report SImple things like learning to stop 
smoking. to fall asleep without drugs and wake up without clocks. to relieve 
nervou ne s. to stop excessive drinking, to memorize long lists and to imprm 'e 
creat. vi ty - to the more sophisticated things like learning to develop ESP and 
to use dreams to solve problems and to get info rmation. 

Over 1.000.000 people all over the world have taken Silva Mind Contro l. and

Dear K. Wally: In light of the 
controversy over the renaming 
of Fourth College, I re -
commend that, when and if a 
fifth college Is established at 
UCSD, it be named "John and 

Jane Doe College." The past 
historie~ of Jane and John Doe, 
being unknown , cannot be 
objectionable. The name

Dear CNN revisited : We 
prefer OWIL College , Owil 
being a n acronym for One Who 
Is Loved. Note that this 
acroynm makes an excellent 
replacement for the sexist 
pronouns (he, she, his, hers), 
extant in the English language . 
We encourage its use because it 
is far less sterile than many of 
the current attem pts at not 
uttering the sexist elements of 
the langua ge we love, honor 
a nd obey. 

Our space is s hrinking but we 
still urg e you to send us

Harth. who will be heard on 
March 18 and 19 in the

commodity - a total musician. 
Since his appointment as

appreciated by critics and 
audiences as one of the city's 
most versatile performers. In 

the New Yorker. eminent critic 
Winthrop Sargent wrote : 
" Harth is in danger of becom-
ing my favorite performer in 
his field. If finer violin playing 
is being done nowadays 
anywhere, I have not heard it. 
Mr. Harth is more than a 
viOlinist; he is an artist." 

Harth has also found time in 
his busy scheduJe to make 
numerous recordings. They are 
available on the Iramac . 
London , Vanguard. and 
Musical Heritage Society
