Berkeley 
Protest 

Police moved into Moses Hall . 
at UC Berkeley at 6 a.m. Thurs-
day morning and broke up a 
demonstration which had been 
going on since Wednesday. 

The students were protesting 
the policy of the Board of Re-
gents in respect to Social Ana-
lysis 139X, an experimental 
course taught primarily by El-
dridge Cleaver, Black Pantber 
Party minister ofinformation and 
presidential candidate of the 
Peace and Freedom Party. 

According to eyewitnesses, an 
estimated seven hundred police-
men, representing the forces of 
Berkeley, Burlingame, Oakland 
and other cities moved in quickly 
and cleared the Hall. There 
was no violence, and demonstra-
tor s left peacefully. 

Seventy-six persons were ar-
rested on various charges. Bail 
was posted later in the morning 
at $650.00 apiece, except for 
certain leaders of the protest, 
whose bail was somewhat higher. 

A noon rally was scheduled 
in tront of Sproul Hall today 
to determine what course of ac-
tion the students shouldnowtake. 
Some students had been talking 
about taking over the student 
union, or holding a general strike 
in the classroms. 

However, it was the feeling of 
several students that whatever 
action is decided upon, it wlll 
probably not occur until next 
w ek. PI.. ,," S,.ee'

The Revelle College Govern-
ment approved a resolution sub-
mitted by the Sub-Committee on 
Sound Amplification in the Free 
Speech Plaza this week. 

Sound Amplification will be 
handled by a Free Speech Board 
with two member s appointed by 
the RCG and one by the Inter-
Hall Council. It will be limited 
to the Free Speech Plaza and 
subject to the following regu-
lations: 

Sound equipment will be sup-
plied by RCG for use between 
11:45 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. It must 
be used in the east part of the 
plaza, not directed at the dorms. 
Recorded or broadcast material 
may be used. 

Use of the equipment is li-
mited to r egistered student or-
ganizations of UCSD and private 
me mbers of the Revelle College 
community upon prior approval 
by the College Dean of the Free 
peech Board. 

Outside the Plaza, "the privacy 
of the colle~ .must be upheld.-

The RCG is taking names for 
appointments to the following 
committees: Revelle College 
Judicial Board, Communications 
Board, Social Events Committee, 
and Lectures Committee. 

Names and related information 
should be submitted in Dean 
Hull's office by Tuesday, Octo-

Regents Clash at Santa Cruz 
The Board of Regents of the 

University of California met last 
Thursday and Friday at UC Santa 
Cruz. The meetings were ac-
companied by several sharp con-
frontations between students and 
Regents. 

The Thursday sess ion con-
sisted of meetings of the Com-
mittee on Grounds and Develop-
ment, the Committee on Educa-
tional Policy, and the Finance 
Committee. 

During the meeting of the De-
velopment Committee, the Re-
gents discussed the future growth 
of UCSC, and the implementation 
of a new sewage system for the 
Veterans' Administration Hospi-
tal connected with the San Diego 
campus. At this point, students 
seemed rather indifferent. 

However, at the afternoon 

meeting of the Educational Poli-
cy committee, several incidents 
occurred. The meeting com-
menced with an address by two 
students , Nguyen Ho and Richard 
Townsend to the Regents. 

Townsend presented the Re-
gents with the following demands: 
l. To continue expanding exper-
imental courses and student sem-
inar programs. The ASUCSC 
supports the Berkeley divis ion of 
the Academic Senate in its de-
sire to secure full course credit 
for Social Analysis 139X. 

2. To support the UFWOC 
grape boycott. The University 
of California should adopt as 
official pollcy the cessation of 
purchasing table grapes. Fur-
ther, amnesty should be granted 
to the 11 Chicanos arrested at 
Berkeley for sitting-in at Pres-

Grads Failure To Vote 

ident Hitch's office. 
3. That the planned Seventh 

College at UCSC should be named 
Malcolm X College and be a col-
lege of black s tudies. 

The students were then as-
s ured by Chairman Boyd that 
these items would be placed on 
the agenda of the gener al meet-
ing to be held on Friday. At 
this point, many students walked 
out of the meeting, angered over 
the decision of the committee not 
to act upon these resolutions 
immediately. 

Regent Dutton then se rved no-
tice on the Committee that he 
intended to raise the issue of 
Social Analysis 139X at the gen-
eral meeting. Implying that 
SAl39X was going to be treated 
as a special case due to the 
presence of Eldridg~ Cleaver, he 
demanded that any modifications 
of the Regents resolutions of the 
September meeting concerning 
guest lecturers apply to all 
classes at all campuses of the 

I University. Cance 5 Futur:e I nvolvemen~ President Hitch stated he in-• ~ Il tended to handle 139X in a non-
Approval ofa constitution which 

would have established a UCSD 
graduate students' association 
failed because of a lack of voter 
turnout. 

ChancelIor McGill had speci-
fied that the results of the vote 
would be binding only if 60% of 
the graduate students on this 
campus partiCipated. The total 
number of votes fell s hort of the 
required total by only about 10 
votes, although the overwhelming 
majority of those voting approved 
the constitution. 

This February there was a 
meeting of grad students to dis-
cuss the formation of some type 
of representative body. A com-
mittee was elected to investigate 
issues that concern grad stu-
dents and to report on the steps 
necessary to forming an or gani-
zation. 

This steering committee drew 
up a report and circulated ques-
tionnaires which sample4 grad 
student opinion on what form 
such an organization should take. 
Since 150 out of the 185 replies 
received voiced support for a 
grad government, the committee 
drew up a constitution in which 
they tried to fulfUl the require-
ments of the majority of students 
as pointed out in the question-
naires--lor example , propor-
tional representation per depart-
ment. 

The committee held a meeting 

with the Chancellor and requested 
that he put a copy of the con-
stitution in the registration pac-
kets. He complied with their re-
quest and an election was sub-
sequently held. To insure that the 
results would be valid, each gra-
duate s tudent was required to 
sign his ballot. 

Of the 640 students voting, 456 
approved and 119 disappr oved the 
constitution. 65 ballots were 
ruled invalid for one reason or 
another. The total of valid ballots 
was approximately 55 ballots 
short of the required figure. 
However, 10 of those 65 ballots 
were blank, so the proposition 
failed, for all intents and pur-
poses, by those 10 blank votes. 

Of those who voted, near ly 
75% approved the constitution, 
so it was not a question of the 
students rejecting the constitu-
tion, but, instead, a result of 
the disinterest of some olthe 1057 
grad s tudents on this campus. 

As a result of the failure of 
the grad student constitution 
there will continue to be a total 
absence of grad student repre-
sentation at UCSD. Sev ral years 
ago, the grad students voted to 
have nothingJo do with ASUCSD, 
so they have no connections with 
the activities of the undergrad-
uates. Also, they do not presently 
have any members on campus 
committees.

similar courses, they would be 
removed from SA 139X. He 
further urged that the Regents 
defer acting upon this issue until 
the November meeting, to be held 
in San Diego. 

The Finance Committee met 
later Thursday afternoon. Such 
items as the awarding of a con-
tract for electrical power at 
UC Santa Barbara, and funding 
appropr iations for additional 
campus pol1cemen were consi-
de red. 

This meeting proceeded in a 
rather bored, orderly fashion 
until a leader of the Black Liber-
ation Movement, Bill Moore, 
strode to the meeting table and 
demanded immediate appr oval of 
the student resolutions presented 
earlier. Students in the ga lleries 
began chanting and demonstrating 
so that further action of the 
committee was impossible. The 
committee adjour ned and beat 
a hasty retreat before the ad-
vancing students coming out of the 
galler ies . 

The Fr iday session consisted 
of a general meeting of the en-
tire Board. It opened with an 
appeal from Chairman Higgs to 
maintain order so that the Board 
could conduct its business. This 
plea was met with applause and 
the mood of the students proved 
to be markedly different from 
that of the previous day. 

Except for the very end of the 
meeting, when Governor Reagan 
was mobbed on his way out of 
the meeting hall, the students 
were generally cooperative. In-
deed, at one point Higgs chided 
the Regents for being much less 
orderly than the audience. 

The meeting got under way 
with several announcements, one 
of which was that the Board 
would definitely act upon the 
students' resolution concerning 
the creation of college of black 
studies at the next meetin in 
'ovember. This was gr eted 

with sustained applause until lax

was met with hi ses. Rafferty

beautiful campuses In California, 
the landscaping, buildings, in-
cluding dormitories are far su-
perior to those at Santa Bar-
bara. AU cltlzens and students 
can be proud of UCSD. The cali-
bre of professors Is superb. The 
overall academic level of the 
students Is to be commended. 
Civilian employees, as a whole 
are proud to say that they are 
part of this great university. Any 
that are not should not be here. 

However, has It ever occurred 
to many of you students, that the 
complete disregard for grounds, 
property and buildings of this 
beautiful campus by some stud-
ents makes one wonder is you are 
really as mature as you want 
that "older generation" to be-
lieve. 1 am continually amazed 
at this disregard by many when 
each day I walk through the cam-
pus and see what Is happening. 

The damaging of elevators, the 
refusal by many to bus their own 
dishes, the tossing of garbage out 
of the dormitory windows and 
around the beautiful grounds, the 
filthy condition you leave the 
tables and fioors of the cafeteria 
atter a meal, the leaving oftrays 
half full of food around on walls, 
etc., to draw vermin. 

It makes one wonder. If when 
you are at home, If you are al-
lowed to damage walls, toss gar-
bage around, destroy property, 
etc. I be lieve that many of your 
parents would be very shocked 
at this and would say "but that 
couldn't be my son or daughter, 
it Is some other person who 
wasn't brought up properly." 

What Is so strange is that dur-
ing the summer months when very 
few students are In attendence 
here. this condition does not 
exist, yet it does now, so there 
must be some "parent's son or 
daughter doing this." It also 
amazes me that the high school 
students who worked here this 
summer, In many Instances dis-
played more responsible action 
than 1 am observing after the 
beginning of the school term. 

So, If you wish to gain the 
respect of the 'civilians', the 
visitors , 'that older generation' 
and have more of them feel that 
you are truly responsible citi-
zens of this country, then you 
are going to have to police your 
own groups and not expect those 
'civilians' to pick up atter you 
and baby you. Be proud of this 
university, and quit allowing it 
to look like a garbage heap.

To the Editor of the Triton 
Times 

This letter was prompted' by 
the article in the Triton Times, 
"Rumper Classlties 'Pigs.' " 
In this article, Mr. Rumper takes 
a popular but highly prejudiced, 
s lanted, and illogical view; he 
regurgitates a lot of garbage for 
the real pigs to "eat up." 

I, for one, do not buy this 
trash and even If I am the only 
one who does not, I will speak 
out against It. I think the 
"doublethink of 1984" is demon-
strated by those who claim to 
be for love and peace, but in-
stead preach hatred and violence. 

Mr. Rumper claims that cri-
minality and brutality are the 
ru Ie rather than the exception. 
I would challenge him to pre-
sent factual evidence to substan-
tiate that claim. He sites the 
incidents at Columbia. in Chi-
cago, and in San Diego as ex- . 
amples. Does M". Rumpel' be-
lIeve, or does 1 expect us to 
believe, that thE e incidents 
believe, that these incidents (or 
any and all the examples he could 
muster) would constitute an ade-
quate representation of all po-
licemen, or even of a major ... 
ty of them? I thinlc not. 

He cannot inter logIcally (as 
if he eared to be locteal. or 

- even Inte lUgent, for that matte r) 
that all police are pigs by using 
the meager evidence at his dis-
posal. Characteristics of a part 
cannot be Inferred to be charac-
teristics of the whole. 

I would say to Mr. Rumper 
that for every bad cop he could 
name, I could name a good one, 
and when he gets to the end 
of his list, I would still have 
a lot of names left. I am 
not saying we should applaud the 
police as a whole because most 
of them are good, but neither 
should we persecute them as a 
whole because some are bad. 

I do not like the actions of 
some policemen any better than 
he does, but I don't think that 
his attack on all policemen should 
go unchallenged. I believe that 
the acts of those officers should 
be condemned and everything 
possible should be done to pun-
ish them. 

I also believe that it takes 
a special kind of man to be a 
pOliceman - a man with a de-
sire to serve, a character, and 
a level of tolerance far super-
ior to most men - including 
various " rabble rousers" who 
shall remain unnamed. When 
a po lice man fails, it is usually 
because his level of tolerance 
has been exceeded. Sometimes 
a word or an insult can cause 
a policeman to "blow his cool." 
Then trouble can begin. 

If a shuffle starts, fellow offi-
cers may come to the aid of 
the officer - even If the trouble 
was his fault originally. That 
is how one mistake can turn 
into a big problem. The man 
who made that mistake should 
be through as a policeman. (I 
do not think that only 45 sub-
stantiated police brutality cases 
out of 10,000 reported is a re-
cord to be proud of - I think 
that it is 45 too many - but 
I will not condemn the entire 
Police Force because of those 
45 cases.) 

These mistakes can cause po-
licemen as a whole to get a 
bad name just because on offi-
cer Is found to be lacking In 
what it takes to be a cop. He 
is human and he has ' erredl. 

It is not my Intention to de-
fend this minority of policemen 
who made mistakes, and espe-
cially not those who would beat 
up on a person for no reason. 
It is my intention to point out 
that these men are In the min-
ority and to defend the majority 
of policemen who are "good 
cops." 

I should like to ask Mr. Rumper 
If he thinks that the trouble at 
Columbia, for Instance, could not 
possibly have been caused, In 
even the smallest way, by the 
students themselves, no matter 
how "glorious" their cause may 
have been. 

As little as my contact with 
the police has been, I have never 
had a problem with a policeman. 
Perhaps that is because I treat 
them with some respect rather 
than with contempt. Perhaps 
they treat people with the same 
respect with which they are 
treated. 

I am not trying to make saints 
out 01 the police - In fact, they 
should not be policemen it they 
cannot take a lot of gulf - but 
I am trying to make It clear 
that the fault Is not entirely on 
the side of the police. 

A policeman's Job is to pre-
serve law and order and to avert 
crime and violence. If some-
body does not like the law and 
order that Is being preserved, 
then the establishment should be 
changed. I do not think the 
present establishment Is so 
great, but neither Is It so bad 
that It has to be torn down. 
Nothing constructive Is to be 
gained by violence. 

Changes violently made are 
done in that maDDer because It 
is the only way a minority can 
torce their unwanted revisions 
upon tile majority. If a change 
is worthwhile It ean be made 
peacefully. Tbe cbanges have 

to be made where the orders 
are given, not where they are 
carried out. 

We do not have to change the 
police police, we have to change 
the laws and orders they en-
force. The police must not go, 
merely the bad laws. No one 
but a starry-eyed ideaUst would 
doubt the need for police to 
enforce whatever the law is. No 
one has the right to arbitrarily 
decide what he will do and what 
he will not. which laws he will 
obey and which he will not. 

If Mr. Rumper has any con-
structive (notice, I said "con-
structive" not "destructive") 
ideas, let him oink, oh. I mean 
speak now or forever hold his 
peace. 

Michael D. Ott 
Editor, Triton Times: 

With his stirring appeal to 
do nothing on Election Day. Her-
man Rumper has established at 
least a school record. That is, 
his head Is deeper In the sand 
than anybody else's. Let us pass 
up a discussion of Mr. Rumper's 
entire fantasy world. and discuss 
one election issue, limitation of 

. the nuclear arms race. It Is the

John Hays 
Editor, the Times 

In 1928 in London, England, 
an athlete representing thE! 
United States of America es-
tablished a tradition which has 
remained intact through the pre-
sent Olympics. This tradition, . 
a failure to dip the flag in di-
ference to the Chief of State 
of the host country is an Insult 
at a magnitude Dot approachable 
by the puny efforts exhibited by 
Tommie Smith and John Carlos. 
That tradition was established as 
a g esture of support for t'le 
Irish Free state and the Irish 
Republican Army, which were 
then attempting to win Indepen-
dance from Great Britan. 

In 1936 in Berlin the gold me-
dalist in the marathon siezed 
upon his sudden fame and used · 
the news media to proclaim to 
the world that he was a Kor-
ean nationalist. At the time 
no politlcai entity existed as 
Korea. The Korean peninsula 
was part and parcel of Japan. 

In 1956 in Melbourne Austra-
lia one of the greatest distance 
runners of all time, Vladimir 
Kuts of the Soviet Union, upon 
winning the first of his two gold 
medals, seized a huge Russian 
flag and ran around the adium 
brandishing it for several min-
utes. 

Also in 1956 In Melbourne most 
of the Hungarian team defected 
to the Western nations. A con-
frontation between the Hungarian

'Regents 
(Cont. 'd from p. 1) 

Hitch then moved to postpone 
consideration of the issue until 
the next meeting of the Regents . 
After little discussion, the mo-
tion was carried. The Regents 
were then preparing to take up 
other business, when Governor 
Reagan interrupted. 

Reagan stated thit he was sure 
that the people ofCalUornia were 
not satisfied with the current 
state of the Cleaver course at 
Berkeley, and that he for one 
was not going to tolerate Re-
gental inaction. Accusing the 
Berkeley division ()f 'sub-
terfuge: Reagan demanded that 
Cleaver not be allowed to appear 
again. (Eldridge Cleaver de-
livered the second of his ten ' 
scheduled lectures at Berkeley 
on the Tuesday before the Re-
gents meeting; for details, fiee 
the last issue of the Triton 
Times). 

Reagan then moved the adoption 
of a resolution some of the fea-
tures of which being that: I . The 
Academic Senate on the various 
campuses shall henceforth have 
no power to authorize or struc-
ture new courses, 2. That the 
awarding of degrees shall be 
subject to review by the Regents. 

Presumably, this means that 
the Regents could deprive a stu-
dent of his degree for political 
reasons, a rather clever inno-
vation by our Guv 'nor. 

He also stated that the facul-
ties ofthe various campuses shall 
have no power to make appoint-
ments to their respective fa-
culties, and that the setting aside 
of Univers ity facilities for SA 
139X at Berkeley is a dirl'ct 
defiance of the Regental rulings 
adopted at the Septembe I' 
meeting. 

There were other less start-
ling proposals which we re lost 
in the hysteria of the moment-
Reagan freaked me out com-
pletely. For· this I apologize, 
but the details are duly recorded 
in the annals of the San Diego 
Union for those interested. 

Reagan's proposal was greeted 
with a feeling of colossal amaze-
ment by the students, which 
quickly turned to anger. How-
ever, they kept cool, and the show 
went on. 

President Hitch questioned 
whether the resolution was 1...1 
)rder at the present time and 
n view of the previous motion 
o deter action on SA 139 X. 
Higgs ruled it in order, but 
his decision was challenged by 
Regent Campbell, who formally 
moved to appeal t he Dec!!: ion of 
the Chair. 

In the following discussion, 
President Hitch argued heatedly 
that Reagan's motion was direct-
ly countermanding to the previous 
motion, and called the pe r-
spectlve adoption of the reso-
lution an 'utter disaste r which 

would destroy the Unive rsity as 
we know it. · 

Hitch also took issue with Rea-
gao's contention that tlte setting 
aside of University facilities for 
Cleaver's class on a non-credit 
basis constituted a subterfuge and 
a defiance of the Regents' re-
solution at the September 
meeting. 

Reagan then raved again about 
the will of the people of Cali-
fornia, but the motion was voted 
as being out of order at that 
time. 

After the vote, Reagan was seen 
angrily jabbering at President 
Hitch, who seemed not to no-
tice . Nonetheless, Reagan's re-
solution was temporar ily set 
aside, but It Is highly probable 
that it will corne up again In 
San Diego. 

Whether it will pass is impos-
sible to predict owing both to the 
lact that many Regents who voted 
it out of order also indicated their 
support for It, and also to the un-
certain bearing the upcoming-
elections will have. It was the 
feeling of one Chancellor that If 
Rafferty is defeated, it will not 
be brought up again . 

Another Chancellor explained 
the motion as a play for power 
by Reagan, stating that he had 
been waiting fo r a long time 
for an issue like SA 139X In 
order to seize greater control 
of the University. 

There are countless factors 
affecting the fate of the reso-
lution and it is impossible to 
tell what the situation will be 
in November .

C oncentus Musicus 
The Concentus Musicus, a bar-

oque chamber ensemble from 
Vienna, will be presented by the 
UCSD Committee for Arts and 
Lectures in Sherwood Hall, 700 
Prospect St., La Jolla, on Wed-
nesday, October 30, at 8:30 p.m. 

The Concentus Musicus was 
founded in 1954 with the basic 
concept of interpreting ancient 
music on the original instruments 

and with uncompromising insis-
tence on performing customs of 
the original period. 

Their repertoire ranges from 
the 13th century music of the 
French School of Notre Dame to 
the music of the iate 18th cen-
tury. 

Wednesday night's program 
will consist of the Concerto for 
Harpsichord in 0 minor by J.

Tickets are available at the 
Arts and Lectures Office, Urey

$1.00. 

Information, guidance, and op-
portunities for action for stu-
dents concerned about the draft 
are avaIlable on the UCSD cam-
pus. 

Objective information for the 
purpose of guidance is the con-
cer of the UCSD Draft Coun-
seling Service located in the 
Student Affairs Office in MC 
250. Run by John Erickson and 
funded by the university, the cen-
ter seeks fo clarify the confu-
sion arising from the 1967 Mil-
itary and Selective Service Act. 

This Act left the destiny of 
graduate students in the control 
of the ir local draft boa rds and 
extended the liabilities incurred 
by a student when he gets a 
ll-S deferment. 

This year, about \0 to 15 stu-
dents per day have visited the 
counseling office with questions 
ranging from simple: "How does 
information about my status as 
a student get from UCSD to my 
draft board?" (Ans: The card 
you filled out at registration 
is sent to the UC LA data pro-
cessing center which then auto-
matically issues form 11409 to 
your local board) to the diffi-
cult questions of a grad student 
working in the national interest 
who has been classified I-A. 

The center Is part of a UC 
wide system coordinated by Les 
Rothenberg at UC LA. Rothen-
~rg's book, TheDraftand You, 
WIll be available at (he campus 
bookstore in November and con-
tains the most re liable infor-
mation on the draft. 

Within two to three weeks, the 
center w1ll have a booklet of 
its own, "The UCSD Student and 
the Draft." 

A complete reference library 
on the draft will soon open in

will also have a bulletin board 
of the latest memoranda, etc. 
from the Selective Service Of-
fices. 

starting next issue, questions 
of general interest about the 
draft will be answered in a week-
ly ~olumn in this paper. Please 
leave your questions in written 
form with John Ericksoil or at 
the Triton Times office." 

"Every case with the draft 
is really an individual matter ," 
stated John, and to offer that 
personal se rvice not to be found 
in draft literature, John, along 
with Les Atkinson and Father 
Ernie Mort of the campus min-
istery, will offer group and per-
sonal counseling by appointment. 
The available hours are posted 
outside the center office. 

Some advice John offered to 
any potentiai draftee is to start 
early to build a written file with 
your draft board, including your 
medical reports, progress in 
school, thoughts on the draft, and 
inquiries about special military 
programs or alternative fOTmso! 
service. 

This should be done no matter 
what point of view you now have, 
for the longer you wait, the fewer 
choices will be yours. 

A 3-4 day orientation program 
about the draft with seminars 
and guest speakers (inc. Les 
Rothenburg) is in the planning 
stages now. 

The other on-campus group 
offering draft counseling. ser-
vices, the students for a Demo-
cratic Society (sds), will extend 
the orientatlonprogram withses-
sions designed to train draft 
counselors but open to all stu-
dents. These sessions will be 
a first stage in setting up a 
draft counseling service parallel 
to the center's, but with a poli-
tical orientation. 

It will provide facts, like the 
center, but will also offer in-
volvement with others in the same 
situation and an opportunity to 
explore what they can do about 
that situation. The sds hopes 

• that out of this will grow a draft 
union for the purpose of organized 
resistance to the draft. 

Essentially, both group's ob .. 
jectives are the same: to provide 
reliable information for all male 
students of UCSD. 

Academic Senate 
Opened toStudents 

The meeting of the UCSD Aca-
demic Senate last Tuesday could 
prove to be of overwhelming 
importance to UCSD students. 
This body, of which every facul-
ty member is a voting member, 
has thus far kept its meeting 
closed to students. . 

However, after a suggestion 
from Dr. Goodkin, faculty re-
presentative on the A.S. Senate, 
that student' obse rve rs be allowed 
to attend meetings in the future, 
a motion carried nearly unani-
mously to allow two undergra-
duate and two graduate students 
to attend all future meetings. 

They will be non-voters, but 
wUl be allowed to participate 
in all other ways. The acutal 
method of choosing student re-
presentatives, and deciding whe-
ther or not other students should 
be allowed in as space permits, 
wUl be discussedatthe November 
meeting.

Hard Lucie Soy 
On October 5, one might have 

noticed a very beautiful thing 
happening in the Revelle cafe-
teria during lunch and dinner-
a certain band was playing and 
living and existing and breathing 
the blues with aU of their heart, 
body and soul. 

With the exception of the cafe-
teria staff, nearly everyone was 
both astounded and amazed at the 
brilliance and the originality of 
John Harrelson (vocals and the 
harp), Bob Brink (lead guitar), 
Ray Konkel (bass) and Mike Mon-
taleone (drums). 

The group is HARD LUCK BOY. 
People have been talking about 
thts band ever since the fifth, 
but few knew its name. Don't 
dare forget it-Hard Luck Boy 
has a sound that is unbelievable 
and unforgetable. 

Bob Brink is a student here at 
UCSD, while John, Ray and Mike 
attend school up in the Pomona-
Claremont-Ontario area. The 
group has been together about 
seven months, but each ot the 
men has piayed or sang for about 
four years before they got to-
gether in February ot 1968. 
Hard Luck Boy is one of the 
most highly idealistic groups that 
exist today and have definite 
ideas about commercial use ot 
their fantastic talents. 

They play the blues because 
it's simply their thing, one in 
which they feel that both as Hard 
Luck Boy and as individuals they 
can be the most creative and the 
most original. Those who have 
seen them perform must agree 
that their spontane lty is above 
reproach. 

Yet there are other areas that 
make the group such an exciting 
one to listen to or to dance to, as 
one teels inclined. The amount of 
emotion given off by John Harrel-
son as he harps "Spoonful" send 
chills up one's back. 

When Mike Montaieone smash-
es his way through a drum solo, 
the listener can almost fee I the 
total involvement Mike has with 
such an inanimate object as a 
pe rcussiOll set. 

When Bob and Ray begin a 
spontaneous, ad-libbed guitar 
solo (most of Hard Luck Boy's 
material is basicaUy adl1bbed 
solo within a blue s structure), 
one teels merely awed in the 
presence of talent such as that 
which has been demonstrated be-
fore only rarely by other groups. 

Hard Luck Boy's greatest asset 
is the enormous amount of musi-
cal idealism they possess. Tot-
ally dedicated to musiC, and more 
specifically to the blues, they 
feel absolutely no desire to enter 
top-40 teenybopper radio unless 

October 25, l~€e age 5 
they can play their material their 
way. 

*. TRIDENT * ......................................................... -............... ......... ... 
This is perhaps the greatest

mendous amount of sinceritythat

It ts as close to making love 
to these instruments that Bob, 
Ray, Mike and John can possibly 
come to, and the resulting sound 
is one of sheer soulful, emotion-
al bliss, both for the group and 
the audience. It's spontaneous, 
it's original, it's greatly uncom-
promised by today's commercial 
rat race, it's beautiful, it's a trip 
without drugs. Hard Luck Boy 
doesn't need dope to get stoned. 

They have the blues of Howlin' 
Wolf, Albert King, Willie Dixon 
and the great blues men of time 
today and time past to play. And 
when they piay, the audience 
grooves and gets stoned on the 
music with them. 

The acceptance that Hard Luck 
Boy has gained at UCSD shows 
both our appreciation of good 
music and the talent of a group 
that is truly "where it's at." 

The University Library at the 
University of California, San Di-
ego, has obtained a major col-
lection, the Della Vida Library, 
Melvin J. Voigt, university li-
brarian, announced recently. 

The Della Vida Library is an 
outstanding near- Eastern library 
of more than 4,000 volumes. 

Professor G. levi Della Vida 
was one of the world' s foremost 
scholars in near Eastern litera-
ture, history and languages and 
had a long and dtstinguished ca-
reer at the University of Rome. 

In 1964 Voigt visited with Pro-
fessor Della Vida and purchased 
a nearly complete set of "Revue 

des Deux Mondes". At that 
time, Professor Della Vlda was 
W1lling to consider having the 
near Eastern collection go to 
UCSD but was not ready to make 
a final decision. 

Most of tbe volumes 10 the 
Delia Vida Library are out-of-
print items, many published be-
fore 1900. Included are mono-
graphic sets published by schol-
arly societies and universities, 
basic reference works, diction-
aries, encyclopedias, historical 
works, treatises on archaeology, 
languages and culture, as well 
as an excellent coUection of lit-
erary works in Arabic.

IBM invites you to join an infant industry. 

Big as it is, the information processing 
industry is just beginning to grow. 
Recently, Fortune estimated that the value 
of general purpose computers 'installed in 
this country will .more than double by 1972. 
Other publications have other predictions, 
and probably no source is totally precise. But 
most agree that information processing is 
one of America 's fastest growing major 
industries. . 

Every day, it seems, c;omputers go to work 
in a new field or new application. IBM com-
puters are working in such diverse f ields as 
business, law, medicine, oceanography, 
traffic control, air pollution. Just about any 
area you can name. 
To somebody just starting out, this growth 
means exceptionally good chances for 
advancement. Last year, for example, we 
appointed over 4,000 managers-on 
performance, not seniori ty. Here are four 
ways you could grow with IBM: 

Engineering and Science 
"The interdisciplinary 
environment keeps 
you technologically 
hot." 

"Working in data process-
ing today pretty much means 
you work in a broad spectrum 
of technologies," says Nick 
Donofrio. 
An Associate Engineer at IBM, Nick is a 
1967 graduate in Electrical Engineering. 
He's using his technical background to de-
sign circuits for computer memory systems. 
Nick says, "Your specialty at IBM can take 
you into the front yard of half a dozen dif-
ferent fields. In my job, for example, I work 
with systems design engineers, chemists, 
physicists, metallurgists, and programmers. 
The diversity helps me keep up to date on 
the latest technologies." 
Career areas in engineering and science 
at IBM include: Research, Design & Develop-

Other reascn$to consider IBM 
1. Small Te"rr:) Concept. No matter how large 
a project m iy be, we break it down into 
units small ~ r1ough to be handled by one 
person or a few people. Result: quick recog-
nition for ac hlevemenl. 

2. Educatio 1C!1 Support. IBM employees 
spend over thirteen million hours a year in 
company-stJonsored educational and training 
programs. And plans like our Tuition 

ment, Manufacturing, Product Test, Space 
and Defense Project~ , and Field Engineering. 
You 'll need at least a B.S. in any technical field. 

Marketing 
"Working with 
company presidents 
is part of the job." 

" I'm pretty much the 
IBM Corporation in 
the eyes of my 
customers," says 
Andy Mora n. " I 
consider that fa irly good for an engineer 
who graduated only two years ago." 
Andy earned his B.S.E.E. in 1966. Today, 
he's a Marketi ng Representative with IBM, 
involved in the planning, selling and installa-
tion of data processing systems. 
Andy's customers include companies with 
annual sales ranging from 20 million 
to 120 million dollars. He often works 
with executive vice-presidents and presi-
dents. Andy says, " At first I was a little 
nervous about the idea of advising execu-
tives at that level. But by the time I finished 
training, I knew I was equipped to do the job." 
Career areas in marketing at IBM include: 
Data Processing Marketing and Systems 
Engineering, Office Products Sales, and 
Information Records Sales. Degree require-
ment: B.S. or B.A. in any field. 

Finance 
"You're in an ideal 
spot to move 
ahead fast." 

"I've always figured my 
chances for advance-
ment would be beUer 
in a growth industry. 
That's why I picked 
IBM," says Joe Takacs. 
Joe's been working 
in general accounting

Editor's Note: 
Dr. carmack has been con-

ducting studies and v15ltlng Guat-
emala oft and on for 14 years. 
This Includes some three years 
total time, including about 14 
months In Guatemala CUy, and 
16 months in peasant communi-
ties In Western Guatemala. His 
most recent trip to Guate mala 
was last Summer, where he was 
present at the Hme of the assas-
sination of the American Ambas-
sador. 

At the present time he is con-
sultant for" Ayuda" , a non-profit 
corporation, which next year will 
begin to give technical aid to 
peasant communities In Guate-
mala. 

by Robert M. Carmack 

In view of the impossibUUy, at 
the time, of making myd15agree-
ments with Rev. Bonpane heard, 
I teel constrained to write these 
few comments. It was discon-
certing to observe the little con-
cern on the part of our students 
(at least most ofthose who asked 
questions) for any semblance of 
unbiased fact and faithful ac-
curacy. 

I fear we were served a d15h 
of slogans and e motion-laden tid-
bits prepared to satisfy the par-
ticular tasks of the hungry youths 
gathered around the table. 

Let it be clear that there is no 
argument against the usefulness 
of lectures such as that of Rev. 
Bonpane. On the contrary, they 
arouse Interest in the serious 
problems confronting us, and de-
mand we continually re-examine 
our actions and policies. 

However, we must not be lulled 
into an unquestioning acceptance 
of asserted "facts", and then 
use them as assumptions for 
further "Inquiry". This is no 
time for young people to rest on 
past laurels, for honesty and free 
inquiry are qualities which re-
quire unstinting vigil. 

Lest there be any misunder-
standing from what follows, I 
w11l state that in my view some 
of Rev. Bonpane's basic evalua-
tions are accurate: i.e., that our 
past relations with Latin America 
have not beenenl1ghtened; a more ' 
humanitarian approach is des-
perately needed; countries like 
Guatemala have critical social 
and economic lnequal1ties and 
problems; Latin Americans 
should be allowed to develop 
their own social destiny (free of 
external contro15). 

But having pointed to a' few 
of the many premises Rev. Bon-
pane and I would share, I would 
like to take exception to some 
of the supposed "facts.. upon 
which he based his inte rpretation 
and plan for Guatemala. 

I will do this by discussing 
only what I consider to be his 
most damaging distortion of 
facts: the assertion that Guate-
malans know what they want,

and that the guerrillas express 
and represent that knowledge and 
desire. I suggest that we must 
ask this question: Which Guate-
malans? 

Are they the Indians, who con-
stitute over 50% of the popula-
tion? The answer must certainly 
be no, for Bonpane himself clas-
sUies them as a "mystery". 

Then are they the Ladinos of 
the Indian area? Again the an-
swer is no, for they are notori-
ously moderate-to-conservative 
In politics. 

Nor can they be the new mid-
dle class in OJatemala City, who 
now constitute perhaps 20-30% 
of the urban population. Like 
most middle classes they are 
pol1t1cally moderate (by Guate-
malan standards). 

Then they must be the lower 
classes of Guatemala City and 
the Mestizos of the East and the 
Southern Coast-that segment of 
the population which both suf-
fers most from and Is partially 
aware of social inequalities. I 
believe they are potential revolu-
tionaries, though at the present 
time they are not. 

This Is admitted by Rev. Bon-
pane (perhaps Inadvertently), 
when he refers to the revolution-
arle s as intellectuals. But it 15 
most clearly shown by the small 
s ize of the guerrlla band, which 
In spite of some 8 years of at-
tempted recruitment has failed 
to increase in numbers, In the 
Eastern and Coastal areas. 

Finally, I am certain that no 
one will argue that the group 
to represent the guerrillas In 
Guatemala should be the upper 
class of wealthy landowners. 

In summation, we are left with 
the "lntellectuals"-students and 
professors of soc ial science. 
This 15 partially true, though it 
must be that, to my knowledge, 
no professor has joined the band 
(there have been sympathizers), 
and only a limited number of 
students have joined. 

properly be classified as "in-
tellectuals" (a ter m used far too 
loosely these days). Certainly, 
the mere label of "student" 
should not warrent such an epi-
thet. 

Further, we know that the band 
Includes former Armypersonnel, 
who are obviously not always 
Intellectuals (but no always Ig-
noramuses either, in spite of 
Rev. Bonpane's Insinuations). 

Whether or not the guerrillas 
Include "soclal15ts" from other 
Latin American countries Is not 
certain. Interestingly, Rev. Bon-
pane's remark about the Cuban 
girl wanting to be sent to Guate-
mala as a revolutionary may be 
an indication that Cubans are In 
Guatemala. 

In all sincerity, it seems a 
gross distortion to state that the 

, guerrillas, a micro-minority In 
Guatemala, somehow represent 
the will of Guatemalans. As in 
all complex societies, there are 
many social wills In Guatemala, 
and the guerrillas represent only 
that of a tiny minority. One can 
only conclude that Rev. Bonpane 
accepts the guerrillas as the 
representatives of Guatemalans 
because he happens to be in basic 
agreement with their methods 
and aims. Yet, I suspect he is 
a victim of his own distortions, 
for I doubt that he would want 
to be a party to the assassina-
tion of Innocent pollcement, civi-
lians, and even an Ambassador. 
InCidentally, our notably apoliti-
cal Ambassador did run, but It 
should also be noted that the 
guerrilla leader did not hesitate 
to give the order, "Kill him!" 

It Is paradoxical to discover 
that, contrary to what Rev. Bon-
pane would have us believe, he 
is one of the worse offenders of 
externally Interfering with Guat-
emala's destiny. By supporting 
(openly and active ly) the revolu-
tionaries , a micro-minority de-
cidedly not representative of 
Guatemalans (who are divided, 
but not to that extent), he is 
helping this group in their at-
tempt to impose a political and 
social system on the populace. 

My own opinion, said as it 
may be, is that most Guatemalans 
want another military dictator, 
and ! fear that their next elec-
tion will bring them just t~t. 

I know this from personal ac-
quaintance with a few students 
and faculty In key positions, out 
it 15 best seen in the continuation 
of the social science program at 
the University. Only recently the 
students in a massive demon-
stration of unity struck against 
the gene ral education requlre- I believe that most of the 
ments of the University, and won Guatemalan "facts" crucial to 
an Important victory (and in the Bonpane's arguments are open 
process demonstrated their in- to skeptical criticism similar to 
terest and willingness to work the above. I found his Cuban 
within the broad framework of data fascinating and hopeful, but 
present social institutions). In view of his mistreatment of 

Actually we know very little the Guatemalan situation they 
about the guerrillas, so It 15 should be viewed with at least 
not even certain that they may strong reservations.

Regent Forbes 
on Cleaver 
by RICHARD SHARP and LESLIE on the Regents' judgement"? 

LINCOLN 

(Reprinted with the permission 
of New University, UCI) 

William J. Forbes, president 
of Southern Call10rnia Music Co-
mpany, director of Bell Brand 
Foods, and Regent, gave a pene-
trating analysis of the working 
of the Board in connection with 
the Regents' decision to limit 
Eldridge Cleaver to one lecture 
on the Berkeley campus. Forbes 
was interviewed before Cleaver 
spoke Thursday. 

Q. Why did you vote for the 

I think that I'd prefer not to 
discuss their motives or the vote 
of anyone member of the board 
beyond my own. I think It would 
be presumptuous on my part to 
attempt to judge the Governor. 
Q. Did the number of letters 
that Governor Reagan did re-
ceive have any effect on your 
judgment? 

No. (Pause) Do you know the 
elapsed amount of time between 
the moment the course was an-
nounced and the Governor's re-
action to it? 

resolution to limit Cleaver to No, I don't. 
one lectur~? 

This would be extremely dif-
ficult to sum up in a few words. 
We spent several hours in the 
Educational Policy Committee on 
Thursday and had a reasonably 
full discussion. Not all of the 
Regents were present and it came 
before the full Board on Fri-
day. As I recall, there were 
three or four roll call votes on 
diCterent phases of this thing. 
You're referring to the last one, 
of course. The reasons for voting 
a certain way must come in the 
context of a long discussion and 
it was my fee ling that it was 
the proper way to vote. 

Q. For what reasons did you feel 
this was the proper way to vote? 

I felt that the course should 
be given and that Mr . Cleaver 
should be a part of it and my 
vote meant that it would happen. 
Clea ver would speak once instead 
of two times as the President 
(Hitch) originally recommended. 
But it had been previously re-
ported that President Hitch pulled 
his vote from two lectures to 
one. 

Q. Are you personally against 
having Cleaver as a lecturer 
for ten appearances as he was 
scheduled? 

A lecture r was the capacity 
in Which the Board approved 
Mr. Cleaver's appearance •.• 
[ voted for it. 

Q. Yes, you voted to let Clea-
ver lecture once. But would you 
be in favor of Cleaver lecturing 
at ten class sessions if the board 
had not limited him? 

[ think this Is an if - y que s-
Uon now. I would refer you to 
the full body of our discussion 
last week. 

Q. Then, you're not personally, 
against having Cleaver as a lec-
turer. How would you feel about 
employing Cleaver as an instruc-
tor? 

We're talking about the plan 
under which the President re-
commended that Mr. Cleaver 
participate, My vote indicated •.• 

Q. Yes, your vote indicated you 
favored him as a lecturer. But 
how would you feelaboutemploy-
inC Cleaver as an instructor? 

This is a matter that comes 
to the board through proper chan-
nels. Through proper academic 
and administrative channels. [ 
think we would judge at that 
time the recommendation of the 
President. 

Q. Do you feel that Governor 
Reagan, when he brought up this 
issue, was acting under a man- ' 
date of the people ? We noted 
that he made a point of all tbe 
letters he bad received DRlOSinC 
the appearance of Cleaver as 
a lecturer for tile course. Do 
you th1l* tbis bad any ~lnC 

I think this is rather pertin-
ent. (Pause) 
Q. Well, how long was it? 

I don't know. But I think this 
would be good to know. 

Q. In light of the Cleaver issue, 
under what conditions do you 
think the Regents should review 
decisions in academic matters? 

Essentially we should review 
matters that are brought to us 
by the president. The Board 
is essentially one to determine 
policies and nol get into oper-
ations. Although any Regent has 
the right to put a subject on 
the agenda, we basically dis-
cuss the issues raised by Pres-
ident Hitch. 

Q. But the Cleaver Issue was 
put to the Board by Governor 
Reagan. 

Yes. 

Q. Don't you feel that the Re-
gents' decision in this matter 
will have a detrimental effect 
on academic freedom and speci-
fically the Academic Senate's 
right to create courses and hire 
lecturers? Do you think this wlll 
be a trend? 

[ think it's too ear I y to make 
a proper judgment on this. This 
has been a subject that' s burst 
upon the scene very suddenly. 
We made a decision and [think 
now this Is being evaluated by 
all the University administrators 
and members of the Academic 
Senates and Academic Council. 
I think it's too early to judge. 

(Cont'd. from p. 3) 
and Russian Water Polo teams 
(the two best in the world at 
the time) resulted in a bloody 
battle which was finally called 
to prevent murder. That is not 
an exaggeration. 

According to our selt righteous 
olympic committee this had no-
thing to do with the recently 
supressed ReVOlution in Hungary. 

In 1968 two human beings, who 
believe that our society is so 
structured that no black American 
can truly tee I human, had the 
courage to say to the world that 
they are in tact human. 

In a statement replete with lIes 
the U.S. Olympic committee saw 
fit to publlcly censure these peo-
ple. It must be apparent that 
the U.S. Olympic Committee re-
gards black athletes to be pre-

Don DavlSl 
on the Pot I 
A poster recently appeared in 

several conspicuous gathering 
places on campus. Claire Biddle, 
a California legislator, was to 
speak for the legal1zatlon of 
marijuana (pronounced grass). 

This propOSition has outraged 
many right-thinking citizens and 
students. n has also delighted 
many paranoid potheads and tired 
cops. From the controversy con-
cerning this propOSition it seems 
that one of society's big problems 
today is that of the proper way 
to get high. 

However, the legalization of 
marijuana would not offer an ef-
fective solution to this problem. 
If marijuana were legal it would 
be no fun. 

If marijuana were legalized, 
then a whole new industry would 
be created. There would be mari-
juana saloons, where smoka-
holics would gather and order a 

~ixed joint oftheir favorite brand 
cut with tobacco. These cock-
tails would have such names as 
the Mexican Mindrope, or, for 
the sophisticated heterosexual, 
the High-Ball. And for heartier 
smokers who would presumably 
smoke it straight ("a double, and 
leave the lid, bartender") there 
would be diseases such as Gal-
loping ObliVion, a terminal high 
characterized by stuttering, ob-
livious attempts to plead "j- j-
just one m-m-more, p-please?". 
At high-class social functions, 
guests would smoke a hearty 
toast to the guest of honor using 
sterling silver monogrammed 
roach holders. and then groove 
on the aperitifs . 

In all this new freedom con-
cerning drugs, there would be 
no fun. 

Presently, when the sight of a 
squad car brings chills to every 
pothead's spine, at least there is 
an adventurous element ofuncer-
tainty which makes life a little 
less boring than it would be other-
Wise., If S3ddenly the whole thing 
was condoned, students would 
have only the possibilityoffiunk-
ing out of school and dying in 
Vietnam to excite them. 

And some students, who have 
an inborn need for excitement and 
uncertainty in their lives, would 
no doubt begin to play the game 
of how little they can work and 
still stay in school. 

So now, when the campus pot- ' 
heads are sitting In parked cars 
casting furtive glances over their . 
shOulders or freaking out in the 
woods lis tening for sounds of 
footsteps, when a mellowcloudof 
smoke rises delicately above the 
trees of Camp Matthews, theyall 
s hould take a few moments to ap-
preciate the excitement which the 
risk of a few months in jail adds 
to their lives, enrichingtheirex-
periences, keeping them from 
fiunking out and savlngthem from 
cirrhosis of the liver.

a black athlete attempts to gain 
that voice which has been sys-
tematically denied him In his 
native country is it deemed ne-
cessary to censure the athlete 
for his temerity. 

The O.C. should be ashamed 
of its action. The action is un-
excusable and the honorable thing 
for them to do at this time would 
be apologize publicly to Tommie 
Smith and John Carlos. The 
true spirit ot the Olympics is 
not realizable in a worldinwhich

OPera~'orl okyo 
Farmer 1, Suitor 0 

Thursday of last week, the 
Nlki-Kal Opera Troupe of Tokyo 
performed at Sherwood Hall here 
in La Jolla. I must say that it 
was a rare treat indeed. 

There wer~ , of course, a few 
minor difficulties which were en-
countered in my efforts to fully 
appreciate the manifestations of 
haut couture and gentility. At 
least, I assume that's what was 
going on. 

I was struck almost immedi-
ately by the lyrical sing-song 
atmosphere of the performance. 
The players' words seemed to 
fairly now off their lips, !luttpr 
through the air, and descend upon 
the uncomprehending ears of the 
audience. 

Oh, well, that's par for the 
course in Grand Opera; you aren't 
really expected to notice the 
words-just the arias. And, in 
many ways, Japanese is more 
enjoyable to listen to than Italian. 

The plot (of which I was in-
formed earlier) revolves around ' 
the courtship of a nobleman's 
daughter. There are three suit-
ors: two Imbeciles and the good 
guy, a farmer . •• The three of 
them engage in all manner of 
contest to Impress the old man 
and win the fair young maiden. 

In the midst of all this com-
petition, the daughter becomes 
bored one night and puts on a 
devil mask. 

There she lies in her bedroom, 
small and frail wearing the mask. 
In trips one of the imbeciles, 
hoping to seduce the charming 
girl. He sees the mask and races 
out of the room hollering bloody 
murder (in Japanese?). 

The next Idiotic suitor runs 
out to Investigate, with papa close 
on his heels. He sees the devil 
mask, and shrinks cowering to 
the fioot mats. 

Then, in a triumphal entrance, 
the fum hick st r ide s Into tile 
bedroom to wage divine t..ttle 

with the satanic monster. The 
struggle commences but ends 
soon enough as the farmer (and 
the father notice who is really 
behind the devil mask. 

The farmer and hls beloved 
embrace, the father looks dis-
approvingly upon the other two 
suitors, and all live happily ever 
after. 

The costumes were typical con-
sidering the circu mstances (it 
takes place in Japan), and showed 
off the players to best advantage 
in resplendant colours. 

Perhaps there is just a slight 
credibility gap in the plot. But 
in Grand Opera, you aren't sup-
posed to noUce the plot, only the 
arias. 

The sets were quite piain, as is 
Japanese llfe. (I mean, really, 
11 a devil -masked boy-girl 
wrestling match is the most ex-
citing thing you can think of to 
write an Opera about, things must 
be pretty low-key in Japan).

Stanley Kubrick's monumental 
film epic "2001: A Space Odys-
sey" has been the source of a 
storm of controversy and criti-
cal discussion since Its re lease 
over five months ago. 

Rejected by New York erltlcs 
In April, edited and cut 20 min-
utes, l'e-released and lauded ever 
since " it will continue to puzzle 
and awe its viewers for some 
time. No attempt to review the 
major films of 1968 can be re-
garded as an authentic one with-
out a consideration even at this 
date, of Kubrick's "2001". 

"2001" is as technically and 
imaginatively staggering as It is 
disquieting. It is unsurpassed In 
film history In both Its beauty 
and sophistication of visual ima-
gery. The cinerama camera does 
not merely give us a film about 
space travel, but one in which we 
fee I ourselves actually partici-
pating In an odyssey through the 
depths of outer space. 

The first half of the fi1 m con-
cerns the dawn 01 man, and his 
discovery of the first tool which 
launches us into the year 2001 
where lunar colonies are already 
well-established. Mutually re-
volving space stations and craft 
are Ingeniously scored to St rauss 
waltzes and other romantic melo-
dies. 

Soon a black rectangular mono-
lithic slab is unearthed which 
sends out an upper-harmonic 
shriek In the direction of Jupiter, 
leading to a mission to the huge 
planet and to an atte mpt by the 
craft's all too human computer 
H.A. L. to usurp command.

Some think the best standard to live by is 
what "works." 

But what "works" today often doesn't 
"work" tomorrow. Material standards are 
changeable and fallible. 

The only standard that doesn't change is 
the one that can make the most difference in 
your life. It is God's spiritual standard of 
excellence.

Insanely belleves a space mis-
sion is more precious than human

something of this Insanity by be-
lieving that his fallible race can

Kubrick is warning us against 
an over-reliance on technology 
carried to such an extent that 
it begins to dominate and dlrect 
human life and potential and 
causes us to forget human need. 

"2001" Is purely a visual film. 
The acting is nil and the dialogue 
and narration has been stripped 
away to 50 minutes of the three 
hour length. Kubrick relies on 
visual Images, sound, and some 
indescribable new techniques to 
tell his story. There has ob-
viously been an extremely pain-
staking devotion to scientifiC 
truth and detail. 

Routine shots Involved separ-
ate photography of astronauts, 
spacecraft, planets, and star 
fields which had to be meticu-
lously blended Into a single scene. 
Kubrick even Invented for "2001" 
a means ofprojectlon where fUm-
ed backgrounds which are indis-
tinguishable from reality can be 
used in the studio. 

After intermission, the film 
could very well be re-entitled 
"2001' A Space Oddity". Theex-
perience Is similar to reading 
about two-thirds of Homer's 
"Odyssey", turning the page and

Jackson Pollack. 

After rendering H.A. L. inop-
erative the surviving astronaut 
approaches Jupiter and we are 
confronted with an or gy of color: 
patterns of shifting hues and pln-
balling lights. The astronaut and 
his craft perform actions not 
explainable by currently known 
physical laws. He has been swept 
out of time and space by contact 
with a superior Intelligent life, 
perhaps of pure energy. 

The surrealistic ending Is tot-
ally puzzling as the astronaut 
undergoes a death and transfigur-
ation Into an embryo. ultimately 
returning to earth as possibly 
a new race of man. 

But Kubrick meant to awe and 
daze his audience. He Intended 
to cause an emotional response 
of wonder and to provoke thought, 
not merely enlighten. 

To lovers of science fiction, 
the film holds an unending fas-
cination. For those uninterested 
In such a world, it could prove 
a somewhat s lowmovlng experi-
ence with too llttle stress on plot 
and human drama. However, even 
to these viewers, "2001" wUl 
prove an impressive, visually 
stunning odyssey. 

Revelle College's Interhall 
Council met for the second time 
last Monday night and elected 
Mark Waxman as their new chalr-
main for the year. The results 
of a search by Interhall council 
members of their respective 
dorms or floors revealed an 
astounding amount of cafeteria 
utensils had been recovered. 

At their first meeting the coun-
cil had met with an official of 
the High Continental company to 
discuss various aspects of the 
food service. They were told that 
the frequent shortage of dishes, 
silverware , and trays was mainly 
due to students who take food up 
to their rooms. 

It was decided that council 
members would try to recover 
what they could. The Inventory 
of recovered items was as tol-
lows: 104 trays , 170 plates of 
varying sizes, 151 glasses, 35 
cups, 83 teaspoons, 28 desert 

spoons, 29 knives, and 37 forks. 
The council issued a plea at 

their meeting for students who 
take food up to their rooms to 
please return any cafeteria i-
tems. 

A regular meeting time was 
scheduled for the re s t of the 
year. Interhall council will meet 
Monday nights at 7: 00 In the 
Blake Hall Conference r oom. The 
council consists of representa-
tives from each of the six-unit 
dorms and from each floor of 
Argo and Blake halls. 

The purpose of the council is 
to deal with aU matter s of direct 
concern to resident students of 
Revelle College. 

Applications are available at 
Ann Conklin' s office in Argo Hall 
for the positions of secretary 
and treasurer for the council. 
Aiso, two positions are available 
on the Housing Policy committee 
for Interested students.

24 October 1968 

In a meeting conducted with extremely good manners and with 
great decorum, the AS Senate met Tuesday and considered several 
of the important issues facing the students of UCSD. 

President Tom Shepard, In his report told the gathering abo~t 
the Faculty Senate resolution that would allow students to particl-
pate in the meetings as non voting members. 

Shepard, very enthusiastic about the resolution, mentioned that 
a change In the by-laws of the faculty body w11l allow these student 
observers to attend on a regular basis, s ince the resolution now only 
mentions the s tude nt observers In a temporary capacity. 

The Regents me!!tlng :It UC Santa Cruz was discussed at length. 
It was noted that the Regents will visit UCSD soon and that a re-
ception of some sort will be expected by the Regents. 

At the meeting In Santa Cruz one girl was actually suspended for 
attempting to address the Regents, but she was reinstated. Presi-
dent Shepard is Cc)Dc'lrned about the reaction that the Regents may 
undergo a hostile reception from the students here s imilar to the 
one received at Santa Cruz. 

In other business , a motion was passed directing the represent-
atives of the AS to request that by-laws and communications board 
policies he passed before making any future Policy decis ions . The 
problems of the communications board were presented and discussed 
at length. 

Later In the meeting, a resolution was passed regarding the at-
tempts by the Regents and the state government to take polltlcal 
control of the Unive r sity of CaWornia and to use it as a political 
tool. The resolution was introduced by President Shepard. 

A motion was also passed concerning the TNC issue of the meet-
ing. The motion made provisions for a letter to TNC by the Senate 
expressing dissatisfaction with the Cleaver lecture and directed the 
program board to take responsibility for the actions of the events 
given under its auspices. The motion would therefore make such 
things as the neglection of the UCSD students at the Cleaver lecture 
by TNC virtually Impossible without severe repercussions. 

A resolution Introduced by Jeff Benjamin was passed. The re-
solution said that students should be allowed to address the Regents, 
when they meet here in November, as a regularly scheduled artlele 
of business and wlll be sent to the chancellor and hopefully passed , 
on to the Regents. 

A questionnaire wm also be sent out to the students involving their 
opinion of the recent actions of both the Regents a.ndGovemor Reagan. 
Also In the near future Is acoocert on November 22nd, featuring Quick-
silver Messenger Ser vice a.nd Hard Luck Boy. More information 
on that will be a.vallable soon.

How Should We Handle 

Triton Soccer Improves 
at All-Cal Tournament 

Olympic Controversy? 
by Larry Raful 

Probably the greatest sports 
controversy of the past two weeks 
has been at the 19th summer 
olympic games in Mexico City. 

UCSD's young soccer team 
came out of last weekend's All 
Cal soccer meet In Berkeley 
smelling like a rose despite thelr 
three loses and ove rail eighth 
place finish, Coach Peter Sertlc 
said, "Thls Is the best soccer 
we've ever played", and he polnt-
ed to the low scores as proof. 

UCSD came back on a com-
bination of good passes topped 
off by a 20- foot kick by forward 
Steve Hirsch. The Tritons had 
other opportunities as they miss-
ed a penalty kick and couldn't 
connect on their corner kicks. 

~:iiI~(;::=:JII Two events which have centered 
on the U.S. teams were: 1. in 
the opening ceremony, the U.S. 

But even more importantly, 
the U.S. shouldn't have removed 
Carlos and Smith. I believe 
the protest was in good taste 
and had a partieular significance 
to our country. It's sad that 
the state of affairs In our coun-
try necessitates this kind otpro-
test, but the U.S. D.C. cannot be 
so blind as to forget all poli-
tics. 

_..o.;~, ,~ ....... "'S was the only team not to dip 

The Triton's first game was 
Thursday, Oct . 17 against another 
young teamtrom UC irvine, which 
UCSD lost 1- 0. UCSD charged 
right out at the kickoff and played 
aggressively as in the other two 
games. 

The ball was on the irving side 
of the field 80 percent of the 
time, and the defense did a fine 
job of backing up the offense. 
The ball just didn't seem to go 
through the goal, though, as UCSD 
had a dozen shots and no less 
than six corner kicks In the first 
half. 

The second half was more ofthe 
same with tough play by the Tri-
tons and many opportunities to 
scor e. But bad breaks, a wet 
field and the goal posts seemed 
to stand In the Tritons way. 

The only score of the game 
came as a nuke when a ball, 
coming back to goalie Jim Har-
rington, was just out of reach. \ 
It bounced ott the top cross bar 
and an irvine forward headed 
the ball Into the goal. 

UCSD played catch- up the rest 
of the game, but just couldn't 
score, and UCSD was upset in 
thetr first game 1-0. 

The Tritons played their sec-
ond game Friday, the 18th against 
UC RiverSide, who, earlier inthe 
season, beat UCSD 10-3. Triton 
do mination of the field continued, 
and the aggressive play of the 
offense combined with tough de-
fensive work to jar Riverside 
from their slow, deliberate , 
overcon1ldent style of play. 

But again, the Tritons were 
beset by troubles from all direc-
tions: the bright sunshine, a pack 
of dogs roamlng the field, slip-
pery tooting, and an above ground 
playing field, which, when the 
ball was kicked over the fence, 
slowed down the UCSD fast style 
of play. 

Rive r s ide scored first whlln 
Jim Harrington batted down a 
shot, the ball dribbled out of 
reach, and a Riverside forward 
pushed the ball in. 

UCR scored their second goal 
late in the game and despite 
UCSD's Improved passing, they 
lost their second game 2-1. Karate Tournament

teams have perfect 2-0 records

In the "A" league, the BOI 
Bombers have won both of their 
games with impressive play. The 
Plastic Machine, also 2-0, has 
won its two games through for-
feits. Intramural Director Andy 
Sklef disappointed at tbe number 
of f~rfeits so far, said, "They 
must be a mighty fear some buncb 
if no one has even showed up to

The UCSD cross country team 
finished second In a trl-meet 
held here against UC Riverside 
and Pasadena College last Satur-
day. 

UC Riverside runners finished 
first, second, third, fltth, and 
sixth for an impressive 17 point 
total to win the meet. 

UCSD, with fourth, seventh, 
ninth, tenth and ele venth place 
finishes, beat Pasadena 41-85 
to revenge a stinging loss suf-
fered last year up at Pasadena. 

Triton runner Jay Segalflnlsh-
ed the 4.6 mile Triton course in 
28:00 for a new UCSD course 
record, eclipsing the 28:06 mark 
set by Doug Peckham In 1967. 
To indicate Riverside's strength, 
however, Segal finished fourth In 
setting this record. Lampson of 
Riverside won the meet with an 
outstanding 26:59 time. 

Jay Gillette, sophomore, was 
elected captain of the Triton 
team after the meet. 

Freshman Joe Gonzales, anew 
addition to the team, finished 
third on the Triton squad with a 
creditable 29: 15. 

The loss of Clark Rosen (fourth 
place finisher In the last home 
meet) to mononucleosis and 
Charles Lindsey (third place fin-
isher in the last home meet) to 
academic commitments wUl 
make tile road tougher In the 
weeks to come. 

Coach Bob Wilson said, "The 
emphasis In practice will be on 
reducing the time Interval be-
tween our tlrst and fifth men, to 
Improve our scoring punch." 

The next meet will be the 
Chapman Invitational, tomorrow 
at 11 a.m. up at Chapman College. 

The Purple Gophers, the Mete-
or Gaiters and the Dun Geeps 
are "B" league teams with 2-0 
records. The Purple Gophers, 
defending Intramural champions, 
w1l1 have to reckon with the fine 
performances of the Baitprs and 
Geeps. 

The Greeks, with two solid 
victories after making up a for-
feit, are the top team In the "~"

however, with two forfeit vIc-
tories, is expected to give th 
Greeks some problems. 

their flag when marching past 
the reviewing stand; and 2. the 
protest gesture by Tommie Smith 
and John Carlos at the awards 
ceremony. 

The flag controversy is inter-
esting because both sides seem 
to have legitimate arguments. 
One faction claims the U.S. should 
dip their nag to show respect 
to the International Olympic 
Committee (rOC) and by not dip-
ping the flag, we snubbed the 
other countries that did. 

The other faction claims we 
should be proud of our flag by 
not dipping It and, atter all, 
there Is a U.S. statute speci-
fically prohibiting the dipping of 
our flag. 

I stand in the middle, for while 
I am proud of our flag, 1 think 
no country should dip thelr nag 
at all. There is no reason for 
it, and there are other cere-
monies during the Olympics that 
show respect to Mr. Avery Brun-
dage (head of the JOC) and the 
Olympic Committee . 

The Car los-Smith case is much 
more complicated. They are 
accused of showing disrespect 
to our flag, and symbolically 
to the U.S., and more important-
ly, bringing politics into the 
games which are traditionally 
non-political. The IOC (lemanded 
an Immediate apology and remo-
val of Carlos and Smith from 
the team and from the country, 
which the United States Olympic 
Committee did. 

All of these proceedings are 
ludicrous, hypocritical, and 
close-minded. First, the IOC 
cannot, by any means, keep pol-
itics out of the Olympics. I 
hate to be the one to tell Mr. 
Brundage, but our world prob-
lems are not solved to where 
athletes of 100 countries can 
take off and have games, obli-
vious of all the world's prob-
lems . The Committee is hypo-
critical, they banned South Afri-
ca from participation, and that 
certainly was a polltical dec1-
15ion. 

How many mlllions of people 
watched the many fine black ath-
letes compete with the comment, 
"Them niggers sure can run· ? 
And how many of these same 
people will refer to Smith as 
"boy· and Carlos as "he y you· 
when meeting them on Anystreet, 
U.S.A. 

All in all, it's really disgust-
ing. Carlos and Smith were right 
to take It upon themselves to 
call attention to the problem 
of racism in this country. And 
to any San Diegan who cries 

~communist", may I remind you 
of Tommie Smith's remark that 
he was proud to be black, and 
also proud to win a gold medal 
for the U.S. and give pride to 
his people in Watts, Harlem, 
Selma or wherever they may 
be. That is about as American 
as you'll ever get. 

The only question still in my 
mind is whether or not the U.S. 
should have pulled out of the 
games, protesting the roc's ru-
ling. It certainly is very nice, 
and important, to compete in the 
Olympic Games. But shouldn't 
we face our problems first? 

This doesn't necessarily mean 
pulling out of the games, but a 
show of support 01 Smith and 
Carlos would prove to citizens 
of the U.S. that athletes of our 
country, both black and white, 
realize that the problem of 
racism exists In this country. 

As Mr. Carlos commented 
when asked why he had bowed 
his head during the playing of 
"The Star Spangled Banner,· it's 
hard to be proud in a country 
like ours where such bruf1'l.l ra-
cism exists. I only hope they 
opened some eyes around the 
U.S. to our problems. II not, 
it would all be in vain.

sistance to continue college

Most of the new awards will be 
a vailable to high school seniors 
but the number available for 
currently enrolled college stu-
dents who are not already in the 
state Scholarship Program has 
been increased by recent legis-
lation. 

State Scholarships are avail-
able for use at any accredited 
four-year college in California. 
The awards range from $300 to 
$2,000 at independent colleges, 
$300 at the University of Calif-
ornia, and are in the amount of 
fees charged to students at the 
California state Colleges (ap-
proximately $120). 

In addition, students planning 
to attend junior college may have 
their grants held in reserve for 
them until such time as they at-
tend a four-year college . 

Appl1cations are available in 
the Office of Financial Aid or 
directly from the State Scholar-
ship and Loan Commission, 520 ' 
Capitol Mall, Sacramento, Cali-
fornia, 95814. Applications must 
be filed with the State Scholar-
ship Commission by midnight, 

The Centennial Caravan, 
scheduled to visit San Diego on 
October 23-27 at the Community 
Concourse, is a 12,000 square 
foot display consisting of 73 
seven-foot high panels, and nine 
display wagons. It will depict in 
text, photography and three di-
mensional materials the Univer-
sity's contributions in such fields 
as science, food, health, urban 
planning, pollution, criminology, 
traffic safety, transportation and 
education. 

At the entrance to the Cen-
tennial Caravan, a spiral-shaped 
structure, visitors willflrst view 
a six-minute film, "What is a 
University?" , narrated by Uni-
versity alumnus, Gregory Peck. 
As the visitor proceeds through 
the widening spiral, the panels 
become brighter in color, signi-
fying the growth and enlighten-
ment of the University. 

The last feature will be a dis-
play of models and prototypes of 
University developed equipment, 
including an electro-magnetic 
submarine, the original cyclotron 
which led to the development of 
atomic energy, a flying saucer, 
criminology investigative equip-
ment, teaching machines and 
many others.
