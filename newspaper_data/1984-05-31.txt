The American Red Cross announced 

that it will be implementing a planned 
national effort to increase the supply of 
tissue and organs to meet increasing 
human needs. The primary thrust of the 
program will be on tissue banking -
corneas, skin and bone marrow, with 
the organization moving into organ 
banking in the future. Richard F. 
Schubert, President of the American Red 
Cross, explained that the organization 
embarked on its tissue banking effort to 
ensure that "patient needs are met." 
Schubert also announced that the 
organization will begin evaluating a test 
for the possible presence of Acquired 
Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in 
donated blood. Schubert said the blood 
test for the AIDS-related virus, called 
HTLV-3, will be studied within the next 
few weeks at the Red Cross headquarters 
laboratories in Washington, DC. 
"These stUdies are essential for ensuring 
that the test is accura te and readily 
adaptable for routine identification of 
blood that might carry the AIDS-related 
virus," Schubert said.

Commencement is scheduled to begin 
at 11 am Sunday, June 3, on the lawn 
west of the Biomedical Library, and is 
open to the public, Henderson's 
distinguished reputation is based largely 
on his leadership role in the worldwide 
eradication of smallpox. This year's

"The Greenhouse Effect," which 

deals with the significance of increasing 
caroon dioxide in the atmosphere, will 
be discussed by Prof. William A 
Nierenberg, director of The Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography, during a 
free public lecture on Friday at 7:30 pm. 
The lecture will be held in Scripps' 
Sumner Auditorium, and foHowing it, me

new museum exhibit on atmospheric 
caroon dioxide (C02) buildup. 
AtmospheriC scientists have recognized 
the potential hazards of a greenhouse 
effect resulting from temperature 
increases caused by the accumulation of 
C02 in the atmosphere. Its end result 
could drastically alter the earth's climate

The ford Motor Company wants to 

help you get a new car. At least that's 
what it announced last week about a 
new special purchase plan for 
graduating college seniors and graduate 
students. The plan consists of a 
certificate for a $400 purchase allowance 
when a purchase is made from an 
authorized Ford dealer, and a certificate 
for Ford Credit financing which 
includes pre-approved credit. The 
eligible vehicles for the program are 
those that are most appealing to the 
lifestyles of new graduates - 1984 
models of Escort, EXP, Ranger, Bronco 
II, Mustang, Tempo and Thunderbird. 
Letters are being mailed to hom~ of 
more than 500,000 students from 449 
colleges and universities. Since only 
students with the purchase allowance 
and finance plan certificates in their 
names are eligible, those who were not 
included in the initial mailing should 
contact their local Ford dealer for 
information on how to qualify. 

"When the Women's Resource Board came to us and asked tor money for a' -
rape prevention program, 1 had to say 'no' - we don't have enough money in 
the budget," said Appointments and Evaluations Commissioner john Trumpler. 
"And then people fike the ASIa (Associated Students Internship Orpnlzation) 
have the gall to come in and ask for seven dollars per hour in stipends and a ten 
percent COSt of living raise!" 

The AS budget hearin~ begin tonight, and already tempers are Oaring and 
sides are being drawn over financial and ethical issues. The most volatile issue 
thus far is the ASIa budget. ASIa has requested funding of $15,000, but the 
Finance Committee found it fit to allocate only $7,081 . The Finance 
Committee's allocation, which is only a recommendation, cuts out the stipends 
for four directorships. The director of development, the director of fund raising, 
a national director and a San Diego regional director were aD cut out, leaving 
only an executive and a summer position with funding. If the AS were to 
approve of the budget recommended by the Finance Committee, the $7,081 
figure would be the lowest the ASIa has ever received since its first year of 
operation. 

"Personally, I think it was a bad recommendation," said AS Vice President 
and Finance Committee Chairperson Mal}' Rose Alexander. "People in the . 
Finance Committee are already reconsidering their votes. The main reason 
ASIa did not get a lot of funding was that no representative came to give a 
presentation. I knew a little abollt the office, so I tried to defend their budget 
request as best I could. I think tonight when they give their fuR presentation, 
people ~ll realiz~ that the ASIa deserv.e..s. ~re money." 

Trumpler believes that no stUdent organization has the right to ask for 
stipends, especially an organization that already has a similar program funded 
by the University. "No student organization makes any money - nobody 
makes a dime," said Trumpler. "They say nobody will do the job. In Santa 
Barbara they do the internship program for free, and they place more people in 
positions. If there is not enough support for it here, then I think it says 
something about the program and its perceived need on campus." 

After the ASIa budget is debated tonight, the AS will spend the rest of the 
night and tomorrow night on the remaining budgets. In hammering out a 
budget, the Council will ay to stay within the parameters of the executive buciaet 
submitted by President Boroditsky and within the recommendations of the 
Finance Committee. On most of the other recommendations, both budgets 
have been fairly consistent with each other's assessments. The Committee for 
World Democracy (which sponsors the free film series) has In past years had to 
fight for evety dollar, but this year will apparently receive a sum in the 
neighborhood of 512,000. The Sun God festival, which was very successful in 
its Tirst year, will be back next year with a budget of $IQ,OOO. The media 
allocation, which in the past has been a subject of hot debate from both the right 
and the left, was penciled in by Boroditsky for 525,000, while the finance 
Committee was even more liberal with a recommendation that the tabloids get 
funding of 529,000. The allocation in the presidential budget for campus radio 
station KSDT was 515,000, while the Finance Committee proposed $19,786. 

The total of the allocations, which are funded by the Activity Fee, is oVer 
$180,000. 

1968 .. , 
Several students have become 

disillusioned with the whole idea of 
student government on campus and 
have instituted a curious campaign to 
resolve their grievances in the form of 
an ASUCSD Constitutional amendment. 
The proposal states that the AS Senate 
may charge compulsory fees at any rate 
or at any time. This cleVer move to 
make the AS fee payment voluntary has 
striking consequences including this: if 
more than 1/3 but less than 1/2 of the 
students vote against the amendment, 
for whatever reasons, the petitioners' 
purpose will be fulfilled : the AS would 
no longer be able to levy Associated 
Student Fees.

Sessions for victims 
of eating disorders 
By YEN TAYLOR 

Nationally, 30% of all college women 
suffer from some sort of eating disorders 
which can lead to long-tcnn damage 
and even death. Twelve percent of these 
victims are severely afflicted, "I have no 
reason to believe that the number of 
victims at UCSD is not comparable to 
these figures," said Chris Pollero, a 
trained peer counselor of the Recovery 
Eating Disorder (RED) group on 
campus. 

Though it is not possible to obtain an 
exact number of the eating disorder 
victims at UCSD, "the amount of interest 
that our program has received in such a 
shon time shows that it's a major 
problem on this campus: said Pollero. 

RED was established last year by the 
Psychological Services to provide 
support, information and counseling for 
eating disorder victims and their 
friends. The program is divided into 
two groups: RED I and RED D. 

RED I consists of women who are still 
suffering from some form of eating 
disorder. These women belong to either 
a closed or open membership group. 
The former is initiated at the beginning 
of fall quarter and does not accept new 
members once the group is esablished. 
The purpose of having a closed 
membership is to maintain continuiry 
and to provide a familiar setting for the 
members. 

"It's an ideal setting. There's a certain 
!ligma associated with eating disorder. 
Therefore, coming out and talking about 
it is really hard for a person. Having a 
familiar setting where they know who is 
going to be there makes it easier for 
them to talk about it," said Pollero. 

On the other hand, the open 
membership group welcomes new 
members to aUow them to begin 
receiving support at the earliest possible 
opportunity. This open session meets 
every Friday moming from 8:30 to 10 in 
the Warren College Provost Conference 
Room. Accprding to Pollero, the closed 
membership group has eight members 
and the open membership group has an 
average of six to eight attendants every 
Friday. 

In contrast-to RED I, RED n is made 
up of women who have recovered from 
their eating disorder through private 
therapy, professional counseling or the 
RED I program. These women act as 
peer counselors for drop-in centers, and 
[wo of them, Anne Scott and Chris 
Ponero, assist Psychologist Beverly HaJju 
in running the RED I program. 

"These women say 'Hey! We can 
help, we have the ability to help others 
because we've been through it: 
Sometimes, the psychologists are at a 
disadvantage because they haven't been 
there," commented Pollero. These 
women follow the Alcoholics 
Anonymous model: the best way to help 

oneself is to help others," Pollero 
continued. 

RED U also leads a weekly informative 
discussion at the Health Center on 
Mondays at 2. This informal session 
strives to inform olhers of the problem 
of eating disorder on campus and to 
give counseling to friends of the victim 
on how to approach her. In addition, 
this selling allows persons with eating 
disorders to learn more about the 
support services on campus without 
having to identify themselves. 

Eating disorders disrupt every asP.fct 
of a pe~n's life and make it virtually 
impossible to hold a job, attend school 
or sustain relationships. Though the 
majority of the victims of eating 
disorders are women, males can also be 
affected. According to a stUdy 
conducted by the American Psychology 
AsSOCiation, the mortality rate is 20%. 
Eating disorders manifest in these 
following diseases: 

Anorexia nervosa (the so-called 
starvation disease) is an obsessive 
pursuit of thinness. Some of the 
symptoms for anorexia include: refusal 
to eat normally or at all; preoccupation 
with calorie counting and food; 
weighing oneself constantly; frequent 
strenuous exercise; loss of 25% or more 
of body weight, usually in a short time; 
drastic physical changes; cessation of 
menstruation. ScientificaIly, anorectics 
lack the body fat necessary to produce 
nonnal menstrual cycles. Once weight is 
gained, the monthly flow usually returns. 
However, "it's possible that some who 
are anorectic for extended periods 
during puberty may never have a period 
or bear children" (Globe, May 1981). 

As anorexia continues, more than 
50% of the victims become 
"binge/purgers." They consume a 
tremendous amount of food and then 
force themselves to get rid of it through 
vomiting or taking laxatives. This phase 
of anorexia is known as bulimia. Some 
of the signs for bulimia include frequent 
vomiting, secretive behavior, puffiness of 
the face, fatigue and depression. 

The third form of eating disorder is 
bulimarexia in which the victim is both 
an anorectic and a bulimic. 

According to PoDero, the members of 
RED n are former victims of both 
anorexia and bulimia. HoW\:ver, in RED 
I, the group is primarily bulimics. "This 
is due to the fact that by the time a 
person is diagnosed as anorectic, she 
needs more intensive therapy than we 
could offer," said Pollero. Because 
anorectics lack nutrients, they are 
unable to think clearly. Their weight 
needs to be brought back up before they 
can have a realistic perception of the 
world. This process reqUires intensive 
cOWlseling and quite often, 
hospitalization. The earlier the malady is

detected, the greater the chance for 
recovery." 

Pollero is herself a recovered 
anorectic and bulimic. She became 
anorectic three years ago when she was 
a freshman at Chico State College. "For 
[WO months, I ate nothing but popcorn 
and bouillon," said Pollero. "No butter 
and salt on the popcorn either: she 
added with a smile. Pollero recalled that 
she became an anorectic because she 
was looking for control of her life. 
"There were a lot of things I felt I 
couldn't comrol. The only thing I could 
comrol was my eating and my weight." 
said Pollero. Some anorectics believe 
that if their eating is in comrol, 
everything else is also in control. 

"When I went home that summer, my 
parents were alarmed at how much 
weiWu I had lost. I had been dieting the 
whOle semester," recalled Pollero. Her 
parents suggested that she start 
counseling because they noticed a 
personality change in her. "Normally, I 
was an outgOing person, but I became 
introverted. Starting counseling so early 

was one of the most important factors 
in my recovery," said Pollero. 

However, during that summer, Poliero 
also became a bulimic. "I rediscovered 
food . So I would go through the process 
of binging and then purging because I 
didn't want to gain the weight back." 

When Pollero went back to Chico for 
her second year, she also sought 
counseling there. "It became worse. My 
parents were no longer there to watch 
me. I averaged up to 20 laxatives a day," 
said Pollero. Though she was regularly 
attending therapy, she didn't make 
much progress. 

Pollero began he~ recovery when she_ 
came home that summer and started 
seeing therapist Dori Winchell in 
Encinitas: "She is one of the main 
reasons why I became well." 

Pollero has been involved with the 
RED D program since its conception last 
fall quarter. She commented on her 
involvement: "I felt that I had something 
to offer because I can empathize with 
those who are going through it now." 

Student employee 
rights bill fails 
By JACKIE AFFONSO 
Sacrammto Comspondmt 

Even three tries were not enough for 
a student employee rights bill which 
failed in the Assembly Public Employees 
and Retirement Committee hearing late 
Wednesday. 

Assembly Bill 3251 , which had be~n 
scheduled for hearings [Wice before , 
would have granted UC student 
employees the same collective 
bargaining rights as non-student 
employees. Its final defeat was due to a 
lack of votes. 

No discussion followed the bill's 
introduction by its author, Assemblyman 
Tom Bates (D-Berkeley). 

"This bill allows students at the 
University of California to be treated as 
other employees at the University of 
California;· he told committee members. 

Initiator of the bill , the Association of 
Graduate Student Employees at UC 
Berkeley, was both "disappointed" yet 
optimistic the measure would be re-
introduced. 

'·We're disappOinted, we thought we 
had the support of all the [committee] 
Democrats .. .. There's a possibility we 
may introduce the bill in another form ," 
member of the AGSE Executive Board 
Allen Cheadle said. 

While AGSE believed it had the 
support of Democratic 
Assemblymembers Teresa Hughes and 
Gloria Molina , both from Los Angeles, 
they didn't show up in time for the 
vote. Assemblyman Louis Papan (D-Daly 
City), also considered a supporter of the 
bill, did not vote . 

Legislative Consultant to Bates Dion 
Aroner said although the votes from the 
committee "aren't there to pass the bill." 
Bates has not yet given up. Aroner said 

Bates is negotiating a way to reintroduce 
the bill in the Senate with a new author. 

The primary function of the Bates bill 
is to amend the existing Higher 
Education Employer-Employee Relations 
Act, thereby allOwing all students to join 
and be represented by existing unions 
during negotiations with \)niversity 
administration. 

The University is opposed to the bill. 
UC Director of State and Governmental 
Relations Steve Arditti said those 
students whose employment is not 
related to their academic work, such as 
cafeteria workers, can participate in 
collective bargaining, but those whose 
work is academically related are not 
eligible. 

Allowing those students, such as 
teaching and research assistants, to be 
unionized would cause "adversarial 
relationships between students and 
faculty members," he said. 

Arditti said students' employment 
concerns can be met by the 
administration through other means 
unrelated to the collective bargaining 
process. 

"We are not aware of any problems 
which require this change in the law in 
order to be resolved," he said. 

AGSE, however, states the University 
makes decisions affecting student 
employees without their knowledge or 
input. 

By special permiSSion from the 
Assembly Rules Committee, Bates had 
managed to schedule hearings on the 
bill after its initial defeat last month and 
then a third time after he failed to 
appear at the second hearing.

A letter to Tucker 
As a srudent representative, I 

find it necessary to generate this 
letter in order to "set the record 
SUllight" regarding the University 
Center Referendum. 

The offiCially printed 
referendum return shows that: 

1) 1390, 54.4% vOted "YES" 
1163, 46.6% voted "NO" 

2) 'lfJ67 students submitted 
ballots in this referendum. 

My arithmetic finds that 1390 
+ 1163 - 2553. Yet the official 
number of voting srudents is 
2667, a discrepancy of 114 
students. In such a close 
referendum as this, stuffing the 
ballot box with blank baBots is 
highly suspect since a minimum 
percentage turnout was required. 
I insist that the "official" number 
of baBots submitted be changed 
to read 2553. This will change 
the percentage of recorded 
srudent voters, yet the true 
figure will stilJ remain above 
20%. 

I have researched the official 
UC San Diego Campus 
Regulations Applying to Campus 
Activities, Organizations and 
Students as approved August 17, 
1981. Article 62.00 reads: 
"Compulsory fees may be 
established only following an 
election in which two-thirds of a 
voting pool, as specified prior to 
the election in campus 
regulations, vote in favor of 
compulsory fees. 

for the purpose of the 
regulations, the "voting pool" is 
defined as 25% of the AS fee-
paying undergraduates registered 
for the quarter during which the 
election is held; the "voting pool" 
for the GSC is also 25% of the 
graduate students currently 
registered. 

Thus the UCSD policy as of 
August 17, 1981 clearly states 
that 25% of the undergraduate 
population and also 25% of the 
graduate srudent population here 
at UCSD must voce to establish a 
mandatory Student Center fee. 
As for the argument that the 
Student Center Fee has already 
been established, I must reply 
that any increase in the Student 
Center Fee which triples the 
present fee is no mere addition 
but indeed is actualy a new 
establishment of the fee. 

Did 25% of the graduate 
students vote? Also, policy states 
that two-thirds of the voting pool 
must approve such fee 
establishments. 

In order for the poiicy to be 
changed, Article 12.00 states that 
a) the chancellor must "publish 
and make widely awilable, free 
of charge, campus regulatiOns 
consistent with these policies"; 
b) the ChanceUor "shall consult 
with students, including student 
flvernments where they exist, 
faculty, and staff in the 
development and modification of 
campus regulations"; and c) "All 
proposed campus regulations, 
including modifications, shall be 
submitted to the President for 
review for consistency with these 
general policies prior to 
adoption." 

Since the Chancellor did not 
modify the policy for this 
referendum under the procedure 
Article 12.11, the existing policy 
is necessarily the binding one. 

In order to become even more 
clear about this issue, let us 

examine the last referendum 
comparable to this one. 

A letter sent to then 
Chancellor William McBroy from 
'Bert Kobayashi, chair of the 
Student Recreational facilities 
Commiaee, contains the 
following: "The requirement for a 
referendum on fees calls for a 
67% affirmative vote to pass. The 
other condition imposed on this 
vote was a 25% voter turnout." 

Is the information in this lener 
inaccurate? If so, did the 
chancellor ever refute it? Has the 
policy been changed? Not 
acccording to the official version 
of UCSD Policies and Regulation. 

Also, it has come to my 
attention that certain blatantly 
undemocratic acts occurred at 
the polls. These incidents will 
undoubtedly be documented in 
the campus newspapers, and 
their accuracy has yet to be 
verified. 

In light of the facts above, I 
find it necessary to insist that 
you declare the fee increase 
"Unapproved" by this 
referendum. Any move otherwise 
is a blatant aaempt at thwarting 
the rules which this campus 
abides by and is a threat to 
student rights. 

As the representative of the 
Co-ops, I must say that we were 
supporting of this referendum 
with the understanding that 
students will maintain the 
decisive control in the outcome 
of this process. You have built 
and fought for a new trust to be 
built among students and 
administrators. To suggest now 
that the referendum was an 
approval of the fee increase is to 
kick salt into an old sore. 

I cannot and will not support 
any process which blatantly 
overrides srudent rights. The 
students have the right to veto 
the University Center project as 
much as they have the right to 
support it with their money. 
Such a close vote as this 
referendum is a positive sr.ep in 
this process but it is definitely 
not a sign of solid student 
support, nor is it a 1egal means 
for instituting a $25 per quarter 
increase. The voces of 1390 
students cannot decide such a 
thing for 12.319 studentS. 

I and many other students 
have acted in Bood faith. The 
rules and regulations must be 
followed strictly to maintain this 
faith. Student rights are minimal, 
at best, on this campus and we 
shaD not tolerate any 
infringement of these rights. 

I recommend that we continue 
this plannina process and hold a 
new -referenclum next year. I also 
deem it necessary to require that 
the next referendum 

1) give the students concrete 
proposals to vote on; 

2) be c\early organized such 
that it is clear what the policy is 
for approval of a fee increase; 

3) that more student input be 
solicited on the wording of the 
~stion; 

i) timing of the referendum 
question be more carefully 
considered; and 

5) a democratic forum for the 
presentation of aU student 
opinions be provided from the 
Start. 

Since the Student Center 
Board held this referendum. the 

Board must now make a 
recommendation to you and the 
vice chancellor regarding its 
outcome. I urge both of you to 
maintain a stance of integrity by 
strictly observing the policy of 
this campus. Our goal in sight 
must not be used as a 
justification to sidestep due 
process. Since our vision is of a 
unified campus with a strong 
sense of community, every step 
we take must be a step towards 
funhered trust and be a 
stimulant for increased student 
participation. 

The students have spoken 
loudly in the past two weeks. We 
must respond decisively to the 
votes on both sides and to the 
criticisms voiced about the 
process. 

Sincerely submitIM,

Mr. Canole's "Riding Beyond 

One's Umit" was an intriguing 
p'iece of fiction, especially 
concerning the capabilities of his 
bike. Isn't that 105 bhp a bit 
optimistic for a bone-stock 750cc 
engine, when aB-out Daytona 
versions of the same engine are 
pumping out just 20 more horse 
than you claim yours is? Why, 
Honda's CBX, a 1036cc, six-
cylinder beast, "only" puts-oUt 
103 ponies. 

I really hate to be the one to 
ask, but have you had your 
speedometer calibrated lately? 
The stock rear sprocket your 
bike sports gives the VF750f a 
top speed of 133 mph at 10,500 
rpm, or 139 at your 11,000 rpm. 

Please, Mr. Canole, the 
Interceptor is an outstanding 
motorcycle straight from the 
factory, so don't feel the need to 
up its specs jUst to make a good 
story. Lowers and a monotone 
paint job may look great, but 
they can't take the place of a re-
worked engine.

I am disgusted that some 
nitwit of a student, wishing to 
express his sub-vocal level of 
inteUigence, has vandalized the 
latest addition to the Stuart 
CoUection. All the art classes that 
this University offers, aD the 
media of expression available, 
and some frustrated soul decides 
to express himself by damaging 
the work of another, insulting 
the artist and all an appreciators. 

While there may be varied 
opinions of the Stuart CoUection, 
it does not give anyone the right 
to destroy an artWork because he 
or she does not like it. 

Sin~-:,t Robert Eric 
Ediaor: 

I was pleased to read in the 
May 29 issue of The Guardian 
that the San Diego City Planning 
Commission has approved the 
proposed B1ackhorse Farms 
project. What worries me now is 
that the prospect of the City 
Council bending under pressure 
of the monied personal interests 
of the La Jolla farms residents 
and not approving the project. 

It seems that cries of increased 
parking congestion and foot 
traffic stem from the La Jolla 
Farms residents' interest in 
keeping the srudent and faculty 

of UCSD on their proper side of 
Torrey Pines Road. Although the 
project will remove some parking 
spaces, with proper planning 
more parking area is and will be 
created. Students and faculty may 
continue parking as at present 
and simply walk to the new 
center. Granted, foot traffic will 
increase, but what right do the 
La jolla Farms residents have to 
say how many people may walk 
past their house? 

The adwntage of retail stores 
and restaurants within walking 
distance to UCSD is obvious to 
on-campus dwellers without 
vehicles. for those with cars, the 
idea of traveling to University 
Towne Cenrre or La Jolla Village 
Square for lunch only to return to 
search for a parking place is not 
too appealing. 

I see the proposed townhouses 
as an excellent opportunity to 
bring off-campus srudents closer 
than Del Mar or University City 

. and adding some much needed 
social vitality to UCSD. Because 
the new living space will bring 
more neighbors to present La 
Jolla farms residents I suppose 
they see this as a further 
infrin$ement upon their 
unspoken right to keep the 
University students in their 
place. 

Although the B1ackhorse farms 
project may slightly disrupt the 
'peaceful bliss of the La Jolla 
farms residents, it will greatly 
benefit thousands of UCSD 
students and faculty. What is 
more important, to serve the few 
or the many, is now left to the 
decision of the San Diego 
Council. 

Sincerely.

Please accept the following 

advice concerning your editorial 
in the May 29 issue of the 
Guardian . 1) Fifty commas in a 
nine paragraph essay is 
excessive. Six commas in a 
single sentence is a sign of 
laziness and disorganized 
moUJdu. 2) lntertia is more 
sensibly overcome than it is 
halr.ed. Use your dictiolWf. 3) I 
agree that "people (often I have a

It has recendy come to the 

attention of the Black Students 
Union that Dr. David L. lewis of 
the Department of History will 
not be returning to UCSD. So 
once again there is an awilable 
position within the Department 
of History for a professor of Afro-
American history. 

Three years ago the students 
of this campUs demonstrated 
their commitment to ensuring 
that this position be filled by a 
faculty member who not only 
fulfills the University 
requirements of academic 
scholarship, but in addition will 
serve as a positive role model for 
the UCSD Black student 
community. 

Chancellor Atkinson and the 
Department of HiStory should be 
well advised that although the

I have three simple comments to 

make: 

and modem memory 
1) To the fihhy slime that set the fire 
alarm off: Look up dead meat in my 
dictionary - there's a picture of your 
pureed and burning genitals. 

2) To the administration: I suggest 
that you publicize a new policy 
concerning fa1se fire alarms that 
contains, as a minimum, the following: 

a. A $500 reward for information 
leading to judicial action against the 
perpeaatot{s); 

b. A 52000 administrative fine 
against the account of the perpetratot{s), 
expulsion from University Housing. 
suspension from the University for one 
quarter, and judicial prosecution. 

3) To the police: I cannot understand 
the need for a 4O-minute delay before 
aUowing students to return to their 
rooms. It seems to me that a search of 
the rooms should easily be 
accomplished in no more than ten 
minutes with the help of the ten plus 
RA's and other staff. Also, if the Resident 
Dean can come to the conclusion that 
no fire exists, 1 feel perfectly safe in 
aBowing that person to stOp the 
unnecessary ewcuation.

There Is no issue more important, say 

one-third of us here at UCSD. 
The Nuclear Issues Survey was · 

conceived by me and conducted with 
the help of the Students for the 
Prevention of Nuclear War and with 
much-appreciated advice from a 
psychology professor (who asked not to 
be named). Results show that people are 
worried about the nuclear situation: 
Twenty-one percent said they worry at 
least once a week about nuclear war, 
and 32% worry a few times a month. 
However, people are woefully 
uninformed on exacto/ what they're 
concerned about. This is very counter-
productive. If people are just worried 
about some vague threat, it is easy for 
them to feel removed from it and to 
believe they cannot do anything about 
it; but when people find out the facts, 
the specifics of me problem, then the 
problem becomes more real to them: 
They can get really scared, really angry, 
and, most important, they can see what 
they have to do to help solve the 
problem. 

An example of this distancing was 
shown on the question of the nuclear

freeze (an agreement to halt the 
development of nuclear weapons). 
Seventy-three percent of the 
respondents support it (the national 
level of suppOrt is 80%), but 56% agreed 
with the statement that Russian 
compliance is not verifiable, and 11 % 
left the question blank or wrote in "don't 
know." The fact is that we have the 
"three 5's" for verification: satenites that 
are so sensitive they can read a license 
plate in Moscow, seismic detectors that 
can easily sense a nuclear explosion test 
and that old standby, spying. People 
found it easy to agree with the freeze , 
but they do not take the next logical 
step: finding out about why and how it 
would happen. We could be just as sure 
the Russians were not building bombs 
as we now are sure they are. A small 
missile could be hidden in a truck, but 
where would they hide the factory that 
builds it and the laboratory that 
develops it? 

There were definite differences in 
response between males and females. 
Nearly three times as many men said 
they never worry about nuclear war 
(15%, as compared to 5.7% of females). 

Four times as many women admitted to 
thinking of it daily (8%, to 2% of 
males). Of the women, 48% said they 
could think of no issue more important, 
but about 80% of the men could: "my 
life as I lead it," "whether or not I will 
be gainfully employed," "general 
harmony among countries: "communist 
expansionism: "getting Ronald Reagan 
out of the White House: -futile military 
expenditures," "people not hearing 
about salwtion through Jesus Christ." 
"world hunger" and "entropy." It is easy 
to see that most of these relate right 
back to the nuclear issue. 

The freeze is supponed by 69% of 
the males, but the percentage of females 
supporting it - 83% - was actually 
higher than the national level. Thirty-
one percent of the women admitted 
having had a dream or nightmare about 
nuclear war, compared to 25% of the 
men. Still, that is a lot of people having 
bad dreams about something that can 
be stopped. 

There were also differences between 
humanities and hard-science students, 
which paralleled the male/ female results:

The nuclear war and modem memoty 
continued from page 5 
More humanities students had the 
nightmare (37.5%, to only 23% 'of 
science students); 83% of humanities 
students supponed the freeze , against 
68% of science maJors . Humanities 
students' responses to the question 
"How often have you worried about 
nuclear warT' were heavily weighted 
towards greater frequency (for example, 
11 % of science majors said they "ever 
worry, about three times as many as 
among humanities majors, and 1% 
worry daily, compared to 12.5% of 
humanities students). Both groups were 
just as unsure of the factual 
"agree/ disagree" questions as everyone 
else was. Answers tended to be about 
evenly divided between agree and 
disagree, but humanities students 
admitted they didn't know the answers 

much more readily than science 
students did (about 25% gave up on 
each factual question , compared to 
about 6% of science students, who were 
no more likely to actually know the right 
answer) . 

Only 36% of the total agreed that the 
US has stated its wiUingness to be the 
first to use nuclear weapons. The rest 
either did not know or thought the 
opposite. The fact is that the US 
officially "reserves the right to use any 
and all means to protect her interests." 
The use of nuclear weapons has been 
considered several times and by several 
presidents: Vitenam and the Persian 
Gulf are just two examples. 

The worst ignorance was on' the 
economic front. Although the economy 
was one of those issues people found 
more imponant than nuclear war (26%

of freshmen said thiS), when asked to 
estimate what percent of each tax dollar 
goes to "defense," nearly 70% guessed 
low or did not know at all. The correct 
figure is about 50%. Some people 
guessed as low as 2% and 5%. 
Economics majors, surprisingly, were 
just as ignorant as the general 
population, of whom 12% guessed 15% 
of each dollar or less went to weaponry. 

People say they are more concerned 
about getting a job, but they do not 
realize the job market is actually being 
constricted by this gross military 
spending that puts no goods into the 
marketplace . It produces billions of 
dollars WOM of goods that cannot be 
returned to the economy: they sit, 
unusable, in our arsenals . Military 
spending creates over a million fewer 
jobs than could be created if the same 
amount were to be diverted into the 
civilian economy. 

The most frightening ignorance came 
in response to this statement: '''False 
alarms: in which the air defense 
command computer miStakenly signals a 
Soviet attack, happen very frequendy." 
Thirry-five percent agreed, although 
some scratched out the word ·"very." 
Forry-five percent disagreed, and 14% 
had no idea. In truth, according to a 
Congressional repon instigated by 
Senator Han, in which a general from 
NORAD was asked about the operations 
of the SAC command center, the 
flashing red light and siren went off not 
yearly, or monthly, or even weekly. In 
the 13 months prior to the investigation 
it had gone off 1,800 times . 

This is an average of three or four 
times daily. Each time, those men have 
to decide whether it is the real thing -
whether to launch the missiles. Usually 
the system fault is identified or the flock 
of birds is identified, but here are some 
recent near-misses. 

November 9, 1979: A war games tape 
was fed into a computer and 
aCcidentally transmitted to Air Force 
bases. Three squadrons of planes armed 
with nuclear weapons took off. It took 
20 minutes to find the PresideD! (he 
was to be notified at the seventh 
minute). If in 20 minutes it had not 
been stopped, we would not be here 
right now. 

Nineteen-eighty: A Titan missile in 
Arkansas aCcidentaUy fired when a 
mechanic dropped a wrench. 

Don't get stuck 

lugging stuff home 
that you don't want, 

Nineteen-eighty: Three limes false 
alarms caused our planes to take off and 
missiles to be readied for launch . They 
just had to tum the keys .... 

It is an insane game of Russian 
roulette . They have put the gun to our 
heads many times. We are just lucky 
that bullet has nOI come around yet. 
This is the son of thing we do not want 
to know about, but our desire to stop it 
from happening must be stronger than 
our desire to ignore it. Denial is an 
appropriate protection against sources 
of anxiety that cannot be eliminated, but 
is a serious obstacle to coping with 
removable threats such as nuclear 
weapons. 

On the question of how much effect 
people feel they can have, everyone 
united: The very lit/les have it, with 
about 60% marking this answer. It is 
panicularly ironic that the science 
students, who are most likely to put 
their learning to work designing more 
and better weapons, share this shrug-of-
the-shoulders attitude. (About one-half 
of the world's scientists are working for' 
the military.) 

My own response to that question 
would have been "a fair amount," since I 
took the step and attended a meeting of 
SPNW two months ago. Now I know 
exactly what I can do - and what you 
can do. I can read books like With 
Enough Shovels, and talk to people and 
write about what I read. 1 can sign the 
Freeze Voter Pledge. At UCSD, the 
Depanment of Science, Technology and 
Public Affairs offers several well-attended 
classes. This quarter, it offered 
Consequences of Nuclear War, Energy: 
Nuclear Technology, and the START 
Simulation. Today (May 31), Karen 
Wimhurst. will speak about the 
Greenham Common protest that 
occurred in England; this meeting is at 
6 pm in PH 104, and we encourage 
everyone to attend. 

"After taking this survey, I have found 
out I do not know beans about nothing." 
"I hate being a pawn." "The general 
public is not well informed, yet not 
much is being done to change this 
situation." These are the voices of 
people who do not know what to do. 
Now you have a lot of ideas, so do not 
give in to everyday pressures and ignore 
nuclear war. Remember the everyday life 
of those men at NORAD.

Cricketing; A P-oet' s inspiration 
.. 

Standing around and doing ~othm.g 
By JAMES RALPH PAPP 

If one asked an American what the most popular 
sport in the world is, it is quite likely he would answer 
soccer. But if one asked him to name the second most 
popular spon in the world, me chances are 
incalculably against his replying cricket. Yet cricket it 
is. 

Nearly unknown in America, cricket is played 
everywhere else the English language is spoken, and in 
Australia. Wherever the British empire has fallen will 
be the green with its characteristic manicured 

rectan~r pitch in the middle, sparsely populated by 
white lianneJed players: Africa, the West Indies, South 
America, India, Asia, Canada, me Pacific, and, unless 
they ha~ nothing resembling summer, probably 
Antarctica too. . 

Although it resembles basebal, as far as one hits a 
ball with a stick and then runs, it possesses an ethic of 
its own. Cricket is much older than basebaR, having 
been played in a primiti~ Conn at least 700 years ago. 
Excessive age will lend a grandeur to anything. and 
produce a care wim which it is handled. With this in 

· mind, cricketers don spotless white flannels, place 
themselves on a beautiluDy kept lawn in a quaint. 
pastoral situation, and spend long summer hours doing 
as near to nothing as they can while stiR caBing it 
spon. From this they take leisurely breaks to ruck into 
extravagant luncheons and teas. 

The reason they are afforded the opponunity for 
inactivity is that in cricket, hitting the ball is not 
necessarily a desirable goal. The batter's duty is to 
protect me wicket, which is made up of three three-foot-
high "stumps," each about an inch in diameter. There 
are two Wickets at opposite ends of the pitch, placed 

about a pitcher's mound distance from home plate 
from each other, and each has a batter protecting it. 
The bowler bowls me baR at one of the wickets, the 

. baU bouncing on the ground, and if me ball looks like 
it is going to hit the wicket, the batter bats it out of the 
way. H it does not, he does not. Even when he hits the 
ball, the point is only to deflect it, not to send it off to 
the nether dislllnces of the field for a good scoring 

. opportunity. Of alurse if this opportunity arises he will 
take it, JUnning down the pitch to the opposite wicket, 
ttading places with me other batter, and doing this as 
ofDen as he can as long as he can protect a wicket 
&om me bowler when the han arrives back. Indeed, 
before the bowler strikes one of the wickets with me 
ball, perhaps after an afternoon of play, the batter .can 
have built up one or two hundred runs. But he does 
not have to. Then the bowler has to go through ten . . . 
more batters to complete 'She inninp. A major IIWdl

One can ICe how &his tate of activity might ~ .

tries to eaplain cricket, he will fail: everyone has So far. 
But there are leverallitetary anchologies on the marica 
devoted exclus~ly to cricket We would not e1CpCCt 
our IJII!jor writers to apply pen to paper about b~, 
but che names running thrOugh thae coDections are 
those of Charles Dickens, the 19th century novelist 
Mary Mitfon:l; the poets William Blake, lord Byron, 
lewis Carroll, Rudyard IUplil1& Sieafried Sassoon and 
Sir john Betjeman (the Iare laureate); and Cardinal 

Manning and Harold Pinter. There 'is even a modem 
novel on the subject, Hugh de SelinCQwt'1 !he Criclrltl

extensively in any collection of the poetry 'of cricket 

Why should cricket be such an inspiration for good 
poets (if not exactly good poetry)? Cricket is the game 
of me Gold~n Age, the mock tournament ~f the 
pastoral world. It is a spon of environment tamer than 
activity, a game of mood rather than~. Whether

Of course some people take their cricket seriously, 
and in professional tournaments one will ae batters 
with helmets and plexiglass face ~. The., 
machinations of cricket clubs sometimes cause 
scandals mat reach the covers of Britain's great dailies, 
for the spon is as big a business as any. But this is frowned

jungles, under the shadows of Indian IIeQlples, on woIf-
infested Canadian plains or AnlllrcQC ice llekls painted

Pitching puts Padres on perch 

Andy has been Hawking his goods aflate. but.. . 

The first th ird of the season is just 
about over for the San Diego Padres, 
and the team had hoped for more than 
the 25-21 , .543 record it owns (before 
last night's contest in New York). 
Nonetheless , the Padres find themselves 
perched at the top of the heap -
although a pan icularly precarious perch 
it is. With Los Angeles, Atlanta and 
surprising Cincinnati all within one-half 
game of the frontrunners , San Diego can 
find itself in fi rst one day and founh 
the next - and vice versa . 

Clearly, there is no Detroit Tigers club 
that will emerge in this division and 
win by 30 games; expect a struggle to 
the fin ish. Even Houston and San 
Francisco, mired in the cellar muck, 

Since end uring their 
seven-game losi ng 
streak at home ear-
lier th is mo nth , 
the Padres have 
gone 7-3. More re-
markably, they are 
4-2 (again , before 
last night) on the 
current road trip that 
has swung them through 
Montreal , Philadelphia , 
New York and all the disgust-
ing weather associated with the 
East Coast. Looking ahead , San Diego 
can see eight doublheaders on the hori-
zon. Five of these involve make-up games 
caused by rain-outs. With other NL West 
clubs facing similar predicaments, and 
with the strain such a schedule puts on any 

pitching staff, it is now 
clearer than ever that 

pitching will win the 
West. 

With this in 
mind, it is easy to 
see that the Dodg-
ers have the edge ; 

injuries and the ir 
bullpen will dictate 

the remainder of their 
season. The Padres have a 

definite chance, especially if their 
performance of late continues. 

With five staners slumping at the plate, 
including Tony Gwynn, Steve Garvey and 
Terry Kennedy, San Diego has been 
winning with pitching - above all , relief 
pitching, which is the element of the game 
which simply diSintegrated earlier in the 

.. . Kennedy hasn't been Tearing into the ball. 

month . In panicular, Dave Dravecky and 
Craig Leffens have looked very strong in 
the late innings. Lefferts has pitched two 
stints of three-inning shutout ball to help 
preserve two of the club's wins this week, 
and Dravecky kept Montreal from scoring 
in the final twO frames to win a 2-1 contest 
in 11 innings. The staning pitching has 
also looked better, with Andy Hawkins, 
Eric Show and Tim Lollar turning in 
excellent startS in the past week. 

fi nd themselves only 5 'll and eight 
games back, respectively. One or both of 
these clubs can be expected to put up a 
struggle before the cunains are drawn in 
October. 

As the Garv towels off, the Chicken sees the Pads at the top of the heap - at least for now. 

Nevertheless, considering the slumps of 
key hitters in the line-up, San Diego has yet 
to regain the combination that thrust it 
head and shoulders above the competition 
in early April . However, one gets the feeling 
that the club is staning to put it together 
again. The main question the rest of the 
way is whether or not eight doubleheaders 
and the everydar stresses and strains of 
the remainder 0 the season will keep the 
Padres from the division title they have yet 
to approach in 16 seasons.

Intramural Softball Playoff Preview 

The school year is winding to a close and that 
means softball playoffs are starting to gear up. You 
can feel it in the air. The urge to get out and play 
some softball on a nice summer day. Competition, 
exercise, socializing, and a Bud to top the day off. 
Makes you want to forget finals. Heaven forbid! 

Well here it is, the Budman looks into his foggy 
crystal ball again to make his fearless predictions. 
You don't want to be picked #1 by the Budman. I've 
had a run of bad picks lately. Heck, you think 
having your picture on the CO'\'er of Sports 
Illustrated is a jinx. That's nothing like being 
picked to \'\(in it all by the Budman. I'm about one 
for 1984. But it's not my fault. The teams I've 
picked are chokers. They can't handle the pressure 
of being given the prestigious # 1 by the Budman. So 
with these softball playoffs I've gone out and not: 
necessarily picked the most .talented team but the 
team with the most intestinal fortitude. Guts is 
what it's called. These #1's picked by the Budman 
would give blood through a PVC pipe just to win. 
No prima donnas here. Just tough gritty ball 
players. 

Look for the Budman jinx to end once and for all 
this Quarter!

a new adaptation for the theater 
of Jarostaw Hasek's book of the 
same title, AmerIcan audiences 
were nnt Introduced to this 
virtually unheard of ~ropean 
masterpiece by the playwright 
Brecht, whose version these two 
local writers decided Just was

all have InteratIng reasons b' 
their Involvement. "I was 
attrac:ted by Its odd humor," 
said Lopez. ''The kind that 
makes you laugh and barf at the 
same time." Mesa Krzemlen-
lewska, a body movement 
consultant for the production 
stated during rehearsals that 
SYf.tk represents the conaclous 
force of Individual growth: "He 
Is lmematlonalln his Image and 
his asylum amidst tunnoll," 
"Self-awareness," Polak stated, 
"meaning, 'Only idiots can be 
free In tbls worleL' In Hasek's 
words. Is an essential way of 
saying through these characters 
that man's ellstence Is 
subservIeIK under the reign of 
the super-power governments In 
our countries. Hasek's book Is 
like a bible In ~pe because It 
Is the only way to make a satire 

of the governine& A reason I 
came tom Poland to this 
country was to be able to 
express my feelings, and that's 
something you cannot do over 
there." 

In Goo.d Soldier, two 
conventions will be seen for the 
nnt time this year In UCSD 
theater: laser lights and 

~ acting. Martin 
Lopez and Michael Brown have 
designed Iuers whose use go 
beyond the standard "Lata'.' 
lum" shows prevalently found at 
carnivals. ''The lasers you will be 
seeing are not supposed to look 
like your usual beam. They will 

havea~purlty,dlrectlon 
and color," says Lopez. A large 
single screen In the center of the 
stage transforms the lasers Into 
characters and set pieces with 
actual dialog, "The Iuers will be 

a nmator, the Lard God, a 
sweetheart, a chair and a 
backdrop, b' eampie," .,. 
Lopez. "They (the two 
conventions) will give our play 
an unworldly look." 1be second 
tool Is an Inte.. training 
method for actors which 
stresses body movements and 
the visual context more than the 
play's actual words. 1be be1lefls

Well, so do the words. and vice-
vena. 

The show will be presented 
for tree each night: Its $2,000 
budget was donated by the 
Committee for the Undagraclu-
ate Arts restlval '84 and 
Undergraduate Student Grants. 
The Good Soldier run will be 
dedicated to the memory of the 
late UCSD drama profeaor Alan 
Schneider, In tribute to the 
great Inftuence he had on 
theater around the world. 

"It's a nice way to relax and 
ease tension from ftnals week;" 
says Lopez. 1be show runs 
apprOlimately one hour long. 



A rock and 
a roll and a 
sympbony 

By JAIRS MLPII rArr 
Sam Shepard was recently 

declared to be the thinking 
woman's sex symbol (or a 
woman's thinking sex symbol: 
The difference Is ambiguous). 
and although Shepard Is not In 
town, ucept perhaps on some 
old celiuloicL the thinking 
woman or man can ' experience 
him vlcaJ10usly through the San 
Diego Rep's production of his 
Tooth of Crime. 

However. despite enough 
profanity, scatology and 
obscenity to clear out most of 
the season 'Subscribers by 
Intermission. the first halfofthe 
play moves slowly. It 
establishes an environment and 
characters, and sets up the 
confrontation of the second 
half. and although the 
environment and characters are 
Interesting. a futurlstlc-and-roll 
Industry cum battlefield. 
populated by buslnessmen-
strategists and muslclan-
warriors. It Is the confrontation 
that all this builds up to that the 
audience Is waiting for. 

When the confrontation does 
come, the two strongest actors 
and most complicated 
characters dominate the stage,

In the Richard Strauss

a phenomenon, a sort of mass

from snoring. The man on my

Many rock bands won't be 

satlslled until they're playing 
huge arenas and stadia, but Let's 
Active seemed perfectly content 
to begin Its recent tour at Magic 
Mountain. 

"It was fun," says drummer 
Sara Rornweber. "We got to ride 
all the rides." That statement 
about sums up Let's Active, 
three kids In their lOs with a 
buoyantly youthful sound. Led 
by slnger-gultarlst Mitch r.aster, 
who also co-produces the 
considerably weightier R.~M., 
the group already has a ftne six-
lOng ~F called I{oot to Its 
credit 

Let's Active made very 
favcnble Impresstons with Its 
two support appearances at 
SDSU In the Ia!t few months. 
("We're the oftIclal Montezuma 
Hall opening banet." r.aster 
joked at the Jut one.) Wannlng 
up for ~ho and tbe Bunnymen 
In March. r.uter's adenoidal 
singing and north Carollna-
accented byplay enhanced his 
simple but Intelligent songs. 
noteworthy. too. was the wildly 
overgrown hair of ~ster, 
Komweber and bassist !'aye 
Hunter. wblch helped give them 
a look that was not only pre-
adolescent - like little kids 
who don't 18ft to worry about 

The latest and greatest sound 
from tbose bipsters Let's Active 
parents' fashion dictates - but 
also Intriguingly androgynous. 

About the only thing missing 
from that show was multi-
IlL'Itnamentalist Lynn Blakey. 
who had graced the band's 
concert (with R.~.M.) last 
november. Blakey, who added a 
mostly visual . dlmelL'llon with 
her dance steps - well, step -
and by looking very much like a 
girl and a very cute one It that. 

his since returned to her own 
group, the wonderfully-named 
Broken Crayon. 

Let·s ActIve's best song to 
date Is "~ery Word Means no," 
heard on 91X. but almost as 
good are the gloriously mushy 
"Hake Up with Me" - "Say 
more. mean less/Who needs this 
mess? /Unless you do .... " - and 
the deceptively playful .. Leader 
of Men," a cutting mockery of 

the respect ~ccorded authority 
ftgures. 

Hunter makes the most of her 
lone lead vocal on .fooL as her 
unschooled singing on .. Room 
with a View" has all the 
unaffected chann of Richard 
farnsworth's non-actJng In The 
(iteM fM 

The ~p bas garnered 
widespread. but not unanimous, 
critical praise. 

There's a decided '60s llavor 
to Let's Active's music. but the 
group's diverse tastes prevent It 
from Joining the Paisley 
Underground. f.aster says the 
trio has been listening to a lot of 
'70s pop lately, as well as a 
number of Led Zeppelin (I) 
tape.!. 

Let's Active would seem to be 
an Ideal beacb-weather band. 
but fans will have to walt for the 
next record. The group Is 
currently In the studio working 
on its first album. which should 
be out. r.aster hopes. "before 
school starts. ..

Bob's Book Report 
ItIore insight on cops and 
robbers and aliens in 'Unes' 

By ROB~1lT 1E0ftf 
Una and Shadows, the 

latest book by Joseph 
Wlmbaugh, Is the story of 
possibly the most bizarre police 
operation In tact or ftctlon.lt Is 
the worked-over story of a real-
life experiment by the San Diego 
Police Department aimed at 
reducing border banditry 
against Illegal aliens by sending 
oIk:ers Into the Mexican Border 
regions disguised as Illegal 
aliens, and then waiting around 
until someone b1ed to rob 
them. 

Of course, as In all activities 
Involving objects as compli-
cated as human beings and the 
caHfomla Penal Code, nothing 
Is ever that simple. 

"It was quite a bit to handle 
for a lad 24 yars old, all this 
attention. Of course he didn't 
lIDdentand that he was an 

4 m.tu May .n, 1984 

embodiment of an American 
myth, an honest-to-God bandlt-
busting, badge-toting, shoot-
from-the-hlp gunslinger. 

"All he knew was that 
everyone wanted to give him 
blowjobs." 

wambaugh knows better than 
to make his book a simple tale 
(or glorlftcatlon) of the Border 
Allen Robbery force. He writes 
of the provincialism of the son> 
In the '70s, the relationship 
between the SOPD and the 
TtJuana Police Department (and 
some exposition of the reasons 
behind Illegal Immigration -
nothing deep, but enough for 
background), and other sundry 
and myriad things. If you have 
lived In San Diego for any period 
of time, this book Is chock-full 
of local color. 

If you don't know a little 
about local political geography, 

a map Is deftnltely helpful when 
you read this book. 

Despite his wide range of 
Interests and coverage, 
wambaugh's chief Interest Is In 
the Individual police omcers, 
and how they changed during 
this (discontinued) experiment 
In reducing crime statistics for 
America's finest City. A 
comparison with The Right 
stu6mlght be In order, for after 
the first pltiS notices of their 
nightly performances, the 
adulation of groupies and 
others ~s astounding. All the 
old western myths about 
lawmen were revived for this 
group, especially as their de 
facto leader, Manny Loper. had a 
habit of drawing his gun when 
people were aiming at him.
