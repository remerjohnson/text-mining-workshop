The Wall Committee has begun 
to develop a way to commemo-

solution is the construction of a 
permanent wall in place of the 
existing wooden structure 
elsewhere on the campus which 
would still support students'

Professor Says Empathy Prevents War 
By ErIc Schmidt 
Senior Staff Writer 

People are not genetical ly pro-
grammed to war, but individual 
perception shaped by brain devel-
opment may be leading humanity 
down a genetic blind alley, Neuro-
sciences Profe sor Emeritus Rob-
ert Livingston said in a Thursday 
night lecture. 

According to Livingston, 
founding chair of the UCSD Neu-
rosciences Department and pas.t 
president of the Physicians for 
Social Responsibility, the brain 
shapes perception early in life,caus-
ing many of the misunderstand-
ings between cultures and nations. 

Livingston said these miscon-
ceptions limit chances for global 
peace, which he said is necessary 
to prevent the destruction of the 

world through nuclear holocaust 
or some other disaster. 

"We have our own destiny in 
our hands, and we have a require-
ment forthe achievement of global 
cooperation and global understand-
ing in a very short period of time," 
Livingston aid. 

But such cooperation requires 
compassion and empathy, both of 
which are impeded by the design 
of the human brain, according to 
Living ton. 

"The catch-22 is that our world 
view is not only idiosyncratic," 
Livingston said. The brain itself is 
shaped by experiences early in life 
that alter our perception of events, 
he added. 

"Since we' re not aware of this 
dynamic, we tend to project evil in 
judgement of bad behavior onto 

others. This affects all ocial rela-
tions - the family, the pulpit. the 
legi lalUre and e pecially diplo-
macy," he said. 

Livingston likened the global 
si tuation to a group of five billion 
color-blind people, each blind to a 
different color. 

As an example, Livingston cited 
relations with Middle East nat ions. 
He said perceptual misunderstand-
ings arising from Iingui tic, cul-
tural and individual differences 
profoundly affect U.S.-Arab rela-
tions. 

In the '80s, Livingston trav-
elled with a group of Americans 
through the Middle East on a mis-
sion of peace. "In almost every 
country, they put us on the spot. 
The assumption was that we were

Balloting 
Begins 
Tomorrow 
A.S.: Six amendments and 
referenda to be decided 
By Francisco DeVries 
News Editor 

Balloting forthe Associated Stu-
dents' special election begins to-
morrow and will continue for two 
day . 

The election was mandated by 
the A.S. Judicial Board last year 
because the three consti tutional 
amendments placed on the regular 
Spring ballot were placed in a dif-
ferent order than in the sample bal-
lot printed in the Guardian. 

The A.S. is footing the $3.000 
bill for the special election and has 
added three separate referendaques-
tions to the ballot. 

The first amendment question to 
be voted on again would allow the 
A.S. to place up to five constitu-
tional amendments on a ballot, in-
stead of the current three. It passed 
82.8 percent to 17.2 percent in the 
original balloting. 

The second amendment would 
change the position of student advo-
cate to an elected member that is 
allowed to cast a vote. It had passed 
by a three to one margin. 

The third amendment to be de-
cided would eliminate the class des-
ignation for A.S. senatorial posi-
tions. It passed 64 percent to 36 
percent in la t spring's election. 

The three additional referenda 
do not affect the A.S. constitution. 
The first question asks students 
whether the number of student re-
gent should be increased, currently 
one, to one for each of the nine UC 
campu es. 

The second que tion is a survey 
of campus newspaper readership and 
the third asks students whether they 
would approve a mandatory AIDS 
general education lecture. 

TIle rally was sponsored by a 
number of campus groups includ-
ing the Associated Students, Gradu-
ate Student Assoication, IFC/ 
Panhellenic and Student Affirma-
tive Action Council (SAAC). Speak-
ers included faculty members, the 

According to Third College stu-
dent Nick Andres, there were three 
main reasons for holding the rally: 
to send a message out to the public 
that students do care about the issue, 
to get students involved, and to build 
coalitions. Andres stressed the need 
formobilizationamongstudentsand 
clubs, adding that there will be many 
more rallies. 

Revelle Senior ErIn DIgnan writes to a IePlator during rally. 

"It's rea1ly important to go out 
and start talking to people and build-
ingnetworksbetweenclubs' We've 
got to mobilize and we've got to 

believe in ourselves. Governor Wil-
son has hown that he has ab 0-
lutely no commitment tohigheredu-
cation. If we don 't start doing any-

thing, this university will no longer 
be a public institution," Andre aid.

Research Into Geckos 
Shows Community Ute 
REPllLES: Study gives valuable insight into how 
different gecko species struggle for control of habitat 
By Eric Schmidt 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD researchers studying gec-
kos in Hawaii have unearthed 
mechanisms ofcompeti lion between 
species which may lead to a better 
understanding of how introduced 
animals displace native species. 

Biology Professor Ted Case and 
graduate students 
Kenneth Petren and 
Douglas Bolger re-
poned the results 
from the first direct 
observationofcom-
petitive displace-
ment in last week's 

walls, was lined along the bunkers 
to keep them gecko-proof. 

The habitat was made to be as 
natural as possible so that "what's 
going on in the system is close to 
what 's going on in nature," Petren 
said. 

The researchers watched the gec-
kos compete fOJ: food around the 

lights. They had hy-
pothesized that the 

i sue of Science. 
Petren said that, 

while competitive 
displacement i of-
ten inferred, " mrely 
can you see it hap-
pen [in a short time 
spanJ." 

"People may not 
care [about 
competing 

maller, asexual na-
tive geckos were 
being driven from 
the lights and food 
byaggres i ve mal 
from the invading 
species. 

Ca e and hi tu-
dents found that the 
male invaders were 
aggressive only to-
ward other males. 
not to the small

addition, the

Biology graduate student driving the subor-

dinate asex uals 
In converted 

mi litary ai rplane hangers on the is-
land of Oahu, the researchers 
w3lched two species of gecko bailie 
for food and survival. 

They had traced the ri val ry of the 
two gecko species throughout the 
South Pacific for five years. watch-
ing one gecko con istently displace 
the other in urban habitats. 

The first gecko. the mourning 
gecko, was transported throughout 
the Pucific by Polynesians and had 
been living on the islands for thou-
sands of years. When the house 
gecko was introduced recently. it 
quickly became the dominant spe-
cies. 

To determine why a newcomer 
would knock out an ex isting spe-
cies. Case and his students firsr 
watched the lizards battle it out in 
glass jars. 

After finding that the smaller 
mouming geckos were being de-
nied equal access to food, the re-
searchers decided to invest igate the 
competition in a more natural set-
ting. 

The hangers provided the right 
cont rolled env ironment for the 
tudy. 

Light were placed in the build-
ing to attract and control the con-
centr.ltion of insects, the geckos' 
food source. 

Auon,aslippery ubstancewhich 
limits the lizards' ability to cling to 

from the light just 
because the asexuals were avoiding 
the sexual n they were foraging:' 
Petren said. 

The small asexuals. used to tay-
ing away from larger. aggres ive 
asexual geckos. would not approach 
the large male geckos. In areas of 
con entrated food, only the largest 
of asexuals could survive. 

The researchers will return to the 
bunkers this year to determine 
whether or not other factors affect 
the survival of the gecko . 

" If we could pick out the mecha-
nisms that are operating in this case. 
hopefully we' ll be able to k.now 
what causes an invading species to 
ucceed," Petren said. 

The next time he observe the 
lizards, Perren said he will be in a 
small, screened-off area in the 
middle of a bunker. 

He will spend several hours each 
night for fouror five months watch-
ing the gecko forage near lights 
and recording the information on a 
computer. 

The research being conducted 
by Case and students, while having 
no immediate use, increa~e the ba-
ic knowledge of competitive di -

placement mechanism • Petren aid. 
" Peoplemaynolcare[aboutcom-

ingly we may want to know more 
about communities and how to man-
age them," he said.

TRIBUTE TO 

Geophysics Professor To 
Receive Earth Selene .. Prize 

Geophysics Professor Walter Munk at the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography has been selected as the 
recipient of the Columbia University Vetlesen Prize, the 
premier award in the earth sciences. Munk will receive 
the prize, which includes a gold medal and $50,000, at 
a formal dinner at Coluni>ia University on Thursday, Jan. 
21. 

Munk's pioneering research has led to new under-
standing of WfNeS, tides, ocean circulation, the earth's 
rotation and the use of sound to study global oceans. 
Most recently, he led the development of acoustic 
tomography of the ocean with the theory that by studying 
sound propagation pattems and the time it takes for 
sound to trfNel through the oceans, it would be possible 
to detect Important information about the ocean's large-
scale structure. Munk has also performed a number of 
significant ocean warming experiments donceming urr 
derwater acoustic signals and its global transmissions. 

In 1960, he established a branch of the UC's 
Institute of Geophysics at Scripps and served as its 
director until 1982.

to the UC sy tern. To fully offser 
this $194 milJion reduction, an ad-
ditional increase of approximately 
$1,925 per student would be re-

COMMENTARY 
Bill Clinton's toughest challenge could be living up to the inflated expectations of the voters who elected him 

KING OF THE HILL 
By PhIlip Michaels 
Opinion Editor 

A bout halfway through Aladdin, an unfamiliar feelingcameoverme - a strange warm and tingling 
sensation. II wasn't food poisoning 
brought on by the stale movie theater 
popcom or even the uleers that have 
plagued me for the past couple of 
years. 0, I felt good. iike a million 
bucks. And then it hit me - here I 
wa , an embittered. hate-filled, mis-
anthropic bastard, and a Disney car-
toon was filling me with joy and hap-
piness. I was bubbling over with love 
for humanity. 

Damn. I thought. This is Bill 
Clinton's influence. 

Everywhere you look, people are 
walking about with a spring in their 
step and a song in their heart. The 
flowers smell sweeler. Children are 
eating all their vegetables. Even the 
morning radio DJs eem less annoy-
ing. In shon, all that is right with the 
world i charging forward, full peed 
ahead. And all becauseofBjII Clinton.

Bill Clinlon 's in charge now. and Ihat

That mean free health care, a slew of 
jobs, and "putting people flfSl." Why, 
as soon as our man Bill finishe taking 
the oath of office. every single man, 
woman, and child in America will 
link arms and sing "Kumbayah." 

DOe this scenario seem likely? If 
you read the editorial page of the Los 
Angell'S Times or lisren to Clinton's 
spin doctors on C-SPAN. then sure, 
everything, from foreign policy to 
Hillary 's wardrobe, ' is groovy now 
that Clinton is about to be handed the 
keys to the White House. But for 
those of us mired in reality, it should 
be obviou that although America 

will be changing leaders this week, a 
lot of the problems facing this country 
will not fade away overnight. 

There' a dangerous trend in our 
society toward instant gratification 
and quick-fix solutions. We want re-
sults, and we want them /lOW, damn it. 
) should know-I'm pan oftheMTV 
generation, that diverse grouping of 
callow cynics that demands five-sec-
ond answers to five-hour problems. 
I'm probably not alone when I say 
that I don't give two hoots about 
industrial policy, gross natiorlaJ prod-
uct or what was behind that accursed 
recession - just do something to 

make my rent lower and my income 
higher. And be quick about it, I have 
other things to do. 

The biggest problem facing the 
Clinton administration is not anyone 
of the myriad of domestic and foreign 
issues addressed during the campaign. 
Clinton's greatest challenge could be 
living up to the inflated expectations 
of the voters who elected him. When 
you start talking about a "mandate for 
change" or ''taking our government 
back," that's a pretty tough claim to 
live up to, especially when Clinton is 
burdened with the unfonunate ten-
dency of acting like an unprincipled 
weasel. 

We saw two indications of this 
tendency in the past few weeks on 
two completely different issues -
Chelsea Clinton's education and U.S. 
policy towards Haitian refugees. 
Throughout the campaign, Clinton 
had opposed vouchers for private 
schools and voiced his suppon for 
public education. Yet, when the time 
came to choose a school for their 
daughter, the Clintons sent her off to 
private school, a choice unavailable 
to many Americans. With that deci-
ion, Clinton seemed to be saying that 

what was good for everyone else's 
children wasn't good enough for his. 

Clinton 's reversal on policy to-
wards Haitian refugees is far more 
distressing. Throughoutthecampaign, 
Clinlon had attacked the Bush

BILL CLINTON-
INNOCENCE ABROAD 
COMLEJtI1ARY: The new president might be forced 
into walking the walk of international diplomacy 
By Roderick Lee 
Staff Writer 

Domestic policy can gel liS throwlI 
0 111 of office. Fortigll policy call gel 
LIS killed. - George Bush 

Patrick Buchanan ridiculed Bill 
Clinton for u ing fewer than "150 
words to discus foreign policy in an 
acceptance speech that lasted almost 
an hour." Hopefully, Clinton will 
pend more than 150 hours in formu-

lating American policy. 
Meanwhile, George Bush was in 

the process of merging his political 
career with rwo of the most influential 
figures of thi s century: Winston 
Churchill, who achieved phenomenal 
succe in the world arena only to face 
apostwarelection ouster, and Mikhail 
Gorbachev, who was loved by outsid-
ers but reviled by his own country-
men. 

Now, as we come to the close of 
the Bush years, Team Slick i slowly 
backing away from its campaign 
promises regarding the economy 
while the world is quietly becoming 
more dangerous again, 

Despite the end of the Cold War, 
both Jane's Defellse Weekly and the 
Freedom House think-tank believe 
that the chances of the United States 
being drawn into one of numerous 
tlashpoint is greater than before. The 
new president may find himselfwant-
ing 10 talk the domestic talk but being 
forced to walk the international diplo-
macywalk. 

For tarters, there i , of course, 
Eastern Europe. The break-up of the 
Hapsburg empire at the tum of the 
century direc tly led to World War I. 
Already we have seen what over half 
a millennium of ethnic history can do 
to the Balkans. Will the break-up of 
the Soviet empire lead to World War 
ID? 

While no side of the Yugoslav 
conflict is blameless, it was Serbian 
President Siobodan Milosevic, who 
won election by inciting Serb jingo-
ism, then made the decision to attack 
first Slovenia and then Croatia fol-
lowing their declarations of indepen-
dence. And it is Milosevic who con-
tinues to back the Bosnian Serbs even 
after ethnic cleansing horror stories 
were made public. 

Furthermore, while attention is 
focu ed on Serbia, what the press 
ignores is that the Serbs can continue 
their aggression because one major 
country has chosen to flout the oil 
embargo. That country is Russia. 

In one of his few attempts to sound 
"presidential" on foreign affairs, 
Clinton moved to the i'lght of Bush, 
naively calling for air strikes against 
the Serbs as we did against Iraq. But 
mountainous Yugoslavia is not the 
flat Iraqi desen. The last time a Demo-
crat launched an air attack was the 
bombing of Hanoi. Will Yugoslavia 
become Clinton's Vietnam? 

It gets worse. Serb action threat-
ens to ignite the entire Balkan tinder-
box. With Serb objectives met in 
Bosnia, Milosevic may now set his 
sights on Kosovo, an autonomous 
region within Serbia which borders 
both Albania and newly-independent 
Macedonia. It was in Kosovo where 
Milosevic flfSt incited Serb national-
ism to win the Serb presidency, and it 
i in Kosovo where the Serbs may 
finally bite off more than they can 
chew. 

Any action by Milosevic against 

the Albanian majori ty there is sure to 
trigger an Albanian response. And, a 
worst case scenario would see two 
NATO allies, Greece and Turkey, 
drawn to opposite sides of the first 
major European war since 1945. 

The attention reserved for the 
Balkans has drJwn the pres away 
from an even greater trouble area: the 
former Soviet Union. The Baltic states 
are once again independent, but Rus-

ia till mai ntains garrisons in allthree 
countries. And that is the lea t of our 
worrie . 

The Central Asian republics are 
all ripe breeding ground for lranian-
tyle Muslim fundamentalism with 

an added twi t: the largest Asian re-
public, Kazakhstan, ha inherited part 
of the Sovier nuclear arsenal. As a 
preview of what could happen. 
Tajik tan i embroiled in civil war 
precisely between a fundamentali t 
faction and a coalition of ecularists, 
Russians and other non-Muslims. 

In the Caucasus mountains, which 
also border Iran, Armenia and 
Azerbaijan have been waging their 
own ethnic war ince before Yeltsin 
rose to power. A movement by Ira-
nian Azeri to reunify with the former 
Soviet republic remains active, ju t 
Ie s vocal. And nearby sits Georgia, 
the on ly former republic which is not 
a member of the CIS becau e, at thi 
time, there was no legitimate govern-
ment . 

Funhermore, let us not forger that 
one quarter of a major NATO country 
sits on Ihe wrong ide of the di -
mantled [ron Cunain. After almost 
half a century of division, German 
reunification instantly made Germany 
the premier nation of the Continent 
once again. But, reunificationhasseen 
its problems. The bankrupt east is 
suffering from a rise of neo-Nazism. 

Finally. there is Africa, truly the 
"Dark Continent" when it comes to 
the shining light of pluralistic democ-
racy. Most of the countries that have 
made the least progress in Freedom 
House 's annual rat ing system all lie in 
sub-Saharan Africa. 

Of equal, if not greater, despera-
tion as Somalia is Liberia, formerly 
the flrst African democracy. Like 
Somalia, Liberia has been lacking a 
stable government for sevend years. 
Unlike Somalia, the Organization for 
African Unity has sent in a West 
African peacekeeping force to help 
restore order. 

Hopefully, our presence in Soma-
lia can prevent this situation from 
arising there as well. Indeed, Somali 
reaction to President Bush 's recent 
visit is a positive sign. 

It is a testament to George Bush 
that he is only the second American 
president to visit a sub-Saharan Afri-
can nation. Ronald Reagan made 
Americagreatagain, but George Bush 
completed the restoration of world 
respect. During last year's campaign, 
Bush's largest crowds were a world 
away, in Warsaw. 

In the words of Senate Minority 
Leader,BobDole(R-Kan),theAmeri-
can voters have traded in an "experi-
enced world statesman" for "some-
one whose only foreign policy expe-
rience i playing a Vienna waltz on 
the saxophone." We can only hope 
that Mr. Clinton' own inexperience 
will not drastically reverse all the 
progress we made during the Reagan-
Bush years.

Rough wat.s Ahead For Clinton 
Some of the Possible Trials and Tribulations the New President Will Face 

Govemlng 
This would seem to be an obvious one, ~i nce goveming is the business of 
the president. But when Clinton moves into the While House lomorrow. 
some 3,000 second-and Ihird·tier presidential appointments will have not 
been made. Critics have abo expressed fears that a Democratic president 
combined with a Democrat-controlled Congres could spell di a-Ier. 

The DefIcit, Stupid 
The economy is coming back slowly but surely - wi lh a few notable 
exceptions, like Califomia - bul Ihe deficit is not gelling any beller. The 
Bush admin i tration reponed last week that the revised deficil figures 
anlounted to $18 billion more than originally expected. In respon.e, Clinton 
spokespeople alluded to scrapping some of Clinlon 's deficit-cuuing 
programs. So much for thm middle class tax cut.. . 

Foreign Policy 
The post-Cold War world has n I ocen a Jl<!<Iceful one. The troubles in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Somalia and the Persian Gulf are items of immediate 
concern, but they are by no mean~ Ihe only ones. Olher powder kegs: Soulh 
Africa. India , Pakistan and, of course, the C rnmonweahh of Independent 
States. Clinton will also be faced with the challenge of reshaping Ihe role of 
the military now Ihat the Cold War is over. 

"Change" 
After pledging to give Ihe AmeriC<tn govemment back to Ihe people. 
Clinton will be under intense scrutiny to "put people firsr" in his new 
administration. Crilics point to some of his appointments - Ron Brown. 
Warren Christopher and Lloyd Bentsen- as an indication of more of the 
same inside-the-be ltway shenanigans the Democrals aHacked so effeclively

THE NEW SHERIFF IN TOWN 
COMMENTARY: Everyone is talking about Bill Clinton's potential to be one of 
the greatest leaders in the nation' history, but now is the time for action, not words 
By Damen Scranton 
Associate Opinion Editor 

I hear there's going to be a new 
sheri ff in town. 

A sheriff with a green Ihumb and 
a great poker face, who can play the 
blues. feel those thighs bum and real-
izes the economic import.1nce of our 
nation's fast food industry. One with 
avvy and poise who looks good on 

TV, with a blue-collar voice and an 
underpriv ileged, inner-city child on 
his knee. 

But since, sooner or later, news of 
this commentary will inevitably and 
monolithically make its way to the 
main man himself, and that I will 
undoubtedly be put to death by some-
one because of ils lack of vision and 
optimism, I would like 10 take this 
opportunity to extend my most heart-
felt congratulations to the entire 
Clinton clan. Mr. Clinton,you'vejust 
become the most powerful man in the 
known universe! What are you going 
to do? 

Well, it 'd be a good story at least, 
and great for the Disney Company. 
But who would be crazy enough to go 
to Disneyland with all of these ter-
rible problems at home? Plus it 's so 
damn expensive. No, Mr. Clinton, I 
must say that I'd never want to be in 
your size lOs. The world is on a one-
way track to some son of environ-
mental Armageddon and you just put 
on the engineer's costume. And faith 
may bum a cross into some woman's 
tuna melt in Omaha, but it doesn't fill 
ozone holes or resurrect the Santa 
Barbara song sparrow ... ortheTecopa 
pupfish .. . or the Sampson's Pearly 
mussel. It just doesn't. 

So you've got to have a plan. A 
plan to put an end to the poverty that 
isa way of life for more than a quarter 
of your children. A plan to put an end 
to the social and political turmoil that 
threatens to destroy your country, and 
all those other countries, too. A plan 
to end worldwide tarvation, salvage 
what's left of your natural resources , 
spawn massive national economic 
growth, find solutions to critical health 

No, Mr. Clinton, I 
must say that I'd 
never want to be in 
your size lOs. Faith 
may bum a cross Into 
some woman's tuna 
melt in Omaha, but It 
doesn't fill ozone 
holes or resurrect the 
Santa Barbara song 
sparrOW ••• or the 
Tecopa pupllsh. It Just 
doesn't. 
problems such as AJDS and basically 
just make the world a better place for 
future generations. And don't forget 
contentedness, fulfillment and a blue-
bird for everyone's shou Ider. 

I personally think you should dd 
something about how people in the 
United States view the environment. 
The human race has been in direct 
conflict with its Mother for some time 
now. Maybe it's just a phase, but I 
don 't think so. And since it leapt fOl1h 
and graced the world with its purple 
mountains majesty just over 200 years 
·ago, your country has lead the charge 
against the environment and has had 
immeasurable success in the degra-
dation of aI/life, not just that which is 
in the minority. You name it- hunt-
ing, logging, animal exploitation, air 
and water pollution - we lead the 
way. 

We release more carbon dioxides 
into the atmosphere than any other 
country in the world, both as a na-
tional community and per capita. You 
yourself, Mr. Clinton, were probably 
responsible for more than 20 tons of 
emiss ions. Gasp. 

When I was just one year old in 
1974 - right near the end of that war 
and orne time after you got back 
from England, there were just over a 
hundred threatened and endangered 
species in the United States. Now, 

Ihere are over 650. Am I in some way 
responsible for Ihat? Are you'! People 
in this country don't give a rat' a~s 
about tho~e animals for ~ome rcason. 
I guess we saved Ihe California COIl -
dol'. and (hat '~ whal really m:ltler~. 

Your cilizens also dump 230 mil-
lion tons of urban solid waste illlo the 
air. water and soil each and every 
year. I know that we live in a really big 
world and that breaks down to barely 
692 Ions of olid waste per person per 
year, but it's still kindofa lot. wouldn ' t 
you say? 

I think Ihat whall'lll trying 10 say, 
Mr. Clinton. is that if you look at Ihe 
facts-the smog and the oil spills, the 
medical waste and Ihe species Ihat 
have finally reached extinction, the 
places where I could have sworn trees 
used to be - you will see that some-
thing has gone terribly wrong with 
your country. Don'( think I'm hold-
i ng you personal I y respon i ble for the 
uncountable errors of you forefathers. 
Lord knows how much while men 
hate that. But I do want you to know 
that I am holding you (and AI, I sup-
pose) very much responsible (or rhe 
ecological direction of this nation for 
the next four years. 

You and that convenient ly-named 
little hometown of yours have in-
spired a lot of hope in a lot of innocent 
and well-meaning people. Maybe a 
little bit too much hope, if there 'ssuch 
a thing. Everyone is talking aboul the 
renewed sense of optimistic patrio-
tism that your election has inspired. 
Everyone is talking about yourpoten-
tial as one of the greate t leaders in the 
brief but intense history of the United 
States. Everyone is talking. Now let 's 
see some action. You have the power 
to point this country in a new direc-
tion. That may sound corny, but I'd 
ratherbecomythanextinct, and we're 
running out of other species. Ju t re-
member what happened the last time 
a man came along with the possible 
vi ion and know-how to redefine thi 
countries role in the world; to, in fact, 
alter the course of history. 

Stay out of Dallas.

CHAUENGE: 
Clinton will face 
some tough problems 
ContInued from .... 4 
admini tration' policy of returning 
fleeing refugees to Haiti without giv-
ing them asylum hearings. Last Thurs-
day. in a broadcast on Voice of 
America radio, Clinton told any po-
tential refugees to tay at home, warn-
ing them that they would be returned 
to Haiti if they tried to seek asylum in 
the United States. 

While flip-flopping on i ues is 
convenient fun for the entire family, it 
ha potentially di astrous result . 
Unless Clinton wants legions of gull-
ible Democrats running about. 
screaming "Betrayed'" at the top of 
their lungs. he would be well advised 
to develop orne iOla of commitment 
to what he says and does. 

Thi does not mean, however. that 
Clinton is destined to fail. A lot of 
conservative have been running 
around in sackclOlh and ashes as of 
lare, bemoaning the imm inent demise 
of the Republic. Contrary to what die-
hard Republicans may think, the in-
auguration of Bill Clinton will not 
immediately plunge thi nation into 
the deepest pils of hell. I'd give him at 
least a month or two before he doe 

that. 
I'm kidding, of course. It ' ex-

tremely likely that Climon will have 
answers to some preuy tough ques-
tions. although I wouldn't expect the 
answers to come overnight. Clinton is 
in a position to establish himself as an 
extremely effective and important 
president. 

In pite of hi waffling on the 
middle class tax cut and his appoint-
ment of the contemptible Ron Brown 
to Secretary of the Commerce, I like 
Bill Clinton, I honestly do. The only 
truly repulsive thing that he's respon-
ible for, in my mind, i the upcoming 

Fleetwood Mac reunion. I mean, come 
on - Fleetwood Mac? They're up-
posed to embody hope in tomorrow 
for my generation? If Clinton had to 
ummon up a rock band from the 70s 

to attract younger voters, he could've 
at least called on the Eagles, KISS or 
Ted Nugent. I would have given any-
thing to see Tipper Gore dancing to 
"Cat Scratch Fever" at the Demo-
cratic Convention. 

But apart from reasse ing his taste 
in rock bands. what else does Clinton 
have to do to make America a won-
derful place once more? In spite of the 
recent flurry of"intemational crises," 
Clinton would be iII-advi ed to make 
foreign affairs his primary focus in 
the next few months. The troubles in 

Tueeday, January 19,1993 

Iraq, Bosnia and Somalia are cer-
tainly worth some concern, but most 
of the uproar merely amounts to a 
ome last minute saber-rattling on the 

part of George Bush, probably to di-
vert anention from his pardons of the 
Iran-Contra figures. Certainly, Clinton 
cannot afford to ignore these trouble 
spots, but his fIrst concem should be 
on the domestic front. 

(J u t 10 hours after writing that 
last paragraph, mean 01' Bush and the 
army have to make me look bad by 
gening into yet another conflict with 
Iraq. So much for my career as ·a 
pundit .. . ) 

Bill Clinton was elected because 
enough people thought domestic con-
cerns needed to be addressed. Thus. 
Clinton should exarnine way to con-
trolthe deficit, to reassess the nation's 
welfare program and to develop a 
policy that allows American technol-
ogy to compete on the international 
market. This was what Clinton was 
elected to do, and barring ome sud-
den, violent international crisis, this i 
what he needs to be concerned about. 

Sink or swim, the next four years 
will at least be interesting to watch. 
Personally, I'm hopeful that Clinton 
will be a succes . After all, if Clinton 
can make me feel happy during a 
Disney cartoon. this deficit thing 
shou Id be a snap.

WAR: Professor 
blame waron 
individual perception 
Continued from paee 1 
with the CtA.·' he aid. 

Living ton' contingent arrived 
in Kuwait hortlyaftertheChemobyl 
di aster. "[In] Kuwait, they greeted 
u with the fact that they had put out 
a lot of Geiger counters on the bor-
ders of Arab countries because west-
ern entrepreneurs were selling ra-
dioactively contaminated fruit," he 
said. 

He added that western tradition 
artributes a common global percep-
tion to all people and cultures. That 
idea is now disproven. 

Misunderstandings stemming 
from different cultural and personal 
perceptions often cause war, accord-
ing to Livingston. 

However, warlike"instinct "are 
not genetic, he said. He noted that 
the hi ' tory of evolution is mainly 
one of cooperation. "Likeother ani-
mals, [man] has the capacity to de-
fe nd him elf and captu re game, but 
he is not prone to the kind of de-
structiveness [ofmodem warfare I." 

RALLY: Leader 
call for student action 
to top budget cuts 
Continued from page 3 

Andres agreed. "Governor Wil-
son i sending a message that he 'd 
rather have us behind bars than in 
our school . It cost more to put 
'omebody in jail than to send them 
to a UC school. That shows exactly 
where their priorities are and what 
the government really thinks about 
people our age," he said. 

Urging action on behalf of the' 
students, SODA member and War-
ren College senior Ely Rabani tried 
to persuade rallygoers that the na-
tional economy was not to blame. 

"One myth we've got to under-
mine here is that the economy is 
falling apan. That's bullshit. That 's 
whatthey want us to believe. (t's not 
the national. debt or global reces-
sion; it's policy. The federal gov-
ernment has got to get themselves 
together for the people - not for the 
economy, not for the rich, but for 
us," Rabani said. 

Rabani also commented on the 
uselessness of the Recreational and 
Intramural Athletic Center 
(RIMAC), saying that its construe-

Profwuor Robert Uvlnpton 
dultne his Friday evening lecture. 

Livingston has reason to be con-
cerned about the global . iruation. 
He has been involved in peace ef-
forts since age 15. 

As a medical officer in Okinawa 
during World War II, Livingston 
heard of the first atomic bomb drop 
over his rad io. At that time, 
Livingston aid he knew nothing 
could stop scientists and politicians 
from pursuing nuclear weaponry. 

Hi concern over the po ibility 
of nuclear war wa also influenced 
by his frie nd Leo Szilard, who had 
patent rights to the nuclear chain 
reaclion and asked Alben Einstein 

tion will only PUI sludent at a fur-
ther disadvantage. 

In addition to the 20 percent fee 
increa e. another$210 per year will 
be asses ed from UCSD tudcnts 
for rhe building of RIMAe. This 
will bring the cost of a UCSD edu-
ca tion to almost $5.7 1 0 for 1993-94 
if the fee hikes occur. Rabani urged 
student to sign a petition that would 
place the question on the ballot that 
may halt the building of the sports 
complex. • 

·'RIMAC i an inappropriate 
lUXUry item .. . sure the place could 
use more athletics, but not at a time 
like this, at that kind of a cost," 
Rabani said. 

Third College junior Sylvie 
Curran said that "this is omething 
that the entire university - the stu-
dent body - has to unite [around]. 
We have power in numbers. It 's 
time to make the legislature and the 
governor responsible to us." 

Curran also encouraged campus 
groups and orgartizations to end a 
representative to SODA, a coalition 
of student organizations that is dedi-
cated to uniting students on relevant 
issues and is working to fight the fee 
increases and oppo e the building 
ofRIMAC.

Living ton his watch. Living ton 
said it was not meant merely to keep 
track of lime. but al 0 as a symbol 
that Livingston should keep watch 
over the nuclear threat. 

Living ton said the threat of glo-
bal annihilation has not di minished 
' ince the collap. e of the Soviet 
Union. Recently, a fomler KGB 
geneml publicly offered weapons-
grdde plutonium for sale in Europe. 

Living ton said that the nuclear 
weapons currently poised for attack 
amount to 35,000 tons of TNT for 
every person on earth. " It is uncon-
scionable that humans tolerate (his 
risk," he said. 

"The capacity for genuine toler-
ance. empathy and compassion must 
be tolerated universally in a time 
table that i very hort ... If we don 't 
[develop thi capacityl , we have a 
very small ehance for survival." 
Livingston said.

"I don 'tthink that the majority of 
taxpayers in this state really want to 
deny the opportunity of public higher 
education to the next genemti n. But 
Ido believe that if we want toprolecl 
and repleni h our publ ic universi -

case to the taxpayers nnd the state 
legislature ourse lves, because no-
body is going to do it for us." 

Hahn urged students to join the 
Coalition for Higher Education, an 
organization of tudents, faculty and 
staff that considers particular issues 
of imponance to the university. 

Wilson ended the rally with 
strong encouragement for action. 
"We're talking about people power; 
thatreaJly means something indefi-
nite terms, it's not just a rhetorical 
concept. You have to do something 
active in order to make the rhetoric 
become real decision making."

An Israeli Soldier's Stoty 
B Y D A V I D S NOW. 

• Before he could 

take his U1i.rd 

College classes in 

cultural awareness, 

Amit Shamis' native 

Israel required him 

to participate for 

three years in one of 

the world's most 

bitter cultural 

conflicts. 

"H Molotov cocktail i a glass 
container with gasoline or 
any explosive liquid in it," 
explains Third College 
junior Amit Shami . 'The 

rag [which i tu f feddown the bottle's 
neck) is lit, and then the boule is 
thrown. The flames spread all over 
like Iiquid," he says. Sham is is knowl-
edgeable about MololOv 
cocktails not because he has 
strange hobbie ,but because 
angry crowd have tried to 
kill him with them. 

A few years ago, Shami 
was a soldier in the I sraeli 
Defense Force (IDF). and 
thus fulfilled hi duty as a 
citizen of that country by giv-
ing up36consecutivemonths 
to se.rvice in its military. 

Under I sraeli law, all cit i -
zens muSI serve in Ihe IDF, 
men for a term of three years, 
and women for 22 
months. Only onhodox Jews 
who are committed to full-
time study of sctipture are 
exempt • 

Shamis, who entered the 
IDF when he turned 18 and a 
half in 1987, says that his experiences 
as a soldier in one of the world's most 
politically volalile areas gave him a 
perspective on war and on life that he 
could nOl have achieved any other

way. 
" Being in Ihe am1Y made me ap· 

preciate life and underSland that ev-
erything we do in life has a price tag 
on it." says Sham is. 
Fire Zone 

H is ba ic training con isted oftwo 
months of rigorous exercise and only 
three hours of sleep a night. It takes 
orne trainees more than seven months 

to get through Ihe ordeal. The single 
purpose of Ihis punishing trial, ex-
plains Sham is, is to "prepare you to 
defend your country 24 hours a day, 
and also to mold you to fit army 
characlerist ics." 

Shamis was fin stationed in war-
10m Lebanon. "r w as on guard duty in 
Lebanon, using light shells to lig hl up 
the whole area, and using cannons to 
shell the area," he remembers. " The 
Lebane e pay c ivilians to fire rockets 
at Israel. Every day people tried to 
cross the border there, with the goal of 
taking Israelis as ho tages or killing 
them. I kept thinking that il would end 
oon, but it would last three years for 

me. In battle, the concept of being 
al ive is much more appreciated." 

Whi Ie stationed i,n Lebanon, 
Shamis had a dangerous and tragic 
experience that fostered his distaste 
for what he describes as "extremists 
on both sides." One day, he crossed 
the border into Lebanon in a convoy 
of three jeeps. As he climbed o ut of

UCSD Greeks tty to rehab themselves and their image. S2 



2 Tuesday, January 19, 1993 

I TWAS StlAPlNG UPTO BEA HaL OF A N1GtIT FOR Third College junior Frank Walter. The tune were turned up loud, the ud were ample, and he was still talking with the incredible woman he had met a half hour 
before. The two of them were hitting it off 
well, and the conversation tayed fre h and 
exciting. 

They were having u hacooltime thatlhe 
woman didn't not i e Walter' s fraternity 
pledge pin until just then. She went ballistic at 
the sight of the Sigma Alpha Ep ilon trinket, 
ailing into a windy indictmem of Walter as 

[I pelly, classless jerk for being involved in the 
Greek system at all, and a exi t drunken 
slimeball for his affiliation with the particular 
chapter whose allegedly pornographic in-
house fl yers ruffled local feathers last year. 

Stunned by the unprovoked verbal blitz-
krieg. Walter pa sionately explained that he 
and his Greek brothers and sisters really 
aren' t all rowdy, violent, mindle s, hard-
drinking. 'el(-crazed snob. He even tried to 
mention that beside the parties, there were 
plenty of character-building, philanthropic, 
and yes, even scholarship-promoting activi-
ties which he enjoyed as a Greek. 

But Walter would convince no one that 
night. It was apparent that this panicular 
w man. along with about everyone else in the 
non-Greek population. wa n't aware of, or 
ready t a cept,thenewandimprovingGreeks 
of the nineties. 

The hard truth, according 10 Pi Beta Phi 
member Kari Anne Storti , vice president of 
communications for the UCSD Panhellenic 
Counci l, is that "everyone is corning around 
to the view that it' s not just about a party 
anymore. Sororities and fraternities, on our 
campus at least, really try to promote philan-
thropy and high scholast ic achievement. lead-
ership is a big part of why you join, and 
there's a great opportunity for development 
in that area." 

Walter, for one, couldn't be happier that 
the old Allimal House stereotype is finall y 
being put 10 rest. "Some people make a ' -
umptions without having any knowledge to 

base their judgements on. It bums me out," he 
~ays . 001 don' t like being cia sified. I'm not 
just a Greek or an SAEjust because I'm in an 
organization. I'm till who I am." 

Still, the fire-and-forget Greek life tyle 
ponr.lyed in the popular movie has remained 
such a powerful image Ihat its celluloid she-
nanigans have gelled inlo Ihe public con-
sciousness. 

"People think that we ' re just buying 
friends, and it' s just partying and sex. and 
that 's it. Thai's preny much how it is in the 
movies and in Ihe media," say Third College 
sophomore Nicole Wohland of Alpha Chi 
Omega. She emphasizes that being the war-
den for her sorority and accepting the re pon-

• UCSD's fraternities and sororities, who say the degrading movie myths are 
wrong, are ready to rehabilitate themselves and their image. 

ibility that c mes wi th Ihe office has 
given a valuable boo t to her self-image. 

"Everybody has Iheirown responsibil-
iry. I f rhey're not in anoffiee, everybody's 
in a ommitree, and they're assigned by 
their commirtee leaders to have responsi-
bilities," Wohland explains. 

HI think leadership is one of the main 
things. There's people who are in charge 
of songs. there' people who are in charge 
of rituals. there's people who are in charge 
of this, there's people who are in charge of 
Ihat, and il does spread a lot of the respon-
sibility around. So I think that 's a very 
good ide to Greek life," says Wohland. 

It 's a side which, along with many 
others. ha been largely overlooked by the 
rest of the world. For years now, this fact 
has been the Greek' tirele sly repeated 
mantra. Paul De Wine, advisor to the UCSD 
Greeks, privately believes that the Greek 
system is singled out for pecial punish-
ment by the media. "I think Ihat all the 
facts aren't known and they 're portrayed 
inaccurately. TIle media sometimes pro-
mote some of Ihe tereotype of Greeks, 
and ometimes Ihe Greeks deserve critical 
coverage, other times they don 't. [ Ihink 
that the media tries to focus on sen at ion-
alism and negative reporting. When it's 
acc ur.l!e, iI's de erved. When it's not. it's 
unfortunate." he laments. 

Lasl February, SAEmembers formally 
apologized after Ihe contents of their chap-
tercalendar were publicized in theGllard-
iall . The controversial calendar di played 
a drawing of a naked woman with a 
monsler' s fanged mouth between her 
pread legs, accompan ied by a lewd phrase 

Ihat warned men to use a condom. 
DeWinedoe n'tbelievethattherecent 

candals here and at other Greek chapter 

acros the country have dramatically af-
fec[ed recru ilmen!. Though he admit that 
Ihe number of siurient rushing UCSD 
chapters has at best held leady during 
recent years. he contends thai the leveling 
off of inlerest in Greek life has linle to do

"We started Greek Orienlation thi 
year. which i a full day of seminars that 

. new Greeks attend:' enthu e ' Muir junior 
Kirt Wilson, as i tant vi e-president ad-
ministrative of the UCSD [Fe. "It deals 
with a 101 of real-life is~ue like depres-
sion, alcohol, substance abuse, date rape, 
racial diversity and scholastic kill . And 
we've just entered into a o-op agreement 
with Kaplan to give seminars on entering 
grad school. 

"So we're trying 10 provide this 10 
people new in the Greek system so they' ll 
have these tools. I'd say a fair amount of 
the message is getting through, Certainly 
more and more. We're always working on 
that, It's difficult for any organization to 
fOSlerthat agenda on an ongoing basis, but 
we're not just putting it out there and 
saying Either they get il r they don ' I. I 
don' t feel it's ju t lip ervice:' ays Wil-
son. 

Though the new program may seem 
to be a half-hearted altempt at belated 
dannage control, the Greeks maimain Ihal 
they honestly intend to reform their be-
havior, and aren't worried at all about 
their image. 

" I don' t think that the ~ystem changed 
because of what people Ihought," Storti 
asserts, "[ think they changed imply be-
cause it wasn '[ what their organization 
was founded on. They wanted to return to 
the way that it was meant to be. They took 
a slep toward returning their organiza-
tions 10 their original philosophies, which 
were to include doing charity work. and 
promoting scholastic achievement." 

Community service projects, or "phi-
lanthropies" as the Greek tudents refer 10 
them, are a regular part of Greek life. 
Some members proudly estimate that char-
ity work accounts for as much as 30 per-
cent of all activities, depending on the 
chapter. 

A few of the charitable endeavors seem 
decidedly unappealing, uch as highway 
liner-removal duty, which SAE regularly 
penonns. Most volunteer work is more 
charm:ng. One member of Sigma Chi 
reports that since he ru hed last Septem-
ber, he has participated in Ihree different 
charity projects, includinga pumpkin drive 
for the YMCA and tutoring Iinle kids at 
local schools. "We've done a lot of totally 
cool stuff," he says. 
. While the cynical observer might poo-
pootheirefforts, theGreeksseem to unani-
mously insist that their contributions are 
not only valuable, but sincere. 

"The most overwhelming anitude 
among my sisters when it comes time for

ally they're really interesting and really

Why? 
Because over 40 million Americans are affected with a sexually transmitted disease, 
otherwise known as an STD. Over three million are affected with GENITAL WARTS, 

NCRC of San Diego is conducting a clinical research study on a new treatment for 
external genital wans. 

Qualified volunteers will receive free medical attention which includes: 

• a free medical evaluation 

• free laboratory tests. including 
a PAP smear and lUV testing 

• free study medication.

fun. You learn a lot," Storti says. 
Misconceptions aboutthetypical Greek 

tudent are so ingrained in popularcuhure 
that members have all but given up on 
dreaming of their image ever being fully 
rehabilitated. ("We don't really talk about 
the stereotype anymore, it's just annoy-
ing," reports Walter.) Yet they will none-
theless jump at the chance to do what they 
can to correct the old preju-
dices. 

"I don'l think thai 
Greeks are heavier drink-
ers than non-Greek ," 
Waller says. 'There are a 
lot of different fraternities 
and none of them are total 
beer hounds. In my frater-
nity we do have parties, but 
it's nOI every day. I sil and 
I see people alone in my 
suite, those that are Greek 
and those Ihat aren't , 
pounding away ju t a 
much as anyone else. [ 
haven't partied in a while. 
I'm too busy studying." 

Wilson adds Ihat sex-
ism is no more prevalent 
inside the Greek system 
than it is anywhere else. "I 
could point out to you very 
sexist Greeks, and I could 
point out very non-sexist 
Greeks at Ihe same time. I feel that the 
Greeks, because of their organization and 
resources, have the responsibility to not 
only keep up with society, but actually to 
be more progressive than society. [ don 't 
think we always live up to that, but it's 
something we're working towards." 

A particularly vicious label which has 
been pinned 10 Greeks is that they are 
morons or ditses. Wilson dismisses that 
claim by pointing out that the average 
GPA of the nearly 2000 Greek UCSD 
students, "for whatever reason," is higher 
than the campus average. 

Muirsenior Samantha Ofheroff, presi-
dem of Alpha Chi Omega. is one of those 
reasons. "Personally, I'm now in the hon-
ors program, and I think that the position 
that I'm in has pushed me into a level 
where I have to deal with more types of 
worldly issues. In my sorority ,I know that 
about half of our members are biology 
majors, and quite of few of them are 
double majors, in ~ubjects like engineer-
ing and anthropology. So I coold never 
say that we're less intellectual. 

"After all," Ofheroff says, "we're all 
here to learn and mature, not just in scho-
lastic ways, but so we can deal with what 
we would like to do later on in our lives."

of the edan pu hed a button thaI detonated a 
huge payload of explo ives in the car. killing 
himself and all the r raeH ·oldiers till in the 
jeeps. 

The e plosion ~eft a three-foot deep and 
five-foot wide hole in the road. "If I hadn 't 
jumped out of that jeep. I wouldn't be here now 
to tell you thi :. ay Shami . "I was two ec-
onds from death. It really makes you think what 
this life i all about." 

Shami i till haunted by some of the gri Iy 
acts hehadtoperfonn inordertopr tecth im elf 
and hi platoon. while he was platoon sergeant 
in the controversial and violent Gaza trip, a 
largely Pale tinian area which is occupied by 
I rael. "I aw a Palestinian boy, somewhere 
between 12 and 14 years old, with a Molotov 
cocktail. In the 1 raeli army. you can only fue 
li ve ammunition if the commanding officers 
know that you are in a life or death situation. A 
this was the present case. I shor the boy in the 
back with a rubber bullet. 

"After he was shot, the Palestinians held him 
up and twirled him aroUnd as though he were a 
saint. They danced with him for about 20 min-
utes as a fountain of blood came out of him. I 
heard later that he died. Reflecting on this event, 
I can only say that I do not understand why I 
killed him or why he died." 
Mella ....... 

According to Sham is. the American under-
standing of the Arab-Israeli conflict is haped 
by media reports which are often inaccurate and 
incomplete. He expla ins that the level of vio-
lence within Israel's borders is relatively low. 
"Los Angeles is probably much more oanger-
ous than Israel," he explains. 

"The media only shows the Israelis fighting 
against the Palestinians, but they don't how the 
Palestinians starting it. Therefore. they don 't 
fully explain the ituation." 

He says that the media often wrongly por-
trays the Israeli army as ruthless, especially in 
relation to the people living in Gaza. The cover-
age, he says, has developed the public percep-
tion of the conflict as a "black and white itua-
tion. Actually, the standard of living has im-
proved in these areas," says Sham is. 

'The media only shows what is of interest to 
people here, that is, clashes between Israelis and 
Arabs rather than everyday life," says Sham is. 
'This leads Americans to p;:rceive Israel as a 
very violent place. The Gaza strip has a great 
deal of crime and poverty, and the people living 
there are in refugee camps. They need to find a 
pennanent home. The 10rdinians don't want 
this responsibility, nor do the Egyptians." 

Bom in the United States, Shamis became an 
Israeli citizen when his family relocated there. 
Israel offers automatic citizenship to any person 
of Judaic heritage. He later attended high school 
in the city of Herzelya. 

The crisis in the Middle East is often de-

scribed in tenns of ideological and religious 
differences between the mostly Jewish state of 
lsrael and their Muslim neighbors. However, 
Shamis feels that religion plays a minimal role 
in the functioning of the IDF. The defense of 

Israel, he says, "has nothing to do with a holy 
war," 

Although women are allowed in the IDF, 
they are mostly relegated to desk jobs. "lsraelis 
are not sexist." he says. "What you must under-

Now studying at UCSD. Shamis says most 
people who find out thllJ he served in the IDF are 
often overwhe lmed and admire him. becau~e 
the United States does !:lot have such stringent 
laws of military ·ervice. nor do its soldiers know 
they wi ll immediately face such a protracted 
threat. He adds that many employers look favor-
ably on hi experience because of the discipline 
and commit1l1ent it has taught him. 

" I am glad I did it because it helped make me 
the person I am today." he says. "I was much 
more spoiled before being in the amly. It took 
me seven months to understand that I Wal>

Even the most a,tute Middle Ea~t ~holars 
cannot predict when the hostilities will end. but 
they 'Seem to ag ree with Shamis that "people 
need to talk." 

"Some people are unrealistic 011 both sides." 
Sham is adds. 'This cannot go on forever. 111ere 
is always the factor of hate - there is a lot of 
fundamentalism on be:h sides." 

Only the handful of other fonmer IDF sol-
diers at UCSD can relate to Sham is 's experi-
ence. "We share a common language. A friend 
once told me that if we managed to survive this. 
we can withstand whatever comes in our path. 
No finals week is as difficult as what we have

UCSD Squashes 
Slugs, then Bests 
Bethany on Road 
NCIIIHERN CALIOIIM 1RF: UCSD handles UC 
Santa Cruz, 73-62 on Friday then escapes 99-96 at 
Bethany as Moore lights up scoreboanl with 41 points 
ByG .... Wrenn 
Sports Editor 

After a rough start to the season, the 
UCSD men' :':.:sketball team seems to 
have gotten on track for a run at another 
NCAA tournament bid. 

The Tri-
tons visited 
Northern 
California 
this weekend 
for games at 
UC Santa 
Cruz on Fri-
day and 
Bethany Col-
lege on Sat-
urday. For 
UCSD,itwas 
worth the trip, 
wiMingboth 

contests - 73-62 over Santa Cruz and 
99-96 at Bethany. 

At Santa Cruz, the Tritons had linle 
trouble neutralizing the Banana Slugs' 
main weapon, their perimeter hooting. 
"I was really pJeased with the way our 
defense played. It was exceptional and 
we were able to take them out of the 
thing they wanted to do," UCSD Head 
Coach Tom Marshall said 

UCSD jumped out to a comfortable 
II-point lead 32-21 , at halftime and 
then extended the margin to 16 in the 

second half before Santa Cruz began 
fighting back. The Slugs climbed b1ck 
to within ix before the Tritons shoved 
back and finished off the gastropods. 

'We controlled most of the game,

nities to put it away," Marshall said. 

Chris Moore led the team with 25 
points on eight of 14 shooting, while 
John Spence added 16 of his own. Andy 
Swindall haw seven rebounds to spear-
head the Tritons 37 -30 advantage on the 
boards. 

It was a wild Saturday night for 
UCSD, corning from behind in the flllal 
minutes to beat Bethany in the fast-
paced conte t. ''That was a real 
shw toul," Marshall said "We both had 
our guns out and were firing it up." 

Hring it up are the right words for it , 
considering the Tritons shot 67 percent 
from the field. Terry Hick, Bethany's 
6-8 center, ran roughshod over UCSD, 
totaling 43 points tram all overthe floor. 
"[Hicks] could play any position he 
wants. He was hining so many threes, a 
101 of them ITom pastNBArange, it was 
ridiculous. He's a really fine player," 
Marshall said. 

Moore was not to be outdone how-
ever, bwning Bethany for41.

The UCSD ice hockey team played 
sparlcling defense and full-throttle of-
fense over the weekend, en route to a 
two-game sweep of SI. Mary's College. 

On Friday night at the Sports Arena, 
UCSD potted SI. Mary's a one-goal 
lead befo~ scoring seven unanswered 
goals in a 7-1 victory. 

Ervin Vallero spurTed the Triton 
offensive attack early on with two goals

period. 

With just over 10 minutes remain-

ingin the period, Vallerotipped inashOl 
by K.C. Joy, past Gael goaltender John 
Slonaker 10 tie the score at one. 

Vallero notched his second score of 
the night just 30 seconds later, as he 
stood all alone in front of the St Mary's 
goal with the puck. He promptly rifled 
a backhand up and over the glove hand 
of Slonaker to give UCSD the 2-1 
advantage. 

John Kelly rounded out the scoring 
in the ftrst period as he jammed in a pass 
from Leigh Hsu on the stick side of the

second period. Jim McLeod banged in 
a rebound with 10:42 remaining in the

Is Johnson's

Let the hype begin. As the nation

over the world: What d Jimmy

With their 29-10 thrashing of the 
Miami Dolphin in the AFC Otampi-
onship game, the Buffalo Bills became 
only the second team to make three 
consecutive Super Bowl appearances. 
With a defeat in this year's game, the 
Bill would become the only team to 
"three-peat" as Super Bowl losers. 
Even the Denver Bronco had the good 
sense to miss the playoff in '89 after 
two slrJight humiliations. 

Remember the heartbreaking end to 
Super Bowl XXV? Had Scott 

arwood's kick h 'edjust two feet, 
he'd still have ajob and the AFC' 
Super Bowl : ,,~:i1g streak would have 
been stopped at ix. Instead, 

OIW ':, working the gmveyard shift 
at Circle K, and the AFC seems headed 
for another bloody car crash, thi time 
in Pasadena. 

It' too b:ld the Dolphins didn't 
make it to the Super Bowl ulis year. 
Such at) appearance would have been 
Don Shula's eighth as a head coo h. It 
would have been the fourth decade 
(,60s, '70s, '80s. '90s) for a Shu la-
coached team to make the Super Bowl. 
In seven appearances (two with 
Baltimore, five with Miami), Shula's

DJllas will be making a record sixth 
Super Bowl appeamnce. Once upon a 
time, the Cowboys were a fIXture in 
football's world champion hip game. 
From 1971-79, DJllas played in the 
Super Bowl five times, winning twice. 

It 's hard to believe that 14 years 
have passed since "Big D" last played 
in the Super Bowl. So much has 
changed in DJllas since their 35-31 loss 
to Pinsburgh in Super Bowl XIIl 
Much like the Steve Young-Joe 
Monlat1a soap opem in Sat) Fmncisco, 
Danny White was never able to escape 
the shadow of his illustriou predeces-

the Cowboys began to lide. and living

1989. 

The Jerry Jones-Jimmy Johnson era 
in Dallas t~uted slowly, as the Cowboy 
fell to 1-15 in 1989. Yet a tunningrevival 
has vaulted the Cowboys to the top of the

. It was a Royal humiliation, indeed. The UCSD 
women 's basketball team destroyed the hapl 
Pa iii Chri tian Royals, 87-34, in Fullerton on 

Friday evening. The 53-
point margin of victory is 
the Iarg t for UCSD since 
a 77 -point demolition of 
California Lutheran last 
February. 

"We expected to win 
handily; \ thought we'd bea1 
them by 20 or so. I cer-
tainly wasn't expecting to 
win this big," UCSD Head 
Coach Judy Malone said. 

The game stayed com-
petitive until midway 
through the first half, as the 

Tritons led by only ix, 20-14. UCSD's perimeter 
game struggled' early, so the Tritons hifted to a 
one-dimensional offensive anack named Erica 
Scholl. 

Scholl simply posted-up her hOlter Pacific 
Chri tian counterpart, caught the entry passe , 
spun and fired Scholl's teadiness in the post 
provided ahno t all of UCSD' offense in the 
opening 10 minutes. "Erica probably scored our 
first 20 points. We just kept pounding it inside," 
Malone said. Scholl went on to lead all scorers with 
29 points and 12 rebounds. 

Although UCSD enjoyed clear advantages 
over the smaller, slower Pacific Christian club, the 
Tritons were playing listless. uninspired basket-
ball. The defense lacked inten ity, and the offense 
was relying too heavily on Scholl.

Erica SchoI had 29 points and 12 rebounds. 

Needing a spark, Malone put in 5-8 guard,!
