Gov. Declares State Fiscal Crisis EMPLOYEE 
SEVERANCE 

PACKAGE
UNDER FIRE
By Sarah de Crescenzo
Senior Staff Writer

A voluntary employee buyout 
program initiated by the UC Office 
of the President in an effort to reduce 
university spending recently became 
a subject of con-
troversy, when a 
severance pack-
age amounting 
to $100,202 for 
a former UC 
administrator 
was approved by 
the UC Board of 
Regents.

L i n d a 
Williams, after 
receiving a larger payout than any of 
the other 155 UCOP employees who 
had previously taken advantage of the 
Voluntary Severance Program, was 
hired on May 1 to work under UC 
Berkeley Chancellor Robert J. Birgeneau 
as associate chancellor for government, 
community and campus liaison.

Though the Voluntary Separation 
Program requires participants who 
rejoin UCOP within a specified time 
period to return part or all of their 
severance packages, those who retain 
employment elsewhere in the UC 
system, like Williams, hold no such 
obligation.

In response to California’s current 
$11.2 billion revenue shortfall, Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a fis-
cal emergency Monday, calling state 
lawmakers to a special session and 
pressing them to approve his proposed 
$4.5 billion in midyear cuts, including 
$65.5 million from the University of 
California’s operating budget.

The state may run out of cash as 
soon as February, and the state budget 
deficit could reach $28 billion over 
the next 18 months, according to the 
California Legislative Analyst’s Office. 

“Without immediate action, our 
state is headed for a fiscal disaster,” 
Schwarzenegger said in a statement.

Proposition 58, passed in 2004, 
requires lawmakers to pass legislation 
addressing a fiscal crisis within 45 
days, and prohibits legislators from 
adjourning their special session or act-
ing on any unrelated bills until they 
tackle the budget problem.

H.D. Palmer, deputy director of 
external affairs with the California 
Department of Finance, said the pro-
posed cuts will be difficult to make, but 
that if the Legislature waits longer than 
45 days to act, it will face a shortfall 
$1.5 billion to $2 billion greater than 
that already in existance.

“The longer you wait, the tougher 
the decisions are going to get,” he said. 
“In this case, time is literally money.” See CRISIS, page 2

UC Reinstates Abroad Program in Israel

By Heather Houry
Contributing Writer

The University of California announced  last 
week it would reopen its study-abroad program 
in Israel, lifting a ban placed on the program in 
2002 following the U.S. Department of State’s 
placement of the Middle Eastern country on its 
travel-warning list.

The university is currently engaged in discus-
sions with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem 
at the Rothberg International School regarding 
the reimplementation of the program, slating 
to begin enrollment in Summer 2009 for Fall 
Quarter of that year.

“In today’s richly interconnected global 
economy, a study-abroad program at Hebrew 
University of Jerusalem would provide a unique 

academic and cultural opportunity for UC stu-
dents,” said UC Education Abroad Program 
acting Executive Director Michael Cowan in a 
statement. “UC once again will be connected 
to a leading higher education institution in 
Israel and is continuing to provide international 
opportunities to students.”

UC policy prohibits the university from 
sponsoring education-abroad programs in any 
country listed on the Department of State trav-
el-warning list. 

In March 2006, after vocal student protest 
to the policy, the UC Board of Regents asked a 
special committee to examine the university’s 
position regarding education-abroad programs, 
particularly in countries where the Department 
of State had issued danger advisories. 

In August of this year, university officials 
directed an ad hoc working group to determine 
whether re-establishing education abroad in 
Israel was a good idea. After reviewing the 
security risks associated with the program, the 
group concluded that the university could make 
an exception to its policy. The regents then 

Though the U.S. government 
still lists the region as a risky 
travel destination, students will 
soon be able to study at a 
premier Israeli college.

UCSD will be the first stop of 
the Student Regent Recruitment 
Tour this Friday. 

UCLA student Regent 
D’Artagnan Scorza and UC Santa 
Barbara student Regent-designate 
Jesse Bernal will stop at each of 
the 10 UC campuses to meet with 
students and administrators to 
recruit the next student regent to 
serve on the UC Board of Regents 
and discuss the application pro-
cess as well as student issues 
with students and administrators. 

The tour will end at UCLA on 
Feb. 19. 

One student regent serves 
every year on the 26-member UC 
Board of Regents, the body that 
under Article IX, Section 9 of the 
California Constitution has “full 

powers of organization and gover-
nance” over the university, subject 
only to very specific areas of leg-
islative control. 

A position created in 1975, the 
student regent’s role on the board 
is to directly represent the needs 
of students and voice concerns 
about issues most affecting stu-
dents such as tuition, diversity 
and sustainability practices. 

The first year of the student 
regent’s two-year term on the 
board is spent as a nonvoting 
“regent designate” before assum-
ing full voting membership the 
following year. 

The student regent spends 
both years attending all regents’ 
meetings, which occur six times 
a year every other month and last 
for two days.

The deadline for applying to 
become the 2010-11 student 
regent is Feb. 19, 2009.

POORLY DRAWN LINES  BY REZA FARAZMAND

result in larger class sizes and a smaller 
number of tenured faculty positions, 
ultimately impacting the quality of 
education for UC students.

At the UC Board of Regents meeting 
Nov. 18 through 20, UCSD Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox was one of three 
chancellors to outline the detrimen-
tal impacts the state funding shortfall 
will have on UC campuses, announc-
ing that the famed Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography is in a “precarious 
position.”

On Nov. 20, the regents approved a 
proposed 2009-10 budget that relies on 
a $755 million increase in state fund-
ing. They announced plans to curtail 
freshman enrollment next fall if the 
state does not meet their request.

While many regents opposed the 
budget, assuming it would be reject-
ed by the Legislature, Yudof said the 

university must present an ambitious 
initial request that reflects its realistic 
needs.

“It’s a reality test,” he said. “It might 
be pie in the sky, but our job is to force-
fully articulate what we need. We’re 
being honest about what it takes to 
maintain this great institution.”

The governor will release his pro-
posed 2009-10 budget in January, and 
UC spokesman Ricardo Vazquez said 
the regents will re-evaluate their pro-
posed budget at their February meet-
ing.

To help compensate for the state 
budget gap, the governor is also pro-
posing $4.7 billion in revenue increas-
es, including a statewide sales tax hike 
— from 7.25 to 8.75 percent — that 
would last three years.

The last A.S. meeting of the quarter was a short and rela-tively sweet affair that com-
menced two hours earlier than usual 
and ended shortly after the last traces 
of daylight faded from the sky.

A.S. Speaker Jordan Taylor could 
not be present for the meeting due to 
a class conflict with the rescheduled 
time, so Revelle College Chair James 
Lintern mediated the meeting.

John Muir College Freshman 
Representative Frank Chang brought 
in a little present for the council in 
the form of a pot-
ted plant, wishing 
members the best 
of luck for the rest 
of the year.

D u r i n g 
reports, several 
councilmembers 
praised the upcoming activity fee ref-
erendum display, compliments of the 
A.S. Graphics Studio, which is located 
in what President Donna Bean called 
the “yellow epilepsy tunnel” linking 
Price Center and Price Center East.

“As the Special Election Manger, 
I’m telling you that if you haven’t 
done so already to go downstairs in 
Price Center, walk through the big 
yellow hallway and look at the glorious 
display for the referendum that has 
been set up,” Associate Vice President 
of Student Advocacy Frank Carroll 
said.

Associate Vice President of Athletic 
Relations Peter Benesch plugged the 
Triton Tide tailgating event for the first 
basketball home game of the season 
on Friday, and his announcement was 
followed by Associate Vice President 
of Programming Garrett Berg’s pre-
sentation regarding the TGIO event 
also taking place on Friday.

 “We have inflatables, free food and 
really loud live music.” Berg said.  

Berg ended his report with a 

reminder that the Sun God Student 
Forum that will take place Thursday.

Sixth College Senator Vishal 
Kotcherlakota announced his resig-
nation and introduced Diane Liu to 
the council as his successor.

A survey was then circulat-
ed around the room, which Vice 
President of Student Life Darryl 
Nousome explained to the council 
assesses students’ response to the pos-
sibility of having a test-prep office 
and an Associated Students store on 
campus.

To lighten the 
mood, Revelle 
College Senator 
Katie Hall jokingly 
inquired about her 
colleague, fellow 
Revelle Senator 
Brian Yum, ask-

ing how he procured his newly gold-
en-tinged locks before shifting gears 
to remind the council of the A.S. 
Pancake Breakfast on Dec. 8 at 10 p.m.  
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox will be 
a special guest serving the late-night 
breakfast goodies to students.

During the meeting’s new business 
portion, Vice President of Finance 
Naasir Lakhani moved to approve the 
allocations for Winter Quarter, which 
proved to be a complicated feat at 
this laid-back meeting because of the 
council’s concerns with the current 
financial situation.

After discussing the InterFraternity 
Council’s funding request for some 
time, Lahkani’s motion was approved 
and the council moved on to a five-
minute open forum.

The meeting was ended after one 
hour so that councilmembers could 
attend the UC Student Association-led 
training on how to effectively run a 
referendum campaign for the activity 
fee mandate that will be put to stu-
dents in January.

decided to reinstate the program, 
provided its proceedings be closely 
monitored.

UC spokesman Chris Harrington 
said the university will survey politi-
cal activity in Israel to ensure that 
students remain safe. 

“We have a number of tools to gain 
intelligence in specific countries,” he 
said. “We will be able to ascertain the 
political and social climate in order to 
ensure safety and security.”

The Hebrew University is Israel’s 
first institute of higher education and 
is comprised of students from over 
50 countries. All those participat-
ing in the University of California’s 
Education Abroad Program in Israel 
will be required to take a summer 
course in modern Hebrew, followed 
by a semester or year enrolled at 
Hebrew University.

Participating students will still 
be subject to strict regulations while 
abroad. According to the State 
Department, American travelers have 
been subject to interrogation and 
thorough searches by Israeli authori-
ties upon entering or departing the 
country.

Travelers with Arabic last names, 
unaccompanied females and those 
who request that their passport not 
be stamped have often been delayed, 
experiencing particularly close scru-
tiny by border enforcement.

Cowan is now negotiating terms 
for the full implementation of the 
study-abroad program in Israel, and 
information about the application 
process will be made available at a 
later date.

“I find it reprehensible that the UC 
administration continues to let these 
sweetheart deals go through,” state 
Sen. Leland Yee (D-San Francisco/
San Mateo) said. “At the same time 
we are asking students to tighten 
their belts, the administrators can 
still live high on the hog.” 

A formula taking into account each 
employee’s current salary and number 
of years at UCOP is used to determine 
the size of each 
particular buyout 
package. Hayward 
said Williams 
should not be sub-
ject to reprimand 
for the generous 
size of her sever-
ance package.

“ E m p l o y e e s 
are in no way at 
fault for accept-
ing an offer that 
we made them,” 
Hayward said. 
“The amount of 
the buyouts is far outweighed by the 
administrational savings that we have 
on an ongoing basis.” 

As campuses throughout the UC 
system debate raising undergradu-
ate tuition and accepting fewer stu-
dents in coming years in an effort to 
compensate for a troubling lack of 
state funding, many view buyouts like 
Williams’ as a double standard.

“[The UC Board of Regents] 
should be a lot more sensitive to stu-
dents when they approve these sweet-
heart contracts,” Yee said. “These 
kinds of severance packages are a 
slap in the face to our students. You 
wonder about what kind of role mod-
els the adults making these decisions 
want to be for our students.”

The UCOP buyout program was 

initiated by the university a year ago 
in an effort to reduce the office’s 
expenditures by cutting back on labor, 
which included a limited number of 
layoffs, in addition to the voluntary 
departure of those in the program. 

“The Voluntary Separation 
Program, a one-time program which is 
now over, was a buyout program that 
essentially said to employees that if 
they would like to leave the University 
of California Office of the President, 

they could do 
this and receive a 
financial buyout 
for doing so,” UC 
spokesman Brad 
Hayward said.

UCOP esti-
mates that  the 
V o l u n t a r y 
S e p a r a t i o n 
Program has 
saved the univer-
sity $5 million 
after one year, and 
that its total cost-
reduction efforts 

will account for overall savings of 
$30 million. 

“There’s been a good deal of dif-
ferent consolidation of activities at 
UCOP,” Hayward said. “For example, 
we took the business processing unit 
of each department and centralized 
these operations into smaller units 
that serve the entire office.” 

Lee said further open discussion 
is needed to reduce controversy over 
buyout packages such as Williams’. 

“What should happen is a lot more 
deliberation about these particular 
contracts,” he said. “They happen in 
the dark of night and there’s no public 
conversation about it.”

OPINIONCONTACT THE EDITORopinion@ucsdguardian.org

The University of California is the nation’s most prestigious public university, enrolling 
thousands of the best and brightest 
Californians and even attracting stu-
dents who hail from well beyond our 
state borders, for good reason — cut-
ting-edge research programs and 
top-notch faculty combined with the 
affordability allowed within a public 
system make UC campuses highly 
desirable options for students seeking 
a world-class education.

But a new plan from UC Berkeley 
Chancellor Robert J. Birgeneau could 
severely jeopardize the university’s 
mission to remain open and affordable 
for all qualified applicants regardless of 
family income, a key tenet maintained 
by the university since its inception 
over a century ago. Birgeneau recently 
proposed a plan calling for the Board 
of Regents to shift its longstanding 
policy of keeping tuition rates identi-
cal at each of the nine undergraduate 
campuses systemwide, instead allow-
ing each campus to develop tuition 
rates it deems fit in an effort to com-
bat dwindling state financial support 
and more aggressively compete with 
private institutions. Currently, each 
campus is grouped under a single 
tuition rate, with undergraduates pay-
ing $6,571 per year.

Reasoning that flagship schools 
such as UC Berkeley, UCLA and 
UCSD could raise fees in spite of 
increased costs by banking on their 
notable reputations to attract students, 
Birgeneau’s plan — titled “Access and 
Excellence” — also suggests reducing 
fees at less popular campuses such 
as UC Merced and UC Riverside to 
attract more applicants.

“We believe that it is time for UC 
to consider a more flexible model,” 
Birgeneau wrote. “To be concrete, 
we would suggest that UC consider a 
methodology in which the regents fix 

the mean fee level for the system, but 
allow individual campuses to devi-
ate from the regents number by plus 
or minus 25 percent. Some campus-
es might choose a lower number to 
enhance their economic competitive-
ness, while others, like Berkeley, might 
choose a higher number.”

What Birgeneau fails to realize 
is that his proposal completely con-
tradicts the university’s promise to 
California to uphold accessibility. His 
plan would essentially privatize the 
university, forcing applicants to base 
their preferences upon ability to pay 
rather than granting all qualified appli-
cants an equal opportunity to apply for 
admission to any UC campus.

Birgeneau claims an increase of 
$2,000 per student in tuition for its 
35,000 students would result in $70 
million in additional revenue for UC 
Berkeley, enhancing financial-aid 
availability and raising faculty salaries 
in an effort to attract better professors. 
However, his idea runs counter to the 
university’s  policy that all campuses be 

considered equally in terms of student 
fees and faculty compensation under 
the rationale that campuses lagging 
academically will eventually join their 
top-tier peers if not subjected to finan-
cial disadvantages.

Theoretically, Birgeneau claims 
that by adopting the new proposal, the 
university ensures that more financial 
aid will become available for low-
income students by reducing debt bur-
dens by thousands of dollars, dictating 
that only high-income students be 
subjected to the full amount of the fee 
increases.

But his plan leaves middle-income 
students, often the most heavily 
weighed down by high tuition rates 
and post-graduation debt, the most 
vulnerable of all, as many who just 
miss the financial-aid threshold will 
be mandated to pay sizeable rates 
just to keep up with campus-specific 
tuition hikes, forcing them to confront 
situations where they are academically 
eligible for admission to all campuses 
yet are forced to settle for lower-tier 

campuses because of their inability to 
pay hefty tuition differences.

The harm Birgeneau’s plan will 
bring to prospective students is unde-
niable, as it blatantly disregards the 
university’s position as a public insti-
tution, offering equal chances for all 
qualified individuals. If the university 
truly strives to maintain fair access, the 
proposal must be scrapped.

United, the University Stands Strong and Accessible

And so ends my short-lived stint as the vaguely unmemorable once-every-other-week colum-
nist. “It’s my last column of the year!” I 
told my friend. “It’s going to be good.” 
Unless it’s not, in which case I apolo-
gize in advance.

It’s not that I want to abandon my 
beloved editorial soapbox. I will abso-
lutely miss penning these columns at 
4 a.m. from my dimly lit pigsty that 
occasionally resembles a bedroom. I 
absolutely love receiving your sarcastic 
Facebook messages cleverly disguised 
as compliments. I absolutely appreciate 
that you read my stuff before lining 

your birdcage so that your Polly can 
practice her aim with my caricature. 
Really. 

You see, in approximately a month, 
I will be shoving as many of my belong-
ings as possible into two large suitcases 
to in preparation for taking my stud-
ies elsewhere. Every time I tell some-
one this, the following conversation 
ensues: 

“Where are you studying abroad?”
“Cyprus.”
“What? Why Cyprus?”
Typically, I tell people that 

“Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants” was 
my Mediterranean inspiration. (How 
could you not want to be Alexis Bledel, 
riding her bicycle around open-air 
markets in billowy dresses?) And so 
while I yearned for Greece, Cyprus was 
a slightly more affordable alternative. 

While a tween chick flick may have 
played a tiny part, the real truth is this: 
I can’t say that the curriculum at the 
tiny University of Nicosia is going to be 
educationally life changing. Technology 
and new media don’t exactly make 
waves in Cyprus. From January to May, 
I will have absolutely zero income. I 
will put resume-building on hold as my 
life as a perpetual intern goes on the 
back burner. I certainly won’t be mak-
ing industry contacts for the future, 
and I’m fairly confident that my classes 
will not be teaching me anything cut-
ting-edge. I have little knowledge of the

EDITORIALS

Dear Editor, 
On Nov. 26 there were ghastly 

acts of terror committed in Mumbai, 
India’s financial capital. The ordeal 
lasted 60 hours and killed at least 
183 people, causing an immeasurable 
amount of damage to life and prop-
erty, not to mention the tremendous 
emotional toll it took on the city, 
and certainly the nation as a whole. 
By their actions, it is clear that these 
terrorists have no morals or remorse 
for their crimes. Numerous witness 
reports have come in, recounting 
how the terrorists killed mercilessly 
with smiles across their faces. In 
one instance, one of the terrorists is 
said to have killed a child simply so 
that he would stop crying. While it 
is easy to fly into a rage over what 
has happened (indeed, it would seem 
to be the most expected reaction), 
it is important to remember that 

these attacks cannot be blamed on 
the Islamic religion or the Pakistani 
government. With that said, there 
are some rogue elements within 
the Pakistani government, specifi-
cally the Inter-Service Intelligence 
that funds and promotes these terror 
camps. Fault can be found in the 
fact that the Pakistani government 
was aware of these terror camps yet 
took no substantial actions to shut 
them down. Furthermore, the terror-
ist known as Dawood Ibrahim, who 
is responsible for the 1993 Mumbai 
Stock Exchange bombings, which 
took over 1,000 lives, is reported 
to be residing in Pakistan, but the 
government has refused to investi-
gate these allegations. To promote 
a complete eradication of terrorism 
requires the Pakistani government’s 
full cooperation.

The Indian government is not 
blameless in this matter, though. 
The government’s reaction time was 
severely delayed due to an inefficient 
bureaucracy and infrastructure. It 

took four hours for the comman-
dos to get from Delhi to Mumbai, 
the excuse being that planes were 
unavailable for transport. Mumbai’s 
police force was not equipped to deal 
with an attack of this magnitude, 
with many of the officers lacking 
bulletproof vests. In fact, the owner 
of the Taj Mahal Hotel, Ratan Tata, 
alerted the government that he had 
intelligence indicating that an attack 
of this nature was imminent. Security 
forces were present at the front door, 
however entrances as obvious as the 
back door were left unguarded. This 
illustrates a lack of the basic security 
that any nation as developed as India 
is expected to have. It is clear that a 
major overhaul in national security 
is needed. 

India and Pakistan share many 
cultural origins. They speak many of 
the same languages, eat much of the 
same food and listen to very simi-
lar music. All problems arise when 
poverty, desperation and religious 
extremist are added to the equation. 

This creates a group of people willing 
to kill and die in the blink of an eye, 
all in the name of some perverted 
version of an otherwise beautiful and 
peaceful religion. These acts are con-
demned by both nations, and it’s 
time the governments set aside their 
petty differences and work together 
to create a tangible solution to this 
mounting problem.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR
Nations Must Cooperate  

to Prevent Attacks

See LINES, page 5

Imagine walking into your cal-culus final, opening your exam and seeing, in addition to cryptic 
numeric glyphs, an advertisement for 
your local dentist’s office or even for 
special pizza-delivery rates.

For some students enrolled at local 
Rancho Bernardo High School, these 
strangely located advertisements have 
become a commonplace sidenote to 
their studies. Tom Farber, a teacher at 

the high school faced with ever-dwin-
dling financial support, saw his print-
ing allotment shrink significantly this 
year, and resorted to selling advertise-
ments — mostly from parents’ com-
panies — in order to make up for the 
couple hundred dollars in photocopy-
ing fees that the school couldn’t supply 
under its constrained budget.

One must admit, it’s a simple and 
clever way to make the few extra 

bucks, seeing as no matter how 
injured the eceonomy, there’s always 
a place for advertising. But as institu-
tions of all educational levels across 
the state fall into similar budget cri-
ses, it would be nothing short of an 
embarrassment to see this become a 
trend; compromising the quality of 
course material in order to satisfy 
advertising quotas for something as 
basic as printing costs cannot become 

the norm. Instead, perhaps the school 
could accept these ads (and much-
needed compensation) to be dis-
played in locations other than direct-
ly alongside coursework — such as 
gymnasiums — and apply the money 
generated right back into necessary 
operations such as photocopying.

If Farber meant the unlikely tac-
tic as a cry for help, it certainly has 
served its purpose.

life, unadulterated — not the one of 
Teresa the communication major or 
Teresa the budding marketing profes-
sional or Teresa the freelance writer. 
It doesn’t have to fall into any of 
those categories. Going to Cyprus can 
mean immersing myself in an entirely 
different culture: the people, the food, 
the sights, the sounds. Learning from 
peers who aren’t all victims of the 
same UC factory. Experiencing an 
entirely new kind of independence. 
Trust me, it took a lot of self-justifi-
cation at first, but I finally realized: 
If I should be fortunate enough to 
have this opportunity, I would be 
doing myself a disservice not to take 

it — and so I’m taking it. (The fact 
that Cyprus is home to halloumi, the 
only grillable cheese in existence, is 

just icing on the “Sisterhood”-themed 
cake.)

If you’re thinking about studying 

abroad, please go — and go where you 
want to. While I imagine any interna-
tional experience would be extraordi-
nary, why not end up in the exact place 
you want to be? Not every decision in 
your life has to be 100 percent rational 
or relevant to your future life plans. 
Sometimes you should do something 
because it just makes sense to you.

That’s why I’m spending an entire 
semester on a little island in the 
Mediterranean. ’Cause frankly, people 
who eat a lot of cheese — and grill it, 
too — make plenty of sense to me.

And with that, my school year at 
UCSD comes to an end. Oh, and also? 
My beach will be prettier than yours. 

I’ll send postcards.

For all you paperboys out there still maneuvering the red Radio Flyer wagon with a straight face, welcome to the 21st century. We in the industry use bike baskets now. This Christmas, keep your 
career in mind and wish upon your associates for this practical addi-
tion to your steed, allowing you to deliver today’s headlines to the 137 
bifocaled, balding, crossword-puzzling uncles in the country who still 
subscribe to newspapers — all behind a shiny new receptacle for quills, 
neighborhood maps, business cards and other necessary parapherna-
lia. Stay alert and keep your basket nice and organized, and you may 
even make it as a real live journalist some day.

E squire advises in its every last margin five more ways to avoid looking like an asshole — but chances are, if you’re still sitting there perusing 
$500 single-breasted pinstripe and sifting through over-studied, puffed-up 
variations on calling Halle Berry a sexy bitch, it’s too late. As a longtime 
groupie, I admit we squires think the universe of ourselves and our cutting-
edge tastes. Still, as a connoisseur of brilliant, hip-to-the-times nonfiction, 
I have yet to find a source that beats this rag. Now consider for a second all 
the bull shit you buy for $8 — parking, shitty alcohol, a couple lattes — and 
tell me a full year of chest-pounding genius isn’t worth the same.

T he Flip video camcorder is this season’s all-around best. Hell, even Oprah’s a fan. As the high and mighty, fourth-in-the-staff-box managing editor, I wish I’d made videos of all the late nights and 
dirty brawls that go down in the office. (What, you thought we coexisted 
peacefully on the second floor with the Koala?) Trust me, if the Guardian 
had a YouTube channel ... well, let’s just say LonelyGirl would be mad jeal-
ous of our pageviews. Why send cheesy holiday cards to your grandma 
when you can send a homemade music video? The Flip cam fits right 
in your hand, your pocket, even your stocking — now in high definition.

T hough “Sin City 2” has yet to make its anticipated arrival, Frank Miller tries to reignite his directorial career by flying solo  with “The Spirit” — another comic-book translation reveling in film noir and 
preying on preteen hormones. Moving from his own graphic novels to Will 
Eisner’s famous 1940 series, Miller’s managed to update his high contrast by 
injecting color to streamlined cinematography. The bizarre aesthetics go way 
beyond anything Miller’s ever penned, but just in case you still need convinc-
ing, “The Spirit” boasts a buxom lineup of lusty femme fatales — including 
Scarlet Johansson and Eva Mendes — to lend live-action sex appeal. Add 
Samuel L. Jackson, in his latest B.A.M.F. incarnation as the kimono-clad drag 
king Octopus (as well as the title character’s mysterious masked identity) and 
there’s no doubt of a packed opening night — with a line overflowing the men’s 
restroom for once. In theaters Dec. 25.

F or the sports fan in your life wallowing in nightmares of the Chargers’ sorry attempt at a season, bring them back to a better time — NBA’s golden era — with Basketball’s Best Kept Secret. The long 
forgotten and never popular hip-hop comp features 16 tracks by NBA stars 
and journeymen from 1994, including “Livin’ Large and Legal” by former 
Sonic Gary Payton and “What the Kidd Didd” from superstar Jason Kidd. 
It’s guaranteed to wax true sports lovers nostalgic while shitting their pants 
laughing at the ridiculously awful flows of some of their most beloved ath-
letes. If you’re celebrating Hanukkah, memorize the verses to eight of the 
songs and spit one a night for your loved one. Amazon.com has 71 used 
copies starting from one cent, but if the person you’re buying a gift for 
means a lot to you, splurge and get the album on vinyl for $7.99.

A ccording to the prophecy of Keanu Reeves, a massive bubble of an energy field commanded by a robot named Gort will destroy Earth like a really intense disaster movie if the military doesn’t shoot it down with homing missiles and giant tanks. Based on the 1951 sci-fi gem, Scott 
Derrickson’s 2008 remake throws hollow computer graphics at what was once tasteful to prove that no 
cheesy vision of the near-future is sacred. Reeves plays an alien named Klaatu with human disguise and 
dialogue that rivals the epic “Whoa” he uttered in “The Matrix,” and the CG-rendered robot Gort makes 
Robocop look like a girly man; think “The Day After Tomorrow” meets “Independence Day,” minus the 
big-Willie style. Moral of the story: Don’t drive gas-guzzlers or throw recyclables in the trashcan or a 
fucking huge robot will probably come and end the human race, OK?  In theaters Dec. 12.

A ny photographer will tell you that investing in a lens is far more important than investing in some flashy body — but good glass is expensive. The average student budget doesn’t make room for even 
the most basic camera equipment, which can cost upward of $500 — but 
there is hope. The Nikon or Canon 50mm f/1.8, an insanely fast lens for any 
DSLR/SLR camera, goes for only $80-$110, and is still capable of shooting 
in the worst lighting conditions imaginable without raising the ISO to 
unmanageable levels. No photographer should ever be caught without 
one. This glass will make any amateur on your list look like a pro.

H aving long made a name for himself in urban vistas, David Fincher’s latest endeavor dashes the noc-turnal cityscape in favor of epic rural appeal. Borrowing “Babel” duo Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett for its leading couple, the Orlando-esque voyage (minus the whole transgender thing) blends fact 
with fiction to showcase the curiously long-lasting life of Mr. Button and his romantic adventures throughout 
the world’s most idyllic regions. Though replete with a milieu of historical icons and symbolism and a tad 
more sentimentality than we might expect from a cynic like Fincher, the fresh approach should certainly keep 
a formalistic edge on anything else in the box office. With many already hailing it his best work to date, “The 
Curious Case of Benjamin Button” takes a look back at a man percolated in fantasy only modern cinema could 
animate. In theaters Dec. 25.

SOUR NUNS, NAZI SCIENTOLOGISTS AND SEVEN POUNDS
OF NICE WAIT IN HOLLYWOOD’S WINTER PRESERVES   

M ade-over and puffed up with Metal Gear Solid swag-ger, Tom Cruise regains command as Col. Claus von Stauffenberg, the botched Brutus of Adolf Hitler’s assas-
sination attempt. Bearing an uncanny resemblance to the real-life aris-
tocrat, Cruise and his Nazi co-conspirators wax somber as an ensemble 
cast of PMSing glares. Germany, of course, gets its own sullen makeover 
to match the era, swathed in as much gray, brown and scarlet as a Lane Bryant fall catalogue. It’s been speculated 
from every angle since false release dates first circulated this summer, but “Valkyrie” hopes to redeem Cruise from 
the tabloid toy he’s become, just in time for the holidays. The star’s career isn’t the only thing on the line — MGM 
has poured sufficient sums into the project and hopes to paint the studio’s crimson checkbook black before the 
ever-important Oscar nominations. If the film’s inevitable conclusion is any omen of things to come, it doesn’t 
bode well for the once-bankable icon; MGM, on the other hand, might come out satisfied at the mere feat of 
emerging from the red before the new year rings in. In theaters Dec. 25.

VALKYRIE

T hree years after facetiously chiding Holocaust films for their Oscar-guar-anteeing schmaltz on the British TV show “Extras,” Kate Winslet throws in her bid as the star of high-budget WWII-era drama “The Reader.” 
Based on German author Bernhard Schlink’s 1995 novel, the film traces a late-
1950s affair between former concentration camp guard Hanna Schmitz (Winslet) 
and teenager Michael Berg (David Kross), lulled with classic passages from “The 
Odyssey” and “Huck Finn” for an old-fashioned gal’s titillating pleasure. Eight years 
later, law student Berg witnesses her courtroom defense, the tight-knit secrets of 

her bloodstained past unraveling and rekindling long-buried sentiments. Directed 
by Stephen Daldry, the film steers clear of time-worn Holocaust-narrative standards, 

probing the theme of pardon instead of guilt and opting for the heated throes of passion 
rather than those of corporal incineration — classic Winslet. In theaters Jan. 9.

I n hopes of coat-tailing the political frenzy of the November elections, Ron Howard’s latest draws inspiration from a landmark interview between British talk-show host David Frost and then-resigned president 
Richard Nixon. Adapted from a critically acclaimed British play and featuring 
its original actors, the film harkens weighty, politically charged cinema like 
“Good Night and Good Luck”.  The same interview that resulted in Nixon all 
but pleading guilty to the Watergate crimes, “Frost/Nixon” promises nearly as 
much shock value the second time around — now, back in the States and on the 
big screen to boot. Anyone craving the intellectual exhilaration of watching a 
thrilling debate of wits and dusty electoral commentaries will no doubt get off 
on “Frost,” but if the prospect of a simple man-to-man conversation serving as 
a film’s climax scares the crap out of you, then stay at home and watch TV the 
way it was meant to be watched — on the couch, with your $10 safely stashed 
for another rainy day. In theaters Dec. 5.

FROST/NIXON

YES MAN

Y es Man” is a Jim Carrey movie. We all know what that means: one mediocre man can’t seem to rise from the tedium of day-to-day life. Carl 
Allen’s epiphany is made at a self-help seminar that deliv-

ers his answer in one simple word:  Yes. What 
the Debbie Downer once would have 

refused, he now enthusiastically pur-
sues bungee jumping, responding to 
spam, drinking Red Bull for the first 
time, learning Korean and capering 
on like a college boy who has noth-
ing better to do but snort hot sauce 
up his nose. Never complete with-
out a way-too-good leading lady, 
Carey’s latest dud finds twu wuv in 
the form of Zooey Deschanel, oh so 

attracted to his newfound, happy-go-
lucky charm. Needless to say, there is 

likely an adorable dog, a scooter and two 
wisecracking friends in the mix.

Somewhere along the way, Carl has too much of 
a good thing, goes through Yes crisis, and must learn 
his limitations. Once he returns to a slightly more 
average-man lifestyle, Carl gets the girl, and all are 
returned to their sunny, bouncing smiles once more. 
Cliche, sure — but with a tired-and true funfest, it’s 
hard to say no. In theaters Dec. 19.

DOUBT

S crew designer labels. This time around, the devil wears black habits: Meryl Streep resurrects her trademark constipated face in “Doubt,” adapted 
from the Pulitzer- and Tony-award winning play by 
John Patrick Shanley centering on a case of child moles-
tation at a 1964 Bronx parochial school. Rather than 
gravitating toward scandal, however, the film uses 
black-collar pedophilia to expose the human capac-
ity for glibly relegating doubt into conviction. 

As the school’s no-nonsense principal, Sister 
Aloysius (Streep) lives by strict discipline and 
moral rectitude — proofed, certainly, by the 
yardstick up her ass (if not hidden up her tunic). 
On the flip side, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour 
Hoffman) secularizes his sermons in an effort to 
make the clergy more accessible to the parish. But 
when Sister Aloysius’s vulnerable protege, Sister 
James (Amy Adams), suspects Flynn of devoting 
excessive attention to Donald Muller (Joseph Foster), 
Aloysius crusades to oust Father Flynn from the 
school — only to be met by his aggressive authority. 

Halloweeny costume design belies the powerful 
showcase of acting that “Doubt” promises. Perhaps 
the most baffling creative decision, though, is the 
film’s grand-scale transposition of a minimalist, four-
actor play— undoubtedly one of this winter’s braver 
endeavors. In theaters Dec. 12.

S even names, seven strangers, one secret — the tagline of “Seven Pounds” is vague and corny at best. But don’t be fooled: With a spare, breathless piano soundtrack, an Oscar-worthy, glass-blown script and Rosario 
Dawson’s most fragile performance yet, Will Smith’s latest appeal to the 
Academy promises to be just as heartbreaking as 2006 Christmas tearjerker 
“The Pursuit of Happyness.” 

Smith plays Ben Thomas, a secretive IRS agent with a hard-line, dark-angel atti-
tude toward doing good deeds. He’s searching for seven people upon which to bestow 
his “gifts” (any more hints and it’ll be spoilery), but must test them first to ascertain 
their niceness. Dawson plays Emily, a benefactor of Ben’s brand of tough love who 
eventually falls for him, igniting a time-bound romance — Emily’s weak health could 
fail at any moment — whose ground-shaking conclusion should deliver a twang to 
the heart. “Do you consider yourself a good person?” Ben asks Emily in the film’s 
trailer. Better check twice. In theaters Dec. 19.

SEVEN POUNDS

THE PUNISHER: WAR ZONE

O ne-upping their recent heap of reimagined character films, “Punisher: War Zone” is Marvel’s brand new take on comic-book antihero Frank Castle — better known as the Punisher.  The film follows Castle on his 
one-man crusade against organized crime, introducing us to notorious villain Jigsaw, 
less intent than Marvel’s previous endeavors on applying realistic standards to the 
character’s universe and more willing to create a faithful adaptation of comic lore. 
Wherein the film’s predecessor was essentially a character piece focusing on Castle’s 
tormented psyche, this interpretation aims to center solely on the Punisher’s most dis-
tinguishing quality: his ruthless and brutal vigilantism. With a fiercer Ray Stevenson 
taking new lead, “War Zone” looks to both flaunt the character’s well-known sadism 
and mimic the comic narrator’s notorious maturity. In any case, the franchise’s latest 
outing will be a deliciously gory holiday joyride. In theaters Dec. 25.

BEDTIME STORIES

W hat if you told your favorite bedtime story and it came true? What if you could then make up any story, and it happened in real life? What if Adam Sandler took advantage of this fact and tried to get laid and 
make a lot of money off your gift? What if a midget kicked him in the shins as a result? 
What if Adam Sandler then tried to live out his fantasy to be a cowboy, a gladiator, a 
wizard and a spaceman in the span of 90 minutes? What if Disney gave the OK and 
spent gobs of dough to turn Adam Sandler’s dream into a reality? What if I told you 
this is an actual movie coming out on Christmas Day called “Bedtime Stories”? Would 
you go see it? Of course you would. In theaters Dec. 25.

‘Millionaire’ Director Rolls Eastern 
Romance at the Pace of Mind   

By Leila Haghighat
Staff Writer

A vibrant projection of Western fable onto Eastern landscape, “Slumdog Millionaire” paws at 
the groundwork of a rags-to-rajah 
melodrama with the dogged intent to 
uproot Hollywood’s narrative conven-
tions. Starry-eyed orphan Jamal Malik 
(Dev Patel) ventures onto India’s wild-
ly popular rendition of “Who Wants to 
Be a Millionaire?” and, one question 
away from total domination and 20 
million rupees, harnesses the show’s 
publicity to reconnect with his lost 
childhood love.

The opening scene — 18-year-old 
Jamal stepping onto the show’s set 
with interpolated images of his torture 
— guts the happy-go-lucky aesthetic 
of the game show’s premise. Asking 
“what the hell [can] a slumdog pos-
sibly know,” the police (led by Irrfan 
Khan of “The Namesake”) accuse 
Jamal of fraud. A vulnerability belies 
his resolution as Jamal defends his 
innocence and explains, by regressing 
to abject childhood, exactly how he 
knows the answers.

Thrusting the frame into the pres-
ent and snapping it back to the past, 
the film’s abandonment of linear time 

elicits thrilling whiplash — a kind of 
enigma that reflects director Danny 
Boyle’s own character. 

“The story’s obviously built on 
memories, and you’d normally call 
them flashbacks, but they’re not writ-
ten like flashbacks,” he said. “It just 
goes back and forwards freely. You just 
accept it as all being now, and that’s 
how memories are like — how they roll 
through your brain.” 

Joie de vivre arises from hellish 
ghettos (so goes the film’s mantra), but 
at a heavy cost. Within the labyrinth 
of corrugated tin rooftops and the 
stupor of intoxicating smog devel-
ops Jamal’s rift with his corrupt older 
brother, Salim (Madhur Mittal). What 
ensues is the emergence of an Eastern 
Cain-and-Abel story, and Boyle read-
ily admits “a lot of the Bollywood sto-
rytelling is based on absolute classic 
storytelling techniques.” 

Captivated by Jamal is his burgeon-
ing infatuation with orphan-turned-
concubine Latika (Freida Pinto). 
Jamal has always been adamant (as a 
7-year-old, he caked himself in poo 
for an autograph) and his passion 
for Latika compels him to brave the 
capitalist snares of modern Mumbai

A ll I want for Christmas is love. Warm, acid-reflux-inducing love. Mouth-watering, gut-wrenching, head-jerking whiskey love. On the liquor-store run for nerve-calming holiday cigarettes and 
booze, make sure to grab a bottle for the gift-less — say, a $15 plastic

BLACK VELVET

G ive the gift of Justice this holiday sea-son with French-festive live album and tour documentary A Cross the Universe. 
Following wisely, yet again, in the footsteps of 
robo-house duo Daft Punk, the record turns the 
audience way up in the mix and dissects the pre-
cise sequence of 2007’s Cross, stretching songs into 
space jams and mashing them into each other like 
the good little DJs they are. The hour-long tour 
mockumentary chronicles the Parisians’ wild U.S. 
tour, taking the sex, drugs and violence to tongue-

in-cheek levels. It’s a solid two-disc set of arena electro that any broke col-
lege student can (barely) afford to gift to a brother, sister or dad in midlife 
crisis — then casually slip front-pocket suitcase come Winter Quarter.

Puppy Love 
Belies Tale of 
Tragedy and 

Coming of Age
on the televised show so that she may 
see him.

In their deft transposition of Vikas 
Swarup’s novel “Q & A,” Boyle and 
screenwriter Simon Beaufoy whisk 
together a blend of juxtaposed themes, 
seasoned with humor — commer-
cial wealth, darkened by poverty and 
tainted by sexual abuse. In maintain-
ing the Eastern motif, they appeal to 
a yin-yang philosophy. 

At once panning across the game 
show’s dark, minimalist set, the kinet-
ics of documentary-style camerawork 
then accelerate to capture teeming 
Mumbai alleyways. Boyle effectively 
becomes our tour guide as we scope, 
for the price of a theater ticket, the 
visually stunning and sonically mes-
merizing Indian landscape — tacky 
tourist sites and all. 

A.R. Rahman’s electronic 
soundtrack blends Euro-house with 
traditional Indian strings, similarly 
multi-linking the foreign kaleido-
scope of colored garb and panorama 
of skyscrapers. 

“India’s a very romantic place,” 
said Boyle of his filming environment 
and its people. “Ironically, given the 
poverty, it’s a very passionate place. 
You can say that technically [people 
in India’s slums] are poor, but they 
don’t feel poor. They’re aspirational. 
They’re very community-organized. 
They look after each other.”

In filming on location over three 
months with only $13 million, Boyle 
relinquishes the usual epicenter of his 
craft: control. 

“The sense of movement [in 
India’s population] creates and the 
change, the constant change, is enor-
mous,” he said. “You have to respond 
to reality, rather than going with a 
rigid idea for a film.”

And respond he did. Discovering 
that native child actors lacked English-
speaking skills induced rewriting the 
first third of the film’s script and 
shooting it in Hindi with the addition 
of subtitles. 

Two-thirds into the film, however, 
“Slumdog” finds itself entangled in 
the puppy pound of cliche love, as 
deus ex machina belittles Jamal and 
Latika’s otherwise volatile relation-
ship to that of familiar star-crossed 
lovers. Perhaps the abandonment of 
its brilliant child actors, free of inhi-
bition, furthers the film’s plight. In 
older age, Latika supposedly adopts a 
rigid exoskeleton, hardened by child-
hood adversities, but Pinto proves 
little more than a pretty face and 
damsel in distress.

Meanwhile, Jamal is an atypical 
hero, physically lanky and reticent 
in his personality. His vulnerability 
renders his character all the more 
palpable and reflects the authenticity 
Boyle chases. 

“The mission was to [make the 
film] as subjectively as possible,” 
Boyle said. “And I figured the only 
way you could really do it was to just 
throw people in there. Make it on the 
streets — as real as possible. Don’t 
try to organize it or control it too 
much because it’ll look like you are 
manipulating it … You’ve always got 
to try to see it from inside the char-
acters rather than bring a lot of your 
Western baggage with it.”

A mixed breed of Dickensian 
plotlines and Bollywood glamour, 
“Slumdog Millionaire” translates 
the addiction of America’s beloved 
game show into the tension of an 
Easterner’s coming of age. How so? It 
walks tactfully on a tightrope above 
age-old storytelling, wobbling only 
in the end. Pulled on one side by 
escapist tendencies and on other with 
unsympathetic realism, it strides 
gracefully from one genre to the next. 
Final answer.

HOT CORNER

THURSDAY, DECEMBER 4, 2008

By Robert Ingle
Staff Writer

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — Senior 
forward Michelle Osier continued her 
strong play at the Mt. McKinley Bank 
North Star Invitational in Fairbanks, 
Alaska, leading the Tritons to three 
straight victories.

UCSD opened the three-day tour-
nament with a 65-59 victory over No. 
17 Holy Family on Thanksgiving, and 
then downed Hawaii-Pacific 73-60 
and tournament host University of 
Alaska 66-56.

“It’s still early and we certainly 
have things to work on, but I was 
really pleased with our efforts on the 
defensive end,” head coach Charity 
Elliot said.

Against the University of Alaska 
Nanooks, Osier did her part for the 
Tritons by scoring 18 points and grab-
bing 11 rebounds — her second dou-
ble-double of the year — on 7-of-13 
shooting from the field. 

The Tritons got off to a quick start, 
jumping out to a 14-7 advantage with 
12:49 left in the first half. Free throws 
by junior forward Erin Noonan raised 
the lead to eight points late in the 
period, and the Tritons took a 31-25 
advantage into the break. 

Coming back from intermission, 
the Nanooks closed the gap to three 
before UCSD exploded with an 8-0 
run capped off by a layup from junior 
guard Annette Ilg. The Tritons main-
tained their strong surge and extended 
the lead to 45-32 at the 11:23 mark. 
A weak push from the University of 
Alaska was stopped short by senior 
center Alexis Gaskin hitting two free 
throws, and an Osier jumper sealed 
the game.

Gaskin notched 13 points and 10 
boards while Noonan scored 10 of 
her 12 points on the night from the 
foul line. 

Playing for the first time against 
the Hawaii-Pacific Sea Warriors, the 
Tritons turned up their offense, scor-
ing a season-high 73 points. UCSD 
had three players in double dig-
its while Noonan and junior guard 

Leilani Martin dished out six assists 
apiece.

Gaskin started off the Triton attack 
by scoring the first four points. Two 
free throws by Martin put the Tritons 
up 25-12 midway through the first 
half, and the Sea Warriors could get no 
closer than 10 points in the period. 

Hawaii-Pacific came out battling 
after the break with a 13-6 run and 
cut the Triton advantage to three. 
A jumper by sophomore forward 
Lindsey Dreher off an Osier assist 
countered the Sea Warrior rally, but 
UCSD went scoreless over the next 
1:20 and Hawaii-Pacific tied the score 
at 48. With the Sea Warriors only 
down by one point at the six-minute 
mark, an Ilg three-point basket start-
ed a 10-0 UCSD surge which ended 
Hawaii-Pacific’s hopes.

Ilg finished the game with 15 
points, five rebounds and three steals 
for the Tritons while Osier put forth 
a dominating 20-point, eight-rebound 
effort. 

The No. 17 Holy Family Tigers 
were on the receiving end of a Triton 
smothering, with UCSD shooting 62 
percent from the field in the first 
half and leading by as many as 23 
points before the half. Six Triton play-
ers scored to start the game as UCSD 
took off from the opening tip to a 21-4 
lead and didn’t slow down until the 
intermission leading 41-22.

Following the break, Holy Family 
looked like a totally different team, 
coming out with a 12-3 run to pull to 
within 10 points at the 14:33 mark. A 
second rally by Holy Family late in the 
second period brought the score to 53-
52 with six minutes left in the game, 
but Ilg answered with a layup that 
sparked a 6-0 Triton run and swung the 
momentum back to UCSD. From that 
point on, the Tritons clamped down to 
finish the game. Despite the first-half 
dominance of her squad, Elliott knew 
the Tigers were not done fighting.

“Holy Family is a very good team 
so I wasn’t surprised with their come-
back,” she said. “We had a few let 
downs on defense and they made us 
pay — but I was proud of how we 

maintained our composure and fin-
ished out the win.”

Osier and Gaskin combined for 30 
points and 16 rebounds while Noonan 
had eight points and eight boards.

While happy with the victories, Ilg 
said that the Tritons weren’t clicking 
on all cylinders — something they’ll 
need to fix as they enter the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association play. 

“We would play well in stretches 
but not the whole time,” she said. 

“Humboldt State and Sonoma State 
caused us some problems last year so 
we will need to start playing for 40 
minutes.”

The Tritons begin conference play 
at home against Humboldt State on 
Dec. 5 at 5:30 p.m. before taking on 
Sonoma the next day also at 5:30 p.m. 
in RIMAC Arena.

CLUB SPORTS — The men’s hockey 
team has had its share of ups and 
downs this season. After coming out 
of the gate strong and winning three 
out of its first four games, the Tritons 
suffered a five-game losing streak 
which they hope to snap before 
focusing their sights on the playoffs.

After many weekends of travel-
ing, UCSD finally played its home 
opener against UC Irvine at UTC 
Ice Town on Nov. 21. Junior forward 
Casey Gong’s impressive five-goal, 
six-point display was not enough 
for UCSD, and the team fell to the 
Anteaters 10-9. The match was 
UCSD’s last of the quarter, with play 
resuming on Jan. 10 against Cal State 
Northridge at home. Moving for-
ward, the team hopes to step up its 
game and squeeze into the playoffs.

“I think we haven’t played to 
our potential,” senior forward Ken 
Yamashita said. “We had higher 
hopes coming into the season, and 
with a couple of early wins we defi-
nitely felt strong. Lately we have slid 
off and we definitely should have 
done better.”

Injuries have been a major con-
cern for the Tritons, evidenced by 
their two-game set at Northern 
Arizona University on Nov. 14 and 
15. UCSD traveled to the desert with 
less than two full lines. Meanwhile, 
the Ice Jacks were equipped with four 
full lines for the series. As a result, 

the Tritons were pummeled 10-1 and 
13-3 in the contests.

Still, there have been a few bright 
spots for the Tritons this season that 
give them hope for better results 
come January.

“One player that has really 
stepped up for us lately is our goalie, 
Ben Cohen,” Yamashita said. “He has 
kept us in games and has at times 
been the lone reason we have stayed 
in games.”

For the Tritons to advance to 
the postseason, UCSD must crack 
the top 10 in its division during the 
regular season and, currently sitting 
in 11th place, the playoffs are well 
within reach. After loads of travel 
and playing without a full squad, 
UCSD will use the upcoming break 
to recuperate and re-energize for the 
second half of the season.

“In order to make the playoffs, 
we must mainly play smart and with 
endurance,” Yamashita said. “We 
have lost a couple of players so far, so 
endurance is key for us. We’ve played 
tired, which is where things have 
gone bad for us. This season has not 
gone as planned because we have not 
been playing smart and conserving 
enough energy.”

As the team gets healthy and 
rested to resume play next month, 
the Tritons can only hope that the 
tough battles start paying off in the 
box score.

UCSD Brings Out the Brooms in AlaskaA SPORTS 
FAN’S 

HOLIDAY 
WISH LIST
As the holiday season approach-es, the focus for many will shift to family, friends, giving and 
receiving. So in the spirit of selfishness, 
it seems fitting to present an agenda-
filled sports wish list:

1. Get rid of Norv Turner. He has 
proven time and again that while he is a 
capable offensive coordinator, he is not 
a good head coach. The only reason 
he got the job was because Chargers 
general manager A.J. Smith fired Marty 
Schottenheimer deep into the 2007 off-
season, and then Turner just Callahan-
ed the team into the playoffs. The dif-
ference is Bill Callahan was able to get 
the Jon Gruden-built Oakland Raiders 
to the Super Bowl before everyone real-
ized he was a crappy coach who lucked 
out with a team others had built. A 
series of close losses this season just 
shows that the more time the Chargers 
spend with Turner, the more they bask 
in that permeating losing stench.

2. More Lakers greatness, but less 
Lakers exaggerations. While the Lakers 
have looked awesome up to this point 
in the season, they are not a perfect 
team, are not a lock to win the NBA 
Championship and are not the equiva-
lent of the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls squad 
that went an all-time best 72-10. With 
Andrew Bynum back in the lineup and 
Lamar Odom accepting his role coming 
off the bench, L.A. is off to a 14-2 start. 
However, 70 wins is a lot harder than it 
may seem right now.

3. Change the Rose Parade into a 
Derrick Rose Parade. Rose has been 
amazing for a Chicago Bulls squad that 
hasn’t done much to help him. New 
Year’s Day could include highlights 
from his NBA career thus far, or maybe 
just let him wave from the floats for 
awhile. Rose might not be as flashy as 
Chris Paul, but every time you watch 
him play, it seems like the start of some-
thing special.

4. Prevent the Angels from signing 
C.C. Sabathia. While a trade for Jake 
Peavy would help the team, Sabathia 
is a mistake waiting to be made. 
Hopefully, the Yankees will be making 
it and receiving the gift of weight issues 
and postseason collapses. The Angels 
had an overweight ace in Bartolo Colon 
before. I think he offered me bacon and 
avocado at Subway the other day.

5. Send the Dodgers back to 
Brooklyn and let their bandwagon fans 
follow. New L.A. fans hope Manny is 
re-signed so they can keep wearing the 
fake dreads they bought. Other baseball 
fans think the team belongs back East 
with New York and Boston. While the 
Dodgers are worthwhile to relive past 
greats, many of the fans for the Dodgers 
this year don’t even remember when 
Eric Gagne was good.

6. Give Plaxico Burress a holster 
and a little common sense. Following 
Burress’ inability to show up for prac-
tice, the Giants receiver went out for a 
night on the town. If you’re heading to a 
nightclub, you might want to leave your 
gun at home. If your gun falls out of 
your pocket and shoots you in the leg, 
you’re probably better off not saying it 
happened at Applebee’s and your name 
is Harris Smith. This is worse than 
when Michael Vick tried to sneak weed 
through an airport with a water bottle. 
Also, Ron Mexico is a way better alias 
than Harris Smith.
