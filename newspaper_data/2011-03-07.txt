Residential life is offering 807 transfer students the opportunity to live in the 
new Village II on-campus apartments for Fall Quarter 2011. 

The Village II — also known as The Village at Torrey Pines East — 
apartments use sustainable energy to power the building. Sustainable energy 
sources include wind-fueled cooling system, balcony shading and large windows 
for natural lighting, a solar water-heating system and a drip-irrigation system for 
native outdoor plants using recycled water. 

The new apartments are located north of Eleanor Roosevelt College and 
adjacent to Village I apartments — which were completed in May 2009 and 
officially opened in January 2010 after two years of construction that costs $12 
billion — in the north entrance of campus. 

The apartments contain five residential buildings and two mixed-use buildings

Students can look forward to higher-profile 
entertainers on campus as a result of RIMAC Arena’s 
new partnership with Nederlander Concerts, a West 
Coast entertainment production company.

The five-year contract, announced Feb. 23, 
stipulates that the company will bring a minimum 
of six large arena shows to RIMAC per academic 
year. Nederlander will also have rights to RIMAC 
Field, which has a max capacity of 20,000.

A closer look

Plans for the renovation of the University House — the official residence of UCSD chancellors 
since 1967 — are in full swing after the 
university received a $2-million donation 
from Audrey Geisel in December. 

The house — located at 9360 La Jolla 
Farms Rd., across the street from Revelle 
College — was closed in 2004 due to 
structural damage and the discovery 
of Native American artifacts under its 
foundation. 

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox, who has 
held her position since April 2004, has 
never lived in the house and currently 
lives in her own private residence.

UCSD’s physical planning 
department released an environmental 
impact report on Jan. 28. According 
to the report, the 60-year-old house 
does not meet current safety standards 

for natural disasters, and its roof and 
plumbing need replacement. In addition, 
the bluff on the south side of the property 
is eroding due to water runoff, tree roots 
and major winter storms. 

In 2008, the campus created a 
University House advisory group with 
local community members to oversee 
reconstruction of the house and to be 
culturally respectful to the Kumeyaay 
— the Native American tribe whose 
ancestors were buried on the site.

The advisory board decided the 
house should be rehabilitated instead 
of being demolished. Currently, the 
renovation is estimated to cost between 
$8 to $10 million. 

The cost is due to the necessity of 
attaching a roof. The remodel will also 
update the house’s drainage program 
and build a wall along the adjacent bluff 

to halt erosion. Renovators will also have 
to work around the Kumeyaay remains 
on site. 

The university attempted to fix 
the damage and received $5 million 
in donations from San Diego 
philanthropists such as Geisel and Irwin 
Jacobs. 

The university spent $440,000 on an 
architect, but the prospect of repair was 
met with protest and animosity from 
the public and alumni due to the bones 
buried under the house.

In early December 2010, Geisel — 
the widow of Theodor Geisel, or Dr. 
Seuss — donated $2 million for the 
house’s reconstruction project in honor 
of the university’s 50th anniversary 
celebration. This donation revived

Seven years after being shut down due to safety issues, University House — the official residence 
of the UCSD Chancellor — is finally being repaired.

W hether you’re paddling your way around a sea of kelp or cruising down a country road with shoes hanging from telephone poles, 
there’s no place like the San Juan Islands. Located just 
off the coast of Seattle, the islands are tucked away 
from everyday hustle and bustle — no commercial 
planes allowed. 

The best-known of the islands are Friday Harbor 
and Orcas Islands — both of which feature a number 
of quaint bed-and-breakfasts, which can run anywhere 
from $150 to $400 a night. If you don’t feel compelled 
to wake up to a home-cooked breakfast or blow a 
full paycheck on a single night’s stay, check out the 
campgrounds on the islands, like Mitchell’s Landing, 
where a tent site goes for $25 a day.

Friday Harbor is everyone’s favorite outdoor 
wonderland. Kayaking shops around the island boast 
competitive prices and an ever-widening variety of 
classes and tours, though stick to one that only takes a 
few guests out for more attention and a faster-moving 
group. There’s nothing like watching a seal swim just 
below your kayak to make you think, “Holy crap, I’m 
in nature.” 

Other land-bound adventures can be experienced 
on the many trails crisscrossing both islands, making 
this jewel of the Pacific Northwest accessible by bike 
or foot. Other attractions on Friday Harbor include 
Pelindaba Lavender Farms, a popular site with an 
ever-expanding gift shop, and a Krystal Acres alpaca 
farm. 

For a more affordable indulgence than a $200 
alpaca blanket, check out the Crab House, a gazebo 
restaurant overlooking the ferry dock. Not only is all 
the food cheap, the restaurant owners have managed 
to fry every possible form of sea life for their menu.

Researchers track erupted Solar flares causing Northern Lights
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

By Rebecca Horwitz
Staff Writer

Researchers are tracking erupted 
solar flares that sent plasma towards 
the Earth on Feb. 15. 

The UCSD team is using a 
satellite monitor known as Solar 
Mass Ejection Imager to track the 
plasma from the flares — which 
disrupted telecommunications 
on Earth in China and created an 
aurora borealis — considered the 
largest solar flare that has erupted 
since December 2006.

Research physicist Bernard 
Jackson said he was surprised 
to discover aurora borealis, or 
northern lights, while looking at 
data from the SMEI — developed 
by UCSD’s Center for Astrophysics 
and Space Science in 2003. SMEI 
is traveling on the Coriolis satellite 
that’s orbiting around Earth.

“We didn’t count on seeing 
aurora from that high orbit, about 
840 kilometers,” Jackson said. “Most 
aural processes die out at a few 

hundred kilometers.”
Solar flares cause geomagnetic 

storms, auroras and satellite outages 
that can be predicted by the SMEI. 
Jackson said his team can watch the 
events in real time as the solar flare 
moved out.

The most intense solar flare 
occurred on Feb. 14, traveling at 
580 miles per second.

Jackson’s research focuses on 
solar flare events, the disruptions 
they cause and their morphology. 
Jackson is currently observing flares 
for three months in Japan, where 
he is analyzing differences between 
solar flare material when it passes 
through space and when it reaches 
Earth. 

“We are interested in order to 
learn the true extent of the event 
energy and how this is manifest 
and directed throughout the 
heliosphere,” Jackson said.

The instruments Jackson created 
has played a large role in the 
discovery of aurora borealis during 
a solar flare. SMEI was created to 

view solar wind, also known as 
Thomson scattered light. 

“It was a unique instrument; 
no one has ever tried to do this,” 
Jackson said. “No one had tried 
to view the whole sky, the space 
between the stars.”

The SMEI was intended to last 
two years, but has now been in space 
for over seven years, located in a 
lower orbit 842 kilometers above the 
Earth, where the light meets dark.   

“For me, I was very interested 
in building a massive imaging 
ejector to answer the questions I 
couldn’t answer with the technique 
of planetary simulation,” Jackson 
said. “It could get velocities but not 
materials.”

The instrument carefully 
removes the light from the stars, the 
zodiacal light — also known as dust 
— and stray light from the sunlight 
to view the Thomson scattered light. 
SMEI makes 102-minute orbits and 
measures the brightness of the sky 
around the earth.

The solar flare activity has 

increased recently because of a very 
long solar minimum period, about 
40 years. The solar maximum is 
usually once every 11 years, which is 
when solar activity is at it’s highest. 

“In the future I expect quite a 
few events that are bigger,” Jackson 
said of the solar flares. “If SMEI 
continues to be operable, then it will 
be involved in forecasting.”

for concerts and attractive for performing artists,” 
Nederlander CEO Alex Hodges said.  

The partnership went into effect in early February. 
The company’s first event on campus this year was last 
month’s Interpol concert. 

Rise Against is scheduled to perform at RIMAC 
Arena on April 8 and Sugarland will play at RIMAC 
Field on July 23.

According to Hodges, Nederlander will help RIMAC 
Arena become a popular destination for musicians and 
other live entertainment acts.

“If artists aren’t constantly reminded about other 
venues, they will continue to be booked in the same 
places,” Hodges said. 

He also noted that the bolstered venues should 
generate more revenue on campus.

According to Associate Vice Chancellor of Student 
Life Gary Ratcliff, the university generates income from 
large concerts.  

“Expanding the number of concerts at RIMAC 
Arena and Field will enable the numerous departments 
involved in these events to support their budgets through 
additional event revenue,” Ratcliff said in an e-mail.  

According to Ratcliff, Nederlander will be required 
to pay a percentage of the gross tickets sales of each 
show, with a rental amount that increases each year of 
the agreement, though Ratcliff did not disclose specific 
figures.

If Nederlander does not meet the minimum number 
of shows in a year, it is required to pay rent for that 
number of shows and the university has the option to 

end the contract, Ratcliff said.
Ratcliff said the deal will bring critical funds to 

campus.
“UCSD has become a model on the West Coast 

for schools looking to expand student life through 
increasing numbers of events,” Ratcliff said. “This 
partnership with Nederlander Concerts will enable our 
campus to keep raising the bar as a premier presenter of 
the arts and live events.”

Hodges hopes the partnership will succeed and plans 
to continue booking shows at RIMAC after the contract 
is up. 

Nederlander will work with student organizations 
to put on shows, but the partnership will not prevent 
student organizations from using RIMAC’s facilities 
for existing annual campus traditions, like the Sun God 
Festival and Fusion — Multi-Asian Student Association’s 
annual hip-hop dance competition. 

“In the last decade, UCSD has grown to producing 
over 250 concerts a year,” Ratcliff said. “Student surveys 
have repeatedly demonstrated that continuing this trend 
is a priority for our students.” 

The partnership is a result of an open request from 
the sports facilities office to local concert promoters for 
an exclusive partnership in spring 2009, Ratcliff said. 

The office wanted to see if promoters could increase 
the quantity and quality of advertised and ticketed shows 
and increase student participation in concert planning. 
Nederlander responded with a proposal outlining its 
plans to achieve the goals. 

that will contain dining, a market and 
faculty office space. The Village II was 
completed mid-February and will 
house its first residents next fall. 

Spanning 238,000 gross square feet, 
the new apartments are part of the 
North Campus Housing project — 
which includes 146 five- and six-bed 
student dwelling units. 

Building 1 features a maintenance 
shop and interior bicycle parking, 
Buildings 2-5 contains a laundry 
facility and student meeting rooms 
and Buildings 6-7 will provide a dining 

facility, a market and faculty office 
spaces. 

Although the North Campus 
Housing project provides an 
environmentally sustainable lifestyle, 
some students expressed mixed 
feelings.

“I’m kind of shocked they even 
made [the Village II] since they 
couldn’t even fill up the Village I the 
first year it opened,” Marshall College 
senior Steven Vanderberg said.

In each apartment, there is a living-
dining kitchen area, shared bathrooms 
with low-flow fixtures. 

The project qualifies for a 
Leadership in Energy & Environmental 
Design (LEED) Gold application with 
the U.S. Green Building Council. It 
was built in partnership with Clark 
Design/Build of America and using 
recycled and locally-produced building 
materials.

QUICKTAKES  Scholarship for White Males

There comes a time in every student’s career when the impending shock of the great 
unknown sets in — the bleak, bleak 
reality of a world beyond term-paper 
extensions or Sun God Festivals, and 
certainly without something called a 
student account for charging the lat-
est “Economist” or, more realistically, 
“U.S. Weekly.” 

It’s a grim realization indeed that 
even farting around in classes called 
“Intro to Playwriting” can, over time, 
fill a transcript past the watermark, 
that point at which — no matter the 
tenacity of one’s desire for just one 
more pass at “Great Performances on 
Screen: Meryl Streep” — there is no 
feasible return. (Just ballooning stu-
dent loans, a dismal job market and 
an overpriced cap and gown.)

For me, it’s been as simple as hav-
ing to admit lately that I graduate 
next year. Not to myself, in a kind 
of pseudo-empowering, therapist-
sanctioned mantra in front of the 
mirror (talk about white girl prob-
lems), but to others: distant relatives, 
new acquaintances. Most interac-
tions of the kind also require a brief 
recap: still a writing major, still not 
sure what I plan to do with that, 
though I hear there may be an open-
ing for dish washer/pasta boiler in 
my mom’s kitchen. No pay, decent 
benefits. 

Sure, there’s always the distant, 
vague possibility of grad school. 
But as far as I’ve gleaned from TAs 
over the past three years, admission 
requires facial hair, a smug, serious 
demeanor and at least two tweed 
blazers. (All of which I’m incapable 
of or would grow to hate myself for 
— though God only knows that bit-
ter San Diego winters demand tex-
tiles more serious than cotton.) 

Instead I’ve taken the shock at 
face value: a jolt, a call to action, 
maybe even an excuse to drink a 
fourth cup of coffee before the day’s 
end. Though I always thought of 
overextending oneself in college as a 
hopeless, nerve-wracking means to 
some parent-approved end — and 
wasn’t that whole song-and-dance 
supposed to be up with SAT results 
and college acceptance? — it’s started 
to make more sense to me. While 
I’ve got a fair share of friends hold-
ing down cooler titles than pan-
scrubber less than a year after gradu-
ation, they’re mostly also people who 
made it through the day on three 
hours of sleep and as many cans of 
Red Bull.

No campus psychiatrist would 
dare lend credence to my hypothesis 
that the only way to leave college 
both fulfilled and gainfully employ-
able today — you know, with decent 
grades, good friends and Friday 
nights devoid of Geisel’s reflective 
glass — is to take on more than one 
hyper-caffeinated kid from the sub-
urbs was ever supposed to. (Or else 
maybe choose a practical, sciencey 
major, though that ship probab-ly 
sailed with my high-school chemis-
try requirement.)

Might sound drastic, but for now, 
on the cusp of this fifth-to-last finals 
season, the extra push feels neces-
sary. If it can spare me the invest-
ment in tweed or new dishwashing 
gloves, I might even finally warm to 
Red Bull. 

The Race 
to the Prize 
Starts Now

The Safety’s Off

Students and educators across the coun-try are up in arms over the possibility of guns being permitted on college 
grounds. 

Last Wednesday, an Oklahoma state com-
mittee passed a bill (HB 2087) that would 
allow professors and faculty members to carry 
concealed weapons on college campuses. It 
will now advance to the main body for a vote. 
If the measure successfully passes in both the 
Oklahoma House and Senate, citizens will get 
to vote as early as next November on whether 
to officially adopt the policy.

The author of the bill, Rep. Randy Terrill 
(R- OK), argues that guns on campus will allow 
for greater protection in the event of another 
school shooting. Twenty-five college and uni-
versity officials in Oklahoma have publicly 
opposed the bill — and for good reason. That 
line of logic — in addition to being counter-
intuitive and circular — has been consistently 
disproven. According to the New England 
Journal of Medicine, “A gun in your home 
makes it three times more likely that you or 

someone you care about will be murdered.”
Oklahoma is not the first to propose legisla-

tion in this vein: Nine other states, including 
neighboring Arizona, have presented similar 
measures. Texas is proposing to go one step 
further and allow both students and professors 
to carry firearms; Colorado State University 
has already allowed students to carry concealed 
weapons on campus, so long as they have a 
legal permit. 

The authors of the bill have argued that this 
will help professors fulfill their duty of protect-
ing the students. But the professor-student 
relationships in an average college bear little 
in common to elementary- or middle school 
teacher-student relationships. College profes-
sors are expected to challenge and engage 
students, not act as paternalistic figures that 
would protect the 500-plus students with 
whom they have formed little to no connec-
tion. 

In April 2007 at Virginia Tech, a mentally 
unbalanced student gunman killed over 30 
people over the course of a few hours. Gun 

rights proponents jumped on the issue, argu-
ing that if guns had been legally allowed on 
campus, the shooter might have been stopped 
sooner. University officials, however, thought 
otherwise: Following the shooting, Virginia 
Tech prohibited even authorized gun owners 
from bringing firearms on campus. Even if 
a student or professor has a firearm to pro-
tect themselves, another weapon on campus 
imposes a greater threat of misuse. 

And regardless of the motivations behind 
having a weapon on campus, they’re still dan-
gerous. It would only worsen the situation and 
increase the volatility of a gunman should he 
or she obtain access to additional weapons, or 
if the professor is unsure how to fire it prop-
erly.

The omnipresence of alcohol on campuses 
could add dangerous fuel to the flames. A 
full 95 percent of violent crime on college

A scholarship created exclusively to help white males is making waves in higher 
education. The founder of the Former Majority 
Association of Equality, Texas student Colby 
Bohannan, seeks to provide $500 college 
scholarships for men who are at least a quarter 
Caucasian, making it a prime support target for 
white supremacist groups.

Even though Bohannan has said that “we do 
not accept donations from organizations affili-
ated with any sort of white supremacy or hate 
group,” the fund will inevitably attract unwanted 
interest from white supremacist groups. While 
the intentions of the fund — to help young 
white males in need — may be noble, it’s unreal-
istic to assume that the organization will be able 
to screen every donor’s intentions. 

While Bohannan may be able to tear up 
checks made out by the KKK, it will be impos-
sible to screen every individual who chooses to 
donate. It will be impossible to know the moti-
vations behind any donation by John Doe. Any 
individual who sends a check could be moti-
vated by racist or white supremacist values, and 
the FMAE will be none the wiser. If Bohannan 
chooses to continue in his endeavor, he will have 
to live with the fact that his scholarship will 
likely be funded by bigots.

The Former Majority Association of Equality (an organization that provides scholarships for 
non-minority students) has ignited a debate about 
the ethics of a white male-specific scholarship. 

Even though the organization has drawn accu-
sations of fueling white privilege, the fund can’t be 
treated differently than any other. The FMAE is 
a small group of individuals entitled to its inten-
tions, not a government agency committed to fair 
treatment. Whether the members want to help 
the underprivileged or seek to negate all minority-
based scholarships, they retain the right to award its 
money with whatever stipulations they see fit.

Opponents of the fund are quick to rebuke 
without considering the reality of today’s students. 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, white people 
will be a minority by 2050. FMAE founder Colby 
Bohannan centers his operations in San Marcos, 
Texas, where 22 percent of the white majority under 
18 live in poverty and have trouble finding financial 
aid, so there’s nothing wrong with helping this oft-
neglected group. If critics find this approach unfair, 
they should investigate the scholarships that most 
people consider arbitrary. While funding specific 
to nudists and marbles (yes, the sport) enthusi-
asts manages to steer clear of public scrutiny, the 
FMAE’s critics condemn it with the very same race-
based selectivity they claim to reject.

You Can’t Screen for White Supremacy
T exas State University is offering a new schol-arship fund to target a group that tradition-
ally has received little in the monetary aid arena: 
white guys. The requirements are lenient: one 
need only be at least 25-percent Caucasian and 
100-percent male to qualify. 

The fund’s controversy stems from that very 
lack of specificity. Although Caucasian techni-
cally means those that are “indigenous to Europe, 
northern Africa, western Asia, and India,” today it 
is used interchangeably with “white,” making the 
scholarship one that is exclusively about race. 

Of course, this is nothing new: Though Texas 
State offers scholarships devoted to Hispanic 
students and there are a plethora of scholarship 
opportunities for black and Asian students out 
there, these scholarships serve to help even the 
field for students whose background may have 
served as a disadvantage due to centuries of white 
oppression, whereas white students have benefit-
ted from white privilege at every turn. 

There’s plenty of white students who need help 
too, and there’s nothing wrong with helping all 
demographics go to college. But the creators of 
the fund should keep in mind that this is more 
than just any other scholarship, it’s the promotion 
of an all-encompassing white privilege that makes 
this a far trickier issue.

Scholarship Enforces White Privilege

concealed firearm) is certainly within 
the realm of possibility. There’s an 
obvious danger in having drunk 
students with unrestricted access to 
firearms.

While many Californians exer-
cise their legal right to bear arms, 
gun culture is not embedded in the 
state lifestyle. Firearms are forbid-
den on all school grounds, from 
K-12 to colleges and universities. 
In the past year, 10 additional states 
have moved campus gun legislation 
through their systems — not all of 
which are even red states. Utah and 
Colorado are the only states that 

have successfully passed legislation, 
but Texas is on the cusp of joining 
the club. 

A well-equipped and well-trained 
campus police force is a much stron-
ger response than opening the pos-
sibility to a chaotic shootout in the 
cafeteria. The campus police are pro-
fessionally trained and have the skills 
to effectively protect people, while 
students with guns are likely to cause 
more trouble than prevent it. 

After the Virginia Tech shoot-
ing, the federal government passed 
the bill HR 2640 in 2008, which 
would halt gun purchases for those 
declared mentally unstable. By 

monitoring those who have access 
to firearms, it’s a step to getting to 
the root of the problem — which is 
always a better solution than simply 
mediating the symptoms or trying 
to address the situation after there’s 
a problem.

Students already have enough to 
worry about with existing academic 
and social stresses. The added anxi-
ety of worrying about whether our 
classmates are carrying firearms 
may easily be avoided, provided 
state legislators have the sense to see 
that they represent more a danger-
ous threat than a useful defense.

The More Weapons on Campus, the Greater the Danger

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
On March 10, one of Israel’s 

most prominent hip-hop groups, 
called Hadag Nahash, is performing 
at Porter’s Pub by the Old Student 
Center. Although fans describe them 
as a hip-hop group, they incorporate 
a fusion of various musical styles into 
their songs such as funk, jazz, and 
rock. 

Not only have they already 
released six albums, but one of them 
has also achieved platinum status. 
They have won numerous awards 
from Israeli music channels and 
newspapers throughout the last few 
years.

It is also interesting to know that 
their lyrics are written in social and 
political perspectives, which reaches 
beyond the musical realm and into 
the realm of public debate.

 For those who have not heard of 
them before, their music has been 
selected to be featured in American 
media. Hadag Nahash was featured 
in Adam Sandler’s 2008 movie “You 
Don’t Mess With The Zohan” and 
their song “Lo Maspik” (meaning 
“Not Enough”) was featured on the 
soundtrack of “The Sims 3 Expansion 
Pack: Late Night.” More information 

about them can be found on their 
Facebook page and on their official 
website: www.hadagnahash.com.

I believe that UCSD students 
would have great interest attending 
this concert because not only will 
they enjoy freestyle dancing to some 
awesome fusion hip-hop music, but 
they will also experience watching a 
live performance by a foreign band 
whose music reaches out to both 
Israelis and people from across the 
world. It will be a fantastic perfor-
mance and a great event to attend as a 
study break before finals. 

Tickets are free for UCSD stu-
dents and can be received at the Price 
Center Box Office. Non-UCSD stu-
dents must pay $8 and all others must 
pay $20. The doors open at 7 p.m. 
and the show begins at 8 p.m.

reconstruction plans. 
“The $2 million gift from Audrey Geisel will help 

to pay for the renovation to University House,” UCSD 
spokesperson Judy Piercey said. “All costs for the 
renovation will be paid by philanthropic donations and 
other non-state resources.” 

This renovation will be monitored by the advisory 
board. According to advisory group chair Brian Gregory, 
the group includes representatives from the Native 
American community at large, the Native American 
community of the Kumeyaay Nation, university faculty, 
the Office of the President, the La Jolla Historical 
Society, the Executive Architect and campus staff. 

“Our plans will be to disturb as little of the soil as 
possible, so we are not planning to ‘excavate the Indian 
artifacts,’” Piercey said. “We are working closely with 
Kumeyaay observers.”

The advisory group estimates that construction 
could start as soon as Fall Quarter 2011 and finish 
within a year. Rehabilitation of the house is believed to 
show the university’s respect for the Native American 
culture.

“Rehabilitation will allow UC San Diego to 
enhance, respect and celebrate the cultural and historic 
significance of the property in such a way that it 
maintains its integrity and the respect for the Native 
American community,” Piercey said.

Attorney at law Courtney Coyle — speaking on 
behalf of her client Carmen Lucas, a member of the 
Laguna Band Indians and a Native American monitor 

— expressed concerns regarding the project at a public 
hearing on Feb. 24. She said that the cultural precautions 
already set out may be insufficient, as Kumeyaay bones 
have previously been removed from the site.

“I feel that the university has hoped to let it decline 
and rot on purpose in place of filling it in,” community 

member Pat Granger said at the same 
meeting. 

When fixed, the house will also 
serve as a public reception forum for 
members and friends of the university. 

The university house is currently 
on the California Register of Historic 
Resources, the National Register of 
Historic Places and is classified as a 
sanctified Native American cemetery 
and sacred site. 

The environmental impact 
report draft is now available online. 
Public input based on the draft and 
its recommendations will continue 
through March 31.

The final report will be released 
in April and design approval will be 
determined in May.

The project and design plan will be 
submitted to the UC Board of Regents 

this spring. If the plan passes all stages of advisory board 
approval, construction will begin in Fall Quarter 2011.

According to Ratcliff, students will be able to 
purchase discounted presale tickets. The discounts will 
vary for each show. 

Students will also have the opportunity to intern 
with Nederlander in the areas of marketing, production 
and programming.  For the booking and programming 
internship, students will learn about concert promotion 
and contract negotiations. The production internship 
includes learning about technical aspects of shows, such 
as lighting and audio, and working with artists.

The details of internship positions are still being 
finalized, though Ratcliff expects the positions 
to be available during the 2011-12 academic year. 
Nederlander will work with A.S. Concerts & Events to 
create programs to incorporate students into activities 

around live shows.  
ASCE will act as an adviser to help create student 

events, Associate Vice President of Concerts and Events 
Brian Wong said. 

Nederlander will also consult ASCE to set ticket 
prices and presale dates. 

Per the agreement, student organizations may not 
partner with other promoters, such as Live Nation or 
Anschutz Entertainment Group, Wong said. He expects 
ASCE to partner with Nederlander in the future.

“The nature of RIMAC shows are difficult to do by 
ourselves, as there are lots of overhead [costs] to cover,” 
Wong said.   “Working with a partner would make it 
easier, so I see it being beneficial.”

path of sunrise and sunset prevent heat gain 
in the units, and windows facing west and 
south catch breezes, “scooping” air into the 
apartments and allowing natural light in. 

The 300-kilowatt solar water-heating 
system absorbs solar energy through solar 
collectors attached to rooftops and shade 
structures on 6 out of 7 buildings. 

Solar energy is transferred to non-drinkable 
water that flows to solar storage tanks, where 
heat is exchanged from the non-drinkable 
water to the drinkable water system.

“The most advanced feature of the Village 
II project is the solar water-heating system, 
which is one of the largest, if not the largest, 
installation at a North American university,” 
Aztec Solar CEO Ed Murray said in a 
statement. Aztec Solar helped install the solar 
water-heating system.

This qualifies UCSD for a cash rebate of 
up to $500,000 under the California Solar 
Initiative’s Thermal program. The project 
was funded solely by external financing via 
UC-issued bonds that will be repaid by student 
housing fees and from UCSD housing reserves.  

The Village II landscaping does not use 
drinkable water. Porous paving is used for 
walkway areas, and storm water will be filtered 
to maintain the landscape design in place of 
drinkable water before connecting to sewer 

mains. 
The cost of a single room for the 2011-12 

academic year is estimated at about $10,800, 
while it costs about $10,200 to live in a double 
room. All rooms come with a dining plan of 
$2,220 or approximately $8.41 per day. 

“The living arrangement is nice but it is 
expensive, Vanderberg said. “I think I’m done 
with the Village. I want to move off campus 
to save money. A lot of my friends have done 
that.”

According to Capitol Planning Director 
Cara Fladd, the Housing, Dining and 
Hospitality department’s goal is to house 
50 percent of all students on campus — a 
9-percent increase from the current 41 percent 
of the student population that lives on campus. 
Transfer students are guaranteed two years of 
housing at The Village.

The project is part of a four-year, $450 
million capital program bringing more 
housing campus. 

The Village I is the first housing on 
campus to provide single undergraduates 
with a 12-month housing option, as other 
on-campus residencies offer housing only for 
the academic year.

8 THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, MARCH 7, 2011 www.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG/fOCUS

E ast meets west in the onetime British colony of Hong Kong — a blooming metropolitan jungle set against the backdrop of traditional Chinese 
customs.

With a population of 7 million crammed between 
boundaries more compact than New York City’s, there’s no 
shortage of tourist attractions in this megalopolis. 

The city even has its own Hollywood Walk of Fame; 
called the Avenue of Stars, the boulevard pays tribute to 
local actors and Cantopop singers along the waterfront 
of Tsim Sha Tsui, which offers breathtaking panoramas of 
Hong Kong Island. 

There’s also plenty of coastline. The Repulse Bay  pro-
vides a view of high-rises on the hillsides — while Shek O, 
located some 20 kilometers from Central District, offers  a 
scenic escape from the city and an ideal spot to watch the 
surf roll in. 

Hong Kong has more than 600 Chinese temples, some 
of which date back over 700 years. The Tin Hau temple 
sports traditional Chinese architecture, but the more 
adventurous should climb 268 steps and gaze at the enor-
mous, 280-ton Tian Tan Buddha. The spectacular sight is 
more than worth a little exercise.

Don’t forget to drop in at the local Disneyland — the 
smallest park of the Magical Kingdom franchise — that 
was built with feng shui in mind. There’s also the Ocean Bay 

Park, a jellyfish aquarium that was one of the first places in 
the world to create new breeds of goldfish.

The culturally minded can learn more about the his-
tory of Hong Kong’s colonization at the Government House, 
which was used as the official residence of the governor 
during the 142 years Hong Kong was under British rule. The 
house is right across a zoo and botanical garden, if you feel 
like looking at things like pandas and butterflies. 

If you’re in the mood to shop, you’re in luck; malls and 
markets are everywhere around Tsim Sha Tsui. Wander in 
Western Market, an Edwardian-themed shopping complex 
specializing in local arts and crafts. 

For a more authentic taste of local retail, browse the 
Temple Street Night Market, where brightly lit stalls pawn 
off bargain-priced (though possibly counterfeit) clothes and 
electronics.

When it comes to the cuisine, nothing beats a sunny 
afternoon of dim sum and red bean vanilla milkshakes. Visit 
a wonton noodle shop or munch on some hotpot to save a 
few bucks, but splurge on roasted duck; both are easy finds, 
as are bakeries offering egg tart pastries, pineapple buns and 
glutinous rice dumplings. 

Hong Kong calls itself “Asia’s World City,” attracting 
hoards of tourists and businessmen alike. But be wary: that 
worldliness also makes it home to pickpockets and cabdriv-
ers who won’t think twice of swindling a wide-eyed visitor. 

Also, be sure to carry tissues and a windbreaker. Many 
indoor places and taxis set the air conditioning on full blast, 
even when it’s winter.

HONG KONG

I f you’re looking for shopping that’s a little more exciting than your local Westfield Shopping Center, head to Guatemala for handcrafted scarves that would put Hermes to shame. Textiles aside, Guatemala is also famous for its leather work and wood and ivory carvings. The markets at Puerto Quetzal are just as colorful as its namesake, the national bird. The streets are filled with vendors hawking hand-woven trea-sures from scarves to ornaments to tapestries. The exchange rate also doesn’t hurt: at press time, one dollar buys $7.78 GTQ, or Guatemalan Quetzal. At street markets, haggling is your best friend. After asking how much an item is, counter with half the quoted price. Dress appropriately for this endeavor: A camera strap around your neck won’t help your cause, so try your best to assimilate. 
Guatemala is also home to marimba music and an active nightlife. After the sun has set and your arms have tired of carrying overstuffed bags of souvenirs, free concerts and nightclubs offer a taste of how the locals like to party. 
 Be smart about exploring, particularly after dark. Central, well-lit areas are mostly good bets, since Guatemala may be less safe overall than American visitors are used to.
 But don’t let the crime stop you from enjoying the beautiful country and culture. Even if you’re not the biggest fan of avocado, you won’t want to miss out on the twist on a Mexican favorite: Thick, creamy and with an extra spicy kick, Guatemalan guac is unlike anything you’ll find at the nearby Chipotle. Just don’t forget to save room for flan de naranja — an orange-flavored flan that you’ll be hard-pressed to find anywhere stateside.

Guatemala

Y ellowstone National Park is the ideal destination for the traveler with a lot of time — and a lot of gas money. The preserve’s 3,472 square miles span three states (Wyoming, Montana and Idaho) and the vast terrain operates like a choose-your-own adventure novel, offering everything from geysers and mudpots to sheep, 
wolves, rodeos and the chance to eat waffles on a mountaintop. 

The best way to see the best of nature is with a $12-per-night camping pass, but there are plenty of cheap motels 
around; ignore the on-site accommodations, whose prices are double what you’ll find at lodgings just a mile away. 
And while nobody comes to Yellowstone for the dining, visitors can experience an “Old West cookout” or take the 
Jackson Hole Aerial Tram to enjoy waffles 4,000 feet from the ground, at the top of the Teton mountains. 

Yellowstone’s claim to fame is its beautiful scenery. The Upper Geyser Basin beholds Old Faithful, while the 
Mud Volcano is a squishy, sulfur-filled delight filled with sights such as the Dragon’s Mouth Spring, named because 
its water splashes across the walls like a tongue. Mammoth Hot Springs is a garden of limestone terraces and water-
falls, and all across the park roam herds of buffalo, as well as elk, grizzlies and antelope. 

The more adventurous can go fly-fishing or horseback ride through Montana while those who don’t want to get 
their hands dirty can visit nearby dinosaur and fossil museums. Entrance to Yellowstone costs $25 for seven days, 
but a week won’t be enough to explore America’s biggest nature reserve.

EUROPE

E ven with $10-a-night hostels, unlimited EuroRail passes and cheap prix-fixe menus, spending an extended amount of time in Europe can seem dauntingly expen-
sive. But fear not: While some parts of the continent fit the 
stereotype, you can have a lot of fun without dropping too 
much cash.

Overcrowded and overpriced though it may be, Paris is an 
essential stop. Beyond the conventional guidebook stops (most 
of which are wonderful nonetheless, the Musée d’Orsay in par-
ticular), Paris is home to a lot of young people (especially deep 
within the Left Bank) and still an epicurean’s dream. 

If you get off the train in time for dinner, an excellent 
(and little known) destination is L’Encrier, a small café in the 
crowded fourth arrondissement. There are only a few tables, so 
the wait might be long, but the food is an outstanding update 
of traditional French bistro cuisine, and €19 for a three-course 
menu is an excellent deal. 

If you’re looking for someplace to stay, you’re unlikely to 
find anywhere more French than the one-star Hôtel Baudan, 
where for €20 you can stay in a charming, somewhat run-
down early 20th-century apartment building. It’s not excep-
tionally clean, but the atmosphere is quaint, and the café 
downstairs serves great coffee.

No major European city, however, provides as much value 
as Berlin — particularly the city’s eastern Friedrichshain dis-
trict, the beer is cheap and the Turkish-German döner kebab 
stands cheaper. If you don’t mind a little kitsch, the Soviet 
era-esque hostel-boat Eastern Comforts (docked on the Spree 
river) has beds for €16.  

Perhaps the most essential sightseeing in Berlin is the 
majestic Museumsinsel, an island on the river Spree where all 
Berlin’s major arts and antiquities museums are located. But 
the real fun in Berlin occurs after dark in the city’s vibrant club 
scene, a large part of which can be found in Friedrichshain.

Another essential pocket-friendly city is Prague. If you can 
overlook the terrifying food and baffling language, Prague is 
one of the coolest, most fascinating cities in Europe. Hostels 
are absurdly cheap, and cleaner than you’d expect for the price. 

Prague is also home to the incredible Franz Kafka Museum, 
a beautiful, labyrinthine tribute to the city’s most famous 
writer. Also exceptional is the view from Prague Castle, the 
ancient city-center that rests on top of a large hill. And be sure 
to stock up on plenty of absinthe before you leave; Prague is 
one of the few places it’s made with real wormwood.

Rosarito

While many venture to Tijuana for the lure of underage intoxi-
cation, they’d be be better off heading 
a little further south to the tourist 
town of Rosarito. The city’s full of 
nightlife and a great place to hit the 
beach or surf — and, most impor-
tantly, the drinking age is still 18.

Getty Center

Located just north of UCLA off the 405, the Getty Center fea-
tures many well-known works of art, 
including Van Gogh’s “Irises.” The 
center also has a huge central garden, 
and is one of the most visited muse-
ums in the United States.

Salvation Mountain

P laced in the middle of nowhere near Niland, Calif., the sight was 
built by the eccentric Leonard Knight 
to spread his message: “God Is Love.” 
The project took over 100,000 gal-
lons of paint, and Knight lives on the 
“mountain” in a 1930s Chevy truck.

Anza Borrego

Barren desert at first sight, Anza Borrego has countless surprises 
to behold. Longer backpacking trips 
yield the best results, but there’s plen-
ty of wildlife, springs and caves to be 
found on day trips.

10 THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, MARCH 7, 2011 fOCUS

I f you’re a wimpy shopaholic, book your trip to Europe now — Australians have no sympathy for the faint of heart. It’s with good reason — Aussies live and thrive in the some of the toughest 
environments in the world. Their island is predominantly made up 
of a blistering, dry desert, where everything with a pulse can kill you 
(or will try its hardest to) and the legal drinking age is 18 (but really, 
16). In retrospect, it’s not so surprising that only 20 million (slightly 
more than half the population of California) have the swagger to 
survive the Aussie heat. 

Admittedly, the land down under doesn’t have a sufficient num-
ber of museums to rival New York or enough boutiques to compete 
with Paris (and frankly, you should skip the malls entirely — every-
thing is imported and marked up). But Sydney, arguably the cultural 
epicenter of Australia, boasts some of the most picturesque beaches 
and jaw-dropping architecture in the world (exhibit A: the Sydney 
Opera House, one of the most recognizable man-made icons.) 
Sydney is home to over 30 beaches, the most famous of which are 
Bondi and Coogee — where sparkling white sands match the crystal 
blue of ocean tide. If you feel like splurging, world-renown restau-
rant Tetsuya’s fresh, 11-course Japanese degustation menu is a hefty 
$210 AUD.  But times are hard (and the Australian dollar is strong 
— about $1.01 US dollars) so opt for some Thai or Vietnamese 
instead (available anywhere down under).  

Even in Australia’s biggest city, wildlife is abundant — though 
it’s mostly contained in one place.  Located across Darling Harbor from Sydney 
proper, the massive Taronga Zoo is home to every kind of furry (and scaly) pal 
there is — including the native koala. 

For the brave traveler, Australia’s desert, or the Red Center, is covered in 
rusty, blood-colored sand, speckled with prickly cacti and restless wildlife — a 
great departure from the bustle of a city metropolis. Throw down for a cheap 
hostel in Alice Springs  (you shouldn’t pay more than $20 a night) and take a 
three-day guided tour of an expanse of the arid land — circle the circumference 
of Ayer’s Rock, snap photos alongside camels and emus and listen to aboriginals 
talk about their cultural heritage — just watch out for poisonous snakes and 
dingos.  

If you prefer your deadly animals by the sea, head toward the Gold Coast 
to a town called Cairns (pronounced Cannes), located a short boat ride away 
from the Great Barrier Reef, the world’s largest reef system. Dive in — you’ll see 
electric blues, eye-popping yellows and crimson — and that’s just in one fish.

In Cairns, the old axiom “eat or be eaten” has never been truer. In beachside 
restaurants, you can find alligator (a flaky white meat), emu (akin to a gamier 
chicken) and kangaroo (best served medium rare).  But if you’ve had enough 
adventure, swing by a local grocery store (a Coles will do) armed with rainbow-
colored AUD and pick up a box of original Tim Tams (around $3 AUD a box).  
The smooth chocolate mousse sandwiched in between two cookies, coated in 
a hardened shell of chocolate pairs well with a mug of warm milk.  You’ll be 
hoarding them in your suitcase on the flight home.

T here’s a reason Barcelona is a top study abroad choice, and it’s not Cambridge-caliber aca-
demics.

Best known for the unorthodoxy 
of Gaudí’s Gothic architecture and a 
buzzing club scene that soldiers on past 
dawn, Barcelona offers the best of mod-
ern indulgence. Mom-and-pop baker-
ies bump shoulders with spirited bars 
and hole-in-the-wall shops on most 
every calle, many of which cater to the 
city’s booming tourist population. 

That’s the one downside to this 
Mediterranean port town: the secret’s 

out. Don’t be shocked to run into 
friends of friends during a weeknight 
FC Barcelona game at Camp Nou. 

Still, don’t let the crowds hold you 
back. Shy away from the city center’s 
most boisterous of tourist traps (Plaza 
Catalunya, the Ramblas) and a more 
authentic Catalan experience awaits. 
Artsy types take best to Gracia, an up-
and-coming district heavy on hipster 
boutiques. Gracia hosts scores of col-
lege-age natives, most of whom seek 
a lower-key alternative to the city’s 
brassy, house-dominated club scene. 

Gracia’s also home to the city’s 
greatest public attraction: the Gaudí-
designed Park Güell. Situated atop one 
of the city’s most scenic summits, the 
park offers unparalleled vistas of the 

city below, from the ubiquitous fruit 
adorning the peaks of the Sagrada 
Familia church to the congested slice 
of coastline at Barceloneta beach.

The city’s also a foodie’s paradise. 
Tapas — bite-sized servings of Spanish 
favorites — are king, though after one 
too many pitchers of Estrella, the tab 
adds up with surprising ease. 

Locals bearing the 9-to-5 grind will 
try to tell you that Barcelona isn’t the 
round-the-clock testament to hedo-
nism that everyone cracks it up to be. 

Don’t listen: a few rounds of san-
gria and a mid-morning stagger home 
from the club will provide a mighty 
authentic experience indeed.

A lmost all international flights to Honduras go through Tecontín International Airport, in the capital of Tegucigalpa. Tecontín is unfortunately one of the 
world’s scariest airports, featuring a last-minute hairpin turn 
onto a short runway. But once you get past the landing scare, the 
capital — the country’s modern political and economic heart — 
is worth exploring 

While Tegucigalpa is known as the nation’s economic life-
line, and the second-largest city — San Pedro Sula — is known 
for industry, La Ceiba on the Caribbean coast is the entertain-
ment center of Honduras. The city boasts a range of modern 
nightclubs and tiny bars, many of which produce their own 
alcohol from coconut and jungle roots. In early May, the La 
Ceiba Carnival honors the city’s patron saint, and as many as 

500,000 tourists pour in for the celebration.
La Ceiba is also renowned for its ecotourism, with Pico 

Bonito National Park just outside the city. The forested peak is 
only a few miles from the coastal city and towers nearly 8,000 
feet in the air, with the pale blue of the Caribbean providing a 
stark backdrop. Rio Coronjal, which runs through the east side 
of town, offers class III-V river rafting and there are several 
companies that offer guides to explore the nearby rain forests. 

The city is also the place to catch the ferry to Honduras’s 
major islands, Roatán and Utila. Roatán is famous for being in 
the middle of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef — the world’s sec-
ond largest, behind Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. Many tourists 
travel to Roatán for cheap scuba diving certification, and they 
find one of the world’s best locations to try out their new hobby. 

The island’s also loaded with history and folklore, with every-
one from Christopher Columbus to Captain Henry Morgan 
having a significant presence. Unlike the rest of Honduras, 

English is commonly spoken on the islands, which has aided the 
area’s tourism boom over the past two decades.  

Near the western Guatemalan border, the Copán ruins bear 
the remnants of a major Mayan city believed to have been at its 
peak from 150-900 A.D., with as many as 20,000 people living 
there. The ruins are extensive, with step-pyramids, palaces and 
even a ballcourt. 

For sports fans, Honduras is witnessing a golden age in soc-
cer: The national team made its second-ever World Cup appear-
ance in 2010. Major cities have multiple club teams, and cheap 
tickets make for a lively evening.

While Honduras certainly doesn’t lack natural beauty, it is 
poor country by American standards. Security can also be an 
issue, and it can be difficult to adjust to seeing policemen walk 
the streets with assault rifles. But if you travel smart, an eye-
opening introduction to Central America awaits.

T here’s no time like spring to visit the Land of the Rising Sun. Summers are muggy and there’s snow on the ground into the beginning of March, but 
early spring — with its cherry blossoms and festivals 
nationwide — hits a sweet spot. 

The best start is Tokyo, the nation’s capital. Landmarks 
like Tokyo Tower and the Rainbow Bridge, out-of-the-
box architecture (look for the giant golden radish on the 
city skyline) and areas like the Harajuku fashion district 
lend the city its world-renowned character.

When you’ve tired of the hustle and bustle, Tokyo is 
conveniently close to a number of nature-friendly day 
trips. A must-see are the famed hot springs of Hakone, 
only two hours outside the city by bus. Staying covered 
up in the onsen is offensive to locals, so only resort to a 
bathing suit if you’re too shy to bare it all.

And don’t be afraid to think outside the bento box. 
Japanese cuisine has a lot more to offer than sushi — be 
sure to try shabu-shabu (a hotpot) or okonomiyaki (a 
savory pancake). If you’re on the run, grab a 100-yen 
(roughly $1.20) onigiri for the road (satisfyingly filling 
balls of rice and fish wrapped in seaweed).

In the end, no matter how much hype Akihabara 
gets, most of Japan’s big cities have the same mix of 
porn shops and anime vendors. If you’re not on the 
hunt for a body pillow, it can get old fast. 

Fortunately, the country is littered with evidence 
of Japan’s rich history, and the centuries-old coexis-
tence of Shinto and Buddhist worship has created a 
stunning number of temples and shrines that warrant 
a visit. Take your Japanese phrasebook, hop on the 

Odakyu railway, and head to places like the coastal town 
of Kamakura, home to the Five Great Zen Temples.

Japan’s medieval history also left its mark in the form 
of fortresses. Though the most famed stops (Himeji or Matsumoto Castle) are ]air  from Tokyo, these 
restorations are worth visiting. At every Japanese monument, you’ll have to ditch your shoes when you 
get inside, but enduring the steep wooden stairs in bare feet makes the view even more spectacular.

A f t e r long hours spent memorizing bio terms at Geisel during finals, the 
call of the wild is strong. But since it’s against 
school policy to pitch tents on campus, your 
best bet for unleashing your inner moun-
tain man is to hit up California’s camp-
ing grounds, from woodsy Lake Tahoe to 
Malibu’s classic beach.

Although tent camping doesn’t have the typi-
cal spring break party appeal the way Cabo does, 
it’s easier on the pocket — as long as someone 
can dig a few sleeping bags out of their garage, 
your group’s main expenses will be gas and food. 
Thinking of it as the discovery channel version of 
MTV’s “Spring Break” doesn’t hurt either.  

Northern California

Tahoe
With over 15 different campgrounds and hun-

dreds of sites to pitch a tent  — not including the 
expansive wilderness around the lake for daring 
backpackers to traverse — Tahoe is California’s 
quintessential backcountry. Because of its high 
elevation, there may still be some snow on the 
ground in spring, so be sure to pack accordingly.

A good place to set up camp is Camp 
Richardson located just off Hwy 89. It has 220 
tent sites under pine trees and starry skies, with 
the convenience of full amenities like running 
water and toilets and a general store. This site has 
a no pets policy, but chances are you’ll be too busy 
with the squirrels and raccoons to miss Fido. 

Redwood National Park
Starting at the California-Oregon border and 

stretching for about 50 miles south, Redwood has 
developed and backcountry campgrounds, all on 
a first-come-first-served basis. In this idyll, home 
of the world’s tallest trees, spring is the rainy sea-
son and waterproof gear is recommended. 

For $35 a night, Elk Prairie Campground 
offers ancient coast redwoods, over 70 miles of 
hiking and biking trails, and up-close views of 
grazing Roosevelt elk and black-tailed deer, all 
with the convenience of hot showers, restrooms, 
fire pits, food lockers and picnic tables. 

Central California

Mammoth Mountain/June Lake
For camping a little closer to San Diego, take 

the 15 North to Hwy 395 North to Hwy 203 West 
to get to Mammoth Mountain.  Though it’s better 
known for its snow slopes than for camping, this 
Sierra Nevadan gem has dozens of campsites, hik-
ing and mountain biking trails, geological won-
ders like craters and volcanic rock formations, 
horseback riding and, of course, general wildlife 
opportunities.

Stay at Upper Rock Creek Campground (turn 
left at Tom’s Place off Hwy 395) about half an 

hour south of the mountain if you can’t make 
reservations for the mountain itself (there’s a hefty 
waiting list —people need to reserve six months 
in advance). Then, drive into Mammoth Lakes or 
June Mountain for day hikes, or visit the nearby 
mining ghost town of Bodie for a thrill. 

Death Valley
Desert wildflowers peak in late March, mak-

ing spring an ideal time to visit this notoriously 
hot locale. Furnace Creek Campground is $18 per 
night for water, tables, fireplaces, and toilets. But 
keep in mind that water is scarce even in winter 
months.

This national park has over 3 million acres 
of designated wilderness and, for diehards, the 
toughest hiking terrain California has to offer.  
Additionally, there are ranger-guided tours and 
a few museums at the park to offer something a 
break from battling the elements.  

Southern California

The Channel Islands
A national park 14 miles to the west of 

Ventura, the Channel Islands are recommended 
for experienced campers. Public boats provide 
access to the island year-round from Ventura and 
Channel Islands Harbors, but it’s harder to find a 
spot on a boat than it is a campsite. All five islands 
are open to camping, but Anacapa Island is the 
most popular ($10). No fires are allowed and 
trash cans, water and restrooms are not provided. 

Offsetting the inconveniences of primitive 
camping, high winds and wet weather, the islands 
are ideal for hiking, kayaking, diving, fishing, tide 
pooling, whale watching and surfing. And often 
a group of dolphins are there to escort your boat 
on the way over. 

Malibu
Leo Carillo State Beach is about 30 miles 

North of Santa Monica, off the Pacific Coast 
Highway (Hwy 1). The park has only about a mile 
and a half of coastline, but the main camping area 
extends across the freeway into a giant sycamore 
grove, where 133 sites are available. 

The beach offers some of the best swimming, 
surfing, windsurfing, and tide pools in the state, 
along with coastal caves and reefs for exploring. 
And for campers who don’t want to disappear off 
the grid altogether, wireless Internet is available 
within 200 feet of the camp store.

the game, and Pomona had 17 offensive 
rebounds. Pomona also held the advantage 
in bench scoring, 20-12. UCSD hasn’t been 
to the CCAA championship game since the 
2007-08 season. 

The Tritons finished league play with an 
impressive 17-5 record, but with a 20-11 
overall record, the Tritons — currently ranked 
ninth in the West Region are a long shot to 
receive a berth into the NCAA tournament. 
The Broncos — who went on to win the 
conference title against first-seeded Monterey 
Bay — will receive the automatic bid to con-
tinue to the tournament. 

UCSD started the season ranked 11th in 
the country, but quickly dropped out of the 
top 25 after a slow start. The Tritons went 2-7 
in their non-conference games, although two 
of the losses were to Division I opponents. 
The team got hot in the second half of the 
season, losing only once after Jan. 22.

Woofter and Rhiannon Ousley 
each had two RBI as the Triton 
offense exploded for 12 runs on 
15 hits. 

Lumberjack pitcher Vaneza

innings to take the loss.

Gaito (11-0) pitched all five

UC San Diego 12, 
Humboldt State 8

The Triton offense put up 
another 12 runs in the second 
half of the Saturday doublehead-
er, but shaky pitching almost 
allowed the Lumberjacks back in 
the game.

The Tritons posted the first 
three runs of the game in the 
bottom of the second, but the 
Lumberjacks answered with 

three of their own in the top of 
the third. Triton starter Jennifer 
Manuel couldn’t make it through 
the inning, finishing her day with 
a line of five hits and three runs 
allowed on 2.2 innings pitched. 
Tess Granath came in to relieve 
her.

The Tritons came right back 
with five runs in their half of 
the fifth, but a grand slam by 
Felicia Viveiros tied the game 8-8. 
Despite having pitched the morn-
ing game, Gaito (12-0) entered as 
a reliever to settle things down, 
and didn’t allow a hit in 1.2 
innings to finish the game. 

UCSD put up four runs in the 
bottom of the sixth, with two RBI 
apiece from Nicole Spangler and 
Charly Swanberg. 

The Tritons are now 19-3 
overall and 13-2 in the CCAA, 
and remain first place in the con-
ference. The team will be on the 
road for the next five weeks, start-
ing with a series against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills beginning on 
March 11.

game to get their first win against 
UCSD since April 27, 2008. 

Simmons lasted just one 
inning, giving up three runs on 
four hits and facing nine bat-
ters. After starting the season 
2-0, Simmons hasn’t lasted more 
than four innings in any of his 
last three starts. Justin Burns 
(1-1) came in to relieve, and gave 
up two runs on five hits in 5.1 
innings. Burns also surrendered 
the go ahead run, giving him the 
loss.

Down 3-2 in the fifth, Saul led 
off the inning by getting hit by a 
pitch. Saul advanced to second, 
then third, on two groundouts, 
then was brought out on an RBI 
single by Tagmyer. However, the 
Gators responded right away, with 
an infield single bringing in the 
go-ahead run in the top of the 
sixth. San Francisco State added 
an insurance run in the seventh to 
seal the win.

The Tritons used a 10-run 
eighth inning to pick up a win 
and take three of four from San 
Francisco State.

With the score tied 3-3 going 
into the bottom of the eighth, the 
Triton offense unloaded, with dou-
bles from Danny Susdorf, Aaron 
Bauman, Nick La Face, Garrett 
Tuck and K.C. Rentfro. La Face’s 
double came with the bases loaded 
and plated all three runners — the 
first RBI of La Face’s career. 

Elias Tuma (2-0) pitched 3.1 
innings of relief, giving up two hits 
and no runs to pick up the win.

The Tritons are now 15-5 over-
all and 8-4 in the CCAA. The 
Tritons will travel to Cal State 
Dominguez Hills for games on 
Thursday and Friday before 
returning home for a doublehead-

March 4

UC San Diego 7, San Francisco State 1

Ace Tim Shibuya (5-0) struck out a career-
high 11 batters in eight innings of solid work, 
and four Tritons tallied RBI as UCSD took the 
first game of the four-game series.

The Tritons put up four runs in the first 
inning and didn’t look back. Blake Tagmyer 
had a two-run single with the bases loaded, and 
Tagmyer and Kellen Lee scored on an error by 
the Gators’ second baseman. UCSD added two 
more runs in the fourth inning, with an RBI 
double from Evan Kehoe and a sac fly by Nick 
La Face to bring in Kehoe. San Francisco State 
got its only run in the sixth inning off an RBI 
double. 

Aside from his 11 strikeouts, Shibuya allowed 
one run on six hits while walking none. Eric 
Abraham pitched the ninth inning and didn’t 
allow a hit. Tagmyer went two-for-three with 
two runs and two RBI, while Kehoe was two-
for-four with two RBI and a run. Aaron Bauman 
went three-for-four with a run and an RBI. 
Despite the strength of the game offensively, the 

Tritons struck out 11 times in the game.

UC San Diego 10,  San Francisco State 2

Kyle Saul had three RBI and Evan Kehoe 
went 4-for-4 as the Tritons effortlessly took the 
first game of the doubleheader on Saturday. 

After a scoreless first inning, the Tritons 
posted five runs in their half of the second, with 
two RBI apiece from Saul and K.C. Rentfro. 
Saul also scored on an error by the Gator center 
fielder. Ten different Tritons accounted for 14 
hits in the game.

Guido Knudson (3-1) pitched seven score-
less innings to pick up the win.

UC San Diego 6, Humboldt State 2

Kris Lesovsky launched a three-run home 
run in the bottom of the fifth to break a 2-2 tie, 
and the Tritons used another strong start from 
Camille Gaito (10-0) to take the first game of a 
four-game series with Humboldt.

Gaito gave up a leadoff home run to start the 
game, and gave up an RBI single in the second 
inning. But Gaito only allowed three hits and 
no runs after that, and the Tritons tied the score 
in their half of the second with an RBI single 
from Taylor Sepulveda and an illegal pitch with 
the bases loaded. The next batter, Mya Romero, 
struck out swinging to end the inning with the 
bases still juiced. The Tritons left 14 runners on 
base in the game.

Lesovsky was one-for-one with the home 
run, but drew four walks and scored twice. Her 
homer was the 21st in her career, second-most 
in school history.

March 4 (GaMe 2)

Humboldt State 9, UC San Diego 4

Tess Granath had a rough start, giving up 
seven runs in 1.2 innings as Humboldt ended 
the Tritons’ seven-game winning streak. 

Granath gave up four runs on four hits in 
the first, then three runs on four hits in the sec-
ond before being taken out for Jennifer Manuel. 
Manuel gave up two runs the rest of the way, 
but the Tritons couldn’t dig themselves out of 
the early hole. 

March 5 (GaMe 1)

UC San Diego 12, Humboldt State 2

Seven different Tritons had RBI as UCSD 
won the first game of Saturday’s doubleheader 
after five innings via the mercy rule.

Nicole Spangler was 3-for-4 with a run and 

“[LeFever’s] time in the hurdles is excellent, 
14.18 is a very, very good 100-meter hurdle 
time,” Ahner said. “She looks really great, she 
just had a dynamite day.”

Coming off a massive 193’4” throw last 
week at the Rossi Relays, senior Danielle 
Thu once again won the hammer throw. This 
week she competed with a heavier training 
hammer, but still won by over 20 feet with a 
throw of 173’8”. Thu was also second in the 
discus, while sophomore teammate Uchenna 
Agbahiwe placed third, and both threw pro-
visional qualifying marks. Agbahiwe’s mark is 
10th all-time at UCSD.

Junior Caitlin Meagher won the 400-meter 
hurdles with a time of 1:02.74, good for an 
provisional qualifying mark.

Senior Theresa Richards took the javelin 
throw for the second consecutive week with a 
mark of 128’8”.

The Triton men also excelled in the throw-
ing events, taking victories in three of the 
four events. Sophomore Ryan Eckert took the 
shotput (48’8.75”) and sophomore Zachary 
Nagengast won the discus (149’9”). Junior Ab 
Shaheen, who is the Lebanese national record 
holder in the hammer throw, easily won the 

event with a toss of 180’1”, good for sixth best 
all-time at UCSD. The Tritons couldn’t take 
the javelin, although the defending national 
champion in the event — junior Nick Howe 
— only competed in high jump for the Tritons 
on the day. 

Junior Roger Huang placed first in the 800 
with a time of 1:58.55, while junior Ka Wai Ng 
won the triple jump with a mark of 46’8”.

The Tritons also won both 4x400 relays, 
with a time of 3:26.00 for the men and 3:53.27 
for the women.

In total, the Tritons had nine updates to the 
all-time top 10 lists for the meet.

“I, of course, know they are capable of so 
much,” Ahner said. “But it was a little bit sur-
prising to have all the provisional qualifiers, 
the nine updates on the top-10 lists, and the 
school record, all in an early season meet. I’m 
really excited about how they’re competing. I 
really feel there is a lot of energy on the team.” 

The Tritons will travel to Irvine next 
Saturday for the All-Cal Championships. 
The distance runners will compete in the 
Occidental Distance Carnival on Friday.

Nine Updates to Top-10 Lists in City Meet

Tritons Set Attendance Mark but Fall to Cardinal
after losing [set two],” Ring said. “Which was 
disappointing because that’s a position we put 
ourselves in, down two games to zero that we 
felt should have been tied 1-1. We had to come 
out and give a better effort out there in game 
three. But it was a bad night; it wasn’t our night. 
They played really well and got better as the 
match went on, and we did not match that.”

Stanford took on UCSD with a record 
crown of 1,012 spectators at RIMAC Arena. 
The set scores were 25-22, 22-25, 25-21 and 
25-17. The Tritons played a better game than 
the previous night, hitting at .272, but could 
not match up to the .369 hitting percentage 
from the Cardinals.

“We came out for game three and got off to 
a really slow start,” Ring said. “They’re jump-
float servers, and they’re not going to miss, so 
we’ve got to earn those sideouts.”

The Tritons fell behind early in game four, 

and didn’t threaten to force a game five.
“Game four, we came out and kind of back 

down a little bit,” Ring said. “Mid-to-late in 
that game we had attack errors, service errors. 
And that’s on us. We missed some serves and 
attacks late in that game that really opened it 
up for Stanford.” 

Sophomore outside hitter Carl Eberts led 
the Tritons with 15 kills and a .429 attack per-
centage. Sophomore libero Chase Frishman 
collected a match-high 14 digs. Senior outside 
hitter Joel Davidson saw 11 kills and junior 
opposite Shane Veiga got 10.

The two losses bring the Tritons to 6-14 
overall and 3-11 in MPSF matches.

The Tritons hit the road this weekend 
for matches against No. 1 USC and No. 9 
Pepperdine.

Faynan, located near the beautiful Dana UNESCO Biosphere 
Reserve, is home to one of the world’s best preserved an -
cient mining and metallurgy districts.  Since 1997, UC San 
Diego has worked closely with the Department of Antiquities 
of Jordan on a deep-time, nine thousand year long, study of 
the role of mining and metallurgy on cultural evolution – from 
the Neolithic period to Islamic times.  The project is called the 
Edom Lowlands Regional Archaeology Project or ELRAP.  The 
2011 season will be devoted to exploring the social and po -
litical evolution of the Iron Age (ca. 1200 – 900 BCE)  king -
dom of Edom known from the Old Testament and ancient 
Near Eastern texts. The ELRAP project is special because 
it is at the center of using a high-tech on-site GIS digital ar -
chaeology system.  Students gain extensive experience not 
only participating in archaeological survey and excavation, but

CCaa tournament

The UCSD women’s basketball team’s con-ference tournament run came to an end on Friday in a heart-wrenching 75-78 
semifinal loss against Cal Poly Pomona.

The second-round conference matchup 
marked the third time the Tritons have met 
with the Broncos this season, and the third time 
Pomona — the only team to have swept UCSD in 
conference play — has gotten the win. Pomona 
beat the Tritons 60-51 on Feb. 24, just eight days 
before the tournament game. 

The Tritons seemed to do everything right, 
as their leading scorers, junior guard Chelsea 
Carlisle and junior center Lauren Freidenberg, 
delivered. Freidenberg finished with 19 points 
and eight rebounds, and Carlisle had 17 points, 
although it was on 7-for-21 shooting.  The Tritons 

shot a respectable 48 percent from the field, and 
got help from the bench, with junior shooting 
guard Daisy Feder going 3-of-6 from behind the 
arc.

But despite a solid showing, the Tritons still 
had no answer for league MVP Reyana Colson. 
The Bronco senior guard went 11-of-22 to finish 
with 26 points. She was helped by junior forward 
Megan Ford, who posted a double-double with 20 
points and 13 rebounds.

UCSD maintained control for most of the 
first half and deep into the second period. Eight 
minutes into the second half, the Tritons led 
by as many as 13 points eight minutes into the 
second half, outscoring the Broncos 21-11 in the 
first seven minutes of the period. But three con-
secutive three-pointers from Bronco guard Sarah 

Semenero brought Pomona to within one point. 
The Broncos then took the lead in the next pos-
session, after hitting a pair of free throws.

From there, Colson and Ford took control, 
forcing Triton turnovers and combining to score 
12 of the next 14 points for the Broncos. Ford 
scored 14 points in the second half. 

With 26 seconds remaining, the Tritons cut 
down a five-point Bronco lead with a jumper by 
Carlisle, followed by a rebound by Freidenberg, 
bringing the game to 76-75.  But Ford sunk a pair 
of free throws to extend the lead in the next pos-
session, and Carlisle’s three at the buzzer finished 
the Tritons off.

The Tritons were outrebounded 37-27 for

Strong SHowing For UCSD

Kelly Fogarty ran 23.79 in the 200m, breaking her 
own school record in the event.

TRACK & FIELD — The women’s team won ten 
events while the men’s team took six events, and the 
UCSD track and field teams swept the San Diego 
Collegiate Challenge on their home track on Saturday. 
This was the fourth straight year that UCSD won both 
the men’s and women’s competitions, with the meet 
was previously called the San Diego City Collegiate 
Championships. This year’s meet included San Diego 
area community colleges for the first time. 

“There was enough competition out there to be 
challenged, but certainly it was a great confidence 
builder,” women’s coach Darcy Ahner said. “In some 
ways it was a low-key meet, but they went out there 
with a fire and just performed. It was really nice to see.”

Senior Kelly Fogarty provided the highlight of the 
day with a blistering 23.79 time in the 200-meter dash. 
The mark broke her own school record of 23.96, and 
is an NCAA automatic qualifier. Fogarty also hand-
ily won the 100-meter dash with a time of 11.82, an 
NCAA provisional qualifying time.

Senior Stephanie LeFever also had a huge day, help-
ing the 4x100 team to victory and winning three indi-
vidual events. LeFever won and set personal bests in 
the 100-meter hurdles (14.18) and high jump (5’7.25”), 
and took long jump (18’10.5”) as well. The mark for the 
100-meter hurdles is a provisional qualifer.

skid Continues for Tritons

The Tritons have now dropped six matches in a row after losses 
to Pacific and Stanford this weekend.

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — The UCSD 
men’s volleyball team continued its six-
match skid this weekend, getting swept 
by University of the Pacific on Friday 
before losing 1-3 to Stanford on Saturday. 

Against Pacific, the set scores were 
25-19, 31-29 and 25-19. Neither team had 
a great night, but with the Tigers hitting 
at .268 and the Tritons at .155, and a dif-
ference of 10.5 to 5.0 blocks in favor of 
Pacific, the game ended quickly. 

Despite a one-point lead in the first 
set at 15-14, the Tritons were smashed 
by a five-point run from the Tigers and 
could not recover the lead. Game two 
stayed close with Tritons forcing extra 
points to be played, but Pacific pulled 
out a series of kills that won the game 
for them.

“We played a much better game two, 
we were up 18-14, 20-15, and you have 
to win that,” head coach Kevin Ring said.  
“And we just did not close; we didn’t com-
municate well on court. We finished with 
some attack errors, which were costly.” 

The Tigers took a 16-8 lead in the 
third set and did not look back. 

“We played deflated in game three,
