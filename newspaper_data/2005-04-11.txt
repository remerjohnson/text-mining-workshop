Service 
workers to 
hold strike 

By BENJAMIN BARTLETT 
Senior Staff Writer 

University of California ser-
vice workers represented by the 
American Federation of State 
County and Municipal Employees 
will hold a one-day strike April 14 
in protest of the university'S stance 
in recent negotiations between the 
two parties. 

"This strike is being held 
because the workers in the ser-
vice unit have seen no meaningful 
movement by the university," said 
Paul Worthman, the union's chief 
negotiator. "The purpose is to send 
a message of concern and commit-
ment to the university." 

The university, however, has 
called the strike premature. 

"We sympathize and understand 
their feelings," UC Office of the 
President labor relations spokes-
man Noel Van Nyhuis said. "But 
the assertion that UC bargains in 
bad faith is pretty disingenuous -
to announce [that] after declaring 
a strike before negotiations have

An emotional Student

Christopher Sweeten claimed 
the position of president of 
Associated Students, leading 
his nearest opponent by more 
than 12 percent. As a whole, the 
slate won every executive race in 
which it competed. 

"I think that [the results] 
show that the students were

Slates promise solidarity, 
teamwork in fonning policy 

By CHARLES NGUYEN 
Staff Writer 

Although newly elected execu-
tive members of the A.S Council 
will be split among the Revolution ! 
and Student Empowerment! slates, 
the executives have pledged their 
commitment to teamwork and soli-
darity in the upcoming year. 

Seven of the 10 executive A.S. 
positions will be filled by Revolution! 
candidates next year. However, all 
three Student Empowerment! slate 
candidates running for top posts 
were elected to .their positions. T he 
slate's president-elect, Christopher 
Sweeten, won by a 5()()-vote margin. 

Despite the slate division, many 
new officials are familiar with their 

future co-workers. Tn last year's 
election, Revolution! and Student 
Empowerment! candidates competed 
on a single slate called Students First!. 
Familiarity between executives will 
reinforce council solidarity, accord-
ing to Revolution! Commissioner of 
Communications-elect Soap C hwn. 

"If you look at all the execs, 
these are all Students First! peo-
ple," he said. "I'm excited - I 
ran with many of these people last 
year ... so it doesn 't seem like the 
dynamic will be any different. If it 
was going to be different, we wou ld 
have seen a crazy election year, but 
it went pretty smooth."

Strike: University promises 
services will not be disrupted 

continued from page I 
been completed." 

The temporary strike will 
involve more than 7,300 workers 
across the UC system, impact-
ing services like preparation and 
delivery of food, cleaning of 
dorms and bathrooms and the 
maintenance of buildings. 

In addition to the strike, ser-
vice workers, joined by local com-
munity and religious leaders, will 
be picketi ng throughout the day 
and night, said Robert Hardrick, 
a senior UCSD building mainte-
nance worker who serves on the 
executive board of the union's 
Local 3299. 

"This is a one-day strike to 
show tha t we are one union, 
together, working for a better 
cause," Hardrick said. "We are 
going,to do everything in our 
power to negotiate the best con-
tract for our workers - we will 
do whatever it takes to accom-
plish our goals." 

University officials have prom-
ised that the strike will not disrupt 
services to students and patients. 

"Each of the campuses and 
medical centers will access their 
own needs to ensure that srudents 
and patients receive the care and 
services they need," Van Nyhuis 
said. "We'll do whatever it takes 
to ensure that services go on." 

Despite Van Nyhuis' assur-
ance, the steps taken by UCSD in 
preparation for the strike remain 
unknown. 

For example, at this point, 
no extra staff has been hired in 
anticipation of the strike, accord-
ing to campus Director of Strategic 
Communications Dolores Davies. 

The recent decision to strike 
has followed the continued failure 
of talks between the university 
and union to renegotiate the ser-
vice workers' contract. 

The two parties reached an 

impasse last month and, in accor-
dance with state law, a fact-finding 
panel was formed to make rec-
ommendations to each side. After 
the release of the panel's report, 
however, a deadlock in negotia-
tions ensued, and on April 4, the 
workers' union issued a letter to 
the university notifying administra-
tors of the strike. The fact-finding 
panel's results will not be made 
public until later this week. 

Some of the biggest issues 
still in contention are guaranteed 
wages for service workers, the 
right to wear uniforms not made 
in swea tshops and the opportuni-
ty to fill vacancies in higher-level 
positions with in-house union 
employees, Worthman said. 

The university has cited sev-
eral years of state budget short-
falls for the inability to guarantee 
these changes. 

"To fund what the union is 
asking for would cost over $36 
million," Van Nyhuis said. "We 
have tried to reward our employ-
ees in other ways, with a sal-
ary-based health care program 
and fwO extra paid holidays, but 
ultimately, it's state funds that 
govern budget increases." 

Union officials have denied 
the university'S claim, however. 

"The percentage of money 
we get from the state is zero to 
none," Hardr ick said. "We know 
that the money is out there, they 
just don't want to give it to us." 

A budget proposed by Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger has 
promised greater state funding 
for the university in the 2005-06 
fiscal year. These funds would 
allow the university to provide 
pay raises to all UC employees, 
including those in service jobs, 
Va n Nyhuis said.

I ETCETERA ••• 

I BRIEFLY 
Revolution! to 

withdraw complaint 
The Revolution! slate INiIi INithdraw 

its complaint filed against AS. Elections 
Manager Steve Yort with the campus-
wide judicial board. The filing asked the 
board to ovenule the disqualification of 
Phil Mikelatos, the slate's candidate for 
Earl Warren College junior senator, who 
was found ineligible to compete after 
failin8 to meet the minimum grade 
reqUi rements. 

Earlier this year, the AS. Council 
made changes to the eligibil-
ity standards for campus candidates. 
Previously, regulations required can-
didates to maintain "good academic 
standing"; changes now require stu-
dents to maintain a minimum CPA 
of 2.0. However, similar provisions at 
Warren did not mirror the changes to 
the AS. elections bylaws, according to 
Harry Khanna, the slate's vice presi-
dent of academic affairs-elect. 

Though Mikelatos' grades dropped 
below the minimum average, the 
appeal argued that he still maintained 
"good academic standing." as required 
by the Warren bylaws. Because the 
Warren Elections Committee had pri-
mary jurisdiction over the matter, the 
college's requirements superseded 
campuswide statutes, it argued. 

However, Khanna said the slate 
decided to INithdraw the complaint 
before it was heard by the judicial 
board, after Mikelatos came in third 
in the race. He received 21 percent 
of votes, or nearly half of the num-
ber ~amered by the winner, SunGod 
Party s Kevin Hsu. 

Disqualified ERe 
candidate led in votes 

Roosevelt Dynamite's candidate to 
become Eleanor Roosevelt College's 
sophomore senator, Julie Sepulveda, 
posted a sizeable lead over her oppo-

nen~ despite an earty-week ruling 
from the Roosevelt Judicial Board dis-
qualifying her slate from the election. 

Sepulveda was the only candi-
date on the five-person slate to end 
INith leading numbers and the sole 
Dynamite member competing for a 
seat on the AS. Council. Sepulveda 
received a total of 43 percent of the 
votes, while her opponent Rebecca 
Frampton gamered 26 percent. More 
than 3 I percent of voters chose to 
abstain in the race. Frampton was 
announced the INinner. 

In an .A{>ril 9 ruling. the Roosevelt 
Elections Committee voted with no dis-
sention to disqualify the slate for violat-
ing the col~e's by1aws goveming vol-
untary spending limits. A complaint filed 

~ the committee alleged that the slate 
did not tuln in receipts or estimates for 

all of its materials p~or to-campaigning. 
in violation of the bylaws. 

The judicial board voted unani-
mously against overtuming the ruling. 

Because the decision came after 
voting was in progress, elections staff 
could not take the candidate's name 
off the ballot Advertisements and an 
announcement at polling stations on 
wamed voters that the slate had been 
disqualified and that any votes for its 
candidates would not be counted. 

ACLU protests school-
'related prayer 

The Louisiana Civil Liberties Union 
has recommended that New Orleans 
public school officials be.fined or jailed 
for failing to stop a prayer broadcast 
over the School's public announcement 
system before a march baseball game. 

In March, the state's ACLU asked a 
judge to hold the same school district 
in contempt for alloNing an elementary 
school student to recite a prayer before 
the school board's meeting. Over the 
last 1 0 years, the organization has filed 
three lawsuits against the district. 

In August the school board si~ned 
a voluntary court judgment promising 
to end the invocations prior to athletic 
and other school-sponsored events. 

'It is time to put out the welcome 
mat to believers and nonbelievers 
alike at all public school functions 
across the state and the nation," 
stated Joe Cook, executive director of 
the state's ACLU, in the group's press 
release. 'Children and parents whose 
beliefs are different from the majority 
must not be made to feel like outsid-
ers in their own schools." 

The district has ar~ued that it 
should not be liable In this case 
because the prayer was not led by a 
school employee. 

1his assauk on religious freedom 
is yet another example of the ACLU's 
crusade to eradicate any public recog-
nition of America's spiritual heritage." 
stated Tony Perkins, president of the 
conservative Family Research Council. 
"I applaud the students, parents and 
school board for standing firm in the 
face of ... intimidation and threats: 

One state college 
among digital leaders 

Only one Califomia community 
college was among the top 30 Digital 
Community Colleges selected for rec-
ognition in a survey by the Center for 
Digital Education and the American 
Association of Community CoIleg~.

three categories. The Pleasant Hill-based 
Diablo Valley CoIleRe was ranked fourth

Eledion: Election turnout up from last year 
cominued from page I 

because we are from the students." 
Presidential candidates who ran 

against Sweeten offered their sup-
port for the president-elect. 

"I just hope that Chris can lead 
this school. ... If I didn't vote for 
myself, 1 would've voted for him," 
independent candidate Keshav 
"Kiki" Boddula said. ''I'd much 
rather have him win than Kevin 
Ha nson or Daniel Watts." 

Boddula came in fourth in the 
race, with support from fewer vot-
ers than those choosing to abstain. 

The SunGod Party slate, while 
losing all executive races in which 
it competed, posted a second-place 
finish in the presidential race with 
candidate Watts. Watts, whose 
platform focused on a second Sun 
God festival and stricter fiscal disci-
pline in the A.S. Council, credited 
his placing in the race to the "aver-
age voter." 

"I knew Chris would win," he 
said. "He had an unshakable core 
of supporters." 

Watts said he hopes the number 
of supporters he gathered will still 
help to shape policy in the coming 
year, especially in moving the council 
to adopr instant runoff voting, one of 
his pet policy objectives. 

"J'm happy. I got second place, 
and that's not bad," Watts said . "I 
love this school, and I loved talking 
to people. I hope that Chris and 
the other people who won take a 
look at how many votes I got when 
they plan things for next year." 

The Revolution ! slate won the 
remaining seven executive positions 
in which Student Empowerment! 
did not compete, includi ng Angela 
Fomero for vice president internal 
and Greg Murphy for vice presi-
dent finance. The slate' presiden-
tial candidate, Kevin Hanson, came 
in third in the race. 

"Sure, I wish I would have come 

in first or second, and of course 
I'm a little bit disappointed . .. but I 
think thar Chris will continue with 
his strong work ethic and ability to 
get things done," Hanson said. 

Amid his electoral success, 
however, Sweeten spoke somberly 
about the failure of the Developing 
Opportuni ties through O utreach 
and Retention Services fee refer-
endum. The initiative lost hand-
ily, with 47.4 percent of students 
voting against it and 35.4 percent 
voting in favor. T he only other 
referendum on the ballot, which 
proposed a reform to the represen-
tation structure of the A.S. council, 
also fai led. 

"We need to get out there more 
for next year and really put those 
referenda back on the ballot because 
(they're) crucial on the basis that 
we're affecting the communities of 
San Diego," Sweeten said. 

Regardless of the vote, both 
resolutions needed a turnout of at 
least 20 percent to be considered. 
However, only 19.86 percent of eli-
gible studenis voted, according to 
A.S. Elections Manager Steve York. 
The number translates to a 2-percent 
increase from the year before and 
almost a 3-percent jump from 2003. 

The D.O.O .R.S fee referendum 
proposed increasing the ASUCSD 
student activity fee by $3 per under-
graduate student. Funds generated 
by D .O.O.R.S. would have gone to 
the Student-Initiated Outreach and 
Recruimlem Center and other out-
reach programs such as high school 
confercnces to promote access to 
higher education for underrepre-
sented groups. 

Because of accounting confu-
sion, candidates believed that turn-
out had hit the minimum 20-per-
cent mark with 21 minutes left 
on the last day of voting. The 
news generated cheers from all 
three slates - all of which backed 

D.O.O.R.S. - with members of 
the slates taking a break from cam-
paigning on Library Walk to hug 
each other and shake hands. 

The announcement of the fail-
ure of the referendum also generat-
ed an emotional response through-
out the slates. 

"I think that if we had thar ref-
erendum, we could have had more 
programs and student-initiated out-
reach that goes to high schools," 
Commissioner of Diversity Affairs-
elect Eiko Arseniak said. "I hope that 
we can still work together to bring 
more student-initiated outreach to 
schools." 

Supporters of D.O .O.R.S. from 
all slates blamed the loss of the ref-
erendum on a lack of campaigning. 

The failure of the A.S. restruc-
ture referendum was much less of 
a surprise to candidates. The ballot 
item proposed a change to the senate 
structure of the A.S. Council, creat-
ing six campuswide elected sena-
tors and six A.S.-appointed fresh-
man senators. The proposal aimed to 
improve student representation. 

"I feel it was a rushed referen-
dum, and for that reason it failed," 
Hanson said. 

Last-minute surges in voting 
generated a jump in participation 
on the final day of the election. 

Thurgood Marshall College 
senior Renee Holiday finished 
voring on Library Walk four 
minutes before the end of the 
election. 

"Honestly, r felt compelled when 
a srudent finally showed his passion 
and said, ' [f this school sucks, it's 
your fault, '" Holiday said.

Senior Staff Writer 

W ith all the hoopla over a second Sun God out of the way, the incoming 
A.S. Council will have some free 
time to worry about the real issue 
their constituents care about stu-
dent parking. Unfortunately, just as 
councilmembers are about to roll up 
their collective sleeves and fight for 
the student good, they will be hand-
somely rewarded with an impressive 
collection of "A" and "B" parking 
pennits ("A" pennits for the presi-
dent and the four vice presidents, 
and "B" pennits for commission-
ers and the senate chair), and they 
will not utter another word about 
parking until election promises roll 
around for next year. 

Incoming president Christopher 
Sweeten has the least to lose by 
ignoring student parking concerns. 
As A.S. president, he receives a 
faculty "A" permit - the holy grail 
of parking privileges - an experi-
ence derued to all students, except 
for certain circumstances involv-
ing private re-enactments of the 
1969 film "The Graduate." This 
presidential privilege to park any-
where at any time has led numer-
ous people to run for president 
- including this author, who ran 
for that specific reason three years 
ago - but what it hasn't done is 
compel any executive action on the 
issue of improving student parking 
for at least the last five years. 

Sure, legions of student poli-
ticians have taken the small 
~improvements" spoon-fed to them 
by Transportation and Puking 
Services and claimed them as stu-
dent-irutiated victories, but for the 

most part, it's clear who wears the 
pants in the relationship between 
the A.S. Council and T&PS. 

Despite the realities of political 
bribery, there exists a mechanism 
for improving student parking; a 
representative chosen by the A.S. 
Council is permitted to sit on the 
Transportation Policy Committee 
and voice the opinion of the stu-
dents in regard to parking facili-
ties. And despite the fact that the 
proper expression of opiruon on 
the students' part on this mat-
ter involves heavy artillery, A.S. 
Council representatives have been 
entirely subservient, failing to use 
even their modicum of power. And 
why should they? If they are an A.S. 
executive, their "B" parking permit 
gives them no personal reason to 
care about the realities of "S" spots 
or Cityshuttle commuters. 

Those who doubt the integrity 
of the A.S. Council on the issue 
of parking should try this simple 
experi ment: take away executive 
parking privileges for a week, and 
force the entire council to com-
mute like the rest of the student 
body. Let the A.S. president sit 
in a parking lot for forty minutes 
waiting for a vacancy to avoid the 
equally long line at the East Parking 
shuttle. After a few days of missing 
every meeting and trouncing every 
deadline, one would see a swift and 
potent condemnation of T&PS on 
a biblical scope. After passing six 
separate resolutions, the entire A.S. 
Council would then take to the 
street and riot, burning their "S" 
permits like draft cards and form-
ing human barriers to halt access to 
every ~ A" spot on campus. 

And it is for this exact reason 
that T&PS pays off every executive

count how many lots are being swal-
lowed by the ~A"-spot beast). while 
simultaneously using these construc-
tion efforts to justify raising the cost 
of student parlcing perrruts. 

Any nonbribed A.S. Council 
member could be quid to point 

out that the rising costs of parking 
permits should be proportional to 
the construction costs related to 
new student lots, but, for obvi-
ous reasons, this empathy toward 
student commuters is completely 
absent ftom the equation. 

Of course, the tactic of bribery 
and deception in the A.S. Council 
is not only limited to the scope of 
parking. Concerning the topic of 
rising student fees, the A.S. Council 
appears to be fighting very diligent-
ly to lobby for lower student fees 
to allow equal access to education 
for all. This single claim was the 
lynch pin of the wildly successful 
Student Empowerment

' 
slate that 

won all spots its candi"dates ran for. 
Some call these lobbying trips to 
Washington, D.C. and Sacramento 

~vacations, .. but in reality, they are 
more like migrant labor marches. 
Working on less than two hours of 
sleep a night, these lobbying politi-
cians scream their little he2rtS out by 
day and scheme by night to com-
pete with multimiIlion-doll~ lobby-
ing interests fighting for the atten-
tion of the same national or state 
politicians. 

Yet, back home at UCSD, the 
single greatest link the A.S. Council 
has to stem the tide of rising student 
fees is being handsomely paid off to 
the rune ofS800 per quarter for two 
quarters (Winter and Spring). You 
read that correctly: TheA.S. Council 
representative to the Registration 
Fee Advisory Committee has their 
own student fees partially annulled 
by the committee by approximately 
$800 per quarter, effectively remov-
ing all reason for this representative 
to care about the registration fees 
that less fortunate students have to 
pay in full. 

Ben Juwono.IGu.,tdit.", 

Like the parking bribe, this is a 
simple trick on the part of adminis-
trators to encourage complacency: 
After all, if you were being paid 
$800 per quarter to sit on a com-
mittee, why would you ever do any-
thing (like speak up, make demands, 
or fight for the students) that would 
jeopardize the handsome kickback 
you have been given? This gar-
gantuan conflict of interest has 
ensured that the "Advisory" term 
in the Registration Fee Advisory 
Committee is kept under wraps at 
all times, and no transfer of power 
takes place. One wonders why the 
A.S. Council representative on this 
committee has not been publicly 
drawn and quartered by the student 
fee lobbyists, for Their difference in 
conditions is stunning. 

The above cases are only two 
examples of bribes hanging over the 
heads of 01U' student politicians, forc-
ing their complacency and ensuring 
the overall impotence of the A.S . 
Council. Further examples abound. 

To be fair, career politicians 
nationwide share these problems, 
but they are also the cause of the 
voter cynicism and mistrust of all 
student politicians at UCSD. When 
a student goverrunent orgiastically 
celebrates a mere 20-percent elec-
tion turnout, and when UCSD vot-
ers only come out to vote down 
additional fees, the message is dear: 
UCSD voters want to stop feeding 
their money into the puppet maw of 
our A.S. Council, because they know 
who is really pulling the strings. 

Let's hope that this year a cou-
ple of strings wiU be sev~red . A 
sweeping refusal on the part of 
the A.S. Council to accept parlcing 
permit perks would be a decent and 
long-overdue start.

The terror (and rain) of Admit 
Day brings back old memories 
Indecent 
Exposure 
Marianne Madden 

T his Saturday was Admit Day, the da y when all high school eniors admitted to 
UCSD are give n the run of the 
place, along with their overen-
thusiastic parents and clingy high 
school lovers. 

Every parking Spot in a three-
mile radius is filled with an SUV 
or minivan . Masses swarm on 
Library Walk: pimply, quiet kids 
who wish They were back home 
in NorCal playing Counterstrike 
and garrulous parents who get 
confused and think th(y'r( the 
ones going to college. All while 
UCSO's slickest come out as cam-
pus tour guides. Even tours of the 
res. halls are offered, so students 
can settle into a dreadful feel-
ing of claustrophobia before they 
even sign their Intent to Register. 
You can see acne, yellow UCSD 
Bookstore bags and sunscreen is 
everywhere. In short, it's terrify-
ing. 

And you can bet that as the 
uncool, overinvolved, school-spirit 
slut that I am, I wa in attendance 
this yea r, feigning interest in The 
potential froshies along with The 
best of 'em. 

Every year, when I'm roped 
into manning Admit Day festivi-
ties for one campus org or anoTh-
er, I remembe.r how far I've come 
since my daYs as a pre-frosh. The 
memory of my own Admit Day is 
hazy (I remember it involved a lot 

of rain), but making the Admit Day 
rounds every single year reminds 
me of how differem - and awe-
some - UCSD is compared to 
the damned halls of any American 
high school. Observe: 

• My high school's cafeteria 
se rves crappy, overpriced food that 
I didn' t eat. UCSD's on-campus 
eateries serve crappy, overpriced 
food that I don' t eat, but they also 
se ll coffee. Score.' 

" In high school, parties 
consist of drinking cheap 
domestic beer together on 

weekends. In coUege, 
parties consist of 

drinking cheap domestic 
beer together on 

weekends - except, if 
you Ire lucky, a couple of 

gir~ might make out." 

• In high school, class seating 
is assigned and teachers gave you 
dirty looks if you tried to sit in 
the wrong seat. In college, seat-
ing might as well be assigned, and 
some guy in an Abercrombie shirt 
gives you dirty looks if you try to 
sit in "his" seat. 

• High school quads, usually 
just a large square of pavement, 
have all the charm of prisons. 
Price Center, on the other hand, 

has all the charm of a greasy mall 
food court. 

• In high school, parties consist 
of drinking cheap domestic beer 
together on weekends. In college, 
parties consist of drinking cheap 
domestic beer together on week-
ends - except, if you're lucky, a 
couple of girls might make out. 

• High school kids make fum-
bling passes at each other during 
lunch. College kid make fum-
bling passes at each other when 
they' re so drunk they can't stand 
up. 

• High school classes are 
small, but you wish they weren't 
so it would be easier to doze off. 
College classes are so large, you 
almost wish they were smaller 
so you might actually learn the 
professor's name. 

o In high school, you're the 
envy of your friends if you have 
a fancy car, especially if it 's a 
souped-up truck or SUV. At 
UCSD, you're the envy of your 
friends if you have a "B" parking 
pass. 

o In high school, final grades 
in classes are arbitrary and cruel. 
At UCSD, final grades only seem 
arbi trary and cruel because the 
professor is much smarter than 
you. And also because you missed 
the midterm. 

• The most popular female 
accessory in high school is lip 
gloss. The most popular female 
accessory at UCSD is bleach. 

• In high school, you wouldn't 
be caught dead using a pay phone 
to call your mom for a ride home. 
At UCSD, you wouldn't be caught 
dead not using your cell phone,

Endorsements hurt 

Guardian's credibility 
Dear Editor: 

Once again April rolls around, 
and I am dismayed by the lack of 
journalistic credibility you choose 
to practice. Every .S. election , I 
open the GIUlrdioll to find the edi-

doubt your advertisers care what 
kind of sc holastic politics they 
are being paired with. On March

freedom in California universities 
["Students ' academic freedom at

Your paper is the most exposure 
any of the candidates receive. It is 
morally outrageous for you, as the 
only real campus newspaper, to set 
your own preferences on this expo-

ceitici7.ed media outlet on campus, 
SRTV, forbids its members ftom 
campaigning on air outside of orga-

are invited. N; the next generation

Letters: 
Elections 

committee 
was biased 

continued from page 5 
tha t frankly astounded me. 

During the "closed" judicial 
board hearing, which was open to all 
candidates of Onka's slate and the 
ERC student council chair to wit-
ness, Roosevelt Dynamite brought 
up a problem with the comminee's 
commitment to remain unbiased . 
The grievance filed against the slate 
was titled "Election Committee 
v. Roosevelt Dynamite" because 
the comminee itself was bringing 
charges against the people of my 
slate. It was brought up how the 
comminee acted unusuall y in serv-
ing as both judge and prosecutor in 
a case in which it was obligated to 
abstain from voting. 

-At the heari ng, the commit-
tee's only response was that one 
of its members filed the grievance 
and that the rest of the comlninee 
decided to rally around that person 
by attaching the name "election 
comminee" to the com plaint so 
as not to single that member out. 
However, the committee failed to 
answer how in doing so it didn 't 
commit itself to being biased by 
siding with the member who filed 
the charges. Needless to say, that is 
very unethical at best, and a pitiful 
excuse as to why it believed it had 
the power to preside in a case that 
should have gone directly to the 
judicial board. 

According to ERC Election 
Bylaw 407.01.03, the comminee is 
given a total span of 48 hours to act 
upon a grievance: 24 hours from 
the filing of the grievance to give 
written notification to the parties 
involved, and once that is done, 
"the ERC Election Committee 
will meet within 24 hours of noti-
fication" (407.01.03 b.). They 
chose to give our slate eight hours 
notice, utilizing one-sixth of the 
time available to them, making the 
assumption that all of us had access 
to e-mail at 2:3 0 a.m. and that all 
of us would be on campus as well 
(which I was not, due to a previous 
commitment). 

Another convenient bylaw sus-
pended for the election comminee's 
purposes was one tha t states that 
all candida tes shall have the same 
rights as expressed in the ASUCSD 
judicial bylaws (407.02 .08). One 
of those ASUCSD rights is the 
requirement that any candidate be 
given at least one academic day's 
notice in order to prepare a defense. 
Not only did the committee not pro-
vide that, but they refused to allow 
our slate the opportunity to work 
out a time where the members who 
committed "the violation" could 
attend. Our chair candidate was the 
only one who could make it to the 
hearing and was sllbje..:t to verbal 
harassment by the ERC Elections 
Committee over a matter that he 
mew nothing about and had no 
involvement in. 

The committee also directly 
disobeyed the temporary restrain-
ing order successfully filed against 
it. Another grievance was filed the 
same night of our appeal to the 
judicial board by the ERC Elections 
Committee in which, like the pre-
vious time, it was the party filing 
the charges with the full intentions 
of holding another hearing where 
it was both judge and prosecutor. 
The difference this time was that 
the committee's charge was that we 
had not complied with its demands 
to remove all campaign material, a 
punitive grievance filed with intent 
to strike back at us for getting a 
restraining order to protect our 
campaign posters. What was the 
title of this grievance? It should be 
no surprise to you that it was called 
"Election Committee v. Roosevelt 
Dynamite" as well.

Dynamite: Committe~s' 
power must be checked Still looking for a career? 
continued from page 6 

Associated Students requires that 
its elections comminee give all par-
ties involved due process, and it is 
my feeling that ERC should as well . 
[ do not believe that the unanimous 
judicial board ruling at all repre-
sented a condemning case against 
my slate, especially when the judicial 
board did not hear about all of the 
ERC Elections Committee's viola-
tions of bylaws during the hearing; 
several specific reference bylaws that 
had been broken were discovered by 
my slate after the hearing was over. 
I do find it amazing that such a com-
minee could justify irs actions, and 
I fi nd it odd that the judicial board 

decision contained no explanation at 
all , but just a reference to the ERC 
election bylaw on spend ing-limit 
violations . 

I hope this letter clarifies what 
really went on at ERe. [ could say 
more, but I have academic work to 
catch up on that has been put to 
the side this paSt week due to my 
battling for candidacy. This whole 
ordeal definitely proved to me that 
ERC is in need of more administra -
tive checks on the power of students 
appointed to regulate the elections.

"The school know; what 'we're aboul, and 
we tea ch and share about our life. " 

LaPlallle was pan of a 25-111elllber 
team that taught English to chi ldren and 
adults in the Czech Republic in 199H. 

" I establi shed my career after college, 
then went overseas," LaPlante said. " It 's 
a good opportunity to live in another 
coun try, and it's nice to know you're not 
going alone."

During her stay, there were nin e "m-
dents on her four-month trip, which al,o 
included visits to the Tiputini Biodi, er,ity

Andes. ccording to LoFt, the pr<>!{nllll 
was a great way to become immef',cd in 
the society, and it served as a .. elf-chang-

" It's important for us to realize that 
service-learning isn 't about going to 
change the world, it's about going to be 
changed by the world ," Loft said. " Ideally, 
we come away from it having experi nced 
meaningful interaction with people from

MONDAY, APRIL II, 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN PORTS 15 

.Volleyball: Poor attacking 
percentage costs UCSD match 

Baseball: Tritons plagued 
by hot heat and cool cold 

Tennis: 
Success is the 
standard for 

women's team 
coruin~d from page 16 

an incredible .500 attack percenuge 
by the Cougars and a -.033 attack 
percenuge from the Tritons. 

Once again, the Tritons had a 
slim lead to start game two but 
couldn't hold off a surging BYU 
squad. UCSD led, 10-8 and 11-
10, before a 5-1 BYU run turned 
the tables and gave the Cougars 
the lead. With a 12- 15 lead, the 
Cougars never looked back and 
the Tritons never came closer than 
three points. BYU led 19-26 at one 
point before finishing game two at 
25-30 to take a two-game lead. 

Game three was all BYU as 
the Cougars took a 6-7 lead that 
turned into a 21-29 lead later in 
the game. The match was all bur 
finished when UCSD managed a 
5-0 run to put BYU under pressure. 
However, the Cougars were not 
fared and won the game, 26-30, and 
the match, 3-0. 

The Cougars' Vicror Bautista 
had a spectacular game. with nine 
kills, a .667 attack percentage, two 
aces and three blocks. Sophomore 
middle blocker Garret Smith led 
UCSD with eight kills. 

BYU dominated the TritOns su-
tistically as well, outhitting them 
.352 to .060. The Cougars also 
dominated the Tritons in blocks, 
notching 12 blocks compared to 
UCSD'ssix. 

The straight-set loss to BYU 
was like deja vu all over again for 
the Tritons, who lost their previous 
meeting on April 8. BYU was just as 
dominant in this match, beating the 
Tritons, 19-30,24-30,24-30. 

The Cougars POWlCed on the 
Tritons early in game one, scoring 
10 of the first 11 points to tllc.e a 1-
10 lead. The Tritons got it as close 
as 7-15, but three straight attaclc. 
errors late in the game gave it to 
BYU,19-30. 

The Tritons managed to hold 
a lead in game two, leading as late 
as 12- 11 before a 5-2 run put 8YU 
back on top, 14-16. That lead 
expanded to 20-25 before a 3-1 
Triton run made it 23-26. That was 
as close as it got before BYU went 
on a 4-1 run to close out game two, 
24-30. 

In game three. the Tritons suyed 
close, only trailing 8-9 before a 10-5 
Cougar run made it 13-19. Soon 
enough, that lead was 20-28 and 
the Tritons were on the brink of 
elimination. A 4-0 run gave the 
TritOns false hopes before BYU 
closed out the game, 24-30, and the 
match,3-0. 

Once again, the Tritons' subpar 
.116 arrack percentage could not 
match up to the Cougars' .3 75 sUt 
The Cougars also managed to tally 
II blocks, compared to 4.5 from 
the Tritons. 

Individually, freshman outside 
hitter Russ Hardy led the Tritons 
with nine kills, but was overshad-
owed by another outsunding per-
fomlance by BYU's Baurisu, who 
had 12 kills. 

Following the 0-2 road nip to 
Utah, the Tritons will end the sea-
son at RIMAC Arena with two 
matches ag1linst UC Irvine and 
UCLA on April 13 and April 15, 
respectively. 

continued from page 16 
Triton win. 

The outcome of the nightcap 
proved to be a different story for 
UCSD. While the Tritons scored 
first on a sacrifice fly in the sec-
ond inning, the Wildcats came on 
strong in their half of the second, 
batting around and scoring five 
runs on five hits and two UCSD 
errors. 

Chico State posted four 
more runs in the bottom of the 
fourth, putting the team ahead, 
9- 1. UCSD scored two in the 
sixth as Morehead si ngled, and 
Hernandez and Lawson hit back-
to-back doubles, making it a 9-3 
game. 

But the Wildcat lead would 
prove to be too much to over-
come for the Trirons. Chico ute 
recorded three additional runs 
before the game ended. UCSD 
junior hurler T.c. Geach (2 - I) 
picked up the loss, while Tim 
Thompson (5-1) earned the win 

for the Wildcats. 
The second doubleheader 

between the two CCAA powers 
was in progress at press time. 

Earlier in the week, the 
Tritons pounded out 23 hits en 
route to a 20-1 1 victory over 
Cal State Dominguez Hills 
(17-20 overall, 7-16 CCAA) 
on April 6 at Triton Baseball 
Stadium. Morehead, last week's 
CCAA Player of the Week, 
led all players with four hits, 
including a two-run home fUll . 
Morehead joined Pinocchio, 
Clark and senior first baseman 
Brian Robinson with three RBIs 
apiece. Senior third baseman 
Alex Gascon led UCSD with 
four RBIs. 

UCSD is back in action at 
Triton Baseball Stadium April 15 
and April 16, hosting Cal Poly 
Pomona · (2 1-13 overall, 17-7 
CCAA) in a three-game series. 
The first pitch on April 15 is 
slated for 3 p.m. 

continued from page 16 
one spot. The Tritons' last two 
matches of the season will be on 
the road and are makeup CCM 
matches rained out earlier th is 
season. The team visits Cal State 
San Bernardino April 11 and Cal 
State Bakersfield on April 16. 
A victory in either match will 
clinch the Tritons' second con-
secutive CCAA title. The Tritons 
won both of their matches against 
these teams handily ea rli er this 
season, 8-1 against Cal State San 
Bernard ino and 9-0 again t Cal 
State Bakersfi eld . 

"We're doing absolutely great 
this season," Malinow sa id. "I 
look around and see everybody 
focused out there. Even i r they're 
down, they're able to come back. 
Everybody's motivated and has a 
lot of desire. ] think there's a good 
chance we can go to Nationals. I'm 
real I y exci ted. " 

Following the conclusion of the 
regular season, the team will prc-
pare for the Regional competition, 
May 6 to May 8, with the loca-
tion yet to be determined. Should 
the Tritons finish the season unde-
feated in CCAA play, chances arc 
good that they will host one of the 
twO sites for Regional competition. 
The other site will likely be at BYU 
Hawaii, home of the top Division 
II team in the country.

not playing when we don't need 
them," head coach Liz LaPlante aid. 
"We are going to get some rest, and 
hopefully come back fresh."

No. 1.7 baseball splits 
with No.5 Chico State 
Tritons capitalize on Wildcats' 

eight errors, drop nightcap 
By COURTNEY FIELD 

Senior Staff Writer 
T he 17th-ranked UCSD base-

ball team split its doubleheader 
with No.5 Chico State on April 
9 in Chico, Calif. The Tritons 
took the opener in a battle of 
each squad's top pitchers: UCSD 
senior hurler Logan Boutilier (S-
I) picked up the 5-3 victory while 
Wildcat starter Kris Krise (S-I) 
was handed his first loss of the sea-
son. Triton senior closer SWomo 
Lipetz was superb in relief, pitch-
ing 2.2 shutout innings with two 
hits allowed and three strikeouts, 
to earn his fifth save of the sea-
son. Chico State then took advan-
tage of four UCSD errors in the 
nightcap and downed the Tritons, 
12-3. 

In game one against Chico State 
(24-7- 1 overall , 17-6 California 
Collegiate Athletic Association), the 
Tritons (2 1-1 1 overall, 15-8 CCAA) 
capitalized on eight Wildcat errors 
to earn the victory, 5-3. With UCSD . 
leading, 2-1, through five innings, 
the Tritons punched through in the 
sixth inning, posting three runs on 
two hits and an error. 

UCS D sophomore catcher 
David Morehead singled to lead off 
the inning for the Tritons. Senior 
shortstop Keith Hernandez bunt-
ed, trying to advance the runner. 
As Hernandez reached first base, 
Wildcat pitcher Krise threw the 
ball past the first baseman, allow-
ing Morehead to advance to :bird 
and Hernandez to second with 

no outs. Junior outfielder Matt 
Lawson then lined a single to left, 
scoring both runners for the 4- 1 
lead. Lawson stole second, and 
with one out, junior rightfielder 
David Gomez walked and senior 
leftfielder Craig King was hit by a 
pitch to load the bases and knock 
Chico State starter Krise out of 
the game. Senior second baseman 
Ricky Pinocchio struck out for 
the second out of the inning, but 
senior designated hitter Joel Clark 
drew a walk to score UCSD's 
third run of the inning and put 
the Tritons ahead, 5- \. 

Chico State chipped away at 
the UCSD advantage with anoth-
er run in the bottom of the sixth, 
but the inning could have been 
much worse for the Tritons. With 
two outs and the bases full of 
Wildcats, Chico State first base-
man Ryan Martin singled to 
left field and drove in one run. 
After King fired home to catcher 
Morehead, however, Morehead 
threw back behind the runner at 
second base, allowing Pinocchio 
to apply the tag for the final out 
of the inning with UCSD in front, 
5-2 . Lipetz came on to record the 
final outs in the seventh as Chico 
State scored one more run to nar-
row the lead to 5-3, UCSD. 

In the Chico State half of the 
ninth, the Wildcats put runners 
on first and second with one out. 
Lipetz then produced a game-end-
ing double play to preserve the

under clear skies as the Triton 
doubles teams bounded out to an 
early 2-1 lead before going into 
the singles lineup. 

Senior Bryan Swatt and fresh-
man Will Phan gave the Tritons 
(11-5 overall) their first victory 
of the match by defeating Joe 
Cartledge and Jeremy Owens at 
No. 2 doubles, while freshman 
Blake Meister and junior Erik 
Oijala added an S-5 victory at o. 
3 double . Triton junior Brent 
Molden and sophomore Seth 
Spector conceded their match to 
Mark Contreras and Christian 
Frick in the Highlanders' No. I 
doubles team 's first victory of the 
season, 4-S. 

At No. 1 singles, Swatt had 
little trouble defeating Justin 
Montgomery in the first set, 6-1, 
and was able to sustain a come-
back to close out the match, 7-6. 
Spector handed Cartledge a loss at 
No.3 singles, easily outmaneuver-
ing his opponent, 6-3, 6-1. 

Tied at 3-3, the entire match 
boiled down to Meister playing 
Owens for the victory at No. 5 
singles. Meister easily picked up 
a first-set win, defeating Owens 
6-1, but Owens came back to win 
the second set, 2-6, forcing a deci-
sive third set. In a seesaw battle, 
Meister came out on top with a 7-5 
victory, giving the Tritons the win. 

At No. 2 singles, Molden 
dropped a match to Contteras, 
2-6, 2-6, while Oijala was unable 

to pull a match from Frick at 
No. 4 singles. No. 6 singles saw 
UC Riverside's Jordan Lee defeat-
ing Phan, 1-6, 2-6, giving UC 
Riverside its four wins. 

The victory extends the 
Tritons' record to 10-5 with 
only four matches left in the 
season, including a highly antici-
pated pril 14 through April 16 
trip north to play UC Davis, 
Sonoma State and Santa Clara. 
T he trip will kick off with a 
tough match aga inst the Division 
1 Aggies, who have always given 
the Tritons a good match, and 
will end in the Bay Area against 
Santa Clara. The season closer 
will be played at the Northview 
Tennis Courts against Cal Poly 
Pomona on April 19. 

The men are in line to make 
the playoffs at the end of April 
to try their hand at reaching the 
NCAA Division IT Regionals. 

But the Tritons will have to 
maintain their focus through the 
end of their season. 

"I think to do well in the play-
offs, our team needs to focus on 
one thing to improve in the four 
weeks before they begin," head 
coach Eric Steidlmayer said. "If 
we can accomplish that while still 
doing everything else needed, then 
we will be in good shape. The 
team has realized that it is good, 
that it can be better, and that it 
can be tougher, both physically 
and mentally."

After a winless, two-game road 

nip to Provo, Utah, against No. 
7 Brigham Young University, the 
UCSD men's volleyball team is 
preparing for its final home stand 
of the 2004-05 season with games 
again t uc Irvine and UCLA later 
this week. 

The nip to Utah was a disap-
pointing one, as the Tritons (2-22 
overall, 1-19 Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation) dropped both games to 
BYU in straight sets. The April 9 
game, which the Tritons lost, IS-30, 
25-30, 26-30, was Senior Night at 
BYU, and the Cougar seniors did 
their job. 

BYU (IS-9 overall, 13-7 MPSF) 
did not start dominating until midway 
through the first game. The Tritons 
started with an early lead before a 
four-point run put the Cougars up, 
9-11. The Tritons nied to keep the 
Cougars at bay and stayed as close 
as 12- 15 until BYU scored 15 of the 
last 21 points to win the game, IS-30. 
The easy win was made possible by

UCSD stays undefeated in CCAA 
Women's tennis tops Hawaii-Hila, CSULA 

By EVAN WANG 
Senior Staff Writer 

With two matches left to play 
in the regular season, the UCSD 
women's tennis team continues to 
build confidence and momentum, 
brushing aside another opponent 
for its third straight victory and 
improving to 15-3 overall. 

On April 9, the team hosted its 
last regular season home match, 
against 33rd-ranked Cal State Los 
Angeles. The last time the two 
teams met, the Tritons dominat-
ed, taking an S-I decision in Los 
Angeles, and this time they were 
even more dominant, sweeping the 
Golden Eagles 9-0. In the dou-
bles lineup, sophomores Marsha 
Malinow and Kristin Bronowicki 
represented UCSD at the No. 1 
spot, and utterly demolished their 
opponents, Cal State Los Angeles' 
Rona Miller and Dana Popescu, 
in an 8-0 sweep that set the tone 
for the entire match. Senior Jasmin 
Dao and junior Marissa Hilker, 
moving up from their usual No. 3 
spot to play at No. 2, pulled out 
an S-6 victory over the Golden 
Eagles' Kimmy Barnes and Maggie 
Bollinger, and junior Leigh Roberts 
and sophomore Liz Brown took an 
S-2 decision at the No. 3 spot over 
the Cal State Los Angeles team of 
sisters Charise and Kim Godoy, 
completing the doubles sweep. 

"We've had to play a lot of 
matches all at once recently, and 
that's resulted in some injury 
problems," Malinow said. "We've 
lost two key players, but hope-
fully they'll be back within the 
next week or so. We had to make 
some changes in doubles, but they 
turned out quite well - we got 
positive results." 

Sophomore Katie McKee and 
junior Tara Siddiqui could not 
compete in the match because of 
injuries. 

On the singles side, it was 
straight-set victories all around. 
Malinow defeated the elder 
Godoy sister, Charise, 7-5, 6-1, 
at the top of the ladder. Hilker 
defeated Popescu, 6-2, 7-5, at No. 
2 and Roberts beat Bollinger 7-5, 
6-2, at No.3. Bronowicki took 
down Miller at the No. 4 spot, 
6-1, 7-5, and Brown triumphed 

over Barnes, 6-4, 6-1, at No.5. 
Freshman Justine Fonte came up 
with the easiest singles victory of 
the day for the Tritons, defeating 
Kim Godoy 6-0, 6-1, to pick up 
her second collegiate victory. 

The team, now a flawless S-O 
in California Collegiate Athletic 
Association play, is ranked No. 
11 in the Intercollegiate Tennis 
Association's latest rankings 
(released April 6), dropping
