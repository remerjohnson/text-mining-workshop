One-Newspaper Town 
Anyone who aw the SAN

wonder why thi s is a one-
newspaper town . 

Fully on -third of the 
front pag was occupiE'd by 
james opl y's recent in-
terview with Pr ident Nix-
on. But it was not an inter-
vi w, and it contained no 
news. It wa a thinly dis-

the Copley papers' failure 
as metropolitan 
newspapers. 

Anoth r article on the

President's projE'cted veto

Copley 's (James ' fost e r

competition . a ys a 
biographer, " His realistic 
view was to ' buy them or 

ell them, ' meaning to bu y 
out the competitor or ell 
out to him." HIS rationale 
for destroying competition 
wa s that it cau sed un -

Grow Your Own 
in California 

an Francisco, Ca. (Ars) - California is shortly to become 
the first state to vote on marijuana. 

During the ov. 7 election, the state's voter wrll be asked 
to decide on a proposal to remove criminal pena lties for 
anyone 18 or old r for " planllng, cu lt ivating, harvesting, 
drying, processing, otherwise preparing, transporting, or 
pmse sing marijuana for personal use." The measure also 
prohibits "persons undN the influence of marijuana from 
engaging in conduct that endangers others." Selling would 
remain rilegal. 

That's II. Othf'fwi~e, you'll be able to grow your own in 
California. 

If it passes. An early-September poll howed o n ly 33 per 
(l'n t support for thr California Milrijuana In itiative (CMI).

All of this lVas done with very little money. Of the estimated

Michael Aldrich, Amorphla's co-di rector and edi tor of The 
Marijuana Rrview, beli ves what is happening now in alifor-

" TlVenty states now have the initiative as a means for 
changing the law," he says. "Ma riju ana cou ld be on the ballot 
in t n or 12 of them in the next f w years. And the issue has 
Wider appe,ll than most people think." 

CMl's Brownell echoes Aldrich's thoughts. " Even If we 
don't win, it will st ill be a victory. We took a 50-ca lled ' freak 
ISsue', (smoking pot ), and legitimized it. We put it before the 
public and won endorsem nts. If we don ' t make it this year, it 
will be an issue aga in III 7 4. It will come of age eventually."

Revelle Coffee House 
Apathy 

One of t he brightest ideas in years to improve the at-
mosphere at Revelle is in the process of being strangled . The 
Revelle Coffee House is being killed by Apathy. 

The larg st criticism of Revelle seems to be its lack of a 
social lounge or a student center. For a while the Coffee Hut 
near the Provost's office served this purpose. But this year the 
Coffee Hut began to close ea rly in the evenings. Students had 
nowhere 10 go to get a cup of coffee and rap . 

To fill thi s need the Coffee House was opened in th(' 
Revelle South Dining Hall. Here was a place where students 
ould get some coffee or cider and a snack. No longer would 

th y have to depend upon the dreaded " machines" for 
sustenence. 

AI first the Coffee Hous was staffed by Resident Assistant\ 
in the dorms. Then a Coffe House Committee was formed to 
o rganize student volunteers to work there. The response was 
good for the first few w eks. But after a while volunteers 
stopped signing up. The committee was forced to spend more 
and more time behind th£' coun ter collecting nickels. 

Last \V ek the situation became untenable. igns were put 
up saying that the Hous wouldn't ope n that night unle\s 
somebody volunt('rred to work . The House was also forced to 
close early occaSiona ll y until one of those present offer d to 
sit behind the counter. 

Actuallv it is amMlng, to some, tha t apathy could ev€'n 
strlk(' a place like the Coffee House. Most nigh ts around 200 
peopl(' come by the House It is not su rprising why. 

Wh('fp pl~p can you gN fresh donuts at a nickel-a-piere l 
£\rn donut shops usually charge more lik a dime. Wher 
('Is£' {'.In you g('t (ld('r for a nickel a cup? At only five (I'nts a 
cup the House 1051'\ a liTtle on ea{'h cup that they sell. Wh€'r(, 
!'lSI' ran vou g<'l coff('e for a nickel? Though thIS It('m hrlps 
th£'ITI to hreak even, the machines 30 feet away charge Ih,,'(' 
liml" that amount. 

Where I'lsC' (an you go to talk at R('velle in the evenlngsl 
1 h(' Housp is opC'n from 8:30 until 11 :30 on weekday~ and 
from 8'30 until1 011 we k('nd~. They also have piped in music 
dnd sOIllPtime., live folk gUitarists. 

Two of thp 1,ISt committ r memb rs, Linda King and tevr 
BJrklC'y hdvP stated, " If we don't get more vo lun teers soon 
w£' will ha~e to c10~ it down." 

It IS ironical that II would take so v ry !rltle to keep thl' 
Coffpr Hou~e open If il few students just volunteered to 
""olk one .. hift, 3 hours, oncp-il-month then thp House would 
b£' In good shape. Even if a student didn't want to h Ip behind 
the counter there is a lot of work to be done cis where. Th(' 

HOll~e npl'ds mana!:!'fS to take care of money and be In 
charge, and it needs peopl to help with publi<lty and 
C'nlNtd Inmrnt 

ome reople already STav ill the House all night, reading, 
~tudying or just talkrng. 

Working condillons- surely ar n't hard. All a volunteer 
""ould have to do is tdke nickels and occasionally makE' 
change. The food and drink come already prepared courtrsy 
01 Larry Barrett, Food and Hou Ing Manager. But som on(' 
must b there in order for the doors to open. Th Hou~ can't 
{'xist unlE'ss st udents are willing to sign up in advance on thp 
sign-up sheet in the Hous . 

WhethPr apathy has killed the Coffee House or not will b€' 
~e€'n tonight. Every Tuesday at 9 p.m. there is a Coffee House 
Commi ttee meeting in the Hous ,but tonight'S meeting will 
be special. The committee has said that unless conditions 
change very loon then it is allover. The Coffee House at 
Revelle will close and apathy will have claimed another 
victim.

A WEEI< 
, 

Saturday Oct. 28, marked 
the breaking of the world en-
durance record for a foot 
launch glider at the Torrey 
Pines cliffs. The record was 
shattered by Taras Kiceniuk Jr., 
a freshman at Cal Tech., who 
kept his glider adrift for two 
hours twenty-five minutes. 

This is the second time 
within the last few months that 
Taras has captured the world 
record. H~ set his first world 
record last spring: seventy-
one minutes twenty-eight 
seconds. At that time he 
landed at a speed of 1000 
it/sec but he managed to 
maintain control of his glider. 
This record was then broken 
by another glider who glided 
for two hours and twenty 
minutes, and then landed on 
the Angeles Forest Highway 
and Antelope Freeway. 

The glider, built by Taras 
who wishes to become an 
aeronautical engineer, was 
called the Icarus II. The glider 
weighs 55 pounds and has a 29 
foot wing span. Taras, who 
weighs 145 wore a British air 
force jacket, clear goggles, a 
helmet made out of cloth, and 
woven pants tucked into his 
shoes. Despite his warm dress 
Taras said "it was sure cold up 
there." 

Taras launched his glider by 

• Hannal;l Cohen jumping off one of the cliffs. 
Though most gliders are 
launched by some vehicle 
such as a boat Taras prefers the 
foot launch. 

According to Lewis 
Hashimoto, also a freshman at 
Cal Tech, the launch is the 
most dangerous event of 
gliding. He said "most ac-
cidents occur during the 
launch because getting off the 
ground and staying off is a 
hard trick." 

Gliding, though more pop-
ular in recent years, is no new 
sport to Southern California. 
Southern California and es-
pecially San Diego have been 
the world center for gliding. 
This is because the air in San 
Diego and vicinity is stable. 
The first glider was flown in 
San Diego at Otay, Mesa in the 
1880's by J.J. Montgomery. 
August 1972 marked the se-
cond annual Montgomery 
Gliding Competition here. 

Most gliders are built by the 
fliers themselves. Plans are 
sold by those whose glider 
designs have been successful. 
Taras is now selling his for $5 a 
copy. One of the most impor-
tant facts other than wing span 
in designing a glider is drag. 
According to Lewis, weight or 
age of the pilot of a glider is 
not too important.

Tea Party Encore 
Washington, D.C. - If you think the 

nation's 200th anniversary is going to slip 
by you unnoticed, listen : 

• a plan to commemorate the Boston 
Tea Party is in the offing from-who 
else?-Lipton Tea; 

• Hallmark Greeting Cards will market 
a line with a revoluntionary motif; 

• the travel industry in the U.S. will be 
spending an estimated extra $2S million 
to get you into the bicentennial swing of 
things; 

• Baskin-Robbins already is promoting 
Its revoluntionary flavors, and Sara Lee 
has checked in with a bid to bake the 
nation'S officia l 200th birthday cake; 

• plans ar€' underway to tie in the Miss 
America Pageant, th Orange Bowl 
Parade, MacDonald's burgers and, ap-
propriate ly, the Ringling Brothers' circus 
wi th the government-planned bicenten -
nial of the American Revolut ion; 

The People's Bicentennial Commission 
h working with labor groups, the 

merican Historical Society and even the 
Park Service In putting together 
programs The Philad Iphia office is 
\~orking on a detailed tax "reform" 
proposal to re~hdpe inheritance and cor-
porate ta~('s; it's called Tax Equity for 

mericam (TEA) Part y. Also, an Indian 
group is being formed independently of 
PBC va rious women's coal itions are 
working on plans, and in Washington an 
"fro-Am rican Bicentennial Corporation 
I" underway. 

PBC is diff rent from most. U.S. radical 
~roups in that it is a cont inuous project, 
nOI just a one-shot affair like a D.C. 
dpmo. And PBC head Jeremy Rifkin is 
nOI you r normal run-of-the-s logan 
organizer . Even orthodox groups are 
ronsidering aligning with the People's 
Commission inst ad of the government 
aitNnative: the relatively independent 
mithsonian Institution, colleges and un-

Iver ities, and Leagues of Women Voters 
have to make a choice, and the blatant 
comme rcia lism of ARBC often repels 
even the most innocuous groups. 

When Rifkin and th PBC got hold of 
reams and reams of xeroxed material 
from the ARBC files and released them 
10 the press, this commercialism was 
documented even beyond what most 
people imagined. It wasn 't just that 
politics a nd top management 
bU'lnessmen had sim ply interfered with 
"-RBe work; th('y were running it entire-
Iv The Information was the biggest 
"leak" of classified documents since the 
P('ntagon Papers, but so far there 's been 
no attempt to bring PBC to court for 
receiving "s tol en documents" or 

1 wndlever the current euphemism is. 
"They wouldn't dare prosecute," says 

Rifkin . "That would mean they'd be 
pressing charges against us for exposing 
their secrf' t plans to celebrate freedom. 

It's a Catch-22 id ea all around. There 
would be an absolutely Buchwaldian 
courtroom scene." He relishes the idea. 

Rifkin is fond of referring to the ARBC 
and allied corporate interests as Tor ies, 
and with good cause. They hold the same 
mon ied positions of influence as the 
Royalists did 200 yea rs ago, with a vested 
Interest in keeping things the way they 
arf'. Whatever the difference in siTe and 
stature, it's clear the PBC annual budget 
(ould fit in the ARBC petty cash box. 
(ARBC is having some difficulty getting 
its appropriations this year-Rifkin's dis-
closures were too much even for some 

members of Congress to handle-but 
they're opera ting on contingency funds 
until Congress gives In .) By the time the 
whole hoopla IS compll'tf'd, PBC es-
timates that the federal government will 
spend over five billion dollars for the 
bicentonnialization of America. 

Quite clearly, ARBC s goal IS to win 
over thf' hearts and minds of Amc>ricans 
uSing thf' rus,. of thf' hlCenlf'nnial 
hogwash to r('wrlt(' history-and It gets 
nminous Plam are underway to makc' 
'ure f'\ery Boy Sumt land prpsumablv 
(>VNY Girl (oull wears d government 
hlc('ntennial shoulder patch. ~port~ 
rallies arp planned In large stadiums, With 
th(' government's bicentennial program 
as th(' theme. (This, Rifkin points out, IS 

clos('r to the Hitler Youth Movement In 
Gprmany than the revolution In 
America.) The Pentagon will have a 
public awareness campaign on how the 
United States military serves freedom. 
Nixon's imprint and philosophy will not 
just carryover to the 1976 whoopldy-
doo, but way beyond. 

As part of the program, a California 
group wants to send around a roving 
display of American patriotism, traveling 
from one suburban shopping center to 
another. It will include a time capsule 
(use you r imagination for items in-
cluded). a lSO-second film on the hl~iory' 
of the United tates, and a giant scroll to 
col lect signatures of an estimat('d 7 

million Americans pledging their 
allegiance to the U.S. flag. One envl,ions 
a gargantuan role of toilet paper with the 
pledge of allegiance emblazoned at the 
top, and suddenly the government's 
Am e ri ra n Re volution Bicentennial 
program comes into focus. 

Need there be any more reason than 
that for an alternative? 

Peace at Hand? 
It is very easy to believe that peace is near. The 

combi ned pressu res of ixon's imminent rE'election, 
th (' thr('at of continued bombings that might make 
reconstruction impossible, and the Russians and 
Chinese, the North's allies, both moving independently 
closer to the nit d States, appear to have induced 

orth Vietnam to negotiate. 
While It seems true a sett lement IS near, ann both the 

United State~ and orth Vielnam havp madp certain 
concessions, ju~t what has hppn s('tlled IS uncl('ar It i~ 
certainly not a negotiated peace 

Several agrpements make peace f'xtremely doubtful 
First, the ceose-firf' allows orth Vi('tnampse to stay in 
thpir positions m the South, a major U.s. conc('ssion 
The agrpem('nt provide~ for a "onf'-for-onp" 
replacement of exist Ing mllilary eqUipment In South 
Vietnam. 

Unilpd Statps prisoners will be rpl('as('d from the 
orth during the 60 day cease-fire, but the thousands of 

prison('rs held by the South will remain interned. 
Finally, the aweement may not be signpd by elthpr 

thp dlgon or the Viet Cong governments, the parties 
who arp supposed to neg0tiate rlirpctly to mold a 
tripartite interim government to sel up elections. 
Instpan, Paris sources r(>cently indicated that SE'crc ary 
of State William RodgNs dnd North Viptnamf'~p Foreign 
Mlnisler Nguyen Duy Trinh would sign. 

Whilp thf'\(' prOVISIOns relieve the United State, of 
most of it~ rpsponsihilltl('s, thpy al,o Ipavf' th(' v.av open 
for thl' VtCIOUS political and military baltl(' between 
'\orth Jnd South to rp\ume. A~ parl\ .l~ 00. 11, 
Prp)lnent Thl{'u W.I' quoted as ,avlng "Coallt;on mpans

Said thl' W" HI GTO"J POST, "He app('ared to 1')(' 
Id\in~ th(' groundwork to r('p(,rlt, it npcpssJrY, his open 
confrontation with th(' lmlled Statps in 1968 ovpr pf'arp

i,on took office." ' 
Agreements arc based on both sides r('speCllng them. 
othmg seem\ to Indicate that if thl' North violated the 

agrpements, that the Lniled tates would be willing to 
re('nter thl' conflict. Lillie seems to stand in the way of 
the Vietnam conflict becoming again what If was In 
1954: a CI\,il war 

If this is true, then one wonders why the war had to 
continue these pa~t four years. In thiS light, any terms 
seem meaningless. The orth Vietnamese proposal put 
forth Oct. 8 precipitated the negotiations. In It, \.;nIIed 
States demands were agreed to that military and 
political solutions be dealt with separately 

The military solution begins with a cease-fire which 
has been unclearly defined to extend to all of In-
dochina. Th(> Unitf'd Statl's is to withdrav. ItS forces in 60

Open Letter to Chancellor McElroy 
from The Radical Coalition 

We are asking you not to alll)w the 
arm('d services recrui ters to come onto 
the UCSD campus. The argum£'nt in 
favor of allowing th se individuals on 
C,lmplJS has alwdys bpen the old liberal 
one. everyone must be permitted to 
speak his own mind in a "free" atmos-
phere. In face of the Vietnam war alone 
this argument should seem absurd: 
Those in power speak their minds and 
make the decisions which everyone el~e 
is forced to l isten to and obey. AND AS 
LONG AS THEIRE I A POWER ELITE 
THIS WILL BE TRUE. And there is a power 
elite con tro ll ing t he University of 
Californ ia. let's just take a look at Ihe Re-
gents. Accordi ng to this year's UCSD 
catalog, the Regen ts have comp lete con-
Irol over the University. 

"The o rganization and government of 
the University is entrusted under the 
State Constitu tion to the Regents of 
the University of California .... He 
(the President) and his staff direct the 
development of major policy for the 
Imtitution. The Boa rd of Regent; ap-
points the President and he is dirl'ctl y 
responsible to them. On each cdmpus 
the ch ief administrative officer is the 
Chancellor:,also appointed by the Re-
gents .... 

Here's a brief run-down on some of 
the Regents . 

W. Glen Campbell - was r search 
economist for thE' U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce (Eisenhower years). former re-
search director for the American Fnter-
prise Institute for Public Policy. 

John Canaday - public relations 
counsel for lock head. 

Edward W . Carter - Dir(' ctor, 
American Telegraph and Telephone Co. 
Director, Del Monte Corporation, 
Director, United California Bank, 
Director, Pacific Mutual life Insurance, 
Director, Southern California Edison, 
Director, Western Bancorporation , 

William Coblentz - Consultant to 
Secretary of State Dean Rusk in 1962, one 
of six businessmen in the United State, 
who is a member of Nixon's National 
Commission on Productivity. 

Fred e ri ck Dutton - Kenned y's 
Secretary of the Cabinet, 1961 . 

Catherine Hearst - wife of William 
Randolph Hearst, president of the Hearst 
Publishing Company (a notorious anti-
labor company which employed Violent 
sca b labor during the lengthy los 
Angeles Herald-Examiner strike ~everal 
years ago). 

William Routh - Director and Chair-
man, Pa ific National life Assurance Co. 
Director, Crocker-Citizen Bank 

William F. Smith - 'Member, Board of 
Directors, Pacific Telephone and Tele-/ 
graph 
Director, Pacific Mutual life Insurance 
Director, Crocker Citizens National Bank 

Dean Watk ins - 10-YPd[ romultant to 
thc' Department of Denfeme. 

We cou ld go on, but you probably get 
the POlnl The same mC'n who run the 
govprnment, thf \tock mOlrhC'l , big 
bUSiness run the UniverSity of Callfornid. 
Naturally they hav£' a tertaln vest d 

interE'~t in retaining most of thp fpatures 
of present-day American soci!'t}, 
naturally they are by their very natur!' 
consNvativE' . Th y would have the most 
to los(' if this country experienced any 
fundJmental changp. particularly one of 
d socialist nature. 

It 's time to get rid of the idea that the 
University is Simply an open forum for 
men of all political persuasiom and from 
all "walks of life." Thf" University of 

alifornia is controlled by the Regents 
and by the Fedrral Governm(:'nt which 
bestows upon it desperately needed re-
search grants. UCSD ranks as the tenth 
univ rsi ty in the nation to receive federal 
non-medical research and development 
mr)f1f'Y, las year $10.5 million 0 the total 
$32 million ca me from th Department 
of l1efense. The Univl'rsity docs engage 
in war research. The Naval Electronics 
laboratory (which IS connected directly 
with UC D despite the administration's 
protestations to the contrary) works 
dirf"ctly ondevices which have been used 
in the war. ThE'se inculdt' image re-
~toration techniques (using a computer 
to clear up a blurred or fUllY pk.ture 
takpn, ay, from great aerial distances) 
and sound deVi ces, dropped In Vietnam 
along the Ho Chi Minh trail , which can 
detect almos! any movement. This is to 
say nothing of the two atomic energy 
centers of the University of California, 
Livermore and the Lawrence Radiation 
Laboratory. All the work done here is 
literally owned by the Atomic Energy 
Commission and this commission de-

ides which projects are made known to 
the public and which ar nnnnnnnot 

So it seems about time to put away the 
sorry tale about how the University is no t 
a political institution . It also seems about 
time for the University and you, Dr. 
McElroy, to begin to exercise the correct 
politics. Find out about war r('search at 
U SD and its adjuncts, publish for the 
public's perusal the terms of all Defen e 
Department contracts, and don't allow 
the military to come on thiS campus 
p ddling theIr wares. CompliCity with 
the military is horrifying enough but 
when it\ on this mo;t bliltant level it's 
<trnply intolerable. Exercise the right 
politics for once. This would be a sub-
stantial step in the right direction, a 
change whi<.h cou ld eventually 
culminale in a society where these is no 
power elite, a world in which the old 
lib ral notion of everyone being per-
mitted to speak his own mind would 
really make some sense. How about it, 
Chancellor McElroy?

A RESPO 'lE TO JfrF 
WFIMTFI 'S LEnIR I 
THE TRITON TIMES 

I rw('d not respond to 
jeff's concern lhat an ap-
prentice tl'achpr bf rl'-
congnlzed as a real tNcher 
because it is not a pOtnt on 
which his students h<lve any 
doubt. His conc rn about 
t h I~ p~C'udo-rroblpm In-
dicates' however, that hiS 
attack on the Humanities 
sequence rell cIs hiS per-
so nal hang-ups, and it 
demonstrates that he does 
not understand the nature 
of his task as a teacher in 
the humanilies. 

We are - to paraphrase 
Jeff - prf'senting a selec-
tion of great books in thE' 
Humanaties Sl'quenn', and 
we are trying to under-
stand and enJoy them. The 
tone of jeff's letter makes 
m think, how('ver. that he 
and I disagree on the 
nature of enjoyment. We 
want students to enJoy the 
books but not in the way 
they enjoy television or the 
movies. What we seek 
derives from intellectual in-
volvement with complex 
ideas and brilliant 
literature. These works are 
occasionally entertaining. 
but the real rewards come 
from a defp understand-
ing of them 

jeff is Simply wrong when 
he say that people do not 
learn to read or write . 
Understanding difficult 
books is a learned talent, 
enhanced by interaction 
with those who do it better 
than ourselves. You have 
only to read papers you 
turned In a year or two ago 
to see how much progress 
you ha\ e made in reading 
as well as writing jeff is 
right in saying that we 
could do a better job if we 
had a larg(:'f teaching staff 
(though in saying this he 

presume~ there is a job to 
do) . It is very comfortable 
to excuse ourselves from a 
hard job because we can 
imagine a ltuatlon in which 
it woule! be easier. The state 
will not give us re~ources to 
do more. 

eV(:'fdl olher tones jeff 
threw .,hould be thrown 
back FIr'1. when he says

Women's

Smashes Palomar 
The women's volleyball team has been finding it 

difficult to practice thi s season because the men 's 
baske tball tcam now dominates the gym. After being 
push d out of the gym and onto the cement by a karate 
(lass, the volleyball team is now practicing at 7 a.m. (can

from Del Mar that early in the morning?) . It just goes to

BLOOD BANK

With the invention of multiple-story buildings came 
the birth of the water-fight. In those ancient days, a 
water-fight consisted of emptying a bucket of bath 
water, rancid soup, or some equally disgust ing solution 
on a more or less unsuspecting victim. Of course, a 
belligerent who was on a story above his victim had a 
decided advantage. And it wasn't until the invention of 
the paper bag that any cross-story parity was achieved. 

The paper bag had its limitations, however . Paper 
bags, no matter how well constructed, were still just 
that paper bags. They had the annoying property of 
disgorging their contents on the thrower as often as on 
the receiver. But thanks to the consistent development 
of water-fight technology, we now have the most 
efficient instrument of mindles inundation to dat : The 
Water Balloon. Because of the water balloon, the water-
fight . is the sport we know today; a sport requiring 
phYSical endurance and animal cunning. 

An Analysis of the Water-Fight 
Freud, in his perverted conception of the cosmos, 

saw the water-fight as a "harmless manifestation of 
latent sadism." " ... justification enough," he said, "for 
introducing it into penal reformatories." 

So far as I know, no prison has yet instituted the 
water-fight into its reform program. Instead, 
penologists are testing the efficacy of a water-fight 
program in related institutions-college dormatories, for 
example. 

As further vindication of Freud's theory of water-
fights, interviews with 36 Revelle College seniors have 
revealed : 

• 98,6% of the seniors participated in a water-fight at 
least once. 

• 79.3% found water-fights to be more fulfilling 
during periods of great tension, such as exam week, 

Graduate Schools 
Seek Minorities 

PRI CETO, .J, - A 
new program designed to 
help the nation's graduate 
schools seek out potential 
slUdents from minority 
groups is underway this fall . 

Called the Minority 
Graduate tudent Locater 

ervice, the program is 
offered by Educational 
Testing Service. ETS es-
timates that about 10,000 to 
15,000 students could in-
itially use the new service 
which is offered fr e to 
both students and in-
stitutions thi year. 

According to J. Bradlev 
Williams, ET director of 
the project, "One of the 
.Jroblems facing graduate 
schools seeking to increa~e 

nrollment of ~tuden t s 
from racial and ethnic 
minorities is that of Iden-
tifying potential stud nts." 

Now, students will have a 
chance to vo lul1tarily com-
plete a special 17-item 
queqionnaire a, one step 
towards ent ring graduate 
~chool.

Admissions officers may 
then contact students 
directly and invite the 
applications of those whose 
particular intNesls could be 
served by their schools' 
graduate offerin!(c 

The locater service will 
be us d fir t by graduate 
schools in Dec According 
to Williams , some 300 

~chools are expected to join 
IhlS ear with more offering

" You Want to Play 
_'f you a.re a college student and wou'ld 'like to Indulge in 
water-fights dUring your leisure time, there a few things 
you should know. 

T~ ~~gin w!th , the neophyte should try to dlrert hiS 
hostilities .agalnst anyone holding a water balloon who 
IS .not a friend. Sooner or later, given half a chance he 
wtll try to get you. The Goden Rule as tnterpr ted by 
Attlla the Hun applies here. Lacking armed targets 
prof ssors, night watchmen, and TA's are prime targets ' 
The reasons should be obvious. 

Another thi~g to remember is to aVOid thrOWing 
balloons at wlnd.ows. A broken Window can spell 
expense and pOSSible humiliation. 

Finally, it is good to keep in mind that ReSident 
Assistants (RA's) are an endangered species and should 
be prot~cted . There IS no sport in chaSing down one of 
thes~ pitiable creatures. Hitting Resident Deans IS also 
conSidered poor form . When cornered, Deans can 
prove to .be nasty customers indeed. 

In enulng this . treallse, I would like to thank the 
follOWing for their contributions 

The University of California at San Diego for the use 
of It~ research facilities at Argo Hall ; , 

The reSident s of the fifth floor of Argo for their 
extreme feistiness, 

The freshman class of Revelle College for their 
tremendous procliVity to moral decav ' ' 

And to my parents, for havtng me'. It was qUite a 
gesture.
