academic year and $1 .4 million 
in unallocated cuts; and tran -

Study finds UC admits more 
students from affluent schools 

By BRYAN TSAO 
Associate News Editor 

In a swdy of 1,069 California 
high schools, researchers found 
that the University of California 
was much more likely to accept 
stl.dents attending high schools in 
afflu ent areas. 

The study was was conducted 
by Isaac Martin, a postdoctoral 
fellow at the C Institute for 
Labor and Employment, Jerome 
Karabcl, a UC Berkeley sociolo-
gist and Roc kridge Institute 
Senior Fellow and Sean Jaquez, a 
Lo ngeles attorney. 

The researchers found that 42 
percent of all graduates from the 
50 schools sending the mo t sw-
dents to the University of 
California were admitted, while 
only 2 percent were admitted 
frol11 the bottom 50 schools. 

The study ha garnered atten-
tion from , among others, the Los 
Allgeles 7'711es and the Universiry 
of Ca lifornia Office of the 
President. 

"A few luck,), swdents attend 
~chools lhat are like a royal road 
into C, while many others go to 
schools that are more like an 
obstacle course," Martin sa id . 
"Which one your chool will be 
depends largely on how affluent 
the student body is, by measures 
like housing values, parental 
income or parental education." 

The study contends that UC 
admissions policies are unfairly 
biased toward swdents graduati ng 
from affluent high schools. It 
found large disparitie separating 
the affluent schools from average 
public school . 

Students from private college 
preparatory high schools were 
admitted to UC campuses at a 
rate of 38 percent, compared to 
28 percent for private high 
chools and 13 percent for public 
chools. 

Highly affluent Arcadia High 
School had 370 out of 799 stu-
dents admitted into the Universiry 
of California in 1999, while the 50 
high school s with the fewest Stl..-
dents admitted t the Univer ity 
fo Cali fornia sent 191 out of a 
combined 9,600 graduates to the 
University of California. 

"These inequalities exist 
because the UC's eli gibi li ty crite-
ria overemphasize crude and con-
text-insensitive measures like the 
S.A.T. that tend to reward stu-
dents who already have the most 
resources," Martin sai d. "The 
state is currently failing to live up 
to the promise of its own Master 
Plan for Higher Education, and it 
is failing on a scale that is truly 
historic. Addressing these 
inequalities should be a top prior-
ity for our elected and appointed 
officials. " 

The study come at a time 
when comprehensive review, an 
admissio.lS policy that aims to 
take into account a student's back-
ground in addition to grades and 
test scores, has come under fire 
from UC Board of Regents Chair 
John Moores. He recently pub-
lished a report showing UC 
Berkeley had accepted a number 
of tudents with AT I cores 
below 1,000. In addi tion, K-12 
outreach programs at the 
University of California are now 
in jeopardy following Gov. 

Arnold chwarzenegger's propos-
al to eliminate funding for U 
and CSU outreach programs. 

Hugh Mehan, director of 
UCSD's Center for Research on 
Educational Equity, Assessment 
and Teaching Excellence was 
unable to comment at press time. 

With seemingly inevi tabl e 
budget cuts to the C system, 
the Board of Regents indicated 
after its Nov. 15 Regents meet-
ing that enrollment caps are like-
ly, which could also hinder the 
chances of studen ts from less 
afflue nt schools. 

Despi te the report's concl u-
sions, C campuses still accept an 
unusually large percentage of low-
income students, accordi ng to 
both UCSD Director of Financial 
Aid Vince DeAnda and to rank-
ings published by U .S. ews and 
World Report. 

Among U.S. ews' tOP 40 
ranked public and private univer-
sities in 2002 , UCLA, UC 
Berkeley and UC D enrolled the 
highest percentages of low-
income tudents, with 34.8, 30.1 
and 28.7 percent, respectively. 

"Relative to Ivy League, 
Stanford and other elite schools, 
UCSD does seem to have a lot of 
low-income students and a lot 
more middle-income students," 
DeAnda said. "It might be the 
overall cost of education [causing 
thisl, because even if [low-income 
students] get grants, they sti ll have 
a lot of loans that they have to take 
out."

Federal financial aid 
formula readjusted 
Revisions could cost

By MARNmE FEDERIS 
Associate News Editor 

A readjustment of the U.S. 
Department of Education's finan cial 
aid formula that would change some 
Stl..dent's eligibi li ty for federal aid is 
now under review by Congres . 

ccording to experts, however, 
Congress is likely to stop these 
changes from being applied to the 
2004-05 chool yea r. 

A report released by the 
Congressional Research ervice 
showed that the adjustment would 
prevent 84,000 students in 
California from receiving Pell 
Grants, which would also effective-
ly make them ineligible for other 
forms of aid. The Department of 
Education's changes ultimately 
would lower the amount of deduc-
tions that a family can make, which 
in rum would make it appear that 
some families have larger incomes 
and could make greater contribu-
tions. 

Financial aid is usually deter-
mined by how much a family can 
contribute to a student's education. 
Families are allowed to deduct how 
much they spend depending on 
sta te taxes. 

U Because of the adjustment to 
state taxes, the contributions go up 
relatively small amounts, so about I 
million students get slightly lower 
Pell Grants by 200 to 300 dollars," 
said director of the Advisory 
Committee for Higher Education 

Brian Fitzgerald. 
However, Fitzgerald aid that 

since the minimum award of the 
Pell Grant is 400 dollars, the pro-
posed changes could mean that stu-
dents could drop below that mini-
mum and lose the entire grant. 

According to Fitzgerald, there 
would also be effects .11 ~tate grants 
since other fonns of aid make up 
part of an award package. Because 
those funds have to go to Pell recip-
ients, some srudcnts could stand to 
lose a ubstantial amount of money. 

"The effects of the changes are 
not huge in terms of the Pell grant, 
but for ~ome individuals, there can 
be cumulative l osse~," Fitzgerald 
said. 

According to UCS D Financial 
Aid Director Vince Dc nda, there 
are currently 5 ,900 ~tudent on 
campus who receive the Pell Grant. 
UC 0 awa rded o,'cr $1++ million 
dollars in financial aid for the 
2003-200i chool year. 

" It would affect just about all 
the aid that the university givcs," 
De Anda said. "In fact, it would 
affect all my need-based financial 
aid, which is 90 percent of the 
financial aid here." 

The changes were first 
announced in May when the 
Department of Education ci ted 
obligations under federal law to re-
adju t the value of family and stu-
dent contributions according to data

Strategic 
timing of 

stri ke hurts 
students, 
but the 

university 
-must 

acquiesce 
to demands 

W ith over 200,000 students facing the prospect of canceled classes, ungraded papers and transcripts stained with incompletes, it' 
becoming increasingly clear where the UC Board of 
Regents' priorities lie. 

And that is definitely not with the students. 
The planned United Auto Worker strike for the 

first week of December would completely immobilize 
over 10,000 UC Academic Student Employees in a bid 
for the right to sympathy strikes. 

Depending on your per pective, the timing of the 
strike either couldn't be better, or couldn't be worse. 
That is to say, you can bet the UC administration will 
feel it. But thar's nothing compared to how the strike 
could impact the students. 

ASEs - which include J: and tutors - are 
absolutely essential to the UC system. In undergradu-
ate courses, it's not uncommon for students to have vir-
tually no interaction with their professors. Foreign lan-
guage courses, for example, are taught entirely by TAs, 
as are many individual college requirements such as 
MUIr 40, not to mention ruscussion sections and labs. 

0, with linals beginning in exactly one week, stu-
dents are now facing the prospect of not having clas 
meetings again before the exams hit. (fhat is, of 
cour c, If the finals aren't canceled due to a lack ofTAs 
to grade and facilitate them.) 

A ov. 25 pre ~ rclea e from the UC flice of the 
Prc~ldents \Neb site stated, "The univcrmy very much 
regrets the union' choice to a k our employees to con-
Sider partlcipaung in another Illegal pre-Impasse strike, 
espeCially one at thiS ume of year when a ~trikc would 
~erlously di advantage hard-working U students who 
are In the midst of exam ." 

Severely disadvantage' A disadvantage is missing a 
day or two of class. LO!>lIlg a textbook in . ei cI, per-
haps - but nothlllg for willch you'd pay, say, $5,247 
per year, which i how much each C student pays in 
mandatory fees . 

We're tallang more than a di advantage here: In

hell out yearly, classes fight before final - arguably 

the m t cruCial one of the quarter - Will be canceled 
or babysat by subsututcs unfamiltar With the course. 

The timing, of course, was possibly the most strate-
gic move the U W could have made. For bener or for 
wor c, thl~ one Will leave a mark. Already, the UC 
Regen are turning the blame solely on the trilong 
worker~. 

Tne UCOP statement It ts what the Regents cur-

rently provide for ASEs (and makes it clear they con-
sider more than fair compensation): a little under $20 
an hour, health insurance, waived educational fees and, 
best of all, "World-class learning: A chance to work 
with faculty at the world's premier public re earch uni-
verSity." 

But it leave, apparently, something to be desired. 
Granted, this time the UAWs motivation for a strike 
(the right to stage future sympathy strikes) isn't per-
haps one of those basic human rights causes. 
Nevertheless, rather than issuing press statements to 
make the ASEs sound like whining, ungrateful brats, 
the RegentS should be bending over backwards to start 
negotiations, or at least give students more assurance 
than a consolation a vague as ~UC campuses have 
contingency plans in place to deal with strikes and to 
help ensure that in trlIctional activitie , as well as gen-
eral university operations, will continue with as littJe 
di ruption as possible". For the total of about $1 bil-
lion that 200,000 tudents pay each year, there's a def-
inite responsibility on the part of the Regents to deliv-
er a whole lot more than a last-ditch "contingency 
plan" to salvage the education for which students are 
paying. 

til an ideaJ world - or even in a remotely ane one 
- the students would be the focus of every school. In 
reality, the University of California' A ' are every bit

Proposed UC budget cuts are sound 
Only extraneous programs will be affected 

New laws will not 
cure indoctrination 

By DUSTIN FREUCH 
Senior Staff Writer 

A few weeks ago, some rightly 
argued that electing Arnold 
Schwarzenegger ro the California 
governor's mansion was a good 
thing for University of alifornia 
students . Commentators argued 
that a fiscally responsible gover-
nor is precisely what we need to 
ensure that out-of-control pend-
ing is curtai led, so as to not pre-
cipitate future student fee 
hikes. 

Since then, Schwarzeneggcr 
has proposed a UC budget cut of 
$18-4 million for the current 
school year. And although UC has 
announced no plans to increasc 
student fees following the news, 
we can expect next year' students 
to be unpleasantly surpri ed if this 
cut is adopted by the state legisla-
ture. 

But the fact that Gov. 
Schwarzenegger proposed ro cut 
f,mds from the U system should 
not changc anyone's mind . For the 
most part, he's trimming extrane-
ous fat from the budget, choosing 
to snip over 6 percent of the 
$18.4 million from UC outreach 
programs. And with the atrocious 
state budget - a deficit of over 
$25 billion - cuts such as these 
arc necessary to recoup money 
lost under former Gov. Gray 
Davis' watch. 

In competition with the idea of 
budget cuts, an increase in taxes is 
not the an wer. \Vhy hould voters 
pay for the mistakes of the past 
administration from their own 
pockets? But neitller should stu-
dents . Impertll1ent UC programs

especially tho e that have nothing 
to do with the education of current 
UC attendees. 

The program taking the brunt 
of the funding cut is the University 
of California Early Academic 
Outreach Program. Its goal is to 
help "California ' educationally dis-
advantaged students turn dreams 
into reality," EAOP states on its 
Web ite. 

In practice, it means that disad-
vantaged high school students, 
defined by the University of 
California, receive preferential 
treatment by having the fortune of 

" Impertinent UC 
programs should be cut in 
times like these, especially 
those that have nothing to 
do with the education of 
current UC attendees." 

being targeted by EAOP. The pro-
gram smacks of derogation - it 
tells certain student that their 
admission into UC can only be 
made possible through extra help 
from the school system itself. 

Only here, OP argues, will 
sntdents "get the help they need ro 
prepare for admission to the 
University of California." But what 
of other UC applicants? Well, 
according to the Univer ity of 
California, they can handle it on 
their own. I low's that for a confi-
dence builder? 

But EAOP argues that the edu-
cational program hel ps more than 
"85,000 California students achieve 
their full academic potential and 
realize their dreams of a college 
cducation." 

What they left out is that this 
help comes at the expense of other 
UC applicants not recciving special 
treatment. After all, there are only 
:llimited number ofUC admissions 
openings. 

Critics of the propo ed budget 
cuts, however, see it in a different 
light. 

While former UCSD chancel-
lor and newly installed University 
of California President Robert C. 
Dynes concedes that the universi-
ty has its "role in the tate's solu-
tion to its budget gap," he voiced 
his concern about the propo ed 
funding cuts in a ov. 25 press 
release. 

" I am particularly concemed by 
the proposal to eliminate state 
funding for UC outreach pro-
grams to the public schools in 
California," Dynes stated. 
" Improving student achievement 
throughout the public schools 
remain a major challenge facing 
our state, and UC outreach pro-
grams arc making an important 
contribution to the effort." 

Assemblyman Marco 
Firebaugh (D - South Ga te) also 
joined Dynes in scaring the edu-
cationally minded, accusing the 
cuts of undermining public educa-
tion. 

"UC took devastating cuts in 
the current budget," Firebaugh 
aid. "To pile on additional cuts to 

those already made I to truly

T o say college campuses are liberal is like saying water is wet," said Colorado 
State Sen. John Andrew (R-
Colo.) this past week Hi state-
ment is so true that even this jus-
tification of that sentence is 
redundant. However, it is in his 
proposed re ponse to this bias 
that he goes far astray. 

In reaction to growing resent-
ment of political indoctrination in 
Colorado's public universities, the 
senator threatened to enact legisla-
tion to protect conservative stu-
dents from professors that bully 
those of other ideological tand-
points. The exact form of these 
proposed laws is largely undefined 
and is, for the moment, more of a 
threat than the beginnings of a bill. 

While a great many univer ity 
professors are indeed shamcle s 
in their anempts to forcibly influ-
ence the deci ions of their stu-
dents, e;'(ecuting laws to punish 
them is extremely unwise for 
many reasons. 

The mo t obvious one, and the 
reason the Colorado Democrats 
quickly denounced Andrew's 
threat, is that any legislature pro-
hibiting teaching styles will quick-

Iy degenerate into a Witch hunt. 
They are fight. Any hyper ensitive 
conservative student might cry foul 
at the mere implications of an anti-
government commel1t_ Professors 
would be reduced to walkmg on 
egg shells, which helps no ooe. 
The same complaints from conser-
vatives - being mindlessly namc-
called simply because of a differ-
encc in opinion - would quickly 
become the weapons of those who 
first deplored it. 

One watchdog group, 
Accuracy in Academia, has 
already fallen into such an ill-
repute, being called a 
"McCarthyist" organization try-
ing to suppress every viewpoi nt 
but their own. Since the vast 
majority of teaching at universi-
ties is slanted left, any action IA 
takes is against liberal profes ors. 
The amount of time AlA spends 
persecuting liberal ideology 
clearly causes its categorization 
as a partisan group, effectively 
eliminating its credibility. 

Even more disquieting, if uch 
legislature fell into the proverbial 
"wrong hands" - in this case, the 
already intimidating college left 
- conservative students would be 
in an even grimmcr situation than 
they a I ready are.

\vith a yearly budget of over 
6 0 million, according to the C 

Budget for Capital Improvements, 
the 1 .4 million in Cut this year 
make up Ie s than .03 percent. 
That hardly translate to the 
undermining of our public school 
system as Firebaugh and Orne 
see It. 

Politics aside, arguments to be 
made against trimming the fat 
from the UC budget are fragile at 
be t. Program that have nothing 
to do with the education of UC 
students have no place u urping 
UC fund, giving an advantage to 
students preferred by the 
University of California and 
howing the bias of university 

admissions. 
Schwarzenegger is right to cut 

funding for programs such as these, 
especially under the current cir-
cumstances. And if the university 
decide to raise student fees once 
again next year, chwarzenegger 
will not be to blame - a majority 
of the cuts deal with external pro-
grams, and amount to an in ignifi-
cam percent of the yearly UC bud-
get. 

Simply put, current UC stu-
dents should nOt be made to pay for 
the outreach programs of preferred 
UC applicants. Should the univer-
sity decide to continue these pro-
grams, it must look for money else-
where, and would do well not to a k 
for it from the students they pur-
pon to serve. 

THE U D GUARDIAN 

Yank: It is too difficult to 
determine professor's 'intent' 

cominued from page 5 
ganda or bullying would be ludi-
crous. Then, to decide whether or 
not the c definitions warrant a 
pWli hment - and subsequently, 
how severe a punishment - would 
be impo ible. 

In this ca e, the legislation 
would require the government to 
determine the intent of the pro-
fessor. This i the kind of govern-
mental intru ivenes that conser-
vative rightly abhor in other lib-
eral policy, such as hate crime 
legislation. Conservative policy-
makers, or at least con ervative 
ideologlle , should actually be the 
first to condemn the idea. 

College conservatives them-
elves should be against this idea, 

since it acts as an obstacle toward 
the goal of recruiting more like-
minded students. At the moment, 
students are beginning to turn 
against the slants and propaganda 
of the lecture halls. ationwide, 
college conservative groups have 
tripled in numbers in as many 
year. Last year, another 22 ,000 
tudents joined conservative orga-

nizations. Outside help is actually a 
crutch, as is help from mommy 
and daddy when the bigger kids 
push them on the playground. 

Many students joining these 
clubs are similar to the revolu-
tionaries of the 1960s. They are 
reactionaries against an iron-fist-
ed status quo. If the movement is 
given a sympathy vote by the gov-
ernment, their reactionary status 
will be crippled. 

Furthermore, conservative stu-
dents are still generally far more 
liberal than both the mainstream 
conservative public and, more 
poignandy, the previou genera-
tion of conservatives. Assi tance 

from Ivy League Republicans and 
tuffy pipe-smoking millionaires 

thoroughly damages the imag of 
the conservative purist that mo t 
students are gunning f, r. 

The professors, it seems, are 
largely unaware of dIe pre ent 
reactions and damage their own 
reputations can cau e, more than 
legislation ever could. As people 
stop listening to the rants, the pro-
fessors just resort to yelling louder. 

uch an example is Profe or 
Rosalyn Kahn of Citru College, 
who recendy offered extra credit to 
students in a required course for 
writing letters to President Bush, 
but denied students credit if the 
letter wasn't both anti-war and 
actually sent to Washington. 

This SOrt of lunacy damages 
the liberal ideology enough on its 
own. To enact law to crucify this 
woman would not only appear to 
be outright censorship, but would 
also grant her a martyr's status. 

While it i beneficial to every-
one that Sen. Andrews is publiciz-
ing the indoctrination on campus, 
trying to pass laws to curb it is both 
dangerous and hypocritical. As the 
pa t several years have shown, 
when a professor goes too far, the 
students and the public respond. 
Thus, it is better for the students 
to see for themselves what the 
agenda of the professors is, rather 
than to attempt to force feed it to 
them with a legislative poon. 
With minimal outside help, Stu-
dents will be thinking for them-
selves. That is what we are sup-
posed to be learning in college 
anyway.

on state taxes from the year 2000. 

"The Department of Education 
is required by law to update the tax 
table used to compute financial 
aid," said Department of 
Education spokesperson Jane 
Glickman. "But Congress has 
takcn reps to postpone me imple-
mentation of the newer tax tables." 

f lowever, the curre nt data 
reflected the economic circum-
stances of the 1990s whcn state 
taxes were decreasing. 'I11e depart-
ment had changed its fa nlJly livlrlg 
allowance based on state taxes that 
are only periodically updated . 
According to the D. .E.'s data, 
sta te taxes have been on the rise 
si nce dlC mid- '90s, but the depart-
ment was required to readju t its 
formula even with tile economic 
cicci inc toward end of 19905 and 
the rise of state taxes. 

"The fundamental que tion is 

whether or not these state tax 
tables really reflect what families 
are paying now," Fitzgerald said. 
"Many have questioned whether 
it wa wise to implement a table 
that reflects lower tax burdens 
when we know it has risen." 

The changes would come into 
J an. I , pending Congress 
approval. Experts have predicted 
that the Congress is likely to put 
limitations on the bill that would 
prohibit the department from 
using the old tax tabl es. 

T he H ouse is lated to vote on 
the measure on Dec. 8, whde the 

enate is nOf expected to vote 
until January. 

"I think that it was a good 
move that they stopped the 
adju tmenr until they had a 
chance to look at it," De Anda 
said. "At least Congress is looking 
at it and I uppose that they'll 
tweak it a little bit." 

conrinucd from page J 
one about the crimes, Wahlig said. 

"The reality is that most don't 
get reported, period, whether you're 
on campus or off campus," she said. 

The most recent statistics on the 
effect of exual assaults on college 
women, released jointly by the 

ational [nsotute of Justice and the 
Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2001 , 
found that roughly 3.5 percent of all 
fema le college sUldents experience 
completed or attempted rape dUring 
a typical college year. 

The report also found that fewer 
than half of women consider their 
victimization as rape, and only one 
out of 20 reported it to the police.

every additional budget cut to the 
Univcrsity of California is a painful 
cut," Dynes said. "Our ability to 
preserve this institutions world-
class quality and continue making a 
major contribu1:ion to Californias 
economy will be compromised by 
these growing budget cuts." 

The university has not yet 
decided how it will determine the 
$18.4 million in unallocated Cllts. 
During the Board of Regents 
meeting on ov. 15, the Regents 
announced that further hikes in 
student fees and enrollment caps 
would be pos ible responses to 

budget cuts. 
The California State 

University system would also be

how many break-ins and how many 
'abductions' there were, but it didn't 
really factor into my decision." 

The differences, according to 
Wahlig, have more value in showing 
where crimes occur, not necessarily 
how many. 

"I think that if I were a parent

THE U D GUARDIAN NEW 9 

Strike: TAs won't teach , help or grade Mideast: Finkelstein 
proposes solution to conflict continued from page I Workers, which represents over 

11,000 leaching assistants through-
out the Univer ity of California\; 
eight undergraduate campu es. 

According to union b'l.lidelines, 
participating teaching assistants 
would not be able to teach clas es, 
hold office hours, send e-mail or 
grade any student WOl k, including 
flnal exams. 

With finals week coming up, 
many students may be left without 
last-minute help or review sessions. 

Contingency plans are being 
et up at each campus to deal with 

the strike's effects. At UCSD, 
while the strike has been discussed 
in meetings by administration 
officials and faculty, specific plans 
are being set up by individual 
departments and programs. 

"It i up to the chair and the 
faculty in each department to see 
how to best approach the itua-
tion," said Tim Johnston, assistant 
dean of student affair for gradu-
ate studIes. 

majority of teaching assis-
tants on each campus are U W 
members, according to the union. 

.. ome of the courses may not 
be disrupted by the strike, H 
Johnston said. "Others may 
require that they replace those 
people, or have faculty take over." 

Johnston said that the tempo-
rary replacements would have to 
be "qualified people" affi liated 
with UC D, which could be 
either graduate student or "non-
tudent" employees chosen from a 

pool of former applicants. 
Another option would be to 
extend hours of teaching assistants 
not on strike. 

\Nhile the union has announced 
that the strike will take place 
between Dec. I and Dec. 5, no spe-
cific date has been announced for 
fear of campuses preemptively hir-
ing temporary replacements. 

Days before Thanksgiving, as 
oon a AW voted on the strike, 

teaching assistants started posting 
UAW membership cards on their 
office doors, discu sing the rea-
sons behind the strikes in their 
cia rooms and writing the phone 
number to Acting Chancellor 
Marsha i\.. Chandler' office on 
blackboards for students to call. 

U A W member went on a one-
day strike on ct. 3 to express 
their dissatisfaction with the bar-
gaining between the union and 
the university. A\V ha accused 
the university of unfair labor prac-
tices, including bringing negotia-
tors lacking necessary authority to 
the table. 

The only point of contention 
in the contract negotiation has 
been the union 's rights to go on 
"sympathy strikes, H strike during 
work hour in upport of other 
unions. The university wants the 
student instructor's union to give 
up the right to "sympathy strikes" 
in their new contract. 

" \OVe had a trong majority 
action on Oct. 3, and we returned 
to work with the expectation of an 
improvement in thc university's 
condu t at the table," aid Rajan 
Mehta, a member of the UAW 
bargaining team, in a Nov. 2 
statement announcing the deci-
sion to strike. "However, the uni-
versity appears unwilling to bar-
gain fairly." 

In Novcmber, both parties 
entered voluntary pre-impas e 
talks. 

" 0 long as they do not violate 
university I'olicy, student in tru -
tor are free to join in any demon-
strat1on~ or prot 15 the)' chao e, 
union-related or othclwb ," 
poke man Paul hwartz aid. 

"And there is notlung in the uni-
versit 's current bargaining pro-

posal~ with the U W that would 
prohIbit academic tudent 
employe of Joining [he picket 
lines of Dlher unions on their own 
persona I ri II1C." 

B th Rayfield, who repr nts 
U 111 outhern alifomia, fcll 
that the universit hould nOl OL~k 

the TAs to give up sympathy strikes. 
"You can't earn labor peace by 

this kind of repression," Rayfield 
said. "The length of the strike is 
now really up to the univer ity. 

ur members are outraged. 
Thousands have signed up for 
picketing and are prepared to stay 
out there for the rest of the term." 

University librarians recently 
gave up the righl to sympathy 
strikes in a contract reached in 
November. Thi followed several 
other unions, including lecturers, 
that have given up sympathy strike 
language when the university asked. 

"Solidarity is a great strength, 
and the thing to note here is that 
lthe librarian J are one of the 
smaller unions," Mehta said. "The 
university ha a program to get 
this language into all contracts." 

According to Rayfield, the 
UAW has now filed 72 unfair labor 
practice charges against the univer-
sity, up from 64 in September. 

Univer ity officials have argued 
that filing these charges does not 
represent wrongdoing, and deci-
sions on charges by the state's 
independent Public Employment 
Relations Board can take months 
and might not necessarily come 
out in the union' favor. 

" ome unions use this a a tac-
tic to attempt to vilify an employ-
er, gain public sympathy and pres-

sure an employer into agreeing to 
union demands," Schwanz said in 
a statement. 

Rayfield said filing the charges 
gives the union the legal right to 
strike. The strike i n t expected 
to last into winter quarter, howev-
er, since teaching assistants are 
hired on a term-by-term basis. 

"Strikes don't serve anyone and 
differences can only be resolved at 
the bargaining table, not the streel 
corner," chwartz. said. "As other 
unions and the general public have 
witnessed repeatedly, strikes have 
no effect on the university'S bar-
gaining positions, and they only 
serve to aggravate negotiations 
and delay an agreement." 

evera.l unions, including the 
Coalition of University Employees, 
will honor UAWs picket lines. 

The union also garnered up-
POrt in the form of a letter sent to 
President Robert C. Dynes on 

ov. 19, before the bargaining 
team voted to strike. The letter, 
igned by 30 California lebrisla-

tors, asked Dynes to leave the 
UAW's contract Iangmge as is. 

"I support unions, although 1 
admit it's bad timing becau e stu-
dents need TAs during this time," 
said John Muir College sopho-
more Narissa Vania. "[n a lot of 
cia ses, TAs are who the srudents 
learn from." 

continued from page I 
compared the Palestinians to the 
Native Americans. 

"Make the analogy ... what's 
being done now in Palestine is also 
a colossal wrong," he said. "But, we 
can't make that analogy. We can't 
compare, because if we compare 
and make all the 10brical compar-
ison , the Zionist argument doesn 't 
look good at the end of the day." 

San Diego Israel lIiance 
President Wayne Klitosl.:y, who 
attended the lecture, said the com-
parison "didn't hold any weight." 

"Finkelstein continuously called 
Pale tinians the indigenous people 
when the Jewi h people have been 
there since the beginning of time," 
he said. "The way he described it, 
you'd think Jew never came to 
1 rae I and just' carne out of some-
where in Europe and started killing 
Palestinians. There is more to the 
story." 

In his lecrure, Finkelstein pro-
posed a solution to the conflict. He 
discussed the idea of a two-State 
settlement, which would ca ll for 
Israel to fully withdraw and 
Pale tine to fully recogniz.e Israel 
a a state. 

Some tudents in attendance 
liked what Finkelstein had to say. 

"He supported his cause 100 per-

cent based on research," UCSD 
alumna Cas andra \Villiams said . 
"I Ies not Palestinian at birth, so he\; 
not biased. He came blank-faced and 
came to these conclusions." 

Amir Fahid, president of the 
Muslim Students Association, 
agreed. 

"I liked how we brought aJewish 
lustorian to talk about the Isracli-
Palestinian conflicr," he said. 

Klitosky said that the Israel 
Alliance had no problem With the 
MSA hosting speakers. 

"Although we 'd never agree 
with them politically. we still 
respect them," K1itosky ~aid . "We 
had a problem wi th this particular 
speaker. He is known to verba lly 
abuse members of the audience, 
which was a concern of mine." 

At one point, Finkelstein said, 
"Sometimes, I want to strangie 
Israelis," which Klito ky felt was 
"not an acceptable comment." 

Eric Cohen, \ice president of 
the I rae! AJliance. also felt that tile 
peaker was biased. 

"I think he provided a very nar-
row view when he put all the blame 
on Israel and didn't look at the 
issue as a whole," he aid. 

Finkelstein has published three 
other books, including "The Rise 
and Fall of PalC5one."

Addictions run the gamut, but for Ron Carlson, director of UC D's Crafts Center, glass-
blowing is the ticket. 

"It's like heroin," he aid. "I don't 
carc how much it costs and I can't 
stop." 

Unlike many others, an art addic-
tion provides the context for real per-
sonal growth, and the Crafts Center 
offers a unique environment where 
you can foster one. estled between 
Bonner Iiall and The Hump on the 
far south boundary of John Muir 
College lies this lesser-known cam-
pus jewel. 

It may come as a surprise that the 
Crafts Center preceded Student 
Center, now a main artery of student 
exchange. In 1972, architect Chuck 
Powers assembled four storage sheds 
that were later transformed into a 
darkroom, a lciln room, a ceramics 
studio and office space. Ot long 
after the building was assembled, an 
anonymous donor relinquished his 
ponery wheel and kil n to the UJll\'c r-
Slty; the Craft, Centcr was qUickly 
lIlundatcd with ceralTIlcs-lover an

Today the center boa ts enty

close to 0 courses that c:lter to

Thc high-caliber teacrung taff con-
sist of 46 permanent instructors, 
who, according to Carlson, are not 
just dabblcrs, but practiclllg profes-
Sional with either a degree in their

experience. [n addition, vi iting 
artist teach frequent workshops. 
U pcomi ng workshops for this year 
give student the opportuni 0 
explore soap making, ba ket weaving, 
jewelry wire working, gla fusing, 
mosaic art and candle making. 

"People don't realize the vast 
re ources we have here," Carlson ald. 
"I would venture to guess that we have 
more course fferings and disciplines 
than any other n n-accredlted craft 
center in the country." 

Thi clallll hould not be taken 
lightly, as arlson has traveled across 
the nation to visit other university 
craft centers to glean techniques and 
ideas from them.

said. "As a studen t, you have le isure

Students walk for the cure 
Charity, walks raise money and awareness 

Jennifer Downs/Guardion 
Making strides: UCSD students took part In the Making Stndes Against Breast Cilncer Walk In October at Balboa Park. 

By JAMIE FREDRICKSON 
Contributing Writer 

Every 12 minutes a woman in 
America dies of breast cancer. 
Brea t cancer foundations aero s 
the globe have worked rigorously 
in the past few years to earn money 
for research and educate women 
about the disease. They found that 
outside help was essential, that 
community involvement for the 
cause was crucial in raising dollars 
and awarene s, and so began the 
rise of charity walks. 

Charity walks allow people of all 
ages and backgrounds to come 
together and show support for the 
breast cancer struggle. Breast cancer 
affects so many people's lives because 
at the rate that the disease is discov-
ered In women, it is likely that near-
ly every person in the country will 
know someone affected by breast 
cancer. Over the years, many walks 
have been organized and created 
throughout the world, but three 
large foundations that have touched 
down in an Diego recently are the 
American Cancer Society, the 
Komen Breast Cancer Foundation 
and the Avon Foundation. 

October marked the 19th annu-
al Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 
but charity and fund raising contin-
ues throughout the year. The 
Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer 
Foundation began its patient advo-
cacy, breast cancer research and 
conununication outreach programs 
20 years ago. 

It was founded on a promise 
made between twO sisters, one of 
which, Susan G. Komen, was diag-
nosed with breast cancer in 1978, 
when little was known about the 
di ease. Her sister, Nancy G. 
Brinker, promised her she would 
do everything possible to bring an 
end to breast cancer, and in 1982 
she founded thi breast cancer 
organization. Since, 5450 million 
has been collected and put toward 
defeating the disea e. 

The Avon Foundation with i 
Avon Breast Cancer Crusade has 
generated over 5250 million in 
total funds over the last 10 year . 
Thi foundation has a pecial inter-
est in reaching medically under-
served women, including low-
income, elderly and minority

"It is really great that these 
organizations are raising m ney

Throughout October and

Cancer Foundation hosted the 
Breast Cancer 3Day, a 60-mile, 
three-day walk, which they believe, 
combined with the money from the 
San Francisco and Los Angeles 
charity walks, could raise more 
than $30 million in JUSt the first 
three weeks of November. 

Among these charity walks, 
UCSD students showed suppOrt 
for the breast cancer cause by par-
ticipating in the Making Strides 
Against Breast Cancer Walk orga-
nized through the American 
Cancer Society.

which they well surpassed. The 
American Cancer Society Web site 
ranks UCSD's Greek community 
as the top collegiate group for 
fundraising and participation. 

'me American Cancer Society's 
goal for the San Diego walk was to 
reach half-a-miUion dollars and to 
have 10,000 walleers. At the event, 
12,000 walkers h wed their upport 
and more than 5430,000 wa collect-

"More important than the 
money is the number of people you 
get out there," said Pi Kappa Alpha'

breast cancer is that it can or will

The stati tics are that one in 
eight women will be diagnosed with 
breast cancer. In just one year, the 
disease will afflict 200,000 women 
and take more than 40,000 live . 
The money collected from the char-

in the Malcing Strides event 
through the American Cancer

"It has been a positive experi-

motivating to see how many people 
actually come together and show 
support."

Nothing says holidays 
like crazy customers 

The woes of retail service 
during holiday shopping 
By DUNA AL SHAm 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

Ah, ' the materialistic shopping 
season i all around us. What better 
way to celebrate the joyfulness of 
Christmas/Hanukkah/Kwanzaa 
than heading our to the malls? 

But as you' re wandering 
through the stores, keep one 
thing in mind: you, good friend, 
are nor God's gift to mankind. 
The ol~ saying is that the cus-
tomer is always right. This, how-
ever, does not give you, the cus-
tomer, the right to act rude, Stu-
pid, or above the employees. 

Now, I've only worked three 
rctail jobs in my whole life, but 
from those experiences, and talk-
ing to friends that have worked in 
retail, I've concluded that people 
are stupid. 

I've had my ditz moments 
where I walk into a store and ask 
where omething is only to have it 
be right in front of my eyes. 
That's not the kind of stupid I'm 
talking about. I'm talking about 
the kind of stupid where people 
don't even try ro use their brains. 

I've worked in two bookstores, 
and in each one I've found some 
of the stupidest people wandering 
around the ai les, asking the Stu-
pidest questions. Here's a sample 
conversation that actually took 
place: 

Customer: "Is there any way 
you can print out a list of all the 
books in the store?" 

Me: "What?" 
Customer: "I'm looking for a 

book, I can't remember the title of 

it. All I remember is that it begins 
with the letter "I." So I was hop-
ing you could print out a list so I 
could find it." 

Me: "Um, unfortunately, we 
can't do that. You can look 
through the section to see if you 
ca n find it." 

Customer: (gesturing to the 
helves) "I have to look through 

all the e books?" 
Why, yes. You do have to look 

through all those books in order 
to find what you want. If you 
knew exactly what you wanted 
and needed someone to help you, 
that wouldn't be so bad. But when 
the only information you know is 
what letter the title starts with or 
that tlle book cover is blue, you're 
not helping us figure out what the 
book is. You're helping U5 figure 
out that you're a moron. 

0, to avoid getting subpar 
customer ervice and pissing off 
your clerk, I present the Six 
Simple Shopping Rules: 

I) Just because you're in a bad 
mood doesn't giv.e you the right to 
take it out on employees of the 
store you shop at. I can't begin to 
tell you how many people throw a 
fit over the smallest detail. 
Cu comers have freaked out 
because they misread sign . If 
you're in a bad mood, avoid shop-
ping. 

2) Know. What. You. Want. 
Product numbers or I BNs are 
your friend. If you don't have that, 
at least be able to give some kind 
of descriptive detail about the

i ,glass art, jewelry and a large 
selection of fine wares crafted by 
students and instructors alike. 
While 25 percent of the proceeds 
go directly to the Crafts Center, 
students and artists pocket the rest. 
Previews for the upcoming 
December ale are on Dec. I from 
3 p.m. to 7 p.m. and offer a pletho-
ra of holiday gift ideas. 

1bings in Ijfe this wonderful 
hardly ever come free. The Crafts 
Center has to account for the cost 
of repairs and maintenance of 
material in their budget structure, 
and Carlson admits that they had 
to raise fees this past quarter. 
I lowever, courses 2re still offered 
to students at below-cost price. 

"It's money well-spent 
because the reward of creation is 
slich a po itive affirmation. It's 
worth every dollar you pay for," 
Ragsdale said. "All the extra 
matcrials you receive and the per-
onaliz.ed attention you get from 

the instructors far overc mpen-
~ate for the COSt of the cla ." 

Carlson aid he cann I tres 
enough how invaluable the art 
proce I t tudenu. at the UIlI-
ver~lty level. iung one particu-
lar example, he tOld of a former 
mctlical student from year ba k 
who vi ited him with l ar in hi 
eyes and aId, "The on ly rea n I 
made it through wa becau the 
ceramics studio was open 24 
hour a day. Th pottery wheel 

was my therapy." 
Jones also found that the 

chance for art-exploration yields 
innumerable rewards and urged 
students to take advantage of the 
Crafts Center's resources. 

"As a student, I have the luxu-
ry of figuring out what I like to 
do. Don't let an opportunity like 
this pass you by," J ones said. 

To offer an incentive to new 
and curious students, the Crafts 
Center recently instituted a seri 
of free introductory courses given 
the first week of every quarter. If 
you have ever wondered what it's 
like to 611 ncon tubing, tOrch a 
glass rod or man a floor loom, con-
ider taking this free offer to satiate 
r ur curiosity. Maybe your artistic 
zeal won't compare to Carlson's 
"addiction," but YOll might just 
find a new part of yourself YOll 
never lcnew exi tcd.

Eight,day festival 
celebrates a miracle 

Maccabees and menorah 
are origins of Hanukkah 

By JOSH SHUPACK 
Contributing Writer 

Few people know much about 
the holiday of Hanukkah. When 
asked 10 describe Ilanukkah, 
Simona Stolpner, a Thurgood 
Marshall College senior, aid 
"Chanukah is the festival of lights. 
Instead of one day of presents, we 
have eight crazy nights," quoting 
Adam Sandler. 

For th se whose knowledge of 
the holiday is entirely ba ed on 
"The hanukah Song," there is 
much more to learn about this hol-
iday, which takes place from Dec. 
19 through Dec. 27 thi year. 

According 10 Jewish traditions 
the origins of Hanukkah began a 
long time ago, in a kingdom far, far 
away. The Syrian King Antiochus 
ruled from 175 B.C. to 163 B.C. 

long years, the 1accabces won 
and regained control of Jerusalem. 

Ilanllkka h then represents the 
nuraculous viclOry of a mall rebel 
band of] ew who fought against a 
foe that was trying to wipe them 
out. But that's not nil. Jewish be li ef 
says that there wa a second nura-
de when the j\\accabees regained 
control of the temple. The je\vish 
trOOp wept at the ~ight of the 
Holy Temple defiled, and vowed 
to clean it and rcpurify it. 

They could only find one jar 
of pure olive oil to light the 
menorah, or cand elabra. The 
menorah was alway supposed to 
be lit, but there was only enough 
oil to las t for one day, and it 
would take eight days to get more 
oil. According to legend, a mira-
cle occurred, and the small jug of 

oil bsted for 
over the province 
ofJudea, which -
as the name 

" 

eight days, allow-
ing the menorah 
to burn until 
more oil could be 
made. 

implies is 
where the Jews 
lived. 

He was con-
vinced that the 
Jewi sh religion 
was at the heart of 
the opposition to 
his policy of 
Hellenization (the

Accarding to legend,

In cOllunemo-
ration of this nur-
acle, Hanukkah is 
eight days long, 
and on each day, 
candles are lit in da " Y5,., menorahs to 

Greek culture), so he decided to 
outlaw Judaism under penalty of 
death. He ordered his soldiers to 
sacrifice pigs in the Holy Temple 
and place a large statue of Zeus 
there; Jews saw both actions as 
desecrations to tlus holy site. 

Antiochus' decree sparked a 
revolt. The revolt began in 167 
B.C. in the city of Modi 'in. 
Antiochus had sent soldiers to the 
towns of Judea to force the leaders 
to sacrifice pigs. But Mattathias, 
one of the elders of the town of 
Modi'in, refused to perform the 
sacrifice. He killed the oldier and 
houted, "Follow me!" Many Jews 

followed him, beginning the 
revolt. 

The Jews were led by 
Mattathias' son Juda, nicknamed 
Maccabeus, and thus, the rebels 
were called Maccabees. The 
Maccabees hid in caves and prac-
ticed guerrilla warfare. After three 

remember this 
miracle. On the 

first night one candle is lit, on the 
second night two, and so on. 

Latkes, or potato pancakes, 
are fried in oil to remember the 
miracle of the oil. Other fried 
foods are eaten a well; in Israel a 
big favorite is ufganiyot, or jelly-
filled doughnuts. 

Another commemoration of 
the miracle is the tradition of 
playing with dreidlcs on 
Hanukkah. A drcidle is a four-
sided top, and on each side a 
Hebrew letter is printed (nun, 
gimel, hey, shin) as an acronym 
for" es Gadol Haya Sham," 
which means "A great tniracle 
ha ppened there [Israel) ." 

Dreidles are used to play a 
child's betting game. The dreidle 
is'spun and depending on which 
letter lands up, it determines 
whether the spinner gets money, 
or has to put it into the pot 
instead.

MONDAY, DECEMBER I, Z003 THE UCSDGUARDIAN PORTS 19 

Basketball: UCSD gives up 37 free throws Fall season is good to 
UCSD sports fans continued from page 20 Senior guard Ali Ginn fou led out 

with only two points and junior 
forward Katie McGann fouled Out 
with eight points . UCSD com-
mitted 26 fouls while Grand 
Canyon committed only 17 fouls. 
This overwhelming di parity gave 

rand Canyon a huge advantage 
in free throws. The Antclopes 
made 25 of the 37 free throws 
they attempted , and while the 
Tritons shot well from the frce-
throw line (14 of 18 attempts), it 
was not enough . 

Both junior center Margaret 
johnson, who had 13 points and 
10 rebound , and freshman guard 
Leora J lister, who scored 12 
points and grabbed six rebounds, 
delivered strong performances for 
the Tritons. ophomore guard 
Andrea Herold led the team with 
fhe assists.

There are times r wish I had 

gone to a school with a bigger ath-
letic program. I wish [ had gone to 
a place where the problem is 
overzealous fans and people who 
take sports too seriously. Maybe 
somewhere like Stanford. 

tem was admitting orne people 
with SAT. scorcs below 1,000. I 
guess it isn't a rllmor

'
" 

I could have also aid: "Your 
passion for your school is rather 
com mendable . Did Cal have a 
good football program back in the 

'60~ when you were there'" 
Then there is always; 

"Congratulations. Your win in the 
'big' game locked up that fourth-
place finish in the Pac- IO. 0low 
there's a commitment to excel-
lence." 

Honestly, these big programs 
have had nothll1g on UCSD this 
fall. \Ve've had our women's I'olley-
ball, men's soccer, men's and 
women's cross country and men's 
water polo teams in the playoffs -
nOt to mention the women's soccer 
team heading to the Final Four in 
Virginia this week. 

Meanwhile, 1 [ansen continued 
to play well as a fonvard substi-
tute. UCSD women' basketball 
head coach Judy Malone has been 
impressed with the freshman's 
contributions rhus far in the se3-
on. Off the bench, I Ian en con-

tributed 10 points on 4-7 shoot-
ing.

Still searching: The Tritons will seek their first victory of the season at the 
home opener against Grand Canyon on Dec. 13 at RIMACArena. 

It was just this past weekend

both comfonable and clean - the 
two deciding factors I use to deter-
mine what to wear. Anyway, my fam-
i1yand I had ju t finished selecting a

ticultural excellence that is Home

What is a 
"scholar" 
athlete? 
There's no 

love for 
athletes here 

Cyn City 
Cynthia Chavez 

The term, "scholar athlete" at 
UC D is not an unfamiliar one. 
With UC D athletes juggling an 
enonnou amount of schoolwork in 
addition to games and practices, I 
can only Imagine the truggle to 
keep on top of things off the field. 

From what I've seen of profes-
sor here at UCSD, I'm betting 
they're no t the happiest people 
when athletes inform them they wiU 
either IlU their lectures or will have 
to reschedule an exam due to a 
game. It can 't always be easy to be an 
athlete (to, at many omes. play in 
front of a par e crowd) and a stu-
dem at the ame orne. Nonetheless. 
our a th let~ overall hold a higher 
grade POin t avera"c than the gener-
al UC D student populaoon 
..... \..0. ding: 0 the athletic depart-
ment. Yes, "scholar athlete" would 
be the proper term for the Tnton 
athlete . 

Imagine my surprise when I 
found out how much scholar ath-
letes at other ~chool are catered to. 
I was vi long a friend who attends an 
athletically pro rrunent DiviSion I 
powerhouse college (think football . 
baseball . b. ketball). She tutors ath-
letes who. well. aren't the /Nn read-
ers in the world. Freshman athletes 
are required to have a tutor to 
"help" them with schoolwork 
throughout the cason and the rest 
of the school year. Unless their 
grade are good (usually they aren·t). 
the athletes have to work with tutors 
the whole time they're playing. At 
this particular chool. athletes are 
basically gods with just about every-
one worshipping the ground they 
walk on, Including lAs (one was 
reportedly quite enamored with the 
quarterback although he only 
attended class O1Ut). I anended high 
school Wlth one of these athletes 
attendmg thiS particular college. 
No. he i n't the brightest. and yes. I 
do recall him needing help with 
granunar ba ICS. 

In addition. orne of the e ath-
letes arc ensured that each and 
every tutor knows exactly who they 
are and what they've done for ule 
team. rhls system has been almost 
too good for the athletes and . 
unfortunately for them, the CAA 
caught Wind of ju t how much 
"help" they've been getong. 

Recentl y. the college ha been 
on probation because some of 
these tutor may have wTltten 
papers for their beloved athletes 
(What) Are you erious'}. 
• owadays. if an athlete i typing a 
paper on the computer. the tutor 
cannot touch the keyboard. 
I Lilanous. ow these "scholar ath-
lete " (here. I use the term loosely) 
have to learn how to type. But that 
can't be that hard because even if 
the tutor cannot touch th key-
board. I'm sure the oral dictation 
works out JUSt fine.
