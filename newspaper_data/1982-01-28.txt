BY PETER MORTENSEN 
Think back to high chool. 

Taking the Scholastic 
Aptitude Te t was a big thing. 
Good cores were a ticket to a 
good school. But no matter 
what the score , some sort of 
higher c!ducation was 
available to almost anyone 
who really wanted one. 

Now, imagine taking the 
SAT and knowing that only 
four percent of those who did 
in a single year would go onto 
college. Everyone else goes 
into the work force. No econd 
chances. 

This is the situation that 
young people in mainland 
China face today. There are no 
second chances. Prospective 
college tudents are allowed to 
apply to five specific 
department in the 600 "key" 
universitie across China. If 
they are not accepted at the 
time of their application, there 
is little opportunity for 
another chance to apply in the 
future. 

And even for tho e few who 
do make it into the university, 
life i still very uncertain. 

Atkinson in China 
Chancellor Richard Atkin-

on returned last week from a 
nine-day tour of academic 
in titutions in the People's 
Republic of China. During his 
vi it , he observed the 
"devestating" effects of the 
Mao's cultural revolution, 
including this troubled story 
of the univer ity admission 
process in China. 

"We ju t haven't appreciat-
ed the impact of the cultural 
revolution," a weary Atkinson 
told reporters last week the 
day after his return. " In actual 
fact, (the universities) were 
closed down for almost five 
years and there was literally 
continuous warfare around 
the univer ities. The Gang of 
Four view wa that the 
universities hadn't contribut-
ed to the revolution in a proper 
way and that 'omehow they 
ought to." 

Atkinson noted that th 
Maoist view held that 

University of California, San Diego/Volume 45, Number 8 / Thursday, January 28, 1982 

untversity facultie had been ' 
"educated in a Western 
tradition that empha ized 
theory and didn 't empha ize 
practice and that omehow the 
universities had to get back to 
practical matter - all the 
textbook had to be rewritten 
to take out the Western 
influence. " 

So, for 14 years, the People's 
Republic of China , with a 
population pushing 1.2 billion , 
has been without college 
graduates. The fir t four year 
graduates since the 1966 
beginning of the cultural 
revolution are now receiving 
their degrees, and Chinese 
industry is waiting with open 
arms to accept the infusion of 
university-trained blood. 

"They are trying desparate-
ly to reorganize and 
restructure their universities 
to really once agian emphasize 
the importance of an 
educational experience ," 
Atkinson aid . " If thi nation 
did not have any electrical 
e ngin eers, mechanical 
engineer or medical people 
trained in a 15 year period , it 
would impact on u in a great 
way, and this is exactly what' 
happened in China. 

Universities undermined 
"The univers itie areju t so 

undermined by the ab ence of 
faculty development and the 
like is so dramatic that the 
Chinese are really in a very 
stressful situation," Atkinson 
explained. 

He relates a story about once 
incident that points out just 
how much Chinese industry i 
in need of univer ity-trained 
engineer and technicians . 
While visiting a major 
manufacturer of large milling 
machinery in Peking, 
Atkinson was shown what the 
Chinese proudly claimed to be 
a dumpling-st amping ma-
chine. 
The company had not received 
a college graduate in seven 
year and dep nded on in-
hou e trained technician for 
manufacture de ign. 

'" gather it works pretty 
well, but it looked like a 

milling machine," he smiled. 
And it i ' not likely that this 

manufacturer will receive 
many more college graduate 
in the near future, according to 
Atkin on' description of the 
post-graduate dI stributIOn 
proce s, 

After graduation 
"Now we have the fir t 

graduating cia . How do they 
get jobs? Well , the Ministry of 
Education makes a survey of 
all the various enterprises, 
institutes and other organiza-
tion ... (regarding) what kind 
of people each need s," 
Atkin on explained . " And 
they (t he universities) get ali t 
of how many electrical 
engineers doe uch and such 
institute want, how many 
biochemists does some other 
in titute want, how many 
mechanical ngineers does the 
First Peking Manufacturing 

Compan y want 
"Of course, the Ii t i much 

longer than the number of 
_ tudents that \\1111 go to each 
group - each particular 
industry" Once these lists are 
compiled, the mini try pares 
them down to fit thenum rof 
student that will be 
graduating and send the Ii t 
to each univer ity. 

After a faculty committee 
and the department chairman 
confer with each s tudent. 
assigment are made -
assignment that are 
permanent and often require a 
radical change in life 'tyle. 

"You cannot believe the 
upset that this i making ... 
om (students) even commit 
uicide," Atkin on aid .

The saddened bureaucrats 
Before winter ends, this 

town will have been inundated 
by hard-driving young men 
and women who've come 
looking for work and an 
opportunity to save the world . 

By July, many will probably 
find themselves stuffing 
envelopes in office building 
basements. Nevertheless, the 
chance for them to witness 

ecretary of State Alexander 
M . Haig exiting from a 
Georgetown restaurant can be 
too much to forsake. 

Numerou s friend s and 
acquaintances, of course, have 
endured their Washington 
experiences - on congre · 
s i o nal committees, in 
executive departments, or as 
assistants to bureaucratic 
bigwigs - with hardly a 
fli cker of disappointment. Yet 
mo t young staffers never give 
themselves a chance to grow 
old in Washington ; they would 
say that working for the 
government is an education 
more in cynicism than in hope. 

So it wa for 27·year-old 
Brett Fromson, who describes 
his yearlong "education" as a 
White House and congression-
al staff member in his book 
"Running and Fighting: 
Working in Washington." 
While the Stanford University 
graduate notched two better· 
than-average government jobs 
on his resume, his story has 
some universal lessons about 
being young and toiling for the 
bureaucracy. 

Like many fresh· faced s taff 
mem bers, Fromson came here 
(during the last summer of the 
Ford administration) with a 
headiness and aura of self-
importance that would slay 
Ms. America. The author's 
initially elf-congratulatory 
tone is representative of many 
young turk in town. 

Yet it doesn't take long for 

Letter to the Editor 

Fromson to size up the cene. 
Assigned to a top White Hou e 
economics unit, the Connecti-
cut native quickly realizes that 
government policies consist 
more of buzz words than 
s incerity. Fromson learn 
among other things that 
seemingly obvious questions 
about U.S . arms sales rarely 
come up within the national 
security hierarchy. In the 
most powerful office in the 
world, politics renders the 
public interest irrelevan t. 

Admittedly, after several 
months in the executive 
bran c h, the frustrated 
Fromson would have been able 
to write hi book about 
government serv ice. When he 
cha nge job, he learns that 
the system works no better 
elsewhere in town. Even at the 
bipartisan Joint Economic 
Committee of Congress GEC), 
where Fromson immerses 
himself in railroad and Social 
Security issues, sound ideas 
don't always su rvive, 
pertinent questions aren't 
alway asked, let alone 
answered by congressional 
witnesses. 

Fromson eventually resigns 
from the lEC over its 
suppression of his white paper 
on the Social Security tax 
increase, which he believes 
has grave economic implica-
tions. As a result, despite his 
previously long-term expecta-
tion s, Fromson leaves 
Washington no longer a 
neophyte but a disillusioned 
and angry young man , 

"When you work for the 
government, you're there to 
serve the public," From on 
told us recently. "The goals 
are s uppo ed to be totally 
different from those of 
bus iness, where there ' a 
tremendous feeling of servi ng

Pacific News Service 

Effects of the hostages on Iran 
By MANSOUR FARHANG 

Pacific News ervice 
A year has gone by s ince the 

American hostages in Tehran 
were freed. Under ·tandably , 
public interest in the plight of 
the ho tages remains strong, 
but there seems to be little 
curio it y about the conse· 
quences of the event for the 
Iranian people , the \'a t 
majority of whom opposed the 
act from its inception. In fact, 
the Iranian people have proven 
to be the principal victims of 
the event. 

It i by now common 
knowled~e that Ayatollah 
Khomeini s son , Ahmad, and 
his mysterious foreign policy 
lieutenant , Mousavi·Khoeini-
ha, were the principal 
conspi rators behind the initial 
seizure of the Ameri can 
Embassy Nov. 4, 1979. 

Koheiniha wa at the time 
Khomeini 's representative at 
the national radio and 
television net work, which 
played a key role in u ing the 
incident to create public 
hysteria . He also was the 
prayer leader and mentor of 
the militants, and thus the 
principal contact between the 
hostage-taker and Khomeini, 
u s ually through Ahmad . 
Ahmad was the daily source of 
information for his father 
about what was happening 
inside the embassy . 

From the beginning, the 
em ba ssy captors were 
committed unconditionally to 
Khomeini 's wi shes, which 
were con veyed to them 
through Ahmad and Khoeini -
ha. Two days after the seizure, 
Ahmad went to the embassy 
and announced t o the 
militants that "all the Iranian 
nation supports you r move." 

The main objective of the 
conspiracy was to exploit the 
legitimate anti -We tern 
concerns and sent iments of 
the Iranian people by creating 
a massive confrontation with 
the United States . The 
ymbolic importance of the 

act. together with a sign of the 
ayatollah's approval, would 
give the funda mentali st 
conspirators t he una sailable 
prest ige t hey needed to 
suppress t he democrat ic 
aspirations in the revolution· 
ary proce s. 

In ot her words, the hostage· 
taking was the means of a 
ski llful coup d'etat which put 
the fundamentali t in a 
posi tion of absolute power. In 
the immediate aftermath of 
the event, the Bazargan 
Cabinet fell and the 
Revolutionary Council, which 
wa s dominated by the 
fundamentalists, became the 
complete and unchallenged 
ruling body. Khoemini himself 
described the seizure of the 
embassy as "the second 
revolution, which was more 
important than the first 
revolution," meaning the 
revolution that overthrew the 
monarchy on Feb. 11, 1979. 

The success of this coup, 
however, did not mean that 
the Iranian people approved of 
taking the hostages, as Ahmad 
claimed. In the presidential 
election three months after the 
embassy seizure, the two 
candidates who received 95 
percent of the popular votes, 
Bani ·Sadr and Madani, both 
had pu blicly opposed the 
holding of hostages. Yet Bani -
Sadr, who was elected by 75 
percent of the voters, 
remained a prisoner of the 

coup d 'etat until his violent 
ouster. 

At the time of the takeover 
the fundamentali st-dominated 
assembly of experts was 
trying to for mulate a 
theocrat ic/totali tarian cons ti-
tution for the Is lamic 
Republic. Democratic opposi-
tion to t hi s design wa so 
extensive and vocal that even 
Khomeini's support for the 
fundamentalist position had to 
be disguised. 

But in the xenophobic 
propaganda which followed 
the seizure of the embassy the 
critics of t he fundamentalists 
were pressured into silence. 
Consequently, the resulting 
document ga ve ab olute , 
arbitrary and divinely defined 
power to the faqih (religious 
jurist ) and pronounced 
Khomeini faqih for life. Any 
critici m of this provision 
came to constitute evidence 
that a person cou Id be 
anything from misguided to an 
outright CIA agent. Thus the 
fundamentalists managed to 
pass a theocratic/ totalitarian 
constitution in the name of 
Islam within weeks after the 
hostages were seized . 

Many of the events which 
since have plunged Iran into is 
present i so lation and 
desperation stemmed directly 
from the hostage taking. The 
freezing of Iran 's deposits in 
US banks and the impo ition 
of economic sanctions on the 
country destroyed Iran' s 
established trade relations and 
international credit. Conse-
quently, oil exports shrunk, 
and Iran's hard currency 
reserves, which amounted to 
$14 billion at the time, began to 
dry up.

A protest to the clinic closure 
Editor: 

I haveju t returned from my 
quarterly vis i t to the 
contraceptive clinic in the 
Health Center where I was 
adly informed of the shocking 

news that as of Feb. 1, all 
financial support will be cut 
off and theclinicclo ed!Allthe 
familiar, knowledgable and 
friendly women I've gotten to 
know and tru t over the years 
will be fired and general 
nurses will replace them . 
There will be no more "rap 
sessions" on contraceptive 
update, no more abortion and 
pregnancy counseling of any 

kind available on campus! 
Basically, onl y Pap Smears 
and pill prescription refills wi ll 
be attainable. In future years, 
there will be plent y of young 
women needing contracptive 
information ; college is oft en 
the firs t place they encounter 
thi s need for help and ad vice, 
Now, where will they go and 
who will they ask for help? 
Let's hope they don ' t make any 
mis take , for that could mean 
a life (either a los or a gain). 
Better yet, let the clinic stay 
and they won 't be alone with 
their probl ms and any 
chances of mis takes will 

s harpl y decrease. Do the 
Chancellor and resident head 
doctor of the Health Center 
have the nerve and misconcep-
tion to believe that college 
student are "asexual ?" Shall 
we next be fitted for manditory 
chas tity belts? Not only IS this 
a very personal matter, but a 
legal one as well. 

We , the students, have 
prepaid, in September, for the 
continual funding of this 
program through Ju n , It is, as 
I have found out, unlawful to 
cut off the financial resources 
of a University program after 

the allocated budget has been 
fixed (as it has). The UC 
Regents can't repay each 
s tudent their portion of the 
funds; so what. if I may ask, 
will our money be used for, 
especially since our Reg. fees 
were just recently raised? 
Lastly, I don't understand how 
UC San Diego, one of the 
youngest of the UC campuses, 
famous for its ontinuous 

development of sc ience 
research and modern tech-
niques and ju s t recently 
ranked thirteenth acro s the 
nation for higher educational 
excellence, can make such an 
unprogre s ive, almo s t 
Victorian deci ion with the 
future of bot h our registration 
fees and our Health Center.

Iran: the real victim Letters to the Editor 
, ' 1111 1111111.' (( 11'0111 page :! 

The country became so 
isolated that during the entire 
crisis it had to buy food , 
industrial good ,weapons and 
other items on the European 
black market at inflated 
prices. Some import needs 
such as raw materials and 
s pare parts could not be 
purchased even in the black 
market. Consequently, many 
factories were shut down and 
the resulting unemployment 
and shortages cau ed great 
hardship for the populace. It is 
e timated that the economic 
loss to Iran during the hostage 
crisis exceeded $10 billion . 
Since the freezing of the 
country's funds in the United 
States, the Iranian govern· 
ment has been paying an 
average of $500,000 a month to 
the lawyers defending it in 
di putes with US companie . 

The diplomatic i olation of 
Iran and its compounding 
economic problems made the 
country 0 vulnerable that 
Pre ident Saddam Hussein of 
Iraq seized the opportunity to 
strike militarily at what 
appeared to be an easy target. 

The war with Iraq , which was 
a direct outcome ofthe hostage 
crisis, is the most tragic event 
in the modern history of Iran. 
More than a dozen ci tie and 
town s in the oil · rich 
Khuzistan province have been 
devastated. Abadan , wherethe 
largest refinery in t he world 
was located, is completely 
ravaged. Thus, oil production 
was cut even further, by the 
war's destruction and by 
Iran' s inability to find 
customers for its oil. Today 
Iran's hard currency reserves 
have been completely spent 
and the government actually is 
trying borrow money abroad . 

In addition, the war has 
created 2 million refugees from 
the occupied areas. Most of 
t hem are dependen t on the 
central government for their 
ba ic needs. The refugee 
camps are the mos t shocking 
scene of human mi ery the 
Iranian societ y ha s ever 
witnessed , So far , more than 
25 ,000 Iranians have 10 t their 
live in this absurd conflict 
and nearly 60,000 have been 
wounded . It is estimated that 

the material loss from the war, 
including the cost of 
rebuilding the ruin s, exceeds 
$200 billion . 

Short Iy after the taking of 
hostages, the popular Iranian 
writer and sociologist. Dr. Ali -
Asghar Haj·Said -Javadi, in an 
article titled "The Artillery 
That Shoots Lies," likened the 
keeping of hostages to a rope 
around the neck of Iranian 
soc iety . He co urageo u s ly 
argued that the longer the 
crisis continued , the tighter 
the rope would become. He 
warned the aut horities to 
recogni ze the elf·d structive 
nature of the act before the 
rope st rangled the revolution . 
It is hard to think of a more 
appropriat e analogy and a 
more accu rilte pred ict ion . 

Thus, as the Ameri can 
people commemorate the first 
anniversary of the hostages' 
fr ee dom , it would be 
instru ct ive to di vert their 
attention for a moment toward 
the plight of the Iranian 
people, who ha\'e' suffered 
more t han anyone for the 
hostage·taklllg crime. 

Should students 
fund abortions? 
Editor: 

Aborti on is a highly 
controversi al issue for college 
students bot h politically and 
morally. The decision to make 
abortion part of our health 
service and a a con equence 
a mall amount of our 
registration fees, ca nnot 
made solely on the basis of 
majori ty rule. Such an action 
will rai se a great d al of 
opposition from restricted 
side . 

My point, in conjunction 
with this is~ue, i. that the 

deCl'>lOn over where to draw 
the line on benefits sponsored 
by student fund~ .,hould not be 
made without great care and 
consideration. If students , 
who are against abort lon, 
shou Id not be required to pay 
for student abortions out of 
their reg fees, then what 
about student · who do not 
believe III the Chnstlan faith 

hould they be required to aid

While many young Ameri-

and state capitals may see 
themselve in Fromson, few of 
his contemporaries will feel 
sorry for him. Such is every 
generation 's tendency with its 
more ambitiou member , 
Unfortunately, many college

Jealous ie aside, however , 
we ca n ' t ignore h ow 
government service can 
destroy those of even the best 
intentions. Too many bright 
and energetic American, it 
seems, plainly give up and 
return to the private sector, 
leav ing others who don' t mind 
politician and fostering their 
continuing compromises. 

As From son co ncludes, 
" You can't keep turning off 
young people too long and 
expect them to be attracted to 
pu blic service. Eventually all 
you 're going to end up with are 
shill and naked careerists ." 

Of course, one need not have 
worked in Washington to 
understand that, like lobbyi sts 

and would -be pres ident s, 
you ng idealists will continue 
to venture to this bottomland 
to be "educated ." It would be 
folly to expect this cy nical 
cycle to change overnight. 

While Fromson offers no 
s ugges tion s for change , 
however , his book goes a long 
way in profiling for young and 
old the limi tations of working 
in Washington. Unle s tho e 
bound for "The Company" 
master From on' s lesson and 
under tand the inherent 
obstacles, many will end up 
like our crusader: burned out 
and turned off to public 
service. 

Each year, we pay dearly for 
such a high attrition rate.

experience that a social norm

Walkers 
Editor: 

I would like to comment on 
pedestrians. Normally I have 
nothing against them, and 
often is the time I enjoy 
walking myself. but recently I 
have noticed a change in many 
of them. 

I will be peacefully riding 
my bike, and someone will 
start in front of me. Now a 
pedestrian is much more agile 
than a bike, so this often 
results in my ending up on the 
concrete with the bike on top. 
Now I can understand, and 
even forgive this act, because 
there has always been a feud 
between bikers and pedestri· 
ans, but more and more often it 
is showing up between 
pooestrians themselves. 

I have almost even been 
goaded into a fight due to 
another person running me off 
the walkway and then trying 
to place the blame on me. 
Perhaps all pedestrians should 
look on them elves as people 
and learn to live with others a 
well as themselves. It would 
make the campus much easier 
to live on .

Suspect in fall quarter 
bomb threat arraigned 

A trial date has been set 
for a Warren College 
sophomore who was 
arrested last December for 
reporting a bomb threat 
during a biology final in 
lohn Muir Theater. 

At a trial set fot today, the 
woman will face possible 
felony charges of "trans-
mitting a bomb threat." 

UCSD Police arrested the 
suspect Dec. 9 after her 
name was singled out from 
a list of students who did 
not show up to take the 8 
a .m. final for the biology 
class. 

Before the bomb threat 
had even been telephoned in 
by the suspect, David 
Woodruff, the professor for 
Biology 20, had inspected 

the classroom for any 
explosive devices which 
might have been planted 
there. 

Woodruff ' foun~ nothing 
resembling a bomb, which 
led police to believe that the 
suspect: had not placed a 
bomb in the classroom, but 
was only threatening. 

With the permission of 
the UCSD Police, Woodruff 
resumed his exam. From a 
list of students not present 
at the exam, UCSD Police 
singled out the suspect. 

The suspect was unwill · 
ing to comment on the case 
until it is resolved. 

The case will be heard a 
1:15 p.m. today in the 
downtown municipal 
courthouse. 

Health Center phases out 
some counseling services 

By PAUL FARWELL 
Associate News Editor 

Officials at the Student 
Health Center announced 
Tuesday that the Contracep-
tive and Health Education 
Clinic - a counseling and 
information ervice which 
advises students in such 
matters as venereal di ea e, 
pregnancy, and abortion -
will be eliminated, and that its 
services will be absorbed by a 
recently enlarged staff of 
nurse practitioners. 

And with the elimination of 
the clinic has come the outrage 
of staff members in the Health 
Center. 

"Education is a big part of 
the clinic ," commented a 
source inside the Health 
Center who preferred to 
remain anonymou . "And 
there will be no education at all 
(now that the clinic has been 
eliminated). " 

"Somebody who wants to 
come in to receive birth control 
pills will be able to do 0 under 
a nurse practitioner. And 
that's not what we call 
counseling or education ." 

'More professional' 
In past years, work·study 

student and peer group 
advisors have cons tituted the 
bulk of the clinic's work force. 
But under the new program, 
counseling services will be 
provided by regi stered nurses 
instead of part time or 
volunteer workers. 

"We wanted to improve the 
service by making it a bit more 
professional ," Robert Allen, 
Director of the Health Center, 
commented. " I have nothing 
again t having student peer 
group also providing help, but 
I want to be ure that we're 
offering every patient the 
opportunity to ee a trained 
profe sional. 

"Because we've had ome 
problems in the pas t with 
student getting appoint -
ments, we 're going to have at 
least three and perhap fi ve 
nurse practitioners available 
for tudent ," Allen said . 

"And al so," A lien saId , 
" we ' re g o ing t o trea t 
contraceptive coun eling in a 
more confidential way. The 
way it work now, wit h a 

s ep rate gr ouping (o f 
counselors), is that if a woman 
comes in for contraceptive 
counseling, it 's obviou what 
she 's coming in for. " 

A burden 
However, a souce inside the 

Health Center commented 
that the reorgamzat ion of 
counseling service will onlv 
become a burden on a staff of 
nurse practItioner . 
"I know for a fact that there 
are nurse practitioners here 
who are not goi ng to be 
co mfort able doing pro blem 
pregnancy (abort ion informat· 
ion) counseling," the source 
srud . 

"Forly·flve mmutes to and 
hour is at lea. t what you need 
for that. And the students are 
going to s uffer becau e they 
are going to have to wait for an 
appointment ," he said. 

taff member of the Health 
Center ha ve also pecula ted 
that some patient might be

La Jolla Farms residents, chancellor meet 
BY MICHAEL AHN 

Slatt Writer 
Officials of UCSD and the 

Sickels O'Brien development 
group met with members of 
the La Jolla community last 
night, and Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson was on hand to hear 
comments from the groups 
regarding the building of a 
research and development 
center on the La Jolla Farms 
property. 

Approximately 60 residents 
attended the meeting, 
providing comments and 
Questions. Atkinson remained 
silent for most of the meeting, 
saying that his role there "is 
only as a moderator and a 

listener. " 
Among some of the 

comments from the home· 
owners were: 

" Is a $200 thousand 
townhouse responsive to the 
needs of the students? I'd like 
to see the student who can 
afford that. " 

A UCSD official replied that 
some of the revinue generated 
by the townhomes would go 
toward stu dent housing 
projects elsewhere. 

Recommendations were also 
made by the homeowners, 
including a proposal to 
withdraw the plan because of a 
possible violation of zoning 
laws. Paul Peterson, attorney 

~'C.ove ~alle"IJ. 
lftO'C.e 

SQUADRON KITES 

for Sickles O'Brien, said that 
"La Jolla community planning 
mayor may not be wrong in its 
zoning law. But they must be 
responsive to changes, ther. 
must be in touch with reality. ' 

Dr. Murray Goodman, a 
resident of the Farms, felt that 
the university was forced into 
accepting the present proposal 
because it was the only one 
submitted out of 90 requests 
for proposals. 

"A single choice is no choice, 
even if it is subject to 
modification. It is not right 
that the university only work 
with one proposal. We should 
have competitive bids," said 
Goodman. 

"I sense that we have taken 
the easy way. One bid 'hould 
be an alarm: what 's wrong 
with thi ? If we can't agree on 
this, I really fear a long term 
hostility between the 
university and the surround· 
ing community," Goodman 
said. 

Development officials 
responded that many firms did 
not take up the bId request 
because of "hard economic 
times." 

Responding to the question 
of selling the property as 
opposed to leasing it, Atkinson 
felt that "there are lots of 
merits to selling the land. 

Personally, I was for sell ing it. 
But the Regent felt that they 
could maximize their profi t 
by leasing." 

At one point a homeowner 
called the building of a 
research center "immoral". 
Atkinson re ponded with , 
"your concept of morallity 
differs from mine." 

In clo ing , Atkin s on 
adressed the homeowners : 

"I know that some people 
believe that I have already 
made up my mind , or that I am 
in secret negotiation with the 
developers, but I'm not, and J 
appreciate all the input that I 
ha ve recei ved . "

Josh McDowell~ why 
life is so special 

BY LYNETTE TOM 
The man that stood on the 

platform in front of the Revelle 
Cafeteria was of average 
height. His light red hair was 
at a moderate length and his 
gray eyes s urveyed the 
audience with a steady gaze. 
Hi dress was an odd, yet 
complementary combination 
of Western (plaId shirt,leather 
vest, and corduroy jean ) and 
Preppy (topsiders) influences. 
And while most of the people 
sitting in the room probably 
couldn't recognize him on 
ight, they could certainly do 

so with the mention of hi 
name: Josh McDowell. 

Funny, he doesn't look like 
someone who could cau e such 
a ruckus on campu , at least 
not along the scales of Brother 
Jed's early appearance on 
Revelle Plaza two weeks 
before. Alt hough McDowell 
has never crossed paths with 
thr evangelist, he does know of 
him and welcomes the 
opportunity of meeting him. 

"I think maybe I would do a 
few things differently," he 
said. 

One of those few things was 
his approach to speaking 
before the UCSD audience. His 
Wednesday evening lecture 
was on "The Great Resurrec· 
tion Hoax ," but no one 
could've ever guessed it from 
listening to t he first five 
minutes -which could best be 
described as a comedy routine. 
Like McDowell's recollection 
of a zoology exam he took as a 
college freshman . Outraged 

over ,his professor 's request to 
identify the type of bird , its 
local environment, and eating 
habits just by its legs, he 
walked up to the front of the 
auditorium, s lammed the 
exam on the table and started 
to storm out of the room . 

"The professor said to me, 
'Ju t a minute, young man. 
What's your name? ' recalled 
McDowell. HI pulled up my 
pant I~~ and said, 'Here, you 
guess! " 

Later, when the audience 
broke up over hi quip, " It's so 
hard that every time I speak at 
State (SDSU), I have to speak 
in one syllable words," he shot 
back with " I don't know what 
you're laughing about. I 
probably said the same thing 
about you when I was over 
there. " 

"I'm not a preacher ," 
admitted McDowell. ' 'I'm not 
an evangelist. I think it would 
be fair to say I ' m a 
communicator and an 
entertainer. Nothing wrong 
about entertaining people 
while you're communicatin~. 
It' s one of the best ways to.' 

Not everything that 
McDowell communicates is of 
a lighthearted nature, as 
illustrated by his comparison 
between Chri tianity and 
other faith s. 

"Chri stianity is pretty 
much diametrically opposite of 
your other major religions," he 
explained. "Almost all your 
other major religions are based 
upon a philosophical proposi· 

tion or a theologic idealogy, 
something that you adhere to 
or believe in. Christianity is 
based upon the identity of its 
founder and the event within 
time, space, dimension , 
history , the Resurrection . 

That is why if you want to 
refute Christianity, it's best to 
commence your study in a 
history class, not a philosophy 
class, because its basis for the 
most part is historical. even 
though it has tremendous 

ph i1osophical overtones."

the factors behind the

Library cutbacks Speakers discuss implications of proposed Family Protection Act 
By SCOTT YOUNG 

By JANE KOHLBUSH 
In what was emphasized 

as the "culmination of over 
a year's discussion" 
Beverlee French, Head 
Librarian at the Science and 
Engineering Library 
revealed plans Tuesday 
evening to "definitely 
eliminate the soft materials 
in the library's reserve 
system ... starting as soon as 
Spring of this year." 

Soft materials consist 
almost entirely of problem 
set and exam solutions used 
mostly by students in the 
science courses on campus. 

Figures for Fall, 1980 
indicate that soft materials 
comprise much of the 
library's reserve holdings, 
and, as French pointed out, 
"the traffic and activity 

around these holdings is the 
major contributing factor to 
cramped spaces, noise and 
long lines at the copy 
machines." 

S& E will lead the way in 
the cutbacks, eliminating 
its soft materials this 
spring, while Biomed and 
Cluster will follow next fall , 
Central library remains 
relatively unaffected, since 
it does not handle much of 
the non·library material. 

Anything copyrighted, 
such as books and articles 
will remain in the library 's 
reserves. 

French said she "would 
like to emphasize that the 
library has felt for a long 
time that t~e system is not

"The Family Protection Act 
is a racist , sexist, bigoted, 
piece of material that was

to Kathy Martin . who spoke at 
the first Repre sive Legi la· 
tion " Teach·In", Monda y 
night in the North Conference 
Room . 

Martin, representing 
Ameri can For Ju tice, 
focused on the F.P.A. as one of 
the primary "repressive" 
pieces of legislation being 
proposed this decade.

One of the aspects of the 
Family Protection Act (which 
is currently pending in 
Congres) i that no 
educational fund would be 
authorized for educational 
material or studies if they 
tended to "denigrate, 
diminish, or deny the role 
differences between the sexes 
as they have been under tood 
in the United States." 

Martin believs that Moral 
Majority leader Jerry Falwell 
shows "very little difference

Act and the platforms of the 
Moral Majority."

parents are notified first. Not 
only that , in the case of VD the 
parent have to be notified in 
writing within 24 hours before 
treatment can begin on a 
young per on with VD." 

"Now I'm an ex· teacher, " 
continued Martin, "and I can 
tell you one thing - kids that 
aren't afraid of their parent 
will go to their parents 
anyway. Theones that come to 
these clinics, who need thi 
help, in tead of having a self-
abortion with a coathanger 
back in the alley, depend upon 
that confidentlality or they 
would not use those sevices. So 
this isn't going to olve 
anything. " 

Speaking on the constitu· 
tionality of the FPA was Ted 
Burner of the National lawyers 
Guild, Bumer saw the FPA as 

an abolishment of many of the 
human rights constitutional-
ized in the pa t 50 years. 

"Really, ] lived under Nazi 
Germany in 1937, just before 
the war, and the parallels here 
regarding the men as the 
soldiers and the women as the 
people that are egregated and 
off by the side (a ) the 
supporters and above all the 
chlld·bearers (are apparent)," 
said Burner referring to a 
repres ive aspect of the FPA. 

The ASUCSD sponsored the 
teach-in. Pam Gerber, 
commis ioner of External 
Affairs, said "The Family 
Protection Act clearly has a 
direct effect on many aspect 
of student life, but for the most 
part they deal with legalitie 
on the private life of the 
individual not nece arily 
correlated with being a 
tudent. "

UCSD Mt. Everest team returns 
First medical research group to scale mountain calls trip outstanding success 

Members of the fir s t 
expedition ever to climb 
Mount Everest strict Iy to 
conduct medical research 
returned to the United States 
last month , and the UCSD 
School of Medicine professor 
who led the expedition has 
pronou nced t he effort an 
"outstanding success." 

Most of t he cientific 
measurements the team set 
out to record were taken, and 
three American members of 
the expedi tion, along with two 
Sherpas, reached the su mmit 
of t he world's ta ll est 
mountain. 

John West, M.D., Ph.D., 
leader and science director of 
the Am e ri ca n Med ica l 
Research Expedition to Mount 
Everest, said that although the 
severe weather conditions 
t hey encoun tere d were 
discouraging at first, the 
expedition accomplished more 
than he had hoped. 

" We set out with a very 
ambitious plan , and at one 
point, I thought our chances of 
getting measurements on the 
ummit were quite low," said 

West, a pu Imonary phy iolo-
gi t and profes or of medicine 
at the UCSD School of 
Medicine. "After all, there are 
many expeditions which fail to 
get anybody on the summit at 
all, and t hat is their ole 
purpo e. 

"Not only did we get most of 
the data we set out to collect, 
and succes fully reach the 
summit, but we accomplished 
all of thi with only a few 
minor injuries, like crushed 
toes and infected leech bites," 
he aid. "We also had three 
cases of pulmonary edma, or 
fluid in the lung, which is 
unusual, but considering that 

12 people died t his past 
autumn in Nepalese expedi-
tions, I think we were quite 
fortunate." 

The 21 -member expedition 
was headed by West; John 
Evans, of Denver, Colorado. 
deputy leader in charge of 
climbing; and F. Duane Blume. 
Ph.D .. of Baker field, 
California, deputy leader in 
charge of logist ic and finance. 
The team consisted of a base 
camp manager, six climber 
and 14 medical doctors and 
scientists, half of whom were 
also experienced climbers. 
Ironica ll y, of th e three 
Americans who made it to the 
top, two were medical doctors. 

The expedition left 
Kathmandu , the capital of 
Nepal , on August 6, with the 
intention o f co ndu cting 
extensive medical re earch at 
various alt itudes on Moun t 
Everest, and ultimately to take 
measurements of heart and 
lung performance on the 
summit of t he mountain, 
whirh "tands at 29,028 feet. 

The purpose of the 
expedition was to study the 
response of t he heart and 
lungs to a low -oxygen 
environment. Because of its 
altitude, Mount Everest 
presents an environment with 
the lowest oxygen levels that 
man is known to tolerate. The 
environment there simulates 
the conditions of patient who 
have chronic heart and lung 
di ease which reduce the 
level of oxygen in their blood. 

By exposing healthy 
subjects to extremely low 
oxygen levels for an extended 
period of time, expedition 
scientists hoped to study how 
the body adapts to oxygen 
deprivation and learns to

tolerate reduced oxygen levels. 
Although the expedition 

depart ed on schedule, a 
shortage of Sherpa porters and 
some terrible storms delayed 
progress at certain points. 
Base Camp was established at 
17,700 feet on Augu t 30. A 
route wa quickly found 
through the treacherous 
Khumbu Ice Fall , a huge 
glacier that had to be traversed 
in order to establi h the main 
laboratory camp at 20,500 feet. 
However, because of a storm, 
progress was halted for almost 
a week. The laboratory camp, 
aLa called Camp H, was set up 
by the end of September, and 
re earch began in early 
October. 

"One of our big problems 
was getting the tremendou 
load of scientific equipment up 
to Camp H," explained West. 
"Our trip was logistically 
unique in that nobody before 
has tried to put such an 
enormous amount of equip-
ment high on the mountain. 
We had all available Sherpa 
porters carrying about a ton of 
equipment through the ice 
fall. ' 

In the meantime, other 
members of the expedition 
were establishing smaller 
camp at higher level on the 
mountain. They selected a 
difficult route up the south 
pillar of Everest which had 
only been used once before. 
Camp II! was e tabli hed 
entirely on platforms. ince 
the snow was so steep. Camp 
V, the final camp below the 
summit , wa e tabli hed at 
26.400 feet on October 11 . 

Gale force wind at the end 
of September not only delayed 
the climbers working their 
way up the mountain , but also

damaged tents at the lower 
laborat ory camp, and 
according to West , claimed at 
least four lives on other 
mountaineering expeditIOns III 
Nepal. West, who remained in 
the laboratory camp but kept 
in touch with the clImber.;; via 
radIO, said he had gwen up 
hope that anyone would make 
it to the <;ummit. 

But on October 2. climber 
Chris KopczynskI of Spokane, 
Washington. and t he Sherpa 
Sondare set out for the 
summit. They found wind 
conditions Ie. s severe after 
they left Camp V, but the 
winds became fierce once 
again beyond a point called the 
South Summit. Nonethele s, 
they reached the peak in only 
four hours and 23 minute . 
Unfortunately, due to poor 
radio communication. Kopczy· 
nski could not fInd the 
scientific equipment at Camp 
V and so was not able to take 
any scientific mea urements 
on his a cent. 

On the day of the fir t 
ucce sful a . ault. Chri~ Pizzo 

of San Diego, Call for III a , and 
Peter Hackett of Anchorage. 
Alaska, th medical doctors. 
headed for Camp V to recover 
the scientific equipment. 
Because of the improved 
weather conditions w hen the} 
arrived , Pizzo prepared the 
research instruments and, on 
October 24. decided to ascend 
the mountain . He and the 

herpa Young· Tensing 
reached the peak, carried out a 
se ries of phYSiological 
measurements and measured 
the barometric pre ure at the 
urn mit. The two spent about 

a half hour on the summit and 
launched a Fri bee into Tibet 
before they left . 

That morning, after Pizzo 
and Young·Tensing departed 
for the summit. Hackett and 
another Sherpaet off for a 
short climb. The Sherpa 
returned to camp after less 
than an hour of climbing, but 
Hackett continued to v-.-alk , 
since the weather \1, as good 
and the view spectacular. At 
about 2 p.m .. he met Pizzo and 
Young·Tensmg coming down 
the mountain , and after 
conSIdering t he conditions and 
the 11m , he deCIded to make 
the climb alone. He reached 
the . ummlt at 3:30 p.m. He 
caught up with Pizzo. who had 
waited for hIm, at about 5:30 
p.m.. and they returned to 
Camp V at 8 p.m. 

Kopczyn ki, PIZZO and 
Hackett were the mnth, tenth, 
and eleventh Americans to 
reach the sum mit of Mount 
Evere t. 

The ascents were marked by 
good fortune. When Pizzo 
began hi climb, hewas unable 
to find hI ice axe at Camp V 
and grabbed a tent pole to 31d 
in his ascent. Luckily, after 
c1imbmg several hundred feet. 
he found an Ice axe left b\ a 
previous expedItIon, a "m ill;on 
to one chance." according to 
West. 

Hacket t had a close ca 11 on 
his descent. when he lipped. 
iell and found hImself 
danglIng upSIde down, his foot 
caught on a rock. A fixed rope 
left by an earher expedition 
helped him to ext ricate 
himself and cont1l1ue hiS climb 
down . 

The clImber all came 
across the ice·encased body of 
a climber who had died of 
exposure dUTlng a 1979

Everest expedition provides data 
Experience yields much scientific data 

4.: 0111I1H1( '(I (. ,,1. 
While the uccessful 

ascents were taking place, 
research programs were being 
carried out at the lower camps. 
At Base Camp, the ventilation 
of expedition members and 
Sherpa wa measured both 
during sleep and awake 
periods. Though the Sherpa 
did not 'how any marked 
change in breathing patterns 
when they were asleep, 
researchers found that the 
members of the expedition 
experienced erratic breathing 
patterns during leep. Blood 
samples were also taken at 
this level. 

At the laboratory camp, 
extensive maximal exercise 
tests were conducted. West 
found that the s ubject s 
managed higher levels of work 
than subjects did in similar 
tests 20 years ago, when West 
accompanied Sir Edmund 
Hillary on a Himalayan 
expedition and did some high· 
altitude research. 

"I think this improvement 

was partly due to the fact that 
peop le's anit udes about 
fitness have changed in the 
past 20 years," West 
speculated. "We had a very 
keen group of exercisers, 
marathon runners, and so 
forth, on this expedition." 

They also conducted 
metabolic studies, measured 
intestinal absorption, took 
blood samples, and carried out 
sleep studies. 

At Camp V. blood samples 
were obtained, and continuous 
electrocardiograms were 
recorded during sleep by Pizzo, 
Hackett and Kopczynski . On 
the summit. continuous 
electrocardiograms were 
obtained during the climb by 
Hackett and Pizzo, alveolar 
gas samples were collected by 
Pizzo, and Pizzo also measured 
ventilation both on the way up 
and on the way down. The 
expedition was terminated at 
the end of October, and 
expedition members returned 
to the United States in 
November. 

Now t hat West has ret urned 
to his laboratory at UCSD, he 
ha everal months of work 
ahead of him. Blood anc 
alveolar gas samples were: 
brought back for clo e 
analysis, and all of the data 
mu t be sorted through and 
tudied, 
The expedition was 

sponsored by the American 
Alpine Club. the American 
Physiological Society, and the 
Explorers Club. Major grants 
were given by the American 
Lung As s ociation; the 
National Geographic Society; 
the National Heart, Lung and 
Blood Institute; Servier 
Laboratories in Paris; the 
National Science Foundation 
and the U.S . Army Medical 
Research and Development 
Command. In addition , 
numerous cash donations 
were made by individuals and 
organizations, and medical 
supplies, scientific equipment, 
climbing equipment, clothing 
and food were contributed by a 
number of sources.

TVI5. Salk discusses with 
Callaway the "religion" of 
nature , a philosophy he 
believes holds the keys to 
mankind's survival. "We have 
the capacity to do for ourselves 
what we pray to God for," ays 
the scientist/philo opher. 

After he became an 
international celebrity in the 
1950s, Salk founded the Salk 
Institute in La Jolla for the 

study of cancer, alcoholism , 
behavior, and language. It is 
here that Callaway visits him 
for this interview about his 
work and ideas. They talk 
about a "global society" where 
nations replace competition 
with cooperation and 
materialism with spiritual· 
ism, Dr. Salk expresses his 
view that human society 
conscious ly adapts to change 
as does the rest of the animal 
kingdom. When faced with 
en ergy s hort age s and 
overpopulation. people adapt 
by exploring alternative 

energy resources and 
practicing birth control. 

In his informal talk with 
Callaway. Salk refutes I he 
idea of a God that is like a 
super·human, "God wa s 
invented out of a need for 
order," he says, and he finds 
t he concepts of "God" and 
"order" the same,

New bill on rent control laws 
falls before the Assembly 

By HENRY SCHULMAN 
Sacramento Correspondent 

SACRAMENTO . In 
Assembly member Tom Bates' 
Berkeley district, there exists 
one of t he most stringent rent 
control laws in the country. 
Rents can only be raised once a 
year, and only to the amount 
allowed by a nine·member rent 
board. 

A lesser·known part of the 
rent law is the "just cau e for 
eviction " ordinance. These 
guidelines allow landlords to 
evict tenants only in cases of 
tenant abuse, or if the landlord 
or part of his family wants to 
move into the apartment. 

Berkeley voters overwhelm· 
ingly approved "just cause" in 
1980. But as the saying goe , 
Berkeley might be ready for 
the world; the world , however, 
is not ready for Berkeley. 

Bates , a political ally of the 
political organization in 
Berkeley which presented rent 
control to the voters, brought 
the "just cause" proposal to 
Sacramento. where he wanted 
the State Legislature to 
approve it for all of California. 

But his bill, AB 623, never 
made it to the Assembly floor. 
After hearing testimony from 
several tenants who claimed 
they were unfairly evicted. the 
Assembly Judiciary Commit· 
tee last week fell two vote 
short of approving it, 5·5. 

The measure would have 
allowed evictions only under 
these circumstances: 

- tenant conduct that 
dis turb other tenant · and 
neighbors. 

- reckless or negligent 
commission of substantial 
damage. 

- violation of reasonable 
rules set by the landlord. 

- violation of health codes. 
- failure to pay rent. 
- remodelmg without the 

landlord's permission. 
- several additional 

technical reasons. 
Current law allows 

landlords to evict tenants 
without leases by simply 
giving the tenant 30 days 
written notice. The proposed 
legislation was designed to 
protect tenants ' rights, Bates 
said. which brought the 
opposition of the property 
owners' industry, 

With the same fervor that 
tenants have supported the 
proposal, real estate lobbyists 
opposed it 

Dugald Gillies , vice 
president of Governmental 
Relations for the powerful 
California Association of 
Realtors, said "ju t cause" 
would ultimately hurt tenants 
with increased rents . 

He said, "Landlords would 
be in court more often, There 
wou Id be costs of litigation and 
delays encountered in 
recovering possession of 
property. It is the widespread 
experience of landlords that 
once eviclion proceedings are 
initiated, the tenant stops 
paying rent. 

"The bi ll would most 
certainly lengthen the period 
landlords are not getting rent, 
and the cost of vacancy must 
be passed onto the tenants." 

Gillies offered an example: a 
family with a young bully 
moves into an apartment 
building. Tenants claim that 
the kid is beating up other in 
the building and demand an 
eviction, 

Under AB 623 the landlord 
could legally evict the bully's 
fami ly. But the burden of proof 
would be on the landlord to 
show the just cause, requiring 
witne ses and increased time 
spent on preparing a case, 
Gillies said. 

Opposition to "just cause" 
centers around the contention 
that good tenants would have, 
in effect, a lifetime lea e since 
they cannot be removed for 
reasons other than bad 
behavior. 

But the California Housing 
Action Information Net work 
(CHAIN), a Sacramento· based 
tenants group, contends "just 
cause" is necessary to prevent 
retaliatory evictions - getting 
back at tenants for complaints 
or court actions - and 
astronomical rent raises 
designed to force tenants out. 

A CHAIN newsletter 
relXlrted that "approximately 
12,000 evictions take place 
each year in California, by 
court order, based on 30-day' 
notices with no causestated. lt 
is impossible to tell how many 
of these would be outlawed by 
pa sage of "just cause." 

CHAIN challenges the 
notion that court loads wou ld 
increase: "The primary value 
of the "just ause" law is in

Al Di Meola's perfortnance is disappointing 
BY TIM AUGUST 

Tue day night's sold out concert at the Fox 
Theatre with AI Di Meola was a surprising 
disappointment. It looked so good on paper. The 
band's lineup included some of the best in the 
business with Jan Hammer on synthesizer/ 
keyboards, Mingo Lewis on assorted percussion. 
Anthony Jackson on the bass, and drummer Steve 
Gadd. But when a concert with the likes of these 
performers doesn 't come off well something is 
definitelv wron~. _ 

A possible reason for the failure could have been ir. 
the sound system. The mix was so poor at times that 
it was difficult to distinguish the instruments from 
each other and at other times it was too muddy to 
distinguish anything from the noise that emanated 
from the sound system. Numerous technical 
difficulties also plagued the guitar and bass 
equipment and caused quite a few delays in the 
performance. 

. Maybe the problem lied in that the evening's 
performance was being recorded for a possible live 
album, which tended to make the fan s more unruly 
than those at a typical concert. In addition to the over 
exuberant crowd, a photographer was taking 
pictures (presumably for the album), 0 the band 
members often felt obliged to strike a pretentious 
pose for the photographer, interruptin~ the 
continuity of the performance with the ludIcrous 
antics of the performers - most notably Di Meola 
and Hammer. 

Or it could have been the music itself that 
contributed to the poor quality of the concert. When 
you could hear it , the latin influenced fusion/ rock 
style Di Meola has adopted simply left much to be 
desiral. Like his albums, Di Meola's live material 
didn't amount to much more than musical 
pyrotechnics - short lived instrumental displays 
that are like firecrackers : after they have exploded 
there's nothing lett to enjoy. 

As mUSIcians the band displayed conSIderable 
talent; leaving no doubt in my mind that the~' are 
among the best anywhere but as a band they didn't 
quite mold into a solid unit. 

Steve Gadd provided a good. olid backbone for the 
group with hi , powerful drumming. Anthony 
Jackson's style on bass proved him to be extremel, 
competent without being flashy . Veteran 
percu, sioni, t Mingo Lewi. filled out the rhyt hm 
section and was the most animated of all the 
performers, turning in a visually a well a. aurally 
exciting set. Jan Hammer was his usual self - just 
one never·ending high·speed solo after another that 
after awhile sounded the same for every song. Di 
Meola seemed to concentrate more on haking his 
pelvis than attempting anything interestmg with 
his guitar. For most of the evening his guitar didn 't 
rise above the din of the mix; but at least he looked 
good .

Danias is 
superb as 
Pavlova 

BY DON SEQ 
World renown ballerina, 

Starr Danias was radiant in 
concert at Mandeville in her 
recent performance of "The 
Pavlova Celebration ." The 
show was a tribute to Anna 
Pavlova's centennial birthday 
and her contribution to the art 
of ballet. 

Kim berlee Raine and 
Kathleen Smith joined to 
produce a charming little piece 
to keep the energy flowing on 
stage. Then Clark Tippet , 
Alii on Burrow and Gregory 
King entertained the audience 
with a parody on vanity . 
Danias then returned to 
reaffirm the fact , she is a sight 
to behold. With her dexterity 
and beauty, he imply 
beguiled the audience. 

The evening culminated 
with Danias, King Tippet, and 
Carol Mes ner immersed in 
Gi elle (Act 2). This 
con olidated the elements of 
ballet which make it such a 
sensual delight. It contained 
the deep emotions aroused by 
love, the conflict in quest for 
that love, and the climax oft he 
lr)Vers as one_ 

The performance wa one 
fall hort of perfection. In the 
opening number, one of the 
choru s dancer fell and 
aroused questions to the rest 
of the performance. But , any 
doubt was proven unwarran-
ted as the show wa. a 
gratifying and memorable 
experience.

Rock around town 
Armatrading, Blasters and more 

BY ANDREW KE ELER 
Art. Editor 

T here seems to be an attitude arou nd that J oan 
Annatrading is the best un heard of singer today . This opinion 
was recen tly expressed in both the New York and Los Ange les 
Times. If bot h these metropolitan newspapers are talking about 
her she must be doing something right. Armatrading will shed 
light on this mystery when she performs Friday night at 
Montezuma Hall at SDSU. 

Armatrading's new album Walk U11der Ladders has appeared 
on many "best of 81" lists but has received little air play . Born in 
the West Indies, and brou~ht up in England, she has developed a 
unique jazz/ rock tyle whIch has been refined over the course of 
seven albums. 

If Armatrading' record company, A&M, has anything to do 
with it she will be selling albums by the bushels. They have 
launched a massive publicity campaign from record stores to 
radio stations. Her 8 p.m. performance here should at least 
identify th~ face ~ith the ~oice and possibly an end to obscurity. 

Another band dest ined for the big time will be in town Friday 
night at the Belly-Up Tavern in Solana Beach. The Blasters 
have struggled to conquer the L.A. market and now have their 
sights set on the whole ball of wax. 

The last time these rockabilly boys were in San Diego they 
were greeted with boos, but now they have found their audience . 
The 50s style that is The BIas ter has not been easily accepted. It 
took determination to keep going in virtual anonymity while 
other locals X and the Go-Gos were the talk of the country. 

The Blasters feature a set of short, compact, to the gut kind of 
songs as opposed to the long, drawn out work of many of their 
contemporaries. This should be an evening of "real" rock and 
roll and should not be missed. It can be yours for a $5 donation. 
The show starts- at 9 p.m. 

James Hrown is one artist who has not had any publicity 
problems. "The Godfather of Soul" will be in town for two shows 
on Monday night at the Rodeo in LaJolla. Brother James has been 
a fixture on the soul/gospel scene for as long as one can 
remember, and will probably be around forever. 

The eleven·piece James Brown Revue will accompany the star. 
The opening act is local boys, the Spud Brothers. Concerts are 
at 7:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. 

The Bing Crosby Hall at the Del Mar Fairgrounds is the site 
for this weekend's four·band, 40-keg bash featuring The 
Penetrators, The Snails and two other local groups . Tickets 
for this "concert" are $5 and available at Licorice Pizza.

Kenny Rogers rolls 
in lnusic awards 

Kenny Rogers was the big winner in this week's ninth annual 
American Music Awards. Rogers, who has gained enourmous 
popularity in the past few years, was voted favorite pop-rock 
male vocalist and his "Greatest Hits" album scooped both the 
country and pop-rock categories as favorite album. 

In another expected outcome, the combination of Diana Ross 
and Lionel Richie won best song for their version of "Endless 
Love." A survey of 30,000 record buyers accounts for the basis of 
the e awards . 

One surprise was the late John Lennon' name being left off 
the list of winners. Nominated for best male s inger and best 
album, the former Beatie came up short. 

Pat Benatar headed up the list of favorite female vocalists . 
Barbara Mandrell won in the country category and Stephanie 
Mills claimed the soul title. Willie Nelson received the award for 
best male country si nger and Stevie Wonder for soul. Wonder 
was also given a special life achievement award. 

The Australian rock group Air Supply was a surprise winner 
in the favorite pop-rock category. Kool and the Gang, of Schlitz 
Malt Liquor fame, were elected best soul group and the Oak 
Ridge Boys won the same award for country music. 

The heavy·duty awards will be presented February 24 in Los 
Angeles, when we find out who really deserves what when the 
Grammy Awards are handed out.

the Elegant Gypsy album . 
"Flight Over Rio" featured a 
guitar/synthesizer duel and a 
well executed percussion solo, 
which amounted to the 
highest energy level of the 
ent ire set. The hard·driving 
"Race With the Devil on 
Spanish Highway" drew a 
standing ovation from the 
crowd and seemed to be the 

mo t well received song of the 
evening. 

All in all t he audience was 
pleased with the performance 
but didn't manage to get more 
than one obligatory encore out 
of the band. 

The opening act was the Jan 
Hammer group (oddly enough) 
and the trio turned in a far

group opened up their set with

Hammer 's polyphonic 
synthesizer set up was quite 
impressive. He conjured up an

very good, at least knowing 
that it didn't come from a steel 
guitar. A Bach flavored pipe-

__________ .---! •• p_r-,esents Intramural Sports Shorts 
We u sually sta rt off an 

Intramural report by talking about 
an unlikely placekicker like Ray 
Wersching, but why not. This is 
1982. A year for crazies anyhow. 
The Chinese call it the Year of the 
Dog. Let's hope it's better than that. 
I mean after all, it's only January , 
and we've got a long way to go. No 
sense in throwing in the towel too 
soon. 

Just because Ray Wersching 
bored Charger fans to tears last 
Sunday with his four chip shot field 
goals, there's no reason to think that 
'82 is going to be a total bust. After 
all, you have to look at the bright 
spot. Wersching's field goals 
signified the last football game of 
the year and for basketball 
enthusiasts at UCSD it couldn't 
have come too soon. 

I mean really. If you want to spend 
time talking about field goals. then 
let's talk about the kind that take 
athletic ability to get. Like those 
drive-the-middle-of-the-Iane, 360-
degree-spinning, over· the-rim, in-
your-face slam-dunk kind. Or the 
35- foot , cas t -off-at -t he- bu zzer, 
three-pointer that-puts-you-over-
the-hump-by·one variety. 

Now that folks, is a field goal. The 
athletic kind. Not some strange 
piece of pendulum work by a bionic 
leg from Biergarten, Austria via the 
University of Californ ia at Berkeley . 
C'mon Ray. Even basketball players 
look at the rim once in awhile. 

But who cares, anyway. The 
49ers are the champs, the Chargers 
are already favorites for next year, 
and football in 1981-82 is history. 

And now it's time WE GO TO 
THE HOOP! Bring on the roundball, 
guys in the striped shirts, scorers, 
timers, screaming fans and away we 
go .... UCSD Basketball is here! 

Hal Jacobs starts it ofLfall away

brick!...Haun is still on the floor 
reeling in pain .. Jeff Marks is going 
crazy, yelling at the official... "Ref , 
how could you miss that! ..... the 
whistle shrieks ... TIME OUT! 

Gary Hayne, the official, coolly 
walk to the center ofthe court, gets 
everyone's immediate atten tion and 
announces, "Fell as , I'm calling this 
game and it's going to stay under 
control. Now layoff the bellyaching 
and get back to playing basketball. 
Got it?" O.K. , Gary, whatever you 
sayL .. Everyone trots back to their 
positions. 

And 0 it goes. Anothersliceout of 
the life of basketball at UCSD. It 's 
here at last. The Budman is excited. 
And don't forget to look on these and 
future pages for more in·depth 
coverage of your fa vorite teams. The 
first early-season rankings are out 
and the Budman urges you to read 
them and weep. But if you're going 
to cry in your beer because your 
team didn 't make them, then make 
sure it's another brand. Cuz it'd be 
silly to waste an ice cold Bud that 
way.

Racquet Sports Pentathlon 

It wasn't exactly the Super Bowl, 
but after three day and a few 
thousand swings, the participants 
in last weekend's Racquet Sports 
Pentathlon definitely felt super. As 
in super tired. 

And although the turnout for this 
year 's affair was small, it was no 
le ·s than a smash hit among the 
competitors. 

The 1982 Champion was Revelle 
sophomore Rick Frey, a recent 
transfer frem UC Irvine, who 
parlayed strong finishes in all five 
events to post 450 points out of a 
possible 500. Frey won the tennis 
and squash events, finished econd 
in badminton and table tennis and 
garnered a third in racquetball to 
capture the title from Anthro grad 
student Gene Kumekawa. 

Frey's point total of 450 eclip ed 
the former 1M record of 1980 winner 
Peter Grant who had totalled 420. 
And by winning25 of his30 matches 
over the tree days, Frey exhibited a 
unique master of shots and strokes 
t hat had yet to be seen in this three-
year old event. 

Kumekawa who had be n 
pointing for this competition for the 
past two years. after finis hing a 

solid fourth in 1980, improved his lot 
with his second place showing thi 
year. Gene "The Machine" cranked 
out his usual first place finishes in 
badminton and table tennis and 
looked in fine shape going into 
Sunday' final rounds of 
competition, but Frey came 
charging at the end in squash and 
tennis to put Kumekawa on ice for 
another year. 

Although non ·plussed by his 
victory, Frey was genuinely excited 
that thi event was even in 
existence. 

"When I saw the Racquet Sports 
Pentathlon on the calendar at the 
beginning of the year, I couldn't 
wail for January to come. This thing 
wa right up my alley. I've been 
playing most of these sports for a 
long time now and I thought I might 
have a good chance to do well." 

An obvious understatement to be 
sure. Rick's "well" was more than 
good enough.

quarter. 

The Quality of bowlers is 
widely diversified with the 
lowest average around 50 and 
the highest at 190. The mean 
of the averages is about 120. It 
really doesn't matter what 
your average is because the 
league is a handicap one which 
menas that each Qowler get 
some extra pins each game, the 
amount of which is dependent 
on their average . Thi 
handicap tends to even up the 
teams and the matches are 
usually ver close. 

It all starts at 9 p.m. when

Bowling: a 
great start 
to the week 
, 'onl inuc d frulll pagt.' 17 
the light go on and there is 10 
minute of practice bowling. 
When it is time for competitive 
play the teams become loud , 
yelling and cheering for their 
teammates. There is clapping 
and whoopla for every strike 
and impromptu coaching after 
each bad shot. 

A good shot when it hits the 
pins sou nds crisp whereas a 
bad shot is noticeable by the 
semi-hollow sound of pins left 
standing. The styles of the 
players varies. Some throw 
the baIl as fa t as they can 
while others relea e the ball 
and walk away seeming afraid 
to look at the result. Some get 
set and go right away while 
others study the pins as if they 
were an AMES textbook. 

No matter what tyle or 
what average, all 136 bowler 
are having a good time. I f they 
are not bowling they are 
drinking, and if not drinking 
they are talking. No matter 
what they are doing they all 
admit that 1M bowling is a 
great way to start each week. 

Golf begins 
at Torrey 
continued from page 15 
up in hi knickers for the 
gallery. As he was about to tee 
off. a litt le old lady (there were 
lots of them there) chirped , " I 
love your knickers Bob!" He 
quickly res ponded with , 
"Thank you dear, it's the only 
place I can keep my dirty 
laundry." He then proceeded 
to slice the ball. Also there was 
Pat Boone, who was lying on 
his tomach to line up putts 
and still mis ing them; Efrem 
Zimbalist Jr, definitely the 
worst dressed golfer with a 
stunning orange-red ·yellow 
ensemble; J erry Ford with a 
securit y force larger than the 
Ga llery; and Jack Lemmon, 
who had the honor of playing 
with the Golden Bear. 

Nicklaus is a wonderful man 
to watch. He carrie. the 
express ion of a man in love but 
tortured by the whims of hi. 
game. He is a perfect ionist in a 
place where perfection is only 
a dream. 

o that was a portion of the 
scene at Torrey Pines. The 
real act ion starts today. If you 
attend , be sure to bring some 
tough hiking boots, a tankful 
of oxygen and lots of cold ca h. 
You can expect to hike up to 
three miles from your car to 
the first tee, and admission is 
$10. Now you know why the 
winner gets $45,000.

anything he said. He steps up 
to the microphone and starts 
to yell out all the e four-letter 
words. And it ricocheted on 
him. One after another in the 
audience later s aid to me, 
'Josh , even if we might agree 
on omething Rupert said, we 
would never follow him.' I 
asked them why. They said , 
'The basic difference was that 
he di played hatred and you 
displayed love.' I think I won 
the ~~dience through love that 
day .

looking up, Atkinson reported , 
but not perhap a much a it 
wa everal year ago when 
the United States normalized 
relations with the People' 
Republic . Atkin on detected 
orne ign of "retrenchment" 

during his visi t - indication 
that there are orne econd 
thought about Vice Premier 
Deng Xiao-ping' rna ive 
effort to get Chinese education 
back on its feet. 

A part of hi visit, Atkin on 
informally discu sed with the 
Peki ng government the 
current and future value of 
U.S. -China academIc ex -
change programs. There are 
currently orne 4,000 Chine e 
vi iting univer itie in the 
U.S. - nearly }OO at UC D 
alone. 

According to Atkin on, the 
program are proceeding well, 
with both side reaping rich 
beneftt . For the Chine e, it i ' 
an opportunity to train badly 
needed junior faculty for their 
univer itie . For the U. ., it i 
an opportunity for linguist, 
economi t and other ocial 
scientists to inve tigate 
China's unique socia l 
structure. 

Exchanges valuable 
" I think it' been a verr. 

advantageou agreement,' 
Atkin on said. He noted that it 
wa his signature, while till 
director of the National 
Science Foundation , that 
formalized the fir t memoran-
dum of understanding in 

hi tory between the two 
countries on the exchange of 
scienti t, scholar and 
tudent . Atkin on' negota-

tions - on the first of four 
trips to China - took place 
before normalization of 
relation between the two 
countrie occured in 1977. 

orne Chine e oil lea ing 
agreements that were in a 
en e politically tied to the 

academic exchanged have 
failed to develop, Atkinson 
noted, but he aid that this had 
not ignificantly affected the 
overall good impress ion made 
by the exchange program. 

Alth o ugh thl. time 
Atkin on wa not in China in 
an "officIal ev aluative 
capacity" (the trip was 
financed and pon ored by the 
National Academy of ci-
ences), he did di cus with 
Chine e government official 
and academician the 
pos ibility of holding a series 
of eminars to discus 

ientific policy and allocation 
of re ource . 

The academic situation in 
China is look ing up, at lea tin 
Atkinson' view. Although 
things are much better than 
they were just following the 
end of the cultural revolution, 
there i still a long way to go. 
But, according to Atkin on, "it 
will take them forever to catch 
up ... the effects of the la t 15 
years have been literally 
devastating. "

Twelve years, to be exact. 
McDowell had ju ' t returned 
from hi s speaking tours 
throughout Latin and South 
America . He was invited to 
participate in a debate at 
UCSD. 

" I wanted to debate 
(Herbert) Marcuse, but he says 
'['ve got a disciple who can do 
a well a I can .' 0 I said, 
'Okay, I'll take him on.' His 
name wa Herman Rupert. We 
did it out on Revelle Plaza. 
There mu t've been 3000. 
People were lined up all over 
the place. We debated on 
'Marxism Ver u Chri tian-

and preventing tenants from 
litigating the concept of what 
i "j u t cause .... " 

In the end, the real e tate 
lobby won a the Judiciary 
committee killed the bill. 

Before the vote, Bates aide 
Chri Dearth said he was not 
optimistic on the bill 's 
pas age. "The time has not 
come, but we want to continue 
the fight to keep the i sue alive 
and bring the problem into the 
open," said Dearth. 

Tenant groups- have one 
final chance to keep it alive 
this year . ~enator Alan 
Sieroty, D-Los Angeles, 
introduced a companion bill in 
the Senate la t year. 

Sieroty's bill i currently in 
the inactive file, and is not 
scheduled '0 be heard , even 
though Legi lative ru les 
require that it be approved no 
later than this Friday. 

But people in Sieroty's office 
said they will revive the 
legi lation "if we can get the 
vote ." 

The number might've 
dwindled during his second 
time around at UCSD, but the 
love still remained. Why el e 
would 600 people leave the 
rel at ive warmth of their 
homes or c1as rooms, wade 
throught the si dewalk s-
turned-flood channel , and 
cram into a crowded cafeteria 
in the middle of t he week to 
hear a man whom they knew 
virtually lit t le about save for 
hi first name? 

"My philosphy is I want to 
do my homework, love my 
audIence, be myself, and tell 
the truth," co ncluded 
McDowell . "If I do my 
homework, I can't be knocked 
down intellectually. If I love 
my audience, I can tell them 
what I need to say and they'll 
accept it. If I be my elf, they 
can't call me a hypocrite. If I 
tell the truth, they can't call 
me a liar."
