After a months-long search 
to replace Joseph W. Watson as 
vice chancellor of student affairs, 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox hired 
former University of Virginia Dean 
of Students Penny Rue this summer 
to tackle the hefty and often con-
troversial job. Only weeks into her 
new position, Rue said she plans to 
gauge the needs for campus com-
munity by talking firsthand with 
students.

After Watson announced his 
retirement last year, Fox began the 
recruitment process by assembling 
a search committee, which she co-
chaired with former Sixth College 
Provost Gabriele Wienhausen. 

Wienhausen said there were 
many applications for the position, 
though not all met the committee’s 
specifications.

“Not all applicants had demon-
strated records of success in all the 
areas of the job portfolio the univer-
sity was looking for,” she said.

The 24-person search commit-

tee — five of whom were students 
— selected three of the strongest 
candidates for intensive, day-long 
interviews that included an oppor-
tunity for the public to meet the 
candidate and provide feedback.

Rue had been the dean of stu-
dents at the University of Virginia 
since 1999, and prior to that, 
senior associate dean of students at 

Georgetown University. The other 
two top candidates were Jean Marie 
Scott, the acting vice chancellor of 
student affairs at UC Santa Cruz, 
and Melissa Vito, the vice provost of 
student affairs and dean of students 
at the University of Arizona.

A heated six-month discourse 
ended last week between the 
University of California and a labor 
union representing academic stu-
dent employees, which agreed to a 
two-year labor contract that would 
provide workers with improved 
wages, health care and benefits, and 
put an end to threats of a strike.

Tensions between United Auto 
Workers Local 2865 and the uni-
versity erupted last month, when 
the UAW filed dozens of unfair 
labor practice charges against the 
UC system for allegedly stalling and 
obstructing negotiations for a new 
and improved contract for teach-
ing assistants and readers, among 
other employees. The union threat-
ened the university with a strike if 
a mutual agreement was not met 
by Sept. 30, the expiration of the 
prior labor contract.

The agreement is a relief to UAW 
and UC bargaining teams, as well as 
the approximate 12,000 academic 
student employees directly affected 
by the new labor contract. 

Negotiation proceedings had 
been fraught with shared feelings of 
frustration, tension and exhaustion.

The year 1930 was history for 
Torrey Pines, when famed aviator 
Charles Lindbergh floated his sailplane 
off the top of Mount Soledad to a cush-
ioned landing on a beach near Del Mar, 
using the air lift generated by the tow-
ering cliffs now west of North Torrey 
Pines Road. Today, a planned expan-
sion of UCSD that would include new 
housing for transfer students threatens 
the gliderport’s livelihood, generating a 
yet-unresolved rift between the long-
peaceful neighbors.

According to the Torrey Pines 
Gliderport Historical Society, the site 
“is the only gliderport adjacent to the 
West Coast of America that supports 
four different forms of motorless avia-
tion: hang gliders, paragliders, radio-
controlled model sailplanes and full-
scale sailplanes.”

Though it is nestled between a 
research institute and a PGA-tour golf 
course, the gliderport has, for the most 
part, maintained neutral relations with 
its neighbors. However, the growing 
campus, contiguous to the historical 
site, has reached the limits of the land 
it was designated by the city of San 
Diego. Due to an increased demand 
for on-campus housing, UCSD has 
broken ground on a 14-story residen-
tial building for transfer students at the

Following last spring’s student 
walkout protesting the decision to 
not rehire two dismissed Dimensions 
of Culture teaching assistants — and 
amid the chaos of Spring Quarter 
finals week — came a campuswide 
e-mail announcing the revision of a 
policy governing free speech and advo-
cacy on campus. 

On June 8, students received an 
e-mail announcing the revision of 
Section IX of the university properties 
use policy, originally written in 1981, 
to outline permitted speech, advocacy 
and distribution of literature. The e-
mail provided a link to the new pro-
posal and asked students and staff to 
submit comments by June 25 — cre-
ating a two-week window, including 
finals week and the start of summer, 
to respond.

More than 80 concerned students 
met with former Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Joseph W. Watson on 
June 11 to voice their qualms about 
the new policy, which would section

With Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
now considering a bill that would 
allow undocumented students to 
qualify for financial aid, many UC 
students — including some at UCSD 
— have staged demonstrations over 
the past three weeks to lobby for the 
legislation’s approval.

The Development, Relief and 
Education for Alien Minors Act — 
better known as the D.R.E.A.M. Act 
— was passed by the state Legislature 
three weeks ago following several 
years of debate. Two weeks later, 
Schwarzenegger has still not signed 

the bill, provoking an Oct. 1 rally 
led by the UC Student Association 
at the state capitol. The group urged 
action on the item before it expires 
in a month.

First Pharmacy Class 

Receives Top Exam Scores 
The inaugural graduating class 

of the UCSD Skaggs School of 
Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical 
Sciences recorded top scores in 
the 2006 national and state phar-
macy licensure exams.  

The 24 members of the charter 
class, who entered the Skaggs 
School in 2002, were the first 
to complete the four-year pro-
gram and gain their doctorates 
in pharmacy. Their average score 
was well above both the California 
state and national average for 
the North American Pharmacist 
Licensure Examination, according 
to school officials. 

Developed by the National 
Association of Boards of Pharmacy, 
the examination is part of the 
boards’ assessment of compe-
tence to practice pharmacy. 

“Successes of this nature clearly 
demonstrate that the University of 
California made a great investment 
in these students and in starting a 
professional pharmacy program at 
UCSD,” said Palmer Taylor, found-
ing dean of the Skaggs School and 
associate vice chancellor of health 
sciences at UCSD, in a press 
release. “Continuation of this sup-
port will pay dividends in health 
care and pharmaceutical research 
across the state of California for 
years to come.”

NAPLEX measures three 
aspects of pharmaceutical com-
petence: safe and effective phar-
macotherapy and optimizing ther-
apeutic outcomes, safe and accu-
rate preparation and dispensing of 

medications, and providing health 
care information and promoting 
public health. 

Student Runner-Up in NY 
Times Mag Essay Contest

Travis Weinger, a Revelle College 
senior majoring in history with a 
minor in political science, was one 
of four runners-up in New York 
Times Magazine essay contest.

His essay “Why College Matters” 
was submitted in response to the 
magazine’s online essay published 
in July titled “What’s the Matter 
with College?” by historian Rick 
Perlstein. College students across 
the nation were encouraged to 
offer their opinions on the Perlstein 
essay and explain the impact of 
higher education.  

Weinger is a founder of the 
Triton, a UCSD newspaper, and 
of the Symposium, an on-campus 
discussion group.  

According to the New York 
Times Web site, about 600 under-
graduates replied with mixed reac-
tions.

Many agreed with Perlstein’s 
contention that “college as 
America used to understand it is 
coming to an end” while others 
dismissed the argument or cri-
tiqued higher education from an 
insider’s point of view.

The winning essay, “The 
Posteverything Generation” by 
Nicholas Handler, a junior at Yale 
University, was published in New 
York Times Magazine and online 
on NYTimes.com and mtvU.com.  
Semifinalists had their essays 
published on NYTimes.com.

off the campus into free-speech zones, 
restrict the political activity of univer-
sity staff and regulate advocacy and 
distribution of literature.

Some students, such as Sixth 
College sophomore Juan Vazquez, 
noted the limited time slot and 
pressed for a meeting with Watson. 
Vazquez created a Facebook.com 
group as well as the Web site www.
ucsdfreespeech.com to inform stu-
dents about the policy and mobi-
lize students to attend the meeting. 
Watson met with students on June 
11, and the large student mobiliza-
tion caused the comment period to 
be extended until Dec. 1.

The policy revision has been under 
development since 2001 to update 
the 26-year-old document in light 
of changes in the law regarding free 
speech, according to UCSD Associate 
Controller and committee Chair Sally 
Brainerd. However, some students said 
they believe the policy may have been 
rushed in response to certain con-
troversial free speech activities of the 
previous year.

Eddie Brown, director of off-cam-
pus Christian organization Justice 
House of Prayer San Diego, said he 
believes that the revision is in direct 
response to the group’s preaching on 
Library Walk and in Price Center Plaza 
last year. 

“The true reason UCSD is chang-
ing the free-speech policy is because 
for the last five months they have been 
subject to hearing the word of God 
being taught and exclaimed,” Brown 
said last June.

Brown often came to UCSD to 
meet with Christian students to public-
ly preach about God and Christianity, 
several times facing visits from the 
police or having University Centers 
administrators silence them due to 
alleged free-speech violations.

Former graduate student Jeff Wong 
said in an e-mail that he was stopped 
from speaking on the round stage in 

Price Center by University Centers 
Director Paul Terzino last March, sup-
posedly for violating free speech and 
sound amplification rules, although he 
was using no amplification.

Wong said he approached 
University Centers administration to 
inquire about the violation, and they 
responded that they were working on 
new rules to fix that discrepancy. He 
said they accused him of breaking part 
of the new policy that forbids any per-
son from being an involuntary audience 
member or participant of an event.

“They effectively told me that 
because people didn’t like what I 
was speaking on that I had to stop,” 

Wong said. “I have never seen in the 
Constitution the part about only say-
ing things that people agree with.” 

Terzino said he could not remem-
ber the encounters, but said that the 
Price Center Plaza is event space that 
must be reserved by filling out a form 
15 days in advance.

“The reason Mr. Brown or Mr. 
Wong would have been asked to leave 
is because they were using the plaza 
for a program without a reservation,” 
Terzino said.

Exhibit A of the policy revision 
outlines “designated public forums” 
on campus where free speech is per-
mitted without reservation, including 
Revelle Plaza, Muir College quad, and 
Warren Mall — along with other col-
lege quads, grassy areas and plazas. 

The policy also allows free speech 
in other outdoor areas 25 feet from 
building entrances and away from 
campus roads “with the exception 
of program space, such as athletics 
fields, Price Center Plaza and Library 
Walk, which are subject to separate 
rules and regulations governing their 
use.”

Such areas are activity spaces 
administered by campus depart-
ments responsible for schedul-
ing them according to the venues’ 
intended purposes, Brainerd said in 
an e-mail. 

Brainerd said that the use policies 
for Price Center and Library Walk 
are on the University Centers Web 
site, but the policy for Price Center 
only addresses sound amplification 
rules.

“The Plaza is and always has been 
a reservable programmable space and 
falls under the same guidelines as 
spaces such as the ballroom, theater, 
etc.” Terzino said. “We need to update 
some of the language on the Web site 
and include the programmable spaces 
such as the ballroom, theater and plaza 
in explaining our policies.”

Some students and concerned 
observers have questioned the con-
stitutionality of dividing the campus 
up in terms of free speech. Samantha 
Harris, director of Legal and Public 
Advocacy for the Foundation for 
Individual Rights in Education, sent a 
letter to UCSD on June 22, addressing 
the concern.

“Establishing ‘free speech zones,’ as 
UCSD seeks to do here, undermines 
the fundamental conception of the 
American public university as a true 
marketplace of ideas,” Harris said.

Brainerd said that representa-
tives from the A.S. Council and the 
Graduate Student Association have 
recently been invited to join the 
revision committee.

Graduate Student

intersection of North Point Drive and 
Scholars Drive North, east of Torrey 
Pines Road.

Though the proposal will benefit 
transfer students — who currently 
have no guaranteed on-campus hous-
ing — officials at the gliderport, the 
Associated Glider Clubs of Southern 
California and other related organi-
zations are opposed to the planned 
building’s location, which they say 
would block the favored landing path 
of the gliders. 

“Gliders follow the normal flight 
approach, like a majority of other air-
craft,” said David Jebb, current opera-
tor of the gliderport. “This approach 
is physically shaped like an ‘L’ with a 
hook on the end. The completed new 
building would obstruct this path for 
the pilots.”

Pilots usually land by advancing 
toward UCSD from the coastline, turn-
ing around 180 degrees to an eased 
landing on the runway. With plans 
for the housing structure to be built 
on top of the former north parking 
lot in Eleanor Roosevelt College, this 
particular approach would no longer 
be available to gliders. They would 
instead have to land directly over the 
ocean, making landings much riskier, 
Jebb said.

However, UCSD officials say that 
the location of the residential building 
was a thought-out choice. In 2004, the 
UCSD Long Range Development Plan 
was reconfigured in order to meet 
the needs of the university’s quickly 
expanding population. Before plans 
were formalized, the public was invited 
to comment on the proposal.

The region of the campus that 
runs along Torrey Pines Road was 
designated as an area for housing, a 
fact acknowledged by the gliderport’s 
managers.

“We have been aware of the plans 
UCSD had for the land,” AGCSC 
Historian Gary Fogel said. “The whole 
idea of planting a 14-story building, 

however, kind of snuck up on us. We 
had no idea they planned for such a 
tall structure.”

Key gliderport members hope to 
preserve the gliderport a functional 
facility as well as a historical landmark.

In a majority of cases, UCSD sub-
mits an environmental impact report to 
assess the effect a construction project 
would have on the immediate and sur-
rounding areas. However, UCSD chose 
a much shorter path, instead initiating 
a “mitigated negative declaration” — a 
document stating that no significant 
environmental effects will occur; or if 
they do, they will be mitigated.

“The project has already been 
approved and there are site-specific 

plans associated with that project … 
moving the project would be cost-
ly, and it would cause delays for no 
apparent reason,” UCSD Director of 
Community Planning Milton Phegley 
said. “The presumed purpose in mov-
ing the project would be to lessen 
any potential effect on the gliderport, 
[however] the Coastal Commission 
has determined that the building will 
have no impact on glider operations. 
It would be both a pointless and a very 
poor expenditure of student funds.”

In addition to the AGCSC, neither 
the La Jolla Historical Society nor the 
State Office of Historical Preservation 
gave their approval of the project. 
Despite a strong showing of disap-
proval, construction was greenlighted 

by the UC Board of Regents, making 
the plans official. 

However, according to 
Executive Director of University 
Communications Dolores Davies, a 
much more in-depth process must 
occur before the entire project is for-
mally approved.

After the project finds an adequate 
location in accordance with the long 
range development plan, it will be ana-
lyzed by the physical planning depart-
ment to measure its compliance with 
campus conformity, Davies said. Next, 
the campus community planning com-
mittee — composed of students, fac-
ulty, staff and administration represen-
tatives — will finalize the location and 
parameters of the project.

Then the campus design review 
board, composed of off-campus archi-
tects, gives individual input about the 
design of the project. The reviews are 
sent to Chancellor Marye Anne Fox, 
and after, in the case of large projects, to 
the regents. Projects must comply with 
the California Environmental Quality 
Act, and in this case, review from the 
California Coastal Commission. 

Reviews from any historical preser-
vation interest groups are not included 
in the process.

“More than 40 years ago, UCSD 
was given land by the city of San Diego 
under the idea that they would be 
friendly neighbors in the community,” 
Fogel said. “While we are in no way 
opposed to the university increasing 
housing for undergraduates, we hope 
they will comply with their agreement 
as a member of the community.”

All Campus Transfer Association 
President Marwan Azzam said he 
believes the controversy surrounding 
the site is unwarranted.

“I think it’s ridiculous that the gli-
derport is making such an issue about 
this,” he said. “I’ve never seen a glider

who had not familiarized them-
selves with UCSD’s challenges,” said 
Chris Sholley, former A.S. represen-
tative and a member of the search 
committee. “Dr. Rue adeptly under-
stood that many UCSD students 
graduate without the sense of a ‘col-
lege experience.’”

Having completed her disserta-
tion on the elements that develop 
a sense of community on college 
campuses, Rue stood out from the 
other candidates.

“Her very first comment to us 
expressed her desire to make the 
community at UCSD as strong as 
the academics at UCSD,” Graduate 
Student Association representa-
tive and committee member Aaron 
Parker said. “I was immediately 
impressed with Dr. Rue as soon as 
the interview began. She has a very 
effective, direct and articulate way 
of communicating. She was ener-
getic, had a sense of humor and was 
completely at ease in a room full of 
strangers asking 
very tough and 
specific questions 
of her.”

We i n haus e n 
said the com-
mittee was told 
to provide Fox a 
list of the finalists 
in a non-ranked 
order, which 
she then used to 
make a final deci-
sion.

Rue’s appoint-
ment began on Sept. 10, and since 
then she has hit the ground run-
ning. 

“The best analogy I can give is 
‘drinking from a fire hose’ — there’s 
a lot to absorb very quickly,” Rue 
said. “I’m trying to go to as many 
events as I can. … It’s a little hectic, 
but that is student affairs and that’s 
what makes it fun.”

Rue said that she was quite happy 
with her duties at UVA and wasn’t 
originally looking for a new job. 
But once she had an opportunity to 
learn about UCSD, she decided to 
apply for the position.

“I guess the real opportunity was 
the sense that this is really an institu-
tion on the rise,” Rue said. “Virginia 
was a fabulous place and I loved 
being there. The whole time I had 
been there, it had been the number-
one or number-two public universi-
ty in the country, with UC Berkeley 
being the other school. And that’s 
not going to change there.” 

Rue cited UCSD’s youth and 
ambition as two primary reasons 
she decided to move across the 
country for a position similar to her 
prior job at UVA.

“This is an institution that really 
has room to move and is excited 
about being entrepreneurial and 
trying new things, positioning itself 
for real leadership in higher educa-
tion,” she said. “The weather is not 
bad either.”

Since her arrival, Rue has made 
it a priority to talk with students 

and develop relationships to facili-
tate a sense of campus community. 
From assisting with move-in and 
serving ice cream alongside Fox at 
Triton Power Hour, to eating hot 
dogs with athletes and square danc-
ing with international students, she 
has made an effort to get to know 
the students she represents.

“I got into this business to be 
in relationships with students,” Rue 
said. “That’s not going to change. 
That may mean that I allocate my 
time differently than other people 
would, but, this role wouldn’t be 
any fun for me if I didn’t get the 
opportunities to be in conversations 
with students about what they really 
cared about.”

Many students and staff, includ-
ing Rue, have agreed that leading 
student affairs is a difficult job. 

“She’s adapting to the campus 
quickly, even though as far as I could 
tell she didn’t really grasp the campus 
politics earlier,” former A.S. president 
and member of the search committee 

Harry Khanna 
said.

Rue has invit-
ed her staff to 
speak to her to 
create a friendly 
and encourag-
ing environ-
ment. However, 
she also plans to 
personally ana-
lyze what the 
campus climate 
is like.

“I  wi l l 
become one of the chief transmit-
ters of the [UCSD] culture — one 
of the people that help tell others 
what’s special about this place,” Rue 
said. “So, I can read about what’s 
written about that, but I need to 
get my own feel for that and I do 
that primarily in relationships with 
students.”

To create the sense of community 
that she feels UCSD needs, Rue has 
made one of her goals the creation 
of campus traditions, like those at 
UVA and Georgetown. At UVA, she 
was responsible for helping create a 
student activity center and an office 
of fraternity and sorority life to sup-
port student life. 

Rue acknowledges that she can-
not simply transplant such tradi-
tions here, but hopes that her con-
versations with students and the 
resources she has available will 
“springboard into traditions.”

The vice chancellor of student 
affairs position oversees nearly 
every department impacting stu-
dents, including admissions, enroll-
ment, residential life, sports facili-
ties and programs, student educa-
tional advancement, student life, 
student policies and judicial affairs, 
career services, intercollegiate ath-
letics, the international center and 
student research and information 
— and comes with an annual salary 
of $215,000.

The preceding contract between the 
two parties had expired at 12 a.m. 
on Oct. 1, and efforts to reach a 
new agreement resulted in hour-by-
hour time extensions well into the 
morning.

“Negotiations were difficult, gru-
eling, exhausting,” UC Santa Barbara 
graduate student and UAW negotiat-
ing team member 
Daraka Larimore-
Hall said. “As you 
can see, the [UAW] 
bargaining team 
went until 2 a.m. 
after the expired 
time.” 

However, the 
prolonged hours of 
negotiation yielded 
what both sides are 
calling positive 
results. 

According to 
Larimore-Hall, the bargaining teams 
emerged from negotiation proceed-
ings content with the new contract 
and confident of its future ratifica-
tion by union vote.

“We’re very happy with the agree-
ment that was reached,” Larimore-
Hall said. 

UC Office of the President 
spokeswoman Nicole Savickas 
expressed a similar optimism.

“I can’t speculate on how it will 

be received by the representative 
employees but our bargaining team 
was very pleased as well as the 
UAW,” she said.

The union’s demands achieved 
its goal of providing greater eco-
nomic and noneconomic security 
for its members. Its other concerns 
include the lack of health coverage 
options available for academic stu-

dent employees 
with families.

The new 
contract may 
help graduate 
students cope 
with a recent 
increase in 
UC graduate 
school tuition 
— a minimum 
of 7 percent 
each year for 
the next three 
years — which 

was approved by the UC committees 
on educational policy and finance 
last month.

“A long, tough and exhausting 
process has come to an end,” bar-
gaining team member Carol Wheeler 
said in a press release.

UAW members plan to ratify the 
agreement by vote on Oct. 9.

Settlement Approval Still

Rights Awareness Organization at 
UCSD camped out on Library Walk 
on Oct. 4, asking students to call 
the governor’s office to express their 
opinion or sign petitions supporting 
the bill. 

“In order to make a living, you 
have to have an education first,” 
said Sixth College senior Tara 
Ramanathan, who called in her sup-
port for the bill. 

UCSA has been working along 
multiple channels to codify the 
D.R.E.A.M. Act.

“We’ve had a couple of actions,” 
UCSA Organizing Director Jennifer 
Knox said. “We were able to collect 
over 300 signatures.”

Following the rally, UCSA is plan-
ning to urge students to lobby in their 
district offices as well.

The D.R.E.A.M. Act was writ-
ten to allow undocumented students 
— a demographic that currently 
cannot apply for financial aid — to 
become eligible for non-competitive 
Cal Grants and community college fee 
waivers. According to Grecia Lima, a 
junior at Eleanor Roosevelt College 
and MRAO member, access to com-
petitive Cal Grants was not included 
in the bill because Schwarzenegger 
vetoed an earlier version of the act con-
taining those provisions. At the time, 
Schwarzenegger expressed concerns 
about taking financial aid away from 
documented students and citizens.

The Entitlement Cal Grants are 
guaranteed to all students that recent-

ly graduated high school, are pursu-
ing a two- or four-year degree, and 
demonstrate financial need. Funds 
for the program are allocated based 
on the number of eligible students 
graduating from state high schools. 

Since many undocumented stu-
dents graduate high school but do 

not continue on to higher education, 
not all of the allocated money is being 
used. According to Lima, only 68 per-
cent of the money for the Cal Grants 
is currently in use, leaving enough 
funding to provide financial aid for 
undocumented students.

The D.R.E.A.M. Act builds on 
Assembly Bill 540, which was passed 
in 2001. Under that legislation, 
undocumented students who gradu-
ate from a California high school in 
three or more years and sign a state-
ment pledging to apply for residency 
as soon as they are eligible are award-
ed in-state tuition at any California 
state college or university.

Despite the reduced tuition costs 
for eligible students, the university 
still estimates that there are only 340 
to 632 undocumented undergradu-
ate students and five to 11 graduate 
students in the entire UC system. 
The figures are not exact because 
undocumented students apply to col-
lege without providing their Social 
Security numbers, but there are cases 
of documented students doing the 
same.

“The university doesn’t really 
know because we don’t ask that ques-
tion,” UCSD Financial Aid Director 
Vincent De Anda said. 

The UC system has supported 
access to higher education for undoc-
umented minors, including AB 540 
and now SB1. University officials sent 
a letter to the governor’s office last 
month expressing their support for 
the D.R.E.A.M. Act.

“[The D.R.E.A.M.] Act is more a 
fairness issue … here is a student that 
spent all their life here and worked 
hard to get in, but when they’re set 
to go [to college], they can’t get the 
funding,” De Anda said. 

Students have until Oct. 14 to 
lobby for the D.R.E.A.M. Act’s pas-
sage before the bill expires and 
will have to be reintroduced in the 
state Legislature next year. The U.S. 
Congress has also been debating a 
similar version of the bill for the past 
few years.

I’m sure you were just as proud of our beloved university as I was back in 2005, when Newsweek 
named UCSD the “hottest” institution 
in the country for students studying 
science. Yes, our dear school is defi-
nitely the place to be if organic chem-
istry molecular model kits and gradu-

ated cylinders strike your fancy. But 
here’s a secret that not many people at 
UCSD may realize until after graduat-
ing: Contrary to popular belief, it is in 
fact okay to be something other than a 
biology major at UCSD. 

I know this may come as an unwel-
come surprise to some of you students 
who have mapped out the next 15 
years of your lives, and who have long 
sported those UCSD Medical School 
sweatshirts that your parents bought 
for you at the bookstore the moment 
they heard that you were going to such 
a sexy science institution. But science 
is not the subject for everyone, and 
after years of self-delusion and parental 
persuasion it is very difficult for some 
of us to realize that. 

Looking back on my freshman 
year, I remember how virtually every-
one that I hung out with in the Blake 
dorms at Revelle College was a human 
biology major hoping to get into a 
prestigious medical school after gradu-
ation in order to please their parents. 
For a long time, I was part of this mas-
sive clique, proudly sporting the goggle 
prints left on my face from introducto-
ry chemistry lab and spending my free 
time at CLICS late at night studying for 
Friday physics quizzes.

Well, freshman year has come and 
gone, and a great deal has changed 
since then. After countless nights 
of stressing myself out over organic 
chemistry midterms and weekly phys-
ics lab assignments, I felt that I had 
learned a great deal at my renowned 
science school — such as figuring out 
that I wasn’t such a big fan of my biol-
ogy major after all. 

Granted, there are many students 
well-suited for their science majors at 
UCSD, but in retrospect, I certainly 
was majoring in human biology for 
all the wrong reasons. I thought that 
it would make my family proud; I 
thought that all the smart kids were 
doing it; I thought that being a doc-
tor would make me wealthy and that 
money would solve all of my problems 
in life. It comforted me and, at the same 
time, upset me to know that so many 
other students were in the same boat. 

The longer I stayed in my major, 
the more hopeless I felt about chang-
ing it. By the end of my second year, 
I thought I’d resort to finishing up my 
original four-year plan and getting my 
degree in biology despite my reserva-
tions. Maybe I could force myself to 
like it. Besides, I didn’t want to have to 
start over after coming so far, or being 
the sibling in my family that didn’t fin-
ish college in four years. 

But during the beginning of last 
year, I finally came to my senses and 
changed my mind. I was enrolled in 
four upper division biology classes and 
I pretty much hated life. This may 
seem like a drastic move, but after 
talking with my sister about how mis-

NATIONAL NEWS — In the latest 
chapter of the checkered history of 
the No Child Left Behind Act, the 
National Assessment of Educational 
Progress released gloomy testing 
results for 2007. Last week, President  
George W. Bush issued a proclamation 
that America’s educational system has 
achieved outstanding results thanks 
to the No Child Left Behind based 
on these results. Supporters of the No 
Child Left Behind policy rallied behind 
the results, which show that American 
children have slightly improved their 
math scores since the program’s birth, 
but barely made progress in reading 
skills. Calling this a huge accomplish-
ment is beyond the wildest interpreta-
tions of the word “success.”

According to the results published 
by the NAEP, both the fourth grade 
reading and math scores improved 
by two points (on a scale of 500) dur-
ing 2005. However, for eighth grade 
students the average reading score has 
actually fallen by one point since the No 
Child Left Behind 
Act was adopted. 
For a piece of leg-
islation hailed as a 
massive step for-
ward in educational 
reform, this is a 
stunning failure.

While NAEP 
maintains that a 
two-point improve-
ment in test scores 
is “statistically sig-
nificant” on its Web 
site, because the 
standard deviation 
of the results is less than the differ-
ence between the scores, a two-point 
improvement amounts to a two fifths 
of a percent improvement.

However, improving test scores 
by 0.4 percent really means nothing 
when a large percentage of students are 

not even capable of passing by NAEP 
standards. For example, according to 
NAEP, reaching a basic level of profi-
ciency in fourth-grade math basically 
boils down to being able to do fourth 
grade level arithmetic. Happily claim-
ing that fourth grade math scores are 

at their highest 
level in 17 years 
means nothing 
if 18 percent 
of the students 
cannot attain 
a basic rating 
at the required 
material, as is 
the case today, 
according to the 
NAEP. The pic-
ture worsens in 
the eighth grade, 
where almost 30 
percent of the 

students cannot achieve NEAP stan-
dards for basic proficiency in grade-
level material.

Still more concerning is that read-
ing scores have actually fallen since 
two years ago. Even if the average 
scores had gone up, over a quarter of 

eighth graders fail to read at a basic 
level, according to NAEP figures. This 
means that they are unable to “demon-
strate a literal understanding of what 
they read and be able to make some 
interpretations … for text appropri-
ate to eighth grade” according to the 
NAEP’s standards. In the face of such 
an awesome failure, the chairman of 
the National Assessment Governing 
Board’s only reply was that “the edu-
cational establishment needs to look at 
middle school reading to see why we’re 
not making progress there” in an inter-
view with the New York Times.

Supporters of the No Child Left 
Behind Act and other optimists would 
point to what appear to be solid gains 
made in mathematics over the past 
five years as evidence that the system 
is working. These gains, however, have 
been made as a result of schools being 
forced to focus completely on reading 
and mathematics as a result of the 
No Child Left Behind Act. Teaching 
students material specifically for a test, 
especially standardized tests, does not 
mean that students are actually profi-

OPINION
MONDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2007

ON CAMPUS — Just as UCSD students were cramming for 
finals and the 2006-07 academic year was coming to a close, a 
policy update snuck onto the table. It was impeccably convenient 
timing for university officials, since the majority of students were 
too overwhelmed with end-of-the-year work to even notice the 
severe blow to their rights. 

And its no wonder why administrators were so clandestine 
about the new document — the revision of section 501 of the 
UCSD Policy and Procedure Manual transformed a two-page 
guide to outdoor-space use, which generally aimed to protect 
constitutional freedoms while maintaining safety and func-
tionality, into a 19-page paternalistic manifesto, which prohib-
its everything from chalking sidewalks to free gatherings of 
more than 10 people. 

A committee chaired by UCSD Associate Controller Sally 
Brainerd, was charged with revising the policy so that it ensures 
a “climate for free and open expression while providing a safe 
environment.” What they did was produce a document that is 
frightening in its absolute dictatorial outlook on freedom. 

The revision groups outdoor areas into “Designated Public 
Forums,” and then outlines how such forums are governed. Fair 
enough, right? Sure, except that the most central, and arguably 
most important, forums — Library Walk and Price Center for 

example — aren’t included in this public-forum designation at 
all. Instead these places are categorized as “program space,” which 
are governed separately, and significantly more vaguely, by the 
Library Walk and Sound Amplification Policies. Though docu-
ments regulating these areas remain nebulous at best, there is no 
actual written policy outlining rules for Price Center. Instead it 
seems these parts of campus are left to the discretion of inconsis-
tent administrators.   

But as the heart of campus activity, shouldn’t these sites 
be, above all, public forums? Isn’t Library Walk, with Geisel 
Library towering proudly in the distance, always used as UCSD’s 
emblematic icon? 

Forget for a moment that these two hotspots are left at the 
whim of agenda-laden university officials, and remember that 
students’ rights are protected at all the other outdoor spaces —
like college quad areas — which are governed as public forums.

Actually, not quite. The new policy would monitor activities 
at public forums heavily. According to Brainerd, one focus of 
the committee was to protect listeners from being forced into an 
audience involuntarily. This means, for example, that, no matter 
where you are, if someone doesn’t want to hear you, it’s you that 
has to leave, not them. This change is baffling because it defies all 
logic. Isn’t a public forum, by definition, a place for individuals to 
express their complaints, ideas and beliefs freely and openly?

SMOTHERING
STUDENT VOICES

a new campus policy, if enacted, would severely hamper students’  
right to free speech, making it near impossible for student groups to  

organize and protest in numerous popular campus areas.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2007 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

By Hadley Mendoza
Senior Staff Writer

LOCAL NEWS — Though 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox should 
be recognized for taking one step 
forward to achieve her transfer-
housing goal, the new 14-story resi-
dential building poised to sit beside 
Cafe Ventanas has already become 
a point of community contention 
— and ground for the project was 
only just broken.

The problem stems from UCSD’s 
negligence in analyzing possible 
detrimental impacts the project 
would cause for the university’s 
neighbors. Planners, led by Director 
of Community Planning Milton 
Phegley, completed a brief mitigated 
negative declaration — a shorter 
report that states there is no envi-
ronmental impact — rather than 
investigating the potential influence 
on the surrounding area through 
a more extensive environmental 
impact report. 

But this hasty administrative 
decision is one that wrongs not only 
students, but La Jolla community 
members as well. 

Aside from the on-campus park-
ing woes the project has already 
caused, the new building threatens 
to shut down the historic Torey 
Pines Gliderport by obstructing its 
main landing path.

The summary campus plan-
ners submitted to the UC Board of 
Regents and the California Coastal 
Commission for approval reported 
that the new building would have 
no impact on the gliderport’s exist-
ing flight paths. This, however, is an 

obvious fallacy. 
Instead, the building would 

stand smack in the middle of the 
most convenient and often-used 
path, leaving the gliderport nearly 
useless. UCSD’s complete disregard 
for this culturally and historically 
rich site reveals a startling discon-
nect that seems almost irrational. 

While gliderport patrons — both 
pilots and historians — have written 
to the chancellor and regents asking 
that the project be seriously recon-
sidered, or even moved just a few 
hundred feet out of the flight path, 
university officials have ignored 

these pleas. 
Instead, Phegley has continued 

denying reality, claiming over and 
over that the path would remain 
unaffected. Meanwhile, aviators 
familiar with the path and third-
party officials such as State Historic 
Preservation Officer M. Wayne 
Donaldson have said otherwise, 
repeating that the mitigated nega-
tive declaration was hurried and 
flawed.

As it appears now, an 80-year-
old historical site — the only place 
in the country where gliders can 
take off from coastal cliffs — will 
be crushed by what’s sure to be a 
skyscraping eyesore.

And for what? So that a few 
transfer students can take part in 
the dorm-life experience? Forget for 

a moment that most adults well out 
of high school aren’t exactly dying 
to eat overpriced cafeteria macaroni 
and deal with paternalistic residen-
tial security officers every night, and 
pretend that UCSD is just looking 
out for the well-being of students. If 
this is the case, why can’t university 
officials compromise? Moving the 
project over just a few hundred feet 
wouldn’t stop transfer students from 
participating in on-campus events, 
and the gliderport could remain 
a vibrant and thriving part of La 
Jolla.

It almost seems like Fox and 
Phegley’s stubborn and illogical sep-
aration from reality could be moti-
vated by something more than pure 
ignorance.

Considering this, it is interesting 
to imagine what would happen in 
three years, after the project is com-
pleted and the gliderport — with its 
most popular flight path blocked 
— becomes a virtually unused plot 
of land. 

Meanwhile, UCSD will have 
finished as much construction as 
is possible within its allotted land; 
although there are still parking lots 
to be built upon, east campus is 
already more or less filled. 

So there administrators will sit, 
having built the campus to its brim 
with still so much more planned, 
looking down the road at a success-
fully crushed gliderport. The plot 
of land — conveniently empty and 
conveniently adjacent to campus 
— may begin to look pretty appeal-
ing. And with a strong eminent-
domain argument, why wouldn’t 
city officials be swayed to hand the 
seemingly worthless land over to 
university planners?

Curious, very curious. 
But that’s all speculation of 

course — rewind to the present, 
and all you’ve got is a cluster of 
careless administrators, a bunch of 
pissed-off pilots and an ominous 
pile of dirt. 

A.S. Priorities Amiss for 
Student Enterprises

Dear Editor,
I read with great interest Marissa 

Blunschi’s recent eulogy (“New 
Manager Detracts from Grove’s 
Student-Run Spirit”) for a simpler 
time, the days when any student 
could buy a cup of overpriced java 
from a fellow student and when the 
A.S. Council had few qualms about 
using student fees to subsidize a 
high-paying job for the ineffectual 
student employees who used to run 
the Grove Caffe. Ah, the good old 
days. 

Unfortunately, she seems to 
ignore a major question that most 
of us should have been asking long 
ago: Why should the student gov-
ernment be in the business of run-
ning a coffee shop, anyway? 

After all, the “young entre-
preneurs” of the Grove for whom 
Blunschi has so much empathy can 
still find the same “hands-on busi-
ness experience” she bemoans has 
gone the way of the dodo by getting 
a job at any local Starbucks — they 
could even save the $20,000 they 
pay each year for a degree that will 
do little to enhance their standing 
in the coffee-shop world. And, as 
Blunschi herself admits, the Grove’s 
menu of “salads, sandwiches and 
cappuccinos, though delicious, can 
often be found at many, much more 
convenient locations on campus.” 

In answering the question I 
posed above, I would like to resur-
rect the test I offered many years 
ago on these very pages: The stu-
dent government should be in the 
business of running a business only 
when it can provide students with 
products or work experiences they 
simply can’t find elsewhere. (Note 
that this test applies only to the so-
called “A.S. Enterprises;” nothing 
stops the council from re-charter-
ing the Grove as a student service 

to add to its list of budgetary black 
holes that already receive generous 
student funding for alleged contri-
butions to student life.) 

Neither the Grove, nor, for that 
matter, most of the A.S. Council’s 
other enterprises would pass my 
test. After all, why should students 
wait in line to buy a reader from 
Soft Reserves when they could get it 
hand-delivered to their classroom at 
a cheaper price (as they used to be 
able to do, before the student gov-
ernment kicked private university 
reader services off campus)? 

With all of these profit-los-
ing ventures off its plate, perhaps  
the A.S. Council and the rest of 
us could then turn our atten-
tion to the issues that truly mat-
ter. After all, though many seem 
to be upset about the loss of  
student management at the Grove, 
we readers still await the Guardian 
article complaining about the lack of 
student management at the Student 
Center that houses the Grove, a 
center that was built by and is 
maintained with self-assessed stu-
dent fees but which has never been 
under the student’s own control.

Housing Threatens Historic Landmark

“UCSD’s complete disregard for this culturally and historically rich site 
reveals a startling 

disconnect ...”

UCSD’s new transfer 
housing, currently 
underway, will block a 
popular flight path for 
La Jolla’s beloved gliders. 



6  OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2007

Instead, the changes seek to stifle 
such expression with countless — and 
senseless — regulations. For example, 
the revision demands that any activ-
ity expected to attract a crowd of 10 
people or more requires a reservation. 
Under this logic, students in a study 
group or some friends grabbing lunch 
would need a permit to do so.

Additionally, these permits could 
be denied if the activity would “unrea-
sonably interfere” with university func-
tions. But such cloudy wording leaves a 
lot of room for interpretation, and with 
university officials already accused of 
abusing this policy and similar existing 
ones — such as citing sound amplifica-
tion policies to remove activists who 
weren’t actually using any such ampli-
fication — a future of authoritarian 
enforcement is only too clear.

Such extreme changes to a docu-
ment that governed campus space 
use effectively for more than 20 years 
deserves to be a topic of open under-
standing and dialogue. Moreover, this 
specific policy governs nearly every 
aspect of outdoor activity and impacts 
every person who passes through 
campus. The document plays such an 
integral role in student life that any 
amendments to it need to be presented  
for all students, faculty and staff to 
discuss. 

But administrators wouldn’t want 
that — then they’d have to admit 
they’ve breached constitutional rights 
with the policy regulations. Freedom 
of speech? Freedom of assembly? 
According to UCSD, the Founding 
Fathers really meant the Bill of Rights 
as a guideline. And according to 
Brainerd, the “right not to listen,” is 
the only right that warrants protect-
ing. (Because people who don’t want 
to listen can’t just walk away.)

Of course there are times that those 
constitutional rights can be sidestepped. 
You can’t yell “Fire!” in a movie the-
ater and you can’t protest the Iraq war 
in someone’s living room. But these 
restrictions make sense — neither is an 
appropriate venue for such actions.

However, in the case of outdoor 
campus forums, there are no better ven-
ues for free expression. Furthermore, 
the policy is vague when it comes to 
enforcement, which allows adminis-
trators to enforce rules loosely and 
how they see fit — potentially targeting 
certain groups or activities.

The potential for abuse and the 
brutal castration of freedom is not 
worth any theoretical gains on behalf 
of “involuntary listeners,” and instead 
foreshadows a dark and dangerous 
future for on-campus student rights.

erable school seemed to me, I logged 
on to TritonLink and dropped all of 
my biology classes. In their place I took 
courses in political science, human 
development, philosophy and psychol-
ogy. In addition, I started working 
for the Guardian and signed up for a 
program to study abroad in Italy. My 
family and friends thought that I was 
pretty insane for redirecting my entire 
life, but in all hon-
esty, it was prob-
ably the best thing 
I could have done 
for myself. 

After experi-
menting with a 
wide variety of 
courses, I’ve settled 
with my new major 
in Environmental 
Systems, which, 
I suppose, is still 
technically a sci-
ence major, but one 
that I enjoy much 
more than the one I had before.  I’ve 
come to terms with the fact that I likely 
won’t graduate in four years as I had 
originally intended, but I figure that 
a couple of quarters longer at UCSD 
with a major that I actually find inter-
esting is not half as bad as going on to 
graduate school or a career in a subject 
that clearly wasn’t right for me. 

One thing I’ve noticed at UCSD 
is that it takes an incredible amount 
of courage for many of us students to 
really think for ourselves and make 
decisions based on how they will affect 
us. This is pretty ridiculous, seeing as 
how one of the reasons we go to college 
is to discover ourselves and the paths 
for which that we are best suited. Our 

futures should never be decided by 
anyone besides ourselves. No matter 
how prestigious a major may seem or 
how many of your friends are enrolled 
in the same classes, or how often your 
mom and dad have told you that they’d 
disown you if you didn’t make it into 
med school, the decision is really up 
to you in the end, not your friends or 
your family. 

Besides, UCSD is not solely a 
science school. 
We’ve got some 
pretty amazing 
psychology, the-
atre, economics 
and political 
science depart-
ments too — not 
to be blown off 
because UCSD 
is overwhelmed 
by science 
majors. 

So, before 
you start study-
ing for the 

MCAT or setting up camp in the 
science and engineering library to 
construct tetrahedral molecules with 
your chemistry kits, just take a few 
minutes to make sure that you’re 
doing it for the right reasons. If 
you aren’t — and this means drop-
ping all of your upper division biol-
ogy classes like I did and spending 
another year at college — don’t feel 
bad. Yes, college is expensive, but 
it’s also fun, and finishing up your 
classes because you think it’s too late 
to change your major is ridiculous. 
It’s never too late, and being trapped 
on a career path that you’re not sure 
you’ll enjoy is not the way to spend 
your life after graduation.

cient. One needs only to look at the 
number of college freshmen with 
sterling scores on their SAT and AP 
exams, who are unable to do well in 
classes that theoretically reflect the 
material they have already learned, 
to see that standardized tests cannot 
be the final word in determining 
academic ability.

Not only do states have varying 
standards of achievement, but states 
lower their standards in order to 
achieve higher scores on state tests. 
When the test scores reflect only 
marginal gains, even in the face of 
lowered standards, claiming that the 
No Child Left Behind Act was a wild 

success falls somewhere between an 
error in judgment and an outright 
lie.

The No Child Left Behind Act 
certainly has some innovative ideas 
for how to improve America’s pub-
lic education system, including let-
ting students transfer out of under-
performing schools and aiming to 
improve the quality of teachers, 
but the focus on standardized test-
ing leaves much to be desired. The 
mediocre results after five years 
under the initiative clearly show that 
more needs to be done to improve 
student achievement, which cannot 
be accomplished merely whitewash-
ing the situation

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK
FOCUS

Most students know about the “Hollywood Ray” buses
that turn up in the faculty parking lot, ready to whisk the under-21 crowd down 

to Mexico for a night of drinking and debauchery — but few know the man 
behind the border-hopping business.

 Following Hollywood Ray to his new club, Coko Bongo, was an exercise 
in endurance and insanity. The man weaves hectically from a bus pickup 
spot to a friend’s house to a gas run, constantly taking calls before he even 
starts to head down to Tijuana for the night, where he will stay until the 
party winds down at 4 a.m. 

Coko Bongo opened Sept. 28, the same night as the annual naughty 
schoolgirl bash, an event that brought 2,000 partygoers and 150,000 
unique visitors to Ray’s Web site the next day. 

It’s easy to see why the college crowd has found its new hotspot. 
Coko Bongo doesn’t fit the typical dirty and rundown model of Tijuana 
clubs. The club is immaculate; workers armed with brooms are constant-

ly patrolling the club and cleaning up after messy drunks. The VIP room 
is filled with trendy model types drinking champagne. Everything is brand 
new and more like Pacific Beach than Safari, a Tijauna club Ray had a stake 
in until a few days ago — a move he said was based on a change in agenda.

“We had totally different ideas on the club; I wanted to invest in it, make 
it nicer and even though my partners said they wanted to fix it up too, it 

never happened,” Ray said.
Despite the break, he said there is no bad blood between himself 

and his old partners. But even with the good relations, he can’t help 
gloating when Safari looks dead on a Friday night.

“All the cabs go to Coko Bongo now, no one goes [to Safari] 
anymore,” Ray said.

A born promoter, he wants more events and concerts to 
attract the crowd. On Oct. 5, Girls Gone Wild was at the club 

filming and handing out free shirts to a screaming crowd. 
A hot-girl contest with $100 and a bottle of tequila on the 
line turned R-rated when a largely male crowd started 
chanting “show your tits” to a stage of dancing girls, 
they complied; Ray knows how to keep his customers 
entertained.

He has been in the party scene since before he 
could get into clubs. Born in San Jose, Calif., the pro-
moter got his start at age 14, handing out flyers for par-

ties thrown by his older surfer friends. Soon he began 
throwing house parties, promoting bands and busing 

Hollywood Ray, Tijuana’s head honcho, shows how he runs the party scene south of the border.

Local Impact • National Inﬂ uence • Global Reach

UC San Diego, ranked the 8th best public university in the 
nation, is the ﬁ rst in the region to top one billion dollars in 
a fundraising campaign. Gifts from generous donors are 
impacting San Diego and the world by funding cutting-
edge research, advancing patient care, recruiting stellar 
faculty, supporting student access to education and training 
tomorrow’s leaders.

Thank you to the 100,000 alumni, parents, faculty, 
staff, students and friends who helped UCSD raise 
an unprecedented $1 billion from July 2000 through 
June 2007.

I t was just over a year ago when the A.S. Council launched its newest programming brainchild, a simple 
500-person event with two main attrac-
tions: beer and games.

But the formula of the campus’ Bear 
Gardens is more complex in retrospect; 
the event faced a host of odds at its 
inception last year, only to flourish into 
one of the university’s fastest grow-
ing crowd-drawers. Along the way, the 
Bear Garden has been relied on as one 
of the few regularly-hosted all-campus 
events, garnering praise from attendees 
— administrators, students and staff 
alike — for its ability to bond, connect 
and link subsections of campus.

The Bear Garden met its inau-
gural fanfare Oct. 20, 2006, when 
kinks abounded for the hosting A.S. 
Programming department: The event 
began 40 minutes late, nearby parking 
availability was slim and, perhaps the 
biggest thorn, councilmembers were 
unable to publicize the occasion to 
their liking. The cornerstone of council 
publicity was based on the event’s sale 
of alcohol, in addition to the presence 
of carnival-style games and music. But 
as a part of university policy, advertise-
ments for campus events are barred 
from alcohol-sale promotion. 

“The policy and regulation exist in 
order to moderate the emphasis on and 
abuse of alcohol by students,” former 
Vice Chancellor Joseph W. Watson said 
at the time. “Alcohol should not be the 
principal reason why students attend an 
event sponsored by the university.”

And so the moniker “Bear Garden” 
was born. Keeping one letter away from 
policy infraction was effectively “hiding 
the fact that there is going to be alcohol 
at the event,” former A.S. President 
Harry Khanna said. Khanna, along 
with fellow councilmembers, expect-
ed the campus policy to paralyze any 
hopes for development.

But what’s in a name? Even though 
the event has moved from site to site 
over the past year, and in fact has never 
been hosted under Warren College’s 
“Bear” monument, the size of groups 
flocking to Bear Gardens has ramped 
up. The event’s foremost quality is 
something more intangible, former A.S. 
Commissioner of Programming Di Lam 
said: “[I] think that as this event builds 
a better and stronger tradition over the 
next year, attendance will most definite-
ly increase despite the existing policy.” 
Lam’s forecast was onpoint; the first Bear 
Garden drew 447 students, with every 
following Bear Garden drawing higher 
numbers. The Bear Garden’s “success-
ful recipe” of community-building and 
interactivity, Assistant Vice Chancellor 
of Student Life Gary R. Ratcliff said, 
“seems to attract 100 to 200 more stu-
dents than the last event.”

The Bear Garden was originally 
conceived as a reincarnation of “TGIF,” 
one of UCSD’s longest-standing pro-
grams. But university officials realized 
the need to support a new breed of pro-
gramming, one that was both realistic 
and left room for growth.

“[A.S. Programming] didn’t want to 
just recreate the past, because as a cam-
pus we are not what we once were ... 
that is to say a small and young univer-
sity,” University Events Office Director 
Martin Wollesen said. “As the campus 
has grown there is a greater need to 
find ways of connecting, and the Bear 
Gardens were one way to address that.”

The progress of the Bear Garden 
may signify a shift in the programming 
department’s attention. Large-scale, 
one-time events such as WinterFest, 
FallFest and Sun God Festival have 
remained the division’s heaviest affairs 
in money and manpower, but the 
Bear Garden now claims a chunk of 
the department’s agenda; the 2007-08 
A.S. Council budget allots $40,000 to 

this year’s six planned Bear Gardens, 
$10,000 more than WinterFest. The 
hotter spotlight may be warranted, as 
Bear Gardens offer a different taste to 
the department apart from its normal 
battery of concerts, Wollesen said. 

“We and the A.S. Programming stu-
dents are always looking for a way to 
bring students together,” Wollesen said. 
“Concerts are of course one way, but 
the Bear Gardens offer a low-key, social 
atmosphere for students from across 
the campus to get together.”

At the Oct. 5 Bear Garden, entrance 
lines wound around Sun God Lawn. 
The picture is familiar for the often-
overcrowded event, where some attend-
ees wait for over an hour to enter. The 
culprit may be partly the transitory 
location; the second Bear Garden this 
quarter will be held at Matthews Quad 
across from Price Center.

“A consistent location makes the 
event easier to organize and helps with 
marketing,” Ratcliff said. The event 
itself, he joked, was assuming a bear’s 
migratory habits, “moving from region 
to region of the campus.”

Administrative binds over the Bear 
Garden may relax soon. Security pres-
ence, Ratcliff said, may be the first to 
see downsizing.

“[A] ratio of security to attendees has 
existed for past Bear Gardens,” Ratcliff 
said. “However, since the events have 
proven to be mellow, I think it is rea-
sonable to shrink the security levels; it 
would reduce the expense of organizing 
the program.”

A Fast for the Body, a Feast for the Soul
I remember Ramadan for the street life more than anything, which was the lanterns outside a lot of the shops 
and buildings, the little streamer deco-
rations that they have out,” said Aisha 
Saad, a semester-long study abroad 
student at the American University of 
Cairo, as she remi-
nisced about the 
Egypt of her youth 
while resting in a 
campus courtyard. 
“In the evenings, 
little kids going 
around with the 
little lanterns,” 

Raised in Egypt until the age of six 
and transplanted to Greenville, North 
Carolina, Saad grew into a devout 
Muslim. Embracing her first Ramadan 
as an adult in Egypt, her experience of 
the culture mixed both foreign awe and 
native understanding, creating a unique 
and insightful perspective on a facet of 
Muslim life in Egypt many exchange 
students can only touch on. 

Ramadan, the most holy month of 
the Islamic lunar calendar, falls between 
Sept. 13 and Oct. 12 this year.

“A lot of people see Ramadan as just 
the physical fast … a month long, sun-
rise to sunset, abstaining from food and 
drink,” Saad said. “The other compo-
nent to the fast is also the spiritual fast, 
so it’s supposed to be abstaining from 
bad thoughts or treating people in a 
bad way. There’s a character component 
to it as well.”

As a child, Saad was eager to partici-
pate, and fasting marked the transition. 
While most children wait until age 10 or 
11, Saad started early. 

“I fasted my first full Ramadan when 
I was eight,” she said with a laugh neatly 
framed by a chic, soft-pink- and gray-
striped hijab. “I remember how hard it 
was and how grown up I felt.”

Despite exemptions, children, preg-
nant women, diabetics, the ill and trav-
elers are rarely seen eating publicly. 
Fewer shops are open, and most restau-
rants close their doors from sunup to 

sundown, while those that remain open 
shade their windows.

Cairo’s streets still emit a constant 
stream of noise; people still go about 
with their work through hunger and 
thirst. Ramadan is more than religious 
— it is cultural, and many living in the 

country fast only by 
default. 

Ben Barclay, 
studying at AUC 
for one semester 
fasted not by default 
but by choice. He 
spent one week of 
Ramadan fasting in  

an attempt to further submerge himself 
in the culture.

“Many students,” said Barclay, 
“including myself, study abroad with 
the intention of cultural immersion. 
And Islam is such a pervasive force 
in Egypt that it can’t really be severed 
from Egyptian culture. I wanted to 
personally experience the challenges of 
the fast as a method of cultural explora-
tion, but I also wanted to foster some 
sense of solidarity with the people with 
whom I had surrounded myself.”

Barclay fasted not only for himself; 
he also attempted to bridge cultures 
among family and friends by blogging 
about his time in Egypt. 

He thought it was important to dis-
cuss Ramadan in particular on his blog 
because “it serves as a conduit to my 
friends and family in the West, where 
Ramadan is generally overlooked,” he 
said. “Additionally, more often than not 
(at least in the Midwest), Muslim piety 
is mistaken for militant fundamental-
ism. By writing about my participation 
in the Ramadan fast, as well as depict-
ing its overwhelmingly festive nature, 
I hope to offer a view of Islam and 
Muslim culture that is contrary to the 
mainstream portrayal.”

One image of Ramadan for students 
and foreigners here is an increase of 
beggars around the city who man the

people to clubs. The rest is Avenida 
Revolución history.

According to Ray, he recieved his 
infamous moniker from the band 
Alien Ant Farm when he was doing 
promotional work for them. The 
band told him he had a style straight 
out of Hollywood, and the name and 
persona stuck with him since then.

Although he drives downtown 
and to Pacific Beach, the majority 
of his business is in driving under-
graduates to Tijuana. Anywhere 
from 1,500 to 3,000 college students 
head across the border in Ray’s buses 
every weekend. He estimated that up 
to 90 percent of his customers are 
under 21. Until recently, San Diego 
State made up the majority of his 
business, but he said recently UCSD 
has caught up.

Though everyone has heard 
horror stories of good times gone 
wrong down in Mexico, Ray scoffed 
at claims of the Mexican police’s mis-
treatment of American students and 
insisted he hasn’t heard of anything 
terrible happening.

Ray is friendly with Tijuana’s law 
enforcement. He often calls a cop’s 
cell phone to see if he is on duty to 
provide an escort; even the fede-
rales came out to his VIP section. 
Running a new club in Tijuana is a 
high-profile endeavor that attracts 

attention from local government 
officials, and he is careful to stay in 
their good graces.

Besides the party buses and his 
new club Coko Bongo, Ray operates 
an air conditioning and heating busi-
ness during the week. His packed 
schedule and expert multitasking is 
evident as he takes pictures of people 
dancing and answers nonstop calls 
between conversations. Even with 
the frantic pace and late nights, Ray 
is nothing if not calm and collected 
— a businessman in his natural habi-
tat.

For anyone who has been to clubs 
on Avenida Revolución, the strip 
in Tijuana where most American 
students end up, the scene inside 
Coko Bongo is familiar. The relent-
less tequila man, pushy bathroom 
attendant and wasted sorority girls 
are ever present. The alcohol inevi-
tably gets a few eager clubgoers too 
drunk to catch the bus home, but 
Ray tries makes sure everyone gets 
a ride home. 

“I’ll go out of my way and take 
people home myself,” he said.

Even with his extreme popularity 
among San Diego college students, 
some still criticize how he makes 
his living.

“I think the violence and drug 
abuse in Tijuana comes from the 
disregard for the humanity and life 

in general in Tijuana,” Earl Warren 
College junior Yesenia Padilla said. 
“I think bussing college students 
anywhere for the express purpose 
of debauchery is deplorable, you 
wouldn’t want that in your back-
yard.”  

But according to Ray, his position 
can’t be pigeonholed as simply an 
American businessman abusing the 
unequal border. His father is from a 
small town in Mexico, where he has 
spent time throughout his life. He 
also speaks Spanish well enough to 
pass as a native and sees his business 
as helping, not hurting, the system.

“I bring money into the country,” 
Ray said. “Of course I want things to 
improve.”

Waiting in line at the border, Ray 
spoke angrily about the divide, sug-
gesting the border is illegal and only 
in place to isolate the increasingly 
business-savvy Mexicans.

His night ends after the last bus 
leaves the border. Drunk phone 
calls come in incessantly from rid-
ers unable to find the overpass that 
will take them home. He takes all 
the calls, not trusting anyone else 
to make sure the kids make it back 
safety. 

Despite getting home at sunrise 
when people go out for their morn-
ing runs, Ray has no regrets.

“I love what I do,” he said.

sidewalks throughout the day and par-
ticipate in street-side sunset feasts, or 
iftaars — the breaking of fast at sunset.

“Here you have a part of the 
[Ramadan] street life, they’re called 
Ma’ida Al-Rahman, the tables of mercy,” 
said Saad. “Those are funded by private 
donors or by mosque communities, 
sometimes restaurant establishments 
and those are to provide iftaar specifi-
cally for the poor.”

Another Ramadan icon is the 
increased prominence of the call to 
prayer. From the high vantage point 
of Azhar park in Islamic Cairo, the 
prayers of the city, called out from 
each mosque minaret, can be heard as 
one chant — drowning each other out, 
complementing and confusing each 
other and pouring across the city at 
dusk as the last light trickles beyond 
the horizon.

The sound begins and breaks quick-
ly in the evenings, calling for the iftaar 
feast, and picks up again to mark the 
fifth prayer and the night prayer.

“I remember the night prayers, the 
taraweeh prayers, which are pretty icon-
ic of Ramadan as well, because those 
are two to three hours long depending 
on where you go, and it’s a huge congre-
gation,” Saad said, having spent several 
hours the previous night at a taraweeh 
prayer with her cousins. “It’s a regular 

practice … to have the taraweeh prayers 
in the evenings after the fifth prayer, 
which is isha, and most sheiks, the ones 
who recite or who lead the prayer, try to 
finish with recitation of the Koran over 
the month of Ramadan.”

According to Saad, even the people 
who don’t regularly attend congrega-
tional prayer at the mosques do go to 
taraweeh.

“There’s almost a cultural compo-
nent to it other than just religion,” said 
Saad.

Despite the extrinsic differences, 
Saad maintains the belief that Ramadan 
is largely a personal event but explained 
how the community affects the per-
sonal experience of the fast.

“It’s more moralizing that you have 
a lot of the surrounding community 
also participating.” Saad said. “It makes 
it easier to participate beyond the phys-
ical fast when in Cairo. The not eating, 
not drinking feels exactly the same, but 
having opportunities to attend differ-
ent events or … exercise the spiritual 
part of it, [is] definitely easier here, just 
because everybody else is making an 
effort to do it.”

While many people might assume 
Ramadan is celebrated differently in 
a Muslim country, both the U.S. and 
Egypt are similar in their practices.

Witnessing 
the End of a 

Dynasty
In  my last column, I wrote about giving the San Diego sports scene a chance, especially the Triton 
teams that fight valiantly with some 
of the best teams in the country and 
entertain the student body with gritty 
play.

Well, this past weekend, I ditched 
my own advice and accepted an invi-
tation to see, as my friend from the 
University of Southern California 
said, “real college sports.” He told me 
to come catch the Trojans annihilate a 
pitiful Pac-10 opponent, the Stanford 
Cardinal. So I ventured north to soak 
in the action of a top-ranked Division 
I football program and enjoy the 
campus social scene that takes place 
every Saturday USC’s beloved Trojans 
play — and always win, in front of 
the Southern California faithful and 
some token bandwagon-jumpers. 

When I arrived, I was immediately 
impressed and caught up in the pre-
game debauchery, which took place 
on a lively stretch of campus that 
seemed like a tailgater’s paradise: kegs 

Injuries Can’t Halt Unbeaten Streak

By Jake Blanc
Staff Writer

The 2007 UCSD women’s soccer 
team rose to the upper echelons of 
collegiate soccer this year on the sheer 
talent of 
their start-
ing lineup. 
Their nor-
mal recipe 
for first-
half success will now have to be modi-
fied, with injuries mounting up on 
their starting squad. To maintain the 
status of their No. 4 national ranking in 
the nation throughout the second half 
of the season, the Tritons will have to 
depend on the depth and versatility of 
their bench.

On Oct. 6, the newly structured 
lineup was tested for the first time as 
UCSD traveled up north for a confer-
ence game against Humboldt State. The 
Tritons not only were putting forward 
an unusual front line, but they also 
had to do so after a 10-day break from 
play. The team did nothing but practice 
against themselves ever since a 2-1 vic-
tory against Cal State Los Angeles on 
Sept. 23.

The long hiatus proved imma-
terial, with UCSD posting a quality 
2-0 win over in-conference rival the 
Lumberjacks. The team’s new makeup 
followed the patterns of the first-half 
team almost perfectly: scoring early 

and displaying a tight-fisted defense. 
Senior midfielder Ali Lai notched both 
of the Triton goals early in the first half, 
and UCSD’s impenetrable defense did 
the rest to secure yet another win and 
preserve the team’s unbeaten record 
at 9-0-1 (6-0-1 California Collegiate 
Athletic Association). 

For Lai, scoring twice at the onset 

of the game was great, but it had its 
downsides.

“It definitely took a lot of pressure 
off the team early on,” Lai said. “Being 
up two goals so early in the game was 
crucial. At the same time it was almost 
a bad thing, too, because we got too 
comfortable and relaxed. The two goals 
made us feel like we had the game in 

the bag, which allowed Humboldt to 
actually get back in the game a bit.”

The problem of first-half scoring 
has haunted the Tritons all season. 
Granted, scoring too much in the first 
90 minutes is a good sort of problem 
to have, but the Tritons realized the

After downing the Cal State 
Monterey Bay Otters in straight sets 
on Oct. 4, the No. 21 UCSD women’s 
volleyball team couldn’t finish the 
weekend sweep, falling to Sonoma 
State on Oct. 5 to arrive at their cur-
rent 11-6 overall record, including 
a 5-4 mark in California Collegiate 
Athletics Association play.

The Tritons hoped to gain a bit 
more momentum heading into the 
big matchup against CSULA, but 
they are still focused on their posi-
tive play.

“I thought we hit at a pretty high 
level,” head coach Tom Black said. 
“We had multiple hitting errors, but 
we take it one match at a time.”

Junior outside hitter Rebecca 
Bailey powered the Tritons to 
a straight set win over Cal State 
Monterey Bay, 30-18, 31-29, 30-22. 
Bailey pounded out 15 kills, with 
sophomore middle blocker Sylvia 
Schmidt adding 12 and senior oppo-
site Amber Ries tallying 10.

As captain, Bailey holds herself 
to a higher standard because she 
feels she must lead by example.

“After every game that we lose 
or win, I re-analyze how I played 
and reacted and how it affected the 
team,” she said. “As captains, we are 
held accountable for the team’s suc-
cess and downfalls so we’re always 
critiquing ourselves looking back 
wondering what we could’ve done 
better.”

The first was only the warmup 
for what would be an incredible sec-
ond game. The Tritons and Otters 
battled back and forth, with nei-
ther team gaining much of an edge.

Struggles at home continued for 
the No. 12 UCSD men’s water polo 
team as the Tritons took two tough 
home losses over the weekend. UCSD 
lost to No. 8 UC Santa Barbara by a 
score of 13-10 on Oct. 5, and dropped 
another close contest to No. 7 Long 
Beach State by a score of 12-10 on Oct. 
6. The two losses drop UCSD’s record 
to 9-8, including a surprising 2-5 mark 
in home games, where the Tritons have 
lost five straight games after opening 
the season with two home wins. 

The Tritons started out well against 
Long Beach State, with sophomore 
two-meter Daniel Garcia scoring on 
the first UCSD possession to take an 
early lead. The 49ers quickly answered 
with three straight goals, aided by a 
UCSD ejection as well as a five-meter 
penalty shot. 

The Tritons scored on their first 

possession of the second quarter as 
well, with sophomore two-meter 
defender Steven Donohoe scoring 
another UCSD six-on-five goal to tie 
the game at three. UCSD’s transition 
defense struggled, unable to stop Long 
Beach State’s two counterattack goals 
that made their lead 5-3.   

Garcia added another goal before 
halftime, but defensive mistakes by the 
Tritons allowed Long Beach State to 
take an 8-4 lead going into the inter-
mission. 

“We had a soft first half of the game 
with not a lot of intensity,” junior utility 
Sidd Menon said. 

The Tritons picked up their inten-
sity in the second half, playing tighter 
defense and capitalizing on Long Beach 
State’s defensive mistakes. Sophomore 
utility Sean Roberts opened the scor-
ing in the second half with a six-on-
five goal for the Tritons. Donohoe

Men’s Soccer Plays to Tie 
Against Humboldt State

By Joo Yoon
Staff Writer

The UCSD men’s soccer team 
began its push to make the playoffs 
on Oct. 5 at Humboldt State after 
announcing last week that it’s going 
forward with a new slate under a new 
coach. In their first of eight straight 
games against California Collegiate 
Athletic Association opponents, 
the Tritons played to a scoreless tie 
against the Lumberjacks. The tie was 
the team’s second after double over-
time this season, putting its overall 
record to 2-7-2 and 1-4-2 in CCAA 
play. 

The Tritons were once again 
plagued by missed opportunities, 
shooting eight times but making only 
two shots on goal. Interim head coach 
Paul Holohan was once again pleased 
with the team’s effort, but lamented 
the team’s missed chances. 

“The boys played very, very well,” 
Holohan said. “It was a very good 
effort. To be honest, we should have 
won the game. We just couldn’t con-
vert on some really good opportuni-
ties in the first half and overtime.”

Senior captain Josh Levy said he 
believed the tie was a good start to 
their push but agreed it could have 
been better.

“I think it was a pretty good start,” 
Levy said. “We played pretty well but 
obviously we would have preferred a 
win over a tie, but a tie is better than 
a loss. We are still in the running, but 
we need a tie or a win against Sonoma 
State.”

With the return of starting junior 
goalkeeper Peter Akman, the Tritons 
managed to hold Humboldt State’s 
offense in check. Akman, who did not 
play during the crucial trip against 
Seattle University and Seattle Pacific 
University upon receiving a red card, 

came back with a vengeance, saving 
seven shots to record his second shut-
out of the season.

Levy praised Akman for returning 
and providing a boost for the team.

“He played really well,” Levy said. 
“He really saved a shot that should 
have been a goal and a shutout is 
always good. If he doesn’t allow any 
goals, it means we aren’t going to 
lose.”

Holohan summed up Akman’s 
performance in just one word: 
“Excellent.” 

Despite the draw, the fact remains 
that the Triton offense still has to gen-
erate some goals if the team wants to 
make a push for the playoffs. 

Having said last week that he felt 
the missed chances were due to a 
lack of experience, Levy still could 
not pinpoint a particular reason as to 
why the offense has been sputtering 
all season. 

“I definitely think we will get 
ourselves together before the season 
is over,” Levy said. “We just need 
to finish because everything else is 
there. It’s hard to explain. I would 
say we would get around the goal 
and just not finish our chances; 
if we can finish that we can win 
games.”

With seven games left, the Tritons 
still have an opportunity to make the 
playoffs if their offense improves. 
Holohan said the team’s goal now is 
score as many points as possible.

“You have to get as many points 
as you can in the bag,” Holohan 
said. “We’re actually creating some 
great opportunities. We aren’t allow-
ing many goals and getting many 
chances on the other end. We’re 
really going to make a strong push. 
We still have seven games left, that’s 
21 points potentially, and that’s a lot 
of points to play for.”

Monterey Bay was only one point 
away from taking game two.

That’s where the Tritons went on 
a four-point run that killed the Otter 
spirit and won game two 31-29.

“We just crawled it out,” Black 
said. “We kept our composure and 
won the game in an ugly way.”

UCSD would go on to take 
game three and the match, stretch-
ing UCSD’s streak to three heading 
into the game against Sonoma State, 
which was coming off an upset of 
No. 16 CSU Los Angeles.

“We knew [Sonoma State] had 
beaten [Cal State Los Angeles] but 
we kept our focus,” Bailey said. 
“If we’re not ready to play in this 
league, any team can jump on you. 
We know every team is tough, and 
so we go into every game knowing 
we have to play well.”

The Tritons fell to the same fate 

as their fellow CCAA competitor, 
falling 30-20, 26-30, 30-26, 30-24. 

In game one, Sonoma State got  
started quickly, taking a 10-3 lead. 
The Tritons never appeared to have 
it together, as the Seawolves would 
take a 20-9 advantage before they 
came away with the victory.

UCSD seemed to get back on 
track in game two, garnering an 18-
12 lead before Sonoma State battled 
back to within three. Schmidt would 
put the game away with one of her 
15 kills.

With the score tied up at 8-8 in 
game three, the Seawolves would 
take off on a 10-point run that 
would all but end UCSD’s hope of 
a game three victory. That long run 
was largely made possible by a series 
of Triton errors.

“I think [unforced errors] were 
the reason we lost,” Black said. 
“[Sonoma State] came out strong 

and serving tough but we did what 
we wanted on serve receive. We just 
didn’t execute.” 

The Tritons wouldn’t go quietly 
though, as they chipped away with 
a five-point run of their own, but 
the errors proved too much to over-
come.

Battling to force a decisive game 
five, the Tritons jumped out to an 
11-9 lead. The teams were tied 20-
20 when Sonoma State rattled off 
three straight points, two on UCSD 
errors. Bailey recorded one of her 19 
kills to pull UCSD within one, but 
Sonoma State went on a 6-1 run to 
close out the game.

“We weren’t connecting tonight,” 
Bailey said. “We got a little rattled 
for no good reason, and we should’ve 
been able to break them. But we’re a 
team that doesn’t let the past dictate 
how we play in the future so we’ll be 
ready for this week.”

added another six-on-five goal and a 
five-meter penalty goal in the quar-
ter. The 49ers closed the quarter with 
another counterattack score, extending 
their lead to 11-7. 

UCSD played well in the fourth 
quarter, cutting the Long Beach State 
lead to 12-10 with less than two min-
utes left in the game. The Tritons had 
another six-on-five opportunity to pull 
within one goal of the 49ers but UCSD 
was unable to convert, sealing the win 
for Long Beach State. 

UCSD struggled in the goal with 
freshmen goalkeepers Mark Stemler 
and Adam Rule each playing one half 
of the game.

“Myself and our other goalkeeper 
[Rule] didn’t play our best,” Stemler 
said. “We missed some shots that we 
should have gotten.”

The Tritons played another tough 

game against a ranked opponent on 
Oct. 5 as they hosted UCSB, a team 
that they had suffered a 10-8 loss to 
earlier in the season. The two teams 
played a very tight game for the first 
half with strong play from Stemler, 
who returned from injury to start the 
game. 

The Tritons played effective 
defense, stealing the ball from UCSB’s 
two-meter with consistency and dis-
rupting the Gaucho offense in the first 
half. With three minutes left in the first 
half, Garcia scored one of his three 
first-half goals to give UCSD a 4-3 
lead. UCSB answered back with two 
goals to enter halftime with their first 
lead of the game.

The Tritons continued strong play 
in the second half with many key 
blocks from Stemler and goals from 
Donohoe, Garcia, sophomore util-
ity Peter Gresham and senior driver 

Curtis Williamson. With four min-
utes left in the game and UCSB lead-
ing 12-10, the Tritons had a golden 
opportunity to close the gap with two 
straight five-meter penalty shots. But 
they were unable to score on either 
five-meter shot and the Gauchos 
scored an easy counterattack goal 
to win the game by a final score of 
13-10. 

Even though the Tritons suffered 
the loss to UCSB, the UCSD players 
thought they did well against a tough 
opponent for most of the game. 

“We played pretty well,” Stemler 
said. “It was one of the better games 
that we played this year. We did 
everything we were supposed to.” 

The Tritons will face another 
tough team at the Southern California 
Tournament in Irvine as they open 
the event against No. 6 UC Irvine on 
Oct. 13.

in the street, “victory dogs” being sold 
prematurely and Reggie Bush jersey-
clad fans tossing footballs back and 
forth. Hand-in-hand with the alcool 
consumption was the inevitable shit-
talking: belligerent Trojan students 
debated whether John David Booty 
would throw four touchdown passes 
or more and whether the Cardinal 
could even manage to score more 
than a field goal.

Well, as anybody who follows 
college football, 
or catches the 2 
a.m. SportsCenter, 
already knows, 
Booty threw four 
interceptions — 
not touchdowns. 
And Stanford 
scored much 
more than a field 
goal, including 
a game-winning 
touchdown pass 
with 49 seconds 
remaining in front 
of over 85,000 
stunned fans who 
came to the Los 
Angeles Memorial 
Coliseum expect-
ing nothing less than a blowout win. 
You can’t blame the fans for expecting 
big things; some Las Vegas oddsmak-
ers had the Trojans as a 40-point 
favorite.

So what happened? As a nonaffili-
ated casual fan, I had a great perspec-
tive sitting in the USC student section 
listening to the fans rationalize the 
collapse in an attempt to keep the 
faith.

“We’re a second-half team; we’ll 
bounce back.” Or “we always play 
better against good opponents, so 
we’re just not trying hard because it’s 
Stanford.”

Well, maybe head coach Pete 

Carroll and his smorgasbord of tal-
ented and versatile tailbacks and 
receivers should have taken the 
Cardinal a little more seriously, as the 
once-proud dynasty of USC football 
has to now deal with the shame of 
losing to the worst team in the Pac-10 
— a team whose offense was forced 
to start with its backup quarterback 
after the usual starter suffered a sei-
zure earlier this week, and who lost to 
D-I AA UC Davis just two years ago.

The worst part of USC’s down-
fall is that the 
Trojans basically 
handed Stanford 
chance after 
chance to pull 
off the upset, 
arguably the big-
gest in college 
football history. 
The one-point 
differential in 
the 24-23 final 
score was due to 
a blocked extra-
point attempt in 
the first quar-
ter. Despite the 
mistake, no one 
thought it would 
come back to 

haunt the Trojans, whose offense is 
so powerful that the team usually 
scores at least 30 points easily. Well, 
it did come back to haunt them, after 
USC allowed Stanford to hang in with 
dropped passes, lackluster play-call-
ing and Booty handing the Cardinal 
interceptions on silver platters.

Then came the final touchdown, 
which took place in the corner of the 
end zone right in front of where I 
was sitting with my shocked friends. 
These friends of mine, seniors who 
had witnessed some great teams dur-
ing their college tenure, were speech-

less, as Stanford capitalized on anoth-
er Booty interception and promptly 
converted a fourth-and-20 to set up 
first-and-goal at USC’s nine-yard 
line. Stanford then moved back a 
yard in three plays to set up fourth-
and-and goal from the 10 with under 
a minute remaining.

Thanks to perfect execution from 
backup quarterback Tavita Pritchard 
and wide receiver Mark Bradford, 
Stanford tied the game as Bradford 
leaped high over cornerback Mozique 
McCurtis to haul in the score. And 
unlike USC’s earlier attempt, Stanford 
converted the point after touchdown 
to complete the comeback.

Amazingly, the Trojans still had 
a chance to rebound and salvage a 
slim win if they could move down-
field in the 40-odd seconds left and 
kick a game-winning field goal. 
Unfortunately for the Trojans, the 
pressure again fell on Booty and the 
USC offense, which blew another 
chance, as top receiver Patrick Turner 
dropped an easy pass and Booty made 
the upset official, throwing his fourth 
interception of the game.

The once-raucous crowd fell sud-
denly silent, depressed and pissed 
off all at the same time, forced to 
debate who to blame. To understand 
the shock, one must realize that my 
friends and the rest of the young stu-
dent body had previously been lucky 
enough to have never seen their 
beloved team lose at home. USC had 
won 35-straight home games until 
this historic upset.

My Trojan friends were devastat-
ed and stunned after the game; I was 
stunned as well, but also felt hon-
ored to have witnessed something 
much more rare than seeing what I 
thought was one of the best teams in 
college football destroy a conference 
opponent. I saw something that USC 
fans hadn’t seen in six years, and it 
will stick with me as one of the most 
memorable sporting events I’ve ever 
been present for.

WILL PARSON/GUARDIAN
The Tritons got their second win of their road trip on Oct. 7, a 1-0 victory against Sonoma State, thanks 
to a game-winning goal by senior midfielder Chelsey Campbell, improving their CCAA record to 7-0-1. 

importance of holding the intensity for 
the whole game.

“We come out pretty hard every 
game and get some quick goals,” junior 
forward Natasha Belak-Berger said. “It 
seems like in the second half we just 
try to settle down and keep possession 
of the ball.”

Another bright spot in the win was 
the return of senior forward Kathy 
Sepulveda, who had been out since 
breaking her arm in the season’s open-
ing match. Sepulveda’s return could not 
have come at a more opportune time: 
For a team succumbing to injuries, 
regaining their a veteran leader was 
unbelievably important.

“Having Kathy back, that was big,” 
head coach Brian McManus said. “It 
really helped to get a big weight off 
the front. It put a lot of pressure on the 
opposing defenders and also took some 
pressure off Lai up front. Belak-Berger 
was able to drop down between mid-
field and forward, which helped a lot.”

McManus reiterated the importance 
of avoiding injuries and picking up any 
slack that may develop.

“Trying to get healthy is going to be 
a definite key throughout the season,” 
McManus said. “We have had way too 

many injuries this year. We had to use 
14 players against Humboldt.”

McManus also expressed concern 
over the loss of other players. Junior 
midfielder Amanda Esquivel will not 
be with the team next week as she is 
playing for the Costa Rican national 
team in the Olympic qualifiers. 

While the losses are detrimental, 
McManus expects the return of injured 
sophomore midfielder Alexia Zatarain 
“soon enough.”

The players are equally aware of the 
challenges of adapting to the shifting 
lineup.

“We need to pull together as a team 
right now,” Lai said. “We’re short as a 
team, which means that the healthy 
players need to realize how crucial they 
are now. We don’t have a lot of bench 
players now, so everyone really has to 
step it up.”

This small but relatively significant 
challenge will be a good test for the 
2007 squad. And if they can perse-
vere through this stretch, it could bond 
them as a stronger, more resilient team. 
It is fitting that the Tritons, who have 
faced seemingly little opposition this 
season, will now have to face off against 
themselves as the most difficult chal-
lenge to date.

man William Burroughs

of Trash.” Focusing in 
on Waters’ early nega-
tive artistic influences

and the extremes of the contemporary art world, this joyously devious 
monologue elevates all that is trashy in life into a call to arms to “filth 
followers” everywhere. Tickets available online at 10% OFF For UCSD 
Faculty and Staff, $36 (regular $42). Purchase online at : http://www.
