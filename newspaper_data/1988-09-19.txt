A.S. President 
Fires UCSA Rep 
Vaughn Rex charges 'misuse of power' 

By ERIC CHAZANKIN 
Staff Writer 

Vaughn Rex, the UCSD repre-
sentative to the University of 
California Student Association 
(UCSA), was "relieved of his 
responsibilities" by ASUCSD 
President Maynard Dimmesdale 
following a conflict as to w~om 
UCSD would support for the 
position of UCSA president. 

The action occurred at the 
Aug. 5-7 UCSA meeting at UC 
Davis. Two candidates for UCSA 
President, Tisa Poe of UC Berke-
ley and Tracey Woodruff of UC 
San Francisco, were interviewed 
by the delegates to the meeting, 
which included Dimmesdale, Rex, 
and ASUCSD Vice President 
External Mordecai Potash. 

The conflict occurred when 
Dimmesdale directed Rex to cast 

UCSD's vote for Poe, and Rex 
refused. 

"We were convinced of who we 
really wanted to have for Presi-
dent," Dimmesdale said, referring 
to himself and Potash. "Vaughn 
was not at all convinced." 

"The responsibility of the 
UCSA representative is to repre-
sent the wishes of the President," 
he continued. When in Dimmes-
dale's view, Rex failed to do this, 
"he was relieved from the respon-
sibilities of his position." 

"If we have a representattve, he 
would have to be really on top of 
things. Vaughn doesn't have that 
ability," Dimmesdale said . Fol-
lowing the conflict, "We felt that 
it would be in our best interests to 
let go of Vaughn," he explained. 

"If you want a puppet, you 
have the wrong person for the 
job," Rex responded. He de-

Regents OK Architecture School for UCSD 
By ERIC CHAZANKIN 
Staff Writer 

A new UCSD school of archi-
tecture, to include both graduate 
and undergraduate offerings, was 
approved on Friday by the UC 
Regents at the end of a two-day 
meeting in San Francisco. 

"The Regents' approval of the 
School of Architecture is a major 
event for the campus," UCSD 
Chancellor Richard Atkinson said 
in a release. "... we expect to 
recruit a faculty that will make 
this one of the top architectural 
schools in the world," he added. 

The next step in the formation 
of the school will be the selection 
of a dean followed by recruitment 
offaculty. This process is expected 
to take at least two years. "The 
earliest we would be teaching stu-
dents ... would be 90-91," Gradu-
ate Studies Dean Richard Attiyeh 
said. 

Although the form of the 
school's affiliation with UCSD 
will be similar to the Graduate 
School of International Relations 
and Pacific Rim Studies, the 
school of architecture will offer a 
major in architecture to under-
graduates enrolled at any of 
UCSD's colleges. The school will 
also offer a professional master's 
degree, and a small Ph.D. 
program. 

The school will probably have 
to wait a few years for it's own 
facilitie ; "The idea is that the 

school would be located in exist-
ing facilities until a new building 
could be built. 

The present architectural fla-
vor of UCSD has sometimes been 
criticized in the past. Regarding 
how the school of architecture 
will fit in to the overall UCSD 
environment, Attiyeh feels that 
"It would raise the level of archi-
tectural thinking and discussion" 

at UCSD. 
He also sees a school of archi-

tecture here as providing "sub-
stantial benefit to the UCSD 
community," as a center of 
research, architectural ideas, and 

·as a resource for local architectu-
ral professionals. 

"There has been a great deal ot 
interest by the San Diego archi-

tectural community. It will be a 
school which will substantially 
broaden the campus educational 
enterprise," UCSD Vice Chancel-
lor of Academic Affairs Harold 
Ticho said in a release. 

According to Attiyeh, the idea 
of a school of architecture at 
UCSD "goes back at least 20 
years." "It had been widely dis-
cussed" in the past, but due to 

fiscal and other considerations, 
"it was put on the back burner for 
a while," he added. 

The idea was resurrected when 
Ticho formed a committee to 
study the feasibility of a UCSD 
school of architecture two years 
ago. The committee came back 
with a positive recommendation, 
which was sent to UC President 
David Gardner last year.

REX:FiredFromA~S. Position 
Continued rrom pile 1 
scribed his recolleclion of the 
scene at the meeting: "We took a 
recess. Everyone was grouped in 
Iheir little constituencies. As soon 
as I walked into the [UCSD] 
group, Maynard asked me who I 
would vote for. He said 'you will 
vote for Tisa.' I was caught off 
guard." 

When Rex responded that he 
would not do as Dimmesdale 
requested , " Maynard said, ' If you 
won't vote for Tisa, you're fired.' 
He put me on the spot," Rex 
continued. 

"We could have sat down and 
discussed it. An effective leader 
doesn't do that to others," Rex 
added . 

"Vaughn wanted to vote one 
way, and Maynard wanted to 
vote in another," slated Potash, 
who witnessed the entire scene. 
He also explained that the initial 
exchange took place under pres-
sure, in an unfavorable environ-
ment. "It was pretty sudden; out 
there in the hall. .. Maynard, 
Vaughn and myself were sur-
rounded by people. There were 
too many people around listen-
ing." 

Potash explained that follow-

mesdale. 

ing the initial exchange, the dis-
cussion was continued in a pri-
vate office, but that neither 
Dimmesdale nor Rex would 
change his position. 
. In the subsequent vote for 
UCSA President, Dimmesdale 
cast UCSD's vote for Poe, but 
Woodruff was elected by a vote of 
7-fJ. Dimmesdale has since been 
dissatisfied with WoodruWs per-
formance as UCSA President. 

"We're very unhappy with her. 
Unfortunately, this president has 
a tendency to assume more 
authority than she has. S he 's [also] 
extremely emotional," Dimmes-
dale said . 

Rex feels that the manner in 
which Dimmesdale removed him 
was inappropriate, and he was 
"frustrated and disappointed" by 
it. 

"That's just Maynard; 
Maybe he's just an ass-
hole." -Vaughn Rex 

"The first thing that I could 
think of was that, man, he's a 
racist. Not knowing him ... ( felt 
that it was a racist attitude," he 
said. 

After having time to reflect and 
discuss the situation with others, 
"I don't think he harbors any 
racist attitudes," Rex said; Wfhat's 
just Mlynard; maybe he's just an 
ushole." 

"Complete aDd utter bullshit, ... 
was how Potash responded to 

. Rex's mention of racism. "In no 
way was Vaughn treated any dif-
ferent because he wu a student of 
color. This is not a racist dispute 
at all." 

Potash attributed the differen-
ces between the two to " ... a con-
flict of personalities. I don't see 
either of them changing their 
position." 

While stating that he "can 
understand" that Rex is upset, 
Potash supports Dimmesdale in

Rex has a different view .

people's President.' [But] he 
doesn't have the savvy to deal 
with people," Rex charged. " If 
you're going for the interests of 
the students, you have to work 
through things." 

Rex is upset that, in his view, 
Dimmesdale has still not ade-
quately explained his actions, or 
apologized. He described himself 
as .... . just down to earth. If 
there's a problem, come talk to 
me." 

"It's getting to be personal," 
Rex admitted, "but I haven't per-
sonally attacked him. I don' bate 
the person - I just dislilte the way 
he deals with people. He wasn't 
sensitive enoush to understand 
why I was upset." 

Dimmesdale has been acting as 
UCSD's representative It UCSA 
meetings since the incident, and 
has indicated that he may do so 
for the remainder of his term. 
Rex has requested a bearing 
before the ASUCSD Judicial 
Board on his removal, and antici-
pates having one scheduled 
"sometime in mid-October."

International House Fills With First Residents 
By CINDY CHESY 
SIll/! Wrilft' 

The new lnternational House, 
a place for students, faculty and 
scholars to come together and live 
in an atmosphere of cultural 
diversity, yesterday welcomed 197 
students from over 30 different 
countries as its first residents. 

UCSD's International House, 
is one of only two such facilities in 
the UCsystem. The lnternational 
House at UC Berkeley, which 
opened in 1930, has about 600 
residents, most .of whom are at 
the post-graduate level. 

The concept behind the Inter-
national" House at UCSD, the 
original one in New York City, 
and the one at Berkeley is to pro-
vide an informal environment and 
programs that allow people to 
have an open exchange of infor-
mation and ideas. 

It is believed that when people 
from different cultures meet in 
this setting, it helps foster under-
standing, cooperation and friend-
ship among individuals from dif-
ferent nation. 

To accomplish an open CA-
change the people who apply to 
live there need to be committed to 
the philosophical and program· 
matic concepts of the Interna-
tional House. Active participation 
is essential because programs will 
be planned and carried out by the 
residents with the assistance of a 
professional staff. 

Typical program will include 
international speaker,. national 
theme days or evenings. di cw,-
sions about world i~sues and 
about cu ltural si milaritie and 
differences, multicultural festivals . 
research pre entations and recep-
tions for visiting dignitaries. 

One half of the residents are 

juniors and enio rs and one hal f 
are graduate and po~t doctora l 
students, all rangi ng ill age from 
19 to 45 years. 

There are five student staff 
who live and work at t he I nterna-
tional House and ant: Faculty 
Fellow in residence .. hm Skelly. 
Associate Director of the Insti-
tute on Global Conflict and 

ooperation. The resident will 
have the help of th is statfin plan-
ning and facili tat ing the programs. 

The new Pepper Canyon

International House i' located 
consists of two. three ,I.nd [ou , 
bedroom apartments . Harriet

dents from dominati ng the pro-
gram. 

"Some of the greatest interest 
in the International House has 
come from Americans who have 
st udied abroad," Marsh said. 
''These students would be able to 
continue to share concerns and 
perception with people of for-
eign origins at the International 
House without having to leave 
their own living rooms." 

According to Marsh, the Inter-

Fifth 
Continued from pale 1 

Dean Harriet March shares 
Lyon's view and said: "What we 
hope for is a graduate who will go 
out to a professional school with 
a global perspective. 

The international focus of Fifth 
College will extend into areas 
other than academics. Student 
activities and programs will have 
an international flavor such as 
celebrating international festivals 
and holidays. 

To aid in creating an envi-
ronment of international under-
standing and experience, most of 
the resident advisors are students 
who have had some type of foreign 
experience or who are fluent in 
another. 

Administrators as well have 
international backgrounds. For 
example, Dean Marsh was di-
rector of student affairs at the 
original International House in 
New York and Lyon is a German 

natio nal Hou,e will eventually 
include other facilities such as a 
cafeteria. apartments and activity 
rooms in a build ing in and of 
itself. But for now is shares the 
apartmellt complex and its open-
ing with Fifth College, whose 
"focus is a l~o on international 
cOllcerns." Marsh said .

Incoming freshmen at orienta-

tion seem excited about the 
prospect of working through this 
international program and 
studying abroad. According to 
Lyon all the students were already 
planning with each other where 
they will be going. 

Freshman Raeka Pigniczky 
said she came to Fifth mainly 
because of its international 
program and because "it sends 
you abroad." 

Pigniczky, who already is 
bilingual in Hungarian and speaks 
many other languages and who 
wants to pursue a career some-
where in international relations, 
was enthusiastic about starting 
the Fifth College program 11t·s] 
really new and exciting because 
everything is new and we don't 
have any boundaries." 

Freshman Marty Butterick said 
that although "international rela-
tions sounds interesting I won't 
do anything with it.

UCSD Grads Earn More 
By AMANDA DA TNOW 

Graduates of the class of 1987 an: earnina an 
avera. of 522,000 annually, a 6 percent pin over 
the 1986 paduates, aa:ordina to the results of the 
sixth annual Career Services Center survey. 

Although puates in tecbnical fieJdI make the 
mOlt money, 528,300 annually on the averaae, 
those who chose other fields of employment are 
allo earning more 
than ever before. 
Also the difference 
between the salar-
ies of occupational 
cateaories has be-
comelDlUJinal, aeat-
ina a healthy pic-
ture overall for 
UCSD paduates. 

Eiahty-eipt per-
ccnt of the padu-
ates seeking full-
time employment 
found it, leavina 
only 8 percent 
working part-time, 
half of those by 
choice. MOlt of the 
workina II'Bduates 
have jobs in techni-
cal fields, however 
those in sales 
showed the most 
growth. 

Survey statistics 
show that mOlt of the graduates found their jobs 
throuJh pmonal contacts, whether by referral or 
previous experience with their employer. 

The majority of the 1987 puatel did in fact 
enter the work force, but of thOle who didn't 
mOlt went on to meclicalschool. Historically, 

medicine has always been the most common 
choice of post ar-duate study. More and more, 
however, araduatel are pURuing other types of 
advanced study such as education or law. 

Amona the 1987 araduates, eia1lt students 
received the National Science Foundation fel-
lowships, second only to Berkeley who has the 
hiabest number in the nation. 

The class of 1987 pve hiaher ratinp of their 
preparation than any previous class. Ninety per-

cent of the aradu-
ates felt that their 
preparation for 
"coping with pres-
sure" was excellent 
or good. Accordina 
to career services 
director NeiJ Mur-
ray, this proves that 
while UCSD may 
seem like a pressure 
cooker to many 
students, this kind 
of experience helps 
tremendously in 
araduate school 
and in the work 
force. He also 
added that the abil-
ity to cope with 
pressure is a uni-
versally valued 
trait. 

Graduates pve 
high marks on aU 
factOR of prepara-

tion upon which they were surveyed. makina this 
the stronaest part of the poIt araduate picture. 

In terms ohhe quality of education at UCSD, 
86 percent of the araduates found it excellent or 
very 18tisfactory, while 3 perccnt found it 1ess 
than 18tisfactory.

Parking Costs Rise 
By CYNTHIA CHESY 
Staff Writ" 

Among changes in the parking 
situation this year are an absence 
of a distinction between commu-
ter and resident parkina spaces 
and an increase in the cost of a 
parking permit to 5144. 

According to Parking and 
Transportation Services adminis-
trative assistant Suzette Monette, 
the reason behind the increase in 
permit cost is that parking lou are 
becoming more expensive to build 
and the campus is expanding. 
Currently, there is one lot under 
construction, south of Lot 603 by 
the School of Medicine. 

Another factor justifying the 
rate raise was that "UCSD is gear-
ina up for a new shuttle system 
with possibly new and longer

routes and bi.f buses," Monette 
said. 

Also, students can ipore the 
diamond signs on the parking 
spaces this year. "The old system 
wasn't working and was too con-
fusins." Monette said. 

"The diamonds were left on the 
pavement because the university 
might go back to the old system 
another year." 

Another chanae: Lot 503 by 
the Warren Apartments, pre-
viously entirely student spaces, 
will now have only staff, faculty 
and metered spaces because of the 
new engineering building. 

On a pocitive note, there will be 
a new information booth on Gil-
man Drive at the entrance of the 
campus. The booth's staff will try 
to lessen the anxiety of campus 
visitOR by answering questions 
and handing out campus maps.

HI EVERYONE, WELCOME BACK! 

This summer was a very active one for several members of the 
A.S. Council who dedicated a considerable amount of beach time in 
order to improve a few services and activities. 

The Commissioner of Public Relations, Tom Rhee, produced 
an excellent brochure for new students and with the help from several 
other people, completed this year's A.S. Advance Magazine. Pick one 
up at EDNA or several other locations throughout school. 

The Programming Commissioner, Jonathan Judaken, along 
with the programming committee have been working on this year's 
activities. A surprising amount of preparation is necessary to produce 
our events and Jonathan is surely doing aU he can. 

Bard-Alan Finlan, the Student Advocate, has spent all 
summer compiling a library of campus regs. , procedure and policy 
manuals to prepare himself for the most productive year the Student 
Advocate's Office has seen. Additionally, the Sun God Chairs, Tina 
Maher and Johnny Patterson, are already working on our biggest event 
of the year. 

The Vice President 01 Finance and Manager of the A.S. 
Grove Cafre, Eduardo Rallo-Verdugo, is preparing plans for the 
expansion of the A.S. Grove Caffe. Service will be dramatically 
improved while the atmosphere remains intimate and relaxing. 

I'd be remiss jf I didn't mention Mordecai Potash, V.P. Exter-
nal, and his staff for their unending work in community and inter-
campus relations. Mordi practically lives "A S.". 

Finally, Randy Woodard (A.S. Advisor) and Patty Sullivan 
(A.S. Secretary) and the rest of the staff have helped us, the Associated 
Students, prepare for a truly dynamic year. Look for the AS. Booth . 
throughout Welcome Week, read the AS. Bulletin with our new 
"Questions and Answers" section and enjoy the activities starting off 
the '88-'89 academic year. 

Cheers,

Freshman Orientation 
Nothing could have ~red me 

for the first few moments WIth my 
roommate. '1\nique"-nothing more, 
just ':.\nique"-was her name. Change 
the "A" to a "U" and you've got a 
description. 

When they asked what type of 
roommate I wanted, I didn't know that 
I needed to be more specific than non-
smoker. I could swear I saw a picture 
of Anique on a postcard I got from 
London. Within five minutes, I found 
out that she was an Art History stu-
dent, into the Psychedelic Furs, and 

. totally, toraJJy against the domesti-
cation of animals. 

I was just about ready to put in 
for a room transfer when she 

reached into her leather 
backpack, pulled out a 
can of Suisse Mocha and 
offered me a cup. Okay, I t 

decided Hi keep an open mind. " 
As we sipped our cups, I 

found out that Anique and I share. 
the same fondness for Cary Grant 

movies, the same disdain for wine 
coolers, and the same ex-boyfriend. 

That gave us plenty to talk about.

-Jerry Garcia, Robert Hunter, 
"Shakedown Street" 

Shakedown Street indeed. If you're a frosh, you've 
paid your fees, checked into your concrete monstros-
ity dorm, stood in line a lot, met a bunch of people 
from Hillsborough, Beverly Hills and Del Mar and 
spent a lot of money on books. 

You've already noticed that life is expensive in La 
Jolla, even if you're well off. If you're on financial aid, 
you might have noticed that you have plenty of 
money to spend - today. It might already have 
occurred to you that your next check is in January .. .. 

The price of experience is higher than you thought 
it was, in short. 

UCSD is a problematic place. The student body is 
overwhelmingly middle and upper class, overwhelm-
ingly white and fairly conservative and traditional in 
political and social attitudes. 

Yet, this campus is a one-time center of student 
radicalism. Angela Davis went here, and Herbert 
Marcuse taught here despite attempts by the Ameri-
can Legion to run him out of town. Herbert Schiller 
still teaches Communications, and a poll of the His-
tory Department would give Oukakis a landslide. 
Even the design of the campus, i.e., large decentral-
ized concrete buildings with tiny windows, was origi-
nally set forth with the thought of minimalizing dam-
age from and preventing large gatherings of student 
protestors. 

Two thousand students marched in a ring around 
the campus in 1980 to protest President Carter's draft 
registration plans, and those who saw it will never 
forget the ghoulish excitement on campus the day 
John Hinckley fired his unregistered handgun at 
Ronald Reagan. 

Shantytowns protesting South African aparth~id 
sprung up in Revelle Plaza two years ago despite 
campus police efforts to tear them down. 

Leftist remnants abound. The Che Cafe the 
Women's Center, various ethnic and social political 
action groups, Groundwork Books and still commit-
ted albeit somewhat sedentary professors can be 
found without too much effort. 

There is life beyond the wealthy suburbs that pro-
vide so much of UCSO's popUlation, but you have to 
poke around to find it. You can join a fraternity or 
sorority, for example; they're visible, easy to join and 
very active. You will make friends quickly by pledg-
ing Greek. But these friends are likely to resemble 
yourself - suburban, settled and committed to the 
social order. If you look beyond that system, you're 
liable to find world radically different from your own, 
a world that has something to teach you. 

There is life beyond a Biology degree and a trip to 
medical school. The literature and history depart-
ments are sprinkled with students who dropped out of 
Biology and Chemistry and Physics ~use they 
w.tnted to discuss the way human beings relate to 
each other. 

There's nothing wrong per se with being a pre-Med 
Greek guzzling lots of beer on the weekends, but you 
might try acid and dope. Give up meat . Work for the 
alternative media. Actively seek people from other 
countries and social backgrounds. 

. Wh~tever yo~ try, the core of the college expe-
nence IS expandmg your social horizons so that you 
may better understand and experience your academic 
work.

"Oh, sure, I read the news-

Actually, if you are statistically 
average, you have spent most of 
your life getting your news from 
Dave McElhatton in San Fran-

Angeles or Kimberly Hunt in San 
Diego, convinced that the Sky 
Copter is a reporter's most valua-

So, when and if you actually 
get concerned enough about 
campus politics or issues to "get

Even Patrick Buchanan rolls his eyes back in his head when conver-
sation turns to the possibility of a Dan Quayle presidency. 

That is a profoundly disturbing notion at any price. Like betting 
800: I that insects will not rule the world in your lifetime ... 

It was one ofthose options that nobody wanted to talk about. Roger 
Ailes, the man credited with the concept of the New Nixon, called it 
silly, and Bush refused to comment. He had made his choice privately, 
he said; and if it looked like the work of a pimply teen-age boy on his 
first gig with a computer dating service, So what? He was, after all, The 
Captain. And the captain's work is law on the open ocean. 

For the fint time in his life George Bush had real power. It was 
tangible, it was leverage, it was the currency of empire . . . and appar-
ently it went to his head. He got so high on it that not even James Baker 
could reach him. After all that waiting his eyes were on fire. And some

Nixon and Ed Meese ... the list was long. That rich punk DuPont made 
fun of him about taxes and Dole had called him a liar. Even Barry 
Goldwater said he was phony. 

David Stockman was gone too, that treacherous little creep, along 
with Donald Repn, and the swinish Larry Speakes. They bad all 
crossed him in those yean after the magic was gone, and they had all 
passed from the scene. The list was long; but it wu another list George 
had been reading out loud to himself every night since the Iowa 
caucuses. His time bad come.

••• Let me tell you how it worked, in those yean. To get into the 
National Guard, you had to be either a top draft choice in the NFL, or 
a C student with a rich grandfather. 

Y cah, that was Quayle. He had a rich grandfather and I was a No. 2 
draft choice. He went one way and I went the other, except that I failed 
my draft physical. A month or so later, on opening day aginst the 
Dolphins, I wu a starlinl wide receiver in the National Football 
League .... 

We had two other hot-rod draft choices that year. They were both 
starten and they were both memben of the National Guard. Hell, it 
was normal! Every team in the league owned two or three slots in the 
Guard, so they could protect tlK:ir top draft choices from goinl to 
Vietnam. 

And nobody went, remember? Except maybe a few guys from the 
taxi squad and some free agents. How many professional football 
playen charged up Hamburger HOO How many rich kids? How many 
senaton'sons? Not many. 

But that was not the point in this squabble over little Danny Quayle, 
sometimes known as Bush Lite. No. The iuue here is competence. Just

With Cesar 
Chavez and 
TheUFW 
By ANA PEREZ 

Robert Kennedy came to the 
Central Valley town of Delano in 
1968 to break with United Farm 
Workers' leader cesar Chavez, 
ending Chavez' 2S-day fast on 
behalf of non-vin1ence and union 
contracts. 

Twenty years I .. ttr, Chavez 
now 61, was fasting apin, this 
time for 36 days to protect UFW 
worken and consumen from five 
deadly pesticides that were also 
crippling and killing farm worken 
and their children. 

This summer I spent some time 
with the UFW. Dan Martin, a 
UCSD graduate and a friend, 
uked me to 10 up. At fll'St, I 
planned to make a documentary 
video, but CCsar's fast chansed 
my plans. I arrived in Delano July 
27, the eleventh day of the fut. 

From the fint day i-was there 
until I left, I felt a part of the farm 
worker family. Farm worken, 
union board memben and staff, 
volunteen and supporten are all 
members of this family and are all 
committed and responsible indi-
viduals. The staff and board 
memben did an extraordinary 
job at keeping union business 
running as usual during the fast 
and at the same time dealing with 
media, security and visit on. 

work on orpnizinJ for the event. 
Since no one knew the actual 
date, preparations had to be made 
quicldy so that everything would 
be ready to go on a day's notice. I 
started working with two UFW 
lawyen to provide food for 10,000 
people. We planned the dishes to 
be served, bought food and serv-
ing supplies and orpnized the 
labor force for the actual day.

Robert K.ennedy's widow, came 
to Delano to celebrate the end of 
the fast. After breakin. bread 
with Ethel, Cesar handed a 
wooden cross to Jesse Jackson, 
symbolizing the passing of the 
fast to supporten such u Jackson 
and othen present. Along with 
fasting from one to three days, 
supporters also pledged to boy-
cott stores that sell California 
grapes, a policy known as non-
cooperation with supermarkets. 

"She warned of the possibility of irreparable damage to Cesar's vital body 
tissues. Despite all the warning, Cesar committed himself to continue," 

Everyday of the fast an average 
of 7S telepams of support arrived 
from all over the nation, and a 
IDUI was celebrated with an 
average of about 2SO farm 
worken, many stayina for aU-
niaht viIiJa· 

The rust few days I was there, I 
helped Dan in the boycott d~ 
partment. I took down Picitetinl 
reports from farm worken of the 
area. On the 25th day, cesar 
decided that the UFW would hold 
a celebration for the breaking of 
his fut. Half the staff started to 

press conference. She warned of 
the possibility of irreparable 
damage to cesar's vital body 
tissues. Despite all the waminp, 
cesar committed hiJnself to con-
tinue. He continued to work dur-
in. the fast until becomina unable 
to do 10 in the last few days. 

Accordina to Moses, he suf-
fered not only from lack of food 
and nourishment and physical 
pain, but also nausea, upset 
stomach, extreme weariness and

_ On August 21, Ethel Kennedy, 

There bad been a chain of fastina 
and protests all over the country 
in support of the UFW since that 
day.

watcr-only fast. There wu, finally, 
no tissue damaae and his spirits 
were high.

So Many D elighifJlI S tyles Make a Remarkable Place 
An Architectural Potpourri 
By ROBERT LEONE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Welcome to uc D, where 
architectural diversity is part of 
the master plan. The original plan 
for this place was supposed to 
include orne 12 to 15 colleges, the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanog-
raphy, and a few profes ional 
schools So far, we've got five col-
leges, a chool of Medicine. a 

chool oflnternatlona I Relations 
a nd Pacific tudles, 10. and a 
lot of bu ild ings that look pretty 
ugly. 

In fact , the upercomputer 
Center building "won" an Onion 
a ward from a consortium oflocal 
professional architectural societies 
III 1986. Another Onion was given 
to UCSD in 1987 for it' overall 
planning. 

John Woods, Associate Vice 
Chancellor for Resource Man-
agement, accepted that 1987 
award, but likes UCSD's architec-
tural diversity. "It's a different 
campus than most of the other 
U Cs. It's eclectic. " 

One can tell much about UCSD 
by its buildings. Consider the neo-
Renaissance whit concrete and 
expansive, open plaza at Revelle. 
In the e tiled and white painted 
palaces of research and office 
space there's a demonstration of 
the Sputnik-boom optimism of 
UCSD's scientist-founders. 

~he Undergraduate Library, 
whIch o ld-timers occasiona lly call 
"Cluster," is a t race of UCS D's 
original master plan. Originally, 
there were supposed to be four 
such libraries, each one serving 
three or four colleges. And "Cen-
tral" library (one of UCSD's few 
architectural marvels) would 
actually be in the middle of cam-
pus, not between the campus and 
the parking lots. 

Then there's Muir, where tall 
concrete towers cast cold shad-
ows onto nearby lawns. One can 
sense the pessimism and conser-
vatism of the architects in these 
early 70s riot-resistant buildings. 
Many people are unable to recon-
cile the college'~ architecture with 
the name of ardent preservation-
ist John Muir, but just think of 
the gray concrete as an attempt to 
replicate the Sierra Nevada range 
on campus. 

In Third College, a creation of 
the early a nd middle 70s, one can 
see an indication that UCSD had 
gone onto a budget. Third's white 
a nd beige stucco on low buildings 
showed that the Regents weren't 
in the mood to spend lots of 
bucks . While Revelle's buildings 
evoke greatness and Muir's build-
ings are great examples of the UC 
Gothic style, Third's most en-
lightening architecture, the Third 
College Humanities Building, 
resembles a Motel 6. T here is 
more open space than at Muir, 

though. 
Warren's running with Exten-

sion for dead last, though . Many 
buildings at Warren are United 
States Marine Corps cast-offs. 
Even the dorms. Warren is the 
land of the Quonset huts, the tail 
end of the Matthews Academic 
Administration Complex, 
UCSD's ultimate attempt at 
creating a college on the cheap, 
following the Jerry Brown Aus-
terity Plan. 

Fifth College, so far, seem to 
consist of the Pepper Canyon 
housing development. Maybe it's 
Third College with brown trim. 

The new buildings are a scream. 
With a few exceptions, the latest 
campus structures fit some back 
to Bauhaus/ Miami Vice post-
modern tyle. The geometric 
repetitions of Engineering Unit 
One, the Art Deco funkyness and 
detailing of the Third College 
dorms (a rebellion against stucco?) 
and the waterhazards and funny 
windows of the ornate Price Cen-
ter (also under construction) show 
tha t on-campus institutional 
architecture is entering a new 
phase. 

With this piecemeal approach, 
will UCSD ever look good? 
According to Woods, "1 think it's 
going to be a very good approach. 
It think it will make us a very 
d istinctive campus. I do lik.e it and 
it can work very well."

of them can't even cope with a standard-brand cheap-shot political 
accusation that one of them once joined the National Guard? 

Who cares which one it was? Or why? T he real problem here is that 
the combined talents of the whole Bush-Quayle machine can't handle 
the simplest question. Reagan would have laughed it off by now. Just a 
shrug and smirk on his wal k to the heli-pad while these two d ilettante 
hacks are working on their sixth day of it . What would they d o with a 
real problem? 

George Bush can't remember anything he did past sundown since 
1980, and Danny Quayle is ju t barely smart enough to tie his own 
shoes. Gorbachev will eat them both like grapes. 

• • • 
According to Newsweek and C N, the Bush-Quayle show wowed 

so many women that 10 million of them changed their minds over-
night, and became RepUblicans again. The alleged "gender gap" closed 
so fast after the debacle in the uperdome that the "women's vote"is no 
longer a factor in the presidential election. George picked up 17 points 
when he put that newt on the ticket. 

Maybe o. I have never beheved these numbers anyway. They are no 
more reliable than the tip sheets they hand out under the grandstand at 
c~ck fights . If the "women's vote" in this election turned to jelly at the 
Sight of Danny Quayle, we are all in for a long winter and the future is 
full of bad cra7iness . . .. For now I would like to hear from anybody 
who wants to give me Dukak.is and nine points. I can cover almost 
a~ything that cO.mes in, at those numbers , and Jack Nicholson says he 
Will cover anythtng I can't. "Women are crazy," he said, "but they are 
not dumb. Quayle looks like one of those blow-dried hustlers that you 
see parking cars at the Whiskey a·Go-Go." 

My own quick fix on November is that George will lose and it will be 
Danny that drags him down.

This u arter, I will work on

time I spent in Delano was the 
equivalent of a year of learning, 
not only because I listened and 
took notes, but because I organ-

work paid off. I'm grateful to the

It's strange to be back at UCSD.

Students Play At Mission 8ay_ 

MBAC Lures Students Down by the Sea 
By WENDY STEINLE 
GUIlrdlan Intern 

Stress is inevitable unless you 
are Wonder Woman and can 
escape in your invisible jet, or 
Superman, who is known to 
single-handedly fly into space and 
rotate the globe counter-clockwise 
in order to save a few hours to 
rescue Lois, finish that term paper, 
or whatever. 

What better way to release stress 
and curtail a few grey hairs than 
to spend a couple of hours a week 
learning how to ride the surf, cap-
ture the wind in your sails, or sla-
lom ski behind a power boat? 
These skills and many more are 
taught by the instructional staff of 
the Mission Bay Aquatic Center. 

Tom Fisher, instructional 
manager of the sailing and wind 
surfing programs, explained that 
classes are held in four week ses-
sions. Registration is now in pro-
gress for the second fall session, 
which begins on Oct. 8 and runs 
through Nov . 4. 

Classes are scheduled to accom-
modate the schedules of the San 
Diego area college students. "We 
arc an educational facility, we are 
here to teach aquatic sports to the 
collegiate community," Fisher 
said. 

The "collegiate community" 
encompasses students, faculty, 
staff, and alumni of UCSD. 
SDSU, USD, National Univer-
sity, and Grossmont and Mesa 
Colleges. If a person is not affil-
iated with the p~ing colleges, 
"he or she can still take a class at 
the Mission Bay Aquatic Center 
(MBAC) by enrolling in the San 
Diego State University Extension 
Program. This is the only way in 
which the public bas access to the 
MBAC educational program," 
explained Fisher. 

For many college students, 
aquatic sports are an area of 
untapped experience. Most stu-
dents who put aside the time to 
engage in them, however, find 
them exhilarating, an excellent 

source of exercise, and a means to 
release the stress of being a UCSD 
student. 

Fisher said that the MBAC 
receives a subsidy from UCSD 
and SDSU, which comes from a 
fund taken out of student regis-
tration fees . Because of this sub-
sidy, UCSD and SDSU students 
pay a smaller participation fee 
than the rest of the San Diego 
area collegiate community. 

"We are giving UCSD and 
SDSU students the lowest price 
we can . . . " Fisher said. 

According to Fisher, the most 
popular classes offered at MBAC 
arc the surfing classes. He finds 
that the beginning classes are in 
higher demand due to students 
attending San Diego universities 
from non-beach communities who 
want to learn the "beach sports." 

The beginning surfing class is 
designed to teach the student from 
the grass roots. "A beginner will 
not be able to learn on a short, 
fiberglass board at Blacks 
[Beach]," explained Fisher. "A 
progression is needed from a long, 
foam rubber board to a polyure-
thane board, and finally to a shor-
ter, fiberglass board; this is the 
course of instruction MBAC 
offers." 

There are two instructors per 
class; one stays on the beach to 
handle emergencies, while the 
other watches the students from 
the white water area to offer 
instruction after each wave. 

Surfboards are provided and 
wet suits are available at $1 per 
class.

Finlan has first-hand experience battling for student rights. 

Sailing is another popular sport 
in which MBAC offers instruc-
tion. 

"The sailing program is tiered, 
similar to some yacht club pro-
grams. [The student] starts out in 
a small boat that is the least com-
plicated available, then moves on 
to larger, more complicated boats 
that are more powerful," Fisher 
said. 

Each participant in the begin-
ning class sails a Sabot, an eight-
foot, single-handed dingy. 

In the first advanced class the 
participant moves to the Laser, "a 
bigger, more high performance 
boat, but still a single-handed 
dingy," Fisher said. The Omega, 
also used in the advanced sailing 
class, is a two penon boat which 
the sailing participants must learn 
to operate. 

In the more advanced class, 
which is a clinic, the student is 
introduced to the Hobie 16, a 
high performance catamaran. 

Classes in keel boating are also 
available. 

"The boats are chosen for the 
fact that each teaches something 
different," Fisher said. Each type 
ofhoat can be rented by graduates 
of courses using that boat. 

MBAC also offers courses in 
water skiing. This is a particularly 
good opportunity because many 
people are unable to learn this 
sport due to the expenses and 
inconveniences of the required 
speed boat. 

The water-skiing class meets 
for three hours once a week for 
four weeks. 

Beach starts are taught in both 
the multi-level and advanced 
classes. The requirement for the 
advanced water-skiing classes is 
that the student is able to ski with 
regularity and cross the wake of 
boat without falling. 

"Graduates of either of the 
water-skiing classes are eligible to 
purchase a water-skiing recrea-
tion card, which is $30 for five 
two-and-a-haIf hour [boat] uses," 
Fisher said. 

Other water sports in which 
MBAC offers instructions are 
windsurfing, scuba diving, kayak-
ing and rowing. 

As weU as instructional rowing, 
MBAC hosts the San Diego col-
legiate competitive men's and 
women's rowing teams. Along 
with the junior varsity and varsity 
teams, most schools have a novice 
rowing team, which is similar to a 

'beginning rowing ~Iass. 

~They [the coaches] teach you 
how to row. If you want to be a 
competitive rower, you start just 
like the instructional rowing pro-
grams do," Fisher said. 

Engaging in athletic competi-
tion can be both physicaUy and 
mentaUy healthy.

ran of the UCSD women's crew 
team, said "being in the Mission

Bard-Alan Finlan Fights for 
Student Rights 
By JOHN SHAW 
Editor in Chief 

It has been said that knowledge 
is power. At UCSD, a broad 
knowledge of university policies 
and procedures can be a student's 
single-most valuable survival tool. 

There are volumes of university 
documents that detail what rights 
students possess and how students 
can go about exercising those 
rights . To fully understand how 
these documents can work for 
students, individuals must invest 
a considerable amount of time 
and energy. 

Fortunately, there are two offi-
ces on campus that take much of 
the guesswork and frustration out 
of the process of understanding 
and protecting one's rights. They 
are the Office of the Student 
Advocate and Student Legal 
Services. 

The Office of the Student 
Advocate is a service provided by 
the Associated Students that pro-
vides information and guidance . 
on topics as divene as course 
grade appeals, problems with 
student jobs, various forms of 
discrimination, difficulties 
concerning financial aid, and 
alleged student conduct violations. 

Bard-Alan Finlan is UCSD's 
Student Advocate. Finlan has 
come to understand UCSD's stu-
dent rights policies and proce-
dures through practical experi-
ence. Over the past 15 months, he 
has utilized campus documents in 
his own fight with the university 
concerning his privacy rights. In 
this time, Finlan has been respon-
sible for uncovering serious 
administrative decisions and 
actions that have reduced some 
student rights and jeopardized 
others. 

"I consider my job repsonsibili-

ties to include both protecting 
student rights on an individUal 
basis and protecting student 
rights collectively by fighting to 
maintain and strengthen student 
rights in existing campus poli-
cies," Finlan said . 

In some instance ', the univer-
sity is required to )licit student 
input before it can J pt campus 
policies that will ( I cctly affect 
students. Accordin to Finlan. 
the university ha onsistently 
drafted policies tha t h.we reduced 
student input requir nents. 

Finlan says that ne campus 
document, UCSD udent Re-
lated Regulations, ')')/icies and 
Procedures. has b~ 1 altered to 
reduce considerabh the amount 
of student inpu t vn campus 
policies.

Java Junkies Escape The Grind 

Coffeehouses Brew Food For Thought 
By DENNIS WOO 
Staff Writer 

O verheard at the Grove Carte: "Do you drink cof-fee for the taste or for the 
buzz?" 

I didn't calch the answer. But if 
the question were put to me, I'd 
have said, "I drink coffee because 
1 enjoy thinking and wondering." 

Thinking and wondering. One 
would think a college student 
would have enough brainwork to 
do. But, paradoxically, university 
life seems to freeze certain mental 
activities. So much time is spent 
completing assignments, and so 
little is spent just plain thinking 
and wondering. In some small 
way drinking coffee remedies the 
situation. In his book, Coffee. 
coffee merchant Kenneth Davids 
writes that coffee is the wine of 
Apollo, the heverage of thought, 
dream, and dialectic, the milk of 
thinkers and chess players. So, 
drinking coffee guides me toward 
contemplations otherwise lost. 

. On the II'IIdition of theooft'cchouae, 
scholar Ralph Hattox writes in 
his book Coffn and Coffeehouses: 
1ft] was above all a place for talk: 
serious or trivial, high-minded or 
base, that place more than any 
other seemed to lend itself to the 
art of conversation. Amid the 
relaxing surroundings and 
atmosphere of leisure afforded by 
the grand metropolitan coffee-
house, caffeine-stimulated talk 
thrived. " 

San Diego coffeehouse regu-
.lars understand the tradition. 
They sit waiting to engage in con-
versation on any topic imagina-
ble. "]n comers of the coffee-
house, there might be heated 
discussions on art, the sciences or 
literature," Hattox writes. 

At off-campus coffeehouses, 
talking with other scholars (either 
conversational or rogue), profes-
sional-types, working class folks 
and Bohemians may give stu-
dent's a first tenuous glimpse of 
the so-called real world. The rogue 
scholars may be the most interest-
ing regulars. 

"The cafe is intimately con-

nectcd with its own special brand 
of informal study and intellectual 
loafing." Davids writes. "A cus-
tomer with his nose buried in 
reading matter is a common silht 
in even the most low-brow cafe. " 
The notion that thinking and 
wondering goes on among per-
SODS not enrolled in school .ay 
be startling, but can be aflllaled 
by examiniq coffeehouse "10-
lars. 

San Di., seems caught., in 
the new coftecbouse renais_ce. 
"In the U.S. of the '8Os, a new 
kind of North American cafe tra-
dition is evolving, "Davids writes. 
"In our cae, we are evolvina an 
idea of a cafe based on a pre-
World War II Italian model dlat 
hardly exists anymore in Itat,'." 

San Diego borrows from Berke-
ley's cafe ~on, as coffeehouses 
there take hm pre-war Italy. 
The university ere has migrated 
south along the West Coa~t. 

TIll coffeeh-.se in Berkeley, 
thou.. may be overdone. Ac-
cordiDlIo one news report, the 30 
cafes near UC Berkeley sell close 
to 40,000 cups of Italian coffee a 
day, or 1.2 cups per day, per stu-
dent. The glut gives rile to an anti-
coffeehouse sentiment. 

A song jabbing at the preten-
sions of coffeehouse regulars por-
trays a newcomer complaining: 
"Look at this menu . . . half this 
stuff isn't even written ill Ameri-
can! What's dis? 111 have a 
Calf-fay-la-tay . ... " 

The coffeehouse does have a 
history of boity-toity-ness and 
ego-driven pseudo-intellectuality 
among its patrons. Books by 

Nietzche are always strong sellers 
in communities with good es-
presso cafes. 

But take heart, San Diego has 
nowhere as many cafCs as Berke-
ley. Perhaps their scarcity makes 
them more valued . They are, 
however, still reasonably priced. 

House coffee is S.7S a cup at 
Quel Fromage in H.rest, S.2S a 
refill. Espresso drinks are a bit 
costlier, but thankfully less 
expensive than the JOing price in 
Paris - 54 a cup. It's cheaper to 
be a Bohemian in San Diego, and 
cheaper stiIJ to get the infinite 
refill at Denny's. But then the cof-
feehouse crowd is missing. 

The dearth of coffeehouses here 
seems to make the crowd more 
diverse - everyone is drawn to 
these few places. I've met, among 
others, cub reporters for the Los 
Angeles nmes, a lawyer, an ele-
mentary school teacher, a profes-
sional art collector, a computer 
science grad student, a carpenter, 
a drifter from Denver, and a fel-
low whose parents cllarge him for 
dinner. 

The pastiche of students, yup-
pies, punks, bums, bon vivants, 
and other wearers of black at the 
Java Coffeehouse downtown 
compares well with Espresso 
Roma up north. 

Critics might poke at the waf-
fling political edge of San Diego 
coffeehouses, if not the '805 cof-
feehouse in general. The ideal of 
the traditionally radical cof-
feehouse is antithetical to our pol-
itically conservative climate.

Coffee: Making a 
Splash in San Diego 
CoatInId frOl8 ,.,. 11 
from the cafe. of history have 
usually been in the direction of 
chanae rather than maintenance 
ofthe status quo," Davids writes. 
"Since coffee does encourage 
thought, we may very weU con-
sider it a radical bewrase, as 
thinking leads 10 inevitably to 
comparisons between what is and 
what could be." 

These thoughts materialize in 
many ways. For example, Hattox 
said: "Coffeehouses are political 
places: Moretban one coup d'Ctat 
bas been launched from, or at 
least plotted in, a coffeehouse." 

The mum of the coffeehouse 
appears to be a yuppHred phe-
nomenon - an old concept that 
bas had the cobwebs brushed off 
for the we of imap and profit-
makina. The thinking that takes 
place in coffeehouses, it foUows, 
tends to be more grounded, less 
lofty. And if coffeehoUIC thinking 
bas turned conservative, it paral-
lels the trend of the university, 
where once the main concern of 
students was to develop a mean-
ingful pbilolophy of life, now it is 
aeneraUyto prepare fMthe work-
place. 

I roDically, it ICCIDI tbia lhift in 
the role of the University is 
rapolllibie for the coffeehouse 
reviVal. Plotting apilllt authority 
aeldom bappenI at theaoft'eehoUIC 
anymore; plotting to become 
authority is more likely to be the 
mainstay of converueion. 

Davida remains failbful to the 
radical tradition. laowever: 
.. AIthoup the prindfal readina

appears to be the mtau and the 
leadin, inteUectu" ell;ercile

there are coffee and .... b1e-top 
table&, tbere is hope. If the cap-
puccini teep imprcMna. great 
ideas. revolution, aoct aood p0e-
try may &pin appear.-

If the coffeehouse it no longer 
the pthering spot of politicos and 
activists. perhaps it isltill a lood 
place for pthering onaelf. In the 
cafe, you feel yourself coming 
together. 

You ltart piecing toaether the 
fragments of their lives. CoUeae 
begins to make sense. Conversa-

tion gOCl from the symmetry of 
MaxweU's equations to the per-
fection of Platonic forma ... 
science and the humanities come 
toaether .. . . 

The sensation is sliahtly medic-
inal, sliahtly Shirley MacLaine. 

In the cafe. you feel a bit 
roguish, off-the-cuff. You find 
younelf offering opinions you 
wouldn' dare voice in clan. The 
dynamics have chanaect - the 
Jl'oup of people gathered around 
you is now a manapable handful 
instead of the 300 in Peterson 
Hall. And everyone around your 
lman table baa coffee. You feel 
important. 

Knowing that the coffeehouse 
is open late lives a seDIC of IeCUr-
ity, too. Some cloae u early as II 
p.m., others stay open unti12 a.m. 
every day of the week. Too often 
I've heard complaints such as: 
"San Diego is a sleepy town. 
Everything closes at 6 o'clock ... . .. 
Coffeehouses give niahthawks 
places to flock. 

Then there is the chance meet-
ingat the counter. The cafe coun-
ter is an appeal to the feelint of 
adventure, impulse and our basic 
social sensibilities. At the univer-
lity, students' lenses are contra-
dicted. They sit in 1ecture balIa 
with hundreds of people but rand 
it diffICUlt to pal up with one 
another. 

After a couple of yean, stu-
dents often forget how to say 
beUo to Itranaers. Social atrophy 
may be an inevitable by-product 
of university Iearniq. 

The ailuation it Dot raUy 10 
bleak. The University bas many 
meetina ooob and pIIIeeI of con-
....non. Dormitory b.awaya are 
a ltaple. For thoae of Iepl drink-
ina aF, there's the Pub. Denny's 
and Roberto's are always nearby 
and open. And, from the looks of 
it, the new University Center will 
be a fine .. therin, spot, a social 
center, a place to think and 
wonder and converse. 

Universities need their coffee-
houses and havens of conversa-
tion to foster what begins in the 
clusroom. Indeed the essence of 
the coffeehouse is the Ipirit of 
academy itself.

friends is a areat release, and 
makes the transition to college life 
easier." 

Accorcling to Fisher, enroUment 
in the classes is approximately 
two-thirds SDSU and one third 
UCSD . "We have the mOlt 
trouble reaching UCSD students 
because they are more focused on 
campus." 

UCSDstudent Lila Naffa, who 
took windsurfing at MBAC, said, 
"If you want to fit the sport into 
your schedule, you just work it 
out. The instruction is excellent 
and it is a needed break from the 
traditional school education." 

The alternative education of 
aquatic sports which Mission Bay 
Aquatic Center offers is "only 
accessible through the collegiate 
community," Fisher said . He 
added that M 8AC offers the least 
expensive and best quality aqua-
tic instruction available In the 
city. 

"All Mission Ba: Aquatic Cen-
te"\ instructon are ( ,rtified in car-
dio pulmona lry I _s usc itation , 

advanced Iifeaavin& and fUlt aid, .. 
Fisher said. Periodically. they 
eapge in traininJ sessions which 
keep their lkills up to date. 

In the event of an emergency, a 
whistle is blown or a smoke flare is 
lit to sianal the on-shore opera-
tions of the accident. The para-
medica, whOle response time is 
usually two or three minutes, are 
caUed, and wait at the dock, to 
treat the situation. 

"We have a better response 
than Harbor PatrOl," Fisher said . 

Mission Bay Aquatic Center is 
located at I 00 I Santa Clara Point, 
in San Diego. Transporation to 
and from the center is not pro-
vided, but San Diego Transit bus 
route 34 provides direct service 
from UCSD to M8AC. 

Enrolling in one of the many 
M8AC classe couJd be a good 
way to cool down mid-<juarter 
burnout. 

More information on M8AC 
wilJ be available starting Mon-
doay, Sept. !9 at the Mission Bay 
Aquatic Center table in the Re-
velle Plaza. 

Bard-Alan Finlan 
Coudaued froIIl ..... l' 
tives," Finlan said. "In 1983, that 
was chanled to two studenl 
representatives. And lut year, 
even though they were still 
required to receive input from 
two students, the university i11e-
laUy adopted a policy with input 
from onJy one student." 

FinJan wrote to the chancellor, 
all the college deans, the student 
conduct coorindator, and a top 
university official in Berkeley 
alerting them to this violation. 
According to Finlan, not a single 
administrator wrote back. 

Finlan was appointed to the 
Student Advocate position last 
spring. Since then, he has 
requested and received nearly 
every university policy and regu-
lation in effect. He says that the 
only documents he had any diffi-
culty obtaining were the set of 
campus policies that detail nearly 
allitudent rights. 

"The hardest thinl to get is 
what I needed the most. It's the 
same old thing," Finlan said. 

While it might seem to some 
that Finlan is wasting his time 

fighting the univenity, it should 
be pointed out that so far he has 
won several battles in his own 
dispute with campus officials 
conl%minl aUe&cd violations of 
his privacy rilhts. 

"The most important thing a 
student can do is not to live up, 
but to put time into correcting a 
problem they may have," Finlan 
said. 

Finlan urses students to use the 
Student Lepl Services program 
as well as the Office of the Stu-
dent Advocate. 

Student Lepl Services provides 
aeneral lepl advice to students 
free of charge. However, the uni-
venity prohibits the service's 

counseling attorney to represent 
students in cases dealing with the 
univenity. 

"Students should freely use both 
offices and take advantage of 
every resource available to them," 
Finlan says. "I can and will do my 
best to ensure that the univenity 
follows proper procedures. I can 
save students a lot of time by help-
ing them circumvent the bureau-
cratic nightmare." 

In the future, FinJan would like 
to see the univenity hire a profes-
sional or full-time student advo-
cate or oms bud penon who is 
either a lawyer or paralepl. 

"Students need someone who 

Monday, SeptemlHr 19. 1988 23 

FEATURES 
can lend consistency to the offi~ 
from year to year," FinJan said. 

"The problem with the student 
advocate is that the position 
changes each school year. If you 
set an A.S. that isn't watching 
closely, the administration can 
seize the opportunity to dilute 
student rights." 

Confidentiality is guaranteed 
at Student Legal Services and at 
the Office of the Student Ad-
vocate. 

Student Legal Services is 
located in building "8" of the 
Student Center. The Office of the 
Student Advocate is located 
upstairs in the A.S. offices in 
building "A" of the Student 
Center.

WELCOME BACK! The Biology Deportmenrs faculfy and 
staff are eagerly looking forward to the upcoming year 
and hope to be able to assist you in your academic 
goals. As port of that assistance. we would like to inform 
you of some changes in the biology majors and keep 
you abreast of current departmental policies. 

The major change in the biology curriculum is that 
Biology 1. 2. and 3 are no longer requirements for any of 
the biology majors. While these courses are no longer 
major requirements. it Is STRONGlY RECOMMENDED that 
students complete these courses In preporatlon for 
upper-division biology course work. Transfer students are 
encouraged to review the Biology 1. 2. and 3 syllabi and 
previous exams (available in the Biology Student Affairs 
Office) and make the Judgment of equivalence to 
transfer coursework. It should be noted that admission to 
some of the biology upper-division courses requires 
verification that students have satisfied the prerequisites 
of Biology 1. 2. and/or 3. and enrollment priority may be 
given to students meeting prerequisites. Furthermore. 
Biology Deportment upper-division course content will 
continue to assume that prerequisites have been met. 
and all Instructors have the right to refuse enrollment to 
students lacking prerequisites. 

The Biology Student Affairs Office has numerous 
handouts available to inform biology majors of the latest 
departmental poliCies on topics such as submitting 
petitions. EAP/OAP requirements. necessary transfer 
documentation. graduate requirements. etc. It Is the 
studenrs responsibility to be aware of. and to complete. 
all departmental graduation requirements prior to 
offiCial graduation. Therefore. students should obtain 
copies of these handouts early In thelr UCSD careers to 
be Informed of these requirements. Incoming students 
(freshmen) who expect to became b iology majors.

more advanced students contemplating declaring a 
biology major. and especially transfer students are 
strongly urged to check with the Student Affairs Office 
01 soon 01 po"''''' to make sure that their plans for 
courses will meet the requirements for their desired 
majors, That office also assists students with routine 
matters such as add/drops. lab enrollments. etc. Staff 
undergraduate advisors are available to provide 
scheduling counsel. degree checks. assistance with 
preparation with petitions. etc. 

In addition to staff advisors, there are "designated 
faculty advisors" for each of the six biology majors. 
Faculty advisors are available for academic counseling 
within their major. and only the deIIgnated faculty 
advisor Is empowered ta approve petlllani within that 
motor. Students who wish to have a petition (or another 
form) signed by a faculty advisor. should contact one of 
the staff undergraduate advisors first as It is necessary for 
students' records to be sent to the appropriate faculty 
advisor prior to the signing of the petition or form. 
Contact the Student Affairs Office to obtain the listing of 
" Designated faculty advisors." As a courtesy. students 
should telephone the faculty advisors first to schedule 
an appointment. 

The general biology faculty are. of course. available for 
counseling within their individual areas of expertise. both 
professional ( e.g .• career choices) and academic ( e.g .• 
what the prerequiSites are for a course they are 
teaching). 
For further Information regarding the biology majors. 
please contact the Student Affairs Office at 534.QS57. 
Please note: The Biology Deportment·s Student Affairs 
Office may be moved prior to Fall Quarter: therefore. 
please call that number to verify the location.

1 (The Cell), 101 (Biochemistry 1), III (Cell Biology), or 
131 (GenetiCS) can enroll now because adequate sized 

classrooms have been made avallable.

Commentary. 

Deep imide 
the NFL 
By MIKE MARTINEZ 
Contributm, Writer 

"Give us dirty Immdry. H 
- Don Henley 

Well, for starters, let's 
throw out the obliptory pro 
football prediction angle. 111 
leave that little chore of 
hokum and fun to the local 
beat writer because my heart's 
not in it. The season's already 
three weeks old, and the 
Charsen'stock is so low for 
1988 that I sit longing for the 
reverie of last year's replace-
mentpmes. 

My mind's not on bow the 
CharFn can stop Elway, or 
how the EaJlel are the "real 
tbina. ". want to know what's 
wrong with Dexter Manley, 
Lawrence Taylor, and 
Charles White? Is Oilers 
coach Jerry Glanville going 
to leave a couple of free passes 
for Jim Morrison at next 
Sunday's game? 

Important NFL question 
for 1988: On which part of 
her body does Brigette N ield-
sen have boyfriend Mark 
Gastineau's initials tattoed? 
Answer: On her buttock, with 
the rest of the G '5. 

What the hell is going on 
here? Let me explain. ]n the 
last 30 years, America has 
shifted from an industrial 
society to an information 
society. As the business of 
information becomes bigger, 
so does society's need for it. 
After all, "recreational" 
information is big business, 
too. By its nature, not all of 
this new information can be 
englightening, or of redeem-
ing value. A lot of it will be 
fluff, bluff, junk, or mean 
gossip. This was always true 
of old show biz rages like 
Photoplay. Our information 
society later provided Na-
tional Enquirer, People. and 
USA Today amona othen 
for our info fIX. 

It was inevitable that sports 
journalism would begin to 
reflect our relentless need for 
news. Along with the old 
school of traditional report-
ing and the more contem-
porary "irreverent" camp, 
there is a less noble wing of 
the fourth estate. It peddles 
smarmy innuendos and snide 
asides ... and it shamelessly 
indulges in fint-stone cast-
ing. And yes, it fills a need. 

Now we know who's a 
junkie and a drunk, who's in 
hock to his bookies, who 
took money illegally while in 
college. That's sports in the 
'80s. We've become so numb 
to it that this kind of stuff 
becomes just another stat in 
the sports section. Check last 
Wednesday's San Diego 
Union, dated Sept. 14, 1988.

Cross Country 
Competes at 
UCLA AII-
Comers Meet 

The UCLA All-Comen Meet, 
held on September 11th, pve 
UCSD runners a chance to com-
pete against heavy competition 
and to get their feet wet for what 
should be a succcsful '88 cross-
country season. 

For the men, the highest UCSD 
finisher in the 5K. race was Merrill 
Hora who placed eighth (just two 
seconds out of seventh) among a 
large field of runners. UCLA 
runner Jim Ortiz won the race 
with a time of 19.19. Other UCSD 
finishers include Jeff Gregg (20.47, 
30th), and Eric K.inney (21.27, 
46th) and Jason Debley. 

Tessie Hartman's 18.58 time in 
the three mile race enabled her to 
finish 17th in the women's div-
ision. Hartman was the top Triton 
fmisher, two spots ahead of Denise 
McFayden. The latter, fi~hing 
with a time of 19.11, had an out-
standing season last year as a 
freshman for UCSD. 

Rounding out the Triton wo-
men runners were MicheUe Con-
lay (20.04, 28th), Gisele English 
(20.30, 32nd), and Iris Gonzales 
(20.59, 35th). 

Though the finishes for both 
the Triton men and women run-
ners may seem low, the fact that 
much of the competition came 
from Division I schools (UCLA, 
Univenity of Arizona, etc.) and 
unattached runnen must be taken 
into consideration. 

One will get a better sense of 
how the UCSD cross-country 
team stacks up against competi-
tion more its own size when it 
hosts an Invitational on October 
1st. Untilthcn, the Triton runners 
will have to settle for the SDSU 
Invitational to be held at Morley 
Field this Saturday.

The strongpoint of last year's

defense. This year's squad has 
alre.ldy played six games, and if

United States International Uni-
versity (USlU) back on Sept. 5. 
Like the volleyball team, the 
women's soccer team had to cut 
their summer vacation short and 
were required to be in town well 
before school began. 

USlU, a Division I school 
comprised virtually of former high 
school select all-stars from around 
San Diego area, were the obvious 
favorites . It was a close game all 
the way through, with neither 
team ever holding more than a 
one goal lead at any time. Fresh-
man sensation Katy Dulock 

Dulock continued with her high 
school heroics the next day when 
she poured in three goals to run 
her total on the .young season up 
to six as UCSD destroyed Tour-

two goals of her own while dish-
ing out three assists, and Teresa 
Schwaar also had three assists. 

A few hours later, the Triton

UCSD received a preseason 

ranking of No. 7 in Division III, 
but when the next rankings come 
out, it is likely the Tritons will be 
in the top five .. 

Yesterday, the Tritons extended 
their streak of shutouts to five as 
they whipped Whittier CoUege by 
a 3-0 score. Heather Mauro scored 
twice, running her season total to 
five, and Stephanie Savoy scored 
once.

give the Tritons a 2-1 halftime

USIU tied it up again at 2-2 in 
the second half, but with 12 min-
utes remaining, junior Felicia Faro 
booted a 4O-yard goal which 
proved to be the difference as the 
Tritons narrowly escaped with a

The Tritons handled Occiden-

game at the Pomona-Pitzer Tour-

Women's Volleyball Off to Great Start 
By PHIL GRUEN 
SporlS Edilor 

Summer vacation may be com-
ing to a conclusion in a few days 
for most of you, but for the 
UCSD women's volleyball team, 
it ended weeks ago. 

Classes do not officially begin 
until Thursday, but last year's 
Division 1Il championship squad 
has already compiled a 13-1 record 
and appears to be heading for 
the' third consecutive volleyball 
championship. 

Most recently, UCSD com-
peted in the University of La 
Verne Invitational on Friday and 
Saturday. Although it was not 
easy, UCSD managed to emerge 
victorious in all six of its weekend 
matches to improve its record to 
13-\. 

In order for the Tritons to 
reach the semi-finals of the tour-
nament, they needed to win all 
four of their games in pool play 
on Friday. With primarily Div-
ision II teams slated for competi-
tion, the Tritons knew they had 
their work cut out for them. Never-
theless, UCSD, with tough victo-
ries over Westmont College, 
Occidental, and Chapman (and 
one easy win over Sonoma St.), 
advanced to Saturday's semifinals. 

After pulling out another close 
match with Chapman, UCSD had 
to claw its way back from an I I-I 
deficit in the second game against 
12th-ranked Cal Poly Pomona 
(Division II) to win the finals of 
the tournament 15-8, 16-14. 

The victory over Occidental 
marked the 34th consecutive win 
for UCS D 0 Division III 
opponents, da ' ng all the way 
back to 1986. 

The Tritons opened the season 
with six consecutive victories at 
the Fresno-Pacific Early Bird 
Tournament with two victories 
over both Chapman and Lewis & 
Clark as well as single victories 
over Seattle-Pacific and Chico St. 
In the finals of the tournament, 
Chapman put up a decent fight 
but still fell to the mighty Tritons 
15-12,7-15, and 15-4. 

All-American candidates Diana 
Klintworth and Rachel Vetter 
were both selected to the All-

Tournament team, with Vetter 
also earning the MVP award for 
the whole tourney. 

Nearly a week later UCSD tra-
veled to the state capitol to face 
powerful Sacramento St ., a team 
claiming the # I national ranking 
in Division II. Not surprisingly, 
Sacramento St. beat the Tritons 
convincingly, sweeping them 5-
15, 11-15, and 11- 15. The loss 
ended a current twelve game win-
ning streak for UCSD, dating six 
games back into last year's 
schedule. 

must find the right combinations 
withiq a strong group of young 
returnees and an outstanding 
recruiting class in order to con-
tinue a tradition of championship-
caliber teams. Last year, the Trit-
ons became the first Division 1lI 
volleyball team to win back· to-
back national titles, and the first 
women's volleyball team at any 
level to win four championships. 
UCSD also captured national 
crowns in 1981 and 1984. 

"The loss of four starters left us 
with an obviously younger team 

American selection. 
Five players who saw signifi-

cant action in over half of the 
team's games last year also return. 
They are senior hitter Dee Dee 
Bigelow, junior hitter Jennifer 
Wellman, sophomore hitter 
Rachel Vetter, sophomore hitter 
Allison Hensleit and sophomore 
blocker Becky Palmer. Palmer is 
the heir-apparentto Hughes's spot 
in the starting six, while Vetter 
emerged as a premier substitute: 
last year and should vie for a start-
ingjob. 

From left 10 right: Dee Dee Bigelow and Diana Klintworth stand ready as Ellen Chi digs one for the 
Tritons 
The Triton women defeated and, as far as I can tell, the other 

Menlo College three games to one Division III teams in the West did 
a few nights later in Menlo. 
Preview: 

U C San Diego volleyball coach 
Doug Dannevik welcomes back 
12 players from last year's NCAA 
Division III national champion-
ship squad. That's the good news. 
The bad news is that the four 
players lost were starters, includ-
ing a pair of All-Americans in 
Carol Lipson and Janet Hughes. 
Also gone are Lori Luhnow and 
Jennifer Pettigrew. 

Dannevik's task is obvious. He 

not lose as much," Dannevik said. 
"The combination of those two 
factors should make for a very 
competitive West Region this 
year." 

The Tritons are led by return-
ing junior Diana Klintworth, an

that she'll be able to fill the shoes

future for UCSD. Jenifer Dod-
son, a 5-11 middle blocker, played 
volleyball at Atascadero High 
School in San Luis Obispo before 
graduating from Robert Louis 
Stevenson in Monterey. And 
Vikki Van Duyne,a~1 I hitter, comes 
to UCSD from Bullard High 
School in Fresno. 

Having posted a 72-10 record 
over the past two seasons, includ-
ing the active streak of 31 consec-
utive victories against Division 
III competition, Dannevik now 
faces a formidable schedule with 
his youthful team. The Tritons 
will play at least 17 Matches, 
depending on tournament brackets, 
before finally opening their home 
schedule on Sept. 28 against 
San Diego State. I doesn't get any 
easier, as UCSD will face strong 
representatives from each volley-
ball division: William and Mary, 
U.S. International and SDSU 
from Division I; UC Riverside, 
Chapman, CS u-Sacramento, CSU-
Dominguez Hills, CSU-Bakers-
field, and CSU Los Angeles from 
Division II: Biola, Point Loma 
Nazarene, Grand Canyon and The 
Master's from the NAIA; and of 
course Division III rivals CSU-
San Bernardino, Menlo, La Verne 
and Pomona-Pitzer. 

"We definitely have a tough 
schedule this season," Dannevik 
commented. "But in terms of wins 
and losses, I can't control any-
thing except how hard we work in 
practice. If we do work hard, we 
will have a very successful year." 

In the 1987 season, the pressure 
of defending the national cham-
pionship was present from begin-
ning to end. But this year Dan-
nevik says the pressure has been 
lifted. 

"I don't really feel like we're 
being looked at as defending cham-
pions with so few starters return-
ing, " the coach said.

Also returning are four players 
who redshirted during the '87 
campaign: junior setter Linda 
Ross, junior blocker Beth Selby, 
sophomore blocker Elizabeth Tan 
and sophomore hitter Dana Simone. 

Dannevik rates his recruiting 
class among the best he's had in 
ten years as head coach of the 
Tritons. Stephanie Eischen, a 5-7 

Nevertheless, the "Drive for Five" 
has already begun, and UCSD 
has shown no signs of slowing 
down just yet. Considering the 
youth of the team, that fifth 
national title might not come this 
year, or even next, but rest assured 
that Dannevik and the Tritons 
are not content to stop at four.

and will play in the Pomona-

end of the 23rd .

Though not quite as successful 
so far this season as their female 
counterparts, the UCSD men's 
soccer team has broken quicldy 
out of the starting gate and are 
currently 441. 

If the first few games tell us 
anything about the future, the 

• Triton men will do better if they 
stay away from UCSD. In the 
Tritons' only home game this 
year, Cal State Stanislaus pulled 
an upset over the 13th ranked 
UCSD by forcing a 3-3 tie. 

As a matter offact, the Tritons 
were fortunate to escape with the 

, tie, for they only managed to knot 
the game at 3 goals apiece when 
junior Carrick Brewster scored 
for the second time with 1:36 
remaining. 

Nevertheless, on the road , 

UCSD has achieved great suc-
cess. The Tritons opened the sea-
son with back-to-back wins at 
Whittier and Biola on Sept. 7 and 
9, respectively. 

Against Whittier, single goals 
from Eric Dingwall and freshman 
Chris Hanssen propelled the 
Tritons to a 2~ opening~ay vic-
tory. Two days later, goals from 
Scott Rommell and Brewster 
provided the needed edge to push 
UCSD past Biola by a 2-1 score. 

After playing Cal St. Stanis-
laus to the tie, the Tritons 
rebounded strongly against Oc-
cidental and trounced them 5~ 
last Wednesday. The Tritons'per-
formance in the first half, how-
ever, was far from dominating as 
they managed only one Mike 
Kappes goa\. 

In the second half, however, 
two goals from both Wally Whit-
tier and Rommell gave Derek 

Armstrong's squad its 5~ victory. 
The Triton defense allowed no 
shots on goal as keeper Brian SiJ-
jander recorded his second shu-
tout of the year. 

Yesterday, the Tritons blanked 
Cal State Los Angeles 3~ for 
their second consecutive shutout 
and their third in five games. The 
Tritons extended their lead in the 
second half by goals from Whit-
tier and Scott Goodman. Whit-
tier's goal came with only one 
minute remaining. 

As usual, it was the Triton 
defense which enabled the team 
to improve its record to its current 
4-0-1 standing. Cal St. l.A. was 
only permitted two shots on goal 
as Siljander, who played the entire 
game, put another shutout under 
his belt . 

The UCSD men's soccer team 
returns home to face UC Irvine 
this Wednesday. Gametime is 
3:30 p.m. at Warren Field .

Tangerine Drea~ 
Continued from pase 1 
have earned five gold albums 
and sold out two American 
concert tours, In the middle of 
their 24 city North American 
tour, the band is scheduled to 
stop on September 21 st to 
perform at the California Thea-
tre in San Diego, The show, 
featuring a gigantic laser dis-
play, will highlight "Optical 
Race," Tangerine Dream's 
latest album, Special guest 
Andy Summers, ex-guitarist for 
the Police, is joining the band on 
this tour, 

Influenced by psychedelia and 
experimentation, the band is 
known for its raging. surreal 
style. Edgar Froese founded the 
group in 1967 and, like many 
other German artists, they 
created a sound so universal it 
defied the conventional boun-
daries placed on musicians. This 
sense of universality is the 
cause of their success 
throughout Europe, America, 
Australia and the Eastern Bloc, 

Toward the end of the 19708, 
Tangerine Dream began to 
experiment with film and tele-
vision scores. Beginning with 
William Friedkin's 1977 film 
'The Sorcerer," they contrib-
uted to soundtracks including 
"Legend," "Thief," "Firestarter," 
"Risky Business," snd "Shy 
People." Their latest work, for 
the upcoming Tri-Star film 
"Miracle Mile," will be released 
some time this month. 

Critics have never been able 

to comfortably categorize 
Tangerine Dream, regardless 
of their 25 group albums and 
over a dozen soundtracks. The 
group sways between becom-
ing a prominent figure in the 
progressive rock scene to 
withdrawing into the studio as 
a tracking machine. Yet their 
consistent musical growth, 
from the rock vocals on the 
album "Cyclone." to Froese's 
work with surrealist painter 
Salvador Dali. allows them to 
successfully attempt various 
enterprises . 

The trio has obviously influ-
enced groups who prominently 
utilize the synthesizer. When 
listening to the work of such 
artists as Jan Hammer, De-
peche Mode and Propaganda, 
you pick up the subtle nuances 
reminiscent of Tangerine 
Dream. 

Although they have often 
been labeled as "rock," their 
music, like the members 
themselves, tends to lean 
toward a more classical struc-
ture. The 44 year-old Froese, 
the only original member of the 
trio, shares the writing and 
producing credit with Paul Has-
linger and Ralf Wadephul. Has-
linger, who joined the band in 
19B5, studied at the Vienna 
Academy of Music; Wadephul, 
the youngest and latest addi-
tion to Tangerine Dream, will 
graduate next February from 
the Berlin Conservatorium of 
Music.

Hot lllusic months 
by patty ;ettie 

hianu writer 

L.A.·s music scene is at its apex 
during the summer months. As 
the weather heats up. bands leave 
the studio and begin promoting. 
their albums. 

In early August. Erasure per-
formed twice in Los Angeles. one 
night at the Palace. the other at 
Irvine Meadows Amphitheater. A 
low-budget show, the band tended 
to lean toward a somber. almost 
religious atmosphere. A series of 
slides, ranging from clapping hands 
to geometric figures, were inter-

. mittently flashed against the back 
of the stage. It was refreshing not 
to be dazzled by giant screens or 
intricate light shows. 

Musicianship. however, was not 
one of the band's primary con-
cerns. Vincent Clarke, the only 
individual within reach of an 
instrument, was shoved off to the 
far right of the stage. Erasure 's live 
show was the equivalent of pop-
ping a tape into the stereo and 
watching it spin. As you listen to 
the intricate flute trills and the 
pounding bass line, it's scary to 
realize that no one is touching any-
thing. There was a nagging feeling 
of watching an air band perform. 

Hence image, especially the sta2t' 

presence of singer Andrew Bell, is 
the only outstanding aspect of the 
performance. The flamboyant Bell 
preened and pranced about like a 
peacock, dressed in shimmering 
black spandex shorts, sheer black 
stockings, metallic boots and a 
single black satin and rhinestone 
gold. 

Uke hundreds of other groups, 
Erasure is an average band able to 
proouce poppy tunes which re-
ceive heavy rotation on the top 
forty radio stations. 

In early September, the Sugar-
cubes performed two nights at the 
Roxy club. The Icelandic band is a 
bundle of delightful, yet puzzling, 
contradictions. On one Side, the 
group's musical style is a combi-
nation ofU2's sincerity, the Talk-
ing Head's dancibility and sheer, 
raw energy reminiscent of the

Donkey Show haS kick

The original donkey shows 

took place in Tijuana years ago. 
Today, if you ask to seea donkey 
show, while in Mexico, the cab 
driver will probably take you toa 
back alley , take all your money 
and leave you stranded - the 
infamous show is a scam. The 
rude tradition, if it ever existed 
beyond tall-tale adventures south 
of the border, is carried on by the 
San Diego spawned ska/reggae 

Their recent successful cross-
country tour sold-out records 
and tapes across the board. Inter-
national radio airplay combined 
with being chose n to repres-
ent the West Coast on a compila-
tion ska record released by lon-
don's Unicorn Recorda titled 
"Skanking Around The World" 
is no scam donkey show. It should 
be taken seriously. 

Their sound is made up of 
honking horns, lively keyboards, 
and percussion mixed in with

greatfully interrupted by the dis-
tinct and sulrry voice of singer 
Kym Clift. 

Donkey Show was starred three 
years ago by sax player Dave Hil-
lyard and percussionist Rob 
Dominguez. Trombone player 
and band promoter , Stan 
"Bronco" Farwell followed and 
three years later were joined by 
current members including vo-
calists Kvm Clift and Ray Camp-
bell, guitarist Chris Bates, bassist 
Tom Zambrano, kevboardiat Matt 
Parker, and drummer Kent 
Graves. 

The "skanking" sounds were 
popularized by the English Beat, 
Madness, The Specials, Selector. 
and Bad Manners. But the lively 
dance han sounds seemed to die 
out about four years ago. A res-
urgance across the country of the 
ska sound is occurring. thanks to 
a handful of bands including the

and Bim-Skala-Bim from Boston.

Hutnan Rights Now! 
by patty jettie 

hiarul wrirer 

The concert of the year, 
Amnesty International's Human 
Rights Now! tour will be at the 
Los on Sep-

to 
United 

States: today in Philadelphia, at 
JFK Stadium, in Los Angeles on 
September 19 and at San Fran-
cisco's Oakland Coliseum on Sep-
tember 23. The world tour will 
-;:over five continents, perform-
'ing in such countries as Canada, 
Italy, Japan, Hungary, Costa Rica, 
Brazil and Argentina. 

Bruce Springsteen, Sting and 
Peter Gabriel will each perform 
one-hour sets which will include 
music created especially for the 
tour. A unique musical collabo-
ration among the artists is also 
planned for the over one-million 
people who are expected to attend 
the concerts world-wide. 

1988 marks the 40th anniver-

sary of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights. The Human 
Rights Now! tour will focus world 
attention on the Declaration by 
encouraging individuals to know 
the rights guaranteed by world 
governments. The concert has 
been organized by Concerts for 
Human Rights Foundation, a 
non-profit organization. The goal 

of the Human Rights Now! tour 
is to raise consciousness, not 
money. 

According to Amnesty Inter-

national, " This tour plans to gen-
erate an undeniable, irresistable 
force to save lives, stop torture 
and free prisoners of conscience. 
The tour will talee the great 
promise of the Universal Decla-
ration of Human Rights to peo-
ple who will demand that these 
rights become a reality." 

By visiting countries outside 
the Western world, the group 
hopes to apply direct pressure to 
both the visited governments and 
the surrounding countries. 

Sting and Peter Gabrielare in LA today CO promoce human rights. 

p and coming bands 
by larry weintraub 

hiahlt writer 

With bands such as U2 and INXS achieving phenomenal 
success in the highly competitive world of music, one has to 
wonder who the next rising stan will be. The answer usually lies in 
the college radio market. Th~y are often the only stations willing 
to give new bands a chance. The heavy airplay combined with 
steady album sales, and an exceptional amount of talent, occa-
sionally produces a star. 

In the put, bands such as the Police and U2 appealed to mass 
audiences under a commercially accessible umbrella. Now many 
of the current notable acts fall into categories ranging from rap to 
psychedelia to hard rock. 

In an area that has been dubbed the punic movement of the late 
1980s, rap music has spawned several superstars. The reigning 
champs Run DMC and the controversial Beastie Boys seem to 
have faded from the limelight. However it's invigorating to sample 
the fresh rhymes ofDJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince. Combining 
humor, autobiography, and sensitivity in their second album, 
"He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper," Jeff and Prince deviate from the 
tough and often raunchy rap norm. Fueled by the success of their 
hits "Parent Just Don't Understand" and "Nightmare on My 
Street" the duo's latest effort has already sold well over a million 
copies and is destined to be one of the biggest selling albums of the 
year. Aided by a tremendous follOWing and a keen business sense

tudents fence art 
by cynthia campbell 

a lociate hiatus editor 

Six graduate art students from 
UCSD have given the public a 
display of their talents by trans-
forming a construction barrier 
into a panel of murals. 

Originally the 400-foot fence 
was built to enclose the $52 mil-
lion La Jolla Exe utiV<' Tower , 
[ ca ted on Execut ive Square 
Drive and Regents Park Row. 
Collaboration between UCSD's 
art department, Alan 1. Kay Com-
panies, Regents Park Streets and 
CommerCial Association as well 
as other ponsors , provided the 

financial and legal assistance 
needed for the project. 

The six students worked with 
one assistant on five ommis-
sions. Esther Barath and C. Love 
employed designs from an :ient 
Chinese embroidery to create a 
135· foot long mural. Both are in 
their final year of M.F.A. study. 

A mural depi ting emblems of 
automobiles and other commer-
cial objects in a geometric pattern 
IS the work of John Kannofsky 
and assisrant Laurie Brown. Kan-
nofsky is in his second year of 
M.F.A. study. 

Michael Weix created a sym-
bolic mural design incorporating 

a tr~c and hillside, shown with a 
coiled snake which turns into a 
hand reaching for an umbrella. 
He feels it "represents the uni -
versal forces that are at play in 
the world." 

Cindy Tower's mural, "The 
Aspha lt Garden," shows a white 
picket fence against a blue sky, 
juxtaposed with a rendition of a 
formal garden painted in various 
hues of grey and white . Last year 
Tower had three shows in New 
York City. 

Perhaps the most interesting is 
the mural by sculptor Fred 
Thieme. His mural, "Wind Them 
Up," consists of hundreds of 
tiny musIc boxes which the viewer 
can wind up and listen to.

Continued from pale 4 
\ish in order to avoid alienating 
American audiences. 

"Motorcrash," for example, 
depicts the simple tale of a traffic 
accident. Bjork Gudmundsdottir , 
in her clear, dramatic voice, tells 
how a girl, at the scene of a crash, 
helps an injured woman get home. 
Once there, the woman is yelled at 
for being late. But a condemning 
voice (that of Einar Beneditlcsson) 

reveals that the girl on the bicycle 
was always " happening" upon 
such accidents. Is the girl inno-
cent, or is she somehow responsi-
ble for these incidents? 

Don't count on a live show to 
solve the Sugarcubes puzzle. Their 
stage show is as unpredictable as 
the album. The members' fun-
loving personalities are evident as 
they burst out on stage wearing 
neon sunglasses, cracking jolces 
and dancing wildly.

tCommissar' is a 
glasnost release 

by michele youmans America and the United States. 
Scene after scene of repression of 
the Jewish family creates a need 
for comparison to the Holocaust. 
In one surreal image, which is 
actually just a glimpse into 
Klavdia's troubled conscious , 
the Jewish family is being herded 
into a primitive gas chamber. 
With the glowing stars of David 
pasted to their arms, the Jewish 
family proceeds in a death march 
to the caverns of their mortality . 

One can also watch the inter-
nalization of the repression in the 
way that the Jewish children play 
and relate to each other. A scene 
in which the children are playing 

together slowly metamorphses, 
until one realizes the children are 
playing a game of pretend in 
which they repeatedly harass and 
kill Jews. This example of learned 
self-harred and persecution cul-
minates in the child's play of stal-
ing a pogrom (an organized mll-
sacre of Jews) against the eldest 
sister. The five younger children 
enthUSiastically attach their sister 
amidst cries of "Jew-bitch" and 
"dirty yid." 

These scenes clearly implicate 
Russia through its charges of 
anti-semitism, and' it is specifi-
cally for this reason that the film 
was banned. At one time Asleol-
dov was offered suggestions as to 

what it would take to release his 
film. If only he would change the 
nationality of the Jewish family 
and eliminate the gas-chamber 
scene, the film would have a 
chance at being screened. How-
ever, Aakoldov refused. 

Why would a man, who, by 
the way, is not Jewish, jeopardize 
and ultimately ruin his career to 
reveal Russian anti-semitism? 
Aakoldov maintains that it was 
his duty to make "Commissar." 
He feels that the film embodies 
his own "hard experiences of 
RUSSian society." 

The Museum of Photographic 
Arts will host the screening of 
"Commissar" on Sunday, Oct. 2 

at .. and 7 p.m., at Sherwood 
Auditorium, La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art, 700 Prospect 
Street, La Jolla. 

Ticket are $10 for students 
and seniors, $15 for general 
admission, and can be purchased 
at the Museum of Photographic 
Arts of through TicketMaater. 

A reception including ticket 
price, reserved seating, Russian 
fare , will be held between the two 
screenings from 6-7 p .m. for $50 
a person in the courtyard adja -
cent to the Sherwood Audito-
rium. Reservations for the recep-
tion must be made in advance by 
calling MoPA at 239-5262. 

Rolan Bykow Iead.s a group of Jewish people in the Swift film "Commissar." 

Alexander Asleoldov's " Com-
missar" is a timeless and univer-
sal film . Perhaps this is why the 
film has the ability to entertain 
today altho ugh it was created 20 
years ago. In 1968, " Commis-
sar" was banned by Soviet 
authorities for its implication that 
anti-semitism existed in Russia. 
Askoldov was also banned as a 
filmmaker. After its banishment, 
Askoldov had thought that the 
film had been lost forever . 
Unbeknownst to him, his wife 
had a copy of the film in their 
laundry room. Since 1968 it had 
waited for someone, or some-
thing, to allow its exposure. The 
film survived the two decades, ,------------------- --- - - - --- ------------------- -----
preserved and ready for the cur-
rent period of "peresrroika." 

In fact, Mikhail Gorbachev was 
among the first to view "Com-
missar," and it is Gorbachev spe-
cifically, that Askoldov wishes to 
thank for the film '5 release. Under 
the first auspices of "glasnost," 
the Soviet Filmmakers Union was

a one-day double 
screening at the L]MCA 

restructured, and restnctlons 
relaxed . Even more important , a 
Conflict Commission was estab-
lished to review and release films 
that had once been banned. Of all 
the 140 films that were prohi-
bited by the authorities, "Com-
missar" was the last to be released. 

At the 1987 Moscow Film Fes-
tival, authorities allowed Askol-
dov to speak and then finally 
relented to a screening of his 
film. Last summer the film was 
allowed to travel to the Interna-
tional Berlin Festival where it 
received four awards . More 
important than any awards, the 
Soviet audience will finally be 
able to see its own film this 
month. 

The film is set in the Southern 
Ukraine at the time of the civil 
war between the Reds and the 
Whites. Klavdia is a dedicated 
and stoic Commissar with the 
Red Army. She finds herself in 
the embarassing situation of being 
pregnant during a war. To make 
matters worse, she is told that "a 
pregnant woman must be re-
placed" and she is sent off to live 
within a crowded Jewish home. 
Eventually, Klavdia feels the love 
of this happy and humble Jewish 
family, yet remains separated by 
her ideologies. Finally, when her 
child is born, she discovers her 
hidden maternal feelings and 
revels in motherhood. However, 
when the war looms closer, she 
abandons both the child and the 
Jewish family, succumbing to the 
call to defend RUllia. 

The controversy lay not as 
much in the storyline as in the, 
painful and brutal images of thel 
film . The Jewish family repres-
ents a microcosm, not only of the 
persecuted Jew(s) of Russia, but 
also the Jew of Germany , South

t80 days' of thrills 
bv isabelle tihanyi 

hianu writer 

Have you driven past the Man-
dell Weiss Theatre lately? Noticed 
anything unusual? A hot air bal-
loon on the front lawn perhaps? If 
so, you've had an encounter with 
the tip. The tip of the iceberg, as 
they say. 

What happens to be going on 
inside that mysterious building is 
something big. A delicious strudel 
of music, adventure and laughter. 
It is called "80 Days" and it is 
gaining a lot of anention. 

Inspired by the 1873 French 
novel "Around the World in 80 
Days" by Jules Verne the play is 
the firat collaboration of composer 
and lyricist Ray Davies, legendary 
rocker of the Kinks, with British 
playwright and satirist Snoo Wil-

son and director Des McAnuff, 
the La Jolla Playhouse's Tony 
award winning artistic director. 

W riter Jules Verne (Stephen 
Bogardus) creates the fantastic 
story under strict deadline which 
he must meet in order to get his 
book to the publisher in time. The 
adventure is that of Phileas Fogg 
(Timothy Landfield) and Verne 
in their anempt at the impossible: 
to circumnavigate the world in 80 
days. 

By land and by seas, by steam-
boat, elephant, hot air balloon and 
ice clipper, Fogg and Verne cover 
the corners of the earth. They are 
being followed by a desperately 
over-eager English detective (Don 
Amensolia) who accuses Fogg of 
bankrobbery . 

through their voyages come 
scenes of beautiful exotic jungles, 

In "80 DaYJ," MfJ. Fix (Brooks Almy) and the Gooemor of Bombay (Paul 
Kandel) became f(JJe !riendJ in India. 

rivers, and cine, which are com-
parable to the most fantastic rides 
at Disneyland. From the raging 
Parisian nightlife through tropical 
Indian jungles to the American 
Wild West, Fogg leeeps his stuffy 
reputation as a "well-bred English-
man." 

Fogg rescues the distinguished 
Princess Aouda (Yami! Borges) 
who sings "Who Is This Man" 
with wonderful projection and 
beauty. Mrs. Fix (Brooks Almy) 
gives a perfect contrast to the 

Princess with her lighthearted 
romances as the inspector's mum 
who follows the little party around 
the world and seems to make the 
best of the situation in every pon. 

"80 Days" is the largest pro-
duction evet performed at Man-
dell Weias Theatre. Behind the 
scenes of this fast-paced journey is 
a huge production including 24 
scenes, ZOO costumes, 204 masks, 
and Z" actors. It is also the most 
expensive show to date, with a

"Private Uves," a 1930 English 
play by Noel Coward currently 
being performed by the Gaslamp 
Theatre Company, p08Cs an inter-
esting question: "You're on your 
honeymoon, your ex-apouae just 
happens to be honey-mooning in 
the suite next door-what would 
you do? 

Rosina Widdowson-Reynolds 
plays Amanda Prynne with heaps 
of elegance and c1all. Her sophis-
tication and dramatic facial ex-
pressions are the highliaht of the 
show. Understandably, she has 
become a Gaslamp favorite . 

Amanda was married to Elyot 
Cllaae, played by Mike nmony, 
for three years, then divorced for 
five. Chase is a violent tempered, 
unstable character who minces no 
words when challenged. nmony 
is very convincing with hi. flip-
pant one-line insults to everyone. 

This entertaining chamber farce 
opens with a look at each couple 
enjoying the first night of their 
honeymoon with their respective 
new spouses, Sibyl and Victor, 
played by Liz Backenstow and 
Paul Eggington. Both are curious 
about the previous marriage which 
they have replaced and constantly 
compare themselves to the ex-
spouses. 

ttprivate Lives" \1

The plot takes off the minute 
Amanda and Elyot rediscover the 
uncontrollable passion and ro-
mance of their past relationship 
which Amanda describes as "chem-

I ical 'whatcha-ma-callums' ". Their only choice is to escape together 
I before it is too late. Director Will Simpson is suc-

cessful in being true to the winy 
and elegant sryle conceived for the 
original production. The glamor-
ous costumes by Dianne Holly are 
perfectly matched to the chic 
characters and scenic design by 
Robert Earl.

So the University of California 
builds everything with grey cement 
blocks. So you can no longer 
bicycle on campus. It's not healthy 
to spend all your time on campus 
anyways. Besides, San Diego offers 
many alternative ways to handle 
time: spend it, pass it, waste it .... 

Balboa Park offers the greatest 
variety of things to do, many of 
them inexpensive or free . The San 
Diego Zoo is on the expensive 
side, around eight dollars, but 
worth it. Now that the summer 
crowds are gone, it's a great place 
to wander around on a cool morn-
ing. The Museum of Natural His-
tory, the Museum of Man and the 
San Diego Museum of Art make 
up the core of the park. 

More innovative places are the 
Reuben H. Fleet Space Theatre, 
the Museum of Photographic Arts 
and the Centro Cultural de la 
Raza. If you are not willing to pay 
for culture, every first Tuesday of 
the month all the museums and 
exhibits are free, and it doesn't 
cost a thing to simply hang out on 
a Sunday afternoon and observe 
the people, pigeons and perfor-
mers. 

The park is also the home of the 
Old Globe Theatre. Ticket prices 
are high but the performances arc 
excellent and previews of plays are 
often gi ven at a reduced admission 
price. 

Bordering Balboa Parle are two 
of the more colorful communities 
in San Di~o, downtown and the 
North ParklHillcrestarea. Down-
town, the San Diego Repertory 
Theati'e performs at the Sixth 
Avenue Playhouse and one street 
over, across from Horton Plaza on 
Fifth, is the Gaslamp Theatre. For 
something different, there is the 
Sushi Performance Gallery on 
Eighth St. Next door to Sushi is 
theJava Coffee House and Gallery, 
which often exhibits local artists. 

A wide variety of out-of-town 
bands, musicians, dance and thea-
tre companies perform at Sym-
phony Hall - home of the San 
Diego Symphony, when it exists -
as well as the California Theatre 

and the Grant Hotel at Horton performs at UCSD's Mandell Weis8 
Plaza are both good places for live Theatre . The La Jolla Museum's 

collection of art is probably the 
best in San Diego. Many private 
galleries provide an array of popu-
lar act, and the Pannikan cafe on 
Girard is a great place to rest and 
relax (although it is not as enter-
taining as the one in Del Mar)

Bands 
Continued from page 6 
(or what people like to see and 
hear, DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh 
Prince will no doubt be making 
albums that are fun and re(re hing 
for years to come. 

Proving that success doesn' t 
happen overnight, Camper Van 
Beethoven has invested several 
years on frustating tours and deal-
ing with reluctant record compan-
ies since their formation at UC 
Santa Cruz. Labeled "Hippies," 
Camper Van Beethoven has man-
aged to consistently outsell each 
of their previous albums since 
their 1985 debut. 

Originally bursting Into cult 
stardom with their hit, "Take the 
Skinheads Bowling" Camper Van 
Beethoven has braved through the: 
complications of independent 
record companies and opening 
slots on major American tours. 
Though the band admits to a long 
and ofren unpleasant road to suc-
cess, Camper Van Beethoven is 
very proud of their first major 
label release, "Our Beloved Revo-
lutionary Sweetheart." 

Tracy Chapman 
Claiming that there was a lot of 

pressure to produce their _ 
album yet, the band has miRaFI 
to retain their psychedelic rooa 
while remaining accessible to many 
different audiences. IXtwecn the 
substantial press and the never-
ending tour (now mOld, headlin-
ing), Camper Van Beethoven', 
popularity is increaainl at lID 
alarming rate. 

More surprising than any other 
event in the current mUlic scene it 
the unexplainable success of Heavy 
Metal and Glam Rock. No doubt 
the hottat of this group and dearly 
bound for ,uperstardom is Guns 
N Roees. Known for their abusive 
and offeflSive on and off sraae 
antics, Guns N ROles has pined a 
reputation as the mOlt recent bad 
boys of Rock 'n' Roll. While thia 
reputation doesn't always benefit 
a band, their debut album, 
"Appetite For Destruction" has 
IOld well over five million copies 
and has spent several weeks at No. 
1 on the charts. 

Singing about sex, drug addic-
tion, and violence, GuflS N Roecs 
have managed to convince top 40 
stations to play the likes of, "Wel-
come to the Jungle" and "Sweet 
Child 0 Mine" after nearly a year 
of no radio airplay. Because of this 
phenomenal success comina from 
their debut album, their follow-up 
is one of the most eqerly antia-
pated albums in years. 

With these credentials it is not 
hard to predict an extremely bright 
future for Guns N Roecs as long as 
they stay alive and out of jail. 

In addition to these bands, aood 
words have to go to the debut 
from Tracy Chapman whose folky 
moatly acoustic album has pr0-
pelled her to the top of the charta. 
Keep an eye out for MinnetOCa 
hard rockers Soul Asylum whose 
debut album may give neighbors 
the Replacements lOme competi-
tion. Finally, watch Iceland', 
Sugar Cubes who have been 
heralded as one of the beat alterna-
tive bands In years.

Antin on cloud nine 

Antin, chairman of UCSD's 
Visual Ans Department, has been 
intrigued by skywriting since his 
early childhood in Rockaway 
Beach, Long Island. During a visit 
to the beach, Antin notired a 
plane spelling out "LJ. Fox Fine 
Furs" in large furry letters. It was a 
simple advertisement but one the 
reader enjoyed trying to complete 
before the writer finished writing 
it. Eleven year old Antin was even 
more impressed by the mysterious 
disappearing act. One moment 
the sky was filled with words, the 
next they were gone. 

Antin felt the second stanza to 
the "Skypoem," which he envi-
sions taking 15 years to complete, 
was much easier to produce than 
the first, but it wasn't without its 
stressful moments. A recent fire in 
San Carlos threatened the slcytyp-
ers from even getting to La JoUa, 
but eventually the five planes were 
able to take off. 

ject was provided by the Alan 1. 
Kay Companies, the construction 
company which built the barrier. 
Kay's regional manager, Peggy 
Martin, said the firm's goal was 
to enhance the visual impact of 
the project while it was under 
construction, and to continue 
with Alan 1. Kay's professional 
philosophy of combining art and 
architecture.

"The central issue is disap-

his mysterious haiku-styled poem. 

Antin recently displayed his 
literary spectacle high above La

random public audience."

ience than those lounging at the 
beach. " I know a few people who 
saw it in Pacific Beach," Antin 
said. 

5kytypers Inc., owned and 
operated by Greg 5tinis, came 
from Palm Springs to do the pro-
ject. There are four skywriters in 
the country, but according to 
Antin, the kind of script they use 
isn't as good as the dot matrix 
style Skytypers is capable of. 
Unfortunately, Stinis' is the only 
sky typing company in the coun-

Some forty years later Antin 
decided [0 fill the sky over Santa 
Monica Pier with the fi rst stanza to 
his highly conceprual"Skypoem." 
Finding someone for the job was 
more difficult than Antin antici-
pated. " A lot of people advertise, 
but nobody really does it," he 
said. "Except Greg Stinis." 

When the two men met for the 
first time, they discovered they 
had more in common than a fasci-
nation with skywriting. Antin 

Once in the air, they discovered 
one of the plane's computers 
wasn't working and it was too late 
to fix it, so the pilot had to operate 
the skywriting controls manually, 
which Antin claims is very diffi-
cult. But Antin seems to enjoy this 
kind of nervous energy. "The 
marks of a str\l8lle were interest-
ing to me-it created a drama," he 
said. 

Antin hasn't the vaguest idea 
what the third stanza will say, but 
he suspects it will be skywritten 
between La Jolla and Santa Bar-
bara, One thing is certain, the p0e-
try will be what Antin calls "the 
occasion and the culminating 
point."

Martin met with Marriott gen-
eral manager Reint Reinders and 
Stanley Chodorow, dean of 
UCSD's Arts and Humanities, to 
discuss using the fence as an art 
project. Chodorow collaborated 
with Visual Arts Chairman David 
Antin who thought the project 
would be a good opportunity for 
the graduate students to exhibit 
as a group. 

Students were invited to sub-
mit proposals for the mural pro-
ject. The best six were selected 
by a panel of judges. 

The project will remain in place 
until mid-aummer 1989.
